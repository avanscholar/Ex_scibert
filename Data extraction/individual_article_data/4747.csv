0,Introduction,"Coalbed methane is an associated resource of coal and belongs to unconventional natural gas. Its heat production is comparable to that of natural gas, and it can be widely used in transportation, chemical industry, power generation, and residential life [1]. The extraction of coalbed methane can not only reduce the risk of gas outburst but also obtain clean energy and increase production efficiency [2,3]. The Average concentration of coal seam gas drainage in China is less than 20%, and the negative pressure of drainage is low. More than 80% of the air entering the drainage system enters through the fissures [4]. Two methods can be used to increase the concentration of gas drainage. One method is to use hydraulic fracturing, hydraulic cutting, and coal seam water injection to solve the problems of micro-pores, low permeability, and high adsorption in the coal seam [5–7]. Another method is to enhance the borehole sealing effect and reduce borehole leakage [8]. The former has been widely used in the coalfield, while the latter still has a lot of room for development of sealing materials. The borehole sealing effect is mainly affected by the roadway pressure relief zone and the broken drilled zone [9,10]. At the initial stage of the formation of the roadway, high concentrated stress and yielding deformation appear on the two sides, and then concentrated stress continues to be transmitted to the inside of the coal until stress reaches a necessary dynamic equilibrium state, resulting in a roadway pressure relief zone [11]. The roadway pressure relief zone’s crushing radius is between 10 and 15 m, and its impact can be eliminated by increasing the sealing length or optimizing the sealing process. For example, Zhang et al. [12] simulated the destruction of coal caused by roadway excavation, analyzed the gas leakage factors in the process of gas drainage, determined the distribution range of the shaping zone and elastic zone, found a reasonable sealing depth, slot location, and grouting parameters. By comparing different sealing technologies, they verified the applicability of the integrated sealing technology. Wang et al. [13] analyzed the air leakage factors in the tunnel area using a fluid-solid coupling model, discussed the influence of pumping time, seal length, and air leakage on gas concentration, and verified them with wellbore environmental parameters measurement equipment. The proposed combined bag-type segmented grouting technology injects different sealing materials into different stress areas to block the leakage channels of coal. Zhang et al. [14] proposed a new method to determine the reasonable sealing depth and studied the geological conditions of coal seams by monitoring roadways’ response while drilling. Numerical simulation and simplified theoretical analysis of the gas drainage process with different sealing depths were studied to understand the path of air from outside to the borehole. Nowadays, the method to solve air leakage in the roadway’s pressure relief zone has been relatively perfect, and the broken drilled zone becomes the main channel for air leakage. It is best to use a sealing material with strong fluidity and permeability to seal the broken drilling area [15]. Therefore, cement-based materials are favored by researchers due to the advantages of strong fluidity, high strength, and density. Ni et al. [16] chose nano-silica, sodium silicate, and styrene-acrylic emulsion to modify the cement and enhance the material’s sealing performance by optimizing the pore structure. Jiang et al. [17] developed a water glass-based concrete sealant using sodium silicate, deionized water, and surfactant. Using super active fluorocarbon surfactants to significantly reduce the surface tension of the material, change the gelation time of the material, and improve the material’s impermeability. Zheng et al. [18] produced a cement-based capillary crystalline material, using Penetero admixture (PA) to improve the sealing performance of the material, and studied the effects of PA on the viscosity, setting time, setting rate, permeability, and compressive strength of cement slurry. However, cement materials have the disadvantage of shrinkage and cracking, which leads to a shortening of the sufficient sealing length [19]. Expansion agent is a useful cement anti-cracking admixture. It can enhance the penetration and sealing ability of the material. Adding expansion agent to the material is an essential technical means to solve the shrinkage and cracking problem of cement-based engineering [20,21]. Therefore, researchers have done a lot of research work. García Calvo et al. [22] evaluated the effectiveness of three expansion agents for concrete expansion materials. They found that the use of expansion cement for sealing can achieve good mechanical adhesion between the sealing material and the surroundings. Karla et al. [23] used expanded glass, broken glass, and glass bead aggregates as expansion components to make expansion materials. The low absorption capacity of glass enhanced the dimensional stability of the mixture, and the finer glass particles in the slurry brought benefits to the expansion of cement. However, the expansion time was not controlled in the humid environment of the coal mine. Zhai et al. [24] developed a composite sealing material composed of expansion agent, additives, fibrin, and coupling agent. The invention has a low raw material cost, comprehensive source, and excellent expansion performance, but the material strength decreases significantly. However, one thing that needs to be explained is that material expansion will cause a decrease mechanical strength and increase porosity, thereby affecting the sealing effect of the material [25]. To achieve the coordinated development of the expansion and performance, and rationally use the expansion energy, consider using microcapsules to wrap the expansion agent. By delaying the expansion, the expansion agent reacts with hydrate after the material reaches sufficient strength, reducing its influence on the material structure and pores. Microcapsule technology improves the properties (such as morphology, solubility), reactivity, and durability of the wrapped core material [26,27]. Water will gradually penetrate microcapsules under osmotic pressure. When the hydration product breaks through the microcapsule wall, the microcapsule expansion components will enter the cement hydration environment. Therefore, the core material’s release speed can be controlled by adjusting the thickness of the wall material (core-to-wall ratio) [28]. As the wall-to-core ratio increases, the rate of water entering the microcapsules decreases, the wall material is not easily broken, and the delay expansion time increases. In this paper, the authors use polyvinyl alcohol as wall material and aluminum powder as core material to make microcapsule expansion agent. The influence of delayed expansion on mechanical strength, porosity, and pore connectivity of sealing material is analyzed by uniaxial compression and NMR experiment combined with fractal dimension and material volume. The results show that delayed expansion can reduce the adverse effects of expansion agents, which provides a theoretical basis for developing high-strength, high-density expansion sealing materials. The research is of great significance to the development of high-efficiency delayed expansion drilling sealing materials."
1,Sample preparation and experimental methods,
2,Preparation of microcapsules,"2.1 Preparation of microcapsules The production process of microcapsules is as follows. First, fix the beaker in a constant temperature water bath, add 100 mL of water to the beaker, weigh the polyvinyl alcohol into the water according to the core wall ratio and the number of microcapsules configured. Adjust the water bath temperature to 80 °C, stir for 30 min, and rotate at 500 r/min to completely dissolve it. Then add the expansion agent in proportion and continue to stir until the water evaporation is completed. Place the microcapsules in a drying oven, adjust the temperature to 60 °C, and dry for 12 h. Use a disintegrator to grind the microcapsules into powder. A total of five kinds of microcapsules are produced, with wall-core ratios of 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2."
3,Production of sealing materials,"2.2 Production of sealing materials The experimental process is shown in Fig. 1 . The water-cement ratio is 0.45, and the polycarboxylate water reducer is 1%. Mix the cement with water, stir for 15 min, add the expansion agent, stir for 5 min, and put the slurry in a 50∗100 cylindrical mold. Shake it for 1 min using a shaking table. After two days, remove the mold and place it in a standard environment with a temperature of 20 ± 2 °C and a relative humidity ≥95% for 28 days. Several sealing materials containing different proportions of expansion agent and microcapsules are produced."
4,Expansion rate test,"2.3 Expansion rate test The Le Chatelier rubber band method is used to test the expansion rate of the material. First, the cement slurry is quickly injected into the rubber balloon with a glass funnel. Then put it in a wide-mouth bottle filled with water, seal the bottle with a rubber stopper with a pipette, read the liquid level scale, and record it as the initial measurement value, then record it every 10 min. The expansion rate K at a certain moment is: K = S t − S 0 V 0 Where, St is the scale of the glass tube at the current moment; S0 is the initial scale of the glass tube page; V0 is the initial volume of cement slurry."
5,NMR text,"2.4 NMR text NMR measures the relaxation characteristics of the hydrogen-containing fluid in the pores to invert the T 2 distribution of relaxation time to characterize the pore size, shape, and pore size distribution of the material. NMR can measure the full-size pore size range pores without damaging the material specimen during the test. The experimental method is as follows. First, measure the test piece’s size and quality, then placed it in a vacuum water saturation device, immersed in a vacuum pressure of −0.1 MPa for 12 h, and tested using a low field nuclear magnetic resonance analyzer. Centrifuge the material for 15 min to test the experimental data of the centrifuge. The T 2 curve, NMR porosity, cumulative porosity curve and T 2 cut-off time T 2c value of saturated water and centrifugal state are obtained. NMR experiment uses the MesoMR low-field NMR analyzer produced by Suzhou Newmarket Analytical Instruments company, with a main magnetic field strength of 0.5 ± 0.05 T, a main frequency of 21.3 MHz, a radio frequency power of 300 W, and a magnet uniformity of 12.0 × 10–6.

7,Results and discussion,
8,The effect of expansion agent and microcapsule on the volume of the material,"3.1 The effect of expansion agent and microcapsule on the volume of the material Adding expansion agents to compensate for shrinkage deformation is one of the fundamental ways to solve cement-based materials cracking. The relationship between the expansion agent and the material expansion rate is shown in Fig. 2 . Material with a water-cement ratio of 0.45 has a volume reduction of 0.52% after setting. When the amount of expansion agent is less than 0.08%, the expansion ratio is linear with the amount of expansion agent. After adding more than 0.08%, the curve slope decreases, and the expansion rate reaches the maximum at 0.15%. Later, as the expansion agent increased, the expansion rate of the material began to decline. A small amount of H2 can be evenly dispersed into the cement slurry, but as the expansion agent increases, the gas escapes from the slurry. When the expansion agent exceeds 0.15%, the gas will penetrate the slurry’s internal connection, which cannot be stably dispersed in the cement slurry. And the expansion rate will become smaller as the expansion agent increases. The material structure is destroyed, so the expansion rate is reduced due to the expansion agent’s increase. Table 1 shows the effect of different doses of MEA (the wall-core ratio is 0.6) on the material’s volume. At the same dosage, the expansion rate of MEA decreased by 0.46%, 0.44%, 0.89%, 0.91%, 1.34% compared with ordinary expansion agent (OEA), with an average decrease of 17.31%. Fig. 3 shows the effect of different wall-core ratios on material volume changes. As the wall-core ratio increases, the capsule wall’s resistance to water increases, and the rate of water penetration into the microcapsule decreases. Besides, as the thickness of the capsule wall increases, the microcapsules are more difficult to rupture. The contact time between the expansion agent and hydrate is further delayed, which ultimately leads to an increase in the inhibitory effect of polyvinyl alcohol on the expansion agent."
9,The effect of microcapsule expansion agent on the physical strength of the material,"3.2 The effect of microcapsule expansion agent on the physical strength of the material The material’s stress-strain curve is shown in Fig. 4 . 0# is pure cement material, 1# to 5# are sealing materials with OEA, 1∗ to 5∗ are sealing materials with MEA, and the wall-core ratio is 0.6. The proportion of the added expansion agent is 0.005%, 0.01%, 0.015%, 0.02%, and 0.025%. According to the curve change, it is divided into four stages, of which the OA stage is the initial loading stage, the AB stage is the elastic stage, the BC stage is the failure stage, and the breaking stage after point C [26]. In the OA section, original large cracks are closed under the force, and a small number of new cracks are born in the material. In the elastic phase, racks inside the material begin to propagate steadily. The load increase leads to an increase of internal cracks, and the location spreads from the middle to the surrounding parts. The damaged area of the material increases, but it still does not exceed the withstand limit. BC is the stage of unsteady propagation of cracks. At this stage, the number of cracks increased rapidly. Inclined cracks and horizontal cracks began to appear, and a crack network is gradually formed inside the material. The damage to the material has affected its overall bearing capacity. Material strength reaches the peak stress at point C, and volume expansion of the material leads to a change in its structure and decreased strength. Compared with ordinary sealing materials, the peak stress of 1# to 5# has decreased by 36.69%, 50.72%, 53.60%, 63.93%, and 66.86%. After using MEA, the material’s strength is increased, and the peak stress of microcapsule material (the wall-core ratio is 0.6) increases by 16.24% on average compared with ordinary expansion material. Volume expansion caused by the same proportion of MEA is less than that of OEA. Furthermore, when MEA expands, the cement has sufficient strength, and the resulting expansion is difficult to break through the blockade of hydrates, causing large-scale structural damage. Since the volume change of material is not easy to control, it is difficult to manufacture two materials with the same expansion volume for comparison, so consider establishing the relationship between volume change and strength. As shown in Fig. 5 , the red line and blue line are the fitting curves of the expansion rate and peak stress of ordinary expansion materials and microcapsule materials [33,34]. The fitting can get the line’s slope, which indicates the magnitude of change in the strength with volume. So, it can be used for the analysis of material parameters. The two fitting lines’ R-squared is 0.9451 and 0.9082, which shows a high degree of fit. The slope of the former is 0.9931, which is greater than the latter’s 0.8925. Therefore, with the same volume change, the microcapsule material’s peak stress is higher than those of ordinary expanded materials, the performance is more superior. Table 2 shows four types of microcapsule materials with different wall-core ratios. As the thickness of the capsule wall increases, microcapsules are more difficult to rupture, and the inhibitory effect of polyvinyl alcohol on the expansion agent is enhanced. When the expansion agent is released, the material structure is stable and harder to break. Microcapsule material’s peak stress is increased by 9.34%, 12.96%, 17.03%, and 23.13% compared with that of ordinary expansion sealing material. After point C, obvious longitudinal cracks appear on the material’s surface, and the material loses structural integrity. The subsequent deformation is mainly the slippage between the fragments and the further fragmentation of some fragments; the resistance mainly comes from the friction and mechanical bite between the fragments. Throughout the entire destruction process of cement-based materials, it is a process in which axial force works on materials. Mechanical energy is converted into internal energy, and then energy is finally released."
10,Exploring the effect of microcapsule expansion agent on material pores based on NMR,"3.3 Exploring the effect of microcapsule expansion agent on material pores based on NMR Fig. 6 shows the T 2 spectrum of the saturated water of the sealing material. The lateral relaxation time is divided into three relaxation peaks in the attenuation range. Since the attenuation constant is proportional to the pore size, the three relaxation peaks from left to right are micropores, mesopores, and macropores. The T 2 peak location is related to the pore size, and the area of the peak is related to the number of corresponding pores [27,28]. The results show that ordinary materials are mainly micropores and mesopores. After adding the expansion agent, the relaxation peaks representing mesopores and macropores are enhanced. An increase in the amplitude of T 2 indicates that the number of pores increases, and the lateral relaxation time range becomes wider and moves to the right, indicating that pores with larger pore diameters are generated. With the increase of the proportion of expansion agent, the shape of the T 2 peak gradually becomes smooth. It has good continuity, which shows that the expansion agent destroys the material structure, accelerates the formation of cracks, and increases the pores’ connectivity. The material added with MEA has decreased the area and height of the peaks representing mesopores and macropores under the same volume change compared with OEA. The connectivity of the material decreases. Calculate the T 2 spectrum to obtain the porosity of the material. The T 2 spectrum of the material in saturated water is calculated to obtain the specimen’s total porosity. The same method can be used to calculate the residual porosity in the centrifugal state, and the difference is the effective porosity [29]. The calculation method is as follows. Where， ϕ N , ϕ N B , ϕ N F represent total porosity, residual porosity, and effective porosity, respectively; BVI represents the area of the T 2 spectrum in the state where the weight is no longer reduced after centrifugation; FFI represents the free fluid index; BVI + FFI represents the area of the T 2 spectrum in the saturated water state. BVI and FFI are related to bound water and free water, respectively. The bound water corresponds to the adsorption hole that is not easy to drain, and the free water corresponds to the seepage hole [30]. Therefore, BVI and FFI can indicate the proportion of the percolation holes and the adsorption holes in the total pores. (1) ϕ N B = ϕ N × B V I B V I + F F I (2) ϕ N F = ϕ N × F F I B V I + F F I As shown in Fig. 7 , the material’s porosity component and cumulative porosity are calculated, where 0# is pure cement material, and the proportion of OEA in 1# to 5# is 0.005%, 0.01, 0.015%, 0.02%, and 0.025%. The total porosity of 0# is 3.77%. With the increase of the OEA, the density of the material decreases, and the porosity increases. The porosity of 1# to 5# is 4.25%, 4.21%, 4.47%, 4.61% and 4.68%, has increased by 12.54%, 11.35%, 18.25%, 22.16% and 23.79%. The expanding agent will not only increase the number of pores but also change the pore distribution. The proportion of bound fluid space is reduced, and free fluid space is increased. Macroscopically, the pores inside the material develop and grow, and the difficulty of gas passing through the material is reduced. As the expansion agent increases, the proportion of seepage pores increases from 37.29% to 51.39%, and seepage pores 1# to 5# increases by 0.01%, 10.28%, 9.95%, 13.98%, and 14.11%. Pores change from micropores to macropores. T 2 cutoff value is a relaxation time threshold that divides the T 2 map into bound water and free water. This value’s size can also reflect the number distribution relationship between the adsorption pores and the seepage pores. This value is positively correlated with the number range of adsorption pores and negatively correlated with seepage pores. The calculation method of T 2 cutoff value is shown in Fig. 7. This value is mainly used to calculate the fractal dimension of material pores. Compared with 0#, the T 2 cutoff value of 1# to 5# moves to the coordinate axis’s right, which is in agreement with the conclusion obtained above. Due to the expansion of MEA under the condition that cement has sufficient strength, the resulting expansion product is challenging to break through the blockade of hydration products, causing large-scale structural damage, resulting in cross-connections between pores. Therefore, 1∗ to 5∗ have a reduced porosity compared to ordinary materials. The porosity decreased by 1.18%, 0.04%, 1.13%, 3.63%, 2.41%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 8 , red is the fitting curve of the expansion ratio and porosity of the ordinary expansion material, and blue is the microcapsule material. The fit of the two straight lines is 0.9237 and 0.9271. The slope of the former is 0.067, which is greater than 0.056 of the latter. That is, with same volume expansion, the porosity of the microcapsule material is reduced less than that of the ordinary expanded material, and the material is denser. Different wall-core ratios have different effects on the expansion agent. Fig. 9 shows the effect of the wall-core ratio on the material’s porosity. The addition amount of the expansion agent is 0.015%. As the thickness of the capsule wall increases, the difficulty in releasing the expansion agent increases, and the inhibitory effect of polyvinyl alcohol on the expansion agent increases. Compared with ordinary expanded materials, the material’s porosity has decreased by 1.13%, 2.05%, 5.11%, and 5.82%. And due to the weakening of structural damage, the proportion of adsorption pores increased, and the proportion of seepage holes decreased. Seepage holes of the four materials decreased by 0.47%, 1.49%, 3.03%, and 8.48%."
11,Exploring the influence of microcapsules on pore connectivity based on fractal dimension,"3.4 Exploring the influence of microcapsules on pore connectivity based on fractal dimension 3.4.1 Fractal dimension calculation Fig. 10 shows the fractal dimension characteristics of materials calculated in different forms based on NMR spectra. The test materials are the same as 3.2. It can be seen from the natural logarithmic relationship between Sv and T 2 that the trend line of the relationship curve can be divided into two segments. Because T 2C is the boundary between free water pores and bound water pores in the material, the material pores are divided into adsorption pores and seepage pores [31]. The fractal dimensions based on the adsorption pore and the seepage pore are calculated using T 2C as the dividing point. In this way, according to the state of water in the material, the experimental material’s fractal dimension is divided into D w based on the saturated water state, D a based on the bound water state, and Ds based on the free water state. According to the fractal dimension theory, the pore structure’s fractal dimension in the material is meaningful only between 2–3 [32]. The value of fractal dimension D a (0.0189–0.5554) based on the adsorption pores in the material is less than 2, so it does not have fractal characteristics. Therefore, this article will not discuss the fractal dimension based on the adsorption pores. In Fig. 10, the material is based on the total pore fractal dimension D w (2.6119–2.6748), with an average value of 2.6418, and the seepage pore fractal dimension Ds (2.9701–2.9176), with an average value of 2.9402. Both fractal dimension values are between 2–3, so they conform to the fractal dimension characteristics. The correlation coefficients of linear fitting based on the fractal dimension of seepage pores (0.6873–0.9445) are larger than the total pore fractal dimensions (0.4141–0.4774), indicating that the pore distribution of seepage pores has more fractal characteristics. Fig. 11 shows the relationship between the fractal dimensions D w , Ds and the amount of expansion agent. The fractal dimension can characterize the complexity of the pore structure and the ability to adsorb gas. The closer the fractal dimension is to 2, the weaker the anisotropy, the more uniform the pore structure, and the better the connectivity between the pores. Conversely, the closer the fractal dimension is to 3, the more complex the material’s pore structure. D w and Ds are negatively correlated with the content of the expansion agent. As the expansion agent increases, the fractal dimension gradually decreases, indicating that the pore structure becomes uniform and the pore channel’s connectivity is enhanced, which is beneficial to the passage of gas. Compared with ordinary expansion materials, the fractal dimension D w and Ds of microcapsule materials are increased. The main reason is that the expansion agent’s expansion effect is suppressed by polyvinyl alcohol, and the expansion factor decreases. However, under the same expansion rate, D w and Ds of the microcapsule materials are higher than those of ordinary expansion materials. Table 3 shows the fractal dimension of microcapsule materials with different wall-core ratios (addition amount is 0.015%), and the wall-core ratios are 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2. The material’s expansion ratio with a wall-core of 1.0 is 7.92% higher than that of 2#, but the fractal dimensions D w and Ds of the two materials are basically the same. It shows that the pore structure of the microcapsule material is more complicated at the same expansion rate. The pores’ connectivity is worse, and the sealing effect is better. Comparing the data in Table 3, the greater the wall-core ratio, the better the microcapsules’ delay effect, and the smaller the structure’s damage, so the fractal dimensions D w and Ds increase. 3.4.2 Relationship between material porosity, expansion ratio, peak stress and fractal dimension Fig. 12 shows that the fractal dimension is negatively correlated with the porosity. As the fractal dimension increases, the pore’s specific surface area increases, and the pore distribution becomes more complicated. In the material, the micropores related to the adsorption pores occupy a larger proportion of the surface, increasing the complexity of the pore distribution, while the larger pores and fissures are reducing the specific surface area and the complexity of the pore distribution. As the expansion agent increases, the total porosity of the material increases, the proportion of seepage pores increases, and the adsorption pores decrease, thereby reducing the pore distribution’s complexity and making the fractal dimensions D w and Ds both decreases. The increase in seepage porosity reduces the specific surface area and fractal dimension of the material, resulting in a negative correlation between porosity and fractal dimension. It can be seen from Fig. 13 that the expansion rate is negatively correlated with the fractal dimensions Ds and D w , and the peak stress is linearly correlated with the fractal dimensions. As the expansion rate increases, the connection between the aggregate and the binder within the material weakens. The pores’ complexity decreases, and the connectivity increases, leading to a reduction in the fractal dimension. Because the number of cracks in the material increases and the structure is destroyed, when the external force is applied, the crack development source increases, and the material’s peak stress decreases."
12,Conclusion,"In order to reduce the influence of the expansion agent on the structure and pores of the sealing material and achieve the coordinated development of expansion and performance, the expansion agent is processed by microcapsule technology to produce delayed expansion drilling sealing material. The influence of delayed expansion on mechanical strength, porosity, and pore connectivity of sealing material is analyzed by uniaxial compression and NMR experiment combined with fractal dimension and material volume. The experiment proved the feasibility of delaying expansion to reduce the negative influence of expansion agent. The main conclusions of the paper are as follows: (1) The expansion rate is positively related to the amount of expansion agent. As the proportion increases, the curve’s growth rate slows down and reaches a peak at 0.15%, with a maximum expansion rate of 77.46%. Then the volume of decreases as the expansion agent increases. (2) The slope of the curve between the expansion rate and peak stress, porosity of ordinary expansion materials is 0.9931 and 0.0672, which is greater than 0.8925 and 0.0563 of microcapsule materials. Therefore, with the same volume change, the microcapsule materials’ peak stress and porosity are higher than those of ordinary expanded materials. The larger the wall-core ratio, the better the effect of microcapsules. (3) The porosity increases with the expansion rate. Adding 0.025% expansion agent to cement increases the porosity by 23.79%, and the proportion of seepage pores increases from 37.29% to 51.39%. (4) Fractal dimension is negatively correlated with porosity and expansion rate, and positively correlated with peak stress. At the same expansion rate, the fractal dimensions D w and Ds of the microcapsule material are higher than those of the ordinary expansion material. Microcapsule expansion agent reacts with hydrate under the condition that cement has sufficient strength to avoid the increase of porosity and decrease of peak stress due to large-scale structural damage, which helps realize the coordinated development of expansion and performance. The research is of great significance to developing high-efficiency drilling sealing materials. It provides a theoretical basis for the subsequent development of high-strength, high-density delayed expansion sealing materials."
