0,Introduction,"Rapid industrial development, urbanisation and population growth have contributed to water scarcity, due to their adverse effects on water quality. Less than 1% freshwater is available for terrestrial and aquatic biota, ecosystems, and human life that depends on it (Tran et al., 2013). The presence of Algae affects water quality by producing foul odour and taste and releasing algal toxins. In water treatment processes, it results in clogging of water intake screens and increasing coagulant and disinfection chemical demand. Disinfection methods used in wastewater treatment are physical methods which use ultraviolet radiation and membrane filtration. Chemical methods use chlorine, chloramine, chlorine dioxide, ozone, hydrogen peroxide etc. which act as oxidising disinfectants. These water treatment processes are costly and generally cumbersome (Garus-Oas, 2017). Namibia is a semi-arid country in Southern Africa, where human-made dams and water reservoirs play an essential role in providing the potable water. Windhoek, the capital city of Namibia, holds the largest population and typically relies on three sources of water for drinking water, i.e. groundwater (23%), surface water (56%) and recycled water (21%) (Biggs and Williams, 2001). The Namibia Water Corporation (Namwater) is a bulk potable water distributor and relies on an integrated three-dam system (Von Bach Dam, Swakopport Dam and Omatako Dam) to supply treated water to Windhoek and neighbouring towns. These dams are however periodically polluted by algal blooms which were revealed in a study conducted by (Garus-Oas et al., 2017), where abundant algae were identified as Cyanobacteria such as Cyanophyceae, Chlorophyta such as Chlorophyceae and Bacillariophyta such as Aulacoseira. Cyanobacteria such as Microcystin and Anabaena were identified in a study reported by (Sirunda, 2011). Cyanobacteria impacts on water quality in dam water as they are known to produce toxins, foul taste and odour (New Era Reporter, 2016). Nanotechnology is an emerging field with applications in various areas, such as manufacturing, medicine and healthcare, energy, engineering, electronics, and information technology industries (Roy and Das, 2015). Hence nanoparticles have been fabricated by different methods such as physical, chemical and biological methods. However, the physical and chemical processes are time-consuming and pose an environmental threat; the natural process of synthesis is thus preferred (Prathna et al., 2011). Hence, several methods have been reported for the biosynthesis of NPs from the corresponding metal salts at room temperature within a few seconds to minutes. Easy to scale up is the use of plant extract as they are effortless, simple, rapid, energy-conserving, contamination-free, eco-friendly and economical. Hence plant extract acts both as reducing and stabilising agent in the synthesis of nanoparticles. The potential activity of the plant extract varies with the nature of the plant as each vegetation has a different composition and concentration the organic components in the reducing extract (Prathna et al., 2011). Furthermore, Ag-NPs exhibit broad-spectrum bactericidal and fungicidal activity (Tran et al., 2013). In the top to bottom approach the size of the silver metallic particles in its bulk form reduces mechanically to the nano-scale by using physical methods such as evaporation-condensation, laser ablation, ball milling and chemical etching (Mohammadlou et al., 2016). The bottom to top approach is a self-assembly technique and includes dissolution of silver salt into a solvent, reduction of silver ions to their element using the addition of a reducing agent and then stabilisation of the forming Ag-NPs using a stabilising agent to prevent agglomeration of nanoparticles (Mohammadlou et al., 2016). Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) have attracted particular attention due to their unique characteristics such as size and their distinct optical, biological, electronic, physical, chemical, thermal conductivity, surface-enhanced Raman scattering, chemical stability, catalytic activity, consistent crystal structure. nonlinear optical behaviour and biological properties as compared to other noble metal counterparts which depend on their shapes (nanotubes, nanowires, nanoporous solids) (Zhang et al., 2016; Sarvanan et al., 2008; Roy and Das, 2015). From literature, it is evident that there are many biosynthesis methods reported for the synthesis of Ag NPs prepared from Sorghum Bran (Njagi et al., 2010), Banana peel, Aloe vera, Tansy fruit (Chauhan and Upadhyay, 2012), and other biomaterials (Loo et al., 2012). (Reenal and Iruthaya, 2015) reported a green synthesis method for AgNPs using Oryza Sativa husk extracted by hot water extraction (HWE) process. Further (Leiu Y. S. et al., 2018) reported that the extraction rate for phenolic acids from plants was inadequate by HWE, since most phenolic acids collective with lignin resulted in esterified form (Irakli et al., 2012; Formica-Oliveira et al., 2017). (Leiu Y. S. et al., 2018) reported the synthesis of Ag NPs using Rice husks at 115 °C under high-pressure reactor. However, these methods require the use of high temperature and pressure, lengthy procedures, hot water extraction. Hence, author's have developed a new simple method for the synthesis of AgNPs using Rice Husk Glaucumm. This was achieved by grinding the Rice Husk Glaucumm and cooling for overnight, via a single step, at room temperature, followed by the reduction of silver ions using Rice husk aqueous solution resulting in stable colloids affording Ag-NPs. In this research article silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) were synthesised by biological route using Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) a drought-resistant grain locally grown in Namibia and popularly known as “Mahangu” (Dirkx et al., 2008). Ag-NPs have been reported to possess unique antimicrobial and catalytic properties (Bhosale and Bhanage. 2015), and for this study, the antimicrobial properties were exploited in wastewater treatment for algae control. Literature reports confirm that the nano-sized silver particles contribute to a strong antimicrobial effect because of the high specific surface area (Karumuri et al., 2013). The antimicrobial effect is shown by minerals such as mercury, silver, copper, lead, zinc, gold and aluminium, among other metals (Jain, 1990). However, it has been hypothesised that the metal ions denature enzymes of the target cell or organism by binding to reactive groups, resulting in their precipitation and inactivation (Shrestha et al., 2010). Silver has the most effective antimicrobial action and is least toxic to animal cells (Charles.F.McKhann et al., 1948; Ahmed et al., 2016) and the application of Ag-NPs for the control and inhibition of algae growth. The control and management of algal blooms are essential. Hence Ag NPs have been applied as a disinfectant in wastewater treatment Prolonged use of commercial disinfectants has led to the development of resistance by some pathogens such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium (Prathna et al., 2018). Unlike commercial disinfectants, nanoparticles do not generate harmful DBPs as they are not strong oxidants and are relatively inert. Due to the antimicrobial nature of silver as discussed above and Ag-NPs can be applied in water treatment for disinfection purposes (Prathna et al., 2018). The antimicrobial effect of Ag-NPs is based on the continuous release of silver ions. However, compared with Titanium dioxide, that requires energy, consuming UV light for activation, Ag-NPs kill bacteria with no need for additional energy. This makes Ag-NPs a favourable disinfectant (Gehrke & Somborn-schulz, 2015). Studies on the toxicity of Ag-NPs against microorganisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been reported (Ibrahim, 2015). These studies have revealed that Ag-NPs can be used as an effective disinfectant in water treatment. They utilised the Ag-NPs for point-of-use water disinfection systems and anti-biofouling surfaces (Fewtrell, 2014). Several noble metals such as platinum, titanium, gold, ruthenium and palladium nanoparticle catalysts have been reported in the literature with regard to the conversion of alcohols to aldehydes (Khan et al., 2015 and Adil S. F et al., 2013). However, research on Ag-NPs prepared from Pearl Millet (Pennisetum Glaucum) husk, and Ag-NPs doped charcoal-based catalysts for oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde hasn't been reported. A novel protocol is developed for the first time using Pearl millet (Pennisetum Glaucum) husk for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) by a biological method for use in the treatment of algae found in the waste water. Further, we investigated the catalytic property of Ag-NPs doped on charcoal for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. The oxidation of aromatic alcohols to corresponding aldehydes is a vital value-added transformation, as they play a significant role as building blocks for many organic compounds (Hemalatha et al., 2013). The novel concept of cleaner production was introduced to control the algal growth in water sources which will, in turn, help water-stressed nations like Namibia (Likela S. 2019). There are no literature reports on the use of AgNPs and AgNPs doped charcoal to treat the wastewaters (Khan. et al, 2015)."

7,Preparation of extract,"2.6 Preparation of extract 1 g of pearl millet husks were boiled for approximately 30 min in distilled water. Water was used as a solvent due to its high polarity, low toxicity and would not result in the dissociation of biomolecules present in the extract (Interchim Inc. 2016). The extract was cooled and filtered through a Whatman No.1 filter paper and stored at 4 °C for 12 h duration."
8,Synthesis of silver nanoparticles,"2.7 Synthesis of silver nanoparticles The source of silver was aqueous silver nitrate (AgNO3) purchased from Sigma Aldrich. A typical reaction mixture contained Pearl Millet Extract (PME) with AgNO3 solution. The synthesis was carried out in the dark to avoid the photo-activation of AgNO3. The effect of PME (30–50 ml) and AgNO3 concentration (1.0–3.0 Mm), pH (4–12), time (4 h-20 min) and temperature (25 °C–100 °C) parameters were studied to determine optimum conditions for Ag-NP synthesis. A sample containing AgNO3 only was used as a control for each experiment."
9,Characterisation of synthesised silver nanoparticles,"The Ag-NPs synthesised at optimum conditions were characterised by various techniques. Primary identification of the formation of Ag-NPs was made using a Perkin Elmar Lambda 35 UV–Vis spectrophotometer. A JEOL JSM-6100 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was used to study the morphology and surface topography of the Ag-NPs. A JEOL JEM-1010 Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) was used to know the topography, particle size and dispersion of nanoparticles. To determine the functional groups of the PME and their possible involvement in the synthesis of Ag-NPs, Fourier Transform Infra-red (FTIR) analysis was carried out using an FT-IR Perkin Elmar Spectrum 2 Spectrometer."
10,Antimicrobial activity of Ag-NPs on algae,"3.1 Antimicrobial activity of Ag-NPs on algae We collected the Algal samples were from the Von Bach Dam and Swakop River using a convenience non-probability sampling technique. Algae was subjected to varying concentrations (2.25 mM; 3.0 mM; 3.75 mM and 4.5 mM) of Ag-NPs to determine antimicrobial effectiveness. 20 ml of algae source water was added to each sample, and the samples were exposed to sunlight to allow normal photosynthetic processes to occur. The samples were exposed to Ag-NPs for 7 days. The algal sample without Ag-NP addition was taken as a control. Periodically, aliquots from algal suspensions were withdrawn for measuring the chlorophyll concentration. PerkinElmer Lambda 35 UV–Vis Spectrophotometer was used for chlorophyll measurements. The algae genus was identified using a Biomed Light Microscope. The morphology of algae exposed to Ag-NPs was assessed through a light microscope."
11,Catalytic activity of silver nanoparticles,"3.2 Catalytic activity of silver nanoparticles 3.2.1 Catalyst preparation The catalyst was prepared by doping 5 g of powdered charcoal with 50 ml of Ag-NP solution. The solution was stirred using a magnetic stirrer for 20 min at 25 °C (room temperature) then filtered using a Buchner funnel under vacuum. The resultant Ag-NP doped charcoal was dried at 70 °C and calcined at 400 °C for 4 h in a furnace. 3.2.2 Reaction procedure for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol A typical reaction mixture contained 30% hydrogen peroxide, 2 mM benzyl alcohol, 15 ml Acetonitrile solvent (obtained from Merck Chemicals) and 0.3 g Ag-NP doped charcoal catalyst in a round-bottomed flask, and refluxed at 80 °C. The reaction was monitored by Thin Layer Chromatography until its completion. The reaction mixture was filtered through Buchner funnel, and the filtrate was analysed by an HPLC instrument. 3.2.3 Extraction of the crude reaction mixture After completion of the reaction, the Ag-NPs catalyst was separated from the crude reaction mixture by filtration. The crude reaction mixture was washed by adding 10 ml of distilled water, followed by extraction using 20 ml of ethyl acetate. Then the water layer was discarded. 1 g of magnesium sulphate was added to the organic layer. The organic product containing the solvent was evaporated in a rotary evaporator to afford the crude product (Roy et al., 2015). There are no sources in the current document. 3.2.4 Analysis of the crude reaction mixture The organic product was analysed by PerkinElmer Flexar High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) equipped with a 200 UV–Vis detector, kinetic C18 column, column length - 250 mm, and diameter - 4μmm, packed with 5.0 μm particles. Pure benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol were analysed as standards, and their retention times matched well with the reactant and product from the reaction."
12,Results and discussion,
13,Absorption spectra of Ag-NPs using UV–Vis Spectroscopy,"4.1 Absorption spectra of Ag-NPs using UV–Vis Spectroscopy UV–Vis Spectroscopy was the principal method used for the identification of the formation of Ag-NPs. Upon the formation of Ag-NPs, colours orange to dark brown were observed, as shown in Fig. 1 . The colours were due to the unique optical properties of noble metals known as Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)."
14,Analysis of silver nanoparticles by UV spectroscopy,"4.2 Analysis of silver nanoparticles by UV spectroscopy Formation of Ag-NPs was visually observed by colour formation. The colour formation was due to the unique optical property of Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) of silver which was watched by peak formation using UV–Vis spectrometry. The SPR peak arises due to a strong interaction of the Ag-NPs with light, and this results in electrons on the metal surface to undergo a collective oscillation when excited by light at specific wavelengths (Oldenburg, 2017). The SPR peak was observed at various wavelengths in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and this influences the shape of the nanoparticles. Fig. 2 represents the UV–Vis spectrum of Ag-NPs formed at optimum conditions of synthesis. The SPR peak was at a wavelength of 429 nm."
15,Standardisation of Ag-NP synthesis,"The effect of different parameters, namely pH, Pearl Millet extract, AgNO3 concentration, temperature and time, on the formation of Ag NPs formation, was studied. i) Effect of pH The reduction of silver ions to form Ag-NPs was dependent on the pH of the reaction mixture. As shown in Supplementary Figure 6a, the reaction mixture exhibited a gradual change from colourless to brown with an increase in pH, suggesting that pH increase facilitate the formation of Ag-NPs. At pH 4.0, there was no absorption peak, and peak was observed from pH 6 onwards. Absorption peak sharpened with pH continually; however, pH 12, registered lower absorbance suggesting reduced nanoparticle formation at very high alkaline pH. With most intense peak, the optimum pH was taken as 10 (Fig. 3 (a)). Generally the metal ion reduction is pH sensitive, and, the alkaline conditions facilitate the deprotonation of functional groups on available biomolecules. The more negatively charged biomolecules become, the more capable they are to attract more Ag+ ions and hence increase the reduction reaction of Ag+ ions to Ag-NPs (Sanghi and Verma, 2009). At pH 4, no peak was observed, but as conditions became more alkaline, peak formation was observed. This, therefore, indicates the necessity of hydroxyl (OH−) ions for reduction reactions to initiate for Ag-NP synthesis (Sanghi and Verma, 2009). ii) Effect of Pearl Millet Extract Fig. 3 (b) illustrates the formation of Ag-NPs was a result of the reduction of AgNO3 by biomolecules available in the PME and effect of their volume. The optimum PME volume was 35 ml. An increase in the concentration of PME did not show an improvement in bio-reduction of Ag + ions to nanoparticles. Formation of nanoparticles was dependent on the AgNO3: PME concentration ratio. PME volume of 45 ml and 50 ml resulted in broad peaks and a low absorbance at lower wavelengths, suggesting a blue-shift from 429 to 380 nm. The blue shift was due to a decrease in the size of the nanoparticles. According to earlier studies, this is indicative of increased capping of nanoparticles with stabilising molecules (Ashraf et al., 2016). Broadening of the peak was related to the size distribution of nanoparticles. Peak broadening indicated a broader range in size or shape of particles, thus giving an overall expansion and associated decrease in the absorbance (Ashraf et al., 2016). iii) Effect of Silver Nitrate Concentration The reaction mixture of AgNO3 and PME showed an increase in the colour intensity of reaction mixtures as the concentration of AgNO3 increased from 1.0 mM to 3.0 mM, as shown in Fig. 3 (c). This shows there was an increase in the formation of Ag-NPs with an increase in AgNO3 concentration. Generally, a variation in biomolecules and metal salt (AgNO3) level influences nanoparticle synthesis. It was observed that when active biomolecule sites were saturated with silver ions. Hence there will be no further increase in the synthesis of Ag-NPs despite the addition of more salt (Prathna et al., 2011a). With silver nitrate concentration 3.5 mM, the UV–Vis spectrum showed signs that aggregation was beginning to occur. When silver nanoparticles aggregate, the metal particles become electronically coupled and have a different SPR peak than the individual particles. In the case of a multi-nanoparticle aggregate, the plasmon resonance will be red-shifted to a longer wavelength than the resonance of a single nanoparticle, and aggregation is observable as an intensity increase in the infrared region of the spectrum as shown in Fig. 3(c) (Oldenburg, 2015). iv) Effect of Temperature Fig. 3 (d) shows the effect of temperature on the synthesis of Ag-NPs. Broad peaks with low absorbance were observed for reaction mixtures at 25 °C and 50 °C, with SPR peaks at 400 nm. The broadening of the peaks was due to uniform particle size distribution, as explained in section ii. The SPR peaks became sharper with an increase in temperature indicating the formation of uniformly sized nanoparticles. The colour intensity of the Ag-NPs reaction mixture also increased with increase in temperature from a pale brown to a very dark brown solution. The increase in the absorbance and colour intensity with an increase in temperature showed the dependence of the silver ion reduction on the reaction temperature. Upon an increase in temperature (from 50 °C–100 °C), a red-shift appeared from 400 nm to 424 nm, indicating an increase in Ag-NPs size (Amin et al., 2012). As the reaction temperature increased, the reaction rate also increased, causing most Ag+ ions to be consumed in the formation of nuclei and thus stopping the secondary reduction process on the surface of the pre-formed nuclei. Increasing the temperature beyond a certain point aids the growth of the crystal around the nucleus; thus, the observed increase in particle size (Sun et al., 2003). The temperature was not further increased above 100 °C as nanoparticle aggregation was beginning to occur as shown by the increase in intensity in the infrared region of the spectrum as shown in Fig. 3(d). v) Effect of time Fig. 3 (e) shows the effect of time on Ag-NP synthesis. It was observed that as the time progressed the SPR peak absorbance increased, this suggested continual formation of Ag-NPs with time. However, it was found that after 3 h, the SPR peak decreased in absorbance and broadening occurred. The colour intensity also changed with an increase in time from pale brown to dark brown. Peak broadening was a result of a broader range in size and shape of particles with an increase in time. The change in particle size was a result of particle agglomeration nature of nanoparticles with an increase in time (Sanghi, 2009)."
16,FT-IR analysis,"FT-IR analysis was performed to determine functional groups responsible for the reduction of Ag+ ions to Ag-NPs and stabilisation by the plant extract as a reducing and stabilising or capping agent. Fig. 6 shows a comparison between the Pearl Millet husk (control) spectra and the Ag-NPs spectra. There was a shift in the following peaks: 3692 -3713 cm−1; 2972–2982 cm−1; 2862 -2868 cm−1; 2320 -2330 cm−1; 1350 -1359 cm−1 and 1013 -1033 cm−1. The shift in the peaks indicated the involvement of the functional groups in the Ag-NP synthesis. The peak shift at 3692 cm−1was due to N–H stretching of amides or the O–H stretching vibrations of alcohols. The peak shift at 2972 cm−1 and 2862 cm−1 was due to C–H stretching of alkyls. The peak shift at 2320 cm−1 was due to the CN stretch of nitriles. The peak shift at 1350 cm−1 and 1013 cm−1 was due to the C–O stretch of ethers and the CO stretch of esters respectively supplementary Figure 4. These results provided evidence for the presence of proteins, polyphenols, flavonoids, and carbohydrates (due to functional groups of amides, hydroxyls and carbonyls) these functional groups provide capping during the synthesis of Ag-NPs as reported in many studies (Mathur, 2014) (Chung et al., 2016). The extract acts as both as the green reducing and stabilising agent, playing a pivotal role in forming Ag-NPs. Hence, the results of FT-IR confirm the formation of Ag-NPs from the extracts of Pearl millet husks (Pennisetum Glaucum) reporting for the first time."
17,Morphology of Ag-NPs using TEM,"6.1 Morphology of Ag-NPs using TEM TEM provided insight into the morphology and exact size details of the synthesised Ag-NPs. The TEM micrographs showed polydispersed Ag-NPs with a spherical shape, as shown in Fig. 4 . The particle sizes ranged from 10 to 30 nm, with an average particle size of 17 nm insupplentary Figure 6."
18,Morphology of Ag-NPs using SEM,"6.2 Morphology of Ag-NPs using SEM SEM was employed to analyse the structure of the nanoparticles that were formed. The micrographs, as shown in Fig. 5 , revealed that most of the Ag-NPs were relatively spherical in shape with some irregularly shaped due to aggregation into larger particles."
19,Morphology of Ag-NP doped charcoal catalyst using SEM,"6.3 Morphology of Ag-NP doped charcoal catalyst using SEM The morphology of the Ag-NPs doped charcoal catalyst was investigated using SEM. The micrographs are shown with a magnification of 100X and 14.10 KX, respectively in Fig. 6. The images reveal that most particles are spherical; however, not homogeneously dispersed on the surface of the charcoal."
20,Elemental analysis of Ag-NP doped charcoal catalyst using EDX,"6.4 Elemental analysis of Ag-NP doped charcoal catalyst using EDX The elemental analysis of the Ag-NP doped charcoal catalyst using Energy Dispersive X-ray confirmed doping of charcoal with Ag-NPs. Figure 14 shows the EDX spectrum with peaks between 3.00 and 3.40 keV corresponding to the characteristic binding energy of AgLa, AgLb and AgLg (Guzmán et al., 2009) with 11–26cps/eV. The peaks at binding energies of 0.3 keV and 0.5 keV were due to carbon and oxygen, respectively. The carbon and oxygen were attributed to the charcoal used as a support for Ag- NP adsorption. According to (Dimitrijević et al., 2013), “intensities of spectral lines in EDX analysis are proportional to element abundance”. Quantitative analysis showed a high silver content of 65.88% and that of carbon and oxygen at 20.62% and 13.50% respectively presented in Fig. 7 ."
21,Antimicrobial effect of Ag-NPs on chlorophyll concentration in algae,"Chlorophyll concentration as a measure of algal growth and photosynthetic efficiency was investigated to determine the antimicrobial effect of Ag-NPs. Chlorophyll concentration in algae was reduced following exposure to Ag-NPs for an incubation period of 7 days in contrast to the control (untreated algae) as shown insupplementary Figure 10 The decrease in chlorophyll concentration was dependent on the number of Ag-NPs present. 3.75 mM Ag-NPs gave the highest reduction (41.31%) of chlorophyll. It was also observed that the bright green coloured algae after exposure to Ag-NPs, turned dark green/brown due to the progressive reduction of chlorophyll concentration. The reduction in chlorophyll concentration showed that Ag-NPs had a toxic effect on the algae cells. The toxicity of Ag-NPs to algae is dependent on the nanoparticles specific surface area. Cells of plants, algae, and fungi possess semi-permeable cell walls that constitute a primary site for interaction and a barrier for the entrance of some molecules into their cells. The diameter of pores across the cell wall has an average thickness of 5–20 nm (Madigan et al., 2006). Thus nanoparticles smaller than pore are expected to pass through the cell wall and reach the cell membrane. Hence in this study, the average nanoparticle size was determined to be 17 nm; therefore, Ag-NPs could penetrate algae cell walls, hence the toxic effect. From the results shown insupplementary Figure 10, the Ag-NPs entered the cell and bound with organelles such as chloroplasts and pyrenoids, thus interfering with the photosynthesis processes hence the reduced chlorophyll concentration. It has also been noted that Ag-NPs in association with light alter the oxygen evolution complex, inhibit the electron transport activity as well as induce some structural deterioration thus resulting in algal death (Oukarroum et al., 2012). Supplementary Figure 10 illustrates that with an increase in Ag-NPs concentration, an increase in the reduction of chlorophyll concentration. However, at the highest level of 4.5 mM, a decrease was observed. This observation is due to homo-aggregation. Homo-aggregation occurs when nanoparticles assemble into clusters due to medium composition, such as ionic strength, pH and the concentration of natural organic matter (Schirmer et al., 2013). Homo-aggregation is due to higher collision frequency influenced by more nanoparticles (Baalousha et al., 2016). Therefore at a concentration of 4.5 mM, some Ag-NPs homo-aggregated to form larger nanoparticles; thus, they could not penetrate algae cells to disrupt cell activities such as photosynthesis effectively, which caused the unexpected lower reduction in chlorophyll concentration."
22,Antimicrobial effect of Ag-NPs on algae cell morphology,"7.1 Antimicrobial effect of Ag-NPs on algae cell morphology The antimicrobial activity of Ag-NPs was more pronounced against Gram-negative bacteria than with Gram-positive. This is because gram-negative bacteria have fragile cell walls of peptidoglycan, whereas gram-positive possess thick layers of peptidoglycan. Due to thin cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria, the Ag ions released from Ag-NPs penetrate the cell much easier, disrupting the cell wall and increasing cell membrane permeability leading to osmotic collapse and ultimately leads to cell death (Duong et al., 2016). And the formation of free radicals by AgNPs induces oxidative stress which can be considered to be another mechanism of cell death (Karumuri et al., 2013). The algae obtained from Von Bach dam and Swakop river was identified to be Spirogyra (Zygnematophyceae, Streptophyta) due to its filamentous nature and characteristic spiral chloroplasts after comparison with literature (Karumuri et al., 2013). Spirogyra algae obtained from the Von Bach dam and Swakop river, with cells full of cytoplasm, and the characteristic spiralling chloroplasts (Chen. C 2012). It shows Spirogyra algae after 7 days of exposure to Ag-NPs with cell membranes pulled away from the cell walls and appeared to be a dense mass of shrunk cells, and the loss of the spiral chloroplast structure. The mode of Ag-NPs action is through the disruption of the photosynthetic function of the chloroplasts. The photosynthetic capacity is disrupted possibly by the loss of their spiral structure, cytoplasm leakage, a cell collapse and loss of membrane integrity. However, no cell wall rupture was observed. Shows Spirogyra algae that died due to natural causes, it shows the failure of the spiral structure of the chloroplasts but does not reveal the cell membrane is pulling away from the cell wall to form a dense mass of shrunk cells. These investigations, confirms that Ag-NPs were able to penetrate the algae cell membrane causing cytoplasmic damage; thus, the shrunken appearance as the cytoplasm is responsible for the shape of the cell. Furthermore, there was damage to the chloroplasts hence the decrease in chlorophyll concentration, as explained in section 7.0."
23,Catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol,"The oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde was investigated employing Ag-NPs doped charcoal catalyst. With hydrogen peroxide as oxidant and acetonitrile medium, the reaction was run for 4 h at 80 °C. HPLC confirmed the product of the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol show the standard retention times as 2.18 min and benzaldehyde as 3.14 min, respectively. The reaction mixture showed the retention times of the reaction mixture at 1.34 min and 3.13 min respectively which corresponded with benzaldehyde. The retention time product at 3.13 min of the reaction mixture was not different from that obtained for the benzaldehyde standard, which confirms the product as benzaldehyde. Hence, comparing with the results from (Roduner, E., 2014, and Adil S. F et al., 2013) reported that substituted benzyl alcohol with AgNO3 and Na2CO3 in the air at 1 atm pressure, at 111 °C in toluene resulted in the production of benzaldehyde after a reaction time of 6 h. Hence it is, therefore, a limitation for broader use of these catalysts and reagents, as additives. Thus, the authors have developed for the first time a superior method for synthesizing Ag-NPs doped charcoal from Pearl millet (Pennisetum Glaucum) husk without the use of additives. The prepared material proved as a superactive catalyst for oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde."
24,Mechanism of benzyl alcohol oxidation with AgNPs doped on charcoal,"Essentially a catalyst creates a new reaction pathway with lower activation energy by providing a partial bond, which stabilises the transition state and compensates for part of the energy required to break a bond in the reactant before stabilisation by the newly formed bond takes over (Roduner, 2014). For the oxidation of benzyl alcohol, the Ag-NP doped charcoal catalyst facilitated the reaction between benzyl alcohol and hydroxyl radicals (from hydrogen peroxide) by lowering bond dissociation energy and making electron transfer between them more efficient. As the Ag-NP doped charcoal catalyst is heterogeneous, it was separated from the reaction mixture after reaction completion for re-use again supplementary Figure 11 depicts the reaction mechanism."
25,Conclusions,"The super active Ag-NPs were developed for the first time using Pearl millet (Pennisetum Glaucuum) husk for the treatment of water contaminated with algae and catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with Ag-NPs doped on charcoal. Ag-NPs were prepared using a biological method using Pearl Millet husk extract as a reducing and stabilising agent. There has been one report of Ag-NPs synthesis using Foxtail millet (Setaria italica). However, there is no report on the synthesis of Ag-NPs from Pearl Millet (Pennisetum Glaucuum) husk, which is a widely grown grain in Africa. At optimum conditions, the Ag-NPs formed a Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) peak at a wavelength of 429 nm. The SEM and TEM analysis reveals that Ag-NPs are spherical and possess polydispersed 17 nm average-sized nanoparticles. The Ag-NPs displayed antimicrobial effect on algae with 41.31% reduction of chlorophyll concentration over a 7 day incubation period. The antimicrobial activity was also evidenced by the change in morphology of algal cells by disruption of the characteristic helical structure of chloroplasts. Thus Ag-NPs have the potential for algae control. Furthermore, Ag-NPs displayed catalytic activity for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with 90% conversion thus can be used as efficient catalysts for oxidation reactions. From these findings, it is concluded that a novel method of treating water contaminated with algae is developed for the first the time using Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) husk extract to generate Ag-NPs, which exhibited excellent antimicrobial activity. Furthermore, Ag-NPs doped on charcoal are useable as an efficient catalyst, for the value-added transformation of alcohols to aldehydes."
