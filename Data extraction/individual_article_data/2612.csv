0,Introduction,"With the utilization and exploitation of marine resources, marine engineering steel has been widely used [1–7]. To adapt the future marine equipment, marine engineering steel with high corrosion and stress corrosion cracking resistance and high thickness is required. Most of the connections between marine steels are weld. The corrosion and stress corrosion cracking (SCC) problems of marine steel in the heat-affected zone after welding become difficult problems in engineering applications [6,8–11]. The welded metal is easily affected by corrosion, hydrogen embrittlement, SCC [7,12–14]. The heat-affected zone (HAZ) microstructure, including intercritical heat affected zone (ICHAZ), fine-grained heat-affected zone (FGHAZ), coarse-grained heat-affected zone (CGHAZ), determines the basic properties of the materials [2,6,7,12]. Huang et al. [15] reported that low carbon bainite was less sensitive to hydrogen induced cracking than martensite. Hydrogen induced cracking is also found to initiate at interfaces of ferrite and pearlite bands [16,17]. After welding, the microstructure of the heat-affected zone experiences different thermal cycles according to the distance from the location of the welding seam, resulting in the alteration of the microstructure. In this paper, simulated microstructures are selected to conduct experiments, which can quantitatively illustrate the SCC behaviors of different microstructures and provides convenience for laboratory research [2,6,18–20]. Zhang et al. [21] indicated that microstructure was an important factor that affected hydrogen permeation and hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility. They found that HE susceptibility from high to low was CGHAZ, FGHAZ, ICHAZ by high-pressure gaseous hydrogen permeation test and slow strain rate tensile test (SSRT). Wu et al. [6] and Ma et al. [2] reported that the bainite high-strength low-alloy (HSLA) steel and the simulated HAZ microstructures exhibited a high SCC susceptibility in a simulated marine atmosphere. Wu et al. [6] confirmed that the SCC susceptibility of the bainite HSLA steel and the simulated HAZ microstructures increased in the following order: FGHAZ < ICHAZ < CGHAZ. But Ma et al. [2] reported that the SCC susceptibility of the E690 steel and the simulated HAZ microstructures gradually increased in the following order in a SO2-polluted marine atmosphere: CGHAZ < FGHAZ < ICHAZ. Li et al. [22] found that the HAZ microstructures and the base metal (BM) exhibited different SCC susceptibilities in artificial seawater (ASW): FGHAZ < ICHAZ < BM < CGHAZ. The different results suggest that environmental factors may influence susceptibility results, especially in high hydrogen pressure and/or sulfur-containing environment. Cathodic protection is one of the most effective method to inhibit corrosion [1,5,23–27]. Many rersearchers have proposed that sulfate-reducing bacteria could attach to metals [23,28–34], resulting in the formation of an acidic environment around the metal without oxygen but containing H2S [4,34,35]. The relationship between the corrosion, hydrogen permeation and SCC in the heat affected zone in special environments under cathodic protection is worth our in-depth study. According to the results of our previous studies [35], the hydrogen permeability of E690 steel was increased by adding thiosulfate at the same cathodic potential. However, due to changes in the interface pH value and the catalytic capacity of sulfide, the maximum hydrogen permeation current is reached at −850 mVSCE [35]. The hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility also reaches the maximum value under this condition. Electrochemical test, hydrogen permeation experiment, and SSRT experiment were used to study the SCC of HAZ microstructures in ASW and the deaerated, acidified ASWs with thiosulfate solutions at open circuit potential (OCP) or cathodic protection. In this sulfur-containing environment, the effects of electrochemical reactions, hydrogen permeation, and microstructure on SCC were analyzed. The SCC sensitivities of HAZ microstructures (ICHAZ, FGHAZ, and CGHAZ) were ranked in ASW and the deaerated, acidified ASWs with thiosulfate solutions at OCP or cathodic protection."
1,Experimental,
2,Material and solution,"2.1 Material and solution The materials used in this work were cut from a thick plate of E690 HSLA steel. The chemical composition of the steel is listed in Table 1 . The microstructure of the steel consists of the lath bainite with fine grains, with the mechanical properties: yield strength and tensile strength of about 690 MPa and 720 MPa, respectively. The simulated HAZ microstructures were prepared by muffle furnace heat treatment, which has been used by many researchers [2,6,18–20]. These researchers [2,6] calculated the austenite formation temperature the start temperature of austenitization (Ac1), and the temperature of complete austenitization (Ac3) of E690 steel according to the Andrews empirical formula. As a result, the preparation technology of CGHAZ, FGHAZ, and ICHAZ thermal simulation microstructures in the welding heat-affected zone was finally determined, which were obtained by heating at 1300 °C, 850 °C and 750 °C respectively for 10 min and cooling to room temperature in the air. The solution and cathodic potential used in this study are listed as follows: (i) The ASW based on ASTM D1141 was used as the solution with the chemical composition given in Table 2 . The pH value was adjusted by the 5 wt% NaOH solution to 8.2. (ii) As mentioned in our previous work [4], the sulfur-containing artificial seawater (ASS solution) is deaerated and acidified ASWs with 10−2 mol/L Na2S2O3. The ASW was purged with N2 for 4 h to obtain an anaerobic environment and adjusted by acetic acid to pH 4.0. (iii) The ASS solution was used in the study, which was conducted under cathodic potential (−850 mVSCE). In our previous work [35], the base metal of E690 steel has the highest hydrogen permeation current and the highest SCC susceptibility at −850 mVSCE in ASS solution."
3,Microstructure characterization and microhardness test,"2.2 Microstructure characterization and microhardness test The BM and heat-treated specimens used for microstructure observation are ground with sandpaper to 5000 # and then polished with a 1.5 μm diamond grinding paste. The Vickers microhardness of the BM and heat-treated specimens was measured by automatic turret digital display microhardness tester with image analysis (JMHVS-1000ZCCD). Five sites were measured on each sample to obtain the representative hardness data. To better analyze the microstructure of the BM and heat-treated specimens, the samples were etched with 4 vol% nital solution and saturated picric acid to observe the microstructures by scanning electron microscope (SEM, Quanta 250) and optical microscope (OM)."
4,Electrochemical test,"2.3 Electrochemical test The BM and heat-treated specimens (10 mm × 10 mm × 5 mm) used for the electrochemical tests were coated with epoxy, leaving an exposed area of 1.0 cm2 as the working surface, and then were polished sequentially to 1500 # by an emery paper. The specimens were degreased in dehydrated ethanol, rinsed with deionized, and dried in air. The conventional three-electrode system with the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode, the platinum plate as the counter electrode, and the steel (including the BM and heat-treated specimens) as the working electrode was used in this study. Electrochemical tests in ASW and ASS solution were conducted through the Zennium-E electrochemical workstation. To expose a fresh working electrode surface, the working electrode was applied to a constant potential −1.2 VSCE for 5 min. Open circuit potential was kept for 0.5 h to reach a steady-state. The potentiodynamic polarization curves were measured from −1.2 VSCE until the anodic current exceeded 1 mA, with the scan rate of 0.333 mV/s. All the tests were performed at the ambient temperature of 22 °C and repeated three times to verify the reproducibility."
5,Hydrogen permeation test,"2.4 Hydrogen permeation test The hydrogen permeation test was conducted in the Devanthan-Stachurski cell which consists of two compartments, namely the charging cell and oxidation cell. According to ASTM G148, the hydrogen permeation specimens were prepared with a size of 20 mm × 15 mm × 1.5 mm, leaving an exposed area of 1.5 cm2 as the working surface. The oxidation side of the specimen was ground up to 5000 # and polished with a 1.5 μm diamond grinding paste. To ensure the stability of the current on the oxidation side, the samples on this side were electrochemically plated at a galvanostatic current density of 3 mA/cm2 for 10 min, with nickel coating in Watt coating bath with a chemical composition of 250 g/L NiSO4·6H2O + 45 g/L NiCl2·6H2O + 40 g/L H3BO3. The charging side of the specimen was ground up to 1500# and then rinsed with ethanol and acetone. Nickel plating will allow hydrogen to enter the sample. To avoid interference from nickel plating into hydrogen, the samples were put in a vacuum drying box for 24 h at 150 °C. Oxidation of diffused hydrogen and recording of anodic current requires an applied potential of + 300 mVSCE in NaOH (0.2 mol/L) which were purged with N2 for 4 h. When the background current density declined to below 0.1 μA/cm2, the testing solution (ASS solution) was introduced to the charging cell. When the external cathodic potential is needed, the three-electrode system of external potential is connected immediately. All the tests were performed at 22 °C and repeated three times to check the reproducibility. After finishing the permeation tests, hydrogen permeation parameters including the effective diffusion coefficient (D eff, cm2·s−1), hydrogen flux (J, mol·cm−2·s−1), and apparent hydrogen concentration (C app, mol·cm−3) were calculated from the obtained permeation curves. There are two ways to measure the D eff, namely t lag and t b methods. Method t lag is applied when the hydrogen permeation current density is under steady-state, and method t b is applied when the hydrogen permeation current density has a peak value. The calculation equations are: (1) D eff = L 2 6 t lag (2) D eff = L 2 15 . 3 t b (3) J = i ss nF (4) C app = J · L D eff where i ss is the steady-state permeation current, F is the Faraday’s constant, L is the specimen thickness, t lag means the time when 63% of the steady-state current density was reached, t b means the breakthrough time for hydrogen to be detected after commencing hydrogen charging."
6,Slow strain rate tensile test (SSRT),"2.5 Slow strain rate tensile test (SSRT) SSRT method was used to investigate SCC behavior of the E690 base metal and the simulated HAZ microstructures in ASW and ASS solution at OCP and −850 mVSCE. SSRT specimens were prepared according to GB/T 15970.6 [36] and were then ground with sandpaper along the stretch direction to 1500 #, wiped with an alcohol sponge, and dried in air. To ensure the stability of the surface state and hydrogen entering the steel, the SSRT specimens were immersed in the test solution for 12 h. SSRT experiments were carried out with a tensile rate of 0.0018 mm/min, yielding a strain rate of 10−6/s using the WDML-30KN Material Test System in air and solution. Each test was performed at least three times to eliminate instrument and environmental influences. To quantitatively characterize the HE susceptibilities of E690 steel and the simulated HAZ microstructures, the fracture time (I t) was calculated using the following equations according to GB/T 15970.7 [37]: (5) I t = 1 - t s t 0 × 100 % where t s and t 0 are the fracture time of the steel testd solutions and air, respectively."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Microstructure,"3.1 Microstructure Fig. 1 shows the microstructure characteristics of E690 steel and the simulated HAZ microstructures used in the present work. The OM (a, c, e, g) and SEM (b, d, f, h) micrographs exhibit BM, ICHAZ, FGHAZ, CGHAZ. The BM consists of a bainite microstructure with a prior austenite grain size degree of 8.0. ICHAZ consists of the martensite-austenite (M-A) island and polygonal ferrite (PF) or tempered bainite (TB). ICHAZ is the partial phase change recrystallization structure with coarse and uneven grains. The grain of FGHAZ is fine and uniform. FGHAZ, with complete phase change recrystallization, contains granular bainite (GB). CGHAZ is a superheated coarse grain area with large grain size. CGHAZ consists of a small amount of GB and lath bainite (LB) with prior austenite grain boundary. Our previous work has shown the same results [2,6,11]. The average prior austenite grain sizes of BM, FGHAZ and CGHAZ, which are measured by the intercept method, are 17.59 μm, 8.53 μm and 52.17 μm, respectively."
9,Electrochemical behavior,"3.2 Electrochemical behavior To investigate the effect of microstructure on the electrochemical behavior of different heat-treated steels in ASW and the deaerated, acidified ASW with thiosulfate, the polarization curves are measured and shown in Fig. 2 . It can be seen from Fig. 2a that in ASW, CGHAZ has a lower corrosion potential, a lower cathodic current density, and a higher anodic current density than FGHAZ. Compared with FGHAZ, the anodic reaction of CGHAZ is promoted. When the solution is acidified and deoxidized and the S2O3 2− is added, the corrosion potential of CGHAZ is slightly lower than that of the FGHAZ because of the difference in surface activity of the simulated HAZ microstructures (Fig. 2b). In addition, the results demonstrate that the diffusion process dominates the cathodic reactions. In this case, the cathodic reactions (including H2O reduction and thiosulfate reduction) are the same. So, hydrogen production capacity is the same at the surfaces of simulated HAZ microstructures. Li et al. [22] proved that the corrosion current density of CGHAZ of E690 steel was higher than that of FGHAZ in ASW. Zhao et al. [18] reported that CGHAZ had the lowest corrosion resistance because of its special M-A island structure. From the environmental perspective, the cathodic limit current density in ASW is about 5 × 10−5 A/cm2, and 6 × 10−2 A/cm2 in the deaerated acidified ASW with thiosulfate. After adding thiosulfate, the electrolyte becomes more severe and corrosive [4,35]. The primary reason for improvements in corrosion resistance for grain-refined materials is attributed to an improvement in corrosion product protectiveness and adhesion due to increased grain boundary density [38]. It has been pointed out that the electrochemical reaction of HSLA steel mainly depends on the chemical composition, while the difference of microstructure has little influence on the electrochemical performance [38]. Park et al. [39] pointed out that the fine-grained steel (14 μm grain size) has better corrosion resistance than the coarse-grained steel (35 μm grain size)."
10,Hydrogen permeation behavior,"3.3 Hydrogen permeation behavior Fig. 3 shows the hydrogen permeation curves and parameters of the base metal and simulated HAZ microstructures in the deaerated, acidified ASWs with thiosulfate solutions at OCP and −850 mVSCE. In the stage of hydrogen permeation analysis, the amount of hydrogen produced in the alkaline environment is small, so the environment of artificial seawater is not used as the research object. The charging cell is filled with acidic thiosulfate-containing artificial seawater (pH = 4). The hydrogen ions in the solution are reduced to a large number of H atoms which can be trapped by the E690 steel [40]. The H atoms enter the steel matrix due to the difference in concentration and the promotion of H2S which is produced by reactions (6) and (7) [41]. The hydrogen atoms diffuse to the oxidation side and then are oxidized on the oxidation side to form H2. (6) S 2 O 3 2 - + 6 H + + 4 e - = 2 S 0 + 3 H 2 O E 0 = 0 . 465 V SHE (7) 2 S 0 + 4 H + + 4 e - = 2 H 2 S E 0 = 0 . 142 V SHE The calculated parameters for the hydrogen permeation of E690 steel and the simulated HAZ microstructures, including i ss, time to peak, D eff, J ss, and C app in the acidified ASW containing thiosulfate at OCP and −850 mVSCE are calculated according to Eqs. (1)–(4) and shown in Fig. 3b–f and Table 3 . Because of the unsteady current density (the peak value) in the hydrogen permeability curve, the hydrogen permeability parameters were calculated by t b method, as shown in Fig. 3d. The applied cathodic potential increases the hydrogen permeation steady-state current density of the CGHAZ to 8.86 ± 1.95 μA/cm2, and the FGHAZ to 8.79 ± 0.87 μA/cm2 (Fig. 3). As we have previously studied, the synergistic effect of cathodic polarization and thiosulfate makes the hydrogen permeation current maximized at −850 mVSCE [35]. For ICHAZ, the effect of thiosulfate and cathodic potential on the increase of hydrogen permeation current was delayed. The peak time of ICHAZ is 4.49 ± 0.32 h at OCP and 7.44 ± 1.73 h at −850 mVSCE, which is higher than any other microstructures (BM, FGHAZ, CGHAZ). On the contrary, hydrogen permeation flux (J ss) of ICHAZ is 0.68 ± 0.10 × 10−11 mol·cm−2·s−1 at OCP and 4.09 ± 1.77 × 10−11 mol·cm−2·s−1 at −850 mVSCE (Table 3). The polarization curve analysis shows that the hydrogen production capacity of the cathodic reaction is the same. So it is speculated that the hydrogen content in the ICHAZ is higher than that in any other microstructures (BM, FGHAZ, CGHAZ). It is generally believed that, after hydrogen entering the interior of the material, it is preferentially enriched in defects such as dislocation, grain boundary, inclusion, and the phase boundary [42–44]. 3.3.1 Hydrogen permeation analysis in ASS at OCP According to the cathodic polarization curve (Fig. 2), the cathodic limiting current density increase from 5 × 10−5 to 6 × 10−2 A/cm2 after the addition of S2O3 2−. So, it can be seen that the addition of S2O3 2− promotes the process of hydrogen reduction (Eqs. (6)). It is proved that S2O3 2− promotes hydrogen permeation current density growth rapidly in our previous work [4]. Wu et al. [28] confirmed that H2S produced by the SRB accelerated the hydrogen permeation of the steel and enhanced C app on the specimen. However, as can be seen from Fig. 3a, the hydrogen permeation current of the ICHAZ increases slowly, indicating that it takes a long time for hydrogen to permeate from the hydrogen-producing side to the hydrogen escaping side of the ICHAZ (Fig. 3c). It can be seen from Fig. 3e and f that the hydrogen permeation flux and apparent hydrogen concentration of the ICHAZ are the lowest. And the final manifestation is that hydrogen diffusion is slow in the ICHAZ. The quasi-steady-state current drops with the extension of hydrogen permeation test time, indicating that the corrosion products have a certain resistance to hydrogen permeation. The quasi-steady state current of the simulated HAZ microstructures stabilizes about 20 h later, indicating that the difference of H oxidation current in the simulated HAZ microstructures is small. 3.3.2 Hydrogen permeation analysis in ASS at −850 mVSCE The steady-state hydrogen permeation current density after applying potential is higher than at OCP, because of the larger H concentration gradient. The corrosion product film (mackinawite, FeS), which is produced at OCP, has a certain blocking effect on hydrogen permeation [4,31,45,46]. The difference of steady-state hydrogen permeation current density of the microstructures is too low to be distinguished at OCP (after hydrogen permeation test 20 h). However, the values of steady-state current density vary with different microstructures at −850 mVSCE (after hydrogen permeation test 10 h). The reason is that the hydrogen production rate on the reduction side is small, and the hydrogen diffusion rate differs little at OCP. On the oxidation side, the hydrogen atom can be rapidly oxidized on time. The oxidation current, which is the hydrogen permeation current, is generated in this process. The oxidation points on the oxidation side are not fully occupied so that the final hydrogen permeation current density is approximate. After imposing the cathodic potential, the hydrogen production rate on the reduction side is greatly increased, and the difference in hydrogen concentration is also large. On the oxidation side, the rate of oxidation of the diffused hydrogen is greatly increased. But all the oxidation points on the oxidation side are occupied. Ultimately, it makes the hydrogen permeation current density different after hydrogen permeation test 10 h. After applying the cathodic polarization potential, the time of the instantaneous rise of hydrogen permeation current density curve is shortened greatly. The main reason is that the hydrogen concentration gradient on the reduction side and the oxidation side of the hydrogen atom is larger at −850 mVSCE than that at OCP. Literature has also shown that the susceptibility to hydrogen-induced cracking and the amount of diffusible hydrogen significantly increased with increasing H2S partial pressures [45]. After applying the cathodic polarization potential, the delay effect of ICHAZ's hydrogen permeation current density curve was more obvious. The peak time of ICHAZ was 2.5 times higher than that of FGHAZ. The M-A island and the phase interface between M-A islands and ferrite in ICHAZ are both active sites for hydrogen pinning. ICHAZ has more active sites than FGHAZ and CGHAZ. The hydrogen atom pinned into the steel matrix and then be free from the nailing action [2,6]. It takes time to overflow the steel matrix. The active site of ICHAZ mostly consumes a certain amount of time through this process. Thus, it can be realized as a delayed effect on the hydrogen permeation current density curve. Jiang et al. [47] demonstrated that the dislocation walls and cells hindered the diffusion of hydrogen, and homogeneous distribution of dislocations dispersed trap sites for capturing hydrogen."
11,Mechanical performance and SCC analysis,"3.4 Mechanical performance and SCC analysis 3.4.1 Basic mechanical properties of E690 steel and the simulated HAZ microstructures The stress–strain curves (a) and Vickers micro-hardness (b) of the E690 steel and the simulated HAZ microstructures used in this work in air are shown in Fig. 4 . The yield strength and ultimate tensile strength, the parameters calculated including the reduction of area, elongation, and rupture time of the E690 steel and the simulated HAZ microstructures after SSRT in air are shown in Fig. 5 . In the welding process, in the area far from the weld, a part of the structures undergo phase change recrystallization, resulting in a part of the phase change area, which is known as the ICHAZ. The ICHAZ structure is composed of two phases, a tissue-softened polygonal ferrite (PF) or tempered bainite (TB), and the hard and brittle M-A islands which are to be precipitated along the austenite grain boundary. It can be seen from Fig. 4a (the stress–strain curve) and Fig. 5a that the yield stress (YS) of ICHAZ is lower than that of the BM. As can be seen from Figs. 4 and 5, the ultimate tensile stress (UTS) of ICHAZ is higher than the BM, with the lowest Vickers hardness, the largest elongation, and the longest fracture time compared with other microstructures. Ishikawa et al. [20] reported that ICHAZ had a higher deformation capacity and that microscopic strain localization occurred in the ferrite phase adjacent to the ferrite/bainite boundary. The softened ferrite structure produced during the recrystallization phase transition is responsible for the lower yield strength and hardness. The high tensile strength is mainly due to the presence of a diffuse distribution of M-A islands, which have the effect of dispersion strengthening after precipitation in the structure (ICHAZ). Ferrite becomes the channel for dislocation slip, which enables dislocation to slip in the long-range. As a result, ICHAZ has a higher elongation rate [20], and thus shows a longer fracture time in the SSRT test, compared with other microstructures. As can be seen from Figs. 4 and 5, the hardness, the yield strength and tensile strength of the fine crystal structure are the highest, but the elongation is the lowest. Fine-grained heat affected zone (FGHAZ) is formed by recrystallization of complete phase transition at the position slightly closed to the weld and slightly higher peak temperature during the welding process. Fine-grain structure, containing granular bainite, smaller grain size, due to the effect of fine-grain strengthening, resulting in higher hardness and tensile strength. Because of grain refinement, the grain boundary area is larger than other structures, increasing dislocation slip resistance. In the plastic deformation process, granular bainite and M-A islands have poor deformation coordination ability, so stress concentration and dislocation plugging are easy to occur near M-A islands, thus have low elongation [48]. The hardness of the CGHAZ is higher than ICHAZ, the toughness is significantly reduced, the elongation is larger than FGHAZ, and the reduction of area is the lowest. Grain boundary has a hindrance to dislocation slip [2,3,5,39]. Because the amount of grain boundary after grain coarsening is small, the dislocation slip resistance is low. Besides, those dispersed M-A islands are relatively small, which makes CGHAZ difficult to produce local stress concentration and lower toughness in the CGHAZ. Thus, the elongation is larger than the base material (BM) and fine crystal structure (FGHAZ). It can be seen from the SEM diagram (Fig. 8a, Fig. 9a, and Fig. 10a) of fracture afterward that the necking phenomenon of CGHAZ after tensile fracture is less obvious than that of FGHAZ and ICHAZ. The reduction of area of CGHAZ fractured in air is lower than that of other structures, which may be because there are fewer grain boundaries and lower toughness of lath-bainite in the CGHAZ. Wu et al. [6] also obtained the same result that the necking phenomenon and dimples of CGHAZ were not obvious from the fracture morphologies of the microstructures of HSLA steel after SSRT experiments in a SO2-containing marine atmospheric environment. The dispersed M-A islands in the CGHAZ are relatively small, which is not easy to produce local stress concentration. Therefore, the elongation is larger than the base material and the FGHAZ, and the elongation loss is smaller. 3.4.2 SCC analysis in ASW and the deaerated, acidified ASWs with thiosulfate solutions at OCP and −850 mVSCE Fig. 6 shows the stress–strain curves of the E690 steel and the simulated HAZ microstructures used in this work in ASW (a), the deaerated, acidified ASWs with thiosulfate solutions at OCP (b) and −850 mVSCE (c). The calculated parameters were shown in Fig. 7 , including rupture time (a), HE susceptibility indexes in terms of rupture time loss (b) and the three-dimensional image (c). It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the stress–strain curves of each microstructure in artificial seawater are completed in ASW. In the deaerated, acidified ASW with thiosulfate solutions at OCP, the elongation of each structure decreases as compared with ASW. At −850 mVSCE, the elongation of each structure goes on decreasing greatly, and each structure ruptures before the tensile strength reaches the ultimate tensile stress (UTS) in air. It can be seen from Fig. 7a that the fracture time is the longest in air and slightly shorter in the solution than in air. It is further shortened in the deaerated, acidified ASWs with thiosulfate solutions at OCP, and the fracture time is greatly shortened after applying the cathodic potential (-850 mVSCE). It can be seen from Fig. 7b and c that, there is a low SCC susceptibility, and the fracture susceptibility of all microstructures is within 20% in ASW. It indicates that the SCC susceptibility in ASW obtained based on fracture time is about 13%, which is lower than that reported by Ma et al. [1]. This may be due to the slight strength difference between the steels and the indicator for calculating susceptibility used in these two works. The fracture time of the substrate is longer than that of other structures and the SCC susceptibility is the least at open circuit potential (OCP) and cathodic potential (-850 mVSCE). 3.4.3 SCC analysis of the ICHAZ Fig. 8 shows the fracture morphologies of ICHAZ after SSRT tests in air (a1–a3), ASW (b1–b3), and the deaerated, acidified ASWs with thiosulfate solutions at OCP (c1–c4) and −850 mVSCE (d1–d4). There are obvious dimples and necking in Fig. 8a1. In ASW, although the fracture has a part of the flat surface, the phenomenon of dimples and necking are more prominent, so it belongs to ductile fracture(Fig. 8b1–b3). In the thiosulfate-containing solution, hydrogen sulfide was produced in the solution by chemical reaction. Hydrogen sulfide promotes H atoms to enter the sample, which makes the sample exhibits a certain SCC susceptibility. Meanwhile, the SCC wall appears (c1), and pitting is observed at the fracture edge (c2 and c3), indicating that the anodic dissolution (AD) of ICHAZ has a certain influence on the initiation of cracks [20,49]. It has been pointed out that crack initiation occurs at the pitting [1,2,4,35,50]. It can be seen from the polarization curve (Fig. 4c) that at −850 mVSCE, H atoms are reduced to hydrogen by the cathodic reactions, and the concentration and content of H atoms on the sample surface are increased. The area of SCC wall is enlarged (Fig. 8d1), and the river-pattern cracks (d2) are extremely increased. The transverse and longitudinal cracks coexist (d3 and d4), which further proves that the cracks grow along the M-A island and PF phase interface [2,6]. When the crack is perpendicular to the interface, the crack propagation is hindered [1,3,51]. Ferrite is softer than M-A island. The large lattice mismatch between M-A islands and ferrite could produce dislocation pile-up and stress concentration around the M-A islands under the tensile stress. The stress concentration at the interface of the two phases is relatively large, which provides convenient conditions for the initiation of cracks [2]. Under the action of stress, the phase interface produces more dislocation, resulting in dislocation pile-up, which provides more sites for the capture of hydrogen atoms and is prone to hydrogen embrittlement [52,53]. On the other hand, the soft ferrite and the hard M-A island form a corrosive micro-battery that produces a micro-couple effect [2,49]. The insoluble M-A island, as the cathode, accelerates the AD of ferrite and promotes the nucleation and propagation of SCC cracks under the stress [2]. 3.4.4 SCC analysis of the FGHAZ Fig. 9 shows the morphologies of the fracture surface of FGHAZ after SSRT tests in different environments. Just like ICHAZ, there was necking in the macro fracture (a1) and the dimple in the microfracture surface (a2 and a3). There were still necking (b1) and dimples (b2) in ASW, but a flat surface (SCC wall) appears at the edge of the fracture surface (b2). So, the stress corrosion cracking of FGHAZ is slightly more sensitive than ICHAZ in ASW. This conclusion is consistent with the calculated results of SCC susceptibility (Fig. 7b and c). In the thiosulfate-containing solution, the SCC wall area (Fig. 9c1) of the macroscopic fracture surface is enlarged due to hydrogen embrittlement. In this environment, the pitting occurs at the edge of the fracture (Fig. 9c3), indicating that hydrogen embrittlement cracks initiate at the bottom of the pitting. Much literature has also proved that ferrous sulfide, the corrosion product produced by thiosulfate in solution, promotes the production of metal pitting [4,30,35,45,46,54]. Pitting leads to stress concentration and provides the source of crack initiation [4,23]. In the acidic solution containing thiosulfate, the area of the SCC wall is further enlarged by applying cathodic potential to the metal (d1). The river pattern morphology (d2) and phase interface cracks (d3) appear at the fracture surface. The cracking of FGHAZ in this environment belongs to the cracking along LB-phase boundary (transgranular fracture). The grain boundary of FGHAZ has the resistance to dislocation slip. Stress concentration and dislocation plug were generated at granular bainite, M-A island, and grain boundary to promote brittle fracture. When the crack along the phase interface is perpendicular to the grain boundary, it provides resistance to crack propagation [1–3]. That makes the SCC susceptibility of FGHAZ slightly lower than that of ICHAZ and higher than that of CGHAZ in this environment. 3.4.5 SCC analysis of the CGHAZ Fig. 10 shows the morphologies of the fracture surface of CGHAZ after SSRT tests in air (a1-a3), ASW (b1-b3), the deaerated, acidified ASWs with thiosulfate solutions at OCP (c1-c3) and −850 mVSCE (d1-d3). It can be seen from Fig. 10a1-a3 that the fracture surface of CGHAZ has necking and dimples, which is a typical ductile fracture in air. In ASW, dimples are still present, but as can be seen from the enlarged image, the fracture edges tend to be flat relative to in air. The fracture of CGHAZ tends to be flat compared with FGHAZ, which qualitatively means that the SCC susceptibility of CGHAZ is slightly higher than FGHAZ in ASW. The reason is the resistance to crack propagation from the grain boundary, which will be explained in detail later [3,53]. In the deaerated, acidified ASWs with thiosulfate solutions at OCP, H atoms are promoted by hydrogen sulfide to enter the CGHAZ matrix, which laid a foundation for hydrogen embrittlement of CGHAZ. In Fig. 10c1, SCC wall appears and the fracture is flat. Similar to FGHAZ, some pitting appears at the edge of the fracture, which indicates that the crack initiation of CGHAZ in this environment was related to pitting. Our previous results also show that S2O3 2− promotes the initiation and growth of corrosion pits and increases SCC susceptibility of E690 steel [4]. The appearance of pitting also contributes to the fracture of CGHAZ. In other words, the SCC susceptibility of CGHAZ is affected by the interaction of grain boundary with crack propagation resistance, pitting corrosion, and hydrogen. In this environment, the grain boundary of CGHAZ is less and the resistance to crack propagation is less. The SCC susceptibility of CGHAZ is still dominated by grain boundary, although the hydrogen content of FGHAZ is slightly more than that of CGHAZ. As a result, the SCC susceptibility of CGHAZ is slightly higher than that of FGHAZ. After applying the cathodic potential, the three-phase boundary intersection point (underlined in yellow) of the coarse austenite grains appeares (Fig. 10d3). The results show that CGHAZ belongs to intergranular cracking (IG). Some relevant researchers believe that IG was an important degradation mechanism in the coarse-grain steel grade [55,56]. The higher dislocation density and coarse grains in the coarse grain structure increase the initiation and propagation of cracks, resulting in high SCC susceptibility [22]. Compared with the inner grain bainite, the austenite grain boundary has higher potential, so the grain boundary is served as the cathode to corrode at OCP in ASWs. Compared with FGHAZ, CGHAZ has fewer grain boundaries, and the resistance of grain boundaries to crack propagation is smaller than that of FGHAZ. There is a small amount of granular bainite in CGHAZ, which makes the stress concentration effect around granular bainite smaller. Liu et al.[57] reported that the anti-hydrogen brittleness of dual-phase and twinning induced plasticity steel was improved by reducing the inclusion density and size. Because the CGHAZ has less grain boundary, the hydrogen binding at these defects is also less, and therefore less sensitive to hydrogen embrittlement as compared with the ICHAZ. In this environment, H plays a dominant role in the SCC susceptibility of CGHAZ."
12,Comprehensive influence of microstructure on SCC,"3.5 Comprehensive influence of microstructure on SCC Table 4 shows the SCC mechanism, and the influence of electrochemical, hydrogen permeation, and secondary crack on SCC susceptibility of different microstructures in different environments. In ASW, thermally simulated microstructures have a certain SCC susceptibility (CGHAZ > FGHAZ > ICHAZ), which is less than 20% (Fig. 7b and c). It can be seen from the polarization curve (Fig. 2a) that the corrosion potential and cathodic limit current density of FGHAZ are higher than CGHAZ, and the anodic reaction of CGHAZ is promoted. Based on the above information, we can conclude that FGHAZ has better corrosion resistance than CGHAZ in ASW. In ASW, corrosion is primarily responsible for the SCC of the structure. The SCC mechanism of the simulated HAZ microstructures is AD in ASW. In the deaerated, acidified ASWs with thiosulfate solutions at OCP, the SCC susceptibility of the simulated HAZ microstructures was CGHAZ > FGHAZ > ICHAZ and ranged from 35% to 50% (Fig. 7b and c). In the polarization curve (Fig. 2b), it can be seen that the corrosion potential of FGHAZ is higher than that of CGHAZ, and the three thermal simulated structures in the limit current density are the same, so the anodic polarization curve of FGHAZ shifts to the left. It is concluded that the addition of sulfur species reduces the corrosion resistance of all the simulated HAZ microstructures, and FGHAZ has better corrosion resistance than CGHAZ. The diffusion flux (D eff) and surface hydrogen concentration (C app) of CGHAZ were higher than those of FGHAZ in the hydrogen permeation test. After 12 h, the steady-state hydrogen permeation current density of all the simulated HAZ microstructures was the same. S2O3 2− promoted hydrogen permeation in all the simulated HAZ microstructures. There was a 12 h prefilled hydrogen before the SSRT test. So S2O3 2− has no obvious effect on SCC between ICHAZ, FGHAZ, and CGHAZ in the deaerated acidified ASWs with thiosulfate solutions at OCP. Therefore, the SCC susceptibility of the simulated HAZ microstructures should be analyzed from the aspect of corrosion. Secondary cracks appeared in both CGHAZ and FGHAZ, but not in ICHAZ, and pitting was distributed in CGHAZ. The cracks in CGHAZ were generated from pitting corrosion (Fig. 11 c1–c3). Regardless of the influence of microstructure on SCC, crack initiation occurs at pit bottom in the deaerated, acidified ASW with thiosulfate solutions at OCP (Fig. 12 ). Microcrack is the premise of SCC, and the SCC mechanisms of the simulated HAZ microstructures are AD and HE in this environment. In the deaerated, acidified ASWs with thiosulfate solutions at −850 mVSCE, the SCC susceptibility of the simulated HAZ microstructures was ICHAZ > FGHAZ > CGHAZ, above 55% even up to 70%. According to the polarization curve (Fig. 2c), the limit current density at the impressed cathodic potential (-850 mVSCE) is the same, which proves that the hydrogen production capacity of the surface of the simulated HAZ microstructures is the same in this environment. In the hydrogen permeation test (Fig. 3), the calculation parameters between the simulated HAZ microstructures are different in size, both C app and i ss: CGHAZ > FGHAZ > ICHAZ, the pinning hydrogen inside the microstructures (C P): ICHAZ > FGHAZ > CGHAZ. Alvaro et. al [58] reported that the hydrogen in lattice interstitials was mainly responsible for the embrittlement by 3D cohesive modelling. In the side surface morphologies of the fractured steel, ICHAZ has the most cracks and deep cracks, followed by FGHAZ and CGHAZ. In Fig. 11d1–d3, ICHAZ has the most cracks and deep cracks, followed by FGHAZ and CGHAZ. The applied potential further promotes hydrogen permeation and SCC in all the simulated HAZ microstructures, but it has the most obvious promotion effect on ICHAZ. Because ICHAZ contains the most pinning hydrogen, and FGHAZ has more grain boundaries and more defects. The cracking forms of ICHAZ, FGHAZ and CGHAZ are phase boundary cracking, LB-cracking and intergranular fracture, respectively (Fig. 12). SCC mechanisms of the simulated HAZ microstructures are dominated by HE in this environment. Grain boundaries affect the SCC of the simulated HAZ microstructures because of the high binding energy and low cohesive strength [1,2,5]. Compared with CGHAZ, FGHAZ has more grain boundaries and are the main crack initiation sites. It has been pointed out in the literature that grain boundaries have higher energies than the bulk, so FGHAZ is more chemically active, and that a high density of grain boundaries increase the reactivity of the surface through increased electron activity and diffusion [38]. Grain refinement has a certain resistance to crack propagation [22,39]. The grain boundary also is the stumbling block of crack propagation, when the crack is perpendicular to the grain boundary [3,59,60]. Han et al. [56] reported that the large-angle grain boundary of X100 pipeline steel could prevent the diffusion of hydrogen to the crack tip, improving the resistance to hydrogen-induced cracking and reducing the SSC susceptibility. When H content is high, hydrogen concentration and hydrogen pressure at the grain boundary are relatively high, resulting in instantaneous cracking along the grain boundary. This has a huge impact on SCC, making the susceptibility of FGHAZ is greater than CGHAZ [35]. However, compared with FGHAZ, the grain boundary of CGHAZ was less, and the content of pinning H was less. The granular bainite content in the CGHAZ was less, so the CGHAZ was more uniform. The SCC susceptibility of CGHAZ was lower than that of FGHAZ in the environment with a high concentration of H, and the cracking was mainly along with the crystal. As for the phase boundary, the phase interface is also a defect. There are more H pins here, which will lead to stress concentration under the action of tensile stress. For example, due to the soft texture of ferrite and the hard M-A island, ICHAZ has uneven deformation feature under tensile stress, resulting in high dislocation slip resistance. The M-A islands in ICHAZ have strong hydrogen trapping properties [22]. In general, the structure has good toughness, so the phase boundary has a certain resistance to crack growth. However, in the environment with a high hydrogen concentration, more hydrogen was pinned at the phase boundary and there were more crack initiation sites, leading to a large number of cracks occurring at the phase boundary and a high hydrogen pressure, making SCC more sensitive than FGHAZ and CGHAZ."
13,Conclusion,"The combined effect of sulfur species and cathodic potential on electrochemical corrosion, hydrogen permeation, and stress corrosion cracking of E690 steel and the simulated HAZ microstructures in modified artificial seawater have been investigated in the present work. The following conclusions are obtained: (1) S2O3 2− promotes the corrosion rate, hydrogen penetration, and SCC susceptibility of various microstructures, and the fracture mechanism is controlled by AD and HE. In the deaerated, acidified ASWs with thiosulfate, the applied cathodic potential further promotes hydrogen permeation and greatly increases SCC susceptibility. The fracture mechanism is dominated by HE. (2) The SCC susceptibility in ASWs at OCP, decreases with the following order CGHAZ > FGHAZ > ICHAZ. In the deaerated, acidified ASW with thiosulfate at −850 mVSCE, the SCC susceptibility of ICHAZ is the highest for the simulated HAZ microstructures. (3) Grain boundary and phase boundary are all defects, which are the sites of pinning H and crack initiation. When the crack propagation direction is perpendicular to the grain boundary, the crack propagation resistance increases with the increase of grain boundary quantity."
