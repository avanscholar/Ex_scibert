0,Introduction,"Currently, the need for renewable sources of energy is increasing, since our dependence on fossil fuels has caused serious environmental problems, namely atmospheric pollution and the greenhouse effect, and the depletion of natural resources. The use of hydrogen as a fuel could be crucial in the development of a sustainable clean energy technology, since its consumption in fuel cell devices produces only water. However, to support a feasible hydrogen-based economy, it is essential to produce hydrogen cleanly and renewably. Among the various processes used to obtain hydrogen, the steam reforming of natural gas and methanol are the commonest, but these are nonrenewable sources, besides failing to remove the great amounts of CO2 emitted in the reaction. From an environmental point of view, the reforming of ethanol is an interesting alternative, because this alcohol can be a renewable raw material, which can easily be derived from biomass, and the carbon dioxide produced in the reforming process is then consumed in biomass growth, thus completing a nearly closed carbon cycle. Moreover, ethanol has other advantages, such as low toxicity, storage and a handling safety, and a relatively high hydrogen content, described by reaction (1) [1]: (1) C2H5OH+3H2O→6H2 +2CO2 Ethanol steam reforming comprises several catalytic steps, which depend on the nature of the catalyst [2–8]. Such reaction pathways include dehydration, decomposition and dehydrogenation of ethanol to form ethylene, methane (or acetone) and acetaldehyde, respectively, besides the water-gas shift reaction (WGSR) and methanation reaction [1]. Additionally, the undesirable formation of coke can occur by the decomposition of methane, ethylene polymerization or the Boudouard reaction. Coke deposition on the catalyst surface is the main reason for the deactivation of catalysts over time, which limits their industrial application. In a number of different studies, various metal catalysts (Ni [2], Co [3,4], Ni–Cu [5], Pt, Pd, Rh [6–8] supported on metal oxides (Al2O3, La2O3, ZnO, MgO, etc. [9]) have proved to be suitable for the ethanol steam reforming reaction. Among the transition metals, Ni has exhibited catalytic activities comparable to those of the noble metals. Its high selectivity toward hydrogen production combined with a relatively low cost makes it an appropriate active phase for practical use. However, Ni-based catalysts suffer from deactivation by coking and sintering more severely than the noble metal-based catalysts, shortening their lifetime. Nevertheless, it is possible to counter these shortcomings by modifying the catalyst by adding metal promoters. Several groups have reported the use of Ni-based catalysts modified by promoters for methane reforming, but their use in ethanol steam reforming is rare. In a recent study Soyal-Baltacıoglu et al. [10] investigated the ethanol reforming on catalysts having 0.2–0.3wt.% Pt and 10–15wt.% Ni contents. It was found that the best ethanol steam reforming performance was achieved over 0.3wt.% Pt–15wt.% Ni/δ-Al2O3. Vizcaíno et al. [11] investigated the ethanol steam reforming on Ni catalysts promoted by Mg. It was found that the addition of Mg promoter improved the catalytic performance of the nickel species and decreased the catalyst deactivation. Moreover, an important reduction in the amount of deposited coke due to inhibition of ethanol dehydration towards ethylene was observed. The effect of the addition of cobalt on the catalytic performance of Ni catalyst in the steam reforming of ethanol was measured by Resini et al. [12]. The authors observed that the addition of Co resulted in the inhibition of the dehydration reaction as well as of methane production. The effect of the promoters Ce, Co, Cu, Mg and Zn on the catalytic performance of Ni catalyst in the auto-thermal reforming of ethanol was investigated by Youn et al. [13]. The authors observed that the Cu was the most efficient promoter for the production of hydrogen; mainly due to the Cu species were also active in the WGSR. Furthermore, the Cu decreased the interaction between Ni-species and γ-Al2O3, facilitating the reduction of Ni-Cu/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. It was found that the addition of small amounts of noble metals caused a significant increase in the catalytic activity of Ni for methane reforming reactions. Dias and Assaf [14–16] studied the effect of introducing small amounts of Pt, Pd and Ir into Ni/Al2O3 catalysts for the autothermal reforming of methane, with the aim of making the reaction ignite without previous reduction of the catalyst with H2. It was concluded that the samples promoted with palladium nitrate were very active in the auto-thermal reforming of methane, and this was attributed to expansion of the metal surface. On the other hand, the characteristic of the supports may influence drastically the catalytic activity of the Ni-based catalysts. This influence depends on the chemical and textural property of the support, and is related to the stability and dispersion of the metal; besides, the support participates in the reforming reaction. The selection and modification of an appropriate support for a nickel catalyst, therefore, is potentially a way to improve the catalytic performance of a supported nickel catalyst. The support often used in reforming reactions is alumina, chosen for its mechanical and chemical resistance under reaction conditions, combined with its high surface area. However, in the case of the ethanol steam reforming reaction, the acidic sites of the γ-Al2O3 favor ethanol dehydration and, consequently, the formation of undesirable reaction byproducts, such as ethylene, which then undergoes polymerization to form coke [1,9]. Additionally, the use of alumina-based catalysts at high working temperatures leads to unwanted phase transitions, sintering of the active metal and the formation of an inactive metal–aluminate phase. In order to overcome these limitations, additives based on rare-earth elements are used to diminish the acid character of the γ-Al2O3, as well as to improve the metal dispersion and to prevent the sintering of the active metal. Researches have described the effect produced by the addition of lanthanum as remarkable [17–20]. Martinez et al. [17] investigated the influence of lanthanum oxide added to a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst on the carbon dioxide reforming of methane. The authors observed that the presence of La increased the metal dispersion, increased conversion levels, and also enhanced the catalyst stability by significantly decreasing in coke formation during the reaction. Liberatori et al. [18] investigated the catalytic behavior of Ni/Al2O3 catalysts modified with La and Ag in the steam reforming of ethanol. They found that the addition of La decreased the coking on Ni catalysts during the steam reforming of ethanol and promoted the selectivity to hydrogen. This resistance to coke deposition on the catalyst was attributed to the formation of lanthanum oxycarbonate, which reacts with surface carbon to form CO and regenerate La2O3. Ethanol steam reforming was studied by Sánchez-Sánchez et al. [19] on alumina-supported nickel catalysts modified with Ce, Mg, Zr and La. Among these supports, the La2O3–Al2O3 showed the highest metal dispersion. The same authors also studied ethanol steam reforming on nickel catalysts supported on Al2O3 modified with various amounts of lanthanum [20]. The results revealed an enhancement in the stability of the Ni catalysts during reforming, with rising lanthanum loading on Al2O3, probably due to the enhanced ability of the nickel surface and/or La–Ni interactions to prevent the formation of carbon species. Although several articles exist on promoted Ni/Al2O3 catalyst for methane reforming, the effect of adding noble metals to nickel catalysts on ethanol reforming has not been investigated in detail. Thus, the idea of the present study was to develop an alternative catalyst, based on Ni/La2O3-Al2O3 promoted with noble metals, for the ethanol steam reforming reaction, aiming at hydrogen production for fuel cell applications. These catalysts might combine the properties of nickel promoted with small amounts of noble metal in reducing the formation of CO, with the properties of the La2O3-Al2O3 support, in reducing the ethene and coke formation."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The La2O3-Al2O3 mixed oxide support was synthesized by impregnating γ-Al2O3 (Degussa) with La(NO3)3·6H2O (Aldrich). The alumina was calcined beforehand for 5h at 550°C in order to stabilize the phase and eliminate surface impurities. A known amount of the nitrate precursor was dissolved in water and the γ-Al2O3 was added to the solution under continuous stirring. The slurry was heated to 70°C in a rotavapor and maintained at that temperature until nearly all the water had evaporated. The solid residue was dried at 90°C overnight and then calcined at 550°C for 5h under flowing air (30cm3 min−1). The La2O3 content of the support was 8% by mass. The support was then impregnated with the Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Aldrich) aqueous solution, followed by the drying and calcination procedures already described. The same method was also used to add the noble metals on the Ni/La2O3-Al2O3 catalysts, using PdCl2 (Aldrich) and H2PtCl6 (Aldrich) solutions and annealing at 600°C. The nominal metal loading for these catalysts was 15wt.% for Ni and 0.1 and 0.3wt.% for Pd and Pt, respectively. The catalysts were labeled as follows: Ni/LaAl, Ni0.1Pd/LaAl, Ni0.1Pt/LaAl, Ni0.3Pd/LaAl, Ni0.3Pt/LaAl."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The chemical composition of the catalysts was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP–AES), using a PerkinElmer Optima 3300DV apparatus. The samples were first dissolved in acid solutions (a mixture of HF, HCl and HNO3), and diluted to concentrations within the detection range of the instrument. The surface areas of the catalysts were measured in a Quantachrome Nova 2.0 gas adsorption analyzer. The samples were previously outgassed at 300°C for 2h. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained at 77K and the specific areas were calculated from these isotherms using the Brunauer–Emett–Teller (BET) method. The crystalline structures of the catalysts were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) performed on a Rigaku Multiflex diffractometer using a CuKα radiation source. The X-ray diffractograms were collected for 2θ values ranging from 10° to 80°. The apparent size of nickel oxide particles was calculated by the Scherrer's formula, L =0.9λ/β 2θ cos θ max, where λ is the X-ray wavelength (1.54056Å for the CuKα radiation), β 2θ is the width of the NiO diffraction peak at half-height, and θ max is the Bragg angle at the peak maximum position. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was carried out in a Varian Cary 5G UV–vis/NIR spectrophotometer equipped with a diffuse reflectance accessory in the range of 200–800nm. The Kubelka–Munk function F(R) was calculated using barium sulphate as the reference material. The incorporation of the noble metals on the nickel catalysts was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA), which were performed in a Mettler Toledo (TGA/SDTA851e) thermobalance. A sample of 20mg was heated at 10°Cmin−1 to 1000°C under flowing air (100cm3 min−1). The positive peaks in the TGA curves are related to the exothermic process. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were performed with 25mg catalyst in a quartz U-shaped tube reactor in a Micromeritics Pulse Chemisorb 2705, subjected to a temperature ramp from 35 to 1000°C at 10°Cmin−1. The sample was reduced with 2% H2 in argon, flowing at 30cm3 min−1. A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was employed to determine the amount of hydrogen consumed. In situ H2-TPR/X-ray absorption fine structure (XANES) studies were performed by dispersive-geometry X-ray absorption spectroscopy at D06A-DXAS beam-line of the Laboratório Nacional Luz Síncrotron (LNLS). A Si(111) monochromator was used to select the energy, and the beam was focused at the sample position. The experimental setup has been described in more detail by Meneses et al. [21] and consists of a compact furnace with halogen lamps as heater elements and a quartz tube sample chamber with ends closed with aluminium flanges sealed by Kapton windows. The catalyst sample was fixed in a stainless steel holder placed in the center of the quartz tube, and positioned relatively to the beam by fine adjustment of the position of the table. The reactor was purged with He for more than 30min at 30cm3 min−1, then the reactant gas (H2/N2, 5%) flowed through the samples (30cm3 min−1) and a temperature ramp of 10°Cmin−1 was applied by the furnace. The Ni K-edge spectra were recorded in transmission mode and collected in the CCD detector with 15ms of time exposure and 50 accumulations for each edge. A Ni foil spectrum was measured for energy calibration. The spectra for each sample were collected in the photon energy range from 8200 to 8550eV."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests The reforming reaction was conducted in a fixed-bed reactor of a quartz tube with inner diameter 13mm at atmospheric pressure. A thermocouple was located inside the reactor tube, near of the catalyst bed. Prior to the catalytic reaction, the 150mg of catalyst was reduced at 700°C with H2 flowing at 30cm3 min−1 for 1h. After this activation of the catalyst, the ethanol and water (1:4) mixture was pumped into the reactor at a flow rate of 2.5cm3 h−1. Before entering the reactor, the mixture was preheated at 180°C. Condensable products (ethanol, acetaldehyde, water, acetone, etc.) were trapped at +0.5°C at the reactor outlet and further analyzed by gas chromatography (Hewlett Packard 5890) with a flame ionic detector (FID) and a capillary column HP-FFAP. Gas was periodically sampled and analyzed with an in-line gas chromatograph (Varian, model 3800) equipped with two TCDs, a 13X molecular sieve packed (H2 analyses) and Porapak-N columns (CO2, CO and CH4 analysis). The product distribution was monitored for 6h of reaction. Catalytic activity was evaluated in terms of ethanol conversion, and the products yields are expressed as the ratios of the moles of product to the moles of ethanol supplied. The percent distribution of the gaseous products was also calculated as follows: (4) D ( % ) = M P M Σ P × 100 where M P is the number of moles of each product, and M ΣP is the sum of the number of moles of all gaseous products. The mass of coke deposited was measured by weighing the reactor containing the catalyst before and after the reaction and calculating the gain in mass."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization The chemical composition and the textural properties (surface area, pore volume, average pore diameter) of the supports and the catalysts are listed in Table 1 . As can be seen, the surface area and the pore volume of Al2O3 were reduced after the incorporation of La2O3, indicating introduction of La2O3 particles into the pores of Al2O3. In the unpromoted catalysts, deposition of Ni on La2O3-Al2O3 caused a slight decrease in the specific surface, which dropped from 129 to 114m2 g−1. However, the surface area of the nickel catalyst increased after the deposition of the noble metal, whereas the pore volume remains unaltered, indicating that the metal promoters combined with the nickel particles contributed to the specific surface area. The chemical compositions of the catalysts, measured by ICP, showed general agreement between the theoretical and experimental compositions, indicating that the experimental method was appropriate for the synthesis of the catalysts. In order to confirm the identity of nickel species, DRS was used to study the symmetry and coordination of the surface species of the catalysts. Results for the catalysts and the support are shown in Fig. 1 , where the Kubelka–Munk functions of the corresponding bands are plotted as a function of the wavelength. The DRS profiles showed an intense signal in the region between 205 and 375nm, which may be related to the NiO charge-transfer band [13]. According to the literature, these absorption bands are usually ascribed to charge transfer of octahedral Ni2+ species in NiO lattices [22]. It is known that the high-temperature treatment leads to the dispersion of NiO particles and an inactive NiAl2O4 phase can be formed, which is highly undesirable due to the low reducibility of nickel in aluminate compounds. Thus, the DRS measurements can be a very useful way of checking the interaction between nickel and alumina support, since the NiAl2O4 spectrum differs considerably from that of NiO. The nickel aluminate can be described as a partial inverse spinel, where the Ni(II) ions occupy both octahedral and tetrahedral sites in the oxygen lattice, and show characteristic absorption bands in the range 600–645nm [23,24]. As can be seen, in the present results (Fig. 1) no peaks assigned to nickel aluminate species were found, either for the promoted or the unpromoted nickel catalysts. These results agree with the TPR results (see below), where no reduction peak at high temperature (above 800°C) assigned to nickel aluminate was observed. The crystalline phases present in the Ni/LaAl and NiM/LaAl catalysts investigated by X-ray diffraction analysis. The XRD patterns of these catalysts are presented in Fig. 2 . All samples showed diffraction lines characteristic of the poorly crystalline γ-Al2O3 support (at ∼37°, 46° and 67° – JCPDS 46-1131), but no peaks attributed to the La2O3 phases were detected. A similar behavior has been observed elsewhere with La2O3-Al2O3 supported catalysts, where only diffractions peaks corresponding to alumina phases are obtained [25,26]. The presence of NiO was confirmed by the diffraction peaks located at 2θ =43.3°, 63.7° and 75.5° (JCPDS 44-1159). The broadened NiO peaks observed for all samples suggest that the sample is not highly crystallized, as well as being due to either the formation of well-dispersed Ni species or the existence of small NiO particles. Similar XRD patterns were obtained for the promoted catalysts, indicating that no new phase was formed by the incorporation of the noble metals. In the diffractograms it is difficult to identify the formation of NiAl2O4, since in the broadened XRD patterns, the signals from nickel spinel and γ-A12O3, having very similar crystal lattices, overlap. The average crystal particle size was calculated from X-ray diffractograms by the Scherrer's equation using the NiO diffraction peak at 2θ =43.3°. Table 1 show that values vary between 13nm for Ni/LaAl and 17–26nm for the promoted catalysts. Hence, the second thermal treatment for the incorporation of noble metal provoked crystallization and crystal growth, thus enlarging the particles. The TGA and DTA analyses were performed in order to determine the Pt and Pd species formed during calcinations. Fig. 3a shows the TGA and DTA analyses of the calcined Ni/LaAl catalyst, where only a small weight loss occurred between 400 and 800°C, probably due to the elimination of some adsorbed water and further crystallization of the NiO particles. The thermogravimetric analyses of the promoted catalysts were performed soon after the impregnation of the Pt and Pd precursors. Fig. 3b and c shows the TGA–DTA of Ni0.1Pt/LaAl and Ni0.3Pt/LaAl, respectively. Three decomposition stages were observed, which take place in the temperature range 200–800°C. According to Radivojević et al. [27], these three steps are related to the decomposition of the Pt precursor (H2PtCl6·6H2O) in oxidizing atmosphere following the reactions: (2) H2PtCl6·6H2O→PtCl4 +2HCl+6H2O (3) PtCl4 →PtCl2 +Cl2 (4) PtCl2 →Pt+Cl2 Simultaneously recorded DTA curves show that all these losses correspond to exothermic peaks. Additionally, PtO x species may be formed at higher temperatures under air flow and may also be accompanied by some crystallization, resulting in exothermic processes [27]. Fig. 3d and e shows the TGA–DTA curves of Ni0.1Pd/LaAl and Ni0.3Pd/LaAl, respectively. Two stages of weight loss occurred from 200 to 450°C, which correspond to exothermic peaks. This loss is probably related to the thermal decomposition of PdCl2, in analogous processes to these described for the platinum precursors, and the formation of an oxide phase (PdO) [28]. After these results were obtained, the calcination process for noble metal incorporation was performed at 600°C. Fig. 4 shows the TPR profiles of supported Ni catalysts. The reduction pattern of the Ni/LaAl catalyst may be divided into four regions. According to published studies, the peak temperature for pure NiO reduction is about 325°C [17]. Hence, the low temperature reduction peak at around 400°C can be assigned to the reduction of NiO species interacting weakly with the alumina support [29]. The broad high-temperature reduction peaks above 500°C could be due to the reduction of a well-dispersed and possibly amorphous NiO phase that interacts strongly with the support [17]. Moreover, it is known that the addition of lanthanum to Al2O3 by the impregnation method can hinder the reduction of the NiO, owing to an increase in the proportion of highly dispersed nickel species (peak at ∼630°C) and a concomitant decrease in the proportion of nickel with interacting weakly with the support (peak at ∼540°C), compared to those catalysts prepared without lanthanum. This increase in the reduction temperature is related to the presence of nickel in a surface phase containing Ni, Al, and La, in which nickel interaction is higher [17]. Additionally, the peak at ∼880°C may be attributed to the reduction of a stable nickel species [14]. In the catalysts promoted with Pd, three well-defined regions of NiO reduction were observed. The initial reduction temperature was decreased slightly from 465°C (Ni/LaAl) to about 418°C and the area of this reduction peak was increased, whereas the area of the peaks located at higher temperatures was decreased. These results indicate that the amount of reducible Ni species was increased, and the addition of the Pd facilitated the reduction of the species interacting strongly with the support. Furthermore, the amount of Pd added also influenced the degree of reduction, as can be observed by comparing the increase in the area related to the first reduction process (at 418°C) for the Ni0.3Pd/LaAl with that of Ni0.1Pd/LaAl. The reduction profiles of the Pt-promoted catalysts showed four well-defined regions of NiO reduction, and the area of the second peak increased significantly. The decrease of the temperature of the NiO reduction, seen in the TPR curves of the promoted catalysts, may result from a hydrogen spillover phenomenon that occurs in noble metals [30–32]. On the promoted catalysts, the hydrogen is first dissociated on the reduced noble metal clusters, forming active hydrogen, which can migrate and reduce the neighboring nickel oxide clusters. These results indicate that the presence of noble metal facilitates the reduction of nickel species. This behavior may be confirmed by the TPR-XANES analysis, where we can follow the trajectory of the chemical reactions occurring during the reduction experiment. In this case, the pre-edge peak intensity and white line intensity are considered the main characteristics for monitoring the reduction of the nickel species. The Ni K-edge XANES spectra for Ni/LaAl catalysts monitored during the reduction process are shown in Fig. 5 . For all samples, the first spectrum at room temperature resembles that of NiO (Fig. 6 ), with a high intensity of the white line, caused by the Ni–O interaction [33]. The appearing of a pre-edge is also observed, which is due to the forbidden dipole and allowed quadrupole transitions from the Ni 1s orbitals to Ni 3d orbital [34]. As the temperature is increased under reducing conditions, the intensity of the white line decreases and the spectra assume a similar profile to the Ni foil spectrum (Fig. 6), showing that Ni2+ is converted to Ni0. Fig. 5a shows that the reduction of the Ni/LaAl catalyst begins at 550°C, where a slightly decrease in the intensity of the white line is observed. A shift of the absorption edge energy towards lower values is also observed in the course of the reaction, as it assumes the photon energy values characteristic of metallic Ni [33]. The addition of the noble metals to the Ni catalyst caused a marked modification of the Ni K-edge XANES spectra from 400°C, corroborating the TPR results for the promoted samples. Fig. 5b shows the evolution of the reduction reaction of the Ni0.3Pd/LaAl catalyst and the white line intensity is seen to drop from 350°C, followed by the shift in the absorption edge, whereas the Ni/LaAl catalyst was reduced at higher temperatures. The spectra of the other promoted catalysts are similar to that of the Ni0.3Pd/LaAl catalyst and not shown for the sake of brevity. Therefore, in Fig. 7 the variation of the white line intensity with rising temperature is shown for all samples and it is clear that the noble metals catalyze the reduction of the nickel species. This enhancement of reducibility may be closely related to the improved catalytic performances of the promoted catalysts, as seen below."
7,Catalytic tests,"3.2 Catalytic tests The catalytic activity of the Ni/LaAl catalysts for the ethanol steam-reforming reaction was studied between 450 and 600°C at atmospheric pressure. From the analysis of the exit gases, it appears that hydrogen is the main component of the reaction products, which also include CO, CO2 and CH4. Some acetaldehyde was detected in the analyses of the condensable products. No ethylene was formed at any temperature investigated, indicating that the addition of lanthanum to the alumina suppressed the acid sites required for the dehydration of the ethanol. The gaseous product distribution obtained at 600°C, especially with regard to the amounts of CO, CO2 and CH4 produced, is very similar for all catalysts: 60–70% H2, 15–20% CO2, 9–12% CO and 9–12% CH4, as shown in Fig. 8 . This hydrogen yield is close to the value observed by Sánchez-Sánchez et al. [19] in nickel catalysts dispersed on La2O3-Al2O3 supports. Regarding the mechanism of ethanol steam reforming, besides reaction (1), other reactions may occur, taking account of the formation of H2, CO2, CO, CH4, and CH3CHO, by partial ethanol decomposition (reaction (5)), ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde (reaction (6)) and the WGSR (reaction (7)) [1]: (5) C2H5OH→CH4 +CO+H2 (6) C2H5OH→CH3CHO+H2 (7) CO + H 2 O ⇌ H 2 + C O 2 Tables 2 and 3 , respectively, compare the average number of moles of products formed per mole of ethanol supplied and the ethanol conversion, at 450 and 600°C. As can be observed, the ethanol–steam reaction performed at 450 and 600°C showed similar ethanol conversion values, higher values being obtained with the promoted catalysts, irrespective of the noble metal loading. As expected, the production of H2 and CO increased with the increase in temperature, whereas the formation of CO2 and CH4 diminished. The CO enrichment in the gas effluent at higher temperatures may be explained by the reverse WGSR (7), which takes place simultaneously in the reactor. The WGSR is exothermic and the equilibrium shifts to the left at higher temperatures, favoring the formation of CO. This interpretation supported by the higher CO2 formation at 450°C, where the WGSR favored H2 and CO2 production. The decrease in the formation of methane at higher temperatures may be justified by its production being thermodynamically favored at low temperatures, so that the formation of CH4 declines rapidly above 500°C [7]. Additionally, it has been proposed that methane is also formed by methanation of CO (reaction (8)), which is thermodynamically favored at temperatures below 530°C: (8) CO+3H2 →CH4 +H2O The presence of CH4 in the reaction products is undesirable because its production by reaction (5) diminishes the hydrogen yield, compared to reaction (1), and methanation would actually consume H2 [1]. It was expected that the noble metals could cause a decrease in the concentrations of CO in the product stream. However, this promotion effect was not observed. In fact, the CO formation was somewhat higher in the promoted catalysts than in the unpromoted one, probably due to the low catalytic activity for the WGSR found in the Ni catalysts [9], which was not improved by the addition of noble metal. The incorporation of the noble metals in Ni/LaAl catalysts caused only slight differences in the distribution of gaseous products. On the other hand, the effect of the noble metal on catalytic performance is clearly observed in the ethanol conversion values, which are higher for the promoted catalysts, as observed in Table 3. The H2 yield was also enhanced for the promoted catalysts at both 450 and 600°C. More importantly, the production of undesirable byproducts at 450°C, such as acetaldehyde, was significantly suppressed on incorporation of the noble metal (Table 2). Fig. 9 shows the moles of H2 produced per mole of ethanol supplied at 450°C, and it is observed that at the beginning, the H2 production on the Ni/LaAl catalyst is about 2.5mol per mole ethanol, but this decreases progressively to ∼1.8mol after 2h, remaining approximately constant until the end of experiment (∼1.6mol). This behavior indicates that the nickel species undergoes a small deactivation process during the reaction. However, this phenomenon was not observed in the promoted catalysts up to 6h of reaction. Liberatori et al. [18] found that the Ni in La-containing catalysts (15Ni/12La–Al2O3) is highly susceptible to oxidation by water at low temperatures, and the Ni in oxide form is inactive for ethanol steam reforming at low temperature. Thus, it appears that the addition of small amounts of noble metal probably prevents the reoxidation of Ni sites, becoming the Ni/LaAl catalyst less susceptible to the deactivation during the reforming reaction. This beneficial effect is observed for all the promoted catalysts, irrespective of the nature or loading of the noble metal. The slight fall in the H2 production on the Ni/LaAl catalyst may also be attributed to carbon deposition on the surface. Table 3 indicates the rate of the carbon formation (mmolh−1) for all catalysts, measured by the amount of coke recovered at the end of each reaction. It is evident that another effect of the noble metal is a considerable decrease in coke formation on the promoted catalysts at both temperatures studied (Table 3). The coke may be formed by decomposition of CH4 (reaction (9)), polymerization of C2H4 or Boudouard reaction (reaction (10)) [1]: (9) CH4 →2H2 +C (10) CO2 →O2 +C In the case of these catalysts, the production of ethylene was clearly inhibited on La2O3-Al2O3-supported catalysts, since it was not found as a by-product. Thus, these results suggest that carbonaceous species were probably formed by methane decomposition or the Boudouard reaction, which occur less extensively on the promoted catalysts. Although some coke accumulated in the reactor over time, the product composition remained relatively constant throughout the reaction for the promoted catalysts, confirming that the contribution of these small amounts of noble metals on the Ni/LaAl catalysts is not only to increase the performance, but also stabilize the metallic state of Ni and thus preserve the catalytic activity. In summary, for ethanol steam reforming at 450 and 600°C, the promoted catalysts showed higher H2 production and higher ethanol conversion. These results demonstrated that the supported-Ni promoted catalysts are suitable materials for hydrogen production by ethanol steam reforming, but that CO selectivity must be reduced for fuel cell applications. Further studies related to the minimizing of CO formation are in progress."
8,Conclusions,"NiM/LaAl (M=Pd, Pt) catalysts with two different noble metal contents (0.1 and 0.3wt.%) were prepared by the impregnation method and applied to hydrogen production by ethanol steam reforming. The effects on the properties and catalytic activity of the NiM/LaAl were investigated. Results of TPR and TPR-XANES analyses showed that significant changes occur in the oxidation states of Ni due to the addition of noble metals. The addition of small amounts of the promoter metals caused a decrease in the reduction temperature of NiO, owing to a hydrogen spillover effect. Experimental tests of ethanol steam reforming showed that the Ni/LaAl promoted catalysts produced a hydrogen-rich gas mixture. In the experiments performed at 450°C, the Ni/LaAl catalyst showed lower H2 formation and higher acetaldehyde production than the promoted catalysts. Moreover, the bimetallic catalysts showed a higher ethanol conversion and higher hydrogen yield than the Ni/LaAl catalyst, irrespective of the nature or concentration of the noble metal."
