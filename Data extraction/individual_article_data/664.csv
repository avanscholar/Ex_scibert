0,Introduction,"Furfural is an abundant, biomass-derived aldehyde that can be hydrogenated to multiple value-added chemicals. In mono-metal systems sequential hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis steps generate furfuryl alcohol (FA), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), 2-methylfuran (2MF) and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2MTHF) [1]. In an aqueous environment, cyclopentanone (CP) and 5-hydroxy-2-pentanone (5H2P) are two other valuable products of furfural hydrogenation derived from FA [2-5]. With one further hydrogenation step of 5H2P, 1,4-pentanediol, an important linear diol for controlled drug delivery, cosmetics industry and polymer fabrication, is achieved [5,6]. Cyclopentanone formation requires Piancattelli ring rearrangement of FA, opening into an unstable intermediate in the presence of a weak acid and rearranging to 4-hydroxy-2-cyclopentenone (4HCP) [7,8]. Water can promote the furfural ring opening/rearrangement step since it can act as an H+ donor [8,9]. Further hydrogenation of 4HCP results in CP. In another pathway from FA in the presence of an acid catalyst, an unstable intermediate is formed in which a CC bond is hydrogenated to form 4-oxopentanal, and upon further hydrogenation results in 5H2P [3,10]. Although a mono-metal system, recently a Pd/CNT catalyst was indicated to have two active sites (Pdo for H2 dissociative adsorption and Pdζ+ as a Bronsted or Lewis acid site) [10]. Furfuryl alcohol, formed from furfural hydrogenation (Pdo), in the presence of H2O activated by Pdζ+ undergoes Piancatelli rearrangement to cyclopentanone and 4-oxopentanal via hydrogenation of an unstable intermediate [10] . Better control of the reaction pathways in an aqueous environment can be obtained by design of multi-functional catalysts. Multifunctional catalysts usually offer two or more active sites where each active site plays a role in the reaction system; e.g., each site may promote a different step of the pathway. Metal-acid and bimetal catalysts are two multifunctional catalysts of interest in hydrogenation of furfural [1]. Several studies have investigated the application of metal–acid catalysts for furfural ring rearrangement. Au metal on TiO2 selectively hydrogenated furfural to cyclopentanone in water (160 °C, 4 MPa) with TiO2 providing Lewis acid sites and promoting the Piancatelli rearrangement [11]. Similarly, Au on Nb2O5 produced primarily 3-hydroxymethylcyclopentanone (a cyclopentanone derivative) from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural [12]. Pt/SiO2 promoted with metal oxides (e.g., TiO2) produced 3-hydroxymethylcyclopentanone from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural [13]. Primarily cyclopentanone was produced from furfural hydrogenation using ruthenium on MIL-101 (a metal–organic framework with Lewis acid sites) [14]. Weak acid sites in a Ru on mesoporous carbon, combined with an aqueous, acidic environment were recently implicated in the formation of 5-hydroxy-2-pentanone (5H2P) and 1,4-pentanediol from furfural [6]. Similarly, a combination of metal and weak acid sites on a Pd/TiO2/Activated Carbon catalyst produced 5H2P under continuous conditions [15]. Bimetallic catalysts have also been used to alter selectivity in furfural hydrogenations. Bimetallic catalysts can provide two different metal active sites promoting hydrogen adsorption at one site and CO adsorption at the second site. In a Cu-Pd on carbon catalyst the Cu sites were indicated to adsorb furfural at the CO group and H2 dissociated on Pd [16]. Selective hydrogenation of furfural to THFA occurred using Ni-Cu/CNT, yet the mono-metal Ni was selective towards furfuryl alcohol [17]. A Pd-Re/Al2O3 catalyst generated higher activity and selectivity for furfuryl alcohol than Pd/Al2O3 [18]. A Ni-Cu/SBA-15 catalyst enhanced cyclopentanone selectivity and furfural conversion (160 °C,4 MPa) compared to the mono-metal Ni/SBA-15 [9]. Rearrangement of the furan ring occurred from furfuryl alcohol. Similarly, a carbon supported Pd-Cu catalyst was selective for hydrogenation of furfural to cyclopentanone in water [19]. Recently, Ni-Co bimetal catalysts on SBA-15 reduced decarbonylation and hydrogenolysis steps to selectively produce tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol from furfural [20]. Adding Fe to Pd significantly increases furfural turnover frequency in aqueous phase hydrogenations and reduces Pd leaching [21-23]. Recently, a NiSn bimetal catalyst was shown to produce 1,4-pentanediol from furfural in an ethanol/water mixture [24]. The NiSn contained acid sites with a balance of weak, medium and strong acid sites. It was proposed that 2-methylfuran, generated from furfural, undergoes hydrolysis via an acid site, forming 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran with subsequent tautomerism forming 5H2P [24]. Overall, bimetal systems increase hydrogenation activity, reduce ring hydrogenation or decarbonylation and hydrogenolysis in the furfural reaction pathway, and stabilize the active metal, relative to mono-metals. Continuous processing of renewable platform chemicals has many advantages [25-29]. However, very few studies have investigated the development of kinetic models for furfural hydrogenation, especially under aqueous phase and continuous conditions [30-40]. A kinetic model or rate law for furfural hydrogenation is an important step in a path to scale-up for industrial processes. Continuous furfural hydrogenation has been reported for mono-metals on carbon (e.g., Ni, Cu, Pd, Pt) with a range of solvents (both liquid and vapor phase), with Pd-Cu/silica under vapor phase conditions, a Pd-Fe on mesoporous silica bi-metal, and Pd and Ru on TiO2 or SiO2 in the vapor phase with water added [30-40]. Only the group using the Pd-Cu/silica catalyst developed a kinetic model based on a single-site Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism to describe the vapor phase furfural reaction rates [30]. In early work using Cu chromite and vapor phase hydrogenation of furfural, a single-site Langmuir Hinshelwood (LH) mechanism involving H2 dissociative adsorption and furfural binding fit the kinetic data [33]. Subsequently, a Cu/Carbon catalyst indicated a dual site LH mechanism (Cuo for H2 dissociation, Cu+ for binding –CO) fit the vapor phase furfural hydrogenation rates [34]. Using Pt/Carbon in liquid phase furfural hydrogenation (2-propanol as solvent) a dual site LH mechanism where one site molecularly adsorbs H2 and the other binds furfural adequately fit the kinetic data [35]. Work with Ru/TiO2 or Ir/TiO2 for furfural and furfuryl alcohol hydrogenation indicated a single site LH mechanism fit the kinetic data and the Eley-Rideal mechanism gave negative kinetic parameters [36,37]. A single site LH mechanism (H2 dissociative binding and furfural adsorption) was found to fit furfural vapor hydrogenation rates and predict furfuryl alcohol and 2-methylfuran profiles and associated parameters using a Cu/SiO2 catalyst [38]. More recently, a Cu-Co/Al2O3 catalyst was indicated to have metal and acid sites resulting in a dual-site LH mechanism that adequately fit the furfural hydrogenation kinetic data (conducted in 2-propanol) [39]. Here the Cu-Co metal site was assumed to dissociatively adsorb H2 and the acid site binds –CO in furfural. It was also proposed that the acid site promoted hydrogenolysis of furfuryl alcohol to 2-methylfuran [39]. In a majority of the kinetic studies, either vapor phase reactions or reactions in solvents other than water were conducted, H2 was assumed to be dissociatively adsorbed, a surface reaction was rate limiting, and only the rate of furfural hydrogenation was predicted (except for Sitthisa et al., 2011) [39]. To the best of our knowledge, multi-step kinetic analysis of furfural hydrogenation in aqueous phase systems has not been conducted. Thus, the goal of this work was to develop a kinetic model for furfural hydrogenation and product formation in an aqueous environment for a metal–acid on activated carbon catalyst."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Furfural (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) was stored at 4 °C and solutions prepared using deionized water and 45 g L−1 aqueous furfural were prepared for each reaction. Activated carbon monoliths were supplied by Applied Catalysts (Laurens, SC) and manufactured by coextrusion of 50% activated carbon and 50% ceramic binder [40,41]. The monoliths were cores with a diameter and length of 1 in [2.54 cm] and 529 cells/in2 or 82 cells/cm2 (wall thickness of 0.01 in [0.0254 cm], cell spacing of 0.0435 in [0.11049 cm], a geometric surface area of 70.84 in2/in3 [28 cm2/cm3] and an open frontal area of 0.593 in2 [3.826 cm2]). From this material, catalysts were synthesized to eliminate external and internal mass transfer resistance, anticipating the resultant intrinsic hydrogenation kinetic model could be used to predict concentration profiles in monolith forms."
3,Metal-Acid system,"2.2 Metal-Acid system Each monolith structure was crushed and sieved to a particle size of 0.25 < dp < 0.320 mm (noted as Pd-TiO2/C-k) and 0.5 < dp < 1 mm (Pd-TiO2/C-d). To prepare 0.8% Pd-5% TiO2 catalyst, a direct air-hydrolysis method was employed to deposit TiO2 particles on activated carbon support [15]. Titanium (IV) isopropoxide (Sigma-Aldrich at 99.999% and 2.19 g) was dissolved in isopropanol (6 ml) under nitrogen atmosphere and added to crushed activated carbon monolith (7 g) while stirring. The sample then was dried (120 °C, 2 h) and calcined (300 °C, 100% N2 at 100 ml/min, 4 h). Subsequently, an incipient wetness impregnation method was employed to deposit Pd particles on the catalyst [15] and then dried at 120 °C for 2 h followed by reduction at 250 °C under 100% flow of H2 (100 ml/min) for 4 h inside the reactor before runs were conducted."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Surface area, pore size, and micropore analysis were performed as previously described [40]. Ammonia-TPD analysis was performed to determine the quantity and strength of acid sites as previously described [15,40,41]. TPR analysis was performed to determine the reducibility of the catalysts and CO pulse titration was performed to determine the CO uptake of Pd at 40 °C [15,40,41]. Elemental analysis of fresh and spent catalysts was performed following the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ICP method 200.8. Concentrated HNO3 was added (5 ml) to the sample (~0.1 g) formicrowave digestion following protocols listed in EPA method 3051A. Digested solutions were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Spectro Arcos FHS16 AMETEK ICP-OES). For Ti analysis, ICP-MS was used, and the samples were digested with hydrofluoric acid. Scanning Electron Microscopy / Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) was performed using a FEI TENEO instrument with a 150 mm Oxford XMaxN detector at 10 kV (Georgia Electron Microscopy, Athens, Ga). XPS analysis was conducted using a Kratos Axis Ultra XPS/UPS instrument (Al-K alpha source, 400 um spot size, 1.0 eV step size, 200.0 eV pass energy, 1361 energy steps) at the Southeastern Nanotechnology Infrastructure Corridor (SENIC, Atlanta Ga). XPS analysis was performed on the base support (crushed ACM) [40], a Pd/ACM [40], and the Pd-Ti/C materials without H2 pre-reduction (i.e., catalysts were analyzed as received or prepared)."
5,Analytical,"2.4 Analytical Product liquid samples were analyzed in triplicate using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID, HP 5890 Series II) with HP Innowax column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 mm) [40]. The presence of all intermediates and products were confirmed using GC/MS (HP-6890 with HP Innowax column, same method as for GC/FID, 1 μl injection volume, 25:1 split ratio, 0.8 ml/min, 10–500 mass units, MSD ChemStation D.03.00.611 with NIST 2008 database for identification)."
6,Catalytic reactions,"2.5 Catalytic reactions Furfural hydrogenation reactions were performed in a continuous reactor system (PBR), designed by Parr Instrument Company, as described previously (stainless-steel tube, 1 in. inner diameter (2.54 cm), Brooks Mass Flow Controller for gas delivery, HPLC pump for furfural delivery, downward flow of both H2 and furfural across the catalyst bed, catalyst located approximately 2–4 in. (5.08–10.16 cm) from the gas/liquid inlet at center of PBR) [40]. Crushed activated carbon monolith catalyst was placed between two layers of quartz wool (2–5 g). To determine the kinetics of furfural hydrogenation, a series of reactions at 180 °C, 300 psig or 2.1 MPa and 100 ml/min H2 flow with different liquid residence times were performed (0.5–6.5 ml/min furfural solution). These reaction conditions were selected since previous work indicated 5H2P and 2MF selectivity and reaction rates increased with temperature and pressure with 180 °C and 2.1 MPa H2 optimum (2MF formation was a much stronger function of temperature and pressure than for 5H2P) [15]."
7,Mass transfer calculations,"2.6 Mass transfer calculations Mears and Wiesz-Prater Criterion were applied to determine if internal and external mass transfer resistance may have affected the kinetic analysis. Continuous hydrogenations in the PBR were treated as a trickle bed reactor. With these catalyst forms we considered external and internal mass transfer as the two major resistances that could account for the differences in observed reaction rates. According to the Mears criterion if the calculated value is<0.15, external mass transfer effects can be neglected (eq. (1)). (1) r furfural ρ b R n k c C furfural < 0.15 where, r is the measured reaction rate of the furfural or H2 (mol g−1 s−1), ρb is the packing density of the catalyst bed (g m−3), R is the catalyst particle radius (in m; in this case we used R = 2.5 × 10−4 m for the Pd-TiO2/C-k and 5.0 × 10−4 m for Pd-TiO2/C-d), n the order of the reaction (we calculated the Mear’s criterion assuming a first order reaction), kc (m s−1) the mass-transfer coefficient shown in eq. (2), DAB the effective diffusivity of the furfural or H2 in water (estimated using equation (3); Wilke and Chang 1955) [42], Re the Reynolds number based on the particle size, Sc the Schmidt number (μ/[ρDAB]), and Cfurfural the bulk liquid phase concentration of the furfural or H2 (mol m−3). (2) k c = 0.266 D AB d p Re 1.15 S c 1 / 3 (3) D AB = 1.17 x - 13 M B ξ 1 / 2 T μ B V A 0.6 where µB is the viscosity of the solvent (centipoise or mPa*s), MB is the molecular weight of the solvent, and ξ is the association factor of the solvent B (2.6 for water). The equation for kc (eq. (2)) was taken from Fogler, 1986 and is applicable for trickle beds with Re < 20 [43,44]. Our Reynolds number ranged from 0.024 to 0.6. The reaction rate for hydrogen was estimated based on the total moles of product (furfuryl alcohol [FA], tetrahydrofufuryl alcohol [THFA], 2-methyl furan [2MF], cyclopentanone [CP], and 5-hydroxy-2-pentanone [5H2P]) produced per mass of catalyst per time. We assumed 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, and 2 mol of H2 were consumed per mole of FA, THFA, 2MTHF, 2MF, CP, and 5H2P. The liquid phase concentration of H2 was estimated using Henry’s Law (H = 8.8 × 10−3 kmol m−3 atm−1 at 230 °C, 14 MPa, experimentally determined) and assuming an ideal gas [45]. The Wiesz-Prater criterion (CWP), eq. (4), was used to estimate the effect of internal mass transfer in the reactions with the catalysts, where a CWP ≪1 indicates that internal (or intraparticle) mass transfer resistance can be ignored. (4) C WP = r furfural ρ p R 2 D eff C furfural , s R is the particle radius (R = dp/2), -r is the reaction rate per gram of catalyst, ρp is the measured catalyst packing density, and Deff is the estimated effective diffusivity (~1.8–9 × 10−10 m2 s−1). The effective diffusivity, eq. (5), was estimated from the diffusion coefficient, the estimated particle porosity (ε = 0.2–0.5), and tortuosity factor (τ ~ 2–6 for activated carbon) [46]. We used a tortuosity factor, τ, of four and ε = 0.5 in our calculations for the catalysts. (5) D eff = D AB ε particle τ particle"
8,Results and discussion,
9,Mechanism development,"3.1 Mechanism development As expected, furfural was rapidly converted to furfuryl alcohol (FA; i.e., there was an increase in FA selectivity at low residence times, which decreased with increasing contact time) for both catalysts leading to different products. Primarily 2-methyl furan (2MF) and 5-hydroxy-2-pentanone (5H2P) were produced and clearly FA was an intermediate in the reaction pathway (Fig. 1 ). In past work, Pd on the ACM alone primarily produced FA, THFA, and 2MF [40], addition of Fe to Pd reduced 2MF production and promoted FA and THFA formation relative to Pd/ACM, and the effect was not as pronounced with Cu [41]. Addition of Ti to Pd on carbon clearly promoted 5H2P formation, yet did not suppress 2MF production (Fig. 1 and Fig. S4). Since it has been suggested that Lewis acid or weak acid sites are required for FA ring opening and rearrangement, the promotion of 5H2P by Ti addition indicates acid sites in combination with metal sites result in 5H2P formation [15]. Ammonia TPD analysis and Pyridine-FTIR indicated weak (150 °C, 50 μmoles NH3/g) and medium strength (300–400 °C, 94 μmoles NH3/g) acid sites, as well as Lewis acid sites on Pd-TiO2/C [15]. XPS analysis also indicated Ti4+ (460 eV, shoulder and 465 eV) [47] and Ti3+ (459 eV) [47], which can act as Lewis acid sites (Fig. 2 ). A shift to lower binding energy was observed for O 1 s when Ti was doped to the Pd/ACM (crushed ACM), suggesting O was more mobile in this catalyst and bound to Ti4+ (relative to Pd/ACM and ACM – Fig. 2) [48]. Oxygen lattice bound to Ti4+ reportedly has a binding energy centered at 531 eV (corresponding to the peak in Pd-Ti/C), whereas hydroxyl groups are indicated at 532 eV and were prevalent in the Pd/ACM and ACM (Fig. 2) [47]. Since the catalysts were reduced at 250 °C the titanium structure was not significantly altered (partial reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ may have occurred, but not complete reduction) [15,49-51], suggesting the XPS results support the concept of Lewis acid sites in the Pd-Ti/C catalysts. H2-TPR analysis of the Pd-TiO2/C-d catalyst indicated that PdO was reduced to Pd at 250 °C in the presence of H2, forming metal sites for hydrogenation activity [15]. As noted in the literature, 5H2P is not formed unless water is present, suggesting water is activated on a catalyst site or attacks an intermediate on an active site from the liquid phase [10]. It has also been reported that at high water density H2O dissociates on TiO2 to form OH– and H+ [52]. These results suggest two active sites in Pd-Ti/C – a metal site responsible for dissociative H2 adsorption and hydrogenation, and an acid site responsible for either protonation and dehydration/hydration and rearrangement or hydroxyl abstraction/hydration/dehydration and rearrangement of FA (Figs. S1 and S2). The formation of 2MF and THFA using the Pd-Ti/C catalyst (Fig. 1) may have been due to a single metal site reaction, since SEM-EDS (Fig. 3 ) and H2-TPD analysis [15] did indicate some Pd segregation from Ti in the Pd-Ti/C-d catalyst. This catalyst was used to develop the concept of a bi-functional, metal–acid catalyst for 5H2P formation."
10,Mass transfer analysis,"3.2 Mass transfer analysis The Mears (external mass transfer) and Weisz-Prater (internal mass transfer) criterion were calculated for the range of flow rates applied in this work for all catalysts. For the smaller sized catalysts (Pd-Ti/C-k) the Mears criterion approached 0.15 at the lowest flow rates (longest LHSV) and were lower than 0.15 at higher flow rates (Table S1). These results suggest that the catalytic systems were not externally mass transfer limited over the LHSV range of 23–92 h−1 (0.01–0.04 h) for Pd-Ti/C-k and all runs for Pd-Ti/C-d. We acknowledge that one run in the Pd-Ti/C-k may have been externally mass transfer limited. The Wiesz-Prater values (CWP) ranged from 0.02 to 0.2 for all catalysts (Table S2). For reaction orders of 1 and 2, CWP values ≤ 0.6 and 0.3, respectively indicate absence of pore diffusion limitation [53]. Our analysis indicates that catalytic furfural hydrogenations were not internally mass transfer limited."
11,Rate law development,"3.3 Rate law development A reaction pathway based on our results for furfural (FUR) hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol (FA), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), 2-methylfuran (2-MF), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF), 5-hydroxy-2-pentanone (5H2P), 4-hydroxy-2-pentanone (4-HCP), 2-cyclopentenone (2-CP), and cyclopentanone (CP) formation is shown in Fig. 4 . Assuming metal–acid functionality, a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism was applied with the assumptions of dissociative adsorption of hydrogen at the metal active site, rate-limiting role of surface reactions, and the presence of two different active sites (S1 for the metal, S2 for the acid site). Since radsorption= −rdesorption and Kadsorption = 1/Kdesorption , all the adsorption and desorption steps were combined into one category (see equations in SI). We next assumed irreversible surface hydrogenation reactions [10] where S1 is Pd and S2 is a Pd-Ti (acid site) as noted below. R e a c t i o n 1 : F U R . S 1 + 2 H . S 1 → k 1 F A .

S 1 + 2 S 1 Small to zero yields of 2-MTHF, CP, 2-CP, 4-HCP and 1,4PD were observed with the catalysts [15,41]. It has been suggested that addition of weak acid or Lewis acid sites next to the metal sites promoted FA ring opening and subsequent hydrogenation to 5H2P [15], over the desorption of FA and Piancatelli rearrangement to 4-hydroxy-2-pentenone (4HCP) in the aqueous phase with subsequent binding to metal sites and deoxygenation and hydrogenation to cyclopentanone [9]. Therefore, reactions (4), 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 13 were eliminated and simplified to a key set of reactions (Supporting Information). We assumed reaction (6) (exchange of FA from S1 [metal] to S2 [acid]), and 8 and 12 were fast and not rate limiting. Thus, we assumed the only reactions participating in the model were reactions (1), 2, 3 and 11 Performing a site balance for fractional coverages gives, (6) S1: θ1 free + θ 1 H + θ 1 FUR + θ 1 FA + θ 1 THFA + θ 1 2-MF = 1 (7) S2: θ 2 free + θ 2 FA + θ 2 5-H2P = 1 If the rate-limiting steps are surface reactions and adsorption/desorption steps occur rapidly, the quasi equilibria for rapid steps is applied as follows: (8) For adsorption reactions: rAdi = kAdi Ci θfree − krevAdiθi (9) For desorption reactions:rDesi = kDesi θi − krevDesiC i θfree Where k Ad i k revAd i k revDes i k Des i = K i and i is the participating compounds (except H2) in the reaction system.

Therefore, θ 1 H was assumed to be a constant value throughout the reaction.

Nonlinear least square regression of n experimental data points (yi) with curve function of f (x, θ) was applied such that a θ vector is found to obtain the best curve fit of data in least square sense: Q = ∑ 1 n ( y i - f x i , θ ) 2 Where the minimum of Q with respect to θ is, ∂ Q ∂ θ = 2 ∑ 1 n ∂ ( y i - f x i , θ ) ∂ θ = 0 A goodness of fit was calculated as the residual sum of squares (RSS) and R2, RSS = ∑ 1 n ( y i - f x i ) 2 R 2 = 1 - ∑ 1 n ( y i - f x i - ) 2 ∑ 1 n ( y i - y - ) 2"
12,Model analysis,"3.4 Model analysis The kinetic model was fit to two sets of experimental runs (Pd-Ti/C-k and Pd-Ti/C-d) to help validate the trends and repeatability of the catalyst synthesis technique. A different batch of Pd-Ti/C-k catalyst were used for each run (pre-reduced with H2 as noted in the methods) whereas the same batch of Pd-Ti/C-d catalysts were used for all runs (4 runs). The rapid furfural hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol with subsequent, primarily 5H2P and 2MF formation was captured by the model. This is noted in Fig. 5 for the fitting of the experimental concentrations as a function of space time. In general, an acceptable agreement was observed between the experimental data and the kinetic model with R2 and RSS of 0.93–0.96 and 0.009–0.016, respectively. Overall, the concentration residuals between the experimental data and model was ≤ 5% (the exceptions were 2MF for Pd-Ti/k and 5H2P at 0.67 h, Fig. S3). Table 1 shows the 11 kinetic parameters obtained from the kinetic model. These predicted adsorption coefficients (K) and rate constants (k) agree with previous works on liquid phase furfural hydrogenation [36,37,39]. To the best of our knowledge we could not find kinetic data for aqueous phase hydrogenation of furfural, thus our results were compared with hydrogenations in ethanol or 2-propanol (Table 1). An LH model for furfural hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol (FA) using Ir/TiO2 gave a rate constant lower than ours, but a larger equilibrium furfural adsorption coefficient (KFUR). This may have been due to the lower temperature (110 °C vs. 180 °C), different solvent, and different support (Table 1). Similarly, a Cu/Co/Al2O3 indicated a larger KFUR, but a similar rate constant at 200 °C (Table 1). When comparing the hydrogenation of FA to THFA using Ru/TiO2 very similar equilibrium adsorption constants for FA and THFA were reported with a higher THFA rate constant (Table 1). The larger values of k 1 "" and k 11 "" compared to k 2 "" , k 3 "" (in our work, Table 1), indicates that the rate of furfural conversion to FA and 5H2P is higher than the rate of 2MF and THFA formation, supporting the theory of quick conversion of FUR to FA and increase in 5H2P selectivity with addition of Ti. Among the adsorption constants, THFA showed the lowest values indicating the adsorption of reactants (FUR, FA and hydrogen) was preferential. Comparing KFA1 (adsorption at Pd site) and KFA2 (adsorption at Ti or acid site), a stronger adsorption of FA at the metal site was observed."
13,Conclusions,"Kinetics of the multi-step reaction system of aqueous furfural hydrogenation over Pd-TiO2/C catalyst was determined using a two-site, Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. A kinetic model in which H2 dissociatively adsorbs on a metal site, furfuryl alcohol is activated on an acid site (provided by Ti addition), and all surface hydrogenation steps occur in combination with the metal sites, was consistent with the experimental data. The model captured the formation of FA as an intermediate and subsequent conversion to 5H2P and 2MF over more reduced (THFA) and Piancatelli rearrangement products (cyclopentanone). A total of eleven reaction parameters including reaction rate constants and adsorption/desorption constants were obtained from the model and were consistent with the limited values reported in the literature for liquid phase furfural hydrogenation. The rate constant for furfural consumption was found to be significantly higher than for formation of 2MF and THFA. External and internal mass transfer criterion indicate intrinsic rate parameters were estimated and suggest the model can be used to perform monolithic reactor design for aqueous phase hydrogenation of furfural. This suggests the kinetic model can be coupled with heat and mass transfer models to predict the amount of catalyst required for a specified product concentration in aqueous furfural hydrogenation reaction over Pd-TiO2/ACM (with the same loading of Pd and Ti under similar reaction conditions). We acknowledge that it would be valuable to form the Pd-TiO2/C in monolith form for further testing, incorporate the effect of temperature and H2 pressure into the rate law, longevity testing needs to be performed, the effect of water concentration needs to be assessed, and more intimate contact between Pd and Ti (less isolated areas of only Ti and Pd) may improve the selectivity to 5H2P."
