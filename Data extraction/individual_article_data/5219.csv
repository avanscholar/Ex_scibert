0,Introduction,"Diesel fuel is a mixture of multiple hydrocarbon combinations. The content and distribution of n-alkanes exists in diesel fuel are closely associated with the cold flow properties. At low temperatures, the high freezing point n-alkanes are easily separated from diesel and formed wax crystals under the action of van der Waals forces [1]. Paraffin crystals increase as the temperature goes down, then form in a three-dimensional network structure and bring about the cold flow problems, ultimately causing the blockage of pipeline and filters [2,3]. It has brought much inconvenience to the agricultural production, transportation and people's daily life [4–6]. Therefore, the poor cold flow properties of diesel fuel are a technical problem to be solved urgently. Many methods are used to improve the cold flow properties of diesel fuel, such as winterization processing [7], blending process [8] and using chemical additives [2,9–11]. Pour point depressants (PPDs), also called flow improvers or crystal improvers, can affect the growth of wax crystals, thereby enhancing the cold flow properties of diesel fuel [12–14]. It has been proven to be an economical and effective method [12,15]. PPDs usually are polymers, consisting of long chains that interact with paraffin and polar groups capable of changing the structure of paraffin. In order to guarantee the cold flow properties of diesel fuel, various types of polymers have been researched, including ethylene–vinyl acetate copolymer [14], ethylene-butene copolymers [16], α-olefin copolymer [17], poly (alkyl methacrylates) [18], maleic anhydride copolymers and their derivatives [2]. Among them, the modified maleic anhydride polymers have attracted much attention due to their unique properties in recent years. Feng et al. synthesized four different alkyl chain length of alkyl acrylate-vinyl acetate-maleic anhydride terpolymers as cold flow improvers for diesel fuel [2]. At an additive concentration of 2000 ppm, the terpolymers had favorable effect on decreasing SP and viscosity, but it had nerarly no effect on CFPP. Xu et al. introduced various imino pendants to poly (methacrylate-co-maleic anhydride) copolymers as PPDs for diesel fuel [19]. When the most effective PPD was added at 1000 ppm, the CFPP and SP were reduced by 4 and 17 °C, respectively. Lü et al. prepared a series of poly (vinyl acetate-co-maleic anhydride) copolymers modified by different lengths of alkyl alcohol, and ued them as PPDs of diesel fuel [6]. When the normal alkane content in diesel fuel was 1.5 g, the PPD with a 500 ppm concentration brought the best effectiveness of the decrease of CFPP at 8 °C. Thus, an excellent PPD of maleic anhydride should have sufficient side chains, the side chains should be of sufficient length and suitable polar groups. Many experimental and theoretical derivations have been practiced deriving the depressing mechanism of PPDs, and several hypothetical theoretical views have been formed. Nucleation theory believe that PPDs can precipitate out of wax crystals at low temperatures and become the core of wax crystal growth [6]. Co-crystallization theory is that non-polar part of PPDs crystallizes with paraffin, while the polar part prevents further growth of the crystal [20]. Adsorption theory believe that the wax crystals are first precipitated in the diesel fuel, and then the PPDs are adsorbed on the wax crystal surface to prevent further crystal growth [21]. Solubilization theory hold that can improve the solubility of paraffin in diesel fuel, thus affecting the precipitation of wax crystals [22,23]. These theories attempt to explain the mechanism of action of PPDs from their respective perspectives, but they are still being debated by researchers. To completely understand the mechanisms, further studies are necessary. In the present study, a series of long-chain fatty amine and long-chain fatty alcohol modified maleic anhydride-methyl benzyl acrylate copolymer were synthesized, and their depression effects on the cold flow properties of 0# diesel fuel were comparative studied. Besides, the possible action mechanism was explored and proposed through rheological curves, differential scanning calorimetery (DSC) and polarizing optical microscopy (POM)."

All these substances were used analytical grade reagents."
3,Compositions of diesel fuel,"2.2 Compositions of diesel fuel Sample of 0# diesel fuel untreated with any other additives was provided by Sinopec Group, Shanghai, China. The general physicochemical characteristics of diesel fuel is shown in Table 1 . According to our previous reports [19,24], the carbon numbers distribution of n-alkanes in the 0# diesel fuel was analyzed using the Agilent GC-MC 8890. The specific instruments and procedures are shown in Supporting Information. It is established that the distribution of n-alkanes in diesel fuel has an important influence on the formation of wax crystals [6]. The concentration distribution of n-alkane is given in Fig. 1 . The n-alkanes have a carbon number distribution between 9 and 24, mainly distributed between 11 and 21. The average carbon number of normal paraffins is 15.9. The content of n-14 is the most, followed by the content of n-C16. The content of n-C18 is also relatively high."
4,Synthesis of benzyl methacrylate,"2.3 Synthesis of benzyl methacrylate The methyl benzyl acrylate (MB) was synthesized by the reaction of methacrylic acid and benzyl alcohol in a molar ratio 1.2:1, using toluene as solvent, hydroquinone as inhibitor, PTSA as catalyst, water was separated azeotropically using Dean-stark apparatus. The end product benzyl methacrylate obtained was a clear, colourless to pale yellow solution. The synthetic route of methyl benzyl acrylate is showed in Fig. 2 ."
5,Synthesis of copolymers,"2.4 Synthesis of copolymers The above synthesized MB and MA dissolved in toluene in a 1:1 mol ratio were taken in a three-necked flask. At the beginning, the contents were subjected to nitrogen flushing for half an hour. Then gradually heated the reaction mixture to 90 °C. When the system temperature reached the design temperature, BPO dissolved in toluene as an initiator was added drop by drop [31]. The whole content was vigorously stirred for 8 h under the nitrogen atmosphere. Finally, when the reaction system was cooled to the room temperature, excess ethanol was added to the reaction solution. White precipitate was obtained after filtration and follwed by vacuum dried for 12 h. Then 1-tetradecylamine, 1-hexadecylamine and 1-octadecylamine with 1:1 M ratio to MA were separately fed into the above copolymer under reflux for 10 h in toluene [12]. The prepared PPDs were named as N14MA-MB, N16MA-MB and N18MA-MB. 1-tetradecanol, 1-hexadecanol and 1-octadecanol with 2:1 M ratio to MA were separately fed into the above copolymer under reflux for 20 h in xylene [2]. The prepared PPDs were named as C14MA-MB, C16MA-MB and C18MA-MB. The synthetic routines of copolymers are showed in Fig. 3 ."
6,Characterization of copolymers,"2.5 Characterization of copolymers The structures, molecular weight and contact angle of these copolymers were characterized by using iN10 Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometer (Nicolet, USA), Varian Mercury VX-300 NMR spectrometer (USA) 1H NMR, gel permeation chromatograph (Shimadzu Japan), and JC2000D contact angle analyser (Powereach, China). The contact angle of these copolymers was characterized by using the JC2000D contact angle analyser (Powereach, China). The synthesized copolymers were placed on a glass slide to form a film, and the static contact angle was measured with water and dodecane test solution, respectively, at room temperature."
7,Evaluation tests of cold flow performance,"2.6 Evaluation tests of cold flow performance The standard for automotive diesel fuel (GB 19147–2016) in China has clearly specified the CFPP and SP as the crucial indicators for evaluating the cold flow performance of diesel fuel [32]. CFPP is the maximum temperature at which the filter is blocked to the highest temperature when it cannot pass, or the flow rate is less than 20 ml/min [19]. SP is the maximum temperature at which diesel fuel loses its fluidity at low temperatures [24]. The CFPP and SP of treated and untreated diesel fuel were tested by ASTM D6371 and GB/T510, using the SYD-510F1 multifunctional low-temperature tester (Shanghai Changji Instrument Co., Ltd., China). Parallel test was used to ensure testing results repeated and reliable, and only the average was given."
8,POM measurement,2.7 POM measurement The POM analysis is an intuitive and effective method for observing and studying the wax morphology of waxes and the crystallization behavior of wax crystals. A polarizing optical microscopy (Leica Germany DM2500 P) was used to assess the paraffin crystal morphology of treated and untreated diesel fuel at the cooling speed of 0.5 °C/min from 20 to −40 °C.
9,DSC measurement,2.8 DSC measurement The process of wax crystal precipitation in diesel fuel is actually the process of diesel fuel changing from liquid-liquid phase to liquid–solid phase. The crystallization behavior of diesel fuel was investigated by DSC method. DSC measurements were implemented by using a thermal analyzer (TA Instruments Q2000) at the cooling speed of 5 °C/min from 20 to −40 °C.
10,Rheological measurement,"2.9 Rheological measurement Viscosity is of significant parameter for evaluating the flow performance of diesel fuel. Lower viscosity usually means better cold flow performance. The rheology properties of treated and untreated diesel oil were characterized by an advanced rheometer rheometer (Germany HAAKE MARS III). Before doing any rheological measurement, the sample of diesel fuel was treated at 20 °C for 40 min to eliminate the original shear and heat history of diesel fuel and ensure that the additive was completely dissolved. At a constant shear rate of 5 s−1, the dynamic viscosity was measured over a temperature range of 20 to −40 °C with a cooling rate of 1 °C/ min."
11,Results and discussion,
12,Characterization of copolymers,"3.1 Characterization of copolymers 3.1.1 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy The compositions of the prepared PPDs was characterized by FTIR spectroscopy and the FTIR-spectra are shown in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4(a) show that FTIR-spectrum of MA-MB, skeleton stretching vibration peak of benzene at 1498 and 1454 cm−1, monosubstituted peak of benzene at 750 and 697 cm−1. The characteristic C = O strong absorption peak of ester group at 1720 cm−1, and the COC stretching peak is detected at 1241 and 1150 cm−1. The characteristic CH3 and CH2 absorption peaks of the alkyl group adsorption peaks at 2924 and 2853 cm−1. The characteristic C = O stretching peak of polymeric maleic anhydride at 1853 and 1783 cm−1. By contrasting Fig. 4(b) with Fig. 4(a), the absorption peak of long chain ( (CH2)n and n > 4) appeared in 721 cm−1, and the stretching vibration peak of amide C-N appeared at 1853 cm−1. In addition, spectra of Fig. 4(c) indicates that esterification reaction has taken place, that the long chain ( (CH2)n and n > 4) absorption peak is detected at 723 cm−1. This indicates that copolymers were synthesized and modified successfully. 3.1.2 1H NMR spectra The chemical structure of the copolymer without organic modification is characterized by 1H NMR analysis. All the peaks of hydrogen in the sample are marked. As shown in Fig. 5 (a), the characteristic peaks at 7.294–7.426 ppm could be attributed to the chemical displacement of hydrogen from benzene ring in benzyl group, and 3.732 ppm, 1.354 ppm and 1.236 ppm are the chemical displacement of hydrogen in methylene near the benzene group, methylene in the main chain, and methyl, respectively. The characteristic peak of maleic anhydride in the copolymer is at 2.792 ppm. The integrations of the proton in the benzene group of copolymers are fixed to 1. The proton peak integral of the maleic anhydride group is 0.37. The ratio of benzyl methacrylate/maleic anhydride calculated by the 1H NMR peak integration is close to the feed ratio (1:1), which demonstrates an alternating sequence structure [33,34]. Fig. 5(b) and Fig. 5(c) show the typical 1H NMR spectra of the modified copolymers N14MA-MB and C14MA-MB. Compared with Fig. 5(a), the peak area of long-chain methylene bands in Fig. 5(b) is larger. Meanwhile, 3.499 ppm is the chemical displacement of hydrogen in CH2 near the maleic anhydride group. Therefore, the synthesis of modified copolymer is successful. Organic modification ratio (f) is defined as the side chain group number which react with each maleic anhydride unit. The ratio of the graft ratio of aliphatic amine to aromatic alcohol is calculated by the 1H NMR peak integration. The graft ratios of these copolymers are shown in Table 2 [18]. 3.1.3 Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) The conventional GPC method was applied for molecular weight determination and polydispersity index of the prepared copolymers. In this test, tetrahydrofuran at a flow rate of 1 ml/min was used as the mobile phase, and polystyrene of different molecular weight was used as a standard. The consequences were shown in Table 3 . It is generally believed that the molecular weight of the additive is between 4,000 to 100,000 g/mol, the improvement of the cold flow performance of diesel fuel is more significant. The resulting data revealed that the molecular weight (Mw) and number average (Mn) molecular weight of the synthesized polymers is between 7.67 × 104 to 8.23 × 104g/mol and 5.79 × 104 to 7.01 × 104g/mol, respectively. In addition, the polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) ranges from 1.195 to 1.328. All data fall between the suggested upper and lower bounds. By comparing and analyzing the polydispersity index of most cold flow improvers synthesized in analogous studies, it can be known that although there are some differences in the polydispersity index of the six modified copolymers, it is reasonable for this study. Therefore, it is feasible to use the synthesized modified copolymers as potential PPDs. 3.1.4 Static contact angle The oil affinity and oil solubility of the PPDs in diesel were studied by the static contact angle [35,36]. In general, the material is hydrophobic when the contact angle in water is >90°, and oil-wet when the contact angle in dodecane is less than 90°. Fig. 6 shows the static contact angle as water and dodecane are dropped onto the slide, respectively. As it can be seen from Fig. 6, the static contact angle of droplets is in the range of 112-132° and all over 110°. This phenomenon indicates that the synthetic copolymers are hydrophobic. Meanwhile, dodecane droplet completely penetrated into the copolymers, the contact angle is basically 0°. The experimental results show that the synthesized copolymers are super lipophilic. Thus, the synthetic copolymers have super-oil properties and can be well dispersed in diesel fuel, and it has signs of becoming an effective PPDs of diesel fuels."
13,Effect on the CFPP and SP,"3.2 Effect on the CFPP and SP The SP and CFPP of untreated diesel fuel are −7°C and −2°C, respectively (Table 1). The effects of a series of aminated copolymers R1MB-MA (R1 = N14, N16, N18) and esterified copolymers R2MB-MA (R2 = C14, C16, C18) on the CFPP and SP of diesel fuel are shown in Fig. 7 . As shown in Fig. 7, all these PPDs can reduce SP and CFPP in various degrees, and ΔCFPP and ΔSP refers to the reduction effects of these PPDs on CFPP and SP of diesel fuel, respectively. After treated with the aminated copolymers R1MA-MB (R1 = N14, N16, N18), the ΔCFPP and ΔSP of diesel are primarily in the range of 0–3 °C and 6–17 °C, respectively, while N14MA-MB exhibits a better reduction on the CFPP and SP than N16MA-MB and N18MA-MB. Especially, ΔCFPP and ΔSP of diesel fuel treated with 500 ppm N18MA-MB reach a maximum (3 °C and 17 °C). However, the depression effect of esterified copolymers R2MA-MB (R2 = C14, C16, C18) on the cold flow properties of diesel is obviously higher than aminated copolymers R1MA-MB (R1 = N14, N16, N18). The reason may be that more side chains in esterified copolymers provide more crystallization sites, change the shape, size, quantity and aggregation of the wax crystals in diesel fuel, ultimately exhibits a more considerable depression on the CFPP and SP than that of aminated copolymers. The ΔCFPP and ΔSP increase with the dosage of the esterified copolymers, and then decreases or tends towards stable. All these PPDs play the optimum depression effect at 500 ppm dosage. Although appropriate dosage of esterified copolymers in diesel can provide more quantity of crystallization sites, retard the formation of large crystals, and reduce the CFPP and SP. Excessive esterified copolymers in diesel may generate large number of crystals and interact with the formed crystals, thereby blocking the filters and pipeline and deteriorating the cold flow properties of diesel. However, C14MB-MA is the one that works best for improving the cold flow properties of diesel. As the dosage of C14MB-MA up to 500 ppm, the diesel exerts the most considerable cold flow properties, and the CFPP and SP of diesel fuel are reduced by 8 °C and 24 °C, respectively."
14,DSC analysis,"3.3 DSC analysis According to our previous work, DSC has been proven an effective characterization method to analyze the energy change of diesel with and without PPDs at low temperatures [19,24]. The DSC curves and data analysis of untreated diesel fuel and diesel treated with 500 ppm N14MA-MB, 250 ppm C14MA-MB, 500 ppm C14MA-MB and 1000 ppm C14MA-MB are displayed in Fig. 8 and Table 4 , respectively. In the DSC curves, Tonset refers to the starting temperature of the peak that represents the starting precipitation temperature of wax crystals, while the slope of the peak represents the deposition rate of wax crystals in diesel fuel. ΔH refers to the solid–liquid phase change energy that represents the dispersion stability of the system [19,37]. As shown in Fig. 8 and Table 4, the Tonset of untreated diesel fuel is −3.93 °C, which is nearly equal to that of diesel treated with N14MA-MB and C14MA-MB in the range from −3.97 °C to −3.76 °C. It demonstrates that the synthetic PPDs cannot change the starting temperature of the precipitation of wax crystals in diesel fuel. Moreover, the ΔH of treated diesel fuel is significantly lower than that of untreated diesel fuel, which indicates diesel fuel exhibit a better dispersion stability after PPD treated. C14MA-MB treated diesel has lower ΔH than that of N14MA-MB, and the ΔH of 500 ppm C14MA-MB treated diesel fuel is the lowest (85.75 J/g), so that it processes the best dispersion stability. However, the peak and onset temperatures of untreated and treated diesel fuel is in parallel trends, and the addition of PPD has no effect on the slope and integral area of the DSC curves, thus the precipitation rate and amount of wax crystal in diesel fuel are not been influenced by the PPDs."
15,Rheological measurements,"3.4 Rheological measurements The lower the viscosity at the same temperature, the better the fluidity of diesel fuel at low temperature [38,39]. The kinematic viscosity of diesel fuel of untreated and treated with N14MA-MB and C14MA-MB at different temperature was showed in Fig. 9 . As it can be seen from Fig. 9, all the samples changed from Newtonian fluid to non-Newtonian fluid, and the viscosity increased following the temperature down. Only in the non-Newtonian fluid range can the PPDs play a role in reducing viscosity. Fig. 9 shows that the inflection point of the temperature-viscosity curve of treated diesel appeared earlier than the untreated diesel. The diesel fuel with PPDs has a tendency to enter the state of non-Newtonian fluid in advance. As the temperature continues to drop, the viscosity of pure diesel increases dramatically. In comparison, the viscosity increase rate of diesel sample with PPDs was obviously reduced. The effect of C14MA-MB on lowering the viscosity of diesel was better than that of N14MA-MB, while 500 ppm C14MA-MB treated diesel fuel presents the relatively lowest viscosity. These results are consistent with their depression effect on the SP and CFPP that displayed in Fig. 7. It may be explained as that the maleic anhydride group and the benzyl group are good groups for changing the growth mode of the wax crystal, meanwhile, the grafted long-chain alkyl group can be effectively adsorbed on the wax crystals in diesel fuel, further changing the growth mode of the wax crystal, thus decreasing the viscosity and improving the cold flow properties of diesel fuel. Also, the depression effects of C14MA-MB are closely related to their dosages in diesel. With increasing addition of C14MA-MB, the overall trends of ΔSP and ΔCFPP were gradually increased and then tend to stabilize or decrease. Similarly, the viscosity first decreased and then increased with the increasing C14MA-MB at low temperature. Excessive C14MA-MB (1000 ppm) in diesel may generate large number of crystallization sites and reduce the CFPP and SP that equivalent to that of C14MA-MB (500 ppm) to some extent. However, larger number of crystallization sites grows and distribute in the system. These crystals will interact with each other, increase the tendency of wax crystal agglomeration, ultimately form into relative larger crystals, thereby deteriorating the viscosity of diesel."
16,POM analysis,"3.5 POM analysis The microscopic images of diesel fuel, and diesel fuel adding N14MA-MB (500 ppm), C14MA-MB (250, 500 and 1000 ppm) at −10 °C are shown in Fig. 10 . In the microscopic image, the wax crystals show a bright image due to the reflection of polarized light, while the amorphous substance appear black due to the absorption of polarized light. As show in Fig. 10, many large and irregularly shaped wax crystals in untreated diesel are cross-linked together to form in a three-dimensional network structure, which encloses the residual liquid with good cold fluidity, thus resulting in the diesel fuel losing its fluidity at low temperature (Fig. 10a). The number, size, and shape of wax crystals are obvious changed after the diesel fuel treated with the PPDs of N14MA-MB and C14MA-MB. In the presence of N14MA-MB in diesel, the wax crystals are translated into the elliptical shape. Also, the sizes of wax crystals are significantly reduced, but the amount are substantial increased (Fig. 10b). Similarly, the wax crystals are changed into a regular feather shape and dispersed more uniformly in the presence of C14MA-MB in diesel. the elliptical shape. Also, the sizes of wax crystals significantly reduced, but the amount are substantial increased in different extent. The crystal form and morphology are also influence by the dosage of PPDs. As the addition of C14MA-MB increased from 250 ppm from 500 ppm, the sizes and amount of wax crystals are obviously decreased (Fig. 10d). The PPD of C14MA-MB in diesel fuel changed the crystal behaviors by modifying the crystal growth direction, restraining the crystal accumulation, and retarding the formation of large crystals, therefore, the little sizes of regular wax crystals can easily pass through the filters and oil-conveying pipe of diesel engine, and finally enhancing the cold flow properties of diesel fuel. Additionally, the results of POM are in agreement with that in Fig. 7 ~ 9 that means the synthesized PPDs were credible and feasible."
17,Conclusions,"(1) The aminated and esterified maleic anhydride-methyl benzyl acrylate copolymers (MA-MB) were successfully synthesized, purified, characterized, and as effective PPDs in diesel fuel. The esterified MA-MB exhibited better depression effects on improving the cold flow properties of diesel than aminated MA-MB. (2) The esterified copolymer of C14MA-MB was considered as the optimal PPD of them. It exhibited the most considerable reduction on the SP and CFPP by 24 and 8 °C at a dosage of 500 ppm, respectively. (3) POM and DSC analysis showed that C14MA-MB changed the crystal behaviors by modifying the crystal growth direction, restraining the crystal accumulation, and retarding the formation of large crystals. Rheological measurements also showed that C14MA-MB presented the lower viscosity at an identical low-temperature. Thus, the C14MA-MB treated diesel fuel exerted excellent cold flowability."
