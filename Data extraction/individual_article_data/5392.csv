0,Introduction,"As a potential alternative fuel or additive, the higher alcohols (C1–C5 mixed alcohols) have many advantages including complete combustion, high octane numbers and volatility control [1,2]. In view of both resources utilization and environmental protection, the higher alcohol synthesis (HAS) from coal or natural gas via syngas has attracted much attention in recent years [3,4]. Due to the excellent sulfur tolerance and high activity for water–gas shift reaction, alkali-doped molybdenum sulfide (ADM) catalysts are more attractive for commercial aspects among various HAS catalysts [5–7]. The 3d transition metals, in particular F-T elements such as Ni and Co, were found to be effective promoters to enhance the alcohol yield as well as C2+OH selectivity of Mo catalysts [7–11]. Generally, it was considered that at least two forms of transition metal promoters simultaneously existed in MoS2-based catalysts, namely, separated phases of transition metal sulfides and mixed phases such as so-called “CoMoS” and “NiMoS” [12,13]. For Mo-based HAS catalysts, it has been recognized that the close interaction between Mo and promoter atoms exerted great influence on promotion effects and much efforts including unique preparation methods, modifications by promoters and supporters were attempted to obtain highly dispersed catalysts [14–16]. Moreover, the structural effects of active additives (such as Ni, Pd) played an important role for CO hydrogenation, namely, small crystallites had advantages to produce alcohols while larger crystallites to hydrocarbons [17,18]. For ADM catalysts modified by Ni, the promotion effects were closely related to the structure and morphology of nickel, and the highly-dispersed Ni species would lead to high performance of HAS [19–21]. As a potential element, enhancement effects of La modification on Mo-based catalysts were expected to improve both dispersion of the active metals and sulfidation of active components by minimizing the Mo–O–La interactions of active species and suppressing the agglomeration of the MoS2 layers [22]. Thus, in the present work, effects of lanthanum on Ni/ADM catalyst for higher alcohols synthesis were investigated."
1,Experimental,"K2CO3/MoS2 (ADM, K/Mo molar ratio=0.7) and Ni/K2CO3/MoS2 (Ni/ADM, Ni/K/Mo molar ratio=0.5/0.7/1.0) catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation and thermal decomposition method, respectively, as described elsewhere [19]. La/Ni/K2CO3/MoS2 (La/Ni/ADM) catalyst with a La/Ni molar ratio=1/10 was prepared as follows: the solutions of Ni(CH3COO)2 ·4H2O, La(NO3)3 and (NH4)2MoS4 were added to a solution of 30% acetic acid at 60 °C. After stirring and reacting thoroughly, the resulting mixture was cooled to room temperature and aged overnight. After filtration, the precipitate was dried and mixed with K2CO3 followed by thermal decomposition at 500 °C for 1 h under N2. BET areas of the catalysts were measured with ASAP-2000 Micromeritics instrument and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/Max 2500 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation as the X-ray source (40 kV, 100 mA). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the catalysts were obtained using a LEO 438VP SEM. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) was recorded on a ESCALAB-210 spectrometer (VG Scientific Company, UK) using an AlKa X-ray source and the base pressure of the chamber was less than 2×10−9 Pa. The catalytic tests were carried out in a stainless fixed-bed reactor with i.d. of 5 mm with a catalyst loading was 2 ml. Premixed CO and H2 were introduced to the reactor after purification and preheating. The products were analyzed by gas chromatographs: H2, CO, CH4, CO2 were separated by a TDX01 column and were monitored by TCD, the liquid products were separated by a Porapake-Q column and were monitored by FID. The activity of catalyst was expressed as space-time-yield (STY), gROH/mlcat/h and the alcohol selectivity was based on carbon mole selectivity on a CO2 free basis. The data were taken at steady state after 100 h on-stream."
2,Results and discussion,"The XRD patterns indicated the poorly crystalline hexagonal MoS2 with 2θ values of 14.4, 33.2, 39.3 and 58.3, respectively, in all cases and two types of K-contained phases, namely, rhombohedral K–Mo–S (21.1, 27.1 and 38.8) and K2CO3 were observed for ADM sample (see Fig. 1 ). Generally, K2CO3 would transform into K–Mo–S phase, which was related to active sites for alcohol synthesis [11,19]. However, the presence of K2CO3 suggested that there was excess K2CO3 existed on the surface of MoS2. The addition of Ni caused new diffraction peaks at 31.4, 35.3, 37.0 and 53.4, which were related to the second phase of NiS x such as rhombohedral Ni3S2 [21,23]. In MoS2-based catalyst system, the addition of the transition metal sulfides might result in various crystalline or amorphous mixed phases and separated bulk phases such as Ni3S2, Co9S8 were always observed at high loading [23]. In the case of La/Ni/ADM, the diffraction peak intensities of Ni3S2 became weaker apparently, suggesting that the addition of La inhibited the formation of larger crystal particles of Ni3S2. No diffraction peak related to the La-contained phases was observed due to the low La content. Moreover, a similar function was found on the bulk of MoS2, which might be caused by a strong interaction between Mo and La. SEM micrographs of the samples were illustrated in Fig. 2 . For ADM sample, small clusters decorated on the surface of MoS2 were related to K2CO3 and K–Mo–S particles. For Ni/ADM sample, an amount of congregated particles appeared on the surface of MoS2. According to the XRD results, these larger particles might be NiS x such as Ni3S2. The morphological differences between the Ni/ADM and La/Ni/ADM catalysts were evident. With the disappearance of larger particles, the surface of La/Ni/MoS2 catalyst was covered by small-conglutinated particles, which existed in irregular shape and showed significant porosity. Apparently, the remarkable changes of morphology and structure caused by La indicated that the addition of La improved the dispersion of Ni. As shown in Table 1 , the addition of Ni caused the decrease in the surface area due to the congregation of promoter [19], however, a higher surface area of La/Ni/ADM was observed as expected. Fig. 3 gave XPS of Mo3d and Ni2p of the samples. In all cases, the binding energy for Mo3d3/2 and Mo3d5/2 were around 232.4 and 229.1 eV, respectively, which could be assigned to MoS2 [24,25]. The addition of Ni caused the shift of Mo3d5/2 binding energy toward lower values due to a strong electron transfer from Ni to Mo [23]. For La/Ni/ADM catalyst, the binding energy of Mo3d5/2 was more negative, indicating that La enhanced the interaction between Ni and Mo, which was further confirmed by the remarkable change of Ni2p between Ni/ADM and La/Ni/ADM samples [22]. Ni was readily congregated to form larger particles on the surface of MoS2 [19], which resulted in a higher surface content of Ni (see Table 1). Thus, the addition of La inhibited the enrichment of Ni clearly on the surface of catalyst, which was in line with the XRD results. For CO hydrogenation, the presence of Ni generated a positive effect on the reactivity, in particular C2+OH selectivity for ADM catalyst (see Table 2 ). Unfortunately, a high selectivity to hydrocarbons (52.57%) was also observed due to the fierce methanation of Ni. Modified by La, the selectivity to hydrocarbons decreased remarkably from 53.57% to 33.95% and the rate of alcohol production increased from 0.14 to 0.17 g/ml/h. Moreover, the addition of La further improved the formation of C2+OH. A slight decrease of CO conversion might be due to the inhibition of hydrocarbons formation. It was well known that on the surface of Ni, CO was readily dissociated to surface carbon species which formed methane by direct hydrogenation [26,27]. Apparently, congregated NiS x particles were closely related to the active sites for the formations of hydrocarbons, while highly-dispersed Ni species favored the production of alcohols. In the present case, although the identification of the precise structure of La species was difficult due to the lower loading, the great influence of La on the structure and morphology of Ni was closely related to active sites for higher alcohols formations. In fact, La loadings would affect the surface concentration of active components such as Ni species, which was under research."
3,Conclusions,"A novel La/Ni/ADM catalyst was investigated which showed high performance for HAS, namely, high activity of C2+OH formation and low selectivity to hydrocarbons. In La/Ni/ADM catalyst, the strong interaction between La and Ni was favor to a close interaction between Ni and the bulk of MoS2. Such an interaction inhibited the congregation of Ni and resulted in more highly-dispersed of Ni species on the surface of catalyst, which were favor to the formations of higher alcohols."
