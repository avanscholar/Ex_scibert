0,Introduction,"The overconsuming fossil fuel has aroused serious energy crisis and environmental pollution [1,2]. Photocatalytic water splitting is one of the most promising technologies for converting renewable solar energy into green, storable and high heat value (120–142 MJ kg−1) hydrogen [3]. Recently, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), as a metal-free polymer semiconductor (2.7 eV) [4,5], has attracted enormous attention due to its good physicochemical stabilities, suitable band gap structure, adjustable electronic structure and controllable morphologies [6–8]. However, the pristine g-C3N4 generally exhibits low photocatalytic efficiency, because of its intrinsic drawbacks including insufficient visible light absorption, rapid electron-hole recombination and low charge mobility [9–13]. Therefore, to settle these challenges, developing a powerful strategy is highly significant yet unresolved. To date, various methods have been adopted to overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks, including defect engineering [14,15], morphology regulating [16,17], and heterojunction construction [18–21]. Among these, metal doping is an effective strategy to modulate the electronic structure of g-C3N4, which can not only produce traps in forbidden band to suppress carriers recombination and enhance the visible light absorption, but also provides effective proton reduction sites [22–26]. Generally, porous nanostructures are extremely advantageous, such as larger specific surface area, shorter charge diffusion distance, and more mass transfer channels [27–29]. Therefore, it is worth trying to construct metal elements doped porous g-C3N4 nanostructures. For example, Zhang and co-workers [30] synthesized single-site dispersed Fe atoms modified porous crimped graphitic carbon nitride polymer by thermal condensation of the precursor, which exhibits high photocatalytic H2 evolution performance (3390 μmol h−1 g−1, 3 wt% Pt as cocatalyst) under visible light. Cao et al. [31] reported a layered g-C3N4 photocatalyst, with atom-dispersed Pd as the bridging sites of adjacent layers and surface-sites, in which the Pd is stabilized by both Pd-N and Pd-C bonds, the average H2 production rate is 6688 μmol h−1 g−1 under simulated solar irradiation. Despite such progress, there are still several critical challenging issues regarding the photocatalytic performance enhancement of g-C3N4. Firstly, it is naturally considered that simultaneous porosity engineering and metal doping could further improve the photocatalytic performance since they can supply more abundant surface active sites and optimized electronic structures. However, it remains a challenge due to the lack of facile one-pot synthesis method. Secondly, most current reports on single-site metal anchored g-C3N4 have focused on the noble metals such as Au, Ag and Pt [32–36], which are quite scarcity and high cost. Therefore, it is highly desired to develop the non-noble metal modified g-C3N4 catalyst. To the best of our knowledge, the preparation and investigation of single-site dispersed W atoms doped g-C3N4 have not been reported yet. More importantly, to achieve high H2 evolution performance, diverse sacrificial agents, including triethanolamine, lactic acid and methanol, are used to consume holes, which would produce undesired by-product and increase the experimental cost [31,37,38]. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop bifunctional photocatalyst with highly efficient solar energy conversion, which can simultaneously realize the performance optimization of photocatalytic H2 evolution and organic molecules selective oxidation to value-added products. In this work, the single W atom dispersed graphitic carbon nitride porous unltrathin nanosheets (WSA-CN-PUNS) were prepared by using the polyprrole-polyoxometalate/g-C3N4 composites as precursor, in combination with a thermal oxidation etching process. First, the experimental results suggest that the as-prepared W atoms modified g-C3N4 catalysts exhibit enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution and high activity in selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to aldehyde under visible light. Among, the WSA-CN-PUNS sample exhibits remarkable H2 evolution rate of 3.02 mmol h−1 g−1, which is about 4.1 and 9.7 times higher than that of the un-doped and pristine g-C3N4, respectively. When using benzyl alcohol as holes trapping agents, the WSA-CN-PUNS sample still displays high activity of 298.7 and 305.1 μmol h−1 g−1 toward H2 and benzaldehyde production, which are about 3 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4. In addition, the DFT calculation is conducted to study the effect of W atoms on the electronic structures of g-C3N4, the results suggest that the W atoms doping decreases the band gap, leads to dopant related defect levels and improves the carrier separation. This work highlights a promising approach to prepare a high-efficiency W single atoms modified porous g-C3N4 bifunctional photocatalysts, which eliminates the waste of sacrificing agent and proves its great potential for practical applications of photocatalytic H2 evolution."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalysts synthesis,"2.1 Catalysts synthesis All chemical reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used directly as received without further purification. Bulk g-C3N4 was pre-synthesized by thermal polycondensation of urea and denoted as pristine CN. Briefly, 15 g of urea was placed in a crucible with a cover, which was then put into a muffle furnace and annealed at 550℃ for 4 h. The porous g-C3N4 nanosheets sample was prepared by thermal oxidation etching of the bulk g-C3N4 at 500℃ for 2 h in air with a ramp rate of 5℃/min and denoted as CN-PUNS. In a typical synthesis of g-C3N4/PW12-PPy, 50 mg of as-synthesized bulk g-C3N4 was dispersed in 70 mL de-ionized water by ultrasound to form a suspension. Then, 4 μmol of phosphotungstic acid (PW12) was added and mixed uniformly after 10 min stirring. Subsequently, 320 μL of pyrrole (Py) monomer solution, which was obtained by dispersing 50 μL of pyrrole in 5 mL de-ionized water, was slowly dropped into the above mixed g-C3N4/PW12 suspension. A blue-brown solution was obtained after about 5 min stirring at room temperature. Finally, the resulting mixture was placed into an oil bath and vigorously magnetic stirring at 50℃ for 30 h. The final products were obtained via centrifugation and washed three times with de-ionized water and anhydrous ethanol. The obtained g-C3N4/PW12-PPy nanohybrids were dried in vacuum at 60℃ and denoted as g-C3N4/PW12-PPy (4). In control experiments, g-C3N4/PW12-PPy (8) was synthesized by identical condition except that the amount of PW12 and Py are 8 μmol and 718 μL, respectively. To prepare the W single atom dispersed and clusters modified graphitic carbon nitride samples, 100 mg of g-C3N4/PW12-PPy composite was annealed at 500℃ for 2 h with the heating rate of 2℃/min in the atmosphere and designated as WSA-CN-PUNS and Wcl-CN-PUNS, respectively."
3,Photocatalytic H2 generation experiments,"2.2 Photocatalytic H2 generation experiments The photocatalytic H2 production experiments were performed in a all-glass automatic online trace gas analysis system (Lasolar-6A, Beijing PerfectLight Co. Ltd, China). 10 mg photocatalyst was dispersed in 20 mL aqueous solution (10 vol% triethanolamine as sacrificial agent) by ultrasound, and 1.0 wt% Pt was used as co-catalyst by photoreduction of H2PtCl6. The suspension solution was added into a 150 mL double layered Pyrex reaction cell linked to a circulating cold bath (25℃). Then, the cell was connected to the online system and removed the air and dissolved oxygen by repeatedly evacuating several times. The visible light (λ > 420 nm) was generated by a 300 W Xe-lamp (PLS-SXE300/300UV, Beijing PerfectLight Co. Ltd, China) with an ultraviolet cut-off filter, which was illuminated from the top with a irradiation area of 15.9 cm2 and 10 cm distance. The amount of the produced H2 was analyzed by an on-line GC-7900 gas chromatography (Techcomp, China) equipped with a TCD detector, TDX-01 Packed column and using Ar as carrier gas. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was measured by merely changing band pass filters with different wavelengths (420, 450, 500 and 550 nm). The AQE was calculated by the following equation: AQE = [ ( 2 × the amount of evolved H 2 molecules ) / the number of incident photons ] × 100 %"
4,Photocatalytic H2 evolution and benzyl alcohol selective oxidation measurements,"2.3 Photocatalytic H2 evolution and benzyl alcohol selective oxidation measurements The simultaneous photocatalytic benzyl alcohol oxidation and H2 generation experiments were almost the same as the process of photocatalytic H2 evolution measurement, except that 21 μL benzyl alcohol was used instead of TEOA. The amount of evolved H2 was quantified by the on-line gas chromatography. The amount of benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectroscopy as follows: The suspension was collected and filtered through a 0.22 μm nylon syringe filter to remove the catalyst, then the solution was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 10 mL) and was characterized using a ThermoQuest Trace GC2000/Trace MS spectrometer equipped with a HP-5 fused silica capillary column (0.25 μm × 0.25 mm × 30 m). The conversion of benzyl alcohol and selectivity efficiency of benzyl alcohol (BA)/benzaldehyde (BAD) were calculated as follows: (1) Conversion % = n initial B A - n residual B A / n initial B A × 100 % (2) Selectivity % = n producted B A D / n initial B A - n residual B A × 100 %"
5,Photo-electrochemical measurements,"2.4 Photo-electrochemical measurements The transient photocurrent responses, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott-Schottky plots measurements were performed on a CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chen Hua Instrument Corporation, China), following the procedures described in our previous work [39]. 4 mg of the catalyst and 40 μL of 5 wt% Nafion were ultrasonically dispersed in 460 μL of isopropanol. Then, the working electrode was prepared by dropping 50 μL of the resulted ink onto the surface of the ITO glass with a coated area of 1 × 1 cm2 and dried at 60℃ for 12 h in an oven. The Mott-Schottky plots were recorded in the potential range of −0.8 to 0.8 V at a frequency of 1000 Hz with an AC voltage amplitude of 10 mV. The conduction band (ECB) position of n-type semiconductor was estimated based on the flat-band potential (Efb) measured by the Mott-Schottky plots [40,41]. Combined with the semiconductor bandgap (Eg) obtained by the UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, the position of the valance band (EVB) can be calculated according to the following equation [41]: (3) E VB = E g + E CB"
6,DFT computational details,"2.5 DFT computational details Density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on first-principles were performed by using the projected augmented wave (PAW) [42] method implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [43,44]. The plane wave basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 550 eV was used to expand the Kohn-Sham one-electron states. The geometrical optimization and the electronic structure calculations were performed by the GGA-PBE [45] exchange–correlation function. The Monkhorst-Pack [46] sampling method was carried out for the Brillouin-zone (BZ) integration with a density of 2 × 2 × 1 for the geometry optimizations, and 4 × 4 × 1 for the electronic structure calculations. To avoid the interaction between neighboring slabs, a vacuum layer of 15 Å was included. When the maximum magnitude of the force acting on the atoms is smaller than 0.03 eV/Å, all atoms are fully relaxed."
7,XAFS measurements,"2.6 XAFS measurements X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements at W L3 -edge were performed at beamline 9-BM-B, Advanced Photon Source (APS), in transmission mode with electron energy of 7 GeV and an average current of 100 mA. The radiation was monochromatized by a Si (111) double-crystal monochromator. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectrum normalization and extended X-Ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) Fourier transform were conducted using Athena package."
8,Materials characterization,"2.7 Materials characterization The X-ray diffractometer (TTR-III, Rigaku Industrial Corporation, Japan) with Cu Kα as the radiation source was used to record the XRD patterns of all samples. The morphology of the as-prepared materials were examined by using a FEI Sirion 200 field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). The further structure investigations were performed on a FEOL-2010F microscope. The high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy elemental analyses were carried out by using a Thermo Fisher Scientific Talox F200X transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. The sample Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were collected on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet 8700 FT-IR spectrometer with KBr discs over the range 4000 to 400 cm−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted by using a Thermo-VG Scientific ESCALab 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra measurements were performed at room temperature by using a JEOL JES-FA200 EPR spectrometer. UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded on a Shimadzu SolidSpec-3700 ultraviolet–visible light spectrophotometer with a white standard of BaSO4 as the reference. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured by using an F-4600 fluorescence spectrometer (Hitachi Ltd., Japan). A time-corrected single photon counting (TCSPC) system (FM4-TCSPC, Horiba Jobin Yvon) was used to obtain the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) curves under the excitation of 350 nm. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained by using a Micromeritics Trista II 3020 M surface area and porosity analyzer. The amount of W was measured by using a Perkin-Elmer ICP Optima 7300 DV inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer."

10,Synthesis and characterization of WSA-CN-PUNS hybrid photocatalysts,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization of WSA-CN-PUNS hybrid photocatalysts The formation process of WSA-CN-PUNS can be described as shown in Scheme 1 . Firstly, the g-C3N4 was synthesized by the thermal polymerization of urea according to the previous reported literature method [47]. Then, the PW12 (H3PW12O40)-PPy/g-C3N4 composite with a uniform distribution was prepared via the oxidation polymerization of Py with the PW12 providing an oxidizing medium [48]. With the polymerization of the Py monomers, PW12 are dispersed into the PPy framework at the molecular scale, which allows the formation of intermediates during the following pyrolysis to protect the in situ generated W single atoms. Finally, the obtained samples were calcined in air at 500℃ for 2 h with a heating rate of 2℃ min−1. The morphology and microstructure of the as-synthesized WSA-CN-PUNS hybrid were investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. Comparison with that of pristine g-C3N4 and g-C3N4/PW12-PPy composites consisting of solid agglomerates (Figs. S1 and S2), the WSA-CN-PUNS is entirely composed of soft and loose ultrathin nanosheets (Fig. S3). Meanwhile, the TEM image (Fig. 1 a) suggests the generation of WSA-CN-PUNS from surface smooth g-C3N4 aggregates transformed into porous nanosheet structure, which is similar to those of CN-PUNS with calcined in air (Fig. S4). The atomic force microscopy (AFM) image and the associated height profile (Fig. 1b, c) demonstrate that the thickness of WSA-CN-PUNS is about 2.3 nm, which is thinner than the pristine g-C3N4 of around 4.4 nm (Fig. S5), implying that the thin sheets can be obtained by oxidation etching in air (Fig. S6). Importantly, no significant clusters or nanoparticles can be observed in the high-magnification TEM images (Fig. 1d). To determine the distribution of W atoms on g-C3N4, the spherical aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) measurement was performed. Compared to the C and N atoms, W atom has much higher electron density, thus the single-site W atoms can be easily recognized because of the highly bright dots. Fig. 1e clearly displays that only isolated bright dots are dispersed on g-C3N4 nanosheets. The size of the bright spot is estimated to be about 2.6 Å, which is about twice the atomic radius of W atom (1.37 Å), demonstrating that W species exist in form of single atoms. The corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis suggests the well distribution of C, N and W elements throughout the g-C3N4 matrix (Fig. 1f). When the loading amount of W is increased, the sample displays similar porous sheets (Fig. S7). It is noted that there are still no large nanoparticles as shown in the high-magnification TEM image (Fig. 1g). However, some clusters (about 8.6 Å) can be found (Fig. 1h) and the dispersion of W atoms becomes dense (Fig. 1i), which is denoted as Wcl-CN-PUNS. The loading content of W for all samples were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), and the obtained results are 0.33 and 1.10 wt% for WSA-CN-PUNS and Wcl-CN-PUNS samples, respectively (Table S1). The X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD, Fig. S8) of all samples exhibit two feature diffraction peaks located at 13.0° and 27.4°, which can be well indexed to the (100) and (002) crystal planes of g-C3N4 (JCPDS#87-1526), corresponding to the in-planar nitride pores structural packing and the characteristic interlayer stacking reflection of conjugated aromatic systems, respectively. There are no observed change of the diffraction peak for the modified samples, implying the basic crystal structure of g-C3N4 is largely reserved. The chemical structure of all samples were also detected by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra (Fig. S9). The band at 810 cm−1 is indexed to the characteristic triazine cycles, the set of strong peaks among 1200–1600 cm−1 belong to the skeletal vibration of the aromatic CN heterocycles, the broad absorption band at 3000–3600 cm−1 is assigned to the primary and secondary amines or the absorbed H2O molecular. The spectra of all samples are extremely similar, which suggests that the air-calcination and W atom doping cannot change the fundamental graphitic structure of g-C3N4. Furthermore, in order to learn the specific surface area and pore structure, the obtained samples were characterized by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) gas adsorption method (Figs. S10 and S11). All the samples exhibit typical type-IV curves and a broad pore size distribution in the range of 10–50 nm, suggesting the mesoporous structure are generated. The BET surface area of WSA-CN-PUNS and Wcl-CN-PUNS are measured to be 92.8 and 95.9 m2 g−1, respectively, which are much higher than those of CN-PUNS (67.5 m2 g−1) and pristine CN (45.6 m2 g−1). Correspondingly, the pore volume of WSA-CN-PUNS (0.43 cm3 g−1) and Wcl-CN-PUNS (0.34 cm3 g−1) are obviously larger than CN-PUNS (0.28 cm3 g−1) and pristine CN (0.17 cm3 g−1). The increased surface area and pore volume are due to the presence of the in-plane pores and the crinkled nanosheets, which usually render them more active sites, higher mass transfer efficiency and are favorable for improving the photocatalytic activity [17]. The compositions and chemical states of all samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS spectra of the obtained pristine CN, CN-PUNS, WSA-CN-PUNS and Wcl-CN-PUNS samples are collected (Figs. S12–S15). The survey spectra indicate that the WSA-CN-PUNS and Wcl-CN-PUNS are mainly composed of C, N, O and W elements, respectively. The corresponding surface element component of the as-prepared WSA-CN-PUNS sample calculated from XPS is listed in the Table S2 of the supplementary material. The C 1s and N 1s spectra of W modified g-C3N4 and CN-PUNS samples show negligible differences from those of pristine g-C3N4, implying the fundamental crystal structure is not altered. The O 1s high-resolution spectra for the WSA-CN-PUNS sample displays three peaks (Fig. 2 a), among which the peak at 532.6 eV can be attributed to the absorbed oxygen species, the peak located at 531.4 eV is assigned to the C-O bond, while the one at 530.1 eV is characteristic peak of W-O coordination [49]. The chemical state of W in the as-prepared catalyst was analyzed by the W 4f high-resolution spectra (Fig. 2b). The binding energy peaks of W 4f5/2 and W 4f7/2 are obtained at 37.7 and 35.5 eV, respectively, typical values for W6+ [50]. In addition, the atomic local structure of the W modified g-C3N4 samples were confirmed by X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurement. Fig. 2c shows the normalized XANES spectra of both samples at W L3 -edge. Both spectra exhibit a broad white-line (WL) feature at around 10210 eV, which primarily corresponds to the W 2p3/2 electron transition to unoccupied W 5d-O 2p hybridized orbitals. The shapes and widths of this WL in both samples are similar to that of reference WO3, indicating the near oxidation states. The decreased WL intensity of Wcl-CN-PUNS sample suggests the increase of W 5d-O 2p orbitals density of states. Moreover, the Fourier transform (FT) extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of both samples are illustrated in Fig. 2d. The peaks at ~1.5 and 2.6 Å are attributed to W-O and W-W scattering path, respectively. The W-O bond peak without W-C bond showing up in both EXAFS spectra suggests the center atom W is surrounded by the oxygen atoms. For the WSA-CN-PUNS sample, weak W-W peak demonstrates the single atom state for the W atoms arrangement. Whereas, the W-W peak intensity increases dramatically in the Wcl-CN-PUNS sample, which is in well agreement with the formation of WO3 sub-nanometer clusters. The local structural parameters of the WSA-CN-PUNS and Wcl-CN-PUNS are listed in Table S3 in the supplementary material. The EXAFS fitting result indicates that the shell coordination number of the central atom W is two, anchored by two O atoms (with the bond length of 1.89 Å). The above X-ray absorption and photoelectron spectroscopy results corroborate the formation of the isolated W atoms anchored on the g-C3N4 matrix for the WSA-CN-PUNS sample."
11,Photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of the resulting materials,"3.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of the resulting materials The photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of all samples were evaluated under visible light (λ > 420 nm) with a relatively low Pt loading content of 1.0 wt% as co-catalyst and triethanolamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial electron donor. Fig. 3 a and b compare the photocatalytic H2 evolution performance of pristine CN, CN-PUNS, WSA-CN-PUNS and Wcl-CN-PUNS samples. The pristine g-C3N4 and air-calcined g-C3N4 samples exhibit relatively low H2 evolution rates of 0.31 and 0.74 mmol h−1 g−1, respectively. Due to the increased porous structure, the CN-PUNS sample has a higher activity than that of pristine CN. While modified with W atoms and air-calcination simultaneously, the WSA-CN-PUNS shows an enhanced H2 generation activity of 3.02 mmol h−1 g−1, nearly 9.7 times that of pristine CN. When the loading amount of W atoms increases to 1.10 wt%, the H2 generation rate of Wcl-CN-PUNS displays limited increase (3.54 mmol h−1 g−1), which may be ascribed to the reduced atomic efficiency since the W atoms become dense and the sub-nanometre clusters are formed. This phenomenon also suggests the critical role of W single atom dispersion for performance enhancement. Compared with the reported literatures (Table S4), our catalyst displays competitive photocatalytic performance. In addition, the quantum efficiency closely follows that of UV–Vis diffuse reflectance absorbance, suggesting that the photocatalytic H2 generation reaction is really driven via light absorption by the photocatalysts (Fig. S16). The AQE of the as-prepared WSA-CN-PUNS sample for H2 at 420 nm is calculated to be 4.11%. Besides, the WSA-CN-PUNS shows nearly linear increase of H2 production during the cycling test (Fig. 3c) and 48 h continuous measurement (Fig. 3d), which suggests the greatly stable photocatalytic performance of the atomically dispersed W engineered g-C3N4 photocatalyst, due to the highly stable interaction between the g-C3N4 matrix and W atoms via W-O and C-O bonds. After the photocatalytic reaction, the WSA-CN-PUNS sample was recycled and then characterized by TEM, XRD and XPS measurements, respectively (Figs. S17–S19). Notably, there is no noticeable change in the morphology and structures, revealing that the catalyst is extremely stable during the water splitting reaction."
12,Photocatalytic H2 production and selective benzyl alcohol oxidation performance,"3.3 Photocatalytic H2 production and selective benzyl alcohol oxidation performance Meanwhile, in order to eliminate the waste of sacrifice agent and demonstrate its great potential in the practical applications of H2 production based on photocatalysis, the as-prepared samples were also used as dual-function photocatalyst for the simultaneous photocatalytic H2 evolution and benzyl alcohol selective oxidation into benzaldehyde under visible light irradiation, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 4 a. Inspiringly, the WSA-CN-PUNS sample displays impressive activity toward H2 and benzaldehyde production with decent rates of 298.7 and 305.1 μmol h−1 g−1, respectively, which are about 3 times higher than that of pristine CN (Fig. 4b, c). Meanwhile, the conversion of benzyl alcohol and selectivity to benzaldehyde are remarkable for WSA-CN-PUNS sample, where a selectivity of ca. 93.6% can be achieved, as listed in Table S5 in the supplementary material, possibly due to the suitable valance band position [51]. Compared with recent literatures (Table S6), our WSA-CN-PUNS hybrid displays competitive photocatalytic activity as bifunctional photocatatlyst for photocatalytic H2 evolution and selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde. These indicate the photocatalytic activity of WSA-CN-PUNS catalyst for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol and H2 evolution can be significantly improved by single W atom doping and constructing porous ultrathin nanosheet."
13,DFT calculations and photo-electrochemical properties,"3.4 DFT calculations and photo-electrochemical properties To better understand the effect of the electronic structure modulation caused by W atoms doping on the photocatalytic performance of the catalyst, the DFT calculations and experimental analysis were performed. First, based on the optimized geometric structure results of the XPS, XAFS analysis and DFT calculations (Figs. S20–S22), we infer that the WN1O2 moiety is the most possible atomic structure for W species in WSA-CN-PUNS. From the calculated band structures (Fig. 5 a, b) and density of states (DOS) results (Fig. S23), it could be concluded that the band gap of the W doped g-C3N4 decreases compared to the pure g-C3N4 upon the functionalization of g-C3N4 with W atoms. The project density of state (PDOS) results indicate that the valence-band maximum (VBM) and conduction-band minimum (CBM) of W doped g-C3N4 hybrid are also dominated by WO, and new dopant related mid-gap states appear (Fig. 5b). Meanwhile, the top and side views for the partial charge density of W doped g-C3N4 in the energy range of −1.47 to −1.2 eV and −0.5 to 0 eV also suggest the partial charge density is composed of W and O (Fig. 5c and Fig. S24). In addition, the charge density distribution for W doped g-C3N4 is calculated (Fig. 5d). The results suggest that charge redistribution mainly occurs at the interface of W doped g-C3N4, and more electrons are accumulated around the neighbor C and N atoms. More localized charge distribution could result in the downshifting of CB and VB of W doped g-C3N4 sample and the formation of dopant related mid-gap states [52]. More importantly, the spatial separation of localized charge sites could separate the redox sites from each other, which thus inhibits the recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs and significantly contributes to the photocatalytic performance enhancement [53,54]. Experimentally, the room-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of all samples exhibit a paramagnetic absorption signal with the g value of 2.0034 (Fig. S25), which can be assigned to the unpaired electrons on sp2-carbon atoms in the π-conjugated aromatic rings [15]. Compared with that of pristine CN, the EPR signal of CN-PUNS is much reduced, which could be due to the formed C-O covalent bonds and reduced unpaired electrons number [54]. When doping with W atoms, the EPR signal of W modified g-C3N4 samples increase, which further confirms the redistribution of electrons and higher concentration of the unpaired electrons in the π-conjugated aromatic rings due to the electron donation from the W atoms, and more free electrons could benefit the production of active radical pairs for photocatalytic reaction [15,55]. Additionally, the UV–Vis diffuse spectra and PL spectroscopy, as well as photoelectrochemical measurements were also employed to investigate the effects of W doping and air-calcination on the light-harvesting ability, charge separation and transfer behavior. It is of great importance to enhance the light-absorption ability of catalyst for exciting more photo-generation electron-hole pairs. Therefore, the optical properties and band gap of all samples were examined and acquired by UV–Vis diffusion spectroscopy measurement and Kubelk-Munk method [56]. Compared with the pristine CN, the WSA-CN-PUNS exhibits a blue shift of the absorption edge, suggesting the increase of its band gap (Fig. S26). The corresponding band-gap energy (Eg ) are estimated to 2.59, 2.64 and 2.61 eV for the pristine CN, CN-PUNS and WSA-CN-PUNS samples, respectively (Fig. S27). In fact, the air calcination enlarges the band gap of g-C3N4 due to the strong quantum confinement effect caused by the reduced thickness of nanosheets [28]. However, after doping with W atoms, the band gap of WSA-CN-PUNS is reduced compared with the CN-PUNS, and shows a very strong tail absorption in the visible-light region. Usually, the tail absorption is attributed to the electronic states in the forbidden band [57], which is coincident with the DFT calculation. The steady-state photoluminescence spectra of pristine CN, CN-PUNS, WSA-CN-PUNS and Wcl-CN-PUNS at 350 nm excitation light (Fig. S28) indicate that, compared with the pristine CN, CN-PUNS shows higher PL peak intensity, which is probably due to the enhanced light harvesting ability due to the multiple light reflections in the porous structures [35]. Notably, the WSA-CN-PUNS and Wcl-CN-PUNS show lower PL peak intensity, suggesting the suppressed photo-generated charge recombination, due to the enhanced separation and mobility of charge carriers in the W modified g-C3N4 system. This may be caused by the mid-gap states induced by W doping that serve as the separation centers to capture the photo-generated electrons, and inhibit the charge carrier recombination. Moreover, the W modified g-C3N4 samples display lower PL peak positions compared with the pristine CN, implying enlarged band gap, which is consistent with the results of UV–Vis diffusion spectroscopy measurement. The time-resolved PL spectra measurements were employed to investigate the charge carrier lifetime (Fig. 5e). All the fitting PL decay data are summarized and listed in Table S7 in the supplementary material. Compared with pristine CN, CN-PUNS sample shows increased average (τ) PL lifetime, suggesting the elongated lifetime of charge carriers by reducing the bulk recombination of electron-hole pairs [27]. Besides, after doping W atoms, WSA-CN-PUNS sample shows a reduced average (τ) PL lifetime compared with the CN-PUNS, which could be ascribed to the accelerated photo-exciton dissociation and mobility in the WSA-CN-PUNS, causing the enhanced spatial transfer of photo-generated carriers from the g-C3N4 matrix to doped W atoms [31]. In addition, the photo-electrochemical measurements were implemented to further investigate the recombination and transfer behaviors of the photo-excited electron-hole pairs. Fig. 5f shows the transient photocurrent curves of pristine CN, CN-PUNS and WSA-CN-PUNS with the reproducible on–off cycles of intermittent visible-light irradiation. Compared to the pristine CN, the CN-PUNS displays an increased photocurrent response because of the reduced size, which can shorten the distance of electron transport from the bulk to the surface. The WSA-CN-PUNS sample exhibits the strongest photocurrent response, implying that the separation efficiency of the photo-generated carriers is enhanced after the W-doping. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed under dark conditions to further reveal the charge transport process of all samples. The CN-PUNS displays a smaller arc radius than that of pristine CN (Fig. S29), suggesting the faster electron diffusion performance compared with the pristine CN, due to the shorter charge carrier transfer path along the open-framework structure. Expectedly, the arch radius of WSA-CN-PUNS is smaller than that of CN-PUNS, indicating that the doping of W atoms could improve the oriented transfer of charge carrier [31]. Finally, the lower valance band position of the WSA-CN-PUNS collected by using the electrochemical Mott-Schottky plot measurements (Figs. S30 and S31) could promote the transfer of photo-generated holes from the catalyst to benzyl alcohol for selective oxidation reaction, which could be contributed to the performance enhancement of bifunctional catalyst. Based on the above results, a tentative mechanism for this photocatalytic system is proposed. Under visible light irradiation, the electrons in VB of g-C3N4 are excited to the CB, which are then rapidly transferred to the W atoms that possess strong ability of storing electrons. With the accumulation of electron around W atoms, the redistribution of photo-excited electrons by the W-N and W-O bonds as bridge results in more electrons are transfer to the neighbor carbon atoms, and then, the Pt nanoparticles near the carbon atoms, loaded by the photo-reduction reaction of H2PtCl6, serve as active sites to initiate the hydrogen evolution reaction."
14,Conclusions,"In conclusion, we prepared W single atom modified porous ultrathin graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (WSA-CN-PUNS) by using the polyprrole-polyoxometalate/g-C3N4 composites as precursors, in combination with a thermal oxidation etching method, which exhibits largely enhanced visible-light photocatalytic H2 evolution performance. Specifically, the WSA-CN-PUNS can deliver a H2 evolution rate of as high as 3.02 mmol h−1 g−1 under visible light, which is about 4.1 and 9.7 times higher than that of un-doped CN-PUNS and pristine CN, respectively. Meanwhile, the WSA-CN-PUNS can act as highly efficient bifunctional catalysts for simutaneous H2 evolution and benzl alcohol selective oxidation, with decent rates of 298.7 and 305.1 μmol h−1 g−1 toward H2 and benzaldehyde production, which are about 3.1 and 2.9 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4. The enhanced performance could be attributed to the synergistic effect of electronic structure modulation and nanostructure engineering. Firstly, the porous nanosheets structure can significantly increase the surface area, provide abundant active sites, and shorten charge transfer distance. Secondly, the W atoms doping adjusts the electronic structure to enhance the visible light absorption, improve the charge mobility and inhibit the recombination of charge carriers. This work highlights a promising approach to prepare a high-efficiency W atoms doped g-C3N4 porous nanosheets photocatalysts, and demonstrates the importance of electronic structure modulation and porous structure construction to improve the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance."
