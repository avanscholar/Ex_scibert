0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2), as the energy carrier with the highest energy density and zero carbon emission, has been one of the most attractive candidates to change the current dependence on fossil fuels [1–3]. Currently, electrocatalytic water splitting is one of the central tasks to exploit green and efficient approaches to H2. However the key challenge comes from the intrinsically sluggish kinetics of anodic water oxidation reaction (WOR, 4OH-→O2 + 2H2O + 4e-, 1.23 V vs. RHE) involving four-electron-transfer process [4,5]. This is not only leads to the energy wastage, but also further increases the cost due to the utilization of noble metal based electrocatalysts. This highly limits the large-scale application. Also a proton exchange membrane (PEM) is introduced to separate the production of H2 and O2. However, the byproducts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can degrade PEM and thus result in premature device failure [6]. This makes the PEM electrolyzer be an expensive approach for large-scale utilization [7]. Hence, it is value to develop alternative strategy different from the high performance WOR electrocatalysts in order to avoid the high energy consumption at the anode and the use of PEM. Recently, in order to solve these problems, researchers have carried out research in two main directions. The first approach involves improvement of the device. For example, there are the researchers who have explored electron coupled proton buffers (ECPB)-based strategy [8–11]. This allows for decoupling of water splitting electrolysis, which prevents gas mixing in the water electrolyzers. However this strategy will undoubtedly not only increase the cost of hydrogen production, but it also requires high overpotential to catalyze WOR. But the product O2 associated with this process is not of high value. The second strategy is to replace the anodic WOR with thermodynamically favorable electrocatalytic oxidation of small molecules. This includes urea [12–15], hydrazine [16–18], benzyl alcohol [19], and biomass-derived intermediate chemicals [20], ethanol [19], furfural [21,22] and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) [6,23]. Among these, oxidation of the biorefinery product 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) can not only significantly decrease the cell voltage for H2, but also offer an important platform chemical substance of the 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) (HMF + 6OH- → FDCA + 4H2O + 6e-) [24–26], which is a monomer to produce important polymeric materials, such as polyethylene terephthalate and poly (ethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate) [24–26]. For example, You et al. have reported that the Ni3S2/NF electrocatalyst can reduce the cell voltage by 200 mV relative to pure water splitting. This can then be integrated with H2 production and HMF oxidation [6]. Stefan recently reported that NixB catalyst with high surface area can enable high efficiency electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF to FDCA [27]. By coupling HER and HMF electrooxidation, the gas phase product is only H2, which avoids the need for intensive gas separation. Besides, under alkaline conditions, a HMF tolerant cathode for efficient HER catalysis is conducive to realize the high Faraday efficiency for membrane-free hydrogen production [6]. Among the transition-metal, nickel based materials are extensively used as cathode materials for water electrolysis in alkaline solution [28–30]. However, strong hydrogen adsorption on nickel limits the intrinsic catalytic activity of metallic Ni towards HER [31,32]. Recently, first-principles calculations have suggested that the interfacial effect between Ni and vanadium oxides can promote the charge redistribution from Ni to vanadium oxides, which greatly weakens the H-adsorption and thus making H2 release free energy over Ni acceptable [24,33]. Herein, we report the electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass compound HMF to value-added products catalyzed by Ni3N-V2O3 under alkaline condition. Accompanying the biomass oxidation at the anode, H2 production can take place at the cathode which also is catalyzed by Ni3N-V2O3 due to its bifunctionality. Compared with the conventional overall water spilling, the step associated with separation of additional gases to prevent H2/O2 mixing is avoided. It should also be noted that Ni3N-V2O3 electrocatalyst can be readily prepared by a simple hydrothermal method followed by nitridation. And the catalyst shows a low overpotential of 53 mV for HER at 10 mA cm−2 due to the doping V2O3 induced electron density modulation. A low overpotential of 230 mV for HmfOR is obtained below 140 mV, which is an improvement over WOR at 10 mA cm−2."
1,Results and discussion,"The synthesis procedure of Ni3N-V2O3 catalyst is shown in the Fig. 1 a. Firstly, Ni/V-based precursors are synthesized using the hydrothermal method. Then, the as-prepared nanosheets are calcined in an NH3 atmosphere to obtain Ni3N-V2O3 (see details in the Supporting Information). The morphology and structures are characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in the Figure S1 , all the diffraction peaks are perfectly consistent with the hexagonal Ni3N phase (JCPDS No. 89–5144). In addition to the peaks indexed for hexagonal Ni3N, additional peaks appear for Ni3N-V2O3 in Fig. 1 b and Figure S1 . This is in agreement with (0 1 2), (1 0 4), (1 1 0), (0 2 4), and (1 1 6) planes of V2O3 phase (JCPDS card No. 84–0318) [34,35]. Investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in Fig. 1 c, the Ni/V-based precursor shows nanosheet morphology. Consistent with the case shown in Fig. 1 d, the smooth surfaces of the Ni/V-based precursors gradually become nanoparticles after nitridation. Interestingly, by comparing Ni3N with different V2O3 samples in Fig. 1 d and Figure S2 ; we found that V is beneficial to the growth of nanosheets. TEM images (Fig. 1 e and Figure S3 ) show the composition of many nanoparticles for V2O3, Ni3N and Ni3N-V2O3 samples, respectively. This is in agreement with the SEM results. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images show well-defined fringes (Fig. 1 f, g) with d-spacing of 0.21 nm and 0.20 nm. This is assigned to Ni3N (0 0 2) and (1 1 1) plane. Close to Ni3N crystal is clearly the V2O3 phase; the fringes with a lattice spacing of 0.27 nm is attributed to the V2O3 (0 0 2) and (1 0 4) planes. This can be further confirmed by the XRD pattern. The EDX element mapping images (Fig. 1 h) show the Ni and N elements are homogeneously distributed on the V2O3. To probe the chemical and electronic states of catalysts, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is performed. Fig. 2 a shows the survey spectrum of Ni3N, V2O3 and Ni3N-V2O3. The signal of Ni, V, N and O elements in the survey spectrum of Ni3N-V2O3 is observed. Fig. 2 b shows the XPS Ni 2p spectrum of Ni3N and Ni3N-V2O3. The low binding energy peak centered at 852.9 eV (2p3/2) and 870.0 eV (Ni 2p1/2) are related to Ni0. The peaks centered at 855.3 and 861.2 eV in Ni 2p3/2 can be identified as the oxidized Ni species and Ni satellite peaks, respectively [36,37]. Obviously, we can find the binding energies of the Ni3N-V2O3 show a positive shift after V2O3 incorporation. The N 1 s spectrum indicates the presence of metal nitride (397.4 eV) and NH (399.4 eV) moieties respectively (Fig. 2 c) [15]. The positive shift of N 1 s caused by V2O3 incorporation is in consistent with Ni XPS result. In Fig. 2 d, the V2p spectrum illustrates that two peaks centered at 515.59 and 522.97 eV are attributed to the spin–orbit splitting of the components - V2p1/2 and V2p3/2 - which is characteristic of vanadium in the + 3 oxidation state [35]. It should be noted that, compared with the V2O3, the binding energies of Ni3N-V2O3 shows a negative shift. This indicates that there is an electron transfer from Ni to V2O3. Figure S4 displays the O1s core-level spectrum, indicating the presence of more than one oxygen atom: the core peaks observed at 530.06 and 531.5 eV can be assigned to the O2– species in V–O and the adsorbed O2 from the atmosphere, respectively [38]. Electrochemical HER tests of as-synthesized Ni3N and Ni3N-V2O3 hybrids are tested and the effects of different amounts of V2O3 on the electrocatalytic properties of Ni3N are investigated. Commercial 20% Pt/C is also studied for comparison. As shown in the Fig. 3 a, the linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) of Ni3N-V2O3 indicates an overpotential of 53 mV at 10 mA cm−2, which is better than the value seen in Ni3N, and closer to the value associated with commercial 20% Pt/C catalysts (47 mV). Interestingly, although V is beneficial to the growth of nanosheets, the increase of the content of V2O3 is not conducive for HER ( Figure S5 ). To illustrate the rate-determining steps, Tafel slopes are calculated in the Fig. 3 b. The Tafel slopes of Ni3N, Ni3N-V2O3 and Pt/C are 206, 63, and 32 mV dec−1 respectively. The Tafel slope of 63 mV dec-1 for Ni3N-V2O3 shows that the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism is the rate limiting step [32]. A comparison of Ni3N-V2O3 with recently reported metal nitrides (Fig. 3 f and Table S1) suggests Ni3N-V2O3 is much better than most non-noble metal nitrides in terms of the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. To elucidate the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity, turnover frequency (TOF) for each active site of Ni are calculated based on the number of accessible Ni sites [39,40]. Fig. 3 c shows a plot of the TOF values of Ni3N and Ni3N-V2O3 versus the potentials. It can be seen that the values of Ni3N-V2O3 are consistently larger. This further confirms the intrinsic superiority of Ni3N-V2O3 for HER catalysis. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is also tested to investigate the charge transfer kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The charge-transfer resistance (R ct) value of Ni3N-V2O3 (21.55 Ω) is much lower than that of the Ni3N (53.52 Ω). This suggests that the hybrid electrocatalysts offer faster charge-transfer kinetics. Finally, to assess the HER durability of Ni3N-V2O3, the long-term durability is performed at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3 e). The initial overpotential of the Ni3N-V2O3 is the same as that in the case of Pt/C. And the electrode of Ni3N-V2O3 presents a much smaller potential increase (11 mV) when compared to Pt/C electrode (102 mV) after 12 h of continuous operation. This is confirmed by TEM (Figure S10); Ni3N-V2O3 maintains nanosheet morphology with crystal lattice of Ni3N and V2O3. 5-(Hydroxymethyl)furfural oxidation reaction (HmfOR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR) are further evaluated in a typical three electrode configuration using 1.0 M KOH and 1.0 M KOH/10 mM HMF as the electrolyte. As displayed in Fig. 4 a, in the absence of HMF for Ni3N and Ni3N-V2O3, Ni2+ to Ni3+ oxidation is observed as a prominent pre-WOR peak at 1.30–1.40 V Vs. RHE. However, the Ni2+ to Ni3+ oxidation peak no longer appears in the presence of HMF (10 mM). It can be observed that the currents rise slowly before the potential of the Ni2+/3+oxidation recorded in the absence of HMF. This indicates that 5-(Hydroxymethyl)furfural oxidation reaction occurs [41]. The formation of the higher oxidation state of the transition metal; in this case Ni3+ is a necessary prerequisite for the electrochemical oxidation of alcohols and aldehydes [42,43]. Compared with WOR in Fig. 4a and Figure S8, the electrochemical HMF oxidation on catalysts all presents an oxidation process at more cathodic potentials. Indeed, the Ni3N-V2O3 achieves a low overpotential of 230 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for HmfOR, compared with WOR. This results in a reduced overpotential of 140 mV. In order to successfully couple HER and biomass oxidation with maximum Faradaic efficiency, the electrocatalyst at the cathode should not only exhibit high preference for HER, but also have a strong tolerance to the presence of selected biomass intermediates. Therefore, we have attempted to evaluate the impact of Hmf on the HER activity of Ni3N-V2O3 under in the absence and presence of 10 mM Hmf. As shown in the Fig. 4 b, the HER polarization curves of Ni3N-V2O3 almost overlapped in the absence and presence of 10 mM Hmf. This indicates that the Ni3N-V2O3 electrocatalyst has strong tolerance to Hmf in the reaction of HER. This can avoid the use of diaphragms. Monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the signal attributed to HMF at a retention time of 7.37 min in Figure S9 continuously decreases in intensity along with the gradual increase of FDCA at a retention time of 2.51 min. Meanwhile as shown in Fig. 4 c, the intermediate products of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) and 5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (FFCA) do not accumulate during the whole reaction, indicating that they are rapidly converted to FDCA [27]. After the theoretical charge (112 min), the final yield of FDCA reaches 96.1% with the selectivity of 98.7% (Fig. 4 d). The high HER performance of the Ni3N-V2O3 electrode and a more cathodic potential oxidation for 5-(Hydroxymethyl)furfural oxidation reaction motivates us to further evaluate the bifunctional catalysis. To further assess its catalytic capability of overall water splitting (OWS) and 5-(Hydroxymethyl) furfural oxidation reaction and integrated HER, the self-supported Ni3N-V2O3/NF electrodes are used as both cathode and anode in 1.0 M KOH and 1.0 M KOH/10 mM HMF electrolyzer, respectively. As shown in the Fig. 4 f, at current densities of 10 mA cm−2, the overpotentials associated with the Ni3N-V2O3 electrocatalyst is only 1.40 V. This is much better than the overpotentials seen in case of Ni3N. The amount of generated H2 matches well with the theoretically calculated amount under total charge during the electrolysis process and the FE is close to 100% for both HER (Fig. 4 e). This further suggests that the Ni3N-V2O3 electrocatalyst has strong tolerance to Hmf. And The electrolyzer demonstrates good long-term catalytic durability, sustaining constant galvanostatic electrolysis for up to 12 h at a controllable current density (10 mA cm−2) with negligible degradation."
2,Conclusion,"We report that the Ni3N-V2O3 hybrid offers excellent bifunctional catalytic performance towards both HER and HmfOR. The interaction between Ni3N and V2O3 results in the transfer of electron from Ni3N to V2O3. In alkaline solution, the low overpotential of 230 mV and 53 mV at 10 mA cm−2 achieved for HmfOR and HER contribute to the excellent performance in the symmetric membrane-free electrolyzer. The voltage at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for hydrogen production is mere 1.40 V. Additional as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, the Ni3N-V2O3 exhibits remarkable activity with a negligible decay after 12 h of continuous operation. This is fundamentally important for efficient hydrogen production."
