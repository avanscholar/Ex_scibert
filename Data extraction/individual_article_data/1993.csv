0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is thought as a future alternative to fossil fuels because it is clean, environmentally friendly and can be produced from various resources [1,2]. Though hydrogen will be produced mostly from renewable energies such as solar power and wind power in the future, it would be produced from fossil fuels such as natural gas in a transition phase to low carbon society because producing hydrogen from fossil fuels is mature and cost effective method. In several fossil fuels, we consider that natural gas is a hopeful candidate as a hydrogen resource because CO2 emission at the hydrogen production process is lowest in the fossil fuels. With commercialization of fuel cell vehicles (FCV), huge number of hydrogen refueling stations is necessary. In that case, on-site hydrogen production from natural gas is thought as one of the most promising method to produce hydrogen at refueling stations because we can utilize existing infrastructure such as pipelines. Currently a combination system of the steam methane reforming (SMR) and hydrogen purification with pressure swing adsorption (PSA) is typical hydrogen production system from natural gas. Though the SMR + PSA system is mature and commercial technology, the system size is still large and the efficiency is not high. Therefore more compact and more effective hydrogen production system is required for the application of hydrogen refueling stations in urban areas. Membrane reactors (MRs) are hydrogen production systems with a hydrogen permeable membrane, and the characteristics are the high hydrogen production efficiency and the compactness. MRs have been studied as a hopeful method for hydrogen production from hydrocarbons and alcohols [3]. In general, the MRs are composed of catalysts for steam reforming and metallic membrane which permeates only hydrogen. MRs can produce and separate hydrogen simultaneously by utilizing the catalyst and the membrane. The following chemical reactions, steam methane reforming and shift reactions, proceed in the MR. (1) CH 4 + H 2 O ↔ CO + 3 H 2 , Δ H o = + 206.2 kJ / mol (2) CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 , Δ H o = − 41.2 kJ / mol In the MRs, produced hydrogen is removed from the reformed gas through the metallic membrane, and as a result, the Reactions (1) and (2) shift toward hydrogen production direction. Consequently, high methane conversion can be accomplished at a lower temperature than conventional reactors which needs reaction temperature of about 800 °C–900 °C for steam methane reforming. In these days, many kinds of MRs have been developed and laboratory tests have been also carried out. For example, Basile et al. developed a Pd–Ag-based membrane reformer system. The system can produce hydrogen with 65% conversion at 450 °C [4]. At Tokyo Gas, we have developed a 40 Nm3/h class membrane reformer (MRF) system for hydrogen production from natural gas and have demonstrated that the system is more compact, more efficient and simpler than conventional hydrogen production system with the SMR + PSA. The detail of the MRF system has been reported in Refs. [5,6]. However, for commercialization of the MRF system, there are two significant issues to be solved. One is the high cost and the other is the long term durability. For these several years, we have been trying to demonstrate the long term durability of the MRF and reduce the MRF cost. To solve the issue about high cost of the MRF system, we have started developing a new concept hydrogen production module with membrane on catalyst (MOC). The MOC module has a potential to reduce the module cost extremely. We have fabricated the MOC module and tested the performance and the long term durability. Those results have already been reported in Ref. [7]. In this paper, we carried out the performance test with MOC module and support only module to clear the complicated mechanism of reforming reaction in the MOC module. To understand the reaction mechanism, it is useful to separate the reforming reaction in the catalyst and the hydrogen permeation at the membrane. From several experimental results, we tried to find the key factor for the high reforming performance of the MOC module."
1,MOC module,"The configuration of the MOC module has already been reported in detail [7]. Here, the configuration and the manufacturing method are explained simply. A thin membrane of a Pd-based alloy is fabricated on a porous ceramic support composed of NiO-8YSZ (8 mol% Yttria stabilized Zirconia). In the MOC module, the porous support itself has a catalytic activity for steam methane reforming reaction. A joint is attached to connect the module to the experimental apparatus. The fabricated module has about 10 mm outer diameter, 300 mm length, about 90 cm2 membrane area and 6–10 μm membrane thickness. Barrier layer composed of dense 8YSZ is inserted between the membrane and the support to prevent the inter-diffusion of the palladium in membrane and Ni in the support. The module has several superior features as shown below. (i) The membrane can be thinner by good plating technique, resulting in reduction of Pd amount and thus module cost. (ii) The thin membrane can enhance the hydrogen permeability and thus increase the hydrogen production performance. (iii) The support works as a catalyst. The module will be more compact. (iv) Well established mass production technologies can be applied for the module production, resulting in the reduction of the module cost."
2,Experimental,
3,Apparatus used for steam methane reforming with MOC module,"3.1 Apparatus used for steam methane reforming with MOC module The MOC module was placed in the reactor vessel made of stainless steel as shown in Fig. 1 . A fuel-feeding tube was inserted into the inside of the MOC module to introduce the fuel gas. Only the hydrogen in the reformed gas permeated through the membrane and went to the outside of the module and then was captured. The off-gas was also captured through a stainless tube connected to the module. The temperature at the module tip was measured with a thermo-couple and controlled as the representative temperature because the reforming reaction occurred most intensively there. In the reforming test, the flow rates of feedstock gases such as water and city gas were controlled with chemical pumps and mass flow controllers. The composition of city gas was 89.6% methane, 5.62% ethane, 3.43% propane, 1.35% butane, and sulfur compounds included in city gas were removed with a de-sulfurizer before the city gas passed through the mass flow controller. The S/C (Steam/Carbon) ratio was 3.0. Water was vaporized at a vaporizer, then the produced steam was mixed with city gas; and the mixed gas was pre-reformed at pre-reforming catalyst set in the pre-heater. It was confirmed that the pre-reformed gas didn't include by-products except CO, CO2, CH4, H2O, H2 by gas chromatograph. Next the pre-reformed gas was introduced into the module inside. The process side pressure, the permeation side pressure and the reaction temperature were treated as experimental parameters. The carbon balance calculated from the molar ratio of CO, CO2, CH4 at the reforming test was nearly 100. So it is clear that the heavy components were cracked at the pre-catalyst. Then the methane conversion was calculated with Equation (3). (3) Conversion ( % ) = C CO 2 + C CO C CH 4 + C CO 2 + C CO × 100 C CH 4 , C C O 2 and C CO are the molar concentration of CH4, CO2 and CO respectively."
4,Evaluation of the hydrogen production capability of the support only module,"3.2 Evaluation of the hydrogen production capability of the support only module Hydrogen production capability of the module without palladium membrane was examined to eliminate the synergetic effect of the membrane and catalytic support. The module had 60 wt% NiO, 10 mm diameter, 300 mm length. Evaluation test was carried out with setup described in Fig. 2 . Methane and water as feedstock gas were introduced into the module and the reformed gas at the catalyst contained in the support was captured by the stainless tube surrounding the fuel feeding tube. This reactor was located in the chamber in Fig. 1. The test was carried out at 550 °C, the reaction pressure was 0.8 MPaG and the flow rate of the feedstock gas was changed to evaluate the reforming performance."
5,Effect of the amount of the catalyst contained in the MOC module,"3.3 Effect of the amount of the catalyst contained in the MOC module To evaluate the effect of the catalyst amount included in the MOC module on the reforming reaction, two kinds of MOC module were manufactured. One had 20 wt% NiO and the other had 60 wt% NiO. Though the catalyst amounts in each module were different, the thicknesses of the membrane and the support and the barrier layer were almost same. The reforming test with two kinds of MOC modules was carried out with the apparatus mentioned above. The experimental condition was 0.8 MPaG of process side pressure, 550 °C. Feedstock gas rate was controlled at 3.0 N cc min−1 cm−2."
6,Evaluation of the effect of the reaction temperature on the hydrogen production of MOC module,"3.4 Evaluation of the effect of the reaction temperature on the hydrogen production of MOC module The reforming reaction at several temperatures was carried out to clear the effect of the reaction temperature on the reforming reaction in the MOC module. It is supposed that the temperature effect on the reforming reaction is very significant. In this test, the module with 60 wt% NiO was used. Here, the process side pressure and the flow rate of the feedstock gas were fixed at 0.8 MPaG and 3.0 N cc min−1 cm−2. The reaction temperature was varied from 510 °C to 550 °C. The specification of the MOC module used for the performance evaluation is as below, hydrogen permeation part 298 mm, outer diameter 9.97 mm, averaged membrane thickness 7.3 μm, membrane area 93.34 cm2."
7,Evaluation of the effect of the reaction pressure on hydrogen production of MOC module,3.5 Evaluation of the effect of the reaction pressure on hydrogen production of MOC module Reforming test at several pressures was carried out to clear the effect of the reaction pressure on the reforming reaction in the module. It is widely known that increasing the pressure decreases the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion; therefore the pressure effect on the reforming reaction is very interesting. The pressure was controlled with a back pressure valve. The range of the pressure was from 0.5 MPaG to 0.8 MPaG. The reaction temperature was fixed at 550 °C and the flow rate of the feedstock gas was fixed at 3.0 N cc min−1 cm−2.
8,Evaluation of the effect of the permeation side pressure on the hydrogen production of MOC module,"3.6 Evaluation of the effect of the permeation side pressure on the hydrogen production of MOC module It is expected that the pressure at the permeation side contributes drastically to the hydrogen production performance because the hydrogen permeation will be promoted by reducing the pressure at the permeation side according to the Sieverts' law. By the increase of the hydrogen permeation, the chemical equilibrium of the Reactions (1) and (2) shifts drastically to the hydrogen production direction. To evaluate this effect, a reforming test with reducing pressure at the permeation side was carried out. The pressure was reduced by the mechanical pump to −0.06 MPaG. Reaction temperature was also varied from 510 °C to 550 °C to confirm the effect of the reaction temperature on the reforming reaction."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Reforming performance evaluation of support only module,"4.1 Reforming performance evaluation of support only module Evaluation test of the reforming performance of the support only module was carried at fuel flow rate 1, 3, 4.5 N cc min−1 cm−2. The conversion at 1 N cc min−1 cm−2 is 25.8% and decreases with the increase of the flow rate of feedstock gas. Conversion at 1 N cc min−1 cm−2 is lower than the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion (27.2%). Calculated space velocity at this flow rate is about 3000 h−1 and it is supposed that SV is low enough to process all of the feedstock gas. This result suggests that the contact time of the feedstock gas against the catalyst included in the support isn't enough despite the enormous catalyst amounts. This consideration is also supported by the result that the conversion decreases with the increase of the flow rate of the feedstock gas (3 N cc min−1 cm−2 24.3%, 4.5 N cc min−1 cm−2 18.3%). It is cleared that the only support can't process the feedstock gas adequately."
11,Catalyst amount effect on the reforming performance of the MOC module,"4.2 Catalyst amount effect on the reforming performance of the MOC module The test result of hydrogen production capability of two kinds of modules which has the different catalyst amount was as below, at the module with 60 wt% NiO, the product hydrogen and conversion were 7.4 N cc min−1 cm−2 and 67.5% and at the module with 20 wt% NiO, product hydrogen and conversion were 5.1 N cc min−1 cm−2 and 53.5% From this result, it is confirmed that the module with 20 wt% NiO doesn't have enough catalyst compared to the module with 60 wt% NiO and it is also cleared that the catalyst amount in the support affects to the reforming performance of the MOC module. Though it is difficult to judge that 60 wt% is optimum value, it is considered that the module shows high reforming performance at the experimental condition. This module is used for following test to evaluate the reforming performance at several experimental conditions because it is easy to compare the performance change between different conditions. On the other hand, it is found that the MOC module has a higher hydrogen production capability than the catalytic support only. Accordingly, the unifying effect of the catalytic support and the hydrogen-permeable membrane is proved."
12,Hydrogen permeability of the MOC module,"4.3 Hydrogen permeability of the MOC module Same module whose membrane thickness is 7.3 μm is used in the following reforming test about reaction temperature, reaction pressure and permeation side pressure. Before the evaluation of the reforming performance, hydrogen permeability is evaluated at 550 °C, process side pressure 0.1 MPaG, permeation side pressure 0.0 MPaG. The permeability is 37.6 N cc min−1 cm−2 and is high enough to apply for the performance test. The hydrogen selectivity of this membrane is about 1000 which is calculated from He leakage amount at process side pressure 0.1 MPaG."
13,Effect of the reaction temperature on the hydrogen production of the MOC module,"4.4 Effect of the reaction temperature on the hydrogen production of the MOC module The temperature range is from 510 °C to 550 °C and it is decided from practical use. The result of the reforming test at several temperatures is shown in Fig. 3 . The conversion, the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion and the product hydrogen amount are plotted in the figure. From this result, it is found that the conversion and product hydrogen amount increase with the temperature. Moreover the variance of conversion rate against reaction temperature is bigger than the variance of thermodynamic equilibrium conversion against reaction temperature. This means that the conversion improvement isn't only from the effect of improvement of the catalyst activity by increased temperature. It is thought that the effect of the hydrogen separation through the Pd membrane multiplies the reforming performance. The temperature relativity of hydrogen permeability of Pd membrane has already been reported in Ref. [8]. Increased hydrogen permeability by the reaction temperature contributes to the shift of the reforming reaction toward hydrogen production. Thus it is assumed that increased temperature affects to the catalytic activity and hydrogen permeability and as a result, total conversion is improved drastically by the synergetic effect of catalyst and membrane. The product hydrogen amount is very small compared with the hydrogen permeability which is measured in the flow of only hydrogen. It is thought that the coexistence gas and the concentration polarization decrease the product hydrogen amount. By removing or decreasing these influences, it is expected that the hydrogen production performance will be improved."
14,Effect of the reaction pressure on the hydrogen production of the MOC module,"4.5 Effect of the reaction pressure on the hydrogen production of the MOC module The results of the reforming test with various process side pressures are shown in Fig. 4 . The product hydrogen amount, the conversion, and the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion are plotted with the reaction pressure. The thermodynamic equilibrium conversion decreases with the increase of the reaction pressure and this result is supported by the chemical equilibrium (1) and (2). Nevertheless, the measured conversion and the amount of the product hydrogen increase gradually with the increase of the reaction pressure. This result means that the positive effect of the hydrogen permeation through the membrane overcomes the negative effect of the decrease of the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion on the hydrogen production capability. Here, this phenomenon is investigated in detail. Fig. 5 shows the hydrogen partial pressure which is calculated from the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion at 550 °C. This pressure is thought as the hydrogen partial pressure at the inlet to the module. Though the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion dropped with the increased pressure, the hydrogen partial pressure increased slightly with the pressure. It is thought that the effect of the reaction pressure contributes to the hydrogen production as below order (a) to (d). (a) Increase of the reaction pressure (decrease of the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion) (b) Increase of the hydrogen partial pressure contained in the pre-reformed gas (c) Promotion of the hydrogen permeation according to the Sieverts' law (d) Shift of the reforming reaction toward hydrogen production Of course, hydrogen permeation from MOC module doesn't follow the Sieverts' law exactly by the influence of the pressure loss of the support; however I confirmed that the hydrogen permeability of MOC module follows the law well. Then it is thought that MOC module can be handled as the dense membrane. From above consideration, the effect of the hydrogen permeation overcomes the decrease of the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion caused by the increased reaction pressure. As a result of this effect, high conversion and product hydrogen amount are accomplished."
15,Effect of the reduced pressure at the permeation side on the hydrogen production,"4.6 Effect of the reduced pressure at the permeation side on the hydrogen production The reforming performance when the pressure of the permeation side is reduced to −0.06 MPaG is shown in Fig. 6 . The conversion measured at several reaction temperatures is plotted in the figure. From this result, the positive effect of the reduced pressure for the conversion rate is obvious. By reducing the pressure at the permeation side, the hydrogen permeation is promoted owing to Sieverts' law and as a result of the improvement of the hydrogen permeation, the conversion is also improved drastically. The enhancement of the conversion by reducing the pressure at the permeation side becomes small with the increase of the reaction temperature. This is because the conversion gets close to the 100% in this experimental condition."
16,Conclusions,"To realize more efficient and compact hydrogen production system, we have developed the new concept hydrogen production module with membrane on catalyst (MOC). In this paper, to evaluate the hydrogen production performance of the MOC module and to clear which factor dominates the effective hydrogen production, reforming tests with the support only module and MOC module at various conditions are carried out. As a result the following results are cleared, • By comparing with support only module, it is cleared that the unifying effect of the hydrogen permeable membrane and the catalytic support on the reforming reaction is noticeable in the MOC module. Hydrogen permeation through the membrane promotes the shift of the reforming reaction toward hydrogen production. • It is found that the MOC module with 60 wt% NiO has an enough activity on the reforming and the hydrogen production performance is as high as the conventional hydrogen production system. This result leads to the compactness of the hydrogen production system. However, it is also found that the module with 20 wt% module doesn't have an enough activity at the fuel flow rate we suppose. • It is found that methane conversion increases with the increase of reaction temperature above the chemical equilibrium in the MOC module. It is thought that improvement of the catalytic activity and hydrogen permeability by the increased temperature promotes the shift of the chemical equilibrium toward the hydrogen production. • It is found that pressure effect on the reforming performance is very noticeable. By the increase of the reaction pressure, partial pressure of hydrogen increases at the process side, and thus the amount of the hydrogen permeation increases. This increase shifts the reforming reaction toward hydrogen production, as a result, the conversion increases drastically. This effect overcomes the negative effect of the chemical equilibrium by the pressure increase. • It is also found that the effect of reduced pressure at permeation side is very noticable. By reduced pressure at permeation side, the hydrogen permeation is promoted according to the Sieverts' law. Improvement of the hydrogen permeation promotes the reforming reaction. As a whole, the effect of the hydrogen permeation affects drastically to the reforming reaction because the distance between the support and the membrane is very close in the MOC module. Furthermore, the maximum hydrogen production permeation is shown at the reaction condition, process side pressure 0.8 MPaG, permeation side pressure −0.06 MPaG, reaction temperature 550 °C when the feedstock gas rate of 3.0 N cc min−1 cm−2 is supplied. By utilizing this module, it is possible to realize more compact and efficient hydrogen production system at mild reaction condition."
