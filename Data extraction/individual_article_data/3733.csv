0,Introduction,"Fossil fuels are currently leading the global primary energy consumption, and this is expected to continue till 2040 with approximately 30% increase in global energy consumption. Liquid fuels will remain the dominant fuel source with increase in natural gas share by 2040 [1]. These energy projections highlight the importance of research efforts on fossil fuels combustion and utilization. Unfortunately, the dependence on fossil fuels accompanied with its depletion along with restrictions on emissions. Therefore, enhancing efficiency of combustion systems, and reducing emissions are main research directions. These include using alternative fuels, fuel additives, and utilization of hydrogen. Fuel additives include liquids as cetane improvers, B20 of methyl esters, methyl ethers, alcohols. Solids in nanoparticles (NPs) form are also considered as fuel additives in metal-based and metal-oxide-based forms. Can et al. [2] studied experimentally the effect of canola biodiesel/diesel blends on CI engine combustion and emissions characteristics. The results indicated a reduction in thermal efficiency of the CI engine for B20 (20%biodiesel – 80% diesel) along with an increase in NOx emissions. While Asokan et al. [3] found that a B20 of Juliflora biodiesel/diesel is the optimum blend that could mimic diesel fuel performance and emissions. Hawi et al. [4] investigated the effect of three different blends of jojoba methyl esters (JME) along with neat diesel on CI engine emissions. It was concluded that the addition of JME led to reduction in NOx emissions and an increase in CO emissions. In a review by Grabowski and McCormick [5], it was concluded that biodiesel has economical gain behind its use in neat or blends form with superior lubricity of these fuels over conventional diesel. This is in addition to reduction in particulate matter (PM) emissions with significant increase in NOx emissions. Another review by Basha et al. [6], it was summarized that the biodiesel has shorter ignition delay, higher peak of heat release and higher ignition temperature compared to diesel with approximately similar brake power. While Mofigur et al. [7] have reported the different advantages and disadvantages of biodiesel and summarized many researches on engine durability. Another alternative fuels that have been extensively studied are alcohols. Xiao et al. [8] showed that the addition of butanol to biodiesel in CI engine lead to prolonged ignition delay along with shortened combustion duration. It reduced the CO and soot emissions while the NOx emissions were increased. This is in agreement with the findings of Ibrahim [9] when butanol was added to B50 (50% diesel + 50% biodiesel), a reduction in thermal efficiency was recorded. Nour et al. [10,11] reported performance and combustion and emissions characteristics of CI engine running with diesel fuel along with higher alcohols including butanol, pentanol, heptanol and octanol along with hydrous ethanol. The higher the alcohol, the higher the brake thermal efficiency with reduction in NOx, CO, smoke and CO2 emissions. Another oxygenated alternative is the diethyl ester (DEE), it was shown that a 10% of DEE in B20 blend led to reduction in brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc) and NOx emissions as reported by [12–15]. Agarwal [16] has summarized the applications of alcohols and biodiesel in CI engines and their effects on combustion characteristics, emissions characteristics and engine wear. The second approach for improving engine performance and emissions is the use of additives. Among different types of additives, the use of fuel-borne catalyst (FBC) is to be highlighted. Metals and their oxides are included in the FBC additives. The size of the FBC is usually in the nanometer range. This ensures enhancement of the heat transfer due to enlargement of the specific surface area, catalytic effect and ability to store energy [17]. Nanoparticles are made from pure metals, carbon-based materials or their oxides. The includes cerium, iron, aluminum, molybdenum, and magnesium. Cerium oxide has been shown to reduce the NOx emissions from CI engines running with diesel/biodiesel blends [18–20], along with reduction of soot ignition’s activation energy and temperature [21]. This agrees with the findings of Keskin et al. [22,23] for molybdenum dioxide, magnesium oxide and ferric chloride and of Nanthagopal et al. [24] for zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. The aluminum oxide (alumina) has drawn attention of many researchers as FBC additives to fuels in CI engines. Shaafi, and Velraj [25] studied experimentally the effect of alumina on performance, combustion and emissions characteristics of CI engine fueled with diesel/biodiesel/ethanol blends. It was concluded that the alumina enhanced the engine performance for the entire load range for the blend case and at high loads for neat diesel. NOx and CO emissions were increased and decreased, respectively. This agrees with the results introduced by Sadhik Basha and Anand [26], Sivakumar et al. [27]. While Sadhik Basha [28] has tested the effect of addition of alumina nanoparticles on neat diesel and the results revealed a reduction on NOx along with CO emissions that matches with the findings of El-Seesy et al. [29] for diesel/biodiesel blends. The third approach is introducing hydrogen-enriched combustion. It was tested with gasoline fuel in spark ignition (SI) engines [30], with diesel fuel in CI engines [31], and with diesel/biodiesel blends in CI engines [32]. An improvement in engine performance was recorded along with reduction in CO emissions and increase in NOx emissions [30–32]. Recently, Juknelevicius et al. [33] demonstrated that the addition of hydrogen with more than 15% led to a significant increase in NOx emissions due to high flame temperature of hydrogen compared to diesel fuel. The main drawback of the hydrogen is its availability. Hydrogen could be provided to engines from water electrolysis [34]. The produced gas could be named Brown’s gas, HHO gas, hydroxy gas, hydroxygen gas, hydroxyl gas or stoichiometric-oxygen-hydrogen (SOH) gas [34]. Al-Rousan [35] introduced the electrolyte’s optimal surface area and volume of water required to generate sufficient amount of SOH is 2000% that of the surface area of piston and 150% that of the engine displacement volume. El-Kassaby et al. [36] tested the effect of introducing HHO gas on fuel consumption and emissions from a Skoda Felicia (1.3 GLXi) gasoline engine. The HHO cell was optimized for number of neutral plates, inter-distance between plates and testing two catalysts; sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and potassium hydroxide (KOH). The optimum design was shown to have 2 neutral plates separated by 1 mm with electrolyte of KOH (6 g/L). More than 30%, 15% and 15% reduction were achieved in fuel consumption, CO emissions and NOx emissions, respectively. Moreover, Yilmaz et al. [37] showed 5% reduction in sfc along with 19.1% reduction in CO emissions for a 4-cylinder CI engine. This is in agreement with the results of Rimkus et al. [38]. The NaOH was recommended to be as the optimal catalyst to diminish the HHO production to avoid severe reduction in volumetric efficiency. Baltacioglu et al. [39] compared the effect of addition of pure hydrogen or HHO to commercial CI engine along with diesel or B10 fuels. The results revealed that B10 + HHO fuel gave the lowest bsfc with the highest NOx emissions compared to diesel, B10 and B10 + H2. This agrees with their recent results for the examination of HHO effect of diesel/biodiesel/ethanol blends [34]. It was also reported that the HHO addition compensates for the reduction in engine power with the addition of microalgae biodiesel to diesel fuel [40]. In a recent paper by Manigandan et al. [41], the effect of coupling between hydrogen and multi-wall carbon nanotube on combustion and emissions characteristics of diesel engine was experimentally investigated. It was concluded that the addition of hydrogen improved the engine performance and emissions characteristics. A comparison between using SOH gas and hydrogen enriched condition with biodiesel was conducted by Ozcanli et al. [42]. The results indicated the SOH gas gave higher fuel efficiency compared to hydrogen enriched condition. This is along with slightly increase in NOx and CO emissions. The produced vibration from engines is also a crucial parameter to study and investigate when dealing with fuel additives along with the combustion, performance and emissions characteristics. In this regard, there are recent research efforts have been done on evaluation of produced vibration with hydrogen/SOH gas as reported by [43,44]. Çalık [43] reported that the addition of hydrogen to diesel/biodiesel blend reduced the engine block vibration. This is in agreement with the results of Çalık and his co-workers [44] for SOH gas impact on vibration of engine block. One could conclude that the HHO addition has an advantage of easy maintenance, availability and feasibility to use over hydrogen. Its impact on engine performance and emissions has been widely investigated and reported. However, the use of two/three approaches that has positive effects on engine performance and emissions parameters has not been widely investigated. Hence, the focus of this manuscript is to present the combined effect of alumina nanoparticles and addition of SOH gas to diesel and B30 fuels on engine performance and emissions parameters. This is considered, to the best of authors’ knowledge, the first study to investigate this combined effect of alumina nanoparticles and SOH gas. The next section presents the engine test-rig, SOH electrolyzer and considered fuels. The impacts of SOH and alumina nanoparticles on engine performance parameter, combustion characteristics and CO and NOx emissions are introduced in Section 3. The main results of the manuscript will be concluded in Section 4."
1,Engine and instrumentations,
2,CI engine test-rig,"2.1 CI engine test-rig Engine Experiments were performed using a 4-stroke, single cylinder, air-cooled, direct injection CI engine (Model: HATZ-1B30-2). The engine is connected to an asynchronous motor (Model: TFCP 132SB-2) for starting up and torque measurement. It is also equipped with air flow and fuel consumption measurement devices. Inlet air flow rate was monitored using orifice meter. Torque was measured using beam load cell sensor (Model: FLINTEC ZLB-200Kg-C3). The weight of fuel column was measured using a pressure transducer fitted below the fuel glass tube. Then, the rate of weight change was used to calculate fuel consumption rate. Additionally, K-Type thermocouples were used to measure temperatures of fuel, exhaust and inlet air. In-cylinder pressure was measured by Kistler piezoelectric pressure sensor model 6052C. Engine speed was measured by a Wachendorff proximity sensor while the location of top dead center (TDC) was identified by a Wachendorff proximity switch. A schematic diagram of the test-rig is shown in Fig. 1 . The data from different sensors was collected using a high-speed data acquisition (DAQ) system (Model: USB-AD16f) which is used to collect data from different sensors of the system. A GUNT software was used to visualize the data and saving them for more post-processing using an inhouse MATLAB code. The CI engine, sensors, asynchronous motor and DAQ system form engine test-rig of Model: GUNT-CT-110. Engine emissions were recorded using exhaust gas analyzer (Model: ECA 450). A steady-state condition was assured after each start by warming up the engine for not less than 20 min. Consecutive runs were also conducted at steady-state condition by monitoring exhaust gas temperature (steady-value). To consider repeatability, each experiment (performance and emissions characteristics) was performed 5 times and the average values were reported. A 100 consecutive cycles of in-cylinder pressure versus crank angle was recorded and averaged. The in-cylinder pressure data was then used to calculate the heat release rate following the approach provided by Heywood [45]. Experiments were performed at constant speed of 2000 rpm and different loads. The speed was chosen to ensure minimal bsfc of the current engine [46]. It is also worthy to mention that the effect of alumina NPs with different engine speeds for B20 of jojoba biodiesel was investigated in [29]. The trend of engine performance and emissions characteristics showed insignificant dependence on engine speed except for the idle speed of 900 rpm. Engine specifications are summarized in Table 1 . More details about the experimental test-rig could be found in [47]."
3,SOH gas generator,"2.2 SOH gas generator The SOH gas was introduced to the intake manifold after the orifice and the air box to assure its closeness to the inlet valve as shown in Fig. 1. The SOH gas generator, used in the current study, was designed, optimized and tested in gasoline engine by El-Kassaby et al. [36] and Elgarhi et al. [48]. An array of 16 electrodes, each with dimensions of 16 × 20 × 0.2 cm, was assembled in an alternate form of anode electrode, 2 neutrals and cathode. Neutrals are to diminish plate voltage and increase the surface area for SOH gas production. The cell was connected to a 12 V DC source. El-Kassaby et al. [36] conducted a comparative study between KOH and NaOH with different concentrations in the electrolyte. It was concluded that KOH with concentration of 6 g/L of distilled water provided the highest efficiency of the SOH gas generator with a constant flow rate of 0.2 l/min. A 2.2-liter tank was used as a water trap and a supply for electrolyte. More details about the SOH gas generator test could be found in [36,48]. The net brake power is calculated as described in [48]."
4,Tested fuels,"2.3 Tested fuels Two main base fuels were used in this study. The first one is diesel fuel that was supplied from local gas station, Alexandria, Egypt. The second base fuel is a blend of 30% biodiesel and 70% diesel hereinafter referred to as B30. The biodiesel was supplied from Alexandria Company for Petroleum Additives (ACPA), located in Alexandria, Egypt. It is originated from waste cooking oil. The alumina nanoparticles were supplied from Sigma Aldrich with 40 nm average size. Various mixtures of base fuels/nanoparticles were studied. Four different concentrations of alumina were mixed with both base fuels using ultrasonication for 30 min. This includes 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg/l of alumina in base fuel. This is referred to herein after as Al25, Al50, Al75 and Al100, respectively. Properties of base fuels are summarized in Table 2 . It is worth mentioning that Suthar et al. [49] has experimentally investigated the effect of alumina nanoparticles on jojoba oil with different weight-based concentrations. It was found that the minimal wear was recorded for 0.1% alumina in jojoba oil."
5,Uncertainty analysis,"2.4 Uncertainty analysis The detailed specifications of different instrumentations uncertainty parameters are presented in Table 3 following Ashour and Elwardany [50]. The analysis is based on the root sum-square approach: (1) U R = ± ∑ i = 1 n ∂ R ∂ x i U t x i 2 , where UR is the uncertainty of the dependent parameter R. It is influenced by n, the number of the independent variables (x). U t x i is the total uncertainty of separate independent variable. These variables include crank angle, fuel flow rate, pressure, torque and speed. The dependent parameters are brake power and brake specific fuel consumption. The total uncertainty of independent variables is calculated using random Ur and systematic Us uncertainties [51]. (2) U t = U s 2 + U r 2 The random uncertainty U r , is calculated following Mofatt [51]: (3) U r ( % ) = ± ( t × S D / N ) / X m × 100 where t is the Student’s t statistics. For 95% confidence level, t = 1.96 and SD is the standard deviation of N repeated measurements. The overall uncertainty is calculated following the procedure described by Mofat [51]. The overall uncertainty in bsfc at load 12 N.m (80% of full load) was found to be ±3.45%."
6,Results,
7,Engine performance,"3.1 Engine performance The effect of addition of alumina nanoparticles and/or SOH to diesel and B30 fuels on CI engine performance has been investigated. The bsfc versus engine load (up to 80% of maximum load) at 2000 rpm is presented in Fig. 2 . For all considered fuels, it is noticed that bsfc decreases with load. This could be ascribed by the fact the thermal efficiency increases with load [45]. Fig. 2a shows that the addition of alumina nanoparticles (NPs) to neat diesel reduces the bsfc. This could be attributed to the catalytic effect of alumina NPs, its oxygen content and high surface area/volume ratio [29]. The latter improves the thermal conductivity and enhances the fuel atomization and evaporation. An average reduction in bsfc of approximately 4.5% and 5.0% was monitored for addition of alumina NPs to neat diesel with concentration of 25 mg/l and 50 mg/l, respectively. It could be also noticed that at low loads and for 75 and 100 mg/l , the bsfc slightly increases compare to those at 25 and 50 mg/l. This could be explained by the enhanced heat transfer that increases the heat loss from engine. For 75 and 100 mg/l concentrations of alumina NPs in neat diesel, the average reduction in bsfc is found to be 6.8% and 6.5%, respectively. Hence, further increase in alumina concentration to 100 mg/l leads to insignificant change in bsfc. This indicates that the catalytic effect on alumina NPs is shown to be dominant over the heat loss effect due to enhanced heat transfer till 75 mg/l concertation of alumina NPs in diesel. A dose of 75 mg/l of alumina in neat diesel is shown to be the optimal value as shown in Fig. 2a. This agrees with the findings of Sadhik Basha [28] for neat diesel fuel. Fig. 2b presents the combined effect of alumina NPs and SOH gas to diesel as a base fuel at 2000 rpm and different engine loads. It depicts that the addition of SOH gas to neat diesel fuel provides a minimal fuel consumption with a 55% average reduction in bsfc compared to this of neat diesel. This could be attributed to the higher heating value of hydrogen that is approximately three times this of diesel fuel. This could be combined with the higher flame temperature of hydrogen in SOH gas that leads to an increase in available energy in the combustion chamber along with high temperature of residual gases [52]. This is in agreement with the findings of Rimkus et al. [38]. This agrees with a recent study by Elgarhi et al. [29] that concluded a reduction of approximately 50% and 40% in bsfc for neat diesel and B20, respectively. Moreover, this is also supported by the results of Singh et al. [53], where they performed a comparative study between different combustion modes. This includes CI, premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI) and reactivity-controlled compression ignition (RCCI). Their results revealed an increase in thermal efficiency for the RCCI mode compared with CI combustion mode. In the RCCI combustion mode, methanol was introduced in the intake manifold while diesel fuel was injected directly inside the chamber. An analogy between their work and the current work could be done, where methanol is replaced by SOH gas noting that the heating value of methanol is one-sixth that of hydrogen. This highlights the significant impact of using SOH gas with neat diesel on reducing fuel consumption. The bsfc was noticed to increase with the addition of alumina NPs to D100-SOH as illustrated in Fig. 2b. This could be attributed to the inhibiting effect of water vapor to the catalytic effect of alumina as discussed by Zhao et al. [54] for methane combustion. Although there is a water separator after the SOH gas generator and before the introduction to intake manifold, it is expected that some of the water will continue its way to the engine. Moreover, the water vapor results from the combustion of SOH gas. Hence, the water vapor increases with the introduction of SOH to the engine. The minimal average increase in bsfc when adding alumina NPs to D100-SOH blend is found to be 88% for 50 mg/l of alumina NPs. Fig. 2c shows that B30 has reduced the bsfc by an average of 20% compared to neat diesel shown in Fig. 2a. The oxygen content in biodiesel and its close properties, as shown in Table 2, to diesel fuel push towards this reduction in bsfc. The addition of alumina NPs with concentrations of 25 and 50 mg/l to B30 as base fuel has no significant effect of bsfc (1% and 3%, respectively). At low loads, the effect of addition of 75 mg/l of alumina to B30 is more pronounced than this at high loads due to the enhanced spray characteristics at low loads. This is in agreement with El-Seesy et al. [29] for B20 (80% diesel/ 20% Jojoba biodiesel). The addition of 75 of alumina NPs to B30 leads to an average reduction of 15.6% compared to B30. Further increase in alumina NPs to 100 mg/l in B30 blend increases the bsfc compared to B30 by approximately 9%. This could be ascribed by the enhanced heat loss caused by improved heat transfer by the extra alumina NPs. Hence, the optimal dose of alumina NPs to B30 is shown to be 75 mg/l. This secures approximately 32% reduction in bsfc when compared to neat diesel. As in the diesel fuel case, the addition of SOH gas to B30 reduced the bsfc by 8% compared to B30 as presented in Fig. 2c and 2d. It could be also seen from Fig. 2d that the addition of alumina NPs to B30-SOH fuel leads to an increase in bsfc. This could be also explained by the effect of water vapor that comes from SOH on inhibiting the catalytic effect of alumina NPs. This effect is big at high percentages of alumina NPs as 75 and 100 mg/l with average increase of 54% and 42%, respectively. This could be explained by the heat loss due enhanced heat transfer by alumina NPs, high temperature of hydrogen combustion and inhibiting effect of water vapor to catalytic effect of alumina NPs."
8,Combustion characteristics,"3.2 Combustion characteristics In this subsection, combustion characteristics including in-cylinder pressure, net heat release rate (HRR), ignition delay and CA50 are presented. Net HRR is calculated using the in-cylinder pressure data and following the approach suggest by Heywood [45]. Ignition delay is defined as the time in CA between start of injection and the first positive value in the net HRR curve, while CA50 is the crank angle position at which 50% of fuel is burnt [55]. This is to explore the effect of alumina nanoparticles and SOH gas on D100 and B30 fuels. Fig. 3 shows the in-cylinder pressure versus crank angle at load 12.0 N.m (80% of full load) for considered fuels. It could be noticed from Fig. 3a that the addition of alumina NPs to diesel fuel leads to insignificant enhancement in peak pressure. This enhancement increases for alumina nanoparticles doses from 25 to 75 mg/l. Fig. 3b shows that there is a reduction in the pressure profile for D100-SOH compared to those of D100-SOH with added alumina NPs in the compression stroke. This could be attributed to the enhanced heat transfer by the alumina NPs that results from absorbing more heat from residual gases. The inhibiting effect of water vapor to the catalytic effect is shown on the peak pressure. The effect of addition of alumina NPs to B30 on in-cylinder pressure is not significant as shown in Fig. 3c. It is revealed that the addition of alumina NPs to B30 leads to an 0.8% reduction in peak pressure. This agrees well with the findings of El-Seesy et al. [29] for a blend of diesel and Jojoba-based biodiesel at high loads and high speeds. Introducing the SOH gas to an engine working with B30 fuel leads to an advancement in pressure profile along with a slight reduction in peak pressure by approximately 1%. This could be attributed to the less reactivity of hydrogen compared to B30 [52]. It could be also observed that the addition of SOH gas to B30 blends with alumina NPs leads to a negative effect of in-cylinder pressure. This could be ascribed to the negative effect of water vapor on the catalytic effect of alumina NPs [54]. This agrees well with the diesel results shown in Fig. 3a and b. Fig. 4 shows the heat release rate (HRR) for the considered fuels at the same conditions of Fig. 3. It could be seen from Fig. 4a that the addition of alumina NPs to neat diesel as base fuel leads to a higher peak in the HRR. This is a result of catalytic effect of alumina NPs. It could be noticed that the rate of change in HRR for D100-SOH fuel is larger than those when alumina NPs is added as shown in Fig. 4b. This agrees with in-cylinder pressure shown in Fig, 3b. This could be explained by the high energy content of hydrogen in case of D100-SOH gas and the inhibiting effect of water vapor to expected high reactivity in the existence of alumina NPs. Fig. 4c indicates that there is no significant impact of alumina NPs when added to B30 in net HRR. On the other hand, there is a noticeable effect when the base fuel is B30-SOH as shown in Fig. 4d. This difference is associated with the increase in the bsfc as shown in Fig. 2d. Fig. 5 depicts the burn rate using the CA50 for considered fuels at 2000 rpm and different loads. The CA50 is shown to increase with load as more fuel is injected. This means more time is required to burn it. Fig. 5a presents the CA50 for diesel and diesel with alumina NPs. It is noticed that the alumina NPs slightly increase the CA50. This indicates a longer combustion duration for diesel with NPs compared to neat diesel. This could be an indication of a complete combustion process as a result of catalytic effect of alumina NPs. The addition of SOH gas to diesel fuel decreases the CA50 as an indication of rapid combustion process and high burn rate as shown in Fig. 5b. This is a result of high flame temperature of hydrogen that enhances the combustion of intermediate of heavier fuel. This highlights the significant effect of adding SOH to neat diesel. The effect of SOH to diesel with alumina NPs, as presented in Fig. 5b, illustrates that the addition of SOH to diesel with alumina NPs reduces the burn rate. This agrees well with the in-cylinder pressure and HRR data shown in Figs. 3b and 4b, respectively. The burn rates of B30 set of fuels is shown to be slower than those of neat diesel as presented in Fig. 5a and 5c. This could be related to the higher mean bond energy in ester group compared to this of CH group [52]. It is also noticed that the addition of alumina NPs to B30 leads to an increase in CA50 as for neat diesel fuel. This matches with the effect of alumina NPs on CA50 of diesel as a base fuel. The addition of SOH gas to B30 with alumina NPs leads to an enhancement in burn rate as shown in Fig. 5d. It could be also summarized that the addition of alumina NPs to any of the considered base fuel leads to a slight increase in CA50 as presented in Fig. 5a-d. Fig. 6 shows the ignition delay of considered fuels at different loads and 2000 rpm engine speed. A general trend of reducing the ignition delay with load is obvious and could be related to the increase in residual gases temperature and quantity with load as a result of increased amount of fuel. As shown in Fig. 6a, the addition of alumina NPs to neat diesel is shown to decrease the ignition delay due to enhanced atomization, vaporization, and heat transfer processes. This trend is followed for alumina NPs up to 75 mg/l, a further increase in its concentrations leads to a slight increase in ignition delay. This could be ascribed by the over enhancement in heat transfer. This increases heat losses and therefore the ignition delay increases. This also has been noticed for B30 as a base fuel in Fig. 6c. Comparing Fig. 6b and c, it could be seen that the trend of the effect of alumina nanoparticles on either diesel or biodiesel looks similar with more pronounced increased in ID for the case of biodiesel with high concentrations of alumina NPs in it. There are many competing phenomena that affects the ignition delay for the case of biodiesel blend with alumina NPs. These include heat transfer enhancement inside the droplet, heat transfer enhancement inside the combustion chamber, high molecular weight of the biodiesel, catalytic effect of alumina NPs and oxygen content in biodiesel. The existences of alumina NPs enhances droplet evaporation due to enhanced heat transfer inside the droplet. This leads to formation of clouds of fuel vapor (biodiesel and diesel) with higher molecular weight than that of diesel fuel only. This results in a reduction in the mass diffusivity of air in these clouds and reduce quality of mixing between air and fuel vapor [56]. Thus, an increase in ignition delay is monitored for higher concentrations of alumina NPs. These results are supported by the findings reported by El-Seesy et al. [29] for B20 of jojoba biodiesel and diesel. One could also notice that the ignition delay of B30 is shorter than this of neat diesel. This could be attributed to the available oxygen in biodiesel. At low loads, the addition of alumina NPs to D100-SOH slightly decreases the ignition delay while at high loads, the ignition delay increases with the addition of alumina NPs. This could be related to the increase in heat loss associated with high loads."
9,Nox emissions,"3.3 Nox emissions NOx emissions versus load are shown in Fig. 7 for different considered fuels at different engine loads and speed of 2000 rpm. It could be seen that the NOX emissions increases for all different fuels with load. This may be ascribed to the excess fuel quantity associated with high load that leads to higher temperatures inside the combustion chamber. This is also could be attributed to the higher temperature of residual gases with the engine load that increases the temperature inside the chamber. Fig. 7a shows that as the alumina NPs concentration increases, the NOx emissions increase as well. The average increase at 12.0 N.m is found to be approximately 12%. This could be explained by the enhanced combustion due to the catalytic effects of NPs. Fig. 7b presents the effect of adding alumina NPs to D100-SOH fuel. Comparing Fig. 7a and b, one could observe that the SOH gas decreases the NOx emissions. It could be noticed that the alumina NPs leads to an increase in NOx emissions. The minimal NOX emissions are recorded for D100-SOH. The addition of SOH to neat diesel leads to a 28% average reduction in NOX emissions. This highlights the role of SOH gas in reduction NOX emissions. As previously discussed, the SOH gas increases the water vapor and this in turns reduces NOX emissions as an exhaust gas recirculation-like (EGR-like) effect. The specific heat of water vapor is approximately double this of air over a wide range of temperatures (300–1000 K) [57]. Hence, the existence of hydrogen leads to an extra amount of water vapor that absorbs heat from combustion chamber preventing excessive increase in its temperature and therefor diminishes the NOx formation. The addition of alumina NPs to D100-SOH enhances heat transfer inside the combustion chamber and increases NOx emissions. This agrees with the ignition delay results shown in Fig. 6b. It could be seen from Fig. 7c that the addition of alumina NPs to B30 leads to an increase in NOX emissions. The excess oxygen provided by the nanoparticles along with the enhanced reactivity of fuel/air mixture could be the reason behind this. This agrees well with the findings of Soudagar et al. [58]. One could compare Fig. 7a and 7c to conclude that B30 emits 17% higher NOx emissions than those emitted when using neat diesel over the entire load range. This could be attributed to the excess oxygen existing in biodiesel that enhances the NOX formation. The addition of alumina NPs to B30 leads to an average increase in NOx emissions by 0.5%, 3.7%, 4.7% and 16.25% for 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg/l, respectively. It could be extracted from Fig. 7d that the SOH gas leads to an average decrease in NOX emissions by 12% at low-to-medium loads while at high loads, the SOH gas increases the NOX emissions by an average of 18%, as could be seen in Fig. 7c and d. This could be illustrated by the low temperatures associated with low loads cases that retard the combustion of hydrogen and keeps the water vapor without dissociation. This leads to more water vapor inside the chamber and low combustion temperature. This is in agreement with the conclusions of Baskar and Kumar [59] regarding the effect of water vapor on NOX emissions. For the case of adding alumina NPs to B30-SOH, the NOx profiles are scattered with load and alumina NPs concentrations. There are two competing phenomena, the first one is the enhanced reactivity by the existence of alumina NPs. This leads to a higher temperature inside the combustion chamber that increases NOX emissions. The second phenomenon is the inhibiting effect of water vapor to the catalytic effect of alumina nanoparticles along with the EGR-like effect of water vapor on NOX emissions. At low loads for B30-SOH base fuel, the addition 25 mg/l of alumina NPs to it as a base fuel results in an increase in NOX emissions. This indicates that a pronounced catalytic effect of alumina nanoparticles at low temperatures in agreement with El-Seesy et al. [29]. At higher loads and low concentration of nanoparticles, a reduction in NOX emissions were deduced. This shows the dominancy of inhibiting effect of water vapor to the catalytic reactivity of alumina nanoparticles. This effect is shown to be shifted to high load only with higher concentration of alumina NPs. This demonstrated the superiority of inhibiting effect due to water vapor and EGR-like effect over the catalytic effect of alumina NPs at this load. It is worth mentioning that the SOH gas concentration was kept constant."
10,Conclusions,"The combined effect of using SOH and alumina NPs on diesel engine performance and NOx emissions was investigated. This was carried out using a single cylinder, 4-stroke, air-cooled, direct injection diesel engine. D100 and B30 were considered as base fuels. Four concentrations of alumina NPs were investigated (25, 50, 75 and 100 mg/l). The SOH flowrate was kept constant at 0.2 l/min. The results revealed that the optimal alumina NPs concentration in D100 and B30 is 75 mg/l. The largest reduction in bsfc was recorded for D100 with SOH gas with a 55% average reduction. The combination of SOH and alumina NPs increased the bsfc. The addition of SOH gas to B30 reduced bsfc by 8% compared to B30. The addition of alumina NPs to B30-SOH fuel increased bsfc. A 12% increase in NOx emissions was noticed with the addition of alumina NPs while a 28% reduction was noticed with the addition of SOH to D100. Scattered profiles of NOx were noticed for B30 and B30-SOH base fuels. It is also recommended to investigate the effect of this combination of SOH gas and alumina NPs on different operating parameters of engine at different engine speeds. The impact of this combination on soot reactivity and nanostructure is a future point of research."
