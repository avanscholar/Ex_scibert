0,Introduction,"With the rapid development of biomass conversion in recent years, numerous bio-based carboxylic acids, such as levulinic acid (LA), succinic acid, lactic acid and itaconic acid have been emerged as versatile platform chemicals [1,2]. Reduction of carboxylic acids to alcohols, particularly for diols, is industrially important because the generated alcohols are intermediates for a variety of polyesters, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and fine chemicals [3,4]. e.g. 1,4-butanediol is an important commodity chemical to produce valuable polymers over 2.5 million tons annually, and it is currently manufactured through the feedstocks from fossil resources [5,6]. Thus, the development of a green and cost-effective approach is highly desirable to synthesize alcohols via the reduction of biomass-derived carboxylic acid. Currently, the production of alcohols from carboxylic acids has been performed using stoichiometric quantities of strong reducing agents including toxic metal hydrides or silanes [7], which inevitably results in serious environmental issues. In recent years, much progress has been made in the use of homogenous Ru and Ir or heterogeneous Ru, Rh, Pd and Pt-based catalysts for carboxylic acids hydrogenation [8–12]. Nevertheless, it is still a grand challenge to effectively perform hydrogenation of carboxylic acids by cheaper, more abundant and less toxic base metals (such as Co, Fe, Ni and Cu). Compared to ketones and esters, carboxylic acids are difficult to reduce by H2 owing to the low electrophilicity of carbonyl carbon [7]. Additionally, the strong acidity of carboxylic acids can seriously corrode and damage base metals, leading to detrimental catalyst deactivation. Very recently, Bruin et al. [13] have reported the first earth-abundant homogenous Co(BF4)2·6H2O catalyst capable of hydrogenating a series of functionalized carboxylic acids to alcohols with superior activity. Encouragingly, it is anticipated to design a highly active heterogeneous Co-based catalyst to overcome strong acidity and inert carboxyl groups. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are usually consisted of base metal and organic ligands with porous and tuneable structure. Recently, MOFs have emerged as promising self-sacrificing templates for synthesizing some metals nanoparticles (NPs), oxides, carbon or their composites via simple pyrolysis [14–20], enabling to tailor their compositions, shapes and phase structures by tuning MOFs sources, preparation conditions or postsynthetic modifications. For example, Beller et al. [18] have fabricated Co and Co3O4 composite NPs encapsulated by graphitic shell via the pyrolysis of cobalt-diamine-dicarboxylic acid MOFs under inert Ar atmosphere, which are broadly effective in reductive amination. Additionally, more complex MOFs-related Co-based catalysts have been created, such as Co-CoO@N-doped porous carbon [21], CoS2 nanobubble hollow prisms [22], or Co3O4@NiCo2O4 double-shelled nanocages [23], which may offer us potential opportunities to fabricate highly stable Co NPs to tolerate carboxylic acid. The catalytic performances of metal NPs are highly dependent on their crystal structure, so-called structure sensitivity [24,25]. Metal Co possesses two crystallographic structures, i.e. metastable hexagonal closed-packed (hcp) phase and thermodynamically stable facc-centered cubic (fcc) phase. The hcp and fcc Co have different bulk symmetries and structure, and thus lead to expose distinct facets, which directly influences catalytic performance. Using conventional approaches such as impregnation, precipitation or sol-gel, the synthesized Co-based catalysts are composed of fcc Co or their mixed phases after the reduction of their precursors Co3O4, CoO or spinel by H2 [26,27]. Although many researchers argue that hcp Co is more active than fcc phase in their mixed catalysts, such as well-known Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, the intrinsic active phase is still in great debate for decades owing to the significant challenge for the synthesis of single hcp Co phase [25,28,29]. In this context, we made a try to pyrolyze MOF precursor of Co3[Co(CN)6]2 in reductive atmosphere. Unexpectedly, the single phase hcp-Co NPs were obtained and encapsulated by few-layer graphene. The as-prepared hcp-Co exhibited enhanced performance in one magnitude in comparison to fcc-Co in carboxylic acid hydrogenation. Combined with in situ diffuse reflection Fourier transform infrared spectra (DRIFTS) model reaction of acetic acid hydrogenation and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results, the reaction mechanism of carboxylic acid hydrogenation have been disclosed, in which dehydroxylation is identified as a key step in the formation of alcohol."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation 0.04 mmol K3[Co(CN)6] (J&K Scientific Ltd.) and 0.3 g polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Aladdin) were first dispersed in 10 mL water under vigorous stirring. Then, 10 mL 0.0075 mol/L Co(NO3)2·6H2O (Aladdin) aqueous solution was dropwisely added at room temperature. After stirring for 10 min, the mixed solution was transferred into Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and kept at room temperature for 24 h. The solid was collected by centrifugation, washed with water and ethanol, and dried at 80 °C overnight. Finally, these collected solids were pyrolyzed at 300, 400, 500, 600 or 700 °C in 10 vol% H2/Ar gas for 6 h, and passivated in in 1 vol% O2/Ar gas at room temperature for 2 h. The as-prepared catalysts were designated as hcp-Co@GT, where T refers to annealing temperature. G400 was synthesized by the treatment of hcp-Co@G400 with 98% sulfur acid at 180 °C for 24 h, followed by centrifugation, washing and drying at 80 °C overnight. The fcc-Co@G400 catalyst was prepared as follows: certain amounts of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China (SCRC)), 0.3 g PVP, and 0.8 g G400 were successively added into 10 mL water under vigorous stirring for 1 h. The collected solid was separated by centrifugation, dried and annealed in 10 vol% H2/Ar at 400 °C for 6 h. The Cu@G400, Ni@G400 or Fe@G400 catalysts were prepared with the same method as above."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded at −196 °C on a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 instrument. Before the measurements, all the catalysts were pretreated under vacuum at 250 °C for 8 h under high vacuum condition. The Co contents were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) apparatus (Optima 2100DV, PerkinElmer). Prior to the measurements, the samples were heated at 700 °C for 2 h in air, and treated with hydrochloric acid at 120 °C for 12 h. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and in situ XRD were conducted on a D8/max-X-ray diffractometer (Brucker, Germany) operating with Cu Khcp radiation. In situ XRD patterns of Co3[Co(CN)6]2 were recorded at different temperature and time with a heating rate of 5 °C/min in flowing 10 vol% H2/Ar gas. In situ diffuse reflectance ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectra were performed at Agilent Cary 5000 UV–Vis-NIR spectrophotometer equipped with a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) integrating sphere. During the measurements, Co3[Co(CN)6]2 was heated to 400 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min and kept at this temperature for 6 h in flowing 10 vol% H2/Ar gas. Raman spectroscopy was carried out on a Renishaw-UV–vis Raman System 1000 instrument using a CCD detector at room temperature. The 532 nm of Nd:YAG laser was employed as the excitation source with a power of 30 MW. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) measurements were taken on a field-emission transmission electron microscopy (FETEM, JEM-2011F) operating at 200 kV voltages. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured on a VG MiltiLab 2000 spectrometer with Mg Kα radiation and a multichannel detector. The binding energies were calibrated using the C1s peak at 284.5 eV. The reduced catalyst is obtained by in situ treating the passivated sample at 300 °C for 2 h in a 10 vol% H2/Ar flow. Co K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was performed in fluorescence mode at the beam line of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF), Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP), Chinese Academy of Science (CAS). XAS spectra was processed in Athena XAS version 0.8.056 software, in which background subtraction and normalization were fitted linear polynomials to the pre-edge and post-edge regions of absorption spectra, respectively. The E0 value was calculated based on the maximum value in the first derivative of the edge region. In situ DRIFTS was carried out in a FTIR spectrophotometer (Nicolet Is10) operating with a SMART collector and an MCT detector cooled in liquid N2. 40 mg catalyst was initially pretreated at 300 °C for 2 h in H2/Ar gas (20 mL/min), and cooled down to room temperature in Ar gas. Subsequently, acetic acid was introduced into the catalyst surface and gradually reached in saturated state, which was monitored by DRIFTS spectra. With increasing temperature to 220 °C, the adsorbed acetic acid began to desorb from the catalyst. Once the DRIFTS spectra of adsorbed acetic acid kept stable, H2 (20 mL/min) was introduced into the system and the DRIFTS spectra were simultaneously collected."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests Before the reaction test, the catalyst was activated in 10 vol% H2/Ar at 20 mL/min in 300 °C for 2 h. Unless otherwise specified, 1 mmol substrate, 0.05 g catalyst and 5 mL H2O were charged into a stainless steel autoclave (NS-10316L, Anhui Kemi Machinery Technology Co., Ltd.). The reactor was sequentially purged with H2 for 5 times, pressured to 5.0 MPa H2, heated into 220 °C, and kept at this temperature for 24 h. After the reaction, the reaction system was quickly cooled to room temperature in an ice-water bath. After separation, the liquid products were analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2010) with a flame ionization detector. 1,2-butanediol was used as an internal standard for the formation of diol, while 1-butanol was applied in the case of monohydric alcohol. The insoluble reactants and products in water were extracted by ethyl acetate, and analyzed with ethyl benzoate as internal standard. Diethyl ether was used as extract in the conversion of stearic acid and palmitic acid. The gas products were analyzed by Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph equipped with a TCD detector. All the products were identified by a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 gas chromatogram–mass spectrometer (GC-MS) and NMR spectroscopy (Bruker AV-III 400 MHz NMR spectrometer). The turnover frequency (TOF) in the conversion of acetic acid was calculated based on surface Co atoms at low conversion. The surface Co atoms were estimated on total Co atoms and Co dispersion. According to previous report [30], Co dispersion (D) can be calculated by the equation D = 96/d, in which d refers to Co mean particle size in nm from TEM counting. T O F = Mole n u m b e r o f c o n v e r t e d a c e t i c a c i d Number o f s u r f a c e C o a t o m s × r e a t i o n t i m e In the catalytic reusability tests, the used hcp-Co@G400 catalyst was magnetically separated from the reaction mixture. The collected catalyst was directly reused for the next run."
5,DFT calculation,"2.4 DFT calculation Periodic DFT calculations were performed in Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) with projector-augmented wave (PAW) method [31]. Exchange and correlation energies were treated with spin-polarized generalized gradient approximation and Perdew, Burke, and Ernzcrhof (PBE) functional [32]. A plane wave energy cutoff was set as 450 eV, and a 4 × 4 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack k-points were used. The hcp Co (002) and fcc Co (111) surfaces were modeled by a four-layer slab with 3 × 3 unit cell. A 15 Å vacuum layer was set between the slabs to avoid interlayer interactions along z-direction. The top two layers of Co atoms and adsorbates were fully relaxed, while the bottom two layers were fixed during the calculation. The adsorption energy (Eads) are defined as the equation Eads = Eads/slab − Egas − Eslab, in which Eads/slab, Eads and Eslab are the energies of the adsorbate with slab, adsorbate in the gas phase, and the clean slab, respectively. The transition states calculations were implemented by climbing image nudge elastic band (CI-NEB) method [33]. All the transition states were validated by vibrational frequency analysis. The activation energy barrier (Ea) and reaction energy (Er) were determined by Ea = ETS − EIS and Er = EFS − EIS, wherein EIS, ETS, and EFS are the energies of the initial state (IS), transition state (TS) and final state (FS), respectively."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Fabrication of hcp-Co@G and structure characterization,"3.1 Fabrication of hcp-Co@G and structure characterization Prussian blue analogues (PBA) are one of the most extensively explored MOFs for their uniform sizes, special thermal properties and unique reactivity [34,35]. A series of core-shell structure catalysts were prepared by pyrolyzing PBA-structured Co3[Co(CN)6]2 NPs at different temperature in 10% H2/Ar flow. As illustrated in Fig. 1 , the TEM and HRTEM images show that all the uniform Co NPs in hcp-Co@G400 are well encapsulated by ultrathin graphene shell. Considering its ultrahigh Co content up to 63.1% (Table 1 ), the average Co particle size of 8.8 nm indicates its formation of rather homogenous Co NPs. The formation of metastable hcp-Co can be identified by its (111) lattice fringe of 0.202 nm [26], and no fcc Co is detected. Statistical analysis of more than 300 core-shell nanocomposites confirms that the number of graphene shell is only consisted of 2–5 layers. Careful observation in HRTEM images show that the graphene layers outside Co NPs are not totally closed, and some cracks in 0.2–0.8 nm can be found. The annealed samples were fiercely oxidized once it exposed to air, implying that O2 molecules can freely pass through graphene layers via cracks to react with hcp-Co species. Notably, these cracks play a decisive role in exposing active Co facets for catalytic reaction. For other samples annealing at 300, 500, 600 and 700 °C (Figs. S1–S4), all the hcp-Co NPs are well covered by graphene shell, despite with many cracks. The increased pyrolysis temperature improves Co particle size, graphene layers and graphitization degree, but correspondingly declines graphene defects and cracks. For Co@G300, the presence of both hcp-Co and Co3[Co(CN)6]2 species in XRD patterns indicates that Co3[Co(CN)6]2 is not completely decomposed at 300 °C, as supported by its low Co content but high N content (Table 1). The BET surface area of hcp-Co@G300 reaches 332.4 m2/g and is much higher than other high temperature samples, also suggesting that it contains some remaining Co3[Co(CN)6]2 species. As displayed in Fig. 2 a, the diffraction reflections at 17.4°, 24.7°, 35.2°, 39.5° and 51.4° are ascribed to Co3[Co(CN)6]2 over hcp-Co@G300 [34]. The reflections at 41.4°, 44.5° and 47.4° are assigned to (010), (002) and (011) planes of hcp-Co phase [26]. Both Co3[Co(CN)6]2 and hcp-Co species are co-existed in hcp-Co@G300, suggesting the incomplete decomposition of Co3[Co(CN)6]2. The diffraction peaks of hcp-Co gradually increase in intensity with increasing annealing temperature, indicating a steady growth of Co particle size. The increase of Co particle size is also supported by TEM statistical analysis. Additionally, TEM and XRD results show that (002) plane is the most exposed facet in all the hcp-Co@G catalysts. The Raman spectra of all the samples are illustrated in Fig. 2b. The well-resolved two bands at 1344 and 1574 cm−1 are assigned to D and G bands, respectively [15,21].The D band is associated with defects or discorded carbon, while G band refers to sp2-hybridized graphitic carbon [15]. The hcp-Co@G300 catalyst show very low intensity of D and G bands owing to the preservation of substantial Co3[Co(CN)6]2. The relative intensity of IG/ID is indicative of graphitization degree. For other samples, the IG/ID ratio increases with increasing annealing temperature and indicates an improved graphitization degree, coincident with the enhanced graphene layer number [21]. Unexpectedly, pure hcp Co NPs are successfully fabricated and remain stable even at high temperature up to 700 °C, which has never been reported. The hcp Co is only stable below the allotropic transformation temperature (420–450 °C), whereas the fcc structure is thermodynamically stable above this temperature [36]. Previous studies [28,29] have shown that the control synthesis of pure hcp-Co is a great challenge when the preparation process needs high temperature thermal treatment. Thus, the formation mechanism of graphene encapsulated hcp-Co species was necessarily probed by in situ UV–vis spectra and in situ XRD (Fig. 3 a,b and Fig. S5). In comparison with XRD, UV–vis spectroscopy is more sensitive to detect surface or minor metal cation species. Fig. 3a in UV–vis spectra show that the as-prepared Co3[Co(CN)6]2 displays many peaks at 250, 320, 528, 600, 638 and 690 nm, which are associated with Co2+ and Co3+. When the annealing temperature enhanced from 30 °C to 100 °C, the presence of very strong adsorption band at 587 nm is ascribed to the isolated mononuclear octahedral Co2+ [37], originating from the decomposition of Co3[Co(CN)6]2. A moderate decline in characteristic peak intensity of Co3[Co(CN)6]2 is also observed in in situ XRD pattern (Fig. 3b) at 100 °C. The characteristic band of isolated Co2+ is still detected up to 400 °C at UV–Vis spectra. Simultaneously, new XRD diffraction reflections at 41.3°, 42.6° and 45.2° appear, which are assigned to Co2C crystalline [38]. With increasing annealing time (Fig. S5) or temperature (Fig. 2b), the Co2C characteristic peaks disappear both in UV–vis spectra and XRD patterns. Since then, no any obvious peaks are detected by UV–vis spectra, reflecting that there is no oxidized Co species. Indeed, only reduced hcp-Co species diffraction reflections are detected by XRD. The above results indicate that the Co2C from Co3[Co(CN)6]2 decomposition is rapidly reduced into metastable hcp-Co. Metallic hcp-Co NPs can catalytically promote the growth of graphene around their edges, and are further confined in graphene shell. The core-shell structure can inhibit the occurrence of allotropic transformation of hcp-Co into fcc-Co below 700 °C. XPS spectroscopy (Fig. S6) analysis, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES, Fig. 3c), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS, Fig. 3d) were employed to determine the chemical states and coordination of the Co atoms in hcp-Co@G catalysts. As displayed in Fig. S6, hcp-Co@G400 and other high temperature samples present two peaks at around 778.5 and 793.5 eV, which are assigned to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 spectra of metallic Co0 [21], respectively. The spent hcp-Co@G400 still displayed only Co0 characteristic peaks, indicating that Co0 active sites kept stable during the reaction. For hcp-Co@G300, another two broad peaks at 782.1 and 797.3 eV are associated with Co2+/3+ of Co3[Co(CN)6]2. Except for hcp-Co@G300, all the hcp-Co@G catalysts show similar XANES spectra as Co foil (Fig. 3c), suggesting that Co species are only existed as metal state. The EXAFS results show that only CoCo bonds were detected for the above samples, consistent with XPS results for the detection of Co0. In the case of hcp-Co@G300, its pre-edge peak is located at 7710.5 eV, lower than that of Co foil (7711.4 eV) and higher than that of Co3O4 (7709.0 eV). This suggests that it contains different types of Co species. The preservation of CoN bond is verified by its bond length of 1.42 Å over hcp-Co@G300 in EXAFS [39]. Combined with XANES, EXAFS, and XRD results, it can be deduced that both undecomposed Co3[Co(CN)6]2 and hcp-Co are present in the hcp-Co@G300."
8,Catalytic performance for carboxylic acid hydrogenation,"3.2 Catalytic performance for carboxylic acid hydrogenation LA and acetic acid are two of the most important biomass-related carboxylic acids [40,41]. Therefore, these two acids are selected as model compounds for hydrogenation at 220 °C and 5.0 MPa H2. According to the reaction pathway of LA hydrogenation (Scheme S1), the reduction of carbonyl and carboxylic group is competitive, and the product distribution is highly dependent on catalyst composition. As shown in Fig. 4 a and Table S1, all the hcp-Co@G catalysts exhibited complete LA conversion but with various 1,4-pentanediol (1,4-PDO) yields, because carbonyl group are much more easily reduced than carboxylic group in LA. Hcp-Co@G300 gave 29.9% yield of target product 1,4-PDO along with a variety of by-products, including 19.1% γ-valerolactone (GVL), 11.7% 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran (MTHF), and 3.1% 1-pentanol. The poor 1,4-PDO yield of hcp-Co@G300 is primarily ascribed to its low hcp-Co content, originating from the incomplete decomposition of Co3[Co(CN)6]2. Of all the examined catalysts, hcp-Co@G400 exhibited dramatic enhancement in 1,4-PDO yield, reaching 89.5%. However, an increase of annealing temperature gradually declined the yield of 1,4-PDO as a result of increased GVL yield. Because these catalysts cannot effectively reduce carboxylic into hydroxyl group, the intermediate product 4-hydroxyl pentanoic acid (HPA) cannot be converted into 1,4-PDO but undergoes lactonization to form GVL. Additionally, we used sulfuric acid to completely etch Co species from hcp-Co@G400 in order to prepare G400 support. ICP-AES result confirmed that the hcp-Co species had been totally removed. The G400 support was nearly inactive for LA conversion (Table S1). Subsequently, 20fcc-Co@G400 and 60fcc-Co@G400 catalysts were prepared from Co(NO3)2·6H2O with similar methods as hcp-Co@G400. These two catalysts only contain fcc-Co crystalline phase, as confirmed by TEM (Figs. S7–S8) and XRD (Fig. S9) measurements. Both of them exhibited very poor performance for LA hydrogenation, and their yields of 1,4-PDO were only 0.4% and 3.6%, respectively. These evaluation results unambiguously confirm the superior activity of hcp-Co to fcc-Co. Additionally, other base metal catalysts, such as Cu, Ni and Fe, also showed very poor yields of 1,4-PDO. To better reflect the reduction ability of carboxylic group for these catalysts, the model reaction of acetic acid hydrogenation was performed to estimate their intrinsic turnover frequency (TOF, Fig. 4b and Table S2). All the catalysts obtained high ethanol selectivity (greater than 93%) along with small amounts of by-product ethane. The activity trend was similar to their performance in LA hydrogenation. The TOF value of hcp-Co@G400 reached 10.7 h−1, higher than those catalysts annealed at other temperatures. The remaining Co3[Co(CN)6]2 species in hcp-Co@G300 cannot contribute to TOF, and decreased its value to 5.2 h−1. For the catalysts annealed at temperature higher than 400 °C, the increased graphene layer numbers greatly inhibited the adsorption of acetic acid (Fig. S10), leading to low reaction performance. As confirmed by DRIFTS of acetic acid adsorption in Fig. S10, the peak area of acetic acid adsorption (at 1726, 1468 and 1291 cm−1) of hcp-Co@G400 was much higher than other samples. Both 20fcc-Co@G400 and 60fcc-Co@G400 gave very limited TOF in acetic acid hydrogenation, only 0.3 h−1 and 0.4 h−1, respectively. Their TOF values were even one magnitude lower than that of hcp-Co@G countparts. The particle size effects on the TOF can be excluded since both Co particles are centered at 10 ~ 13 nm for 60fcc-Co@G400 and hcp-Co@G500, 600 and 700 catalysts with similar Co content. Thus, the huge difference in reactivity is strongly related to Co crystalline phase. The time course of LA hydrogenation over hcp-Co@G400 is displayed in Fig. S11. LA conversion sharply increased to 100% in 4 h. With increasing reaction time to 24 h, the yield of 1,4-PDO gradually improved at the expense of GVL. The reaction trend confirms that LA preferentially undergoes the hydrogenation of carbonyl group in comparison to carboxylic group. 1,4-PDO yield reached the maximal value of 89.5% at 24 h. The reaction stability is a very important criterion to evaluate strong acidic carboxylic acid hydrogenation, particularly for non-precious metal catalysts. As displayed in Fig. 5 a, no any decrease in LA conversion and 1,4-PDO yield was observed over hcp-Co@G400 in the reusability tests. The graphene encapsulated hcp-Co nanostructures were still well preserved after six reaction cycle tests, as confirmed by TEM images (Fig. S12). Moreover, ICP-AES test verified that only 1.1% Co content was leached, suggesting that the graphene shell can protect Co from leaching and corrosion caused by LA. In a control experiment, the supported 60fcc-Co@G400 (Fig. 5b) without graphene overcoat exhibited irreversible deactivation due to substantial Co leaching (18.7%). Considering the excellent performance in LA and acetic acid hydrogenation over hcp-Co@G400, we investigated its substrate scope for other typical carboxylic acid, particularly for biomass-derived acids (Table 2 ). More than 90% yields of alcohols were obtained in the conversion of short-chain monoaliphatic acids and challenging long-chain acids, such as palmitic and stearic acid. Diols are of special interest because of their vital role in manufacturing polyesters [5,10], particularly using the biomass-related carboxylic acids as feeds. We were pleased to find that these typical bio-based carboxylic acids, including LA, lactic, succinic, adipic, itaconic acids, were smoothly converted into desired diols with good to excellent yields. Moreover, many aromatic acids, such as furoic, benzoic and functionalized benzoic acids, can also been reduced efficiently in 75.6–94.6% yields. Notably, the aromatic rings, NO2, and aromatic ether were initially reduced, suggesting that the reduction of carboxylic group is very challenging relative to other reductive groups. However, there are still some limitations for this catalytic system. The selective hydrogenation of carboxylic moieties over other functional groups is very important for the synthesis of some special chemicals [9,42]. The aromatic CC bonds in furan or benzene rings are preferentially reduced over hcp-Co@G400, which results in total disappearance of aromaticity in the target alcohol."
9,Reaction mechanism for carboxylic acid hydrogenation,"3.3 Reaction mechanism for carboxylic acid hydrogenation So far, the reaction mechanism of carboxylic acid (RCOOH) hydrogenation still remains great debate on the initial dehydrogenation to form RCOO* and then deoxygenation to RCO* or direct dehydroxylation to generate RCO* [13,43,44]. Another key question is whether aldehyde (RCHO) is involved by RCO* hydrogenation [45,46]. To explore possible reaction mechanism, we initially performed the reaction kinetics of acetic acid hydrogenation over hcp-Co@G400 catalyst. As illustrated in Fig. 6 a, the reaction order with respect to H2 pressure was calculated to be 0.58, indicating that the reaction rate was moderately affected by H2 pressure. As the dissociation of H2 is very fast on Co surface, the further reaction of dissociated H* may require high reaction energy barrier. The reaction order with respect to acetic acid concentration (Fig. 6b) was estimated to be 0.08, suggesting that acetic acid is strongly adsorbed on hcp-Co surface, in well line with DFT calculation results (see below). To deeply understand the huge difference in reactivity of hcp-Co and fcc-Co, the surface reaction process was monitored by in situ DRIFTS of acetic acid hydrogenation. Notably, acetic acid cannot chemically adsorbed on support alone (Fig. S10). As displayed in Fig. 7 a, three typical peaks cantered at 1726, 1468 and 1291 cm−1 are assigned to CO stretching, CH3 bending, CO stretching vibrations of adsorbed acetic acid over hcp-Co@G400 [47,48], respectively. After introduction of flowing H2 at 220 °C, the peak intensity of acetic acid gradually decreased with increasing reaction time. Meanwhile, a new peak corresponding to CO stretching vibration of acetyl group appeared at 1630 cm−1 after 10 min and steadily grew up to 15 min [47]. The varying trends of these peaks indicate that CH3COOH undergoes dehydroxylation to form CH3CO* over hcp-Co sites. With further increasing time to 20 min, the peak of acetyl gradually disappeared accompanying with the presence of ethanol vibration peaks at 1390 (CH3) and 1066 cm−1 (CO) [45,49]. These evidences confirm that acetic acid hydrogenation to ethanol is proceeded through the acetyl pathway on hcp-Co surface. Although a similar phenomenon was observed for acetic acid hydrogenation over 60fcc-Co@G400 (Fig. 7b), its activity was much lower than that of hcp-Co@G400. No surface reaction occurred at 220 °C and it began to react at 250 °C. The very poor reactivity of 60fcc-Co@G400 is consistent with the evaluation results. We carried out DFT calculations to investigate the reaction mechanism on hcp-Co and fcc-Co catalysts. The hcp-Co (002) and fcc-Co (111) surfaces were modelled (Fig. S13) based on the most exposed crystalline facets, as evidenced by XRD and TEM results. The optimized structures and adsorption energies for all the possible species were first calculated and the results are summarized at Fig. 8 , Table S3 and Table S4. CH3COOH preferably adsorbs at Co top site through carbonyl oxygen, in which the CC bond is vertical to hcp-Co surface. Its adsorption energy is −0.63 eV and CoO bond length is 2.081 Å, suggesting its strong chemisorption on hcp-Co surface. Contrarily, the preferred adsorption of CH3COOH on fcc-Co is very weak with an absorption energy of 0.08 eV and long CoO bond (2.208 Å), in which the CC bond is parallel to fcc-Co surface. H2, ethanol and all the possible intermediate species exhibit similar or minor differences in adsorption configurations and energies on hcp-Co and fcc-Co. H2 preferentially adsorbs on top sites in hcp-Co, and easily dissociates to H* on 3-fold hollow sites. The H2 dissociation (Fig. S14) has nearly no reaction barrier and is thermodynamically favourable process. Moreover, the diffusion of H* from a hollow site to a nearby hollow site has a very low activation barrier of 0.15 eV, suggesting its high mobility. Similar behaviour is observed on fcc-Co, confirming that metal Co possesses excellent H2 activation ability, irrespective of crystallite phase. Based on all the possible elementary reactions, the full potential energy surface of acetic acid hydrogenation over hcp-Co are displayed in Fig. 9 a and their transition state (TS) configurations are listed in Table S5. CH3CO* is the first generated intermediate, no matter the reaction occurs via the direct dehydroxylation pathway or the dehydrogenation-deoxygenation pathway. Compared to direct dehydroxylation pathway, the activation energy of initial CH3COOH* dehydrogenation reaction is lower, while its consecutive deoxygenation is fairly unfavourable owing to the remarkably high activation barrier up to 1.27 eV. Therefore, the CH3CO* is most probably formed from CH3COOH* dehydroxylation with a moderate activation energy of 0.86 eV. The generated CH3CO* species can proceed to hydrogenation of carbonyl group either by initial CH bond formation to CH3CHO* or OH bond formation to CH3COH*. With lower activity energy of 0.33 eV, CH bond formation is preferred over OH bond formation (0.33 eV vs. 0.49 eV), in line with previous calculation results of the hydrogenation of ketones [50,51]. Subsequently, CH3CHO* undergoes further hydrogenation either by CH bond formation or OH bond formation. The formation of CH3CH2O* is kinetically and thermodynamically favourable (Ea = 0.08 eV and Er = −0.67 eV). However, the hydrogenation of CH3CH2O* to CH3CH2OH* needs significantly high activation barrier of 1.09 eV, suggesting that this reaction pathway is probably not favourable. The formation of CH3CHOH* from CH3CHO* hydrogenation by CH bond also needs high activation energy of 0.89 eV. Moreover, CH3CHO species were not detected by DRIFTS spectroscopy, suggesting that CH3CHO pathway is not favoured at all. Then, we reconsider that the hydrogenation of CH3CO* to CH3COH* only has a little higher activation energy (0.49 eV) than that of CH3CHO* formation (0.33 eV). Further generation of CH3CHOH* by CH3COH* hydrogenation is remarkably preferred to CH3CHO* hydrogenation (0.50 eV vs. 0.89 eV). Moreover, consecutive hydrogenation of CH3CHOH* to final product CH3CH2OH* occurs with nearly no activation barrier (0.05 eV), because this is a thermodynamically favourable elementary reaction (−0.29 eV). Thus, it can be deduced that CH3COOH hydrogenation to ethanol follows the pathway of CH3COOH* → CH3CO* → CH3COH* → CH3CHOH* → CH3CH2OH*, as supported by the in situ DRIFTS spectra results that the CH3CHO species were not detected. The produced ethanol can easily desorb from hcp-Co (002) surface with 0.29 eV. Notably, the remaining OH* from CH3COOH* dehydroxylation will react with nearby H* to produce H2O with rather high activation barrier (1.07 eV), suggesting that this is the determining-rate step for CH3COOH hydrogenation over hcp-Co. Although acetic acid hydrogenation follows the same reaction pathway in both hcp-Co and fcc-Co (Fig. 9b), large differences in the reaction and activation energies are clearly observed. The determining-rate step over fcc-Co becomes the formation of CH3CO* from CH3COOH* dehydroxylation with a significantly higher activation barrier of 1.23 eV, which leads to poor reaction activity of fcc-Co. The weak parallel adsorption of CH3COOH on fcc-Co needs to undergo configuration transformation to vertical motif in the formation of TS1, resulting in higher activation barrier in dehydroxylation reaction. Conversely, the vertical adsorption of CH3COOH on hcp-Co facilitates the formation of TS1 by elongating CO bond from 1.36 Å to 2.08 Å, which greatly declines the activation barrier to 0.86 eV. Another elementary reaction of CH3CHOH + H → CH3CH2OH also have moderate difference in activation barrier. For CH3CHOH* configuration, the CC tilt angle relative to hcp-Co surface is more similar to that of CH3CH2OH* and only a small distortion in the formation of TS4 geometry, thus leading to lower activation energy in comparison to fcc-Co."
10,Conclusions,"In this work, we have successfully synthesized pure hcp-Co NPs encapsulated in few-layer graphene via the reduction of Co2C intermediate from MOF precursor. The graphene shell enables metastable hcp-Co NPs to be strongly confined in the inner space, which can resist not only their allotropic transformation upon high temperature treatment but also their leaching against strong carboxylic acids. Compared to conventional 60fcc-Co@G400, hcp-Co@G400 exhibited one magnitude enhancement in reaction activity of carboxylic acid hydrogenation to alcohol. Moreover, the graphene encapsulated hcp-Co@G400 showed extensive substrate tolerance and excellent reusability. In situ DRIFTS and DFT calculation in model acetic acid hydrogenation reaction reveal that carboxylic acid hydrogenation initially undergoes dehydroxylation to RCO* followed by its consecutive hydrogenation to RCH2OH. The enhanced reaction reactivity of hcp-Co over fcc-Co is mainly due to the decreasing activation energy from 1.23 eV to 0.86 eV in acetic acid dehydroxylation, which is associated with their distinct CH3COOH adsorption configurations."
