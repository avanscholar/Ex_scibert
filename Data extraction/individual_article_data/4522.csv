0,Introduction,"Molecular interaction studies play an important role in understanding the structure and properties of liquids and liquid mixtures. Hydrogen bonding plays an important role in governing the structure and the dynamics of chemical and biological systems [1]. Hydrogen bonding is complex in the liquid state because of the uncertainty in identifying the particular bonds and the number of molecules involved. The local structures of hydrogen bonded liquids are complicated due to molecular clusters and network structures. Dielectric and thermodynamic investigations of solutions containing varying amounts of interacting molecules help to detect the formation and composition of hydrogen bonded complexes, since the presence of hydrogen bond brings a considerable change in the dielectric and thermodynamic properties of liquid mixtures [2]. In particular, the excess dielectric and thermodynamic properties of mixtures are more useful in the study of molecular interactions and arrangements [3]. The component liquids taken for the present investigation are amine and alcohols. Aromatic amines, which are non-associative, are very important in the production of dyes, pesticides and antioxidants [4]. Alcohols are industrially and scientifically important organic compounds and their physical and chemical properties are largely determined by the –OH group. Alcohols are strongly associated in solution because of dipole–dipole interaction and hydrogen bonding. The nature of interaction between –NH (amine) and –OH (alcohol) groups plays an important role in biological systems and drug synthesis [5]. The dielectric relaxation and spectroscopic studies on the binary mixture systems of propan-1-ol with benzoates and propan-2-ol with aniline have been carried out to understand the nature of molecular interactions [6,7]. The present work aims at studying the dielectric and thermodynamic behavior of pure and binary mixtures of N-methyl aniline with propan-1-ol (system 1) and N-methyl aniline with propan-2-ol (system 2) in different frequency ranges for various mole fractions at different temperatures. From the experimental data, the dielectric parameters – dipole moment, excess dipole moment, excess Helmholtz energy, excess permittivity, excess inverse relaxation time and excess thermo dynamical values are calculated for the pure and binary mixtures [8–11]. The theoretical vibration frequencies and dipole moments of the pure and equimolar hydrogen bonded systems are obtained from the Hamiltonian quantum mechanical calculations [12,13] i.e., ab initio Hartree–Fock (HF) and Density Functional Theory (DFT – B3LYP) methods with 6-31+G∗ and 6-311+G∗∗ basis sets using Spartan 08 modelling software [14]. Conformational analysis of the formation of hydrogen bond in the equimolar binary mixture systems of N-methyl aniline with propan-1-ol/propan-2-ol is supported by the experimental FT-IR spectra. The derived theoretical values are compared with the experimental values."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The compounds N-methyl aniline (NMA), propan-1-ol (1PN), propan-2-ol (2PN), and benzene of AR grade are procured from Merck, Germany. All the liquids used were further purified by standard procedure [15]. The specifications of the purity of samples and the comparison of the experimental and literature values [16,17] of some basic parameters are given in tables 1a and 1b ."
3,Procedure,"2.2 Procedure The binary mixtures are prepared for different mole fractions i.e., mole fraction (x 2) of alcohols (1PN/2PN) is varied from 0 to 1 for both system 1 and system 2 (with a step increment of 0.1). The permittivity values at spot frequencies 1kHz (ε static), 10kHz, 100kHz, 1MHz, and 10MHz for the above systems are measured using a HP-LF impedance analyzer (Model No: 4192 A) at temperatures, T =(303.15, 308.15, 313.15, 318.15, and 323.15)K. The real (ε′) and imaginary (ε″) parts of the complex dielectric permittivity ( ε ∗ = ε ′ - ε ″ ) are determined with Microwave bench (X-Band, 8.60GHz) using the Plunger method [18] at different temperatures. The high frequency dielectric permittivity (ε ∞ = n 2) is obtained from the refractometer measurements using M/s ASCO make Abbe’s refractometer with sodium D light as source at different temperatures. The temperature controller system with a water bath, supplied by M/s Sakti Scientific Instruments Company-India, has been used to maintain the constant temperature with an uncertainty ±0.1K. The mass measurements are performed on a digital electronic balance (Mettler Toledo AB 135, Switzerland) with an uncertainty of ±0.00001g. The densities of the pure liquids are measured at the corresponding temperatures by using a 10cm3 specific gravity bottle. The average uncertainties in the measurement of ε static, ε ∞, ε′, ε ″ and density are ±0.002, ±0.0002, ±0.01, ±0.03, and ±0.0001g·cm−3 respectively [8]. The average uncertainties in the measurement of dipole moment, Helmholtz energy and relaxation time are ±0.02D, ±0.001J·mol−1 and ±0.02ps respectively [8,10]. The FT-IR-spectra of pure and equimolar binary mixture systems are recorded in the 400 to 4000cm−1 region on Perkin–Elmer (spectrum bX) series."
4,Theory,"Higasi’s method [9] is used to measure the dipole moments for the pure and equimolar systems (system 1 and system 2), by diluting them in non-polar solvent benzene. (1) μ 2 = 27 kTM 2 ( a 0 - a ∞ ) 4 π Nd 1 ( ε 1 + 2 ) 2 , where M 2 is molar mass of solute, a 0 and a ∞ are respectively the slopes of ε static and ε ∞ with respect to the weight fraction of the solute, d 1 is density of solvent, ε 1 is the static dielectric permittivity of solvent (benzene). The excess dipole moments (Δμ) [8] of the systems are determined by equation (2) (2) Δ μ = μ 12 - μ 1 - μ 2 , where μ 1 is the dipole moment of NMA, μ 2 is the dipole moment of either 1PN or 2PN and μ 12 is the dipole moment of the equimolar solute mixtures (NMA+1PN) or (NMA+2PN). The excess Helmholtz energy (ΔA E) is a dielectric parameter to evaluate the interaction between the components in the mixture through breaking mechanism of hydrogen bond [19] and is expressed as (3) Δ A E = Δ A E or + Δ A E rr + Δ A E 12 , where Δ A E or represents the excess dipolar energy due to long range electrostatic interaction, Δ A E rr represents the excess dipolar energy due to the short range interaction between identical molecules, Δ A E 12 represents the excess free energy due to short-range interaction between dissimilar molecules. The above terms are given in detail in equation (4) (4) Δ A E = - N A 2 ∑ r = 1 , 2 x r 2 μ r 2 R fr - R fr 0 + ∑ r = 1 , 2 x r 2 μ r 2 g rr - 1 R fr - R fr 0 + x 1 x 2 μ 1 μ 2 R f 1 + R f 2 - R f 1 0 - R f 2 0 , where, R fr 0 = ( 8 π N A 9 V r ) ( ε r - 1 ) ( ε ∞ r + 2 ) ( 2 ε r + ε ∞ r ) , R fr = ( 8 π N A 9 V r ) ( ε m - 1 ) ( ε ∞ r + 2 ) ( 2 ε m + ε ∞ r ) , g 12 = g f and V r is the molar volume of the components. εr , ε ∞r are the dielectric permittivity values at static and optic frequencies of the pure liquids respectively. The contribution of hydrogen bonds to the dielectric properties of the mixtures can be studied in terms of excess permittivity (ε E). The excess permittivity (ε E), which provides qualitative information about the formation of multimers in the mixture [20], can be computed as (5) ε E = ( ε m - ε ∞ m ) - [ ( ε 1 - ε ∞ m ) x 1 + ( ε 2 - ε ∞ m ) x 2 ] , where x is mole fraction and suffixes 1, 2 and m represent liquid 1, liquid 2 and mixture respectively. The qualitative information provided by excess permittivity about the mixtures is as follows: ε E =0 indicates that there is no interaction between the components in the mixture. ε E <0 indicates that the components in the mixture interact in such a way that the effective dipolar polarization gets reduced and the components may form multimers leading to less effective dipoles. ε E >0 indicates that the components in the mixture interact in such a way that the effective dipolar polarization gets increased and the components may form multimers leading to more effective dipoles. The dielectric data obtained i.e., ε static ε ∗ = ε ′ - j ε ″ ε ∞ , and the data from LF-impedance analyzer are used to fit in an Argand diagram to calculate the relaxation time (τ). The distribution of relaxation time is witnessed from Cole–Cole arc plot [21] using the relation: (6) ω τ = ν u 1 1 - α , where α (distribution parameter), u and ν values are determined from their respective Cole–Cole plots. The excess inverse relaxation time ( 1 / τ ) E , which gives information regarding the dynamics of solute- solvent interaction and represents the average broadening of dielectric spectra [22], can be defined as (7) 1 τ E = 1 τ m - 1 τ 1 x 1 + 1 τ 2 x 2 . The thermodynamic parameters excess Gibbs free energy of activation (ΔG ∗)E, excess molar enthalpy of activation (ΔH ∗)E and excess molar entropy of activation (ΔS ∗)E at different mole fractions can be determined by fitting the Eyring rate equation [23,24] as (8) τ = h kT exp Δ G ∗ RT = h kT exp Δ H ∗ - T Δ S ∗ RT , where h is the Planck’s constant, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin and R is the gas constant. To determine the theoretical values of vibration frequencies and dipole moments, the minimum energy structures of the monomers of N-methyl aniline, propan-1-ol, propan-2-ol and the equimolar hydrogen bonded complexes are obtained from ab initio Hartree–Fock (HF) and Density Functional Theory (DFT – B3LYP) methods with 6-31+G∗ and 6-311+G∗∗ basis sets using Spartan 08 modelling software."
5,Results and discussion,"The permittivity values ε static and ε ∞ for various mole fractions at different temperatures of the binary systems (NMA+1PN) (system 1) and (NMA+2PN) (system 2) are determined experimentally and their variations with mole fraction are shown in figures 1 and 2 (system 1) and figures 3 and 4 (system 2). From the figures it is observed that there is non-linear variation of εstatic and ε ∞ with mole fraction at all temperatures, which indicates interaction between the compounds. Similar results were reported by Kroeger [25] for the mixture of alcohols and polar liquids. The dipole moment (μ) values for pure and equimolar systems (system 1 and system 2) at room temperature are determined experimentally with Higasi’s method and theoretically with Hamiltonian quantum mechanical calculations (ab initio and DFT) and the corresponding values are given in table 2 . The dipole moments for these systems are measured experimentally by diluting them in non-polar solvent benzene. It is observed that, there is an increase in the dipole moment of equimolar mixture when compared to the individual compounds. This may be due to the formation of hydrogen bonding in the mixture systems [26]. The theoretical dipole moment values are in good agreement with the experimental values. The small deviation between the experimental and theoretical values may be due to the π electron cloud of non-polar solvent benzene affecting the dipole moment value of the solute systems in experimental case [27]. It is also observed that, the variation in temperature significantly affects the dipole moment values of the pure compounds and the equimolar systems (table 3 ). The excess dipole moment (Δμ) values obtained theoretically and experimentally (at different temperatures) are given in tables 2 and 3. The negative Δμ values indicate the absence of ionic structure in the binary system because, the presence of ionic bonding in the system triggers high positive value of Δμ [28]. The excess dipole moment value is a qualitative index for the presence of hydrogen bonding in system 1 and system 2. The long range and short-range interactions between dipoles can be studied from the thermodynamic parameter excess Helmholtz energy (ΔA E) and its constituent parameters Δ A E or , Δ A E rr and Δ A E 12 [29]. The value of Δ A E or represents the long range interaction between he dipoles in the mixture. In system 1 and system 2, the positive values of Δ A E or indicate the existence of attractive force between the dipoles and negative values of Δ A E or indicate the repulsive force between dipoles. In both the systems, the values of Δ A E or are positive up to equimolar concentration and negative for remaining concentrations. It is interesting to note that, the values of Δ A E or (table 4 ) decrease with increase in temperature for all the mole fractions in both the systems. Hence, the strength of dipole–dipole interaction depends on the concentration and temperature. The values of Δ A E m for system 1 are greater than system 2, which may be due to the structural changes. The values of Δ A E rr predict the information on the short range interaction between similar molecules. In both the systems, the values of Δ A E rr (table 5 ) are highly positive at all mole fractions indicating the existence of short range interaction through hydrogen bonding. The values of Δ A E rr for system 1 are greater than system 2 predicting the strong short range interaction between the components of similar molecules. The values of Δ A E 12 indicate the information on the strength of interaction between unlike molecules. In both the systems, the values of Δ A E 12 (table 6 ) change appreciably with changing concentration and temperature. This reveals that hetero association exists between the compounds and it varies with concentration and temperatures. The high positive values of ΔA E (table 7 ) indicate the formation of β-clusters with anti-parallel alignment in both the mixture systems. Because, the formation of these β-clusters decreases the effective dipole moment of the system when compared to the sum of dipole moments of individual compounds and thereby it decreases the internal energy [30]. The decrement in the internal energy of a molecule leads to the increment in the excess Helmholtz energy value. From the high positive values of ΔA E (table 7), it is evident that β-clusters are formed in both the systems, at all temperatures, up to 0.7 mole fraction of NMA in the mixture. The higher positive values of A E, in the case of system 1 compared to that of system 2, indicate that the formation of β-clusters is high in system 1. Further, the negative values of ΔA E indicate the formation of α-clusters. Because, the formation of these α-clusters increases the effective dipole moment which in turn increases the internal energy. For 0.8 and 0.9 mole fractions of NMA in system 1 and system 2, negative values of ΔA E (table 7) are observed, at all temperatures, which predict the formation of α-clusters. Excess permittivity (ε E) is a dielectric parameter, which gives information about the interaction between the components of the mixture. Mehrotra et al. [31] had pointed out that the change in the value of ε E with concentration is due to the interaction between dissimilar molecules which may produce structural changes. In the present study, negative values of εE are obtained for all concentrations at different temperatures for system 1 and system 2 as shown in figures 5 and 6 respectively. These negative values indicate that the molecules in the mixture form multimers through hydrogen bonding in such a way that the effective dipole moment gets reduced [32]. The more negative deviations in ε E values of system 1 compared to system 2 indicate a strong hydrogen bond in system 1 than in system 2. The values of relaxation times (τ), for various mole fractions, of systems 1 and 2 are given in table 8 . It is observed that the relaxation times of pure alcohols (1PN and 2PN) are higher. This is due to the formation of intra molecular hydrogen bonding between one alcohol molecule and another (R–O–H⋯OH–R) and leads to the formation of self associated groups. The increment in the number of self associated groups causes the alcohol molecules to absorb more electromagnetic energy. Due to this molecules relax very slowly leading to higher relaxation times. Further, it is observed that the relaxation times of pure 1PN are greater than that of pure 2PN due to larger effective radius of the rotating unit [33]. But, the relaxation times of pure NMA are very low compared to pure 1PN or 2PN due to the non existence of self associated groups [26]. It is observed that the relaxation times decrease as the concentration of NMA increases, in both the systems, indicating the bond formation between –NH group of amine and –OH group of alcohols. The calculated values of excess inverse relaxation time ( 1 / τ ) E , for both the systems, are negative and are presented in figures 7 and 8 for the systems 1 and 2 respectively. These negative values of ( 1 / τ ) E , indicate the slower rotation of dipoles due to the formation of hydrogen bonded structures producing a field which hinders the effective dipole rotation [11,22]. In addition, it is observed that the negative deviations are more in system 1 than in system 2 which shows greater strength of intermolecular hetero interaction in system 1. The variation of excess Gibbs free energy of activation (ΔG ∗)E values with mole fraction and temperature for system 1 and system 2 are shown in figures 9 and 10 respectively. The values of (ΔG ∗)E are positive, in both the systems, indicating the presence of interaction between the molecules of the mixtures. The magnitude of (ΔG ∗)E is an excellent indicator of the strength of interaction between unlike molecules in liquid mixtures [34]. It is observed that (ΔG ∗)E values of system 1 are greater than that of system 2 indicating a stronger bond formation in system 1. The excess molar enthalpy (ΔH ∗)E and excess molar entropy (ΔS ∗)E values are shown in figures 11 and 12 respectively. The negative values of (ΔH ∗)E, for both the systems, show that strong attractive interactions are present between unlike molecules of the mixtures [35]. The formation of hydrogen bonding between the components in system 1 and system 2 is also justified by the negative values of excess molar entropy [11]. Observing the experimental FT-IR spectra for the equimolar binary mixture of system 1 (NMA+1PN), there is a shift of 125cm−1 wave number in the position of –NH and 108cm−1 wave number in the position of –OH for the mixture compared with their respective pure spectrums. Similarly, the FT-IR spectra for the equimolar binary mixture of system 2 (NMA+2PN), there is a shift of 44cm−1 wave number in the position of –NH and 132cm−1 wave number in the position of –OH for the mixture compared with their respective pure spectrums. These shifts are caused by the strong interaction between the high electro-negative charge of oxygen in NMA and hydrogen of the alcohol. Thus, the IR analysis convinces intermolecular hydrogen bonding of the equimolar binary mixtures in system 1 and system 2 effectively with proportionate variations in stretching frequencies of –NH and –OH compared to their respective pure systems [36]. The comparison of experimental and the scaled down theoretical FT-IR values [37] is provided in table 9 and the obtained theoretical values are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values [38]. The optimized geometrical structures representing the formation of hydrogen bonding, obtained from Density Functional Theory (DFT – B3LYP) method with 6-311+G∗∗ basis set calculation using Spartan 08 modelling software for system 1 and system 2 are shown in figures 13 (a) and (b) respectively. In the present investigation, along with different dielectric and thermodynamic parameters, their correlations have been thoroughly examined and are presented below. The high static permittivity values of pure alcohols (1PN/2PN) (figures 1 and 3), at all temperatures, indicate the parallel alignment of dipoles along the field direction and also the associative nature of the molecules leading to high values of relaxation time. The low static permittivity values of pure NMA, at all temperatures, indicate the anti parallel alignment of dipoles along the field direction and also the non-associative nature of the molecules leading to low relaxation time values [39]. In the present study, it is clearly observed that the values of relaxation times are high for pure alcohols (1PN/2PN) and low for pure NMA (table 8) at all temperatures. Furthermore, it is observed that the static permittivity values of mixture systems decrease as the mole fraction of NMA increase. This phenomenon indicates that the alignment of dipoles along the field is changing from parallel orientation to anti parallel orientation. The process of anti parallel alignment of dipoles, in the mixture systems, results in the formation of β-clusters [40]. These β-clusters in turn give rise to high positive ΔA E values. Accordingly, high positive values of ΔA E (table 7) are witnessed in the present work. Further, the formation of β-clusters decreases the effective dipole moment of the mixture compared to the sum of individual systems. Due to this, the excess dipole moment (Δμ) values must be negative. It has been observed, experimentally and theoretically, that the values of Δμ are negative for equimolar mixture systems (table 2). The same phenomenon has been observed experimentally at all temperatures (table 3). These negative values of Δμ suggest that the effective dipole moment gets reduced and simultaneously negative excess permittivity (ε E) values must be obtained. Because, the negative values of ε E indicate the formation of multimers through hydrogen bonding with reduced effective dipole moment. figures 5 and 6 clearly show the negative values of ε E in coherence with the above phenomenon. The increment in the relaxation time value, as the mole fraction of alcohols (1PN/2PN) increases in the mixture systems, leads to slower rotation of the dipoles. This trend results in negative excess inverse relaxation time ( ( 1 / τ ) E ) (figures 7 and 8). The positive values of excess activation free energy ((ΔG ∗)E) are due to the formation of β-clusters, because β-clusters are characterized by reduced internal energy making excess activation free energy positive (figures 9 and 10). With increase in the temperature the thermal agitation increases and the dipoles require more energy in order to attain the equilibrium with the applied field which results in negative excess molar entropy ((ΔS ∗)E) values (figure 12). This indicates that the activated state is more ordered than the normal state, which is true because, in the activated state the dipoles try to align with the applied field. Thus the parameters determined, in the present work, correlate with one another and at the same time each parameter supports the formation of hydrogen bonding in the mixture systems. Further, it is observed that the strength of bond formation between the compounds in system 1 is more than that of system 2, because of the high orderliness of dipoles and larger effective radius of the rotating unit of pure 1PN compared to that of pure 2PN."
6,Conclusions,"The dielectric and thermodynamic parameters, viz. dipole moment, excess dipole moment, excess Helmholtz energy, excess permittivity, excess inverse relaxation and excess thermo dynamical values are computed for the pure and binary mixtures of the systems N-methyl aniline with propan-1-ol (system 1) and N-methyl aniline with propan-2-ol (system 2) for various mole fractions at different temperatures. The formation of hydrogen bonding between the mixture systems is identified by studying the variations in the parameters determined. The existence of the hydrogen bond between the –NH group of N-methyl aniline with –OH group of alcohol (propan-1-ol/propan-2-ol) is confirmed through FT-IR spectra. The theoretical values of dipole moment, excess dipole moment and FT-IR values are determined using ab initio Hartree–Fock (HF) and Density Functional Theory (DFT - B3LYP) methods with 6-31+G∗ and 6-311+G∗∗ basis sets and compared with the experimental values. Further, the correlations among the determined parameters are discussed in detail in order to understand the underlying physical chemistry in the investigation."
