0,Introduction,"Benzaldehyde derivatives as the aromatic aldehydes have an extensive range of applications in the pharmaceutical and food industries [1]. However, both homogenous and heterogeneous catalysts were applied to complete the conversion of alcohols to aldehydes, they suffer from some obstacles like hard conditions such as high temperature and pressure and using toxic oxidants [2]. Photocatalysis is one of the most reliable methods to resolve principle and earthly crises like environment and energy consumption by irradiation of various light sources like UV lamps, mercury lamps, visible light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and sunlight [3,4]. The aromatic alcohol's controlled oxidation to their corresponding aldehydes by the photocatalytic oxidation process is a vital reaction for both organic synthesis and industrial production [5]. Systems based on the transformations utilizing visible-light sources like LED lamps have gained increasing significance for this issue due to not producing hazardous and unsafe wastes and using clean energy resources [6]. In this procedure, the originated electrons and holes from the semiconductor are transferred into the surface to drive the photocatalytic reaction. So far, numerous semiconductor photocatalysts have been applied to carry out photo-oxidation of benzyl alcohols. Among various photocatalysts with maximum productivity reported for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol, G-C3N4 the most stable carbon nitride allotrope, and 2d conjugated polymer is a rising star in the visible-light-active photocatalyst arena [7]. This cheap, non-toxic, and easily prepared photocatalyst has become a hot investigation field due to its physical and chemical structure as an n-type semiconductor which shows an impressive capacity to transfer electrons under visible light irradiation [8,9]. The photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 was first revealed by Wang and coworkers for H2 generation [10]. It has been considerably studied in various photocatalytic reaction systems, including H2 production, water photo-splitting and CO2 reduction reaction, synthesis of organic compounds, and photodegradation of organic pollutants, due to its favorable stability and proper band gap (2.7 eV) [11–14]. Recently g–C3N4–based semiconductors have been also catalyzed some oxidation reactions like the oxidation of alcohols and alkanes [15,16]. In spite of that, high charge-hole recombination, lack of electrical conductivity, and the poor specific surface area still restrict its photocatalytic efficiency and limiting its application considerably. Hence, different strategies, have been proposed to modify g-C3N4 and overcome the above drawbacks aiming at further improvement of its photocatalytic productivity [17–24]. So, as part of our interest in modifying g-C3N4, and designing new catalysts [25–28], here we report synthesizing a series of g-C3N4 based photocatalysts (bulk g-C3N4, g-C3N4 nanosheets, porous g-C3N4, N-doped porous g-C3N4, S-doped porous g-C3N4, P-doped porous g-C3N4, P-doped porous g-C3N4/Ag, P-doped porous g-C3N4/Cu, and P-doped porous g-C3N4/Pd). Among them, P-doped porous g-C3N4/Pd was chosen as a new, recoverable, and affordable heterogeneous photocatalyst. The novelty of the present research and the potential utilization of the synthesized materials as heterogeneous photocatalysts have been investigated by studying the photo-oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol under visible-light irradiation (by employing 43W Blue LEDs as the low-priced and economical source of light) under atmospheric pressure. Photocatalytic experiments suggest that the synthesized photocatalyst displayed an enhancement of photoactivity with respect to the pure g-C3N4. By using two excellent techniques, heteroatom doping and decorating transition metal nanoparticles, our designed photocatalyst demonstrates much better efficiency because of the wide absorption range of visible light and modulating energy gap. It can be assumed that g-C3N4 can be a perfect N source to coordinate with metal ions, to form active sites for chemical reactions such as photocatalysis, which leads to quick electron transfer. As-prepared photocatalysts were characterized by various techniques such as FT-IR (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy), XRD (X-ray powder diffraction), FE-SEM (Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy), EDS (Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy), TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy), DRS (Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy), BET (Brunauer-Emmet-Teller method), XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) and PL (Photoluminescence spectroscopy)."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All chemicals including melamine (C3H6N6), thiourea (SC(NH2)2), urea (CH4N2O), Dimethylformamide ((CH3)2NC(O)H), Phosphoric acid (H3PO4), palladium chloride (PdCl2), silver nitrate (AgNO3), Copper chloride (CuCl2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and acetonitrile (CH3CN) were purchased from Merck and Sigma-Aldrich companies. They all used as obtained with a purity of >99%."
3,Methods,"2.2 Methods 2.2.1 Preparation of bulk g-C3N4 As reported previously [29], the g-C3N4 photocatalyst was prepared by directly heating melamine. 8 g of melamine powder was taken into an alumina crucible with a cover and heated to 500°C for 2 h at a heating rate of 20°C/min. After that, the collected sample was cooled and ground. 2.2.2 Preparation of g-C3N4 nanosheets 8 g of urea was put into a covered crucible and calcined in a furnace for 4 h at 550 °C using a rate of 2.5 °C/min. The light yellow sample means g-C3N4 nanosheets (CN NSs) were collected after cooling to room temperature [30]. 2.2.3 Preparation of porous g-C3N4 The muffle furnace was heated to 550°C, and then a crucible with a lid containing 8 g of melamine was placed into it and remained for 4 h. Hereafter labeled as the HPCN (graphitic carbon nitride with high performance) was crushed into powder after it was naturally cooled [31]. 2.2.4 Preparation of P-doped porous g-C3N4 6 g melamine was saturated in H3PO4 (0.5 M) during the night. Afterward, the sample was dried in the oven at 80°C for 12 h and then calcined in the furnace under the same condition of HPCN. The obtained material was collected for the next step. 2.2.5 Preparation of P-doped porous g-C3N4/Pd To immobilize Pd NPs, 0.3 g of P-doped Porous g-C3N4 was dispersed in 8 mL EtOH for 30 min subsequently, a solution of PdCl2 in DI water (0.03 g in 2 mL) was added under the stirring condition for 12 h. Consequently, the mixture was stirred magnetically for another 3 h after adding a solution of 0.2 M NaBH4 (2 mL). Eventually, the product was centrifuged and washed with MeOH and H2O for several times and dried at 60°C for 12 h."
4,Photocatalytic conversion tests,"2.3 Photocatalytic conversion tests Evaluation of photoactivity of synthesized photocatalysts was investigated by photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol under blue LED illumination as a visible light source. A 10 mL Pyrex glass was utilized for this valuable experiment under visible light irradiation and water flowing jacket was applied to fix the temperature of all experiments which setpoint calibrated at 298 K. In order to accomplish the reaction, 4 × 3W blue light-emitting diode lamps were used. Hydrogen peroxide (1.5 mmol) was chosen as the best oxidant and was added to Benzyl alcohol (1 mmol) in the presence of acetonitrile (2 mL) as the best solvent. Moreover, 0.01 g of catalysts was needed to reach the best response under magnetically stirring condition. It should be noted that the dark condition was investigated as the blank test for each experiment to prove that the irradiation of light is vital for the conversion of reaction. Eventually, the reaction product was recognized by the 1H NMR spectra and gas chromatography (GC) technique. Spectral data of Benzaldehyde (Figs. S1–2): 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) (ppm): 7.43–8.13 (m, 5H), 10 (s, 1H)."
5,Material characterization,"2.4 Material characterization X-ray diffractometer patterns were carried out to determine the crystalline structure of the samples by using the Philips PW1730 instrument with Cu Kα X-ray source (λ = 1.54 Å). The SEM (transmission electron microscopy) micrographs were taken to characterize morphology (TESCAN MIRA3 microscope) after the deposition of a thin gold layer by sputtering. Elemental analysis of the samples (EDAX) was also performed. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted on a TEM Philips EM 208 S microscope (acceleration voltage of 100 kV). The chemical composition of the samples was analyzed with infrared spectra (FTIR) on Shimadzu 8400s spectrophotometer using KBr pellets as a diluent in the range of 400–4000 cm−1. DRS (diffuse reflectance spectra) were collected at room temperature by means of a Perkin-Elmer-Lambda 35 spectroscopy to evaluate the optical band gap. The specific surface areas (SSAs) of the degassed samples (150) were determined via N2 adsorption data and in accordance with the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) method (Belsorp mini II, Microtrac Bel Corp, Japan). PL (Photoluminescence spectra) were acquired on a G9800A Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (at room temperature). XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectra) was conducted on AXIS His spectrometer (Kratos Analytical) to study the chemical composition of the surface. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Advance Spectrometer (400 MHz) utilizing tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal reference. The progress of the reactions was followed by TLC (thin layer chromatography, silica gel 60 F254)."
6,Results and discussion,"A series of photocatalysts, including bulk g-C3N4, g-C3N4 nanosheets, porous g-C3N4, N-doped porous g-C3N4, S-doped porous g-C3N4, P-doped porous g-C3N4, P-doped porous g-C3N4/Ag, P-doped porous g-C3N4/Cu, and P-doped porous g-C3N4/Pd were designed and prepared according to previous literature with some modifications (see details in SI). In all of the methods of preparation of the photocatalyst, melamine and urea were used as precursors. All the samples were further treated at 550°C in the atmosphere and then resulted in polymerization to obtain the final products. They were characterized and evaluated to choose the most efficient photocatalyst. Experiments revealed that P-doped porous g-C3N4/Pd exhibits the most ameliorated photoactive performance."
7,Powders characterization,"3.1 Powders characterization As depicted in Fig. 1 , the molecular structure of the photocatalysts were investigated by FT-IR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) spectra. With respect to g-C3N4, the broadband ranging from 3000 to 3500 cm−1 is attributed to NH and OH bands, which are associated with the existence of the uncondensed amino functions and the surface adsorbed H2O species [32]. The strong stretching modes of C6H7 units, the major structure of the g-C3N4 (CN heterocycles) are located at about 1200–1600 cm−1 and 2000 cm−1 region [33]. The absorption band at 808 cm−1 is recognized as the typical mode of the triazine rings [34]. The vibrations of the P-pCN/Pd sample are less intensive. No remarkable difference was seen between the P-pCN and P-pCN/Pd samples spectra, suggesting that the heteroatom (phosphorous) doping, as well as metal (Pd) immobilizing, could not change the graphitic framework of the C–N, which is needed for -delocalized systems to produce and transfer charges. Moreover, the vibration or stretching modes were hardly observed corresponding to the phosphorous element due to the low amount of the P-related groups and the overlap effect by the C–N vibrations [35–37]. The FT-IR spectra of all synthesized samples are represented in Figs. S3–5. The crystalline structure of the metallic Pd over P-pCN surface was confirmed by XRD patterns (Fig. 2 ). So far, it is accepted that triazine building units are the base of g-C3N4. The diagnostic peak at 26.93° (002) is assigned to the interlayer stacking of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) (JCPDS card No. 87–1526). The peaks at 39.99° (111), 46.47° (200), and 68.03° (220) are representative of zero oxidation state of Pd NPs [38] (JCPDS card No. 05–0681). The peak location of the (002) plane is gradually shifted from 26.93° (P-pCN) to 27.5° (P-pCN/Pd), which is likely because of phosphorus being doped into the matrix of g-C3N4, causing greater lattice distortions as well as interplanar distance [39]. It should be noted that the P-doped sample shows only the g-C3N4 phase because the melamine precursor was condensed thoroughly and no further impurities are present [15]. Additionally, the mean particle size of the Pd NPs, calculated using the Scherrer equation (d = Kλ/(βcosθ)) is about 11.07 nm. The XRD patterns of Bulk g-C3N4, g-C3N4 Nanosheet, and Porous g-C3N4 are represented in Fig. S6. The FE-SEM (P-pCN and P-pCN/Pd) and TEM (P-pCN/Pd) analysis of the samples were carried out to characterize the morphology and structure. The P-pCN and P-pCN/Pd catalysts (Fig. 3 ) both exhibit the layered-platelet-like surface structure, but these layers are curlier in P-pCN/Pd than those of P-doped Porous CN after sedimentation of Pd NPs. Moreover, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental analysis proved the composition of the catalysts. Due to the represented EDS data in Fig. 4 , the existence of C, N, P, and Pd elements in the prepared catalysts were observed. The TEM image of the synthesized P-pCN/Pd catalyst obviously reveal the presence of well-dispersed Pd nanoparticles on the surface of the catalyst (Fig. 5 ). EDS elemental analysis of the prepared samples is represented in Figs. S7–13. By means of UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) measurement the optical absorption of the samples was explored (Fig. 6 ). The DRS of the prepared samples is listed in Table 1 , showing the typical broad absorption band. Egap (the optical band gap energies) of the synthesized g-C3N4 based materials were determined through extrapolating a linear fitting in the Tauc Plot obtained from Kubelka-Munk Function F(R) [40]. The optical band gap of g-C3N4 is 2.76 eV, while that of the P-pCN photocatalyst is reduced to 2.48 eV because of changing the electronic property by phosphorous doping and C defect [41]. Considering the oxidization role of holes is related to the position of the valence band, the S and P doping causes the valence band position to move in a positive direction, hence increasing the oxidation activity of the holes and boosting the photocatalytic performance. According to the reported literature, Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) studies have proved that P single doping produces more defects than S single doping [42]. The separation rates of charge pairs in the P-pCN and S-pCN samples were faster, which was caused by the generated electrons being trapped in the defects, preventing direct recombination of photo-generated charges [43,44]. The introduction of the P element will not only replace the C element but also cause defects which may lead to the formation of unpaired electrons on P conjugated the aromatic g-C3N4 rings [42]. Pd NPs can noticeably increase the optical absorption of the catalyst, which leads to improved effectiveness of P-pCN/Pd through the separation of charge carriers. The band gap of the as-prepared catalysts shifted noteworthy to longer wavelengths (Redshift), resulting in better photo-oxidation ability. The band gap of the prepared photocatalysts is represented in Figs. S14–20. Basically, an increased rate of recombination of photo-induced charges confirming the low photocatalytic efficiency can be discerned by a strong Photoluminescence (PL) signal. A strong PL emission band reveals a high recombination rate of photo-generated electrons and holes of porous g-C3N4, as shown in Fig. 7 [45]. More the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs, the less photocatalytic activity. The P-doped porous g-C3N4 sample shows the lower PL emission intensity than porous g-C3N4, proposing that doping P in the texture of g-C3N4 can create new surface states near the conduction band bottom which promote the separation and slow down the photo-induced charge carrier's recombination [46]. When P replaces the C atoms in g-C3N4, four of its valence electrons are involved with N atoms to form bonds. The isolated electron of P is delocalized into the π-electron conjugated structure of g-C3N4. This would generate P+ centers and inhibit the recombination of photo-generated carriers [47,48]. After decorating Pd, the PL emission intensity is reduced indicating the enhanced charge separation resulted from the effective transferring of excited electrons of g-C3N4 to Pd NPs and preventing the direct recombination of electron-hole pairs [49]. The same mechanism could be generalized for Cu and Ag metals. Hence, the enhanced charge carrier's separation contributes to the improved visible-light photocatalytic activities of P-doped porous g-C3N4/Pd photocatalyst. The specific surface areas (SSA) of the b are g-C3N4 has been reported to be 4–7 m2 g−1 by using melamine as the precursor [35,50]. By applying two general ways such as templating methods (hard or soft) and post-synthetic exfoliation strategy the SSA of the g-C3N4 can be improved [51]. The SSAs of the P-pCN and P-pCN/Pd materials obtained in the current investigation are reported in Table 2 . The textural properties of the prepared graphitic based catalysts were affected by doping. The SSA value acquired for P-pCN decreased with respect to the porous g-C3N4 sample. The explanation of this observation might be because of the condensation pathway of melamine and the reaction of the by-products with O2 of the added H3PO4 at high temperatures [15]. The SSA of the P-pCN/Pd catalyst increased due to the high volume parameters of pores. Besides, the pore structure of the P-pCN/Pd sample was calculated by N2 sorption measurements (77 K). The illustrated isotherm of the sample (Fig. 8 ) is a classical type IV, pointing out the mesoporous nature of the prepared photocatalyst with an average pore size of 26.549 nm. The prepared photocatalyst was characterized by XPS analysis to investigate the chemical environment and surface elemental composition. The introduction of P atoms into the crystal matrix of CN and forming P–N bond by substituting C atoms is evident from Fig. 9 . The C 1s spectrum (Fig. 9-a), exhibit two main carbon species peaks centering at 288.93 eV and 285.1 eV. They can be assigned to the sp2-hybridized C atoms bonded to the NH2 groups in the triazine ring (NCN). The extra peak located at 284.97 eV in the C 1s spectrum, is related to the CC bonds (impurity C species). For N 1s spectrum (Fig. 9-b), three contributions with the binding energy at 398.6 eV, 398.9 eV, and 400.6 eV can be seen. The peak located at 398.6 eV is attributed to N atoms in the aromatic ring (CNC). The peak at 398.9 eV is ascribed to the tertiary sp2-hybridized N groups (N–(C)3), and the peak at 400.6 eV confirms the presence of free amino species (CNH) [52]. The high-resolution XPS analysis of C 1s and N 1s reveals the existence of triazine units in the P-doped g-C3N4 structure. The P 2p spectrum (Fig. 9-c) shows a main peak centering at 134.0 eV which is contributed to the P–N coordination, indicating the replacement of C atoms by the P atoms to form P–N bonds during the doping process [53,54]. The Pd 3d Spectrum (Fig. 9-d) shows a clear doublet, which refers to Pd 3d 3/2, and Pd3d5/2 [55]. The peaks at 340.9 eV and 336 eV are assigned to Pd (0). XPS analysis for P-doped Porous g-C3N4/Pd determined the P and Pd content to be 4.49 and 2.98 W%, respectively."
8,Calculation methods,"3.2 Calculation methods The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out by using the Quantum Espresso Simulation Package [56,57]. Electronic exchange-correlation effects and the electronic band structure were modeled with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) using Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional [58]. The kinetic energy cut-off for wavefunctions and that of charge density have been set to 44 and 450 Ry, respectively. The calculations used a 2 × 2 × 1 k-point mesh for Brillouin zone sampling and were executed with the Monkhorst–Pack scheme [59]. Electronic optimization has been carried out through self-consistent field interactions with an energy cut-off of 1 × 10−6 eV. To consider the long-range weak interactions, the dispersion corrections to the total energies were included through the Grimms semiempirical method (DFT-D3) [60]. 3.2.1 Calculation details The aim of this calculation is essentially obtaining structures that be able to appropriately reproduce the corresponding band gap extracted from the band structure and DOS spectra consistent with the experimental results. As the starting point, we reproduced the g-C3N4 unit cell from the CIF file included in the Supporting Information of reference [61] called “g–C3N4–heptazine-Phase 3” with orthorhombic symmetry in ABA form, represented in Fig. 8. Consequently, to take the P doped g-C3N4 structure, carbon atoms numbered C6 and C12 has been replaced by P atoms in the three layers system. Optimization of this system through relaxation of the structure led to the optimized geometry (1) afforded in Fig. 10 , in which the cell parameters are as follow: a = b = 7.06100 A°, c = 6.41370 A°, α = β = 90.00° and γ = 59.98°. Also, some typical bonding and interlayer distances are as reported here: P1–N1, P1–N2, P1–N3, and C1–C2 are 1.59, 1.56, 1.56, and 6.41 A°, respectively. Fig. 11 shows band structure and density of states (DOS) spectra of the three layers P doped g-C3N4. The calculated band gap of about 2.5 eV close to the experimental value of 2.59 eV can be estimated from these spectra. Furthermore, to calculate the band gap of Pd supported P-doped g-C3N4 (3), its initial structure has been prepared through expansion of three layers P doped g-C3N4 (1) structure in x and y dimensions as 2 × 2 × 1, adding 20 A° vacuum above the upper layer (A), the inclusion of smallest Pd nanoparticle containing 13 atoms of Pd in such a way that the (001) plane of the P doped g-C3N4 be nearly parallel to the (111) plane of the Pd nanoparticle, according to the more intense absorptions of these two species observed in the XRD pattern. The initial starting (2) and the final optimized structures (3) of the Pd supported P-doped g-C3N4 are displayed in Fig. 12 . In this case the cell parameters are, a = b = 14.12197 A°, c = 26.41369 A°, α = β = 90.00° and γ = 59.98°. Clearly, 3 shows buckled conformation in its optimized geometry and three of the Pd atoms are attached to three N atoms of the A layer and typically distances in between P1–P2 and Pd1–N1 are 2.30 and 2.14 A°, respectively, the latter one may be indicating of the partially covalent-electrostatic character of the Pd–N interaction. Fig. 13 shows the density of states (DOS) spectra of 3, from which the band gap is approximated to be in the range of 1.2–1.3 eV, notably less than that of 1, as a result of the presence of the Pd nanoparticles."
9,Evaluation of the photocatalytic activity of prepared photocatalysts toward photo-oxidation of alcohols,"3.3 Evaluation of the photocatalytic activity of prepared photocatalysts toward photo-oxidation of alcohols The prepared photocatalysts were screened for the oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol under a blue LED source (visible light irradiation). G-C3N4 possesses permanent photoactive nature with some defects which persuaded us to modify it in order to achieve more efficiency. In this investigation conditions like functionalization of at an atomic level (heteroatom doping) and metal immobilizing on the surface helped to accelerate the oxidation reaction via adsorption of visible light. Based on this strategy, the photo-oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde under blue LED irradiation was studied as a model reaction to assess the most optimal condition of reaction. Table 3 reveals the derived results. Diverse amounts of P-pCN/Pd catalyst were investigated and the best result was acquired by applying 10 mg of catalyst. (Table 3, entry 4). Experiments identified the oxidation reaction neither proceeds in the dark nor in the absence of the catalyst. (Table 3, entries 1 and 7). At the next stage, optimization of hydrogen peroxide concentration was considered and according to the obtained results, 98% of photocatalytic conversion of benzyl alcohol was attained by 1.5 mmol hydrogen peroxide under 1 h blue LED irradiation. Eventually, the reaction condition including a solution of benzyl alcohol (1 mmoL) in acetonitrile (2 mL) with 0.01 g of P-pCN/Pd in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (1.5 mmoL) and irradiation by 4 × 3 W blue LED at room temperature was chosen as the best-optimized condition. Table 4 shows the photo-oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol by all prepared photo-catalysts under optimum conditions. All reactions were performed with 10 mg of catalysts in acetonitrile. Moreover, the reactions were performed with almost similar metal loading in the catalyst. After optimizing the reaction conditions, the efficiency of the prepared photo-catalyst and possibility of the reaction was studied in the photo-oxidation reactions of a variety of alcohols. Table 5 depicts the photo-oxidation of benzyl alcohol derivatives containing functional groups (-NO2, –OCH3 and X) into their corresponding benzaldehydes and the results show the selectivity. Stimulatingly, this approach is appropriate for a broad variety of aromatic alcohols carrying both electron-withdrawing and electron-releasing groups. As it is accessible in Table 5, the alcohols with electron releasing groups (Table 5, entry 6) reacted faster compared to electron-withdrawing substitutions (Table 5, entries 3 and 4). All the aryl alcohols were oxidized to a single and expected product in great yields. According to Table 5, P-pCN/Pd photocatalyst enables us not only to form benzaldehydes in short reaction times but also to perfectly convert benzyl alcohol to the corresponding benzaldehydes under the optimized conditions. Conditions: Substrate (1 mmol), H2O2 (1.5 mmol), acetonitrile (2 mL), 43W domestic bulb, room temperature. The % in parenthesis indicate the level of selectivity in oxidation reaction. The isolated yield is based on the conversion or completion of the reaction in given time. Our main objective was to design and develop photocatalyst which can facilitate the oxidation of alcohols selectively using the most sustainable energy source. This would not only render the procedure greener but adaptable for general use in industries and academia. To prove the ability of the designed photocatalyst for BA conversion purposes, the scale-up production of benzaldehydes was studied under the optimized conditions. The results are summarized in Table 6 . The photo-oxidation reaction proceeded successfully, and the product was attained in high yields almost comparable to those in the small-scale reactions. The results of scale-up tests revealed that the purified product yield was 80% if the reaction scale was 100 mmol."
10,Comparison of photocatalytic activity,"3.4 Comparison of photocatalytic activity The photocatalytic activity of P-pCN/Pd was compared with that of some previously reported g–C3N4–catalyzed benzyl alcohol oxidation reactions (Table 7 ), specifying the higher efficiency of the prepared photocatalyst in terms of time and yield compared to reported ones."
11,Recycling performance of the P-pCN/Pd photocatalyst,"3.5 Recycling performance of the P-pCN/Pd photocatalyst In order to establish the P-pCN/Pd catalyst repeatability, some investigations were performed using benzyl alcohol as the substrate in acetonitrile (Fig. 14 ). After each reaction was completed, the photocatalyst was recovered using a centrifuge. Then, it was washed with ethanol and reemployed for another test. The XRD patterns of the catalyst and the reused catalyst are represented in Fig. 15 . The catalyst could be reused up to seven consecutive runs with no remarkable loss of photocatalytic efficiency, indicating the high stability of the prepared catalyst during the photocatalytic processes."
12,Conclusion,"A series of g-C3N4 based photocatalysts have been designed and prepared through the condensation and thermolysis of melamine and urea. The synthesized P-pCN/Pd photocatalyst exhibited optimized performance in the selective photo-oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol under visible light due to the surface defects and more active sites. Elemental doping (phosphorous) in the structure of the conjugated polymer can tune and decrease the band gap and enhance the photo-oxidation ability of the holes originated by photons. Meanwhile, nitrogen-rich structures can aid the fixation of Pd NPs on the surface of the catalyst. These Pd NPs act as co-catalyst and trap photo-generated electrons as well as reducing the recombination process. The efficiency of the prepared photocatalyst, synthesizing and applying durable catalyst over several reaction cycles, synthesizing a variety of benzaldehydes in a green pathway, small amount of the affordable photocatalyst, and environmentally benign are some salient features of our work. Most of the previous catalysts employed for photo-oxidation reaction have not been used in any practical application in industries owing to prolonged reaction time, a sophisticated experimental setup which requires using high-pressure reactors, and complication involved to irradiate the mixture with visible-light. So, it is expected that our simple but novel approach can be extended to provide new insight for the designing of new photocatalysts to apply in the field of catalysis."
