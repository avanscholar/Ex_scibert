0,Introduction,"Catalysis is a key factor in the conversion of liquid or gaseous fuels into hydrogen. Many studies about hydrogen production for fuel cells deal with the use of two types of organic fuels: (i) oxygen-containing compounds, such as methanol or ethanol or (ii) hydrocarbons, e.g. natural gas, LPG, and gasoline [1–7]. At time when environmental problems are some of the world's biggest concerns, development of new energy conversion technologies is crucial. Steam reforming, in which an alcohol feed is reacted with steam, can generate a hydrogen-rich reformate stream on-site. The advantages of alcohols include facile handling and transport, and ability to be synthesized from a variety of biomass feedstock. Moreover, both methanol and ethanol can be used in the steam reforming reactions under mild operation conditions for producing hydrogen. The reformate gas contains also carbon monoxide, whose concentration must be lower than the tolerance limit of low temperature polymeric electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells (FCs) (50ppm) or up to 1vol.% if a high temperature PEM (HTPEM) fuel cell is applied [8]. PEM fuel cells are expected to find application as combined heat and power generation stationary systems, as a substitute for batteries in portable devices and in transportation [9]. In the case of the steam reforming of methanol (SRM), proposed catalysts can be divided in two main groups: copper-based and group 8–10 metal-based catalysts [10,11]. Other metals, like cobalt, have been barely studied in methanol reforming or decomposition [11–15]. In contrast to the SRM, cobalt is a well-known and promising active phase in the steam reforming of ethanol (SRE). There were made extensive studies on developing a catalyst for the SRE which could operate at relatively low temperature without by-products formation, which is also resistant to carbon deposition [16–28]. Catalyst active phase can be deposited on many support types, which can be divided in a few main groups with: (i) acidic, (ii) basic and (iii) redox properties. One of the most popular supports in catalysis is alumina, nevertheless, it is also known from their acidic properties of its surface which are very undesirable in the SRE process. It leads to dehydration of ethanol to ethylene, which is strong precursor for carbonaceous deposit formation on the catalyst what results in its fast deactivation [16–22,25,28,29–32]. Therefore, numerous efforts have been dedicated to explore another active and stable supports, like La2O3, CeO2, ZrO2, MgO, SiO2, ZnO or hydrotalcite [16–43]. The addition of some of those oxides to Al2O3 affects its final acidity. Moreover, several research groups investigated ethanol reforming on catalysts containing cobalt supported on ZnO or ZnO-Al2O3 [23–29], and alumina is only a small additive to ZnO support and its role is improvement of thermal stability of zinc oxide together with minimalizing the impact of its strong acidic sites. It has been also reported that addition of basic promoters (Li, Na, K, Mg, La and Ce) is very effective in improving the performance of catalysts for the SRE [16–19,27,29,32,35–43]. The main role of alkali dopants in the SRE process is proposed to promote the removal of carbonaceous deposits or inhibit their formation by favouring water adsorption or neutralizing the support acidic sites responsible for ethylene formation and polymerization [17]. Llorca et al. [27] showed that sodium addition (0–1wt%) to a 10wt% Co/ZnO catalyst improved the stability of the catalyst in the SRE. Also, bulk cobalt oxide [31] and cobalt oxide supported on stainless steel wires [32] were investigated in the SRE reaction at moderate temperature. While undoped cobalt oxide underwent massive carbon deposition process, potassium was able to stop the over reduction of cobalt oxide and thereby prevent formation of large amount of carbon [32]. Espinal et al. [40,41] studied potassium-promoted (0–2wt%) cobalt hydrotalcites which were very stable in long-term experiments due to reduction of the number and strength of acidic sites even under high loads of both ethanol and bioethanol. Catalysts were generating only small amounts of carbon deposition. In the later research of Espinal et al. [41] have showed that potassium-promoted cobalt hydrotalcites supported over cordierite and placed in a catalytic membrane reactor with composite Pd-Ag selective membrane performed with very high efficiency. The pure hydrogen has been obtained in the permeate stream. After 650h of operation no carbon accumulation has been observed, even with very small excess of water vapour in the reaction mixture. They found that it was possibile due to the presence of CoO only, without metallic palladium in their catalyst. Ogo et al. [42] showed that thanks to 1–2wt% of potassium loading on Co/Al2O3 catalyst, the catalyst performance was stabilized as well as by-product (CH4 and C2H4) and coke formations were suppressed. Authors concluded that potassium addition has had a very positive effect on catalyst performance. The formation of Co0 CoO core-shell structure over Co/K/Al2O3 catalyst was effective for improvement of catalyst activity suggesting that the CoO species are highly active in ethanol steam reforming. What is more, in situ IR measurements revealed that thanks to potassium presence the adsorbed ethanol forms stable acetate species, which improves hydrogen selectivity. Alumina support was also modified with other additives like lanthanum and cerium oxides [30]. Nevertheless, according to Ávila-Neto et al. [30], under SRE without excess of water (EtOH:H2O=1:3mol:mol), the nature of the support seems to have no direct effect on carbon formation and catalyst deactivation. The good catalytic performance was also showed by catalysts containing cobalt, zinc oxide and aluminium oxide [23,25,26,29,43]. According to Wang et al. [44] addition of Al2O3 to support have two effects. Firstly, it enhances the interactions between cobalt and a catalyst support and, secondary, alumina increases the surface area and improves cobalt particles dispersion. Cobalt catalysts tested in the SRE have been prepared by various methods. These include urea hydrolysis [26], incipient wetness impregnation [22,24,27,34,35,38,39], co-precipitation [23,29,33,40,41,43] and citrate complexation [20,43]. The most popular method is incipient wetness impregnation. The choice of preparation method or solvent is very important in terms of physico-chemical properties presented by catalysts. From the results given by Lucredio et al. [22] it can be inferred that the thermal treatment is the most important step in obtaining good dispersion and small crystallites of active phase. Even occurrence of smaller metal crystallites on γ-Al2O3 than on SiO2 support does not allow achieving of better Co/Al2O3 catalyst performance during the SRE. The acid nature of this support influences the performance of the reaction and the dehydration of ethanol is favoured. According to another statement proposed by Lucredio et al. [22] Co3O4 on Al2O3 is found to be interacting with the Al2O3, which impedes aggregation of Co species during the reduction process and thus decrease the metal particle size. It is a known fact that active metal particle size plays a key role in determining catalyst stability during the SRE. The preparation route should lead to the formation of small and stable metal particles. This can be achieved by methods that promote the interaction between the metal particles and the support. However, depending on the characteristics of the support, the reduction of metal oxides (e.g., especially Ni and Co oxides) can be hindered due to strong interactions with the support. In addition, the formation of non-reducible mixed oxides such as cobalt aluminate during the calcination or activation steps can also hinder reduction [17,18]. According to results reported by Barroso et al. [25] the main phases showed on XRD patterns of CoZnAl catalysts after calcination at high temperature (700°C) are ZnAl2O4 and CoAl2O4. These phases are also visible on the TPR profiles where reduction occurs in high temperature regions. According to authors the improved behaviour of cobalt-rich catalysts was related to the presence of Co3O4. To achieve the effect of cobalt oxide phase supported on the ZnO-Al2O3 phase lower calcination temperature seemed to be reasonable. The goal for this work is a catalyst for on-site production of hydrogen-rich gas from alcohols, ethanol or/and methanol, by their steam reforming proceeded in the same processor, at the same (or very similar) process conditions, at as low as possible process temperature. Both alcohols could be alternatively used as a feed in hydrogen small generators for fuel cell applications. In the case of the SRE, bioethanol fermentation broth was used. It is obvious that transporting a feedstock rich in water over long distances, to large installations producing hydrogen from ethanol at industrial scale, could not be recommended from economical point of view. However, our proposition is concerned with on-site production of hydrogen-rich gas in small generators for scattered fuel cell applications. Bio-ethanol almost everybody can make by himself and after filtration only it can be ready for use as a feed for the generator. The opinion is also expressed [45] that by circumventing the distillation step, the process of reforming crude ethanol (i.e. fermentation broth) provides us with the ability to produce H2 from crude ethanol solution in a cost effective manner. Aiming to obtain catalysts with favourable properties for the SRE and the SRM, the effects of potassium promotion and preparation method of cobalt/zinc oxide materials were studied. A small amount of alumina was used to stabilize catalyst performance. Two series of catalysts were prepared, the first one by using the co-precipitation method and the second – by using the citrate method. Potassium was incorporated into catalysts in one step along with cobalt, zinc and alumina in the case of the citrate method. For catalysts prepared by the co-precipitation method, potassium was added by incipient wetness impregnation. Our earlier studies of Co-ZnO-Al2O3 catalysts have shown that the optimum amount of cobalt active phase for the SRE is approximately 24wt.% [23]."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The first series of cobalt catalysts was prepared by co-precipitation from Zn(CH3COO)2, Al(NO3)3 and Co(CH3COO)2 aqueous solutions. The precipitation was accomplished at 40°C by addition of (NH4)2CO3 solution, drop by drop, under continuous stirring of the suspension. After ageing of the precipitate at 55°C for 3h, the suspensions were filtered. The filtrates were washed with absolute ethanol, in order to remove water. The obtained solids were dried overnight at 110°C and then calcined at 400°C for 6h. Potassium (1 or 2wt%) was added by incipient wetness impregnation using an aqueous solution of KNO3. After impregnation, potassium-doped catalysts were dried over night at 110°C and then calcined at 400°C. The catalysts: unpromoted, promoted with 1wt% and 2wt% of potassium were labelled as 0 K-P, 1 K-P, and 2 K-P. Concerning the catalysts prepared with the citrate method, citric acid was added to an aqueous solution that contained all the required salts, Zn(CH3COO)2, Al(NO3)3, Co(CH3COO)2 and KNO3. The molar ratio of metal ions (Zn2+ +Al3+ +Co2+ +K+)/citric acid was 1/1. The resultant solutions were evaporated on a water bath. The obtained solids were dried at 110°C and then calcined at 400°C for 6h. The catalysts: unpromoted, promoted with 1wt% and 2wt% of potassium were labelled as 0 K-C, 1 K-C, and 2 K-C. The average amount of alumina in each of the catalysts was ~4wt%. All catalyst samples were pressed, crushed and sieved, and the 0.15–0.3mm fraction was used for characterization and catalytic measurements. Prior to the studies all catalysts were in-situ reduced with hydrogen at 400°C for 1h. Because one of the aims of our studies was developing a catalyst for the low- or moderate temperature steam reforming of alcohols we decided to pre-treat (to calcine and to pre-reduce) all catalysts at the temperature as low as possible, i.e. at 400°C, even if the SRE effects were for comparison reasons measured also at higher temperatures. It was reasonable as it was shown in one of our previous article that Co/(ZnO-Al2O3) catalysts containing ~20wt% of cobalt active phase (as it is in this paper) are able to convert ethanol at 400–420°C [43], especially when potassium modifier was added. The low pretreatment temperature allowed avoiding formation of very large crystallites of the active phase and sintering of the support and prevented all catalyst components from reaction toward hard to reduce double metal oxides."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) was used to determine the bulk content of cobalt in the catalysts. The spectra were obtained with an XRF spectrometer (Canberra 1510) equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled Si(Li) detector. The AXIL software package for spectra deconvolution and for the calculation of cobalt content was used. The porosity and BET surface area of catalysts were measured by the low-temperature (−196°C) nitrogen adsorption in the ASAP 2405 N v1.0 analyser (Micromeritics). The average pore diameter and the pore volume were calculated from desorption isotherms using the Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. Hydrogen chemisorption was measured in an Autosorb-1-C analyser (Quantachrome). Prior to the measurements, catalysts were reduced in situ with hydrogen at 400°C for 1h. Then, they were cooled down to 300°C under flowing H2, degassed at that temperature under vacuum of 5×10−7 Pa and, after cooling to 40°C, the hydrogen chemisorption was measured. The uptake of hydrogen was determined by extrapolating the straight-line portion of the total hydrogen chemisorption isotherm (up to the equilibrium pressure of 13.3kPa) to zero pressure. The surface area of the cobalt active phase was calculated assuming a chemisorption stoichiometry Co:H=1:1 and that the surface area occupied by one atom of hydrogen is 0.065nm2. The average size of cobalt crystallites was calculated assuming their spherical shape from the equation d =(6×103)/(g Co × S Co ), where g Co is the density of cobalt and S Co is the surface area of cobalt (m2/g Co ). X-ray powder diffraction patterns of catalysts were recorded with the Empyrean (PANalytical) diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation at 40kV/20mA at λ=1.54187Å and PIXcel3D detector. The data were collected at room temperature in the 2θ range of 15–100° with intervals of 0.026°. The International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD) PDF-4+ database was used for phase identification. The average size of Co3O4 crystallites was estimated from X-ray diffraction line broadening of the appropriate peaks corresponding to Co3O4 (2θ=59.35°) with usage of Scherrer equation (Eq. 1). d = kλ/βcosθ where k is the dimensionless shape factor, λ is the wave length, β is the width at half height of the maximum intensity in radiant, and θ is the diffraction angle. Temperature-programmed reduction of catalysts was carried out in an AMI-1 analyser (Altamira Instruments Inc.) using 0.05 g of the catalyst. A 6% H2-Ar mixture was used at a flow rate of 30cm3·min−1 with a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1 (25–800°C). The water vapour formed during reduction was removed in a cold trap (immersed in a liquid nitrogen-methanol slush) placed before of the thermal conductivity detector (TCD)."
4,Catalytic measurements,"2.3 Catalytic measurements The steam reforming of ethanol was carried out in a fixed-bed continuous-flow quartz reactor. The catalysts (0.1g) were diluted (at the weight ratio 1:10) with grains of quartz in order to ensure constant temperature in the catalytic layer. The aqueous solution of ethanol (EtOH:H2O molar ratio equal to 1:21, simulating a typical bioethanol fermentation broth with 10.85wt% of ethanol concentration) was supplied by a mass flow controller (Bronkhorst) to an evaporator (140°C) and the reactant vapours (at a flow rate of 100ml/min), without dilution with any inert gas, were fed to the reactor. The reaction temperature was measured in the centre of the catalyst+quartz bed, and was varied from 350°C to 600°C. The temperature was increased stepwise with 2h soak at each temperature. In the case of the steam reforming of methanol, the reaction feed consisted of 5% methanol and 7.5% H2O with total flow rate of 100ml/min (helium as a balance gas). The reaction temperature was varied from 325°C to 500°C. The analysis of the reaction mixture and the reaction products, for SRE, were carried out on-line by means of two gas chromatographs. One of them, Varian CP-3800 was equipped with two capillary columns, the first one contained a porous polymer Porapak Q (for all organics, carbon dioxide and water vapour) and the second of them – an activated molecular sieve 5Å (for methane and carbon monoxide analysis). Helium was used as a carrier gas and a TCD detector was employed. The hydrogen concentration was analysed by the second gas chromatograph, Chromatron GCHF 18.3, using a column packed with an activated charcoal, nitrogen as a carrier gas and a TCD detector. In the case of the SRM, the reaction products were analysed with usage of Shimadzu GC14B with two packed columns, the first one contained a porous polymer Porapak and second – Carboxen. Helium was used as a carrier gas and TCD and FID detectors were employed."
5,Coke formation measurements under the SRE conditions,"2.4 Coke formation measurements under the SRE conditions The studies of the catalyst coking in the steam reforming of ethanol were performed by the gravimetric method, using the conventional TG121 microbalance system (Cahn), under dynamic conditions in a quartz reactor with a continuous flow of ethanol-water vapours. The sensitivity of the balance was 0.1kg. Those experiments simulated the activity measurement tests but the catalyst sample was placed on a small quartz plate. The in-situ reduced (with hydrogen at 400°C for 1h) catalyst samples (0.01g, 0.15–0.30mm) were cooled down to 300°C in a stream of hydrogen. Then, the reactor was flushed with nitrogen and the catalyst samples were heated up to the 600°C in the stream of the ethanol and water vapour mixture (molar ratio of EtOH:H2O=1:4, 0.27mol/h, without diluting with any inert gas) with the heating rate of 5°C/min."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Table 1 compiles the synthesized catalysts along with their cobalt contents, specific surface area and cobalt surface area. It can be seen that physico-chemical properties were affected by preparation method rather than by potassium addition. Co-precipitation allowed us to achieve higher pore volumes in contrary to the pore diameter, which in the case of both preparation methods remained at the same level. The P-series catalysts showed higher specific surface area and smaller cobalt crystallites. The catalysts prepared by the co-precipitation method have a little higher cobalt content in catalysts (26–28wt%). Table 1 contains also the mean size of cobalt species crystallites (in means of Co3O4 and ZnxCo3-xO4) in fresh catalysts as deduced from the Scherrer equation. Particle sizes were in the range of 16–23nm and promoter incorporation does not seem to have a significant effect on cobalt oxide particle size. Mean sizes of metallic cobalt crystallites were determined from chemisorption and they are larger than those of cobalt oxide in fresh catalysts (61–72nm for P-series and 92–165nm for C-series). The presence of potassium promoter increased a little the average size of cobalt crystallites and decreased the active phase surface area. The fresh samples were analysed by the X-ray diffraction (Fig. 1 ). The XRD profiles of all samples are very similar. The patterns show typical reflections of a wurtzite type phase (ZnO ICDD 01-78-3325, Zn0.9Co0.1O ICDD 01-78-3332, Zn0.8Co0.2O ICDD 01-78-3335) and spinel type phase (Co3O4 ICDD 00-42-1467 and ZnCo2O4 ICDD 00-23-1390). According to diffraction patterns it can be seen that zinc oxide is the main phase. It is important to note, that it is quite difficult to distinguish between the diffraction lines of ZnO and Zn1-xCoxO or Co3O4 and ZnxCo3-xO4. Pairs of these compounds have the same wurtzite (P63mc) and spinel cubic structure (Fd3m), respectively, differing only slightly in the size of the lattice. Taking into account the catalyst composition and preparation methods, ZnO, Co3O4 and double oxides are the most probable phases. CoAl2O4, Co2AlO4 or ZnAl2O4 binary oxides are thermodynamically allowed but the low calcination temperature (400°C) makes it rather difficult to create those compounds as separate phases. The similarity of XRD patterns indicates that preparation method and the addition of potassium in the studied range do not affect the crystalline phases of the catalysts. The temperature-programmed reduction profiles show some differences in reducibility between P- and C-series catalysts (Fig. 2 ). All TPR profiles are characteristic for samples composed of cobalt oxide and hardly reducible oxide like ZnO [23]. All profiles consist of three peaks which separation is better marked in the case of C-series catalysts. First two of them (clearly seen unresolved, for P-catalysts) may correspond to the well known two-step reduction of cobalt oxide to metallic cobalt (Co3O4 →CoO→Co) [39]. The next range (above 620°C - P-series, and 545°C - C-series) resulted from reduction of cobalt oxides much more strongly interacting with the support to the abovementioned binary cobalt-zinc oxides as well as with the reduction of some part of ZnO, facilitated by the presence of metallic cobalt [23]. Addition of potassium clearly shifted the onset of reduction to lower temperature only for catalysts from P-series what is in agreement with Casanovas et al. study [39]. In contrary, TPR profiles of C-catalysts extend to higher temperatures and potassium addition did not lead to lowering of the reduction temperature of cobalt oxides. The reason of such behaviour could be potassium incorporation into the bulk of catalysts during preparation (where all catalyst components were simultaneously present in solutions used). It should be noted that alumina addition to the catalyst (~4wt% of Al2O3) did not impact the TPR results. According to the data collected by Wang et al. [44] reduction is only slightly hindered when alumina contend is in the range of 1–5wt% when compared with unmodified sample (Co/ZnO). What is more, only the high content of aluminium oxide (10wt% and more) affect reducibility of Co-ZnO-Al2O3 catalysts and results in increased content of double cobalt-aluminium oxides. When compared the TPR results with the size of crystallites and the surface area of cobalt active phase it is seen that the easier reduction of P-series catalysts resulted in smaller cobalt crystallites and higher active surface area than those in C-series catalysts. It is also easy to notice that under standard reduction conditions, i.e. at 400°C, acceptable for practical application of the catalyst in small, on-site used, hydrogen-rich gas generators, the amount of reduced, metallic cobalt in co-precipitated catalysts is higher, especially in potassium-promoted ones, then those in the C-series catalysts. It is result of the specificity of the citrate preparation method enabling much more homogeneous distribution of all catalyst components and, therefore, the higher amounts of binary oxides harder to reduction than that of single cobalt oxide."
8,Methanol steam reforming,"3.2 Methanol steam reforming The activity, selectivity and hydrogen yield over all catalysts in the steam reforming of methanol are plotted in Figs. 3 and 4 . It was found that the catalysts from both series provide comparable results. The dashed line in Fig. 4 depicts the selectivity to CO2 under conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium of the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction. All catalyst achieve equilibrium concentrations of CO2 only at high reaction temperatures (above 400°C). The main carbon-containing products of methanol reforming were CO2 and CO. Up to 375°C the methanol conversion is incomplete and hydrogen yield is low (0.4–2.1mol H2 from 1mol of MeOH) (Figs. 3 and 4). Unmodified catalysts start to provide complete methanol conversion (99–100%) at 400°C, while potassium modified – at 425°C (86–98%). At 400°C the process selectivity to carbon monoxide is very high (up to 68%) over unprompted catalyst. The potassium promoter did not affect significantly catalyst activity, but allowed to depress carbon monoxide formation, especially in the case of the P-series catalysts. For C-series catalysts this phenomena was not so visible what could be a result of potassium incorporation in one step with other catalyst components. At higher temperatures (425–500°C) catalyst activity and selectivity are very alike. It appears that at higher temperatures the preparation method and potassium incorporation do not have important effect on the catalyst performance in the SRM. The hydrogen yield was equal to 2.5–2.6mol H2 per one mole of MeOH and the selectivity to CO2 and CO is 63% and 37% for C-catalysts, and 64% and 35% for P-catalysts, respectively. The highest selectivity to carbon dioxide (along with 99–100% conversion of MeOH) was achieved on the 2 K-P catalyst (69%) at 400–420°C and on the 1 K-C (66%) at 450°C. The question on the reasons of beneficial effect of potassium promotion in the SRM is still open; our suggestion is increased chemisorption of water vapour on the K-promoted catalyst surface and increased rate of the WGS successive process. As it was mentioned in the introduction section, the SRM have not been studied extensively over Co-ZnO catalysts, hence straightforward comparison of results presented in this work with the literature data is not possible. Iwasa et al. [12] performed catalytic tests over a Co-ZnO catalyst (10wt% Co). That catalyst composition was the closest to catalysts described in this work, but the temperature of the SRM was as low as 220°C and the methanol conversion reached only 20.3%. Segal et al. [13] studied production of hydrogen by the SRM on Co/Al catalyst delivered from layered double hydroxides. At 400°C methanol conversion did not exceed 10%, in contrary to the conversion of methanol in the range of 99–100% in the case of unpromoted Co-ZnO-Al2O3 catalysts examined in this work. Though potassium was introduced to our catalysts, the SRM process selectivity toward carbon monoxide was quite high (30–39%). Taking into account the high selectivity to carbon monoxide during the SRM over the whole temperature range, the reaction pathway through methanol decomposition seems to be reasonable and it is in agreement with results of Palo et al. [10]. Cobalt, like other metals from the VIII group, predominantly catalyzes decomposition of methanol to CO and H2. However, as the CO and CO2 amounts are close to the equilibrium at higher temperature, the strong influence of this reaction on the SRM selectivity is indisputable. Summing up the behaviour of both series of catalysts in the steam reforming of methanol it is not easy to declare which catalyst showed the best performance. At temperatures ensuring MeOH conversion close to 100%, the hydrogen yield and selectivity achieved within each series are comparable, but always they are better for P-catalysts. Taking into account physico-chemical properties of all catalysts it is reasonable as the 0 K-P, 1 K-P and 2 K-P-catalysts have the high BET surface area along with the higher cobalt surface area and smaller cobalt crystallites. What is more, also the usage of Al2O3 to stabilize the catalysts, not as the main component (support) seems to result in better SRM process activity on Co-ZnO-Al2O3 catalyst when compared to performance of Co/Al mixed metal oxides catalysts delivered from layered double hydroxides [13]. From the catalysts with cobalt active phase examined under similar conditions we can find Co/Mn catalysts described by Papadopoulou et al. [49]. The pyrolytic decomposition of fumarate salts of cobalt and manganese allowed forming effective catalysts for the SRM, which performed with high efficiency. The SRM process was undertaken in condition adequate to those used in this research article (a feed containing 5% of the alcohol at a total flow rate of 100cm3 min−1). The catalyst with the Co/Mn molar ratio equal to 1/2 (similar to our Co/Zn ratio) allowed to complete methanol conversion at the temperature of ~450°C and, simultaneously, the process of the SRM selectivity to carbon dioxide reached as high level as ~55%. Results presented by Papadopoulou et al. [49] are comparable with those showed by Co-ZnO-Al2O3 and K-Co-ZnO-Al2O3 catalysts presented in this work and suggest that under proposed conditions cobalt catalysts with the new formula (Co/Mn), Co-ZnO-Al2O3 and K-Co-ZnO-Al2O3 are appropriate for a future application. It is also clear that because of rather large amounts of carbon monoxide formed over even the best catalyst, the hydrogen-rich gas generator for fuel cell applications will have to include also a supplemental WGS reactor for lowering CO concentration."
9,Ethanol steam reforming,"3.3 Ethanol steam reforming Cobalt catalysts were tested in the ethanol steam reforming reaction with the steam to ethanol molar ratio H2O:EtOH=21:1. The bio-derived ethanol is usually produced as an aqueous solution containing even only 8–12wt% of ethanol [50], what is close to that used in this article water-ethanol mixture (10.85wt% of EtHO). Regarding the possibility of using a bio-ethanol mixture instead of an ethanol/water solution, the excess of water during the SRE process leads to reduction of the carbon monoxide content in the reformed stream. Therefore, it could be advantageous to feed into the reactor a bio-ethanol mixture, allowing utilization of bio-derived ethanol without any distillation process. This aspect is economically relevant, taking into account that ethanol purification, extracting a large amount of water, has a high cost due to the ethanol/water azeotrope [50]. Figs. 5–7 show the evolution of ethanol conversion as well as the hydrogen yield and process selectivity at different reaction temperatures for all catalyst samples. It should be noticed that the SRE is a complex process which in the presence of catalysts with cobalt active phase begins with the dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde. Together with incomplete conversion of ethanol, it resulted in high process selectivity toward acetaldehyde at 350°C (Fig. 7). Starting from 420°C the steam reforming of acetaldehyde to hydrogen and the mixture of carbon oxides as well as the decomposition of acetaldehyde into methane and carbon monoxide takes place (Figs. 6 and 7). Also, the WGS reaction may proceed, what may result in consumption of carbon oxides and hydrogen (Figs. 5 and 6). Casanovas et al. [51] have pointed out the role of easy redox exchange between oxidized and reduced cobalt centres not only in the SRE or the SRM but also in the WGS reaction, where water acts as a reactant and as an oxidant. In line with the above statements in the 420–600°C temperature region the main products of the SRE were hydrogen, carbon dioxide and much smaller amounts of carbon monoxide and methane. During the SRE process at 420°C over the 0 K-C and 0 K-P-catalysts, the acetaldehyde is still present among reaction products. Only potassium addition provided complete acetaldehyde elimination from the SRE products at that low, 420°C, temperature. Potassium promoter increases also the hydrogen yield from 3.9 or 4.3mol of H2 per 1mol of EtOH for unpromoted 0 K-C and 0 K-P-catalysts respectively, to 5.4 for both 1 K-P and 1 K-C-catalysts, and to 5.5 for both 2 K-P and 2 K-C-catalysts (Fig. 5). Potassium incorporation (1wt%) also leads to the increase of the selectivity to hydrogen and carbon dioxide, from 90 to 95% in the case of hydrogen for both 1 K-C and 1 K-P-catalysts, while from 65 to 89% and from 71 to 90% for CO2, for 1 K-C and 1 K-P-catalysts, respectively. Since carbon monoxide is an undesirable product, suppression or even elimination of its formation is a very important issue. Potassium (1wt%) caused a decrease in the selectivity to carbon monoxide from 16 to 2.6% and from 11 to 2.8% for 1 K-C and 1 K-P-catalysts, respectively. The increase of the amount of potassium promoter from 1 to 2wt% caused further improvement of the SRE process selectivity at 420°C. The selectivity of hydrogen formation was raised to 97%, while that of carbon dioxide formation was increased to 92–93% over both catalysts promoted with 2wt% of potassium. The significant improvement of the whole SRE process selectivity at 420°C is clearly seen for potassium containing catalysts. Quite important changes can be also seen in the case of methane formation. The CH4 selectivity decreased with increasing amount of potassium from 11% to 8.3% and then to 4.7% for 0 K-C, 1 K-C and 2 K-C-catalysts respectively, and from 11% to 7.7% and then to 4.9% for 0 K-P, 1 K-P and 2 K-P-catalysts, respectively (Fig. 7). In the temperature range of 480–600°C the conversions and selectivity of the SRE process on all catalysts did not differ very much. Both catalysts series provide complete conversion of ethanol and high hydrogen yields (5.2–5.4mol of H2 per 1mol of EtOH). Selectivity to hydrogen and carbon dioxide are very high (97% in the case of hydrogen and 88% for carbon dioxide). Finally, the temperature increase from 480°C to 600°C caused carbon dioxide consumption via the reverse WGS reaction. This suggests that effect of potassium addition on the cobalt catalyst performance is strongly dependent on the reaction temperature, what was also observed by Espinal et al. [40] in the case of cobalt hydrotalcite-derived catalyst. The reverse WGS reaction was accompanied by formation of some amounts of carbon monoxide. The exception can be seen in the case of the 2 K-C catalyst at 600°C. The selectivity to methane rapidly increases together with the decrease of selectivity to carbon oxides and hydrogen what can be connected with stronger catalysts sintering at the high temperature. The trace amount of acetone (<0.5%) was only detected in the case of unpromoted catalysts at 350°C. Above results correspond with earlier research showing that alkali promoters significantly enhances catalyst performance in the SRE. Alkali metals are known to be a good donor of electrons in the catalytic systems changing the catalytic behaviour of many catalysts [32,35,40–43,46–48]. According to Juan-Juan et al. [46] in the presence of potassium active metal could be more accessible to the reactants and in consequences better catalyst performance could be achieved. It seems that easier reducibility and electronic enrichment of cobalt active phase due to potassium presence was accomplished by high catalyst activity and process selectivity at ~420°C. According to literature data, sodium addition to the Co/ZnO catalyst [27,39] promoted hydrogen production as well as improved catalyst stability when compared to unpromoted catalysts. The results achieved by Espinal et al. [40,41] showed that cobalt hydrotalcites catalyst doped with potassium allows even long term catalyst performance with high efficiency. The authors were able to create a catalytic system providing stable catalyst performance under quite stressful conditions together with absence of carbon deposition formation. Ogo et al. [42] investigated promoting effect of potassium on Co/Al2O3 catalyst for SRE process using operando DRIFTS technique. Authors concluded that formation of Co0 CoO core shell structure over Co/K/Al2O3 catalyst was effective for improvement of catalyst activity and for suppression of coke formation. They clarified that the adsorption of intermediate acetate onto metallic cobalt is stabilized by potassium addition, what brought high stability and activity of cobalt catalyst for SRE (in the terms of complete ethanol conversion, high hydrogen yield and suppression of methane formation and carbon deposition). Rio et al. [32] also came to the conclusion that limitation of elementary cobalt on the catalyst surface leads to prevention of acetone formation. The potassium-promoted catalysts from P- and C-series, described in this paper, were stable during the 2h periods at each temperature (except at 350°C). At 420°C, the presence of potassium allowed elimination of acetaldehyde from the SRE products, leading also to increased hydrogen selectivity and hydrogen yield. Increasing amount of potassium in catalysts from 1 to 2wt% resulted in further improvement of selectivity of the SRE process. It was also observed with increasing amounts of sodium addition in Co/ZnO catalysts [27] as well as in the case of cobalt hydrotalcites modified with increasing amounts of potassium [40]. The best performance in the SRE was obtained for the 2 K-P catalyst at 420–450°C. It is the lowest temperature range where the conversion of ethanol is complete, the hydrogen yield is the highest and the SRE selectivity is the most advantageous for hydrogen on-site production in small generator for fuel cell applications [43]. The more extensive study of Banach and Machocki [43] dealing with the long term (up to 25h) performance of Co-ZnO-Al2O3 and K-Co-ZnO-Al2O3 catalysts under more stressful conditions (lower EtOH:H2O molar ratio) allows for statement that cobalt catalysts doped with potassium are promising materials for its future investigation in the low temperature SRE reaction. However, a small WGS reactor in the hydrogen generator is necessary for lowering carbon monoxide concentration in reformate gas."
10,Coking of catalysts in the ethanol steam reforming,"3.4 Coking of catalysts in the ethanol steam reforming The catalyst coking measurements in the ethanol-water vapour stream (with the 1:4M ratio, i.e. with much lower concentration of water when compare to the reaction mixture used in the activity/selectivity tests; by design, in order to increase a rate of that potential, disadvantageous phenomenon) were carried out to investigate influence of the potassium content on the intensity of carbonaceous deposit formation over catalyst surface in the SRE process while the reaction temperature was raised. The catalyst weight changes during ethanol conversion were obtained from TG measurements. It can be observed that TG profiles result from two phenomena: the additional reduction of catalysts and carbon deposition (Fig. 8 ). The weight of the potassium promoted catalysts from the P-series shows initially stabilization, while at higher temperatures its decline have begun. In the case of the 0 K-P sample coke formation starts at 370°C, while in the temperature range above 515°C the weight loss is accentuated quite significantly. It proves that above that latter temperature, even with as low excess of water vapour in the reaction mixture as EtOH:H2O=1:4mol/mol (steam:carbon=1:2) and with a high partial pressure of ethanol (the reaction mixture was not diluted with any inert gas), the rate of coke gasification is higher than that of carbonaceous deposit formation and the surface of the catalyst is cleaned from the coke. When we are considering the C-series catalysts it can be seen that only potassium addition as high as 2wt% managed to stop the coke formation. For 1 K-C and 2 K-C samples initial weight loss can be clearly seen and for the 2 K-C catalyst its weight stabilizes at the temperatures higher than 460°C. The coke deposit formation began at 400°C (C-series), with maximum at 585°C for 0 K-C and 1 K-C (Table 2 ). The intensity of that phenomenon was quite high in the case of unmodified catalysts and always more intensive for catalysts prepared with citrate method. Significant factor that influences the coking of cobalt catalysts appeared to be the method of potassium addition to the catalysts. During catalysts preparation with citrate method potassium was introduced to the catalysts in one step with all other catalyst components, what may result in its distribution not only on the catalysts surface but also in the bulk. Probably due to this fact the 1 K-C catalyst undergoes coking quite strong in contrary to the 1 K-P sample. This is in agreement with results presented by other groups [30–32,40–43] where authors concluded that carbonaceous deposit formation occurs on the surface of elementary cobalt particles and potassium limits its formation on the surface of Co0. Nevertheless, an uneven distribution of potassium (consequence of impregnation method which was used) [32] and not enough potassium amount [32,42] may lead to the undesired Co0 formation and consequently to the progress of coking process and other side reactions [32]. The results of coking phenomena and activity/selectivity tests cannot be directly compared as reaction conditions were significantly different. However, gently suggested by results obtained over reduced unsupported Co and CoFe oxides by Abdelkader et al. [31]; in the SRE (the EtOH:H2O:Kr:Ar 1:3:0.6:11., the temperature ramp from 100 to 500°C) it could be seen that reforming occurs by ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde followed by acetaldehyde reforming taking place simultaneously with the WGS reaction. One of the sources of coke formation and catalysts deactivation was side dehydration reaction of ethanol to ethylene, followed by its decomposition or polymerization. Those observations stand in line with results obtained in this work. It is also known that amorphous carbon can be removed from the catalyst surface by Boudouard reaction. Galetti et al. [29] (EtOH:H2O=1:3.8+He) concluded that the occurrence of Boudouard reaction at 600°C improves the catalyst resistance to carbon deposition. They observed that when the catalyst is run at 600°C under reforming conditions, an increase in the CO selectivity with the simultaneous detriment to the CO2 selectivity is observed without any significant change in the H2 yield. At 400 and 500°C the rate of coke deposition is higher than the removal rate and the catalytic bed is deactivated by carbon deposits. This is due to the fact that, the Boudouard reaction is not thermodynamically favoured at low temperatures. Besides, the presence of potassium on the catalyst surface positively affects the gasification of deposited carbon. Everything mentioned above is in accordance with the results obtained for both catalysts series investigated in this work. It is visibly depictured (Fig. 8) that carbon deposit is removed at higher temperatures and potassium introduction during a separate stage of incipient wetness impregnation favours this phenomena. The results clearly proves that both 2 K-P and 2 K-C catalysts are resistant to coking under SRE conditions, even when the low EtOH:H2O=1:4M ratio and no inert gas in the reaction mixture are applied. What is more, the suppression of carbon formation over potassium modified catalysts with cobalt active phase has been recently reported in literature [32,40–43]. As it was mentioned in the introduction section researches agreed that potassium presence on the catalyst surface leads to the suppression of coke deposition and prevent cobalt over-reduction simultaneously with improving its performance during the SRE. Also, the performance of catalysts investigated in this work allowed us to state that potassium stops the deactivation process caused by the side reactions leading to catalyst coking. According to Banach and Machocki [43] the K-Co-ZnO-Al2O3 catalyst was able to avoid carbon formation at 420°C under more stressful reforming conditions (with the EtOH:H2O 1:15M ratio) for many hours. Moreover, what could be also is important for practical application of the SRE process, Espinal et al. [40,41] managed to prepare cobalt hydrotalcite catalyst doped with potassium and supported on cordierite which operate under the SRE at the temperature of 550°C without sings of deactivation from 300h [40] to 650h [41]. The reports of Espinal et al. are the only ones in which catalyst is stable under SRE with a small excess of water only simultaneously without any inert gas in the reaction mixture. The SRE reaction required, however, the higher temperature (550°C) than that used in this work. As it is seen in Fig. 8 for P-series catalysts, at that temperature gasification dominates over coke deposition. We cannot predict if their catalyst (KCo/Mg/Al) would be appropriate for the SRM reaction and whether optimum temperature for both SRE and SRM processes would the same. In other reports, e.g. [32], catalysts also performed stably and without formation of carbon deposition in the reaction mixture without of significant water excess. However, the feed was strongly diluted with an inert gas (1.83vol.% EtOH, 11vol.% H2O, inert gas), i.e. with a very low partial pressure of ethanol and as a consequence – the absolute amounts of reaction products, including carbon deposit, were also very small what could be non-transferable to more genuine process. The results obtained for the K-Co-ZnO-Al2O3 catalysts in this work and for other cobalt catalysts are very promising and allow concluding that cobalt catalysts are suitable for design an effective catalyst, able to long-term stable work in the steam reforming of ethanol at moderate temperature."
11,Conclusions,"The results presented in this article show that Co-containing catalysts (K-Co-ZnO-Al2O3) allow high hydrogen yields in the SRM as well as in the SRE. All examined catalysts are able to reform either methanol or ethanol under comparable conditions (420–450°C). Promotion with potassium acts beneficially on the performance of catalysts in the SRE as well as on selectivity of the SRM processes. The catalysts modified with potassium are more active and more selective in the ethanol steam reforming, especially when it is deposited on the catalyst surface with smaller cobalt active phase crystallites (prepared by the co-precipitation). Smaller cobalt particles together with potassium addition allowed also for suppressing carbonaceous deposit formation. Such catalysts are easier reducible than those obtained by the citrate method. According to obtained catalytic data the best catalysts for both the SRM and SRE process is the K-Co-ZnO-Al2O3 catalyst (~28wt% Co+2wt% K, prepared by the co-precipitation method). Such cobalt-based potassium-promoted catalyst can be applied for on-site production of hydrogen-rich gas from alternatively methanol or/and ethanol used as a feed in small generators for fuel cell applications."
