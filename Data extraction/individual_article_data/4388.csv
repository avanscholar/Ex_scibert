0,Introduction,"The properties of the surfaces and interfaces of the catalysts play an important role in determining their catalytic performance, selectivity and stability in the field of heterogeneous catalysis [1–7]. Recently, interfacial synergy effects in nanosystems have been extensively investigated, with available reports on metal/metal oxide [8], metal/metal hydroxide [9] and metal/metal [10,11] interfaces. A large number of reports concerning the interfacial effect in heterogeneous catalytic oxidation reactions are available and some important theoretical achievements have been obtained [12]. However, only a small fraction of research works reported such effects in heterogeneous hydrogenation reactions and detailed mechanistic insights still require additional in-depth studies. For the above three types of interfaces, metal/metal oxide interfaces are most widely involved and investigated in heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenations. Researchers mainly exploited DFT theoretical calculations, model catalysis under ultra-vacuum conditions as well as in-situ characterization techniques (e.g. in-situ spectroscopy, XRD, TEM, XAS, XPS and neutron scattering) to investigate the interface effect mechanism and its influence on catalytic hydrogenation performance [13–15]. As an example of the metal/metal oxide system, Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 was a typical and common catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. Studies proved a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between Cu and ZnO, resulting in the formation of CuZn alloy species at the interface between Cu and ZnO. Zn atoms at the edge of Cu step were actual active sites in the catalytic reaction, with methanol yields increasing at higher Zn coverage [16,17]. In addition, Pd/Al2O3 (SiO2, TiO2, CeO2, Ga2O3, MgO or ZnO) catalysts were also extensively employed in the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol; similarly, the interface interaction between Pd and the metal oxide directly affected CO2 conversion and methanol selectivity [18]. For metal/metal hydroxide interfaces, Markovic et al. [19] investigated Pt/Ni(OH)2 interface effects, finding an 8 times superior catalytic activity for Ni(OH)2/Pt islands/Pt(111) as compared to Pt(111) in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The existence of small Pt islands was found to be advantageous in the formation of Pt/Ni(OH)2 interfaces. The interfacial effect mechanism included a sequential water adsorption and activation on Ni(OH)2 sites (dissociated OH adsorbed on the surface of Ni(OH)2), followed by the reaction with generated-H on Pt sites to form H2. In our previous work, we designed Ru/Ni/Ni(OH)2/C catalysts, which exhibited excellent catalytic performance for aromatics hydrogenation due to the synergistic effects observed between Ru, Ni and Ni(OH)2 [20]. Metal/metal hydroxide interface effects have been seldom investigated in heterogeneous hydrogenation reactions. For the metal/metal interfaces, the addition of metal to metal to form bimetallic catalysts (especially the addition of transition metals to noble metals) can not only significantly improve its catalytic performance in terms of activity, selectivity and stability but also reduce its cost. Sykes and his co-workers [21] designed single atomic Pd1/Cu(111) bimetallic interfaces and found that H2 was selectively adsorbed and activated on Pd, dissociating into H atoms and then overflowing to the Cu surface. H reacted with the activated substrate (styrene or acetylene) on Cu sites, forming hydrogenated products. They also developed a practical, efficient and stable Pt/Cu single-atom alloys catalyst for C-H activation [11]. Herein, two layer-structure systems (transition metal/carbon nanotubes) were prepared as support to load tiny nanoclusters islands of noble metals (e.g., rhodium) to design Rh/Ni/CNTs, Rh/Co/CNTs and Rh/NiCo/CNTs, with the purpose of obtaining improved dispersions of the precious metal and generating abundant metal/metal interfaces. An array of analytical techniques including XRD, XPS, TEM, HRTEM, HS-LEIS, STEM-EDX elemental maps and line profiles, STEM (Titan G2 60-300 spherical aberration correction transmission), XANES and EXAFS confirmed that the unique nanostructure of Rh tiny island-on-Ni (Co or NiCo) nanoparticle was present in all designed systems. Using tetralin hydrogenation as probe reaction, XAS and in-situ XAS (in hydrogen at 35 °C or 100 °C) spectra of as-prepared catalysts proved stable nanostructures, chemical states of different elements and interfacial effects of Rh, Ni (Co or NiCo) present during the reaction process. Rh/NiCo/CNTs exhibited remarkable catalytic hydrogenation performance due to the observed Rh, Ni and Co interfacial synergy effect."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Catalyst support (carbon nanotubes-CNTs) was purchased from Shenzhen Nanotech Port Co., Ltd. Cabot Corporation. Tetralin, decalin, anhydrous rhodium chloride (RhCl3), nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O), cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O), anhydrous ethanol, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), 85 wt% (weight percent) hydrazine hydrate solution, n-hexane (internal standard for gas chromatography (GC) analysis) with analytic grade were purchased from Aladdin. Reagents were not further purified prior to use."
3,Preparation of catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of catalysts Fresh carbon nanotubes were firstly treated in concentrated nitric acid at 110 °C for 4 h to remove potential trace metals present in the preparation of carbon nanotubes (e.g., nickel). Carbon nanotubes-supported nickel (Ni/CNTs), carbon nanotubes-supported cobalt (Co/CNTs), carbon nanotubes-supported nickel-cobalt (NiCo/CNTs) were prepared at RT via hydrazine hydrate reduction [22–24]. For NiCo/CNTs as example, typically, 1.25 g CNTs was dispersed in the mixture liquid of 82.5 mL aqueous NiCl2·6H2O (0.625 g) and CoCl2·6H2O (0.625 g) solution and 12.5 mL anhydrous ethanol (the mole ratio of Ni2+:Co2+ = 1:1), under magnetic stirring for 10 min. 12.5 mL of aqueous NaOH solution (with 1.813 g NaOH) was added into the above solution to adjust its pH. 25 mL hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O, 85 wt%) as reducing agent was placed into the above liquid after ten minutes. Subsequently, the as-obtained mixture was transferred into a Teflon cup, magnetic agitation at RT for 18 h. After that, the liquid was filtered, washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol several times. The black solid powder was obtained after being dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 6 h, denoted as NiCo/CNTs∼uncalcined. The NiCo/CNTs sample was obtained after being reduced in hydrogen (99.999 %) at 380 °C for 3 h. Ni/CNTs∼uncalcined and Co/CNTs∼uncalcined catalysts were synthesized via the same steps as the preparation of NiCo/CNTs∼uncalcined except that the precursor solution was aqueous CoCl2·6H2O (1.35 g) or NiCl2·6H2O (1.35 g) solution, where the amount of Ni2+ or Co2+ was equal to that of Ni2++Co2+ in the synthesis of NiCo/CNTs∼uncalcined. Total Ni and Co element loading in NiCo/CNTs∼uncalcined and NiCo/CNTs was 6.8 wt% and 6.6 wt%, and the Ni/CNTs∼uncalcined and Ni/CNTs (or Co/CNTs∼uncalcined and Co/CNTs) catalysts with 13.6 wt% Ni (or 13.4 wt% Co) content, respectively, determined by ICP-MS (Agilent 7700 ICP-MS). Rh/Ni, Rh/Co and Rh/NiCo catalysts were synthesized by galvanic replacement reaction [25–28]. 12 mL aqueous RhCl3 solution (with the concentration of 1 g RhCl3/500 mL H2O) was added into 0.3 g NiCo/CNTs, and it was kept at RT for 6 h under magnetic stirring. Then the catalysts were collected by filtration, thoroughly washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 6 h, signed as Rh/NiCo/CNTs∼uncalcined. The preparation details of Rh/Ni/CNTs∼uncalcined and Rh/Co/CNTs∼uncalcined were identical with those of Rh/NiCo/CNTs∼uncalcined. Rh/CNTs was synthesized by an incipient wetness impregnation method and annealed in hydrogen at 380 °C for 3 h. Rh/NiCo/CNTs∼uncalcined, Rh/Ni/CNTs∼uncalcined, Rh/Co/CNTs∼uncalcined were also reduced in hydrogen at 380 °C for 3 h, denoted as Rh/NiCo/CNTs, Rh/Ni/CNTs and Rh/Co/CNTs, respectively. Rh loading in the catalysts containing Rh was 2.66 wt%, obtained by ICP-MS technique, and Rh/Ni/CNTs with 10.4 wt% Ni, Rh/Co/CNTs with 10.4 wt% Co and Rh/NiCo/CNTs with 5.2 wt% Ni and 5.0 wt% Co."
4,Materials characterization,"2.3 Materials characterization Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer was used for powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of the catalysts. It contained a high-speed array detection system, and Cu Ka radiation (40 kV, 30 mA, λ =0.15406 nm) was used as the X-ray source. The scanning two theta was from 10° to 90°. The scanning speed was 10° min−1. The powder sample was put in the groove in the quartz flake, then flattening. PHI Quantum 2000 Scanning ESCA Microprobe was used for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) tests of the catalysts, with monochromatic Al Ka (1486.6 eV) as radiation. The XPSPEAK41 soft was used to obtain XPS fitting results on the basis of referring the Handbook of X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-angle annular dark field scanning-transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) observations, elemental energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) line-scanning and mapping were performed using a FEI TECNAI F30 microscope, operating at 300 kV. When performing EDX, the sample was tilted 15 degrees in the α direction. Atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM images of the samples were obtained using a Titan G2 60–300 aberration-corrected microscope operating at 300 kV. The beam convergence half-angle was 25 mrad, and the inner and outer collection half-angles of the HAADF detector were about 60 and 290 mrad. Prior to TEM tests, several drops of the ethanol suspension with the black solid powder (sample) were dripped onto a copper grid coated with carbon film. The solvent was then evaporated under ambient conditions. IonTOF Qtac100 low-energy ion scattering analyzer was used to record the high-sensitivity low-energy ion scattering (HS-LEIS) spectra of the samples, with the scattering angle of 145°. 4He+ ion beam with a kinetic energy of 3 keV and a flux of 1325 pA cm−2 was used to collect the 4He+ HS-LEIS spectra. 20Ne+ ion beam with a kinetic energy of 5 keV and a low flux of 1600 pA cm−2 was used for gaining 20Ne+ HS-LEIS spectra. Ni K-edge, Co K-edge and Rh L-edge XAS (including X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra (EXAFS)) measurements of the samples were conducted using a SXRMB beamline at the Canadian Light Source, Saskatoon, Canada. For ex-situ measurements, a thin layer of powder sample was spread on the conducting, double-sided carbon tape and loaded into the vacuum chamber. The total electron yield spectrum was measured by recoding the sample drain current and a 4-element Si (Li) drift detector was used for fluorescence measurement. In-situ XAS spectra were acquired with sample loaded in an in-situ cell and the sample was reduced in hydrogen (99.999 %) at 35 °C and 100 °C. Transmission and fluorescence yields were used for the in-situ XAS measurements. We processed X-ray absorption data by using Athena package [29]. The XAS spectra of Ni foil, NiO, Ni(OH)2, Co foil, CoO, Co3O4, Rh foil, Rh2O3 and RhO4 powder were used as experimental references."
5,Catalytic experiments,"2.4 Catalytic experiments Tetralin hydrogenation reaction was carried out in a 300 mL autoclave with mechanical stirring equipment (Parr 4848). Firstly, 0.05 g catalyst and 10 mL tetralin were introduced into the reactor, and then the autoclave was installed. Secondly, the reactor was purged with N2 and H2 for several times, respectively. After that, the reactor was charged with 5.0 MPa static H2 atmosphere (initial pressure). Thirdly, the reaction liquid was quickly heated to the desired reaction temperature (such as 100 °C, or 30 °C), and the whole reaction was maintained for certain reaction time at the stirring speed of 500 rpm. Finally, the autoclave was quickly cooled to 5 °C by using ice-water bath and the residual hydrogen was evacuated. The resulting liquid was obtained by centrifugation. The hydrogenated products were analyzed by Agilent GC 7820A gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a DB-35 60 m × 0.32 mm capillary column. The products were identified by using Agilent GC–MS 7890B 5977 gas chromatography∼mass spectrometry. The catalytic activity of the catalysts was evaluated by calculating the rate of tetralin hydrogenation (r) according to the equation below, which was in a good agreement with the calculation process of Pt mass specific CO oxidation rates of the PtNiCo/C catalysts in Ref. [30]: r = n conversion of tetralin / (n total rhodium×t) In the formula, n conversion of tetralin , t and n total rhodium represented moles of conversing tetralin, reaction time (h) and total moles of rhodium in the catalysts, respectively. The unit of r is moltetralin molRh −1 h−1."
6,Results and discussions,
7,Catalysts characterization,"3.1 Catalysts characterization Powder X-ray diffraction measurements for as-prepared catalysts were performed to investigate crystalline and nanostructural changes before/after the hydrogen reduction step. Fig. S1 shows XRD patterns of Ni/CNTs∼uncalcined, Rh/Ni/CNTs∼uncalcined, Rh/Co/CNTs∼uncalcined, Rh/Ni/CNTs, Rh/Co/CNTs and Co/CNTs∼uncalcined catalysts. The diffraction peak located at about 26° can be attributed to (002) facets of graphite (JCPDS card No. 75-1621) [31,32]. As displayed in Fig. S1A, the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 44.5°, 51.8° and 76.4° can be indexed as Ni(111), Ni(200) and Ni(220) planes (JCPDS card No. 04-0850) [33]. The weak peak at ca. 19.1° was assigned to Ni(OH)2(001) (JCPDS card No. 14-0117) [34,35]. The diffraction peak at two theta of ca. 43° can be ascribed to NiO(200) (JCPDS card No. 47-1049) [36,37]. The presence of Ni(OH)2 can be due to Ni2+ ions reacting with OH− ions in the initial period of the catalyst synthesis. A small amount of NiO crystallite phase was mainly resulted from the oxidation of Ni NPs exposed in air for a long time prior to XRD tests. The diffraction peaks were ascribed to nickel hydroxide, while nickel oxide disappeared after Rh/Ni/CNTs∼uncalcined was annealed under hydrogen atmosphere. Only the diffraction peaks of carbon nanotubes and reduced state nickel could be observed. The intensity of these peaks become higher but the full-width at half-maximum gets smaller, pointing to larger NP sizes after hydrogen reduction. In addition, 2θ diffraction peaks of Ni in the XRD patterns of Rh/Ni/CNTs do not shifted as compared to Rh/Ni/CNTs∼uncalcined, while corresponding Rh diffraction peaks are absent, suggesting a fine Rh distribution on Ni NPs. Fig. S1B displays XRD patterns of Co/CNTs∼uncalcined, Rh/Co/CNTs∼uncalcined and Rh/Co/CNTs samples. XRD patterns of Co/CNTs∼uncalcined and Rh/Co/CNTs∼uncalcined show the characteristic of Co(OH)2 crystallite phase (2θ = 19.1°, 38.1° and 51.4°, indexed as Co(OH)2(001), Co(OH)2(101) and Co(OH)2(102) planes (JCPDS card No. 30-0443)) [38]. There are diffraction peaks attributable to CNTs and Co3O4 crystallite phase in the XRD patterns of Rh/Co/CNTs, 26°-carbon(002), 19.0°-Co3O4(111), 31.3°-Co3O4(220), 36.9°-Co3O4(311), 38.5°-Co3O4(222), 44.8°-Co3O4(400) and 65.2°-Co3O4(440) (JCPDS card No. 42-1467) [39]. No diffraction peak assigned to Rh can be seen, indicating that Rh is highly dispersed on Co3O4 NPs and then on CNTs. XRD patterns of Rh/CNTs, NiCo/CNTs∼uncalcined, NiCo/CNTs, Rh/NiCo/CNTs∼uncalcined and Rh/NiCo/CNTs are present in Fig. S2. In Fig. S2Aa (Rh/CNTs), six main diffraction peaks can be observed at 26°, 43° and 53° corresponding to CNTs (JCPDS card No. 75-1621) [40], and the peaks at 2θ = 41.1°, 47.8° and 69.9° are attributable to Rh(111), Rh(200) and Rh(220) planes, respectively (JCPDS card No. 05-0685) [41]. There are only four diffraction peaks of 26°-CNTs, 44.4°, 51.7° and 76.1° in the XRD patterns of NiCo/CNTs∼uncalcined and NiCo/CNTs (Fig. S2Ab, c). XRD patterns belonging to Ni(OH)2 can be observed only for Rh/NiCo/CNTs∼uncalcined. The diffraction peak with 2θ-44.4° between 44.2°-Co(111) and 44.5-Ni(111) can be ascribed to NiCo alloy(111), 2θ-51.7° between 51.5-Co(200) and 51.8°-Ni(200) assigned to NiCo alloy(200), and 2θ-76.1° between 75.9°-Co(220) and 76.4°-Ni(220) attributed to NiCo alloy(220) (JCPDS card No. 04-0850 and 15-0806). The above results support the formation of NiCo alloy species before and after the hydrogen reduction step of NiCo/CNTs∼uncalcined. Even though Rh is loaded on NiCo NPs, there are also no Rh-related diffraction peaks (Fig. S2Ad, e). The presence of NiCo alloy can be found, suggesting high dispersion of Rh supported on NiCo NPs, likely in the form of Rh single atoms or nanoclusters. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) tests were performed to analyze the chemical states of each element, compositions of different species and electron interaction among various elements. Fig. S3 depicts the Rh 3d, Ni 2p and Co 2p XPS spectra of the Rh/Ni/CNTs and Rh/Co/CNTs catalysts. In the Rh 3d5/2 line, the peaks with the binding energies at approximately 307.4 eV (Rh 3d3/2-312.15 eV), 308.4 eV (Rh 3d3/2-313.15 eV) and 310 eV (Rh 3d3/2-314.75 eV) are attributed to the presence of reduced rhodium species (Rh(0)) and oxidation state rhodium (Rh+ and Rh3+), respectively (Fig. S3a and c) [42,43]. For Rh/Ni/CNTs, the peaks at binding energies of 852.7 eV (Ni 2p3/2) and 870 eV (Ni 2p1/2) can be assigned to Ni(0), those at 853.9 eV (Ni 2p3/2) and 871.2 eV (Ni 2p1/2) corresponding to NiO, those at 855.4 eV (2p3/2) and 872.9 eV (2p1/2) belonging to Ni(OH)2 species, and those at 857.1 eV (2p3/2) and 874.4 eV (2p1/2) attributable to NiOOH, respectively (Fig. S3b) [44,45]. There are three obvious fitting peaks at binding energies of ca.778.2 eV, 780.2 eV and 781.1 eV in Co 2p3/2, corresponding to Co(0), CoO and Co(OH)2 species, respectively. Another three peaks at 793.4 eV (Co(0)), 795.4 eV (CoO) and 796.3 eV (Co(OH)2) can be obviously found in Co 2p1/2 (Fig. S3d) [46,47]. The peaks labeled ‘shake up’ are due to satellite peaks [44–47]. Fig. S4 depicts Rh 3d XPS spectra of Rh/CNTs and Rh/NiCo/CNTs as well as Ni 2p and Co 2p XPS spectra of Rh/NiCo/CNTs. It can be found that there is no shift in the binding energies of different surface Ni species (Co or Rh) in various samples, suggesting that there is no obvious electron transfer between Rh and Ni (or Co) element, further indicating not Rh/Ni (Rh/Co or Rh/NiCo) alloy but Rh/Ni (Rh/Co or Rh/NiCo) phase segregation present in these catalysts. This finding agrees well with results from XRD characterization, which can be also confirmed through other XPS results shown in Fig. S5–11. According to Rh XPS results (Fig. S5–9), the ratio of Rh(0)/Rhn+ on the surface of Rh/CNTs is much higher than that of Rh/Ni/CNTs (Rh/Co/CNTs or Rh/NiCo/CNTs). This is because Rh islands (single atoms or nanoclusters) are comparatively better dispersed in Rh/Ni/CNTs (Rh/Co/CNTs or Rh/NiCo/CNTs) than those in Rh/CNTs, resulting in Rh on the surface easily being oxidized under air. Ni or Co oxide species are dominant in all Ni or Co-containing catalysts due to surface being oxidized after catalysts exposure under air. TEM images and metallic NPs size distribution for bimetallic or trimetallic catalysts show that metallic NPs are deposited on carbon nanotubes (Fig. S12–14). HRTEM images for Rh/CNTs, Rh/Ni/CNTs, Rh/Co/CNTs and Rh/NiCo/CNTs are present in Fig. S15. Fig. S15a shows a typical HRTEM image for Rh/CNTs. Based on the calculation of the interplanar distance of the lattice fringe and its corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns results, Rh(111) facets are present in this material [48], indicating that Rh NPs were successfully supported on carbon nanotubes. The obvious lattice fringe with interplanar distance of 0.203 nm present in Fig. S15b corresponds to (111) planes of face-centered cubic (fcc) nickel structures [49], but no lattice fringe consistent with metallic Rh or rhodium oxide could be found in the HRTEM images of Rh/Ni/CNTs. These results confirm that Rh is loaded on Ni NPs. In Fig. S15c, the distance of 0.244 nm can be ascribed to the lattice fringe spacing of Co3O4(311) planes [50], also without observation of the lattice fringe of Rh(0) or Rh oxides. Only NiCo alloy(111) phases (interplanar distance-0.203 nm) could be identified (Fig. S15d), also revealed by FFT patterns results, all pointing to Rh in the form of single atoms or tiny nanoclusters supported on NiCo alloy NPs. These HRTEM results are in line with other characterization results shown above. The microstructure and elemental distribution of Rh/Ni/C were studied using HAADF-STEM observations, in combination with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy measurements. Fig. 1 a is a high-resolution HAADF-STEM image of the Rh/Ni/C catalyst, showing the presence of fine particles several nm in diameters adhered to or overlapped on large irregular particles. The fine bright particles show the lattice spacings of 1.9 Å and 2.2 Å, corresponding to the (020), (002) and (111) crystal planes of cubic phase Rh, as indicated in Fig. 1a. The lattice spacing of 1.2 Å corresponds to the (220) crystal plane of cubic phase Ni, consistent with Ni observed by XRD shown in Fig. S1A. The high-resolution results show that tiny Rh NPs stick to Ni particles. The co-existence of Rh and Ni was also confirmed by EDX mapping, as shown in Fig. 1b–d. The signal of Ni is comparatively much stronger than that of Rh, as shown in Fig. 1c and d, which suggests that few Rh NPs are attached to larger Ni particles. Fig. 2 a shows a high-resolution HAADF-STEM image of Rh/Co/CNTs. In Fig. 2a, there is a nanoparticle showing a lattice spacing of 2.7 Å for two families of crystal planes, consistent with (110) and (011) crystal planes of cubic phase Rh. In addition, there are regions showing lattice spacings of 2.2 Å and 2.0 Å corresponding, respectively, to (321) and (3-2-2) crystal planes of Co3O4 cubic phase. High-resolution HAADF-STEM results indicated the co-existence of Rh NPs and Co3O4 particles in Rh/Co/C, consistent with XRD results shown in Fig. S1B. EDX mapping and line-scanning results for Rh/Co/CNTs point out that the distribution of Rh is not uniform, as shown in Fig. 2b–e. This is consistent with the presence of individual Rh nanoparticles attached to Co3O4 particles, based on high-resolution HAADF-STEM observations shown in Fig. 2a. Fig. 3 a is a high-resolution HAADF-STEM image recorded from a region in the Rh/NiCo/CNTs sample. There are a large number of nano-regions showing one-dimensional lattice fringes and two-dimensional lattice images with a lattice spacing of 2.2 Å, corresponding to the {111} crystal plane family of cubic Rh. This supports the presence of individual Rh particles of several nanometers with different orientations within the region shown in Fig. 3a. Fig. 3b is a low-magnification HAADF-STEM image recorded from Rh/NiCo/CNTs, showing particles attached to carbon nanotubes. Both EDX elemental mapping and line-scanning demonstrated similar distribution of Ni and Co within particles in Rh/NiCo/CNTs, which implied a homogeneous distribution of both elements, as shown in Fig. 3c and d. Comparably, the distribution of Rh species is not uniform as shown in Fig. 3e and f. This is consistent with high-resolution HAADF-STEM observation of individual Rh nanoparticles on larger particles (as shown in Fig. 3a). High-sensitivity low-energy ion scattering (HS-LEIS) measurements for all catalysts were performed to detect the atomic composition on their outmost surface. Although the 3 keV 4He+ HS-LEIS spectra can provide the signal of all elements, they are less sensitive to heavy elements. Fig. 4 displays both 3 keV 4He+ HS-LEIS and 5 keV 20Ne+ HS-LEIS spectra of the catalysts. It can be found that Rh, Ni and Co co-exist (Rh and Ni, Rh and Co) on the outmost surface of Rh/NiCo/CNTs (Rh/Ni/CNTs, Rh/Co/CNTs). The proportion of Rh atoms: Ni atoms (Co atoms or Ni + Co atoms) signals intensity on the outer surface of different samples is approximately similar despite the intensity difference for diverse catalysts. Integrating the above characterization results, it is further demonstrated that Rh forming tiny islands is deposited on the surface of NiCo alloy (Ni or Co) NPs. Normalized XANES spectra of the Ni K-edge, as well as in-situ Ni K-edge XANES spectra of as-synthesized samples (NiCo/CNTs-uncalcined, NiCo/CNTs, Rh/CNTs, Rh/Ni/CNTs, and Rh/NiCo/CNTs) as well as Ni foil, NiO, Ni(OH)2 references are shown in Fig. 5 . The intensity of the white line for as-obtained catalysts is located between that of Ni foil and NiO or Ni(OH)2 powder, approaching that of Ni foil (Fig. 5A). The order of their intensity is found to be NiCo/CNTs-uncalcined > NiCo/CNTs > Rh/Ni/CNTs ≈ Rh/NiCo/CNTs, indicating that zero-valent nickel is dominant as compared to nickel oxides/hydroxides (NiO or Ni(OH)2). The ratio of Ni(0)/Ni2+ in NiCo/CNTs, Rh/Ni/CNTs and Rh/NiCo/CNTs samples was much larger than that of NiCo/CNTs-uncalcined as the former catalysts were reduced in H2 at 380 °C during the catalysts preparation process. The amount of Ni(0) increased with temperature from 35 °C to 100 °C (Fig. 5B). For NiCo/CNTs, at both 35 °C and 100 °C, all Ni was found to be present as Ni(0) (Fig. 5C). The content of Ni(0) in Rh/Ni/CNTs-H2-100 is larger than that in Rh/Ni/CNTs-H2-35, and Ni element in Rh/Ni/CNTs-H2-100 is entirely in the form of Ni(0) (Fig. 5D). However, for both Rh/NiCo/CNTs-H2-35 and Rh/NiCo/CNTs-H2-100, some Ni(II) species were observed probably due to the influence of cobalt species (Fig. 5E). The above results suggest that most nickel in as-prepared catalysts after being reduced at 380 °C is mainly present in the metallic state during the hydrogenation reaction process. This conclusion is very consistent with related characterization results, revealing the nanostructure of Rh-on-Ni and Rh-on-NiCo in Rh/Ni/CNTs and Rh/NiCo/CNTs, respectively. Fig. 6 shows the comparison results of normal and in-situ XANES spectra at the Co K-edge of NiCo/CNTs-uncalcined, NiCo/CNTs, Rh/Co/CNTs and Rh/NiCo/CNTs, and the XANES results of Co foil, CoO, Co3O4 as references. The white line of Rh/Co/CNTs is located between that of CoO and that of Co3O4 powder, closer to Co3O4, indicating the presence of Co3O4 in Rh/Co/CNTs (Fig. 6A). All samples containing cobalt shows the presence of oxidized cobalt species. The proportion of metallic cobalt in all cobalt species follows the below order: Rh/NiCo/CNTs ≈ NiCo/CNTs > NiCo/CNTs-uncalcined > Rh/Co/CNTs. Most cobalt atoms are present in the form of Co(0) in Rh/NiCo/CNTs and NiCo/CNTs relative to other samples. It implied that nickel zerovalent atoms (Ni(0)) improved the reduction of Con+ during the process of thermal-treatment in hydrogen. As depicted in Fig. 6B, the in-situ XANES spectra of NiCo/CNTs-uncalcined at 35 °C and 100 °C confirmed that high temperatures are advantageous for the reduction of cobalt oxide species. With regards to NiCo/CNTs, Rh/Co/CNTs and Rh/NiCo/CNTs (Fig. 6C–E), a large amount of oxidized cobalt species (Con+) could be reduced during hydrogenation conditions in this work, particularly improved in the presence of nickel. Therefore, the proportion of oxidized cobalt species is the smallest in Rh/NiCo/CNTs among as-synthesized samples under hydrogenation reaction conditions (as shown in Table 1 ). XAS data further pointed out that the nanostructure in Rh/Co/CNTs and Rh/NiCo/CNTs is Rh-on-Co3O4 and Rh-on-NiCo, respectively. Fig. 7 depicts ex-situ and operando (35 °C and 100 °C in hydrogen) Rh L-edge XANES spectra of Rh/CNTs, Rh/Ni/CNTs, Rh/Co/CNTs and Rh/NiCo/CNTs, in addition to Rh foil, Rh2O3, RhO4 references. The energy of the white line of as-prepared catalysts is higher than that of Rh foil, demonstrating that oxidized rhodium species (Rhn+) exist in these catalysts. The changing trend and shape of XANES spectra of Rh/CNTs, Rh/Ni/CNTs, Rh/Co/CNTs and Rh/NiCo/CNTs are similar, but the intensity of their white line follow the order: Rh/Ni/CNTs > Rh/Co/CNTs > Rh/NiCo/CNTs > Rh/CNTs, indicating that the quantity of Rhn+ in Rh/Ni/CNTs is the largest (or that there is much more d-band vacancy in Rh/Ni/CNTs than other samples due to the absorption peak originating from electron transferring from 2p to 4d orbital). The intensity of the white line and the shape of XANES spectra of Rh/Co/CNTs are nearly identical to those of Rh2O3, indicating the dominance of Rh2O3 in Rh/Co/CNTs (Fig. 7A). All Rhn+ species could be reduced to metallic Rh (Rh(0)) when Rh/CNTs was reduced under hydrogen at 35 °C or 100 °C (Fig. 7B). The white-line intensity in Rh/CNTs-100 is lower than that in Rh/CNTs-35 and Rh foil, because much more electrons transfer from CNTs to the 5d orbital of Rh owing to much higher temperature. Even though most Rhn+ species have been reduced under hydrogen at 35 °C or 100 °C, a small amount of Rhn+ is still present (Fig. 7C). Much more Rhn+ (all Rhn+) were reduced to metallic Rh under hydrogen at 100 °C (hydrogenation reaction temperature) for Rh/Co/CNTs and Rh/NiCo/CNTs than Rh/Ni/CNTs probably because of higher Rh dispersion in Rh/Ni/CNTs and stronger interaction between Rh and Ni, the reason of the high activity observed for Rh/Co/CNTs and Rh/NiCo/CNTs at 100 °C (in hydrogen) as compared to other systems (as shown in Table 1). Interestingly, we also found that a small amount of oxidized Ni or Co species could improve the catalytic hydrogenation activity. Normal and in-situ Fourier-transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra are given in Fig. 8 . The features, scattering paths and their distance (R) in the EXAFS spectra of NiCo/CNTs, Rh/Ni/CNTs, and Rh/NiCo/CNTs are very similar to those of Ni foil, except for NiCo/CNTs-uncalcined. It implies that the local coordination environment is almost same as that of Ni foil, further suggesting no Rh-Co (or Rh-Ni) alloy forming in these catalysts. A prominent peak at about 2.25 À can be assigned to Ni-Ni contribution. The intensity of Fourier transform peaks is in accord with the order of NiCo/CNTs ≈ Rh/Ni/CNTs > Rh/NiCo/CNTs > NiCo/CNTs-uncalcined, indicating that the size of nickel-related particles in NiCo/CNTs-uncalcined is smallest. Additionally, we can also find a small peak at about 1.4 Å for the samples, which is from first shell of Ni-O (Fig. 8A). As shown in Fig. 8B, the coordination number (CN) of Ni-Ni bonding (first shell, ～2.25 Å) obviously increased when materials were measured under reaction conditions (in H2 at 35 °C or 100 °C), but CN of Ni-O bonding (first shell, ～1.4 Å) obviously decreased owing to the reduction effect of hydrogen. The similar conclusions could also be obtained by analyzing the EXAFS spectra of NiCo/CNTs, Rh/Ni/CNTs and Rh/NiCo/CNTs in hydrogen at 35 °C or 100 °C (Fig. 8C-E). The above results confirm that Rh-on-Ni nanoparticle (Rh-on-NiCo alloy nanoparticle) is dominant in Rh/Ni/CNTs (Rh/NiCo/CNTs) both before/during the hydrogenation reaction. Co K-edge EXAFS spectra of samples containing cobalt element are displayed in Fig. 9 . The Co K-edge EXAFS of the Rh/Co/CNTs sample is clearly different from those of Co foil, but is very close to those of CoO and Co3O4. But the EXAFS results of NiCo/CNTs-uncalcined, NiCo/CNTs and Rh/NiCo/CNTs approach to those of Co foil. The atomic distance (R) of 2.2 Å represents Co-Co bonding and 1.4 Å shows Co-O bonding. The intensity of the peak of Co-Co contribution is relatively large for NiCo/CNTs-uncalcined, NiCo/CNTs and Rh/NiCo/CNTs, but the peak of Co-O contribution is most obvious for Rh/Co/CNTs. It further reveals that Co mainly as zerovalent species (Co(0)) exist in the catalysts simultaneously containing Co and Ni, while Co3O4 species are mainly present in Rh/Co/CNTs (Fig. 9A). During the hydrogenation reaction process (Fig. 9B, C, E), CN of Co-Co bonds would be increased but that of Co-O would be decreased for catalysts containing both Co and Ni (with Ni(0) improving the reduction of Con+ species). The contribution of Co-Co bonding (～2.2 Å) became greater when the temperature of hydrogenation reaction increased from 35 °C to 100 °C, pointing to the reduction of most oxidized cobalt species (Con+) to Co(0) at 100 °C (Fig. 9D). A model pictorial scheme of the catalysts including phases and nanostructures has been depicted in Figs. 5–9F. In Fig. 5F, the co-existence of Ni(0) (Co(0)) and Ni2+ (Con+) is present in NiCo/CNTs-uncalcined. Most oxidized nickel and cobalt species were reduced in H2 at 35 °C and 100 °C, only a small amount of Ni2+ (Con+) species remained. High temperature (100 °C) could easily improve the reduction of all oxidized species. But for NiCo/CNTs, all Ni2+ were reduced in H2 at both 35 °C and 100 °C, while some Con+ species were still present (Fig. 6F). All Ni species were present in the form of Ni(0), however, no Rhn+ species were found when the hydrogenation reaction was carried out at 100 °C over Rh/Ni/CNTs. The presence of some oxidized Ni and Rh species could be observed in Rh/Ni/CNTs under reduction conditions at 35 °C (Fig. 7F). Oxidized cobalt species were relatively abundant, but the absence of Rhn+ species was distinct for Rh/Co/CNTs in H2 at 35 °C and 100 °C (Fig. 8F), due to a lower dispersion of Rh on Co3O4 as compared to that for Rh on Ni in Rh/Ni/CNTs. Additionally, a relatively weak interaction was present between Rh and Co3O4, while it was comparably stronger between Rh and Ni (that prevented some Rhn+ species from being reduced at 35 °C). These facts explained that a small fraction of Rhn+ species were still present in Rh/NiCo/CNTs being reduced in H2 at 35 °C. Comparably, all rhodium was present as Rh(0) (with little Ni2+ and Con+ species) for Rh/NiCo/CNTs being reduced in hydrogen at 100 °C (Fig. 9F). Based on the reported references [51,52], the oxidation state of noble metal (such as PtOx, RuOx) could be reduced to reduction state (Pt(0), Ru(0)) under mild conditions (for example at low temperature, even at room temperature), and then Pt(0) (or Ru(0)) would improve the reduction of PtOx (or RuOx). So the reduction temperature of NiOx and CoOx would decrease after Rh was supported on NiCo surface by the activation of hydrogen at Rh sites and hydrogen spillover effect, which were in good agreement with the in-situ XAS results. Combining with the above characterization results, especially for the normal and in-situ XANES and EXAFS spectra, it revealed that Rh/NiCo/CNTs owned the nanostructure of Rh-on-NiCo alloy NP and Rh(0) as well as NiCo(0) were reactive active sites during tetralin hydrogenation reaction. It fully proved that Rh(0) were key active sites for adsorbing and activating hydrogen, then forming activated hydrogen species (H*), then H* was transferred to the surface of Ni (Co) related species by “hydrogen spillover effect”, it largely improved the reduction of Nin+ and Con+, forming Ni(0) (Co(0)); the hydrogenated substrate (e.g., tetralin) was adsorbed and activated at the NiCo (zerovalent) sites, reacting with H* to produce decalin."
8,Catalytic performance of as-prepared catalysts for tetralin hydrogenation,"3.2 Catalytic performance of as-prepared catalysts for tetralin hydrogenation In order to compare the catalytic hydrogenation performance of monometallic, bimetallic and trimetallic nanocatalysts, the hydrogenation of tetralin was selected as probe reaction (Table 1). All catalysts provided 100 % selectivity to decalin under identical reaction conditions (as shown in the bottom of Table 1, reaction parameters: tetralin-10 mL, catalyst-0.05 g, initial H2 pressure-5.0 MPa, reaction temperature-100 °C, reaction time-1 h). Both bimetallic nanocatalysts (NiCo/CNTs∼uncalcined and NiCo/CNTs) and monometallic nanocatalysts (Ni/CNTs∼uncalcined and Co/CNTs∼uncalcined) prior to supporting Rh showed almost no catalytic activity (entries 1–4 in Table 1). The yield to decalin was 1.5 % when the hydrogenation of tetralin was performed over the Rh/CNTs catalyst within 1 h, with r of 112.5 moltetralin molRh −1 h−1. By comparing the catalytic properties of calcined and uncalcined catalysts (Table 1 entries 5–10) including Rh/NiCo/CNTs∼uncalcined and Rh/NiCo/CNTs, the conversion of tetralin slightly increased after the catalysts were reduced in hydrogen at 380 °C; the reason is that the thermal treatment of the catalysts in hydrogen improved the reduction of oxidized Rh species. 11.5 % of 10 mL tetralin could be hydrogenated to decalin by using Rh/NiCo/CNTs (874.5 moltetralin molRh −1 h−1, Table 1 entry 11). Its catalytic performance was superior to Rh/Ni/CNTs (Table 1 entry 7) and Rh/Co/CNTs (Table 1 entry 9). These results suggested that the interfacial nano-synergy effect of Rh and NiCo could be beneficial to promote tetralin hydrogenation as compared to that of Rh and Ni (Rh and Co). Upon increasing reaction time to 15 h, tetralin could be completely converted to decalin for Rh/NiCo/CNTs, achieving a quantitative yield and r of 380.3 moltetralin molRh −1 h−1 (entry 12 in Table 1). 7.2 % (or 5.7 %) yield to decalin and r of 60.0 (or 47.5) moltetralin molRh −1 h−1 were obtained when the reaction temperature was set at 35 °C (or 25 °C) over Rh/NiCo/CNTs (entries 13, 14 in Table 1), indicating that Rh/NiCo/CNTs catalyst not only provided excellent catalytic performance but also could catalyze solvent-free tetralin hydrogenation at room temperature. Rh/NiCo/CNTs catalyst exhibited higher catalytic activity than the reported catalysts for tetralin hydrogenation under similar reaction conditions [28]. We also investigated the effect of reaction time and temperature on the catalytic performance of the Rh/NiCo/CNTs catalyst for tetralin hydrogenation, the results are given in Fig. 10 . It could be found that the yield to decalin gradually increased from 11.5 % (1 h) to 99.0 % (20 h) (Fig. 10a). But the increasing rate of the yield gradually decreased with the extension of reaction time due to lower and lower concentration of tetralin. The catalytic activity of Rh/NiCo/CNTs obviously enhanced with the increase of reaction temperature (Fig. 10b). To further understand the interfacial nano-synergy effect of Rh, Ni and Co in Rh/NiCo/CNTs for tetralin hydrogenation, based on in-situ XAS results, a synergetic mechanism was proposed in Fig. 11 . Hydrogen activation and dissociation are always most important processes and thus determine reaction rates in hydrogenation reactions [21]. In this study, a strategy of adequately providing tiny Rh nanoclusters (or Rh single atoms) to exclusively adsorb and activate H2 (but not the hydrogenation substrate e.g., tetralin) was provided. Hydrogen was preferentially activated at the tiny Rh sites, forming activated hydrogen species (hydrogen atoms-H*) and spilling over onto the surface of NiCo alloy; tetralin with relatively large size would be only activated at the NiCo sites, then reacting with activated H* species and finally producing decalin. The electron or other interactions between Ni and Co might result in the improvement of the catalytic activity of Rh/NiCo/CNTs relative to Rh/Ni/CNTs or Rh/Co/CNTs."
9,Catalytic stability of Rh/NiCo/CNTs for tetralin hydrogenation,"3.3 Catalytic stability of Rh/NiCo/CNTs for tetralin hydrogenation Apart from examining the catalytic hydrogenation performance of as-obtained catalysts, the stability of typical Rh/NiCo/CNTs was investigated in the hydrogenation of tetralin. The catalyst was recycled by centrifugal separation and reused for next hydrogenation reaction. As shown in Fig. 12 , decalin yields were unchanged after five reaction runs, indicating a high stability of Rh/NiCo/CNTs. In addition to this, ICP-MS experiments of the filtrate (after reaction) showed no metal trace in solution, in good agreement with measured quantities of metal in the fresh catalyst vs five times reused catalyst, again confirming the excellent stability of the designed system."
10,Conclusions,"Carbon nanotubes-supported Rh/Ni, Rh/Co or Rh/NiCo NPs were successfully prepared at room temperature via simple chemical reduction and galvanic replacement reaction. Their novel nanostructures (Rh-on-Ni, Rh-on-Co and Rh-on-NiCo alloy NP) were confirmed by a series of advanced characterization techniques including XRD, XPS, TEM, HRTEM, Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM, EDX-elemental mapping and line-scanning, HS-LEIS, XANES, EXAFS and in-situ XAS. Rh/NiCo/CNTs exhibited a remarkable catalytic performance for tetralin hydrogenation as compared to Rh/CNTs, Rh/Ni/CNTs, Rh/Co/CNTs and Rh/NiCo/CNTs, being able to efficiently catalyze tetralin hydrogenation at room temperature without any reaction solvent. The observed outstanding catalytic activity and stability of Rh/NiCo/CNTs could be attributed to the interfacial nano-synergy effect of Rh, Ni and Co. The proposed mechanism of this effect was proved by in-situ XAS studies in which Rh sites activated H2 → active H* → NiCo alloy sites activated tetralin → reacting → decalin. The proposed studies provide a facile methodology for the design of highly efficient and low-cost multimetallic nanocatalyst for heterogeneous hydrogenation reactions."
