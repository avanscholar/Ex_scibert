0,Introduction,"Glycerol is a major by-product of biodiesel production and is expected to be produced in large excess due to the significant increase in biodiesel production. Since glycerol can be considered as a form of hydrogen chemical storage, a number of researches have focused on hydrogen production from glycerol via steam reforming [1–3], autothermal reforming [4–6], aqueous-phase reforming [7,8] and supercritical water reforming (SCWR) [9,10]. In recent years, SCWR has attracted more and more interest [11–15] due to its high reaction efficiency and H2 selectivity [16]. Because of its unique properties, supercritical water offers higher space-time yield and reduced mass transfer limitations, which improves the performance of endothermic reforming reactions [15,17–19]. Moreover, in SCWR, hydrogen is produced at high pressure, and thus can be stored in high pressure cylinders with much lower energy penalty for compression [13,15,19,20]. On the other hand, a severe problem with this technology is the formation of carbon, which can plug the reactor and pipe lines, in particular during biomass gasification [21,22]. Without addition of catalyst, some studies have investigated the impact of reactor wall materials on the production of a hydrogen rich gases through supercritical water reforming. Yu et al. [23] investigated supercritical water gasification of glucose in Inconel 625 and Hastelloy C276 tubular reactors. 0.1 M of glucose in both reactors were gasified at 600 °C, 34.5 MPa and 30 s residence time without carbon formation; however the results were far from thermochemical equilibrium. Gasification efficiency and yield highly depended on the reactor material and feed concentration of glucose. The Inconel 625 reactor offered higher selectivity toward hydrogen due to enhanced water gas shift reaction, yielding a product gas rich in hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The Hastelloy C276 reactor produced more carbon monoxide and only catalyzed the decomposition of acetic acid after the reactor wall was corroded by a salt solution. Buhler et al. [24] reported that the reforming of glycerol at 349–475 °C, 25–45 MPa, and residence time of 32–165 s in an empty horizontal tubular reactor (no report on the reactor's material was provided) yielded conversions between 0.004 and 0.31. The main products included hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, methanol, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, ethanol, acrolein, and allyl alcohol. They proposed two pathways; one consisting of ionic reactions (higher pressures and/or lower temperatures) and a second one involving free radical degradation (lower pressures and/or higher temperatures). Arita et al. [25] reported that the addition of copper wire promoted ethanol reforming in supercritical water. A stainless steel (SUS 316) reactor exhibited small catalytic activity at 450 °C, compared to a non-catalytic quartz reactor. Boukis et al. [11] reported that Inconel 625 was a promising alloy in supercritical water applications mostly due to its resistance to high temperature and corrosion. Boukis et al. [12] investigated supercritical water gasification of methanol in a tubular Inconel 625 reactor at 400–600 °C, 25–45 MPa without catalyst. Conversion of up to 0.999 was reported, yielding a hydrogen rich gas (up to 75 vol.%) with small fractions of carbon monoxide and methane. Residence times as low as 4 s was enough to achieve high conversion; however, higher reaction temperature (600 °C) would be necessary. Gadhe et al. [13] carried out methanol supercritical water reforming in a tubular Inconel 600 reactor at 700 °C, 276 bar with a particular focus on minimizing methane formation. Favorable conditions were low residence time and high feed methanol concentration. Therdthianwong et al. [26] conducted supercritical water reforming of bioethanol without catalyst in an Inconel 625 reactor. Ethanol conversion of only 0.24 was obtained at 500 °C, 25 MPa and water/ethanol ratio of 20. The main products included hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane. Bennekom et al. [19] performed glycerol reforming at supercritical water conditions (450, 650 °C, residence times of 6–173 s, and 3–20 wt.% of glycerol in feed) in an Incoloy 825 reactor. The results showed that gasification efficiency increased with increasing operating temperature and residence time, but it was nearly independent of the feed concentration. They found that hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, ethylene, and propylene were the primary gas products. The remaining products, including carbon dioxide and propane, were formed due to secondary gas phase reactions. In the case of catalytic supercritical water reforming, Guo et al. [16] distinguished 2 types of catalysts: 1) homogeneous catalysts (alkali metals: Na2CO3, KHCO3, K2CO3, NaOH, etc.) which favor the water gas shift reaction, and 2) heterogeneous catalysts (metal catalysts, such as Ni, Ru, Pt, Pd Rh, Ir, as well as activated carbon catalyst) which offer several advantages such as high selectivity, recyclability and being environmentally friendly. In this paper, glycerol reforming was investigated under supercritical water conditions (450–575 °C, 250 bar) in an Inconel 625 reactor without catalyst. An initial feed containing 5 wt.% of glycerol was continuously fed to the reactor at different feed rates (1.05, 2.15, and 3.60 g/min). The effects of feed glycerol concentration (i.e. 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 wt.%) on glycerol conversion, H2 yield and product distributions were determined. Finally, comparison between supercritical water reforming and conventional steam reforming was also examined."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Glycerol (Fisher scientific, USP/FCC) was mixed with deionized water (DI water) at the desired weight fraction. Acetaldehyde (Sigma–Aldrich, ≥99.5%), acetol (Aldrich, 90%), methanol (Caledon, ≥99.8%), acetic acid (Sigma–Aldrich, 99.7%), propionaldehyde (Sigma–Aldrich, 97%), allyl alcohol (Aldrich, 99%), acetone (Sigma–Aldrich, 99.9%), acrolein (Sigma–Aldrich, 90%), ethanol (Sigma–Aldrich, HPLC grade), ethylene glycol (Acros Organics, 99.5%), and acrylic acid (Aldrich, 99%) were used as standards for identifying concentrations in the liquid product. 1-4 Butanediol (Sigma–Aldrich, 99%) was used as an internal standard. Mixed gas (Praxair, 30% CO, 30% CO2, 25% CH4, 10% C2H4, and 5% C2H6), hydrogen (Praxair, 99.999%), and nitrogen (Praxair, 99.999%) were mixed to fill a Kynar gas sampling bag (Cole–Parmer, 6″ × 6″) at different concentrations for making calibration curves for gas analysis (GC analysis). Note that a stainless steel screen (Sigma–Aldrich, 60 mesh) was placed at the bottom of the reactor to act as a filter to prevent carbon particles that may be formed to be carried over to the back pressure regulator."
3,Apparatus and method,"2.2 Apparatus and method A schematic diagram of the supercritical water reforming system is shown in Fig. 1 . First, DI water was fed at a set flow rate through a high pressure pump (Thar designs) to the preheater (Thar designs) where it was heated to 200 °C. It was further heated from 200 °C to the desired operating temperature inside the furnace (Fisher scientific). The other feed, consisting of a glycerol–water mixture, was delivered by a syringe pump (Teledyne Isco, 260D) and mixed with the heated DI water. The mixture flowed downward through the Inconel 625 reactor (Autoclave Engineer Inc., 3 in long, 2.13 in o.d., and 0.5 in i.d. mainly contains Ni and Cr about 61 and 21 wt.%, respectively). The product stream was cooled down to 10 °C by a heat exchanger cooler (Polyscience) before entering the back pressure regulator (Thar designs). Subsequently, it was delivered to a gas–liquid separator where gas products flowed to the top. The gases were collected in a Kynar gas sampling bag, and then analyzed by gas chromatography (GC, Varian CP-3800). The liquid product at the bottom of the separator was periodically sampled for liquid analysis by GC (Agilent 6890). The average error calculated from carbon balance is found to be within the range of 8% for all experiments. ICM software (Thar designs) was used for controlling the system including the high pressure pump and the preheater."
4,Feed rate and residence time,"2.3 Feed rate and residence time Three levels of feed rates including low feed rate (1.05 g/min), medium feed rate (2.15 g/min), and high feed rate (3.60 g/min) were considered. As the feed glycerol concentration was around 5 wt.%, it was assumed that the fluid density could be approximated by that of pure water. Wagner and Kruse [27], May et al. [10], and Bennekom et al. [19] calculated the residence time using Eq. (1) where V R is the reactor's volume, ϕ is the bed void fraction (=1 for empty reactor), ρ R is the density of pure water at the reactor conditions of P and T, and m 0 is the mass flow rate of the mixture to the reactor. (1) τ = V R · ϕ · ρ R m 0 × 60 From Eq. (1), the residence time depends on the density of pure water, and thus depends on the operating temperature. With operating temperature between 450 and 575 °C, the residence time for low, medium and high feed rates are in the range of 39–60 s, 19–30 s and 11–18 s, respectively. The conversion of glycerol (Eq. (2)), concentration in gas phase (Eq. (3)), yield of H2 (Eq. (4)), and yield of carbon containing species i (Eq. (5)) are defined as follows. (2) X Glycerol = F Glycerol,in − F Glycerol, out F Glycerol,in (3) Concentration in gas phase of species i ( mol% ) = F i ,gas ∑ n F i , gas × 100 (4) Yield of H 2 ( mol H 2 mol Glycerol, in ) = F H 2 F Glycerol, in (5) Yield of carbon containing species i ( mol carbon containing species i mol Glycerol,in ) = F i F Glycerol, in number of carbon atom in molecule i 3 where F Glycerol,in and F Glycerol,out are the inlet and outlet glycerol molar flow rates, respectively, and F i is the molar flow rate of species i."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effect of feed rate and operating temperature,"3.1 Effect of feed rate and operating temperature Glycerol conversion is highly dependent on the operating temperature as shown in Fig. 2 . The glycerol conversion at 450 °C for all feed rates was less than 0.15. In the temperature range of 475–525 °C, increasing the operating temperature linearly increased glycerol conversion. The low feed rate (high residence time) showed the highest conversion in this temperature range. In the range 525–575 °C, the low and medium feed rates show similar trends for glycerol conversion. No significant difference in conversions was observed since they would have enough residence time in the reactor to allow glycerol to react. However carbon formation was more pronounced at low feed rate and high operating temperatures _ this will be discussed further later. Therefore, the medium feed rate was chosen as the most suitable feed rate to reach the highest glycerol conversion – nearly complete conversion was achieved especially at 550 °C (conversion = 0.95) – without carbon formation. Fig. 3(a), (b) and (c) shows the composition of gas products including H2, CO, CH4, and CO2 for low, medium and high feed rates, respectively. Similar trends are observed for all feed rates. It is clear that H2 is the main component in the gas product with a composition as high as 64 mol%. Theoretically, up to 70 mol% H2 and 30 mol% CO2 can be obtained from complete glycerol steam reforming (Eq. (6)). The concentration of H2 slightly decreased when the temperature changed from 450 to 525 °C but then slightly increased when the temperature increased from 525 to 575 °C. The total product gas flow rate indicated in Fig. 3 is closely related to the extent of the reforming reaction. Clearly, the total flow rate and H2 flow rate increased when increasing operating temperature and feed rate. This corresponds to the trend in glycerol conversion shown in Fig. 2. Increasing the operating temperature increased the CO content in the gas phase for temperatures up to 525 °C but subsequently decreased when the temperature was higher than 525 °C. The concentration in the gas phase of CO2 showed an opposite trend to that of CO. The high content of CO and the decrease in CO mole fraction at high temperatures were reported by Lee et al. [29] who studied supercritical water gasification of glucose in a Hastelloy C276 reactor without catalyst. The trend for H2, CO, and CO2 content in the gas phase could be explained by the water gas shift reaction (WGS, Eq. (7)). At operating temperatures higher than 525 °C, the increase in H2 and CO2, and the decrease of CO concentrations was observed, indicating that the WGS reaction starts to play an important role at temperatures higher than 525 °C. Some authors called it a “fast type water gas shift reaction” ([29,30]). Holgate et al. [30] and Lee et al. [29] reported this type of WGS above 575 °C and 550 °C, respectively, in supercritical water gasification of glucose. As seen in Fig. 3, CH4 is another main gaseous product whose amount was, nonetheless, not greater than 6 mol% in the temperature range 450–575 °C. It slightly increased when increasing the operating temperature. For other gases detected in the product stream, their concentrations were lower than 3.1 mol% with C2H6 as a main byproduct, especially at higher operating temperatures. C2H4, C3H8, and C3H6 were not significantly changed when compared to C2H6. However, the influence becomes more pronounced at lower operating temperature and higher feed rate as shown in Fig. 3(a)–(c). Considering the product yields, Fig. 4(a) shows that the yield of H2 increased with increasing the operating temperature (from 0.03 at 450 °C to 3.34 at 575 °C) corresponding to the endothermic steam reforming (Eq. (6)). Above 500 °C, the medium feed rate seems to offer a suitable residence time for enhancing hydrogen production until 575 °C. Recall that the theoretical maximum yield is 7, as per Eq. (6)). H2 yield at high temperature, c.a. 575 °C, with medium feed rate is unexpectedly similar to equilibrium yield of H2. However, it could not be from approaching thermodynamic equilibrium as discussed later. Steam reforming: (6) CH 2 OHCHOHCH 2 OH + 3 H 2 O ↔ 3 CO 2 + 7 H 2 ; Δ H 298 K = + 122.81 kJ mol − 1 Water gas shift reaction: (7) CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 ; Δ H 298 K = − 41.17 kJ mol − 1 Yields of CO, CO2, CH4, C2H6, C2H4, C3H8, and C3H6 were also increased by increasing the operating temperatures as shown in Fig. 4(b)–(h). The main reason was that the higher operating temperatures promoted more products in the gas phase because of the increase in glycerol conversion. Buhler et al. [24] and Benenekom et al. [19] stated that free radical pathways were favored at higher operating temperature which promoted more gaseous products. However, yields of CO, C2H4, and C3H6 decreased when increasing the operating temperature between 550 and 575 °C. It should be noted that problems were encountered with the low feed rate at high temperature (i.e. 550–575 °C) and the medium feed rate at 575 °C characterized by pressure fluctuations that the back pressure regulator could not control because of the formation of solid particles, likely due to tar or coking. It implies that operating temperatures too high caused failure in operation especially in the low and medium feed rate cases. It can be concluded that the medium feed rate offers suitable residence times for operating temperatures between 525 °C (23 s) and 550 °C (21 s). The problem of carbon formation can be explained by the Boudouard and cracking reactions. It was probably caused by the promotion of the Boudouard reaction (Eq. (8)) as observed by the decrease in CO (Fig. 4(b)) and increase in CO2 (Fig. 4(c)). This reaction is exothermic and consequently is favored at temperatures not too high. However, the Boudouard reaction is kinetically driven while the WGS quickly reaches chemical equilibrium at those temperatures, which is likely the case of most supercritical water reforming reactions [19]. The decrease of CO with increasing CO2 would thus be mainly due to the WGS reaction. It could also be from the endothermic methane cracking reaction (Eq. (9)) and ethylene cracking (Eq. (10)) as observed by the change of CH4 and C2H4 trend for low and medium feed rates at high temperature (Fig. 4(d) and (f)). Boudouard reaction: (8) 2 CO ↔ CO 2 + C ( s ) ; Δ H 298 K = − 172.45 kJ mol − 1 Methane cracking: (9) CH 4 ↔ 2 H 2 + C ( s ) ; Δ H 298 K = + 74.52 kJ mol − 1 Ethylene cracking: (10) C 2 H 4 ↔ 2 H 2 + 2 C ( s ) ; Δ H 298 K = − 52.51 kJ mol − 1 Some authors also suggested that C2H4 was a precursor of carbon formation (Eq. (10)) [26,31]. The results agreed with Therdthianwong et al. [26] who found that carbon formation occurred at low H2O to feedstock (ethanol) ratio and/or high operating temperature (≥550 °C) for a reaction in an Inconel 625 reactor. Analysis of the liquid products revealed a variety of components including acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), acetol (CH3COCH2OH), methanol (CH3OH), acetic acid (CH3COOH), propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO), and allyl alcohol (CH2CHCH2OH), as shown in Fig. 5(a)–(f) . However, the product yields for acetone (CH3COCH3), acrolein (CH2CHCHO), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), ethylene glycol (CH2OHCH2OH), and acrylic acid (CH2CHCOOH) were less than 0.01, which can be considered negligible. All components detected correspond to those found by Buhler et al. [24] and May et al. [10] except ethylene glycol that was not reported in their product compositions. It might be due to its very low concentration and/or the difference in operating parameters i.e. 349–475 °C with the empty reactor [24], and 350 bars with 1%Ru/Al2O3 [10]. However, ethylene glycol was observed as a product via the fragmentation reaction (Eq. (11)), as reported by Xu et al. [22]. (11) CH 2 OHCHOHCH 2 OH ↔ CH 2 OHCH 2 OH + HCHO ; Δ H 298 K = + 81.8 kJ mol − 1 As shown in Fig. 5(a)–(f), it was observed that the liquid product yields initially increased with increasing operating temperature, and then became constant or decreased at high operating temperatures. Low glycerol conversion at low operating temperature resulted in low liquid product yields as well as low gas product yields, as discussed previously. At higher operating temperatures (525–575 °C), the reduction in liquid product yields was observed as they could be further reacted to gas products. Acetaldehyde is the main liquid product with a yield up to 0.29 (medium feed rate) at 525 °C and is produced according to Eq. (12) [24,32,33], and then drastically decreased by about 70% (0.09) at operating temperatures approaching 575 °C. Formaldehyde was also produced during the reaction, but could subsequently react to form H2, CO, and CO2 according to Eqs. (13) [10,22,34], and (7) [35], eventually resulting in no formaldehyde in the gas and liquid phases. Decrease in acetaldehyde could be explained by its partial reaction with water and decomposition to gas products in the 525–575 °C temperature range, as indicated by Eqs. (14) and (15) [36]. Decomposition of glycerol: (12) CH 2 OHCHOHCH 2 OH ↔ CH 3 CHO + HCHO + H 2 O ; Δ H 298 K = + 61.29 kJ mol − 1 Decomposition of formaldehyde: (13) HCHO ↔ H 2 + CO ; Δ H 298 K = − 1.93 kJ mol − 1 Acetaldehyde steam reforming: (14) CH 3 CHO + H 2 O ↔ CH 3 OH + CO + H 2 ; Δ H 298 K = + 96.54 kJ mol − 1 Methanol steam reforming: (15) CH 3 OH + H 2 O ↔ 3 H 2 + CO 2 ; Δ H 298 K = + 49.24 kJ mol − 1 Dehydration of glycerol: (16) CH 2 OHCHOHCH 2 OH ↔ CH 3 COCH 2 OH + H 2 O ; Δ H 298 K = − 36.96 kJ mol − 1 Decomposition of glycerol: (17) CH 2 OHCHOHCH 2 OH ↔ CH 3 COOH + CH 3 OH ; Δ H 298 K = − 55.84 kJ mol − 1 Minor liquid products including acetol, methanol, and acetic acid were detected with maximum yields of around 0.10, 0.02, and 0.02, respectively. Acetol, normally formed by the dehydration of glycerol (Eq. (16)) [10,37], reached a maximum around 500–525 °C and then dramatically decreased when increasing the operating temperature (Fig. 5(b)). Methanol probably arose from the partial steam reforming reaction of acetaldehyde (Eq. (14)) [36] and/or from the decomposition of glycerol (Eq. (17)) [7]. The highest yield of methanol was obtained around 525 °C (Fig. 5(c)). Moreover, acetic acid was also formed as a product from Eq. (17). However, it was totally suppressed at low operating temperatures (450–475 °C) (Fig. 5(d)). Luo et al. [7] proposed a reaction pathway of acetic acid formation by reformingglycerol to CH2–OH and CH–OH–CH2OH (rearrangement with dehydrogenation) intermediates by C–C cleavage. Propionaldehyde, and allyl alcohol were also detected in our study with yields of less than 0.02. May et al. [10] proposed that their formations occurred from the similar CH2–CHOH–CH2OH intermediate. The dependence of the product distribution on operating temperature has been known by the differences in activation energies, and by the density dependence of the reaction pathways [24]. Equilibrium calculations were done in Aspen Plus using minimization of Gibbs' free energy. From a thermodynamic point of view, complete glycerol conversion is attained for all operating temperatures in the range 450–575 °C, and the gas product should mainly consist of H2, CO2, and CH4 with negligible amounts of CO, as shown in Fig. 4(a)–(c) (represent by cross symbol). Therefore, the reaction could not have reached equilibrium as the presence of gaseous and liquid products, which are not found in the predicted equilibrium calculations, resulted in differences between the experimental yields of H2, CO, CO2, and CH4 and those from the equilibrium calculations."
7,Effect of feed glycerol concentration,"3.2 Effect of feed glycerol concentration The optimum feed rate which offers the maximum H2 yield from the previous section was 2.15 g/min (medium feed rate). At 525–575 °C, conversion of glycerol was slightly increased as shown in Fig. 2. Thus 525 °C was chosen for further study in this section as it has the lowest energy requirement in the above temperature range, and as no carbon was formed at this temperature. Fig. 6(a) and (b) shows the effect of feed glycerol concentration (2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 wt.%) at 525 °C and 250 bar on glycerol conversion and compositions of gas products. Conversion of glycerol was decreased by increasing the feed glycerol concentration as shown in Fig. 6(a). A possible explanation is that higher amount of H2O could enhance the consumption of glycerol and its intermediate via several reactions, e.g. steam reforming (Eqs. (6) and (14)). Hence glycerol conversion would decrease with increasing the feed glycerol concentration. Alternatively, as lower wall-to-glycerol ratio is obtained with higher feed glycerol concentration, the active sites on Inconel 625 reactor wall may be fully adsorbed with glycerol and therefore more molecules of glycerol at higher feed glycerol concentration could be prevented from adsorbing on the reactor wall. Increasing the feed glycerol concentration from 2.5 to 5 wt.% decreased H2 and CO2 concentrations but increased CO concentration, following the thermodynamics of reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS, Eq. (7)). However, for glycerol feed concentrations in the range 5–10 wt.%, compositions in the gas phase of H2, CO and CO2 were slightly changed with a similar trend as that influenced by the RWGS. Feed glycerol concentrations of 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0 wt.% represent water to glycerol molar ratios of 199.37, 97.13, 63.05, and 46.01, respectively. Boukis et al. [20] stated that the higher water content in methanol supercritical water reforming without addition of a catalyst (Inconel 625 reactor) promoted the WGS reaction (Eq. (7)). The concentrations of other gas products, including C2H6, C2H4, C3H8, and C3H6, increased with increasing the feed glycerol concentration. This might be due to the fact that increasing the feed glycerol concentration (decreasing molar water to glycerol ratio) reduces the reforming of carbon intermediates to light gaseous products (H2, CO, CO2, and CH4). However, the maximum C2–C3 hydrocarbons were observed for C2H6 with a maximum value of only 1.01%, as shown in Fig. 6(b). A similar behavior was reported in supercritical water from bio-ethanol reforming as WGS where the reforming of carbon intermediates were enhanced by higher water to organic molar ratios [26]. It was seen that a decrease in glycerol conversion lowered all major gas product yields. Since glycerol conversion decreases when increasing feed glycerol concentration, it is not surprising that this is also accompanied by a decrease in the main gas product yields, including H2, CO, CO2, and CH4, as shown in Fig. 7(a) . For example, the H2 yield decreased from 2.86 to 1.04 when the feed glycerol concentration increased from 2.5 to 10 wt.%. A similar behavior was observed in some previous works [9,12,26,28]. The CO yield decreased when increasing feed glycerol concentration above a certain value. For lower feed glycerol concentration, the CO yields was not affected by the feed glycerol concentration, at least not in the range 2.5–5 wt.% feed concentration. This might be due to the RWGS reaction (Eq. (7)), and/or acetaldehyde steam reforming (Eq. (14)), and/or the decomposition of acetaldehyde (Eq. (18)), which produced more CO at higher feed glycerol concentration. CH4 yield was very low and remained more or less constant in the range of glycerol feed concentration considered here. Gas yields were also confirmed by the measurement of volumetric gas flow rate as shown in Table 1 and which indicates that an increase in feed glycerol concentration significantly decreased the product gas flow rate, and thus the product gas yield observed in Fig. 7(a). For C2H6, C2H4, C3H8, and C3H6 yields, they were observed to be less than 0.02 as shown in Fig. 7(b). Decomposition of acetaldehyde: (18) CH 3 CHO ↔ CO + CH 4 ; Δ H 298 = − 18.85 kJ mol − 1 For the liquid analysis, it is shown in Table 2 that acetaldehyde was the major product in the liquid phase. Acetaldehyde yield increased from 0.24 to 0.29 with increasing feed glycerol concentration from 2.5 to 5 wt.%, and then it decreased when further increasing feed glycerol concentration. The decrease in acetaldehyde yield with increasing feed glycerol concentration follows the trend of decreasing glycerol conversion with increasing feed glycerol concentration (Fig. 6(a)); however, the decrease of the acetaldehyde yield when decreasing the feed glycerol concentration from 5 to 2.5 wt.% is likely due to the further reactions of acetaldehyde to gas phase products (Eqs. (14), (18)). On the other hand, the acetol yield was increased when increasing glycerol concentration until 5 wt.%, and then remained almost constant for feed glycerol concentration in the range 5–10 wt.%. The initial increase can be explained by the dehydration of glycerol (Eq. (16)). Chiu et al. [37] stated that using a small amount of water promoted acetol formation. In contrast, increasing the feed glycerol concentration inhibited acrolein formation, as observed from acrolein yield of 0.02 at only 2.5% feed glycerol concentration. Methanol, propionaldehyde, acetone, allyl alcohol, acetic acid, and ethylene glycol yields were detected in very low amounts. Table 3 illustrates the comparison of selected results of glycerol reforming in supercritical water. As shown in this Table, Inconel 625 reactor without catalyst and any additives exhibit reasonable H2 yield at relatively low temperature."
8,Comparison between “conventional steam reforming” and “supercritical water reforming”,"3.3 Comparison between “conventional steam reforming” and “supercritical water reforming” Although this paper focused on supercritical water conditions at 250 bar, it was also interesting to compare the performance of glycerol reforming under conventional steam reforming and under supercritical steam reforming (medium feed rate 2.15 g/min, 525 °C, and 5 wt.% feed glycerol concentration), carried out in the same empty Inconel 625 reactor. Broll et al. [34] compared the physicochemical properties of water at 400 °C between supercritical water (250 bar) and superheated steam (1 bar) and observed that the thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity and density of supercritical water were higher than those of superheated steam by around 3, 3 times and 4 orders of magnitude, respectively. The higher thermal conductivity of supercritical water than superheated steam is very favorable to promote endothermic reactions, in particular steam reforming (Eq. (6)) that promotes production of more hydrogen gas. Moreover, higher density leads to a higher space-time yield in supercritical water condition [17,20]. Fig. 8 illustrates the performance comparison between steam reforming and supercritical water reforming. Conversion of glycerol at high pressure reached 0.87, which was much higher than at ambient pressure (0.21). The trends in total and H2 flow rates also corresponded to those with glycerol conversion. Furthermore, with steam reforming at 1 bar, the reactions could proceed for only 2 h, after which it had to be stopped because of too much carbon formation, while no problems were encountered in the supercritical water case presented here. CH4 formation was inhibited at ambient pressure, therefore leading to higher H2 and lower CO contents. However, it should be noted that addition of some catalysts and/or higher operating temperatures might be necessary to achieve higher conversion at ambient pressure. Many efforts on catalyst studies e.g. ruthenium catalysts [41], ceria-supported metal catalysts [42], Ni/MgO [1], alumina-supported metal catalysts [2] have been reported. Zhang et al. [42], Adhikari et al. [2], and Slinn et al. [43] reported that suitable conditions to produce hydrogen from glycerol steam reforming (1 bar) were at 550 °C (Ir/CeO2), 627 °C (Rh/CeO2/Al2O3), 860 °C (Pt/Al2O3) for which glycerol conversion of 1.00, 0.94, and 1.00 could be obtained, respectively. Yields of gas and liquid products are shown in Tables 4 and 5 . H2, CO, CO2, and acetaldehyde were observed as the main products in both conditions. However, in supercritical water conditions their yields were higher. It is worth noting that in the case of reforming at 1 bar, others components, including CH4, C2H6, C2H4, C3H8, C3H6 in the gas phase, and methanol, acetol, propionaldehyde, acetic acid, and ethylene glycol in liquid phase were found in only trace amounts. Azadi et al. [44] compared the catalytic near-critical water gasification (200 bar, 360–450 °C) and steam reforming of glucose (1 bar, 500–800 °C) and reported that steam reforming offered higher hydrogen composition in gas phase. However it might use more energy consumption compared to near-critical water gasification process from operation at higher temperature. Azadi et al.'s observations are corroborated by findings in the present work which shows that steam reforming yielded higher hydrogen purity in the gas phase, but it could not be operated longer than 2 h because of carbon formation. It can be concluded that operation at supercritical water conditions allows lower operating temperatures and higher glycerol conversion."
9,Conclusion,"Hydrogen production from glycerol reforming was investigated in an Inconel 625 reactor under supercritical water conditions at 250 bar. With 5 wt.% glycerol in the feed, glycerol conversion and hydrogen yield increased when increasing the operating temperature from 450 to 575 °C. However, carbon formation was found to be a serious problem for low (1.05 g/min) and medium (2.15 g/min) feed rates at high operating temperatures of 550–575 °C and 575 °C, respectively. From the gas analysis, it was concluded that the WGS reaction plays an important role at operating temperatures higher than 525 °C. From the liquid analysis, acetaldedehyde and acetol were the main liquid products with compositions up to 74, and 20 mol%, respectively. The effect of feed glycerol concentration was investigated and it was found that lower concentration at 2.5 wt.% supported the hydrogen production in term of glycerol conversion (0.91) and yield of H2 (2.86) for operation at 525 °C, and residence time of 23 s without carbon formation. Moreover, comparison between steam reforming at 1 bar and supercritical water reforming at 250 bar indicated that supercritical water reforming was superior in term of hydrogen production and inhibition of carbon formation."
