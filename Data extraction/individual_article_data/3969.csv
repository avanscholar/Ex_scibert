0,Introduction,"Toxic liquid discharges and greenhouse gas emissions are major concerns associated with municipal solid waste (MSW) management. In 2010, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the annual production of MSW was estimated at approximately 250 million tonnes with 136 million tonnes (54.2%) sent to landfills [1]. In comparison, in 2008, Canadians generated 34 million tonnes of MSW of which 76% was disposed in landfills [2]. The organic fraction of MSW (OFMSW) is relatively large, with the food and paper components accounting for 51% and 17%, respectively [3]. These two components could serve as a potential feedstock for producing chemicals. Converting low-value feedstocks such as OFMSW into biofuels is a challenging and emerging research area. Hydrogen is a promising alternative to fuels derived from fossil sources because it is considered a clean and environmentally friendly energy source. According to Benemann [4], the most promising method for producing H2 is dark fermentation. Dark fermentation anaerobic microorganisms do not require light as an energy source and they can utilize non-sterile feedstocks [5,6]. In addition, dark fermentation is considered economically feasible because the process is able to generate H2 from substrates which are produced from low-value biomass [7]. However, a major disadvantage is that low yields are primarily attributed to H2 consumption by microorganisms such as methanogens and homoacetogens [6]. Suppressing H2-consumers and enriching the H2-producing populations have been reported using heat [8–12], aeration [10,13], shock loading [14], freezing and thawing [11], acid [8–13] alkali [9,10,12,13] 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid (BESA) [12] iodopropane [12], chloroform [8,11] acetylene [15] and long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) [16,17]. LCFAs are present in oleochemicals such vegetable oils as well as animal fats. Although controlling H2-consumers have been demonstrated using a variety of methods, an economical and sustainable method has not been reported. In addition to the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW), various other substrates have been used to produce H2 using mixed anaerobic communities. These substrates include carbohydrates, such as glucose, xylose, sucrose and lactose and also molasses and starch [7,18]. In addition, fruit waste [19], palm oil mill effluent [20], food waste (FW) [21–24] paper waste [25,26] and organic solid waste [27,28] have been examined as potential feedstocks for producing H2 using mixed microbial cultures. The impact of various factors (pH, inoculum concentration, C:N ratio, buffer concentration, substrate concentration, temperature, inoculum type) on H2 production using food waste has been reported in a few studies [23,29]. However, studies on factor optimization using paper-cardboard waste (PCW) or a PCW plus food waste blend is sparse and no data is available to demonstrate the impact of the two feedstocks on different microbial populations (methanogens, homoacetogens, H2 producers). Hence, additional research is required to assess and optimize factors affecting the performance of H2-producing cultures utilizing feedstock chemicals derived from a steam exploded synthetic OFMSW. Conducting optimization studies using a ‘one-factor at a time’ approach could lead to the misinterpretation of data, especially in cases when the interaction effects are not considered in the analysis. Restrictions caused by the single factor approach can be removed by employing response surface methodology (RSM). Statistical methods such as the Plackett–Burman design (PBD) and the Box–Behnken design (BBD) [30] are efficient methods to systematically investigate the impact of many experimental factors. The BBD approach is useful in reducing cost, minimizing the number of experiments and optimizing the experimental factors. Factors controlling H2-producing mixed anaerobic communities include syntrophic decoupling chemical agents, pH and reactant concentration. Linoleic acid (LA), a byproduct from the hydrolysis of many unsaturated vegetable oils, is effective in controlling the growth of many H2 consuming populations [16,17,31]. The COD concentration to biomass ratio can significantly affect the performance of H2-producing microorganisms [23,32]. In addition to the LA and COD concentration, pH can also affect microbial H2 production [33]. One objective of this study was to use a BBD design to assess the effects of pH, COD concentration and LA concentration on H2 production. Another objective was to determine the microbial profile of a mixed anaerobic community under selected experimental conditions."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Feedstock preparation,"2.1 Feedstock preparation A synthetic food waste with a known composition was used to minimize compositional variation in the OFMSW. A recipe for preparing a synthetic food waste was based on waste derived from a typical diet as per the Canada Food Guide [34]. The synthetic food waste included the following components: cooked rice (13 wt%), cooked pasta (13 wt%), bread (10 wt%), plus scraps obtained from legumes (18 wt%), potato (10 wt%), lettuce (8 wt%), broccoli (8 wt%), apple (10 wt%) and banana (10 wt%). A paper and cardboard mixture was prepared using 50 g paper and 50 g corrugated cardboard in 1.5 L water. A thick homogenous slurry was prepared by homogenizing the mixture in a blender operating at 500 rpm. The slurry was divided into three equal portions of which two were heated in a steam explosion reactor in batch mode with a working volume of 1 L. One portion was heated for 1 h at 160 °C, another portion was heated at 180 °C for 1 h while the remaining portion was left untreated (Table 1 ). The samples were filtered and analyzed for COD, free reducing sugars, furfural and hydroxy methyl furfural. The FW liquor and paper-cardboard waste (PCW) liquors were blended 1:1 ratio based on the COD concentration and used in different experiments (Table 2 ). All the treated and untreated liquid samples were stored at −4 °C."
3,Microbial culture source and basal medium,"2.2 Microbial culture source and basal medium The granular culture was obtained from a brewery manufacturing wastewater treatment facility (Guelph, ON) and maintained in the 5 L reactor with 10 g L−1 volatile suspended solids (VSS). On a volume basis, a granular anaerobic culture contains greater amount of microorganisms and hence, able to handle higher COD loadings when compared to flocculated cultures. Maintaining the culture and preparing the basal media was conducted using methods described by Chaganti et al. [16]. The basal medium contained the following ingredients (mg L−1): NaHCO3, 6000; NH4HCO3, 70; KCl, 25; K2HPO4, 14; (NH4)2SO4, 10; Yeast extract, 10; MgCl2·4H2O, 9; FeCl2·4H2O, 2; EDTA, 1; MnCl2·4H2O, 0.5; CoCl2·6H2O, 0.15; Na2SeO3, 0.1; (NH4)6MoO7·4H2O, 0.09; ZnCl2, 0.05; H3BO3, 0.05; NiCl2·6H2O, 0.05; and CuCl2·2H2O, 0.03 [35]."
4,Experimental procedures,"2.3 Experimental procedures Batch experiments were conducted in 160 mL serum bottles. The inoculum was adjusted to a final concentration of 2 g L−1 VSS using basal medium. A LA stock solution (100 g L−1) was prepared au-bain marie [36] and added to achieve levels of 1 and 2 g L−1 in the microbial culture (Table 2). After mixing the culture plus LA at 200 rpm for 24 h, liquors from the steam explosion food waste (FW) or paper-cardboard blend were added to the serum bottles. The quantity of liquor added was based on the COD concentration. The final pH was adjusted (4.5–6.5) as per the experimental design conditions (Table 2). The total liquid volume was maintained at 50 mL. Anaerobic conditions were maintained by purging the reactors with nitrogen (Praxair, ON (>99% purity)) for 5 min. The bottles were sealed with Teflon® lined red rubber septas and capped with Aluminium crimp caps and then placed on a shaker set at 200 rpm (Innova 2100 (New Brunswick Scientific, CA)) in a 37 °C temperature controlled chamber."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The TSS, VSS and the COD content of the steam exploded liquor were determined in accordance to Standard Methods [37]. Headspace (H2 and CH4) samples were analyzed every 12 h using gas chromatography (GC) until a maximum H2 yield was attained. Liquid samples (volatile fatty acids (VFAs), alcohols and glucose) were analyzed using ion chromatography (IC) every 36 h. The GC and IC methods were previously reported by Chowdhury et al. [38]. The detection limit for lactate, formate, acetate, propionate and butyrate was 0.5 mg L−1 while for glucose and alcohols the detection limits were 1.0 and 5.0 mg L−1, respectively. The detection limits for H2 (Praxair, ON (>99% purity)) and CH4 (Praxair, ON (>99% purity)) were 0.0032 kPa [5 μL/bottle (160 mL)] and 0.0064 kPa [5 μL/bottle (160 mL)], respectively. The quantity of free reducing sugars was determined using the dinitrosalicylic acid method [39]. The detection limit for the reducing sugars was 100 mg L−1. Furfural and HMF were analyzed using a high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) (Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC) configured with a photo-diode array (PDA) detector and a 3.0 × 100 mm column (Dionex Eclipse plus C18 column). The flow rate of the eluent (80% of 0.5% H3PO4 solution and 20% methanol) was set at 0.2 mL min−1. The analysis was conducted under isocratic conditions with an oven set at 50 °C. The instrument was set to scan at 280 nm. The detection limit for furfural and HMF was 0.5 mg L−1 using a 10 μL injection volume."
6,Experimental design and optimization study,"2.5 Experimental design and optimization study The optimum conditions for maximizing the H2 yield were determined using response surface methodology (RSM). The optimization study used a 3 k factorial BBD with three replicates. The design factors and their levels are tabulated in Table 2. A full quadratic (second order) response surface was adopted for the BBD. The experimental response (mL H2 g COD−1 and mL CH4 g COD−1) was analyzed statistically using Minitab 16 (Minitab Inc., State College, PA). Repeating three experiments at the central point was used to determine the magnitude of error or “noise”. Responses from factors other than those under consideration in the experimental design were considered as errors. The H2 yield and CH4 yield (responses) recorded at each design point of the BBD (Table 2) were the response variables. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the experimental response was used to evaluate a full quadratic approximation of the response surface model. The order of the response model was determined from the degree of curvature of the response surface model [40]. Quantifying the deviation of residuals from a normal distribution was conducted using the Anderson–Darling (AD) test. Validity of residuals distribution at a 5% level of significance signify minimal bias in the model [41]. Another method of multi-response optimization is the desirability function [42]. An algorithm from Minitab was used to compute the D-optimality values for the three experimental factors (LA concentration, initial pH and initial COD concentration) and the levels for each experimental factor which yielded a maximum response (maximum H2 and minimum CH4 yields)."
7,Principal component analysis,"2.6 Principal component analysis A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using the Minitab 16 (Minitab Inc., State College, PA) to assess the effect of different factors (LA concentration, initial pH and initial COD concentration) on the distribution of the soluble metabolites. The byproducts concentrations (H2, CH4, acetic acid, butyric acid, propionic acid, formic acid, lactic acid, and ethanol) were inputs to the PCA."
8,Microbial analysis,2.7 Microbial analysis LA treated and untreated culture samples were collected after 36 h (at maximum H2 production) and analyzed for microbial diversity using Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) [33]. DNA isolated from the microbial samples were quantified and amplified using dye labelled universal 16S bacterial primers designed for bacteria using the procedure described by Chaganti et al. [33]. The PCR products were purified and further digested with two restriction enzymes (Hae III and Hha I). The restriction digested PCR product fragment sizes were quantified on a Licor DNA analyzer using acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Further the Terminal Restriction fragments (T-RFs) were aligned for Phylogenetic assignment according to the Chaganti et al. [33] and analyzed using Phylogenetic Assignment Tool (https://secure.limnology.wisc.edu/trflp/) with a fragment bin tolerance of 2 bp.
9,Statistical analyses of microbial profiles,2.8 Statistical analyses of microbial profiles Duplicate samples of the T-RFLP profiles were aligned on the basis of T-RFLP band sizes and individual peak areas using the moving average algorithm included in the T-Align software [43]. T-RFLP profiles obtained from the restriction enzyme Hae III were used in a non-parametric multivariate cluster analysis (MCA). The Kulczynski index was used to quantify the similarity between species [44]. The index compared the different clusters to determine their homogeneity. The right column (leaf nodes) of the dendrogram shows data for each individual condition and the nodes representing the clusters. The horizontal lines represent the similarity between the populations. The MCA was performed using the PAST software [45].
10,Results and discussion,
11,Characterisation of steam explosion treated and untreated food and paper-cardboard waste,"3.1 Characterisation of steam explosion treated and untreated food and paper-cardboard waste The COD concentration, the quantity of free reducing sugars, furfural and hydroxy methyl furfural in the steam exploded and untreated samples are shown in Table 1. The steam exploded FW and PCW filtrate samples shows an increase in the COD concentration as well as an increase in the free reducing sugars and the furfurals levels when compared to the untreated filtrate samples. Steam exploded FW at different temperatures revealed that increasing the temperature from 160 °C to 180 °C caused a decrease in the COD concentration as well as the free reducing sugar concentration and an increase in the furfurals (furfural and hydroxyl methyl furfural (HMF)) concentration in the filtrate solution. In contrast, an increase in the COD and furfural concentration and slight decrease in free reducing sugar concentration was detected in the PCW samples (Table 1)."
12,Evaluating biohydrogen and methane production using the Box–Behnken design,"3.2 Evaluating biohydrogen and methane production using the Box–Behnken design The impact of LA concentration on culture pre-treatment, the initial pH and the COD concentration and the effect of their interactions on H2 and CH4 production potential were evaluated using the BBD (Table 2). The treatment levels for each factor were based on previous studies conducted by Chaganti et al. [16] and van Ginkel et al. [46]. Based on studies conducted by van Ginkel et al. [46], the COD range and optimum concentration under which the H2 production reached a maximum were 1.5–44.8 g COD L−1 and 7.5 g L−1, respectively. In this study, the COD concentration range considered for the combined FW plus PCW was 5–10 g COD L−1. Furfural and HMF are a major concern because at threshold levels, they are inhibitory to H2 producers and H2-consumers [47]. Higher furfural and HMF levels were detected in the pretreated FW filtrate relative to the pretreated PCW (Table 1). After mixing the FW (50%) and PCW (50%) steam exploded liquors, the final furfural and HMF levels for 10 g COD L−1 were 8.2 mg L−1 and 92 mg L−1 , respectively. For the response surface optimization, the H2 and CH4 yield was computed at each design point for the three variables and three levels. The experiments had three sets (replicates) of 13 experiments, including a central point for evaluating the factor space (Table 2). The H2 and CH4 yield were the response variables and the computed values at the different factor level combinations were treated statistically. The experimental design matrix and the responses for H2 and CH4 production are shown in Table 2. The results revealed that the range of H2 and CH4 yields varied from 0.08 ± 0.07 to 81 ± 1.2 mL g−1 COD and 0 to 118 ± 3.4 mL g−1 COD, respectively. The model coefficients for the full quadratic equation (Eqs. (1) and (2)) were computed from the experimental responses. (1) Hydrogen yield ( mL g − 1 COD ) = − 1224 − 24.8 × ( LA conc . ) + 446.6 × ( Initial pH ) + 1.68 × ( Initial COD conc . ) − 19.2 × ( LA conc . ) 2 − 41.8 × ( pH ) 2 − 0.76 × ( Initial COD conc . ) 2 + 16.7 × ( LA conc . × Initial pH ) − 1.36 × ( LA conc . × Initial COD conc . ) + 2.49 × ( Initial pH × Initial COD conc . ) (2) Methane yield ( mL g − 1 COD ) = 180 + 66.3 × ( LA conc . ) − 99.5 × ( Initial pH ) + 2.27 × ( Initial COD conc . ) + 14.5 × ( LA conc . ) 2 + 16.7 × ( pH ) 2 + 1.05 × ( Initial COD conc . ) 2 − 24.2 × ( LA conc . × Initial pH ) + 1.86 × ( LA conc . × Initial COD conc . ) − 4.2 × ( Initial pH × Initial COD conc . ) 3.2.1 Model fit by ANOVA Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to establish the adequacy and significance of quadratic models (Eqs. (1) and (2)). The ANOVA output (Table 3 ) for the H2 yield revealed that the model is statistically significant with p-values for linear (pH), quadratic ((LA conc.)2 and (pH)2) and interaction terms ((LA conc.) × (pH)) less than 0.05. The H2 yield is influenced by terms with p-values less than 0.05 when compared to terms with p-values greater than 0.05. Note the F-statistic and p-value of 40 and 0.0, respectively, suggest that the quadratic model fit was significant. The ANOVA output (Table 3) for the CH4 yield showed that other than the initial COD concentration, the model is statistically significant with linear, quadratic and interaction terms with p-values less than 0.05 (Table 3). The quadratic model fit was significant because the F-statistic and p-values were 183 and 0.0, respectively. The large F values clearly indicate that the variation in the response can be explained by the regression equation [48]. 3.2.2 Effects of LA concentration, pH and COD concentration on the H2 and CH4 yield The effect of the three factors (LA concentration, pH and COD concentration) on the response variables (H2 and CH4 yield) is shown in Fig. 1 . Notice increasing LA levels correlated with increasing H2 yields and decreasing CH4 yields (Fig. 1). Methanogenic inhibition with progressively increasing LCFA concentration has been described in many reports [16,31,38,49]. Maximum H2 and minimum CH4 yields were observed at an initial pH value of 5.5 (Fig. 1) while at an initial pH of 4.5, no significant H2 or CH4 production was observed. The maximum CH4 yield was detected in cultures maintained at pH 6.5. In mixed batch mesophilic cultures, decreasing CH4 yields have been observed with decreasing pH values [33,42]. In this study, elevated H2 production and low CH4 levels were associated with increasing the COD concentration (Fig. 1). Beyond a threshold COD concentration, byproducts accumulation to elevated levels likely inhibited methanogenesis and reduce the quantity of methane produced. The optimum level of each variable and their interaction on H2 and CH4 production are shown in the contour plots (Fig. 2 A–C). The contour plots are based on Eqs. (1) and (2) with one variable constant at an optimum level while the remaining two variables are varied within the experimental range. The pH versus LA concentration profile shows a significant increase in the H2 yield and a decrease in the CH4 yield with the pH set at 5.5–6.5 and at an LA concentration range of 1–2 g L−1 (Fig. 2A). Increasing H2 yields and a simultaneous decrease in CH4 production with a pH range from pH 5.5 to 6.0 and a COD concentration range from 8 to 10 g COD L−1 is shown in the COD versus pH concentration profile (Fig. 2B). Increasing H2 yields and decreasing levels of CH4 with an LA concentration range from 1.0 to 1.9 g L−1 and a COD concentration from 7 to 10 g COD L−1 is shown in the LA versus COD concentration profile (Fig. 2C). For experiments conducted at an initial pH 4.5, no significant CH4 was observed. Methane production is expected to decrease at low threshold pH values because methanogenesis is inhibited [12]. 3.2.3 Response surface model verification The coefficient of determination (R 2) values explained 92.7% and 98.2% variability of the response for H2 and CH4, respectively (Fig. 3 (A and B)). These values indicate good agreement between the experimental and predicted values. In addition, they imply that the model is able to reliably predict the H2 and CH4 yields. Residuals are useful indicators in determining the adequacy of fitting the model to the experimental data. The D statistic was used to confirm the normal distribution of the residuals (Fig. 4 ). The calculated AD statistic values of 0.52 and 0.37 for H2 and CH4, respectively, were less than a critical value of 0.752 for a sample size of 30 and at a 5% level of significance [41,50]. The p-values (>0.05) of 0.17 and 0.4 for H2 and CH4, respectively, confirm a normal distribution of the residuals. This suggests the model include no systemic biases over the range of factors under consideration. The D-optimality value was computed for all levels of the three experimental factors (LA concentration, initial pH and initial COD concentration (Table 2)). The largest D-optimality of 0.99046 and 1.0 with maximum and minimum response values of approximately 91 and 0.0 mL g−1 COD for H2 and CH4, respectively, was computed at 1.6 g L−1 LA, an initial pH of 5.93 and a COD of 9.34 g L−1 (Fig. 5 ). Additional experiments were conducted near the computed optimal factor setting of 1.62 g L−1 LA, an initial pH 5.93 and 9.34 g L−1 COD concentration. The experimental response (87 mL H2 g−1 COD or 97.8 mL H2 g−1 VS) was approximately 4% less than the predicted maximum response (91 mL H2 g−1 COD or 102 mL H2 g−1 VS). No CH4 was detected under these conditions. However note, the H2 yield is comparable to reported values range from 39 to 112 mL H2 g−1 VSadded for mixed anaerobic cultures fed food waste [23,51–53]."
13,Soluble metabolites profile,"3.3 Soluble metabolites profile The production of several short chain fatty acids and alcohols was observed during the fermentation of food waste and PCW steam exploded liquor (Fig. 6 ). Acetate and butyrate were the major metabolites in the untreated cultures and those treated with LA. In both cultures, the dominant pathway was acetate fermentation. Under low COD levels and at high pH, formate was detected in both cultures. Lactate, the second major byproduct, and ethanol were observed in cultures maintained at pH 4.5 and 5.5 (Fig. 6). No significant quantities of lactate were observed in cultures maintained at pH 6.5."
14,Principal component analysis,"3.4 Principal component analysis A principal component analysis (PCA) was used to assess similarities and differences in the outcomes for the experimental conditions (Table 2). The biplot (Fig. 7 ) shows both the loadings and the scores for the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2). The soluble metabolites (VFAs and alcohols) produced during glucose degradation were used as inputs for the PCA. The data set consisted of eight variables (H2, CH4, acetic acid, butyric acid, propionic acid, formic acid, lactic acid and ethanol) and 13 cases (13 experimental conditions shown in Table 2). PC 1 and PC 2 accounted for 60% of the total variability in the data set. Based on the loading values, PC 1 was associated with lactic acid (0.87), ethanol (0.83), propionic acid (0.70) and acetic acid (0.55) while PC 2 was aligned to H2 (0.87), acetic acid (0.72), butyric acid (0.53), lactic acid (0.35), and formate (0.26). The loading values (in parentheses) provide an indication of the contribution of each variable to the PCs (Fig. 7). The PC plot shows cultures at the same initial pH tend to form a cluster. This trend highlights the impact of pH on the degradation of chemicals in a liquor derived from an FW and PCW blend. Cultures at an initial pH of 5.5 were linked to acetate and butyrate production while formate was closely associated with cultures at an initial pH of 6.5 (Fig. 7). Notice the initial pH exhibited the greatest influence on the byproducts distribution. Evidence supporting the importance of pH on the performance of mixed anaerobic H2-producing cultures has been reported by Chaganti et al. [16]. Cultures grouped together at pH 5.5 conditions are associated with H2 production while the CH4 vector is linked with cultures at elevated pH of 6.5 and 7.5."
15,Microbial analysis,"3.5 Microbial analysis T-RFLP characterization was conducted on microbial communities for all experimental conditions (Table 2). In the T-RFLP profile of the 16S rRNA gene polymorphisms only bands with greater than 100 arbitrary fluorescence units were included in the analyses. The variation in the dominant microbial species reflects differences in the fermentation type and the byproduct distribution profile [33]. To quantify the similarities and general relationships between the microbial populations based on the T-RFLP variation, the Kulczynski similarity index was used to generate a cluster tree (Fig. 8 ). A dendrogram is an agglomerative technique which is created from individual samples. Based on the conditions examined, four similar microbial clusters are shown in the dendrogram (Table 2 and Fig. 8). In Clade I, all the LA treated samples at an initial pH of 5.5 were clustered together and linked to H2, acetate and butyrate production (Figs. 7 and 8). Interestingly, a maximum H2 yield was associated with the Clade I group. Even though the LA fed (2 g L−1) cultures were maintained at an initial pH of 5.5 and fed 5 g COD L−1 in comparison to the controls without LA, they exhibited the greatest variation in microbial population (Fig. 8). This suggests the LA concentration played a role in regulating the microbial diversity. Notice increasing the COD concentration from 5–10 g L−1 increased the H2-producing populations and decreased the methanogenic population. In Clade I, controls fed 10 g COD L−1 were closely clustered to the LA treated cultures when compared to the control cultures fed 5 g COD L−1 (Fig. 7). In the similarity tree, cultures at an initial pH of 4.5 were associated with Clade II. In Clade II, the low levels of H2 or CH4 was likely attributed to the inhibition of the both methanogens and H2 producers. All cultures grouped in Clade III were maintained at an initial pH of 6.5. Cultures treated with 1 g L−1 LA and fed 10 g COD L−1 had the least microbial diversity, yet they produced approximately 73 mL H2 g−1 COD. This observation indicates the LA and COD concentration affected the culture in a similar manner as the initial pH. Even though this culture produced 73 mL H2 g−1 COD, it was not grouped in Clade I. Cultures treated with 1 g L−1 LA were clustered in Clade IV. Similarities between the cultures could be attributed to the combined effect of pH plus the LA concentration and COD concentration. Cultures at initial pH of 4.5 and 6.5 were clustered into two groups within Clade IV (Fig. 6) irrespective of COD concentration (5 g L−1 and 10 g L−1 COD). These results demonstrate the influence of pH on the microbial diversity was greater than the COD concentration within the range of the factor levels. Note Clades III and IV were the only clusters associated with formate production (Figs. 7 and 8). The similarity index indicates the conditions in Clade I were 55–75% similar while those in Clade II had a similarity index of 50–55%. In contrast, the similarity index for Clade IV was 50–75% and for Clade III the index range was 72–75%. The cophenetic correlation coefficient of 0.78 suggests a relatively rather good statistical agreement between the dendrogram clusters and the similarity matrix. The coefficient determines how well the dendrogram represents the similarity pattern for the clusters. A dendrogram which provided a perfect representation of the data would yield a cophenetic correlation value of 1. In practice, a perfect representation is never achieved and in microbiological studies, the values are expected to range between 0.6 and 0.9 [54]. Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium novyi, Clostridium pasteurianum, Clostridium spiroforme, Clostridium histolyticum, Clostridium limosum, dominated Clade I. Clostridium sp. is an active H2 producer [33] via acetate and butyrate production pathways. In addition to Clostridium sp., Enterococcus asini, Enterococcus faecalis, and Lactobacillus gallinarum were also present in cultures at pH 5.5 with and without LA. The Clade I group was associated with elevated H2 producers (Figs. 2 and 7); however, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and homoacetogens dominated the Clade II cluster. LAB and homoacetogens (Eubacterium saphenum, Moorella thermoacetica) were also dominant in the control cultures. In comparison to the LA treated cultures, elevated acetate levels in the controls was due to the presence of homoacetogens (Fig. 6). Even though H2 was not observed in cultures maintained at pH 4.5, the acetate detected was likely due to H2 consumption by homoacetogens. Similar observations were reported by Chaganti et al. [55] and Dinamarca et al. [56]. They reported acetate production by homoacetogens in mixed cultures fed glucose or a mixture containing glucose plus xylose. Clade III cultures grown at pH 6.5 were dominated by Clostridium sp. For cultures at an initial pH of 6.5, the band intensity associated with Lactobacillus sp. and Enterococcus sp. (Clade III) was very low when compared to cultures grown at pH 5.5 and 4.5. These results show each individual factor as well as the interaction terms affected the microbial growth of selected microorganisms and the distribution of metabolic byproducts."
16,Conclusions,"This study examined the impact of several process parameters on H2 production from a simulated FW plus PCW using a BBD approach. The results revealed that pH, LA concentration and the COD concentration and their interactions influenced H2 and CH4 production. The model accuracy was supported by the predicted value (91 mL g−1 COD) closer to the maximum experimental H2 yield (87 mL g−1 COD) under optimum conditions of 1.6 g L−1 LA, an initial pH of 5.93 and an initial COD of 9.34 g COD L−1. Adding LA eliminated the methanogenic population, reduced the quantity of LAB and enhanced the Clostridium sp. population. Clostridium sp., E. asini, E. faecalis, and L. gallinarum were the major microbial population detected in cultures at pH 5.5 with and without LA. Lactate production under low pH conditions was associated with Lactobacillus and Enterococcus spp. The T-RFs analyses showed that a combination of pH, LA concentration and COD concentration selected an H2-producing culture. Using steam exploded paper waste to produce H2 is not feasible because of the low COD content in the liquor. The results strongly suggest that a combination of paper plus food waste is a suitable raw material feed for H2 production. Hence, MSW can be evaluated for producing H2 in the pilot-scale fermenters."
