0,Introduction,"Recently, renewable fuel from lignocellulosic biomass has garnered attention due to its environmental and potential economic benefits over crude oil [1]. Though ethanol is currently the dominant biofuel as a blend component to gasoline, several properties make ethanol undesirable as standalone transportation fuel (e.g., low energy density and high water solubility). Alcohols can be produced from biomass via thermochemical [2] and biological routes [3]. For example, methanol and higher alcohols can be generated via synthesis gas route from biomass through thermochemical route [4]. Ethanol and butanol can be generated through biomass fermentation processes [5,6]. The production capacity of ethanol and butanol in the United States is projected to rise beyond current blending needs due to an Energy Independence and Security Act requirement that 36 billion gallon of biofuels be produced annually by 2022 [7]. Thus, the production of high-value and high-energy-content fuel-range hydrocarbons generated from alcohol is of great interest. Along with the development of ZSM-5 synthesis, Exxon-Mobil's discovery of the methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) process in 1970s triggered lots of interest in research and development arena to understand the reaction mechanisms of alcohols over zeolites, especially ZSM-5 [8]. A commercial MTG plant in New Zealand was used to generate gasoline in the 1980s and operated until crude oil prices dropped in the early 1990s [9]. In MTG process, the conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons and water is complete and stoichiometric when the catalyst is active. So all the oxygen removed from alcohol is in the form of water, which gives close to 100 percent of the carbon yield to hydrocarbon products. The shape-selective HZSM-5 catalyst limits the product composition to around a chain length of 12 carbons. Using HZSM-5 catalyst and varying the catalyst compositions and process conditions, methanol can be converted into light olefins, gasoline and diesel-range hydrocarbons [10]. In the last 40 years, several different detailed reaction mechanisms have been proposed for gasoline-range hydrocarbon formation from methanol over zeolite catalysts. Recently, Bjørgen et al. [11,12] studied the retained material on the spent zeolite catalyst from methanol conversion and they proposed an indirect hydrocarbon pool mechanism where methanol dehydrates to form equilibrium between methanol, dimethyl ether and water. Concurrently, cyclic organic species are formed in the cages and channels of the zeolite catalyst. Next, the equilibrium product reacts with cyclic organic species trapped inside the zeolite, giving a charged organic-inorganic hybrid that then loses smaller olefins, while giving back the same (or a similar) hydrocarbon. Finally, the small olefins can undergo further complex network of reactions (e.g., oligomerization, dehydrocyclization and hydrogenation) to form hydrocarbons in the gasoline range. Johansson et al. [13] compared the product composition and the retained material on the spent zeolite catalyst between methanol and ethanol conversions over HZSM-5 and they concluded that both methanol and ethanol go through similar reaction mechanism to form hydrocarbons in gasoline range. The conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons over HZSM-5 catalyst is well represented by the simplified reaction mechanism shown in Scheme 1 . Methanol follows an intermolecular dehydration pathway to form dimethyl ether before forming the olefin. The olefin goes through oligomerization, dehydrocylization and hydrogenation reactions to form a complex mixture of gasoline-range hydrocarbons. The conversion of ethanol to hydrocarbons over HZSM-5 is well represented by the simplified reaction mechanism shown in Scheme 2 . Unlike methanol, ethanol goes through intramolecular dehydration to form ethylene in a single step. Then, ethanol follows a reaction network similar to that of methanol to form a complex mixture of gasoline-range hydrocarbons. 1-proponal and 1-butanol can be represented by the same simplified reaction mechanism as ethanol, except those compounds form propylene and 1-butylene, respectively, from intramolecular dehydration reaction step, which is followed by the same sequence of reaction mechanisms as ethanol to form higher hydrocarbons. As shown in Table 1 , the theoretical hydrocarbon yield generated from the alcohol dehydration process varied based on alcohol carbon number or carbon to oxygen ratio. The larger the alcohol chain length, greater the theoretical hydrocarbon yield. For example, the theoretical mass yield of hydrocarbon for methanol is ∼0.44 ghydrocarbon/gmethanol compared with ∼0.61, ∼0.70 and ∼0.76 for ethanol, 1-propanol and 1-butanol, respectively. For several reasons, when converting alcohol to fuel-range hydrocarbons using HZSM-5 catalyst, higher alcohols (e.g., ethanol, 1-propanol and 1-butanol) are preferable over methanol. Methanol conversion over HZSM-5 catalyst produces high percentages of durene (i.e., 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene) and benzene. Durene is undesirable in transportation fuel due to its high melting point (79.2 °C), which causes it to solidify at room temperature. Benzene is an environmentally controlled substance due to its carcinogenic nature. Thus, benzene and durene are not tolerated in transportation fuels. In addition, higher alcohols release less water through dehydration than methanol because they have a higher ratio of hydrogen to oxygen. More detailed research on methanol conversion was reported [14] and, recently, similar research reported on ethanol [13] and other alcohols [15,16]. However, a comprehensive comparison of catalyst activity and deactivation mechanisms associated with the conversion of various alcohols over zeolites has not been reported. In this work, experiments were conducted on methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol and 1-butanol over HZSM-5 catalyst under MTG-reaction conditions. The experimental results on the catalyst activity and deactivation mechanisms were discussed."
1,Experimental,"ZSM-5 (CBV3024 E) catalyst with silica to alumina ratio of 30 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 30) in ammonium form was acquired from Zeolyst Inc. Before testing, the powder catalyst was pelletized and sieved to 60–100 mesh homogenous particles. After sizing, the catalyst was calcined at 500 °C for 4 h in air to convert the ammonium form of the catalyst to proton form and to burn off impurities carried over from zeolite catalyst synthesis or from treatment and handling processes. Catalyst testing experiments were carried out in a continuous fixed-bed, down-flow 3/8 inch stainless tube reactor (7.75 mm internal diameter). The experiments were conducted at 360 °C and 300 psig pressure under nitrogen environment. The process flow diagram of the experimental setup is shown in Figure 1 . The reactor setup was equipped to collect condensed liquid samples under pressurized conditions without disturbing the state of the reaction. The nitrogen carrier gas flow was kept constant at ∼12.5 mL/min throughout the experiment. The catalyst was packed in the middle of the reactor between thin layers of glass wool. Once reaction conditions were established, the alcohol feed started at a flow rate of 0.05 mL/min and was maintained weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of around 4.8±0.06 h−1. There was a minor difference in WHSVs due to the small variation in density between the alcohols tested. The product liquid and gas samples were collected at frequent intervals for analysis. The gas analysis was conducted using a Carle gas chromatogram equipped with thermal conductivity detector. The organic portion of the liquid sample was analyzed using an Agilent gas chromatogram/mass spectrometer and the aqueous phase of the liquid sample was analyzed using a Waters liquid chromatogram equipped with a refractive index detector. Spent catalysts were recovered at the end of each experiment following reactor cool-down to room temperature. Coke/carbonaceous deposits on the spent catalysts were determined by complete combustion (i.e., temperature programmed oxidation) under a helium and oxygen environment using a NETZSCH thermogravimetric analyzer."
2,Results and discussion,"Figure 2 shows the conversion of ethanol, liquid hydrocarbon yield and ethylene selectivity over HZSM-5 catalyst against time-on-stream (TOS). Throughout the duration of the experiment, ethanol conversion remained close to 100 percent. Initially, the liquid hydrocarbon yield was lower and the ethylene selectivity was higher before the reaction reached a steady state. This phenomenon, termed the hydrocarbon pool mechanism by Kolbe et al. [11,12,17,18], results from the required initial induction period wherein radicals or co-catalysts known as organic-inorganic hybrids are formed to sustain continued higher hydrocarbon generation. In the later stage of the catalyst's lifetime, liquid hydrocarbon production started to decline and ethylene selectivity increased. The decrease in liquid hydrocarbon is due to the combination of active site poisoning and pore blockage from products with higher molecular weights. Nearly complete conversion of ethanol to ethylene is attained even after the catalyst deactivation for liquid hydrocarbon. This phenomenon shows that the primary dehydration reaction and the secondary reactions require different active sites and/or catalyst acid strengths. Ethanol dehydration occurs on the weakly acid site. Thus, the coke or carbonaceous deposition on the strong acid sites does not affect ethanol dehydration as long as there is residual acidity [19,20]. However, for ethanol, the subsequent reactions (e.g., oligomerization, dehydrocyclization and hydrogenation) occur on the comparatively higher acid strength sites. Thus, the effect of coke deposition or TOS is more pronounced on the liquid hydrocarbon generation and the product class distribution. Figure 3 shows the liquid hydrocarbon yields generated at various TOS for methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol and 1-butanol. Based on TOS, the catalytic activity for ethanol conversion to liquid hydrocarbon dropped faster, followed by methanol, 1-propanol and 1-butanol, respectively. Similar catalytic activity between methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol over HZSM-5 was reported by Mentzel et al. [15]. In addition, Gujar et al. [16] studied alcohol conversion in batch reactor setup over HZSM-5 catalyst and they concluded that higher alcohols generate more liquid-range hydrocarbons. Figure 4 shows the product class distribution of the liquid hydrocarbon sample collected at 2 h TOS from the conversion of methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol and 1-butanol. For all the alcohols, the product class distribution between paraffin, olefin, naphthene, aromatic and naphthalene compounds for samples collected at 2 h TOS were very similar. The biggest difference was in the yield of the liquid hydrocarbon generated. The smaller alcohols tend to generate higher gas fractions in LPG range that are not condensable at room temperature. This is a main reason for the difference in liquid hydrocarbon yields between the alcohols in the early stages of the experiment. Figure 5 shows the product class distribution of the liquid hydrocarbon samples collected at 24 h TOS from the conversion of methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol and 1-butanol. In all cases, the distribution between the product class changed for 24 h TOS samples compared with 2 h TOS samples. The main differences are a decrease in aromatic and naphthalene composition and an increase in the olefin, naphthene and paraffin compounds at 24 h TOS compared with 2 h TOS. Figure 6 shows the weight loss of the spent catalyst collected at 24 h TOS by the thermogravimetric (temperature programmed oxidation) analysis for methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol and 1-butanol. The weight loss of coke and carbonaceous deposits on the spent catalyst showed a linear trend with respect to the alcohol carbon number. The spent catalysts from the methanol and 1-butanol experiments lost around 4.9 and 8.9 percent of their total weights, respectively. This shows that the higher catalytic activity for 1-propanol and 1-butanol conversion, compared with methanol and ethanol, is not directly related to the deposition of the amount of coke/carbonaceous compounds in HZSM-5 catalyst. To confirm that conclusion, the experiments were conducted on the feed switch between the alcohols at strategic intervals without modifying other operating parameters. Figure 7 shows the liquid hydrocarbon yield versus TOS for methanol and 1-propanol. The feed was switched from methanol to 1-propanol after the catalyst showed deactivation signs for methanol. Figure 8 shows the liquid hydrocarbon yield versus TOS for ethanol and 1-propanol. The feed was switched from ethanol to 1-propanol after the catalyst showed deactivation signs for ethanol. For both cases, the catalyst activity and the liquid hydrocarbon yield for 1-proponal reached a similar level to that of 1-propanol alone experiment (see Figure 3) even though the catalyst was deactivated for methanol and ethanol conversion to liquid hydrocarbon. To show that the coke deposits on the catalyst from 1-propanol conversion were the similar to those of methanol and ethanol deactivation, an experiment was conducted using 1-propanol followed by a switch to ethanol. Figure 9 shows the liquid hydrocarbon yield versus TOS for 1-propanol and ethanol. The feed switch was performed at 40 h TOS. This TOS was selected based on the earlier experiment (see Figure 3) with ethanol alone, where the catalyst showed deactivation signs for the liquid hydrocarbon yield around 30 h TOS under similar operating conditions. After the feed was switched from 1-propanol to ethanol, the liquid hydrocarbon yield dropped dramatically. Based on these feed switch experiments and on the weight loss measurements of spent catalysts for individual feed experiments, we can conclude that the variation in catalytic activity between the alcohols is not primarily due to the coke or carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst. Nayak et al. [20] studied the conversion of alcohols and olefins to aromatics by selectively poisoning the stronger acid sites on HZSM-5 catalyst to identify the responsible active sites for aromatization (dehydrocyclization) reaction. They concluded that the primary reactions involved in the conversion of alcohol to lower hydrocarbons can occur on weaker sites, but the aromatization of olefins requires strong acid sites. van den Berg et al. [21] studied the oligomerization of small olefins on HZSM-5 catalyst. They concluded that in ethylene oligomerization, the required activation energy for the formation of ethyl cation is about 120 kJ/mol and that, the activation energy for the formation of propyl cation in propylene oligomerization is about 70–80 kJ/mol. The difference in the rate of oligomerization between ethylene and propylene can be explained by considering that in ethylene oligomerization a primary cation is involved in every consecutive oligomerization step, while in propylene oligomerization, linear paraffins can be formed by consecutive oligomerization involving only secondary and tertiary cations (which are at least 40–50 kJ/mol lower in activation energy than the primary cations mentioned in ethylene oligomerization). The routes for the formation of ethyl and propyl cations in ethylene and propylene oligomerization are shown in Schemes 3 and 4 [21–23]. Based on the experimental results presented here and studies found in the literature, we propose a reaction mechanism to explain the catalytic activity of HZSM-5 catalyst on alcohols at later stage of the catalyst lifetime (shown in Schemes 5 and 6 ). In Scheme 5, the simplified reaction mechanism is shown for ethanol conversion over HZSM-5 at later stage of the catalyst TOS. This mechanism can be extended to methanol as well. For methanol and ethanol, the liquid hydrocarbon yield drops once the strong active sites are poisoned or blocked by coke/carbonaceous deposits, because the oligomerization of smaller olefins and the dehydrocyclization require strong active sites (higher activation energy). In Scheme 6, the simplified reaction mechanism is shown for 1-propanol conversion over HZSM-5 at later stage of the catalyst TOS. This mechanism can be extended to 1-butanol as well. For 1-propanol and 1-butanol, the activity for the liquid hydrocarbon is longer; however, the product distribution is mainly composed of higher olefinic compounds in later stage of the catalyst lifetime. This can be explained that the oligomerization of propylene and 1-butylene requires comparatively weaker acid sites (low activation energy). So, even after the stronger active sites responsible for dehydrocyclization deactivate, oligomerization continues to form liquid-range hydrocarbons."
3,Conclusions,"Acid site strength plays a major role in the product class distribution and the catalyst life in the transformation of alcohols to hydrocarbon. The catalyst lifetime is longer for 1-propanol and 1-butanol, primarily due to the low activation energy requirements for the oligomerization of the respective dehydration products compared with dehydration products from methanol and ethanol. 1-propanol and 1-butanol primarily generate olefin-rich compounds, which can be hydrogenate to produce high-value jet-fuel-range paraffin hydrocarbons."
