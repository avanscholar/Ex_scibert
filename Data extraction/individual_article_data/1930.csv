0,Introduction,"Bacterial hydrogen production from organic materials soluble in water occurs through dark fermentation and photofermentation, in which carbohydrates are converted to bio-hydrogen by fermentative bacteria or photosynthetic bacteria. The major drawback of dark fermentation is the low H2 gas yield. The stoichiometric ratio of hydrogen gas formation from glucose is 12 mol-H2 per mole-glucose. However, current fermentation techniques can yield only 2–3 mol-H2 per mole-glucose, mainly due to H2 consumption by methanogenic bacteria [1,2]. In photofermentation process, there is an increase in the overall hydrogen yield. However, the requirement of light complicates the reactor design and makes large-scale application impractical [3–5]. A third technique for bio‑hydrogen production from organic matter, including wastewater, is known as a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) and was first described in 2005 [6]. This process occurs in a device similar to that of the microbial fuel cell (MFC) [7]. MEC is an electrolytic process which requires extra potential, while MFC is a galvanic process that produces electricity. The MEC is comprised of a single or dual-glass chamber separated by a proton-exchange membrane. The anode chamber contains exoelectrogenic bacterial cells which oxidize organic material to electrons and protons which recombines on the cathode to bio‑hydrogen. However, since the overall free energy of this process is positive, the MEC device operates under low external voltage. This process typically requires a voltage of about 0.15–0.8 V, which is much lower than the theoretical and practical values of 1.5 and above in water electrolysis [4,6]. The most widely reported catalyst in MEC cathodes is platinum (Pt) [4,8,9]. However, there are some disadvantages to using platinum, including its high cost and high sensitivity to poisoning by adsorption of various organic and inorganic molecules, that shift the cathodic potential to more negative values which result in decreased HER [10]. One of the most challenging processes in MEC technology is finding an active, low cost catalyst that can replace Pt. Possible alternative catalysts to Pt are nickel and stainless steel, due to their low cost and low overpotentials. For example, the following catalysts have been reported: stainless steel (SS) A286 and Nickel 625 [11], stainless steel brush cathodes [12], SS mesh cathodes [13], NiMo and NiW on a carbon-fiber-weaved cloth [14] and Ni foam [15]. An alternative for the cathodes based on transition metals are bio-cathodes with mixed microbial consortia [16]. Based on the density functional theory calculations it was found that hydrogen adsorption energy of MoS2 and exchange current density was close to that of Pt catalytic surface [17] [18]. The successful use of MoS2 as a catalyst for nitrogenase inspired the researchers to use it as a catalyst in MEC [17]. HER in MEC using MoS2 was firstly performed by Tokash and Logan [19]. However, MoS2 has an insufficient number of active sites as well as low conductivity [20]. To overcome these disadvantages, Lukowski et al. synthetized MoS2 by chemical exfoliation method and reported a significant enhancement of the charge transfer kinetics of 1T-MoS2 exfoliated nanosheets supported on graphite surface. They attribute the observed low over-potential of HER to the metallic characteristic of MoS2 resulting in low electronic transport as well as higher density of accessible catalytic sites [21]. Optimizing MoS2 catalytic activity was also demonstrated using electrochemical intercalation of Li+ ions in between the MoS2 layers using controlled potential and lithium charge accumulation to vary the interlayer separation distance, Mo oxidation stat and electronic parameters. Tuning these properties was found to have strong influence on HER activity [22]. Li et al. synthetize MoS2 nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets using a selective solvothermal method. The hybrid MoS2/rGO nanoscopic material possessed a structure of few-layers of MoS2 with a high number of exposed edges stacked onto the graphene and exhibit very low Tafel slops for HER [23]. Yuan et al. coated MoS2 on multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and demonstrated enhancement of HER activity while the content of CNT was increased. The results suggest that conductivity may be the main limiting factor for overall HER catalysis by MoS2 [24]. The MoS2 catalyst showed better performance than the SS cathode in hydrogen reduction under neutral pH conditions [25]. MoS2 is a cost-effective, highly chemically stable, nontoxic, layered material that is most suitable for long-term use in MEC. In this study, a molybdenum di-sulfide (MoS2) catalyst was synthetized using the chemically exfoliation method (MoS2-EF). The catalyst was chemically, electrochemically and physically characterized. The hydrogen evolution rate was examined in a MEC based on a Geobacter sulfurreducens anode. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that nano-particles of MoS2 in a MEC for hydrogen production."
1,Methods,
2,MoS2 catalyst synthesis,"2.1 MoS2 catalyst synthesis MoS2 synthesis was carried out by lithium intercalation according to a published exfoliation method. The synthetized MoS2 is designated as MoS2-EF [26]. Pristine MoS2 powder (0.5 g) and 5 mL of 1.6 M butyllithium (C4H9Li) (molar ratio of 1:3) were immersed in hexane and stirred for 48 h in a 100 mL 2-neck flask under a N2 atmosphere. The resulting LixMoS2 suspension was gravity-filtered under N2, and the solid was washed with ~100 mL of hexane and then isolated to a diluted slurry, followed by transferring to a 50 mL round-bottom flask and sealed with a septum. The paste was dried with N2 to remove residual hexane and then quickly quenched with 30 mL of a 1 M HCl solution. The slurry LixMoS2 was exposed to high-power ultrasonication (VCX-130, Sonics & Materials) for 1 h, at 130 W."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The catalysts were characterized using a JEOL JSM-6510L scanning electron microscope (SEM), whereas the elemental composition of the catalysts was analyzed using energy dispersive spectra (EDS) NORAN SS7 and mapping by an Oxford INCA-400 spectrometer installed on the SEM. The size of the catalyst particles was measured using Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) (Sympatec nanophox, Germany). The horn intensity was adjusted for counting of 2000–3000 particles. The crystalline structure of the catalyst samples was identified using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, using a PANalytical X'Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) for 9 h at 2°Θ = 10°–140°."
4,Characteristic Raman spectrum of the catalyst,"2.3 Characteristic Raman spectrum of the catalyst A slurry of MoS2-EF as well as the pristine MoS2 were sonicated for 15 min and drop-casted on a poly-l-lysine coating MICA slide (Grade V-4, 15 × 15 × 0.15 mm, SPI Chem, USA). Slides were measured immediately after being dried. The samples were analyzed using an Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) (Nanonics Inc., USA) equipped with a Multiview 2000 head mounted on a K-minus optical table. Scanning was done in tapping mode using a chromium 20 nm diameter tip (Nanonics Supertips, Ltd., USA). Raman measurements were performed using the XPLORA ONE micro-Raman system (Horiba Scientific, France) using a 532 nm laser, 1200 lines/mm grating, power <150 mW [27,28]."
5,Electrochemical characterization,"2.4 Electrochemical characterization 2.4.1 LSV-RDE Electrochemical measurements were performed in a standard three-electrode glass cell equipped with a Pt-wire counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl (Metrohm) reference electrode as described in our previous paper [29]. The working electrode was a 5 mm diameter glassy‑carbon disk surrounded by a Pt concentric ring (PINE instruments). The catalysts, pristine MoS2, MoS2-EF and Pt, were deposited on the center disk from a homogeneous suspension consisting of catalyst powder (70 wt%), Nafion solution (15 wt%, Ion Power), XC72 carbon black (15 wt%, Cabot) dissolved in water and isopropyl alcohol. The final catalyst loading was 50 μg cm−2. The RDE measurements were performed in 0.5 M H2SO4 and PB pH = 7 saturated with pure nitrogen."
6,Bacterial strain,"2.5 Bacterial strain A pure culture of Geobacter sulfurreducens (DSMZ 12127) was grown on Geobacter medium (826. Geobacter Medium, DSMZ) in a sealed medium bottle at 30 °C with agitation of 100 RPM. After about 10 days, the bottom of the bottle was covered with red aggregates of bacterial cells. A fraction enriched with the aggregates was inoculated to the MEC anode chamber."
7,MEC set-up,"2.6 MEC set-up The MEC consisted of a dual-glass chamber (Adams & Chittenden Scientific Glass, USA) separated by a proton-selective membrane (Nafion 115, Ion Power). The anode chamber contained 250 mL of 75% Geobacter medium (N′ 826, DSMZ Germany) and 25% PB final concentration of 100 mM, pH 6.8. This chamber contained a carbon cloth (CC) anode (2 cm × 4 cm) (E-TEK W1400 LT, USA) and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (CH Instruments). The cathode chamber contained 250 mL of PB 100 mM pH 6.8, and a carbon cloth (ELAT-LT-1400 W, ETEK International) counter electrode (2 cm × 2 cm) brush-coated with pristine MoS2 or Pt (Johnson Matthey) catalysts to form a layer of 0.5 mg cm−2. The catalyst layer was prepared from an ink containing a weight ratio of 8:1:1 catalyst:Nafion [5% (w/w) solution, Ion Power]:carbon (Vulcan XC72, Cabot). (The preparation of the electrode with the synthetized MoS2-EF catalyst is described in a separate paragraph). The cathode chamber includes an opening for a gas collection bag (cali-5-bond Calibrated Instruments, USA). The MEC was placed in a thermostatic bath at 30 °C and a constant potential of 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 V (versus an Ag/AgCl reference electrode) was applied using a computer driven potentiostat (Ivium n-stat, The Netherlands)."
8,Pretreatment of the CC cathode using cold nitrogen plasma for the adherence of the MoS2-EF catalyst,"2.7 Pretreatment of the CC cathode using cold nitrogen plasma for the adherence of the MoS2-EF catalyst The CC anode was pretreated using cold nitrogen plasma, in order to increase the adherence of the fine slurry MoS2-EF to the anode surface [30]. Nitrogen plasma treatment of the carbon CC (2 × 2 cm) was performed in a Harrick PDC-32G, USA plasma system. The CC was introduced into the plasma chamber (RF of 60 Hz) during a set time. The chamber pressure and plasma power were maintained at 2 Torr and 18 W, respectively. The hydrophobicity of the cathode surface was determined by measuring a static contact angle of a sessile drop (5 μL deionized water) using a remote-computer controlled goniometer system (Rame'-Hart Instrument Co., NJ, USA)."
9,GC analysis,"2.8 GC analysis The hydrogen was collected in a gas sampling bag (50 mL), Cali-5-Bond, Calibrated Instruments, USA. The hydrogen purity was determined by a gas chromatography (GC), 6100 GC Young Lin Instrument, using a thermal conductivity detector (TDC) at 150 °C under Argon as a gas carrier, at a volumetric flow rate of 20 mL min−1."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Physical and chemical characterization of the synthetized MoS2-EF,"3.1 Physical and chemical characterization of the synthetized MoS2-EF In this study, nanoparticles of MoS2 were synthesized using exfoliation process followed by high power ultrasonication (MoS2-EF) [26]. Commercial MoS2 powder and BuLi in the presence of hexane were stirred in a N2 atmosphere. The resulting suspension was filtered and the solid washed with hexane. The obtained diluted slurry was dried, quickly quenched with acidic water and sonicated to reduce particles size. The elemental compositions of the MoS2-EF catalyst surface was analyzed by energy dispersive spectra (EDS) and showed that the atomic ratio of the MoS2-EF catalyst is 71% ± 1 (S) and 29% ± 1 (Mo) and compared to the pristine MoS2 which is 69% ± 1 (S) and 31% ± 1 (Mo). This result is in agreement with the expected MoS2 stoichiometry and in support of no side reactions (e.g. formation of MoO2). The XRD analysis shows one main diffraction peak of 14.40 (°2θ) and 14.38 (°2θ) attributed to the (002) plane of MoS2-EF and the pristine MoS2, respectively (Fig. 1A). Additional diffraction peaks of hexagonal MoS2 are assigned to (008), (103), (105), (106) and (110) (Reference pattern: 01-077-1716). Similar results were obtained by Patil et al. [31]. Our results show that the main peak of MoS2-EF becomes weaker and broader than the pristine MoS2, which means that the MoS2 exfoliation process led to the formation of smaller particles with lower crystallinity. Analysis of the sensitized electrocatalyst particle size was carried out using the dynamic light scattering (DLS) method. The size of the MoS2-EF particles is 200 ± 50 nm (Fig. 1B), which is 50-fold smaller than the particle size of the pristine catalyst MoS2. The pristine MoS2 catalyst particles are composed of two size populations: 5000–10,000 nm and 1000–2000 nm. It should be noted that particles of larger diameter tend to precipitate and therefore cannot be detected by DLS."
12,AFM and Raman analysis the synthetized MoS2-EF,"3.2 AFM and Raman analysis the synthetized MoS2-EF Fig. 2(A, 1–3) shows a flake-like elliptical shape in the AFM imaging of pristine MoS2 with a typical diameter of 2000–4000 nm and a height <500 nm, while the size of the MoS2-EF particles are irregular shape of about 100 nm in size with a height of <20 nm (Fig. 2B–D). Raman chemical analysis was applied to pristine MoS2 as well as to MoS2-EF surface for potential chemical modification. The Raman spectrum of MoS2-EF is shown in Fig. 3 , and clearly displays the E 1 2g and A 1g peaks at 373 cm−1 and 399 cm−1, respectively. Similar result was obtained for the pristine MoS2. The two peaks can be regarded as the fingerprint of MoS2 [32–34] and our spectral study serves as a validation of the preparation method and purity of MoS2-EF which was used in the electrode."
13,Electrochemical characterization,"3.3 Electrochemical characterization The electrochemical study of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on pristine MoS2 and on the MoS2-EF was studied first by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and compared to the state-of-the-art of Pt catalyst in acid solution in standard acid solution. The catalysts (50 μg cm−2) were loaded on 0.196 cm2 glassy carbon electrode and LSV measurements were applied (Fig. 4 ). The use of RDE prevents the formation of large hydrogen gas bubbles on the electrode surface, which may block the catalyst reaction. The reaction was examined under favorable conditions of a strong acidic electrolyte solution. The onset potential which was calculated at 5% from the maximum current was −0.260, −0.263 and −0.256 V in the MoS2-EF, pristine MoS2 and Pt, respectively. The measured current densities at a potential of −0.45 V vs Ag/AgCl of the MoS2-EF, pristine MoS2 and Pt, in H2SO4 were 10.87, 10.40 and 36.22 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. 4). In addition, it can be seen that the over-potential needed to begin the HER by the two MoS2 catalysts is very similar to the Pt catalyst. However, the current density of Pt was >3-fold higher than that of the two MoS2 catalysts. At low potentials (below −0.36 V), the HER on Pt occurs with an over-potential of 60 mV, which is considered to be low compared to similar MoS2 catalysts reported in acid solution which are higher than 100 mV [35,36]. LSV-RDE measurements were also performed in 0.05 M PB, pH-7 in order to examine the catalyst electrochemical activity in a MEC relevant medium (Fig. 5 ). Again, the onset potential of the three electrodes was very similar: −0.837, −0.832 and −0.755 V in the MoS2-EF, pristine MoS2 and Pt, respectively, while the measured current densities at a potential of −0.13 V vs Ag/AgCl of the MoS2-EF, pristine MoS2 and Pt, were 3.93, 3.15 and 7.65 mA cm−2, respectively. These results (Figs. 4 and 5) show that there is a higher current of 0.78 mA cm−2 on the synthesized catalyst MoS2-EF in the PB electrolyte, compared to the pristine MoS2 catalyst. In addition, the Pt current density in 0.5 M H2SO4 is 3.3 times higher than MoS2-EF, while in PB it is only 1.9 times higher. These results suggest that Pt may be a less active catalyst in the PB electrolyte, probably due to the adsorption of phosphate. A reduction in Pt catalyst activity in the presence of phosphate was also observed by Habrioux et al. 2007 [37]. Cost-effective cathode catalysts will increase the feasibility of MEC for wastewater treatment and hydrogen production. MECs based on Pt, pristine MoS2 and stainless steel (SS) showed that biogas production in industrial wastewater after 30 h was about 70, 55 and 40 mL. These results show that pristine MoS2 and stainless steel (SS) may be a compatible alternatives to Pt [25]. Gibbs free energy of adsorbed atomic hydrogen indicates that MoS2 has a high potential of HER catalysis [18]. Also, the density functional theory showed that MoS2 edge site are active for hydrogen evolution. However, at a given time only one in four edges atoms of MoS2 participates in hydrogen evolution [17] and its conductivity is low compared to Pt [20]. The potential of MoS2 for hydrogen evolution and its being cost effective encourage researchers to overcome these disadvantages. A MEC based on conductive carbon nanotubes (CNT) coated with MoS2 as a cathode led to a comparable hydrogen production that was obtained in a MEC based on Pt. The researchers fabricated a material that combines ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets with highly conductive carbon nanotubes which led to increase the number of MoS2 active sites as well as the electric conductivity [24]. It is assumed that the edge plane of each layer provides a catalytic site for hydrogen evolution. Increasing the cathode surface area may thus increase the number of active sites of the catalyst [38]."
14,Improvement the cathode wettability for increasing the adherence of the sensitized MoS2-EF catalyst,"3.4 Improvement the cathode wettability for increasing the adherence of the sensitized MoS2-EF catalyst Conductive carbon materials have been reported to have very weak interaction with MoS2 [39] therefore, it is imperative to develop a method for stabilizing the MoS2-EF on the surface of the carbon cloth (CC) electrode used in the MEC. Post synthesis of MoS2-EF, the exfoliated nano-particles of MoS2 are suspended in the solution, tend to restack upon drying. To overcome the difficulty of binding the MoS2-EF nano-particles, which are in the slurry and not as powder, the carbon cloth anode was activated using cold nitrogen plasma. This process forms positively charges of nitrogen species on surface of the carbon fiber electrode [30,40] strongly adsorbs the negatively charged MoS2-EF without the use of binder as used with Pt in MFC and MEC (typically Nafion®) [41]. Cold nitrogen plasma produces various nitrogen-containing species on treated surfaces, including amines, pyridines and pyrroles. It is known to increase the surface hydrophilicity, micro-porosity, as well as surface area by fine etching [42–45]. A visual inspection of the changes in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties of the pretreated cold nitrogen plasma CC cathode surface was performed using a goniometer (Fig. 6 ) in which the contact angle between a drop of water and the CC electrode surface is measured. A water contact angle of 90–120° defined the surface as hydrophobic, a 90–30° angle as hydrophilic whereas 30–0° defined the very hydrophilic surface. A water droplet was placed over the pristine CC surface and a contact angle of ~130° was measured (Fig. 6A). This result indicated that the pristine CC is a hydrophobic surface. When a water contact angle was measured after cold plasma treatment for 2 min, the contact angel changed to 0°, which is considered as a super-hydrophilic surface (Fig. 6B). The improvement of the carbon electrode surface wettability properties improved the mechanical adherence of MoS2-EF catalysts and provided a stable cathode for the MEC experiments."
15,"Performance of abiotic MECs based on MoS2-EF, pristine MoS2 or Pt cathodes and a sterile anode","3.5 Performance of abiotic MECs based on MoS2-EF, pristine MoS2 or Pt cathodes and a sterile anode The MEC in this study was constructed of dual-glass chambers separated by a proton-selective membrane. The two chambers were filled with medium and buffer as described in the Material and Methods. The CC electrodes (4 cm2) were coated with the catalysts MoS2-EF, pristine MoS2 and Pt (0.5 mg cm−2) and a carbon CC without a catalyst served as a control. LSV polarization was measured in an abiotic MEC under applied voltage of 0–(−1.6) V vs Ag Ag/Cl (Fig. 7 ). The polarization of the cathode-working electrode in an abiotic environment showed that the highest current density and the lowest onset potential was obtained in a MEC based on the Pt electrode. The current densities at −1.3 V in the MEC based on Pt, MoS2-EF and the pristine MoS2 were 17.46, 12.67 and 3.09 mA cm−2, respectively, while on the CC cathode the current density was only 0.445 mA cm−2 (Table 1 ). The same results were obtained with the CC cathode that was treated with cold nitrogen plasma."
16,"Performance of biotic MECs based on MoS2-EF, pristine MoS2 or Pt cathode and a Geobacter sulfurreducens anode","3.6 Performance of biotic MECs based on MoS2-EF, pristine MoS2 or Pt cathode and a Geobacter sulfurreducens anode Hydrogen evolution rates were measured in the biotic MECs based on Pt, MoS2-EF or the pristine MoS2 cathode and a Geobacter sulfurreducens bacterial anode (Eqs. (1) and (2)). The MECs were operated under selected applied constant potential (Table 2 ). The obtained current densities in the MEC based on Pt, MoS2-EF and the pristine MoS2 cathodes were 3.75, 6.00 and 4.75 A cm−2, respectively. In these MECs, the hydrogen evolution rates per cubic meter of the anodic medium were 0.106, 0.133 and 0.083 m3 d−1 m−3, respectively. The hydrogen evolution currents per square meter of electrode were 0.053, 0.067 and 0.042 m3 d−1 m−2, respectively. These results emphasize that under applied voltages of 0.6 V, the MEC based on MoS2-EF led to a higher hydrogen evolution rate compared to Pt and the pristine MoS2 cathodes. These results may be due to the negative effect of the organic molecules on the Pt catalyst. It was previously reported that sulfur compounds and carbon monoxide are poisonous materials for Pt, shifting the cathodic potential to more negative values and resulting in a decreased HER [46]. Molecules produced during bacterial metabolism were reported to negatively affect Pt cathode performance [11]. In perchlorate or phosphate electrolytes, cathodes coated with MoS2 led to superior electrochemical performance compared to the Pt-based cathode. At current densities of 8–10 A m−2, the MoS2 catalyst had an 82 mV smaller HER over-potential than the Pt-based catalyst [19]. We assume that organic molecules such as acetate, amino acids etc. that evolve from the bacterial anode activity or even from lysed dead bacteria can pass the Nafion membrane that separated the two chambers. The mentioned results of other studies and our results show that MoS2-EF can be an alternative to Pt, in biological solutions. Comparison performance parameters of MEC based on MoS2-EF electrode used in this study with earlier studies of MEC based on MoS2 or Pt cathode for hydrogen evaluation are shown in Table 3 . In addition to the better performance of MoS2 compared to Pt in biological solutions, MoS2 was found to be cost effective. The calculated cost of preparing MoS2-EF cathode compared to self-made Pt electrode is shown in Table S-1. MoS2 is 370-fold less expensive then Pt. The cost of preparing electrode covered with 0.5 mg cm−2 MoS2-EF and Pt catalyst is $ 127 and $ 1980, respectively. MoS2 cathode is 16-fold less expensive then Pt cathode.

In addition to the better performance of MoS2 compared to Pt in biological solutions, MoS2 was found to be cost effective.

17,Analysis of the collected hydrogen purity,"3.7 Analysis of the collected hydrogen purity The hydrogen was collected from the MEC and was analyzed to verify its purity by running the collected gas samples in gas chromatography (GC) (Fig. 8 ). Using the TCD detector, it is shown that only one peak appears with a retention time of 1 min, which corresponds to hydrogen. No other gases were detected. This supports the purity of the hydrogen produced and the selectivity of the reduction reaction on MoS2-EF. It was reported that in a single biotic MEC, there was a contamination of methane in addition to the hydrogen generation. However, maintaining a short cycle time under applied voltages (≥0.6 V), the methane gas concentrations was reduced to <4%, but it was not possible to eliminate methanogenesis [48]. Apparently MoS2-EF is more selective towards hydrogen evolution reduction than Pt which is also known to be C-H activation catalyst and therefore can under biotic condition form other products (e.g. CH4). The purity of the hydrogen is critical for the operation of low temperature fuel cells such as PEMFC utilizing H2."
18,Conclusions,"The MoS2-EF catalyst synthesized using the exfoliation method led to the formation of nano-particles with a size of 200 ± 50 nm, 50-fold smaller than the pristine catalyst MoS2. The MoS2-EF Raman spectrum displays the E 1 2g and A 1g peaks at 373 cm−1 and 399 cm−1, the same as that of the pristine MoS2. The electrochemical characterization by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV)-RDE showed that the Pt current density in 0.5 M H2SO4 was 3.3 times higher than MoS2-EF, while in PB it was only 1.9 times higher. These results suggest that Pt may be a less active catalyst in PB electrolyte, probably due to the adsorption of phosphate. The synthetized MoS2-EF catalyst was obtained as a MoS2 dispersion fine slurry, and adhesion of the catalyst to the CC electrode was performed on a cold nitrogen plasma pretreated electrode. The polarization of the cathode-working electrode in an abiotic environment showed that the highest current density and the lowest onset potential was obtained in a MEC based on a Pt electrode. The current densities at −1.3 V in MEC based on Pt, MoS2-EF and the pristine MoS2 were 17.46, 12.67 and 3.09 mA cm−2, respectively. The hydrogen evolution currents per a square meter of electrode were 0.053, 0.067 and 0.042 m3 d−1 m−2, respectively. These results emphasize that under applied voltages of 0.6 V which is significantly lower than the art result in electrolysis (1.5 V), the MEC based on MoS2-EF led to the higher hydrogen evolution rate compared to Pt and the pristine MoS2 cathodes. These results may ascribe to the negative effect of the organic molecules released by the anodic biofilm on the Pt catalyst. The produced hydrogen using MoS2-EF was pure, no other gases were detected. The results in this study show that MoS2-EF can serve as an electrochemical active and cost-effective alternative to the common-used Pt. The following is the supplementary data related to this article. S-1 The cost of preparation Pt and MoS2-EF electrodes.
