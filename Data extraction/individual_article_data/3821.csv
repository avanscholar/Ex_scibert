0,Introduction,"Cost-effective hydrogen production and CO2 capture are required for a hydrogen economy [1]. About 95% of the hydrogen produced in the U.S. is obtained using a thermal process with natural gas as the feedstock. The conventional process primarily consists of two steps [2] namely the reformation of the feedstock with high-temperature steam to obtain a syngas and a water gas shift reaction that produces hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and residual materials. Moreover, the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) technology was utilized to achieve the separation of CO, CO2, CH4, and H2O from H2, allowing hydrogen to be purified to 99.999%. Most of hydrogen production plants using fossil fuels usually generated an amount of CO2, but some of them used CO2 capturing techniques to reduce CO2 emissions. Koumpouras et al. [3] presented the sorption-enhanced reaction process by adding an adsorbent into the reaction system for the selective removal of CO2 in a SMR process. Ortiz et al. [4] investigated an iron waste material as oxygen carrier for a chemical-looping combustion system such that the PSA off-gas was fully converted to CO2and H2O. Martavaltzi et al. [5] showed that CaO−Ca12Al14O33 acted as an effective CO2 sorbent, reducing by 67% the amount of total CO2 that would have been emitted in conventional steam reforming. Nord et al. [6] developed a cycle design for capturing CO2 in a natural gas combined cycle power plant. A high degree of process integration for the pre-combustion CO2 capture can improve the system efficiency but the complexity of the plant increases. In addition, those CO2 separation processes all require additional energy supply. From the viewpoint of CO2 utilization, Song and Pan [7] presented a tri-reforming of methane as a new approach for syngas production. It is an effective conversion of CO2 in the flue gases from electric power plants without CO2 pre-separation, but one of three catalytic reforming reaction processes, autothermal reforming of methane, cannot suppress CO2 formation and other reactions for coke formation are quite obvious. Fan et al. [8] utilized greenhouse gases as the feed of the catalytic carbon dioxide reforming process to improve hourly space velocity and hydrogen production. Fan et al. [9] studied the optimization of hydrogen production from the CO2 reforming of methane. Gao et al. [10] showed that CO2 reforming of hydrocarbons, ethanol, and dimethyl ether (DME) would become a promising way in production of H2-rich syngas. Basically, CDRM is a strongly endothermic reaction and the problems of catalyst deactivation and regeneration should be solved. Recently, Son et al. [11] showed that the specific steam-treated catalysts could reduce coke deposition on reforming reaction. Demidov et al. [12] used the Gibbs energy minimization method to determine the optimized CH4/CO2/H2O molar ratios for minimizing the contents of CH4 and CO2 in syngas. SMR is the most widely applied method of producing syngas using natural gas and steam, and CDRM is an alternative process to produce syngas using natural gas and waste CO2. Lately, Gangadharan et al. [13] provided a significant message about evaluation of the economic and environmental impact of combining CDRM with SMR. They showed that the SMR±CDRM process has a lower carbon footprint than the conventional SMR process. Wu et al. [14] indicated that the SMR combined with CDRM would consume a massive high-temperature flue gas by burning unreacted fuel and hydrogen to develop a stand-alone hydrogen production. In general, the stand-alone concept is good for compact process plants or portable systems. The issues of global warming and greenhouse gas emissions are considered as energy-related problems [15], the heat exchanger network (HEN) technique is important for energy integration which has been satisfactorily developed to solve various chemical processes. Posada and Manousiouthakis [16] showed that the heat integration of SMR process could result in a 36% reduction in utility costs with respect to a conventional process. Similarly, the HEN method has been successfully implemented to many industrial plants, e.g. an industrial ethylbenzene plant [17] and an ethyl alcohol plant [18]. Inspired by the study of combined steam and carbon dioxide reforming of methane as a way to produce hydrogen [11–13], the high-pressure hydrogen production system with steam and carbon dioxide reforming of methane is developed. In our approach, the greenhouse gases, methane and carbon dioxide, are effectively consumed and regenerate a lot of syngas in two sequential reforming processes (SMR+CDRM) using extra energy at the high operating temperature. The HEN design and pinch analysis are employed to achieve the maximum heat recovery of the SMR+CDRM process such that the hot/cold utility loads can be saved by over 80%. Finally, the minimum annual total cost near the pinch is estimated."
1,Hydrogen production system,"To construct the SMR-CDRM process for the high-pressure hydrogen production, the corresponding system configuration is depicted in Fig. 1 . According to specifications for some reaction units in Table 1 under the following assumptions and conditions: (1) All reactions in each unit occur in the gas phase. (2) The SMR reactor, CDRM reactor and high-temperature water–gas-shift (HTWGS) reactors are considered as plug flow reactors. (3) The thermodynamic properties of some species are evaluated using the Peng–Robinson equation of state. Moreover, the steady-state simulation results are obtained using Aspen HYSYS®. In Fig. 1(a), the feed flows of methane and water are mixed after being heated and compressed, and then fed into the SMR reactor. The exothermic/endothermic reactions in the SMR are (1) CH4 +H2O↔CO+3H2(r 1), ΔH 0 298 =206.2kJmol−1 (2) CO+H2O↔CO2 +H2 (r 2), ΔH 0 298 =−41.2kJmol−1 (3) CH4 +2H2O ↔ CO2 +4H2 (r 3), ΔH 0 298 =165.0kJmol−1 The kinetic model proposed by Xu and Froment [19] for reaction on a Ni/MgAl2O4 catalyst is as follows: (4) r 1 = 4.225 × 10 15 D e n 2 exp 240.1 R T P CH 4 P H 2 O P H 2 2.5 − P H 2 0.5 P CO K 1 (5) r 2 = 1.955 × 10 6 D e n 2 exp 67.13 R T P CO P H 2 O P H 2 − P CO 2 K 2 (6) r 3 = 1.02 × 10 15 D e n 2 exp 243.9 R T P CH 4 P H 2 O 2 P H 2 3.5 − P H 2 0.5 P CO 2 K 1 K 2 where K 1 = exp ( − 26830 / T + 30.114 ) , K 2 = exp ( 4400 / T − 4.036 ) , and (7) D e n = 1 + 8.23 × 10 − 5 exp − 70.65 R T P CO + 6.12 × 10 − 9 exp − 82.90 R T P H 2 + 6.65 × 10 − 4 exp − 38.28 R T P CH 4 + 1.77 × 10 5 exp 88.68 R T P H 2 O P H 2 Notably, it is a Langmuir–Hinshelwood–Hougen–Watson (LHHW) type kinetic rate expression. Since the outlet temperature of the SMR is up to 1100K and the outlet stream contains carbon dioxide and un-reacted methane, a CDRM with a reaction temperature of 900–1100K is used to consume carbon dioxide and methane. By the high reactivity Ni-based catalysts, we assume that the reactions in the CDRM are simplified to a reversible endothermic reaction: (8) CH4 +CO2 ↔2CO+2H2 (r 4), ΔH 0 298 =247.0kJmol−1 The corresponding kinetic model is [20] (9) r 4 = 8.71 × 10 − 2 exp 23.7 R T P CH 4 P CO 2 1 − P CO 2 P H 2 2 K 3 P CH 4 P CO 2 Notably, the outlet temperature of the CDRM is up to 1000K and the outlet stream contains a large amount of syngas. Two HTWGS processes, HTWGS-1 and HTWGS-2, are added to increase the hydrogen yield, release the amount of heat via heat exchangers, and reduce the concentration of carbon monoxide in the stream. The kinetic model of HTWGS is expressed by [21]: (10) r W G S = 7.79 × 10 14 exp − 95 R T P CO 1.1 P H 2 O 0.53 1 − P CO 2 P H 2 K 2 P CO P H 2 O Moreover, a pressure swing adsorption (PSA-2) units and two flash separators (Separator-1 and Separator-1) are applied for hydrogen purification. High-purity hydrogen exits from the top of the PSA-2 unit. The waste gases including unreacted methane, carbon monoxide and other chemicals from the bottom of the PSA-2 unit are fed in the combustor to produce high-temperature flue gas. Finally, pure hydrogen is liquefied at very high pressure condition via three compressors. In steady-state simulation, SMR and CDRM are considered as non-isothermal reaction processes, heater or cooler is added to adjust the inlet temperature of every unit, pump and compressor are used to generate the higher pressure fluid stream, and other units are assumed as isothermal processes. Remark 1 Regarding the SMR+CDRM process, Fig. 2 shows that the high steam-to-methane molar ratio (S/C) in the feed and the high inlet temperature of SMR can enhance CH4 conversion. However, the too high operating temperature would consume a lot of energy resource. Referring to the operating conditions for a conventional SMR process [16], the same operating conditions of this SMR+CDRM process are chosen, e.g. a methane flow is 59.68kgh−1, a water flow is 209.52kgh−1, and the inlet temperatures of SMR and CO2 reformer are specified at 811K and 848K, respectively. In the proposed configuration, four units including SMR, CDRM, HTWGS-1 and HTWGS-1, are used to produce hydrogen. In Table 2 , the mole fraction and mass flow rate of hydrogen sequentially increase at the exit of each unit. In the outlet stream, a component H2 can achieve 0.645 but CO2 emission is close to 0.158. Notably, CH4 and CO as fuels are almost used up in this hydrogen production process. Moreover, two factors, the ratio of the mass flow of methane in the feed to the mass flow of hydrogen at the outlet stream (CH4/H2) and the ratio of the mass flow of carbon dioxide to the mass flow of hydrogen at the outlet stream (CO2/H2), are specified as indices of hydrogen production and carbon dioxide reduction. Comparisons of the SMR+CDRM and SRM [16] are shown as follows: (11) CH 4 /H 2 SMR + CDRM = 2.02 < H 2 / CH 4 SMR = 2.84 CO 2 / H 2 SMR + CDRM = 5.54 < CO 2 / CH 4 SMR = 6.78 Since two factors of the SMR+CDRM process are smaller than of the conventional SMR process, both indices imply that the proposed design may increase the hydrogen yield or suppress the greenhouse gases (CH4 +CO2) emissions. Moreover, composition profiles in the two reforming units are depicted in Fig. 3 . It is noted that the greenhouse gases (CH4 +CO2) is effectively consumed in CDRM as the hydrogen produced increases."
2,Heat integration,"In general, the heat integration using pinch analysis is a feasible technique to address the system with maximum waste heat recovery. The additional CDRM shown in Fig. 1 not only requires extra energy, but also some of heaters and coolers are used to adjust its inlet and outlet temperatures. To address the optimal heat integration design, the heat exchanger network (HEN) design is optimized to meet some energy targets including minimum number of heat exchangers, surface area and duties of external hot/cold utilities."
3,Pinch analysis,"3.1 Pinch analysis According to the prescribed conditions of mass flow rate and temperatures for eight hot stream and four cold streams in Fig. 1, the pinch analysis is shown in Fig. 4 to achieve the minimum energy consumption or maximum heat recovery. In Fig. 4(a), the minimum temperature difference between the hot and cold streams (ΔT min) is found. The corresponding pinch temperatures of hot and cold streams are 546°C and 536°C, respectively. Based on the idea energy-saving design regarding to zero net heat flow at the pinch, Fig. 4(b) shows that the duty of heating or cooling by hot utility (Hu) and cold utility (Cu) are 79.24kW and 92.36kW, respectively. Moreover, the minimum number of heat exchanger units ( u min ) and the total network area ( A t o t a l ) are specified as follows: [22] The minimum number of heat exchangers is shown as: (12) u min = N − 1 where N is the total number of streams (including utilities). The total surface area is shown as: (13) A t o t a l = 1 U ∑ k = 1 … K I n t e r v a l Δ H k Δ T L M , k where Δ T L M , k represents the log mean temperature difference at the prescribed segment k. K represents the number of segments, and the heat transfer coefficient U =0.1kJ/(hm2 K) is assumed to be the same for all streams. By Eqs. (12) and (13), the number of heat exchangers for the system heat recovery at the pinch is estimated to be 13 and the corresponding surface area is estimated to be 191m2."
4,Heat exchanger network (HEN),"3.2 Heat exchanger network (HEN) To construct the optimal HEN framework near the pinch, the feasible HEN is obtained by using Aspen Energy Analyzer when multiple shells and stream splitting are considered. In Fig. 5 , eight heat exchangers (white matches) are used to accomplish internal heat recovery, five heat exchangers (blue matches) are used to adjust temperatures of five hot streams from cold utility, and three heat exchangers (red matches) are used to adjust temperatures of three cold streams from hot utility. According to the specifications of sixteen heat exchangers (matches) in Table 3 , the total network area is 172.7m2, and the utility loads for heating and cooling are 93.1kW and 106.3kW, respectively. Remark 2 Pinch analysis shows the maximum process heat recovery possible. The optimal HEN design provides a feasible framework to achieve the process heat recovery near the pinch. The heating and cooling loads of the original system in Fig. 1 are estimated to be 525.1kW and 553kW, respectively. Within HEN framework, it effectively reduces the utility load for heating by 82.3% as well as the utility load for cooling by 80.8%. Through the HEN design with hot/cold stream splitting, the heat-integrated system is depicted in Fig. 6 . The hot utility (fired heater) via three matches (Hu-C4, Hu-C2, Hu-C1) heats up one of streams from 804K to 811K and also meets the heat demands of SMR and CDRM. The cold utility (cooling water) via five matches (Cu-H3, Cu-H7, Cu-H8, Cu-H6, Cu-H1) cools down the inlet stream of HTWGS-1 from 773K to 591K, and then cools down the outlet temperatures of three compressors sequentially to the normal temperature. After all, the cooling water is used to cool down the temperature of flue gas to the normal temperature. The methane feed flow is preheated via a match (H3-C3). The heat source from combustion via three matches (H1-C1, H1-C2, H1-C4) not only meets the heat demands of SRM and CDRM, but also it heats up one of streams from 492K to 804K. The hot stream from HTWGS-1 via a match (H4-C4) heats up one of streams from 492K to 804K. Another heat source from a flash drum via a match (H5-C4) heats up one of streams from 298K to 487K."
5,Cost evaluation,"3.3 Cost evaluation Regarding the cost evaluation of heat integration, the annual operating cost, annual capital cost, and the annual total cost are specified as follows. (14) Annual operating cost = costs of hot and cold utilities with (15) Hot / cold utility cost = m ˙ c P Δ T cost index where m ˙ represent the mass flow rate of fire heater or cooling water and Δ T = T i n − T o u t . (16) Annual capital cost = costs of heat exchanger and fired heater with (17) Cost of heat exchanger = a + b × A s N s h c × N s h (18) Cost of fired heater = a + b × ( heat duty ) c where A s represents the total network area and N sh is the number of shell. Notably, we assume N sh =41, and parameters, a, b, c, are specified by Aspen Energy Analyzer, e.g., a =10,000, b =800 and c =0.8 in Eq. (17) and a =100,000, b =1000 and c =0.8 in Eq. (18). (19) Total annual cost = Annual capital cost × 1 + Rate of return ( % ) / 100 ) PL PL + Annual operating cost In our design, we consider that plant life (PL)=5 (year) and rate of return(%)=10%. Remark 3 The annual total cost for heat integration is estimated from the costs for fuel and products in Table 4 , the (energy) operating cost in Table 5 , and the capital costs of auxiliary heat exchangers and interior heat exchangers. Using Aspen Energy Analyzer with prescribed cost parameters, Fig. 7 shows the profile of the annual total cost versus ΔT min. A trade-off between costs of capital and operating induces the minimum annual total cost at the optimum ΔT min. The simulation shows that the optimum ΔT min =9.5K near the pinch is roughly estimated to confirm the initial system design."
