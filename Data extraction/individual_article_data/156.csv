0,Introduction,"Amorphous metal alloys have attracted extensive interest in a wide range of applications such as efficient chemical production, energy conversion and storage, and environmental remediation because the randomly oriented bonds and the disorder atomic arrangement endow such glass-like structure with abundant defects and unsaturated surface atoms [1–3]. In addition, the isotropic and homogeneous properties provide the uniform dispersion of unsaturated sites and the modulation of the electronic structure, necessary to adsorb and activate reactants, and thus to improve catalytic activity [4–6]. Various amorphous metal alloy catalysts have been successfully synthesized with excellent activity/selectivity in versatile catalytic reactions [7–10]. In particular, amorphous transition metals borides such as CoB and NiB can be utilized into the hydrogenation of unsaturated bonds, including alkenes (CC), aldehydes (H–CO) and nitriles (CN) [11–13]. Recently, our group developed a micelle-assisted method to synthesize mesoporous amorphous alloys with a high surface area [14,15]. However, the morphology of these catalysts has been limited to only spherical particles. In this study, we expand this concept to synthesize the mesoporous amorphous ultra-long CoB nanochains. The selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes (e.g., cinnamaldehyde, CMA) to produce cinnamyl alcohol (CMO) is of great importance in flavoring, perfume, and pharmaceutical industries [16–18]. The hydrogenation reaction of CMA generally yields two intermediate products, hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCMA, Scheme 1 a) and cinnamyl alcohol (CMO, Scheme 1b), from the hydrogenation of CC and CO, respectively, and both can ultimately convert into hydrocinnamyl alcohol (HCMO, Scheme 1c). Because activation of CO is thermodynamically unfavorable relative to the CC group, favoring high chemical yield of CMO remains difficult [11,17,19]. Although noble metal alloys have been widely investigated to achieve this goal [20–23], their cost and scarcity make them unattractive for large-scale application. Thus, it is necessary and urgent to find alternative low-cost catalysts with high conversion efficacy and selectivity to CMO. Here, we prepared ultra-long mesoporous amorphous CoB alloy nanochains by a surfactant-assisted approach combined with a magnetic field. The nanochains are then used in liquid-phase CMA hydrogenation reaction to produce CMO. The final catalytic reaction conversion of CMA is as high as 94.9%, with an intermediate selectivity of 84.9% for the target CMO product. The high conversion of CMA can be attributed to the high specific surface area of the catalysts derived from the mesoporous structure. Besides, the electron-rich Co alloyed with boron is likely responsible for adsorbing the carbonyl groups of CMA, favoring the selective conversion into CMO."
1,Experimental details,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Cobalt (II) chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O), dimethylamine borane (DMAB), Pluronic F127, sodium borohydride (NaBH4), ethylene glycol (EG), and acetone were purchased from Aladdin Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Cinnamaldehyde (CMA) was purchased from Adamas-beta. All the chemicals are used without any further purification."
3,Preparation of CoB nanochains,"2.2 Preparation of CoB nanochains In a typical synthesis, 20 mg F127 was completely dissolved in 2 mL of aqueous 40 mM CoCl2·6H2O. Then 2 mL of EG and 2 mL of aqueous 200 mM DMAB were added to the above solution in sequence, resulting in a homogeneous and clear solution. After aging for 2 h in a heated water bath at 40 ℃, the reaction was triggered by adding a drop of NaBH4 into the solution, which then gradually turned black within 10 min. The reaction carried out on the magnetic field (RET basic IKAMAG® safety control). The samples were collected by centrifugation, washed several times with acetone and kept stored in acetone, denoted as CoB-F-EG. The control samples were synthesized under the same conditions, but without F127 block copolymer (CoB-EG) and without both F127 and EG (CoB). The crystallized samples were obtained by heating the amorphous samples at different temperatures (300 °C, 400 °C, 500 °C, and 600 °C) for 2.5 h at the heating rate of 5 °C min−1 under Ar in a tube furnace and then cooled to room temperature naturally. The samples are denoted CoB-F-EG_x, where x represents the annealing temperature."
4,Hydrogenation of CMA to CMO,"2.3 Hydrogenation of CMA to CMO The hydrogenation of CMA reaction was performed in a 100 mL high-pressure stainless-steel autoclave, in which the 30 mg catalyst was mixed with 20 mL ethanol (EtOH) and 0.5 mL CMA. After the reactor was purged with H2 and pressurized to 1.0 MPa, the system was heated up to 100 °C and kept for a specific time under stirring at 1050 rpm. The obtained products were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890B) equipped with FID detector, employing a DB-624 30 m × 0.320 mm capillary column. The product was detected using the area normalization method. The amount of reactant (CMA) and products (HCMA, CMO and HCMO) were further analyzed by GC. Thereby, the conversion of CMA and selectivity of the products were calculated based on the following formula: Wi = Ai × F i A ( C M A ) × F ( C M A ) + A ( H C M A ) × F ( H C M A ) + A ( C M O ) × F ( C M O ) + A ( H C M O ) × F ( H C M O ) × 100 Si = Wi W ( H C M A ) + W ( C M O ) + W ( H C M O ) × 100 C = 1 - W ( C M A ) / M ( C M A ) × 100 W ( C M A ) / M ( C M A ) + W ( H C M A ) / M ( H C M A ) + W ( C M O ) / M ( C M O ) + W ( H C M O ) / M ( H C M O ) where W is the percent of the product (i = CMA, HCMA, CMO, HCMO), F is the relative mass correction factor of the component (i = CMA, HCMA, CMO, HCMO), S is the selectivity toward the product (i = HCMA, CMO, HCMO), C is the conversion of CMA and A is the integrated areas of the GC peaks."
5,Materials characterization,"2.4 Materials characterization The morphology and structure of samples were observed by field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, SU-8000) operated at 5 kV and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100F) operated at 200 kV, respectively. The crystal phase of the samples was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Dmax-3C, Cu-Kα). The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured by a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 instrument at 77 K. The specific surface area (S BET) were calculated based on the desorption data. The surface elemental states were analyzed on PHI 5700 Versa Probe X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) with monochromator Al Kα (1486.7 eV) anode (24.5 W, 15 kV) as X-ray source."
6,Results and discussion,"The morphology and internal structure of the as-prepared CoB-F-EG were observed by SEM and TEM, as shown in Fig. 1 . According to Fig. 1a, b, the as-prepared sample exhibits an ultra-long linear structure with a length of several hundred micrometers and a width of around 120 nm, formed by the coalescence of numerous particles. Their surface is uniformly decorated with mesopores of approximately 11 ± 1 nm diameter (Figs. 1c and S1a). Detailed morphological information of samples was further explored by TEM, showing the 1D-shaped structure with mesopores on the edge of the samples (Fig. 1d, e). No clear lattice fringes are observed in the HRTEM image (Fig. 1f), suggesting an amorphous structure. This is further supported by the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern, indicative of a disordered atomic arrangement (Figs. 1i and S1b). The elemental mapping images indicate that Co and B are homogeneously distributed over the nanochains (Fig. 1g and h). The mesoporous amorphous CoB nanochains were successfully synthesized by a simple, low-cost method (see Experimental Information for details). Generally, the cooperative assembly of reduced metal and micelles is a critical step for the formation of mesoporous metals [15]. Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is an effective reducing agent to prepare amorphous alloys such as CoB, NiB, and RuB [24–27]. However, the strong reducing capability of NaBH4 usually forbids the formation of mesopores due to the rapid nucleation and growth. In this study, a small amount of NaBH4 was used to trigger the formation of CoB nuclei, while a weaker reducing agent (DMAB) is responsible to ensure further growth. The formation of amorphous CoB nanochains can be simply described in Scheme 2 . Under the right (present) conditions, amphiphilic block copolymers can self-assemble into spherical micelles. In a water-EG mixture, F127 micelles have their hydrophilic PEO blocks located in the shell and their hydrophobic PPO blocks in the core. In aqueous solution, the dissolved Co2+ ions are coordinated by water molecules to form Co-water complexes, interacting with the PEO shell through hydrogen bonding [28]. After the addition of NaBH4, the reduction of Co-water complexes starts (Fig. S2), and continuous growth is secured by the presence of DMAB. In addition, the application of a magnetic field is necessary to obtain oriented growth, as suggested by samples synthesized outside the apparatus (Fig. S3) [29,30]. During the synthesis process, F127 plays a significant role in promoting the formation of mesopores and the sample homogeneity. From the SEM and TEM images of CoB-EG (prepared without F127) and CoB (prepared without F127 and EG) (Fig. S4), we can safely assume that F127 is responsible for the formation of mesopores, while the presence of EG leads to nanoparticles with narrower size distribution, thus improving the homogeneity of the nanochains. The CoB-F-EG morphology evolution was monitored by SEM and TEM, 3, 5, and 20 min after the addition of NaBH4 (Fig. S5). As expected, the mesoporous particles are randomly formed initially, and gradually assemble into chain-like structures under the magnetic field, owing to the superparamagnetic property of CoB. After 10 min (Fig. 1a, b), uniform mesoporous nanochains are obtained and remain as such even after further reaction time (Fig. S5d). Fig. 2 a shows the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm with a hysteresis. The mesoporous CoB samples (CoB-F-EG) possessed a specific surface area of 49.8 m2 g−1, which is higher than the non-porous samples (CoB-EG and CoB) (Fig. S6a and Table S1). A higher surface area is expected to supply more active sites suitable for the catalysis of CMA molecules. As shown in Fig. 2b, the corresponding XRD patterns of all samples display a broad single diffraction peak around 2θ = 45°, confirming the amorphous nature of CoB [11]. The chemical composition and electronic state of the as-prepared material were studied by XPS resolved around the binding energies of B 1s and Co 2p 3/2 (Fig. 2c and d, respectively). The peak located at 187.8 eV can be ascribed to the interaction of boron with cobalt, whereas the one peak at 191.8 eV corresponds to the boron-oxo species, which arose from the oxidation on the surface of CoB during the synthesis or the atmospheric exposure [15]. The peak located at 778.2 eV corresponds to the Co0 in CoB [26]. The additional peak located at 781.3 eV is indicative of the Co2+ species due to the spontaneous oxidization occurring at the surface. Note that the worthy, there is a positive chemical shift of 0.6 eV for B compared with pure B, indicating that the elemental B is not present in the free state but instead of alloying with the metallic Co [11]. Electrons from B partially transfer to Co by occupying d-orbitals through hybridization of B 2p states, making boron electron deficient and metal enriched in electrons [31,32]. The electron-rich Co in CoB can facilitate the selectivity of CMA hydrogenation to CMO [11]. Amorphous alloys have been demonstrated as effective catalysts for hydrogenation reactions [1]. Here, we chose the selective hydrogenation of CMA as a model reaction to evaluate the catalytic performance of mesoporous amorphous CoB alloy. Firstly, we optimized the reaction conditions upon the amount of catalyst and solvent, as shown in Tables S2 and S3. At present system, the typical experimental condition for the reaction was carried out at 100 °C in a Parr 4848 autoclave with 30 mg catalyst, 20 mL ethanol (EtOH), 0.5 mL CMA and 1.0 MPa H2 under vigorous stirring (1050 rpm) to eliminate the diffusion effect (See Experimental Information for details). Fig. 3 a, b shows the product contents and evolution of reactant over time, respectively, catalyzed by the typical CoB-F-EG sample. The conversion of CMA and selectivity of the target CMO product gradually increases. After 4 h, the CMO selectivity reaches a maximum (84.9%), in comparison to very low selectivity of HCMA (7.9%) and HCMO (7.2%) by-products. This result suggests the preferential activation of the CO bond on the mesoporous amorphous CoB alloy. The initial reactant is fully consumed after 4 h of reaction, and the sites for hydrogenation are relocated on the intermediate CMO and HCMA products, causing their respective conversion into HCMO. Fig. 3c shows the low performance of non-porous CoB and CoB-EG samples, suggesting that the surface area has a significant impact on the catalytic efficacy. To study the influence of the amorphous nature, all the samples (i.e. CoB-F-EG, CoB-EG, CoB) were annealed at 500 °C for 2.5 h under argon (named as CoB-F-EG_500, CoB-EG_500, and CoB_500). The XRD peaks attributed to the CoB crystal structure (i.e., a face centered cubic structure) appear at 2θ = 44.2°, 51.5°, and 75.8° (Fig. S7). The corresponding SEM images (Fig. S8) reveal that the annealed samples still maintain the nanochain structure but without mesoporous structure. Fig. S6b shows that all of the thermally treated samples exhibit very low specific surface areas compared to untreated counterparts (Table S1). The reusability test of mesoporous amorphous CoB-F-EG nanochains samples was carried out five times under the same reaction conditions (Fig. 3d). All the recycled catalysts were collected by centrifugation without any other operations. The CMO selectivity remains unaffected after five recycling steps, while the CMA conversion decreases slightly down to around 80%, maybe due to the loss of catalyst during the recycling and collection process. The performance of CoB-F-EG samples annealed at 300 °C, 400 °C, 500 °C, and 600 °C (Fig. S9) were also examined to study the relation between crystallization and catalytic activity. We notice a continuous decrease in conversion/selectivity as temperature (and crystallinity) increases (Fig. 3e, f). Reduced specific surface area caused by agglomeration and crystallization is partly responsible for the low CMA conversion. It is also noted that the binding energy of Co (778.5 eV) in crystalline CoB-F-EG after thermal treatment (Fig. S10) is positively shifted compared with amorphous CoB-F-EG alloy before thermal treatment (778.2 eV). This shifted binding energy reduces the likelihood for Co site to react with CO, resulting in the low CMO selectivity. The mechanism for the high CMO selectivity on amorphous mesoporous CoB alloy can be described as follows. The contact and adsorption of CC sites from the electron-rich benzene ring (in CMA) on the negatively charged Co sites are not favored. At the same time, large space occupied by the benzene rings create a steric hindrance hindering the adsorption of CC, while promoting the adsorption of CO on the catalyst surface, resulting in the higher selectivity of the hydrogenation of CO [11]."
7,Conclusion,"In this study, the mesoporous CoB amorphous alloy nanochains are developed via a simple, low-cost method under the assistance of a magnetic field. The high surface area and electron-rich cobalt in mesoporous amorphous Co-B are responsible for providing abundant active sites for the reaction and promoting the adsorption of the reactants, respectively, then resulting in a high conversion and selectivity for CMO. Additionally, amorphous alloy and the electron-rich Co sites favor the selective absorption of CO due to the existence of steric hindrance with the adsorption of CC. These advantages enable mesoporous amorphous CoB nanochains to show superior activity and selectivity in liquid-phase CMA hydrogenation/conversion in CMO. This strategy may also be applied to synthesize other metal-boron amorphous alloys with various morphologies and pores and provide opportunities for industrial catalytic applications."
