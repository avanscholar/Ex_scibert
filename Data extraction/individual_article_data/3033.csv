0,Introduction,"Due to depletion of petroleum-based resources and increasing concern about global warming, various researches on new and clean energies have been conducted [1–5]. Hydrogen has been considered as an important energy carrier due to its high specific energy density, eco-friendliness, and abundance [6,7]. Many kinds of hydrocarbons such as natural gas, gasoline, alcohols, and aromatics can be used as a hydrogen source [8–10]. However, recent breakthrough in shale gas recovery technologies and positive outlook on abundant reserves of natural gas make methane the most feasible hydrogen source [11]. Among reforming processes that can produce hydrogen from methane, tri-reforming has attracted much attention recently [12–14]. Tri-reforming is a combination of following three methane reforming processes; steam reforming (Eq. (1)), partial oxidation (Eq. (2)), and carbon dioxide reforming (Eq. (3)) [15]. (1) CH4 +H2O→CO+3H2 (ΔH°=+206kJ/mol) (2) CH4 +1/2O2 →CO+2H2 (ΔH°=−36kJ/mol) (3) CH4 +CO2 →2CO+2H2 (ΔH°=+247kJ/mol). Combined tri-reforming has a merit of high economical advantage of steam reforming, high energy efficiency of exothermal partial oxidation reaction, and environmental advantage of carbon dioxide reforming [16–18]. Although gases with various compositions can be used for the tri-reforming of methane, direct use of flue gases without separation has an economical competitiveness [19]. Typical flue gases from natural gas-fired power plants contain 18–20% H2O, 8–10% CO2, 2–3% O2, and 67–72% N2, which is suitable for the direct use in the tri-reforming [19]. Tri-reforming reaction is thermodynamically favorable at high temperature [20]. However, conventional supported nickel catalysts tend to be sintered during the reforming processes at high temperature, resulting in catalyst deactivation [21]. Severe coke formation is another reason for catalyst deactivation of supported nickel catalysts [22]. To overcome these problems, various preparation methods have been investigated to modify physicochemical properties of the catalysts. For example, it has been reported that an ordered mesoporous support suppressed sintering of active metal species due to confinement effect of separated mesoporous channels [23]. It has also been reported that a nickel catalyst coated with silica overlayer exhibited an enhanced catalyst stability in the carbon dioxide reforming of methane [24]. It is known that well-developed mesoporous nickel-based catalysts retained excellent catalytic activity during the reforming reactions due to high mass transfer rate of reactant molecules and finely dispersed nickel particles [25]. Aerogel-based catalysts with outstanding textural properties compared to xerogel-based catalysts showed high and stable catalytic activity in the steam reforming reactions in the previous study [26]. However, a mesoporous nickel–alumina aerogel catalyst prepared by an epoxide-initiated gelation method has never been applied for hydrogen production by tri-reforming of methane. Therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate the catalytic performance of mesoporous nickel–alumina aerogel catalyst prepared by an epoxide-initiated gelation method in the tri-reforming of methane. In this work, a mesoporous nickel–alumina aerogel catalyst was prepared by an epoxide-initiated gelation method followed by a supercritical carbon dioxide drying method. For comparison, a mesoporous nickel–alumina xerogel catalyst was also prepared by an epoxide-initiated gelation method followed by a conventional drying method. The effect of catalyst preparation method on the physicochemical properties and catalytic activities in the tri-reforming of methane was investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts A mesoporous nickel–alumina aerogel catalyst (denoted as NAA) with 20wt% nickel loading was prepared by an epoxide-initiated gelation method followed by a carbon dioxide drying method [27]. 20.7g of Al(NO3)3∙9H2O (Junsei, 98%) and 2.8g of Ni(NO3)2∙6H2O (Sigma–Aldrich, ≥97%) were introduced into a media bottle containing 150ml of ethanol. The solution was stirred for 20min at a stirring rate of 500rpm to achieve uniform mixing. 45ml of propylene oxide (Acros Organics, 99%) was then added into the solution to initiate a hydrolysis reaction. As condensation and cross-linking between nickel and aluminum precursors proceeded, the solution became opaque. After a few minutes without stirring, nickel–alumina composite gel was formed. The resulting gel was maintained at room temperature for 2 days and it was washed by 100ml of ethanol several times. The gel was transferred to an autoclave, and supercritical carbon dioxide drying was done at 50°C and 100bar for 4h. The obtained aerogel grain was calcined at 700°C for 5h at the final stage. For comparison, a mesoporous nickel–alumina xerogel catalyst (denoted as NAX) with 20 wt% nickel loading was also prepared by the similar methods described above, except that it was dried by evaporative drying at 80°C for 48h in a convection oven instead of supercritical carbon dioxide drying."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Specific surface area measurement and pore structure determination of NAA and NAX catalysts were performed by nitrogen sorption at −196°C using a BELSORP-mini II (BEL Japan) apparatus. Prior to the measurement, moisture on the catalyst surface was removed at 150°C for 5h by a vacuum pump. Chemical composition of the catalysts was measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analyses using an ICPS-100IV (Shimadzu) analyzer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by a D-Max2500-PC (Rigaku) diffractometer equipped with a copper anode (Cu-Kα, λ =1.541Å). The instrument was operated at 50kV and 100mA with a scan rate of 10°/min. Diffraction patterns were collected within 2θ range of 20–80°. For the XRD patterns of reduced NAA and NAX catalysts, 25mg of each catalyst was pretreated with a 5% hydrogen and balance argon flow (50ml/min) at 700°C for 3h. Nickel-alumina interaction was investigated by hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) measurements using a continuous flow fixed-bed apparatus. For the H2-TPR measurement, 25mg of each catalyst was charged into an U-shaped quartz reactor and it was reduced by a hydrogen flow (2ml/min) diluted with nitrogen (20ml/min). Temperature was then raised from room temperature to 1000°C at a heating rate of 5°C/min. H2-TPR profiles were acquired using a gas chromatograph (ACME 6000, Younglin) connected to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed to examine morphology and nickel dispersion of the catalysts using a TEM instrument (JEM-3010, Jeol). For the TEM measurement, catalyst powder was dispersed in ethanol by ultrasonic vibration for 1h and a drop of solution was put on a copper mesh grid with a carbon layer-covered formvar film. Hydrogen temperature-programmed desorption (H2-TPD) analyses were conducted to measure nickel dispersion using a BELCAT-B instrument (BEL Japan). Prior to the measurement, 25mg of each catalyst sample was reduced under a 5% hydrogen and balance argon flow (50ml/min) at 700°C for 3h. After the sample was cooled to 50°C under an argon flow (50ml/min), catalyst surface was saturated with hydrogen molecules under a 5% hydrogen and balance argon flow (50ml/min) at 50°C for 30min. To remove physisorbed hydrogen molecules, the sample was purged under an argon flow (50ml/min) at 100°C for 1h. H2-TPD profile was collected under argon atmosphere (30ml/min) by increasing temperature from 50°C to 950°C at a rate of 5°C/min. The desorbed hydrogen was detected using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). To calculate nickel dispersion, it was assumed that adsorption stoichiometry of H:Ni was 1:1 and cross-sectional area of nickel atom was 6.49×10−20 m2. Methane adsorption capacity of the catalysts was measured by performing CH4-TPD experiments using a continuous flow fixed-bed apparatus. Prior to the CH4-TPD experiment, 0.1g of each catalyst sample was reduced at 700°C for 3h by a hydrogen flow (3ml/min) diluted with helium (30ml/min). After cooling the sample to room temperature under a helium flow (5ml/min), 10ml of methane was pulsed into the reactor for 10 times to saturate active sites with methane. Physisorbed methane was removed by purging the sample at 50°C for 1h under a flow of helium (15ml/min). The measurement was conducted under a helium flow (15ml/min) by increasing temperature from 50°C to 600°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min. The desorbed methane was detected using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). In order to measure the amount of deposited carbon on the used catalysts, CHNS elemental measurements were conducted (CHNS 932, Leco)."
4,Tri-reforming of methane,"2.3 Tri-reforming of methane Tri-reforming of methane over NAA and NAX catalysts was performed in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor at 600–800°C under atmospheric pressure. Prior to the reaction, 20mg of each catalyst was reduced at 700°C for 3h by a hydrogen flow (3ml/min) diluted with nitrogen (30ml/min). For tri-reforming reaction, reactant stream composed of CH4 (22ml/min), O2 (1.67ml/min), CO2 (6ml/min), and N2 (46.3ml/min) was continuously supplied to the reactor. Distilled water was supplied by a syringe pump through a preheating zone (200°C) to generate steam flow (13.6ml/min). Feed composition was fixed at H2O:O2:CO2:N2 =19:2.5:9:69.5 (vol%), which was the same as average composition of power plant flue gas. The ratio of (H2O+2O2 +CO2) to CH4 was kept at 1.04. Total flow rate with respect to catalyst was maintained at 269,000ml/(hgcat). The composition of outlet gases was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (ACME 6000, Younglin) connected to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Porapak N and Molecular Sieve 5A columns were used for product separation. Hydrogen yield and methane conversion were calculated according to the following equations. (4) Hydrogen yield ( % ) = F H 2 , out 2 × F C H 4 , i n × 100 (5) Methane conversion ( % ) = F C H 4 , in − F C H 4 , out F C H 4 , i n × 100 In order to investigate the effect of catalyst preparation method on individual steam reforming, partial oxidation, and carbon dioxide reforming, each individual reaction was conducted at 700°C for 180min. Feed rate of reactant gas was 20.38ml/min for each CH4, H2O, O2, and CO2 under N2 carrier (42.92ml/min). Other reaction conditions were kept unchanged."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Physicochemical properties of catalysts,"3.1 Physicochemical properties of catalysts Textural properties of NAX and NAA catalysts were examined by nitrogen sorption measurements as shown in Fig. 1 . Both catalysts exhibited type-IV isotherms which were related to capillary condensation of well-developed mesoporous structure. It is noteworthy that NAA catalyst showed H1 type hysteresis while NAX catalyst exhibited H2 type hysteresis. This indicates that NAA catalyst retained a mesoporous structure formed by spherical agglomerates while NAX catalyst possessed “ink-bottle” type pores [28,29]. Detailed textural properties of calcined NAX and NAA catalysts determined from the isotherms are summarized in Table 1 . The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was used to calculate surface area of the catalysts. Both catalysts showed high surface area (>300m2/g), large pore volume (>0.5cm3/g), and large average pore diameter (>7.0nm) within mesopore range. Nickel loading of both catalysts measured by ICP–AES analyses was in good agreement with the designed value. These results indicate that both catalysts were successfully prepared in this work. However, NAA catalyst exhibited higher surface area, larger pore volume, and larger average pore diameter than NAX catalyst. From this result, it can be inferred that supercritical carbon dioxide drying played an important role in enhancing mesoporous properties of NAA catalyst during the preparation process."
7,Crystalline structure and metal-support interaction of calcined catalysts,"3.2 Crystalline structure and metal-support interaction of calcined catalysts Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of NAX and NAA catalysts calcined at 700°C for 5h. Nickel oxide phase was not detected in the XRD patterns of both catalysts. Instead, both catalysts exhibited weak diffraction peaks indicative of surface nickel aluminate phase, implying strong nickel–alumina interaction derived from Ni–O–Al composite structure (solid lines in Fig. 2) [30,31]. This means that both catalysts retained an amorphous nickel–alumina structure even after the high temperature calcination process. It is believed that well-developed mesoporous structure of the catalysts retarded crystallization process, preventing the formation of highly crystallized γ-Al2O3 phase [32]. Interestingly, the diffraction peak for γ-Al2O3 (440) phase (dashed line in Fig. 2) shifted toward lower diffraction angle in both catalysts. This is because γ-Al2O3 lattice was expanded by the incorporation of Ni2+ ions, representing fine dispersion of nickel species [27,33]. Furthermore, intensities of diffraction peaks for NAA catalyst were weaker than those for NAX catalyst. From the result, it is inferred that nickel species in the NAA catalyst were more finely dispersed on alumina support than those in the NAX catalyst. Metal-support interaction in the NAX and NAA catalysts was investigated by H2-TPR measurements as presented in Fig. 3 . Both catalysts showed a single reduction band at 500–800°C, indicating the strong nickel–alumina interaction through the formation of surface nickel aluminate phase [34,35]. This result was in good agreement with XRD results of calcined catalysts (Fig. 2). It should be noted that the reduction peak of NAA catalyst appeared at higher temperature than that of NAX catalyst. That is, nickel–alumina interaction in the NAA catalyst was stronger than that in the NAX catalyst although nickel loading in both catalysts was nearly identical. It is believed that high surface area and large pore volume of NAA catalyst led to high dispersion of nickel species, forming small nickel particles. When nickel loading is same, nickel–alumina catalyst with smaller nickel particles retains much more amount of nickel atoms chemically interacted with alumina support than nickel–alumina catalyst with larger nickel particles [36]. Therefore, high nickel dispersion in the NAA catalyst is believed to be responsible for strong nickel–alumina interaction."
8,Nickel dispersion of reduced catalysts,"3.3 Nickel dispersion of reduced catalysts XRD patterns of reduced NAX and NAA catalysts are presented in Fig. 4 . No obvious characteristic peaks of nickel aluminate phase appeared. Instead, both catalysts showed diffraction peaks indicative of metallic nickel (solid lines in Fig. 4). Also, the diffraction peak for γ-Al2O3 (440) phase (dashed line in Fig. 4) moved back to the original diffraction angle. It can be inferred that nickel species in the NAX and NAA catalysts were successfully reduced into metallic nickel during the reduction process. It was observed that intensities of diffraction peaks for reduced NAA catalyst was weaker than those for reduced NAX catalyst, indicating that nickel particles in the reduced NAA catalyst were smaller than those in the reduced NAX catalyst. Crystallite size of nickel particles in the reduced NAX and NAA catalysts was calculated by the Scherrer’s equation on Ni (111) peaks in the XRD patterns of Fig. 4, as listed in Table 2 . Nickel particle size of NAA catalyst was smaller than that of NAX catalyst. In order to check the reliability of nickel particle size measured by XRD, TEM analyses were performed. Fig. 5 shows the TEM images of NAX (Fig. 5(a)) and NAA (Fig. 5(b)) catalysts reduced at 700°C. Although metallic nickel was well dispersed in both catalysts, NAA catalyst showed smaller nickel particle size than NAX catalyst. Therefore, it can be inferred that supercritical carbon dioxide drying employed for the preparation of NAA catalyst was essential for enhancing textural properties and for forming small nickel particles of NAA catalyst. H2-TPD experiments were conducted over the reduced NAX and NAA catalysts in order to calculate nickel dispersion of the catalysts as shown in Fig. 6 . H2-TPD profiles of the catalysts were deconvoluted into four domains for quantitative analysis (Fig. 6). According to the previous report [35], the desorption band above 650°C is attributed to hydrogen molecules desorbed from subsurface layer or hydrogen spillover. Therefore, the band above 650°C was excluded in calculating nickel dispersion. The desorption bands below 650°C, which are attributed to hydrogen desorbed from active nickel species, can be classified into three types; weak site (<250°C), medium site (250–350°C), and strong site (350–550°C) [37]. Among three types of hydrogen desorption sites, strong site is known to be an important factor determining the catalytic performance because it has an excellent ability to stabilize hydrogen atoms dissociated from methane in the reforming reactions [38]. The amount of hydrogen desorbed from active nickel species was calculated from the peak area (<650°C) as summarized in Table 3 . It should be noted that NAA catalyst not only showed larger total amount of desorbed hydrogen but also retained more strong hydrogen-binding sites than NAX catalyst. It is believed that strong metal-support interaction in the NAA catalyst led to electronically favorable state of nickel for hydrogen-bonding, facilitating the dehydrogenation reaction [38]. Therefore, it is expected that NAA catalyst with larger amount of strong hydrogen-binding sites would show better catalytic performance than NAX catalyst. Nickel dispersion was calculated from total amount of desorbed hydrogen by assuming H/Niatom =1. It was revealed that NAA catalyst showed higher nickel dispersion than NAX catalyst, in good agreement with XRD (Fig. 4) and TEM (Fig. 5) results."
9,Methane adsorption study on reduced catalysts,"3.4 Methane adsorption study on reduced catalysts In order to investigate methane adsorption capacity, CH4-TPD measurements were conducted (Fig. 7 ). Both catalyst exhibited a single desorption band at around 370°C. According to the literature [39], carbon species desorbed at 300–400°C are attributed to partially dehydrogenated carbon during the adsorption step. That is, a nickel catalyst which shows larger methane adsorption capacity in the CH4-TPD measurement is expected to dissociate CH bond more effectively in the reforming reactions. It is also known that CH bond dissociation in the methane dehydrogenation process is the rate determining step of reforming reactions [40–42]. Therefore, methane adsorption capacity serves as a crucial factor determining the catalytic performance in the tri-reforming of methane. The amount of desorbed methane was calculated from the peak area in the CH4-TPD profiles as summarized in Table 4 . It was observed that NAA catalyst showed larger amount of desorbed methane than NAX catalyst. According to the literature [27], methane adsorption site of nickel catalyst, which is active for dissociating CH bond of methane, increases with increasing nickel dispersion of the catalyst. Therefore, NAA catalyst with high nickel dispersion showed high methane adsorption capacity. Thus, it is expected that NAA catalyst with higher nickel dispersion and larger methane adsorption capacity would show higher catalytic activity than NAX catalyst in the tri-reforming of methane."
10,Hydrogen production by tri-reforming of methane,"3.5 Hydrogen production by tri-reforming of methane Tri-reforming of methane was conducted over NAX and NAA catalysts at 600–800°C as shown in Fig. 8 . It was observed that hydrogen yield and CH4 conversion increased with increasing reaction temperature over both catalysts. Furthermore, NAA catalyst showed higher hydrogen yield and higher CH4 conversion than NAX catalyst. Fig. 9 shows the catalytic performance of NAX and NAA catalysts in the tri-reforming of methane with time on stream at 700°C. Both catalysts showed a stable catalytic activity without noticeable deactivation during a 600-min reaction. It is believed that high surface area, large pore volume, and large average pore diameter of NAX and NAA catalysts facilitated internal diffusion of reactants and products during the reaction. High nickel dispersion and strong nickel–alumina interaction were also the reason for stable catalytic activity of NAX and NAA catalysts. However, NAA catalyst showed higher hydrogen yield and higher methane conversion than NAX catalyst. It is believed that high nickel dispersion and large methane adsorption capacity of NAA catalyst accelerated the methane dehydrogenation reaction as discussed in Section 3.4. That is, high nickel dispersion and large methane adsorption capacity of NAA catalyst played a crucial role for its excellent catalytic performance in the hydrogen production by tri-reforming of methane. It is worthwhile to note that NAA catalyst showed higher H2/CO ratio than NAX catalyst during the reaction. This can be understood by the fact that nickel-based catalyst with high surface area can promote water gas shift reaction, leading to high H2/CO ratio [43,44]. Average catalytic performance of NAX and NAA catalysts in the tri-reforming and individual reforming reactions (steam reforming, partial oxidation, and carbon dioxide reforming) is listed in Table 5 . The result clearly showed that hydrogen yield and methane conversion of NAA catalyst were higher than those of NAX catalyst in three individual reforming reactions (steam reforming, partial oxidation, and carbon dioxide reforming). It is believed that high nickel dispersion and large methane adsorption capacity of NAA catalyst increased the catalytic performance in individual steam reforming, partial oxidation, and carbon dioxide reforming, and in turn, in tri-reforming reaction. In order to quantify coke formation during the tri-reforming process, CHNS elemental analyses were conducted on the used NAX and NAA catalysts (Table 6 ). Although both catalysts showed a stable performance with time on stream, the amount of carbon on the NAA catalyst was smaller than that on the NAX catalyst. It is known that adjacent active sites on nickel agglomerates are known to be responsible for carbon deposition in the reforming reactions [45]. Accordingly, it is believed that NAA catalyst with well-developed mesoporous structure and high nickel dispersion effectively suppressed the coke formation."
11,Conclusions,"A mesoporous nickel–alumina aerogel catalyst (NAA) was prepared by an epoxide-initiated gelation method and a supercritical carbon dioxide drying method. For comparison, a mesoporous nickel–alumina xerogel catalyst (NAX) was also prepared by an epoxide-initiated gelation method without supercritical carbon dioxide drying. Although both catalysts retained a well-defined mesoporous structure, NAA catalyst showed better textural properties than NAX catalyst. From XRD, H2-TPR, and TEM analyses, it was found that NAA catalyst retained smaller nickel particles and stronger nickel–alumina interaction than NAX catalyst. H2-TPD measurements revealed that NAA catalyst showed higher nickel dispersion and larger amount of strong hydrogen-binding sites than NAX catalyst. Methane adsorption capacity measured by CH4-TPD was well matched with the amount of strong hydrogen-binding sites. In the tri-reforming of methane, both catalysts showed a stable catalytic performance in terms of hydrogen yield and methane conversion. However, NAA catalyst not only retained stronger resistant to coke formation but also showed higher hydrogen yield and higher methane conversion than NAX catalyst. The superior catalytic performance of NAA catalyst in the tri-reforming of methane was due to its high nickel dispersion and high methane affinity."
