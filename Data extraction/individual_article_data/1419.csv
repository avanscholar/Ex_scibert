0,Introduction,"Among the renewable fuels, hydrogen (H2) as an energy carrier has the long-term potential of reducing dependency on fossil fuels and exhibits zero carbon emissions since its oxidation reactions produce water vapor [1,2]. However, overall environmental impact and energy efficiency of H2 depend on its sources and means of production. H2 can be produced from a variety of feedstocks, including fossil fuels such as natural gas (NG), oil and coal and renewable sources like biomass [3,4]. Steam reforming (SR) of hydrocarbons (HCs), especially NG is the most common method for H2 production, yet it is not attractive approach due to its fossil-fuel derived feedstock [5]. Recent research has dwelt on oxygenated HCs, including; bio-oil [6,7], glycerol [8–10], and methanol [11–13], yet ethanol (EtOH) reforming is considered another attractive and low cost renewable feedstock due to high H2 content and can be produced renewably from biomass through fermentation [14,15]. Since, the boiling point of EtOH is lower than H2O, thus EtOH reformed can be conducted through three main techniques; partial oxidation (POX), auto-thermal reforming (ATR) and steam reforming (ESR) [16]. POX reaction requires lower energy input for fuel evaporation compared to ATR and ESR because water is absent as a reactant. Air can be used as an oxidant substitute for O2 in the reaction, making POX more economical as explained in Eq. (1) [17–19] (1) C 2 H 5 OH + 3 2 O 2 → 2 CO 2 + 3 H 2 Δ H = - 554 kJ / mol However, the maximum theoretical yield of POX is 3 mol H2 per mole EtOH reacted which is half the value achievable in ESR. Furthermore, the products from POX greatly depend on stoichiometric amount of O2, and this makes POX a very unpredictable and sensitive reaction with regard to control. ATR, also called oxidative steam reforming (OSR), is a combination of ESR and POX. This combination provides for a reasonable compromise between hydrogen yield and energy efficiency. The presence of O2 in the reaction mixture promotes efficient removal of carbon species from side reactions [20]. To achieve thermal neutrality, the feed composition should be constituted as per chemical reaction in Eq. (2) [21]. (2) C 2 H 5 OH + 1.78 H 2 O + 0.61 O 2 → 2 CO 2 + 4.78 H 2 Δ H = 0 kJ / mol Similar to POX, air is commonly preferred to O2 due to cost. Unfortunately, inert N2 in air hinders successive collisions between reactants and catalysts. ESR involves catalytic chemical reaction at high temperatures where it is converted into H2 rich gas with carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and water (H2O) as the main by-products [22–24]. However, H2 yield from SR of EtOH is highly dependent of the EtOH/H2O feed ratios. For an equimolar feed of EtOH and H2O, the theoretical H2 yield is 4 mol per mol EtOH. Complete ESR results in a maximum theoretical H2 yield of 6 mol per mole EtOH as outlined in Eq. (3) [16]. (3) C 2 H 5 OH + 3 H 2 O ↔ 6 H 2 + 3 CO 2 Δ H = 174 kJ / mol ESR is favored by high S/E feed ratios, while increased reaction temperatures could result in equilibrium shifting to the right of Eq. (3), leading to higher conversion of EtOH and yield of H2. The main difference in the ethanol reforming processes lies in the thermal nature of reactions, feed composition and hydrogen yield. ESR gives highest H2 yield while ATR has the least heat requirement. Due to the advantage in H2 yield, it is of great importance to explore further ESR. However, the product distribution of ESR is not only governed by the reaction temperature but also depends on other parameters such as pressure, feed molar ratio and feed dilution affect. The first step toward understanding the effects of process variables is a complete thermodynamic analysis. This could be helpful to investigate the effect of these parameters and will give ideal conditions to get maximum hydrogen production with minimum coke and byproducts [25,26]. On the other hand, catalyst loading, particle geometry, space-time and contact time also play a major role in heterogeneous system of ethanol reforming. Recently, spinel oxides such as La2O3, CeO2, SiO2 and ZrO2 are proposed as catalyst supports due to their stability in terms of resistance to coking and sintering [20,27]. Among the metals, Ni is widely employed in the industry because it has low cost and exhibit good activity and H2 selectivity in reforming processes owing to the excellent ability of CC and CH cleavage and sufficient oxygen transport capability [28–31]. We reported Ni/Pd-incorporated La2O3-Al2O3 composite for selective hydrogen production from steam reforming of PET-phenol solution [32,33]. TiO2, being a similar spinel oxide has added encouraging advantages due to relatively low cost, abundance in availability, chemically/thermally and biologically stable and is non-toxic [34]. Although, TiO2 catalysts have been extensively studied with respect to photo-catalysis [35,36], recently, La/TiO2 catalyst is found efficient for ethanol steam reforming toward H2 production with reduced coke formation [37]. The dispersion of Ni on TiO2 could be improved by co-loading TiO2 with CeO2, SiO2 or ZrO2 supports. Alternatively, green materials with porous structure such as natural clay minerals can be dispersed with TiO2 due to their higher surface areas, high metal dispersion with reduced coke deposition and sintering resistance [38,39]. Among the natural clay minerals, montmorillonite (MMT) is a pillared clay and crystal structure consists of layers made up of inner octahedral sheet sandwiched between two outer tetrahedral silicon layers. The clay-TiO2 heterojunction could be helpful to develop efficient nanocomposites materials for ESR [40]. Recently, Ni loaded over montmorillonite support was tested for hydrogen production from ethanol steam reforming and found best performance for selective H2 production due to high Ni dispersion with strong sintering and coke resistance effects by MMT support [41]. Similarly, Ni-CaO promoted MMT catalysts tested for ESR and found high activity and stability due to enhanced metal dispersion with minimized sintering and coke formation effects [42]. Therefore, it is promising to investigate Ni as an active metal over MMT-dispersed TiO2 catalyst for selective and enhanced hydrogen production via ESR reaction. Herein, thermodynamics and experimental analysis of ESR for selective H2 production using montmorillonite supported Ni/TiO2 catalyst has been investigated. The impact of several process parameters, related to reaction temperature, steam-to-ethanol feed ratio on activity and stability performance of the catalyst is analyzed. The equilibrium concentrations of different compounds were calculated by direct minimization of the Gibbs free energy. The samples were prepared by a sol-gel and impregnation technique for steam reforming of ethanol for H2 production. Furthermore, an extensive characterization study was carried out to ascertain the structure-activity relationship of the catalyst."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The chemicals used for the synthesis of Ni-loaded TiO2/MMT-clay nanocomposites were Titanium (IV) Isopropoxide (97%, Sigma-Aldrich) as a source of titanium (IV), isopropanol (99.8%, QRëC), acetic acid (99.8%, QRëC), MMT (Bentonite, Sigma-Aldrich) and Nickel (II) Nitrate Hexahydrate (Merck) as a source of nickel. The MMT/TiO2 nanocomposite catalyst was synthesized via single step sol-gel method according to our previous work [43]. The precursory of titanium solution was prepared with molar ratio; Ti (OCH (CH3)2)4: 15 C3H7OH: CH3COOH. Typically, 1 M acetic acid diluted in isopropanol was added drop wise into titanium solution of isopropanol for the hydrolysis process. Solution was stirred vigorously for 24 h at room temperature. Then, appropriate amount of MMT dispersed in isopropanol was added drop-wise into the titanium sol and the process of gelation was continued by stirring the mixture at room temperature for another 6 h until thick sol was formed. After aging, the slurry was dried in an oven at 110 °C for 24 h under airflow. The cake was finely ground and calcined in a furnace at a rate of 5 °C/min up to 500 °C and held at this temperature for 5 h. Finally, to synthesize Ni/MMT-TiO2 nano-composite, the impregnation method was used. An appropriate amount of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O was mixed together with MMT-TiO2 nano-composite in deionized water, stirred for 1 h and dried in an oven at 110 °C for 24 h under airflow. The sample was calcined at 500 °C for 5 h and named as Ni-MMT/TiO2 nanocomposites. Similarly, pure TiO2 and Ni-loaded TiO2 samples were to prepare without the addition of MMT. All the samples were calcined at 500 °C for 5 h to get anatase phase TiO2, which is more active for H2 production [44]."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Crystalline structure and phase transformation analysis of samples were undertaken by X-ray diffraction (XRD), performed on Bruker D 8 advance diffractometer (Cu-kα radiation, λ = 1.54 Å, operated at 40 kV and 40 mA) at a rate of 1 min−1 from 2θ = 1.5° to 80°. BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) surface area, average pore volume and pore diameters were determined by N2 adsorption examined at −196 °C. All the samples were degasified at 250 °C for four hours under vacuum conditions. BET analysis was carried out by micrometrics 3Flex Version 3.01. The microstructures, surface morphology and quantitative elemental analysis of the catalyst were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (EDX). Carl Zeiss Supra 35 VP SEM and Oxford instruments were used respectively. The morphology of spent catalyst was inspected using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) employing a JEOL JSM6390 LV SEM. To monitor the extent of coke deposition on catalyst, fresh and spent catalyst particle sample were subjected to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), performed by a TGA 8000 system from PerkinElmer instruments."
4,Experimental set-up and procedure,"2.3 Experimental set-up and procedure Experimental set up consisted of a feed, reaction and analysis section as shown in Fig. 1 . The feed to the reactor was a gas mixture of water (DI), ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 95.0%) and nitrogen (99.99%). Water-ethanol mixture was fed to an evaporator, operated at 150 °C through a syringe pump (KDS-100), operated at 2 ml/h. N2 was introduced as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 40 ml/min, except for tests of space velocity. The evaporator was connected to the reactor through stainless steel tubes and connectors, maintained at 130 °C by use of a heating tape to prevent condensation. The ESR reactions were carried out isothermally in a borosilicate glass tube, which can be used at a maximum temperature of 550 °C. The catalytic bed, realized by sandwiching the powder catalyst (0.5 g, diluted in quartz, with catalyst to inert weight ratio 1:1) between quartz wool, was located in the annular section of the reactor (8 mm i.d. and 29 cm length). The reactor was placed in a three zone horizontal tube furnace (CARBOLITE, MTF 10/15/130) which was monitored by a programmable temperature controller. “K type” thermocouples were used to measure the temperature of the catalytic bed inside the reactor; in particular, in correspondence of the inlet, the middle and the outlet of the catalytic bed. The analysis section consisted of an online GC (Agilent 6890N network GC system) for product gas samples and an offline GC (Agilent 7820A GC system) for liquid samples. For online GC, the FID detector was connected with an HP-PLOT Q capillary column (Agilent, length 30 m. ID 0.53 mm, film 40 μm) for separation of C1–C6 hydrocarbons, alcohols and oxygenated compounds. The TCD detector was connected to UCW982, DC-200, Porapak Q and Mol Sieve 13 X columns for detection of C1–C5 compounds and light gases (H2, O2, N2, CO). The catalytic performance was evaluated through the conversion of ethanol (Xethanol), selectivity (S) and yield towards the main products (H2, CO2, CH4 and CO) and minor/negligible products (C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, C3H8, CH3CHO, CH3COOH, (C2H5)2O and (CH3)2CO), as listed in Table 1 ."
5,Thermodynamic analysis,"Thermodynamic analysis (TDA) studies have shown the feasibility of H2 production from ESR. The Gibbs reactor simulates a chemical reactor by solving heat and mass balances on minimizing the free energy of components that can be produced during a reforming process [45]. The equilibrium constants of the various side reactions was used to evaluate the feasibility of occurrence of these reactions at different temperatures. Gibbs free energy change of reaction ( Δ G r 0 ) for each reaction at different temperature was calculated by Eq. (4). (4) Δ G r 0 = ∑ i γ i Δ G f i 0 where ( γ i ) is the stoichiometric coefficient and ( Δ G f i 0 ) is the Gibbs free energy of formation of species (i). The equilibrium constant (K) is usually determined by Eq. (5) or by Van’t-Hoff Eq. (6) [46]. (5) K ′ = exp ( - Δ G r 0 / RT ) (6) ln K K ′ = - Δ H r 0 R 1 T - 1 T ′ where the standard enthalpy of reaction is ( Δ H r 0 ) , ( T ′ ) and ( T ) are reference and arbitrary temperature, while ( K ′ ) is equilibrium constant at reference temperature. In this study, Eq. (6) was modified as shown in Eq. (7), to predict the values of (ln K) as a function of (T). (7) ln K = - Δ H r 0 R 1 T - 1 T ′ + ln K ′ For each reaction, values of (ln K) were quantized and plotted against temperature. The total Gibbs free energy of a system is given by the sum of (i) species as expressed in Eq. (8). (8) G t = ∑ i = 1 N n i G i 0 + RT ∑ i = 1 N n i ln f i f i 0 where ( G t ) is the total Gibbs free energy, ( G i 0 ) is standard Gibbs free energy of species (i), (R) is the molar gas constant. (T) is the temperature of the system, ( f i ) is fugacity of species (i) in the system, ( f i 0 ) is standard state fugacity of species (i) and ( n i ) is the number of moles of species (i). For gas phase reaction equilibrium, ( G i 0 = Δ G f i 0 ) is assumed. When solid carbon is involved in the reaction, the minimization function of Gibbs energy is modified as per Eq. (9), [47] . (9) ∑ i = 1 N - 1 n i Δ G f i 0 + RT ln y i ϕ i P P 0 + ∑ λ k a ik + n C Δ G fC ( s ) 0 = 0 The ESR model is simulated using ChemCAD v.6.3 simulation software, based on Gibbs free energy minimization method (GFEM), to estimate the equilibrium compositions at given temperature and pressure [48]. All species involved were input in the feed stream at a temperature ( T ′ ) of 298 K. Feed stream was maintained in gas phase by the preheater. The Gibbs reactor was set to isothermal condition at arbitrary temperature (T). TDA was carried out in two parts: Evaluation of feasible reactions by equilibrium constants, in which a total of twenty possible reactions were considered for evaluation as listed in Table 2 . For each reactant and product, values of Δ H f 0 and Δ G f 0 were obtained from the literature from [56]. Reference temperature of 298 K was selected, while arbitrary temperature was set from 573 to 1473 K to evaluate (ln K). For all simulations, the feed or reactants temperature was kept constant at 423 K."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Thermodynamic analysis,"4.1 Thermodynamic analysis TDA analysis involved the determination of equilibrium rate constants for the reactions of ESR and estimation of equilibrium compositions at various conditions of temperature, pressure and feed ratios. The main reactions which may occur in ESR and computed values of enthalpy change and Gibbs free energy change of each reaction at 298 K are also tabulated in Table 2. When the Gibbs free energy change of reaction (ΔGr) is negative, the reaction is spontaneous. For positive (ΔGr), the reaction is thermodynamically limited. From the data in Table 2, ESR is a thermodynamically limited reaction that requires special conditions of temperature to occur. Equilibrium constant (K) determines the extent of reaction. When the value of K is much higher than 1, reaction equilibrium cannot be shifted by changing feed molar ratio. Variation of feed molar ratio only influences the distribution of products for reactions with a rate constant of 1 or close to 1. Furthermore, for spontaneous reactions, a larger ln (K) indicates a feasibility of occurrence. The equilibrium constants of all reactions that are predicted to occur are exhibited as a function of temperature in Fig. 2 . Summary of results and discussion of probable ESR reactions is given in Table 3 . The effect of temperature and pressure on the equilibrium EtOH conversion and H2 yield is shown in Fig. 3 . Reaction pressure has no effect on the EtOH conversion. However, increasing pressure results in lower H2 yield for temperatures below 900 °C. H2 yield remains constant with increasing temperature and pressure above 1000 °C. Atmospheric pressure gives the highest H2 yield and similar observations has been reported previously [26]. Evidently, H2 yield attains a maximum value between 600 and 700 °C and a pressure of 1 atm. Results of TDA in Fig. 4 show EtOH conversion, yield and selectivity of main products at different temperatures, atmospheric pressure and molar feed ratio 10:1. EtOH conversion is not thermodynamically limited over the entire temperature range. Methanation reaction (Rxn# 14 and 15), which is exothermic, is favored at temperatures below 700 °C, in agreeance with information in Table 3. At higher temperature, steam reforming of CH4 to CO2 and H2 is favored. While high temperature minimized CH4 concentration in product gas, reverse-water-gas shift reaction is initiated (Rxn#18). CO formation becomes significant and subsequently, H2 yield drops [25]. For the given S/E feed ratio of 10:1 and atmospheric pressure, there is possibly no solid carbon formation at equilibrium state [26]. Fig. 5 shows the effect of steam-to-ethanol (S/E) feed molar ratio on H2 yield and carbon selectivity at atmospheric pressure. Highest H2 yield is observed at S/E ratio of 10:1. At high S/E ratios, increase in water concentration favors both reverse methanation and reverse WGS reactions by shifting equilibrium to the left, resulting in more hydrogen production [26]. For equimolar feed ratios, solid carbon formation is favored at temperatures below 1000 °C. No carbon was formed for S/E feed ratios above 2:1. At lower S/E feed ratios, the increased molar composition of ethanol results in increased carbon formation and lower H2 yield [48]. Since the experimental work used N2 as a carrier gas, the effect of this dilution was studied by TDA. As shown in Fig. 6 , inert gas dilution increases H2 yield at low temperature (<700 °C), while it exhibits no effect at high temperature. At low temperature, the dominant reaction is methanation/methane steam reforming (MSR), whereas at high temperature, reverse water gas shift reaction dominated. Dilution influences the methanation and MSR reactions but has no effect on the reverse WGS reaction since there is no change in the number of moles with extent of this reaction. In ESR, oxygenated carbons occur in the form of CO and CO2, which could results in coke formation. This study evaluated CO2 distribution for different reaction conditions of temperature and feed molar ratios at atmospheric conditions, by the ratio (CO2/COx). For equimolar feed, equal molar amounts of CO and CO2 are produced at 600 °C as depicted in Fig. 7 . While CO2 formation is favored at low temperature, CO formation is favored at high temperature [49]. High S/E molar feed ratios result in higher concentration of CO2 at elevated temperature. This is because the main ESR reaction which produces CO2 is favored by both higher temperature and higher S/E molar feed ratios. For low S/E feed ratios, variation from 1:1, 1:5 to 1:10 has negligible effect on CO2/COx ratio. The increased molar concentration of C from EtOH leads to coke formation instead of increased amounts of CO and CO2 [48]. From TDA of feasible reactions at given temperature range, reaction number three (Rxn#3) from Table 2 is the only spontaneous reaction. All other reactions are feasible and hence product distribution in ESR varies greatly depending on the temperature. Optimum equilibrium conditions obtained from TDA are pressure 1 atm, temperature 600–700 °C and molar feed ratio 10:1. The inert dilution ratio (I/S/E) 25:10:1 is favorable for H2 production instead of ESR without N2 dilution at lower temperature. The different dilution ratios were not tested as they will change composition and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of feed gas. Furthermore, as observed under analysis of CO2 distribution, these conditions for EtOH conversion, H2 yield and selectivity, equally favor CO and CO2 formation."
8,Experimental evaluation of thermodynamic parameters,"4.2 Experimental evaluation of thermodynamic parameters All the experiments were conducted at fixed N2 flow of 40 mL/min with inert dilution ratio (I/S/E) 25:10:1 and atmospheric pressure. The reaction temperature was varied from 300 to 500 °C and S/E feed ratios of 10:1 to 1:10 were used, while catalyst stability analysis was evaluated at optimized reaction conditions. Initially, a primary test on ESR without catalyst (homogeneous) was carried out. For a S/E feed molar ratio of 10:1, feed flow of 2 ml/h, N2 flow of 40 ml/min, 1 atm. pressure and 500 °C temperature, a high H2 selectivity of 62% was observed as depicted in Fig. 8 (a). In addition, in homogeneous system, without using catalyst, both ethanol conversion and as a result, H2 yield were extremely low at 0.55 and 0.34%, respectively. During catalyst screening, effect of Ni loading was the first parameter to be studied. Nickel loading was varied from 7 to 15 wt%, while the influence of MMT addition to TiO2 support was evaluated at 10 and 20 wt%. H2 selectivity was constant for all loadings at approximately 70%, as depicted in Fig. 8(b). 12% Ni loading gave the best performance in terms of H2 yield and ethanol conversion, thus considered an optimal loading, as depicted in Table 4 . Furthermore, performance of 12% Ni loading TiO2 with 20% MMT addition exhibited the optimum comparative results on performance, where ethanol conversion reached to 83.78% at H2 yield of 51.68% and selectivity ∼66%. This can be attributed to more active sites and efficient Ni dispersion over MMT dispersed TiO2 catalyst, resulting in enhanced process efficiency and similar observations have been reported previously [41]. Besides catalyst screening, the performance of system on the basis of ethanol conversion, H2 yield, and product selectivity is also critical. From Fig. 8(c), on addition of MMT to Ni/TiO2, selectivity of valuable CH4 increased significantly while that towards CO dropped. The drop in both H2 and CO selectivity may be due to promotion of the methanation reaction (Rxn#14), which converts both CO and H2 to CH4 [50]. Methanation reaction is an endothermic reaction and thus is favored by the high temperature, possibly due to specific structure of MMT which can also convert carbon species by hydrogen to CH4 and similar observations were reported previously [51]. Furthermore, MMT addition could not altered selectivity with preference toward methane formation. The decreased in H2 selectivity is not significant compared with improved conversion and yield over the composite catalyst than using Ni/TiO2 NPs (Table 4). Therefore, based on results from screening, 12% Ni/20% MMT/TiO2 catalyst is most efficient for H2 production with improved EtOH conversion and H2 yield and can be further used to investigate the process parameters. The conversion of ethanol and product yield at different temperatures and at a feed molar ratio (S/E = 10:1) was compared and the results are presented in Table 5 . Ethanol conversion was very low at 300 °C but increased progressively with the increase in temperature, reaching a high of 88.85% at 500 °C. These results agree well with previously reported work [17,52,53]. According to thermodynamic, ethanol conversion is independent of temperature and 100% conversion could be achieved at lower temperature, yet it is not verified experimentally. Compounds such as C2H4 and C2H6 had higher yields than CH4, CO and CO2 at temperatures below 500 °C. This occurrence can be attributed to side reactions such as ethanol dehydration (Rxn#8), which is exothermic and thus favored by lower temperature. Thermodynamically, probable compounds such as CH3COOH (Rxn#4), CH3CHO (Rxn#5), C2H5OC2H5 (Rxn#9) and CH3COCH3 (Rxn#13) were not detected, most likely because they could have been undergoing rapid reforming upon formation. The concentration of CO increased monotonously as expected, from the water-gas-shift (WGS) reaction (Rxn#18), shift in equilibrium to the left, with the increased in temperature. The H2 yield (%) was at 54.54%, close to the value of 64% predicted by TDA. This revealed that Ni/MMT-TiO2 catalyst is efficient and can be used in ESR process for H2 production at low reaction temperature. Fig. 9 depicts selectivity of H2 and CO2/COx ratio at different temperature and time on stream. Evidently, H2 yield increased while selectivity dropped with an increase in temperature. According to TDA, H2 selectivity can be increased at temperature <600 °C but it is independent of temperature at higher temperature, yet it is not verified experimentally. This can be attributed to the fact that, besides high temperature favouring the main ESR reaction, other side reactions such as acetaldehyde decomposition (Rxn#6) and methanation/reverse water gas shift reaction (Rxn#15), which are endothermic, were also promoted. Both these reactions result in production of valuable CH4 but in acetaldehyde decomposition, CO is also formed (Rxn#6). CO formation at increasing temperature is further emphasized by evaluating the CO2/COx ratio. At 400 °C, CO2 dominates but CO starts to form with increasing temperature. At 500 °C, CO2/CO = 9:1, showing the commencement of CO formation. Therefore, it is confirmed that high temperature promoted CO formation, although yield of CO production depends on type of catalyst and similarly analyzed by thermodynamic analysis. Fig. 10 shows ethanol conversion, H2 selectivity and product yield as a functions of molar feed ratios. From Fig. 10(a), it can be observed that ethanol conversion decreases with an increase in feed molar ratio. This indicates that water is preferentially adsorbed on the catalyst. In other words, water competes with ethanol for similar “active sites” on the catalyst surface. The presence of large amounts of water at high S/E feed molar ratio (10:1) hinders the adsorption of ethanol, while shifting the equilibrium for ethanol dehydrative coupling reaction to the left, hence decreasing the ethanol conversion. Ethanol dehydrative coupling, an endothermic reaction (Rxn # 9), is plausible, feasible and favored at 500 °C. While high feed molar ratios were synonymous with lower ethanol conversion, the high amount of water and low amount of ethanol favored H2 selectivity and results are presented in Fig. 10(b). H2 selectivity is mainly affected by the increase in production of side products. Lowering the S/E feed molar ratio from 10:1 to 1:10 resulted in an approximate 45% drop in H2 selectivity. This can be attributed to the fact that an increase of ethanol fraction in feed composition at 500 °C promotes endothermic side reaction of ethanol decomposition (Rxn#11), which promotes yields of side products CH4 and CO, thus reducing overall H2 selectivity. These experimental results are supported by thermodynamic analysis. Water inhibits the ethanol decomposition reaction by channelling ethanol reactivity towards the main ESR reaction. This point is supported by the high CO2/COx ratio (≈0.9) at high S/E (10:1) feed molar ratio. CO2 dominates at high S/E ratio (10:1) while CO dominates at low S/E feed molar ratio (1:10) [45]. Fig. 10(c) shows the yield of significant products; H2, CO2, CH4, and CO in relation to the feed molar ratio. H2 and CO2 yield progressively decreased as the feed molar ratio (S/E) was reduced from 10:1 to 1:10. However, yield of valuable CH4 and undesirable CO increased. This observation can be linked to the promotion of methanation (Rxn#15) and ethanol decomposition reactions (Rxn#11-13) by higher ethanol fraction in feed. It further demonstrates that the high ethanol conversion exhibited by low feed molar ratio (S/E = 1:10) did not translate to higher H2 yield but resulted in production of more CH4 and CO. To best compare the performance of the optimum catalyst, results of catalytic study were compared to those of TDA data under similar conditions. From results listed in Table 6 , it can be seen that the 12% Ni/20% MMT-TiO2 catalyst performed excellently. The development of stable catalyst is one of the most important issues in the production of H2 from steam reforming of ethanol, particularly since there is no oxygen (partial oxidation) available to remove carbon deposits that are detrimental to the catalytic stability. Results of stability test for ethanol conversion, H2 selectivity and yield are shown in Fig. 11 . H2 selectivity approached steady state before both ethanol conversion and H2 yield because of its temperature dependent nature in ESR. Over 20 h of reaction time, minimal variations in overall activity were observed while high values were maintained. Ethanol conversion, H2 selectivity and yield were at an average of 89, 62 and 55%, respectively. Furthermore, during time on stream, the curves for conversion and yield rate take longer time to stabilize (reached to equilibrium). The prolonged time to reach stability was probably due to porous MMT structure in Ni/TiO2 composite sample, where the adsorption and desorption process was not at equilibrium in the beginning of the ESR reaction. However, at prolonged time on stream, it finally reached to stead state and promoted continuous production of H2. Previously, similar observations have been reported [54,55]. Therefore, significantly enhanced catalytic activity and stability toward H2 production from ESR was due to structured MMT-dispersed TiO2 with enhanced Ni-dispersion."
9,Catalyst characterization,"4.3 Catalyst characterization The XRD patterns of TiO2, MMT, Ni/TiO2 and Ni/MMT-TiO2 samples are exhibited in Fig. 12 . Prepared TiO2 was in pure anatase phase with 101 peak located at 2-theta of 25.62°. Ni loaded TiO2 reflects similar peaks but of a lower intensity. The XRD pattern of MMT showed basal (0 0 1) reflection around 2θ = 3.70°, due to layered clay structure. In case of 20% MMT loading on Ni/TiO2, the diffraction peaks were wider and weaker than those of catalysts prepared without MMT. Ni and TiO2 containing MMT samples had dissimilar XRD patterns compared to the pure MMT. MMT peak (0 0 1) is present in the pure MMT sample but disappears in the Ni/MMT-TiO2 samples due to dispersion of MMT on TiO2 particles. Furthermore, this could be an indication that the original layers of MMT were destroyed and thinly deposited on TiO2. For Ni/MMT-TiO2, diffraction peaks are almost equivalent, exhibiting 2θ peaks at 25.318°, 37.811°, 48.053°, 53.916°, 55.057° and 62.716°, which are consistent with (1 0 1), (0 0 4), (2 0 0), (1 0 5), (2 1 1) and (2 0 4) planes associated with tetragonal anatase. A Ni peak is present in Ni/TiO2 and Ni/MMT-TiO2 samples but absent in bare TiO2 and MMT samples. This has confirmed that Ni is presented in all the Ni-loaded TiO2 and MMT/TiO2 catalyst samples and similar observations have been reported previously [56]. Furthermore, a gradual decreased in crystallite size of TiO2 obtained with addition of Ni and MMT. The crystallite size of 19 nm was obtained for TiO2, reduced to 17, 11 and 11 nm in MMT, Ni and Ni/MMT loaded TiO2 samples, respectively. The morphology and microscopic structure of catalysts was investigated using SEM as illustrated in Fig. 13 . Spherical particles with almost uniform size for TiO2 is shown in Fig. 13(a). The SEM images in Fig. 13(b) show MMT sheets and layers being almost smooth and uniform in shape, respectively. Fig. 13(c) illustrates the SEM images of the Ni/MMT-TiO2 catalyst. The catalyst shows both MMT sheets and TiO2 nano-particles, thus creating a nano-composite. TiO2 particles are almost spherical in shape and uniform in size. It is impossible to identify Ni due to its small weight percentage and its uniform dispersion on MMT sheets and layers. Fig. 13(d) shows EDX mapping analysis of Ni/MMT-TiO2 catalyst. Evidently, uniform distribution of Ni over MMT/TiO2 support could be seen, confirming successful synthesis of composite using modified sol-gel method. N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms and the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution of the calcined Ni/TiO2 and Ni/MMT-TiO2 composite are exhibited in Fig. 14 . From Fig. 14(a), the isotherms of the samples are similar to type IV curves with hysteresis loops, corresponding to mesoporous materials. BJH isotherms, Fig. 14(b), shows that the pore diameter falls in the range of 5.54–183.77 nm and 5.45–277.38 nm for Ni/TiO2 and Ni/MMT-TiO2 samples, respectively. However, the bulk of the particles falls below 50 nm for both samples. The BET surface area, pore volume and pore size of Ni/TiO2 nanoparticles and Ni/MMT-TiO2 nanocomposites are summarized in Table 7 . MMT loading on Ni/TiO2 nano-particles barely affected the surface area of the TiO2 catalyst (15.464 ≈ 15.384 m2/g). This can be attributed to the fact that MMT could only dispersed Ni and TiO2 particles during intercalation process. In addition, BJH surface area in Ni/TiO2 samples is higher than Ni/MMT-TiO2 samples, obviously due to microporous structure of MMT. Furthermore, the slight decrease in mesoporous surface area on MMT addition could be assigned to the partial insertion of MMT particles, partly filling the structural and textural defects of the TiO2 support [23]. However, pore volume comparatively decreased while pore diameter reduced on MMT addition, probably due to MMT sheets being deposited on TiO2 pores."
10,Analysis of spent catalyst,"4.4 Analysis of spent catalyst To examine possible carbon deposition and catalyst particles structural changes during ethanol steam reforming, post-reaction characterization of 12% Ni/20% MMT-TiO2 composite catalyst sample was performed. TGA curves for the fresh and spent catalyst sample are shown in Fig. 15 (a). The degradation has occurred in three steps: first degradation occur from 50 to 150 °C, attributed to the removal of water from the surface (weight loss of about 1%). The second degradation is from 500 to 700 °C with ∼ 0.75 wt loss%, due to dehydration and removal of organic residues. The third degradation occurs beyond 900 °C, while total weight loss for the fresh catalyst was approximately 2.5%. Similarly, for the spent sample in Fig. 15(b), it can be observed that the spent sample (after 6 h reaction time) experiences an overall weight loss of around 12% from 50 to 1000 °C. The comparative extensive weight loss is an indication of loss of carbon from the catalyst surface at temperatures above 500 °C. However, both samples show single peaks for the% carbon curve, indicative of only one species of carbon being formed on the surface. Furthermore, the carbon peak for the reduced sample is sharper and steeper, occurring at temperatures above 700 °C, illustrating formation of a more stable carbon species after the ESR reaction. Fig. 16 depicts SEM micrographs and EDX analysis of spent Ni/MMT-TiO2 composite catalyst. The suggestive of coke deposition over the catalyst surface due to alteration of shape is presents in Fig. 16(a). The presence of coke over the support structure, evidencing in particular the presence of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) during ESR reaction for H2 production. This confirms that main coking mechanism is the formation of CNTs. Similar observation has been reported previously [57]. Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) analysis of spent catalyst at 500 °C shows peaks for Ti, O, C, Ni and Al within the detection limit as presented in Fig. 16(b). Si and Al are both constituents of montmorillonite, while the amount of C detected was approximately 23%. However, carbon lost in TGA analysis was approximately 12 wt%. This inconsistency was due to EDX analysis after 20 h reaction time compared to 6 h in TGA analysis. The occurrence of carbon species could be attributed to accumulation of coke in the form of CNTs, which may be due to ethanol dehydration to ethylene, polymerizing at low temperature if not efficiently gasified."
11,Conclusions,"A thermodynamic analysis followed by experimental verification for ESR for hydrogen production has been performed. High temperature, low pressure and high S/E molar feed ratio favors hydrogen production. The TDA revealed that best conditions for the production of hydrogen are temperature 600–700 °C, pressure 1 atm and molar feed ratio of water to ethanol. The Ni/MMT-TiO2 catalyst showed good activity at a temperature of 500 °C, yet H2 selectivity was somewhat reduced but yield was significantly improved. Comparatively, experimental results are near about to thermodynamic equilibrium. Although selectivity due to the catalyst formulation allowed for considerable reduction of CO formed, these temperatures still make ESR an energy intensive process. There is significant carbon deposition (CNTs) as indicated by TGA results and EDX analysis, but this has little effect on catalyst activity over 20 h of reaction time. In general, the catalyst sample demonstrated promising results for activity, selectivity and appreciable stability. Further catalytic modifications need to be researched to lower the temperature for which excellent ethanol conversion, H2 selectivity and yield can be achieved."
