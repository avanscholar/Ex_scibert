0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has potential as a renewable energy source because it is nontoxic, has high energy conversion efficiency, and yields nearly zero pollutant emissions. Nevertheless, conventional hydrogen production employs fossil fuels, yields considerable environmental pollutants, and consumes substantial electricity [1]. Therefore, an economically efficient and eco-friendly technique for hydrogen production is vital. Photocatalytic and electrocatalytic water splitting has been extensively investigated as a promising technology for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [2,3] and degradation of polluting dyes [4–6], yet limitations on quantum efficiency remain [1,7]. Recently, piezocatalysis has been achieved by using mechanical forces without consuming any additional electricity; thus, the piezocatalysis is a promising method in applications such as water pollutant degradation [8–11], bacterial disinfection [12], tumor therapy, and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [13,14]. In particular, the application of piezocatalysts can treat wastewater and produce clean energy through a natural mechanical energy (i.e., water pressure) under a dark environment, which is more convenient compared to photocatalysts for industrial applications. Noncentrosymmetric structures with unique piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties have great potential applications in electromechanical systems [15–17], nanodevices [18,19], self-powered sensors [20–22], piezocatalysis [23], and energy harvesting devices [24–28]. Notably, the exposed active edge sites of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) layers have attracted growing interest among researchers of hydrogen evolution and oxygen activation; such research has improved the performance of hybrid semiconductors and 2D TMDs in photocatalytic H2 production and the degradation of water pollutants [12,29,30]. However, the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs limits the photocatalytic HER of 2D TMDs [31]. MoS2 nanosheets with an odd number of layers have been theorized to be strongly piezoelectric [32], and piezocatalytic redox reactions that use few-layered 2D TMD nanosheets have led to promising new-generation catalyst designs for industrial applications. Of the various TMDs, we utilized MoS2 in the present study because of the high electron mobility of its hybrid of 1T and 2H phases and its promise as a piezocatalyst. Au nanoparticles (NPs) [33,34] can be used as photosensitizers to tune broad absorption bands from ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths through LSPR to suppress the recombination of electron–hole pairs for the application of the photodetector [19,35]. Thus, we investigated how LSPR interacted with the piezopotential effect for catalyzing the HER [36]. In the present study, we demonstrated that Au@MoS2 NFs promoted catalytic activity by generating hot electrons through LSPR within the Schottky barrier between Au and MoS2, and we further enhanced the rate of electron transfer with built-in strain-induced piezopotential. On the basis of the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements, the LSPR intensities of variously sized Au NPs indicated that with the assistance of the piezopotential derived from few-layered MoS2 NFs, the hydrogen production of the Au@MoS2 NFs exhibited the greatest LSPR effect. The results computed using density functional theory (DFT) and the finite element method (FEM) indicated that the magnitude of the electric field dramatically increased with mechanical strain on the Au@MoS2 NFs. This suggested that the large enhancement factor (EF) is related to the synergistic combination of LSPR and the piezophototronic effect. The effect yielded a considerable internal electric ﬁeld, and it played a crucial role in regulating the interfacial charge migration to trigger electrochemical reactions to produce H2."
1,Experimental section,
2,Material preparation,"2.1 Material preparation We synthesized MoS2 NFs through the same route used in our previous works [37]. First, Au NPs of sizes 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 nm were individually dispersed in solutions (BBI solutions). To prepare the Au@MoS2 NFs, 5 mL of each NP solution was individually mixed with 2 mmol L-cysteine (C3H7NO2S) and dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water, which was then stirred for 2 h to ensure the L-cysteine had encapsulated the Au NPs. Next, sodium molybdate dihydrate (Na2MoO4, Alfa Aesar) was added to each Au NP solution and sonicated for 20 min to form a precursor of Au NPs encapsulated by MoS2. The precursor was then poured into a 100 mL polytetrafluoroethylene-lined stainless-steel autoclave and dried in an oven at 200 °C for 12 h. Afterward, the product was dispersed in ethanol and decanted through centrifugation at 8000 rpm until transparent. Finally, the solution was dried at 60 °C to obtain the Au@MoS2 NFs with different Au NPs' sizes of 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 nm, we refer to as by AM5, AM10, AM20, AM40, AM60, and AM80, respectively."
3,Material characterization,"2.2 Material characterization The surface morphology and crystal structures of the as-synthesized samples were investigated by using a cold field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, HITACHI SU8010), high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-F200), and X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D2). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with a ULVAC-PHI 5000 Versaprobe II was used for chemical state analysis. We employed Raman spectroscopy (Horiba, iHR 550 s) with a He–Ne laser (632.8 nm) as an excitation source to observe the SERS spectra. A 375 nm diode laser (PicoQuant) was used for excitation laser to obtain the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the as-synthesized Au@MoS2 NFs. An ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer (UV-DRS, Hitachi, U3900) was used to obtain the absorption spectra of the as-synthesized Au@MoS2 NFs. We initiated the HER by using an ultrasonicator (Delta, DC300) and irradiation with a 200 W xenon lamp. The 10 mg catalysts were added into a solution of deionized water and methyl alcohol (in a 3:1 v/v ratio) as the sacrificial agent. Chromatographic analysis of hydrogen used a gas chromatograph (GC1000, TCD Model) and Ar as the carrier gas. Piezoelectric response force microscopy (PFM, Bruker Dimension ICON) allows imaging and manipulation of piezoelectric response of the MoS2 NFs and Au@MoS2 NFs."
4,Computational methods,"2.3 Computational methods We used Materials Studio (BIOVIA) simulation to calculate the optical properties of MoS2. A plane-wave pseudopotential Cambridge serial total energy package (CASTEP) package based on the DFT was used. For geometric optimization, we adopted generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional and ultrasoft pseudopotentials. A plane-wave cutoff energy of 400 eV and a Monkhorst–Pack mesh of 7 × 7 × 1 k points were used. GGA with the PBE exchange–correlation functional was also utilized to calculate the optical properties, and the pseudopotential approximation was performed by using norm-conserving pseudopotentials. The energy cutoff was set to 700 eV, and 12 × 12 × 1 k points were used. The FEM was employed in COMSOL Multiphysics to simulate the distribution of the electric field of the Au@MoS2 NFs with an electromagnetic wave model of simultaneous application of mechanical strains and light irradiation. The refractive index of MoS2 under different mechanical strains was calculated using DFT in Materials Studio."
5,Results and discussion,"A schematic illustration in Fig. 1a shows the concept of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) coupling with the piezophototronic effect to create a hot spot enhancement zone. Because the active catalytic sites that exhibit piezoelectric properties are on the edges of NFs [8], the Au NPs were coated with MoS2 NFs to prevent the passivation of MoS2 active sites. Fig. 1b illustrates the synthesis of the Au@MoS2 NFs. L-cysteine encapsulated the Au NPs and was further encapsulated by MoS2 NFs. Fig. 1c and d contain SEM images of MoS2 and Au@MoS2 NFs, respectively; the images display a flower-like morphology with abundant active sites. The XRD patterns in Fig. 1e show the commercial bulk MoS2, MoS2 NFs, and Au@MoS2 NFs. The bulk MoS2 possessed high crystallinity with a peak characteristic of hexagonal MoS2 (PDF#37-1492). Compared with bulk MoS2, weaker and broader peaks were observed at (002) for the MoS2 NFs, demonstrating the few-layered morphology forming around the edge sites [38]. The Au@MoS2 peak at (002) almost disappeared because of the imperfect stacking that resulted from uniaxial tensile strain along [001] (i.e., out-of-plane uniaxial tensile strain). However, the characteristic peaks at (111) and (200) were identified as Au signals (PDF#04-0784). Fig. 1f and its inset image present a low-magnification TEM image of Au@MoS2, illustrating the uniform dispersion of the Au NPs in the MoS2 NFs, reveals that the MoS2 NFs successfully encapsulated the Au NPs. Furthermore, Fig. 1g demonstrates that the higher number of exposed edge sites in the NF with an enlarged interlayer spacing of approximately 0.64 nm corresponded with the (002) planes of the MoS2 nanosheets [39]. In addition, the MoS2 NFs exhibited a stairs-like cracking defect (Fig. 1h) around the edge sites, suggesting that MoS2 with interlayer expansion is preferable for catalyzing the HER [40]. The TEM images of the 5, 10, 20, 60, and 80 nm Au NPs are displayed in Supporting information of Fig. S1. To obtain XPS depth profiles, we used an ion beam to etch layers of the surface and scanned the surface and at depths of 2.2 and 4.4 nm to reveal subsurface information about the Au@MoS2 NFs. Fig. 2a and b contain the depth profiles of Mo and S; the fitting intensity of Mo and S did not differ notably. The depth profile of Au (Fig. 2c) revealed that the Au surface intensity is negligible in comparison with the subsurface intensity and that the intensity of the Au NPs increases with the subsurface depth (Fig. 2d); this result demonstrates that MoS2 NFs successfully encapsulated the Au NPs, in good agreement with the high-resolution TEM observations. Because the signal of the Au NPs was weak on the surface, we examined both the MoS2 and Au@MoS2 XPS spectra at 4.4 nm depths to distinguish their binding energies. Fig. 2e and f and respectively display the Mo and S of the XPS spectra for the pristine MoS2 NFs, and Fig. 2g and h display those for the Au@MoS2 NFs. The Mo spectrum of both the MoS2 NFs and Au@MoS2 NFs exhibited the characteristic Mo4+ 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks of 1T MoS2 (pristine MoS2: 228.4 and 231.6 eV; Au@MoS2: 228.3 and 231.7 eV) and 2H MoS2 (MoS2: 229.1 and 232.3 eV; Au@MoS2: 229.1 and 232.3 eV) [41,42]. In addition, the formation of MoO2 and MoO3 observed in the Au@MoS2 (231.0, 233.9 eV) was greater than that observed in the MoS2 (233.4, 236.3 eV) [43]. Fig. 2f and h reveal that the S spectra had the characteristic S 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks of 1T (MoS2: 161.7 and 162.9 eV; Au@MoS2: 161.4 and 162.6 eV) and 2H MoS2 (MoS2: 162.2 and 163.4 eV; Au@MoS2: 161.9 and 163.1 eV) [41,42]. The spectra also revealed an additional contribution to Au@MoS2 from the thiol bond with Au (Au–S), whose respective peak positions were 162.5 and 163.7 eV at S 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 (Fig. 2h) [44,45]. We concluded that Au atoms replace Mo to bond with S, leading to differences between the S spectra of MoS2 and Au@MoS2, and subsequently, Mo atoms are oxidized, forming high-intensity bonds of MoO2. We employed piezoelectric force microscopy to investigate the piezoelectric characteristics of the MoS2 and Au@MoS2 NFs. Fig. 3a contains a height sensor image of the MoS2 NFs. A voltage is applied to the conductive tip during scanning on the surface of the NFs. Fig. 3b–d display the piezopotential outputs that resulted from the application of 3, 5, and 7 V; Fig. 3e presents the topography of the Au@MoS2; and Fig. 3f–h respectively display the piezopotential amplitude with driven voltages of 3, 5, and 7 V. The piezopotential increased with the generated deformation due to the piezoelectric response generated by the active sites of MoS2 NFs. In addition, the higher bias indicated that greater mechanical force was exerted on the samples' surface. The piezoresponse amplitude was consistent with the topography shown in the height sensor images, and its piezopotential response was proportional to the bias amplitude. Notably, the average piezopotential amplitude with driven voltages of 3, 5, and 7 V for Au@MoS2 was 16% higher than that for the pristine MoS2 NFs, suggesting that the coupling interfacial strain between the Au NPs and MoS2 NFs led to substantial piezoelectric charge in the heterostructures of these piezoelectric composites [46]. Fig. 4a presents the absorption peaks observed at 627 nm and 672 nm, corresponding to the A1 and B1 direct excitonic transitions of MoS2 [47,48]. The characteristic peak at 520 nm confirmed that LSPR influenced the absorbance spectrum of the Au NPs (20 nm) [49]. The absorbance spectrum of the Au@MoS2 was much broader than that of the pristine MoS2 NFs. This difference could be due to the higher density of states of Au@MoS2, which can increase the probability of charge transfer within the materials [50,51]. Furthermore, SERS spectra were utilized to investigate the electromagnetic field generated by the LSPR effect [52,53]. The EF was calculated using Eq. (1) to evaluate the Raman enhancement resulting from increased incident excitation. (1) E F SERS ω v = ∣ E out ( ω ) 2 ∣ ∣ E out ( ω − ω v ) 2 ∣ E 0 4 = I SERS ( ω v ) N surf I NRS ω v N vol where E out(ω) represents the electric field oscillating at frequency at which ω impinges on a molecule and results in Stokes' shifted Raman, Eout(ω − ω v ) [54]. The SERS enhancement intensity (I SERS) was normalized by the number of molecules bound to the substrate metal (N surf), divided by the classical Raman intensity (I NRS), and normalized by the number of molecules in the excitation volume (N vol ) [55]. Fig. 4b presents the SERS intensity of rhodamine (R6G) for substrates of Au@MoS2 with various Au NP sizes. The strong Raman bands of R6G observed at 1122, 1182, 1315, 1363, 1512, 1572, and 1652 cm−1 intensified after the introduction of Au NPs. The normalized EFs of pure R6G are shown in Fig. 4b. Although the electromagnetic field resulting from LSPR is greater for larger Au NPs [56,57], we found that the intensity decreased for NPs of ≥ 60 nm. This may be due to increased inelastic scattering of light [58]. Therefore, the optimal LSPR in this work was observed for the Au-40@MoS2 NFs. PL was used to determine the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers. The PL intensity can be increased through electric field enhancement by LSPR, which benefits from separating electrons and holes. Moreover, the Au NPs act as electron acceptors to provide a nonradiative means of modulating the recombination rate and lowering the PL intensity [59]. The peak at 565 nm (~ 2.19 eV) in Fig. 4c corresponds to the few-layered pristine MoS2 [60]. Compared with that of the pristine MoS2, the PL intensity of the Au@MoS2 NFs was lower for all NP sizes. This may occur because Au NPs act as electron trapping centers that prevent electrons excited to the conduction band from recombining with holes in the ground state [61]. However, the PL intensity was not significantly associated with Au NP size. Fig. 4d, e illustrate the hydrogen evolution rate under light irradiation, demonstrating hydrogen production of approximately 408 μmol g−1 h−1 for Au-40@MoS2 NFs, which was higher than that of the pristine MoS2 NFs (322 μmol g−1 h−1); this result suggests that the LSPR effect can considerably enhance hydrogen production. Additionally, the performance of the catalysts greater with the addition of the Au NPs. Fig. 4f, g, under ultrasonic vibration, the hydrogen evolution rate increased from 2848 μmol g−1 h−1 for the pristine MoS2 NFs to 3707 μmol g−1 h−1 for the Au-60@MoS2 NFs. However, the contributions of each size of Au NP were nearly indistinguishable, suggesting that the improvement of the amount of hydrogen gas resulted from the low recombination rate and that the piezocatalytic HER was not dependent on the Au NP size [62]. Notably, Fig. 4e and g indicate that the dramatic increase in the amount of hydrogen gas in the pristine MoS2 NFs dramatically increased from 322 μmol g−1 h−1 to 2848 μmol g−1 h−1 under light irradiation and ultrasonic vibration, respectively, indicating that the piezocatalytic HER was superior to the photocatalytic HER. In contrast, the results of simultaneous application of light and ultrasonic vibration are displayed in Fig. 4h, i. The hydrogen evolution rate of Au@MoS2 increased from 2981 to 4808 μmol g−1 h−1, 161% that of the pristine MoS2 NFs. Crucially, the hydrogen evolution rate was strongly related to the electromagnetic field intensity, as observed from the SERS spectra (Fig. 4b), evidenced that the piezocatalytic HER can be significantly enhanced by LSPR. Fig. 5a–f are schematics of the working mechanisms of the photocatalytic, piezocatalytic and LSPR coupling with piezophototronic effect. Fig. 5b shows that after the Fermi level reached equilibrium, a Schottky barrier formed at the interface between MoS2 (n-type) and Au [63], indicating that hot electrons excited by light can pass through the barrier [64]. In this process, photoelectrons are generated and excited to the conduction band of MoS2. Because of the LSPR effect, the electric field near the NP surface is greatly enhanced, and the optical absorption of Au NPs peaks at the plasmon resonant frequency, which enhances the redox reaction on the surface of Au@MoS2. However, the pristine MoS2 NFs generally presented low photocatalytic activity for H2 production due to the indirect band gap, which favors rapid nonradiative relaxation in the form of phonons (heat) to increase electron–hole pair recombination [65,66]. Under ultrasonic vibration, the piezopotential of MoS2 was induced and regarded as exerting bias on the Schottky barrier at the interface between Au and MoS2. The piezoelectric heterojunction, with built-in potential ψ bi , and the piezocharges are presented in Eq. (2) [67–69]. (2) ψ bi = q 2 ε s ( N A W Dp 2 + ρ piezo W piezo 2 + N D W Dn 2 ) (3) ψ bi = q 2 ε s ( ρ piezo W piezo 2 + N D W Dn 2 ) where q is the absolute value of unit electron charge, ε s is the permittivity of the material, ρ piezo represents the density of the strain-induced piezocharges, W piezo is the width of the piezocharges, and W Dp and W Dn are the widths of depletion layer on the p-side and the n-side, respectively. N A and N D respectively represent the concentrations of acceptors and donors. Eq. (2) can be rewritten as Eq. (3) for n-type semiconductor–metal contact. Thus, strain can further modulate the depletion layer of the Schottky barrier. That is, the higher the density of the strain-induced piezocharges ( ρ piezo ), the higher the built-in potential ψ bi is because of the large depletion layer, indicating that strain on Au@MoS2 NFs induces piezopotential, which can be used as a bias. The sign of the bias depends on the direction of the strain polarization. Therefore, Fig. 5c reveals that when the piezoelectric polarization of MoS2 was pointed to the left, electrons were injected from the MoS2 into the Au under the driving force of the polarization. By contrast, when the polarization of MoS2 was to the right, the electron flow into the metal was suppressed because of the thicker depletion zone (Fig. 5d). The Au@MoS2 NFs were immersed in sacrificial agents, allowing the redox reaction to proceed on both sides despite the difference in polarization direction, thus helping to prevent recombination and improving overall efficiency. A synergistic effect of piezocatalysis and photocatalysis was produced through combined application of light irradiation and ultrasonic vibration. Fig. 6e shows that piezopotential promoted the excitation of electrons by photons but that these electrons were trapped by Au more efficiently instead of recombining with photogenerated holes. Fig. 6f demonstrates that the potential barrier height for electron diffusion from a semiconductor was higher when the polarization was to the right; thus, the hot electrons from the Au were more likely to be injected into the MoS2. Furthermore, the piezoelectric effect assists in inducing more hot electrons, enhancing the tunneling effect, and the piezophotocatalytic performance of water splitting depends on the LSPR effect, as observed from the SERS spectra (Fig. 4c). To explain the contribution of piezoelectricity to the LSPR effect, Eq. (4) describes the electric field resulting from strain-induced piezocharges, wherein E m is the maximum field that exists in the interface [67]. Eqs. (5) and (6) are derived from E = − ∇ ϕ and help to realize the electric field distribution of a metal NP. E 0 is the amplitude of the electric field; ε NP and ε m represent the dielectric permittivity of the metal NP and of the surrounding medium, respectively; and r represents the module of the position vector. Herein, ϕ out is the superposition of the applied field and the dipole within metal NPs [70]. (4) E m = q ( N D W Dn + ρ piezo W piezo ) ε s (5) ϕ in = − 3 ε NP ε NP + 2 ε m E 0 rcos θ (6) ϕ out = − E 0 rcos θ + ε NP − ε m ε NP + 2 ε m E 0 d 2 3 cos θ r 2 Eqs. (4)–(6) reveal that the dipole moment of metal NPs is subject to electric-field-induced strain, indicating that the dipolar excitation could be enhanced to promote the HER of Au@MoS2 through LSPR and piezopotential. On the basis of our SERS and HER results, we believe that that the Au@MoS2 NFs increased the probability of hot electron transfer under the LSPR effect, creating a piezophotocatalytic system in the Au@MoS2 to produce a considerable number of electrons that can reduce water and generate hydrogen. We assumed an electromagnetic wave (e.g., sun light) was propagated along the x-direction and utilized computational simulation to demonstrate the performance of synergistic piezophotocatalysis. The theoretical calculation of Au@MoS2 model is presented in Fig. 6a. A gold NP is sandwiched between two monolayer MoS2. We used Materials Studio to perform geometric optimization and to calculate optical properties using the CASTEP module based on DFT. The tensile strain on MoS2 was 0%, 1%, and 2%. The optical properties were derived from the dielectric equation and were converted into a refractive index. Afterward, a Au@MoS2 electric field under strain and light irradiation was simulated by using electromagnetic waves and the frequency domain in COMSOL Multiphysics. The dielectric constant is required to calculate how the electric field is affected by the refractive index of MoS2 under different strains; this constant was determined through DFT calculation. The computational results shown in Fig. 6b–d correspond to MoS2 with a tensile strain ratio of 0%, 1%, and 2%, respectively. The absolute maximum electric field (abs E x ) is labeled in Fig. 6c, d. Strains of 0%, 1%, and 2% corresponded to electric field strengths of 3.8, 3.91, and 4.01 V m−1, respectively. The comparison of theoretical calculation of abs E x for the tensile and compressive strain was shown in Fig. 6e, which indicated the electric field strength induced by tensile strain is significantly higher than that induced by compressive tensile. The reason is attributed to the bending moment effect [71]. That is, a displacement ( δ ) was created when mechanical bending is applied along the z-axis of the single-layer MoS2 nanosheets. The MoS2 suffered from a tensile strain, on increasing the bending moment, an extraordinary potential results along the z-axis. Accordingly, the electric field originated from the LSPR effect of Au increased with the MoS2 strain, indicating that the dielectric constant of MoS2 varied with structural deformation and played a crucial role in the LSPR caused by the Au. The simulation results support the synergy of the LSPR and the piezophototronic effect that promotes catalytic activity for H2 production."
6,Conclusion,"The Au@MoS2 NFs exhibited a piezoelectric response at the edge sites of the MoS2 NFs, which when combined with the LSPR effect, produced a synergistic piezophotocatalytic effect. The heterostructured nanocomposites were employed to induce the HER and demonstrated excellent performance. When light irradiation and ultrasonic vibration were simultaneously applied, the yield of hydrogen gas by the 40 nm Au@MoS2 NFs was 161% that by pristine MoS2 NFs. In piezophotocatalysis, Au and MoS2 formed a Schottky barrier that drastically reduced the recombination rate. Moreover, the band structure of MoS2 was deformed by the piezopotential acting as a bias to modulate the Schottky barrier, inducing the injection of considerable hot electrons into the MoS2 through LSPR to increase the catalytic activity. The theoretical calculations, based on the outcomes of electromagnetic wave simulations of strained MoS2 NFs, further demonstrated that the synergy of LSPR and the piezophotonic effect present potential strategies for water-splitting catalysis and benefits to the field of renewable energy through H2 production."
