1,Materials,"1.1 Materials Nickel nitrate Ni(NO3)2.6H2O, lanthanum nitrate La(NO3)3.6H2O, tin tetrachloride SnCl4, potassium hydroxide KOH were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ethanol was purchased from Biopack. All chemicals were reagent-grade and were used as received."
2,Catalyst synthesis,"1.2 Catalyst synthesis Nix-La-Sn mixed oxides (x=5 and 15% weight of Ni) with a La/Sn atomic ratio=1 were prepared by coprecipitacion with KOH. Lanthanum nitrate, nickel nitrate and tin tetrachloride were dissolved together in distilled water and the precipitation was made by the addition of an aqueous solution of KOH (1 molL−1) until the pH reached 12. The precipitate thus obtained was repeatedly washed with distilled water (final conductivity below 120μScm−2) to remove undesirable ions (NO3 −, K+, Cl−), dried overnight at 100°C, calcined in air at 500°C for 24h and calcined at final temperatures between 700 and 950°C for 2h. The solids were crushed and sieved to a final particle size between 63 and 88 micrometers for further use. The catalysts thus obtained were named NixLaSnT where T is the final calcination temperature. LaSn mixed oxides (LaSnT) were prepared by the same method."
3,Catalyst characterization,"1.3 Catalyst characterization The fresh and used catalysts were characterized on an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Ultima IV) fitted with a CuKα (λ=1.5418Å) source and coupled to a data acquisition system. BET surface area, pore volume and pore size were determined based on nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms at −196°C obtained with a Beckman-Coulter SA 3100. Before and after use in reforming tests, catalysts were subject to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) with a Shimadzu TGA-50 under 50mLmin−1 air flow, with temperature increasing from 20°C to 950°C at a rate of 5°Cmin−1. The carbonaceous residue was analyzed for its carbon content by elemental analysis (Carlo Erba EA1108 CHNS-0). The nature of the carbon and other phases formed after reaction and other surface species were characterized by Raman spectroscopy (WiTec-300RA). Catalysts micro-structure was studied by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) (Jeol HR-STEM JEM 2100 LaB6 200kV with a camera CCD Gatan Orius 1000)."
4,Catalytic tests,"1.4 Catalytic tests Steam reforming tests were performed at atmospheric pressure in a fixed bed continuous flow quartz reactor (10mm i.d.) heated by a temperature-controlled electrical furnace. The liquid reaction mixture (ethanol:water at a 1:9 molar ratio) was fed with a syringe pump (Cole Parmer 74900 Series) into a heated chamber upstream of the reactor where it vaporized and mixed with a flow of Ar as carrier gas stabilized by means of a mass flow controller (Aalborg AFC Series). The catalyst (0.10g) was first subject to in situ reduction under a 20mLmin−1 pure hydrogen flow by heating from room temperature to 650°C, at rate of 10°Cmin−1 and keeping the final temperature for 1h. Following reduction, the H2 flow was stopped and the reactor purged with argon at a flow rate of 20mLmin−1. Tests were run using 0.10g catalyst, a 20mLmin−1 argon flow rate, a 5.58×10−5 molmin−1 ethanol feed, and a 1/9/14.3 ethanol/water/argon molar ratio (GHSV 41,000h−1). The reaction temperature was kept constant throughout the run. The gaseous mixture containing argon and reaction products was passed by a cold trap (–70°C) for condensation of non-reacted ethanol and reaction intermediates, mainly acetaldehyde and acetone, in addition to excess water, replacing the trap every 4h of reaction time. Non-condensable reaction products, mainly H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2 (ethane and ethylene) and C3 (propane and propylene) hydrocarbons, were analyzed on a gas-chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-14B) equipped with FID and TCD detectors in series and with Supelco CarboxenTM-1000 and Porapak Q columns. The liquid phase of products retained in the cold traps were analyzed at the end of the run by high pressure liquid chromatography (Shimadzu CTO-20A/20AC) with RID detector and a Rezex RHM-monosaccharide H+ column. Ethanol conversion (Xethanol), product selectivity (Si) and product yields (Yi) were determined as follows: X e t h a n o l = F e t h a n o l I N − F e t h a n o l O U T F e t h a n o l I N x 100 S i = F i ∑ F i x 100 Y i = F i F e t h a n o l I N where Fi is the molar flow of product i (i=H2, CO, CO2, CH4, acetaldehyde, acetone, C2 and C3)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"2.1 Catalyst characterization 2.1.1 Adsorption-desorption isotherms Fig. 1 a shows the adsorption-desorption isotherms of Ni5LaSnT catalysts. All of them showed IV-Type isotherms with A-type hysteresis loops indicating the presence of non-porous particles and interparticle porosity due to pore space located between grains. Comparing isotherms of the different catalysts shows that the calcined at 700°C presents larger area (greater volume adsorbed in filling the monolayer). No significant differences are observed between the catalysts calcined at higher temperatures (850, 900 and 950° C). For catalysts calcined at 850°C–950°C, the hysteresis loops have moved to higher relative pressures respect to the calcined at 700°C, indicating the presence of mesopores with a larger size accompanying the loss of specific surface area. Pore size distribution of all Ni5LaSn catalysts is shown in Fig. 1b. The shift of the maximum towards larger pore diameters along with the increase of the calcination temperature is consistent with that observed in Fig. 1a. Textural properties of all fresh catalysts are shown in Table 1 . A marked decrease of specific surface area from 62 to 21m2 g−1 takes place with the increase of the calcinations temperature from 700°C to 950°C while the average pore diameter is increased from 12 to 22nm as evidenced in the adsorption-desorption isotherms. The increase in the Ni amount from 5% to 15% led to the decrease of the surface specific area from 62 to 53m2 g−1 for the catalyst calcined at 700°C and from 21 to 16m2 g−1 for the catalyst calcined at 950°C as a consequence of a greater coating of pore spaces with NiO. 2.1.2 XRD analysis Fig. 2 shows XRD patterns of Ni5LaSnT solids. Starting from a solid with a poor crystallinity obtained at 700°C, the increase of the final calcination temperature leads to a well-defined biphasic system containing monoclinic NiO phase (2θ=32.20°, 43.46°, 63.12°) and a La2Sn2O7 cubic pyrochlore phase (2θ=28.98°, 33.46°, 48.24°, 57.12°, 59.98°). No signals of SnO2 and La2O3 can be observed in the well crystallized solids obtained at 900°C and 950°C, thus indicating that total integration of Sn and La in the pyrochlore structure could be achieved by this preparation technique. Due to the characteristics of the process the NiO phase thus obtained would be in close contact with the pyrochlore thus favoring its dispersion and strong interaction between both phases. This behavior is quite similar to that of the Ni-La-Zr system already studied in previous works [24–26]. The same peaks were obtained in XRD patterns of catalysts containing 15% Ni although those corresponding to NiO have a higher relative intensity. Relative phase composition (in weight) was determined with the Rietveld equation as shown in Table 2 . The amount of the NiO phase is close to the corresponding theoretical content of Ni, thus confirming the absence of significant amounts of the metal as substituent in the pyrochlore phase. Structural stability of the catalysts under reducing conditions was also characterized by XRD. Fig. 3 a shows the XRD patterns of Ni5LaSn700 and Ni15LaSn700 after one hour reduction at 650°C with pure H2 prior to the ESR tests. The Ni5LaSn700 catalyst showed well defined peaks (2θ=30.54°, 31.92°, 43.86°, 44.90°) corresponding to Sn(0). It is well know that reduction from Sn4+ and Sn2+ to Sn(0) takes place in reducing atmospheres and temperatures between 420–600°C [36] similar to the used in the catalytic reforming test and is promoted by the H2 spillover effect induced by metallic Ni [33]. Metallic Ni is not observed, but it was probably formed and completely covered by Sn(0). In this sense, Bobadilla et al. has recently reported XPS results of a reduced Ni-Sn/CeMgAl catalyst showing the formation of Ni-Sn bimetallic particles with a central core of metallic Ni surrounded by an outer layer rich in Sn(0) [37]. Reduced Ni15LaSn700 shows peaks corresponding to a mixture of intermetallic compounds NixSny which together can be considered as a single NiSn alloy with stoichiometry of 1:1 (2θ=39.32°, 41.98°, 44.85°). Different stoichiometries are reported for the NiSn compounds: Ni3Sn4, NiSn, Ni3Sn2 and Ni3Sn [38]. Ni:Sn atomic ratio of this catalyst is approximately 1:1, so all the Ni and Sn become part of this intermetallic compound from the start of the reaction. The presence of La(OH)3 also reveals that an incipient association of the La and the Sn to form a pyrochlore structure is also affected by Sn reduction, leaving La under a more stable hydroxide compound. XRD patterns of the reduced NixLaSn950 catalysts are shown in Fig. 3b. The presence of the La2Sn2O7 pyrochlore after 1hour of reduction time is observed in both catalysts thus showing that Sn4+ cannot be reduced as easily as in the poorly crystallized NixLaSn700 catalysts. High chemical stability of this pyrochlore compound was reported in a reducing atmosphere up to 700°C [33]. Signals corresponding to a NiSn alloy with Ni3Sn stoichiometry are clearly observed in Ni15LaSn950 reduced 1hour (2θ=39.32°, 41.98°, 44.9°). These signals are almost not detected in Ni5LaSn950, presumably as result of the smaller amount of Ni in this catalyst. All these results show that some of the Sn4+ could be reduced mainly that located at the boundary with Ni crystallites which could favor H2 spillover effects. Fig. 3b also shows the Ni15LaSn950 crystalline structure at higher reduction times. Pyrochlore signals are clearly observed after 24hours thus confirming its high chemical stability under reducing conditions like those used in these studies. The composition of the NiSn compound is also affected by changing from the initial Ni:Sn ratio 3:1 to a final value 2.7:2 close to that of the Ni3Sn2 compound (2θ=30.82°, 34.88°, 43.64°, 44.64°, 55.12°, 57.88°, 64.18°). Signals corresponding to the La(OH)3 also appeared, thus demonstrating that partial collapse of the pyrochlore can take place under these experimental conditions. Rietveld analysis (Table 3 ) shows that at 12hours the Ni3Sn2 phase was 38% by weight with a crystallite size of 20.1nm and at 24hours 42% by weight with crystallite size of 39.9nm."
7,Ethanol steam reforming tests,"2.2 Ethanol steam reforming tests Table 4 shows the main results of the ESR tests conducted at 500°C and 650°C. Significant ethanol conversion was achieved with Ni5LaSnT catalysts at 500°C (92.3% and 98.1% for Ni5LaSn700 and Ni5LaSn950 respectively) whereas it was higher than 99% at 650°C for both catalysts. Significant increase of H2 yields took place with the increase of temperature, attaining values of 2.62 and 1.73 at 650°C which correspond to 43% and 28% of the maximum stoichiometric amount (YH2,Max =6) according to equation (1). Acetaldehyde (AcH) and acetone (Acet) were found in high amounts in the tests at 500°C mainly for Ni5LaSn700. These results show that ethanol dehydrogenation to form acetaldehyde takes place in a first step and that acetone is formed in subsequent steps involving several reaction paths such as aldol condensation of acetaldehyde, acetic acid formation (CH3CHO+H2O→CH3CO2H+H2), the ketonization reaction (2CH3COOH → (CH3)2CO+H2O+CO2) and/or decarboxylation of aldol condensation products, all these reactions being favoured by the basic sites of the catalysts [18,39,40]. Low CH4 and CO selectivity at 500°C reveals the poor activity of these materials to catalyze C-C bonds cleavage of acetaldehyde thus favouring competitive reactions leading to acetone and CO2 formation. At 650°C, the high CH4 selectivity, mainly over Ni5LaSn950 (10.5%), also reveals the poor activity in catalyzing CH4 reforming, in agreement with results reported by Wang et al. for CH4 steam reforming over Ni supported on La2Sn2O7 pyrochlore [33]. C2 and C3 products (mainly ethylene, ethane, propylene and propane) appeared in varying amounts and their formation is ascribed to several side reactions taking place in the presence of acid/base and redox sites. Ethanol undergoes intramolecular dehydration to yield ethylene mainly over acidic sites, although catalysis by basic sites can also take place. Redox sites could allow partial ethylene hydrogenation to yield ethane [41,42]. Propylene is suggested to be obtained by the following reaction pathways: ethanol → acetaldehyde → acetone → propylene in the presence of basic sites [43]. Acid-base sites in these catalysts can be provided by the Sn-La mixed oxide. SnO2 is known as an amphoteric oxide with a slightly acid character which can shift the isoelectric point to lower pH values with regard to that of the more basic rare earth oxide [44]. For Ni15LaSn700, H2 yield and products selectivity were close to those found with Ni5LaSn700 in the tests performed at both reaction temperatures, with only a lower selectivity of acetaldehyde in the test at 500°C. A marked increase of catalytic activity along with the increase of Ni loading would be expected according to previous results with other Ni containing catalysts used in alcohols steam reforming reactions [26]. The scarce influence of Ni loading here observed may be related to the large quantity of Sn(0) formed after the reduction treatment of these catalysts having low crystallinity. It is known that for NiSn systems the catalytic activity has been shown to decrease significantly along with the increase of the amount of Sn in the alloy [37,38]. Because of this, Sn contribution to catalytic activity must be predominant under these conditions despite the different nickel loadings in both catalysts. On the contrary, several marked differences were observed for Ni15LaSn950. On one hand, CH4 and CO selectivities were significantly higher compared with Ni5LaSn950 at 500°C, thus highlighting the increased active sites capacity for C-C and C-H bonds cleavage. The low acetaldehyde selectivity at both reaction temperatures points in the same direction. On the other hand, H2 yields doubled over that of Ni5LaSn950 at both reaction temperatures, thus confirming the marked influence of Ni loading on the catalytic performance. When compared with the catalyst containing the same Ni loading and calcined at 700°C (Ni15LaSn700), Ni15LaSn950 has a lower specific surface area, so that its higher activity must be ascribed to changes of active sites properties after calcination at 950°C. As shown by XRD analysis Ni-rich intermetallic compounds (Ni3Sn and Ni3Sn2) were formed in this catalyst and they could be responsible of the improved performance. In order to quantify Ni contribution to the catalytic activity, LaSnT mixed oxide were tested in the ESR reactions. These oxides showed to be active but in a minor degree than the Ni5LaSnT and Ni15LaSnT catalysts. At 650°C, ethanol conversions of 90% and 87% and H2 yields of 1.63 and 1.02 were observed for LaSn700 and LaSn950, respectively. The activity of rare earth doped SnO2 in the ESR process has already been reported with H2, ethylene, and acetaldehyde as the main products [44]. H2 yields as function of time are shown for all catalysts in Figs. 4 a and 4b. No significant variation was observed over the Ni5LaSnT catalysts in the first 8hours of operation at 650°C. Non-reacted ethanol and condensable intermediates (AcH and Acet) analyzed in the 2 cold traps (corresponding to the first and second half of the test) were also found in similar amounts. All these results reveal that the catalytic activity remains stable for the main products in the first 8hours of operation. At 500°C both catalysts showed similar initial H2 yields (around 1.4) but it remained stable only for Ni5LaSn700. The constant decrease observed for Ni5LaSn950 reveals the occurrence of deactivation processes due to the poisoning of active sites by carbon formation and/or to changes in their chemical properties. Carbon monoxide was not detected in any of the reforming tests performed at 500°C which reveals that C-C bond cleavage would not occur in a high extent under these reaction conditions and that H2 is produced mainly by the ethanol dehydrogenation step to yield acetaldehyde. For the Ni5LaSn950 catalyst the increase of ethylene yields from 0.04 to 0.07 in the first and second half of the test respectively at 650°C and from 0.01 to 0.02 at 500°C shows changes in the properties during the ESR test. Fajardo et al. reported the activity of the SnO2 undoped and doped with rare earths (Y and Ce) for the ethanol steam reforming at similar temperature. Their results showed that increasing the calcination temperature in the Ce-doped SnO2 leads to an increase in ethylene selectivity and a decrease in acetaldehyde selectivity, due a lower interaction between the SnO2 and the dopant which leads to a less basic surface [44]. This increase in ethylene selectivity shows that the same behavior can take place in this catalyst with La instead of Ce due a loss of interaction between Sn and La during the reaction. LaSn950 catalyst showed the same tendency with an increase of the selectivity from 0.20 to 0.34 in the first and second half of the assay respectively. Ni15LaSnT catalysts also showed no significant changes during the 8hours tests at 650°C, thus showing that typical deactivation phenomena are not taking place in a high extent. It is known that Ni resistance to carbon formation is improved by elements with similar structure to C or belonging to the groups 14 and 15 of the periodic table (such as the Sn) [34,35]. The alloyed Sn disrupts the connectivity of the Ni atoms thus affecting C atoms diffusion over the surface of Ni particles leading to carbon nucleation [45]. In addition, carbon gasification could be favored due to the combined action of several gasifying agents: water, CO2 and lattice oxygen. Basic properties of La(OH)3 favors water and CO2 chemisorption and thereby their reaction with carbon. Oxygen vacancies in the La2Sn2O7 could enhance the migration of bulk lattice oxygen to the boundary of NiSn crystallites where carbon is formed [30]. Fig. 4b also shows the results of H2 production with the Ni15LaSn700 and Ni15LaSn950 catalysts in ESR at 500°C. They exhibit the same differences already observed with catalysts with 5% of Ni. That is to say that the catalyst with low crystallinity (Ni15LaSn700) gives a constant production close to that obtained with the lower Ni amount, whereas the catalyst displaying well defined Ni3Sn and pyrochlore phases undergoes significant deactivation. Probably, at this reaction temperature, carbon deposited on the NiSn active sites cannot be efficiently removed by the several gasification agents involved in the whole mechanism. Similar to Ni5LaSn950 and LaSn950, for Ni15LaSn950 a loss in the basic properties of the surface is evidenced by a slight increase in ethylene yield in the second half of the test at both temperatures. The evolution of the main gaseous products in the ESR reaction was followed with the Ni15LaSn950 catalyst at 650°C for 80hours. Fig. 5 shows that initial yields kept constant during the first 12hours. Then, a decay is observed until a new stable production rate is attained until the end of the test. These results suggest that this catalyst can have a highly stable performance for the production of H2-rich gaseous mixtures starting from ethanol and that it can be related with a stable catalyst structure as well as a low influence of deactivation phenomena."
8,Post-reaction characterization,"2.3 Post-reaction characterization 2.3.1 XRD analysis of the Ni15LaSn950 catalyst Fig. 6 shows that the La2Sn2O7 signals were not significantly affected after the 80hours ESR test at 650°C, thus confirming the high stability of this compound under the ESR experimental conditions here used. The Ni3Sn compound which is present at 8hours is partially transformed in Ni3Sn2 appearing at the end of the test. These results suggest that Ni3Sn sites could be responsible of the higher initial activity observed in Fig. 5, whereas Ni3Sn2 sites could be related with the lower and constant activity during the rest of the test. According to Scherrer equation there is not significant variation in the average crystallite size for the La2Sn2O7 pyrochlore after 8 and 80h of reaction, indicating thermal stability with high sintering resistance of this support. The broad peak near 26° can be assigned to small particles of carbonaceous residues, possibly lanthanum carbonates formed on the pyrochlore during the ESR reaction. 2.3.2 Thermogravimetric analysis and carbon quantification Fig. 7 a shows thermograms of catalysts calcined at 700°C (Ni15LaSn700 and LaSn700) after the 8hours ESR tests. A weight increase starting at 250°C is attributed to reoxidation of the Ni(0) and Sn(0) intermetallic compounds and a marked weight loss at 480°C is attributed to the combustion and/or decomposition of carbonaceous residues formed on the catalyst surface during the test [46]. The weight losses observed for Ni15LaSn700 are equivalent to 11 and 16mgg−1 which are of the same order of that of the non Ni-containing catalyst. Elemental carbon results provided in Table 5 are of same order (5.2 and 25.3 for the used at 500°C and 650°C respectively). Partial overlapping between reoxidation and combustion stages in the thermograms as well as the presence of other elements (H and O) in the carbon residues makes difficult a more quantitative comparison of results obtained by both techniques. Thermograms for Ni15LaSn950 and LaSn950 are shown in Fig. 7b. The weight increase corresponding to Ni(0) and Sn(0) reoxidation is lower than that observed with the poorly crystallized catalysts. It may be ascribed, at less partially, to a lower amount of reduced tin in the spent catalyst due to the high stability of Sn4+ in the pyrochlore. The weight losses associated to combustion (62 and 74mgg−1) were larger than that of Ni15LaSn700, which indicates the greater tendency of the Ni15LaSn950 catalysts to form carbonaceous residues. This may be attributed to several factors: i) the presence of the Ni-rich phase having higher catalytic activity than the Sn-rich compounds formed in Ni15LaSn700. Because of that, the rate of reaction paths leading to carbon formation could also be increased; ii) less specific area of the catalyst would reduce the amount of active sites available to H2O and CO2 adsorption. In this way, the rate of carbon gasification would be thus reduced; iii) larger NiSn crystallite size with less contact area with the other metal oxides could also be formed and favour carbon formation. In agreement with TGA results, higher amounts of elemental carbon (103.7 and 62.6mgg−1) were found over this catalyst as shown in Table 5. The larger amount of elemental carbon formed on Ni15LaSn950 can explain its deactivation during the reforming test at 500°C. Ni5LaSn950 also showed deactivation in the reforming test at the same temperature although the amount of elemental carbon was quite lower (16.2mgg−1), which indicates that other deactivation phenomena can be involved. Probably, due to the lower Ni amount, partial coating by reduced tin could occur thus contributing to the rate decrease of H2 production. Covering of Ni active sites by Sn species can also prevent adsorption of reactant molecules as it was proposed by Bobadilla et al. in glycerol steam reforming on Sn-modified Ni catalysts [37]. 2.3.3 Raman spectroscopy In order to study the nature of the surface carbonaceous residues, Raman spectroscopy was made to fresh and spent catalysts. Fig. 8 a shows Raman spectra for the Ni15LaSn700 catalysts. The spectra showed clear bands at 130, 562, 786, 1099 and 2425cm−1 which can be associated to surface carbonates of La(OH)3. Under reaction conditions La species in the Ni15LaSn700 catalysts can react with CO2 to form La2O2CO3 [47], as they are not integrated in the La2Sn2O7 pyrochlore structure. Lanthanum oxy-carbonate, La2O2CO3, is a stable intermediate in the thermal decomposition of La2(CO3)3 to La2O3 and CO2 and is of considerable interest because of its activity to react with surface carbon, thus cleaning the Ni surface of carbon deposits and increasing its stability [48]: (2) La2O2CO3 +C→La2O3 +2CO The higher intensity of carbonates bands in the used catalysts indicates that these were mainly formed during the tests and their broadness suggest that this phase is of nanometric dimensions. Fig. 8b shows the Raman spectra for the Ni15LaSn950 catalysts. The intensity of carbonate bands decreased significantly for the catalyst used at 500°C with respect to the Ni15LaSn700 catalysts and they were absent for the catalyst used at 650°C at the first 8hours of reaction. This can be explained by a higher thermodynamic stability of La integrated to the pyrochlore phase, which reduces their availability to react with CO2 and form carbonates. The decomposition of La2O2CO3 to CO2 and La2O3 takes place at temperatures slightly above 700°C but the exact temperature depends of the experimental conditions and gas composition [49], so the high temperature of the test, the low availability of free La and an increase rate of gasification of carbonaceous residues explain the slow rate of carbonates formation in the Ni15LaSn950 catalysts used at 650°C. Fig. 8b also shows bands for the Ni15LaSn950 catalyst not used in the ESR test at 295, 340, 392 and 500cm−1 commonly associated to the pyrochlore phase [28]. Relative intensity of the pyrochlore bands drastically decrease in the used catalysts, which is ascribed to the fluorescence masking of Raman spectra. Fig. 8b-inset shows the pyrochlore typical peaks after background correction, thus evidencing its presence in the used catalysts. These bands are also present in the fresh Ni15LaSn700 catalyst (Fig. 8a), showing an incipient formation of the pyrochlore phase despite the poor crystallinity of this solid. Typical carbon peaks G and D (at 1600 and 1350cm−1 respectively) appears for the Ni15LaSn950 catalysts used at 650°C, 80hours. Their absence in the catalysts used for 8hours may be associated to a highly disordered carbon structure due the relative low time of the test [50]. 2.3.4 TEM microscopy Catalysts morphology and carbon formation were studied by TEM microscopy. The fresh and unreduced Ni15LaSn950 catalyst is characterized by nanoparticle aggregates of uniform size (30–70nm) (Fig. 9 a and 9b). A high concentration of amorphous carbon deposits are clearly observed after 8hours of reaction time at 500°C (Fig. 9c and 9d). This is in line with the rapid deactivation which was observed during this test (Fig. 4b), as well as with the TGA (Fig. 7b) and elemental analysis results (Table 5) indicating severe coking taking place during this ESR test. Catalyst morphology shows no notable changes after the 8hours. According to these results, no significant sintering effects took place for this catalyst in the reforming at 500°C."
9,Conclusions,"Ni-La-Sn mixed oxides prepared by precipitation with KOH showed catalytic activity in the ethanol steam reforming reaction over the temperatures range of 500–650°C. Calcination temperatures over 850°C lead to a well-defined biphasic structure containing NiO and the La2Sn2O7 pyrochlore like structure. For catalysts calcined at 700°C, both Ni2+ and Sn+4 in the solid are easily reduced in the presence of pure H2 at 650°C. A Sn-rich intermetallic compound with poor catalytic activity and little influence of the Ni amount is formed. For catalysts obtained at 950°C, a highly stable structure containing NiSn compounds and the La2Sn2O7 pyrochlore is attained under steam reforming conditions with high activity and selectivity for the production of H2-rich gaseous mixtures. Low deactivation of this catalyst was observed at 650°C thus showing highly efficient carbon removal from the boundaries of active sites."
