0,Introduction,"Extensive use of fossil fuels results in global warming due to the carbon dioxide emissions. As a result, finding CO2 neutral alternative energy sources have become a pressing need in most nations’ agenda due to the recent global climate changes [1]. Hydrogen is an environmentally friendly clean energy alternative since its combustion by-product is only water. A wide variety of alternative methods are available for the production of hydrogen; among them biological ones are much less energy intensive and ecologically acceptable since most organic waste materials can also be used for the purpose of hydrogen production. Among the various bio-hydrogen production methods (direct biophotolysis, indirect biophotolysis, photo-fermentation), anaerobic dark fermentation of carbohydrate-rich wastes seems to be a promising alternative. Pure cultures known to produce hydrogen from carbohydrates include species of Enterobacter [2], Bacillus [3] and Clostridium [4]. Mixed cultures enriched from natural environments are reported to contain mostly Clostridia [4,5]. Heat-treated biological materials (sewage sludge, compost material, soil etc.) are frequently used for inoculation purposes in bio-hydrogen production studies as a ready source of hydrogen-producing mixed microflora [4,6]. There have been many studies regarding the use of anaerobic fermentation for the purpose of hydrogen production; the substrates employed for this purpose were usually synthetic media (simple sugar, starch etc.) that were not feasible for use due to their high cost. Wastewater containing high concentrations of carbohydrates can be preferred for economic reasons. A variety of alternative organic substrates including bean curd manufacturing waste, rice and wheat wastewater, molasses and sugary wastewater, waste activated sludge, municipal solid waste, starch wastewater, cafeteria food waste, peptone degradation, lignocellulose materials such as rice straw, coir and sugarcane bagasse, paper sludge and cheese whey have been used for hydrogen production [7,8]. Currently, a very limited number of papers on the use of cheese whey for bio-hydrogen production may be found in the literature [8–10]. None of these studies reported continuous hydrogen production from cheese whey wastewater using mixed culture at thermophilic range. Cheese whey is the lactose-rich watery by-product of cheese manufacturing. It makes up about 80% of the original fermentation medium and it retains most of the milk fat, trace minerals, salts and vitamins. Cheese whey contains about 5% lactose, which is quite adequate to be used for hydrogen production [8]. It is a subject of environmental concern due to its high organic content, which is generally discharged into public sewerage lines or receiving media in Turkey. It is estimated that 137.9million tonnes of cheese whey was produced worldwide in 1998 [11]. The objective of this study was to investigate continuous anaerobic fermentation processes for H2 production from cheese whey, under thermophilic conditions. Even though a number of other technological developments in the transformation of whey to other useful products are available, utilization of cheese whey wastewater in order to produce bio-hydrogen is important from both the economical and environmental standpoint."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Seed sludge,"2.1 Seed sludge Anaerobic seed sludge was obtained from an anaerobic digester located in Izmir, Turkey. The sludge was stored at 4°C until use. Prior to use, the seed sludge was heated at 85°C for 45min to eliminate the activity of methanogenic bacteria and to enrich the hydrogen-producing bacteria. Initial concentration of total suspended solids (TSS) of the stock biomass was determined to be 167g/l. The bioreactor was initially inoculated at a ratio of 10% (by volume) using this stock seed sludge."
3,Feed and medium composition,"2.2 Feed and medium composition Fresh raw cheese whey was obtained on a weekly basis from a large dairy facility in Izmir, Turkey. It had a pH of 4.7, chemical oxygen demand (COD): 86.3g/l, total sugars (as lactose): 42.6g/l, suspended solids: 6.9g/l, and total nitrogen: 0.2g/l. It was kept at 4°C until used. It is known that bacteriocins excreted from lactic acid bacteria (e.g. Lactobacillus paracasei) may inhibit hydrogen production [12]. Therefore, before use, fresh raw cheese whey was subjected to heat treatment at 105°C for 5min to eliminate lactic acid bacteria. The COD of feed material was diluted with distilled water in accordance with the required organic loading rate (OLR) in the bioreactor and the following nutrients were added as supplements to provide essential trace elements and nutrient for H2 producing consortia in bioreactors, respectively: 1.25g/l NaHCO3; 2.5g/l NH4Cl; 0.25g/l KH2PO4; 0.25g/l CaCl2, 0.032g/l NiSO4; 0.32g/l MgSO4 ·7H2O; 0.02g/l FeCl2; 0.0144g/l Na2MoO4 ·2H2O; 0.023g/l ZnCl2; 0.021g/l CoCl2 ·6H2O; 0.01g/l CuCl2 ·6H2O; 0.03g/l MnCl2 ·4H2O; 0.05g/l yeast extract; and 0.5g/l cysteine."
4,Experimental setup and operation,"2.3 Experimental setup and operation Hydrogen production experiments were carried out in a fermentor of 3l capacity with a working volume of 2l (BIOSTAT-A, Sartorius, Germany). The fermentor was continuously fed and decanted by the help of peristaltic pumps (ISMATEC) with respect to variation of OLR and HRT. Two different organic loading strategies were employed: (i) constant COD and varying HRT and (ii) varying COD and constant HRT. The bioreactor was covered with aluminum foil to avoid sunlight and was stirred at a constant rate of 200rpm. The pH of mixed liquid in the reactors was controlled at pH 5.5±0.05 with 2M KOH. The volume of total biogas released from headspace of reactors was measured continuously by a wet type gas meter and composition of biogas (H2 content) was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) daily. After inoculation (10% of reactor volume, initial SS: 1.7g/l), feed material (having different initial COD values depending on the required OLR) was added to the reactors. The reactors were flushed with pure nitrogen gas for 10min to attain an anaerobic environment before the startup of reactors. The reactors was initially operated for 2days in batch mode, without additional feed supply in order to avoid washout of inactivated biomass, and then converted to continuous operation when a considerable total gas production was monitored."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Samples were centrifuged at 10,000rpm for 10min before they were analyzed. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) and suspended solids were measured according to the standard methods [13]. Total nitrogen was measured with MERK 14 555 (N, 10–150mg/l) test kits. Total sugar concentration was estimated as lactose by the phenol sulfuric acid method. Volatile fatty acids (acetate, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, isovalate, valate, isocaprionate, caprionate and heptanoic acid) and alcohols (ethanol, acetone and butanol) in the mixed liquor were analyzed using a GC (6890N Agilent) equipped with a flame ionization detector and DB-FFAP 30 m×0,32mm×0,25mm capillary column (J&W Scientific) The initial temperature of the column was 40°C for 3min followed with a ramp of 20°C/min to 60°C for 3min and then increased at 30°C/min to 120°C for 4min and reach a final temperature with ramp of 30°C/min to 240°C for 6min. The temperatures of the injector and detector were both 240°C. Helium was used as the carrier gas at constant pressure of 103kPa. Lactate, oxalate, tartrate, malic acid, maleic acid, citric acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid and formate were identified and quantified by HPLC (Shimadzu) equipped with UV-Vis (SPD10A) detector (210nm) using 150mm×4.6mm Prevail Organic Acid 5U (GRACE) column. 0.025M KH2PO4 (pH=2.5) was used in mobile phase at a flow rate 0.8ml/min. Mixed liquor sample of 1.5ml was first acidified with phosphoric acid and then filtered through a 0.2μm membrane before being analyzed. The H2 content in the headspace was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) (6890N Agilent) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and Hayesep D 80/100 packed column. Injector, detector and column temperatures were kept at 120°C, 140°C, and 35°C, respectively. Argon was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 20ml/min."
6,Characterization of microbial community,"2.5 Characterization of microbial community The microbial population in each reactor was determined by PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene, cloning into a linear vector and subsequent DNA sequencing. Samples were taken from the reactor and filtered to remove the suspended, large particulate materials. After that, it was centrifuged at 5000× g for 1min to concentrate the cells in the form of a pellet. The pellet was resuspended in 100μl of water and 1μl of it was used as template for PCR. All PCR amplifications were done in a total volume of 20μl. Eubacterial universal primers 8F (5′-AGA GTT TGA TCM TGG CTG AG-3′) and 518R (5′-ATT ACC GCG GCT GCT GG-3′) were used for PCR amplification. Thermal profile for PCR reaction was as follows: a single denaturation step of 5min at 95°C, a 3-step amplification program set for 30 cycles with denaturation for 30s at 95°C, annealing for 30s at 60°C and extension for 1min at 72°C with a final extension step of 72°C for 5min. Each experiment was performed with positive and negative controls. The PCR-amplified product that was about 510bp, was cloned to pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's recommendations. The insert was again PCR amplified by using vector primers M13F (5′-CAG GAA ACA GCT ATG AC-3′) and M13R (5′-GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG-3′) and was subjected to DNA sequencing. DNA sequencing data was analyzed by nBlast available on NCBI website. Real-time PCR (Roche Light cycler480) was done using the same eubacterial primers 8F and 518R as were used for conventional PCR. DNA extraction was done for all real-time PCR reactions by using ZRsoil microbe DNA extraction kit (Zymo Research). Thermal profile for real-time PCR was: denaturation at 95°C for 2min followed by 3-step amplification for 40 cycles. Melting at 95°C for 10s, annealing at 60°C for 10s and elongation at 72°C for 20s, followed by a melt curve analysis until 95°C with continuous acquisition."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Effect of substrate concentration on hydrogen production,"3.1 Effect of substrate concentration on hydrogen production Two different operational strategies were employed as mentioned above. In the first part of the experimental studies, fermentative H2 production was carried out using a range of organic loading rates (OLRs) of 21, 35 and 45g COD/l/day in a 2l continuous CSTR reactor at 55°C. HRT was kept constant at HRT 1day. The bioreactor was started up in batch mode, when hydrogen production reached its peak value, the bioreactor feeding mode was turned to a continuous one. The fermentor was operated for 161days with decreasing OLR (Fig. 1 ). During the first period of the experiments (lasting for 48days) in which OLR was kept at 47g COD/l/day, the total gas (both H2 and CO2) production rate varied from 0.1 to 13.2l/day (the lowest values are due to no feed conditions on weekends) and the volumetric H2 content of total biogas varied between 2.9% and 66.4% (v/v). Methane in the headspace was observed from time to time (1.6–41.2%), especially when pH in the bioreactor rose to neutral range. As the pH was reduced down to 5.5, methane in the headspace faded out. It was speculated that although the methanogenic bacteria was assumed to be washed out from the bioreactor under short hydraulic retention time, methanogenic bacteria on the walls of the bioreactor might have been able to stay active resulting in methane production [9]. Hydrogen production rate followed a fluctuating pattern between 0 and 3l H2/l/day with an average value of 1.5l H2/l/day. Similarly, COD removal efficiency also showed a fluctuating pattern, which was 45% on average. Mohan et al. [15] recently reported that increasing OLR lead to decreasing H2 production rate on bio-H2 production from dairy wastewater in AnSBR, which is parallel to our results presented here. Biomass concentration reached 11.7g/l on day 45. Volatile organic acid (VFA) and alcohol production was determined with GC. Alcohol production was observed to be insignificant except for ethanol, which was observed from time to time at concentrations between 106.2 and 1104mg/l. The HPLC and GC analysis indicated that main VFAs were acetic acid (76.5–1625mg/l), propionic acid (0–2125mg/l), isobutyric acid (0–910mg/l), butyric acid (0–1558mg/l) isocaprionic acid (10–789mg/l), formate (0–3009mg/l) and lactate (0–13583mg/l). From day 48, the OLR was decreased to 35g COD/l/day. In this period, which lasted 41days, the total biogas production continued its fluctuating pattern between 0.4 and 12.4l/day, but the hydrogen content of the headspace slightly increased in this period (37.5% and 82.5%). Methane production was not observed during this period. Hydrogen production rate decreased with reducing OLR and varied from 0.2 to 2.9l H2/l/day. COD removal efficiency also reduced to 27% on average. Ethanol production was determined on days 56 (1008mg/l), 59 (194mg/l) and 68 (290mg/l). Lactate production was increased and showed a fluctuating pattern between 232 and 17,476mg/l). Finally OLR was reduced to 21g COD/l/day for the last part of the study. The bioreactor was operated for 60days. As expected the total biogas production (including H2 and CO2) decreased (0.4–8.1l/day) but hydrogen of the headspace stabilized around 60%. Methane production was detected on days 145 and 152. This result indicated presence of methanogens. During this period, acetone was detected that ranged between 11 and 381mg/l from time to time. The most abundant VFAs in reactor effluent were lactate and acetic acid. The most abundant VFA in all tested OLRs was lactate. Lactose was converted to lactic acid by mixed culture rather than acetic acid formation. Although Yang et al. [9] reported that they did not detect lactate in their reactor effluents at OLR 5, 10, 12 and 14g COD/l/d under mesophilic conditions, we determined lactate formation in all tested OLRs (Table 1 ). Lactate is a key intermediate of lactose fermentation. The second most abundant VFA was formate which is a hydrogen donor. Propionic acid formation was observed from time to time. Degradation of one mole carbohydrate (glucose) into acetate should yield formation of four moles hydrogen, if no ethanol is produced. Thus lactose fermentation could be written as follows; (1) C 1 2 H 2 2 O 1 1 + 5 H 2 O → 8 H 2 + 4 CO 2 + 4 CH 3 COOH Based on the above equation, the theoretical yield of hydrogen on lactose should be 8mol per mole of lactose, which is better than glucose. However, the highest yields found in the literature were 2.7, 3.0 and 3.7mol hydrogen per mole lactose, respectively [8,14,16]. The average hydrogen yield was found to be 2mol H2 per mole of lactose in this study. In the literature, it was reported that increasing OLR leads to decreasing H2 yield [17]."
9,Effect of HRT on hydrogen production,"3.2 Effect of HRT on hydrogen production In the second part of the study, the effect of HRT on hydrogen production was investigated by keeping the influent COD concentration constant (47g COD/l) but varying the HRT between 1 and 3.5days (Fig. 2 ). The fermentor was operated for 274days with decreasing HRT from 3.5days to 1day at the end of the study. Once again, the fluctuating pattern for all parameters continued for this part of the study. The reactor was started up in batch mode and when the biogas production peaked, the reactor was fed continuously. The initial HRT was set at 3.5days to accelerate the acclimation process of the seed sludge. The total biogas production at HRT 3.5 varied between 0.1 and 9.9l/day (the lowest values are due to no feed conditions on weekends) and H2 content was between 4.5% and 81.7% (v/v). No methane except for one condition on day 110 was detected throughout the study. Hydrogen production rate varied between 0 and 6l H2/l/day with an average value of 1.5l H2/l/day. COD removal efficiency was between 10% and 90% during this period. Hydrogen production rate significantly decreased when HRT was reduced to 2days with the exception of a few cases where it peaked (days 100 and 175). H2 production rate was between the values 0 and 0.5l H2/l/day. But the hydrogen content of the headspace did not change that much. Total biogas production also decreased. COD conversion rates of both HRTs fluctuated between 10% and 80%. The HRT was reduced to 1day. The biogas production showed fluctuation between 0.1 and 9.0l/day. Hydrogen content of headspace of bioreactor was between 10.9% and 100%. Methane production was not determined. Hydrogen production yield and production rate during the period were 4.7mmol H2/g COD, 1.0l H2/l/day on average. The COD removal efficiency fluctuated between 7% and 47%. Hydrogen yield decreased with reduced HRT. Acetic acid, propionic acid, lactate and formic acid were the main organic acids in all tested HRTs (Table 1). Acetic acid concentration in reaction mixture of HRT 3.5, 2, 1 was 518.9mg/l, 482.9mg/l and 1239.1mg/l respectively. Although butyrate concentration at HRT 2 and 1 was decreased, isobutyrate concentration was increased. Alcohol production was determined for all tested HRTs. Acetone and ethanol were the main products of all tested HRTs; butanol production was detected only at HRT 2. Propionate, considered a hydrogen consumer, was increased from 78.8mg/l to 467.4mg/l with decreasing HRT. Lactate and formate were dominant organic acids in the reaction mixture. Lactate concentration was determined for HRT 3.5: 1650mg/l, HRT 2: 2578.1mg/l and HRT 1 6389.3mg/l respectively. It was reported that low H2 yields are associated with production of reduced metabolites such as alcohols and lactate [18]."
10,Microbial diversity,"3.3 Microbial diversity The samples withdrawn from the bioreactor were used for PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene after filtration and centrifugation to remove particulate matter. PCR amplified fragments were cloned in pCRII-TOPO vector, positive clones were selected on the basis of their resistance to ampicillin and then confirmed by a second round of PCR amplifications using vector specific primers (Fig. 3 ). Samples were obtained for the analysis of microbial community representing HRT 2 and 3.5days. The number of clones selected for HRT 2 that were found positive was 11. For HRT 3.5, clones were selected in two rounds, 2 in the first round (HRT 3.5 I) when the reactor was working well and 12 in the second round (HRT 3.5 II) when efficiency of the reactor was reduced with respect to hydrogen production (Fig. 4 ). HRT 3.5 I clone numbers 4, 7 and HRT 3.5 II clones 2, 10, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 were analyzed by DNA sequencing. Sequencing data were analyzed by using the nucleotide Blast tool. All the clones from HRT 3.5 (I) and HRT 3.5 (II) showed maximum similarity to Thermoanaerobacteriaceae bacterium clone THPB-7 accession no. AM408569.1. Members of thermoanaerobacteriaceae have been widely reported for continuous hydrogen production [19–22]. The presence of the same type of bacterial population in the reactor during good and bad working conditions with respect to hydrogen production indicates that the hydrogen producing population was viable throughout the culture period but could have been under stress due to other changing physicochemical parameters. All the clones sequenced showed maximum similarity to Thermoanaerobacteriaceae bacterium with 99% identity. Real-time PCR was used for the evaluation of its possible use in continuous observation of the population dynamics, using the sequenced clones as standards. The real-time PCR analysis showed the shear identity of all the clones, as is evident from their very close Tm values. Monthly reactor samples were also analyzed using this technique and were found to be identical (data not shown). Real-time PCR results showed the presence and viability of the same population over a longer period of time. The use of this bacterium for biohydrogen production from palm oil mill effluent was previously reported [23]."
11,Conclusions,"Cheese whey wastewater, which is rich in lactose, is an amenable substrate for hydrogen production. The experimental results demonstrated that HRT had an impact on hydrogen production rate. It can be concluded that lower HRT values (e.g. 1day) increased hydrogen production rate. The hydrogen percentage in the headspace was not affected by any operational parameters studied. Furthermore, OLR did not result in any statistically significant change in hydrogen production rate. The results indicated that achieving high and stable H2 production with non-sterile wastewaters with a complex nature is a challenging issue."
