0,Introduction,"With the development of industrialization, the energy shortage and the environmental problems caused by the burning of fossil fuels are getting worse. Photocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen can effectively solve the energy crisis and environmental pollution. In 1972, it was found that TiO2 showed activity toward water splitting under light irradiation [1]. Since then, photocatalysis had entered people’s field of vision, and photocatalytic water splitting into hydrogen has attracted more and more attention. Due to the unique band structure of semiconductors, it can be used as catalysts in the field of photocatalysis. Under light irradiation, the electrons in the valence band (VB) of the semiconductor can be excited to the conduction band (CB), generating electrons and holes. The electrons on CB participated in the reduction reaction, while the holes on VB participated in the oxidation reaction [2]. Typical semiconductors, such as TiO2 and CdS [3,4], can be used in the photocatalytic water splitting reaction. Over the past few decades, a variety of photocatalysts, such as metal oxides [4–6], metal sulfide [7–9], oxynitrides [10–12], and nitrides [13,14] had been designed and prepared for the photocatalytic water splitting. However, there are still some problems to be solved in the practical application of photocatalysts [15]. For example, the great mass of metal oxides can only use ultraviolet light due to their wide band gap, while ultraviolet light made up only a tiny proportion of the sunlight. Severe recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes is an important factor affecting photocatalytic activity. Effective electrons and holes separation was the key to high-efficiency hydrogen production from photocatalytic water splitting [2]. TiO2, the typical metal oxide semiconductor, was regarded as an excellent photocatalyst material because of its low cost, non-toxicity, chemical stability, and suitable energy band structure. The conduction potential of TiO2 was negative enough to meet the thermodynamic requirement of reducing H+ to H2 [16]. Therefore, TiO2 was widely used in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution [17–19]. However, TiO2 had the disadvantage that the band gap was too wide to absorb visible light and the electron-hole pairs recombined seriously. To solve the these problems, a lot of strategies were utilized to enhance the photocatalytic performance of TiO2, such as formation of oxygen vacancies [20–22], co-catalyst loading [23], impurity doping [15,24], and construction of heterojunction [17,25,26], etc. Among these methods, the formation of heterojunction greatly promoted the transfer and the separation of photogenerated charge carriers. Bi-based semiconductors are widely used in photocatalytic water splitting. The valence bands of BiVO4 [27], BiWO6 [28], and BiYO3 [29] are composed of Bi 6s and O 2p hybrid orbitals, which have excellent visible light capture ability and photocatalytic activity [30]. Among them, BiYO3 has a band gap of 2.6 eV, which could absorb and utilize visible light. The characteristics of the visible light response of BiYO3 have attracted a lot of attention. However, there are still several defects restricting its application, such as low carrier transport and light absorption efficiency. There are few researches on BiYO3-based photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. Meanwhile, by constructing heterojunction in photocatalyst, the effective separation of electron hole pairs can be realized and the photocatalytic activity of composite can be improved. For example, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate over g-C3N4/BiYO3 was 8.4 times higher than that of g-C3N4 [29]. The photocatalytic activity was greatly improved for the AgI–BiYO3 composite as compared to that of BiYO3 [31]. BiYO3 can enhance visible light response and effectively facilitate the separation of photo-production electron-hole pairs in the application of composite photocatalyst. In this work, to take advantage of the TiO2 and the BiYO3, TiO2/BiYO3 was prepared for the first time by the Sol-Gel method and used for the photocatalytic water splitting. The heterojunction between TiO2 and BiYO3 is favorable for the transfer of photoinduced charge carriers, which greatly enhance the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts The BiYO3 photocatalysts were prepared by a hydrothermal method according to the literature [32], The TiO2/BiYO3 photocatalysts were prepared by the improved Sol-Gel method. Briefly, 17 mL tetrabutyl titanate was added into 22 mL absolute ethyl alcohol and stirred vigorously at room temperature for 10 min. The solution is labeled as solution A. Then, 5 mL deionized water and 10 mL CH3COOH solution was added into 5 mL absolute ethyl alcohol and was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 10 min, the solution is labeled as solution B. Subsequently, solution B was added dropwise into solution A, the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 20 min and aged for 12 h. Then the mixture was dried at 100 °C for 12 h to obtain the TiO2 precursor. 0.1 g BiYO3 was mixed with 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9 g TiO2 precursor, respectively, and ground in the agate mortar for 30 min. Then the mixture was annealed at 500 °C for 3 h to obtain TiO2/BiYO3 photocatalysts. The TiO2/BiYO3 photocatalyst was labeled TB-x, where the x was the mass ratio of TiO2 precursor to BiYO3. As comparison, the TiO2 precursor follows by annealing at 500 °C for 3 h to obtain TiO2."
3,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction,"2.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction The photocatalytic produce hydrogen reaction was carried out in a quartz reactor (CEL-APR100, Ceaulight, China) with a light source irradiated from the top. The light source was provided by a 300 W Xe lamp (CEL-HXF300, Ceaulight, China), and the light intensity of the Xe lamp was measured to be 110 mW/cm2 20 mg photocatalyst was added into 100 mL water solution with 20 vol% methanol as the hole scavenger and evenly dispersed in the solution by ultrasonication. Before the light irradiation, the ultrahigh pure argon was pumped into the reactor for 30 min to completely remove dissolved oxygen. Under light irradiation, the solution was continuously stirred at 500 rpm. The reaction temperature was kept at 25 °C by the circulating cooling water. The gas product was collected every hour for hydrogen production detection. The hydrogen was quantitative analyzed by a SHIMADZU GC2018 gas chromatograph equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 5 Å molecular sieve column. The ultrahigh pure argon was selected as carrier gas."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was performed on a SMARTLAB3KW X-ray powder diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation). The field emission scanning electronic microscopy (FE-SEM) images were collected with a Hitachi SU-8220 SEM system at 5 kV. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the samples were obtained on an aberration-corrected FEI Titan G2 ETEM microscope and a JEM-2100F (JEOL, Japan) microscope. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping were obtained on a JEM-2100F (JEOL, Japan) microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on an ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer, and the X-ray source was A1 Ka-ray (150 W). The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum was measured in a Bruker TENSOR II infrared spectrometer. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded using a TU-1901 UV–vis is spectrophotometer."
5,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurement was performed on a CHI760E electrochemical workstation. The standard three-electrode cell consists of reference electrode (Ag/AgCl electrode), counter electrode (Pt mesh), and working electrode. A 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte solution for all the PEC measurement. The photocatalyst was used as raw material to prepare the working electrode. 4 mg of the samples were added to a mixture of 250 μL ethanol, 250 μL deionized water, and 20 μL of Nafion® solutions (Sigma Aldrich, 5 wt% in mixture of lower aliphatic alcohols and water, contains 45% water). The samples were then evenly dispersed in the solution by ultrasound for 1 h 20 μL mixed solution was dripped onto the FTO substrate surface and evenly spread out. The working electrode was obtained by drying at room temperature. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was texted in a range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz with an AC amplitude of 5 mV. The transient photocurrent was tested in the three-electrode system. The light source was provided by the same Xe lamp as the photocatalytic reaction above. The Mott-Schottky curves were measured in the same standard three-electrode cell at a certain potential range with an amplitude of 5 mV and frequency of 500, 1000, and 1500 Hz."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Crystal structure and morphology,"3.1 Crystal structure and morphology Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of the TiO2, BiYO3, and TiO2/BiYO3 composites. As shown in Fig. 1, XRD diffraction peaks of TiO2 located at 25.57, 38.05, 48.34, 54.04, 55.36, 62.98, 69.06, 70.58, 75.35, and 83.07° can be assigned to the (101), (112), (200), (105), (211), (204), (116), (220), (215), and (312) plane of anatase TiO2 [33]. In addition, the XRD diffraction peaks of BiYO3 at 28.58, 33.01, 47.36, 56.14, 58.85, 69.06, 76.44, and 78.69° belonged to the (111), (200), (220), (311), (222), (400), (331), and (420) plane of BiYO3 [30]. From the XRD pattern of the TiO2/BiYO3 composites, it can be seen that the peaks of TiO2 and BiYO3 can be observed, indicating the composite is consist of TiO2 and BiYO3. Moreover, as the content of the TiO2 increased, the intensity of the diffraction peaks of TiO2 increased while the peaks of BiYO3 gradually decreased. In addition, with the increase of TiO2, the slight shift of the peak at 28.58° of BiYO3 may be attributed to lattice distortion or lattice disparity in the crystal [34]. It is possible that lattice distorted and quality of lattice declined during the preparation process of TiO2/BiYO3 composites. Furthermore, the lattice distortion can be observed in the HRTEM images of TB-7 (Fig. 2 f). The TEM and HRTEM images of TiO2, BiYO3, and TB-7 was shown in Fig. 2. The TEM images show the granular-shaped TiO2 and the sheet-like BiYO3. In this case, it is possible to form the point-face contact interface in the TiO2/BiYO3 composites, thus enhance their photocatalytic performance. The TEM images (Fig. 2c) of the TB-7 indicated that the TiO2 nanoparticles distributed uniformly on the BiYO3 nanosheets. As shown in Fig. 2d and e, the distinct lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.35 and 0.31 nm were assigned to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2 [19] and the (111) plane of BiYO3 [30], respectively. From the HRTEM (Fig. 2f) image of TB-7, that the clear lattice fringes of TiO2 (d = 0.35 nm) and the fringes of BiYO3 (d = 0.31 nm) can be obviously observed, indicating that the TB-7 is composed of TiO2 and BiYO3, which is consistent with the XRD results. Moreover, an obvious lattice distortion can be observed in the HRTEM image of TB-7, indicating the strong interaction between the TiO2 and BiYO3. Moreover, the interface between the TiO2 and BiYO3 can also be obviously observed in the HRTEM images of TB-7. The formation of the interface and the lattice distortion can not only improve the separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs, but also provide additional active sites for hydrogen evolution. To further confirm the formation of the interface and the lattice distortion, more HRTEM images of TB-7 sample can be found in Fig. S1 in the Supporting Information. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) spectrum explicitly show the existence of Ti, O, Bi, and Y in the TB-7 sample (Fig. 3 i). Moreover, the corresponding EDX mapping (Fig. 3 b-j) at the region shown in Fig. 3a further confirm the uniform dispersion of Ti, O, Bi, and Y elements. The EDX elemental mapping and EDX spectrum of another region in TB-7 were shown in Fig. S2 in the Supporting Information."
8,XPS and FTIR analysis,"3.2 XPS and FTIR analysis The XPS results of TiO2, BiYO3, and TB-7 were shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1 . The high-resolution Ti 2p spectrum of TiO2 (Fig. 4a) exhibited two strong peaks at 464.2 and 458.5 eV, corresponding to Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 [35], respectively, suggesting that Ti existed in the chemical states of Ti4+ in the TiO2 sample. When the TiO2 was combined with BiYO3, the binding energy of Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 shifted to 464.3 and 458.6 eV, respectively, indicating the interaction between the TiO2 and BiYO3. As shown in Fig. 4b, three peaks at 529.8, 530.8, and 532.6 eV can be observed in the high-resolution O 1s spectrum of TiO2, which corresponding to the lattice oxygen in the TiO2 [36], the oxygen in the hydroxyl group (-OH) on the surface of photocatalysts [37], and the oxygen absorbed on the surface (O−) [38], respectively. The high-resolution O 1s spectrum of BiYO3 displayed three peaks located at 529.3, 531.4 and 533.2 eV, which could be attributed to the lattice oxygen (Bi–O), oxygen in the surface hydroxyl group (-OH), and oxygen absorbed on the surface (O−), respectively. Notably, the O 1s spectrum of TiO2/BiYO3 composite displayed four peaks, and the binding energy of lattice oxygen (Ti–O) and lattice oxygen (Bi–O) shifted to 529.7 and 530.0 eV, respectively, compared to that of TiO2 and BiYO3 alone. In the high-resolution Bi 4f spectrum (Fig. 4c), the binding energy located at around 163.7 and 156.4 eV was ascribed to Bi 4f7/2 [42], while the peak located at 158.4 eV belonged to the Bi 4f5/2 [43], illustrating that the Bi was in the form of Bi3+ in the BiYO3 [30,32,44,45]. Compared to BiYO3, the binding energy of Bi 4f7/2 shifted to 164.3 and 159.0 eV, respectively, and the binding energy of Bi 4f5/2 shifted to 157.2 eV. For the Y 3p spectra (Fig. 4d) of BiYO3, the peaks at 312.1 and 300.2 eV suggested that the Y was in the form of Y3+ in BiYO3 [46]. When the TiO2 was combined with BiYO3, the binding energy of Y 3p3/2 and Y 3p1/2 shifted to 312.5 and 300.6 eV, respectively, compared to that of BiYO3. The changes in the binding energy indicated the intimate interaction between the TiO2 and the BiYO3. The FTIR spectra of TiO2, BiYO3, and TiO2/BiYO3 composites was shown in Fig. 5 . From the FTIR spectra of all the samples, the peak around 3440 cm−1 and 1630 cm−1 can be obvious observed, which can be ascribed to the O–H stretching and bending vibrations of the surface hydroxyls, which is due to the absorbed water on the surface of the catalyst [47]. For BiYO3 sample, the band at 521 and 1477 cm−1 were ascribed to the stretching vibration of Bi–O and the vibration of Y–O, respectively [31,47]. The peaks observed at 1389 and 845 cm−1 can be assigned to the NO3 − of bismuth nitrate [48], demonstrating the BiYO3 was successfully synthesized by using the bismuth nitrate and the Bi source. For TiO2, the bands at 662 cm−1 can be ascribed to the Ti–O vibration modes in the Ti3+–O–Ti4+ framework of TiO2 [49]. Notably, both the peaks of TiO2 and BiYO3 can be observed in the FTIR spectra of TiO2/BiYO3 composites, indicating that the TiO2/BiYO3 composites is consist of TiO2 and BiYO3, which is in accordance with the XRD results."
9,Light-harvesting capability,"3.3 Light-harvesting capability The light absorption capability of the photocatalysts was studied by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra. As shown in Fig. 6 , TiO2 can only absorb light in the ultraviolet light region (<380 nm). All of the TiO2/BiYO3 composites exhibit higher light absorption intensity than pristine TiO2. Furthermore, the band gap of TiO2 and BiYO3 was determined to be 3.21 and 2.58 eV, respectively, from the Tauc plots [50] in the inset. With the increase of TiO2 content, the visible light absorption intensity and spectral absorption range of TiO2/BiYO3 composite gradually decreases. The decrease in the visible light absorption of the TiO2/BiYO3 composites was due to the wide band gap of TiO2."
10,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"3.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements Photoelectrochemical measurements characterized the transfer of photo-production carriers and the separation of photogeneration electron-holes [51]. As shown in Fig. 7 a, the TiO2/BiYO3 composites showed higher transient photocurrent than that of TiO2. Moreover, the TB-7 sample exhibited the strongest transient photocurrent response among the TiO2/BiYO3 composites. The results of the transient photocurrent response indicated that the separation of photo-production electron-hole pairs was enhanced after the TiO2 coupling with the BiYO3. The electrochemical impedance spectra (Fig. 7b) in the darkness showed that the arc radius of TiO2/BiYO3 composites was visibly smaller than that of TiO2, and the TB-7 exhibited the smallest arc radius. The smaller arc radius of the Nyquist plot suggests excellent separation of electron–hole pairs in the photocatalyst [52]. Therefore, the result of the electrochemical impedance spectra demonstrated more efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers in the TiO2/BiYO3 composites. Such enhanced charge separation and migration greatly enhance the photocatalytic activity of the TiO2/BiYO3 heterostructures."
11,Photocatalytic activity,"3.5 Photocatalytic activity Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction experiments of TiO2, BiYO3, and TiO2/BiYO3 composites were carried out with methanol as the hole scavenger, and the result was shown in Fig. 8 . BiYO3 and TiO2 exhibited a very low hydrogen evolution production of 11.1 μmol gcat −1 and 62.2 μmol gcat −1, respectively, after 4 h reaction. As expected, TB-7 sample showed the optimum hydrogen evolution production of 635.5 μmol gcat −1. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of TiO2/BiYO3 was due to the formation of heterojunction by the coupling of TiO2 and BiYO3. The heterojunction facilitated the effective separation of photo-production electrons and holes. The optimum photocatalytic hydrogen evolution production of TB-7 was 57 and 10 times higher that of BiYO3 and TiO2, respectively. Under light irradiation, the photo-production electrons on the conduction band of TiO2 transferred and accumulated to the conduction band of BiYO3, the photogenerated holes on the valence band of the TiO2 transferred and accumulated on the valence band of BiYO3. The heterojunction formed between TiO2 and BiYO3 facilitated the transfer of electrons and holes. Notably, the photocatalytic activity was enhanced with the increase of TiO2 content. However, when the mass ratio of TiO2 to BiYO3 increases to 9, the superabundant TiO2 will increase the recombination of the photoinduced electrons and holes, resulting in a reduction in hydrogen production. Furthermore, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the TB-7 was calculated to be 13.4% at 380 nm, and the calculation method of AQE can be found in the Supporting Information. In addition, even though the photocatalytic performance of the TiO2/BiYO3 composites is lower than that of some TiO2-based photocatalysts, such as the TiO2 p-n homojunction [53], TiO2@MoS2 [54], and hierarchical TiO2 nanocrystals [55], the H2 evolution rate of TB-7 (158.88 μmol gcat −1 h−1) is higher than that of the other TiO2-based photocatalyst, such as Ag/Bi2MoO6/TiO2 (143.5 μmol gcat −1 h−1) [56] and BiVO4@TiO2 (120 μmol gcat −1 h−1) [57]. Besides, BiYO3 was also used to combine with other photocatalysts to enhance their photocatalytic performance, such as the AgI–BiYO3 [31] and the g-C3N4/BiYO3 [29]. Therefore, it is an effective strategy to combine the BiYO3 with TiO2 for enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production. The stability of the photocatalyst played an important role in the application of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The stability of TB-7 was investigated by cyclic experiments. After each cycle, the accumulated H2 in the reactor was evacuated by Ar gas. As shown in Fig. 9 , after 6 cycles, the photocatalytic hydrogen production is almost unchanged, indicating that the excellent stability of the TiO2/BiYO3. Combined with the previous characterization, stability test showed that a tight heterojunction was formed between TiO2 and BiYO3, and the heterojunction was stable during the photocatalytic reaction."
12,Photocatalytic mechanism,"3.6 Photocatalytic mechanism For the photocatalytic reaction, the redox capacity of photocatalyst is related to the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) position. The Mott-Schottky measurement was carried out to determine the type and the flat band potential of the TiO2 and BiYO3. As shown in Fig. 10 , the Mott Schottky plots of TiO2 and BiYO3 display a positive slope, which indicates that both TiO2 and BiYO3 are the typical n-type semiconductor. According to the intercept of Mott Schottky plots on the E axis, the obtained flat band position of TiO2 and BiYO3 is −0.58 and −0.35 V relative to the Ag/AgCl electrode potential, respectively. The potential measured according to the Ag/AgCl electrode can be converted into NHE potential using Equation of E (NHE, pH = 7) = E (Ag/AgCl) – Eϴ + 0.059 × pH [58,59]. Where Eϴ (Ag/AgCl, pH = 7) = 0.197 V. Therefore, the flat band potential of TiO2 and BiYO3 are calculated to be −0.36 and −0.13 V versus NHE potential, respectively. For n-type semiconductors, the flat band potential is about 0.3 V below the conduction band minimum [60]. Therefore, the conduction band potential of TiO2 and BiYO3 are −0.66 and −0.43 V, respectively. According to the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 6), the bandgap (Eg) of TiO2 and BiYO3 are 3.21 and 2.58 eV, respectively. Thus, the VB of TiO2 and BiYO3 are calculated to be 2.55 and 2.15 V, respectively, via the equation of VB = Eg + CB. According to the above results, a mechanism of TiO2/BiYO3 for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under light irradiation was put forward and showed in Fig. 11 . Under light irradiation, the electrons in the valence band (VB) of TiO2 can be excited to the conduction band (CB), generating electrons and holes. The photo-excited electrons in the CB of TiO2 readily transferred to the CB of BiYO3, while the photogenerated holes transfer from the VB of TiO2 to the VB of BiYO3, forming the Type I heterojunction (Fig. 11). In the Type I heterojunction, photo-production electrons and holes had different transfer pathways, which can avoid the recombination of electrons and holes. Moreover, the difference in the rate of electrons and holes transfer to the reduction and oxidation site reduced the recombination of electrons and holes on BiYO3 [2,61]. Therefore, the photo-production electrons were accumulated in the CB of BiYO3 and the H+ is reduced to H2 on the surface of the BiYO3, while the holes were consumed by the CH3OH sacrificial agent consumed the holes."
13,Conclusions,"In summary, TiO2/BiYO3 composites were successfully prepared by the improved Sol-Gel method. The Type I heterojunction formed between the TiO2 and BiYO3 promotes the transfer and separation of the photo-production electron-hole pair, thus significantly enhanced the photocatalytic activity of the TiO2/BiYO3 photocatalyst. The photocatalytic hydrogen production of the optimized TiO2/BiYO3 composites (TB-7) was over 57 times and 10 times higher than that of BiYO3 and TiO2, respectively. Moreover, the AQE of TB-7 reached 13.4% at 380 nm. This study highlighted the potential application of BiYO3 as the co-catalyst for the other semiconductor photocatalysts, and the TiO2/BiYO3 composites was a promising photocatalyst for the photocatalytic hydrogen production."
