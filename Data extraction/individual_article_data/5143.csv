0,Introduction,"The price volatility of crude oil on the world market, the dwindling of crude oil reserves, as well as environmental concerns resulting from its utilization among other factors have led to increased and extensive research on alternative feedstocks such as biomass, coal, natural and shale gas and their plausible conversion routes into syngas [1]. Syngas as an alternative feedstock is versatile with opportunities for development since it finds application in the direct synthesis of olefins, ultra-clean gasoline and diesel, high quality waxes, valuable oxygenates and chemicals, and higher alcohols [2]. Higher alcohols (C2 and C2+OH), commonly refer to short-chain alcohols higher than methanol, and can be used as automotive fuels, fuel additives for octane enhancement, and value-added chemicals in fine chemical synthesis [3,4]. These oxygenated fuels burn more cleanly than fossil fuels, mitigating environmental footprints such as noxious CO emissions and net atmospheric CO2 content [1]. It is also worth mentioning that in order to obtain these valuable chemical products and alternative green fuels from syngas conversion, the catalyst used therein the process becomes pivotal. Among the four typical catalysts with potential application for Higher Alcohol Synthesis (HAS) namely; Rh-based catalysts [5], modified high-temperature (ZnO/Cr2O3) and low-temperature (Cu/ZnO/Al2O3) methanol catalysts [6], modified Fischer Tropsch (FT) catalysts (based on Fe, Co and Ru) [7], and MoS2-based catalysts [8], the latter is the most promising catalytic systems due to its high resistance to sulfur poisoning, deactivation by coking, and high selectivity for C1-C5 linear primary alcohols when secondary promoters (such as Co & Rh) are incorporated [9]. Carbon-based supported MoS2 catalysts, promoted with Co and Rh have garnered immense attention in the conversion of syngas to higher alcohols via the Fischer Tropsch synthesis process [10]. Carbonaceous materials such as ordered mesoporous carbons (OMC) have received considerable focus due to their potential applications in a wide range of fields including catalysis, adsorption or sensor technology. Though, these porous carbon materials possess desirable textural properties (tunable pore sizes, high surface areas, and large pore volumes), applications in catalysis becomes limited as a result of their chemical inertness, minimal surface functionality and their hydrophobic nature [11]. Thus, to enhance their surface chemistry for practical catalysis application, carbon materials are usually subjected to post-synthesis treatment techniques including chemical oxidation (liquid or gas phase), polymer coating and grafting [12,13] in order to improve their hydrophilicity as well as generate the necessary surface oxygen groups for interacting with catalytic species. Regarding surface chemistry modification via oxidation, the most studied carbon-based materials include activated carbon and carbon nanotubes [13]. To a large extent, the introduced oxygen-containing groups play the role as weak acids or bases, which possess ion exchange properties. For instance, acidic groups such as carboxyl, phenolic hydroxyl, lactone and quinone can be introduced to the surface of the carbon material leading to significant changes of the surface chemistry; hence, its application as catalyst support or adsorbent [14]. Commonly used treatment protocols include oxidative treatment (wet or dry), plasma treatment, and electrochemical modifications [15,16] where as dry chemical oxidation employs gaseous oxidizing agents (e.g. oxygen, ozone and carbon dioxide), its wet counterpart uses individual solutions of nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid or a mixture with hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite, permanganate etc., to accomplish a similar purpose [13–16]. Among the series of different oxidants studied (including HNO3 and H2O2), Pradhan and coworkers observed HNO3 treatment as the most effective regarding modification of the surface area and porosity of activated carbons [15]. Also, treatment of CNT with 68% HNO3 under reflux conditions introduced carboxylic groups on the surface and ends of the nanotubes as reported by Tsang et al. [17]. Similarly, chemical oxidation treatments as reported recently by Ryoo and coworkers evidenced that the carbon framework remained intact after surface modification of CMK-1 and CMK-5 by oxidation with concentrated nitric acid at 110°C for 15min [18]. Moreso, the same workers reported in a previous study that OMC can maintain an ordered structure even in boiling 5M aqueous solution of NaOH, KOH, or H2SO4 over a week, showing strong resistance to attack by acids and bases [19]. However, Lu and co-workers modified the surface chemistry of CMK-5 carbon using the mild oxidizing agent H2O2 in order to introduce surface oxygen groups while its ordered structure was maintained, but surprisingly a structural collapse occurred [16]. In this study, surface modification of pristine OMC (i.e. not functionalized) supports via wet chemical oxidation treatments using HNO3, NH4OH/H2O2, and KOH have been investigated and subsequently evaluated for their catalytic performance for the conversion of syngas to higher alcohols at similar metals loading using laboratory-scale fixed bed reactor under industrial conditions. In addition, the untreated OMC-supported-KCoRhMo catalyst were also evaluated at similar conditions to benchmark performance via screening with syngas feedstock for the HAS reaction."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of pristine OMC support with F127 as template,"2.1 Synthesis of pristine OMC support with F127 as template Synthesis of the pristine OMC support followed procedure described in the literature [20] with some modification. Poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) block copolymer (F127) was used as the starting soft template and phloroglucinol was employed as the phenolic compound to enhance the polymerization reaction of phenols with formaldehyde under acidic conditions [21]. The block copolymer Pluronic F127 (Mav =12,600, EO97PO67EO97) and phloroglucinol were procured from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. The nominal molar ratio of the chemicals used in the synthesis medium was 0.0008 F127: 0.008 Phloroglucinol: 0.0099 Formaldehyde: 0.004 HCl: 0.435 Ethanol. In a typical synthesis protocol, 1.0g each of phloroglucinol and F127 template were dissolved in 20g of ethanol solution at 15°C under mechanical stirring. After the solid was completely dissolved, 0.39g of 37% HCl was added to the solution as a catalyst and stirring continued at the same temperature for an additional 2h until a light pink color appeared. Subsequently, 0.8g of 37% formaldehyde solution was added to the obtained solution and stirring continued for approximately 50min until the mixture turned turbid. The solution was then poured into petri dishes to facilitate the evaporation of ethanol at room temperature (for about 12h), followed by heating in an oven at 100°C for 24h. The as-made products were scraped out of the petri dishes and crushed into chunks. To carbonize the obtained product, the sample was pyrolyzed in a tubular furnace at 600°C for 4h using a heating rate of 1°C/min under N2 atmosphere (at a flow rate of 50mL/min)."
3,Chemical oxidation of pristine OMC supports,"2.2 Chemical oxidation of pristine OMC supports Chemical oxidation of the pristine OMC was necessary in order to modify the surface chemistry of the material. In this work, the oxidizing agents used include 30wt.% nitric acid, a mixture of NH4OH/H2O2 and KOH. Pristine OMC support treatments followed procedure described in the literature [22] with modification. In a typical treatment, 2g of the pristine OMC support was dispersed in 215mL of the nitric acid (70wt%) in a 500mL round bottom flask equipped with a condenser and immersed in an oil bath maintained at 100°C. The mixture was kept under reflux condition with magnetic stirring for 12h and subsequently diluted with de-ionized water, filtered, and washed multiple times until a neutral pH was attained. The resulting solid sample was then oven dried at 120°C for 12h. For the NH4OH/H2O2 treatment, 2g of pristine was dispersed in 215mL of a mixture of 25wt% NH4OH and 30wt% H2O2 (in ratio 50:50) in a 500mL round bottom flask and similar treatments was followed as described above. Finally, for the KOH treatment, 30wt% KOH solution was made by dissolving the required amount of KOH pellets in 500mL of de-ionized water in a round bottom flask and reaction proceeded as in above. Henceforth, the chemically treated supports can be designated as OMC-HNO3, OMC-NH4OH/H2O2, and OMC-KOH for the HNO3, NH4OH/H2O2, and KOH treatments, respectively."
4,Preparation of K-promoted CoRhMo/OMC catalysts,"2.3 Preparation of K-promoted CoRhMo/OMC catalysts The preparation of OMC-supported K-CoRhMo catalysts (chemically treated or untreated) followed a similar procedure described previously [23,24]. In brief, the pre-treated supports were alkalized using the required amount of aqueous solution of K2CO3, dried at 100°C for 6h, followed by stabilization at 300°C in argon flow of 50mL/min at a heating rate of 10°C/min for 4h. Consequently, co-impregnation of the respective metal (Co, Mo, Rh) species was performed using ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate (Alfa-Aesar), potassium carbonate (Sigma-Aldrich), cobalt acetate tetrahydrate (Alfa-Aesar), and rhodium chloride hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) as precursors for Mo, K, Co, and Rh, respectively. The oxidic form of the dried powder K-doped CoRhMo samples were obtained after 4h of oven drying at 100°C, followed by stabilization at 450°C under argon flow of 50mL/min at a heating rate of 10°C/min for 12h. The final catalyst composition (wt.%) of 9% K, 15% Mo, 4.5% Co and 1.5% Rh, respectively, is to be attained. A similar approach was as well used to co-impregnate metal precursors on the pristine (untreated) OMC support. Herein, the fine powder forms of the catalysts are designated are as follows: KCoRhMo/Untreated OMC (Cat-UnOMC), KCoRhMo/OMC-HNO3 (Cat-HNO3), KCoRhMo/OMC-NH4OH/H2O2 (Cat-NH4OH/H2O2) and KCoRhMo/OMC-KOH (Cat-KOH), respectively."
5,Characterization of supports and catalysts,"2.4 Characterization of supports and catalysts Textural properties of the supports and catalysts were analyzed by the N2-adsorption/desorption technique. The N2 physisorption isotherms were measured on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer at liquid nitrogen temperature of 77K to determine the specific surface area, pore volume, and average pore diameter of prepared samples using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method in the standard pressure range 0.05–0.30P/Po. Detailed description of the procedure can be found in the literature [24,25]. The pore diameter and pore size distributions were calculated from the adsorption and desorption branches of the isotherms using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. The mesopore volume was determined from the N2 adsorbed at a P/P0 =0.4. The total pore volume was calculated from the amount of nitrogen adsorbed at P/P0 =0.95, assuming that adsorption on the external surface was negligible compared with adsorption in pores. In all cases, correlation coefficients above 0.999 were obtained. Laser Raman analyses of the carbon supports were carried out using a Raman imaging equipment (Renishaw Invia Raman Microscope) running WiRE software – version 1.3, with the following pre-set parameters to determine the quality of carbon structure: wave length of laser excitation, λ=514nm, laser power=∼1mW, exposure time=30s, microscope objective=50, and 1800l/mm grating. Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectra were recorded in the range 400–4000cm−1 wave numbers with a JASCO FT-IR 4100 using pellets prepared with spectroscopic grade potassium bromide (KBr). Surface functional groups present on the catalyst samples were qualitatively determined by this technique using 32 scans with a nominal resolution of 4cm−1. Transmission Emission Microscopy (TEM) was used to study the morphological features of the support and catalysts. Electron micrographs were obtained using a JEOL 2011 scanning transmission electron microscope equipped with Gatan Imaging Filter (GIF 2000) to facilitate imaging at 200keV using low to high magnifications, in the range of 20–500k times magnification. Prior to sample analysis, the powder samples were sonicated in ethanol using an ultrasonic bath for 1h, followed by deposition of the resultant solution on a 200mesh carbon-coated copper grid. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction patterns of the powder catalyst samples were recorded on a Rigaku diffractometer using high intensity Cu Kα radiation source (λ= 0.1541nm). Scanning of each sample was performed at a rate of 0.05°/s within a 2θ range of 10–80°. The phases present were identified using the JCPDS diffraction files by matching the corresponding diffraction peaks or patterns. The H2-TPR profiles of the catalysts were performed in order to study the reducibility of the metal species in the catalysts. The stabilized catalyst sample (0.2g) was first purged in a flow of argon at 170°C to remove traces of water, and then cooled to 40°C. Then the TPR of each sample was performed using 3.1% H2 in He gas stream at a flow rate of 30mL/min at atmospheric pressure using an automated Quantachrome gas sorption instrument (AUTOSORB IQ TPD-TPR analyzer) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector, heating at a linearly programmed rate of 10°C/min up to 700°C. The amount of chemisorbed hydrogen was measured using the AUTOSORB IQ TPD-TPR analyzer system. The stabilized catalyst sample (0.2g) was first purged in a flow of argon at 170°C to remove traces of water. The temperature was then raised to 700°C at a linearly programmed rate of 10°C/min and the temperature reduction profiles of the catalyst samples recorded."
6,Catalytic activity,"2.5 Catalytic activity The feedstock used for this study was commercially available syngas mixture (composition: 10% Ar:40% CO:50% H2), procured from Praxair, Canada. The CO conversion and selectivity of desired products for the catalytic performance evaluation was achieved using the as-received syngas composition in a single cylinder. The reactor used for the higher alcohol synthesis experiments was a single-pass downward flow fixed bed reactor system made of Inconel and with dimensions 22mm ID; 450mm length [24]. Briefly, 12mL of 90mesh size silicon carbide particles was employed as catalyst diluents per 2g of catalyst so as to enhance heat and mass transfer along the length of the reactor. Prior to catalytic activity study, an initial sulfidation/reduction of the catalyst was necessary to convert the inactive oxidic form of the catalyst to a more active sulfidic phase using a gas mixture containing 10mol % H2S (balance H2) at a flow rate of 50mL/min and sulfidation/reduction conducted at 450°C (rate of 2°C/min) for 6h. Subsequently, the temperature was then lowered to the reaction temperature and the system pressurized to the reaction conditions. The synthesis gas mixture was then introduced via mass flow controllers and the higher alcohols synthesis reaction conducted under steady-state at reaction conditions of 300–340°C, 8.3MPa (1300 psig), and a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 3.6m3 (STP)/(h kg cat) over a period of 24h. The product gas was cooled to 0°C in a cold trap to separate it into gaseous and liquid phases at the reaction pressure. The gaseous products were vented hourly via an exit sampling valve through an online Shimadzu gas chromatograph instrument equipped with an integrated thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Using Ar as the tie component for CO conversion computations, the overall mass balance of the reaction was determined. The liquid products were collected after 24h reaction period and analyzed with a Varian 3400 gas chromatograph equipped with a Stabil Wax capillary column and a flame ionization detector (FID). The volume and weight of liquid products were measured to check the mass balance. The experiments were repeated at least twice to check reproducibility and to confirm that the results obtained were within the experimental error of ±3%."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Support and catalyst characterizations,"3.1 Support and catalyst characterizations 3.1.1 N2-adsorption/desorption measurement Nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements performed at liquid nitrogen temperature of −196°C is one of the generally used techniques to ascertain textural properties of porous materials [26]. Fig. 1 (A & B) show the isotherms of the four supports (untreated or chemically treated) and their respective OMC-supported KCoRhMo catalysts. As evidenced in these figures, the occurrence of textural mesoporosity with uniform cylindrical pores can be confirmed from the profiles of the chemically treated supports and catalysts; exhibiting the type IV isotherms with H1 hysteresis loop [24,27]. For the untreated support and Cat-UnOMC catalyst, the isotherms appear not to be prominently distinct as compared to its treated counterparts; probably due to the presence of carbon impurities prior to chemical treatment. For the application of these catalysts in CO hydrogenation reactions, which is predominantly a surface phenomenon, the porosity as well as the surface area of the catalyst is of a great essence. This is due to the fact that the porosity of the material controls the mass transfer processes via diffusion, which occurs during the adsorption of reactants, surface reaction and subsequent products desorption into the bulk medium. It is clear from Fig. 1(A & B) that co-impregnation of metal precursors onto the various supports did not significantly change the shape of the type IV isotherms as depicted in these figures. This indicates that supported catalysts exhibited uniform textural porosity after metals loading, as corroborated by TEM results. The sharpness of the desorption branches is indicative of the narrow mesopore size distribution. This is important since it shows that the textural mesoporosity of the catalyst was not overly compromised following the introduction of metal species within the mesopores of the supports [24]. Also, the pore size distribution profiles for the OMC supports and supported KCoMoRh catalysts are given in Fig. 2 A and B, respectively. It is clear that the cumulative volume of N2 desorbed by the OMC supports (both untreated and treated) is more as compared to their respective catalysts; suggesting that incorporation of metal precursors partially filled portions of the pore volume. In contrast, a much broader pore size distribution profile was evidenced in the pristine support and its corresponding catalysts as compared to the treated counterparts of the same. One could reason that chemical treatments of the OMC supports resulted in the removal of impurities from the carbon structure during its synthesis; thus, contributing to the narrower pore size distribution profile observed in both the treated supports as well as their corresponding catalysts. In addition, a significant merging of smaller pores into much larger ones could be observed and attributed to the sudden one-step heat treatment of the pristine supported catalyst during the calcination step. It is known that the presence of catalysts metals in carbon materials may affect its porosity during the calcination step [23]. This characteristic broader pore size distribution resulting from the merging of smaller pores may have contributed to the observed lower alcohol productivity exhibited by Cat-UnOMC during the HAS reaction. Table 1 gives a summary of the textural properties of the pristine OMC and chemically treated supports as well as the OMC-supported KCoRhMo catalysts. It is worth mentioning that acid pre-treatment of pristine carbon materials such as MWCNTs resulted in the opening of the closed ends and caps of the pristine material and also significantly improved its textural properties [28]. In the case of OMC materials studied, chemical treatments of the supports resulted in increases in surface area, pore volume and pore diameters in comparison to the pristine OMC support. Specific surface area and pore volume increments in the ranges of 2.7–20% and 4.4–72%, respectively, were recorded for the chemically treated supports as compared to the untreated support. The HNO3 treated support showed the highest surface area as well as pore volume, while the least of the parameters were recorded by the KOH treated support. For the catalysts, decreases in surface area and pore volumes were recorded for all supports (either untreated or chemically treated), with Cat-HNO3 recording the least surface area decrement of 35%. Similarly, Cat-HNO3 showed a 35.8% pore volume decrement as compared to 45.8% as recorded by Cat-UnOMC. This suggests that between the best treated supported catalysts (Cat-HNO3) and the untreated catalyst (Cat-UnOMC), the recorded 10% difference in pore volume was quite significant for the loading of metal precursors. This is also the case for the specific surface area difference of 7% between the same materials. It can be deduced from Table 1 that the oxidizing agents used for chemical treatment evidenced different oxidizing power; thus, contributing to the significant changes in textural properties observed. It should be noted that apart from opening the closed end caps and incorporation of oxygen-containing groups on to the walls and ends of carbon nanotubes, Sigurdson et al. [28] also observed an etching effect on the surface of the tubes; thus, enhancing its surface chemical properties [28]. For the OMC supports, the added etching effect of HNO3 pre-treatment must be responsible for the increments observed in the surface area of the supports. That notwithstanding, with the incorporation of metal precursors onto the support matrix, a resultant decrease in both the surface areas and pore volumes of the catalysts was observed to follow the order: Cat-HNO3 >Cat-NH4OH/H2O2 >Cat-UnOMC>Cat-KOH; however, changes in the pore diameter of the supports did not follow a particular trend. The monotonic reduction in textural properties (specific surface area and pore volume) of the supports as a result of metal (Co, Rh, Mo) precursors loading was expected. Nonetheless, the decrease in specific surface area as a result of co-impregnation of Co, Mo, and Rh metal precursors on the supports did also significantly influenced the homogeneity of dispersed metal species on the surface of the supports, as corroborated by the X-ray powder diffraction analysis. In addition, the normalized specific surface area (NSBET) analysis of the prepared catalysts showed a similar trend (as shown above) with the deposition of metal species on the supports. Computations of the normalized SBET values of the catalysts were obtained by the equation proposed by Vradman et al. [29]: N S B E T = ( S B E T ) C a t ( 1 − x ) · ( S B E T ) S u p where NSBET is the normalized SBET and x is the weight fraction of the phases. The values of normalized NSBET are given in Table 1. The NSBET is parameter which gives a measure of the extent of pore blockage as experienced by the catalyst support during the metals loading procedure; with values close to unity suggesting less pore blockage suffered by the catalyst. For instance, NSBET of Cat-HNO3 and Cat-KOH were computed to be 0.93 and 0.78, respectively, which is<1; indicating that while the introduction of the oxidic metal nanoparticles caused a minimal reduction in pore volume for the former catalyst, the latter catalyst experienced quite a significant pore blockage. Furthermore, these results also give an indication that impregnation of metal species on a catalyst support plays a vital role in the overall catalytic surface area required for a given chemical reaction. Thus, the activity and alcohol products selectivities could be affected by the available surface areas of the respective catalysts during the surface-catalyzed HAS reaction. Similarly, the observed trend for the values of NSBET of catalysts investigated followed the order: Cat-HNO3 >Cat-NH4OH/H2O2 >Cat-UnOMC>Cat-KOH. This could be attributable to the significant changes in specific surface area of the pristine OMC support following the various chemical oxidation treatments. The specific surface areas of the support and their respective catalysts play a role in the computation of the NSBET values. At this similar metals loading for catalysts formulation (4.5%Co, 1.5%Rh & 15%Mo), one can conclude that the incorporation of metals precursors on to the OMC supports (treated and untreated) affected differently the porosity as well as the overall textural properties of the final catalysts. This observation is quite evident from the NSBET values, which gives an indication of minimal pore blockage in the HNO3 treated OMC-supported catalyst as compared to its KOH counterpart. 3.1.2 Elemental analysis Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP/MS) technique was used to ascertain the respective elemental compositions (actual wt.%) of Co, Mo, and Rh present in the prepared KCoRhMo catalysts in the oxidic state. Table 2 shows the ICP/MS results of KCoRhMo supported catalysts with their corresponding targeted compositions as well as CO uptake of the catalysts determined by CO chemisorption analysis. 3.1.3 Wide-angle X-ray diffraction The crystal phase of the sample was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Diffraction patterns of the pristine OMC & chemically treated as well as the untreated OMC-supported KCoMoRh catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 for 2θ values in the range of 10–80°. Analyses of generated XRD peaks of these samples were matched with the corresponding peaks using the JCPDS chemical spectra data bank [30–32]. The characteristic peaks occuring at 2θ=24.2° and 43.7° can be assigned to the presence of amorphous carbon (corresponding to (002) and (100) reflection, respectively) in the pristine OMC support. The broad diffraction peaks demonstrate the existence of amorphous phase in the as-made OMC [32]. Similarly, peaks occurring at 17.1, 30.4, 36.8 and 40.6 can be attributed to the crystalline MoO3. However, the more prominent graphitic peaks of the pristine OMC support diminishes in the all catalysts; suggesting that chemical treatment resulted in the purification of the carbon matrices. With the incorporation of metal nanoparticles, the generated peaks on the Cat-KOH showed sharper spikes with heightened intensities as compared to its HNO3 and NH4OH/H2O2 counterparts; suggesting a more crystalline metal phases on the former catalyst. It could also be reasoned that homogeneity of metal species deposited on the HNO3 treated supported catalyst was superior as compared to the remaining catalysts investigated. This could be attributed to relatively lower surface area (268m2/g) of Cat-KOH as opposed to the higher surface area (375m2/g) of Cat-HNO3. It is worth mentioning that a catalyst support with more desirable textural properties would better enhance the stabilization the active species and promoters as well as playing a vital role to modify the dispersion, reducibility, and electron-donating or accepting effects of metal nanoparticles [33]. Consequently, the relatively higher surface area of the HNO3-treated OMC support may have played a significant role by enhancing great dispersion of catalytic phases as confirmed by the XRD profile for its corresponding catalyst. Also, the peaks occurring at 2θ values of 26.2, 28.3 and 34.8 can be assigned to the presence of K2Mo2O7 species in the samples [34]. The average MoO3 crystallite size from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) diffraction profile computed by the Debye-Scherer’s equation (L=0.9λ/βcosθ) for the chemically treated OMC catalysts showed MoO3 crystallite size in the range 6–9nm as opposed to 12nm for the untreated supported catalyst. Nonetheless, both particle sizes quite favored the higher alcohols synthesis reaction. However, it should be noted that these nanoparticles are liable to significant changes during higher alcohol synthesis reaction as a result of time on stream under operation conditions of pressure and temperature. 3.1.4 Raman spectroscopic analysis Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool for identifying carbon materials and detecting heteroatoms present in carbon matrix [35–39]. It is a nondestructive vibrational technique and particularly well suited to detect small changes in structural morphology of carbon nanomaterials [40,41]. Every band occurring in the Raman spectrum corresponds directly to a specific vibrational frequency of a bond within the molecules of the specimen investigated [42,43]. For carbon materials such as graphite, carbon nanotubes, ordered mesoporous carbons, etc., information such as electronic structure as well as sample imperfections can be derived from spectra obtained from this technique [44]. Fig. 4 A & B, shows characteristics vibrational profiles of both treated and untreated OMC supports as well as their corresponding KCoMoRh catalysts as ascertained by Raman spectroscopic studies. Raman spectra evidenced two distinct peaks in the range of 1340–1365cm−1 and 1575–1600cm−1, and can be attributed to the so called D- and G-bands, respectively. The former is characteristic of the extent of disorderliness in the carbon matrix and the latter is due to the CC stretching modes present in the material. While the G-band indicates the graphitic E2g plane vibration, the D-band is due to the disordered parts such as grain boundaries [45,24], which is indicative of the A1g plane. It is known that the intensity ratio of the D–G bands (ID/IG) is generally used to denote the extent of disorderliness present in the graphite layer of carbon material. The greater the value of this parameter, the more disordered the material becomes [46]. For instance, using the ratio of peak intensities (ID/IG), the level of disorder in the Raman spectra of graphene was characterized by Lucchese et al. [47]. The authors observed that as the extent of disorder in the graphene material increased, ID/IG displays two different behaviors: a regime of “low” defect density, where ID/IG ratio increases and a regime of “high” defect density, where ID/IG ratio decreases. The former is as a result of higher defect density creating more elastic scattering; and the latter can be a result of an increasing defect density resulting in a more amorphous carbon structure [47]. These two regimes are referred to as “nanocrystalline graphite” and “mainly sp2 amorphous carbon” phases, respectively [47–51]. As can be noted in Fig. 4A, apart from the band position of the HNO3-treated support, which appears to be shifted towards the right (a Raman shift from 1340 to 1366cm−1), the D-bands for all others can be located at the same position; suggesting that chemical treatment of the OMC support with HNO3 might have caused more defective sites as compared to its NH4OH/H2O2 and KOH counterparts. The respective ID/IG ratios for the untreated and chemically treated supports followed the order: NH4OH/H2O2 (0.76)>HNO3 (0.73)>KOH (0.65)>Pristine OMC (0.61); however, the corresponding trends for the supported catalysts is as follows: Cat-UnOMC (0.77)>Cat-KOH (0.68)>Cat-NH4OH/H2O2 (0.59)>Cat-HNO3 (0.57). It can also be deduced that the ID/IG ratios of the respective chemically treated supports and their corresponding catalysts decreased. For instance, following the various chemical treatments, the ID/IG ratios changes as follows: NH4OH/H2O2 (0.76–0.59), HNO3 (0.73–0.57), KOH (0.65–0.68) and UnOMC (0.61–0.77). This observed trend can be explained by the fact that initial chemical treatment by NH4OH/H2O2 and HNO3 modified the surface chemistry of the OMC support and created the needed defective sites (“high” defect density) via oxygen-functional groups anchorage. The incorporation of metal precursors via co-impregnation on to these chemical treated supports and subsequent catalyst calcination caused a shift from a regime of “high” defect density to that of “low” defect density, characterized by a decrease in ID/IG ratio as evidenced in a similar study conducted by Lucchese et al. [47]. Similarly, the increase in ID/IG ratio as observed in KOH (0.65–0.68) and UnOMC (0.61–0.77) can be due to the vigorous treatment resulting from KOH functionalization and the direct one-step calcination of Cat-UnOMC; probably suggesting creation of more amorphous carbon in the Cat-KOH and Cat-UnOMC catalyst materials. As can be seen in Fig. 4B, other peaks located at 261, 540, 789, 904, 967, and 1080 can be attributed to metal-oxygen species formation in the catalysts studied, probably of the forms; OMoO, KMoO, and CoMoO, bonds. One can conclude from the present work that not only did the chemical oxidation treatment of the OMC support cause the generation of defective sites, but also the direct metal precursor impregnation on to the support (without chemical pre-treatment) and the concomitant one-step calcination can also contribute to the creation of defective sites as corroborated by Raman analysis. 3.1.5 Fourier Transform Infra-red analysis The FTIR technique was employed to analyze the surface functional groups present on all the carbon materials studied. The resulting spectra of samples are shown in Fig. 5 A & B. The spectrum of the pristine OMC carbon support shows bands related to oxygen and carbon groups, located at 3450 and 1615cm−1, respectively. The peak at 3450cm−1 is due the stretching vibration of OH groups in the material, indicating the oscillation of carboxyl groups [52]. This peak can also be seen in the chemically treated supports; however, it becomes more prominent for the HNO3 treated support. The other peak located at 1615cm−1 as observed for the pristine OMC support can be attributed to the stretching skeletal vibration of CC (polynuclear aromatic structure) bond [53], which could also been seen in all the supports. For the treated supports, additional distinct peaks located at 1245 and 1720cm−1 were observed on the spectrum of the HNO3 treated support. The band at 1245cm−1 can be assigned to contributions from stretching COC vibrations (in ether and lactone structures or other single bonded oxo-group, COR) and that observed at 1720cm−1 can be assigned to CO stretching vibrations from carbonyl or carboxyl groups, respectively [13]. It is noteworthy to mention that these carboxylic groups can be generated due to the oxidation of some carbon atoms on the surface of the OMC support as a result of the chemical pretreatment [24]. Furthermore, two more prominent peaks occurring at 1350 and 1535cm−1 on the same HNO3 spectrum can be assigned to stretching vibrations (asymmetric and symmetric, respectively) of nitro group (NO2), indicating the simultaneous occurrence of nitration reactions during the intended HNO3 chemical oxidation treatment [53]. These peaks were absent in the NH4OH/H2O2 and KOH treated supports; suggesting that the chemical composition of the carbon network in the OMC support is changed considerably during oxidation with nitric acid. In Fig. 5B, it can be observed that most of the peaks disappeared due to their consumption in metal-oxygen bond formation, following metal precursor impregnation and subsequent calcination in N2 atmosphere. All catalysts showed peaks at 866 and 969cm−1, which could be ascribed to out-of-plane deformation of C-H bonds [13,53], possibly via the formation of metal species moiety. 3.1.6 Thermogravimetric analysis The percent weight loss of the supports and catalyst samples as a function of temperature were ascertained by TGA technique so as to determine the thermal stability of the impregnated catalysts during the HAS reaction. Fig. 6 A and B shows the TGA profiles for the supports and catalysts, respectively. It shows that prior to chemical oxidation, the pristine OMC support did not have much oxygen-containing functional groups; indicated by the fairly stable thermal characteristics as depicted by its profile. However, after chemical oxidation of the pristine support, the thermogravimetric (TG) profiles of the chemically treated supports (especially, HNO3 and NH4OH/H2O2) evidenced significant changes in their respective profiles; suggesting the incorporation of functional groups during the pretreatment step. Typically, the existence of surface functional groups can be confirmed due to the significant mass loss during the controlled heat treatment experiment. Thus, an increase in the mass loss during the TG analysis can be correlated to an increased amount of functional groups present on the carbon surfaces by the oxidation treatment. This is consistent with the results from FTIR spectroscopy in which chemical treatment resulted in the appearance of more distinct peaks for example the HNO3 treated support. In addition, during the TG analysis, thermal degradation of the surface functional groups occurs in the chemically oxidized samples. The evolved gaseous species is quantifiable if TG setup is equipped with mass spectrometer (MS). For instance, within the range of temperature for the TG analysis (150–700°C) for typical carbon materials, a significant amount of CO2 (resulting from the decomposition of carboxyl groups) together with other compounds such as methane, butane and butanol (resulting from the decomposition of the carbon framework) have observed in the MS traces [13]. At low-temperature, CO2 evolution may be the result of carboxyl groups decomposition; however, at high-temperature, the decomposition of anhydride and lactone groups have been reported [54]. Moreover, whereas CO2 evolution mostly occurs below 500°C and CO evolution proceeding above this temperature, both physisorbed and chemisorbed water are mostly released in the range of 100–450°C [55,56]. However, in the present work, quantitative evaluation of the corresponding evolved gaseous species was not determined. Nonetheless, the corresponding % mass loss for the supports investigated in the temperature range of 200–500°C followed the trend: HNO3 (32.4%)>Pristine OMC (7.9%)>NH4OH/H2O2 (1.1%)>KOH (0.1%) For the supported catalysts, it is clear from profiles in Fig. 6B that a similar weight loss pattern was observed for all chemically treated catalysts. That notwithstanding, the untreated-supported KCoRhMo catalyst (Cat-UnOMC) exhibited quite a stable thermal property as compared to its HNO3 counterparts; thus, would still survive the practical reaction conditions though it was not chemically pretreated. It also deserves mentioning that Cat-HNO3 is thermally stable up to 400°C after which temperature it undergoes significant rapid weight loss as a function of increasing temperature. However, since the actual HAS reaction does not go beyond 400°C, it should be within reasonable error margin. Thus, the trend observed for weight loss in the temperature range of 200–500°C for the catalysts is as follows: Cat-HNO3 (16.3%)>Cat-UnOMC (7.1%)>Cat-NH4OH/H2O2 (2.7%)>Cat-KOH (1.2%). One could deduce from these trends and Fig. 6A & B that the rapid weight loss as a function of temperature for the HNO3-treated support and its supported catalysts suggests a form of decomposition of chemical species in this material as temperature gradually increased; resulting in the generation of their unique defective sites that favored the HAS reaction. As shown in Table 1, the decreases in the specific surface areas and pore volumes associated with catalysts preparation from their respective supports are in the range of 35–45% and 31–46%, respectively. This reduction is due to the increased additional mass after metal precursors co-impregnation, as corroborated by the TG measurements. TG analyses (Fig. 6A & B) showed that above 400°C, some of the oxidized catalyst samples exhibited higher mass loss; thus, providing useful information regarding the thermal stability of the investigated catalysts for a typical HAS reaction. 3.1.7 Temperature programmed reduction analysis Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was used to study the reducibility of metal species in the catalyst formulation using hydrogen gas as the probe gas. H2-TPR profiles for the supported catalysts are presented in Fig. 7 . All four catalysts evidenced the typical hydrogen consumption peaks corresponding to the reduction of octahedrally coordinated MoO3 species (Mo6+) to the tetrahedrally coordinated MoO2 species (Mo4+) [23,57], which undergo further reduction to lower oxidation state molybdate moieties at high temperature. In the case of the untreated supported KCoRhMo catalyst (Cat-UnOMC), three main peaks were observed to occur at 135°C, 395°C and 593°C, respectively. The mid-range reduction temperature peak (395°C) is as a result of bulk MoO3 species present in the oxidic catalyst undergoing reduction in the presence of hydrogen to generate its tetrahedrally coordinated forms (Mo4+), which are subsequently completely reduced to lower oxidation states. The absence of a peak occurring in the range 340–360°C could also be noted; suggesting the sufficient reduction of bulk CoO3 species in the catalyst, giving indication of the probable formation of the Co-Mo-O phase which is active for the higher alcohol synthesis reaction. This observation is consistent with a previous study conducted by Surisetty et al. [23] on a similar catalyst matrix supported on both activated carbon and MWCNT. One could also observe a small peak appearing around the region of 135°C from the TPR profile of Cat-UnOMC; which could be attributed to the reduction of rhodium species (Rh+1) to its metallic forms (Rh0). A similar observation has been reported in the literature [23]. For the treated supported catalysts, similar peaks were observed to occur in the lower (<200°C), middle (295–395°C), and higher (>400°C) temperature ranges, corresponding to the reduction of species as discussed for Cat-UnOMC above. However, the positions of these peaks varied significantly with the various chemical treatments. As compared to Cat-UnOMC, the occurrence of a reduction peaks around 135°C for the treated supported catalysts suggests the complete reduction of Rh+1 to Rh0 species in these samples. Similarly, it could also be seen from Fig. 7 that the reduction of octahedrally coordinated MoO3 species to its tetrahedrally coordinated forms occurred around 298°C for the treated supported catalysts, which is about 100°C lower than that observed for Cat-UnOMC. That notwithstanding, it should be noted that Co3O4 species have the same reduction temperature so there exist the possibility that the H2 consumption peak is an overlap contribution of multiple peaks corresponding to the reduction of MoO3 and Co3O4 species. In addition, the total area under the peaks spanning the overall temperature reduction regime is greater for Cat-HNO3 suggesting higher H2 uptake for this catalyst. This observation underscores the significance of chemical pre-treatment of the support prior to metal precursor impregnation for the carbon-supported. In the case of reduction of Mo4+ species to lower oxidation state oxo-molybdate species, which occurred at higher reduction temperatures, the observed increasing trend for the chemically treated supported catalysts followed the order: Cat-HNO3 (485°C)<Cat-NH4OH/H2O2 (498°C)<Cat-KOH (525°C)<Cat-UnOMC (593°C). This trend can be explained by the fact that Cat-HNO3 possesses the highest surface area as compared to its counterparts; thus, dispersed metal species can adequately interact with the support, thereby improving their reducibility and subsequent dispersion in the catalyst matrix as corroborated by XRD analysis. 3.1.8 Transmission electron microscopic analysis The TEM images of untreated and chemically treated OMC supported catalysts were recorded and are presented in Fig. 8 . The periodic ordering of pores with well-defined pore structure of these materials can be seen from the TEM images. The distribution of catalyst particles are quite observable in the samples as well, showing well dispersed catalysts inside the pores and also on the exterior surfaces of the carbon materials. It can also be seen that catalyst particles appear as aggregates or nanoclusters dispersed on the untreated OMC supported catalysts, most likely on the surface of the material. In addition, the existence of tubule-like features in the carbon matrix is also evident in the carbon samples of Cat-UnOMC and can probably be due to the presence of impurities in this sample, which were not removed during the chemical pretreatment step. This feature was absent in the chemically treated samples. For Cat-HNO3 and Cat-NH4OH/H2O2, despite the occurrence of well dispersed catalyst nanoparticles, the structure of the parent OMC material is also kept intact; providing evidence that treatment of the pristine OMC support with HNO3 and NH4OH/H2O2 did not have a detrimental effect on its morphology. Nonetheless, a slight change in the morphology of the OMC material can be observed for the supported catalyst treated with KOH, which appears slightly distorted; suggesting the original structure of the OMC is not preserved, probably due to the oxidative attack on the carbon matrix during this chemical treatment. The particle sizes of the metal species averaged over difference locations in these samples are in the range of 7–9nm for the treated catalysts and 12nm for the untreated supported catalyst."
9,Catalytic performance tests of OMC-supported KCoMoRh catalysts,"3.2 Catalytic performance tests of OMC-supported KCoMoRh catalysts The prepared catalyst samples (Cats-A–D) were screened for their performance in the HAS reaction in a high-pressure fixed-bed micro reactor using syngas as feedstock under similar conditions of pressure, temperature, H2:CO, and GHSV of 8.3MPa, 300–340°C, 1.25, and 3.6m3 (STP)/kgcat h, respectively. The metals loading intended for the formulation of these catalyst samples were maintained the same to help study the influence of chemical pre-treatment of the OMC support on higher alcohols productivity. 3.2.1 Effect of chemical pretreatment of OMC supports on CO Conversion For the CO hydrogenation reaction, the catalytic activities of the MoS2-supported catalysts are mostly at their peak performance at the onset of reaction and gradually decline as result of time-on-stream. As shown in Fig. 9 , within the last 12h of the 24h period, CO conversion recorded for all catalysts declined and then stabilized after 18h on stream due to the well-known phenomenon of initial pre-coking step MoS2-based catalysts undergo prior to attaining stable catalytic activity [23–25,28]. It can be seen from Fig. 9 that all catalysts did not show any significant deactivation after 18h reaction time online. Nonetheless, at the same experimental conditions, one can observe a higher CO conversion for Cat-HNO3 as compared to its treated counterparts; probably due to its better textural properties following the chemical oxidative treatment. Thus, at the same metals loading (9%K, 4.5%Co, 15%Mo & 1.5%Rh), there exists relatively more active metal species on this catalyst as can be corroborated by the CO uptake analyses of these catalysts (Table 2). The amount of CO uptake (μmol/g) followed the trend: Cat-HNO3 (37)>Cat-NH4OH/H2O2 (30)>Cat-UnOMC (25)>Cat-KOH (16), which gives indication that more active sites were present on Cat-HNO3 for the HAS reaction as opposed to Cat-KOH. Moreover, the higher surface area of Cat-HNO3 may have greatly enhanced the uniform distribution of the dispersed metal species as confirmed by XRD analysis. Furthermore, the less desirable textural properties of Cat-KOH may be responsible for its rather reduced catalytic activity as compared to its counterparts. 3.2.2 Effects of chemical treatment on alcohol products distribution The prepared oxidic form of the KCoRhMo-supported catalysts were evaluated using a high-pressure fixed-bed downward flow reactor system for catalysts screening so as to ascertain their catalytic performance in the HAS reaction. The syngas of molar composition of 50%H2:40%CO:10%Ar was used as the feedstock. Typical reaction conditions evaluated include pressure, temperature, and GHSV of 8.3MPa, 300–340°C, and 3.6m3 (STP)/kgcat.h, respectively. Prior to the onset of the higher alcohol synthesis reaction, an initial catalyst activation step was necessary in order to ensure the phase conversion of the rather less active oxidic catalytic species into a more active sulfidic form. This was achieved by subjecting catalysts to an initial sulfidation/reduction step using a sulfiding gas mixture of 10%H2S/H2 molar compositions [24]. With the intended metals loading maintained constant for all four catalyst formulations, the influence of chemical pretreatment of the supports on the higher alcohols productivity was investigated. The extent of alcohol products distribution is crucial and depends on the nature of supports (treated or untreated) employed for the HAS reaction, since treatment of the support directly influences its surface chemistry; thus, affecting interaction of catalyst nanoparticles with the support and their capabilities of facilitating the dispersion of active metal species in the support matrix. In this regards, the influence of supports pretreatment on alcohol products distribution has been presented in Fig. 10 . It is quite obvious that alcohol products stream generated by all OMC-supported KCoRhMo catalysts constituted mostly of linear alcohols with carbon numbers in the range of C1–C5. All the supported catalyst systems enhanced the production of these alcohols, mostly C2 alcohols, with selectivities of 44.1, 42.8, & 35.1% for Cat-HNO3, Cat-NH4OH/H2O2 and Cat-KOH, respectively. However, for the untreated-supported catalyst (Cat-UnOMC), methanol was the predominant alcohol formed, with selectivity of about 49.2%. Products selectivities for the gaseous and liquid streams of the CO hydrogenation reaction are summarized for all catalysts investigated and are presented in Table 3 . As can be seen, Cat-UnOMC and Cat-KOH tend to produce more CO2; suggesting their higher activity for the water-gas-shift reaction. Thus, from Fig. 10 and Table 3, it becomes quite conclusive that all the supported KCoRhMoS2 catalysts investigated for higher alcohol productivity turned out to have high selectivity towards the production of higher alcohols, with ethanol being the most predominant higher alcohol product in the final liquid product stream with the by-products comprising mainly CO2 and light hydrocarbons (methane and ethane). 3.2.3 Effects of temperature on alcohol products distribution Temperature control is a crucial parameter that plays a significant role in all chemical reactions including CO hydrogenation reactions. Due to the exothermic nature of the HAS reaction, CO conversion and hence alcohol productivity during the reaction becomes quite temperature-dependent. That notwithstanding, it should be noted that excessively high operating temperatures may lead to rapid loss of activity and shortening of catalyst life due to an accelerated catalyst deactivation by sintering of nanocrystallite metal particles into larger less active phases [58]. Moreover, there also exists a high tendency of enhancing side reactions such as methanation reaction, leading to coke formation, which is mostly favored at high temperatures [9]. In Fig. 11 , alcohol productivity as a function of temperature for the four catalysts studied is presented. As can be seen from this figure, apart from Cat-HNO3 which showed total alcohol produced at a slightly higher temperature (330°C), all the other catalysts evidenced total alcohols produced at low temperature (300°C). As temperature increased from 300 to 320°C, all catalysts showed a decline in total alcohol productivity, which then stabilized for Cat-UnOMC and Cat-NH4OH/H2O2 as temperature further increased from 320 to 340°C. Alcohol productivity continued to decline for Cat-KOH with a temperature rise of 10°C in the first segment (320–330°C) and then increased slightly in the final segment (330–340°C). On the other hand, increasing temperature slightly increased alcohol productivity for Cat-HNO3, which eventually became stable as temperature further increased from 330 to 340°C. Furthermore, apart from Cat-UnOMC that showed a marginally higher C2+ alcohol productivity at 300°C, Cat-HNO3 appears to dominate C2+ alcohol productivity at all temperatures, with maximum alcohol productivity recorded at 330°C. At this temperature, the trend of C2+ alcohols produced followed the order: Cat-HNO3 (63.7)>Cat-NH4OH/H2O2 (48.9)>Cat-UnOMC (38.2)>Cat-KOH (36.8). Quite interestingly, the untreated pristine supported catalyst showed better alcohol productivity at all levels of temperature studied as compared to its KOH treated counterpart, suggesting that for the OMC support the kind of chemical oxidative treatment is not always advantageous and might adversely affect catalyst activity. Nonetheless, for all catalysts evaluated at the various temperatures, the main by-products observed for the CO hydrogenation reactions included carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons (mainly methane and ethane). These by-products tend to be more favorable at higher temperatures for these KCoRhMo catalysts studied. 3.2.4 Alcohol products distribution and the ASF Plots The term higher alcohols (C2+OH) is used to describe alcohols with carbon numbers greater than 1; thus, total alcohols constitutes a combination of C1, C2 as well as all C2+ alcohols put together. In the formation of C2+ alcohols over Mo-based catalyst, a generally accepted mechanism is the CO insertion [9,59], in which syngas reactant species (CO and H2) associatively or dissociatively adsorb onto the catalyst’s active sites; yielding adsorbed formyl (HCO) and alkyl (CHx) species. Consequently, hydrogenation of the former species can proceed to produce methanol (CH3OH) via reaction of adsorbed H species with the carbonyl group. Conversely, the insertion of adsorbed CO into the surface alkyl bond can also occur to yield adsorb acetyl species (COCHx), which can further undergo hydrogenation to form ethanol (C2H5OH). Furthermore, this chain propagation mechanism can continue with the insertion of CO into surface alkyl species of high carbon numbers and their subsequent hydrogenation to yield corresponding high carbon number alcohols [60,61]. During this chain surface polymerization HAS reaction, the selectivities of various alcohols can be depicted from the chain-growth probability (α) and carbon number (n) by the well-known Anderson-Shultz-Flory (ASF) model, represented as [58,62]: lnW n = nln α + ln ( 1 − α ) 2 α where Wn is the weight percent of a product containing n carbon atoms and α is the chain growth probability. The higher the value of α, the longer the alcohol carbon chain length is [63]. Fig. 12 depicts the ASF plots for the OMC-supported KCoRhMo catalysts investigated for the HAS reaction. Similarly, Fig. 13 compares these plots for the various treatments and their respective alcohol products distribution for all catalyst. It can be seen that alcohols products distribution for the various carbon numbers is consistent with the linear trend predicted by the ASF model; however, a deviation can be observed in the formation of methanol and pentanol for all catalysts as evidenced by the cluster of outliers as shown in Fig. 13. Evaluation of the chain-growth probability from the slopes of the linear ASF plots (Fig. 12) yielded α values following the order: Cat-HNO3 (0.26)>Cat-NH4OH/H2O2 (0.22)≈Cat-UnOMC (0.22)>Cat-KOH (0.19); indicative of the fact that the classical CO insertion phenomenon might have governed the mechanism of HAS reaction over all the catalysts studied. Moreover, it appears the chemically treated catalysts showed a stronger CO insertion phenomenon as compared to its untreated counterpart (Cat-UnOMC) due to the higher chain-growth probability of C2–C4 over former catalysts (0.22–0.26) as opposed to the latter (0.19)."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, large pore diameter OMC supports were synthesized by the soft-templating approach, chemically treated in acidic or basic medium, and employed in the formulation of K-doped CoRhMoS2 catalysts for HAS applications. The wet chemical oxidation treatment modified the surface chemistry of the ordered mesoporous carbon materials and introduced oxygen-containing functional groups on the carbon frameworks, which can be used for metals anchorage via covalent bonding. At similar metals loading, BET analysis of all catalysts evidenced significant structural mesoporosity and orderliness since the physical properties of the materials were not compromised; however, a lesser pore blockage was observed in Cat-HNO3 as confirmed by the NSBET computations. Moreover, at similar metals loadings of 9%K, 4.5%Co, 15%Mo and 1.5wt.% Rh, XRD analysis evidenced a better metal nanoparticles dispersion on Cat-HNO3 since less crystalline peaks were detected as confirmed by the TEM images. Chemical treatment of OMC support with nitric acid caused more defective sites with lower metals reducibility temperature as compared to its NH4OH/H2O2 and KOH counterparts as confirmed by Raman and TPR analyses; thus, its superior catalytic performance for the HAS reaction. Nonetheless, all the chemically treated OMC-supported catalysts exhibited high activities toward the production of alcohols, especially ethanol. Quite interestingly, the untreated pristine supported catalyst showed better total alcohol productivity at all levels of temperature studied as compared to its KOH treated counterpart, suggesting that for the OMC support the kind of chemical oxidative treatment is not always advantageous and might adversely affect catalyst activity. At the optimum temperature 330°C, linear alcohols were produced and followed the ASF distribution; with the trend of C2+ alcohols selectivities following the order: Cat-HNO3 (63.7)>Cat-NH4OH/H2O2 (48.9)>Cat-UnOMC (38.2)>Cat-KOH (36.8). The results of this study elucidate the crucial role of chemical oxidation as a preconditioning step prior to carbon-supported catalysts preparation and their application for chemical reactions."
