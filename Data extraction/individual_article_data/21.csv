0,Introduction,"CO2 hydrogenation to fuels and chemicals is considered to be an effective way to reduce the dependency on dwindling fossil fuels and help cut increasing CO2 emissions [1–6]. Among the products, higher alcohols (C2+OH) stand out owing to its potential application as fuel additives and intermediates for fine chemicals. Significant advances have been made in the higher alcohols synthesis (HAS) from CO2 hydrogenation through rational design of catalysts and reaction system [7–12]. Given the complex parallel and consecutive reactions and higher energy barriers for alcohol synthesis, directly converting CO2 into higher alcohols with high yield remains a major challenge yet [13]. CO-mediating mechanism is widely accepted for HAS from CO2 hydrogenation, which can be described as a combination of reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) to produce CO and subsequent CO insertion to alkyl species from CO dissociation [14,15]. Hence the catalysts applied to HAS need to simultaneously catalyze CO2 activation, carbon chain growth and CO insertion. A great balance between dissociative and non-dissociative CO activation is also required to provide matched molecularly adsorbed CO and alkyl species for HAS, and the mismatching of these processes would result in low activity and low selectivity [16]. Owing to the complex requirements, most of the researches centered on catalysts with two or more active metals to provide catalytic sites with different functionality [17–20]. And an intimate interaction between the metals during reaction is vital to achieve effective and stable synergy for selective synthesis. To avoid the deactivation caused by phase separation, catalysts containing a single active metal have attracted much attention. Ding et al. proposed a novel Cu@Na-Beta catalyst with entrapped small copper particles in zeolite, achieving a superior ethanol yield in CO2 hydrogenation [21]. The Co-based catalyst with synergy of Co0 and CoC x species in CO activation make it another choice for HAS [22–25]. Iron is a well-known candidate catalyst for CO2 conversion due to its non-noble feature and high activity in RWGS and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) [26–29]. Generally, Fe is perceived to be an active component for catalyzing CO dissociation, and mainly contributes to the formation of hydrocarbon products [30–33]. Among the ever-reported iron-containing catalysts for HAS, a combination with noble metals (such as Pd, Rh) or Cu is usually needed to enhance the CO insertion step to match the alkyl species generated on Fe sites [34–38]. Selective synthesis of higher alcohols on monometallic iron catalysts is considered to be quite difficult to achieve, and it has not been reported yet. Herein, a monometallic Fe catalyst with synergistic combination of Na and S (FeNaS-0.6) was proposed for selective conversion of CO2 to higher alcohols. The sulfur in the form of sulfate (SO4 2−) can tailor the CO activation and help to provide more molecularly adsorbed CO to match the alkyl species generated on Na-assisted Fe sites, aiding the formation of higher alcohols."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The FeNaS catalysts were prepared via simple precipitation/washing method using Fe2(SO4)3 as the iron source and NaOH as the precipitating agent and the source of alkali promoter. Typically, Fe2(SO4)3·xH2O was dissolved in a mixture of 150 mL of deionized water and 0.8 mL of 18.4 mol L−1 H2SO4. Then, 1.5 mol L−1 NaOH was added dropwise with constant stirring at 60 °C until pH of the suspension reached 10. After aging for 1 h at 60 °C, the product was separated by centrifugation, washed with certain amount of deionized water, dried at 80 °C for 12 h, and calcined at 400 °C for 2 h. The FeNaS-x (x = 0.03, 0.1, 0.6, 3.0) catalysts were obtained via washing with different amount of deionized water, and the x represents the weight percentage of sulfur (wt%). The FeNa catalyst was obtained via same method as FeNaS, expect for using Fe(NO3)3·9H2O as iron source and HNO3 as substitute for H2SO4. The content of Na in FeNa was controlled to be similar to FeNaS-0.6. The FeS catalyst was obtained using Fe2(SO4)3 as iron source and NH3·H2O as precipitating agent, and the S content was controlled to be similar to FeNaS-0.6. The pure iron catalyst named Fe was prepared with Fe(NO3)3·9H2O as iron source and NH3·H2O as precipitating agent. The moles of Fe3+ and H+ applied in preparation are equal among these catalysts. The FeNaS-im catalyst was obtained via impregnating sodium sulfate on FeNa and followed calcination at 400 °C for 2 h. The contents of Na and S in the studied catalysts are given in Table S1."
3,Catalytic test,"2.2 Catalytic test The CO2 hydrogenation reaction was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor with the condition of 320 °C, 3.0 MPa and GHSV =8000 mL gcat −1 h−1. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was reduced in situ in H2 flow under atmospheric pressure at 350 °C for 8 h. The reactor was cooled down to 280 °C after the pre-reduction, and the reactant gas (H2/CO2/N2 = 72/24/4) was introduced to increase the pressure to 3.0 MPa. Then the system temperature was increased to 320 °C and maintained during the reaction process. The organic products were analyzed using an online gas chromatographs (GC) system (Agilent 7890B) equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) and PONA capillary column, and the outlet gas (N2, CO, CH4 and CO2) was analyzed using another GC system (GC-2014AT, SHIMADZU). The gas sampling lines between the reactor and GC were heated to 160 °C to avoid product condensation, and a cold trap was placed before the inlet of TCD to collect water and heavy products."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The phase composition of the catalysts was identified by X-ray power diffraction (XRD) on a PANAlytical X’Pert Pro diffractometer with Cu-Kα (60 kV, 55 mA) radiation. The contents of Na and S in catalysts were detected by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, PerkinElmer 7300DV). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a TECNAI G2 F20 system with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The HAADF and element mapping images were obtained on FEI Talos 200 F system. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI spectrometer with Al Kα radiation. The binding energies were calibrated by the C1 s peak at 284.8 eV. The spectra at different depths were obtained by sputtering with 2 kV Ar+ for different time. N2 adsorption-desorption measurements were obtained at −196 °C on a QuantaChrome Quadrasorb SI instrument, and the specific surface areas were determined by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The samples were outgassed at 300 °C for 5 h under vacuum before measurements. 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy (MES) was performed under room temperature using Topologic 500A spectrometer, with 57Co (Rh) moving in a constant acceleration mode as the radioactive source. H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was carried out on Micromeritics AutoChem 2910 apparatus. Prior to the reduction, the sample was pretreated at 300 °C for 30 min under Ar flow. After cooling down to ambient temperature, the gas was switched to 10 % H2/Ar and the sample was heated to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min, during which the H2 consumption was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector. CO2-temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) was performed on Micromeritics AutoChem 2910 apparatus. Prior to the adsorption, the sample was pre-reduced in H2 stream at 350 °C for 3 h. After cooling down to 50 °C, the sample was exposed to a CO2 flow for 30 min for saturated adsorption, and then purged with flowing He gas until the baseline was steady. Subsequently, the CO2 desorption was carried out from 50 °C to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min in He stream. The CO2 (m/z = 44) and CO (m/z = 28) signals during the desorption process were recorded by mass spectrometer. CO pre-adsorption and H2-temperature programmed surface reaction (H2-TPSR) was carried out on an automated chemisorption analyzer (FINESORB30100). The sample was pre-reduced at 350 °C for 3 h in H2 stream and cooled to 50 °C. Then the sample was exposed to 5 % CO/Ar flow for 30 min for saturated adsorption, and flushed with Ar until the baseline was steady. Finally, the feed gas was switched to 5 % H2/Ar and the reaction was carried out from 50 °C to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The CO (m/z = 28) and H2 signals (m/z = 2) during this process was recorded by a Pfeiffer OmniStar mass spectrometer. In situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was performed on a spectrometer (Bruker, TENSOR_II) equipped with an in situ cell. The sample was in situ reduced in a flow of 10 % H2/Ar at 350 °C for 1 h and then flushed by pure Ar for 1 h. The temperature of the in situ cell was cooled down to 320 °C and the background spectrum was collected then. Subsequently, the feed gas (H2/CO2/Ar = 7.5/2.5/90) was introduced at 320 °C for 60 min under atmospheric pressure, and then the gas flow was switched to 10 % H2/Ar."
5,DFT calculation,"2.4 DFT calculation All calculations were performed using the plane wave based periodic DFT method as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) [39]. The electron-ion interaction was described with the projector augmented wave (PAW) method [40]. The electron exchange and correlation energies were treated within the generalized gradient approximation in the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional (GGA-PBE). The plane wave basis was set up to 500 eV. The adsorption energy was calculated according to Eads = EX/slab – [Eslab + EX], where EX/slab is the total energy of the slab with adsorbates in its equilibrium geometry, Eslab is the total energy of the bare slab, and EX is the total energy of the free adsorbates in the gas phase. Therefore, the more negative the Eads, the stronger the adsorption. The barrier (Ea) and reaction energy (Er) are calculated according to Ea = GTS – GFS where GIS, and GFS are the Gibbs free energies of the corresponding initial state (IS) and final state (FS) at 300 K, respectively. Gibbs free energies for different adsorption states were calculated as below (here taking CO adsorbing on the substrate for example, named as sub_CO): G(sub_CO) = H(sub_CO) – T × S(sub_CO) H(sub_CO) = EDFT(sub_CO) + EZPE(sub_CO) + EH(sub_CO) Where H(sub_CO) is the thermodynamically corrected enthalpy of sub_CO (eV), S(sub_CO) is the entropy of sub_CO (eV K−1), EDFT(sub_CO) is the static electron energy of sub_CO (eV), EZPE(sub_CO) is the zero point energy of sub_CO (eV), EH(sub_CO) is the enthalpy contribution of sub_CO (eV), and T is the temperature (K)."

7,Higher alcohols synthesis over iron catalyst with Na and S modification,"3.1 Higher alcohols synthesis over iron catalyst with Na and S modification The XRD pattern of FeNaS-0.6 mainly exhibits diffraction peaks belonging to α–Fe2O3 phase (Fig. 1 a), and no diffraction peak related to sulfur and sodium compound is observed due to the lower contents. A single peak with binding energy at 168.5 eV (Fig. 1b) was observed in the S 2p spectrum of spent FeNaS-0.6 catalyst, indicating the sulfur was always in the form of sulfate (SO4 2−) during the reaction [41]. No obvious S 2p peak appeared for the fresh one, which should be relevant to the much lower sulfur content (0.6 wt%). The surface layers of FeNaS-0.6 catalyst at different depths were further detected by XPS. The surface S/Fe atomic ratio of FeNaS-0.6 increased significantly after reaction, meanwhile, the ratio decreased from 13.4 % to 5.3 % with the increase of etching depth (0→10 nm) for the spent catalyst, implying that sulfate enrichment occurred on the catalyst surface during CO2 hydrogenation process (Fig. S1). This also explained the more obvious S 2p peak for spent one. The reference catalyst FeNa, whose content of Na (2.5 wt%) is similar to that of FeNaS-0.6 (2.4 wt%), is characterized to be α–Fe2O3 as well by XRD and TEM (Fig. S2). The catalytic performance of FeNaS-0.6 and FeNa catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation was evaluated at 320 °C, 3.0 MPa (Fig. 2 a and Table S2). The FeNa catalyst showed favored formation of long-chain hydrocarbons and the selectivity to C2+OH was less than 5 % (exclude CO). Comparatively, the selectivity to alcohols reached 16.1 % with a CO2 conversion of 32.0 % over FeNaS-0.6 catalyst, and the fraction of C2+OH in total alcohols was more than 98 %, demonstrating an obvious advantage in alcohol synthesis. In view of the same initial phase composition, we speculated that the introduction of sulfate is probably relevant to the HAS performance. Then the catalytic performance of FeNaS-x (x = 0.03, 0.1, 0.6, 3.0) catalysts was evaluated to investigate the influence of sulfur content (Fig. 2b). The CO2 conversion over FeNaS-x decreased with the increase of sulfur content, along with increased CO selectivity, suggesting the increased sulfur content could inhibit CO2 activation and further conversion of CO generated from RWGS reaction. Meanwhile, a volcano-shaped relationship between C2+OH selectivity and sulfur content was observed, pointing out the significance of introduced sulfur content in alcohol synthesis. In addition, the space-time yield (STY) of C2+OH on FeNaS-0.6 was up to 78.5 mg gcat −1 h−1 (total alcohols of 80.5 mg gcat −1 h−1) at a relatively mild operating pressure, ranking high among the ever-reported iron-containing catalysts (such as FeCu, RhFe) in HAS from CO2 hydrogenation (Fig. 2c and Table S3) [35–38,42–45]. This means the monometallic iron catalyst holds potential to replace the iron-related system based on noble metals and Cu. To further verify the promoting effects of sulfate on alcohol synthesis, the sulfate was introduced in FeNa by wet impregnation using sodium sulfate and the obtained sample FeNaS-im was evaluated in CO2 hydrogenation reaction (Fig. 2a). The content of sulfate in FeNaS-im was controlled to be similar with FeNaS-0.6. As expected, the FeNaS-im catalyst gave rise to an enhanced selectivity to C2+OH (11.1 %) as compared to FeNa (4.6 %). Whereas its C2+OH selectivity was still lower than that of FeNaS-0.6, which is likely linked to the uneven sulfate distribution and relatively weak interaction between Fe sites and introduced sulfate as a consequence of the impregnation method. Besides, an iron catalyst with only sulfate additive was prepared (denoted FeS) for comparison, and it exhibited almost no catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation (Fig. 2a). These findings suggested that the HAS performance of FeNaS-0.6 was attributed to the synergy of Na and S in the catalyst. As reported in previous literature, sulfur is mainly perceived to be poison for iron catalysts during CO/CO2 hydrogenation, in most cases associating with geometric blocking of metal sites [46–48]. The sulfur as promoters has been reported due to its function as electron acceptor [49–53], whereas the promoting role of sulfate in HAS from CO2 hydrogenation was firstly proposed in this work. The detailed distribution of C2+OH and hydrocarbon products for FeNaS-0.6 is given as well (Fig. 3 a,b). The alcohol distribution basically followed the Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) plots as the hydrocarbon products, implying the similar reaction mechanism and intermediate (CO) between the formation of higher alcohols and hydrocarbons from CO2 hydrogenation. With regard to the much lower methanol production, thermodynamic calculation has shown that methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation is much less favorable than ethanol synthesis at low temperature due to its higher Gibbs free energy [14]. Aside from the alcohol products, both FeNaS-0.6 and FeNa exhibited high olefin/paraffin ratios among the hydrocarbon products (Table S2), which is associated with the presence of Na. Na has proved to be an effective promoter for Fe-based catalysts to promote CO dissociation, increase the hydrogenation barrier of *CH x species, and contribute to enhanced formation of olefins in CO/CO2 hydrogenation [54–56]. The comparison of catalytic performance between FeNa and pure iron catalyst (Fe) without any modification validated the promoting role of Na in CO dissociation and carbon chain growth (Fig. 2a). Besides, the inhibition effect of Na on methanation is benificial to the formation of alcohols. According to the thermodynamic calculation about equilibrium composition of CO2 hydrogenation, paraffins are more favored than higher alcohols, and the equilibrium of ethanol approaches zero when methanation is allowed as a reaction [14]. Thus the HAS catalysts are required to inhibit the formation of methane under given conditions. Exactly, the presence of Na in FeNaS-0.6 functions well in this part. Moreover, the stability of Na and S co-modified iron catalyst was investigated (Fig. 4 a,b). The space-time yield of C2+OH was basically stable at around 60 mg gcat −1 h−1 over 100 h on stream, and almost no methanol was detected during this period. Meanwhile, light olefins (C2−4 =) occupied for 47.0 % of the hydrocarbon products. Taking the product selectivity and catalytic stability into account, the sulfate content can be controlled to achieve stable co-production of high value-added light olefins and higher alcohols over monometallic iron catalysts, which provides the possibility to develop highly efficient industrial catalysts for CO2 conversion."
8,Structural and chemical characterization of iron catalysts,"3.2 Structural and chemical characterization of iron catalysts To gain insights into the origin of the HAS performance of FeNaS-0.6 catalyst, XRD and MES measurements were conducted on the spent catalysts to obtain the information concerning the active phase composition. As reflected from the results (Fig. 5 a,b, Table S4), Fe3O4 and Fe5C2 which are considered to catalyze RWGS and FTS reaction respecitively [57,58], constitute the main phases in FeNaS-0.6 during CO2 hydrogenation, showing no significant difference from that in FeNa. This suggested that the enhanced production of higher alcohols is not caused by the phase composition associated with the presence of sulfate. H2-TPR and CO2-TPD measurements were conducted to investigate the reduction and adsorption behavior of catalysts. As shown in Fig. 6 a, the main reduction peaks for FeNaS-0.6 and FeNaS-im catalysts were located at lower temperature than FeNa, demonstrating an improved reducibility upon addition of sulfate. It has been reported that the presence of sulfate in iron-based catalysts could improve the H2 adsorption by decreasing the catalyst surface basicity and further facilitate the catalyst reduction [59,60]. Considering the adsorbed CO2 could react with the reduced iron catalysts during CO2-TPD process and release CO molecules, both CO2 and CO signals were recorded for comparison (Fig. 6b). The desorption peaks located at 50–300 °C are assigned to the physically adsorbed and weakly chemisorbed CO2 on catalysts, and almost no CO signals were detected within this temperature range. The high-temperature desorption peaks are assigned to the strongly adsorbed CO2, and the relative amount of CO to CO2 desorption (CO/CO2) above 400 °C could be a reference for CO2 activation [61]. The quantitative results show that the desorption amount of CO is much larger than that of CO2 on FeNa catalyst (CO/CO2 = 1.73), corresponding to a strong ability to activate CO2 molecules, which provides evidence for its higher CO2 conversion. Whereas, much lower CO selectivity was observed over FeNa during CO2 hydrogenation, implying the further conversion of CO occurred easily. By contrast, lower ratios of CO/CO2 (0.73 for FeNaS-0.6, 1.50 for FeNaS-im) and higher CO selectivity (Fig. 2a) were observed over FeNaS-0.6 and FeNaS-im catalysts, demonstrating that the formed CO on sulfate-modified iron catalysts is more likely to be released as molecules, rather than being activated for further conversion. This suggests that the presence of sulfate could decrease the number of active sites for CO activation. The proposed role of sulfate could also explain the decreasing CO2 conversion and increasing CO selectivity over FeNaS-x with the increase of sulfate content as aforementioned (Fig. 2b). In addition, the comparison of CO2-TPD profiles between FeNa and pure iron catalyst (Fe) provides further evidence for the promoting role of Na in CO2 and CO activation (Fig. S3). XPS measurements were conducted to probe the electronic states of Fe and O atoms in the catalysts. The Fe 2p peaks of Fe atoms in Fe–C for FeNaS-0.6 and FeNaS-im (Fig. 7 a) were located at higher binding energy (706.9 eV) as compared to FeNa (706.7 eV). And this can be explained by the presence of sulfate with strong electron-withdrawing ability and facile carburization of catalyst surface. The Fe 2p peaks for FeNaS-x shifted toward higher binding energy continuously with increasing sulfate content (Fig. 7b), further corroborating the electronic effects of sulfate on Fe sites. In the O 1s region (Fig. 7c), the peaks at around 529.8, 531.3 and 535.7 eV are assigned to lattice oxygen in Fe–O, lattice oxygen in Fe–OH, and oxygen in adsorbed water, respectively [62–64]. FeNaS-0.6 and FeNaS-im presented significantly higher binding energy (531.3 and 531.4 eV) for the lattice oxygen in Fe–OH group as compared to FeNa (531.1 eV), meanwhile, no obvious difference was observed for the lattice oxygen in Fe–O. This can be explained by the fact that the lattice oxygen with close contact to sulfate are more likely to bond with hydrogen atoms (Fig. 6a). The presence of lattice oxygen with higher binding energy in FeNaS-0.6 and FeNaS-im indicated that eletron transfer from Fe–O to S–O should occur. Moreover, a larger lattice spacing of the (012) planes of α-Fe2O3 was observed in FeNaS-0.6 as compared to FeNa (Fig. 7d), further evidencing the electronic effects of sulfate on Fe–O bond. The strong electron interaction between these elements suggested the potential existence of Fe–O–S or Fe–S–O bond."
9,Role of sulfate in tuning reaction intermediates for alcohol synthesis,"3.3 Role of sulfate in tuning reaction intermediates for alcohol synthesis As mentioned before, CO as an important intermediate is crucial to reaction network, and both dissociative and non-dissociative CO activation are required for higher alcohols synthesis. Generally, CO activation on iron catalysts occurs via Fe–C σ-bonding and the simultaneous back-donation of iron valence electrons into the 2π* orbital of CO, during which the Fe–C bond is strengthened and the C–O bond is weakened [51,65]. When the C–O bond is sufficiently weak, CO dissociation occurs. Combining the XPS analysis, it can be reasonably inferred that the presence of sulfate could decrease the electron density around Fe sites and reduce its ability to back-donate electrons to C–O bond, eventually leading to weakened ability to dissociate CO. This is in line with the weakened CO activation upon addition of sulfate as mentioned in CO2-TPD analysis. CO pre-adsorption and H2-TPSR tests were carried out to further explore the impact of sulfate on CO activation. The reactivity of chemisorbed CO on catalysts under H2 flow can provide useful information about the strength of CO adsorption and the ability for CO dissociation [66]. The dissociative adsorbed CO would react with H2, and the CO signals detected during tests represent the non-dissociative CO adsorption. Regarding the main CO desorption peaks above 700 °C (Fig. 8 a), the temperature at which CO started to desorb and the corresponding maximum over sulfate-containing catalysts are lower than FeNa, indicating the presence of sulfate could weaken the bond strength of the molecularly adsorbed CO on catalysts. And this is favorable for its coupling with alkyl species to produce higher alcohols. Upon sulfate impregnation on FeNa, the amount of CO desorption increased significantly, illustrating the introduction of sulfate would bring additional Fe sites for non-dissociative CO adsorption. And the increased sites are expected to be transformed from the original dissociative adsorption Fe sites under electronic effects of sulfate. Besides, the comparison of H2 signals between FeNa and FeNaS-im (Fig. 8b) demonstrated that the H2 consumption during tests decreased significantly upon addition of sulfate, which provides further evidence for the inhibiting effects of sulfate on CO dissociation. Additionally, key intermediates on FeNa and FeNaS-im under exposure to CO2/H2 and subsequent H2 flow were monitored by in situ DRIFTS. Considering FeNaS-im was obtained through impregnating lower content of sulfate on FeNa and there is no structural difference between the two, the impact of sulfate on intermediates could be truly reflected by comparison (Fig. 9 a,b). Usually, the *CH x intermediates originated from CO dissociation are unstable and easy to be consumed via hydrogenation. It’s worth noting that obvious *CH x signals (2892 cm−1) appeared at a very early stage (1 min) on FeNa and could be retained during the reaction period, reflecting a stronger ability for CO dissociation. The absorbance intensity of *CO species (2077 cm−1) on FeNa decreased when the feed gas was switched from CO2/H2 to H2, suggesting the adsorbed CO was reactive with H2. Accordingly, it is deduced that abundant *CH x species originate from the facile CO dissociation on FeNa catalyst, and *CH x –*CH x coupling dominates during the reaction process, hence explaining its much higher selectivity to long-chain hydrocarbons. By contrast, the *CH x signals over FeNaS-im was negligible and the absorbance intensity of *CO species increased gradually as the reaction process, reflecting a weakened ability for CO dissociation upon addition of sulfate. Meanwhile, the adsorption band of *CO species on FeNaS-im shifted to lower wavenumber (2067 cm−1), which is caused by the decreased electron back-donation from Fe to the adsorbed CO under the electron-withdrawing effects of sulfate. This means the *CO species on FeNaS-im are more stable and less favorable to be dissociated. Notably, the intensity of *CO species on FeNaS-im remained unchanged when the feed gas was switched to H2, agree well with the above deduction. Overall, the FeNaS-im catalyst could activate and store more *CO species to match the *CH x species, thus promoting the formation of higher alcohols. Additionally, the intensity of the band associated with *HCOO species at 2605 cm-1 was enhanced over FeNaS-im catalyst and increased as reaction process, which is related to the enhanced hydrogenation ability upon addition of sulfate. Furthermore, gaseous CO (2210 cm-1) species appeared over FeNaS-im catalyst when the gas flow was switched to H2, implying that the formed CO on sulfate-modified iron catalyst is more likely to be released as molecules, rather than being adsorbed on the catalyst and participating in the subsequent conversion into hydrocarbons or alcohols, which is consistent with the higher CO selectivity during CO2 hydrogenation reaction. With respect to the spectra of FeNaS-0.6 (Fig. 9c), the relative absorbance intensity of *CO to *CH x was less than that of FeNaS-im based on same sulfate content, presumably because of the lower surface sulfate content on FeNaS-0.6. The sulfate in FeNaS-0.6 introduced during the precipitation process was well dispersed in the bulk structure, whereas the sulfate in FeNaS-im introduced via impregnation was more distributed on the catalyst surface. And the surface atomic ratio of S/Fe obtained from XPS confirmed this (Table S5). The absorbance intensity of *CO species was negligibly weak in the initial stage and then increased gradually as reaction, which is supposed to be relevant to the sulfate enrichment."
10,Theoretical insights into Na-S synergy for alcohol synthesis,"3.4 Theoretical insights into Na-S synergy for alcohol synthesis Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to further identify the molecule-level mechanism over FeNa and FeNaS catalysts in CO2 hydrogenation into ethanol reaction. To rationally simplify calculation, two Fe5C2 (510) model catalysts modified with Na, and co-modified with Na and S, are established to simulate FeNa and FeNaS catalysts, respectively. Firstly, the exothermic adsorption process of CO produced from RWGS is compared on above two model catalysts (Fig. S7, Table S6). The adsorption energy of FeNaS is –3.1 eV, the absolute value of which is 0.8 eV higher than that of FeNa. This result suggests that CO adsorption is more thermodynamically favorable on the Na and S co-modified iron catalyst than on the single Na modified one. It will provide additional chances for the sequent C–C coupling with *CH x species to form ethanol and other C2+ alcohols. Furthermore, starting with *CO from non-dissociative CO, and *CH2 from dissociative CO, the reaction path for ethanol synthesis is investigated in detail (Fig. 10 a,b, Table S7). It's worth noting that the first hydrogenation process into *COH from *CO is obviously different on two catalysts. The FeNa catalyst shows a typical endothermic process with an energy difference of 0.71 eV, which is not thermodynamically favorable. However, after S addition, it transfers into an exothermic process with a heat of 0.43 eV, suggesting a great promotion in the first step reaction of *CO hydrogenation. After the sequent two-step hydrogenation, the produced *H2COH is C–C coupled with surrounding *CH2 species to form CH3CH2OH finally. The final energy on the FeNaS catalyst is 0.73 eV, much lower than that of 1.60 eV on the FeNa one. The reduced energy barrier from *CO and *CH2 to ethanol demonstrates a more favorable synthesis process of ethanol, which is well consistent with previous experimental results."
11,Reaction scheme of higher alcohols synthesis over FeNaS,"3.5 Reaction scheme of higher alcohols synthesis over FeNaS Based on above well-matched experimental and theoretical evidences, selective conversion of CO2 to higher alcohols is achieved on the monometallic iron catalyst with synergistic effects of Na and S. An integrated reaction pathway for CO2 hydrogenation over FeNaS catalysts is proposed (Fig. 11 ). The adsorbed CO generated from RWGS would go through different reaction paths with the co-existence of Na and S. Given the limited amount of sulfate existed in the catalyst, majority of Fe sites could maintain its activity in CO dissociation with the assistance of Na and the strongly adsorbed CO tends to be converted into *CH x species. With respect to the rest of Fe sites with close contact to sulfate, dissociation of the adsorbed CO is inhibited, which mainly contributes to the formation of *CO rather than *CH x species. The sulfate in iron catalyst plays a role in modulating the reaction intermediates, which helps to provide more *CO species and increase the chance of *CH x –*CO coupling. Besides, the well dispersed Na and S boost the concerted action of active Fe sites with different functionality, giving enhanced production of higher alcohols."
12,Conclusions,"In summary, we proposed a monometallic Fe catalyst for the conversion of CO2 to higher alcohols, different from the commonly applied bimetallic catalysts such as Fe-Cu and Rh-Fe. The synergistic effects of Na and S in the iron catalyst are responsible for the excellent HAS performance. Na modification assists the CO dissociation, while the sulfur in the form of sulfate helps to provide more Fe sites for non-dissociative CO adsorption. The DFT theory calculation confirmed that the iron catalyst with co-modification of Na and S is very beneficial for alcohol formation due to the reduced energy barrier. The subtlety of this work is to enable Fe sites in different electronic environment in one metal phase and provide matched dissociative and non-dissociative CO activation simultaneously required for HAS. This work extends the understanding of the role of sulfur for iron catalysts and points to a new and general direction for catalyst design in HAS. Furthermore, precise control of the interplay between active metal sites and multiple promoters would be a promising strategy to tune the catalytic performance of catalysts."
