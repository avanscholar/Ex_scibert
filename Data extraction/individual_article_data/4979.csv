0,Introduction,"In order to ease the shortage of fossil fuels, hydrogen, as clean and renewable energy, has attracted widespread attention [1–5]. In principle, hydrogen can be produced by water electrolysis. This method of hydrogen production named hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a chemical reaction. Pt-based and Pd-based catalysts have been hitherto the best known as the greatest electrocatalysts of the HER but still exhibit high cost and scarcity [6–8]. This reaction remains too expensive due to the higher cost compared to fossil fuels. With the intention of improving the utilization of the HER, it is imperative to develop a cheap, durable and efficient electrocatalyst which can meet future practical use [9–11]. Transition metals and transition metal-based composites have been developed as multifarious catalysts, such as their elemental metals [12–14], alloys [15,16] and metallic-oxides [17–19], which have excellent properties of the HER in the alkaline electrolyzer. Because of the large proportion of reserves in the earth and the relatively low cost, the transition metals can effectively fill the vacancies of scarce Pt and Pd, which have better advantages for the application of the HER [20,21]. Recently, carbon materials, showing excellent application potential, have been developed as a substrate for encapsulating various forms of transition metals. The combination of the transition metal cores and the carbon shell can play a protective role under the synergistic action of the carbon cage and can promote the electrocatalytic activity and stability of the material [22–25]. Yang et al. synthesized a FeCo spherical alloy encapsulated in nitrogen-doped graphene carbon [26]. Zhang et al. synthesized the nitrogen-doped graphene-supported Co@CoO core-shell nanoparticles for overall water splitting [27]. As a catalytically active center, transition metals and transition metal-based composites which are encapsulated in carbon materials have been proven to enhance their durability against electrolyte corrosion and extend using time [28]. Nowadays, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of multifunctional porous materials composed of metal ions and organic ligands, which combine with multifarious transition metals can further enhance their activity and stability [29,30]. However, in the current literatures, most researchers focus on single-metal MOF hydrogen evolution materials or MOF hydrogen evolution materials doped with P, S and other elements, while there are few studies on multi-metal MOF hydrogen evolution materials, especially tri-metal MOF hydrogen evolution materials [31]. As is well known, MOFs have great potential as templates and reactive precursors for the preparation of nanostructured materials by thermal decomposition [32]. The most attractive feature of multi-metal MOF is that their components are designable and can be converted to carbon-coated multi-metals or multi-metal oxides with a controlled thermal cracking reaction [33,34]. Simultaneously, the morphology of currently reported MOFs is mostly solid topologies of different sizes (such as nanoparticles and polyhedral), and the presence of these large blocks limits their efficiency in structure-oriented application fields [35,36]. Therefore, reasonable tailoring of their shape, size and pore structure is the key to their application and has received great attention. The design and synthesis of MOF topography remains a huge challenge [37]. More complex structures, especially wirelike three-dimensional structures with unique efficiencies, have rarely been reported in the literature. Furthermore, existing works have proved that enhanced HER activity can be achieved by metal-metal oxide/carbon hybrids (Co-CoO nanoparticles), which are supported on carbon nanotubes or N-doped carbon [38–40]. The practical application of water decomposition for large amounts of hydrogen production is limited by the need for large overpotentials to overcome the slow dynamics of HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [41,42]. The Co element is a typical alkaline electrocatalyst with high HER performance, and cobalt oxide has better catalytic activity for OER. The above analysis means that the synergy between Co and CoO enhances the kinetics of hydrogen and oxygen produced by overall water decomposition [43–45]. In addition, bimetallic spinel oxides have been reported to exhibit significant electrocatalytic properties of the HER, such as ZnFe2O4, compared to single metal oxides [18,46,47]. Spinel oxides with double transition metal oxides offer the advantage of adjusting the energy density and operating voltage by varying the metal content [48]. Inspired by above considerations, the incorporation of multiple transition metals into MOFs, at a certain temperature, can form a cage in situ to trap the transition metal elements as the active center while maintaining the skeletal structure. Herein, we report the successful construction of an efficient wirelike tri-metallic HER electrocatalyst derived from annealing as-synthesized nanowire Co/Zn/Fe-MOF in an inert atmosphere, and the effects of different annealing temperatures on the HER performance of the as-synthesized materials were studied. The nanowire Co/Zn/Fe-MOF was formed by the addition of the surfactant polyvinylpyrrolidone, which influenced the combination of Fe, Co or Zn ions and organic ligands to enhance the interaction between metal ions and organic ligands. In this work, the carbonization of nanowires Co/Zn/Fe-MOF at a lower temperature forms a higher degree of graphitized carbon, and forms a carbon-coated metal and metal oxides coexistence structure. The unique three-dimensional wirelike structure, Co-CoO/ZnFe2O4 encapsulated in carbon nanowires, which endows the catalyst rich dispersibility and exposed reaction sites, which is of great significance for significantly improving electrochemical performance. Based on excellent performance and stability of HER, this paper can provide a reliable reference for the preparation of multi-metal MOF based hydrogen evolution materials. The wirelike Co-CoO/ZnFe2O4@CNWs composite material is expected to be an efficient hydrogen evolution material."

2,Materials and reagents,"2.1 Materials and reagents Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), Iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O), Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O), Polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 (PVP-K30), terephthalic acid (PTA) and methanol (CH3OH) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. All materials were analytical grade and used without any further purification."
3,Preparation of the nanowire Co/Zn/Fe-MOF,"2.2 Preparation of the nanowire Co/Zn/Fe-MOF Typically, Co(NO3)2·6H2O (3 mmol), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (1 mmol) and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (3 mmol) was dissolved in methyl alcohol (80 mL), followed by adding PTA (3 mmol) and PVP-K30 (0.4 g). After stirring for 15 min, the mixed solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and then heated under 120 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the collected powder was centrifuged and washed with methyl alcohol for three times. Finally, the obtained product was dried at 60 °C for 12 h, and the nanowire Co/Zn/Fe-MOF precursor was obtained."
4,Preparation of the Co-CoO/ZnFe2O4@CNWs,"2.3 Preparation of the Co-CoO/ZnFe2O4@CNWs The nanowire Co/Zn/Fe-MOF precursor was annealed to 400 °C with a rate of 2 °C/min and maintained for 2 h in N2 atmosphere. To study the influence of the annealing temperature, the precursor was annealed to 500 °C and 600 °C in the controlled experiments. All samples are labeled as S-400 °C, S-500 °C and S-600 °C, respectively."
5,Material characterization,"2.4 Material characterization The microstructures and morphologies of the Co-CoO/ZnFe2O4@CNWs were investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2010, Japan) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL, Japan) equipped with the energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) system. The crystal information of these samples was obtained by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku). Raman spectra was recorded using the inVia confocal spectrometer (inVia, Renishaw, UK). N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were used to analyze the specific surface areas by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The chemical compositions of these samples were analyzed by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG Scientific)."
6,Electrochemical analyses,"2.5 Electrochemical analyses The electrochemical measurements were carried out on electrochemical workstation (model, CHI660E), conducted in KOH solutions (1.0 M), which was a three-electrode cell that allowed monitoring the volume of gas at the electrode. Glassy carbon electrode (GCE), Pt wire and Hg/HgO/NaOH(1.0 M) electrode were used as working electrodes, counter electrodes and reference electrodes, respectively. 5 mg of Co-CoO/ZnFe2O4@CNWs was mixed with 950 μL ethanol and 50 μL of 5% Nafion, and then sonicate for 30 min. 10 μL of the sample was dropped on GCE and dried at room temperature. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests of the Co-CoO/ZnFe2O4@CNWs electrodes were carried out at the scan rates of 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 mV s−1. The calculations of electrochemical double layer capacitances (Cdl) were obtained by using CV curves from 20 to 100 mV s−1 scan rates. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was examined at the sweep rate of 5 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were examined from 105 to 10-1 Hz at the open circle voltage. All of the potentials were translated into the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by the following equation: E(RHE) = E(Hg/HgO) + 0.095 + 0.059 pH."
7,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 illustrates the synthetic process of the Co-CoO/ZnFe2O4@CNWs catalysts. Initially, the Co/Zn/Fe-MOF was synthesized by a hydrothermal method, and PVP-K30 was added as a surfactant, which plays an important role in adjusting the dispersion state of metal ions and ligands. After that, the final products were obtained through annealing the Co/Zn/Fe-MOF at a certain temperature in N2 atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the XRD patterns of S-400 °C, S-500 °C and S-600 °C were described to clarify the phase structure evolution from Co/Zn/Fe-MOF to the Co-CoO/ZnFe2O4 composite materials. The three intense peaks at 36.5°, 42.4° and 61.5° are ascribed to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0) and (2 2 0) planes of CoO, respectively (JCPDS no. 43-1004). The peaks at about 35.3°, 42.8° and 56.6° correspond to the (3 1 1), (4 0 0) and (5 1 1) planes of ZnFe2O4, respectively (JCPDS no. 22-1012). The peak of metal Co appears at 44.6° of S-400 °C, which is ascribed to the (1 1 1) planes (JCPDS no. 15-0806). With the increase of calcination temperature, the crystallinity of the metal increases, and the diffraction peak intensity strengthened, which explains for the presence of strengthened diffraction peak intensity appears in S-500 °C and S-600 °C. Additionally, some new diffraction peaks due to the elemental Co and the FeCo alloy can be observed for S-500 °C and S-600 °C (JCPDS no. 15-0806, JCPDS no. 49-1568), which indicates that high temperature are unfavorable for the formation of CoO and ZnFe2O4 because of oxygen removal at such temperature by carbon. The XRD results show that the pyrolysis temperature has an important influence on the composition of the sample, which may lead to different electrocatalytic activities. The graphitization degree of S-400 °C was detected by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 2b). The two broad bands at 1340 and 1580 cm−1 are assigned to the typical D and G bands of amorphous carbon, respectively. The small ID/IG value (0.74) implies a high degree of graphitization, which is beneficial for electrocatalysis. The microstructural morphologies and characteristics of the prepared materials are characterized by SEM test. SEM images (Fig. 3 a-c) show the S-400 °C sample is shaped like intertwined nanowires. The elemental mapping of S-400 °C (Figure S1) indicates the homogeneous distributions of C, Fe, Co and Zn elements, and the actual contents were determined by EDS (Figure S2). Clearly, the width of these nanowires is around 30 nm, and the shapes of nanowires are also retained after the calcination, which are attested by the TEM images (Fig. 3d and e). Moreover, the structure existence of Co-CoO/ZnFe2O4@CNWs is further confirmed by the TEM test. The TEM images (Fig. 3d and e) reveal a true that the metal complexes are encapsulated in carbon nanowires. Figure S3a and b show that S-500 °C and S-600 °C are agglomerated in a large amount during the calcination process to form many large particle crystal forms, which leads to the absence of the defect sits of the catalyst and matches the results of X-ray analysis of S-500 °C and S-600 °C with relatively strong peak intensity. However, the large particle crystal forms are detrimental to the progress of the hydrogen evolution reaction. Meanwhile, HRTEM images (Fig. 3f) can be used as further detailed evidence that have been provided. S-400 °C sample has well-resolved lattice fringe with interplanar spacings of 0.207, 0.214 and 0.257 nm, consistent with the XRD results of Co-CoO/ZnFe2O4@CNWs, which perfectly correspond to the (1 1 1) plane of the Co phase, the (2 0 0) plane of the CoO phase and the (3 1 1) plane of the ZnFe2O4 phase, respectively [49,50]. The above TEM analysis confirmed that Co, CoO and ZnFe2O4 are co-existing and are surrounded by carbon nanowires. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas of all as-prepared samples were studied by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms (Fig. 4 ). As listed in Table 1 , the specific surface area of S-400 °C was 228.5 m2 g−1, which was higher than this of S-500 °C and S-600 °C. The larger specific surface area is also beneficial for electrocatalysis, which is in favor of the large exposure of active sites, and enables a boost of the construction of the accessible electrocatalyst-electrolyte-gas interface for electrocatalysis during ionization. The detailed elemental chemical states of S-400 °C composites were further investigated by XPS, and the XPS survey spectrum of Co, Fe, Zn, C, N and O elements were displayed in Figure S4. As shown in Fig. 5 a, the XPS spectrum of Co 2p, the peaks at 796.6 eV was derived from the Co 2p1/2, which matched with the binding energy of Co2+. The peaks at 778.3 eV, 780.6 eV and 803.5 eV were well suited with Co 2p3/2, which corresponded to the binding energy of Co0 and Co2+, respectively [51]. The peaks situated at 785.9 eV and 793.5 eV were ascribed to the weak satellite peaks, and the satellite peak at 785.9 eV suggested the existence of CoC (N) species. In addition, the doping of O may be ascribed to the effect of metal-bound COOH present in precursor ligands, and the doping of N may date from the annealing of N2 atmosphere. In terms of the XPS spectrum of Fe 2p (Fig. 5b), high-resolution Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 spectrums showed the peaks located at 713.8 eV and 724.9 eV, respectively, corresponding the binding energy of Fe3+ and Fe2+. The peak at 711.1 eV was assigned to the existence of chemical bonding Fe and O dopants. The remaining two peaks at 718.7 eV and 733.8 eV belonged to the satellite peak [52]. As the XPS spectrum of the Zn 2p displayed in Fig. 5c, 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks occurred at 1021.9 eV and 1044.9 eV, respectively, which indicated the existence of Zn2+ [53]. The core-level spectrum of C in Fig. 5d showed the stack of three peaks at 284.8 eV, 285.6 eV and 288.7 eV, corresponding to CC/CC, CO and CO bonds respectively. Compared with the weak CO peak and CO peak, the intense CC/CC peak indicated the high degree of graphitization of carbon matrix [54]. Furthermore, the different CV curves were obtained at different scan rates (20, 40, 60, 80, 100 mV s−1) of the S-400 °C, S-500 °C and S-600 °C samples in the 1.0 M KOH (Fig. 6 a, b and c). The electrochemical activity is related to the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), which is directly proportional to the Cdl of electrochemical catalyst [55]. In general, the higher the ECSA value, the richer the active site [56]. As shown in Fig. 6d, the different Cdl curves of the S-400 °C, S-500 °C and S-600 °C samples indicate the largest Cdl value (0.11 mF cm−2) in S-400 °C. The excellent performance of ECSA on S-400 °C shows that the calcination temperature has a great influence on the defects and conductivity of graphitized nano-carbon material. The electrochemical performance of all the prepared catalysts for the HER process was evaluated using the LSV at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 by the three-electrode system in 1.0 M KOH solution. As a comparative, commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst was evaluated under the same conditions [57]. As expected, the Pt/C electrode exhibited extraordinary performance at relatively small overpotentials and high current densities (Fig. 7 a). As Fig. 7a shown, the LSV curves were obtained in the range of 0.6 to −0.8 V (vs. RHE), which suggested that S-400 °C catalytic had excellent electrocatalytic efficiency because of a smaller overpotential of 226 mV (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm−2 than other prepared catalysts. Compared with the S-500 °C and S-600 °C, the better HER performance of S-400 °C should be related to the higher degree of graphitization of carbon and the larger size of surface areas, and S-400 °C catalytic has given more defects and active centers due to its unique structure. In order to highlight the advantages of the ternary Co-CoO/ZnFe2O4@CNWs system, it is necessary to study the HER performance of Co-CoO@CNWs, ZnFe2O4@CNWs and Co-CoO/ZnFe2O4. Based on the original synthesis steps of Co/Zn/Fe-MOF, we prepared Co-CoO@CNWs and ZnFe2O4@CNWs. And Co-CoO/ZnFe2O4 was prepared by annealing in air. At the same time, the Figure S5 and Figure S6 were used to further prove that the prepared products are required structure and composition by us. As shown in the Figure S7, the S-400 °C has better HER performance than Co-CoO@CNWs, ZnFe2O4@CNWs, and Co-CoO/ZnFe2O4. In other words, the superior HER performance of the ternary Co-CoO/ZnFe2O4@CNWs system is exhibited. Furthermore, the Tafel plots (Fig. 7b) of all prepared samples were discussed to further investigate the electrocatalytic HER activity. The Tafel plot from the LSV curve study was used to determine the HER kinetics of the prepared samples, as shown in Fig. 7b [58]. Compared with S-500 °C (146 mV dec−1) and S-600 °C (207 mV dec−1), the lower corresponding Tafel slope of S-400 °C (138 mV dec−1) was observed, which suggested better HER kinetics and demonstrated the improved intrinsic HER activity of S-400 °C. HER stability in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte was also carried out by Chronoamperometric test, which is an important parameter to evaluate catalyst. The long-term stability test in Fig. 7c showed that the current density of the S-400 °C catalyst remained very stable and did not significantly degrade within 12 h at an overpotential of 97 mV, indicating excellent HER stability in alkaline media. In addition, CV curves were also used to evaluate the stability of S-400 °C. As shown in Fig. 7d, a negligible decrease of overpotential value after 1000 cycles compared to the initial curve further confirmed the significant stability of S-400 °C over long-term electrochemical tests. The unique structure of the S-400 °C catalyst facilitates the hydrogen evolution reaction (Fig. 8 ). The encapsulation of the carbon material promotes the enhancement of the conductivity of the catalyst and prevents the electrochemical dissolution of the active center. The doping of a small amount of nitrogen facilitates the formation of a defect center of the catalyst. The synergistic effect of Co, CoO and ZnFe2O4 provide the rich defect sites and active centers, which lead to efficient hydrogen evolution performance when the composite is used as a catalytic electrode for HER in 1.0 M KOH."
8,Conclusions,"In summary, we used a facile method to synthesize Co-CoO/ZnFe2O4 encapsulated in carbon nanowires, which was obtained by adjusting the annealing temperature of the pre-synthesized nanowire-shaped Co/Zn/Fe-MOF. Electrochemical measurements showed that S-400 °C exhibits the best performance of HER, due to the presence of graphitic carbon, better particle dispersion and smaller particle size. Besides, the higher specific surface areas and carbon nanowire enveloping structure impart the abundant, dispersed and exposed active sites to the catalyst, which favors HER activity. Particularly, in the case where the outer layer of carbon allows the catalyst to have better electrical conductivity, the synergistic effect of Co and CoO in the internal Co-CoO/ZnFe2O4 has improved charge transfer, mass transfer and accelerated HER kinetics in alkaline solution. Simultaneously, ZnFe2O4 demonstrating the potential for highly efficient electrocatalysis of HER and good catalytic stability in the long-term operation. This facile carbon nanowire-wrapped Co-CoO/ZnFe2O4 composites may pave the way for the design of new nanomaterials, producing highly efficient hydrogen for electrolyzed water."
