0,Introduction,"The great potential of photocatalysis for degradation and organic synthesis had been realized by Ciamician one century ago [1], as sunlight is an abundant, clean and sustainable form of energy. Research on semiconductor photocatalysis have progressed remarkably since Fujishima and Honda first reported the photocatalytic splitting of water by TiO2 in 1972 [2]. However, the band gap of TiO2 is around 3.2 eV requiring the utilisation of ultraviolet radiation [3,4]. Subsequently, various photocatalysts have been exploited by coupling TiO2 with a second component [5], such as M/TiO2 (M = noble metal) [6–9], Fe/TiO2 [10], CuOx/TiO2 [11], C/TiO2 [12], WO3/TiO2 [13], and BiOI/TiO2 [14]. Gold exhibits remarkable catalytic activity when subdivided to a few nanometer size [15,16]. In addition to their well-known catalytic activity for oxidation of a range of substrates including CO, alkenes, aldehydes and alcohols, Au nanoparticles display excellent photocatalytic properties [6,17,18]. Indeed, Au/TiO2 has been established as one of the most important model photocatalysts for both oxidation and reduction reactions [6,19,20]. The active charge state of Au, influence of particle size, catalyst structure sensitivity, and the Au-support interaction have been thoroughly investigated [6,19]. Noble metal nanoparticles exhibit a unique property upon irradiation with light of a specific wavelength known as localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) [21–25]. When the frequency of photons matches that of the surface electrons oscillating against the restoring force of positive nuclei, it induces a coherent collective oscillation of the valence electrons. The resonant wavelength and intensity of the surface plasmon resonance depend on the nature of the metal, size and shape of the metallic nanostructures [26]. The interaction of photons with the surface electrons of Au spherical nanoparticles results in an absorption band with maximum at ∼ 520 nm [21,27]. Essentially, surface plasmon resonance concentrates the light flux in the vicinity of the nanostructure. Due to their strong absorbance in the visible light region, it offers an opportunity for wide band gap materials such as TiO2 to function as visible light photocatalysts through coupling with the nanoparticles [6–9]. Nanostars are nanoparticles with a characteristic morphology of multiple sharp branches protruding from a central core [28]. The presence of sharp edges and tips on the nanoparticles results in a concentration of the electric field during localized surface plasmon resonance [29]. The local electric field can be several orders of magnitude higher than found with other morphologies such as nanospheres or nanorods [30]. This property makes nanostars promising candidates for applications in photocatalysis. However, because of the high local electric fields, the structures are very unstable and easily undergo Ostwald ripening to be reshaped into a spherical morphology [31,32]. It is therefore challenging to employ them as a photocatalyst in photo-induced organic reactions. The selective oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds such as aldehydes and ketones is an important organic reaction both in laboratory research and industrial production. Carbonyl compounds are key ingredients in products like perfumes, fragrances and spices [33]. Molecular oxygen is an atom economical green oxidant forming only water as possible coproduct. However, the use of molecular oxygen at the elevated temperatures normally required for such oxidation reactions poses a significant safety hazard due to the flammability of the solvents. Therefore, interest in photocatalytic aerobic oxidation processes has grown over the past decades as it offers a green, sustainable and inherently safer low-temperature route towards important intermediates [34]. Various photocatalysts have been developed to achieve efficient conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde [35–37]. The present work is motivated by an interest to utilize the LSPR of Au nanoparticles, especially Au nanostars, for the aerobic photo-oxidation of various alcohols. As the synthesis of Au nanostars is not trivial, various parameters were first investigated. It was found that the seed amount critically influenced the synthesis while the growth time had no obvious effect. Surfactants used in the capping solution were essential to stabilize the Au nanostars. Following their successful synthesis, the nanoparticles were encapsulated by TiO2 for mechanical robustness and chemical synergy. The photoactivity was tested with aerobic benzyl alcohol oxidation as a model reaction and compared with that of spherical and rod shaped nanoparticles. The scope of this hybrid photocatalyst was explored for the aerobic photo-oxidation of a series of alcohols."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation 2.1.1 Synthesis of Au nanostars (AuNS) 95 mL of a 0.5 mM HAuCl4 solution was first brought to boiling in a 200 mL round bottom flask. Then, 5 mL of sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate solution was added into the solution and stirring was continued for 15 min. The solution obtained was the gold seed solution, which after cooling to room temperature could be kept at 8 °C for several days. To obtain the gold nanostars, 1 mL of the gold seed solution was added to 10 mL of 0.25 mM HAuCl4 containing 10 μL of 1.0 M HCl in a 20 mL glass vial at room temperature under stirring at 900 rpm. This was followed by the simultaneous addition of 100 μL of 3 mM AgNO3 and 50 μL of 100 mM ascorbic acid. The colour of the solution rapidly changed from light red to dark blue. The solution was added into a capping solution consisted of 1.6 mL thiophenol solution (0.5 mM) and 3.2 mL CTAC solution (1 mM) and left to stand for 30 min. The solution was then centrifuged to remove the supernatant and the obtained gold nanostars (AuNS) were redispersed in 3 mL of 1 mM CTAC solution. 2.1.2 Synthesis of Au nanospheres (AuNSP) 0.097 g of sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate was dissolved in 150 mL deionized (DI) water in a 250 mL round bottom flask. After boiling, 1 mL of 25 mM HAuCl4 was added dropwise to form the seed solution. The solution was stirring for 15 min and cooled to 90 °C. Subsequently, growth solutions comprising 1 mL of 25 mM HAuCl4 at a time was added followed by stirring for 30 min. To keep the volume and dilution conditions constant, 55 mL solution was taken out and replaced by 53 mL DI water and 2 mL 60 mM sodium citrate solution before each addition. In this work, AuNSP with narrow size distribution were prepared by adding HAuCl4 8 times. 2.1.3 Synthesis of TiO2 encapsulated Au nanoparticles For synthesis of TiO2 encapsulated Au nanostars, typically, 1.125 mL of titanium tetrabutoxide dissolved in 2 mL ethanol were added dropwise into 22 mL DI water acidified with 0.242 mL of concentrated nitric acid under vigorous stirring. Stirring was continued overnight to get a clear solution. A required amount of the synthesized Au nanostars was added into the obtained solution. The typical loading was 0.5 wt. % Au with reference to TiO2. After dispersing uniformly, 1 M NaOH was added dropwise into the dark blue colored solution to precipitate the solid product. A dark blue solid slurry formed which was filtered, washed with DI water and dried at room temperature overnight in vacuum oven. The obtained catalyst is referred to as AuNS@TiO2. The TiO2 encapsulated Au nanospheres and Au nanorods were synthesized by the same method. Au nanospheres or Au nanorods were used instead and the materials are referred to as AuNSP@TiO2 and AuNR@TiO2, respectively. The Au nanorods were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization X-Ray diffractograms of the gold nanoparticles and photocatalysts were measured using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu-Kα α radiation. The recording range of 2θ θ was from 20° to 80° with a step size of 0.02° and 0.5 s dwell time. For the measurements, the particles were washed with deionized water for 3 times before being dispersed into DI water. A drop of the dispersion was casted onto a Bruker Si low background sample holder and dried in air. This procedure was repeated multiple times until a sufficient coverage of the holder was achieved. The surface area and porosity of the photo-catalysts were calculated from N2 sorption isothermal measurements using a Micromeritics Tristar 3000. Prior to measurements, samples were degassed in vacuum at room temperature overnight. Transmission electron micrographs (TEM) were performed on a JEOL 3010 transmission electron microscope system operated at 300 kV. The Au nanoparticles were washed with DI water for 3 times before being suspended in DI water. A drop of the suspension was then drop-cast onto a carbon-coated copper grid and left to dry in air overnight. Alternatively, the photocatalyst sample was suspended in ethanol prior to transferring one drop onto a copper grid. UV–Vis spectroscopy was carried out using a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer with a step size of 0.5 nm. Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) was measured on a Shimadzu UV-2450 UV–vis spectrophotometer with BaSO4 as the reference. The absorption of infrared spectra was recorded with 2 cm−1 resolution on a Bruker ALPHA spectrometer with an attenuated total reflection unit (ATR-FTIR). The elemental composition was determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (Optima 5300 DV ICP-OES). The sample (∼ 5 mg) was dissolved into an acid solution of 1 mL HCl, 0.5 mL HNO3 and 0.5 mL HF followed by heating at 371 K for 1 h."
4,Catalyst evaluation,"2.3 Catalyst evaluation Typically, 50 mg of catalyst was suspended in 5 mL of solvent followed by adding 0.1 mmol of benzyl alcohol in a Pyrex glass tube. The reaction was irradiated by a 24 W fluorescent lamp (λ ∼ 400–650 nm). The reaction temperature was 304 K, slightly above room temperature due to heating from the lamp. Aliquots were extracted at specific intervals, filtered, and analysed using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890 N) equipped with a HP-5 column (30 m ×0.32 mm × 0.25 μm film) and a flame ionization detector. The products were identified using an Agilent/HP 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with 5973 mass selective detector (GC–MS). For recyclability testing, the catalyst was filtered, washed by acetone and dried at room temperature in a vacuum oven."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Physicochemical properties,"3.1 Physicochemical properties 3.1.1 Optimization of Au nanostar (AuNS) synthesis Several parameters are critical for the successful synthesis of AuNS particles. Ascorbic acid serves as a reducing agent for HAuCl4. The AuNS form only in the presence of Ag+ which assists in the anisotropic growth of tips through underpotential deposition (UPD) of Ag+ on certain crystal facets of the Au seeds [38,39]. This is because the deposition of Ag+ is more favorable on high energy facets, such as {110}, {100} [40]. Furthermore, under acidic conditions, a red-shift of the plasmon resonance is often observed over time due to slow intra-particle smoothing [38,39,41]. In this work, two additional parameters, growth time and Au seed amount, were investigated (Fig. 1 a). The amount of Au seeds affected the LSPR significantly [42,43]. Without any seeds, the Au solution show a broad absorption from 540 to 1000 nm with peak maximum at 930 nm due to LSPR. With the addition of Au seeds, the LSPR was shifted to shorter wavelengths. The absorption edge decreased from 540 to 480 nm. With 1.5 mL or more Au seed solution, an unresolved hump with maximum at 530 nm could be observed. This can be explained by the presence of excess seeds which led to the formation of core Au particles with short tips. Thus, 1.0 mL of Au seed solution corresponding to a 1: 1.5 ratio of seed solution to HAuCl4 growth solution gave the best results. In contrast, the growth time has much less effect on the LSPR as shown in Fig. 1b. Despite varying the growth time 10–90 s, the absorption spectra remained almost unchanged. Therefore, the synthesis time is not critical. 3.1.2 Stabilization of AuNS It is well known that the gold nanostars are not stable and the anisotropic morphology tends to smoothen by an Ostwald ripening process [31,32]. This morphological change is reflected by a blue-shift in the LSPR spectra of the nanostars (Fig. 2 a). Various stabilizing/capping agents have been reported to stabilize the morphology of Au nanostars. Polymers like polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and thiolated polyethylene glycol (PEG-SH) can cover the active surfaces of the Au nanostars but their presence may cause a reduction in the efficiency for photocatalysis [31]. It is therefore preferable to use thiolated organic molecules, such as 4-mercaptobenzoic acid and thiohexanoic acid, which can be removed by washing with water. In this work, the combination of thiophenol and the surfactant cetyl trimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) was chosen as the capping agent for Au nanostar stabilization. The formation of strong Au-S bonds between the Au atoms and thiophenol limits atom mobility and suppresses the migration of Au atoms from the tips towards the base [44,45]. By following the change of the optical spectrum over time, the optimum concentration of thiophenol and CTAC can be determined. As shown in Fig. 2b, when the Au nanostars were incubated in 1 mM CTAC solution and 0.5 mM of thiophenol, there was no significant shift in the LSPR peak even after 72 h. 3.1.3 Textural properties of Au nanoparticles Irrespective of the morphology, the XRD spectra of the Au nanoparticles showed diffraction peaks at 2θ ∼ 38°, 45°, 65° and 78° which correspond to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) lattice planes, respectively (PDF 00−04-0784) (Fig. S1). In the AuNS and AuNSP (Au nanosphere), the peak with the highest intensity was the (111) diffraction whereas the (200) was the main peak in the nanorods (AuNR). The differences in the relative intensities of the diffraction peaks show that different planes were dominant as a result of morphological changes. The AuNSP particles were prepared by seed-assisted synthesis where the growth solutions was added at intervals to the seed solution. The step-wise addition of growth solution was necessary to allow the formation of large and uniform Au nanospheres. The growth kinetics were followed by UV–vis spectroscopy (Fig. 3 ). The maximum of the absorption peak shifted from 524.5–535.5 nm after the addition of the second and eight growth solutions, respectively. A reddish orange colloidal solution was obtained after this final addition. From TEM measurements, the nanospherical particles had rather uniform size of 48 ± 3 nm. Gold nanorods were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. The average length of the rods was 109 ± 8 nm and the diameter was 27 ± 3 nm. The UV–Vis spectrum of AuNR shows a broad peak at 839 nm together with a smaller peak at 512 nm. The AuNS particles could be clearly observed by TEM. The average size of the nanostars was 80 ± 7 nm. The solution of AuNS particles had an intense dark blue color, which is attributed to the strong absorption from 500 to 1000 nm. The electric field intensity distribution of AuNS and AuNSP was simulated using the Finite Domain Time Difference (FDTD) method [46]. The results show that electric field intensity was significantly higher for the nanostars than the nanospheres of a similar size (Fig. S2). The most intense electric fields are centred around the tips of the nanostars. 3.1.4 TiO2 encapsulated Au nanoparticles In order to form stable particles that do not change their shape and size over time, the Au nanoparticles were encapsulated by TiO2. Synthesis requiring high temperatures or a calcination step have to be avoided as they will accelerate the Ostwald ripening and result in spherical gold nanoparticles. The TiO2 precursor, titanium butoxide, was hydrolysed in a solution acidified with nitric acid. In excess water, the hydrolysis of titanium butoxide results in the rapid formation of basic building blocks containing [TiO6] octahedra that initially appeared as a white precipitate due to aggregation [47]. The basic building blocks of titanium dioxide gradually become peptized in the acidic medium as protonation leads to the formation of [Ti(OH)2(H2O)4]2+ [48]. This is followed by condensation of the [Ti(OH)2(H2O)4]2+ moieties to form larger units of TiO2. The gold nanoparticles present in the system serves as anchor points, allowing condensation of the TiO2 basic units to occur at the surface. This leads eventually to the formation of an encapsulated structure (Fig. 4 and S3). TEM images show that the nanoparticles are embedded in TiO2 of low crystallinity. The morphology and size of the particles are retained in the TiO2 matrix. For AuNS@TiO2, an etching experiment using aqua regia without HF was carried out to check the efficiency of encapsulation. Since TiO2 is not attacked by aqua regia, only surface-attached gold particles will be removed. Based on the ICP results, the amount of etched Au was only 0.085 wt.% (Table S1). Thus, about 82 % of the Au was fully encapsulated by TiO2 in the AuNS particles. The surface area of TiO2 formed by this method is very high, 204 m2/g (Fig. S4). Similarly, the encapsulated materials have surface areas of 193–236 m2/g. The XRD pattern of the TiO2 is characteristic of the anatase phase (PDF 00−04-0784) [49]. The broad peaks reflect the low crystallinity of TiO2 formed at room temperature (Fig. S5). The crystallinity was estimated to be 31.3 % based on a comparison of the XRD peak area with that of a fully crystalline TiO2 after calcination at 500 °C for 6 h (Fig. S6). In the TiO2 encapsulated samples, the peaks of Au (PDF 00−21-1272) could still be clearly identified although the metal loading is only 0.5 wt. %. The large Au particle size gives rise to sharp peaks of high intensity which can be discerned above the background. The diffuse reflection spectrum (DRS) of TiO2 shows almost no absorbance within the 400–900 nm region due to its broad bandgap (Fig. 5 ). After encapsulation of the Au nanoparticles, the absorbance in the wavelength region > 500 nm was increased due to LSPR. For AuNSP@TiO2, there was a broad absorbance from 400 to 650 nm. For AuNR@TiO2, new absorbance features at wavelengths up to 880 nm could be detected. Despite having the same Au content as the other two samples, AuNS@TiO2 possessed a much higher absorbance, in agreement with a stronger LSPR effect of the nanostar particles."
7,Catalytic performance,"3.2 Catalytic performance The aerobic photo-oxidation of benzyl alcohol under visible light was chosen as model reaction to test the efficiency of the TiO2 encapsulated Au nanoparticles. A suitable solvent was identified in a solvent screen using 50 mg AuNS@TiO2 and 0.1 mmol benzyl alcohol in 5 mL solvent under irradiation from a 24 W fluorescent lamp (λ > 400 nm). With water, acetonitrile and toluene, the conversion was lower than 42 % after 4 h (Fig. 6 ). On the other hand, using benzotrifluoride (BTF) as solvent resulted in 97 % conversion (initial rate of 0.113 mM min−1). This result can be attributed to the high oxygen solubility in BTF [50]. Hence, BTF was chosen as solvent for subsequent photoactivity investigations. The reaction for each catalyst was repeated 3 times and the average results are plotted in Fig. 7 a. Both commercially available P25 TiO2 (Degussa) and synthesized TiO2 show very low photo-oxidation activity as its wide bandgap of 3.2 eV means that there is very little absorption of the visible light. Incorporation of the Au nanoparticles allows for the absorbance of visible light due to LSPR. Hence, the photoactivity was considerably enhanced. For AuNSP and AuNR, the initial reaction rates were 0.072 and 0.089 mM min−1 and after 4 h, the conversion of benzyl alcohol was 82 and 89 %, respectively. Notably, for AuNS@TiO2, the aerobic photo-oxidation of benzyl alcohol was 1.3–1.6 times faster and reached 97 % conversion in 4 h. A higher metal loading of 1.0 wt. % led to > 99 % conversion after 3 h. The selectivity to benzaldehyde was > 99 % with no further oxidation to benzoic acid. The high selectivity has been attributed to inhibition by benzyl alcohol in intercepting the benzoylperoxy radical via hydrogen atom transfer [51]. The catalyst was recycled by washing with acetone and drying under vacuum. The regenerated AuNS@TiO2 maintained its photoactivity for three runs (Fig. 7b). Examination by TEM revealed that the particles in the thrice-recycled AuNS@TiO2 still had the star-shaped morphology (Fig. S7). The photoactivity of the TiO2 encapsulated Au nanoparticles can be attributed to a number of factors. One is fast charge injection from the Au nanoparticle into the TiO2 surface upon light irradiation. Due to close contact between the plasmonic Au nanoparticles and TiO2, hot electrons generated by surface plasmon decay can rapidly cross over the interfacial Schottky barrier into the conduction band of TiO2 [52]. On reaching the surface of TiO2, O2 is reduced to the superoxide anion ( O2 −) [53]. Although Au nanoparticles with any of the three morphologies can generate such “hot” electrons, the much stronger LSPR in Au nanostars means a higher photon absorption. In addition, the strong local electric field around the Au tips increases the lifetime of the electron by preventing fast charge recombination with holes in the Au nanoparticles and also facilitates the transfer of photo-electrons from Au to TiO2 [7,9,21,54]. The high density of hydroxyl groups at the surface of the TiO2 is important for the binding and activation of molecular oxygen to form superoxide anion radicals ( O2 −) at the surface. Since the TiO2 was prepared by hydrolysis of titanium tetrabutoxide followed by drying at room temperature, the surface is largely terminated by −OH groups. A broad peak at ∼ 3640 cm-1 can be observed in the FTIR of the sample, which is assigned to terminal ν OH on the TiO2 surface (Fig. S8) [55]. The intensity of this peak was much higher than for P25 TiO2. The presence of surface −OH groups on TiO2 had been shown to significantly enhance the formation of the alkoxide intermediate and to assist in the benzyl alcohol oxidation [56–58]. Mechanistically, the superoxide radical anion can participate directly to dissociate the methylene C–H bond of the adsorbed benzyl alcoholate, forming benzaldehyde and the hydroperoxo radical ( OOH) as shown by Kobayashi and Higashimoto [56,57]. In addition, the O2 − can react with H+ to form H2O2 and ·OH radical as oxidizing species. The scope of AuNS@TiO2 was tested for the aerobic photo-oxidation of a number of benzylic alcohols (Table 1 ). The conversion of 4-methyl benzyl alcohol was comparable to that of benzyl alcohol (entries 1 & 2). However, the presence of the strongly electron donating −OCH3 group in the benzene ring increased the rate of reaction so that ∼ 100 % conversion of 4-methoxy benzyl alcohol was observed (entry 3). These results suggest that the rate of photo oxidation is largely influenced by an inductive effect. Similarly, 1-phenylethanol was only 51 % converted to acetophenone (entry 4) but the methoxy-substituted 1-phenylethanol (entry 5) had ∼ 100 % conversion. In contrast, the introduction of electron withdrawing -NO2 group almost completely inhibited the oxidation to the aldehyde (entry 7). The conversion of the cyclic alcohol, cyclohexanol, was lower than the benzylic alcohols (entry 8). The results suggest that the rate of photo oxidation is largely influenced by an inductive effect. Being a weak electron releasing group, the inductive effect of −CH3 is much smaller compared to −OCH3 so the rate of conversion is close to that of benzyl alcohol. On the other hand, the negative inductive effect of the –NO2 group reduced the reaction rate drastically. The lower conversion of 1-phenylethanol and cyclohexanol is expected due to steric hindrance and the stability of the secondary alcohols. These results show that the AuNS@TiO2 photocatalyst can tolerate a range of alcohols to form the carbonyl compounds with high selectivity."
8,Conclusions,"Star-shaped gold nanoparticles were successfully synthesized using Ag+ ions and a capping solution containing CTAC and thiophenol. Optimization of the synthesis of AuNS revealed that the amount of seed solution was critical with a ratio of 1:1.5 of seed : growth solution being optimum. Interestingly, the synthesis was rather insensitive to changes in the growth time. The gold nanostars as well as spherical and rod-shaped Au nanoparticles were encapsulated with TiO2 to stabilize their morphology and the composite materials were used as heterogeneous photocatalysts for the aerobic photo-oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. AuNS@TiO2 had the highest catalytic activity among the photocatalysts synthesized, resulting in 97 % conversion after 4 h under irradiation by a 24 W fluorescent lamp. This catalyst also shows good activity for the oxidation of other benzylic and cyclic alcohols with molecular oxygen as an oxidant with high atom economy. The photocatalytic activity of recovered AuNS@TiO2 was maintained, indicating the value of low temperature encapsulation as a viable process to transform Au nanoparticles into robust catalysts."
