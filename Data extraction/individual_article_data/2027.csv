0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is considered as the most clean energy carrier (Cammack et al. 2001). Biological hydrogen production using fermentative microorganisms provides an excellent possibility to produce hydrogen economically on large scales. This process depends upon the presence of hydrogen-producing enzymes (Rita and Andreas 2004). Hydrogenases catalyze the reversible reaction, H2↔2H+ +2e−, and play a vital role in the energy metabolism of many microorganisms. They have been classified into [NiFe]-, [FeFe]- and [Fe]-hydrogenases, based on their metals contained in the active center (Vignais et al. 2001). A number of hydrogenase genes from aerobic-, anaerobic-, photosynthetic- and cyano-bacteria have been cloned and sequenced. Hydrogenase is a complex enzyme whose synthesis requires the structural genes as well as a number of accessory genes (Kovács et al. 2002). The structural genes of hydrogenases are usually transcribed together with accessory genes as a unit. Most hydrogenases consist of a large subunit (45–72kDa) and a small subunit (20–35kDa). The genes encoding the small subunits are usually located upstream of the genes encoding the large subunits. Allochromatium vinosum is a purple sulfur photosynthetic bacterium which contains at least one membrane-bound hydrogenase (MBH) (Bleijlevens et al. 2004) and one soluble hydrogenase (SH) (Minnan et al. 2007). The MBH with high hydrogen-uptake activity consists of a large (64kDa) and a small subunit (35kDa), and has been studied in detail as described recently (Bleijlevens et al. 2004). It contains two [4Fe–4S] clusters and one [3Fe–4S] cluster. In this study, we report the cloning and genetic deletion of the MBH gene. Analysis of the MBH-null bacteria shows that disruption of MBH significantly increases hydrogen production, likely through a decrease in hydrogen uptake by the cells."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Bacterial strains and cultivation,2.1 Bacterial strains and cultivation A. vinosum DSM 185 was routinely grown in Pfennig's minimal medium (Pfennig and Trüper 1992) supplemented with 4mmol/L sodium thiosulfate. The cells were cultivated anaerobically in a closed glass bottle under continuous illumination with a light intensity of 500W/m2 at 35°C for 1 week.
3,Preparation of genomic DNA,"2.2 Preparation of genomic DNA A. vinosum cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000g, 10min) and washed twice with NaCl solution (1mol/L). The cell paste was suspended in cold (4°C) TE buffer (10mmol/L Tris–HCl, 1mmol/L EDTA, pH 8.0) and kept in an ice-bath for 1h. Subsequently, the cells were incubated in lysis buffer (0.1mol/L Tris–HCl, 0.1mol/L EDTA, 1% lysozyme, pH 8.0) at 37°C for 20min. The mixture was then supplemented with RNase (100μg/ml), SDS (1%) and proteinase K (50μg/ml), and kept at 60°C for 1h. Finally, the lysate samples were extracted twice with phenol–chloroform–isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v), and with an equal volume of a mixture of chloroform–isoamyl alcohol (24:1, v/v). The genomic DNA was precipitated with ethanol and washed with 70% cold ethanol, followed by careful dissolution in TE buffer."
4,Analysis of N-terminal sequences of MBH,"2.3 Analysis of N-terminal sequences of MBH Purified MBH from A. vinosum was prepared as previously described (Bleijlevens et al. 2004). It was denatured and subjected to an SDS-PAGE. The protein bands were observed after Coomassie-brilliant blue staining, and the molecular weights determined. The proteins were then electroblotted onto a PVFM membrane with an electroblot instrument (Semi-dry transfer, Bio-Rad). N-terminal amino-acid analysis of the purified protein bands was performed by automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystem 470A gas-phase protein sequencer."
5,Cloning of hydSL genes,"2.4 Cloning of hydSL genes In the usual arrangement of typical hydrogenase structural genes, the gene encoding the small subunit is located upstream of the one encoding the large subunit. Primer hyd-SF (5′-CCSTCGGTCNTCTGGCTG-3′) corresponding to the N-terminal sequence (PSVIWL) of the small subunit, and primer hyd-SR (5′-GGTGAYSGGATCGACGAC-3′) corresponding to the N-terminal sequences (VVDPIT) of the large subunit were designed according to the codon usage of A. vinosum. The DNA fragment coding for the small subunit was amplified by standard PCR procedures (Sambrook and Russell 2001). The PCR fragments were then isolated from agarose gels and cloned into cloning vector pMD18-T. DNA sequencing was completed by the TaKaRa Biotechnology Company (Dalian, China). To obtain the complete sequence of the MBH-gene cluster, the genomic DNA was partial digested with restriction endonuclease BamHI. It was then ligated with an adaptor (5′-GATCAGCGGATAACAATTTCACAAG-3′) containing BamHI cohesive ends. To get the upstream sequence of the small subunit and the downstream sequence of the large subunit, PCR primers were designed according to the N-terminal sequences of the small or large subunits and the sequence of the adaptor, respectively. The ligation product was purified and used as the template of PCR. DNA sequencing of the double strands was performed by the TaKaRa Biotechnology Company (Dalian, China)."
6,Partial deletion of hydSL gene,"2.5 Partial deletion of hydSL gene To construct a plasmid for marker-exchange mutagenesis, the DNA fragment (683bp) homologous to hydS was cloned by PCR using the primer dHYD1 (5′-GACCATCTAGACCCTCGGTCGTCTGGCTGTCG-3′) and dHYD2 (5′-TTCGG GAATTCATGGTGGCGCAGGCGTTGTAG-3′). After double digestion with endonuclease XbaI and EcoRI, the fragments were cloned into pUC19 to generate pMDS. The DNA fragment (687bp) homologous to hydL was cloned similarly using the primer dHYD3 (5′-TGCAAAGCTTCAAGAATCCGCATCCGAAC-3′) and dHYD4 (5′-ACTTCTGCAGATCTTGCTCTCCAGGGCG-3′), and cloned into pMDS to generate pD-HYD (Figure 1 ). To obtain the hydSL deletion mutant, pD-HYD was digested with XbaI and transformed into A. vinosum by electroporation according to methods previously described (Kovács et al. 2002). Ampicillin-resistant mutants were screened and further analyzed by PCR and sequencing."
7,In vivo hydrogen production,"2.6 In vivo hydrogen production Cells of the initial and mutant strains were cultivated in a closed glass bottle under continuous illumination at 35°C for 1 week. They were then harvested by centrifugation (10,000g, 10min) and resuspended in fresh media containing 0.1mol/L glucose. The bacteria suspension were adjusted to OD600 1.0 and transferred into 120ml gas-tight vials at a volume 20ml. Three repetitive samples were set for each treatment. Oxygen in the vials was removed by repeated evacuation and flushing with argon. Finally, the vials were kept in the dark at 30°C. Gas samples (50μl) from the vial headspace were analyzed by gas chromatography (102G, Shanghai) every 8h. The cell dry weight (dw) was determined after centrifugating 200ml of culture (7000g, 10min), washing the pellets with deionized water, centrifuging again, followed by resuspending in a small volume of deionized water and drying at 103°C. One OD600 unit corresponded to 0.6g/L dry weight."
8,Results,
9,N-terminal sequence analysis of MBH,"3.1 N-terminal sequence analysis of MBH The purified MBH was denatured and subjected to an SDS-PAGE, two bands were observed after Coomassie-brilliant blue staining. The molecular mass of the two subunits were determined as approximately 65 and 35kDa, respectively. The N-terminal sequences of large subunit and small subunit were determined as “SEEIVVDPITRIEGH” and “SEQARRPSVIWLSFQE”, respectively."
10,Whole-length sequence of the MBH gene cluster,"3.2 Whole-length sequence of the MBH gene cluster The PCR primers hyd-SF and hyd-SR were synthesized according to the N-terminal sequences of the small and large subunits. As a result, the 1.1kb DNA fragments were amplified and cloned into pMD18-T. Sequence-BLAST results revealed that approximately 0.9kb DNA showed a high sequence similarity with those of the small subunits of other [NiFe]-hydrogenases. The remaining 0.2kb DNA sequence showed a high similarity with the isp1 gene sequences of hydrogenase I in Thiocapsa roseopersicina BBS (Rákhely et al. 1998). This indicates that the structure of the MBH-gene cluster in A. vinosum resembles that of the MBH (hydSL) in T. roseopersicina BSS in which hydS and hydL are separated by two intergenic sequences (IS) isp1 and isp2. To clone the IS and hydL genes, primer hyd-LF (5′-ATGGAATTTCTGCTCTGGAC-3′) based on the 1.1kb fragment sequence and the degenerate primer hyd-LR (5′-AGGGAAMGACTGSCTGGTAG-3′) were synthesized. As a result, a 3.5kb DNA fragment containing the MBH gene was amplified. It showed a high sequence similarity with the isp1, isp2 and partial hydL sequences in T. roseopersicina BSS. To obtain the whole MBH gene sequence of A. vinosum, the oligonucleotide adaptors containing BamHI were used to extend the upstream sequence of hydS and the downstream sequence of hydL. Adaptor F (GATCAGCGGATAACAATTTCACAAG) and adaptor R (CCTTGTGAAATTGTTATCCGCT) were first degenerated in TE buffer plus 50mmol/L NaCl, pH 8.0. The A. vinosum genomic DNA was digested with BamHI and ligated with the degenerated adaptors as PCR template. Adaptor R and uphyd-SR (5′-TCGAGGGCACCACGGCCTGGTAG-3′) were used to generate the sequence upstream of hydS; this resulted in a 0.75kb fragment containing the signal-peptide sequence. Adaptor R and downhyd-LF (5′-TCTACAAAGACTGGGGCGAGCG-3′) gave a 1.0kb fragment. Finally, the whole hydSL gene cluster was cloned and submitted to the NCBI/GenBank database (accession number AY741395)."
11,Gene structure of hydSL,"3.3 Gene structure of hydSL Sequence comparison analysis in GenBank database was carried out using the BLAST, BLASTX and BALTP programs (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The sequence of the A. vinosum MBH-gene cluster consists of four genes (4821bp; hydS–isp1–isp2–hydL). The individual genes encode proteins with 370 (HydS), 216 (Isp1), 421 (Isp2) and 576 (HydL) amino acids. Four overlapping nucleic acid bases were found between hydS and isp1, isp1 and isp2. The isp2 and hydL genes were separated by 60bp sequence. The hydS and hydL are separated by a 1913-bp intergenic sequence. Such an arrangement of [NiFe]hydrogenase structural genes is rather unusual. It only occurred in Escherichia coli and T. roseopersicina up to now. The Isp1 and Isp2 proteins showed 75% and 89% identity to the corresponding sequences in T. roseopersicina (Figure 2 )."
12,Hydrogen production of cells from the ΦhydSL mutant strain,"3.4 Hydrogen production of cells from the ΦhydSL mutant strain The recombinant suicide plasmid pD-HYD was transformed into the A. vinosum host cells through electroporation. The deletion mutant-strain ΦhydSL was constructed by homologous recombination. Under dark fermentative conditions, the hydrogen production reached a maximum after 24h for cells from both the initial and the mutant strains. The hydrogen-production activity of the mutant-strain cells was higher than that of cells from the initial strain. The hydrogen yield by mutant-strain ΦhydSL was 62% high than the initial strain after 72h (Figure 3 )."
13,Discussion,"The advantages of using biological systems to produce H2 are that they are flexible and can be adapted to various environments. Hydrogenase and nitrogenase are involved in the hydrogen metabolism of photosynthetic bacteria (Anastasios and Matthew 2006; Ilgi and Fikret 2006). Under photo-fermentative conditions, hydrogen production is associated mainly or completely with the action of nitrogenase: N2+8H++8e−+16ATP+16 H2O→2NH3+H2+16ADP+16Pi. This enzyme also catalyzes hydrogen production in the absence of molecular nitrogen: 2H++2e–+4ATP+4 H2O→H2+4ADP+4Pi. Under non-nitrogen-fixing conditions, hydrogen production is associated with the function of hydrogenase, 2H++2e↔H2. The presence of hydrogenase has been found to be a common feature of the photosynthetic bacteria (Rákhely et al. 2007). The membrane-bound hydrogenase preferentially works in the H2-uptake direction in vivo, while the cytoplasmic soluble hydrogenase is a bidirectional enzyme. By the use of DNA techniques, the electron flux was regulated directed to the H2-production hydrogenase. In this study, the fermentative hydrogen production of the MBH deletion mutant increased by 62% when the hydrogen-uptake system was disrupted by deletion of MBH genes. The result suggests that genetic engineering is a promising approach to improve the rate and yield of biological hydrogen production."
