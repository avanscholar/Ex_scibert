0,Introduction,"The world has recognized the pivotal role that H2 may play in future energy supply. To make the concept of “hydrogen economy” [1] a reality, innovation of technologies leading to sustainable, sufficient, and economically feasible production of H2 is extremely critical. Biological production of H2 is considered the most environmentally friendly route of producing H2. In particular, hydrogen production through light-dependent or independent fermentative conversion of organic substrates is of great interest, due to its dual function of waste reduction and clean energy production [2–4]. Dark fermentation involving mainly acidogenic bacteria (such as Clostridium sp.) produces H2 while converting organic substrates into volatile fatty acids and alcohols [3], which could be further mineralized by photosynthetic bacteria (e.g., purple nonsulfur bacteria), producing more H2 at the expense of photo energy [2,3]. Therefore, combination of dark and photo fermentation seems to be an ideal biohydrogen producing model leading to the highest theoretical H2 yield possible [5,6]. However, the economical feasibility of phototrophic H2 production appears to be limited by the poor H2 production rate of the photosynthetic bacteria, arising primarily from the low cell growth rate and the inefficient light energy utilization [3,7]. Thus, improving phototrophic H2 production rate would be a substantial step towards development of a successful H2 production process that integrates dark and photo fermentation. In this study, three strategies from biochemical and bioreactor engineering perspectives were applied to improve the performance of phototrophic H2 production with an indigenous purple nonsulfur photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris WP3-5 isolated from a wastewater treatment plant located in central Taiwan [8]. The first approach was to supplement selected porous solid carriers (such as activated carbon, silica gel, and clay) into fermentation broth to examine for the effect of carriers on phototrophic H2 production. These carriers were shown to be effective in stimulating cell growth and production of target metabolites (e.g., H2 and biosurfactant) in recent studies [9–12]. It is thought that the carriers can provide more surface attachment sites, enhancing biofilm formation [13] and granular sludge formation [9,14]. The solid carriers may also provide buffer capacity for extreme conditions such as high organic loadings, pH shock, etc. [13,15]. Moreover, similar to the function of immobilized cells, the carriers could enhance cell retention for continuous cultures, thereby avoiding wash-out of cells while operating at a high dilution rate (or a low hydraulic retention time) [16,17]. It has been reported that using immobilized R. palustris or cells of other photosynthetic bacteria could improve photo-hydrogen production [18–22]. However, for this photo-energy-dependent fermentation system, surface attachment seems to be a more reasonable cell immobilization approach than cell entrapment, because the efficiency of photo energy utilization is a crucial issue. The second strategy for performance improvement was to identify the best carbon substrate (acetate) concentration since the organic loading often plays a critical role in affecting the kinetics of catabolism. Acetate was selected as the carbon source because it is a major soluble metabolite from dark H2 fermentation, making it a perfect connection between dark and photo fermentation. In addition, effort was made on increasing the availability and utilization efficiency of light energy. The idea was to add an internal illumination system by direct insertion of optical fibers into the bioreactors. The effect of this innovative photobioreactor design on H2 production was investigated on batch and continuous modes. The objective of this work was to assess the effectiveness and feasibility of using the three proposed strategies (namely, carrier addition, carbon substrate optimization, and internal optical-fiber illumination) to improve the performance of phototrophic H2 production by R. palustris WP3-5."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganism and medium,"2.1 Microorganism and medium The phototrophic H2 producer used in this study was R. palustris WP3-5, which was isolated from a wastewater treatment plant in central Taiwan [8]. The culture medium for the strain consisted of (in g/l) acetate, 1000–4000 (mg COD/l; COD denotes chemical oxygen demand); glutamic acid, 0.4; K2HPO4, 0.5; KH2PO4, 0.5; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.2; NaCl, 0.4; CaCl2·2H2O, 0.05; yeast extract, 0.2; iron citrate solution (1.0g/l), 5ml/l; trace element solution, 1ml. The trace element solution contained (in mg/l) ZnCl2, 70; MnCl2·4 H2O, 100; H3BO3, 60; CoCl2·6H2O, 200; CuCl2·2H2O, 20; NiCl2·6 H2O, 20; NaMoO4·2H2O, 40; HCl (25%), 1ml/l. For continuous cultures, the feeding medium contained an acetate concentration of 1.0g/l. The anaerobic fermentation was carried out at 32°C and a light intensity of ca. 95W/m2 with the illumination of tungsten filament lamps. The initial pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.1 by 0.1N NaOH."
3,Solid carriers,"2.2 Solid carriers Three types of carriers were added into the fermentation culture to promote phototrophic H2 production. These carriers are activated carbon (AC), clay, and silica gel. The AC obtained from China Carbon, Inc. (Taipei, Taiwan) was of cylindrical shape with a diameter of 3–4mm and a height of 9mm. The clay carriers (expanded clay) obtained from Taihort Inc. (Taipei, Taiwan) were spherical particles with an average diameter of 5mm. Silica gel was obtained from Hsuan Chun Industrial Co., Tainan, Taiwan). The carriers were sterilized prior to use."
4,Setup and operation of photobioreactor,"2.3 Setup and operation of photobioreactor The photobioreactor (PBR) was a 1-l glass-made vessel equipped with side-light optical fiber (SLOF) and external light sources (100W tungsten filament lamps or 100W halogen lamp) (Fig. 1 ). The side-light optical fiber (SLOF) protected in a glass tube was immersed into the liquid medium inside the photo-bioreactor. Since the SLOF did not have direct contact with the medium, there was no need to autoclave the optical fibers prior to use. The SLOF was composed of a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) core coated with fluorinated alkyl methacrylate copolymer (diameter: 11mm, length: 25cm) obtained from Baycom Optic-Electronic Co. (Hsin-Chu, Taiwan). The protective cladding was removed by mechanical polishing, allowing direct light emission from the PMMA core (i.e., a side-light optical fiber). One of the two fiber-ends on which the light is incident was also polished to attain maximum light emission. Prior to installation inside the photobioreactor, the SLOF was physically polished until the desired light intensity and uniform light distribution were obtained. The PBR was illuminated with single or multiple light sources (e.g., optical fiber, tungsten filament lamp, halogen lamp), while the total light intensity for each illumination system was kept at ca. 95W/m2. After autoclave sterilization of the bioreactor, R. palustris WP3-5 cells were inoculated (10% inoculum) into the reactor containing 800ml of the culture medium mentioned earlier. Both batch and continuous cultures were performed at 32°C, pH 7.1, and 100rpm agitation with a working volume of 800ml. At the beginning of fermentation, three types of carriers (activated carbon, clay and silica gel) were added into the bioreactors at a weight to volume (w/v) ratio of 2%. This carrier loading (i.e., w/v ratio) was found to be suitable for carrier-assisted fermentation according to our recent findings [12]. A gas meter (Type TG1; Ritter Inc., Germany) was used to measure the amount of gas products generated and the gas volumes were calibrated to 25°C and 760mmHg. Gas samples were taken by gas syringe at desired time intervals to measure the gas composition. The liquid sample was also collected from the reactor as a function of time to determine cell concentration, pH and residual acetate concentration. For batch cultures, time-course data of cumulative H2 production were simulated by modified Gompertz equation (Eq. (1)) [23,24] to determine the kinetic parameters of photo-H2 production: (1) H = H max exp − exp R max e H max ( λ − t ) + 1 where H denotes cumulative H2 production (ml), H max denotes maximum cumulative H2 production (ml), R max denotes maximum H2 production rate (ml/h), t denotes culture time (h), and λ denotes the lag time required for the onset of H2 evolution (h). For continuous operation, batch cell growth was performed initially until reaching late exponential growth phase. The medium was then fed continuously at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 48h. After reaching steady state, the HRT of the continuous culture was shortened to 36h. The HRT is defined according to the following equation: (2) HRT = V F 0 where V is the working volume of the culture (ml) and F 0 is the volumetric feeding rate of the medium (ml/h)."
5,Estimation of light conversion efficiency,"2.4 Estimation of light conversion efficiency Light conversion efficiency (η) was defined as the efficiency by which the light energy can be transformed into H2 energy. The η value was calculated according to Eq. (3) [25,26]: (3) η ( % ) = H 2 output × H 2 energy content light energy input × 100 = 33.61 ρ H 2 V H 2 I A t × 100 where v H 2 is the volume of H2 produced (l), ρ H 2 is the density of H2 produced (g/l), I the light intensity (W/m2), A the irradiated area (m2), and t is the duration of H2 production (h). The light intensity (I) was measured with a LI-250 Light Meter (LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) that gave a unit of W/m2. The irradiation area of HL/TL and OF/HL/TL were 342 and 536cm2, respectively. The calculation of illuminated areas for the HL/TL was based on the illuminated surface of the culture in photo-bioreactor. After the liquid medium (800ml) was poured into the photobioreactor, the height of the liquid level (L) is measured. With the known diameter (d) of the cylindrical photobioreactor, the irradiation area of HL/TL (A i,HL/TL) was calculated by A i,HL/TL = π × d × L (Note that except for the illuminated surface, the rest of surface area on the photo-bioreactor was covered by aluminum foil). For optical fiber (OF) immersed into the medium, the irradiation area (A i,OF) was calculated by A i,OF = π × d OF × L OF, where d OF denotes the diameter of optical fiber and L OF presents the length of optical fiber that was in contact with liquid medium. The irradiation area of OF/HL/TL (A i,OF/HL/TL) was the combination of A i,HL/TL and A i,OF (i.e., A i,OF/HL/TL = A i,HL/TL + A i,OF)."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods Cell concentration of the culture was regularly monitored by measuring optical density at 660nm (i.e., OD660) using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer (model U-2001, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The cell dry weights were obtained by filtering 10ml aliquots of culture through a cellulose acetate membrane filter (0.45μm pore size, 47mm in diameter) and then the cell pellets were rinsed by deionized water to remove salts or non-cellular materials. Each loaded filter was dried at 105°C until the weight was invariant (about 72h). The dry weight of blank filter was subtracted from that of the loaded filter to obtain the dry cell weight (DCW). The OD660 value was converted to DCW concentration via proper calibration as 1.0 OD660 approximately equals 4.47g dry cell/l. Acetate concentration was determined by gas chromatography (GC-14B, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) using nitrogen as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 20ml/min. Samples were injected into a 15m long capillary column (Type no. 11052, Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA) with an internal diameter of 0.53mm. The temperature of injector and detector was set at 220 and 230°C, respectively. The oven temperature was initially set at 110°C, increased from 110 to 200°C at a rate of 8°C/min, and held at 200°C for 5min. Liquid samples were centrifuged (6000× g for 20min) and filtered (0.45μm membrane) prior to GC analysis. The gas products (H2 and CO2) were also analyzed by gas chromatography (Model 9800, China Chromatography, Taipei, Taiwan) using a thermal conductivity detector. The carrier gas was argon and the column (2.159mm in inner diameter and 4m in height) was packed with Porapak Q (China Chromatography, Taipei, Taiwan). The temperature at the column was initially set at 50°C, and then increased to 200°C at a rate of 30°C/min. The temperature at the injector was 140°C."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Effect of solid carriers on phototrophic H2 production,"3.1 Effect of solid carriers on phototrophic H2 production Our previous work showed that addition of an appropriate amount of solid carriers, such as activated carbon, expanded clay, etc., into fermentation broth could markedly stimulate cell growth and H2 production in dark fermentation [27]. This motivated us to examine whether adding carriers could also promote phototrophic H2 production by R. palustris WP3-5. A small amount (2% weight to volume ratio) of activated carbon (AC), silica gel (SG), and expanded clay (EC) was added into the medium containing an initial acetate concentration of 2000mg COD/l. Halogen and tungsten filament lamps were used as the external light sources giving a similar light intensity of ca. 95W/m2. The H2 production performance of the carrier-supplemented cultures is shown in Table 1 . Addition of clay and silica gel appeared to result in much better total H2 evolution, H2 production rate, H2 yield, and light conversion efficiency than those obtained from the control (carrier-free) culture. However, the AC-supplemented culture did not show significant improvement in the performance of H2 production. This is likely due to the higher cell density in the AC-supplemented culture (Table 1) and the tiny fragments flaking off the AC carriers, as both resulted in blocking of light penetration from the external light sources. This also reflects the poor light conversion efficiency (ca. 1.16%) in the AC-added culture (Table 1). The highest production rate (26.6ml/l/h) and yield (2.34mol H2/mol acetate) were obtained for cultures supplemented with clay and silica gel, respectively (Table 1). Also, according to the modified Gompertz equation (Eq. (1)), the R max (representing the kinetic characteristics of H2 production) was also higher for the culture with clay addition (37.9ml/h), slightly higher to 35.3ml/h for SG culture but much higher than 24.5ml/h for carrier-free culture (Table 1). To explore possible mechanism for carrier-enhanced H2 production, the morphology of carrier surface was monitored before and after fermentation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis shows that cells attached to the surface of the clay carriers to form biofilms (Fig. 2b). This suggests that the solid carriers may provide extra surface area for attached cell growth, and somehow led to an increase in H2 production. Similarly, recent studies showed that biofilm formation on carriers (e.g., activated carbon and silica gel) plays some roles in enhancing biosurfactant production from Bacillus subtilis [12] and Serratia marcescens [28]. Also, the cell growth rate increased when solid carriers were added, especially for using clay (Table 1). This is consistent with previous reports indicating that the solid carriers (such as silica gel and β-cyclodextrin) could be effective growth stimulants [28,29]. The detailed mechanism of the carrier-induced promoting effects on phototrophic H2 production has not yet been clearly identified and will be the focus of our future studies. During the course of batch fermentation, the pH did not vary significantly as it maintained within the range of 7.0–7.4 in all runs. These results indicate that addition of clay and silica gel could markedly enhance H2 production performance in all categories (Table 1). Therefore, the two carriers (EC and SG) were used for further investigation of the effect of acetate concentration on phototrophic H2 production."
9,Effect of acetate concentration on phototrophic H2 production,"3.2 Effect of acetate concentration on phototrophic H2 production Literature shows that the type and concentration of carbon substrate are critical factors affecting the fermentation kinetics of biohydrogen production [30]. The photosynthetic bacteria (such as R. palustris) possess the advantage of utilizing soluble metabolites generated from dark fermentation (mainly volatile fatty acids) to produce H2 at a high yield with a mark reduction of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the effluent of acidogenic H2-producing processes [31,32]. Therefore, in this study, one of the major soluble metabolites of dark H2 fermentation [3], acetate, was used as the sole carbon source for phototropic production of H2. The effect of acetate concentration on H2 production was examined in batch cultures containing different initial acetate concentrations (C HAc =1000–3000mg COD/l) with the addition of clay and silica gel as the carrier. External light sources (halogen and tungsten lamps) were used to illuminate the photo-bioreactor externally. The results are indicated in Fig. 3 and Table 2 . The cumulative H2 production (H max) appeared to increase with increasing acetate concentration from 1000 to 3000mg COD/l in all tests (Fig. 3a). This trend is quite reasonable as higher acetate (carbon substrate) loading usually leads to higher total production of H2 (H max) [30,31]. However, there is a different trend for the overall H2 production rate ( v H 2 ) (Fig. 3b) and H2 yield ( Y H 2 ) (Fig. 3c), as the v H 2 and Y H 2 values were similar for C HAc =1000 and 2000mg COD/l (slightly higher at 1000mg COD/l), but dropped significantly at 3000mg COD/l. The decrease in v H 2 and Y H 2 at higher C HAc (e.g., 3000mg COD/l) might be attributed to substrate inhibition, which was also observed in a similar study [30]. With regards to the light conversion efficiency (η) (Fig. 3d), the η value was essentially over 2.0% for cultures with silica gel and clay and did not vary significantly for C HAc =1000 and 2000mg COD/l. However, the η value decreased slightly at 3000mg COD/l due to poor H2 production at that acetate concentration. Despite following a similar trend to carrier-assisted cultures, the light conversion efficiency in carrier-free cultures was much lower than that obtained from cultures with carriers (Fig. 3d) due primarily to the less efficient H2-producing performance. Although the H2-producing performance of carrier-containing and carrier-free cultures had similar dependence on acetate concentration, addition of the carriers still gave higher H max, v H 2 , and Y H 2 values than the carrier-free runs. Comparison of the performance of the two carrier-assisted cultures shows that clay was a more effective carrier than silica gel (Fig. 3, Table 2). At C HAc =1000mg COD/l, the clay-supplemented culture gave the best v H 2 and Y H 2 of 28.5ml/l/h and 2.97mol H2/mol acetate (74.3%), respectively, higher than 24.8ml/l/h and 2.37mol H2/mol acetate, respectively, for the cultures with silica gel. Kinetic analysis with modified Gompertz equation also shows that the clay culture attained the highest R max of 41.8ml/h with at C HAc =1000mg COD/l, followed by 37.6ml/h for silica-gel culture and 31.8ml/h for carrier-free culture (Table 2). The foregoing discussion shows that addition of clay was a favorable way of promoting phototrophic production of H2. Under the optimal C HAc of 1000mg COD/l, the clay culture enabled a 36.4, 31.4, and 23.8% increase in v H 2 , R max, and Y H 2 , respectively, when compared to the control (carrier-free) runs. This indicates that the clay-assisted fermentation displayed superior H2-producing performance in terms of both kinetics (e.g., production rate) and thermodynamics (production yield)."
10,Effect of optical fiber on phototrophic H2 production,"3.3 Effect of optical fiber on phototrophic H2 production In the photobioreactors adopted to produce H2 from photosynthetic bacteria or green algae, conventional light sources, such as tungsten filament lamp, halogen lamp, and metal halide lamp, were often used as external light sources for the bioreactor [4,6,8,26,30]. However, the light intensity of these artificial light sources may decrease rapidly due to the shading effects arising from an increase in cell concentration and product formation and/or the growth of biofilm covering the vessel surface. This motivates us to explore better light sources (e.g. optical fibers) and illumination setup (e.g., internal irradiation) leading to higher phototrophic H2 productivity. The clay-supplemented cultures were used to investigate whether the H2 production performance of R. palustris WP3-5 can be further improved by applying more efficient illumination systems, in which self-prepared side-light optical fibers were used as the internal light source. With the same total light intensity (ca. 95W/m2) and initial acetate concentration (1000mg COD/l), the H2 producing performance was much enhanced due to integration of internal and external light sources (OF/HL/TL) regardless of carrier-added or carrier-free cultures (Fig. 4 ). Using the improved illumination system, the H2 production rate and yield increased 110 and 51.3%, respectively, for carrier-free cultures, and 54 and 23%, respectively, for carrier-added cultures (Table 2). However, the cell concentrations were only slightly increased ca. 6.66–7.15%. Although the OF/HL/TL system allowed marked improvement in H2 productivity of carrier-free cultures, the clay cultures still attained much better H2 producing performance than carrier-free runs, achieving an excellent v H 2 , R max, and Y H 2 values of 43.8ml/l/h, 57.7ml/h, and 3.63mol H2/mol acetate (90.8% of theoretical value), respectively (Table 2). The enhancing effect of the internal optical-fiber illumination mainly lies in providing more irradiation area as well as in providing more uniform and efficient light energy distribution and utilization. However, it is noted that the light conversion efficiency (η) resulting from OF/HL/TL system was 2.1 and 2.2% for carrier-free and clay-added cultures. These η values are only comparable or slightly higher than those obtained from cultures irradiated with the HL/TL system (Table 2). According to Eq. (3), the light conversion efficiency is positively dependent on H2 production rate ( v H 2 / t ) but inversely proportional to irradiation area (A). Hence, although using OF/HL/TL system resulted in higher H2 production rates, the light conversion efficiency was not increased as anticipated due to the higher irradiation area in the OF/HL/TL system. Nevertheless, when compared to cultures without carrier and optical fibers, combining internal illumination (with optical fibers) and carrier (clay) addition still substantially stimulated phototrophic H2 production of R. palustris WP3-5, elevating H2 production rate and yield from 20.9ml/l/h and 2.4mol H2/mol acetate, respectively, to 43.8ml/l/h and 3.63mol H2/mol acetate (Table 2)."
11,Stability of photo-H2 production during CSTR operations,"3.4 Stability of photo-H2 production during CSTR operations To assess the applicability of the phototrophic H2 production system, continuous culture was performed for a prolonged period of time under the optimal conditions discovered in the present work (i.e., C HAc =1000mg COD/l, carrier=clay, light source=OF/HL/TL). The continuous reactor was started up at 48h HRT, reaching a steady state within two days in terms of H2 production rate and yield (Fig. 5 ). At 48h HRT, the continuous culture gave a high H2 yield of 3.8mol H2/mol acetate and an average H2 production rate of 31.7ml/l/h. When the HRT was shortened to 36h, the system attained a higher steady-state v H 2 and Y H 2 value of 44.0ml/l/h and 3.6mol H2/mol acetate, respectively for an 8-day operation. Meanwhile, the cell concentration reached a nearly constant value of 6.13g/l and the light conversion efficiency was also stably maintained at a high value of 2.31% (Fig. 5). The H2 content in biogas was nearly constant at 88.1±2.9%. Although the conditions of the continuous culture have not yet been optimized, the resulting performance was still comparable or even slightly better than that for optimal batch runs (Table 2 and Fig. 5). This suggests that continuous cultures seem to be a more favorable choice of bioreactor strategy, having the potential to achieve higher H2 production with an excellent stability."
12,Performance assessment of the present phototrophic H2 production system,"3.5 Performance assessment of the present phototrophic H2 production system The gas products from batch and continuous cultures of R. palustris WP3-5 primarily consisted of H2 (85–91%) and CO2 (9–15%) (Table 2 and Fig. 5). The stable and high H2 content in the biogas could simplify the downstream H2 purification procedures and thus favors the H2 energy applications (e.g., fuel cells). Under the optimal operating conditions, the H2 yield obtained from batch and continuous operations was 3.63 and 3.44mol H2/mol acetate, respectively. These yields are 86–91% (Table 2 and Fig. 5) of the theoretical value (4.0mol H2/mol acetate) derived from Eq. (4) [6,31]: (4) CH3COOH+2H2O→4H2 +2CO2 The highest H2 yield (3.63mol H2/mol acetate) was obtained from batch culture with a C HAc of 1000mg COD/l, using clay carrier and OF/HL/TL light source. This yield appeared to be higher than most of the value reported in the literature (Table 3 ). Meanwhile, the aforementioned optimal operation conditions also gave a maximum volumetric H2 production rate of 43.8ml/l/h (Table 3), which is also much higher than previously reported values (Table 3). Moreover, the light conversion efficiency attained from the present photobioreactor systems was up to 2.34 and 2.31% for batch and continuous cultures, respectively, which are satisfactorily well and comparable to the values reported in the literature (Table 3). It is also observed that combination of clay and OF/HL/TL appeared to markedly increase both H2 production rate and production yield (Table 2). Meanwhile, the H2 yield ( Y H 2 ) and the photo-hydrogen production rate are two key parameters for bioreactor design and are the most important performance indexes for a bioH2-producing system [16,30]. The excellent Y H 2 and v H 2 obtained from our phototrophic H2 production system indicate the potential of applying this photobioreactor technology in degrading organic acids (such as acetate) from the effluent of acidogenic (dark) fermentation for high-yield production of H2 [5,6]."
13,Conclusions,"This study demonstrates that carbon substrate (acetate) concentration, carrier supplementation, and illumination system all played crucial roles in affecting the performance of phototrophic H2 production from an indigenous photosynthetic bacterium R. palustris WP3-5. Addition of clay carriers enhanced H2 production rate and yield by 67.2 and 37.2%, respectively when compared to the carrier-free culture. With the optimal acetate concentration (1000mg COD/l), supplying internal illumination by side-light optical fibers further improved v H 2 and Y H 2 to the best value of 43.8ml/l/h and 3.63mol H2/mol acetate, respectively, in a batch culture. Continuous operations were fairly stable and efficient, giving a v H 2 and Y H 2 value of 44.0ml/l/h and 3.56mol H2/mol acetate, respectively, while operating at 36h HRT. This performance is highly competitive to the results of comparable studies, indicating the potential of applying the developed photobioreactor system in phototrophic H2 production."
