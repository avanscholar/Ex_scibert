0,Introduction,"Microbial electrolysis is an upcoming technology which generates hydrogen from waste organic matter. The anode uses a microbial catalyst to break down the organic matter into electrons and protons, which are then combined at the cathode via application of an external voltage, to generate hydrogen. Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) have been used to treat a number of waste streams [1–5] generating hydrogen and potentially a cleaner water stream which can be reused or recycled [6,7]. Most studies use simple waste streams or simulated streams containing acetate as the feed. However, the number of studies using complex industrial waste streams has been rising steadily. For enabling commercialization of the MEC technology, utilization of real waste streams has to be demonstrated. These streams can contain complex organic matter requiring one or more break down steps to generate the substrate for exoelectrogenesis, which is usually acetate. Typical methods such as hydrolysis and/or fermentation are necessary to break down complex organic matter into substrates for exoelectrogens. Rezaei et al. used enzymatic hydrolysis to depolymerize cellulose in the bioanode [8]. Another study used a two-step fermentation prior to exoelectrogenesis to convert recalcitrant lignocellulosic materials into hydrogen [9]. Ki et al. have used a pulsed electric field to degrade primary sludge to improve energy recovery from a sludge stream [10]. More recently, the use of integrated systems or single reactors to achieve conversion of complex organic matter into electrons has been reported [2,11,12]. The MEC technology has made steady progress in achieving high productivity and efficiency in converting simple as well as complex substrates [5,13,14]. A maximum hydrogen production rate of 50 L/L-day has been reported with acetate [15], while up to 11.7 L/L-day has been reported using complex substrate mixtures [16,17]. Maximum hydrogen recovery from acetate in MECs has been reported to be 91% [18], while that using complex substrates has ranged from 10 to 77% [11,14]. Biomass can be a potential source of complex substrates for MEC. One of the pathways for conversion of biomass to advanced biofuels is via catalytic pyrolysis [19]. The process generates two liquid products, an aqueous and an organic fraction. The organic phase is a bio-oil, which is hydrotreated to generate hydrocarbon fuels and the aqueous phase is typically treated as a waste, since it cannot be used for fuel production [20]. However, this catalytic pyrolysis aqueous phase (CPAP) can contain up to 20% of the carbon fed into the pyrolysis process [21]. Thus, valorization of the CPAP can lead to improved economic feasibility for the process. Use of an aqueous phase from intermediate pyrolysis has been reported previously [14], however, the use of CPAP in an MEC has not been reported in the literature to the best of our knowledge. Other reports on use of biomass and biorefinery waste streams with high chemical oxygen demand (COD) as a source of renewable hydrogen production also exist [13] [9] [14,22], [23]. The reports indicate potential for this technology to serve as an important contributor in renewable hydrogen production from biomass. For enabling use of solid biomass as a feedstock in MEC, its liquefaction or extraction into an aqueous phase is necessary. This can be achieved thermochemically or biochemically, using pyrolysis or enzymatic hydrolysis, respectively. In the latter approach, lignin is usually separated as a solid fraction and represents another waste stream, however, in the pyrolysis approach, it is transformed into a bio-oil which serves as a substrate for production of hydrocarbon fuels. The pyrolyzed carbohydrates associated with the bio-oil are highly water soluble and remain associated with the aqueous phase, either emulsified with the bio-oil or resulting in a separate aqueous phase. During catalytic pyrolysis, oxygen is partly removed from the biomass as water, which results in separation of an aqueous phase containing depolymerized carbohydrates and their degradation byproducts [24], while thermal fast pyrolysis results in a single product which is an emulsified oil containing water soluble compounds [25]. This emulsified bio-oil can be separated into aqueous and organic fractions [26] or utilized wholly for biofuel production [27]. Utilization of the separate aqueous phase generated via thermal fast pyrolysis of switchgrass in a MEC was recently demonstrated [14]. This aqueous phase contained a wide range of compounds including carboxylic acids, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, sugar derivatives, furanic and phenolic compounds [25]. The aqueous phase generated via catalytic pyrolysis contains a larger fraction of phenolic compounds which have been reported to be inhibitory to certain exoelectrogens [28]. The concentration at which inhibition becomes a problem is relatively high (>0.8 g/L), thus, dilute streams can be processed in MEC with minimal inhibition as demonstrated for aqueous streams derived from switchgrass within a recycle loop [11]. Steam reforming of pyrolysis aqueous phase has been reported extensively in the literature using chemical catalysts. In comparison to microbial electrolysis which is also a form of reforming occurring at ambient temperatures, the catalytic steam reforming requires much higher temperatures in the range of 650 °C–750 °C [29,30]. Coking is a significant issue at lower temperatures (∼600 °C) and can lead to catalyst deactivation within a few hours [24,29,31]. Single substrate studies show that levoglucosan, guaiacol and furans have high tendency to form coke [32]. Furthermore, simpler molecules such as acetic acid are also affected by the other molecules reducing conversion in the presence of the other substrates [31]. A recent study by Paasikallio et al. reported high yields of hydrogen at 650 °C using pyrolysis aqueous phase from fast pyrolysis of pine sawdust, however, the experiments only studied a short run time of 2 h [24]. Developing a catalyst capable of minimizing coking and extending half-life as well as achieving high process and energy efficiency are challenges that this technology has to overcome to enable commercialization. The work described here investigates hydrogen production via microbial electrolysis from a catalytic pyrolysis aqueous phase (CPAP) generated from pine sawdust. The conversion of various classes of compounds, including carboxylic acids, anhydrosugars, furanic and phenolic compounds present in the CPAP was studied. In addition, characterization of effluent streams obtained from MECs treating switchgrass-derived bio-oil aqueous phase (BOAP) was also conducted to compare with the CPAP results. The performance of the MEC is reported in terms of current density, anode and cathode efficiency and hydrogen productivity. Utilization of the aqueous phase for hydrogen production can minimize the loss of carbon and energy and reduce the need for hydrogen sourcing via fossil fuels."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Catalytic pyrolysis of pine sawdust,"2.1 Catalytic pyrolysis of pine sawdust The feedstock for catalytic pyrolysis was pine sawdust, which was processed in VTT's 20 kg/h circulated fluid bed (CFB) pyrolysis pilot unit. The experiments generated a separate aqueous phase, which was collected and provided by VTT/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The details of the catalytic pyrolysis experiments have been reported previously [33]. Briefly, a HZSM5 catalyst was used in a catalytic fluidized bed reactor unit operating at 520 °C. The catalyst to biomass ratio was 7:1 wt basis. The aqueous product was separated from the organic phase after the experiment [33]."
3,MEC construction and experimental setup,"2.2 MEC construction and experimental setup Two replicate MECs were constructed using Lexan and PVC enclosures with anode and cathode volumes of 16 ml each and a projected area of 12.56 cm2. Carbon felt was used as the anode material and Pt-deposited carbon was the cathode material. Nafion 115 was used as a membrane separator between the anode and cathode chambers, with the catalytic carbon pressed on to it on the cathode side. A carbon rod and stainless steel wire were used as current collectors in the anode and cathode chambers, respectively. Additional details of the MEC construction are reported elsewhere [11]."
4,Bioanode development,"2.3 Bioanode development An anode biofilm developed previously using a bio-oil aqueous phase (BOAP) generated from pyrolysis of switchgrass as the substrate was used in this study [14]. It was acclimated to the CPAP for a period of three weeks with addition of substrate at an organic loading rate of 2 g/L-day. The process included a change of the nutrient medium when the MEC effluent cell density increased above an optical density of 0.05, measured at 600 nm as reported previously [34]. During the change of the anode medium, the anode chamber was flushed with freshly prepared, nitrogen-sparged nutrient medium to remove planktonic cells, and enrich an electroactive biofilm as described previously [34,35]. After the acclimation period, the experiments to determine the effect of loading rate and other parameters were conducted under continuous and batch operation conditions."
5,Continuous and batch MEC operation,"2.4 Continuous and batch MEC operation The MEC anodes utilized a flow-through design, with the anode liquid continuously recycled via a feed reservoir [11]. Two types of substrate delivery conditions were studied: continuous substrate delivery and fed-batch addition. For the former experiments, the organic loading rate was studied over the range of 2–50 g COD/L-anode volume per day. The substrate was added via a syringe pump into the flow line entering the anode (Fig. 1 ). These experiments lasted from 24 to 48 h, after which liquid samples were taken from the anode reservoir to determine residual COD and individual compound concentrations via high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The hydrogen gas was collected in the cathode chamber connected to an inverted cylinder filled with water, such that the water column exerted a slight negative pressure on the cathode chamber connected to the cylinder headspace to facilitate hydrogen collection. The anode liquid was recirculated at a flow rate of 3.6 ml/min. The feed reservoir was replaced with fresh media for each experiment and the circulation lines and anode chamber were flushed so that all substrate remaining from the previous experiment is removed from the whole system. The cathode buffer was not circulated and was replaced before each experiment. The experiments were conducted by poising the anode potential at −0.2 V vs Ag/AgCl via a Reference 3000 potentiostat (Gamry Instruments, Warminster PA). A fed-batch experiment was conducted by introducing CPAP into the anode reservoir at a concentration of 0.5 g/L. Samples were collected from the anode after 24 h of batch operation."
6,Analysis and calculations,"2.5 Analysis and calculations High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) analysis were conducted to measure the extent of conversion of the substrates in CPAP. The HPLC analysis was done using two detectors: a photodiode array (PDA) detector and a refractive index (RI) detector (Jasco, 2000Plus, Jasco analytical instruments). The RI chromatogram was used to quantify carboxylic acids and anhydrosugars. The PDA detector was used to quantify the rest of the compounds resolved on the chromatogram. In addition to CPAP, samples from switchgrass-derived BOAP treated in MEC under similar conditions were also examined for comparison with the CPAP results [11]. The removal rates for individual compounds were determined for the continuous substrate delivery experiments by subtracting the amount of substrate remaining at the end of experiment from the amount delivered over the course of the experiment. At the end of each run gas samples for GC analysis were taken from the cathode outlet to confirm hydrogen production. All sampling procedures and analyses were carried out as previously described [14]. Performance and conversion efficiency were characterized by anode Coulombic efficiency (CE), cathodic conversion efficiency (CCE), hydrogen recovery (HRE), and were calculated as given below [14,36]. C E a n o d e = I o b s t n s n e F Where, I o b s , is the current produced, ns is the moles of substrate used and n e , is the number of electrons available per mol of substrate (based on complete conversion to CO2). F is Faraday constant and t is the duration of the experiment. Percent hydrogen yield was calculated as moles of hydrogen produced per mole of hydrogen expected from conversion of substrate utilized in the anode. The analysis was based on COD measurements at the end of each experiment using a HACH COD analysis kit (Product # 2125915). Y H 2 = P V H 2 / R T 2 Δ n C O D Where, P is the atmospheric pressure, VH2 is the volume of hydrogen produced, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin and ΔnCOD is the moles of COD consumed during the experiment. Cathodic conversion efficiency (CCE) was calculated as the ratio of the amount of hydrogen produced and the maximum amount of hydrogen that could be produced based on the average current generated over the experiment, I o b s . This was calculated by the following equation: C E c a t = ( V H 2 I o b s t R T 2 F P )"
7,Results and discussion,
8,Generation of catalytic pyrolysis aqueous phase,"3.1 Generation of catalytic pyrolysis aqueous phase The aqueous phase was generated by VTT's catalytic pyrolysis process using HZSM-5 as reported previously [33]. The aqueous phase used in this work was separated from the organic phase in a big container. Phase separation took place spontaneously, because the organic phase was less polar than what is typically observed for non-catalytically produced oils. The water content of the aqueous phase was 67.7 wt%, whereas the organic phase contained 8.3 wt% of water."
9,Characterization of catalytic pyrolysis aqueous phase,"3.2 Characterization of catalytic pyrolysis aqueous phase The CPAP was highly concentrated and contained 509 g COD/L. A carbon analysis indicated that the total carbon in the sample was about 155 ± 0.9 mg/g CPAP. An HPLC analysis of the pine-derived CPAP and the switchgrass-derived BOAP was conducted to quantify 18 compounds. The total contribution of the compounds represented by the peaks quantified via HPLC was 25.9 g/L for the CPAP and 50.3 for the BOAP. This was relatively low compared to the total organics present, therefore the conversion of the substrate fed into the MEC was followed using COD analysis to determine overall conversion. The compounds identified by HPLC were also tracked post-MEC treatment and their conversion rates are discussed below."
10,H2 production from catalytic pyrolysis aqueous phase,"3.3 H2 production from catalytic pyrolysis aqueous phase The current density generated by the MEC using CPAP as a substrate ranged from 2.3 to 6.8 A/m2 (Fig. 2 A). The hydrogen production increased with the organic loading rate (OLR) reaching a maximum of 5.8 ± 0.17 L-H2/L-anode volume-day at an OLR of 50 g/L-day. The productivity increased linearly only until an OLR of 10 g/L-day (Fig. 2B inset). A productivity of 2.7 ± 0.11 L/L-day was obtained at an OLR of 10 g/L-day, which is relatively high compared to studies conducted with other wastewater streams [37]. Maximum hydrogen productivities reported previously using complex wastewater substrates have been on the order of 1–2 L/L-day. A fermented molasses wastewater stream was reported to achieve a productivity of 1.41 L/L-day [38], while a fermented waste activated sludge stream resulted in 1.7 L/L-day [39]. Both the studies were conducted at a high substrate concentration with the starting COD being 3.25 g/L and 6.4 g/L, respectively. The COD concentration used in the experiment reported here was 0.026 g/L, which was fed continuously at a loading of 2–50 g/L-day. The OLR of 50 g/L-day was inferred to be higher than the capacity of the anode to convert into current, since the current density did not increase linearly above the OLR of 10 g/L-day. At this loading rate, the hydrogen productivity was likely limited by parameters other than substrate availability. Biomass-derived streams have been used previously in MECs for hydrogen production. A pre-treatment or pre-conversion step is usually necessary for producing hydrogen from biomass. In this study, no external pre-treatment was included. The pre-treatment steps reported in the literature include hydrolysis, biological treatment or a thermochemical treatment [8,9,14]. The hydrolysis can be via use of a chemical or an enzymatic process. The deconstruction of the biomass polymers can be followed by direct use in the MEC or by further splitting of the conversion into dark fermentation and exoelectrogenesis. Both approaches have been investigated. Lalaurette et al. has reported a two-step process using a fermentation step prior to MEC [9]. The dark fermentation step yields hydrogen, however, it is limited by thermodynamics and can result in a maximum of 33% yield. Thus, only 4 mol of hydrogen can be derived from 1 mol of glucose via dark fermentation, although the practical yields are much less [40]. Treatment of dilute-acid pretreated corn-stover via the two-step process was reported to result in a hydrogen production rate of 0.25 L/L-day in the fermentation step and 1 L/L-day in the MEC step [9]. Direct use of cellulose in MEC has not been reported, but its use in a microbial fuel cell has been reported [41]. An integrated process combining dark fermentation, MFC, and MEC has been reported using cellulose as the substrate for dark fermentation, achieving a rate of 0.48 L/L-day [42]. A twelve-fold higher hydrogen productivity was achieved in the MEC in this study using a pyrolysis-derived stream generated from pine-wood. Similar results have been reported with switchgrass treated via intermediate pyrolysis. A maximum hydrogen productivity of 4.3 L/L-day was reported using a switchgrass-derived bio-oil aqueous phase [14]. Conversion of organic acids, anhydrosugars as well as furanic and phenolic compounds has been demonstrated using the MEC process with a thermochemical pretreatment [14,43]. These results demonstrate that it is possible to produce hydrogen from not only the cellulosic sugars but also from hemicellulose and lignin-depolymerization products derived from lignocellulosic feedstocks, via use of the thermochemical pre-treatment. This method can result in utilization of all the biomass polymers for hydrogen production in a two-step process consisting of pyrolysis and microbial electrolysis. The anode and cathode efficiency for the MEC are plotted in Fig. 3 A and B. The anode coulombic efficiency decreased with increasing organic loading indicating that an upper limit existed in the ability of the anode consortium to convert the substrate effectively into electrons. While the current density increased with loading, the formation of byproducts such as cell biomass etc. may have resulted in decreased coulombic efficiency. A 5-fold increase in loading from 2 to 10 g/L-day only increased the current production by about 1.8 fold. The increase in loading did not reduce the COD uptake. As shown in Table 1 , the percent COD removal was close to 60% for all conditions, except at the lowest loading of 2 g/L-day. This indicates that the conversion was limited by exoelectrogenesis, and utilization of the CPAP by fermentation and other pathways continued. The cathode conversion efficiency on the other hand, increased with loading from 31 ± 4.1% to a maximum of 89 ± 1.4%. The low efficiencies at the lower loading are a consequence of the mode of operation of the MECs, which was operated by poising the anode potential vs. setting the cell potential. At low organic loading, lower current densities are obtained, as observed in Fig. 2A. Under a set-anode-potential mode of operation, the cathode potential depends on the current density of the MEC. At low loadings, the electrons transferred from the anode to the cathode via the external circuit are relatively less, which results in a lower cathode potential. The rate of transfer of electrons increases with the loading, consequently increasing the cathode potential. This was observed in the experiments reported in this study. As the loading was increased from 2 to 6 g/L-day, the cathode potential increased from −1.205 to −1.274 V vs. the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The effect of cell potential, which is directly related to cathode potential, on cathode efficiency has been reported in the literature [44]. As the cell potential is increased, cathode efficiency increases. The efficiency of conversion of the electrons to hydrogen was much higher at the more negative cathode potentials realized at higher loadings. The hydrogen recovery is a measure of the extent of the energy recovered as hydrogen from the substrate provided. For the CPAP, this was relatively constant at about 30% for the loading rates up to 10 g/L-day (Fig. 4 ). In the batch experiment, however, the hydrogen recovery was 56 ± 7% (Table 2 ). The higher recovery in the batch experiment may be due to the relatively high anode and cathode conversion efficiencies. Since hydrogen recovery is a function of both, anode and cathode performance, a low efficiency for either of the two electrodes results in lower hydrogen recovery. In the continuous feeding experiments, a high anode coulombic efficiency was observed at the low loading of 2 g/L-day, however, the cathode efficiency under these conditions was low. On the flip side, at a loading of 10 g/L-day, the anode efficiency was low but the cathode efficiency was higher. In comparison to steam reforming, the hydrogen recovery obtained using the MEC process is higher. Hydrogen yield is the term used for the steam reforming process, which is equivalent to the hydrogen recovery for the MEC process reported here. Oasmaa et al. have reported the hydrogen yield for steam reforming of bio-oil aqueous phase to be about 12–13% [29]. They report that the presence of sugar and other higher molecular weight compounds in the BOAP results in coking and limits the yield of hydrogen. Use of a higher ratio of steam:carbon above 8 is necessary to reduce coke formation and to achieve this yield. One approach that has been implemented recently is to use a fraction with lower fraction of sugar-type compounds obtained by volatility-based fractionation of pyrolysis products [24]. It has enabled a yield as high as 81% over an operating period of 2 h, however, increase in throughput was reported to drop the yield at the rate of 10% every hour. Thus, significant challenges exist in achieving long-term stability of the steam reforming process."
11,Conversion of phenolic substrates,"3.4 Conversion of phenolic substrates The pine-derived CPAP contained several phenolic compounds. These compounds were classified into three categories: the monophenols, diols and alkylphenols. Another group of phenolic compounds, alkoxyphenols, which are typically observed as lignin-degradation products, were essentially absent from the CPAP. Akloxyphenols have been reported in the product profile of fast and intermediate pyrolysis processes. For instance, bio-oil aqueous stream generated from swichgrass via the intermediate pyrolysis process has been reported to contain a number of these compounds [25]. Fig. 5 shows the rate of conversion of the different type of phenolic compounds for two different feedstocks, pine derived CPAP and switchgrass-derived BOAP. The alkylphenols identified in CPAP included 2-ethylphenol and 2-methyl-4-methylphenol, however, their concentration was very low in the process samples used in this study to quantify them accurately. The concentration of the alkoxyphenols in a stream derived from catalytic pyrolysis may be due to the removal of methoxy groups during the catalytic process [45]. Conversion of the individual phenolic compounds was investigated in the MEC at OLRs from 2 to 6 g/L-day. Rate of conversion of phenol present in CPAP at an OLR of 2 g/L-day was found to be 88.6 ± 0.3 mg/L-anode-day (referred to as mg/L-day, henceforth). The rate of removal of phenol increased with OLR and reached a maximum of 116 ± 5.1 mg/L-day at an OLR of 6 g/L-day. Rate of conversion of 1,2-benezenediol in the CPAP experiments ranged from 33.8 to 61 mg/L-day. The rate of conversion of the phenolic compounds using switchgrass-derived substrate was comparatively lower, since the concentration of these compounds in the BOAP was comparatively lower. Using switchgrass-derived BOAP, the rate of conversion of phenol was 9 mg/L-day, while that for 1,2-benezenediol was 18 mg/L-day. Phenol was present at 0.18% in the BOAP, while it was present at 2.2% in the CPAP. The level of 1,2-benezenediol was 0.54% in BOAP and 2% in CPAP. Thus, the rate of removal appears to be directly related to the concentration of these substrates supplied in the anode stream. Removal of alkoxyphenols was demonstrated using the switchgrass-derived BOAP, but they were essentially absent from the CPAP feedstock (Fig. 4). The individual compounds present in this group included guaiacol, vanillic acid, 2-methoxyphenol, and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol [25]. The CPAP contained alkylphenols and while they were not observed in the MEC effluent, their removal cannot be conclusively stated because of the low concentrations achieved under the loading conditions used in this study. Supplemental Figure S1 shows a chromatogram of the CPAP analysis by HPLC comparing MEC effluent and untreated CPAP, showing the definitive removal of phenol and 1,2-benezenediol. Time course experiments investigating conversion of BOAP (data now shown) indicates fluctuations in the concentration of 1,2-benezenediol in the anode effluent and accumulation in some experiments. This is not unexpected because it has been found to be an intermediate of vanillic acid (VA) degradation in the MEC [46]. VA is a dihydroxybenzoic acid derivative, which has been reported to degrade via loss of its acid group, generating 1,2-benezenediol [43]. Many other monomethoxy and dimethoxy-phenolic compounds are present in the BOAP [25]. Thus, it is likely that 1,2-benezenediol (as well as phenol) are being generated from other compounds present in the BOAP, resulting in variation in their concentration over time as the conversion rate of the compounds peaks and subsequently falls. A net removal of the diol as well as the phenol was observed in this study, indicating the potential of the microbial consortium to remove the phenolic compounds. Further work is necessary to determine the metabolic path used for conversion of these compounds."
12,Removal of carbonyl compounds,"3.5 Removal of carbonyl compounds The CPAP and BOAP contain a range of carbonyl compounds including furanic compounds, aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids. Furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) are the major furanic aldehydes present, which were removed at the rate of 1.6–2.2 mg/L-day and 4.9–5.6 mg/L-day, respectively (Fig. 5). The low rate of removal was due to the relatively low level of these compounds in the CPAP (<0.2 wt%). The switchgrass-derived BOAP, however, contained 1.27% furfural and 1.55% HMF. The rate of removal was correspondingly higher with BOAP as the substrate: 26 mg/L-day and 31 mg/L-day, respectively. The ketone present in the CPAP included 2(5H) furanone, which was removed at the rate of 6.9–9.6 ± 0.3 mg/L-day. Its rate of removal with BOAP as the substrate was 28.7 mg/L-day. Additional ketones were also present in BOAP including cyclohexanone and 3-methyl-1,2-cyclopentanediol, however, their removal could not be quantified due to the low levels present in BOAP. Two major carboxylic acids were present in the feedstocks: acetic acid and propionic acid. The maximal rate of removal of acetic acid with CPAP as the substrate was 284.7 ± 9.9 mg/L-day, while it was 265 mg/L-day with BOAP as the substrate. The corresponding rates for propionic acid were 78.9 ± 7.4 mg/L-day and 156 mg/L-day, respectively. The large difference was due to the lower level of propionic acid in the CPAP (1.8 wt%), vs. 7.7 wt%. in BOAP. Finally, the removal rate of levoglucosan ranged from 536 ± 54 mg/L-day to 737 ± 48 mg/L-day with CPAP, while it was 334 mg/L-day with BOAP as the substrate at an OLR of 2 g/L-day. Table 3 shows the percent removal of the various compounds present in the CPAP at three different loading rates. At lower loading, 100% removal was observed for most of the compounds. 1,2-benezenediol was an exception, which showed incomplete removal. This may be due to its continued production from other phenols present in CPAP, as demonstrated from pure substrate studies [43]. In comparison to steam reforming of BOAP, the substrate conversion rates are much lower for the MEC process, however, as mentioned earlier, the problem of coke formation is a major hurdle for the steam reforming process [29]. Studies with individual furanic and phenolic compounds have been reported using the steam reforming process, which show that these compounds lead to carbon deposition at the rate of 7 and 73.5 mg/gcat-h, respectively with model compounds furfural and guaiacol [32]. A potential solution investigated to reduce coking was the use of oxygen along with steam in the reforming process, which reduced the deposition rate, but decreased the yield of hydrogen [32]. Optimization of the steam reforming process has been investigated via a number of approaches, but no good solution has been identified as of yet [32,47]."
13,Future perspective – integrating bioelectrochemical systems into biorefineries,"3.6 Future perspective – integrating bioelectrochemical systems into biorefineries This work demonstrates the proof of principle for hydrogen production from the CPAP via use of microbial electrolysis. In order to consider its use in biorefineries, operation of the MEC at larger scales is necessary. Additionally, it will be important to show stability of the process over several days to weeks demonstrating effective management of the potentially inhibitory compounds such as phenols. Long term operation can lead to accumulation of these compounds in the recycle stream affecting performance of the MEC. It is important to understand the pathway for conversion of these compounds, so a cost-effective process can be designed. The production of hydrogen from the CPAP via the bioelectrochemical approach can lead to increased yield of fuels and chemicals from biomass in a biorefinery. Fig. 6 shows a conceptual flow chart for integrating MECs into the biorefinery process flow to generate hydrogen from the aqueous stream generated during pyrolysis. The hydrogen can be used for hydrotreatment or sold as a separate product, potentially improving the economics and sustainability of the process, either via increased revenue for the biorefinery or via reduced hydrogen sourcing from fossil fuels."
14,Conclusions,"Aqueous phase generated from catalytic pyrolysis of pine sawdust was used for investigating hydrogen production via microbial electrolysis. An electroactive bioanode developed using switchgrass pyrolysis aqueous phase was used for biological conversion of the CPAP. MEC performance was investigated at an organic loading ranging from 2 to 50 g/L-day. A maximum hydrogen productivity of 5.8 ± 0.18 L/L-day was obtained, however, the productivity increased linearly only up to a loading rate of 10 g/L-day. The highest current density achieved was 6.8 ± 0.1 A/m2. The efficiency of conversion of the CPAP to current in the anode decreased with increasing loading, but the maximum Coulombic efficiency was 98 ± 0.04%. The cathode efficiency on the other hand, increased with loading up to a maximum of 89 ± 1.4%. Total hydrogen recovery was relatively constant for most runs at 30%, except at the highest loading rate, however, the operation of the MEC under batch mode resulted in a hydrogen recovery of 63 ± 4%. Hydrogen production via MEC has potential advantages over the steam reforming process in terms of reducing coking, however, the productivity of hydrogen may need to be improved further to enable economic feasibility. Demonstration of management of the inhibitory compounds will be essential during long term operation of the MEC for development of a stable, continuous process. This may be possible if the mechanism of the bioconversion process is better understood. The results demonstrate potential for hydrogen recovery from a pyrolysis waste stream which can improve the total biofuel or energy recovery from the biorefinery."
