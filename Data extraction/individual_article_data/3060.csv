0,Introduction,"Molecular hydrogen derived from renewable sources is a potentially valuable alternative to fossil fuels. Two biological technologies known to yield maximum rates of H2 production are (a) photoproduction by purple photosynthetic bacteria, requiring light energy and simple organics as reductants and (b) dark, fermentative H2 production by acidogenic bacteria [1–3]. However, both have drawbacks. In the case of purple bacterial H2 photoproduction, one of the key issues is the source of organic acids. Pure organic acids are very expensive for use in H2 production. On the other hand, organic wastes are not pure chemicals and are thus inexpensive, but they contain, in addition to organic acids, other materials such as starch and cellulose, which cannot be metabolized by purple bacteria. With acidogenic, fermentative H2 production, organic pollutants are first converted to fatty acids, which are then further metabolized to acetate and H2. Instead of following this by methane production, as in conventional anaerobic treatment processes, many reports describe processes that stop at acidogenic H2 production, do not generate methane, but do produce organic acids [4]. However, these processes cannot, even theoretically, yield more than 4mol of H2 per mole of glucose, a major disadvantage in terms of efficient H2 production. One of the ways to avoid the drawbacks of these processes is to integrate them into a single process [5,6], so that dark acidogenic fermentation will produce H2 and organic acids, and purple bacteria will then utilize the organic acids for H2 photoproduction. In an optimized process, it should be possible, in principle, to obtain high H2 output simultaneously with waste treatment of contaminated water. However, before integrating these two processes, it is important that both be independently optimized. In our previous paper, we reported results on the study of bacterial H2 photoproduction using artificial effluent from a dark, acidogenic reactor [2]. In the current study, we report on optimization of dark, acidogenic fermentation, focused on identifying and eliminating factors from the fermentative effluent that may inhibit subsequent purple bacterial H2 photoproduction."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Development of microbial consortia,"2.1 Development of microbial consortia The starting microbial consortia for our experiments were developed as follows. Sludges from different sources (Oka river mud, meadow grass rhizosphere, meadow flower rhizosphere, cultured flower rhizosphere, damaged potato, silo pit liquid, Kaluga town garbage dump site drainage water, cardboard hydrolyzing bacterial consortia) were diluted 1:10 (without any pre-treatment) in base medium (0.9gL−1 NaCl, 0.2gL−1 MgCl2, 0.1gL−1 CaCl2, 1gL−1 NH4Cl, 1.3gL−1 K2HPO4, 1.5gL−1 KH2PO4, 0.3gL−1 cysteine, 5.0gL−1 peptone (triptone), 10.0–30.0gL−1 food quality potato starch (unless otherwise stated, bought at a local grocery store), 10mlL−1 microelements [7], and 5.0mgL−1 vitamins [7] at an initial pH 6.8–7.4) and incubated at 37 or 55°C under anaerobic conditions (N2 atmosphere). Since the starch used as the substrate is not water soluble, we pre-treated it by first dispersing it in cold water, then injecting the material into boiling water (the ratio of cold substrate to boiling water was 1:3), and finally mixing it with a glass rod for 30–60s. The cultures resulting from these initial cultivations were used in seven successive batch cycles (1% inoculum in base medium, 4–7 days per cycle), yielding final cultures that were then used as inocula for all the reported experiments."
3,Cultivation and gas production measurements,"2.2 Cultivation and gas production measurements In most experiments, batch cultures were grown in 250-ml capped glass flasks containing 150ml of base medium and 0.3% inoculum from Section 2.1. Inocula were pre-treated at 100°C for 10min to suppress H2-consuming bacterial and methanogenic activities [8,9]. Each flask was then purged with nitrogen to ensure anaerobic conditions, and incubated at either 37 or 55°C for up to 12 days. Daily titrations with 50% KOH (w/v) were carried out to maintain the pH above 5.0 (unless otherwise stated). The gas phase and liquid medium were each sampled twice a day. Culture growth was recorded as the optical density at 600nm. Biogas production was recorded using the gas–water displacement method and computerized weighting of the water [10]. The percentage of H2 was analyzed by GC as described earlier [2]. The CO2 content in the gas phase was determined after its consumption by an NaOH solution as the change in the gas sample volume."
4,Study of pH effects on hydrogen production and starch utilization,"2.3 Study of pH effects on hydrogen production and starch utilization The pH dependence of total gas production during cultivation was studied in 500-ml flasks containing a pH electrode and a gas output recording system. The culture volume was 300ml. The pH values and the gas yields were recorded every 0.5–1.5h, and details of the experiments are given in the Results and discussion (Section 3.3)."
5,Other analytical methods,"2.4 Other analytical methods The concentrations of acetate, propionate, butyrate, and isobutyrate were determined by GC (TCVET800, Dzerzhinsk, Russia) as described earlier [2]. Alcohols were analyzed using a Pye-Unicam GCD (Cambridge, UK, Ltd) gas chromatograph, equipped with a 2m×2mm glass column packed with Chromosorb 101 (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland). The temperatures of the column, injector, and flame-ionization detector were 125, 150 and 180°C, respectively. The carrier gas was CO2 at a flow rate of 50ml/min. The culture samples were centrifuged at 12,000rpm for 15min. The supernatant was acidified with a 30% solution of orthophosphoric acid to below pH 3, and assayed without other pre-treatment. Lactate concentration was determined by an enzymatic method and monitored as NAD reduction at 340nm [11]. The total initial and residual starch contents in the medium during cultivation were assayed as glucose residues with anthrone reagent [12]. These values include both native starch and products of its degradation (hexose). The ammonium content was analyzed by the microdiffusion method [13]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,"Development of a starch-degrading, H2-producing microbial community","3.1 Development of a starch-degrading, H2-producing microbial community Different types of microbial communities were obtained from different sites, as described in the Materials and methods (Section 2.1). After preliminary screening for gas-production capacity, the most promising consortia were further characterized (Table 1 ). During incubation at 37°C, all samples produced gas. The gas output consisted of a mixture of H2 (34–61%) and CO2 (38–60%), with traces of N2. In some experiments methane formation was also observed, especially during the initial stages of consortium development. Gas production started after 1–3 days and stopped after 10 days of incubation in all samples. Table 1 shows that at 10gL−1 of added starch and 37°C, the highest volume of gas produced came from the silo pit liquid microbial community (2.6LL−1 of culture), whereas the lowest quantity was observed from the cardboard hydrolyzing consortium (0.4LL−1 of culture). Gas accumulation by the meadow grass rhizosphere consortium followed bi-phasic kinetics (data not shown), which is not desirable for continuous regime applications. At 55°C the cardboard hydrolyzing bacterial consortia produced 0.9LL−1 of culture at 10gL−1 starch. This was almost one third of the volume measured at 37°C for the silo pit liquid culture (Table 1). By increasing the starch content at 55°C to 30gL−1, we enhanced gas production by the cardboard hydrolyzing microbial consortium to 2.3LL−1 of culture. However, this volume was still not as high as that reported above for the silo pit liquid culture (10gL−1 starch, 37°C). This indicates that the efficiency of starch utilization under thermophilic conditions is lower than under mesophilic conditions in our experiments. Hence all experiments described in the following sections were performed with the microbial community obtained from the silo pit liquid at 37°C."
8,Optimization of the medium content,"3.2 Optimization of the medium content 3.2.1 Effect of metals It is known that fermentative H2 production by microbial consortia can be decreased significantly by the competitive methanogenic process. With the goal of developing a long-term continuous process for H2 production and considering that possible contamination by methanogenic bacteria might still occur after normal pre-treatments (see below), additional methods to suppress methanogenesis during prolonged operation of H2-producing fermentation reactors are essential. Thus in addition to submitting the cultures to pre-treatment by high temperature or low pH (for example, [8,9]), we note that the following inhibitors have been used by previous authors to further prevent methane production from occurring. These included bromosulfonates, anthraquinone dye, propionic acid, the antibiotic mevinoline, and heavy metals [14–16]. Metal ions are the simplest and cheapest potential inhibitors, and a number of methanogenic bacteria at pH 6.5 are very sensitive to both copper (1–5mgL−1) and zinc (1–10mgL−1) [14]. Since purple bacteria can tolerate zinc [2], we examined its effect on H2 production by the fermentative consortium. Gas production was indeed tolerant to zinc additions; 96±10% activity was observed in the presence of 10–50mgL−1 ZnCl2 at pH below 6.0 without visible optima or trends. The influence of Zn on the fermentation process has also been described by Yu and Fang [17], who demonstrated that zinc up to 80mgL−1 favored H2 and propionate production, but inhibited acetate production in dairy wastewaters. Zheng and Yu [18] concluded that the H2-production yield and butyrate production were enhanced by Zn at 5–500mgL−1, whereas acetate and propionate production was inhibited. Other authors have shown that the inhibition of H2 production (50%) by Zn is observed only at higher metal concentrations at ∼1600mgL−1 [8,9]. Consequently, zinc at low concentration might be used to prevent methane production without inhibiting H2 production, but perhaps with some shift in the metabolite profile. We in fact did use 10mgL−1 zinc in the experiments described in Section 3.3 and thereafter. To optimize H2 production we have studied the influence of iron addition to base medium, which already contained small amounts of this metal. Our results indicated that gas production, measured upon the addition of from 20 to 100mgL−1 FeSO4, increased to 149±33% of the control (data not shown). Similarly, Yang and Shen [19] demonstrated the stimulation of starch-dependent H2 production by ferrous iron at ∼150mgL−1, and values as high as 4000mgL−1 did not inhibit the process. Ding et al. [20], using a mixed culture for ethanol-type glucose fermentation, observed that the optimal Fe2+ concentration was 200mgL−1 (for H2-production yield) and 50mgL−1 (for specific H2-production rate). However Nath and Kumar [21] found only a marginal effect of Fe2+ (at ∼20mgL−1) on glucose-dependent, H2 production by Enterobacter cloacae. It seems that the iron requirement is dictated both by physiological properties of the cultures and by the iron availability in the base medium. We thus used 50mgL−1 FeSO4 in all experiments reported below. 3.2.2 Ammonium, peptone, and starch content Since dark, starch degradation is to be integrated with photosynthetic bacterial H2 photoproduction, the content of the nitrogenous compounds in the fermentative effluent should be minimal to avoid the repression of nitrogenase, the key H2-production enzyme in purple bacteria [22]. The simple omission of ammonium salt from the basic medium resulted in about a 2-fold stimulation of dark, fermentative gas production (Table 2 ), without visible negative effects on the culture growth characteristics (data not shown). We also studied the influence of another nitrogen source in our medium, namely peptone. The addition of peptone, a bacterial growth factor, to the base medium seemed to be essential for growth of the consortia in experiments with added starch. The data shown in Table 2 demonstrate that addition of peptone by itself resulted only in the production of a small amount of gas. An increase in the starch/peptone ratio, on the other hand, resulted in an increase in the gas output to ∼ 2.5LL−1 (at 9gL−1 starch and 1gL−1 peptone). In the absence of peptone in the medium, gas production decreased by about a half, evidently due to growth limitation of gas-producing bacteria even if the OD did not change significantly (data not shown). However, there were no significant differences in the gas yield at 1 and 10gL−1 peptone (at 9–10gL−1 starch), which agrees with the observation that peptone was not the substrate for gas production. However, the gas output was roughly proportional to the starch content, at least in the range of 0–30gL−1 (the whole set of data is not shown). As a result of the above experiments, ammonium was excluded from the medium, and a peptone concentration of 1gL−1 was used in subsequent experiments. Under these growth conditions, the ammonium content in the culture medium at the final stage of growth was below 0.5mM, which should be favorable for photoproduction of H2 by the purple bacteria in the second stage of waste treatment. 3.2.3 Effect of phosphate concentration Phosphate salts serve both as the source of phosphorus and as buffering compounds during starch fermentation. Considering that H2 production is a pH-dependent process and that the significant decrease in pH observed during starch degradation can result in shifting the mode of fermentation towards acetone–butanol production [23], optimal phosphate concentration in the medium is an important parameter. Judging from the total gas output (Fig. 1 , starch 30gL−1), maximal gas production was observed with 10–30gL−1 phosphate in the medium. Both the absence of phosphate as well as high phosphate concentrations (40–50gL−1) had a negative effect on the gas production. In the absence of phosphate, we observed lower ODs and more severe pH fluctuations during pH titration, which was done as described in Materials and methods (Section 2.2). At a starch concentration of 30gL−1, a phosphate content of ≥10gL−1 was sufficient to buffer the medium at the desirable pH value. At lower starch concentration, the optimal phosphate concentration would probably be proportionally lower. Based on all the data from the experiments described above, the optimized base medium (previously called base medium) content was set as follows and used in all subsequent experiments: 0.9gL−1 NaCl, 0.2gL−1 MgCl2, 0.2gL−1 CaCl2, 7.3gL−1 K2HPO4, 2.7gL−1 KH2PO4, 1.0gL−1 peptone, 10.0–30.0gL−1 starch, 50mgL−1 FeSO4, 10mgL−1 ZnCl2, 10.0mLL−1 microelements, 5.0mLL−1 vitamins, and an initial pH of 6.8–7.4 (kept above 5.0 by daily titration with KOH). 3.2.4 Influence of pH on starch-dependent gas production Using the above optimized base medium composition, we investigated the influence of pH on starch-dependent, gas production, using 30gL−1 starch and an initial pH of 6.8. The experiment protocol is exemplified in Fig. 2 . The actual pH values (Curve 1) and the total gas output (Curve 2) were recorded every 0.5–1.5h. At approximately 14h after inoculation, a spontaneous decrease in pH to 4.3 occurs due to starch-dependent acid formation. When the pH reached the critical value of 4.3, gas production was arrested, and a solution of 50% KOH was added drop wise to raise the pH to ∼6.5 again. This restored gas production. The procedure was repeated for 3 cycles of gas production over a total of 35h. The gas-production rate was calculated as the volume of H2 produced between points of measurements divided by the time between the two points (Curve 3). During the first cycle, the gas-production rate was determined by both increasing cell concentration (due to culture growth) and pH value, but by only the pH value during subsequent cycles. Thus, the first cycle was not suitable for the accurate study of the pH dependence. We next calculated the gas-production rates at every point of measurement during cycles 2 and 3 (after the first and second additions of KOH in Fig. 2) and plotted them against the average pH value between these points. The results in Fig. 3 demonstrate that the gas-production rate measured from either the second (Curve 1) or third (Curve 2) cycles of gas production exhibited similar pH dependences, with an optimum in the 5.2–5.6 range (the results were reproducible). The decrease in H2-production rate from cycle to cycle probably depended on the decrease in the starch content of the medium and on the accumulation of products of starch degradation. Our data clearly indicate the need for pH control in order to maximize H2 output. This was confirmed by comparing two batch experiments. In the first, carried out under uncontrolled pH conditions, we obtained total starch-dependent, gas production of about 1.1±0.5LL−1 of culture (at 30gL−1 starch). For the second, we adjusted the pH as described in Fig. 2. In this case gas production increased to 4.5±1.6LL−1 (average of 5 experiments including those in Table 3 ). The requirement for pH control to maximize H2 production in acidogenic process has also been discussed before (for references see [9]). Another effect of shifting pH is a shift in the profile of the predominant fermentation products found in the effluent. In general, pHs below 6.0 favor butyrate accumulation, while pHs above 6.5 favor acetate accumulation [9]. The optimal pH for mesophilic starch degradation has been reported to be at 5.2–5.5 [9,24–26], which is in agreement with our observations. Thermophilic processes that ferment products other than carbohydrates can display optimal pHs at 6.5–7.0 with acetate as a main fermentation product [27,28]. Thus, it may be possible to control the composition of the starch fermentation effluent that will be fed subsequently to a H2-producing photobioreactor."
9,"Kinetics of bacterial growth, H2 production, and accumulation of organic acids during starch fermentation","3.3 Kinetics of bacterial growth, H2 production, and accumulation of organic acids during starch fermentation The parameters and experimental protocol used to characterize culture growth and accumulation of fermentation products (H2 and VFAs) are seen in Fig. 4 . Growth of the culture (Fig. 4A) occurs mostly during the first day of the experiment, as judged by the changes in the OD of the cultures (Curve 1). Gas production, on the other hand, occurs mostly between days 2 and 5 (Curve 2), after growth stopped. The maximal rate of gas production in this experiment occurred between days 2 and 3, and it was equal to 2.2±0.8LL−1 of culture per day. From days 1–4, rapid spontaneous decreases in pH value followed by regular NaOH titrations are reported (Curve 3). This indicated active acidogenic processes in the culture. After 5 days (the second phase of experiment), the pH value stabilized (demonstrating the retardation of acidogenesis), and the percentage of H2 in the newly produced (but not accumulated) gas decreased (Curve 4). The metabolic shift between the first and second phases was further characterized by the kinetics of the individual VFAs produced. The composition of the VFAs in the effluents is shown in Fig. 4B. Most of the H2, butyrate, and lactate were produced during the first 4–5 days. Additional incubation resulted in the doubling of the acetate concentration and minor changes in the amounts of the other VFAs. The predominant VFAs at the end of the experiment were butyrate and acetate, with final concentrations of ∼9 and 6gL−1, respectively (approx 100mM each). Butyrate, however, accumulated at a faster rate. Lactate and ethanol were additional fermentation products found at final concentrations of 1.5–2.5gL−1. Minor amounts of propionate and isobutyrate (but no methanol or butanol) were also observed. The kinetics of lactate and ethanol accumulation probably reflects their reutilization during the later periods of the experiment (see below). Similarly, Kim et al. [29] reported that lactate was produced as the earliest metabolic intermediate, but as the reaction continued, short chain VFAs were produced as final end products, accompanied by a decrease in lactic acid content. By comparing Fig. 4A and B, it is clear that gas production correlates closely with butyrate production, whereas acetate formation followed a different pattern of accumulation. A correlation between H2 and butyrate production was found previously for glucose-degrading anaerobic cultures [18]. In other examples, a correlation between H2 and propionate/acetate production was observed [9]. Changes in the biochemical pathways from H2 and butyrate production to acetate production (Fig. 4) may reflect the successive activities of various bacterial groups of the consortium during different phases of the fermentation process. The possibility of product content redistribution must be considered when a dark, fermentative reactor is connected up in series with a photobioreactor. Maximum gas output in the fermentative reactor occurs after approximately 120h of operation. Subsequently, the gas-production rate decreases as does the relative H2 concentration in the gas phase (Fig. 4A, Curve 4). Extended operation of the dark reactor is productive only if the fermentation products accumulated during the later times are preferable (i.e., usable) for optimal H2 production by the photosynthetic bacteria in the photobioreactor. The profile of the final fermentative products found in the dark reactor (Fig. 4) is given in Table 3. Three flasks cultivated in parallel gave reproducible H2 and CO2 yields as well as acetate and butyrate production results. On the other hand, large variability in the content of the additional products, especially lactate and ethanol, was observed between different flasks. This may indicate an inhomogeneous composition of the microbial consortium. Nevertheless, carbon recovery was close to 100% in each of the three experiments. The volumetric yield of H2 production was rather high, due, evidently to the high substrate (starch) concentration. However, the efficiency of starch utilization for H2 production was ∼40% when compared to the theoretical stoichiometry of 4molmol−1 glucose. Nevertheless, the 1.6molmol−1 value (Table 3) is close to the reported values for mesophilic processes which normally vary between 0.97 and 2.25 [9,24,30]."
10,The influence of VFAs on starch-dependent hydrogen production,"3.4 The influence of VFAs on starch-dependent hydrogen production As shown above, high concentrations of organic acids accumulate as products of starch fermentation. Moreover, organic acids are found in agricultural/industrial wastes. All can be used in an integrated process incorporating dark, fermentation reactors. The influence of these VFAs on H2 production has not yet been studied, but it is known that methane production can be inhibited by high concentrations of organic acids [31]. Therefore we studied the effects of added organic acids and alcohols on dark, fermentation processes. The changes in total gas output using various concentrations of added compounds compared to that in their absence are seen in Fig. 5 . The experiments were carried out at an initial concentration of 30gL−1 starch and were continued until gas production (9±2 days) stopped. The complete inhibition of gas production was observed upon the addition of ≥10gL−1 of either isobutyrate or butanol. These concentrations also caused a decrease in culture growth rate, and in the case of butanol, an increase in the lag phase. Butyrate (15gL−1) or propionate (20gL−1) caused a 50% inhibition of gas production, and a minor negative effect on gas production was found with 5–15gL−1 acetate. Since this effect was not pronounced at higher acetate concentrations, we suggest that acetate addition causes a shift in metabolic pathway organization towards solvent production as was shown earlier for glucose fermentation by Clostridia [32,33]. Ethanol did not affect gas production up to 20gL−1. Unlike the above mentioned compounds, the addition of lactate at 10–15gL−1 resulted in an almost 80% increase of gas production (but no growth stimulation). This suggests that lactate can be used as a direct substrate for H2 production by some component of this consortium as has been reported for some Clostridia [34]. Our study has shown that starch-dependent, gas production by the selected microbial consortium tolerated low concentrations (<5gL−1) of five out of eight added organic acids and alcohols. At higher concentrations, the sensitivity of the consortium varied, depending on the added compound. Taking into consideration the final content of VFAs measured in the fermentor (Fig. 4, Table 3), it is possible that the decreased gas-production rate after 4 days (Fig. 4A) can be accounted for, at least partially, by butyrate and acetate inhibition."
11,Summary,"In conclusion, our results indicate that microbial consortium obtained from silo pit liquid might be used in a process for dark, H2 production from starch at 37°C. The exclusion of ammonium and the addition of Fe ions along with peptone appear to enhance fermentative H2 production, and the fermentative effluent might be useful for subsequent H2 photoproduction by purple bacteria. Zinc can be added to the dark, fermentation medium to inhibit the growth of methanogenic organisms. To provide optimal pH, a higher phosphate concentration (buffering capacity) and additional pH titrations have proven to be important. Furthermore, the stoichiometric ratio of H2 production to starch utilization was ∼1.6mol of H2 mol−1 glucose, which is close to other published data on dark, mesophilic, fermentation processes. Besides H2, the main products of fermentation were butyrate and acetate, but with different kinetics of accumulation. Various VFAs and alcohols (over a wide range of concentrations) were examined as potential effectors of H2 production. We found a stimulative effect of added lactate and a strong inhibitory effect of added isobutyrate and butanol on gas production. However, taking into account the actual concentrations of the products of starch fermentation present in the fermentative broth, one concludes that only butyrate and acetate accumulation might actually inhibit H2 production under real life conditions."
