0,Introduction,"Selective hydrogenation of α, β-unsaturated aldehyde (e.g., cinnamaldehyde (CAL)) by molecular hydrogen is one of the most atomically efficient and environmental friendly routes for the synthesis of α, β-unsaturated alcohols (e.g., cinnamyl alcohol (COL)), which are important intermediates for fragrances and pharmaceuticals production [1–3]. However, due to the thermodynamically favorable hydrogenation of C = C double bond, hydrogenation of α, β-unsaturated aldehyde inevitably forms by-products, such as aldehyde and saturated alcohol. Various catalysts have been developed to improve the selectivity towards COL. For instance, some studies focused on the Au supported on the oxides for CAL chemoselective hydrogenation [4–8], and Pd-based catalysts can also be used in the hydrogenation of CAL and have good catalytic performance [9–13]. Among these catalysts, Pt-based catalysts are the most widely used in this hydrogenation reaction, and are thus a promising choice for their excellent activity [14]. Due to the rare reserves of Pt, Pt-based active phase is typically supported on a variety of supports to increase atomic utilization, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) owning to tunable nanotube cavity structure, large length to diameter ratio and boundary effects. The selective modification of the CNT surface can not only achieve the anchoring of the active component phase, but also prevent the loss and the sintering of the active phase during reaction [15–18]. Based on the surface modifications, nitrogen functions on CNT surface may introduce some complex factors, such as nitrogen species and metals may have an electron transfer interaction [18]. Alternatively, using oxygen functionalized CNTs (oCNTs) as support can improve the dispersion and utilization of the active components. The introduction of a second metal is also an effective way to enhance the catalytic properties of Pt nanoparticles (NPs). It has been reported that metal promoters, e.g. Zn, Sn, Fe, Ni and Ru, play a vital role in improving the selectivity towards unsaturated alcohols due to the synergetic interactions between Pt and promoters [19–27]. The introduction of the promoters not only improved the dispersion but also modified the electronic structure of the metallic active sites [28–30]. For example, the introduction of Sn into Pt NPs and further oxidized to form Pt-SnOx, where SnOx is an electrophilic site for adsorption and activation of C = O bonds. The selectivity to unsaturated alcohol was enhanced from 4.3% to 61.5% by the synergetic effect between SnOx and Pt active sites [23]. Pt-Co alloy supported on SBA-15 and the effect of Pt/Co ratio on selective hydrogenation of CAL were investigated, illustrating the formation of Pt-Co alloy improved more Pt0 species in Pt-Co/SBA-15 catalyst, which was beneficial to the enhancement on selective hydrogenation of CAL to COL [31]. However, there is lack of observations on the structural changes of catalyst before and after reaction in these works. It can reveal the structural evolution and the cause of deactivation of the catalyst under the reaction conditions. Therefore, the structural evolution of the catalysts during liquid reaction still need to be further explored in detail. Compared with the traditional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methods, the identical location TEM (IL-TEM) method can be more straightforward approach to explore the structural characteristics of the catalysts at the same location at various stages of the reaction. By comparing and statistically analyzing the catalyst structure information of the same location at each stage of the reaction, this method makes it possible to provide valuable insight into the structural evolution, the cause of the deactivation and the reaction mechanism of the catalyst during reaction process. These information can be further combined with the performance test results to accurately explain its structure–activity relationship [18,32–35]. In this work, a series of PtxCoy bimetallic catalyst with varied Pt to Co ratios supported on oCNTs were synthesized. The chemoselective hydrogenation of CAL was chosen as probe reaction to explore the effect of second metal Co on Pt NPs. The structural evolution during the catalytic reaction was also investigated by IL-TEM method in detail, and the corresponding structure function relationship was proposed."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of PtxCoy nanoparticles,"2.1 Synthesis of PtxCoy nanoparticles PtxCoy NPs were synthesized by a facile modified oleyamine (OAm) reduction method [36]. In a typical process, PtCo3 NPs were synthesized as follows: platinum(II) acetylacetonate [Pt(acac)2] (6.4 mg) and cobalt(II) acetylacetonate [Co(acac)2] (19.7 mg) were dissolved in OAm (10 mL) in a 100 mL three necked round-bottom flask. The solution was kept stirring at 60 °C and maintained for 20 min, then 20 mg borane tertbutylamine complex (BTB) was added into flask at 100 °C and maintained for 20 min, and heated to 230 °C and kept for 30 min. The process was carried out under the protection of N2 atmosphere protection. After cooling to room temperature, the solution was washed three times with n-hexane/ethanol, then dispersed in 30 mL n-hexane. Other PtxCoy NPs were synthesized in the same procedure, although the reduction temperature was 200 °C rather than 230 °C."
3,Preparation of PtxCoy-oCNTs catalyst,"2.2 Preparation of PtxCoy-oCNTs catalyst CNTs supplied by Tsinghua University were treated with water-diluted HCl (volume ratio is 1:1) before being used. The average outer diameter range of most CNTs is between 15 and 20 nm. The oxygen-containing CNTs were obtained by treating the pristine CNTs with the mixture of concentrated HNO3 and H2SO4 (with the volume ratio of 1:1) at 50 °C for 2 h, labeled as oCNTs. 400 mg of oCNTs was dispersed in 80 mL ethanol and was ultrasonically treated to obtain a homogeneous suspension. Subsequently, 30 mL n-hexane with NPs was added dropwise to the oCNTs dispersion while vigorous stirring. The mixture was ultrasound for 1 h and stirring for 4 h. Finally, the resultant solid was collected by centrifugation with ethanol and dried, followed by a reduction process with H2 at 200 °C for 1 h. The catalysts were labeled as Pt-oCNTs, Pt3Co-oCNTs, PtCo-oCNTs and PtCo3-oCNTs, respectively."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization An FEI Tecnai G2 F20 transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped with high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) detector operated at 200 kV, an FEI Talos F200X, and an FEI Titan 80–300 HB Cubed (High Based platform) with double spherical aberration correction operating at 200 kV were used for acquiring TEM, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), and HAADF-STEM images. The TEM images obtained through IL-TEM method were acquired at 120 kV in order to avoid the electron-beam irradiation damage. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using an X-ray diffractometer (D/MAX-2400) with Cu Kα source (λ = 1.5406 Å) at a scan rate of 2 deg min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were carried out by ESCALAB 250 instrument with Al Kα X-rays as radiation source (1486.6 eV, 150 W, and 50.0 eV pass energy). The charging effects were eliminated by calibrating the observed spectra with the C 1 s binding energy (BE) value of 284.8 eV. The actual loading amount of Pt and Co was determined by a Leeman Laboratories Prodigy inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)."
5,Catalytic reaction,"2.4 Catalytic reaction In a typical test, the liquid-phase hydrogenation of CAL was carried out in a well-stirred autoclave (50 mL) at 80 °C. The prepared PtxCoy-oCNTs catalysts (30 mg) and 5 mmol CAL were dispersed in 10 mL 1,4-dioxane by ultrasound, and then transferred into the autoclave, which was flushed with H2 for several times in order to remove any trace of oxygen. The temperature was then raised to 80 °C and the vessel was pressurized by 1.5 MPa H2. High stirring speed (600 r/min) was used in order to reduce the mass transfer limitations from the gas to the liquid phase, to increase the rate of reactant transfer from the bulk liquid to the catalyst surface, and to minimize the external diffusion resistance. After the reaction, 500 uL anisole as external standard was added into the reaction mixture, then the reactants were analyzed using gas chromatography (Agilent 7890 A)."
6,Stability of the catalysts investigated by IL-TEM method,"2.5 Stability of the catalysts investigated by IL-TEM method Prior to the reaction, a very low amount of catalysts was deposited on the top side of a copper grid with built-in alphabetical code. The grid was thereafter inserted in TEM to capture the initial state of the catalyst and track the accurate locations of the catalyst using the alphabetical code. The TEM grid acts as a shuttle, which allows the transfer of PtxCoy-oCNTs catalysts between the electron microscope and the liquid reaction environment. Then the TEM grid was transferred to a specimen stage and participated the selective hydrogenation of CAL reaction at the same condition with standard reaction. Grid without catalyst tested as reference showed no activity toward CAL hydrogenation reaction. After the reaction, the TEM grid was dried thoroughly and then transferred to the electron microscope again to acquire the TEM images at identical locations."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of the catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of the catalysts The actual Pt and Co contents of Pt-oCNTs, Pt3Co-oCNTs, PtCo-oCNTs and PtCo3-oCNTs are listed in Table S1. The Pt contents were examined as 1.605, 1.878, 1.591 and 0.755 wt%, and the Co contents were 0, 0.226, 0.364 and 0.664 wt%, respectively. These measurements indicate that Pt/Co atomic ratios are approximately close to desired ratios. Fig. 1 (a-d) show the HAADF-STEM images of PtxCoy-oCNTs catalysts and particle size distribution (PSD) histograms of the corresponding NPs. The images show that PtxCoy NPs are uniformly dispersed on oCNTs supports. The mean particle sizes are 4.4, 3.6, 3.5 and 5.0 nm regarding Pt-oCNTs, Pt3Co-oCNTs, PtCo-oCNTs and PtCo3-oCNTs, respectively. Fig. 1(e-h) and the insets show the HRTEM images and the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns of the catalysts. The isolated spots in FFTs demonstrate the crystalline structures of the PtxCoy NPs. The lattice fringes of (2 0 0) and (1 1 1) with a characteristic acute angle of 54.7° were identified on the various PtxCoy NPs, indicating the face-centered cubic (FCC) structure. The d-spacing of (1 1 1) and (2 0 0) decreased with the increasing of Co content, which further indicates the formation of PtxCoy NPs. The crystalline structures of the catalysts are also analyzed by high-resolution STEM (HRSTEM) and XRD (Fig. 2 ). The HRSTEM images show that with the introduction of Co, the crystal structure and diffraction peaks of Pt NPs gradually change. The diffraction peaks at 25.8°, 42.2°, 54.5° and 77.2° observed in the XRD patterns can be attributed to the (0 0 2), (1 0 0), (0 0 4), and (1 1 0) crystal planes of graphite structure, respectively. The diffraction peaks at ca. 39.7°, 46.2° and 67.4° are ascribed to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0) and (2 2 0) crystal planes of Pt NPs with FCC structure. A broad diffraction peak observed at 39.7° indicates that Pt NPs are all with small size. In addition, an obvious shift of diffraction peak from Pt to Co with the increase of Co content is observed, which indicates the formation of PtxCoy NPs. These results are in agreement with the structural feature reflected by the HRTEM and HRSTEM analysis. The surface chemical states of Pt were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). Fig. 2c shows Pt 4f spectra of Pt-oCNTs, Pt3Co-oCNTs, PtCo-oCNTs and PtCo3-oCNTs catalysts together with their deconvolution obtained by fitting Gaussian peaks after Shirley-background subtraction. Here, Pt 4f spectra were deconvoluted into two components, including the predominant metallic Pt (Pt0) and oxide states Pt (Pt2+). The existence of Pt2+ may be caused by the fact that Pt was not completely reduced during the preparation process, or by oxidation in the air, or by contact with the oxygen functional group of the support. The analysis results indicate that the introduction of Co species has a direct influence on Pt 4f binding energy. An appreciable shift to higher values of Pt 4f7/2 binding energy is observed in PtxCoy-oCNTs bimetallic catalysts compared to that of monometallic Pt-oCNTs, revealing that there may exist electron transfer from Pt to Co in these bimetallic catalysts. Thus, the as-prepared bimetallic catalysts contain positively charged Pt, and the extent of electron-deficiency increase with an increased Co content. These results unravel the strong interaction between the Pt and the added Co."
9,Catalytic selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde,"3.2 Catalytic selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde The catalytic performance was evaluated in the selective hydrogenation of CAL over Pt-oCNTs, Pt3Co-oCNTs, PtCo-oCNTs and PtCo3-oCNTs catalysts, as shown in Fig. 3 a. PtCo3-oCNTs catalyst exhibits the best catalytic performance with 76% selectivity to COL at a 99% CAL conversion after 1 h of reaction. In order to compare the catalytic performance of the various catalysts well, the reaction time was reduced to 0.5 h. We found that Pt-oCNTs displayed the highest HCAL selectivity and the lowest COL selectivity, demonstrating that the C = C hydrogenation is preferential on Pt-oCNTs. With the introduction of Co, the COL selectivity increased obviously, and resulting the more of Co the higher of the COL selectivity, which indicates that Co prevents the hydrogenation of C = C and promotes the hydrogenation of C = O. Comparing with other catalysts, PtCo3-oCNTs catalyst has the highest reaction rate. Co could markedly enhance the activity of Pt for CAL conversion and the selectivity to COL, which contribute to the fact that the introduction of Co changes the electronic state of Pt, making it more advantageous for the adsorption of C = O double bonds. Competitive adsorption experiments of two intermediates were further conducted over Pt-oCNTs and PtCo3-oCNTs, as shown in Table 1 . The results show that when the substrate is COL or HCAL, both catalysts exhibit a higher reaction rate to COL than to HCAL. However, when two intermediate products HCAL and COL were used as reactants to participate in the reaction, it can be intuitively seen that the addition of Co significantly changed the substrate's adsorption selectivity for Pt-based catalysts. When both intermediates are present, the hydrogenation rate of HCAL catalyzed by PtCo3-oCNTs catalyst is faster compared to that catalyzed by Pt-oCNTs catalyst. It shows that when the C = C and C = O double bonds coexist, the PtCo3-oCNTs catalyst preferentially adsorbs the C = O double bond; while Pt catalyst preferentially adsorbs the C = C double bond, resulting in a difference in reaction rate, that is, a difference in selectivity. The product distribution over Pt-oCNTs and PtCo3-oCNTs catalysts were also studied in CAL hydrogenation with the extension of reaction time. The conversion of CAL increases with reaction time over both catalysts is shown in Fig. 4 . The main catalytic product over Pt-oCNTs catalyst is HCAL, which will be over hydrogenated to HCOL with increasing reaction time. In contrast, the main catalytic product over PtCo3-oCNTs catalyst is COL and the amount of the other semi-hydrogenated product HCAL is very few. As the reaction time is prolonged, the excessive hydrogenation product HCOL will increase slightly and ultimately reach a steady-state over time. This result further indicates that the introduction of Co can prevent the C = C hydrogenation and promote the C = O hydrogenation effectively. The stability of PtCo3-oCNTs catalyst in the selective hydrogenation of CAL was further investigated based on its excellent activity. The catalyst was recovered by the centrifugation after every catalytic run and then used for the next run under the same reaction conditions. As shown in Fig. 3b, after the fourth runs, the conversion of CAL decreased from about 88% to 69%, while the selectivity to COL exhibits a small increase from 79% to 88%. The XPS data in Fig. S2 and Table S2 show that the used catalysts remain stable compared to fresh catalysts. The structural characterizations of the fresh, used and cycled PtCo3-oCNTs are shown in Fig. 5 . The analysis on HRTEM images of fresh, used and cycled PtCo3-oCNTs catalysts reveals the lattice structure is stable after reaction. The XRD pattern of the cycled and used PtCo3-oCNTs catalysts are almost same with that of the fresh one, indicating the cycled and used catalysts maintain the crystal structure of PtCo3. Furthermore, the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental maps show that the distribution of Pt and Co elements in the fresh, used. and cycled PtCo3 NPs are also almost same. Based on the above analysis, the microstructure of PtCo3 NPs is stable during the reaction, thus the selectivity to COL doesn’t change significantly. As the number of cycles increases, the slightly lower conversion rate may be due to the detachment or agglomeration of the NPs during the cycle, which are further studied by IL-TEM. Fig. S3 shows the schematic diagram of IL-TEM liquid phase reactor, and the accurate investigation of the structural evolutions are shown in Figs. 6 and S4. The PSD histograms of the catalyst displayed in Fig. 6e, j, o show that the average particle size of PtCo3 NPs remains constant after being used and cycled. However, the number of particles of smaller size reduced, and a small amount of large size particles appeared after the cycle, indicating that the smaller particles may agglomerate into larger particles. The TEM images at the identical location obtained under different state clearly show that some particles (marked by red circles) agglomerate during the reaction. In addition, there are also some particles detaching from the support (marked by green circles), and there also are a lot of particles that are stable on the support (marked by yellow circles). In this reaction, the active component of the catalyst is PtxCoy NPs. During the recycling process, the detachment of the NPs will cause the loss of the active components, resulting in a decrease in cycling performance, which is consistent with the ICP results (Table S1). Therefore, in order to increase the stability of the catalyst, the metal-support interaction should be enhanced to prevent the migration of the particles on the supports."
10,Conclusion,"In summary, a series of optimized PtxCoy bimetallic catalyst with varied Pt to Co ratios and uniform particle size distribution were synthesized by a facile modified oleyamine reduction method. After being supported on oCNTs, their catalytic performances were tested in the chemoselective hydrogenation of CAL. With the decrease of Pt to Co ratio, the COL selectivity increased obviously. Among these, PtCo3-oCNTs performs the best catalytic performance with 76% COL selectivity at 99% CAL conversion. This can be contributed to the introduction of Co, which changes the electronic state of Pt, and markedly enhances the selectivity to COL. Further characterization of the fresh, used and cycled catalysts revealed that the PtCo3 NP structure was stable. Moreover, the structural evolution of PtCo3-oCNTs during the cycle experiment was studied by IL-TEM in detail. The deactivation of the catalyst result from the agglomeration and detachment of PtCo3 NPs. It clearly shows the straightforward evidence for the deactivation of catalyst, and provides the guidance for synthesizing stable supported catalysts."
