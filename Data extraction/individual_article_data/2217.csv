0,Introduction,"The air injection process (AIP) is widely applied for enhanced oil recovery purposes. During the AIP, compressed air is injected into the oil reservoir to react with a portion of the in-situ crude oil, generating flue gas and heat to displace the reset in-situ crude oil to the production well. According to previous differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies, crude oil oxidation is characterized by two distinguish exothermic periods, namely, low-temperature oxidation (LTO) and high-temperature oxidation (HTO) [1]. The decreasing period of the crude oil self-heating rate between LTO and HTO is called the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) region (Fig. 1 ). For many years, petroleum engineers have used various methods to study crude oil oxidation; however, the oxidation mechanisms for forecasting the air injection performance are still unclear [2]. Crude oil is a mixture of various hydrocarbons [3]. In the past, petroleum engineers studied crude oil as-is most of the time. Based on the most significant differences (i.e., density and viscosity) between different crude oil samples, petroleum engineers used various oil samples to conduct thermal experiments and utilized the observed experimental results for engineering uses [1,4,5]. However, an analysis that only considers the crude oil density and viscosity may cause a problem for understanding crude oil oxidation process during the AIP [3]. Yannimaras and Tiffin [6] tested four different crude oil samples using an accelerated-rate calorimeter (ARC). In their tests, the four crude oil samples exhibited different oxidation characteristics, albeit having similar densities. Hydrocarbon oxidation is known as a series of chain reactions. As suggested by Freitag [7], during the hydrocarbon oxidation, peroxides, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids might be generated through the oxidation chain reactions of alkanes. Based on previous studies [8–10], when contacting with oxygen, alkanes first generate peroxides, then alcohols, followed by aldehydes, and finally completely burn to generate carbon dioxide and water. Other functional groups of hydrocarbons, such as the benzene ring, can affect the oxidation characteristics [11]. Therefore, the functional groups of hydrocarbons have a huge impact on the oxidation characteristics of crude oil. To understand crude oil oxidation process, it is better to analyze crude oil from the aspect of hydrocarbon functional groups rather than only analyze it as an integration of various hydrocarbons. Researchers have already investigated this problem and performed various attempts to study the impact of different kinds of hydrocarbons on crude oil oxidation. Belgrave et al. [12] characterized crude oil by the solubility in n-pentane or n-heptane. The portion of crude oil that can be solved in n-pentane or n-heptane is called maltenes. The other portion is called asphaltenes. Coke is further separated from asphaltenes according to the solubility in toluene. The solubility depends on the polarities of hydrocarbons and the solvent. Therefore, this method, which characterizes crude oil with maltenes, asphaltenes, and coke, can separate the components in crude oil according to different kinds of hydrocarbons. Later on, to further investigate the impact of hydrocarbon types on crude oil oxidation, maltenes were further characterized with saturates, aromatics, and resins. Together with the asphaltene, n-pentane, or n-heptane insoluble fraction, this method is called the saturates, aromatics, resins, and asphaltene (SARA) analysis. The SARA analysis is also based on the solubility of different kinds of hydrocarbons in various kinds of organic solvents; thus, the SARA components are separated according to their polarities. The polarities of the SARA components are arranged from low to high as saturates, aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes. Zhao et al. [13] combined SARA analysis with various other methods to analyze the oxidation behaviors of crude oil. It proved that SARA could be robust tool for understanding the oxidation behavior of crude oil. However, the SARA analysis is still a bulk analysis method: each SARA sample might still contain hydrocarbons with various functional groups. To further dig into the details of the AIP, a fundamental study is essential for understanding the exothermic behavior of crude oil. Previous studies [8,9,14,15] on methane have presented some important hydrocarbons during the combustion process. Most of the possible hydrocarbons in crude oil, such as alkanes, alcohols, and aldehydes, are linked by a series of chain reactions. The concentrations of these hydrocarbons affect how the chain reactions go. This study presents a method of using an ARC to study the self-heating behavior of three kinds of C10 hydrocarbons, namely, n-decane, 1-decanol, and 1-decanal, to investigate the roles of these three types of hydrocarbons in AIP application. Mixture tests are conducted to study the concentration changes of these three types in actual crude oil."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Instrument,"2.1 Instrument During the AIP, the self-heating behavior of crude oil will occur under a suitable ambient temperature once oxygen comes into contact with the in-situ crude oil [16]. On the oxidation onset, the in-situ crude oil heats itself to produce flue gas and heat to displace the other portion of crude oil to the producer. Therefore, a proper instrument should be selected to study the self-heating behavior of crude oil. Petroleum engineers previously mostly applied thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) and DSC to study crude oil oxidation. The TGA/DSC has two drawbacks. First, they both use a constant heating rate of usually 10–30 °C/min to heat the sample [4,17], which might cause a wrong measurement in the exotherm range for the self-heating behavior when the actual self-heating rate of the sample is lower than the instrument’s heating rate. One study [18] shows that, when heating rate is higher, the LTO and HTO peaks measured by the DSC will shift to the higher temperature. When heating rate is higher, the fuel volume left for higher temperature would be more, which might cause deviations in the sample exotherm measurement. Second, a constant airflow is applied to purge the gas-phase components, which might affect the hydrocarbon accumulation in the voids for the vapor phase oxidation. The ARC is an instrument that allows the sample to heat itself in an adiabatic condition. Once the sample starts the exotherm, the heaters around the sample vessel will heat the ambient temperature at the same pace of the sample to minimize the heat loss. The ARC can keep a minimum heating rate of approximately 0.002 °C/min to maintain the adiabatic condition, which is way lower and better than TGA/DSC. Thus, the ARC was selected for this study. The ARC used was from Thermal Hazard Technology, UK. The sample vessel was a Hastelloy spherical bomb with 2.5 cm outside diameter. The closed-ARC method was selected to include both gas and liquid phase reactions to study the fast reaction phenomenon in the LTO temperature range. During the closed-ARC test, compressed air will be pre-injected into the sample vessel, and the inlet valve will be closed to form a closed environment for the test. The standard “heat–wait–seek” method of the ARC was applied during the tests. During the “heat” phase, the ARC heats the sample to the predefined temperature stage. During the “wait” phase, the ARC waits for a predefined period until the sample temperature becomes stable. During the “search” stage, the ARC tries to keep the ambient temperature. At the onset of the reaction, the ARC will heat the ambient temperature at the same pace as that of the sample during the “seek” period. The reaction search temperature for the ARC was set to 50 °C–400 °C, with 10 °C or 15 °C between each two search stages. All ARC tests were conducted with 100 bar pre-injected compressed air. For each test, approximately 2.3 g hydrocarbon sample was placed in the sample vessel. The safety temperature increase rate of the ARC was 1000 °C/min. The ARC will halt the measurement if the self-heating rate of the sample is higher than the safety temperature increase rate."
3,Samples,"2.2 Samples According to the previous oxidation studies [8,9,14,15,19,20] on methane, Fig. 2 which shows one possible pathway of alkyl hydrocarbons n-Decane, 1-decanol, and 1-decanal were selected to investigate the effect of hydrocarbons with various functional groups on crude oil oxidation during the AIP for the following reasons: a. They all have a straight carbon chain with ten carbon atoms. b. All functional groups are on the alpha carbon. c. They are all in the alkyl hydrocarbon oxidation chain suggested by previous studies. d. They are all easy to acquire and store. All three chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Decyl peroxide was not tested owing to the lack of availability. A crude oil sample was used herein to check the mixing effects of the chemicals with the actual crude oil sample. This crude oil sample had 47° API density and 2cP (20 °C) viscosity. All the mixture samples were pre-mixed to form uniform mixtures for the tests."
4,Results,
5,Pure hydrocarbon tests,"3.1 Pure hydrocarbon tests Each pure hydrocarbon sample was tested in the ARC with the stated test program to examine the self-heating behavior of the selected C10 hydrocarbons. Figs. 3–5 depict the self-heating rate curves of n-decane, 1-decanol, and 1-decanal, respectively. As shown in Figs. 3–6 , all three pure hydrocarbons showed a very fast temperature increase before the sample temperatures reached 220 °C. The exotherm onset temperatures of n-decane and 1-decanol were approximately 160 °C, whereas that of 1-decanal was approximately 60 °C. Only n-decane and 1-decanol showed two exotherm peaks on the self-heating rate curves. 1-Decanal only showed one self-heating rate peak."
6,Mixing tests of 1-decanol with crude oil,"3.2 Mixing tests of 1-decanol with crude oil The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) test was conducted to determine the kinds of hydrocarbons in the crude oil sample. The NMR test for protons can be used to identify different kinds of protons in the hydrocarbon molecule according to the chemical shifts of different NMR peaks, and the NMR has been used elsewhere to identify the contents of crude oil [21]. Fig. 7 depicts the NMR result of the crude oil sample. Fig. 7 depicts that most of the protons were alkyl and active protons. We found almost no aldehyde protons, which should have the peaks between the chemical shifts of 9 and 10 ppm, in the tested crude oil sample. The proton peaks on carboxylic acid were also not found because no peaks had a chemical shift higher than 10 ppm. Therefore, most of the hydrocarbons in the crude oil are considered alkanes [22]. Under this consideration, only the mixing tests of 1-decanol and 1-decanal with crude oil were conducted. Fig. 8 illustrates the temperature profiles of the mixing tests of 1-decanol with crude oil. The weight percentages of 1-decanol in the mixture were 0%, 25%, 50%, and 100%. The 100% 1-decanol test was halted because of an excessively high self-heating rate. The flat temperature line of the 100% decanol test indicates the last recorded temperature before halting the test. Fig. 8 illustrates that the onset temperature of the mixture did not change much when mixing the crude oil with 1-decanol. However, in a 1-decanol weight percentage below 50%, between the temperature range of 155 °C and 178 °C, the exotherm of the mixture decreased with the increasing 1-decanol. Figs. 9–11 show the self-heating rates of the 1-decanol–crude oil mixtures with the decanal weight percentages of 0%, 25%, and 50%, respectively. In Fig. 9, the crude oil only showed one self-heating rate peak during the tested temperature range, with the peak rate way below 1 °C/min. However, in Figs. 10 and 11, Fig. 12. with more 1-decanol and less crude oil in the sample, the exotherm of the sample started to show a two-peak exothermic behavior."
7,Mixing tests of 1-decanal with crude oil,"3.3 Mixing tests of 1-decanal with crude oil Fig. 13 depicts the mixing test of 1-decanal with crude oil. The weight percentages of 1-decanal were 0%, 25%, 50%, and 100%. The 50% 1-decanal and 100% 1-decanal tests were halted because of the excessively high self-heating rate. The flat lines of the 50% and 100% decanal cases indicate the last recorded temperatures before halting the tests. Fig. 11 depicts that with the increasing 1-decanal fraction in the mixture, the overall reaction rate was faster, and the exotherm onset temperature of the mixture was lower. Fig. 9 shows the self-heating rate curve of 0% 1-decanal (i.e., crude-oil-only case). Figs. 14 and 15 illustrate the self-heating rate curves of the 1-decanal–crude oil mixture with the 1-decanal weight percentages of 25% and 50%, respectively. Fig. 16 shows that the early exotherm started to show a fast temperature increasing period when 1-decanal was added to the crude oil sample. Therefore, three distinctive reaction periods can be identified from the self-heating rate curves of the 1-decanal–crude oil mixture."
8,Discussions,
9,Pure hydrocarbon tests,"4.1 Pure hydrocarbon tests As suggested in Fig. 2, the three measured pure C10 hydrocarbons are located at the same oxidation chain, that is, 1-decanol should be one of the products from the n-decane LTO reactions, and 1-decanal should one of the products of the NTC reactions. Therefore, the main enthalpy of the LTO should mainly come from the reactions of n-decane because 1-decanol is one of the end products of the n-decane LTO chain reactions. A comparison of Figs. 3 and 4 inferred two exotherm peaks on the self-heating rate curves. The LTO exotherm peak of n-decane maxed at approximately 200 °C/min at 190 °C, whereas the LTO exotherm peak of 1-decanol maxed at approximately 10 °C/min at 170 °C. This result is in agreement with those of the previous methane oxidation studies; thus, the main enthalpy of the LTO should come from the reactions of alkanes. According to Fig. 2, alcohols would be the products of LTO. However, decanol still showed some LTO reactions on the self-heating rate curves. This enthalpy could come from the oxidation alkyl part of decanol that some alkyl radicals generated and reacted during the oxidation. Even decane and decanol has a similar 9-carbon aliphatic chain, the LTO of decanol was much weaker than the LTO of decane. Comparing the ARC results with those of the previous methane oxidation studies [8,9,14,15], we conclude that with the increase of the carbon chain length from one carbon atom to ten carbon atoms, the oxidation behavior of hydrocarbons still highly depends on the functional groups. Meanwhile, the HTO exotherm peak on the self-heating rate curve of n-decane was similar to that of 1-decanol. They both exhibited a maximum self-heating rate at approximately 200 °C/min. Therefore, according to this study and the previous methane oxidation experiments, the main difference between alkanes and alcohols is the first exothermic period because the main enthalpy is generated through the process from alkanes LTO reactions. The self-heating rate curve in Fig. 5 of 1-decanal is different from those in Fig. 3 of n-decane and 4 of 1-decanol, that is, only one exotherm period was recorded, and an excessively high self-heating rate was observed at this only exotherm peak. Fig. 2 shows that aldehyde was located at the end of the NTC reaction. Generally speaking, the self-heating rate of hydrocarbons decreases during the NTC period [1,7], which was not favorable for the AIP. If the previous methane oxidation study is applicable to the 1-decanal oxidation, this only exotherm peak of 1-decanal should be the “second peak”, namely the “HTO peak”, as in the cases of n-decane and 1-decanol. Since there was no NTC detected in the decanal test, aldehydes could be the products of NTC reactions; hence, when undergoing the self-heating process, aldehydes will not undergo the NTC period again. The aldehyde oxidation should directly come into the HTO reaction pattern. If assuming the decanal peak was the LTO peak and the previous methane studies [10,14,15,20] are correct, the peak would be caused by the aliphatic part of the decanal. And in this case the curves should be mostly like the decane case (similar peak heating rate and a NTC period as of decane), since they have a similar part of 9-carbon chain. However, in Figs. 3 and 5, the two curves are completely different. Therefore, the only peak of decanal could only be the “second period of exotherm” as the case of decane, namely the “HTO peak”. It was a closed-type test; thus, the reaction details are hard to confirm. Further experiments must be conducted to confirm this observation. The oxidation onset temperature of 1-decanal was measured to be much lower than those of n-decane and 1-decanol. The activation energy is defined by the Arrhenius equation [23,24] as the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur. When the sample temperature increases, the molecule energy increases, and the molecule movement becomes faster. The activation energy for the 1-decanal oxidation is much lower than those of n-decane and 1-decanol considering the low oxidation onset temperature of 1-decanal. The HTO happened after the LTO; therefore, when the aldehydes were generated after the NTC reactions, the energy was already sufficient for them to start the oxidation. The observation showed that when simulating the hydrocarbon oxidation, the activation energy of aldehydes should be lower than that of alkanes. If an AIP is designed to utilize the HTO reactions, the key might not be the activation energy of aldehydes. The oxygen concentration and the aldehyde quantity before the HTO should be considered more when designing an AIP."
10,1-Decanol–crude oil mixture tests,"4.2 1-Decanol–crude oil mixture tests A clear trend of decreasing in temperate rate in the early time exotherm can be observed when mixing 1-decanol with crude oil (Figs. 8–11). By contrast, when comparing the late time exotherm, a higher 1-decanol content in the mixture resulted in a much faster self-heating rate, as shown in Figs. 8-10. During the pure n-decane test and the pure 1-decanol test, the 1-decanol sample showed a much lower self-heating rate than that of n-decane during the first exotherm period (LTO). Conversely, it showed a similar peak self-heating rate as n-decane during the second exotherm peak on the self-heating rate curves. The 1-decanol content in the crude oil had a negative impact on the early time exotherm (LTO). The total sample weight was 2.3 g. Increasing the 1-decanol volume would decrease the crude oil volume in the sample. As shown in Fig. 7, most of the hydrogens were on the alkyl groups. Therefore, increasing the 1-decanol content decreased the alkanes in the 1-decanol–crude oil mixture. According to our previous study [25,26], when charging 2.3 g of crude oil in the ARC sample vessel, the oxygen should be limited for the reactions. Therefore, for the LTO reactions, not all alkanes can be converted to alcohols. Increasing the initial 1-decanol content should result in more fuel that is readily available for HTO reactions. The presented tests showed that for the tested decanol-oil mixtures, the generated enthalpy during the LTO period was enough for the NTC reaction consumption because the higher 1-decanol content in the sample resulted in a faster HTO exotherm during the ARC tests. Thus, if the LTO enthalpy is high enough, more alcohols should be favorable for the oxidation process because more fuel would be available for the HTO reactions. According to the presented mixture tests, the following aspects are suggested for consideration during the designing phase of an AIP: a. oxygen amount required for the LTO reactions; b. initial alkane and alcohol contents to judge if the crude oil is pro-LTO or pro-HTO; and c. self-heating test for evaluating if the LTO enthalpy would be enough for the NTC reactions (if the LTO enthalpy is enough for the NTC, the HTO peak should appear on the self-heating rate curve)."
11,1-Decanal–crude oil mixture tests,"4.3 1-Decanal–crude oil mixture tests Figs. 3–5 depict that the activation energy of 1-decanal is way lower than those of n-alkane and 1-decanol because it has the lowest oxidation onset temperature. As can be seen in Fig. 13, one can conclude that the higher the aldehyde content in the mixture, the lower the oxidation onset temperature. These measured oxidation onset temperatures were only the appeal onset temperatures. The ARC has a minimum detectable temperature change accuracy of 0.002 °C/min. Therefore, any self-heating rate lower than this would not be detected. Some oxidation reactions may still happen after the sample temperature reaches 60 °C and before the detected onset temperature. An additional 75% 1-decanal test was conducted. Fig. 17 plots the oxidation onset temperatures. Fig. 17 clearly shows that the oxidation onset temperatures of the 1-decanal–crude oil mixtures almost linearly decreased with the increase of the 1-decanal fraction in the mixture. Moreover, the typical crude oil oxidation should only have two exothermic periods [4,17,26]. However, three distinctive periods of exotherm appeared when testing the 1-decanal–crude oil mixture (Figs. 14 and 15): an additional fast increase in early LTO self-heating rate. It is inferable from Figs. 13, 16, and 17, that the 1-decanal reacted first, and then the crude oil followed, since the decanal has much lower onset temperature compared to the tested crude oil. The typical oxidation process of crude oil only has two exotherm periods, and the NMR plot of the tested crude oil sample showed almost no aldehyde. Thus, the actual aldehyde fraction in most of the in-situ crude oils might be very low. However, in one field case, a spontaneous ignition happened at the relatively shallow South Belridge heavy oil reservoir in California [27]. Among all our previously tested hydrocarbons [25,26] and the hydrocarbons tested herein, 1-decanal alone or 1-decanal added to crude oil can decrease the measured oxidation onset temperature to approximately 60 °C. If the heavy oil in the South Belridge field has a high aldehyde content, a spontaneous crude oil ignition can be achieved at a relatively low reservoir temperature condition. Based on the three periods of the reaction shown in Figs. 14 and 15, if there would be any aldehydes naturally existing in crude oil, those aldehydes could act as the natural ignition enhancers to provide energy for the alkane oxidation onset. Furthermore, the activation energy of aldehydes is lower than that of alkanes; hence, when the aldehydes are generated by the NTC reactions, they should also be ready for the HTO reactions. Therefore, the following aspects should be considered if an AIP is aimed at the HTO of crude oil: a. aldehyde quantity that can be generated after the NTC period; and b. oxygen concentration at the end of the NTC period."
12,Conclusions,"This study examined the roles of alkane, alcohol, and aldehyde for the AIP by testing n-decane, 1-decanol, and 1-decanal in a closed ARC for self-heating behaviors. We draw the following conclusions from the obtained results: a. According to previous studies and the tests conducted herein, alkanes, alcohols, and aldehydes are in the same oxidation chain, and their oxidation behavior can be explained by using the hydrocarbon oxidation chain theory. b. Alkanes mainly contribute to the LTO exotherm. Aldehydes are the fuel for the HTO reactions and have the lowest oxidation activation energy among the three tested types of hydrocarbons. If the generated enthalpy is enough for the NTC, more alcohols are favorable for the oxidation to achieve the HTO. c. A relatively low spontaneous ignition temperature can be achieved if there would be any aldehydes in the crude oil. The aldehyde contents in the in-situ crude oil could act as natural ignition agents for the oxidation of other hydrocarbons. The functional groups of hydrocarbons are important for analyzing their self-heating behaviors. For future AIP studies, considering the functional groups should be a good path for the successful design or analysis of the AIP."
