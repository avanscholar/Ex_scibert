0,Introduction,"Controlling the surfactant morphology is a key factor in technologies across the economy, from healthcare and cosmetics to petroleum extraction and processing [1–6]. Surfactants can form a variety of self-assembly bodies depending on the balance of various non-covalent interactions such as columbic, dipole-dipole, hydrogen bonding, and dispersion forces, in a system. Furthermore, surfactants can act as cleansers, foam boosters, solubilizers, emulsifiers, or suspending agents. In the personal care industry, perhaps the most widely used surfactant is the anionic sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), otherwise known as sodium laurylsulfate (SLS). Herein, we show that the concentration of the reactant and the degree of ethoxylation can be manipulated to achieve different viscosities and morphologies. SLS is a mixture, consisting of SDS with traces of other substances such as SDS with different degrees of ethoxylation, laurylsulfate, and other compounds. Apart from its low-cost production, SLS is also known for its tendency to cause skin redness and drying to the point that it is commonly used as a positive control irritant in skin irritation studies [7–11]. Because of SLS’s harsh cleansing action, different methods have been developed to produce milder formulations. One method is to increase the degree of ethoxylation to form sodium laureth-x (or lauryl ether-x) sulfate (SLExS), where x represents the number of ethylene oxide groups [12–16]. Various additives are also commonly added to surfactant solutions in the personal care industry to modify the sensory feel by enhancing the lubrication properties [17], adjust rheological characteristics [18], improve drug release properties [19,20], etc. Furthermore, fatty alcohols have also been either added directly to the formulation [21,22] or separately as a pre-treatment [23,24] to enhance transdermal penetration of the drug. Fatty alcohol additives greatly affect the interfacial properties of the formulation because of their influence on molecular packing in the micelle [25]. There are reports on the influence of fatty alcohols on micellar solutions of various surfactants, and how they impact critical micelle concentration (CMC), micelle aggregation number, ionization degree, etc. [26,27]. In addition to micellar solutions, other liquid crystalline phases have been studied as well [28,29]. Industrial grade SLS and SLExS contain a small amount of unreacted lauryl alcohol (LA) and varying degrees of ethoxylation for the ethoxylated surfactant as a result of the manufacturing process. Past studies on fatty alcohols have demonstrated their effects on various surfactant systems; however, none to our knowledge has investigated the effects of residual unreacted alcohols on industrial-grade SLS and SLExS. Furthermore, previous work has been done to fine-tune the rheology of anionic and cationic surfactant-based solutions with medium-chain co-surfactants (C8 to C12) [30] and a mixed fatty alcohol solution [31], while the effects of an individual fatty alcohol, 1-hexadodecanol (cetyl alcohol), on an SDS-based system has also been studied [32]. Despite these studies, to the best of our knowledge, no work has single-variably isolated the effect of ethoxylation on system rheology by keeping the surfactant and fatty alcohol chains the same length. In the present work, we have systematically investigated the structural changes in SLS self-assembly (above CMC) in the presence of LA as a co-surfactant and as a function of the degree of ethoxylation using SLE1S (one ethylene oxide group) and SLE3S (three ethylene oxide groups) (Scheme 1 ). LA was specifically chosen to keep the hydrocarbon chain length same in all systems and thereby remove a variable, thus allowing for the targeted study of head group effects by varying the degree of ethoxylation. High concentrations of LA were also tested to more thoroughly understand its effects on SLS and SLExS self-assembly and determine if any of those effects could be beneficial. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) has previously been used to assess the effect of temperature [33–35], salt species and concentration [36–39], clouding [37,40], interactions with polymers [41–47], and interactions with other (co)surfactants [48,49] on various surfactant systems. The main advantage of SANS over small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is the large contrast in neutron cross-section between hydrogen and deuterium, which allows SANS to selectively elucidate structural information by labeling either the surfactant, water, or alcohol. Using deuterated solvents in SANS provides the desired contrast to elucidate structural information of the assembly body. In recent work, we have successfully used SANS to assess the variations in size and shape of SLS micelles in the presence of the polymers polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) [50]. In the present study, SANS is utilized on the mixed surfactant system consisting of LA and SLS to determine the geometry and morphological transition associated with a self-assembled surfactant system with changes in LA: SLS ratios and as the degree of SLS ethoxylation is varied. A remarkable transition of the system towards a viscoelastic gel phase has been observed at higher LA concentrations. The viscoelastic properties of systems were characterized by rheological measurements, and the intermolecular interactions were assessed with the help of NMR. The present study is of two-fold significance: first, it summarizes the effect of LA and ethoxylation on the surfactant assembly behavior of industrial-grade SLS; second, it simultaneously stimulates the use of ethoxylation and LA to actively engineer the outcome of a formulation in terms of viscosity, morphology and cleansing actions."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials High purity 1-dodecanol (ACS reagent, ≥98.0 %) was used as received from Sigma Aldrich. The surfactants used in this experiment were industrial grade. SLS, SLE1S, and SLE3S in the water at concentrations of 29 w/w%, 70 w/w%, and 28 w/w%, respectively, were all provided by Procter & Gamble, Co. The SLS was sourced from BASF, SLE1S was produced by Chemtrade Intl., and SLE3S was manufactured by P&G. Two forms of D2O were used: 99.9 atom % D2O from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories was used for SANS experiments and D2O with 99.9 atom % Deuterium and 0.05 wt. % 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid, sodium salt obtained from Sigma-Aldrich was used for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments."
3,SANS,"2.2 SANS Samples were prepared by first diluting the surfactant raw material in water to make a stock solution. The proper amount of D2O was then measured out, to which the surfactant stock solution was added. Finally, appropriate molar amounts of LA was added to those specific samples. SANS data for the 50 mM SLS, 50 mM SLE1S, and 50 mM SLE3S were taken on the Bio-SANS beamline at ORNL (Oak Ridge, TN, USA) at 20 °C [51]. The sample-to-detector distances (SDDs) used were 1.1 m and 6.8 m, with a wavelength of 6 Å for both SDDs to cover a q-range of 0.0084 Å−1 < q < 0.8456 Å−1 (where q = [4π/λ]·sinθ, 2θ is the scattering angle, and λ is the wavelength). The SANS data for the 50 mM SLS + 446 mM LA, 50 mM SLE1S + 208 mM LA, and 50 mM SLE3S + 208 mM LA were also taken on the Bio-SANS beamline at 20 °C after its upgrade that added the 2nd detector for wider angular coverage. The SDDs used to collect these data were 1.3 m (wide-angle detector) and 15.5 m small-angle detector), with a wavelength of 6 Å for both SDDs to cover a q-range of 0.0031 Å−1 < q < 0.8422 Å−1. The wavelength spread for all measurements was Δλ/λ ≅ 0.13, and all samples were injected into quartz cells (Hellma Inc., Germany) with a path length of 1 mm. All data from ORNL were reduced in the facility-supplied software, Mantid, to account for corrections such as background scattering subtraction, empty cell scattering subtraction and solvent scattering subtraction, detector sensitivity, and transmission. The reduced data from the 2D position-sensitive detector was then radially averaged to produce the 1D I vs. q data set to an absolute scale. It should be noted that although the 2D data for the 50 mM SLS + 446 mM LA, 50 mM SLE1S + 208 mM LA, and 50 mM SLE3S + 208 mM LA showed a slight degree of anisotropy, the reduced data was radially averaged to produce the 1D data as the degree of anisotropy was not significant. SANS data for the 20 mM SLS + 25 mM LA, 20 mM SLE1S + 25 mM LA, and 20 mM SLE3S + 25 mM LA were taken on the NGB-SANS beamline at NIST Center for Neutron Research (Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The SDDs used were 1.2 m and 5.2 m, with a wavelength of 5 Å for both SDDs and 10 Å for the second SDD to cover a q-range of 0.0034 Å−1 < q < 0.5455 Å−1. Scattering times for the λ =5 Å configurations were 5 min while the λ =10 Å configuration took 10 min. The SANS data for the 50 mM SLS + 208 mM LA, 50 mM SLE1S + 446 mM LA, and 50 mM SLE3S + 446 mM LA were also measured with the NGB-SANS beamline. The SDDs used for these samples were 1.2 m and 4.6 m, with a wavelength of 5 Å for both SDDs and 12 Å for the second SDD to cover a q-range of 0.0032 Å−1 < q < 0.5666 Å−1. The scattering times for the SDD = 1.2 m configuration was 5 min, the SDD = 4.6 m with λ =5 Å configuration was 20 min, and the λ =12 Å configuration was 45 min. Finally, the SANS data for the 50 mM SLS + 25 mM LA, 50 mM SLE1S + 25 mM LA, and 50 mM SLE3S + 25 mM LA were taken on the NGB-SANS beamline as well. The SDDs were 1.15 m, 4.5 m, and 4.75 m, with a wavelength of 5 Å for the first two SDDs and 16 Å for the last SDD to cover a q-range of 0.00315 Å−1 < q < 0.5916 Å−1. The scattering times for the SDD = 1.15 m configuration was 5 min, the SDD = 4.5 m with λ =5 Å configuration was 30 min, and the SDD = 4.75 m and λ =16 Å configuration was 75 min. All NIST samples were injected into pre-assembled titanium sample holders with quartz windows and a 1 mm path length. All measurements were measured at ambient temperature (22 °C∼25 °C) and had a wavelength spread of Δλ/λ ≅ 0.15. Previous SANS studies of the temperature effects on SDS micelles [52] and cationic surfactant micelles [53] indicated that structural changes become significant only with large changes in temperature (30 °C or more). The minor temperature differences due to changes in ambient temperature in the present SANS study are therefore unlikely to cause any significant structural changes. All data collected from NIST was reduced in Igor Pro (WaveMetrics, Portland, OR, USA) using macros developed at NIST [54] to correct for background scattering, empty cell scattering, detector sensitivity, and transmission. The reduced 2D data were radially averaged to produce the 1D I vs. q data, set to absolute scale. The 20 mM SLE1S + 25 mM LA and 20 mM SLE3S + 25 mM LA samples, however, were sector averaged to produce the 1D data because they showed anisotropy. Data analysis was carried out mostly in Igor Pro with the NIST analysis macros, while SasView 3.1.2 (sasview.org) was used when needed. A variety of form factor models were used to fit the data, including uniform ellipsoid [55], dilute lamellar and concentrated lamellar [56] unilamellar vesicle [57] and lamellar paracrystal models [58]. In some instances, two of these models had to be added together in order to fit the data as a mixture system. Some fittings also required the screened coulomb structure factor model [59,60] due to the charged micelles experiencing electrostatic repulsions, which uses a rescaled mean spherical approximation closure to solve the Ornstein-Zernike equation. This structure factor was used in conjunction with the uniform ellipsoid and unilamellar vesicle models when those models were required to analyze the scattering data. The scattering length density (SLD) of the scattering structure was calculated via a weighted average of LA and the surfactant (i.e. SLS, SLE1S, or SLE3S) content in the structure. Likewise, the SLD of the solvent phase was the weighted average of the D2O and H2O. The SLD values were then held constant during the fitting procedure. The SLDs and the parameters used to calculate them can be found in the ESI."
4,NMR,"2.3 NMR Samples were prepared by combining individual surfactants with varying levels/concentrations of dodecanol (25 mM, 50 mM, 100 mM, 207.7 mM, and 445.9 mM). Each composition was prepared in D2O (99.9 atom% D) with an internal standard of 0.05 wt% 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid, sodium salt. Then, samples were allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 24 h before data was collected. All 1H-NMR spectra were obtained using a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker AV-400, Coventry, UK)."
5,Rheological measurements,"2.4 Rheological measurements The Discovery HR-2 (TA Instruments, Deleware, US) was used to characterize the rheological properties of the different surfactant-lauryl alcohol systems. A 40 mm cone-plate steel geometry with 55 mm truncation was used for all experiments. Each sample was subjected to a strain sweep experiment at a temperature of 25 °C, in which the storage (G') and loss (G”) moduli were measured over a strain range of 0.025–100 % at a constant frequency of 1 Hz. In temperature sweep experiments the temperature was raised from 20 °C to 60 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min. At each temperature G’ and G” were recorded at a constant strain of 0.1 % and at a constant frequency of 1 Hz. All samples were allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for at least 24 h before transfer to the rheometer plate before the measurements."
6,SEM,2.5 SEM The surfactant-lauryl alcohol systems were prepared identically to the protocols previously discussed. Each sample was transferred onto a silicon wafer and was immersed in liquid nitrogen before being dried in vacuo for 2 days. The sample was then coated with platinum and investigated with SCIOS SEM/FIB.
7,DSC,"2.6 DSC Gel samples (5∼10 mg) were sealed in hermetic pans prior to analysis. Thermograms were recorded in DSC 2500 (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA) by heating from 20 °C to 80 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min."
8,Results and discussion,
9,SANS,"3.1 SANS SANS was used to study how the surfactant assembly was altered as a function of ethoxylation and LA concentration. Fig. 1 (a–c) shows overlays of SANS data from SLS, SLE1S, and SLE3S with increasing amounts of LA and (d–g) overlays of data from each LA concentration as a function of ethoxylation. Fitted modeling curves for each data set are also shown in Fig. 1. The data is offset in each overlay to improve clarity. Differences in the high-q scattering is primarily due to the data being offset, but would also be somewhat affected by variations in the hydrogen concentration, while differences in the low-q region are influenced by the scattering structure. When SLS, SLE1S, or SLE3S are alone, they form prolate ellipsoids as shown in our previous work [50], which is also consistent with the current data (see Supporting Information). As the LA content in each system increases, each system (with and without ethoxylation) becomes more lamellar in nature as seen in Fig. 1a–c. This is evidenced by the strong scattering intensity with a decay proportional to I ∼ q−2 in the 20 mM SLS + 25 mM LA system, indicative of flat sheets according to the power law of 2 [61]. Intense Bragg peaks in all the other systems containing LA suggests the presence of periodical structures. As the degree of ethoxylation increases for each concentration of LA (Fig. 1d–g), lamellar structures with different repeating spaces appear to form, and the structures of the non-ethoxylated vs. ethoxylated systems appear different. In particular, the 20 mM SLE1S and 20 mM SLE3S systems seem to have dense lamellar systems based on the multiple intense Bragg peaks in their scattering curves, while the 20 mM SLS scattering curve does not have such peaks (Fig. 1d). Additionally, the peak positions vary with the degree of ethoxylation at each LA concentration, indicating that the degree of ethoxylation affects the lamellar spacing. To obtain quantitative results on the data, a variety of models were used to fit the SANS curves via least squares regression. The 50 mM SLS, SLE1S, and SLE3S data were fitted to a uniform ellipsoid model with a screened coulomb structure factor. The 20 mM SLS + 25 mM LA data was modeled by a dilute lamellar model. The 20 mM SLE1S + 25 mM LA and 20 mM SLE3S + 25 mM LA data were modeled by the concentrated lamellar model. The 50 mM SLS + 25 mM LA, 50 mM SLE1S + 25 mM LA, and 50 mM SLE3S + 25 mM LA were modeled with a summed concentrated lamellar + uniform ellipsoid with screened coulomb structure factor model. The 50 mM SLE1S + 208 mM LA and 50 mM SLE3S + 208 mM LA data were modeled by a summed concentrated lamellar + unilamellar vesicle with screened coulomb structure factor model. Finally, the 50 mM SLS + 208 mM LA, 50 mM SLS + 446 mM LA, 50 mM SLE1S + 446 mM LA, and 50 mM SLE3S + 446 mM LA data were modeled by a lamellar paracrystal model. Each lamellar model has specific assumptions. The dilute lamellar model and concentrated lamellar model assume the lamellae to be randomly dispersed and treat them as a powder average, but the concentrated lamellar model also assumes that there are strong interactions between the bilayers. The lamellar paracrystal model assumes that the structure is a stack of bilayers that are infinite in the lateral dimension, and treats the stack as a paracrystal to account for the repeated spacing. The broad q range in SANS covers a large range of hierarchical structure of the length scale from hundreds of nanometers to a few nanometer, therefore a single model may not describe all the structures features at times. Care was taken to maximize the quality of the model fit to the peaks in each data set. If the low-q scattering and the peaks could not be fitted well at the same time, then the low-q region was excluded from the fitting range to prioritize the peak fitting as the intermediate to higher q region peaks represent more interesting internal structure. The fits to the data and the fitting results for each data set can be found in the SANS section of the Supporting Information. Table 1 summarizes the structural information and model used for each data set. From the fitting results in Table 1, it is clear that ethoxylation and LA content cause noticeable changes in the self-assembly. For surfactant-only systems, SLE1S and SLE3S both formed more elongated prolate ellipsoids than the non-ethoxylated SLS did, and the micelle volume increased with increasing degree of ethoxylation due to the greater head group size. At 20 mM surfactant + 25 mM LA, the two ethoxylated systems formed denser lamellar structures compared to the SLS system. The analysis also indicated the formation of multiple structures in some systems—all three 50 mM surfactant + 25 mM LA systems were composed of a mixture of ellipsoids and lamellae, and increasing the LA content to 208 mM for the 50 mM SLE1S and SLE3S systems caused unilamellar vesicles and lamellae to form. Increasing the LA concentration in the 50 mM SLS system to 208 mM, on the other hand, caused lamellar paracrystals to form, while further increasing the LA concentration to 446 mM caused the bilayer spacing to decrease and the number of bilayers to increase in the paracrystal. Once the LA concentration reached 446 mM in the 50 mM SLE1S and SLE3S systems, they also formed lamellar paracrystal structures with a similar number of bilayers as the SLS + 208 mM LA system. This suggests that if the LA concentration were even higher in the ethoxylated systems, then more bilayers would have formed and the spacing between them would have decreased as it did in the 50 mM SLS + 446 mM LA system. Given the large distance between the bilayers and the small number of bilayers that the SLS + 208 mM LA and SLE1S/SLE3S + 446 mM LA systems had, it is possible that these systems consisted of oligolamellar vesicles, where small vesicles were enclosed inside larger vesicles [49,58]. When the LA concentration increased to 446 mM for the SLS system, the vesicles may no longer have been stable and converted to stacks of lamellae [58]. This would explain the decreasing bilayer spacing and increasing bilayer number in the SLS system as the LA concentration increased from 208 mM to 446 mM. At 446 mM LA, increasing ethoxylation can be correlated with the lamellar spacing and bilayer thickness. Although it is clear that the surfactants become longer as more ethoxy groups are added and thus cause the thicker bilayers, the bilayer thicknesses are still thinner than what would result from fully extended surfactant monomers. For SLS this is due to the hydrocarbon tail taking on different conformations and thereby providing more entropy to the system [49]. For SLE1S and SLE3S, on the other hand, their extended head groups have a greater number of configurations that most likely contributed to the thinner than expected bilayers, in addition to the effects of tail group configurations. It is not clear why the lamellar spacing would increase with the degree of ethoxylation at 446 mM LA. The larger spacing in the ethoxylated systems may have to do with the size and curvature of the outer vesicle vs. that of the inner vesicle of the oligolamellar structure. For surfactant-alone systems, the SANS data suggests an increase in size of ellipsoids as a function of ethoxylation which in turn explains the lower skin penetration and mildness of ethoxylated surfactants. The colloidal domain ranges from only ellipsoids in the absence of LA to densely packed lamellar paracrystals at sufficiently high LA concentrations as the endpoint, with a variety of intermediate transition structures in the mixed-surfactant + LA systems. Addition of LA to all three surfactants causes an overall increase in micellar size along with presence of other transition structures. Interestingly, SLS exclusively forms lamellar paracrystals at a lower LA concentration, demonstrating that merely ethoxylating the head group strongly influences the phase behavior of surfactant. However, the difference between one ether group (SLE1S) and three (SLE3S) does not significantly change the phase behavior and only affects different aspects of the structure (e.g. bilayer spacing and thickness). Therefore, the SLS system transitions from ellipsoids, to mixed concentrated lamellar and ellipsoids, to oligolamellar vesicles, and finally to lamellar paracrystals as LA content increases. The SLE1S and SLE3S systems also start as ellipsoids and go to mixed concentrated lamellar and ellipsoids, but then transition to mixed concentrated lamellar and unilamellar vesicles, to oligolamellar vesicles, and lastly to lamellar paracrystals as more LA is added. Altering the surfactant to LA ratio from 2:1 to 1:9 results in disappearance of ellipsoidal micelles, and presence of just paracrystals (all vesicles disappear), Interestingly, the number of plates per paracrystal increases from 1.7 to −12.5 in the case of SLS suggesting a more stronger interaction. A 2-fold increase in surfactant amount with respect to LA causes an increase in bilayer thickness by 10Å which results in a more densely packed layer. Also, changing surfactant to LA ratio from 2:1 to 1:4 results in disappearance of ellipsoidal micelles for all three surfactants and presence of unilamellar vesicles as transition structures for ethoxylated surfactants. The above findings are illustrated in Fig. 2 , where the proportion of structures shown at each intermediate stage approximately reflects the proportion of structures as determined by the SANS fits. Due to assumptions made in the SLD calculations and in the models used, it is assumed that LA and the surfactant are uniformly distributed throughout the structures. The 20 mM surfactant + 25 mM LA data are noticeably different in structural trends compared to the other data sets due to the lower surfactant concentration and overall concentration. A denser packing or higher interaction between bilayers within a stack is observed for 20 mM SLE3S + 25 mM LA. Since the tail groups of the surfactants and LA are the same, the changes in structure that are observed can be attributed to the changes in the head group electrostatic and conformational free energies. When comparing the head groups of SLS and LA, both are similarly small in volume while SLS has a single negative charge. Comparing SLE1S to SLS, the SLE1S head group is extended but still has a single charge, meaning that it is not quite as charge dense as SLS’s head group but is more flexible. SLE3S is similar to SLE1S in terms of its head group being less charge dense but more flexible than SLS, except these properties are more exaggerated due to the extra two ether groups. Although the total number of charges present in each system (SLS, SLE1S, and SLE3S) at the given concentration would be the same, the varying head group conformation and size of each surfactant will lead to varying interactions with LA’s head group. As a result, SLS would have the strongest interaction with LA while SLE1S and SLE3S would have weaker interactions with LA. This combination of head group conformation and electrostatic interactions would explain why the SLS + LA system form lamellar paracrystals even at a lower LA concentration."
10,Rheological measurements,"3.2 Rheological measurements The visible changes (Supporting Information Fig. S1–S3) in the viscosity of the systems prompted us to investigate the rheological properties. The rheological behavior not only differs with LA content but also with degrees of ethoxylation. The viscoelastic properties of various systems can be assessed and compared with the help of strain sweep experiment where storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G”) is measured as the function of strain. A greater G' compared to G’’ signifies a gel-like system behavior dominated by solid-like (elastic) character whereas a smaller G’ signifies a sol-like system behavior dominated by liquid-like (viscous) character. The strain point at which the strain-sweep curve deviates from linearity signifies a critical strain, which is the measure of mechanical robustness [62]. The stain sweep curves of various surfactant systems in the presence of varying amounts of LA are summarized in Fig. 3 . Surfactant-only samples (SLS, SLE1S, SLE3S) show very low moduli signifying very low viscosity liquids. With an increase in LA content two significant changes are observed: first, both the moduli increase; and second, G' becomes greater than G” indicating the development of solid-like (elastic) property. In every case, the system with the highest LA content shows the highest storage modulus and most prominent gel-like property as evidenced by the difference between G’ and G”. For intermediate LA contents (50 mM for SLS, 50 mM and 100 mM for SLE1S, 100 mM and 208 mM for SLE3S), the systems show an unusual increase in moduli at lower strain followed by a usual decrease in moduli. This behavior is possibly associated with local rearrangement of the assembled species. Although the addition of LA to SLS, SLE1S, and SLE3S have a similar effect to the viscoelastic properties, there are differences in the minimum concentration of LA to result in a gel-like (G’> G”) system. For SLS, the gel state is achieved at LA concentration of 100 mM, whereas for SLE1S and SLE3S the gel state is achieved at LA concentration of 208 mM and 446 mM-, respectively. Therefore, as the ethoxylation increases more LA is required to achieve the gel-like property. Besides, if the 446 mM concentration is used as a comparison point among the different surfactants (SLS, SLE1S, SLE3S), thenone could see differences in the linear regime. For the system containing 50 mM SLS and 446 mM LA, the linear viscoelastic region is maintained up to 5.85 % strain. However, the linear regime is extended up to only 0.71 % for both the 50 mM SLE1S + 446 mM LA and the 50 mM SLE3S + 446 mM LA. Therefore, with an increase in ethoxylation, the robustness of the system decreases. This is also supported by the temperature sweep experiments, which clearly show the highest gel collapsing temperature for 50 mM SLS + 100 mM LA compared to similar systems with higher degrees of ethoxylations (ESI, Fig S4). In addition, the stability of the gel samples after preparation has been tested with periodic stress sweep experiments over several days (ESI, Fig. S5-S7). Overall, none of the gel samples collapses within 3 days, with some slow modifications over 8 days. The gel systems with highest amount of LA appears to be most stable mechanically. With decrease in LA amount, G’ decreases with time for systems with SLS (ESI, S5). This relationship is not consistent for systems with SLE1S and SLE3S. Ethoxylation is possibly inhibiting the viscoelasticity of the assembled systems which could be a result of the different degrees of involvement of polar and nonpolar parts because of the extended head group size in case of ethoxylation."
11,NMR,"3.3 NMR To understand the intermolecular interaction between LA and SLS/SLE1S/SLE3S, 1H-NMR studies were conducted. Fig. 4 represents the NMR spectra of SLS with an increasing amount of LA. In general, the signals of SLS-only system broaden in the presence of LA signifying association of two species. Interestingly, the signals near to SLS (also to LA) head groups (Scheme 1) are drastically modified because of SLS-LA interaction. While broadening in the hydrophobic domain signifies an association of hydrophobic parts, the shift in NMR signals near the polar head group is associated with more polar nature of the interaction between LA and SLS possibly via hydrogen-bonding [50]. Similar effects are visible for the systems containing either SLE1S or SLE3S with LA (Fig. 5 and Supporting Information, Fig. S8). These results are congruent with similar previously published studies [32]. However, there are also differences in how LA interacts with the surfactant based on the degree of ethoxylation. In the case of SLE1S and SLE3S, the hydrophobic parts are less affected compared to SLS, in the presence of LA. The possible reason could be the strong polar interaction between hydroxyl group of LA and the extended polar head group (based on the degree of ethoxylation) of SLE1S or SLE3S might force the hydrophobic parts to deviate partially from its matching alignment in case of SLS."
12,The structural aspect of the surfactant assembly as the function of LA and ethoxylation,"From the above results, it is clear that LA and ethoxylation both have significant effects on the self-assembly behavior of SLS. As evident from the SANS results, with increasing LA content each system (SLES/SLE1S/SLE3S) transforms from an ellipsoidal micellar structure towards ultimately a lamellar structure via transitioning through mixed lamellar/ellipsoidal, mixed vesicular/lamellar (in the case of the ethoxylated surfactants), and oligolamellar vesicular intermediates. As observed from rheological measurements, a higher LA content facilitates gel formation, which signifies the importance of lamellar structure in gel formation. The SEM micrographs of the systems, containing 208 mM and 446 mM LA, (Supporting Information, Fig. S9) support the lamellar structure as no one-dimensional growth (fibrillar) has been seen. The structural transformation in the presence of LA is initiated by the intense interaction of LA with SLS/SLE1S/SLE3S resulting in a co-assembly. Both the polar head group and hydrophobic parts are involved in the interaction as evident from NMR signal broadening. Close matching in hydrocarbon chain length of surfactant (SLS/SLE1S/SLE3S) with co-surfactant (LA) facilitates such a co-assembly. However, the involvement of polar head groups in the co-assembly becomes more significant with the increase in ethylene oxide groups. A hydrogen-bonding interaction between the hydroxyl group of LA and the sulfate group of SLS is considered responsible. Increasing the degree of ethoxylation, on the other hand, does enhance the polar interaction, but it also compromises the LA-surfactant hydrophobic interaction due to deviation from molecular alignment. This phenomenon shifts the critical LA content for forming a lamellar structure to a higher value. The increase in head group size with degree of ethoxylation also results in a decrease in charge density, such that SLS has the most charge-dense head group and SLE1S's and SLE3S's head groups are less charge dense even though each head group has −1 charge. This would also influence how strongly each surfactant head group can interact with LA's OH group. In summary, the presence of LA facilitates lamellar structure formation because of LA-surfactant interaction, which is also evident from DSC experiments. The sharpest endothermic peak appears in the DSC thermograms with the systems having highest amount of LA (ESI, Fig. S10). This implies significant ordering of the systems facilitated by presence of LA. Although enhancing the polar interaction via ethoxylation increases the storage modulus of the system, the gel-like character is most dominant in the case of the SLS-LA system where the involvement of hydrophobic domains is highest."
13,Conclusion,"In conclusion, a significant and consistent structural rearrangement can be observed for the surfactant SLS as a function of ethoxylation and added LA content. The systems with SLS, SLE1S, and SLE3S all turn to gel at a high LA content. In the presence of LA, the surfactant systems switch from ellipsoid micellar towards a highly ordered lamellar packing via vesicular and mixed vesicular/lamellar intermediate morphology. The ethoxylation, on the other hand, shifts the critical LA content for a distinct morphological transition towards a higher value. The balance between the contribution from hydrophobic and polar interactions operating with systems driven by the chain length, head groups, and hydrogen bonding formation was found to be crucial in facilitating the transition. The present study is the first systematic report on the influence of residual chemical components on the fate of the self-assembly behavior of an industrially important surfactant system. Therefore, firstly, the present findings will offer a deeper understanding of contributions from residual components present in industrial materials, and secondly, the engineering of such residual chemicals to sequentially alter the rheology and morphology of the surfactant system, can offer a new tool to optimize the product formulation."
