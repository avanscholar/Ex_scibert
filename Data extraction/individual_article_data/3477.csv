0,Introduction,"The catalytic reduction of aromatic ketones is a reaction of considerable interest, since it leads to the production of alcohols used as intermediates in organic synthesis, in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, flavors, and others. The hydrogenation of 1-phenyl-ethanone (acetophenone) to its corresponding alcohol (1-phenyl ethanol) obtained by reduction of carbonyl group is a classic example of these reactions [1,2]. However, the selective hydrogenation of aromatic ketones is not easy due to the variety of products that can be obtained, both for the hydrogenation of CO group and/or the aromatic ring as well as for the hydrogenolysis of alcohols generated in the first reaction step. In general, reduction of unsaturated carbonyl compounds is usually carried out using supported metal catalysts. Monometallic systems including Pd, Pt, Rh, Ag, Ni and Ru have been employed in acetophenone hydrogenation [3,4]. Rh-based catalysts, supported over C, allowed to obtain a selectivity to unsaturated alcohol in about 70%, using moderate pressure [5]. Acetophenone hydrogenation over Ni/SiO2 and Ni/Y catalysts resulted in high selectivity to phenylethanol (about 70%). However, in some of them the conversion was less to 10% [1]. Pt is one of the most employed metals in the hydrogenation of carbonyl and phenyl groups. Thereby, Cheng et al. have been used Pt/SiO2 catalyst like a model to study acetophenone hydrogenation. These authors have been studied the adsorbed species on Pt reduced by IR spectroscopy [4]. As will be discussed later, competitive hydrogenation between the carbonyl and phenyl groups, and therefore the reaction selectivity, depends of adsorption mode of acetophenone molecule on metallic surface. It is well known that the use of bimetallic systems may be advantageous to achieve higher activity, stability and/or selectivity to the desired product [3,6]. Bimetallic catalysts such as Ru-Cr, Rh-Sn and Ni-Pt have been employed in the hydrogenation of acetophenone in liquid phase [3]. In the last case, bimetallic system produced an increase in the stability; however the selectivity to unsaturated alcohol is lower than achieved with monometallic catalyst [7]. There are different strategies for obtaining bimetallic systems [8]. One of the methodologies derived from Organometallic Surface Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M). These techniques allow to prepare controlled catalytic phases, by reaction of a supported transition metal with an organometallic compound as M′R n (M′=Sn, Pb, Ge, Sb; R=Me, Et, Bu, etc.; n =3, 4). These interactions lead to catalytic systems with good properties which have better activity and selectivity than the catalysts prepared by conventional methods [9]. In our research group, we have vast experience in the preparation of bimetallic catalysts based on Pt, Rh and Ni modified SnBu4 using n-heptane or n-decane as a solvent. These systems proved to be active and selective in a wide range of hydrogenation reactions of interest in fine chemistry [10–12]. The hydrogenation of ketones derived from acetophenone has been much less studied. It has been reported in the literature the hydrogenation of p-hydroxyacetophenone, o-methylacetophenone and 2-methylpropyl-acetophenone on Ni-based catalysts, however very low conversions have been achieved [1]. There are a few works about the influence of substituents of aromatic ring on activity and selectivity, but they study primarily enantioselective hydrogenations [13]. In this paper, we propose to study the hydrogenation of 1-(phenyl) ethanone (AP), 1-(4-metoxyphenyl) ethanone (4-MeOAP), 1-(4-chlorophenyl) ethanone (4-ClAP) and 1-(2-metylphenyl) ethanone (2-MeAP) using PtSn and Pt catalysts supported on silica. The objective is to analyze the influence of the chemical nature of the substituents groups on the aromatic ketones ring, as has been reported in literature that these groups can influence the selectivity and/or catalytic activity [14]."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of the catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of the catalysts The Pt/SiO2 monometallic catalyst was prepared by ionic exchange. The SiO2 (Evonik, 180m2/g) used as support was previously functionalized by treating it with an ammonia solution of pH 10.6, under continuous stirring for 30min at room temperature. The resulting solid was contacted with an aqueous solution of the precursor, Pt(NH3)4Cl2 (Aldrich), which has the appropriate concentration to obtain 1wt.% of Pt in the final catalyst. After 24h of exchange, the solid was separated by filtration, dried in an oven at 105°C, calcined in air at 500°C and subsequently reduced in H2 at 500°C for 2h. The catalyst so obtained was designated Pt. For obtaining the bimetallic PtSn systems, techniques derived from Surface Organometallic Chemistry of Metals (SOMC/M) were used. These techniques consist of a controlled surface reaction between a reduced monometallic catalyst (Pt) and a solution of an organometallic compound (SnBu4) in a paraffinic solvent. In this work, bimetallic systems with Sn/Pt atomic ratios 0.2 and 0.8 were prepared; those systems have been designated PtSn0.2 and PtSn0.8, respectively. The reaction between the monometallic catalyst and the organotin compound solution was carried out under a H2 atmosphere for 4h. The temperature used for the reaction was 90 and 120°C for the preparation of the PtSn0.2 and PtSn0.8 systems, respectively. In the first case, n-heptane was used as solvent while for the catalyst with the highest tin content, n-decane was employed. The bimetallic systems obtained were then washed with n-heptane in flowing N2, dried in an oven at 105°C and finally reduced at 500°C in H2 flow for 2h."
3,Catalysts characterization,"2.2 Catalysts characterization The Pt content of the catalysts was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (Varian Spectra AA55). The amount of Sn present in the catalysts was measured by gas chromatography analysis of the solution containing the organometallic compound, as a function of reaction time, using a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph, equipped with a FID detector and a Factor Four (VF-1ms, 15m×0.25mm ID DF=0.25) capillary column. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) tests were performed on an instrument built in the laboratory, equipped with a thermal conductivity detector, using a mixture having a composition of 5% H2 in N2 at a flow of 25mL/min. The tests were conducted from 20 to 850°C with a heating rate of 10°C/min. For the measurement of H2 adsorption the method of the static volumetric chemisorption at room temperature was used, employing an instrument from Advanced Scientific Designs Inc., USA. The particle size distribution of the solids was determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in a JEOL 100 CX microscope with a resolution of 6Å and an accelerating voltage of 100kV. The samples were prepared by its suspension in bidistilled water and subsequent dispersion in an ultrasonic bath. Analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a multi-technical system (SPECS) equipped with a dual Mg/Al X-ray source and a PHOIBOS 150 hemispherical analyzer operating in FAT (fixed analyzer transmission) mode. Spectra were obtained with an energy flow of 30eV, an Al-Kα X-ray source operating at 100W and 10kV and at a pressure of the analysis chamber lower than 5×10−7 Pa. Data processing was performed with the XPS Casa program (Casa Software Ltd., UK). C1s signal that appears at 284.6eV was used as reference."
4,Hydrogenation of aromatic ketones,"2.3 Hydrogenation of aromatic ketones The ketones chosen for the present study were 1-(phenyl) ethanone (AP), 1-(4-metoxyphenyl) ethanone (4-MeOAP), 1-(4-chlorophenyl) ethanone (4-ClAP) and 1-(2-metylphenyl) ethanone (2-MeAP). Hydrogenation reactions of the aromatic ketones were conducted in a batch reactor at 80°C and a H2 pressure of 1MPa. In each catalytic test, 0.25g of catalyst, a substrate concentration of 0.07M and 2-propanol as solvent were used. The progress of the reaction was followed by gas chromatography on a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph equipped with a CP wax 52 CB (30m, 0.53mm ID) capillary column and a FID detector. The products were identified by GC/MS on a Shimadzu QP5050 instrument with a SUPELCO SPBTM-5 (30m, 0.25mm ID) capillary column."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Results of catalysts characterization,"3.1 Results of catalysts characterization The catalysts Pt and PtSn/SiO2 were characterized by atomic absorption, CO and H2 chemisorption, temperature-programmed reduction and transmission electron microscopy. The results are shown in Table 1 . For monometallic catalysts preparation, the impregnation method by cation exchange was selected. This method allows to obtain reproducible systems with high dispersions (H/Pt=0.65, CO/Pt=0.55). This last feature is very important for obtaining bimetallic catalysts from controlled surface reactions. The TPR assays results obtained for Pt catalyst system evidenced the presence of two peaks: one at about 250°C and another at 450°C. According to the literature, the low temperature peak can be assigned to the presence of Pt(IV) species, originated during the calcination pretreatment. The high temperature peak could be assigned to species of the type Pt(OSi) y n − y (n =2+ or 4+), formed through the interaction of metallic precursor and the support [15]. The systems PtSn were prepared by a controlled surface reaction between the monometallic catalyst, previously reduced, and a solution of SnBu4 in a paraffinic solvent. The reaction occurs in two stages. In the first, a system with organotin moieties anchored to the surface is obtained. In the second stage, at highest temperature, the organic fragments are eliminated and a bimetallic system is formed. The following equations represent the above-mentioned processes: (1) Pt/SiO2 + ySnBu 4 + xy/2H2 →Pt(SnBu4− x )y/SiO2 + xyBuH (2) Pt(SnBu4− x )/SiO2 +(4− x)y/2H2 → PtSn y /SiO2 +(4− x)yBuH In the present work, catalysts with atomic ratios Sn/Pt of 0.2 and 0.8 were prepared. Regarding the first atomic ratio, n-heptane was used as solvent and the reaction proceeded at 90°C. As regards the catalyst with higher tin content, n-decane was used as solvent and 120°C as reaction temperature. The stoichiometry of the bimetallic catalyst was determined by chromatographic analysis, from the difference between the initial concentration of the organometallic solution and the concentration after four reactions hours [16]. Blank tests performed on the support demonstrated the specificity of the reactions which take place during the preparation of bimetallic catalysts through SOMC/M techniques, concluding that amounts of organotin modifier on SiO2 were not detected. TEM results for the three catalysts prepared are shown in Table 1. As can be seen, in all cases the mean particle size is about 2nm. This value remains almost constant for the bimetallic catalysts, indicating that the addition of tin does not practically affect the particle size distribution with respect to the monometallic system. These results, consistent with other preliminary work, show the high specificity of the preparation method of bimetallic catalysts (SOMC/M). In the same way, tin addition decreases the value of chemisorbed H2 (Table 1). In Table 2 it is reported the binding energies (BE) of the Pt 4f7/2 and Sn 3d5/2 levels for Pt/SiO2, PtSn0.2 and PtSn0.8 catalysts. For all the catalysts, the region corresponding to Pt 4f7/2 showed a single peak, which is characteristic of platinum in the metallic state [17]. It can also be seen that the BE undergoes a shift from 71.6eV for the monometallic catalyst to 71.1 and 70.8eV for PtSn0.2 and PtSn0.8 systems, respectively. The increase in the electronic density of platinum leads to the formation of polarized states of Pt δ− and Sn δ+, which would be important in the chemisorption of reagents containing double CO. This fact is indicative of the existence of an electronic effect of tin over platinum, in agreement with previous results obtained in studies performed with PtSn catalysts supported, prepared by SOMC/M techniques [18,19]. The Sn 3d5/2 spectra for the bimetallics PtSn0.2 and PtSn0.8 present two bands, one centered at ca. 484eV which can be ascribed to reduced tin, and another one at higher BE (486.3 and 487.3eV for PtSn0.2 and PtSn0.8, respectively), which is attributed to oxidized tin (Sn(II) and Sn(IV)) [17,20]. On the other hand, both bimetallic samples have similar Sn(0)/Sntotal ratio (Table 2); the Sn(0)/Pt ratio increases when the amount of tin increases [16]. The presence of metallic tin in bimetallic catalysts is indicative of the existence of bimetallic PtSn phases (even alloys); as it has been readily assessed by EXAFS analysis performed on analogous systems as the ones here employed [18]. Tin oxidized species may be covering the metal particles in the metal-support interface."
7,Hydrogenation reaction,"3.2 Hydrogenation reaction Fig. 1 shows the main products from the hydrogenation of 1-(phenyl) ethanone (AP) and its derivatives. As can be seen, the hydrogenation of the CO leads to the production of the corresponding aromatic alcohols, which are usually the desired product. Furthermore, if the aromatic ring is reduced, saturated ketones are produced. Finally, the saturated alcohols are obtained by the hydrogenation of either of the products above. Other possible reaction products are ethyl benzene and ethyl cyclohexane, and their substituted derivatives. The objective of this paper is to analyze the influence of the presence of substituents on the aromatic ring on the activity and selectivity achieved. For this reason, AP derivatives with substituents in different ring positions and/or electronic properties have been selected. Both effects would have influence at the adsorption mode on the metal surface. In this way, the results obtained can be explained from a balance between steric and electronic effects, result of presence of substituent on the aromatic ring. The ketones selected for this work are AP, 2-MeAP, 4-MeOAP and 4-ClAP. As can be seen, the substituents of two of the ketones are in para- position and therefore far from the CO group, whereas in the 2-MeAP the substituent is located very close to this group. As for the electrical characteristics, –CH3 (–Me) and –OCH3 (–OMe) groups are electron donors, while the –Cl group is an electron acceptor. Both effects would have influence at the adsorption mode on the catalyst surface. It is important to emphasize that, in all the cases mentioned in this work, the reaction is initiated by the hydrogenation of the CO group. The change of the reaction mixture composition as a function of time for the hydrogenation of AP, 2-MeAP, 4-MeOAP and 4-ClAP is shown in Figs. 2–5 , respectively. As can be seen, both the monometallic catalyst systems as well as PtSn initially formed 1-(phenyl) ethanol and its corresponding derivatives. As will be discussed further below, the figures show that the presence of tin produces changes in the activity and selectivity obtained. In Table 3 , the initial reaction rate and selectivity to the desired products (to 50% conversion), for the aromatic ketones and the catalysts studied, are reported. The different ways that the ketone molecules can approach the metal surface could explain the results. According to reported by Cheng et al., there are two preferential modes of adsorption of AP molecule on Pt surface [4]. One of them considers that the molecule of 1-(phenyl) ethanone approaches to the metal surface through the oxygen of the CO group (Fig. 6a) and the aromatic ring, which is parallel to it, is susceptible to attack dissociated hydrogen on metal. The other mode of adsorption contemplates that the carbonyl group interacts with Pt via π electrons and the aromatic ring is tilted with respect to the metal surface (Fig. 7a). In accordance with what was stated in the previous paragraph, for the monometallic catalyst, it is expected that the presence of electron donor groups (–CH3 and –OCH3) (Fig. 6b and c) increase the electronic repulsion between the ring and the metal surface and both favor the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group, compared with the AP. The selectivity results reported in Table 3 for the catalyst based on Pt shows one consequences of this. For 2-MeAP y 4-MeOAP the aromatic alcohol selectivity is superior to that achieved for the same AP conversion (74, 75 and 63%, respectively, at 50% conversion). On the other hand, it is expected that the electronic effect of substituents electron donors causes an increase in the initial reaction rate to AP, considering that we have observed that the hydrogenation starts by the attack to the CO. In this way, in Table 3 can also be seen that the initial rate of hydrogenation for 4-MeOAP is higher than for AP. However, it is observed for the 2-MeAP a decrease in the initial activity respect to unsubstituted ketone. In Fig. 7b it can be seen that the methyl group in ortho- position exerts a steric impediment, which could be responsible for the decrease in the observed rate for this substrate. This geometric impediment would have less significance in the case of the substituents in the para- position, furthest from CO (Fig. 7c and d). For the 4-ClAP, the molecule has an electron attractor group (–Cl) to favor the adsorption by the aromatic ring (Fig. 6d). In Table 3 can be seen that this fact affects both the activity and selectivity to the desired product. Thus, the initial reaction rate is less than half that achieved for AP (69 and 156μmolgPtsup−1 s−1, respectively). Regarding to target product selectivity, the observed value was lower than the corresponding unsubstituted ketone (55 and 63%, respectively, 50% conversion). As is known, the addition of a more electropositive metal on the Pt leads to geometric and electronic modifications that affect the activity and selectivity of the catalyst system. On the one hand, the blocking of active sites for hydrogenation can lead to decrease the reaction rate. Furthermore, the presence of electrophilic tin favor polarization of CO group and hence the reduction [3]. Moreover, in our case, the geometric effect could difficult the ring adsorption of the aromatic ketones and modify the selectivity and the initial rate of hydrogenation. As seen in Table 3, selectivity to corresponding unsaturated alcohols increases with the presence of tin for all tested ketones. Moreover it should be noted that the selectivity is higher for the catalyst with higher atomic ratio Sn/Pt (PtSn0.8). This could be attributed to the combination of the mentioned effects above: the CO polarization by electronic effects and/or impediment of adsorption through the ring, by blocking active sites. It is also important to highlight that the most pronounced effect is evident for the hydrogenation of 4-ClAP. In this case, the presence of –Cl (electron-acceptor group) promotes the ring adsorption on the monometallic catalyst surface. Blocking of active sites by the presence of Sn prevents this adsorption mode, leading to a marked increase in selectivity respect to monometallic system. In Table 3, the initial rates for the catalysts PtSn are also reported. As can be seen in this Table, for AP, 2-MeAP and 4-MeOAP, the rate decreases as the Sn content increases, due to the blocking of active sites for hydrogenation. However, as shown in the Table, for 4-ClAP is observed a marked increase in the initial reduction rate. To explain this result we must remember that initially (less than 10% of conversion) the only product formed comes from the hydrogenation of CO. As has already been mentioned, the initial reaction rate for 4-ClAP is about half of the AP, on the monometallic catalyst. This fact can be attributed to the better attraction of the substituted aromatic ring on the metal surface. As some sites are blocked by the Sn, it would be harder to approach to the ring, favoring the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group and, therefore, increasing the initial speed (Fig. 7d). As a summary, in Table 4 can be seen the relationship between initial rate of hydrogenation of 1-(phenyl) ethanone and initial rates of substituted ketones. It can be observed, that in the presence of Sn the rate ratios for different ketones keep the tendency observed for Pt, but the relative rates approach each other with the Sn content increase. As noted above, these results might be due to a combination of steric and electronic effects, as a result of ring substituents."
8,Conclusions,"The main conclusions that can be derived from this study are summarized below: In the hydrogenation of 2-MeAP and 4-MeOAP, employing Pt/SiO2 system, it was observed an increment in the selectivity to aromatic alcohol in relation to the one obtained for AP (74, 75 and 63%, respectively, at 50% of conversion). The initial rate for the hydrogenation of 4-MeOAP was higher than the one achieved for AP, whereas for 2-MeAP it was observed a decrease in the initial activity with respect to the non-substituted ketone. The activity and selectivity to desired product in the hydrogenation of 4-ClAP were lower than those obtained for AP. When Pt-based catalysts modified with SnBu4 were employed for the hydrogenation of aromatic ketones, it was observed an increase in the selectivity to unsaturated alcohol. This fact can be explained from geometric an electronic effects due to the presence of Sn. These effects encourage the interaction through CO, hindering the adsorption of aromatic ring. Finally, it was observed that the rate decreases with the Sn content for the hydrogenation of AP, 2-MeAP y 4-MeOAP. This can be understood through blockage of the active sites for the hydrogenation. For 4-ClAP it was seen a marked increase of the initial reduction rate. In this case, the Sn presence could hinder the ring adsorption, encouraging the carbonyl group hydrogenation and therefore increasing the initial rate."
