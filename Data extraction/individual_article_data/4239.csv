0,Introduction,"Fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal are finite resources considering the proved reserves. Researches on fossil fuels and renewable sources indicate that a shift from fossil sources to renewable alternatives should be supported to prevent both climate change and the possible shortage of energy resources [1]. In addition to the existing renewable resources in use, biomass is an abundant resource for chemical and biofuel production by thermochemical conversion technologies. One of the promising technologies is the gasification of biomass to the H2- and CH4-rich gas in a supercritical water (SCW) medium. Organic compounds such as biomass becomes miscible with SCW due to the relatively lower dielectric constant of it. Also a homogenous reaction environment for gasification is being formed eliminating mass transfer resistances and provides high reaction rates [2]. The hydrothermal gasification of biomass model compounds and real biomasses have been intensively focused on in recent years [3–9]. Since biomass has various constituents and a complex nature to enlighten the degradation of real biomass, many researches have been done on the model compounds such as glucose [5–7,9–12], xylose and xylan [8,13], phenol [11,14], and glycerol [15]. Hao et al. [9] gasified glucose with varying concentrations and sawdust with some CMC (sodium carboxymethylcellulose) at 600–650°C and 22.5–30.0MPa. The complete gasification of 0.1M glucose was achieved with a reaction time of 3.6min at 650°C and 25.0MPa and the sawdust with some CMC has a gasification efficiency of about 95%. Weiss-Hortala et al. [11] investigated the interactions in supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of a lignocellulosic biomass using phenol (substitute for lignin) and glucose (substitute for cellulose). They reported that the amount of gas produced was less than the quantity of the obtained gas with the solutions of each compound. It can be concluded that phenol affects the glucose degradation and interactions between cellulose and lignin reduces gasification yields. Some pioneering studies have been done by research groups around the world with real biomass to contribute to the development of SCWG technology. Yanik et al. [3] worked with eight different types of biomass including lignocellulosic and tannery wastes. It was concluded that the highest gas yields were reached in the gasification of corn stalk and sunflower stalk and the highest amount hydrogen (39.47%) was obtained with tobacco stalk. Yoshida et al. [5] investigated the gasification of cellulose, five lignin reagents and their mixtures, in the presence of a nickel catalyst at 673K and 25MPa. The gasification of rice straw and sawdust as real biomass were also carried out with the same conditions. The interactions between the constituents in the biomass led to lower gasification ratios than expected. Various kinds of lignin show different gasification characteristics due to their typical structures. Williams and Onwudili [6] examined the hydrothermal gasification of cellulose, starch, glucose, and real biomass in the form of Cassava. They highlighted that in evaluating the gasification behaviour of a biomass the chemical structure of the compounds is also significant as the chemical composition of it. Sınag et al. [7] studied with two different biomass feedstocks (phyto mass and zoo mass) and glucose/K2CO3 as a representative of phyto mass at 500°C and 30.0MPa. The protein content of the zoo mass led to a decrease in the yields of H2 and CO2 due to the inhibition of the free radical reactions that form gaseous products. Wood sawdust, rice straw, rice shell, wheat stalk, peanut shell, corn stalk, corn cob, and sorghum stalk were gasified in supercritical water at 923K and 25MPa by Lu et al. [16]. All kinds of biomass feedstock can be gasified successfully in SCW with about a 40% molar fraction of H2. Operating parameters highly affect the hydrogen formation and pressure has a significant effect on the dominate reaction pathway at supercritical temperatures. Guo et al. [16] reported that hydrogen yield and carbon and gasification efficiencies (CE and GE) are not directly proportional with operating pressure at near the critical pressure of water. At relatively high pressures, hydrogen yield, GE and CE increase a little. In the work of Demirbaş [17], supercritical water extraction experiments with fruit shells at a range of 377–477°C and 23–48MPa were performed. The hydrogen yields increase as pressure and temperature increase, also the effect of pressure was found as being dominant [17]. In this paper, the hydrothermal gasification of two types of wood residue (pine tree and fir tree sawdust) was carried out in a batch autoclave reactor at operating conditions of 500–600°C and 20–43.0MPa in the absence and presence of K2CO3. In this regard the effect of reaction temperature and pressure on product efficiencies, gas compositions, and the aqueous product were intensively presented in this work. Since there are not enough comprehensive studies with real biomasses at such a wide range of operating conditions, it will contribute to the literature in this respect. Additionally, a detailed analysis of the aqueous and gaseous products will give some insight about the degradation mechanism of a biomass."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Preparation of the samples,"2.1 Preparation of the samples The wood residues of the pine tree (from İzmir) and fir tree (Black Sea Region) were supplied from different parts of Turkey. The wood residues were dried in the open air and were cut into small pieces. In order to obtain <0.5mm fractions, the samples were ground and sieved. An elemental analyzer was used for the determination of the CHNS/O amounts (CHNS-932 by Leco, MI, USA). The main structural components of the samples were analyzed with the Van Soest method [18]. The proximate, ultimate, and component analysis results are given in Table 1 . The monosaccharide and polysaccharide contents of the biomass were identified on a dry and extractives-removed basis with the method of Sieber [19]. The analysis of the obtained samples was accomplished with an HPLC (HPLC-RI Agilent Technologies, USA) and the results are shown in Table 2 . The solution of K2CO3 (99.0% purity, Sigma–Aldrich) was prepared in a concentration of 10wt.% and as used as the catalyst."
3,The procedure of SCWG experiments,"2.2 The procedure of SCWG experiments A stainless steel batch-type autoclave reactor was used for the hydrothermal gasification experiments. It has an inner volume of 100cm3, maximum operating temperature and pressure of 650°C and 50.0MPa, respectively. The schematic representation of the reactor system and the individual components was given in a previous work [20]. The objected pressures of the experiments were 20.0MPa, 27.5MPa, 35.0MPa, and 42.5MPa. The sample amounts (0.55–1.60g) and the volume of the deionized water, or 10wt.% K2CO3 solution (12.5 times of the biomass amount), were identified to reach the objected pressures at 500°C and 600°C. The reaction pressures were provided with a maximum deviation of ±0.50MPa after performing many pre-experiments at the specified reaction temperature. The feed mixture was placed into the batch autoclave and the air inside it was purged with inert N2 gas. The reactor was sealed tightly and heated at a rate of 8–10K/min to the reaction temperature. It was maintained at this temperature during the reaction time of 1h with a PID controller. The reaction temperature and pressures are given in Table 3 . At the end of the experiment, the reactor was cooled to ambient temperature by means of electric fans. The gaseous product volume was measured with a gasometer within 10% accuracy and the samples for analysis with gas chromatography were taken with gas tight syringes. The product mixture remaining in the reactor in solid and aqueous form was filtered for separation. The pH of the aqueous product was adjusted to approximately 2 by adding 1–2 drops of concentrated sulphuric acid to eliminate the organic acid ionization. The solid residue was dried in the oven at 105°C and the amount was determined in the next day."
4,The analysis of the products,"2.3 The analysis of the products 2.3.1 The analysis of the gaseous product The gaseous products (H2, CO2, CO, and C1–C4 hydrocarbons) were analyzed with gas chromatographic methods with a deviation of ±2%. A gas chromatography (Agilent Technologies HP 7890A, USA) equipped with serially arranged with a Hayesep Q 80/100 mesh (0.5m long×2mm i.d.), a Hayesep Q 80/100 mesh (1.8m long×2mm i.d.), a Molsieve 5A 60/80 mesh (2.4m long×2mm i.d.), a Hayesep Q 80/100 mesh (0.9m long×2mm i.d.), a Molsieve 5A 60/80 mesh (2.4m long×2mm i.d.), a DB-1 (pre-column), and HP-Plot Al2O3 S (25m long×0.32mm i.d.) columns. Two thermal conductivity detectors (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID) were serially connected using a special adapter. It was calibrated with a standard gas mixture supplied by HatGaz Company in Kocaeli, Turkey. The oven temperature programme was: 60°C isothermal for 1min, 20°Cmin−1 to 80°C, and 30°Cmin−1 to 120°C isothermal for 2.66min. The carrier gas used was Helium. 2.3.2 The analysis of the aqueous product The total organic carbon (TOC) content of the aqueous product was measured with a TOC analyzer (Shimadzu TOC-VCPH, Japan). A high performance liquid chromatography (Shimadzu LC-20A series HPLC, Japan) was used to determine the amounts of the main groups in the aqueous product (aldehydes, ketones, furfurals, carboxylic acids, and phenols). It is equipped with an Inertsil ODS-3 column (250mm length×4.6mm i.d.) and consisted of a DGU-20AS degassing module, an LC-20AT gradient pump, a CTO-10ASVP chromatography oven, and a SPD-20 multi-wavelength ultraviolet detector. The analysis of the calibration standards was repeated 5 times and the calibration curves were prepared by plotting a linear regression of the average response factor versus the analyte concentration. The conditions of the analysis methods are given in a previous work of our research group [4]. The aldehydes and ketones were derivatized to their hydrozone forms with the addition of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine to the aqueous samples. The 2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazone forms of the aldehydes and ketones were separated with reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography using the same method as described in literature [21]. The carbohydrate analysis of the biomass samples was accomplished using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-RI Agilent Technologies, USA equipped with a refractive index detector and two types of columns (Bio-Rad HPX-87 H and a Nucleogel sugar Pb) were used for the identification of the compounds which have very similar chemical structures. 2.3.3 The analysis of solid residue The total organic carbon (TOC) content of the solid residue was measured with the solid sample module (SSM) of the TOC analyzer (Shimadzu TOC-VCPH-SSM-5000A, Japan)."
5,Results and discussion,"In this work, the hydrothermal gasification of two types of wood sawdust (pine tree and fir tree) was performed at 500°C and 600°C and a pressure range of 20.0–42.5MPa. The studies were carried out in the absence and presence of K2CO3 as the catalyst in the batch reactor. The investigated parameters were reaction temperature, pressure, and catalyst. The product efficiencies and the compositions were investigated using the effects of these parameters. Carbon gasification efficiency (g C in gaseous/g C in biomass), carbon liquefaction efficiency (g C in aqueous/g C in biomass), and residue (g C in residue/g C in biomass) were expressed by using the following formulas: Carbon gasification efficiency ( CGE , % ) = ∑ i n i C i ( P V / R T ) M w m × 100 Carbon liquefaction efficiency ( CLE , % ) = T O C a q V ¯ w m × 100 Residue ( RE , % ) = T O C R E κ w m × 100 For accuracy, the experiments were repeated three times with a precision of product efficiencies of about 5%."
6,Product efficiencies and amount of the produced gas,"3.1 Product efficiencies and amount of the produced gas The amount of produced gas (g/kg biomass) and the product efficiencies (CGE, CLE and RE, %) are shown in Table 3 for the pine tree sawdust (PTS) and fir tree sawdust (FTS) at 500°C and 600°C in the absence and presence of K2CO3, respectively. The ratio of the biomass constituents’ determines the efficiency of the hydrothermal gasification due to the gasification characteristics of the structural components. The produced gas amounts in the gasification of PTS at 500°C and 600°C were slightly greater than in the gasification of FTS. This may be explained by the higher extractive and lower lignin content of the PTS. The increasing pressure reduced the amount of the produced gas and CGE while it promoted CLE and RE at specified temperatures. A similar effect with the pressure was observed in a study with 0.45M of glucose at temperature and pressure intervals of 400–600°C and 20.0–42.5MPa [22]. The maximum CGE and produced gas was obtained in the hydrothermal gasification of PTS at 80.9% and 1238.0ggas/kg biomass, respectively at 600°C and 20.0MPa in the presence of K2CO3. The alkali catalyst enhanced the gasification ratio significantly. The catalyst improvement ratios in the amount of gas produced for PTS was 20–25% at 500°C and 9–11% at 600°C. The amount of the gaseous product obtained in the gasification of FTS was improved more efficiently with the catalyst at 29–34% at 500°C and 12–16% at 600°C. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1."
7,The composition of the gaseous product,"3.2 The composition of the gaseous product The gaseous product is basically composed of H2, CO2, CH4, and a little CO, and C2–C4 compounds. The compositions of the gaseous product (mole/kg of biomass) for all cases are given in Figs. 2–5 . The amount of CH4 and C2–C4 compounds significantly increased while H2, CO2, and CO decreased with increasing pressure. The same tendency was observed at 500°C and 600°C, for both feedstocks. The yields of the gaseous products were found higher at 600°C than 500°C for all reaction pressures. The highest yields of hydrogen (YH) obtained in the presence of a catalyst at 600°C was 27.0mol/kg for PTS and 24.7mol/kg for FTS at reaction pressures of 20.5MPa and 20.3MPa, respectively. The dominant effect was provided with the temperature increase in the YH. As the temperature increased from 500°C to 600°C, the YH increased by 115% in the gasification of PTS and by 79% in the gasification of FTS at the lowest reaction pressures. The alkali catalyst improved the YH with a changing ratio of 31–72% for all cases. Madenoğlu et al. [22] found that the maximum YH was obtained at 600°C and 20.0MPa and it increased from 2.25 to 3.87molH2/mol glucose in the presence of K2CO3. In the study of Kruse [23] with pyrocatechol as the representative compound of lignin an increase in the YH and a decrease in the yield of methane (YM) were reported with increasing temperature (from 600°C to 700°C) and decreasing pressure (from 400 bars to 200 bars). In addition, they have conducted experiments with the addition of KOH and reached higher yields of H2 and CO2 and lower yields of CO via a water gas shift reaction: CO+H2O↔H2 +CO2 The intermediate steps of the reaction in the presence of alkali salts were investigated by Sinag et al. [24] and proposed as: K2CO3 +H2O→KHCO3 +KOH KOH+CO→HCOOK HCOOK+H2O→KHCO3 +H2 2KHCO3 →CO2 +K2CO3 +H2O H2O+CO→HCOOH→H2 +CO2 The maximum methane yields with all cases were 11.7mol/kg PTS and 11.2mol/kg FTS at 600°C and 43.0MPa in the presence of a catalyst. The YM increased with a changing ratio of 8–44% with the effect of catalyst in all cases. As the pressure decreased, the YM increased for both feedstocks."
8,The composition of the aqueous product,"3.3 The composition of the aqueous product The yields of the mainly produced and identified aqueous products are given in Figs. 6 and 7 formed with the hydrothermal gasification of PTS and FTS in the absence and presence of K2CO3 at 500°C and 600°C in the pressure range of 20.0–43.0MPa. The main groups obtained from the hydrothermal gasification of a biomass were determined as carboxylic acids, furfurals, phenols, and aldehydes in this study as well as in the previous works [24]. The compounds taking place in these groups were analyzed and quantified. To enlighten the reaction pathways from the biomass constituents to the aqueous and gaseous products, the experiments were performed with glucose, fructose, xylose, phenol, and guaiacol as the representative compounds. Sasaki et al. [10] found that cellulose degrades to sugar monomers by hydrolysis, then glucose or fructose form rapidly. Sinag et al. [25] proposed the mechanism of glucose decomposition as two competing pathways of depolymerisation to acids/aldehydes and dehydration to furfurals or phenols. The hydrothermal gasification of fructose with a varying concentration of 4–10wt.% was investigated at a temperature range of 550–700°C, at 25MPa in a continuous flow reactor [26]. According to the aqueous product analysis, the furfurals were detected with carboxylic acids, aldehydes, and ketones in the effluent. The acetic acid and phenols were determined as the non-degraded compounds existing above 650°C. There are quite a few studies with the hemicellulose representatives of xylose and xylan. Yoshida and Matsumura [8] studied the interactions between cellulose, xylan, and lignin and developed a correlation based on the lignin fraction to estimate the gasification efficiency and composition of the gaseous product. Two kinetic models for xylose was offered by Goodwin et al. [13] consisting of a decomposition model to predict the main liquid products and a gasification model to estimate the gaseous product yields and compositions. They observed xylose dehydrated to furfural due to the domination of ionic reactions at or near the near critical conditions of water while pyruvaldehyde and methyl formate formed at higher concentrations as a result of favoured free radical reactions at the supercritical conditions of water. Hydrothermal gasification of glucose (model for cellulose) and/or phenol (model for lignin) was investigated at the temperature range of 400–550°C at 25MPa. They stated that the presence of phenol in the solution decreases the degradation conversion, the hydrogen yield and TOC removal [11]. In the work of [27] the aqueous mixtures of phenol and glucose were used in different proportions to enlighten the effect of lignin inhibition in gasification in a continuous tubular reactor at 400°C and 25.0MPa. The yields of glycolic acid and methanol were found lower in the phenol containing mixtures compared to the feed consisting of only glucose. One of the possible reasons introduced was the inhibition of Cannizzaro and de-carbonylation reactions due to the stronger acid characteristics of phenol at elevated temperatures. Wahyudiono et al. [28] studied the decomposition of guaiacol that is a model compound situated in the aromatic ring structure of lignin within 483–673K in a batch reactor. It was deduced that the higher molecular weight compounds formed as a result of the cross-linking reactions between the active sites and the phenolic structure decomposed from guaiacol. The main compounds produced from guaiacol in supercritical water were determined as catechol, phenol, and o-cresol. Detection and determination of the main intermediate compounds were essential to understand the biomass conversion pathways during hydrothermal gasification. Hydrolysis reaction of cellulose produces glucose and oligosaccharides as the primary step in the SCWG of a biomass. The aqueous and gaseous products were formed by further decomposition of the saccharides and lignin. Bonn and Bobleter [29] concluded that pyruvaldehyde, 5-(hydroxymethyl) furfural (5-HMF), glycolaldehyde, dihydroxyacetone, furfural, and glyceraldehyde are the main degradation products of glucose and fructose at 513°C. The 5-HMF was produced through the dehydration reaction of d-fructose [30]. The formation of various aqueous compounds are explained by the hydration of furan type compounds to carboxylic acids, alcohols, phenols, aldehydes, and ketones [31]. The carboxylic acids and the furfurals have the highest yields of the aqueous products. The acetic acid, formic acid, and a little amount of hydroxyacetic acid were found mainly in the carboxylic acid group of the aqueous product. The homogenous alkali catalyst enhanced the formic acid yields due to the formation of more resistant formate salts. Akgül et al. [32] investigated the hydrothermal gasification products of Rosa Damascena in the absence and presence of the catalysts K2CO3 and Trona at 500°C and 600°C. The total carboxylic acid yields increased in the presence of the catalysts, but, an adverse effect was observed with Rosa Damascena n-hexane extraction residue. The higher yields of organic acids was explained as the increasing stability of the formate salts to degradation [25]. Variations were observed in the acetic acid and total acid yields in this study. This may be caused because of the unstable behaviour of the formates in the hydrothermal process. The pressure was seen as being more effective on the aqueous product yields than temperature. As pressure increased, the yields decreased generally. The ion product of water decreased with the decreasing pressure and led to a less aqueous product. The 5-MF was the main compound in the furfurals subgroup of the aqueous products with the highest amounts in this study. The total yields of furfurals in the SCWG of PTS increased from 8.3ppm (at 430 bars) to 24.9ppm (at 198 bars) with a decreasing pressure at 500°C and from 6.6ppm (430 bars) to 13.6ppm (200 bars) at 600°C. Similar changes in the yields of furfurals were observed in the SCWG of FTS. Watanabe et al. [30] obtained higher amounts of 5-HMF at higher pressures in the range of 40.0–80.0MPa. The highest yield of 5-HMF was obtained at 600°C and 20.0MPa in the hydrothermal gasification of glucose in a previous work."
9,Conclusion,"Hydrothermal gasification of PTS and FTS was performed at 500°C and 600°C with a pressure range of 20.0–42.5MPa. Studies were carried out in the absence and presence of K2CO3 as a catalyst in a batch reactor for a reaction time of 1h. The amount of the gaseous product was found higher in the gasification of PTS due to lower lignin and the higher extractive content of it. As increasing pressure, CLE and RE slightly increased and CGE slightly decreased. The maximum YH was obtained at 600°C and about 20.0MPa in the presence of a catalyst for both feedstocks. The highest YM was reached at 600°C and 43.0MPa with K2CO3. The alkali effect of the catalyst improved the yields of the gaseous products. The aqueous product includes carboxylic acids and furfurals mainly followed by phenols, aldehydes, and ketones with lower yields. The dominant parameter in the yields of an aqueous product was found as pressure. As the pressure decreased, higher yields of aqueous products were obtained. It can be concluded that hydrothermal gasification of a woody biomasses can be used for the purpose of hydrogen and methane manufacturing to utilize these kinds of wood wastes more environmentally."
