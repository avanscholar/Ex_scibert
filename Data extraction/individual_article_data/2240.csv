0,Introduction,"The depletion of fossil resource and increasing greenhouse gas emission caused by ever growing consumption of fossil oil have driven tremendous efforts to find alternative resource that is renewable [1–4]. Lignocellulosic biomass is renewable and readily available with low cost. It represents the largest potential volume for biofuel and biochemical production [5]. U.S. department of energy has identified 12 platform molecules that could be derived from lignocellulosic biomass and used as precursors for value-added chemicals and fuels [6,7]. Among these platform molecules, γ-valerolactone (GVL) is considered as a versatile building block with wide applications. It is chemically stable with low toxicity, which could be directly used as fuel additive [8], green solvent [9], food additive [10] and intermediate for the production of chemicals [11,12]. GVL is normally produced via direct hydrogenation of levulinic acid (LA). Noble metals have shown high catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of LA to GVL. For instance, Jayaram et al. reported that a molecular sieve supported Ru catalyst could give 99.9% of LA conversion and 99.8% GVL yield at 100 °C under 30 atm H2 pressure [13]. A water-soluble Pt catalyst modified with nitrogen-containing ligands could achieve a quantitative selectivity towards GVL with a high TOF value (3540 h−1) under 50 bar H2 pressure [14]. However, handling of high pressure H2 would bring safety concerns for industrial operation. Hence, catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) reaction with abundant alcohols as in situ H-donor has attracted more attention in many biomass conversion process to produce high value-added chemicals [15,16]. For example, furfural could be converted to 2-methylfuran with a bifunctional Ru/RuOx/C catalyst via CTH at 140 °C under 2.04 MPa N2 pressure [17]. Thomas et al. used a Cu-doped porous metal oxide catalyst for the hydrogenation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) via CTH reaction and achieved 48% DMF yield with 100% HMF conversion at 260 °C [18]. Yasutaka Kuwahara et al. used sulfonic acid-functionalized UiO-66 as the catalyst for the hydrogenation of LA and its eaters to GVL via CTH reaction with 85% yield of GVL at 140 °C [19]. Despite the advantages of using low cost and safe alcohols, current CTH reaction still suffered from harsh reaction conditions and relatively low product yield. Therefore, further improvement of the CTH conversion to enhance product yield and reaction efficiency is still highly desired. Graphitized carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a type of metal-free semiconductor and has wide application in photocatalysis [20], electrocatalysis [21] and other related fields [22,23], owing to its unique properties such as low toxicity, easy fabrication process from cheap raw materials, high electron-transfer ability, and high stability [24,25]. Furthermore, it has a graphite-like layered structure which enable it as an excellent support for noble metals affording unique catalytic behaviors. For instance, palladium (Pd) was supported on g-C3N4 for use as the catalyst in alkene hydrogenation with ammonia borane as the hydrogen source [26]. Xu et al. synthesized Pd/g-C3N4 as the catalyst to prepare amine via transfer hydrogenation [27]. They indicated that Pd/g-C3N4 catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic performance in the amine syntheses at room temperature. The g-C3N4/CoPz composite was prepared for the oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid and glucaric acid using H2O2 as the oxidant and obtained 52.1% of glucose conversion and 79.4% of the total selectively [28]. In this study, graphitized nitrogen carbide (g-C3N4) was prepared from two different precursors and used as the catalyst support to load ruthenium for the catalytic transfer hydrogenation reaction of LA to GVL. To the best our knowledge, this is the first study that applied Ru/g-C3N4 catalysts to reduction of LA to GVL via CTH reaction. The resulting Ru/g-C3N4 catalysts were characterized and the structure-activity relationship was studied. Furthermore, the influences of reaction conditions on the CTH reaction as well as the recyclability of the Ru/g-C3N4 catalyst were investigated. Finally, the reaction pathway of LA to GVL via CTH reaction over Ru/g-C3N4 catalyst was proposed."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Urea, melamine, 2-propanol (2-PrOH), 2-butanol (2-BuOH) and 3-pentanol were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Company (Shanghai, China). Levulinic acid was acquired from Adamas Reagent Company (Shanghai, China). Ethyl levulinate (EL), γ-valerolactone (GVL) and angelica lactone (AL) were purchased from Energy Chemical Reagent Company (Shanghai, China). Methyl levulinate (ML) and butyl levulinate (BL) were purchased from TCI (Shanghai, China). RuCl3·3H2O (Ru, 37%) was bought from KaiDa Chemical company (Shannxi, China). And the 5 wt % Ru/C catalyst was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Company. All chemicals were used without further purification."
3,Preparation of g-C3N4 and Ru/g-C3N4 catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of g-C3N4 and Ru/g-C3N4 catalysts The preparation method of g-C3N4 was adapted from literature [29,30]. In brief, a semi-closed alumina crucible with 20 g urea or 5 g melamine was put in a muffle furnace without any atmosphere protection. The heating process included three stages. Firstly, it was heated to 230 °C at 20 °C/min. Then the heating rate was lowered to 10 °C/min and the heating process continued to reach 300 °C. Finally, the heating rate was further lowered to 5 °C/min until the temperature reached 550 °C and then kept at 550 °C for another 4 h. Upon the end of heating process, the crucible was cooled down to room temperature, the solid sample of g-C3N4 was ground to powder and collected. The obtained g-C3N4 from two different precursors, urea and melamine, were named as UCN and MCN, respectively. The typical process of preparing Ru/g-C3N4 catalysts is as follows, UCN or MCN (0.9 g) were mixed with RuCl3 3H2O (0.2054 g) in 100 mL deionized water and stirred for 2 h NaBH4 (0.1 g) was then added to the mixture and continued stirring for another 2 h. The solid product was then washed repeatedly with deionized water and ethanol for 3 times. Finally, the solid was collected by filtration and dried at 60 °C overnight under vacuum. The obtained dried product was ground to powder and labeled as Ru/UCN and Ru/MCN, corresponding to the urea and melamine precursors, respectively."
4,Catalyst characterizations,"2.3 Catalyst characterizations The crystalline structures of the catalysts were analyzed on an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, DMAX III VC, Rigaku, Japan) equipped with a Cu Kα as the X-ray source (λ = 0.1541 nm). The 2θ range was from 10° to 80° with a step speed of 5°/min and the accelerating voltage and current were 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. The real Ru content of the catalysts was determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) on an Agilent 720 E S instrument (Agilent, USA). To prepare the test sample, solid Ru/g-C3N4 sample (around 15 mg) was first dissolved in HNO3/HClO4 aqueous solution (10 mL), and the solution was then transferred to a 10 mL volumetric flask and diluted with deionized water. The real contents of Ru in Ru/UCN and Ru/MCN catalysts are 2.82 wt % and 3.02 wt %, respectively, which were determined by ICP-OES. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the catalysts were recorded on a Bruker, VERTEX 80 V infrared spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) in the range from 4000 to 400 cm−1 at a resolution of 2 cm−1 under room temperature. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was conducted on a JSM-7600 F electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) for the morphology of the catalysts. Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis was also applied in connection with the SEM for the elemental analysis of the catalysts. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) were conducted on a JEOL-2100 (JEOL, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The samples were first dispersed in ethanol and then deposited on a Cu grid coated with carbon film. The surface area and porosity of the catalysts were analyzed by N2 sorption (Tristar II 3020 M, Micromeritics) at 77 K using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. All the samples were degassed at 393 K for 12 h before analysis. CO2- and NH3-temperature programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were performed in a Micromeritics Auto Chem II 2920 device. For each run, the sample was first heated to 573 K at a rate of 10 K min−1 with He flow for 0.5 h to remove adsorbed impurities. Then it was cooled to 373 K to adsorb CO2 or NH3 followed by He washing for another 1 h to remove physically adsorbed CO2 or NH3. TPD data from 373 K to 1023 K was collected with a slope of 20 K min−1. The surface chemical state of the catalysts were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) on an AXIS UltraDLD X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (SHIMADZU, Japan) using Al Kα X-ray as the excitation source (hv = 1486.6 eV)."
5,Catalytic transfer hydrogenation reactions over the Ru/g-C3N4 catalysts,"2.4 Catalytic transfer hydrogenation reactions over the Ru/g-C3N4 catalysts Catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) reactions of levulinic acid and levulinic esters were conducted in thick-wall pressure tubes. For a model reaction with Ru/UCN catalyst, firstly LA (1.0 mmol), Ru/UCN (40 mg), and 2-ProH (5 mL) were charged into the reaction tube and mixed well with a magnetic stirrer. Before subject to reaction, air inside the tube was removed by purging with N2. The reaction was allowed to react for 12 h at 100 °C with an agitation speed of 500 rpm. Upon the end of the hydrogenation reaction, the tube was cooled down to room temperature, and the reaction mixture was sampled and subjected to analysis. To recycle the catalyst, it was recovered by centrifugation after reaction and washed with 2-PrOH for 3 times and directly used for next run. The reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS, Agilent 7890 A, Agilent 5975C MSD) and gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 7890 A) with a DB-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, Agilent). The temperature of column increased from 160 to 250 °C at a 15 °C/min rate. Naphthalene was used as the internal standard."

7,Characterization of the g-C3N4 support and Ru/g-C3N4 catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of the g-C3N4 support and Ru/g-C3N4 catalysts The XRD spectra of Ru/g-C3N4 catalysts and g-C3N4 supports were shown in Fig. 1 . The characteristic peaks of g-C3N4 at 13.0° and 27.4°, corresponding to the (100) and (002) planes, respectively, appear in the spectra of all samples. The former peak represents the in-plane structural packing of tri-s-triazine (heptazine) units and the later represents the interlayer packing of aromatic ring structure [31]. Compared to the XRD patterns of urea and melamine (Fig. S1), no diffraction peaks of urea and melamine was observed in the spectra of g-C3N4 samples, indicated that the precursors were completely converted to g-C3N4 structure after calcination. It is worth noting that the intensities of the g-C3N4 characteristic peaks of the UCN sample are weaker than those of MCN, suggesting a lower crystallinity and/or formation of defects in the structure of UCN [32]. The lower crystallinity of UCN sample should be resulted from the release of N2 and NH3 generated from the degradation of urea during the calcination process. In addition, the loss of N during the calcination process could form defects in the resulting g-C3N4 structure [33]. A weak signal at 43.9° appears in the spectra of Ru/g-C3N4 samples, corresponding to the (101) planes of metal ruthenium (Ru0, 00-006-0663). Similarly, the intensity of this peak is also weak, which could be due to well dispersion or small particle sizes of ruthenium metal on the support [34]. The FT-IR spectra of g-C3N4 and Ru/g-C3N4 samples are visualized in Fig. 2 . Strong IR absorption bands of typical g-C3N4 structure can be seen in the spectra of both samples calcined from urea and melamine, in which the absorption bands at 1405, 1461, 1573 and 1639 cm−1 correspond to the stretching vibration modes of C–N heterocycles. And the peaks at 1238 and 1319 cm−1 are attributed to 2C–N and 3C–N, respectively. Moreover, tri-s-triazine ring, corresponding to the absorption peak at 810 cm−1, can be certified in all samples. The peaks at 3154 cm−1 and 3262 cm−1 are assigned to the stretching vibrational mode of -NHx- and the peak at 3432 cm−1 is attributed to adsorbed water [20]. Noteworthy, as depicted in Fig. 2b, the characteristic peak of tri-s-triazine unit in both spectra of UCN and Ru/UCN display a blue shift compared to those of MCN and Ru/MCN, which may owe to the defects at N sites of the hexagonal ring in the UCN structure. The similarities in the FT-IR spectra of the g-C3N4 supports and the Ru/g-C3N4 catalysts indicate the preservation of the g-C3N4 structure after ruthenium loading. It also suggests a non-covalently coupled interaction between g-C3N4 and metal nanoparticles in the catalysts, as concluded in literature [35]. The TEM images of g-C3N4 and Ru/g-C3N4 catalysts are displayed in Fig. 3 . The TEM image of UCN exhibits an ultrathin nanosheet structure with almost transparent feature (Fig. 3a). Compared to the UCN sample, the TEM image of MCN is darker, suggesting stacked layers in its structure (Fig. 3b). As discussed in previous section, urea would generate gaseous degradation products during the calcination process, which in turn might promote the exfoliation of the carbon layer and resulted in thinner structure [36]. The SEM images of UCN and MCN also suggest the stacked-layer structure of the g-C3N4 samples (Fig. S2). Meanwhile, the SEM image shows that the UCN sample displays curled and ragged edge, which also indicates its thin layer structure that would cause curly edge due to the minimization of surface energy [37]. However, the original smooth surface of g-C3N4 support becomes rough after loading Ru. The TEM images of Ru/UCN and Ru/MCN exhibit similar crumbled sheet like structure as those of the g-C3N4 samples but with dispersed dark spotted areas corresponding to the loaded Ru nanoparticles (Fig. 3c and d). In addition, it can be seen that Ru nanoparticles has better dispersity on the UCN support than MCN. Given the less compact sheet structure of UCN suggested by the TEM images, this result is expected. Besides, the XRD characterization indicated that UCN may possess defects at N sites and thereby may induce surface charges on its structure, which could be beneficial to the dispersion and anchor of Ru particles [38]. The inset images at Fig. 3c and d list the size distributions of Ru nanoparticles on these two g-C3N4 supports, in which it ranged from 0.5 to 3.0 nm on UCN and 1.5–4.5 nm on MCN. The fitting analysis suggests that the average size of Ru nanoparticles on MCN is about 3.12 nm while it is around 1.61 nm on UCN, which should be resulted from the better dispersion of Ru on the UCN support. Moreover, the HRTEM images of Ru/UCN and Ru/MCN (Fig. 3e and f) show that the lattice space of Ru nanoparticle is around 0.206 nm that assigned to the Ru (101) plane of metal Ru (COD ID: 00-006-0663), indicating that high valent Ru+ was reduced to Ru0 during the preparation process. To further explore the specific surface area and porous structure of the g-C3N4 support and Ru/g-C3N4 catalysts, N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were performed. The resulting isotherm and pore size distribution curves of the g-C3N4 support and Ru/g-C3N4 were shown in Fig. 4 . All samples exhibit standard type Ⅳ isotherm with H3 hysteresis loop (Fig. 4a), implying mesoporous structure of the g-C3N4 supports and Ru/g-C3N4 catalysts [39]. Table 1 summarizes the textual property of the above four samples. The S BET are found to be 85, 38, 58, 22 m2/g corresponding to UCN, MCN, Ru/UCN, Ru/MCN samples, respectively. The UCN sample exhibited significantly higher BET surface area than MCN, which may be due to the looser structure of UCN that composed of small and scattered nanosheets as confirmed by the SEM and TEM results (Fig. S2 and Fig. 3). Generally, the higher surface area can provide more sites for metal anchoring to increase metal dispersity, thereby increasing the catalytic activity of the catalyst [40]. Furthermore, the decreasing surface area of Ru/g-C3N4 compared to its corresponding g-C3N4 supports suggested the successfully anchoring of ruthenium metal. The pore diameter distribution curves also confirm that both the g-C3N4 and the Ru/g-C3N4 catalysts possess mesoporous structures (Fig. 4b), which would be beneficial for the mass transfer during later reaction [41]. It is believed that both acid and base sites on the surface of a catalyst could serve as active sites and considerably affect the catalytic performance of the catalyst [40,41]. Therefore, CO2 and NH3-TPD analysis were conducted to investigate the acidic and basic properties of the Ru/g-C3N4 catalysts and the results verify the coexistence of acidic and basic sites on the surface of both Ru/UCN and Ru/MCN catalysts (Fig. 5 ). It can be seen from the CO2-TPD curve that both Ru/UCN and Ru/MCN catalysts exhibited three peaks in the ranges of 100–300, 350 to 500, and 500–600 °C, corresponding to the weak, moderate and strong basic sites, respectively. The origin of the basic sites could be the pyridine nitrogen on the g-C3N4 structure or the N-containing groups (e.g., –NH2) and hydroxyl group on the surface of the catalyst [27,42]. The NH3-TPD curve (Fig. 5b) shows that both two catalysts exhibit moderate acidity (200–350 °C), which may be resulted from the presence of Rux+ in the catalysts. XPS spectroscopy was employed to determine the electronic state of the elements on the g-C3N4 support and Ru/g-C3N4 catalysts. The survey spectra (Fig. 6 a) shows the presence of Ru species on the Ru/g-C3N4 samples, indicating the successfully loading of Ru on the g-C3N4 support. The high-resolution C 1s spectra of g-C3N4 (Fig. 6b) exhibit two characteristic peaks around 284.8 eV and 288.0 eV, which should be assigned to C–C and NC–N, respectively. Peak at 286.2 eV corresponds to the C–NH2 species on the g-C3N4 support [43]. Moreover, the binding energy at 288.0 eV assigned to NC–N on UCN is slightly lower than that of MCN (288.12 eV). As discussed in previous sections that the UCN sample might present some N defects caused by the release of N2 and NH3 during urea degradation. These N defects could in turn synergistically increase the electron density of C atom and lowered its binding energy [30]. The high resolution N 1s spectra of g-C3N4 (Fig. 6c) can be deconvoluted into three peaks at 398.5 eV, 399.6 eV, and 401.1 eV, which are belonged to the sp2 nitrogen in the tri-s-triazine units (C–NC), sp3 hybridized nitrogen (N-(C)3), and the nitrogen atom bonded with hydrogen atoms (C–N–H), respectively [44]. Similarly to that of C 1s orbital, the binding energy of the N 1s orbital of UCN shifted to the lower field (about 0.28 eV) compared to that of MCN and may also be resulted from the N defects on the UCN [30]. Fig. 6d displays both the C 1s and Ru 3 d of the Ru/g-C3N4 samples due to the highly overlap of these peaks. Nevertheless, peaks at 277.9 eV and 281.5 eV corresponded to the metallic Ru could be deconvoluted, suggesting the presence of Ru0 phase on the Ru/g-C3N4. To further clarify the chemical states of Ru, Ru 3p spectra was deconvoluted and displayed in Fig. 6e. The main peak of the spectrum was deconvoluted into two doublets of Ru 3p3/2 and Ru 3p1/2. The two peaks at 459.2 eV, 481.1 eV were indexed to the metallic ruthenium, indicating that most Ru3+ from RuCl3 was effectively reduced to Ru0 during wet reduction treatment. The two peaks at 461.9 eV and 484.6 eV assigned to Rux + species should be come from residue RuCl3 [45]. Notably, the binding energy of Ru0 3p of Ru/UCN shifted to lower field (about 0.3 eV) compared to that of Ru/MCN. As demonstrated in the N 1s spectrum of the g-C3N4 support, N existed at different chemical states on UCN and MCN, which may further affected their interactions with the loading metal Ru and resulted in different binding energies [46]. In addition, the lower binding energy of Ru0 3p of Ru/UCN indicates that UCN denoted electrons to Ru and form more electron-rich Ru0 species on Ru/UCN [45]. The N 1s spectra of the Ru/g-C3N4 were deconvoluted into three individual peaks around 395.8 eV, 397.1 eV, and 398.4 eV, which are assigned to C–NC, N-(C)3/H–N-(C)2, and C–N–H, respectively (Fig. 6f). It can be seen that the binding energy of N-(C)3/H–N-(C)2 in the Ru/UCN is higher than Ru/MCN, indicating a stronger interaction between Ru and UCN than that with MCN support."
8,Catalytic transfer hydrogenation of LA to GVL,"3.2 Catalytic transfer hydrogenation of LA to GVL The CTH conversion of LA to GVL using the above prepared g-C3N4 and Ru/g-C3N4 as catalysts was conducted in 2-PrOH both as the hydrogen donor and solvent. The results are listed in Table 2 . No GVL was detected and the LA conversion was low when pristine UCN and MCN were used (entries 1 and 2). Under the same reaction conditions, loading of metal Ru on the g-C3N4 drastically enhanced the catalytic activity of the catalysts. The Ru/UCN catalyst achieved 100% LA conversion and almost theoretical GVL yield of 99.8% (entry 3) while Ru/MCN gave 67.6% LA conversion and 88.7% GVL yield (entry 4). The better catalytic performance of Ru/UCN should be resulted from the smaller Ru nanoparticle size, higher specific surface area than those of Ru/MCN, as confirmed by TEM and BET results [1,47]. In addition, the XPS results suggest that Ru/UCN contains more electron-rich Ru0 species, which would facilitate LA hydrogenation by decreasing the activation energy of breaking R–COOH to R–CO and –OH [45]. Commercial Ru/C catalyst only gave 58.7% of GVL yield and 73.4% of LA conversion (entry 5), suggested that g-C3N4 possesses better catalytic activity as Ru support than pure carbon. The higher activity of g-C3N4 support should be attributed to 1) the N-rich structure to provide enhanced binding ability for noble metal and 2) the 2D nanosheet structure to disperse and stabilize metal particles [27]. Furthermore, the pyridine nitrogen on g-C3N4 could be functioned as Lewis base, which would promote the cleavage of oxygen-hydrogen bonds [48,49]. Besides, the –NH2 and -OH groups on the surface of g-C3N4 support could promote the absorption of solvent and acid substrate (i.e., LA) by hydrogen bonding and facilitate the migration of active hydrogen ([H]) to unsaturation bonds over the metal sites and attacked the substrate LA [50]. It is known that the conversion of LA to GVL generates H2O via esterification process. Therefore, 5 wt % of water was introduced to the reaction system to explore whether the Ru/g-C3N4 catalysts can tolerant water. Still a relatively high GVL yield of 98% was obtained (entry 6), suggested that Ru/UCN maintained high catalytic activity in the presence of water. Generally, the reaction temperature has a profound effect on the reaction rate. Therefore, the effect of reaction temperature on the LA conversion and GVL yield were investigated at a range from 90 to 140 °C (Fig. 7 a). When the reaction proceeded at 90 °C, only 4% LA conversion and 0.7% GVL yield was achieved. With the increase of reaction temperature, the LA conversion and GVL yield continuously increased until a maximum GVL yield of 99.9% and full LA conversion was obtained at 120 °C. The LA conversion and yield of GVL remained almost unchanged when the temperature further increased to 140 °C. Higher reaction temperature could promote the dissociation of [H] from the H-donor solvent and further enhance the reaction efficiency of CTH conversion. Meanwhile, the influence of reaction time was investigated and the result is shown in Fig. 7b. Both the GVL yield and LA conversion increased apparently with the extension of reaction time, and the maximum GVL yield and LA conversion were obtained at 12 h. The yield of GVL decreased slightly with further prolonging reaction time, which might due to some side reactions. Catalyst dosage is one of the most important parameters to evaluate the activity of a catalyst. Different amounts of Ru/UCN catalyst were employed in the CTH reaction of LA. As shown in Fig. 7c, only 37.4% LA conversion and 29.3% yield of GVL were obtained when the catalyst dosage was 10 mg. As the catalyst dosages increased from 10 to 40 mg, both LA conversion and GVL yield increased. The reaction showed highest GVL yields of 99.8% at 40 mg of catalyst dosages. Further increasing the Ru/UCN dosage to 50 mg showed limited improvement on the LA conversion and GVL yield. With the optimized reaction conditions, different H-donor solvents were investigated and the results are shown in Table 3 . It can be seen that primary alcohols including methanol and ethanol gave poor performance as H-donor on the LA conversion and GVL yield (entries 1 and 2). This result is consistent with previously reported work and is believed to be ascribed to the more difficult β-hydride elimination when primary alcohol formed alkoxy species on the surface of the catalyst than that of secondary alcohol [12,51]. For the secondary alcohols, the reaction with 2-PrOH afforded 99.8% yield of GVL (entry 3) at 100 °C while almost no CTH reaction occurred in 2-BuOH and 3-pentanol mediums (entries 4 and 5). Only when the reaction temperature increased to 120 °C for 2-BuOH and 140 °C for 3-pentanol, desired GVL yields of 99.7% and 99.6%, respectively, were achieved (entries 6 and 7). The higher reaction temperatures required for 2-BuOH and 3-pentanol should be due to their higher reduction potential than 2-PrOH [40]. To further explore the catalytic activity of Ru/UCN on other substrate, three levulinate esters (i.e., ML, EL, BL) were chosen for the CTH reaction over Ru/UCN catalyst. As shown in Table 3, levulinate esters gave lower GVL yield (entries 8 to 10), than LA possibly owing to the steric hindrance of the alkyl groups [19,52]. Nevertheless, Ru/UCN catalyst still exhibited high catalytic activity for the CTH conversion of levulinate esters to GVL with secondary alcohol as the H-donor solvent."
9,Possible mechanism of CTH conversion of LA to GVL over Ru/g-C3N4 catalyst,"3.3 Possible mechanism of CTH conversion of LA to GVL over Ru/g-C3N4 catalyst Based on above results, the reaction mechanism of CTH conversion over Ru/UCN catalyst is speculated. Generally, hydrogenation of LA to GVL follows two different pathways via hydrogenation and dehydration as shown in Scheme 1 . In route 1, H-donor (alcohol) was first absorbed on the surface of the catalyst and formed alkoxide species by dissociation of O–H bond. The alkoxide species subsequently undergo β-hydride elimination to form metal hydride species and release the side product (e.g., acetone if using 2-PrOH) [12]. The unsaturated CO bond of LA was then hydrogenated by the active metal hydride species to yield 4-hydroxypentanoate acid (4-HPA), which finally underwent intramolecular cyclization and formed GVL. Route 2 follows the formation of angelica lactones (AL) by endothermic dehydration and subsequent hydrogenation to form GVL [13]. In this study, Ru/UCN showed almost no catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of AL, the intermediate species of route 2, to GVL (entry 11, Table 3), which indicated that route 2 is not feasible for the CTH conversion of LA to GVL over Ru/UCN. Furthermore, it is reported that AL-mediated pathway requires high acidity and elevated reaction temperature in comparison of 4-HPA mediated GVL synthesis [53]. Therefore, the CTH conversion of LA to GVL over Ru/UCN catalyst should follow the 4-HPA mediated reaction pathway, namely first hydrogenation and then dehydration (Route 1)."
10,Stability of Ru/UCN catalyst,"The stability of Ru/UCN catalyst was evaluated by performing consecutive runs with recycled catalyst. Namely, the Ru/UCN catalyst was separated by centrifugation after each CTH reaction, washed with fresh 2-PrOH for three times, and then directly subjected to next run. As can be seen from Fig. 8 , the LA conversion decreased slightly while GVL yield almost remained unchanged as the reaction cycle increased. It is interesting to note that the catalytic activity of Ru/UCN was restored in the fourth and fifth run. The recycle experiments were also conducted with prolonged reaction time (12 h) to yield full LA conversion, which gave similar result of restored catalytic activity after the third reaction cycle (Fig. S3). To further explore this interesting result, recycled Ru/UCN catalyst after the fifth run with full LA conversion was characterized with XRD, TEM, and XPS, and the results were compared with fresh prepared catalyst. The XRD pattern of the recovered catalyst displayed similar diffraction peaks as the fresh prepared catalyst (Fig. 9 a), indicated the active metal sites on the catalyst possessed outstanding stability during the CTH reaction. Fig. 9c shows the TEM image and particle size distribution of recovered Ru/UCN catalyst. No obvious changes in the surface morphology of recovered Ru/UCN catalyst is observed from the TEM image, in which the Ru nanoparticles remained well dispersion on the UCN after CTH reaction. However, the average size of the Ru nanoparticles increased slightly from 1.61 nm of fresh prepared catalyst to 2.43 nm of recovered catalyst (Fig. 9d). It has been reported that metal site of most supported metallic catalysts would inevitably undergo aggregation phenomenon in thermal solutions and therefore resulted in increased particle size [12]. The recovered Ru/UCN was further investigated by XPS characterization. Similar to that of fresh prepared catalyst, the main peaks on the Ru 3p spectrum of recovered Ru/UCN catalyst can be deconvoluted into two doublets of Ru 3p3/2 and Ru 3p1/2 (Fig. 9b). The binding energies at 461.6 eV and 484.5 eV corresponded to ruthenium oxide species while the binding energies at 459.2 eV, 481.3 eV are assigned to metallic ruthenium. Moreover, the peak area ratio of Ru0/Rux+ is around 2.4 for the recovered Ru/UCN catalyst, which is higher than that of the fresh prepared Ru/UCN catalyst (≈1.7). This result suggests that more Rux + species were further reduced to Ru0 during the hydrogenation reaction. And the reduced Ru metal could provide more active sites for the CTH conversion. Therefore, exposing of more Ru0 species on the recovered Ru/UCN catalyst after several runs of the LA CTH conversion is responsible for the restored catalytic activity of recovered Ru/UCN catalyst."
11,Conclusions,"In this study, g-C3N4 was prepared from two different precursors (urea and melamine) and used as the support for Ru metal loading. The characterization of resulting g-C3N4 supports and Ru/g-C3N4 catalysts showed that UCN exhibited thinner and less compact layer structure than MCN. TEM showed that Ru nanoparticles exhibited smaller size and better dispersion on UCN than MCN. In addition, the XPS result indicated that more electron rich Ru0 species existed on the Ru/UCN catalyst. As a result, Ru/UCN catalyst gave higher catalytic activity toward the CTH conversion of LA to GVL than Ru/MCN with 100% LA conversion and 99.8% yield of GVL. Mechanism study suggests that the CTH reaction of LA to GVL over Ru/UCN catalyst followed the 4-HPA mediated reaction pathway, namely first hydrogenation and then dehydration. The Ru/UCN catalyst also demonstrated high stability in acidic reaction medium and could give 98.6% yield of GVL after 5 reaction cycles."
