0,Introduction,"Converting low-value straight chain paraffin, chiefly C6-C8, into commercially important aromatics, sources and constituents of petrochemicals and high-octane gasoline, respectively is a well-established process in any typical refinery. Further, many efforts have been put to aromatize still lower carbon number paraffins, starting from C1 to C5. In the latter case, metal-containing zeolites, with Ga and Zn in prominence, and a metal either in or extra-framework teem the literature. Further, researchers have seized opportunities to aromatize C2-C4 alcohols after the advent of methanol to aromatics/gasoline process. Thus, value addition to cheap, straight chain paraffins and alcohols by their individual aromatization has been well reported. Here we do not intend to provide a review on literature on alkane and alcohol aromatization. Readers are referred to references for detailed discussion on them (Paul and Naccache, 1997; Caeiro et al., 2006; Junming and Wang, 2014; Galadima and Oki, 2015; Tretyakov et al., 2010). Though C2 and C3 olefins can be aromatized, due to their increasing demand towards polymer manufacturing, routes for converting heavier naphtha to valuable products are being explored (Mochizuki et al., 2012). In addition to availability of cheap, straight chain paraffins, stricter gasoline composition regulations demanding typically less than 1 vol% of benzene, provide an impetus to aromatize alkanes in presence of alcohols to minimise benzene formation by its alkylation. In fact, Methaforming® is a process of New Gas Technologies - Synthesis proposed to meet the gasoline specifications with regard to its benzene content (Sims et al., 2019). Chief argument of this process is understood that methanol (or for that matter, any other alcohol or low carbon number olefins) would methylate (or alkylate) aromatics, including benzene, formed due to alkane aromatization. In that case, alcohol dehydration is exothermic and alkane cyclization is endothermic and the simultaneity is desirable from a heat management point of view (Su et al., 2016). Ultimate effect would be reduced benzene concentration in products at one third of the costs of conventional paths followed. Techno-economic analysis of Methaforming® has been discussed in reference by Sims et al. (2019). Catalyst, namely, Pt/Al2O3 has shown great potential in aromatization of heavy naphtha but is unable to convert the lower paraffins into aromatics. Bimetallic combinations of Pt, Re, Ir, Ge present the same difficulty. These catalysts exhibit lower selectivity for aromatics production from lower paraffins (Azzam et al., 2010). Aromatization of inexpensive lower paraffins would be a good proposal for production of valuable aromatics which have wide range of applications. ZSM-5 has proved its importance in straight chain paraffins aromatization because of its high acidity, and pore geometry. Zeolites impregnated with Ga, Zn, Pt, etc. are widely reported for aromatization reactions. Mainly, natural gas condensate (NGC) and light naphtha (LN) contain pentanes and hexanes which are difficult to convert to aromatics in conventional reforming process. Value addition to these alkanes is possible by converting them to aromatics using HZSM-5. Nevertheless, ZSM-5 is not without limitations. Thermodynamically, aromatization reaction becomes difficult with reduction in alkane size (Hodala et al., 2016) with olefins becoming favored products over aromatics. Alkane aromatization is limited by olefin formation due to carbonium ion scission into carbenium ions and hydrogen/olefins. Aromatic formation occurs due to hydride transfer from naphthene to smaller alkenes as a last step in the reaction. Here, lower paraffins form in large quantities which suppress the aromatics yield. Solution to this problem is achieved by introducing a dehydrogenating metal on to ZSM-5. Metal controls the production of lower paraffins during cracking and hydrogen transfer reactions. Electronic properties of metals thus play a key role in metal-zeolite catalysed aromatization reactions. Zn on HZSM-5 has been reported to be responsible for the hexene formation from n-hexane. ZnO and HZSM-5 both are involved in the n-hexane activation. Zn hinders olefin oligomerization thereby reducing the formation of higher aromatics (C9+ aromatics) (Viswanadham et al., 2004). Zn in cationic locations gives rise to formation of new and strong Lewis acid sites responsible for steps, oligomerization of cracked products and dehydrogenation of cyclic intermediates, involved in final aromatizationreaction (Ojasová et al., 1999; Rojasova et al., 1999). Chief concern reported for Zn-ZSM-5 is that the metallic zinc formed during reduction is lost from HZSM-5 at high temperatures. Addition of transition metals with zinc circumvents this problem (Martinez et al., 2017). Further Li et al. (2019) have recently established the formation of COx (CO and CO2) during methanol to aromatics reactions over Zn and ZnO species present on HZSM-5 unlike ZnOH+ Lewis acid sites favouring aromatic formation. Thus metallic Zn reduces carbon atom economy towards liquid products benefitting formation of gaseous products. Mechanistically, formation of hexene is mandatory, cyclization of which is an intermediate step before dehydrogenation which ultimately produces an aromatic. This dehydrogenation step is reported to be rate determining step (RDS). However, cyclization of hexa-1,3,5-triene to cyclohexadiene also has been suggested to be a RDS. It has been shown that rate of cracking of hexene to lower olefins is higher than that of hexane to olefins plus paraffins as main products. ZnO on HZSM-5 oligomerizes olefins and then dehydrogenation the products into aromatics. Thus, n-hexane converts to aromatics via its dehydrogenation to hexene (Kanai and Kawata, 1988). Ga modified ZSM-5 shows better performance particularly in lower alkane aromatization reactions. Gallium sites of Ga-H-ZSM-5 increase rate of alkane dehydrogenation by activating the C-H bond. Brønsted acid sites of ZSM-5 cause olefin oligomerization, cyclization and hydride transfer reactions in addition to aromatic dealkylation, transalkylation, and cracking reactions. These lead to coke formation on acid sites necessitating regeneration by oxidation. Frequency of regeneration depends on reaction temperature and feed composition. The non-framework gallium oxide species cause high dehydrogenation activity in this catalyst (Choudhary et al., 2003; Kanai and Kawata, 1989). As such Pt also has been attempted for alkane aromatization considering its superior dehydrogenation activity and indeed Pt/KL zeolite did afford good intended performance (Katsuno et al., 1993), However, Pt is susceptible to sulfuric poisoning which could be alleviated by introduction of Ni (Dan et al., 2018). In case of aromatization of small olefins like ethylene, its oligomerization to larger olefins followed by cyclization and dehydrogenation leads to aromatic formation (Junming and Wang, 2014; Viswanadham et al., 2012; Tretyakov et al., 2010). The last step in this series is catalysed by Zn and Ga (Guisnet et al., 1992; Biscardi and Iglesia, 1996; Choudhary et al., 2002). Similar series of reactions has been suggested for larger (C8) olefin (Eagan et al., 2019). However, in case of octanol aromatization, the proposed series of reaction is: dehydration to 2-octene, cracking to C3 and C5 compounds, further cracking to smaller alkanes and alkenes, dehydrogenation, and aromatization (Iwamoto et al., 2015). Cracking referred to in this case should explain excess formation of toluene over benzene and xylenes observed in present study and discussed later. Chowdhury et al. (2019) had attributed formation of methylated aromatics to cracking of bulky species and isomerization of ethylated aromatics in case of ethanol aromatization reaction. Two more hypotheses explain olefin formation from an alkane. Oxides of Zn and Ga have been reported to activate alkanes by their dissociative adsorption into corresponding olefins and hydrogen (Hodala et al., 2016; Gabrienko, et al., 2010). These works have confirmed the formation of Ga-alkyl species from their 13C MAS NMR studies and thus dissociative adsorption of an alkane takes place. The alkyl complex desorbs as an olefin. Another imputation is that presence of an alcohol along with an alkane facilitates the latter’s dehydrogenation by forming water scavenging oxygen from the former. All in all, when Ga and Zn on the catalyst (Tshabalala and Scurrell, 2015) and an alcohol in reaction mixture are simultaneously available, alkane dehydrogenation can be expected to proceed swiftly. Thus, aromatization of alkanes (e.g., Wang et al., 2016; Song et al., 2016) and C1-C4 alcohols (e.g., Du et al., 2019) has been amply studied. However their simultaneous aromatization has been scantily reported. Present work intends to bring in cheap C molecules (from natural gas, biomass fermentation products, and light naphtha) and converting them into value-added petrochemicals and fuels. Thus, aromatization of C1-C3 three alcohols and n-hexane in their various proportions has been studied. Catalysts comprised of parent ZSM-5, and parent- and and dealuminated-GaZn. Further, in this communication emphasis has been placed on performance of different catalysts rather than extensively characterizing the materials and dealing with mechanistic aspects."
1,Experimental,"Zeolite HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 20) was purchased from Sud Chemie, Baroda, India. It was impregnated with Zn and Ga by incipient wetness impregnation method. Zinc nitrate hexahydrate Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (FINAR), and gallium nitrate hydrate Ga(NO3)3·xH2O (Sigma Aldrich), were used as metal precursors. Calculated quantity of metal precursors was dissolved in deionized water as 15 mL/g of catalyst. Zeolite (parent and dealuminated) was then added to the solution and stirred for 1 h. The suspension was then dried overnight at 100 °C. Dried powder was calcined at 500 °C by heating at a rate of 5 °C/min in flowing air for 6 h. This was followed by reduction with hydrogen for 4 h at 400 °C. Dealumination of zeolite was accomplished by steaming and subsequent acid leaching. Parent HZSM-5 in powder form was loaded in a fixed bed which was subjected to the flow of steam generated at 500 °C from deionized water (20 mL/h) along with nitrogen flow (50 mL/min) for 4 h duration. Steamed sample was suspended in 2 M HNO3 (Sigma Aldrich) aqueous solution in the proportion of 15 mL/g of zeolite and stirred for 1 h at ambient temperature. The suspension was washed with deionized water to neutral pH. This powder was then dried overnight at 110 °C. Catalytic reactions were carried out in a fixed bed high-pressure continuous down flow reactor (10 mm internal diameter and 300 mm length) of stainless steel (SS316) at 3 MPa pressure. Catalyst (1 g) was packed at mid-length and the reactants were fed by Series I HPLC pump (SSI) at a flow rate of 6 mL/h. Nitrogen was used as a carrier gas maintaining N2 to hydrocarbon molar ratio of 2. Reaction temperature, 500 °C was reached with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. Temperature sensed by a thermocouple housed in a thermo-well touching the top of catalyst bed was recorded as reaction temperature. Reaction products were condensed to 4 °C and were analysed using Shimadzu 2014 gas chromatograph with an FID and ZebronZB-Waxplus (10 m × 0.53 mm × 1.00 μm) column. Apart from unconverted reactants, n-hexane and alcohols, only aromatics were detected in liquid products. At least one third of the runs were repeated to ascertain reproducibility of the results. Formation of incondensable gases in LPG range to the tune of 66% of feed mass for ZSM-5 with Si/Al ratio of 23 (comparable to 20 in present study) during aromatization reactions has been reported (Hodala, et al., 2016) and well known. Additionally, C-atoms in feeds can be lost as CO and CO2. Further, ethanol dehydration is faster than ethylene oligomerization (Eagan, et al., 2019). Assuming this to be true for other alcohols used in this work also, initially formed olefins might have been lost as in condensable gases leading to reduced liquid yields. About 50 mass % of the feed was obtained as liquid product with parent HZSM-5. This proportion increased to about 70 mass % in case of dealuminated HZSM-5. Initial experiments showed higher operating pressure affording liquid yields than those at atmospheric pressure maintaining other conditions same. In fact, Eagan, et al., 2019) reported that under high pressures, equilibrium product distribution to be shifting towards heavy olefins. This can be expected to provide more reactants for intended aromatic formation. Also with nitrogen as a carrier gas, higher liquid yields were obtained than those when hydrogen was used as a carrier gas. Similar behaviour was observed previously (Viswanadham et al., 2004; Hyung-Su, et al., 2014). This is understandable from the fact hydrogen would saturated the intermediate olefins formed during the reaction forming incondensable alkane gases (Viswanadham et al., 2004; Tshabalala and Scurrell, 2015). In view of these, reactions were performed at 3 MPa in flowing nitrogen. Soft coke deposited on catalyst dealuminated GaZnZSM-5 after 28 h time-on-stream, soluble in common solvents, e.g., CH2Cl2 was analysed for identification and quantification of its constituents. For this, the spent catalyst, was dissolved in HF solution and from this solution coke was extracted in CH2Cl2. This extract when analysed by GC–MS."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Aromatization on parent ZSM-5,"3.1 Aromatization on parent ZSM-5 At the beginning, we wish to clarify two aspects: (1) In line with reported literature (e.g., Viswanadham et al., 2004; Tshabalala and Scurrell, 2015; Qingyin et al., 2018) we too have observed formation of gases like methane, ethane, and propane in high extent during aromatization reactions, particularly with parent zeolite samples. Due to our limitation to analyse gaseous products, we report here only liquid product compositions. As has been mentioned earlier liquid product contained only aromatics in addition to unconverted reactants, if any. (2) Publications (e.g., Qingyin et al., 2018, Hyung-Su et al., 2014; Jack et al., 2018) mention yields of aromatic products based on liquid volume/mass. However, this representation does not reflect the extent of feed carbon atoms coming into products. We report C-atom yields, i.e., fraction of C-atoms in feed reflected as individual aromatic compound. Due to this approach, direct comparison of catalyst performance with majority of reported works has become difficult. By quantitative measurements of aromatics, carbon yield and carbon fraction of species i are calculated as follows (Hyung-Su et al., 2014): C a r b o n y i e l d o f s p e c i e s i Y i = m o l o f p r o d u c t s p e c i e s i ∗ n u m b e r o f C a t o m s i n s p e c i e s i m o l ∗ n u m b e r o f C a t o m o f f e e d ∗ 100 % On parent ZSM-5 comparable aromatic yields (20–22%) were obtained for pure methanol and pure ethanol feed (Table 1 , columns 1 and 2). 2-Propanol afforded highest aromatic yield, 31% either alone or from its equi-volume mixture with n-hexane (columns 2 and 7). In this feed mixture, 53.25% C atoms come from n-hexane and balance from propanol. When pure n-hexane is fed, only 11% C-yield was observed, column 4. Thus, in presence of propanol, efficient utilization of C from n-hexane could be realised. In case of methanol and ethanol, though larger proportion of C-atoms comes from n-hexane, total C-yields are relatively poorer, 27 and 16%, respectively. In conclusion, propanol can be deduced to aromatise faster and facilitates n-hexane aromatization. Propanol providing higher aromatic yields than those by methanol or ethanol maybe rationalised based on carbon chain length of alcohols. Ease of alcohol dehydration and stability of carbocations increase with carbon chain length (Gujar et al., 2009). Further, mesopores generated upon dealumnation accelerate dehydration activity (Prestianni et al., 2013) leading to higher aromatic yield as compared to that with parent ZSM-5. Surprisingly, when either methanol or ethanol is present along with propanol and hexane mixture, C-yields of aromatics drastically drop to 8 and 22%, respectively (columns 9 and 8). Thus, reaction intermediates forming from methanol and ethanol might be hindering access of active sites to those from propanol. A mixture of methanol and ethanol with n-hexane gives similar C-yields, 20% to that from individual alcohol, implying their poor capacity to bring in alkane for aromatization, column 10. A mixture of all the three alcohols does not help enhance n-hexane aromatization, column 11. Intermediate alkenes and aromatics occurring from methanol and ethanol coexisting in pores of parent ZSM-5 might be leading to accelerated coking attributable to polycyclic aromatics (Weili et al., 2018). Further, small hydrocarbons oligomerize easily leading to coke deposition (Prestianni et al., 2013). In case of all feeds, toluene remained the major aromatic product as also has been reported earlier (Hodala et al., 2016). This observation indicates the role of cracking reactions responsible for formation of methyl group. This argument can be further supported by the fact that even only n-hexane too resulted in higher proportion of toluene than that of benzene. And this was the case for all the feed combinations. Besides, feed containing only propanol or propanol plus n-hexane gave very little C9 (intuitively, cumene) validating the prominence of cracking reactions. Relatively higher benzene selectivity with propanol alone or along with n-hexane may be due to higher concentration of C6 olefins resulting from propylene dimerization. This observation may suggest that first benzene ring formation is not from n-hexane dehydrogenation followed by cyclization and subsequent dehydrogenation but oligomerization of olefins formed by its (n-hexane’s) cracking. As mentioned in Introduction Section, hexene must be forming due to either metal present on catalyst or an alcohol extracting hydrogen from n-hexane. Hexene thus formed might be cracking leading to subsequent product formation. Also, as expected, the catalyst without any modifications yielded thermodynamic distribution of C8 aromatics. Methanol and propanol gave highest and comparable xylene yields, about 9% and n-hexane the least, about 4%. From xylene yields, it can be deduced that an alcohol fosters xylene formation from hexane but hexane suppresses xylene formation from an alcohol. However, we could not find an explanation for poor xylene yield (3.5%) when n-hexane plus methanol plus propanol (and plus ethanol) was the feed. With methanol high yields of C9 and higher aromatics were obtained. This may be due to highly active methyl species present available for aromatic alkylation reactions."
4,Effects of metal impregnation,"3.2 Effects of metal impregnation Table 3 confirms the intended loading of Zn and Ga on ZSM-5 as inferred from inductively-coupled plasma – optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Now, effectiveness of Zn and Ga for cyclization or aromatization has been well established. In this context, performance of Zn and Ga impregnated ZSM-5 in aromatization of three alcohols was studied first. Specifically, hydrogen treatment of ZSM-5 impregnated with Zn, has been reported to enhance activity in n-pentane aromatization (Sikarin et al., 2016). This was ascribed to formation of (ZnH)+ and H2 chemisorbed species, but with continuous presence of H2. In case of Ga, mono-valent Ga+ on HZSM-5, hexane dehydrogenation was shown to be a rate determining step (RDS) with high (76.6 kcal/mol) activation energy whereas with GaH2 second hydrogen abstraction was the RDS with reduced activation energy (11.1 kcal/mol.) Based on this, it was advanced that aromatization reaction occurs over GaH2/HZSM-5 (Anawat et al., 2019). Now, as mentioned in Experimental Section, our catalysts were reduced in hydrogen after impregnation and calcinations. Thus, constant presence of H2 could have been ensured by dehydrogenation reactions. Hydrogenated metal species can form even from ethane and propane (Anawat et al., 2019) produced during reaction. These combined beneficial effects should have been the reason for high aromatic yields observed here. Table 4 expounds catalytic performance of Zn and Ga impregnated parent- and dealuminated-ZSM-5 zeolites. For comparision purpose, parent ZSM-5 also has been included here. From methanol ZnGa-ZSM-5 showed only 3.5% C-yield at 5 h time-on-stream which was 22% on parent ZSM-5. It is likely that presence of metals produced olefins at higher rates which subsequently oligomerized to form coke on active sites. Hence coking may be responsible for fast deactivation of the catalyst. Further, olefins with small carbon numbers might have left uncondensed and not show presence in liquid product. In case of ethanol, slightly decreased C-yield with ZnGa-ZSM-5 may be due to the same reason as that with methanol. Olefins and oligomers forming from ethanol could be less active towards coke formation and hence relatively less drop in C-yield. Dealumination of ZSM-5 seems to be beneficial from C-yields point of view. Reduced acidity (Table 4) would have prevented excessive cracking and thus enhancing liquid yields, 28% versus 20%. This can be substantiated by higher yield of C9+ aromatics, i.e., the catalyst does allow their formation where as at reaction temperature, dealkylationis expected to be prominent. This observation can further be explained on the basis of textural properties of catalysts, Table 5 , Fig. 1 . Dealumnation gives rise to increased surface area, pore volume, and pore size (20 to 75 Å, Fig. 1). Higher yield of toluene, 11%, may be attributed to reaction between C3 and C4 hydrocarbons being formed as intermediates in the course of oligomerization-cracking cycles and the products subsequently cyclizing. Table 4 recapitulates performance of the same catalysts for 2-propanol aromatization. Trends with regard to C-yields vis-à-vis catalysts’ physico-chemical properties are same as those for ethanol aromatization. Propanol afforded highest C-yields among all three alcohols studied on all catalysts. Propene oligomerization is faster than that of ethane (Eagan et al., 2019). This might have led to higher C-yields from propanol. If toluene to benzene ratio is considered as efficiency of utilization of methyl species, this efficiency follows the trend, methanol > ethanol > propanol. It is understood that population of methyl species formed from each alcohol should explain this order. C-yields observed on various catalysts for n-hexane aromatization can be found in Table 4. Unlike alcohols, n-hexane did not convert completely on dealuminated zeolite. Dealuminated ZnGaZSM-5 showed highest C-yields, 20%, though at lower, 94% conversion of n-hexane. Drop in conversion can be attributed to reduced acidity caused by dealumination. However, maximum aromatic yield afforded by this particular catalyst should be due to increased pore volume and surface area after dealumination. As advanced above, high conversions accompanied by low C-yields may be associated with high coke deposition, again remains to be ascertained. Now, total C-yields and product selectivity obtained on different catalysts from various alkane-alcohol combinations are discussed in light of results summarized Table 4. It is evident that neither metal impregnation nor dealumination helps improve aromatic yield from n-hexane and methanol mixture. Rather, parent ZSM-5 affords maximum yield of 27%. As compared to pure n-hexane, its mixture with methanol provides better yield on parent ZSM-5 and ZnGaZSM-5. Thus, alcohol bolsters alkane’s aromatization. Still, higher aromatic yield on the former catalyst implies that mechanism involved in methanol-to-aromatics plays a predominant role where as n-hexane can be proposed to function as “carbon pool.” Ethanol, n-hexane, and their mixture show 20, 11, and 16% aromatic yield, respectively over parent ZSM-5 which has been discussed earlier. On GaZn-ZSM-5, pure ethanol and n-hexane provide 11–12% C-yield. This value increases to 28% for their equi-volume mixture indicating the supportive role of ethanol in hexane aromatization. Against pure ethanol and hexane, when their mixture contained 25 vol% hexane, the C-yield almost doubled to 24% for ZnGa-ZSM-5. However, excess of hexane (75 vol%) impedes aromatization with C-yield similar to pure hexane. In that case ethanol fails to bolster hexane aromatization. When a mixture with higher hexane proportion was fed at higher flow rate, the C-yield rose to 20%. This implies higher rate of coke formation starting from hexane. Propanol-n-hexane mixture too behaved as the case with methanol over parent ZSM-5. On parent ZSM-5, C-yield of 11% from only n-hexane, the hexane-propanol mixture gave C-yield similar to that from only propanol, 31%. Thus, synergism as just mentioned above applies for this combination also. Dealuminated ZnGaZSM-5, however, showed less C-yield, 24% for the hexane-propanol mixture as feed. Interesting trend has been observed for ZnGa-ZSM-5 catalyst: with gradual increase in propanol proportion in its mixture with hexane, C-yield monotonously rises. A mixture containing 25 vol% propanol and balance hexane provided 23.3% aromatics. In this mixture n-hexane contributed 77% C atoms, (Table 2) i.e., 23.3x 0.77 = 17.94% aromatics came from n-hexane. Thus, [(17.94 – 10.5)/10.5] × 100 = 71%more C from n-hexane could be aromatized in presence of propanol. Propanol produces 36.5 × 0.23 = 8.4% aromatics. But it contributed 5.4%, thus enhanced utilization of n-hexane came at a cost of about 36% C loss from propanol. In fact methyl species utilization efficiency is highest for the mixture containing minimum, 25 vol%, propanol."
5,Time-on-stream behaviour,"3.3 Time-on-stream behaviour Dealuminated ZnGaZSM-5 afforded 100% propanol conversion upto 28 h time-on-stream however, n-hexane conversion dropped to 80% during this period. When an alcohol converts, it first undergoes dehydration. Water formed during this step washes away coke being deposited on catalyst surface (Eagan et al., 2019; Junming and Wang, 2014; Madeira et al., 2012) leading to sustained activity. During this period, aromatic yield too declined. This fall in activity would be due to coke deposition. It is thought that cracking of hexane demands stronger acid sites than that for propanol dehydration. The stronger acid sites are more prone to coking and hence n-hexane conversion suffers with time."
6,Thermogravimetric analysis of coke,"3.4 Thermogravimetric analysis of coke TGA of spent dealuminated GaZnZSM-5 was carried out in presence of air, Fig. 2 . Weight loss between 100 and 350 °C and 350 and 700 °C are attributed to soft coke and hard coke, respectively (Chena and Manos, 2004). Higher mass of soft coke may be due to introduction of hydrogen available from dehydrogenation reactions saturating coke precursors. Presence of Ga also has been shown to enhance hydrogen production (Li et al., 2017) (from alkane dehydrogenation) which in present case would saturate the coke precursors. Similar observation, higher proportion of soft coke formation on Ga and Zn impregnated ZSM-5 has been reported earlier (Vasile, 2018). Coke dissolved solution contained 58% of branched oxygen-containing hydrocarbons in the range of 6–27 carbon atoms, 35% mono-aromatic hydrocarbons and 8% of naphthenes with branches. Understandably, these-large carbonaceous compounds would form on the external surface of the zeolite crystals, with little fraction of active sites, as also Lee et al. (2017) had reported for n-pentane aromatization over zeolite with mesopores. Large fraction of active sites residing inside the crystals, remained active for 28 h with little drop in hexane conversion whereas that of alcohol was still 100%, as mentioned earlier. Polyaromatics are precursors to hard coke formation which were not detected in the CH2Cl2 dissolved coke. Table 6 shows constituent compounds of the soft coke. With an exception of only one compound balance all contained oxygen. It is presumed that alcohols to be the source of oxygen reflected in coke, the speculation which demands further mechanistic study, and not in scope of present work. Though, oxygen can incorporate into coke while catalyst cools under ambient conditions, this might not have contributed significantly due to the fact that almost all compounds carried oxygen with them."
7,Conclusion,"Starting from cheap resources, namely n-hexane, methanol and ethanol (and for the sake of comparison, propanol) valuable aromatics, feed-stocks for petrochemical processes and gasoline-blend, were obtained by their aromatization over parent ZSM-5, GaZn-ZSM-5, and dealuminated GaZn-ZSM-5 catalysts. Presence of an alcohol facilitated aromatization of hexane which otherwise is difficult. Particularly propanol showed a promise to bring in more carbon from hexane into aromatics. Importantly, dealuminated greatly improved liquid yields and liquid products contained only aromatics in addition to unconverted reactants. Dealuminated GzZn-ZSM-5 catalyst showed stable and complete alcohol conversion even at 28 h time-on-stream however hexane conversion dropped to 80% during this period. It is proposed that this deactivation occurs due to coke deposition which forms from hexane cracking. This coke contained a larger fraction of soft coke which in turn contained C6 to C27 oxygenated hydrocarbons."
