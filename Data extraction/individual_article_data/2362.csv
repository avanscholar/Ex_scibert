0,Introduction,"Nowadays, the hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis of biomass-based furfural (FA) or furfuryl alcohol (FFA) to high value-added alcohols or polyols has attracted great attention [1–9]. 1,2-pentanediol (1,2-PeD), as one of the most valuable FFA hydrogenolysis products, is widely applied in cosmetic industry or as a key intermediate of low-toxic microbicides [5]. Therefore, its direct production from FA/FFA under mild conditions has been subject to many active studies. As early as 1930s, CuCr2O4 catalytic systems were found to be active in the direct hydrogenolysis of FA/FFA to pentanediols [10]; however, the existence of Cr in catalysts can cause serious environmental problems, which is not ideal for the modern society. Some fundamental studies in improving this reaction have been reported in recent years [5–8]. For example, a Ru/MnOx system was established and a maximum yield of 42% 1,2-PeD was obtained [5], but the yield of the target product and the stability of this catalytic system are still unsatisfactory. The Mg-Al hydrotalcite-supported Pt catalytic system was also developed with 73% yield of 1,2-PeD from furfural [6], but its large-scale application with good stability is still a challenge [11–13]. Some non-precious metal catalytic systems were also developed. For example, Cu-based systems at relatively harsher reaction conditions were also exploited in recent years; however, the selectivity to 1,2-PeD in those systems still cannot meet the application requirements (lower than 55%) [14,15]. Recently, we found that Pt/CeO2 is excellent for the hydrogenolysis of FA/FFA, with good yields of 1,2-PeD in aqueous phase and green alcohol solvents at 65.5 and 59.9% respectively [7,8]. More importantly, the Pt-CeO2 catalytic system has an admirable durability in alcohol phases, which points to its potential industrial applications [8]. However, the detailed investigation about the roles of Pt and CeO2 in the direct hydrogenolysis of FFA is still lacking, which is necessary for the further improvement of 1,2-PeD selectivity. It is well known that CeO2 is an excellent catalyst or promoter in a large number of reactions [16,17]. Moreover, crystal orientations of CeO2 have been proven to play an important role on the activity and selectivity in a series of reactions [18–21]. For example, different shaped ceria nanocrystals showed significantly different selectivities for ethanol oxidation [19]; also, the activity of C2H2 hydrogenation and CO oxidation was found to be ceria-shape-dependent [20]. For CeO2 supported metal catalysts, the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) is often observed [22–26], which can dramatically promote the rate, and more importantly, tune the pathways of some reactions [25]. For instance, the effect of CeO2 crystal plane on the activity of Au/CeO2 in the water gas shift reaction was reported [24]; Pd/CeO2 catalysts with different ceria crystal planes were found to exhibit totally different activities for CO and propane oxidation [27]; shaped Pt/CeO2 catalysts showed dramatically different activities in quinolines hydrogenation [26]. Moreover, Ir/CeO2 catalytic systems with different Ir contents were proved to have different chemical states, which is induced by SMSI effect, and dramatically affects the reaction pathways of CO2 hydrogenation [25]. In the hydrogenolysis of FA/FFA over Pt/CeO2 catalytic systems, there are two competitive pathways: furan ring opening and saturation (Scheme 1 ), which lead to different products, namely, 1,2-PeD/1,5-PeD or tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA). We aim to utilize the CeO2 morphological effect and optimize the interaction between loaded Pt and ceria to enhance the selectivity of 1,2-PeD in the direct FA/FFA hydrogenolysis. Previous studies [7,8] illustrated that FFA is firstly obtained during the hydrogenolysis of FA to 1,2-PeD, so we choose FFA as the substrate to simplify the investigation in this work. Herein, CeO2 nanocrystals with different morphologies (nanorod, nanocube and octahedron) were used to load Pt, and their effect in FFA hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis was investigated from a microscopic view. It is found that the chemical state of supported Pt species can be tuned by the exposed planes of the CeO2, which leads to significantly different selectivities to 1,2-PeD during the FFA hydrogenolysis. A 77% yield of 1,2-PeD (the total pentanediol yield up to 84%) was achieved over CeO2 nanocubes supported Pt catalyst, which is at the highest level till now. This study provides a first step to the detailed understanding of the direct hydrogenolysis of furan rings over excellent Pt-based CeO2 catalytic systems."

2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Ceria nanorods (CeO2-R) and nanocubes (CeO2-C) were prepared by the hydrolysis of Ce (III) ions in a condensed NaOH solution, followed by a hydrothermal treatment [28]. Typically, 1.736 g Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and 19.2 g NaOH were dissolved in 10 and 70 mL of deionized water, respectively. After the mixing of two solutions, the mixture was kept stirring for another 30 min. Then, the sealed Teflon bottle with suspension was placed in a stainless steel autoclave, and hydrothermally treated at 100 °C and 180 °C for 24 h to obtain the ceria nanorods and ceria cubes, respectively. The formed solids were separated by filtration and washed by deionized water until the pH of the filtrate is close to 7, followed by drying at 100 °C for 12 h and calcining at 500 °C for 3 h in air. For the synthesis of ceria octahedron (CeO2-O) [29], 0.858 g Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and 0.0076 g Na3PO4·12H2O were firstly dissolved in 10 and 70 mL of deionized water, respectively. Then, these two solutions were mixed together, and stirred for another 30 min. After sealing the Teflon bottle in a stainless steel autoclave, the mixture were heated at 170 °C for 10 h. The gained solids were separated by centrifugation and washed by deionized water and methanol for several times. The samples were dried at 100 °C for 12 h, followed by calcining at 500 °C for 3 h in air. All Pt/CeO2 samples are prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method. Typically, an aqueous solution of Pt(NO3)2 was mixed with CeO2 supports and stirred to get a slurry. The slurry was dried at 50 °C for 12 h, and 100 °C for another 12 h. Then the solids were calcined at 500 °C for 3 h, and labeled as n%PtOx/CeO2-M (n is the Pt loading amount and M denotes the ceria morphology). Before use, the catalysts were reduced at 300 °C for 2 h under 10% H2-Ar mixed gas, and labeled as n%Pt/CeO2-M. The Pt loading in catalysts was confirmed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES)."
3,Catalysts activity tests,"2.2 Catalysts activity tests The hydrogenolysis of furfuryl alcohol was conducted in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (50 mL). After sealing the desired dosage of FFA, catalyst and solvent in the reactor, the autoclave was purged with H2 three times and pressurized to the desired pressure. Then, the autoclave was heated to the predetermined temperature in a short time. After reaction, the reactor was quenched in an ice-water bath immediately. The liquid phase was separated from the catalyst by centrifugation, and two individual GC/GC-MS systems were used for product analyses. The qualitative analysis of products was carried out on a GC-MS system (Agilent 7890A-5975C), and the quantitative analysis was executed on a GC system (Agilent 7890B) equipped with an HP-5 column and an FID detector."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The synthesized Pt/CeO2 catalysts were characterized extensively to full understand the structure-property relationships of the catalytic system. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded in the θ –2θ mode on a D8 Focus diffractometer (CuKα1 radiation, k = 1.5406 Å), operated at 40 kV and 40 mA within scattering angels of 10–80°. Nitrogen sorption measurements were performed on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020M sorption analyzer. The samples were degassed at 200 °C for 6 h, and measured at −196 °C. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method was adopted to calculate the specific surface area. Chemical analysis of samples was performed by an Agilent 725ES inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of samples were recorded on a Nova NanoSEM 450 microscopy at 3 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of samples were obtained on a JEOL Model 2100F electron microscopy at 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded on a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250 Xi system with monochromatic Al Kα radiation, and the results were calibrated using the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. The Raman spectra were obtained on a Renishaw inVia Reflex spectrometer under ambient conditions, and the 532 nm line of a Spectra Physics Ar+ laser was used for the excitation. The CO-pulse adsorption was performed at 25 °C (CO:Pt = 1:1) on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 system. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (DRIFTS) of CO-adsorption were recorded on a Nicolet Model iS-50 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with an MCT/A detector, and the sample cell was fitted with ZnSe windows. The FT-IR spectra of CO-adsorption (1% CO/Ar) were recorded with a resolution of 4 cm−1 and 32 scans. Before tests, every sample was in situ reduced by 5%H2/Ar at 300 °C. H2-TPR was carried out on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 System in 10%H2/He, and 0.10 g sample was loaded each time. XAS measurements were conducted at the Canadian Light Source for the Pt L3-edge on the IDEAS beamline. Pt foil was used for energy calibration and both fluorescence and transmission yields were recorded. For samples with low Pt loading, fluorescence spectra were reported. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses were performed using Athena/Artemis software. For R-space fitting, the amplitude of Pt was determined by fitting the Pt foil spectrum and Pt-Pt and Pt-O scattering paths of Pt foil and Pt3O4 and PtO2 were generated by FEFF. E0 and coordination number are the main variables in order to achieve the best fit."

6,Characterization of the supports and catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of the supports and catalysts Three types of CeO2 supported Pt catalysts (4.5%Pt/CeO2-R, 4.5%Pt/CeO2-C, and 4.5%Pt/CeO2-O) were prepared successfully (all reduced at 300 °C for 2 h), and all CeO2 nanocrystals showed well-defined shapes, which were confirmed by both SEM and TEM observations (Fig. 1 ). In general, CeO2-R is supposed to expose mainly CeO2 (1 1 0) and (1 0 0) facets, CeO2-C tends to expose (1 0 0) facets, and CeO2-O mainly exposes (1 1 1) facet [21,27–29]. To confirm the exact terminal facets of our CeO2-rod sample, HR-TEM was used, and the as-synthesized CeO2-R sample indeed had the terminal facets of (1 1 0) and (1 0 0) (Fig. 1G). The TEM images also illustrate the average size and size distribution of various CeO2 supported Pt nanoparticles, which is 2.4 nm for Pt/CeO2-R, 4.1 nm for Pt/CeO2-C, and 5.9 nm for Pt/CeO2-O. The ICP-AES results verified an approximately 4.5% Pt content over all samples (Table 1 ). The phases of Pt and CeO2 over three catalysts were evaluated by XRD measurement and displayed in Fig. 2 . It can be seen that the diffraction peaks attributed a typical cubic fluoride CeO2 crystal structure are obvious in all three catalysts, but the intensity of diffraction peak (39.8°) attributed to Pt(1 1 1) [30] is different. No diffraction peak was found over 4.5%Pt/CeO2-R at 39.8°, indicating that small Pt particles are well dispersed over CeO2-R supports. However, broad peak at 39.8° is found over 4.5%Pt/CeO2-C and 4.5%Pt/CeO2-O catalysts. And 4.5%Pt/CeO2-O catalyst exhibits the strongest diffraction intensity of Pt(1 1 1), implying it has largest particle size among all three supports. The Pt dispersion (DPt) of 4.5%Pt/CeO2 samples, measured by CO-pulse adsorption, also clearly illustrates the diverse dispersion in these three catalysts, which is 41% for Pt/CeO2-R, 22% for Pt/CeO2-C, and 9% for Pt/CeO2-O (Table 1), this result is well consistent with XRD and TEM characterizations. The specific surface area of these catalysts measured by N2 adsorption is 75.2, 10.8 and 8.5 m2 g−1, respectively (Table 1). The Pt/CeO2-R catalyst owns the highest specific surface area, while Pt/CeO2-C and Pt/CeO2-O catalysts exhibit similar and lower surface area."
7,Catalytic performance of shaped Pt/CeO2 nanocrystals,"3.2 Catalytic performance of shaped Pt/CeO2 nanocrystals The catalytic performances of these Pt/CeO2 catalysts (Pt loading: 4.5%) for the hydrogenolysis of FFA were investigated in ethanol (EtOH) at 165 °C, and the time courses of the reaction over all three systems were collected and presented in Fig. 3 . Significant difference is observed for the 12 h-performances of these catalytic systems. The conversion of FFA is 71.3% over Pt/CeO2-R catalyst with 58.1% selectivity to 1,2-PeD (Fig. 3A), 94.2% over Pt/CeO2-C catalyst with 77.0% selectivity to 1,2-PeD (Fig. 3B), and 84.1% over Pt/CeO2-O catalyst with 75.0% selectivity to 1,2-PeD (Fig. 3C). It is clear that 4.5%Pt/CeO2-C catalyst has both the highest conversion and selectivity among all three catalytic systems. The 24 h-performances of various 4.5%Pt/CeO2 catalysts show the same trend and the data are summarized in Table S1. It is noted that the yield to pentanediols over 4.5%Pt/CeO2-C catalyst reached 84.4% (77.1% 1,2-PeD and 7.3% 1,5-PeD, Table S1, entry 2), which is among the best of reported FA or FFA hydrogenolysis [4–6,14]. Furthermore, the control experiments of pure CeO2 catalysts (without Pt) clearly show that these systems have no activity in the hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis of FFA (Table S1, entry 4–6), indicating that CeO2 support itself is not active for the investigated hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis reaction and the co-existence of Pt with CeO2 support is essential for this catalytic system. Moreover, the performance of these 4.5%Pt/CeO2 catalysts is stable, with no deactivation or the variation of product distributions during 5 runs (Fig. S1), despite a slight loss of Pt content in the spent catalysts (Table 1) [8]. All used catalysts maintained their morphologies and phase composition after durability tests (Figs. S2 and S3). Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2018.07.023. The catalytic performances of these Pt/CeO2 catalysts (Pt loading: 4.5%) for the hydrogenolysis of FFA were investigated in ethanol (EtOH) at 165 °C, and the time courses of the reaction over all three systems were collected and presented in Fig. 3 . Significant difference is observed for the 12 h-performances of these catalytic systems. The conversion of FFA is 71.3% over Pt/CeO2-R catalyst with 58.1% selectivity to 1,2-PeD (Fig. 3A), 94.2% over Pt/CeO2-C catalyst with 77.0% selectivity to 1,2-PeD (Fig. 3B), and 84.1% over Pt/CeO2-O catalyst with 75.0% selectivity to 1,2-PeD (Fig. 3C). It is clear that 4.5%Pt/CeO2-C catalyst has both the highest conversion and selectivity among all three catalytic systems. The 24 h-performances of various 4.5%Pt/CeO2 catalysts show the same trend and the data are summarized in Table S1 . It is noted that the yield to pentanediols over 4.5%Pt/CeO2-C catalyst reached 84.4% (77.1% 1,2-PeD and 7.3% 1,5-PeD, Table S1, entry 2), which is among the best of reported FA or FFA hydrogenolysis [4–6,14]. Furthermore, the control experiments of pure CeO2 catalysts (without Pt) clearly show that these systems have no activity in the hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis of FFA (Table S1, entry 4–6), indicating that CeO2 support itself is not active for the investigated hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis reaction and the co-existence of Pt with CeO2 support is essential for this catalytic system.

All used catalysts maintained their morphologies and phase composition after durability tests (Figs. S2 and S3). The collected time courses (Fig. 3) were further analyzed to clarify the reaction pathways. It shows that with the extension of reaction time, the conversion of FFA increases gradually, while the products’ distribution remains mostly steady in all three catalytic systems, indicating that the furan ring opening and saturating reaction pathways are in parallel. Furthermore, the steady selectivity to 1,2-PeD over each catalyst at different time makes it possible to identify the key point to control reaction routes, which will be discussed in the following section. The drastically different catalytic performance among these three Pt/CeO2 catalysts was further confirmed in reactions with other primary alcohols, including 1-propanol and 1-butanol (Table S2). These findings suggest that the influence of Pt/CeO2 surface structures on the catalytic behavior is universal during FFA hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis.

These findings suggest that the influence of Pt/CeO2 surface structures on the catalytic behavior is universal during FFA hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis. The influences of some other reaction parameters, including initial H2 pressure and reaction temperature were also investigated. With the increase of the initial H2 pressure, only a slight decrease of 1,2-PeD selectivity (in contrast, a tiny increase of THFA selectivity) was observed over all three catalysts (Fig. S4). However, the reaction temperature was found to influence the product distributions dramatically (Table S3). At lower temperature (70 °C), the conversion of FFA and the selectivity to 1,2-PeD are all lower than those at high temperature (165 °C), independent of the catalysts used, indicating that high reaction temperature promotes the direct ring-opening of FFA and leads to higher selectivity to 1,2-PeD. The results of the initial H2 pressure and temperature influences over the direct FFA hydrogenolysis are in line with our previous findings [8]. The influences of some other reaction parameters, including initial H2 pressure and reaction temperature were also investigated.

The results of the initial H2 pressure and temperature influences over the direct FFA hydrogenolysis are in line with our previous findings [8]."
8,The critical role of Pt chemical state toward hydrogenolysis of furfuryl alcohol,"3.3 The critical role of Pt chemical state toward hydrogenolysis of furfuryl alcohol Aforementioned catalytic results show that different shaped CeO2 supported Pt catalyst has different activity and selectivity to 1,2-PeD during FFA hydrogenolysis process, while the selectivity to 1,2-PeD remains steady with the increase of FFA conversion in each catalytic system. Therefore, it is critical to identify the key properties of catalyst to control the selectivity of 1,2-PeD during FFA. Catalytic results show that a highest activity and selectivity to pentanediol was realized over 4.5%Pt/CeO2-C catalyst, but characterizations show that it has medium BET specific area and Pt dispersion (DPt) among the investigated catalysts, this indicates that the BET specific area and Pt dispersion (DPt) are not key properties in controlling the selectivity of FFA hydrogenolysis. Very recently, the supported Pt [31] and Ir particles [25] with a variety of chemical states, tuned by different methods, have been reported to have an enormous influence on the reaction rate or reaction pathways. We wonder if the Pt chemical state over different CeO2 supports is a crucial factor for the transformation of FFA to 1,2-PeD. To clarify the Pt chemical state, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray adsorption near-edge structure (XANES) analyses were carried out. Firstly, the XPS spectra of three unreduced samples were recorded and presented in Fig. 4 A. The Pt 4f7/2 orbital shows two peaks in all tested samples, in the range of 72.5 ∼ 73.5 eV and 74.0 ∼ 75.0 eV, which are assigned to Pt(II) and Pt(IV) surface species, respectively [31]. Interestingly, the XPS spectra show that the Pt 4f peaks of CeO2-R are 0.6 ∼ 0.7 eV higher than those over CeO2-C and CeO2-O, indicating the different electronic effect between Pt and shaped ceria. Furthermore, the ratio of surface Pt(IV)/Pt(II) species over 4.5%PtOx/CeO2-O sample (0.80) is significantly higher than those over other unreduced catalysts, which is 0.20 for 4.5%PtOx/CeO2-R and 0.15 for 4.5%PtOx/CeO2-C, indicating that 4.5%PtOx/CeO2-O contains more surface Pt(IV) species. As the Pt precursor used in this work is Pt(II) salt, the significantly higher Pt(IV) signal for the 4.5%PtOx/CeO2-O sample means that Pt species can be easily oxidized in air during calcination, suggesting that the interaction between Pt and CeO2-O support is relatively weak. We then carefully examined the XPS spectra of the reduced catalysts (Fig. 4B). Surprisingly, the reduced surface Pt species over 4.5%Pt/CeO2-R catalyst has a 4f7/2 binding energy (B.E.) of 71.8 eV, which is higher than the typical B.E. of 71.2 eV for metallic Pt (Pt0) [26], indicating that it is partially positive charged (Ptδ+). However, in the cases of 4.5%Pt/CeO2-C and 4.5%Pt/CeO2-O, the reduced Pt species exhibit as its metallic state (71.2 eV, Pt0) with a small amount of Pt2+, the latter may come from the surface oxidation of Pt (being supported by XAS and Raman results below). These XPS results suggest that there is strong interaction between Pt and CeO2-R for the Pt/CeO2-R catalyst (higher B.E. values for samples before and after reduction), while the interaction between Pt and shaped CeO2 is weakest in the Pt/CeO2-O sample. Pt L3-edge XANES spectra for three shaped 4.5%Pt/CeO2 catalysts, together with those of Pt foil and one example of the original catalyst, 4.5%PtOx/CeO2-R, were shown in Fig. 5 to comprehensively assess the Pt states in different Pt/CeO2 catalysts. In general, a large ‘white line’ refers to the more oxidized Pt, whereas a small one indicates the reduced-state of Pt species [22,32]. In our cases, after reduction at 300 °C for 2 h, the Pt species over CeO2-R support shows a significantly large ‘white line’ but still much smaller than that over the original sample (4.5%PtOx/CeO2-R). While the Pt species over CeO2-C and CeO2-O supports have small ‘white line’ and more similar to Pt foil. These results indicate that the Pt species over 4.5%Pt/CeO2-R catalyst is much harder to be reduced to a Pt0 state, likely due to the strong Pt and CeO2-R interaction, in agreement with the XPS results. To further confirm the Pt chemical state, FTIR spectra of CO-adsorption on different Pt/CeO2 catalysts were also collected (Fig. 6 ). Due to the poor signal and low CO-adsorption amount over Pt/CeO2-O (quite low Pt dispersion) (Fig. S5), Pt/CeO2-O is excluded from the comparison. The linear CO-adsorption peak of 4.5%Pt/CeO2-R shows a 6 cm−1 blue shift (2058 cm−1) compared with that of 4.5%Pt/CeO2-C (2052 cm−1), which obviously indicates the electronic deficiency of the loaded Pt over 4.5%Pt/CeO2-R catalyst [33]. To further confirm the Pt chemical state, FTIR spectra of CO-adsorption on different Pt/CeO2 catalysts were also collected (Fig. 6 ). Due to the poor signal and low CO-adsorption amount over Pt/CeO2-O (quite low Pt dispersion) (Fig. S5), Pt/CeO2-O is excluded from the comparison. The linear CO-adsorption peak of 4.5%Pt/CeO2-R shows a 6 cm−1 blue shift (2058 cm−1) compared with that of 4.5%Pt/CeO2-C (2052 cm−1), which obviously indicates the electronic deficiency of the loaded Pt over 4.5%Pt/CeO2-R catalyst [33]. So far, characterizations by XPS, XANES and FTIR have demonstrated that there is significant difference in Pt chemical states over these three 4.5%Pt/CeO2 catalysts, which influences their catalytic performance. 4.5%Pt/CeO2-R catalyst with partially positive charged Ptδ+ species shows relatively low conversion and poor 1,2-PeD selectivity, while the other two catalysts with metallic Pt species (Pt0) exhibit both high reaction activity and excellent 1,2-PeD selectivity. Therefore, we can conclude that Pt chemical states over ceria supports should be one of the key factors in controlling the activity and selectivity during the direct hydrogenolysis of FFA, and the Pt0 species are more favorable for the formation of pentanediol. The difference in the reaction performance (mainly conversion) between 4.5%Pt/CeO2-C and 4.5%Pt/CeO2-O catalysts, despite their similar Pt surface state, may arise from their different Pt particle sizes (5.9 nm for Pt/CeO2-O vs. 4.1 nm for Pt/CeO2-C), induced by the different interaction between Pt and shaped CeO2. As discussed above, Pt has the weakest interaction with CeO2-O, leading to the larger average Pt nanoparticle size, and normally large-sized particles have a relatively poor hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis activity. A very recent study [25] pointed out that changing the metal loading over CeO2 can change the electronic structure of loaded metal sites. To further verify if the Pt0 species is the key active site for 1,2-PeD formation, a series of Pt/CeO2-C catalysts with different Pt loadings were evaluated by controlling the conversion of FFA at around 50% (Table 2 ). It is found that higher Pt loading is apt to promote the cleavage of C-O bond (1,2-PeD), and restrain the total hydrogenation of furan rings (Table 2, entry 1–3), while lower loading in CeO2-C leads to furan ring hydrogenation (THFA). This is because that in low Pt loading (1.0%) catalyst, Pt is more positively charged (the B.E. value of 71.6 eV, XPS in Fig. S6); and on average, the interaction between Pt and CeO2-C is stronger (more CeO2 to react with a smaller amount of Pt). This electronic effect over low-Pt-content Pt/CeO2-C is further validated by both CO-adsorption experiment (Fig. 6) and Pt L3-edge XANES spectra of Pt/CeO2-C catalysts with different Pt loading (Fig. S7). A very recent study [25] pointed out that changing the metal loading over CeO2 can change the electronic structure of loaded metal sites. To further verify if the Pt0 species is the key active site for 1,2-PeD formation, a series of Pt/CeO2-C catalysts with different Pt loadings were evaluated by controlling the conversion of FFA at around 50% (Table 2 ). It is found that higher Pt loading is apt to promote the cleavage of C-O bond (1,2-PeD), and restrain the total hydrogenation of furan rings (Table 2, entry 1–3), while lower loading in CeO2-C leads to furan ring hydrogenation (THFA). This is because that in low Pt loading (1.0%) catalyst, Pt is more positively charged (the B.E. value of 71.6 eV, XPS in Fig. S6); and on average, the interaction between Pt and CeO2-C is stronger (more CeO2 to react with a smaller amount of Pt). This electronic effect over low-Pt-content Pt/CeO2-C is further validated by both CO-adsorption experiment (Fig. 6) and Pt L3-edge XANES spectra of Pt/CeO2-C catalysts with different Pt loading (Fig. S7). Also, a series of controlled experiments were carried out by comparing the catalytic performances of these unreduced and reduced 4.5%Pt/CeO2 catalysts, and the results are shown in Table S4. It can be seen that the unreduced samples of 4.5%PtOx/CeO2-R and 4.5%PtOx/CeO2-C have low activity and a drastic fall in PeD selectivity (at the same time, a significant increase in THFA selectivity) compared with reduced ones. These phenomena indicate that the initial Pt species’ state over CeO2 can deeply influence both activity and selectivity during the FFA hydrogenolysis process, which is in line with the results aforementioned. However, the unreduced 4.5%PtOx/CeO2-O catalyst shows a similar PeD selectivity and a tiny decrease in conversion, which suggests it to be an exception. But after analyzing the H2-TPR profiles (Fig. 7 ), it can be easily understood by the extremely easy reduction of Pt species over the CeO2-O support (ultra-low reduction temperature), which means this unreduced sample can be rapidly reduced to an almost equal state as the corresponding reduced catalyst under the reaction conditions, and has no contradictory to our conclusions. Also, a series of controlled experiments were carried out by comparing the catalytic performances of these unreduced and reduced 4.5%Pt/CeO2 catalysts, and the results are shown in Table S4. It can be seen that the unreduced samples of 4.5%PtOx/CeO2-R and 4.5%PtOx/CeO2-C have low activity and a drastic fall in PeD selectivity (at the same time, a significant increase in THFA selectivity) compared with reduced ones. These phenomena indicate that the initial Pt species’ state over CeO2 can deeply influence both activity and selectivity during the FFA hydrogenolysis process, which is in line with the results aforementioned. However, the unreduced 4.5%PtOx/CeO2-O catalyst shows a similar PeD selectivity and a tiny decrease in conversion, which suggests it to be an exception. But after analyzing the H2-TPR profiles (Fig. 7 ), it can be easily understood by the extremely easy reduction of Pt species over the CeO2-O support (ultra-low reduction temperature), which means this unreduced sample can be rapidly reduced to an almost equal state as the corresponding reduced catalyst under the reaction conditions, and has no contradictory to our conclusions. These evidences unambiguously prove that the Pt chemical state on CeO2 supports has a strong impact on the selectivity of 1,2-PeD during the direct FFA hydrogenolysis, and the supported Pt in metallic state (Pt0) has a higher selectivity to 1,2-PeD."
9,The essence of the different Pt chemical states over shaped CeO2 supports,"3.4 The essence of the different Pt chemical states over shaped CeO2 supports The aforementioned results point out that the terminally exposed facets of CeO2 strongly tune the electronic structure of loaded Pt, which in turn affects the selectivity of 1,2-PeD. To further understand the nature of the different electronic structure of supported Pt over different CeO2 crystal facets, we conducted more characterizations to relate the detailed structures of shaped Pt/CeO2 catalytic systems with this electronic effect. H2 temperature-programmed reduction analysis (H2-TPR) was introduced firstly to determine the relative strength of the interaction between Pt species and CeO2 supports with different morphologies (Fig. 7). For 4.5%PtOx/CeO2-R, three groups of peaks appear on H2-TPR, which are at 50, 112 and 350 °C, respectively. The peak at ca. 350 °C is usually attributed to the reduction of ceria surface oxygen, and the reduction peaks below 200 °C can be attributed to the reduction of Pt species. However, on 4.5%PtOx/CeO2-R, the Pt reduction peaks further split into two major groups, which can be ascribed to: (i) reduction of weak interacted Pt species (peaks at 40 °C and 60 °C), and (ii) reduction of Pt species interacted strongly with the CeO2-R support (the intense broad peak at 112 °C). For 4.5%PtOx/CeO2-C, only one Pt reduction peak appears at 68 °C; meanwhile, for the 4.5%PtOx/CeO2-O catalyst, there is only one high temperature peak at 263 °C with no reduction peak below 200 °C. The reduction peak centered at 263 °C can be regarded as the reduction of surface oxygen from CeO2 rather than that from Pt species, because a very recent work [34] indicated that the reduction of Pt single-atom sites with extremely strong metal-support interaction is at ca. 185 °C. More importantly, the H2 consumption of 4.5%Pt/CeO2-R is much higher than the rest of catalysts (Fig. 7), due to the strong H2-spillover effect [27,35], which comes from the high surface area and reducibility of CeO2-R. Generally, a higher surface area [36] or a better reducibility [37] of the support can enhance the hydrogen spillover. Overall, our H2-TPR results suggest that Pt species interacted most strongly with CeO2-R support, while weakly with CeO2-C and CeO2-O. The weak interaction results in the easy reduction of Pt species and correspondingly high activity and selectivity to 1,2-PeD. It is widely accepted that the vacancy formation energy of different ceria surfaces follow a sequence: (1 1 1) > (1 0 0) > (1 1 0) [38,39]. Therefore, additional analyses were carried out in order to study if the electronic effect of Pt-ceria systems is closely related to the defect formation property of CeO2 substrates. Firstly, we assessed the vacancy concentration over these three catalysts by Ce 3d XPS analysis. The Ce3+ concentration calculated by XPS spectra of Ce 3d (Fig. S8) can be used to estimate the oxygen vacancy over the ceria surface [27,40]. The result (Table S5) shows that the Ce3+ concentration of these catalysts follows the order of 4.5%Pt/CeO2-R (24.1%) > 4.5%Pt/CeO2-C (22.6%) > 4.5%Pt/CeO2-O (20.8%), indicating CeO2-R containing (1 1 0) and (1 0 0) planes can easily form oxygen vacancy and CeO2-O with (1 1 1) planes the hardest. Raman spectra were used to clarify the state of supports (Fig. 8 ). It is clear that all CeO2 supports show the characteristics of the typical cubic fluoride structure (Fig. 8A) [41], with four peaks centered at 260, 461, 598, and 1174 cm−1, respectively. The main peak at ca. 463 cm−1 is attributed to the Raman-active vibrational mode (F2g) of fluorite-type structure, while the other peaks are assigned to second-order transverse acoustic (2TA) mode, a defect-induced (D) mode, and a second-order longitudinal optical (2LO) mode, respectively [27,42]. The ratio of I598/I461 in the Raman spectra of bare CeO2 nanocrystals can reflect the intrinsic defect concentration over these CeO2 supports [42,43]. The calculated I598/I461 ratio of synthesized bare CeO2 supports is in order of CeO2-R (0.051) > CeO2-C (0.022) > CeO2-O (0.020), indicating that the CeO2-R has significantly more oxygen defects than other shaped ceria, in agreement with the XPS analysis. The trends of Ce3+ concentration and I598/I461 ratio are nicely correlated with that of the Pt state, i.e., the high defect concentration on ceria favors the electron-withdraw from supported Pt species, leading to partially positive charged Pt species in Pt/CeO2-R. Firstly, we assessed the vacancy concentration over these three catalysts by Ce 3d XPS analysis. The Ce3+ concentration calculated by XPS spectra of Ce 3d (Fig. S8) can be used to estimate the oxygen vacancy over the ceria surface [27,40]. The result (Table S5) shows that the Ce3+ concentration of these catalysts follows the order of 4.5%Pt/CeO2-R (24.1%) > 4.5%Pt/CeO2-C (22.6%) > 4.5%Pt/CeO2-O (20.8%), indicating CeO2-R containing (1 1 0) and (1 0 0) planes can easily form oxygen vacancy and CeO2-O with (1 1 1) planes the hardest.

The trends of Ce3+ concentration and I598/I461 ratio are nicely correlated with that of the Pt state, i.e., the high defect concentration on ceria favors the electron-withdraw from supported Pt species, leading to partially positive charged Pt species in Pt/CeO2-R. The Raman spectra analysis of Pt-loaded samples was also conducted as well (Fig. 8B and C). After calcination of Pt-impregnated samples (Fig. 8B), two additional peaks appeared at around 550 and 665 cm−1 for PtOx/CeO2-R and PtOx/CeO2-C, which can be assigned to Pt-O-Ce and Pt-O bands over CeO2 supports, respectively, and indicating the strong interaction between PtOx and CeO2 [44]. However, in the case of PtOx/CeO2-O, only a tiny new broad peak was observed at ca. 600 cm−1, which can be assigned to the vibration of amorphous PtO2 over CeO2-O [44]. This observation is consistent with our XPS results (Fig. 4), and suggests the lack of strong interaction between Pt species and CeO2-O support. After reduction (Fig. 8C), the peaks at around 550 and 665 cm−1 partially remained in Pt/CeO2-R and Pt/CeO2-C, while the peak at 600 cm−1 almost disappeared in Pt/CeO2-O. As the metallic Pt species (Pt0) are Raman-inactive, the disappearance of 600 cm−1 peak over reduced 4.5%Pt/CeO2-O indicated the well-reduced state of Pt species, in accordance with XPS, XAS and H2-TPR results. Overall, we can conclude that Pt species have a weak interaction with (1 1 1) facet of CeO2, but a relatively strong interaction with (1 1 0) or (1 0 0) facet. Especially, the extremely strong interaction between Pt and (1 1 0) facet limits the reduction of Pt species over CeO2-R, which results in the poor activity and selectivity to 1,2-PeD over Pt/CeO2-R in the hydrogenolysis of furfural alcohol. For Pt/CeO2-C, there is strong Pt-ceria interaction as indicated by its Raman spectrum, this interaction is not as strong as that over CeO2-R, so Pt species can still be reduced into Pt0 states with small particle size (4.1 nm), which is beneficial for ring-opening reaction. Namely, on the premise of the existence of sufficient Pt0, the Pt/CeO2 catalytic systems with smaller sizes and narrower size distribution will perform better in FFA hydrogenolysis towards 1,2-PeD. Fig. 9 shows the Fourier-transformed Pt L3-edge EXAFS plots in R space for Pt/CeO2-R, Pt/CeO2-C and Pt/CeO2-O catalysts, together with the fitted results. The fitting results are presented in Table 3 . It is found that with the change of supports’ morphologies, the bonding environment for these samples changed dramatically. A combination of Pt and PtO2 pathways yields the best fit for 4.5%Pt/CeO2-C and 4.5%Pt/CeO2-O catalysts, with the latter dominated by the Pt-Pt path and has a very high coordination number (CN). This is in agreement with the XRD, XPS and XANES results since 4.5%Pt/CeO2-O is most metallic Pt like with the largest particle size among the three catalysts. For 4.5%Pt/CeO2-R catalyst, a best fit was obtained using Pt3O4 only, with no inclusion of Pt foil. In comparison to the other catalysts, 4.5%Pt/CeO2-R has a smaller combined CNs of Pt-O and Pt-Pt, consistent with the above results (it has smallest particle size and best dispersion). Both the oxidized nature and the lower CN indicate that the Pt species interacted strongly with the oxygen atoms over CeO2-R supports, while the 4.5%Pt/CeO2-O is mostly reduced under the same the treatment condition due to its weak Pt-CeO2 interaction. The EXAFS analysis, combined with the H2-TPR profile, firmly proves the differences in the metal-support interaction between Pt and different CeO2 supports, which could result in the difference in their reducibility of Pt species and the catalytic performance."
10,Conclusion,"In this work, the fine-shaped CeO2 nanocrystals with different exposed crystal surfaces were used as Pt supports to investigate the relationship of crystal planes with the catalytic performance during the hydrogenolysis of FFA to 1,2-PeD in alcohol solvent. It is found that CeO2-C exposed (1 0 0) facets has a very high yield of 1,2-PeD (up to 77%) after loading with 4.5 wt% Pt, slightly higher than that (74.9%) over 4.5%Pt/CeO2-O catalyst (mainly exposed CeO2 (1 1 1) facets) and much higher than that (48.5%) over 4.5%Pt/CeO2-R catalyst (exposed CeO2 (1 1 0) and (1 0 0) facets) under the same reaction conditions (165 °C, 24 h). Meanwhile, all the catalysts exhibit excellent durability. Detailed investigations showed that the selectivity to 1,2-PeD is intimately related with the chemical states of Pt and metallic state Pt (Pt0) is beneficial for the direct cleavage of C-O in the furan ring, which in tune was controlled by the interaction between Pt species and CeO2 facets due to the different oxygen vacancy formation energy of CeO2 (1 1 0), (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) planes. Pt/CeO2-C has the best activity and selectivity to 1,2-PeD because of its metallic state and small particle size of Pt, which comes from the proper interaction between Pt species and CeO2. This study illustrates the promising application of Pt/CeO2 in the production of 1,2-PeD from biomass-derived furfuryl alcohol, and clearly points out that the rational optimization of Pt chemical states and particle size by the CeO2 preparation methods should be one of the major focuses in this process."
