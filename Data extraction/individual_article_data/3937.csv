0,Introduction,"With increasing concerns about energy depletion and air pollution caused by the use of fossil fuels, it is more important to find a way for obtaining “green” energy. Hydrogen is considered as a promising energy carrier due to its clean and non-polluting nature [1–4]. In particular, technological advances in hydrogen utilization areas such as fuel cells make hydrogen more important as a new fuel [5,6]. In recent years, considerable efforts have been made in developing processes for hydrogen production from renewable energy sources such as biomass [7,8]. Among various fuel sources for hydrogen production, light alcohols such as methanol and ethanol have attracted much attention, because they can be easily handled and are widely distributed around the world [9,10]. In particular, ethanol has been utilized as a promising hydrogen source because of its low toxicity, high volumetric energy density, and availability [11]. Hydrogen can be obtained directly from ethanol via several catalytic reactions, including steam reforming [12–15], partial oxidation [16], and auto-thermal reforming [17,18]. Among these catalytic reaction technologies, auto-thermal reforming, which consists of a combination of steam reforming and partial oxidation, has been widely employed as a feasible hydrogen production technology for on-board fuel processors [19,20]. In hydrogen production by auto-thermal reforming of ethanol, nickel-based catalysts have been widely investigated due to their excellent C–C bond cleavage activity and low cost [21,22]. The auto-thermal reforming of ethanol over supported Ni catalysts has been studied by several research groups [23–28]. The Ni-based catalysts examined in the auto-thermal reforming of ethanol include Ni/CeO2 [23], Ni/CeO2–ZrO2 [24], Ni–Rh/CeO2 [25], Ni/MgO [26], Ni–Cu/Al2O3 [27], and Ni–Mo/Al2O3 [28]. The identity of support strongly affects the catalytic performance of supported nickel catalysts in the auto-thermal reforming of ethanol. In a previous work [29], it was reported that Ni catalyst supported on ZrO2 showed better catalytic performance than that supported on ZnO, MgO, TiO2, and Al2O3 in hydrogen production by auto-thermal reforming of ethanol. This is because electronic structure of nickel species supported on ZrO2 was favorably modified for the reaction. However, main drawback in the application of ZrO2 as a supporting material is its low surface area and weak mechanical stability at high reaction temperatures. According to the literature [30], ceria retains an excellent ability to store, release, and transport oxygen in the oxidation reaction. It is well known that electronic configuration of cerium atom is easily adjusted to fit its immediate environment. Under a certain reduction condition, an oxygen atom moves away from the lattice of CeO2 leaving two electrons behind. These electrons then localize on two cerium atoms, changing Ce4+ atoms to Ce3+ atoms [31]. In this work, Ce-modified mesoporous zirconia supports were prepared by a templating sol–gel method with a variation of Ce/Zr molar ratio. Ni catalysts supported on Ce-modified mesoporous zirconia were then prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method for use in hydrogen production by auto-thermal reforming of ethanol. The effect of Ce/Zr molar ratio on the catalytic performance of supported Ni catalysts was investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of Ni catalyst supported on Ce-modified mesoporous zirconia,"2.1 Preparation of Ni catalyst supported on Ce-modified mesoporous zirconia A series of Ce-modified mesoporous zirconia were prepared by a templating sol–gel method with a variation of Ce/Zr molar ratio for use as supporting materials for Ni catalyst. A solution comprising 4g of P123 ((Ethylene Oxide)20 (Propylene Oxide)70 (Ethylene Oxide)20, BASF), 23ml of distilled water, 100ml of 2-butanol, and 1ml of hydrochloric acid (35% HCl, Samchun Chem.) was prepared at 80°C with constant stirring (Solution A, pH=3.0). Another solution composed of 12ml of zirconium butoxide (Zr(OBu)4, Sigma–Aldrich), 8ml of diethylene glycol (C4H10O3, Sigma–Aldrich), and 100ml of 2-butanol was prepared at room temperature with constant stirring (Solution B). After adding Solution B to Solution A, the resulting solution was stirred for 3h to obtain a transparent zirconia sol (to form a mesoporous structure of zirconia). Known amount of cerium nitrate (Ce(NO3)3, Kanto Chem.) dissolved in 20ml of 2-butanol was added to the prepared zirconia sol with constant stirring. The resulting sol was maintained at 100°C for 24h in a closed container to form a gel. The obtained product was washed and filtered with ethanol, and then it was dried at 80°C in a convection oven to obtain a solid. The solid product was finally calcined at 500°C for 5h to yield a Ce-modified mesoporous zirconia. The Ce-modified mesoporous zirconia with different Ce/Zr molar ratio (X) was denoted as Zr–Ce-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9). Ni catalysts supported on Zr–Ce-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) were prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method. The supported catalysts were dried at 100°C for 12h, and subsequently, they were calcined at 500°C for 5h. The prepared catalysts were denoted as Ni/Zr–Ce-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9). Ni loadings were fixed at 20wt% in all cases."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Chemical compositions of Zr–Ce-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) supports were determined by SEM-EDX (Jeol, JSM-6700F) analyses. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of supports were obtained with an ASAP-2010 instrument (Micromeritics) and pore size distributions were determined by the Barret–Joyner–Hallender (BJH) method applied to the desorption branch of the nitrogen isotherm. Crystalline phases of supports and supported catalysts were determined by XRD (MAC Science, M18XHF-SRA) measurements using Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.54056Å) operated at 50kV and 100mA. In order to check the reducibility of supports and supported catalysts, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements were carried out in a conventional flow system with a moisture trap connected to a thermal conductivity detector at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 1000°C with a ramping rate of 5°C/min. For the TPR measurements, a mixed stream of H2 (2ml/min) and N2 (20ml/min) was used for 0.2g of sample."
4,Auto-thermal reforming of ethanol,"2.3 Auto-thermal reforming of ethanol Auto-thermal reforming of ethanol was carried out in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. Each calcined catalyst (50mg) was charged into a tubular quartz reactor, and then it was reduced with a mixed stream of H2 (10ml/min) and N2 (30ml/min) at 500°C for 3h. Ethanol and water were sufficiently vaporized by passing through a pre-heating zone and continuously fed into the reactor together with N2 carrier (30ml/min). Feed ratios of H2O/EtOH and O2/EtOH were fixed at 3.0 and 0.5, respectively. Contact time was maintained at 175g-catalystmin/EtOH-mole. Catalytic reaction was carried out at 500°C. Reaction products were periodically sampled and analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (Younglin, ACME 6000) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. Ethanol conversion and product selectivity were calculated according to the following equations. Here, n represents the number of moles and χ is a stoichiometric factor (χ =2 for C1 and χ =1 for C2 compounds). (1) EtOH conversion = n EtOH , in − n EtOH , out n EtOH , in × 100 (2) H 2 selectivity = n H 2 3 ( n EtOH , in − n EtOH , out ) + ( n H 2 O , in − n H 2 O , out ) × 100 (3) C χ selectivity = n C χ χ ( n EtOH , in − n EtOH , out ) × 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Physical and chemical properties of Zr–Ce-X supports,"3.1 Physical and chemical properties of Zr–Ce-X supports Physical and chemical properties of Zr–Ce-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) supports determined by SEM-EDX, BET, and N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm measurements are summarized in Table 1 . It was found that all the prepared supports retained mesopores with an average pore diameter of 6.4–12.5nm. The measured Ce/Zr molar ratios in the Zr–Ce-X (X =0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) supports were in good agreement with the theoretical values, indicating the successful formation of Ce-modified mesoporous zirconia. All the Ce-modified mesoporous zirconia (Zr–Ce-X (X =0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9)) retained higher surface area than the mesoporous zirconia (Zr–Ce-0, ZrO2). With increasing Ce/Zr molar ratio, however, surface areas and pore volumes of Zr–Ce-X (X =0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) supports were gradually decreased. Average pore diameters of Zr–Ce-X (X =0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) supports, on the other hand, showed an increasing trend with increasing Ce/Zr molar ratio, although there is a little fluctuation as observed in the literature [32]. The addition of small amount of Ce promoted the textural stability of mesoporous zirconia, leading to high surface area and large pore volume. However, the addition of large amount of Ce led to the formation of large pore. Judging from our experimental findings, it is likely that the formation of large pore is related to the formation of solid solution caused by the incorporation of Ce4+ ion into the lattice of mesoporous zirconia, resulting in the lattice expansion and pore modification of mesoporous zirconia. This result is well supported by a previous work [33] reporting that the addition of lanthanide into alumina led to the formation of large pore of the mixed metal oxide."
7,Crystal structure of support and supported Ni catalysts,"3.2 Crystal structure of support and supported Ni catalysts Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of Zr–Ce-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) supports calcined at 500°C. Each crystalline phase was identified using JCPDS. Mesoporous ZrO2 (Zr–Ce-0) support showed the characteristic XRD peaks at 2θ=30.2, 35.2, 50.6, and 60.2, indicating the formation of tetragonal ZrO2 (JCPDS 00-050-1089). With increasing Ce/Zr molar ratio in the Zr–Ce-X (X =0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7) supports, however, major diffraction peaks of tetragonal ZrO2 shifted to lower 2θ value. This is due to the lattice expansion of Zr4+ caused by the incorporation of Ce4+ (radii of Zr4+ and Ce4+ are 0.84Å and 0.97Å, respectively). This implies the possible formation of solid solution in the Zr–Ce-X (X =0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7) supports [34–36]. In addition, XRD peak intensity and crystalline phase of Zr–Ce-X (X =0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) supports were affected by the variation of Ce/Zr molar ratio. In the Zr–Ce-0.1 support, a slight shift of diffraction peaks of tetragonal ZrO2 to lower angle was only observed without phase splitting. In the Zr–Ce-X (X =0.3, 0.5, and 0.7) supports, on the other hand, XRD peaks resulting from the formation of ZrO2–CeO2 solid solution with tetragonal Zr0.84Ce0.16O2 phase were gradually developed with increasing Ce/Zr molar ratio. In the Zr–Ce-0.9 support, however, phase splitting into the tetragonal zirconia and fluorite ceria was observed. In other words, Ce did not form a ZrO2–CeO2 solid solution but existed as crystalline CeO2 on the surface of mesoporous zirconia in the Zr–Ce-0.9 support. As mentioned earlier (Table 1), all the Zr–Ce-X (X =0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) supports showed higher surface area than the mesoporous ZrO2. However, surface areas and pore volumes of Zr–Ce-X (X =0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) supports were significantly decreased with increasing Ce/Zr molar ratio. This is due to the plugging of zirconia pores by Ce species existed on the surface [32]. This result is well consistent with a previous work [37] investigating the textural properties of CeO2-coated Al2O3. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of Ni/Zr–Ce-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) catalysts calcined and reduced at 500°C. All the calcined catalysts showed the broad XRD peaks for NiO, indicating the relatively high dispersion of NiO on the supports (Fig. 2a). All the reduced catalysts showed the XRD peaks corresponding to metallic Ni, indicating that nickel oxide was successfully reduced to metallic nickel (Fig. 2b). Crystal sizes of NiO and Ni calculated by the Scherrer equation are listed in Table 2 . Crystal sizes of Ni species in the Ni/Zr–Ce-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7) catalysts showed a decreasing trend with increasing Ce/Zr molar ratio. In the Ni/Zr–Ce-0.9 catalyst, however, crystal sizes of Ni species were slightly increased again due to the development of CeO2 crystalline. Among the reduced catalysts, Ni/Zr–Ce-0.7 showed the smallest Ni particle size."
8,TPR behavior of supports and supported Ni catalysts,"3.3 TPR behavior of supports and supported Ni catalysts TPR measurements were carried out to investigate the reducibility of supports and supported catalysts and to see the interaction between nickel and support. Fig. 3 shows the TPR profiles of Zr–Ce-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) supports and Ni/Zr–Ce-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) catalysts. As shown in Fig. 3a, Ce-free mesoporous zirconia (Zr–Ce-0, ZrO2) and Zr–Ce-0.1 supports showed no significant reduction band. In the Zr–Ce-X (X =0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) supports, however, broad reduction peaks starting from at around 400°C appeared within the range of 600–650°C. Furthermore, continuous H2 consumption was observed even after the appearance of main reduction peaks. It is interesting to note that the reduction peak position shifted to lower temperature with increasing Ce/Zr molar ratio in the Zr–Ce-X (X =0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) supports. It was reported that single-phase CeO2–ZrO2 showed a single reduction peak at around 600°C and that additional high-temperature peaks were mainly due to the presence of non-incorporated ceria or other compounds [38–40]. Continuous H2 consumption at high temperatures might cause the sample sintering during the reduction process [40]. The shift of reduction peaks of Zr–Ce-X (X =0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) supports to lower temperature with increasing Ce/Zr molar ratio can be explained by the fact that highly concentrated Ce4+ with redox feature enhances the oxygen storage capacity and oxygen mobility [41,42]. The low-temperature tailing observed in the Zr–Ce-X (X =0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) supports might be related to the reduction of CeO x species weakly interacted with zirconia. As shown in Fig. 3b, Ni/Zr–Ce-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) catalysts showed totally different TPR profiles compared to the supports. It is known that the reduction peak at around 380°C is attributed to the reduction of NiO with uniform crystal size [43]. Ni/ZrO2 catalyst showed one broad reduction peak with a shoulder, indicating the reduction of complex NiO x species interacted with ZrO2. It is noticeable that the first reduction peak temperature of Ni/Zr–Ce-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) catalysts (Fig. 3b) showed the consistent trend with the metallic nickel size of reduced Ni/Zr–Ce-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) catalysts (Table 2). In other words, the higher first reduction peak temperature of the supported catalyst corresponds to the smaller metallic Ni size of the reduced catalyst, which represents the stronger interaction between nickel and support. The appearance of second reduction peaks at high temperatures in the Ni/Zr–Ce-X (X =0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) catalysts is attributed to NiO species which are highly associated with the structure of support [36]. As reported in a previous work [44], tetragonal phase is dominant in the Ni catalyst supported on ZrO2–CeO2 solid solution with low CeO2 content, while cubic phase is mainly formed in the Ni catalyst supported on ZrO2–CeO2 solid solution with high CeO2 content. This is in good agreement with the fact that Ni/Zr–Ce-0.1 and Ni/Zr–Ce-0.3 catalysts exhibit the second reduction peaks at relatively high temperatures because NiO species associated with tetragonal phase of support are difficult to reduce. One may expect the appearance of reduction peak of bare Zr–Ce-X support during the reduction process of Ni/Zr–Ce-X catalyst. However, no noticeable reduction peak of Zr–Ce-X support was observed during the reduction of Ni/Zr–Ce-X catalyst (Fig. 3b). This is because the amount of H2 consumed for the reduction of Zr–Ce-X support, which was presented in arbitrary unit in Fig. 3a, was much smaller than that consumed for the reduction of Ni/Zr–Ce-X catalyst. In other words, the order of magnitude for H2 consumption shown in Fig. 3a is much smaller than that shown in Fig. 3b."
9,Catalytic performance of Ni/Zr–Ce-X catalysts,"3.4 Catalytic performance of Ni/Zr–Ce-X catalysts In the auto-thermal reforming of ethanol performed at 500°C, all the Ni/Zr–Ce-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) catalysts exhibited complete conversion of ethanol. However, product distributions over the catalysts were different depending on the Ce/Zr molar ratio. It has been reported that ethanol conversion in the reforming reactions over nickel catalysts reaches 100% at temperatures higher than 500°C, regardless of space velocity [45–49]. This means that the hydrogen selectivity is identical to the hydrogen yield at our reaction conditions. Therefore, the catalytic performance was evaluated in terms of hydrogen selectivity (hydrogen yield) in this work. Fig. 4 shows the hydrogen selectivity with time on stream in the auto-thermal reforming of ethanol over Ni/Zr–Ce-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) catalysts at 500°C. All the catalysts exhibited a stable catalytic performance during the reaction extending over 15h. The Ni/Zr–Ce-X (X =0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) catalysts showed higher catalytic performance than the Ni/Zr–Ce-0 (Ni/ZrO2). The catalytic performance was decreased in the order of Ni/Zr–Ce-0.7>Ni/Zr–Ce-0.5>Ni/Zr–Ce-0.3>Ni/Zr–Ce-0.1>Ni/Zr–Ce-0.9>Ni/Zr–Ce-0. The enhanced catalytic performance of Ni/Zr–Ce-X (X =0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7) compared to Ni/Zr–Ce-0 (Ni/ZrO2) is attributed to the formation of ZrO2–CeO2 solid solution with high surface area and to the enhancement of Ni dispersion. The low catalytic performance of Ni/Zr–Ce-0.9 compared to the other Ni/Zr–Ce-X catalysts is believed to be due to the presence of bulk CeO2. In general, metal high reducibility and small metal particle are favorable for the catalysis of supported metal catalyst, even though metal reducibility is suppressed and metal dispersion is increased with increasing metal-support interaction. Except for Ni/Zr–Ce-0.9 catalyst, it is interesting to note that the trend of reducibility of Ni/Zr–Ce-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7) (Fig. 3b) was opposite to that of catalytic performance of Ni/Zr–Ce-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7) (Fig. 4). On the contrary, the trend of Ni particle size of Ni/Zr–Ce-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7) (Table 2) was well consistent with that of catalytic performance of Ni/Zr–Ce-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7) (Fig. 4). In other words, a catalyst with smaller Ni particle size showed higher catalytic performance. This means that the Ni particle size (Ni dispersion) rather than the reducibility played a key role in determining the catalytic performance of Ni/Zr–Ce-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7). Fig. 5 shows the hydrogen selectivity over Ni/Zr–Ce-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) catalysts with respect to Ce/Zr molar ratio. It should be noted that the hydrogen selectivity over Ni/Zr–Ce-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) catalysts showed a volcano-shaped curve with respect to Ce/Zr molar ratio. Among the catalysts tested, Ni/Zr–Ce-0.7 showed the best catalytic performance. To elucidate the role and effect of Ce-modified mesoporous zirconia support on the catalytic performance of Ni/Zr–Ce-X, selectivities for by-products (CO, CO2, and CH4) were examined with respect to Ce/Zr molar ratio as shown in Fig. 6 . Selectivities for hydrogen and CO2 over Ni/Zr–Ce-X (X =0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) were higher than those over Ni/Zr–Ce-0 (Ni/ZrO2), and these selectivities showed the maximum values at the Ce/Zr molar ratio of 0.7. On the other hand, selectivities for CO and CH4 over Ni/Zr–Ce-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) were slightly decreased with increasing Ce/Zr molar ratio. These results suggest that Ni/Zr–Ce-X (X =0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) catalysts were favorable for water gas shift reaction (CO+H2O=CO2 +H2), CO oxidation (CO+1/2O2 →CO2), and methane steam reforming (CH4 +H2O=CO+3H2). It was reported that CeO2 in the Ni/ZrO2–CeO2 enhanced the catalytic activity in the steam reforming of ethanol due to its high oxygen storage capacity [43]. Due to the enhanced oxygen storage capacity, CeO2 in the ZrO2–CeO2 solid solution can undergo rapid oxidation–reduction cycles (Ce4+–Ce3+). In addition to the main reaction over Ni/CeO2–ZrO2 catalyst in the CH4 reforming process, it was also reported that the redox reaction between absorbed CH4 and lattice oxygen on the surface of ZrO2–CeO2 solid solution took place, which effectively prevented the carbon formation on the Ni surface [50]. In our experiments, it was observed that the selectivities for H2, CO2, and CH4 were decreased over Ni/Zr–Ce-X catalyst with high Ce content such as Ni/Zr–Ce-0.9. Although the selectivities for C2H4 and CH3CHO are not shown here, selectivity for CH3CHO over Ni/Zr–Ce-0.9 catalyst was significantly increased compared to the other Ni/Zr–Ce-X catalysts. Therefore, it can be inferred that ethanol oxidation reaction (C2H5OH+1/2O2 =CH3CHO+H2O) preferably occurred over Ni/Zr–Ce-0.9 catalyst due to the excess oxygen provided by bulk CeO2 on the catalyst surface."
10,Conclusions,"Ce-modified mesoporous zirconia (Zr–Ce-X) supports were prepared by a templating sol–gel method with a variation of Ce/Zr molar ratio (X). Ni catalysts supported on Zr–Ce-X (X =0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) were then prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method, and were applied to hydrogen production by auto-thermal reforming of ethanol. The effect of Ce/Zr molar ratio on the catalytic performance of Ni/Zr–Ce-X catalysts was investigated. All the Ni/Zr–Ce-X catalysts exhibited complete conversion of ethanol at 500°C. Hydrogen selectivity over Ni/Zr–Ce-X catalysts showed a volcano-shaped curve with respect to Ce/Zr molar ratio. Among the catalysts tested, Ni/Zr–Ce-0.7 showed the best catalytic performance. All the Ni/Zr–Ce-X (X =0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) catalysts showed higher catalytic performance than the Ni/Zr–Ce-0 (Ni/ZrO2), because oxygen storage capacity and dispersion of nickel species were enhanced by the addition of Ce. The suppressed catalytic performance of Ni/Zr–Ce-0.9 compared to Ni/Zr–Ce-X (X =0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7) was due to the excess oxygen provided by bulk CeO2 on the catalyst surface."
