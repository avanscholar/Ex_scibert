0,Introduction,"Nickel nanoparticles, in catalytic applications, have recently gained significance and they have been used for selective oxidative coupling of thiols [1], reduction of ketones [2], aldehydes [3], olefins [4], and aromatic nitro compounds [5]. general problem of metal nanoparticles is associated to their tendency to undergo agglomeration and oxidation, associate to a consequent enhancement of the particle size, and therefore, reducing the catalytic activity [6]. Two general strategies have been developed to stabilize metal nanoparticles: supporting the metal on suitable solid surfaces or by using suitable ligands. Other possibilities for the production of new nickel based catalyst can be developed stabilizing nickel nanoparticles by encapsulation in a polymer to combine the unique catalytic properties of nickel with the reaction shape-selectivity effects. Polymer-supported transition metal catalysts have attracted considerable attention over the past two decades. There are many excellent reviews [7] and monographs [8] concerning the advances and achievements in this field. In most of these works, synthetic polymers were employed as ligands for metals and just few examples have been reported on the application of natural polymers, such as chitosan, cellulose and starch [9]. It is well known that natural polymers have the advantages of cheapness, easy availability and much reduced toxicity over synthesized polymers. In addition, similarly to some enzyme promoted reactions, the tridimensional structure of the biopolymer could modulate the activity and the selectivity of the catalyst. These properties increase the interest for some natural polymers as a new kind of polymeric ligands for transition metals. In this paper, we report that nickel(0) can be entrapped in a biopolymer matrix (carboxymethyl cellulose) starting from cheap precursors (Scheme 1 ) using a simple experimental protocol, and NaBH4 as a reducing agent. The resulting selective and active hydrogenation catalyst, of aromatic nitro compounds and aliphatic as well as aromatic ketones in aqueous medium, can replace Raney nickel and other common heterogeneous catalysts such as Pt and Pd, reducing the costs and the toxic waste production with respect to catalyst that are usually employed in excess. Our method is also expected to result in the following advantages: (a) sodium carboxymethyl cellulose acts as a biodegradable polymer; (b) water can be used as a solvent; (c) and the catalyst can be easily reused for several times."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of Col-Ni-CMC Nps catalyst,"2.1 Preparation of Col-Ni-CMC Nps catalyst Col-Ni-CMC Nps catalyst was synthesized following our previously reported procedure with a slight modification [10]. Sodium borohydride (25mg) was added to aqueous solution of CMC surfactant (25mg, in 25mL H2O). The obtained solution was quickly added under vigorous magnetic stirring to NiCl2·6H2O (250mg, 1.05mmol) dissolved in H2O (25mL). The initial green solution darkened rapidly indicating the metal reduction and the formation of nickel(0) nanoparticles. In order to characterize the active phase of catalyst, we have isolated the resulting Ni nanoparticles by filtration of the obtained black suspension. The residue was washed several times with water, ethanol and acetone. Finally, the product was dried in air at 100°C for 24h."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization TEM observations were carried out at 100kV (JEOL 1200 EXII). Samples were prepared by embedding the hybrid material in AGAR 100 resin, followed by ultramicrotomy techniques and deposition on copper grids. Size of Ni crystallites was estimated by operating 50 random counts by image analysis and the mean diameter was measured by the Feret's method [11]. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were also carried out and XRD diagrams were collected in the θ–θ mode using a Philips X'Pert MPD diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation (λ=1.54178Å) at room temperature (25°C); 2θ =4–80. The samples were dried under vacuum and kept under an argon atmosphere. Particle size of Ni crystallites was calculated by using the Debye–Scherrer's equation. The contents of nickel in the catalyst were determined by a Varian 700-Es series inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). Samples were extracted in HNO3 1M solution and a 5–50mg/mL Ni standard range was employed for calibration. The NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker spectrometer (300MHz Avance) in a mixture of CDCl3. Chemical shifts are reported as δ values (ppm) relative to TMS as a standard and the coupling constants J values are given in Hz. All the spectroscopic data of the reaction products were compared with those reported in the literature and/or commercially available. The reaction mixtures were analyzed on a Trace GC Thermo Finnigan chromatograph equipped with FID detector. GC parameters for capillary column BP (25m×0.25mm, SGE): injector 250°C; detector 250°C; oven 70°C for 5min then 3°Cmin−1 until 250°C for 30min; column pressure 20kPa, column flow 6.3mLmin−1; linear velocity 53.1cms−1; and total flow 138mLmin−1. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel (30–60μm). All solvents were distilled and dried before using."
4,General procedure for hydrogenation under atmospheric hydrogen pressure,"2.3 General procedure for hydrogenation under atmospheric hydrogen pressure A 25mL round bottom flask, charged with 8mL of freshly prepared aqueous colloidal suspension of Ni-CMC catalyst (from 40mg of NiCl2·6H2O), was connected with a gas burette (500mL) and a flask to balance the pressure. The flask was closed by a septum, and the system was filled with hydrogen. The nitroarene compound ([substrate]/[metal]=100) in 2mL of MeOH, was injected through the septum and the mixture was stirred at room temperature. The reaction was monitored by the volume of gas consumed and by gas chromatography. At the end of the reaction, the residue was extracted with diethyl ether (3×25mL). The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. Pure product was obtained by column chromatography over silica gel using hexane/ethyl acetate as eluent."
5,General procedure for hydrogenation under hydrogen pressure,"2.4 General procedure for hydrogenation under hydrogen pressure The stainless steel autoclave was charged with the previously prepared aqueous suspension of Col-Ni-CMC Nps (8mL, from 40mg of NiCl2·6H2O and 10mL, from 50mg of NiCl2·6H2O) for ketone hydrogenation. The appropriate nitro-aromatic ([substrate]/[metal]=100) in 2mL of MeOH, was added into the autoclave and dihydrogen was admitted to the system at constant pressure (10 to 40bars). The mixture was stirred until the reaction was finished. Samples for gas chromatographic analysis were removed from time to time. The residue was extracted with diethyl ether (3×25mL). The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure Pure products were obtained by column chromatography over silica gel using hexane/ethyl acetate as eluent."
6,Results and discussion,"The catalytically active Ni-CMC particles were formed by supporting the obtained Ni(0) colloids prepared on sodium CMC. The preparation of the aqueous suspension in catalytic reaction conditions was optimized by establishing the amount of CMC able to support Ni colloids without provoking large aggregates. Specifically, the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene into aniline in standard conditions (20°C, 1bar H2, [substrate]/[Rh]=100) was studied with different concentrations (C g/L) of CMC (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5). A polymer concentration of 0.5g/L was sufficient to maintain stable Ni colloids. On the contrary, concentrations <0.5g/L led to precipitation after catalysis, whereas CMC concentrations >0.5g/L decreased considerably the yield of aniline. Therefore, 0.5g/L was established as the CMC concentration for the stable and reproducible synthesis of Ni nanoparticles and their use in the hydrogenation of nitrobenzenes, aliphatic and aromatic ketones under aqueous conditions. Since CMC could form complexes with divalent metal ions due to their high number of coordinating functional groups (hydroxyl groups) [9], it was likely that the majority of the nickel ions were closely associated with the CMC molecules. Therefore nucleation and initial crystal growth of Ni(0) may preferentially occur on CMC. In addition, CMC presented interesting dynamic supramolecular associations facilitated by inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonding, which could act as templates for nanoparticle growth [8]. They aggregated to pseudo-spherical Ni-CMC nanoparticles in a further step. In order to characterize the active phase of catalyst, the resulting Ni-CMC particles were recovered by filtration of the active aqueous suspension. The residue was washed several times with water, ethanol and acetone. Finally, the product was dried in air at 100°C for 24h. The XRD pattern of the Ni-CMC is shown in Fig. 1A, the Miller indices are specified above the corresponding peaks. The XRD reflections in the 40–120° 2θ interval have been assigned to the (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) crystalline planes of the typical cubic phase of metallic nickel (PDF#87-712). No impurity diffraction peak was detected, indicating that phase pure metal nickel with good crystallinity was prepared under the present experimental conditions. The nickel crystallite size was calculated from the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Bragg reflections using the Debye–Scherrer's equation corrected for the instrumental line width broadening (Table 1 ). The calculated particle diameter resulted between 75 and 90nm. After four cycles of nitrobenzene hydrogenation, XRD pattern of the isolated catalyst (Fig. 1B), shows two broad peaks at 2θ =43.5° and 62.8°, indexing (200) and (220) crystalline planes respectively, were assigned to NiO oxide (JCPDS, file no. 78-0643) and no diffraction peaks of metallic Ni were observed, indicating that metallic Ni has been converted to NiO. As expected, Ni is present at levels >95% w/w in Ni-CMC (Table 1). However, as shown in Fig. 2 , upon reaction extensive loss of Ni occurred with just around 42% Ni remaining in the polymer matrix. However, Ni is still present in large amounts as shown by EDX analysis (Fig. 3 ) and still capable of reacting. In fact, EDX on various regions of Ni-CMC before hydrogenation confirmed the presence of Ni, with energy bands centered on 7.5 and 8.3keV (K lines) and 0.8keV (L lines) (Fig. 3E). The analysis indicates a predominance of Ni over carbon and oxygen species, which come mainly from the polymer (Fig. 3, B–D). High levels of Ni were observed even after 4cycles of hydrogenation, although ICP-AES has already shown a >50% w/w loss. The reduced presence of Ni is evident looking at the lower intensity of the signals in the EDX spectrum (Fig. 3E). The loss in Ni could be explained by looking at the morphology of the samples before and after hydrogenation. As shown in Fig. 4A, the lower magnification SEM image indicates that the obtained Ni-CMC is characterized by rosebud-like polymeric particles of about 4–5μm. A detailed side view on the individual Ni-CMC particle can be observed from the higher magnification image, which clearly shows that the Ni-CMC flowers with spherical symmetry are composed of many interconnected wide nanosheets. These nanosized structures are well evident on the surface of the polymer particle and were estimated having a mean Feret's diameter of 77.5±13.5nm. These values are quite in agreement with those calculated by the Debye–Scherrer's equation and the resulting distribution is shown in Fig. 5 . The same sample observed after four hydrogenation cycles showed a drastic change in morphology with complete loss in structure of the polymer support (Fig. 4B). Also we observed pseudo-spherical particles on the surface, which can be assigned to Ni. However, as evident from Fig. 1B, Ni seems to have lost crystallinity with complete disappearance of the characteristic XRD signals in Fig. 1A. Such observations suggest a deep change of the system upon reaction, which may be the result of the drastic conditions needed to carry on the reaction. The TEM image in Fig. 6 shows that Ni-CMC nanoparticles exhibited a spherical morphology. It was observed that the Ni nanoparticles were encapsulated into CMC. The black spheres represent Ni-CMC clusters and the black spots representing Ni nanoparticles dispersed on the support. Before hydrogenation (Fig. 6A), a high concentration of Ni particles relatively dispersed on the support was observed. However, TEM morphology of the catalyst after four cycles of hydrogenation (Fig. 6B) showed agglomerated particles with the presence of smaller single particles. Even by TEM, the physical change of the matrix is well visible due to probable decomposition during the reaction. A deeper analysis of the TEM images allowed to estimate the mean Feret's diameter calculated over a population of 50 random counts (Fig. 7 ). Ni-CMC nanoparticle distribution is shown in Fig. 7A. The average diameter was 89.5±36.3nm very well correlated to that obtained by using the highest XDR signal in Fig. 1A of 88.3nm. The population clearly resulted not completely homogeneous with the presence of large clusters above 100nm. The analysis performed on the reacted sample instead highlighted the presence of smaller particles and an average diameter of 29.8±20.9nm (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that fragmentation occurred to the Ni crystallites observed initially during the reaction and the extensive loss measured may be due to the leakage of Ni from the matrix that contemporarily underwent possible chemical degradation. This may also partly explain the loss of crystallinity of the system. The hypothesis about CMC degradation lays on a possible oxidation linked to the high content of oxygen of the CMC polymer. In fact, in Fig. 3E, beyond Ni reduction, the EDX spectra show an increase in the intensity of the oxygen signal at 0.5keV, which may be correlated with the presence of a large amount of oxidized species confirmed by XRD analysis (Fig. 1B), which shows an oxidized phase of Ni (NiO) with no diffraction peaks of metallic Ni."
7,Evaluation of the catalytic activity of Ni-CMC,"3.1 Evaluation of the catalytic activity of Ni-CMC Aromatic amines are important starting materials and intermediates in the synthesis of a variety of pharmaceutical products, agricultural chemicals, dyestuff and polymers [12]. Their preparation using catalytic reduction of aromatic nitro compounds has been object of a number of studies [13–15]. Among them, metal/hydride complexes [16], homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic transfer hydrogenations [17,18] have been reported. Good results were observed with nickel catalysts [18–22] in direct hydrogenation reactions, described as an alternative green process for the preparation of p-aminophenol and its derivatives [23]. To evaluate the catalytic performance of the Col-Ni-CMC Nps, we have studied the hydrogenation of a number of functionalized nitrobenzenes to the corresponding anilines. The reaction conditions (pressure and solvent) were preliminarily optimized using nitrobenzene 1a as model substrate and the results are summarized in Table 2 . In fact, under atmospheric pressure, we have observed that the hydrogenation of 1a takes 48h to carry out with moderate conversion (63% of 2a) (Table 2, entry 1). A combination of water and alcohol as solvent has a good effect on the activity of the catalyst. The best results were obtained using a mixture of water/isopropanol or water/methanol (Table 2, entries 4 and 5 respectively). Higher hydrogen pressure showed a favorable effect and reduces the reaction time considerably (Table 2, entries 6–8). In all the cases, the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene afforded aniline 2a as the only product (Table 2). With the optimized conditions on hand, Ni-CMC Nps catalyzed hydrogenation of functionalized nitrobenzenes 1b–i were investigated obtaining the corresponding aromatic amines 2b–i in good to excellent yields (79–98%). As shown in Table 3 , all the reactions were completed within 8–36h at room temperature under 40bars hydrogen pressure. This investigation showed that the catalytic activity is strongly dependent on the nature of the functional group. Particularly, a kinetic decrease with CO2Me (3-nitrobenzoic acid methyl ester), OH (3-nitrophenol and 2-nitrophenol), NH2 (4-nitrophenylamine and 2-nitrophenylamine) (Table 3, entries 11, 13, 14 and 15 respectively) was observed. The best result was obtained with 1-methyl-4-nitrobenzene 1b affording 2b in 8h and 98% of yield. The proposed catalyst proved to be efficient in terms of chemoselectivity through the reduction of nitro group even in the presence of other functionality. All the yields are referred to the amount of isolated products after purification and the structures were confirmed by comparison of the spectroscopic data with those reported in literature [18–22]. We also studied the possibility of reutilization of the Col-Ni-CMC Nps using nitrobenzene as a substrate. For each cycle, the Col-Ni-CMC Nps were decanted and the supernatant was removed, followed by the addition of more substrate. In the same conditions (S/C=100, solvent: H2O/MeOH (8/2), PH2: 40bars, room temperature), the yields of aniline obtained from hydrogenation of nitrobenzene after 12h, were 99%, 83%, 76% and 66%, for first run, second run, third run and fourth run respectively. A decrease in activity was observed for the third and fourth runs albeit the yields were still reasonably good. At any rate, no byproducts arose in these experiments. In order to understand the cause of the decline in activity, we subjected the catalyst (isolated by filtration) after fourth runs to ICP-AES analysis (Fig. 4). The analysis confirms that the catalyst was subjected to leaching during the hydrogenation. Only 42% of Ni was retained in the catalyst. In addition, the XRD spectrum shows two broad peaks corresponding to the nickel oxide (NiO) resulting from oxidation of metallic nickel in the reaction medium. However, the satisfactory yields of hydrogenation after the third and fourth runs could be explained by the involvement of NiO as catalyst in hydrogenation. In fact Farhadi et al. [24] have prepared and used NiO nanoparticles as efficient and selective heterogeneous catalyst for the reduction of nitroarenes into their corresponding amines. We continued our investigation in the aim to uncover another significant catalytic activity of Ni-CMC Nps for ecofriendly hydrogenation of ketones in aqueous media. Catalytic hydrogenation of aromatic ketones to afford benzyl alcohols represents a useful strategy in the preparation of fine chemicals and drugs [25]. Selective hydrogenation of ketones can be achieved with homogeneous catalyst. For example a cetophenone can be selectively converted into 1-phenylethanol using a number of procedures recently summarized in some publications [26,27]. A number of reducing agents are nowadays available: nickel Raney [28], Ni-MCM-41 [29], Cu/Ru complexes [30], and HCOONa/ΔPressure [31]. The use of toxic solvents, long reaction times associated to a large production of wastes and low yields represents the major drawback of all these methodologies. In contrast heterogeneous catalysts can provide useful strategies and are usually characterized by high catalyst turnover and recyclability and, consequently, ecofriendly process. A number of studies have been reported for the hydrogenation of acetophenone using heterogeneous Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ru based catalysts. These reactions can be carried out under liquid- or gas-phase conditions [32–35] and present easy work up, short reaction times and good yields. A number of aryl and alkyl ketones were hydrogenated using Ni-CMC as catalyst. All the reactions were done in water, at room temperature and under hydrogen pressure (40bars). The results, summarized in Table 4 , underline the high performance of the catalyst. All the yields are referred to the amount of the isolated products (4a–j) after purification. Starting from acetophenone and similar derivatives (3a, 3c–e), the reaction resulted to be quantitative in 24h and there is no appreciable influence on the steric hindrance on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group. Longer reaction time is required in the presence of slightly electron-donating substituents (3b, 36h) as well as a methoxy group in ortho position (3f, 72h) or a chlorine in para position (3g, 72h). Good yields and shorter reaction time were observed in the case of the aliphatic ketone (3i). With ketolactone derivatives (3j), the reduction occurred chemio-selectively on the keto group. Interestingly also benzophenone (3h) can be efficiently reduced to the corresponding alcohol and no side product derived by over-reduction was observed. The catalyst was recovered for successive hydrogenations of acetophenone showing an appreciable catalytic activity (Table 5 ). The yields of corresponding alcohol after 24h were still reasonably good after fourth run despite a leaching of the catalyst. These results showed that the catalyst can be reused for four cycles."
8,Conclusion,"In conclusion, nickel nanoparticles stabilized with sodium carboxy-methyl cellulose (Ni-CMC) were prepared with average diameter of 89.5±36.3nm. As a stabilizing agent of nanoparticles, CMC played a very important role on the preparation of Ni-CMC composite. Col-Ni-CMC nanoparticles proved to be efficient catalyst for the hydrogenation of functionalized nitrobenzenes and ketones to anilines and alcohols respectively. The reaction was conducted in aqueous medium at room temperature under pressure of H2 (1 to 40bars). The Ni Nps capped by sodium carboxy-methyl cellulose are stable during the hydrogenation process. The catalytic activity increased with increasing pressure of H2. Moreover, the Col-Ni-CMC Nps could be re-used at least four times, maintaining relatively good activity. In the current state of this study, however, we note problem of loss of activity after several cycles caused by leaching of the catalyst."
