0,Introduction,"A gas-expanded liquid (GXL) is a novel liquid solution in which the volume of a solvent (typically an organic liquid) is expanded through the addition of a significant mole fraction of gas at high, but subcritical pressures [1]. Over the past two decades, GXLs have drawn great attention as support media in catalysis and separations, due to many factors, including enhanced mass transport, ease of post processing, high reactant and catalyst solubility and a reduction of amount of organic solvent needed [2,3]. Although most GXL studies and applications to date utilize carbon dioxide as the expansion gas (to form so-called “carbon dioxide-expanded liquids” or CXLs), efforts have been expanded to other expansion gases, such as propane [4], propylene [5], and ethylene [6]. In a recently proposed heterogeneous catalytic process for the epoxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide in niobium-doped silica nanopores, the reactant, ethylene, is used as an expansion gas with the aim of enhancing the reactant concentration in liquid phase [7–9]. Ethylene oxide is widely used in production of ethylene carbonate, which is the major component of electrolyte in commercial lithium-ion batteries. Specifically, the reaction mixture is an ethylene-expanded liquid (EXL) consisting of methanol (solvent), hydrogen peroxide (oxidant), water and the expansion gas, ethylene (reactant). Water is included here because the hydrogen peroxide used in the process is generally supplied as a solution with water. The use of ethylene as the expansion gas allows its concentration in the liquid phase to be easily tuned by adjusting the gas-phase pressure. The optimization of this catalytic process is hindered by the lack of reliable data on the Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE) for this quaternary system - especially with regard to the solubility of ethylene as a function of hydrogen peroxide/water content. Determining the VLE of a quaternary system is challenging, both experimentally and in simulation. However, modern molecular simulation tools, such as Gibbs Ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC), are well suited to the prediction of VLE, given a model for the intermolecular forces, while Molecular Dynamics simulation can be used to estimate the structural and thermodynamic properties of the calculated coexisting phases [10]. Previous simulations on GXLs using existing interaction models from the literature have been shown to give excellent agreement with experimental measurements for a variety of systems, especially CXLs [11,12]. In previous work we have examined the related binary EXL system (ethylene/methanol) (both in bulk [13] and under confinement in silica nanopores [14]), as well as the ternary EXL system where water is added to the ethylene/methanol mixture [15]. In these EXL studies, we obtained very good agreement with VLE experiments on these systems, exceeding the accuracy of standard equation of state modeling. In the binary [13] and ternary [15] EXL systems, we observed that decreasing temperature or increasing pressure not only increases the solubility of ethylene in the liquid, but also enhances diffusivity of all component species - a major advantage in process applications. In the ternary system, however, increased water content significantly lowered the ethylene solubility. In this work, we extend our earlier calculations to the full quaternary reaction mixture (ethylene/methanol/water/hydrogen peroxide) for the aforementioned ethylene epoxidation reaction. As in our previous work on binary and ternary EXLs, we calculate the volume expansion as functions of temperature and pressure, while also varying the relative amounts of methanol and water/hydrogen peroxide. In addition, the compositional quaternary vapor-liquid phase equilibrium is studied and compared with our earlier results on the methane/ethylene/water ternary system. Finally we examine the local liquid structure as functions of temperature pressure and composition."
1,Methods,"In this work, we use a United Atom (UA) model for methanol and ethylene in which the carbon atoms and those hydrogen atoms bonded to it are collapsed into a single “pseudoatom” sphere. While including all atoms in the simulation would yield perhaps a more realistic model, the computation of the additional interaction energies increases the computation time by an order of magnitude. Given the computational advantages, which are especially important for complex multicomponent phase equilibrium, and the observations that such UA models have been shown to give excellent results for phase equilibrium in similar systems [13,15], the UA force field is suitable for purposes of this work. For ethylene we use a quadrupolar forcefield due to Weitz et al. [16], and, for methanol, the Transferable Potentials for Phase Equilibria-United Atom (TraPPE-UA) force field [17] with the C–O–H bond angle fixed to 108.5°. For water we use the SPC/E model [18]. All three species are treated as rigid molecules. For hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) we use a model by Cordeiro [19] with parameters for bonds, angles and torsions adapted from Koput et al. [20]. The short-range interactions as well as charges in this potential have been optimized to match liquid properties and the experimental free energy of hydration. Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rules are used for all short-range cross interactions and Ewald sums are used for the electrostatic interactions. The cutoff for all short-range interactions is chosen as 1.4 nm and Ewald Sum accuracy is 10−5. In each NPT-GEMC simulation the vapor and liquid simulation boxes contain between 700 and 1000 molecules in total. Initially, the majority of ethylene molecules are placed in the vapor box with the other species placed in the liquid simulation box. Between 250 K and 1 M Monte Carlo (MC) cycles (cycles = number of steps/number of molecules), depending upon the system conditions, were used to equilibrate the systems. During equilibration, the maximum MC displacements for translational, rotational, torsional and volume moves are adjusted to achieve a 50% acceptance rate. After this initial equilibration, the system is advanced for another 250 K cycles with fixed maximum displacements, followed by a 1 M cycle production run for the calculation of compositions and physical properties. These 1 M cycles are divided into 10 blocks for error estimation, using block-averaging and the Student's t-distribution with a 95% confidence level. To be consistent with the experimental conditions for all studied quaternary mixtures, the H2O/H2O2 mass ratio is fixed to 1:1. Systems with 6 different initial compositions at various temperatures (20°C and 40°C) and pressures (5 bar, 30 bar and 50 bar) were analyzed. All NPT-GEMC simulations are carried out using the parallel MC program CASSANDRA [21]. Because the Ryckaert-Bellemans type function for dihedral angle energy, used in original hydrogen peroxide model [19], is not supported in CASSANDRA, the function is converted to an alternative OPLS type function and the fifth-order term is neglected. To validate this approximation, we have calculated dihedral energy differences at 36 evenly distributed positions between 0 and π and a Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) is found to be 0.0055 kcal/mol, which is acceptable. The volume expansion is quantified by the Volume Expansion Ratio, defined as the ratio between the volume of gas-expanded liquid and the volume of neat solvent at the same temperature and 1 atm pressure. To be consistent with previous studies, the specific volume of the liquid phase is determined from NPT MD simulations. For each liquid phase a cubic simulation cell with initial edge length of 5 nm is created using phase composition predicted from the NPT-GEMC simulations. The simulation cell for the corresponding neat solvent is generated by simply removing ethylene from that of the quaternary system. The same force field parameters as in NPT-GEMC simulations are employed. The long range interaction is calculated using PPPM [22] with an accuracy of 10−6. The simulation cell is equilibrated at 100 K for 50 ps, then heated to the target temperature for another 100 ps. After 1 ns of equilibration, a 2 ns production simulation is performed to calculate densities and radial distribution functions (RDFs). In the whole procedure NVT ensemble is employed through Nosé-Hoover thermostat [23,24] with damping factor as 100 fs. The timestep is chosen to 1 fs and snapshots are collected every 100 steps. All MD simulations are conducted using LAMMPS [25]. Four-phase (quaternary) equilibrium is often difficult to visualize given the large number of components. To simplify this we note that, relative to ethylene, the liquid components methanol, water and hydrogen peroxide are nonvolatile; the equilibrium vapor phase will consist almost exclusively of ethylene. Therefore, as the pressure of ethylene over a given solution of methanol, water and hydrogen peroxide is increased at constant pressure and temperature, the relative fractions of methanol, water and hydrogen peroxide change relatively little. In addition, we fix the water and hydrogen peroxide ratio to 1. As such, in analogy to our previous study on ethylene-expanded methanol/water mixtures [15], we define for each solution a “solvent” methanol mole fraction (1) x meth s = n meth / ( n meth + n water + n H 2 O 2 ) as the ratio of the number of moles of methanol to the total number of moles of the other relatively non-volatile liquid components. Using this quantity, we will be able to quantify how properties such as the volume expansion or ethylene solubility change with varying ratios of methanol to H2O/H2O2."
2,Results,
3,Liquid-phase composition (Ethylene solubility),"3.1 Liquid-phase composition (Ethylene solubility) The vapor phase for this system over all conditions studied is nearly pure ethylene (99+%) and uninteresting. Therefore, we focus primarily on the liquid-phase composition - especially because this phase is more relevant for applications in catalysis. The liquid phase composition is determined here by calculating the ethylene solubility ( x ethy ) as a function of the solvent methanol mole fraction x meth s (as defined in the previous section) for various temperatures and pressures. The top panel of Fig. 1 shows the variation of x ethy as a function of x meth s at several different pressures (5, 30 and 50 bar), but with fixed temperature (20°C). In general, the ethylene solubility increases with increasing methanol content, as expected from “like dissolves like” solubility considerations. In addition, whereas the solubility of ethylene in the binary H2O/H2O2 mixture ( x meth s = 0 ) is negligible at all pressures, it does show considerable increase with increasing pressure for higher methanol loadings - up to about 12% at 50 bar and x meth s = 0.8 . At 50 bar this represents an increase by about a factor of 10 from the highest to the lowest pressures studied. The bottom panel of Fig. 1 shows the ethylene solubility as a function of x meth s for two temperatures (20°C and 40°C) at a fixed pressure of 30 bar. Over this temperature range, the variation in solubility is small - with an enhancement of between 8 and 22% depending upon the range of pressure - contrasted with the up to 1000% enhancement due to pressure variation. From this data, we observe that increasing the ethylene solubility can be better achieved by pressure tuning, as opposed to temperature variation. One implication of this study to the ethylene epoxidation reaction described in the introduction is that careful tuning is necessary to determine the optimum operating conditions, as the concentration of the reactant species ethylene varies inversely with the concentration of the oxidant species, hydrogen peroxide. For example, Fig. 2 shows the molar ratio between ethylene and hydrogen peroxide as a function of x meth s at different pressures and 20°C. At high methanol compositions ( x meth s = 0.80) this ratio can be tuned from nearly zero to 2 by adjusting the pressure up to 50 bar. In contrast, at lower methanol loadings ( x meth s = 0.11), the molar ratio is very low ( < 0.025 ) at all pressures. Therefore, detailed studies of the reaction kinetics with respect to each reactant would be necessary to optimize the operating conditions using the data presented here. In Fig. 3 , we compare the ethylene solubility for the current quaternary system with that of the ethylene/methanol/water ternary system [15]. For the ternary system, the solvent methanol mole fraction is defined as (2) x meth s = n meth n meth + n water By plotting the ethylene mole fraction versus x meth s for both the quaternary and ternary systems on the same graph, we are examining the degree to which hydrogen peroxide behaves differently than water in determining the liquid composition. That is, the ternary system with which we compare is one in which the hydrogen peroxide in the quaternary system has been replaced by water. Except at the very lowest methanol loadings, the ethylene solubility in the quaternary solution is identical to that of the ternary one for all pressures and temperatures studied. This is a major finding of this work. At moderate to high methanol loadings, the system, for the purposes of phase equilibrium, can be treated as a much simpler ternary system - replacing the hydrogen peroxide with an equivalent amount of water. This greatly simplifies the phase equilibrium analysis for such systems. At low methanol loadings ( x meth s < 0.3 ) where the ethylene solubility is low, the quaternary system shows slightly larger ethylene solubility than corresponding ternary. The reason for this, as we will see in the liquid structure analysis in the next section, is that hydrogen peroxide appears to have a slightly stronger affinity to ethylene than is seen for water."
4,Volume expansion ratio,"3.2 Volume expansion ratio The major experimentally measured property of GXLs is the Volume Expansion Ratio (VER), defined in Section 2. In the top panel of Fig. 4 , we plot the VER at 20°C for three different pressures as a function of the solvent methanol mole fraction x meth s , defined in Section 2. For fixed x meth s the VER increases with increasing vapor phase pressure, as expected. At all pressures, the VER is a strongly increasing function of x meth s , with nearly negligible volume expansion for x meth s < 0.3 . In addition, the maximum VER at the highest pressure (50 bar) is still quite limited - topping out at a ratio of 1.25. This is very similar to what is observed in previous methanol/ethylene/water ternary system [15], that is, when water and hydrogen peroxide are present in the liquid phase, the expansion ratio decreases dramatically compared with that in methanol/ethylene binary system under similar conditions [13]. (For comparison, the VER for the methanol/ethylene binary at the same temperature and pressure is about 1.6.) From the quaternary systems, we find that the expansion ratio shows a near linear relationship with respect to ethylene composition (Fig. 5 ). Therefore, in practice, the VER can be used as proxy for the ethylene solubility."
5,Local liquid structure,"3.3 Local liquid structure Analysis of the local liquid structure can be useful in understanding the molecular origin of solution properties, such as phase equilibria. Liquid structure is typically quantified by determining the radial distribution function (RDF) between atomic sites in each component species. The height of the first peak of these RDFs can be used as a rough measure of the “affinity” between the two selected sites. For this study, we examine the RDFs at 20°C and 50 bar, as the only qualitative differences are due to composition changes. Fig. 6 shows various RDFs between atomic sites involved in hydrogen bonding: (a) water and hydrogen peroxide, (b) water and methanol, (c) methanol with itself, and (d) hydrogen peroxide with methanol at various x meth s . Of the atom pairs shown, the affinity between water and hydrogen peroxide is the highest, as expected due to the strong hydrogen bonding between the pair - water-water (not shown) is of course the strongest interaction. For methanol the strongest affinity is with water, followed by methanol itself. The methanol-hydrogen peroxide bonding is the weakest of the interactions shown. As the methanol content in liquid increases, the affinities between all hydrogen-bonding atom pairs increase rapidly. This phenomenon was also seen in the ternary system [15]. The cause of this strengthening of the hydrogen-bonds is the increase in ethylene composition that accompanies the methanol fraction increase (see Fig. 1), and is an example of the general principle that the associate between “like” molecules (hydrophobic or hydrophilic) increases with increasing composition of “unlike” species. Of particular note in Fig. 6 is the observation that the association between the methanol hydrogen and the oxygen in hydrogen peroxide is weaker than that between methanol itself and that between methanol and water. This is consistent with the observation that, at low methanol mole fractions, the solubility of ethylene is higher in the quaternary system than in the water/methanol/ethylene ternary (See Fig. 3). As the methanol mole fraction increases and the influence of the cross molecular interactions lessens, the difference between the ethylene solubilities of the quaternary and ternary systems become negligible. Fig. 7 shows the RDFs between selected atomic sites and the center of mass (COM) of ethylene. For the RDFs between the ethylene COM and the oxygen in hydrogen peroxide, water and methanol, the height of the first peak decreases with increasing methanol content (and corresponding increase in ethylene solubility). The behavior of the ethylene-ethylene RDF shown in Fig. 7(d) is more complicated. As the methanol content is increased from its lowest level, the height of the first peak initially increases, but then begins to decrease once x meth s reaches 0.49. This stands in contrast to the observation in the ternary system [15] that the height of the first peak of the ethylene-ethylene RDF increases monotonically with increasing x meth s (at least up to 0.6). To further examine the origin of the observation that the solubilities of ethylene ( x ethy ) in the quaternary and ternary systems are nearly identical when x meth s is above 0.5, but diverge with decreasing of x meth s below this point, we compare selected RDFs from quaternary and ternary systems. As shown in Fig. 8 (a), at a similar x meth s , the RDFs between the oxygen in methanol and its hydrogen are nearly identical in the two systems (ternary and quaternary). In Fig. 8(b), we examine the interaction between the methanol oxygen and the hydrogens in water for the ternary system and between the methanol oxygen and the combined H2O/H2O2 hydrogens in the quaternary. From this we see that the first solvation shells for these RDFs (the peak associated with hydrogen bonding) are nearly identical between the quaternary and ternary systems, but some differences are seen in the second solvation shell. These observations, combined with the fact that, in the quaternary, the RDFs between the ethylene COM and both water and hydrogen peroxide oxygens (Fig. 7) are relatively weak and quite similar to each other and to the ethylene COM/water oxygen RDF in the ternary [15]. The similarities in the RDFs between the quaternary and ternary help to explain the observation that (at least at higher x meth s ) the ethylene solubilities do not change significantly when water is replaced with hydrogen peroxide."
6,Conclusion,"In this work, we study, using Monte Carlo and molecular-dynamics simulation, the phase equilibrium and structure of a four-component (quaternary) ethylene-expanded liquid (EXL) in which a mixture of methanol, water and hydrogen peroxide is expanded by ethylene. The volume expansion, phase composition and local liquid structure for this solution at different temperatures (20 and 40°C) and pressures (5, 30 and 50 bar) are reported. It is found that with increasing of methanol content in liquid, the ethylene composition significantly increases. The ethylene solubility in this solution can be also enhanced by either increasing the pressure or by decreasing the temperature - consistent with previous results for the methanol/ethylene/water ternary system [15]. A similar trend appears in its volume expansion ratio with respect to methanol content, although overall the volume expansion is much lower than ethylene/methanol binary system [13]. We also observe that the ethylene solubility in the quaternary is (for solvent methanol mole fractions greater than 0.3) nearly identical to that for the ethylene/methanol/water ternary - this allows for a significant simplification of the phase equilibrium calculations for this system in that, for the purpose of determining ethylene solubility, the hydrogen peroxide component can be assumed to function nearly identically with water and calculations can be done using the simple ternary system. Information from the liquid structure, in the form of site-site radial distribution functions (RDFs), is shown to be useful in understanding the phase equilibrium from a molecular view. This EXL has been used in a proposed process for the catalytic epoxidation of ethylene with hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. This study will be valuable in guiding the tuning of the ethylene solubility in the reaction mixture, through changes in pressure, temperature and methanol content. This information is useful in optimizing operating conditions for this catalysis [7–9]."
