0,Introduction,"In the view of the increasing energy demand, linked to the growing world population and increasing standard of living, wide greenhouse gas emission and exhaustion of non-renewable resources, the search for alternative energy sources is obligatory [1]. Several types of alternative energies can be considered, both originated by harnessing a natural process or by mechanical means, such as bioenergy derived from biomass. Despite their great potential, the advantages of using these ""green"" energy sources, come with several drawbacks related to their intrinsic dependency on day-night intervals, seasons and fluctuating environmental conditions that result in periods of deficit and surplus of energy output [2,3]. These shortcomings together with the expensive production and use, make the consumption of renewable energy minority as compared to primary energy sources from carbon-containing fuels, such as oil, coal and gas. The distribution of the total world primary energy supply (in approximate percentage) is shown in Fig. 1 . In this context, hydrogen, the simplest element on the Earth, holds enormous potential as an energy carrier in a future renewable and pollutant-free energy scenario because of its very long-term availability and possible virtual worldwide production [5], thus overcoming the economic and political conflict associated to the uneven distribution of resources. Not only hydrogen is a supreme option to replace fossil fuels because of its availability and CO2-free energy supply cycle, but also because it can be used directly as a transportation fuel and it has a high energy per mass content of 143 MJ kg−1, which is much larger than those of the common fuels [6]. Table 1 lists the energy densities of some of the most common fuels. Some other attractive features of hydrogen as a transportation fuel are its no toxicity or ozone-forming potential, rapid burning speed, high effective octane number, and wider limits of flammability in air than methane and gasoline (4–75%, 5.3–15% and 1–7.6% by volume, respectively) [7]. Nevertheless, the theoretical ideality of hydrogen as an ultimate green fuel is overshadowed by drawbacks such as the high cost of its production, storage and delivery, non-mature development of the hydrogen technologies, as well as social acceptance barriers, which eventually make the widespread establishment of the hydrogen economy inconceivable in the foreseeable future. As for hydrogen generation, even though hydrogen can be produced from various resources, both renewable (solar, hydro, wind, geothermal, biomass) and non-renewable (nuclear, coal, natural gas), steam methane reforming of natural gas is nowadays the primary path. However, this option does not fulfill the requirement of a sustainable energy cycle because it does not eliminate carbon emission [8]. In terms of storage, high-pressure gas containers and cryogenically cooled (liquefied) fluid hydrogen are currently the most used physical storage method, but the public acceptability related to the use of pressurized and liquid hydrogen, as well as the energy needed to compress and liquefy the gas (up to 20 and 40% of the hydrogen energy content, respectively) have motivated the search for alternative storage options and finding a suitable on-board hydrogen storage system able to meet the US Department of Energy´s (DOE) criteria (hydrogen capacity of 5.5 wt% and 40 g L−1 in 2020) is still a challenging task [9]. The chemical storage of hydrogen in solid or liquid molecules is being vastly investigated as a promising option to replace the physical hydrogen storage and, despite the important breakthroughs achieved in the last decade, much more research should be conducted so that the chemical storage pathway can create a real alternative [10]. Some representative hydrogen storage molecules are listed in Table 2 . The great potential of such chemical storage approach in the generation of molecular hydrogen via catalytic reactions has merited countless investigations, being of particular interest those studies reporting the use of heterogeneous catalysts, which present advantages from the practical application viewpoint [41]. Nevertheless, such heterogeneous catalysts also display severe shortcomings that greatly limit their utility and that are mainly associated with activity decay issues related to changes in the properties of the nanoparticles (NPs) under the experimental condition used in a certain reaction (high temperature, basic or acidic reaction medium, etc.) and/or leaching. It has been reported that the functionalization of the supports with various heteroatoms (i.e. N, P, B, S, O) in specific functional groups is an outstanding alternative to stabilize the loaded metal NPs and circumvent the poor stability issue by favoring strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) [42–45]. This approach has been widely explored in the case of carbon materials, which combined with their exceptional properties, such as thermal stability, exceptional electrical conductivity, surface resistance to both acid and basic medium, controllable pore structure, cost-effectiveness, etc., provides unlimited possibilities towards the design of carbon-based heterogeneous catalysts. Surface-modified carbon materials constitute an ideal platform to control the NPs features, in terms of size, dispersion, electronic properties, encapsulation processes, etc., that ultimately impact the final catalytic ability in a particular application. Fig. 2 illustrates a schematic model of functional groups on the surface of a nanostructured carbon along with the metal-carbon support interactions [46]. Among doping heteroatoms, nitrogen is the most fruitfully investigated because of its similar electronegativity and electron affinity to carbon [47] and, despite the fact that its importance in catalysts dates back from 1926, when Rideal and Wright reported the promoting role of nitrogen in the catalytic performance of charcoal in the oxalic acid oxidation [48], the importance of nitrogen-doped (N-doped) carbon in heterogeneous catalysis is still in the spotlight, as reflected in the exponentially growing number of publications per year during the last decade [49]. As for metal-N-doped carbon systems, their investigation has been classically linked to electrochemical applications, since Jasinski et al. reported on the use of phthalocyanines as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction in 1964 [50], and interesting reviews on such applications can be found in the literature [51–54]. However, their implementation in other catalytic reactions of industrial and environmental importance, such as catalytic oxidations and reductions, Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, hydrogen generation, etc., is gaining increasing interest [55]. In this review, some of the synthetic approaches for the preparation of N-doped carbon materials and related metal-based catalysts are summarized along with the most recent breakthroughs achieved by these catalysts in the hydrogen production from some of the most investigated hydrogen carrier molecules."
1,A brief description of the synthetic approach for the preparation of N-doped carbon materials and related metal-based catalysts,"Over the last decades, N-doped carbons have become one of the most promising materials used in energy applications, such as fuel cells, batteries or electrochemical capacitors [53,56]. In recent times, N-containing carbons have also gained the researchers’ attention in the field of catalytic applications [57–60]. The doping of carbons with nitrogen has been developed throughout the years and the types of nitrogen functionalities, as well as synthetic routes, are well-known nowadays. The most common nitrogen groups present in N-doped carbon materials are pyrrolic, pyridinic and graphitic or quaternary [53,61]. Additionally, more oxidized nitrogen and amine groups can be generated at the edges of the graphene layers (See Fig. 3 ). Pyrrolic nitrogen groups are bonded to two carbon atoms of the graphene layer as a member of a pentagon. Pyridinic nitrogen groups have sp2 hybridization, so their bonds include two carbon atoms as members of a hexagon, contributing one p electron per bond to the π-system and affording strong binding strength with various metals and molecules [62]. Both pyrrolic and pyridinic nitrogen groups can be located at the edge of graphitic layers or in vacancies within the layers. Graphitic nitrogen groups substitute carbon atoms, are bonded to three carbons and have sp2 hybridization. Two different configurations are possible for such functionalities, i.e. ""valley"" (near the layer end) and ""center"" (inside of the layer). These nitrogen groups possess different electronic states, so their relative contribution to the total nitrogen content existing in the material can be usually determined by deconvolution of the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) N1s spectra. Other techniques such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy or X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) have also been used to determine nitrogen configurations in the carbon network [63–67]. The determination of nitrogen configuration is important because, as it will be discussed in the next section, a particular nitrogen group may endow the final catalyst with specific properties for a certain reaction. Regarding synthetic routes to prepare N-doped carbons, it is difficult to establish a clear classification because there are a wide variety of methods. However, taking into account whether the nitrogen precursor is heat-treated together with a pre-synthesized carbon material or if carbon precursor and nitrogen-containing source are thermally treated at the same time to get the N-doped carbon material, they can be divided into two main categories: post-synthesis doping strategies and in-situ doping methods (summarized in Scheme 1 )."
2,Post-synthesis doping methods,"2.1 Post-synthesis doping methods The post-synthesis doping strategies consist of direct reaction between a pre-synthesized carbon material and N-containing sources, such as urea, ammonia, dicyandiamide, dimethylformamide (DMF), melamine, and so on [68–73]. These methods usually involve high temperatures, longer reaction time and the addition of transition metals or pretreatment of the carbon surface to facilitate the incorporation of nitrogen into the carbon network. Despite these drawbacks, the simplicity of post-synthesis doping routes to prepare N-doped carbons is the reason why they are still being used. In this approach, the nitrogen content and configuration depend on the temperature and time of the thermal treatment. As a general rule, the nitrogen content drops as temperature rises. However, it is a difficult task to establish the optimal temperature to obtain the maximum nitrogen content because the N-containing source and initial non-modified carbon material also play a pivotal role in the total content and the nitrogen configuration [74,75]. According to some studies, temperatures around 500–600 °C could be selected as an optimal interval to reach the highest nitrogen content for N-doped carbon material using NH3 as a nitrogen precursor [47,76,77]. However, some authors have also reported the synthesis of N-doped carbon materials in which they found the highest nitrogen content at temperatures over 900 °C [78–80]. Regarding the nitrogen configuration using NH3 as a precursor, Lai et al. reported that resulting N-doped graphene mainly showed pyridinic groups under 600 °C and pyridinic/graphitic groups at temperatures above 800 °C [74]. Urea is another common N-containing precursor source, because of its low cost, environmental advantages and low pyrolysis temperature among others [81,82]. Another interesting strategy to get N-functionalized carbon materials is the microwave-assisted (MW) carbonization, which is an efficient approach that requires short reaction time and is eco-friendly [52,83,84]. Yang et al. reported the synthesis of N-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-RGO) from urea by heat-treatment using MW, leading to N-RGO with pyridinic, pyrrolic and graphitic nitrogen groups. It was observed that the concentration of the latter ones depended on the reaction time [85]. MW strategy was also used to produce N-doped GO from graphite, leading to GO with a high surface area and high nitrogen content (8–11 at%) [86]. Post-synthesis doping strategies also include the functionalization of carbon materials by N-containing precursors that were previously deposited onto the carbon surface and subsequently carbonized [61,87]. Long et al. prepared N-doped graphene sheets (NG) by hydrothermal reduction of GO with a nitrogen content of 5% using hydrazine and ammonia at temperatures below 200 °C [88]. N-containing monomers have also been used to introduce nitrogen into the carbon network. N-doped carbon fibers were synthesized by chemical polymerization of aniline and subsequent carbonization [61]. It was found that the resulting nitrogen groups were clearly related to the carbonization temperature, showing that pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen groups are the most stable at temperatures above 700 °C. Pyrrole is another interesting N-containing monomer because its two nitrogen atoms per monomer could lead to N-doped carbons with high nitrogen contents. Chen et al. used pyrrole to synthesize N-doped carbon nanofibers (N-CNF) with nitrogen contents ranging from 4 to 12% and it was observed that the nitrogen groups enhanced the CNF performance in electrochemical applications [87]. Such nitrogen groups were mainly graphitic and pyridinic groups that were originated from the progressive conversion of pyrrolic groups as the carbonization temperature increased over 700 °C. Other attractive strategies for the nitrogen functionalization are the well-established organic routes. For instance, the Tour protocol, which consists of using aryldiazonium salts (such as 4-aminopyridine, 9-aminoacridine or 3-aminocarbazole) under mild conditions among others, has allowed tuning the type and amount of N-functionalities in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or graphene [89–93]. González-Gaitán et al. reported an electrochemical method to functionalize CNT by aminobenzene acids, obtaining a polymer thin film on the CNTs surface. These N-modified CNTs were carbonized in presence of low O2 concentration, leading to high contents of oxygen and nitrogen groups, such as pyridinic, pyrrole or pyridone [94]. Furthermore, the incorporation of nitrogen functionalization in carbon materials via nitric acid treatment should be also mentioned, as it has been fruitfully investigated for the preparation of numerous kinds of N-containing materials in many different applications [73,95–98]. Actually, the role of nitric acid in this kind of functionalization is not introducing directly the nitrogen groups but it is mainly used as a pretreatment to facilitate a subsequent functionalization of different carbon materials by using N-containing molecules such as amines, amides and so on. Yang et al. prepared N-doped carbon materials from petroleum coke by nitric acid preoxidation under mild temperature conditions, obtaining a nitrogen content around at 4 wt% [73]. Then, the pretreated material, which was modified with urea, displayed a nitrogen amount of 11.08 wt%, which resulted in the enhanced performance of these carbon materials in CO2 capture. Another carbon materials such as single-walled CNTs have also been successfully functionalized via nitric acid approach and subsequent amine functionalization [98], attaining soluble single-walled CNT. This approach was also used to functionalize carbon materials under mild conditions and then they were pyrolyzed at high temperatures to get the desired N-doped carbon material. For instance, Zhong et al. synthesized N-doped ordered mesoporous carbons for their use in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). A commercial mesoporous carbon was treated using nitric acid at 70 °C and melamine was added as nitrogen source at room temperature [99]. Then, the resulting material was pyrolyzed to get the N-doped carbon material for their use as electrocatalyst. Therefore, the strategy based on a nitric acid pretreatment followed by a chemical reaction with N-containing molecules is a suitable platform to prepare N-doped carbon materials for their use in a wide range of applications."
3,In-situ doping methods,"2.2 In-situ doping methods In the in-situ doping syntheses, both the nitrogen doping and the synthesis of carbon materials occur at the same time. One of the most used methods is the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) because it is suitable to attain well-distributed nitrogen groups into the carbon network. It has been successfully used to prepare N-doped carbon materials such as graphene, CNTs, CNFs or microporous carbon [100–105]. Recently, Castro-Muñiz et al. reported a novel method to prepare co-doped microporous carbons with a high surface area by infiltration of a N-containing ionic liquid (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetracyanoborate) into a Y zeolite followed by CVD. This approach led to co-doped microporous carbon that mainly showed pyridinic nitrogen, although pyrrolic and graphitic were also observed [104]. N-CNFs have also been produced by CVD using C2H4/NH3 mixtures, showing a higher pyridinic groups content as the N-containing precursor rises [106]. Carbonization of N-containing precursors, followed in some cases by chemical activation, has been widely used to obtain N-doped porous carbons. In this respect, there are many N-containing sources, which include conducting polymers, ionic liquids (ILs), biomass and so on [107–113]. The well-established syntheses of conducting polymers have attracted great attention because N-doped carbons with a wide range of structures as well as different nitrogen content can be achieved [112,114–118]. Gavrilov et al. reported the preparation of N-doped carbon materials from polyaniline (PANI) by carbonization at 800 °C using different salt precursors, which led to nitrogen contents of around 9 at% and the deconvolution of N1s spectra showed that pyridinic and graphitic groups were the most abundant [112]. However, the graphitic/pyridinic ratio is different depending on initial precursors. Therefore, the selection of experimental conditions such as carbonization temperature, type of monomer or polymerization time plays a key role in the resulting nitrogen groups. Proof of this can be seen in the fact that N-doped carbon materials, which were synthesized from PANI under different experimental conditions and carbonized at 800 °C, have also shown a clear contribution of pyrrolic/pyridone groups apart from graphitic and pyridinic ones [107]. Owing to their physicochemical properties as well as their nitrogen content, imidazolium/pyridinium ILs have also been used to prepare N-doped carbon materials. Mesoporous N-doped carbon was obtained by carbonization of N-butyl-3-methylpyridinium using a hard template [119], giving conductive carbon materials with a high nitrogen content (>15 wt %) that was attributed to the presence of pyrrolic, pyridinic and graphitic groups. Recently, Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) containing N-organic ligands were investigated as a precursor of N-doped carbon materials in diverse applications because they exhibit interesting features such as high surface area, large pore volume and a wide range of nanostructures [120–125]. Chen et al. reported the electrospinning method to produce hollow particle-based N-doped carbon nanofibers from electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and ZIF-8 and hierarchical porous nanofibers that showed graphitic domains and high nitrogen content (∼8 wt%) obtained after carbonization at 900 °C [126]. Regarding N-containing groups for the final N-CNFs, the most abundant were pyridinic and pyrrolic groups and the latter one turned into graphitic as the carbonization temperature increased. To conclude the in-situ methods, biomass-derived N-doped carbon materials have to be mentioned. Biomass provides advantages such as abundance, low cost and environmentally friendliness that make it a promising candidate to scale-up the production of N-doped carbon materials. In this sense, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is the most used route to obtain carbon materials from biomass [127–132]. Biomass-derived N-doped carbon materials can be prepared by carbonization of N-containing biomass or mixture of biomass and N-containing precursors [64,109,131,133]. However, the resulting hydrochars usually have low surface area and closed porosity, and a subsequent heat-treatment or chemical activation step is needed, which causes the loss of a substantial part of their nitrogen content [134]. Conventional pyrolysis of biomass has been performed to develop carbon materials with high surface area using a carbonization step that can help to keep more nitrogen groups. Liu et al. reported the preparation of N-doped carbon nanosheets from chitosan without chemical activation, obtaining high surface area and moderate nitrogen content corresponding to pyridinic and graphitic groups [131]. Recently, Ma et al. described a carbonization method using KCl/ZnCl2 to promote the porosity in mixtures of biomass and melamine, leading to mesoporous N-doped carbons with remarkable nitrogen content (11.9%) in the case of biomass-derived N-doped carbon materials [135]. Despite the aforementioned progress and goals achieved in the synthesis of N-doped carbon materials using different approaches, the preparation of N-doped carbon materials with tunable nitrogen speciation and content is still challenging."
4,Synthesis of metal catalysts supported on N-doped carbon materials,"2.3 Synthesis of metal catalysts supported on N-doped carbon materials The use of N-doped carbon as support of NPs has been claimed as a promising alternative to achieve small and well-dispersed NPs, which, as a rule of thumb, results in better catalytic performances due to the larger number of the surface atom. The use of capping agents has classically been the most successful approach to control the NPs growth and obtain small NPs on the surface of the support [36,136–138]. Nevertheless, the use of such molecules is still in dispute because of their detrimental effect on the catalytic activity by partial blocking of the active sites of the NPs [139]. N-doped carbon supports are a burgeoning alternative to achieve small and well-distributed NPs that circumvent the shortcomings displayed by those capping agent-protected NPs. Not without reason, the nitrogen functionalities are claimed to act as “tether” improving the catalytic performance by enhancing the dispersion of the NPs and endowing them with agglomeration and coarsening resistance [140]. Nevertheless, the nitrogen functional groups introduced into the carbon supports do not only modify the growth kinetics during the NPs deposition and metal-support interaction, but also the electronic properties of the NPs and the acid-base properties of the final materials, which have been examined by both experimental and theoretical studies [101,141–143]. The role of N-containing carbons in controlling the nucleation, growth and stabilization of NPs and their properties while considering various synthetic approaches can be found in the literature and they have already been recapitulated elsewhere [48]. Analogous to non-doped carbon catalysts, a plethora of alternatives for the synthesis of NPs supported on N-doped carbon materials can be found in the literature, and only some of the most used routes will be briefly mentioned herein. They can be divided in the three following categories [49]: (i) loading of NPs on a pre-synthesized N-doped carbon material; (ii) simultaneous incorporation of metal phase and nitrogen on a pre-synthesized carbon material; and (iii) in-situ synthesis of NPs on a N-doped carbon support. Loading of NPs on pre-synthesized N-doped carbon materials implies conventional methods, such as impregnation (either wet or incipient wetness impregnation), deposition-precipitation, and sol-immobilization and subsequent reduction of the metal precursors. Then, even though these methods allow the control of the support properties, it is not the preferred option because of the multi-step needed [61]. The simultaneous incorporation of metal and nitrogen functionalization is commonly achieved by pyrolysis of mixtures containing metal and nitrogen precursors and carbon supports under certain conditions [144], while the in-situ synthesis of NPs on N-doped carbon supports are also generally prepared by following a pyrolysis step in which the carbon precursor is added to the mixture instead of the pre-synthesized carbon support. It was reported that the features of the resulting NPs are strongly dependent on the synthetic route. In this vein, Yang et al. conducted a systematic study in which Pt NPs were supported on N-doped carbon nanotubes (Pt/N-CNTs) by following various synthetic approaches (i.e ethylene glycol reduction, sodium borohydride reduction and impregnation-H2-reduction) [145]. It was found that the method used affected the electronic properties of the NPs because of the different mechanism of their formation. Furthermore, the electronic properties were tuned by the metal-support interaction between Pt and N, which ultimately affected the final performance of the catalysts. Aside from these classical synthetic routes, the use of MOF as a sacrificial template to obtain metal/N-carbons has been recently proposed as an attractive option. MOFs are constructed by organic linkers and metal joints [146] so that a careful pyrolysis treatment would convert the linker into carbon metal-carbon composites that would contain nitrogen upon proper selection of the linkers [147]. This approach has been followed to synthesize catalysts with interesting compositions and architectures (i.e. gold-NPs-embedded into N-doped nanoporous carbon NPs (Au@NC) [148], cobalt-embedded in N-doped porous carbons [149], one-dimensional N-doped bamboo-like carbon nanotube encapsulated Co NPs (Co/N-BCNTs), two-dimensional N-doped carbon nanosheet (N-CNS) and three-dimensional N-doped carbon nanotube framework encapsulated Co NPs (Co/N-CNTFs) [150], FeCo alloy core@nitrogen-doped carbon shell NPs anchored on carbon nanotubes [151], core-shell Co@Co3O4 NPs embedded in CNT-grafted N-doped carbon-polyhedra [152], etc.). However, since the final application of such catalysts is different from that reviewed in this paper, further details will not be herein provided."
5,Metal catalysts supported on N-doped carbon materials for the hydrogen production from hydrogen carrier molecules,"As previously mentioned, the use of N-doped carbon materials has been traditionally linked to electrochemical applications, either as support of NPs or in metal-free systems [153]. But, even though their importance in that field is unquestionable, their use in different catalytic reactions (i.e. catalytic reductions [57,105], catalytic oxidations [154,155], oxidative coupling reactions [156,157], Fischer–Tropsch synthesis [158,159]) has been widely spread in the last decade [55]. However, as revising all of them is beyond the scope of this review, readers are encouraged to check some of the recent literature to have a broader overview of the application of metal catalysts supported on N-doped carbon materials. Herein, some of the recent breakthroughs achieved in the hydrogen production from some representative hydrogen carrier molecules will be summarized."
6,Dehydrogenation of formic acid,"3.1 Dehydrogenation of formic acid Formic acid (FA, HCOOH) holds great promise as a renewable hydrogen carrier molecule because of its low-toxicity, stability and high hydrogen content (53 g L−1), thus attracting the interest of the research community. This fact is reflected in the numerous publications reporting various strategies for the design of active and selective catalysts for the FA dehydrogenation reaction (HCOOH ↔ H2 + CO2) [37–41,160,161]. It has been observed that the presence of basic functional groups in the support significantly enhances the hydrogen production ability by modifying the electronic density of the metallic active sites and/or by active participation in the FA dehydrogenation as a hydrogen scavenger [162,163]. In particular, N-doped carbon materials have been shown to be an interesting option to achieve highly-performing catalytic systems and important advances have been achieved as a result of their exploration by using both theoretical and experimental approached. Bulushev et al. greatly contributed to the understanding of the Pd active species involved in the FA dehydrogenation in gas phase and their interaction with the nitrogen functionalities of carbon materials in their study on single isolated Pd2+ cations supported on N‑doped mesoporous carbon prepared by CVD [164]. The assessment of the catalytic activity revealed that the N-doped catalysts outperformed the N-free counterpart, providing TOF values that were 2–3 times higher than those values displayed by N-free catalysts and lower T50 (temperature of 50% of conversion). The thoughtful analysis of the N-doped catalysts by means of HAADF/STEM using a Titan 60–300 microscope allowed the identification of Pd isolated atoms and clusters with a few atoms which, coordinated with N-species, were responsible for the promoted catalytic ability. The existence of such species was also corroborated by XPS analysis. The preferable sites for Pd anchoring were further checked by DFT calculations by considering three types of N species (graphitic (Ngr), pyrrolic (NH), and pyridinic (Nv for pyridinic nitrogen at a vacancy and Ne for pyridinic nitrogen at a graphene edge) and locating a Pd atom into several positions in the graphene fragment (positions 1–8 in See Fig. 4 ). The analysis of such theoretical investigation revealed that Pd atoms tend to interact preferentially with two edges pyridinic nitrogen and those active sites interact strongly with FA molecules, favoring the CH bond cleavage and the chemisorption of a hydrogen atom and carboxyl fragment. Further investigations on Pt, Pd or Ru supported on N-doped carbon nanofibers also confirmed the role of N functionalization in attaining single metal atoms with excellent performance in the FA dehydrogenation reaction [165,166]. The importance of pyridinic-nitrogen doping species to afford promoted Pd active species was also reported by Cao et al. [167]. That conclusion was drawn by evaluating the catalytic ability of CNx-supported Pd catalysts (x ranging from 0.15 to 0.95), in a study in which a bio-chitosan-based pyrolysis strategy was utilized for the synthesis of the supports. The proper characterization of the catalysts by means of XPS and ATR-IR spectroscopy suggested the presence of electron rich Pd species. It was found that the sample Pd/CN0.23 was the most active among investigated, which was attributed to its higher pyridinic-N/Pd molar ratio determined in that sample as compared to other catalysts and the ability of such N species to modulate the electronic features of Pd species. Wang et al. recently reported on the use of N-doped hierarchically porous carbon (denoted as NHPC-AC) synthesized by a ""leavening” strategy by using NaHCO3 (as a foaming agent) and NH4HCO3 (as both foaming agent and N source) (See Fig. 5 ) [58]. The as-synthetized support was further used for the loading of Pd NPs (Pd/NHPC-AC). The resulting catalysts showed much smaller mean NPs size than those observed for the N-free HPC catalysts (Pd/HPC-AC) and the activated carbon-supported counterpart (1.88, 2.56 and 3.31 nm for Pd/NHPC-AC, Pd/HPC-AC and Pd/AC, respectively), confirming the important role of N-doping in promoting the dispersion of the metal NPs. In contrast to what was previously observed by Bulushev [164], N-doping was shown to provide a larger proportion of Pd (0) as compared to the N-free samples, which had a positive repercussion on the catalytic performance as indicated by the volume of gas generated from the FA decomposition catalyzed by Pd/NHPC-AC, Pd/HPC-AC and Pd/AC as well as for the good reusability of the N-containing catalysts. Park et al. also reported on the investigation of N-doped hierarchically porous carbon with graphene-like structure (denoted as KIE-8). In that case, the supports were prepared from an easy approach based on the pyrolysis of chitosan/urea/KOH mixtures (i.e N-containing carbon precursor/activating agent/nitrogen source and structure directing agent for the formation of graphene structure) at temperatures ranging from 700 to 1000 °C [168]. It was found that pore structure and nitrogen structure were affected by the carbonization temperatures and that both features modified the particle size, dispersion and electronic structure of the Pd NPs deposited on KIE-8, which in turn affected the catalytic ability. It was concluded that the supports with higher pore volume, surface area and graphitic nitrogen content displayed better catalytic performances, reaching a TOF value of 280.7 mol H2 mol metal−1 h−1 for the most active catalyst among studied. Our research group recently published a study on Pd-based catalysts supported on N-doped xerogels (NCX), synthesized via polycondensation of melamine-resorcinol-formaldehyde, in which the effect of the pore texture and nitrogen content in the catalytic performance was also assessed [113]. The composition of the precursor solution was modified in order to get various N-doping levels (0, 2, 4 and 8 wt%) and different pore textures (combination of either micro-mesoporosity or micro-macroporosity, denoted as aN-CX-meso and N-CX-macro, where “a” is the nitrogen content). XPS analysis confirmed the presence of high content of pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen functionalities, responsible for the increase of the local basicity of the resulting N-CX. In addition, the Pd-N interaction was confirmed by means of Pd K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysts. Catalysts with low and moderate nitrogen content (2 and 4 wt%) favored the synthesis of small and well-distributed Pd NPs, while larger nitrogen loading (8 wt%) led to NPs with larger mean size (See Fig. 6 ). The evaluation of the catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts indicated that, while the N-free catalysts displayed a very poor activity, generating only 8 mL of gas (H2 + CO2), N-containing samples showed better activities. Among the catalysts based on N-doped xerogels, various aspects were observed. On the one hand, the porous texture of the xerogels had an important role in determining the catalytic activity, being those samples with a micro-mesoporous texture more suitable than those with micro-macroporous texture. On the second hand, the N-content was also crucial and it was shown that the optimum N-content under the experimental conditions considered in that study was 4 wt%. The combination of a suitable porous texture and adequate N-content in the carbon xerogel afforded the synthesis of small and well-dispersed Pd NPs, resulting in a very promising catalyst for the FA dehydrogenation reaction with an initial TOF of 2014 h−1. Even though most of the catalysts supported on N-doped carbon used for the FA dehydrogenation are based on monometallic Pd NPs, some bimetallic systems can be found in the literature. In this vein, Chen et al. also examined the importance of the N speciation by performing a systematic study on AuPd NPs supported on N-doped carbon nanosheets (n-CNS) with controllable surface specific area, nitrogen loading and nitrogen bonding configurations [169]. N-CNS were prepared through heat treatment of g-C3N4-glucose composites and they were subsequently loaded with bimetallic AuPd NPs using a standard impregnation method. The better catalytic ability of the AuPd/N-CNS versus AuPd/g-C3N4 made the authors of that study speculate that the nitrogen bonding configuration (i.e speciation) but not the nitrogen content was the crucial factor in attaining highly performing catalysts and it was found that the sample with the higher Ngraphitic/Npyridinic ratio displayed the best catalytic activity towards the FA dehydrogenation, which was attributed to its ability to affect the electronic features of the metal NPs and minimize the NPs size. Wang et al. reported on AgPd functionalized zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) derived N-decorated nanoporous carbon (AgPd@NPC) [170]. The synthetic strategy followed in that study consisted in the preparation of ZIF-8 (Zn(MeIM)2, MeIM = 2-methylimidazole), followed by its carbonization at various temperatures (800, 900 and 1000 °C) and subsequent impregnation and reduction of the metal precursors (AgNO3 and H2PdCl4). Various Ag/Pd ratios were investigated. It was concluded that the presence of Zn, as well as the Ag/Pd ratio and carbonization temperature, affected the catalytic performance of the system. Etemadi et al. also investigated a AgPd system supported on N-doped graphene carbon nanotube aerogel (Ag@Pd/N-GCNT) [171]. As for other systems, the presence of nitrogen was claimed to enhance the electrical conductivity and immobilization of the NPs by strengthening the interaction with the support. Due to the properties of the support and alloyed NPs, the resulting catalysts displayed good ability for the FA dehydrogenation, with a TOF value of 413 h−1 at 25 °C. Jiang et al. recently reported their study on NiPd NPs supported on NH2-functionalized and N-doped reduced graphene oxide (NH2-N-rGO) prepared from a facile one-step synthesis approach schematized in Fig. 7 and using various Ni:Pd molar ratios (0:1, 0.2:0.8, 0.4:0.6, 0.6:0.4, 0.8:0.2, and 1:0) [172]. The N-doping of the support combined with NH2 functionalization afforded the preparation of well-dispersed and very small NPs of 1.8 nm, in contrast with the larger NPs observed for those samples N-rGO without NH2 functionalization and bare rGO (6.0 and 10.2 nm, respectively). This observation, together with the excellent hydrophilicity observed in the resulting catalyst made the authors believe that the N-doping increased the dispersion of the NPs while the further NH2 addition resulted in more hydrophilic catalysts and assisted the preparation of well-dispersed ultrafine NPs. XPS analysis indicated that the electronic features of Pd were modified by both, electron transfer from Ni and through the SMSI effect, which resulted in electron-rich Pd species that promote the FA dehydrogenation by facilitating the CH cleavage step, reaching a TOF value of 954.3 mol H2 h−1."
7,Decomposition of ammonia borane,"3.2 Decomposition of ammonia borane Ammonia borane (AB, NH3BH3) is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the most prolifically investigated hydrogen carrier molecules, which is not only due to its high hydrogen content (19.5 wt%) but also to its stability in air, non-toxicity and commercial availability. AB was synthesized for the first time within a program of the US government to prepare B-based jet fuels in the 1950s and it is an outstanding hydrogen carrier candidate because its decomposition leads to CO2-free hydrogen generation [173]. Among the possible AB decomposition pathways, its hydrolytic dehydrogenation (NH3BH3 + 2H2O → NH4BO2 + 3H2) is the most studied route. Unlike the commonly investigated Pd-based heterogeneous catalysts used to boost the FA dehydrogenation reaction, much more variety of compositions have been considered for the efficient realization of AB decomposition and, in this case, the use of N-containing carbon supports have been reported to be an interesting tool to achieve enhanced catalytic performances for both, noble metal and non-noble-metal catalysts. Fan et al. recently reported their study on ultrafine monodisperse Ru NPs supported on N-doped hierarchically porous carbon material (Ru/HPCM) [174], in which both, confinement space of the support and nitrogen functionalities, were claimed to be pivotal aspects to increase the stability and reusability of the catalysts via preservation of formed small NPs (1.41 nm). XPS analysis helped the authors of that study to confirm the presence of pyridinic, pyrrolic and graphitic nitrogen groups. According to what was postulated, both pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen groups enhanced the catalytic activity of carbon surface by means of decreasing the energy barrier for reactant adsorption on adjacent carbon atoms and facilitating the electron transfer, and by leading to the creation of non-uniform distribution of electrons on the graphene structure, respectively. The resulting Ru catalysts showed good activity, with a TOF value of 440 min−1 and good reusability, conserving 50% of the activity after 8 consecutive runs. As for non-noble metal catalysts, Chen et al. reported their study on Co NPs embedded in porous N-doped carbon (Co@N-C) synthesized from the direct carbonization of Co(salen) at various temperatures (600–800 °C) [175]. It was found that temperatures up to 700 °C were suitable to achieve well-dispersed Co NPs. XPS analysis confirmed the presence of pyridinic, pyrrolic and graphitic nitrogen species, as well as zerovalent Co. Among the catalysts assessed, that prepared at 700 °C displayed the best performance, attributed to a better dispersion of the Co NPs as compared to those catalysts synthesized at other temperatures. Furthermore, that sample was stable and kept 97.2% of its initial activity after 10 catalytic cycles, which outperformed the reference sample prepared by loaded Co NPs on the surface of a porous N-doped carbon. Lue et al. used a N-doped graphene hydrogel (NGH) as supports of P-doped CoB NPs, using NaBH4 as a boron source and reductant [176]. It was found that the level of phosphorous doping affected the catalytic activity and the sample Co0.79B0.15P0.06/NGH displayed the highest activity among investigated, reaching a TOF value of 32.8 min−1. The comparison of that sample with that supported on graphene oxide indicated that the three-dimensional NGH had a positive effect on the hydrolysis of AB. Chen et al. reported a more sophisticated study in which small Co NPs supported on N-doped porous carbon nanowires (Co/NPCNW) were prepared by carbonization of a Co-containing MOF at various temperatures (from 500 to 800 °C). It was found that the optimum sample was that prepared at 700 °C. According to what was reported in that study, the presence of nitrogen facilitated the homogeneous dispersion of Co NPs and enhanced the interaction between carbon nanowires and NPs via electron delocalization. The beneficial effect of the nitrogen species was pointed out by comparison with a reference sample based on Co NPs loaded on carbon nanorods (Co/C). The results of FTIR analysis suggested that the N-doping was beneficial for the weakening of the BN bond, facilitating the rate-controlling step. Mahyari and Shaabani investigated the applicability of Ni NPs immobilized on three-dimensional N-doped graphene catalysts (NiNPs@3D-(N)GFs) in the hydrolysis of AB [177]. The effect of nitrogen in the catalytic performance was analyzed by checking the activity of samples with nitrogen contents ranging from 2.46 to 4.73 atomic per cent and it was found that in the case of the catalyst with a 3.65% of nitrogen the reaction was finished after 8 min with 100% of conversion of AB to hydrogen. The addition of nitrogen was responsible for the SMSI and the efficient immobilization of the NPs, as well as for the increase of the surface basicity and polarity. The use of N-doped carbon as support of catalysts for the hydrogen generation from AB was also investigated in the case of bimetallic NPs. This was the case of Su et al., who performed a study using N-doped Vulcan XC-72 (NXC; prepared from the addition of pyrrole and subsequent calcination) and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as supports of bimetallic AuCo and AuNi [178] and following three different pathways for the reduction of the NPs (in-situ reduction with NaBH4 and NH3BH3, ex-situ reduction with NaBH4 and in-situ reduction with NH3BH3 as only reducing agent). The results of the characterization of the samples and the catalytic tests revealed that, even though AuCo catalysts showed smaller NPs using C3N4 as support, the catalytic activity was better for those NPs supported on NCX. It was also observed that AuNi displayed poorer performances than AuCo counterparts. Among all catalysts investigated, NXC-supported AuCo catalyst prepared by in-situ reduction using NaBH4 and NH3BH3 showed the best activity, with a TOF value of 42.1 molH2 molcat −1 min−1. Aside from the direct nitrogen doping of the support carbon material, the incorporation of nitrogen functionalization in the form of N-rich capping ligand is an elegant strategy to modify the features of the catalysts and it has already been reviewed in some works [36,139,179]. Lu et al. followed this approach in their study on amine-rich polyethylenimine (PEI)-capped Co NPs deposited on graphene oxide (PEI-GO/Co), with a PEI content of around 62 wt% relative to GO [180]. The addition of PEI was claimed to play a key role in controlling the morphology and size of the Co NPs. The numerous anchoring coordination sites for Co2+ ion provided by PEI suppressed the motion of reduced Co atoms once the reducing agent was added. As a result, small and amorphous Co NPs were formed within the PEI layer and some amine ligands remained on their surface. The catalytic tests performed with PEI-GO/Co and amine-free catalysts revealed a notably accelerating role of the AB hydrolysis, reaching a TOF value of 39.9 mol H2 min−1mol Co−1, which was attributed to a morphological control of the Co NPs exerted by PEI chain and a synergistic effect of amine ligands. The authors exhaustively analyzed the role of amine ligands in the AB dehydrogenation by performing a systematic study with various capping agent (i.e. polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), poly (acrylic acid) (PAA), 1,2-ethylenediamine (EDA), trimethylamine (TEA), diisopropylamine (DIPA), branched PEI (BPEI) and linear PEI (LPEI)). According to the analysis conducted, the mechanism schematized in Fig. 8 was proposed. It can be explained as follows: due to the formation of dihydrogen bonds between amine groups of PEI and AB, a higher concentration of AB was achieved near the surface of the catalysts. Such AB molecules resulted activated because of the interaction of “NH” bond with the metal. Furthermore, such dihydrogen bonds can lead to the transformation of AB into activated species (“−NH···HBH2−”), reducing the activation energy and weakening the “BN” bonds. These weakened “BN” bonds are subsequently attacked by water molecules, followed by hydrogen generation via hydrolysis of the BH3 intermediate. A subsequent investigation conducted by the same research group was aimed at enhancing the reusability of the previously investigated catalytic system (PEI-GO2D/Co) by means of constructing a 3D structure of PEI-GO with a large content of amine groups (PEI–GO3D/Co). The better stability observed for the 3D-based catalyst as compared with the 2D counterpart was claimed to arise from a prevented aggregation and oxidation of the Co NPs in the 3D structure [57]. Furthermore, it should be noted that not only metal-containing catalysts based on N-doped carbon materials are efficient to boost the AB dehydrogenation, but metal-free systems have also been explored in the literature. Yu et al. reported the suitability of various N-containing carbon nanostructures (i.e. N-doped graphene, N-doped CNTs, and covalent triazine-based framework (CTF)) as metal-free catalysts for the AB dehydrogenation [62]. Their study revealed that nitrogen lone pairs allow the hydrogen transfer from AB to the carbon material favoring the release of molecular hydrogen. DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the optimized geometry of the AB molecule on graphene and nanotubes (Fig. 9 ). The most stable adsorption configuration was found to be the structure where the NB bonds in AB molecules are parallel to the surface of carbon structure (Fig. 9 (a) and (c)) and showed weak binding strength between AB and graphene/nanotubes, while in the case of N-containing carbon materials, AB molecules tend to be adsorbed near the pyridinic N sites, with the NH3 fragment approaching the surface (see Fig. 9 (b) and (d)). It was explained in that study that the addition of electron-accepting nitrogen atoms provoked charge delocalization, which resulted in a strong electric field able to attract positive charge H atoms in AB and allowed the chemisorption of such molecules near the pyridinic N functions. A detailed theoretical investigation supported by experimental results were further included in that study to elucidate the reaction mechanism of AB dehydrogenation over metal-free nitrogen-containing materials."
8,Water splitting,"3.3 Water splitting Over the past decades, hydrogen production via water splitting has attracted an especial attention because it certainly constitutes a sustainable, renewable and clean source of energy [181]. Most research has been targeted on photocatalytic water splitting reaction as well as the design of efficient water splitting systems, mainly semiconductor-based photocatalysts [182,183]. However, since the physicochemical properties of raw and heteroatom-doped carbon material restrain their use as photocatalysts, electrochemical water splitting will be the principal focus of this section and some examples of photocatalytic water splitting using N-doped carbon materials will be briefly summarized at the end of the present section. Widespread efforts have been mainly focused on developing efficient and low-cost catalysts that foster the sluggish hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), thereby overcoming its kinetic barrier. At the present time, Pt-based catalysts have showcased prominent efficiencies for HER [184–186], but their traditional drawbacks, such as high cost and shortage, hinder their scaled-up usage. In this context, the main challenges faced by researchers on this field are the development of transition metal-based catalysts as well as the design and optimization of supports to stabilize noble or non-noble metal NPs in order to develop catalysts able to achieve desirable performances in HER. In this vein, N-containing carbon-based supports have attracted a great deal of attention because nitrogen doping changes the electronic state density of carbon supports. It was demonstrated that such electronic alteration generates new active sites, which boosted other electrocatalytic reaction performance [187]. Additionally, as stated above, the presence of some nitrogen groups may avoid the agglomeration of metal NPs by promoting the SMSI, which also improves the performance in HER [42]. The importance of N-doped carbon materials to enhance the HER performance has been extensively reported in the literature. Wang et al. recently reported a study on ultra-small Ru NPs incorporated into a N-doped carbon framework [188]. To do this, Ru tetramine-phatalocyanine complex (RuPc-NH2) was synthesized using a N-containing macrocycle and it was confined using graphene oxide (GO) by direct pyrolysis (Ru@NG). This catalyst showed highly dispersed ultra-small Ru NPs (∼1 nm) and effective N-doping confirmed by the high defects concentration into the carbon network. In this case, the chemical anchoring between Ru-N hampered the sintering of NPs and generated actives sites for HER. Regarding its electrocatalytic activity, Ru@NG displayed a HER current density of 10 mA cm−2 (threshold value for the conversion of solar fuel) at 20 mV in alkaline medium, which was 13 mV lower than commercial Pt-based catalysts under the same conditions. In order to compare the electrocatalytic activity, ruthenium NPs were embedded in another kind of N-doped carbon material (Ru@NC) and non-confined N-doped counterpart (Ru/NC). Ru@NG not only exhibited better performance than those displayed by Ru@NC and Ru/NC catalysts in alkaline medium, but Ru@NG also showed higher activity for HER in buffer solution compared to Ru@NC and Ru/NC. Moreover, durability tests for Ru@NG were performed under severe conditions in both alkaline and acid medium, showing high stability. After this, it was concluded that the chemical anchoring Ru-N together with the confinement space using GO led to the increase of stable active sites for HER. Despite the fact that this strategy is a promising platform to design HER catalysts with high activity and durability, and the competitive price of Ru as compared to Pt, the development of catalysts based on earth-abundant and inexpensive precursors remains as the main challenge from the commercialization point of view. In this sense, Co has been of great interest because of its interesting performance. Zhou et al. reported their investigation on N-doped carbon-encapsulated Co NPs on N-doped graphene nanosheets (Co@NC/NG) in which the experimental results together with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations helped the authors to propose the active sites for HER (see Fig. 10 ) [189]. XRD and TEM demonstrated the formation of Co/C composite and XPS measurements confirmed the effective N-doping of graphene matrix in the form of pyridinic and pyrrolic groups. The evaluation of the HER performance rendered values of -0.049 V vs RHE and 79.3 mV dec−1 of onset potential and Tafel slope in acid medium, respectively. Although both Tafel slope and onset potential were lower than those shown in commercial Pt-based catalysts, they clearly surpassed the values obtained from its counterpart sample (-0.172 V vs RHE and 112 mV dec−1) that consisted of non-wrapped Co NPs supported on N-doped graphene (Co/NC/NG). Furthermore, catalysts with analogous Co content supported on raw graphene (Co3O4/G and Co/G) displayed a significantly poorer electrocatalytic activity compared to Co@NC/NG. Additionally, Co@NC/NG presented high stability after 1000 cycles, keeping almost the activity towards HER of the fresh catalyst. Moreover, DFT calculations showed that the catalytic active sites were located at carbon atoms that were boosted by the Co NPs. On the basis of the above mentioned, it was not only confirmed that N-doping played a pivotal role but also wrapping carbon material and Co species also had an effect on the HER performance. Such enhancement of catalytic activity in carbon atoms promoted by Co NPs and N-doping have resulted in a great interest of Co-based N-doped carbon catalysts. Chen et al. recently reported an original route to prepare ultrafine Co NPs encapsulated in N-doped CNTs grafted onto reduced GO (Co@N-CNTs@rGO) by using GO and ZIFs (See Fig. 11 ) [190]. Their catalyst displayed features such as a homogeneous distribution of NPs, high surface area and a high degree of graphitization promoted by Co NPs. ZIF8@GO, ZIF67@GO and ZIF67@ZIF68 were also prepared following this approach. From the deconvoluted XPS N1s spectra, 4 peaks attributed to nitrogen species (graphitic, pyridinic, pyrrolic) and the Co-N bond, (which became bigger as the molar ratio of N/Co increased) were observed. This fact was particularly relevant because Co-N, which is considered to be crucial as an active site for HER, could be fixed by the N-doping level. The HER performance was evaluated in 1.0 M KOH and Co@N-CNTs@rGO displayed the lowest overpotential (108 mV) to provide 10 mA cm−2 among all catalysts. Therefore, it indicated that the Co@N-CNTs@rGO catalyst was more active than other synthesized electrocatalysts for HER. In order to get further insight into the mechanism, the Tafel slope was calculated and the Co@N-CNTs@rGO catalyst showed a value of 55 mV dec-1. It revealed that the HER evolved according to the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. Moreover, this value is nearly as small as commercial catalyst (20% Pt@C), indicating the high HER catalytic activity of Co@N-CNTs@rGO, which was due to the interaction among Co NPs, N-CNTs and GO that facilitated the charge transfer. Regarding the stability test, outstanding results were observed, since a current density value of ca. 20 mA cm−2 was retained after 100 cycles. Additionally, Co@N-CNTs@rGO catalyst also unveiled a noticeable electrocatalytic activity as well as good stability in an acid electrolyte. To conclude, DFT calculations demonstrated that N-doping and Co-C played a key role in the hydrogen adsorption, and consequently a suitable nitrogen content in the carbon network could improve the HER activity. Binary non-noble metal systems using N-doped carbon materials have also studied in HER [191,192]. Feng et al. performed a study on bimetallic systems (CoFe, CoCu and CoNi) embedded in N-doped carbon materials [191]. They were prepared by pyrolysis of bimetallic ZIFs precursors, selecting ZIF-67 due to its high Co-N contents in order to obtain CoM@NC (M = Fe, Cu, Ni). It was found that Co0.75Fe0.25-NC yielded the best HER activity. XPS measurements proved the presence of Co-Nx and M–N/Co-N interactions as well as the highest improvement in the electron transfer for Co0.75Fe0.25-NC according to the shift in the Co binding energy. The electrocatalytic performance was assessed in an alkaline electrolyte (1.0 M KOH) and Co0.75Fe0.25-NC needed an overpotential of 202 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2, which was near to those obtained from Co-based catalysts reported elsewhere [193,194]. To assure that M-N-C species were a pivotal aspect to enhance the HER activity, Co0.75Fe0.25-ZIF-67 and ZIF-67 catalysts were evaluated and their poorer HER performances compared to Co0.75Fe0.25-NC in terms of Tafel slope or onset potential, proved the importance of the M-N-C in HER catalysis. It also displayed good stability after 1000 cycles (cyclic voltammetry). The studied binary systems studied in this application do not only consist of two non-noble metal components, but some studies also combined a non-noble metal with a non-metallic element such as transition-metal phosphide or selenide [193,195]. Yang et al. reported their study on cobalt phosphide NPs wrapped with an ultrathin N-doped porous carbon layer (CoP@NC) [195] using Co-based ZIF (Fig. 12 ). The synergistic effect between CoP NPs and N-doped graphitic carbon wrapping was demonstrated to be a crucial point to enhance the HER performance by evaluating the activities of Co@NC, CoP@C and CoP in HER. CoP@NC catalyst showed the lowest onset potential (21 mV) in acid medium and only an overpotential of 78 mV was necessary to attain a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Furthermore, CoP@NC catalyst showed a Tafel slope of 49 mV dec-1, which is higher than 20% Pt/C (commercial). However, the Tafel slope for CoP@NC catalyst become lower than the commercial Pt-based catalyst under large overpotential conditions, indicating better HER performance for CoP@NC catalyst. The HER performance in 1.0 M KOH followed the same trend, indicating that CoP@NC catalyst is efficient in a wide range of pH. It was found that active sites for HER are preferably placed on the N-doped carbon layer instead of CoP, but additional experiments for all catalysts, such as Raman and polarization curves, revealed that CoP was also involved in the electron-transfer process. Finally, DFT calculations proved that nitrogen atoms activated the nearest neighbor C atoms. Another approach widely investigated in electrochemical reaction is the use of metal-free systems to enhance the electrochemical performance. In this respect, N-doped carbon materials have also been explored to enhance the HER performance [196–199]. Even though the enhancement of the HER activity for metal-free N-doped carbon materials have revealed some constraints in the case of single N-doping [197,200], metal-free N-doped carbon materials to boost the HER is still under consideration. Qu et al. reported the design of N-doped carbon materials through polydopamine (PDA) as a platform to prepare dual heteroatom-doped carbon materials that were assessed in HER [196]. The entire PDA structure could be efficiently modified by other secondary heteroatoms, leading to homogeneous doping in the resulting material. Following an in-situ doping approach, N, X-co-doped (X = B, P, S) carbon nanosheets (N, X-CN) were synthesized to study how the introduction of the second heteroatom in the carbon network affected the electrocatalytic HER. Their study revealed that the co-doped sample with S showed a larger improvement in HER performance compare to dual-heteroatom doping using P or B. Concerning the N,S-CN catalyst in acid electrolyte (0.5 M H2SO4), current density of 10 mA cm−2 was delivered at -0.29 V and it displayed a Tafel slope of 76.9 mV dec-1, which was lower than that shown by N-CN (159.3 mV dec-1), indicating the positive effect in the enhancement of HER performance. While N, P-CN exhibited a sensible improvement in HER activity, N, B-CN showed a negative effect. The same tendency for all catalysts was observed in 1.0 M KOH. DFT calculations performed assuming that the Volmer step is related to hydrogen adsorption on the graphene surface, helped the authors to elucidate why the sulphur co-doping showed the highest improvement. These calculations revealed that the lowest |ΔGH*| (low values boost the HER activity) was found in the case of N, S-CN (0.23 eV), while |ΔGH*| values for N, P-CN, N-CN and N, B-CN were 0.53, 0.81 and 1.10 eV, respectively. The moderate increase for N, P-CN in spite of its lower |ΔGH*| compared to N-CN was attributed to its low double-layer capacitance (Cdl), which in turn means a decrease in the number of exposed active sites. Furthermore, the durability test showed remarkable stability for both N, S-CN and N, P-CN. On the basis of the above, dual heteroatom-doped is a promising alternative to design metal-free carbon-based catalysts to boost HER activity. To conclude this section, it should be pointed out that, as mentioned before, not only N-doped carbon materials have been investigated to enhance the HER activity through electrochemical route, but they have also been used in photocatalytic hydrogen production [201–203]. Yeh et al. published a photocatalytic system, which consisted of N-doped graphene oxide-quantum dots (NGO-QDs) [201]. Such N-doped carbon material was prepared by ammonia treatment at 500 °C and subsequent oxidation process, leading to carbon materials with low nitrogen content (∼3 wt%) that mainly corresponded to pyrrolic groups, although XPS spectra also showed that pyridinic and graphitic groups were present. Moreover, XPS spectra also indicated high oxygen content (∼23 wt%) related to epoxy, ketone or carboxylic groups. Taking into account XPS measurements and TEM images, it was suggested that N and O configurations in NGO-QDs led to both n- and p-type conductivities to the graphene QDs, respectively. The band-gap calculated for NGO-QDs was nearly 2.2 eV and the system was able to produce excitons through visible adsorption light, leading to hydrogen and oxygen evolution from water. It demonstrated that NGO-QDs system was a good option to be used for overall water-splitting under solar illumination. Shi et al. reported the preparation of composites based on N-doped carbon quantum dot (NCD) supported on TiO2 to study the hydrogen evolution under UV and visible light irradiation conditions [203]. NCD samples were obtained from water/ethylenediamine mixtures by hydrothermal method, leading to NCDs with nitrogen contents ranging from 14 to 30 at%. NCD sample with the highest nitrogen content (NCDs-3) displayed an external quantum yield (EQY) of 66.8%, which is more than a two-fold increase compared to EQY obtained for NCD with 14 at. N% (NCDs-1), revealing the N-doping level effect on the photoexcitation efficiency. Hybrids catalysts based on NCDs-3 supported on TiO2 (P25) with NCDs-3 with loadings from 1 to 16% were evaluated for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in aqueous solution (25 vol% MeOH) under full-spectrum illumination. The best-performing result was for a NCDs-3 loading of 3%, exhibiting a hydrogen evolution rate of 9.8 μmol h−1. It was more than eight-fold increase compared to pristine catalyst (P25). Additionally, the durability test showed that NCDs-3/P25 remained stable after 8 h of light irradiation. Transient photocurrent measurements revealed that NCDs/P25 hybrids displayed higher photocurrent values than pristine P25. This improvement was attributed to the enhancement of charge separation in photoexcited P25, demonstrating that interfacial charge transfer was assisted by N-doping of NCDs, which in turn enhanced the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution."
9,Other hydrogen carrier molecules,"3.4 Other hydrogen carrier molecules Some representative hydrogen carrier molecules have been included in Section 3, and even though other molecules such as ammonia, hydrazine or alcohols, have also been successfully utilized to produce hydrogen [204–207]. Their decomposition over heterogeneous catalysts based on N-doped carbon materials is scarcely found in the literature. However, in order to include such important hydrogen carrier molecules in this review, some representative examples will be briefly mentioned herein. As alternative to the hydrogen-containing molecules mentioned in the previous section, ammonia (NH3) is one of the most promising molecules to produce hydrogen due to its high volumetric (17.6 wt%) and gravimetric (81 g L−1) hydrogen content, lower flammability than hydrogen, easy transportation, etc. However, one of the main points to be optimized in order to successfully implement ammonia as a hydrogen storage medium is its decomposition at low temperatures. Some strategies to get efficient catalysts at low temperature, such as the increase of basicity or graphitization in carbon supports, have already been performed [208,209]. In this line, Bell et al. reported on the use of Ru-based catalysts supported on N-doped CNTs [210]. A hydrothermal treatment with aqueous ammonia solution was used to modify pristine CNTs, leading to samples with N contents ranging from 0.5 to 2.1 at%. It was observed that Ru NPs supported on N-doped CNTs showed higher activity (TOF = 6276.3 LH2 mol Ru−1 h−1) than Ru NPs deposited onto N-free CNTs (TOF = 4432.7 LH2 mol Ru−1 h−1). This improvement in the catalytic activity was attributed to the enhancement of both basicity and conductivity of the support after nitrogen doping. As mentioned in the previous section, the nitrogen groups also play a key role in the average NPs size and dispersion as well as in the metal-support interaction. Chen et al. observed an enhancement of the dispersion of Ru NPs for nitrogen-containing CNT-based catalysts compared to the counterpart Ru NPs supported on the N-free CNT [207]. They used N2 MW plasma to prepare N-doped CNT using different MW power values that had an important effect on the nitrogen functionalities in the final support. It was observed that N-doped CNT support synthesized at lower MW power values exhibited a high content of pyridinic groups, which in turn led to Ru NPs-based catalyst with the lowest average NP size due to the improvement in metal-support interaction. It is important to mention this aspect because the ability to produce hydrogen from ammonia was directly related to the dispersion of Ru NPs. An improvement in the NPs dispersion on N-doped mesoporous carbon was also observed [206]. N-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (NOMC) as well as the N-free counterpart (OMC) were synthesized by a soft-templating approach. Subsequently, these OMCs were used as supports to prepare Ru-based catalysts and their catalytic activity for the ammonia decomposition was assessed. A clear enhancement of ammonia decomposition to hydrogen was observed for the catalyst based on NOMC compared to OMC. The highest activity for Ru/NOMC was ascribed to the nitrogen functionalities. Not only they played a crucial role in controlling the NPs size and dispersion but nitrogen groups could also be involved in the interaction between catalytic active sites and ammonia molecules. Another interesting hydrogen carrier is the hydrous hydrazine (H2NNH2·H2O), with a hydrogen content of 8.0 wt%, which has also merited consideration as a suitable liquid-phase hydrogen storage molecule. Its complete decomposition produces only hydrogen and nitrogen (H2NNH2 → 2H2 + N2). However, its partial decomposition can also occur (3H2NNH2 → 4NH3 + N2), and therefore, finding selective catalysts is mandatory in order to optimize the utilization of hydrous hydrazine for the generation of hydrogen. Despite of the significantly fewer investigations dealing with the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine over nitrogen doped-based catalysts found in the literature than those reporting on the hydrogen production from other representative hydrogen carrier molecules, some examples on the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine will be briefly mentioned in this section. In this case, Ni-based catalysts are well-known to be the preferred alternative and the use of various carbon materials doped with nitrogen has also been reported to be a suitable option to achieve highly dispersed NPs. Xia et al. used nitrogen-doped porous carbon synthetized from thermal decomposition zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) at different temperatures (800, 900, and 1000 °C) as support of NiRh NPs [211]. As for other studies, it was found that the nitrogen doping and level of graphitization depended on the temperature used in the thermal treatment step, while a highly porous structure was achieved in all cases. The nitrogen contents were determined to be of 8.15, 3.71, and 2.45 at%, for the sample prepared at 800, 900, and 1000 °C, respectively, with pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen as the main nitrogen species. Catalysts with various composition of the NPs were prepared and evaluated in the dehydrogenation of hydrous hydrazine at 50 °C. It was found that, aside from the Ni/Rh ratio present in the NPs, the temperature used to obtain the N-doped carbon support was important and the catalysts prepared using the support synthetized at 900 °C was the best-performing among investigated. This fact was ascribed to the level of graphitization, high surface area and high nitrogen content present in the support. The pivotal role of the support was evidenced by comparing the activity of the N-doped carbon support with those displayed by various catalysts synthetized with different commercial supports (SiO2, Al2O3, etc.). The same group also reported on NiPt catalysts supported on boron and nitrogen co-doped graphene. In that case, a suitable composition of the NPs of Ni3Pt7 and a synergistic effect of independent B and N doping was found to afford catalyst with a high activity and selectivity towards the hydrazine dehydrogenation reaction [205]. Alcohols are another type of hydrogen carrier molecules that should be mentioned. Various alcohols, from the simplest molecules like methanol to polyols, can be used to produce hydrogen. However, since revising the production of hydrogen from alcohol substrates is beyond the scope of this review, readers are encouraged to check some of the recent literature to have a broader overview of the new achievement made in this field [212,213]. Due to the distinguished importance of methanol (CH3OH) within the alcohols utilized in this application, only some examples of methanol dehydrogenation over N-doped carbon-based catalysts will be briefly summarized herein. Despite the ideality of methanol as hydrogen carrier because of its high hydrogen content (12.6 wt%), its decomposition to produce hydrogen is an endothermic reaction and high temperatures are normally needed [214]. As for the cases previously summarized, the use of N-doped materials was showed to be effective to realize the decomposition of methanol. For instance, Antonietti et al. reported on the selective dehydrogenation of methanol in gas-phase in a study in which the adsorption of methanol molecules was modulated by modifying the electron density of the Ni NPs by using carbon foams doped with various contents of nitrogen [204]. Experimental and theoretical results by means of DFT calculations revealed that the incorporation of larger nitrogen content resulted in more electron transfer from the Ni NPs to the support. It was observed that the strong interaction of methanol with the electron-deficient Ni NPs and electron-rich support resulted on substrate polarization and subsequent favored methanol dehydrogenation. García et al. also reported on the utilization of N-doped carbon materials for the generation of hydrogen from methanol [215]. In that case, the reaction was conducted using water/methanol (30% v/v) mixtures under solar irradiation and with N-doped graphene obtained from pyrolysis of chitosan as photocatalyst and in the absence of metallic phase. In contrast to graphene, the N-doped material showed activity for photocatalytic production of hydrogen from water/methanol mixtures."
10,Conclusion and future prospective,"In the present review, the importance of hydrogen as an energy carrier in a future renewable and pollutant-free energy scenario is pointed out along with the pivotal role of nitrogen-doped carbon material in attaining highly-performing catalysts able to boost the hydrogen production from representative hydrogen carrier molecules, such as formic acid, ammonia borane and water. Furthermore, a simple classification of the synthetic routes available for the preparation of N-doped carbon materials and related metal catalysts is provided. N-doped carbon materials are known to be a great platform for the stabilization of NPs with small and homogeneous sizes and modified electronic properties that come from their interaction with various nitrogen functional groups. In this line, not only nitrogen content but also nitrogen speciation is a crucial aspect to be considered while designing catalysts for a particular application. It has been observed that different nitrogen functionalization has a different effect on the final performance on the resulting material by virtue of their ability to modify the electronic features of the supported NPs and sizes, as well as hydrophilicity and acid/base properties of the catalysts. As for the case of formic acid, the beneficial role of nitrogen functionalities incorporated onto several carbon materials (e.g. hierarchically porous carbon, carbon xerogels, carbon nanosheets, etc.) has been profusely investigated by both experimental and theoretical approaches. Despite the still existing controversy on such aspects, the significant contribution of pyridinic groups in attaining high activities seems to be unquestionable. Furthermore, N-groups do not simply exert as a modifier of the features of NPs and catalysts´ surface, but also participate actively in the dehydrogenation reaction. In the case of the catalysts used to boost the ammonia borane dehydrogenation, N-functionalization of carbon material has been shown to be a useful tool to stabilize non-noble NPs, helping therefore in the designing of cost-competitive catalysts as an alternative to the noble-metal-based systems traditionally used for this application. Concerning hydrogen production through water splitting, N-doping in carbon materials has shown to be a promising strategy to increase the number of active sites for HER, boosting the electrocatalytic activity of the modified carbon materials compared to pristine counterparts. Such enhancement of HER activity is due to the fact that the introduction of nitrogen into the carbon network causes changes in the electronic state of the adjacent carbon atoms, leading to both M-N-C and N-C active sites for HER in metal N-doped carbon or metal-free N-doped carbon catalysts, respectively. Additionally, the role of N-doped carbon materials in the hydrogen production from other hydrogen carrier molecules, such as ammonia, hydrazine and methanol, was briefly mentioned. Despite the prolific investigations dealing with the synthesis of N-doping carbon materials and their use in catalytic applications, the control of the final nitrogen content and speciation still remain challenging and further efforts should be devoted in the forthcoming years to carefully design synthetic strategies to efficiently prepare N-doped carbon materials with the target features. The proper control of the nitrogen speciation would be essential to elucidate which particular functional group is involved in a certain reaction, being thus able to aim at the development of much more efficient catalysts. It can be envisaged that more joint research encompassing experimental and theoretical investigations will be indispensable to achieve such a goal. In the view of the interesting breakthroughs attained by using N-doped carbon materials, it could be foreseen that various heteroatoms with different electronic properties (i.e. Boron) and different size from carbon (i.e. Phosphorous and Sulphur) will be also soon explored for the preparation of catalysts for the hydrogen production from hydrogen carrier molecules. Such alternatives will provide innumerable options related to the synthesis and characterization of the materials and, even though significant efforts should be devoted to achieving the level of research maturity reached in the case of N-doped carbon materials, the multiple possibilities that will be opened up will certainly worth the dedication of those researchers interested in the modulation of the features of the catalysts by modification of the properties of the carbon supports."
