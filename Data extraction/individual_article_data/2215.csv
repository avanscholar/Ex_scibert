0,Introduction,"The carbon cycle involves the exchange of carbon compounds among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere, as shown in Fig. 1. Autotrophs absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) for photosynthesis, followed by consuming and accumulating carbon within animals. CO2 is then released back to the atmosphere through decomposition, respiration, combustion, and other anthropogenic activities. Greenhouse effects, ocean acidification and many environmental problems could be related to the excessive CO2 emission from industrial activities. Fig. 2 shows that the global energy-related CO2 emission increases from 2000 to 2020. It only declined about 5.8% in 2020 due to pandemics but rebounded by 4.8% by 2021 [1]. Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) strategies should be continually developed as there is no reducing sign of carbon emission and its negative impacts. A feasible CCUS strategy starts from an effective carbon capture method. There is a wide range of carbon capture technology available at full scale, including absorption, adsorption, membrane gas separation, and cryogenic. Different from absorption and adsorption, membrane technology offers pressure-driven capture without the requirement of chemicals and regeneration. Hence, carbon capture can be conducted at a small footprint with high sustainability using membrane technology. Membrane technology can also be easily integrated with the existing gas processing plants as it produces CO2 gas instead of dry ice, unlike the cryogenic processes. In recent years, the research works on membrane gas separation mainly focus on the different materials as the building blocks of membranes. This is because the membrane materials mainly govern the gas permeation mechanisms. The development of gas separation membranes requires chemicals such as polymers, ceramics, metals, zeolite, metal-organic frameworks or even composite with different separation mechanisms ( Fig. 3) in order to provide better efficiency. Glassy polymers such as cellulose acetate (CA), polysulfone (PSf) and polyamide (PI) are preferable in the construction of CO2 selective membrane since these materials are low in free volume for achieving high gas selectivity through solution-diffusion [2]. Besides low permeability, glassy polymers are affected by plasticization under high operating pressure above 10 bar. Due to their low cost, these glassy-polymeric membranes still dominate the gas separation membrane market with a size of USD 846 million in 2019 [3]. In recent researches, the glassy polymeric membranes were usually enhanced through chemical modification and/or filler incorporation. However, the modified membranes still performed under the trade-off between gas permeability and selectivity. To overcome such a trade-off in CO2 separation, facilitated gas permeation instead of solution-diffusion should be engineered. Facilitated gas permeation includes CO2 conversion to HCO3 - or CO3 2- due to catalytic effects of the amino groups. The reaction products are transported through the membrane and then CO2 is released at the permeate side continuously. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) membranes have been widely developed for facilitated permeation of CO2. PVA consists of vinyl group and alcohol group, as shown in Fig. 4. PVA market size is expected to increase due to the replacement of harmful chemicals in various industries [4]. It is biodegradable and soluble in water. The water solubility increases with PVA molecular weight, but it is slightly soluble in ethanol and not soluble in most organic solvents [5]. PVA dissolved in water can be easily coated on the top of the porous support and work as the CO2 selective layer. However, PVA coatings create additional mass transfer resistance. PVA membranes showed satisfactory tensile strength, flexibility, toughness, and stability in a wide range of temperatures, but the separation performance of PVA membranes was significantly affected by humidity(Limpan, Prodpran, Benjakul and Prasarpran) [6]. Fig. 5(a) shows the surface of a PVA membrane, while Fig. 5(b) shows the cross-section of a supported PVA membrane[7]. Fig. 6 shows the schematic of a carbon capture system using PVA membrane. [8]. PVA membranes were applied in many other applications besides CO2 separation [6]. There are several review papers that reveal their preparation methods, characteristics, and functionalities, as summarized in Table 1. Bolto et al. [9] reviewed different cross-linking agents of PVA membranes for water treatment. The cross-linking enhances the swelling but minimizes the compaction under pressure. The biomedical applications of chitosan/PVA composites were reviewed by Rafique et al. [10]. Kamoun et al. [11] further focused on the development of PVA as a hybrid hydrogel membrane for wound dressings and cover. Different polymers such as biopolymers, synthetic polymers, and even nanoparticles were blended with PVA to increase the healing efficiency. Wong et al. [12] summarized the PVA modification methods for fuel cells, namely grafting copolymerization, physical and chemical cross-linking and polymers blending. Recently, Sapalidis [13] reviewed the synthesis and applications of PVA membranes with porous structures. Comparing the focus of past review papers (Table 1), the modification of PVA membranes for carbon capture has not be reported although they have been extensively developed for CO2 separation through facilitated transportation. This review focuses on the PVA membranes developed for CO2 separation. The critical aspects of this paper include the study and comparison of different additives used to modify PVA membranes. Besides the modification strategies, the changes in membrane properties and CO2 facilitated transport across the membrane are discussed. The separation performance of the modified PVA membranes was compared in the Robeson plot to identify possible improvements in future works. The significance of this review paper is expected to grow under the increasing concerns on climate change and the expanding strategies in CCUS. Besides membrane improvement tactics, the constraints of PVA membranes in CO2 separation are important to be identified for practical use at the industrial scale."
1,Additives to improve facilitated properties of PVA membranes,
2,Polymers with fixed amine carriers,"2.1 Polymers with fixed amine carriers (i) Polyvinyl amine PVA membranes are conventionally modified using polymers with fixed amine carriers as summarized in Table 2. Polyvinyl amine (PVAm), is a linear polyelectrolyte with a high density of primary amine. It has been widely used as the fixed-site carrier in PVA membranes ( Fig. 7). PVAm is generally synthesized through the Hofmann reaction, but it is also commercially available [14]. As it is water-soluble, it can be blended with PVA solution to form CO2 selective membranes. Deng et al. [8] blended PVAm into PVA solution before coating on polysulfone (PSf) ultrafiltration membrane. The coating was cross-linked at up to 120 °C for 1 h. By increasing the humidity up to 90% at 200 kPa, the CO2/N2 selectivity and CO2 permeance were ramped up to 174 and 0.58 m3(STP)·m−2·h−1·bar−1, respectively. The free primary amino groups of PVAm facilitated CO2 permeation, while the PVA network upgraded the mechanical properties of the membrane. The membrane with a coating as low as 0.3 µm could maintain its separation performance within 400 h. Deng and Hägg [15] also reported on PVAm/PVA membrane, but they found out that the coating with thickness in the range of 0.3–2.5 µm could increase the CO2/CH4 selectivity near 40 and the CO2 permeability about 0.55 m3(STP)·m−2·h−1·bar−1 at 2 bar and 25 °C with 92% of humidity. Permeability decreased to 0.18 m3(STP)·m−2·h−1·bar−1 while the CO2/CH4 selectivity decreased to 32 when the operating pressure was increased from 200 kPa to 2000 kPa. The presence of sweep gas on permeate side did not disturb the membrane performance compared to humidity and feed pressure. The simulation results indicated that two-stage configurations with a recycled stream, either symmetric cascade or asymmetric cascade, could recover more methane at higher compression duty than the single-stage configuration. By increasing the plant capacity to 1000 Nm3/h, the biogas upgrading cost was estimated at $0.201 – 0.228 /Nm3 biogas upgrade. In their subsequent study, Deng and Hägg [16] observed CO2/CH4 selectivity improvement over pure polymer by controlling the PVAm content in the range of 60–80 wt%. The selectivity can reach up to 45 at 67 wt% of PVAm since the two polymer chains entanglement can avoid excessive swelling and keep the amine carrier at a higher concentration to facilitate CO2 transport. Meanwhile, the CO2 permeability increased as the PVAm concentration increased. CO2 permeance of 0.58 m3(STP)·m−2·h−1·bar−1 was recorded using a PVA membrane containing 80 wt% of PVAm. The water swelling capacity increased when the PVAm content increased, leading to the increment of CO2 permeance. However, the excessive PVAm loading will disrupt the polymer network and reduce mechanical strength. Different from previous works that focused on flat sheet membrane, Li et al. [17] blended PVAm (1 wt%) with PVA (1 wt%) as the coating solution on PSf ultrafiltration hollow fiber membrane. In a two-way coating approach, the coating solution was fed through the lumen from top to bottom, followed by compressed airflow and then in coating solution in the opposite direction. The optimum CO2/CH4 selectivity near 36.6 and CO2 permeance up to 56.3 GPU were recorded under the controlled condition of 0.2 MPa and 25 °C with a feed containing 40 vol% of CO2. The CO2/CH4 selectivity increased drastically when the coating time increased from 0 to 30 min and remained almost constant from 30 to 50 min, but the gas permeance decreased continuously. The CO2/CH4 selectivity and gas permeance also increased when the duration of air blowing extended from 10 to 30 min. The fiber lumen could not be fully opened when the duration of air blowing was controlled below 30 min due to viscous coating solution saturation, resulting in thick and uneven layer formation. The membrane had excellent stability and durability after 540 h of the continuous testing process were carried out at 30 °C with 40% of humidity. (ii) Poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) Poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) was also used to modify PVA membrane for CO2 separation. It contains amino groups at the backbone as well as amino pendant groups. Ben Hamouda et al. [18] fabricated the thick, dense PVA/PEI/PEG membranes. The CO2 permeability of the humidified feed was higher than the CO2 permeability of the dry feed. The CO2 permeability dropped as the partial pressure of CO2 increased, indicating the facilitated transport behavior. The CO2 permeability increased up to 250 Barrer when the PEI content was increased more than 45 wt%, which attributed to the reduction of PVA crystallinity. As the crystallinity reduced, the gas diffusion was improved since the resistance in diffusion pathways of the amorphous region was reduced. The selectivity of PVA/PEG/PEI reached up to 24, which was higher than pure PVA membrane at 1 bar. The separation performance could be stabilized for one week under the continuous feed of humidified gases (20% humidity) at 25 ℃. Lilleby Helberg et al. [19] prepared PVA/PEI/polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) membrane on PSf porous support through dip coating and recorded an increment in water uptake from 63% to 84%. The PVA/PEI/PVP membrane with a low molecular weight of PVP (MW 55,000) was too brittle and cracked easily. Thus, PVP with a molecular weight of 360000 was chosen in this study. The CO2 permeance was increased to 143 GPU when the ratio of PVA to PVP was kept 1:1. When PEI content was adjusted to 50 wt%, the CO2 permeance of 183 GPU with a similar CO2/N2 selectivity (35) was recorded. (iii) PAMAM dendrimer Poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers are hyperbranched polymers containing primary amines. Duan et al. [20] fabricated PAMAM/PVA membrane by casting the blend and cross-linker (di-isopropoxy-bis(triethanol aminato) titanium) on polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) porous support. The cross-linker could react with PVA, but not PAMAM. As the cross-linker concentration increased into the range of 10–25 wt%, the CO2 permeance and the CO2/H2 selectivity increased simultaneously. Similar changes were observed after increasing the temperature from 40° to 60°C. The CO2 permeance decreased, but the CO2/H2 selectivity increased as membrane thickness was increased from 6 to 400 µm. The highest CO2 permeance (3.0 × 10−11 m3 STP·m−2·s−1·Pa−1) and CO2/H2 selectivity (32) were reported under 560 kPa (CO2 partial pressure) and 60 °C. The hydrogen bonding among the –OH groups of PVA and the –NH2 groups of PAMAM was postulated to enhance the separation. Kai et al. [21] immobilized PAMAM dendrimer in PVA membrane as well, but they studied the effects of CO2 partial pressure. The CO2 permeance decreased while He permeance remained nearly constant when the partial pressure was raised from 7 to 24 bar. Hence, the CO2/He selectivity decreased with the increasing of partial pressure as well. Besides solution-diffusion, CO2 permeation was affected by the reaction between CO2 and carbamate or bicarbonate ions before permeation as well as the reverse reaction after permeation. Duan et al. [22] later added amino acids into (PAMAM)/PVA hybrid membrane with di-isopropoxy-bis(triethanol aminato) titanium (Ti) cross-linker. PAMAM and amino acids were added to the PVA solution before cross-linking. After drying for 2 days, the modified PVA film was heated at 40 °C for 1 day and then followed by the heat treatment at 120 °C for 60 min to produce a membrane with a thickness near 400 µm. With 5 wt% of proline, the modified PAMAM/PVA membrane achieved satisfactory CO2 permeance (1.9 × 10−12 m3(STP)·m−2·s−1·Pa−1) and CO2/H2 selectivity (38) at CO2 partial pressure of 560 kPa and 60 °C. Ti cross-linking stabilized the separation performance under pressure. The glycine-modified PAMAM/PVA membrane showed a significant decrease in selectivity as the pressure increased. The decrement might be due to the reduction of pressure durability. In addition, Taniguchi et al. [23] added amine-containing PEG, monothanolamine (MEA) or ethylamine (EA) with PAMAM into PVA membrane. The optimum performance was shown by PVA membrane with amine concentration of 80 wt% (CO2 permeability = 604 Barrer; CO2/H2 selectivity = 58.5). Amines enhanced the CO2 solubility in the membrane, reduced activation energy between amino group and CO2, and promoted the facilitated diffusion of CO2. Unlike other researchers, Duan et al. [24] studied the effects of different cross-linkers (TC-400, TC-310, and T-267) for PVA/PAMAM hybrid membrane. The optimum performance was shown by PVA/PAMAM/TC-400 hybrid membrane, with CO2 permeance of more than 1.0 × 10−10 m3·STP·m−2·s−1·Pa−1 was achieved while its CO2/H2 selectivity was 30 under 560 kPa. TC-400 with ethanol-amino groups promoted CO2 sorption. The CO2 permeance dropped with the increasing CO2 partial pressure due to the reduced CO2 sorption rate at high pressure. The other two types of cross-linkers did not enhance the CO2 permeance, but they reduced the permeance of H2, causing the selectivity of CO2/H2 to increase. (iv) Other polymers with fixed amine carriers Instead of synthetic polymer, biopolymers such as cellulose can be modified to serve as the fixed amine carriers. Saedi et al. [25] synthesized and blended amino-cellulose (AC) into PVA membrane supported by PSf thin film. As proven by XRD results, PVA crystallinity at 2θ = 19.55° was not affected by the presence of AC. However, that blend crystallinity decreased with the increasing polyallylamine content, resulting in higher gas permeance. More importantly, the CO2/CH4 selectivity increased also since the CO2 permeance grew more significant than the CH4 permeance. The gas permeance and selectivity decreased as soon as the feed pressure was ramped from 1 to 10 bar. The PVA membrane with 30 wt% of AC achieved the highest CO2 permeance and CO2/CH4 selectivity, but a reduction in separation performance was detected. The CO2 permeance reduced from about 11–6 GPU, while the CO2/CH4 selectivity dropped from about 105–90. CO2 permeance reduced significantly but not the CH4 permeance once the feed temperature was elevated from 20° to 120°C. The changes caused the CO2/CH4 selectivity to decrease. CO2 permeation involved both facilitated diffusion and solution-diffusion mechanisms. During the facilitated transport of CO2, the kinetic of reversible reaction between CO2 and amine was improved, but the equilibrium constant decreased with the raising feed temperature. CH4 permeation was dominated by solution-diffusion only, and its diffusion was enhanced once the mobility and the free volume of polymer chains increased. In addition to PAMAM dendrimer, Kunalan et al. [26] studied the effects of polyether imine (PETIM) dendrimer on PVA-PEG-GA-polytetrefluoethylene (PTFE) membrane. The addition of 45 wt% PEG increased the CO2 permeance of PVA membrane to 2.0 × 10−9 mol·m−2·s−1·Pa−1, as well as the selectivity to 13. The addition of PEG reduced the crystallinity of PVA, at the same time providing higher fractional free volume. A significant amount of amine groups in dendrimers increased CO2 permeance and CO2/N2 selectivity (33 wt% of PVA, 33 wt% of PEG, 30 wt% of G3 dendrimer, and 4 wt% of GA) to 6.2 × 10−9 mol·m−2·s−1·Pa−1 and 56, respectively."
3,Mobile amine carrier,"2.2 Mobile amine carrier (i) Ethylene amines Besides the long polymer chains with amine groups, the small compounds containing amine groups were further incorporated into some of the PVA membranes, as summarized in Table 3. Fig. 7 shows the difference between fixed and mobile facilitated transportation in PVA membranes. Ethylene amines containing ethylene linkages between amine groups could facilitate the transport of CO2 through PVA membranes. Matsuyama et al. [27] incorporated monoprotonated ethylenediamine (EDAH+) to increase the separation capability of PVA/ poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) membrane. Instead of the conventional blending method, they dipped the membrane into an ethylenediamine solution. The electrostatic force between the EDAH+ and PAA could prevent the leaching of the amine carrier. The modified PVA/PAA membrane achieved CO2/N2 selectivity of more than 1900. Moreover, the modified membrane showed greater ion-exchange capacity (4.5 meq/g) than Nafion 117 membrane (0.91 meq/g). As the ion exchange capacity grew, the CO2 permeance and CO2/N2 selectivity elevated. Both CO2 and N2 permeability decreased, but the selectivity grew when the annealing temperature rose from 120 to 150 ℃. The permeability reduction can be attributed to the decrease in solvent content in the membrane. The membrane swelled less at the higher temperature, causing a decline in gas diffusivity. Mondal and Mandal [28] also added fixed and mobile amine carriers into PVA/PVP membrane on PSf support. Two types of amine carriers, namely PEI and pentaethylenehexamine (PEHA), were incorporated to facilitate CO2 transport. The CO2 permeability was low under the high feed pressure (3.5–6.5 atm) due to the absence of free amine groups for facilitating CO2 permeation. On the other hand, the gas permeation was controlled by the solution-diffusion under the high feed pressure. The PVA/PVP membrane with 25 wt% PEHA and 15 wt% PEI only showed an increment of CO2 permeability to 1474 Barrer and CO2/N2 selectivity up to 409 when the water flow rate at the sweep side was increased from 0.02 to 0.075 cm3/min. Mondal and Mandal [29] also added PEI and tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) into PVA/PVP membrane. The PVA/PVP membrane with 60 mol% cross-linking degree, 25 wt% TEPA and 15 wt% showed the maximum CO2 permeance (29 GPU) and CO2/N2 selectivity (270) at 100 ℃ and 2.8 atm. After raising the feed pressure, the gas permeance and selectivity dropped. The gas permeance and selectivity only improved when the water flow rate at the sweep side increased. Humidity and temperature also affected the separation performance as they influenced the water content for CO2 facilitated transport. Mondal et al. [30] further evaluated the effects of PEHA and AHPD as the mobile amine carriers on the PVA/PVP/PAAn membrane. The small AHPD resulted in a more noteworthy improvement of the CO2 permeance (42 GPU) and CO2/N2 selectivity (437) compared to the long PEHA with more amine groups. (ii)Amino acid and salts. Amino acid and salts are CO2 absorbents with low evaporation and degradation concerns. Yegani et al. [31] incorporated 2,3-diaminopropionic acid (DAPA) when fabricating PVA/PAA co-polymer gel. The facilitated transport membrane was fabricated by coating the PTFE support with the co-polymer gel/DAPA solution. By increasing the DAPA concentration up to 80 wt%, the CO2 permeance and CO2/N2 selectivity were improved but resulted in a less stable membrane. The membrane containing 80 wt% of DAPA exhibited high CO2 permeance (2 × 10−4 mol·m−2·s−1·kPa−1) and CO2/N2 selectivity (700) at 160 °C and 6 bar. The CO2 permeance and CO2/N2 selectivity increased when the feed pressure increased from 1.5 bar to 60 bar, suggesting that the carrier was still not saturated at high pressure. As the temperature increased to 160 ℃, the gas humidity and water content in the membrane were lowered, thus reducing the reaction rate between DAPA and CO2. However, the CO2 permeance increased within at low-temperature region (50–130 ℃) under 100% humidity. Huang et al. [32] blended 2-aminoisobutyric acid potassium salt (AIBA-K) and PAAn into the cross-linked PVA thin film on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) substrate. The CO2/N2 selectivity increased to 493 while the CO2 permeability increased to 6196 Barrer at 110 °C. Both permeability and selectivity decreased as the temperature was further rose to 120 °C. The decrement of CO2 facilitated transportation was caused by the reducing water content. The CO2 dry concentration in permeate higher than 98% was recorded when steam was used to sweep the permeate. As the molar ratio of sweep to feed increased, the recovery of CO2 increased due to the improved driving force. The simulation results indicated that it is possible to recover 95% CO2 with a dry concentration higher than 98% from a flue gas containing 9% CO2. Similarly, Xing and Ho [33] added the free amine carriers (AIBA-K and KHCO3-K2CO3) as well as the fixed amine carriers (PAAn and aminosilane modified fumed silica) into the cross-linked PVA-polysiloxane membrane on PSf support. The CO2 permeability and CO2/H2 selectivity were improved with the rising temperature up to 107 °C. The increment was caused by the increased reaction rate between amine groups and CO2. The CO2 permeance decreased when the PVA cross-linking degree increased due to the drop of diffusivity inside the cross-linking network. When the humidity of sweep gas was elevated, the CO2 permeance and the CO2/H2 selectivity raised to 104 GPU (2901 Barrer) and 138.3, respectively. Dai et al. [34] dip-coated the PPO hollow fiber with PVA/amino acid salts solution. Various types of amino acid salts, such as potassium cysteinate (CysK), potassium prolinate (ProK), potassium glycinate (GlyK), and potassium argininate (ArgK)were investigated in their work. Among the amino acid salts, the ProK was the most effective amino acid salt. The blending of 40% of ProK into PVA membrane increased the CO2 permeance up to 791 GPU, which corresponds to 98% enhancement over pure PVA membrane. Amino acid salts promoted the transport and permeance of CO2 but did not significantly affect the CO2/N2 selectivity around 40. The PVA membranes containing amino acid salt also demonstrated satisfactory thermal stability while the membrane performance remained stable for a 20-h test. Dai et al. [35] subsequently prepared PVA/40 wt% proline (ProK) hybrid hollow fiber membrane in a pre-pilot scale setup. The optimized PVA/ProK membrane could achieve CO2 permeance up to 800 GPU and a CO2/N2 selectivity of 40. The CO2 flux increased at the range of temperature from 80° to 100°C, but decreased at a temperature over 100 ℃. The high temperature could increase the rate of reaction, but at the same time, reducing the humidity in the membrane, which further reducing CO2 diffusion. The permeation test using real flue gas revealed that the membrane performance was not significantly affected by the gas impurities. However, the CO2 flux decreased when the test period was extended to 6 days which could be attributed to fouling by fly ash, the oxidation of CO2 carrier and the presence of acidic component in the feed gas. (iii)Alkanolamine. Alkanolamines with both hydroxyl and amino groups on their alkane backbone have been identified as the potential absorbent owing to their neutralizing properties [36]. Amooghin et al. [37] cross-linked amine-mediated PVA membrane on PTPE support. Alkanolamines, diethanolamine (DEA) and monoethanolamine (MEA) were used as the mobile carriers. The overall membrane capability of the PVA/DEA membrane was better than PVA/MEA membrane. DEA achieved a high reverse reaction rate and facilitated the CO2 separation from the amine groups effectively. The highest gas separation performance was shown by 15 wt% DEA/PVA membrane cross-linked with 1 wt% of glutaraldehyde (GA). A CO2/N2 selectivity of 122.04 was recorded for pure gas feed, and 907.06 was reported for mixed gas feed. The high selectivity resulted from the high cross-linking density of the membrane with reduced swelling and increased compact structure. The stability test revealed that the membrane maintained performance up to 700 h. GA cross-linking can prevent the amine carrier leach out of the membrane. Similarly, Zamani Pedram et al. [38] synthesized PVA/DEA membrane on the hydrophilized PTFE microporous support. The PVA/DEA membrane cross-linked with GA (1 wt%) showed the maximum CO2/CH4 selectivity of 665 with CO2 permeance lower than 0.12 × 10−6 cm3(STP)·cm−2·cmHg−1·s−1 for a mixed gas feed. The high concentration of GA resulted in a viscous coating solution, which eventually formed a CO2 selective membrane with reduced gas transport resistance. CO2 was separated more effectively at higher partial pressure because the membrane could work as the facilitating medium. The performance was mostly affected by concentration of CO2-DEA. (a) Piperazine Piperazine is an organic solvent with a hexagonal ring containing 2 opposing nitrogen atoms. Barooah and Mandal [39] coated PES support with PVA/piperazine glycinate (PG)/ZIF-8 solution to produce mixed matrix membranes. The CO2 permeance of 86 GPU and CO2/N2 selectivity of 370 was achieved using PVA/PG membrane containing ZIF-8 (5 wt%). Compared to the neat PVA membrane, it corresponds to 82% and 76% improvement in CO2 permeance and selectivity, respectively. The PG salt served as the mobile carrier to facilitate the CO2 transport while the ZIF-8 particles could disrupt the packing of the polymer chain, which increased the free volume and gas diffusion. Moreover, the ZIF-8 particles separated the CO2 with a smaller size of molecules via molecular sieving, causing the increases in selectivity. Taniguchi et al. [40] immobilized piperazine(Pz)-in the PVA/amines membrane on the porous PVDF support. The membrane containing 3-(1-piperazinyl)− 1,2-propanediol (PzPD) allowed CO2 permeation at 1060 Barrer with a CO2/CH4 selectivity of 370 under 50 °C, 11 kPa and 90% relative humidity (RH). PzPD owns two hydroxyl groups and also a secondary amino group from Pz ring to interact with CO2. The interaction between the secondary amino groups and CO2 led to carbamate formation. Carbamate was hydrolyzed and formed bicarbonate ions. Hydroxyl group from PzPD facilitated CO2 and amine interaction through hydrogen bonding, thus enhancing CO2 diffusion. (b) Ionic liquid Ionic liquids (ILs) are organic salts that appear in the form of liquid at room temperature. They show negligible volatility and great affinity for CO2. Klepić et al. [41] blended 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium dicyanamide ([EMIM][DCA]) into PVA solution and spin-coated the mixture on a stainless steel plate. The IL was trapped by the capillary forces within the pores of PVA membrane, and it improved the mechanical stability of PVA membrane at high temperature. The optimum separation performance was observed when 53 wt% of IL was blended into PVA membrane, achieving CO2 permeability of 66.9 Barrer and CO2/H2 selectivity of 7.73. The gas permeability and selectivity increased drastically when the content of [EMIM][DCA] increased after 24 wt%. The drastic increment could be related to a drastic increase of CO2 diffusivity since IL blending created an amorphous phase in the semi-crystalline polymer. Klepić et al. [42] blended 53 wt% of [EMIM][DCA] ionic liquid (IL) into PVA solution (10 wt%) before drying into a CO2 separation membrane. The CO2 permeability increased (< 80 Barrer), but the CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 selectivity reduced (< 60) with the increasing temperature as expected. The incorporation of IL enhanced the CO2 sorption capacity and membrane stability but did not raise the separation performance beyond Robeson upper bound. Alcantara et al. [43] studied PVA/cellulose acetate membrane with the addition of N-methyl-2-hydroxyethyl ammonium propionate ([m-2HEA][Pr]), which is an alkanolamine and carboxylic acid-based IL. The PVA/CA membrane with 45.5 wt% IL achieved an optimum CO2 permeability (26 Barrer), CO2/CH4 selectivity (122), and CO2/ N2 selectivity (213). The IL with high CO2 affinity and larger empty spaces volume promoted CO2 solubility. The IL with [F]- and [Ac]- anions also promoted chemical reactions with CO2. The CO2 permeability raised to 40.0 Barrer, the CO2/CH4 selectivity raised to 21.7, and CO2/ N2 raised to 40.8 as the IL loading was increased to 60.3 wt%."
4,Hydrophilic polymers,"2.3 Hydrophilic polymers (i)Poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) POEM. Besides the amine rich polymers and compounds, hydrophilic polymers were blended into PVA membranes as listed in Table 4. The hydrophilic poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) (POEM) is frequently grafted as a co-polymer to increase the moiety content of different polymers. Taniguchi et al. [44] spin-coated PVA solution containing POEM-g-polyoxyethylene (POE) co-polymer on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) support. Controlling the coating thickness around 15 µm, the highest CO2 permeability of 1470 Barrer and CO2/N2 selectivity of 24.5 were attained. A low POE methacrylate (POEM) content (24 wt%) caused the low CO2 solubility and subsequently low permeability. The dense POE comb graft resulted in high flexibility for CO2 diffusion. Afterward, Kim et al. [45] prepared a CO2 membrane from PVA grafted with amorphous POEM. PVA-g-POEM co-polymers with varied POEM content were prepared through free radical polymerization using ceric ammonium nitrate as the initiator. The polymer solution was subsequently cast on poly[1-(trimethylsilyl)- 1-propyne] modified PSf support. The optimum performance was recorded for PVA-g-POEM membrane with 64 wt% content of POEM. The CO2 permeance reached up to 347.3 GPU while the CO2/N2 selectivity of raised to 21.6. The CO2 permeance increased continuously from less than 0.1–406.6 as the POEM content was raised from 0% to 100%. The presence of polar and oxygen groups in POEM chains could enhance CO2 acid-base interaction, which is the key to higher CO2 uptake. However, POEM reduced the crystallinity of the membrane while increasing chain mobility. The gas diffusion was increased, including N2. causing the drop of CO2/N2 selectivity. The membrane made of POEM without PVA showed a CO2/N2 selectivity of 4.0, lower than PVA-g-POEM membranes. Furthermore, Kim et al. [46] blended PVA-g-poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) (POEM) co-polymer with diethylenetriamine (DETA) to form dope solution for film casting on polysulfone membrane. The free-radical polymerization method was adopted to synthesis PVA-g-POEM graft polymer. The formation of hydrogen bonds was observed as DETA was added, and three absorption bands (3277, 1595 and 1456 cm−1) could be observed on IR spectra. The DETA loading of more than 10 wt% reduced the separation capability of PVA-g-POEM/DETA as CO2 solubility was reduced. The optimum separation in this study (CO2 permeance = 402.5 GPU; CO2/N2 selectivity = 52.1) could be maintained within two weeks. The amine carrier, DETA caused the positive interaction between its amino groups and functional groups from the graft co-polymer, increased membrane stability. DETA affected PVA chain crystallinity at low loading, resulting in N2 permeance reduction. (ii)Sodium polyacrylate (PAANa). Sodium polyacrylate (PAANa) is a renowned super-absorbent polymer that is able to absorb water more than 100 times of its mass. Ito et al. [47] prepared CO2 selective layer on PES support from the blend of PVA and PAANa. Amine carriers such as PAMAM dendrimer and PAAn were then added to study their effects on membrane separation performances. PVA worked as the gas barrier, while PAANa functioned as a water absorber. The PVA with a polymerization degree of 2000 showed the highest water absorption. When it was blended with PAANa at a ratio of 44: 56, the CO2 permeance raised to 8.58 × 10−12 m3·m−2·s−1·Pa−1 and the CO2/He selectivity was only 1.65. As the dendrimers were added, the gas permeation was greatly improved. CO2 permeance of 1.03 × 10−11 m3·m−2·s−1·Pa−1 and CO2/He selectivity of 6.17 were attained using PAMAM. The existence of amino groups enhanced the separation significantly. The carbonate coating improved membrane performance, reaching CO2 permeance of 5.05 × 10−11 m3·m−2·s−1·Pa−1 and CO2/He selectivity of 57. Following the previous study, Ito et al. [48] incorporated PAANa or PVA into a cross-linked acrylic acid polymer sodium salt (SANFRESH ST-500MPSA) to produce a CO2 selective membrane through blending or bilayer coating on PES substrate. The water absorptivity of PAANa was highest, followed by SANFRESH and PVA. Thus, PAANa/SANFRESH bilayer membrane showed higher water absorption and CO2 separation performance than PVA/SANFRESH bilayer membrane. PAANa/SANFRESH bilayer membrane achieved CO2 permeance of 9.35 × 10−11 m3·m−2·s−1·Pa−1 and CO2/He selectivity of 144.1, while PVA/SANFRESH bilayer membrane achieved CO2 permeance of 6.73 × 10−12 m3·m−2·s−1·Pa−1 and CO2/He selectivity of 123.9 at 0.1 MPa. At 0.7 MPa, both CO2 permeance and CO2/He selectivity reduced drastically. The PVA/SANFRESH membrane performed better than the bilayer membrane, achieving CO2 permeance near 4.96 × 10−11 m3·m−2·s−1·Pa−1 and selectivity of 135.4. Water absorbing agents were essential to increase water absorption for the facilitated transportation of CO2. Blending two commercial water absorbents, Ito et al. [49] found that PVA/AQUALIC/SANFRESH membrane attained the CO2 permeance of 1.49 × 10−10 m3 (STP)·m−2·s−1·Pa−1, higher than the CO2 permeance of PVA/AQUALIC membrane (5.18 × 10−11 m3 (STP)·m−2·s−1·Pa−1). The amine-based additives enhanced the separation performance under humidification at 0.7 MPa. With the addition of amine base additives on PVA/AQUALIC/SANFRESH membrane, the CO2 permeance reached up to 1.39 × 10−10 m3·STP·m−2·s−1·Pa−1 and the CO2/He selective raised to 190.6. The addition of amine-based additives resulted in the reduction of membrane thickness but increment of water absorption. However, Ito et al. [50] still found that the separation capability of PVA/SANFRESH and PVA/PAANa membrane was higher than PVA/AQUALIC membrane at 0.1 MPa 60 °C. The CO2 permeance in the range of 2.27 – 2.36 × 10−10 m3 (STP)·m−2·s−1·Pa−1 and the CO2/He selectivity between 516.2 and 522.4 were reported. The latter membrane only achieved CO2 permeance of 1.37 × 10−10 with CO2/He selectivity of 190.2 due to the difference in water absorption degree. (iii) Nanocellulose. Cellulose is a long polymer chain that can be isolated into cellulose nanofiber (CNF) and cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) through mechanical and/or chemical processing. Besides the high moiety content, CNF and CNC possess excellent mechanical properties that qualify them as reinforcement agents. Hence, they have been extensively added to different types of membranes [51]. Jahan et al. [52] prepared PVA/CNC membranes by adding nanocellulose to 2 wt% of PVA solution before casting on PSf support. The best membrane performance was shown by PVA membrane with 1% CNC at pH 10, achieving the CO2 permeance of 0.29 m3(STP)·m−2·h−1·bar−1 and the CO2/CH4 selectivity of 43. CNC addition resulted in higher separation performance because it could increase the membrane swelling degree and enhance the free volume for gas diffusion. CO2 has higher solubility in water compared to CH4, resulting in the high CO2/CH4 selectivity in the swollen membrane. The selectivity dropped to 31, and while the permeability dropped to 0.11 m3(STP)·m−2·h−1·bar−1 as the feed pressure increased from 5 bar to 15 bar. When the feed pressure increased, the absolute water vapor content in the feed gas stream was reduced. Jahan et al. [53] further investigated the influence of CNC loading and coating thickness on the separation of CO2/CH4 mixture using PVA membrane. As the loading of CNC increased beyond 1.5 wt%, the moisture uptake of the membrane decreased. Thus, the gas permeance and selectivity decreased as well. When the feed pressure was raised from 5 bar to 15 bar, the CO2/CH4 selectivity and CO2 permeance of 1.5 wt% of CNC membrane decreased to 31 and 0.11 m3(STP)·m−2·h−1·bar−1, respectively. They suggested that the plasticization occurred besides the water loss at high pressure, causing the performance to drop. Dai et al. [54] compared PVA/CNC and PVA/CNF membranes in their study. PVA was blended with CNF or CNC before dip coating on poly(p-phenylene oxide) hollow fiber membrane. PVA/CNC performed better membrane than PVA/CNF membrane. CO2 permeance of 672 GPU and a CO2/N2 selectivity of 43.6 was recorded using PVA membrane blended with 80 wt% of CNC. The PVA membrane with CNF content raised from 0 wt% to 80 wt% showed low CO2 permeance, only increased to 413 GPU. Compared to CNF, CNC enhanced the water swelling and kept the optimum uptake of water more significantly due to its rod shape within the nano range. The CO2/N2 selectivity was greatly improved because of the existence of hydrophilic gas transport paths on the outer surface of CNC. Torstensen et al. [51] also reported similar results when comparing PVA/CNC and PVA/phosphorylated CNF (P-CNF) membranes for CO2/N2 separation at 0.2 bar. PVA/CNC membrane exhibited a higher CO2/N2 separation factor of 39 ± 0.4 and CO2 permeance of 127.8 ± 5.5 GPU. With the smaller size, CNC dispersed better in PVA membrane for creating more transport pathways for CO2 molecules. Jahan et al. [55] concluded that coating solution pH should be adjusted during the synthesis of PVA/P-CNF membranes. Comparing the membranes fabricated with 1% P-CNF at pH 5, 9 and 12, the membrane fabricated at pH 12 achieved the maximum CO2 permeance because the number of free protons to react with CO2 increased. The equilibrium was driven to carbonate formation, causing more CO2 to dissociate into bicarbonate ions and permeate through the membrane. A CO2/CH4 selectivity more than 44 and CO2 permeance near to 0.21 m3(STP)·m−2·h−1·bar−1 were reported. Helberg et al. [56] incorporated phosphorylated cellulose nanofibrils (P-CNF) with high charge and/or screened size into PVA solution to form a composite membrane on PSf ultrafiltration membrane. P-CNF with high charge and screened sized possesses more hydrophilic surface and could enhance CO2 facilitated transport. PVA/P-CNF membrane attained a CO2 permeability of 117 Barrer and CO2/ N2 selectivity of 46. In addition, Janakiram et al. [57] functionalized the microfibrillated cellulose with poly(ethylene) glycol (MFC-PEG) before blending into sterically hindered polyallylamine (SHPAA)/PVA membranes with ultrathin structure (300 nm thickness). The SHAPAA/PVA blend membrane with 30 wt% MFC-PEG demonstrated CO2 permeance up to 652 GPU and a CO2/N2 selectivity of about 41. The CO2 permeance was enhanced by more than 50% by adding MFC-PEG. The addition of nanocellulose could disrupt the hydrogen bonding and affect the cross-linking of PVA surrounding the fibrils. The membrane swelling was enhanced, leading to the increase in small molecules diffusion. The sorption kinetics was improved, and more water molecules diffused into PVA. (iv)Other hydrophilic polymers. Polydopamine (PDA) has been widely used to form hydrophilic coatings on different substrates. Wu et al. [58] spin-coated PVA-PDA membrane on PES support. The mixed gas of CO2/CH4 (30 wt%/70 wt%) could be separated at a selectivity of 43.2, 43.85% more than the selectivity of the neat PVA membrane. The CO2/CH4 selectivity increased to 43.8 as the PDA content increased to 0.5 wt%, but the CO2 permeance almost maintained constant around 17.2 GPU. The cross-linking around PDA nano-aggregates minimized the larger size gas molecules diffusion for the selectivity improvement. Hydrogen bonding formed between amino or catechol groups from PDA with hydroxyl groups from PVA. PDA resulted in an amorphous structure which allows the formation of more water channels in those hydrogel membranes."
5,Carbonaceous materials,"2.4 Carbonaceous materials (i)Carbon nanotube (CNT). Besides facilitated transport, CO2 separation could be improved by increasing gas diffusion through the swollen PVA membrane. Hence, carbonaceous nanoparticles were incorporated to improve membrane swelling for CO2 diffusion as summarized in Table 5. Deng and Hägg [59] added CNTs into PVA/PVAm thin film supported by PSf ultrafiltration membrane. Due to the improvement of membrane swelling by CNT addition, they reported on the highest CO2 permeance of 0.35 m3(STP)·m−2·h−1·bar−1 and CO2/CH4 selectivity of 45 under 2 bar. A low concentration of CNTs (1.0 wt%) could also result in significant improvement of mechanical strength because they provided laminated structures, which uniformized the stress applied. He et al. [60] further introduced heat treatment of PVA/PVAm film coated on PSf ultrafiltration membrane after blending with CNTs. The CO2/CH4 selectivity near to 24 and CO2 permeance as much as 0.22 m3(STP)·m−2·h−1·bar−1 were reported even without sweep gas after heat treatment at 95 °C for 45 min. However, the reduction of humidity in the feed gas at high pressure (> 20 bar) still caused the CO2 permeability and CO2/CH4 selectivity to reduce. Differently, Saeed and Deng [61] embedded CNTs into the thin and dense PVA-mimic enzyme membrane. The PVA membrane incorporated with 1.0 wt% of CNTs at pH 12 achieved the CO2 permeance of 0.98 m3(STP)·m−2·h−1·bar−1and CO2/N2 selectivity of 120, nearly 30% of improvement in comparison to neat PVA membrane. Increasing the pH of PVA solution from 5 to 12 could improve the CO2 permeance by about 25%. The membrane swelling was enhanced, leading to more free volume for CO2 permeation. With the increasing CNTs loading from 0 wt% to 1.0 wt%, the CO2 permeance increased while the CO2/N2 selectivity decreased slightly. CNTs improved the capacity of water swelling which enhanced CO2 facilitated transport. Saeed et al. [62] used the hydrophilic multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) as the fixed amine carrier in PVA membrane. The PVA composite membrane with 1 wt% of MWCNTs prepared at pH 12 demonstrated the maximum CO2 permeance (0.44 m3(STP)·m−2·h−1·bar−1) and CO2/N2 selectivity (60). This is because the gas diffusion was greatly enhanced when the membrane attained the greatest improvement in swelling, up to 256%. (ii)Graphene. As a popular reinforced nanomaterial, graphene oxide (GO) with planary structure was further used to improved PVA membrane. Ebrahimi et al. [63] developed PES/amine-functionalized graphene oxide (AFGO) support for the formation of PVA membrane. The PES/AFGO membrane was first prepared through the phase inversion method, followed by PVA coating on the membrane surface to seal the defects. Simultaneously, CO2 permeability and CO2/CH4 selectivity were improved as the filler loading was raised to 10 wt%. The enhancement in PES/AFGO MMMs performance is greater than PES/GO MMMs since the amine group in AFGO can react with CO2 via zwitterion mechanism. Permeability of CO2 decreased when the pressure was elevated from 50 kPa to 400 kPa due to the glassy property of the polymer and dual sorption phenomenon. To understand the effects of GO on the PVA membrane, Janakiram et al. [64] incorporated GO with different functional groups into the PVA membrane. The CO2 permeance of the neat PVA membrane dropped from 240 GPU by incorporating 0.2 wt% GO or porous GO, but the CO2/N2 selectivity maintained almost constant. With PEG coupled GO, the CO2 permeance and CO2/N2 selectivity of PVA membrane increased up to 285 GPU and 49, respectively. The 2D structure of GO limited the facilitated transport, but it could be reduced using porous GO. In addition to PEG coupling, CO2 facilitated transport was affected by amine groups in the sterically hindered polyallylamin (SHPAA) blended into PVA membrane. The CO2/N2 selectivity increased up to 90 using SHPAA/PVA/GO-PEG membrane, while the CO2 permeance of SHPAA/PVA/porous GO membrane raised to 607 GPU. Furthermore, Nigiz et al. [65] developed a PVA/graphene nanoplate (GNP) dense membrane for the CO2 separation from CH4. After blending GNP into PVA solution and casting into thin films, the dried films were cross-linked using glutaraldehyde to form PVA/GNP membranes. The tensile stress was increased to 47.70 MPa as shown by PVA membrane with 1.5 wt% graphene loading. Further increment of GNP content induced filler agglomeration and resulted in a reduction of tensile stress. The crystallinity of the PVA membrane reduced as shown by the differential scanning calorimetry results. The membrane with 1.5 wt% graphene loading attained the highest CO2 permeability (81.45 Barrer) and CO2/CH4 selectivity (41.9). The blending of GNP caused a slight drop in CO2 permeability but a rise of CO2/CH4 selectivity. The tortuous pathway was increased, and CH4 diffusion was limited due to its large molecule size."
6,Inorganic particles,"2.5 Inorganic particles (i)Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS). Inorganic particles were also added into PVA membranes to obtain hybrid properties as summarized in Table 6. Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) is a hybrid nanomaterial with a chemical composition of RSiO1.5. POSS with nanocage structure connecting different functional groups are available for chemical modification besides improving the mechanical properties. Guerrero et al. [66] blended amino or amidino functionalized POSS nanoparticles into PVA before dip coating on polyphenylene oxide support. PVA/amino-POSS and PVA/Amidino-POSS membranes exhibited similar CO2/N2 selectivity around 40, but the latter achieved higher CO2 permeability of 0.71 m3(STP)·m−2·h−1·bar−1. Nevertheless, POSS addition did not provide much advantageous effect compared to the neat PVA membrane. It was suggested that the interaction between the nanoparticles and polymer has resulted in negative effects that did not improve the CO2 permeance. Besides that, amino and amidino-POSS did not demonstrate carrier transport in the membrane. Guerrero et al. [67] added amine-functionalized POSS (amine-POSS) into PVA dope solution before dip coating on PSf membrane. The controlled sol-gel process was used to prepare amine-POSS, which produces cage structures through hydrolysis of 3-amino-propytriethoxy-silane (APS). The CO2 permeance of PVA-amine-POSS membranes was positively influenced by humidity. The highest CO2 permeance at 100% RH was achieved when the concentration of amine-POSS was adjusted around 45 wt%. The CO2/N2 selectivity at 100% RH was limited to about 60. However, the CO2/N2 selectivity at 75% RH could increase from 51 to 120 as the amino-POSS content was increased from 0 to 5 wt%. More importantly, the membrane could recover from SO2 plasticization. In a comparison study, Guerrero et al. [68] cast PVA solution (3 wt%) containing amidino-POSS or lactamide-POSS on PSf support to form CO2 selective membranes. PVA membrane showed better separation performance (CO2 permeability ~70 Barrer, CO2/N2 selectivity ~ 40) compared to PVA membranes incorporated with amidino-POSS or Lactamide-POSS. Solution-diffusion remained dominant since the increasing feed pressure raised the CO2 dissolution in the membrane but caused the saturation of carriers for CO2 facilitated transportation. Moreover, CO2 permeability decreased as the crystallinity degree increased in the modified PVA membrane. (ii)Other inorganic particles. Zeolites are popular aluminosilicate crystals with well-defined microporous structure for catalysis and adsorption. Xing and Ho [69] synthesized a thin film composite containing cross-linked PVA, PEG, and zeolite 5 A. The membrane with 64 wt% of PEG (MW 200) exhibited a CO2 permeability of 80.2 Barrer and CO2/CH4 selectivity of 33 at 30 °C. By increasing the cross-linking time to 84 min, the selectivity was increased to 33. However, the CO2/CH4 decreased as the cross-linking duration was extended beyond 84 min. The longer cross-linking duration resulted in more loss of the hydroxyl group, causing a decrease in selectivity. On the contrary, the extension of cross-linking duration to 120 min restricted the chain mobility, which caused the CO2 permeability to decrease from 187.3 to 74.3 Barrer. Meanwhile, the selectivity decreased as the loading of Zeolite 5A was raised up to 58 wt% due to the interfacial defect formation. The CO2 permeability decreased at first but started to increase once the zeolite loading reached 33.2 wt%. The zeolite pore blockage phenomenon was suggested to explain the initial decrease in CO2 permeability. Both unfilled and zeolite 5A-filled membrane showed CO2 permeability enhancement in the temperature range of 16.4–40 °C. However, the selectivity dropped since the polymer chain is more flexible at a higher temperature, resulting in higher gas diffusivity. Zinc oxide (ZnO) interacts with CO2 catalytically and valuable chemicals, including methanol can be produced through thermal, electrochemical and photochemical hydrogenation. However, it was mainly used as the inorganic filler that enhances the free volume of PVA based membrane. Dilshad et al. [70] fabricated the ZnO filled PVA/PEG blend membrane by regulating the ZnO content in the membrane (0.5–4 wt%). The membrane thickness in this study was 100–250 µm. As the content of ZnO increased up to 2 wt%, both the CO2 permeability and CO2/N2 selectivity improved since the presence of ZnO particles may enhance the free volume, which provides more transport pathways for the gas molecules. Moreover, the ZnO can interact with CO2 molecules which contribute to selectivity improvement. However, the membrane performance has decreased after addition 4 wt% of ZnO due to agglomeration issue. The optimum CO2 permeability of 423 Barrers and CO2/N2 selectivity of 112.8 were obtained for the PVA/PEG membrane with 2 wt% ZnO under 25 °C and 1.5 bar. Similar to ZnO, silica was loaded into PVA based membrane to alter the free volume of PVA based membrane for CO2 permeation. Barooah and Mandal [71] cross-linked PVA/PEG mixed matrix membrane after adding silica nanoparticles, but before adding amine carries such as PEI and triethylenetetramine (TETA). The incorporation of 3.34 wt% silica loading into PVA/PEG membrane has improved the CO2 permeability from 400 to 710 Barrer, while the CO2/N2 selectivity increased from 210 to 300. In comparison to the neat PVA/PEG membrane, the CO2/N2 selectivity and CO2 permeability of PVA/PEG-3.34 wt% silica membrane at 100 °C increased 30.5% and 75%, respectively. The CO2 permeability of PVA/PEG-3.34 wt% was also increased by 250% when the flow rate of sweep side water increased from 0.02 to 0.075 mL/min. The addition of silica enhanced the thermal and gas transport properties due to the strong interaction between silica and polymer matrix. The presence of silica fillers disrupted the polymer packing, which increases the gas permeability. Ceramics such as alumina (Al2O3) with hydrophilic properties can be used to improve the moiety content in PVA membranes. Dilshad et al. [72] synthesized a thick, dense cross-linked PVA/PEG membrane embedded with Al2O3 particles. As the alumina content increased from 0 wt% to 6 wt%, the CO2 permeability increased from 52.9 to 394 Barrer because of the increased free volume of the polymer after alumina addition. Meanwhile, the CO2/N2 selectivity was enhanced from 26 to 79.81 since the OH-groups on alumina surface can interact with polar CO2 molecules. However, increasing the alumina loading beyond 6 wt% could reduce the membrane performance due to filler agglomeration. The increase of permeability from 394 to 795 Barrer and decrease of selectivity from 79.81 to 40.77 were observed as the temperature was increased from 25° to 100°C. The temperature increment promoted the mobility of polymer chain and thus, improved the permeability. However, the gas solubility decreased at high temperature which caused the reduction in selectivity. The membrane containing 6 wt% of Al2O3 exhibited the optimum performance which corresponds to 394 Barrer (CO2 permeability) and CO2/N2 selectivity of 79.8 at 1.5 bar and 25 ℃."
7,Polyether block amide (PEBA),"2.6 Polyether block amide (PEBA) PEBAX is the trade name of polyether block amide (PEBA). This thermoplastic elastomer has been used to develop CO2 separation membranes due to its favorable selectivity in acid gas separation. Wong et al. [73] blended PVA and PEBAX before casting over the porous PSf support. Glutaric dialdehyde was added to cross-link PVA. The membrane with PVA:PEBAX ratio at 2:3 showed the optimum performance, achieving CO2 permeability of 20 Barrer and CO2/H2 selectivity of 7.6. The introduction of PEBAX reduced mass transfer resistance through the formation of a flexible polymer network. Kheirtalab et al. [74] prepared PEBAX/PVA/graphene oxide (GO) MMM. By addition 5 wt% of PVA into PEBAX, CO2 permeability decreased due to the increased PEBAX crystallinity. The CO2 permeability was then increased to 96.85 Barrer after raising PVA content to 20 wt%. The interaction between the electron donor (-OH) from PVA and the electron receiver Helberg et al. [75] from CO2 promoted CO2 transport through the membrane. PEBAX/PVA (10 wt%) membrane with 6 wt% GO reached CO2 permeance of 236.48 Barrer, and CO2/CH4 selectivity of 33.63. By increasing PVA content to 15 wt%, a high CO2 permeability (228.34 Barrer) and CO2/N2 selectivity (124.09) were recorded. Unlike PVA, GO enhanced membrane performance by affecting the degree of crystallinity and intermolecular interactions."
8,Conclusions,"Besides the fixed and mobile amine carriers, PVA-based membranes were incorporated with a wide range of additives to improve their moiety content, swelling degree, and other properties for the facilitated transport of CO2. They are further compared in Fig. 8, and many of them surpassed the upper bound of the Robeson plot. Among these additives, amine carriers and inorganic additives seem promising CO2 gas permeability at the same time showing higher CO2/ N2 and CO2/ CH4 selectivity. The new findings on the amine carriers and other additives are listed below. 1. PVAm, PEI, and PAMAM dendrimers were the fixed amine carriers commonly used in PVA membranes for CO2 facilitated transport. After homogeneous mixing and coating with the fixed amine carriers, the PVA membranes were cross-linked for 1 h within 90–120 °C. PVAm concentration in PVA membranes was controlled in the range of 1–5% or adjusted to the ratio of PVAm to PVA at 1:1 t. Meanwhile, PEG or PVP was added together with PEI into PVA membranes. PAMAM could be blended in the cross-linked PVA using Ti cross-linker. However, PVA membranes with the fixed amine carriers only showed unsatisfactory separation performance. 2. The addition of mobile amine carriers, including ethylene amines, amino acid, amino acid salts, alkanolamine, piperazine, and ionic liquid, into PVA membranes were reported. AIBA-K and PEHA not only increased the CO2 permeance but also improved the gas selectivity. Formaldehyde was usually utilized as the cross-linking agent in PVA membranes with amine carriers to decrease membrane swelling. Amino acid salts enhanced the CO2 permeance of the PVA membrane more significantly, while DEA improved gas selectively more effectively. Piperazine enhanced both gas permeance and selectivity, but ionic liquids could only provide additional mechanical stability. PVA membranes with both fixed and mobile amine carriers could attain the CO2 separation performance that exceeds the upper boundary of the Robeson plot. 3. Hydrophilic polymers such as POEM, PAANa and nanocellulose were incorporated into PVA membranes to improve the moiety content. POEM worked as the plasticizer to interact with polar groups of PVA and increased the free volume at high pressure. N2 permeance increased, causing the gas selectivity to drop. PAANa was incorporated with the commercial water-absorbent such as SANFRESH, but they only improved gas selectivity. The non-toxic and biodegradable nanocellulose, especially CNC could improve membrane performance besides its mechanical strength. 4. A low concentration of CNT could improve the mechanical strength of PVA membrane. However, the GO functionalized with amine and carboxylic acid groups offered more opportunities to improve CO2 permeability and gas selectivity simultaneously. 5. Among the inorganic additives, POSS with different functional groups had been extensively studied to improve PVA membranes. However, POSS showed less encouraging results than other inorganic particles such as ZnO, silica, and alumina, which promoted the CO2 separation beyond the Robeson boundary. Interfacial defects should be reduced to minimize the drop in gas selectivity, as shown in PVA membranes incorporated with zeolite. 6. Other co-polymers such as PEBAX was added into PVA membranes, but they showed low permeability and unsatisfactory gas selectivity. Table 7 further summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of different additives for comparison [76]. The selection should consider the economic and scalability of an additive besides its functionality to improve gas permeation, selectivity or mechanical properties of PVA membranes. PVA membranes were significantly affected by humidity in the separation of CO2 gas. The gas permeability and selectivity were improved by increasing the RH as the high-water content enhanced the reaction rate between amine carriers and CO2. However, the 100% RH reduced CO2 permeability due to the formation of a water layer on the membrane, causing a rise in mass transfer resistance but a drop in water condensation."
9,Future perspectives,"For future works, incorporating both fixed and mobile amine carriers into PVA membranes is important to ensure carbon capture can be accomplished with the full techno-economic potential. Carbonaceous materials such as carbon nanofibers and aerogel should be considered as they have been extensively studied as CO2 adsorbent. More importantly, inorganic nanoparticles or microporous particles should be explored since they exhibited promising separation results in CO2 adsorption. Metal organic frameworks such as ZIF-8 are the potential candidates as the microporous structure can promote gas diffusion. The inorganic nanoparticles and microporous particles should be also functionalized with amine groups to increase the CO2 carrier amount in PVA membranes. More importantly, the durability of PVA membranes in carbon capture should be further investigated. The effects of temperature, pressure, gas composition, plasticizers are essential parameters in the durability study. More coating strategies should be introduced so that the low cost hollow fiber membranes in the market can be converted into durable and effective CO2 selective membranes. This review confirms that PVA membranes are highly potent to be applied in CCUS as they surpassed the upper bound of the Robeson plot in the separation of CO2/N2. However, the application of PVA membranes is limited by several constraints in the current membrane production and separation systems. Incorporating different additives into PVA membranes introduces additional material and processing costs due to changes in viscosity, homogeneity, thermal and other physical properties. In addition, PVA membranes are significantly affected by the moisture content in gas mixtures. The moisture in the gas mixture containing CO2 is commonly removed before membrane gas separation to minimize membrane plasticization and piping corrosion (C.A.Scholes, S.E.Kentish and G.W.Stevens)[77]. Precise control of humidity is required to apply PVA membranes so that their performance can be improved by increasing the humidity without causing severe corrosion to the pipelines (M.C.Ferrari, A.Amelio, G.M.Nardelli and R.Costi) [78]. The overall carbon capture cost should be controlled below $58.30 per metric ton of CO2 (Laboratory) [79]."
