0,Introduction,"Excessive alcohol consumption is linked to various diseases, causing approximately 5% of the global disease burden [1]. Chronic alcohol abuse causes DNA damage, inflammation and oxidative stress, leading to the development of alcoholic liver disease, diabetes, atherosclerosis, pancreatitis and several types of cancer [2–4]. When macrophages are exposed to alcohol or its metabolites, such as acetaldehyde, they produce inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [3,4], which are primary contributors to the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced diseases. Astaxanthin (ASTX), a xanthophyll carotenoid abundant in marine animals, is a potent antioxidant [5,6]. Also, ASTX inhibits inflammation and oxidative stress by regulating the nuclear factor κB (NFκB) and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages [7]. Due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, ASTX is known to protect against diabetes, liver diseases, cancers, cardiovascular diseases and pancreatitis [8–14]. We previously showed that ASTX enhanced hepatic antioxidant capacity in apolipoprotein E-knockout mice [15]. ASTX also prevented the accumulation of ROS in hepatic stellate cells [16,17]. However, whether ASTX can counteract inflammation and oxidative stress triggered by alcohol is not well understood. In the present study, we determined the role of ASTX in the regulation of alcohol-induced inflammation and oxidative stress using two in vitro macrophage models, i.e., RAW 264.7 macrophages and mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM), and elucidated the underlying mechanisms of action. In particular, as sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a class III protein deacetylase, is known to regulate inflammation in alcohol-stimulated macrophage [18,19], we investigated a potential role of SIRT1 in the regulation of alcohol-induced inflammation by ASTX. We found that ASTX repressed ethanol-induced expression of proinflammatory genes and ROS accumulation, primarily by abrogating ethanol-induced decreases in SIRT1 expression and activity and cellular NAD+ levels."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Cell culture and treatment,"2.1 Cell culture and treatment Murine RAW 264.7 macrophages (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 media as we previously described [20]. BMDM were prepared from tibia and femur of C57BL/6J mice and cultured as previously described [20]. All cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37°C. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Connecticut. ASTX was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and prepared as we previously described [16]. Sirtinol and resveratrol, a SIRT1 inhibitor and an activator, respectively, were from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Cells were treated with 80 mM ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for the indicated time in the absence or presence of 25 μM of ASTX with a daily media change. Sirtinol and resveratrol stock solution (10 mM) was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at −80°C until use. Cells were treated with 15 μM of sirtinol or 10 μM of resveratrol in the absence or presence of ethanol and ASTX for 72 h."
3,Total RNA isolation and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR),"2.2 Total RNA isolation and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription for cDNA synthesis and qRT-PCR analysis were performed as previously described [21,22] using Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Primers were designed according to GenBank database using the Beacon Designer 7 software (PREMIER Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA, USA), and primer sequences are available upon request."
4,Western blot analysis,"2.3 Western blot analysis Preparation of total cell lysates and Western blot analysis were conducted as described [21,22]. Cytosolic and nuclear proteins of cells were isolated using a Nuclear Extraction Kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) according to the company's instruction. Antibodies for p65, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and TATA binding protein (TBP) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Antibody against SIRT1 was from Cell Signaling Technologies (Danvers, MA, USA). GAPDH, TBP and REVERT Total Protein Stain (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA) were used as a loading control for data normalization in cytosolic, nuclear and total protein, respectively. The blots were imaged and quantified using a Chemidoc XRS+ system (Bio-Rad) using Image Lab software (Bio-Rad) or a LI-COR Odyssey CLx (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA) with LI-COR Image Studio software."
5,Cellular ROS measurements,"2.4 Cellular ROS measurements Cellular ROS levels were quantified using 2′,7′-dicholorofluorescin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as we previously described [16]."
6,Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for TNFα,"2.5 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for TNFα After RAW 264.7 macrophages were treated with 80 mM ethanol in the absence or presence of 25 μM of ASTX for 72 h, conditioned medium was collected to measure TNFα using a TNF alpha mouse uncoated ELISA kit (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol."
7,Determination of SIRT1 activity,"2.6 Determination of SIRT1 activity Non-cell-based SIRT1 activity was determined using a SIRT1 Direct Fluorescent Screening Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical) following the manufacturer's protocol. Sirtinol (200 μM) was used as a negative control, and 100 μM or 200 μM of resveratrol was used as a positive control. For the measurement of cell-based SIRT1 activity, RAW 264.7 macrophages were treated with 80 mM ethanol in the absence or presence of 25 μM of ASTX for 72 h with daily media change, and then nuclear protein was extracted for SIRT1 deacetylase activity using a fluorometric activity assay kit (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). Fluorescence signal was measured at 340-nm excitation and 460-nm emission using a BioTek Synergy Mx (BioTek, Winoosky, VT, USA) microplate reader."
8,Measurement of cellular NAD+ levels,"2.7 Measurement of cellular NAD+ levels Cellular NAD+ levels were measured using the Li and Sauve's method [23] with slight modifications. Briefly, NAD+ was extracted from cells into ice-cold 7% perchloric acid. Supernatant from the acid-treated sample was then neutralized with 2 M NaOH and 500 mM K2HPO4 to pH 7. NAD+ standards (MilliporeSigma) and neutralized samples were mixed with cycling assay buffer to a final concentration of 25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 54 μM resazurin, 0.4 U/ml lactate dehydrogenase and 2.25 mM L-lactate. Reactions were then initiated by the addition of diaphorase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) to a final concentration of 0.7 U/well. Fluorescence signals were measured every 27 s for 15 min at 530-nm excitation and 580-nm emission using a BioTek Synergy Mx (BioTek, Winoosky, VT, USA) microplate reader. NAD+ levels were determined by comparing sample slopes with those of the standards. Results were normalized to cell numbers."
9,Statistical analyses,"2.8 Statistical analyses One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Newman–Keuls post hoc test or unpaired t test were used to detect significant differences between groups using GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Data were considered statistically significant at P<.05. Values are expressed as mean±S.E.M."
10,Results,
11,ASTX repressed ethanol-induced expression of proinflammatory genes in RAW 264.7 macrophages and BMDM by inhibiting the NFκB pathway,"3.1 ASTX repressed ethanol-induced expression of proinflammatory genes in RAW 264.7 macrophages and BMDM by inhibiting the NFκB pathway In RAW 264.7 macrophages, the expression of Il-1b was increased with increasing exposure time to ethanol (Fig. 1A). The level of Tnf mRNA was decreased within 24 h, but it was increased to reach the highest at 48 h of ethanol stimulation. Based on this observation, we chose 72 h of ethanol exposure for the following experiments. The ethanol exposure for 72 h significantly increased mRNA levels of Il-1b, Il-6 and Tnf, which were significantly decreased by ASTX in RAW 264.7 macrophages (Fig. 1B). Consistently, ASTX also significantly decreased TNFα secretion from ethanol-treated macrophages (Fig. 1C). The similar inhibitory effects of ASTX on inflammatory gene expression were observed in BMDM (Fig. 1D). Cytosolic and nuclear NFκB p65 levels were markedly increased by ethanol; however, ASTX prevented the increase in RAW 264.7 macrophages (Fig. 1E)."
12,ASTX repressed ethanol-induced ROS accumulation and induced antioxidant responses in RAW 264.7 macrophages,"3.2 ASTX repressed ethanol-induced ROS accumulation and induced antioxidant responses in RAW 264.7 macrophages Alcohol increases cellular ROS accumulation, leading to oxidative stress [2–4]. We previously reported that ASTX inhibited cellular ROS levels in LX-2 cells stimulated by transforming growth factor β1, a fibrogenic cytokine [16], and in RAW 264.7 macrophages activated by LPS [7]. Ethanol and acetylaldehyde, to a lesser extent, significantly increased cellular ROS levels, but ASTX completely abolished the increase (Fig. 2A). While the expression of cytochrome b-245, beta polypeptide (Cybb) (also known as NADPH oxidase 2), a ROS-producing enzyme, was not altered by ethanol, ASTX drastically decreased the gene expression (Fig. 2B). We found that mRNA levels of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nfe2l2) and other antioxidant genes, including catalase (Cat), superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1), Sod2 and glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1), were significantly increased by ethanol; however, ASTX significantly decreased mRNA expression of Nfe2l2 and Cat. Interestingly, ASTX markedly increased Sod2, Gpx1 and Gpx4 mRNA levels in RAW 264.7 macrophages stimulated with ethanol (Fig. 2C)."
13,ASTX repressed ethanol-induced ROS accumulation while inducing antioxidant responses in BMDM,"3.3 ASTX repressed ethanol-induced ROS accumulation while inducing antioxidant responses in BMDM The inhibitory effects of ASTX on cellular ROS accumulation were also observed in BMDM. ASTX abolished an increase in ROS levels stimulated by ethanol or acetaldehyde to the basal levels (Fig. 3A), with concomitant repression of alcohol-induced Cybb expression in BMDM (Fig. 3B). However, the expression of Nfe2l2, Cat and Sod1 was significantly decreased in response to ethanol, while all antioxidant genes measured were significantly increased by ASTX in BMDM (Fig. 3C)."
14,ASTX abrogated an ethanol-induced decrease in Sirt1 expression in both RAW 264.7 macrophages and BMDM,"3.4 ASTX abrogated an ethanol-induced decrease in Sirt1 expression in both RAW 264.7 macrophages and BMDM SIRT1 is known to inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines and ROS accumulation in macrophages [24,25]. Ethanol metabolites, such as acetaldehyde and acetate, are shown to decrease SIRT1 expression [18,19]. Therefore, we next determined whether ASTX can abrogate the repressive effect of ethanol on Sirt1 expression in macrophages. In RAW 264.7 macrophages, ethanol significantly reduced Sirt1 mRNA abundance, which was significantly attenuated by ASTX (Fig. 4A). Consistently, ethanol decreased SIRT1 protein by more than 40%, but ASTX markedly increased the protein in RAW 264.7 macrophages (Fig. 4B). In BMDM, Sirt1 mRNA was drastically decreased by ethanol, but ASTX abolished the change similarly as shown in RAW 264.7 macrophages (Fig. 4C)."
15,ASTX increased SIRT1 activity and cellular NAD+ level in RAW 264.7 macrophages,"3.5 ASTX increased SIRT1 activity and cellular NAD+ level in RAW 264.7 macrophages Ethanol decreased mRNA and protein levels of SIRT1, and ASTX attenuated the decrease in both RAW 264.7 macrophages and BMDM. Therefore, we further investigated a potential role of SIRT1 in the inhibitory effect of ASTX on the ethanol-induced changes in inflammatory and antioxidant gene expression as well as ROS accumulation. SIRT1 activity was measured by non-cell-based and cell-based assays. Sirtinol, a SIRT1 inhibitor [26,27], and resveratrol, a natural SIRT activator [27,28], were used as a negative and positive control in the assays, respectively. In a non-cell-based assay, sirtinol markedly decreased SIRT1 activity, while resveratrol significantly increased the activity as expected ( Fig. 5A ). ASTX significantly, but modestly, increased SIRT1 activity. In a cell-based SIRT1 activity assay, ethanol significantly decreased SIRT1 activity by more than 60%, which was almost completely abolished by ASTX in RAW 264.7 macrophages ( Fig. 5B). As SIRT1 is a member of the SIRT, class III histone deacetylase family that requires NAD+ for their activation [23–25,29], we measured cellular NAD + levels in macrophages. Ethanol significantly reduced cellular NAD+ levels, which were abolished by ASTX ( Fig. 5C)."
16,SIRT1 inhibition augmented the proinflammatory effects of ethanol in RAW 264.7 macrophages,"3.6 SIRT1 inhibition augmented the proinflammatory effects of ethanol in RAW 264.7 macrophages We next determined the contribution of SIRT1 to the anti-inflammatory effect of ASTX in macrophages exposed to ethanol. In unstimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages, sirtinol significantly increased proinflammatory gene expression, including Il1b, Tnf and Ccl2, which was attenuated by ASTX to the basal level, while Sirt1 mRNA was not altered by the inhibitor (Fig. 6 ). Ethanol significantly increased the expression of the proinflammatory genes, e.g., Il1b, Tnf and Ccl2, while decreasing Sirt1 mRNA levels. All of the changes were more drastic in the presence of sirtinol. However, ASTX significantly attenuated the effect of ethanol and sirtinol. Resveratrol and ASTX did not affect the expression of proinflammatory genes and Sirt1 in unstimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages (Fig. 7 ). However, an increase in Il1b, Tnf and Ccl2 and a decrease in Sirt1 mRNA by ethanol were significantly abrogated by ASTX or resveratrol alone and by ASTX and resveratrol in combination to a greater extent."
17,Discussion,"Ethanol can disrupt the innate immune system and metabolic homeostasis, leading to the development of cancer, alcoholic liver disease, diabetes and respiratory distress syndrome [2–4]. In particular, excessive alcohol consumption leads to liver diseases in over 10 million people in the United States [1,30]. Studies have shown anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of ASTX in macrophages stimulated with LPS or hydrogen peroxide [5–7,17]. Whether ASTX can exert similar effects in macrophages exposed to ethanol has not been fully understood. To explore the preventive/therapeutic potential of ASTX in alcohol-associated diseases, we evaluated the effect of ASTX on ethanol-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in macrophages. In the present study, we found that ASTX abolished the ethanol-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in macrophages, at least in part, via the activation of SIRT1. ASTX increased SIRT1 activity by inducing its expression and also increasing cellular levels of NAD+, which is critical for SIRT1 activation. Upon exposure to ethanol, macrophages produce ROS [2–4,18]. Consistently, we observed that ethanol markedly increased cellular ROS levels in both RAW 264.7 macrophages and BMDM. Ethanol increased the expression of Cybb in RAW 264.7 macrophages, the gene encoding NADPH oxidase-2 (NOX-2), which is one of the primary enzymes that produce ROS in macrophages [31,32]. Interestingly, in BMDM, despite a similar trend of ROS accumulation, antioxidant gene expression including Nfe2l2 showed a different pattern from that of RAW 264.7 macrophages. The difference in antioxidant response to ethanol between the two macrophage cell types may be related to their differentiation states. For instance, a differentiation state of macrophage may affect the extent of ROS accumulation because ROS production is critical for the determination of macrophage phenotypes [33–35]. We used both macrophage models, i.e., RAW 264.7 macrophages and BMDM, because the former is a widely used macrophage cell line while the latter is an in vitro model close to physiology than cell lines. Although we observed some differences in antioxidant gene expression between the two cell types, their response to ethanol and ASTX as to cellular ROS accumulation was similar. Excessive ROS generation and accumulation induce oxidative stress in cells [2–4]. ASTX is known to effectively scavenge ROS due to the chemical structure of conjugated double bonds [6,36,37]. Consistently, we found that ASTX markedly abolished an ethanol-induced increase in ROS accumulation in macrophages. Our results also indicate that SIRT1 may play a crucial role in the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect of ASTX in macrophages exposed to ethanol. Consistent with other studies [18,19], we found that ethanol significantly decreased the expression of Sirt1, which was attenuated by ASTX. Furthermore, the inhibition of SIRT1 activity by sirtinol, a SIRT1 inhibitor, resulted in a significant increase in ethanol-induced expression of proinflammatory genes, while resveratrol, an activator of SIRT1, decreased it significantly in macrophages. It is known that SIRT1 suppresses the activity of activator protein-1 (AP-1) by deacetylating AP-1, consequently down-regulating the expression of ROS-generating enzymes, such as NOX-2 and cyclooxygenase-2 [19,38–40]. Consistently, we found that Cybb expression and ROS accumulation were increased in response to ethanol stimulation in macrophages, which were decreased to the basal level by ASTX due to increased SIRT1 activity. The activation of SIRT1 may be related to forkhead box O3 (FOXO3), which can bind to p53, a repressive regulator of SIRT1, consequently inducing Sirt1 expression [41–43]. Importantly, studies have shown that exposure of macrophages to ethanol can phosphorylate FOXO3 to inhibit its activity, leading to decreased expression of Sirt1 [41,44]. Therefore, it can be presumed that FOXO3 may play a role in the inhibitory effect of ASTX on the repression of Sirt1 by ethanol in macrophages. Future study needs to be warranted to determine how ASTX modulates FOXO3 to alter the expression of Sirt1 in macrophages. The present study shows that nuclear translocation of p65 NFκB was increased by ethanol, which was abolished by ASTX. It has been shown that ethanol facilitates the release of NFκB from inhibitor of κB, leading to the nuclear translocation of NFκB [6–8,41,45]. When lysine residues in NFκB are acetylated, its nuclear translocation and DNA binding are enhanced, increasing the transcription of its target inflammatory genes [4–8]. Interestingly, studies have shown that SIRT1 decreases the nuclear translocation of NFκB by decreasing its acetylation state [46,47]. In addition, SIRT1 may counteract NFκB by altering coactivators or corepressors that work with NFκB. SIRT1 interacts with transducin-like enhancer of split 1, a corepressor of NFκB, to enhance its inhibitory effect [48,49]. SIRT1 can also inactivate p300/CREB binding protein (p300/CBP), coactivators of NFκB, to repress the acetylation of p65 at the NFκB amino acid sequence in the nucleus [50]. In response to inflammatory stimuli, p300/CBP acetylates poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) at specific lysine residues, which is essential for activation of NFκB [51,52]. In addition, PARP-1 can directly interact with p300 and NFκB subunits to form a stable nuclear complex to activate NFκB [51,52]. However, it is also noteworthy that SIRT1 inhibits PARP-1 activity by deacetylating this enzyme [48,51,52]. During the formation of (ADP-ribose) polymers on target proteins, PARP-1 consumes NAD+, resulting in SIRT1 inhibition and NFκB activation [51,52]. Collectively, SIRT1 may inhibit NFκB activity by inhibiting its nuclear translocation and its acetylation in the nucleus and by controlling its interaction with transcriptional repressors or coactivators. Ethanol is oxidized to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenases with the consumption of NAD+, producing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydride (NADH). Conversion of acetaldehyde to acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenases also consumes NAD+ [19,23,53]. Therefore, oxidation of ethanol reduces cellular NAD+ levels, leading to a reduction in SIRT1 activity, as NAD+ is a cofactor of SIRT1 [19,47,53–55]. In the present study, we found that the reduction of cellular NAD+ by ethanol was abrogated by ASTX. To compensate NAD+ consumed to metabolize ethanol, a resultant oxidative state needs to be converted into a reductive condition to reverse NADH into NAD+ [23,53,55]. ASTX may prevent oxidative environment by quenching and scavenging oxidative components, such as oxygen and its radicals, which are generated from ethanol metabolism. This could regenerate NAD+ from NADH, resulting in an increase of NAD+ level in macrophages. Therefore, the potential regeneration of NAD+ by ASTX may contribute to SIRT1 activation in ethanol-stimulated macrophages. In summary, we showed in the present study that ASTX exerts anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in ethanol-stimulated macrophages not only by inhibiting nuclear translocation of NFκB but also by reducing cellular ROS accumulation. Our results suggest that ASTX counteracted the repressive effect of ethanol on SIRT1 expression. Furthermore, by preventing a decrease in cellular NAD+ levels by ethanol, ASTX is likely to increase SIRT1 activity as well. Therefore, ASTX may be consumed to prevent alcohol-induced diseases with inflammation and oxidative stress."
