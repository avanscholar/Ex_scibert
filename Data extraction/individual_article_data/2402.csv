0,Introduction,"The high global demand for energy, uncertainty of petroleum resources and concerns about climatic changes has led the resurgence in the development of alternative fuels. In the last years, there has been growing discontent regarding the ecological impact of anthropogenic actions related to the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and its accumulation in the atmosphere (Chong and O’Shea, 2012). In order to reduce the dependence for oil and mitigate its environmental impacts, renewable fuels such as biogas (CH4 and H2) and ethanol obtained from different feedstocks have received special attention, being introduced in the energy matrix of different countries. Brazil is considered one of the pioneers in alternative fuel technologies and sustainable energy policies using mainly sugarcane as a raw material (Gurgel et al., 2012). However, during processing of sugarcane to obtain ethanol and sugar, large amounts of sugarcane bagasse (SB) are produced and, after burning to supply the energy expenditure for the production of first generation (1G) ethanol, it is stored in uncovered stockpiles. Because of that, the excess of SB rapidly becomes an environmental and industrial risk problem due to its possible spontaneous combustion, and for these reasons it is important to develop conversion technologies for the production of biofuels, bioenergy and bioelectricity using this lignocellulosic waste. Lignocellulosic biomass, such as SB, has a cell wall composed of three main structural materials: cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin (Carvalho et al., 2015). The production of biofuels such as second generation ethanol (2G) using SB is possible if the sugar-rich fractions are separated from the complex structure of the cell wall and, for this, different pretreatment techniques have been developed to reduce the recalcitrance of lignocellulose biomass (Zheng et al., 2014) and enhance its biodigestibility. In general, the pretreatment methods can be divided into physical (e.g. comminution and irradiation), chemical (e.g. alkaline, acidic and ozonation), physical-chemical (e.g. steam explosion, liquid hot water process and AFEX), biological (e.g. fungal, bacterial and enzymatic pretreatment) and sometimes their combination (Mussatto, 2016). Ozonation is one of the most promising lignocellulose biomass oxidative pretreatments since ozone can attack the lignin and hemicelluloses, exhibiting little preference for the cellulose fraction. In addition, it is able to break the association between these components to produce a solid fraction with a better reactivity for subsequent processes such as enzymatic hydrolysis (Travaini et al., 2016b). Ozone can react directly or via the production of hydroxyl radicals (OH) with different classes of organic compounds (Gottschalk et al., 2002). The ozone reactions can be controlled by different types of kinetics as well as different process conditions such as pH, UV light, catalyst presence, among others (Glaze et al., 1987). Biomass ozonation has focused on enhancing its nutritive value and for improving the enzymatic susceptibility to produce biofuels. This pretreatment can be performed in fixed bed columns or completely stirred reactors, and most data in the literature have shown that ozonation can effectively degrade lignin and slightly affect hemicelluloses, even though their degradation mainly depends on biomass water content (Arenas-Cárdenas et al., 2016). The simplest configuration is a fixed bed column, however channeling and uneven ozone exposure are the main drawbacks of this configuration. (Mussatto, 2016). When mixed reactors are used, a constant flow and concentration of ozone comes into the reactor, but in this case the ozone escapes quickly. In this case, the mass transfer between gas, liquid and biomass plays an important role in reactor performance (Travaini et al., 2015). Therefore, it is possible that by optimizing the amount of water and maintaining a mixed reactor configuration during biomass pretreatment, it could improve hemicelluloses degradation which would then be used for biogas production. The optimization of these conditions for SB pretreatment can ensure a better utilization of the solid and the liquid fraction. During SB ozonation a liquid fraction with a high chemical oxygen demand is generated and little is known about the use of this fraction as a substrate for the production of biogas by anaerobic digestion (AD). Most of the studies available in the literature consider the complete use of pretreated biomass, i.e. solid and liquid fractions, to produce biogas (CH4 or H2) and estimate the effects of pretreatment in the digestibility of SB but not the separated use of these fractions. Biogas production from anaerobic digestion of different types of substrates is an old and established method with significant advantages such as low sludge production, low cost and low energy consumption (Lettinga and van Haandel, 1993). Some authors like Baêta et al. (2016a), Rabelo et al. (2011) and Sawatdeenarunat et al. (2015) have reported the biogas production using different fractions of pretreated lignocellulose biomass, showing that the AD can help to integrate the production of first (1G) and second (2G) generation biofuels. In this study, the ozone pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse was optimized in a mechanical mixed reactor at different pH values with the aim of obtaining the best process conditions for the solubilization of both hemicelluloses and lignin from sugarcane bagasse, thereby leaving a solid phase prone to enzymatic hydrolysis and 2G ethanol production. In addition, the soluble liquid fractions resulting from this process were chemically characterized and submitted to anaerobic digestion aiming the production of biogas (CH4 and H2)."
1,Material and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Cyclohexane, ethanol (99.5%), hydrochloric acid (36–37%) and sodium hydroxide were purchased from Synth (Brazil). Sulfuric acid (95–98%) and (99.999%) were purchased from Synth and Sigma-Aldrich (Brazil), respectively. The chromatography grade standards cellobiose, D-glucose, D-xylose, L-arabinose, acetic acid, formic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, isovaleric acid, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfuraldehyde (HMF) and 2-furfuraldehyde (FF) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Brazil).

Oxygen (purity 99.99%) used during ozonolysis was purchased from White Martins/Praxair (Brazil)."
3,Sugarcane bagasse preparation,"2.2 Sugarcane bagasse preparation SB was provided by Jatiboca Sugar and Ethanol Plant (Ponte Nova, MG, Brazil), and it was collected in the harvest 2013/2014. SB was prepared according to the methodology described by Baêta et al. (2016b). SB was stored at temperatures below 0°C prior to be used in the ozone pretreatment."
4,Analytical methods for characterization of solid and liquid fractions,"2.3 Analytical methods for characterization of solid and liquid fractions Oven dried SB samples were milled in a Wiley mill (Marconi, model MA048) and the fractions retained on the 40-mesh screen were used in the compositional tests. The ash (inorganic) content was determined according to the standard method “Ash in wood, pulp, paper and paperboard”, TAPPI T211 om–02. The quantitative determination of extractives in raw SB was carried out according to TAPPI T204cm–07 with minor modification. The acid–insoluble lignin content in the solid fractions was determined in accordance with the standard method “Determination of acid-insoluble lignin in biomass”, NREL LAP-004. The concentration of sugars (cellobiose, glucose, xylose and arabinose), organic acids (acetic and formic acids) and sugar degradation products (FF and HMF) was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in a Shimadzu HPLC system equipped with an Aminex HPX 87H column (300×7.8mm Bio-Rad) kept at 55°C (Shimadzu, model CTO-30A) using a refractive index detector (Shimadzu, model RID-6A) for sugar and a UV–vis detector (Shimadzu SPD–10AV) set at the wavelengths of 210nm and 274nm for organic acids and sugar degradation products, respectively. Sulfuric acid (5mmolL−1) was used as an eluent at a flow rate of 0.6mLmin−1. The mass of sugars, organic acids and sugar degradation products was used to calculate the contents of cellulose and hemicelluloses in the solid fractions. The coefficients used to convert sugars, organic acids and sugar degradation products into cellulose and hemicelluloses were those described by (Gurgel et al., 2014). The xylooligomers (XOS) present in the SLF were determined as described by NREL LAP-015 by means of an acidic treatment of a SLF sample (SLF-to-water ratio of 1:10, 4wt.% H2SO4 at 121°C for 1h). The content of XOS was then estimated from the difference in the concentration of monomeric sugars and sugar degradation products found in the SLF before and after the hydrolysis (acidic treatment). The concentration of total organic carbon (TOC) in the SLF from the ozone pretreatment of SB was determined using a TOC–L CPH/CPN Shimadzu equipment. The biogas production was monitored until stabilization of the anaerobic batch reactors and the gas composition was measured by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC, model 2014/TCD) equipped with CP-Molsieve 5A and CP Pora BOND Q columns, using nitrogen as a carrier gas. All analyses were performed in triplicate. The identification of other compounds presents in the SLF generated during the ozone pretreatment of SB was performed in a Shimadzu gas chromatographic equipment coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS-QP2010 plus). Such system was equipped with the column ZB-5HT (30m×0.25mm×0.10μm) and the injector temperature and the GC/MS interface were maintained at 280°C. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.46mLmin−1 and the detector voltage was 0.98kV and the temperature of ionization font was set to 250°C. Initially, the samples were frozen and subsequently lyophilized for 24h using a temperature of −30°C and a vacuum of 6.66Pa (freeze-dryer Liotop, L101). The lyophilized samples were dissolved in pyridine, placed in an ultrasound bath for 60min and then 25μL of these samples were mixed with 75 μL of 1% (v v−1) BSTFA for sample derivatization. Finally, a derivative sample of 10 μL was injected in the GC/MS for analysis and a total run time of 60min was used. The compounds detected by GC/MS were identified through mass spectral library using NIST version 2.0d."
5,"Experimental design, statistical analysis and modeling the experimental data","2.4 Experimental design, statistical analysis and modeling the experimental data Ozone pretreatment of SB was carried out by a factorial design. The pretreatment parameters (independent variables) selected for this study were ozone load (mg O3 min−1), liquid-to-solid ratio (LSR, mL g−1), time (t, min) and pH. The planning matrix for the fractional factorial design is shown in Table 1 . The dependent variables evaluated in the SLF were content of C5-C6 sugars (xylose and arabinose plus glucose), soluble lignin (SL,) and total organic carbon concentration (TOC). For the solid pretreated fraction, the lignin content and hemicelluloses removal was also estimated. For anaerobic digestion experiments using the SLF as substrate, the biochemical hydrogen potential (BHP, Nm3 H2 kg TOC−1) and biochemical methane potential (BMP, Nm3 CH4 kg TOC−1) were evaluated. The results were analyzed with STATISTICA ® software (version 10) with a 95% significance level. Response surfaces were built for all the dependent variables. The modified Gompertz model was used to model the experimental data acquired from the BMP and BHP tests. The maximum hydrogen and methane production (P) was calculated by a nonlinear sigmoidal regression analysis of the experimental data according to Eq. (1) (Baêta et al., 2016b; Zwietering et al., 1990). (1) P / m m o l = P 0 exp { − exp [ R m e P 0 ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where P 0 is the hydrogen or methane production potential (mmol H2 or CH4), R m is the maximum hydrogen or methane production rate (mmol H2 or CH4 d−1), λ is the lag phase time (days) and e is exp(1). The validity of the model was checked by the determination coefficient (R 2) as well as by assessing their errors by the root-mean-square error (RMSE). BHP and BMP results were standardized by converting mmol to Nm3, considering STP conditions (273.15 K and 101315 Pa), and by dividing the obtained value by the TOC fed into the digestion bottles."
6,Ozone pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse,"2.5 Ozone pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse SB was subjected to ozone pretreatment using mechanical mixed reactor made of glass (100mm of height, 79.8mm internal diameter and 81.8mm external diameter) with a capacity of 500 cm3 operated in a semi-continuous mode, i.e. with continuous feeding of ozone gas and one batch feed of SB per run. Ozone gas was generated from oxygen by electrical discharge (Ozone Generator, model O&L3.0RM, Ozone & Life Indústria, São José dos Campos, SP, Brazil) with a production capacity of 3g O3 h−1. The reactor was loaded with 20.0g of SB on a dry-weight basis, and distilled water with different pH values (3, 7 and 11) to give different liquid-to-solid ratios as described in Table 1. The excess of ozone (residual or off-gas) was bubbled into a KI solution (2gL−1) in order to convert it into O2 before its discharge in the environment. The pretreated SB was dewatered in a hydraulic press (SOLAB®, model SL-10) by applying 9 tons of pressure. The SLF recovered after pressing the pretreated SB was collected, stored in a freezer (−20°C) and characterized for its composition in terms of monosaccharides (glucose, xylose and arabinose), sugar degradation products (FF and HMF), organic acids (acetic and formic acids), soluble lignin (SL), total organic carbon (TOC), as well as GC/MS as previously described in Section 2.3. After the compositional characterization, a part of the SLF was submitted to anaerobic biodegradability tests to evaluate their BHP and BMP. The pretreated SB (solid fraction) was characterized in terms of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin for calculating the removal efficiency removal of these components during pretreatment."
7,Anaerobic digestion of soluble liquid fraction for biogas production,"2.6 Anaerobic digestion of soluble liquid fraction for biogas production Batch anaerobic digestion tests were carried out in triplicate to assess the BMP and BHP of SLF obtained from the ozone pretreatment of SB. A control test, without addition of substrate was also included in the tests to check the methanogenic activity as well as the hydrogen activity of the inoculums. All experiments were carried out at mesophilic conditions in glass bottles of 15mL. The glass bottles were placed in a thermostatic orbital shaker at 35.1±0.3°C and 170rpm. The liquid volume of each glass bottle was 10mL, leaving a headspace volume of 5mL. The anaerobic inoculum used for the BMP tests was taken from a pilot-scale mesophilic UASB reactor fed with sewage at the Centre for Research and Training on Sanitation (CePTS), UFMG/Copasa (Arrudas Wastewater Treatment Plant, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil). The inoculum was pre-incubated for four days (35°C) to offset the methane production from the biodegradation of any residual organic matter (Baêta et al., 2016a). The anaerobic inoculum used for the hydrogen production was also taken from CePTS, UFMG/Copasa and mixed with cow manure in a ratio of 1:1 (w w−1), on dry-weight basis. A heat treatment (90°C for 10min) was used to eliminate the hydrogen consuming methanogens and to enrich the inoculum with hydrogen producing microorganisms such as Clostridium sp. After thermal treatment, the inoculum was maintained at pH∼5.5 and fed weekly with an aqueous xylose solution (1.0gL−1) (Baêta et al., 2016b). A sample of SLF (8.0mL) was added to the glass bottles containing varied volumes of inoculum − depending on the TOC concentration in each SLF sample − to keep a food-to-microorganism ratio of 0.4 and 1.825g TOC g VSS−1 for BMP and BHP tests, respectively (Baêta et al., 2016a; Lazaro et al., 2014). In each experiment, a buffer solution containing sodium bicarbonate and micro- and macronutrients was added. The concentration of micro- and macronutrients varied in each experiment in order to maintain a minimum COD:N:P ratio of 350:5:1, as reported by Baêta et al. (2013). At the end of the BMP and BHP tests, samples were collected to measure TOC and volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentration. The BHP and BMP tests were finished when the daily hydrogen and methane production was smaller than 1% of their total accumulation (Baêta et al., 2016b)."
8,Enzymatic hydrolysis of solid fraction,"2.7 Enzymatic hydrolysis of solid fraction For the enzymatic hydrolysis experiments, 1.000g of the solid fractions (on dry-weight basis) obtained from ozonation of SB were hydrolyzed with 10.0mL of an aqueous 0.05molL−1 citric acid-sodium citrate buffer solution (pH 5.0), 10 FPU of cellulase (Celuclast 1.5L) and 52.2IU of β-glucosidase (Novozym 188). Enzymatic hydrolysis experiments were performed in 25mL Erlenmeyer flasks in an orbital shaker incubator (New Brunswick 24 incubator series) at 50°C and 150rpm for 72h. After this time, aliquots were taken and the hydrolysates were placed in an ice bath to stop the enzymatic hydrolysis. The liquid and solid fractions were separated by centrifugation at 400rpm for 15min and the sugars present in the liquid fraction were separated and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described in Section 2.3. The enzymatic conversion was then calculated in accordance with Meighan et al. (2017)."
9,Energy balance,"2.8 Energy balance Energy balance for best condition was estimated considering the amount of energy generated (E H2(+), E CH4(+)) from the combustion (90% efficiency) of hydrogen (ΔH combustion =10.8 MJ Nm−3 H2) and methane (ΔH combustion =34.5 MJ Nm−3 CH4) produced during the BMP and BHP tests. The energy produced by combustion of the solid fraction after enzymatic hydrolysis (E CSR (+)) for the best ozonation condition was also considered to estimate energy profitability of the process. The energy spent during the ozonolysis pretreatment E(−) was estimated to calculate the net energy gain (ΔE CH4 and ΔE H2) of each process using Eqs. (2)-(7), as follows. (2) E ( − ) = O 3 l o a d × reaction time × 1 kg S B f e d × E f O 3 (3) E CSR ( + ) = w cellu,SR × Δ H comb,cellu ∘ + w hemi,SR × Δ H comb,hemi ∘ + w lig,SR × Δ H comb,lig ∘ (4) E CH 4 ( + ) = B M P × 0.9 × T O C soluble k g S B × Δ H ∘ comb,CH 4 (5) E H 2 ( + ) = B H P × 0.9 × T O C soluble k g S B × Δ H ∘ comb,H 2 (6) Δ E CH 4 = E CH 4 ( + ) + E CSR ( + ) − E ( − ) (7) Δ E H 2 = E H 2 ( + ) + E CSR ( + ) − E ( − ) where O3 load is the quantity of ozone used during each experiment; reaction time is the time spent for pretreatment; EfO3 is the energy needed to produce 100g of ozone (1.65 MJ (Travaini et al., 2016a)); BHP is the biochemical hydrogen potential; BMP is the biochemical methane potential; TOC soluble/SB dry weight is the amount of soluble total organic carbon present in the SLF after ozonolysis pretreatment per kg of SB on dry-weight basis; w cellu,SR is the cellulose weight in the solid fraction after enzymatic hydrolysis, w hemi,SR is the hemicelluloses weight in the solid fraction after enzymatic hydrolysis, w lig,SR is the lignin weight in the solid fraction after enzymatic hydrolysis, finally, ΔH°comb,cellu =17 MJ kg−1, ΔH°comb,hemi =16.63 MJ kg−1 and ΔH°comb,lig =26.7 MJ kg−1 are the heat of combustion of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin, respectively."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Sugarcane bagasse characterization,"3.1 Sugarcane bagasse characterization The chemical composition of SB used as a raw material in this study was 42.20% cellulose, 25.80% hemicelluloses, 25.50% lignin, 2.22% extractives and 1.50% ash (inorganics). This composition is in accordance with that reported by Canilha et al. (2012) and Oliveira et al. (2014)."
12,Degradation of lignin in sugarcane bagasse,"3.2 Degradation of lignin in sugarcane bagasse The results for lignin solubilization obtained from the ozone pretreatment of SB are presented in Table 1. The greatest lignin removal (45.2%) was obtained for the experiment 1, which used as process conditions an ozone load of 8mgO3 min−1, a LSR of 13.3mLg−1, a reaction time of 15min and a pH of 11. These conditions favored the generation of hydroxyl radicals (OH), a typical feature of an advanced oxidation process (AOP) using ozone in an alkaline pH as reported by Glaze et al. (1987). It is important to emphasize that for a reaction time of 15min the delignification extent (45.19%) was similar when compared to the results reported by Souza-Corrêa et al. (2013) and Travaini et al. (2015, 2013), who used higher contact times (from 45 to 360 min) and fixed bed reactors to obtain SB delignifications from 50% to 67%. In this sense, the process efficiency is related to the reaction kinetics, which is favored by the higher mass transfer characteristic of the reactor used here. Besides, the results obtained in the present study show that the AOP required lower contact times to attain a greater delignification extent when compared to the molecular oxidation processes, which uses gaseous ozone in neutral or acidic pH (Covinich et al., 2014). Different studies have demonstrated the capacity of ozone to remove lignin from lignocellulose biomass, where it can undergo a direct or indirect reaction. These two reaction pathways lead to different oxidation products and are controlled by different types of kinetics (Travaini et al., 2016b). The extent of lignin solubilization (Table 1) did not exhibit a specific behavior due to the variety of process conditions used in the present study. For example, when longer reaction times (120min) were used, there was no increase in the lignin removal, thereby suggesting that ozone pretreatment might have led to lignin modification by adding new reactive functional groups to it, which is likely to enhance lignin condensation reactions (Kobayashi et al., 2005; Ragnar et al., 1999b). The Pareto’s chart of the standardized effects presented in Fig. 1 a shows that there are significant negative effects of the independent variables ozone load, LSR and their interaction on lignin removal. The major significant negative effect is related to the LSR variable (−6.46), which has been confirmed by different studies reported in the literature, since water greatly influences mass transport between gas, liquid and solid phases. Furthermore, this influence is also directly related to the reactor type, because the reactor configuration controls the presence of liquid phase and flow pattern, thereby having an effect on the concentration of ozone and hydroxyl radicals generated by ozone decomposition (Li et al., 2015; Neely, 1984; Travaini et al., 2015). Consequently, in terms of industrial process it would be interesting the use of mechanical mixed reactor, which could increase processing rates and degree of mixture, thereby helping the process kinetics. A response surface for lignin solubilization was generated by multiple linear model (Supplementary Material) for the most significant independent variables, i.e. LSR and ozone load for ozone pretreatment of SB. The response surface shown in Fig. 1b was built fixing the pH at 11 and the reaction time in 15min. The adjusted model had a coefficient of determination (R 2) and RMSE of 0.89 and 3.8, respectively, meaning that the model could explain 89% of lignin removal variability with an error of 12.2%. Fig. 1b shows it is necessary to use a low LSR and pH of 11, maintaining low levels for the variable ozone load, to attain significant lignin removals. A hypothesis to explain this behavior is attributed to the oxidation process reaction scheme reported by Glaze et al. (1987), which shows that ozone can react directly with an organic substrate through a slow and selective reaction in acidic pH, and that a fast and non-selective reaction of hydroxyl radical (OH) with an organic substrate is favored by alkaline pH. Thus, the hydroxyl radicals formed in liquid phase − considered as powerful oxidizing agents − seemed to be decisive in the breakdown of compounds difficult to degrade such as lignin (Covinich et al., 2014)."
13,Degradation of hemiceluloses in sugarcane bagasse,"3.3 Degradation of hemiceluloses in sugarcane bagasse Hemicelluloses solubilization triggered by ozone pretreatment of SB at different process conditions are shown in Table 1. It is seen that the highest hemicelluloses removal was noticed for the experiment 1 (48.28%), which used an ozone load of 8mgO3 min−1, a LSR of 13 3mLg−1, a pH of 11 and a reaction time of 15min. At such scenario AOP is likely to prevail due to the favorable conditions for hydroxyl radicals formation. These results are very promising when compared to those reported by Souza-Corrêa et al. (2013) and García-Cubero et al. (2009), who used ozone treatment with higher contact times (from 150 to 360min) and obtained hemicelluloses solubilization between 35% and 50% for sugarcane bagasse and wheat straw, respectively. As seen in Table 1, it is important to notice that there is a relationship between lignin and hemiceluloses removal. When the lignin content in the solid phase decreased, the solubilization of hemicellulose increased since both compounds are closely related in the lignin-hemicellulose complex (Mussatto, 2016). This behavior has been demonstrated by García-Cubero et al. (2009) and Li et al. (2015) who investigated the efficiency of ozone on lignin and hemicelluloses removal from wheat and rice straw as well as maize stove. Although the results shown in Table 1 for experiments 5 and 11 showed significant levels of hemicelluloses removal (∼44%), these conditions employed greater ozone load and lower values of pH (<11). A comparison between the experiments 5 (pH=3) and 1 (pH=11) allows observing the effect of pH in the hemicelluloses removal during the process. At low pH values, it was necessary to apply a higher ozone load (experiment 5=17.5 mgO3 min−1and experiment 1=8.0 mgO3 min−1) to obtain the same hemicelluloses removal, and this is because the removal mechanism is pH dependent. When an acid condition is used there is a lower formation of hydroxyl radical (OH) and the reaction occurs primarily by direct attack of ozone, which requires a higher flow rate of O3 to ensure a medium with a higher amount of hydroxyl radicals. On the other hand, at basic conditions, the highly oxidative and non-specific hydroxyl radicals (OH) enhances the reaction kinetics, implying in good hemicelluloses removal even when low doses of ozone are applied (Ragnar et al., 1999a). A response surface graph (Fig. 1d) was generated by the multiple linear model shown in Supplementary Table 1 for the most significant independent variables, i.e. pH and ozone load. Fig. 1d was built fixing LSR in 13.3mLg−1 and reaction time in 15 min. The coefficient of determination (R 2) and RMSE for the adjusted model were 0.91 and 1.54, respectively. Fig. 1c confirms that there is a significant positive effect for the interaction between the variables pH and ozone load. Hemicelluloses removal results from random cleavage of glycosidic bonds during the reaction between hydroxyl radicals and SB carbohydrates. This cleavage begins with a hydrogen abstraction followed by an oxidation of the subsequent carbon-centered radical, allowing the introduction of carbonyl groups (Travaini et al., 2015) to form carbonyl and carboxyl groups as well as lactones and hydroperoxides (Ben’ko et al., 2013). As can be seen in Table 1, the conditions that generated a liquid fraction with higher content of C5-C6 sugars were the experiments 10 (∼5mg) and 2 (∼4mg), which were not the ones that solubilized higher levels of hemicelluloses. Sugar solubilization obtained in the present study was lower than that reported by Baêta et al. (2016a) (0.57g), who studied the hydrothermal pretreatment of SB, and similar to that (0.171g) obtained by Rabelo et al. (2011) during alkaline peroxide pretreatment of SB. The amount of sugar observed in the hydrolysates obtained in the present study and those reported in the literature indicates that processes involving oxidants such as peroxide and ozone are not favorable to release sugar in the monomeric form (glucose, xylose and arabinose) despite being able to solubilize hemicelluloses. A hypothesis that explains the low sugar content in hydrolysates of SB treatment with ozone relies on the formation of oligomers and sugar oxidation products, as reported by Holen et al. (1998) and Marcq et al. (2009) due to indirect and non-selective radical reactions that can generate intermediate compounds such as organic acids (Mussatto, 2016). In order to verify the presence of oligomers in the SLF, the content of XOS was measured for experiments 1 and 10 and found to be approximately 96.4% of all sugars detected in the liquid fraction. The production of soluble compounds, such as carboxylic acids, from ozone treatment of SB was reported by Travaini et al. (2013) and Ben’ko et al. (2013), who employed GC/MS to characterize the SB hydrolysates."
14,Degradation of cellulose in sugarcane bagasse,"3.4 Degradation of cellulose in sugarcane bagasse Cellulose solubilization achieved by ozone pretreatment of SB at different process conditions are shown in Table 1. It is seen that the highest cellulose removal was observed for the experiment 1 (40.74%), which used an ozone load of 8mgO3 min−1, a LSR of 13.3mLg−1, a pH of 11 and a reaction time of 15min as well as in the case of lignin and hemicelluloses degradation. As mentioned, the interaction between ozone and biomass occurs in a lignin-carbohydrate complex, however, ozone have to tendency to react firstly with lignin and then with cellulose due to the hydroxyl groups of the sugar molecules are easily oxidized into carbonyl groups (Mamleeva et al., 2016; Suess, 2010). During pretreatment, radicals such as superoxide anion radical (O2 −) are formed, that can act as a ‘transport medium’ to drive OH radicals into the fibers, where they can react with cellulose. Therefore, in the case of experiment 1, that is considered an advanced oxidation process the degradation of carbohydrates can also be due to the formation of non-selective hydroxyl radicals (Mussatto, 2016). The results shown in Table 1 for experiments 4, 9 and 11 showed significant levels of cellulose removal (∼35%) when an ozone load of 12.75mgO3 min−1, a LSR of 16mLg−1, a pH of 7 and a reaction time of 67.5min were adopted. From these results and taking into account the experiment 1, it is possible to infer that the water content influences the reaction between ozone and biomass. In this sense, it could be assumed that the rate of oxidation is accelerated by the hydration of cellulose hydroxyl groups and above a certain point it is retarded by the water which enters the intermicellar and interfibrillar space as described by Prabaharan et al. (2000) in the case of bleaching pulp using ozone. As mentioned by some authors (Mussatto (2016) and Travaini et al. (2015)), reactor design is one of the key factors for ozonation pretreatment, which determines ozone consumption and reaction kinetics. In this sense, it is important to emphasize that nearly all lignocellulose biomass ozonation studies reported in the literature were developed using a fixed bed reactor configuration aiming biomass delignification. However, in the present study, a mechanical mixed reactor was used, thereby allowing the addition of more water and enhancing mass transfer and ozone diffusion through the water layer on the fiber. This would favor a simultaneous solubilization of lignin and holocellulose, making the solid phase prone to enzymatic hydrolysis and ethanol production."
15,Characterization of soluble liquid fraction from ozone pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse,"3.5 Characterization of soluble liquid fraction from ozone pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse 3.5.1 Content of soluble lignin The statistical analysis of soluble lignin is presented in Pareto’s chart of the standardized effects showed in Fig. 2 a, which shows that significant effects on the variable soluble lignin are the interaction between ozone load and reaction time as well as ozone load and pH, thereby confirming that significant doses of ozone combined with longer times can release more soluble lignin in the SLF due to attack of molecular ozone on aromatic structures of SB-lignin. Fig. 2b, which was built by multiple linear model (Supplementary Table 1) by fixing the LSR at 13.3mLg−1 and the pH at 3, shows the response surface of time, ozone load and pH − the most significant independent variables − on lignin solubilization. The coefficient of determination (R 2) and RMSE for the adjusted model was 0.81 and 0.126, respectively. Then, it is possible to explain 81% soluble lignin variability with an error of 15.2%. As can be seen in Table 1 and Fig. 2a, the experiments 3 and 8 were carried out with higher contact times (120min), ozone loads greater than 8mgO3 min−1 and pH 3, yielding the highest lignin solubilization, ∼1.72g and 1.39g, respectively. As the LSR in the experiment 3 was higher in comparison to the experiment 8, it indicates that an increase in the amount of water favors lignin solubilization. On the other hand, it is known that SB ozonation process that uses lower water content enhances the ozone attack to lignin, favoring its solubility by inserting hydrophilic functional groups in its structure, as reported by Yu et al. (2011) and Travaini et al. (2013). In addition, a hypothesis to explain lignin solubilization in the experiments 3 and 8 is based on the pH dependent mechanism of ozonation. At low pH values, SB lignin is mainly attacked by molecular ozone, which is rather selective towards carbon–carbon double bonds and aromatic centers that are characteristic of lignin (Bule et al., 2013). Soluble lignin contents in the hydrolysates from ozone pretreatment of SB were smaller than those reported by Baêta et al. (2016a) in hydrolysates from hydrothermal treatment of SB. Such a difference might be due to the fact that hydrothermal pretreatment solubilizes lignin by fragmentation (mainly through hydrolysis of α- and β-alkyl- and aryl-ether bonds) depending on the process severity (relationship between time and temperature), while oxidation processes based on the ozone chemistry lead to the formation of oxidized compounds (acids, aldehydes and another by-products). A direct effect of this is the more oxidized nature of the solubilized compounds, which would tend to increase the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) during the anaerobic digestion of such hydrolysate. This might have a negative impact on methane production, as it will be discussed latter. 3.5.2 Characterization of the liquid fraction by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS) The analysis of the SLF by GC/MS was performed to identify compounds formed during the ozone pretreatment of SB at different pH values and operational conditions, thereby allowing to assess the effect of oxidation type on the accumulated by-products. The samples used for GC/MS analysis were collected at the end of ozone pretreatment at experiments 1 (ozonation in an alkaline pH), 8 (ozonation in an acidic pH) and 9 (ozonation in a neutral pH). During the ozone pretreatment of SB, ozonation by-products initially formed can further react with excess ozone, thereby generating different inhibitory compounds depending on the reactivity of the functional groups (Travaini et al., 2016b). Some oxidized by-products are potentially inhibitory to anaerobic digestion and can include a wide range of aromatic and polyaromatic compounds that may be subsequently converted into carboxylic acids, as demonstrated by GC/MS analysis of SLF. The presence of inhibitory compounds, such as glyoxalic, formic, oxalic, acetic and lactic acids as well as xylitol in the SLF from the ozone pretreatment for aspen wood and SB was also reported by Ben’ko et al. (2013) and Travaini et al. (2013) respectively. Compounds identified in the SLF generated by the experiment 1 (ozone load of 8mgOmin−1, LSR of 13.3mLg−1, reaction time of 15min and pH of 11) are shown in Fig. 3 a and numbered from 1 to 5. The main compounds identified by GC/MS were acetic acid, ethanedioic acid (oxalic acid), butanal, xylitol and 2-hexen-1-ol, respectively. It should be noted that the generation of these compounds can be explained by the reactions that take place between carbohydrates and ozone under different conditions, where the radical oxidation mechanism is favored. It is known that ozone dissolved in alkaline water generates hydroxyl radicals by superoxide formation (primary formed moiety), which reacts with carbohydrates, resulting in a random cleavage of glycosidic bonds and formation of acids, alcohols and aldehydes (Ragnar et al., 1999a; Travaini et al., 2016b). The SLF generated by the experiment 8 (ozone load of 8mgO3 min−1, LSR of 13.3mLg−1, reaction time of 120min and pH of 3) allowed the accumulation of a large number of compounds as shown in Fig. 3b. The peaks numbered from 1 to 15 were identified as acetic acid, ethanedioic acid, malonic acid, oxanilic acid, gluconic acid, propanoic acid, furanone, benzaldehyde, propanedioic acid, 2,3,4-trihydroxybutyric acid, d-erythrotetrofuranose, d-erythro-pentofuranose, xylose, D-arabinonic acid and 2-methylbutanoic acid. The generation of such compounds can be explained by the ozone reactions with aromatic compounds through molecular oxidation involving an initial electrophilic attack followed by hydroxylation of the aromatic ring, which increases the reactivity of the electrophilic substitution of the ring. Another pathway of this reaction is the ozone insertion into carbon-hydrogen bonds, resulting in the formation of functional groups such as alcohol, aldehyde and ether. For alkyl- and aryl-ethers, the reaction still results in a cleavage of ether linkages (Ragnar et al., 1999a, 1999b; Travaini et al., 2016b). Compounds identified by GC/MS analysis in the SLF generated by the experiment 9 (ozone load of 8mgO3 min−1, LSR of 13.3mLg−1, reaction time of 67.5min and pH of 7) are shown in Fig. 3c. The peaks numbered from 1 to 7 were identified as acetic acid, ethanedioic acid, butanal, propanoic acid, 2,5-furandione, xylose and 2-methyl butanoic acid. In addition to the chemical reaction pathways previously suggested, it is important to emphasize that direct ozone attack of carbohydrates is possible, which results in the formation of carbonyl and carboxyl groups, thereby confirming the presence of common carboxylic acids (e.g. acetic, ethanedioic and propanoic acids) in the SLF generated by the experiment 3."
16,Anaerobic biodegradability tests for biogas production from liquid fraction,"3.6 Anaerobic biodegradability tests for biogas production from liquid fraction 3.6.1 Biochemical methane and hydrogen potentials Fig. 4 a shows the amounts of methane and hydrogen produced for the SLF generated by the ozone pretreatment of SB at different experimental conditions. It is clear that the condition that produced more methane was that of experiment 1 (2.6Nm3 CH4 kgTOC−1). As previously discussed, advanced oxidation process and shorter reaction time prevailed during this experimental condition. The amount of methane obtained in the present study is higher than that reported by Baêta et al. (2016a) (1.56Nm3 CH4 kg TOC−1), who evaluated biogas production from AD of hemicellulose hydrolysates obtained from hydrothermal pretreatment of SB. The hypothesis that supports the efficiency of the experimental condition 1 is based on the accumulation of biodegradable compounds such as acetic acid and ethanedioic acid, which are substrates for anaerobic microorganisms involved in methane and hydrogen production. Moreover, it is important to notice that the SLF with the highest C5–C6 sugar did not lead to the highest amount of biogas, thereby implying the presence of inhibitory compounds, such as 2,5-furandione properly identified by GC/MS in the SLF from experiments 2, 8 and 10. The experimental condition 8 generated a SLF that did not produce methane or hydrogen, which might be explained by the presence of furan derivative compounds such as furanone, d-erythrotetrofuranose and d-erythro-pentofuranose, as well as a lignin derivative such as benzaldehyde. Therefore, the anaerobic consortium probably suffered with a strong inhibition caused by lignin and hemicelluloses degradation by-products, which were generated during ozonation and could not be metabolized by the anaerobic microorganisms (Barakat et al., 2012). On the other hand, and in accordance to the experimental data presented in Table 1, the center point experiments (4, 9 and 11) and experiment 8 produced the highest contents of total organic carbon (TOC) in the SLF, thereby indicating that ozone loads between 8 and 12.75 mgO3 min−1 along with reaction times higher than 67.5min led to the release of more TOC. An important difference between these experiments is the water content, expressed by different LSR values. A lower LSR (<16mLg−1), as used in the experiment 8, produced a SLF with more TOC. On the other hand, experiments with a higher LSR allowed a greater ozone attack of dissolved compounds, thereby producing a partial mineralization of the SLF (Quesada et al., 1999). This hypothesis is based on the fact that the ozone can react with water to produce hydroxyl radicals, which could increase the degradation of dissolved compounds (mainly sugars and organic acids) through mineralization with production of CO2 and H2O (Marcq et al., 2009, 2001). It should be emphasized that the TOC analysis indicates the presence of all sorts of organic compounds, being them toxic or difficult to degrade. Thus, a larger TOC concentration in the SLF does not necessarily mean a higher production of methane or hydrogen by anaerobic digestion. The anaerobic digestion of SLF generated by experiments 4, 9 and 11, which are central points of the experimental design (ozone load of 12.75mgO3 min−1, LSR of 16mLg−1, time 67.5min and pH 7), showed better results for production of methane than for hydrogen production. There has been an accumulation of the common compound 2,5-furandione in these experimental conditions, which is generated in a molecular attack of ozone in SB. This compound probably acted as an inhibitor of hydrogen producers in the anaerobic consortia. The evaluation of volatile fatty acids (VFA) accumulated at the end of the BMP and BHP tests allows one to identify any microbial growth imbalance caused by stressful conditions, such as nutritional deficiency or toxicity. Fig. 4b shows the accumulated VFA at the end of each BMP and BHP experiment. Greater accumulation of VFA during BMP was observed for the experiments 11 and 8, which exhibited a methane production of 0.28 and 0.0Nm3 CH4 kg TOC−1, respectively. These results are consistent with GC/MS analysis, which showed the presence of different types of organics acids and inhibitors (2,5-furandione) in the respective SLF. For the BHP tests, the production of H2 predominates during the acidogenic stage, where the VFAs normally accumulate as the main microbial byproducts. However, this accumulation was not entirely due to metabolism, since some of them might be ozonation by-products, as previously discussed. As a result of the toxicity caused by such by-products, a significant production of H2 was not attained during experiment 8, which SLF had the highest VFA concentration. The highest H2 productions, 0.14 and 0.18Nm3 H2 kg TOC−1, were respectively obtained for the experiments 1 and 5, which operated under the same reaction time (15 min) and LSR (13.3mLg−1). Based on these process conditions, it is possible to infer that the use of a shorter reaction time and a reduced water content is selective for the production of compounds such as formic acid and acetic acid in high concentrations, as indicated by the height of GC/MS peaks. The presence of formic and acetic acids might have led to the production of hydrogen during the acetogenic step of anaerobic digestion, according to standard biochemical reactions. The BHP values for the best conditions (experiments 1 and 5) were higher in comparison to those reported by Lazaro et al. (2014) and Jung et al. (2011). Lazaro et al. (2014) report a BHP value of 0.133Nm3 H2 kgTOC−1 using sugarcane vinasse as a substrate, whereas Jung et al. (2011) found a BHP of 0.060Nm3 H2 kgTOC−1 using alga (L. japonica) thermally pretreated. Two important parameters used to estimate the predominant metabolic pathway of acidogenic microorganisms are the HAc/Total VFA and HBut/Total VFA ratios. In the experiment 5, the values of HAc/Total VFA and HBut/Total VFA were 0.185mg HAc/mg VFA and 0.166mg HBut/mg VFA, respectively, thereby indicating that the acetic pathway predominated. These results are in good agreement with those reported by Baêta et al. (2016b), who studied a two-stage anaerobic digestion process of hemicellulose hydrolysates obtained from the hydrothermal pretreatment of SB. A hypothesis that explains the lower values for BMP and BHP for almost 50% of the experiments is the inhibitory effect caused by the organic acids and phenolic compounds generated from lignin degradation and their pH dependent speciation. Since these compounds are weak organic acids, they are probably in a non-dissociated form in the SLF, which might have facilitated their access to the inner cell. As the intracellular pH is higher, the organic acids dissociation causes a pH drop inside the cell, thereby affecting the cellular metabolic functions (Travaini et al., 2016b). The modified Gompertz model was used to model the kinetics of methane and hydrogen production for the best experiments, i.e. experiments 1 and 5. The model exhibited a satisfactory fit of the experimental data with coefficients of determination higher than 0.99. The adjusted parameters for the modified Gompertz model (λ, R m and P 0) for methane and hydrogen from the SLF generated by the experiments 1 and 5 are shown in Fig. 4c and d. It is important to notice that methane production was always higher than the hydrogen production, although the microbial consortium took a longer time (lag phase of 11days) to adapt to the SLF. In other words, methane production seems to be kinetically limited, which is consistent with the fact that the methanogens have lower growth rates than the hydrogen producers, which are more susceptible to toxic effects and adverse conditions. From an energy point of view, considering that CH4 and H2 have inferior calorific power of 34.5MJNm−3 and 10.8MJNm−3, respectively; that the BMP and BHP values for the experiment 1 were 2.6Nm3 CH4 kg TOC−1 and 0.14Nm3 H2 kg TOC−1, respectively; and that a TOC dissolution of 0.022kg TOC kg SB−1 (on dry-weight basis), the energy output obtained for experiment 1 would be 0.197MJkg SB−1 for CH4 and 0.0043 MJ kg SB−1 for H2. The production of 100g of ozone requires 1.65 MJ of energy (Travaini et al., 2016a). Then, considering that the experiment 1 consumed an amount of ozone of 0.011987kg O3kgSB−1, the energy input for the ozone pretreatment of SB was 0.196 MJ kg SB−1. These results show an energy profitability of 0.5% in the case of CH4 and a deficit of 96.9% in the case of H2. These data show there is energy viability for the proposed SB ozonation process in the case of methane production from the resulting SLF. It should be highlighted that the energy balance considered the anaerobic digestion of only the SLF. The solid fraction resulting from the ozone pretreatment of SB for the experiments 1 and 5 were subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis aiming the production of 2G bioethanol. The results obtained in the present study show that it is possible to achieve an enzymatic hydrolysis yield of 24.3% and 20.5% for experiments 1 and 5 respectively, which is in agreement with the data reported by Perrone et al. (2017) for pretreatment reaction times between 10 and 20min. On the other hand, with these yields would be possible a theoretical production of 50.9 and 40.6g ethanol per kilogram of pretreated sugarcane bagasse. Finally, if the combustion of the solid residue after enzymatic hydrolysis is considered, global energy profitability for experiment 1 is 10.53MJkg−1 SB and in the case of experiment 5 an amount of 12.90MJkg−1 SB is attained, allowing a more efficient integration of the 1G and 2G bioethanol production processes. For the biogas production data obtained in this study, a statistical tool was applied to establish the influence of the pretreatment variables on methane and hydrogen production. The results for methane production presented in Fig. 5 a, which shows that all process variables, i.e. ozone load (mg O3 min−1), LSR (mLg−1), time (min) and pH and their interactions had significant effects on gas production. For hydrogen production, a Pareto’s chart of the standardized effects (Fig. 5c) indicates that main significant variables were the interaction between pH and ozone load as well as pH and the reaction time. The adjusted response surfaces for BMP and BHP (Fig. 5b and d) were generated by a multiple linear model with specific interaction effects (shown in Supplementary Table 1) using the most significant independent variables, i.e. time, ozone load and pH. The models obtained exhibited correlations of 92.9% and 86.1% for methane and hydrogen productions, respectively. These models showed that CH4 and H2 production could be predicted with a sufficient accuracy by the significant process variables. The results obtained in the present study are better in comparison to the correlations established for the hydrothermal pretreatment of SB reported by Baêta et al. (2016a) (84%) and Ferreira et al. (2013) (57%). The condition that showed the best performance for production of both methane and hydrogen was the experiment 1, which involved a classic ozone pretreatment (ozone load of 8mgO3 min−1, time of 15min, LSR of 13.3mLg−1 and pH 11). On the other hand, it is important to notice that the production of methane and hydrogen by anaerobic digestion does not depend entirely on the SB ozonation, because the biological systems for biogas production exhibit sensitivity at different process variables such as the type of inoculum and the incubation conditions. Consequently, although it is not possible to use the absolute values of H2 or CH4 production data for the fitted models (output), at least these values indicate a trend and suggest the best pretreatment settings for the production of methane or hydrogen."
17,Conclusions,"The ozone pretreatment of SB (8mgO3 min−1, time of 15min, LSR of 13.3mL g−1 and pH 11) allowed obtaining a high hemicelluloses removal (48.28%), delignification extent (45.19%) and celluloses solubilization (40.7%) as well as SLF containing high concentrations of fermentable compounds for the subsequent production of biogas through anaerobic digestion. Inhibitory compounds for anaerobic digestion such as oxalic acid, butanal, xylitol, furanone, benzaldehyde, d-erythrotetrofuranose, d-erythro-pentofuranose and 2,5-furandione were identified by GC/MS. The best experimental conditions yielded a production of 2.6Nm3 CH4 kg TOC−1 and 0.18Nm3 H2 kg TOC−1 with an energy profitability of 0.5% for methane production and an energy deficit of 96.9% in the case of H2 as a fuel. Finally, the ozone pretreatment could be energetically offset when considering the use of the cellulose-rich solid fraction (generated in the biomass pretreatment stage) for the production of ethanol 2G as well as the combustion of solid residues obtained after enzymatic hydrolysis."
