0,Introduction,"Vegetables are widely used in the world food and pharmaceutical industries, as well as in obtaining cosmetological, perfumery and agricultural products, among others (Vasconcelos et al., 2017). In addition, in recent years, chemical reactions using plant cell cultures and part of plants as biocatalysts have received great attention. There are numerous examples esterification (Mehrasbi et al., 2017; Mohammady et al., 2016), transesterification (Tacias-Pascacio et al., 2017), hydrolysis (Silva et al., 2016, 2017), oxy-reduction (Kecskemeti and Gaspar, 2017; Naldi et al., 2017) and alkylation (Gholami et al., 2018; Prasad et al., 2015) reactions what occur under enzymatic control. The biocatalytic transformations using whole cells can be applied in phytoremediation of organic pollutants reduction of carbon-carbon double bonds, ketones and aldehydes, lactonization, addition of hydrogen cyanide, hydroxylation, hydrolysis of esters and oxidations reactions. Among the many applications, we can mention the current interest in the preparation of chiral alcohols from prochiral ketones by the use of plant systems: cell cultures, derived enzymes and intact plant materials (Aldabalde et al., 2007; Andrade et al., 2006; Assunção et al., 2008; Banerjee et al., 2012; Cordell et al., 2007; Ferreira et al., 2012a, 2012b; Suárez-Franco et al., 2010; Yadav et al., 2002). These latter systems offer advantages with respect to plant cell or enzymes preparations. For example, the use of expensive cofactors is eliminated since the whole cell automatically provides this need (Bizerra et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2012). Others important characteristics of biocatalyst are their frequently lower cost and high versatility and efficiency in addition the highly desirable chemical aspects such as chemoselectivity regioselectivity and enantioselectivity (Assunção et al., 2008; Banerjee et al., 2012; Bezerra et al., 2017; Bizerra et al., 2010; Carvalho et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2017; Bertini et al., 2012) Recent studies show that a great number of the drugs produced are chiral, some having about two or more chiral centers (Cordell et al., 2007; Regina et al., 2001). Because of the burgeoning need for chiral drugs derived from prochiral precursors, interest of industries agrochemical and pharmaceutical in using enzymes for such transformations has steadily increased (Bussamara et al., 2010; Tan et al., 2016; Wei et al., 2016). Recognizing the ease of use of fresh intact plant material for reactions with organic substrates, many researchers performed efficient reductions of various prochiral ketones (Alves et al., 2015; Patil, 2015; Yang et al., 2008). Thus, using Daucus carot root several substituted acetophenones were subjected to the reduction with excellent yields (70–80%) and optical purity (>90%) of alcohol having the S configuration (Yadav et al., 2002); using Ximenia americana grains, 2,4-dichloroacetophenone was converted to the corresponding (S)-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethanol with >99% enantiomeric excess (e.e.) in 53% yield (da Silva et al., 2018). On the other hand, Manihot esculenta afforded 56% yield of the alcohol (R)-(4-bromophenyl)ethanol with 89% e.e. from 4-bromoacetophenone (Andrade et al., 2006). Similar to ketones, aldehydes biocatalytic reduction is one of the most important and pratical reaction for alcohols (Andrade et al., 2006) which can be transformed to synthetise industrially important chemicals. Thus, several plant species in the form of intact materials have been used to reduce aldehydes. The intact system (sugar cane juice) of S. officinarum produced alcohols with excellent yields, in some cases greater than the results reported for D. carot and comparable to those obtained with M. esculenta, M. dulcis and Z. rouxii. For example, vanillin which was not affected by the two Manihot species was reduced to the 3-metoxi-4-hydroxi(1-phenyl)ethanol by S. offinarum in 90% yield, while the furfuryl aldehyde gave the corresponding alcohol in 100% yield. However, S. offinarum showed no reaction with benzamide (Assunção et al., 2008). Sinapis alba L. (yellow mustard) belonging to the Brassicaceae family is a plant native to North Africa, Europe and Western Asia, but well adapted to semi-arid climate (Al-Qudah et al., 2011; Alcántara et al., 2011; Damian, 2011; Dukarska and Janina Łęcka, 2011; Ildikó et al., 2006; Bradford, 2002; Sáez-Bastante et al., 2016; Soltani and Farzaneh, 2014). Yellow mustard seeds are used in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries (Dukarska and Janina Łęcka, 2011). The medicinal importance is due to its antineoplastic, antimicrobial and insecticidal activities (Hontanaya et al., 2015). These factors, allied to the abundance of plant material still available, represent a synthetic alternative that is quite feasible from the economic and ecological point of view (Bizerra et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2017, 2018; Bertini et al., 2012). Herein, we present studies on the reduction of a series of prochiral ketones in order to prepare optically enriched alcohols in a green fashion, using parts of plant as biocatalyst, with addition of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and with pH control. Although the monomer is quite toxic and carcinogenic to animals, the polymer (PVP) is completely harmless and inert to humans. In addition, there are several studies on biocatalysis that demonstrate their action in increasing the reaction yield. We also tested the ability of S. albas in the reduction of others carbonyl compounds."
1,Experimental,
2,General methods,"2.1 General methods The solvents were analytical grade purchased from Synth and were used without further purification; Bradford's reagent and sodium borohydride (NaBH4) were purchased from commercial Aldrich and Prosynth, respectively. Chemical reactions were monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using precoated plates (silica gel 60 F254 Sigma and silica gel 60, code 1094, Vetec) and visualized by spraying with 0.75 M vanillin−HClO4 / EtOH as the detection agent under heating at 100 °C. Silica gel 60 (Vetec) was used for column chromatography having dichloromethane (Synth) as the eluent. GC analysis were performed on a Shimadzu GC–MS model QP 2010 Plus using Rtx-5MS capillary column (95% dimethylpolysiloxane and 5% diphenyl) of 30 m, 0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.1 μm thickness of fixed phase film; He was used as carrier gas (1.0 mL / min); the injector and detector temperatures were 240 and 280 °C, respectively; column conditions: 60 °C to 80 °C at 5 °C min−1, remaining for 3 min; then from 80 °C min−1 to 280 °C at 30 °C min-1 remaining at this temperature for 10 min, using He as a drag gas with a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1. The analysis with the mass detector was in scan mode with analysis time in 23.67 min; the mass spectra recorded in the range of 35 to 500 Daltons per electron impact (EMIE) with ionization energy of 70 eV (voltage of 1.5 KV), quadrupole type analyzer and source of ions at 240 °C. The enantiomeric excess of the bioreduction products of the prochiral ketones (1a-8a and 13a) were determined by Shimadzu LC-20AT High Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC), pump L201147, U-Vis Shimadzu SPD-M20A detector equipped with a chiral OB-H and OD-H (150 x 4.6 mm) column. In the analysis, Hexane / Isopropanol mixture was used as the mobile phase by varying the composition there of according to the needs of the analysis. The enzymatic reactions were performed on the Cientec CT-165 agitator table and the mass determinations were performed with the Shimadzu AUY220 analytical balance."
3,Biocatalyst,2.2 Biocatalyst Seeds of Sinapis alba L (yellow mustard) were purchased from food stores in Fortaleza – Ceará.
4,Initial procedures,"2.3 Initial procedures The seeds were washed in water and then maintained in 0.2% sodium hypochlorite aqueous solution for 20 min. Subsequently, they were washed with distilled water until odor removal of the sodium hypochlorite solution, dried at room temperature (30 °C) for 24 h and reduced to tiny grains using a sterilized cutter. The material was left at room temperature for about 2 h, thereby yielding the biocatalyst used in all experiments. 2.3.1 Protein content The crushed seed suspension (15.9 g) in distilled water (50 mL) was stirred for 72 h at 150 rpm at room temperature on an orbital shaker. After filtration, the aqueous solution was subjected to a methodology for determination of total estimated protein content using the Bradford (Bradford, 1976) method: 110.00 mg / mL. 2.3.2 General procedures In order to optimize the reaction conditions, as substrate model for enantioselective bioreduction reaction, was selected acetophenone (1) (Scheme 1 ). We carried out the bioreduction testing a series of parameters (substrate concentration: 0.05 g; biocatalyst mass: 5, 10, 15 g, 20 and 25 g; reaction time: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 96 and 120 h; temperature: 30, 35, 40 and 50 °C; stirring speed: 150, 170, 200 and 220 rpm; pH 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0 [buffer solution (Na2HPO4 / KH2PO4)] and reaction with or without the presence of co-solvent (Isopropylalcohol). The best result, taking into account yield and enantiomeric excess, was achieved using 0.05 g of substrate and 15 g of the biocatalyst, at 30 °C for 72 h, under 200 rpm and pH 6.0 in the absence of PVP or in the presence of 1 g of the PVP."
5,Biocatalyzed transformations,"2.4 Biocatalyzed transformations In separate experiments, 50 mg was used for all selected substrates (ketones, aldehydes and amide). The substrates were added to a suppository previously prepared from fresh seeds (15 g) in water. (50 mL) and the reaction mixtures were shaken on an orbital shaker (200 rpm) at room temperature (27) for 72 h. The final suspensions were then treated by partition chromatography and adsorption chromatography (column). The identity of the products was confirmed by GC–MS analysis and chiral column HPLC as compared to racemic mixtures of alcohols previously obtained from traditional chemical reactions."
6,Results and discussion,"The initial experiment was conducted to determine the total proteins in the enzymatic system by the Bradford method (Bradford, 1976). The aqueous extract of the seeds of Sinapis alba L presented a considerable value (110.00 mg / mL) of soluble proteins compared those found in others biocatalysts such as Lens Culinaris L. (1.38 mg/ mL) (Ferreira et al., 2012b). Considering that enzymes are made up of proteins, these results highlight the possibility of enzymes in the extract."
7,Reduction of ketones,"3.1 Reduction of ketones Previously experiment, showed the reduction of acetophenone (1) by Sinapis alba seeds fragments. After testing various reaction parameters (mass of the biocatalyst, temperature, time, pH and influence of cosolvent), this ketone was transformed into the corresponding chiral alcohol (1a) in 72 h in average yield of 68.5% and 53% e.e. (Table 1 ). The good yield (68.5%) in the reduction of 1 was indicative of the relatively high presence of reducing enzymes in the high total protein content (110.00 mg / mL) in the S. alba seed extract. This result enabled the biocatalyst to reduce other substrates. Thus, the reactions with acetophenone derivatives 2-8 (Scheme 1) and other substrates (9-14) (Fig. 1 ) were carried out under the same conditions of acetophenone reduction (005 g of substrate, 15 g of the biocatalyst, 200 rpm, pH 6.0, at room temperature for 72 h). Acetophenone and substituted acetophenones were subjected to the reduction protocol and the progress of the reaction was monitored by GC analysis. The results are summarized in Table 1. In almost all the cases, the products alcohols had S configuration, which is in agreement with Prelog’s rule. The reduction of the acetophenone (1) gave good yield (ca. 68.5%) with moderate e.e. (ca. 53%). For acetophenone derivatives, yields were low (4–18%: 5, 7 and 8) to moderate (28–40%: 3, 4 and 6), except for 2 in 81% yield. The e.e. values were in the range 65–97%, except for 6 (5%). Electronic and steric influences were observed in the course of the reduction as a function of the presence and location of different substituents on the aromatic ring. For example, 4-Nitroacetophenone (2), with an electron-withdrawing group (nitro) located at the para position has been reduced to a greater extent than 3-Nitroacetophenone (6). On the other hand, 4-Methoxyacetophenone (5), with a electron-donating group (methoxy) also located at the para position produced alcohol 5a in the lowest yield (4.10%). Possible electronic and steric effects due methoxy and methyl groups at the orto position, would justify the low conversion in the cases of 7 and 8, respectively (Table 1). Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is a high molecular weight polymer that has the ability to act as a stabilizing agent in crude plant extracts maintaining the enzymatic activity for a long time (Fatibello-Filho and Vieira, 2002). According to Zeraik et al. (2008), he acts as a protector by removing natural phenolic compounds from the enzymatic extracts, avoiding oxidations by the enzymes peroxidases. Also, according to Zeraik et al. (2008), the good performance of this protective agent is attributed to the hydrogen bond formation that it establishes with natural substrates. Based on this evidence, the substrates 1-14 were subjected to the same reduction protocol, however, in the presence of PVP. In general, compared to the reactions in the absence of PVP, the results (yied and e.e.) were random (Table 1). However, 4-nitroacetophenone (2) afforded the (S)-alcohol in higher yield (81%) and e.e. (71%), while for compounds 5 and 6, the opposite stereochemistry was observed for the respective alcohols, as predicted by Prelog’s rule. Since PVP forms hydrogen bonds with water molecules, the interactions of the substrate with the biocatalyst with and without the presence of this polymer occur in different ways, possibly justifying obtaining the different isomers at pH 6.0."
8,Biorreduction reactions from others carbonyl compounds,"3.2 Biorreduction reactions from others carbonyl compounds The Sinapis alba reductase enzyme system was also evaluated for an aromatic cyclic ketone (13), an aromatic amide (14) as weel as extended to the aromatic aldehydes (9 – 11) including the α,β-unsaturated cinnamic aldehyde (12) (Fig. 1). As expected, electron rich aldehyde (11) was reduced to a lesser extent than others (9, 10 and 12). The ketone (13) gave the alcohol in low yield however with excellent e.e., whereas benzamide (14) was not affected by this system (Assunção et al., 2008; Ferreira et al., 2012a). Low chemoselectivity was observed for enzymatic reduction of cinnamic aldehyde where three products were formed as also observed in previous studies (Assunção et al., 2008; Ferreira et al., 2012b; Machado et al., 2006). The reduction process occurred only at the carbonyl group with production of 12a (ca. 52.16%) as well as simultaneously at the carbonyl group and in the olefinic double bond to afford 12b (ca. 31.43%). The third product was caused by the unexpected oxidation of the aldehyde group to the carboxylic acid 12c (16.40%) (Table 2 )."
9,Conclusions,"The biocatalytic reactions performed in this work using the seeds of Sinapis alba L. as a biocatalyst showed satisfactory results. In the reaction from prochiral aromatic ketones alcohols of good enantiomeric purity were obtained. In the case of ketone substrates with substituents in the meta position, the formation of the S isomer (Prelog product) at pH 6.0 was observed, while the R-isomer (anti-Prelog product) was obtained in the presence of PVP. In addition to the reduction of the carbonyl groups of the organic aldehyde and ketone functions, the reduction of the nitro group and the amine function were also observed in the presence of PVP. This reduction is interesting because compounds containing nitros group are toxic and resistant to biodegradation. The results obtained in the reduction of the carbonyl compounds were random and there were no highlights in the yields in the absence or presence of PVP. This, probably, indicates a low presence of phenolic compounds in the seeds of S. Alba. The seeds of the plant under study demonstrated promising potential in obtaining intermediate alcohols used in the synthesis of products of the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and cosmetic industries through a process that used a biodegradable catalytic system and that operate under mild reaction conditions, resulting in lower demand energy for its realization. To our knowledge, this is the first study using the seeds of S. alba (intact plant systems) as a biocatalyst in chemical transformations.
