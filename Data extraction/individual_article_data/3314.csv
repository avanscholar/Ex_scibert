0,Introduction,"Ammonia borane (AB), BH3NH3, is a promising chemical hydrogen storage material for use with automotive fuel cell systems because of its high H2 intrinsic material capacity and because the dehydrogenation reaction is exothermic. Ammonia borane is a stable solid at room temperature and melts at a temperature between 110 and 114 °C [1,2]. Storing H2 on-board in the form of solid AB poses many practical problems that are generic to any solid fuel that may be considered for transportation and that needs to be regenerated in a central plant off-board the vehicle. These include transportation of the fuel from a central plant to the refueling stations, loading of the solid fuel into the vehicle's fuel tank and unloading of the spent fuel, refueling of fuel tanks that are partially empty, achieving high packing densities, controlling H2 release and peak temperatures, and conveying the solids to the hydrogen generation reactor. Storing H2 in the form of a liquid AB overcomes many of these difficulties and presents some advantages of a familiar liquid fuel infrastructure. Himmelberger et al has demonstrated that AB can be dissolved in an ionic solvent that catalyzes its decomposition by thermolysis with the release of up to 2.5H2 equivalents at temperatures below 200 °C [3]. It is not desirable to release all three equivalents of H2 since regenerating AB from the product BN, a ceramic, is difficult [4,5]. It is also possible to release H2 by catalyzed hydrolysis [6] or hydrothermolysis [7] but the process of converting the product B–O bonds to B–H bonds is energy intensive [8]. The structure and composition of the dehydrogenated products, BNHx, vary significantly with the extent of hydrogen release, but in general x is greater than one but less than two. The dehydrogenation of AB is not directly reversible, however, by simply reacting BNHx with H2 gas because the dehydrogenation reaction is both enthalpically and entropically favorable [4].Therefore, the BNHx must be chemically regenerated off-board. Many chemical pathways and permutations of pathways to regenerate AB from BNHx have been investigated. Much of the early activity to select or reject potential chemical pathways was guided by theory and the computation of reaction energetics [9]. Several regeneration cycles have been demonstrated [9], and the lessons learned have led to much simpler regeneration schemes. Based on this past work, we have constructed and analyzed flowsheets for three different AB regeneration schemes, which are discussed in this paper. In the first scheme, proposed by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), a single reactor is used to digest BNHx with a thiol and to reduce the products to AB with tin metal hydride (MH). Solid AB is recovered as a precipitate, and the thiol is recycled by reacting with formic acid. The MH-COOH product is thermally decomposed to recover the MH while producing CO2, which is hydrogenated to yield formic acid [10]. The flowsheet for the second scheme, proposed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), consists of four steps: (1) BNHx digestion by one of two approaches, one that preserves the B–H bonds in the spent AB and the other that recovers the residual H2 in the spent AB; (2) reduction of the intermediate triphenoxy borane with a metal hydride; (3) formation and recycling of the metal hydride; and (4) addition of NH3 to form AB [11]. The third scheme, also proposed by LANL, involves a single-reactor process in which BNHx is reacted with hydrazine (N2H4) in NH3 to form AB [12]. The complete flowsheet closes the cycle by including the processes used to produce hydrazine. The three regeneration schemes are in various stages of development. Some, but not all, of the steps in the first two schemes have been demonstrated in the laboratory. The third scheme has been proven successfully with high yields of AB. Using the information provided by the material developers, and combining it with additional data from the literature, we have calculated the process fuel energy used, primary energy consumed, and greenhouse gas emissions in each step of the total fuel cycle and the overall well-to-tank energy efficiency. The fuel cycle analysis accounted for losses, inefficiencies, and energy consumption in upstream processes that recover and convert the energy feedstock to process fuel. We performed single-variable sensitivity analyses to identify the major fuel consuming processes, and the impact of varying the process assumptions on meeting the DOE 2015 performance target for well-to-tank efficiency of 60% or higher [13]."
1,Regeneration of ammonia borane using thiol,"The first regeneration scheme uses dithiol ligand for the digestion step, and tin hydride as the reducing agent. We constructed and analyzed an engineering process flowsheet (Fig. 1 ) for regenerating H3BNH3 from BNH2 using the process chemistry developed at LANL [8]. The overall scheme is represented by the following chemical reactions. Digestion and reduction BNH2 + (3/2)α SCatH2 + γ H2SnBu2 + ½ γ HSnBu3 → BH3NH3 + ½ H2 + 3/2 (α − 1) (SCatH2) + (γ − 1) H2SnBu2 + ½ (γ − 1) HSnBu3 + (SCat)SnBu2 + ½ (SCatH)SnBu3 Thiol recycle (SCat)SnBu2 + ½ (SCatH)SnBu3 + (5/2)β HCOOH + (γ − 1) H2SnBu2 + ½ (γ − 1) HSnBu3 → 3/2 (SCatH2) + 5/2(β − 1) HCOOH + (COOH)2SnBu2 + ½ (COOH)SnBu3 + (γ − 1) H2SnBu2 + ½ (γ − 1) HSnBu3 Metal hydride recycle (COOH)2SnBu2 + ½ (COOH)SnBu3 + (γ − 1) H2SnBu2 + ½ (γ − 1) HSnBu3 → γ H2SnBu2 + ½ γ HSnBu3 + 5/2 CO2 Formic acid reformation 5/2 CO2 + 5/2 H2 → 5/2 HCOOH Net reaction BNH2 + 2H2 → BH3NH3 where α, β and γ are stoichiometry ratios. The flowsheet was based on the concept of achieving high yields by setting up process conditions, in which the material to be converted forms the limiting species that is reacted with reagents in excess amounts (α, β and γ greater than 1). In the first step, we consider that a single reactor digests spent ammonia borane with thiol (SCatH2) and reduces the products with tin metal hydride (H2SnBu2 and HSnBu3). Solid ammonia borane is recovered as a precipitate. In the second step, thiol is recycled by reacting the products from the digestion step with formic acid. In the metal hydride recycle step, the metal hydride-COOH product is thermally decomposed to recover the metal hydride while producing CO2. We applied an integrated process, developed by BP Chemicals [14], for producing formic acid from CO2 and H2 to complete the regeneration cycle. The BP process requires significantly less energy than current commercial methods [15]. Recent approach [16] in formic acid reformation using CO2, H2, and an iridium catalyst could also be more energy efficient than commercial methods. A schematic of the BP patented process is depicted in Fig. 2 . In the first stage, triethylamine, CO2 and H2 react in a high boiling solvent (tetraethylene glycol) at 60 bar in the presence of a transition metal catalyst to form triethylammonium formate salt. In the second stage, the catalyst and unreacted triethylamine are removed and recycled to the first stage. In the third stage, the triethylammonium formate salt undergoes base interchange by reacting with a second base (1-n-butylimidazole) to form a second formate salt (1-n-butylimidazolium formate). In the fourth stage, the 1-n-butylimidazolium formate is thermally decomposed to yield formic acid and 1-n-butylimidazole, which is recycled to the third stage. Note that at present, the most widely used method for producing formic acid is by hydrolysis of methyl formate, which is formed from CO and water [15]. We calculated the energy consumption and well-to-tank (WTT) efficiency for the ammonia borane regeneration and formic acid production flowsheets described above. We assumed that up to 30% thermal integration can be achieved in the distillation columns. The complete WTT analysis of energy consumption included energy requirements for the production of hydrogen (by SMR), regeneration of AB from BNHx, and delivery of the AB solution to the vehicle refueling station. For our analyses, the database in GREET [17] was used for the various process fuels (natural gas, diesel fuel, electricity, etc.) to calculate the specific energy for conversion of some typical feedstocks to the process fuels, thereby accounting for losses, inefficiencies, and energy consumption in the upstream processes. We used the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected 2015 U.S. grid mix to assess the primary fuels used and the corresponding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the production of electricity used in the hydrogen production and the AB regeneration processes [18]. In this projected grid mix, 2.5% of electricity is produced using residual oil, 22.7% using natural gas, 48.6% from coal, 16.6% from nuclear, 1.3% from biomass, and 8.3% from other renewables (mainly hydroelectric). The weighted electric conversion efficiency (primary energy to electricity) at the user site, inclusive of 8% transmission loss, for this grid mix is 32.2%. Generally, more than one type of feedstock is consumed in producing a process fuel and this breakdown is needed to estimate the emissions of greenhouse gases. For hydrogen production, we assumed that hydrogen is produced at 20 bar by steam methane reforming (SMR) of natural gas at a large central plant with 73% efficiency. We assumed a heat transfer efficiency of 85% in thermal processes where thermal energy is provided by natural gas combustion. We used performance data of large vacuum pumps from industrial sources to calculate electricity requirement. We assumed that the AB solution is delivered to the forecourt by diesel trucks capable of delivering 2000 kg of hydrogen on a 100-km round trip distance. The trucks were assumed to have 6 miles per gallon fuel economy. Table 1 shows the process energy required to produce formic acid needed to regenerate the equivalent of 1 kg H2 in ammonia borane. We assumed a formic acid yield of 75%, reflux ratio of 0.5 in distillation steps, and a gas recirculation ratio (H2 and CO2) of 10. From this analysis, formic acid production alone consumes 144 MJ of thermal energy (101 MJ with 30% heat recovery/integration) and 5.8 kWh of electricity per kg of H2 regenerated in AB. The total primary energy consumed to produce H2, regenerate the spent AB and deliver 1 kg H2 in AB is 507 MJ without heat integration (427 MJ with 30% heat integration). The primary energy refers to the amount of energy in feedstocks such as petroleum, natural gas, coal, uranium ore, hydropower, solar energy, and biomass. The WTT efficiency is 23.6% (28% with heat integration). Hydrogen production accounts for 35% of total primary energy and AB regeneration consumes 65%, while fuel delivery to the forecourt is only a small fraction, <0.5%, of the total. Formic acid production is the most energy intensive step, accounting for >40% of the total primary energy. We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of varying the stoichiometry ratios of reagents used in the chemical reactions from 1 to 3, and the reflux ratio in distillation columns from 0.3 to 1. As shown in Fig. 3 , the sensitivity analyses were carried out for two scenarios of thermal energy integration in the distillation columns, with 30% savings and without such savings. Our estimate of the WTT efficiency is 20–28% if there is no thermal integration in the distillation columns, which can be increased by about 4 percentage points with 30% energy savings in the distillation columns."
2,Regeneration of ammonia borane using alcohols,"The second regeneration scheme uses alcohols, including both mono- and multi-dentate alcohols, in the digestion step. A wide variety of alcohols has been screened, including methanol, tert-butanol, catechol, pinacol, and phenol [9]. Tert-Butanol has proven to be the most promising alcohol for digestion of spent fuel generated via thermolysis [19]. Two digestion schemes have been proposed, one that preserves the B–H bonds in BNHx by digesting it with a stoichiometric amount of tert-butanol in tetrahydrofuran, THF (C4H8O), and the other that recovers the residual H2 by digesting BNHx with excess tert-butanol without additional THF co-solvent. We constructed and analyzed two engineering flowsheets for regenerating spent AB using this process chemistry developed at PNNL [11]. The process consists of four steps: (1) digestion of spent AB by one of two approaches, one that preserves the B–H bonds in the spent AB and the other that recovers the residual H2 in the spent AB; (2) reduction of the intermediate triphenoxy borane with a metal hydride; (3) formation and recycling of the metal hydride; and (4) addition of NH3 to form of AB."
3,B–H bonds preservation approach,"3.1 B–H bonds preservation approach The overall scheme is represented by the following chemical reactions that take place in reactors identified in Fig. 4 . Digestion D1. BNH2 + 2t-BuOH + α C4H8O → HB(O-t-Bu)2 + NH3 + α C4H8O D2. HB(O-t-Bu)2 + α C4H8O + 1/3 β W → 1/3 WBH3 + 1/3(β − 1)W + ⅔ B(O-t-Bu)3 + α C4H8O D3. 1/3(β − 1) W + ⅔ B(O-t-Bu)3 + α C4H8O + 2 γ PhOH → ⅔ B(OPh)3 + 1/3(β − 1) W + 2 t-BuOH + 2(γ − 1) PhOH + α C4H8O Metal hydride formation M1. 2 MX + 2δ Y + (λ + 2) H2 + 2σ Z → 2 HYX + 2MH + 2(δ − 1) Y + λ H2 + 2σ Z Reduction with metal hydride R1. ⅔ B(OPh)3 + [1/3(β − 1) + 1)] W + 2 t-BuOH + 2(γ − 1) PhOH + 2MH + 2(δ − 1)Y + 2 B(OPh)3 → 2 MB(OPh)4 + ⅔ WBH3 + 1/3 β W + 2(δ-1)Y + 2 t-BuOH + 2(γ − 1) PhOH R2. 2 MB(OPh)4 + 2(δ − 1)Y + 2 t-BuOH + 2(γ − 1) PhOH + 2 HYX → 2t-BuOH + 2 γ PhOH + 2 MX + 2δ Y +2 B(OPh)3 Ammoniation to form BH 3 NH 3 A1. WBH3 + (ϕ + 1) NH3 + ɛ W → BH3NH3 + ϕNH3 + (ɛ + 1) W Net BNH2 + 2H2 → BH3NH3 where α, β, γ, δ, ɛ and ϕ are stoichiometry ratios; “W” is an amine, phosphine, or sulfide; “X” is BF4, halogen or PhO; “Y” is a base; “Z” is a non-polar solvent; and “M” is a transition metal. The flowsheet is based on the concept of achieving high yields by setting up process conditions in which the material to be converted forms the limiting species that is reacted with reagents in excess amounts (α, β, γ, δ, ɛ, and > ϕ1).THF solvent is needed in the digestion reactors to reduce the viscosity of B(O-t-Bu)3, which is an oil. Non-polar solvent “Z” is added to the metal hydride reactor to precipitate out HYX. Note that in this flowsheet, a chemical method to separate “MX” and “Y” has not yet been formulated. It was assumed that additional research will lead to a viable separation method. In this regeneration scheme, for each mole of WBH3 converted to BH3NH3 when reacted with ammonia, 1/3 mol WBH3 is formed during digestion and 2/3 mol is formed during reduction. Table 2 shows the process energy requirement to regenerate 1 kg H2 released by the thermolysis of H3BNH3 to BNH2. We assumed a stoichiometric ratio of 2 for reagents and a reflux ratio of 0.5 in the distillation columns. The total thermal energy requirement was then calculated to be 204 MJ, of which about 50% is consumed in the digestion step, 25% in reduction, and 25% in metal hydride formation. This total thermal energy requirement decreased to 143 MJ with 30% heat recovery in the distillation columns. The total primary energy consumed to produce, store, and deliver 1 kg H2 in AB was calculated to be 382 MJ without heat recovery and 320 MJ with 30% heat recovery. The WTT efficiency was calculated to be 31% without heat recovery and 37% with heat recovery. Hydrogen production accounts for 46% of total primary energy and regeneration accounts for 54%, while the energy consumed to deliver fuel to the forecourt is less than 1% of the total primary energy. The calculations excluded the energy that is needed to separate “MX” and base “Y” in line 8 of the flowsheet. Fig. 5 shows the results of the sensitivity analyses for WTT when the reactant stoichiometry and reflux ratio were varied independently."
4,Residual H2 recovery approach,"3.2 Residual H2 recovery approach The overall scheme is represented by the following chemical reactions that take place in the reactors identified in Fig. 6 . Digestion D1. BNH2 + 3α t-BuOH → B(O-t-Bu)3 + 3(α − 1) t-BuOH + NH3 + H2 D2. B(O-t-Bu)3 + 3(α − 1) t-BuOH + 3γ PhOH → B(OPh)3 + 3α t-BuOH + 3(γ − 1) PhOH Metal hydride formation M1. 3 MX + 3δ Y + (λ + 3) H2 + 3σ Z → 3 HYX + 3MH + 3(δ − 1) Y + λ H2 + 3σ Z Reduction with metal hydride R1. 4 B(OPh)3 + βW + 3MH + 3(δ − 1)Y → 3 MB(OPh)4 + WBH3 + (β − 1) W + 3(δ − 1) Y R2. 3 MB(OPh)4 + 3(δ − 1) Y + 3 HYX → 3 PhOH + 3 MX + 3δ Y +3 B(OPh)3 Ammoniation to amonia borane A1. WBH3 + ϕNH3 → BH3NH3 + (ϕ − 1) NH3 + W Net BNH2 + 2H2 → BH3NH3 Excess amount of tert-butanol serves as solvent in the digestion reactors and no other co-solvent is needed. Using excess amount of tert-butanol favors protonolysis of the digestion product HB(O-t-Bu)2 that releases the residual H2 to form B(O-t-Bu)3. Ammonia is recovered from the NH3/H2 gas mixture by cryogenic separation. Ammonia liquid is pressurized to >10 bar, reacts with WBH3 to form BH3NH3 in the ammoniation reactor. In this regeneration scheme, WBH3 is formed in the reduction step only, compared to 2/3 mol for each mole BH3NH3 regenerated in the BH bond preservation approach. We assumed a stoichiometric ratio of 2 for reagents and a reflux ratio of 0.5 in the distillation columns. The calculated total thermal energy requirement was 317 MJ per kg H2 regenerated (222 MJ with 30% heat recovery). In addition, 2.4 kWh of electricity was needed for ammonia liquefaction. The WTT efficiency was calculated to be 22% without heat recovery and 27% with heat recovery. The calculations excluded the energy that is needed to separate “MX” and base “Y” in line 8 of the flowsheet."
5,Regeneration of ammonia borane using hydrazine,"In this single-reactor scheme, spent AB is reacted with hydrazine (N2H4) in liquid ammonia [11]. BNH2 + N2H4 → BH3NH3 + N2 The test results show that high AB yields are obtained when hydrazine is the limiting agent, and that the reaction produces no byproducts. Any unreacted BNH2 can be separated from the solution by decanting and it can then be recycled to the reactor. Pure AB is obtained by evaporation of liquid ammonia from the product solution. Two additional flow sheets were constructed to close the cycles by considering the two leading commercial processes, Bayer Ketazine [20] and PCUK [21], for producing the hydrazine needed for this scheme. In the Bayer Ketazine process, shown schematically in Fig. 7 , chlorine reacts with dilute sodium hydroxide to form sodium hypochlorite and sodium chloride. This hypochlorite solution reacts at 30–40 °C under slight pressure with aqueous ammonia and acetone at a molar ratio of 1:2:20 to produce dimethyl ketazine solution. Excess ammonia and acetone are removed in columns and recycled to the reactor. The dimethyl ketazine solution is hydrolyzed at 10 atm to form acetone and hydrazine. The primary reactions are as follow. 2NaOH + Cl2 → NaOCl + NaCl + H2O 2NH3 + NaOCl + (CH3)2CO → (CH3)2CNNH2 + NaCl + 2H2O (CH3)2CNNH2 + (CH3)2CO → (CH3)2CNNC(CH3)2 + H2O (CH3)2CNNC(CH3)2 + 3H2O → 2(CH3)2CO + N2H4.H2O The net reaction is 2NH3 + 2NaOH + Cl2 → N2H4.H2O + 2NaCl + H2O The PCUK-Peroxide process (Fig. 8 ) utilizes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) instead of chlorine or hypochlorite to oxidize NH3. The reaction is carried out in the presence of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) at atmospheric pressure and 50 °C. The molar ratio in the feed of H2O2:MEK:NH3 is 1:2:4. The reaction involves forming an intermediate that is able to oxidize ammonia to a hydrazone, which, with excess ketone, forms ketazine. The purified ketazine is hydrolyzed under pressure to give hydrazine and ketone; the latter is taken overhead and recycled. The primary reactions are as follows. NH3 + H2O2 + (CH3)(C2H5)CO → (CH3)(C2H5)CONH + 2H2O NH3 + (CH3)(C2H5)CONH → (CH3)(C2H5)CNNH2 + H2O (CH3)(C2H5)CNNH2 + (CH3)(C2H5)CO → (CH3)(C2H5)CNNC(CH3)(C2H5) + H2O (CH3)(C2H5)CNNC(CH3)(C2H5) + 3H2O → 2(CH3)(C2H5)CO + N2H4.H2O The net reaction is 2NH3 + H2O2 → N2H4.H2O + H2O The economics of these two hydrazine production processes depend on the relative costs of chlorine, cautic soda, and hydrogen peroxide. The PCUK process, however, has many advantages over the other processes, including no salt by-products, high yields, lower energy consumption, and no aqueous effluent treatment [21]. Table 3 shows the primary energy consumed to regenerate 1 kg H2 in AB by the PCUK and Bayer Ketazine pathways. In both options, ammonia is one of the primary feed materials and the source of hydrogen to regenerate spent AB. We adopted Uhde's most advanced energy-efficient ammonia production technology [22] in our well-to-tank analyses. The overall feed and energy consumption is ∼28 kJ/kg-NH3, compared to ∼36 kJ/kg NH3 for the average U.S. ammonia production plants [23]. On the basis of regenerating 1 kg-H2 in spent AB by the PCUK pathway, we estimated that 263 MJ of primary energy is consumed to produce NH3 and 331 MJ to produce H2O2 as feed materials for hydrazine production. We estimated that the PCUK process requires 227 MJ and the AB regeneration steps require 149 MJ of primary energy. Overall, the total primary energy is 970 MJ, giving a WTT efficiency of 12.4%. The mix of process fuels consists of ∼90% natural gas and ∼10% electricity. On the basis of regenerating 1 kg-H2 in spent AB by the Bayer Ketazine pathway, we estimated that 935 MJ of primary energy is consumed to produce NaOH/Cl2 as feed materials for the hydrazine production. The majority of the energy is in the form of electricity to power the electrolyzers. The NaOH/Cl2 production process co-produces H2 which is used for making NH3. The net amount of primary energy needed for NH3 production is 174 MJ/kg-H2. We estimated that 246 MJ is consumed to produce hydrazine. Overall, the total primary energy consumed is 1504 MJ/kg-H2, giving a WTT efficiency of 8%. Although natural gas consumption (35% of total process fuels) is lower in the Bayer Ketazine pathway than in the PCUK pathway, the consumption of electricity is significantly higher, 65% versus 10% of the total energy consumed. Several factors contribute to the low WTT efficiency when hydrazine is used to regenerate AB. First and foremost is that one third of the hydrogen in ammonia is lost via the formation of water in the reactions to produce hydrazine. The loss of hydrogen effectively reduces the overall process efficiency by one third. Secondly, the Bayer Ketazine process requires sodium hydroxide and chlorine as feeds, while the PCUK process requires hydrogen peroxide as feed, in addition to ammonia. Production of sodium hydroxide and chlorine is energy intensive because of the large amount of electricity used to power the electrolyzers. Production of sodium hydroxide is also energy intensive due to the large amount of steam required in the process. A third hydrazine production process can potentially overcome the need for feeds other than ammonia. This is known as the Benzophenone process that has been demonstrated in the laboratory and thoroughly reviewed [24,25]. However, it has not yet been commercialized. All reagents and catalysts are recycled in a closed loop. We constructed a flowsheet (Fig. 9 ) for this process using the available information in the literature. A mixture of ammonia and air (NH3:O2 = 4:1) is passed through benzophenone under pressure (∼1–8 atm) in the presence of zinc chloride and cuprous chloride catalysts at 200 °C. The reaction produces benzophenone azine; the reaction mixture is diluted with ethanol to precipitate azine and the catalysts. Unreacted benzophenone and some of the catalysts remain in the ethanol solution, from which the ethanol is subsequently distilled off to return the unreacted benzophenone and catalysts to the reaction step. The precipitated catalysts are recovered by washing with benzene to dissolve the azine. The solution is distilled to remove benzene, and the azine is hydrolyzed in the presence of a strong acid, such as sulfuric acid, to yield hydrazine and benzophenone, which is recycled. The reactions are as follow. 2Ph2CO + 2NH3 → 2Ph2CNH + 2H2O 2Ph2CNH + ½ O2 → Ph2CNNCPh2 + H2O Ph2CNNCPh2 + 3H2O → 2Ph2CO + N2H4·H2O The net reaction is 2NH3 + ½ O2 + H2O → N2H4.H2O + H2O We analyzed the AB regeneration process using hydrazine produced via the benzophenone pathway. Results of the analysis showed a well-to-tank (WTT) efficiency of ∼18%, a notable increase over the ∼8% and ∼12% WTT efficiencies of the Bayer Ketazine and the PCUK pathways, respectively."
6,Greenhouse gas emissions,"The database and emission factors in GREET were used to calculate the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the chemical process and the process fuels consumed in every step of each of the flowsheets discussed above. Table 4 compares the greenhouse gas emissions for the three regeneration schemes. In addition to the emissions of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gases (primarily carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide), the projected emissions of five criteria pollutants (volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and particulate smaller than 10 μm aerodynamic diameter) are also included in Table 4. These calculated amounts include emissions from the conversion of feedstocks to process fuels (natural gas, diesel fuel, and electricity), and consumption of process fuels in every step of the life cycle. The estimated GHG emissions for the first thiol-based regeneration scheme are about 27 kg CO2 equivalents per kg hydrogen delivered to the vehicle. The estimated GHG emissions for the second alcohol-based regeneration scheme are ∼20 kg CO2 (eq)/kg-H2 if the BH bond is preserved, which increase to ∼27 kg CO2 (eq)/kg-H2 if the residual H2 is recovered from the spent fuel. Finally, the total GHG emissions for the hydrazine scheme are estimated to be 42, 63 and 101 kg CO2-(eq)/kg-H2 for the Benzophenone, PCUK, and Bayer Ketazine pathways, respectively."
7,Summary and conclusions,"We have constructed flowsheets for three ammonia borane regeneration schemes and analyzed the processes for energy consumption, efficiency, and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions. The three schemes differ in the way the spent fuel is digested, and they are in various stages of development and verification. Our analysis has shown that, in the first, thiol-based, regeneration scheme, formic acid reformation is the most energy intensive step, accounting for >40% of the total primary energy used in the complete fuel cycle. The calculated WTT efficiency is ∼24%, which improves to 28% with heat integration. The estimated greenhouse gas emissions are ∼27 kg CO2 (eq)/kg hydrogen delivered to the vehicle. In the second, alcohol-based, regeneration scheme, the calculated WTT efficiency can be as high as 37% and the greenhouse gas emissions are ∼20 kg CO2 (eq)/kg-H2. This result, however, excluded the energy needed for one or many separation steps that have not yet been formulated. The third, hydrazine-based, regeneration scheme is direct and simple, and it has been successfully verified experimentally with very high yields. The WTT efficiency is low, however; it varies between 8 and 18%, depending on how the needed hydrazine is produced. The corresponding GHG emissions are in the range of ∼40–100 kg CO2 (eq)/kg-H2. In summary, none of the regeneration schemes developed to-date comes close to meeting the 60% DOE target for WTT efficiency. Development of an energy efficient regeneration scheme remains a major challenge for AB to be a viable chemical hydrogen storage material for automotive use."
