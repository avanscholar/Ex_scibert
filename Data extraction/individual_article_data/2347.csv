0,Introduction,"Realization on the global issues like pollutions and other economic aspects, many researchers have taken an enterprise to resolve the circumstances of sustainable society for the imminent decade. Fossil fuels which are inordinately influenced in the energy sector for both the internal and external combustion engines are mitigating as the year past. So, recapitulation on the natural resources, biodiesel admires the auxiliary energy to vanquish the crude oils, as it has identical properties as conventional diesel. Neem plant which are mainly used for the medicinal purposes are also prominent for the general production of neem methyl ester. Neem oil is a non-edible feedstock and also cheaper as compare to other biodiesels [33]. Neem plant has the high efficiency of productivity as its seed contains 20–30% of oil and lived for 180 to 200 years of life span [44]. Neem methyl ester has the predominant characteristic in reduction of emission like CO2, HC, CO as compared to other biodiesels and diesel [50]. Rice wine alcohol which are famous in most of the Asian nations like, China, India, Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, and Japan are prepared by the process of fermentation, filtration and sterilization at the temperature of 85 °C [25]. Temperature is one of the major factor for the fermentation and yield of alcohol [19]. Prasad [35] stated that any organic compound that can be transformed into sugars are easily usable as a substrate for fermentation of alcohol. Rice wine alcohol have an opportunity to use as an additive with biodiesel that has less viscosity and flash point. Also, no emulsification is formed during blending of fuels that help proper atomisation during the combustion. Ragit et al. [37] standardized the transesterification process to reduce the viscosity as the conventional fuel to 2.7cst/s, alcohol to oil molar ratio at 6:1, 55 °C temperature, 60 min of time with the production yield of 83.36% using 2% potassium hydroxide (KOH) as a catalyst. Balamurugan and Nalini [9] blended diesel with n-propanol and n-butanol at 4% and 8% respectively by volume and found increased in brake thermal efficiency by 8.917%, 10.518% at 80% load. But on the other hand, smoke density was found to be increased by 11.338%, 14.063% whereas NOx was seen to be decreased by 11.585%, 14.329%. Dhar et al. [16] studied the production of biodiesel by two-step esterification process obtaining the optimum condition of molar ratio 6:1, temperature 45 °C, 4.5% of catalyst, stirring at 1300 rpm. They observed that the fuel properties lies under the ASTM specifications. Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) were found to be higher with increase in biodiesel percentage. Whereas, the brake specific carbon monoxide, brake specific hydrocarbon were decreased by the blend of biodiesel but brake specific nitrogen oxide increased a bit comparison to pure diesel. Datta and Mandal [12] conducted experimental work in CI engine utilizing biodiesel-alcohol blend (methanol and ethanol) and they confirmed that BTE and BSFC were effectively increased with the addition of alcohols in biodiesel. The cylinder temperature decreases with addition of ethanol or methanol. NOx emission decreased by 30% at 15% ethanol blend, CO2 emission seems to be no significant change with diesel. Whereas, smoke and particulate matter raised significantly by addition of ethanol, methanol with biodiesel. Raman [39] investigated that the use of biodiesel blend remedies unburnt hydrocarbon as biodiesel is rich in oxygenation. Dhamodaran [15] experimentally investigated on three different biodiesel namely, rice bran methyl ester, neem methyl ester, cotton seed methyl ester with neat diesel and found that neem methyl ester gives the highest brake thermal efficiency of 31.08% among other biodiesels. In emissions HC, CO are found to be lowest for rice bran methyl ester as it has the highest oxygen content. But NOx emission is found to be highest for rice bran methyl ester as it has higher cylinder pressure and heat release rate of 72.2 bar and 70.854 J/CA respectively. Alagu and Sundaram [2] studied the pyrolysis of neem seed and investigated the performance, emission in CI engine. They concluded that brake thermal efficiency increased by 3.7% using a blend of biodiesel as compared to pure diesel and BSFC is observed to be higher up to 23.9%. In the emissions HC, CO, CO2 and NOx were found to be reduced by 46.9%, 42.2%, 29.8% and 20.7%. Nair et al. [31] analysed the performance and emission of single cylinder CI engine using neem biodiesel with diesel at different blends (B10, B20, B30). They conclude that B10 shows to be the more significant blend among all the blends that have achieved the lower emissions of CO, HC and NOx by 23%, 8.5% and 22% respectively as a comparison to petroleum diesel. Balaji and Cheralathan (2015a) investigated the neem methyl ester with various properties of antioxidant (A-tocopherol acetate) to lower the NOx emission and they reduced up to 25.95% of NOx emission by adding of 0.01% of antioxidant but emissions like HC, CO, smoke intensity tends to increase. Shrigiri et al. [43] studied the combustion of single cylinder CI engine using cottonseed neem kernel methyl ester and demonstrated that the in-cylinder pressure of semi adiabatic engine was found to be similar with conventional diesel. Musthafa [29] experimentally investigated that the use of cetane improver (1% of di-tert-butyl peroxide) improves the brake thermal efficiency by 2% higher than diesel, brake specific energy consumption (BSEC) was also reduced by 10% lower than conventional diesel. Whereas, in the emission CO, NOx, exhaust gas temperature (EGT) were slightly decreased but a significant rise of HC was found. In the combustion, the peak pressure was seen to be decreasing by the addition of the cetane improver. Sivalakshmi and Balusamy [45] blended neem oil with alcohol like Ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, 1-pentanol and found brake thermal efficiency increases with all alcohol blends and emissions like CO, HC and NOx were slightly degraded that shows alcohol has an important role in CI engine. Yanfeng [51] improved the brake thermal efficiency by 2% using 2-methoxyethyl acetate compared to petroleum diesel and lower the emissions like HC, CO, smoke density by 18.2%, 30.8%, and 50% respectively. Qi [36] blended biodiesel with diesel at 50% equally by volume as base fuel and found a bit late ignition delay at lower load by adding 5% of methanol. At higher load the ignition delay was found to be identical to conventional diesel, whereas the peak cylinder pressure and heat release rate were found to be higher than base fuel. Yilmaz and Sanchez [52] studied the blend of biodiesel with methanol and ethanol, they conclude that ethanol blend with biodiesel was more efficient than a methanol blend biodiesel with respect to emission. Sivalakshmi and Balusamy [46] experimented neem methyl ester with the addition of ethanol and found that the ignition delay, cylinder pressure, heat release rate increases as the ethanol proportion was increased. Bayraktar [11] studied the blend using diesel methanol blend along with 1% dodecanol fixed as a solvent to improve the miscibility, the methanol blends up to 7% was found to be suitable in CI engine without no modification of the engine. Gopinath and Sundaram [18] blend neem methyl ester at 20%, 30% with diesel and compared the performance and emissions with pure diesel. They found that the brake thermal efficiency of B20, B30 and pure diesel are 28.32%, 27.69%, and 26.75% respectively. While in the emissions at the highest load HC, CO was decreased but NOx is found to be higher by the use of B20. Kumar [24] tested the CI engine using 30% by volume of iso-butanol, n-pentanol, n-hexanol and n-octanol. They conclude that higher order of alcohol decreases HC emissions but increased the smoke opacity. In conventional combustion process e-diesel has much lower particulate matter as compared to petroleum fuel [49]. Mohan and Senthil (2017) reviewed that high oxygenated fuel like methyl ester, ethanol, diethyl ether etc. have a great influence in reduction of particulate matter. Abrupt increase of diesel fuel demand and its cost make alternative fuel research more sensitive. From the past review, it is seen that some of the researchers have studied about rice bran oil but not a single work has been investigated yet on rice wine alcohol along with neem methyl ester and conventional diesel. Here the rice wine alcohol shows one of the best recycling of waste cooked rice which is wasted in vast quantity during any functional programme in the nation. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the performance, combustion and emission of existing CI engine using neem methyl ester blend with diesel along with rice wine alcohol as an additive."
1,"Production and yield of rice wine alcohol, analyse of ethanol and transesterification of neem methyl ester",
2,Production and yield of rice wine alcohol,"2.1 Production and yield of rice wine alcohol First, the waste cooked rice is collected, mixed with yeast then stored in the closed container for three days, then after water is poured into it and kept for three more days again for the process of fermentation (metabolic process) for the production of ethanol. It is the process of extracting energy from carbohydrate which is present in the rice in the absence of oxygen, then this fermented rice is heated at moderate temperature as shown in the Fig. 1 in which the wine evaporates in the form of steam (gaseous state) through the pipe due to heat source from burner, then this steam is condensed by water cool heat condenser, where the wine steam is converted to liquid state as given in Fig. 1 this liquid is finally collected in the glass bottles which is known as rice wine alcohol. The optimised value of production and yield is shown in Table 1 ."
3,Analyse of rice wine alcohol (ethanol composition),"2.2 Analyse of rice wine alcohol (ethanol composition) The composition of ethanol in rice wine alcohol is analysed by the rota evaporator (Equitron roteva) shown in Table 2 . Here, the collected rice wine alcohol is treated in the rota evaporator for the extraction of water presence in the rice wine alcohol to improve the concentration of ethanol above 98% that will help in the engine performance for preventing the engine corrosion problem, using as an additive with neem methyl ester-diesel blend, as most of the researchers have worked on ethanol/methanol blend with biodiesel."
4,Transesterification of neem methyl ester,"2.3 Transesterification of neem methyl ester Transesterification is the process for the reduction of the viscosity of raw vegetables oil [7,8,23]. While converting to an ester (biodiesel) using 3 mol of methanol along with the KOH as a catalyst as shown in Fig. 2 . First of all, considering the molar ratio at 6:1 methanol to oil ratio, 1000 g of raw neem seed oil is heated on a magnetic stirrer at a temperature of 60 °C, a complete mixture of 222 g of methanol with 2% by weight of KOH is pour into the oil and heated for 60 min, maintaining the temperature of the whole mixture (neem seed oil + methanol + KOH) at 60 °C-65 °C, then this whole mixture is kept in the dark place for 24 h for the separation of methyl ester (biodiesel) from glycerol as by-product [48,22,5,41,26,1,3]. This methyl ester is then washed with hot water for two times to remove some of the unreactant elements in the biodiesel and then heated again to evaporate the water present in the biodiesel. In this systematic way, the neem methyl ester and rice wine alcohol are prepared, and their physical properties and free fatty acid composition are tested in the chemical lab and explore in Table 3 and Table 4 ."
5,Experimental set up and methodology,"The experiment has been done on a VCR single cylinder CI engine, at the maximum speed of 1500 rpm. At first the engine which is coupled to dynamometer is run at initial load for 10–15 min with conventional diesel to warm up and stable the engine, then five–gas analyzer is interfaced for the test, the smoke meter is kept ready for the analysis of the smoke opacity connected to external power supply, while the computer is connected to control panel board as in Fig. 3 for the automatic acquisition of data using a software i.e. engine soft. Secondly, the blended fuels is prepared as per the strategy i.e. D90B5RW5 (90% diesel + 5% biodiesel + 5% Rice wine alcohol), D85B10RW5 (85% diesel + 10% biodiesel + 5% Rice wine alcohol), D75B20RW5 (75% diesel + 20% biodiesel + 5% Rice wine alcohol) and D65B30RW5 (65% diesel + 30% biodiesel + 5% Rice wine alcohol) [4]. While the specifications of engine, smoke meter and blended fuel properties are exposed in Table 5 , Table 6 and Table 7 . After all the set-up is ready the blended fuels are introduced in the fuel tank one after another. The experiment is performed by the varying the engine load as shown in Fig. 3 and the computer-generated data are calibrated, while the emissions of the engine are noted in the five-gas analyzer. The fuel tank is clean thoroughly after taking the reading of the blend because the fuel remaining in the tank may be mixed with the next blend that affects the properties of the fuel. In this systematic way, the experimental is conducted and data are calibrated, analysed, explained and presented in the respected graphs and figures in the result and discussions."
6,Uncertainty analysis,"The uncertainty analysis is carried out for the process of obtaining the accurate reading of experimental data, as some uncertainties occur during the duration of the number of repetitive experiments. In suitability to the experimental work, the root means square is being familiarized where ‘U’ infers to the total uncertainty of ‘Q’ quantity has been accounted. Grounded on the independent variables x1, x2… xn (i.e., Q = f [x1, x2, …., xn]) having distinct errors of Δx1, Δx2, ….…, Δxn has specified by Eq. (1) [34]. The share of the uncertainty of the performance constraints is exhibited in Table. 8 . (1) Δ U = ∂ U ∂ X 1 Δ X 1 2 + ∂ U ∂ X 2 Δ X 2 2 + . . . ⋯ + ∂ U ∂ X n Δ X n 2 The emissions of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxide, and oxygen are restrained by a 5 Gas analyzer (Make: AVL India, Model:444) static with DiGas. The expanse of secretions is accounted in volume percentage for CO, CO2, O2, and while NOx, HC are restrained in parts per million percentage. The uncertainty investigation arose in the secretions are demonstrated in Table. 9 ."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Performance characteristics,"5.1 Performance characteristics 5.1.1 Brake thermal efficiency Fig. 4 represents the variation of brake thermal efficiency with different blends at various load. The brake thermal efficiency at lower load shows to be similar to all the biodiesel blends as compared to conventional diesel, and as the load is increased to maximum all the blends are found to be rising at different increment of efficiency in which D75B20RW5 shows to be the highest brake thermal efficiency of 8% higher than conventional diesel, while the other blend D90B5RW5, D85B10RW5 has 6.47%, 3.23% higher efficiency. Among all the blends D65B30RW5 shows the lowest brake thermal efficiency of 3.22% comparison to pure diesel this might be due to the lower net heating value and high viscosity of fuel that caused poor miscibility [28,30,42]. Here in Fig. 4. Most of the biodiesel blends with 5% rice wine alcohol accelerates the efficiency as compared to diesel this is might be due to the high oxygenated, low flash point and lower viscosity of rice wine alcohol. 5.1.2 Brake specific fuel consumption Illustration of brake specific fuel consumption with different blends at various load is portrayed in Fig. 5 . Brake specific fuel consumption is the amount of fuel mass consumed in the combustion to produce one unit of power. At 20% engine load the blend fuel seem to have higher BSFC and as the load is gradually increased the blend fuel tend to decrease including conventional diesel [4]. This result because at lower load the temperature and pressure of the combustion chamber do not fully achieve its latent heat, so some of the fresh fuel escaped unburnt through the exhaust valve that let fuel injector to injects more fuel in the combustion of the engine to obtained one unit of brake power. But at the higher load, it is vice versa to lower load that effects better combustion and fresh fuel are completely combust before escaping through the exhaust valve [16,40,14]. At full load D75B20RW5 shows lowest BSFC which is 3.33% lower than diesel whereas other blends D90B5RW, D85B20RW5 and D65B30RW5 has higher BSFC than diesel by 4%, 8% and 16%. Here, in Fig. 5 the addition of 5% additive shows higher BSFC compare to conventional diesel this is due to very low net heating value [31,47] as in Table 1."
9,Emission characteristics,"5.2 Emission characteristics 5.2.1 Carbon dioxide emission Fig. 6 demonstrate the variation of carbon dioxide with disparate blends at different load. Carbon dioxide is mainly formed due to the excess of free carbon radical reacts with unburnt oxygen in the combustion chamber. At initial load, diesel shows the highest carbon dioxide emission followed by D65B30RW5, D85B10RW5, D90B5RW5 and D75B20RW5, frequently as the load is increased all the blend fuels tends to increase gradually as shown in Fig. 6. In most cases, used of biodiesel blend increase carbon dioxide emission as compare to conventional diesel. But here it is observed that biodiesel blend with diesel along with additive degrades the carbon dioxide emission this might be due to OH radical present in the additive [7,40]. That helps the flame propagation for better combustion. Here diesel shows higher carbon dioxide emission throughout the load as it has higher mass percentages of carbon element than any other biodiesel blends [7,6,4,38]. At full load D75B20RW5 shows lowest carbon dioxide emission 5.66% lower than conventional diesel followed by D90B5RW5, D85B10RW5 and D65B30RW5 2.83%, 2.45%, and 1.88%. This explained that 5% additive with biodiesel blend has a priority to reduce carbon dioxide emission than diesel. 5.2.2 Unburnt hydrocarbon emission The effect of unburnt hydrocarbon under the influence of different blends at various load is depicted in Fig. 7 . Hydrocarbon emission is formed mainly due to the incomplete combustion of the engine, the factors that affect the hydrocarbon are ignition delay, poor atomisation, higher viscosity, insufficient in-cylinder temperature and pressure. At 20% engine load D65B30RW5 shows to be the highest hydrocarbon emission followed by conventional diesel, D85B20RW5, D90B5RW5, and D75B20RW5. Here in Fig. 5. Diesel results the continue rise in the emission of hydrocarbon as the load is increased. But whereas other biodiesel blends reflects to fall at 80% load and then rise adversely at full load, this might be due to the higher oxygen content in the blends [48,32,21,14] i.e. additive which achieve the stoichiometric ratio at that particular load, which results complete combustion of fuel [16,15,10]. But at full load D65B30RW5 shows the highest hydrocarbon emission of 5.4% higher than conventional diesel and D75B20RW5 shows the lowest hydrocarbon emission 10.81% lower, which implies complete combustion. 5.2.3 Carbon monoxide emission Fig. 8 display the variation of carbon monoxide emission with different blends at different load. Carbon mono oxide is somehow like hydrocarbon emission which is caused due to lack of oxidation and incomplete combustion, lower flame temperature and high air–fuel ratio, encourage the emission of carbon monoxide in the engine. Here, all the fuels vary synchronically as the load is varied and it is seen that at medium load, carbon monoxide emission tends to fall, this might be due to perfect stoichiometric ratio obtained at that particular load, and at full load, D65B30RW5 shows to be the highest carbon monoxide emission 8% higher than diesel this reflects of higher viscosity and lower miscibility [48,21]. D75B20RW5 results the lowest carbon monoxide emission of 10.8% lower than diesel fuel, this explained the complete combustion [47,14,10] of the fuel which proved in the Fig. 4, which has the highest brake thermal efficiency and lowest BSFC compare to other test fuels. 5.2.4 Nitrogen oxide emission Variation of nitrogen oxide with different blends at different load is shown in Fig. 9 . The oxide of nitrogen emission is seen to be identical at 20% load for all the fuels. The emission of nitrogen oxide increase throughout the load, this is due to the more amount of fuel is injected at the higher load that increased the combustion temperature and pressure [16,15,46,7,4,21,10]. In normal case, nitrogen does not react with oxygen easily but the rise in temperature and pressure of the cylinder force the nitrogen to react with oxygen to form nitrogen oxide. At full load, the biodiesel blends D75B20RW5, D90B5RW5, D85B10RW5 shows 6.4%, 4.26%, 2.13% higher nitrogen emission than diesel, this concludes that biodiesel blends have higher oxygen mass percentage [48,20,40,38]. But D65B30RW5 shows the lowest emission though it has highest biodiesel blend of 30%, this might be due to lower net heating value and higher viscosity that results in low temperature and pressure in the combustion chamber. 5.2.5 Smoke opacity emission Fig. 10 shows the discrepancy of smoke opacity with disparate blends at different load. At initial load similar smoke opacity seen to all the fuel blends and as the load is increased the smoke opacity increase gradually, this is because at higher load more fuel is consumed in the combustion chamber that leads the rise of hydrocarbon emissions which increased the smoke density, due to insufficient of oxygen from atmosphere at rich air–fuel mixture [47]. The biodiesel blends have better efficiency in reduction of smoke opacity than conventional fuel due to extra oxidation reaction in the combustion chamber [4,40]. But D65B30RW5 shows highest smoke opacity than other fuels as because it has high density, high viscosity [32,28] and lower cetane number that caused shorter combustion duration due to poor atomisation of the fuel [46]. At maximum load biodiesel blends D75B20RW5, D90B5RW5, D85B10RW5 shows 22.15%, 13.17%, 6.58% lower smoke opacity than diesel."
10,Combustion characteristics,"5.3 Combustion characteristics 5.3.1 In-cylinder pressure The variation of pressure rise depends on the fuel properties and amount of fuel injected in the combustion chamber. In the Fig. 11(a) similarity trend is seen for all the fuels tested. But a slight variation is noticed at the phase of the start of combustion and peak pressure, this might be due to differences in viscosity and flash point [40]. The maximum pressure obtained for all the test fuels at 20% load is D75B20RW5, which have 49.364 bar at 368-degree crank angle followed by D90B5RW5 48.45 bar at a 368-degree crank angle, D100 48.25 bar at a 368-degree crank angle, D85B20RW5 47.65 bar at a 367-degree crank angle and D65B30RW5 46.95 bar at a 367-degree crank angle. This explains that biodiesel blends enhance cylinder pressure due to rich content of oxygen [48] compare to diesel as in the Fig. 11(b) . At medium load a bit variation of pressure rise, at the initial start of combustion for conventional diesel is visible as compared to biodiesel blends this might be due to differ in cetane number as shown in Fig. 11(a), here the peak pressure of D100 drops a bit compared to D85B10RW5 as relate with 20% load, this can be due to the stoichiometric ratio of the 10% biodiesel blend obtained at that load. But at full load, the variation of pressure at initial stage of combustion for diesel diminishes as compare to medium load which is shown in Fig. 11(c) . This is due to the hike of temperature and pressure in the combustion cylinder [15,46] at full load, which helps the fuel to evaporate faster and auto-ignites at an instant [16,28], at this load all the tested fuels show a similar trend in the hike of peak pressure. D75B20RW5 has the highest peak pressure of 59.3 bar at 368-degree crank angle followed by D90B5RW5, D85B20RW5, D100 and D65B30RW5 of 58.89 bar, 58.20 bar, 57.69 bar and 57.36 bar. Overall the maximum pressure and their location is plot in Table 10 . 5.3.2 Net heat release rate The net heat releases rate increases as the load increased because more fuel is injected at the higher load where more heat energy is produced after the combustion of the mass of the fuel. At 20% load D75B20RW5 shows highest net release rate 38.86 (J/deg) at 365-degree crank angle, followed by D90B5RW5, D100, D85B10RW5 and D65B30RW5 net heat release rate of 37.22 (J/deg), 34.99 (J/deg), 34.08 (J/deg), and 31.40 (J/deg) in Fig. 12(a) . The net heat release rate may also cause due to longer ignition delay in which fuel is combust after the late fraction of time where the amount of fuel is burnt at a time, this exerts the heat release rate. At medium load, the peak pressure of diesel falls a bit lower than D85B10RW5 as shown in Fig. 12(b) this is due to higher oxygenated [15] present in the rice wine that raises the flame propagation at higher load compare to initial load in the biodiesel blend. At full load in Fig. 12(c) D75B20RW5 shows highest net release rate 54.63 (J/deg) at 365° crank angle, which has also achieved the highest brake thermal efficiency as in Fig. 4, followed by D90B5RW5, D85B10RW5, D100 and D65B30RW5 net heat release rate of 52.22 (J/deg), 49.38 (J/deg), 47.75 (J/deg), and 45.40 (J/deg). While D65B30RW5 has the lowest net release rate as in Figs. 12(a)–(c) this may be due to premixed of the fuel [16,46,28] and highly viscous in nature compared to other blends [48] that fails to produce less net heat release rate i.e. Poor combustion."
11,Conclusion,"The findings of the experiment are summarized as follows: • The use of 5% rice wine alcohol lowered the viscosity and flash point of the test fuels that improves the atomisation. • Blends of neem methyl ester and rice wine alcohol with diesel increased the oxygen percentage and decrease the sulphur percentage of the fuels properties which is highly efficient in the performance and emissions role. • D75B20RW5 shows 8% higher brake thermal efficiency and 3.33% lower brake specific fuel consumption compared to diesel. • In the combustion, the peak pressure of cylinder and net heat release rate are seen to be highest for D75B20RW5 i.e. 59.3 bar and 54.63(J/deg). • While in the emissions, smoke opacity, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon are found to be decreased but nitrogen oxide is seen to be higher for all the biodiesel blends. • Overall D75B20RW5 shows a valuable fuel that can be run in the existing CI engine without any modification of the engine."
