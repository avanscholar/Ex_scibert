0,Introduction,"The search for green energy has become hot topic because of increasing energy crisis and environmental pollution [1]. Hydrogen is considered to be a promising and environment-friendly energy with zero-carbon emission and high energy density. In technologies of hydrogen production, the technology by semiconductor-based photocatalytic water reduction for hydrogen evolution has attracted much attention. Since some researchers concerned photocatalytic water reduction for hydrogen production, the low-cost and high-yield nanostructured photocatalysts have attracted considerable interest [2–7]. Among those reports about photocatalysts, metal oxides have attracted great attention due to their high theoretical specific capacity, and narrow band gaps [8]. Cu2O has great advantages due to its low toxicity and favorable conduction/valence band energies [9]. However, the application of Cu2O is limited because of its easy corrosion and lower activity. Many efforts have been focused on solving the problems, including construction of hybrid composite structures [10], coupling with wide band-gap semiconductor [11] and morphology control [12]. Cu2O with octahedral, cubic, spherical, multishelled spherical, and nanocage shapes have been prepared [13,14]. It is shown that the controlled syntheses of cubic and octahedral structures are vital because many other structural forms of Cu2O crystals could derive from the two shapes [15]. In order to improve light absorption, many research groups have extensively studied on metal oxide based photocatalysts for visible light active materials. It is found that the coupling of metal oxide and dye molecule has an important influence on electron transfer efficiency and rate [16]. As a dye molecule, porphyrins are excellent building blocks because of their unique and multiple molecular structures and high visible light absorption. The porphyrins assembled on solid surfaces are widely employed to inhibit porphyrins aggregation and obtain stably functional materials for energy harvesting, water splitting, pollutant photodegradation, sensing, and photodynamic therapy [17–19]. It is reported that Rh porphyrin on carbon black gives higher conversion of CO than that dissolved in solution [20]. Electron transfer from photo-excited porphyrins to a variety of acceptor moieties has been interested [21]. Although the concept of dye sensitization is not new, examples of photofunctional systems composed of porphyrin with special structure attached to cubic Cu2O are critically lack. In addition, using porphyrin molecules for surface functionalization of metal oxide will provide additional control for surface loading and attachment stability of porphyrins. Among porphyrin molecules containing carboxyl, hydroxyl or sulfonic acid groups, those containing carboxylic groups can be combined strongly onto the metal oxides, and possess higher solar-energy conversion efficiency [22]. Meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)-porphyrin (TCPP) molecules have excellent photostability and heat stability, and its excited state and oxidation state have good renewable ability. Importantly, TCPP molecules easily combine with metal oxides. It is found that, with the CuTCPP sensitized TiO2 nanotubes as the photocatalyst, the photocatalytic activity for degradation of methylene blue is improved due to the enlarged response range and effective separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs [23]. Although many studies concerning the porphyrin-sensitized semiconductors have been carried out, the effect of functional groups located at porphyrins on the assembly and the electron transfer of the cubic Cu2O have not been investigated in detail. In this study, TCPP is chosen as an assembly unit and a sensitizer of the cubic Cu2O. By a facile method, the TCPP/Cu2O composite is prepared. The combination mechanism between TCPP and Cu2O is studied by various means. Moreover, photocatalytic hydrogen production and electron transfer mechanism for the obtained TCPP/Cu2O composite are investigated in detail."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation of Cu2O with cubic structure,"2.1 Preparation of Cu2O with cubic structure All chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Typically, the Cu2O were synthesized as follows: 1.6g of polyethylene glycol (PEG, 10000) and 612mg of CuCl2 . 2H2O were added into 200mL of H2O, respectively, and were stirred until PEG and CuCl2 . 2H2O were dissolved. Then, 1.15g of NaOH was added dropwise into the above solution. After being stirred for 15min, 0.73mL of N2H4 solution was added dropwise into the mixture. When the color of the mixture became from blue to brownish red, the mixture was filtered, washed with distilled water for several times, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60°C for 3h."
3,Preparation of the TCPP/Cu2O composite,"2.2 Preparation of the TCPP/Cu2O composite Typically, 1mg of meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP) (purchased from J&K Scientific Ltd) was dissolved into 1mL of ethanol solution, and refluxed for 1h with continuous stirring. Then, a certain amount of Cu2O was added into the solution. The reaction was monitored by a UV–vis spectrophotometer. When the UV–vis spectra of the mixture did not change any more, the reaction was stopped. Subsequently, the mixture was transferred into a culture dish, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60°C. Substituted TCPP with TPP (5,10,15,20-meso-tetraphenylporphyrin, purchased from J&K Scientific Ltd), TPP/Cu2O composite was obtained by similar procedure."
4,Characterizations,2.3 Characterizations Absorption spectra of all samples were recorded with a UV–3900 spectrophotometer (Japan). Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) were measured using a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer (USA). The morphology of the samples was studied using a JEOL JEM–2100F transmission electron microscope (Japan). The sample was pre-outgassed at 60°C under vacuum. X−ray powder diffraction (XRD) was recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance X–ray diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα irradiation (Germany). Steady state emission was measured by a Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer using the correction function supplied by the manufacturer (Japan).
5,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements The photoelectrochemical performance of the samples was measured by a CHI660E electrochemical system using a three-electrode cell (Shanghai Chenhua Instruments, China). Fluorine–doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses coated with the sample were utilized as working electrodes (FTO were cleaned by sonication in ethanol, acetone, chloroform and double distilled water for 15min, respectively, and then dried in the atmosphere), which were prepared via impregnation and subsequent calcination. In brief, 1mg of the sample was mixed with 5mL of alcohol, and the obtained mixture was sonicated for 30s. After that, the FTO glass (1×1.5cm2) was soaked into the mixture for 5min, and then was blow-dried. Repeated that for five times, and then heat-treated at 60°C for 1h. An Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode, and a platinum wire as the counter electrode. A 300W Xenon lamp was used as the light source. The distance between lamp and the FTO electrode was 7cm. The electrolyte solution was 0.5molL−1 of Na2SO4 aqueous solution, and the air in the solution was removed by purging N2 for 15min."
6,Measurement of photocatalytic activity,"2.5 Measurement of photocatalytic activity The photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution over the samples was performed through a CEL–SP2 N water splitting system (Zhongjiao Jinyuan Instruments, China). For photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, 10mg of photocatalyst powder was dispersed by a magnetic stirrer in an up-irradiated photocatalytic reactor containing an aqueous solution of triethanolamine (60mL, volume ratio of water to triethanolamine is 5:1). The reaction cell was connected to a gas circulation system, and the hydrogen evolved was analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (NaX zeolite column, high–purity N2 as carrier gas, thermal conductivity detector). The photocatalysts were irradiated with a 300W Xe lamp. The reaction temperature was kept at about 8.5°C by a circulating water jacket. The gas produced was automatically sampled and analyzed by the online gas chromatography. Before the photocatalytic reaction, the reactor was alternatively evacuated by a vacuum pump and flushed by nitrogen for several times to ensure complete removal of oxygen."
7,Results and discussion,"Various spectroscopies are important to understand the interaction at the interface, surface composition and coordination geometry. UV–vis spectroscopy is one of the important means. Generally, porphyrin base consists of two types of characteristic absorption bands, a Soret band at about 410nm and four Q bands in the range of 500–700nm. As shown in Fig. 1 A (a), the TCPP in ethanol solution displays a strong Soret band at 416nm and four weaker Q bands at 513nm, 547nm, 590nm and 645nm, respectively. After adding Cu2O into the TCPP solution and reacting for 6h, the UV–vis spectrum of the solution changes obviously. The Soret band is blue-shifted 3nm, and the numbers of Q bands are reduced to one. It is the characteristic of the symmetry change from D2h to D4h after metal ions incorporate into porphyrin macrocycle [24]. Therefore, it is deduced that some Cu+ on the Cu2O coordinated with TCPP macrocycle. It is reported that the Q bands of CuTCPP was reduced to one and the Soret band was hardly changed in comparison with those of TCPP [25], which shows some difference from that of the TCPP/Cu2O composite reported in this paper. Therefore, it is preliminarily deduced that the four carboxyl groups located at peripheries of TCPP reacted with the hydroxyl groups in the Cu2O, besides the reaction of some TCPP macrocycles and Cu+ in the Cu2O [23]. In order to demonstrate the assembly way between TCPP and Cu2O, a contrast experiment was designed and carried out. Replaced TCPP with TPP (The peripheral substituents are phenyl groups, while the peripheral substituents in the TCPP molecule are phenyl carboxyl groups), as shown in Fig. 1B, the UV–vis spectrum for the TPP/Cu2O is similar to that of TCPP/Cu2O. However, the reaction of TPP and Cu2O is completed in 40min, and the reaction of TCPP and Cu2O is completed in 6h. Obviously, the reaction rate of TPP and Cu2O is faster than that of TCPP and Cu2O. Therefore, it is confirmed that there exists the reaction among hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups when Cu2O is introduced into TCPP, which is carried out first. Subsequently, the reaction of some TCPP macrocycles and Cu+ in the Cu2O is delayed, and it needs longer reaction time (one-ninth the rate obtained for TPP and Cu2O) to complete the reaction of Cu2O and TCPP. The binding mode of TCPP and Cu2O was further confirmed by FTIR (Fig. 2 ). As shown in Fig. 2a, the strong CO band at 1701cm−1, the symmetric COO− band at 1400cm−1, and the OH stretching vibration band at 1240cm−1 [24,26], can be observed. It is indicated that there exists some exposed hydroxyl groups in solid TCPP (J-aggregate). After introducing a certain amount of Cu2O, the two bands at 1701cm−1 and 1400cm−1 are red-shifted, and the band at 1240cm−1 is almost vanish (Fig. 2b and c). It is attributed to hydrogen bond interaction between carboxylic groups at the peripheries of TCPP and hydroxyl groups in the Cu2O, which is also confirmed by the following TEM image of the TCPP/Cu2O (Fig. 4B). Moreover, the stretching vibration band attributed to the NH in the pyrrole ring is located at about 964cm−1 for TCPP, which disappears in the TCPP/Cu2O, and a new band at about 1000cm−1 appears. It is one of the most prominent features of the metalation of porphyrin macrocycle. Compared with the other metal ions [27], in general, copper ions are not facile to completely enter the center of TPP macrocycle, which can be demonstrated from that of TPP/Cu2O (Fig. 2B, the band at about 1004cm−1 corresponding to Cu-N was weak, though the NH stretching vibration band at about 965cm−1 decreased, and reduced Q bands (Fig. 1B(b)) and shorter reaction time were observed). As electron-donating groups, the carboxyl groups at the peripheries of TCPP facilitate Cu+ into the center of the TCPP macrocycle. Moreover, the hydrogen bond interaction between hydroxyl groups in Cu2O and carboxylic groups in TCPP strengthens the coordination interaction between TCPP macrocycle and Cu+. Therefore, for the TCPP/Cu2O, the changement of the bands at about 964cm−1 and 1000cm−1 are greater. Based on the above analysis, it is concluded that some TCPP macrocycles coordinate with Cu+ on the Cu2O [28], and the interaction is stronger than that of TPP and Cu2O. The results of FTIR spectra and UV–vis spectra suggest that TCPP molecules are assembled on the Cu2O through hydrogen bond interaction (between hydroxyl groups in Cu2O and carboxylic groups in TCPP) and coordination interaction (between some TCPP macrocycles and Cu+). According to the spectral results, the assembly of TCPP and Cu2O can be depicted as Scheme 1 . When the Cu2O was added into TCPP solution, TCPP molecules are first orientated to the surface of Cu2O by hydrogen bond between carboxylic groups at peripheries of TCPP and hydroxyl groups on the Cu2O. As the reaction proceeds, the other carboxylic groups in TCPP also react with the hydroxyl groups on the Cu2O. When the distance between TCPP molecule and Cu2O is favorable, the coordination interaction between TCPP macrocycle and Cu+ will take place, which will promote TCPP molecules to flatten on the surface of Cu2O. That is, the Cu2O easily lead to macrocycle deformation and catalyze the metalation reaction of porphyrin macrocycles, which mimics the role of the proteins in the biosynthesis [29]. Compared with that of Cu2O and TCPP, there only exists coordination interaction between the Cu2O and TPP macrocycle. Therefore, the reaction rate of TPP and Cu2O is faster. These results also demonstrate that more than one carboxylic group react with Cu2O by hydrogen bond. Otherwise, if one carboxylic group reacts with Cu2O by hydrogen bond, TCPP macrocycle is difficult to coordinate with Cu2O due to the disadvantageous configuration, and could not observe the metallation of some TCPP macrocycles in UV–vis spectra and FTIR. The XRD patterns of Cu2O and TCPP/Cu2O composite are shown in Fig. 3 . For the Cu2O, six peaks located at about 29.7°, 36.4°, 42.4°, 61.6°, 73.8° and 77.6° are observed, which correspond to (110), (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) crystal planes of cubic phase Cu2O (JCPDS card, No. 78-2076), respectively, and no other peaks are observed. That is, the cubic Cu2O is obtained. As shown in Fig. 3b, similar patterns are observed in the XRD pattern of the TCPP/Cu2O composite, which indicates that the structure of the Cu2O does not change after assembly with a certain amount of TCPP by hydrogen bond interaction and coordination interaction. The influence of TCPP on the morphology of Cu2O is investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Due to the special structure of TCPP molecule, TCPP molecules tend to self-assemble into flake-like structure by hydrogen bond interaction among carboxyl groups located at the peripheries of the TCPP macrocycle [17]. As shown in Fig. 4A, pure Cu2O is with cubic structure, and the dispersion is good. After introducing TCPP, the morphologies of TCPP and Cu2O are hardly changed (Fig. 4B), which is different from the copper(II) meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin in TiO2 nanotube [30]. The peripheral hydrogen bond interaction and the microscopic network structure of the TCPP in the composite is well-reflected by the observed structure. It is indicated that many carboxyl groups located at the peripheries of the TCPP macrocycle link each other by hydrogen bond interaction even if a little amount of TCPP macrocycles coordinate with Cu2O. Interestingly, the surface of Cu2O, especially edges, is wrapped and smooth after introducing TCPP (Fig. 4B), and Cu2O and TCPP is close combination, which hinders the aggregation of TCPP to a certain extent and also facilitates electron transfer between Cu2O and TCPP molecules. It is important factor for the TCPP/Cu2O composite as a catalyst. By comparing Fig. 4C with Fig. 4B, it is found that the morphological difference between TPP/Cu2O composite and TCPP/Cu2O composite is very obvious. It confirms the more than one carboxylic groups react with Cu2O by hydrogen bond besides coordination interaction between Cu2O and TCPP macrocycle. Otherwise, the Cu2O with wrapped and smooth cubic structure could not be observed in the composite (Fig. 4B). The result of TEM coincides with those of UV–vis spectra and FTIR, which further confirms the deduction shown in Scheme 1. The photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution over the samples is evaluated with triethanolamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial agent. The result is shown in Fig. 5 . The activity of hydrogen evolved over the TCPP/Cu2O composite is significantly higher than that of the Cu2O, and also higher than that of the TPP/Cu2O composite. It is demonstrated that the assembly way between porphyrin and Cu2O has an important influence on photocatalytic activity of the Cu2O, besides improving the light absorption of Cu2O. When the content of TCPP is 25%, the activity of hydrogen evolved is the highest. It is deduced that, light absorption is low when the TCPP is less than 25%. When the TCPP is beyond 25%, electron transfer in the composite could be inhibited due to more aggregation among TCPP molecules. In addition, the active sites of Cu2O could also be shielded when the content of the TCPP is beyond an optimum value in the composite. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), fluorescence spectra, UV–vis spectra, electrochemical impedance spectra and photocurrent response of the composite were studied in order to explore the mechanisms of electron transfer and hydrogen evolution. First, the elemental composition of the obtained composite is determined by XPS. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the peaks attributed to Cu2p, O1s, N1s and C1s can be observed, which is consistent with the elemental composition in the TCPP/Cu2O composite. In Fig. 6B, the binding energy attributed to Cu2p3/2 and Cu2p1/2 is located at 934.6eV and 954.6eV, respectively, which is typical characteristic for Cu+ [31]. The result is consistent with XRD result (Fig. 3) and the preparation method (with N2H4 as reduction agent in the preparation of Cu2O). Two satellite peaks corresponding to Cu2+ (one is at around 963eV and the other is at about 937–947eV) are also observed. The Cu2+ detected by XPS could come from the surface oxidation of tiny amounts of Cu2O when the composite was exposed in air with humidity. It is also reasonable that tiny CuO on the surface could be detected by XPS, but not by XRD because XPS is a surface technique and XRD is a bulk characterization technique. Before the photocatalytic reaction was carried out, the reactor was evacuated by a vacuum pump to remove air. The photocatalytic reaction was carried out under N2 atmosphere. Therefore, tiny amounts of Cu2+ on the surface of the Cu2O can be reduced by H2 evolved and should have little effect on the activity of TCPP/Cu2O photocatalyst. In XPS results of the TCPP/Cu2O composite after light irradiation, the elemental composition is changeless (Fig. 6A(b)), while the two satellite peaks are weakened obviously (Fig. 6B(b)), indicating the tiny amounts of Cu2+ have been partially transformed to Cu+ under H2 atmosphere. The fluorescence spectra of TCPP, CuTCPP and TCPP/Cu2O composite are shown in Fig. 7 . Two emission peaks located at 652nm and 721nm are observed for the TCPP. For the CuTCPP, two emission peaks located at 652nm and 716nm are observed. However, the fluorescence of TCPP is quenched greatly after introducing Cu2O. Only one weak peak at 632nm is observed, which could be attributed to the structure distortion of TCPP aggregate after interacting with Cu2O. By comparing fluorescence spectrum for TCPP with the spectra for CuTCPP and TCPP/Cu2O, the weaken fluorescence partially comes from heavy-atom effect of Cu ions coordinating to TCPP, and is mainly attributed to intermolecular electron transfer from TCPP to Cu2O according to the greatly quenched fluorescence and the movement of the peak at 652nm [32]. The result of fluorescence spectra demonstrates that the interaction between Cu2O and TCPP decreases the aggregation among TCPP molecules, and increases the separation efficiency of electron/hole pairs, which is beneficial to improve the photocatalytic activity of the TCPP/Cu2O composite. It is known that the semicircular feature of the Nyquist plots at high frequencies is the defining characteristic of the charge transfer process (where the diameter of the semicircle is equal to the charge transfer resistance [33]). In order to further explore the essential influence of TCPP on the photocatalytic activity of Cu2O, electrochemical impedance spectra of the samples are measured. As can be seen in Fig. 8 , a great difference for the diameter of semicircles can be observed in various samples. The semicircle of the Cu2O becomes smaller after introducing TCPP. It is indicated that the electrochemical impedance of the TCPP/Cu2O composite is obviously lower than that of pure Cu2O. It could attribute to the close contact among TCPP and Cu2O (Fig. 4B), which is favor to improve the electron transfer efficiency of the Cu2O. When the content of TCPP is beyond 25%, the electrochemical impedance of the TCPP/Cu2O composite becomes big. It is attributed to the increased aggregation caused by excess TCPP, which could hinder the electron transfer between TCPP and Cu2O. The result of electrochemical impedance spectra demonstrates that a certain amount of TCPP introduced into Cu2O will facilitate electron transfer of Cu2O. The result supports the fact that the introduction of TCPP has an important influence on photocatalytic activity of the Cu2O, and also demonstrates the nature of influence of TCPP on the photoactivity of the Cu2O. As shown in Fig. 9 A, after introducing TCPP into the Cu2O, the light absorption of the Cu2O is enhanced. Moreover, the light absorption enhances when the amount of TCPP increases. Obviously, the introduction of TCPP can effectively enhance the light response of Cu2O. Further, photocurrent response of various samples is studied in order to demonstrate the influence of TCPP on light absorption and electron transfer of the Cu2O. As shown in Fig. 9B, when the light is turned on, the photocurrents for various samples are enhanced. It is demonstrated that the samples are photosensitive. However, the photocurrent increases obviously in the composites contained TCPP. When the content of the TCPP in the composite is 25%, the photocurrent is maximum, and is 8 times higher than that of Cu2O. However, the photocurrent decreases when the content of the TCPP in the composite is beyond 25%. It is demonstrated that the content of TCPP has a significant influence on electron transfer of Cu2O besides light absorption. That is, it shows positive roles of TCPP for light absorption and electron transfer when the TCPP is not more than 25%. When the TCPP is beyond 25%, electron transfer in the composite could be inhibited due to more aggregation among TCPP molecules. In addition, the active sites of Cu2O could also be shielded when TCPP is beyond an optimum content in the composite. Therefore, the loading amount of TCPP has an optimum value in the composite. The result is consistent with those of electrochemical impedance spectra and photocatalytic hydrogen production. According to the results of XPS, fluorescence spectra, UV–vis spectra, electrochemical impedance spectra and photocurrent response, the mechanism for electron transfer over the TCPP/Cu2O composite is suggested and shown in Scheme 2 . As a dye molecule, TCPP possesses a wide spectrum absorption range and a high molar absorption coefficient, which is a good sensitizer. In addition, the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital for the TCPP is higher than that of the Cu2O (the positions of band gaps [33,34] are labeled in Scheme 2), which is conducive to the photo-induced electron transfer from TCPP to Cu2O [35]. Subsequently, after light irradiation, the photo-excited electrons of TCPP are easily transferred towards Cu2O, which inhibits recombination of photo-generated electron/hole pairs. Then, water molecules obtain the electrons from Cu2O and are reduced. Fig. 10 shows the result of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution over the recycled TCPP/Cu2O composite. In each recycle, the reaction system is evacuated and irradiated for 6h. It can be seen that, after five recycles, the amount of hydrogen evolution over the TCPP/Cu2O composite is hardly changed, suggesting that the composite photocatalyst is stable."
8,Conclusions,"Various TCPP/Cu2O composites were prepared via a facile method. The assembly mechanism between TCPP and Cu2O was investigated. It was found that hydrogen bond interaction and coordination interaction were the main driving forces. When the content of TCPP in the composite was about 25%, the TCPP/Cu2O composite showed the highest activity for photocatalytic hydrogen production. It was concluded that the binding state between porphyrin and Cu2O was an important factor in the dye-sensitized photocatalysts. Mechanisms of the electron transfer and hydrogen evolution were explored by various means. The results showed that the strong interaction among TCPP and Cu2O, the modified morphology due to introduction of TCPP, higher separation efficiency of photo-generated electron/hole, and strong light absorption were main factors for improving the photocatalytic activity of the composite. Therefore, the composite of Cu2O and TCPP is an efficient approach for improving catalytic activity of cheap Cu2O-based photocatalyst. Assembly and electron transfer mechanisms reported in this manuscript will lay a foundation for preparing novel and ideal photocatalysts for H2 evolution in future."
