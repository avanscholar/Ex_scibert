0,Introduction,"There is continuing interest in the development of heterogeneous catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of carboxylic acids to form alcohols as platform chemicals and intermediates in the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals [1]. Hydrogenation of saturated carboxylic acids and fatty acids in the liquid phase to the corresponding alcohols has been reported over Ru, Pt and Re based catalysts predominantly supported on reducible metal oxides such as TiO2 [1–4]. However, to chemoselectively hydrogenate the carbonyl group in an acid containing additional and more reactive functionality presents an additional challenge. Pd-Re/graphite catalysts have shown ability for hydrogenation of a range of acid substrates to either alcohols or alkanes through control of the reaction conditions. Reactions at 130 °C/20 bar H2 formed the corresponding alcohol while reaction at 160 °C/30 bar H2 lead to an alkane product [5]. This catalyst showed high yields of alcohols from aliphatic acids and diols from diacids; however, for unsaturated acids containing aromatic rings or CC bonds (benzoic acid, furoic acids, oleic acid (isolated CC) and 9-decyncarboxylic acid (isolated CC)) reaction of the unsaturated functionality in addition to the acid carbonyl group occurred. Of note is that separation of the aromatic ring from the acid functionality in the substrate, as in phenylacetic acid, provided high selectivity to the aromatic alcohol product. Phenylethanol was formed with a yield of 73 % with no aromatic ring hydrogenation observed. In addition, cinnamic acid showed reaction of the CC and acid carbonyl groups to form phenylpropanol with the aromatic ring left intact. This was attributed to rapid reaction of the CC group to yield phenylpropanoic acid which as for the non-conjugated phenylacetic acid gave only reaction of the carboxylic acid group. Unsaturated carboxylic acid hydrogenation has also been reported over Re/TiO2 at 140 °C/50 bar H2 where acid hydrogenations proceeded without reaction of the aromatic ring for substrates such as phenylpropanoic acid [4,6]. Interestingly, it was found that Re/TiO2 did have an ability to hydrogenate an aromatic ring as was demonstrated with the reaction of propylbenzene to propyl cyclohexane; however, this reaction did not occur when in the presence of an acid or alcohol. This suggests stronger adsorption of acids/alcohols compared to aromatic rings on Re which was also evidenced from DFT calculations on Re(001) and ReOx surfaces which showed relatively weaker adsorption of benzene and stronger adsorption of acetic acid compared to Pd(111) and Rh(111) surfaces where benzene was adsorbed more strongly [4]. For aromatic carboxylic acids, the higher affinity of Re and ReOx surfaces towards adsorption of the acid carboxyl group provides a highly selective reaction for acids such as phenylpropanoic acid. However, of note is that high selectivity towards acid carbonyl hydrogenations for substrates where the acid carbonyl group was conjugated with an aromatic ring, as in benzoic acid, was not observed over PdRe/graphite (not tested for Re/TiO2). Hydrogenation of benzoic acid over PdRe/graphite formed cyclohexylmethanol with a 73 % yield showing the ease of aromatic ring hydrogenation of this substrate compared to phenylacetic acid. The selective hydrogenation of benzoic acid to cyclohexane carboxylic acid has been shown to proceed with excellent selective towards the hydrogenation of the aromatic ring being achieved under very mild reaction conditions [7–12], whilst PdRe/TiO2 (130 °C and 20 bar H2) and Rh/Al2O3 based catalysts (150 °C and 100 bar H2) resulted in complete reduction to the saturated alcohol [5,13] (Scheme 1 ). High selectivity to benzyl alcohol has been achieved homogeneously [14,15] and in the gas phase over Au supported on CeO2 and Ce0.62Zr0.38O2 catalysts at 250−300 °C with the concentration of oxygen vacancies in the supports influencing direct or sequential pathways to benzyl alcohol [16]. The nature of the metal and support influences the activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of benzoic acid [17]; however, to date, there are few studies where both high activity and high selectivity to benzyl alcohol have been reported showing that selective hydrogenation of the benzoic acid to benzyl alcohol is still a challenging reaction over heterogeneous catalysts. The highest selectivity reported, to date, for the liquid phase hydrogenation of benzoic acid was over a Ru based catalyst with the addition of tin as a promoter of selectivity [18]. Tin has also been used as a promoter of selectivity for Ru and Rh based catalysts for the chemoselective hydrogenation of the unsaturated carboxylic acid oleic acid [19,20] and for selective CO hydrogenation in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes [21–23]. For benzoic acid, Ru-Sn/Al2O3, with 5 % Ru with 11.7 % Sn, prepared by sequential impregnation (Sn addition to alumina with calcination before addition of the Ru precursor) with optimal activity found for the catalyst following high temperature calcination (973 K) and reduction (723 K), afforded benzyl alcohol in 94 % yield for reaction at 260 °C and 98 bar H2 (selectivity quoted after 6 h of reaction). The interaction between Pt and Sn has been reported to enhance catalytic activity and selectivity for Pt-Sn based catalysts with metal precursor, catalyst preparation method and reduction temperature all shown to influence the nature and degree of interaction formed between Pt and Sn [24]. Herein, we report the chemoselective hydrogenation of benzoic acid over a Pt/SnO2 catalyst prepared by a standard wet impregnation method. Pt supported on SnO2 catalysts have been shown to improve the selectivity to CO hydrogenation for α,β-unsaturated aldehyde crotonaldehyde where formation of PtSn alloy phases were proposed to be important for activity and selectivity of the catalyst [21]. Increased activity for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation was also observed for PtSn/C catalysts where alloy formation and oxidised tin species were proposed to provide the selectivity enhancement with alloy formation / dilution of the Pt surface proposed to hinder CC bond hydrogenation while oxidised tin species activated the CO group for hydrogenation [22]. In this study we report the selective hydrogenation of benzoic acid to benzyl alcohol over Pt/SnO2 under significantly milder conditions, 190 °C and 30 bar H2, than has been reported, to date, with no ring hydrogenation products observed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Catalyst preparation and characterisation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation and characterisation Both 5 %Pt supported on alumina and tin(IV) oxide catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation. Platinum (IV) nitrate (Alfa Aesar) precursor was added to γ-aluminium oxide (255 m2 g−1, Alfa Aesar) or SnO2 (6.70 m2 g−1, Aldrich) in a methanol solution and the mixture stirred for 12 h. After the solvent was evaporated, the paste was dried in air for 4 h at 120 °C and then calcined in air for 4 h at 500 °C. Pt/C (10 wt% Pt) was purchased from Sigma. The surface area, total pore volume and average pore diameter of the synthesised catalysts were measured by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K using Micromeritics ASAP 2020. The pore size was calculated on the adsorption branch of the isotherms using Barrett–Joyner–Helenda (BJH) method and the surface area was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The composition of these catalysts was determined using a Perkin Elmer Optima 4300 DV Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES). The metals were digested from the oxide supports using nitric acid and hydrochloric acid. The powder X-ray diffraction technique was used for the characteristics of the crystalline structure of catalysts, with a PANalytical X'Pert Pro MPD X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα irradiation. The diffractograms were measured from 20 to 80° (2θ), with a step size of 0.033° (2θ). H2-TPR measurements were carried out using a Quantachrome ChemBet Pulsar TPR/TPD, equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Prior to the TPR measurement, approximately 20 mg of the respective catalysts was loaded into a quartz U-tube plugged with quartz wool. The sample was pre-treated under 10 % O2/He at 350 °C for 60 min at a total flow of 40 cm3 min−1 and the temperature was then decreased to -50 °C, where 5 % H2/Ar was introduced at the same flow rate. The temperature was then increased from −50 to 800 °C at 10 °C min−1. CO chemisorption measurements were carried out using a Quantachrome ChemBet Pulsar TPR/TPD, equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Prior to the adsorption of CO, the Pt/Al2O3 or Pt/SnO2 (30 mg) was reduced at either 200 or 350 °C under 5 %H2/Ar at a total flow of 40 cm3 min−1. After reduction, the system was purged with He and the temperature lowered. The adsorption of CO was performed at −60 °C with the catalysts exposed to pulses of 10 % CO/He repeatedly until no further uptake was observed. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images, scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) images and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum images were obtained with an FEI Talos F200X microscope equipped with an X-FEG electron source and Super-X SDD EDS detectors. The experiment was performed using an acceleration voltage of 200 kV and a beam current of approximately 1 nA. TEM images were recorded with an FEI CETA 4k × 4k CMOS camera. STEM images were acquired with a HAADF detector. Near ambient pressure (NAP) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on a Specs DeviSim NAP system (base pressure 1 × 10−9 mbar). The photoelectrons were excited using a monochromated Al-Kα (1486.6 eV) source which was micro focused to a 300 μm spot with analysis of the photoelectrons carried out using a Specs Phoibos 150 differentially pumped electron analyser operating at 30 eV pass energy. The 5 % Pt/SnO2 powder was mounted to a gold foil substrate support prior to loading into the vacuum environment. NAP-XPS analysis, H2 exposure and temperature treatments were carried out in a highly controlled fashion within the Specs DeviSim NAP cell which was docked onto the first differential aperture of the Phoibos analyser during analysis. XPS spectral fitting and analysis was carried out using Aanalyzer software in conjunction with CasaXPS. Spectra were fitted using Voigt profiles (with the exception of metallic species which were fitted using asymmetrical line shapes) utilising Shirley backgrounds. All spectra were charge corrected to the gold foil substrate signal (Au4f7/2 at 84 eV) with the minor adventitious carbon signal also noted to remain at the accepted value of 284.8 eV throughout the course of the analysis. Reduction of the metal oxide species was carried out by flowing hydrogen into the NAP cell up to a pressure of 1 mbar and subsequently raising the sample temperature from room temperature (∼300 K) to 475 K during hydrogen flow where it was held at this target temperature for 15 min. DRIFT spectra were recorded over the catalyst using a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer with a Spectra Tech Collector II DRIFTS accessory with environmental chamber allowing spectra to be recorded under gas environments and at elevated temperatures [25]. The Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SnO2 catalysts were reduced at reduction temperatures between 100 and 350 °C for 1 h in 10 %H2 in Ar. The gas feed was then switched to Ar to purge the cell before cooling to room temperature for the adsorption of CO (2 % CO in Ar, 50 mL min−1). Spectra were recorded with 128 scans at 4 cm−1 and the background was the fresh catalyst before reduction. ATR-IR spectra were recorded over alumina and Pt/Al2O3 layers slurried onto a ZnSe crystal in water. Spectra were recorded using a PIKE ATRMaxII accessory housed in a Bruker Tensor II spectrometer. All layers were initially heated to 90 °C under a flow of hydrogen saturated dioxane for 30 min before cooling and switching to 0.1 M benzoic acid in dioxane solution. Spectra were recorded with 8 scans at 4 cm−1 resolution and the background was the fresh catalyst layer before introduction of solvent."
3,Hydrogenation reactions,"2.2 Hydrogenation reactions All hydrogenation reactions were performed in a 100 ml Parr batch reactor and the typical reaction conditions were 0.002 mol substrate (benzoic acid or benzene) in 40 ml 1,4-dioxane, 190 °C and 30 bar H2 (30 bar total reaction pressure for reaction at 190 °C with a partial pressure of H2 of 20 bar) over 100 or 200 mg of the respective catalysts with the reaction stirred at 1500 rpm. In addition, reactions at varied H2 partial pressures (5−20 bar) and concentration of benzoic acid (0.001–0.003 mol) were also performed. Before each reaction, the catalyst was pre-reduced in situ for 1 h at 200 °C at 30 bar H2 in dioxane. Additional reactions following a gas phase reduction of the Pt/SnO2 catalyst under a flow of H2 at 200 °C and 400 °C were performed. The flow reduction at 200 °C was performed in the Parr autoclave with no solvent for 1 h after which 40 ml of benzoic acid solution (0.05 M) was syringed into the reactor through the liquid sampling port while still under H2 flow. The reactor was then purged with H2 and the reaction performed (100 mg Pt/SnO2, 30 bar H2 and 190 °C). The reduction at 400 °C for 1 h was carried out in a furnace under a flow of H2. After the reduction, the furnace temperature was lowered and the system purged with N2 before rapid transfer to the autoclave for reaction again performed at 30 bar H2 and 190 °C. Samples were taken from the reactor at different time intervals and analysed by gas chromatography to monitor the compositional change with reaction time and a mass transfer study was performed to ensure that reactions were under intrinsic kinetic control. The gas chromatograph used for composition analysis of the reaction samples was a Perkin Elmer Clarus 500 with a Phenomenex Zebron ZB-WAX capillary column, utilising an FID. Calibration curves for benzoic acid and products benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate and cyclohexylcarboxylic acid were performed to allow quantitative analysis of the reactions with determination of the reaction mass balance. The recycle experiment was performed with 0.002 mol substrate in 40 ml 1,4-dioxane, 30 bar H2 and 190 °C, over 200 mg of the catalyst with the reaction stirred at 1500 rpm. The catalyst was recovered by filtration, washed with dioxane and dried in air. Before each reaction, the recovered catalyst was re-reduced as for the first reaction (200 °C for 1 h under 30 bar H2). In addition, a recycle experiment whereby the catalyst did not undergo reductive regeneration between reactions was performed. The first reaction ran for 4 h before the reaction was stopped and the liquid removed before addition of dioxane and 0.002 mol of benzoic acid and a reaction at 190 °C and 30 bar H2 performed for a second time."
4,DFT calculations,"2.3 DFT calculations DFT calculations were carried out with a periodic slab model using the Vienna ab initio simulation program (VASP) [26–29]. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) [30] exchange-correlation functional. The projector-augmented wave (PAW) method [31,32] was utilized to describe the electron-ion interactions, and the cut-off energy for the plane-wave basis set was 450 eV. Furthermore, to illustrate the long-range dispersion interactions between the adsorbates and catalyst surfaces, we employed the van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) method, which was originally proposed by Dion et al. [33] and further developed by Thonhauser et al. [34], Michaelides et al. [35,36], Román-Pérez et al. [37] and some others. Exchange functional, optB88-vd [36,37], were chosen, which were reported to be reasonably accurate for surface adsorption calculations [38,39]. Brillouin zone integration was accomplished using a 2 × 2×1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh. All the adsorption geometries were optimized using a force-based conjugate gradient algorithm, while transition states (TSs) were located with a constrained minimisation technique [40–42]. Three different surfaces were considered in this work, namely the close-packed platinum surface (Pt(111)), platinum on tin oxide (Pt/SnO2), and platinum on reduced tin oxide (Pt/SnO2-x). For the modelling of Pt(111), a typical surface model with a periodic four-layer p(4 × 4) model with the 2 lower layers fixed and 2 upper layers relaxed were used. For the modelling of platinum on tin oxide, we used a global optimization method, namely the particle swarm optimization (PSO), to obtain the most stable structures of cluster-oxide structures. Comparing to some previous modelling of bi-component systems [43,44], this global optimization algorithm can provide a much more realistic and accurate illustration of cluster and interface structures, which may be of great importance in the selective hydrogenation of benzoic acid. In this work, the PSO were carried out using the CALYPSO code [45–47], which is a power tool to get the stable structures at given external conditions. The unreduced tin oxide was modelled with a six-layer model with 3 upper layers relaxed and 3 lower layers fixed, while the reduced surface was modelled by removing the bridge oxygen of unreduced tin oxide. For both Pt/SnO2 and Pt/SnO2-x, Pt clusters with twelve platinum atoms were chosen, and the structures of cluster and interface were obtained using PSO. Twenty optimization generations were calculated with sixteen surfaces in each generation. Thus, overall 320 structures were examined for both systems, and the most stable surfaces were chosen."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Hydrogenation of benzoic acid,"3.1 Hydrogenation of benzoic acid The hydrogenation of benzoic acid over Pt/SnO2 gave excellent selectivity to benzyl alcohol with selectivity of 97 % at 98 % conversion of benzoic acid (Fig. 1 ). This reaction was performed at 190 °C and 30 bar H2 which are considerably milder reaction conditions for hydrogenation of benzoic acid than have been previously reported [18]. Trace amounts of intermediate hydrogenation product benzaldehyde was also detected (Fig. 1b) with a maximum of 16 % selectivity to benzaldehyde observed only at the very start of the reaction while esterification product benzyl benzoate was only formed in trace amounts <1 % after 24 h of reaction. Under these reaction conditions, Pt/SnO2 was found to be reusable with no significant change in the conversion of benzoic acid or the selectivity to benzyl alcohol observed for three recycle reactions with a reduction at 200 °C, 30 bar H2 for 1 h performed before each recycle reaction (Fig. S1). There was no activity observed when the catalyst was recycled without the reduction step. Interestingly, hydrogenation of the aromatic ring was not observed over Pt/SnO2 under any of the reactions conditions used in this study. In addition, when benzene was used as the substrate, no hydrogenation was observed. Adsorption/reaction of aromatic rings was hindered on Pt when supported on SnO2. The promoting effect of SnO2 as the support was also highlighted by the differing reactivities/selectivities that were observed for Pt supported on carbon and alumina. For a commercial Pt/C catalyst, lower activity compared to Pt/SnO2 was observed with only 24 % conversion after 24 h of reaction. The major product of the reaction over Pt/C was cyclohexane carboxylic acid with selectivities of 81.4 % to cyclohexane carboxylic acid, 14.9 % to benzyl alcohol and 3.7 % to cyclohexylmethanol (Fig. S2). Even lower activity was observed for reaction over a 5 %Pt/Al2O3 catalyst where only 3 % conversion was observed after 24 h of reaction at 190 °C and 30 bar H2 (Fig. S3) and reaction over the SnO2 support alone gave only 2 % conversion in 24 h of reaction likely due to lack of activation of hydrogen without platinum (reaction at 190 °C and 30 bar H2). The activity for acid carbonyl hydrogenation is clearly promoted by an interaction between Pt and SnO2. The acid carbonyl group activation ability of this catalyst was further highlighted by the formation of benzyl alcohol in a reaction performed at only 150 °C and 15 bar H2. However, at these milder conditions, an effect of adsorption was observed with comparable initial rates of removal of the benzoic acid observed for the reactions under H2 and N2. However, the formation of benzyl alcohol was only observed for the reaction under H2 (Fig. S4) and at a lower rate than the removal of benzoic acid indicating that the latter is dominated by adsorption at these milder conditions. Variation of the reaction pressure partial pressures of H2 of 5, 10 and 20 bar (total reaction pressures of 15, 20 and 30 bar) showed an increase in initial rate of production of benzyl alcohol from 0.028 to 0.048 mmol dm−3 min−1 with increasing pressure. The initial rates of reaction were determined from the formation of benzyl alcohol as opposed to the conversion of benzoic acid due to the strong adsorption observed in the initial period of the reaction. The order of reaction with respect to hydrogen was determined from a plot of ln(initial rate) against ln(H2 pressure) and was found to be of fractional order with a value of 0.4 (Fig. 2 ). The initial rate of reaction was also found to vary with the concentration of benzoic acid in the reactor (0.001–0.003 mol) with the rate increasing with concentration. The order of reaction with respect to benzoic acid was found to be 0.8 (Fig. 3 )."
7,Catalyst characterisation,"3.2 Catalyst characterisation Characterisation of the properties of the Pt/SnO2 catalyst (Table S1) was performed and compared to that of Pt/Al2O3 which was inactive for the hydrogenation of benzoic acid. While Pt/SnO2 has a significantly lower surface area than Pt/Al2O3 (9.3 m2 g−1 and 235 m2 g−1 respectively) TEM analysis showed comparable Pt particle sizes of 1−2 nm for both catalysts (Figs. S5 and S6). XRD of the catalysts showed only peaks due to the supports which corroborates the small size of the Pt particles observed by TEM (Fig. S7). This indicates that the surface area and particle size effects/dispersion are not the main influence on the activity of these catalysts and again suggests that an interaction between the metal and the support is important for the activity of Pt/SnO2. TPR of Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SnO2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 . For PtSnO2, the main reduction features occurred between 200−400 °C due to reduction of PtOx strongly interacting with the support and also possibly some partial reduction of SnO2 most likely at the interface with the Pt nanoparticles (Figs. 4 and S8) [48,49]. A small reduction feature at much lower reduction temperatures (below 100 °C) was also observed which could be due to reduction of PtOx weakly interacting with the Pt/SnO2 support. Bulk SnO2 reduction occurred above 500 °C for Pt/SnO2 while for the support alone, bulk reduction of SnO2 occurred above 650 °C (Fig. S8). The reduction of PtOx for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was observed to be complete at temperatures below 300 °C with the main reduction peak occurring at 110 °C, showing the weaker interaction of Pt with the alumina compared to the tin dioxide support. To probe the oxidation state of the Pt and Sn in Pt/SnO2, XPS analysis was performed on the fresh Pt/SnO2 catalyst and after reduction at 200 °C (1 mbar of H2 pressure for 15 min). XP spectra of the Pt4f region for Pt/Al2O3 showed only a single Pt species with Pt4f7/2 peak at 73.4 eV due to Pt(II) species (Fig. S9). For Pt/SnO2, Pt was predominantly in an oxidised state with Pt4f7/2 peaks at 74.7 eV and 72.8 eV due to Pt(IV) and Pt(II) species with a minor contribution due to metallic Pt at 71.2 eV also observed (Fig. 5 ) [50,51] which has also been reported for PtSn/C catalysts. In order to investigate the effect of the reduction procedure on the Pt/SnO2 catalyst, NAP-XPS was employed to simulate the reduction procedure utilising an in-situ approach preventing ambient exposure of the sample prior to analysis which can alter the true chemistry of the reduced surface. Fig. 5 displays the Pt4f regions following the reduction where a dramatic change in peak shape was noted for the Pt4f profile with only metallic Pt observed in the sample surface after reduction. In addition to a change in the Pt4f profile following reduction, a change was also noted in the Sn3d profile as displayed in Fig. 6 . A single doublet within the Sn3d window was noted for the fresh catalyst upon loading, consistent with a SnO2 state (binding energy for Sn3d5/2 of 486.9 eV). Following the reduction, two key features are noted for the Sn3d spectrum. Firstly, a shift to higher binding energy is noted for the oxidised Sn peaks (∼0.3 eV) relative to the as loaded state. This shift in B.E. could be explained as a result of band bending, as seen in previous SnO2 studies via XPS [52]. Secondly, a shoulder feature emerges (binding energy for Sn3d5/2 of 485.6 eV) from the main peak doublet with a separation of 1.4 eV on the lower binding energy side from the main feature, consistent with the shift separation expected between SnO2 and Sn metal. Previous studies of metallic Pt deposited on a SnO2 surface by Körber et al. have shown that metallic platinum can reduce the SnO2 surface to metallic Sn [53] and formation of metallic tin has also been observed for a range of Pt-Sn catalysts with Sn 3d5/2 peaks at 485.6 eV reported to be in the range for metallic tin in an alloy phase [54]. The proportion of metallic tin after reduction was below 10 % highlighting that tin is predominantly in an oxidised state even after reduction at 200 °C. The presence of both metallic tin and metallic platinum could suggest formation of alloy phases which have been reported for Pt/SnO2 and Pt-Sn/metal oxide catalysts. XRD of Pt/SnO2 after reduction at 170/200 °C showed formation of a PtSn phase; [21] however, reduction of a 20 %Pt/SnO2 catalyst at 200 °C did not show formation of intermetallic compounds by XRD [48]. Interestingly both these studies showed higher reduction temperatures (250 and 400 °C respectively) to generate tin rich alloy phases (PtSn2 and PtSn4) with lower activity observed following this high temperature reductive treatment. However, study of crotonaldehdye hydrogenation over pure Pt(111) and model Sn/Pt(111) alloy surfaces showed only an enhancement in the activity for the alloy surfaces compared to the Pt(111) surface with no change in selectivity [55]. This suggests that alloy formation alone cannot account for the enhancements in selectivity for CO hydrogenations with Pt-support interactions as well as Pt-Sn interactions required for control of the activity and selectivity which are likely influenced by catalyst preparation method as well as the temperature of reduction. The activation of CO bonds by ionic (oxidic) tin species has been reported for PtSn catalysts prepared by surface organometallic reactions which have been shown to be active and selective for hydrogenation of furfural to furfural alcohol [56] and cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol [57]. For these catalysts, Pt-Sn alloy phases and ionic tin species were observed on the catalyst with ionic tin proposed to activate the CO bond of the aldehydes to hydrogenation. CO pulse chemisorption and was performed to study the effect of reduction temperature on the CO adsorption capacity of Pt. For Pt/Al2O3 reduced at 200 °C, CO pulse chemisorption gave a dispersion of 55 % which decreased to 16 % following reduction at 350 °C which is likely due to sintering of the Pt particles. For the Pt/SnO2 catalyst, significantly lower adsorption of CO was observed (calculated dispersion was only 0.72 %) following reduction at 200 °C while no CO uptake occurred when reduced at 350 °C. The lower chemisorption ability of Pt when supported on SnO2 compared to Al2O3 is indicative of the interaction between Pt and Sn which could be due to dilution effects from alloy formation and/or migration of SnOx species onto the Pt surface. DRIFT spectroscopy was also utilised to probe the electronic state of Pt in the Pt/SnO2 catalyst. The adsorption of CO at room temperature following reduction at temperatures between 100 and 350 °C was performed over Pt supported on SnO2 and compared to Pt supported on Al2O3 (Fig S10). For Pt/SnO2, in the temperature region where reduction of PtOx and partial reduction of interfacial SnO2 occurs (200−400 °C from TPR), the chemisorption ability of Pt for CO was significantly modified (Fig. 7 ). For reduction below 200 °C, weak PtCO bands were observed with a band at 2086 cm−1 for Tred of 100 °C, 2080 cm−1 for Tred of 150 °C shifting to 2075 cm−1 for Tred of 200 °C. These bands are assigned to CO linearly adsorbed on terrace sites of Pt particles [58]. No bands due to CO adsorption on the support were observed under any conditions used herein. The shifting of the PtCO band from 2086 to 2075 cm−1 could be a result of restructuring of the Pt nanoparticle with more coordinatively unsaturated sites forming or the generation of electron rich Pt sites (increased backbonding into CO antibonding orbitals weakening the CO bond and red-shifting the PtCO band) following reduction at 200 °C [59]. Alternatively, the red shift (2086–2075 cm−1) could be a result of a geometric effect where alloy formation or migration of SnO2/SnO2-x species onto the Pt could block sites for CO adsorption giving a lower coverage of CO and a reduction in dipole-dipole coupling which shifts the band position to lower wavenumbers. Following reduction at 200 °C, the intensity of the linear PtCO band at 2075 cm−1 increased and a new linear PtCO band was observed at 2040 cm−1 suggesting modification of the platinum surface with reduction of the catalyst. Similar spectra were observed for Pt-Sn/TiO2 catalysts with bands at 2072 cm−1 with a shoulder at 2040 cm−1 [60]. A band at 2050 cm−1 has also been observed for Pt-Sn alloyed catalysts [58,60] and assigned to CO adsorbing on Pt sites belonging to a Pt-Sn phase. In the study of Moscu et al. it was highlighted that the PtSn phases could be intermetallic compounds such as PtSn or Pt3Sn or a random alloy and interestingly, they showed that the alloy phases could segregate and be regenerated with variation in the temperature. Under the CO/H2 feed at temperatures above 175 °C, a single band for CO adsorbed on Pt-Sn species was observed between 2054−2045 cm−1 while at lower temperatures (<175 °C) segregation of the Pt-Sn alloy phases occurred with the PtCO band position shifting to 2071 cm−1 indicating adsorption of CO on essentially pure Pt sites. Herein, the formation of the band at 2040 cm−1 between 150−200 °C reduction temperature, could be due to CO adsorption on a Pt-Sn alloy phase which corroborates the study of Liberková and Touroude [21] where Pt-Sn alloy phases were observed to form at 170 °C. The PtCO band at 2075 cm−1 (CO adsorbed on essentially pure Pt sites) continued to shift to lower wavenumbers upon increasing the temperatures until a reduction of 350 °C wherein, PtCO bands were no longer detected. DRIFT spectra of the adsorption of CO on Pt/SnO2 show that both Pt and Pt-Sn sites are present on the surface of the catalyst with reduction of the catalyst above 200 °C resulting in significant perturbation of the chemisorption ability of the catalyst which is likely due to encapsulation of platinum by SnO2/SnO2-x species or formation of tin-rich alloy phases [48,61]. The characterisation of the catalysts highlights that the temperature of reduction for Pt/SnO2 can significantly alter the interaction between Pt and Sn. However, all the techniques used to characterise the catalysts were performed under a flow of H2 (gas phase reduction) which differs from the in-situ reduction in the liquid phase performed in the catalytic activity tests. As the reduction is essential for the state of the catalyst, the hydrogenation of benzoic acid after gas phase flow reductions at 200 °C (performed in the autoclave without solvent) and at 400 °C (ex-situ reduction in a furnace) were also performed. For the flow reduction at 200 °C, the conversion of benzoic acid was slightly lower which could be due to mass transfer limitation of H2 to the catalyst for flow in the Parr reactor (no solvent/mixing) (Fig. S11). Importantly, the same selective formation of benzyl alcohol was observed which suggests that the active state of Pt/SnO2 was comparable following both reductive treatments at 200 °C. For the reduction of Pt/SnO2 at 400 °C, the hydrogenation activity of Pt/SnO2 was significantly reduced with only 3.5 % conversion after 24 h of reaction at 190 °C and 30 bar H2 forming benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde and benzyl benzoate. Fig. S12 shows the %Selectivity vs. %Conversion profile for this reaction where slow conversion of benzaldehyde to benzyl alcohol is observed (%S = 73 %, 16 % and 11 % to benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde and benzyl benzoate after 24 h of reaction). Reduction at 400 °C has significantly impaired the activity of the catalyst compared to the standard 200 °C reduction which is likely related to decreased hydrogen dissociation when Pt is encapsulated by SnOx. The Pt assisted reduction of SnO2 is essential in providing the activity of this catalyst. The formation of an alloy phase/migration of SnOx onto Pt could block sites for hydrogenation of the aromatic ring with oxidised tin species (SnOx) likely at the periphery of the Pt nanoparticle proposed to activate the acid carbonyl group for hydrogenation."
8,DFT calculations,"3.3 DFT calculations To probe whether partially reduced (SnOx) species can activate the CO bond for hydrogenation, DFT calculations of the mode and energy of adsorption of benzoic acid on Pt(111) and Pt supported on tin dioxide were performed. To model the platinum on tin dioxide, a global optimization method was used, namely particle swarm optimization (PSO), to obtain the most stable Pt-SnO2 cluster-oxide structures (Table S2 and Fig. S13). In comparison with previous modelling of bi-component systems [43,44], this global optimization algorithm can provide a much more realistic and accurate illustration of cluster and interface structures, which is required in order to study catalytic systems where the activity is related to support-metal interactions. For each system, the adsorption energy was calculated for benzoic acid adsorption though either the aromatic ring or the acid carbonyl group (Table 1 ). For the Pt(111) surface, π adsorption through the aromatic ring was found to be considerably more favoured than σ adsorption through the acid carbonyl group with adsorption energies of −1.25 and −0.89 eV respectively (Fig. 8 ). The adsorption energy of benzoic acid on Pt/SnO2 showed a comparable trend to that of benzoic acid on Pt(111) with the π interaction favoured with adsorption energies of −1.25 and −0.89 eV for Pt(111), and −2.02 and −1.28 eV for Pt/SnO2 (Figs. 8 and S13). The favoured π mode of adsorption indicates that hydrogenation of the aromatic ring would be the expected pathway over both these surfaces; however, this was not observed experimentally. This suggests that reduction to the metal alone cannot produce an active catalyst therefore reduction of the support was also considered in the modelling of benzoic acid adsorption in this catalytic system. The adsorption of benzoic acid on a reduced Pt/SnO2-x surface was modelled by removing the bridging oxygen from tin dioxide. This partial support reduction resulted in a change in the most stable Pt cluster structure and interestingly, a switch in the favoured mode of adsorption of benzoic acid with the σ adsorption mode now more favourable than the π interaction with binding energies of −0.98 and −0.74 eV, respectively (Figs. 8 and S14). Reduction of the tin dioxide led to a significant weakening of the π mode of adsorption of benzoic acid compared to when adsorbed on the Pt(111) and Pt/SnO2 (unreduced tin dioxide) surfaces. Modelling of benzoic acid adsorption on platinum with a strong interaction with the tin dioxide support resulted in activation of the acid carbonyl group in favour of the aromatic ring and showed that partial reduction of SnO2 could influence the reaction selectivity in line with the activity data and catalyst characterisation results."
9,Hydrogenation of benzoic acid over Pt/Al2O3,"3.4 Hydrogenation of benzoic acid over Pt/Al2O3 DFT calculations on Pt(111) and Pt on SnO2 (without reduction) showed that benzoic acid adsorption occurs through the aromatic ring which has also been reported experimentally for Pt(111) [62]. It is interesting therefore, that no hydrogenation activity was observed over the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst as a degree of activity towards cyclohexane carboxylic acid could be expected as was observed over Pt/C (Fig. S2). To investigate this, in-situ ATR spectroscopy was used to study the adsorption of benzoic acid over Pt/Al2O3. A Pt/Al2O3 layer, pre-reduced under a flow of H2-saturated dioxane at 90 °C was exposed to a 0.1 M benzoic acid in dioxane solution at room temperature (Figs. 9 and S15). In the spectra over both the catalyst (Fig. 9), and the alumina support alone (Fig. S16) adsorption of benzoic acid formed bidentate benzoate species from dissociative adsorption of benzoic acid on alumina. Bands due to the benzoate species were observed at 1604, 1552 and 1397 cm−1 and assigned to a ring stretch of the benzoate and the carboxylate asymmetric and symmetric stretches respectively [63]. Bands at 1723 cm−1 and 1239 cm−1 are due to liquid phase benzoic acid dissolved in the dioxane [64]. In addition, a band at 2053 cm−1 was observed and assigned to CO linearly adsorbed on metallic Pt. A band at 2053 cm−1 was also observed following adsorption of CO on a pre-reduced Pt/Al2O3 catalyst layer (Fig. S17). The formation of CO during benzoic acid adsorption over Pt/Al2O3 could result from decomposition or decarbonylation reactions. Decarbonylation of benzyl alcohol [65,66] and benzaldehyde [67] has been reported over Pd/Al2O3 in the liquid phase at comparable temperatures to those used in this ATR study. Ferri et al. reported the desired oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde to be insensitive to specific sites on the Pd particles; however, decarbonylation was found to occur over hollow sites on terraces of the Pd nanoparticles (Pd(111)) [68] with the presence of oxygen in the feed reducing the deactivating effect of CO adsorbed on Pd for this reaction. Under the hydrogenation conditions used within this study, CO (and possibly hydrocarbon fragments from decomposition of benzoic acid/benzaldehyde) could remain adsorbed on the Pt surface poisoning the catalyst for subsequent adsorption of benzoic acid resulting in the low activity observed experimentally over Pt/Al2O3. The reducible nature of the tin dioxide support is able to promote both the activity and selectivity to the acid carbonyl hydrogenation of benzoic acid suppressing hydrogenation of the aromatic ring and side reactions/decomposition."
10,Conclusions,"In conclusion, platinum supported on tin dioxide is active and highly selective for the formation of benzyl alcohol from benzoic acid under extremely mild reaction conditions in the liquid phase. The interaction between Pt and SnOx provides activation of the acid carbonyl group with the catalysts showing no activity for aromatic ring hydrogenation as further evidenced by the inactivity for hydrogenation of benzene. Characterisation of the catalyst shows a degree of reduction of the SnO2 support following treatment under H2 at 200 °C however, tin is present predominantly as an oxidised species although with the formation of both metallic Pt and Sn, alloy phases could also be generated. DFT suggests that interaction between the Pt and SnOx can weaken the strength of adsorption of the aromatic ring of benzoic acid rendering its adsorption unfavourable relative to the acid carbonyl group. The switch in adsorption mode with partial reduction of the tin dioxide corroborates the observed reaction selectivity with ring hydrogenation observed over Pt/C, ring adsorption and decomposition observed over Pt/Al2O3 and acid carbonyl group adsorption and hydrogenation over Pt/SnO2 with excellent selectivity to benzyl alcohol."
