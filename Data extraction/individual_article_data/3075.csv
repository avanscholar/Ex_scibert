0,Introduction,"Biomimicry-based and bioinspired engineering has been applied to designs and fabrication of membranes for separations. One approach is utilization of biomimicking materials, for example of aquaporin, in fabrication of separation membranes through the conventional processes [1–3]. Another method is building up biomimicked structures in membranes, such as channel-mediated biomimetic structures [4]. Employment of water-selective permeation channels in nanofiltration membranes have been reported for desalination and other application [5]. Pervaporation-based liquid-liquid separation employs dense membranes. The solution-diffusion model has been mostly utilized to illustrate the selective mass transportation behavior through the membranes [6]. Compared to the membranes for filtration, the effects of membrane surface structures, including chemical and morphological structures, could be more significant for the dense membranes for pervaporation. As the lotus effect being widely applied to building up superhydrophobic surfaces, Jullok et al. [7] prepared polydimethylsiloxane-based membranes being imitated with the surface characteristics of epicuticular wax of Prunus laurocerasus L. leaves. For pervaporation separation on a binary mixture of water and ethyl acetate, the membranes showed a preference for ethyl acetate permeation. He and coworkers [8] introduced a lotus-leaf-like structure to a polydimethylsiloxane membrane surface, resulting in increasing the surface hydrophobicity and enhancing the pervaporation separation performance on water-ethanol mixtures. The surface-engineered membranes exhibit water-repellant characteristics contributing to selective separation of organic components (ethyl acetate and ethanol) from water [7,8]. The above-discussed examples employed biomimicked surface engineering for construction of superhydrophobic surface of membranes to enhance the permeation of the organic component in pervaporation separation. Nevertheless, water-selective membranes are attractive for pervaporation dehydration from water-solvent mixtures [9–11] and desalination from salted water [12–16]. Based on the solution-diffusion model, a specially designed surface, which is favorable for water molecules dissolution into the water-selective membrane, is highly expected. Hydrophilic polymers [17–19] and hydrophilic surface-modification [20–22] have been widely utilized for preparation of the water-selective membranes. Nevertheless, to our best knowledge, the biomimicked surface engineering has not been applied to the hydrophilic membranes for water-selective pervaporation. Among the hydrophilic polymers reported for fabrication of water-selective pervaporation membranes, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) has received massive interests based on its unique properties (hydrophilicity, film formability, and chemical stability) [23,24]. PVA-based membranes for pervaporation applications are commercially available from several suppliers, for example of PERVAP™ membranes from DeltaMem AG (Switzerland) [25]. The PVA-based selective layers have been chemically crosslinked to enhance their operation stability. Additionally, continuous efforts with various approaches have been done for improving the performance of PVA membranes for hydrophilic pervaporation [15]. Introduction of inorganic fillers to PVA matrix for formation of the mixed-matrix membranes (MMM), which could simultaneously enhance the stability and separation performance of the membranes, could be the most attractive approach [26–29]. For minimizing the mass transportation paths and resistance, thin-film composite (TFC) membranes with thin separative layers have also been studied [30–32]. Based on the prior art, PVA has been selected as the matrix for examining the effect of biomimicked surface engineering on pervaporation desalination performance. In this work, surface engineering on hydrophilic membranes is performed with building up lotus-leaf biomimicked surface structures and chemical deprotonation on PVA membranes for pervaporation desalination. For a feeding solution of 3.5 wt% NaCl(aq), the surface-engineered PVA membrane shows a significant enhancement on the water permeation flux from 0.48 kg m−2 h−1 to 1.36 kg m−2 h−1 (at 25 °C) without any sacrifice of salt rejection. Moreover, the membrane shows a high water permeation flux of 3.86 kg m−2 h−1 at 75 °C, corresponding to a thickness-normalized water permeation flux of about 386 kg-μm m−2 h−1. The positive effect of biomimicked surface engineering on the pervaporation separation performance of hydrophilic polymers-based membranes has been demonstrated."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials PVA (molecular weight: 74,800 g mol−1, degree of deacetylation: 99.07 mol%) was received from Chang Chun Petrochemical Company (Taiwan). Maleic anhydride (MA) and acetic acid were purchased from Showa Chemical Co. Ltd. Sylgard® 184 silicone elastomer kit from Dow Corning Chemical Co. was used for fabrication of the negative templates of lotus leaves."
3,Instrumental characterization,2.2 Instrumental characterization Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded with a Spectrum Two FTIR Spectrometer of PerkinElmer Co. X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) measurements were conducted with ULVAC-PHI PHI 5000 Versaprobe II instrument using an Al Kα X-ray (1.487 keV) as a radiation source. Thermal stability of PVA membranes was evaluated with a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) of TA-Q50 TGA instrument from Thermal Analysis (TA) Co. at a heating rate of 10 °C min.−1 under a nitrogen flow of 100 mL min−1. Stress-strain curves of PVA-based membranes were measured with an Instron 5543 mechanical tester (Instron Co.) with an elongation rate of 20 mm min−1. Contact angle measurements were conducted with a First-Ten-Angstroms FTA-100 series (Chi 608) instrument with water droplets of about 6 μL. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation was performed with a HITACHI S-4800 SEM equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) for elemental analysis.
4,Preparation of negative template of lotus leaves [33],"2.3 Preparation of negative template of lotus leaves [33] Fresh lotus leaves were washed with water and dried under an ambient condition. The silicone resin precursor (Sylgard® 184 silicone elastomer kit, silicone resin/curing agent: 10/1 by weight) was coated on the lotus leaves. The samples were thermally cured at 60 °C for 24 h. The silicone resin parts were peeled off from the lotus leaf substrates, and then used as the templates for PVA membranes."
5,Preparation of PVA membranes with lotus-leaf-like surface structures,"2.4 Preparation of PVA membranes with lotus-leaf-like surface structures PVA was dissolved in water at about 90 °C to result in a 12 wt% PVA aqueous solution. After being added with MA (5 wt% of PVA) and acetic acid (0.5 wt% of PVA) as a crosslinking agent and a catalyst for PVA crosslinking reaction, respectively, the solution was stirred at room temperature for 1 h and then stand for 24 h for degas. The PVA solution was cast on the silicone templates, thermally treated at 45 °C for 18 h and at 120 °C for 2 h. The samples were immersed in water to collected the lotus-leaf-biomimicked PVA membranes (L-PVA). The PVA membranes without biomimicked surfaces were also prepared with the conventional solution-casting method with glass plates as substrates. The normal PVA membranes were coded as N-PVA. Both N-PVA and L-PVA membranes have a thickness of about 100 μm."
6,Preparation of base-treated PVA membranes,"2.5 Preparation of base-treated PVA membranes Surface treatments of the prepared PVA membranes were conducted with a 2.0 N NaOH(aq). The PVA membranes were soaked in the NaOH solution at room temperature for 0.5 h, picked out from the bath, wiped with tissue paper, and then dried in air. The base-treated L-PVA and N-PVA samples were coded as BL-PVA and BN-PVA, respectively."
7,Pervaporation desalination tests,"2.6 Pervaporation desalination tests Pervaporation desalination tests were conducted with a laboratory-assembled facility with an effective membrane area (A) of about 15.9 cm2 and a downstream pressure of 400–667 Pa [34]. While the system being stable, the weight (W) of the permeated liquid collected at the downstream for a period of time (t, about 20 min) was recorded for determination of the permeation flux (P) with equation (1) (1) P = W/(At) The salt concentration of the permeated liquid was determined with a conductivity meter and a calibration method. The salt rejection (R %) is from equation (2) (2) R ( % ) = ( 1 − C p C f ) × 100 % where Cp and Cf is the salt concentration of the permeated liquid and the feeding solution, respectively."
8,Results and discussion,
9,PVA membranes with lotus leaf-biomimicked surface,"3.1 PVA membranes with lotus leaf-biomimicked surface Chemically crosslinking has been widely applied to PVA-based membranes for enhancements of their stability. Although glutaraldehyde has been examined as an effective crosslinking agent for PVA [35], its toxicity should be considered for certain applications. On the other hand, MA has also shown great ability in crosslinking PVA based-membranes under mild conditions [36–39]. In this work MA has been utilized as a crosslinking agent for fabrication of PVA-based membranes for pervaporation desalination. With a negative template made with silicone resin, the surface structure of lotus leaf has been transprinted to the PVA membrane surfaces (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 2 collects the spectral analysis results of the pristine and crosslinked PVA membranes. In FTIR measurements, the sample did not exhibit the characteristic absorptions of MA at 1780 and 1853 cm−1, indicating there was not residual MA remained in the sample. The reaction between MA and the –OH groups of PVA would form ester linkages which could be characterized with the absorption at 1740 cm−1. Further surface characterization has been carried out with an XPS. As the C1s core-level spectra shown in Fig. 2, the increase in the peak intensity at about 288.7 eV might indicate the formation of ester groups. Nevertheless, the signal is not as significant. Moreover, the TGA thermograms of the pristine and crosslinked PVA membranes (Fig. 3 ) show the effect of chemically crosslinking on enhancing the thermal stability of the PVA membrane with a shift of the rapid thermal degradation temperature from about 294 °C to 368 °C. The crosslinked PVA sample also demonstrates an enhanced mechanical property. As the stress-strain curves shown in Fig. 3, compared to the stress strength of about 15 MPa found with the pristine PVA membrane, the crosslinked PVA sample shows a stress strength of about 38 MPa. Moreover, crosslinking PVA membrane also depresses its water uptake capacity from 109 wt% to 75 wt%. Both the pristine and crosslinked PVA membranes do not exhibit obvious changes after being soaked in a NaOH(aq) (1.0 N) at 30 °C for 24 h, suggesting their chemical stability in alkaline treatments. Fig. 4 shows the SEM micrographs of the samples obtained at different stage in fabrication of the surface-biomimicked membranes. Fresh lotus leaf exhibits a hierarchically rough structure, which possesses protrusions of about 3–4 μm with nanosized tubules. The hierarchically rough structure and wax on the surface contribute to the superhydrophobicity and water-repellent ability of lotus-leaves. The images of the silicone negative template made with the lotus leaves show small cavities which are from the protrusions of lotus leaves. The biomimmicked PVA membrane (L-PVA) shows protrusions on the surface, which is similar to what observed with lotus leaves. Although the protrusions of L-PVA also possess some rough structure, nevertheless the nanoscale tubules on lotus leaves are not clearly observed with L-PVA. The PVA membrane with a plain surface (N-PVA) shows a water contact angle of about 57°, indicating the hydrophilic feature of PVA (Table 1 ). Nevertheless, the biomimmicked L-PVA sample shows a WCA of 94°, indicating that introduction of the biomimmicked structure to the PVA membrane surface might decrease the surface hydrophilicity. As there are not significant silicon atoms being detected on the L-PVA surface with a SEM-EDX measurement, the increased WCA could not be attributed to the presence of hydrophobic silicone. As a result, the increased WCA of L-PVA might be attributed to its hierarchically rough structure and the corresponding Wenzel state of water droplets on the L-PVA surface. Both N-PVA and L-PVA have been applied to pervaporation desalination tests with a feeding solution of 3.5 wt% NaCl(aq) at 25 °C. Both membranes exhibit a salt rejection above 99.85% and similar water permeation fluxes of about 470 g m−2 h−1. Although the hierarchically rough structure might increase the surface area of the L-PVA membrane for water dissolution into the membrane, its relatively high WCA and hydrophobicity result in an offsetting effect for water dissolution. Consequently, introduction of lotus-leaf-like surface structure to PVA membrane surface almost does not bring any significant effect on the pervaporation desalination performance of the membrane."
10,Deprotonation of PVA membrane surface with a base treatment,"3.2 Deprotonation of PVA membrane surface with a base treatment In our previous work [40], deprotonation of the phenol groups of polybenzoxazine resins could be achieved with a base treatment, consequently to convert the surfaces of polybenzoxazine-based membranes from hydrophobic to be hydrophilic due to the interrupted hydrogen-bonding structure. Cheng et al. also reported partial deprotonation of PVA-based aerogel with a base treatment [41]. Based on the prior studies, the prepared PVA membranes have been treated with a 2.0 N NaOH(aq) at room temperature for 0.5 h. The corresponding BN-PVA and BL-PVA membranes exhibit WCA values of 51° and 43°, respectively. The low WCA values indicate the hydrophilicity of the membrane surfaces coming from the deprotonated –OH groups of PVA. The high surface hydrophilicity of the BL-PVA membrane could be attributed to the synergistic effect of the deprotonated PVA units and the biomimicked surface structure. Moreover, the base treatment does not obviously affect the lotus leaf-biomimicked surface morphology and structure of the membrane, supported with the SEM micrographs in Fig. 4. In the pervaporation desalination test (feeding solution: 3.5 wt% NaCl(aq) at 25 °C), both base-treated membranes (BN-PVA and BL-PVA) show a high salt rejection of about 99.9% (Fig. 5 and Table 1). The water permeation flux recorded with BN-PVA membrane is 484 g m−2 h−1, which is a little higher than the value of N-PVA (471 g m−2 h−1) due to the slight increase in surface hydrophilicity of BN-PVA membrane. On the other hand, BL-PVA membrane exhibits a water permeation flux of 1,316 g m−2 h−1, which is 2.8 times of the value measured with L-PVA membrane. The hydrophilic feature of the BL-PVA membrane surface enables water molecules covering on and dissolution into the membrane. The hierarchically rough structure biomimicked with lotus leaves increases the effective surface area of the membrane, consequently to significantly enhance the water dissolution rate into the membrane. In summary, an effect and simple approach to increase the pervaporation desalination performance of hydrophilic polymer-based membranes has been demonstrated."
11,Pervaporation desalination performance of the based-treated biomimicked PVA membrane,"3.3 Pervaporation desalination performance of the based-treated biomimicked PVA membrane Lotus leaf-biomimicked surface structure and deprotonation of PVA have shown a synergistic effect on pervaporation desalination performance of PVA-based membranes. Further pervaporation desalination tests on BL-PVA membrane have been done. Fig. 6 shows the operation temperature effect on the pervaporation desalination performance of BL-PVA with a 3.5 wt% NaCl(aq) as the feeding solution. The salt rejection rates (above 99.90%) are almost independent with the operation temperatures. The water permeation fluxes significantly increase with increasing the operation temperatures. The water permeation flux recorded at 75 °C is about 3,863 g m−2 h−1, which is about 2.92 times of the value measured at 25 °C. Moreover, while taking the membrane thickness into consideration, the thickness-normalized water permeation flux of BL-PVA membrane at 75 °C is about 386 kg-μm m−2 h−1. The high flux of BL-PVA membrane is extremely attractive for practical application. Fig. 7 shows the desalination data of BL-PVA membrane with feeing solutions of various salt concentrations at 25 °C. The water permeation fluxes decrease with increasing the salt concentrations of the feeding solutions. For a feeding solution of 15 wt% NaCl(aq), BL-PVA membrane shows a water permeation flux of about 771 g m−2 h−1, which is about 57 % of the value recorded with a 3.5 wt% NaCl(aq) feeding solution. The reduction of water permeation flux could be attributed to the relatively low driving force of water dissolution into the membrane. On the other hand, the results give a support to the BL-PVA membrane being workable for high salinity water treatments [42]. The pervaporation desalination performance of the surface-engineered PVA membrane (BL-PVA) and the data reported for other PVA-based membranes in recent publication [14,27,28,31,32,43-36] have been collected in Table 2 for a comparison. Among the PVA-based membranes, the salt rejection rate of BL-PVA is at a high level of above 99.9 wt%. The relatively low flux of BL-PVA could be attributed to its high membrane thickness. While the fluxes being normalized with membrane thickness, the high value of BL-PVA is noteworthy. Since the surface-engineering approach of this work only alters the surface structures of the PVA-based membranes, the effort could be carried out together with other methods, such as formation of TFC membranes and MMMs, to further increase the permeation fluxes and enhance the stability of the membranes."
12,Conclusions,"This work demonstrates the first example of performing biomimicked surface engineering on hydrophilic polymers-based membranes for water-selective pervaporation separation. Biomimicked surface engineering has been demonstrated as an effective approach for enhancing the performance of PVA-based membranes for pervaporation desalination. Compared to the pristine PVA membrane, a 2.8-times of water permeation flux has been recorded with the surface-engineered PVA membrane without scarifying salt rejection. This approach is highly appreciated for membranes made with other hydrophilic polymers, for example of chitosan. Moreover, since the approach only involves the very surface structures of the targeting membranes, it could be easily and reasonably integrated with other membrane modification methods, such as formation of mixed matrix membranes, reduction of selective layer thickness, and building up water-transportation channels in membranes etc., to demonstrate synergistic effects on enhancing the separation performance of prepared membranes."
