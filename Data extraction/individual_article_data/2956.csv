0,Introduction,"Rising oil prices, finite fossil fuel reserves, environmental degradation, and concerns about looming climatic changes are driving a concerted search for renewable energy sources. A large fraction of current fossil fuel consumption is due to the transportation sector which relies almost exclusively on the use of liquid fossil fuels. Partial or complete replacement of presently used carburants, gasoline or diesel, with a renewable energy carrier is thus key to averting or reducing the impending crisis. A variety of biofuels have been proposed and are presently under study, but hydrogen appears to have a number of advantages. First, its use in fuel cells is inherently more efficient than the combustion currently required for the conversion of other potential fuels to mechanical energy. Secondly, its breakdown generates no pollutants; unlike ethanol for example, whose large scale use is predicted to release large amounts of carcinogenic acetaldehyde with the generation of large amounts of smog. Thirdly, all presently studied biofuels are largely carbon neutral since the carbon released by their combustion is derived, directly or indirectly, from recently fixed atmospheric CO2. However, the emitted carbon associated with hydrogen produced by microbial fermentation is released during the production of this biofuel rather than during its utilization, thus potentially permitting easy capture of CO2 and sequestration. Thus, in this scenario, biological hydrogen production could even be carbon negative. A great deal of effort is being made to develop a future hydrogen economy, particularly in regards to its use as a mobile fuel source, and world wide there are a number of demonstration projects and prototype hydrogen powered vehicles. However, a number of technical barriers can be found in each of the three principal sectors; production, storage, and utilization. Practical deployment of hydrogen-fuelled vehicles requires breakthroughs in the production of efficient, low cost fuel cells. The major challenge in hydrogen storage is its low energy density and major research efforts are underway to find effective means of storing hydrogen for use as a transportation fuel. Finally, renewable, sustainable means must be sought to produce hydrogen. A variety of renewable technologies, e.g. wind turbines, photovoltaic cells, might be used to first generate electricity and then produce hydrogen through electrolysis. However, this approach suffers from at least two drawbacks. First, captured energy is lost during electrolysis, with current technologies having only about 65% efficiency. Secondly, this involves the conversion of a high quality energy carrier, electricity, which could be used to supply some of the substantial stationary power demands currently supplied mainly by burning fossil fuels, to one of lower quality, hydrogen. Another possible solution to the renewable production of hydrogen also being actively pursued is the biological production of hydrogen, biohydrogen. Here again a variety of avenues have been envisaged, using either the direct capture of solar energy [photobiological], or relying on the utilization of energy-rich organic materials resulting from the previous solar energy driven photosynthetic fixation of carbon [1]. Each approach has distinct advantages and disadvantages with challenging technical barriers to practical application. The photobiological approach could use water as substrate producing hydrogen and oxygen through biophotolysis. However, its effectiveness is limited by relatively low solar energy conversion efficiencies, and its concommittent production of oxygen is highly problematic. For one thing, highly explosive hydrogen/oxygen gas mixtures could be generated, but more importantly, hydrogen production by hydrogenase is a highly oxygen sensitive process. This field has been recently reviewed [2–5]. Another approach which does not suffer from these limitations [but has some of its own, as discussed in detail below] is the anaerobic hydrogen fermentation of biomass-derived compounds, so-called dark fermentation [1,6]. The fundamental biochemical and microbiological aspects of this process, recent studies, and strategies for potentially overcoming present limiting factors are the subjects of this review."
1,Principles of dark fermentation,"Hydrogen is a key compound in the metabolism of many anaerobic, as well as a few aerobic, microorganisms. Many organisms have the capacity to use this energy-rich molecule when it is available in the environment and derive electrons from its oxidation to drive energy generation. In the absence of external electron acceptors, some organisms dispose of excess electrons generated during metabolism by reducing protons to hydrogen. In both cases, key enzymes are hydrogenases. There are two main types of hydrogenases which are phylogenetically distinct and contain different active sites where the relevant chemistry occurs; Ni–Fe hydrogenases and [FeFe] hydrogenases. The occurrence, enzymology, and maturation of both Ni–Fe and [FeFe] hydrogenases have been extensively studied [7–11]. In general, NiFe hydrogenases are poised to catalyze hydrogen oxidation, although exceptions are known (e.g. Hyd3 of the enteric bacteria is responsible for hydrogen evolution), and [FeFe] hydrogenases are extremely active in proton reduction, although again there are exceptions (e.g. the periplasmic [FeFe] hydrogenases of sulphate-reducing bacteria). Thus, depending upon the organism, hydrogen evolution may be catalyzed by a soluble [FeFe] hydrogenase (e.g. Clostridia) or a special class of membrane bound NiFe hydrogenase, Ech (e.g. Escherchia coli). The Ech hydrogenases, found in a variety of organisms, are interesting since they appear capable of coupling hydrogen evolution with generation of a membrane proton gradient [9,12]. In fact, depending upon the organism and growth conditions, Ech hydrogenases are thought to be capable of coupling hydrogen oxidation to ferredoxin reduction using the membrane gradient to drive the necessary reverse electron transport or to energize the membrane during proton reduction to hydrogen. These hydrogenases have also been found in hyperthermophilic archaeon, Pyrococcus furiosus [13,14] and the gram-positive Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis [15] and may be relatively widespread as they were found by recent analysis in 56 different bacterial and 28 different archeal genomes [9]. Of the variety of possible substrates, practical hydrogen fermentations are restricted to carbohydrate-rich materials. Proteins are hydrolyzed to amino acids which are principally fermented in pairs by so-called Strickland reactions where one amino acid serves as the electron acceptor for the oxidation of the second amino acid [16]. These reactions thus yield no hydrogen. Lipids are hydrolyzed to glycerol and long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs). LCFAs are degraded to acetate and hydrogen in natural systems by syntrophic bacteria [17], but this reaction is only possible at the extremely low P H 2 s (partial pressure of hydrogen) maintained by the associated methanogenic or sulphate-reducing bacteria. Thus, some wastes, even though present in large amounts, such as effluents from the secondary treatment of sewage, are poor substrates for hydrogen production due to their relative lack of fermentable carbohydrates. As discussed in detail previously [6], pyruvate is the key intermediate in the principal fermentation pathways leading to hydrogen from the glycolytic breakdown of carbohydrate-derived sugars. Two different enzymes are implicated in the breakdown of pyruvate to intermediates involved in hydrogen production depending upon the metabolic type; pyruvate:formate lyase (Pfl) in enteric-type mixed-acid fermentation and pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (Pfor) in clostridial-type fermentations. In both cases, the acetyl-CoA produced can be converted to acetate with concommittent ATP synthesis from the acetyl-phosphate intermediate. In the mixed-acid fermentation of enteric bacteria (a facultative anaerobe) (Fig. 1 ), pyruvate is cleaved to acetyl-CoA and formate without the immediate production of reducing equivalents. There is actually no advantage to the bacterium to produce hydrogen unless active metabolism causes the pH to drop whereupon the Fhl system (formate:hydrogen lyase) is induced and the conversion of formic acid to hydrogen alleviates the acidification. Acidic conditions also favor the increased conversion of pyruvate to lactic acid, with the formation of one molecule of acid instead of potentially two (acetic and formic). Obviously, this reaction diverts reductant from the hydrogen production pathway. Since hydrogen is derived from formate, and a maximum of two formates are formed per glucose, maximum hydrogen yields can be predicted to be 2H2/glucose. In this type of fermentation the NADH produced during the glycolytic production of pyruvate must be reoxidized by the production of a reduced organic compound, typically ethanol. Clostridia (strict anaerobes) convert pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, and CO2, producing reduced ferredoxin (Fig. 2 ). The reduced ferredoxin transfers electrons to a [FeFe] hydrogenase, driving hydrogen evolution. This assures the production of two moles of hydrogen per mole of glucose consumed. Unlike the organisms carrying out mixed-acid fermentation, hydrogen fermenting anaerobes like Clostridia possess a pathway that allows them, under the proper conditions (low P H 2 ), to couple NADH oxidation to proton reduction to hydrogen. The pathways(s) by which this occurs is not totally clear. Although there were early reports of NADH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity in crude extracts [18], this activity has never been described in molecular detail, nor has a gene encoding this activity been identified. Instead more recent work suggests a number of ways in which NADH can be used to drive hydrogen evolution. Some organisms have been shown to contain heteromeric [FeFe] hydrogenases, Hnd hydrogenases, that can couple directly with NAD(P) (H) since they contain subunit homologues of some Complex I proteins [9]. However, they may serve different functions depending upon the organism. In Desulfovibrio fructosovorans Hnd appears to function physiologically in the reduction of NADP with hydrogen [19]. However, in the Firmicutes, this enzyme may catalyze H2 evolution from NADH, as has been shown in T. tengcongensis [15]. Thus, these organisms are potentially capable, under the right conditions, of producing additional hydrogen by reoxidizing the NADH generated during glycolysis. Since two moles of NADH are produced during glycolysis of glucose, up to a maximum of two additional molecules of H2 could potentially be generated by this pathway. Thus, these organisms appear to be capable in theory of producing up to 4H2/glucose. However, proton reduction with NADH is unfavourable since the redox potential of hydrogen (∼450mV at neutral pH, STP) is appreciably lower than that of the NADH/NAD couple (∼320mV). Thus, production of H2 with electrons derived from NADH is only possible at greatly reduced P H 2 . The inability to reoxidize NADH by this latter pathway leads to its oxidation by pathways that produce reduced organic compounds; commonly butyric acid, but also butanol and acetone in solventogenic Clostridia. Some studies with these organisms have also noted that as the medium acidifies, butyric acid production is increased at the expense of hydrogen although the molecular mechanism is unclear. It is interesting to note that many organisms actually contain genes encoding both pyruvate:formate lyase (Pfl) and pyruvate:ferredoxin (flavodoxin) oxidoreductase (Pfor). Usually one of these plays a major role in fermentation (e.g. Pfl, E. coli) whereas the second one is involved in minor pathways (e.g. Pfor, E. coli, which is involved in reduction of the flavodoxin necessary for formation of the glycyl radical active site of Pfl [20]). In fact, organisms may contain multiple homologues of these genes which function in pathways completely unrelated to hydrogen production. For example, E. coli has five pfl homologues, one of which is necessary for anaerobic threonine degradation. Obviously, it is therefore impossible to predict the fermentation pathways of a particular organism from its complement of Pfl and/or Pfor encoding genes."
2,Progress in H2 production by dark fermentation,"In practice, hydrogen yields are below the maximums of 2H2 or 4H2/glucose noted above, and numerous recent studies have examined the effect of various parameters on hydrogen yields and production rates. Many of these results have been recently reviewed [21–28] and only some highlights and specific examples are discussed here. A variety of manipulations have been proposed to improve hydrogen yields (Table 1 ) and some of the recent progress in carrying these out is reviewed below."
3,Optimization of bioprocess parameters,"3.1 Optimization of bioprocess parameters Many factors that fall under the rubrique of bioprocess parameters have been studied including; type of organism/organisms, pH, substrate loading (OLR – organic loading rate), type of reactor/growth conditions (batch, sequencing batch, continuous; CSTR, UASB, etc.), type of substrate (pure carbohydrate, various waste streams), etc. Of course, particular experimental conditions are dictated by the goal of the study. Pure cultures growing on defined substrates are best for examining limiting factors and the effects of genetic manipulations whereas mixed cultures are probably more appropriate for fermentation of complex substrates. With pure cultures, fermentation patterns (and products) can be controlled by the choice of organism, but with mixed cultures, metabolic pathways have to be manipulated through bioprocess parameters [29]. Because of the complex nature of the substrates, and the often unknown composition of the mixed culture which is very dependent upon inoculum source and history, it is difficult to compare one study with another. An idea of the variability possible is given by a recent study which examined substrate conversion by a mixed culture of four different pure monosaccharides and found that productivity, conversion efficiencies, and even products varied greatly [30]. There is a great deal of interest in this area at present and the results of many studies are appearing in the literature. It is not the intention here to list all recent publications (many of these are tabulated in some of the recent reviews cited [21–28]) but merely to point out some generalizations that can be made and to give a few highlights. pH control is important as high fermentation rates lead to strong acidification due to the production of organic acids. This can affect both product distribution and even cell viability [31–33]. A variety of OLRs have been tested, and although the results are highly variable given the different substrates used, it is obvious that high substrate concentrations are to be preferred from an operational standpoint since they potentially lead to high volumetric production rates. As discussed elsewhere, the effect of OLR, at least with mixed cultures, on hydrogen yields is somewhat contradictory with no facile explanation for the disparity in these results [27]. With pure cultures, hydrogen yields are favored at low substrate [carbon] concentrations whereas hydrogen productivity is favored at high substrate [carbon] concentrations [34,35]. Recent studies with mixed cultures also generally support this idea, although the relationship seems more complex [36–38]. In terms of ease of operation, CSTR-type reactors are probably to be preferred, and are useful for model studies since they assure maximum mixing and homogeneity. However, in practical terms, it would appear that some kind of fixed bed or granular-type reactor would be best adapted since they allow the achievement of very high cell densities and permit the reactor to be run at HRTs that are independent of the bacterial growth rate [37–40]. Thus, very high volumetric rates of production can be achieved with these types of reactors, often ten times or more that of CSTRs. As noted, various types of substrates have been used with many studies characterizing conversion from pure sugars. Again, in practical terms, it is obvious that these substrates, or any food-derived substrate, will not be available, and useful conversions will be those that utilize various waste streams, generating energy while at the same time carrying out necessary waste treatment. As noted above, carbohydrate-rich waste streams should be targeted, and hydrogen fermentations are indeed favored by relatively high C/N [41,42]. With pure cultures nitrogen limitation produces maximum yields [34,35]. Nevertheless, some very nitrogen poor substrates may require amendment with a more nitrogen-rich waste to achieve better hydrogen production [43]."
4,Elimination of competing reactions,"3.2 Elimination of competing reactions As discussed under principles, a number of changes can be proposed that should increase hydrogen yields. For one, many hydrogen producing organisms also contain hydrogenases whose physiological function is to oxidize hydrogen to protons and produce energy, either by participating in hydrogen cycling to create a proton gradient, or using the extracted electrons to generate reduced compounds useful in biosynthetic reactions (e.g. NADH). Thus, many have suggested eliminating these “uptake” hydrogenases and this has been carried out in practice in a number of cases. However, these hydrogenases, although present, might only have small effects since they are poised by the metabolic conditions of the cell and sensitive to the available hydrogen concentration. Indeed, as predicted, elimination of Hyd1 and Hyd2 of E. coli leads to modest increases in hydrogen yields [34,35,44,45]. Other competing reactions have been targeted, in particular those that divert pyruvate away from the pathway leading to hydrogen production. Thus, ldhA (lactate dehydrogenase) mutants of E. coli again show somewhat increased levels of hydrogen production [34,35,45,46]. This type of strategy could be applied to clostridial-type fermentations (i.e. elimination of the butyrate pathway, etc.) but to my knowledge this has not yet been reported."
5,Decrease H2 partial pressure,"3.3 Decrease H2 partial pressure Theory predicts that reducing P H 2 should increase the hydrogen yields of Clostridial-type fermentations (see above, Principles). Several studies have examined this question, mainly by using inert gas sparging, and found increased hydrogen yields under these conditions, although the degree of improvement is highly variable between studies (see [27]), ranging from relatively little change [47] to a remarkable doubling of hydrogen yield to 3.9mol H2/mol glucose [48]. Surprisingly, one study which actually examined dissolved hydrogen concentrations of cultures undergoing moderate sparging found that, due to severe gas liquid mass transfer limitations, dissolved hydrogen concentrations were quite high, appreciably above the threshold predicted to be necessary to favor H2 production from NADH [49]. It was suggested that the sparging effect could be due to the reduction in substrate availability for acetogens, but of course this would apply only to mixed cultures. Recent studies that examined this question were contradictory [50,51]. More work is needed to settle this point."
6,Use thermophilic strains,"3.4 Use thermophilic strains Hydrogen production at higher (thermophilic or hyperthermophilic) temperatures could possibly benefit from both increased rates and increased yields. Rates are expected to increase due to the expected thermal activation of chemical (biochemical) reactions. In addition, as previously discussed, thermodynamic considerations suggest that yields should be higher at higher temperatures, and a variety of studies on hydrogen production by thermophilic organisms appear to bear this out [6]. Indeed, in a recent continuous culture study of hydrogen production with the thermophile, Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus, a very high yield, 4H2/glucose was obtained at a low dilution rate and low carbon loading [52]. As seen with mesophilic fermentations, yields decreased, but productivities increased, with higher dilution rates. However, several factors seem to mitigate against the practicality of such a thermophilic process. For one thing, even though yields are high, with many thermophilic fermentations volumetric productivities are only a fraction of what has been observed with mesophilic fermentations, thus mandating the use of much larger reactors to achieve the same total hydrogen production, i.e. increasing capitol costs. As well, a thorough cost–benefit analysis needs to be done to see if the costs associated with the increased energy demands to heat such reactors is at all justified by the increased yields obtained."
7,Introduce more active H2ase,"3.5 Introduce more active H2ase Another strategy that might be applied is to increase potential hydrogenase activity by overexpressing a hydrogenase; either by increasing the expression of an endogenous hydrogenase, or by the heterologous expression of a highly active [FeFe] hydrogenase. While it is obvious that one possible outcome of this strategy could be to increase hydrogen production rates, increased hydrogenase activity might also increase yields if a limitation in hydrogenase activity created a bottleneck that forced electron flow into another pathway thus producing a product other than hydrogen. Alleviation of this restriction should promote more substrate being converted into hydrogen. Of course, the heterologous expression of hydrogenase is complicated by the fact that it might also be necessary to coexpress the required maturation genes as well as any specific electron carrier systems (ferredoxin, etc.) or the enzymes required in turn to reduce them. In either case, it is not clear that this would have the intended effect since it is not evident that it is the quantity of hydrogenase available that limits hydrogen production. It could rather be the rate of electron flow through the electron carriers that feed hydrogenase, or even the flux through the reductant generating metabolic systems, e.g. glycolysis, that is rate limiting. In fact, a priori one would think that this would be the case given the very high turnover number of hydrogen evolving hydrogenases (∼9000 for [FeFe] hydrogenases). Nevertheless, a few studies have shown that increasing the expression of Hyd3 or the Fhl system of E. coli increases, to some degree, hydrogen production in that organism [34,35,53,54] and expressing the native hydrogenase of Clostridium paraputrificum from a plasmid increases hydrogen production by 1.7 fold [55]. Finally, heterologous expression of [FeFe] hydrogenase in organisms such as E. coli that does not normally contain this enzyme system is somewhat daunting since the expression of multiple genes is required; at least hydA, the structural gene, as well as hydE, hydF, and hydG, the maturation proteins [56]. In general, even with the co-expression of all these genes, in vitro hydrogenase activity has been quite low. Recently, heterologous expression has been made somewhat easier by the construction of a synthetic hydF-hydEhydG-hydA operon [57]. Nevertheless, it is unclear how well this [FeFe] hydrogenase could couple to the normal anaerobic metabolism of E. coli. Indeed, this system can be used to express active [FeFe] hydrogenase, but in vivo hydrogen accumulation is very low [58] and there appears to be very little correlation between the amount of active hydrogenase formed and the amount of H2 accumulated [59]."
8,Prognosis for H2 production by dark fermentation,"The key barrier to the practical application of fermentative hydrogen production is that, as discussed above, conversion yields by known metabolic pathways, at P H 2 s that would be needed for a practical fermentation, appear to be limited thermodynamically and metabolically to a maximum of 4 moles of H2 per mole of glucose. The basis for this, as well as the limits of many other chemotrophic metabolisms are discussed in a classic and elegant review by Thauer et al. [60]. The relevant metabolic reaction, which will be referred to as the Thauer limit, is shown below: Present bacterial fermentations at best (theoretical): C6H12O6 +2H2O→4H2 +2CO2 +2CH3COOH [acetate] In theory: C6H12O6 +6H2O→12H2 +6CO2. It should be pointed out that this reaction, or similar low energy yielding reactions such as the oxidation of volatile fatty acids, can occur if the P H 2 is kept extremely low (∼50Pa for butyrate oxidation) either by growth in the presence of a hydrogen consumer [61] or by extreme purging [62]. Although efforts are underway to discover new hydrogen producing organisms, or to mine novel hydrogenase genes from vast environmental metagenomic studies, it seems unlikely that these approaches will successfully find or create strains that can overcome the Thauer limit. Since in theory 12H2 can be extracted from a hexose such as glucose (see above) this represents a maximum conversion efficiency of 33%, too low to be practical considering that this means that the majority of the COD of waste streams remains untreated and that other processes, such as anaerobic digestion, would be more effective. Thus, to be practical, means must be found to either, preferably, extract the remaining potential hydrogen, or at least recover the total energy content. A variety of methods have been proposed to do this (see Table 2 )."
9,Second stage – methane fermentation,"4.1 Second stage – methane fermentation One process that appears to be achievable in the short term is to essentially separate the natural ecology and metabolism of an anaerobic digester into two stages, here often called a two-phase system. Thus, in the first stage, conditions (pH (acidic), HRT (relatively short), etc.) are chosen to favor fermentation of the substrate to hydrogen and organic acids, by favoring the growth of acidogenic bacteria, and in the second stage conditions are chosen that are favourable to methanogenesis (more basic pH, longer HRTs). A number of recent studies have reported on the successful operation of such two-stage systems [63–66]. The disadvantage here is that two different gas streams are created and in reality, since the majority of the substrate is converted to methane, this is really a methane fermentation in which one is pulling off a little hydrogen. However, at least with some substrates (organic solid wastes), there may be advantages over a traditional methane fermentation, since the first stage acts effectively in solubilisation [65]. In addition, combining the two gas streams would create a hydrogen–methane mixture (∼20–30% H2 (after removal of CO2), 80–70% CH4) shown to burn cleaner than methane alone [67]. Another advantage in this type of two-stage system appears to be an increased tolerance to high OLR. Although there is some variability in results between laboratory-scale studies, it has been shown that high yields of H2 (2.4H2/hexose) can be achieved [66]. A pilot scale study using kitchen waste which gave 80% COD removal showed that relatively high yields of hydrogen could be obtained while at the same time methane yields were two-fold higher than a comparable single-stage process [65]."
10,Second stage – photofermentation,"4.2 Second stage – photofermentation In another proposed process to recover additional hydrogen from the products of a dark hydrogen-generating fermentation, non-sulfur purple photosynthetic bacteria can be used to capture light and quantitatively convert organic acids to hydrogen in a reaction that has been known for nearly sixty years [68,69] and has been termed photofermentation. A great deal of research has gone into this area which has been recently reviewed [70]. This process has even been proposed to be used in a nutrient recycling scheme for the establishment of a Martian habitat [71]! In photofermentation, hydrogen evolution is driven by nitrogenase, and since this enzyme is ATP-dependent [the requisite ATP is formed via the photosynthetic capture of light energy], hydrogen evolution is essentially irreversible. Thus in principal photofermentations are capable of the complete conversion of organic compounds, usually organic acids, to hydrogen even against considerable pH2s. Even in practice, nearly stoichiometric conversion to hydrogen of some organic acids can be obtained, although sometimes conversion efficiencies are substrate dependent [72,73]. There have been a few studies where this capacity has been used to demonstrate the conversion of organic acids, principally acetate, produced during a first stage dark fermentation of sugars (glucose, sucrose) to hydrogen, thus increasing the overall hydrogen yield, although yields were well below stoichiometric [74–76]. Further research could very well improve yields. A number of factors restrict the practical application of such a process. For one thing, nitrogenase-driven hydrogen evolution is potentially sensitive to the nitrogen content of the medium/substrate since fixed nitrogen both represses nitrogenase synthesis and reversibly inhibits enzyme activity. However, this limitation can be potentially overcome either by genetic manipulation [77] or selection [78] to remove nitrogenase regulation. The most severe constraint is the fact that photosynthetic efficiencies, with either solar radiation or tungsten lamps, are very low. At even moderate light intensities, the majority (>80%) of captured light is dissipated as heat [79]. Obviously, this increases greatly the surface area required for the production of a given quantity of hydrogen. This, combined with the potentially high cost of transparent, hydrogen-impermeable, photobioreactors, presents very significant hurdles for the development of a practical process based on photofermentation."
11,Second stage – electrohydrogenesis,"4.3 Second stage – electrohydrogenesis In this recently (2005) described approach, an electrical input provided to a modified microbial fuel cell (MFC) provides the energy necessary to convert organic acids, such as acetate, to hydrogen [80,81]. In fact, these types of cells are rather versatile and have been shown to be able to generate hydrogen from a variety of substrates, including some wastewaters [82]. Moreover, it is not necessary to start with a pure, defined bacterial culture with the desired characteristics, the appropriate bacteria can be selected during operation. As originally constituted, these bioelectrochemical cells consisted of an anode chamber where, like in MFCs, electrogenic bacteria catabolise substrate using the electrode as an electron acceptor for their metabolism thereby generating an electrical potential. Both the anode and cathode were operated anaerobically and connected by a proton (cation) exchange membrane. The potential generated from a substrate such as acetate (300mV) isn't sufficient to drive hydrogen evolution at the cathode, so supplementary voltage input is required; ∼110mV in theory, but because of electrode overpotentials this is actually >200mV. Although admittedly elegant in its demonstration of the thermodynamic principles to the manipulation of microbial metabolism for use in the biotechnological production of fuels, hydrogen evolution rates and efficiencies were quite low. A number of problem areas can be singled out, and some of these have been at least partially dealt with in more recent publications. First, as is the case with MFCs, current densities obtained at the anode (graphite) are quite low. Some improvement has been attained by pretreatment of the electrode surface [83], but further gains are desirable. Secondly, the membrane separating the two chambers allows passage of cations, Na+, K+, which are present at much higher concentrations than protons at the near neutral pHs required. The resulting pH rise at the cathode limits hydrogen production while acidification at the anode inhibits microbial activity. Thus, replacement with an anion selective membrane (protons are transferred via negatively charged phosphate ions) leads to some improvement [84,85] and in fact, it has been demonstrated that it may be possible to do away with the membrane altogether [86]. A further hinderance is that the cathode usually employed contains platinum, too expensive for the obtained current densities. In a novel approach to overcoming this problem, it has been proposed to replace the usual cathode with a biocathode where bacteria attached to an appropriate graphite surface catalyze hydrogen evolution [87]. However, it is not clear that a sufficiently high catalytic density can be achieved using this approach. Thus, electrohydrogenesis is a novel approach, but it remains to be seen if sufficiently high volumetric rates can be achieved with nominal electrical inputs. Currently, high volumetric rates (∼3m3H2/m3 reactor/day), which are however still almost two orders of magnitude lower than those seen with dark fermentations, are only observed at high (∼800mV) applied voltages."
12,Metabolic engineering,"4.4 Metabolic engineering Another possible path to increasing hydrogen yields is to alter metabolism through metabolic engineering to convert more of the substrate to hydrogen. Tools for metabolic engineering; genetic manipulation, metabolic flux analysis, etc., are now well developed and it has been suggested for some time that these be applied to biohydrogen [1,88,89]. As yet however, there is a lack of studies where this has successfully been carried out. These ideas have been applied to increase flux through known fermentative pathways of E. coli [45,54], but no enhancement past the inherent metabolic limit was found or is to be expected. Similarly, Hyd3 activity has been increased by protein engineering [90], but again it is not apparent how this could lead to increased yields above the metabolic limit. Several avenues can be pursued in the future in attempts to overcome the thermodynamic/metabolic barriers to high level hydrogen yields. One possibility is to introduce NAD(P)H dependent hydrogenases/pathways. In a very recent study, a ferredoxin-dependent NAD(P)H:H2 pathway was introduced into an E. coli strain expressing a [FeFe] hydrogenase, the requisite maturation enzymes, and ferredoxin [58]. Some increase over basal activity was noted, and variation of hydrogen production with presumed partial pressures led the authors to conclude that the system was severely limited thermodynamically and impractical. However, levels of expressed hydrogenase activity are quite low in this strain making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Additionally, it might be possible to augment hydrogen production by increasing cellular NAD[P]H production through metabolic engineering. A theoretical analysis of metabolic fluxes suggested that up to 9H2/glucose could be obtained this way [91], but this analysis did not take into account the unfavourable thermodynamics of such a process. Another approach that has been suggested is to use reverse electron flow to generate reduced ferredoxin with enough reducing power to drive hydrogen evolution by hydrogenase [1]. Of course, this requires energy input and it was suggested that a small amount of respiration could be used to generate an electrochemical gradient that would drive ferredoxin reduction. This has not yet been tested and it is not obvious how to construct the appropriate pathways. One possibility is to use a Rnf-type system. These have been found in a number of bacteria and archaea; including several Clostridia species [92,93], several acetogens [94,95] and an archaea [96] where they are thought to usually function to conserve energy under anaerobic conditions by creating an ion gradient when reduced ferredoxin is used to reduce NAD. However, and of direct pertinence to what is being proposed here, these complexes are also known to function in the reverse direction, using an electrochemical gradient to drive ferredoxin reduction from NADH. The reduced ferredoxin generated in this way participates in nitrogen fixation in at least several bacteria [97,98]. Thus, in the future, it might be possible to adapt this system to driving biohydrogen production by dark fermentation past the present metabolic barrier."
13,Conclusion,"The metabolic pathways of the major fermentative hydrogen producing organisms are now well understood. The present pathways appear to place severe limits on the attainable yields with at most 33% of the potential electrons going into hydrogen production. A number of studies with either pure or mixed cultures have examined the effects of various parameters; pH, temperature, bioprocess parameters, competing reactions, etc. on hydrogen production and have shown that some improvement is possible. Nevertheless, additional approaches are needed to surpass the metabolic constraints. A number of systems potentially capable of exceeding 4H2/glucose have been proposed and are under active study including; two stages with methane production as a second stage, two stages with photofermentative production of hydrogen as the second stage, a second stage electrohydrogenesis, and metabolic engineering. Despite some encouraging results, each approach is still faced with daunting challenges that need to be addressed in future research before their practicality can be realized or even assessed."
