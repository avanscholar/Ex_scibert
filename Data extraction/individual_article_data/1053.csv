0,Introduction,"Nanofiltration (NF) membrane has been widely used in water softening, brackish water desalination, waste water treatment, dye purification, food processing and organics removal [1,2]. Currently, thin-film composite polyamide (TFC) nanofiltration membrane prepared through classic interfacial polymerization occupies the leading position in the market share of nanofiltration [3]. The polyamide separation layer is formed at the interface of water phase and organic phase through the reaction of amine monomers and acyl chloride monomers. Despite of its excellent separation performance, the major downfall of polyamide based TFC membrane is its inherent susceptibility to oxidants (e.g., chlorine) [4,5]. In addition, this interfacial polymerization process relies heavily on organic solvents (e.g., hexane), arising additional pressures for treating organic wastewaters. Therefore, alternative strategies for fabricating of novel nanofiltration membrane in a more environmentally friendly and sustainable way with excellent chlorine and fouling resistance are highly imperative [6]. To tackle the environmental concern of nanofiltration membrane production, a full aqueous fabrication strategy is preferred. In this scenario, water soluble polyelectrolytes (e.g., polyallylamine hydrochloride (PAH), polyacrylic acid (PAA) and polysodium 4-styrenesulfonate (PSS) etc) have been used for fabricating nanofiltration membrane through layer-by-layer self-assemble way [7,8]. In this process, positively and negatively charged polyelectrolytes were successively deposited on support to form separation layer. Thickness, surface charge, morphology and separation performance can be well controlled through this smart way [9–16]. More recently, nanofiltration membrane can be obtained from an aqueous phase separation strategy using homogeneous polyelectrolyte complexation [17]. Despite of the avoiding of organic solvents, large amount of acid and alkali was used to initiate the phase separation process. Meanwhile, polydopamine surface coating on membrane and polydopamine based hybrid membrane has attracted many attentions due to its facile, green and controllable characteristics [18–23]. The polydopamine based separation layer was usually formed through the polymerization and self-assemble of dopamine monomers [24]. Various oxidants, additives and analogues were developed to finely control its polymerization/deposition rate, morphology, thickness and separation performance [25–34]. Although the above separation layers were fabricated using water soluble monomers and polymers, availability of these materials were limited. Specifically, most of the products were formed in bulk solution rather than on membrane surface. Recent reported electrospraying strategy offered a more precise control on supply of raw materials for separation layer formation, membrane morphology and thickness [35–40]. Moreover, no additional wastewaters produced during separation layer fabrication through electrospraying, which supplied a green and sustainable way. However, recent nanofiltration membrane obtained through aqueous dopamine electrospraying exhibited poor desalination property due to the ineluctable aggregation of polydopamine [41,42]. Therefore, a nanofiltration membrane fabricated by this sustainable way with high desalination performance is required. Chlorine resistance is an important prerequisite for nanofiltration membrane due to the residual chlorine in feed solution and exposure to high concentration chlorine during membrane cleaning [4]. The weak chlorine resistance of polyamide nanofiltration membrane was mainly attributed to the sensitivity of amidic nitrogen, where its lone electron pair tends to share with the electron cloud of chlorine [43]. Many strategies have been developed for enhancing chlorine resistance of polyamide membranes, such as surface coating, surface grafting and blending [44–49]. More recently, polyester membrane with excellent chlorine resistance was reported [50,51]. However, the above membranes were all produced based on interfacial polymerization at the interface of aqueous and organic solvent. Chlorine resistant nanofiltration membrane fabricated through an aqueous and more sustainable strategy was rarely reported yet. In this study, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/polydopamine (PDA) hybrid nanofiltration membrane was fabricated through aqueous electrospraying. No wastewaters were produced during this fabrication process as nearly all the solvent (water) was evaporated. The incorporation of PDA in PVA increased membrane permeance and antioxidant property. The obtained PVA/PDA hybrid membrane exhibited excellent antifouling and chlorine resistance properties. The proposed strategy in current study might supply more opportunities for nanofiltration membrane fabrication in a green and sustainable way."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Polyethersulfone (PES) ultrafiltration membrane with a molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of 20000 Da was purchased from RisingSun Membrane (China). Commercial nanofiltration membrane such as NF90 and NF270 were supplied by Dow Filmtec (America). Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA,1750 ± 50), acetone, anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 37–38% hydrochloric acid (HCl) were obtained from Sinopharm group chemical reagent Co., Ltd (China). Dopamine hydrochloride (98%), sodium hypochlorite (NaClO, contain 6–14% active chlorine), tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (Tris, 99.9%), poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG, with molecular weight of 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 Da), glutaraldehyde (GA, 50 wt% in water) and humic acid (HA) were supplied by Aladdin (China)."
3,Membrane fabrication,"2.2 Membrane fabrication Schematic diagram of the membrane preparation process was showed in Fig. 1 . Specifically, PVA was dissolved in Tris-HCl buffer solution (10 mM, pH = 8.5) at 95 °C with mechanical stirring for 6 h to obtain homogeneous PVA solution (1.0 g/L). After PVA solution was cooled to room temperature, dopamine hydrochloride was added in the above solution with concentrations of 0.5 g/L, 1.0 g/L, 2.0 g/L and 3.0 g/L. A piece of PES membrane was mounted on the collector of electrospraying setup (ET-3556H, Ucalery, China) with a constant rotating rate of 80 rpm. Freshly prepared PVA/dopamine solution was loaded in a syringe with a metal needle and feed rate was set as 0.75 mL/h. Distance between PES membrane (collector) and metal needle was kept at 10 cm. Applied voltage was about 12 kV during electrospraying. After 4 h of electrospraying, PVA/dopamine composite membrane was removed from the collector and kept in air for further reaction (about 24 h) to obtain the PVA/PDA membrane. The obtained membranes were labeled as M0, M0.5, M1, M2 and M3, respectively. Afterwards, PVA/PDA composite membranes were immersed in glutaraldehyde (GA) solution for 4 h to crosslink PVA. A certain amount of GA (5.0 wt%) was added into water/acetone (water content was 40 wt%) solution. pH of the solution was adjusted to about 1.5 using 1.0 M HCl. After that, obtained membrane was rinsed thoroughly with deionized (DI) water and store in DI water for further use. The crosslinked membranes were correspondingly marked as C-M0, C-M0.5, C-M1, C-M2 and C-M3."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, AXIS SUPRA, Kratos, UK) and infrared spectrometer (Micro-FTIR, Cary660 + 620, Agilent, USA) were used to analyze the chemical composition of membranes. Cold field high resolution scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, S4800, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL2100, Japan) were used to observe surface and cross-section morphologies of membranes. The surface zeta potential of prepared membranes was evaluated by an electrokinetic analyzer (SurPASS 3, Anton Paar, Austria). Scanning probe microscope (SPM, Dimension ICON, Bruker, America) was employed to observe surface roughness of samples. pH meter (PHB-4, LiChen, China) is used to adjust pH value. Salt and PEG concentrations were tested by a DDSJ-308A conductivity meter (Leici, China) and a Multi NC 2100 total organic carbon analyzer (TOC, Germany), respectively. Surface hydrophilicity of membranes was measured by a contact angle measurement (OCA25, Dataphysics, Germany)."
5,Separation performance evaluation,"2.4 Separation performance evaluation The home-made cross-flow filtration apparatus was used to evaluate separation performance of membranes with an effective filtration area of 6.15 cm2. All membranes were stored in DI water for direct test. Before recording pure water permeation flux at 5.0 bar, all membranes were pre-pressed at 6.0 bar for 1 h. Cross-flow velocity was about 0.8 m/s. Pure water permeance (PWP, Lm−2h−1bar−1) was calculated using flowing equations: (1) PWP = J w Δ P (2) Jw = V A Δ t where Jw (Lm−2h−1) is the water flux, ΔP (bar) is the operation pressure, V (L) is the permeate volume, Δt (h) is the filtration time and A (m2) is the effective filtration membrane area. Solute rejections (R) of membranes were also measured at 5.0 bar and pre-pressed under 6.0 bar for 1 h. Concentrations of initial salt (Na2SO4, MgSO4 and NaCl) and PEG (with molecular weight of 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 Da) were kept at 1000 mg/L. Solute rejection (R, %) was calculated by the following equation: (3) R ( % ) = ( 1 - C p C f ) × 100 where Cp and Cf represent the concentration of permeation and feed solution respectively."
6,Antifouling performance evaluation,"2.5 Antifouling performance evaluation HA was chosen as model foulant to evaluate antifouling properties of membranes. HA was dissolved in DI water with concentration of 500 mg/L. Antifouling experiments were carried out in cross-flow device as used in flux evaluation. All membranes were firstly pre-compacted for 2 h at 6.0 bar, then water fluxes (Jw0) of membranes were adjusted to the same flux (50 L m−2h−1) to better compare their antifouling performances. Antifouling experiments were initiated after replacing DI water by HA solution. Membrane flux was recorded every 20 min during 12 h of continuous filtration. Pure water flux of membranes (Jw1) was evaluated again after membrane was thoroughly rinsed with DI water for 1 h. Total flux decline ratio (FDR) and flux recovery ratio (FRR) were calculated to evaluate membrane antifouling performance through the following equations: (4) F D R ( % ) = ( 1 − J p J w 0 ) × 100 (5) F R R ( % ) = J w 1 J w 0 × 100 where Jp was the water flux of membrane at 12 h."
7,Chlorine resistance evaluation,"2.6 Chlorine resistance evaluation Membranes were immersed in NaClO solution (pH = 4.0, active chlorine concentration was 1000 mg/L) with constant stirring for different time (2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 10 h and 12 h). After that, membranes were thoroughly rinsed by DI water. Water flux and salt rejection (Na2SO4) performance of membranes was tested again according to the method described in section 2.4. The total free chlorine expose amount (ppm·h) represented the degree of chlorination of membranes. At least three membrane samples were tested and the average value was presented in the above experiments."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Surface morphologies and chemical composition of membranes,"3.1 Surface morphologies and chemical composition of membranes PVA has been considered as a good candidate for fabrication of membrane due to its ease of film formation, water solubility, hydrophilicity and chemical stability [52]. Varieties of membranes have been prepared using PVA, such as reverse osmosis membrane, nanofiltration membrane and pervaporation membrane et al. [52]. Although PVA electrospray for nanofiltration membrane preparation has been previously reported, additional steps were usually needed (e.g., hot water treatment, hot pressing treatment and film transfer et al. [53–55]). PVA nanofiltration membrane with excellent water flux and salt rejection properties through one-step electrospray strategy was rarely reported yet. Effect of PVA concentration on membrane formation was firstly studied. Results in Fig. 2 showed that nanofibers were obtained when PVA concentration was 2.0 g/L due to the high solution viscosity. Smooth PVA membrane can be obtained when PVA concentration was lower than 2.0 g/L (e.g., 1.0 g/L and 0.5 g/L). However, long electrospray time was required for a certain thickness of PVA using low PVA concentration. Therefore, 1.0 g/L PVA aqueous solution was selected for membrane formation in the following experiments. Results in Fig. 3 a showed that many pores can be found on PES support membrane. However, the pores were disappeared after electrospray (Fig. 3b–f) and a clear PVA/PDA layer can be observed in cross-section of membranes (Fig. 3 a'- f'). GA crosslinked PVA layer usually exhibited dense structure, which presented relatively low water flux [56]. In order to enhance water flux of crosslinked PVA layer, polydopamine was incorporated. The reasons for using polydopamine were attributed to 1) water solubility of its precursor (dopamine); 2) rigid chemical structure with great free volume compared with linear PVA molecular chains; and most importantly 3) the excellent compatibility between PVA and polydopamine due to the strong hydrogen bonding network [32]. In addition, hydrogen bond between PVA and polydopamine suppressed the common aggregation problem of dopamine polymerization leading to a more homogeneous dispersion of polydopamine in PVA. Moreover, surface roughness was an important factor for membrane antifouling performance. No agglomeration of PDA particles was observed on the surface and cross section of membranes. Average surface roughness (Ra) of fabricated PVA/PDA membranes was in the range of 5.3–7.1 nm, which was quite low than most polyamide based nanofiltration membranes [57,58]. Despite of fine control on surface roughness, membrane thickness can also be well manipulated through electrospray. SEM images in Fig. 4 showed that thickness of PVA/PDA layer increased from 55 ± 5 nm to 185 ± 5 nm when electrospray time increased from 2 h to 8 h. Membrane thickness was linearly related to electrospray time (Fig. 4e). PVA has been widely used as separation layer and its permeability was strongly affected by its thickness. A comparison was presented in Table 1 about the thickness of PVA based separation layer. Results in Table 1 indicated that the fabricated PVA/PDA layer was thinner than most of previously reported literatures with similar separation performances (e.g., rejection for Na2SO4 or other solutes). The reason was mainly attributed to the 3-D printing character of electrospray method [36], where PVA/dopamine solution can be dispersed into microdropltes. The polymerization and agglomeration of PDA was restricted by the adjacent PVA network via hydrogen bonding interaction. Results in Fig. 4f exhibited that permeance was significantly increased as the decrease of thickness. Meanwhile, rejection for Na2SO4 of electrosprayed PVA/PDA layer was higher than 90% when electrospray time was longer than 4 h. The optimal electrospray time was determined as 4 h in consideration of Na2SO4 rejection. The obtained C-M2 membrane fabricated using 4 h electrospray exhibited a pure water permeance of 14.5 L m−2h−1bar−1 and Na2SO4 rejection of 92.7%. ATR-FTIR results in Fig. 5 a showed that a broad peak at 3200–3600 cm−1 appeared after electrospray attributed to the strong hydroxyl stretching vibration peaks of PVA and PDA. Meanwhile, methyl, methylene and ester carbonyl characteristic peaks at 2880 cm−1, 2760 cm−1 and 1690 cm−1 also appeared after PVA/dopamine electrospray on PES substrate [65]. Moreover, hydroxyl stretching vibration peaks move to a low wave number as the dopamine amount increased in electrospray solution, which indicated the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between PVA and PDA [32]. The incorporation of PDA in PVA/GA network was further verified by XPS results as typical nitrogen element can be found in C-M2 compared with C-M0 (Fig. 5b). In addition, crosslinking degree of PVA can be quantitatively analyzed through the ratio of C/O. The C/O ratio was 2.0 in pure PVA network without crosslinking. However, it was increased to 3.25 in fully-crosslinked PVA network by glutaraldehyde. Results in Table 2 showed that C/O ratio was about 2.53 in C-M0, which indicated a crosslinking degree (CD) of 15.5%. After dopamine was introduced in electrospray solution, the obtained C-M2 membrane exhibited an apparent CD value of 17.8%. Actually, this value was not accurate due to the effect of carbon and oxygen atoms in PDA. After proportionally deduction of carbon and oxygen according to nitrogen atom, amended CD value of C-M2 membrane was about 13.5%. The results indicated that incorporated PDA slightly decreased CD value of PVA. However, ATR-FTIR results in Fig. 5a showed that hydrogen bonding was formed between PVA and PDA. Therefore, the decreased CD of PVA and homogeneous dispersion of PDA in PVA might endow the membrane with enhanced water permeance and relatively high desalination performance."
10,Separation performance of membranes,"3.2 Separation performance of membranes Pure water permeance of pristine PES membrane was about 95 ± 1.5 L m−2h−1bar−1 (Fig. 6 a), and it was decreased to 80 ± 1.5 L m−2h−1bar−1 after dopamine electrospray on PES membrane (PES-PDA). However, membrane permeance was just about 6.0 ± 0.2 L m−2h−1bar−1 after PVA electrospray followed by GA crosslinking (C-M0). The reason was mainly due to the dense structure of crosslinked PVA. As PES-PDA membrane showed high permeance compared with C-M0, PDA layer exhibited low mass transfer resistance than GA crosslinked PVA layer. GA treated PES-PDA (C-PDA) membrane showed relatively high permeance (87.7 L m−2h−1bar−1, date not shown in Fig. 6). Therefore, incorporation of PDA in crosslinked PVA network might enhance membrane permeance. Results in Fig. 6a showed that membrane permeance increased from 6.0 ± 0.2 L m−2h−1bar−1 to 20.4 ± 0.6 L m−2h−1bar−1 when dopamine concentration increased from 0 to 3.0 g/L in electrospray solution. Permeance enhancement was mainly attributed to the following three reasons: 1) hydrophilicity of polydopamine component as water contact angle of C-M2 and C-M3 membrane was slightly lower than C-M0 membrane (Fig. 6b); 2) additional water channel supplied by incorporated PDA as clear PDA nanoparticles can be observed in PVA/PDA hybrid layer (see TEM images showed in Fig. 6c and d); 3) decreased crosslinking degree of PVA due to the greater spatial structure of dopamine and polymerized PDA (as shown in Table 2). Fig. 7 a showed that electrosprayed PDA layer provided no rejection enhancement to PES membrane. However, rejection for Na2SO4 was significantly increased to 95.3% if GA crosslinked PVA layer was introduced on PES membrane (C-M0). Rejection for MgSO4 and NaCl of C-M0 membrane was about 89.5% and 27.0% respectively. As PDA incorporation enhanced water permeance, rejection performance was slightly decreased. Rejection for Na2SO4, MgSO4 and NaCl of C-M2 membrane was about 92.7%, 83.4% and 19.4%, respectively. Rejection property of the membranes was mainly contributed by GA crosslinked PVA, as GA treated PDA layer (C-PDA) exhibited low rejection for Na2SO4 (26.3%), MgSO4 (10.2%) and NaCl (7.3%) (Fig. 7b). Meanwhile, molecular weight cut-off of C-M2 increased to about 600 Da from 460 Da of C-M0 membrane (Fig. 7c), which was mainly attributed to the incorporation of polydopamine. In addition, incorporation of polydopamine made PVA/PDA layer more negatively charged as negatively charge character of polydopamine [26]. The negatively charged property of obtained PVA/PDA hybrid membrane contributed the rejection for salts due to Donnan effect [66]. Moreover, PVA/PDA hybrid membrane showed rejection performance for salt in the order of Na2SO4>MgSO4 >NaCl, which also confirmed the Donnan effect. Separation performance of C-M2 membrane fabricated through aqueous electrospray was compared with the results reported from other literatures. Results in Table 3 showed that C-M2 membrane exhibited relatively higher pure water permeance and rejection for Na2SO4."
11,Anti-fouling and anti-chlorine properties of membranes,"3.3 Anti-fouling and anti-chlorine properties of membranes Fouling is the key obstacle that limited the lifespan of membrane. Humic acid is the most common foulant during nanofiltration process. Therefore, humic acid was used as model foulant in current study to study antifouling performance of membranes. Prevalent NF270 and NF90 nanofiltration membranes were used for comparison. Results in Fig. 8 a showed that flux of NF90 membrane was rapidly decreased after humic acid was introduced to feed solution. The other three membranes (e.g., NF270, C-M0 and C-M2) showed relatively slow flux decrease. It might be mainly due to the rougher surface (Fig. S1a) and low hydrophilicity (Inset of Figs. S1a and S1d) of NF90. Results in Fig. S1b showed that average surface roughness of NF90 was about 47.1 nm, which was quite higher than other membranes (see Fig. 3). Water contact angle of NF90 membrane was about 71±2° (Fig. S1a), which was also higher that other three membranes (see Fig. 6b). In addition, among NF270, C-M0 and C-M2 membranes, C-M2 (Total flux decline ratio, FDR = 6.1%) membrane showed more stable flux compared with NF270 (FDR = 10.7%) and C-M0 (FDR = 15.9%) membrane. As for antifouling property difference of C-M0 and C-M2 membrane, it might be mainly attributed to different applied pressure. To better compare antifouling performance of membranes, initial flux was adjusted to the same level. As C-M0 membrane showed low flux compared with C-M2 membrane (Fig. 6a), high applied pressure was required for C-M0 membrane to achieve the initial flux. Therefore, foulants were easily deposited on C-M0 membrane surface than C-M2. Long-term separation performance of C-M2 membrane was evaluated using Na2SO4 solution (Fig. 8b) in a 48 h continuous filtration process. Results in Fig. 8b showed that C-M2 membrane exhibited quite stable membrane permeance and Na2SO4 rejection. Besides flux decline, flux recovery ratio (FRR) of membrane was an important index for analyzing antifouling property. Higher FRR value indicates better membrane regeneration performance. FRR of C-M2 membrane was as high as 98.9%, which was slightly higher than NF270 (96.6%) and C-M0 (94.5%) membrane. In general, low FDR and high FRR make C-M2 membrane a better candidate as antifouling membrane. Fig. 9 a showed that pure water flux of NF90 and NF270 membrane was rapidly decreased within 2000 and 4000 ppm h. The reason was mainly due to the slight amino chlorination and the membrane tighten upon the conversion of amide N–H group to N–Cl [72]. However, water flux of C-M0 and C-M2 membrane was quite stable within 4000 ppm h. Although normalized water flux of C-M0 and C-M2 membrane was decreased after 4000 ppm h chlorine exposure, their flux was higher than NF90 and NF270 membrane in a broad range of chlorine exposure (e.g., 4000–12000 ppm h). Results in Fig. 9b showed that Na2SO4 rejection of membranes was not so sensitive to chlorine exposure, which was mainly due to the membrane tighten as discussed above. There was no significant rejection difference before and after chlorine exposure. The above results indicated that C-M0 and C-M2 membrane exhibited better chlorine resistance than polyamide based NF90 and NF270. Chemical structure change was analyzed through ATR-FTIR to further understand the different chlorine resistance property of polyamide based membrane and electrosprayed PVA/PDA hybrid membrane. Results in Fig. 9c showed that hydrogen bonded CO (amide I) at 1608 cm−1 and N–H (amide II) at 1540 cm−1 in polyamide based membrane was weakened or disappeared after chlorine exposure due to their sensitivity to free chlorine [73,74]. However, there was no acyl carbonyl in PVA/PDA hybrid C-M0 and C-M2 membrane. Instead, the ester carbonyl groups at 1690 cm−1 in C-M0 and C-M2 membrane was quite stable for chlorine exposure. Therefore, the better chlorine resistance property of electrosprayed PVA/PDA hybrid membrane was mainly attributed to the stable carbonyl structure in membrane."
12,Conclusions,"PVA/PDA hybrid nanofiltration membrane was fabricated through aqueous electrospray. Thickness and surface roughness can be well controlled through 3-D printing like electrospray. PDA incorporation significantly enhanced membrane permeance from 6.0 ± 0.2 L m−2h−1bar−1 (C-M0) to 20.4 ± 0.6 L m−2h−1bar−1 (C-M3) due to its greater spatial structure compared with PVA. In addition, hydrogen bonding between PVA and PDA facilitated the homogenous dispersion of PDA in PVA network. The obtained PVA/PDA hybrid nanofiltration membrane (e.g., C-M2) showed superior antifouling performance towards humic acid than commercial NF270 membrane. Total flux decline ratio (FDR) and high flux recovery ratio (FRR) of C-M2 membrane was 6.1% and 98.9% respectively, which was better than commercial NF270 membrane (FDR = 10.7%, FRR = 96.6%). Moreover, C-M2 membrane exhibited better chlorine resistance property than NF270 membrane due to the absence of chlorine sensitive acyl carbonyl structure in PVA/PDA separation layer. The PVA/PDA hybrid membrane fabricated through aqueous electrospray can offer a nanofiltration membrane with enhanced antifouling and chlorine resistance property."
