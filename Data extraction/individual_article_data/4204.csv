0,Introduction,"Concerns over the effect of global emissions of CO2 and other local air pollutants such as nitrogen and sulphur oxides (NO x and SO x ) and fine particulates on the environment and human health have led to the significant research on the use of alternative energy carriers [1,2]. Currently, hydrogen is an emerging alternative to conventional fuels, because it emits no CO x when used in PEMFC (polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell). Conventionally, hydrogen is produced via catalytic steam reforming, partial oxidation and auto thermal reforming of natural gas or steam reforming of alcohol [3]. However, a major drawback with these routes is the formation of large amounts of CO x as by-products. Hydrogen generated by these methods can be utilized in fuel cells only if CO is completely eliminated since its presence even at 10 ppm level in H2 stream strongly deteriorates the efficiency of fuel cell anodic catalyst [4,5]. However, the CO in H2 stream can be avoided by direct decomposition of methane in the absence of O2/air environment by a simple catalytic decomposition. Therefore, the catalytic decomposition of methane (CDM) has become a promising approach to produce CO x -free H2 [5–10]. From commercial and economical standpoint, CDM over metal catalysts is a useful technology because it produces pure H2 and carbon nanofibers; the former is a clean fuel and the latter is a highly valuable compound [11–13]. Thus, produced hydrogen by CDM process is CO x -free and can be utilized directly in PEMFC without further purification. The second product is carbon nanofiber, which is a useful compound as pure graphitized carbon materials have many unique properties, for example, they possess high resistant to strong acids and bases, electrical conductivity, high surface area and good mechanical strength as catalyst support and as a H2 storage material [11,14]. During CDM process, methane is adsorbed followed by deposition of carbon on the exposed surface of the metal catalyst. The diffusion of deposited/precipitated carbon occurs towards the opposite face of the metal where they crystallize in the form of continuous graphite-like structure. The rate of carbon deposition is controlled by isothermal carbon diffusion through the metal particle. The deactivation of the catalyst could be due to the blocking of active catalytic sites by carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface [15]. Suelves et al. reported that the catalyst deactivation depends upon the operating conditions such as reaction temperature and methane flow [16]. Transition metals such as Ni [17–20], Fe [21] and Co [22] are well known to be effective for methane decomposition into hydrogen and carbon nanofibers. The nickel-based catalysts are active at low temperatures and provide a higher yield of H2 per mass unit of the active component [23–25]. However, these catalysts are easily deactivated at high temperatures. Hence, modification of Ni-based catalysts opens up an interesting area to increase the yield of H2 and stability at higher temperatures in methane decomposition [26]. In addition, introduction of another metal or metal oxides to a Ni catalyst may provide significant changes in the activity and stability at a higher temperature [27]. The dopings of metals such as Cu, Rh, Pd, Ir and Pt to Ni catalysts are studied by Takenaka et al. and the results showed that Pd doping alone increased the Ni activity through an alloying effect [26]. However, the other studies revealed that doping of Cu may enhance significantly the performance of Ni catalysts towards methane decomposition reaction [28–33]. The layered double hydroxides (LDHs), anionic clays or hydrotalcite (HT)-type compounds, are a family of materials that have gained much attention in recent years [34,35]. In this investigation we have studied the influence of La doping on the performance of modified Ni-Al2O3 and Ni-SiO2 samples for methane decomposition. The nano sized Ni particles were obtained from the HT precursors of Ni-La-Al2O3 prepared by a co-precipitation method while keeping Ni2+ content constant. The physicochemical characteristics of fresh, reduced and used samples are studied using BET surface area (SA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), H2 temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), O2 pulse chemisorption and Raman spectroscopy. The CDM activities are measured in the temperature range of 500 to 650 °C at ambient pressure and in the absence of any carrier gas flow during the process."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts The Ni-Al2O3 (2 : 1), Ni-SiO2 (2 : 1), Ni-La-Al2O3 (2 : 0.1: 0.9), Ni-La-SiO2 (2 : 0.1 : 0.9), Ni-La-Al-SiO2 (2 : 0.25 : 0.25 : 0.5) catalysts were obtained by a co-precipitation method. In a typical procedure, required amount of tetra ethyl orthosilicate as a source for silica is taken in a beaker having 500 mL distilled water and precipitated using required amount of 0.25 mol/L HCl and stirred for 1 h. The silica gel precipitate is added simultaneously with solution A containing a mixture of metal (Ni and/or La and/or Al) nitrates; and solution B containing a base mixture of 1 : 1 volume of 2 mol/L NaOH and 1 mol/L Na2CO3 was added slowly while maintaining a constant pH∼9 throughout the addition. Under similar protocol using Ni, La and Al nitrates, the Ni-Al and Ni-La-Al samples were prepared. Thus, produced precipitate is thoroughly washed with distilled water until the pH drops to the pH of distilled water, dried at 100 °C for 12 h, and subsequently calcined at various temperatures in the range form 350 to 750 °C in static air for 5 h."
3,Characterization of catalysts,"2.2 Characterization of catalysts The XRD patterns of the samples were obtained on a Rigaku miniflex X-ray diffractometer using Ni filtered Cu K α radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) from 2θ = 10° to 80°, at a scan rate of 2 °/min with the beam voltage and a beam current of 30 kV and 15 mA, respectively. The surface areas of the fresh catalysts were measured by N2 physical adsorption at 77 K in an Autosorb-I (Quantachrome) instrument. The specific surface area was calculated by applying the BET method. For TEM analysis, the samples were dispersed in a methanol solution and suspended on a 400-mesh, 3.5 mm diameter Cu grid and images were taken using JEOL 1010 high-resolution transmission electron microscope. The Raman spectra for the structural characterization of deposited carbon in deactivated catalysts have been acquired with a Horiba Jobin-Yvon lab ram HR spectrometer using a laser beam excitation of λ = 632.81 nm. The H2-TPR analysis was carried out in a quartz micro-reactor interfaced to gas chromatography with thermal conductivity detector unit. For TPR analysis the sample of about 50 mg was loaded in an isothermal zone of a quartz reactor (i.d. = 0.6 cm, length =30 cm) heated by an electric furnace at a rate of 10 °C/min to 300 °C in helium gas flow at a rate of 30 mL/min, which facilitates the desorption of physically adsorbed water. After degassing, the sample was cooled to room temperature and the helium gas was switched to reducing gas of 5% H2 in argon (30 mL/min) and the temperature was increased to 700 °C at a ramping rate of 5 °C/min. Hydrogen consumption was measured by a standard TPR of Ag2O under similar protocol by analyzing effluent gas. The steam formed during reduction was removed by a molecular sieve trap. Prior to O2 pulse chemisorption analysis, the sample was reduced at 550 °C in H2 stream for 2 h then the sample was cooled to 260 °C in helium gas, outgassed at this temperature for 30 min, followed by titration with 5.01% O2 in helium gas at 260 °C. The O2 uptakes were calculated assuming the formation of NiO phase [36]. The carbon analysis data of deactivated catalysts were collected with VARIO EL analyser instrument."
4,Activity measurements,"2.3 Activity measurements The CDM activities were performed in the temperature range of 500 to 650 °C at atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed vertical quartz reactor (i.d = 2 cm, length = 46 cm), operated in a downflow mode. Methane supplied by Bhuruka gases limited (99.99%) is used directly without any diluents gas such as helium. The experimental conditions used were as reported earlier with a catalyst charge of 30 mg, CH4 flow rate = 30 mL·min−1, i.e., GHSV of 180 L·h−1·g−1 cat [5,13]. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was reduced in the temperature range of 400–600 °C with 5% H2 in N2 for 2 h. The reaction was continued until all the catalysts were deactivated. The catalysts were weighed before and after each experiment. The outflow gas was analyzed by Varian CP-3800 GC with TCD. The first analysis was done 5 min after methane was fed over the catalyst and further analysis was done at a regular interval of 10 min using a 6-port auto sampler. The mass balance was done by CH4 conversion, H2 yields and the carbon accumulation on deactivated catalysts."

6,CDM activity measurements—time on stream analysis,"3.1 CDM activity measurements—time on stream analysis Methane decomposition activity measurements are carried out over modified Ni-Al2O3 and Ni-SiO2 catalysts in a fixed-bed reactor in the temperature range of 500–650 °C at atmospheric pressure. Carbon and hydrogen are regarded as the only products and the reaction proceeded selectively [17]. An experimental error of the order of ±2 in activity evaluation studies was noted during the evaluation. The CDM activity is measured by considering certain parameters such as methane conversion, overall carbon accumulation (gC/gcat) of the catalyst and total run time of the reaction in order to compare the activities of various catalysts. All the measurements were performed under similar conditions in order to exemplify the influence of La doping. The following reaction occurs during the process: CH4 → C + 2H2; ΔH o = 75.6 kJ · mol−1 Figure 1 shows that Ni-La-Al2O3 displayed superior performance than other catalyst systems. The methane conversion was high in the initial stages and decreased rapidly or gradually with time on stream until the catalyst was finally deactivated due to carbon deposition on the catalyst surface. The carbon deposited on the surface could cover the active sites or accumulates at the entrance of the pores, prohibiting further access of methane, which may be a reason for the deactivation of catalysts. This aspect was verified by Raman analysis, carbon content estimations and XRD analysis of the deactivated catalysts which were recovered from the reactor after each run. The H2 yields were estimated from the kinetic curves of the methane conversion and reported in Table 1 . The high hydrogen yield ca. 1013 molH2 ·mol−1 Ni over Ni-La-Al2O3 catalyst corroborated the sustainability and longevity of La-modified Ni-Al than the other catalysts. Metallic Ni is known to be active component for the thermal decomposition of methane. Al2O3 or SiO2 are inactive materials for CDM reaction and are only responsible to increase the degree of dispersion of the Ni species on the catalyst surface [37]. Additionally, most of the mechanical properties exhibited by the prepared catalysts are due to the presence of alumina and/or SiO2 phase particularly for CDM process. In this investigation the amount of Ni is kept constant to study the influence of La on the CDM activity. All the catalysts displayed a similar trend of catalytic behaviour: initially higher conversion rates (Figure 1) and rapid decrease in the H2 production rate or gradually to some extent with time on stream. The CDM reaction proceeded for a while but subsequently deactivated completely. The cause of catalyst deactivation is well documented and our earlier investigations revealed the possible reasons over Ni-supported catalysts during the CDM process [17–20]. Life of the catalyst depends upon the nature of carbon deposited on the surface. Nielsen and Trimm reported that the carbon growth involves a gas phase reaction on the surface which eventually dissolves in the metal and would precipitate at a dislocation of the particle to form graphite [38]. Among the tested samples the Ni-La-Al2O3 (2 : 0.1 : 0.9 mole ratio) displayed higher activity with an initial conversion of ca. 50% and a total carbon accumulation of 104 gC·g−1 cat over a total run time of 1800 min under the reaction conditions in this study. These results suggest that La can enhance methane decomposition activity of Ni, inhibiting the formation of a graphite layer on nickel surface. These results show that La can be a good third component in case of Ni-Al catalyst when an appropriate amount is taken [39]."
7,Optimization of reaction temperature on CDM activity,"3.2 Optimization of reaction temperature on CDM activity The CDM activities were measured over Ni-La-Al2O3 (2 : 0.1 : 0.9) catalyst at different reaction temperatures in the range of 500 to 650 °C and data were plotted in Figure 2 . The initial methane conversions of about 21%, 22.2%, 41% and 51.8% are observed at reaction temperatures of 500, 550, 600, and 650 °C, respectively. These results are expected since the decomposition of methane is an endothermic process. The reason for deactivation of the catalysts is well reported in our earlier reports [17–20]. It appears that at high reaction temperatures the catalyst is rapidly deactivated. Figure 3 represents the overall H2 yield at various reaction temperatures. H2 yield is lower at high temperature owing to fast accumulation of carbon that ultimately results in the deactivation of the catalyst. H2 yields of ca. 573, 1300, 750, and 352 molH2 ·mol−1 Ni are observed at 500, 550, 600, and 650 °C reaction temperatures with total run time of 44, 40, 30, and 16 h, respectively. Thus, it is suggested that a reaction temperature of 550 °C is the optimal for obtaining good hydrogen yield over Ni-La-Al (2:0.1 :0.9) catalyst."
8,Influence of calcination temperature on CDM activity,"3.3 Influence of calcination temperature on CDM activity Methane decomposition activity depends upon NiO domain size. The influence of calcination temperature over Ni-La-Al2O3 (calcined in the range from 350 to 750 °C) (2 : 0.1 : 0.9) catalyst on CDM activity is shown in Figure 4 . It shows that the H2 yields increased with an increase in calcination temperature up to 450 °C and then a further increase in the calcination temperature results in drastically decreased H2 yields. Accumulation of lower carbon at higher calcination temperature is owing to the agglomeration of NiO particles that result in the increased NiO domain size during pretreatment [18,19]. The higher catalytic activity of the samples calcined at 450 °C may be due to the formation of nano sized Ni metal particles."
9,Influence of reductive pretreatment temperature on CDM activity,"3.4 Influence of reductive pretreatment temperature on CDM activity The influence of reduction temperature on CDM activities is measured over Ni-La-Al2O3 (2 : 0.1 : 0.9) catalyst and the data are presented in Figure 5 . The sample reduced at 550 °C showed higher CDM activity than the samples reduced at other temperatures. The CDM activities over modified Ni-Al2O3 and Ni-SiO2 samples revealed that La-modified Ni-Al2O3 sample was found to be superior to the other catalysts. Ni-La-Al2O3 sample calcined at 450 °C and reduced at 550 °C produced higher H2 yield at a reaction temperature of 550 °C when compared to the other samples. Based on the activity data, the high CDM activity of Ni-La-Al2O3 catalyst is rationalized by various adsorption and spectroscopic techniques."
10,Discussion,
11,Characterization of fresh and reduced catalysts,"4.1 Characterization of fresh and reduced catalysts The powder XRD patterns of fresh modified Ni-Al2O3 and Ni-SiO2 catalysts (Figure 6a ), calcined at 450 °C revealed diffraction lines at 2θ = 37.28°, 43.3°, 62.9° are attributed to the NiO phase [19]. The Ni-La-Al-SiO2 sample showed reflections at 2θ = 22.52° and 29.57° are due to La2O2CO3 phase [ICDD #25–0423] along with NiO. The absence of Al2O3 or SiO2 phases are possibly due to the proper mixing of these oxides within the bulk of NiO obtained during the preparation of the catalyst. The crystal domain size of NiO in fresh calcined and Ni in reduced samples is determined by Scherrer formula, and the data were reported in Table 2 . It is observed that the NiO domain size is marginally varied upon La introduction into Ni-Al2O3 and Ni-SiO2 catalysts. XRD patterns of all the samples reduced at 550 °C showed (Figure 6b) diffraction lines attributed to metallic Ni (ICDD # 87–0712) except Ni-La-SiO2. The presence of minor NiO peaks in reduced Ni-La-SiO2 may be a reason for the low CDM activity of Ni-La-SiO2. XRD patterns of fresh Ni-La-Al2O3 (2 : 0.1 : 0.9) samples calcined at various temperatures in the range from 350 to 750 °C are presented in Figure 6(c). The reflections at 2θ = 37.28°, 43.3° and 62.9° are pertaining to the NiO phase [19]. It is also observed that the diffraction lines are slightly sharpened with an increase in calcination temperature owing to the agglomeration of NiO to form large crystallites during calcination. The NiO and metallic Ni domain sizes are reported in Table 3 along with their H2 yields obtained during CDM. It is clear that the NiO domain size increased with an increase in calcination temperature, which is more apparent at higher temperature, i.e., 750 °C. Conversely, the Ni metal surface areas decreased. Furthermore, the lower H2 yields for the catalyst calcined at 750 °C are owing to its large NiO crystallite size. XRD patterns of reduced samples showed (Figure 6d) diffraction lines attributed to only metallic Ni (ICSD# 87–0712). Figure 7 represents the TPR patterns of La-modified Ni-Al2O3 and Ni-SiO2 samples calcined at 450 °C. TPR pattern of Ni-SiO2 showed two-stage reduction, a more intense broad reduction signal centered at 691 °C correspond to bulk NiO species with a shoulder at 550 °C [40]. The high temperature peak at 600 to 650 °C is corresponding to the reduction of dispersed Ni2+ interacted with alumina or silica. In the absence of alumina the Ni-SiO2 and Ni-La-SiO2 samples were reduced slightly at elevated temperature compared to Ni-Al2O3 and Ni-La-Al2O3 samples. These results indicate that in the presence of alumina, the NiO species are reduced at lower temperatures. TPR analysis indicated (Figure 7) that the Ni-SiO2 and La-modified Ni-SiO2 samples were reduced at slightly higher temperatures than the Ni-Al and Ni-La-Al samples. Increasing calcination temperature, the NiO particle size was linearly increased (Table 3), as a result, the H2 yields were drastically decreased. These results exemplify that the CDM activity is dependent upon the Ni metal surface. From the activity data it can be concluded that the La-modified Ni-Al sample calcined at 450 °C and reductively pre-treated at 550 °C showed tremendously high hydrogen yields at a reaction temperature of 550 °C. A higher hydrogen yield over Ni-La-Al sample was explained based on the nature of deposited carbon characterized by XRD, TEM and Raman analysis of the deactivated samples. The nickel metal surface areas of modified Ni-Al2O3and Ni-SiO2 samples are measured by O2 pulse chemisorption and the results are correlated with their H2 yields obtained from CDM activity. It can be clearly seen that the H2 yield is directly proportional to the Ni metal surface area of the catalysts."
12,Characterization of deactivated catalysts,"4.2 Characterization of deactivated catalysts The completely deactivated samples were analysed by XRD and the diffraction patterns are reported in Figure 8(a) . Reflections at 2θ = 26.28°, 45.2°, 53.9° and 77.0° are attributed to graphitic carbon [ICDD # 01–0640] and the diffraction lines appeared at 2θ = 44.4°, 51.8° and 76.4° are due to the presence of metallic nickel [ICDD # 04–0850]. The appearance of a graphitic carbon phase is predominant over metallic Ni phase [41]. XRD patterns of the Ni-La-Al2O3 (2 : 0.1 : 0.9) catalyst calcined at different temperatures and used at 550 °C reaction temperature are showed in Figure 8(b). These results revealed strong diffraction lines due to both graphitic carbon and metallic Ni phases with Ni-La-Al sample calcined at 450 °C. The morphology of deposited carbon can be determined from TEM images of the deactivated sample. Figure 9 represents the TEM image of deactivated Ni-La-Al2O3 catalyst. It is observed that the Ni metal is occupied at the tip of the carbon filament and the Ni metal particle size is found to be ca. 30 nm. The size of the filamentous carbon (ca. 31 nm) is more or less equal to Ni metal occupied at the tip of the carbon nanofibers [16,17]. These results are in good agreement with the mechanisms proposed in the literature for filamentous carbon growth, which suggests that the diameter of carbon nanofibers must be approximately equal to the size of Ni particle [42]. All the deactivated catalysts were recovered in an inert gas and subsequently estimated for carbon contents using CHNS analysis. The XRD analysis of the deactivated catalysts revealed the presence of graphitic carbon. It is evident from Table 1 that the activity and the longevity of the catalyst can be correlated with the amount of deposited carbon. The CHNS analysis of deactivated samples revealed the carbon accumulation of about 108, 45, 30, 24 and 14 gC·g−1 Ni on Ni-La-Al, Ni-Al, Ni-La-Si, Ni-La-Al-Si and Ni-Si catalysts, respectively. The Raman spectroscopy is a useful tool for characterization of the structure of carbon nanofibers. The nature of deposited carbon is confirmed by Raman spectra of the modified Ni-Al2O3 and Ni-SiO2 catalysts and the spectra are reported in Figure 10 . The Raman spectra displayed two distinct bands. The one cantered at around 1320 cm−1 (D-band) can be indexed to disordered carbon attributed to structural imperfection of graphite or the presence of carbon nanoparticles and amorphous carbon. The Raman shift at around 1580 cm−1 (G-band) can be ascribed to the in-plane carbon-carbon stretching vibrations from carbon with a rather ordered structure [43,44]. The degree of crystallinity of deposited carbon can be obtained from the frequency and intensity of Raman D and G bands. The ratio of peak area of the D band to that of the G band I D/I G is considered as an index for the crystalline order of graphite which is inversely proportional to the average plane size of the perfect graphenes; that is, the graphitization degree of carbons is higher at lower I D/I G values [45]. Figure 11 is a plot of full width at half maximum (FWHM) of G-band peak against I D/I G ratios (calculated from Raman data) and the carbon accumulation on the deactivated samples (CHNS). It is observed that with the increase in FWHM, the I D/I G ratio decreased. Similar relationship between the I D/I G ratio and the FWHM is observed for carbon nanofibers reported by Alvarez et al. [46]. The carbon accumulation against the G-bandwidth suggests the formation of highly ordered carbon over Ni-La-Al2O3 (2 : 0.1 : 0.9) where I D/I G ratio is lower compared to other catalysts. The high CDM activity on Ni-La-Al2O3 (2 : 0.1 : 0.9) catalyst could be possibly due to the deposition of a high amount of ordered carbon which eventually accumulated more amount of carbon and sustained for long time when compared to the other catalysts. The CDM activity of Ni-La-Al2O3 may also attributed to the high Ni metal surface area when compared to the other samples."
13,Conclusions,"In summary, the CDM reaction parameters are optimized under various calcination, reduction and reaction temperatures using pure CH4. Hydrogen yields are dependent upon the Ni metal surface of the modified Ni-Al and Ni-SiO2. The La-modified Ni-Al displayed improved CDM activity than the Ni-SiO2 and La-modified Ni-SiO2 samples. The filamentous carbon is analyzed by TEM and graphitic nature of carbon is observed by XRD analysis of the deactivated catalysts. It is observed that the size of carbon nanofiber is almost equal to the size of the Ni particle. Characteristics of ordered and disordered carbons are defined by Raman and XRD spectra of the deactivated catalysts. The O2 pulse chemisorption results indicated that high Ni metal surface area on Ni-La-Al demonstrated enhanced hydrogen yields, which is rationalized based on the nature of deposited carbon. Finally, the better performance of Ni-La-Al is characterized by well dispersed Ni particles, high Ni metal surface area and accumulation of highly ordered carbon, which eventually produced higher hydrogen yields."
