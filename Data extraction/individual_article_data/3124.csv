0,Introduction,"Energy production based on rapidly depleting fossil fuels is becoming increasingly unsustainable. The associated problem is the emission of green house gases, which are the major cause of environmental pollution. Among the possible solutions to this worry is the use of renewable energy sources [1]. It has been realized quite early that hydrogen (H2) is an important energy source in the near future [2]. Here, H2 has been recognized as alternative energy source due to: i) its high conversion efficiency, ii) negligible generation of pollutants on burning, and iii) high energy density [3–5]. Among the biological systems, quite a few taxonomically diverse organisms have been found to possess H2 metabolic pathways. Incidentally, very few novel H2 producers, namely Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus, Gloeocapsa alpicola, Rubrivivax gelatinosus and Thermotoga elfii have been reported in the last two decades [3,6–8]. Comparative genomics of the sequenced genomes has provided information on a few other novel H2 producers [9]. Biochemical studies have revealed that theoretically, a maximum of 12 mol of H2 can be produced from 1 mol of hexose [10]. With dark-fermentative process, this yield is restricted to 4 mol H2/mol of glucose (Eq. (1)), which if accompanied by acetate can be fermented further by photosynthetic process to yield an additional 8 mol/mol substrate (Eq. (2)) [3,11,12]. Dark-fermentation: (1) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 ( Glucose ) ( Acetate ) Photo-fermentation: (2) 2 CH 3 COOH + 4 H 2 O → 4 CO 2 + 8 H 2 ( Acetate ) Biological H2 production (BHP) occurs through a variety of biochemical routes under diverse physiological conditions [3,13]. Microalgae as potential H2 producers are well equipped with genetic, enzymatic, metabolic and electron transport machinery to generate energy (ATP) along with sustained H2 evolution [13]. Recent approaches for developing BHP processes have concentrated on optimization of physiological parameters, utilization of diverse substrates and engineering of metabolic pathways [14]. A search for the best strain of H2 producers or their combination is still on despite their availability in large numbers [3,14]. Each microbial strain has a limited ability to produce H2 under diverse environmental conditions. A better option is to complement H2 producing abilities of different strains and use them as mixed cultures or as a consortium, which may prove better than a single strain. Large quantities of waste biomass are present in the agricultural sector, food and fruit processing industries, etc. Utilization of the organic matter present in these wastes enables the realization of certain objectives, the primary being: i) generation of renewable energy and ii) waste minimization and stabilization leading to waste management and consequent pollution reduction [15,16]. BHP using renewable resources through anaerobic digestion is a promising possibility, which was realized almost two decades ago [17,18]. Quite a few reviews have concentrated on diverse mechanisms, which may be instrumental in producing H2 in an economical manner: (i) production processes [5,14,19–23], (ii) physiological factors [24–26], (iii) kinetic modeling [27,28], (iv) experimental designs [23,28,29], (v) genetic engineering [30,31], (vi) genomics and synthetic studies [3,9,32,33], (vii) integrative processes [12,14,34,35], (viii) bioreactor and process design [23,36], (ix) challenges and prospectives [15,37–41]. In spite of a large numbers of investigations and approaches, which have been carried out to improve the BHP, we still need: i) to combine dark and photosynthetic H2 producers, ii) to produce H2 from biowaste under unsterilized conditions and iii) to develop integrative approaches with other bioproducts for value addition. In the present review, we have evaluated the feasibility of complementing the metabolic abilities of dark- and photo-fermentative organisms for enhancing H2 yields. Here we will provide an account of the individual capacities followed by combined abilities of only those organisms which have been employed together for H2 production. All those studies involving undefined mixed cultures for dark- and/or photo-fermentative H2 production processes have not been discussed here."
1,Biological hydrogen production,"Biohydrogen is a key compound in the metabolism of many anaerobic as well as a few aerobic microorganisms. BHP depends mainly upon two enzymes: hydrogenase and nitrogenase. These enzymes catalyze the simple chemical reaction: 2H+ + 2e− ↔ H2 [3]. Among the various H2 production methods, fermentative BHP process is environment friendly and less energy intensive and can be exploited for achieving high efficiency [22]."
2,Dark-fermentation,"2.1 Dark-fermentation Dark-fermentative H2 production occurs under anoxic or anaerobic conditions (i.e., in the absence of O2 as an electron acceptor). The key pathway is the breakdown of carbohydrate rich substrates by bacteria to H2 and other intermediate products such as fatty acids and alcohols. These substrates have provided building blocks and metabolic energy for the bacterial growth [14]. BHP has been studied in a wide range of organisms belonging to diverse taxonomical groups such as Firmicutes, Thermotogales, α-Proteobacteria and γ-Proteobacteria (Table 1 ). The abilities to metabolize different substrates vary with organisms. The most frequently used feed has been glucose, where H2 yields (mol/mol hexose) with different organisms varied as follows: 2.85 by Ethanoligenens harbinense [42–44], 3.12 by Escherichia coli [45–48], up to 3.26 by Clostridium butyricum [47–52], between 0.78 and 2.8 by Clostridium beijerinckii [51,53–55], 1.0–2.4 with Clostridium pasteurianum [47,56], up to 3.8 by Thermotoga neapolitana [57–61], 2.5–3.6 by C. saccharolyticus [58,59,62–66], up to 3.8 by Enterobacter cloacae [45,67–69]. In contrast to E. cloacae, H2 yields with Enterobacter aerogenes were in the range of 0.68–2.23 mol/mol hexose [70–73]. In comparison to glucose, H2 yields (mol/mol substrate) have been relatively low with: (1) fructose (0.39–2.6) [46,53,58,67,73], (2) xylose (0.57–2.2) [46,53,60,62,67,74–76] and (3) sucrose (0.35–2.07) [46,53,76–78]. In exceptional cases, higher H2 yields in the range of 3.0–3.4 mol/mol of these substrates were reported [6,58,61,64,67]. Although many sugars and alcohols have been tried as feed for producing H2, the yields were quite low (Table 1) [46,53,67,73,79,80]. However, there have been reports of H2 yields in the range of 2.20–2.62 with galactose, mannose and mannitol as feed [56,73,81]. Starch proved to be moderately poor as substrate, which could be metabolized to yield 0.02–2.03 mol H2/mol hexose [52,53,82,83]. Cellulose is relatively difficult to utilize for H2 production, such that 2.2 mol/mol hexose could be evolved under energy intensive thermophilic conditions by T. neapolitana [84]. Similarly, H2 production by C. butyricum was quite low with α-cellulose and carboxymethyl-cellulose (CMcellulose) as feed, where it varied between 0.50 and 0.86 mol/mol hexose [85,86]. Dark-fermentative organisms have been shown to produce H2 from biowastes consisting of easily degradable organic matter (Table 2 ). Bagasse could be utilized as feed by C. butyricum, C. pasteurianum and C. saccharolyticus to produce 0.96–2.60 mol H2/mol hexose [66,87–90]. Molasses although rich in sugar content was found to evolve only 1.63–1.85 mol H2/mol hexose with C. butyricum [91,92], whereas E. aerogenes yielded up to 3.5 mol H2/mol hexose [93,94]. E. coli was also shown to generate H2 from molasses at the rate of 97.4 mmol/L/h [45]. With other wastes such as carrot pulp and potato steam peels, H2 yields were not influenced much by the bacterial inoculants [58,59]. Here, the most important component is the use of highly divergent bacteria, such as mesophilic C. butyricum (Firmicutes) and thermophilic T. neapolitana (Thermotogales) [52,95]. Among the rest of the biowastes (Table 2), wheat straw proved quite efficient with a yield of 3.7–3.8 mol/mol hexose, when inoculated with C. saccharolyticus [88]. In summary, a wide range of biowastes and bacteria can be exploited to obtain high yields up to 3.8 mol H2/mol hexose. Here, the different combinations involved C. butyricum, C. saccharolyticus, E. aerogenes and T. neapolitana as the notable bacterial component. These were used along with molasses [93,94], potato steam peels [59], maize, Napier grass, sweet sorghum, Silphium leaves and stalk, wheat straw, rice straw, cheese whey, starchy wastes [52,67,75,86,88,96–99], industrial effluents and waste waters as feed [54,62,100–103]. Whole plant such as Miscanthus proved effective to yield almost similar H2 quantities (3.2–3.4 mol/mol hexose) with two different bacteria [95]. Another emerging field is the biodiesel, where high chemical oxygen demand containing wastes are generated in large quantities. These have also been demonstrated to have the potential to act as feed for H2 production [80,104,105]. In spite of a wide range of options being available to utilize pure substrates for BHP with a diverse set of bacteria, the process is not economical primarily due to the high cost of the feed. Replacing substrates with biowaste materials is likely to enhance the economy of the process. Under dark-fermentative conditions, it is possible to achieve conversion efficiency of 87–95% of the maximum theoretical value with both mesophilic and thermophilic organisms using molasses, potato steam peels and wheat straw [59,88,94]. Feasibility of H2 production has been observed to be equally efficient under batch and continuous culture conditions [63,94]. Since most of the reports have been based on batch culture conditions and in small reactor volumes of up to 2 L over a period of 3–4 days of incubation, there is still a need to further optimize the strains, medium and culture conditions to achieve a reliable and sustainable BHP on a large scale."
3,Photo-fermentation,"2.2 Photo-fermentation In this process, fermentative microorganisms capture energy directly from sunlight to carry out anaerobic photosynthesis. Photosynthetic bacteria evolve molecular H2, which is catalyzed by nitrogenase under nitrogen-deficient conditions using light energy and reduced compounds (organic acids) [14]. Under anaerobic conditions, these bacteria use simple organic acids, like acetic acid as electron donors, which are transported to the nitrogenase by ferredoxin using ATP as an energy source. In the absence of nitrogen, nitrogenase enzyme can reduce protons into H2 gas [20]. The overall reaction of photo-fermentative H2 production is: C6H12O6 + 6H2O + light energy → 12H2 + 6CO2 [3]. Among the photosynthetic bacteria, Rhodobacter and Rhodopseudomonas spp. belonging to α-proteobacteria have been studied extensively for their H2 producing abilities (Table 3 ). Utilization of pure substrates as feed has been primarily limited to fatty acids [106–108]. Glucose and glycerol have also proved effective in certain cases [109–111]. Four species of photosynthetic organisms: Rhodobacter capsulatus, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Rhodopseudomonas faecalis and Rhodopseudomonas palustris have been shown to utilize fatty acids having 2–6 carbon atoms to produce H2. Here, H2 yields with acetate varied from 0.33 to 3.8 mol/mol substrate (Table 3). R. sphaeroides gave low yields in the range of 0.33–1.45 mol/mol acetate [108,112–114]. On the other hand, R. capsulatus, R. faecalis and R. palustris were quite effective, with a H2 yield of up to 3.8 mol/mol acetate [106,115–122]. The H2 production rate of 0.55 mmol/L/h with acetate was negatively influenced upon addition of lactate [123,124]. A comparison of different Rhodobacter spp. proved that R. capsulatus is quite suitable for metabolism of lactate, where 80 ml H2/L/h (4.46 mmol/L/h) was observed in comparison to 40 ml H2/L/h (up to 1.99 mol/mol lactate) produced by R. sphaeroides [125–127]. In contrast to Rhodobacter spp., the H2 yields with lactate were slightly lower (0.76–1.75 mol/mol lactate) than Rhodopseudomonas spp. [106,128]. In comparison to lactate, the H2 yields were relatively higher with malate and quite uniform among all the four photosynthetic organisms being reported here (Table 3) [106,112,113,128–137]. With carbohydrates like glucose, H2 yields were quite comparable in R. capsulatus and R. palustris, the values ranging between 0.66 and 3.60 mol/mol hexose [110,111,138–140]. On the contrary, R. sphaeroides proved much more effective as it produced 5.76–7.20 mol H2/mol glucose [140]. In addition to many substrates listed above, R. palustris proved to be a high H2 producer even with glycerol, where it produced 6.2 mol H2/mol substrate [109]. It may be concluded that R. palustris and R. sphaeroides are quite effective for photosynthetic BHP since they can metabolize a wide range of substrates, including butyrate to H2 [108,141] (Table 3). The ability to produce H2 by photosynthetic bacteria has also been observed from a wide range of biowastes originating from sugar industries, brewery, dairy and food processing units (Table 3). On the individual basis, R. capsulatus could evolve up to 3.12 mol H2/mol acetate with molasses as feed [142] and R. sphaeroides has been able to produce 1.23 mol H2/mol hexose of wheat starch [143] and 0.26 mol/mol hexose from sugar refinery effluent [144] (Table 3). A comparison of the H2 yielded by R. sphaeroides over a wide range of substrates revealed dairy waste water, primarily composed of sugars, to be the most effective with a yield of 3.62 L/L (3.66 mmol/L/h) in comparison to 2.24 L/L (2.72 mmol/L/h) from brewery waste water [145,146], and up to 13.9 L/L feed (0.4 mmol/L/h) from olive mill waste water [112,147–149]. A similar effect of different bacterial strains on H2 production from a common feed (potato steam peels) was observed to vary from 1.3 with R. palustris, 2.76–2.88 with R. capsulatus and 1.68–2.40 mol/mol hexose with R. sphaeroides [140]. A H2 yield of 2.84 mol/mol hexose [106] was obtained with R. faecalis on fermenting beef extract, which was almost similar to that recorded with R. capsulatus – potato steam peels combination. R. palustris proved equally effective on glycerol and its waste, which resulted in producing around 6 mol H2/mol substrate [109]. The need to select a combination of bacteria and waste for optimal H2 yields is emphasized by the wide variations in H2 producing abilities of the photosynthetic organisms, especially R. palustris which produces 0.38–93 mmol/L/h from waste water [121,150,151] and 0.44 mmol/L/h from palm oil mill effluents [152]. Another interesting feature of R. palustris is its ability to co-produce biofuels such as biomass, rich in oil content (41.4%) and H2 to the tune of 3.16 L from malate [153]. Theoretically H2 yields of 4 and 6 mol/mol of substrate can be achieved from fatty acids, such as acetate and malate, respectively. In practice, it has been possible to achieve 95% efficiency in case of R. palustris on acetate [115], and 77% in case of R. sphaeroides with malate [112]. In general, H2 yields with biowastes as feed for photo-fermentative bacteria have been quite low [106,140]. High conversion efficiency by photosynthetic organisms to produce H2 was recorded from biodiesel effluent in comparison to that obtained from pure substrate such as glycerol [109]. It may be remarked here that the H2 yields were generally higher under indoor conditions than outdoor photo-fermentative BHP with acetate and lactate [107,120,123,124]. However, with malate as feed, the yield under outdoor photo-fermentative conditions was the highest among all the reports [112] (Table 3). In addition to photosynthetic organisms and the substrates listed above for producing H2 through photo-fermentative routes, an equally important aspect is the reactor design. A detailed analysis was carried out by Gebicki et al., 2010 under the Integrated Framework Project (HYVOLUTION) of European Commission, which revealed that based on the illuminated surface area per unit ground area, panel reactor is a better performer than the tubular reactor [123]. However, the general opinion is that in comparison to dark-fermentative process reactors, photo-biological reactors still need attention."
4,Two stage dark- and photo-fermentative hydrogen production,"BHP by sequential operation of dark- and photo-fermentation is a promising route which may be used to overcome the problems of low H2 yields observed with either process [34,131,154,155]. Most of the works on combining dark- and photo-fermentation processes have been operating either as a single (combined) or two stages (sequential). Here, the focus has been on pure substrates as feed with yields in the range of 2.24–7.10 mol H2/mol hexose. Even with biowastes such as molasses [18], food waste and cassava starch [156] as feed, H2 yields have been quite comparable and encouraging. The individual capacities of photosynthetic bacteria ranges from 1.64 to 7.10 mol H2/mol hexose (Table 4 ), where the maximum recorded yields through dark-fermentative route were up to 3.8 mol H2/mol hexose [60]. A combination of these two processes is likely to exceed the 4.0 mol/mol glucose, which has been set as the practically achievable limit of the theoretical 12 mol/mol glucose [11]. Most studies exploiting dark-fermentative and photosynthetic routes in a sequential manner have shown H2 yields up to 7.1 mol/mol glucose as substrate [157]. A clear and dominant role of the R. sphaeroides as the photosynthetic partner was evident since H2 yields varied little from 5.0 to 7.1 mol/mol hexose with a range of dark-fermentative organisms such as C. butyricum, E. cloacae and Lactobacillus delbrueckii [157–159]. Another almost similar role of the photosynthetic partner was evident even with R. faecalis, which could yield 4.13–5.37 mol H2/mol hexose with C. butyricum [160–162] and 3.10–6.32 mol H2/mol hexose with E. harbinense [163,164] (Table 4). H2 yields by different photosynthetic partners along with C. butyricum as a common dark-fermentative partner, were found to vary between 1.64 and 5.48 mol H2/mol hexose [160–162,165–168]. It further supports the conclusion that R. sphaeroides can be combined with a wide range of dark-fermentative bacteria for enhancing H2 yields. The effects of changes in feed material were evident in H2 yields such that a shift from sucrose to fructose or xylose decreased them from 7.10 to 4.75 mol/mol fructose or to 3.60 mol/mol xylose [165,169]. H2 yield, with sucrose as substrate, were quite comparable in combinations of Clostridium acidisoli and R. sphaeroides or C. butyricum and R. palustris [165,170]. In contrast, combining a widely used H2 producer E. coli with R. sphaeroides, did not result in enhancing H2 yield [171](Table 1). With algal biomass as feed, H2 yield seems to be influenced more by the dark-fermentative partner rather than the photosynthetic organism. In the cases of combining R. sphaeroides with different dark-fermentative bacteria, H2 yields (mol/mol hexose) varied as: (i) 0.6 with Clostridium beijerinkii [172], 8.3 with C. butyricum [173] and (iii) up to 7.2 with a co-inoculation of C. butyricum and E. aerogenes [174,175]. Similarly, the influence of dark-fermentative partner on H2 yield was evident in the case of Rhodobium marinum, where H2 yield was 2.4 mol/mol hexose with Vibrio fluvialis [176] and 7.3 mol/mol hexose with L. delbrueckii [177]. Finally, a dominant role of photosynthetic partner was evident in combination of R. capsulatus along with C. saccharolyticus [18,75,95,178] and T. neapolitana [95,179]. Here, little variation in H2 yields (4.50–6.85 mol/mol hexose) was observed with a wide range of feed materials such as Miscanthus [95,179], potato steam peels [95,178] and molasses [18,95,178] (Table 4). H2 production by photo-fermentation on addition of malate to the effluent generated by dark-fermentation of cheese whey was found to increase up to 10 mol/mol lactose i.e. 5 mol/mol hexose [180]. Among the various parameters, BHP is influenced the most by changes in pH and temperature of incubation. For dark-fermentative BHP, pH in the range of 6.0–6.9 has been associated with glucose where it yields 3.4–3.8 mol H2/mol hexose [58,59,69]. In these cases, glucose concentration has been quite moderate in the range of 1–2% (w/v). High H2 yielding mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria operated in a narrow temperature range of 36–37 °C and 72–75 °C, respectively [58,59,69]. Though stirring seems necessary for BHP, there seems to be no clear cut correlation of H2 yield with the speed, which operates in 100–350 rpm in most studies. The operational parameters where dark-fermentative bacteria used biowastes to yield 3.4–3.5 mol H2/mol hexose were quite similar to those observed with glucose as feed [59,94,95]. In contrast to dark-fermentative BHP, photosynthetic bacteria seem to prefer a low incubation temperature of 30–35 °C. However, the pH of 6.4–7.1 is quite similar to that observed in dark-fermentative H2 producers [106,115,122,140]. Here, an obvious requirement is the light intensity. In most of the indoor studies on photosynthetic hydrogen production the light intensity used has been 4000–6600 lux (equivalent to approximately 80–132 μmol photons/m2/s) [106,122] or 95–150 W/m2 (equivalent to approximately 437–690 μmol photons/m2/s) [115,140]. This quantum of light irradiance is much lower than 2000 μmol photons/m2/s, which can be expected to be available under natural outdoor conditions, especially in the summer in some places near the equator [181]. In those studies, where feed is subjected to dark-fermentative bacteria followed by photosynthetic bacteria, the physiological and environmental parameters were quite similar to those observed in their respective stages [159,160,169]. A perusal of different two stage combinations reveals that efficiency of BHP can be further improved to those achievable in individual cases."
5,Integrative approach for enhancing process efficiency,"In spite of a large number of studies conducted so far, the process of BHP has been found to be uneconomical. It is primarily because this process cannot utilize more than 33% of the energy present in the biowaste [182]. It implies that production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and methane (energy) from the effluent of the previous stages is expected to improve the economics of the process [3,12,182]. The feasibility of an integrative approach for exploiting microbes for generating H2 and PHA gains support from studies, which have revealed certain photosynthetic (R. palustris, Rhodospirillum rubrum and R. sphaeroides) [183–186] and dark-fermentative bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Bacillus. thuringiensis) with abilities to produce both the bioproducts from pure substrates and biowastes [187–190]. More recently, combinations of defined and undefined set of bacteria have been used for each step [191–193]. An interesting component of these studies has been the use of pea-shells as feed, which can be easily converted to methane [194]."
6,Conclusion,"On the basis of either dark- or photo-fermentative H2 production process, it is possible to achieve 3.55–3.8 mol/mol glucose using non-photosynthetic bacteria such as Enterobacter, Caldicellulosiruptor and Thermotoga spp. In contrast, photosynthetic bacteria such as Rhodopseudomonas spp. have been shown to produce 3.55–3.63 mol H2/mol acetate. For enhancing the efficiency of BHP, it is desirable to have a combination of the two types of bacteria with waste biomass as feed. On the basis of available published reports, algal biomass rich in starch and molasses seems to be good candidates as feed. Among the bacterial components, (i) R. sphaeroides along with C. butyricum and E. aerogenes and (ii) R. marinum proved effective with a yield of 7.2–8.3 mol H2/mol hexose."
7,Opinion,"The availability of biowaste in bulk as feed is likely to vary from region to region. It will be desirable to use waste biomass rich in carbohydrates and low in nitrogen content because high nitrogen content negatively influence H2 yields [18,180]. Infact, high C:N ratio favors H2 fermentation [195]. This strategy will also prove helpful to PHA production, which operates efficiently on substrates with high C content and limited in nutrients such as nitrogen [196]. It will be thus important to exploit dark-fermentative bacteria such as Bacillus spp. in combination with other photosynthetic bacteria such as R. palustris, R. rubrum and R. sphaeroides, because of the associated advantage that bacteria from either group can produce both H2 and PHA [196]. In addition, Bacillus spp. have been generally regarded as safe. Its wide range of hydrolytic abilities will prove beneficial for solubilization of complex organic matter in the initial stages of waste degradation [3,187]. It will thus expand the range of possibilities of generating H2 locally and meeting the global energy demand."
