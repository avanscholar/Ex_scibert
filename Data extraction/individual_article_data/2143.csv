0,Introduction,"Dewatered sewage sludge (DSS) is a by-product of sewage treatment, and the large volumes of this by-product could easily lead to secondary environmental pollution. However, the high moisture content of DSS limits the effectiveness and efficiency of its treatment and disposal [1]. Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) technology can utilize the large amount of water in the sludge to convert the organic matter into fuel gas [2]. This technology for treatment of sludge as a resource has received increasing attention in recent years [3]. In previous studies on sewage sludge SCWG, researchers have focused on two aspects. The first aspect concerns improving the efficiency of resource utilization, and the second, ensuring that the products from SCWG of sludge are environmentally friendly because sludge contains toxic and hazardous pollutants. For the former, use of a catalyst can ensure efficient resource utilization and can also avoid increases in cost associated with changes in conditions. Nickel is the most widely used catalyst. Furusawa et al. [4] added a Ni/MgO catalyst to a lignin SCWG process, and found that the hydrogen yield increased and that the degradation of lignin was enhanced compared with SCWG without a catalyst. DiLeo and Savage [5] found that at 500–550°C, a Ni catalyst increased the degradation of methanol in SCWG by a considerable level. A number of studies [6,7] include similar experimental results for other substances. The catalytic mechanism of Ni was investigated [8,9] and the results showed that Ni can promote breaking of CC and CO bonds, thereby enhancing the degradation of reactants and hydrogen production. Conventionally, SCWG was mainly used for plant biomass, and a few researchers have reported on the environmental safety of the products. Sevgihan et al. [10] investigated the production of dioxins through hydrothermal gasification of animal manure, and found that the concentration of dioxins in the product was much lower than the level required by Japanese regulations. Ma et al. [11] analyzed heavy metals in SCWG products of DSS, and found that the heavy metal toxicity of leachant from the products was significantly reduced after SCWG treatment. In addition, Xu et al. [12] treated DSS by SCWG at 400°C and found that the PAH concentration increased from less than 500ng/g in raw sludge to about 1600ng/g in the solid products. Gong et al. [13] reported that the sludge organic matter (OM) content affected the ring-composition of PAHs, and that phenols were important PAH precursors. It can be concluded that SCWG treatment reduces the risk of dioxin and heavy metal contamination, but may increase PAH contamination. The addition of oxidants can effectively degrade organic pollutants during SCWG, and Goto et al. [14] found that addition of H2O2 to sewage sludge in SCWG resulted in complete conversion of the OM. O'Brien et al. [15] found the dichlorobiphenyl degradation rate reached 99.98% in SCWG of wastewater with H2O2 treatment. However, adding an oxidant to the reaction may cause other effects. Muangrat et al. [16] added H2O2 for the gasification of food waste and found that the hydrogen yield decreased as the amount of H2O2 increased. H2 is an important target product of SCWG in resource treatment technology. Therefore, the addition of an oxidant can effectively solve the problem of PAH formation and ensure the environmental safety of the products, but could also affect resource utilization, which is obviously not desirable. It is of interest to determine if efficient resource utilization and environmental safety can be achieved simultaneously. Although it has been pointed out that H2O2 will reduce the hydrogen yield, Guo et al. [17] suggested that this could be attributed to the large amount of H2O2. Conversely, addition of a lower amount of H2O2 could slightly increase the hydrogen yield compared with that obtained with a higher amount of H2O2. In addition, to the effective inhibition of PAHs formation obtained with an oxidant, Sinag et al. [18] reported that Ni could reduce the formation of phenols, which are the main precursors to PAHs. Consequently, Ni could also conceivably inhibit the formation of PAHs. Onwudili et al. [19] added a basic catalyst and H2O2 to SCWG of food waste, and found that the use of both a catalyst and oxidant promoted gasification by enhancing decarbonylation. In this study, H2 yield and the concentration of 16 US EPA priority controlled PAHs in products were measured to investigate the following key aspects during the SCWG of DSS with catalyst (Ni) and/or oxidant (H2O2): (1) the effect of an Ni/H2O2 additive mixture on hydrogen production and inhibition of PAH formation, (2) the effect of the Ni:H2O2 ratio on the reaction, (3) the mechanism of action of the Ni/H2O2 additive mixture, and (4) the roles of the catalyst and oxidant in the additive mixture."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials DSS was obtained from a wastewater treatment plant in Nanjing, China. The basic properties of the DSS are shown in Table 1 . The Ni catalyst was reduced nickel powder (99.5% purity, particle size 5mm) purchased from Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd., and 30% H2O2 (analytical reagent grade), purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd."
3,Experimental apparatus and procedure,"2.2 Experimental apparatus and procedure The SCWG of DSS was performed in a 316L stainless steel batch reactor purchased from the Songling Chemical Instrument Co. (Yantai, China). The reactor was described in detail in an earlier study [2]. Before the experiment, H2O2 (10% mass fraction) was added to the reactor, which was maintained at 500°C for 2h to fully oxidize the reactor wall to prevent it from participating in the catalysis reaction. The reaction pressure displayed on the pressure gauge depended on the reaction temperature and the DSS loading in the reactor, which was not adjusted manually. The reactor pressure was above 22.1MPa at 400°C with 33mL of water in the reactor, which indicated that the water reached supercritical conditions at this temperature. During the experiment, 40g of DSS containing about 33mL of water and the required additives were added to the reactor. After the temperature reached 400°C and the pressure gauge reached 22.1MPa, the reaction was maintained for 60min. Then, the reactor was removed from the salt bath furnace and rapidly cooled to room temperature under a fan. After the reactor had cooled, gas from the reactor was collected using a 20mL syringe and submitted for analysis. The generated gas volume was then measured using displacement of a saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution. Methods for the collection and separation of solid and liquid products have been described elsewhere [20]."
4,Product analysis,"2.3 Product analysis The composition of the gas was determined using a gas chromatograph (GC5890, Kejie Analytical Instrument Co. Ltd., Nanjing, China) with a thermal conductivity detector (TDX-01 packed column) and a flame ionization detector (PLOT Al2O3/S column). The PAH composition was determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GCMS-QP2010 Plus, Shimadzu, Japan) with a HP-5MS column (30m×0.32mm id, 0.25μm film thickness) using high-purity helium as the carrier gas. Mass spectrometry was performed in selected ion monitoring mode. The inlet temperature was 280°C, the injection volume was 1.0μL, and the injection was splitless with an injection time of 1min. The total flow rate of the carrier gas was 30.0mL/min, and the column flow rate was 3.0mL/min. The ion source temperature was 250°C and the interface temperature was 300°C. The column temperature was initially held at 100°C for 2min, increased to 240°C at a rate of 15°C/min and held for 2min; then increased to 265°C at a rate of 3°C/min. Finally, it was increased to 300°C at a rate of 20°C/min and held at this temperature for 6min. A five-point calibration curve was constructed for quantitation of the PAHs, and the 16 target PAHs were classified based on their ring numbers, including 2-ring to 6-ring PAHs. The total organic carbon (TOC) content was measured using a TOC meter (TOC-V CPN, Shimadzu, Japan). The phenolic content was measured using the 4-aminoantipyrine spectrophotometric method with an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (UV2450, Shimazu, Japan). Infrared spectra were measured using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ALPHA, Bruker, Germany)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,The recovery rate of product after the SCWG,"3.1 The recovery rate of product after the SCWG The recovery rate of the products are listed in Table 2 . The experiments in this study had recovery rate of products in the range of 83.2%–98.9%. According to our previous work, because PAHs have low solubility in water, their octanol-water partition coefficients are large. This means that more than 95% of the PAHs will be found in solid phase residues [13]. The solid residue mass and total PAH amount are also listed in Table 2, which have obvious differences under different amount of Ni and H2O2 addition."
7,Effects of separate Ni or H2O2 on SCWG of DSS,"3.2 Effects of separate Ni or H2O2 on SCWG of DSS At 400°C, the Ni catalyst (2, 4, 6, 8, or 10wt% of DSS) was added to 40g of DSS, and the hydrogen yield was measured (Fig. 1 (a)). Besides, the PAH concentrations (Fig. 1(b)) and total PAH amount (Table 2) in the solid phase products were determined. The hydrogen yield increased with the addition of Ni catalyst, and the hydrogen yield obtained with 2wt% Ni was twice that obtained without the catalyst (Fig. 1a). The hydrogen yield increased from an initial 0.29mol/kg OM to 1.05mol/kg OM when 10wt% Ni was added. Gong et al. [21] reported that the hydrogen yield from SCWG of DSS obtained with 5wt% Ni was three times that obtained without the catalyst. In the present study, the hydrogen yield obtained under Ni catalysis was slightly lower than that found in other studies. Gong et al. [2] reported that the hydrogen yields for SCWG of 10 types of DSS produced by different sewage plants were affected by the type of DSS, and that the maximum difference in yield obtained with and without the catalyst was four to five times. Therefore, the lower yield observed in the present study could be the result of the DSS source. Ni had a limited effect on inhibition of PAH formation (Fig. 1(b)). The PAH concentration decreased from 1.57 to 1.13μg/g and total amount of PAH decreased from 11.1 to 7.7μg with Ni increase from 0 to 10wt%, a reduction of about 28% and 31% respectively. For the four, five, and six ring PAHs, which have higher toxicity than other PAHs, almost no reduction in formation was observed with Ni addition. However, for the two and three ring PAHs, as the mass fraction of Ni increased, the formation of these PAHs gradually decreased. When H2O2 (2, 4, 6, 8, or 10wt% of DSS) was added to the reactor with 40g of DSS, we measured changes in the hydrogen yield, concentrations and composition of PAHs in the solid residues (Fig. 2 ), and total amount of PAH (Table 2). As the mass fraction of H2O2 increased, the hydrogen yield increased slightly at first and then decreased sharply (Fig. 2(a)). With H2O2 mass fraction of 10wt%, there was almost no hydrogen present. Addition of H2O2 effectively reduced the total concentration of the PAHs (Fig. 2(b)). As the mass fraction of H2O2 increased, the total concentration of PAHs decreased gradually. With a H2O2 mass fraction of 10wt%, the PAH concentration was 0.56μg/g, a decrease of 64% from that for the reaction with no H2O2 (1.57μg/g). Besides, the solid residue mass also decrease with H2O2 amount increase, which cause the total amount of PAH decrease from 11.1μg to 2.2μg with H2O2 amount increase from 0 to 8wt% (Table 2). In addition, as the mass fraction of H2O2 increased, the proportion of high molecular weight PAHs decreased gradually."
8,Effects of combined H2O2 and Ni on SCWG of DSS,"3.3 Effects of combined H2O2 and Ni on SCWG of DSS To investigate how simultaneous addition of Ni and H2O2 affected the hydrogen yield and inhibition of PAH formation, they were both added to the reactor at 400°C with 40g of DSS. Hydrogen yields were measured for reactions carried out without additive, with only 5wt% Ni, with only 5wt% H2O2, or with 2.5wt% Ni and 2.5wt% H2O2 (Fig. 3 ). The catalytic effect with the Ni/H2O2 additive mixture was good even though the Ni mass fraction was only 2.5wt% Ni. The hydrogen yield increased from 0.29mol/kg OM without additive, and to 0.83mol/kg OM with the Ni/H2O2 additive mixture. This was similar to the hydrogen yield (0.80mol/kg OM) obtained with 5wt% Ni. The best inhibition of PAH formation was obtained with the Ni/H2O2 additive mixture, and the total PAH concentration decreased from 1.27μg/g without additive to 0.66μg/g with the Ni/H2O2 additive mixture."
9,Effects of the Ni:H2O2 ratio on SCWG of DSS,"3.4 Effects of the Ni:H2O2 ratio on SCWG of DSS The additive mixture was effective in catalysis of hydrogen production and inhibition of PAH formation with a Ni:H2O2 ratio of 1:1. Next, we investigated if the Ni to H2O2 ratio in the additive mixture affected the results. The hydrogen yields were determined with an additive mixture containing x wt% H2O2 (where x =0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10) and 5wt% Ni. We first assumed that the catalytic effects of H2O2 and Ni were independent. When they were added in different proportion, the calculated value of hydrogen production for the mixture was assumed to be the sum of the results from H2O2 and Ni catalyzed separately. calculated value=HYx%h2o2 +HY5%Ni HYx%h2o2: the hydrogen yield with x wt% H2O2 HY5%Ni: the hydrogen yield with 5wt% Ni There were large differences (21%–35%) between the theoretical values and experimental data (Fig. 4 ), indicating that Ni and H2O2 have a synergistic effect on the reaction. The magnitude of the difference between the theoretical values and experimental data first increased and then decreased, which indicated that the ratio of Ni:H2O2 also affected the reaction. To investigate this further, 40g of DSS was added to the reactor at 400°C with a total additive mass fraction of 5wt%. Five different ratios of Ni:H2O2 were investigated. The hydrogen yield (Fig. 5 (a)) and PAH concentration (Fig. 5(b)) were measured. Although the mass fraction of Ni in these experiments was less than 5wt%, the hydrogen yield obtained with a Ni:H2O2 ratio greater than 1:1 was larger than 0.80mol/kg OM (obtained with 5wt% Ni). In addition, when the Ni:H2O2 ratio was <1, the hydrogen yield did not decrease significantly as the Ni mass fraction decreased. Although the mixing ratio could affect the hydrogen yield, the PAH concentration was almost the same for all five mixing ratios. However, the mixing ratio did affect the PAH composition. The proportion of rings of higher number (4–6 rings) PAHs increased from 13% to 44% with Ni/H2O2 increase from 1/3 to 3. When the Ni mass fraction was relatively large, the high molecular weight PAHs with six rings were observed. When the proportion of H2O2 was relatively large, high molecular weight PAHs did not form, but the concentration of low molecular weight PAHs increased."
10,Mechanism of the additive mixture,"3.5 Mechanism of the additive mixture For hydrogen production, according to Xu et al. [22], the oxidant equivalent ratio (OER), which is equal to the amount of oxidant added divided by the amount required for complete oxidation, will affect the hydrogen yield considerably. In the case of an excess of oxidant (OER >1), H2 and CO will be fully oxidized to H2O and CO2, which decreases the hydrogen yield as shown in Reaction (1): (1) OM+O2 →CO2 +H2O However, with less oxidant (OER <1), hydrocarbon gas will generate CO because of incomplete oxidation, and the produced CO will promote a shift in the water-gas reaction to improve hydrogen production, as shown below in Reactions (2) and (3): (2) C2 light gas+O2 →CO+CO2 +CH4 +H2 +H2O (3) CO+H2O→CO2 +H2 Similar conclusions have been reached from our experimental data and in several other studies [17,23], suggesting that the hydrogen yield can be enhanced by adding a small amount of oxidant. Ni can promote the water-gas shift reaction together with H2O2 [24]. With Ni, the yield of CO2 is higher than without Ni (Fig. 3). In addition, Gong et al. [25] showed that the opening reaction of the benzene ring occurred first during the supercritical water oxidation of quinazoline, followed by the formation of a series of intermediates and further degradation of the intermediates. In the SCWG process, high molecular weight OM will first break down into low molecular weight OM, and the low molecular weight OM will further gasify to produce hydrogen. Guo et al. [26] showed that hydrogen was mainly derived from the reforming reaction of small intermediates in the process of SCWG of glycerol. Lignin and other aromatic compounds are more difficult to gasify compared with other materials. Su et al. [27] used phenol as a model of lignin to study the reaction path, and highlighted that lignin decomposed into small molecule acids and alcohols by hydrolysis and alkylation. These small molecules then underwent rapid gasification. At 400°C, the reaction was carried out with the addition of 5wt% H2O2 or no H2O2. After gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, the products were classified as linear organic compounds and cyclic organic compounds (Table 3 ). When no oxidant was added, the product contained many cyclic compounds, with these compounds and their derivatives accounting for 54% of all the compounds. When the oxidant was added, the products were mainly linear compounds such as nitroethanol, glycine, and acetylacetone. The linear compounds accounted for 83% of all the compounds, and the proportion of cyclic compounds was reduced considerably compared to the case with no oxidant. Therefore, high molecular weight OM, which can be difficult to gasify, will decompose to intermediates quickly and increase the gasification efficiency. The H2O2 in the additive mixture can promote the ring opening of cyclic compounds to form a series of low molecular weight linear compounds. Further gasification of these intermediates occurs efficiently under Ni catalysis. On the other hand, Ni can also inhibit PAH formation. The total concentration of phenols in the liquid residue decreased as the mass fraction of Ni increased (Fig. 6 (a)). The Fourier transform infrared spectrum of the solid product (Fig. 7 ) showed a broad and strong peak at 3300cm−1, which is characteristic of phenol [28]. This peak decreased as the mass fraction of Ni increased, indicating that the formation of phenols gradually decreased. This shows that the Ni catalyst can effectively reduce the production of phenols, which are important precursors of PAHs [29]. Conversely, although H2O2 can promote the ring opening of high molecular weight PAHs to form intermediates, only some of these intermediates will be further gasified to synthesis gas, and the remaining large fraction of intermediates will regenerate PAHs via a polymerization reaction. Zhu et al. [30] reported that a Ru catalyst increased the gasification of phenols and furans considerably, and thus inhibited the polymerization of glucose in the catalytic gasification of glucose. Ni can promote the steam reforming reaction [31]. Therefore, Ni in the additive mixture can effectively enhance the gasification of the intermediates as soon as possible, which will reduce regeneration of the PAHs via polymerization. As the mass fraction of Ni increased, the TOC content in the solid and liquid residues decreased gradually (Fig. 6(b)). This indicates that the OM can be completely converted under the catalysis of Ni."
11,Conclusions,"The effects of the Ni/H2O2 additive mixture on hydrogen production and inhibition of PAH formation of SCWG of DSS were investigated for the first time. When using Ni as a single additive, it can increase the hydrogen yield and inhibit the production of low molecular weight PAHs. Use of H2O2 at a mass fraction less than 2wt% slightly improves the hydrogen yield and can inhibit the formation of PAHs. The Ni/H2O2 additive mixture enhances hydrogen production and inhibition of PAH formation considerably compared with either single additive. The Ni:H2O2 ratio affects the hydrogen yield and composition of PAH ring number: the proportion of 4–6 ring-PAHs increased from 13% to 44% with increasing Ni:H2O2 ratio. The mechanism of action for the Ni/H2O2 additive mixture on hydrogen production involves the two components working together to promote the water-gas shift reaction and gasification of high molecular weight OM that are otherwise difficult to gasify. For inhibition of PAH formation, Ni can inhibit the production of phenols and promote the gasification of intermediates to avoid re-polymerization to form new PAHs."
