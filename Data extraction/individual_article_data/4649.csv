0,Introduction,"The synthesis of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and their use in various applications has been one of the major growth areas of materials chemistry in the last few years [1]. CNTs have been used to make new catalysts, materials and devices [2]. A range of methodologies are available to make CNTs. The chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method is one of the methods of synthesis that has been used with success for the production of large quantities of single-walled and multi-walled CNTs [3]. The carbon sources used to produce the carbon materials are typically organic solvents such as alkanes, alkenes, aromatics and alcohols [4]. A catalyst is required to produce CNTs and typically this is a transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni) or a bimetallic material (Fe/Co, Fe/Mo, Fe/Ni, etc.) [5]. The CVD process either involves decomposition of the carbon source over a stationary supported catalyst or reaction/decomposition of both the carbon source and a volatile metal catalyst (called a “floating catalyst”) in the reactor [6]. When using a floating catalyst, a catalyst precursor (e.g. ferrocene or iron pentacarbonyl) can be dissolved in a solvent which also serves as a carbon source. The solution is then passed into a high temperature furnace using an inert carrier gas such as argon [7]. The success of this method depends on the production of sufficiently small droplets of the solution to provide small catalyst particles that will favour the formation of carbon nanotubes. This method has been used successfully to produce both SW (single-walled) and MW (multi-walled) CNTs using a range of solvents, catalysts and synthesis conditions [8]. The limitations of the use of this method include the poor solubility of some catalyst precursors in the solvents. As may be expected, the quality and purity of the products formed depends, to a large extent, on the choice of both solvent and catalyst. The solvents most studied are alkanes and aromatics [9]. Solvents such as alcohols, aldehydes and ketones have also been used as carbon sources in carbon nanotube synthesis using the chemical vapour deposition method [10]. Alcohols, in particular, have been found to produce cleaner carbon nanotubes which contain less amorphous carbon and other impurities. A summary of the methods that have been used to produce carbon nanotubes from alcohols as well as the results obtained is given in Table 1 [11–34]. As seen from the results (Table 1), reactions involving alcohols typically take place between 600 and 1000°C over a supported catalyst. The products produced are either amorphous carbon or carbon nanotubes. In summary, the studies performed to date reveal a positive influence of alcohols, in particular ethanol, in CNT synthesis. Further, high concentrations of the alcohol do not appear to be detrimental to CNT synthesis. Nebulised spray pyrolysis is a variation of the CVD method in which ultra-high frequency radiation is used to nebulise reactants to produce a reactant “mist” which is then carried into a high temperature furnace by a suitable carrier gas. This is achieved by placing the reaction mixture in a vessel at the base of which sits a piezo-electric transducer connected to a frequency generator. This method has been used in the production of large quantities of aligned MWCNTs. The lengths can be in excess of 1mm when benzene and xylene are used as the carbon source and ferrocene as the catalyst precursor [35]. In this study, we have thus investigated the effect of using ultra-high frequency radiation on the production of CNTs from toluene–alcohol mixtures as the carbon source. Ethanol, 2-propanol and octanol in toluene together with ferrocene were used to investigate the effects of alcohols on the yield and quality of the carbon nanotubes produced from the reactant mixture. From the data listed in Table 1, high yields of CNTs were expected. After this manuscript was submitted for publication a similar study [32] was brought to the attention of the authors by a referee. The results contained in our study complement and generally support the conclusions drawn from the earlier study."
1,Experimental,"The carbon nanotubes were prepared by the nebulised spray pyrolysis of a solution containing 2.00g of ferrocene, a desired amount of alcohol (0–1.00cm3) and enough toluene to make 50.0cm3 of solution. A Dr Hielscher UM20-1.6MHz nebuliser and frequency controller were used to produce the “mist” which was carried into a furnace (Elite TSH 12/500-2216) set to 900°C using argon as the carrier gas. An argon flow rate of 500sccm was maintained using a mass flow controller (Seven Star D07). In some reactions a mixture of argon and hydrogen (400sccm and 100sccm, respectively) were used as carrier gas. The reactants were passed through a quartz tube (70cm in length and 40mm in diameter) placed horizontally in a high temperature oven. All experiments were conducted at atmospheric pressure. Ferrocene (>98%), toluene (anhydrous, 99.8%), ethanol (absolute, 99.9%), 2-propanol (99%) and octanol (99.5%) were all obtained from Sigma–Aldrich and used without further purification. A synthesis time of 45min was used for all experiments and the nanotubes were collected from the quartz tube after the reactor was cooled down to room temperature under argon. A schematic representation of the equipment used is given in the Supplementary information. A sample that contained only ferrocene and toluene was used as a standard to evaluate the effect of alcohols on CNT formation. It is well established that carbon nanotubes obtained in this manner vary in their properties depending on the exact location of the deposition of the CNTs in the furnace. The carbon nanotubes were formed mainly in an area located 30cm from the inlet end of the quartz tube. For this reason, care was taken to collect only the products formed in a 2cm-wide area of the high temperature zone of the furnace for characterization. The rest of the product, which contained mainly shorter carbon nanotubes with a lower degree of alignment, was only used to establish the total mass obtained. The recovered carbon nanotube samples were not purified and were analyzed as prepared. A small quantity of the product was sonicated in methanol for 10min after which the resulting suspension was dropped onto a holey carbon grid. The samples were viewed at 80KeV using a JEOL 100 transmission electron microscope. For diameter measurements, four images were taken randomly at different spots on the TEM grid and the diameters of the carbon nanotubes (≈80–200 measured per sample) were measured using Coreldraw software. These measurements were used to obtain the diameter histograms reported. All SEM images were recorded at 15kV using a JEOL 5600 scanning electron microscope. TGA measurements were carried out in air using a Perkin–Elmer Pyris 1 Thermogravimetric Analyzer. The temperature was increased from 50 to 850°C at a rate of 10°C/min. Sample masses of 0.015–0.020g were used. Laser-Raman spectra were recorded using the micro-Raman attachment of a Jobin-Yvon T64000 Raman spectrometer, configured in triple subtractive spectrograph mode. The laser spot size on the sample was ≈5μm in diameter and the excitation wavelength used was 514.5nm (obtained from an argon ion laser). The dispersion configuration gave a bandpass of 2.8cm−1. Calibration was effected via the plasma line of the argon laser and these lines were removed from the sample spectra by means of a suitable narrow bandpass interference filter. A Gatan energy filter on the Philips CM200 was used."
2,Results and discussion,"A standard run, with only ferrocene (2.000g) in toluene (50cm3) and no alcohol present, yielded a product mass of 1.85±0.05g from repeat syntheses. TEM and HRTEM studies showed the product was comprised predominantly of carbon nanotubes as well as small quantities of iron particles and amorphous carbon. A typical TEM image is shown in Fig. 1 . The nanotubes are well graphitized with few visible defects in the inner layers although a typical covering of the tubes by amorphous carbon can be seen at high magnification (Fig. 2 ). The outer CNT diameters varied from 25 to more than 200nm with an average of 92nm. The inner diameters were typically 20±10nm. A reaction was performed in which argon was passed over the ferrocene (solid, placed at the front end of quartz reactor tube) in the absence of any external carbon source. A very small amount of carbonaceous material, as expected, was formed as the ferrocene sublimed and passed through the reactor. In other blank reactions, passage of toluene or toluene/ethanol mixtures through the reactor in the absence of ferrocene, led to carbon sphere formation and no CNT formation. The sphere concentration decreased as the ethanol concentration increased. Addition of ethanol to the toluene in the presence of ferrocene revealed that the yield of product decreased as the ethanol content increased from 0% to 2% (Table 2 ). The use of ethanol with no toluene in the reaction mixture produced no product at all. The effect of 2-propanol and octanol on the yield was also investigated. Table 2 shows that as was the case with ethanol, the carbon product yield is reduced by the presence of 2-propanol and octanol. The SEM images of the carbon nanotubes were recorded. The CNTs show good alignment with the nanotube growth perpendicular to the quartz substrate surface and CNT lengths are uniform. A typical SEM image (from 2% EtOH in toluene/ferrocene) is shown in Fig. 3 . The effect of ethanol on the carbon nanotube diameters is shown graphically in the diameter histograms in Fig. 4a–d . In the absence of ethanol, the diameter histogram (Fig. 4a) shows a wide distribution of diameters. A narrowing of the average outer diameters as the ethanol concentration increases is evident. No change was observed in the inner CNT diameters. A comparison of the standard sample (92nm) and a 0.1% ethanol in toluene reactant mixture (90nm) shows that the diameters remain more or less unchanged. The higher ethanol concentrations show a significant reduction of the average CNT diameters to 68 and 44nm for the 0.20% and 2.0% samples, respectively. Fig. 5 shows that a similar reduction in the CNT outer diameters was observed for the 2% 2-propanol and octanol samples. This reduction in the CNT diameter could be due to either oxidation of the outer walls of the CNTs or oxidation of the Fe catalyst in the presence of ethanol. Table 3 was constructed from an analysis of the SEM images for the 2% alcohol samples and shows a reduction in carbon nanotube length (as well as the calculated average growth rate) in the presence of alcohols. As shown in Table 3, the CNT length and growth rate generally increases with increasing yield. The effect of the alcohols is therefore to reduce the CNT length and growth rate. Our results are to be contrasted with those of Botello-Mendez et al. [32]. In Ref. [32] it was noted that an increase in CNT length occurred at very low ethanol additions (typically <2%). We did not observe this phenomenon. Since our experimental parameters differed from those of Bottelo-Mendez et al. (temperature, flow rates, catalyst concentration) it is clear that small changes to the parameters can lead to significant changes in the CNT lengths. The implication is that careful control of the experimental parameters is needed in CNT studies involving ethanol. The 2% octanol sample shows a CNT length of ∼1000nm, a value that approaches the value measured for the standard sample. This is in agreement with the diameter data in Fig. 5 where octanol was found to have the least effect when compared to ethanol and 2-propanol. Fig. 6 shows the Raman spectra of the CNT samples prepared from the 2% alcohol-containing samples. For all the samples, the location of the D- and G-peaks remains unchanged at 1358 (±2cm−1) and 1585 (±2cm−1), respectively. It is clear from these spectra as well as the data in Table 4 that the sample prepared without any alcohol had a larger I G/I D ratio than any of the samples prepared in the presence of alcohols. The ratio is reduced from 2.50 to 0.64 for 2.0% ethanol while the corresponding values for 2.0% 2-propanol and 2.0 octanol are 0.75 and 1.50, respectively. The CNTs produced from alcohol-containing solution samples are therefore confirmed to be less graphitic and contain higher proportions of non-sp2 hybridized carbon. The TGA profiles of the 2% samples are shown in Fig. 7 . The profiles confirm that the octanol sample is the one that most closely resembles the standard sample in terms of its oxidation properties while the ethanol and 2-propanol samples are more easily oxidized. This is in good agreement with SEM, TEM and Laser-Raman data and confirms the defective nature of the CNTs produced from ethanol-containing reaction mixtures. Although absolute ethanol was used in the experiments, the possible effect of small amounts of water on the reaction products could not be discounted. Indeed there is literature precedence that indicates that small amounts of water can impact on CNT purity [36]. The effect of water in an ethanol–toluene reaction mixture was thus investigated by including small quantities of water (0.05–0.20ml) in a 0.5ml ethanol in 50ml toluene reaction mixture. The effect on the reaction yield is shown in Table 5 . The data in Table 5 shows that the presence of water in the reaction mixture causes a reduction in the product yield. It is evident though from Table 5 that the concentration of water required to effect a 40% reduction in the CNT yield from a ethanol–toluene solution far exceeds the amount of water that would be contained in an undried ethanol–toluene solution. The observed reduction in the CNT yield can therefore only partially (if at all) be explained by the presence of water. These results suggest that the alcohol OH group is responsible for the reduced CNT yield. This would explain why octanol, which contains ∼13% OH by mass (compared to ∼37% and ∼28% for ethanol and 2-propanol, respectively), shows the least effect when compared to ethanol and 2-propanol. The use of ethanol to produce SWCNTs has been convincingly reported in the literature (see Table 1) and this has been explained in terms of surface oxidation reactions of the CNTs. Most of these studies have been performed under conditions quite different to those reported in this study and that of Bottelo-Mendez et al. [32]. In particular, the use of the sonication procedure in these latter two studies appears to have modified the products produced in the CVD process. The explanation for this change must relate to either the modification of the catalyst or to the carbon building blocks. The study by Bottelo-Mendez suggests that the iron catalyst is not oxidized (to FeO x ) by low concentrations of the ethanol; although this could be a significant reaction at high ethanol concentrations. This suggests that the presence of new gas phase species generated in the sonicator is implicated in the reaction. This is further suggested by our own studies with mixed argon/hydrogen carrier gas mixtures. As the hydrogen content of the carrier gas increased, no significant increase in the CNT yield was observed. This suggests that the oxidation of iron by ethanol is not a key factor in the reaction. It is well known that the sonication of water, alcohols and hydrocarbons initiates reactions in which various radicals are produced and that this results in the formation of a wide range of products. The sonication of water, for example, results in the formation of hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals which react further to produce molecular hydrogen and oxygen. Tauber et al. [37] confirmed that when aqueous solutions of tert-butanol were exposed to ultrasound irradiation (321kHz), the hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals from water attack the alcohol molecules and produce products including ethane, methane, 2,5-dimethylhexane-2.5-diol, ethylene, acetylene, propane, propene, isobutene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, acetate, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Furthermore, Mizukoshi et al. [38] also showed that reactions initiated by the sonication of alcohols produced (via radical formation) hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, ethane, ethyne, propane and some aldehydes. A GC–MS analysis was conducted to determine the gas phase chemical composition of the reactant gases in the CNT production process. Two samples involving ethanol were collected and analyzed by GC–MS. The first was a sample of evaporated ethanol while the second was a sample of the “mist” resulting from the nebulisation of ethanol by ultrasonic irradiation (as used for the carbon nanotube synthesis). The chromatogram of the gas phase from the nebulised ethanol reaction shows the presence of a species with a molecular ion that is not present in the evaporated sample. The mass spectrum corresponding to this molecular ion shows two major fragments with masses of 39 and 158g/mol (Fig. 8 ). The first indicates the presence of C3H3 fragments while the second is most probably an oligomer of C+O+H with a maximum of 13 carbon atoms. This confirms that the chemical composition of ethanol is altered by exposure to ultra-high frequency irradiation and that substances other than those produced from ethanol vapour are present after exposure to the nebuliser. These could lead to the production of oils, amorphous carbon or gaseous products which would explain the reduced CNT yield. The inclusion of ethanol and 2-propanol in the reaction mixture had a larger effect on the CNT yield, growth rate and graphitization than octanol. The larger octanol molecule contains less OH as a molar percentage of the molecule compared to ethanol and 2-propanol. The results reported above suggest that the CNT yield, diameters and % graphitization as well as the thermal stability are all affected negatively by the presence of alcohols in the reaction mixture. This is possibly as a result of the production of radicals by the sonication of alcohols whose presence in the reaction mixture hinders the growth of CNTs. Indeed the small positive effects that were noted in Ref. [32] at low ethanol concentrations could relate to the relative concentrations of gas phase species produced under the different reaction conditions. Our own further experiments to isolate or identify the gas phase species have to date not been successful. The best approach here would be to analyse the species in situ in the reactor."
3,Conclusions,"The sonication results presented above show that a general reduction in the yield, length, outer CNT diameter as well as the extent of graphitization of CNTs occurs in the presence of alcohols. The CNTs obtained when alcohols are used as the carbon source in classical CVD synthesis show that the mere presence of the OH group does not inhibit CNT formation. Further, the presence of water does not account for the reduction in the yield, diameters as well as the I G/I D ratios observed. The negative effects of alcohols on CNT synthesis observed in this study is most likely due to the action of ultrasonic irradiation on the alcohols leading to the production of radicals. These radicals react further to produce “reactants” that inhibit CNT growth. The results of the GC–MS analysis carried out in this work confirm that the chemical composition of the reaction mixture is indeed altered by exposure to sonication. The actual products formed on sonication require further study."
