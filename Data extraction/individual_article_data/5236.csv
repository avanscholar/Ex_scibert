0,Introduction,"Plastics play important roles on general areas related to human activities, especially to the food sector, since this class of material is responsible for contain and protect the most food which are consumed and distributed all over the world. The Plastics Europe (EPRO, PlasticsEurope, 2017) reported that 335 million tonnes of plastic materials were produced in 2016, and 39.9% of this production was designated to the packaging sector. The daily need of food consumption, and therefore, of plastic materials, brought up a demand of researches related to biodegradable packaging in order to replace materials that accumulate for a long time in the environment. Besides that, there is a current trend of gradual withdrawal of non-biodegradable plastics from the composition of disposable plates, cups, trays and cutlery, with their replacement by biodegradable materials, in order to decrease this accumulation. Countries such as France, Costa Rica and, recently Brazil, has already decided to accomplish the fully replacement until 2020, 2021 and 2028, respectively, corroborating an expected growth in biodegradable polymers demand. According to Cazón, Velazquez, Ramírez, and Vázquez, (2017), is desirable that biodegradable polymers used to produce packaging be abundant and low-cost, and thus, biopolymers with residue origin, such as whey protein isolate, are suitable to this requests. According to Tavares and Malcata (2016), in cheese production, 85% of the milk is converted in whey, which is a rich by-product that most cheese producers do not have proper treatment systems for dealing with. Still in 2016, only 50% of world cheese whey was treated instead of being discarded (Tavares & Malcata, 2016). As whey contains around 20% of the milk proteins, the use of these proteins to produce biodegradable films for packaging is an appropriate alternative for the whey exploiting. Whey protein isolate (WPI) is an edible and biodegradable biopolymer, which can be obtained from the whey generated by cheese industries, and can be used as polymeric matrix for packaging film forming (Azevedo et al., 2017; Cinelli et al., 2016; Coltelli et al., 2016; Hammann and Schmid, 2014; Schmid, 2013; Zink et al., 2016). WPI based films present desirable properties of transparency and good oxygen barrier, since the film forming includes the proteins heating, inducing their denaturation above 50 °C, and thus proteins become insoluble and aggregated. However, these films are commonly brittle, due to the interactions among the different functional groups in protein chains, such as sulfhydryl, amino and carboxylic acid groups exposed during the film forming, producing a more rigid structure (Schmid, 2013). Furthermore, the high affinity to water provided by polar groups makes solubility in water and water vapor transmission more likely in these films. Due to the proteins denaturation, interactions among their chains and with water molecules are increased. In addition, this denaturation also makes possible interactions among these proteins and other polymers, which can be added to the WPI for blends forming. In order to obtain barrier and mechanical properties which are applicable for food packaging, or even to produce active food packaging, blends and composites with WPI has been evaluated for different authors (Alizadeh Sani, Ehsani, & Hashemi, 2017; Azevedo et al., 2015a,2015b; Gounga, Xu, & Wang, 2007; Hassannia-Kolaee, Khodaiyan, Pourahmad, & Shahabi-Ghahfarrokhi, 2016; Leuangsukrerk et al., 2014; Li et al., 2011; Oymaci & Altinkaya, 2016; Ozer et al., 2016; Qazanfarzadeh & Kadivar, 2016; Sothornvit, Hong, An, & Rhim, 2010; Wang, Auty, & Kerry, 2010; Zhang et al., 2016; Zinoviadou, Koutsoumanis, & Biliaderis, 2010; Zolfi, Khodaiyan, Mousavi, & Hashemi, 2014). However, to the author’s knowledge, few are the reported investigations about biodegradable films based on blends of WPI with polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH), like that one performed by Weizman et al. (2016). PVOH is a biodegradable synthetic polymer, soluble in water, obtained through the hydrolysis of polyvinyl acetate (Halima, 2016). This material has properties subordinated to its degree of hydrolysis and polymerization, and, therefore, can exhibit different molecular weights and mechanical properties, such as tensile strength and flexibility. As PVOH films use to show good stretchability, is expected that low addition percentages of this material to WPI matrix can improve the flexibility of WPI films. The brittleness reduction could certainly become WPI based films more suitable for food packaging systems, maintaining the biodegradability property. Considering that few are the studies reported about blends of WPI and PVOH for food packaging and the need of improve flexibility of WPI films, the objective of this work is to investigate the performance properties of this blend in order to evaluate the possibility of its application in food packaging sector. For this purpose, WPI films were added with 10, 20 and 30% of PVOH and evaluated regarding to: interaction phenomena (FT-IR) between these polymers, morphology of the blend formed (SEM), mechanical properties (tensile and puncture tests), water vapor transmission and solubility in water."
1,Material and methods,
2,Material,"2.1 Material The materials used for this research were: Whey Protein Isolate (WPI 9400) with 90% of native proteins produced by Hilmar Ingredients (Hilmar, CA, USA); Polyvinyl alcohol with high molecular weight (Mw = 130.000 g/mol) and highly hydrolyzed (99%), from Sigma-Aldrich (São Paulo, SP, Brazil); Glycerol (≥ 995%, density 1.26 g/mL), as plasticizer agent, produced by Sigma-Aldrich (São Paulo, SP, Brazil)."
3,Preparation of films and blends,"2.2 Preparation of films and blends 2.2.1 Preparation of films WPI film was produced using a concentration of 6% m/v of solution. WPI (12 g) was dissolved in 200 mL of distilled water, added with glycerol (30% m/m of WPI), and kept under agitation for 30 min (250 rpm). Then, the solution was submitted to water bath at 90 °C for 30 min, in order to guarantee complete proteins denaturation. After cooled at room temperature, it was homogenized in Ultra Turrax (Kika Labortchnik) for 20 min (450 rpm). The homogenized solution of 200 mL was sonified (Sonifier Cell Disruptor Branson – Model 450D, Manchester, UK) at 60% of amplitude (270 W), for 10 min (600 s) in a continuous assay, using ice bath to avoid heating. The ultrasonic energy applied to the solution was obtained through Eq. (1), resulting in 810 JmL−1. (1) A E = ( P . t ) v where AE corresponds to the ultrasonic energy applied (JmL−1), P is the power emitted by the sonifier (270 W), t refers to the time of ultrasonic agitation (600 s) and v to the volume of solution (200 mL) (Christensen, 1985). Solution was shed on a rectangular teflon plate (750 cm²), perfectly level, and conditioned at room temperature (25 °C) for spontaneous drying (48 h). PVOH film was also produced using a concentration of 6% m/v of solution. PVOH (12 g) was dissolved on 200 mL of distilled water and kept under agitation for 24 h (100 rpm) in order to hydrate the PVOH. Glycerol (30% m/m of PVOH) was added and the solution was kept under agitation for more 30 min (250 rpm). Then, the solution was submitted to water bath at 90 °C for 60 min. After cooled at room temperature, it was homogenized in Ultra Turrax and sonified in same conditions as those used for WPI film production. Finally, solution was shed on a similar teflon plate and conditioned at room temperature for drying. Three replicates of PVOH and WPI films were performed. The dried films was conditioned under controlled temperature and relative humidity (RH) (25 ± 1 °C and 50% RH) for 48 h before characterization. 2.2.2 Preparation of blends WPI and PVOH blends were produced varying the concentrations of WPI/PVOH (90/10, 80/20 and 70/30), maintaining the same total amount of polymer (6% m/v of solution) and plasticizer (30% m/m of polymers). Initially a PVOH solution was prepared by dissolving the polymer in 100 mL of distilled water, and it was kept under agitation for 24 h (100 rpm) in order to hydrate the PVOH. A WPI solution was separately prepared by dissolving it in 100 mL of distilled water, it was added the glycerol (3.6 g), and the solution was kept under agitation for 30 min (250 rpm). The both prepared solution (PVOH and WPI/glycerol) were separately submitted to water bath at 90 °C for, respectively, 60 and 30 min. Then the solutions were cooled to room temperature, merged, homogenized in Ultra Turrax, sonified, dried and conditioned in same conditions as those used for WPI and PVOH films production."
4,Characterization of films and blends,"2.3 Characterization of films and blends 2.3.1 Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis In order to identify possible interactions among the matrix constituents and to evaluate the structural changes resulted from the different films, samples were characterized by absorption spectroscopy on the region of infrared through a FTS 3000 Excalibur Digilab (United States), in Total Attenuated Reflection (ATR) mode, equipped with a KBr detector. All films were previously dried (100 ± 5 °C, 24 h) according to (Díaz, Candia, & Cobos, 2016), and the analysis range was from 4.400 to 400 cm−1 with 64 scans. Finally, seeking to classify the films by the different spectra obtained for each one, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was conducted using the Chemoface software, in which wavelengths data was used as variables and the transmittance values as answers. 2.3.2 Morphology Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used in order to evaluate film morphology and to investigate the presence of flaws, clusters, delamination, phase separation and other effects, which could be related to the mechanical and physical results. Films were analyzed through a LEO 1430 V P (England) using an accelerate voltage of 20 kV. Specimens were previously frozen in liquid nitrogen and fractured, in order to observe the morphology at the cross section, and then gold (Au)-coated using vapor deposition. 2.3.3 Mechanical properties and thickness Using a texturometer (Stable Microsystems, model TATX2i, England) with a load cell of 1 kN, it were measured the maximum tensile strength (TS), the tensile modulus (TM) and the maximum elongation (E) of films, according to D882-02 (ASTM, 2002). The specimens of 5 mm of width and 100 mm of length was submitted to the tensile test using a speed of 10 mm/s. TM was calculated from the tangent of the initial linear function of the stress-strain curve, considered as an elastic behavior. TS was found by dividing the maximum tensile by the film transversal section area, and E was calculated trough the percentage relation between the final and initial length of the specimen. Five repetitions were used for each repetition WPI and PVOH films and blends. Using the same texturometer and the load cell of 1 kN, it was analyzed the film performance concerning the puncture resistance (PR). The puncture test was conducted in specimens of 900 mm² by fixing them on a support with hole of 21 mm of diameter. A spherical probe with 5 mm of diameter (A/TG probe) was perpendicularly dislocated to the specimen surface in a speed of 0.8 mm/s until the film rupture. The PR, puncture resistance/thickness (N/mm), was calculated by dividing the tensile at the rupture by the film thickness. Four repetitions were used for each repetition WPI and PVOH films and blends. A digital micrometer (Digimess) was used to take 5 random measurements of the thickness per specimen, with a resolution of 0.001 mm. 2.3.4 Water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) Water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) were determined by gravimetry, following ASTM E96-10 (ASTM, 2010), using circular specimens with 80 mm of diameter. They were fixed in capsules containing silica gel, setting the humidity to 2.1%, which was considered as 0 (zero) in the atmosphere in contact with the specimen’s lower face. The capsules were placed in hermetic desiccators at 25 ± 1 °C in which a volume of sodium chlorate saturated solution sets the humidity to 75%. Weight gain measurements were taken by weighing the capsules (Analytical balance, resolution 0.001 g) each 24 h for 7 days. A plot of weight gained (Wg) versus time (t) was used to determine the WVTR, which was calculated by the Eq. (2): (2) W V T R = W g t A where: WVTR, given in (g.m−².s-1), is obtained through the slope of the linear portion of the plot and represents the steady-state amount of water vapor diffusing through the specimen, and A (m²) is the permeation area of the specimen. 2.3.5 Solubility in water Solubility in water was determined using square test specimens of 900 mm². The initial dry mass was obtained using an analytical balance after drying at 100 ± 5 °C for 24 h. The test specimens were immersed in a vessel containing 50 mL of distilled water and shaken at 100 rpm for 24 h at room temperature (at around 25 ± 1 °C). Then the specimens were dried again at 100 ± 5 °C for 24 h and weight in order to obtain the non-solubilized mass. Solubility of the films was expressed in percentage of specimen mass solubilized in relation to the initial mass. Three repetitions were performed for each film and blend."
5,Statistical analysis,"2.4 Statistical analysis In order to carry out statistical analysis of the results by comparing the means, Sisvar 5.0 was used to apply Scott-Knott test, with 95% of confidence level. The test was used for mechanical, WVTR and solubility results."
6,Results,
7,FT-IR,"3.1 FT-IR Fig. 1 presents spectra on the infrared region for WPI and PVOH films and blends. The main absorptions occurred on bands: 3270 cm−1, from 3000 to 2800 cm−1 and from 1770 to 790 cm−1. These specific regions of the general spectra (Fig. 1-a), can be better observed on Fig. 1-b and -c. All films presented the band localized on 3270 cm−1, which is related to the existence of NH in case of films with WPI, and/or to the stretch of OH groups and the water existence for all films (Guimarães et al., 2015; Ramos et al., 2013). The NH bond is a characteristic of the amino group of proteins, therefore is a typical band of WPI films. However, this band can be occurred for WPI film and for the blends due to the intra and intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the material’s matrix. Although PVOH does not contain NH groups in its chains, PVOH film presented the higher band intensity and width, probably due to a larger number of interactions by hydrogen bond among its chains and also to a larger amount of water molecules entrapped to its structure. Analyzing the blends, 70 W/30 P presented the lower intensity on 3270 cm−1 band. This fact can be associated to the lower amount of WPI and therefore of NH groups in its structure. On the other hand, the referred blend provided a spectra with an enlargement of the 3270 cm−1 band, indicating the formation of a larger amount of hydrogen bonds between WPI and PVOH. The PVOH hydroxyl groups (Fig. 2 -c) can easily interact with water and with many nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) atoms of β-lactoglobulin (Fig. 2-a), the major whey protein of ruminants (Kontopidis, Holt, & Sawyer, 2001). For 70 W/30 P blend, it is assumed that the PVOH OH groups were interacting with the protein chains in WPI, decreasing the amount of water entrapped in the film structure, and therefore decreasing the intensity of the 3270 cm−1 band. Bands from 3000 to 2800 cm−1 are associated to CH bond stretch (Guimarães et al., 2015). The PVOH spectra presented the higher absorption on this region, although the more PVOH was added to the blends, the more decreased the absorpion. As previously supposed, the larger amount of PVOH possibilited stronger linkages among PVOH and WPI proteins chains, and it probably reduced the streching of CH bonds in the structure. On 1744 cm−1 films with WPI presented a band with low intensity probably related to vibrations of CO and CN bonds characteristics from proteins. On 1626 cm−1, bands are attibuted to amide groups involved in the extended β-sheet structure, typical of WPI films (Ramos et al., 2013). This bands (1744 and 1626 cm−1) intensity decreased with the addition of PVOH, probably due to the lower amount of proteins in the structure which were replaced by PVOH chains, and maybe because interactions among PVOH and protein chains can cause interruptions on the extended β-sheet secondary structure of the proteins. Bands on 1521 cm−1 are related to the NH stretch from amina I group, and therefore, was present only for WPI film and blends. Similarly, bands from 1500 to 1350 cm−1 for WPI films and blends are possibly associated to bonds type NH from amide II groups (Ramos et al., 2013). The band on 1418 cm-1 was only observed for PVOH film, and is probably associated to the angular deformation of CH2 groups. The same exclusive phenomenon occurred on 1324 cm−1 for PVOH film, and this band can be related to an angular deformation of CH groups. Bands from 1350 to 1200 cm−1 can be associated to the vibrations of NH and CN (amide III) bonds for films with WPI. However, all films showed a band on 1230 cm−1, which can be attributed to angular deformation of CH2 for WPI and PVOH films and for the blends. At the region from 1150 to 800 cm−1, bands are related to the presence of glycerol for all films, corresponding to the vibration of CC and CO groups (Ramos et al., 2013). The graphic obtained for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be observed on Fig. 3 . Principal component 1 (PC1) contains 99.92% of variance, and then it was used to classify the groups formed. Spectra of WPI film, 90 W/10 P and 80 W/20 P blends were grouped, while PVOH film and 70 W/30 P blend were isolated. The addition of up to 20% of PVOH produced more similar structures to the WPI film than to the PVOH film, as expected, due to the higher amount of WPI constituent. On the other hand, the 70 W/30 P blend showed different spectra when compared to both, WPI and PVOH films, and it indicates the formation of new interactions and structures."
8,Morphology,"3.2 Morphology Fig. 4 a–j shows micrographs of WPI, blends and PVOH films. WPI film (Fig. 4-a and 4-b) exhibited at cross section a smooth and compact structure, with few pores or bubbles and without flaws or cracks. PVOH film also presented a compact structure, absent of flaws or cracks, but with a tendency of layer orientation (Fig. 4-i and -j). 90 W/10 P micrograph (Fig. 4-c and -d) showed that 10% of PVOH added provided a single phase blend, without layer delamination, possibly aided by the plasticizer. On the other hand, 80 W/20 P and 70 W/30 P exhibited single phase structures, but with roughness and orientation of layers, more evident on the blend 70 W/30 P with larger amount of PVOH. Li et al. (2014) observed a similar morphology of PVOH layers when analyzing PVOH films added with graphite oxide, and suggested a possible covering of graphite oxide layers by the PVOH layers. In the WPI/PVOH blends, supposedly the existence of many hydrogen interactions among polymeric chains from the both materials provided this layered and oriented structure. The structures obtained for all blends, without phase separation or clusters of materials, possibly indicate the existence of compatibility between the polymers, since compatibility between two polymers is sometimes described in literature as a condition where does not exist significative separation of phase (Quental et al., 2010)."
9,Mechanical properties and thickness,"3.3 Mechanical properties and thickness According to Guimarães et al. (2015), flexible film mechanical properties of highest interest are those related to TS, including TM and E. However, in case of food packaging, is also important to know the resistance of the material to the puncture for many applications, for example to known the resistance of the film to ink prints or pointed parts of food such as stems in fruit and bones in meats. Fig. 5 presents the results referring to the tensile test (TS, TM and E), conducted until the film rupture, and Table 1 shows the PR obtained through the puncture test. As observed on Fig. 5-a, the mean TS of the WPI films was 9.76 MPa, while films of PVOH presented the highest TS mean, 11.61 MPa. Blends presented TS values lower than PVOH film TS. The 90 W/10 P and 80 W/20 P blends were not significantly (p ≥ 0.05) different from the WPI film regarding the TS. On the other hand, 70 W/30 P was the one with the lowest TS, 7.62 MPa, which is almost 20% lower than the mean TS from the other two blends. Despite the observed TS reduction for 70 W/30 P, its TS (7.62 MPa) and those TS obtained for the other blends can be considered a close resistance to that found for low density polyethylene (LDPE) films, of 6.9–16 MPa, which is a material with widespread application in food packaging sector (Doak, 1986). WPI films presented a mean TM of 237 MPa, while PVOH films showed a mean TM almost 90% lower, 15 MPa (Fig. 5-b). According to Tian, Yan, Rajulu, Xiang, and Luo, (2017), PVOH is a material with great mechanical properties due to its flexible bonds of CC and to the plenty of OH groups in its chains. Probably, these chain characteristics provided this large film flexibility and the noticed low TM value. It was observed that, with PVOH addition, blends presented a decreasing in the TM value, as expected. 70 W/30 P blend showed a mean TM of 85 MPa, while 90 W/10 P and 80 WPI/10 PVOH TM was not significantly (p ≥ 0.05) different. The addition of 30% of PVOH provided a considerable higher flexible behavior when compared to the WPI film, being less rigid than commercial LDPE, which has a known TM of 102–240 MPa (Doak, 1986). Regarding to the elongation, PVOH film showed an E of 398.1%, while WPI film presented only 12.7% of E, confirming the fact that PVOH is a much more flexible material when compared to WPI (Fig. 5-c). The tensile test shows WPI behaving as a fragile material and PVOH as a ductile film. The addition of PVOH caused an increase in E for all blends, and the more PVOH was added, the more E value increased. 70 W/30 P (E of 126.8%) showed a significant gain in flexibility, nine times higher, when compared to the WPI film (E of 12.7%). A stretch capability of 126.8% related to the original length indicates a very flexible material. Qazanfarzadeh and Kadivar (2016) found 24% of E for WPI films with 50% of glycerol. This value is higher when compared to the observed on the present work for WPI film (12.7%), but can be justified by the larger amount of plasticizer used by the author. Guimarães et al. (2015) observed an E of 2.7% for starch films, while for starch/PVOH films in a proportion of 60/40, E increased nine times, to 26%. This result is similar to that observed in the present work, where the addition of 30% of PVOH into WPI matrix also provided an E nine times higher. In case of WPI matrix, it was necessary a lower amount of PVOH to produce the same effect of flexibility increase when compared to the starch matrix. The 70 WPI/30 PVOH blend presented an elongation which fits to the LDPE elongation range of 100–800% (Doak, 1986). It is inferred that the low tensile modulus and high elongation observed for this blend is closely related to the hydrogen bonds existence and to the observed preferential orientation of layers observed on FT-IR and SEM results. Possibly, a more ductile film was provided with the oriented layers anchored by the referred secondary bonds. Despite the known chain flexibility characteristic from PVOH, decreases in film tensile strength and increases in flexibility can be related with the number of crosslinks in the film material, and for blends, it can be also associated with the miscibility of the blended materials. When whey proteins are heated, their denaturation is induced, and then occurs the exposure of internal sulfhydryl groups from cysteine (Cys), which promotes disulfide bond formation among the chains, as showed on Fig. 2-b (Schmid et al., 2017). Methionine (Met) is the other aminoacid which presents a sulfur atom (Fig. 2-a), but it is unable to form disulfide bond. The WPI film formation, which involves the proteins heating, possibly provides these intermolecular disulfide bonds between cysteine aminoacids, producing a brittle and stiff film (high TM and low E). The PVOH in the matrix probably decreases the number of this kind of interaction among the WPI protein chains, and link with them and with another PVOH chains through hydrogen bonds, as observed on FT-IR results, leading to a higher flexibility (low TM and high E). This plasticizer effect of PVOH is widely explored by adding this polymer to starch films, to guarantee higher flexibility and ductility (Guimarães et al., 2015). The possible compatibility observed on SEM results for all blends explains the mechanical results, where blends were more ductile then isolated WPI. In literature, compatibility of blends can be related not only to the absence of phase separation, but also when the blend achieve a desired property (Quental et al., 2010). Analyzing the tensile properties obtained, TS, TM and E results suggest that blends were miscible, but with partial compatibility, which was responsible for increasing ductility (E), but not sufficient to keep the strength. Besides that, the tensile properties analyzed for the blends were intermediate to those from WPI and PVOH, indicating the existence of compatibility between these materials on the blends. The puncture test (Table 1) showed that the addition of 10, 20 or 30% of PVOH into the WPI matrix does not caused a significant (p ≥ 0.05) effect in PR of the WPI films. PVOH films presented a higher mean PR (212.2 N/mm) when compared to the WPI film (PR of 158.8 N/mm) and the blends. Films made with PVOH and plasticizer are usually tough tear-resistant and present resistance to perforation. However, the addition of 30% of PVOH into WPI matrix is not justified in order to increase the PR of WPI films. Azevedo et al. (2015a),2015b) found a PR for WPI films of 113.65 N/mm, value lower than those found in this work, probably because the author use an amount of 24% of glycerol, while in this work it was used 30%. Another hypothesis to explain this difference is the pH used for the film solutions. Azevedo et al. (2015a),2015b) used a pH of 8, while the present work used neutral pH (around 7.2), which produce different protein charges affecting the final film properties. In fact, in pH values more distant from their isoeletric point (around 5.5), the whey protein molecules are more charged, and therefore, they interact more with water molecules (Soares, Silva, & Oliveira, 2016). The higher pH used from Azevedo et al. (2015a),2015b) possibly leaded to a higher amount of water molecules in the WPI matrix, which acted as plasticizer, increasing the free volume among the protein chains and decreasing the PR. Muppalla, Kanatt, Chawla, and Sharma, (2014) developed PVOH films, but with a much lower amount of glycerol (0.1% v/v of film forming solution), and found a PR of 1.5 N of PVOH films with main thickness of 0.150 mm, which means a PR of 10 N/mm. This value is considerable lower than that found in the present work for PVOH film (212.2 N/mm) and, besides the different amount of glycerol, it can be justified by the probe diameter of 2 mm used by Muppalla et al. (2014), which is less than half of that used in this work (5 mm)."
10,Water vapor transmission rate (WVTR),"3.4 Water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) The vapor transmission tests showed no significant differences (p ≥ 0.05) on the water vapor barrier from WPI film and blends (Table 1), under the tested conditions (gravimetric method, at 25 °C and 75% RU). In WPI films, the presence of N and O atoms from amino and carboxylic acid groups guarantee the interaction of proteins with water molecules and also the formation of hydrogen bonds among the protein chains. Regarding the blends, the WVTR results indicate that PVOH did not influenced the interaction of WPI films with water. In films with partially hydrolyzed PVOH (Fig. 2-d), residual acetate groups could act decreasing the interaction between WPI matrix and water. However, the absence of these groups on highly hydrolyzed PVOH (as that used in the present work, Fig. 2-c), and the existence of hydroxyl groups in its chains (one OH by monomer), made this PVOH a material with high affinity to water. Because of this property, PVOH film showed the highest WVTR, differing from the other films with WPI. Despite this fact, PVOH did not act increasing the water barrier of WPI matrix, which is a positive result, since most food packaging require good water vapor barrier. When analyzed blends of starch with PVOH, Guimarães et al. (2015) observed an increase of WVTR with the addition of PVOH to the blend, and the authors justified that, in this case, PVOH acted as a facilitator of water transport through the blend due to the nature of its chemical structure with several hydroxyl groups. In the present work, the unchanged WVTR with the addition of PVOH in WPI films, possibly occurred due to the formation of a large amount of hydrogen bonds between WPI/PVOH molecules, leading to a cohesive structure with few free groups available to link with water and allow its permeation. On the other hand, the highly hydrolyzed PVOH structure, allows a higher permeation of water by associating its OH groups with the water molecules, with a higher diffusion of water molecules. The water vapor transmission rate of LDPE films is around 1.35 × 10−4 g.m-².s-1 (Mangaraj, Goswami, & Panda, 2015). WPI/PVOH blends allow that approximately five times more water get through them when compared to this commercial LPDE films."
11,Solubility,"3.5 Solubility The solubility results are presented on Table 1. Solubility can be subordinated to the presence or absence of affinity to water of materials in general. For WPI/PVOH blends, the strong interaction of PVOH by water did not act increasing the blends solubility in water. Despite the large amount of hydroxyl groups in PVOH, it is supposed that these groups were preferentially kept associated to the WPI chains. This result is analog to that found for WVTR of the blends, corroborating the hypothesis of formation of a large amount of hydrogen bonds among the WPI and PVOH chains confirmed through FT-IR analysis. This way, with the addition of PVOH from 10 to 30%, the blends solubility were not significantly (p ≥ 0.05) different, but presented a reduction when compared to WPI film solubility."
12,Conclusion,"The addition of 30% of PVOH to WPI films indicates the formation of new interactions and structures, with a large amount of hydrogen bonds interaction between WPI and PVOH, and a possible compatibility between these polymers. Besides that, the 30% of PVOH added provided a more ductile material, with a flexibility nine times higher to that from WPI films, leading to tensile properties close to that from LPDE, which is widely used on food packaging sector. However, PVOH did not act reducing the water barrier of WPI matrix, which would be desirable in order to apply this blend as food packaging. Despite the unchanged water barrier, the addition of 30% of PVOH caused a reduction on solubility of WPI film, which is positive when it comes to storage of food with high water content. Therefore, it is indicated the addition of 30% of PVOH in WPI matrix in order to improve its flexibility and reduce solubility in water, although improvements on water barrier are still necessary to apply this blend as packaging for food which require higher levels of moisture protection."
