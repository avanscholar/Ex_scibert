0,Introduction,"In recent years, energy sustainability and environmental problems have gained worldwide concerns. The utilization of renewable and carbon–neutral biomass to produce bio-fuels [1–3] and chemicals [4–6] is becoming more and more attractive because of the lower net CO2 emission [7,8]. As an additive or a potential alternative to gasoline, bio-ethanol has garnered much attention globally [9]. Currently, it’s mostly produced by fermenting sugars derived from corn starch or sugar cane [10]. Generally, the sugar fermentation generates the dilute aqueous ethanol solution, which makes the ethanol separation and purification more energy-intensive and costly due to the polar nature of ethanol molecule [11]. Nevertheless, the small-displacement gasoline engine is becoming more and more attractive due to the increasing pressure from reducing carbon emissions and rapid development of pure electric cars. Compared to bio-ethanol, higher alcohols have higher cetane number, higher energy density, non-hygroscopic, better blend stability and compression ignition quality and so on [12], which are attributed to the longer carbon chains of higher alcohol molecules [13]. These advantages of higher alcohols make it meaningful for the upgrading of bio-ethanol into higher alcohols, which are more compatible with transport fuel in no matter physical properties or combustion performances [4,14]. Especially, direct upgrading of aqueous ethanol solution which is readily available from sugar fermentation will be more attractive. Generally, Guerbet coupling reaction is one of the promising approaches to obtain higher alcohols from ethanol. In the Guerbet coupling process, a primary or secondary initial alcohol with methylene at the α-position is coupled with itself or other alcohol molecule to form the higher alcohols [15–17]. The mechanism of Guerbet condensation has been in dispute, but it’s generally accepted that three tandem steps proceed: the initial alcohols first proceed dehydrogenation to aldehydes, followed by aldol condensation of formed aldehydes to alkenal, and finally a saturated alcohol is formed by hydrogenation of alkenal [18–20]. The generated alcohol product can then proceed continuous condensation with itself or other alcohols existed in the system. Therefore, the step-growth process finally leads to the mixed higher alcohols product with C4+ carbon numbers. A series of heterogeneous catalysts have been investigated in the Guerbet chemistry, which can provide both acid and base sites [21]. In general, the catalytic activity of Guerbet reaction is not sufficiently high below 350 °C if none transition-metal promotor is adopted, and serious side-paths such as ethanol dehydration and decomposition happened above 350 °C will result in poor selectivity of higher alcohols [22,23]. As the intermolecular hydrogen transfer is believed to be necessary during the Guerbet chemistry for the transition between alcohols and aldehydes, so the addition of noble or transition metals such as Ir, Pd, Ru, Rh, Cu or Ni which possess superior ability for de-/hydrogenation and H-transfer can accelerate the Guerbet reaction [24–27]. Especially, Ni is attractive because it’s widely available and low cost. However, metal Ni usually favors the deep dehydrogenation reaction to generate the gaseous products (H2, CO, CO2, etc.), which prohibits the aldol condensation to form higher alcohols. Thus, that makes the execution of the dehydrated Guerbet reaction in high-content aqueous ethanol solution is still facing challenging [28,29]. Compared to metal Ni catalyst, Sn modified Ni catalyst exhibited the distinct properties in the hydrogen production reactions [30,31]. In the aqueous-phase reforming of biomass-derived oxygenated process, the addition of Sn to Ni also inhibits the formation of CH4 that generated from the cleavage of C-O bond and increases the H2 yield [32]. Based on this, we suppose that Sn modified Ni catalyst maybe a promising catalyst for the catalytic upgrading the aqueous ethanol to higher alcohols. In this work, the direct upgrading of aqueous ethanol to fuel grade higher alcohols was investigated over non-noble Sn modified Ni catalysts under mild hydrothermal conditions. The effects of the NiSn catalysts with different Ni/Sn ratio and reaction conditions on the performance of aqueous ethanol upgrading were investigated. Besides, several traditional noble metal catalysts were adopted for comparison, and the reusability of the spent NiSn catalyst was also tested. The mechanism and reaction pathway of catalytic upgrading of aqueous ethanol to C4+ higher alcohol over the dandelion-like Ni-Sn catalyst were also discussed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The dandelion-like Ni-Sn catalysts were prepared through a hydrothermal route as illustrated in Fig. 1 . In a typical synthesis procedure, chemicals of NiCl2·6H20, SnCl4·5H2O, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and urea of analytical grade were purchased from Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China), and used without further purification. The PVP was adopted as the stabilizing agent for the formation of spherical structure from Ni2+ and Sn4+ [33]. Firstly, NiCl2·6H2O (1.5 g), certain amount of SnCl4·5H2O and PVP (1.5 g) were dissolved in deionized water (60 ml) in sequence under continuous stirring to obtain a homogeneous solution. Then, a desired amount of urea (1.5 g) was added into above solution. After vigorously stirring for 30 min, the obtained green solution was sealed into a 100 ml Teflon-lined autoclave and proceeded the hydrothermal synthesis process at 120 °C for 15 h. After cooling down to room temperature naturally, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation. The precipitate was then washed with ethanol and deionized water for several times, followed by drying at 60 °C for 10 h in a drying oven to remove the excess water. The final obtained green solid was denoted as NiSnH-x catalyst (H means the hydrothermal synthesis route, and x is the molar ratio of Ni/Sn). Meanwhile, the Ni and Sn catalysts were also prepared with similar method except without adding SnCl4·5H2O or NiCl2·6H20 during the preparation procedure, denoted as NiH or SnH. These catalysts were directly used in the aqueous ethanol upgrading reaction without reduction and other pretreatments. The commercial 5 wt% Pd/C, Pt/C and Ru/C catalysts were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd., and directly used in the reaction for comparison if not otherwise specified."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted with a PANalytical X’Pert-Pro powder X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm), operated at a scanning speed of 5°/min from 5 to 80°. N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms was measured using a Micromeritics TriStar II instrument. Prior the measurement, the sample was first degassed at 200 °C for 10 h, then nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were obtained at 77 K. The specific surface area and pore size distribution of sample were determined by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method and Barrett-Joyner-Halanda (BJH) method respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out to analyze the chemical composition of prepared catalysts using a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI spectrometer. The sample powder was first pressurized to a self-supported wafer by a tablet machine for the subsequent analysis. The calibration of the binding energy values was conducted based on C1s C–C peak located at 284.8 eV. The Ni 2p, Sn 3d and O1s spectrums range from 885 to 845 eV, 500 to 480 eV and 545 to 525 eV were selected for further analysis respectively. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) was adopted to analysis the Ni and Sn content in catalyst sample using a Perkin-Elmer OPTIMA 8000 instrument. The surface morphology and microstructure of the prepared samples were observed with high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) on a Zeiss Merlin instrument at 5 kV accelerating voltage. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed on FEI Talos F200S instrument at 200 kV. Firstly, the samples were dispersed in anhydrous ethanol by ultra-sonication. Then the solution was dropped onto a carbon film supported on a copper grid for observation."
4,Catalytic experiments,"2.3 Catalytic experiments The upgrading of aqueous ethanol experiments were conducted in the 50 ml stainless steel batch reactor with a 25 mm mechanical stirring paddle (MS-50-316L, Anhui Kemi Machinery Technology Co., Ltd, Hefei, China. Fig. S2a). In a typical experiment run (schematic illustration of the experiment process shown in Fig. S1), 15 g/15 g equal mass of ethanol and deionized water mixture were added to the reactor along with 0.5 g catalyst and certain amount of NaOH, the molar ratio of ethanol/NaOH is 25/1. Then, the reactor was sealed and filled with N2 to 6 MPa for leakage detection. After that, the autoclave was flushed with hydrogen for 4 times. Finally, the reactor was sealed with H2 at ambient pressure (0.1 MPa), and then the temperature was heated to 250 °C with 5 °C/min before a 24 h hold, at the stirring rate of 500 rpm. The aim of sealing the reactor with H2 atmosphere is to provide a reductive and protective atmosphere for the Ni-based metal catalyst. After reaction, the autoclave was cooled to <20 °C with ice bath to minimize the loss of volatile components in the subsequent depressurization process. Gas product was collected with bag in the depressurization process. Liquid sample was collected and weighted for further analysis (Fig. S2b). For comparison, the upgrading of aqueous ethanol catalyzed by Pd/C, Pt/C and Ru/C noble metal catalysts were also conducted under same reaction conditions mentioned above. Meanwhile, effects of Ni/Sn ratio in NiSnH catalyst, reaction temperature and reaction time were also further investigated, respectively. Additionally, two successive reactions were carried out with the optimal NiSnH catalyst recovered between each run by filtration, washed with deionized water and dried overnight at 120 °C to examine the reusability of the spent catalyst."
5,Product analysis,"2.4 Product analysis The volume of obtained gaseous products were measured by a typical drainage method, and gas compositions were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC 9800, Kechuang, China) with FID and TCD detector. The liquid product was separated into water and organic phase samples through centrifugation. After centrifugation, the samples were weighed. Then, the water/organic phase samples were filtered through a 0.22 μm-pore-size syringe filter (Pall, JinTeng, China) prior to analysis. The liquid phase products were qualitatively analyzed using GC–MS (Agilent, HP-INNOWax, Thermo Fisher Scientific TRACE 1300ISQ). The column was heated at 50 °C for 3 min, ramped to 240 °C at 15 °C/min, and kept at 240 °C for 3 min. The mass spectrometer (MS) was operated at 70 eV over the scan range of 33–500 amu. The liquid products were quantitatively analyzed with internal standard method by GC system (Shimadzu 2010 Pro, HP-INNOWax column, 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.50 um). The 1-pentanol was adopted as the internal standard, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and acetone were used as the solvent. Carbon balance is determined based on moles of carbon before and after reaction according to Eq. (1). Due to the loss of part CO2 product caused by NaOH absorption, and the inevitably volatile loss in the depressurization process, liquid collection process and the undetectable compound, the carbon balances are usually below 95%. Yield, conversion, and selectivity are calculated on a carbon basis (C%). The conversion of ethanol (X) was determined according to Eq. (2), yield (Y) and selectivity (S) were also determined according to Eqs. (3) and (4), respectively. (1) Carbon balance C - mol % = ∑ Moles of carbon after reaction Moles of carbon in ethanol feedstock × 100 % , (2) Conversion X = Moles of ethanol disappeared Moles of ethanol fed to the reactor × 100 % , (3) Yield Y = Moles of carbon in the product Moles of carbon in ethanol fed to the reactor × 100 % , (4) Selectivity S = Moles of carbon in the target product Moles of carbon in all product × 100 %"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The texture properties of the prepared Ni-Sn catalysts were firstly analyzed by ICP and BET. As the N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms shown in Fig. 2 (a), the catalysts show typical type IV isotherms with hysteresis loops of type H4 in the P/P0 range of 0.4–1.0, which are the characteristic of mesoporous network [34]. Meanwhile, the pore size distribution in Fig. 2(b) confirms that the mesoporous distribution of catalysts is mostly between 2 and 5 nm except that of SnH catalyst. The inconspicuous hysteresis loop in isotherm and the pore distribution of SnH catalyst indicate the poor pore property. The physical–chemical properties of the measured catalysts are listed in Table 1 . All of the catalysts show a similar Ni/Sn element ratio with the design values. Meanwhile, it is obvious that the Sn contents significantly affect the surface areas of the catalyst. With increasing the Ni/Sn molar ratio from 0 to 29.2, the surface area and pore volume increased from 124.2 to 335.2 m2/g and 0.05 to 0.39 cm3/g, respectively. The high surface area of catalyst benefits the exposure of catalytic active center. The pore distribution and BET surface area of spent NiSnH-20 catalyst after a typical experiment run shows distinct difference from the fresh NiSnH-20. The spent NiSnH-20 still exhibited the characteristic of mesoporous network, but the BET surface area of spent NiSnH-20 notably decreased from 313.1 to 136.0 m2/g and the average pore diameter increased to 5.6 nm. These changes of spent NiSnH-20 catalyst indicate the structural change of catalyst during the reaction process. The X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the as-prepared NiSnH catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 a. All samples exhibit the low and broad diffraction peaks except the NiH catalyst, which indicates that the NiSnH catalysts have low crystallinity. Diffraction peaks at 2theta of 26.6°, 33.9°, 51.8°, and 66.0° of SnH and NiSnH-1 catalysts are assigned to SnO2 (JCPDS 01-088-0287). And the particle diameters were calculated by the Debye-Scherrer equation based on 26.6° (1 1 0) plane diffraction peak, which are 3.1 nm and 2.6 nm for SnH and NiSnH-1, respectively. With the increase of Ni/Sn ratio, new diffraction peaks ascribed to Ni(OH)2 (JCPDS 00-006-0144) appeared and peaks ascribed to SnO2 peaks weakened. With regard to the NiH catalyst, new diffraction related to Ni(HCO3)2 (JCPDS 00-015-0782) appeared, and as well the diffractions attributed to NiO particles (JCPDS 01-089-7130). These results indicate that the chemical state of Ni changed with the addition of Sn, and the NiSnH catalysts with Ni/Sn ratio ranged from 10 to 30 were mainly consist of Ni(OH)2 and SnO2. The XRD patterns of spent NiH and NiSnH-20 after a typical experiment run (250 °C, 24 h) were also analyzed. As shown in Fig. 3b, diffraction peaks of the spent NiSnH-20 changed obviously, new peaks of metallic Ni and Ni3Sn can be clearly observed. This result implies that the in-situ reduction of Ni(OH)2 and alloying of Sn and Ni happened during the aqueous ethanol upgrading reaction process, which could be attributed to the H2 reduction derived from the dehydrogenation of feeding aqueous ethanol [24]. The detailed structure and morphology of the NiSnH-20 catalyst was observed by SEM and TEM as shown in Fig. 4 . The SEM images shown in Fig. 4(a–b) reveal that the fresh NiSnH-20 catalyst shows a spheroidal morphology with diameter of more than 1 um. It is noteworthy that the surface of the fresh NiSnH-20 is rough and flocky. Meanwhile, according to the TEM images in Fig. 4(c–e), a dandelion-like structure was observed. The magnification image shows the average nano-sized fibers scatter on the sphere surface disorderly and connect to each other. The HAADF-STEM (high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy) images in Fig. 4(f) show a bright dandelion-like sphere with nano-sized fibers, which agree with the results of bright-field TEM. In addition, the element mapping of Ni and Sn in Fig. 4e indicates the homogeneous distribution of Ni elements in the dandelion-like sphere. However, the Sn element shows the surround distribution on the sphere surface, which implies that the Sn is mainly distributed on the nano-sized fibers scatter on the dandelion-like sphere surface. The structure of spent NiSnH-20 catalyst after a typical experiment run was also observed for comparison (Fig. S4). After reaction, the spent NiSnH-20 shows a disordered particle aggregate structure, and the dandelion-like sphere structure disappeared. Meanwhile, the element mapping (Fig. S4c–f) indicates that the spent NiSnH-20 still possess the homogeneous distribution of Ni and Sn. The disappearance of the dandelion-like sphere structure can be ascribed to the in-situ reduction of NiSnH-20 catalyst during the aqueous ethanol upgrading process as the BET and XRD analysis indicated. XPS analysis was used to further analyze the chemical composition and surface chemical state of the fresh and spent NiSnH-20 catalyst in the region of 0–1350 eV. Ni 2p, Sn 3d, O1s and C1s signal can be detected in the full-survey-scan spectrum (Fig. S5), which indicates the existence of Ni, Sn and O on the surface of fresh and spent NiSnH-20 catalyst. The peaks at 284.8 eV can be attributed to the CC bond, and the peaks at 286.6 eV and 288.7 eV correspond to the C-O and CO bonds, which is also consistent with the O1s spectra (533.2 eV, 531.6 eV) [35]. These results can be assigned to the residual PVP used in the solvothermal synthesis process, absorbed water and the Ni(OH)2 [36]. In addition, the peak with binding energy of 529.5 eV was assigned to the Ni and Sn metal oxide [37], which obviously enhanced in the spent NiSnH-20 catalyst due to the in-situ reduction mentioned prior. The Ni 2p peak has significantly split spin–orbit components, the Ni 2p3/2 region comprises the main peak and its satellite at around 856 eV and 862 eV. As shown in Fig. 5 c, the main Ni 2p3/2 peak at the binding energy of 856.0 eV is assigned to Ni(OH)2 [36]. The other two Ni 2p3/2 resolved peaks of the spent NiSnH-20 which located at 852.6 eV and 853.6 eV are attributed to Ni0 and NiO. These two new chemical state of Ni in the spent NiSnH-20 indicate that most of Ni(OH)2 was decomposed. This result is consistent with the XRD and O1s analysis. For Sn 3d spectrum in Fig. 5d, two groups of peaks were observed. The higher binding energy at 486.5 eV (Sn 3d5/2) and 495.4 eV (Sn 3d3/2) are attributed to the oxidized Sn species (Sn2+ and Sn4+), but the distinction between Sn2+ and Sn4+ is difficult owing to the negligible difference in the binding energies [38]. However, in combination with the XRD results, the oxidized Sn specie should be SnO2. In addition, the fitting peak located at 485 eV in the spent NiSnH-20 is assigned to Sn0, which probably exists as Ni3Sn as the XRD results observed. Therefore, it is likely that part of outer layer molten Sn diffuses into the Ni crystallites during the in situ reduction phase in the aqueous ethanol upgrading process, forming Ni3Sn alloys covering the surface of Ni particles analogous to previous reported. However, this NiSn alloy are indistinguishable by XPS from reduced Ni surfaces (Fig. S6) [32,39]. Indeed, the diffusion of Sn into Ni crystallites occurs rapidly at elevated temperature, especially above the melting point of Sn (232 °C)."
8,Catalytic upgrading of aqueous ethanol to higher alcohols,"3.2 Catalytic upgrading of aqueous ethanol to higher alcohols 3.2.1 Effect of Ni/Sn ratio in the NiSnH catalysts The effect of Ni/Sn ratio in the NiSnH catalysts on aqueous ethanol upgrading was investigated. The results are shown in Fig. 6 and Table S1, it clearly indicates that the interaction of Ni and Sn significantly affects the performance of aqueous ethanol upgrading. For the SnH catalyst, the ethanol conversion and liquid product yield are only 18.1% and 2.0%, which are only slightly higher than the blank control experiment (XEthanol and Yliquid product of 12.1% and 1.5%, Table S1), implying the poor catalytic activity of Sn for ethanol conversion. The inflated ethanol conversion of the blank control run should be related to the inevitable volatilization of ethanol in the depressurization process after reaction, and the obtained small amount of butanol product should be attributed to the existence of traces residual catalyst in the lacuna of stirring paddle which is difficult to clean up thoroughly. As the Ni/Sn ratio increased from 1 to 20, the ethanol conversion gradually increased from 19.8% to the highest 46.6%, but the selectivity of higher alcohols kept about 80%. Further increasing the Ni/Sn ratio to 30 resulted in the decrease of ethanol conversion and higher alcohol selectivity, while the selectivity of gaseous products increased to 22.7%. As for the NiH catalyst, the selectivity of C4+ higher alcohols sharply decreased to 35.6%, and the gaseous products selectivity reached 62.5%. This enhanced selectivity of gaseous products led to the notably decrease of higher alcohols yield. These results indicate that the addition of Sn to Ni forming Ni3Sn alloys and turning the electronic statement appears to suppress the production of gaseous products as well as promote the Guerbet coupling reaction to form higher alcohols. With the optimized Ni/Sn ratio of 20, the yield of liquid product reached 31.7%, and the C4+ higher alcohol selectivity of 91.6% with iso-/n- ratio of 0.83 in the liquid products was obtained. The carbon distribution of liquid product over different NiSnH catalysts was shown in Fig. 6(b). The main species in liquid product are C4+ higher alcohols including n-alcohol (liner) and iso-alcohol (branched). The yield of higher alcohols shows a gradually decreasing trend with carbon number (CN) increased. In addition, large amount of iso-alcohols species were detected when CN ≥ 6. It’s generally accepted that ethanol Guerbet condensation firstly proceeds with dehydrogenation of ethanol on metal sites of catalyst, then the generated aldehydes proceed the aldol condensation which being strongly facilitated by base sites, and followed by the hydrogenation of the formed unsaturated higher alcohols to higher alcohols. Generally, Sn is not an efficient catalyst for the dehydrogenation process, which is the initial step for Guerbet coupling or ethanol decomposition [40]. Therefore, the SnH catalyst shows poor activity. However, the transition metal Ni catalysts are promising for facilitating the H-transfer to accelerate alcohol-aldehyde interconversion [24,41]. Thus, the increase of Ni/Sn ratio promoted the catalytic activity. Nevertheless, Ni is also effective for the dehydration process and the APR (aqueous-phase reforming) process because it readily cleaves CC, CO bonds, as well as has high activity for the water–gas-shift reaction [32,42]. Therefore, the formation of undesired gaseous products was enhanced over NiH catalyst. The GC analysis results indicate that the gaseous products mainly consisted of CO2, CH4, H2, CO and light alkane. These results suggest that the combination of ethanol hydrogenolysis, dehydrogenation, APR, WGS, acetaldehyde decomposition and CO methanation may constitute the decomposition pathway to form the gaseous products from ethanol as reported before [43,44]. Typically, the aldol condensation reaction proceeded with a nucleophilic attack mechanism [45]. In the batch reactor, the generated Guerbet alcohol would then proceed condensation step by step with itself or other formed alcohols in the system. As a result, linear alcohols (n-alcohols) can only be produced when the nucleophile originates from ethanol, nucleophiles derived from other formed alcohols lead to the formation of iso-alcohols product with branch at the α position (Fig. 9) [19,46]. Therefore, the main species in spontaneous separated oil-phase product after reaction are 1-butanol, 2-ethyl-1-butanol, 1-hexanol, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, 1-octanol, 2-ethyl-1-octanol etc. (see Fig. S7), which is consistent with the previous reports [45]. Meanwhile, because the C4 alcohol can only be produced from condensation of two ethanol molecules, so only linear 1-butanol formed. Small amount of aldehydes (<3%) are also observed, which should be attributed to the initial alcohol dehydrogenation process. In addition, the longer chain alcohols are formed from the continuous condensation of generated higher alcohols or feed ethanol, which leads to the gradually decreased trend of higher alcohols distribution with the increase of carbon number. 3.2.2 Effect of reaction temperature The effect of reaction temperature on the performance of aqueous ethanol upgrading was investigated over NiSnH-20 catalyst. The reaction temperature is known to have obvious influence on the catalytic conversion of ethanol [47]. As can be seen from Fig. 7 , the ethanol conversion increased gradually from 22.0% to 50.9% as the reaction temperature increased from 200 °C to 270 °C. However, the liquid product yield increased first and then decreased. The results indicated that the high reaction temperature promoted the ethanol conversion, which is consistent with previously reported [24]. However, reaction temperature above 270 °C resulted in the aggravated ethanol decomposition side reaction and enhanced the production of gaseous products which is thermodynamically favorable. Moreover, it’s worth noting that higher selectivity of aldehydes was observed at relatively low temperatures below 230 °C and only trace aldehydes (~2%) was detected at 250 °C, which implied that the hydrogenation of aldehydes intermediate is relatively inert under mild temperature. As a result, the highest higher alcohols selectivity of 91.6% in liquid products was achieved at reaction temperature of 250 °C. 3.2.3 Effect of reaction time In order to gain more insights about the aqueous ethanol upgrading process, the effect of reaction time ranges from 6 to 36 h on the performance of aqueous ethanol upgrading over NiSnH-20 catalyst were investigated. As shown in Fig. 8 , ethanol conversion continuously increased from 20.9 to 48.2% over the whole range of reaction times. Nevertheless, prolonging reaction time from 24 to 36 h only gains about 2% increase of ethanol conversion. The selectivity of iso-alcohol shows a gradual increase trend with reaction time prolonging from 6 to 24 h, while the selectivity of n-alcohols decreases. Additionally, the selectivity of C8+ product shows a gradual increase trend as prolonging the reaction time within 24 h, while the C4 and C6 product show obvious decrease and slight decrease, respectively. However, prolonging reaction time from 24 to 36 h doesn’t change the carbon distribution obviously. These results indicate that the carbon chain growth and the aqueous ethanol upgrading reaction tends to be stable within 24 h. Besides, it’s worth noting that the yield of liquid product also increased within the initial 24 h as the ethanol conversion increased, but shows a slight decrease after 24 h. Apparently, this liquid product yield reduction can be ascribed to the unceasingly increased gaseous byproduct selectivity. 3.2.4 Comparison with the commercial noble metal catalysts The comparison of the catalytic activities was conducted by using different commercial de-/hydrogenation noble metal catalysts, and the results are listed in Table 2 . The ethanol conversion reached the highest of 62.6% over Ru/C catalyst, but the selectivity of undesired gaseous by-product reached 85.3%, which resulted in the higher alcohol selectivity as low as 13.4%. Meanwhile, the lowest ethanol conversion of 32.8% was obtained over Pt/C. These poor activities should be attributed to the excessive CC cleavage ability of metal Ru as previously reported [48], while Pt is typically found to be less active than Ru [49]. As for the Pd/C catalyst, we found it shows a comparable catalytic activity with the as-prepared NiSnH-20 catalyst. No significant difference of both ethanol conversion and the product selectivity was observed between Pd/C and NiSnH-20 catalysts. Given that the expensive price and rare reserves of Pd, the non-noble Ni-Sn catalyst may provide a potential alternative for the aqueous ethanol upgrading. 3.2.5 Reusability of the spent catalyst The reusability of the optimal NiSnH-20 catalyst was tested by reusing the spent NiSnH-20 catalyst in two successive reactions, the results were shown in Table 3 . It’s observed that the catalytic activity of the spent NiSnH-20 catalyst decreased in the first recycle test. Specifically, the ethanol conversion and liquid product yield decreased from 46.6% to 40.1%, and 31.7% to 26.3% respectively. In combination with the structural analysis results of spent NiSnH-20 catalyst, the reduced reuse activity of NiSnH-20 catalyst could be related to the decrease of surface area and the mass loss during the reuse process. As for the second recycle test, only slightly decrease of the activity was observed, which probably caused by the catalyst mass loss. These results clearly indicated the reusability of the NiSnH-20 catalyst."
9,Possible pathway in aqueous ethanol upgrading to higher alcohols over NiSnH catalyst,"3.3 Possible pathway in aqueous ethanol upgrading to higher alcohols over NiSnH catalyst The possible reaction pathway for aqueous ethanol upgrading over NiSnH catalyst was shown in Fig. 9 . Here, the formation of observed liner and α-branched higher-alcohol and aldehyde supports a typical Guerbet‐type mechanism. In general, the overall Guerbet coupling of ethanol follows a typical hydrogen borrowing pathway, involving dehydrogenation of ethanol, then the generated aldehydes proceed the aldol condensation which being strongly facilitated by bases, and followed by the last hydrogenation step of the formed unsaturated higher alcohols [20,24,45]. Typically, the aldol condensation reaction proceeded with a nucleophilic attack mechanism [45], and the formation of enolate in the nucleophilic attack is reported as the kinetic-relevant step in aldol condensation reactions in the Guerbet reaction [50]. As XRD and XPS results indicated prior, the metal Ni and Ni3Sn catalyst were formed in-situ during the thermal aqueous ethanol upgrading process. Nickel is active for dehydrogenation of the ethanol [42], as well as readily cleaves CC and CO bonds. That led to the formation of gaseous by-products including CO, CH4, CO2 and H2, which were produced by the ethanol hydrogenolysis, dehydrogenation, APR, WGS and methanation reactions consistent with the previous researches [21,43]. Meanwhile, the NaOH is beneficial to activate the methylene component via enhancing its nucleophilicity [21], which promotes the aldol condensation. Besides, we speculated that the Ni(OH)2 in NiSnH catalyst also acted as the base active sites together with homogeneous OH− for the condensation of the formed aldehydes as reported before [51]. It was reported that the addition of tin to nickel significantly inhibited the C-O bond cleavage in the aqueous-phase reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons [30,32], thus showed inhibition of alkane hydrogenolysis and promote the formation of dehydrogenated products. In this work, the promotion effect of enhanced higher alcohols production by adding tin to nickel was also observed. As shown in Fig. 9, the suppression of C-O bond cleavage probably inhibits the generated intermediate aldehydes on metal sites from cleaving, and thus the released intermediate aldehydes further facilitate the subsequent aldol condensation for carbon chain growth. That inhibition of the C-O bond cleavage may be caused by the presence of tin at nickel-defect sites and the formation of Ni3Sn alloy surfaces [32]. Consequently, it could be proposed that the Ni and the outer layer Ni3Sn works together to realize the ethanol dehydrogenation as well as inhibit the C-O bond cleavage, and finally the formed aldehydes proceed the base-catalyzed aldol condensation to realize the growth of carbon-chain."
10,Conclusion,"In summary, the direct upgrading of aqueous ethanol to fuel grade higher alcohols was investigated by using the non-noble Sn modified Ni catalysts in a batch reactor. The liquid product yield of 31.7% and C4+ higher alcohols selectivity of 91.6% with iso/n- ratio of 0.83 in the liquid product were obtained over NiSnH-20 catalyst after 24 h reaction at 250 °C, which is comparable with Pd/C catalyst. The reaction pathway were proposed based on the upgrading performance and catalyst characterization. The gaseous by-products were mainly produced by the dehydrogenation, APR, WGS and methanation side reactions. The metal Ni and Ni3Sn phase in the NiSnH catalyst were formed in-situ during the thermal aqueous ethanol upgrading process, the beneficial effect of Sn on the selectivity for production of higher alcohols could be related to the inhibition of C-O bond cleavage. This approach for the direct upgrading of aqueous ethanol may potentially avoid the energy-intensive ethanol separation and purification process. Meanwhile, the spontaneous phase-separable higher alcohol product would also be beneficial to its direct utilization as blend transport fuel."
