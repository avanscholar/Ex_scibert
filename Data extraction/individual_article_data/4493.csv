0,Introduction,"Manganese dioxide (MnO2) is a useful material in various industrial fields where it is used as a cathode material for metal-air batteries and fuel cells and as a catalyst for oxidation reactions, because of its high electron storage capacity and oxygen storage ability [1–5]. MnO2 has also been used as ionic- and molecular-sieves and as a catalyst, because it displays great cation-exchange and molecular adsorption properties [6,7]. Furthermore, it is seen as a promising candidate material because of its low cost, environmental compatibility, and natural abundance [2,3,8]. The physicochemical properties of MnO2 can be controlled by using different Mn precursors and synthesis conditions, e.g., sol–gel, gas condensation, microemulsion, solid state, hydrothermal, melting salt reflux, redox precipitation, and sonochemical processes [6,9–13]. In particular, the crystalline structure of MnO2 has an effect on its performance as a catalyst for CO oxidation. The catalytic activity improves in the order α-MnO2 ≈δ-MnO2 >γ-MnO2 >β-MnO2 [10,14,15]. Alcohols exist in a variety of structural isomers with their own intrinsic physicochemical properties such as hydrogen ion dissociation behavior (pKa). Several studies have examined the preparation of MnO2 using alcohols. Subramanian et al. synthesized MnO2 from methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, glycerol, and ethylene glycol respectively in potassium permanganate (KMnO4) solution, and Wu et al. also prepared MnO2 from KMnO4 and ethanol [8,9]. However, to the best of our knowledge, systematic studies on the effects of the alcohol's physicochemical properties, e.g., hydrogen dissociation behaviors and steric hindrance effects in solution, have not been performed. In order to perform a systematic study on the role of the alcohol used for synthesis, we synthesized MnO2 catalysts using KMnO4 with primary (1°), secondary (2°), and tertiary (3°) C2–C5 alcohols as reducing agents at room temperature and characterized using various analytical tools such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed desorption of CO (CO-TPD), and temperature-programmed reduction of H2 (H2-TPR) to elucidate their physicochemical properties. In addition, catalytic CO oxidation was performed to determine the relationship between oxygen species and catalytic activity in CO oxidation."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials In this study, KMnO4 (99.3mol%), ethanol (99.9mol%), 1-propanol (99.0mol%), 2-propanol (99.5mol%), 1-butanol (99.0mol%), isobutanol (99.0mol%), 2-butanol (99.5mol%), tert-butanol (99.0mol%), and 1-pentanol (99.0mol%) were purchased from Samchun Chemicals and used without further purification. The alcohols used in this study were denoted as CX=2–5 in accordance with their number of carbons."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation MnO2 was prepared by mixing 0.2M KMnO4 and 0.81mol C2–C5 alcohols at room temperature for 1h under vigorous stirring. Black powder was obtained in 1° alcohols, while brown powder was observed for 2° alcohols from the purple-colored solution. No precipitate formed with tert-C4 (3° alcohol). The powder was filtered by 4L distilled water, and dried at 80°C for 12h. Finally, the sample was calcined at 300–500°C for 2h with a heating rate of 2°Cmin−1 under flowing air."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Elemental analysis, which was especially needed to quantify residual potassium ion (K+) in samples, was performed using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Optima 7300DV, Perkin Elmer). Crystalline structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Discover with GADDS, Bruker AXS) with Cu Kα1 radiation operating at 40mA and 40kV in the range of 2θ =10–80°. Particle size (D hkl) was measured in nm using the Scherrer–Warren equation, D hkl = K λ β cos θ where K is a dimensionless shape factor (0.89), λ is the wavelength of the X-rays (λ =0.15406nm), β is the line broadening at full width at half maximum (FWHM) in radians, and θ is the diffraction angle in degree. XRD patterns of manganese oxides were compared with the JCPDS standard files of 80-1098 (δ-MnO2), 44-0141 (α-MnO2), 80-0382 (Mn3O4), and 78-0424 (MnO). Specific surface area (S BET) and total pore volume (V p) were determined by N2-physisorption (ASAP2020, Micromeritics) at −196°C. Prior to measurement, each sample was degassed at 200°C until reaching a pressure of at least 10−3 Torr. S BET was calculated in the range of P/P 0 =0.05–0.20, while V p was measured at P/P 0 =0.995. The oxidation states of the Mn and O species on the catalyst surface were identified by XPS (ESCALAB 210 Electron Spectrometer) with Al Kα radiation (hν=1486.6eV). All binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.6eV from adventitious carbon. The morphology of the MnO2 catalysts synthesized with C2–C5 alcohols and calcined at 300–500°C for 2h was examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM, LEO-1530, Carl Zeiss) at 3kV. Thermal behavior was observed using differential thermal analysis (DTA, SDT 2960, TA Instruments). An as-prepared MnO2 sample (as-MnO2, 0.01g) was loaded into an alumina pan, and the DTA instrument's weight sensor was allowed to stabilize for 20min at room temperature. The temperature was then increased from room temperature to 800°C at a rate of 10°Cmin−1 under flowing air (110cm3 min−1). H2-TPR of MnO2 (0.03g) was carried out in a U-shaped quartz reactor (I.D. 12mm). Prior to analysis, samples were pretreated at 300°C for 1h at a heating rate of 2°Cmin−1 under flowing Ar (30cm3 min−1) and being cooled to room temperature. The reactant gas (10% H2-Ar) was flowed through the reactor at a rate of 30cm3 min−1 while the sample was heated to 400°C at a rate of 10°Cmin−1. H2 consumption was detected using a quadruple mass spectrometer (QMS, ThermoStar GSD 301T, Pfeiffer Vacuum) and calculated from the H2 (m/z =2) signal. CO-TPD was performed in the same apparatus used for H2-TPR. After pretreatment of the sample at 300°C for 1h under flowing Ar, CO was preadsorbed in the catalyst bed under flowing 5% CO-Ar (30cm3 min−1) for 1h. Then the reactor was purged with an Ar stream (30cm3 min−1) for 30min to remove weakly adsorbed CO from the catalyst surface. Finally, the sample was heated from room temperature to 800°C at a rate of 10°Cmin−1. Desorbed CO was detected as CO2 (m/z =44), which is the reaction product between adsorbed CO and lattice oxygen species in MnO2 by the QMS."
5,Catalytic activities,"2.4 Catalytic activities The catalytic CO oxidation reaction was performed in a fixed bed configuration with the U-shaped quartz reactor. Prior to initiating the catalytic reaction, the catalyst (0.05g) was pretreated at 300°C for 1h at a heating rate of 2°Cmin−1 under flowing N2 (200cm3 min−1). The reactant stream of 1% CO, 4% O2, 19% Ar, and 76% N2 was flowed at a rate of 200cm3 min−1. CO concentration in the product stream was detected each second by an infrared gas analyzer (Model 7500, Teledyne Analytical Instruments). CO conversion was calculated by the consumed molar percentage."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Physicochemical properties,"3.1 Physicochemical properties Table 1 shows the physicochemical properties of MnO2 synthesized using C2–C5 alcohols with different chain lengths and shapes. ICP analysis results revealed that all samples contained large a quantity of K+ (8–13wt%). Generally, K+ is difficult to separate from MnOX, because K+ resides in the center of the MnOX tunnel structure [6]. The S BET of MnO2 had a strong dependence on the kind of alcohol used. The S BET of MnO2 (C2) was 187m2 g−1, which was the largest of all the prepared samples. On the other hand, the S BETs of MnO2 (2-CX=3,4) were 38 and 44m2 g−1, much smaller than MnO2 (1-CX=2–5 and isoC4). It is believed that the variation of the S BET of MnO2 may be correlated with the hydrogen dissociation constants (pKas) of the alcohols used. The relevant pKa values are summarized in Table 1 [21–24]. These are intrinsic values determined in reference to H2O solution. The pKas of 1° alcohols (pKa =16.0–16.6) are far lower than those of 2° alcohols. The values of pKa for 2-C3 and 2-C4 alcohols are 17.1 and 17.6, respectively. C2 has the lowest pKa value of the alcohols used in this study. Because of weak steric hindrance effects, C2 alcohol itself causes hydrogen ion (H+) dissociation in H2O solutions relatively easily. Alcohols with higher pKas support very limited H+ dissociation due to strong steric hindrance effects [22]. At higher H+ concentrations, Mn7+ is reduced to Mn4+ more easily during the redox reaction between MnO4 − and alcohols. When redox reactions proceed rapidly, nucleation and growth rates increase, producing smaller particles [16] with an increased S BET. Table 1 also shows the exothermal peak temperature of as-MnO2 analyzed by DTA. Typically, MnO2 reduces auto-thermally to Mn2O3 at ca. 500°C [4,11]. For samples produced by 1° alcohols the reduction temperature increases in the order of as-MnO2 (C2)<1-C3 <1-C4 <1-C5 <isoC4. In addition, as-MnO2 (1-CX=2–5) has a lower reduction temperature than as-MnO2 (2-CX=2,3). These results agree with D hkl growth behavior, because the crystalline structure changed more easily in smaller particles. However, even in these catalysts, crystal growth rate and orientation produced different results that were dependent on which reductant was used (Table 1). Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of manganese oxides synthesized using KMnO4 and C2–C5 alcohols as reducing agents and calcined at 300–500°C. The crystalline structure of MnO2 depends on the type of alcohol used and on the calcination temperature used. All samples calcined at 300°C showed a δ-MnO2 structure. MnO2 synthesized with 1° alcohols (1-CX=2–5) underwent a phase transition from δ- to α-MnO2 after calcination at 400°C. After the calcination of MnO2 at 500°C, the highest peaks for MnO2 synthesized with a short chain alcohol such as a C2 alcohol were at 2θ =37.5° (211). However, the primary peak for MnO2 synthesized with the 1-C5 alcohol appeared at 2θ =12.6° (110). Particle size based on the (211) peak increased in the order of MnO2 (1-C5)<1-C4 <1-C3 <C2. Meanwhile, in case of MnO2 produced with isoC4 and 2-CX=3,4, particle size measured at 2θ =12.6° (001), which is the highest peak in the δ-MnO2 phase, increases in the order of MnO2 (2-C4)<isoC4 <2-C3 after calcination in a temperature range of 300–500°C. The crystallinity of δ-MnO2 (isoC4 and 2-C4) also increased after calcination at 400°C. A mixture of δ- and α-phase was observed after calcination at 500°C, while pure δ-MnO2 (2-C3) was obtained after calcination at 500°C. The XRD patterns of MnO2 (C2) indicated a MnO phase after H2-TPR at 400°C, and a mixture of α-MnO2 and Mn3O4 was shown in MnO2 (1-C4 and 2-C4) after CO-TPD to 800°C. Fig. 2 shows the evolution of the morphology of MnO2 catalysts synthesized by the reaction of KMnO4 with C2–C5 alcohols as the reducing agent. The size and shape of MnO2 particles were dependent on the chain length and shape of the C2–C5 alcohols used as reductants. All of the MnO2 catalysts that were calcined at 300°C were found to have a low crystalline δ-phase structure by XRD analysis and a similar spherical shape. The short chain length alcohol such as C2 alcohol is favorable to synthesis of MnO2 with smaller particles than the C3–C5 alcohols. Similarly, 1° alcohols produced smaller particles than 2° or iso alcohols during preparation of MnO2. The partial morphological transformation to nanorod-shapes was observed for MnO2 (1-CX=2–5) calcined at 400°C and MnO2 (isoC4 and 2-C4) calcined at 500°C. MnO2 (2-C3) maintained a primarily spherical shape until a small quantity of plate-shaped MnO2 appeared after calcination at 500°C. The observations indicate that smaller particles of MnO2 promote the phase transformation from δ- to α-phase and have a less thermal stability. To determine the oxidation states of MnO2 calcined at 300°C, XPS analysis was performed. Fig. 3 shows XP spectra of Mn 2p and O 1s, and the binding energies (BEs) of Mn 2p and O 1s are summarized in Table 2 . Commonly, Mn 2p3/2 has two peaks located at ca. 641 (Mn3+) and 642eV (Mn4+). Moreover, the satellite peak of Mn 2p3/2 appears at ca. 645eV [17]. Mn3+ forms in the presence of labile lattice oxygen, suggesting the formation of non-stoichiometric MnO2-X. The percentage of Mn3+ was 15.6% for MnO2 (1-CX=4,5) and 10% for MnO2 (2-C4). For the O 1s peak, BEs existed at ca. 529 and 531eV representing surface lattice oxygen (MnOMn) and an adsorbed hydroxyl group (MnOH), respectively [18]. The portion of MnOMn was ca. 66% for MnO2 (1-CX=4,5) and below 55% for MnO2 (2-CX=3,4). The abundance of the Mn3+ oxidation state and MnOMn in MnO2 catalysts is believed to be correlated to their catalytic activity for CO oxidation [18]. H2-TPR was performed to analyze the reducibility of MnO2 to non-stoichiometric MnO2-X, and the results are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 3 . Reduction of MnO2 by H2 can proceed as 2MnO2 +H2 →Mn2O3 +H2O 3Mn2O3 +H2 →2Mn3O4 +H2O Mn3O4 +H2 →3MnO+H2O Theoretically, the reduction of MnO2 to MnO proceeds in a three-step process, which includes the stepwise formation of Mn2O3, Mn3O4, and MnO. However, H2-TPR displayed only two reduction peaks in the temperature range of 265–310°C. One large peak indicates the reaction of MnO2 to form Mn3O4, and the other small peak is for the formation of MnO. The first large peak might contain two peaks for the reduction of MnO2 to Mn2O3 and of Mn2O3 to Mn3O4 [10]. The final MnO phase was verified by XRD analysis as shown in Fig. 1 [10,19]. The reduction of MnO2 (1-CX=2–5) to non-stoichiometric MnO2-X occurs at relatively lower temperature than that of MnO2 (2-CX=3,4 and isoC4). Generally, CO adsorbed on the surface of MnO2 catalysts reacts with lattice oxygen in the MnO2 to produce CO2. Sequential production of CO2 may be described by MnO2 +CO→Mn2O3 +CO2 Mn2O3 +CO→2Mn3O4 +CO2 Mn3O4 +CO→3MnO+CO2 Fig. 5 and Table 3 show the results of CO-TPD analysis. Two CO2 (m/z =44) peaks with different shapes appear at 100–150°C and 450–500°C [20]. The lower temperature peak is attributed to the labile lattice oxygen species of MnO2. The higher temperature peaks indicate oxygen species produced during the reduction of MnO2 to Mn3O4, which was verified by XRD analysis of sample obtained after CO-TPD (Fig. 1). The relative quantity of lattice oxygen species in MnO2 detected by CO-TPD is summarized in Table 3. The relative quantity of lattice oxygen species in MnO2 (1-CX=2–5 and isoC4) was greater than 3.4, which was larger than that in MnO2 (2-CX=3,4). The relative quantity of lattice oxygen was maximized in MnO2 (1-C4) and decreased in the order of MnO2 (1-C4)≈1C5 >1-C3 ≈C2 >isoC4 >2-C4 >2-C3. According to this trend, it is believed that the environmental condition of oxygen in MnO2 mainly depends on the kind of reducing agent used for synthesis."
8,Catalytic activities,"3.2 Catalytic activities Temperature-programmed oxidation of CO was performed over MnO2 catalysts synthesized using C2–C5 alcohols with different chain lengths and shapes (Fig. 6 and Table 3). The catalytic activities of MnO2 catalysts synthesized with 1° alcohols were higher than those synthesized with iso and 2° alcohols. The catalytic activity, which was based on T 50% and T 80% values, depended on the alcohol used in the order of MnO2 (1-C4)≈1-C5 >1-C3 ≈C2 >isoC4 >2-C3 >2-C4. These results were compared with the presence of lattice oxygen species. Fig. 7 shows the correlations between T 50%, which represents catalytic activity, and the relative quantity of lattice oxygen species on the MnO2 surfaces determined by XPS and CO-TPD analyses. The MnO2 (1-C4) catalyst had the highest MnOMn fraction as detected by XPS and also had the largest quantity of desorbed CO2 during the reaction between adsorbed CO and lattice oxygen on the MnO2 surface as measured by CO-TPD."
9,Conclusions,"Crystalline MnO2 catalysts were prepared from KMnO4 with C2–C5 alcohols of different chain lengths and shapes. A simple change to the calcination temperature in the range of 300–500°C controlled the crystalline structure to be either MnO2 or MnO2. The physicochemical properties of MnO2 catalysts were clearly dependent on the chain length and shape of the C2–C5 alcohol used as the reducing agent. MnO2 prepared using 1° alcohols such as 1-CX=2–5 alcohol have relatively high S BET compared to those synthesized with iso and 2° alcohols (C3–C4 alcohols). MnO2 catalysts prepared using 1° alcohols (1-CX=4,5) showed better catalytic activity for CO oxidation than those prepared with isoC4 or 2° alcohols (2-CX=3,4). Improved catalytic activity was correlated with the quantity of lattice oxygen species in the MnO2, even for MnO2 catalysts (1-CX=4,5) with a lower S BET. Thus, the availability of labile lattice oxygen species on the MnO2 surface was determined to be more crucial to improving catalytic oxidation performance than any other physicochemical property."
