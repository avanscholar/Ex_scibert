0,Introduction,"Selective dehydrogenation of unsaturated alcohols is important in the synthesis of fine chemicals, such as unsaturated aldehydes used for fragrances and pharmaceuticals. Unsaturated alcohols contain reactive chemical structures such as hydroxyl groups and carbon-carbon double bonds, thus making it difficult to selectively dehydrogenate hydroxyl groups because hydrogenation of both the carbon–carbon double bonds and carbonyl groups can occur [1]. Hydrogen permeable membrane reactors such as palladium membrane reactor are able to promote dehydrogenation, because the equilibrium of dehydrogenation shifts to the dehydrogenation side by hydrogen removal from reaction side to permeation side [2–8]. Dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene [9], propane [6,10,11] and isobutane [11,12] has been shown to be promoted with palladium membrane reactors. Hydrogen permeable membrane reactors can probably be useful in the selective dehydrogenation of unsaturated alcohols to unsaturated aldehydes, because the hydrogen produced in the initial dehydrogenation can be removed from the reaction side and the hydrogenation that would normally follow can be suppressed. Membrane reactors can be applied to dehydrogenation of alcohols to form aldehydes or ketones in chemical syntheses [13–19]. Liu et al. [13] performed the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethanol with a NiP–Cu composite membrane and found that both conversion and selectivity increased with an increase in the flow rate of sweep gas on the permeation side. Lin and Chang [16] conducted ethanol dehydration with a palladium-based membrane reactor. They reported that the main product was acetaldehyde and the increase in flow rate of sweep gas was found to promote ethanol conversion. Keuler and Lorenzen [17] studied the dehydrogenation of ethanol in a Pd–Ag membrane reactor and plug-flow reactor. They reported that the total ethanol conversion and selectivity of acetaldehyde in the membrane reactor were higher than those in the plug-flow reactor. They also constructed a model for dehydrogenation of ethanol that could describe the reaction rate. For long chain alcohols, Trianto et al. [18] conducted a study on the dehydration of 2-propanol to yield acetone with a Vycor glass-based porous membrane reactor and reported that the acetone concentration in the permeation side increased with sweep gas flow rate. Keuler and Lorenzen [19] examined the dehydrogenation of 2-butanol in a Pd–Ag membrane reactor. They showed that 2-butanol conversion increased with sweep gas flow rate and reported methyl ethyl ketone selectivities above 96%. However, the effect of hydrogen removal on dehydrogenation of unsaturated alcohols in many of these studies is still not well documented. In this study, we conducted the dehydrogenation of cis-3-hexen-1-ol with a Pd-Ag membrane reactor with and without hydrogen separation by the low pressure permeation side. We determine the reaction pathway and then compare the results with and without hydrogen separation to evaluate the effect of hydrogen separation on product distribution. After that, we propose a reaction model to estimate the trends of the experimental results."
1,Experimental,"The cis-3-hexen-1-ol had a purity of 98>% and was obtained from ZEON Corporation. The CuO–ZnO catalyst was purchased from Nikki Chemical Co., Ltd. (No. E09Y) and used as catalyst. The catalyst properties are shown in Table 1 . Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the overall apparatus used in this study. The reactor was a stainless steel tube that was 170mm in length and 10.3mm in inner diameter. The membrane tube consisted of 77% palladium and 23% silver, was 100mm long, 3.2mm outer diameter and 0.2mm thick, and was closed at one end. This membrane tube was connected in the center line of the reactor. For a given experiment, 1.0g of crushed catalyst mixed with 11.5g of glass beads was loaded around the membrane to form a catalyst bed. Silica wool and stainless steel mesh were placed around the catalyst bed to fix it. The length of the catalytic bed was 100mm within the membrane tube. The membrane reactor and the preheater were placed in the thermostat that was controlled at the reaction temperature. The cis-3-hexen-1-ol was supplied with a microsyringe pump (HARBARD, PHD4400) and diluted with argon. In this study, the ratio of initial molar flow rate of cis-3-hexen-1-ol to that of the sum of the alkenol and argon was 0.45. The mixture of cis-3-hexen-1-ol and argon became gaseous in the preheater and homogeneous, and then passed into the membrane reactor. The reaction was conducted from 443K to 503K under atmospheric pressure. For the hydrogen separation experiments, the permeation side was aspirated by a vacuum pump (ULVAC, DA-41D) below 0.01MPa in an absolute pressure gauge. In the experiments without hydrogen separation, no aspiration was used. After the reaction, the effluent gas stream was sampled and analyzed by GC-TCD (Shimadzu GC-14A) with argon carrier and a PEG200 column. The products were also recovered as liquid and those were analyzed with GC–MS (GC-17A-QP5050A, Shimadzu) for qualitative analysis. The compounds were routinely analyzed by comparison of the GC-TCD retention time with that of the standards for quantitative analysis. The flow rates of gases from both reaction and permeation side were measured by using a soap-film flow meter. The product yield, conversion and product selectivity were defined on a carbon basis as follows: (1) product yield ( mol % ) = molar flow rate of products ( mol / s ) inital molar flow rate of reactant ( mol / s ) × 100 (2) conversion ( mol % ) = 100 − molar flow rate of reactant ( mol / s ) inital molar flow rate of reactant ( mol / s ) × 100 (3) selectivity ( mol % ) = product yield conversion × 100 Experiments were also performed for the evaluation of hydrogen permeability of the Pd–Ag membrane from 443 to 523K. The hydrogen was fed into the reaction side at constant pressure from 0.12 to 0.20MPa at the pressure of permeation side being atmospheric pressure, and then the flow rate of hydrogen permeated through the membrane was measured."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Performance of membrane reactor,"3.1 Performance of membrane reactor Before the reaction, we evaluated the hydrogen permeability of the Pd–Ag membrane. Fig. 2 shows the hydrogen flow rate on the permeation side against the differential pressure between reaction side and permeation side at each temperature. The flow rate of hydrogen was proportional to the difference of square root of the hydrogen partial pressure, which indicates that the kinetics of hydrogen permeance almost obeyed Sievert's law [20]. Therefore, we estimated the permeability of the membrane (P perm) at each temperature by Eq. (4) from the slope of corresponding line in Fig. 2: (4) J = 2 π L 0 P perm ln ( R 0 / R i ) ( P reac , H 2 − P perm , H 2 ) where J is the flow rate of hydrogen permeated. The hydrogen permeation rate increased with increasing temperature. The permeabilities were 6.829×10−9, 7.582×10−9, 8.460×10−9 and 9.269×10−9 [mol/(msPa0.5)] at 443, 473, 503 and 523K, respectively. These permeabilities were the same order as standard Pd and Pd–Ag composite membranes reported in the literature [20]."
4,Reaction kinetics,"3.2 Reaction kinetics We conducted dehydrogenation experiments on cis-3-hexen-1-ol with the membrane reactor. The major products, cis-3-hexenal, 1-hexanol and hexanal were detected in the GC-TCD analysis. In the GC–MS analyses of recovered samples, traces of trans-3-hexen-1-ol, 2-hexenal, cis-3-hexenyl hexanoate, 2-butyl-2-octanal and hexanoic acid were also detected. In this paper, we will discuss the reaction kinetics by considering the major products detected. Prior to detailed analyses of the experimental data, we evaluated the relationship between the yield of cis-3-hexen-1-ol and space time, W/F [skg-cat/mol], which is the weight of catalyst per initial molar flow rate of cis-3-hexen-1-ol in the feed. In the experiment, the reaction did not start at W/F =0, which is probably due to heat-up, mixing and other factors related to experimental configuration. Therefore, we evaluated the real space time by assuming that the reaction was governed by first order kinetics and a plot of −ln(1− X) versus W/F was made for all data in this study. In the initial stages of the reaction, below W/F of 40, the data exhibited close to liner behavior and extrapolation of the line to zero conversion provided an estimate for the apparent zero conversion space time. The intercept of line was 18.0[skg-cat/mol], so it was assumed that the reaction started at W/F =18, and this value was subtracted from the actual space times. Fig. 3 shows the yield of products with space time at 443K. For the case without hydrogen removal, the yield of cis-3-hexen-1-ol decreased with space time, which lead to an increase in the yield of hexanal. The yield of cis-3-hexenal and that of 1-hexanol were smaller than those of the other two compounds, and slightly increased and then became almost constant against space time. From these results, the main reaction pathway can be proposed as Fig. 4 . At first, the hydroxyl group of cis-3-hexen-1-ol was dehydrogenated to form cis-3-hexenal and hydrogen. After that, hydrogenation of the alkene group of cis-3-hexenal occurred to form hexanal and hydrogenation of the alkene group of cis-3-hexen-1-ol yielded 1-hexanol. Above hydrogenation was started by the hydrogen produced through the dehydrogenation of cis-3-hexen-1-ol. Finally, dehydrogenation of the hydroxy group of 1-hexanol yielded hexanal. The direct reaction from cis-3-hexen-1-ol to hexanal scarcely proceeded because both dehydrogenation of the hydroxyl group of the alcohol and hydrogenation of alkene group hardly occurred on the catalyst at the same time. It is known that Cu reduced by hydrogen or alcohols promotes the decomposition of alcohol with Cu/Zn catalyst. Pefe and Polini [21] reported that Cu was the reactive species in the decomposition of 2-propanol with CuO/ZnO catalyst. The detailed reaction kinetics of cis-3-hexen-1-ol was not made clear in that study as Cu might act as a reactive species. Hydrogen removal from the reaction side was found to affect product distribution as shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3, the yields of cis-3-hexen-1-ol with hydrogen separation was mostly higher than those without hydrogen separation. The conversion of reactant was suppressed by hydrogen removal from the reacting mixtures. The yield of cis-3-hexenal with hydrogen separation was higher than that without hydrogen separation whereas the yield of hexanal and that of 1-hexanol with hydrogen permeation was lower than those without hydrogen permeation. When hydrogen was removed from the reaction side, cis-3-hexenal formed through dehydrogenation was preferred to form and the products such as hexanal and 1-hexanol through hydrogenation were not preferred. These results indicate that the lack of hydrogen accelerated dehydrogenation and inhibited hydrogenation to enhance the formation of aldehyde which is the same as that observed for the dehydrogenation of primary alcohols with hydrogen permeable membrane reactors [13–17]. Fig. 5 shows the selectivity of the major products against conversion with and without hydrogen separation. Because the selectivity of 1-hexanol was below 17%, cis-3-hexenal and hexanal were the major products. The selectivities of cis-3-hexenal decreased with conversion whereas the selectivity of hexanal increased, which supports reaction pathways as shown in Fig. 4 [22]. The selectivity of cis-3-hexenal and hexanal ranged from 9.4 to 65.0% and from 32.6 to 80.4%, respectively. In the early reaction stages below 30% conversion, the selectivities of cis-3-hexenal with hydrogen separation were about 10–40% higher than those without hydrogen separation, whereas the selectivities of hexanal with hydrogen separation were almost 20–30% lower than those without hydrogen separation. In the region of high conversion, the difference of selectivities of both cis-3-hexenal and hexanal with and without hydrogen separation became small. The separation of hydrogen in the early stages of the reaction was probably effective to obtain high selectivities of cis-3-hexenal. Without hydrogen permeation, the selectivity of each product could be described as a function of conversion and the effect of temperature was relatively small. On the other hand, the selectivity of cis-3-hexenal with hydrogen separation exhibited a maximum over the temperature range of 443–503K. This phenomena corresponds to the reverse trend of the selectivities of hexanal with temperature. In other words, the selectivities of hexanal decreased from 443 to 473K and increased from 473 to 503K. The optimal conditions to produce cis-3-hexenal can probably be determined by a balance between the reaction rate and the hydrogen permeation rate. The increase in temperature enhances both reaction rate constants and hydrogen permeability as shown in Fig. 2. Hydrogen permeation suppresses both hydrogenation of cis-3-hexenal to hexanal and cis-3-hexen-1-ol to 1-hexanol by removing hydrogen from the reaction field. In lower temperature region, the hydrogenation rate from cis-3-hexenal to hexanal was relatively low and the effect of permeation was large. In this region, the selectivity of cis-3-hexenal increased with increasing temperature because the permeation rate increased with increasing temperature by the increase in permeability. On the other hand, in the high temperature region, the hydrogenation rate from cis-3-hexenal to hexanal was significant and the hydrogen produced by dehydrogenation of cis-3-hexen-1-ol was rapidly consumed, which reduced the amount of hydrogen in the reactor and decreased the hydrogen pressure. As a result, the effect of hydrogen permeation became low and the selectivity of cis-3-hexenal decreased with increasing temperature even the permeability increasing, because the permeation rate was the product of the permeability and the difference of hydrogen pressure as Eq. (4). We evaluated the stability of reactant and product by calculating the equilibrium constant and then equilibrium composition. Isobaric specific heat capacity, standard heat of formation and standard entropy for each compound are required to evaluate the Gibbs free energy. However, the physical properties of cis-3-hexen-1-ol and cis-3-hexenal probably are not known. In this study, we estimated the physical properties of cis-3-hexen-1-ol, cis-3-hexenal, 1-hexanol and hexanal by using method of Benson [23]. The correlated isobaric specific heat as a function of temperature as shown in Table 2 by using the parameters of refs. [23-25]. Further, we used parameters reported by Dean et al. [25] for the calculation of physical properties of hydrogen. After that, we calculated Gibbs free energy of reaction ΔG j for each reaction (j) related species (i) by Eq. (5): (5) Δ G j = ∑ i ν i Δ H f , i ° + ∫ 298 T ∑ i ν i C p , i d T − T ∑ i ν i S i ° + ∫ 298 T ∑ i ν i C p , i T d T where ν i is the stoichiometric coefficient for component i. The equilibrium constant for reaction (j) is expressed as Eq. (6): (6) K j = exp − Δ G j R T The equilibrium constant for hydrogenation decreased and that for dehydrogenation increased with increasing temperature (not shown), which is consistent with the general principle that hydrogenation is exothermic and dehydrogenation is endothermic. The equilibrium compositions were calculated from the equilibrium constants determined for the given conditions. Fig. 6 shows the calculated equilibrium compositions for the range of experimental temperatures. The total pressure was set to 4.56×104 Pa, which was the same as the experimental pressure. The composition of cis-3-hexen-1-ol was below 0.01% and is not shown in Fig. 6. The composition of hexanal decreased and those of the other components increased with increasing temperature. The hexanal was dominant and cis-3-hexenal, 1-hexanol and hydrogen were minor products. This is the same trend as the experimental results, especially without hydrogen separation. The hydrogen separation facilitated the formation of dehydrogenated product, that is, cis-3-hexenal that was the minor compound in the calculated equilibrium."
5,Membrane reactor modeling,"3.3 Membrane reactor modeling We developed a one-dimensional model for the membrane reactor assuming no radial concentration gradients similar to that proposed by Keuler and Lorenzen [17]. The assumptions were as follows: (1) the reactor was operated at isothermal and isobaric conditions for both the reaction side and the permeation side, (2) the reactor was under the plug flow conditions, (3) the membrane permeated hydrogen only, (4) the partial pressure of hydrogen on the permeation side was constant, and (5) uniform catalytic bed. We assumed that reaction rate could be expressed with first-order kinetics with activities given by the partial pressure of each component, because the detailed reaction kinetics for the dehydrogenation of cis-3-hexen-1-ol system on Cu/ZnO catalyst are unavailable. In this system, the reaction rates r j were considered to be reversible and described as follows: (7) r j = k j ∏ i P forward , i − ∏ i P reverse , i K P j where k is the rate constant for the forward direction for reaction a–d in Fig. 4. P forward,i and P reverse,i are partial pressures of compounds (i) related to forward and reverse reactions, respectively. The equilibrium constant, K P j for reaction (j) was calculated as discussed above. The model equation for cis-3-hexen-1-ol, cis-3-hexenal, 1-hexanol and 1-hexanal on the reaction side for membrane reactor can be written as follows: (8) d ( F i / F 0 ) d ( L / L 0 ) = ∑ j r j W F 0 where F i is the flow rate of species i, r j the reaction rate related to compound i, W the weight of catalyst, L the length from the inlet of reactor, L 0 the length of the reactor, and F 0 is the flow rate of a standard species. We used the initial flow rate of cis-3-hexen-1-ol as F 0. For hydrogen, Eq. (8) becomes: (9) d ( F H 2 / F 0 ) d ( L / L 0 ) = ∑ j r j , H 2 W F 0 − L 0 F 0 J where J is the flow rate of hydrogen permeated defined by Eq. (4). In Eq. (9), the (L 0/F 0)J term describes the permeation of hydrogen through the membrane, which was previously determined by hydrogen permeation experiments in this study. For the calculation of hydrogen permeation, we defined the pressure of permeation side being by a factor of 10−4 against atmospheric pressure, because the amount of hydrogen in the permeation side was not evaluated due to very small hydrogen flow rates from permeation side. Further, the amount of hydrogen was probably very small in the view of the hydrogen balance of products. At first, we fit the models to the experimental data at 443K without hydrogen separation. The reaction rate constants were obtained by least-squares fit of the cis-3-hexen-1-ol, cis-3-hexenal, 1-hexanol and hexanal partial pressures. At higher temperatures, the ratio of the reaction rate constant at 443K was assumed to be constant and this value was used at 473 and 503K, because the product selectivities without hydrogen separation depended on the conversion regardless of temperature as shown in Fig. 5. Rate constants at 473 and 503K were determined using least-square analysis. Table 3 shows the rate constants determined and in the form of an Arrhenius type expression. The apparent activation energy was 25.3kJ/mol, which is the same order as standard catalytic reactions. Fig. 7 shows a parity plot of the calculations for all experimental conditions. The yields of cis-3-hexen-1-ol and those of hexanal were obtained over a wide range of values while both cis-3-hexenal and 1-hexanol occur over lower values of the yield. The standard deviations of the yields were 5.47 and 3.31 for the case of with and without hydrogen separation, respectively. The model predicted experimental values well even with the assumptions made. The model could describe the reaction pathway with and without hydrogen separation. This also implies that the equilibrium constants were well estimated because they were applied to evaluate the rate constants of reverse reaction. Fig. 8 shows the calculated selectivities of cis-3-hexenal and hexanal at each conversion against temperature. The selectivity of cis-3-hexenal decreased with increasing conversion and that of hexanal increased. For each conversion, the selectivity of cis-3-hexenal with hydrogen separation was higher than that without hydrogen separation. Without hydrogen separation, the selectivities of both cis-3-hexenal and hexanal were almost constant regardless of temperature. On the other hand, the selectivity of cis-3-hexenal exhibited a maximum at around 473K whereas the selectivity of hexanal became minimum at around 473K. These trends were the same as the experimental results. The model seems to correctly estimate the somewhat complicated behavior of selectivities against temperature, which suggests that the model were valid for describing the decomposition kinetics of unsaturated alcohols with the membrane reactor. Fig. 9 shows the partial pressure of products with dimensionless length along reactor length at 443K for W/F =56 [skg-cat/mol]. Without hydrogen separation, the partial pressure of cis-3-hexen-1-ol decreased and those of hexanal and 1-hexanol increased monotonically from the inlet to the outlet of the reactor. The partial pressure of hydrogen and cis-3-hexenal preferentially increased around the inlet of reactor, and the partial pressure of hydrogen slightly decreased and the magnitude of the increase in partial pressure of cis-3-hexenal decreased above 0.1 of dimensionless length. With hydrogen separation, the partial pressure of cis-3-hexen-1-ol decreased and those of hexanal, cis-3-hexenal and 1-hexanol increased from the inlet to the outlet of the reactor. The partial pressure of hydrogen once increased, and decreased at around 0.1 of dimensionless length corresponded to a significant increase in partial pressure of cis-3-hexenal. The profile of hydrogen pressures in the consecutive reactions was different from reactions for hydrogen production with membrane reactor. The concentration, namely partial pressure of hydrogen became maximum near the inlet of reactor in this study, whereas the concentration of hydrogen monotonically increased with the reactor length from inlet in the case of hydrogen production reactions such as steam reforming of methanol [26]. The hydrogen removal near the inlet of reactor seems to be important for the enhancement of dehydrogenation. The partial pressure of cis-3-hexenal with hydrogen separation was significantly higher than that without hydrogen separation. For example, the partial pressure of cis-3-hexenal at outlet of the reactor was 3.3 and 1.8kPa with and without hydrogen separation, respectively. The partial pressures of 1-hexanol and hydrogen with hydrogen separation were lower than those without hydrogen separation. Here, the difference in partial pressure of hydrogen between with and without hydrogen separation was below only 200Pa. The difference in the partial pressures of hydrogen between with and without hydrogen separation were relatively smaller than those of the partial pressures of cis-3-hexenal between with and without hydrogen permeation. These results indicate that the partial pressure of hydrogen greatly affected the formation of intermediates having both hydrogenated and dehydrogenated position such as cis-3-hexenal for the reaction of unsaturated alcohols. Judging from these results, the hydrogen permeable membrane reactor was effective for controlling the dehydrogenation kinetics of unsaturated alcohols."
6,Conclusions,"The dehydrogenation of cis-3-hexen-1-ol was conducted with palladium membrane reactor from 443 to 503K. The major products were cis-3-hexenal, hexanal and 1-hexanol. The reaction proceeded through a consecutive reaction as follows. The dehydrogenation of cis-3-hexen-1-ol yielded cis-3-hexenal and hydrogen, and then the hydrogenation of both cis-3-hexenal and cis-3-hexen-1-ol lead to the formation of hexanal and 1-hexanol, respectively. After that, the dehydrogenation of 1-hexanol yielded hexanal and hydrogen. The formation of hexanal, that is, final product was dominant in this system. The selectivity of cis-3-hexenal decreased with increasing conversion and that of hexanal increased. Without hydrogen separation, the selectivity could be described as a function of conversion regardless of reaction temperature. Estimation of equilibrium compositions by chemical thermodynamics gave results consistent with the experimental data and showed that the composition of hexanal would be above 99mol%. Experiments with hydrogen separation were conducted by depressurizing the permeate side of membrane reactor. The selectivity of cis-3-hexenal with hydrogen separation was significantly higher than that without hydrogen separation and the selectivity of hexanal with hydrogen permeation was lower than that without hydrogen separation, which is probably because the hydrogen removal from the reaction side suppressed the hydrogenation of cis-3-hexenal. Further, the selectivity of cis-3-hexenal once increased with increasing temperature and then decreased, which corresponded to the reverse trend in the selectivity of hexanal. The increase in temperature enhanced both hydrogen permeation rate and dehydrogenation and hydrogenation rates. The balance of reaction rate and hydrogen permeation rate should be an important factor to control the formation of intermediates. A one-dimensional reaction model was proposed for this system that could correlate experimental yields and trends of product selectivities with temperature. In a palladium membrane reactor, the hydrogen partial pressure greatly affects the formation of intermediates such as cis-3-hexenal. Consequently, the hydrogen separation with palladium membrane reactor was effective to produce unsaturated aldehyde by the dehydrogenation of unsaturated alcohols. This means that the controlling hydrogen pressure with hydrogen permeable membrane reactors can be an effective method for the selective organic synthesis."
