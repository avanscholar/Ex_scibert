0,Introduction,"Nowadays, the main resources of energy and fuels are petroleum, natural gas and coal; however, energy extraction from these conventional fuels is considered one of the major causes of environmental deterioration, due mainly to emissions of greenhouse gases by burning these fuels. On the other hand, the global energy demand is increasing continuously due to the rapid growth in population and industrialization development. A secure and accessible supply of energy is crucial for the sustainability of modern societies, developed or emerging economies. In this context, the reduction of global warming while satisfying growing energy demands is the one of the most important challenges to face in this 21st century [1–3]. According to Escobar et al. [4], the transportation sector alone accounts for about 47% of total primary energy consumed in the world and development of sustainable fuels in the transportation sector has attracted the worldwide attention, especially those derived from biomass [5]. This is illustrated by the exponential growth of scientific publications on biofuels in the past decade [6]. Recently, Román-Leshkov et al. [7] developed an efficient two-step catalytic process that can convert fructose into 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), a potential liquid biofuel. The raw material used in this proposed hybrid process route has the main advantage that can be obtained from biomass, directly or derived from glucose. According to Román-Leshkov et al. [7], DMF exhibits suitable physical properties for liquid fuels useful in transportation sector: unlike ethanol, the only renewable liquid fuel currently produced in large quantities, which suffers from several limitations, including low energy density, high volatility, and contamination by the absorption of water from the atmosphere, DMF has a 40% higher energy density and a 20K higher boiling point compared to ethanol, is chemically stable, is not water soluble and its evaporation requires approximately one-third less energy than the evaporation of ethanol. In addiction, the Research Octane Number (RON) is comparable to the gasoline and ethanol RON [8]. Since DMF potential as a promising new biofuel and fuel additive was highlighted, many researchers had investigated about the combustion performance and characteristics of DMF and fuel blends including DMF [8–21]. The results indicate that DMF can be easily adopted to current DISI technologies, because it has similar combustion characteristics and emissions to gasoline [21]. In the process of DMF production proposed by Román-Leshkov et al. [7], the final steps involve the separation of the biofuel from the extraction solvent used in the dehydration of fructose to form HMF [5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural] in the biphasic reactor and reaction intermediates, like water produced in hydrogenolysis reaction [7]. Various solvents are tested in the HMF production in biphasic reactor, among them 1-butanol, 2-butanol and 1-hexanol [7,22]. For design, operation and optimization of this process, thermophysical properties and phase equilibrium data, such as vapor–liquid and liquid–liquid equilibrium, are essential. The main goal of this work is to perform new measurements of thermophysical properties of pure DMF, such as density, refractive index and dynamic viscosity, as well as to investigate experimental liquid–liquid equilibrium of ternary systems involving water+2,5-dimethylfuran+alcohol (1-butanol or 2-butanol or 1-hexanol). A survey of the literature shows that only vapor–liquid equilibrium of binary systems containing DMF were measured [23–27] and that no LLE data including DMF are available."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials DMF and alcohols were used as purchased from the suppliers, without further purification. Distillated water was used throughout all experiments. The chemicals used in this work and their chemical abstracts registry number (CAS number), suppliers and the purities provided by their respective suppliers are included in Table 1 . Experimental and reference values reported in the literature for liquid density (ρ) and refractive index (nD ) of the pure compounds used at 298.2K also are included in Table 1."
3,Apparatus and procedure,"2.2 Apparatus and procedure For pure liquid properties determination, a vibrating U-tube Anton-Paar DMA 5000 densimeter (accuracy of ±5×10−6 gcm−3) was used for density measurements, whereas refractive index measurements were made by using a Mettler-Toledo RE 40 D refractometer (±0.0001). Dynamic viscosities (η) were determined using a falling ball viscometer Anton-Paar AMVn (±1×10−4 mPas). In order to determine the most suitable analytical methodology for determination of experimental liquid–liquid equilibrium data for these systems including DMF, three analytical methodologies were tested. Technique 1 uses densimetry and refratometry by using calibration curves obtained in binodal curves experiments, as described by Oliveira and Aznar [31]; technique 2 uses gas chromatography to determine both DMF and solvent concentration, while water content is obtained by mass balance, as described by Mafra and Krähenbühl [32]; and technique 3 uses gas chromatography to determine both DMF and solvent concentration, while water concentration is determined by Karl Fischer volumetric titration. Due to the low solubility of DMF in water-rich phase, the technique 1 was considered not suitable, because the visualization of the cloud point was not very clear and large uncertainties in mass fraction and density measurements were obtained. On the other hand, technique 2 presented large uncertainties for water content in organic phase. For some tie-lines, water content was very low; in these cases, the chromatographic response indicates a sum of DMF and solvent mass fractions lightly greater than 1, therefore the water content obtained was lower than 0. The most successful technique among the three cited was the technique 3, therefore this technique will be described in detail hereafter. The LLE ternary data was determined by using a 23cm3 jacketed glass cell, similar to those designed by Stragevitch [33] and described elsewhere [34]. The overall mixtures were prepared directly into the cells and the components were weighted in analytical balance Shimadzu AS200 (accuracy of ±1×10−4 g). The cell temperature was maintained constant at T =298.2K (±0.1K) or T =313.2K (±0.1K), controlled by the recirculation of water through the external jacket from a Tecnal TE-184 thermostatic bath. The mixtures were vigorously stirred for 1h by using a Fisatom 752 magnetic stirrer, in order to allow a close contact between the phases, after which they were left to settle for at least 12h, until the phases were completely separated and clear. Preliminary tests showed that this time was enough to achieve the equilibrium. After the equilibrium was reached, samples of both phases were carefully collected by plastic syringes, avoiding the disturbance of the equilibrium. The collected samples were analyzed in order to determine the equilibrium compositions. The water mass fraction of each phase was determined directly by using a Karl Fischer volumetric titration with a Mettler Toledo DL31 titrator (accurate to ±1×10−4% of water). The organic compounds mass fractions were determined by gas chromatography (GC) using a Varian 3400 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a SBPTM-1 megabore column (poly(dimethyl siloxane), 15m×3.2×10−4 m×5×10−6 m film thickness) and using nitrogen as the carrier gas and synthetic air and hydrogen to burn the flame. The injector temperature was set to 200°C. The column temperature was maintained constant (50°C) for 5min and next raised at 5°C/min until 70°C; after that, it was raised at 30°C/min until 100°C; at last, this temperature was maintained constant for 2min. The detector temperature was set to 250°C. The flow rate of nitrogen was 10mL/min, with a makeup of 80mL/min, while the flow rate of synthetic air and hydrogen were 300mL/min and 18mL/min, respectively. These temperatures and flow rates were selected after several tests; under these conditions, a perfect separation of the response peaks for all components was obtained. All measurements were performed at least in triplicate. The detector was calibrated using the area normalization method. A calibration curve was made for each system, with different concentrations of binary mixtures of the organic compounds presents in each system {DMF+(1-butanol or 2-butanol or 1-hexanol)}, covering the range from a diluted mixture in DMF to diluted mixture in alcohol, each one at least in triplicate. From these calibration curves, the mass fraction ratio of the organic compounds as a function of their respective chromatographic peak areas ratio was obtained. The calibration curves were validated by analyzing solutions with known composition. The same procedure was applied to determine the mutual solubility of binary systems water+DMF and water+alcohols, except that the composition analysis was performed only by using Karl Fischer titration; since the water mass fraction in the equilibrium phase was already determined, the composition of the other component was calculated satisfying the mass balance constraint: (1) ∑ i w i = 1 where wi is the mass fraction of each component. The estimated uncertainties on mass fraction measurement were 0.001, with the largest uncertainties for aqueous phase. The temperature was estimated to be accurate to within ±0.10K."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Pure DMF properties,"3.1 Pure DMF properties A survey of the literature shows that available experimental properties for pure DMF are very scarce. Among the few reported data available are density [24,36], vapor pressure [23,24,36], interfacial tension [24], heat capacity [35,36], melting point [37], standard molar enthalpies of vaporization and formation [35] and some thermodynamic functions [36] measurements. Estimated critical properties also were found in the literature [37–39]. Considering that the knowledge of several physical properties of pure compounds or their mixtures, including density, refractive index and viscosity are very important for design and optimization of industrial process, some basic measurements of densities, refractive indexes and dynamic viscosities were made in order to make reliable data on these properties available. Particularly, densities and viscosities are important fuel parameters, subject to specifications and impact on the fuel quality. Table 2 reports the new density, refractive indexes and viscosities experimental values as function of the temperature. It can be observed that both properties decrease with the temperature. The obtained densities values were compared with the experimental data reported by Mejía et al. [24] and those which can be predicted from the equation and parameters suggested by Yaws [37]. For liquids densities, Yaws suggests an equation with this form: (2) ρ = AB - 1 - T C n where ρ is the density, expressed as gcm−3, A, B, C and n are the equation parameters and T is the temperature in K. For DMF, the Yaws proposed values are: A =0.31363; B =0.27562; C =557.13 and n =0.28571, valid within the temperature range between 210.4 and 557.1K. New values were estimated in this work, and the new values are reported in Table 3 . In Fig. 1 , a good agreement between the present density data and those reported by Mejía et al. [24] can be observed, with an average absolute percentage deviation less than 0.02%. Predicted values, using Yaws parameters and Eq. (2), present an average absolute percentage deviation of 1.28% respect to the experimental data reported in Table 2. The experimental values for densities obtained in this work and those reported by Mejía et al. [24] were fitted to the Eq. (2) and the new values for the parameters of this equation are presented in Table 3. The experimental results for refractive indexes were fitted to the linear Eq. (3) and the experimental results for viscosity have been smoothed using Eq. (4), known as Vogel equation [40]. (3) n D = A + BT (4) ln η = A + B T + C In these equations, A, B and C are numerical parameters and T is the temperature in K. The parameters of Eqs. (2)–(4), as well the correlation statistics, are summarized in Table 3. Experimental results and correlation for refractive indexes and dynamic viscosities are depicted in Figs. 2 and 3 , respectively."
6,Liquid–liquid equilibrium,"3.2 Liquid–liquid equilibrium The experimental tie-line compositions of the equilibrium phases for the three ternary systems {water+DMF+(1-butanol or 2-butanol or 1-hexanol)} are listed in Tables 4–6 and the LLE diagrams for these ternary systems are plotted in Figs. 4–6 . As expected, these ternary systems behave as type-2 LLE [41], since (water+DMF) and (water+solvent) mixtures pairs are partially miscible and the only liquid pair that is completely miscible is (DMF+solvent). Therefore, these systems do not present a plat point. As seen from the phase diagrams, it is easy to see that the selected alcohols are good solvents for use in the DMF production process, with large two-phase regions. The immiscibility region and the equilibrium characteristics of the investigated systems are influenced by the alcohol used as solvent; the immiscibility region decreases in the same order than the mutual solubility of water and the alcohol decreases: 1-hexanol>1-butanol>2-butanol. The selectivity (S) of DMF, defined as the ratio of distribution coefficients of DMF (2) to water (1), was calculated in order to evaluate the extracting characteristics of DMF. The selectivity is mathematically expressed by (5) S = w 2 I / w 2 II w 1 I / w 1 II = D 2 D 1 where D 1 and D 2 are the distribution coefficients of water and DMF, respectively; w 1 I and w 2 I represent the mass fractions of water and DMF in the organic phase, respectively, and w 1 II and w 2 II are the mass fractions of water and DMF in the aqueous phase, respectively. These parameters, selectivity and distribution coefficient for the studied ternary system, are also presented in Tables 4–6, and the variation of the experimental selectivity as a function of the mass fraction of DMF in the aqueous phase is shown in Fig. 7 . For all investigated systems, the experimental results indicate that DMF have high selectivity values, thereby indicating the ability of this compound to spontaneously separate from water due its hydrophobic nature, as remarked by Román-Leshkov et al. [7]. It can be observed that, in aqueous phase, the concentration of DMF is very small over the complete two-phase region for all studied systems, less than 0.2%, implying in a high recovery of the DMF produced in the hydrogenolysis step. However, the mass fraction of water in the organic phase is significant for low concentrations of DMF, mainly in systems containing the C4 alcohols, reaching about 20% in the system containing 1-butanol and about 35% in the system containing 2-butanol. For the system containing 1-hexanol, the maximum mass fraction of water in organic phase is about 7%. Despite this observation, the choice of the solvent to be used in the DMF production process should take into account other factors, such as final fuel quality requirements, energy and costs required for the subsequent separation steps and nature of the solvent. For example, 1-butanol is an advantageous solvent for biomass application, because it can be produced by the fermentation of biomass-derived carbohydrates, whereas 2-butanol and other extracting solvent that can generate high HMF selectivity are obtained from petroleum-derived products [7]. Furthermore, 1-butanol is also considered an attractive biofuel candidate [42] and the possibility of a DMF/1-butanol blend as a biofuel should be considered and investigated. The experimental data for each ternary system were correlated using the NRTL [43] and UNIQUAC [44] models for the activity coefficient. The NRTL model is given by: (6) ln γ i = ∑ j τ ji G ji x j ∑ k G ki x k + ∑ j x j G ij ∑ k G kj x k τ ij - ∑ k x k τ kj G ki ∑ k G kj x k (7) τ ij = Δ g ij RT = a ij T ( τ ij ≠ τ ji ) (8) G ij = exp ( - α ij τ ij ) ( α ij = α ji ) where subscripts i, j, k denote each component in the mixture and x the mole fractions. This model has three adjustable parameters for each binary pair (aij , aji and αij ). The parameters aij and aji are related to the characteristic energy of interaction between molecules of type i and j, while the parameter αij is related to the non-randomness of the mixture. In this work, αij was fixed at 0.2 for all binary pairs. The UNIQUAC model is given by: (9) ln γ i = ln Φ i ∗ x i + z 2 q i ln θ i Φ i ∗ + l i - Φ i ∗ x i ∑ j x j l j - q i ln ∑ j θ j τ ji + q i - q i ∑ j θ j ∑ k θ k τ kj where Φ i ∗ and θi are the volume and surface area fractions, given by: (10) Φ i ∗ = r i x i ∑ j r j x j (11) θ i = q i x i ∑ j q j x j Parameters ri and qi are the structural pure component volume and surface area parameters, respectively. These structural parameters are shown in Table 7 for all studied components. The values for DMF were calculated in this work according to the method of Bondi [45]; the values for all others components were taken from literature [46]. The coordination number z is fixed as 10 and the lj term is given by: (12) l j = z 2 ( r j - q j ) - ( r j - 1 ) The energy interactions parameters are τ ij e τ ji , which are expressed as: (13) τ ij = exp - Δ u ij RT ≡ exp - a ij T The estimation of parameters aij and aji for both models was performed by using the FORTRAN code TML-LLE 2.0 [33]; the procedure is based on the modified Simplex method [47] by minimizing the square of the differences between the experimental and calculated mole fractions for each component of both liquid phases for each ternary system, using the objective function F [48]: (14) F = ∑ k D ∑ j M ∑ i N - 1 x ijk I , exp - x ijk I , calc 2 + x ijk II , exp - x ijk II , calc 2 where D, M, and N indicate the number of data sets, tie-lines and components for each system, respectively. Superscripts I and II denote each equilibrium phase and exp and calc refer to experimental and calculated values, respectively. The estimated parameters for both NRTL and UNIQUAC models are reported in Table 8 . The root mean square deviation (δw ) between the experimental and calculated phase composition, expressed as mass fraction, was calculated according to: (15) δ w = 100 ∑ i M ∑ j N w ijk I , exp - w ijk I , calc 2 + w ijk I , exp - w ijk I , calc 2 2 MN The root mean square deviations for all systems are shown, for both models, in Table 9 . In Figs. 8–13 , the experimental LLE data are compared with NRTL and UNIQUAC correlations. It can be observed that the experimental and calculated data are in excellent agreement. The global deviations were below 1% for both models."
7,Reliability of tie-line data,"3.3 Reliability of tie-line data The reliability of the experimental tie-line was ascertained by applying Bachman [49] and Othmer–Tobias [50] correlation equations, given by Eqs. (16) and (17), respectively: (16) w 3 I = A B + B B w 3 I w 1 II (17) ln 1 - w 3 I w 3 I = A OT + B OT ln 1 - w 1 II w 1 II where w 1 II is the mass fraction of water in the aqueous phase and w 3 I is the mass fraction of the alcohols in the organic phase. AB and BB are the Bachman correlation parameters, while AOT and BOT are the Othmer–Tobias correlation parameters. The regressed parameters and the linear regression R-squared (RSQ) are listed in Table 10. Good linear correlation coefficients were determined for these three ternary systems applying both correlations, particularly for Bachman correlation, with R-squared greater than 0.99 for all systems."
8,Conclusion,"Densities, refractive indexes and dynamic viscosities for pure 2,5-dimethylfuran and ternary liquid–liquid equilibrium data for three systems including this green next-generation biofuel were experimentally determined. The LLE data have not been previously reported in literature and this work contributes with new values for the mentioned pure DMF properties, some of which were not available in open literature. The investigated ternary systems were {water+DMF+(1-butanol or 2-butanol or 1-hexanol)} at 298.2K and 313.2K at atmospheric pressure. A type II behavior was found for all systems. Selectivity and distribution coefficients for DMF were calculated and the results show the ability of this compound spontaneously separate from water. The studied systems also show large two-phase region. The experimental LLE data were correlated using the NRTL and UNIQUAC models for activity coefficient and a good correlation was obtained, with a RMDS of less than 1% for all systems. The Bachman and Othmer–Tobias correlations were used to ascertain the reliability of the experimental data and the results are satisfactory. Therefore, from the viewpoint of extraction process, it can be concluded that the studied alcohols are reliable organic solvents for use in DMF biomass-to-liquid two-step catalytic process production."
