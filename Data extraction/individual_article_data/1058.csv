0,Introduction,"Traditional coal chemical production is characterized by low energy efficiency and high CO2 emission. The hydrogen-to-carbon (H/C) ratio of coal is about 4:5, while those of methanol, olefins, liquid fuels, and natural gas, which are chemical products of coal, are about 2:1, 2:1, 2:1, and 3:1, respectively [1,2]. The mismatch between carbon and hydrogen elements in coal and chemical products leads to carbon redundancy and high CO2 emission in coal conversion to chemicals. For example, in the coal-to-methanol (CTM) process, the H/C ratio of coal gasified gas is about 0.7, while that of synthesized methanol is about 2.0. Therefore, the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction is needed to convert CO into H2. More than 50% of the carbon is converted into CO2 through the WGS reaction, and is emitted into the atmosphere, which results in a waste of carbon resources and high CO2 emission [3,4]. For the CTM process, the energy efficiency is about 45%, and the CO2 emission per ton of methanol is 3.8–4.3 ton [5,6]. The CO2 capture and storage (CCS), which includes CO2 capture, compression, transportation, and storage, is considered a feasible measure to achieve large-scale CO2 emission reduction. However, the use of CCS to reduce CO2 emission faces the problem of high energy consumption, which further reduces the process energy efficiency and increases cost. For example, the cost of CO2 emission reduction for most coal-fired power plants is 28.57–50 US$/t CO2 [7], which is much higher than the current carbon tax. The capture CO2 stored in geological formation is a way of carbon sequestration. However, in the life cycle of CCS, CO2 transportation and storage stages consume amount of fuels and electricity, these will lead to large amount of indirect CO2 emission. In addition, natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis will accelerate the leak of the stored CO2. Chinese government promises the domestic CO2 emission intensity will be reduced by 40%–45% in 2020 and 60%–65% in 2030 based on the domestic GDP in 2005, and the emission peak should be reached in 2030 [8]. Therefore, a low-carbon strategy is important for clean development of coal-to-chemical processes. In coal-to-chemical processes, the conversion of redundant carbon into carbon intermediates or chemicals will result in the highly efficient and clean utilization of carbon resources. Some researchers had investigated the reaction mechanism of CO2 and H2 and proposed concepts of the synthesis of chemicals (e.g., methanol, natural gas, and dimethyl ether) from CO2 and H2 where hydrogen is produced by renewable power and electrolytic water [9–13]. Shih et al. [14] also proposed the concept of “liquid sunshine,” the use of solar energy, CO2, and water to synthesize green liquid fuels. Grossmann et al. [15] proposed the concept of the integration of renewable energy sources and established a superstructure framework for the production of ethanol, methanol, liquid fuels, and heat energy by coupling of solar energy, wind energy, and biomass. Gonçalves et al. [16] investigated a novel technology which is electrochemistry-based process in order to generate synthetic fuels from liquefied biomass. It was found that the most favorable results were obtained for the biomass test at 300 °C, together with 4% of acidified zeolite Y catalyst. Moreover, the renewable hydrogen value chain can also have synergies with the bioenergy value chain, with biomass being used to produce biohydrogen. In the recent 20 years, researchers had been interested in the direct hydrogenation of CO2 to produce carbon-based chemical products, such as methanol, dimethyl ether, formic acid, and higher alcohols [17,18]. To provide more active sites of CO2, Cu-based catalysts were mostly supported by redox or oxygen-deficient carriers, such as ZnO, ZrO2, and TiO2 [19–22]. Wang et al. [23] developed a bimetallic solid solution oxide catalyst ZnO–ZrO2, which was different from the traditional metal catalyst. In this study, when the one-way conversion of CO2 exceeded 10%, the methanol selectivity was still about 90%. However, the direct hydrogenation of CO2 requires a large amount of hydrogen, in which H/C ratio is about 3:1, and the hydrogen cost becomes one of the key factors restricting the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. The technical routes of hydrogen production from fossil energy mainly include coal gasification, natural gas reforming, and methane pyrolysis. In these routes, the WGS is also required to convert CO into CO2 and H2. Therefore, hydrogen production from fossil fuels still features high carbon emission, which does not solve the problem of high carbon emission from the source [24]. There are three main methods of hydrogen production from non-fossil energy: water electrolysis, biomass hydrogen production, and solar energy conversion. Water electrolysis is one of the promising methods for large-scale green hydrogen production; however, water electrolysis system consumes large amount of electricity. Conventional electricity produced from fossil fuels will definitely cause resources waste and environmental pollution. Renewable energy power is a clean and feasible method to provide power for water electrolysis for production of green hydrogen. China has achieved remarkable progress in exploring and utilizing renewable energy power technologies. Renewable energy power includes solar photovoltaic (PV), wind power, biomass power, hydropower and so on, as shown in Fig. 1 [25]. In Fig. 1, renewable power capacity increases rapidly from 2015 to 2019 in China. The hydropower is the dominant in renewable source power generation; in addition, the development of wind power and solar PV is rapid. However, the price of renewable energy power is relatively high. As shown in Fig. 2 [26], compared with the current coal-fired power (0.036–0.065 US$/kWh), almost every renewable power has higher price except for hydropower. The price of renewable energy power is the key restricted component for green hydrogen production. It is believed that the renewable power cost will be fallen sharply with the Chinese government's financial support and renewable power technological development. For example, by 2035 and 2050, it is estimated that the price of solar PV will be reduced to about 0.029 US$/kWh and 0.019 US$/kWh, respectively [27]. This paper takes the CTM as a case study, to solve the problem of large CO2 emission, the CO2 in the shifted gas is captured and hydrogenated to produce methanol, instead of being directly emitted or stored in geological formations. This paper presents a process that integrates renewable energy power for green hydrogen production (GH) with the CTM process. This novel process, called GH-CTM, includes the traditional CTM process, a renewable energy power system, a power-to-hydrogen (PTH) unit, and a methanol synthesis and distillation unit. Moreover, the oxygen produced from the electrolysis of water can be used in coal gasification; this approach avoids the use of large-scale air separation equipment, which is costly and consumes a large amount of energy. The integrated process can not only produce chemicals but also reduce CO2 emission. In this study, Aspen Plus is used to model and simulate the CTM process and the integrated process. The key operational parameters of the reactor for carbon dioxide direct hydrogenation to methanol are analyzed and optimized to increase the process techno-economic performance, and the entire novel process is simulated to realize mass and energy balance on the basis of key operational parameters. Furthermore, the two processes are analyzed and compared in terms of energy efficiency, CO2 emission, and economic performance."
1,Process modeling and optimization,"In this work, the coal-to-methanol scale was referred to Shenhua project of 1.8 Mt/y methanol production, and about 2.87 Mt/y raw coal was consumed. Annual production time was set as 8000 h, 230.12 t/h methanol production were obtained, while 358.295 t/h raw coal were consumed. Yanzhou coal was selected as the raw material [28]."
2,CTM with CCS process,"2.1 CTM with CCS process The flow diagram of the CTM with CCS (CTMCCS) process is displayed in Fig. 3 . As the basis of the techno-economic analysis, major units of a CTM process were modeled, including air separation, coal gasification, acid gas removal, CCS, WGS reaction, methanol synthesis, and methanol distillation units. The flowsheet of the CTMCCS process is displayed in Fig. 4 [29,30]. The modeling details are described in the following sections. 2.1.1 Air separation In the modeling, an air separation unit was used to produce high-purity oxygen and nitrogen. Oxygen was used for coal gasification, and N2 was used for acid gas purification. Cryogenic separation technology was adopted for the air separation unit because it was commonly used for modern large-scale air separation, and high-purity N2 and O2 can be obtained; however, the investment and energy consumption of cryogenic separation technology are high [30]. The thermodynamic method was selected as the PR-BM [31]. 2.1.2 Coal gasification In the coal gasification, Texaco gasification technology was adopted. The results of the industrial analysis and elemental analysis of the raw coal used in the gasification process modeling are presented in Table 1 . In addition, the components of raw coal in Aspen Plus were defined as unconventional components. HCOALGEN was adopted for the enthalpy model, and DCCOALIGN was adopted for the density model [32]. The coal water slurry was fed into the gasification process, and it reacted with oxygen from the air separation unit to produce crude synthesis gas. In the modeling, the coal gasification was assumed to comprise two independent separate processes: the pyrolysis process and the gasification process, which used the RYield reactor to separate coal into C, H2, N2, O2, S, and ash. The main reactions in the coal gasification process are expressed below [33]: (1) C + H2O → CO + H2 ΔH = +131.4 kJ/mol, (2) CO + H2O → CO2 + H2 ΔH = −42 kJ/mol, (3) C + CO2 → 2CO ΔH = +172.6 kJ/mol, (4) C + 2H2 → CH4 ΔH = −75 kJ/mol, (5) CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O ΔH = −890.3 kJ/mol For the gasification process modeling, the RGibbs model was adopted, which uses the Gibbs free energy minimization method. The physical property method was selected as the PR model, and the O2/coal ratio was set to about 0.88. 2.1.3 Acid gas removal Crude synthesis gas contains a large amount of harmful impurities such as sulfide and the large amount of CO2 generated by the WGS reaction unit; thus, it does not meet the reaction condition and environmental protection requirements. The Rectisol process, which operates at low temperatures, is widely used in syngas purification due to its high efficiency and low cost. After absorbed by methanol and desorbed in the desorption tower, CO2 is stored in the geological layer. The CCS system includes carbon capture, compression, transportation, and storage. For modeling, the RadFrac model was used to simulate the acid gas absorber, the desorber, the H2S concentration tower, and the regenerator. The physical property method was selected as the PSRK model [30]. 2.1.4 Methanol synthesis and distillation I For the methanol synthesis modeling, a Lurgi synthesis reactor was used and modeled using the Requil model in Aspen Plus. The Cu–Zn–Al catalyst was used for this reaction, at a suitable temperature of 513 K and pressure of 8.2 MPa [34,35]. The main equilibrium reactions (6 and 7) lead to methanol and water: (6) CO + 2H2 → CH3OH ΔH298K = −90.77 kJ/mol, (7) CO2 + 3H2 → CH3OH + H2O ΔH298K = −49.16 kJ/mol The clean syngas was fed into the methanol synthesis unit as the feedstock. Following the synthesis reaction, the unreacted syngas was separated out from the chemical products and recycled back to the methanol synthesis unit to increase the methanol production. The PR and NRTL model were selected as the thermodynamic methods for methanol synthesis and distillation unit ([35]; Cui et al., 2017). The RadFrac model was used to simulate the separation columns, in addition, double-effect distillation was adopted for the crude methanol rectification. The pressures of the high-pressure column and low-pressure tower were set to 0.7 MPa and 0.1 MPa, respectively. The key operational parameters of the CTM process are presented in Table 2 ."
3,GH-CTM process,"2.2 GH-CTM process The major units of the novel GH-CTM process were modeled, and this process include a renewable energy power generation system, power-to-hydrogen (PTH) unit, and CO2 hydrogenation to methanol system. The GH-CTM process diagram is displayed in Fig. 5 . For the novel process, the PTH unit generates hydrogen, which is mixed with CO2 from the CTM process to the stoichiometric number (SN) value of 2.10–2.15; this SN is optimized in this study, as described in Section 2.3. CO2 from the CTM process is converted into methanol, rather than sequestered through the CCS process. The process flowsheet of the GH-CTM process is shown in Fig. 6 [29,30]. ∗ Methanol synthesis I - the methanol synthesis via syngas, Methanol synthesis II - methanol synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation, Methanol distillation I - syngas crude methanol distillation, Methanol distillation II - distillation of methanol synthesized via CO2 hydrogenation. 2.2.1 Renewable energy power The energy consumption for the production of hydrogen is provided by renewable energy power, including wind power, solar PV, hydropower, nuclear power and so on. The instability of renewable energy power generation influence operation steady and smooth, therefore, the implementation of a hybrid energy system is adopted to decrease the volatility and periodicity of renewable energy power in this article, moreover, batteries is used for power storage, and then the power is used for the water-electrolysis hydrogen-production unit. The key parameters of the battery are presented in Table 3 . 2.2.2 Power-to-hydrogen The PTH equation is presented as follows: (8) H2O + Electricity → H2 (g) + 0.5O2 (g). According to electrochemical principles, the hydrogen production rate by the electrolysis of water is proportional to the electric current. There will be parasitic electric current loss during the water electrolysis process; therefore, the actual hydrogen production rate of the electrolyzer can be expressed as: (9) q H 2 = η F n c I elec 2 F Here, q H2 represents the rate of hydrogen production, mol/s, and η F represents electric current density. The flowsheet of the PTH process is shown in Fig. 7 . Demineralized water is heated, vaporized, and superheated as raw material for the cathode reaction. To avoid the oxidation of the electrolytic material Ni-YSZ, a certain amount of H2 (10 vol%) is usually added to the raw material gas, and the electrolytic conversion rate of the reaction raw material is as high as 85%–90% [43]. The hydrogen-rich gas produced by electrolysis is water-cooled to remove water from the flash tank, and a part of the dry mixture was recycled to the cathode. The remaining gas is compressed to the pressure swing adsorption unit to produce 99.999 vol% hydrogen. The oxygen purged from the anode supplies oxygen to the coal gasification unit, which can avoid the use of oxygen storage equipment and air separation equipment. The water-electrolysis hydrogen-production unit uses alkaline electrolyzers, which are characterized by low cost, mature technology, and large-scale industrial applications. The thermodynamic method was selected as the RK-Soave [44]. The key operational parameters of the electrolyzer are presented in Table 4 . 2.2.3 Methanol synthesis and distillation II The hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of methanol synthesized from syngas is 2, while that of methanol synthesized via CO2 hydrogenation is 3. In a process having all three components (CO2, CO, and H2) in the feed, the components mole fractions have to be adjusted such that the optimal SN is 2.10–2.15. The SN is calculated as follows: (10) SN= (H2–CO2)/(CO + CO2) = 2.10–2.15. After being compressed to the reaction pressure condition using a multi-compressor, CO2 and hydrogen are fed into the methanol synthesis reactor II. The methanol synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation uses fibrous Cu/Zn/Al/Zr catalyst [46] and involves the following three main chemical reactions: reaction A (eq. (6)), B (eq. (11)), and C (eq. (7)): (11) CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O ΔH298K = +41.21 kJ/mol Reaction B is an endothermic reaction; hence, the temperature increase favors equilibrium. However, reactions A and C are exothermic; hence the temperature increase has a negative impact on equilibrium. Thus, higher methanol yields are obtained at lower temperatures and higher pressures. The reaction equilibrium constants KA, KB, and KC were obtained from the research by Lim et al. [47]; and the experimental data of Graaf et al. [48] were used. The equilibrium constant data in the literature agree well with the equilibrium constant calculated by Aspen Plus using the equilibrium reactor. The equations for calculating the equilibrium constant are as follows: (12) L n K A = − 52.096 + 11840 T (13) L n K B = 5.639 − 5285 T (14) L n K C = − 46.457 + 6555 T The plug model was used to simulate the methanol synthesis reactor II. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics were used for the methanol synthesis reaction. The kinetics model is expressed as eq. (15)–(17) [46]. The kinetic data are presented in Table 5 : (15) r CH 3 OH = k A K CO [ f CO f H 2 3 / 2 − f CH 3 OH / K A f H 2 ] ( 1 + K CO f CO + K CO 2 f CO 2 ) [ f H 2 + ( K H 2 O / K H 2 ) f H 2 O ] (16) r CO = k B K CO 2 [ f CO 2 f H 2 − f H 2 O f CO / K B ] ( 1 + K CO f CO + K CO 2 f CO 2 ) [ f H 2 + ( K H 2 O / K H 2 ) f H 2 O ] (17) r CH 3 OH = k C K CO 2 [ f CO 2 f H 2 3 / 2 − f H 2 O f CH 3 OH / ( f H 2 3 / 2 K C ) ] ( 1 + K CO f CO + K CO 2 f CO 2 ) [ f H 2 + ( K H 2 O / K H 2 ) f H 2 O ] The multi-tubular catalytic reactor has the following characteristics: 12 m length, 4200 tubes of 0.06 m diameter, and a loading of 32000 kg catalyst (Cu/Zn/Al/Zr). A bed voidage of 0.98 was used in simulations. The methanol synthesis based on CO2 conversion was rigorously simulated using the RK-Soave property model, and the NRTL model was used for methanol distillation [49]; Cui et al., 2017). The experiment and simulation results are compared in Table 6 . The output product of synthesis reactor II contains a large amount of unreacted feed gas. First, the output stream is cooled to 30 °C and then separated into two phases by a high-pressure separation tank. The liquid phase flows out from the bottom of the high-pressure separation tank and then enters the low-pressure separation tank after the pressure is reduced to 1.2 bar through a valve. The gases that flow out from the high-pressure separation tank and low-pressure separation tank are mixed. The gas leaving from the low-pressure separation tank is compressed to 50 bar (reaction pressure), and 99% of the flow is recycled back to the methanol synthesis unit, and 1% of the flow is removed. The liquid stream from the low-pressure separation tank is preheated (85 °C) and fed into distillation unit II. The distillation column was modeled considering 60 number of stages with pressure equal to the atmospheric pressure at the condenser, and the pressure drop of stages was set to 0.0068 atm. Then, to produce methanol with 99.9% purity, a mechanical separator was added to the plant."
4,Operational parameters analysis,"2.3 Operational parameters analysis To increase the yield of methanol product and the conversion of the feed gas, as well as the techno-economic performance of the GH-CTM process, several key parameters of reactor II were investigated and optimized in this study. The effects of the catalyst bed temperature(T), reaction pressure(P), gas hourly space velocity (GHSV), and SN on the molar flow of all components and methanol yield are illustrated in Fig. 8 (a), (b), (c), and (d). T significantly influenced the methanol yield due to kinetic limitations at lower temperatures and equilibrium limitations at higher temperatures. The methanol yield first increased as the T increased and was reached to the highest (16.2%) when T was 250 °C, and at this temperature, the CO2 conversion ratio reached to 23.61%. As T continued to rise, the molar flow of CO increased due to the reaction B was endothermic, while the methanol yield decreased. Therefore, T was suggested to be 250 °C, as shown in Fig. 8(a). The methanol yield increased as P increased, due to CO2 and CO hydrogenation reactions were a decrease of the total number of moles; however, considering the equipment strength and investment costs, P was chosen as 50 bar, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The CO2 conversion rate and methanol yield were decreased with the increase of the GHSV; while the increase of catalyst loading which meant the decrease of the GHSV leaded to an increase of methanol yield. But the change extent of methanol yield with the GHSV change was not significant. To avoid wasting catalyst, 5.9 m3/kgcat·h was suggested as the GHSV value in this paper, which was the same as that in Kiss et al. [49]; as shown in Fig. 8(c). The SN was generally in the range of 2.10–2.15. As shown in Fig. 8(d), the methanol yield increased slightly with increase of the SN, and the H2 demand also increased; In addition, high SN leaded to large amounts of unreacted hydrogen recycled to methanol synthesis reactor, and the power consumption transported recycle gas was increased. Therefore, a higher SN was not suggested in this paper and SN was chosen to 2.10."
5,Simulation results,"The mass balance of the CTMCCS process was calculated, and the results are presented in Table 7 . The simulation results show that 358.30 t/h coal consumed 9840.10 kmol/h O2 to produce 36359 kmol/h crude syngas in the coal gasification. After the WGS reaction, 7045.41 kmol/h CO, 17330.96 kmol/h H2, and 11901.85 kmol/h CO2 were obtained. After the Rectisol process, 9153.20 kmol/h CO2 was captured, which was compressed and transported to the storage unit in the CTM process, while the CO2 was used as the feed gas in the GH-CTM process. In the methanol synthesis reactor I, 6943.21 kmol/h CO, 890.16 kmol/h CO2, and 17141.84 kmol/h H2 were used to produce methanol. After the crude methanol passed through the distillation unit, methanol with 99.9 wt% purity and 7197 kmol/h (230.12 t/h) production were obtained. Since the key operational parameters of reactor II had been determined, the entire GH-CTM process was simulated to obtain the mass balance. The detailed mass balance of the GH-CTM process was calculated, and the results are presented in Table 8 . As described above, 9153.20 kmol/h CO2 was captured using the Rectisol process, as well as 55.53 kmol/h CO and a small amount of H2. To meet the SN requirements, 28492 kmol/h (56984 kg/h) H2 was required. Meanwhile, the PTH unit produced 14246 kmol/h (455.87 t/h) O2, among which 9840.10 kmol/h was used in the coal gasification unit, and the remainder was for sale. Renewable energy power system provided at least 3018.84 MW power for GH-CTM process, and 485 single electrolytes rated at 6 MW were required. In the methanol synthesis reactor II, 8965.12 kmol/h methanol was produced. After the crude methanol passed through distillation unit II, methanol with 99.9 wt% purity and 8972 kmol/h (286.89 t/h) production were obtained; therefore, the total methanol production was 16169 kmol/h (517.01 t/h). The CTMCCS and GH-CTM processes have the same coal processing capacity and methanol quality. The effective utilization rate of carbon element is only 36.28% for CTMCCS; however, that for the GH-CTM process is 81.52%. In addition, as the byproduct of the PTH process, O2 completely satisfy the coal gasification unit requirement; therefore, we can save the high investment and energy consumption equipment-the air separation unit."
6,Performance analysis,
7,Energy efficiency,"4.1 Energy efficiency Energy efficiency is an important indicator for comparing the CTM and GH-CTM processes. This paper examined the energy efficiencies of the CTM, CTMCCS, and GH-CTM processes. The energy efficiency was calculated using eqs. (18) and (19) [35]: (18) η 1 = E MeOH E Coal + E Util (19) η 2 = E MeOH E Coal + E Util + E CO 2 where η 1 and η 2 represent the system energy efficiencies of the CTM and CTMCCS processes, respectively; E MeOH represents the energy of the methanol product; E Coal represents the energy of coal; E Util represents the energy input of utilities (including steam and electricity); and E CO2 represents the energy input of CO2 transportation and sequestration. The consumption, output product, and energy efficiency of CTM, CTMCCS, and GH-CTM are presented in Table 9 [50,51]. The energy efficiencies of CTM, CTMCCS, and GH-CTM are presented in Fig. 9 . The energy efficiencies of the CTM and CTMCCS processes were 46.96% and 46.34%, respectively; the lower efficiency of the CTMCCS process was due to its higher utilities’ consumption than that of the CTM process. The GH-CTM process consumed a lot of electricity, which was at least 40 times more energy than the conventional CTM process. However, the GH-CTM process made full use of the CO2 by integrating with hydrogen for more than 2 times methanol production than the conventional CTM process. Therefore, the GH-CTM process had the highest energy efficiency (51.90%), which was 10.52% higher than that of the CTM process. The main electricity consumption is in the PTH unit of the GH-CTM process. Reducing the power consumption of PTH is one of the key ways to further improve the energy efficiency of the GH-CTM process; therefore, it is essential to develop a new type of PTH catalyst. For example, Yao et al. had obtained outstanding improvement in water electrolysis yield by the use of catalysts [52,53]."
8,CO2 emission,"4.2 CO2 emission The CO2 emissions of the CTM, CTMCCS, and GH-CTM processes were analyzed in this study. The CO2 emission included direct CO2 emission and indirect CO2 emission. Direct CO2 emission was obtained by mass balances, and indirect CO2 emission was calculated by multiplying energy consumption and emission factors [30]. The CO2 emission and indirect CO2 emission are expressed in eqs. (20) and (21), respectively: (20) E CO 2 = E CO 2 ,direct + E CO 2 ,indirect (21) E CO 2 ,indirect = ∑ E C i × P i,CO 2 Here, E CO2 represents CO2 emission, EC i is the utility (steam and electricity) consumption of the methanol production process, and P i,CO2 is the CO2 emission factor from process utility consumption. The CO2 emission of the GH-CTM process was 85.64% and 67.69% lower than those of the CTM and CTMCCS processes, respectively, while the CO2 emission of the CTMCCS process was 55.57% lower than that of the CTM process. The CO2 emissions of the three processes are depicted in Fig. 10 ."
9,Production cost,"4.3 Production cost The production cost estimation method could be found from Refs. [31,32,54,55]. The production costs of the CTM, CTMCCS, and GH-CTM processes were calculated in this study, and the prices of coal, steam, electricity, oxygen, and methanol were set to 88.6 US$/t, 6 US$/GJ, 0.064 US$/kWh, 142 US$/t, and 328.6 US$/t, respectively. The exchange rate of US dollar and RMB was set as 1 US$ = 7.0 RMB. In addition, 4% of salvage rate and 15 years of depreciation were obtained. The calculated production cost of the GH-CTM process was 201.75 US$/t, 23.95% lower than that of the CTM process, while the calculated production cost of the CTMCCS process was 296 US$/t. The production cost of the liquefied biomass-to-methanol process varied between 300 and 1500 US$/t according to Gonçalves et al. [16]; which was higher than that of the GH-CTM process. In addition, the payback periods of these two processes were calculated. The payback period of the GH-CTM process was 2.8 years, which was lower than that of the CTM process (7.2 years), as shown in Fig. 11 ."
10,Internal rate of return,"4.4 Internal rate of return Internal rate of return (IRR) is an indicator for evaluation of the feasibility of a novel process, which is the discount rate that the present value of the project's future net cash flows equates with the project's initial cash outlay. The calculation of IRR is formulated in Eq. (22) according to the work of Krawczyk et al. (Krawczyk et al., 2016). (22) NPV = ∑ t = 0 n ( CI - CO ) t ( 1 + IRR ) - t = 0 Here, NPV is the net present value, CI is the net cash inflow, CO is the net cash outflow, n is project's period. The IRR of GH-CTM process was 22.4%, as seen in Fig. 12 , which was much higher than that of CTM (15.2%) and CTMCCS (12.8%). Therefore, the novel GH-CTM process has a more promising profitability than conventional CTM and CTMCCS processes."
11,Conclusions,"A novel process of green hydrogen production integrated with CO2 utilization of the conventional coal-to-methanol (CTM) process is proposed in this paper. The use of green hydrogen supplement from renewable energy resources in the conventional CTM process results in low CO2 emission and high methanol productivity. The main conclusions of this study are as follows: (1) The optimized temperature, pressure, gas hourly space velocity, and SN for CO2 direct hydrogenation were 250 °C, 50 bar, 5.9 m3/kgcat·h, and 2.10, respectively. The methanol production of the proposed process reached 517.01 t/h, which was 124.67% higher than that of the conventional CTM process. (2) The proposed process consumed at least 40 times more energy than the conventional CTM process; nevertheless the energy efficiency of the proposed process (51.90%) was higher than that of the CTM process (46.96%), while the CO2 emission was 85.64% lower than that of the CTM process. (3) The production cost of proposed process was 23.95% lower than that of the CTM process; also, the payback period of investment (2.8 years) was lower than that of the CTM process (7.2 years), while IRR was increased by 47.37% compared with traditional CTM process. It is revealed that the supplement of green hydrogen to the conventional CTM process can effectively improve carbon utilization efficiency, increase methanol productivity and economic performance, and reduce environmental impact. This study provides theoretical guidance for the integration of renewable energy power for hydrogen production with the coal-to-chemicals processes and a promising method for CO2 emission reduction of coal-to-chemicals processes."
