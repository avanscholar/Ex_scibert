0,INTRODUCTION,"Aliphatic amines are essential compounds that existed in the structure of strategic materials such as pharmaceutical drugs, alkaloids, agrochemicals, dyes, pigments, polymers, perfumes, corrosion inhibitors, and many others. [1] They are also frequently used as valuable intermediates or precursors for the synthesis of several complex chemical scaffolds, especially biologically active molecules. [2] One of the most beneficial and direct manners for the preparation of aliphatic amines is the reduction (or hydrogenation) of nitriles. Although this method has been frequently used and developed in recent years, it still has disadvantages that need to be improved. In this regard, one of the main drawbacks of this method is the production of a mixture of amines (viz. types 1, 2, and 3), particularly in the presence of metal hydrides and also molecular hydrogen (H2) as reducing or hydrogenating agents, which is indicative of the lack of chemoselectivity. [3] On the other hand, a literature survey shows that a significant number of available methods don't exhibit good chemoselectivity in the presence of other reducible functional groups such as nitro, amide, carboxylic acid, and so on. [4] Therefore, the development of simple and effective chemoselective protocols for the direct reduction (or hydrogenation) of nitriles to primary amines is definitely worthwhile. Due to the strategic and significant role of solvent in the green chemistry principles, [5] the use of an environmentally benign solvent for the specified industrial-interesting reaction is favorable. On this subject, applying water as a solvent makes the reaction process more eco- and environmentally friendly and secure because water is low-price, non-flammable, non-hazardous, non-toxic, and also uniquely redox-stable, which removes all green chemistry concerns for the selection of reaction solvent. [6] In continuation of our ongoing research program on the various organic transformations, [7] and also due to the importance of the direct, environmentally benign, and chemoselective reduction of nitriles, herein we have developed a simple, cost-effective, efficient, and straightforward transfer hydrogenation strategy for the chemoselective reduction of arylnitriles to corresponding primary amines using sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and nickel acetate tetrahydrate (Ni(OAc)2•4H2O) through in situ-generated nickelII dihydride intermediate in the water solvent at 50 ᵒC (Scheme 1 )."
1,RESULTS AND DISCUSSION,"We started our investigation on the reduction of benzonitrile (PhCN) (1 mmol) using 2 mmol of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) in the presence of Ni(OAc)2•4H2O (50 mol%) in water at 50 ᵒC (Table 1 , entry 1). In this mode, and after 12 min, the direct conversion of PhCN to desired benzylamine (PhCH2NH2) was 100%. In the next step, we investigated how temperature influenced the mentioned reduction reaction. As can be seen from entry 2 of Table 1, when the reaction carried out at room temperature (around 25 ᵒC), the reduction reaction had not occurred even after 180 min. Also, increasing the reaction temperature from 50 ᵒC to 100 ᵒC did not have a positive effect on the reaction time (Table 1, entries 3-7). It is worthwhile to note that, reducing the amount of Ni(OAc)2•4H2O from 50 mol% to 20 mol% caused increasing the reaction time from 12 to 30 min, which is clearly shows that the reaction time is strongly influenced by the amount of Ni(OAc)2•4H2O (Table 1, entry 8). At the next step, we screened the effect of various solvents, including PEG-400, MeOH, EtOH, EtOAc, THF, and CH3CN, on the stated reduction reaction. As shown in Table 1 (entries 9-14), no desired product was formed in the presence of the titled solvents. Also, to illustrate the importance of Ni(OAc)2•4H2O on the specified reduction reaction, we tested other types of nickel and or acetate salts (Scheme 2 ). In this regard, we repeated the model reduction reaction in the presence of NiCl2•6H2O (Scheme 2, section b), NiSO4•6H2O (Scheme 2, section c), and Cu(OAc)2•H2O (Scheme 2, section d) instead of Ni(OAc)2•4H2O (Scheme 2, section a) at various temperatures and it found that these salts were unsuitable for this organic transformation. It is worthy to note that Lemaire and co-workers reported a protocol for the reduction of aromatic nitriles into aldehydes using calcium hypophosphite in the presence of Ni(OAc)2•4H2O, in 2018 (Scheme 3 ). [8] The existence of the similar nickel precursor in our and their works and production of different products (viz. primary amine in our work and aromatic aldehyde in their work) led us to examine the impact of the other reducing agents (or hydrogen donors), including formic acid (HCO2H), ammonium formate (HCO2NH4), isopropanol (i-PrOH), and hydrazine monohydrate (NH2NH2•H2O) on the reduction of PhCN in the presence of Ni(OAc)2•4H2O (50 mol%). As shown in Table S1 (see supporting information), the mentioned reducing agents or hydrogen donors were inappropriate for our work. After the above-mentioned studies, and with the optimal conditions identified, the scope of the reduction (or hydrogenation) of arylnitriles to corresponding primary amines was examined. As can be seen from Table 2 , a wide range of aromatic nitriles, regardless of having electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups, can be successfully employed as substrates, which was reduced to furnish the corresponding primary amines in good-to-excellent yields. Notably, for the reduction of dicyanobenzenes (Table 2, entry 10-12), we required higher molar equivalents of NaBH4 (4 mmol), which was added portion-wisely at around 5 min interval into the mixture of reaction. There is no doubt that chemoselectivity is a very crucial factor in organic synthesis, especially in total synthesis. In our presented work (see Table 2), the C=C bonds of the aromatic benzene ring and the halogen moieties (viz. F, Cl, and Br) were unaffected during the nitrile reduction process. This matter prompted us to conduct further investigations on the chemoselectivity of the current strategy. In this regard, we examine some of the most prominent reducible organic compounds, including nitrobenzene (PhNO2), benzoic acid (PhCO2H), methyl benzoate (PhCO2CH3), acetanilide (PhNHCOCH3), benzaldehyde (PhCHO), and acetophenone (PhCOCH3) instead of PhCN under our optimized reaction conditions (Scheme 4 ). The results demonstrated that NO2, CO2H, CO2CH3, NHCOCH3 as the reduction-sensitive groups were completely unaffected during the reaction process (Scheme 4, sections b-e). But, the CHO group reduced to corresponding alcohol in 5 min under mentioned reaction conditions (Scheme 4, section f). It should be noted that benzaldehyde in the presence of NaBH4 is very reduction-sensitive. So, it could be reduced to benzyl alcohol using NaBH4 (1 mmol) at room temperature in 30 min in the absence of any catalyst, additive, and or promotor. Although the sensitivity of the COCH3 in the reduction process is lower than CHO, under presented reaction conditions. As shown in Scheme 4 (section g), some of the acetophenone (approximately 45%) converted to the corresponding 1-phenylethan-1-ol after 360 min. The chemoselectivity experiments clearly showed that our presented strategy can be used in total synthesis because chemoselective reduction behaviors of our protocol in the presence of various reducible functional groups are very impressive, and it only requires simple protection-deprotection steps in the presence of CHO and COCH3 (for example, protection of mentioned carbonyl groups by ethylene glycol and convenient deprotection after reduction of the desired nitrile moiety). Finally, we presented a plausible reaction mechanism for the reduction of aromatic nitriles to the corresponding primary amines using NaBH4 and Ni(OAc)2•4H2O based on reliable literature data, [9] and our observation (especially observation of created hydrogen gas bubbles into the reaction environment) (Scheme 5 ). Furthermore, some experiments were designed to figure out the performing reduction (or hydrogenation) process along with identification of the most impressive in situ-generated intermediate in this reaction. Based on existing research papers, nickel boride (Ni2B) is the most likely product of the reaction between NaBH4 and Ni(OAc)2•4H2O. Interestingly and in stark contrast, all of our efforts for the carried out reduction of PhCN in the presence of alone Ni2B were unsuccessful in water under various reaction temperatures (Table S2, see supporting information). Therefore, based on all the existed evidence, we assume that in the first step, NiII converted to Ni0 in the presence of in situ-produced hydrogen gas, which caused the formation of nickel0 dihydrogen intermediate. Then, homolytic HH bond-splitting that often known as H2 activation occurred via oxidative addition manner, which caused the formation of nickelII dihydride intermediate. Then, the in situ-generated nickelII dihydride intermediate reduced the unsaturated bonds of CN."

Afterward, Ni(OAc)2•4H2O (50 mol%) was added, and the mixture was stirred. Then, NaBH4 (2 mmol) was added, and the resulting mixture was continued to stirring at 50 ᵒC for 12 min. Upon completion of the reaction (monitored by TLC), the mixture was cooled to room temperature, and then 5 mL of water was added to the reaction mixture and was stirred at room temperature for about 5-10 min. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) (2 × 4 mL). The organic layers were combined and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). Next, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure, and subsequently, the pure colorless liquid benzylamine was obtained in 89% yield."
