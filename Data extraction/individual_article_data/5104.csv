0,Introduction,"Unsaturated alcohols are very important intermediates for pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and fragrance productions [1–3]. Selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes using heterogeneous catalysts is of great interest because it can facilitate the reaction process and lower the cost. More importantly, the heterogeneous method can avoid the waste that is produced in the present process using NaBH4 or AlLiH4 [4]. However, the challenge for heterogeneous processes lies in the fact that the reduction of the CC bond is usually preferred over the reduction of the CO bond on monometallic catalysts due to both thermodynamic and kinetic factors [5,6]. Intensive studies have been performed on the Pt based catalysts, the most commonly used catalysts for selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. Usually, the selectivity to the desired unsaturated alcohol is low on the monometallic Pt catalysts supported on non-reducible support, due to the preferential reduction of CC bond. In order to obtain high selectivity, people have tried to modify the Pt catalysts. For example, it was reported that the addition of electropositive metals such as Fe, Sn and Ni could enhance the selectivity [7–9]. Also, Cl species in the catalysts, which originated from the H2PtCl6 were considered important for the reaction [10]. These findings indicated that such electronic modification could enhance the catalytic performance, probably by changing the electronic structure of the active Pt metal. Riguetto et al. [11] demonstrated that the electronic properties of the active metal exerted important impacts on the selectivity and concluded that the surface electron density of the active metal particles was crucial to improving the adsorption and reactivity of the CO bond. On the other hand, the structure of the Pt metal is also essential to the reaction, especially the selectivity. Abid et al. [12] reported high selectivity to unsaturated alcohol on Pt/CeO2 catalysts. They concluded that the selectivity of Pt/CeO2 catalyst is mainly determined by the metal particle size. The large particles of Pt containing high fractions of Pt(111) surfaces favored the adsorption of crotonaldehyde via the CO bond, leading to a higher selectivity of unsaturated alcohol. Similar conclusions were also drawn by Plomp et al. for the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde [13]. Surface properties of the support are also reported to be crucial to the reactivities of the Pt catalysts. Englisch et al. [14] found that Lewis acid sites enhanced the adsorption strength of the CO bond, thus resulting in the enhanced selectivity to crotyl alcohol. So the appropriate strength of Lewis acid sites is critical for the reaction. In this work, the role of NaCl as a promoter for the Pt/ZrO2 catalysts for gas phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde is investigated and reported. The addition of NaCl in the catalysts not only affects the electronegativity and particle size of Pt metal, but also the surface acidity of the support, which greatly influences the catalytic behavior of the catalysts for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation All reagents were analytically pure and were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. ZrO2 was prepared from hydrochloride precursors by a precipitation method. An NH3 aqueous solution was added to a ZrOCl2 solution under constant stirring. The pH of the resulting mixture was controlled at 10±0.5. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24h, and the precipitate was then filtered after aging at 90°C for 5 days and washed with distilled water several times. The achieved white powder was dried at 70°C for 4h under vacuum, followed by calcination at 400°C for 4h, leading to the final support with a specific surface area of 263m2/g. The NaCl/ZrO2 supports were prepared by impregnating ZrO2 with a NaCl aqueous solution (0.1mol/L). The NaCl-modified support was dried at 120°C overnight and calcined at 400°C for 4h. The modified supports were denoted as NaCl(x)/ZrO2, where x (0, 0.5, 1, 3 and 6) refers to the molar ratio of NaCl/ZrO2 (%). The supported Pt catalysts were prepared by impregnating the supports with aqueous solution of H2PtCl6, with a nominal Pt content of 3wt.%. Excess solution was removed by mild evaporation. Finally, the catalysts were dried overnight at 120°C. The catalysts were denoted as Pt/NaCl(x)/ZrO2. For comparison, a chlorine free catalyst (denoted as Pt(N)/ZrO2) was also prepared. The ZrO2 was prepared using ZrO(NO3)2 as the precursor, and the synthesis process was the same as that for the chlorine-containing ZrO2. Then an aqueous solution of Pt(NO3)2 was impregnated to the support. The nominal Pt content was 3wt.%."
3,Catalyst characterizations,"2.2 Catalyst characterizations All the catalysts were reduced in H2 at 500°C for 1h prior to characterizations as well as prior to the reactions. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded with a PANalytic X’Pert PW3040 diffractiometer using Cu Kα radiation. The working voltage was 40kV and the working current was 40mA. The patterns were collected in a 2θ range from 20° to 110°, with scanning steps of 0.15°s−1. Elemental compositions of the reduced catalysts were determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis, with an ARL ADVANT’X Intelli Power 4200 scanning X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. The results were analyzed using UniQuant non-standard sample quantitative analysis software. The sodium content was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) technique. The results are listed in Table 1 . CO-chemisorption experiments were carried out on a Quantachrame CHEMBET-3000 instrument. The sample was placed in a quartz U-tube, and purified He was used as the carrier gas. The sample was reduced in a H2–N2 mixture (5vol% H2) stream at 500°C for 1h and cooled down to 30°C in a pure He flow. Then pulses of CO were fed into the stream of carrier gas with a precision analytical syringe. Pt dispersion was evaluated from the consumption of CO, assuming that CO:Pt=1:1. The acidic properties of the catalysts were studied by ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) and Fourier transmission infrared spectra (FTIR) analysis of pyridine adsorption. For the NH3-TPD experiment, the catalyst was pretreated in a flow of N2 (30ml/min) at 500°C for 1h, and then cooled to room temperature. Afterwards, a flow of NH3 (30ml/min) was introduced into the reactor for 15min, followed by purging with a N2 flow (30ml/min at 100°C) to remove the physisorbed NH3. The NH3-TPD profile was measured using a TECHTEMP GC 7890 II with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) when the sample was heated at a rate of 10°C/min from 200 to 560°C. Meanwhile, the above process at the same conditions was repeated and the total amount of NH3 desorbed was determined by reaction with an excess of dilute hydrochloric acid and back titration with sodium hydroxide solution. The sensitive indicator contains a mixture of 0.1% brom–cresol green ethanol solution and 0.2% methyl red ethanol solution with a volume ratio of 3:1. For the FTIR experiment, the spectra were recorded at room temperature on a NEXUS 670 Fourier transform infrared spectroscope equipped with a diffuse reflectance accessory. The self-supported sample wafer was dried in an oven for 1h at 100°C prior to pyridine treatment for IR measurements. The catalyst was exposed first to pyridine directly, and then kept in a vacuum oven at 120°C for 1h to remove physisorbed pyridine. After the sample was cooled down to room temperature, each IR spectrum was recorded in a spectral range of 1200–2250cm−1 with 64 scans and at a resolution of 4cm−1. In order to study the oxidation state of Pt, we performed in situ diffuse reflectance infrared transform spectra (DRIFTS) measurement of CO-chemisorption. Prior to the measurement, the sample was in situ reduced in a H2–N2 mixture (30ml/min, 5vol% H2) at 500°C for 1h. After the pretreatment, the sample was cooled down to 25°C and a flow of He (30ml/min) was fed to remove the residual H2. Then the sample was exposed to CO for 30min. Finally, the sample was purged by He for another 30min and the spectra were recorded. In all cases the spectra were taken at 25°C, with a resolution of 4cm−1 and a cumulative averaging of 64 scans. The crotonaldehyde chemisorption on catalyst surface was performed by DRIFTS measurement. The pretreatment condition was the same as that in the in situ DRIFTS of CO adsorption. When the sample had cooled down to 50°C, a flow of crotonaldehyde was introduced by pure He for 15min. The crotonaldehyde was introduced in a trap set maintained at 0°C to achieve a constant crotonaldehyde partial pressure (1062Pa). Finally, the sample was purged by He for 120min and a spectrum was recorded. In all cases, the spectra were taken at 50°C with a resolution of 4cm−1 and with a cumulative averaging of 64 scans. For the Pt/ZrO2 and Pt/NaCl(3)/ZrO2 catalysts, after the ultra-pure H2 reduction at 500°C treatment, the oxidation states of Pt were measured on a VG ESCALAB MK-2 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) with Al Kα monochromatic X-rays. The voltage and power for the measurements were 12.5kV and 250W, respectively. The vacuum in the test chamber during the collection of spectra was maintained at 2×10−10 mbar. The binding energies were calibrated for the surface charge by referencing to the C1S peak of the contaminant carbon at 284.6eV."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test The gas phase crotonaldehyde hydrogenation was carried out in a fixed bed reaction system at atmospheric pressure, using a quartz tube (10mm i.d.) reactor. One hundred mg of catalyst was loaded in the reactor with a thermocouple placed in the middle of the catalyst bed to monitor the reaction temperature. Before the catalytic test was run, the catalyst was reduced at 500°C for 1h in ultra-pure H2 (26ml/min) and then it was cooled down to 50°C. The crotonaldehyde was introduced in a trap set before the reactor tube and was maintained at 0°C to achieve a constant crotonaldehyde partial pressure (1062Pa). The gas line was kept at about 60°C to avoid any condensation. The reaction products and reactant were analyzed on line using a gas chromatography (Shimazu GC-2014) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a DB-Wax column (0.32mm×30m) capillary column."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Phase and composition of Pt/NaCl/ZrO2 catalysts,"3.1 Phase and composition of Pt/NaCl/ZrO2 catalysts Table 1 lists the contents of Pt, Cl and Na elements analyzed by XRF and ICP-AES in the reduced catalysts. Note that the Na content was measured by ICP-AES in order to avoid any disturbance of ZrO2 due to using the XRF technique. It is found that the Pt content in all catalysts is about 2.8%, which is close to the nominal Pt loading (3%). Also, Cl is present in the catalysts even after H2 reduction, which is due to the fact that ZrO2 support was prepared from ZrOCl2 and H2PtCl6 precursors. It is also found that the contents of Na and Cl increase with the increasing of NaCl contents. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the Pt/NaCl/ZrO2 catalysts. It can be seen that the diffraction peaks of the ZrO2 support are very weak, indicating that the support is amorphous. No diffraction peaks due to Pt or PtO x are observed when the NaCl content is lower than 3%, indicating the presence of very small Pt particles in the catalysts. However, for the Pt/NaCl(6)/ZrO2 catalyst, weak diffraction peaks assigned to metal Pt are observed at 2θ =39.9° (111), 46.7° (200), 68.1° (220) and 81.8° (311). This suggests that the Pt particles grow larger with the increasing of NaCl contents. Table 2 lists the Pt dispersion and particle size in Pt/NaCl/ZrO2 catalysts, based on the CO-chemisorption analysis. The dispersion of Pt particles decreases with increasing NaCl content, and therefore the average particle size of Pt grows from 2.3 to 6.0nm. This is in agreement with the XRD results, further suggesting the growth of Pt particles with the addition of NaCl."
7,Surface acidity of the Pt/NaCl/ZrO2 catalysts,"3.2 Surface acidity of the Pt/NaCl/ZrO2 catalysts Fig. 2 shows the NH3-TPD profiles and the amount of acid of the Pt/NaCl/ZrO2 catalysts. The NH3-TPD results (Fig. 2) indicate that the amount of acid sites decreased with NaCl content, which suggests that the acidic sites decrease with NaCl content. Considering that NaCl is not a basic compound, it is more likely that NaCl blocked the acidic sites of the ZrO2, instead of neutralizing the acidic sites. Meanwhile, we found that the initial temperature of NH3 desorption decreases, from 196°C for the Pt/ZrO2 catalyst down to 179°C for the Pt/NaCl(6)/ZrO2. At the same time, the NH3 desorption peak temperatures shift from 304 and 337°C for the Pt/ZrO2 catalyst to 292 and 322°C for the Pt/NaCl(6)/ZrO2, respectively. The results here indicate that the addition of NaCl has weakened the acid strength of the catalysts. In order to determine the nature of acidic sites, we conducted pyridine adsorption experiments. Fig. 3 shows the FTIR spectra of pyridine adsorption of the Pt/NaCl/ZrO2 catalysts. The band at 1445cm−1 is characteristic of Lewis acid sites, and the broad band near 1629cm−1 is assigned either to Lewis acid centers or to the vibrations of some remaining water molecules [15]. The band at 1542cm−1 attributed to Brønsted acid sites [16] is very weak. The ratio of Lewis acid sites to Brønsted acid sites (L/B) can be calculated by comparing the peak area of the band at 1445cm−1 and that of the band at 1542cm−1. The ratio is about 5/1, indicating that the surfaces of the catalyst are mainly occupied by Lewis acid sites."
8,In situ DRIFTS of CO adsorption on Pt/NaCl/ZrO2 catalysts,"3.3 In situ DRIFTS of CO adsorption on Pt/NaCl/ZrO2 catalysts Fig. 4 shows the in situ DRIFTS spectra of CO adsorption on Pt/NaCl/ZrO2 catalysts. It can be seen that the areas of IR peaks decrease with increasing of NaCl content, that is because the particle size of Pt increases, which leads to the reduction of the number of Pt particles [17]. For the Pt/ZrO2 catalyst without NaCl, the spectrum showed a band centered at 2065cm−1, which is assigned to CO linearly adsorbed on Pt particles [18]. However, no bridge CO species (∼1855cm−1) [19] are observed for any of the catalysts, suggesting that the CO adsorption on the catalysts is in linear mode. The adsorptions of linear CO bands shift to lower wavenumbers with the increasing of NaCl contents. The variation of wavenumbers for CO adsorption band has been extensively studied [19,20]. For instance, Rades et al. [19] concluded that the reason for the shift to a lower frequency in Pt/NaY catalysts was due to negative charging of supported metal particles, which resulted from the transfer of electrons from the basic oxygen anions of the carrier to the metal. Panagiotopoulou and Kondarides [20] studied Pt/TiO2 catalysts modified with Na and Cs; they found that Pt particles on Pt/TiO2 modified with alkali metals had higher electron density values than these on Pt/TiO2. From the above-mentioned findings, it can be concluded that the addition of NaCl in the Pt/ZrO2 catalysts leads to an electronic modification of the metal phase. The addition of NaCl brings an increase in the electron density of Pt and is considered to be the reason for the shift [20]."
9,XPS analysis of Pt/NaCl(x)/ZrO2 catalysts,"3.4 XPS analysis of Pt/NaCl(x)/ZrO2 catalysts Fig. 5 shows the XPS spectra of Pt 4f for the Pt/ZrO2 and Pt/NaCl(3)/ZrO2 catalysts after in situ reduction treatment. For all the catalysts, the spectra show two broad bands, corresponding to the Pt 4f7/2 (at low binding energies) and Pt 4f5/2 levels (at high binding energies). For the Pt/ZrO2 catalyst, the binding energies of Pt 4f5/2 and Pt 4f7/2 are 74.7 and 71.4eV, respectively; while for the Pt/NaCl(3)/ZrO2 catalyst, these values are 74.4 and 71.1eV. These results clearly show that the Pt species in the reduced catalysts are metallic Pt [21]. However, compared with the Pt/ZrO2 catalyst, a shift of about 0.3eV toward lower binding energies for the Pt/NaCl(3)/ZrO2 catalyst is observed, which can be attributed to an increase in the electron density of Pt due to the addition of NaCl [22]. This is in agreement with the in situ DRIFTS spectra of CO adsorption (Fig. 4), further demonstrating that the addition of NaCl enhances the electronegativity of Pt."
10,Reactivities of Pt/NaCl/ZrO2 catalysts,"3.5 Reactivities of Pt/NaCl/ZrO2 catalysts Fig. 6 shows crotonaldehyde conversion and selectivities to hydrogenation products as a function of reaction time on the Pt/NaCl(1)/ZrO2 catalyst for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. The products are crotyl alcohol (formed by hydrogenation of the carbonyl CO bond), butanal (formed by hydrogenation of the CC bond), butanol (formed by hydrogenation of the CO and CC bands) and hydrocarbons (formed by polymerization). Fig. 6 clearly shows that the catalyst gives a conversion of 20% during the first 30min of reaction, but it is deactivated and reaches a quasi-steady state after 1.5h. Such deactivation is commonly observed for this reaction, and it has been explained as due to polymerization and decarbonylation reactions that lead to a loss of active sites [23]. In the quasi-steady state regime of the catalyst, a conversion of 7% is obtained after 5h of reaction. The selectivity to crotyl alcohol increases quickly during the first 30min and reaches a stable level (about 60%) afterwards. In order to explain the loss of the activity of the catalyst with the reaction time, we performed an FTIR examination of used catalyst. Fig. 7 shows the FTIR spectra of the Pt/NaCl(1)/ZrO2 catalyst. Compared with the fresh catalyst, it is found that the adsorption bands are very different for the used one. Used catalyst exhibits bands at 1171, 1082, 799, 788, 674cm−1. The adsorption bands at 1171 and 1082cm−1 are assigned to ν C–O [24,25], while the bands at 799, 788, 674cm−1 are assigned to δ C–H. This result suggests that during the reaction, organic compounds are formed on the catalyst surface by polymerization of reaction products; such formation may lead to a partial loss of active sites and thus suppress the reactivity. Table 3 shows the reactivities of the Pt/NaCl/ZrO2 catalysts for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. For comparison, we give the reactivities of the catalysts to which other additives such as KOH, KCl, NaOH and Na2CO3 are added. It can be seen that the catalytic activities of Pt/NaOH(3)/ZrO2 and Pt/Na2CO3(3)/ZrO2 are similar to that of Pt/NaCl(3)/ZrO2 catalyst. Considering that many works pointed out that the presence of Cl has great influence on the reaction [10], NaCl was selected as an additive to be investigated in detail. From Table 3, one can see that the conversion of the catalyst increases with increasing NaCl content, from 6% to 14%. However, the selectivity to crotyl alcohol reaches a maximum at the NaCl content of 1% (60%) and decreases with the further increasing of NaCl contents. In contrast, the selectivity to butanal first decreases but then increases when the NaCl content is higher than 1%. In addition, the TOFs of the catalysts based on particle size of Pt show a more pronounced enhancement with the increasing of NaCl contents, from 1.6 to 11.1×10−3 s−1. Adding excess NaCl is disadvantageous to CO hydrogenation. The reason is that the reaction rate of CO hydrogenation continued to increase with NaCl content; however, the CC hydrogenation rate increased more intensively, so the selectivity to crotyl alcohol decreased."
11,Active sites of Pt/NaCl(1)/ZrO2 catalysts,"3.6 Active sites of Pt/NaCl(1)/ZrO2 catalysts The activity of the supported Pt catalysts for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde is affected by various factors, such as the surface acidity and electronic property of the Pt metal, as described in Section 1. In this work, the NH3-TPD (Fig. 2) and the pyridine adsorption (Fig. 3) results indicate that the support surface contains mainly Lewis acid sites, and that the strength of the Lewis acid sites weakens with the increasing of NaCl contents. The CO-chemisorption (Fig. 4) and XPS (Fig. 5) results suggest that the electron density of Pt increases with the increasing of NaCl contents. According to the adsorption model proposed by Englisch et al. [14] and based on the co-existence of the surface Lewis acid sites and the Pt active sites in this system, a proposed model for crotonaldehyde adsorption on Pt/NaCl/ZrO2 catalyst is shown in Scheme 1 . The carbonyl oxygen is suggested to strongly interact with Lewis acid sites (electron pair donor sites) and the Pt particle is the adsorption center of CC band and carbonyl carbon. In order to further explain the influence of Pt active sites and the Lewis acid sites on selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, we studied in situ DRIFTS of crotonaldehyde adsorption, as shown in Fig. 8 . The bands due to free crotonaldehyde molecules (ν CO at 1694cm−1, ν CC at 1639cm−1, δ asCH3 at 1445cm−1, δ CH3 at 1395cm−1, δ CH at 1376cm−1) can be clearly identified [26,27]. However, when the crotonaldehyde molecules adsorb on the NaCl(1)/ZrO2 support and on the Pt/NaCl(1)/ZrO2 catalyst, the bands undergo remarkable shifts. The band at 1677cm−1 is close to the main band of crotonaldehyde molecules, and its intensity becomes weaker with purging He. Therefore, the band at 1677cm−1 is attributed to ν CO of physisorbed crotonaldehyde. The band at 1586cm−1 for the support and the band at 1576cm−1 for the catalyst are attributed to ν CO of chemisorbed of crotonaldehyde. The relevant down shift of the crotonaldehyde ν CO (from 1694 to 1586cm−1) indicates that crotonaldehyde molecules partially adsorb on Lewis acid sites through carbonyl oxygen, which is consistent with the previous study [27]. Moreover, due to the stronger surface acidity of the NaCl(1)/ZrO2 support compared to that of the TiO2 in Ref. [27], the shift is more pronounced. For the Pt/NaCl(1)/ZrO2 catalyst, the band of ν CO is observed at 1576cm−1, which is 10cm−1 lower than that on the support. This indicates that the interaction of carbonyl group with the catalyst is even stronger than that with the support. Moreover, this result further validates the proposed adsorption model, that is, carbonyl carbon adsorbs on the Pt sites and carbonyl oxygen adsorbs on the Lewis acid sites. According to the adsorption model of Scheme 1, it can be seen that the catalytic activity is mainly affected by both the Pt active sites and the Lewis acid sites. The increase of the electron density on Pt is beneficial to the adsorption of carbonyl carbon, which leads to the hydrogenation of CO bond. Furthermore, it was reported that high acidity can result in high catalytic activity at the initial stage of reaction, but it also can lead to high coking and easy deactivation for the reaction [28]. In this work, the strength of Lewis acidity weakens with the increasing of NaCl in the catalyst, which could well explain the enhanced reactivity on the NaCl-modified Pt/ZrO2 catalysts in the quasi-steady state. In order to further explain the influence of the Lewis acidity on the reactivity, we prepared the chlorine free Pt(N)/ZrO2 catalyst. The particle size of Pt in the Pt(N)/ZrO2 catalyst measured by CO-chemisorption is 2.0nm, which is very close to that of the chlorine-containing Pt/ZrO2 catalyst (Table 2). The NH3-TPD profiles of the Pt/ZrO2 and Pt(N)/ZrO2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 9 . It is obvious that the amount of NH3 desorbed on the Pt/ZrO2 catalyst is much larger than that on the Pt(N)ZrO2, with a relative peak area ratio of 5. This indicates that the Lewis acidity of the ZrO2 support prepared by ZrOCl2 precursor can be reinforced by chlorine [29]. The desorption temperature of NH3 for the Pt/ZrO2 catalyst also is higher than that for the Pt(N)/ZrO2, indicating that the acid strength of Pt/ZrO2 is stronger than that of the Pt(N)/ZrO2. This result tells us that the Lewis acid sites are mainly generated by chlorine species in the catalyst. Fig. 9 also presents the conversion of crotonaldehyde on the two catalysts (obtained at 5h reaction). We found that the conversion of crotonaldehyde on the Pt/ZrO2 (6%) is lower than that on the Pt(N)/ZrO2 (11%). This result is consistent with the hypothesis mentioned above, that is, a Lewis acid with too great strength is disadvantageous to the catalytic activity [28]. Therefore, for the Pt/NaCl/ZrO2 catalysts, the addition of NaCl leads to the weakened strength of Lewis acid (Fig. 2), which could be one reason of the improvement of the reactivity. Considering the selectivity to the desired product crotyl alcohol, we found that when NaCl content is 1%, the selectivity to crotyl alcohol is the highest, while that for butanal is the lowest. The factors that influence the selectivity have been extensively discussed in the literature. Ammari et al. [10] concluded that the Pt catalysts prepared from platinum chloride precursor with strong Lewis acidity have high selectivities toward α,β-unsaturated alcohol. Englisch et al. [14] reported that the terminal oxygen of crotonaldehyde strongly interacted with the Lewis acid sites and this interaction led to high selectivity to crotyl alcohol. Therefore, Lewis acid sites are considered to be one of the key factors leading to high crotyl alcohol selectivity. In this study, the strength of Lewis acid becomes weaker with the increasing of NaCl contents (Fig. 2), which could have led to a decrease for the selectivity to crotyl alcohol. But in fact, the selectivity to crotyl alcohol increases and reaches the maximum when the NaCl content is 1% in the catalyst (Table 3). In order to explain the enhancement of selectivity on the NaCl-modified catalysts, the electronic state of Pt must be taken into account [30]. When the NaCl content is below 1%, the Pt particle size does not change much (about 3nm, Table 1), so the Pt particle size is not considered to be the major factor that affects the selectivity to crotyl alcohol. The DRIFTS results of CO adsorption (Fig. 4) and XPS results (Fig. 5) clearly show that with the increasing of NaCl contents, the electron density of Pt increases; such higher density can easily attract the electron positive carbonyl carbon. The strong interaction of the electronegative Pt particles with electropositive carbonyl carbon could certainly improve the selectivity to the crotyl alcohol; such improvement probably plays a key role as it compensates the opposite effect of the weak acidic strength of the NaCl-containing catalysts on the decline of selectivity. When the NaCl content is higher than 1% in the catalyst, the particle size of Pt changes significantly and grows from 3.7 to 6.0nm. Thus, the influence of Pt particle size on the selectivity must be taken into account. Previous studies pointed out that large Pt particles are favorable for the formation of crotyl alcohol [31], however, the selectivity declines with the increase of Pt particles (Table 3) in the present work. According to the crotonaldehyde adsorption model (Scheme 1), the formation of crotyl alcohol takes place on the interface region, which involves both Pt and Lewis acid sites. The growth of Pt particle results in a decline in the amount of interfacial sites of Pt contacting with Lewis acid sites, while the sites for the CC bond adsorption increase. Therefore, the competing adsorption of CC bond on large Pt particles suppresses the selectivity to crotyl alcohol. Moreover, the weakened Lewis acidity on the high NaCl content catalyst may suppress the adsorption of CO bond, which would result in the lowered selectivity to crotyl alcohol. This is consistent with the reaction results (Table 3), as the selectivity to butanal increases when the NaCl content is higher than 1%, accompanied by the loss of selectivity to crotyl alcohol. In summary, the selectivity to the desired product crotyl alcohol is influenced by several factors: the strength of Lewis acid sites, the electronegativity of Pt species and the Pt particle size. The weak strength of Lewis acid sites will suppress the selectivity, while highly electronegative Pt species are beneficial to the enhancement of the selectivity. Moreover, when the Pt particles grow larger, the interfacial sites for CO adsorption decline while the adsorption of CC bond becomes more pronounced, thus suppressing the selectivity to crotyl alcohol."
12,Conclusions,"In this work, we demonstrated that the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde can be enhanced by the modification of the Pt/ZrO2 catalyst. By adding NaCl to Pt/ZrO2 catalysts, one can remarkably enhance the reactivity of the catalyst and the selectivity to crotyl alcohol. The characterization results show that the addition of NaCl decreases the strength of the Lewis acid sites; such lower strength is believed to be the main factor for the enhanced activity. With a low NaCl content (≤1%), the increase in the electron density on Pt leads to the increase of the selectivity to crotyl alcohol; however with a high NaCl content (>1%), the growth of Pt particle size and the weakened strength of Lewis acid lead to the decrease of the selectivity."
