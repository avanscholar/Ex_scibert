0,Introduction,"Hydrogen as a green energy source plays an important role in protecting the environment and solving the problems such as energy depletion and global climate change [1]. Therefore, it is essential to develop an efficient hydrogen production technology and hydrogen purification technology. However, hydrogen production includes the electrolysis process of water, the steam reforming process of hydrocarbons, and the decomposition process of methanol, the separation of H2 from CO2, CO and hydrocarbons (such as methane and propane etc.) has become an important industrial process [2]. The purification technologies of hydrogen involve cryogenic distillation, pressure swing adsorption and membrane separation [3–5]. Compared with conventional separation methods, newly-developed membrane separation technology has great potential in industry application because it is simple to be processed with low manufacturing cost [6]. Several types of membranes such as zeolite membrane [7,8], metal organic frameworks (MOFs) membrane [9–12] and mixed matrix membrane etc. [13–15] had been developed for the hydrogen purification. MOFs are always constructed from metal ions coordination with divergent carboxylate ligands or imidazole ligands, including MOF-5 [16,17], HKUST-1 [18,19], ZIF-8 [20,21], etc. Due to rich and easily tailed pore structure and adsorption affinities of MOFs, MOFs have attracted intense interest for gas adsorption and storage, molecular separation and catalysis by a large number of researchers in the past decades [22–25]. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) [26,27] are a subclass of MOFs materials with well-ordered pore structure and excellent hydrothermal stability, therefore ZIF membranes is one of the most promising gas separation membrane. As was well known, the barrier for preparing a continuous membrane lies in the competition between homogeneous nucleation in synthesis precursor and heterogeneous nucleation on the support surface. Heterogeneous nucleation can increase the amount of nucleation sites on the support surface, resulting in the formation of more small crystals. With the progress of the crystal growth, the small crystals are integrated into the large crystals which makes grain boundary defects decrease, due to Oswald ripening mechanism [28,29]. Therefore, promoting the heterogeneous nucleation on the substrate surface is an effective principle to obtain a low-defect membrane layer. Seed coating and/or chemical modification of the substrates were usually used to promote for fabricating MOF membranes. Pan et al. [30] successfully prepared ZIF-8 membrane by the secondary growth method. The prepared membrane showed a well performance for the separation of gas mixtures, but the reproducibility of membrane is still a challenge. Zhang et al. [31] fabricated ZIF-8 membrane on the porous tubular ceramic substrates by modifying the substrates with ZnO to promote heterogeneous nucleation of ZIF-8 crystals. By introducing a ZnAl-CO3 LDH layer on the porous ceramic substrate, Liu et al. [32] prepared ZIF-8 membrane on the porous ceramic substrate. Huang et al. [33] also reported ZIF-22 membrane with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane as covalent linker to promote heterogeneous nucleation of ZIF-22 crystals. Inspired by the bio-adhesive ability of the marine mussel, the polydopamine (PDA) was anchored on the support. Thus, PDA can act as covalent linker for anchoring ZIF-8 nutrients and substrate surface [34]. In addition, the PDA layer is very benefit for the heterogeneous nucleation of ZIF-8 crystals. Hence, it has attracted more researchers’ attentions for introducing an effective strategy to get a low defect membrane in the past. In previous works, the obtained ZIF-8 membranes usually showed relatively low permeance, mainly due to the thick membrane layer that can improve the mass transfer resistance for the gas. Caro et al. [35] and Jeong et al. [36] reported ZIF-8 membranes with the thickness of 30 μm and 20 μm, respectively. The membranes showed a permeation of 6.04 × 10−8 and about 1.57 × 10−7mol·m−2·s−1·Pa−1 for each. Although the PDA was used as covalent linker for ZIF-8 membrane synthesis, the obtained membrane had a thick membrane layer of about 20 μm with H2 permeances about 1.8 × 10−7 mol·m−2·s−1·Pa−1 [34]. In addition, Shao et al. [37] fabricated ZIF-8 membrane on anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) supports which have highly ordered tunnel arrays, and the dopamine as a modulator was in-situ added into the MOF precursor solution. ZIF-8/PDA (synthesis for 1 h) showed a much higher H2 permeance (146 × 10−8 mol m−2 s−1 Pa−1) with quite low gas selectivities, because of the thin ZIF-8/PDA layer and crystal defects. With the longer synthesis time, the as-synthesized membrane also showed a lower gas permeance. Besides, ZIF-8 crystals entering into the substrate pores may also lead to an increase of the mass transfer resistance [38]. To get a higher permeance for separation, Lee et al. [39] prepared a highly permeable ZIF-8 membrane on a α-Al2O3 substrate by post synthetic linker exchange which is based on linker exchange of 2-methylimidazole (ZIF-8 linker) with 2-imidazolecarboxaldehyde (ZIF-90 linker). The linker exchange process can reduce the effective thickness of the ZIF-8 membrane and enlarge the pore diameter of the crystals on the surface of the membrane, leading to the membrane showed a drastic increase in propylene permeance, with a negligible loss in propylene/propane separation factor. Huang et al. [40] reported that the high-permeance ZIF-8 membrane on stainless-steel net (SSN) by dopamine modified the stainless-steel net, with a well H2/CH4 selectivity of 23.2, and the H2 permeance was 2.66 × 10−5 mol·m−2·s−1·Pa−1 attributing to stainless-steel net (SSN) with large porosity, which greatly reduces the mass transfer resistance of gas molecules. To our knowledge, it is still a challenge to prepare a ZIF-8 membrane with high permeance while maintaining high separation selectivity at present. In this work, we reported an effective method for preparing a high H2 permeance ZIF-8 membrane on α-Al2O3 substrate through a combination of dopamine modification and seed coating (Fig. 1 ). For one thing, the function of PDA on substrate can afford more heterogeneous nucleation sites and provide a barrier and/or adhesivity to prevent seed crystals from entering the substrate pores. For another thing, seed coating can play a similar role for heterogeneous nucleation, at the same time, seed layers can reduce the time for the membrane formation and lead to prepare a thin membrane layer. Therefore, the low mass transfer resistance which is responsible for high permeance will be greatly reduced. The higher permeable ZIF-8 membrane can be used for hydrogen purification."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (>99.99%, Aladdin), 2-methylimidazole (>99%, Sigma-Aldrich), dopamine (DPA, 99%, Aladdin), tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (Tris-HCl, 99%, Aladdin), methanol (99%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.), hydrochloric acid (36%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.), deionized water (DI water, Homemade). All chemical reagents are not further purified. The porous alumina substrate (diameter = 22 mm, and thickness = 2 mm) was homemade by pressing and sintering with alumina powder (>99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich). In order to reduce the roughness of the surface of the substrates, the side of alumina substrates were polished with two types of sandpapers (#1200, #5000), respectively, followed by washing in ultrasonic bath with deionized water for 15 min, and dried for 12 h at 100 °C."
3,Pretreatment of the substrate,"2.2 Pretreatment of the substrate 2.2.1 Modification by PDA The α-Al2O3 substrate was modified by dopamine according to the previous work through minor modifications [34,41,42]. The dopamine (2 mg/mL) was dissolved in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 8.5) in an open watch glass. And then, α-Al2O3 substrate was treated with dopamine at 25 °C for 24 h. Finally, the derived substrates (PDA-substrate) were saved in an oven for 12 h at 60 °C. 2.2.2 Coating seeds The process of coating seeds is listed as follows: First, ZIF-8 crystals were synthesized, zinc nitrate hexahydrate (0.734 g) and 2-methylimidazole (0.811 g) were dissolved in methanol (100 mL), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The obtained white powder (ZIF-8 crystals) was collected by centrifuging, washed with methanol three times, and dried in an oven for 12 h at 60 °C. Then, the dried crystals were prepared to 0.0250.1% seed suspension in methyl alcohol solution. Last, the smooth side (polished by sandpaper) of PDA-substrate was immersed into the prepared seed suspension for about 15 s, and then the seeded PDA-substrate (S-PDA-substrate) was carefully slid away and held vertically until dried in the air."
4,Synthesis of ZIF-8 membrane,"2.3 Synthesis of ZIF-8 membrane At first, the precursor solution for membrane synthesis was prepared by mixing zinc nitrate hexahydrate (0.11 g), 2-methylimidazole (2.27 g) and DI water (40 mL). Then, the dried substrates were vertically placed in a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave followed by the hydrothermal synthesis at 60 °C for 6 h. Finally, the obtained membrane was washed with methanol for three times, soaked in methanol solution for 24 h, and dried in air at 60 °C overnight."
5,Characterization and permeance measurements,"2.4 Characterization and permeance measurements 2.4.1 Characterization The crystalline phase of ZIF-8 membranes was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Ultima Ⅳ, Rigaku) with Cu-Kα radiation. The spectrograms were scanned in the range of 2θ = 5°–45° at a scanning rate of 4° min−1. The thickness and morphology of the samples were observed with Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM, SU8020, Hitachi), using an acceleration voltage of 5 kV. The Fourier Transform IR (FT-IR) spectra of the sample were achieved in the reflection mode in a Bruker Tensor 27. The surface roughness of the samples were evaluated by AFM (PARK company, model XE7). The element distribution was checked by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (E-MAX, Horiba) coupled with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, S-3400 N, Hitachi) using an acceleration voltage of 15 kV. 2.4.2 Permeance measurements Single gas permeation performance of H2, CO2, N2, and CH4, and C3H8 for ZIF-8 membrane were performed at 303 K with a pressure drop of 0.1 MPa using a dead-end system as described previously [43,44]. The membrane was installed in a stainless-steel module, and the upper and lower sides of the membrane were sealed by two silicon O-rings. The gas permeance was measured by using a soap bubble flow meter. Before the measurement, the gas in the pipeline needs to be blown away with testing gas. The single gas permeance Pi (mol·m−2·s−1·Pa−1) is calculated by Eq. (1): (1) Pi = Ni / A Δ P Ni (mol·s−1) is the gas permeate molar flow of component i, A (m2) is the effective surface area of the membrane, and △P (Pa) is the pressure drop across the membrane. The ideal selectivity (ISF) for Pi/Pj is calculated by Eq. (2): (2) IS F i / j = P i / P j The mixed gas separation experiment was performed on the Wicke-Kallenbach system (W-K) [39,45]. Ar gas with a rate of 100 mL min−1 is used as sweep gas and H2, CO2 and CH4 were used in the feed side. The composition of the permeated gas was analyzed on a gas chromatograph (GC-2014C). The feed gas was constant in a 1:1 vol ratio with a flow rate of 50 mL min−1. The separation factor (α) of the equimolar mixture permeation was defined as the quotient of the molar ratios of the components (H2, j) in the permeate, divided by the quotient of the molar ratio of the components (H2, j) in the retentate, as shown in following. (3) α H 2 / j = y H 2 , Perm / y j , Prem / y H 2 , Ret / y j , Ret"
6,Results and discussions,
7,Modification of by dopamine,"3.1 Modification of by dopamine Firstly, the PDA modified alumina substrates were obtained by simply immersing the alumina substrate into dopamine solution. After modification, the color of the substrate changed from white to brownish black, indicating that PDA was successfully deposited on the substrate (Fig. 2 ). This speculation was confirmed by FT-IR, which spectrums of the substrate modified with PDA and bare substrate (B-substrate) are all illustrated in Fig. 3 . The band at 3500–3300 cm−1 can be assigned to the ν(NH) and ν(OH) stretching modes. The two features at 1596 and 1511 cm−1 belong to νring (CC) and νring(CN) stretching modes, respectively. The existence of the above characteristic peaks and the reduction of OH at 3478 cm−1 confirms that PDA have been successfully grafted on the surface of the substrate (PDA-substrate) [46,47]. Fig. 4 compares the morphologies of the surface and cross-section of the substrates before and after modification. The surfaces of Al2O3 particles from B-substrates are extremely smooth, and the surfaces became rough after PDA was deposited [48]. In addition, the pore sizes of the support did not change from the view. It is consistent with the gas permeance results listed in Table 1 . To further verify the effect of modification, H2 and CH4 were used as probe molecules to check the gas transport. The permeance of H2 and CH4 decreased slightly from 82.9 × 10−7 to 81.9 × 10−7 mol·m−2·s−1·Pa−1, and 35.2 × 10−7 to 33.1 × 10−7 mol·m−2·s−1·Pa−1, respectively. Consequently, modification of PDA has only a negligible effect on gas transport."
8,Synthesis of ZIF-8 membrane,"3.2 Synthesis of ZIF-8 membrane ZIF-8 membranes were synthesized by vertically immersing the bare substrate (B-substrate), PDA-substrate and seeded PDA-substrate (S-PDA-substrate) into the precursor solution, respectively. Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of the ZIF-8 membranes prepared on the above substrates. The XRD spectrograms of three samples showed the characteristic peak at 7.5°, 10.5°, 12.8°, 14.8°, 16.7° and 18.2°, indicating that pure phase ZIF-8 membranes were synthesized on the above substrates. The membrane synthesized by in-situ synthesis method show the lowest XRD intensity. Compared with the membrane on PDA-substrate, the membrane on S-PDA-substrate exhibited the highest crystalline strength, demonstrating the coated seeds combined with PDA are beneficial to promote the growth of the membrane. Fig. 6 shows discontinuous membrane layers on B-substrate and PDA-substrate. Compared the morphologies of the ZIF-8 membranes synthesized on B-substrate and PDA-substrate without seeds. The inter-growth of the membrane on PDA-substrate was improved, but there were still more defects, as the position in red circle, leading to no selectivity. However, as showed in Fig. 9, more compact and continuous ZIF-8 layer grew on the surface of S-PDA-substrate and no apparent defects can be found on the membrane layer. Generally, the role of the coated seeds is to induce the crystallization on the substrates [30] and PDA can compensate for the uneven distribution of the seed layer and promote the heterogeneously nucleation [34]. Compared with previous similar works, the synthesized ZIF-8 membrane has a thinner membrane layer in this work."
9,Effect of seed concentration on membrane synthesis,"3.3 Effect of seed concentration on membrane synthesis Seed concentration is a critical factor for heterogeneous crystallization. Hence, the influence of the seed density was explored to optimize the conditions. As the seed concentration in the suspension increased from 0.025 to 0.1 wt%, the seed crystals on the PDA-substrates also increased, and the seed layer became more continuous with increasing seed amount on the substrate surface [49]. Compared with the seed crystals on the B-substrates (S-B-substrate)(Fig. 7 (a, b, c)), the PDA-substrate has a high seed converge with a more smoothly surface (Fig. 7 (d, e, f)), due to the adhesion function of the PDA. In order to confirm the results of SEM images, we chose the representative coating conditions with ZIF-8 concentration of 0.05 wt% on both substrates for AFM characterization. The AFM analyses of the substrates surface highlighted the smoothness of the S-PDA-substrate compared with S-B-substrate (Fig. 8 ). The average roughness (Sa) for S-B-substrate and S-PDA-substrate was acquired as 1.5294 μm and 0.2125 μm, respectively. It indicates that PDA can adhere to the seed during the crystal coating process, resulting in the uniform distribution of seed on the support surface. The seeds will aggregate on the substrate without PDA, leading to uneven seed distribution [50]. In addition, the EDX images of the B-substrate and PDA-substrate coated with ZIF-8 concentration of 0.2 wt% were shown in Fig. 9 . The EDX elemental mapping diagrams show the depth distribution of Zn in the cross-section of PDA-substrate coated with ZIF-8 crystals is shallower than that of B-support. Most seeds were concentrated on the PDA-substrate surface, while a large number of Zn was found in the pores of B-substrate, indicating that adhesive PDA can adhere seeds and prevent the seeds from entering into the support pores. Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 illustrate the SEM images of the membrane synthesized through seed-induced growth method with the help of 0.025 wt%, 0.05 wt%, and 0.1 wt% seed suspensions on B-substrate and PDA-substrate, respectively. The cross-section images of the obtained membrane were shown in Fig. 10 (d, e, f), along with the concentration of the seed suspension increased from 0.025 to 0.1 wt%, the membrane thickness increased from 650 nm to 1200 nm. From Fig. 11 (d, e, f), the cross sections of the membrane also showed the same change regulation, the membranes layer with thickness from 800 to 1400 nm were fabricated on the PDA-substrate with the concentration from 0.025 to 0.1 wt%. However, as illustrated in Fig. 11, the fabricated membrane demonstrated a thicker membrane layer than that on the B-substrates with the same seed suspension (Fig. 10). He et al. [51] reported ZIF-8 membranes synthesized on Zn (Ⅱ)-doped PDA modified support, Zn (Ⅱ)-doped PDA can promote ZIF-8 growth and act as a linkage layer to link the ZIF-8 layer and support. In this work, apart from the link function, PDA also can adhesion seeds on the support. More seeds are benefit for the nucleation, together with the promoting role of PDA layer, leading to a thinner membrane on S-PDA-support."
10,Gas permeation performance,"3.4 Gas permeation performance 3.4.1 Single gas permeation performance Table 2 illustrates the single gas separation performance of the membrane synthesized on S-B-substrate and S-PDA-substratewith different seed concentration. For M1-M3, the membranes were synthesized on S-PDA-substrates showed a high hydrogen permeance than 1.81 × 10−6mol·m−2·s−1·Pa−1, together with an ideal selectivity of above 11.3 for H2 and CH4. However, the membranes on S-B-substrate (M4-M6) showed a relatively low ideal selectivity and high permeance, but the idea selectivity for H2 and CH4 of M4, M5 and M6 is 3.9, 6.1 and 5.6, that is higher than its Knudsen value (2.8), demonstrating the membrane synthesized on S-B-substrate is also low-defect. In comparison, PDA played a beneficial role in preparing high intergrowth membranes. In addition, single gas such as H2, CO2, N2, CH4 and C3H8 was introduced to evaluate the quality of the prepared membrane (M2) on S-PDA-substrate. Fig. 12 shows the testing results through the membrane as a function of different dynamic diameter at 303 K and 0.1 MPa. Hydrogen has a maximum permeance of 1.81 × 10−6 mol·m−2·s−1·Pa−1 and the other gases such as CO2, N2 and CH4 present a decreasing permeance as the dynamic diameter increasing. The ideal selectivity for separating H2 from CO2, N2, CH4 and C3H8 are 4.1, 8.5, 11.3, and 294, respectively. Except for the selectivity of H2 and CO2, the others was higher than their corresponding Knudsen values of 3.7, 2.8 and 4.6, respectively, indicating that the obtained ZIF-8 membrane was thin and low defects. The low ideal selectivity of H2/CO2 is slightly less than its Knudsen value (4.7), this could be attributed to the fact that the molecular size of CO2 (0.33 nm) is smaller than that of N2 and CH4, and similar to the pore size of the ZIF-8 pore (0.34 nm). Moreover, due to the flexibility of the ZIF-8 lattice, CO2 easily penetrates through the membrane [52], resulted in a low idea selectivity of H2 and CO2. The gas permeance under variation of pressure drop across the membrane was also measured. As shown in Fig. 13 , the permeation of CO2 N2 and CH4 through the membrane is almost independent of the pressure drop across the membrane. The permeation of H2 increases slightly with the increasing of pressure. Jin et al. [53] reported this phenomenon maybe attribute to decrease the H2 permeation at higher H2 feed pressures, and the all-size exclusion of CO2, N2 and CH4 from the pores of ZIF-8. The result shows that the prepared ZIF-8 membrane is dense and no obvious pinholes and defects [45,54]. It was worth mentioning that the obtained ZIF-8 membrane keeps its high performance when the testing pressure increases from 0.1 to 0.4 MPa, demonstrating the fabricated membrane is very stable. The effect of temperatures on gas permeance and ideal selectivity was also performed. Improving temperature can increase the diffusion rate, and lead to enhance the gas permeance. As shown in Fig. 14 , however, the high temperature resulted in a low gas permeation for H2 and CO2 as previous [45,52,55,56]. Generally, adsorption effect plays a pivotal role in the membrane separation, the preferential adsorption gas can easily penetrate the membrane. Along with the temperature increasing, adsorption is greatly affected, causing the gas permeance slightly decrease. In addition, when the permeation temperature increased from 303 to 368 K under 0.1 MPa, the H2 permeance slightly decreased from 1.81 × 10−6 to 1.38 × 10−6 mol·m−2·s−1·Pa−1. However, based on the permeance results listed in Fig. 15 , as the temperature increasing (303–348 K), the ideal selectivity of H2/N2 and H2/CH4 remain almost unchanged, while the selectivity of H2/CO2 increases from 4.1 to 5.0. All the selectively decreased at 368 K due to the lower H2 permeance. Seifert et al. claimed the CC bond of the imidazole ligand and the center tunnel of the six member ring can afford visible hydrogen electrostatic binding conducive to adsorb H2 [57]. By molecular simulations and specific force-field parameters, the free energy of CO2 transfer through the ZIF-8 crystalline channels (9.9 kJ/mol) is lower than the isosteric heat of adsorption (14.19 kJ/mol) [58]. The CO2 adsorptive intimacy with ZIF-8 is ascribed to the strong quadrupole-π electrostatic interactions between the π electrons of the imidazole ring and the partial positive charge of the carbon on CO2 [59]. Hence, Lin et al. quoted the above conclusions incorporating the permeance of temperature dependent and claimed that the activation energy for diffusion is smaller than the heat of adsorption in ZIF-8 for both H2 and CO2 [60] . Our result is consistent with the above conclusions. The permeance of N2 and CH4 hardly effect with the operation temperature. This result is in accord with the “configuration diffusion transport mechanism” [36], demonstrating that the prepared membrane is dense and integrity by PDA modification and seed-induced growth method. 3.4.2 Mixed gases separation performance The molecular sieve performance of the as-prepared ZIF-8 membrane was further evaluated by the separating tests of the equimolar mixture of H2/CO2 and H2/CH4 at 303 K and 0.1 MPa. As shown in Table 3 , compared with the H2 permeance of single gas, the H2 permeance of H2/CO2 and H2/CH4 mixed system decreased from 18.12 × 10−7 to 10.07 × 10−7 and 8.58 × 10−7 mol·m−2·s−1·Pa−1, respectively. The low permeance may ascribe to the competition effect between mixed gases, the permeation of H2 is hindered mainly because the larger gas molecules diffuse much slower than H2 and they can occupy the pores in the membrane [61]. The permeance of CO2 and CH4 also decreased in the mixed gases, but CH4 permeance decreased even more. It is known that the kinetic diameter of CO2 (0.33 nm) is close to the window size of ZIF-8 (ca 0.34 nm), so both H2 and CO2 can pass through the membrane. However, due to the competitive effect, the gas (H2, CO2) penetration will be hindered and the permeance will decrease. In addition, the highly permeable H2 acts as a purge gas to promote the rapid passage of CO2 through the membrane, resulted in a lower separation factor in mixed gas separation than its ideal selectivity. However, for the H2/CH4 equimolar separation test, the separation factor is 15.3, which is increased compared with the ideal selectivity (11.3). In comparison to the decreasing of CO2 permeance in mixed gas separation, the CH4 permeance showed an obvious decline, due to the dynamic diameter of CH4 (0.38 nm) is larger than the pore size of ZIF-8 (ca 0.34 nm) and the competition between H2 and CH4 has a large impact on CH4 permeance, resulting in a promoting separation factor for H2/CH4. The long-term stability and thermal stability of the membrane were investigated for 105 h (at 303 K) and 55 h (373 K), respectively. As shown in Fig. 16 (a), the membrane showed a reliable long-term stability, maintained a high H2 permeance and separation factor for an equimolar H2/CH4 mixture at 303 K during the whole 105 h. At a high temperature (Fig. 16 (b)), because of the interaction of two component gases, after the stabilization time of 1 day, the H2 permeance was also independent of test time. However, the high temperature led to an increase in the diffusion rate of CH4 from the membrane, resulting in a lower separation selectivity of H2/CH4 than that of at 303 K [62]."
11,Comparison to literatures,"3.5 Comparison to literatures Numerous attentions have been focused on increasing the permeance of hydrogen with a better selectivity while maintaining the high selectivity. A comparison of the similar works in the literatures are shown in Table 4 . Pan et al. [63] prepared a high-flux ZIF-8 membrane on the ceramic hollow fiber, in which the H2 permeance was 15.4 × 10−7 mol·m−2·s−1·Pa−1. Lai et al. [64] prepared a defect-free ZIF-8 membrane on an α-Al2O3 substrates by the secondary growth method, where the thickness of the membrane is 2.5 μm, and the H2 permeance is 3.6 × 10−7 mol·m−2·s−1·Pa−1. Huang et al. [40] reported that the high-permeance ZIF-8 membrane on stainless-steel net (SSN) by dopamine modified the stainless-steel net, with a well H2/CH4 selectivity of 23.2, and the H2 permeance of 2.66 × 10−5 mol·m−2·s−1·Pa−1 because stainless-steel net (SSN) has large porosity, which greatly reduces the mass transfer resistance of gas molecules. All of the above works are using the same method to prepare ZIF-8 membrane, but the difference in substrates material leads to a large difference in gas separation, So, it is assumed that the substrates material has a great influence on the permeability of the membrane. But for the membrane α-Al2O3 substrates, it always shows a low gas permeance and the membrane thickness affects the membrane permeance. Compared with the other ZIF-8 and/or MOF membranes prepared on α-Al2O3 substrates, we successfully prepared high hydrogen permeance ZIF-8 membranes by seeding on PDA modified substrates method, due to a thin membrane layer with low mass transfer resistance. In addition, another factor for low mass transfer resistance is due to that PDA can prevent the seeds from entering into the pores of substrate, which can afford space for crystallization. And the crystallization in the pores can lead to large mass transfer resistance. Hence, the permeance of the obtained membrane is about one order of magnitude higher than that of similar substrate supported membrane."
12,Conclusions,"In summary, we have developed a very simple modification method that is coated seeds on PDA modification-substrate to prepare continuous and thin ZIF-8 membrane with enhancing hydrogen permeance. As PDA has abundant functional groups, ZIF-8 seed and ZIF-8 nutrients can be attracted and anchored on the substrate surface to promote the rapid growth of ZIF-8 layer to form a dense ZIF-8 membrane. And this method can effectively block the ZIF-8 crystal nucleus in the substrate pores, so that the membrane showed a low flow resistance and high H2 permeance. For single gas at 303 K and 0.1 MPa, the ideal separation factors of H2/CO2, H2/N2, H2/CH4 and H2/C3H8, were 4.1, 8.5 11.3 and 294.0, respectively. The ZIF-8 membrane also displayed a high H2 permeance of 1.8 × 10−6 mol·m−2·s−1·Pa−1, which exceeds most of the reported ZIF-8 membranes in the literatures."
