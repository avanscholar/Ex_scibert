0,Introduction,"Catalytic hydrogenation [1–41], hydrodeoxygenation [42] and hydroisomerisation [43–46] are important reactions, which attracted a lot of attention both in industry and academia. The most important properties for heterogeneous catalysts are activity, selectivity and stability. Especially, catalyst selectivity and stability are often limiting factors for industrial implementation of some processes, such as selective hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene [6,13,15,29,30,40] or phenol hydrogenation to cyclohexanone [18,32] and unsaturated aldehydes and ketones [37]. In the last decade a wealth body of research has been devoted to development of metallic nanoparticles with different shapes, such as cubic, octahedral and spherical ones. Several reviews report their preparation [47–53], highlighting for example also some new methods to prepare nanoparticles with different shapes, such as metal reduction under CO atmosphere giving cuboctahedron particles [11,14,17]. Since nanoparticles have a large surface to volume ratio, they have also high surface energy [52]. Metal nanoparticles also tend to form spherical or near spherical particles in order to minimize the total surface energy [52]. One example of this was the equilibrium shape of Ag single crystal, calculated by the effective medium theory showing that the main facets were (100), (110) and (111) [54]. Furthermore, it was shown that a modest partial rounding of the edges between (110) and (111) facets occurred due to a limited set marginally stable of high-index orientations. Furthermore, the particle size can partially predefine the proportions of different facets in metal nanoparticles, e.g. via utilization of the Wullf construction [18]. It has also been calculated that fcc metal particles exhibit six (100) and eight (111) planes in truncated octahedron at thermodynamic equilibrium [55]. Applicability of these novel catalysts in different reactions has also been shortly presented [2,7,9,12,13,15–18,20,22–24,27,28,31,34,39–46]. It is known that some nanoparticle metal catalysts have superior features as comparison to industrial counterparts due to their well designed properties, such is enrichment of a certain metal facet [18]. There are however, several parameters, which can affect the catalytic performance, including the particle size [12], acidity [12], electronic [15] and steric properties [15]. A fair comparison of the effect of different metal facets should be made by having the same size, acidity, electronic properties while changing only the shape of the particles, which explains why there are very few such studies [12,17,24]. It is also interesting to study whether reactions are structure sensitive, i.e. if the reaction rates are changing with the size of metal particles [56]. Among physical methods, which have confirmed the effect of different crystal facets, XRD [12,16], temperature programmed adsorption and desorption [13] and temperature programmed reduction [57] should be mentioned. Furthermore, DFT calculations have been intensively used to rationalize the experimental findings in catalytic reactions [4,9,10,14,29,30,39]. Special emphasis in the current work is put on reviewing the effect of the nanoparticle shape on catalytic performance in the presence of hydrogen, i.e. activity, selectivity and stability in hydrogenation, hydroisomerisation and hydrodeoxygenation reactions. In addition, the effect of the reaction conditions on activity and selectivity is addressed, e.g. hydrogen pressure and temperature will be discussed in depth. Furthermore, an easy catalyst preparation, catalyst reuse and stability, which are very important for the industrial application of these catalysts will be shortly discussed. Discussion in this work is divided by functional groups, i.e. triple and double bonds as well as carbonyl bonds with the aim to elucidate the origin of activity and selectivity changes and correlate it with the shape, size and facet effects. The ultimate aim in using model catalysts with the specific sizes and shapes is to provide guidelines for the rational catalyst design. It should, however, be stated here that generalization of the results is quite difficult, since it is known that structure sensitivity is reaction specific [41]. In addition long-term stability and deactivation of the catalysts with the active phase in the nano range will be addressed."
1,Synthesis of metal nanoparticles and supported nanoparticle catalysts,"The preparation of metal nanoparticles with different sizes and shapes has already been investigated for decades [58,59]. Several reviews can be found on synthesis of metal nanoparticles with different shapes [51,52] and therefore this issue is only shortly summarized here. Several methods exist for preparation of metal nanoparticles, such as impregnation-evaporation [18], precipitation-reduction [40], reverse-microemulsion [23], incipient wetness [51], and colloidal methods [15,51]. In incipient wetness method a metal salt solution is adsorbed on the support, followed by thermal reduction [51]. The main challenge in this method is a difficulty to produce monodisperse metal particles [51]. Colloidal synthesis with wet chemical reduction has been largely used [51]. This method includes the following steps: nucleation, growth, ligand capping/stabilization and immobilization of the metal nanoparticles on the support [51–53]. During nucleation, the metal ions are reduced in the solution forming zero valency metal atoms, which form small clusters. The latter ones are not very stable, but they can redissolve or alternatively in case the cluster exhibits an adequate radius larger than a critical cluster size, it becomes a thermodynamically stable metal seed [51]. The number of seeds can be regulated by changing the reduction rate. In the next step, the seeds are transformed to nanoparticles, which start to grow. Analogously to the first step, the rate for the particle growth can also be regulated. During this step, the particle shape can be tuned via addition of shape-directing agents, such as inorganic salts, organic ligands and polymers [51]. It can also be noted, that when metal nanoparticles are grown under the thermodynamic control, the nanoparticles attempt to minimize the total surface energy. In that case the lowest energy facets are formed. It has been reported in [60] that the surface energy of different metal facets increase in the following order: (111) < (100) < (110). Under kinetic control the metal nanoparticles with different shapes can be created, when shape-directing agents interact at the particle surface when the reduction rate is relatively slow. For example iodide can slow down the reduction rate, which in turn helps in avoiding longevity of crystals [61]. In colloidal synthesis of metal nanoparticles several stabilizers including for example polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) [39,45,51], polyacrylate [24,58], cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) [22,40], CTAC [62], sodium-di-2-ethylhexylsulfosuccinate [23], different capping agents, which selectively adsorb on certain metal facet, such as KBr [39,63], KCl [62], NaI [2] and different reducing agents, e.g. hydrogen [2], l-ascorbic acid [13, 16, 45, 61, hydrazine [23], HCHO [40], NaBH4 [2,64], hexamethylene tetramine [40], citric acid [62], CO [11,14], ethylene [17] have been used. Even more examples of additives and reducing agents can be found in [51,65]. The role of stabilizers is to avoid agglomeration of the noble metal particles [45,51], while capping agents are used to direct synthesis of metal nanoparticle with a particular structure. Activity of the shape directing agents is based on selective interactions with a specific facet, for example Ag+ is stabilizing (111) facet [51], while Br− is adsorbed preferentially on (100) facets [45]. For synthesis of Pt nanoparticles the effectiveness of different ions to act as a shape-directing agent has also been systematically studied by varying the Pt source, shaping and reducing agents as well as reaction conditions [65]. The results revealed that [Pt(OH)6]2- reduced with hydrogen was efficient to form cubic Pt nanoparticles under alkaline conditions [65]. Several parameters affect formation of shaped metal nanoparticles, such as the type of metal precursor [65], solution pH [65], temperature [2,77], the ratio between the concentration of the seed solution to the metal precursor [65], the ratio between two different capping agents [66], concentration of the surfactant [68], type of the reducing agent [2,22,40,65,68], metal salt [40,65] and surfactant [67]. In this work the details of the preparation of some shaped Pt [2,11,24,58,59] and Pd [13,15,18,22,23,38,39,40,63,64,67,68] particles, for which also reaction performance has been reported, are given below. For synthesis of Pt nanoparticles with a certain shape, some examples are given below (Table 2, entries 1–11). Cubic Pt nanoparticles were obtained using K2PtCl4 as a metal precursor with a small amount of PAA and NaI as a capping agent (Table 1 , entry 1) [2]. When the ratio between the metal precursor to PAA was smaller, cuboctahedral Pt particles were formed. On the other hand, a different metal precursor was used to produce tetrahedron and Pt nanowires (Table 2 , entries 3, 4). In this case Pt octahedron particles were obtained using a slow reduction with hydrogen while Pt nanowires were formed using NaBH4 as a reducing agent [2]. Analogously to [2], Pt(100)/C and Pt(111)/C were obtained with K2PtCl4 and H2PtCl4, respectively in [58,59] (Table 1, entries 5 and 6). Impregnation-evaporation method was also successfully used together with different gases as shape directing agents for synthesis of Pt nanoparticles [11,14,17]. It has been observed that for example the percentage of spherical particles increased with increasing CO concentration during reduction [14], while ethylene reduction promoted formation of octahedron Pt particles (Table 2, entry 11) [17]. Formation of different shapes of Pd nanoparticles has been investigated systematically in several publications (Table 2 entries 12–28) [40,45,63,66,67]. As well established the nanoparticle growth is dependent on the nucleation and growth rates. When seeds are used to produce metal nanoparticles [63,66], the shape control could be obtained by adding different amounts of the seed solution and keeping the amount of the metal precursor for example Na2PdCl4 constant. Furthermore, synthesis time and temperature affect shape and size control (Table 1, entries 12 and 13) [63,66]. Different shapes were formed by starting from formation of cubes with (111) facets followed by truncated cubes, cuboctahedrons, truncated octahedrons and octahedrons containing mainly (111) facets [66]. The shape evolution occurred by deposition of Pd2+ on Pd(100) surface (Table 1, entry 13). It is known that (100) facets have a higher free energy than (111) facets [60] contributing to a higher growth rate along (111) direction when the cube is transformed to the octahedron [66]. The reduction rate of the Pd precursor affects the nanoparticle size, i.e. higher reduction rates afford more seeds and thus smaller particle sizes [66]. The reduction rate of Pd2+ can be varied by also changing the ratio between KBr and KCl [66], since Cl− exhibits weaker interactions with Pd2+ than Br−. A larger nanoparticle size was obtained, when using an excess of KBr, because less Pd nuclei were formed than in the presence of KBr or with a higher amount of KCl. The corresponding particle sizes were 12 nm and 9 nm, respectively [45]. It is known that Br− is adsorbed preferentially on (100) facets and the crystal growth along (100) orientation is enhanced [45]. Smaller Pt cubes could be obtained when NaI was used as a capping agent and the synthesis temperature was increased, which is related to a higher number of Pt nuclei at a higher temperature (Table 1, entry 1) [2]. Tetrahedral palladium particles were obtained by the precipitation reduction method in the absence of a stabilizer, for example using Al and Mg nitrate solutions combined with a reducing agent, hexamethyltetramine (HMT) together with PdCl2 solution (Table 1, entry 18) [40]. Thereafter, during synthesis, which was performed at 150 °C for 6 h, reduction of the Pd precursor with HMT occurred (Table 1, entry 18) [40]. Spherical particles, were prepared via impregnating the support, for example layered double hydroxides, with Na2PdCl4 using formaldehyde as a reducing agent (Table 1, entry 20) [40]. The support was prepared by hydrolyzing the magnesium nitrate – aluminium nitrate solution with hexamethylene tetramine [40]. On the other hand, octahedral particles were obtained when a stabilizer, CTAB was added to the mixture of Mg and Al nitrates with hexamethylene tetramine and PdCl2 followed by crystallization. Thereafter CTAB surfactant was removed and the catalyst was dried at 70 °C (Table 1, entry 19) [40]. It was reported that Br− ions in CTAB bind more strongly to Pd(100) than to Pd(111) and truncated octahedral particles are formed in the presence of a high concentration of CTAB and a lower concentration of formaldehyde as a reducing agent [81]. It is known that ascorbic acid is a weak reducing agent [68] and facilitated formation of cubic Pd particles from Na2PdCl4 in the presence of PVP (Table 1, entry 24), while octahedral particles were formed when large Pd seeds and formaldehyde as a reducing agent were applied (Table 8, entry 25) [38]. In addition, hexagonal particles were formed using a high ratio of CTAB/ascorbic acid (Table 1, entry 26) [22]. The final step in the synthesis of active metal nanoparticle catalysts is to remove stabilizers and capping agents [13], which can block access of the reactant to the active site diminishing the catalytic activity [45]. The surfactant should also be removed after nanoparticle synthesis, for example PVP is removed with hydrogen peroxide treatment [45], ethanol washing [38] or calcination at 350 °C when Pt nanoparticles were supported on SBA-15 [70]. Furthermore, CTAB was removed via ethanol washing [40] and calcining the catalyst at 400 °C [18]. One challenge in removal of capping agent and surfactant is that nanoparticles can become less stable [13,25]. When for example the organic residue was removed from the cubic Pd particles via cyclic H2-O2 treatment [13], it was revealed that Pd(100) facets in cubic Pd were transformed at 190 °C to Pd(111) facets. The formed particles are most probably in a form of the truncated octahedron [69]. When an extra reduction with NaBH4 was made to remove PVP, the Pd particles aggregated [25]. Thus it was suggested in [25] that an appropriate amount of the residual PVP is necessary in metal nanoparticles to retain their shape and size."

3,Selective hydrogenation of acetylene,"3.1 Selective hydrogenation of acetylene Selective hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene [2,13,15,16,29,30,40] has been intensively studied over various supported Pd nanoparticles with different shapes. In addition the experimental work has been supported by DFT calculations [4,29,30] and several characterization methods, e.g. XRD [16], in situ XRD [4], adsorption studies with Raman spectroscopy [2], temperature programmed reduction [13] and desorption [13] to elucidate the reaction mechanism. Acetylene hydrogenation was investigated over three different types of Pd particles exhibiting spherical, tetrahedral and octahedral shapes supported on hydrotalcite in the temperature range of 40–100 °C (Fig. 1 ) [40]. The Pd particle sizes were relatively large and for tetrahedral Pd mainly (111) facets were present as confirmed by HRTEM. An excess of cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) during the synthesis resulted in truncated octahedral Pd particles due to selective adsorption of Br− ions on Pd(100) surface. The octahedral Pd particles contained both (111) and (100) facets. Furthermore, spherical Pd particles exhibited a mixture of different facets. The results from acetylene hydrogenation (Table 2) show that these octahedral and tetrahedral Pd particles displayed the highest turn-over frequencies (TOF), while spherical particles with a mixture of different Pd facets were two fold less efficient. These results indicated that the octahedral and tetrahedral Pd particles with a high amount of corners, edges and faces were very active in acetylene hydrogenation. Higher catalytic activity of the two former catalysts prepared by the precipitation reduction method (see Section 2) was in agreement with the observation that the ethylene desorption peaks for them were 5−9 °C lower than for the spherical Pd particles. The lower peak in ethylene desorption was associated with π –bonded ethylene. The second peak related to di- σ -bonded ethylene corresponds to desorption at a higher temperature forming either ethylene or ethane via recombination [71]. It was stated that ethylene species were desorbed more easily from the tetrahedral Pd surface in comparison to other surfaces. Analogously to the results of [40], large octahedral Pd particles (22 nm) on carbon exhibiting Pd(111) facets were also selective (75 % selectivity) in acetylene hydrogenation at 20 °C, contrary to 2 nm spherical Pd particles (Fig. 2 ) [15]. This catalyst exhibited also high stability (Section 7). As well established [72,73] Pd can act as a hydrogen storage material forming α and β phases of PdH hydride at H/Pd ratio of 0.03 and 0.6, respectively. The latter phase corresponds to Pd4H3. According to [15] ethene can adsorb better on the open Pd4H3(100) surface than on spherical Pd particles with (111) facets. In acetylene hydrogenation it was experimentally observed that the PdAg alloy has been very selective towards ethene formation due to the ability of Ag to block (100) sites leaving (111) sites available. This effect diminishes ethene adsorption and inhibits Pd4H3 phase formation. Furthermore, the barrier for ethylene hydrogenation based on DFT calculations was also lower for Pd(100) surface than over Pd(111) (Table 3 ) indicating that the latter is more selective towards ethylene [15,30]. Interestingly, the change in acetylene selectivity was also observed over Pd/C catalyst exhibiting spherical Pd particles with different facets, i.e. selectivity to ethylene decreased with increasing hydrogen pressure over this catalyst, while for large Pd particles with octahedral shape comprising mainly Pd(111) only a minor selectivity drop with increasing pressure was observed (Fig. 2) [15]. This was explained by the phase change of α and β phases, which was theoretically confirmed to occur at a certain hydrogen pressure [15]. It was stated that the pure Pd phase has a higher selectivity to ethene than the Pd4H3 phase with the phase changes occurring at 0.1 bar of hydrogen pressure. Opposite to the above reported results, cubic Pd particles with (100) facets supported on Al2O3 were highly active and selective in acetylene hydrogenation when comparing their performance with the spherical Pd particles of the same size and with Pd(111) facets (Table 2) [13]. These results are in agreement with temperature programmed hydrogen desorption data showing that cubic Pd particles exhibited a lower hydrogen desorption peak by 5 °C related to subsurface hydrogen formed with Pd. This hydrogen facilitated effective acetylene hydrogenation. In addition ethylene desorption studies demonstrated that cubic Pd catalysts favored adsorption of C2 species with di- σ -bonding on two Pd atoms while the spherical Pd particles promoted stronger adsorption of C2 with the perpendicular and parallel modes over more than 3 Pd atoms [13]. The results of [13] were opposite to those obtained via DFT calculations [30], showing that Pd(100) surface has the lowest activity for acetylene hydrogenation, while Pd(111) exhibited higher activity and selectivity. It was, however, also shown that the presence of subsurface carbon changes reactivity and selectivity in acetylene hydrogenation. In addition according to DFT calculations [29] Pd(100) with carbide exhibits higher activity and selectivity in acetylene hydrogenation as compared with Pd(111) (Fig. 3 ). Pd hydride was also reported to be less stable in Pd(100) than on Pd(111) [29]. In addition, carburization of Pd(100) and Pd(111) surfaces was experimentally studied with ethylene as a component in the gas mixture between 100–150 °C using in situ XRD as a tool [4]. The results revealed that carburization of Pd(100) surface occurred much faster than that of Pd(111) surface. Furthermore, DFT calculations point out on different electronic and geometric properties of nanoparticles after carburization. Strong interactions of acetylene with Pd(100) surface in comparison with Pd(111) were confirmed leading to C-C scission in acetylene and incorporation of carbon into the Pd lattice. In continuous hydrogenation of acetylene at 100 °C over cubic and octahedral Pd/SiO2 the carburization rate normalized by surface Pd was 5.5 fold faster for the former catalyst [38]. For cubic Pd/ZnO and Pd/SiO2 with both exhibiting 18 nm Pd particles and containing Pd(100), the initial conversion was low for the latter catalyst, increasing when the PdCx phase was formed. Furthermore, it was estimated that when about the same amount of either Zn or carbon (2.3 wt%) was incorporated into Pd lattice, its lattice parameter distortion exerted and at the same time the corresponding TOF were 29 s−1 and 25 s−1. On the other hand, when octahedral Pd/ZnO or Pd/SiO2 with the Pd size of 37 nm and mostly Pd(111) facets, were used in the same reaction, the initial conversion levels were about the same giving TOF values of 58 s−1 and 55 s−1 [38]. This result indicates that formation of either PdZn or PdCx is hindered over Pd(111) surface. Furthermore, it was stated that most probably interactions of acetylene with Pd(100) are stronger than with Pd(111) resulting in a higher TOF for the latter one. Carburization rates were also considered in [38]. The authors emphasized that when the nanoparticle size is larger than 15 nm, the carburization rate is only correlated with the shape effect. In [38] the Pd particle sizes were 18 and 37 nm for the cubic and octahedral particles, respectively, indicating that the particle shape is the only factor determining carburization rate established by in situ XRD. On the other hand, carburization rate was very low for both cubic and octahedral Pd supported on ZnO. In that case a PdZn alloy was formed prior to PdCx which explains a low carburization rate."
4,"Selective hydrogenation of 1,4-butynediol to 2-butene-1,4-diol and 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol to 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol","3.2 Selective hydrogenation of 1,4-butynediol to 2-butene-1,4-diol and 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol to 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol Hydrogenation of 1,4-butynediol in an aqueous solution was also investigated at 50 °C under 20 bar hydrogen giving 67 % conversion and ca. 99 % selectivity to 2-butene-1,4-diol over Pd nanoparticles supported on metal organic framework ZIF-8 [31]. It was stated that the Pd nanoparticles, prepared with polyvinylpyrrolidone as a capping agent together with KBr and ascorbic acid, formed nanocubic metallic Pd with the size of 4–6 nm. Furthermore, the shape of Pd particles did not change when they were immobilized on ZIF-8. This catalyst gave nearly complete conversion of 1,4-butynediol in 30 min at 50 °C under 20 bar hydrogen and ca. 98 % selectivity to 2-butene-1,4-diol, while unsupported cubic Pd nano-sol particles required nearly 4 h to obtain complete conversion. The low rate is partially caused by aggregation of Pd particles during the reaction. The reason for higher activity and selectivity to 2-butene-1,4-diol is the encapsulation of Pd nanoparticles inside the ZIF-8, which blocks the edge and vertex sites of Pd in comparison to terrace sites. These less coordinated edge and vertex sites are known to facilitate double bond hydrogenation [40,74]. The supported Pd-ZIF-8 was successfully recycled in the hydrogenation of 1,4-butynediol. Selective hydrogenation of 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol to 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol was performed at 60 °C under 2.8 bar hydrogen over various Pd nanoparticles prepared using either sodium di-2-ethylhexylsulfosuccinate [23] or cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide as surfactants [22] for synthesis of spheres and hexagons, respectively. It was demonstrated that the highest initial TOF was obtained with spherical particles of 13 nm and that the initial TOF decreased for spherical particles with decreasing Pd cluster size. Furthermore, the lowest TOF was displayed by the hexagonal shaped Pd particles. This result indicates that large particles exhibited a higher activity. When, however, the fraction of Pd(111) was calculated for Pd particles of different sizes based on the surface statistics [75], the initial TOF calculated per number of (111) facets was independent on the size and shape of Pd particles. In addition, the initial selectivity to 3-methyl-3-buten-2-ol was very high being nearly the same for all studied catalysts varying in the range of 95–96 %. Furthermore, unsupported Pd particles with different shapes and sizes were also used in hydrogenation of 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol under similar conditions by Semagina et al. [23]. The results showed that selectivity to 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol was independent on the particle size and shape at 50 % conversion, as alkyne adsorption strength is higher in comparison with alkene and therefore the alkyne can block the active sites [76]. When conversion exceeds 50 %, alkyne coverage is decreasing and is thus not sufficient to maintain a very high selectivity to alkene. The latter can only be obtained with large Pd particles exhibiting a cubic or an octahedral structure. In these Pd particles very few edge sites are present. Selectivity to 3-methyl-3-buten-2-ol decreased at 95 % conversion with decreasing particle size from 94 % with 18 nm cubic Pd particles to only 74 % over 5.3 nm cuboctahedral particles with the highest fraction of edge sites [41]. It was also stated in [41] that it is possible to rationalize catalyst design for a specific reaction via applying kinetic modelling and simulations. On the other hand, it is well-known that structure-sensitivity is reaction specific [77] and the results obtained for hydrogenation of alkyne cannot be generalized for other reactions."
5,Shape selective effects in hydrogenation of ethylenic bond,"Shape selective hydrogenation of ethylenic double bonds has been demonstrated in furan [25], phenol [18], cyclohexene [2] 1-hexene [2], trans-stilbene [2,39] and buta-1,3-diene [33] hydrogenation. Shape dependent effects in furan hydrogenation have been scarcely studied [25]. The same effect on catalytic activity in stilbene hydrogenation at 60 °C under 2 bar hydrogen in ethanol was studied over Pt cubes, cuboctahedrons, tetrahedrons and nanowires. The results revealed that TOF decreased as follows: Pt cube > Pt cuboctahedron > Pt tetrahedron > Pt nanowire reflecting the fraction of Pt(100) facets in the catalysts [2]. Furthermore, initial TOF both for cis- and trans stilbene hydrogenation increased with increasing Pt particle size and the initial TOF for cis-stilbene was 4–8 fold that for trans-stilbene. The higher initial TOF was explained by a stronger electron donation for ethylene on Pt(100) facets in comparison to Pt(111) facets [78] which was also confirmed in [2] with Raman spectroscopy with adsorption of trans-stilbene both on Pt cubes and tetrahedrons. In the former case Pt cubse showed larger red shifts for both adsorption of olefin and phenyl groups [2]. In addition, the carboxylic group in sodium polyacrylate interacts with vacant d-orbitals of Pt surface. It was confirmed by XPS that Pt cubes rich in Pt(100) facets exhibit a higher binding energy of O1s of PAA in comparison to Pt(111) facet. Thus a lone pair oxygen of CO can donate electrons more for Pt(100) making Pt nanocrystals more electron accepting and facilitating higher initial TOF values for hydrogenation of the ethylenic double bond [2]. It is known that the electron transfer can occur from the ethylenic double adsorbed parallelly via π–bonding mode bond to Pt surface [78]. It was also shown that Pt cube catalyst could be recycled three times without any structural changes (see Section 7). Hydrogenation of trans-stilbene exhibited also a strong facet dependence over shaped Pd catalysts (Table 3, entry 5, 7) [39]. In [39] analogously to [2] it was observed that Pd nanocubes rich in Pd(100) facets were very active in trans-stilbene hydrogenation, while a very slow reaction was observed over Pd nanosheets containing Pd(111) facets and tetrahedrons exhibiting (111) planes of the size ca. 37 nm (Table 4 , entries 1–4) [39]. A low hydrogenation rate of trans stilbene over Pd(111) surface was confirmed by calculating the energy barrier to reach transition stage 1 according to the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism for Pd(111) and Pd(100). The results showed that the former one was 0.8 eV while the latter one was only 0.53 eV [39]. Furthermore, the energy barrier from the intermediate step to the transition stage 2 was lower for Pd(100) in comparison to Pd(111). Opposite to stilbene hydrogenation, TOF was not changing substantially in cyclohexene and 1-hexene hydrogenation under at 60 °C under 2 bar hydrogen in ethanol over different Pt shaped catalysts [2]. Analogously, it was observed in [1] that formation of cyclohexane in benzene hydrogenation at 100 °C in the gas phase was not structure sensitive over cubic Pt nanoparticles with Pt(100) facets and octahedral Pt nanoparticles with both Pt(100) and Pt(111) facets. On the other hand, cuboctahedral Pt particles with Pt(100) and (111) facets promoted formation of both cyclohexane and cyclohexene, while only cyclohexane was formed over cubic Pt(100) catalyst indicating strong nanoparticle shape selectivity in benzene hydrogenation [1]. These catalysts were prepared using tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide as a capping agent. In addition only cyclohexane was formed over cubic Pt particles, while both cyclohexane and cyclohexene were formed over octahedral particles. Ethylene hydrogenation at 25 °C was also demonstrated to be structure insensitive over supported on SBA-15 Pt nanoparticles prepared via the solution –based reduction method with either ethylene glycol as a reducing agent or polyvinylpyrrolidone as a surfactant. The Pt particle size was varied in the range of 1.7–7.1 nm and Pt exists in several crystal structures, i.e. (111, (200) and (220) [70]. Structure sensitivity was also investigated in the hydrogenation of 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol at 43 °C under 4.5 bar hydrogen in ethanol over Pd cubes and spheres supported on Al2O3 [36]. The results revealed that a higher TOF was obtained for spheres composed of (100) and (111) facets together with edges and vertices, while for cubes containing mainly Pd(100) facets the TOF was only 66 % of that for spheres. Based on surface statistics for fcc metal crystals of cubic and cuboctahedral phases [75], it is possible to calculate the amount of different exposed facets in different shaped nanoparticles. It was thus hypothesized that the most active particles in this reaction would the tetrahedrons containing only (111) facets in their terraces [36]. Selective hydrogenation of buta-1,3-diene at 20 °C under 20 bar hydrogen in heptane as a solvent was also investigated over different shaped Pt nanoparticles (prepared using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as a surfactant) supported on alumina (Fig. 4 ) [33]. The results revealed that at 60 % conversion the selectivity to butenes decreased as follows: 92 % for Pt catalysts containing 66 % of Pt(111) followed by Pt-polyhedron with selectivity 83 % and containing 55 % Pt(111) facets and 72 % with cuboctahedron Pt particles containing ca. 20 % Pt at corners and edges [33]. The selectivity to butenes was not be evaluated as a function of metal particle size in [33], since only the size of cubotetrahedral particles was successfully determined to be 6 nm, while no statistical analysis of Pt particle size was performed for cube-polyhedron and polyhedral Pt catalysts. Furan hydrogenation to tetrahydrofuran was studied over Pd nanocubes and octahedron wires in the temperature range of 25–50 °C under 40 bar hydrogen in ethanol [25]. The results showed that the Pd nanocube catalyst with Pd(100) facets of the size of 7.5 nm were more active than Pd(111) facets in octahedron shaped particles with the size of 8.1 nm. The former ones exhibited 1.8 fold higher TOF in comparison to the latter ones. In [25] the enhanced hydrogenation activity over Pd(111) facets was explained by formation of stronger bonds between reactants or intermediates of the metal surface [25] analogously to [79] in nitrile hydrogenation. In addition to the shape effect these catalysts contained also different amounts of the residual carbon. Despite four fold more carbon in nanocubes than in octahedron particles, the former exhibited a higher catalytic activity in comparison to octahedron. Removal of residual carbon was considered to be important as otherwise it can suppress hydrogenation (see Section 2). Mechanistic aspects of nanoparticle shape selectivity have been studied in selective phenol hydrogenation to cyclohexanone using cubic, spherical and octahedral Pd particles supported on non-porous TiO2 in water at 90 °C under 5 bar hydrogen (Fig. 5 ) [18]. It is known that the majority of facets in a spherical particle are of (111) type [18] producing mainly cyclohexanone in phenol hydrogenation [32]. On the other hand, unsupported cubes of the size of 22 nm exhibited Pd(100) facets as confirmed by the selected area diffraction (SAED), while octahedral Pd particles contain Pd(111) facets. The catalytic results over different TiO2 supported Pd nanoparticles exhibiting different shapes showed that cubes, octahedral and spheres with the Pd metal size of 22 nm, 26 nm, and 26 nm, respectively, gave nearly the same conversion, while the selectivity was different. Over all three catalysts cyclohexanone was initially the main product, while over Pd spheres and Pd octahedral particles with Pd(111) facets cyclohexanone rapidly reacted further to cyclohexanol. On the other hand, the further reaction of cyclohexanone was limited to ca. 10 % formation of cyclohexanol over cubic Pd particles with (100) facets (Fig. 6 ). The experimentally confirmed activity and selectivity of Pd(100) facets present in Pd/TiO2 in hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone were interpreted by DFT calculations. The latter revealed that phenol was adsorbed differently on Pd(111) as compared with its adsorption on Pd(100) surface, namely in a planar mode [18]. C1 and C2 in the phenol ring are adsorbed on the same surface metal atom in Pd(111) via π-bond analogously to C4 and C5 which are adsorbed on another surface atom. On the other hand, adsorption of C3 and C6 in phenol occurs by the σ-bond. Phenol adsorption on Pd(100) happens through the π-bond involving C3 and C6 while the rest is adsorbed by the σ-bond. The activation barrier for hydrogenation of cyclohexanone was lower for Pd(111) than for Pd(100) in line with the rapid hydrogenation of cyclohexanone over spherical Pd particles containing Pd(111) facets."
6,Selective hydrogenation of carbonyl group in aromatic compounds,"Size and shape selective effects in hydrogenation of a carbonyl bond have been intensively investigated in the recent years [7,9,12,14,17,19,20,24,27,45]. The shape effect is more pronounced for the compounds which have strong electron density in the carbonyl group, such as benzaldehyde [12] or compounds possessing steric limitations to adsorb the CC double bond as in cinnamaldehyde in comparison to crotonaldehyde [24]. It is also known that Pt has different electronic properties in comparison to Pd [80] and thus shape selectivity is more pronounced in selective CO hydrogenation in the case of unsaturated aldehydes as demonstrated below [14]. Selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CAL) was studied over Pt nanoparticles supported on carbon and exhibiting different shapes, which were prepared by the colloidal method using sodium polyacrylate as a capping agent [57,58]. The cubic and tetrahedral Pd particles exhibited nearly the same size, 9−10 nm, and different Pd facets, e.g. Pt(100) and Pt(111), respectively confirmed by cyclic voltammetry [24]. The highest TOF was obtained with Pt/C exhibiting cubic Pt particles with (100) facets followed by Pt/C containing tetrahedral and hexagonal Pt particles with (111) facets. The lowest TOF was displayed by the polyoriented Pt/C catalyst with a small particle size (Table 5 , entries 1–3) [24]. The highest selectivity to cinnamylalcohol (COL) was obtained with Pt(111)/C, while Pt(100)/C showed slightly lower selectivity (Fig. 7 ). This result can be explained by the Pt particle size, i.e. by the difficulty of adsorption of the CC double bond on the Pt surface when there are repulsive interactions between the phenyl ring and large Pt particles. Such interactions are absent in Pt/C with a small particle size [81]. The shape effect, i.e. formation of the unsaturated alcohol on Pt(111) in comparison to Pd(100) facets when the metal particle size is the same, was explained by not favorable CC hydrogenation over dense (111) terraces [24]. In the case of simultaneous adsorption of CO on (111) terraces and CC on the steps, formation of unsaturated alcohols is unfavored. Adsorption of CO proceeds via di- σ bonding on (111) terraces and adsorption of ethylenic double bond via the π mode on the steps. It was also interesting to note that when these catalysts were applied to crotonaldehyde hydrogenation, only 4 % crotylalcohol was formed over Pt(111)/C catalysts, while the main product was butyraldehyde. Apparently presence of a methyl group instead of the phenyl group in cinnamaldehyde, i.e. absence of a steric hindrance, was limiting adsorption of the CC bond via repulsion on large Pt particles. Furthermore, it should be stated here that the supported colloidal Pd nanoparticles on carbon material were very stable in ca. 110 h time-one-stream after initial deactivation in vapor phase crotonaldehyde hydrogenation at 60 °C [24]. Opposite to the results of [24], the highest TOF was obtained in cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation over tetrahedral Pd nanoparticles supported on hydrotalcite exhibiting Pd(111) facets (Table 5, entries 9–11) [27], while with both Pd(100) and Pd(111) being present in spherical and octahedral Pd particles, a lower TOF was obtained. In cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation nanocubes gave lower selectivity to COL due to favoring adsorption of the reactant via the π -bond of CC. The highest selectivity to COL was obtained with Pt/C octahedral particles with the size of 6.2 nm exhibiting Pt(111) surface [11,17], while selectivity to COL decreased when using Pt/C catalysts reduced with CO at 200 °C and exhibiting the cube form with high amounts of Pt(100) with ca. the same Pt size of 6.3 nm (Table 5, entries 4–6, Fig. 7). Pt/C reduced at 500 °C had a cuboctahedron shape, while Pt/C particles reduced with hydrogen were spherical [11,17]. In [11,17] the interplay between the size, shape, initial TOF and selectivity to COL has been clearly demonstrated. These differently shaped Pt nanoparticles were prepared using a special gas phase synthesis, e.g. treatment with CO [11] and ethylene as a capping agent [11,17]. Nano-octahedra Pt particles supported on carbon were produced via the wet impregnation method and reduced with the ethylene-hydrogen gas mixture, while the cube form and the spherical Pt/C were obtained via reduction with CO and H2, respectively. It is known that CO and hydrogen are able to cap Pt(111) and stepped surfaces and suppress growth of Pt(100) facets [11]. All three catalyst types exhibited nearly the same particle size of 6–7.4 nm and the same XPS peak energy of 71.4 eV. In addition supported large concave Pt nanocubes were also active for cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation giving high selectivity to cinnamyl alcohol, 83 % at 54 % conversion (Table 6 , entry 12) [34]. Only two papers were found in the literature where cinnamylalcohol selectivity was compared for different Pt particle shapes exhibiting the same particle size and conversion level. The results show clearly that Pt(111) facets in tetrahedral [24] and octahedral particles [17] displayed both the highest initial turn-over frequency (Fig. 8 a, Table 5, entries 13–20). At the same time, the selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol was higher with larger metal particles (Fig. 8b). Pd is typically forming easily saturated alcohols opposite to Pt. Several different types of Pd nanoparticles were used in cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation [14]. It was experimentally confirmed that CAL was hydrogenated to hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL) very rapidly over Pd/C, while this catalyst was not active for HCAL hydrogenation to hydrocinnamylalcohol (HCOL) (Fig. 9 ). Furthermore, cinnamylalcohol (COL) could not be detected in cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation over Pd/C catalyst because further transformations of COL to HCOL were very rapid over Pd/C catalyst [14]. The results of [14] showed that TOF increased with increasing the fraction of Pd step sites (Fig. 10 a) giving a high yield of HCAL, while high selectivity to HCOL was promoted by flattened Pd particles and large palladium clusters of ca. 13 nm (Fig. 10b). The desired non-spherical Pd particles with the flattened shape can be synthesized by reduction with hydrogen. Such catalysts promote CO reduction, opposite to CO reduced catalysts with a spherical shape and a stepped surface, which are active in CC hydrogenation. The formation of more stepped sites was confirmed both with the Wulff construction and IR spectroscopy [14]. In the selective hydrogenation of a carbonyl group in acetophenone for production of 1-phenylethanol a very high rate and selectivity to the desired product were obtained over Pt-Fe-nanowires [35], which promoted adsorption of CO while adsorption of the phenyl ring was inhibited due to the steric hindrance (Fig. 11 , Table 5, entries 21, 22). These nanowires can be synthesized using cetyl trimethylammonium chloride as a capping agent (see Section 2). On the other hand, for synthesis of nanocubes octadecanamine is used as a capping agent. When hydrogenation of benzaldehyde was performed over 8 nm Pd particles supported on silica –alumina, alumina and silica under 3 bar hydrogen at 25 °C in 2-propanol it was expected that the TOF values should be the same when these catalysts exhibited the same particle size, metal dispersion and the lattice structure containing Pd(111) and Pd(200) [12]. This was not, however, the case as the TOFs decreased as follows: Pd/silica-alumina > Pd/SiO2 > Pd/Al2O3. This result was stated to be originated from different acidity of the catalyst because silica–alumina supported Pd catalyst exhibited stronger acid sites in comparison to Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/SiO2. Furfural hydrogenation was investigated over different Pt nanoparticles exhibiting different sizes and shapes (Fig. 12 ). The catalysts were prepared with PVP as a capping agent [70]. Selectivity to furfuryl alcohol was dependent on the Pt particle size and shape, namely larger Pt particles favored formation of furfuryl alcohol. When the sizes of octahedral, cubic and polyhedral Pt particles were approximately the same, i.e. 6–7 nm, selectivity to furfuryl alcohol decreased as follows: octahedral > polyhedral >> cube [19]. The authors did not discuss specifically existence of different facets in nanoparticles of different shapes. In addition to hydrogenation also decarbonylation occurred being promoted by small Pt particles (Fig. 13 ). Furthermore, the cubes were more selective towards furan formation followed by polyhedral and octahedral particles. Typically cubes exhibit low index facets [24] resulting in lower selectivity to carbonyl hydrogenation in comparison to Pt(111) which represent a dense surface. Larger Pt particles also possess more metal like properties favoring CO hydrogenation [19]. In hydrogenation of 2-ethylanthraquinone over Pd nanoparticles supported on γ -Al2O3 a clear shape effect was observed when TOF for cubic Pd / γ -Al2O3 with Pd(100) facets was 1.9 fold higher than for octahedron Pd/ γ -Al2O3 with nearly the same size (Table 5, entries 26, 27) [9]. This catalyst was also highly selective towards CO hydrogenation. It was shown by DFT calculations that Pd(111) facets were more active towards CC hydrogenation due to a shorter distance of Pd-C from Pd(111) surface in comparison to Pd(100) surface."
7,Shape effects in other reactions catalyzed by metal particles in the presence of hydrogen,
8,Hydroisomerisation of alkanes,"6.1 Hydroisomerisation of alkanes The effect of the metal particle size and shape has been scarcely investigated [45,46]. The authors investigated Pd/Beta catalysts in heptane hydroisomerisation at 240 °C under 40 bar hydrogen in a fixed bed reactor [45]. Selectivity determined at 30 % conversion over all catalysts increased for the cube catalysts with decreasing the metal particle size and smaller particles gave higher selectivity to 2- and 3-methylhexane (Table 6, entries 4–6). An increase of the metal particle size resulted in the acidity increase (Fig. 14 ). The highest selectivity for heptane conversion varying in the range of 30–36% was obtained with a mild acidic catalyst exhibiting small cubic Pd metal particles. It should, however, be pointed out here that the dataset is rather limited to draw any further conclusions about the shape effect, since also acidity is changed. The best catalyst exhibited both mild acidity and a small particle size (Fig. 14), which are beneficial for hydroisomerisation of alkanes [82]. A clear size effect on catalytic properties of the cubic Pd catalysts can be explained involving hydrogen temperature programmed desorption data, namely an increase in the position of the temperature for hydrogen desorption in the first low temperature peak with increasing the metal particle size. Such peak in hydrogen TPD corresponds to the subsurface hydrogen desorption, while is known to be much easier from (111) surface in comparison to (100) surface. Taking into account XRD, it was concluded that the lowest temperature for subsurface hydrogen desorption is attributed to truncated octahedral Pd particles exhibiting both (111) and (100) facets, while the latter one results in hydrogen desorption at a higher temperature. The above-mentioned results can be well correlated with [57] that Pd(111) facets exhibit a higher hydrogen uptake in comparison to (100) planes [41]. In order to explain the obtained results with Pd(111) facets displaying higher activity, hydrogen TPD can be used as a tool to study adsorption energy for hydrogen on different crystal surfaces of Pd in [57]. For that purpose the Kissinger equation (1) l n T m a x 2 β = - E A R 1 T m a x + K was used in which β is heating rate, Tmax maximum temperature in hydrogen TPD, R gas constant, 8.3143 J/(Kmol) The activation energy EA is obtained by plotting l n T m a x 2 β vs. 1000/Tmax with the slopes giving activation energy for hydrogen desorption. These results were correlated with those obtained by DFT calculations. The results revealed that Pd(100) exhibited a lower desorption activation energy for hydrogen in comparison to Pd(111), being 108 kJ/mol and 126 kJ/mol, respectively [57]. The effect of Pt nanoparticle shape was also clearly identified in hexadecane hydroisomerization at 280 °C under 40 bar hydrogen when the conversion of hexadecane varies in a narrow range of 30–34 % (Table 6, entries 1–3) [46]. Different shaped Pt/zeolite catalysts were prepared with the method reported in [44,68] (see Section 2). The highest conversion [46] was obtained over octahedral particles containing Pt(111) facets followed by spherical Pt particles with Pt(111) and Pt(100) facets while the lowest conversion was achieved with cubic Pt(100) particles. Selectivity towards the C16 isomer increased with an increasing amount of Pt(111) facets (Fig. 15 ). This result was correlated with hydrogen temperature programmed desorption, namely that the lowest temperature for hydrogen desorption peak was observed for Pt(111) in octahedral particles. Such peak can be assigned to decomposition of Pt-hydride species having a high impact on activity and selectivity in hydroisomerization. It was also pointed out [46] that a proper balance between the metal and the acid function is required for the catalyst to be selective in hydroisomerization, with the most selective catalyst exhibiting also the highest acid/metal ratio. The shape selective effect was very prominent in butene isomerization at 102 °C using Pt nanoparticles supported on silica of the site ca. 5 nm [43]. Since the stability of adsorbed cis-2-butene was higher than of trans-2-butene, isomerization of trans to cis occurred and TOF for this transformation increased with increasing the amount of Pt(111) facets, i.e. cubic Pt was the least active followed by spherical and tetrahedral Pt particles. The latter ones exhibited the highest TOF (Table 6, entries 8–10). It was also experimentally observed using TPR and RAIRS techniques as well as theoretically confirmed by DFT calculations that Pt(111) sites are very active towards formation of the cis olefin. Furthermore, different Pt facets exhibited different rates for isomerization of trans – to cis butene and vice versa [43]. Isomerization of butene was studied at 100 °C under low hydrogen partial pressure. The results showed that when Pt nanoparticles supported on silica xerogel were calcined at low temperatures, below 250 °C, higher rates for trans to cis transformation were observed for tetrahedral particles, while high temperature calcination of the same particles gave lower trans- to cis isomerization rates compared to cis to trans rates [44]. The high temperature of calcination of tetrahedral particles reduced the fraction of Pt(111) facets. It should be, however, observed here, that these results have been obtained over Pt supported on silica xerogel, which is not very acidic. Under these experimental conditions no C8 hydrocarbons were formed via bimolecular mechanisms opposite to the product distribution obtained over zeolites [83]."
9,Hydrodeoxygenation of aldehydes and alcohols,"6.2 Hydrodeoxygenation of aldehydes and alcohols Hydrodeoxygenation of furfuryl alcohol, benzyl alcohol and furfural was investigated over encapsulated Pd nanoparticles inside a TiO2 matrix [42]. The results were very promising giving high TOF, HDO selectivity and catalyst stability. The highest selectivity to methyl furan was obtained over Pd encapsulated in the TiOx matrix. This catalyst exhibited small pores (4.8 nm) of reducible TiO2 film over 4 nm Pd nanoparticles with Pd(111) facets and it is known that partially reduced oxide creates oxygen vacancies which activate CO bond breakage [84]. In particular, the Pd particle size remained unchanged during furfural HDO at 235 °C under 1 bar (see Section 7) [42]. The Pd nanoparticles were prepared using Pd(acac)2 as a precursor together with oleylamine and triethylphosphine under an inert atmosphere at 250 °C. Thereafter, the washed nanoparticles were encapsulated in TiO2 as follows: redispersion and mixing with CTAB as a stabilizer at 45 °C, followed by a slow addition of tetrabutyltitanate at room temperature and synthesis at 25 °C for 24 h."
10,Stability of metal nanoparticles,
11,Thermal stability of metal nanoparticles,"7.1 Thermal stability of metal nanoparticles Thermal stability of metal nanoparticles has been investigated using in-situ transmission electron microscopy operating under vacuum [85]. The aim was to study the morphological changes of Pt nanoparticles supported on amorphous silica as a function of temperature [85]. The results showed that cubes changed to truncated particles at 350 °C, and to spherical ones at higher temperatures. At very high temperatures spreading of Pt particles occurred. Based on these results it was recommended that these Pt nanoparticles are suitable for low temperature, below 250 C, multi-path reactions [85]. Thermal stability of cubic Pd nanoparticles was also studied under different gas atmospheres at different temperatures [13]. It was interesting to observe that cubic Pd particles changed to spherical ones during a cyclic O2-H2 treatment at 137 °C [13]. Cubic Pd particles were stable when they were heated in 50 %-50 % mixture of H2-N2 from 100 °C to 130 °C, while at 160 °C cubic Pd particles were started to change to spherical ones [13]."
12,Stability of nanocatalysts in catalytic reactions,"7.2 Stability of nanocatalysts in catalytic reactions Stability of the metal nanoparticles has been investigated in several reactions, such as hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde [14], acetylene [16], cyclohexene [2], cyclohexanone [18], ethyl anthraquinone [9], ethylene [70] as well as in heptane hydroisomerisation [45] and ethane hydrogenolysis [70]. Catalyst deactivation can occur due to coking [16], or leaching [9]. In addition the metal crystal phase [16] or morphology [16] can be changed during a reaction. The long-term stability of cubic Pd(100) particles (ca. 20 nm) supported on multilayer graphene was investigated in partial hydrogenation of acetylene using an excess of ethylene in the reaction mixture [16]. The results showed that acetylene conversion decreased slightly from 92 % to 84 % during 127 h time-on-stream, while selectivity to ethylene decreased from 78 % to 4% during the same time due to changes in the catalyst morphology (Fig. 16 ). The reason for the selectivity decline in acetylene hydrogenation at 30 °C with increasing time-on-stream was that Pd facets changed during the reaction, as determined by e.g. XRD for Pd nanoparticles supported on graphene [16]. It was observed that Pd(100) facets were transformed to Pd(111) with increasing time-on-stream, while metallic Pd was retained confirmed by XPS analysis. This catalyst was prepared using PVP as a surfactant and ascorbic acid as a reducing agent with Na2PdCl4 under sonication at 80 °C for 10 min. Immobilization on graphene was followed by washing and drying under vacuum [16]. It was stated that the energy gained during binding of acetylene to the catalyst surface facilitates a break of the metal bond. Subsequently Pd atoms are pulled out from the initial surface forming a stepped Pd surface decreasing selectivity towards ethylene formation. The size and shape of tetrahedral Pd with mainly (111) facets and octahedral Pd particles with (111) and (100) facets supported on hydrotalcite were retained after acetylene hydrogenation in the temperature range of 50–100 °C, while spherical Pd particles prepared by a traditional impregnation method containing different facets were prone to agglomeration [40]. On the other hand, a stable catalyst performance was observed in continuous acetylene hydrogenation over Pd/C catalyst containing octahedral Pd(111) facets during 4 h time-on-stream (Fig. 17 ) [15]. In addition, a robust performance of PVP stabilized Pt nanoparticles supported on SBA-15 was obtained in ethylene hydrogenation at 25 °C and ethane hydrogenolysis at 370 °C [54]. The catalyst stability was elevated by calcination at 350 °C prior to use. In several cases under relatively mild reaction conditions neither metal leaching [18,28] nor the particle size or shape changes [2,14] occurred. Such behavior was observed in furfural hydrogenation at 50 °C under 5 bar of hydrogen in 2-propanol, with Pd/CMK (mesoporous carbon) catalyst exhibiting the cluster size of 2.5 nm. The catalyst was prepared via sol-immobilisation of Na2PdCl4 with PVA as a capping agent. Reduction of the colloidal particles was done with NaBH4 followed by immobilization via adjusting the pH to 2 with sulphuric acid, and finally washing and drying [28]. No Pd leaching occurred from octahedral 26 nm Pd particles supported on TiO2 in cyclohexanone hydrogenation at 90 °C in water under 5 bar of hydrogen [18]. This catalyst was calcined at 400 °C before testing. In the third case high stability of the spherical Pd nanoparticles with the size of 7.4 nm containing a high amount of Pd(110) facets was observed in three consecutive cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation runs at 35 °C under 2.5 bar hydrogen in distilled water [14]. This catalyst was prepared by the impregnation method using Pt(acac)2 as a precursor and SiO2 as a support under stirring for 1 h, after which the solvent was evaporated and the catalyst was dried at 80 °C for 12 h prior its reduction with CO at 200 °C. Removal of CO was done before the reaction by hydrogen flushing at 200 °C [14]. In addition, no catalyst restructuring of Pt nanocubes was seen in cyclohexene hydrogenation at 60 °C in ethanol [2]. On the other hand, Pd leaching occurred from cubic Pd supported on Al2O3 during hydrogenation of ethyl anthraquinone in trioctylphoshate-benzene as a solvent at 50 °C under 2 bar hydrogen after 70 h [9]. This catalyst was prepared form Na2PdCl4 in the presence of PVP and l-ascorbic acid and after synthesis reduced at 300 °C with Ar/H2 mixture. In [9] however, only minor leaching was noticed for the in-situ prepared catalyst. In this method γ -Al2O3, KBr, PVP and l-ascorbic acid were simultaneously put into an autoclave and the nanocatalyst was synthesized at 80 °C for 3 h, followed by washing, drying at 120 °C under vacuum, calcination and reduction at 300 °C with Ar/H2 prior to the catalytic reaction. This catalyst exhibited both cubic and irregular Pd particles with the particle sizes slightly higher than for the cubic Pd. It was recommended [9] that the in situ preparation method facilitates nanoparticle formation inside γ -Al2O3 pores, shielding them from agglomeration. Very promising results on Pd nanoparticles stability were obtained in n-heptane hydroisomerization, which was performed in a continuous reactor under 40 bar of hydrogen at 240 °C [45]. The cubic Pd particles supported on Beta zeolite retained their size and morphology after hydroisomerization [45]. It was also pointed out that the catalyst was reduced with hydrogen prior to its use. In addition Pd nanoparticles encapsulated inside TiO2 exhibited very high stability during HDO of furfuryl alcohol at 170 °C under 1 bar, while agglomeration of TiO2 supported Pt nanoparticles prepared via the incipient wetness method occurred under the same conditions [43]. This result indicates that encapsulated Pt nanoparticles within TiO2 are very stable."
13,Future outlook,"Based on the performed literature overview several research needs could be identified. It is proposed that an interdisciplinary approach to study model catalysts (Fig. 18 ), combining synthesis, characterization, testing and application of theory should be applied. In shaped catalysts synthesis several challenges were identified, including costs [57], limited batches of nanoparticles [86], a lack of scale up studies [57], different metal facets [57], stability of nanoparticles against different gas atmospheres [13] and temperature [85]. Nanoparticle stability is closely related to removal of ligands and capping agents, which in turn can limit catalytic performance [43]. From the reaction viewpoint the most important parameters are size, shape and conversion level. In order to properly separate different variables, comparative experiments by varying shape while keeping the size constant and vice versa should be performed. A very important factor is that in multipath complex reactions it has already been shown that the shape selectivity can be absent below 50 % conversion, while it can exist above that level [41]. Thus, kinetic experiments showing activity and selectivity as a function of conversion are required to perform kinetic modelling. One challenge is also, that structure sensitivity is reaction specific limiting rationalizing the results to other reactions. The literature review shows that the reaction scope should be broaden from hydrogenation more to other hydrogen assisted reactions, such as hydrocracking. Furthermore, the effect of different parameters, such as the size, shape and acidity of the catalyst should be clearly separated performing systematic studies when only one parameter is changed at a time. In addition to kinetic modelling, another theoretical tool is DFT modelling giving a possibility to confirm experimentally obtained results and propose plausible reaction mechanisms [4,9,10,14,29,30,39,70]. The fourth pillar in interdisciplinary approach is catalyst characterization, especially under in situ conditions, which facilitates understanding structural changes occurring during the reaction [13,16]. Furthermore, characterization results, such as hydrogen TPD and TPR together with DFT modelling have already proven their strength giving activation energies for hydrogen adsorption, desorption [57], possible energy barriers for formation of different compounds [15,30], etc. Even coking effects have been understood via applying these tools [29]. It can be concluded, that an interdisciplinary approach in using model catalysts with specific surface properties can bring new knowledge for industrially important reactions and these results can be further confirmed by single crystal studies and applied to industrial catalysts."
14,Conclusions,"The effect of the nanoparticle shape on activity and selectivity was summarized for hydrogenation, hydroisomerization and hydrodeoxygenation of various compounds, such as acetylene, 1,4-butynediol, 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol, stilbene, phenol, 1,3-butadiene, cinnamaldehyde, acetophenone, furfural, heptane, hexadecane and butene. In addition catalyst stability in these reactions was also elucidated. The results clearly confirmed presence of the metal size and shape effects in several reactions. In acetylene hydrogenation both cubic Pd(100) and Pd(111) phases exhibited high turn-over frequency. It was, however, shown in continuous acetylene hydrogenation that Pd(100) facet changed to Pd(111) one during 127 h time-on-stream and at the same time selectivity to ethylene decreased. Furthermore, coking was shown to change the properties of Pd nanoparticles. Furthermore, DFT calculations revealed that Pd carbide phase exhibits a lower energy barrier to form ethylene in comparison to coked Pd(100). In selective hydrogenation of a triple bond in 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol to the corresponding alkenol the shape selectivity was observed only above 50 % conversion due to strong adsorption of alkyne inhibiting this effect under low coverage. The most selective Pd catalyst was composed of cuboctahedral particles with the size of 5.3 nm containing Pd(111) facets. The origin for high activity of this surface is due to its higher adsorption energy for hydrogen and higher hydrogen uptake in comparison to Pt(100) surface. In cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation dense Pt(111) exhibited the highest selectivity to cinnamyl alcohol. Analogously to cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation also Pt(111) facets were selective to formation of C16 isomers from hexadecane due to highly active. However, opposite to cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation smaller metal particles gave higher C16 isomer selectivity. In hydrogen assisted hydroisomerization of hexadecane was also more selective with slightly smaller octahedral Pt(111) supported on a zeolite, while larger cubic Pt(100) particles were less active and selective. These results were also correlated with the peak for hydrogen desorption at a lower temperature compared to Pt(100). The lowest temperature for hydrogen desorption peak observed for Pt(111) in octahedral particles facilitated efficient decomposition of Pt-hydride species. These species enhanced both catalyst activity and selectivity in hydroisomerization. On the other hand, the highest selectivity for heptane hydroisomerization was obtained with a mild acidic catalyst exhibiting small cubic Pd metal particles when the conversion was varying in the range of 30–36 %. It should, however, be pointed out that both metal and acid sites play significant roles in the hydroisomerization reaction and more systematic studies are required. Despite substantial progress in synthesis of supported metal particles of a particular shape and size, evaluation of catalytic behavior clearly lags behind. In addition to systematic variation of different parameters, such as shape and size, also further reactivity studies are proposed together with long-term stability tests. Kinetic modelling and theoretical calculations combined with advanced catalyst characterization can additionally elucidate the origin of activity/selectivity enhancement over specific metal nanoparticles. Since structure sensitivity is reaction specific, generalization of the results, such as metal particle size is not straightforward suggesting that further studies should be made."
