0,Introduction,"Globally, human consumption of products and services is on the rise due to population growth and urbanization. Manufacturing basic chemicals and intermediates for a wide variety of products requires a staggering number of resources, raw materials, and processing steps. Moreover, our planet must confront many challenges such as depletion of fossil-based raw materials, price fluctuations on fuel products, environmental pollution, and increased greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) [1–3]. Thus, renewable feedstocks are sustainable and environmentally benign solutions for the global problems [4]. Biomass is one of the promising and alternative raw materials in minimizing the dependency on fossil-based oil and coal reserves [5]. Biomass is abundant, easily stored and transported, currently offers more than ~ 10% of the global energy supply and ranks top among the four energy sources in terms of the world’s energy consumption [6]. Biomass is converted by thermochemical and catalytic processes to a wide spectrum of renewable platform molecules and intermediates for different industrial applications. These biomass-based platform molecules are foreseen as value-added compounds in manufacturing polymers, biofuels, synthetic and functional chemicals [7]. In this context, furfural (FA) and levulinic acid (LA) are the two main platform molecules studied widely in the production of biofuels, monomers and biochemicals [7,8]. Further, the furfural (FA) is commonly produced via hydrolysis of hemicellulose or pentose-rich polysaccharides (a low-cost and widely available). It was reported in 2020, the world’s production of FA is about 280,000 tons/year [9]. A wide variety of hydrogenated products were produced from the catalytic conversion of FA such as furfuryl alcohol (FOL), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFOL) and 1,5 pentanediol (PDO), respectively (Fig. S1a) [10]. Among them, THFOL is one of the potential intermediates which was used in many industrial applications. It is a non-petroleum based chemical feedstock and it can be directly used as a solvent and synthetic chemical in industrial processes. There is a considerable interest from scientific community on the direct upgradation of furfural to THFOL using the catalytic conversion method. Industrially, THFOL was produced in two steps i.e., FA hydrogenation to FOL and in next step, FOL to THFOL over an expensive noble metal catalyst. However, many challenges still exist in manufacturing THFOL at commercial scale in one step. Thus, developing a non-noble metal catalytic system for one-step selective THFOL production is environmentally friendly and sustainable. Significant progress had been made in the catalyst development in the furfural hydrogenation to THFOL. The noble metal catalysts are the most reported ones in the literature, such as Ru, Rh, Pd, and Pt supported catalysts are employed in the furfural hydrogenation to THFOL [11]. However, the noble metal-based catalysts had few significant drawbacks such as high cost and limited reserves, thus, making them commercially not viable for large-scale applications. Therefore, many researchers are developing inexpensive non-noble metal based catalysts, i.e., Ni or Cu-based catalysts [12]. The hydrogenation of FA to THFOL proceeds through the formation of furfuryl alcohol as an intermediate product. Liu et al. reported mono- and bimetallic Cu-Ni/CNT catalysts in FA hydrogenation and exhibited highest activity in complete conversion and THFOL selectivity (90.3%) due to synergistic effects of Cu-Ni bimetallic phases provided by the efficient hydrogen transfer mechanism over CNTs [12]. In another study, a facile prepared carbon embedded Ni nanoparticles selectively transformed the FA into THFOL, which are uniformly distributed over organic ligand derived carbon support [13]. Over Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, almost complete conversion, and selectivity with high TOF values were achieved over nano-sized Ni particles. The correlation of size-dependent with activity is reported widely in the scientific literature [14]. A highly dispersed immobilized Ni-Co bimetallic alloy over SiO2 structure was prepared. The ultrafine nano-sized Ni-Co bimetallic provided a synergistic effect which exhibited the high activity in FA hydrogenation to THFOL [15]. A Ni-Cu catalyst supported on mesoporous hectorite was prepared with Ni:Cu ratio of 1:1 and exhibited complete conversion and THFOL selectivity of 95% was gained at 140 °C and 40 bar H2 pressure after 4 h of reaction due to the optimal ratio for alloy formation with smaller crystallite size of Cu phase [16]. Typically, Levulinic acid (LA) was produced from biomass materials and it can be produced more efficiently from cellulose and hemicellulose via acid catalyzed hydrolysis reaction [17]. LA is an important platform molecule and is used in many industrial applications. The transformation of LA to a wide range of useful products can be produced such as chemicals, intermediates, solvents, and fuel additives, respectively [18,19]. Generally, the hydrogenated products of LA are γ-valerolactone (GVL), valerate acid (VA), 1,4-pentanediol (1,4-PDO), and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF) (Fig. S1b). Catalytic hydrogenation of LA to GVL was studied over noble, non-noble, and bimetallic catalytic systems in both continuous and batch reactor systems under various reaction conditions [20]. Most of the studies are focused on non-noble metal catalysts due to their cost and abundance [21]. The Ni-based catalysts are one of the most promising alternative to the noble metal catalysts, which have shown high performance in the hydrogenation reactions [22]. Singh et al., studied the facile prepared high surface area Ni/NiO catalyst, which is magnetically separable and reusable, and displayed highest LA conversion and GVL selectivity due to high Lewis & Brønsted acidity [23]. The structural and chemical properties are key in preparing a highly active and stable catalyst. A bimetallic Cu-Ni nano-alloy catalyst was prepared by stepwise solvothermal, co-precipitation, and impregnation methods and exhibited a high conversion over 99.3%. The Cu-Ni tuned for better electronic properties and synergistic effects provided by active sites for the LA hydrogenation [24]. In another study, facile synthesized cobalt embedded in N-doped carbon matrix was prepared by coordination precipitation and pyrolysis methods. The as-prepared Co@N-C-800 catalyst shown superior performance in LA hydrogenation due to the synergistic effects of Co, nitrogen and oxygen atoms over the carbon matrix [25]. Most of the studies are dealt with the physico-chemical properties correlated with the reactivity and activity such as acidity-activity, support-metal interactions, synergistic effects of bimetals and structural-activity. The reported Ni-based catalysts possess few major drawbacks such as low stability, catalyst deactivation, low activity, and inactive in harsh reaction conditions, and hard to prepare bimetallic-based catalysts-s. In this work, we designed and prepared a highly dispersed Ni nanoparticles embedded in the carbon support catalyst (Ni@C) were investigated in the hydrogenation of furfural and levulinic acid. A complete reaction scheme for both reactions that is hydrogenation of furfural and levulinic acid were presented in the Supplementary information as Fig. S1a and b."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and methods,"2.1 Materials and methods The list of chemicals used in this work are as follows: 2, 4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (98%) (Aladdin), Hexamethylenetetramine (98%) (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., ltd), Nickel (II) Acetate (98%) (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., ltd), Pluronic P123 (Sigma Aldrich), Ammonium hydroxide (30%) (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.), and deionized water. All the chemical reagents were commercially available in analytical purity and used without further purification."
3,Preparation of Ni@C nanocomposite,"2.2 Preparation of Ni@C nanocomposite In a typical synthesis [26], a 3.08 g of 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 0.6 g of ethylenediamine, 0.934 g of hexamethylenetetramine and 3.5 g of Pluronic P123 (a symmetric triblock copolymer) were dissolved in a 80 mL of distilled water. Herein, the triblock copolymer is used as a sacrificial agent to produce the carbonized mesoporous framework. The solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave of 120 mL capacity, sealed, and heated up to 130 °C for 4 h. The obtained polymer gel was washed three times with distilled water and dried overnight at 50 °C. The polymer gel was then carbonized via slow-pyrolysis by heating up to 800 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C/min for 3 h under N2 flow of 50 mL/min (99.9% N2 purity from Praxair India, Ltd.) to obtain the final mesoporous carbon. The pyrolyzed sample was cool down under N2 flow with similar flow rate and the obtained sample is denoted as P@C. A 5 g of polymer product was re-dispersed in 100 mL of dilute ammonium hydroxide solution i.e., 80 mL of H2O and 20 mL of ammonium hydroxide containing 0.623 g of Ni (II) acetate salt and stirred under hot bath at 50 °C for 6 h. In the next step, the final precipitated product was collected by filtration, and washed several times with deionized water and dried overnight at 50 °C designated as Ni@polymer. Finally, Ni@C sample was obtained by pyrolysis under N2 flow at 600 °C with a rate of 2 °C/min for 2 h. In the final step, the sample was cool down to room temperature under N2 flow. A reference catalyst Ni/AC were also tested in similar conditions and made a comparison with the lab made Ni@C catalyst."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/Max2500V/PC powder diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source operated at 40 kV with a current of 100 mA. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption (N2 physisorption) isotherms were measured on an ASAP-2020 instrument (Micromeritics) at −196 °C. Before the measurement, the sample was degassed at 250 °C for 4 h under vacuum. The specific surface area was calculated by a multipoint Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The Ni loading was measured by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, ICPS-8100 instrument, Shimadzu) with a Plasma-Spec-II spectrometer device. The sample were calcined in air at 500 °C for 2 h to remove the carbon impurities or any traces of contamination and the final residue was dissolved in aqua regia. The aqueous solution was introduced into the sample holder. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images were taken on a FEI Tecnai G2 F30 Spirit microscope operated at 300 kV. The sample grid was prepared by ultrasonically dispersing the sample in ethanol solution and depositing droplets of sample suspension on a carbon-enhanced copper grid, and then dried in air under a UV-lamp. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDX) images were taken on a Philips Fei Quanta 200F instrument operated at 20 kV. The sample was placed on a conductive carbon tape affixed to an aluminum sample holder and coated with Au. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on TA instruments Q-500, the sample was heated from room temperature to 800 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min under air with a flow rate of 100 mL/min. Carbon-Hydrogen-Nitrogen-Sulfur-Oxygen (CHNS-O) elemental analysis were performed using a Horiba EMGA 930 instrument to determine the ultimate analysis and exact amounts of C, H, N, O and S elements. We used L-Cystine (C6H12N2O4S2) analytical grade (Ultra-pure 99.5%, CAS: 56-89-3, Aladdin) as a standard substance for the CHNS analyzer calibration. The exact composition of each element is known from the standard material. We did 3 replicates and calculating the calibration ‘K’ factor by analyzing the standard substance (known elemental composition). Taking the average of three replicates with ± 0.3% SD was measured in each analysis. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis were measured with an ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer (Thermofisher) using monochromated Al Kα X-ray radiation (1486.6 eV) for which the samples were attached to the conductive carbon tape and mounted onto a sample bar. We have used Xpspeak41 software for the spectra deconvolution and peak fitting. The binding energies are corrected using carbon as a standard reference (B.E calibration) peak of C1s B.E 284.6 eV. We used linear background in treating the baseline in Xpspeak41 software. The peak fitting of the XPS data is done by the Gaussian-Lorentzian fitting function and the proportion is (20:G, 80:L). The hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) analysis was conducted on a AutoChem 2920 (Micromeritics) instrument. For the TPR experiments, a 0.05 g of sample was placed in a U-shaped quartz tube. The catalyst was mounted on a quartz wool plug in the tube. Prior to the TPR experiment, the catalyst was pretreated with N2 gas flow of 30 mL/min at 200 °C for 1 h. After the pretreatment step, the sample was cool down to ambient temperature and the TPR experiments were carried out under 5 vol% H2/Ar flow (30 mL/min) and temperature ramping from 30 to 700 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min and dwell for few minutes until steady state gained. Finally, cool down to RT and the H2 consumption was measured based on the TPR peaks at different temperature zones (denoted as low, medium, and high temperature regions, respectively). The hydrogen (H2) chemisorption experiments were measured by dynamic method on a AutoChem 2920 (Micromeritics, USA) instrument. Prior to adsorption measurements, 0.05 g of sample was reduced under 5 vol% H2/Ar flow (30 mL/min) at 400 °C for 2 h and flushed with He flow (50 mL/min) for 1 h at a similar temperature. After flushing, the temperature was cool down to room temperature, and in the next step, injecting the pulses of H2 from a calibrated online sampling valve onto a He streamflow over the reduced samples at room temperature. The H2 consumption values were calculated and measured based on the area of the peaks."
5,Catalytic activity,"2.4 Catalytic activity 2.4.1 Hydrogenation of furfural and levulinic acid Catalytic hydrogenation of both i.e., furfural (FA) and levulinic acid (LA) was performed in a 25 mL stainless steel autoclave reactor with an inserted glass liner. The type of solvent, reaction temperature, and the applied H2 pressures were different for both reactions. The reaction temperature was controlled by using an oil bath on a digital hotplate with a thermocouple. For hydrogenation of FA & LA, a 0.05 g of catalyst, 10 mL of isopropanol solvent, 5 mmol of furfural and 50 μL of decane as an internal standard for GC were initially introduced into the reactor. Subsequently, the autoclave reactor was purged with H2 gas before the reaction test. Prior to the activity test, the catalyst sample was activated ex-situ in 5% H2/Ar flow (30 mL/min) at 400 °C for 2 h and then transferred to the reactor under inert atmosphere (N2) to avoid any contact with air. The reaction pressure was subsequently adjusted to an initial value of 3 MPa by using a backpressure controller measured at room temperature and then the reactor was heated to desired reaction temperature (i.e., between 80 and 140 °C) with a stirring rate of 700 rpm. The reaction products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent, DB-WAX column) and further liquid by-products were analysed by GC–MS column (Agilent DB-WAX). To study the recyclability of the catalyst, at the end of the hydrogenation reaction run, the catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture by simple centrifugation, thoroughly washed with ethanol, and dried at 60 °C under vacuum for 6 h. A reference catalyst Ni/AC was also tested in similar conditions and compared the results with the as-prepared Ni@C catalyst (preparation details are included in the Supplementary information (SI)). The experimental details for LA hydrogenation are given in the Supporting information."
6,Results and discussions,"The initial characterization of the as-prepared P@C and Ni@C catalyst was analyzed using XRD, CHNS-O, BET surface area, TGA and FESEM techniques. The TGA-DTA curves of as-prepared Ni/polymer gel are presented in the supplementary information (Fig. S2) and indicated that the sacrificial template decomposes completely between the temperature range of 100 °C and 350 °C, respectively. Moreover, results from thermal analysis, there is no significant weight loss of catalyst was noticed after 350 °C. Only a minimal loss of catalyst weight was observed due to the loss of surface hydroxyl, loosely bonded water molecules and other organic precursors decomposition was evident at lower temperatures i.e., below 350 °C. The elemental composition of Ni@C catalysts are as follows: carbon (87%), hydrogen (2.7%), nitrogen (2.8%), S (not found) and oxygen (13.5%) were determined by C, H, N, S and O analysis. From the ICP analysis, ~ 12.7 wt% of Ni loading was detected in Ni@C catalyst. The XRD patterns for both as-prepared & reduced Ni@C catalysts were shown in Fig. 1. The broad peak located at 23° could be ascribed as (002) plane of the carbon matrix. For the fresh sample, both NiO and metallic Ni phases were noticed. For the Ni@C (as-prepared), the diffraction peaks at 37.26°, 43.34° and 62.83° were correspond to (111), (200) and (220) planes of NiO phases (JCPDS-04-0835) [27]. While the diffraction peaks at 44.49°, 51.85° and 76.38° are assigned to metallic Ni sites (JCPDS 65-2865), which corresponds to (111), (200) and (220) planes of metallic Ni particles, respectively [28]. The formation of Ni metallic phase and NiO phases are possible due to the partial reduction of nickel oxide species during the pyrolysis. It is evident that most of the XRD peaks are much broader for the Ni@C sample. This indicates that the relatively small size immobilized nickel crystallites were formed over the scaffold. After H2 reduction, the complete transformation of oxide species (i.e., NiO) to more organized and uniformly distributed Ni metallic state was dispersed over the carbon structure. Thus, none of the NiO diffraction peaks were observed in the reduced sample (Fig. 1). Based on the XRD patterns of Ni@C(R), the nickel particle size was calculated by Scherrer's equation, and the obtained values were summarized in Table 1. From the calculation, the average Ni crystallite size was around 8.3 nm. Fig. 2 depicted the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distributions calculated by BJH method for P@C and Ni@C samples. The BET specific surface area, total pore volume, and average pore diameter are summarized in Table 1. The P@C polymer structure possess moderately a high surface area of around 658 m2/g and a cumulative pore volume of 0.81 cm3/g due to carbonization and volatilization. The pore size distributions derived from the desorption isotherms, which were calculated by using Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method, indicated that the average pore diameter of P@C is 4.3 nm. The overall textural properties for both samples exhibited a similar isotherm (Fig. 2a, b) and represented a mesoporous type material. From Fig. 2a, type IV isotherm behavior was confirmed with a sharp capillary condensation step above the relative pressure of p/p0 = 0.4 was observed and thus, a typical characteristic feature of a mesoporous structure. The sorption isotherms do not level out in a plateau at relative pressures i.e., p/p0 > 0.9, indicating the existence of macropores. Moreover, it was noted that after nickel incorporation, the BET surface area, the pore volume, and the average pore size decreased slightly. Thus, it indicates that highly dispersed Ni particles might partially cover the surface of the carbon matrix. The HR-SEM and corresponding STEM images of Ni@C (as-prepared) are presented in Fig. 3. The micrographs displayed a high surface homogeneity, and the Ni particles were distributed evenly over the carbon support and exhibited a narrow particle size distribution with controlled ultra-fine particles between 5 and 6 nm range (Fig. S3). Besides mesoporosity, many macropores were also observed from the STEM images, which were formed due to the polymeric gel structure (Fig. 2). Moreover, no bigger Ni particles were observed in the fresh as-prepared sample. From EDX analysis attached to scanning electron microscope (EDX-SEM), the Ni content of ~ 9.3 wt% was measured (Fig. S4b), which was close to the value determined from the ICP analysis. The elemental mapping shown total overlapping between the Ni, C, and O atoms (Fig. S4), thus, suggesting that the Ni atoms might be chemically bonded with C and/or O atoms. Henceforth, the morphology and elemental analysis results confirmed that the uniform, ultra-fine and immobilized Ni particles were formed over the carbon matrix. The H2-TPR is a useful tool to understand the redox behavior of the catalytic materials. From Fig. 4 represents the reducibility profiles of P@C and Ni@C samples. The TPR profile of Ni@C exhibited two main hydrogen consumption peaks in the measured temperature range. Before 350 °C, there is one peak found in all the samples and it is attributed to the reduction of surface NiO species to metallic nickel. The intensity of this peak is very low due to the co-existence of both phases i.e., NiO and Ni in the fresh Ni@C sample. A very broad and unresolved TPR peak was observed in the temperature region between 400 and 700 °C. This peak could be corresponding to the formation of methane (which can be formed via reaction of surface oxygenated groups anchored to the support with neighboring Ni particles). Further, the decomposition of bulk NiO species to Ni is highly possible at high temperatures (300–700 °C). Fig. 5 represents the STEM images of reduced Ni@C sample, and it is clearly shown that the sample is composed of a large quantity of well-dispersed spherical Ni nanoparticles (around 5.8 ± 1.2 nm) with uniform size and shape. The mean particle size of Ni was also calculated from STEM data by counting more than 400 particles with a standard deviation. The histograms of Ni@C (R) sample confirm a homogeneously and narrow distributed Ni nanoparticles with sizes in the range of 3.7–8.8 nm were narrowly deposited over carbon matrix and few large crystallites were also noticed. From TEM analysis, it clear that the Ni species are well deposited over non-graphitic carbon support in reduced samples. The high-resolution TEM image has shown well-shaped and immobilized Ni nanoparticles that were entirely encapsulated by the carbon matrix. The lattice fringes of d-spacing value of (111) crystallographic plane was estimated to be 0.191 nm (smaller than the literature reported studies) and which is close to metallic Ni phase (0.2034 nm) [29]. Hydrogen chemisorption was analyzed to measure the Ni dispersion, metal surface area and Ni crystallite size and the results were summarized in Table A1 (Supplementary information). The crystallite size calculated from H2 chemisorption was in good agreement with the XRD and TEM results. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed to determine the elemental composition and the chemical state of the reduced Ni@C catalyst using C 1s peak as a standard reference binding energy (B.E.). As shown in Fig. S5, the resulted spectra of the Ni@C (R) sample reveal that the presence of Ni, C, N, and O atoms, respectively. The C1s peaks of the Ni@C (R) samples are located at around 284.6 eV, with a long and sharp peak at higher binding energies. Fig. 6a clearly indicates that the C1s peak was mostly consistent with four moieties that correspond to carbon bonding atoms with different functional groups i.e., the non-oxygenated ring ‘C’, the ‘C’ in CO bonds, the carbonyl bond ‘C’, and the carboxylate carbon bond (OCO) [30]. These different carbon moieties acts as defect sites, which were mainly formed from the sacrificed polymer gel matrix during carbonization. Moreover, these different CO bonds are the important defect sites for anchoring the active Ni nanoparticles. The N 1s spectra can be fitted into 3 corresponding peaks to pyridinic-N (~ 398.4 eV), pyrrolic-N (~ 400.4 eV), and pyridinic N+-O− (~ 405.4 eV) species [31]. The XPS peak of O1s is noticed around at 532.1 eV and this peak is assigned to the oxygen atoms from the organic functional groups of CO, COH/COC, and OO moieties [32]. The Ni2p spectra mainly corresponds to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 core levels around 852.7 and 870.4 eV binding energies, respectively [33]. The Ni 2p3/2 core level showed three peaks at 852.7, 854, and 859.4 eV B.E., assigned to the oxidation state of metallic Ni0, Ni 2+, and Ni 2p3/2 satellite peak, respectively. Moreover, a small portion of Ni oxide peak Ni 2p3/2 was observed at 854.8 eV is due to the partial surface oxidation of Ni during the sample transfer before the XPS measurements. The Ni 2p1/2 core level shows two peaks at 870.4 and 875.4 eV, which corresponds to metallic Ni0 and Ni 2p1/2 satellite peaks. The calculated C, N, O, and Ni contents (wt%) of Ni@C (R) sample are 76.9%, 3.9%, 9.1% and 10.1%, respectively and these values are calculated from the peak area of XPS spectra. The Ni content from XPS, SEM-EDS and ICP analysis results were almost close to the nominal loading."

8,Hydrogenation of furfural,"4.1 Hydrogenation of furfural Hydrogenation of furfural (FA) reaction was performed in a 25 mL stainless steel reactor operated at elevated temperatures between 80 and 140 °C and H2 pressures (2–4 MPa) in different solvents and the activity results were summarized in Table 2. Typically, the hydrogenated furfural products are furfural alcohol (FOL), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFOL), methyl furan and tetrahydromethyl furan. As expected, no activity was observed over the P@C support, thus, indicating that it is inactive FA hydrogenation activity. In the next step, FA hydrogenation reaction over Ni@C was conducted by using different solvents that is methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and H2O. Among them, a better activity and a high THFOL selectivity was achieved in isopropanol (2-PrOH) solvent. In methanol solvent, around 81% FA conversion with 78% FOL and 7% THFOL selectivity was noticed, and it is found that another by product (acetol) was also formed. In ethanol, the conversion of FA is 76%, while the THFOL selectivity was found to be moderate i.e., 66% was due to the formation of furan-2-acrolein (FUA) via aldol condensation of FA. Overall, 2-PrOH was found to be the best solvent to promote highest activity and selectivity compared to ethanol and methanol solvents. Similar results were obtained in Zhang et al. conducted FA hydrogenation in ethanol media using Ni/C catalyst and the by-products FUA and FOL formation was observed [34]. As a comparison, the performance of reference Ni/AC catalyst was also tested and found to be low in hydrogenation activity in terms of FA conversion (61%) and THFOL selectivity (76%) compared to Ni@C catalyst. After conducting series of experimental runs in different operating conditions, finally, we found the most optimized conditions, wherein high activity and selectivity can be achieved (complete FA conversion with ~90% THFOL selectivity was achieved at 120 °C and 3 MPa H2 pressure in 3 h reaction time). Thus, a high conversion and THFOL selectivity was obtained due to the formation of a highly dispersed and ultra-fine small Ni particles over a stabilized carbon supported catalyst. The effect of reaction temperature has been studied in FA hydrogenation in the range of 80–120 °C under similar conditions. As shown in Fig. 7a, the FA conversion is gradually increased and reached complete conversion around 120 °C. Further, the selectivity of THFOL increased with temperature and reached maximum selectivity at 120 °C and thereafter, declined due to the formation of PDO by-product via dehydration of THFOL. The effect of reaction pressure was studied in the range of 2–4 MPa (Fig. 7b) and significantly influenced the reaction. It is evident from Fig. 7b, that 3 MPa is the most optimized pressure, where the highest activity was attained. Even though at 4 MPa, a complete FA conversion was attained but the THFOL selectivity slightly dropped due to PDO formation. The effect of reaction time was also studied, and the results are shown in Fig. 7c. It can be observed that the complete conversion and maximum THFOL selectivity (90%) can be achieved in the first 3 h of reaction time. After prolongation of time, the THFOL selectivity started declining from 90% to 86% due to by-product formation. We were able to determine the most optimal operating conditions from the above results where the highest possible activity and selectivity can be attained, i.e., at 120 °C, 3 MPa and 3 h reaction time. In this work, Ni@C catalyst showed superior performance in tested reaction conditions and the results are compared with the literature data on Ni-based catalysts in Table 3. Most of studies on Ni-based catalysts presented moderately high activity and exhibited notably high THFOL selectivity. The product THFOL selectivity can be altered due to the active phase, chemical state, size, and distribution. However, in Table 3, the key properties for having high activity are mostly dealt with catalyst acidity, oxidation state, dispersion, and synergistic effects of bimetallic phases. Nevertheless, the composition and structural properties of the catalyst are significant in gaining high hydrogenation activity. Moreover, reaction mechanism, by-products formation and reaction conditions can have great influence on the overall performance of the catalyst. Still few drawbacks still exist such as durability, regeneration, and easy preparation. The catalyst stability, regeneration, and reusability of the catalyst is paramount, and in this work, we also tested the durability of the catalyst. This work is another novel approach in designing and developing an inexpensive monodispersed active Ni catalyst embedded in a pyrolyzed carbon support. The spent catalyst after 5 reaction cycles was analysed by TEM (see Supplementary Fig. S6) and found slightly bigger and fewer Ni particles were visible over the support. However, the agglomeration of Ni particles doesn't influence the activity significantly. The recycling of Ni@C catalyst has been studied under optimized operating and reaction conditions. After the first run, the catalyst was centrifuged, and gently washed with ethanol and dried overnight at 80ºC and then reduced before being reused in the next cycle. The recyclability results were displayed in Fig. 7d. Both the conversion of FA and selectivity of THFOL slightly decreased after the fourth recycled. All the results indicated that the Ni@C catalyst was efficient and proven highly stable in the studied reaction cycles."
9,Hydrogenation of levulinic acid,"4.2 Hydrogenation of levulinic acid The catalytic performance of Ni@C and reference Ni/AC catalysts in LA conversion and GVL selectivity were presented in Fig. 8. In LA hydrogenation, the main reaction products and by-products are gamma-valerolactone (GVL), Angelica lactone (AL), valeric acid (VA) and Methyl tetra hydro furan (MTHF). Among both catalysts, the LA conversion over Ni@C was significantly higher than the Ni/AC catalyst. Almost complete conversion of LA and 100% GVL selectivity was achieved. It is evident that, embedded Ni nanoparticles are highly accessible to the reactants and avoid the diffusion limitations over mesoporous carbon matrix. Thus, efficient hydrogen transfer was performed over the Ni particles anchored with carbon defect sites. The effect of different reaction conditions such as reaction temperature, H2 pressure, and reaction time have been studied to gain the insights on the reaction pathway as well as to determine the most optimized conditions. As shown in Fig. 9a, the conversion of LA is gradually increased at elevated temperatures. In particular, up to 200 °C reaction temperature, the GVL selectivity was constant at 100%. Moreover, above 200 °C, the GVL selectivity dropped slightly to 89% due to the by-products formation such as VA and MTHF compounds. The by-product VA was formed via ring opening of GVL and further, MTHF was formed through the hydrogenated product of GVL. The influence of reaction pressure on LA hydrogenation was examined and the results were shown in Fig. 9b. Higher LA conversion can be achieved by increasing the reaction pressure, thus, already a complete LA conversion was achieved at 3 MPa reaction pressure. The effect of reaction time on LA hydrogenation was studied (Fig. 9c). The conversion of LA is clearly improved significantly from 11% to 100% within 4 h time on stream and the selectivity of GVL remains ~ 100% throughout duration. Further, the GVL selectivity decreased to 92.0% prolonging extended reaction time to 5 h. It was assumed that GVL formation took place in the initial time on stream (1–4 h) and then gradually transformed to valeric acid. The recycling of the catalyst was investigated, and the results were displayed in Fig. 9d. Almost similar LA conversion and GVL selectivity were maintained in the different reaction recycles i.e., 1–5 cycles. Thus, the activity of Ni@C was stable over period of different cycles and exhibited highly durable to develop further for a longer stability. The activities of different Ni-based catalysts studied in the LA hydrogenation were compared to that of Ni@C catalyst results of this present work were summarized in Table 4. It is clearly presented a high performance of Ni@C was achieved like those other Ni-based catalysts in similar conditions (Table 4). Overall, the product selectivity and conversion can be influenced by the type of active phase, composition, and solvent type, reaction conditions. The reported studies in Table 4 were mostly active and selective catalysts with different catalyst compositions and conditions. In this work, we reached similar and somewhat better activity results with novel and simple approach in preparing inexpensive Ni@C catalyst. Henceforth, the Ni@C catalyst is highly durable and stable over the time of stream and can be successively reused for many reaction cycles without deactivation. In order to get a better insight into the present work, we made a comparison with the published data. We summarized the most active Ni-based catalysts reported in the literature and were presented in Table 4. The apparent activation energies (Ea) for both reactions i.e., FA and LA hydrogenation was calculated from the Arrhenius plots was presented in Fig. 10. The activation energies for FA hydrogenation to THFOL and LA hydrogenation to GVL were 15.4 kJ mol−1 and 33.6 kJ mol−1, respectively. The activation energies were not found with most of the studies reported in the scientific literature. However, a comprehensive experimental work was carried out in this work to show the Ea which is relatively low. The Ea values are quite lower compared to the reported studies and thus, Ni@C catalyst efficiently lowers the energy barrier."
10,Conclusions,"Transformation of biomass-based platform molecules was studied over a facile synthesized Ni nanoparticles encapsulated in a carbonized polymer-gel. The Ni nanoparticles embedded into the mesoporous carbon support derived from the sacrificial agent organic copolymer were prepared. The mesoporous carbon support provided different defect sites for anchoring Ni particles and strong interactions between carbon-Ni phase were observed. Finally, a highly dispersed and stabilized Ni nanoparticles were embedded into a pyrolyzed nano-structured carbon gel was obtained. The micrograph images, and diffraction patterns concluded that the ultra-fine nanosized Ni particles intact with the solidified carbon matrix. Valorization of platform molecules i.e., furfural and levulinic acid by one-step hydrogenation was studied successfully over Ni@C catalyst. The Ni@C exhibited superior activity and desired structural properties which are found to be acitve and selective in the hydrogenation of furfural and levulinic acid. The products THFOL and GVL were selectively produced in one-step process via catalytic hydrogenation of FA & LA. The operating and reaction conditions had significant effect on the reaction and catalyst performance. Overall, it is promising to develop further the cost-effective Ni@C catalyst to gain long lasting durability and stability for the biomass-platform molecules transformation for the future biorefinery."
