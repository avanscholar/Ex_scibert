0,Introduction,"Furfuryl alcohol (FOL) is a very important intermediate in the chemical industry since it is widely used in the production of: (1) thermostatic resins with high chemical resistance to acids, bases and certain solvents; (2) liquid resins for galvanic bath; (3) synthetic fibers; (4) farm chemicals; (5) foundry binders; (6) adhesives for plywood and furniture; (7) other fine chemical products such as vitamin C and lysine [1–4]. FOL is mainly produced by furfural (FAL) hydrogenation either in gas or liquid phase. Gas-phase hydrogenation of FAL has mainly two disadvantages: higher amount of byproducts than those produced in the liquid-phase process and higher energy consumption due to the necessity of vaporizing FAL [5]. Instead, solvent and high H2 pressures are required in liquid-phase FAL hydrogenation but generally high selectivity to FOL are reached [4,6]. It is well known that copper chromite (Cu-Cr) catalysts have been the most successful commercial catalysts for over five decades in FAL hydrogenation processes. Selectivities to FOL of 98% in liquid-phase and between 35 and 98% in gas-phase are achieved with this Cu-Cr catalyst in different industrial processes [4]. However, the main drawback of the Cu-Cr catalysts is their high toxicity that causes severe environmental pollution after catalyst final disposal [7]. Even more, though these catalysts are very selective to FOL, they showed a moderate activity for FAL hydrogenation [8]. Based on the previously said, it is a great challenge to design environmentally friendly, active and selective catalysts for the liquid-phase FAL hydrogenation to FOL. Fig. 1 shows the most likely reaction pathways for FAL conversion over metal catalysts in the presence of H2. Initially, three different reactions are possible: the selective hydrogenation of the carbonyl group of FAL to give FOL that is the desired reaction, the reduction of the CC bonds to give tetrahydrofurfural (THFAL) and the decarbonylation of FAL to produce furan (FAN). These three primary products are then converted in several other compounds by different hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions. For instance, THFAL and FOL can be converted by hydrogenation into tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFOL), which is also a product of industrial importance. Other possible reaction products could be 2-methylfuran (MFAN), 2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran (THMF), 2-pentanol (PNOL), 1,5-pentanodiol (PDOL), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 1-butanol (BNOL), as it is shown in Fig. 1. However, among all the products in this complex reaction network, FOL is the most interesting and valuable one for the chemical industry, therefore important efforts are made in order to achieve high FOL selectivity. The liquid-phase FAL hydrogenation has been studied using catalysts based on Ni [2,9,10], Co [6] and Pt [1,11] and in some cases a second metal or a promoter was added to improve the activity and/or selectivity. Little information is available in the literature about the use of Cu-based catalysts containing no Cr for the FAL hydrogenation. Xu et al. studied the effect of the activation temperature on the performance of Cu-Ni-Mg-Al catalysts, obtaining FOL selectivities between 80 and 85% at 473K and 10bar using ethanol as solvent [3]. In previous studies, our research group has shown that Cu-based catalysts are efficient for the liquid-phase hydrogenation of different unsaturated carbonyl compounds to the corresponding unsaturated alcohol [12–14]. Therefore, it seems reasonable to study the liquid-phase hydrogenation of FAL over Cu-based catalysts without Cr to compare their performance with that one of a Cu-Cr sample. In this paper, we studied the liquid-phase FAL hydrogenation over different Cu-based catalysts free of Cr and the results were compared with those obtained with a Cu-Cr catalyst. Experimental data were obtained by varying FAL concentration and reaction temperature. The goal of this work is to determine the feasibility of replacing polluting Cu-Cr catalysts by eco-compatible catalytic systems for the selective liquid-phase FAL hydrogenation."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation A Cu/SiO2 catalyst (Cu/SiO2-I) was prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method. Copper was deposited on commercial silica (Sigma–Aldrich grade 62, 99.7%) by adding dropwise a 0.6M aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (Merck, 98%). The solid was dried in an oven at 373K for 12h and then decomposed in N2 flow at 673K for 5h. Another Cu/SiO2 catalyst (Cu/SiO2-PD) was prepared by the precipitation–deposition method, adding simultaneously an aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and an aqueous solution of K2CO3 at pH 7.2±0.2 in an aqueous SiO2 suspension at 333K. After aging for 1h at 333K, the solid was separated by filtration, washed with deionized water at 333K and dried at 353K overnight. The hydrated precursor was then decomposed in N2 flow at 673K for 5h to obtain the corresponding oxide precursor. CuZnAl, CuMgAl and Cu-Cr catalysts were prepared by the co-precipitation method. An acidic solution containing the metal nitrates and an aqueous K2CO3 solution were simultaneously added dropwise to 400mL of distilled water at 333K, while keeping the pH at 7.2±0.2 for CuZnAl and Cu-Cr or 10±0.2 for CuMgAl, according to the procedures described elsewhere [15–17]. The resulting precipitates were aged for 1h at 333K and then filtered, washed with deionized water at 333K and dried at 353K overnight. The hydrated precursors were decomposed in N2 flow at 773K for 5h to obtain the corresponding mixed oxides. The atomic ratios in CuZnAl and CuMgAl were (Cu+M)/Al=1 and M/Al=0.75, where M=Mg, Zn. In the case of Cu-Cr sample, the Cu/Cr ratio was equal to 20."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The identification of polycrystalline species formed after decomposition in N2 flow was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Shimadzu XD-1 diffractometer and Ni-filtered Cu-Kα radiation with a scan speed of 2̊min−1. The crystallite sizes were estimated by applying Debye-Scherrer equation. Specific surface areas (Sg) were measured by N2 physisorption at 77K in a Quantochrome Autosorb I sorptometer. Elemental composition of the samples was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). The relative reducibility of the calcined metal samples was determined by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) using a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920V 2.00 equipment with a TCD detector. TPR profiles were obtained with a H2(5%)/Ar gaseous mixture at 60mL (STP)min−1 through a fixed bed containing 100mg of sample, while heating from 298 to 973K at 10K/min. The metal dispersion of the Cu catalysts was measured by titration with N2O at 363K using a stoichiometry of (Cu0)s/N2O=2, where (Cu0)s is a Cu0 atom on surface [18,19]. Pre-reduced samples were exposed to pulses of N2O(10%)/Ar. The number of chemisorbed oxygen atoms was calculated from the consumption of N2O measured by mass spectrometry (MS) in a Baltzers Omnistar unit. Hydrogen chemisorption was measured via volumetric adsorption experiments at room temperature in a conventional vacuum apparatus using a method described elsewhere [14]."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests The liquid-phase hydrogenation of FAL (Aldrich, 99%) was carried out in a 100mL autoclave (Parr 4565), equipped with mechanical stirrer, in the range of 363–383K and using 2-propanol (Merck, 99%) as solvent. The autoclave was loaded with 60mL of solvent and about 0.1g of catalyst. Prior to catalytic tests, samples were activated ex situ in H2 flow (30mLmin−1) at 623K for 1.5h and then transferred to the reactor, avoiding contact with air, under inert atmosphere (N2). The reaction system was stirred and heated up to reaction temperature at 2K/min. Then, 0.25–1.00mL of FAL was injected into the reactor and the total pressure was rapidly increased up to 10bar with H2. The batch reactor was assumed to be perfectly mixed. A stirring speed higher than 600rpm and catalyst particles smaller than 100μm in size were used to ensure the kinetic control of the reaction; i.e., diffusional limitations were negligible [13]. The absence of gas/liquid, liquid/solid and intraparticle mass transfer limitations was verified using the quantitative criteria described by Ramachandran and Chaudhari [20]. This criterion has been widely employed for liquid-phase hydrogenation reactions with successful results [21,22]. Concentrations of FAL and products were followed during the reaction by ex situ gas chromatography using an Agilent 6850 chromatograph equipped with flame ionization detector and a 30m HP-Innowax capillary column with a 0.25mm coating. Liquid samples were withdrawn from the reactor and collected every 15–30min by using a loop under pressure in order to avoid flushing. Reactant conversion (X FAL, mol of FAL reacted/mol of FAL fed) was calculated as X FAL =(C 0 FAL − C FAL)/C 0 FAL, where C 0 FAL is the initial FAL concentration and C FAL is the FAL concentration at time t. Selectivities toward product i (S i , mol of product i/mol of converted reactant) were calculated as S i = C i /∑C j , where ∑C j is the total concentration of products. The C j values were calculated using n-dodecane (Sigma–Aldrich, >99%) as internal standard."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The results obtained from the characterization of samples used in this work are summarized in Table 1 . The Cu loading for the catalysts without Cr, determined by AAS, was between 11 and 18wt%, while for the Cu-Cr sample was 43.7wt%. This is a Cu loading three to four times higher than for the Cr-free samples and similar to the Cu loading of commercial Cu-Cr catalysts. Thus, metal loading followed the trend: Cu-Cr>CuMgAl>CuZnAl≅Cu/SiO2-I≅Cu/SiO2-PD. The X-ray diffractograms of the precursors after decomposition in N2 are shown in Fig. 2 . Cu/SiO2-I sample contains a single polycrystalline phase with a tenorite-like structure (CuO, JCPDS 5-0661), obtained by decomposition of Cu(NO3)2 (JCPDS 14-415), with a mean crystallite size of about 30nm. No X-ray diffraction signals were observed in the case of Cu/SiO2-PD oxide precursor, suggesting that the CuO phase is quasi-amorphous (q.a.) and/or formed by small crystalline domains that are not detectable by XRD (Table 1, Fig. 2). In the case of the samples prepared by co-precipitation, the only polycrystalline phase detected by XRD after decomposition in N2 was a spinel-like phase (ZnAl2O4, JCPDS 5-0669 and MgAl2O4, JCPDS 21-1152), which was obtained by pseudomorphic decomposition of a hydrotalcite-like phase (JCPDS 14-191) formed during co-precipitation [23]. For both cases, the spinel-like phase showed a low crystallinity degree and small mean crystallite size of about 5nm. No segregation of CuO, ZnO or MgO crystalline phases were detected in the CuZnAl and CuMgAl mixed oxides after decomposition, thereby indicating that the cations are highly dispersed in the spinel-like matrix. Finally, the only polycrystalline phase detected for the Cu-Cr sample was CuCr2O4, which also has a spinel-like structure (JCPDS 5-0657). The specific surface areas (Sg) of the oxide precursors without Cr were between 170 and 291m2 g−1 (Table 1). In particular, the silica-supported samples Cu/SiO2-I and Cu/SiO2-PD showed specific surface areas slightly lower than the one corresponding to the SiO2 support (230m2 g−1). The Cr-free mixed oxides with spinel-like structure showed specific surface areas of 171m2 g−1 for CuZnAl and 291m2 g−1 for CuMgAl. In contrast, the specific surface area of the Cu-Cr oxide precursor was about only a quarter of those values determined for the silica-supported samples. In summary, the specific surface area trend was: CuMgAl>Cu/SiO2-PD≅Cu/SiO2-I>CuZnAl≫Cu-Cr. The results corresponding to the reducibility of the samples after decomposition in N2 are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1. The TPR profile for the Cu/SiO2-I oxide precursor exhibited only a broad peak between 573 and 663K, with the maximum at 613K, arising from the reduction of the tenorite-like phase [Fig. 3, profile (a)]. This broad peak is indicating the reduction of CuO particles with a wide size distribution, as it has been previously suggested [15]. The TPR experiment with Cu/SiO2-PD sample [Fig. 3, profile (b)] showed a reduction profile shifted to lower temperatures, between 523 and 603K, with the maximum at 569K and a shoulder at 583K. This TPR profile is suggesting a broad size distribution of CuO particles rather different to that of Cu/SiO2-I [24]. It is also possible that Cu2+ ions on Cu/SiO2-PD are interacting in dissimilar grade with silica support surface. As a consequence, Cu2+ ions with varying reducibility will be present on the support surface. In any case, an asymmetric TPR profile, as the one shown in Fig. 3(b), will be obtained. Assuming a core-shell model for the reduction, it is likely that the CuO particles of Cu/SiO2-PD are much smaller than those of Cu/SiO2-I, in agreement with XRD results. This is explaining the lower reduction temperature in the case of Cu/SiO2-PD [Fig. 3, profiles (b) and (a)]. The TPR profile of CuZnAl mixed oxide showed a single and broad reduction peak between 483 and 623K with the maximum at 575K [Fig. 3, profile (c)]. This reduction peak is suggesting an important Cu-support interaction and a size distribution similar to the case of Cu/SiO2-PD sample. CuMgAl, the other Cr-free mixed oxide prepared by the co-precipitation method, showed also a single reduction peak but at lower temperatures than CuZnAl, more specifically between 463 and 553K, with the maximum at 519K [Fig. 3, profile (d)]. This is indicating a Cu2+-support interaction and/or a size distribution of CuO particles some different to those ones in CuZnAl and Cu/SiO2-PD. No evidence of CuAl2O4 reduction was detected in CuZnAl and CuMgAl samples, which is consistent with XRD characterization results. Finally, the Cu-Cr sample exhibited a large and very broad reduction peak between 453 and 563K, showing the maximum at 520K [Fig. 3, profile (e)]. In summary, the pattern for the reducibility of the oxide samples was: CuMgAl≅Cu-Cr>CuZnAl≅Cu/SiO2-PD>Cu/SiO2-I. Assuming a CuO/H2 =1 stoichiometric, Cu loads determined by AAS were verified with the total H2 consumption estimated from the TPR profiles. In addition, after reduction at 623K in a H2(100%) flow for 1.5h, it was verified that there was no further H2 consumption. This result is indicating complete reduction of Cu2+ ions to Cu0 in all of the samples. The capacity for irreversible H2 chemisorption, on the basis of the exposed metal surface, followed the pattern: CuMgAl>CuZnAl>Cu-Cr≅Cu/SiO2-I>Cu/SiO2-PD. It is worth noticing that the values determined for Cu-Cr, CuZnAl, Cu/SiO2-PD and Cu/SiO2-I were about half of that one for CuMgAl (Table 1). This is indicating that the CuMgAl sample, with the highest Cu2+ reducibility of the Cr-free series, has also the highest capacity for the dissociative H2 chemisorption. Regarding the copper dispersion, the results of the titration with N2O at 363K are presented in Table 1. Samples Cu/SiO2-PD and CuZnAl showed dispersion values (21–23%) twice higher than that for CuMgAl sample (11%) and one order of magnitude higher than those for Cu/SiO2-I and Cu-Cr (2–3%). Therefore, the metallic dispersion pattern was: CuZnAl≅Cu/SiO2-PD>CuMgAl>Cu-Cr≅Cu/SiO2-I. In the case of Cu/SiO2-I and Cu/SiO2-PD it was possible to estimate the average particle size assuming cubic metal particles and using a surface density of Cu atoms of 1.08×1015 atcm−2. The estimated values for the Cu metal particle size were 32nm for Cu/SiO2-I and 3.3nm for Cu/SiO2-PD. This is in agreement with XRD and TPR results (Figs. 2 and 3) and it is indicating that small metal copper particles are formed by reduction of the highly dispersed CuO phase on Cu/SiO2-PD. In contrast, large metal particles are obtained from the reduction of a poorly dispersed CuO phase in Cu/SiO2-I."
7,Catalytic tests,"3.2 Catalytic tests 3.2.1 Screening of Cu-based catalysts FAL conversion evolutions, in function of the parameters (WCu.t/n0 FAL) and (Cuexp.t/m0 FAL), are shown in Fig. 4 . The initial FAL conversion rates (r0 FAL, molg−1 Cu min−1) and turnover frequencies (TOF, min−1) were estimated by applying polynomial differentiation at zero time to these curves in Fig. 4(a) and (b), respectively. These r0 FAL and TOF values are presented in Table 2 . The pattern for the initial hydrogenation rate (r0 FAL) was: CuMgAl>Cu/SiO2-PD>CuZnAl>Cu-Cr >> Cu/SiO2-I (Fig. 4(a) and Table 2); i.e. three of the Cr-free catalysts were initially more active than Cu-Cr sample. However, taking into account the differences in Cu dispersion and loading among the samples, it becomes necessary to estimate TOF values in order to compare the intrinsic activity of the Cu metal sites. Considering the TOF values, the activity pattern was: CuMgAl>Cu-Cr>Cu/SiO2-PD≅CuZnAl>Cu/SiO2-I (Fig. 4(b) and Table 2). It is worth noticing that TOF for CuMgAl catalyst was twice of that for Cu-Cr and about one order of magnitude higher than those for CuZnAl and Cu/SiO2 catalysts. This pattern is in agreement with the one determined from FAL conversions after 4h of reaction, also shown in Table 2. In addition, when the initial FAL concentration was increased twice, the FAL conversion at 4h of reaction clearly diminished for all the catalysts. This is suggesting that the FAL concentration has a negative effect on the reaction kinetic; i.e. the reaction order respect to FAL could be negative, reflecting a strong interaction between reactant and Cu metal surface. It is worth to notice that for CuZnAl and CuMgAl the conversion at 4h diminished only 30–35% with the increase of the initial FAL concentration. Instead, the conversion decay was 50% for Cu-Cr, 70% with Cu/SiO2-PD and 80% for Cu/SiO2-I considering the same increase in the initial FAL concentration (Table 2). The above results indicate that CuMgAl, with the highest H2 chemisorption capacity, was the most active catalyst. However, considering all the samples, there is not a linear relationship between the activity pattern and H2 chemisorption capacity or metal dispersion (Tables 1 and 2). This could indicate that the initial activity for FAL hydrogenation is also depending on the particular interaction between FAL and Cu metal surface in each case. In this sense, it is likely that metal active sites can chemisorb FAL strongly, partially poisoning the catalytic surface. This is in agreement with the decrease of the FAL hydrogenation rate as the initial FAL concentration increases (Table 2). This decrease in activity follows the pattern: Cu/SiO2-I>Cu/SiO2-PD>Cu-Cr>CuMgAl≅CuZnAl (Table 2). Thus, activity of samples with a spinel-like structure is less influenced by the increase in FAL concentration than activity of samples in which Cu is supported on SiO2. In summary, the initial activity and the decay in activity with the increase of reactant concentration are strongly influenced by different factors as H2 chemisorption capacity, metal copper dispersion, catalyst structure and metal-support interaction. A higher dispersion of metal copper phase was attained on Cu/SiO2-PD than on Cu/SiO2-I. Thus, linear adsorption of FAL and dissociative chemisorption of hydrogen are more favored on Cu/SiO2-PD than on Cu/SiO2-I. This can explain the higher hydrogenation activity and the lower activity decay of Cu/SiO2-PD respect to Cu/SiO2-I. In the case of CuZnAl and CuMgAl, the high interaction of small metal copper particles with a spinel-like phase can modify the metal electronic density and/or the crystallographic planes exposed on the metal particle surface. In any case, the effect of this interaction on the copper catalytic activity is more important for CuMgAl than for CuZnAl. In other words, the nature of cations in the spinel plays a very important role. In this sense, Mg2+ ions seem to favor the formation of a catalytic surface more active for FAL chemisorption and the subsequent hydrogenation than Zn2+ ions. On the other hand, additional centers for on-top FAL adsorption can be available on the spinel-like surface [15]. Thus, FAL can be chemisorbed and activated on both small metal copper clusters and cations present on the surface of a non-stoichiometric spinel-like matrix. This increases the probability for FAL hydrogenation and decreases the deactivation effect by strong FAL adsorption on metal copper sites. Regarding the product distribution, it is worth noticing that selectivity to FOL was 100% in all of the cases during the complete catalytic runs. This is quite remarkable, taking into account the wide variety of products that can be formed from the interaction of FAL, H2 and a metal catalyst, as it was shown in Fig. 1. In this sense, compared with other metal-based catalysts, Cu catalysts achieved total FOL selectivity without adding any other metal or promoter. In summary, all the Cu-based catalysts used in this work were totally selective to FOL. However, CuMgAl was the most active catalyst of this series, which was attributed to a strong and intimate interaction between small metal copper particles and Mg2+ ions on the surface of a non-stoichiometric spinel-like matrix. Then, this catalyst was selected to study the influence of the operative conditions on the catalytic activity. 3.2.2 Influence of reaction conditions The effect of initial FAL concentration and temperature on the activity of CuMgAl catalyst, at constant H2 pressure, was studied in this part. For this study, the initial FAL hydrogenation rate (r* 0 FAL) was expressed by g of catalyst (molg−1 min−1) and a pseudo-homogeneous kinetic model based on a power-law rate equation was proposed (Eq. (1)). (1) r FAL * 0 = k ⋅ ( p H 2 ) α ⋅ ( C FAL 0 ) β = k ’ ⋅ ( C FAL 0 ) β The effect of FAL initial concentration on catalytic activity was studied at 383K and 10bar. The initial concentration of FAL (C 0 FAL) was varied between 9.9×10−2 and 1.5×10−1 M. The results, presented in Fig. 5(a) and Table 3 , show that the initial catalytic activity decreases by increasing the initial FAL concentration, in agreement with the results previously obtained during the catalyst screening. The reaction order with respect to FAL was determined by calculating β from these data applying both linear and non-linear regression with Eq. (1). The value estimated for β was equal to −0.98; i.e. a negative and almost unitary reaction order. A similar study performed with Cu-Cr catalyst at the same conditions gave a value for β approximately equal to −0.8 (not shown in this work). These results confirm that FAL interacts strongly with the Cu metal surface under the conditions used in this work. The influence of temperature on catalytic activity was investigated between 363 and 383K, at p =10bar and C 0 FAL =9.9×10−2 M. Taking into account that FAL is strongly adsorbed on metal copper surface and that the rate constant increases and the FAL adsorption constant diminishes with temperature, it is expected that the temperature will have an important impact on the FAL hydrogenation rate. The magnitude of the increase of the initial FAL hydrogenation rate with temperature is shown in Fig. 5(b) and Table 3. An estimate of 127kJmol−1 for the apparent activation energy (E A) was determined by numerical regression assuming valid Arrhenius law. To our knowledge, there are not many reported values for the activation energy of the liquid-phase FAL hydrogenation. Vaidya and Mahajani, using a Pt/C catalyst and 2-propanol as solvent, reported a value equal to 28kJmol−1, which is a surprisingly low value considering that the absence of diffusional resistances was verified [1]. Rojas et al. reported an E A =37.7kJmol−1 for FAL hydrogenation over Ir/Nb2O5 catalyst [25]. In this sense, the values obtained for E A over noble metal-based catalysts, which are very active for this reaction, are much lower than the EA observed with CuMgAl catalyst. It is likely that the high E A estimated in this work is due to very strong adsorption of FAL on metal copper surface, as it was mentioned above. Then, temperature simultaneously increases the rate constant and diminishes the strong FAL adsorption over Cu0 metal sites. Regarding the catalyst selectivity, in all the catalytic runs the FOL selectivity was always equal to 100%, which shows that the CuMgAl catalyst is totally selective for hydrogenating FAL to FOL in this range of experimental conditions. In summary, the negative order respect to FAL and the high apparent activation energy obtained in the liquid phase hydrogenation of FAL over CuMgAl are confirming the very strong interaction between reactant molecules and metal copper surface."
8,Conclusions,"We have shown that Cu-based catalysts free of Cr are active for the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural with 100% selectivity to furfuryl alcohol. In particular, a CuMgAl catalyst, prepared by the coprecipitation method, was more active for this reaction than a copper chromite traditional catalyst. This could be a very important progress for the industrial production of furfuryl alcohol since, for many decades, the copper chromite catalysts were the most active and selective for this reaction. A solid catalyst formed by small copper particles is more active and stable in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural than when it is mainly constituted by large metal copper particles. This is clearly concluded from the comparison of Cu/SiO2 catalysts prepared by precipitation–deposition and impregnation methods. However, metal-support interaction can also play a very important role in modifying the activity of metal copper. Thus, the catalytic performance is greatly improved if small copper particles are in intimate interaction with a Mg-Al spinel-like matrix. It was also determined that it is desirable to work at high temperature in order to reach high furfural conversion rates and to reduce deactivation due to strong furfural adsorption. Selectivity to furfuryl alcohol is not influenced neither by initial furfural concentration nor temperature in this range of operative conditions, being always equal to 100%."
