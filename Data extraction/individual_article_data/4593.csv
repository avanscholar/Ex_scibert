0,Experimental procedures,
1,Materials and methods,"1.1 Materials and methods All of the reagents used for catalyst synthesis and characterization were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a FT-IR spectrometer (NEXUS-6700, Nicolet, USA). The Xe lamp (XD350W-1, Changzhou Siyu Environmental Sci-Tech Co., Ltd., China) was used as the light source to perform the photocatalytic experiment. The morphologies of magnetic nanoparticles were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G220s-Twin, FEI, USA). Diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were measured using an ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectrophotometer (UV-2600, Shimazu, Japan). Analysis of the oxidation products of benzyl alcohol was carried out by a high-performance liquid chromatography system (Ultimate 3000, Dionex, USA). The radical was measured by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, which was carried out on a Bruker EMX spectrometer (EPR-A200, Bruker, Switzerland) with a Quanta-Ray Nd:YAG laser."
2,Synthesis of cobalt octakis(butylthio) porphyrazine,"1.2 Synthesis of cobalt octakis(butylthio) porphyrazine Firstly, magnesium chips (0.056g) and iodine crystals as an initiator were added into n-butanol (100mL). The mixture was stirred under reflux for 24hr until the magnesium chips disappeared, indicating that magnesium butoxide had successfully formed. Then 2,3-bis(butylthio)maleonitrile (Zhou et al., 2016) (2g, 0.0078mol) was added to the above mixture, which was heated under reflux for 24hr. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and then dried by rotary evaporation. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using ethyl acetate/petroleum ether as eluent (1:5, V/V), giving MgPz(S-Bu)8 (1.49g, yield 73.5%). MgPz(S-Bu)8 (1.041g) was added to CF3COOH (3mL) in the dark and stirred for 5hr. The resulting purple solution was added to ice-water to promote precipitation. The precipitate was filtered, then washed with water until the filtrate was colorless, and dried under vacuum. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using dichloroethane/petroleum ether as eluent (1:1, V/V), giving H2Pz(S-Bu)8 (0.666g, yield 65.4%). CoPz(S-Bu)8 was synthesized by the reaction of Co(OAc)2·4H2O with a certain amount of H2Pz(S-Bu)8 in 40mL dimethylformamide (DMF) for 12hr at 70°C under nitrogen atmosphere. After reaction, the mixture was added to ice-water (200mL) and stirred until precipitation was complete. After cooling to room temperature, the precipitate consisting of the crude product and excess metal salts was filtered and then washed with water until the filtrate was colorless. The residue was dried under vacuum and then purified by column chromatography on silica gel using dichloromethane/methanol as eluent (10:1, V/V), giving the final product with a yield of 73.5%. For the characterization of H2Pz(S-Bu)8 and CoPz(S-Bu)8, see (Zhou et al., 2016)."
3,Preparation of composite catalyst CoPz(S-Bu)8/SiO2@Fe3O4,"1.3 Preparation of composite catalyst CoPz(S-Bu)8/SiO2@Fe3O4 Magnetite Fe3O4 nano-spheres were prepared by a one-pot hydrothermal method (Zhang et al., 2013b). Typically, 10g FeCl3·6H2O and 3.6g trisodium citrate dihydrate were first dissolved in 300mL ethylene glycol under vigorous stirring for 1hr. Then 15g sodium acetate was added with stirring for 30min, and the mixture was sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 200°C for 10hr. After that, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature. The as-prepared black product was thoroughly washed with deionized water and ethanol several times, and finally dried at 60°C for 6hr. The as-synthesized Fe3O4 was suspended in 35mL ethanol and 6mL deionized water and sonicated for 15min. 1.5mL of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was added slowly to the mixture, which was then sonicated for 10min. Aqueous ammonia (10%, 1.4mL) was then added slowly over 10min under mechanical stirring. The mixture was heated at 40°C for 12hr. The iron oxide nanoparticles with a thin layer of silica (SiO2@Fe3O4) were separated by an external magnet, washed three times with ethanol, and then dried under vacuum (Rezaeifard et al., 2012). CoPz(S-Bu)8 (40mg) was firstly dissolved in 20mL dichloromethane under ultrasonic action. Then the solution was added dropwise into a suspension containing 1g SiO2@Fe3O4 and 20mL dichloromethane under stirring. The stirring was continued for 24hr until adsorption equilibrium to obtain magnetic nanoparticles loaded with cobalt porphyrazine. After reaction, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to give a solid residue. The residue was dried at 40°C for 24hr. Thus the magnetic nanoparticle-supported CoPz(S-Bu)8 was formed. The loading of CoPz(S-Bu)8 on the magnetic nanoparticles was verified by FT-IR and DRS before and after CoPz(S-Bu)8 loading on the magnetic nanoparticles, and the loading content of CoPz(S-Bu)8 was equal to 4.0%."
4,Photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols,"1.4 Photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols The catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol was carried out in a 50-mL quartz reaction flask equipped with a reflux condenser. In a typical photocatalytic reaction, benzyl alcohol (0.10mmol) and the as-prepared composite catalyst (0.02g) were placed into the flask containing 25mL H2O, then the reaction mixture was continuously stirred at room temperature. H2O2 (0.3mmol, 30%) was then added dropwise slowly into the reaction flask within 5min and the reaction was continued for 12hr. During the reaction, 0.5mL of the sample was withdrawn periodically from the mixture and filtered to remove the catalyst, then the percentage conversion was determined by analysis with a high-performance liquid chromatography system equipped with a reversed-phase C18 column (00G-4252-E0, Phenomenex, USA) and detection at 250nm. The column temperature was maintained at 30°C. The optimized mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and water with the volume ratio at 70:30. The flow rate was set at 1.0mL/min. The oxidation products benzaldehyde and benzoic acid were identified by comparison with known standard samples, which were purchased from Aladdin. When the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols was carried out under alkaline conditions such as with addition of KOH or K2CO3, benzoic acid was in the form of the corresponding benzoic acid potassium salt. Potassium benzoate is soluble in water and could also be analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography, the quantity of potassium benzoate was consistent with the yield of benzoic acid, therefore the benzoic acid product of benzyl alcohol oxidation under alkaline conditions could be accurately quantified. All experimental data was repeated three times and the average was taken to eliminate any discrepancies."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Preparation of composite catalyst CoPz(S-Bu)8/SiO2@Fe3O4,"2.1 Preparation of composite catalyst CoPz(S-Bu)8/SiO2@Fe3O4 The starting point for the synthesis of CoPz(S-Bu)8 was the precursor 2,3-bis(butylthio)maleonitrile, which was obtained from the reaction of disodium dithiomaleonitrile salt with n-bromobutane. Thereafter the metal-free octkis(butylthio) porphyrazine (H2Pz(S-Bu)8) was obtained in a yield of 72.3% via the template reaction of the precursor with magnesium butoxide. Coordination of Co2+ into the center of the porphyrazine ring was carried out by the reaction of Co(OAc)2 with H2Pz(S-Bu)8 at the reflux temperature of DMF, giving rise to CoPz(S-Bu)8 with a yield of 86.7%. The solubility of all metallothioporphyrazines is poor. To enhance the solubility and facilitate purification, the peripheries of the porphyrazine macrocycle were grafted with long chain butylthio groups. However, the as-synthesized CoPz(S-Bu)8 was still insoluble in aqueous solution. It is necessary to support the CoPz(S-Bu)8 on the carrier SiO2@Fe3O4 so as to form a suspension in aqueous solution to react with substrates, using its lipophilicity. Moreover, because Fe3O4 particles encounter problems with surface acid etching and self-aggregation, the outside of Fe3O4 was coated with SiO2. At the same time, the SiO2 coating was able to stabilize the porphyrazine macrocycle, thus Fe3O4 with a SiO2 shell was chosen as the carrier for the as-synthesized CoPz(S-Bu)8. Magnetite Fe3O4 nano-spheres prepared by a one-pot hydrothermal method (Zhang et al., 2013b) obviously differ from those prepared by a coprecipitation method (Wang et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2017), in which the Fe3O4 nano-particles have an amorphous and non-uniform morphology. The TEM image of the SiO2@Fe3O4 with a typical core-shell structure is presented in Fig. 1 . The black sphere is the core Fe3O4 particle and the SiO2 coating is about 10–20nm thick with a gray appearance. The SiO2@Fe3O4 core–shell structure has a diameter range of about 200–400nm. The FT-IR spectra of SiO2@Fe3O4, CoPz(S-Bu)8 and CoPz(S-Bu)8/SiO2@Fe3O4 are shown in Fig. 2 . Typically, the vibration peak near 1084cm−1 can be assigned to the asymmetric stretching vibration of the siloxane bond SiOSi associated with the condensed silica network. The C-H stretching vibration can be observed in both CoPz(S-Bu)8 and CoPz(S-Bu)8/SiO2@Fe3O4 at 2928cm−1. The DRS of SiO2@Fe3O4 and CoPz(S-Bu)8/SiO2@Fe3O4 are shown in Fig. 3 . The composite CoPz(S-Bu)8/SiO2@Fe3O4 showed the characteristic Q-band absorption of CoPz(S-Bu)8 near 670nm and B-band absorption near 355nm respectively. There was no discernable characteristic absorption peak for the carrier SiO2@Fe3O4. The results of FT-IR and DRS characterization demonstrated that the CoPz(S-Bu)8 was loaded on SiO2@Fe3O4 successfully."
7,Oxidation of benzyl alcohol catalyzed by CoPz(S-Bu)8/SiO2@Fe3O4,"2.2 Oxidation of benzyl alcohol catalyzed by CoPz(S-Bu)8/SiO2@Fe3O4 To assess the activity of the as-prepared composite catalyst CoPz(S-Bu)8/SiO2@Fe3O4, the oxidation of benzyl alcohol was carried out using the green oxidant H2O2 and the CoPz(S-Bu)8/SiO2@Fe3O4 catalyst suspended in aqueous solution under irradiation by a Xe lamp simulating sunlight. As we all know, activating H2O2 can produce HO and O2 − , therefore the photocatalytic oxidation is a radical reaction, which may non-selectively oxidize benzyl alcohol into different products, even CO2 (Su et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2017). In this respect, the biomimetic catalyst displayed a unique advantage: the products of photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol only included benzaldehyde and benzoic acid. The influence of various reaction parameters on the conversion rate of benzyl alcohol (BAL) and selectivity of benzoic acid (BZA) was investigated in detail. Table 1 lists the effect of reaction time on the conversion and selectivity from entry 1 to entry 4. The conversion increased with prolonged reaction time, but the conversion increments became smaller and smaller. Thus 12hr was chosen as the optimal reaction time. Comparing entry 4 with entry 5, the conversion increased to 21.2% as the concentration of H2O2 increased (with mole ratio of H2O2 to benzyl alcohol ranging from 2:1 to 3:1). Meanwhile, from entry 5 to entry 8, the conversion presented a maximum of 36.4% as the illumination intensity (I (W/cm2)) increased from 0.40 to 0.45. This indicated that 0.42W/cm2 is the optimal illumination intensity and a three-fold molar ratio of H2O2 relative to benzyl alcohol is the optimal quantity taking into account cost considerations, while also not reducing the selectivity for benzoic acid. From entry 7 and entries 11 to 16, it could be seen that the reaction temperature had an obvious influence on the conversion and selectivity, although the reaction was a light-induced radical reaction. This indicated that room temperature was the optimal temperature. From entry 9, the conversion of benzyl alcohol in the presence of bare SiO2@Fe3O4 was 20.0%, and when the composite CoPz(S-Bu)8/SiO2@Fe3O4 replaced the bare SiO2@Fe3O4 (entry 7), the conversion increased to 36.4% from 20.0%. This implies that CoPz(S-Bu)8 plays an important role in the photocatalytic process. Meanwhile, the active surface sites on the composite catalyst are covered with CoPz(S-Bu)8, so the catalytic efficiency of composite CoPz(S-Bu)8/SiO2@Fe3O4 mainly derives from the CoPz(S-Bu)8, rather than any significant effect from bare SiO2@Fe3O4. At the same time, the conversion was not raised when the catalyst loading of CoPz(S-Bu)8 was increased by a factor of 20 in entry 10. This demonstrated that the CoPz(S-Bu)8 showed obvious photocatalytic activity for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol into benzoic acid, with a biomimetic structure beneficial to high selectivity to avoid over-oxidation of the substrate, and the carrier Al2O3@Fe3O4 had also a positive effect on oxidation reaction. In view of the chemical inertness and stability of the silica coating (Peng et al., 2001) as well as the semiconducting properties of Fe3O4, some positive influence on the photocatalytic activity of CoPz(S-Bu)8 may be derived from Fe3O4 because of possible defects in the compact SiO2 coating. Different additives were added into the reaction system respectively, at a one-to-one molar ratio with the substrate. IBAL (entry 1) could not promote the reaction because it is insoluble in water and is a reducing compound that tends to consume oxidants. From Table 2 it can be seen that alkaline additives, such as KOH (entry 2), K2CO3 (entry 3) and DBU (entry 4), were beneficial to both the conversion of benzyl alcohol and the selectivity for benzoic acid. Meanwhile, acidic additives, such as H2SO4 (entry 5), HCl (entry 6), AcOH (entry 7) and NH4Cl (entry 8), dramatically promoted the conversion of benzyl alcohol, but the selectivity for benzoic acid was slightly decreased. Therefore, K2CO3 was the optimal additive taking all factors into consideration. The photochemical oxidation of benzyl alcohol has been studied (Hansen and Sydnes, 1989) and several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the diversity of products obtained under various conditions. The present study demonstrated higher selectivity for the oxidation product benzoic acid, and the active species were further examined in the presence of the composite catalyst CoPz(S-Bu)8/SiO2@Fe3O4 by EPR spectroscopy. No obvious signals of superoxide anion radical (O2 −) were detected in EPR experiments using free radical trapping; however, strong signals of hydroxyl radical (HO) were detected, as shown in Fig. 4 . This implied that the HO radical is the main reactive oxygen species in the presence of the catalyst. The different additives markedly affected the signal strength of HO, such that the signal strength of HO was higher for acidic additives than for alkaline additives; this result was consistent with the corresponding effects of additives on catalytic activity. However, the selectivity for benzoic acid was slightly decreased in the presence of acidic additives compared with alkaline additives."
8,Stability and repeatability of composite CoPz(S-Bu)8/SiO2@Fe3O4,"2.3 Stability and repeatability of composite CoPz(S-Bu)8/SiO2@Fe3O4 Because the CoPz(S-Bu)8/SiO2@Fe3O4 catalyst possessed the advantages of easy separation and recycling, the repeatability and stability of CoPz(S-Bu)8/SiO2@Fe3O4 were also investigated, and the results for five repeated catalytic cycles are shown in Fig. 5 . The results indicated that CoPz(S-Bu)8 was stable based on the DRS results shown as curve b in Fig. 3, although the catalytic activity did decrease slightly because of the limited physical absorption between CoPz(S-Bu)8 and SiO2. The catalytic efficiency of CoPz(S-Bu)8/SiO2@Fe3O4 is not very satisfactory in terms of the conversion rate in comparison to other catalysts in previous works (Beydoun et al., 2002). Possibly, the SiO2 coating hindered the transfer of electrons or active oxygen from Fe3O4 to CoPz(S-Bu)8 on the SiO2@Fe3O4 carrier, (Liu et al., 2017; Benferrah et al., 2016) suppressing the photocatalytic reaction."
9,Oxidation of substituted benzyl alcohol catalyzed by CoPz(S-Bu)8/SiO2@Fe3O4,"2.4 Oxidation of substituted benzyl alcohol catalyzed by CoPz(S-Bu)8/SiO2@Fe3O4 The oxidation of substituted benzyl alcohols photocatalyzed by CoPz(S-Bu)8/SiO2@Fe3O4 under optimal reaction conditions was conducted, as shown in Table 3 . The experimental results showed that the conversion rate of substituted benzyl alcohols was higher than that of benzyl alcohol. This demonstrated that substituents on the benzene ring have some influence on the conversion. With an electron-withdrawing substituent on the benzene ring, such as shown in entry 1, the conversion is relatively lower; meanwhile with an electron-donating substituent on the benzene ring, such as in entry 2, 3, 4 and 5, the conversion is relatively high, especially for substitution on the para-position of the benzene ring. Whether a substituent is electron-withdrawing or electron-donating, as long as it can be beneficial to activation of the α-hydrogen of benzyl alcohol, the corresponding alcohol will have a good conversion rate."
10,Conclusions,"To enhance the catalytic activity and recoverability of the catalyst, the cobalt octkis(butylthio) porphyrazines complex (CoPz(S-Bu)8) was immobilized on silica-coated magnetic nanospheres (SiO2@Fe3O4). The photocatalytic activity of CoPz(S-Bu)8/SiO2@Fe3O4 was assessed through oxidation of benzyl alcohol in water under Xe-lamp irradiation using H2O2. It was demonstrated that the CoPz(S-Bu)8 catalyst possesses high capability for the activation of H2O2. Both acidic and alkaline additives promoted the conversion of benzyl alcohol, while the alkaline additive was more beneficial to high selectivity for benzoic acid. With the aid of EPR free-radical trapping experiments, it was demonstrated that HO· is the main reactive oxygen species in this photocatalytic process. Meanwhile, the substituents of benzyl alcohol have an influence on its conversion, with electron-donating substituents on the benzene ring of benzyl alcohol leading to enhanced conversion to the corresponding acid. The catalytic efficiency of CoPz(S-Bu)8/SiO2@Fe3O4 is not very satisfactory from the viewpoint of conversion rate, but its selectivity and eco-friendliness are advantageous. This work provides valuable information for the organic chemical industry."
