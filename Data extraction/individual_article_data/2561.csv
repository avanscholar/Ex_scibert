0,Introduction,"Over the past two decades, chemical and pharmaceutical industry aims to switch from batchwise mode of operation to a continuous production in order to intensify the reaction process in terms of increased product yield and quality, to improve process safety, to reduce the amount of catalyst or to simplify scale-up [1]. While most of the reactions of the so-called “flow-chemistry” contain only a liquid or gas phase, the integration of solid catalyst still presents a major challenge in reaction engineering during the realization of continuous three-phase reactions. Flow reactors containing parallel flow channels which are packed with catalyst particles, so called pellet string reactors, represent a promising concept [2]. In contrast to mini or micro fixed bed reactors, the catalyst particles are of the same dimension as the reactor diameter. Therefore the risk of fluid maldistribution in the catalyst bed is minimized. The concept of the pellet string (PSR) reactor has been well-known for a long time and has been employed for measuring mass transfer coefficients, mostly in gas-phase reactions. Some examples are the publications of Scott et al. [3], Lee et al. [4], Sharma et al. [5], Solcova et al. [6,7] and Takacs et al. [8]. Works on gas–liquid–solid applications are rarer. A pellet string of large particles (8.2mm) was employed by Satterfield et al. [9] to investigate mass transfer limitations for the hydrogenation of alpha-methylstyrene to cumene. More recently, Kallinikos et al. [10,11] and Hipolito et al. [12] have published results on the application of a pellet string reactor for kinetic studies, e.g. for the hydrodesulphurization of heavy gasoil fractions. They also showed that it is possible to obtain a very close residence time distribution for two-phase flow in this type of reactor [10,12]. A detailed characterization of the mass transfer and hydrodynamic behavior for a three-phase reaction has been presented lately by Haase et al. [13] and Langsch et al. [14,15] based on the hydrogenation of alpha-methylstyrene. Regarding the good performance of the PSR, in addition to the application in catalyst screening, the parallelization of multiple packed channels in the millimeter range as a channel array presents an interesting concept for the production of fine chemicals. For instance, monolith substrates can form the inert channel walls and are packed with spherical catalyst particles. A few examples of this integrated packing have been presented by Kapteijn et al. [16], Dautzenberg et al. [17] and Bauer et al. [2,13]. The latter has shown a high performance for the hydrogenation of alpha-methylstyrene. Different terms have been employed to describe this type of packing, including “structured trickle-bed reactor” [2,16], “composite structured packing” [17] and “composite minichannel reactor” [13]. In this work the term multi-channel pellet string reactor (MPSR) will be used. It represents a scale-up concept based on the numbering-up from one channel to several parallel channels of the same dimension. This approach is generally applied in mini and micro reactors to enlarge the production capacity while still preserving the benefits of the small dimensions [18]. Whereas reaction studies to characterize mass transfer have been carried out with different hydrogenation reactions, so far no investigations on the application of this reactor concept for a selective reaction have been published. This work will therefore focus on the investigation of a PSR for the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CAL) to hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL) as a model reaction to prove the beneficial reactor performance. The synthesis of a large number of fine chemicals, particularly in the field of flavor and fragrance chemistry and pharmaceuticals, involves the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated carbonyl intermediates as a critical step. The heterogeneously catalyzed hydrogenation of CAL over a palladium catalyst in the solvent toluene yields HCAL as main product and hydrocinnamyl alcohol (HCOL) as side product. In accordance with other publications, the intermediate cinnamyl alcohol (COL) cannot be detected [19–22]. As the unsaturated alcohol is the main desired product demanded from the industry, another catalyst, like platinum, should also be tested in the future. Kinetic studies with palladium catalysts have shown that HCOL is formed only via the COL route and not from HCAL. Thus, the reaction network is formed by two parallel reactions (Fig. 1 ). In this contribution, results from first experimental studies in a single PSR will be presented. For comparison reaction kinetics will be determined in a batch reactor system. In all cases commercial egg-shell catalysts are employed (0.5% or 1.0% Pd/γ-alumina). The scale-up to multiple channels (MPSR) will be carried out and first conclusions regarding the impact of the different process parameters are deducted."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals and gases,"2.1 Chemicals and gases Reaction studies were carried out with a solution of 50kg/m3 (380mol/m3) trans-cinnamaldehyde (C9H8O, 98%, abcr) in toluene (C7H8, >99.8%, Fisher Scientific). Two different commercial Pd/γ-Al2O3 egg-shell catalysts were used (0.5% Pd/γ-Al2O3, 3.0mm (A); 1.0% Pd/γ-Al2O3, 1.8–2.0mm (B)). The main catalyst properties are given in Table 1 . Prior to reaction the catalyst was reduced at 210°C and 10bar (a) for 4h under flowing hydrogen. All chemicals and commercial catalyst particles were used as received. Gases used are of 5.0 purity (Air Liquide)."
3,Reaction studies,"2.2 Reaction studies Reaction studies were carried out isothermally at 353K and a hydrogen pressure between 10bar and 30bar. The reaction conditions as well as characteristic dimensionless numbers regarding hydrodynamics are summarized in Table 2 . Isothermal operation was assured by monitoring the inlet and outlet temperature and regarding the moderate reaction enthalpy and low conversion. The following procedure was applied for all experiments. First the pressure was adjusted by feeding hydrogen into the system and adjusting the pressure controller. Then the reactor was flushed with liquid to ensure full wetting of the catalyst bed. Afterwards the desired liquid flow rate was set at the pump. Once the system temperature reached a stationary point, the hydrogen flow was set by the mass flow controllers. The system was allowed to reach a steady state, usually after 60min. This was checked by analyzing liquid samples taken at the reactor outlet at several times during a run (every 10–20min). Sample analysis was performed offline by an Agilent 6890N GC equipped with an HP-1 column and an FID detector. First reaction studies were carried out to evaluate the performance of the PSR. During the experiments the flow regime was observed so that a regular slug flow was maintained at all times. Studies on the influence of different process parameters were carried out, including the effect of liquid velocity, gas holdup and pressure. Superficial liquid velocity u L,s and gas velocity u G,s were calculated based on the reactor cross-sectional area S R and the volumetric flow rate V ˙ for the prevailing reaction temperature T R and pressure p R (Eqs. (1)–(3)) (STP – standard temperature T STP and pressure p STP). Superficial liquid velocity: (1) u L , s = V ˙ L S R Superficial gas velocity: (2) u G , s = V ˙ G S R = V ˙ G , STP S R p STP ⋅ T R p R ⋅ T STP Gas holdup: (3) H G = u G , s u G , s + u L , s To characterize the reactor performance the conversion of CAL X CAL was calculated according to Eq. (4) and the selectivity to HCAL S HCAL according to Eq. (5), assuming volume constancy. (4) X CAL = 1 − c CAL ∑ c i (5) S HCAL = c HCAL c HCAL + c HCOL The reaction rate can be considered as limited by external and internal mass transfer effects. Calculations of the Thiele modulus based on experiments in a batch stirred tank reactor revealed a catalyst efficiency of less than 50%, caused by the rather high thickness of the active catalyst layer. In order to compare both reactor concepts the surface specific reaction rate r S was calculated based on the geometric surface area of the catalyst particles (S P ), the conversion and the initial concentration of CAL c CAL,0 according to Eq. (6). A comparison based on the mass of palladium would lead to deceptive results, as only part of the active metal is utilized. (6) r S = c CAL , 0 ⋅ X CAL ⋅ V ˙ L S P ."
4,Reactor setups,"2.3 Reactor setups Two different experimental setups were designed and installed to test the reactor concepts. The main parameters are summarized in Table 3 . The first setup in laboratory scale for the PSR was designed similarly to the setup proposed by Haase et al. [23] for concurrent downflow (Fig. 2 ). Gas flow from compressed gas cylinders was adjusted by 4 different mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst, flow range 2.0–100,000Ncm3/min), liquid was pumped by a pulsation-free HPLC pump (Agilent, SD-1, flow range 0–200cm3/min). The connecting pipes and the reactor were heated electrically to maintain the reaction temperature and temperatures were recorded by several thermocouples (type K). Pressure resistant glass channels (Bohemia Crystal) were installed before and after the reactor to observe the flow regime. Gas and liquid were mixed by injecting the gas into the liquid to produce regular slug flow. The occurring two-phase flow was recorded by a high-speed video camera system (VDS-Vosskuehler, HCC1000, illumination: multiLED, GS Vitec). A sampling valve was installed behind the reactor to collect liquid samples. After the passage, the two-phase flow was separated inside a separation vessel. A manual pressure controller (Tescom, type 26) was installed in the outlet gas line to regulate the system pressure over a wide range. The system pressure was monitored by pressure transmitters (Baumer, 0…250bar) before and after the reactor. The reactor consisted of a stainless steel tube (1.4301, ID 2.4mm, OD 6mm), the catalyst bed was fixed inside by wire mesh. For the MPSR a larger scale setup for concurrent upflow operation was designed. Downflow operation was not possible due to the very high liquid demand to achieve slug flow. Gas flow from compressed gas cylinders was adjusted by 4 different mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst, Brooks, flow range 8.0–233,000Ncm3/min), liquid was pumped by a pulsation-free HPLC pump (Agilent, SD-1, flow range 0–800cm3/min). The connecting pipes and the reactor were heated electrically. A sampling valve was installed behind the reactor to collect liquid samples. The pressure was adjusted with two overflow valves after the reactor outlet. After the passage, the two-phase flow was separated inside a separation vessel. The system pressure was monitored by pressure transmitters (Baumer, 0…160bar) before and after the reactor. The reactor consisted of a stainless steel tube (38mm×2.5mm) of 600mm length. At the bottom a gas distributor was installed (perforated plate, 37 holes) to generate a homogeneous bubble flow of gas and liquid at the chosen velocities [24] (checked by CFD simulations). The catalyst bed was fixed 11.5cm above the gas distributor (Fig. 2), i.e. more than three times the reactor diameter. Therefore a fully developed homogeneous bubble flow was assumed according to Wilkinson et al. [25]. Monolithic substrates (39cpsi, cordierite, IKTS Hermsdorf) were employed to form 32 parallel channels which were filled with catalyst particles. 4 monolith segments (100mm length) were aligned and stacked on top of each other to form a bed length of 400mm. The catalyst particles were inserted manually and fixed by wire mesh on both sides of the bed. In order to avoid catalyst by-pass phenomena, empty monolith channels were inactivated and the monolith segments were wrapped with a PTFE bandage before being loaded in the reactor, thus reducing the clearance between the monolith and the reactor wall."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Pellet string reactor (PSR),"3.1 Pellet string reactor (PSR) 3.1.1 Hydrodynamic flow observations In order to achieve high mass transfer rates and a narrow residence time distribution, it has been proven to be beneficial to work in the slug flow regime [10,13]. Therefore experimental conditions were chosen to produce a gas–liquid slug flow in the empty channel before the catalytic packing. Some selected examples at different flow conditions are shown in Fig. 3 . It can be seen that the slug flow leads to a good wetting of the catalyst bed and a periodical exposition of the catalyst to the gas phase. Sometimes gas bubble coalescence was observed in the empty channel when slugs became too thin and especially at low liquid velocity and gas holdup, leading to a slightly irregular flow pattern. Furthermore, in most cases coalescence and break-up of bubbles inside the packing occurred caused by the changing acceleration between the spheres. The open cross-section in the packed bed ranges from 4.1mm2 to 1.7mm2, thus leading to an acceleration of the interstitial velocity by factor 2.5. That is why flow irregularities in the empty channel are assumed to have only minor impact on the reactor performance. 3.1.2 Variation of liquid velocity Reaction studies on the effect of the liquid velocity were conducted at constant hydrogen pressure (10bar) and gas holdup (0.5). The observed cinnamaldehyde conversion for different flow conditions inside the PSR is depicted in Fig. 4 and reveals two different effects. Between 0.02m/s and 0.08m/s the conversion decreases with increasing velocity as the residence time in the reactor is reduced. In contrast, at the lowest velocity 0.01m/s the conversion is considerably lower compared to 0.02m/s, although the residence time is even higher. While the three points follow a linear dependence with a slope proportional to the reaction rate, the point at 0.01m/s differs significantly. This effect could be explained by strong external mass transfer limitations or a reduced catalyst wetting. As proven by several authors [13,14,26], external mass transfer in packed mini-channels is considerably lower at a small two-phase velocity. Based on a mass transfer correlation for gas–liquid–solid reactions in a PSR proposed by Langsch et al. [14], an overall mass transfer coefficient of 0.4s−1 up to 1.81s−1 was estimated for the given reaction conditions. As the coefficient is almost linearly dependent on the liquid velocity, the decreasing mass transfer rate does not serve alone to explain the very low conversion at 0.1m/s. During the experiments at low velocity, stagnant gas bubbles in the packing were observed by the high-speed video camera. This results in an incomplete use of the active catalyst surface as the transport of reaction mixture to the catalyst is hindered and therefore only a low conversion can be achieved. Based on these findings, an optimization between good wetting and a high residence time should be done. 3.1.3 Variation of gas holdup and hydrogen pressure A variation of gas holdup at one specific liquid phase velocity was generated by increasing the gas feed flow rate. This also increases the two-phase velocity, thus causing a shorter residence time in the reactor. In turn, a lower conversion would be expected. On the other hand, higher gas holdup also improves the external mass transfer, which has been observed in a PSR for example by Kallinikos et al. [26], Haase et al. [13] and Langsch et al. [15] as well as in traditional fixed bed reactors in general [27]. An increase of superficial gas velocity is supposed to improve mass transfer based on two different phenomena. The thickness of the laminar boundary layers is reduced due to enhanced turbulences created by the higher interstitial velocities which results in higher mass transfer coefficients. Secondly, increasing gas holdup also affects the interfacial gas–solid and gas–liquid areas positively. As Langsch et al. [15] proposed, the gas–liquid area is further enlarged because smaller gas bubbles are produced due to bubble breakup at higher velocity. As shown in Fig. 5 , the positive effect of enhanced mass transfer prevails in the system, leading to a significant increase in conversion with higher gas holdup. Furthermore, the conversion of CAL benefits from an increased hydrogen pressure. This can be explained by an increased hydrogen solubility in the solvent toluene from 37.1mol/m3 (10bar) to 111.2mol/m3 (30bar) according to the correlation of Jáuregui-Haza et al. [28]. The positive effect of higher gas holdup was observed similarly for both pressures."
7,Multi-channel reactor,"3.2 Multi-channel reactor Reaction studies on the influence of gas holdup and liquid velocity were also performed in the scale-up concept, the multi-channel reactor. For the gas holdup similar trends compared to the PSR were observed (Fig. 6 ), proving the applicability of the concept in general. At the lowest liquid velocity, the impact of gas holdup on the conversion is even more pronounced. In contrast, the effect of liquid velocity gives interesting results. At the lowest gas holdup (0.45) liquid velocity hardly affects the conversion, whereas it has a significant impact at higher gas holdups. Also the selectivity shows different trends for the lowest velocity compared to higher values (Fig. 7 ). This indicates very strong mass transfer limitations and deviation from plug flow caused by backmixing in the low velocity range and shows the necessity of a thorough reactor characterization during scale-up."
8,Residence time distribution,"3.3 Residence time distribution Orienting residence time distribution analyses were undertaken in the PSR at u L,s =0.04m/s and a gas holdup of 0.5 and in the MPSR at the lowest liquid velocity (0.8·10−3 m/s) and a gas holdup of 0.45. The results show a very broad distribution for the MPSR, which serves to explain the low selectivity at this flow conditions. A Péclet number of approx. 2 can be estimated for an axial dispersion model. On the one hand that might be caused by backmixing effects due to the slow upflow. On the other hand bypass flow might occur as the channels in the MPSR have a square cross section, thus liquid can pass by the catalyst particles easier at the corners compared to a channel with round cross section. In the literature, it was already shown that the residence time distribution for a single PSR is supposed to be rather narrow for two-phase slug flow [10,12]. An example for a residence time distribution for the PSR is shown in Fig. 8 . The results obtained from step response studies indicate a cell number of N =16 when a cell model is applied or a Péclet number of 30 for an axial dispersion model. This corresponds to the good selectivity that was achieved for the PSR in the reaction studies and matches well with the correlation for the Péclet number proposed by Kallinikos et al. [10]. Further residence time studies to verify this behavior for the PSR are currently under preparation."
9,Comparison of reactor concepts,"3.4 Comparison of reactor concepts Most interesting for a commercial application is a comparison of the reactor concepts regarding the achievable selectivity and reaction rate. Results for the selectivity are presented in Fig. 7. In general a high selectivity of around 90% toward HCAL was achieved in the single PSR. It was found, that the selectivity is relatively independent of the gas holdup and only moderately affected by the hydrogen pressure, whereas elevated pressure reduces the selectivity. In contrast, the MPSR achieves a significantly poorer selectivity, depending on the liquid velocity and gas holdup. Different effects can be observed for the different liquid velocities. The selectivity is worst at the lowest liquid velocity (0.8·10−3 m/s) and is further reduced by increasing gas holdup. In contrast, at higher liquid velocity, increasing the gas holdup has a positive effect on the selectivity. For the latter case, the selectivity reaches almost the values of the single PSR. This shows again the strong impact of the flow conditions on the reactor performance. The low selectivity indicates strong backmixing in the MPSR at low liquid throughput which is further impaired by a high gas holdup. A very low Péclet number of only around 2 was estimated by residence time distribution studies, as discussed in Section 3.3. With increasing liquid velocity flow conditions should resemble plug flow, thus leading to an improved performance. For further comparison batch experiments were performed with the same catalysts assuming the absence of external mass transfer limitations and ideal mixing. The achieved selectivity at a conversion of 16% is about the same as in the single PSR (92.8%), as shown in Fig. 9 . For the MPSR the selectivity of the batch experiments is almost achieved for the higher liquid velocities, whereas for the lowest liquid velocity the selectivity is certainly lower (around 73%). An additional comparison based on the surface specific reaction rate and the space velocity is presented in Fig. 10 . In general it was found that the reaction rate increases with rising space velocity up to a certain optimum due to the reduction of external mass transfer limitations. For the PSR at 10bar an opposite trend for higher space velocities is already indicated, which is caused by the reduced residence time in the reactor. Also as expected, the reaction rate is slightly increased with higher pressure. As a result of the low space velocity in the MPSR also the reaction rate is considerably lower. On the other hand, it shows the same trend as the single PSR, thus, a comparable reaction rate can be expected for operation at higher space velocity. In addition also the selectivity would be influenced positively with rising space velocity as already shown in Section 3.2."
10,Conclusions,"In this contribution two reactor concepts based on a pellet string reactor were evaluated for the continuous selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to hydrocinnamaldehyde. The PSR can present an interesting concept for the production of fine chemicals compared to conventional batch reactors. As a mini-scale fixed bed reactor it offers easy catalyst handling without separation steps and provides a high heat transfer capacity. By applying a defined flow regime (slug flow) in each reaction channel, very efficient catalyst wetting and a close residence time distribution can be achieved. Therefore a high selectivity can be reached, that is comparable to the performance of a batch reactor. Scale-up can be easily done by parallelization of several channels (numbering-up). Based on optimization studies in a single channel, the optimum conditions for production can be identified with less time and resources. During scale-up special care has to be taken of the hydrodynamics. It was shown that it is possible to reach the selectivity from batch experiments also in the multi-channel PSR as long as the liquid velocity is sufficiently high. A direct comparison of the reactor concepts is difficult at this stage, as the liquid velocity differs in approximately one order of magnitude and the systems were operated in different flow modes. Furthermore, effects of liquid maldistribution, external mass transfer and by-passing on the reactor performance should be evaluated quantitatively in more detail before a final conclusion about the simplicity of scale-up can be drawn. Nevertheless, first experiments indicate that the results generated in a single channel can be transferred to a larger scale reactor with multiple parallel channels while still achieving comparable reaction rate and selectivity. Therefore the potential of this reactor concept will be further investigated so it can be eventually applied also for commercial syntheses. Future work will focus on the application of a gas and liquid distributor for the MPSR to generate a constant slug flow also in downflow operation in order to further study the effect of residence time distribution on the reactor performance. Moreover, additional reaction studies should be carried out in a random fixed bed reactor to evaluate the impact of the structured bed."
