0,Introduction,"Maleimides have been studied as photo-initiators in photo-curable systems (for example, Clark et al., 1997) because they produce radical anions or triplet states by the absorption of UV light. Especially, many photochemical studies have been made on triplet states of maleimides and N-alkyl maleimides in aqueous and alcohol solutions (Hayon and Simic, 1972; Ayscough and Elliot, 1975, 1976; Von Sonntag et al., 1999, 2002; Von Sonntag and Knolle, 2000). Radicals produced during photolysis of alcohol solutions of maleimides are categorized into two types; one is H-adduct radicals formed by tacking of a hydrogen atom on C=C double bond of maleimides and the other is adduct radicals formed by tacking of solvent-fragmented radicals, which are fragmented from solvent molecules, on maleimides (Ayscough and Elliot, 1976). Of course, a hydrogen atom is abstracted from a solvent molecule by the triplet maleimide during formation of the former radicals, and during formation of the latter radicals (Ayscough and Elliot, 1976; Von Sonntag et al., 1999; Aida et al., 1989). Such adduct radicals are observed in pulse radiolysis studies of an aqueous solution of N-ethylmaleimide and maleimide in the presence of an alcohol (Hayon and Simic, 1972; Ayscough and Elliot, 1975). An anion radical of maleimide is also obserbed in UV-light irradiated dimethylformamide (Aida et al., 1989). As described above, UV-light irradiation of maleimides has intensively been studied for a few decades; however, there are few reports about γ-irradiation of N-hydroxymaleimide. Recently, hydroxyphthalimide and hydroxysuccinimide, whose structures are shown in Fig. 1, were irradiated with γ-ray in alcohol solvents such as methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), 2-propanol (2-PrOH), and acetonitrile (MeCN) (Nakagawa, 2005). The report says that phthalimide and succinimide are mainly produced through electron attachment to the hydroxyimides in MeCN. However, hydrogen is abstracted from the –NOH group in hydroxysuccinimide by the alcohol cations, and this process competes with the electron transfer to hydroxysuccinimide, resulting in very low degradation efficiency of hydroxysuccinimide in alcohol solvents. To clarify which process is dominant for γ-irradiation of hydroxymaleimide in alcohol solvents among several candidates such as electron transfer, charge transfer, hydrogen abstraction by solvent (alcohol) cations, or addition of solvent (alcohol) radicals, hydroxymaleimide was irradiated with γ-ray in MeOH and 2-PrOH in the present work."
1,Experimental,"Hydroxymaleimide and the dehydrated solvents (MeOH and 2-PrOH) were supplied by Aldrich and Wako-Junyaku, respectively, and were used as received. Sample solutions were prepared by diluting hydroxymaleimide into solvent at a concentration of 0.1mol% (1.3×10−2 and 2.2×10−2 mol/L in MeOH and 2-PrOH, respectively). Some samples were purged with pure nitrogen and irradiated with keeping nitrogen-saturated condition. Others were purged with pure nitrogen and irradiated with exposure to air, and the others were purged with pure oxygen. Purging duration was a few minutes. All irradiations were conducted with 60Co γ-ray source, of which activity was 185TBq, at a dose rate of 2.1kGy/h. To estimate dose rate effect, samples were also irradiated at dose rates of 250 and 125Gy/h. For each irradiation, about 10ml of each sample was prepared in a glass vessel and irradiated at ambient temperature. The irradiated sample solutions were analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC: Agilent, HP1100) using a reversed phase column (ODS, 25.0cm×4.0mm i.d.) at 40°C. Eluent was water with v/v. 50% MeCN (Wako-Junyaku, for HPLC solvent) and the flow rate was 0.3ml/min. Resolved compounds were detected by light absorption at 210nm in wavelength. To prevent the signal of alcohol from overlapping those of solutes in the HPLC measurements, alcohols were evaporated from 0.1ml of irradiated sample solutions and residuals of the solutions were dissolved in 10ml of MeCN. A liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer (LC/MS: Agilent) was also used for identification of unknown products; in other words, products whose standard chemicals were not preliminary known. The negative mode of electron spray was employed for ionization of the unknown products, and fragmentator voltage was varied from 70 to 150V in order to change internal energy of target molecules. Note that in this operation mode, the mass numbers of anions are smaller in value than those of their parent molecules by a unity for loss of hydrogen."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Products identification,"3.1 Products identification The parent species, hydroxymaleimide, was detected at 7.0min in retention time under the given HPLC conditions. Products formed upon radiolysis in oxygen free MeOH and 2-PrOH solutions were observed at A 5.8, B 6.0, and C 6.3min and at D 6.0, E 6.2, and F 6.5min, respectively. Parts of ejected products corresponding peaks A–F including with hydroxymaleimide were injected into mass spectrometer, LC/MS, in order to identify them. With LC/MS measurements, there appeared two ions whose m/z values are 112 and 225 for hydroxymaleimide. The former was mainly observed with a fragmentator voltage of 150V, and the latter was obtained with a smaller voltage of 70V. The mass numbers of the precursor of both ions are 113 and 226, respectively. The former is hydroxymaleimide monomer and the latter is a dimer of hydroxymaleimide by hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl groups. It is supposed that hydroxyl imides and their derivatives will be introduced into the ionization region as a hydrogen-bonded dimer for LC/MS measurements, and decomposed into two molecules by higher fragmentator voltage. As for the products obtained in MeOH solutions A–C, these are the following findings. There are two ions, I1 and I2, whose m/z values are 289 and 144, respectively, in the product corresponding to peak C. I2 was dominantly observed with fragmentator voltage of 150V while I1 was main component with a smaller voltage of 70V. The mass numbers of the precursor of I1 and I2 are 290 and 145, respectively, and the former is twice that of the latter. Therefore, it is deduced that the precursor of I1 would be a hydrogen-bonded dimer to that of I2. This trend was identified as hydroxymaleimide itself as mentioned in the previous paragraph. From these considerations, product C is assigned to C2H3CH3O(CO)2-NOH, which is produced via hydrogen abstraction following attachment of MeOH radical (•CH2OH) to the C=C double bond of hydroxymaleimide and has a mass number of 145. Similarly, product B consisted of two ions, I3 and I4, whose m/z values are 227 and 114, respectively. The former ion was dominantly observed with a fragmentator voltage of 70V and the mass number of the precursor is 228. The latter was observed only with a fragmentator voltage of 150V and its m/z value is just half of the mass number of the precursor of I3. I3 was produced by loss of hydrogen from the precursor anion. On the contrary, I4 will be produced by decomposition of the precursor anion into halves, because of the higher internal energy given by higher fragmentator voltage. I4, whose m/z value is 114, would be (C2H3(CO)2-NOH)−. Then product B could be assigned to (C2H3(CO)2-NOH)2. Based on this assignment, it is deduced that anion of hydroxymaleimide would also be produced and dimerization through anion would occur similarly as in the case of photo-induced reactions (Aida et al., 1989). There were also two ions in the product corresponding to product A. These ions, I5 and I6, showed m/z values of 287 and 257, respectively, and the latter was dominantly observed. Because the difference in mass numbers of I5 and I6 would correspond to mass number of CH2O group, I5 and I6 would be produced by loss of hydrogen and •CH2OH from the same precursor anion, of which the mass number is 288. The product A would be assigned to (C2H2CH3O(CO)2-NOH)2. Finally, it is suggested that the addition of the alcohol radical, •CH2OH, to the C=C double bond of hydroxymaleimide would occur in MeOH because of production of A and C. Concerning the LC/MS analyses of the products D–F in 2-PrOH solutions, the following things were found. In the product corresponding to product D, an ion with an m/z value of 227 was seen. This peak would be the same as product B observed in the case of MeOH. Product F consisted of two ions I7 and I8, whose m/z values are 345 and 172, respectively. I7 was mainly detected with the fragmentator voltage of 70V while I8 becomes dominant with higher fragmentator voltage, 150V. The mass numbers of the precursor of I7 and I8 are 346 and 173, respectively, and the former is twice of the latter. Then, the precursor of I7 would be a hydrogen-bonded dimer of that of I8, and product F would be assigned to C2H3C3H7O(CO)2-NOH, which is produced via hydrogen abstraction following the attachment of propanol radical to the C=C double bond of hydroxymaleimide. There were three ions in the product corresponding to product E. These ions, I9, I10, and I11, showed m/z values of 377, 188, and 130, respectively. The mass numbers of the precursor of I9 and I10 are 378 and 189, respectively, and the former would be a hydrogen-bonded dimer of the latter. I11 appeared with the fragmentator voltage of 150V. Because the difference in mass numbers of I10 and I11 would correspond to the mass number of C3H6O group, I10 and I11 would be produced by loss of hydrogen and •C3H7O from the same precursor anion, of which the mass number is 189. I11, whose m/z value is 130, would be assigned to (C2H2OH(CO)2-NOH)−. Product E could be assigned to C2H2(OH)C3H7O(CO)2-NOH. Finally, because of the production of E and F, it is suggested that the adduct reaction of the propanol radical to the C=C double bond of hydroxymaleimide would occur in 2-PrOH as well as in MeOH. Spectra obtained in the HPLC measurements were also analyzed in terms of peak area; in other words, concentrations of parent molecule (hydroxymaleimide) and products were evaluated. Then, absolute value of hydroxymaleimide concentration and relative values of product concentrations were estimated as a function of dose as shown in Fig. 2. Note that the absolute values of concentrations of products could not be determined because of the lack of standard chemicals, and that these concentrations are expressed as areas of the peaks including each product in chromatogram instead of absolute values. Consequently, the number of molecules for the degradation of hydroxymaleimide in MeOH and 2-PrOH by absorbance of energy of 1eV, G-value/100, were calculated using the data between doses of 0 and 1kGy, whose results are listed in Table 1 in comparison to those of hydroxysuccinimide and hydroxyphthalimide. As seen in the table, the degradation efficiency of hydroxymaleimide was several times larger than that of hydroxysuccinimide and hydroxyphthalimide, showing difference of degradation mechanism between hydroxymaleimide and other hydroxyl imides."
4,Effects of oxygen in 2-PrOH solution.,"3.2 Effects of oxygen in 2-PrOH solution. 2-PrOH solutions of hydroxymaleimide purged with oxygen and nitrogen were irradiated up to 2kGy, whose chromatograms are shown in Fig. 3 as dashed and solid lines, respectively. As seen in the figure, the peak intensities at the retention times of 6.5 and 7.0 decrease and increase, respectively, due to the presence of oxygen. Then, it is clear that the production yield of the adduct radical as well as the degradation efficiency of hydroxymaleimide is inhibited by oxygen. Instead, new products appeared at the retention times of 4.8, 5.2, and 6.3min in the oxygen-saturated solution. Similar measurement was also conducted with MeOH solvent. The new products seen in 2-PrOH solution were not observed in MeOH solution although the production of radical adducts was restricted in 2-PrOH solution as well. Then, it can be said that the new products were produced not by oxidation of hydroxymaleimide itself but by reaction with oxidized species derived from solvent. With LC/MS measurements, only one kind of ion was observed and no spectral variation was obtained by changing fragmentator voltage for each new product that appeared in the oxygen-saturated system. Therefore, these products could not be assigned well. Dose dependences of concentrations of hydroxymaleimide irradiated with oxygen-saturated and with exposed air after being purged by nitrogen in 2-PrOH solution, are plotted in Fig. 4. At the beginning of irradiation for oxygen-saturated system, solvent radicals prefer to react with oxygen molecule and its derivatives because of the larger concentration of oxygen. Therefore, the degradation of hydroxymaleimide was restricted. When the concentration of oxygen deduced to the order as air-saturated one (about 2×10−3 mol/L in propanol), hydroxymaleimide could participate in the reaction mechanism. Both products obtained with nitrogen-saturated system and with oxygen-saturated one were found in the sample irradiated with exposed air. These results indicate that the addition of the solvent radical would compete with reaction with oxidized species derived from solvent under the air-exposed condition. The G-value/100 of the degradation of hydroxymaleimide in 2-PrOH under the air-exposed condition was 0.23, which is about 40% of that obtained in nitrogen-saturated condition."
5,Dose rate effect,"3.3 Dose rate effect To estimate dose rate effect, oxygen free 2-PrOH solutions were also irradiated at dose rates of 250 and 125Gy/h. Dose dependences of concentrations of hydroxymaleimide irradiated at each dose rate are plotted in Fig. 5. It is clearly shown that degradation efficiency increased with decreasing dose rate. The G-value/100 of the degradation of hydroxymaleimide at dose rates of 250 and 125Gy/h were 0.78 and 0.85, which are about 1.5 and 1.7 times larger than that obtained at the dose rate of 2.1kGy/h."
6,Reaction mechanism in the oxygen-free system,"3.4 Reaction mechanism in the oxygen-free system The results of product analysis lead to suggestion of the following decomposition mechanism of hydroxymaleimide in the oxygen-free system: (1) C 2 H 2 ( CO ) 2 ‐ NOH + R • → • C 2 H 2 R ( CO ) 2 ‐ NOH (2) C ⋅ 2 H 2 R ( CO ) 2 ‐ NOH + R ‐ H → C 2 H 3 R ( CO ) 2 ‐ NOH + R • (3) R • + R • → R − R (4) C 2 H 2 ( CO ) 2 ‐ NOH + e sol − → C 2 H 2 ( CO ) 2 ‐ NOH • − (5) C 2 H 2 ( CO ) 2 ‐ NOH + C 2 H 2 ( CO ) 2 ‐ NOH • − → • ( C 2 H 2 ( CO ) 2 ‐ NOH ) 2 − (6) ( C 2 H 2 ( CO ) 2 ‐ NOH ) ⋅ 2 − + R − H + R ‐ H 2 + → ( C 2 H 3 ( CO ) 2 ‐ NOH ) 2 + R • + R ‐ H where R-H is a solvent molecule (R represents CH2OH or C(CH3)2OH for MeOH and 2-PrOH, respectively). Products will be formed by the following process. C2H3R(CO)2-NOH 1 (products C and F) will be produced by hydrogen abstraction of •C2H2R(CO)2-NOH from solvent molecule (Eq. (2)). Hydrogen abstraction from solvent molecule and protonation (Eq. (6)) will lead to the formation of (C2H3(CO)2-NOH)2 2 (products B and E). Radical–radical recombination of two •C2H2CH3O(CO)2-NOH will produce (C2H2CH3O(CO)2-NOH)2 3 (product A). In the process of hydrogen abstraction from solvent molecule, solvent radical R•, which reacts with hydroxymaleimide again through Eq. (1), will be re-produced (Eqs. (2 and 6)). This is the reason for the larger degradation efficiency of hydroxymaleimide. Anion of hydroxysuccinimide or hydroxyphthalimide, produced as the same as Eq. (4), will be subsequently decomposed to hydroxyl radical and anion of H4C2(CO)2-N or H4C6(CO)2-N, and imides will be produced by protonation of anion (Nakagawa, 2005). This is a minor process for hydroxymaleimide. The lifetime of anion will be long enough to dimerize with other hydroxymaleimide molecule (Eq. (5)). It was found that the degradation efficiency increased with decrease in the dose rate. An additional reaction of a solvent radical toward hydroxymaleimide (Eq. (1)) competes with a radical–radical recombination (Eq. (3)). The latter was reduced, with the former leading to efficient degradation of hydroxymaleimide increased by irradiation at lower dose rate."
7,Conclusion,"(1) An addition reaction of a solvent radical was the dominant process to decrease hydroxymaleimide by γ-irradiation in alcohol solutions. The radical adduct abstracts hydrogen from solvent molecule to re-produce a solvent radical. Therefore, the degradation efficiency of hydroxymaleimide was more than ten times larger than that of hydroxyphthalimide and hydroxysuccinimide, of which electron attachment was the main process for degradation. Dimer of hydroxymaleimide was also produced through electron attachment process. (2) The degradation efficiency increased with decrease in the dose rate. Recombination of solvent radicals will be reduced and addition reaction leading to the degradation of hydroxymaleimide will occur efficiently by irradiation at lower dose rate. (3) The production yield of the adduct radical as well as the degradation efficiency of hydroxymaleimide is inhibited by irradiation in the oxygen-saturated system. Instead, new products, which would be produced by reaction of hydroxymaleimide with oxidized species derived from solvent, appeared in the presence of oxygen of 2-PrOH solution."
