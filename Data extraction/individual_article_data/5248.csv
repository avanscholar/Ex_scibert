0,Introduction,"There is an existing challenge of the need to produce environmentally friendly and low-cost composites materials to meet the demands of today's market. Findings by Lau et al. [1] indicated that composites materials, due to high specific-stiffness-to-weight and specific strength-to-weight ratios, have various applications in engineering. The use of biodegradable fibers to produce affordable and effective polymeric reinforced composites has more advantage than the use of synthetic fibers. The need for such engineered materials gave birth to a new area of research which has to do with upgrading functional and structural properties of synthetic polymers with the application of nanotechnology using natural fibers such as wood [2–5]. Many resarchers have reported that choice of natural fiber depends on its potential for being biodegradable, recyclable, and sustainable [6–11]. Final characteristics of resulting composites generally depend on the nature, microstructure, and compositions of the inorganic filler as well as the interfacial interactions of the microstructure of the natural fibers [12,13]. Muhammad et al. [14] reported that the choice of bamboo is established in findings that the desirability of consumers can be eased by its sustainable high-end quality industrial products and the high strength-weight ratio that makes it arguably an attractive alternative to steel in tensile loading applications. Nanocomposites have shown significant improvement in mechanical, thermal, physical as well as decreasing component weight required for engineering material in comparison with conventional macro and micro composites [15–17]. The selection of a suitable inorganic filler that will significantly change the microstructure via effective interactions is vital in the production of suitable nanocomposite materials as shown by Chen et al. [18]. Study carried out by Reddy [19] and Essabir et al. [20] have shown that clay is a suitable material that is used as a nanofiller. Silva et al. [21] compared to conventional filler polymers, clay nanofiller and reported that clay have significantly better physical and mechanical properties. The choice of montmorillonite as nanofiller among various types of clay is as a result of their swelling capacity, high surface-volume ratio, strong absorption/adsorption properties in addition to its high content of alkaline earth metals, and magnesium iron [22]. Additionally, use of clay nanofillers in the polymer industry is rooted in the processing, lightness, and mechanical properties of natural fibers. Manalo et al. [23] reported that the major challenge of bamboo fibers resulting in poor mechanical properties of the composites is the inherent flaws within fibers which reduced their compatibility with polymer matrices. Mousa et al. [24] Gumares et al. [25] and Cheng et al. [26] reported that this poor compatibility was addressed by adding polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and nanofibrils into bamboo and thereby increased its mechanical properties. Another approach to overcome this challenge of poor barrier properties and low mechanical resistance is the introduction of NaOH in formation of nanocomposites which has attracted attention of many researchers such as Chen et al. [27], Zhang et al. [28], Orue et al. [29], Khan et al. [30], Fiore et al. [31], and Oushabi et al. [32] Recent findings by Khan et al. [33] revealed a yield of composites with optimizing reinforcing materials such as NaOH that attained high tensile strength. Response surface method is a statistical tool that can be used to optimize experimental conditions in order to achieve optimum properties. Doehlert Design (DD), 3-level factorial, Box–Benhken Design (BBD), 3-level factorial and Central Composite Design (CCD), are well known response surface methods [34]. Vardhini et al. [35] employed RSM method in optimizing NaOH treatment and rate of removal of lignin in banana fiber. Karuppusamy et al. [36] studied effect of alkaline treatment on bagasse fiber reinforced epoxy composite. They concluded that RSM is an accurate tool for the prediction of optimal conditions in improving the flexural strength of the composite. A study by Manzato et al. [37] reported that RSM was used to determine the optimum parameters for extraction of cellulose and concluded that at NaOH/NaClO ratios of 1.2, 2 h a and temperature of 45 °C optimum extraction conditions for jute fiber pulp were achieved. Rostamiyan et al. [15] developed models using RSM for predicting tensile and impact strength of hybrid nanocomposite. The models gave accurate values when compared with experimental results. Phua et al. [38] have also conducted a recent study on the mechanical behavior of starch-grafted polypropylene/kenaf fiber composites by theoretical modelling using RSM. They obtained models that had predicted values close to the experimental values. Electrospinning parameters RSM models for design and preparation of hybrid nano fibrils were also developed and reported by Ghelich et al. [39]. Hassan et al. [34] on the other hand have utilized 2 factorial function of RSM to study the tensile behavior of banana pseudo-stem reinforced epoxy composite. They obtained results which revealed good agreement of the predicted and experimental values for R2, adjusted R2, and predicted R2. From the various studies reviewed, investigating one factor at a time in preparation of nanocomposites is a major drawback. This is because it fails to address the interactions of the factors involved and at the same time posed difficulty in determining optimum values that can predict optimum responses. Therefore, this study, is aimed at using vacuum impregnation technique in preparation of the bamboo nanocomposites and optimization of clay loading, sodium hydroxide, PVA, and, modification time to develop models for the prediction of MOE and MOR behavior of bamboo nanocomposites using CCD method of RSM. The interactions of the parameters and optimization were studied using Design Expert Software 11.1.0. Some selected nanocomposites based on the RSM results were further characterized to examine their physicochemical, mechanical, and morphological behavior."
1,Experimental procedure,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Raw bamboo (RB) was obtained from a forest in Kota Samarahan, Sarawak, Malaysia. The samples were then conditioned and dried in a forced air conversion heater for five days at 70 °C. Analytical grade chemicals that include polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (99% purity, Sigma-Aldrich, USA), sodium hydroxide (Merck Schuchardt, Germany), ethanol (95% purity, HmbG, Germany), and nanoclay (Cloisite, BYK, USA) were used. Benzoyl peroxide was used as catalyst and ethanol was employed to dissolve the radicals while Sodium hydroxide was used to enhance polymerization due to its adjustment of the pH of the medium."
3,Sample preparation,"2.2 Sample preparation A solution was prepared by adding a different quantity of montmorillonite nanoclay and sodium hydroxide and PVA, which are dissolved in 500 ml ethanol. Benzoyl peroxide was added to act as a catalyst. The oven dried bamboo strips were then immersed in the solution. Both the bamboo and the solution were transferred into a vacuum chamber at varying duration for impregnation. The impregnated specimens were placed in an oven for polymerization, cross-linkage, and curing for 24 h at 80 °C to obtain the bamboo nanocomposites."
4,Design of experiment,"2.3 Design of experiment Design of experiment software Design Expert® 11 used in the design matrix and analysis of the experimental data. The parameters used are clay loading, PVA, NaOH, and time as input data at 2-level factorial shown in Table 1 . From the design of the experiment, 16 runs of experiments were carried, as shown in Table 2 . The experiment was randomly conducted to minimize experimental errors. The relationship between the independent variables Clay loading, PVA, NaOH and Time (A, B, C, and D respectively) and the response y was fitted to a polynomial model of 4 factorial as expressed in equation one below: (1) y = β o + β 1 A + β 2 B + β 3 C + β 4 D + β 12 A B + β 11 A 2 + β 22 B 2 + β 33 C 2 + β 44 D 2 + β 13 A C + β 14 A D + β 23 B C + β 24 B D + β 34 C D + β 123 A B C + β 142 A D B + β 134 A C D + β 234 B C D + β 1234 A B C D where y is the response, β 0 is the constant term, and β i , βij, and β i j k is the coefficients of the polynomial-linear effects, quadratic effects, and interaction effects. To ensure repeatability and reproducibility, a minimum of 5 measurements each was repeated within the tolerance range that adequately represent variation in the processes. The sequence of measurement was randomized to avoid bias in the evaluation. Range-average method proposed by Connett [43] was employed in determining the repeatability and selecting the experimental data used in developing the models."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization From the result of the optimization and test with a higher modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR), some samples presented in Table 3 were characterized and compared with the raw sample to study the effects of the modification. 2.4.1 Three-point bending test This test was carried out with Universal Testing Machine Shimadzu MSC-5/500 (Kyoto, Japan) operated at a speed of 5 mm/min. The specimens were prepared in the dimension of 300 mm (L) x 20 mm (T) x 20 mm (W). The MOE and MOR for RB and the nanocomposites samples were then calculated as described by Ref. [44]. 2.4.2 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) The FTIR spectra recordings of samples were done using Shimadzu IR Affinity-1 Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu; Kyoto, Japan). The range of the wavenumber used was 4000 to 600 cm−1. 2.4.3 X-ray diffraction (XRD) XRD was carried out by Bruker D8 advanced X-ray diffractometer (Bruker Optik GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany) with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å, rated as 1.6 kW) for microstructural analysis. 2.4.4 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) SEM was done using a Hitachi TM3030 supplied by JEOL (Tokyo, Japan) with a voltage of 20 kV in a vacuum. The surfaces of the samples were gold coated and imaged. 2.4.5 Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) DSC Q10 (TA instrument) thermal system with the use of a sealed aluminum capsule was employed for differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. Each data represented a mean of five repeated runs. The specimen was weighed to about 4–4.5 mg and held at a single heating rate of 10 °C/min and scanning temperature from 30 to 450 °C. The crystallization and melting temperatures of the samples were obtained. 2.4.6 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) TGA measurements were done with a PerkinElmer Pyris1 TGA system. Analyses were done at nitrogen flow rate of 20 mL min−1 starting 50 and 600 °C, oxygen flow rate of 20 mL min−1 between 600 and 700 °C. Heating rate of 20 °C min−1 was maintained, this was adopted from study by Saiful Islam et al. [45]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Analysis of variance (ANOVA) on effect on MOE and MOR,"3.1 Analysis of variance (ANOVA) on effect on MOE and MOR ANOVA was performed to investigate the effect of the modification parameters on MOE and MOR and draw a conclusion from the analysis of the experimental data. P values less than 0.05 indicate how significant a parameter is to the model. From Table 4 above, all the P values are less than 0.05. In this case, A, C, D, BC, BD, ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD, and ABCD are significant model terms. The R2 of 0.9999 achieved is indicative that the model produced is valid and closely fitted to the experimental data. This result is similar to one reported by Chieng et al. [46] The predicted R2 of 0.9698 is in reasonable agreement with the adjusted R2 of 0.9982. The difference between predicted R2 and adjusted R2 was found to be 0.03, which is within the required limit (not more than 0.2) for a good model. R2 can improve by addition of more independent variables therefore goodness of fit cannot be concluded from value of R2 alone. Conversely adjusted R2 only increases with variables that have strong correlation with the dependent variable otherwise it decreases. On the other hand, predicted R2 is an indication of how well the model developed produces responses for new observation and weather the model is complicated or not. Therefore, adjusted R2 and predicted R2 are more desirable properties for goodness of fit in statistics. In this study, all the R2 properties are close to 1, thus the data and the models produced were very significant (see Table 5). Equations (2) and (3) were modelled using the analysis and based on coded factors of +1 for high level and −1 for both MOE and MOR as follows: (2) M O E = 13.65 + 0.5156 A − 1.56 C + 0.4781 D + 0.3244 A B + 0.2531 A C − 0.2219 A D + 0.5419 B C − 0.8631 B D − 0.1744 C D − 0.9656 A B C − 0.6556 A D B + 0.6056 A C D + 0.6169 B C D + 0.6094 A B C D (3) M O R = 13.65 + 2.53 A + 1.49 B − 8.78 C − 4.21 D − 3.20 A B + 2.52 A C − 6.47 A D − 4.16 B C − 4.07 B D + 1.24 C D + 1.29 A B C − 4.65 B C D − 1.950 A B C D The two models were used in evaluating the predicted values in Table 4 above. It was observed that the experimental and the values obtained are very close, with low residuals. Fig. 1 showed a straight line fit on the actual versus residual plot. This agreed with results reported by Sharifi et al. [47]."
8,Prediction of optimal conditions,"3.2 Prediction of optimal conditions The optimization goals set were to minimize the use of nanoclay, PVA, modification time, and sodium hydroxide in order to maximize MOE and MOR. From Fig. 2 , the optimal value of MOE is 15.082 GPa at a clay loading of 5 wt%, PVA value of 1 wt% in 15 min without NaOH.Similarly, an optimized MOR value of 96.879 MPa was obtained at the same modification conditions and is presented in Fig. 3 below. Optimized values help to determine the parameters that save cost and time in achieving the modification objective. Increasing addition of components or modification time beyond these values can result in additional cost with less or non-profitability."
9,Compositional analysis,"3.3 Compositional analysis FTIR analysis: Spectra of some selected nanocomposites and RB are presented in Fig. 4 . The absorption bands observed in the range of 4000–500 cm−1 were assigned to various constituents. In both RB and the nanocomposites, the Si–O and Al–OH main functional groups were observed at the 1000 cm−1 and 500 cm−1 range. Peak intensities at 667.37 to 522.7 cm−1 and 1043.49 to 1029.99 cm−1 were due to the stretching vibrations of Al–O–Si of the clay and out-of-plane bending vibrations of OH groups of the bamboo [48–51]. Therefore, the nanocomposites intensity band was higher than that of the RB due to the bending vibrations of alumina-silica bond. The peaks at 4000 cm−1 to 2900 cm−1 is corresponding to vibration of hydrogen bond and that of the OH group. The stretching of carbon-hydrogen in polyvinyl occurred at 3000 cm−1 to 2900 cm−1 [52]. The Peaks at 1251.8 to 1259.52 cm−1 may be due to the increased amount of aromatic double bonds of PVA. The spectra of the nanocomposites showed decrease in peak intensity above 2900 cm−1 indicating OH group. The nanoclay displaced the voids occupied by the water content of the bamboo matrix as it plasticized within the bamboo lumens [44]. Indications of impregnation of nanoclay were evident in peak intensities at 3425.58 to 3126.61 cm−1, 1049.28 to 1029 0.99 cm−1 and 667.37 to 522.7 cm−1 which is in agreement with similar findings [53,54]. XRD analysis: The X-ray diffractograms for the different samples which are presented in Fig. 5 which highlighted the compositional change from RB to the nanocomposites. The RB was characterized by a peak at 2θ = 22.23° and d spacing 3.82 A° according to Bragg's law, showing non-intercalated bamboo. However, the presence of the peaks at 2θ = 43.6°, 51.1° and 72.6° which corresponds d spacing 2.07 A°, 1.79 A° and 1.30 A°, indicated that the nanocomposites have changed in compositional arrangement due to intercalation of the PVA and clay dispersion into the bamboo matrix. Similar results were reported by Xu et al. [55]. The change in the d spacing was due to the penetration of the polymer molecules and clay into the bamboo matrix."
10,Morphological analysis,"3.4 Morphological analysis The SEM images of the RB and the nanocomposites are presented in Fig. 6 . It is very clear from Fig. 5a that RB has pores that normally get occupied by water and air. The tracheids, and lumens of the bamboo was occupied by the PVA and nanoclay via polymerization of the polymer and dispersion of the clay. Fig. 5b-5fc, showed good dispersion into the pores of the bamboo matrix, while the PVA might have formed covalent bonds with the bamboo fiber walls in the nanocomposite [56]. The improved interaction between the clay filler and bamboo brought about a rigid composite and resulted to improved mechanical properties of the nanocomposites [57]."
11,Thermal properties,"3.5 Thermal properties The observed DSC curves of the RB and the nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 7 . Three distinctly separate endothermic Peaks at 78 °C to 114 °C, 180 °C to 222 °C, and 330 °C to 396 °C which corresponds to amorphous, para-crystalline and crystalline phases respectively were exhibited by the RB [58,59]. Higher susceptibility to heat and chemicals was observed in the amorphous and para-crystalline components compared to the crystalline components of the sample. Thus, the higher molecular movement was observed in the non-crystalline phase compared to the crystalline part. A rigid motion of the chain macromolecules was observed with the change in movement ascribed to intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonding [60]. Removal of absorbed water from RB and the nanocomposites was indicated by the first endothermic peak, where the peak area of the nanocomposite was found to be lower than that of RB due to the reduction of water and restriction of the amorphous movement by the filler in the nanocomposites [61]. The resulting higher evaporation water of the RB compared to nanocomposites was an indication of the water being more tightly held due to the ionic characteristics of the nanoclay in the formed nanocomposites. The similarity was observed in the thermal stability of the second endothermic para-crystalline phase of the composites, but the para-crystalline enthalpy of raw bamboo was higher than that of the nanocomposites. However, the para-crystalline endothermic enthalpy of the nanocomposites was lower than that of raw bamboo due to an interaction of PVA and clay tending towards the conversion of the para-crystalline region of bamboo to the crystalline region [62]. It can be inferred that the nanocomposites absorbed more heat compared to the RB due to higher crystallinity observed in the composites. The thermal degradation of the RB and that of the nanocomposites was done by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to study the profiles of the degradation of different types of the nanocomposites, which are shown in Fig. 8 . Different stages of thermal decomposition and degradation were exhibited by the raw and treated bamboo samples. Loss of weight in all samples which occurred at the first stage of 73 °C to 112 °C and was found to be highest in RB which was attributed to the amount of absorbed moisture similar [63]. At temperatures below 112 °C, the initial weight loss was lowest for PVA4, followed by PVA1, PVA2, PVA4 then PVA3 with the difference in losses attributed to the hydrolyzed reaction with the OH group of the bamboo wall and the clay that also filled the cavities of the nanocomposites samples. The second stage of thermal decomposition in the samples occurred at temperatures of 252 °C. with an appreciably lesser weight loss in the nanocomposites compared to RB with the difference in weight loss attributed to the strong covalent bonds in the treated bamboo. Similarly, an appreciable difference was observed between the RB and the nanocomposites in the third stage of thermal decomposition which occurred at 383 °C. The lesser loss in the nanocomposites was attributed to the decomposition of less volatile products replaced by well-distributed clay layers throughout the composites [64,65]."
12,Conclusions,"In this study, successful impregnation of bamboo with closite Na+ nanoclay and PVA was established by FT-IR, XRD, SEM, TGA, and DSC analyses. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) resulted in a model that predicted values close to experimental values in determining the MOE and MOR. Optimum values of MOE 15.082 GPa and MOR 96.879 and corresponding modification parameter of clay loading of 5 wt%, PVA value of 1 wt% in 15 min and neutral pH. The OH group of the RB, which was responsible for water absorption decreased after dispersion of nanoclay and polymerization of PVA as indicated by FTIR spectra. The XRD result revealed changes in the crystallinity of the RB and compared to the formed nanocomposites as evident in the shift of brag angles and the corresponding d spacings. The morphology of the nanocomposites showed excellent dispersion, smooth surfaces, strong interfacial bonding, and reduced void spaces compared to RB as shown in the SEM images. These have therefore led to improved mechanical properties. The nanoclay layers dispersed on a nanoscale in the polymer matrix and acted as the reinforcing filler, thereby resulting in improved thermal stability of the developed nanocomposite as indicated by DSC and TGA results."
