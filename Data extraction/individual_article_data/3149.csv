0,Introduction,"Currently, pollutions and environmental problems are the most important challenges facing human life around the globe. Thus, finding and developing a clean source of energy supply can significantly lead to a reduction of emission of harmful substances into the environment. In this regard, generation of electrical energy by proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) can be used as an environmental friendly source of energy because of their low contamination (water is the only exhaust product of PEMFCs) [1,2]. PEMFCs require pure hydrogen gas as fuel to produce energy. Due to serious storage and transportation safety problems of hydrogen, this gas can be produced on-board in the form of simple alcohols and hydrocarbon reforming process for fuel cell applications [3,4]. Although among all alcohols and hydrocarbons, methane is utilized for industrial production of hydrogen. However, methanol as simple alcohol can be extensively used to produce hydrogen compared with other liquid fuels, for several reasons such as the existence of single carbon atom in the structure thus minimizing coke formation, lowering reforming temperature and high hydrogen-to-carbon ratio (4:1). In addition, methanol is sulphur free and can be extracted from renewable resources [5–7]. Methanol reforming for the production of hydrogen can be performed by four different processes: decomposition of methanol (MD), partial oxidation of methanol (POM), methanol steam reforming (MSR) and oxidative steam reforming of methanol (OSRM). Among these 4 processes, steam reforming of methanol has the highest yield of hydrogen generation and the lowest production of carbon monoxide [8,9]. In the methanol reforming process, in addition to main reforming reaction Eq. (1) in the presence of steam, methanol decomposition, Eq. (2) and water gas shift reaction, Eq. (3) also take place [10,11]: (1) CH 3 OH + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + 3 H 2 Δ H = 49.7 kJ / mol (2) CH 3 OH ↔ CO + 2 H 2 Δ H = 90.2 kJ / mol (3) CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 Δ H = - 41.2 kJ / mol As mentioned, the main objective of methanol steam reforming is the production of pure hydrogen as fuel for PEMFCs. Hence, the amount of side products particularly carbon monoxide must be very minimal in the order of a few ppms due to its very bad effects on the Pt catalyst of the fuel cells. The main destructive effect of carbon monoxide is the poisoning of the surface of the Pt catalyst, caused by the irreversible chemisorption of CO on Pt, which in turns lead to a considerable decrease of the catalyst’s activity toward hydrogen oxidation reaction. Methanol steam reforming reaction catalysts, must be very active in order to increase the conversion of methanol particularly at low temperatures, since at these temperatures exothermic water gas shift reaction, Eq. (3), progresses toward CO2 and H2 and in this way, CO is consumed and not generated. These catalysts also must be very selective in order to produce small amount of carbon monoxide particularly at high temperatures, and finally should be stable for a long time [12,13]. In this regard, at temperature ranges from 200 to 220°C the complete conversion of methanol and the carbon monoxide selectivity lower than 0.5%, have not been reported in previous works. Copper based and group 8–10 metals based are the two major groups of catalysts that have been extensively used for methanol steam reforming. Copper based catalysts have higher activity toward conversion of methanol, better selectivity toward H2 and CO2, and lower price compared to catalysts based on group 8–10 metals. However, thermal stability of this group is very low and so, they are easily deactivated by thermal sintering. Group 8–10 metals based catalysts have lower activity, same selectivity and higher price compared with copper based catalysts but have higher thermal stability. Comparison of characteristics of these two major groups of catalysts, signifies that copper based catalysts have better performance than the other group in methanol steam reforming reaction and thus, copper based catalysts are frequently employed in methanol steam reforming process. Copper based catalysts usually contain some metal oxides. Group of catalysts with copper, zinc and aluminium oxides briefly known as CZA (CuO-ZnO-Al2O3) are the most common catalysts for methanol steam reforming reaction. The catalysts having high copper content, generally present high activity and selectivity [14,15]. The performance of copper based catalysts can be modified to increase the conversion of methanol for the production of much hydrogen and little carbon monoxide by adding some promoters or applying different preparation methods [16,17]. The addition of ZnO, Al2O3, ZrO2 and CeO2 metal oxides can enhance the dispersion of copper active phase and specific surface area of the catalyst. Improvement in the morphology and structure of the catalyst such as more homogeneous particle size distribution, more uniform distribution of isomorph particles, more narrow size distribution of particles, smaller particles size and lower agglomeration of particles are some of the promoting effects of ZnO [18–20]. Alumina has high surface area and is used as support to provide incumbent area for suitable dispersion of copper active phase. Although MSR reaction is weakened by using Al2O3, suitable amount of it, is necessary to obtain good surface area and mechanical stability of the catalysts [21,22]. Some of the most important promoting effects of ZrO2 are prevention of sintering of copper particles, improvement of copper dispersion on the surface of the catalyst and decrease in the copper crystallite size [23,24]. Ceria can be used as promoter for amending copper dispersion on the catalyst and increasing surface area and stability of the catalyst. In addition, generation of coke and carbon monoxide decrease because of the redox properties of ceria [25,26]. As mentioned above, in addition to the role of promoters, changing preparation method can have some effects on the characteristics and performance of the catalysts [27]. There are several conventional preparation methods such as co-precipitation [22], sol-gel [28], impregnation [29], homogeneous precipitation [30] for the synthesis of methanol steam reforming catalysts. In this research, we use novel oxalate gel co-precipitation method to synthesize series of CuO-ZnO-Al2O3-ZrO2-CeO2 (CZAZC) catalysts with different amount of ZrO2 and CeO2. This new procedure for the synthesis of such catalysts, has not been reported in literature. In this method, alcoholic solution of oxalic acid dihydrate is added dropwise to alcoholic solution of precursors to form suspension solution of precipitated mixed oxalate salts of precursors. After evaporation of excess ethanol from the suspension, a gel like mixture will be formed. Isomorphous replacement between copper and zinc can be occurred in the mixed oxalate gel-precursors. This can lead to easier incorporation of zinc species into copper oxalate precursors and thus, the synthesized catalysts will have high metallic copper surface area and strong interaction between copper and zinc [31,32]. After drying and calcination process, prepared nanocatalysts via novel oxalate gel co-precipitation method, are used in methanol steam reforming reaction. Very good performance of these catalysts such as high methanol conversion at low temperatures and the production of small amount of carbon monoxide in comparison to the performance of the other catalysts in previous works, can be related to the properties that have been mentioned above. Therefore, in the present study, a series of CuO-ZnO-Al2O3-ZrO2-CeO2 nanocatalysts with different amounts of zirconia and ceria loading, were prepared by the novel oxalate gel coprecipitation synthesis method for the first time and characterized using various techniques. The effects of different amounts of zirconia and ceria loading on the structural and textural features and also on the performance of the prepared nanocatalysts by the novel method in the methanol steam reforming reaction were investigated in this study. In this way, the appropriate amounts of zirconia and ceria loading were specified. XRD, FESEM, PSD, EDX spectra and dot-mapping, BET and FTIR techniques, were employed for analysing the physicochemical characterization of prepared nanocatalysts."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials In this research, analytical grade of copper nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O), aluminium nitrate nonahydrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O), zirconium oxynitrate hexahydrate (ZrO(NO3)2·6H2O) and cerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O) were used as precursors for copper, zinc, aluminium, zirconium and cerium respectively. Oxalic acid dihydrate (HO2CCO2H·2H2O) was used as precipitation and gelation agent and finally ethanol was used as solvent for preparation of alcoholic solution of precursors and oxalic acid dihydrate. Likewise, methanol was applied as feed for steam reforming process. All materials were purchased from Merck Company except (ZrO(NO3)2·6H2O) that was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich."
3,Nanocatalysts preparation procedure,"2.2 Nanocatalysts preparation procedure Schematic processing steps for preparation of ZrO2-CeO2-promoted CuO-ZnO-Al2O3 nanocatalysts are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 . As seen in the flowchart, novel oxalate gel coprecipitation synthesis method consists of three stages. At the first stage, a 1M solution of appropriate amounts of hydrous metal nitrate precursors in ethanol was made for synthesis of CuO-ZnO-Al2O3-ZrO2-CeO2 nanocatalysts with different value of zirconia and ceria. Respective metal oxides weight percent of five nanocatalysts have been shown by (45–30–5–20–0), (45–30–5–15–5), (45–30–5–10–10), (45–30–5–5–15) and (45–30–5–0–20). A 1Molal solution of oxalic acid dihydrate in ethanol was also made at the first stage. In the next step of the first stage, while mixture of precursors has been placed into water ice bath at 0°C, 1Molal solution of oxalic acid dihydrate was added dropwise to 1M solution of precursors under continuous stirring, until a suspension was obtained. In the second stage, the obtained suspension was heated up to 70°C in order to evaporate extra ethanol and in this way, gel like mixture of oxalate salt of various precursors was formed. In the final stage, post treatment process was carried out in three steps. Firstly the resulted gel like mixture was dried at 110°C for 12h under air flow. Along drying process, the gel exhibited considerable volume of shrinkage. At the next step, programmed calcination for nanocatalysts powder was performed in the muffle furnace under air atmosphere. In this way, the temperature was kept constant for 1h at 150°C, 200°C, 250°C, 300°C and finally 4h at 350°C. The constant heating ramp (5°C/min) was used for progressive temperature increase between each step. Also, the constant cooling ramp (10°C/min) was applied in order to cooling down the furnace after calcination process. In the final step, obtained nanocatalysts powder, were shaped as small cylindrical particles by the help of Plexiglas reticulated plate, for preparation to be use in methanol steam reforming reaction. The fabricated nanocatalysts were represented as CZAZ20, CZAZ15C5, CZAZ10C10, CZAZ5C15, and CZAC20 respectively."
4,Nanocatalysts characterization techniques,"2.3 Nanocatalysts characterization techniques Crystallography and XRD diffraction patterns of prepared nanocatalysts were obtained by D-5000 Siemens X-ray diffractometer. This instrument included CuKα radiation source (λ=0.154056nm) with X-ray tube that worked at 30kV and 40mA. The existence of crystallite phases of metal oxides and other compounds were shown by comparison of obtained XRD patterns with standard diffraction peaks of compounds in Joint Committee of Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS). Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) technique that was conducted on a HITACHI S-4160 analyzer was used to determine surficial morphology and particle size distribution of samples. Surficial elemental features of fabricated nanocatalysts were obtained with the help of EDX analysis that was implemented by VEGA II, TESCAN, Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyzer. Specific surface area measurement was done by a Quantachrome ChemBET 3000 analyzer with N2 gas adsorption technique and calculations were performed by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation. Functional groups detection was performed with Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy analysis through Unicam 4000 FTIR spectrometer in the range of 400–4000cm−1 by using KBr plate."
5,Experimental setup for catalytic performance test,"2.4 Experimental setup for catalytic performance test Experimental setup for testing the performance of catalysts in methanol steam reforming process is illustrated in Fig. 3 . The MSR (methanol steam reforming) reaction was accomplished in the fixed bed U-shape Pyrex reactor (5mm i.d.). The reactor was located in the programmable furnace in order to provide different reaction temperatures in the range of 160–240°C. The amount of pre-shaped catalyst loading in the reactor for each batch was 400mg. Prior to the commencement of MSR reaction, catalysts were reduced in the H2/Ar 15% (volume percent) gas stream with 100cm3/min volumetric flow rate for 3h at 300°C. Mixture of liquid methanol and water in the ratio of 1:4 in the saturator has been used as feed. The saturator was placed in a water ice bath at 0°C in order to prevent methanol vaporization. A stream of Argon gas as a carrier gas was entered into the saturator and conveyed vapor of methanol and water to the second saturator which was empty in order to homogeneity of the feed stream. After that, the second saturator outlet gas stream was arrived to the catalytic bed reactor. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was fixed at 10,000cm3/gcat h. So, the volumetric flow rate of the Argon carrier gas was set on 66.7cm3/min by a mass flow controller (MFC) in the line of Argon stream. After the reaction, the outlet gas from the reactor was injected into gas chromatography (GC Chrom, Teif Gostar Faraz, Iran) in order to analyze the content of unreacted methanol and value of produced hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide gases. PLOT-U column was employed in gas chromatography (GC) apparatus to separate different gas from each other. TCD and FID detectors were used in GC, for detecting each gas. TCD detected hydrogen gas and FID with the help of methanizer reactor, detected carbon consisting compounds even with very low concentration. The following relations were used to calculate the value of methanol conversion and selectivity of products: (4) X CH 3 OH % = F CH 3 OH in - F CH 3 OH out F CH 3 OH in × 100 (5) S H 2 % = F H 2 out F H 2 out + F CO out + F CO 2 out × 100 (6) S CO % = F CO out F H 2 out + F CO out + F CO 2 out × 100 (7) S CO 2 % = F CO 2 out F H 2 out + F CO out + F CO 2 out × 100 where Fi and Si are flow rate and selectivity of component i in the reactor outlet gas respectively."
6,Results and discussions,
7,Nanocatalysts characterization,"3.1 Nanocatalysts characterization 3.1.1 XRD analysis The XRD diffraction patterns of synthesized ZrO2-CeO2-promoted CuO-ZnO-Al2O3 nanocatalysts at 2θ=20–90° is illustrated in Fig. 4 . Generally, low intensity and broad peaks for samples synthesized by novel oxalate gel co-precipitation method, are observed in XRD patterns. This can be interpreted by high dispersion and low crystallite size of metal oxides [32,33]. Furthermore, as previously mentioned, isomorphous replacement between zinc and copper species occurs in the mixed oxalate gel of precursors and thus, easier incorporation of zinc species into copper oxalate precursors can be performed. As a consequence, amorphous-like or less well-ordered structures are anticipated for prepared catalysts [32,34]. The strong diffraction peaks at 2θ=35.6, 38.8, 48.8 and 68.2° are assigned to monoclinic phase of CuO (JCPDS 01-080-1268), that these diffraction peaks are related to (−111), (111), (−202) and (220) crystallite planes, respectively. Also, the significant diffraction peaks at 2θ=31.7, 34.4, 36.2 and 56.5° are assigned to hexagonal phase of ZnO (JCPDS 01-076-0704), that are related to (100), (002), (101) and (110) crystallite facets, respectively. According to the theoretical and experimental information obtained from MSR reaction mechanism, that has been stated in literature, Cu (111) is the most active copper crystallite plate to adsorb methanol and several other intermediates [35]. The comparative study of the XRD patterns signifies that by the addition of ceria to CZAZ20 sample which has no content of CeO2, the intensity of CuO diffraction peak at 2θ=38.8° is decreased slightly in sample CZAZ15C5 in comparison with CZAZ20, and after that by simultaneous increase in ceria and decrease in zirconia loading for all the other samples, there was a gradually slight increase in the intensity of CuO diffraction peak at 2θ=38.8° which is related to (111) crystallite plate, but the width of this diffraction peak is reduced slightly. These observations demonstrate that, crystallinity and crystallite size of CuO (111) plate in different samples are increased by simultaneous change in ceria and zirconia loading. As a result, uniform dispersion of copper oxide crystallites can be reduced and this may lead to adverse effects on the performance of the catalysts in MSR reaction. Alongside CuO facets, ZnO crystallite plates also have significant role in methanol steam reforming reaction. ZnO plates can adsorb both methanol and water, and in this regard water can be adsorbed dissociatively and molecularly on ZnO (002) and (100) crystallite plates, respectively. In Addition, ZnO facets can also adsorb CO2 and CO, but adsorption of CO2 is much stronger than CO and thus, it shows that the selectivity of ZnO toward carbon dioxide is more than that of carbon monoxide [36,37]. The XRD patterns also denote that with the addition of CeO2 loading to nanocatalysts, the intensity of ZnO diffraction peak at 2θ=31.7° is weakened and thus, the dispersion of ZnO (100) crystallite facet can be enhanced. The trend of strong diffraction peaks at 2θ=28.7 and 47.7° that are assigned to cubic phase of CeO2 (JCPDS 01-075-0076), shows meliorating crystallinity of CeO2 by increasing ceria loading. No other diffraction peak can be seen for ZrO2, except very weak peak in CZAZ20 and CZAZ15C5 samples for zirconia at 2θ=30.3°, which is related to tetragonal phase of ZrO2 (JCPDS 01-080-0784). Strong diffraction peak for Al2O3 is not also seen in XRD patterns. This may be due to the reasons such as low loading, high dispersion, or amorphous phase of ZrO2 and Al2O3 as a consequence of low calcination temperature. Also, there are no detectable peaks for ZnAl2O4 and CuAl2O4 spinels in XRD patterns, since these composites are formed in calcination temperatures above 500°C. The XRD diffraction patterns establish peaks overlapping at different 2θ for CuO and ZnO. For instance the CuO peak at 2θ=35.6° and ZnO peak at 2θ=36.2° both have overlap. 3.1.2 FESEM analysis Fig. 5 depicts FESEM images of synthesized ZrO2-CeO2-Promoted CuO-ZnO-Al2O3 nanocatalysts. These images reveal surficial morphology and structure, and also give approximate evaluation of particle size distribution for different samples. The catalysts possessing some particular features such as more homogeneous particle size distribution, more uniform distribution of isomorph particles, more narrow size distribution of particles, smaller particles size and lower agglomeration of particles, exhibit desirable surficial morphology to have good performance in every catalytic reaction. Improving surficial morphology can facilitate the achievement of reactants to metal active phases and this offers conditions to perform reactions in the way of higher methanol conversion and better selectivity toward preferable products. It is intelligible from images that size of particles in all catalysts is in nanometric scale. Nanocatalysts are more reactive and reducible, and therefore, have high catalytic performance. It can be observed from FESEM images that the structure, particle size, and morphology of the nanocatalysts, varied regularly by tuning the loadings of ceria and zirconia. It is evident that simultaneous increase in ceria and decrease in zirconia loading, lead to more uniform distribution of isomorph particles on the surface of nanocatalysts. Similarly, with these changes in loading of promoters, the size of particles becomes smaller and agglomeration of particles is reduced. However, FESEM images show that CZAZ10C10 has the best surficial morphology among all samples, due to the absence of agglomerated particles and more uniform distribution of particles, but the morphology of CZAZ5C15 and CZAC20 nanocatalysts containing more ceria, are not as good as CZAZ10C10. Thus, increasing ceria loading until 10wt.% can significantly improve surficial morphology of nanocatalysts and this is optimum weight percent for ceria. This indicates that the use of ceria and zirconia with equal weight percent in the preparation of nanocatalysts can result in synergic interaction between this two as well as other compounds and very good effects on surficial morphology of the nanocatalysts. Additionally, FESEM images of CZAC20 show better morphology and particle size distribution in comparison with CZAZ20, CZAZ15C5 and CZAZ5C15 nanocatalysts, but surficial features of this nanocatalyst are not as good as CZAZ10C10 sample. As cited above, there is a relationship between morphological features and activity of the nanocatalysts. Hence, desirable morphological properties as well as higher specific surface area facilitate the achieving and adsorption of reactants to metal active phases and therefore better performance and higher activity in methanol steam reforming reaction. Consequently, the best performance in methanol steam reforming and highest methanol conversion is expected for CZAZ10C10 sample. Moreover the worst performance in MSR and the lowest methanol conversion is predictable for CZAZ5C15, because of the worst surficial morphology of this sample due to large particle size and existence of agglomerated particles. Furthermore, due to better surficial morphology, the performance of CZAC20 in MSR can be better than CZAZ20, CZAZ15C5 and CZAZ5C15. Surface particle size histogram of CZAZ10C10 nanocatalyst is shown in Fig. 6 . Statistical distribution and average particle size are determined by ImageJ software. The quantitative assessment of surface particle size in CZAZ10C10 indicates that all particles have size of less than 100nm. The minimum, maximum and average particle size of CZAZ10C10 are 11.8, 62.2 and 24.9nm, respectively. More than half of the particles (53.5%) are in the size range of 20–30nm. 3.1.3 EDX analysis EDX spectra and dot-mapping surficial analysis for five ZrO2-CeO2-promoted CuO-ZnO-Al2O3 synthesized nanocatalysts are illustrated in Fig. 7 . According to XRD analysis, the diffraction peaks for some compounds that have been used for synthesis of nanocatalysts, such as alumina and in some samples zirconia, were not seen in the XRD patterns, and in these cases the existence of all compounds and elements are confirmed by EDX spectra and dot-mapping micrographs. EDX dot-mapping micrographs are employed for demonstrating uniform dispersion and absence of sintering and agglomeration of particles in the samples. Surficial chemical analysis as well as surficial elemental weight percent of fabricated nanocatalysts, are also obtained by the use of EDX analysis. It is obvious from EDX dot-mapping that CZAZ10C10 has the best surficial dispersion and most uniform distribution of elements among all the samples, and this may be due to synergic effect between equal weight percent of ceria and zirconia as well as other compounds. Also it can be observed from EDX dot-mapping of CZAC20 sample, that the lack of zirconia causes adverse effect on dispersion of elements especially cerium, and so this indicates the significance of zirconia presence, to have more uniform distribution of elements. Comparison of theoretical (Gel) and practical (Cat.) surficial elemental weight percent in each sample, indicates that the amount of elements which have been used for preparing each nanocatalyst, are close to the amounts of elements that exist on the surface of each sample. Surficial practical weight percent of copper and zinc on CZAZ10C10 sample are closer, in comparison with the other nanocatalysts and this leads to an increase in interaction between CuO and ZnO. Enhancing interaction between copper oxide and zinc oxide can lead to improvement in synergic effect between this two and other metal oxides. Therefore due to very good influence of better interaction between CuO and ZnO on methanol conversion and selectivity in MSR reaction [22], this process can be improved by using this nanocatalyst in the case of increasing methanol conversion and selectivity toward desirable products. 3.1.4 BET analysis All of the reactions on heterogeneous catalysts perform in the way of adsorption of reactants on surface active phases of catalyst. In the next stage, dissociation of chemical bonds of adsorbed reactants, leads to the formation of new chemical bonds, in order to generate products of chemical reaction. Fig. 8 shows specific surface area of the synthesized nanocatalysts that are measured by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. Specific surface area is one the most important properties of the nanocatalysts, due to its vital role in providing active sites for adsorption of reactants as a start of every chemical reaction on heterogeneous catalysts. Nanocatalysts with higher specific surface area, have more active sites for adsorption of reactants. The calculated specific surface areas for CZAZ20, CZAZ15C5, CZAZ10C10, CZAZ5C15 and CZAC20 nanocatalysts are 67, 68, 72, 66 and 64m2 g−1, respectively. It is evident that specific surface areas of the samples increased with simultaneous addition of ceria loading and decreasing zirconia loading until 10wt.%, is attained equally for both. More homogeneous particle size distribution, more uniform distribution of particles, smaller particles size, more narrow size distribution of particles, absence of agglomeration of particles and finally better surficial morphology lead to higher specific surface areas. According to FESEM micrographs, CZAZ10C10 sample had the best surficial morphology and no agglomeration of particles; therefore, the highest specific surface area is expected for this nanocatalyst. In the same way, low specific surface area is expected for the nanocatalysts with unfavourable surficial morphology and some of agglomerated particles. Consequently, regarding to the calculated specific surface areas of samples which are gained along BET analysis, the results have good and appropriate consistency with findings from FESEM analysis. 3.1.5 FTIR analysis Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrums of prepared nanocatalysts are depicted in Fig. 9 . In order to acquire the exact explanation of surface functional groups, spectroscopy was performed in wide wave number range from 400 to 4000cm−1. It is evident from the spectra that all five samples have approximately similar peaks and thus, the existence of same functional groups in different samples can be concluded. The absorption peaks in the range of 400–900cm−1 can be assigned to metal oxides bonds on the catalysts [3,38,39]. In this regard, the bands at 460 and 495cm−1 are assigned to zinc and copper oxide stretching vibration respectively [40]. The peak around 700cm−1 wave number can be related to AlO bonds [2]. Also the absorption peak around 1400cm−1 can be assigned to vibration of ZrO bonds. Conversely, the vibration frequency bands around 1430, 1590, 1660 and 3450cm−1 are ascribed to the hydroxide groups that widely included hydrogen bonds [41–43]. Specifically, interlayer water molecules which may be left from various stages of synthesis procedure, can be identified by the absorption band at 1660cm−1 [44–46]. Physically adsorbed water in the nanocatalysts after heat treatment can be indicated by absorption peaks around 1430, 1590 and 3450cm−1 [47–49]. Therefore the absorption peak of ZrO bonds may have overlaps with vibration frequency bands of hydroxide groups. The CO2 which is adsorbed from atmosphere can be detected from small vibration absorption peak at 2330cm−1 [50,51]. Furthermore, stretching vibration of CH bonds which may me be remained from different steps of synthesis method, can be recognized by the absorption bands around 2830 and 2900cm−1 wave number [52]."
8,Reaction mechanism of CuO-ZnO-Al2O3-ZrO2-CeO2 nanocatalyst formation,"3.2 Reaction mechanism of CuO-ZnO-Al2O3-ZrO2-CeO2 nanocatalyst formation CuO–ZnO-Al2O3-ZrO2–CeO2 catalyst is synthesized by novel oxalate gel co-precipitation method in alcoholic solution for use in methanol steam reforming reaction. The above various metal oxides on the catalyst are produced through thermal decomposition of oxalate salt of precursors during calcination step. Formation of catalyst with explained procedure is represented by the following reactions. Hydrous salts of metal nitrate are used as primary precursors which dissolved in ethanol to produce different metal cations [3,53]: (8) Cu ( NO 3 ) 2 · 3 H 2 O ( s ) + Zn ( NO 3 ) 2 · 6 H 2 O ( s ) + Al ( NO 3 ) 3 · 9 H 2 O ( s ) + ZrO ( NO 3 ) 2 · 6 H 2 O ( s ) + Ce ( NO 3 ) 3 · 6 H 2 O ( s ) + n C 2 H 5 OH ( l ) → Cu 2 + + Zn 2 + + Al 3 + + ZrO 2 + + Ce 3 + + 12 NO 3 - + 30 H 2 O + n C 2 H 5 OH Oxalic acid dihydrate is also dissolved in ethanol to generate oxalate anions: (9) HO 2 CCO 2 H · 2 H 2 O ( s ) + n C 2 H 5 OH ( l ) → 2 H + + C 2 O 4 2 - + 2 H 2 O + n C 2 H 5 OH Oxalate salts of various precursors are produced from reaction between different metal cations and oxalate anions: (10) Cu 2 + + 2 NO 3 - + 2 H + + C 2 O 4 2 - ↔ CuC 2 O 4 ( s ) ↓ + 2 ( H + + NO 3 - ) (11) Zn 2 + + 2 NO 3 - + 2 H + + C 2 O 4 2 - ↔ ZnC 2 O 4 ( s ) ↓ + 2 ( H + + NO 3 - ) (12) Al 3 + + 3 NO 3 - + 2 H + + C 2 O 4 2 - ↔ Al 2 ( C 2 O 4 ) 3 ( s ) ↓ + 2 H + + 3 NO 3 - (13) ZrO 2 + + 2 NO 3 - + 2 H + + C 2 O 4 2 - ↔ ZrOC 2 O 4 ( s ) ↓ + 2 ( H + + NO 3 - ) (14) Ce 3 + + 3 NO 3 - + 2 H + + C 2 O 4 2 - ↔ Ce 2 ( C 2 O 4 ) 3 ( s ) ↓ + 2 H + + 3 NO 3 - Thermal dissociation of oxalate salt precursors along programmed calcination, in addition to the production of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide gases, generates metal oxides [31,54]: (15) CuC 2 O 4 ( s ) → Δ CuO ( s ) + CO ( g ) + CO 2 ( g ) (16) ZnC 2 O 4 ( s ) → Δ ZnO ( s ) + CO ( g ) + CO 2 ( g ) (17) Al 2 ( C 2 O 4 ) 3 ( s ) → Δ Al 2 O 3 ( s ) + 3 CO ( g ) + 3 CO 2 ( g ) (18) ZrOC 2 O 4 ( s ) → Δ ZrO 2 ( s ) + CO ( g ) + CO 2 ( g ) (19) Ce 2 ( C 2 O 4 ) 3 ( s ) → Δ 2 CeO 2 ( s ) + 4 CO ( g ) + 2 CO 2 ( g ) Among different products from dissociation of oxalate salt precursors, carbon monoxide is very active during calcination step particularly at high temperature. Thus, it can reduce metal oxides and participate in reactions with other oxidant. In this regard, if thermal decomposition along calcination process is performed in atmosphere containing a lot of oxygen, very active carbon monoxide can simply be oxidized and therefore, reduction of metal oxides will not occur."
9,Catalytic performance study toward methanol steam reforming,"3.3 Catalytic performance study toward methanol steam reforming 3.3.1 Methanol conversion Methanol conversion of fabricated nanocatalysts in MSR reaction at different temperatures between 160 and 240°C is presented in Fig. 10 . It can be observed that methanol conversion for all the samples attained 100% at 240°C and thus, in this temperature all of methanol is converted to hydrogen, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. As seen in the figure, all fabricated samples through novel oxalate gel coprecipitation synthesis method have high methanol conversion even at low temperatures such as 180 and 200°C so that, the conversion of methanol for CZAZ10C10 and CZAC20 samples is very close to complete conversion at 200°C. This high conversion of methanol at such low temperatures has not been reported for nanocatalysts that have been prepared with other conventional synthesis methods for MSR reaction. Table 1 shows comparative data of methanol conversion, carbon monoxide selectivity and temperature for other catalysts available in the literature, in order to demonstrate this statement. It is obvious that simultaneous decrease in zirconia and increase in ceria loading until 10wt.% equally for both, can significantly enhance MSR reaction and CZAZ10C10 has the highest methanol conversion at all different temperatures among various samples. After that, conversion of methanol is reduced by the addition of ceria loading. Thus, optimum weight percent of both zirconia and ceria for preparing nanocatalysts is 10wt.%. As mentioned according to FESEM, EDX and BET characterization analysis results, CZAZ10C10 had the best surficial morphology, uniform dispersion of elements, absence of sintering and agglomeration of particles and the highest specific surface area among samples. These properties result in better accessibility of reactants to active phases for CZAZ10C10 nanocatalyst, which can lead to higher conversion of methanol. Furthermore, as previously mentioned, better morphological features of CZAC20 such as more uniform distribution of particles, more homogeneous particles size distribution, smaller particles size, more narrow size distribution of particles and lower agglomeration of particles in comparison with CZAZ20, CZAZ15C5 and CZAZ5C15 samples can be concluded from FESEM micrographs and these properties can be the reasons for better performance of CZAC20 nanocatalyst than the other three samples in methanol conversion. Consequently, obtained results from characterization analysis and value of methanol conversion for different samples have both good and appropriate consistency. 3.3.2 Products selectivity Products selectivity for each synthesized nanocatalyst at different temperature ranges between 160 and 240°C is presented in Fig. 11 . As mentioned earlier, the main objective of methanol steam reforming reaction is the production of hydrogen gas to be used as fuel in PEMFCs. Although hydrogen is the main product of MSR reaction, but other side products especially carbon monoxide is very important due to its destructive effects on the Pt catalyst of the fuel cells. The main destructive effect of carbon monoxide is the poisoning of the surface of the Pt catalyst, caused by the irreversible chemisorption of CO on Pt, which in turns lead to a considerable decrease of the catalyst’s activity toward hydrogen oxidation reaction. Reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) reaction and direct decomposition of methanol are the two principal reactions which lead to the production of carbon monoxide in MSR reaction. Also, between these two main reactions, reverse water gas shift has more contribution in generation of CO. Water gas shift (WGS) is an exothermic reaction and consequently, RWGS reaction cannot proceed at low temperatures and CO production is very little. Thus, regarding to the above explanations, suitable nanocatalyst for MSR reaction must be very active to have high conversion of methanol particularly at low temperatures. It is apparent from Fig. 11 that for all samples at every temperature the highest amount of products is attributed to hydrogen and followed by carbon dioxide which is more than carbon monoxide. There is no content of carbon monoxide at temperatures below 220°C for all the samples. According to EDX analysis, the content of ceria on the surface of five nanocatalysts is increased with increase in value of ceria loading and consequently, decrease in the formation of carbon monoxide is expected with enhancement in ceria loading due to its redox properties. But unexpectedly, as seen in Fig. 11, increasing ceria loading only until optimum weight percent (10wt.%) in CZAZ10C10 nanocatalyst can lead to decreasing amount of produced carbon monoxide at all different temperatures. Therefore, CZAZ10C10 sample has the lowest CO formation at different temperatures among other catalysts. This can be due to non-uniform distribution of ceria in CZAZ5C15 and CZAC20 nanocatalysts that is confirmed via EDX dot-mapping micrographs. Hence, CZAZ10C10 nanocatalyst according to results of XRD, FESEM, EDX and BET analysis, has the best characterization such as the most homogeneous particle size distribution, the most uniform distribution of isomorph particles, the most narrow size distribution of particles, the smallest particles size, the lowest agglomeration of particles and finally the highest specific surface area amongst other samples and these properties lead to the highest value of methanol conversion and the lowest generation of carbon monoxide of this sample at all different temperatures. Therefore, CZAZ10C10 sample is very suitable for use as catalyst in methanol steam reforming reaction. 3.3.3 Time on stream performance As previously mentioned, CZAZ10C10 sample had the best performance in high methanol conversion and selectivity toward almost 75% hydrogen production and approximately 1% CO generation at all different temperatures among other samples, thus this catalyst is selected for time on stream performance analysis. As seen in Fig. 10, 220°C is the first temperature at which methanol conversion for CZAZ10C10 nanocatalyst has reached 100% therefore, stability test is conducted at this temperature. The results of time on stream performance experiment that have been displayed in Fig. 12 , reveal that methanol conversion of CZAZ10C10 sample is approximately fix on 100% for 300min and after that gradually decreased slightly. After bringing out the catalysts from the reactor at the end of the experiment, tangible change in the color of the catalysts, was observed. This can be due to the coke formation on the catalysts, along methanol steam reforming reaction. Coke formation on the catalyst can be one of the major reasons for a limited reduction in methanol conversion. Fig. 12 also shows that hydrogen, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide selectivity are almost constant during stability test for 1440min. Very good physicochemical properties of CZAZ10C10 sample that has been synthesized by novel oxalate gel coprecipitation method, lead to better performance of this catalyst for long term usage in MSR reaction. Table 2 shows comparative data of methanol conversion at first and after 24h on stream, for some other catalysts available in the literature."
10,Reaction mechanism of methanol steam reforming over CuO-ZnO-Al2O3-ZrO2-CeO2,"3.4 Reaction mechanism of methanol steam reforming over CuO-ZnO-Al2O3-ZrO2-CeO2 Table 3 shows proposed reaction paths for methanol steam reforming process over CuO-ZnO-Al2O3-ZrO2-CeO2 nanocatalyst. These reactions can be divided into three main categories. First group consists of the reactions which are performed on the clean surface of the nanocatalysts. The reactions in the presence of adsorbed atomic oxygen and hydroxyl groups are classified in two another groups. As a start of the reactions, water molecules are adsorbed dissociatively on the surface of nanocatalyst to produce atomic hydrogen and hydroxyl (reaction (1)). Hydroxyl group can also be dissociated to atomic hydrogen and oxygen through reaction (2). Furthermore, the oxygen on the surface can be provided by ceria or zirconia or both. The reactions which are carried out on the clean surface of the nanocatalyst can be considered as methanol decomposition reactions. Among all of these reactions, according to Zuo et al. the most desirable route for methanol decomposition is demonstrated as follows: at first, methanol is adsorbed and dehydrogenated to form methoxy and atomic hydrogen species (reaction (4)). Then methoxy is transformed to formaldehyde (reaction (7)). Formyl is generated by dehydrogenation of formaldehyde (reaction (10)) and finally dehydrogenation of formyl leads to carbon monoxide formation (reaction (29)). The mentioned reaction route for methanol decomposition can be briefly expressed by: CH3OH→CH3O→CH2O→CHO→CO [62]. The reactions which are done in the presence of adsorbed atomic oxygen on the nanocatalyst can be considered as methanol oxidation reactions. The most preferable reaction path by these reactions for methanol oxidation is explained as follows: firstly, methanol is adsorbed and reacts with atomic oxygen to produce methoxy and hydroxyl species (reaction (5)). This stage is followed by methoxy and oxygen reaction to form formaldehyde and hydroxyl (reaction (8)). At the next step, formaldehyde is transformed to dioxymethylene (reaction (12)). Then, reaction between dioxymethylene and oxygen leads to formate and hydroxyl formation (reaction (21)) and at the final stage carbon dioxide is formed by the reaction between formate and atomic oxygen through reaction (27). The above favorite reaction pathway for methanol oxidation can be briefly represented by: CH3OH→CH3O→CH2O→CH2OO→CHOO→CO2 [62]. On the other hand, the reactions which are accomplished on hydroxyl covered surface of nanocatalyst can be considered as methanol steam reforming reactions. With considering all of these reactions, the most favorable reaction pathway for methanol steam reforming reaction is described as follows: as the commencement, methanol is adsorbed and reacts with hydroxyl group to generate methoxy and water species (reaction (6)). After that, the reaction between methoxy and hydroxyl leads to formaldehyde and water formation (reaction (9)). Then, formaldehyde is transformed to hydroxymethoxy (reaction (14)) which is converted to formic acid at the next step (reaction (19)). Formate and water species are the products of the reaction between formic acid and hydroxyl group through reaction (25). Finally, formate reacts with hydroxyl and in this way carbon dioxide is generated (reaction (28)). The desirable reaction route for methanol steam reforming reaction can be briefly exhibited by: CH3OH→CH3O→CH2O→CH2OOH→CHOOH→CHOO→CO2 [62]."
11,Conclusions,"The XRD diffraction peaks denoted that the crystallinity and crystallite size of copper oxide, specifically CuO (111) crystallite plate, were increased by simultaneous addition of ceria and decreasing zirconia loading. Also it was evident from XRD patterns that crystallinity of ZnO (100) facet was changed by tuning the loadings of ceria and zirconia promoters. FESEM micrographs proved that particles in different samples were in nanometric scale and also revealed that increase of ceria loading especially until optimum weight percent significantly result in more uniform distribution of isomorph particles, smaller particle size and better surficial morphology. EDX analysis confirmed homogeneous dispersion and absence of sintering and agglomeration of particles in different samples. According to the results from BET analysis, nanocatalyst with the best surficial morphology had the highest specific surface area. Therefore, the results of BET analysis have good agreement with the findings from FESEM micrographs. Performance of prepared catalysts by novel oxalate gel coprecipitation method in methanol steam reforming reaction, displayed very good activity and selectivity in methanol conversion and low generation of carbon monoxide for all samples. Among all nanocatalysts, CZAZ10C10 sample with equal weight percent (10wt.%) of ceria and zirconia had the highest methanol conversion and the lowest CO production at all different temperatures."
