0,Introduction,"Over the last few years, the need for energy has increased exponentially, whereas the availability of fossil fuels is reducing. It is estimated that the world energy demand will continue to increase by 36% by the year 2035 [1]. The incessant use of fossil fuels in the transport and energy industries has led to increase in GHG emissions, climate change and an impending energy insecurity. Thus, the development of an environmental friendly and sustainable energy source, such as hydrogen (H2) is of the essence. Biohydrogen holds the promise for a substantial contribution, because it is a highly energy efficient, clean burning and pollution-free fuel source [2,3]. It appears particularly suitable for relatively small-scale, decentralized systems, integrated with agricultural and industrial activities or waste processing facilities [4,5]. The most widely used methods for hydrogen production are electrochemical methods like electrolysis or thermochemical methods like steam reforming. However, electrochemical and thermochemical methods are disadvantageous due to the high cost, prohibitive energy demands, utilization of fossil fuel based energy and associated GHG emissions [6]. Consequently, biological methods are preferred, because they are less energy intensive as fermentation occurs mostly at ambient temperature and pressure. Dark fermentation is preferable over bio photolysis and light fermentation because of the high production rate and yield without the need for light energy [7]. Bio photolysis and light fermentation require light energy and have low light conversion efficiency [6]. Macroalgae are alternative and sustainable sources for biohydrogen production because of their high levels of carbohydrates and low levels of lignin. Macroalgae can be cultivated in non-arable land with minimal nutritional requirements, and hence they can overcome issues regarding land use changes. Macroalgae can be considered as one of the most productive biological systems to mitigate global CO2 emissions and reduce global warming. The photosynthetic efficiency of aquatic organisms is in the range of 6–8%, compared to the 1.8–2.2% of the terrestrial biomass [8]. Compared to microalgae, macroalgae harvesting is easier because they are multicellular and possesses plant-like characteristics [9]. Thus, macroalgal biomass is a potential and untapped resource for biohydrogen production. Based on their pigmentation, macroalgae are characterized as Rhodophytae (red macroalgae), Chlorophytae (green macroalgae) and Phaeophytae (brown macroalgae) with a corresponding carbohydrate content of 25–60%, 30–60% and 30–50% of their biomass, respectively [10]. These carbohydrates are extracted as fermentable sugars by pretreatment and hydrolysis, and used as substrate for biohydrogen production. A majority of the studies reported biohydrogen production from the brown algal biomass Laminaria sp. followed by the red macroalga Gelidium. Till date, very few studies report the utilization of green macroalgal biomass for biohydrogen production. Some studies have used Ulva biomass for bioethanol production [11–13]. The polysaccharides present in green macroalgae are starch, cellulose, mannan and the sulfated polysaccharide ulvan, which upon hydrolysis yields the fermentable monosugars glucose, rhamnose, mannose, xylose, and the sugar acids uronic acid and glucuronic acid [14]. Ulva lactuca biomass can be simply pretreated by a thermal process (121 °C, 25 min) in water attained a reducing sugar yield of 386.0 mg/g biomass powder, with an ethanol yield of 7.8 g/L [13]. van der Wal et al used Ulva lactuca biomass pretreated by thermal-enzymatic process in ABE (acetone-butanol-ethanol) fermentation for butanol production. Clostridium beijerinckii effectively utilized the green macroalgal biomass sugars (glucose, rhamnose, galactose, xylose) and produced 0.35 g ABE/g sugar [15]. Similarly, Ulva lactuca biomass treated by a thermal-acid method (1% H2SO4, 125 °C, 30 min) resulted in a reducing sugar yield of 15 g/L. In ABE fermentation with Clostridium sp., a butanol titer and yield of 4 g/L and 0.29 g butanol/g sugar, respectively was obtained [16]. These studies suggested the suitability of green macroalgae based sugars for fermentation by anaerobic Clostridia, and hence can be applied for biohydrogen production as well. Park et al reported that untreated Ulva lactuca biomass produced a hydrogen yield of 126.9 mL/L in dark fermentation untreated anaerobic sludge [17]. Also, Jung et al showed that untreated green macroalgal biomass Codium fragile can attain a hydrogen yield of 3.70 ± 0.17 mL H2 /g COD in dark fermentation. Thus, to the best of our knowledge, we report for the first time, the thermal-acid pretreatment of Ulva sp. biomass and subsequent use in dark fermentation in biohydrogen production. The pure anaerobic strains Clostridium pasteurianum and Clostridium butyricum were used, because obligate anaerobic fermentation could attain higher hydrogen yields in mesophilic dark fermentation [18]. Optimization of sulfuric acid concentrations for effective biomass hydrolysis was performed, and dark fermentation was conducted both in batch and continuous mode for attaining high hydrogen productivity and yield."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Dark fermentative H2 producing bacterial strains and medium,2.1 Dark fermentative H2 producing bacterial strains and medium Dark fermentative H2-producing bacterial strains were isolated from the effluent sludge of a continuous dark fermentation bioreactor [19]. The axenic H2-producing strains used in this study are Clostridium butyricum CGS5 and Clostridium pasteurianum CH4. The 16rRNA gene sequence of these strains have been deposited in the NCBI nucleotide sequence databases under the accession numbers AY540109 (strain CGS5 and EF140981 (strain CH4) [20]. The composition of Endo medium for biohydrogen production is shown in Table 1 .
3,Feedstock - green macroalgae Ulva sp.,"2.2 Feedstock - green macroalgae Ulva sp. The macroalgal biomass of Ulva sp. was sourced commercially from a local supplier. The wet biomass thus obtained was washed with running water for 5 times to remove salts and extraneous components and dried in the oven at 50 °C until the weight remains unchanged. The dried biomass was then milled to less than 100 mesh size by a grinder. The carbohydrate, protein, lipid and ash content of the biomass was determined. Amino acid content of the macroalgal hydrolysate was measured as described previously [21]. The composition of the macroalgae biomass is shown in Table 2 . The composition and amino acid profile of macroalgal hydrolysate is shown in Table 3 and Table 4 (see Table 5 )."
4,Hydrolysis of macroalgal biomass by thermal-acid (H2SO4) pretreatment,"2.3 Hydrolysis of macroalgal biomass by thermal-acid (H2SO4) pretreatment To enhance hydrolysis efficiency and determine efficient hydrolysis conditions for macroalgae, different H2SO4 concentrations, such as 0%, 2.5%, 4%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% (v/v) were used. A one gram of dry macroalgal biomass was mixed with 10 mL dilute sulfuric acid (0 to 20% v/v) in 25 mL glass bottle. The mixture was autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min. After slowly cooling to room temperature, the macroalgae hydrolysate was neutralized with CaCO3 until pH 7 and the formed solid precipitate was removed by centrifuging several times using high-speed refrigerated centrifuge at 8000 rpm for 20 min and high-speed centrifuge at 13500 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was further filtered and analyzed by high performance chromatography (HPLC) for reducing sugar content. The supernatant of macroalgal hydrolysate was used as the substrate for biohydrogen fermentation."
5,Fermentation conditions,"2.4 Fermentation conditions Each experiment started from the stock culture of Clostridium sp. which was transferred to fresh pre-culture medium. Stock culture and pre culture was grown with Endo medium with added casamino acid (2 g/L) and yeast extract (2 g/L), and sucrose (17.8 g/L) as carbon source. The bacteria were cultivated anaerobically in batch mode at 37 °C, agitation rate 200 rpm, and the initial pH of medium was adjusted to 7.5 using 5 N HCl. Argon was used to achieve and maintain anaerobic conditions. Batch fermentation was carried out by static incubation in sealed serum bottles. The fermentation variables for optimization of H2 production include macroalgae hydrolysate concentration (3, 6, 9, 12 g RS/L), pH control (6.0, 5.5, 5.0) in batch fermentation, and the operated hydraulic retention time/HRT = 4, 6, 8 h in continuous fermentation. The optimum macroalgae hydrolysate concentration was used to investigate the performance of pH control, while these optimum results were used to investigate the performance of CSTR system. During fermentation, cell concentration, pH, reducing sugar, H2 production and soluble metabolites were monitored with respect to culture time. H R T = V F o where V is the working volume of the culture (mL) and Fo is the volumetric feeding rate of the medium (mL/h)."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods 2.5.1 Determination of gas products by gas chromatography (GC) The gas products (H2) were analyzed by gas chromatography (Model 9800, China Chromatography, Taipei, Taiwan) using a thermal conductivity detector. The carrier gas for GC analysis was argon and the column (2.159 mm in inner diameter and 4 m in height) (Shing-Der et al., 2007) was packed with Porapax Q (China Chromatography, Taipei, Taiwan). The operation conditions were flow rate 20 mL/min, oven temperature 50 °C, injector temperature 120 °C, and TCD temperature 140 °C. 2.5.2 Determination of reducing sugar and soluble metabolites concentration by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) The concentration of reducing sugar and soluble metabolites (volatile fatty acids and alcohol) in the filtered (0.2 mm) supernatant of culture broth were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). For reducing sugar, HPLC equipped with refraction index detection (L-2490, Hitachi) and column NH2P-50 4E column (Shodex Asahipax, Japan) was used. The mobile phase was 70% acetonitrile in water at flow rate of 1 mL/min and column temperature was controlled at 30 °C. For soluble metabolites, HPLC equipped with a refraction index detection (RID-2414, Waters) and column ICSep ICE-COREGEL 87H3 column (Transgenomic, USA) was used. The mobile phase was 0.008 N H2SO4 at flow rate of 0.4 mL/min and column temperature was controlled at 70 °C. The injection sample volume for both HPLC was 20 μl. To prepare the sample, the fermentation broth was centrifuged at 13500 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was filtered by 0.22 µm membrane. The concentration of reducing sugar and soluble metabolites (volatile fatty acid and alcohol) were calculated by the standard calibration curve. 2.5.3 Measurement of hydrogen yield, productivity and sugar consumption The biohydrogen yield was calculated as the amount of H2 produced divided by the amount of sugar consumed during the fermentation. The biohydrogen yield (mol H2 / mol reducing sugar) was calculated using the following equations: B i o h y d r o g e n y i e l d ( m o l H 2 / m o l R S ) = m o l H 2 p r o d u c e d m o l s u g a r c o n s u m e d Biohydrogen productivity was calculated as the ratio of volume of H2 produced (mL/L) to fermentation time during the exponential growth. The biohydrogen productivity was calculated using the following equations: B i o h y d r o g e n p r o d u c t i v i t y m L / L / h = v o l u m e H 2 p r o d u c e d f e r m e n t a t i o n t i m e Reducing sugar consumption was defined as the ratio between the amounts of sugar consumed during fermentation divided by the initial sugar concentration. The sugar consumption (%) was calculated using the following equations: S u g a r c o n s u m p t i o n % = i n i t i a l R S c o n c . - r e m a i n i n g R S c o n c . i n i t i a l R S c o n c . ∗ 100 %"
7,Result and discussion,
8,Effect of acid (H2SO4) concentrations on macroalgae hydrolysis,"3.1 Effect of acid (H2SO4) concentrations on macroalgae hydrolysis Optimization of Ulva sp. hydrolysis for the release of fermentable sugars was essential for effective reducing sugar recovery and subsequent dark fermentation. A combined thermal-acid pretreatment for chosen for the pretreatment and hydrolysis of dried and powdered Ulva sp. biomass. The biomass composition of Ulva sp. is shown in Table 1. It can be seen that the high carbohydrate content makes it suitable as a renewable feedstock of reducing sugars for dark fermentative H2 production. Sivagurunathan et al showed that dilute acid pretreatment of the red macroalgal biomass with 1% H2SO4 at 121 °C for 30 min increased the maximum hydrogen production to 52 mL-H2/g-dry biomass from 27 mL-H2/g-dry biomass with only thermal pretreatment [22] Also, sulfuric acid pretreatment enhanced hydrogen production, while treatment with other acids such as hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid and nitric acid resulted in lower reducing sugar recovery and hydrogen production potential. To optimize the reducing sugar yield, various acid (H2SO4) concentration from 0 to 20% were investigated in this study and the results can be seen in Fig. 1 . Among various H2SO4 concentrations examined, best hydrolysis efficiency was obtained with 4% H2SO4. The amount of reducing sugar concentration, hydrolysis efficiency with respect to biomass hydrolysis efficiency with respect to carbohydrates, HMF concentration, and Furfural concentration were 21.1 g/L, 0.21 g RS/g biomass, 0.42 g RS/g carbohydrates, 0.55 g/L, 0.18 g/L, respectively. The inhibitors (HMF and Furfural) concentrations increased correspondingly with H2SO4 concentrations. The HMF and furfural concentrations with 2.5%, 4%, 5% and 10% H2SO4 were 0.47, 0.55, 0.66 and 0.82 g/L and 0.1, 0.18, 0.25 and 0.56 g/L, respectively. To attain optimal sugar recovery with minimal inhibitor formation, sulfuric acid concentration of 4% was chosen for further experiments of mesophilic dark fermentation using macroalgae hydrolysate."
9,Screening of H2 producing bacteria for effective H2 production using macroalgae hydrolysate,"3.2 Screening of H2 producing bacteria for effective H2 production using macroalgae hydrolysate The macroalgal biomass was hydrolyzed using 4% sulfuric acid and then the reducing sugars obtained were used as a substrate for biohydrogen fermentation. Clostridium pasteurianum CH4 and Clostridium butyricum CGS5 strains were cultivated in Endo Medium with 200 rpm agitation for mesophilic dark fermentation using macroalgae hydrolysate at a concentration of 12 g/L. The optimal conditions such as initial pH 7.5 and temperature 37 °C for this fermentation was obtained from our previous study (Lo et al., 2008). Among the two strains (CH4 and CGS5) examined, the results (Fig. 2 ) showed that strain CGS5 utilized macroalgae hydrolysate better than strain CH4. For strain CH4, the H2 production rate, H2 yield, and H2 content were 5.41 mL/L/h, 0.14 mol H2/mole RS, and 11.3%, respectively. Analysis of reducing sugar consumption indicated that CH4 strain can utilize glucose, but cannot utilize xylose and rhamnose, and thus have poor H2 production. This finding is in agreement with the literature, indicating that Clostridium pasteurianum species is unable to use xylose as the carbon source for growth [23] and the xylose utilization effieicncy of CH4 in this study was 5.14%. The capability of Clostridium pasteurianum to utilize rhamnose has not been investigated yet, and from our studies it is clear that C. pasteuranium is unable to metabolize rhamnose. A rhamnose utilization rate of 6.13% was observed with C. pasteuranium and a majority of the rhamnose (about 6 g/L) remained in the culture medium even after the glucose concentration dropped to <1 g/L, alleviating the possibility of catabolite repression of rhamnose utilization in the presence of glucose. These results suggested that C. pasteuranium is incapable of rhamnose uptake and utilization. The total sugar utilization efficiency of CH4 remained low at 33.22%, resulting in lower hydrogen production. Thus, CH4 is not a suitable strain for the fermentation of green macroalgae hydrolysate. In contrast, for strain CGS5, the H2 production rate, H2 yield, and H2 content were 73.2 mL/L/h, 1.01 mol H2/mole RS, and 46.9%, respectively. The result indicated that CGS5 strain can utilize all of the reducing sugars glucose, xylose, and rhamnose with a utilization efficiency of 90.87%, 47.85% and 64.82%, respectively with a total reducing sugar utilization efficiency of 70.43%. Forsberg et al showed that rhamnose was catabolized by Clostridium butyricum strain effectively. The metabolic pathway for the catabolism of rhamnose has been characterized in Clostridium butyricum [24]. L-Rhamnose is metabolized by a pathway mediated by L-rhamnose permease, L-rhamnose isomerase, L-rhamnulose kinase, and L-rhamnulose-1-phosphate aldolase. The last enzyme cleaves L-rhamnulose-1-phosphate with the formation of equimolar concentrations of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and L-lactaldehyde. The dihydroxyacetone phosphate is further metabolized by glycolysis, while the lactaldehyde is either converted under aerobic conditions to lactate and pyruvate, or under anaerobic conditions, to L-1,2-propanediol by an oxidoreductase, thereby regenerating NAD to produce biohydrogen [24]. Thus, Clostridium butyricum CGS5 was chosen for the dark fermentative H2 production using green macroalgal hydrolysate. The pH decreased correspondingly with H2 production and formation of acidic soluble metabolites, indicating that hydrogen evolution was accompanied by formation of acidic soluble metabolites. Using macroalgae hydrolysate as the substrate, butyrate appeared to be the dominant soluble metabolite, as the ratio of butyrate to soluble metabolite products (HBu/SMP) was around 0.5. The second abundant metabolite was acetate, followed by lactate and ethanol (Table 4). The metabolite composition indicates that biohydrogen production with the pure isolates (Clostridium pasteurianum and Clostridium butyricum strains) belonged to butyrate-type fermentation, which is in accordance with previous findings [20]. Furthermore, the total volatile fatty acids or TVFA (soluble metabolites without ethanol)/SMP ratio was essentially around 0.95. The predominance of TVFA in total soluble metabolites suggests that H2 production was metabolically favorable since acidogenic pathway was predominant over solventogensis [25]."
10,H2 production using non-hydrolyzed macroalgae powder,"3.3 H2 production using non-hydrolyzed macroalgae powder In this study, mesophilic dark fermentation with H2 producing bacteria using macroalgae powder was investigated. For comparison, a control experiment using sucrose and macroalgae hydrolysate was also carried out. The mono sugar concentration in macroalgae powder (without hydrolysis) was 0.44 g/L (glucose 0.13 g/L, xylose 0.06 g/L and rhamnose 0.25 g/L). The results (Fig. 3 ) show that cell growth and hydrogen production were low with untreated macroalgae powder as a fermentation substrate, where the hydrogen production rate, hydrogen yield, and hydrogen content were 1.74 mL/L/h, 0.20 mol H2/mole RS, and 15.4%, respectively. Poor bio hydrogen production was observed when the microalgal biomass was not pretreated with chemicals or enzymes, suggesting the need of biomass pretreatment. The results indicated that Clostridium butyricum CGS5 could not utilized polysaccharides efficiently. Also, the comparison between macroalgae hydrolysate and sucrose as a fermentation substrate for dark fermentation was investigated. For macroalgae hydrolysate (Fig. 3), the hydrogen production rate, hydrogen yield, and hydrogen content were 73.2 mL/L/h, 1.01 mol H2/mole RS, and 46.9%, respectively, while for sucrose, the hydrogen production rate, hydrogen yield, and hydrogen content were 84.9 mL/L/h, 1.32 mol H2/mole RS, and 48.3%, respectively. The results showed H2 production using macroalgae hydrolysate was slightly lower, but still comparable with the results using sucrose. Several previous studies pointed out that Clostridium butyricum CGS5 prefer hexose over pentose as the carbon substrate for cell growth and H2 production, most likely due to a more efficient hexose metabolism [23]. Nevertheless, the results still indicated that macroalgae hydrolysate can be an alternative feedstock for bio hydrogen production in the future. The soluble metabolites are shown in Table 6 ."
11,Effect of macroalgae hydrolysate concentration on bioH2 production,"3.4 Effect of macroalgae hydrolysate concentration on bioH2 production Organic loading, such as the composition and concentration of substrate usually plays a crucial role in the efficiency of anaerobic hydrogen production [26,27]. Thus, the effect of macroalgae hydrolysate concentration was investigated. Biohydrogen production was conducted at different macroalgal hydrolysate concentration from 4 to 16 g RS/L (based on the reducing sugar concentration). Fig. 4 indicated that the cumulative hydrogen production and maximum hydrogen production rate increased along with the increase in the concentration of macroalgal hydrolysate for the concentration range of 4 to 12 g RS/L. When the concentration was further increased to 16 g RS/L, the cumulative production, production rate, and hydrogen yield decreased. At high substrate concentration, bacterial growth rate was inhibited by excess substrate (substrate inhibition) and high concentrations of fermentation by-products (Table 7 for the soluble metabolites data). The results clearly indicate that a macroalgae hydrolysate concentration of 12 g RS/L exhibited the best performance in hydrogen production for most of categories compared in Fig. 4, especially for total hydrogen production and hydrogen yield, where the H2 production rate, H2 content, and H2 yield were 75.3 mL/L/h, 45.4%, and 1.00 mol H2/mole RS, respectively. The total reducing sugar utilization decreased slightly from 77.0% to 59.5% when the concentration of macroalgal hydrolysate was increased from 4 to 16 g RS/L. A higher glucose utilization than rhamnose and xylose utilization implied that glucose was catabolized preferably over rhamnose and xylose. In addition, the result indicates that the amount of inhibitors (HMF and furfural) present in the hydrolysate did not affect the fermentation performance of Clostridium butyricum CGS5. The pH decreased correspondingly with H2 production and formation of acidic soluble metabolites, such as lactate, acetate, butyrate, and ethanol (Table 7)."
12,Effect of pH control on H2 production,"3.5 Effect of pH control on H2 production The results shown earlier indicate that an initial pH of 7.0 was preferable for bio hydrogen production, whereas hydrogen evolution stopped when the pH was lower than 5.0. This is mainly because at this low pH the cells cannot grow. Therefore, pH control seems to be a key operational parameter to improve hydrogen production performance. Dark fermentation was conducted at three different pH values, namely, 6.0, 5.5, and 5.0, to identify the optimal pH for bio hydrogen production with Clostridium butyricum CGS5. For comparison, a control experiment without pH control was also carried out. The pH range was chosen because optimal pH for anaerobic H2 production reported in literature was essentially within the range of 5.5–6.5 [28]. Fig. 5 shows that cell growth and hydrogen production were strongly inhibited at pH 5.0. Operation at pH 5.5 attained the highest total hydrogen production and hydrogen yield of 208.3 mL/L/h and 1.39 mol H2/mole RS, respectively. The H2 content was in the range of 40–51% for all tests, with the highest value of 50.2% at pH 5.5. Operation at pH 5.5 resulted in a rapid decrease in pH because the bacteria completely consumed carbon sources after 10 h cultivation and produced acidic soluble metabolites products. The major soluble metabolites producing during H2 fermentation using macroalgae hydrolysate were butyrate, acetate, lactate, and ethanol (Table 8 ). Therefore, higher hydrogen productivity and yield compared were achieved at pH 5.5, compared to pH 5.0 and 6.0. This optimal pH is the same as that proposed in our previous study when using sucrose as carbon source [29]. This indicates that the change in the type of carbon source did not affect the optimal pH for the Clostridium butyricum CGS5 in dark fermentative hydrogen production, even when a complex substrate like macroalgal hydrolysate was used."
13,BioH2 production via continuous fermentation,"3.6 BioH2 production via continuous fermentation Mass production of biohydrogen is usually achieved by continuous bioreactors. Continuous fermentation has many advantages over other fermentation methods including high productivity and better control over growth rates. The continuous culture was carried out at a progressively decreasing HRT from 8 to 4 h using macroalgae hydrolysate. Figs. 6 and 7 show that the H2 content in biogas was stably maintained at around 50–55% for over 8 days of operation. The pH varied between 5.5 and 5.8. The hydrogen production rate increased from 428.9 mL/L/h to 812.4 mL/L/h and the hydrogen yield decreased from 1.62 mol H2/mole RS to 0.98 mol H2/mole RS when the HRT was shortened from 8 to 4 h. The productivity significantly increased with a decrease in HRT due to the increase in the volumetric organic loading rate when a sufficient amount of H2 producing biomass was retained in the bioreactor. However, decreasing HRT increases the flow rate of fresh medium. When the flow rate is increasing, it will reflect in the production cost (higher substrate cost). Inverse correlation between H2 yield and HRT has been observed in many dark fermentation cases reported in the literature [30,31]. The results clearly indicate that HRT 6 h exhibited the best performance in hydrogen production for most of categories, where the H2 production rate, H2 content, and H2 yield were 782.5 mL/L/h, 51.6%, and 1.52 mol H2/mole RS, respectively. The soluble metabolites in the continuous culture consisted mainly of butyric acid, which accounted around 45% of total soluble metabolites (Fig. 7), followed by acetic acid, lactic acid, and ethanol. This composition is quite similar to that obtained in batch cultures. Under this optimal operation conditions, the maximum hydrogen production rate and hydrogen yield obtained from this work is better than those reported in related studies. Hence, Clostridium butyricum CGS5 isolate is a potential candidate for practical biohydrogen generating processes from macroalgae hydrolysate. Table 9 summarizes the studies reported in literature for biohydrogen production based on macroalgal biomass. As mentioned in Section 1, most studies use brown or red macroalgae for biohydrogen production. This could be due to the abundant availability of both these macroalgae; red and brown seaweed contribute to about 57% and 43% of the total cultivated aquatic plants [32]. Red macroalgae is cultivated for the extraction of carrageenan, and the farmed brown macroalgae kelp is a known food source [33]. Farming of these macroalgae mainly takes place in South east Asian countries. On the other hand, green macroalgae, particularly Ulva sp. or the sea lettuce is the major algae forming green algal blooms due to eutrophication and massive shoring of these algae is a potential environmental risk [34,35]. Thus, disposal of the massive macroalgal biomass that is shored could be handled in an environmental friendly way by using them for dark fermentation. We showed the feasibility that certain Clostridial species such as Clostridium butyricum presents high potential for simultaneous utilization of Ulva biomass derived sugars. Rhamnose and xylose were not metabolized by Clostridium pasterianum, indicating that the choice of the fermentative bacteria highly influences the hydrogen productivity and yield. Thus, biohydrogen production from Ulva sp. can establish effective coastal ecology management, pollution control and energy generation."
14,Conclusions,"Macroalgae has high carbohydrates content and lower lignin content, which makes them a preferable candidate for biofuels production. The green macroalgae Ulva sp. was used as a third generation sustainable feedstock for biohydrogen production in this study. Ulva sp. biomass consisted of 50.3% carbohydrates, 25.7% protein, 2.31% lipids, and 21.7% ash. The major reducing sugars released upon hydrolysis were glucose and rhamnose, followed by galactose and xylose. So it was essential to choose a Clostridial strain that could effectively metabolize rhamnose. The incapability of Clostridium pasteurianum CH4 to uptake and metabolize rhamnose was observed clearly in this study, and the species also showed poor xylose utilization. Clostridium butyricum CGS5 could uptake and metabolize rhamnose and xylose simultaneously, indicating the suitability of this strain for fermentation of mixed sugars from renewable biomass. Thus, the best-macroalgae hydrolysate based H2 producer was Clostridium butyricum CGS5 with 12 g RS/L concentration of reducing sugar and pH control 5.5 and attained H2 production rate, H2 yield, and H2 content of 208.2 mL/L/h, 1.39 mol H2/mole RS, and 50.3%, respectively. Continuous fermentation strategy (HRT 6 h) was done to achieve a higher productivity of 782.5 mL/L/h and H2 yield was 1.52 mol H2/mol RS. Under this optimal operation conditions, the maximum hydrogen production rate and hydrogen yield obtained from this work is better than those reported in related studies. Even though many studies reported biohydrogen production from brown and red macroalgae, we report for the first time effective hydrolysis and fermentation of the green macroalga Ulva sp. for biohydrogen production."
