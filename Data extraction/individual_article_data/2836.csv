0,Introduction,"Among alternative energy systems, hydrogen appears as an excellent energy vector. The production of hydrogen from biomass is receiving increased attention as a potential source of renewable energy respect to global issues of sustainability. In this context, ethanol may represent an interesting source for hydrogen production because: (i) its low toxicity, (ii) its relatively high hydrogen content, and (iii) its availability and ease of handling. Solar hydrogen production from ethanol involving photo-catalytic processes using semiconductor materials is progressively investigated as a promising way of generating hydrogen in a sustainable manner [1–6]. Among the active semiconductors reported for this process, those based on TiO2 are attractive candidates due to their photochemical stability and low cost. However, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 for this reaction is limited as a consequence of its relatively large energy band gap (3.2eV) that limits their capacity to absorb visible light. Therefore the increase of the photocatalyst efficiency of TiO2 is a major challenge in the development of photocatalysts for hydrogen production from ethanol using solar energy. A common strategy to increase the efficiency in the use of active photogenerated charges consists in the deposition of noble metals (e.g. Pt, Rh, Au) or metal oxides (e.g. NiO, RuO2) onto the photocatalyst surface [7–13]. The cocatalyst improves the efficiency of photocatalysts as a result of: (i) the capture of conduction band electrons or valence band holes from the photocatalysts [14], thereby reducing the possibility of electron-hole recombination (Schottky barrier electron trapping), and/or (ii) the transference of electrons and holes to surface molecules, thereby reducing the activation energy for the redox reactions [15]. Among the cocatalysts studied, Pt particles supported on TiO2 have been found to be very active for the photo-dehydrogenation of primary alcohols [16]. Taking into account the generally accepted mechanism of dehydrogenation of alcohols on TiO2, oxidation of alcohol by holes photogenerated on TiO2 surface producing hydrogen ions that are reduced on Pt sites by photogenerated electrons [17–22], it is evident that the activity and efficiency of the Pt/TiO2 photo-catalysts are strongly dependent on the quantity, structure and electronic state of Pt deposited on the TiO2 surface. In spite of this, the scarce studies reported in this area [23,3,24,25] do not allow to have a clear relationship among the structural and electronic characteristics of the Pt and the efficiency of photocatalysts. For that reason, in this work we have addressed the role of the incorporation of Pt on TiO2 by different methodologies, analyzing its effect on the physical properties of the Pt particles (particle dispersion and electronic state) as well as in their photoactivity for hydrogen production from ethanol."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Pt/TiO2 photo-catalysts were prepared by deposition–precipitation (Pt–PD) and wet impregnation methods (using three different Pt precursors) over TiO2 particles (titanium (IV) oxide, catalyst support 100% anatase Alfa Aesar stabilized by thermal treatment at 473K for 4h). All Pt/TiO2 samples were prepared to obtain a Pt metal loading of 0.5wt%. Impregnated Pt/TiO2 photo-catalysts were prepared using aqueous solutions of three different Pt precursors (H2PtCl6 (Pt–I–C), [Pt(NH3)4](NO3)2 (Pt–I–N) or Pt(C5H7O2)2 (Pt–I–A)) at 343K under stirring for 1h. After Pt incorporation, the samples were dried at 383K for 4h and subsequently calcined under air at 473K for 8h. For the Pt/TiO2 photo-catalyst prepared by deposition–precipitation, the Pt was deposited on TiO2 particles using an aqueous solution (7mL/g TiO2) containing ethylene glycol (20mL/g TiO2) and H2PtCl6 to have a final Pt loading of 0.5wt%. The reduction of Pt precursor was done at 403K for 2h under stirring and reflux under inert gas. After that, the solids were filtered and extensively washed with deionised water until the concentration of Cl− ions in the filtrate solution was lower than 0.01ppm. The Pt/TiO2 solid was dried under air at 383K for 4h and subsequently calcined at 473K for 8h."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Textural properties of Pt/TiO2 photo-catalysts were obtained from N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77K over the whole range of relative pressures, using a Micromeritics ASAP 2100 automatic device on samples previously degassed at 423K for 12h. Specific surface areas were calculated using the BET method and taking a value of 0.162nm2 for the cross-section of the physically adsorbed N2 molecule. The chemical composition of the catalysts was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP–AES), using a Perkin-Elmer Optima 3300DV apparatus. The samples were first dissolved in acid solutions (a mixture of HF, HCl and HNO3), microwaved for 15min, and diluted to concentrations within the detection range of the instrument. Crystalline structures were analyzed by X-ray diffraction using a Seifert 3000P vertical diffractometer and nickel-filtered CuKα radiation (λ =0.1538nm) following the step-scanning procedure (step size 0.04°, Bragg angles scanning from 5 to 80°). Volume-averaged crystallite sizes were determined by applying the Debye–Scherrer equation. The UV–vis spectra of photocatalysts were measured on a Shimadzu UV2100 instrument equipped with a Labsphere diffuse reflectance accessory. Band gap size was obtained by plotting a tangent line over the slope of the UV–vis spectra and prolonging it to f(R)=0. The wavelength value obtained was converted to [eV] given E ph = hc 2 , where h is the Plank constant and c the speed of light. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to study the chemical composition and oxidation state of the photocatalysts surface. Photoelectron spectra were recorded with a VG Escalab 200R electron spectrometer equipped with a MgKα X-ray source (hν =1253.6eV) and a hemispherical electron analyser operating at constant transmission energy (20eV). The areas of the peaks were estimated by calculating the integral of each peak after subtracting a Shirley background and fitting the experimental peak to a combination of Lorentzian/Gaussian lines of variable proportions. Quantification of the atomic fractions on the sample surface was obtained by integration of the peaks with appropriate corrections for sensitivity factors [26]."
4,Photo-catalytic measurements,"2.3 Photo-catalytic measurements Photocatalytic activity of Pt/TiO2 samples were determined in a closed Pyrex glass reactor (200mL) working at room temperature and pressure and filled with Ar atmosphere (0.1barg). Prior to reaction, the photocatalysts were reduced at 573K for 2h (heating rate 5K/min) with 50mL (STP)/min of a 10vol% H2/N2 mixture. The reduced photocatalyst powders (5mg) were transferred to the photocatalytic reactor and dispersed by magnetic stirring in an aqueous solution (150mL) containing 0.05M ethanol. The photocatalyst was irradiated with a Xe arc lamp (150W, ozone free, LOT Oriel GmbH& CO KG, 1.36W/m2 UV). Before measurement, the solution was purged several times with Ar to ensure the complete air removal. Samples of the evolved gases were extracted periodically (every 30min for a total reaction time of 5h) and analyzed by GC with TCD (Varian chromatograph Model Star 3400 CX) equipped with Porapack Q (CO2, C2H6, C2H4, water, acetaldehyde, ethanol, acetone, acetic acid, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, and crotonaldehyde) and molecular sieve 5A (H2, O2, N2, CO) packed columns connected in series, using Ar as carrier gas."
5,Results,
6,Chemical composition and textural properties,"3.1 Chemical composition and textural properties Table 1 shows the chemical compositions obtained from ICP analyses, expressed as Pt weight percentage, of the calcined photo-catalysts. As Table 1 indicates, the Pt content for all samples was lower than the theoretical values, specially in the case of the photo-catalyst prepared by precipitation–deposition method (Pt–PD), indicating the lower efficiency for the Pt incorporation by this method respect to that achieved for wet impregnation methods [27]. The textural data offered in Table 1 show that the specific area and pore volume values for the bare TiO2 support does not change significantly upon incorporating Pt to TiO2. The slight decrease in pore volume indicates some filling of the pores by platinum species."
7,X-ray diffraction,"3.2 X-ray diffraction The crystal structure of bare TiO2 and reduced Pt/TiO2 photo-catalysts was investigated by X-ray diffraction being the diffraction patterns collected in Fig. 1 . As it can be observed, all Pt/TiO2 samples exhibited reflections at 2Θ angles of 25.3°, 37.8° and 48.1° characteristic of TiO2 in anatase structure (JCPDS 84-1286). No signal from Pt species can be observed in the diffraction patterns. This is due to the low concentration of Pt on the TiO2 but it could also be a sign of the high dispersion of Pt species, since no periodic structures can be observed. Quantitative estimation of crystallite sizes of TiO2 anatase particles by applying the Scherrer formula was also calculated from the broadening of the (101) reflection (at 2θ angle of 47.5). It can be noted that mean crystallite size of the TiO2 particles was 14nm and it does not change with platinum loading nor reduction treatment."
8,UV–vis spectra,"3.3 UV–vis spectra Fig. 2 shows the UV–vis absorption spectra of Pt/TiO2 photo-catalysts. Pure TiO2 shows a sharp absorption edge around 350nm characteristic of the TiO2 with anatase structure. The absorption edges of photocatalysts gradually shift to visible range with the incorporation of Pt to the TiO2 due to the absorption of visible light of the highly dispersed Pt entities on the TiO2 [24]. The band gap for each catalyst, calculated from the onset of the absorption edges, is given in Table 1. One can notice that the band gap for Pt/TiO2 photo-catalysts were lower than the value of 3.2eV found for pure TiO2. The differences in the binding energy of Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts may be caused, by modifications in the dispersion of the Pt particles and/or changes in the oxidation degree of these particles [24]."
9,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),"3.4 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) The chemical state and surface exposition of Pt species present on the TiO2 surfaces after reduction were evaluated by XPS. The energy region of Pt 4f core-level was recorded (Fig. 3 ) and the binding energies corresponding to fresh reduced catalysts were collected in Table 2 . The fresh reduced Pt/TiO2 photo-catalysts showed a Pt 4f7/2 peak of different symmetry which could be resolved, after curve fitting procedures, in components at binding energies in the range of 70.4–71.5eV (Table 2). These components can be ascribed to metallic Pt species with different interaction with the TiO2 surface. Metallic Pt particles weakly interacting with TiO2 surface are expected to appear around 70.8–71.0eV while lower binding energies are observed for small clusters of metallic Pt strongly interacting with supports [28,29]. The peak percentages corresponding to the above components in the Pt 4f7/2 level, summarised in Table 2, revealed differences in the electronic properties of Pt nanoparticles depending on the method of preparation. The platinum species on the photo-catalysts prepared by impregnation using Pt-nitrate (Pt–I–N) or Pt-chloride precursors (Pt–I–C) are completely reduced observing all platinum surface species in metallic state (Pt0). For sample prepared using Pt-acetate precursor (Pt–I–A) the reduction of platinum was incomplete (ca. 70%) being a substantial part of platinum species (30%) partially charged (71.5eV – Pt δ+). This may be due to a strong Ti–O–Pt interaction between platinum and the TiO2 support which has been reported to stabilise platinum entities in an oxidised state [29,30]. Complete platinum reduction with some polarization of Pt particles (70.4eV – Pt δ−) was observed in the sample prepared by the deposition–precipitation (Pt–PD). Some authors [28] interpreted this polarization in terms of the development of Pt–Ti interactions. The surface atomic Pt/Ti ratio calculated from XPS intensities are listed in Table 2 and its comparison with bulk Pt/Ti ratio is depicted in Fig. 4 . All Pt/TiO2 photo-catalysts show a Pt/Al surface ratio higher than the expected value derived from their chemical composition because the porous nature of the TiO2. Data presented in Fig. 4 indicate differences in the Pt dispersion with the method used for the incorporation of Pt on the TiO2 surface. Therefore the surface concentration of metallic platinum on Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts decreases following the order: Pt–I–C>Pt–I–A>Pt–I–N≈Pt–PD."
10,Photocatalytic activity,"3.5 Photocatalytic activity Fig. 5 reports the hydrogen evolution rate over each Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts as a function of reaction time. This figure depicts the values of hydrogen production before reach the equilibrium in order to observe more clearly the differences in the photoactivity of the samples (for all samples the equilibrium is reached after time-on-stream higher than 8h). The hydrogen evolution rate over pure TiO2 is also shown for comparison. All Pt/TiO2 photo-catalysts showed relatively high hydrogen formation rates. The rate of hydrogen formation on Pt/TiO2 samples is much higher than that obtained with the pure TiO2 reference that is practically inactive in this reaction as expected [3]. From Fig. 5 it is observed that there is a difference in the photocatalytic H2 production depending on the method used to disperse the platinum metal. Pt particles on TiO2 prepared by deposition–precipitation method (Pt–PD) were considerably more active than Pt particles prepared by impregnation methods. For all photo-catalysts studied the analyses of gas products only detected hydrogen with not presence of other by-products such as ethylene, CO2 or CH4. This product distribution is consistent with a partial dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde according to Eq. (1) [20]. (1) CH3CH2OH → H2 +CH3CHO Conversion of ethanol, calculated from hydrogen production data assuming the partial dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde according to Eq. (1), ranges from 26% (for the most active Pt–PD catalysts) to 6.6% (for the less active Pt–I–N). Since Pt particles have an active role in the photoactivity of Pt/TiO2 catalysts, as Schottky barrier and dehydrogenation sites, the surface dispersion of Pt particles should clearly influence on the activity of photocatalysts. XPS data in Table 2 showed differences in the Pt surface concentration with the method used for the incorporation of Pt on the TiO2 surface. From XPS data is then possible to normalize the hydrogen production respect to exposed Pt atoms at the surface. Fig. 6 presents these normalized hydrogen production rates over each Pt/TiO2 catalysts respect to the Pt surface concentration determined by XPS. As Fig. 6 shows, normalized H2 production rates are not constant respect the Pt surface concentration on the Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts decreasing the normalized activity of Pt particles on TiO2 in the order: Pt–PD>Pt–I–C≈Pt–I–A>Pt–I–N. The observed changes in the normalized photoactivity of Pt particles indicated that the characteristics of Pt particles have strong influence on its photocatalytic activities as will be discussed in the next section."
11,Discussion,"The photo-activity of Pt/TiO2 samples is related with an effective generation and utilization of photo-carriers (electrons/holes). The generation of photo-carriers is governed by the photo-optical properties of Pt/TiO2 (light absorption capacity) while their utilization is related with the band levels, crystallinity, surface morphology and presence of Pt co-catalyst. To achieve a high photo-catalytic activity, the Pt/TiO2 photo-catalyst should have a high light absorption capacity and a low electron/hole recombination. Narrow band gap increases the light absorption while a good crystallinity and few crystal defects decreases the electron/hole recombination. Additionally, the Pt particles act as Schottky barrier that traps photoelectrons and also act as active sites for the production of H2. Therefore the number, metal-support sites and electronic state of Pt particles have strong influence on the photocatalytic activity of Pt/TiO2 samples. The physicochemical characterization of Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts performed in this work shows that the variation in method of incorporation of Pt did not induce significant textural nor structural changes on the TiO2 support. As it can be observed from N2 adsorption isotherms (Table 1) and XRD data (Fig. 1), the surface morphology and crystallinity of TiO2 did not change after the incorporation of Pt. Therefore the observed differences in activity among the Pt/TiO2 samples (Fig. 5) are not related with a change in the electron/hole recombination associated to changes in the crystallinity and/or surface morphology of TiO2 after platinization. The photo-optical properties of Pt/TiO2 (Fig. 2 and Table 1) revealed a slight change in the band gap of the catalysts with the type of methodology used for deposition of Pt particles on TiO2. The variation in the band gap of the Pt/TiO2 catalysts is consistent with the variation in surface exposition of metallic Pt particles on TiO2 determined by XPS (Table 2), indicating this fact that the observed variation in the band gap is mainly associated to the absorption of visible light of the highly dispersed metallic Pt entities on the TiO2 [27] . As it was previously indicated, the number of Pt–TiO2 interaction and the electronic state of Pt particles are crucial factors influencing the activity of Pt/TiO2 photo-catalysts. Therefore, the differences in these factors may justify the differences in activity observed for the photo-catalysts studied in this work. By comparing the electronic state and surface concentration of Pt species on Pt–I–N and Pt–I–C samples (Pt0 in both samples, Pt surface concentration: Pt–I–C≫Pt–I–N, Table 2) with the normalized photocatalytic hydrogen production of both samples (Pt–I–C>Pt–I–N, Fig. 5) it appears that difference in activity is not related with geometrical factors of metal Pt particles. A similar weak dependence of the rate of H2 evolution on the metal surface concentration has been observed in literature for photocatalysts containing platinum [16,19,28]. These studies justify the weak dependence of geometrical factors of Pt particles on photoactivity indicating the possibility of the participation of sites located at the interfaces between Pt particles and TiO2 as locations for the photocatalytic reactions. The comparison of normalized photocatalytic hydrogen production on Pt–PD and Pt–I–N samples (Pt–PD>Pt–I–N, Fig. 5) with the electronic state of Pt species (both with similar Pt concentration but presenting Pt0 in P–I–N and Pt0 +Pt δ− in Pt–PD, Table 2) indicated the higher intrinsic activities of the Pt δ− species respect to the Pt metallic counterparts. According to the mechanism proposed in literature for ethanol dehydrogenation on transition metals deposited on TiO2 [19–22,25], the role of Pt particles is the participation in trapping electrons and their subsequent transference to hydrogen ions to generate hydrogen (Eqs. (2)–(7)). (2) TiO2 + hν →e− +h+ (3) H2O+h+ →H+ +OH (4) CH3CH2OH+OH +h+ →CH3CHO+H2O+H+ (5) CH3CH2OH(g)+TiO(s) →CH3CH2OH–Ti (s)+O–H(s) (6) CH3CH2OH–Ti(s)+2h+ →CH3CH2O(g)+Ti(s)+2H+(s) (7) 2H+(s)+2e− →Pt0 →H2(g) The fact that Pt δ− species are more reactive than metallic Pt ones implies either that Pt δ− species trap more electrons from TiO2 or that Pt δ− species transfer these electrons more efficiently taking into account the mechanism of dehydrogenation of ethanol over platinum deposited on TiO2. The better photo-activity of Pt δ− species has been noted previously [3] and it was attributed to the higher electron density and better electron conductivity of these species respect to metallic Pt counterparts. The intrinsic activity of Pt–I–A sample is in between of that corresponding to Pt–I–N and Pt–I–Cl samples (Fig. 5). The main difference in the platinum species appearing in these samples is that the Pt–I–A sample includes a substantial part of platinum in partially oxidized form (Pt δ+, Table 2). Therefore, it suggests that the presence of Pt δ+ species improves the photo-activity respect to metallic Pt. This fact is contrary to what is generally observed about the lower intrinsic activity of oxidized Pt species respect to the metallic ones. Although both metallic Pt and oxidized Pt species can trap electrons that could be subsequently transferred, TiO2 with oxidized Pt species is generally accepted be less reactive than TiO2 with metallic Pt because oxidized Pt species could also act as recombination centres [23,31]. This means that in our case, other factors should also be considered, such as changes in the adsorption of hydrogen ions associated to the presence of oxidized Pt particles that could improve its interaction with the generated e-carriers [32]. This hypothesis needs to be verified in further studies."
12,Conclusions,The influence of the characteristics of Pt particles dispersed on TiO2 prepared by different methodologies was investigated for the H2 photo-production from aqueous solutions containing ethanol. The physicochemical characterization of reduced Pt/TiO2 photo-catalysts shows differences in the electronic state of Pt particles as consequence of differences in the Pt–TiO2 interactions. It has been found that H2 production rates on Pt/TiO2 photo-catalysts depend on the characteristics of Pt particles. A weak dependence of geometrical factors of Pt particles on photoactivity was found when Pt was present in metallic form (samples Pt–I–C and Pt–I–N). This fact indicates the possibility of the participation of sites located at the interfaces between Pt particles and TiO2 as locations for the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of ethanol on metallic Pt. Stronger interaction of Pt nanoparticles with TiO2 support were observed in Pt–I–A and Pt–PD samples leading to some polarization of Pt particles (Pt δ+ and Pt δ−). These polarized Pt particles exhibit better intrinsic photo-activity than that observed for metallic Pt. The better intrinsic activity observed for Pt δ− particles (Pt–PD) is attributed to the better e− conductivity of the partially charged Pt particles that may enhance the trapping electrons and thereby extending the e−/h + carriers separation at surface of photo-catalysts. The improvement of activity observed In the case of oxidized Pt particles (Pt δ+ in Pt–I–A sample) is hypothesized to be consequence of changes in the adsorption of hydrogen ions that may enhance the electron transfer to this ions facilitating therefore the hydrogen generation on these particles.
