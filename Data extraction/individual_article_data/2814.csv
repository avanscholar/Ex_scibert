0,Introduction,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a common and useful environmentally friendly oxidant for organic synthesis, as it emits only water as a byproduct and shows high atomic efficiency [1,2]. It also claims much attention as a next generation sustainable solar fuel because of its high energy density and easy storage [3]. In the present state of the art, continuous on-site production of H2O2 is based on the complex anthraquinone process. This process includes multistep hydrogenation and oxidation reactions, which are energy-consuming [4]. Therefore, direct production of H2O2 from hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) gases with Pd or bimetallic Au–Pd catalysts has been extensively studied [5–7]. This direct synthesis can be a green alternative for H2O2 synthesis, although some care is still necessary because of the explosive nature of H2/O2 mixed gases. Therefore, the development of a process for H2O2 production from water and O2 is a great challenge in chemistry. In this regard, several approaches have been studied, including electrochemical, photocatalytic, and photoelectrochemical processes [8–11]. Specifically, photocatalytic production of H2O2 has been comprehensively studied as a promising method for utilizing light energy to generate H2O2. Photocatalytic H2O2 production has been studied using different photocatalysts such as titanium dioxide, carbon nitride (g-C3N4), and polynuclear transition metal complexes [12–14]. As these reactions are carried out at room temperature without H2, they are safe compared with direct synthesis of H2O2. These reactions are generally carried out by light irradiation of O2-saturated water with a photocatalyst in the presence of an organic electron donor such as an alcohol, oxalic acid, or formic acid. The formation of H2O2 is insignificant in the absence of such organic electron donors [9,15,16]. Removal of by-products of such organic electron donors is essential to obtain pure H2O2. Therefore, photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 using water (an organic-electron-donor-free system) to achieve high concentration of pure H2O2 is highly demanding and challenging. This process has no by-products and thus no need of further purification to obtain pure H2O2. However, very few reports of the production of H2O2 under organic-electron-donor-free conditions are found. Electron-deficient aromatic-diimide-modified g-C3N4 composites were recently shown to be photocatalytically active for synthesis of H2O2 in THE absence of organic electron donors under sunlight illumination due to their perfect band gap [17]. The band gap of g-C3N4 was adjusted by varying the amount of incorporated aromatic diimide to achieve maximum H2O2 production. The catalytic activity of this modified g-C3N4 was inferior and the amount of H2O2 formed after 48h reaction was only 50μM. A heterogeneous catalyst containing TiO2, silicon, and gold was also used for production of H2O2 from water, but the concentration of H2O2 reached only 40μM under solar simulated illumination in the presence of Sc3+ [18]. Moon and co-workers found that a reduced graphene oxide (RGO)–TiO2 hybrid showed good photocatalytic activity for production of H2O2 after adsorption of in situ generated cobalt phosphate on the catalyst surface [19]. Another strategy was developed to achieve a significant amount of H2O2 through sensitized triplet–triplet annihilation up-conversion of the ternary nanohybrid by Kim and co-workers [20]. H2O2 was also produced from water in the absence of organic electron donors using [RuII(Me2phen)3]2+ (Me2phen=4,7-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline) as a photocatalyst with cyano-bridged polynuclear transition metal complexes composed of Fe and Co as co-catalysts in the presence of Sc3+ under visible light irradiation [14]. All the reported photocatalysts either possess low photocatalytic activity or require presence of co-catalysts/special compounds to enhance the production of H2O2. Thus, the development of a sunlight-driven photocatalyst (without any co-catalyst) with high catalytic activity remains a daunting challenge for H2O2 production. Herein, it is pertinent to mention that both conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) positions of the photocatalyst are vital for the efficient production of H2O2 [17]. The top of the VB of CdS lies at approximately 1.8V (versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), pH 7), which is sufficiently high for water oxidation (∼0.8V) [21]. It provides a strong thermodynamic driving force and promotes water oxidation. In addition to this, high selectivity for the two-electron reduction of O2 is required for efficient production of H2O2. The CB level of CdS lies at −0.6V, which is more negative than the reduction potential of O2 (0.08V); therefore, CdS provides enough potential for O2 reduction [22,23]. Thus, the band position of CdS perfectly satisfies the thermodynamic requirements for photocatalytic production of H2O2. Even though CdS has these advantages, it also possesses a small adsorption capacity toward reactants, poor photostability, and an aggregation tendency. These lacunae result in a reduction of surface area and an increase in the recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers, leading to decreased photoactivity [24]. In the past several years, many breakthroughs have been achieved in the fabrication of CdS–reduced graphene oxide (RGO) hybrids to address these problems [25,26]. The Fermi level of RGO is lower than the conduction band (CB) of CdS, so the photo-formed electrons in CdS can certainly be transferred to dioxygen or protons through RGO sheets [19]. This facilitates charge pair separation and enhanced photocatalytic activity. Thus, CdS–graphene hybrids may be suitable materials for photocatalytic production of H2O2. In this report, CdS–RGO hybrids were synthesized by the hydrothermal process and were used as heterogeneous photocatalysts for sustainable production of H2O2 from H2O and O2 under sunlight. The production of H2O2 was investigated by varying parameters such as reaction time, temperature, and pH."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Graphite was purchased from Sigma Aldrich, Germany. Sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98%), potassium permanganate (KMnO4), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30%), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), anhydrous ethanol (CH3CH2OH), cadmium acetate (Cd(CH3CO2)2·2H2O), and thiourea (H2NCSHN2) were purchased from Samchun Pure Chemical Co. Ltd., Korea. All of these chemicals were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. A modified form of Hummers’ method was used to prepare graphene oxide (GO) [27]."
3,Synthesis of CdS–RGO hybrid,"2.2 Synthesis of CdS–RGO hybrid To synthesize a CdS–RGO hybrid, 0.799g of cadmium acetate and 0.685g of thiourea (1:3 mole ratio) were mixed in 60mL of distilled water to make a homogenous solution. Then the required amount of GO (1mg/mL) was added into the solution, which was sonicated for 30min to form a homogeneous suspension. Last, the mixture was transferred to a 100mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was maintained at 180°C for 12h. The products were centrifuged and washed with distilled water and ethanol. Then the as-synthesized CdS–RGO hybrid was dried in a vacuum oven at 60°C. Three different hybrids were synthesized with different wt.% of RGO (10, 20, and 30wt.%) with respect to CdS, and the obtained hybrids were named CdS-G1, CdS-G2, and CdS-G3, respectively. CdS nanoparticles and RGO were also synthesized separately for comparison of photocatalytic activity following the same hydrothermal method without using GO and cadmium acetate."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the samples was performed at room temperature using a D/Max 2500 V/PC (Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) at a scan rate of 1°min−1. Raman spectra of the samples were obtained with a Nanofinder 30 (Tokyo Instruments Co., Osaka, Japan) with a laser wavelength of 514nm and a 100μm spot size. The chemical composition and state of the composite were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using an axis-Nova, Kratos Analytical Ltd., Manchester, UK. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) of the RGO, CdS, and CdS–RGO hybrids were carried out on a JSM-6701F instrument (JEOL Co., Japan). Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images of the sample were obtained using a JEM-2100 FS (JEOL, Japan) microscope at 120kV at the Jeonju Center of KBSI."
5,Photocatalytic activity test,"2.4 Photocatalytic activity test First, 50mg of photocatalyst was dispersed in 50mL of water by ultrasonication for 15min. The pH of the dispersion was adjusted to 5.0 using 0.1M H2SO4. Then the mixture was placed in a 100mL conical flask sealed with a rubber septum cap, and O2 was bubbled through the solution for 15min to obtain an O2 equilibrated environment. Before sunlight illumination, the suspension was stirred in the dark for 1h to ensure adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the sample and reactant. Then the conical flask was immersed in a temperature-controlled water bath under sunlight with magnetic stirring. Sunlight–driven photocatalysis was performed from 9am to 3pm in a laboratory building (35.8468°N, 127.1294°E) in the months of April–June on sunny days (average temperature, 21±3°C, and humidity, 65±1%), with a light intensity of 70,000–80,000lux. After the reaction, the catalyst was recovered by centrifugation at 10,000rpm. The H2O2 amount was determined by redox titration with KMnO4 (0.2mM) with the addition of 5mL of a 1M H2SO4 solution. The concentration of the KMnO4 solution was considered to be equivalent to the concentration of H2O2 when the solution turned pink after the addition of KMnO4 and remained pink for 30s [28]. Another experiment was carried out under a Xe lamp. In this case, the conical flask containing the reaction mixture was immersed in a temperature-controlled water bath at 25°C and photoirradiated at λ >420nm using a 300W Xe lamp (USHIO Inc.)with magnetic stirring."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of the CdS–RGO hybrid,"3.1 Characterization of the CdS–RGO hybrid X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of as-synthesized RGO, CdS, and CdS–RGO hybrids are shown in Fig. 1 . RGO exhibited a broad (002) diffraction peak at 26°, whereas CdS, CdS-G1 and CdS-G3 showed three diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 26.5°, 43.9° and 52.0°, which were assigned to a cubic phase of CdS, while the other weak peaks at 2θ of 24.9°, 28.2°, and 47.9° were ascribed to a hexagonal phase of CdS [29]. CdS–RGO hybrids displayed XRD patterns similar to those of CdS nanoparticles. The XRD analysis further revealed that the presence of RGO did not result in the development of new crystal orientations of CdS. No typical diffraction peaks of RGO were found in the hybrids, which may be due to the relatively low diffraction intensity of RGO. The Raman spectra of as-synthesized CdS, GO, and CdS–RGO hybrids are displayed in Fig. 2 . There are two peaks at about 300.8 and 598.5cm−1 in the spectra of CdS and CdS-G2, which are assigned to the fundamental longitudinal optical phonon mode (1LO) and the first overtone mode (2LO) [30]. The observed LO Raman peak positions agree very well with those reported for cubic CdS [31]. The Raman spectrum of GO consists of two sharp peaks at 1342 and 1588cm−1, corresponding to the D and G bands, respectively [29]. The intensity of the D band (I D) was related to the presence of defects and disorder in the surface of the GO sheet. The I G was associated with the vibration of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms in the 2D hexagonal lattice of GO. The ratios of relative intensity of the D band to that of the G bands of GO and the CdS-G2 hybrid were 0.82 and 0.98, respectively. The enhancement in the relative intensity ratio I D/I G of the hybrid suggests that the relative fraction of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms decreased, resulting in a distorted structure of the CdS-G2 hybrid due to the redox reaction for the nucleation of CdS nanoparticles on the surface of RGO [31]. In addition to the D and G band peaks, two optical vibrational Raman active modes of CdS nanoparticles were also observed in the spectra of the CdS-G2 hybrid. Fig.3 a–c shows the FE-SEM images of the RGO, the CdS nanoparticles, and the CdS-G2 hybrid. RGO exhibited a 2D sheetlike morphology with a highly wrinkled and folded surface with a high degree of curvature. Due to the presence of folds and curvature, the number of RGO layers and the boundaries between the sheets could not be distinguished in the as-synthesized RGO. However, when RGO sheets were incorporated into the CdS nanoparticles, the surfaces of the RGO sheets became rough, highly curled, and densely packed with spherically shaped CdS nanoparticles. Fig.3c reveals that the CdS nanoparticles were homogeneously distributed and enwrapped in RGO. The even distribution of CdS nanoparticles on the RGO and the intimate interactions between them had a profound influence on the hybrid material photocatalytic activity. The surface morphology of the as-synthesized samples was further examined by TEM. Fig.4 a and b shows that the graphene layer was high-quality and defect-free, which was further confirmed by selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns. The SAED pattern showed as-synthesized RGO sheets with a hexagonal network and high crystallinity. The TEM image of the hybrid showed that the CdS nanoparticles had a uniform distribution over the RGO sheets (Fig.4d). The CdS particle size distributions are also shown in the inset of Fig.4c. The average particle size of CdS nanoparticles was 10–15nm and the particle size increased slightly in the hybrid. As shown in Fig. 4, a large number of CdS nanoparticles were attached to the RGO sheets. Moreover, very little agglomeration was observed for CdS particles without RGO, and the CdS nanoparticles were randomly stacked together. The graphene sheets may play an important role as a support material in assisting CdS nanoparticle growth and dispersion on the surface; at the same time, CdS decoration helps to prevent aggregation of the RGO sheets [31]. XPS was employed to analyze the composition and electronic structure of the materials. It can also provide information about the chemical environment of the elements in the composites. The C1s XPS spectra of GO and CdS-G2 are displayed in Fig.5 a and d. Fig.5a shows three distinct peaks, centered at binding energies of 288.7, 286.5, and 284.6eV, which are assigned to CO, CO, and CC, respectively [29]. Although the C1s XPS spectrum of CdS-G3 (Fig.5d) exhibited these same oxygen-containing functional groups, their peak area ratios were reduced significantly. Most of the carbon atoms were sp2 hybridized. The ratio of the peak area CO bonds to that of the CC bonds decreased from 18.3% for GO to 12.2% for CdS-G3. In CdS-G3, a visible reduction in the ratio of the peak area for the CO bond was also observed compared with that of GO. In Fig.5e, the peaks due to the Cd3d doublet are located at 404.4 and 411.1eV, with a peak separation of 6.7eV. Similarly, the binding energies of the doublet peaks of S2p are located at 161.5 and 162.8eV. There was a slight shift in the Cd3d peaks to lower binding energies (from 405.5eV to 404.4eV, and from 412.2eV to 411.1eV) in the hybrid compared with CdS nanoparticles. A possible reason for this is that Cd atoms accepted electrons from RGO, which caused the electron density around the Cd atoms to increase, resulting in a decrease in CdS bond length."
8,Photocatalytic production of H2O2,"3.2 Photocatalytic production of H2O2 All the photocatalytic reactions were carried out with oxygen-equilibrated water containing photocatalysts under sunlight. As the decomposition of H2O2 increases sharply above pH5, all the photocatalytic reactions were performed at this pH. Time-dependent profiles of H2O2 production with different photocatalyst are shown in Fig.6 a and b. CdS nanoparticles produced H2O2, but the amount was small (27μM), as shown in Fig.6a. This is due to the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers in CdS nanoparticles, which leads to a decrease in photoactivity [21]. All of the hybrids produced H2O2 more effectively than the CdS nanoparticles, and the rate of H2O2 production was significantly enhanced after incorporation of RGO (Fig.6b). The rate of H2O2 production increased with increasing amount of RGO incorporated into the photocatalysts. CdS-G2 (20wt.% RGO with respect to the mass of CdS) showed the maximum photocatalytic activity, and the amount of produced H2O2 was 128μM after 12h of sunlight irradiation, which was almost five times more than that obtained with CdS nanoparticles. Such enhancement in photocatalytic performance is usually due to the roles of RGO in the hybrid. These roles include promoting charge carrier separation and transfer, enhancing light absorption capacity, and providing an increased number of adsorption and reaction sites [21]. This can be verified by photoluminescence (PL) results as shown in Fig. 7 . The extent of the fluorescence quenching is found to be noticeably enhanced in CdS-G2 hybrid compare to CdS nanoparticles. This suggests a significant decrease in the recombination of photogenerated electrons with holes in the hybrid photocatalyst. This also indicates that the CB e− transfer from the photoexcited CdS to RGO indeed enhances charge separation, as observed for related semiconductor/RGO systems. The work function of RGO is −0.08V (vs. NHE, pH 0) and is more positive than the CB level of CdS (−0.52V vs. NHE, pH 0) [21,32]. This clearly suggests that the CB e− transfer from the photoexcited CdS to RGO occurs thermodynamically favorably and promotes efficient charge separation. The band gap of the synthesized CdS nanoparticles was determined from UV–visible spectra and was found to be 2.36eV (Supplementary Information, Fig. S1). This band position is perfect for photocatalytic reaction under sunlight. We noticed that the production rate slowly decreased after 6h and became a plateau in H2O2 production. This may be due to decomposition of H2O2 in higher concentrations of formed H2O2. To confirm this, we carried out a decomposition study of the H2O2 reaction for 12h, which showed a significant decrease in the concentration of H2O2 with time (Supplementary Information, Fig. S2). The production of H2O2 under a solar simulator was also carried out. As shown in Fig. 8 , the production of H2O2 under a solar simulator was less than that under sunlight (Fig. 6). This may be due to lower intensity of light when the solar simulator was used. The production rate of H2O2 declined when an excess amount of RGO (30wt.%) was incorporated into the hybrid photocatalyst. This could be due to the light-shielding effect of RGO and the decrease in CdS content [20]. We also carried out the same photocatalytic reaction with RGO, which did not produce H2O2 (less than the detection limit, 0.2μM). This indicates that RGO did not possess photocatalytic activity for the production of H2O2, but acted as a co-catalyst or an electron transfer mediator in the hybrid photocatalyst. In situ decomposition of H2O2 also affects the overall production of H2O2 in the presence of the photocatalyst, because H2O2 can degrade due to both CB electrons and VB holes as soon as it is produced: (1) H 2 O 2 + H + + e - → H 2 O + OH , (2) H 2 O 2 + 2 H + + 2 e - → 2 H 2 O, (3) H 2 O 2 + h + → H + + HO 2 , (4) H 2 O 2 + 2 h + → 2 H + + O 2 . The gradual decrease in the H2O2 production rate (Fig.6a and b) suggests that the photocatalytic production of H2O2 is hampered by its decomposition at higher concentrations of H2O2. Therefore, the role of RGO in the photocatalytic decomposition of H2O2 must be considered. Fig.6c demonstrates the effect of RGO incorporation into the hybrid on the photocatalytic decomposition of H2O2.While RGO had a positive effect on the production rate, the presence of RGO did not significantly change the decomposition rate of H2O2 under sunlight irradiation (Fig.6c). Specifically, the photocatalytic decomposition of H2O2 after 1h irradiation was 6.4% (CdS) and 10.2% (CdS-G2). We further separately evaluated the rate constants for H2O2 formation (k f; μMmin−1) and decomposition (k d; min−1) by assuming zero-order and first-order kinetics, respectively [18,20]: (5) [ H 2 O 2 ] = K f K d { 1 - exp ( - K d t ) } . Values of k f and k d were estimated by fitting the data in Fig.6a–c) to Eq. (5), and the results are presented in Fig.6d. The k f value increased significantly after incorporation of RGO and reached a maximum in the CdS-G2 hybrid, which represents an almost sixfold enhancement compared with CdS (from 0.054 to 0.309μMmin−1). The k d value of the CdS-G2 hybrid increased only by 50% (from 0.0011 to 0.0017min−1). This result indicates that RGO mainly catalyzes the formation of H2O2, and not its decomposition, even though decomposition was not very high in the hybrid photocatalyst due to the presence of a large surface area. A plausible mechanism for the CdS-RGO photocatalyzed generation of H2O2 is shown in Scheme 1 . Bandgap excitation of the hybrid generates electron–hole pairs in the CB and VB, respectively. Then water is oxidized by holes to form H2O2 and protons. Oxygen molecules are spontaneously reduced by electrons to form superoxide radicals (step 1), which further react with protons (generated during water oxidation) to produce OH2 radicals (step 2). The OH2 radicals can readily undergo further reduction with e− (step 3), producing HO2 − anions. Finally, as demonstrated in step 4, the negatively charged HO2 − reacts with H+, leading to the evolution of the final H2O2 product [33]. As shown in Scheme 1, the H2O2 formation reaction consists of water oxidation and O2 reduction. To clarify the activity of these half reactions, we carried out a reaction with AgNO3, which is an often-used electron trapper. No detectable H2O2 is produced in the solution after 6h of sunlight irradiation. Another reaction was also performed with ethanol as a hole trapping reagents. The amount of H2O2 formed was 116μM, which is almost comparable with the amount of H2O2 formed under O2-equilibrated conditions without ethanol. This result suggests the pivotal role of generated electrons and indicates that O2 reduction is the rate-determining step for H2O2 formation. The perfect CB level of the hybrid facilitates the O2 reduction reaction and promotes H2O2 formation. To understand the effect of O2, we further carried out the production of H2O2 in air and under N2, separately. The amount of H2O2 formed in air was approximately 12μM (Fig. S3, Supplementary Information). This is almost 10-fold less than that the amount of H2O2 formed under O2-equilibrated conditions (128μM). However, no H2O2 was detected under N2. These results indicate that the O2-equilibrated condition is essential for H2O2 formation, because the O2 reduction is mainly responsible for the formation of H2O2. Next, the pH effect on CdS-G2 photocatalyzed H2O2 formation was studied. Fig.9 a shows photocatalyzed H2O2 generation in solutions of varying pH at 25°C. Interestingly, the production of H2O2 is enhanced with decreasing solution pH in spite of the fact that H2O2 can undergo a disproportionation reaction under acidic conditions. Strikingly, the concentration of produced H2O2 reaches 156μM at pH 2. The production of H2O2 is highly dependent on the pH because the formation of H2O2 is governed by the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) (as shown in Scheme 1, steps 2 and 4) [19]. This observation further confirms that the O2 reduction is primarily responsible for the production of H2O2. If water oxidation mainly occurred, then increasing the concentration of H+ would decrease the photocatalytic production of H2O2 [30]. However, it is found that the H2O2 concentration increases with the H+ concentration. The effect of the reaction temperature on CdS-G2 photocatalyzed H2O2 formation was also investigated. Fig.9b shows the time-dependent response for H2O2 generation at 10 and 25°C in the presence of the CdS-G2 hybrid. In typical chemical reactions, the rate of reaction increases with increasing reaction temperature. However, in the present system, the rate of H2O2 formation significantly increases with a decrease in the reaction temperature, as the concentration of produced H2O2 reaches 164μM at 10°C. The ultimate production of H2O2 increases because the k d decreases with decreasing reaction temperature [34]. The H2O2 production efficiency of the CdS-G2 photocatalyst has been compared with that of the reported photocatalyst in organic electron donor free condition (Table S1, Supplementary Information). This shows that the efficiency of the CdS-G2 is higher than that of the other photocatalysts. To check the recyclability of the as-prepared photocatalyst, the photocatalytic production of H2O2 was repeated for up to four cycles under the same conditions (Fig.10 ). After four cycles, the photocatalyst still maintains high photocatalytic activity for H2O2 production. In addition, the crystal structure and morphology of the photocatalyst remain almost the same after the photocatalytic reaction, as shown in Figs. S4 and S5 (Supplementary Information). These results indicate that CdS-RGO can serve as a stable and reusable photocatalyst for H2O2 production from an oxygen/water solution. An XPS analysis of used catalysts was also performed and is shown in Fig. S6 (Supplementary Information). There is no significant change between the XPS curves of pristine and used CdS-G3. This suggests that the present process does not seriously oxidize RGO or CdS (self-oxidation S2)."
9,Conclusions,"In this work, we demonstrated the safe and eco-friendly production of H2O2 from O2 and H2O by a CdS-based heterogeneous catalyst under sunlight. The studied photocatalytic process possesses a number of significant advantages: (1) noble metal-free catalyst, (2) organic-electron-donor-free conditions, (3) energy from sunlight (no-cost light source), and (4) earth-abundant resources such as water and O2. The presence of RGO in the photocatalyst played a critical role in enhancing the efficiency of H2O2 production by retarding charge recombination and shuttling CB electrons. The concentration of produced H2O2 can be increased to 164μM through the control of reaction temperature and solution pH and the incorporation of RGO. This is a significant improvement over the reported photocatalytic production of H2O2. The photocatalytic production of H2O2 follows a mechanism involving the two-electron reduction of O2. This work shows the potential of CdS-based photocatalysts for use with sunlight for different applications, such as the synthesis of commodity chemicals, water-splitting, and environmental remediation."
