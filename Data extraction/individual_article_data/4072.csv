0,Introduction,"In contrast to water under normal conditions or steam, supercritical water (SCW, T ≥647.2K, P ≥22.1MPa) is miscible with most organic compounds, which makes rapid homogeneous organic chemical reactions possible [1,2]. Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) [3,4], which extracts hydrogen as a clean energy carrier from biomass, particularly from organic waste or wastewater [5–9], has attracted much attention due to its increasingly significant roles in environmental protection and energy renewal. The process of SCWG can be described as a steam reforming reaction (1), water–gas shift reaction (2) and methanation reaction ((3) and (4)) [10,11]. Reactions (1) and (2) indicate that the water acts not only as a solvent but also as a reactant in the SCWG process, because some of the hydrogen atoms in the gaseous products originate from water molecules [12–14]: (1) C H n O m + ( 1 − m ) H 2 O → n 2 + 1 − m H 2 + CO (2) CO + H 2 O → C O 2 + H 2 , Δ H 298 θ = − 41 kJ / mol (3) CO + 3 H 2 → C H 4 + H 2 O, Δ H 298 θ = − 211 kJ / mol (4) C O 2 + 4 H 2 → C H 4 + 2 H 2 O, Δ H 298 θ = − 223 kJ / mol The reaction chemistry and phase behavior of polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate and lignin in SCW have been investigated in detail by Fang et al. [15–17]. The main advantages of wet biomass gasification in SCW for hydrogen production have been summarized by Kruse et al. [18] and Gasafi et al. [19]. The main disadvantages of SCWG are the initial investment required and the operational costs [20,21]. Matsumura [22] compared the costs for hydrogen production by SCWG with those for biomethanation from wet biomass and found that the extraction of hydrogen using SCWG is more expensive than that using biomethanation. To reduce the cost of SCWG a modified SCWG process, catalytic supercritical water gasification (CSCWG), was developed [23–39]. The use of α-Al2O3, ZrO2 or TiO2 catalysts supported by Ni, Ru or Rh for the gasification of organic compounds in a high-pressure aqueous environment has been reported by Elliott et al. [23–25]. The authors [26,27] showed that ZrO2 is an acid–base catalyst that can turn into an almost pure monoclinic structure after the SCWG reaction, and that the methanation reaction can be restrained by ZrO2. Therefore, the H2 yield with ZrO2 is twice that without catalyst in the SCWG of glucose and cellulose [28,29]. The reduced Ni was also applied in the SCWG process of cellulose, but its activity was significantly affected by the support [31–35]. More recently, a Ni wire has been used as a catalyst for the SCWG of phenol [4,36]. The results obtained showed that the phenol was completely decomposed in 10min with Ni wire while the removal rate of phenol was only 68% after 1h in the absence of Ni wire. A challenge associated with the catalysts, however, is achieving stability in catalytic activity. Sato at al. [37] and Furusawa et al. [38,39] have reported that the catalytic activity of 10%Ni/MgO is the best in the CSCWG of lignin with Ni/MgO, but deactivation of the catalyst occurs after three runs. Although the ZrO2 can act as a catalyst as well as a stable support [23–25,28,29], synergistic catalysis may arise in the CSCWG when the active components are loaded on the ZrO2. Unfortunately, there are hardly any reports addressing this issue, so it needs to be investigated. Polyethylene glycol (PEG, HO(CH2CH2O) n H) is an important group of non-ionic synthetic water-soluble polymers that has been widely used in the industrial production of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, lubricants and also as an antifreeze for automobile radiators [40]. Millions of tons of PEG have been manufactured worldwide over the past decades and a great deal of PEG is being discharged in wastewater. However, the biodegradation of PEG is very difficult. Huang et al. [41] have reported that only 80% and 40% of PEG 6000 was degraded in 5 and 10 days under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. The complete degradation of PEG is extremely difficult, even by wet air oxidation [40,42]. Therefore, an effective method to degrade PEG wastewater needs to be established. In this study, hydrogen production from PEG wastewater by CSCWG using Ni, Co and W as catalytic components and ZrO2 as a support was investigated in a continuous flow Inconel 625 reactor at 663K, 24MPa and at residence times from 60s to 300s. The activity, selectivity and stability of the catalysts were discussed."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All chemicals and materials were of analytical grade and were used without any further treatment. PEG 6000, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 5(NH4)2O·12WO3·5H2O were purchased from Guangzhou Chemical Reagent Factory, China. ZrO2 powder (diameter of 1μm) was purchased from Guangdong Orient Zirconic Sci. and Tech. Co., Ltd., China. PEG dissolved in de-ionized water was used to simulate the PEG-contaminated wastewater. In this study, the feedstock concentration of PEG was 2.0g/L."
3,Preparation of catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of catalysts The catalysts were prepared by impregnating ZrO2 powder into aqueous solutions of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 5(NH4)2O·12WO3·5H2O). These materials were then pressed to form tablets with a diameter of 5mm and a height of 1mm, and then dried at 378K for 10h. The tablet-shaped catalysts were calcined at 5K/min to 773K and held at 773K for 5h, and then the samples of catalysts were obtained."
4,Apparatus,"2.3 Apparatus The experiments were performed using a continuous flow SCWG reactor configured by Supercritical Fluids Technology Inc. (SFT, USA). The reactor is resistant to the high temperature of 773K and high pressure of 31MPa. As shown in Fig. 1 , the equipment includes a feed system, a heat-reaction system, a condensation-separation system and a backpressure regulator. The feed system is composed of two HPLC pumps (Prep-100, 100.0ml/min, 34.5MPa and Prep-24, 24.0ml/min, 34.5MPa, Scientific Systems Inc.) and one gas compressor (AG-75, 300.0L/h, 31.0MPa, Haskel International Inc.). The P1, with a 0–100.0ml/min flow rate, feeds the organic stocks and supplies the system pressure to a range of 0–31MPa. When oxidant is needed, the P2 which has a 0–24.0ml/min flow rate can feed H2O2 and the compressor can pump O2 or air. The preheater (i.d. 51.0mm, length 154.0mm, 314.4ml) and reactor (i.d. 31.8mm, length 334.0mm, 265.1ml) are made by Inconel 625 and are equipped with 5.5kW and 3.5kW furnaces, respectively. The temperatures of the preheater and reactor are controlled by four K-type thermocouples and one temperature controller (2416, Eurotherm). An Inconel 625 basket (o.d. 31.7mm, length 317.5mm, 150 mesh) for the catalyst loading that can be removed very conveniently is positioned in the reactor. Two filled columns (o.d. and length of 31.5mm and 317.5mm, i.d. of 20.0mm and 12.0mm, respectively) are used to adjust the reactor volume. The condenser is made of 316 SS. The system pressure is regulated by a backpressure regulator (BadgerMeter Inc.), which can regulate the system pressure through the pressure transducer and controller (2416, Eurotherm)."
5,Procedure,"2.4 Procedure First, the reactor temperature was increased to 373K to dry the reactor before starting the experiments. Then the basket loaded with 90g of catalyst was placed in the reactor. At the same time, N2 (99.99%) was used to purge the oxygen at 20.0L/h by compressor. The furnace of the reactor was then turned on, and the N2 was switched to H2 (99.99%) with a flow rate of 10.0L/h when the temperature and pressure of the reactor reached 753K and 1MPa, respectively. After this, the deoxidization of the catalysts started, and the reactor was maintained at 753K and 1MPa for 3h. After this period of time, the heating was stopped and H2 was switched to N2 with a flow rate of 20.0L/h. The N2 supply was maintained until the reactor temperature decreased to 373K by convection, and then the deoxidization of the catalysts was finished. De-ionized water was then pumped to the reactor and the furnaces of the preheater and the reactor were turned on. The feedstock was introduced when the system temperature and pressure reached the experimental conditions. The liquid and gas were sampled after the reaction had stabilized for 1h."
6,Gas and liquid analysis,"2.5 Gas and liquid analysis The gaseous effluent was sampled from the gas–liquid separator and immediately analyzed on a GC-900A gas chromatograph (Shanghai Kechuang Chromatograph Instruments Co., Ltd.) with a thermal conductivity detector (GC/TCD) for H2, O2, CO2, CO, CH4, and N2. A C-2000 column, 3.0m long and 3.0mm in diameter was used (Chromatographic Technology R&D Center, Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, CAS). Argon was used as the carrier gas. The column oven was held at 423K for the composition analysis, and both the injector oven and the detector oven were operated at 383K. The gas flow rate was measured with a wet gas flow meter. The total organic carbon (TOC) concentration of the stream was measured on a 1020A TOC analyzer (OI analytical, USA). Organic acids in liquid products were analyzed by ion chromatography (IC, ICS-1000, Dionex, USA). Other organic compounds in liquid products were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS, QP 2010, Shimadzu, Japan) using a DB25 capillary column (30m×0.25mm×0.25μm). The column temperature was initially set at 313K for 5min, followed by a linear temperature increase of 10K/min to 423K; it was held at this temperature for 2min, and then increased at 5K/min to 553K, where it was held for 3min."
7,Catalyst testing,"2.6 Catalyst testing XRD (X-ray diffraction) measurements of the catalysts were performed on a D/max-IIIA X diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation, 30kV tube voltage, and 30mA current. The XRD patterns were taken in the 2θ range of 5–75° at a scan speed of 10°/min. XRF (X-ray fluorescence) measurements of catalysts were performed using Xious-DY878 (PANalytical Inc.) to calculate the amount of Ni loading on the catalysts. N2-adsorption isotherms of the samples were measured using an ASAP2010 (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation) apparatus to calculate the specific surface area based on the BET method. Temperature programmed reduction by hydrogen (H2-TPR) was carried out in a tubular quartz reactor (inner diameter 5mm), which was coupled to a TCD detector for monitoring H2 consumption. Water from desorption or formed from reaction was removed by a membrane before entering the TCD detector. The experiments were conducted by heating the fresh samples (50mg) at 10K/min from room temperature to 1073K in a 30ml/min flow of 5vol.% H2 in Ar. CuO was used as a calibration reference to quantify the total amount of H2 consumed during the experiments."
8,Evaluation of the SCWG efficiency,"2.7 Evaluation of the SCWG efficiency The efficiency of organic compound destruction and gasification in the SCWG of PEG was evaluated in terms of gas yield, TOC removal ratio (R TOC), carbon gasification ratio (R CG) and hydrogen gasification ratio (R HG). The gas yields was defined as (5) gas yields ( H 2 , CO , C H 4 or C O 2 ) = G × V 22.4 × f × C where gas yields is the molar amount of H2, CO, CH4 or CO2 produced per g PEG (mmol/g), G is the H2, CO, CH4 or CO2 molar fraction of gaseous product (%), V is the gas flow rate (ml/s), f is the feedstock flow rate (ml/s), C is the PEG concentration (g/ml). The R TOC was defined as (6) R TOC ( % ) = M TO C i n − M TO C o u t M TO C i n × 100 where M TO C i n is the TOC of the feed solution (mg/L), M TO C o u t is the TOC of the outflow (mg/L). The R CG and R HG were defined as (7) R CG ( % ) = C PG C OC × 100 (8) R HG ( % ) = H PG H OC × 100 where C PG is the carbon amount in the gaseous products produced from 1.0g PEG (mmol/g PEG), C OC is the carbon amount in organic compounds (mmol/g PEG), H PG is the hydrogen amount in the gaseous product which was produced from 1.0g PEG (mmol/g PEG) and H OC is the hydrogen amount in organic compounds (mmol/g PEG). The residence time is calculated according to the flow rate of the feed solution and the density of the water under the reaction conditions as follows: (9) τ = V R × ρ W F × ρ 0 where τ is the residence time (s), V R is the volume of the reactor not containing any catalyst (i.e. the volume of the reactor minus the volume of catalyst in it) (m3), ρ W is the density of water at reaction conditions (kg/m3), ρ 0 is the density of water (kg/m3) and F is the flow rate of feedstock at temperature of 293K and atmospheric pressure (m3/s)."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Catalyst reduction and gasification,"3.1 Catalyst reduction and gasification To investigate the catalytic reduction of PEG, the gas yields and gasification efficiency by the SCWG process without catalyst, with ZrO2, with NiO/ZrO2 and with Ni/ZrO2 as catalysts are compared at 663K, 24MPa with a residence time of 180s in Figs. 2 and 3 . The results show that the catalytic activity of NiO/ZrO2 was the same as that of ZrO2, indicating that NiO has no catalytic activity at these experiment conditions. The H2 yields decreased in the following order: Ni/ZrO2, ZrO2, NiO/ZrO2. Thus the reduction of NiO as the active component on the ZrO2 support was necessary. The H2-TPR profiles of the NiO/ZrO2 catalyst are shown in Fig. 4 . An apex was formed at 670K. These results show that the NiO/ZrO2 could be reduced completely by H2 at 753K for 3h. As shown in Fig. 2, the H2 content in the gaseous products exceeded 50%. In contrast, Sato et al. [37] found that CH4 rather than H2 was the main gaseous product in the CSCWG process of lignin with Ni/MgO catalyst because the methanation reaction was promoted by the Ni and the H2 was consumed. The results obtained in the present work might be attributed to the ZrO2 support which can restrain the methanation reaction [27–29]. As shown in Fig. 5 , the CH4 mole fraction present in the gaseous products was in the order: without catalyst>Ni/ZrO2 >ZrO2. This implies that the methanation reaction was inhibited by ZrO2. Moreover, the H2 yield with ZrO2 catalysis was 2.7 times higher than that without catalyst, which suggests that the gasification reaction could be promoted by the ZrO2. This observation is consistent with the results of Watanabe et al. [27,28]. Therefore the difference in the main gaseous products between reference [37] and this study was due to the different supports. Figs. 2 and 3 present the gas yields and gasification efficiency of the SCWG process during the degradation of PEG with various activated component catalysts at 663K, 24MPa, 180s. The gaseous products include H2, CO, CH4 and CO2. Fig. 2 shows that the H2 yields with no catalyst, 90g ZrO2, 15%Ni/ZrO2, 15%Co/ZrO2, 15%W/ZrO2, 5%Co15%Ni/ZrO2 and 5%W15%Ni/ZrO2 catalysts are 6.2mmol/g, 15.6mmol/g, 14.3mmol/g, 37.2mmol/g, 28.5mmol/g, 14.7mmol/g, 50.2mmol/g and 43.9mmol/g, respectively at 663K, 24MPa, 180s. The H2 yields with 15%Ni/ZrO2 are 6.1 and 2.4 times higher than those without catalyst and with ZrO2, respectively. The H2 yields with 15%Ni/ZrO2, 15%Co/ZrO2 and 15%W/ZrO2 indicate that the activity of Ni is higher than those of Co and W. However, the H2 yield with 15%W/ZrO2 was similar to that with ZrO2, which indicates that the W is not an active metal. Furusawa et al. [38] also reported that the catalytic activity of Ni was higher than that of Co in the CSCWG of lignin when using Ni and Co as active components and MgO as the support. The catalytic activity of 15%Ni/ZrO2 was enhanced when Co or W was added as a promoter of Ni, which implies that a synergistic effect was produced even though the W/ZrO2 had no more catalytic activity than the ZrO2 alone. The gasification efficiency of all catalysts, as shown in Fig. 3, suggest the following catalytic activity order: 5%Co15%Ni/ZrO2 >5%W15%Ni/ZrO2 >15%Ni/ZrO2 >15%Co/ZrO2 >ZrO2 >15%W/ZrO2 >NiO/ZrO2. The liquid products obtained without catalyst and with 15%Ni/ZrO2 catalyst at 663K, 24MPa and at residence times from 60s to 300s were analyzed by IC and GC/MS. Both liquid products contained formic acid and acetic acid, according to IC analysis. Alcohol, ketone, ether and alkane products were found in the liquid products. Toluene was present in the liquid products obtained without catalyst but was not present in the liquid products obtained with 15%Ni/ZrO2 catalyst, suggesting that the Ni/ZrO2 catalyst not only promotes the gasification process but also inhibits the production of toxic substances."
11,Effect of Ni loading on gasification,"3.2 Effect of Ni loading on gasification As mentioned in the above section, the Ni/ZrO2 catalyst had higher activity than the Co/ZrO2 and W/ZrO2 catalysts. The effect of Ni loading (5%, 10% and 15%) on the gas yields and gasification efficiency was investigated at 663K, 24MPa, 60–300s. As shown in Table 1 , the H2 and CO2 yields increased with increasing residence times, whereas the CO and CH4 yields did not increase with an increasing residence time for any of the catalysts tested. The H2 yield reached maximum values of 34.0mmol/g, 41.8mmol/g and 56.9mmol/g with 5%, 10% and 15% Ni loading, respectively, at a residence time of 300s. All the R TOC, R CG and R HG values of the various Ni loadings increased with increasing residence time, and the R TOC, R CG and R HG values were 46.6%, 45.5% and 81.6% with 5% Ni loading, 52.6%, 51.5% and 98.7% with 10% Ni loading, and 65.2%, 64.4% and 135.8% with 15% Ni loading at a residence time of 300s. The increase in gas yields and gasification efficiency with increased Ni loading could be attributed to the promotion of catalytic activity with increasing numbers of active sites. Sato et al. [37] also found that the gas yields increased with an increasing Ni amount on Ni/MgO catalysts in the CSCWG of lignin."
12,Effect of catalyst amount on gasification,"3.3 Effect of catalyst amount on gasification Table 2 shows the effect of catalyst amount on the gas yields and gasification efficiency at 663K, 24MPa, 60–300s. The gasification results using 90g or 180g of Ni/ZrO2 catalysts were compared. The results showed that the amount of catalyst had little influence on the H2 fraction in the gaseous products. However, the CO and CH4 fractions decreased slightly and the CO2 fraction increased with the increase in catalyst amount, as can be seen in the gas compositions listed in Table 2. The CO and CH4 yields did not increase with an increasing catalyst amount. However, increasing the catalyst amount significantly enhanced the H2 yield and gasification efficiency. When the catalyst amount was increased twofold, the increase in H2 yield exceeded 20mmol/g and the R TOC and R CG values increased by 20–30%. These results show that the increase in the H2 yield resulted from the promotion of the gasification efficiency but not from the increase in the H2 fraction in the gaseous product. This can be attributed to the increased number of catalytic activity sites with a higher catalyst amount. The R TOC reached 87.6% with 180g catalyst at a residence time of 300s, showing that PEG was broken down readily by SCWG with a Ni/ZrO2 catalyst. No char or tar was found in the liquid products, showing that the decomposed organic compounds were completely converted to gaseous products, which supported by the difference between the value of R TOC and R CG was very small. The R HG reached 181.1% with 180g of catalyst at a residence time of 300s, which indicates that some of the hydrogen atoms in the gaseous products originated from the water molecules in terms of the definition of R HG in Eq. (8)."
13,Effect of PEG concentration on gasification,"3.4 Effect of PEG concentration on gasification Boukis et al. [10] found that the feed concentration had a great influence on the gas yield and that an increase in the feed concentration could inhibit the production of H2. The effect of the PEG concentration on gasification was investigated at 663K, 24MPa with a residence time of 180s. As shown in Fig. 6 , the H2, CO and CO2 yields decreased from 37.3mmol/g, 3.6mmol/g and 13.3mmol/g to 11.2mmol/g, 1.6mmol/g and 7.1mmol/g, respectively, but the CH4 yield increased from 3.4mmol/g to 6.5mmol/g when the PEG concentration was increased from 2g/L to 30g/L. The increase in the CH4 yield could be attributed to promotion of the methanation reaction (reactions (3) and (4)) in which H2, CO and CO2 would be consumed. Fig. 7 shows that the R TOC, R CG and R HG decreased from 49.5%, 48.5% and 96.7% to 37.6%, 36.7% and 53.4%, respectively. These results show that the increasing PEG concentration inhibits the gasification process."
14,Catalyst stability,"3.5 Catalyst stability For an ideal catalyst, both the activity and selectivity and the stability in the supercritical water are important [6,23–25,43]. The deactivation of 20%Ni/MgO catalyst was found to be caused by the presence of char-like carbonaceous products and the formation of an Mg(OH)2 phase without regeneration treatments. At the same time, the activity also dropped with the decrease in surface area when the regeneration treatment was carried out [39]. Osada [44] reported the deactivation of Ru/γ-A2O3 and Ru/C catalysts in the SCWG of lignin. In this study, the continuous SCWG reaction of PEG with 180g 15%Ni/ZrO2 catalyst was operated at 663K, 24MPa and 120s. The experiments were run continuously for about 85h. The results show that the gas yields and gasification efficiency did not change over this reaction time, which suggests that the catalysts were stable for 85h during the reaction. The fresh and used catalysts were analyzed by BET, XRF and XRD. The surface areas of the Ni/ZrO2 catalyst before and after gasification were 20.9m2/g and 21.5m2/g, respectively. The XRF analysis shows that the Ni contents of fresh and used catalysts were 14.6% and 14.3%, respectively, indicating almost no loss of Ni in the process of gasification. As shown by the XRD profiles of pure ZrO2, fresh Ni/ZrO2 catalysts and used Ni/ZrO2 catalysts in Fig. 8 , the structures did not change after the gasification in supercritical water. Therefore, the Ni/ZrO2 catalyst had a good stability in the SCWG process."
15,Conclusions,"The CSCWG of PEG-contaminated wastewater for hydrogen production was investigated with ZrO2, NiO/ZrO2, Ni/ZrO2, Co/ZrO2, W/ZrO2, 5%Co15%Ni/ZrO2 and 5%W15%Ni/ZrO2 as catalysts at 663K and 24MPa and at residence times from 60s to 300s. The results show that the activity was in the following order: 5%Co15%Ni/ZrO2 >5%W15%Ni/ZrO2 >15%Ni/ZrO2 >15%Co/ZrO2 >ZrO2 >15%W/ZrO2 >NiO/ZrO2. The H2-TPR results of the Ni/ZrO2 demonstrate that the NiO/ZrO2 could be reduced at 753K. The methanation reaction could be restrained by the presence of ZrO2. A synergistic effect was found when Co or W was added into the 15%Ni/ZrO2 catalyst. Increases in both the Ni loading and the catalyst amount improved the gas yields and gasification efficiency, which was probably caused by the increase in active sites. An increase in the PEG concentration decreased the gas yield and gasification efficiency. The catalyst stability was tested with 180g Ni/ZrO2 by continuous operation over 85h at 663K, 24MPa and 120s. The results suggest that the gas yields and gasification efficiency remained unchanged in the gasification process. The XRD, BET and XRF analyses show that the crystal structure, surface area and Ni loading of Ni/ZrO2 were almost the same before and after the gasification. The results of the liquid products analyses suggest that the Ni/ZrO2 catalyst could inhibit the production of toxic intermediates. The Ni/ZrO2 catalyst is therefore a promising heterogeneous catalyst for hydrogen production in a SCWG process with high activity and stability."
