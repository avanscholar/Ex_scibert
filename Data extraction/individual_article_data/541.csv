0,Introduction,"Due to the fast depletion of fossil fuels and environmental concerns about climate change, biomass is expected to become an increasingly important feedstock for the production of fuels and chemicals [1–4]. Furfural is one of the prospective platform molecules in the biorefinery approach. It can be readily produced from xylan, which is contained in the hemicellulose part of lignocellulosic biomass [5–10]. Selective hydrogenation of furfural has attracted much attention for the production of furfuryl alcohol, methyl furan, and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol [10–15]. These reactions are typically catalyzed by mono- or bimetallic catalysts, usually comprising Cu, Pd, Ru and Pt. Furfuryl alcohol is widely used in the fine chemicals and polymer industry, for instance in the production of thermostatic resins, acid proof bricks, corrosion resistant fiber glass, lysine, vitamin C, and lubricants [16,17]. Perez and Fraga reported the one-step production of furfuryl alcohol from xylose over a two-catalyst system, containing Pt/SiO2 and sulfated ZrO2 as the metal and acid components, respectively [10]. The selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol is challenging, because the product can be further hydrogenated into tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and, also, because furfuryl alcohol can polymerize [10,18]. Therefore, alternative catalytic approaches are being explored. It has, for instance, been reported that the liquid phase hydrogenation of furfural catalyzed by an amorphous NiB alloy, Pt and Pd catalysts brings significant advantages [19–24]. The use of water as a solvent decreases the pollution of the environment. An inherent problem associated with water as solvent is that high reaction temperatures and high H2 pressure are needed to achieve appreciable activity because of the low solubility of hydrogen in water [25]. Very recently, Chen et al. succeeded in hydrogenating furfural by Ru clusters confined in nano-sized mesoporous zirconium-silica in water at room temperature [26]. This result constitutes a new approach for the production of furfuryl alcohol by using supported Ru nanoparticles. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are comprised of networks of metal centers or inorganic clusters bridged by simple organic linkers through metal-ligand coordination bonds [27]. They have already found applications in catalysis, namely as catalyst and as support [28–31]. Compared with conventional porous inorganic materials, MOFs show strong host-guest interaction between the framework and metal nanoparticles via coordination and π–π forces [31]. Such interactions may enhance the catalytic activity. Such synergetic effects depend on the MOF structure and its electronic properties [32–37]. Inspired by these works, we incorporated Ru nanoparticles into several MOFs with the purpose of developing a selective hydrogenation catalyst with applications in biomass conversion. Schroder and co-workers embedded Ru nanoparticles inside the cavities of porous MOF-5 by hydrogenolysis of adsorbed Ru(COD)(COT) (COD-1,5-cyclooctadiene; COT-1,3,5-cyclooctatriene) [37]. The low stability of MOF-5 in water limits its practical application in water-mediated catalysis. In contrast, zirconium based MOFs (Zr-MOFs) are more stable in solvents such as water, acetone, dimethylformanide, and benzene [38]. Therefore, Zr-MOFs are promising materials as catalysts and catalyst supports [39,40]. There are very few reports about the performance of Zr-MOFs as supports for metal nanoparticles hydrogenation catalysts [41–43]. In this study, we synthesized two series of Zr-based MOFs, namely UiO (UiO-66, UiO-67, and Zr6-NDC) and the A, B, and C variants of MIL-140 [44–46] by using different organic linkers such as 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (BDC), 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid (NDC), and 4,4'-biphenyldicarboxylic acid (BPDC). Ru nanoparticles were loaded on these materials and their activities for the hydrogenation of furfural at room temperature were investigated. The results indicate that Ru nanoparticles show excellent selectivity to furfuryl alcohol, with Ru/UiO-66 and Ru/UiO-67 showing the highest catalytic performance. The hydrogenation activity can be linked to the presence of metallic Ru nanoparticles."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of metal-organic frameworks,"2.1 Synthesis of metal-organic frameworks All materials were prepared according to literature [38,44–46]. In some cases, HCl or acetic acid was added to improve the crystallization rate. The typical synthesis conditions of all materials including precursor, temperature and reaction period are listed in Table 1 . As an example, the synthesis of UiO-66 is described: 1mmol of ZrCl4 and 1mmol of 1, 4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (BDC) were dissolved in 100mL of DMF at room temperature. The mixture was poured in a Teflon-lined stainless steel reactor and placed in a preheated oven at 120°C for 24h to crystallize the MOF under static conditions. The resulting solids were filtered, repeatedly washed with dimethylformamide (DMF) and methanol, and dried at room temperature in vacuum. All materials have been heated at 100°C under vacuum to remove the residue solvents prior to characterization."
3,Preparation of Ru/Zr-MOF,"2.2 Preparation of Ru/Zr-MOF The supported Ru catalysts were prepared by deposition-reduction of Ru on the Zr-MOFs. Typically, 2.24mL of RuCl3 solution (Ru: 13.4mg/mL) was diluted into 60mL of deionized water. Then, 0.97g of vacuum-dried support was added to the RuCl3 solution and thoroughly stirred for 4h. In order to reduce the Ru precursor, 100μL of N2H4žH2O was added. The solid was filtered and dried at 70°C under vacuum overnight. The catalysts were pretreated in flowing H2 at 200°C for 2h and cooled to room temperature in flowing nitrogen. The catalyst was stored in air under ambient conditions."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5405Å) operated at 35kV and 25mA. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken on a FEI Tecnai G2 F30 microscope operated at 300kV. The Ru loading was determined by a Thermo Elemental IRIS Intrepid II XSP inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). Prior to analysis, an amount of catalyst was dissolved in 10mL of royal water by heating in an autoclave at 180°C for 6h. H2-TPR experiments were performed on a XianQuan (Tianjing) TP-5078 TPR/TPD analyzer equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). About 70mg of sample was placed in a quartz tubular reactor and pretreated in a He stream, heated to 200°C at a rate of 10°C/min, and held at this temperature for 60min. After cooling to room temperature, a gaseous mixture of 5% H2 in Ar was fed at a flow rate of 30mL/min and the sample temperature was increased to 150°C with ramp rate of 10°C/min. To determine the reduction degree of the Ru phase under relevant reaction conditions, we have carried out XPS measurements of Ru/UiO-66 and Ru/MIL-140C samples after quasi in-situ reduction. The Ru catalyst was placed in an air-tight glass tube reactor and exposed to flowing H2 (100ml/min) at room temperature or 120°C for 10min. After the reactor was cooled to ambient temperature, the glass reactor was flushed by He, sealed, and transferred to a N2-flushed glove box. Samples were prepared in the glovebox on double-sided carbon tape and were transferred under vacuum to the XPS apparatus via a sealed transfer vessel, preventing exposure to air. The spectra were recorded on a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha spectrometer, equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6eV, 72W) and a hemispherical analyzer with a 128-channel detector. Survey scans were recorded at constant pass energy of 200eV and more detailed region scans at a constant pass energy of 50eV. The background pressure was 2×10−9 mbar. XP spectra were fitted with the CASA-XPS software. Spectra were calibrated by the C 1 s peak located at 284.8eV. The binding energy (BE) and atomic ratios of Ru species were determined from the Ru 3d and 3p region-scan spectra. The Ru 3p spectra were analyzed to support and increase reliability of the Ru 3d analysis due to overlap of the Ru 3d3/2 peak (284eV) with the C 1s peak of the MOF support [47,48]."
5,Catalytic activity measurements,"2.4 Catalytic activity measurements A Teflon-lined (120mL) steel batch reactor was used to carry out the liquid phase hydrogenation reactions. An amount of 100mg of as-prepared catalyst was loaded into the reactor with 9.9mL of H2O and 100μL of furfural. The reactor was purged five times with H2 and then pressurized with 5bar H2. The reaction vessel was kept at room temperature (20°C) and stirred for 4h. The products were diluted with ethanol and analyzed on a Tianmei 7900 GC equipped with a DM-FFAP capillary column (30 m length, 0.25μm film thickness and 0.25mm internal diameter). In all cases, furfuryl alcohol was observed as the only product. By variation of the stirring speed, it was verified that there were no diffusional limitations during the catalytic tests."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of Zr-MOFs,"3.1 Characterization of Zr-MOFs Two series of Zr-based MOFs were prepared, namely UiO (UiO-66, UiO-67 and Zr6-NDC) and MIL-140 (A, B, and C), using different organic linkers including BDC, NDC, and BPDC. Fig. 1 A displays the XRD patterns of the activated materials. UiO-66 and UiO-67 share the same crystal structure. The synthesis of Zr6-NDC was not successful, as XRD shows that no crystalline product was obtained. The three MIL-140 materials are all crystalline and their patterns correspond to published data [44]. Nitrogen physisorption was used to determine the BET surface areas (Fig. 2 A). The surface areas of all materials (Table 1) are close to reported values for similar materials [44–46]. Their thermal stability upon calcination in air was investigated by TGA and the results are shown in Fig. 3 . The TG curves show two weight-loss steps. The first one at temperature below 300°C can be attributed to the removal of adsorbed water or condensation of hydroxyl bonds at the Zr nodes. The amount of physisorbed water relates to the framework structure and organic linker groups, as also observed in previous studies on MIL-53 and MIL-101 [35]. The second loss at temperatures close to 500°C is due to the combustion of the organic part of the MOF structure. These results indicate that well-crystallized Zr-based MOFs are thermally stable at temperatures as high as 470°C due to the strong bonding between the Zr nodes and carboxylic groups. It should be noted that Zr6-NDC decomposed at slightly lower temperature of 450°C, probably because of its amorphous structure."
8,Characterization of Ru/Zr-MOFs,"3.2 Characterization of Ru/Zr-MOFs Loading metal nanoparticles on MOFs is challenging, because aggregation of nanoparticles usually leads to the collapse of the long-range crystalline order of the MOF. Fig. 1B shows the XRD patterns of the Zr-MOFs after loading of Ru. The results indicate that UiO-66 and the three MIL-140 materials retain their crystalline structure. The long-range order of UiO-67 collapsed after RuCl3 impregnation and reduction, indicating its lower chemical stability compared with the other materials. The BET surface areas from the physisorption isotherms of the Ru catalysts (Fig. 2B) are listed in Table 2 . The surface areas are lower as compared with the parent samples, which points to a small loss in crystallinity due to Ru loading. However, the surface areas of Zr6-NDC and UiO-67 decreased more substantially upon Ru loading, consistent with the loss of crystallinity for UiO-67. No diffraction lines attributable to Ru nanoparticles were observed in the XRD patterns, suggesting high dispersion of the Ru particles. The Ru loading of the catalysts was in the range 2.4–3.2wt%. The Ru-containing MOFs were further characterized by HRTEM and H2-TPR. Fig. 4 shows typical HRTEM images of Ru/Zr-MOFs. Except for Ru/MIL-140C, all catalysts contain Ru nanoparticles with sizes in the range of 1–4nm. The Ru dispersion in Ru/MIL-140C is likely very high, because no Ru nanoparticles could be discerned in the TEM images. Fig. 5 shows the H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) of the Ru species below 150°C. A significant H2 consumption peak centered at about 80°C was observed for all catalysts. Previous studies of H2-TPR on supported Ru catalysts showed that oxidized Ru species can be partly reduced at temperatures below 150°C, yet full reduction requires at least 300°C [49,50]. Interestingly, the H2 consumption substantially varies when normalized on the amount of Ru. The H/Ru ratios of Ru/UiO-66, Ru/MIL-140A, Ru/Zr6-NDC, Ru/MIL-140B, Ru/UiO-67, and Ru/MIL-140C are 1.2, 0.58, 0.66, 1.2, 0.78, and 0.23, respectively. These results suggest that oxidized Ru species were present in the freshly prepared Ru catalysts. These catalysts were reduced by hydrazine and hydrogen, but air exposure has led to their re-oxidation. The reducibility of the Ru species supported on the different MOF supports varies upon H2 reduction. We studied by XPS the stability of these oxidic Ru species in a reducing hydrogen atmosphere at room temperature and at 120°C for the Ru/UiO-66 and Ru/MIL-140C samples. For each sample, the Ru 3d and 3p spectra were fitted and the results are in good agreement (Table 3 ). The fitted Ru 3d XP spectra of Ru/UiO-66 and Ru/MIL-140C are shown in Fig. 6 . Two RuOx species were found in fresh Ru/UiO-66, located at 281.2eV and 282.9eV (Ru 3d5/2). The feature at 281.2eV can be ascribed to RuO2, whereas the nature of the feature at 282.9eV has been ascribed to unscreened RuO2 [51,52], hydrated RuO2 (RuO2·xH2O) [53,54] or RuO3 [55,56]. Since Ru6+ is not stable, we ascribe the feature at 282.9eV to Ru4+, present either as unscreened or hydrated RuO2. After reduction at room temperature, the metallic Ru content is about 30%. This result implies that the H/Ru ratios determined by H2-TPR should be considered with care, as the RuOx phase can already be partially reduced during room temperature exposure to hydrogen. When Ru/UiO-66 is reduced at 120°C, all the Ru is reduced according to XPS. The XP spectra of Ru/MIL-140C were fitted with one RuOx contribution at 282.2eV, approximately 1eV higher than Ru/UiO-66. We propose that the increased binding energy is caused by an increased dispersion of RuO2 and interaction with the organic linkers of the MOF. This is supported by the absence of visible Ru particles in the TEM images of Ru/MIL140C. Upon reduction at room temperature or 120°C, Ru remains predominantly in the oxidic state. This finding is consistent with the TPR data, which indicates that the Ru-oxide phase is hardly reduced at 120°C. This deviant behavior of Ru/MIL-140C confirms that the oxidic Ru species of Ru/MIL-140C cannot be reduced under the reaction conditions, mostly likely because of their strong interaction with the carboxylic acid groups of the supporting MOF structure [57]. Strong interactions of Ru with oxygen containing functional groups of the support can hinder the reduction, as for instance also observed for activated carbon supported Ru [58]. We speculate that the variation in oxidic Ru content in our Ru/Zr-MOFs relates to differences in the content of free carboxylic groups."
9,Catalytic activity measurements,"3.3 Catalytic activity measurements Furfural hydrogenation was carried out in water at room temperature at a H2 pressure of 0.5MPa. The conversion and turnover frequency (TOF) based on the number of moles of furfural converted per mole of Ru per hour are given in Table 4 . In all cases, furfuryl alcohol was observed as the only product. The activity order was (TOF between brackets): Ru/UiO-66 (11) ≈Ru/UiO-67 (11) >Ru/Zr-NDC (8.0) ≈Ru/MIL-140B (5.1), Ru/MIL-140A (4.8) >Ru/MIL-140C (2.1). Ru/UiO-66 showed the highest activity with a furfural conversion of 94.9% and a TOF of 11h−1. The catalytic performance is close to that of Ru nanoparticles embedded in nanosized mesoporous Zr-promoted silica [26]. The activity of Ru/UiO-67 was nearly similar (11h−1), despite the much lower surface area of this sample compared with UiO-66. The Ru nanoparticles supported on MIL-140 supports displayed lower hydrogenation activity than those supported on UiO-66 and its analogues. Ru/MIL-140C exhibited the lowest activity in furfural hydrogenation. Several factors have been proposed to explain the hydrogenation activity of supported Ru nanoparticles [59–67]: the Ru particle size, the interaction of the Ru nanoparticles with the support, and the redox properties of RuOx species. It has also been proposed that a minimum size of Ru particles is necessary for the adsorption of the substrate [29]. One of the functions of the support is to stabilize Ru nanoparticles by strong metal-support interactions. When these interactions are very strong, the reducibility of the metal precursor may be impeded such that the metallic phase content is low, resulting in low hydrogenation activity. The electronic properties of the support may also influence the activity of Ru particles, as for instance reported for Ru on carbon [49,57]. The role of RuOx in hydrogenation has also been discussed, for instance in lactose hydrogenation [66]. Mitsudome et al., suggested that the redox properties of surface Ru atoms in RuOx play a crucial role in hydrogenation of sulfoxides to sulfides under mild conditions [67]. Alternatively, we propose that such RuOx species may have already been reduced to metallic Ru upon exposure to H2 under mild conditions. Ru-oxide species on Ru/UiO-66 were reduced even at room temperature and showed much higher hydrogenation activity than Ru/MIL-140C. Therefore, we expect that this re-reduction is important to the hydrogenation activity. The organic moiety and framework structure of the Zr-MOFs may have a profound effect on the reducibility of the Zr-MOF supported Ru particles. When this interaction is too strong, it becomes difficult to reduce Ru. We evaluated the reusability of the most active catalyst Ru/UiO-66. After the catalytic reaction, the catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation. The collected sample was repeatedly washed with acetone and deionized water. After drying at 50°C under vacuum, the catalyst was tested again under identical reaction conditions. Fig. 7 A shows that the furfural conversion did not appreciably decrease during five consecutive runs. Fig. 7B shows that the particle size of the spent catalyst did not change during the recycle test as determined by TEM analysis."
10,Conclusions,"Ru nanoparticles were loaded on a set of Zr-MOFs (UiO and MIL-140) by deposition-precipitation and reduced with N2H4žH2O and H2. The supported Ru nanoparticles were smaller than 3nm. All catalysts showed promising performance in the hydrogenation of furfural into furfuryl alcohol, with selectivity close to 100%. Ru/UiO-66 exhibited the highest activity and this catalyst could be reused in five consecutive reaction cycles without appreciable loss in performance. The good catalytic performance can be related to metallic Ru species formed upon exposure to H2 as revealed by quasi in situ XP spectroscopy. When the interaction between the RuOx nanoparticles and organic linkers in Zr-MOF is too strong, the RuOx is hardly reducible which explains the low hydrogenation activity as observed for Ru/MIL-140C."
