0,Introduction,"In the context of global problems in energy and climate, artificial photo-driven energy and chemical production have drawn increasing attention [1–3]. On this, large advancements have been achieved recently in searching and constructing photocatalyst systems [4,5]. However, the progress seems face bottleneck challenge, new concepts and technologies are urgently needed to break through it. Intrinsically, an effective photocatalyst system should be photoactive for light harvest, catalytically-active for molecule activation, and stable for sustainable running [5,6]. Many semiconductor materials (TiO2, ZnO, CdS, C3N4, etc [7–10] and dye molecules [11–13] have proper band structures or molecular energy levels for light harvest but are inert kinetically for target redox reactions, with high overpotentials. Oppositely, many metals, metal oxides, metal complexes (Pt, Pd, Cu, RuO2, IrO2, MnO2, Co3O4, etc [14,15]) are catalytically active to reduce the overpotentials but less photoactive. The current strategy in photocatalyst design is mostly based on physically assembling a photoactive matter and a catalytically-active matter together to create a donor-acceptor system so as to drive a molecular reaction. Such an assembly is indeed effective for the realization of photocatalytic molecule reactions, but the molecular photoactive substances often lose their activity totally within a few hours [16]. This problem has become a harder obstacle, globally blocking technical advance and often disturbing the routine examination to the intrinsic ability of photoactive substance. On the other hand, in the natural photosynthesis system, all of the photoactive substances (such as chlorophyll, accessory pigments and manganese cluster) are synthesized natively and can be self-reproduced continuously, which ensures the system running efficiently and sustainably, as one of the greatest wonders [17,18]. However, this basic tactics has been rarely applied in the artificial phootocatalysis systems. In the present report, we demonstrate that platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs), normally used as a cocatalyst in photocatalysis [19,20], can exhibit excellent hydrogen evolution rate in the presence of isopropanol, without any light sensitive substances imported externally. They work actually through a native synthesis of photoactive acetonyl-platinum complexes on PtNP surfaces, as shown in Scheme 1 . Although the photoactive species are damaged during the reaction, their synthesis is reproducible via continuous isopropanol oxidation and thus allows the system running sustainably."

Then the excess of acetone was removed by distillation."
5,Characterization of PtNP photocatalysts,"2.4 Characterization of PtNP photocatalysts The structures of the PtNPs were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2010 F, JEOL), equipped with an electron diffractometer, operated at 200 kV. For the TEM analyses, the sample was ultrasonically dispersed into absolute ethanol, and a drop of the resulted suspension was placed onto a carbon film-coated copper grid and then dried in air. The crystal structures were also characterized by an X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Bruker D8 Advance) with a Cu Kα (λ = 0.15406 nm), operated at 40 kV. The UV–Vis absorption spectrum was recorded on a Shimadzu UV 3600 UV–vis-NIR spectrophotometer. The surface analysis of the PtNPs and APC were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos Axis Ultra, Al KR source), the C 1 s reference of 284.5 eV was chosen for the calibration of binding energy. The concentration of OH radicals was detected by Fluorescence Spectroscopy (PL, Hitachi F-7000), which was observed during irradiation of the H2PtCl6-isopropanol in solution of terephthalic acid and NaOH (excitation at 315 nm, the data was recorded every 20 min of UV irradiation."
6,Photocatalysis tests,"2.5 Photocatalysis tests Photocatalytic experiments were performed using an innner-irradiation-type Pyrex reactor (250 ml) equipped with a 300 W high pressure Hg lamp. All the photocatalytic tests were performed in 200 ml of aqueous solution of reactants with desired concentration, using 2 mg of PTNPs photocatalyst. The reaction was carried out in argon atmosphere (10 ml ·min-1) and the reaction solution was magnetically stirred to fully disperse the catalysts. Liquid samples were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Haixin; GC-950) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). Gaseous samples were analyzed with a gas chromatograph (Fuli; GC-9790) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), an FID, and a methane converter."
7,Results and discussion,"This finding was observed initially when we examined the catalytic effect of PtNP on the photochemistry of alcohols in aqueous solution. In the studies, the platinum nanoparticles were initially prepared from the reduction of H2PtCl6 with methanol under a thermal refluxing condition [16], in the presence of surface protection reagent, polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP). The obtained Pt nanoparticles (denoted as PtNPprep) exhibit a narrow size distribution of 2–4 nm and a cubic structure crystalline structure (Figs. 1 a, S1). Experimental data showed that under the function of PtNPprep and UV irradiation, different alcohols display quite different photochemical responses. For isopropanol, PtNPprep shows a small effect on CO and CH4 evolution but greatly promote H2 generation (Figs. 1b, S2). 2 mg of PtNPprep led to a H2 evolution rate of 0.14 mmol⋅ h−1, increased about 8.3 times. While for methanol and ethanol, PtNP slightly speeded up their photolysis, with a synchronous increase in H2, CH4, and CO evolution (1.3–4.8 times increase in rate, Figs. S3 and S4), possibly via an interaction-induced activation. These observations indicate that unlike methanol and ethanol, isopropanol behaves a rapid dehydrogenation upon PtNP function. This reaction process is quite similar to the situation observed in Pt/TiO2-catalyzed photohydrogen generation from aqueous alcohol solution [22–24], in which TiO2 acts as photoactive object, while platinum acts as cocatalyst to promote H+ reduction. We carefully inspected the hydrogen generation process and noticed that H2 evolution always starts after 1 h irradiation (Fig. 1b), suggesting that the PtNPprep is not photoactive initially but undergoes a stepwise induction procedure. Light absorption measurement along the induction period certainly displayed a gradually increased absorption in the range of 220 ∼ 310 nm (Fig. S5a). Considering of the product acetone has an absorption in this range, we removed majority of acetone from the reaction system (after 3 h reaction) by a temperature-controlled distillation and observed a shoulder-like absorption band coming out at around 272 nm (Fig. S5b), which is likely associated with the formation of photoactive objects. The Eg(eV)= hc/λonset = 1240/λonset, and its energy level difference between the highest occupied orbital (HOMO) and the lowest vacant orbital (LUMO), which showed the band gap is 4.56 eV and exhibited photocatalytic ability in the ultraviolet region. So we tried to directly synthesize surface-unprotected platinum nanoparticles by an in-situ photo-reduction of H2PtCl6 with aqueous isopropanol solution [15,19], without using any protection reagent. After 40 min UV irradiation, platinum nanoparticles (PtNPinsitu) with sizes of 4–5 nm (Fig. 2 a, S8) were produced readily. On-line gas analysis during the reaction showed that H2 started release after 30 min irradiation and continuously increased in rate of 0.50 mmol⋅ h−1 after 3 h (Fig. 2b). Also, we found that PtNP is highly active for isopropanol solution(Fig. S7b) but nearly inert for methanol and ethanol solutions (Fig. S7a), although PtNP can also form in methanol and ethanol solutions (Fig. S9), which was remarkable different from the Pt/TiO2 performances, in which TiO2 acts as photoactive substance [25]. The specificity of isopropanol for the sole work of PtNP logically suggests that the formation of photoactive objects is associated with the peculiarity of isopropanol or its products, especially acetone. As has been reported that during the photolysis of 2-propanol the products of the reaction is CH3COCH3 [26–28]. It means that the photolysis product acetone as photoactive objects during the a stepwise induction procedure. Also,as was previously reported that under UV irradiation, acetone is capable to coordinate with platinum species to produce photoactive acetonyl platinum complexes (APC) [29]. It is imaginable that similar APC species likely forms on PtNP surfaces and are responsible for the light harvest to drive the water splitting reaction. To verify the formation of surface APC, we inspected the characteristic of the PtNPinsitu (collected after 5 h reaction), compared with bulk APC that was synthesized by the light-induced reaction between H2PtCl6 and acetone [29]. The synthesized bulk APC exhibits a strong light absorption at about 270 nm (Fig. S7c), well matched to the shoulder-like absorption signal observed in the PtNPprep-catalyzed reaction system (Fig. S7b). X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) was employed to inspect the surface structure of the PtNPinsitu and revealed that Pt(II) and Pt(IV) species are also evident on the particle surfaces, together with Pt(0) species (Fig. 2c). Also, the bond energy of Pt-C in XPS Pt4f at 71.5 eV(Fig. 2c, [30]) and the C-Pt bond in XPS C1 s at 284.3 eV(Fig. S10), which can be further explained the formation of photoactive acetonyl-platinum complexes. To understand the photocatalysis function of the surface APC more clearly, we carefully observed the kinetic scenes displayed by the synthesized bulk APC, as shown in Fig. 2d. As a whole scene, the APC seems capable to catalyze hydrogen generation from aqueous isopropanol solution, even with an activity much higher than the PtNPprep. However, the reaction obviously undergoes an induction process, showing no hydrogen evolution in the initial reaction stage (before 30 min) and subsequently a continuous rate increase within 1.5 h. This kinetic behavior is similar to the situation of the PtNPprep, suggesting that the APC is incapable to work by itself. TEM observation revealed that during the APC-driven reaction, tiny metallic platinum nanoparticles with size of 1∼2 nm are produced concomitantly (Fig. S11), implying that they cooperate with the APC to catalyze water splitting, acting as a acceptor of photo-excited electrons for charge separation and as a “co-catalyst” for H+ reduction, analogous to the situations in semiconductor-based and molecular photocatalyst systems [31,32]. This proposal is further confirmed by observing the photocatalysis behavior of a physical APC-PtNPprep mixture, which plays an immediate function for hydrogen generation, without a noticeable induction process (Fig. 2d). In this case, the reaction rate still displays a continuous increase within 1.0 h, reflecting a stepwise structural adjustment between APC and PtNPprep. Logically, the interaction between them would drive the APC load or chemically bond to the platinum particle surfaces, by which a unique closely-anchored donor-acceptor system would be constructed to facilitate charge transfer for more efficient water splitting reaction. From the information obtained above, it can be concluded that the unusual solo work of platinum nanoparticles in photohydrogen generation from aqueous isopropanol solution is actually hided with a synergic function between platinum particle and surface APC formed from native isopropanol oxidation, as shown in Scheme 1. On the basis of this knowledge, we introduced acetone beforehand into the H2PtCl6-isopropanol-water reaction system to facilitate surface APC formation and found that it is quite effective to shorten or eliminate the reaction induction period and, more importantly, greatly raised hydrogen generation rate (Fig. 3 a). At a proper acetone concentration (such as 7.5 ml⋅L−1), H2 evolution rate could reach to 8.01 mmol⋅ h−1, raised about 16 times. The decrease of H2 evolution rate at higher acetone concentrations could be assigned to a kinetic competition between acetone hydrogenation reduction and H2 evolution reaction [33]. A more interesting characteristic of the present Pt-based photocatalysis system is that the photoactive surface APC forms natively during the reaction and can be self-reproduced through an isopropanol-to-acetone oxidation and a subsequent surface coordination process (Scheme 1). This trait can be witnessed by acetone-response transient kinetics probing experiments in the aqueous H2PtCl6 solution containing different alcohols (Fig. 3b three responses for methanol and ethanol). For methanol and ethanol solution, hydrogen evolution rate is much low before acetone introduction, although PtNPs can also form from the photoreduction of H2PtCl6 in these cases (Fig. S11). Upon acetone introduction, H2 evolution is initially speeded up gradually by the photoactive APC formed on PtNP surfaces, but it subsequently slows down to the original level within 1.0 h, reflecting that the surface APC formed are actually instable. Differently, for the isopropanol reaction system, the H2 evolution rate raised by acetone introduction can keep at the high level for 20 h, meaning that the instable APC can be locally self-reproduced by the isopropanol-to-acetone oxidation. This trait allows the system run sustainably, unlike the other artificial molecular photocatalysts, which often lose their activities irreversibly within few hours [16,34,35]. It should be annotated that under the present conditions, the size growth of the PtNPs formed is evident (Fig. S12), it logically diminishes accessible surfaces and thus arouses an obvious activity decline after 16 h reaction. If proper ways are found to effectively restrain PtNP growth, more robust running is expectable. To understand the reaction mechanism, we tried to trace the origin of H2 in the isopropanol-water reaction system by using deuterated isopropanol (CD3-CD(OD)-CD3). Surprisingly, we found that H2 was produced nearly completely, while D2 and HD rarely (Fig. 4 a). A checking experiment was performed using normal isopropanol and deuterated water (CH3−CH(OH)−CH3 + D2O), wherein D2 was produced dominantly (Fig. S13). These observations indicate that it is water rather than isopropanol contributing to the hydrogen evolution and suggest that the reaction actually proceeds via a water splitting process [17,18]. As detected by radical capture (Fig. 3b) and pH measurement (Fig. S14) during the reaction, ⋅OH radicals and H+ ions readily form as intermediate species, suggesting that water is dissociated by a hole-induced oxidation process (reaction (1)), where after H+ ions are reduced into H2 by electrons (reaction (2)). (1) 2H2O+2h+→2⋅OH+2H+ (2) 2H+ + 2e− → H2"
8,Conclusions,"Summarily, we demonstrate that in a light-irradiated aqueous isopropanol solution, which photolysis to produce acetone and consume photoelectron in time and be oxidized to form acetone. And then the platinum nanoparticles are able to create a unique self-reproducible photocatalysis system on their surfaces and display sustainable powerful ability for water splitting. Since various metals and organic matters are involved in photocatalysis studies (inc. water splitting and organic synthesis), this finding provides an additional window for the rational insight into their working mechanisms. More importantly, the self-reproduction photocatalysis concept, meeting well the nature of natural photosynthesis, might breed new strategies and technologies to create more efficient and robust artificial photocatalysis systems."
