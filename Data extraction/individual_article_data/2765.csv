0,Introduction,"Aqueous phase reforming (APR) is an emerging technology for the production of hydrogen, light alkane, syn-gas and bio-gasoline through the catalytic conversion of aqueous oxygenated hydrocarbons such as glycerol, ethylene glycol, glucose and sugar alcohol derived from biomass resources [1–5]. Recently, due to the reduction of fossil fuel resources and increasing emissions of green house gases, research on the conversion of biomass as a renewable resource has attracted much attention [3,6–8]. In the APR process, using a variety of oxygenated hydrocarbon compounds as feedstock, a reforming reaction and water-gas shift reaction occur simultaneously at low temperature (160–265°C) and relatively low pressure of less than 60bar in a simple single reactor system [6,7]. From the aspect of hydrogen production, a simple vapor-liquid separator can be applied to produce a hydrogen rich stream containing less than 100ppmw of carbon monoxide, so that the resulting hydrogen can be fed directly into the PEM fuel-cell system [6,7]. On the contrary, conventional steam reforming requires a high temperature of above 700°C and an auxiliary two-staged water-gas shift reaction process to complement the insufficient activity, which means that this is a complicated and energy-intensive process [9]. Compared with steam reforming, the APR process, due to its relatively mild reaction conditions, its simple single-step process with a high hydrogen yield, and its selectivity without toxic by-products, is associated with low-energy consumption and low capital costs for the production of hydrogen. From the previous study performed to determine the reaction mechanism of the APR of polyols [1], various reactions such as C–C bond cleavage, C–O bond cleavage, water-gas shift reaction, dehydrogenation/hydrogenation, methanation, and Fischer–Tropsch reaction were encountered in the APR process; these reactions have strong relationships with active metal components, feed materials, reaction conditions, and support materials. In order to maximize the hydrogen selectivity during the APR reaction, C–C bond cleavage on the catalyst surface should be accelerated while C–O bond cleavage and methanation/Fischer–Tropsch reaction should be avoided [1]. Therefore, extensive research has been conducted on the control of hydrogen selectivity and the production rate in the APR reaction. Among the studies performed, the development of catalyst support has been focused on due to its dramatic effect on the stability and activity of APR [1,4,10,11]. When metal oxides such as Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2, ZnO and TiO2 are used as support material, their porous structures are destroyed by sintering under the aqueous reaction conditions of high temperature and pressure; or, the specific surface area decreases due to phase transfer, which restricts the usage of metal oxides as support of the APR catalyst [4,10,12–14]. Therefore, higher hydrothermal stability is required for porous support to solve the above problems in the APR reaction. Porous carbon materials like activated carbon or carbon nanotubes have recently drawn attention as a new support material due to their large surface area, moderate pore volume, and good mechanical/chemical stability [15]. It was reported in WO 2007/075476 that aqueous solutions containing at least 20wt% of oxygenated compounds can be reformed over a catalyst comprising a Group VIII transition metal and a Group VIIB transition metal, preferably supported on an activated carbon-supported catalyst [16]. In spite of the high surface area and hydrothermal stability of activated carbon, its irregular pore structure and broad pore size distribution as well as its microporosity, not only hinder transport of liquid reactant to the catalytic active site, but also block the evolution of gaseous products from the catalyst [17–19], which results in a lower selectivity and lower production rate of hydrogen. Recently, our group found that an ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) CMK-3 supported Pt catalyst was very efficient for producing hydrogen in the APR process [15]. Compared to the support of activated carbon (AC), CMK-3 support, owing to its regular pore arrangement with narrow distribution of pore size, is favorable for the transport and diffusion of reactants and products [15,20,21]. Furthermore, highly dispersed Pt metal particles on the CMK-3 support exhibit better catalytic activity in the APR reaction than do such particles on AC. In addition, our group also reported that a hollow-type OMC (CMK-5) supported Pt catalyst showed a higher catalytic performance in the APR of EG than did the 2-D rod-type OMC structure (CMK-3); this discrepancy might be due to a synergetic effect of the low amount of metal sintering during the reaction process and the more favorable transport and diffusion of the reactants and products [22]. In this study, we considered the APR catalytic activity of polyols for hydrogen production using OMC supported Pt catalysts with different particle sizes. CMK-3 and CKM-5 were generally synthesized with particle size in the micrometer range. Therefore, the Pt/OMC catalyst is still associated with the aggregation of active Pt metal nanoparticles during the APR reaction. This active metal aggregation can negatively affect the catalytic activity of the APR reaction. To investigate the effect of the particle size of the catalyst, nano-sized Pt/CMK-3 and Pt/CMK-5 catalysts were synthesized and their APR activity levels were evaluated using different polyol reactants such as ethylene glycol and glycerol."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) hard template,"2.1 Synthesis of ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) hard template Micro-sized SBA-15 (2-dimensional hexagonal P6mm structure) ordered mesoporous silica microparticle (MSM) was synthesized using the method reported in the literature [23], which involving a hydrothermal treatment of gel liquid mixture in a strong acid solution; this product is hereafter denoted as SBA-15-MSM. Two different types of ordered mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) were prepared. For the condensation of an SBA-15 silica mesoporous wall, the first MSN was synthesized using a modified dry-gel route [24] instead of the conventional hydrothermal treatment in strong acidic solution. After the hydrolysis of TEOS in poylmeric template (Pluronic P123), resulting solid materials was recovered, and dried leading to a steam assisted dry-gel conversion, the product is denoted as SBA-15-MSN-D. Another MSN material was synthesized using the rapid synthesis method reported by Johansson et al. [25], in which NH4F was added to a Pluronic P123 dissolution mixture and after the complete dissolution of P123, n-heptane was also added to the solution with tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS); this process is different from the method of micro-sized SBA-15 synthesis. The obtained silica nanoparticle was denoted as SBA-15-MSN-R. All the prepared micro-sized and nano-sized SBA-15 materials were converted to aluminosilicate form (Al-SBA-15) by impregnation with an ethanolic solution of AlCl3 (Si/Al=20)."
3,Synthesis of ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC),"2.2 Synthesis of ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) Two types of OMCs were synthesized using a hard templating synthesis method with furfuryl alcohol as a carbon precursor. Rod-type ordered mesoporous carbon CMK-3 was prepared by the complete filling of the mesopore channels of Al-SBA-15 silica hard templates [26]. Al-SBA-15 was filled with furfuryl alcohol (FA) to 85% of the OMS's total pore volume. The sample containing FA was placed in an oven at 35°C for 1h and then at 100°C for 1h. The resultant polymer/composite sample was further heated for 2h at 350°C. After the sample was cooled to room temperature, the sample was subsequently once more filled with furfuryl alcohol to 55% of the Al-SBA-15 total pore volume; we then carried out drying and heating as in the first case, followed by pyrolysis at 900°C with N2 flow for 2h. The final CMK-3 was recovered from the silica template; it was removed with an aqueous HF/ethanol mixture solution [22,26]. The resulting CMK-3 samples were denoted as CMK-3-MCM, CMK-3-MCN-D, and CMK-3-MCN-R based on the utilized hard template species. Hollow-type ordered mesoporous carbon CMK-5 (2-D hexagonal structure) was obtained by the incomplete filling of the Al-SBA-15 mesopores [22,27,28]. Al-SBA-15 was filled with FA to 100% of its total pore volume. The sample containing FA was dried using a freeze-drying method under vacuum atmosphere. Carbonization of FA inside the pores of Al-SBA-15 was carried out at 100°C for 1h, followed by pyrolysis under vacuum at 900°C. The silica template of prepared CMK-5 was removed in the same manner as was used for CMK-3 [22]. Resulting CMK-5 samples were denoted as CMK-5-MCM, CMK-5-MCN-D, and CMK-5-MCN-R based on the utilized hard template species."
4,Synthesis of Pt/OMC catalysts [22],"2.3 Synthesis of Pt/OMC catalysts [22] Pt catalysts with nominal Pt loading of 7 wt% supported on OMCs were prepared using a simple incipient wetness method with aqueous solution of hexachloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O) containing acetone as the solvent. After the impregnation of the Pt precursor, the samples were dried at 35°C for 1h followed by drying at 60°C for 6h in ambient air to remove acetone. Before the APR reaction, the prepared catalysts were reduced via heating under a hydrogen flow rate of 50mlmin−1. The reduction temperature linearly increased from room temperature to 260°C with a heating rate of 1.0°Cmin−1; temperature was then maintained at 260°C for 12h. The samples were subsequently cooled with nitrogen flow for 6h."
5,Characterization of catalysts,"2.4 Characterization of catalysts Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were taken with a Rigaku Multiplex instrument equipped with a Cu-Kα source at 40kV and 40mA (1.6kW). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to characterize the morphologies of CMK-3-type and CMK-5-type samples. The images were taken using a Philips XL-30S FEG and Tescan Mira 3 LMU FEG scanning electron microscopes with accelerating voltages of 10kV and 20kV, respectively. Before the SEM measurement, the samples were coated with gold. The porous structure of the samples was analyzed using a nitrogen adsorption–desorption experiment at −196°C using a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 volumetric adsorption analyzer. The surface area of the samples was calculated by using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation from the adsorption data obtained at P/P 0 between 0.05 and 0.2. The total volume of micro- and mesopores was calculated from the amount of nitrogen adsorbed at P/P 0 =0.95, assuming that adsorption on the external surface was negligible compared to adsorption in the pores. The pore size distribution was derived using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method with the adsorption branch of the N2 isotherm. To obtain the Pt dispersion, CO chemisorption was carried out using a Micromeritics volumetric chemisorption analyzer (ASAP 2020 Chemi). The amount of platinum in the catalysts was measured with an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) using Spectro Ciros Vision instrument."
6,APR activity test,"2.5 APR activity test Aqueous phase reforming of 10wt% polyols (ethylene glycol and glycerol) was carried out using the method described in the literature [15,22]. A fixed bed reactor was made with a 3/8in. inner diameter and 14in. height stainless steel tube (SS316) and an up-flow liquid feeding system. A type-K thermocouple (Omega) and PID controller were used to control the reaction temperature. A liquid feed of 10wt% polyol in deionized water was fed into the catalytic reactor at 0.1mlmin−1 with a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pump. 0.3g of catalyst was placed in the middle of the stainless steel tube and quartz wool was used to fill the empty space of the tube. Before the APR reaction, the catalyst was pretreated with an H2 flow at a 50mLmin−1 flow at 260°C for 2h. After reduction treatment, the temperature of the reactor was cooled to room temperature for removal of the adsorbed H2 gas using N2 as a sweep gas. Aqueous phase reforming reaction was carried out with 2.0h−1 of weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) at 250°C under 45atm. The product gases were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (6100GC, Young Lin Instrument Co.) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID). H2, CO, CO2, and CH4 content in the effluent gas were detected by TCD using a packed Carboxen column (3.175mm id×4.57m); hydrocarbons were detected by the FID using a capillary GS-GASPRO column (3.175mm id×15m). The H2 yield, H2 and alkane selectivity, and carbon conversion to gas were calculated by the following equations: [2] H 2 yield ( % ) = H 2 produced experiementally H 2 calculates according to theoretical quantity × 100 H 2 selectivity ( % ) = H 2 produced experiementally C atoms produced in gas products × n × 100 n is reciprocal of H2/CO2 reforming ratio for polyol (ethylene glycol: 2/5, glycerol: 3/7). Alkane selectivity ( % ) = C atoms in alkane produced Total C atoms produced in gas products × 100 Carbon conversion ( % ) = C atoms in the gas − phase product Total C atoms in the feedstock × 100"
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of supports and catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of supports and catalysts Fig. 1 shows the low angle XRD patterns of (a) the silica templates (SBA-15), corresponding carbon replicas of (b) rod-type CMK-3 series, and (c) hollow-type CMK-5 series. As depicted in Fig. 1(a), the SBA-15 samples prepared with different synthesis methods showed three distinct XRD peaks, which can be indexed as (100), (110), and (200), reflecting a highly ordered mesoporous structure with a 2-dimensional hexagonal p6mm symmetry [29]. Compared with the (100) peak of micro-sized SBA-15-MSM, nano-sized SBA-15-MSN synthesized using the modified dry-gel method exhibited a higher 2 theta value of the (100) peak, indicating a smaller pore diameter than that of the SBA-15-MSM. On the contrary, the 2 theta value of the (100) peak of nano-sized SBA-15-MSN-R prepared using the rapid synthesis method shifted to a lower 2 theta value compared with that of SBA-15-MSM, implying a widening of the pore diameter. Fig. 1(b) and (c) clearly confirms the successful replication of the mesoporous silica SBA-15-MSM template to rod-type CMK-3-MCM [30] and hollow-type CMK-5-MCM [31]. In the case of nano-sized CMK-3-MCN-X and CMK-5-MCN-X, Fig. 1(b) and (c) also shows successful replications of SBA-15-MSN-X. The representative diffraction peak of (100) for the hollow-type carbons CMK-5s became much weaker than those of the rod-type CMK-3s due to diffraction interference between the hollow frameworks [27]. In conclusion, the micro-sized CMK-3-MCM and CMK-5-MCM show XRD patterns similar to the nano-sized CMK-3-MCN-X and CMK-5-MCM-X, indicating that nano-sized carbon MCNs are structurally almost identical to micro-sized carbons MCMs. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of the resultant OMCs are shown in Fig. 2 (a) and (b). All OMCs exhibited a type IV curve with sharp capillary condensation steps at a range of P/P 0 =0.4–0.6. Pore size distribution data were calculated by according to BJH pore size distribution using the adsorption branch of their isotherms (data not shown). All Rod-type CMK-3-MCM, CMK-3-MCN-D, and CKM-3-MCN-R show narrow pore size distribution. The mesopores of CMK-3-MCN-D have a pore size of 3.5nm which is slightly smaller than that of CMK-3-MCM (3.6nm), while the pore size of CMK-3-MCN-R (6.5nm) is much higher than that of CMK-3-MCM. These pore size distribution data are in good accordance with the corresponding XRD data (Fig. 1(a) and (b)). This indicates that the modified dry-gel method for the synthesis of nano-sized CMK-3-MCN-D hardly affects the mesoporosity (pore diameter), rather, it only changes the morphology in such aspects as particle size, which is in contrast to the case of conventional micro-sized CMK-3-MCM. On the other hand, the rapid synthesis method using a solvent for the preparation of nano-sized CMK-3-MCN-R increase the pore size to 6.5nm, which might be deduced as having been the result of enlarging of the pore diameter of the nano-sized silica template SBA-15-MSN-R. It is generally known that the pore size of SBA-15 (normally 6–9nm) can be increased by adding a swelling agent [32] or by varying the hydrothermal treatment condition [33]. Johansson et al. [25] reported that low-temperature synthesis with heptane and NH4F as solvent can control the pore size up to 18nm. In this study, we applied the method according to the recipe reported by Johansson et al. [25] to synthesize the nano-sized SBA-15 so that the resultant pore size of the SBA-15-MSN-D is in good agreement with the value from the literature. In conclusion, the mesoporous property of OMCs is strongly correlated to the characteristics of the corresponding mesoporous silica hare template. Hollow-type OMCs (CMK-5-MCM, CKM-5-MCN-X) show bimodal mesopores; this structure can be attributed to an inner pore of carbon framework and an intra-pore between the carbon frameworks [27]. Therefore, hollow-type CMK-5 carbons Exhibit 1.5–1.7 times higher BET surface area than those of rod-type CMK-3 carbons, which is shown in Table 1 . In common with the CMK-3 series, all hollow-type CMK-5-MCM, CMK-5-MCN-D, and CKM-5-MCN-R were successfully synthesized using SBA-15 hard templates. Representative SEM images of both micro-sized and nano-sized OMCs are displayed in Fig. 3 . The SEM image of CMK-3-MSM shows short and curved particle morphologies, which are not uniform; the particle size is in the range of 1–3μm (Fig. 3(a)). A smaller particle size of around 600nm and more uniform pealike morphology were found in the nano-sized CMK-3-MCN-D carbon synthesized using the dry-gel conversion route for SBA-15-MSM-D (Fig. 3(b)). Nano-sized CMK-3-MCN-R shows a morphology different from that of CMK-3-MCM and CKM-3-MCN-D. The particles of CMK-5-MCN-R have a monodispersed elliptic, spindle-like shape, of which length is around 700nm and the diameter is in the range of 150–200nm (Fig. 3(c)). These results are in good accord with the previous data as described in the literature [25]. Compared with micro-sized CMK-3-MCM, nano-sized CMK-3-MCN-D showed a more uniform morphology and shortened particle size without a change of pore diameter; nano-sized CMK-3-MCN-R exhibited changes of both particle size and particle shape as well as pore diameter. The particle morphologies of micro- and nano-sized CMK-3s are almost the same as those of template silicas (data not shown), indicating that the morphological aspect of SBA-15 silica template is faithfully transferred to mesoporous carbons by the replication process. In the case of CMK-5s, replication behavior similar to that of CMK-3 is also found in the aspect of morphology (Fig. 3(d)–(f)). To determine the Pt particle size and metal dispersion of the Pt loaded catalysts, CO chemisorption analyses were carried out; results are shown in Table 2 . Through our previous results [15], Pt particle sizes when impregnated in CMKs support were confirmed by TEM analysis; the data agreed well with the results of CO chemisorption. Therefore, CO chemisorption was applied to analyse the Pt particle size in this study. Before CO chemisorption, Pt loading on OMC supports was determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) analysis to calculate the precise Pt dispersion. The target Pt loading was 7wt%, which value was chosen from our previous studies [15,34] for maximum hydrogen production. From the ICP-AES results, Pt metal was introduced without a significant loss of the Pt (around 6.91–6.96wt%). As expected, in comparison with other Pt/nano-sized CMK-3-MCN-X catalysts, Pt/micro-sized CMK-3-MCM shows the lowest Pt dispersion (59.7%) and the highest Pt particle size of 1.79nm. Pt dispersion of the Pt/CMK-3-MCN-D catalyst increased to 62.3%, which could be attributed to the smaller particle size of the catalyst, in a range from 1 to 3μm to around 600nm, as well as to the slightly higher specific surface area. Furthermore, Pt/CMK-3-MCN-R exhibited the highest Pt dispersion (68.6%) among the Pt/CMK-3 catalysts. The particles of the Pt/CMK-3-MCN-R catalyst are around 600nm long and have a diameter of 150–200nm (Fig. 3(c)). Therefore, agglomeration of the Pt nanoparticles might be restricted by the confinement of the shorter diameter CMK-3-MCN-R support itself, in spite of the similar particle lengths of CMK-3-MCN-D and CMK-3-MCN-R. In addition, the metal dispersion of the Pt catalyst supported on the hollow-type CMK-3-MCN-R support was larger than that of the rod-type CMK-5-MCN-R supported Pt catalyst from a framework-configurational perspective. Our previous study elucidated the fact that the larger surface area with additional mesopores of the hollow-type OMC support leads to greater metal dispersion [22]. The highest metal dispersion was obtained in the Pt/CMK-5-MCN-R catalyst due to the synergetic effect of the 3D pore structure and the high surface area that resulted from the hollow-type framework-configuration."
9,Effect of support on APR activity,"3.2 Effect of support on APR activity The catalytic performance of OMC supported Pt catalysts with different particle size of support was investigated for the aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol under conditions of 250°C, 45atm, and WHSV of 2.0h−1 for 24h in a fixed bed reactor (Table 3 ). Among the tested OMC supported Pt catalysts, the Pt/CMK-3-MCM catalyst showed the lowest carbon conversion (78.6%), H2 yield (60.4%), and H2 production rate (40.4cm3gcat −1min−1) compared with those values for Pt/CMK-3-MCNs. When we applied the Pt/CMK-3-MCN-D catalyst, carbon conversion and H2 yield increase to 84.7% and 71.7%, respectively. It should be noted that the APR activity of Pt/CMK-3-MCN-D is higher than that of Pt/CMK-3-MSM in spite of the fact that the pore diameters of Pt/CMK-3-MCM (micro-sized particle) are almost the same, at around 3.6nm (Table 1); as well, the catalysts have similar shape (Fig. 3(a) and (b)). This suggests that the nano-sized particles of Pt/CMK-3-MCN-D are more favorable for the transport and diffusion of reactants and products than are the micro-sized particles of Pt/CMK-3-MCM; from this observation it can be guessed that the particle size of the catalysts might be one of the important controlling factors for aqueous phase reforming. Pt/CMK-3-MCN-R catalyst prepared by the replication of nano-sized silica template SBA-15-MSN-R synthesized by rapid synthesis method showed the highest APR activity among the tested Pt/CMK-3 catalysts. This high performance of Pt/CMK-3-MCM-R could be attributed to its smaller particle size of support (about 700nm in length and 150–200nm in diameter) as well as its larger pore diameter of 6.5nm, compared with those qualities of other Pt/CMK-3-MCM and Pt/CMK-3-MCN-D catalysts. This rod-like morphology is of interest due to its small dimensions, which result in short diffusion paths and thereby the possibility of fast adsorption and mass transfer [25]. In this experiment, the rod-like morphology of Pt/CMK-3-MCN-R seems to play an important role in increasing the APR activity. In addition, enlarging the pore diameter of Pt/CMK-3-MCN-R is another reason for the increased of APR activity. Park et al. [34] carried out aqueous phase reforming over Pt containing 3D-bimodal mesoporous carbon catalyst. They suggested that larger secondary mesopores ranging from 12 to 17nm are advantageous for the initial decomposition of ethylene glycol and more desirable for catalytic reactions of larger reactants [34]. Therefore, the higher activity of Pt/CMK-3-MCN-R catalyst is deduced to be a result of the synergistic effect of smaller particle size and larger pore diameter. Compared to rod-type CMK-3, the hollow-type Pt/CMK-5-MCN-R catalyst showed higher carbon conversion and H2 yield. It is suggested that hollow-type OMC has more open structure than that of rod-type OMC and the metal nanoparticles are more finely dispersed on the surface of the support [22]. The conversion of ethylene glycol to gas, the H2 yield and the H2 production rate increased in proportion to the Pt dispersion as shown in Tables 2 and 3; the structural aspects of supports also increased. The effect of polyol structure, i.e. chain length, on hydrogen production was studied by aqueous phase reforming [10,21]. From the studies, it was found that the longer the chain length of the reactant is, the lower the APR activity that is found. We investigated the APR activity of the prepared catalyst using larger reactant glycerol compared with ethylene glycol; the results are shown in Table 4 . All catalysts showed lower activity than that of the aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol, which is in good accordance with results found in the literature [21]. The hydrogen yield of nano-sized Pt/CMK-3-MCN-R was 50.1%, with a 31.5% increase rate compared with a value of 38.1% for micro-sized Pt/CMK-3-MCM. In the case of ethylene glycol reforming, the H2 yield increased from 60.4% for Pt/CMK-3-MCM to 71.7% for Pt/CMK-3-MCN-R, which is an increase rate of 27.1%. This suggests that smaller particle size of catalyst is more favorable for the reforming of large molecules such as glycerol due to the short diffusion paths."
10,Conclusions,"We successfully synthesized micro-sized and nano-sized OMC supported Pt catalysts. Modified dry-gel conversion method and rapid synthesis method using solvent were applied for the synthesis of the nano-sized OMC materials; these processes resulted in different morphologies of the nano-sized OMCs. OMC supported Pt catalysts were prepared by an incipient wetness method. XRD, N2 isotherms and SEM analyses show that the morphologica aspect of SBA-15 silica template is faithfully transferred to mesoporous carbons by the replication process. Aqueous phase reforming of polyols for hydrogen production was conducted over nano- and micro-sized OMC supported Pt catalysts. Nano-sized particles of Pt/CMK-3-MCN-D and Pt/CMK-3-MCN-R due to easier transport and diffusion of reactants and products, showed better APR activity than did micro-sized particles of Pt/CMK-3-MCM, indicating that a smaller particle size of catalysts might be one of the most important controlling factors for aqueous phase reforming, along well a larger pore diameter of catalyst for bulky molecules. And, APR activity is also well correlated to the Pt dispersion of the catalyst. Pt/CMK-5 with a hollow-type framework-configuration, due to its open structure and high dispersion of metal, exhibited higher APR activity than did rod-type Pt/CMK-3."
