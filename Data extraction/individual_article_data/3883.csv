0,Introduction,"Furfural is a furan derivative that can serve as a building block for fuels and chemicals [1] or as a liquid fuel itself. Interestingly, it is also known to be inhibitory in alcohol production by Saccharomyces cerevisiae [2]. Reduction of furfural's aldehyde moiety forms primarily furfuryl alcohol and small amounts of 2-methylfuran [3], valuable intermediates in the perfumery, pharmaceutical and polymer industries [4,5]. In particular, furfuryl alcohol has wide application in a variety of synthetic fibers, rubbers, thermostatic resins and farm chemicals [4]. It can serve as a solvent for furan resins and pigments of low solubility [6] and also as a component in rocket fuel [7]. 2-Methylfuran is an intermediate in syntheses of crysanthemate pesticides, perfume intermediates and chloroquine lateral chains in medical polymers [5]. It may serve as a fuel itself, or as an octane enhancer that reduces CO and volatile hydrocarbon emissions [8]. The main method for preparation of furfuryl alcohol and 2-methylfuran is vapor-phase catalytic hydrogenation (CH) of furfural [3,4,9,10]. This approach requires high reaction temperatures (573–673K) and pressurized hydrogen [3], a gaseous reagent not always available where furfural is produced. In this study, we explored furfural reduction via electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) as a mild, efficient alternative to CH [11]. This approach is usually performed at atmospheric pressure and temperatures below 100°C with electricity as the reducing agent. The main difference between CH and ECH is the way to generate atomic hydrogen: the CH process requires externally supplied hydrogen gas and splits molecular hydrogen to atomic hydrogen (Eq. (1)), while ECH reduces hydronium ions to form atomic hydrogen in situ on the catalytic cathode surface using external electrons (Eq. (2)) [12]. (1) H2 +2M→2(H)adsM (2) H3O+ +e− +M→(H)adsM+H2O Here, M is the metal active site for hydrogen and (H)adsM is the chemisorbed hydrogen. The other reactions involved in the ECH process include adsorption of unsaturated compounds (Eq. (3)), the hydrogenation reaction between the adsorbed unsaturated compounds and the adsorbed hydrogen (Eq. (4)), and desorption of the hydrogenated product (Eq. (5)). (3) (Y=Z)aq +A→(Y=Z)adsA (4) 2(H)adsM+(Y=Z)adsA→(YH–ZH)adsA+2M (5) (YH–ZH)adsA→(YH-ZH)aq +A Here, Y=Z is an unsaturated organic reactant, A is the adsorption site for organic substrate, (Y=Z)adsA is the adsorbed organic compound, and (YH–ZH)adsA is the adsorbed hydrogenated product. During ECH, hydrogen (H2) is commonly formed as a side product from the cathode's chemisorbed hydrogen via the Tafel (Eq. (6)) or Heyrovsky (Eq. (7)) reactions. These processes compete with hydrogenation of organics and negatively affect the electrochemical efficiency (E.E.) of ECH [13,14]. However, the hydrogen byproduct has value and could be further used in other catalytic processing. (6) (H)adsM+(H)adsM→H2 +2M (7) (H)adsM+(H+)aq +e− →H2 +M A few electrocatalytic hydrogenation studies of furfural to furfuryl alcohol have been reported at room temperature, Chu obtained 61.7% of furfuryl alcohol using a nano TiO2 film electrode [6]. But earlier studies by Parpot et al. [15] explored electroreduction of furfural on Pt and Pb cathodes in 0.1M HClO4 and 0.1M H2SO4, and on Cu in an alkaline medium. Interestingly, they noted 2-methylfuran in some of their final product mixtures, but reported neither yields nor optimized conditions for this little-discussed reaction. With the Pt cathode, the selectivity from furfural to furfuryl alcohol was 98% but the conversion remained very low (7.8%) after 24.5h of electrolysis. With Cu in a carbonate buffer (pH 10), 80% of the furfural was selectively reduced to furfuryl alcohol and the conversion reached 90% within 5.5h; this result echoed an earlier finding by Chamoulaud et al. [16], which showed that furfuryl alcohol was formed with 95% selectivity using a copper-modified graphite felt cathode in a flow cell. The present investigation explored ECH of furfural to furfuryl alcohol and 2-methylfuran in aqueous solution in a simple undivided cell with a sacrificial anode. This approach avoided the need for proton exchange membranes, lowering both electrical resistance and equipment costs relative to most literature studies, where divided cells and anodes made of noble metals, usually Pt, were used. In this work, different anode and cathode materials as well as varying pH conditions were studied and their effects on the product yield and electrochemical efficiency were examined. Effect of starting furfural concentration and current density were also investigated. The continuous cathode reactivation via nickel ion reduction and deposition was verified using a divided cell. Furthermore, the competitive reaction kinetics for ECH of furfural and benzaldehyde were investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Reagents and electrodes,"2.1 Reagents and electrodes Furfural (F) (≥98%), furfuryl alcohol (FA) (≥98%), 2-methylfuran (2-MF) (≥98%) and n-octane (>99%) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich and used as received without further purification. Deionized (DI) water and methanol (>99.9%) from Sigma–Aldrich were used as solvents. The cathode material, including pure copper (Cu), pure aluminum (Al), pure iron (Fe), pure nickel (Ni) and stainless steel (SS) 308 were obtained from McMaster-Carr. Nickel alloy (80% Ni, 20% Fe) and pure nickel were used as sacrificial anodes and were purchased from The Science Company."
3,Electrochemical cell setup,"2.2 Electrochemical cell setup The bench-scale electrocatalysis unit consisted of a simple undivided cell, configured in a manner similar to that of Navarro et al. [17] (Fig. 1 ). It was constructed using a 75mL thin layer chromatography (TLC) developing chamber, capped by a rubber stopper with holes for the anode and the cathode. To avoid oxidation of substrates on the anode side, a strip of nickel (2.8cm×3cm×0.1cm) was used as the sacrificial anode. Two types of nickel strips were used: nickel alloy and pure nickel. Several cathode materials were tested, including Fe, 308 SS, Cu, Al and pure Ni. Pretreatment of the electrodes was carried out to remove the metal oxides, which can deactivate the reaction when existing on the electrode surface. After polishing with sand paper, Ni, Cu, and SS electrodes were acid washed with 6.0M HCl solution while Fe was immersed in glacial acetic acid for 1h. The electrode made of Al required no acid wash. After pretreatment, all electrodes were rinsed with DI water. Base case experiments used 50mL of 100mM furfural solution in 4:1 mixture of water and methanol, a good solvent for both electrolyte and organic substrates [18]. Unless otherwise stated, 260% equivalent of electrons (1254 coulombs, 130% H2 equivalent) based on 100mM of furfural was passed to ensure sufficient conversion for all experiments. Ammonium chloride (0.2M) was selected as the electrolyte because it was previously shown to promote reactant conversion with good electrochemical efficiency [19]. A dual channel power supply from Lambda (Model: LPD 422A FM) was used to provide a constant current to the cells with the positive and negative leads connected to anode and cathode electrodes, respectively. Multimeters from Omega (Model: HHM34) were used to measure current and voltage. Unless otherwise stated, a current density of 600mA/dm2 was used for most of the experiments. The voltage varied between 1.6V and 2.1V, depending upon the cathode materials and the distance between electrodes. To investigate effects of nickel re-deposition on the product yield, a divided H-cell was used (Fig. 1) with a Nafion membrane separating the two chambers. Iron and pure nickel were used as the cathode and the anode. The catholyte was the same as in the undivided cell. There was only solvent (methanol:water, 1:4) and 0.2M electrolyte in the anolyte."
4,Product analyses,"2.3 Product analyses Aqueous samples were diluted ten-fold with acetonitrile, filtered through 0.22μm filters, and analyzed on a Shimadzu QP-5050A GC/MS. The GC used a Restek Rtx-1701 capillary column, 60 m×0.25mm with a 0.25μm film thickness, helium running at 1.0ml/min as carrier gas, and a split ratio of 1:100. The injector temperature was set at 270°C. The GC oven program started at 40°C for 1min, then heated at 8°C/min to 80°C, then at 15°C/min to 260°C. The mass spectrometer was operated in the electron ionization (EI) mode at an ionization energy of 80eV, a m/z ranging from 40 to 400, and a sampling interval of 0.34s. The identification of species associated with each chromatographic peak was done by comparing the observed mass spectrum with the NIST library and then confirmed by injection of authentic samples. External standards were used to quantify furfural and the products of furfural reduction."
5,Calculations,"2.4 Calculations The conversion, selectivity, yield and electrochemical efficiency were calculated according to the following equations: (8) Conversion = ( [ F ] t = 0 − [ F ] t ) / [ F ] t = 0 × 100 (9) Selectivity = ( [ FA ] t or [ 2 − MF ] t ) / ( [ FA ] t ) + [ 2 − MF ] t ) × 100 (10) Yield = ( [ FA ] t or 2-MF t ) / [ F ] t = 0 × 100 (11) E . E . = ( m 1 × n 1 + m 2 × n 2 ) / ( f × m × n ) × 100 Here, m 1, m 2 and m (mol) are the numbers of moles for furfuryl alcohol, 2-methylfuran and starting furfural, respectively; n 1 and n 2 are the numbers of electrons transferred during the reaction to furfuryl alcohol and 2-methylfuran, respectively (n 1 =2, n 2 =4), n is the number of electrons transferred during furfural reduction to furfuryl alcohol (n =2); f is the number of H2 equivalent and it's equal to 130%. E.E. is calculated based on all the products (furfuyl alcohol and 2-methylfuran) unless otherwise stated."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Material balance in ECH of furfural using iron as the cathode,"3.1 Material balance in ECH of furfural using iron as the cathode The selectivity and material balance were investigated by hydrogenating furfural using iron as the cathode and nickel alloy as the sacrificial anode in aqueous solution (Table 1 ). Furfuryl alcohol was the major product formed under these conditions, along with small quantities of 2-methylfuran. Pathway to these two products is shown in Scheme 1 [15]. As Table 1 shows, complete material balance closure was not achieved in any of the experiments. Poor material balances for reactions in undivided ECH cells have been previously observed but were not clearly explained [18]. Fig. 2 shows the results of three control experiments, performed without passing current, to quantify mass losses due to simple evaporation and chemical adsorption onto the electrodes: (1) substrate/electrolyte solution in cell without electrodes; (2) substrate/electrolyte solution in cell with electrodes; (3) substrate/electrolyte solution in cell with electrodes and a layer of octane on top to trap hydrophobic and volatile reaction species. There was no significant difference between controls (1) and (2) because the amount of organic compounds absorbed on the electrodes was small, on the order of 10−5 mmol. Controls (2) and (3) showed that evaporation contributed to the loss of reaction species as evidenced by less chemical loss with an octane layer trap. The relatively hydrophobic and volatile 2-methylfuran in particular was not very soluble in the aqueous electrolyte, so without the octane layer present as a trap, it separated from the aqueous phase and evaporated quickly. Table 2 presents results for the ECH of furfural, with and without the octane layer to enhance the recovery of furfuryl alcohol and 2-methylfuran. Reactant furfural was partially extracted into the octane layer, so its extent of conversion was less (78% vs 97% conversion) with octane present than in the octane-free run. Conversely, the improved product recovery with the octane-trap increased both the electrochemical efficiency (from 29% to 43%) and the material balance (from 64% to 85%). Control experiment (3) suggested that even with the octane layer, there was still significant material loss because of the evaporation and the experimental variability, which can be considered as one of the loss mechanisms for the remaining 15% of unaccounted material. Precipitate observed during the ECH of furfural was identified as a mixture of nickel metal and nickel hydroxide based on the analysis results from inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (not shown). Ongoing oxidation of the nickel anode (Eq. (12)) raised the nickel ion (Ni2+) concentration while cathodic proton consumption raised the OH− concentration during electrolysis, leading to precipitation of nickel hydroxide. In addition, it was noted that under vigorous stirring conditions, nickel deposited on the cathode surface (Eq. (13)) could flake off to become part of the precipitated particles. (12) Ni(anode,s)→Ni2+ +2e− (13) Ni2+ +2e− →Ni(cathode,s) After filtration, the precipitate was suspended into methanol and the solution was sonicated. Analysis of the resulting solution by GC/MS showed that organic species were adsorbed onto this precipitate, another reason for the mass loss. Despite incomplete closure of the mass balance, the data in Table 2 suffice to demonstrate the utility of ECH of furfural. In the following experiments, only the organic compounds in the solution were used in mass balance calculations."
8,Effect of electrodes,"3.2 Effect of electrodes Both pure nickel and nickel–iron alloy were tested as sacrificial anodes for the ECH of furfural. Iron is the more easily oxidized metal, and the alloy's behavior might differ from that of the pure metals [20]. However, the results (Fig. 3 ) for the two anode materials revealed no obvious differences in performance. Therefore, to avoid irrelevant complexity, pure nickel was used as anode material in all subsequent investigations. For ECH of organic compounds, the catalytic cathode material was the key component in terms of product selectivity and electrochemical efficiency. In an undivided cell with a nickel sacrificial anode, nickel deposit was formed onto the cathode surface due to the reduction of nickel ion (Ni2+), as shown in Eq. (13). Thus, both the original cathode surface material and the new deposited nickel layer may affect the ECH of furfural. To differentiate between the original cathode material and the influence of the nickel deposition, a divided H-cell was used with iron as the cathode and pure nickel as the anode. A Nafion membrane 117 was used to separate the two chambers and thus prevent nickel deposition on the Fe cathode. The divided H-cell had significantly lower furfuryl alcohol yield and electrochemical efficiency than the undivided cell (Fig. 4 ). In the undivided cell, the nickel deposits, examined by SEM, were in the μm range, resulting in relatively large surface area compared with the plain iron cathode in the divided cell. This is a possible reason for the better performance of the undivided cell. Important information can be obtained from this experiment: (a) the iron cathode alone without deposited nickel was electrochemically active for ECH of furfural, and (b) the deposition of nickel clearly enhanced the cathode's activity. The effects of several additional cathode materials on product yields and electrochemical efficiency for furfuryl alcohol and 2-methylfuran formation were studied. These materials included Ni, Fe, Cu, 308 SS and Al. As can be seen in Fig. 5 , the furfuryl alcohol yield increased in the order: Al<308 SS≤Cu<Ni≤Fe. As for 2-methylfuran, Ni, Cu and 308 SS were slightly better than Fe and Al, but the differences were small. Electrochemical efficiencies for different cathode materials were also calculated and increased in the same order as the yields (Fig. 5). Vilar et al. [21] stated that the cathode had practically no effect on the electrochemical efficiency during ECH of cyclohexanone, isophorone and acetylcyclohexene using a Ni sacrificial anode, but the results for ECH of furfural did show substantial differences. The reason for this difference was that Vilar et al. used pre-electrolysis to deposit nickel on the cathode material before adding organic compounds. In this investigation, pre-electrolysis was not used; instead, furfural was added to the solution at the beginning of the electrolysis. Without pre-electrolysis, there was no nickel deposited at the onset of reaction, and the unmodified cathode material contributed to the catalytic effect on the ECH of furfural. Later, when deposition of nickel had taken place for some time, the deposited nickel became the predominant catalyst for converting furfural. Over the course of ECH of furfural in the undivided cell, both the naked cathode and the deposited nickel contributed to the observed product yield and efficiency."
9,pH effect,"3.3 pH effect Besides changing the electrode materials, the pH of the experimental solution was another important parameter affecting the ECH of furfural. It is expected that pH should affect the competition between hydrogenation of furfural (Eqs. (3)–(5)) and desorption of Hads (hydrogen evolution: Eqs (6) and (7)). The pH should have little effect on the thermal desorption of Hads (Eq. (6)) but should have a pronounced effect on its electrochemical desorption (Eq. (7)) because it involves H2O (neutral and alkaline pH) or H3O+ (acidic pH) in the process. Different pH conditions (pH 1.0, 5.0 and 9.5) were investigated for ECH of furfural (100mM) using pure nickel as cathode and anode. The standard solution of water, methanol and NH4Cl used in these experiments has a pH 5.0. HCl was added to the above solution to change the pH to 1.0, while NH4OH (aqueous ammonia) was used to adjust the solution to pH 9.5. The effect of pH on furfural conversion, product selectivity, yield, electrochemical efficiency and the material balance are shown in Table 3 . The conversion of furfural at pH 1.0 was much lower than that at pH 5.0 and 9.5. As shown in Eq. (7), lowering pH (i.e. raising hydronium ion concentration) should raise the hydrogen evolution rate at the expense of furfural conversion and electrochemical efficiency. It was interesting that the selectivity of 2-methylfuran was increased as pH 1.0. To further enhance selectivity to 2-methylfuran, even more acidic conditions than pH 1.0 could be employed, but besides further loss of current to H2 formation, acid catalyzed polymerization of furfuryl alcohol would then be expected. The overall electrochemical efficiency based on the two products was highest at pH 5.0. At lower pH, the competitive reaction (Eqs. (6) and (7)) for hydrogen evolution was favored because of the high hydronium ion concentration. At higher pH 9.5, the hydrogenation reaction should be favored over the hydrogen evolution. However, the pH of the solution changed from 9.5 to 11 during the electrolysis. Furfural was not stable at this alkaline condition and the concentration of furfural decreased, which has been examined using control experiments (data not shown here). The decrease of furfural concentration lowered the reaction rate of furfural hydrogenation, thus resulting in lower furfural conversion and electrochemical efficiency (Table 3), which can also be observed in Figs. 6 and 7 ."
10,Influence of starting reactant concentration,"3.4 Influence of starting reactant concentration Different starting concentrations of furfural were chosen to study their effects on the electrochemical efficiency, furfural conversion and product yield during ECH. As shown in Fig. 6, the electrochemical efficiency was maximized when the starting concentration was 100mM. As the concentration was reduced below 100mM, the hydrogenation reaction (Eq. (4)) became slower so that hydrogen evolution became more competitive. When the concentration of furfural is large, hydrogenation should be favored relative to the hydrogen evolution reaction. However, more precipitate was observed at larger furfural concentrations because more electrons were passed and more nickel ion was produced. Additionally, more organic species were adsorbed onto the precipitate particles, thus reducing material balance closure (Fig. 6). Because of the loss of product species as evidenced by the mass balance, the calculated electrochemical efficiency at 200mM was smaller than that at 100mM. As shown in Fig. 7, furfural conversion increased slightly as the starting furfural concentration increased. Furfuryl alcohol and 2-methylfuran yields showed a maximum at 50mM and 100mM, respectively (Fig. 7)."
11,Effect of current density,"3.5 Effect of current density Current density, directly related to the total reaction rate, may have an effect on the electrochemical efficiency and product yield. Several different current densities in the range of 300–1200mA/dm2 were studied. Results showed that the electrochemical efficiency decreased when increasing the current density from 300 to 1200mA/dm2 (Fig. 8 ). An optimum current density usually exists for ECH of organic compounds [14,18]. When the current density is smaller than this optimum value, the surface coverage of the Hads is smaller. The probability of the collision between Hads and (furfural)ads is lower, and the electrochemical desorption of Hads (Eq. (7)) is important, resulting in a smaller electrochemical efficiency. When the current density is higher than the optimum value, the adsorption sites M are saturated with Hads, so no matter how the current density is increased, the hydrogenation of furfural (Eq. (4)) and thermochemical desorption of Hads (Eq. (6)) are not affected. However, higher current density would result in a more negative cathode potential, thus increasing the electrochemical desorption rate of Hads (Eq. (7)) and decreasing the electrochemical efficiency. The lowest current density 300mA/dm2 studied in this paper may exceed the optimum current density, thus a continuous decrease of electrochemical efficiency was observed."
12,Competitive reaction kinetics,"3.6 Competitive reaction kinetics Furfural is usually produced by acid hydrolysis of biomass residues, such as corn cobs, corn stover, rice straw, wheat straw, forest slash and sawdust. Organic compounds derived from cellulose or lignin may compete with furfural hydrogenation. Competitive ECH of furfural with benzaldehyde, also an aromatic aldehyde, was therefore studied. Fig. 9 shows reactant concentrations vs. time for the ECH of a mixture comprising 80mM furfural and 80mM benzaldehyde. Slopes of the resulting linear fits represent conversion rates on the nickel catalyst; these rates were very similar for furfural and benzaldehyde at 9.7 and 9.4mM/h, respectively, consistent with their common character as aromatic aldehydes. The total of 19.1mM/h conversion rate in the 50mL sample volume was affected by a 133mA current, yielding an overall electrochemical efficiency of 37.3%, similar to those found in the single substrate experiments. Thus, neither selectivity difference nor interference is seen between these two substrates."
13,Conclusions,"Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of furfural was accomplished using an undivided electrolytic cell with a sacrificial anode immersed in aqueous solution. Furfuryl alcohol and 2-methylfuran were the major and minor products, respectively. Pure nickel and nickel alloy anode materials behaved similarly in terms of product selectivity. Conversely, the cathode material had a large effect on the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of furfural, with nickel and iron giving the best results among those studied. In this system, nickel deposition improved the activity and selectivity of the original cathode. Without pre-electrolysis during electrocatalytic hydrogenation of furfural, both the original cathode material and deposited nickel contributed to the catalytic effect. The pH of the solution also affected product selectivities and electrochemical efficiency. Furfuryl alcohol had an optimum yield at pH 5.0, while 2-methylfuran was favored at pH 1.0. As current density increased, furfuryl alcohol yield and electrochemical efficiency were decreased. In direct competition, ECH reaction rates of furfural and of benzaldehyde were similar, with no signs of mutual interference. Vaart et al. [22] stated that atomic hydrogen concentration at the catalyst surface can be controlled and maintained by the applied potential. This allows the operation of the ECH process at ambient pressures compared with the extremely high hydrogen pressure in catalytic hydrogenation. Based on this investigation, electrocatalytic hydrogenation of furfural using a sacrificial anode could be a very promising process for furfuryl alcohol production."
