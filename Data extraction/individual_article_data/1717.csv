0,Introduction,"Challenges of sustainable development have driven researchers to seek abundant natural resources to replace fossil derivatives. Biomass exhibiting a low carbon footprint is an alternative valuable starting material to produce chemicals and liquid fuels [1-2]. Monomers presenting in lignocellulose biomass are attractive sources of platform molecules such as furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, which are prepared via dehydration reactions of sugar residues [3-6]. Furfural, which is synthesized by dehydrating lignocellulose (with an annual production volume of >200,000 tones in industry), is an important platform chemical [7, 8]. Therefore, the efficient use of furfural and its derivatives has become a hot spot in studies in the last two decades. Acetal compounds prepared using furfural and alcohols via acetalization reactions are used as bioadditives and raw materials to synthesize pharmaceuticals, polymers, fragrances, and solvents [9, 10]. In conventional industrial processes, acetalization reactions are mainly catalyzed using strong mineral acid, such as H2SO4 and HCl, which are highly corrosive environmental pollutants, that cannot be easily separated from the resulting products [11-13]. To overcome these shortcomings, several environment-friendly and efficient catalysts have been produced, including Lewis acid and heterogeneous, such as La(NO3)3•6H2O [14], bismuth subnitrate [15], anhydrous CeCl3 [16], heteropolyacids [9,17], zeolites [10, 18], acid ion-exchange resins, acid-modified H-ZSM-5, and K-10 clays [19]. Because of their multiple advantages, including suitable acid–base properties, high surface area, adjustable pore diameter, and bulk production ability, zeolites are widely used as catalysts in the chemical industry. Thus, zeolites provide exciting opportunities for the acetalization of furfural with alcohols. In this study, we investigated catalytic properties of zeolites, such as SAPO-11(Si 2.8 wt.%), SAPO-34 (Si 6.9 wt.%), USY (Si/Al = 6/1 and 11/1), HY (Si/Al = 2.5–6/1) and H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 70/1, 170/1, 500/1), in acetalization of furfural with different alcohols. The main goal of investigation was to reveal impact of structure and chemical composition of zeolite on the reaction rates and distribution of products. The textural structure of the catalysts was characterized in detail using N2 adsorption–desorption (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller, BET) isotherms, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD). SAPO-34 showed the highest catalytic activity and afforded high yields. Based on the results of characterization and reactions, a structure–function relationship was proposed. The substrate scope and catalyst recyclability were also investigated. Additionally, the thermodynamic parameter (ΔG) and equilibrium constant of acetalization (K) between furfural and different alcohols were calculated to reveal the reason for the difference in catalytic performance."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The furfural in this work was of analytical grade and purified by distillation before use. Other chemicals, i.e., 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-propanediol, glycol, methanol, ethanol, and propyl alcohol, were analytical reagents and used without any additional treatment. The zeolites SAPO-34(Si 6.9 wt.%), SAPO-11(Si 2.8 wt.%), USY(6) (Si/Al = 6/1), USY(11) (Si/Al = 11/1), NaY(Si/Al = 2.5-6/1), H-ZSM-5(500) (Si/Al = 500/1), H-ZSM-5(170) (Si/Al = 170/1), and H-ZSM-5(70) (Si/Al = 70/1) were purchased from Nanjing XFNAON Materials Tech Co., Ltd. The zeolites were calcined at 550 °C for 4 h in air before use."
3,Preparation of HY,"2.2 Preparation of HY Typically, 1 M NH4Cl solution (200 mL) was blended with NaY (20 g) over a water bath at 80 °C and stirred for 12 h. The product was filtered, completely rinsed with water, and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Then, it was calcined in air at 550 °C for 4 h. The aforementioned procedures were repeatedly three times."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were evaluated using the Micromeritics 3Flex adsorption analyzer at liquid N2 temperature (77 K). Before measurements, the samples were pretreated under vacuum (p < 10−5 mbar) at 350 °C for 12 h. The microporosity is defined as the ratio of Vmicro/Vtotal, which represent the volume of micropore and total pores in catalysts, respectively. XRD pattern were documented using the Panalytical X'PERT PRO X-ray diffractometer under ambient conditions at 40 mA. All XRD patterns were recorded for the 2θ values of 4°–60° with a step size of 0.02° and a time step of 4°/min. SEM images were measured using a Hitachi SU8010 microscope at 5.0 kV. The acidity of the zeolites was assessed using NH3-TPD by employing an AutoChem 2910 analyzer. The samples were treated at 300 °C using a He stream (30 mL/min) for 1 h. After cooling to 50 °C, the samples were exposed to NH3 flow (30 mL/min) for 60 min, followed by linear heating to 800 °C at 10 °C/min. NH3 desorption was investigated using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD)."
5,Typical acetalization reaction,"2.4 Typical acetalization reaction The acetalization of furfural with alcohols was realized in a glass tube using a magnetic stirrer at a stirring speed of 500 r/min. In a typical reaction, zeolite, furfural (2.4 g, 25 mmol), and alcohol were added to the reaction tube. After flushing three times using N2 (1.5 MPa) under ambient temperature, the reaction mixture was heated to the required temperature, which was retained constant during the entire process. After the reaction was completed, the glass tube was cooled to room temperature and the catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture through centrifugation. Both liquid products and substrate were analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) (Agilent 7890A/5975C) equipped with an HP-5MS capillary column and GC (Agilent 6890) with an SE-54 capillary column. Agilent 6890 GC adopted the flame ionization detector (FID). The quantitative analysis for GC was conducted using the internal standard method; a certain amount of furanidine was taken as the internal standard sample before GC analysis. For the recycling of catalyst, zeolite was isolated from reaction mixture by filtration, washed with ethanol for 3 times to remove the residual substrate and product, and then reused in the following cycle after drying in vacuum (70 °C, 5.3 kPa for 6 h)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 N2 adsorption–desorption Analysis of the zeolite surface area, pore volume, and average pore diameter was conducted using N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms. Fig. S1 shows the resulting isotherms. The curve of SAPO-34 showed a representative Type I isotherm containing a weak H1 hysteresis loop at a relative pressure (P/P0) of 0.4 − 0.8, which is characteristic of a microporous structure (Fig. S1(a)) [20, 21]. The BET surface area and pore diameter of SAPO-34 were 724 m2/g and 1.71 nm, respectively. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the SAPO-11, USY-(6), USY-(11), HY, and H-ZSM-5 zeolite samples were all identified to be Type IV isotherms [22, 23], thus mainly indicating typical microporous and mesoporous characteristics. SAPO-11 exhibited clear hysteresis loops at P/P0 of 0.1–1.0 (Fig. S1(a)), whereas USY(6), USY(11), HY, and H-ZSM-5 showed the H1 hysteresis loop at a P/P0 of 0.4 − 0.95 (Fig. S1(b) and S1(c)). The sample surface area was measured using the BET equation and the pore size was calculated using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) technique (Table 1 ). The BET surface areas of HY and USY zeolites are higher (≥850 m2/g) than those of H-ZSM-5 (370—410 m2/g) and SAPO (183 or 724 m2/g). The total pore volumes of all tested zeolites have unobvious variation, which are merely between 0.23 and 0.43 cm3/g. Simultaneously, the average pore width and microporosity of zeolites mentioned except for SAPO-11 are amongst 1.7~2.3 nm and >0.9, respectively. The average pore width and microporosity of SAPO-11 zeolite reached to 7.0 nm and 0.52, which were also verified by the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms shown in Fig. S1. 3.1.2 X-Ray diffraction (XRD) Fig. 1 shows the powder XRD patterns of the various zeolites. The XRD pattern of SAPO-34 revealed diffraction peaks at 2θ = 9.6°, 16.1°, 20.5°, 26.2°, and 30.9°, attributed to the structure of chabazite (CHA) (Fig. 1(a)) [20, 21, 24]. Representative diffraction peaks of SAPO-11 were observed at 2θ = 8.1°, 9.5°, 13.1°, 15.5°, 20.3°, 21.0°, and 22.1–23.4°, attributed to the structure of AEL; the abovementioned structures were typical for these two zeolites of molecular sieves [23]. The three most intense diffraction peaks at 6.3°, 15.7°, and 23.7° confirmed the presence of a characteristic faujasite structure of zeolite Y, according to the Structure Commission of the International Zeolite Association (Fig. 1(b)) [25]. Fig. 1(c) shows the XRD patterns of H-ZSM-5. revealing specific peaks at 2θ = 7.94°, 8.88°, 23.08°, 23.32°, and 23.95° [26-28], which is indicative of H-ZSM-5 zeolite crystals. 3.1.3 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The surface morphology of various zeolite samples was investigated using SEM; the SEM images are presented in Fig. 2 . The SEM image of SAPO-34 (Fig. 2(a)) revealed regular cubes with a crystal size of 1.5–3.0 µm, which is a typical feature of the CHA structure and is consistent with the XRD results. SAPO-11 exhibited irregular polyhedral particles with an average size of 1.0–3.0 μm (Fig. 2(b)). The SEM images of USY(6), USY(11), and HY (Fig. 2(c)–(e), respectively) revealed that these zeolites exhibited a typical faujasite morphology [29]. The morphology of H-ZSM-5 zeolite powders was also observed using SEM. Fig. 2(f)–(h) show the representative shape of H-ZSM-5 zeolite nanocrystals; the nanocrystal particles were distributed uniformly, and the average particle size was approximately 0.2–1.0 µm. 3.1.4 Acidity analysis Acidity is an important property of zeolites. Therefore, the surface acidity of SAPO, USY, HY, and H-ZSM series was measured using NH3-TPD. All the evaluated samples exhibited two desorption peaks (Fig. 3 ), i.e., a desorption peak at a low temperature (~110 °C) belonging to the weak acid site and the other peak at high temperatures (300 °C–500 °C) belonging to medium and strong acid sites [30]. SAPO-34 showed the highest peak intensity at 300 °C–500 °C, indicating that this zeolite exhibited the most medium and strong acid sites among all other zeolites. The strength of the acid sites depended on the peak area. Table 2 lists relevant findings. USY and HY exhibited the largest amount of total acid sites (>2.4 mmol/g), while SAPO-34 showed the largest amount of medium and strong acid sites (0.64 mmol/g) (Table 2). The total acid amount of SAPO-34 was 1.75 mmol/g."
8,Performance of zeolite catalysts,"3.2 Performance of zeolite catalysts The catalytic performance of the acetalization of furfural with 1,2-propanediol into 2-(furan-2-yl)−4-methyl-1,3-dioxolane (FMD) was investigated using different zeolites (SAPO-34, SAPO-11, USY(6), USY(11), HY, H-ZSM-5(70), H-ZSM-5(170), and H-ZSM-5(500)) under solvent-free conditions at 80 °C. Table 3 presents relevant findings. In the absence of catalyst, only 64.8% FMD yield was obtained at 80 °C for 6 h (Table 3, entry 9). Next, experiments were conducted over the H-forms of commercial zeolites. All the samples of the SAPO series yielded 82.3%–88.2% FMD (Table 3, entries 1–2), with SAPO-34 that exhibits a microporous structure achieving the maximum yield (88.2%) among all the observed zeolites. The gross amount of acid sites of H-zeolites was measured by NH3-TPD, and the results are presented in Table 2. SAPO-34 showed the highest number of medium and strong acid sites, suggesting the necessity to complete the expected reaction using an acid catalyst. However, when SAPO-11 exhibiting a small number of acid sites and a small surface area was used as the catalyst under the same conditions, 82.3% yield FMD was afforded. USY and HY yielded 69.9%–81.9% FMD (Table 3, entries 3–5), with USY(11) obtaining the highest yield (81.9%) compared with USY-(6) and HY and HY showing the lowest catalytic activity (Y = 69.9%). This is mainly attributed to acidity and the pore structure of zeolites. For USY(11), the gross amount of acid sites was estimated using NH3-TPD (2.72 mmol/g) and it was the largest among the tested samples. Furthermore, the total pore volume and pore diameter of USY are larger than those of HY, which promoted accessibility of substrate to active sites and diffusion of products into bulk solution. Moreover, the zeolites of H-ZSM-5 were used to compare the same zeolite structure under varying Si/Al ratios; apparent discrepancies were observed. H-ZSM-5 exhibited FMD yields in the range of 75.1%–80.7% (Table 3, entries 6–8). The FMD yield improved when the Si/A1 ratio in H-ZSM-5 was increased, and the gross amount of acid sites decreased with an increase in Si/A1 ratio. The Si/A1molar ratio is the major factor controlling the acid strength of zeolites. Indeed, it is known that the strength of a given acid site depends on the number of Al atoms present in the next nearest neighbours, the stronger centres being those that exhibit smaller numbers of Al atoms in the next nearest neighbours [31, 32]. Therefore, it is obvious that H-ZSM-5 with higher Si/A1 ratio presenting stronger acid centres exhibited optimal catalytic activity in the acetalization of furfural with 1,2-propanediol. According to above discussion, the amounts of acid sites on zeolite surface play an important role in enhancing catalytic performance of acetalization of furfural with 1,2-propanediol. Additionally, although the amounts of acid sites on SAPO-11 and H-ZSM-5(70) zeolites are similar, the higher yield FMD was achieved over the former. This finding is probably attributed to the larger average pore diameter and lower microporosity given in Table 1, which is beneficial to the diffusion of substrates and products. SAPO-34 was selected to observe the effect of different reaction parameters. The reaction parameters, including catalyst concentration, molar ratio of 1,2-propanediol to furfural, temperature, as well as duration, were investigated in detail. Table 4 lists the relevant findings. Generally, the concentration of the catalyst was confirmed to be a major parameter affecting the reaction. The FMD yield steadily increased from 79.8% to 88.2% as the catalyst loading was increased from 6 wt.% to 10 wt.% (Table 4, entries 1–3). However, when the catalyst loading was further increased to 12 wt%, the FMD yield decreased to 84.3% (Table 4, entry 4). This behavior indicates that the reaction reached equilibrium when the catalyst loading was increased to 10 wt.%, and excess acid may enhance the side reaction [10, 33]. Additionally, the molar ratio of 1,2-propanediol to furfural remarkably affected the reaction. The FMD yield rapidly improved with an increase in the molar ratio of 1,2-propanediol to furfural from 4:1 to 8:1 and reached 88.2% at the molar ratio of 1,2-propanediol to furfural of 8:1 and then remained constant (Table 4, entries 3 and 5–7). The reaction temperature considerably affected the acetalization reaction. With an increase in the reaction temperature from 60 °C to 100 °C, the FMD yield first increased, then decreased, and approached a maximum (88.2%) when the reaction temperature was 80 °C (Table 4, entry 3). However, when the temperature was further increased to 100 °C, the yield decreased to 79.1% (Table 4, entry 10). The effect of reaction time, ranging from 4 to 8 h, was also explored (Table 4, entries 3 and 11–12). The FMD yield gradually increased from 79.9% to 88.2% when the reaction time was increased from 4 to 6 h. When the reaction time was further increased, the FMD yield slightly decreased. Hence, the optimum reaction time was determined to be 6 h. To improve the acetalization reaction, we screened several alcohols, including 1,3-propanediol, glycol, methanol, ethanol, and propyl alcohol, by reacting them with furfural using SAPO-34 at 80 °C; the results are presented in Table 5 . The acetalization of 1,3-propanediol with furfural afforded a furfural acetal yield of 96.3% (Table 5, entry 1). Further, the reaction of 1,2-propanediol with furfural afforded its acetal derivative with a yield of 88.2% (Table 5, entry 2). The acetalization of furfural with glycol afforded the acetalization product with a yield of 76.5% (Table 5, entry 3). Monohydroxyl alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol, and propyl alcohol, was also used as the reaction material to investigate the acetalization of furfural. A 74.5% yield of acetal was obtained when methanol was used as the reaction material. The reaction activity decreased as the carbon chain length in monohydroxyl alcohol increased. The free Gibbs energies (ΔG) of the acetalization of furfural with different alcohols at 80 °C were calculated using VASP 6.1 with the PBE-D3, 400-eV truncation energy method and are presented in Table 5. Free Gibbs energies of each species were calculated by the following equation: (1) G = E DFT + E ZPE − k B × T × l n q v i b where E DFT and E ZPE = 1 2 ∑ i h v i are denoted to the DFT energy and zero point energy (ZPE), respectively. q v i b represents the vibrational partion function. Each vibrational mode is labelled by i. The vibrational partion function was calculated as follows: (2) q v i b = ∏ i 1 1 − e h v i k B T To reduce the error of small vibrational frequencies, we shifted all frequencies below 100 cm−1 to 100 cm−1 [34, 35]. The balance constant value (K) was obtained using the formula of ΔrGm = −R × T × lnK. With a decrease in ΔrGm , the K value gradually increased and the yield of furfural acetals increased, mainly due to the fact that the reaction is easier to proceed with an increase in the K value for an equilibrium reaction. Finally, the reusability and sustained activity of SAPO-34 in the acetalization reaction between furfural and 1,3-propanediol were studied. During every cycle, SAPO-34 was isolated from the reaction mixture through filtration and reused in the following cycle after drying in vacuum (70 °C, 5.3 kPa for 6 h). Fig. 4 presents the relevant findings. The obtained results demonstrated that the catalyst maintained good performance after six runs, affording a furfural acetal yield of 95.8%–96.3%. These results indicated that SAPO-34 possessed excellent stability and reusability without showing any structural damage. The hydroxyl group on the zeolite may form hydrogen bond with the byproduct water during the reaction process. SAPO-34 zeolite can be regenerated by vacuum dehydration, and the acid sites do not decrease, as the loss of acid sites would reduce the catalyst performance [10, 18, 36]."
9,Conclusions,"In conclusion, multiple commercial microporous and mesoporous zeolites were characterized and used for the acetalization reaction between furfural and alcohols for generating furfural acetals. SAPO-34 exhibited the best catalytic activity for acetalization and afforded a high FMD yield (88.2%) at 80 °C for 6 h. Different alcohols were selected to react with furfural to extend the scope of acetalization reaction. Additionally, the catalyst reusability and sustained activity of the zeolite were studied and the catalyst maintained good performances even after being used six times. Thus, it was demonstrated that SAPO-34 was a significant and promising catalyst in acetalization showing bright prospects for industrial applications."
