0,Introduction,"Syngas, derived from natural (shale) gas, coal, biomass, CO2, and even carbon-containing waste, is of great importance in the utilization of nonpetroleum carbon resources for sustainable replacement of diminishing crude oil. The transformation of syngas to higher alcohols (HAs) has attracted considerable attention in academic and industrial fields towards the production of fuel, fuel additives, and other chemical platforms [1]. Extensive and in-depth studies have been devoted to the synthesis of HAs from syngas [2,3]. To date, various routes for the conversion of syngas to HAs have been developed. Creative works showed that ethanol could be produced through carbonylation of methanol or dimethyl ether and subsequent hydrogenation of the corresponding acetic acid or methyl acetate [4–6]. However, this process involves multiple catalytic steps. More recently, a tandem catalysis for direct syngas transformation has attracted increasing interest because it could effectively decouple an intricate reaction network into multiple controllable reaction channels [7]. One such method is the integration of methanol synthesis, methanol carbonylation, and acetic acid hydrogenation [8]. Another method is so-called coupling with hydroformylation: syngas → HAs + olefins → C2+−oxygenates [9]. However, the direct transformation of syngas to HAs is expected to be a promising process due to its low cost, simple reaction steps, and low energy consumption. Despite numerous efforts to design novel catalysts, such as RhMn/Fe/Co, MoS/P/N, CuCo/Fe, and K-modified CuZnAl, to overcome the limited activity and poor durability [10–15], much work is still needed to achieve enhanced activity and stability and a fundamental understanding of the correlation between the catalyst structure and activity. Transition metal carbides (TMCs), which are produced by insertion of carbon atoms into the parent metals, are appealing as alternative materials for precious metals [16]. TMCs are widely applied in many important reactions, such as reforming, hydrogenation, water–gas shift, and CO oxidation [17–19]. Their superior performance is a result of their low activation energy barriers for the activation of C–O bonds [20,21]. Dong et al. [22] studied Au/MoCx catalysts in water–gas shift reactions and found a strong interfacial charge transfer between highly dispersed Au overlayers and TMC supports. Lin et al. investigated low-temperature hydrogen production from methanol steam reforming over Pt/α-MoC [23]. They discovered that well-dispersed Pt maximized the density of active sites. Vidal et al. discovered novel Au/TiC and Cu/TiC catalysts [24]. TiC (001) was beneficial for the dispersion of metals, resulting in the formation of Cu and Au NPs, which are favorable for CO2 activation. Posada-Pérez et al. [25] examined Au/δ-MoC and Cu/δ-MoC catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. The unique strong metal–support interactions (SMSIs) and the configuration and metal/C ratio on the catalyst surface played important roles in the enhanced activity and stability [26–28]. In the previous work, evenly dispersed tungsten carbides with controlled phase compositions were prepared, and they exhibited an impressive capacity for the hydrogenolysis of aryl ether C–O bonds [29,30]. The excellent activity was due to the appropriate configuration and electric properties of surface W and C atoms, and it increased because of the abundant C-defect sites and boundaries. TMCs have also been employed in the synthesis of HAs from syngas recently due to their distinct ability to support metals and their excellent ability to activate C–O bonds [31]. Won et al. [32] synthesized RhMn/WxC and found that SMSIs induced a high dispersion of Rh NPs with an appropriate content of Rh+, thus improving the performance in the synthesis of HAs by syngas. A further in-depth exploration demonstrated that the enhanced productivity of HAs was related to the formation of the W2C phase [33]. Liu et al. [34] used an atomic layer deposition strategy to develop Rh–Mn–WxC/SiO2 catalysts with well-controlled compositions, atomic thicknesses, and high surface areas, affording high activity. Zhang et al. [35] reported that 1% Rh/5c-Mo2C/SiO2 was able to promote the synthesis of HAs and suppress the formation of CH4. TMCs are recognized as promising candidates because of the construction of SMSIs. The small surface area of bulk TMCs that results from high-temperature carburization always induces the minimum exposure of active sites and thus suppresses the catalytic performance. Deactivation of these catalysts due to sintering, phase changes, and coke deposition is another concern. Supports play significant roles on the catalytic performance. They could facilitate metal dispersion, provide special defects, change the morphology of the metallic NPs, modulate basicity and acidity, and even reconstruct exposed surface facets and affect the mechanism through the electronic effect, and so on [36–38]. Among various excellent supports, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted much interest due to their attractive thermal, optical, mechanical, and electrical properties; high surface area; functionalized surfaces; and unique tubular channel. The anchoring effects of CNTs have been extensively studied in heterogeneous catalysis [39–41]. The published works showed that the anchoring effects of CNTs are essential due to the oxygen-containing functional groups [42,43] and confinement effect [44,45]. Simultaneously, the morphology and electronic structure of CNTs enable them to serve as a specific template for preparing TMCs-CNT hybrids as a promising catalyst or support. Gong et al. [46] proposed that CNTs as carriers could suppress the sintering of carbide NPs and avoid excessive carbon deposition on the surface. In the previous work, an ultrastable nanostructured hybrid catalyst formed from a mixture of copper − silica with CNTs was reported [47], exhibiting increased activity and stability. Motivated by these ideas, a series of Rh–WxC/CNT catalysts was successfully synthesized by one-pot carburization of hybrid organic–inorganic precursors in the presence of H2. The obtained Rh–WxC/CNT catalysts were characterized by a series of spectroscopic methods and applied to the synthesis of HAs from syngas. The detailed structural and catalytic studies that addressed the effects of the synergistic effects of WxC and CNTs on the Rh catalyst were shown."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and catalyst preparation,"2.1 Materials and catalyst preparation In this work, CNTs with a diameter of 20–40 nm, a specific surface area of 70–150 m2 g−1, and a length of < 2 µm were purchased from Shenzhen Nano Port Company. Before use, the CNTs were treated with nitric acid (HNO3) to open the tips, and hydrophilic OH and COOH groups were incorporated on the surface. All of the main reagents and solvents, such as rhodium chloride (RhCl3⋅H2O), ammonium metatungstate [(NH4)6H2W12O40⋅nH2O], resorcinol (C6H6O2), and formaldehyde (HCHO), were commercially available and used directly without further purification. The Rh–WxC/CNT catalysts were fabricated by an integrated strategy involving the deposition of metal precursors onto CNTs, polymerization using Stöber method, and rational carburization [29,30]. A similar approach has also been applied in the previous works [29,30]. As shown in Scheme 1 , the tungsten precursor was loaded on purified CNTs, which were further coated by an organic layer via the Stöber method involving the reaction of resorcinol and formaldehyde to produce hydroxymethyl substituted species and then formed an organic layer after aging. Afterwards, the Rh3+ precursor was impregnated onto the organic layer. The organic layer could be decomposed into amorphous carbon in the subsequent carbon thermal reduction step, and these carbon atoms further diffused on the surface and could be inserted into the lattice of the parent tungsten. After controlled carburization was conducted under an atmosphere of H2, W oxide was transformed into WxC, and the catalyst Rh–WxC/CNT was attained. Typically, 140 mg ammonium metatungstate and 125 mg resorcinol (C6H6O2) were dissolved in 150 mL deionized water under vigorous stirring at room temperature, and then 1 g CNTs was dispersed into the above solution, followed by ultrasonication for 1 h. Then, 0.5 mL formaldehyde (HCHO) aqueous solution was added dropwise into the solution under stirring, and the mixture was heated to reflux at 85 °C for 24 h. The obtained pale yellow powders were collected by centrifugation and washed with ethanol and water before drying at 80 °C for further use. For incorporation of Rh species, 50 mg RhCl3 ⋅ 3H2O, was impregnated onto the aforementioned precursor and dried at 110 °C for 12 h. The obtained brown solid precursor was pyrolyzed and carburized in a tube furnace under V(H2)/V(N2) = 5/95 at 850 °C at a rate of 3 °C min−1 for 3 h. After cooling to room temperature, the samples were carefully passivated by V(O2)/V(N2) = 1/99 for 0.5 h. The prepared catalyst was labeled Rh–WxC/CNT. For comparison, Rh species dispersed on a hybrid of carbon spheres (CS) and WxC were synthesized by a similar method with higher amounts of resorcinol (1.2 g) and formaldehyde solution (2.3 mL) in the absence of CNTs. The obtained catalyst was labeled Rh–WxC/CS, where CS was derived from the organic–inorganic hybrid precursor by pyrolysis and carburization. In all cases, the Rh and WxC loadings were fixed at 2% and 10%, respectively."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm was executed on a TriStar II 3020 physical adsorption instrument. The specific surface area and pore volume were calculated using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) methods. Each time, 0.1 g catalyst was used. The samples were placed under vacuum and pretreated at 180 °C for 3 h to remove water. The experiment was performed in liquid nitrogen at –197 °C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out on a PANalytical X’Pert Pro diffractometer using Cu Kα (λ = 0.15406 nm) radiation with a scanning angle from 10° to 90° and a scanning rate of 10° min−1. The tube voltage was 40 kV, and the tube current was 40 mA. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopic data were obtained on an S8-TIGER X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. The test conditions were 60 kV, 40 mA, and V(CH4)/V(He) = 1:99 at a flow rate of 2 mL min−1. Prior to the test, the material and boric acid were dried at 100 °C, mixed at a molar ratio of 1:9, and pressed into tablets. Temperature-programmed desorptions of H2 (H2–TPD) and CO (CO–TPD) were performed on a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 instrument. A 0.1 g sample was placed into a U-shaped tube and reduced in a mixture of V(H2)/V(Ar) = 5:95 at 300 °C for 4 h. After cooling to 50 °C, the feed was shifted to Ar for 30 min to clean the surface. H2 or CO was absorbed for another 1 h after the furnace was gradually cooled to room temperature. Ar was purged to remove the residual H2 or CO until the baseline was stable. The temperature was increased from 50 °C to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1, and the desorption signal was detected by mass spectroscopy or thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Diffused reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was performed on a Bruker VERTEX 70v. The catalyst was placed into an in situ chamber and reduced at 300 °C for 4 h in an atmosphere of V(H2)/V(N2) = 5:95 and then switched to N2 to clean the surface. After cooling to 30 °C, the feed was switched to a mixture of V(CO)/V(N2) = 5:95 for 0.5 h, and then in situ DRIFTS profile were collected. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images were acquired on a FEI Tecnai F30 TEM with an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. A small amount of sample was ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol for 0.5 h at room temperature. The carbon-coated copper grid was dropped into the above solution to obtain the sample. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images were detected on a German Zeiss Sigma SEM instrument and Phenom ProX G6. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Quantum 2000 Scanning ESCA Microprobe instrument equipped with an Al Kα radiation source (hν = 1486.8 eV, 15 kV, 10 mA, and 30 eV) under ultrahigh vacuum of 10−7 Pa. C 1s = 284.6 eV was employed as the standard for calibration."
4,Catalytic performance test,"2.3 Catalytic performance test Synthesis of HAs from syngas was carried out in a fixed-bed microreactor with an inner diameter of 9 mm and a length of 350 mm. The catalyst was compressed and sieved into 40–80 mesh. Each time, 0.2 g catalyst was used and diluted with an equal volume of quartz sand. Prior to the reaction, the precursor was activated under the conditions of V(H2)/V(N2) = 5/95, 30 mL min−1, and 300 °C for 4 h. When the temperature was decreased to 220 °C, syngas [V(H2)/V(CO)/V(N2) = 60/30/10, where N2 was used as the internal standard] was fed into the reactor. The reaction was performed under the reaction conditions of 3.0 MPa and 6000 mL g−1 h−1. The products were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a TCD. The former was filled with a carbon molecular sieve (TDX-01, 1 m) to detect N2, CO, and CO2 and calculate the CO conversion [X(CO)] and selectivity of CO2 [S(CO2)] by the internal standard method. The latter (TG-BOND Q, 30 m × 0.32 mm × 10 μm) was used to analyze the hydrocarbons, alcohols, and other oxygen-containing compounds to calculate the selectivity by an internal normalization method. The calculation formulas of X(CO) and S(CO2) are given by Eqs. (1) and (2) as follows: (1) X CO = 1 - A CO out A N 2 out / A CO i n A N 2 i n (2) S C O 2 = 1 - X X f C O 2 A C O 2 out f CO A CO out The selectivity of hydrocarbons [S(HCs)] and alcohols [S(ROH)] were calculated using Eq. (3) as below: (3) S i = f i A i ∑ 1 n n f C n H 2 n + 2 A C n H 2 n + 2 + ∑ 1 m m f C m H 2 m + 1 O H A C m H 2 m + 1 O H where n and m are the numbers of carbon atoms in hydrocarbons and alcohols, respectively; f and A represent the relative molar correction factor and the peak area of the corresponding component, respectively; and i indicates the product."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Structural characterizations,"3.1 Structural characterizations 3.1.1 Textural properties The Rh loading for Rh–WxC/CNT and Rh–WxC/CS was detected and measured to be 1.92% and 1.89% via ICP-OES measurements, respectively, and these values are basically in line with the theoretical values. Thus, Rh was successfully impregnated into or incorporated on or in the catalysts. The textural properties of WxC/CNT, WxC/CS, and pure CNTs and CS were investigated by N2 isothermal adsorption–desorption, as illustrated in Table 1 . After W and Rh species were incorporated onto CNTs and CS, the BET surface area, average pore size, and volume of the catalysts decreased. This finding implied that either WxC or Rh–WxC deposited onto the surface of CNTs and CS and blocked some pores. A notable detail that the synthesized Rh–WxC/CNT had a BET surface area of 88.1 m2 g−1, a pore diameter of 29.6 nm, and a pore volume of 0.53 cm− 3 g−1, which are larger than those of Rh–WxC/CS, where the values were 46.9 m2 g−1, 3.3 nm, and 0.05 cm− 3 g−1, respectively. 3.1.2 Morphology observation Figs. 1 and 2 illustrate the HRTEM and SEM images of Rh–WxC/CNT and Rh–WxC/CS. As shown in Fig. 1a, the tubular morphology proved the presence of CNTs in Rh–WxC/CNT. The CNTs with nano-sized channel of average diameter at approximately 35 nm and average wall thickness at approximately 10 nm could be explicitly observed, matching well with the HAADF-STEM images in Figs. S2a and S2b. Beside the four represented Rh–WxC NPs that lie in the outer surface of CNTs, two represented Rh–WxC NPs circled by the white circles were clear and distinct (Fig. S2c), indicating that some of Rh–WxC NPs may enter into the channels of CNTs. Therefore, majority of the Rh–WxC NPs was on the exterior surface of the CNTs, while the minority was on the inner channels of CNTs. The species of Rh and WxC entirely overlapped on the same domain of CNTs, implying a strong interaction between Rh and WxC (Fig. 1e, 1f, S1d, and S1e). The NP size distributions ranged from approximately 1.0 nm to 8.0 nm, with an average size of 3.2 nm (Fig. S2d). Lattice distances of 0.227 nm and 0.252 nm were clearly seen in Fig. 1b, corresponding to the (101) facet of W2C and (100) facet of WC, respectively. These results showed that Rh–WxC/CNT with characterized phases of W2C and WC was successfully synthesized. By contrast, Rh–WxC/CS exhibited a different morphology, where the Rh–WxC NPs were located on the surface of CS, as evident from the SEM image in Fig. 2a and S3a. CS presented a spherical morphology, with a diameter of approximately 2–3 μm, as depicted in Fig. 2b. The EDX elemental mapping of Rh–WxC/CS demonstrated the uniform dispersion of Rh and WxC NPs (Fig. 2e and 2f), suggesting a loosening interaction between Rh and WxC. As shown in Fig. S3b, the Rh–WxC NPs embedded in the CS presented an average particle size of 17.4 nm ranging from 7 nm to 25 nm (Fig. S3c). 3.1.3 XRD XRD analysis was further employed to investigate the carbide phase composition. Fig. 3 exhibits the XRD patterns of the synthesized catalysts of Rh–WxC/CNT and Rh–WxC/CS. Apparently, the XRD patterns of Rh–WxC/CNT and Rh–WxC/CS are similar except for the characteristic peak of CNTs located at 2θ = 26.1°. The incorporation of CNTs could not change the phase composition. The characteristic peaks located at 34.4°, 38.0°, and 39.5° were assigned to the (002), (200) and (102) crystal facets of W2C crystals with orthorhombic structures (PDF number: 89–2371). The peaks at 2θ = 31.5°, 35.6°, and 48.3° were attributed to the reflections of (001), (100), and (101) of well-structured hexagonal WC. Therefore, the phases W2C and WC coexisted under the present carburizing conditions. This finding agrees well with the reported works [29,30]. No Rh characteristic peaks could be observed in the two catalysts, even under high carburizing temperatures, presumably due to the SMSI between the Rh and WxC species. Schweitzer et al. [48] synthesized Pt/Mo2C and found that the Pt displayed raft-like particles because of the strong interaction between metal and metal carbides. Rodriguez et al. [49] reported that Au atoms in contact with TiC surface underwent significant charge polarization. Hunts et al. [50,51] demonstrated that the TMCs could stabilize the noble metals with atomic dispersion. Yao et al. [52] also reported that Au/α-MoC with high Au dispersion displayed excellent performance in water gas shift reaction. These results revealed the importance of SMSI effect between the metal species and TMCs, resulting in high dispersion of metals. However, the magnitude of the corresponding peaks of Rh–WxC/CNT was obviously smaller than that of Rh–WxC/CS, indicating a smaller particle size in Rh–WxC/CNT. According to the Scherrer equation, the average crystallite sizes of W2C and WC were estimated to be 3.1 and 2.9 nm for Rh–WxC/CNT, respectively, while those for Rh–WxC/CS were approximately 19.7 and 16.2 nm, respectively. These results agreed well with the TEM images. Therefore, incorporation of CNTs into the Rh–WxC compound could greatly improve the dispersion, which favors generating a high concentration of active species and results in enhanced catalytic performance. 3.1.4 XPS XPS was used to identify the chemical states of the surface species over the catalysts. Fig. 4 shows a comparison of the XPS profiles of Rh–WxC/CNT and Rh–WxC/CS. In the C 1s spectrum of Rh–WxC/CNT in Fig. 4a, the dominant peaks corresponding to C–C sp2, C–C sp3, C–O, and C–C=O [53,54] are typical peaks of CNTs. However, carbides could not be clearly detected, probably due to the overlap between carbides and CNTs. The deconvoluted C 1 s spectra of Rh–WxC/CS (Fig. 4b) were distinct from those of Rh–WxC/CNT. The peaks located at 282.3 and 284.1 eV could be attributed to carbidic C and graphitic C [29,30], respectively. This finding implied successful carburization. For the conversion of syngas to HAs, Rh0 facilitates CO dissociation, while CO association and insertion occur on the Rh+ active site to form C2-oxygenate intermediates. Therefore, calculating the Rh+/Rh0 molar ratio is of great importance. In the present work, Rh 3d XPS (Fig. 4c and 4d) was performed to study the correlation between structure and performance. Quantitative XPS analysis was conducted to investigate the state of Rh. Three chemical states were observed on the surfaces of the catalysts: Rh0, Rh+, and Rh3+ [55,56]. The existence of the high-valent state of Rh was due to the outstanding interaction between the metal and support. The surface molar ratio of Rh+/Rh0 in Rh–WxC/CNT was calculated to be 0.56 (Table S1). By contrast, the molar ratio of Rh+/Rh0 in Rh–WxC/CS was determined to be 0.33. The Rh+/Rh0 ratio in Rh–WxC/CNT was higher than that in Rh–WxC/CS, probably indicating that the interaction of Rh and WxC species differed between the two catalysts. In other words, stronger interactions may exist in the case of nanostructured WxC and Rh species on the surfaces of CNTs compared with the case of larger-sized WxC and Rh species on Rh–WxC/CS. The construction of stronger Rh–WxC interactions may be beneficial for the stability of Rh+ species. Fig. 4e and 4f display the W 4f XPS profiles of Rh–WxC/CNT and Rh–WxC/CS. No obvious differences were found. According to the works reported, two pronounced peaks located at 31.5 and 33.7 eV were assigned to the WxC species, implying successful carburization. Two small peaks centered at 35.3 and 37.2 eV were attributed to the W–O species [57,58], because the nanostructured WxC could be easily oxidized into WOx during passivation by 1% O2/99% N2. 3.1.5 CO–TPD and H2–TPD CO–TPD and H2–TPD were performed to elucidate the adsorption behavior of H2 and CO, as demonstrated in Fig. 5 . Two desorption peaks of CO were found in Rh–WxC/CNT and Rh–WxC/CS (Fig. 5a). The low-temperature peak centered at approximately 91 °C could be attributed to the weak CO adsorption sites. The high-temperature peak ranging from 550 °C to 600 °C could be ascribed to the strong CO adsorption sites. Notably, the high-temperature CO desorption peak was located at approximately 555 °C for the Rh–WxC/CNT sample. Nonetheless, the corresponding desorption curve of Rh–WxC/CS lies at approximately 588 °C. This redshift indicated that CO adsorption/desorption was much easier and more preferential than Rh–WxC/CNT. Simultaneously, the peak areas progressively increased after incorporation of CNTs instead of CS, indicating abundant adsorption sites over Rh–WxC/CNT. For H2–TPD in Fig. 5b, two H2 desorption peaks could be observed in these two compared samples. Rh–WxC/CNT showed H2 desorption peaks centered at approximately 418 °C and 599 °C. The peak areas were higher than those of Rh–WxC/CS. TPD of Rh–WxC/CNT and Rh–WxC/CS was performed without adsorption of H2 and CO ro further prove the H2–TPD and CO–TPD signals due to the desorption of H2 and CO, respectively. As depicted in Fig. S4, no obvious desorption peaks were observed. These results indicated that the desorption peaks of H2–TPD and CO–TPD could be attributed to the desorption of H2 and CO over Rh–WxC/CNT and Rh–WxC/CS, respectively. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 5, CS alone had no distinct adsorptions of H2 and CO, while the pristine CNTs showed weak adsorption of H2 and CO. The results revealed that the addition of CNTs to Rh–WxC may enhance the CO and H2 adsorption/desorption ability, which is conductive to CO hydrogenation. 3.1.6 DRIFTS DRIFTS measurement was performed to investigate the types of active sites and CO absorption on the surface, and the results are shown in Fig. 6 . For C-containing materials, five absorption peaks could be observed for the Rh–WxC/CNT and Rh–WxC/CS catalysts [59]. The two peaks at around 2160 and 2100 cm−1 could be ascribed to the H-bonded CO and gas phase CO [60], respectively. The CO adsorption on Rh sites has three main kinds [59,60]. As shown in Fig. 6, a band located at approximately 2050 cm−1 could be attributed to the linearly adsorbed CO [CO(L)] on Rh0. The doublet bands at approximately 2070 and 2005 cm−1 could be attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric carbonyl stretching of gem-dicarbonyl CO on the Rh+ sites, namely, Rh+(CO)2 [CO(Gdc)]. The slight redshift may be due to the influence of carbon materials [59]. In Rh-based catalysts, assessing the molar ratio of Rh+ and Rh0 is critical. HAs could be synthesized by CO insertion into –CHx species to form C2+–intermediates, where CO is in the form of CO(Gdc) absorbed on the Rh+ sites. Unfortunately, the molar ratio of Rh+/Rh0 for Rh–WxC/CNT and Rh–WxC/CS could not be estimated because of the overlapping peaks of CO [CO(Gdc)] and [CO(L)]. Nevertheless, the peak area clearly attributed to the CO adsorption on Rh–WxC/CNT was apparently larger than that for Rh–WxC/CS, indicating that it is preferential for the synthesis of HAs over Rh–WxC/CNT. This finding agrees well with the results of CO–TPD characterization. Interestingly, the peak due to CO [CO(B)] (bridged-CO adsorbed on the two adjacent Rh atoms) at approximately 1870 cm−1 was not observed in these two compared catalysts, implying the absence of bulk Rh NPs and the higher dispersion of Rh, consistent with the XRD results."
7,Catalytic performance,"3.2 Catalytic performance The catalytic performance for the conversion of syngas to HAs was evaluated in a fixed-bed reactor under the reaction conditions of T = 220 °C, P = 3.0 MPa, V(H2)/V(CO)/V(N2) = 60/30/10, and GHSV = 6000 mL g−1 h−1. The two compared catalysts of Rh–WxC/CNT and Rh–WxC/CS and other relevant samples were synthesized and evaluated under identical reaction conditions. Fig. S5 shows that the major products are alkanes and alcohols, with a minor amount of CO2, where the alkanes are mainly methane and C2–4 alkanes and most of the alcohols are methanol and ethanol. Blank test was performed first, and no syngas conversion activity was observed. CS was inactive for the conversion of syngas to HAs. CNTs exhibited approximately 100% selectivity to methane due to the residual metal species for preparing CNTs, such as Ni, an outstanding methanation catalyst. When WxC and CS were combined, a small quantity of hydrogenated products was detected, with the majority being methane (87.6%) and a minority being alcohols (8.6%) at a CO conversion of 1.8%. CO conversion (4.5%) and HA formation (15.4%) could be further enhanced, and methane (68.3%) was suppressed to some extent when CS was used instead of CNTs (Table S2). Interestingly, CO conversion over Rh–WxC/CNT was enhanced significantly from 3.3% for Rh–WxC/CS to 8.1%. The selectivity of ROH also improved to 43.5%. Simultaneously, the selectivity values of CH4 and C2-4 alkanes were considerably suppressed to 33.8% and 20.6%, respectively. The corresponding values were 27.9%, 40.6%, and 27.1% over Rh–WxC/CS (Fig. 7 a). A notable detail that alcohol distribution displayed obvious variations (Fig. 7b). The selectivity values of methanol and ethanol over Rh–WxC/CNT were 54.3% and 36.9% with S(C2+–OH)/S(MeOH) = 0.84. Moreover, the corresponding values over Rh–WxC/CS were 61.3% and 29.2% with S(C2+–OH)/S(MeOH) being 0.63 (Table S2). Therefore, Rh–WxC/CNT exhibited the high activity of HAs from syngas compared with Rh–WxC/CS. Rh/CNT without WxC addition was prepared and evaluated for HAs synthesis from syngas to further detect the promotion of WxC, and the activity of Rh/CNT at the same reaction conditions is shown in Table S2. The activity of Rh/CNT and Rh–WxC/CNT showed evident difference though selectivity of CO2 was relatively equivalent. Over Rh/CNT, the selectivity of ROH was 26.5%, while those of methane and C2-4 alkane were 43.8% and 23.6% at CO conversion of 6.6%, where the selectivity values of methanol and ethanol were 73.6% and 19.8% respectively, with C2+−OH/MeOH = 0.36. Therefore, the main product is still methanol. Compare with the pristine Rh/CNT, the incorporation of WxC apparently improved the formation of ROH, especially the synthesis of ethanol and C2+−OH. This finding indicated that the introduction of WxC to Rh/CNT system was conductive to the production of ROH and carbon-chain propagation. The enhanced SMSI was in favour of the higher dispersion of Rh species, which was beneficial to improve the formation of ROH and ethanol. The superior performance of the Rh–WxC/CNT catalyst for syngas transformation was further demonstrated by a comprehensive comparison with the published reports. As summarized in Table S3, the catalytic performance of Rh–WxC/CNT catalyst prepared by this work exhibited excellent activity under relative mild reaction conditions. The yield of ethanol and C2+–OH outperformed the representative compared catalysts."
8,Stability of catalysts,"3.3 Stability of catalysts The stability (Fig. 8 ) in syngas conversion to HAs was studied under the reaction conditions of T = 220 °C, P = 3.0 MPa, V(H2)/V(CO)/V(N2) = 60/30/10, and GHSV = 6000 mL g−1 h−1. CO conversion over Rh–WxC/CNT gradually decreased, while the selectivity of ROH progressively increased during the first 20 h. Therefore, a long induction period was required to balance the molar ratio of Rh+/Rh0 and the formation of WxC. The catalyst exhibited a steady state after the induction period. Rh–WxC/CNT displayed a longer lifetime of 100 h, with a selectivity of ROH of 43.5% at a CO conversion of 8.1%. By contrast, Rh–WxC/CS behaved completely differently. The CO conversion and selectivity of ROH sharply decreased from 34.8% to 24.6% and from 5.9% to 1.9%, respectively. This result indicated severe deactivation with time on stream. In addition, the activity of Rh–WxC/CNT was much higher than that of Rh–WxC/CS. Consequently, CNTs as carriers have a significant influence on the activity of the relative sample. Syngas conversion to HAs suffers from poor activity and severe deactivation due to coke formation and metal sintering [3]. In the present work, the main deactivation may come from metal sintering because of an abundant carbon source in the CNT/CS and WxC systems. Therefore, studying coke formation is very difficult [61]. Accordingly, the spent catalysts were characterized by TEM, XRD, and XPS in the present work to investigate the promotion of CNTs. Fig. S6 exhibits the TEM and SEM images of the spent catalysts of Rh–WxC/CNT and Rh–WxC/CS. As shown in Fig. S6a, no obvious aggregation of the NPs could be observed over Rh–WxC/CNT, implying better dispersion. As calculated based on the particle distribution in the inset in Fig. S6a, the particle size ranged from 1 nm to 8 nm, with an average particle size of 3.3 nm, exhibiting excellent dispersion. Therefore, CNTs favored high dispersion due to the anchoring effect, thus enhancing the interaction between CNTs and Rh–WxC. By contrast, for Rh–WxC/CS in Fig. S6b, sintering of the particles could be obviously observed, and the particles are larger than those of the fresh sample. This finding could be ascribed to the lack of an anchoring effect and the weak interaction between Rh–WxC and CS. Aggregation may be responsible for the low activity and deactivation of Rh–WxC/CS. This result is also in agreement with the sequence of the activity of the corresponding catalysts. The XRD patterns of Rh–WxC/CNT and Rh–WxC/CS before and after reaction are presented in Fig. 9 . No clear differences between Rh–WxC/CNT were found before and after the reaction, indicating that the phase composition and particle size did not obviously change. By contrast, substantial changes occurred in the fresh and spent Rh–WxC/CS. Compared with the fresh catalyst, the peak of the spent sample apparently became sharper, indicating that the particle size increased due to sintering. Moreover, the peaks of W2C were obviously enhanced, while the curves of WC significantly weakened, with the appearance of a new peak at 2θ = 40.3° due to metallic W. This finding indicated that the phase composition transformed from WC to W2C, even W, implying that carbon was lost. Therefore, carbon loss occurred on Rh–WxC/CS but not on Rh–WxC/CNT, indicating a strong anchoring effect of CNTs. This finding is in agreement with the results of the catalytic performance of the compared catalysts. XPS measurements were conducted to further study the electronic properties and the surface structure of the spent catalysts. The C 1s, Rh 3d, and W 4f in the spent catalysts of Rh–WxC/CNT and Rh–WxC/CS are shown in Fig. 10 . As shown in Fig. 10a, the C 1 s spectrum of the spent Rh–WxC/CNT showed no obvious changes compared with that of the fresh catalyst. It was mainly the characteristic peak of sp2-C in CNTs. Nonetheless, after the reaction, Rh–WxC/CS (Fig. 10b) showed a curve almost completely different from that of the fresh catalyst. Only the binding energy of graphitic carbon could be detected. The carbidic carbon peak almost disappeared simultaneously or overlapped with the graphitic carbon. This phenomenon indicated that carbon loss occurred. This finding agrees well with the XRD results. In the Rh 3d XPS profile (Fig. 10c and d) of the two compared systems, no distinct variations existed for the three main species of Rh0, Rh+, and Rh3+ on the surface of the samples. However, the proportion of Rh species was obviously different. After deconvolution, the molar ratio of Rh+/Rh0 (Table S1) in the spent Rh–WxC/CNT was 0.54, while the corresponding value was 0.21 over the spent Rh–WxC/CS, revealing that the addition of CNTs has an enormous influence on the proportion of Rh. A notable detail that the relevant numbers were 0.56 and 0.30 for the fresh samples of Rh–WxC/CNT and Rh–WxC/CS, respectively. This result indicated that CNTs play an important role in balancing Rh0 and Rh+ and maintaining stability, thus improving the activity and durability of the catalysts. The role of CNTs in improving the proportion of Rh+ and keeping the activity stable could perhaps be explained by a well-accepted hydrogen spillover onto CNTs [62,63]. As H2 preferentially adsorbs and spontaneously dissociates on the surface of the metal NPs, the active H atom immediately migrates onto the adjacent CNT [64]. Therefore, it could construct a surface microenvironment with sufficient CO and deficient H2, which favors inhibiting Rh oxide reduction. Furthermore, the high CO/H2 molar ratio is beneficial for the production of HAs due to the abundant CO associative active species, while a lack of H species to some extent may inhibit the formation of alkanes by preventing the hydrogenation of alkyl groups [8]. The W 4f XPS patterns of the spent samples are summarized in Fig. 10e and f. Compared with the patterns of the fresh samples, those of the spent samples exhibited two typical peaks centered at the high binding energy due to W–O. In Fig. 10e, W–C peaks were also observed, indicating the existence of WxC. Furthermore, two small W–O peaks coexisted in the pattern of Rh–WxC/CNT. However, the W–O peaks were significantly larger than the W–O peaks for spent Rh–WxC/CS, as shown in Fig. 10f. This phenomenon indicated abundant metallic W atoms on the surface of the spent Rh–WxC/CS, thus implying that the carbon loss was extremely serious. This finding agrees with the aforementioned characterizations."
9,Structure–performance relationship,"3.4 Structure–performance relationship According to the published literature and generally accepted knowledge, building an appropriate balance between carbon chain probability and CO insertion is necessary [65–67]. Extending to Rh-based catalysts, Rh0 facilitates CO dissociation, while CO association and insertion occur on the Rh+ active site to form C2–oxygenate intermediates, resulting in efficient production of HAs [68]. An effective strategy to improve the content of Rh+ could provoke the production of HAs and may further enhance the interaction between the metal and the immune support to the reducing atmosphere. TMCs are synthesized by incorporating carbon atoms into the interplanar sites of the pristine metal, exhibiting noble metal-like characters and affording the SMSIs. One effective method to further enhance the interaction between the metal and support is adding a new support with a large surface area and abundant anchoring sites. CNTs could be a good choice because of their advantageous large specific surface areas and functionalized structural surfaces to deduce abundant anchoring sites [47]. All of these factors enable CNTs to serve as an outstanding support or template, which is favorable for high catalytic performance and outperforms ordinary carriers. These ideas inspired the design of CNT and WxC copromoted systems, where both species could vigorously strengthen the interaction between the metal and support. As expected, the prepared Rh–WxC/CNT achieved highly dispersed active metal NPs and endowed a high proportion of Rh+. Meanwhile, the enhanced anchoring effect between the nanoparticles and support afforded Rh–WxC/CNT the ability to anti-sinter and relieve the loss of carbon, thereby providing high dispersion and inhibiting phase transformation and substantially improving the activity and stability for the conversion of syngas to HAs compared with Rh–WxC/CS, as illustrated in Scheme 2 . CS is a one-dimensional amorphous carbon that lacks the characterization of CNTs. Thus, it could not replace the promotion effect of CNTs. In general, Rh displays an important role in the synthesis of HAs from syngas. Rh0 is recognized as the active species for CO dissociation, while Rh+ adsorbs CO to facilitate the insertion to generate C2-intermediates. Increasing the content of Rh+ and maintaining the Rh+/Rh0 ratio at a proper value for the synthesis of HAs from syngas remain challenging. In this work, Rh–WxC nanocomposites were constructed on CNTs to increase the Rh+/Rh0 ratio and stabilize the Rh+ species during the reaction. The introduction of WxC facilitates the Rh species with altered electronic structure for favorable bonding with CO, which is beneficial for CO dissociation and insertion."
10,Conclusions,"Rh–WxC/CNT catalysts with highly dispersed Rh on hybrids of CNTs and WxC were synthesized via careful carburization of hybrid organic–inorganic precursors. The catalysts afforded better activity and stability in the synthesis of HAs from syngas than Rh–WxC/CS. Under the conditions of 220 °C, 3.0 MPa, H2/CO (2/1), and 6000 mL g–1 h−1 GHSV, Rh–WxC/CNT showed 8.1% CO conversion and 43.9% ROH (containing 36.9% EtOH), whereas Rh–WxC/CS exhibited 3.6% CO conversion and 27.9% ROH selectivity (containing 29.2% EtOH). Moreover, no substantial loss of catalytic performance was observed with Rh–WxC/CNT for at least 100 h on stream. The enhancement effects on Rh–WxC/CNT could be attributed to the strong interaction between CNTs and WxC and the anchoring effect of WxC on CNTs, which are both beneficial for the high dispersion of active Rh species and inhibition of carbon loss of WxC. These characteristics endow better enhancement for Rh–WxC/CNT in the conversion of syngas to HAs with a high proportion of Rh+ and WxC. The results showed that the metal–support interaction could be strengthened by the incorporation of CNTs, believably applicable for other TMCs. This work may pave the way for designing a highly dispersive and stable system of TMCs."
