0,Introduction,"Electrospinning technology is a processing technology that uses high-voltage static electricity to prepare polymer solutions or melts into microfibers or nanofibers [1]. Compared with the traditional spinning method, electrospinning nanofiber has more excellent properties, such as high specific surface area, large porosity, high thermal and electrical conductivity [2]. The electrospinning nanofiber has been extensively studied in tissue engineering, drug release, air or water filtration and separation, energy storage, and photocatalyst [3]. Recently, different kinds of metal oxide materials can be combined to form composite nanofiber by electrospinning technology for the application in photocatalyst [4,5]. However, there has no report on the hierarchical heterostructures of ZnO-In2S3 composite nanofiber for applying photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under blue LED irradiation to the best of our knowledge. Herein, we fabricated ZnO-In2S3 composite nanofiber and evaluated their blue LED-induced highly efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Combining ZnO nanopowder and In2S3 nanosheet into ZnO-In2S3 composite nanofiber can increase the light absorption ability and charge-carrier separation for greatly improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution."
1,Experimental,"In2S3 nanosheet was synthesized according to the previous literature [6]. ZnO nanopowder (Fig. 1 a) was purchased from Uniregion Bio-Tech. ZnO-In2S3 composite nanofiber fabricated via the facile electrospinning process. For electrospinning solution, 0.25 g poly(vinyl alcohol) and ZnO-In2S3 composites (mechanical mixing the different weights of In2S3 nanosheets and 0.025 g ZnO nanopowder) were added into 2.5 mL deionized water under the magnetic stirring for 2 h. The above precursor solutions were filled into a hypodermic syringe. The electrospinning parameters of the distance between the needle tip and collector, operating voltage, speed of the injector, and operating temperature were 14 cm, 14 kV, 0.3 mL h−1, and room temperature, respectively. The as-collected nanofiber dried at 70 °C for further use. The morphology, crystal structure, and photocatalytic performance of as-prepared samples have measured via field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800), X-ray powder diffraction (Bruker D2 phaser system), gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2014), UV–vis spectroscopy (Hitachi U-2900), and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy (RAMaker, Protrustech, He-Cd laser (λ = 325 nm))."
2,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 displays the FESEM images of commercial ZnO nanopowder, as-prepared In2S3 nanosheet, ZnO nanofiber, In2S3 nanofiber, and ZnO-In2S3 composite (ZnO:In2S3 = 1:0.75) nanofiber. The size of ZnO nanopowder (Fig. 1a) was about 15–120 nm. In2S3 nanosheet (Fig. 1b) with an average thickness of 10–20 nm was prepared by a hydrothermal method at the reaction temperature of 120 °C for 2 hr. The ZnO (Fig. 1c) and In2S3 (Fig. 1d) nanofiber were fabricated by the electrospinning method under the electrospinning solution with 0.025 g ZnO nanopowder and 0.025 g In2S3 nanosheet, respectively. The size of ZnO or In2S3 nanofiber was about 100–200 nm. The electrospinning can make ZnO nanopowder or In2S3 nanosheet decorated poly(vinyl alcohol) to avoid self-aggregation. The ZnO-In2S3 composite nanofiber (Fig. 1e) was fabricated by using the electrospinning method under the electrospinning solution with ZnO-In2S3 composite (ZnO:In2S3 = 1:0.75). The ZnO-In2S3 composite nanofiber exhibited similar morphology and size with ZnO or In2S3 nanofiber. The electrospinning can also use to avoid the self-aggregation of the ZnO-In2S3 composite. The crystal structures of ZnO nanopowder, In2S3 nanosheet, and ZnO-In2S3 composite (ZnO:In2S3 = 1:0.75) were shown in Fig. 2 . All diffraction peaks of ZnO nanopowder (Fig. 2a) and In2S3 nanosheet (Fig. 2b) can be indexed as the hexagonal phase of ZnO (JCPDS No. 89-0511) and tetragonal phase of In2S3 (JCPDS No. 73-1366), respectively. Compared with the strong diffraction peaks of ZnO in ZnO-In2S3 composite (Fig. 2c), only very weak characteristic peaks located at 29.5°, 32.6°, 33.2°, and 51.4° corresponded to (215), (1011), (0012), and (415) crystallographic planes of the tetragonal phase of In2S3 (JCPDS No. 73-1366), respectively. The XRD characterization results suggest that ZnO and In2S3 only construct the ZnO-In2S3 composite. Photocatalytic hydrogen production experiments were performed on the as-prepared photocatalysts in the presence of 50 mL aqueous solution with 0.1 M sodium sulfide (Na2S) under the blue LED (5 W, λmax = 420 nm) irradiation for 3 h. Fig. 3 a shows the photocatalytic hydrogen production on ZnO nanofiber, In2S3 nanofiber, and ZnO-In2S3 composite nanofiber with different weights of In2S3 nanosheet. The weights of the In2S3 nanosheet are 0.0125 (ZnO:In2S3 = 1:0.5), 0.01875 (ZnO:In2S3 = 1:0.75), and 0.025 g (ZnO:In2S3 = 1:1), respectively. The average hydrogen evolution rate is 31.1 (ZnO nanofiber), 1.3 (In2S3 nanofiber), 314.4 (ZnO:In2S3 = 1:0.5), 539.5 (ZnO:In2S3 = 1:0.75), and 292.4 μmol h−1 g−1 L−1 (ZnO:In2S3 = 1:1), respectively. An optimum average hydrogen evolution rate is obtained on ZnO-In2S3 composite (ZnO:In2S3 = 1:0.75) fiber, 17.3 and 415 times higher than ZnO and In2S3 nanofiber, respectively. Fig. 3b shows the photocatalytic hydrogen production on ZnO nanofiber and ZnO-In2S3 composite (ZnO:In2S3 = 1:0.75) nanofiber under white LED irradiation (5 W). The efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production using white light irradiation is worse than that of blue light. The possible reason is ascribed to the energy of white light dispersed in various wavelengths, but blue light reveals only a single band. The more concentrated blue light energy can increase the excitation amount of indium sulfide and improve the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency. This result proves that blue light has a better photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency than white light. Fig. 3c displays the average hydrogen evolution rate of ZnO-In2S3 composite (ZnO:In2S3 = 1:0.75) nanofiber with the four kinds of sacrificial reagents (such as Na2S, sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), methanol, and ethanol) under blue LED irradiation for 3 h. Na2S used as a sacrificial reagent can increase oxidation-reduction reaction and reduce photocorrosion in the metal sulfide materials to improve their photocatalytic hydrogen production [7,8]. Fig. 4 a displays the UV–vis absorption spectra of ZnO nanopowder, In2S3 nanosheet, and ZnO-In2S3 composite (ZnO:In2S3 = 1:0.75). The ZnO-In2S3 composite revealed a higher absorption from 300 to 800 nm than ZnO nanopowder. This result demonstrated that the mixture of In2S3 could significantly enhance the light absorption ability of ZnO. Fig. 4b displays the PL spectra of ZnO nanopowder, In2S3 nanosheet, and ZnO-In2S3 composite (ZnO:In2S3 = 1:0.75). For ZnO nanopowder, a strong UV emission (near-band-edge emission (NBE)) and a weak visible emission (deep-level emission (DLE)) are at about 388.3 nm (3.19 eV) and 550.4 nm (2.25 eV), respectively [9–11]. For the In2S3 nanosheet, a weak visible emission is at about 585.8 nm (2.12 eV), which ascribes to the electron-hole pair recombination of NBE of In2S3 [12,13]. The ZnO nanopowder revealed a stronger emission property than the ZnO-In2S3 composite. This result is ascribed to ZnO combining with In2S3, which can effectively reduce the recombination of photogenerated electron and hole pairs. The mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of ZnO-In2S3 composite is proposed in Fig. 4c. Under blue LED irradiation, the photoinduced electrons are transferred from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) of In2S3. The location of CB edge potential (−0.32 V) of ZnO is higher than In2S3 (−0.93 V), the photoinduced electrons in the CB of In2S3 shall be transferred into the CB of ZnO [11,14]. This phenomenon can enhance the separation of the photoinduced charge carrier to increase their photocatalytic activity under blue LED irradiation. In addition, the active species–trapping experiments (Fig. S1) of the ZnO-In2S3 composite (ZnO:In2S3 = 1:0.75) for photocatalytic hydrogen production under blue LED irradiation. In the present work, silver nitrate (AgNO3), isopropyl alcohol (IPA), triethanolamine (TEOA), and L-ascorbic acid (AA) were used as radical scavengers to quench electrons (e−), hydroxyl radicals (OH), holes (h+), and superoxide radical anions (O2 –), respectively [15–17]. It can be seen that introducing AgNO3 scavenger in the photocatalytic reaction leads to markedly declining photocatalytic efficiency. This result demonstrates that electrons act as the essential primary radicals in photocatalytic hydrogen production."
3,Conclusions,"A facile electrospinning method was employed to fabricate ZnO-In2S3 composite nanofiber, which can be used as a highly efficient blue LED-induced photocatalyst in hydrogen production. This result is attributed to an increase in the light absorption ability and charge carrier separation on the ZnO-In2S3 composite nanofiber."
