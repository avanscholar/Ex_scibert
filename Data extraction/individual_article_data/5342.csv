0,Introduction,"Sweetness and aroma are two of the most important factors for fruit quality and consumer preference (Shalit et al., 2001), with volatile substances contributing to the flavor of fruit. Melon varieties (Cucumis melo L.) differ in physical and chemical attributes. They produce volatile aldehydes, alcohols and especially large quantities of esters, which are likely to be key contributors to their unique aroma (Bauchot et al., 1998). The volatile esters containing a branched alkyl chain originate from valine, isoleucine and leucine (Wyllie et al., 1995). The aliphatic esters can also be produced from free fatty acids such as linoleic and linolenic acids via generation of short-chain compounds through β-oxidation (Sanz et al., 1997; Baldwin et al., 2000). Both pathways converge in the formation of aldehydes, which are subsequently reduced to alcohols in a reaction catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase (Speirs et al., 1998). Alcohol dehydrogenases catalyze the reversible conversion of aldehydes to the corresponding alcohols (Manriquez et al., 2006). These alcohols are then utilized for the production of esters in reactions catalyzed by alcohol acetyltransferases (AATs) (Fellman et al., 2000). AATs represent a large group of enzymes, which include the AAT responsible for acetylation of alcohols (Ueda et al., 1997). Melon genotypes of reticulate, momordica, agrestis and cv. Prince melon contain specific AAT for converting isobutyl alcohol into isobutyl acetate (Ueda et al., 1997). Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus Matsumu.), on the other hand, lacks the AAT for producing isobutyl alcohol esters (Ueda et al., 1997). Esterification of added alcohols by fruit discs was investigated by Myers et al. (1970). Further studies focused on aldehyde reduction to alcohol and subsequent ester formation in various fruit tissues (Ueda and Ogata, 1978). Studies have also been conducted for conversion of alcohols to their corresponding acetate, propionate, butyrate, 3-methylbutyrate (isovalerate) and hexanoate (caproate) esters by incubating alcohols with strawberry fruit disks for 1h at 30°C (Yamashita et al., 1975). Alcohol acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.84), a key enzyme in aroma biosynthesis, catalyzes the reaction between acyl CoA and alcohol, resulting in the formation of esters (Fig. 1A). These enzymes are capable of combining different alcohols and acyl CoAs resulting in the synthesis of a wide range of esters accounting for the diversity of esters emitted by the fruit (El-Sharkawy et al., 2005). Alcohol moieties of esters reflect the alcohols predominantly synthesized in fruit while acid moieties of esters reflect the acyl CoA specificity of the AAT (Ueda et al., 1992). Strawberry AAT has high activity with hexanol and acetyl or butyl CoA as respective substances, while banana AAT has high activity with butanol and acetyl CoA but shows less activity with butyl CoA (Olias et al., 1995). Thus, AATs derived from different fruit possess different substrate specificities for alcohol and acyl CoA. AAT activity has been detected in melon (Ueda et al., 1997; Ueda and Ogata, 1978; Shalit et al., 2000; Lucchetta et al., 2007), apple (Fellman and Mattheis, 1995), banana (Harada et al., 1985) and strawberry (Olias et al., 2002; Perez et al., 1993). Melon AAT has the capability to synthesize sulfur-containing esters (thioether esters) (Lucchetta et al., 2007). Recently, another type of AAT enzyme named benzyl alcohol acetyltransferase (BEAT) has been found in a native Californian flower (Clarkia breweri), which is responsible for esterification of benzyl alcohols in the flower. BEAT has a high affinity for aromatic alcohols such as benzyl alcohol and cinnamyl alcohol (Dudareva et al., 1998). Benzyl acetate is one of the most important aromas of the flower and fragrance industries. It is the main component of jasmine and gardenia essential oils and is being used in many other oils as a minor component (Aharoni et al., 2000). In our previous study, we found that the melon AAT and BEAT activities were aligned in the same position in an active staining gel after electrophoresis of the desalted crude enzyme preparation from melon. Based on this finding, we speculated that both enzyme activities might originate from a single protein (Khanom et al., 2003a). In this study, we show the ester-forming ability of AAT and BEAT in two melon cultivars using various aliphatic and aromatic substrates. In order to elucidate the critical steps at which the production of aroma volatiles could be regulated in melon, the capability of fruit pulp to convert precursors of the aliphatic and aromatic esters/acetate pathway was evaluated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Plant materials,2.1 Plant materials Melon (C. melo L. cv. Prince and cv. Earl's favorite) fruit were used for this experiment. They were purchased from the local market. Maturity was 25d after anthesis. Three melons were used for each experiment.
3,Aliphatic ester analysis,"2.2 Aliphatic ester analysis Ten grams of melon pulp slices and 10μL alcohol were incubated at 30°C for different times in a 50-mL Erlenmeyer sealed flask. Then 2mL of headspace gas was taken through the rubber cap of the flask and injected into a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). GC was (Shimazu 8A, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with FID. Column was PEG 6000 (1m×3mm). Injector and detector temperatures were 180°C and column temperature was 90°C. Carrier gas was nitrogen 30mL/min. Air was 1mL/min and hydrogen was 440mL/min. For a blank, 10g pulp was incubated at 30°C for different times in 50-mL sealed Erlenmeyer flask. Gases formed in the headspace were collected and analyzed by gas chromatography as described above. The gas chromatographic conditions were the same as above except for the detection temperature, which was 50°C. Three replicates were used for both control and experimental samples."
4,Aromatic ester analysis,"2.3 Aromatic ester analysis Ten grams of melon pulp and 10μL alcohol or aldehyde and 10mL hexane were incubated at 30°C in a sealed Erlenmeyer flask for various times. After incubation, 10mL of the hexane layer were concentrated to 400μL by drying. Then 1μL of the concentrated mixture was analyzed by GC. The gas chromatographic conditions were the same as the conditions used for aliphatic esters, except for the temperatures for injector/detector and column that were, respectively, 250 and 150°C."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Bioconversion of aliphatic alcohol to ester,"3.1 Bioconversion of aliphatic alcohol to ester When pulp slices of cv. Prince and cv. Earl's favorite melon fruit were incubated in the flask in the absence of any precursor, only ethanol and ethyl acetate were produced (Figs. 2A and 3A ). In cv. Prince melon, maximum production of ethanol and ethyl acetate was observed after 8h of incubation. Ethanol production decreased over 12h of incubation and no ethanol was detected in 16–24h. The ethyl acetate level, however, was sustained over the incubation period of 24h (Fig. 2A). At 8h of incubation, the production of ethyl acetate was about threefold higher than the production of ethanol. On the other hand, production of ethanol and ethyl acetate in cv. Earl's favorite melon pulps linearly increased during the incubation period of 12h (Fig. 3A). At 24h of incubation, ethanol production was about 2.5 times higher than the ethyl acetate production. The endogenous production of ethanol in both melons was almost same. Incubation of ethanol, isobutanol, isoamyl alcohol, hexanol and 2-hexenol with cv. Prince melon discs resulted in the production of their corresponding acetate esters as shown in Fig. 2B–F. Isobutyl acetate and hexyl acetate production was highest and lowest among all acetate production, respectively. This could probably be due to the low and high kms of the enzyme for substrate alcohols and acetyl CoA, respectively. Conversion of ethanol into its corresponding ester showed a linear kinetics during the initial 8 and 12h of incubation (Fig. 2B). Acetate production increased abruptly, but the progression of isobutyl acetate production was slow (Fig. 2C). For the rest of the alcohols, the conversion into their acetates followed hyperbolic kinetics (Fig. 2D–F). Acetate production from different alcohols was higher in cv. Prince melon than in cv. Earl's melon. Ethyl acetate production in cv. Earl's melon was about 13% that in cv. Prince melon. Isobutyl acetate production was about twice in cv. Prince melon that in Earl's melon after 24h of incubation. At this time, levels of isoamyl and hexyl acetates production were, respectively, about 1.6 and 2 times higher in cv. Prince melon than in cv. Earl's melon. 2-Hexenyl acetate production was also observed in cv. Prince melon. In both melons the production of esters followed the order: isobutyl>isoamyl>ethyl alcohol. These results suggest that both melons possess AAT-like activities for converting different alcohols into corresponding acetates. In our previous study, we have shown that ethyl acetate is a major ester during maturation and storage of cv. Prince melon (Khanom et al., 2003b). Similar observations were made in this study. The higher isobutyl acetate production among all aliphatic acetates tested here suggests higher AAT-like activities for isobutyl alcohol conversion into its acetate."
7,Bioconversion of aromatic alcohol to ester formation,"3.2 Bioconversion of aromatic alcohol to ester formation Conversion capability of cv. Prince and Earl's melons for generating aromatic acetate and aldehyde from aromatic alcohols was also tested (Fig. 4A and B). When melon discs were incubated for different periods up to 48h with benzyl alcohol, conversion of benzyl alcohol into benzyl acetate took place. The production of acetate increased with time for cv. Prince melon, but the production in Earl's melon increased for up to 24h and then the production declined at 48h of incubation. Similar kinetics were observed for benzaldehyde conversion. During incubation for 24 and 48h, acetate and benzaldehyde production in cv. Prince melon were, respectively, about 8 and 1.8 times higher than in Earl's melon. Alcohol levels gradually decreased and maintained a constant level in cv. Prince melon. In Earl's melon it decreased to almost zero in 2h. The added alcohol may have been used for production of compounds other than acetate and aldehydes. The conversion kinetics for production of 2-phenyl ethyl acetate followed a hyperbolic curve in both melons (Fig. 4C and D). The level of conversion in both melons was almost the same. At 48h incubation, 2 times higher conversion was observed in cv. Prince melon compared to cv. Earl's melon. Conversion of 3-phenyl-1-propanol into its acetate in cv. Prince melon was much higher than in cv. Earl's melon (Fig. 4E and F). Conversion of aromatic benzaldehyde into its acetate was also tested in both melons (Fig. 5A and B). When incubated with melon discs, benzaldehyde was converted to benzyl acetate and the conversion increased with time, except for Earl's melon in which the highest increase observed was at 24h and then declined in the 48-h incubation period. In this conversion reaction, benzyl acetate production was about 1.5 times higher in cv. Prince melon compared to cv. Earl's melon. Levels of aldehyde gradually decreased in both melons. These results suggest that the enzymatic activities for conversion of aromatic alcohols and benzaldehyde into acetate are higher in cv. Prince melon than in cv. Earl's melon. When pulp slices were fed with aromatic alcohols, there was a rapid decline in the concentration of aromatic alcohols with an increase in acetate in the hexane layer (Fig. 4). These results suggest that aromatic esters were enzymatically produced and accumulated in the hexane layer in the absence of added acetyl donors. No aromatic esters were found in the absence of aromatic alcohol. The ester formation in cv. Prince melon fruit was observed in the following order: benzyl alcohol>2-phenylethanol>3-phenyl-1-propanol and in cv. Earl's favorite: 2-phenylethanol>benzyl alcohol>3-phenyl-1-propanol. Benzyl acetate, which is made from benzyl alcohol and acetyl CoA, is a major component in C. breweri scent, and is synthesized by a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme BEAT (Dudareva et al., 1998). Like C. breweri, benzyl alcohol was the major alcohol in both melon fruit. From these findings, we can assume that benzyl alcohol is the most favoured substrate for BEAT in cv. Prince melon and in cv. Earl's favorite melon. The BEAT activity was reported to be involved in the production of the floral scent of C. breweri and primarily accepts benzyl alcohol as a substrate, whereas 2-phenyl ethanol and other alcohols are accepted but at lower rates (Dudareva et al., 1998). This is consistent with the present study in melon fruit. Shalit et al. (2001) also reported the same findings for BEAT enzyme, which preferred benzyl alcohol in developmental stages of cv. Arava and cv. Rochet melon. The present study was done with ripening fruit, and to date has not been reported in melon. Here we used a new substrate 3-phenyl-1-propanol, which was found to be acylated by both melon cultivar pulps to produce the respective esters. It is possible that cv. Prince and cv. Earl's favorite melon, which are climacteric type melons, have an AAT activity with broad substrate specificity. It also can be assumed that in melons, more than one isoform of AAT exists, and this needs to be further investigated. When pulp slices were fed with benzaldehyde, production of benzyl acetate varied with variety, as shown in Fig. 5. In cv. Prince melon fruit, the production of acetate ester was higher than in cv. Earl's favorite melon fruit. It can be explained by suggesting that after addition, benzaldehyde was reduced to benzyl alcohol by alcohol dehydrogenase and subsequently AAT acetylate benzyl alcohol produced benzyl acetate via acetyl CoA. In previous work, on treatment with aldehydes, the contents of all esters derived from the corresponding alcohols increased strongly in apple (De Pooter et al., 1983). However, in this study, ester formation ability was not so strong (Fig. 5), which indicates that aldehyde may not be a good substrate for melon AAT. The above results show that both cv. Prince and cv. Earl's favorite melons are able to acetylate several alcohols, including aliphatic and aromatic alcohols as substrates to their corresponding esters by AAT. Our data are in agreement with previous work showing that incubation of apple fruit discs with aliphatic and aromatic alcohols resulted in the production of ester volatiles (Souleyre et al., 2005). Similar observations were made by applying vapors of the precursors directly onto intact apples (De Pooter et al., 1983) and strawberries (Yamashita et al., 1977) and fruit discs of Charentais cantaloupe melon (Flores et al., 2002). Aromatic volatile esters were found in the headspace of different melon varieties such as cv. Arava (Aharoni et al., 2000), cantaloupe melon (Lamikanra et al., 2002), cv. Athena (Jordan et al., 2001), cv. Sol Real (Beaulieu and Grime, 2001). Application of aldehydes and carboxylic acids to intact climacteric apples results in an increased volatile production and, in the case of precursors with an uneven carbon chain, in a changed headspace pattern (De Pooter et al., 1983). The incubation of pentanal with a strawberry fruit causes the conversion of pentanal to 1-pentanol at every stage of maturity. However, an immature fruit at 5d after blooming converted the added pentanal to 1-pentanol but no ester formation was observed (Paillard, 1979). At the ripening stage, the presence of aromatic alcohol and acetate ester in muskmelon (C. melo L. cv. Athena) fruit was reported but no bioconversion was found by pulp (Jordan et al., 2001). Bioconversion of hexanol and hexanal to their corresponding esters was observed in Charentais melon (Flores et al., 2002) which is similar to our study. Recently, in Charentais cantaloupe melon, Yahyaoui et al. (2002) reported that one recombinant protein of AAT gene (CM-AAT1) showed activity to esterify both aliphatic and aromatic alcohols but was unable to esterify ethanol. There are discrepancies between AAT from melon and recombinant protein in some part of substrate specificity, for example, ethanol. El-Sharkawy et al. (2005) cloned three genes encoding alcohol acyltransferases in Charentais melon fruit during ripening and made recombinant proteins. Each of them showed different substrate specificities. They also reported that these three proteins did not produce some esters present in the melon. This indicates that probably melon has several AAT proteins. In conclusion, esterification of aliphatic and aromatic alcohols with the acetyl CoA occurred efficiently in the melon pulp slices. Our data demonstrated that melon pulp could maintain AAT/BEAT activity up to 24 or 48h and AAT has broad substrate specificity for both aliphatic and aromatic alcohols."
