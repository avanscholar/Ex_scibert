0,Introduction,"The combustion of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) to generate energy results in huge amounts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere, typically in CO2 form [1–4]. In 2018, approximately 33 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions [5], resulted in a considerable increase in the atmospheric CO2 concentration from 280 ppm to 410 ppm. Production of sustainable and clean energy as a necessity for future consumption requires energy-efficient and advanced technologies [6–8]. In addition, increasing the use of renewable energy and valorization of different raw materials are necessary. In this regard, carbon capture and storage (CCS) as well as carbon capture and utilization (CCU) are hypothesized to play important roles [9–15]. These technologies offer significant benefits for reducing carbon emissions, with the latter promoting a circular economy, through encouraging industrial symbiosis from industry with large CO2 footprints, and providing renewable energy storage. This is consistent with the European policy with the goal of reducing 40 % of GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels [16,17]. Indeed, CO2 storage and use to produce various chemicals play a significant role in achieving this objective. CCS plays an important role in the reduction of GHG emissions along with climate change mitigation in the future. CCU is another attractive approach; but, compared to total CO2 production the market for the utilization of recovered CO2 is rather small (11%–17%) [18]. However, CCU results in the production of valuable fuels and chemicals in addition to the reduction of CO2 emissions compared to CCS [19]. CCUS is the integration of CCU and CCS that may be able to effectively exploit the benefits of the corresponding approaches, via increasing both economic and environmental incentives [20]. In this regard, CO2 is a key component to decrease fossil consumption via transforming to valuable chemicals while ensuring the energy efficiency of a process. Moreover, CO2 conversion to feedstocks for the chemical/petrochemical industry can be an efficient method for the renewable energy contribution in the chemical chain [21–27]. Many studies have been devoted to the utilization of CO2 as an available waste resource in terms of a cheap raw material [28–32]. CO2 can be supplied via the integration with various chemical plants. For instance, emissions of ammonia plants can be recovered for the simultaneous production of methanol and ammonia. The cement industry as well as iron and steel plants are other CO2 sources [33]. In addition, much attention should be paid to industrial and municipal wastes as potential CO2 sources [34,35]. Therefore, studying and disseminating knowledge about fuels and chemical production via capturing CO2 from other processes is of paramount significance. However, social acceptance is very low about this issue and some skepticism regarding long term ecological advantages exist [36]. Centi et al. [21] and Olah et al. [37] proposed three different pathways for CO2 utilization to produce various compounds comprising methanol and dimethyl ether (DME). As shown in Scheme 1 , the main products of CO2 activation and transformation are methane, methanol, DME and hydrocarbons (olefins/ LPG/ gasoline/aromatic) [38]. Using excess renewable energy from wind and solar, the “Power-to-Fuel” strategy has attracted much attention and CO2 hydrogenation forms a core of this technology when coupled with CO2 capture and renewable H2 production from electrolysis. Accordingly, CO2 hydrogenation is extensively investigated in scientific literature for providing a direct pathway to produce various chemicals as fuels or feeds in other processes [39–45]. Catalytic hydrogenation is the most mature and promising technology in this regard [46]. Different catalysts catalyze CO2 hydrogenation to various products as depicted in Scheme 2 [47]."
1,The main products of CO2 conversion,"1.1 The main products of CO2 conversion CO2 hydrogenation when the H2/CO2 ratio is equal to 4 [48,49], results in CH4 formation through the Sabatier reaction (R1) [21]. The Sabatier reaction is well known, but its application as an appropriate route for CO2 utilization is hindered due to the large H2 consumption, lower energy per unit volume and difficulties in storage compared with oxygenates (methanol, DME). (R1) C O 2 + 4 H 2 → C H 4 + 2 H 2 O Δ H 298 K = − 164.63 k J / m o l Methanol is one of the main raw materials in chemical/petrochemical industries owing to its extensive applications as solvent, energy source (e.g., as fuel, or in mixture with gasoline) and chemical feedstocks (e.g., for the production of methyl methacrylate, dimethyl carbonate, chloromethane, acetic acid, formaldehyde, methylamines, dimethyl terephthalate, and methyl tertiary butyl ether, etc.) [50–52]. In addition, methanol can be used for the production of ethylene and propylene via methanol-to-olefin (MTO) processes [53,54]. In recent years, methanol production from CO2 has gained much attention owing to the proposition of the so-called “Power-to-Fuel” concept [48,49], which is driven by availability of cost effective renewable energy. Direct methanol production through CO2 hydrogenation is represented in (R2) [55]: (R2) C O 2 + 3 H 2 ↔ C H 3 O H + H 2 O Δ H 298 K = − 49.5 k J / m o l However, the traditional route for methanol production is the gas to methanol process, where CO is obtained from CO2 via the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction and transformed to methanol as presented in (R3) and (R4) [56,57]: (R3) C O 2 + H 2 ↔ C O + H 2 O Δ H 298 K = + 41.2 k J / m o l (R4) C O + 2 H 2 ↔ C H 3 O H Δ H 298 K = − 90.7 k J / m o l Many efforts to synthesize effective catalysts along with designing advanced reactors for CO2 hydrogenation have made it a competitive technology with industrial methanol synthesis from syngas. The required H2/CO2 ratio for methanol production should be 3 [58]. Considering energy and safety aspects, using H2 to produce methanol from CO2, i.e., for a direct methanol fuel cell, is more appropriate compared to reversible H2 storage as formic acid for use in PEM fuel cells. In addition, methanol-based fuel cells were found to comprise the greatest portion of the methanol market [21,59]. Methanol can also be converted to DME, a colorless environmentally friendly ether, which is not corrosive or toxic, and can be employed as a clean fuel and chemical building block for the production of valuable materials such as light olefins (ethylene and propylene) [60]. In addition, chlorofluorocarbon species in aerosols can be replaced by DME [61]. Moreover, DME can be used to produce alkyl aromatics as a hydrogen source in fuel cells. Besides, DME acts as an important intermediate for methyl acetate and dimethyl sulfate production [62]. DME can be produced via catalytic methanol dehydration (R5) based on either Langmuir-Hinshelwood [63] or Eley-Rideal [64] mechanisms, wherein both DME and water are reported to act as inhibitors during reaction [65]. (R5) 2 C H 3 O H ↔ C H 3 O C H 3 + H 2 O Δ H 298 K = − 23.4 k J / m o l Ethanol production from carbon dioxide has received less attention [66,67], despite the interest in recent decades in employing ethanol as both fuel [68] and feedstock for the production of numerous chemicals [69]. Ethanol can also increase the octane number of petrol and decrease CO and particulate matter emissions. Direct ethanol synthesis proceeds according to (R6) [48,49] and has low selectivity toward C2+ alcohols and low conversions even at high pressures. (R6) 2 C + 1 2 O 2 + 3 H 2 → C 2 H 5 O H Δ H 298 K = − 277.7 k J / m o l The reaction is believed to proceed through two steps comprising RWGS (R3) and CO hydrogenation (R7) [66]: (R7) 2 C O + 4 H 2 ↔ C 2 H 5 O H + H 2 O Δ H 298 K = − 255.6 k J / m o l CO2 conversion to CO occurs at high temperatures (a CO2 conversion of about 48% can be obtained at 575 °C) owing to the endothermicity of the RWGS reaction. Another pathway for ethanol production is through DME transformation as reported by Atsonios et al. [48,49]. At first, carbon dioxide and hydrogen react to form methanol according to (R2–R4) and then methanol is dehydrated to DME via (R5). DME is then transformed into methyl acetate as an intermediate in (R8), which is then hydrogenated to ethanol as represented in (R9): (R8) C H 3 O C H 3 + C O ↔ C H 3 C O O C H 3 Δ H 298 K = − 114.16 k J / m o l (R9) C H 3 C O O C H 3 + 2 H 2 ↔ C H 3 O H + C 2 H 5 O H Δ H 298 K = − 30.3 k J / m o l CO2 can be hydrogenated to hydrocarbons through both direct and indirect pathways, e.g. by producing synthesis gas and/or methanol as an intermediate. [70–73]. The indirect path can be accomplished in a single-stage reactor using hybrid catalysts or in multi-stage reactors to conduct multi-step transformations simultaneously (R3) along with (R10 to R11) [74]. (R10) n C O + 2 n H 2 ↔ C n H 2 n + n H 2 O A l k e n e p r o d u c t i o n (R11) n C O + ( 2 n + 1 ) H 2 ↔ C n H 2 n + 2 + n H 2 O A l k a n e p r o d u c t i o n (R12) n C O 2 + 3 n H 2 ↔ ( C H 2 ) n + n H 2 O D i r e c t C O 2 h y d r o g e n a t i o n The direct transformation (R12) occurs analogous to the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reaction where CO2 and H2 are considered as feed. Generally, hydrocarbon production from CO2 requires more energy and H2 consumption and comprise more reaction steps with respect to the production of oxygenates and is not considered as a favorable method of fuel production [75]. Nevertheless, other reasons such as better infrastructure integration and growth in the market may justify this path. Thus, an integrated life-cycle and techno-economic analysis are essential to analyze different possibilities. In fact, direct hydrocarbon production using CO2 hydrogenation, which includes RWGS and FT reactions is one of the most significant applications of CCU (Scheme 1) [38]."
2,Hydrogen sources,"1.2 Hydrogen sources In this context, hydrogen is required for the activation and transformation of CO2 to value-added fuels and chemicals. H2 has the ability to activate CO2, owing to exhibiting high energy density, which is a thermodynamically stable molecule [76,77]. Steam methane reforming, syngas, coke oven gas and chlorine alkali plants can be used as hydrogen sources in hydrogenation reactions [78]. Various hydrogen sources are presented in Scheme 3 . However, future investigations should be devoted to finding alternative sources of H2 to guarantee process economics (approximately 65% of costs are ascribed to the electrolyzer) [79–82]. In addition, hydrogen production technologies should have a zero carbon footprint to meet GHG mitigation targets. Today, the most common method of H2 production is steam methane reforming, which results in CO formation along with hydrogen (R13). Further reaction of CO with H2O can lead to hydrogen generation according to (R14). (R13) C H 4 + H 2 O → 3 H 2 + C O Δ H 298 K = + 205.8 k J / m o l (R14) H 2 O + C O → H 2 + C O 2 Δ H 298 K = − 41.2 k J / m o l These emissions can be minimized via autothermal reforming where oxygen is used along with H2O (R15) in the reactor at high temperatures (> 727 °C). However, further optimization concerning the H2/CO ratio, catalyst activity and its deactivation are required to achieve eco-friendly process standards. (R15) C x H y O z + O 2 + H 2 O → H 2 + C O + C O 2 + C n H m + t a r Another route for hydrogen generation is the utilization of biomass in gasification, pyrolysis and liquefaction processes [84–86]. Biomass gasification is more beneficial with respect to conventional coal gasification since biomass is naturally renewable. Combining biomass and coal gasification can minimize CO2 production and subsequently reduces negative environmental consequences [87]. Ethanol, glycerol, bio-liquids and bio-oils can be used as biomass sources. However, problems regarding feed quality, seasonal availability and regional dependencies should be solved as well as economic issues. Consequently, improved technologies with reduced catalyst deactivation as well as fewer carbon emissions require development. One of the promising H2 generation methods, to produce high purity hydrogen without further separation costs, is water electrolysis (R16). Industrial electrolysis plants can produce hydrogen with about 50-70 % efficiency. However, the main issue of this process is to achieve electricity production with low cost and low carbon emission. Therefore, fossil fuels should be substituted by renewable energies such as solar or wind in electricity generation plants to mitigate the CO2 formation [88–90]. The mentioned energies are climate dependent, which should be considered in designing sustainable operation. (R16) 2 H 2 O → 2 H 2 + O 2 Δ H S T P = + 237 k J / m o l Solar energy can also be used for H2O splitting to H2 and O2 in the presence of catalysts exhibiting special electronic structures (photo-semiconductor) or some microorganisms [91]. However, this process is still far from commercial implementation due to low efficiency, low durability and high oxidation-resistant catalysts. As a whole, due to no CO2 byproduct, water electrolysis seems to be the most appropriate source of H2 production if CO2-free sources can be used for the required electricity generation [92]."
3,Scope of current review,"1.3 Scope of current review A recent review by Jiang et al. [93] addresses CO2 hydrogenation to methanol in terms of catalyst design, mechanistic and kinetic studies as well as reactor design and optimization. In addition, Zhong et al. [94] studied the thermodynamic challenges and catalyst development of this process along with industrial reactor development, while Nie et al. [95] focused on recent advances in catalytic materials and mechanistic insight for the production of alcohols and hydrocarbons. However, the significance of choosing the appropriate reactor configuration along with mechanistic considerations have not been addressed for the mentioned processes. Accordingly, kinetic modeling of CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons was investigated [96] and the kinetic parameters of the simultaneous RWGS and FT reactions were evaluated through an artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm considering mass and heat transport in a fixed-bed catalytic reactor [97]. This study systematically investigates three different processes, namely methane, methanol and hydrocarbon synthesis via hydrogenation of CO2. The effects of catalyst and mechanism, operating conditions as well as reactor type on CO2 hydrogenation are investigated. Additionally, a comprehensive outline about reactor configurations as the most significant parameter on process enhancement is provided. Moreover, by taking account of the current literature, the differenct configurations of the reactor based on the reaction mechanisms are discussed. Lastly, a corrugated-wall dual-type membrane reactor is proposed as a promising alternative for CO2 hydrogenation to value-added products."
4,Methanation,"CO2 hydrogenation to methane (Sabatier reaction) is an exothermic reaction, which has been developed in 1902 [98–100]. This reaction is significant for closed loop CO2 cycling where CO2 from contained spaces are recycled to fuel for combustion. Literature reported effects of catalyst development and mechanistic studies, operating conditions and reactor configuration are presented in the following sections."
5,Development of catalysts and mechanism in methanation,"2.1 Development of catalysts and mechanism in methanation Many attempts have been devoted to finding efficient catalysts for the CO2 methanation [101–111]. Noble metals such as Rh, Ru, Pd and Pt supported on various oxides have been reported as very active methanation catalysts even at low temperatures and low metal loading. [112–119]. Ru and Rh are the most active catalysts in CO2 methanation, exhibiting higher turnover numbers (about 20 times) than other noble metals when supported on alumina. As a dopant, Ru could facilitate the reduction of CeO2 at lower temperatures rather than undoped Ce-oxide and provided about 50% CO2 conversion. In addition, Ru and Rh-based oxides have been reported for their high methane selectivity (about 99%) compared to that of Pt or Pd, which were more selective towards CO [120]. Moreover, noble metals have been found to be more resistant to deactivation over a wide temperature range, due to less carbon deposits. However, limited availability and high cost of noble metals have hampered their application for CO2 methanation [99,120]. Among non-noble metals, Co, Fe and Ni have been proposed for CO2 methanation [121], since they showed good performance in the FT reaction. However, using CO2 instead of CO led to higher hydrogenation performance, which was attributed to the weaker CO2-Co adsorption compared to that of CO-Co resulting in the formation of CH4 rather than long-chain hydrocarbons [122]. Moreover, Co was reported to be more expensive than Ni, which has hindered its utilization for industrial scale methane production [104]. Generally, pure Fe has not shown comparable CO2 methanation performance, but in combination with other metals such as Co and Ni could enhance the process yield by enhancing CH4 selectivity. The formation of Fe-Co alloys in Fe-Co/alumina increased methane selectivity via reducing the formation of aluminate compared to Co/alumina [123]. Ni-based catalysts on various supports have also been extensively investigated for CO2 methanation as a result of their great performance and low cost [124–133]. Ni is known as the most selective catalyst among methanation catalysts, and exhibits a relatively high activity compared to other metals, resulting in its utilization for industrial applications [104]. However, the performance of the metal is strongly dependent on the metal-support interface interaction and properties [120,134–136]. CeO2 is the best support for Ni compared to Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ), TiO2, Al2O3 and MgO exhibiting 100% selectivity to methane. Ceria proved to be able to supply large amounts of oxygen due to its facile oxygen exchange characteristics, and increased the CO2 hydrogenation activity [137–140]. In addition, ZrO2-CeO2 supports showed 99% selectivity to CH4 at CO2 conversion of 95% [141,142]. Generally, methanation mechanisms have been categorized into two groups: associative and dissociative schemes as depicted in Fig. 1 [99]. In the first pathway, associative adsorption of CO2 and its reaction with adsorbed hydrogen led to the formation of oxygenates, which can be hydrogenated in several steps to form methane. However, in the dissociative route carbonyl and atomic oxygen formed via CO2 adsorption and further carbonyl hydrogenation led to methane formation [98,99,120]. Formate species and CO are the main intermediates for the associative and dissociative pathways, respectively [120]. It has been indicated that synchrotron-based methods are the best facilities to analyze the catalyst behavior while studying the local coordination of active species under practical conditions [143,144]. Identifying the adsorbed species, probing chemical information from the ligands along with calculating bond distances are possible via employing element specific X-ray photon-in/photon-out techniques like high-energy resolution fluorescence detected X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (HERFD-XANES) and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) [145]. Vogt et al. [146] proposed three paths for the Sabatier reaction over Ni-nano catalysts such as carbide, formate and carboxyl. They concluded the carbide route is the most active route over Ni/SiO2 catalysts, while the formate path, which has been demonstrated via operando spectroscopic techniques (especially FTIR) is not active for Ni/SiO2. The carboxyl route is another path which has not been considered in the literature. None of the intermediates or products of the carboxyl path (for instance, CH3OH) have been addressed in the literature, indicating its inactivity over Ni/SiO2 catalysts. Interaction between main routes (carbide and formate) through H-assisted CO dissociation is sensible for methane formation via CO2 hydrogenation, since direct CO dissociation has rather high energy barrier. It is noteworthy to mention that reducibility of catalyst supports can play a significant role in electron delocalization around the adsorbed CO2 or CO. In fact, the mentioned step can be efficiently enhanced, which results in higher activity. Jia et al. [147] proposed that Ni/ZrO2 could catalyze CO2 methanation via two pathways based on the catalyst preparation method. In this respect, CO2 hydrogenation proceeds via dissociative or CO-intermediated routes over Ni/ZrO2-P, while a formate-mediated pathway occurred over Ni/ZrO2-C as depicted in Fig. 2. However, Ashok et al. [148] showed that methanation occurred through the formate pathway over Ni/CZ (CeO2-ZrO2). Ni could dissociate H2 and spillover the resultant hydrogen atoms to the Ce species. CO2 could adsorb on the catalyst surface in the form of mono- and bi-dentate carbonates, which then were hydrogenated to formate. These formate species then transform into formaldehyde, methoxy species and finally methane as can be observed in Fig. 3. However, Pan et al. [149,150] reported that the contributions of monodentate and hydrogen carbonate species were stronger than for bidentate carbonates. CexZr1-xO2 supports have attracted much attention for CO2 methanation due to the high capacity of oxygen storage, which led to about 98% selectivity towards CH4 [141]. It has been indicated that Zr addition to Ce could increase the amount of weak and medium basic sites, which have been reported to play an important role in CO2 methanation [137]. Alanda et al. [151] showed that by using an appropriate support, CH4 could be produced directly via the route of CO2 methanation. The ceria-zirconia support was capable of CO2 activation, while H2 activation occurred on Ni0 sites. However, in the presence of SiO2 support, Ni0 was found to be responsible for the activation of both CO2 and H2. The weak basic sites of the ceria-zirconia were found to be responsible for CO2 adsorption and its dissociation to carbonates, which could be hydrogenated to formates and consequently methoxy species [151]. Pan et al. [150] also proposed direct methanation routes of CO2 when Ni was supported on both alumina and ceria-zirconia materials. The basicity of the support could play a significant role in the catalyst activity. Providing medium basic sites, Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 enhances the formation of monodentate carbonates and consequently increased the CO2 methanation ability. The basic sites of γ-Al2O3 result in bidentate formates, which were less active in CO2 hydrogenation, as illustrated in Fig. 4. Vrijburg et al. [152] indicated that Ni/TiO2 catalysts had high CO2 methanation performance when promoted with Mn. MnO oxides could highly improve Ni dispersion, which led to high catalyst performance. In addition, oxophilic sites of MnO could increase CO2 activation. Moreover, DFT (density functional theory) calculations demonstrated that COH and HCO were the intermediates over Ni (311) and Mn4O4/Ni (111), respectively (Fig. 5). Additionally, on the former sites, CO2 adsorption was found to be the rate-determining step (RDS), whereas HCO dissociation was the RDS on the latter sites. Recently, 2D siloxene nanosheets (SiXNS) were proposed as effective supports for Ni by Yan et al. [153] due to their high catalytic performance in CO2 methanation. Different selectivity towards CH4 on Ni@SiXNS-H2O (54.3%) and Ni@SiXNS-EtOH (90%) was ascribed to different reaction mechanisms. It was demonstrated that over Ni@SiXNS-H2O CO2 dissociates to CO and O, while further CO dissociation and hydrogenation could result in CH4 formation. However, on Ni@SiXNS-EtOH the Ni active sites could form CH4 through a formate path as illustrated in Fig. 6. Metal-organic framework (MOF) derived catalysts, 20Ni@UiO-66, could effectively catalyze the CO2 methanation reaction at relatively low temperatures (about 300 °C) with 57.6 % conversion of CO2 and 100% selectivity towards methane [154]. This was attributed to the encapsulation of Ni NPs (nanoparticles) in the UiO-66 and uniform dispersion of these NPs in the MOF. Moreover, catalyst durability was outstanding during 100 h test. Cobalt (Co) is also an active element in CO2 methanation [155–157], and has been reported to enhance the dispersion of Ni while increasing the catalyst resistance to sintering [158]. Konsolakis et al. [159] compared Co and Cu-based catalysts in CO2 hydrogenation and observed that Co could drastically enhance selectivity toward CH4 while Cu favored the RWGS reaction, which led to CO production. Moreover, Xu et al. [160] demonstrated CO2 methanation over Ni-Co/Al2O3 (Fig. 7) and showed that Co induced CO2 dissociation, while Ni was active in H2 chemisorption and dissociation. Among the noble metals Rh and Ru have been considered as the most effective active sites for CO2 methanation [120] and bimetallic versions with more abundant non-precious metal components attract significant attention. Martin et al. [136] investigated the CO2 hydrogenation over ceria-supported Ni and Rh catalysts at atmospheric pressure. Activated CO2 on the Ce3+ sites could react with the dissociated hydrogen over Ni and Rh, which led to formate formation. Large Ni (6 nm) and small Rh (4 nm) nanoparticles were found on CeO2 as a support, which in turn led to weaker Ni-support interaction. Accordingly, Rh/CeO2 showed higher activity towards CH4 formation as depicted in Fig. 8. Heyl et al. [161] found that the addition of K to alumina-supported Rh and RhNi catalysts, led to the formation of an active intermediate that led to CO formation. In fact, K modified the Rh sites and facilitated CO desorption, while increasing the H2 dissociation ability of the catalyst as depicted in Fig. 9. Wang et al. [162] investigated the CO2 hydrogenation performance of alumina-supported Ru. Bicarbonate, which was formed through the interaction of CO2 with OH groups of the support, could be hydrogenated by the adsorbed hydrogens of the metal site to form formate. The addition of B was found to change the reaction pathway, since the hydroxyl groups of the Al2O3 support were completely neutralized, and CO was formed on Ru instead of formate species. CO hydrogenation leads to the formation of HCO, which can be further hydrogenated to form HCOH intermediates. CH4 can be then produced through the hydrogenation of CH, which is provided via the HCOH dissociation as depicted in Fig. 10 [163]. Oxygen species at the Ru-O-Al interface could effectively activate CO2 for subsequent methanation [164]. Dongapure et al. [166] demonstrated that TiO2 showed higher activity (4 to 5 fold) than Al2O3 when used as support for Ru. As illustrated in Fig. 11(a, b), Ru/TiO2 can dissociate CO2 to formate and formyl in shorter steps compared to Ru/Al2O3, which was attributed to the reduction capability of TiO2. In the past few years, the application of mesoporous and zeolitic supports such as MCM-41, Y-zeolite, USY, SBA, ZSM-5, BEA, etc. have also been investigated in the Sabatier reaction [167–169]. Wang et al. [170] studied the effect of ceria addition on the CO2 hydrogenation performance of MCM-41-supported Ni. Incorporation of about 20 wt% CeO2 resulted in remarkable enhancement in catalyst methanation performance in terms of both CO2 conversion (85.6%) and CH4 selectivity (99.8%) at 380 °C. The enhanced catalyst activity was attributed to the synergistic effects of CeO2 as a promoter, MCM-41 support and Ni0 sites. However, incorporation of excessive amounts of cerium decreased the catalyst activity (Fig. 12) due to decreased Ni reduction capability and consequently lower Ni0 content. The addition of 15 wt% Ce to a Ni-zeolite catalyst, also enhanced the CO2 conversion by 30%, leading to CH4 formation through the formate pathway [171]. The formyl and carbonyl species formed through CO2 dissociation on metallic sites, which were reported as the main intermediates in CH4 formation over Ni-USY zeolite at 350 °C (Fig. 13) [172]. In addition, the effect of various Ni-loaded support materials such as MCM-41, mesostructured silica nanoparticles (MSN), Al2O3, SiO2 and HY were compared by Aziz et al. [173]. Ni/MSN showed the best methanation performance with respect to the other catalysts due to high basicity, which favored CO2 hydrogenation via CO and atomic hydrogen formation as can be observed in Fig. 14. Moreover, Aziz et al. [174] demonstrated that Ni/MSN catalysts showed the best catalytic performance in CO2 methanation when compared to MSN supported Rh, Ru, Ir, Fe and Cu. It was indicated that dissociation of reacting molecules resulted in the formation of CO, H and O on the metal active sites, which transfer to the surface of the MSN. Bridged and linear carbonyls were formed via interaction of CO with surface oxides of the support, while bidentate formate species were formed due to atomic hydrogen (Fig. 15). Moreover, bidentate species were reported as the most important sources of CH4 formation. Chiang et al. [175] showed that MnFe2O4 and ZnFe2O4 are active catalysts in CO2 activation, due to the high reactivity of ferrite towards CO2 decomposition. In fact, metals such as Mn and Zn were reported to increase the oxygen-deficiency of ferrite, and in turn enhance the decomposition potential of divalent Fe sites. Oxygen-deficient catalysts could produce both C and CO as illustrated in Fig. 16. In the first path, methanation occurred via H2 treatment of the carbon deposited on the surface. In turn in the second path, with the metal-ferrite catalysts being less active, CH4 was produced via further reaction of H2 with CO [175]."
6,Effect of operating conditions on methanation,"2.2 Effect of operating conditions on methanation Products were predominantly CH4 along with H2O at rather low temperatures in the range of 200–250 °C. Increasing reaction temperature more than 450 °C increased the formation of CO by-product, according to the RWGS reaction (R3), while decreasing CO2 conversion and overall CH4 yield [176–180]. Considering that methane production from CO2 hydrogenation is highly exothermic, increased temperature was not beneficial for this reaction. However, as temperature surpassed 550 °C, CO2 mole fraction approached the highest value and then reduced since the RWGS reaction prevailed. Carbon deposition was also negligible under this condition. From a thermodynamic perspective, methane production from CO2 hydrogenation was supposed to occur through the following reactions (R17) as proposed by Park et al. [181]. (R17) Therefore, at high temperature, CO2 methanation includes a series of successive reactions, which begins with the RWGS, followed by the CO hydrogenation in the presence of steam when the ratio of H2/CO/H2O is 3/1/1. The addition of steam to the CO methanation reaction can inhibit carbon deposition. In the same way, compared to the mentioned reaction, CO2 methanation is favorable as well from a thermodynamic point of view. To achieve a desirable CH4 yield at atmospheric pressure, the reaction temperature should not surpass 300 °C. However, the eight-electron transfer of CO2 hydrogenation reaction to methane is challenging due to considerable kinetic barriers [182], which necessitate the development of a highly active catalyst capable of operation at such low temperatures. Gao et al. [183] studied the influence of temperature and pressure on the CO2 conversion during methanation (R1). Similar to the trend observed for CO methanation, the conversion of CO2 decreased as temperature was increased, but increased with pressure for temperatures lower than 600 °C. This effect was attributed to the exothermic nature of CO2 methanation along with a volume reduction during reaction (R1). As CO2 methanation proceeded above 600 °C at 1 atm, CO2 conversion increased steadily in contrast to what was observed in CO methanation. This was particularly due to the dominating RWGS reaction (R3) at temperatures higher than 600 °C. Gao et al. [183] also investigated the influence on CH4 selectivity, and observed that the direction of changes with temperature and pressure was identical to those observed in the CO methanation. These results at atmospheric pressure were in agreement with simulation results of Beuls et al. [117] and Ocampo et al. [184] for CO2 methanation, and also in accordance with the results observed by Du and co-workers over Ni/MCM-41 [185]. Gao et al. [183] concluded that CO2 methanation was harder than CO methanation under the same reaction conditions. However, below 500 °C, higher CH4 selectivity was achieved during CO2 methanation compared to that observed for CO methanation. Gao et al. [183] demonstrated the influence of pressure and temperature on CH4 yield. High pressure and low temperature promoted the CO2 methanation, in accordance to the predicted values from calculations for CO methanation. Moreover, carbon generation was found to be negligible under simulation conditions, due to H2O formation that inhibited carbon deposition during CO2 methanation. CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity follow a similar trend in the presence of almost all of the catalysts as represented in Fig. 17 [186]. While elevated pressure increased both CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity, raising temperature only has a positive effect on CO2 conversion, with CH4 selectivity passing through a maximum and decreasing for higher temperatures [187–189]. This can be accounted for considering the exothermic and reversible nature of the CO2 methanation reaction, which can result in high CH4 selectivity at moderate temperatures. In fact, for Co, Ru and Rh catalysts, the selectivity towards CH4 was found to be affected more by temperature as a result of their hydrogenation capabilities [190]. Moreover, high temperature led to catalyst deactivation, which can affect the thermodynamic equilibrium. Besides, as temperature increases, side reactions as well as the endothermic RWGS reaction proceeds more and CH4 selectivity decreases [191,192]. Gao et al. [183] also studied the influence of H2/CO2 ratio on methane production from CO2 and showed that CO2 conversion along with CH4 selectivity were considerably affected. Accordingly, high H2/CO2 ratio increased CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity at both atmospheric and high pressure (30 atm). When H2/CO2 is 2, about 50 to 70% CO2 conversion was obtained along with a CH4 selectivity (yield) of 73% (40%) and 88% (45%) at pressures of 1 and 30 atm, respectively. In addition, about 50% carbon deposition was observed at temperatures less than 500 °C at both pressures. However, at H2/CO2 ≥ 4, carbon deposition was not observed, which necessitates using H2/CO2 ratios higher than 4. Therefore, high pressure, low temperature, and an appropriate H2/CO2 ratio (more than 4) should be used for the optimized CO2 methanation. The best methane selectivity was obtained at temperatures around 300-350 °C along with high pressures, and a H2/CO2 ratio of 4. Moreover, the effect of water addition to feed gas was explored by Gao et al. [183], which led to a small reduction in CO2 conversion, while the CH4 selectivity and yield did not change significantly. Since H2O is one of the reaction products, this species prevents the CO2 methanation according to Le Chatelier's principle. However, no carbon deposition was observed when extra steam was included in the CO2 methanation reactor [183]. In this regard, the sorption-enhanced reactor has gained attention as a promising concept [193–195]. Accordingly, the catalyst support or some additive sorbents can adsorb the produced H2O during methanation, which can reduce the negative effects of water. Regeneration of the saturated catalyst can be accomplished via applying pressure and/or temperature swing processes [104]. Accordingly, zeolite-based materials have been proposed as promising candidates for water uptake. High Si/Al ratios have been speculated to have a negative effect on the water inhibition role of zeolitic materials. Utilization of zeolites Y, 13X and 5A has been reported to enhance water sorption during CO2 methanation resulting in comparable performance [167]. However, Aziz et al. [169] showed that the presence of water vapor reduced carbonyl species over Ni/MSN catalysts. In addition, Si-O-Si hydrolysis in the presence of adsorbed water by the MSN support collapsed the support structure. As reported by Bartholomew et al., [196] water can increase the sintering rate and collapse the support."
7,Effect of reactor configuration,"2.3 Effect of reactor configuration Owing to catalyst deactivation and thermodynamic limitations at high temperatures, various reactor configurations have been investigated to remove the released heat of the Sabatier reaction, which is a challenging issue even at steady-state conditions [197–199]. Since the Sabatier reaction is exothermic (R1), the consideration of appropriate cooling equipment in single and stage-wise reactors is of significant importance to prevent hot spots [98,200]. According to recent research, various catalytic configurations for CO2 methanation have been established, which are illustrated in Fig. 18. Fixed-bed reactors have been used widely in the CO2 methanation process [201–208], but only wall-cooled fixed-bed reactors have been commercialized. Recently, Pérez et al. [209] reported the application of a newly developed multichannel minireactor designed by Technical Research and Innovation (R&I) for the Sabatier reaction at temperatures ranging from 200 to 400 °C and 15 bar over Ni-based catalysts (Fig. 19). The multichannel minireactor showed a superior performance compared to a fixed-bed reactor. A maximum CH4 selectivity higher than 99% at 96.1% CO2 conversion was obtained at 350 °C. The small channel diameter results in better gas/particle contact while enhancing heat transfer, which could avoid the hot spot formation. This reactor was able to handle about 820 Nm3/h CO2 per square meter of channel at the best performance. According to simulation studies, the occurrence of hot spots is inevitable in such reactors, even while using undiluted and stoichiometric H2/CO2 mixtures as feed gas, and even at small reactor diameters [210,211]. However, the occurrence of considerable hot spots should be prohibited, due to safety issues of the process. Therefore, various reactor configurations along with feed and catalyst dilution have been proposed for reactor temperature control [212,213]. Moreover, exploitation of heat exchangers and multiple reactors in series [214] or even advanced control methods, which employ unstable operation points of the reactor have been proposed [215]. Although these ideas can be useful for steady-state operation, some of them show undesirable results under transient conditions, as reported by Quina and Ferreira [216] for catalyst dilution. Optimizing the interactions of reaction rate, heat and mass transport at a particle scale, Schlereth and Hinrichsen [210] assessed the probability of reactor temperature control. However, the application of this method was not investigated. As a result of numerous degrees of freedom, this is not a trivial accomplishment for many systems with definite constraints, as reported in the literature. For instance, particles with radial distribution of the active material in the porous matrix have been considered frequently. Amongst these, ‘egg-shell’ particles were regularly preferred, since they had active layers close to the catalyst surface, which reduce the heat and mass transport resistances [217,218]. In addition, using such particles led to lower consumption of expensive material in the reactor without reducing the performance. Wu et al. [219, 220] have experimentally shown for the CO methanation, that the carbon selectivity and deposition can be significantly affected via the spatial distribution of the active material in the catalyst particles. Furthmore, configured fixed-beds with stacking several beds containing different catalysts allow operation at a temperature lower by approximately 100 °C [205]. Moreover, Miguel et al. [221] studied the application of cyclic adsorption/reaction process where CO2 was adsorbed using the K-promoted hydrotalcite sorbent and subsequently hydrogenated in the reaction section over Ni-based catalyst. The process was performed in two columns switching from CO2 adsorption to methanation reaction. Giglio et al. [222] proposed a methanation process coupling with a steam electrolysis system for removing the reaction heat of the multi-tube fixed beds. Accordingly, a high-temperature steam, which was produced via removing the reactor heat, could supply the required H2 for the methanation of CO2 via a solid oxide electrolyzer. Prairie et al. [223] demonstrated the advantage of using a continuous recycle, fixed-bed/ DRIFTS (diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy) cell reactor for CO2 methanation over Ru/TiO2. Sun et al. [224] studied a fluidized-bed reactor theoretically and showed that the appropriate recycle ratio could result in higher yields of CH4 while prohibiting hot spots. However, the modeling investigation of the fixed-bed reactors by Ducamp et al. [225] showed that reaction heat could not be removed from the fixed-beds effectively. They proposed using modular plate reactor-heat exchangers with millimeter-scale catalysts distributed in their layers, for enhanced heat transfer. In addition, compared to metallic foam reactors and milli-structured fixed beds, annular fixed-bed reactors had higher CO2 conversion (about 95%) at a dilution factor of 3 using the same catalysts. However, dilution led to additional separation costs. In addition, milli-structured reactors showed high productivity as well as high space-time yields [98]. Coupling two fixed-bed reactors for sorption and reaction of CO2 was proposed by Miguel et al. [221]. The sorption part comprised a hydrotalcite packing promoted by K, while the reaction section included Ni-based catalysts at low pressures (approximately 2.5 bar). Although the materials were commercially available and a high CO2 conversion was achieved, the CH4 purity reached only 37% at 350 °C, which therefore asks for further design improvements. The same process was proposed by Veselovskaya et al. [226] where K2CO3/Al2O3 and NKM-2V (commercial nickel catalyst) were used in the first and second fixed-beds, respectively. In addition, Gruber et al. [227] suggested a two-stage reactor with different catalyst thicknesses to decrease the amount of required catalyst and reactor length. However, optimization of the operating conditions and heat transfer required further investigations to ensure the economy of the system. Götz et al. [228] used a three-phase methanation reactor for studying heat transfer and hydrodynamic stability. The Key Laboratory of Coal Science and Technology of Taiyuan (China) concentrated on the development of optimized catalysts for three-phase methanation processes [229,230]. In three-phase reactors, the liquid phase is characterized by a high heat capacity which allows for accurate and effective reactor temperature control. The reactor can be operated under isothermal process conditions even at high load variations [231]. Weaknesses of this configuration of reactor are related to the additional gas–liquid mass transfer resistance as well as to the decomposition and evaporation of the heat transfer fluid [232]. Besides thermal catalytic reactors, dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma reactors have recently attracted attention owing to the improvements of catalyst performance at lower temperatures [233–239]. Hybrid plasma-catalytic reactors [240,241] exhibit more than 75% CO2 conversion along with 90% selectivity at 90 °C, while in the absence of plasma negligible conversion was reported at the same temperature. In addition, Azzolina-Jury et al. [242] compared both in-plasma catalysis (IPC) and post-plasma catalysis (PPC) for low pressure CO2 methanation over Ni/ZSM-11 and Ni/USY catalysts (Fig. 20). It was observed that CH4 production was only possible in IPC mode at low temperature (∼125 °C); significantly lower than conventional reactors which require ∼ 400 °C. In addition CO2 conversion in IPC mode was increased to 60-70% from 0-30% in the conventional reactor. However, more comprehensive insight with respect to the operating conditions as well as power, voltage, discharge length and configuration is required for commercial implementation. The summary of previous experimental research for methane production from CO2 is presented in Table 1 ."
8,Methanol synthesis,"Methanol is an alternative fuel, a common solvent, and a starting material in the chemical industry. Indeed, CO can be replaced with CO2 as a potent route for utilization of CO2 in methanol production [243–250] as represented in (R2). From a thermodynamic aspect, temperature reduction or pressure elevation could favor methanol synthesis. There is evidence that improved reaction temperature (higher than 240 °C) facilitates CO2 activation and synthesis of methanol [251–254]. However, many by-products are formed during the CO2 hydrogenation, like carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons (HCs), formic acid and ethanol [255–259], which necessitates the selection of a highly selective catalyst toward methanol. Usually, catalysts employed in the CO2 hydrogenation are the same as used in the CO hydrogenation for methanol synthesis. Researchers have shown that the catalyst type, operating conditions, and reactor configuration play a critical role in the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol as discussed below."
9,Development of catalysts and mechanism in methanol synthesis,"3.1 Development of catalysts and mechanism in methanol synthesis Many types of metal-based catalysts have been studied for methanol synthesis, and copper (Cu) has turned out as a majorly active catalytic element, using different promoters such as B, Si, Zn, Ag, Cr, Ti, Ce, Zr, Al, V, Ga, etc. [260–268]. Although Cu-based catalysts have been studied extensively, their deactivation, sintering and phase segregation in CO2 hydrogenation processes have created great incentives to explore for novel materials. In this regard, Indium oxide (In2O3) has been identified as an emerging material in methanol synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation due to its high selectivity and stability [269-272]. Based on DFT calculations, it was suggested that oxygen defective sites played an important role in CO2 activation and hydrogenation [273–275]. Moreover, suitable supports can affect the stabilization and formation of catalytic active phases as well as adjusting the interactions between the promoter and the major component of catalyst [276–283]. In addition, the acid/base properties of the catalyst are also determined by the support type [284,285]. The main catalytic materials used for methanol production are depicted in Scheme 4 . Accordingly, Cu has been the most widespread metal followed by Pd and bimetallic catalysts. Cu-ZnO-Al2O3 has been the most widely used catalyst for CO2 transformation to methanol. ZrO2, CeO2, Ga2O3 and TiO2 have been other materials used in combination with Cu-ZnO, while Al2O3 and ZrO2 have been the most common supports. However, Ga2O3, CeO2, SiO2 and zeolites have been the most appropriate supports for Pd-based catalysts. Among bimetallic catalysts, Ni-Ga has been the most popular followed by Co-Cu, Pd-Cu and Au-Cu (or Ag) [286]. The In-based catalysts have demonstrated comparable performance in bifunctional catalysts such as Pd-In [287–289], Zr-In [290,291] and composite In-based oxides/zeolite [292–295]. Zhao et al. [296] proposed three pathways for methanol formation over Cu-based catalysts as illustrated in Scheme 5 . In the first route, CO2 adsorption occurs via formate (HCOO) formation through the Eley-Rideal or Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanisms. H2COO then forms via formate hydrogenation, which can be further hydrogenated to methoxy (H3CO) and finally methanol (H3COH). The second pathway comprises stepwise CO2 hydrogenation and CO bond scissions, which starts with hydrocarboxyl (COOH) formation, followed by isomerization of dihydroxylcarbenes (-C(OH)2). COH species then form via OH scission of dihydroxylcarbenes and transforms to HCOH species after the addition of H-atoms. Further hydrogenation of this intermediate, results in methanol production. The third route begins similar to the second path and proceeds via CO formation (RWGS). Further hydrogenation results in the formation of HCO, adsorbed methoxy and eventually methanol. Comparing the suggested pathways, the hydrocarboxyl route (second route) was the most favorable among others due to lower energy barriers [296,297]. Various metal oxides have been used as additives (support, promoter or active site) to catalyze CO2 hydrogenation to methanol [298–304]. Investigating the CO2 hydrogenation mechanism over Cu/ZnO/Al2O3, Kattel et al. [305] showed that the synergy between ZnO and Cu due to well-distributed ZnO on Cu surface, results in methanol production through a formate path. In addition, Larmier et al. [306] also demonstrated that formate was an important intermediate in methanol production over Cu/ZrO2. Cu/Al2O3 was also reported to transform CO2 to methanol via a formate pathway as a result of Lewis acid sites of the non-reducible support [307]. Chen et al. [308] showed that the formate path was preferable over the Cu-LaOx interface compared to the hydrocarboxyl path as depicted in Fig. 21 . It was reported that 81.2% methanol selectivity at 6% CO2 conversion was achieved during 100 h. LaOx enhanced Cu dispersion and consequently improved CO2 adsorption. Yao et al. [309] showed that synergy between Cu (active in H2 dissociation) and In2O3 (responsible for CO2 adsorption) resulted in 79.7% selectivity towards methanol at 250 °C. Two RDS paths comprising formate formation via CO2 hydrogenation and methanol formation from methoxy were distinguished in the formate pathway as depicted in Fig. 22 . Wang et al. [310] proposed the use of visible light irradiation to excite electrons over Cu-ZnO and demonstrated that reaction intermediates activated easier. Accordingly, a 40% reduction in the activation energy along with a 54% increase in methanol production was attributed to photo-mediated catalysis via the formate pathway as illustrated in Fig. 23 . As a promoter, ZnO could enhance the stabilization and dispersion of Cu [311–313], with lattice oxygen vacancies, in ZnO and lattice electron pairs active in methanol formation [284]. Fujita et al. [314] reported high selectivity toward methanol (67.2%) over Cu/ZnO as a result of high Cu dispersion and formation of Cu (111) and Cu (100) flat surfaces. Employing solvated metal atom dispersion (SMAD) method, Ponce et al. [315] prepared Cu nanocrystalline (NC) particles to fabricate Cu/pentane/NC–ZnO, which resulted in 80% CO2 conversion at 450 °C. A dual-site mechanism has been proposed for methanol synthesis over Cu/ZnO catalysts, where Cu is responsible for hydrogen dissociation and ZnO activates CO2 in the form of bicarbonate. In addition, ZnOx sites are active in methanol formation while ZnO species favor CO production [316–318]. In order to further increase the efficiency of the Cu/ZnO catalyst, a promoter (Ga2O3) and stabilizer (SiO2) were employed [319]. The size of Ga2O3 particles could affect their promoting role. The formation of Cu+, which is an intermediate state, was reported due to the small Ga2O3 particle size [319,320]. In addition, the utilization of methoxide-acetylacetonate instead of nitrate precursor resulted in better Cu dispersion in Cu–Ga/ZnO catalyst [320]. Noble metals have been reported to have great potential for hydrogen activation via the hydrogen-spillover mechanism. Accordingly, Pd was used for the modification of Cu/Zn/Al2O3 and Cu/ZnO catalysts [321,322], which by forming a highly reduced catalyst surface accelerated the hydrogenation process [321]. To efficiently enhance the activity and durability of the Cu/ZnO catalysts, Al2O3 has also been used as promoter or support [308,323–326]. However, the catalyst performance has not been satisfactory since the hydrophilic Al2O3 resulted in water accumulation, which reduced the catalyst efficiency. Using kinetic modeling techniques, Wilkinson et al. [327] studied the mechanism of methanol formation over Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts. They used both CO and CO2 in the feed and demonstrated that CO2 transferred to both CO and bidentate CO2 along with surface oxygen species (Fig. 24 ), which results in the formation of carbonate and consequently methanol. ZrO2 has been proposed as both promoter and support by many researchers [328–331] owing to its high mechanical, chemical and thermal stability in reduction/oxidation processes [332–336]. In addition, improved Cu dispersion over ZrO2 has been reported to enhance the catalytic efficiency in methanol production [329,337, 338]. About 1-2 wt% Cu loading on ZrO2 resulted in the same yields with a ZnO/Al2O3 supported Cu catalyst including 45-50 wt% Cu. In addition, ZrO2 showed the best performance in combination with Cu compared to other additives like TiO2, SiO2 and Al2O3 in methanol formation via CO2 hydrogenation [339,340]. Moreover, amorphous ZrO2 could stabilize tiny Cu particles, which also enhanced Cu-ZrO2 interactions and led to higher selectivity towards methanol (Fig. 25 ). The role of the crystal structure is still under debate since both t-(tetragonal) and m-(monoclinic) ZrO2 were able to modify the catalyst surface properties via changing the formation of oxygen vacancies as depicted in Fig. 25 [339]. In general, m-ZrO2 exhibits higher concentration of Brønsted center Zr–OH groups, stronger Lewis acidity of Zr4+ ions, as well as stronger Lewis basicity of O2− ions [341,342]. However, Zr crystal types can influence catalyst performance [343,344] and Cu/m-ZrO2 was reported to be more active than Cu/t-ZrO2 as a result of the increased concentration of HCOO and CH3O as active intermediates [344]. For instance, Cu/ZrO2 [344] and Cu–ZnO–ZrO2 catalysts [345] prepared with m-ZrO2 exhibit higher activity and methanol selectivity than the counterparts prepared with t-ZrO2. By contrast, Samson et al. [341] indicated that the methanol synthesis rate rises with growing t-ZrO2 content, and the presence of oxygen vacancies stabilizes the thermodynamically unstable t-ZrO2 phase at low temperature and Cu+ ions. More recently, Lam et al. [262] claimed that isolated Lewis acidic Zr(IV) surface sites in SiO2 are adequate to assist CO2 activation and promote CO2 hydrogenation, although the structural and bulk properties of ZrO2 (e.g., oxygen vacancies) had a negligible effect. Incorporation of other components such as Al, B and Ga decreases the rate of water adsorption, and improves Cu dispersion along with the increasing concentration of ZrO2, which enhances catalyst activity [346–349]. Generally, Cu/ZnO offers higher CO2 activation while Cu/ ZrO2 provides higher selectivity towards methanol. Therefore, ternary Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 has been proposed to combine the two advantages [339]. Adsorption of CO2 on the ZrO2 surface leads to bicarbonate formation, which can be transferred to formate intermediate via hydrogenation [350]. The required hydrogen for this step could be supplied by hydrogen-spillover on Cu [351,352]. Kattel et al. [353] proposed that methanol formation occurs through carboxyl path over Cu/ZrO2 as depicted in Fig. 26 (a). However, a “formate” pathway was proposed over Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 [329] and Cu-ZnO-ZrO2 [355] catalysts as can be observed in Fig. 26 (b) and (c). Furthermore, the addition of MgO to Cu-ZnO-ZrO2/Al2O3 could prevent CH4 production via increasing alkali sites over the catalyst surface. Besides, this modification resulted in the formation of Cu0, which is an active site for the CO2 hydrogenation to methanol synthesis [326]. Using hydrophobic SiO2 as supports for multi-component catalysts led to stability and efficiency at temperatures up to 270 °C [319]. It was demonstrated that the addition of 1 wt% SiO2 to the CuO-ZnO-ZrO2 catalysts increased the methanol production activity of about 26% due to enhanced dispersion of components. In addition, the RWGS reaction proceeded through a redox mechanism rather than the formate path as illustrated in Fig. 27 [356]. In addition to Cu, Au, Pd, In and Ag were among the elements that provided superior activity in the CO2 hydrogenation to methanol [357–361]. Lin et al. [354] investigated the role of various supports on the performance of Pd-Cu catalysts. TiO2 and ZrO2 supported PdCu3 catalysts exhibited the best methanol production capability compared to PdCu3/CeO2 (Fig. 28 ). This was attributed to strong CO2 adsorption sites which were provided by the abundant oxygen vacancies. Pd-ZnO/MWCNTs catalysts showed excellent performance in the methanol production due to increasing Pd0 concentration as active species [362]. Hydrogen could be adsorbed reversibly on these catalysts and increased the rate of surface hydrogenation by favoring higher active hydrogen concentration. Moreover, hydrogen that was transferred to Ga2O3 after dissociation on Pd, could react with surface-bound molecules. Besides, forming Pd–Ga active sites favored methanol production in the presence of the Pd/Ga2O3 catalyst [363–365]. In addition, Liaw et al. [260] reported that promoting CuB with Zr, Cr and Th could enhance the catalyst stability along with Cu dispersion, which led to enhanced methanol formation. A comprehensive study was performed to recognize the intermediates for the synthesis of methanol from hydrogenation of CO2 over various catalysts like Pd/β-Ga2O3 using FT-IR spectroscopy in-situ [366]. The reaction followed the formate pathway that continued via the formation of HCOO, H2COO, CH3O, and CH3OH as the final products depicted in Fig. 29 (a). Oxygen vacancies can be filled and generated with the formation of methanol and H2, respectively, which results in a mechanism including cyclic formation and extinction of oxygen vacancies Fig. 29 (b). Tsoukalou et al. [272] studied the structural transition of In2O3 throughout CO2 hydrogenation using X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES), extended X-ray absorption fine structural spectroscopy (EXAFS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Slight reduction of In–O coordination numbers along with partial reduction of In2O3 were detected during activation, in accordance with oxygen vacancy generation, which led to the formation of In2O3−x active phase. Further reductive amorphization of In2O3−x results in In0 formation and finally catalyst deactivation. Chen et al. [291] performed a mechanistic investigation of CO2 hydrogenation over Inx/ZrO2 catalyst. This catalyst was capable of methanol production via hydrogenation of HCOO. However, low loading (< 0.5 wt%) catalysts were active in CO formation while higher loadings resulted in methanol synthesis as can be observed in Fig. 30 . Moreover, Martin et al. [269] showed that, introduction of CO in the feed flow could increase the oxygen vacancies and consequently enhance the performance of the In2O3/ZrO2 catalysts. Zander et al. [368] concluded that active catalysts should address the requirements, comprising: high specific SA (surface area) Cu in order to display active sites; defective Cu surface including high-energy sites; and SMSI (strong metal–support interaction) induced cooperation of ZnO for the activation of defect sites as represented in Scheme 6 . Therefore, a variety of studies have been reported with regard to the bi-functional catalysts consisting of Cu and HZSM-5 used for the direct hydrogenation of CO2. Recently the performance of new catalysts comprising metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been investigated in the CO2 hydrogenation to methanol [369–372]. An et al. [373] showed that UiO-bpy addition to the Cu/ZnO catalysts could reduce Cu agglomeration and Cu-ZnOx phase separation as well. Accordingly, Cu-ZnOx@MOF showed 100% methanol selectivity and 2.59 gMeOH/kgCu h methanol yield that has been attributed to strong interactions between Cu nanoparticles and the MOF structure. Based on the proposed mechanism over this promising catalyst, dissociated H2 on Cu could spillover to both defects and Zr while both Zn and Zr sites have been found to be active in the formation of bicarbonates and carbonates via CO2 adsorption (Fig. 31 ). Rungtaweevoranit et al. [374] also demonstrated that the encapsulation of Cu nanoparticles inside UiO-66 MOF could lead to 100% selectivity towards methanol due to strong Cu-MOF interactions. Secondary building units of Zr were better than ZrO2 metal oxides at Cu sites for methanol synthesis. The results of previous experimental works for methanol production from CO2 hydrogenation are displayed in Table 2 . Over the past few decades, there has been significant debate regarding the reaction routes for methanol formation from CO2, which has focused on two main species, specifically carboxyl (COOH*) and formate (HCOO*), whose formation starts with separate primary hydrogenation steps. The CO2 HOMO (1πg) and LUMO (2πu) orbitals are situated near to O and C atoms, respectively. The latter is recognized as a poor electron donor (Lewis base), while the former can be considered as a poor electron acceptor (Lewis acid). CO2 can be transferred to COOH* and HCOO* via reacting with proton and hydride, respectively. Recently, some advances have been made for detecting the main intermediates, especially for Cu-based catalysts using the combination of computational approaches and in-situ characterization [306]. Therefore, an improved understanding about reaction mechanisms and insight from theoretical studies can guide the design of more efficient catalyst. This section includes mechanistic insights via both experimental and theoretical results, with special emphasis on catalysts containing transition and precious metals (monometallic Cu and Cu/oxides). Significant kinetic models are included to provide instructions for mechanistic investigations from an experimental viewpoints, and includes the influence of additional H2O on methanol synthesis activity. Yang et al. [375] investigated Cu(111), and Cu/ZnO (000 1 ¯ ) catalytic activities in methanol formation and showed that supported Cu-NPs on a single ZnO(000 1 ¯ ) crystal had higher activity. This high activity was attributed to the stabilization of formate species in the presence of Cu-NP sites. The formation of formate intermediate is kinetically favored in CO2 hydrogenation, which results in methanol formation over Cu surfaces. The design strategy is proposed via combining experimental investigations and DFT, where introducing promoters or dopants can fix formyl or promote formate and dioxomethylene hydrogenation, and might be capable of enhancing methanol yield [375]. Based on this theory, Yang et al. [376] studied the influence of doping with transition metals on Cu(111) to produce methanol via CO2 hydrogenation. The DFT studies revealed that the yield of methanol increased in the following order: Au/Cu(111) < Cu(111) < Pd/Cu(111) < Ph/Cu(111) < Pt/Cu(111) < Ni/Cu(111). The path within RWGS+CO-Hydro including a COOH* species moved forward more rapidly than that through the HCOO* intermediate, showing that addition of dopants could change the controlling path of methanol formation. The same results were indicated by Liu et al. [377] about the enhancement of methanol synthesis via adding Rh as dopant, in different amounts, over Cu(111). Accordingly, the adsorption intensity of the main species could be changed, the rate-determining step (RDS) was altered, and byproduct (CO) yield was reduced, resulting in promoted kinetics for the methanol production. Besides the effect of doping, the size of Cu-NP clusters were influential in methanol formation path. Zhang et al. [378] anticipated that medium-sized Cu19 cluster had the maximum activity in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol among other Cu clusters like Cu(111), Cu13, Cu(211) and Cu55. A lower decomposition barrier of CO2 and modest surface coverage were reported to explain the high activity of Cu19 cluster. Linear scaling relations were detected for binding energies of O* and CO* with the activation barriers of the primary steps of methanol formation from CO2 hydrogenation. Varying cluster sizes alters the d-band center of Cu clusters, which modifies the adsorption stabilities for reaction species, leading to size-dependent activity of methanol synthesis, with smaller clusters more active [379]. In addition, defects in Cu-based catalysts were identified to have an important role on the methanol formation activity/selectivity [380]. On the kink and step surfaces of Cu(211), barriers for CO2 hydrogenation to COOH* and HCOO* were considerably lower than observed on Cu(111) terraces. Over Cu(111), COOH* and HCOO* were competitive, while the Cu(211) surfaces promotes preferential HCOO* formation. When a Cu atom on the surface of Cu(211) was replaced with a single Zn atom, methanol synthesis activity was remarkably enhanced. This enhancement was a consequence of the easier HCOO* formation via CO2 hydrogenation in addition to reinforcing the binding energies of main intermediates containing O like HCOO* over surfaces modified with Zn. Grabow et al. [381] performed an extensive mechanistic investigation of methanol formation over Cu(111) via hydrogenation of CO and CO2 through combining microkinetic modeling and DFT. Possible routes are suggested, where CO2 hydrogenation to methanol proceeds in the order of CO2* → HCOO* → HCOOH* → H2COOH* → CH2O* → CH3O* → CH3OH* (Fig. 32 ), which was not the same as reported by Yang et al. [375] where HCOO* → H2COO* → H2CO* were deemed as primary steps in the route based on formate. The formation of methanol could be restricted via CH3O* hydrogenation in streams rich in CO2, where CO could enhance CO2 hydrogenation via either OH* removal via the WGS reaction or through a HCO* path for methanol synthesis [381]. Yang et al. [382–384] studied the mechanism and the water influence in methanol formation through hydrogenation of CO2 and CO2-containing syngas over Cu catalysts. A thorough scheme comprising probable reaction steps originated from either mixed CO2+CO or pure CO2/CO hydrogenations is displayed in Fig. 33 . Methanol synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation mostly goes through the “formate” route (left path), while a formyl-based route is taken when CO replaces CO2 (right path). The proposed mechanism, whereby CO* is formed through carboxyl via O–CO bond activation and decomposition is above this scheme [381]. In addition, a “middle” route, suggested by Zhao et al. [296] probably appears via carboxyl in CO2 hydrogenation, which is more kinetically favorable as a result of lower energy barriers as shown by DFT. Kattel et al. [305] investigated active sites of methanol formation from CO2 hydrogenation over Cu/ZnO. Comparison of ZnCu and ZnO/Cu catalysts was performed via integrating KMC (kinetic Monte Carlo) simulations, DFT calculations and XPS (X-ray photoemission spectroscopy) measurements. Results revealed that the formate path was feasible over ZnCu(211), which was in accordance with the results described by Behrens et al. [385]. The surface of ZnO/Cu(111) also could promote the formate path compared to the “RWGS + CO-Hydro” pathway, while CO was the main product as a result of reduced binding strength of CO* that prevented its hydrogenation to HCO* [305]. As mentioned previously, two feasible routes namely HCOO* and COOH* have remained under discussion. Formate intermediate is deemed a significant species in the methanol formation over Cu catalysts as adsorption of formate and its hydrogenation to methoxy intermediates are observed via FT-IR spectra [386,387]. However, Clarke et al. [388] revealed the effect of carboxyl species in methanol synthesis, suggesting that carboxyl could proceed by isomerization to form the formate, and subsequently methanol. Nevertheless, carboxyl intermediates were barely observed in DRIFTS, showing the necessity of operando transient techniques. Several investigations emphasized the influence of various oxide supports except ZnO, like TiO2 [353], ZrO2 [353], mixed CeOx/TiO2 oxides [389] and CeOx [390] for methanol formation. Graciani et al. [389] demonstrated a distinct class of active site at Cu–Ce interfaces for CO2 activation that resulted in particular routes (Fig. 34 ) through CO2* → COOH* → CO* → CHO* → CH2O* → CH3O* → CH3OH*. The mentioned route differed from that designated over monometallic Cu(111) that favored HCOO* generation instead of COOH* [375,381]. This study showed the influence of oxide supports along with interfacial sites of metal-oxides in modifying CO2 activation, changing kinetics and reaction routes, subsequently altering the selectivity toward methanol. Also, the COOH* route was valid on Cu/ZrO2 and Cu/TiO2 as demonstrated by Kattel et al. [353] via combined KMC simulations, DFT and in-situ DRIFTS. ZrO2 was more efficient compared to TiO2 in enhancing catalyst activity and methanol selectivity as a result of synergistic effects between Cu and Zr3+, which facilitated the “RWGS+CO-Hydro” route and hindered catalyst poisoning. Huge amounts of HCOO* intermediates were detected using in-situ DRIFTS, and supported via DFT predictions for the mentioned supported materials, which were poisonous for catalyst surfaces [353]. Water is one of the byproducts of the CO2 hydrogenation, and its accumulation leads to Cu-ZnO catalyst deactivation as a result of sintering [391,392], particularly at high CO2 conversion [393,394]. Unfortunately, their utilization as low-temperature catalysts is hampered by accumulation of carbon-derived species [395]. Conversely, other studies showed that H2O could impose a positive influence or even contribute in methanol synthesis. Zhao et al. [296] investigated the effect of water in the methanol synthesis over Cu(111) using DFT. Immediate formate hydrogenation over Cu(111) was unfavorable because of high activation barriers of consecutive steps like HCOO* to H2COO* and H2COO* to H2CO*, whereas hydrogenation of CO2 to a trans-COOH* species was feasible kinetically. Especially, when one molecule of H2O was considered in calculations, formation of COOH* continued via a unique mechanism, where the adsorbed hydrogen of surface was transferred to water molecules that simultaneously gave one of its protons to the CO2. Water participation in this reaction could remarkably decrease the barrier of hydrogenation from 1.16 to 0.17 eV. In the vicinity of water, the favorable route of methanol formation was suggested to proceed via the following sequence of reactions: CO2* + 6H* + (H2O) → trans-COOH* + 5H* → t,t-COHOH* + 4H* → t,c-COHOH* + 4H* → c,c-COHOH* + 4H* → COH* + OH* + 4H* → HCOH* + 3H* + OH* → H2COH* + 2H* + OH* → H3COH* + H* + OH* → H3COH* + H2O*. The role of water in either pure CO2 or its mixture with CO via experimental and computational techniques was investigated by Yang et al. [383]. Results revealed that both H2O and H2O-derived intermediates acted as crucial reactants and co-reactants in the RWGS and methanol synthesis on Cu surface. The mentioned reactions could be promoted via addition of small amounts of H2O (approximately 0.04–0.5% mole fraction). Recently, Wang et al. [396] showed strong evidence about the positive effect of proper H2O concentration in enhancing the yield of methanol on Cu-ZnO-ZrO2 (CZZ). Surface methoxy hydrolysis resulted in methanol formation, which could be promoted by desorbed water vapor. Moreover, they altered water diffusion in CZZ through surface and/or structural modification. 3D-ordered macroporous CZZ (M-CZZ) with improved diffusion of water vapor showed considerably enhanced methanol formation rates and selectivity compared to those over CZZ catalyst fabricated by coprecipitation (C-CZZ), as shown in Table 2 [93]. Nie et al. [397] investigated the influence of water on the surface of alloyed PdCu(111) using both experimental and DFT studies and reported that H2O was able to affect the elementary energetics and surface chemistry. The presence of a small fraction of H2O reduced kinetic barriers via altering “H-transfer” mechanism in hydrogenation reactions (Fig. 35 (a,b)), along with changing the RDS. According to Fig. 35 (c,d), water participated in the process and remarkably influenced the formation of OH bonds, while having a negligible role on the formation of CH bonds. H2O reduced the activation barrier of primary RDSs, HCOO* → HCOOH*, from 1.28 eV to 0.58 eV in the “formate” pathway. In addition, water shifted the RDS to HCOOH* → H2COOH* (0.82 eV) as a CH bond formation step. In the “RWGS+CO-Hydro” path via COOH* species, water contributed in primary steps, comprising CO2* → COOH* → CO* + H2O*, along with the methanol formation step, CH3O* → CH3OH*. DFT calculations showed that CO formation proceeded more quickly compared to the CH3OH formation with H2O contribution, which was in accordance with experimental results. The synergetic role of a proper concentration of H2O for methanol formation was supported by experimental investigations in this study [398]. Recently, Xu et al. [399] studied the effect of H2O/H2O-derived intermediates in methanol synthesis over Cu(211) via microkinetic modeling along with DFT calculations. In contrast to Cu(111)-based catalysts [400,401], the presence of water in the vicinity of Cu(211) increased the energy barriers of HCOO* and COOH* formation. However, the presence of water-derived intermediates like O* and OH* over Cu(211) increased the turnover frequency of methanol synthesis that was ascribed to the reduced adsorption of formate as a surface poisoning intermediate and decreased energies of the rate-controlling states. On the basis of Gibbs free energy barriers, introducing water as the source of hydrogen via OH breakage could not promote CO2 hydrogenation, as proposed by Jiang et al. [93] which is not consistent with suggestions from earlier studies [397,400,401], where water acted as a “H shuttling medium” from Cu surfaces to the CO2. However, Martin et al. [269] demonstrated that the decrease in the reaction rate on the In2O3-based catalysts was only 20% in the presence of water, which was considerably lower compared to that of Cu-ZnO-Al2O3 (70%). Accordingly, In2O3-based catalyst may be a promising alternative for Cu-based catalysts for methanol production in the harsh environment."
10,Effect of operating conditions on methanol synthesis,"3.2 Effect of operating conditions on methanol synthesis Generally, catalysts show rather low CO2 conversion at low or ambient pressure, which leads to low methanol yield [286,402]. The reaction conditions (e.g. H2/CO2 ratio, space velocity, pressure and temperature) have an outstanding influence on the methanol yield [403–405]. As a whole, increasing reaction pressure, space velocity and H2/CO2 ratio promote methanol synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation [406,407]. Thermodynamically, high pressure is favorable for CO2 conversion while efficiently reducing the reactor volume and plant area, which decreases the total capital cost. However, due to safety considerations, pressure increases from ambient up to 10 MPa. Recently, advantages of high-pressure methods in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol were experimentally confirmed [408,409]. At 260 °C and 331 bar (partial pressure of the reactants), extremely high CO2 conversion (about 95%) along with approximately 98% methanol selectivity were achieved on Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts [408]. In addition, for a feed stream with a H2:CO2 ratio of 10, high methanol productivity with 7.7 gMeOH gcat −1 h−1 weight time yield (WTY) was achieved at GHSV of 182 000 h−1 at the cost of lower CO2 conversion (65.8%) and methanol selectivity (77.3%) (Table 2). The effects of phase behavior, kinetics and thermodynamics on methanol production were also investigated, and at 442 bar, WTY of 15.3 gMeOH gcat −1 h−1 was achieved [409]. Gaikwad et al. [409] studied the influence of temperature on methanol formation at different pressures from 46 to 442 bar when GHSV = 10000 h−1 (Fig. 36 ). In addition, reactor performance at thermodynamic equilibrium was also represented (dotted lines). It was observed that at lower pressure (46 bar), CO2 conversion decreased slightly (from about 30 to 20%) with temperature increase (from 220 to 300 °C), while methanol selectivity decreased considerably from about 90 % to 20%. Elevated pressure, led to improved methanol selectivity and CO2 conversion, with selectivity found to be approximately constant over the entire temperature range explored, highlighting the advantage of high pressure conditions. For instance, at 442 bar, CO2 conversion was between 86.1% and 98.7%, while selectivity towards methanol varied between 99% and 99.9% at the studied temperature range. The usual gas-phase process suffers from some drawbacks like catalyst deactivation due to sintering, the required recycling of unconverted gas due to thermodynamic equilibrium, and the slight one-pass CO2 conversion restricted by the huge heat release during the reaction [251]. Therefore, innovation in process technology is of great practical importance in CO2 hydrogenation. By the end of the 1970s, a liquid-phase methanol (LPMeOH) production method from syngas was developed by Air Products & Chemicals [410]. The operation of the LPMeOH™ Demonstration Unit, which is located at Eastman's chemicals-from-coal complex in Tennessee, USA began in 1997. In this process, a slurry bubble column reactor (SBCR) is used, while an inert solvent (high-boiling-point mineral oil) enters the reactor to release the heat of exothermal reactions. The reactant gas bubbles up through the catalyst slurry to suspend the catalyst in mineral oil. Water and methanol can be separated from the solvent via cooling, while the solvent is recycled to the reactor. The liquid-phase methanol production exhibits several benefits like [411,412] (i) efficient heat release from exothermic reaction and excellent reactor temperature tuning, (ii) high conversion per pass, which reduces the recycle ratio of unreacted gas while keeping the recycle ratio lower than that in normal gas-phase reactors, (iii) and moderate process temperature, which leads to higher catalyst stability while restricting catalyst deactivation due to hot spots. In addition, the Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth (RITE) and the National Institute for Resources and Environment (NIRE) investigated liquid-phase methanol production from CO2 on Cu/ZnO catalysts in the presence of a hydrophobic solvent (e.g. hydrocarbon oil) based on the liquid–liquid separation [94]. Besides, recycling of unreacted gas to reactor can be essentially omitted as a result of high methanol yield (about 95%). In addition, various approaches like coating of methyl hydrogen silicone oil, hydrothermal treatment and addition of hydrophobic silica and graphite) have been developed to improve catalyst stability. The liquid-phase process has great potential; however, emphasis should be placed on catalyst development at moderate temperatures with respect to those in common gas-phase processes."
11,Reactor design and developments,"3.3 Reactor design and developments According to Table 2, in addition to reasonable design of catalysts with adequate efficiency, innovation in reactor design is of paramount significance in improving CO2 hydrogenation efficiency. A variety of designs have been investigated to obtain low outlet temperature, low catalyst volume, low by-product formation and heat recovery at high temperatures [413]. However, the key issue in reactor design for CO2 hydrogenation is removing the released heat of the exothermic reaction. Moreover, using a semi-batch autoclave reactor, Liu et al. [414] showed a methanol selectivity of 72.9% with CO2 conversion of about 25.9% at 170 °C and 5 MPa over copper catalyst. Presently, the reactors used for methanol production through CO2 hydrogenation are fundamentally similar to those utilized in methanol production by syngas. Three main reactors for customary methanol production are illustrated in Fig. 37 . In the Lurgi design (Fig. 37 (a)), the feed gas enters the tubes axially, and boiling water removes the heat of reaction. Haldor Topsøe and Matthey Davy technologies offered the same designs. The maximum capacity is about 1500 to 2200 t/d. Fig. 37 (b) demonstrates the Linde Variobar process, where the catalyst is loaded in the shell and boiling water circulates through the coil-wound heat exchanger. This design was reported to exhibit the highest catalyst per reactor volume ratio among all isothermal reactors. In addition, the high heat transfer coefficient of this reactor can reduce the heat transfer area due to its cross flow design. A multi-stage radial flow (MRF) reactor was developed by Toyo Engineering Corporation (TEC) and Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals (MTC). The main feature of this design is the radial gas flow across the shell, which is filled with catalyst and cooled by bayonet tubes (Fig. 37 (c)). A concentric cooling zone is formed via the tube arrangement. In addition, the pressure drop is very low (less than 0.5 bar), which facilitates scale-up. Fig. 37 (d) displays the superconverter designed by Mitsubishi Gas Chemicals and Mitsubishi Heavy industries. This reactor is assembled by the double-pipe tubes in a boiling water vessel, which combines the properties of a tube gas cooling reactor and a steam raising tubular reactor. the feed gas is preheated before entering the catalyst bed, which results in a high temperature (250 to 260 °C) at the tube inlet. In Fig. 37 (e) the Methanol Casale Isothermal Methanol Converter (IMC) is shown, where the feed gas, boiling water or their combination is used as coolant. The temperature of different parts can be controlled independently by the level of the cooling fluid, and the maximum reaction rate curve can be achieved accordingly. For high capacities (7000 to 10000 t/d) axial-radial flow is required to reduce the pressure drop, while for lower capacities (about 2000 t/d) the axial flow is preferred. For large capacities up to 10000 t/d, Haldor Topsøe developed multi-stage adiabatic fixed-bed reactors using internal cooling (Fig. 37 (f)). The dual stage or parallel reactors can also realize high capacity (5000 t/d) axial flow steam raising converters as illustrated in Fig. 37 (g), which is the Lurgi MegaMethanol converter. In the first reactor, which is a steam raising reactor, the feed gas is partially converted to methanol. Further conversion occurs in the tubular reactor, which is cooled by the feed gas. Accordingly, a small feed preheater is required. Air Products designed the Liquid Phase Methanol (LPMeOH) reactor (Fig. 37 (f)) for 235 t/d, which is a slurry bubble reactor. The catalyst particles are suspended in a mineral oil, which is inert and facilitates the heat transfer. An internal heat exchanger is used to remove the reaction heat, which provides approximately isothermal operation. However, the limited loading of catalyst results in a poor utilization of the reactor volume [415]. The tubular reactor (like the Lurgi and Haldor Tøpsoe) removes the heat released from the catalyst through boiling water. This type of reactor can quickly control reaction temperature while approaching the optimum reaction rate path. Almost isothermal nature of this reactor guarantees high CO2 conversion as well as catalyst stability, due to low operating temperature that can mitigate the sintering rate. However, mechanically complicated design imposes high investment costs and restricts the maximum size. In addition, the series spherical adiabatic reactors configured by Haldor Tøpsoe and Kellogg have benefits with respect to cylindrical reactors in lower pressure drop, lower reactor cost and higher methanol formation rate [416]. Furthermore, mitigating the impacts of thermal conflicts, recycle reactors yielded the highest CO2 conversion. In addition, Moioli et al. [417] concluded that the cascade reactor could be the best candidate for the production of methanol and methane. As mentioned above, the unfavorable equilibrium has been the main problem regarding methanol production. Bos et al. [418,419] proposed a two-temperature-zone concept for methanol production to shift the equilibrium. The first zone was the reactor (about 200 °C) and the second one was condenser (about 100 °C). However, further studies are required to optimize the dimensions of each zone and the required area for heat transfer. Ionic liquids were also proposed as another method to overcome equilibrium limitation via in-situ water sorption [420]. Moreover, on the laboratory scale, continuous flow stirred-tank reactors or slurry autoclave reactors are employed in the liquid phase CO2 hydrogenation, with solvents comprising DMF, squalane, water, 1,4-dioxane, n-hexadecane and etc. The developed catalysts comprise Cr, Zr and Th doped CuB [260], Cu/ZnO/Al2O3/ZrO2 micro-spherical catalysts, [421] colloidal ZnO/Cu [422–424], Cu/Mo2C, Pd/Mo2C [425], Pt/MoS2 [426], Co4N nanosheets [427], colloidal Pd2Ga [264], Pt3Co octapods [428], Pt–Co NWs [429], Rh75W25 nanosheets [430] and etc. The LPMeOH process with SBCR was discussed in Section 3.2. 3.3.1 Reactor innovations – membrane reactors In order to prevail the equilibrium limitation of the RWGS reaction, several approaches such as enhancing the overall reaction rate, improving methanol yield along with decreasing the recycle ratio of the unconverted gas, product removal through a selective membrane (using membrane reactor (MR)) was suggested [431–433]. In fact, using MR, results in continuous removal of water vapor from reactor, leading to enhanced methanol yield. Many researchers have focused on the utilization of MRs in methanol synthesis from either experimental or modeling point of view to circumvent this limitation. MRs exhibited higher yields than those obtained in traditional fixed-bed reactors under the same operating conditions [434,435]. Simulating methanol production from CO2 hydrogenation in a silicone rubber/ceramic composite MR coupling with experimental data, Chen et al. [436] demonstrated that CO2 conversion in MR increased by 22% with respect to that of fixed-bed reactor. Furthermore, several research groups have reported the improvement of methanol yield and selectivity in MRs using different membranes [437–439]. Nevertheless, all of the previous researchers have focused on the single reactors, while comparing three different reactor types in similar conditions proposed a dual-type MR, which could adjust reactor temperature and enhance the lifetime and activity of the catalyst [31]. Besides, using MRs resulted in overcoming the limitation of thermodynamic equilibrium along with enhancing kinetics-limited reactions [31]. High conversion per run, high heat transfer efficiency and excellent adaptability to CO2 at low operation costs were reported as other advantages of MRs [440-442]. Mechanical stability of various membranes like perfluorinated cation exchange materials (e.g. Li-Nafion membranes (DuPont) [443], Li-Nafion hollow fiber membranes [444]) and a water perm-selective ceramic membrane (silica/alumina composite membrane) reactor were explored. Improved CO2 conversion along with high methanol yield were reported employing a zeolite MR at different H2/CO2 feed ratios and temperatures compared to a conventional reactor [438,445]. Saeidi et al. [31] investigated CO2 hydrogenation to methanol and gas-to-liquid (GTL) process using three different reactor types, and showed that a dual-type membrane reactor with H2O and H2 perm-selective membranes reactors displayed considerable enhancement in the yield of methanol and gasoline production. However, the stability of membranes was not sufficient, and the optimal temperature and pressure of MR were generally lower than those of typical fixed-bed reactors. Using a H2O perm-selective membrane in the first reactor led to enhanced reactor performance with respect to conventional reactors. In addition, using H2O and H2 perm-selective membranes in first and second reactors, respectively, resulted in the maximum gasoline and methanol efficiency. Moreover, methanol synthesis suited better with this reactor configuration compared to the GTL process in terms of conversion [31]. The kinetic diameters of H2, CO2, CH3OH and H2O are 0.29, 0.33, 0.38 and 0.30 nm, respectively [446], which makes it difficult to obtain high permeation of H2O. Other challenging issues comprise the structural, chemical and thermal durability of the membrane at rather severe conditions (177–300 °C and 3–5 MPa) CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. Polymeric materials are frequently used for membrane fabrication, but they are not viable in severe reaction conditions [444,447]. Zeolite-based membranes were considered potential candidates in this regard, as a result of their chemical and thermal stability [93]. In addition, zeolites exhibit uniform, molecular-sized pores, high porosity, adsorption property and shape selectivity. A tubular membrane reactor with Nafion membranes for methanol production via CO2 hydrogenation over Cu/Zn was studied by Struis et al. [444,447]. The feed gas entered the inner shell of the membrane reactor, while an inert gas was introduced into the outer shell counter currently to sweep permeating components [93]. Higher CH3OH yield using MR was observed with respect to that without membrane at 200 °C and 0.43 MPa in the whole range of GHSV. However, inadequate stability of the polymeric membrane restricted its execution. Furthermore, preserving the structure while retaining the quality at rather higher pressures has been challenging. Van Tran et al. [448] showed that for a mixture of CO2, N2, H2, CH3OH, and H2O, the NaA membrane exhibited low permeability and thus high selectivity toward H2O and CH3OH compared to MFI membranes. However, using a NaA membrane resulted in higher methanol yield and selectivity at a wide range of operating conditions compared to conventional reactors, even at high pressures. Gallucci et al. showed that employing a zeolite MR led to higher CO2 conversion with respect to conventional reactors [439], while the improved performance could be kept at high pressure (2 MPa) Tavolaro et al. also reported enhanced CO2 conversion in a membrane reactor using hydrophilic LTA (Linde Type A) zeolite composite membrane [449]. At 210 °C, CO2 conversion in membrane reactor approached 17%, which exceeded the equilibrium value of about 6%. The MR was employed in the indirect methanol production path (RWGS + CO hydrogenation). The membrane-assisted CAMERE (methanol formation through RWGS reaction) process exhibited an analogous methanol synthesis rate with that of CAMERE process, showing 20% enhancement with respect to traditional reactors. In addition, the H2O formation rate was reduced by 38% with respect to the CAMERE process. A decrease in H2O formation rate was especially promising in extending catalyst lifetime. Recent studies have focused mainly on separating water-permanent mixtures at elevated pressures and temperatures [437,446,450]. This research has been extended to the separation of mixtures containing higher alcohols through MFI membranes [451]. The development of this area has been reported to be promising while providing economic profit, since higher alcohols syntheses are more favorable compared to methanol synthesis under the same conditions [49,452]. 3.3.2 Magnetic field-assisted reactor As a result of inadequate kinetic rates at low temperatures, CO2 conversion to methanol is associated with high energy consumption to preserve high activity, which is not environmentally sustainable [453,454]. In this regards, utilization of external magnetic field has been proposed as a potential approach to decrease the energy intake. The external magnetic field is beneficial to avoid magnetic particle agglomeration while eliminating channeling and slugging as well as decreasing the apparent activation energy [93]. External magnetic field was employed in the CO2 conversion to methanol over CuZnZr catalysts by Donphai et al. [455]. Different intensities of magnetic field (0 to 27.7 mT) as well as orientations (i.e., N-S and the reversed S–N) were studied. The reaction rate was enhanced via using a magnetic field particularly at higher temperatures (more than 200 °C). The optimal performance was achieved in the S-N orientation at magnetic intensity of 20.8 mT. Enhanced efficiency by utilization of magnetic field reduced the energy consumption, which provides potential to mitigate CO2 emissions [93]. This performance improvement can originate from CO2 adsorption along with a reduced activation barrier due to magnetic field. Similar results were obtained by the same group using the magnetic field for enhanced CO2 conversion in the presence of Cu-Fe/ZSM-5 [456]. The presence of a magnetic field resulted in the formation of methanol, DME and ethane while methane and CO were the main products in the absence of the magnetic field (Fig. 38 ). In addition, CO2 conversion and methanol selectivity were enhanced 1.7 and 2.24 times, respectively at about 220 °C. These conclusions confirmed the potential impact of magnetic field integration on thermocatalytic conversion of CO2. Future research should be mostly focused on developing knowledge about correlating surface chemistry and magnetic fields, which may provide leading principles to tailor the appropriate catalysts as well as optimizing the whole process."
12,Hydrocarbons synthesis,"The transformation of CO2 to light alkanes and alkenes comprises two indirect pathways: modified Fischer-Tropsch (MFT) process, and methanol-mediated route. In the MFT process, CO2 hydrogenation results in CO formation (RWGS) and further hydrogenation of CO (FT) leads in the formation of hydrocarbons [457]. However, in the second route, methanol is the product of CO2 hydrogenation, which is converted to hydrocarbons via further hydrogenation. Obviously, different active sites are required in each reaction pathway [458,459]. These products would be exploited as petrochemical building blocks or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). In the MFT pathway, the competition between CO2 and CO for H2 consumption should be considered as an important issue [460]. The reaction of CO/H2, CO2/H2 and (CO, CO2) mixture/H2 over Co-based catalysts was investigated by Zhang et al. [461] under typical FT conditions. CO2 hydrogenation is slow in the presence of CO. Almost identical catalytic activities, but different selectivities were achieved via feeding only CO2 or CO. In CO hydrogenation, product distribution was observed with α (chain growth) factor of around 0.80, whereas in CO2 hydrogenation about 70% of products were CH4. Consequently, hydrogenation of CO and CO2 undergo different reaction pathways. Moreover, they differ concerning catalyst stability since deactivation occurs slower using CO2 despite a larger ratio of H2O/H2 (minimum two times) compared to CO hydrogenation [21]. However, CO2 or CO hydrogenation resulted in the same hydrocarbon products in the presence of the Fe-Cu-K-Al2O3 catalyst [462]. Different behaviors of Co-and Fe-based catalysts were attributed to their different roles in methane formation along with product desorption, which is necessary for chain growth. Fe-based catalysts lead to irreversible carbide and alkali surface coverage, while Co-containing catalysts result in strong reversible adsorption of CO. γ-Al2O3 was the preferred support for Fe-based active site with K employed as a promoter [462]. Despite extensive application of Fe-based catalysts in CO2 hydrogenation, principal insight about the chemistry of the FeCO system and its consequences on rapid deactivation of the iron-based catalysts has yet to be developed. The multidisciplinary nature of the Fe-based catalysts results in a diverse range of chemical and physical deactivation [463]. The chemical deactivation of Fe-based catalysts results from the formation of spinel structure, which reduces the active sites. The deactivation of Fe–K/γ-Al2O3 in hydrocarbon production via CO2 hydrogenation was investigated by Lee et al. [464] through Mőssbauer spectroscopy, HR-TEM, XPS and TPO. As reaction proceeds, the active χ-Fe5C3 phase was formed due to the reduction of Fe2O3, which subsequently transformed to a non-active phase, θ-FeC3. In the reactor inlet, the deactivation was mostly due to the phase transformations, while at the outlet the main source of catalyst deactivation was attributed to sintering and coke deposition. Actually, active metal sintering and carbon deposition are the main reasons for physical deactivation, which can be restricted by the addition of steam as well as using a higher H2/CO2 ratio. In fact, hydrogen reaction with carbon deposits can avoid the catalyst deactivation. Besides, in order to reduce the metal sintering various methods such as using supports, promoters and/or modifying catalyst synthesis techniques have been used to increase the metal dispersion. For instance, it was observed that ZrO2 supported FeCo catalysts underwent severe metal sintering and consequently rapid deactivation, while polymetallic Fe-Co-Zr fibers, which were synthesized via one-step electrospinning methods, exhibited high stability [465]. The mentioned synthesis method resulted in separate dispersion of Fe and Co over the support, which mitigated the probability of metal sintering. Encapsulation of active metals in zeolites [466] or metal confinement in nanotubes [467] were also used to avoid metal sintering. It is noteworthy that, sintering was not considered as a main source of Fe-based catalyst deactivation [468,469]. Iron catalysts form iron carbide (Fe5C2) in-situ as the active phase during CO2 hydrogenation [470]. The lattice parameters of both cobalt and iron carbides are functions of feed composition [471] and are constant for CO/H2 while decreasing for CO2/H2. Moreover, the CO2/H2 reaction requires an initial reduction in contrast to CO/H2. Thus, effective catalysts for CO/H2 and CO2/H2 reactions differ during the process, even if starting from the same catalytic material. In general, Co-based catalysts form mostly methane, whereas better results are obtained by Fe-based catalysts, which are similar to those with syngas feed. CO2 hydrogenation to olefins under atmospheric pressure over 3D mesoporous Co3O4 was investigated by Gupta et. al. [472]. Superior activity of this catalyst was attributed to lower mass diffusion limitations, pore structure, and more active sites. Their high performance to cost ratio makes Co-containing catalysts favorable as going forward as strong candidates owing to their selectivity in FT synthesis. However, when changing the feed gas from CO/H2 to CO2/H2, Co favors methanation instead of FT catalysis [461,462,473,474]. In addition, mixed Fe-Co catalysts also show low selectivity towards hydrocarbons [471]. CO2 hydrogenation over Co/Al2O3 resulted in a product containing about 70 mol % methane [475]. CO and CO2 hydrogenation takes place through different routes; in the former primarily O–H and C–H were formed while in the latter O–H and H–C–O intermediates were formed. Accordingly, iron and γ-Al2O3 were recommended as active site and support, respectively while K was suggested as the promoter for CO2 hydrogenation, which proceeded via simultaneous RWGS and FT reactions [476–479]. Combining Fe-based catalysts and zeolites could maximize the production of iso-alkanes. Rongxian et al. [480] reported the production of iso-alkanes via CO2 hydrogenation on Fe-Zn-Zr/HY. Ni et al. [481] observed that the same catalysts can be used for the production of different products. Accordingly, iso-butane can be produced from propylene and methanol via the methanol to gasoline reaction while iso-pentane was formed through additive dimerization reactions of C2 and C3. Through methanol-mediated path, CO2 hydrogenation to methanol occurred on Cu–Zn-based catalysts following by methanol transformation to other hydrocarbons such as gasoline [482]. Despite extensive studies for developing composite catalysts, light alkanes constitute the major products as a result of additional hydrogenation of alkenes [483]. Generally, the Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) plots show the total hydrocarbon selectivity in both CO and CO2 hydrogenation [484]. The CO2 hydrogenation did not obey a regular ASF distribution and differed from what happened in CO hydrogenation [485]. In the CO2 hydrogenation process a low C/H ratio can be achieved as a result of high chemical and thermal CO2 stability, which leads to a slow adsorption rate of this molecule. This phenomenon leads to the hydrogenation of adsorbed intermediates, which results in methane formation and consequently reduced chain growth. Due to the significance of reaction mechanism (comprising both endo- and exothermic reactions along with catalyst deactivation) the effects of catalyst and reactor configuration on CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons are investigated based on the results presented in Table 3 ."
13,Effect of catalyst type on H2/CO2 to hydrocarbons,"4.1 Effect of catalyst type on H2/CO2 to hydrocarbons In this section, the influence of catalyst on hydrocarbons production is studied based on previous experimental results. In a fixed-bed reactor, a calculated equilibrium conversion of 72%, with experimental CO2 conversion levels between 46 to 53% was measured by Riedel et al. [477]. In general, reported conversion levels were in the range of 19% to 68%. [486–489]. These variations in CO2 conversion levels can be attributed to the different catalysts, operating conditions and reactors. Methane was the most thermodynamically favored HC [477], while a C2–C5+ alkene selectivity of around 80% was commonly reported [28,462,477,488]. 4.1.1 Modified Fischer-Tropsch (MFT) route For many years, iron oxides have been exploited as FT catalysts and were used in both WGS and RWGS reactions [490,491]. Fe-containing catalysts have gained much attention in hydrocarbon synthesis as a result of their high affinity towards olefins [465,492–496]. CO2 hydrogenation over iron catalyst has been revealed to proceed through a two-step process including the CO2 conversion to CO via the RWGS reaction followed by chain growth in FT reactions [477,497]. In the FT synthesis, it was assumed that either the iron's magnetite phase [498] or an amorphous oxide phase [499] is responsible for the RWGS activity, while the carbide phase (most likely the χ-Fe5C2) was found to be necessary for chain growth [500]. In addition, Fe3O4 and Fe5C2 should be in proper ratios for an efficient reaction [430,501]. Albrecht et al. [502] showed that bare Fe2O3 without dopant or other active sites synthesized via cellulose templates could offer high selectivity (about 37%) to C2-C4 hydrocarbons at 40% CO2 conversion. The method of catalyst preparation affected the redox properties of iron oxide. Geng et al. [503] proposed a reaction scheme over the active sites (Fig. 39 ) where paths 1 and 3 show the RWGS and FT reactions. Since the RWGS reaction is reversible (path 2), reducing the water content via water removal (path 4) was suggested to enhance hydrocarbon formation. In addition, further adsorption and reaction of products can result in chain propagation (path 5). Ethane re-adsorbed on the catalyst and for chain growth in FTS, lower concentrations of C2-products were observed [504–506]. This phenomenon did not occur in the ASF plots of the CO2 hydrogenation process, owing high C2-product concentrations [477]. It was concluded that supported Fe catalysts exhibited high selectivity towards hydrocarbons (about 11%), while CO2 conversion was quite low (about 16%). However, addition of another metal such as Co, Cu or Ni to Fe could improve CO2 conversion [507]. It was speculated that combining Fe with another metal could probably modify the catalyst adsorption properties. In addition, it was concluded that controlling the reactant (H2 and CO2) coverage over the metals influenced the formation of CC bond for hydrocarbon production. It was reported that, the hydrocarbon selectivity of bimetallic alumina supported Fe-Co catalysts was about 4 times higher than that of monometallic Fe [508]. Moreover, it was reported that the Fe-Cu bimetallic catalyst exhibited higher selectivity towards C2-C7 hydrocarbons compared to that of monometallic Fe catalyst, while lower undesired CH4 was formed [509]. Fe-based catalysts dispersed on various supports have been investigated extensively and have shown considerable effects on product distribution as presented in Table 3. Supports are used as a stabilizer to hinder sintering or Ostwald ripening of the catalyst's active sites during the process. Al2O3 has been extensively utilized as a catalyst support due to exhibiting high surface area, strengthening the mechanical properties of active catalyst while suppressing active phase agglomeration [510,511]. Ding et al. [512] investigated the effect of hydroxyl distribution on the acid-base properties of the Al2O3 and its consequences in hydrocarbon production through CO2 hydrogenation. More hydroxyl groups on the support surface resulted in a smaller size of iron carbides that exhibited higher CO2 conversion (54.4%) along with higher hydrocarbon (C5+) selectivity (31.1%). In addition, a SiO2 coating (9 wt%) increased Fe-K/Al2O3 performance in terms of both CO2 conversion and C2 + hydrocarbon selectivity to 63% and 74%, respectively. This is probably due to increased catalyst hydrophobicity, which hampered the detrimental impact of water on the catalyst [513]. γ-Al2O3 showed the best performance followed by SiO2 and TiO2 when employed as supports [496,514,515]. γ-Al2O3 can hinder sintering due to strong metal-support interactions resulting in well-dispersed catalyst particles [516]. Moreover, the improved performance of γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts can be ascribed to the catalytically active catalyst-support phase [517], according to which the improved catalyst performance as well as the significant difference in the promoting effect of K among other alkali metals can be explained. When both γ-Al2O3 and K were used as parts of the catalyst, the potassium alanate (KAlH4) phase appropriate for reversible H2 sorption at moderate temperatures (250–300 °C) was formed [518]. The presence of KAlH4 would reduce the hydrogenation of surface carbonaceous species and thus act as an H2-reservoir that would result in increased alkene formation, and decreased selectivity toward methane [486]. Sodium alanate (NaAlH4) is recognized for H2 activation at much lower temperatures (around 150 °C) with respect to KAlH4 [518], which limits its application at the temperatures required for FT reactors. It was revealed that Mo2C can be used as both Co-catalyst and support in CO2 hydrogenation at low temperatures (135 to 200 °C) in liquid 1,4-dioxane solvent. It was observed that methanol with about 95% selectivity was the most favorable product at 135 °C while as temperature increased selectivity towards ethanol (about 15%) and hydrocarbons (about 5 to 10%) were enhanced. In addition, introduction of Pd and Cu improved methanol formation while Fe and Co incorporation resulted in ethanol and hydrocarbon production as can be observed in Fig. 40 [425]. The difference in catalytic activity (about two-fold) of the Na and K promoted iron-based catalysts [486] cannot be attributed only to the basicity of the alkali oxides since this amounts to about 18% [519]. Chemisorption experiments showed that increased CO2 and decreased H2 adsorption [462,496] was observed for K-promoted Fe–Al catalysts in accordance with the CO2 hydrogenation mechanism according to the surface basicity theory [464]. Nevertheless, since chemisorption experiments were performed at room temperature, no conclusions can be construed about the alanate phase at FT conditions. It also implies that both K and Al are required to exist as the parts of an efficient CO2 hydrogenation catalyst at temperatures about 300 °C. Xie et al. [520] showed that an appropriate pore size of Al2O3 support was about 7-10 nm, which could result in 5-8 nm iron oxides with potential activity in chain growth reactions. In a recent study, Wu et al. [521] showed that honeycomb structured graphene (HSG) could act as an appropriate support for Fe-K catalyst in CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons. HSG could confine the iron carbide size at high temperatures and avoid sintering of active sites. Moreover, comparing HSG with other supports such as TiO2, ZrO2, Al2O3 and SiO2 under 340 °C and 20 bar showed that FeK1.5/HSG displayed the best performance with FTY= (Fe time yield to light olefins) of 19 μ m o l C O 2 g F e − 1 s − 1 and CO2 conversion of 46%. Li et al. [522] found that the support crystal phase can have a decisive role on the CO2 hydrogenation performance of TiO2-supported Co catalysts. Rutile TiO2 was selective towards CH4 formation while the anatase phase showed high selectivity to CO as depicted in Fig. 41 . Moreover, Zr-Co/anatase TiO2 was capable of the production of CH4 and C2-C4 hydrocarbons (at a selectivity of 17%) due to a higher C/H ratio on the catalyst surface, while over Zr-Co/rutile TiO2 only CH4 can be produced. The C/H ratio of the catalyst surface was higher for the anatase phase in the presence of promoters and higher hydrocarbons (C5+) are formed over K-Zr-Co/ anatase TiO2 catalyst along with an about 70% CO2 conversion. Rodemerck et al. [523] showed that using TiO2 as a support is required to reduce methane selectivity in K-promoted Fe-based catalysts. Owen et al. [524] also reported that Co-Na-Mo supported on TiO2 gives the highest selectivity towards C2-C4 olefins as compared to catalysts supported on Al2O3, CeO2 and ZrO2 and MgO oxides. However, SiO2 and ZSM-5 supports lead to higher conversion of CO2 while MgO-supported catalysts have both low CO2 activity and hydrocarbon selectivity. Metal-support interactions and particle sizes of Co impose a significant effect on the catalyst activity, and weak interactions between metal and support result in the production of short-chain hydrocarbons and vice versa [524]. Jiang et al. [525] proposed bifunctional catalysts including Fe3O4 sites active for RWGS and Co or Fe5C2 responsible for FT reactions. The Co-impregnated (Fig. 42 (a)), powder mixing (Fig. 42 (b)), particle mixing (Fig. 42 (c)) and separate loading of 15Fe5K/SiC and 8Co/SiC catalysts (Fig. 42 (d)) were investigated to assess the effect of Co and Fe intimacy on the product distribution. It was demonstrated that, higher intimacy between Fe and Co resulted in the production of more C2+ hydrocarbons due to easy CO spillover from iron oxide to Co. Whereas, long distances between the above-mentioned active sites led to the formation of CH4 as a result of low CO concentration on Co. Accordingly, Co-impregnated 15Fe5K8Co/SiC exhibited the highest selectivity towards light hydrocarbons while separate loading of 15Fe5K/SiC and 8Co/SiC in two reactors resulted in the highest methane selectivity. These results show the significance of reactor configuration in addition to catalyst formulation [525]. Co incorporation strengthened CO2 adsorption while promoting iron carburization to carbide species, which favored chain propagation [526,527]. Gnanamani et al. [528] demonstrated that Co-Fe (50:50) catalysts showed higher hydrocarbon selectivity (20-25%) as compared to monometallic Fe or Co catalysts while methane selectivity was about 50-60%. Numpilani et al. [529] investigated the effect of calcination temperature on the performance of Fe-Co/K-Al2O3. As calcination temperature increased (above 500 °C) the olefin/paraffin ratio increased while methane production was suppressed as a result of reducing the hydrogenation strength of the catalyst via KAlO2 formation, which reduced surface hydrogen via KAlH4 formation. In addition, higher calcination temperatures increased the interaction between iron and other metal oxide species, which in turn reduced the hydrogenation ability of the catalyst. Xu et al. [530] demonstrated that different metals could result in different products based on their reduction potential. In this regard, Mo2C supported Co2+, Ni2+ and Cu2+ showed selectivity towards hydrocarbons, methane and methanol, respectively (Fig. 43 ). Indeed, Co/Mo2C was found to be active in hydrocarbon production. Xie et al. [531] showed that the Co/SiO2 phase in the CeO2-Pt@mSiO2-Co catalyst resulted in high selectivity (about 60%) towards C2-C4 hydrocarbons at 250 °C. Owen et al. [532] also showed that substitution of Pd with Pt decreased CH4 selectivity while increasing C5+ production. Nie et al. [533] showed that bimetallic Fe-Cu catalysts could enhance CO2 hydrogenation selectivity towards C2H4 while Fe could only result in CH4 formation. Using DFT calculations, the C H 2 * hydrogenation barrier was higher than that of C-C formation via coupling of two CH* on the bimetallic Fe-Cu catalyst, which subsequently suppressed CH4 formation. Indeed C2H6 could be also produced via further hydrogenation of C2H4. Fig. 44 demonstrates the pathways and energy barriers over both mono- and bimetallic surfaces. The amount of surface Cu played an important role in determining the reaction path and in the presence of Cu/(Fe+Cu)=4/9 the formate pathway was favorable with respect to the carboxyl route [534]. The addition of Cu to Fe-based catalysts increases iron reducibility via providing appropriate sites for hydrogen dissociation that can reduce Fe at low temperatures [486]. Wang et al. [535] showed that CO2 hydrogenation to alkanes was possible at 180 °C in the presence of [BMIm][PF6]. As depicted in Fig. 45 CO2 decomposed over Pd* to produce Pd*CO, which could be transferred to HPd*CHO through hydrogenation. Further reaction with hydrogen and Cl− led to the formation of CH3Pd*Cl. The final hydrogenation product was CH3CH3 while propane and n-butane production were also possible. Qadir et al. [536] showed that Ru/Ni in ionic liquids were capable of CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons (mostly alkanes) at low temperatures (150 °C). Recently, Chen et al. [537] proposed carbon-confined MgH2 nano-lamellae as active catalysts in CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons with low H2/CO2 ratios (1/4 or 1/8). Solid hydrogen in both H− and H+ was responsible for CO2 activation. According to Fig. 46 , H− interacted with carbon sites of CO2 while H+ reacted with the oxygen sites and led to Mg-formate formation. Lattice hydrogen might be used for hydrogenation of formate species to light olefins while gas-phase hydrogen replenished that consumed from the framework. In addition, higher concentration of gaseous H2 might lead to further hydrogenation of olefins to paraffins. Selectivity of 50.9% and 49.1% to C2 =-C4 = and C1- C3 could be achieved at 10.5% CO2 conversion when H2/CO2 =1/8, T=320 °C and P=1 MPa. Lan et al. [538] investigated CO2 hydrogenation of metal/ZSM-5 catalysts in a DBD plasma reactor. Hydrocarbons were not produced when Cu was used and Fe and Mo could show CH4 selectivity when supported on ZSM-5. However, C2-C4 hydrocarbons could be produced in the presence of Co/ZSM-5. The plasma acted as an initiator for CO2 and H2 decomposition (Fig. 47 ) while the catalyst promoted hydrocarbon formation at temperatures lower than 200 °C. 4.1.2 Methanol-mediated route Hydrocarbons can be produced via methanol-mediated route, where a hybrid catalyst comprising methanol-selective catalyst and zeolite is used. Generally, the first catalyst is responsible for methanol production while the zeolite offers appropriate acid sites for methanol conversion to hydrocarbons [539,540]. Liu et al. [541] suggested that -M-O- (M=Ga, Zn) sites on ZnGa2O4/SAPO-34 were active in providing atomic hydrogen for CO2 transformation to formate and subsequently methoxide species, which led to methanol production via further hydrogenation according to Fig. 48 . The Ga/Zn ratio could affect the amount of oxygen vacancies, which was reported to be of paramount significance for CO2 activation to methanol [541]. Xu et al. [542] proposed that in the presence of Na-Fe-HZSM-5, the pore structure of zeolite as a key component was responsible for further reactions of light olefins such as isomerization, hydrogenation, cyclization and cracking. However, excessive HZSM-5 loading could result in the production of more heavy aromatics via polycondensation and alkylation reactions. Similar results were reported by Wei et al. [543] in the presence of physically mixed Na-Fe3O4 and zeolite for the production of gasoline-range chemicals as illustrated in Fig. 49 . Wang et al. [544] showed that bifunctional Cr2O3-HZSM-5 was active in CO2 hydrogenation to aromatics with 76% selectivity through a methanol-mediated route. In addition, silica treated catalysts could inhibit further p-xylene isomerization via modifying acid sites of the zeolite surface. Moreover, Li et al. [545] proved that dispersing ZnZrO nanoparticles on the H-ZSM-5 surface could result in the formation of aromatics. It was found that CHxO species were produced via CO2 hydrogenation over ZnZrO catalysts while aromatics formation occurred in the presence of H-ZSM-5 (Fig. 50 ). The most advantageous feature of these bifunctional metal/zeolite catalysts is their potential in tuning product selectivity towards olefins or aromatics via selecting appropriate metal sites and zeolites [546]. Recently, Zhang et al. [547] reported 70% selectivity towards aromatics on ZnO/ZrO2-ZSM-5 tandem catalyst. CO2 was transformed into methanol over ZnO/ZrO2, which was further converted to higher alkenes on ZSM-5. Meanwhile, aromatics were formed from higher alkenes due to appropriate acid sites of the ZSM-5 that favored cyclization reactions as illustrated in Fig. 51 . Cui et al. [548] also reported that a spinel of the composition ZnFeOx-nNa/HZSM-5 was capable of aromatics production at 320 °C (75.6% selectivity) (Fig. 52 ) as a result of the Brønsted acidity provided by HZSM-5 . Accordingly, a 41.2% CO2 conversion was achieved while CH4 and CO selectivity were less than 20%. Ni et al. [549] showed that composites of nano-spinel ZnAlOx and HZSM-5 were capable of aromatics production with about 73.9% selectivity and 9.1% CO2 conversion at 320 °C and 3 MPa. In fact, Zn2+ was responsible for CO2 activation while zeolite Brønsted acid sites were beneficial in the aromatization of methanol and olefins to p-xylene. As a whole, it can be speculated that HZSM-5 is capable of cycloaddition reactions as depicted in Fig. 53 to produce paraffins and aromatics from FT products [550]. Wei et al. [551] showed that Na-Fe3O4/HMCM-22 was capable of C4 + isoparaffin production with about 74% selectivity towards C4-C11 saturated hydrocarbons at 26% CO2 conversion. Comparing HBeta, HMCM-22 and HZSM-5 as supports, it was revealed that isoparaffin selectivity of Na-Fe3O4/HBeta and Na-Fe3O4/HMCM-22 were 59% and 57%, respectively while that of Na-Fe3O4/HZSM-5 reached 34%. These results are attributed to the zeolite structure and strength of Brønsted acid sites. Large mesopore volume along with low acidity of HMCM-22 favored isomerization reactions while suppressing aromatization. Following CO2 activation and olefins formation over Fe3O4 and Fe5C2, isomerization and aromatization of olefins occurred on the acid sites of the zeolite as depicted in Fig. 54 . Tan et al. [552] assessed the performance of In2O3/ZrO2 and In2O3/ZrO2-SAPO-34 in CO2 hydrogenation. The former catalyst was capable of methanol production while the latter was found to be active in olefins production with methanol as the intermediate product (Fig. 55 ). Due to the presence of In3+ and Zr4+ Lewis acids along with Zr/In-OH Brønsted acids, CO2 adsorbed in the form of HCOO-Zr/In, which is transferred to methanol. Simultaneously, the produced methanol is converted to light olefins in the channels of SAPO-34. Li et al. [553] demonstrated that ZnZrO/SAPO-34 can considerably enhance lower olefins production (about 80% selectivity at 12.6% CO2 conversion) through CO2 hydrogenation to CHxO over ZnZrO and subsequent olefins formation on SAPO-34 as illustrated in Fig. 56 . Wang et al. [554] showed that olefins production through methanol was dependent on the Brønsted acid sites of SAPO-34. However, the sites on ZnO-ZrO2 oxide in both studies were Lewis acids appropriate for CO2 conversion. In fact, the synergy between these sites resulted in the tuned electronic properties of the composite catalyst. The physicochemical properties of In2O3-ZnZrOx/SAPO-34 thus plays an important role in tuning product distribution [292,295]. Moreover, the small crystal size shortens the methanol diffusion path from the catalyst surface to the SAPO-34 acid sites. In addition, nitric acid treatment reduces Brønsted acid sites and consequently increases the selectivity towards C2 =-C4 = hydrocarbons [295]. It was reported that the product distribution was affected by the composition of the metallic oxide. ZnO-Y2O3/SAPO-34 showed 83.9% selectivity to light olefins at 27.6% CO2 conversion [555]. Chen et al. [556] demonstrated that core-shell CuZnZr@(Zn-)SAPO-34 are also selective towards light hydrocarbons via a methanol-mediated path as a result of a shortened contact interface. In fact, this could avoid further hydrogenation of light olefins to C3-C4 hydrocarbons. In addition, the SAPO-34 acidity was reduced via Zn-treatment, which in turn slowed down the reactivity of light olefins and led to 72% selectivity towards light olefins at 400 °C and 2 MPa. Furthermore, high olefins selectivity in the presence of Fe2O3@KO2/ZrS/SAPO-34 was attributed to the acidity of coated sulfated zirconia (ZrS) layers, which was boosted in the presence of water and was able to crack C5+ species to light olefins. Accordingly, at 49% CO2 conversion, selectivity towards light hydrocarbon was reported to be 48% at 375 °C and 30 bar, which was higher than other zeolite-supported catalysts [557]. Recently, Hu et al. [558] reported the utilization of MOFs, like ZIF-8 and MIL-53 as the supports for Fe catalysts in CO2 hydrogenation. These hydrothermally stable supports were mainly selective towards alkane production both directly (MIL-53) and through secondary reactions (ZIF-8). In addition, they reported higher CO2 conversion compared to that of Al2O3-supported Fe due to stronger CO2 adsorption. 4.1.3 Promoter role Promoters are often incorporated into catalysts to raise the yield of the desired hydrocarbons. Although iron catalysts were found capable of converting CO2 with a much higher affinity towards alkenes and long-chain HCs with respect to Co catalysts, undoped iron catalysts showed high selectivity to undesired products. Therefore, promoters were employed to tailor and optimize product distribution [559–562]. Promoters can alter either electronic or/and structural catalyst properties. Structural promoters can influence the formation and stabilization of the active phase, resulting in high catalyst dispersion on the support and subsequently lead to higher conversion rates [563,564]. However, electronic promoters may change electron density close to the catalyst valence band, mutating local electron density near the surface and consequently modifying the active sites. Electronic promoters can increase conversion levels as well as altering product distribution [565,566]. Generally, binders are not catalytically inactive or chemically inert, especially at high temperatures. Therefore, binder–catalyst interactions can strongly influence the catalyst selectivity and activity, which is mainly due to the changes in catalyst acidity [567]. However, the promoter played the most significant role in perturbing the active site to enhance CO2 conversion, while the remaining parameters such as binder, and support could slightly improve the product selectivity. Manganese (Mn) has been reported to act as both structural and electronic promoters on iron-based catalysts. Suppression of methane formation and increasing the alkene/alkane ratio in both FT and CO2 hydrogenation [28,488] were reported as the results of Mn addition to iron-containing catalysts [568]. Mn promoted catalyst reduction along with dispersion and carburization of precursor Fe2O3-state markedly increase the basicity of the catalyst surface [569], possibly due to incorporation in iron's lattice [486]. It is worth mentioning that over-doping of iron-based catalysts had a negative effect by blocking the active sites, which resulted in the production of unwanted species and reduced the CO conversion [255,517,569]. Liang et al. [570] showed that Mn addition to Na/Fe could enhance olefins production, since Mn-Fe interaction could inhibit chain growth via reducing the strength of CO adsorption over 5Mn-Na/Fe catalyst. Mn can often be replaced by copper (Cu) as promoter in iron-based catalysts due to its similar performance to Mn and its capability to significantly enhance the CO2 hydrogenation ability. In addition to acting as a RWGS catalyst [571], Cu was indicated to increase the reduction of hematite particles within the carburization process along with growing the dispersion of catalyst particles [572]. In its metallic form, Cu can provide active sites for H2 dissociative adsorption [486]. Liu et al. [573] showed that the addition of Cu promoters led to more alkane production via alkene secondary hydrogenation reactions. Potassium (K) addition as a promoter had the most effect on the performance of the catalyst. The critical role of K, in FT and MFT reactions, has not clearly understood yet, and among other alkaline promoters K could cause the largest conundrum [486,574]. In the FT reaction, K acted as an electronic promoter rather than a structural one. K is a donor of an additional electron density for the catalyst active sites that favor the π-bond formation so enhance the CO dissociative adsorption and decrease the H2 adsorption [575–577], which decreased alkene hydrogenation [578,579]. In CO2 hydrogenation, larger amounts of K were found to be beneficial in contrast to FT reactions that could be poisonous for iron-based catalysts [477,517]. K addition increased CO2 conversion while decreasing methane production [580,581]. Moreover, the alkene/alkane ratio increased and longer chain HCs were enhanced [517,582]. The ASF distribution for K-Mn-Fe catalysts in CO2 hydrogenation showed a high chain growth probability that was only slightly lower than that in FT reactions [462,517,583]. Guo et al. [584] showed that Fe/Co-Yk, where Y was K+-exchanged zeolites, was selective towards heavy linear hydrocarbons. A CO2 conversion of 25.9% and CH4 selectivity of 13.9% were obtained along with a 70.9% and 45.9% selectivity towards C2-C3 = and C4-C15 =. Ramirez et al. [585] reported an outstanding performance of K2CO3 encapsulated Fe2O3 in CO2 hydrogenation to light olefins. A tandem mechanism (as depicted in Fig. 57 ) comprising CO2 activation on K2CO3 and subsequent hydrocarbon formation via FT synthesis was proposed. Accordingly, high K loading was responsible for CO formation through the RWGS reaction while the amounts of iron oxide as well as iron carbide were found to be responsible for determining the olefin/paraffin ratio. In another study, Ramirez et al. [586] showed that olefins (over ZSM-5) and aromatics (over MOR) could be directly produced via CO2 hydrogenation over Fe2O3@KO2/zeolite at 375 °C and 30 bar. According to Fig. 58 , unsupported Fe2O3@KO2 catalysts were responsible for CO2 to CO transformation while CO could be either transferred to hydrocarbons over Fe or form surface-methoxy species (SMS) in the presence of MOR or ZSM-5. In addition, olefins aromatization could occur over ZSM-5. At First, CO produced via RWGS reaction over Fe2O3@KO2 (Fig. 58 a). In the next step, FT reaction occurred in the presence of Fe nanoparticles to form hydrocarbons. The remaining part of CO diffused to the ZSM-5 and MOR pores and hydrogenated to SMS. Ethylene was the main product of SMS transformation. (Fig. 58 b). The pathway of olefins formation via carbonylated intermediates of surface has been shown to be via forming the ketone-based intermediates in both MFT and methanol-mediated routes. In the last step, the produced olefins took part in aromatization reactions as depicted in Fig. 58 c. Wang et al. [509] showed a promoting effect of K in prohibiting CH4 formation and enhancing the olefins selectivity of Fe-Cu/γ-Al2O3. Accordingly, C2-C4 selectivity increased from 53% in Fe-Cu(0.17) to 76% Fe-Cu(0.17)K(1.0) at 300 °C and 1.1 MPa. Generally, the addition of alkali metals can hinder CH4 selectivity while enhancing hydrocarbon selectivity through modifying C/H ratios on the catalyst surface [522]. Satthawong et al. [527,587] also displayed the addition of K to Fe-Co/Al2O3 catalysts reduced weakly bonded hydrogen and inhibited olefins hydrogenation. Moreover, the introduction of K to Fe-M/TiO2 (M=Co, Cu) catalysts reduced CH4 production while enhancing hydrocarbon selectivity. However, further K addition (K/Fe > 0.3) led to higher CO production and reduced hydrocarbon selectivity. In addition, La incorporation could significantly improve C5+ hydrocarbons selectivity via CO consumption in FT reactions [507]. Recently, the incorporation of bio-based potassium could considerably increase the light olefins (C2-C3) selectivity (72%) at 31% CO2 conversion as depicted in Fig. 59 . Biopromoters could raise the amount of carbides and consequently increase the C-C coupling activity. Indeed, chemical potassium promoters can decrease hydrogenation of alkenes, but their potential in C-C coupling is hindered due to lower carbide content [588]. Ceria (Ce) is a well-known WGS catalyst and also considered as an ideal promoter for iron-based catalysts. It has been indicated that Ce-promoted Fe catalysts showed less chain growth ability than unpromoted iron catalysts but resulted in a larger percentage of CO [589,590]. Considering the reaction mechanism and based on the product composition Ce deactivated the catalyst via blocking its active sites. To test this assumption, supported catalysts were examined by the research group of Pérez-Alonso with better Ce dispersion in favor of the iron/manganese particles. However, similar results to those of unsupported catalysts were obtained and Ce deposition on the particles’ surface blocked the catalyst's active sites for chain growth [591]. Zirconia (Zr) enhanced CO2 hydrogenation capability of Fe-based catalysts via modification of basicity, reducibility and atomic composition of the catalyst surface [592,593]. The addition of ZrO2 to K/Fe-Zn-Cu-O resulted in higher CO2 adsorption and reduced methane production while increasing hydrocarbon selectivity [593]. The interaction between Fe and Zr could result in C2-C4 hydrocarbons selectivity of about 54% on incorporation into silica-iron oxide catalysts [594]. Samanta et al. [595] demonstrated that electronic interactions between the carbide phase and zirconia improved the activity of Fe-Al-O spinel phase in RWGS and FT reactions. Both zirconia and lattice oxygens compete in accepting electrons from iron ions, which increased the positive charge of iron and consequently enhanced CO2 hydrogenation activity according to Fig. 60 . Accordingly, the carbonyl oxygen resulted from CO adsorption interacting with promoter, which could weaken C=O and led to the formation of CHx. Isomerization of these CHx species resulted in hydrocarbons production [595]. Ding et al. [596] showed that Fe0.3Co0.15Zr0.45K0.1O1.63 could convert CO2 to light olefins with 63.5% selectivity at 310 °C and 2 MPa. The catalyst was able to maintain 55% CO2 conversion and 62% light olefin selectivity after 200 h reaction. Oxygen vacancies were responsible for CO2 dissociation while suppressing CH4 formation and increasing C2H4 selectivity. Dang et al. [294] indicated that the catalytic performance of bifunctional Zr-In catalysts considerably affected by zirconium, since more oxygen vacancies could be created in the presence of a certain amount of Zr. This phenomenon suppressed sintering and improved hydrocarbon selectivity (65-80% C2 =-C4 = and 13-30 % C2-C4) while reducing methane production (about 2.5%) at a CO2 conversion of 15-27% at 380 °C. Other promoters like Zn have been also reported to enhance C2-C4 hydrocarbon selectivity and CO2 conversion while suppressing C5+ production through improving the basicity of Zn promoted Fe catalysts [597]. Sodium (Na) was also reported as an active promoter in combination with the thermal treatment of Co@C catalysts for the C2+ hydrocarbons production. Sunlight irradiation improved hydrocarbon selectivity while ethanol formation was also favored due to CO stabilization (Fig. 61 ). UV light supplies electrons responsible for the formation of CO2 δ−. In addition, in the presence of non-promoted catalysts CH4 was the sole product of CO2 hydrogenation [598]."
14,Effect of operating conditions on H2/CO2 to hydrocarbons,"4.2 Effect of operating conditions on H2/CO2 to hydrocarbons In this section the effect of operating conditions is inspected based on the previous experimental studies that are demonstrated in Table 3. The effect of operating conditions has been studied in terms of space velocity, temperature, and pressure in the following sections. 4.2.1 Effect of space velocity Low space velocity (SV), high residence time, led to increased CO2 conversion accompanied by enhanced HCs yield and the formation of huge amounts of H2O [599]. The preference for oxide formation at low SV can be partially attributed to the oxidation of metallic iron by H2O. Comparing the CO2 conversion in single, recycle and series reactors based on SV, showed that the recycle reactor with SV=2000 ml/grcat h exhibited the best performance with respect to conversion and selectivity followed by the series reactors with SV = 1000, and the single reactor with SV = 1000. SV was considered as the main tool to increase conversion [600]. Willauer et al. [601] reported that both CO and CO2 conversion could be increased via lowering GHSV, while not influencing the chain growth probability. However, a very low GHSV was considered to be impractical since high amounts of catalyst are required to achieve the desired conversion [601]. Visconti et al. [602] demonstrated that the conversion of CO2 and H2 decreased while the CO selectivity raised by increasing GHSV. In addition, product distribution and olefin/paraffin ratio were not affected by GHSV, which was an indication of hampered olefin hydrogenation reactions in the presence of potassium [602]. 4.2.2 Pressure effect Besides reducing SV, elevated pressure led to a shift of the product distribution considerably towards long-chain HCs [603]. Since the RWGS reaction is reversible, elevation of pressure doesn't affect the CO2 conversion unless the produced CO via the RWGS reaction is consumed subsequently through the FT reaction and thus taken out of equilibrium. However, H2O would be produced that inevitably obstructs the RWGS reaction and hence the CO production. Meanwhile, the high CO2 conversion, especially at improved HCs yield, at high pressure, may lead to significantly high H2O partial pressure in the catalyst bed [604]. Thus, it is crucial to remove H2O in order to avoid shifting the equilibrium towards the WGS reaction as well as hindering catalyst deactivation [605]. Pressure increase (1 to 15 bar) resulted in higher CO2 conversion and lower selectivity towards CO and hydrocarbons along with higher selectivity towards CH4 [606]. Modeling studies showed that hydrocarbon selectivity was not affected by pressure rise however, the amount of light olefins increased at extremely high pressures. In addition, the yields of heavier hydrocarbons (C4H8 and C4H10) decreased considerably when the pressure reached 10 MPa [607]. According to the results of Visconti et al. [602] C2-C4 olefins were the dominant products at 5-10 barg (0.5-1 MPa) in the presence of bulk Fe-catalyst promoted by K. However, over Co-Pt/Al2O3 catalysts pressure reduction (450 to 150 psi) led to enhanced light olefins production and lower CH4 production [473]. 4.2.3 Temperature effect CO2 conversion and CO yield increase slowly with temperature increase through the RWGS reaction (reversible endothermic). In contrast, the exothermic FT reaction proceeds faster at high-temperature conditions. Thus, finding a system to avoid this thermal conflict between these reactions occurring simultaneously in a reactor appears to be critical [608]. Moreover, the dependence of HCs yield on temperature is not unequivocal due to a larger tendency of catalyst deactivation as a result of inert carbon deposition. Temperature plays an important role in shifting equilibrium and reaction rates [609]. In addition, at temperatures above 325 °C, hydrocarbon yields were almost independent of pressure and SV while at lower temperatures (about 300 °C) SV reduction and pressure rise had positive effects on the total hydrocarbon yield [607]. However, the C-C chain cracking is serious at high temperatures, proceeding to the Sabatier reaction. The improvement of carburization can lead to a higher olefin/paraffin ratio at higher temperatures due to the improved H-elimination in the C-C chain termination on a carbon-rich surface. This leads to the occurrence of the Boudouard reaction (R18) [610,611], which necessitates the adjustment of H2 concentration. (R18) C O + C O → C ( S ) + C O 2 Δ H 573 K = 173.5 k J / m o l Above 240 °C the curvature of the Arrhenius plot changed, which can be attributed to the deactivation of the Co/SiO2 catalyst; however, hydrocarbon selectivity increased up to 270 °C [606]. Investigating the temperature effect on the performance of Fe5C2-10K/Al2O3 showed that temperature reduction from 400 to 320 °C reduced CO2 conversion and CO selectivity while olefin selectivity decreased. Temperatures about 320 °C could be more appropriate to obtain high selectivity towards C2-C4 olefins and C5+ hydrocarbons [612]. Owen et al. [613] demonstrated that low temperatures (about 230 °C) favored CH4 formation while increasing the temperature to approximately 330 °C resulted in the production of long-chain hydrocarbons over Fe/SiO2."
15,Effect of reactor configuration,"4.3 Effect of reactor configuration As mentioned before, endothermic RWGS and exothermic FT reactions can be favorably integrated in a single reactor to enhance energy efficiency. Fixed-bed reactors have been used extensively to produce hydrocarbons from CO2 hydrogenation [586,603]. However, considering the potential limitations of the fixed-bed reactor such as temperature control and hot spots, slurry and fluidized-bed reactors have been exploited to enhance the performance of CO2 hydrogenation to HCs since they showed beneficial results for removing the generated heat of this highly exothermic process as shown in Fig. 62 [489]. In fact, CO2 hydrogenation to HCs in slurry and fluidized-bed reactors over Fe–Cu–K–Al catalyst resulted in superior catalytic performance in comparison with a fixed-bed reactor. The space time yields were reported to be 41.8, 35.2 and 31.8 for fluidized-bed, slurry and fixed-bed reactors, respectively [489]. Moreover, heavy HCs and light olefins can be produced in slurry and fluidized-bed reactors as illustrated in Fig. 63 [489,614,615]. Products of high boiling points and saturated hydrocarbons are usually produced in slurry reactors while, fluidized-bed reactors are better for production of unsaturated hydrocarbons. For instance, olefin selectivity at 300 °C, was ∼86.7% which was higher than those of fixed-bed (75.9%) and slurry (72.9%) reactors. In addition the selectivity towards heavy hydrocarbons (≥ C5) were in the order of slurry (72.9%) > fluidized-bed (55.6%) > fixed-bed (53.9%) [489]. Coupling reactors into a series has been proposed as a means to increase both CO2 conversion and selectivity towards heavy hydrocarbons (> C5). Lee et al. [567] demonstrated that using a series of reactors increased CO2 conversion to 68.5% from 40.8% in a single reactor at the same operating conditions. However, high pressure drop hindered the application of this configuration and recycle reactors were proposed. Recycle reactor (R = 3 and 6 with GHSV of 4000 ml/gcat. hr) resulted in higher CO2 conversion (62.3% and 75.6%), lower olefin selectivity (82.8% and 78.1%) and higher selectivity towards C5+ (74.5% and 71.3%) compared to those for the single reactor. However, when R=5 at GHSV of 2000 ml/gcat. hr, C5+ selectivity (68.3%) decreased, while selectivity towards CH4 (12.1%) and light paraffins (6.8%) increased. Meanwhile, CO2 conversion increased to 88.2% compared to the other recycle reactors. It can be concluded that, recycling, provides more residence time for hydrogenation, which led to further hydrogenation and oligomerization of produced olefins. Nevertheless, the issues regarding water formation could not be solved via these reactors. The water produced during the FT reaction is also perceived to obstruct the RWGS reaction by decreasing CO2 conversion. In addition, water can oxidize the catalyst active sites and shortens the Fe-based catalyst lifetime, which has an additional negative effect on the RWGS reaction rate. Hence, the achievement of a selective and continuous water removal method can be a promising approach for decelerating catalyst deactivation [616–618]. Water removal can shift the RWGS equilibrium towards more CO production, which enhances CO2 conversion and HCs yield [619]. For instance, Bordet et al. [620] demonstrated that in-situ water adsorption by molecular sieves accelerated CO2 conversion via shifting equilibrium RWGS reaction while inhibiting catalyst oxidation. It was observed that, after 7 h CO2 conversion increased from 69 to 79% with using molecular sieves, while selectivity towards CO decreased from 21 to 14%, which showed higher conversion of CO to hydrocarbons in the presence of adsorbents [620]. In addition, Bradley et al. [621] showed that in fixed-bed, catalyst pretreatment with mineral oil as a start-up solvent could increase hydrocarbon yield by 25% while reducing catalyst oxidation via diminishing water adsorption. However, Guo et al. [526] proposed a two-stage reactor with ex-situ water removal. CO2 conversion increased while selectivity towards CO decreased. In addition, this configuration led to the further conversion of CO via FT reaction and hydrocarbon yield increased about 3 times. By employing an ice-trap between two stages the CO2 conversion increased from 24.6 to 65.1%, while the CO selectivity decreased from 15.1% to 3.3%. This resulted in the formation of 227.4 gFuel/kgcat.h liquid fuel which is remarkably higher than that achieved without ex-situ water removal (70.2%) [526]. Moreover, theoretical investigation on the effect of reactor configuration was also performed via modeling fixed-bed reactors in our previous studies. Accordingly, different configurations of single fixed-bed reactors are presented in Fig. 64 (a-c). As mentioned earlier, CO2 hydrogenation to methane and hydrocarbons was investigated via modeling a cylindrical fixed-bed reactor (Fig. 64 (a)) and kinetic parameters were calculated via optimization [97]. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was accomplished in an annular reactor to find the effect of main influential factors [607]. Moreover, the effect of water removal through annular membrane reactors (Fig. 64 (b)) was analyzed in another study [622]. Membrane reactors (MR) have been considered as a promising configuration in CO2 hydrogenation to HCs [617,623]. Water can permeate through the membrane layer due to the water partial pressure gradient. An inert gas such as N2 is introduced to the inner tube side and sweeps the penetrated water [622]. Hydroxy sodalite (H-SOD) is a zeolite-like water-permeable material, which can be used as membrane for water removal [605,624]. It was concluded that MR, lead to increased transformation of CO to hydrocarbons, with the product distribution changed and selectivity towards light hydrocarbons (e.g., C2H4 and C2H6) increased to 21.5 %, and those of C3 hydrocarbons increased to ∼ 15% when pressure ratio and sweep ratio were 2 and 3 respectively. In addition, as the extent of water removal increased via increasing pressure or sweep ratios, the amount of C2 hydrocarbons increased, exceeding production of C3 hydrocarbons, which was attributed to the lack of H2 due to its increased conversion to H2O [622]. This issue was circumvented using a MR permeable to H2 in the outer shell, and to water in the inner shell (Fig. 64 (c)) to adjust the H2 concentration and thus tune the hydrocarbons distribution [625]. In order to adjust hydrogen feeding, a H2 perm-selective membrane was proposed for employment in the MRs [626,627]. Polymeric membranes commonly can be used between 100 and 300 °C, while inorganic membranes can be employed at higher temperatures up to 800 °C. Ceramic membranes can operate at even elevated temperatures of over 1000 °C [628]. Owing to infinite hydrogen perm-selectivity and high thermal stability, palladium-based membranes have been used extensively for H2 permeation [628–630]."
16,Discussion and perspectives,"As described in this review, the hydrogenation of CO2 was a powerful and feasible process for CO2 utilization. However, CO2 is chemically stable and thermodynamically unfavorable, which indicates some limitations on its conversion and utilization. Almost all previous studies aiming to inspect factors affecting the fuel and chemical production efficiency through CO2 hydrogenation that were performed experimentally. High reaction heat, multi reaction systems and sensitive catalysts make CO2 hydrogenation to value-added products (methane, methanol and hydrocarbons) a challenging process with a long history of process research and development. Therefore, various technical methods and specific approaches on catalyst type, operating conditions and rational reactor design, have been accomplished to eliminate these limitations. All extracted data in this review (Tables 1, 2 and 3) have been visualized in terms of CH4, CH3OH and HCs selectivity versus CO2 conversion as follows: It can be observed in Fig. 65 , the methane yields of the most of catalysts are greater than 50%. However, few catalysts including 40Ni-Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 [631], 10Co/ZrO2 [122], Ni-La2O3/SBA-15(c) [632] and 20%Ni/Al2O3 [158] exhibit yields ≥ 90%. Obviously, Ni was the main active site of these catalysts, followed by those comprising Co. In addition, some catalysts on inert supports show very low yields (< 5%) in CO2 methanation such as Mg/SiO2 [181], Pd/SiO2 [181], Co/TiO2 [122], and Pd-Fe/SiO2 [181]. It can be concluded that, TiO2 was not an appropriate support for Co catalyst compared to ZrO2 found to be superior. Markedly the Ru@C-EDTA-20 [115] with a new concept of active sites, i.e. RuC (shell) @Ru (core) exhibit high methane selectivity (100%) with CO2 conversion of about 4.6-17.8% at 160-200 °C. The mentioned catalyst have high methane space time yield (7.56 µmolCH4.s−1.gcat −1) at relatively low temperature, i.e. 180 °C, surpassing the state of the catalyst reported up to now in the literature. Moreover, the yields of plasma assisted reactors containing Ni/ZrO2 [147], CoOx/TiO2 [633], Ni-CexZr1-xO2 [241] catalysts did not exceed 68%, highlighting the need for more process optimization in this area. For methanol production, catalysts containing Cu and Zn showed significant roles in enhancing the methanol yield. Currently, the CAMERE process [634], which is a two step methanol production, including RWGS over ZnAl2O4 followed by H2O removal and methanol synthesis in the presence of Cu/ZnO/ZrO2/Ga2O3 have increased the overal methanol yield to 89%. According to Fig. 66, the methanol yields are almost under 20% except Cu-ZnO/Al2O3 [408], which shows methanol yield of 50.9% while exhibiting a space-time yield of 7729 gMeOH kg-1 h-1. Although most catalysts exhibit high methanol selectivity, their low CO2 conversion led to low methanol yields. In addition, the lowest yields (< 1%) belong to In0.1/ZrO2, Cu-Ba/Al2O3 and Cu(m)/ZnO (m = 1, 5, 8, 15), among which Cu (8)/ZnO and Cu(15)/ZnO had more than 90% methanol selectivity. As depicted in Fig. 67 for light hydrocarbons (C2-C4), the yields do not surpass 30% and some catalysts such as Ru3Ni2/BMI-NTf2 [536], Fe-Cu(0.17)K(1.0)/Al2O3 [509], 5K-10Co/Fe [526] and Fe2O3@KO2/ZrS/SAPO-34 [557] exhibited yields between 20 and 30%. Highest yields for hydrocarbons synthesis belong to the catalysts comprising Fe and K. Besides, it is noteworthy that using 5K-10Co/Fe [526] in a two-stage fixed-bed reactor with ex-situ water removal could result in improved CO2 conversion and thus HCs yield with respect to two stage reactor without water removal. Catalyst with yields lower than 1% all had Fe in their composition like K-Mn-Fe [71], Mn-Fe [71], Fe/TiO2 [462], and Fe/SiO2 [462], which shows that addition of Mn and supporting with TiO2 and SiO2 could not enhance the performance of the resultant Fe-containing catalysts. However, dispersion of Fe-oxides in MOF matrix could enhance the catalyst performance in terms of both stability and selectivity towards hydrocarbons as reported by Liu et al. [635]. In conclusion, much research is yet required to improve the performance of these catalysts in terms of both CO2 conversion and HCs selectivity since this process is still in its infancy. However, while previous results highlighted that both catalyst properties and reactor design play important roles in the hydrogenation of CO2 to CH4, CH3OH and specially HCs, this review identified the crucial role of reactor configuration. Therefore, a new reactor configuration consisting of perm-selective walls to water (RWGS fixed-bed reactor) and hydrogen (fluidized-bed FT reaction) is proposed to take the advantages of controlled removal/dosing potentials of the membrane with excellent gas-solid contact and heat transfer capabilities of a fluidized-bed in one configuration. Moreover, the proposed reactor type usually posses high selectivity and activity, and long catalyst activity for the CO2 hydrogenation. The aim of the proposed reactor configuration including H2O and H2 perm-selective membranes for the first and second reactors, respectively, is to achieve higher CO2 conversion to C2-C4 hydrocarbons. Fe-based catalysts have gained much attention due to their promising application along with a low price [636]. CO2 is reduced by iron (II) continued by H radical secession via adsorbed species on the catalyst surface (Fig. 68 ). The reaction of residual H with carbonyl C results in the formation of OH, formic acid and CO. Fe-CH2 radical forms similarly as a carbon-carbon propagation product. Chain propagation displays the principal reaction route, since higher hydrocarbons are determined as major products. Higher selectivity of α-olefins with respect to that of paraffins is ascribed to less H2 uptake along with no extra H2 in this reaction, which represents the importance of hydrogen dosing during the reaction [96]. Moreover, quite a few studies have considered the effects of the reactor type. Even the best catalyst considering the best support and promoter in the optimized operating conditions could not lead to high hydrocarbon yields due to catalyst deactivation, because water is produced and hot spots occur in the single reactor. Besides, much effort was accomplished to identify the most efficient reactor for this process by comparing experimental data of different reactor types. The most influential effect on CO2 conversion was the reactor configuration, while the catalyst type and the operating conditions effects were most important on product selectivity. The spherical reactor is a rational reactor design to boost the wall surface area of the reactor in order to increase water permeation during the reaction [637]. As a whole, the single fixed-bed reactor can be designed in either annular or spherical configuration, and may be permeable to water or hydrogen for water removal or hydrogen stoichiometry adjustment purposes. Moreover, a spherical reactor can be proposed as an attractive alternative design in comparison with cylindrical reactors owing to its lower pressure drop (which is related to the different cross-sectional area in spherical reactor compared to the cross-sectional area of cylindrical reactor) and recompression costs as well as construction material investment (reduced wall thickness to half) [638–640]. Another alternative to enhance the efficiency of a single fixed-bed reactor is using a fluidized-bed reactor. Due to the superior heat management ability and appropriate temperature control, fluidized-bed reactors are particularly attractive for carrying out highly exothermic reactions. Moreover, they exhibit proper mixing along with a small pressure drop while eliminating diffusion limitations [641]. Other benefits of fluidized-bed reactors include the possibility of using inexpensive metal alloys and periodic/continuous catalyst regeneration and replacement [642]. Saeidi et al. [31] proposed that both methanol and FT reactions could be improved through superseding a fixed-bed by a fluidized-bed reactor. The proposed membrane reactor can be incorporated into both fixed-bed and fluidized-bed reactors to combine the advantages of controlled dosing and removal potentials of the membrane with excellent heat transfer and gas-solid contact capabilities of fluidized-bed reactors. All specifications of the fluidized-bed dual-type membrane reactor for hydrocarbon synthesis are the same as those of a fixed-bed single-stage reactor except the reactor length."
17,Dual-type reactor (two-stage reactor),"5.1 Dual-type reactor (two-stage reactor) The achievement of a high yield indicates that the reactor configuration is chosen appropriately to align with the characteristics of the reaction steps. Key assets for this are to overcome the limitation of the thermodynamic equilibrium, enhancing the kinetics as well as controlling the stoichiometric feed. This can be achieved by dual-type membrane reactors. As mentioned above, there has been no theoretical study on this issue; moreover, none of the previous research has investigated the effects of reactor configuration on HC yields. Therefore, researchers focused on investigating this process theoretically, which led to the introduction of dual-type membrane reactors using a H2O perm-selective membrane in first for the fixed-bed and then for fluidized-bed reactor configuration. Such a combination of reactor effects is able to eradicate catalyst deactivation associated with other types of reactors, while eliminating the produced water and simultaneously adjusting the dosing of hydrogen concentration to prevent reaction distortion caused by temperature fluctuations in the second reactor. Moreover, dual-type membrane reactors already have been proven as the best configuration in the methanol synthesis process in terms of product efficiency. Since the reaction mechanism for H2/CO2 to hydrocarbons was almost the same as that of methanol, this configuration may probably be applicable for CO2 conversion to HCs as well. The outer tubes of both reactors are filled with catalysts. After passing through a heat exchanger, the main feed stream (CO2 + H2) is introduced in the inner tube of the second reactor (where there is no catalyst) from upside and is preheated by the heat released from the exothermic FT. After leaving this reactor, the preheated reactant feed is directed to the top of the outer tube and is fed to the second reactor. To control the reaction stoichiometry in the first reactor and to adjust hydrogen feeding to the second reactor, the wall of the inner tube of the second reactor is configured to be hydrogen perm-selective. Moreover, the presence of a tubular water perm-selective membrane inserted in the wall of the first reactor can strongly shift the RWGS reaction equilibrium to the right side for the production of more CO. In this stage, feed (H2 + CO2) is converted to CO via the endothermic RWGS reaction and the reaction heat is supplied by the furnace of the first reactor. The outlet gas from the first reactor leaves the reactor and enters the outer tube of the second reactor, with the reactant feed (H2 + CO2) flowing from top to down inside the inner tube. The chemical reaction occurs on the catalyst surface, while the main feed stream removes the generated heat of the FT reaction. In this way, the catalysts are prevented from exposure to extreme temperatures and catalyst deactivation via sintering and hot spot formation can be circumvented. Finally, by passing through a heat exchanger, the product temperature is decreased while that of the reactant is increased. In general, the two-stage catalyst bed system can operate with higher conversion and longer catalyst lifetime. Fig. 69 (a-g) depict the complete configuration and elemental volume of dual-type reactors in detail. It should be emphasized that combining both hydrogen and water perm-selective membranes can help to compensate the hydrogen shortage, which is permeated in the form of water. The general advantages of the proposed dual-type membrane reactors are as follows: 1- The feasibility of heat integration: considering two reactors instead of a single reactor due to the two different kinds of reaction with regard to the reaction mechanism, allows using the heat of the exothermic reaction to preheat the feed of the endothermic reactor. 2- Reduced byproduct formation: using a H2O perm-selective membrane in the first reactor (RWGS), fast deactivation of catalyst due to the formation of carbon deposition is prevented. In addition, the equilibrium shifts towards more CO production, which is the feed of the second reactor (FT). 3- Increased reaction rates: hydrogen dosing along the reactor length can be controlled as second reactor is H2 perm-selective, which prevents the Boudouard reaction (R18). 4- Increased surface area of permeation: employing a spherical membrane reactor results in increased ratio of the lateral surface area to the reactor volume compared to that of a cylindrical reactor, which results in higher water and hydrogen permeation."
18,Corrugated and CANS reactors,"5.2 Corrugated and CANS reactors Finally yet importantly, there are arguments for forthcoming investigation to put an emphasis on a rational reactor design to shift the reaction toward the product side while maintaining the catalyst activity during the reaction. This may be accomplished via increasing the surface area of the membrane reactor wall using a corrugated membrane concept to increase the surface area (Fig. 70 (a) to enhance both heat and mass transfer capabilities. This novel reactor configuration for CO2 hydrogenation to value-added products is based on theoretical insight via surface science approaches in line with reaction mechanisms (Fig. 68), which might bridge the gap between the macroscopic characteristics of practical catalysts and potential drawbacks of the fixed-bed reactor in order to overcome low value-added products efficiency. Corrugated or convoluted membranes have been used in hydrogen processing systems as developed configurations [643–647]. Fig. 70 (a) presents a proposed configuration of permeable dual-type reactors for which the inner tubes of both reactors are corrugated to increase the permeation area. The first configuration includes two fixed-bed corrugated membrane reactors, which are both permeable to water and hydrogen in the inner and outer tubes, respectively to circumvent equilibrium while compromising the hydrogen loss. Recently, British Petroleum (BP) and Johnson Matthey have demonstrated the crucial role of co-developing both reactor configuration (to enhance productivity) and catalyst (to enhance selectivity) for FT synthesis. A novel catalyst carrier reactor for FT technology entitled “CANS” Fig. 70 (b) was designed which exhibits higher productivity, superior heat transfer, reduced pressure drop offering major economic savings over conventional fixed-bed reactors [676]. According to this configuration, syngas enters the central channel (A) from the top catalyst carrier, and flows through the catalyst bed radially where FT reaction takes place (B). The hot gases leave through a porous outer wall and flow towards the top of the inner-side of catalyst carrier (C). As the gases flow down between the catalyst carrier and inner tube wall, heat is removed by water in the cooling jacket (D). The gases then pass through the next catalyst carrier below and the process repeats (E). The design of this CANS reactor should also offer advantages for CO2 hydrogenation to light olefins."
19,Conclusions,"As the main greenhouse gas, CO2 increase in the atmosphere is mostly considered to be responsible for climate change and global warming, CO2 transformation to fuels and chemicals would be helpful to circulate carbon in order to diminish the greenhouse effect. Methane, methanol and HCs can be exploited as fuel substitutes, emerging energy storage media and raw materials of petrochemical products. Thus, CO2 hydrogenation can efficiently decrease the CO2 accumulation and diminish the greenhouse gas effect, while producing valuable chemicals and fuels. Currently, many investigations have been performed in this regard, but many issues to concerning commercialization of CO2 hydrogenation to value-added products have not been solved yet. I There are still numerous opportunities to improve the performance and stability (thermal, and water-tolerance) of catalysts. In methanation process, Ni-based catalysts are commonly employed (even commercially) due to their high performance in terms of both conversion and selectivity along with low price. In addition, hybrid catalytic-plasma reactors have gained much attention for methanation reaction to reduce the reaction temperature. However, much research is yet required to enhance the thermal durability of methanation catalysts. For methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation, Cu-based catalysts have been predominantly used due to their high methanol formation rate, which might be decreased considerably if selectivity towards methanol increased above 80%. However, low stability of Cu particles due to oxidation is one of the challenging issues in methanol synthesis, which was reported to be diminished via active-site encapsulation. In addition, agglomeration of other catalyst components (such as ZnO) in the presence of Cu, is another issue that necessitates further investigation to improve the performance of these catalysts [648]. For hydrocarbon production via CO2 hydrogenation, Fe-based catalysts (specially oxides) including K as promoter showed better performance although still far from being commercialized. In addition, support plays an important role in olefin selectivity specially in methanol-mediated pathway. II A comprehensive insight about active species and their interactions, along with interaction among active centers with promoter and support are of paramount significance for catalyst design and tailoring. Accordingly, in-situ characterization techniques (XRD, TEM, and X-ray absorption) should be employed to distinguish active sites, while analytical methods such as XPS and DFT calculations are required to identify the main surface species to explain the elusive reaction mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation to value-added products. Besides, in-situ structural and surface studies under working conditions can be performed to validate the proposed mechanism. III In addition to catalytic studies, thermodynamic aspects of CO2 hydrogenation should be considered as well to prevail the equilibrium limitation on product yield. Primarily, optimization of reaction conditions should be taken into consideration. Moreover, the design and optimization of CO2 hydrogenation reactors should be analyzed comprehensively. Therefore, novel reactors like perm-selective membrane reactors have been presented, to remove water and in turn shift the thermodynamic equilibrium towards the desired product. The outcomes of this review can create incentives for further research about exploiting multicomponent catalysts and multifunctional reactors to circumvent the challenging issues of CO2 hydrogenation to value-added products."
