0,Introduction,"Expensive fossil fuel and natural gas prices, in addition to pollution concern, warrant the need for nonpolluting, alternative energy sources. Hydrogen may be an ideal, clean and sustainable energy source for the future due to its high conversion efficiency and nonpolluting nature [1,2]. Compared to electrochemical and thermo-chemical hydrogen production processes, bio-hydrogen production via converting biomass to hydrogen is more environmentally friendly and attracts attention all over the world [3,4]. Associated with organic wastewater or other wastes treatment, bio-hydrogen generation would further the global environmental conservation and become more attractive [5,6]. In the past years, some complex waste substrates (municipal solid waste [7], food waste [8] and sugar beet [9]) had been used in bio-hydrogen production. Current production of biological hydrogen is generally divided into two categories: photosynthetic and anaerobic fermentation [10]. The production of hydrogen from low-cost organic substrates using anaerobic fermentation methods may be one of the most promising methods [11]. Up to now, many researches have been performed on anaerobic fermentation. This method is known as a system requiring less energy intensive and low energy input. Apart from H 2 and CO 2 , the main soluble metabolites generally are acetic acid (HAc), propionic acid (HPr), butyric acid (HBu), and alcohols. Anaerobic fermentative bacteria used include Clostridia, Escherichia and Citrobacter [12–14]. It has been proved that the mixed microflora taking anaerobic bacteria as predominant species can become a good microflora source for organic waste fermentative hydrogen production [15]. Bio-hydrogen production requires essential micronutrients for bacterial metabolism during fermentation. Sodium, magnesium, zinc and iron are all important trace metals affecting hydrogen production. Among them iron is an important nutrient element to form hydrogenase or other enzymes which almost all bio-hydrogen production needs fundamentally [16]. Furthermore, in waste water treatment, iron (III) compound has often been used to organic contamination biodegrading as electron acceptor, for instance, benzene and toluene degradation. And some of the reported effects of nitrate on hydrocarbon biodegradation may be indirect through the reoxidation of iron (II) [17]. However, these studies on iron mainly focused on utilizing ferrous sulfate as flocculants in water treatment. There is thus little information on how the iron concentration influences hydrogen production via fermentative bacteria. In this study, in order to convert soluble starch to high-value hydrogen efficiently, we investigated the role of ferrous ion concentration on anaerobic mixed bacteria for hydrogen production. In light of low pH inhibiting the activity of iron-containing hydrogenase [18], two series of experiments were employed for studying the effect of iron on starch at various initial pH values. Furthermore, the series three experiments investigated the influence of starch concentration on the hydrogen production at optimum iron concentration. Since there does not exist remarkable effect of SO 4 2 + on hydrogen production in previous studies, we used FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O as addition [19,20]."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Inoculum,"2.1 Inoculum The anaerobic mixed cultures used here were enriched in the completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR) in chemostat for about 1 month [20]. The reactor was operated at 35 ∘ C , a 12h hydraulic retention time (HRT), and stirred by gas circulation. The organisms responsible for hydrogen production were dominated by Clostridium pasteurianum [21]. Feed solution for the reaction contained 10.0g/l of soluble starch and synthetic substrate. Each liter of the synthetic substrate contained NH 4 HCO 3 , 3770mg; K 2 HPO 4 , 125mg; Na 2 CO 3 , 2000mg; CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O , 5mg; MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O , 100mg; MnSO 4 · 4 H 2 O , 15mg; FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O , 25mg; CoCl 2 · 6 H 2 O , 0.125mg. The substrate reservoir was kept at 4– 5 ∘ C by a water bath."
3,Experimental procedures,"2.2 Experimental procedures Batch experiments were conducted in 120ml vials. After addition of 20ml inoculum, 40ml nutrient solution (prepared by adding soluble starch, 20000mg; NH 4 HCO 3 , 7540mg; NaHCO 3 , 4000mg; K 2 HPO 4 , 250mg; CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O , 10mg; MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O , 200mg; MnSO 4 · 4 H 2 O , 30mg; CoCl 2 · 6 H 2 O , 0.25mg) was added into 1l of distilled water. After that, 20ml of the FeSO 4 solution was added into it. The concentration of FeSO 4 ranged from 0, 25, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 2400, 3200 to 4000mg/l in the batch experiment, and it excluded the residual iron concentration in the inoculum. The total work volume in the bottles was 80ml, which resulted in a solution with a desired concentration of 10.0g starch/l. The air was removed from the headspace by argon gas sparging for 5min before the bottles were capped with rubber septum stoppers and placed in a reciprocal shaker (reciprocation: 5 cm × 120 strokes per min ). The batch experiments were conducted at 35 ∘ C in the dark. The solution was adjusted to an initial pH = 8.0 or 7.0 with 1M HCl or 1M NaOH. Each experimental condition was carried out in triplicate."
4,Analysis,"2.3 Analysis The H 2 gas production was calculated from headspace measurements of gas composition and the total volume of biogas production, at each time interval, using the mass equation: V H , i = V H , i - 1 + C H , i ( V G , i - V G , i - 1 ) + V H , 0 ( C H , i - C H , i - 1 ) , where V H , i and V H , i - 1 are cumulative H 2 volumes at the current ( i ) and previous ( i - 1 ) time intervals, V G , i and V G , i - 1 , are the total biogas volumes in the current and previous time intervals which was measured by a plunger displacement method using appropriately sized glass syringes, ranged from 10 to 100ml. C H , i and C H , i - 1 are the fraction of H 2 in the head space of the bottle at the current and previous intervals and V H , 0 is the total volume of headspace in the bottle [22]. All gas production data reported were standardized to standard temperature ( 0 ∘ C ) and pressure (760mmHg). The fraction of H 2 was determined with a gas chromatograph (SHIMADZU 14B, Japan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A 2-m stainless iron column packed with Porapak Q (50/80 mesh). Argon was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 30ml/min. The operating temperatures of the injection port, the oven, and the detector were 100, 60 and 100 ∘ C , respectively. Detection of the solvent metabolites (VFAs, C 2 – C 4 ) was also analyzed by a gas chromatograph (SHIMADZU 14B, Japan) using a flame ionization detector (FID). A 2-m glass column packed with Unisole F-200 (30/60 mesh). The temperatures of the injection port, the oven, and the detector were 200, 150, and 220 ∘ C , respectively. The carrier gas was also argon gas at a flow rate of 30ml/min. The concentrations of soluble starch after the reaction were determined by the phenol–sulfuric acid method using sucrose as a standard [23]. The concentrations of volatile suspended solids (VSS) were determined according to the procedures described in the standard methods [24]. The pH was measured using a pH meter (PHS-3B Shanghai, China)."
5,Results and discussions,
6,Effect of iron concentration on H 2 production at initial pH 8.0,"3.1 Effect of iron concentration on H 2 production at initial pH 8.0 In view of the activity of hydrogenase and the effect of pH on H 2 production, an initial pH 8.0 was used firstly in this study. Batch experiments were examined until the H 2 production end. The effect of different amounts of iron on the H 2 production and the solvent products is shown in Table 1 . Gas product analyses represent that the biogas only contains H 2 and CO 2 without any detectable CH 4 and H 2 S during the course of H 2 production. The result suggests that no sulfate-reducing bacteria and methanogens in the culture were used, and that high SO 4 2 + concentration has no influence on H 2 production. The result is not consistent with previously reported result [25], probably due to difference of mixed microflora and reaction conditions. The H 2 content firstly increased from 42% (at 0mg FeSO 4 / l ) to a peak value of 55.8% (at 100mg FeSO 4 / l ) and then varied from 52% to 55% with increasing the iron concentrations. The influence of iron on cumulative hydrogen volume is shown in Fig. 1 (a). The H 2 production rapidly increased with increasing the iron concentration within the range of 0–150mg/l, and the maximum hydrogen yield (279.9ml/g-starch) was obtained at the iron concentration of 150mg FeSO 4 / l . When iron concentration ranged from 150 to 800mg FeSO 4 / l , the cumulative hydrogen volume slightly decreased. While the iron concentrations were more than 800mg FeSO 4 / l , the cumulative H 2 volumes did not decrease, instead, and formed a high H 2 -producing plateau, on which every volume value was close to the maximum value required under the 150mg FeSO 4 / l . Namely, with high iron concentrations of 1600, 2400, 3200 and 4000mg FeSO 4 / l , the corresponding total cumulative H 2 volumes were 204.1, 217.8, 221.3 and 207.0ml, respectively. In addition, as shown in Fig. 1(b), when the concentrations of iron were within 1600–4000mg FeSO 4 / l , the H 2 production ended earlier (about 70h) than other bottles (more than 100h ) did. As compared with the bottles with 150mg FeSO 4 / l , lag-phase time and end time of them had all about 22h shortened, though 96h at iron concentration of 150mg FeSO 4 / l was far less than other results (over 100h, even more than 130h). Furthermore, as for lower concentration of iron (less than 400mg FeSO 4 / l ), the slopes were much lower than that of the systems at higher concentration of iron (over 800mg FeSO 4 / l ). These results seem to represent that the addition of increased iron into the medium cause the H 2 evolution to rapidly happen and end at pH 8.0. This result was unexpected and the detailed investigation followed it. Through further research, we found that under the anaerobic conditions, green flocculent sediment always occurred in these systems as soon as an amount of iron was added at initial pH 8.0. In fact, via calculating toward ferrous iron chemistry in closed carbonate buffers system, we found the sediment is mainly FeCO 3 at initial pH 8.0 and the amount of iron is about 38.0mg/l. The high hydrogen production plateau may be due to this kind of special sediment. After the addition of overfull iron, the FeCO 3 sediment rapidly fall together with the soluble organic substrate, and formed a sort of floccule. Meanwhile, the mixed bacteria cell was also immobilized on it by sorption. And the floccule enhanced the chance of bacteria to meet the substrate, and accelerated the assimilation of them to the substrate. At the same time, it also reduced the concentration of soluble ferrous iron in the closed system, consequently, and lessened the inhibitive influence of iron to H 2 evolution. Furthermore, as shown in Table 1, the final pH values (more than 50 mg FeSO 4 / l ) were all adjacent to 5.3, which were greater than final that of previous studies [19,21], showing an advance in buffer intensity because of addition of overfull iron. Meantime, it also shows that pH is not the inhibitory factor which stops H 2 production. Besides, the cumulative H 2 volumes with sharper slopes were all adjacent to 225ml in systems. The result shows that the soluble starch was used up in a shorter time and the consumption of substrate might be mainly responsible for reaction end. In fact, it was found that the soluble iron concentration has a slightly inhibitive influence on hydrogen production. When the concentration of iron is over 150mg FeSO 4 / l , a slight decline occurred from 225ml ( [ FeSO 4 ] = 150 mg / l ) to 180ml ( [ FeSO 4 ] = 800 mg / l ) . But the declination was counteracted by the flocculation. Considering iron limitation and flocculation, the optimal concentration of iron is 150mg FeSO 4 / l in the closed system. Over it, iron concentration would inhibit the starch fermentation. The initial soluble iron concentration (ca. about 40mg FeSO 4 / l ) in closed system met the first need of bacteria growth. But with the reaction processing and VFAs appearing, iron was released gradually out of the floccule. It made soluble iron concentration maintain a proper level till reaction end. It is certain that the proper level changes with different initial pH in the system. As an outer improving approach, adsorptive sedimentation may enhance chances of bacteria to meet organic substances by contact adsorption. It may be helpful to improve bio-hydrogen production. But ferrite sediment might be more biological catalysis via various iron-chelated enzymes, unlike simple inorganic flocculation."
7,Effect of iron concentration on H 2 production at initial pH 7.0,"3.2 Effect of iron concentration on H 2 production at initial pH 7.0 Fig. 2 depicts that iron concentration influences bio-hydrogen production when initial pH is 7.0. As described in Fig. 2(a), the cumulative H 2 volume first increased from 90 to 236ml in the range of 0–150mg FeSO 4 / l and decreased gradually from 236 to 100ml when iron exceeded 150mg FeSO 4 / l . The maximum value was 236ml obtained at [ FeSO 4 ] 150mg /l, similar to the result found at initial pH 8.0. In contrast with Fig. 1(a), it was obvious that a high H 2 -producing plateau under increased iron concentration (over 800mg FeSO 4 / l ) was not formed. The reason for the absence of high plateau under pH 7.0, though FeCO 3 flocculation also occurred at pH 8.0, may be due to the fact that the distinction of initial pH causes the change of initial solubility of ferrous iron (ca. from about 40 to 200mg FeSO 4 / l in closed system). Namely, the initial concentration of iron (more than 200mg FeSO 4 / l added) exceeded the optimum concentration of iron (about 150mg FeSO 4 / l ). After the addition of FeSO 4 , with the iron concentration increased from 200 to 4000mg FeSO 4 / l , the excess soluble iron was harmful to the mixed microbe, and then resulted in final decrease of hydrogen production in these systems. So, whether the initial concentration of soluble iron met the need of bacteria growth or not made the difference of bio-hydrogen production under various pH conditions. The decrease in H 2 production when iron concentration was higher than 150mg FeSO 4 / l shows that iron concentration has slightly inhibitive influence on H 2 production, and that bio-hydrogen production from soluble starch has the optimum iron concentration (150mg FeSO 4 / l ). Namely, considering iron inhibition and flocculation, 150mg FeSO 4 / l was the optimized value at pH 7.0 in these systems. As initial iron concentration was higher than 150mg FeSO 4 / l , superfluous soluble iron would become an inhibitor to H 2 production. The inhibition will last to the end and become stronger and stronger with pH decrease due to the appearance of VFAs. As shown in Fig. 2(b), all lag-phase time and end time within the range of 0–400mg FeSO 4 / l were less than the corresponding data required at pH 8.0. It indicates that initial pH 7.0 favors more bacteria propagation comparatively. Meanwhile, as indicated in Table 2 , the final pH decreased slightly (from 5.5 to 5.1) when iron was over 400mg FeSO 4 / l (but not less than 5.0), whereas the consumption of organic substrate was not complete. The results indicate that the inhibition of reaction would have resulted from iron inhibition and not from the formation of VFAs. Furthermore, the soluble products in all bottles did not change, without other alcohols or acids being produced. And with the reaction processing, this kind of green sediment observed gradually faded and the system became almost transparent finally. The fact suggests that the inhibition did not bring the disappearance of H 2 -producting bioactivity of microbe and the switching among metabolic approaches. So the inhibition is less and not fatal."
8,Effect of iron on solvent products and H recovery,"3.3 Effect of iron on solvent products and H recovery The variety of solvent products and their distributions are important indicators for analyzing hydrogen production during the anaerobic fermentation. As shown in Table 1, during the anaerobic digestion process, any other solvent products like methonal or ethanol were not found in all bottles. However, with trace amount of propionate detected, significant amount of butyrate and acetate were produced all the time under these conditions. Especially, the four values (1600, 2400, 3200, and 4000mg FeSO 4 / l ) on the high H 2 -producing plateau, for example, occurred with higher solvent metabolites (total amount of VFAs was over 370mg/g-starch). For these systems at pH 7.0, as indicated in Table 2, a smaller amount of HPr (about 20mg/g-starch) was detected likewise, the solvent products were mainly HBu and HAc. Besides, the major VFAs yield always became greater with increase in H 2 yield, for instance, at initial pH 7.0, the large amount of HBu (262.6mg/g-starch) and HAc (148.7mg/g-starch) always accorded with the high H 2 yield (296.2ml/g-starch) required at an iron concentration of 150mg FeSO 4 / l . These results show that converting soluble starch to HBu and HAc is the major metabolism pattern in batch culture. Considering the distributions of VFAs, for earlier end system, the ratio of HBu/HAc was always more than that of other systems with late end time. The ratio frequently has been used as the parameter for evaluating the efficiency of H 2 production [26,27]. The result may suggest that HBu pathway more favors efficient H 2 production. Furthermore, by comparison of starch fermentation at initial pH 8.0 and 7.0, we can reach some conclusions. First, for pH 8.0 systems, since unchanged VFAs formation was observed, the reason why the flocculation could accelerate the hydrogen production was not due to metabolic pathway shifts. Second, in two series of iron experiments no change of solvent products also indicated that iron limitation did not change the metabolic routes of predominant bacteria. However, the activity of hydrogenenase, some iron-containing enzymes, was not affected, which probably contributed to the H 2 -producing plateau. Third, soluble starch rapid consumption and the larger amount of HBu was coupled under various iron concentrations, suggesting that the producing butyrate bacteria were the main force of H 2 production. Finally, with reaction end time prolonged, the quantities of HAc gradually increased, showing that partial HBu probably was further converted to HAc at the end of reaction. The total organic substrate degradation efficiency (TOSDE) was completely ( 99.1 ± 0.2 % ) consumed in all bottles. The main difference between two series of tests of irons was H recovery. The H recovery at pH 7.0 generally exceeded corresponding to that obtained at pH 8.0, e.g. 115.7% under pH 7.0 was more than 98.4% under pH 8.0 at the same iron concentration of 150mg FeSO 4 / l . It indicates that the initial pH 7.0 is a better pH condition to the mixed bacteria. Furthermore, at initial pH 8.0, the high H 2 -producing plateau always corresponded to high H recovery, for example, at iron concentration of 3200mg FeSO 4 / l , the H recovery (116.3%) was the maximum value among all experimental data. It shows that the H element of soluble starch is efficiently converted at higher iron concentrations. In both series of experiments, the biomass yield (dry biomass weight) all increased rapidly with increasing iron concentrations (below 150mg FeSO 4 / l ). The maximum values were 185.4mg/g-starch (pH 8.0) and 159.3mg/g-starch (pH 7.0), respectively. When iron concentration exceeded 150mg FeSO 4 / l , as for initial pH 8.0, the biomass yield first slightly decreased from 185.4 ( [ FeSO 4 ] 150mg/l) to 178.5mg/g-starch ( [ FeSO 4 ] 400mg/l), and then increased from about 178.5 to 187.4mg/g-starch ( [ FeSO 4 ] 4000mg/l), accompanied with the high H 2 yield plateau appearing. But, as for initial pH 7.0 systems, the biomass yield gradually decreased from the peak value, 159.3–113.4mg/g-starch. The result indicates that the starch consumption and bacteria growth are coupled under iron limitation. Meanwhile, redundant solvent ferrous iron affected both the cultivation and the hydrogen-producing activity of the bacteria. From the distribution of the dry biomass weight, we could also conclude the same result that the high H 2 production is always with greater dry biomass weight."
9,Substrate concentration effects,"3.4 Substrate concentration effects Table 3 summarized the results of series three experiments on investigating the effect of starch concentration (from 5 to 40g/l) on H 2 production. The soluble ferrous iron concentration, temperature, initial pH was operated at 150mg FeSO 4 / l , 35 ∘ C and 7.0, respectively. In batch culture, the soluble starch was degraded as possible (TOSDE over 97.0 ± 0.2 % ) and was converted to hydrogen gas (H recovery fraction over 23.6%) by the mixed bacteria. As described in Fig. 3 , the cumulative volumes of hydrogen increased gradually from 80 at 5g/l to 260ml at 20g/l, and then kept the same level (around 260ml) with starch concentration increasing from 20 to 40g/l. The results demonstrate that the starch-utilizing hydrogen fermentation has no starch concentration inhibition. The stopping of final hydrogen production may be due to the complete consumption of other nutrients. The optimum soluble starch concentration is 20g/l with the maximum value of cumulative H 2 volume (260.5ml) and the H recovery of 94.4%. But when starch concentration exceeded 20g/l, end time was longer (from 160h at 20g-starch/l to 220h at 40g-starch/l) and trace amount of alcohols (15–20mg/g-starch) appeared in final solvent products. The composition and distribution of VFAs/alcohols were only slightly dependent on the starch concentration. This was similar to the previous observation [28]. The result suggests that the metabolic pathway may shifts with the reaction being prolonged. Furthermore, the starch concentration (10g/l) used above had the optimized H recovery (100.5%) and the high hydrogen yield (258.8ml/g-starch). The result suggests that starch concentration of 10.0g/l favors bacterial metabolism and other nutrient substrates are ample and produce no influence on results attained in iron batch tests."
10,Conclusions,"Two series of experimental results demonstrate that soluble iron has inhibitive influence on bio-hydrogen production from soluble starch when soluble iron concentration exceeds 150mg FeSO 4 / l . As initial pH was equal to 8.0, because of flocculation of FeCO 3 , containing ferrous sediment and other substrates, the concentration of soluble iron was lower in these systems. This kind of flocculation accelerated hydrogen production and substrate conversion via sorption, similar to cell-immobilized mechanism. Otherwise, the accelerated hydrogen production may contribute to soluble ferrous iron as supplement improved the bioactivity of hydrogenases. With the increase of VFAs gradually, this kind of flocculation was dissolved and ferrous iron was released gradually. Released iron maintained bacteria, but did not result in inhibitive influence. As for initial pH 7.0 systems, when iron concentration was more than 150mg FeSO 4 / l , though flocculation still occurred, the superfluous soluble iron slightly inhibited H 2 production from the beginning and led to disappearance of H 2 -producing acceleration finally. The optimal iron concentration was also 150mg FeSO 4 / l with H 2 yield (296.2ml/g-starch) via anaerobic mixed microflora. In addition, the concentration of soluble starch had no remarkable influence on the bio-hydrogen production. The optimum starch concentration and the maximum cumulative hydrogen were 20g/l and 260.5ml, respectively."
