0,Introduction,"Water gas shift (WGS) is a reaction of CO and H2O to form H2 and CO2, which is widely used in industrial hydrogen production from coal, petroleum and natural gas [1–3]. WGS is favorable at low temperature due to the exothermic characteristic of the reaction [4–6]. Generally, noble metals (Pt, Pd, Au et al.) exhibit much higher activity than Cu- and Fe-based catalysts at low temperature (<200 ℃) [1,3]. An alternative cheap and abundant material is promising due to the high cost and limited supply of noble metals. Molybdenum carbides are demonstrated to be potential candidates due to their similar electronic structure to platinum [7,8]. The hybridization of the d-orbital of Mo and the s-orbital and p-orbital of carbon can lead to the broadening of d-band structure of molybdenum carbides [9–11]. Molybdenum carbides have mainly two crystal phases, cubic α-MoC1- x with an ABCABC stacking sequence and hexagonal β-Mo2C with an ABAB packing of metal planes [12]. Excellent catalytic performance of molybdenum carbides was found in WGS [13–15], biomass [7], methane steam reforming [16], aqueous phase methanol reforming [17,18], CO2 hydrogenation [19–21] and many other fields. On the one hand, as supports, they can re-disperse noble metals during carbonization process due to the strong metal-support interaction through chemical bonding [22]. High surface area Mo2C was reported to be an efficient support for Pt nanoparticles in WGS reaction, even exhibiting higher activity compared to the most active oxide supported Pt catalysts such as Pt/CeO2 and Pt/TiO2 [23]. On the other hand, they can also be treated as an active phase due to their ability in the bond cleavage of CO and activating water to give surface OH groups, especially for α-MoC1- x [4,15,22]. For example, 2% Au/α-MoC1- x could convert 90% CO at 120 ℃ [15], while 2% (Pt1-Pt n )/α-MoC1- x even exhibit activity at reaction temperature as low as 40 ℃ in WGS [24]. Likewise, Pt/α-MoC1- x exhibit excellent activity in the aqueous phase reforming of methanol reaction [17]. Moreover, carbonization process was also critical for phase transfer. For one-step carbonization, MoO3 will undergo the non-topotactic route and transfer to β-Mo2C rather than α-MoC1- x during the carbonization process. In order to obtain high purity α-MoC1- x , ammonification treatment before carbonization process is always used to achieve a topotactic route for phase transfer. However, high-temperature ammonification treatment of MoO3 with plenty of pure NH3 that used in the above works was environment unfriendly and has high demands on tightness and corrosion resistance properties of reactor. In addition, α-MoC1- x can easily transfer into more stable state (β-Mo2C) at high temperature. Therefore, the controlling of crystalline structure formation and phase transfer during carbonization are highly desired. The effects of some metals supported by Mo carbides on catalytic performance and crystal phase were investigated, especially in transition and noble metals. It has been reported that Co addition would mainly obtain β-Mo2C, which performed higher activity than commercial CuZnAl catalyst due to the formation of Co-Mo-C x bimetallic active sites [25–27]. The addition of K, Zr dramatically improved the catalytic performance, given that the presence of K significantly promoted water dissociation, while Zr prevented the oxidation of β-Mo2C [27]. Moreover, Pt, Au, Pd, Ni supported on Mo carbides exhibited 4–8 times higher than that of the commercial CuZnAl catalyst over WGS reaction [14]. As reported, Pt, Pd or Ni additives facilitated to form cubic α-MoC1- x phase, while Co or Cu resulted in the hexagonal β-Mo2C phase as those MoO3 without any metals [28]. In addition, the Mo carbides phase could also be controlled by metal loadings. Abudula et al. [29,30] also summarized that the β-Mo2C phase was formed by doping Fe, Co, or Ni, while Pt will lead to a mixture of the two phases. Especially, more α-MoC1- x phase was produced with increasing Pt loading, indicating that the amounts of metals had a great effect on the obtained phase of Mo carbides. Likewise, the content of α-MoC1− x increased with increasing the Cu loading in Cu/Mo carbides from 1.6 to 10–15% due to its promotion on the topotactic route during the carburization process [31]. Therefore, distinguished effects on catalytic performance and crystal structure of Mo carbides can be found on various metals. However, high metal loadings will lead to high final cost, even for noble metals. Therefore, there has a great significance for exploring methods for a high efficient utilization of noble metals and hydrogen production. In this paper, flame spray pyrolysis method was introduced to improve the Mo carbides crystal and structure. Catalytic performance over WGS reaction including hydrogen production rates and catalytic stability, as well as phase transfer of Mo carbides modified by various metals were systematically investigated. We elaborated the function of MoO3 supported metals (Au, Pt, Rh, Cu) on the carbonization process and phase transfer between α and β phase. Additional effects of different amounts of metals on the stability of MoC x catalysts were also discussed. The current study demonstrates the feasibility of using metals to control phase transfer of Mo carbides and greatly improve catalytic performance in aspects of both activity and stability."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation MoO3 was prepared by using the flame spray pyrolysis method and the calcination method, denoted as MoO3-FSP and MoO3-CM, respectively. The one purchased from Aladdin company was named as commercial MoO3 (MoO3-Com). FSP method was described as before [32,33]. Briefly, Mo acetylacetonate was firstly dissolved in a mixture of the benzyl alcohol (BnOH) and 2-ethylhexanoic acid (EHA) with a volume ratio of 1:1, keeping the Mo metal concentration at 0.5 M. After ultrasonic treatment for 2 h, the precursor solution was injected into the nozzle (NanoPowder Nozzle, npn) at a flow rate of 5 mL/min in the help of a syringe pump (PHD UltraTM, Harvard). The flame combustion was supported by a mixture of CH4 (0.6 L/min) and O2 (1.9 L/min). O2 (3.5 L/min) and air (5 L/min) were used as the dispersion and sheath gas, respectively. The product nanoparticles were collected by a collection cylinder and a water-cooled glass fiber filter (Whatman GF/D, 25.7 cm in diameter) in the aiding of a vacuum pump. Calcination method (CM) was performed as reported [15]. Ammonium paramolybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O; >81% as MoO3; Tianjin Hengxin) was heated to 500 ℃ at an increasing rate of 10 ℃/min in air for 4 h. MoO3 supported catalysts M/MoO3 (M represents Pt, Rh, Au, Cu) with metal loadings from 0.025 to 5 wt% were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method. The prepared MoO3 by FSP were impregnated in an appropriate amount of precursor solution (H2PtCl6, RhCl3, H2AuCl4, CuNO3) for 6 h at room temperature (RT). M/MoO3 catalysts were obtained after evaporation at 80 ℃ for 2 h without further calcination. MoO3 supported catalysts M/MoO3 (M represents La, Ba, Na) with metal loadings 5 wt% were prepared by FSP method. Metal precursors (La acetylacetonate, Sodium ethoxide, Barium acetate) were dissolved and mixed in Mo precursor solution. The other steps were the same with the FSP process described above. The samples are denoted as yM/MoO3, where y represents the weight percent of metal loading. Mo carbide samples were synthesized via a temperature programmed carbonization (TPC) method. Mo oxides were crushed and sieved into 20–40 mesh and were placed into a quartz reactor with an i.d. of 6 mm. Typically, for MoO3 and yM/MoO3 (M represents La, Ba, Na) samples, temperature was increased from RT to 300 °C with 5 °C/min, then further increased from 300 to 700 °C with 1 °C/min and held at 700 °C for 2 h in 20 vol% CH4/H2 (50 mL/min). For yM/MoO3 (M represents Pt, Rh, Au, Cu), the samples were heated from room temperature (RT) to 700 ℃ at a rate of 5 ℃/min and then held for 2 h in a 20% CH4/H2 (50 mL/min) mixture. After cooling down to RT in the same atmosphere, the samples were used directly for reaction or passivated in a 1% O2/Ar mixture (50 mL/min) for 12 h for further characterizations. The samples after carbonization are denoted as yM/MoC x . For comparison, pure α-MoC1- x sample was made by a two-steps ammonification-carbonization method. MoO3 precursors were heated from RT to 700 ℃ at 5 ℃/min and kept at 700 ℃ for 2 h in pure NH3 atmosphere with a flow rate of 150 mL/min, and then subsequently cooled down to RT. In the second step, the TPC process was the same with the carbonization described above."
3,Catalytic tests,"2.2 Catalytic tests The water–gas shift (WGS) reaction was performed in a tubular quartz reactor (i.d. = 8 mm) on a homemade setup. 130 mg catalyst (20–40 mesh) was placed between two quartz wool layers in the middle of the reactor. After carbonization, the catalytic activity was evaluated in a mixture of 5% CO, 20% H2O and 75% He (GHSV = 30,000 mL·gcat −1·h−1). Water was injected into a preheater with a calibrated double-plunger pump (Elite P230), where it was vaporized and mixed with the dry feed gas components. Excess steam in the tail gas was condensed in a cooling trap. CO and CO2 were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-8A) equipped with a TDX-01 carbon molecular sieve column. The conversion of CO (X CO, in %) was calculated according to X C O = [ C O 2 ] o u t [ C O 2 ] o u t + [ C O ] o u t × 100 where [ C O 2 ] o u t and [ C O ] o u t are the CO2 and CO concentrations, respectively."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns was performed using an X-ray powder diffractometer produced by PANalytical in the Netherlands. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out on a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI spectrometer with Al Kα as the X-ray source. The element sprits of Rh 3d, Mo 3d, O 1s, C 1s were measured in XPS. Peaks centered at 284.8 eV corresponded to adventitious carbon and were used to reference the other binding energies. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was performed using a FINESORB-3010C Chemical adsorption instrument produced by Finetec in China. The samples were pretreated by heating from room temperature (RT) to 300 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C/min and hold for 0.5 h in Ar (99.99%, 30 mL/min). After cooling down, they were heated from RT to 800 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C/min in 5% H2/Ar at 30 mL/min. Field emission transmission electron microscope (FETEM) was performed using a FEI Talos 200F. Their chemical components were examined using a FEI Super-X energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) system with a collection solid angle above 0.45 srad."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effect of MoO3 preparation methods,"3.1 Effect of MoO3 preparation methods Generally, crystalline MoO3 has three polymorphs: the thermodynamically stable orthorhombic phase (α-MoO3) and two metastable phases, the monoclinic phase (β-MoO3) and the hexagonal phase (h-MoO3) [34]. XRD patterns in Fig. 1 a showed mainly α-MoO3 diffraction peaks for all samples. For details in Fig. 1b, the MoO3 made by CM was orthorhombic phase with typical signals at about 23.3, 25.7 and 27.3°, representing the (110), (040) and (021) reflections, respectively (PDF#035–0609). However, the corresponding peaks of MoO3-Com and MoO3-FSP shifted to high angles, indicating the existence of mixture orthorhombic and monoclinic phases. Moreover, a small typical reflection of MoO2 at 2θ = 26.1° was found in MoO3-FSP sample. Based on the line broadening of the peak at 27.3°, we calculated the average MoO3 nanoparticle size using the Scherrer equation, showing 109, 109 and 41 nm for MoO3 made by Com, CM and FSP, respectively. Fig. 1c showed that hexagonal β-Mo2C was the only Mo carbide product that observed after TPC of MoO3 as reported before [4,23], presenting a defined XRD diffractograms with narrow signals at 34.5, 37.9 and 39.5° (PDF#011–0680). After carbonization, the particle sizes of the corresponding β-Mo2C samples are 26, 24 and 15 nm, respectively, according to the peak at 39.5° in Fig. 1d. The one made by FSP method showed metastable phases in Mo oxides and much smaller particle size in both oxidized and carbonized states, owing to the quenching process from extremely high temperature [32]. As shown in Fig. 2 , the CO conversion of β-Mo2C-FSP increased with increasing temperature until 300℃ and reached the highest value of 22.7% , exhibiting higher activity compared to β-Mo2C-Com and β-Mo2C-CM catalysts (about 5%), which was probably attributed to its smaller particle size and higher specific area."
7,Effects of metals on MoO3,"3.2 Effects of metals on MoO3 Various metals, such as Au, Pt, Rh and Cu, were deposited on FSP-made MoO3 nanoparticles by wetness impregnation method. The effect of the amount and properties of supported metals on carbonization process and the crystal phase of carbides were investigated. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the CO conversion remarkably increased with increasing reaction temperature and then decreased at higher temperature due to deactivation of carbides [7,15,35,36]. For pure β-Mo2C from metal-free MoO3, the highest activity showed at 300 ℃, while this temperature was declined to 200℃ by metals addition. To be specific, trace Rh (0.025 wt%) supported on MoO3 can dramatically enhance the catalytic activity of Mo carbides at low temperature, reaching a CO conversion of 96.8% at 200℃. Likewise, 0.025 wt% Pt could also enhance the CO conversion to 88.2% at 200℃. However, compared to pure β-Mo2C, no obvious positive function can be found with the same amount of Au. It revealed that catalytic activity was sensitive to the amount of Au, since high loading of Au (2 wt%) was confirmed to be efficient for the enhancement of catalytic performance [15,22]. In order to figure out the effect of metal loadings, 2 wt% Rh/MoC x was synthesized in the same method. It not only showed the highest activity at 200℃, but also kept at a high level even further increasing temperature to 350℃, exhibiting high stability compared to others. For Cu, as high as 5 wt% metal loading was still not enough to reach the same activity of trace Rh. To evaluate the metal efficiency, the reaction was performed at a high space velocity (120000 mL·gcat −1·h−1) to obtain nearly complete conversion. As shown in Fig. 3b, extremely high metal efficiency can be obtained via adding trace Rh. Metal normalized hydrogen production rates reached to 212.7 mmol H2·gmetal −1·s−1 over Rh/MoC x catalyst, which was more than one order of magnitude higher than that for Au and two orders for Cu based Mo carbides, revealing that Rh was more active and promising in promoting α-MoC1- x formation. It was also higher than the same loading Pt/MoC x (155.2 mmol H2·gmetal −1·s−1). These results significantly exhibited advantages compared to Pt/β-Mo2C, Pt/α-MoC1- x and Au/α-MoC1- x catalysts as reported in literatures [15,23,24] with the hydrogen production rates of 5.8, 112.9 and 16.3 mmol H2·gmetal −1·s−1, respectively. Moreover, no sign of linear relationship can be observed between activity and Rh loading, which was caused by the contribution of Mo carbides in activity. XRD patterns in Fig. 4 a showed that the phase of MoC x in supported 0.025% Au catalyst was dominated by β-Mo2C, the same as the one without metals. Supported Pt, Rh and Cu on MoO3 can induce the formation of α-MoC1- x at different extents. The phase of carbides in 2% Rh/MoC x was almost pure α-MoC1- x . A little β-Mo2C can be observed on those with 0.025% Rh and 5% Cu, while more β-Mo2C were formed on 2% Pt/MoC x . These results showed that the supported metals have a great effect on the phase of Mo carbides and could further enhance catalytic activity via promoting the formation of α-MoC1- x which has a better activity than β-Mo2C in WGS [15]. The control of metals on phase transfer of Mo carbides was supposed to attribute to the ability of metals in the activation of H2 and CH4 during carbonization process, resulting in the decrease of reduction temperature of MoO3 and the variation of intermediate phase of carbides. From TPR analysis in Fig. 4b, 0.025% Au on MoO3 had no effect on the oxide reduction, while Pt, Rh and Cu addition dramatically declined the reduction temperature, which were in consistence with the catalytic activity. Besides, the addition of inactive metals, such as La, Ba and Na, on Mo carbides also have great effects on MoO3 carbonization. They can give positive or negative effects, which depended on the nature property of metals and the interactions between metals and Mo species. La additive improved the catalytic performance of Mo carbide, but Ba and Na deactivated the catalysts as shown in Figs. S1 and S2."
8,Catalytic stability in WGS,"3.4 Catalytic stability in WGS In general, it is inevitable to form surface oxycarbides via oxygen decoration on carbide catalysts in an oxygen-containing environment [7]. The adsorbed OH or surface oxygen species will lead to deep oxidation and deactivation of the carbides. Mo carbides always suffers from being oxidized by H2O in WGS reaction at high temperature, losing their ability in activate H2O [7,35,36]. We tested the catalytic stability of α-MoC1- x and two Rh/MoC x samples with 0.025 and 2% Rh loadings at 300 ℃. As shown in Fig. 5 a, the CO conversion of α-MoC1- x reduced from 58% to less than 5% at a 9 h test of WGS reaction, which was similar to the trend for 0.025% Rh/MoC x , indicating that trace Rh was able to control phase transfer but had no contribution to catalytic stability. In contrast, both activity and stability were significantly improved when increasing Rh loading from 0.025 to 2%. The CO conversion of 2% Rh/MoC x was only reduced from 96 to 70% in 13 h in continuous WGS reaction at 300℃. XRD patterns in Fig. 5b showed that, for all of the three samples, cubic α-MoC1- x with a defined XRD signals at 36.4 and 42.3° (PDF#089-2868) was still dominated even after WGS reaction. From the details, a small amount of phase transfer to β-Mo2C during reaction was observed on α-MoC1- x , indicating that not only oxidation but also phase transfer happened. However, no sign of phase transfer can be detected for those with Rh. Since surface oxycarbides cannot be detected by XRD, more efficient characterizations should be conducted. The surface composition of Rh/MoC x with different loadings and their variations during reaction were analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). For all samples, the binding energies of Mo 3d 5/2 and Mo 3d 3/2 were separated by 3.2 eV with a peak area ratio of 3/2. In Fig. 6 a and b, the peaks at 235.9 and 232.9 eV were assigned to the 3d 3/2 and 3d 5/2 of Mo6+ in MoO3 [37–39], respectively, while the one at 229.7 eV were derived from Mo4+ in MoO2 [38,39]. The peaks at 228.5 eV can be assigned to Mo2+ in β-Mo2C [37,40]. Peaks position and their percentage for MoO3 before carbonization and Rh/MoC x after stability tests were listed in Table 1 . For MoO3, 83% Mo6+ and 17% Mo4+ can be found, indicating the formation of unsaturated Mo oxides and oxygen vacancies. Once oxygen is removed from the structure and a sufficient number of oxygen vacancies created, the MoO3 lattice can easily rearrange from a corner-sharing to an edge-sharing octahedral structure [38], which facilitated the following incorporation of carbon atoms by directly exchanging with oxygen atoms or by filling anionic vacancies [41]. Compared to 0.025% Rh/MoC x , the amount of Mo6+ and Mo4+ species in 2% Rh/MoC x catalyst was decreased from 21 to 14 % and from 47 to 28 %, respectively. And the total percentage of Mo carbides increased from 32 to 58%. Those results indicated that the oxidation of Mo carbides by H2O during reaction was greatly inhibited by 2% Rh, probably due to the strong charge transfer from Rh to Mo carbides since a 0.1 eV shift to low energy was detected on the Mo 3d peak of 2% Rh/MoC x . Moreover, C 1s spectra for the used 0.025% Rh/MoC x and 2% Rh/MoC x catalysts were shown in Fig. 6c and d, respectively. The peak at about 283.5 eV were assigned to carbidic carbon in hexagonal Mo2C [40]. Compared to 0.025% Rh/MoC x , the final ratio of Mo/C of used 2% Rh/MoC x catalyst was decreased from 2.0 to 1.5, which also confirmed that the latter was more efficient in lowing the oxidation degree at the same reaction conditions. Thus, high-content Rh on Mo carbides could inhibit the formation of Mo oxides and further enhance the stability in WGS reaction. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of reduced and carbonized 2% Rh/MoO3 were conducted here to show the variation of Rh particles during carbonization. Fig. 7 a-b showed that Rh nanoparticles were well dispersed on MoO3 supports in both 2% Rh/MoO3-H2 and 2% Rh/MoC x samples. According to statistics, the average Rh particle size of 2% Rh/MoO3-H2 and 2% Rh/MoC x samples were 5.5 and 1.8 nm, respectively. It revealed that a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) was formed between Rh and Mo carbides as reported [22], making Rh nanoparticles re-disperse during high temperature carbonization process and thus performing a high initial activity in WGS reaction. The EDX element mapping images of Rh/MoO3-H2 and 2% Rh/MoC x samples in Fig. 7c-d and Fig. S3 showed that Mo, O and Rh atoms were homogeneously distributed over the whole sample surface."
9,Conclusions,"FSP-made MoO3 showed the smallest particles size and the best performance compared to the commercial and calcination made samples. Metals supported on MoO3 have great effect on the phase transformation and catalytic performance of Mo carbides, not only playing an important role on carbonization process, but also enhancing the catalytic activity and stability in WGS reaction. MoO3 with trace Rh (0.025 wt%) were able to transfer into α-MoC1- x in one-step carbonization, while only β-Mo2C can be formed without metals or with the same amount of Au at the same conditions. 0.025% Pt addition will produce mixed α and β phases. α-MoC1- x can also be obtained by loading Cu, but even as much as 5% loading content cannot reach the level as 0.025% Rh. 0.025% Rh/MoC x catalyst showed extremely high metal utilization and metal normalized hydrogen production rate of 213 mmol H2·gmetal −1·s−1, which was much higher than those on Pt and Au based Mo carbides (113 and 16 mmol H2·gmetal −1·s−1, respectively) ever reported. In addition, the one with 2% Rh exhibited both high activity and stability in WGS reaction at 300 °C. It was attributed to the re-dispersion effect of SMSI between Rh and Mo carbide support and the inhibition of Rh on the oxidation of carbides by H2O. Moreover, inactive metals can give positive or negative effects, which depended on the nature property of metals. The above study demonstrates the feasibility of using metals to control phase transfer of Mo carbides and greatly improve catalytic performance in aspects of both activity and stability, providing a guide for producing different Mo carbides phases by supported metals for future researches."
