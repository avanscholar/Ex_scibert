0,Introduction,"The rise of industrial activities from last century causes production of large volumes of wastewater containing various hazardous pollutants. Among them, dyestuff materials are main hazardous species and attracted widespread concerns due to their harmful effects on the environment and human health [1]. Hence, the treatment of dye wastes is necessary. To date, many approaches such as physical methods, chemical technologies, biological treatments, and photocatalytic degradation processes have been reported for decolorization of wastewater. Among these methods, adsorption is the most attractive method for removal of dye residues from wastewater because of its relatively high efficiency, low cost, simple design, and ease of operation [2,3]. Therefore, many cost effective and traditional adsorbents, such as activated carbon [4,5], rice husk ash [6], glass wool [7], clay minerals [8–10], silica [14], and others have been developed for dye adsorption from wastewater. However, most of these adsorbents suffer from the low dye adsorption capacity, high-cost, and recycle ability, which severely limit their widespread application as remediation tools. Hence, there is an urgent need for designing novel efficient dye waste adsorbents with high adsorption capacity, low cost, and recyclability. Recently, the eco-friendly adsorbents based on biopolymers for effective removal of organic dyes are greatly concerned [8–18]. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a biodegradable, biocompatible, and relatively low-cost polymer. It has a long history of safe use in pharmaceutical and biomedical industries [19]. However, to date, the application of PVA for wastewater treatment is rare in the literature, mainly due to its low stability in water and insufficient interaction of the hydroxyl groups on PVA with dye moeities [20]. Hence, the main goal of our present investigation is to exploit PVA for dye removal application by chelation of its hydroxyl groups with Fe(III) ions. There are few reports in the literature on the use of Fe(III) chelated chitosan for removal of contaminants from aqueous solution through chelation between anionic pollutants and Fe(III) centers [21–25]. Mahanta and coworkers have fabricated electrospun nanofibers based on PVA/Fe(III) complex for the removal of arsenic species from wastewater [24]. However, such biopolymer complexes are still faced with some problems such as relatively low adsorption capacity or large decline in dye removal performance in alkaline solutions. In order to overcome these drawbacks, herein we introduced chitin nanofibers (NFs) into the PVA/Fe(III) complex. Chitin is a low-cost and second most abundant natural biopolymer and has advantages such as biocompatibility and biodegradability [26]. Moreover, chitin biopolymer is stable in most common solvents owning its rigid crystalline structure [27]. On the other hand, chitin NFs have been utilized as effective reinforcing agents of PVA [28,29]. Furthermore, chitin can be considered as a promising bioadsorbent to adsorb both anionic and cationic pollutants from water [30–37]. Therefore, the incorporation of chitin NFs into PVA not only can enhance the stability of PVA/Fe(III) in various aqueous solutions through electrostatic intermolecular interactions, but also can effectively participate in the dye adsorption process. Hence, the aim of this study is to explore and prepare PVA/Fe(III) bionanocomposites containing chitin NFs demonstrating high adsorption capacity toward methyl orange (MO), as a representative of common anionic dyes. Based on our knowledge, this is the first report on utilization of Fe(III) crosslinked PVA for dye removal application. The structure and morphology of the developed bioadsorbents were characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. The effects of Fe(III) content and chitin NFs incorporation on the dye removal efficiency of adsorbents were investigated. The adsorption influencing parameters such as solution pH, contact time and initial dye concentration were optimized for maximum MO adsorption. The kinetics and isotherms as well as thermodynamics of dye adsorption process were also thoroughly studied. Moreover, the regeneration experiments were conducted to verify the potential reusability and reliability. Finally, the possible mechanism for dye adsorption-desorption was proposed, which may also be used to account for the observed high efficiency of dye removal by PVA/chitin NFs/Fe(III) complex."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) with Mw ∼ 70,000 g/mol and degree of hydrolysis ≥85% was purchased from Merck Co. (Germany). Chitin nanofibers (NFs) suspension with 2 wt% solid content was purchased from Nano Novin Polymer Co. (Sari, Iran). FeCl3 (98%), methyl orange (97%) and ammonia solution (25%) were obtained from Merck Co. (Germany). All other chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received."
3,Preparation of adsorbents,"2.2 Preparation of adsorbents First, a homogeneous solution of PVA (8 wt%) was prepared by dissolving a desired amount of PVA in 50 mL distilled water at ∼95 °C under vigorous stirring for 2 h. Subsequently, chitin NFs solution (with a PVA/chitin weigh ratio of 1:1) was poured into the PVA solution and stirred at room temperature for 1 h, and then sonicated using a ultrasonic homogenizer (Development of Ultrasonic Technology Co., Iran) for 5 min. Afterward, a predetermined amount of FeCl3 was added to the PVA/chitin NFs suspension and dissolved by stirring for another 1 h at room temperature. The solution was poured into petri dishes and dried at room temperature for 48 h. Finally, the resultant samples were kept in a desiccator containing concentrated liquid ammonia for 24 h to ensure complete cross-linking [38]. Subsequently, the samples were thoroughly rinsed with distilled water, dried, and used for experimental works. PVA-chitin NFs-Fe(III) adsorbents containing 10, 20, 30 and 40 wt% FeCl3 were prepared and designated as PVA-Chitin-Fe10, PVA-Chitin-Fe20, PVA-Chitin-Fe30 and PVA-Chitin-Fe40, respectively. For comparison, PVA/FeCl3 adsorbents were also prepared with the same procedure, except no chitin NFs were added, and designated as PVA-Fe10, PVA-Fe20, PVA-Fe30 and PVA-Fe40."
4,Characterization of adsorbents,"2.3 Characterization of adsorbents For FTIR analysis, the samples were dried, grinded and mixed with dry KBr powder, and their pellets were prepared. Then, FTIR (Shimadzu 8400S, Japan) spectra were recorded. Wide angle XRD analysis was conducted by using a JEOL X-ray diffractometer (JDX-8030, Japan) with CuKa radiation operating at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 44 mA. Micrographs of the cross-section of samples were taken by using field emission scanning electron microscope coupled with an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (MIRA3 FE-SEM, Tescan, Czech). Samples were gold-sputtered before SEM investigations."
5,Adsorption investigations,"2.4 Adsorption investigations For the dye adsorption experiments, aqueous solution of MO (as a model anionic dye) was prepared. The initial pH of the dye solutions was adjusted from 4 to 8 by dropwise addition of 0.1 M NaOH or 0.1 M HCl to study the effect of initial dye solution pH on the dye removal efficiency. Adsorption kinetics and isotherms were investigated by adding 2.5 mg of adsorbent into 25 mL MO solution with initial dye concentrations (C0) of 10, 50 and 100 mg/L. The mixture was agitated by means of a shaker (120 rpm) at 27 °C until equilibrium was achieved. At predetermined time intervals, the amount of dye adsorption was determined using a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu-1800, Japan) according to the standard curve at λmax = 461 nm. The adsorption capacity (q) of MO dye onto adsorbents was determined by the following equation: (1) q t = C 0 − C t V m where qt (mg·g−1) is the absorption amount of dye at time t, C0 (mg·L−1) and Ct (mg·L−1) indicate the initial dye concentration and the concentration of dye at time t, respectively. V (L) is the volume of solution, and m (g) stands for the mass of the adsorbent. All adsorption experiments were done in triplicate, and the average value was reported."
6,Desorption and recycling experiment,"2.5 Desorption and recycling experiment For desorption study, the dye-adsorbed composite was first washed thoroughly with deionized water for the removal of any unadsorbed dye. Then the MO-adsorbed sample was put into 50 mL desorption solution, 0.1 M NaOH/ethanol (50/50 V/V), and shaken (120 rpm) for 24 h. Finally, the concentration of MO in the desorption solution was measured to obtain the amount of MO desorbed. To investigate the reusability of the adsorbent, the sample was rinsed with 0.01 M HCl to regenerate the adsorbent. Afterward, it was dried and reused for the next adsorption experiments (C0 = 50 mg/L, adsorbent dose = 1 g/L and T = 27 °C), and the process was repeated 5 times."
7,Point of zero charge,"2.6 Point of zero charge The pH at the point of zero charge (pHpzc) of adsorbents was measured through batch equilibration method [39]. KCl solution (0.1 M) was utilized as the electrolyte, and the ionic strength of solution was kept constant during all experiments. Initial pH of solutions (pHinitial) was first adjusted from 4 to 8 by either 0.1 M HCl or 0.1 M NaOH. Subsequently, 50 mg of adsorbent was added into 20 mL KCl solution and shaken (100 rpm) for 48 h at 27 °C. Finally, the adsorbent was removed from solution and the final pH value of solution (pHfinal) was measured. The pHpzc of each adsorbent was obtained by plotting of ΔpH (pHfinal – pHinitial) versus pHinitial."
8,Swelling measurements,"2.7 Swelling measurements Swelling degree was determined by immersing 0.1 g of dry adsorbent in 30 mL distilled water and shaking (100 rpm) for 24 h at 27 °C. At predetermined intervals, samples were wiped with tissue paper to remove excessive surface water and the weight of swollen samples was measured. Then, the swelling ratio was calculated using the following equation: (2) Swelling Ratio = W s − W d W d where Ws and Wd are the weight of swollen and dry samples, respectively. The pH of solutions was adjusted by adding 0.1 M HCl or 0.1 M NaOH solution."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Characterization of adsorbents,"3.1 Characterization of adsorbents 3.1.1 FTIR spectroscopy The FT-IR spectra of PVA, chitin NFs, PVA-Chit and PVA-Chit-Fe30 are presented in Fig. 1 . In the spectrum of neat chitin, the absorptions at 1651, 1562 and 1319 cm−1 are characteristic peaks of chitin, and assigned to amide I (CONH), amide II and amide III bands, respectively [40]. In addition, three peaks appeared at 3483, 3267 and 3101 cm−1 representing the stretching vibrations of OH and CH2OH groups, NH2, and NH of secondary amides, respectively [41]. In the spectrum of neat PVA, the CO of residual acetyl groups on the PVA molecular chains exhibited a peak at 1660 cm−1. In addition, a wide absorption peak at 3450–3800 cm−1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of OH groups presented on PVA [42,43]. This band is noticeably shifted to a lower region in the presence of chitin NFs. Furthermore, the amide I band of chitin NFs is shifted to a lower frequency (from 1651 to 1622 cm−1) in PVA-Chit nanocomposite as compared to the neat chitin. These changes can be ascribed to the formation of an intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the OH groups of PVA and OH/amide function groups of chitin [44]. In the spectrum of PVA-Chit-Fe30, the NH band of secondary amide of chitin at 3101 cm−1 is disappeared and the absorption band of amide I is overlapped with the acetyl group band of PVA due to the presence of Fe3+ ions. In addition, the deformation of alcohol groups at 1375 cm−1 and the CO bands from the secondary alcohol groups in the range of 1050–1170 cm−1 are suppressed in PVA-Chit-Fe30. These changes could be indicative of the fact that both the amide and the hydroxyl groups have participated in the coordination with the Fe3+ ions [23,45]. 3.1.2 Microstructure analyses The XRD patterns of PVA, chitin NFs and PVA-Chit-Fe30 adsorbents are compared in Fig. 2 . The pattern of neat PVA exhibited a peak centering at 2θ = 19.5°, ascribed to the (101) crystal plane of PVA [46,47]. The typical diffraction peaks of neat chitin NFs observed at 2θ = 19.2, 20.7 and 23.2°, ascribed to the (110), (120) and (130) crystal planes of chitin [28,29]. In the diffraction profile of PVA-Chit-Fe30 nanocomposite, the diffraction of (110) and (120) planes of chitin NFs overlapped with the (110) plane of PVA and, as a result, a single diffraction peak observed at 19.3°. Besides that, the (130) crystal plane of chitin can be seen in the diffraction pattern of PVA-Chit-Fe30 nanocomposite. These results indicate that chitin NFs retained their crystalline structure in nanocomposite [48]. The morphology and dispersion state of chitin NFs in the PVA matrix are investigated by SEM. Nanofibers with ca. 20–60 nm in width and several hundred nanometers in length are seen in the SEM image of neat chitin NFs (Fig. 3 (a)). Moreover, typical cross-section SEM micrographs of PVA-Chit-Fe30 nanocomposite with different magnifications are shown in Fig. 3(b) to (d). The nanocomposite displayed a rough and irregular fracture section with some porosity within the material, which would be favorable for dye adsorption application. Under high magnification, it can be seen from Fig. 3(d) that there are some bright spots (indicated by arrows) on the fracture surface of sample, representing the end of chitin NFs in the PVA matrix. However, the diameter of bright spots in composite is higher than that of pristine chitin NFs. This could be originated from the formation of some agglomerates between chitin NFs during composite preparation process. Moreover, no separation between chitin NFs and PVA was observed in Fig. 3(d), which could be indicative of good interaction between the filler and matrix. Intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the functional groups on PVA and chitin NFs (as confirmed by FTIR) increased the compatibility between these two materials and thus facilitated the dispersion of the nanofibers in the PVA matrix. Moreover, EDX map presented in Fig. 4 with the mapping of N and Fe elements provides evidence for the uniform distribution of chitin NFs and Fe3+ ions thorough the PVA matrix, respectively."
11,Swelling studies,"3.2 Swelling studies To study the effect of environmental condition on the swelling behavior of adsorbents, they were immersed in solutions with pH = 4, 6 and 8, and the obtained results are shown in Fig. 5 . Generally, the prepared samples show low swelling capability, which is beneficial for dye removal application. Moreover, the swelling ratio of PVA-Fe30 is slightly increased with raising pH, which may be originated from partial hydrolysis of Fe3+ complex into Fe(OH)2 + and/or Fe(OH)2+ in alkaline solutions [49]. In addition, the swelling ratio of PVA-Chit-Fe30 nanocomposite was found to be slightly lower than that of PVA-Fe30 at all the investigated pHs. The incorporated chitin NFs can act as additional net-points through intermolecular hydrogen bonding with PVA and thus reduce water uptake amount of PVA-Chit-Fe30 adsorbent."
12,Adsorption studies,"3.3 Adsorption studies 3.3.1 Effects of chitin NFs loading and Fe(III) content on dye removal efficiency The effects of chitin NFs incorporation and Fe(III) content on the MO removal were investigated and the obtained results are shown in Fig. 6 . It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the dye removal efficiency of all adsorbents containing chitin NFs is higher than that of their corresponding unfilled ones, which reveals that chitin NFs have effectively participated in dye removal process. This is consistent with previous works which have shown that chitin NFs have a good capability of pollutant removal from wastewater [31–33,35]. Moreover, it is evident from Fig. 6 that the raising FeCl3 content from 10 to 30% caused a noticeable increment in the dye removal efficiency of both the PVA-Fe and PVA-Chit-Fe adsorbents, as PVA-Fe30 and PVA-Chit-Fe30 demonstrated dye removal amounts of 79.1 and 94.2%, respectively. The number of active positive sites increases with raising FeCl3 content in the adsorbents and, as a result, the removal efficiency of the negatively charged MO dye by adsorbents increased. Moreover, it was observed that further increment in the FeCl3 content led to a decrease in the MO removal capability of adsorbents, which might be attributed to the presence of excess and non-complexed Fe3+ ions in the matrix at high concentration. As the maximum dye removal was obtained at FeCl3 content of 30%, unless otherwise stated, below we mainly focused on PVA-Fe30 and PVA-Chit-Fe30 adsorbents for further dye adsorption studies. 3.3.2 Effect of solution pH on dye removal efficiency The pH of dye solution plays an important role in dye removal process. Because it influences the neat surface charge of both adsorbent and dye, and hence increases or reduces the dye removal efficiency of an adsorbent [50]. Therefore, herein, the effect of variation of initial solution pH (4, 6 and 8) on the MO removal efficiency of the prepared adsorbents was investigated and presented in Fig. 7 (a). It is evident from Fig. 7(a) that the dye removal efficiency of both adsorbents, especially, PVA-Fe30, enhanced with the change of dye solution pH from 8 to 4. The increase in the dye removal efficiency with decreasing the solution pH can be explained by the electrostatic interactions between MO species and polymeric matrix. The pHpzc of PVA-Fe30 and PVA-Chitin-Fe30 adsorbents was determined and found to be 6.65 and 6.81, respectively (Fig. 7(b)). When the pH of solution is reduced to a value lower than pHpzc, the neat surface charge of adsorbents becomes positive and attractive electrostatic interactions occurs between the anionic MO dye and positively charged centers on the surface of adsorbents and, correspondingly the dye removal efficiency of the adsorbents increases with reducing the pH of solution. On the other hand, unlike PVA-Chit-Fe30 adsorbent, PVA-Fe30 exhibited a large decline of dye removal efficiency in alkaline solution. This indicates that the incorporation of chitin NFs enhanced the stability and dye removal capability of PVA/Fe(III) complex, especially in alkaline media. 3.3.3 Effect of contact time and kinetic models The adsorption capacity of samples as a function of time at initial MO concentrations of 10, 50 and 100 mg/g are shown in Fig. 8 . It can be seen that with increasing initial MO concentration from 10 to 100 mg/L, the amount of dye adsorbed per unit mass of both the adsorbents was noticeably increased. This can be originated from overcoming diffusion resistance and increasing electrostatic attractions between the adsorbate species and adsorbent at high concentrations of dye solution [51]. Furthermore, it is evident from Fig. 8 that the adsorption rate of MO on the adsorbents was significantly increased in the presence of chitin NFs. As the dye adsorption process on PVA-Chitin-Fe30 adsorbent was mostly accomplished within 60 min contact time, while it was continued for 480 min in the case of PVA-Fe30 adsorbent. The faster MO adsorption by PVA-Chitin-Fe30 could be ascribed to the presence of a large surface area and a high number of active sites on chitin NFs providing an additional dye adsorption mechanism besides the PVA/Fe(III) complex adsorbent. The kinetics of adsorption were investigated by fitting the experimental equilibrium data on Lagergren's pseudo-first-order [52], pseudo-second-order [53] and intraparticle diffusion [54] kinetics models. The nonlinear form of pseudo-first-order model was written as follows: (3) q t = q e 1 − exp − k 1 t where qe (mg/g) and qt (mg/g) stand for the adsorption capacity at equilibrium time and at the time of t (min), and k1 (1/min) is the rate constant of first-order kinetics. The nonlinear form of the pseudo-second-order kinetic model was expressed as follows: (4) q t = q e 2 k 2 t 1 + q e k 2 t where k2 (g/mg·min) indicates the rate constant of pseudo-second-order equilibrium. Fig. 8(a) and (b) demonstrates the fitting curves of pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetics models for MO adsorption by adsorbents in different initial dye contents. In addition, the obtained parameters from the fitting data on these kinetics models are listed in Table 1 . It can be seen that the obtained regression coefficient values from the pseudo-second-order kinetics (R2 > 0.98) for both adsorbents at all the investigated dye concentrations are higher than those obtained from the first-order kinetics (R2 > 0.93). In addition, the qe values calculated from the pseudo-second-order model are much closer to the experimental values. Therefore, these results reveal that adsorption process of MO dye onto the prepared adsorbents can be well described with the pseudo-second-order kinetics. The possibility of intraparticle diffusion resistance affecting adsorption was studied by the intraparticle diffusion model and expressed as follows: (5) q t = k di t 0.5 + C i where kdi and Ci are the rate constant of intraparticle diffusion model and intercept, respectively. According to intraparticle diffusion model, the plot of qt versus of t0.5 should be linear and pass through the origin in order for the intraparticle diffusion to be a rate limiting step. The plot and its corresponding parameters are shown in Fig. 9 and Table 2 , respectively. It can be obviously seen that the plots of MO adsorption on the both adsorbents are not linear within the investigated period of time but could be divided into two linear regions. The first observed linear region could be correlated to boundary layer diffusion. The second linear region is the equilibrium state of the dye adsorption process. In the first step, MO species were quickly adsorbed on the surface of adsorbents followed by their gradual penetration into the micropores of adsorbents and reaching to an equilibrium state [55]. 3.3.4 Adsorption isotherms Two common isotherm models, i.e. Langmuir and Freundlich, were used to determine the adsorption isotherm parameters [56]. The non-linear Langmuir isotherm equation is expressed by [56]: (6) q e = q m K L C e 1 + K L C e where qe is adsorption capacity in equilibrium state (mg/g), qm is the maximum adsorption capacity (mg/g), Ce is the equilibrium concentration of dye (mg/L) and KL is the Langmuir constant correlated to the adsorption equilibrium (L/mg). The Freundlich isotherm equation is written as follows: (7) q e = K F C e 1 / n where KF (mg/g) and n are the Freundlich constants and indicate adsorption capacity at unit concentration and adsorption intensity, respectively [57]. Both KF and n can predict the feasibility of dye adsorption process. The parameters of Langmuir (KL and qm) and Freundlich (KF and 1/n) isotherms as well as the regression coefficients (R 2 ) for the MO adsorption by PVA-Fe30 and PVA-Chitin-Fe30 adsorbents are calculated and listed in Table 3 . Furthermore, the fitting plots of experimental data on these models are displayed in Fig. 10 . The regression coefficient values demonstrated that the Freundlich model (R2 > 0.97) fitted better than the Langmuir model (R2 > 0.95), which revealed the monolayer adsorption and homogeneous surface of the PVA-Fe30 and PVA-Chitin-Fe30 adsorbents [57,58]. Based on Freundlich model, the 1/n values of 0.696 and 0.667 were obtained for PVA-Fe30 and PVA-Chitin-Fe30 adsorbents, respectively, which are below 1 and indicate that the normal Langmuir isotherm is favorable [5]. In addition, according to Langmuir fitting, PVA-Chitin-Fe30 nanocomposite exhibited a high maximum adsorption capacity (qmax) value of 810.4 mg/g for MO adsorption, which is very prominent compared with other related adsorbents reported in the literature, as listed in Table 4 . The high capacity with fast adsorption kinetics implies that PVA-Chitin-Fe30 adsorbent is highly competitive as an effective adsorbent for dye removal applications. 3.3.5 Adsorption thermodynamics The thermodynamic behavior of the MO dye on the developed adsorbents was studied at temperatures of 300, 310 and 320 K. The thermodynamic parameters of the enthalpy (ΔH), entropy (ΔS) and standard Gibb's free energy (ΔG) were calculated using Eqs. (8) and (9). (8) ∆ G = − RT ln K d (9) Ln K d = ∆ S R − ∆ H RT where R (8.314 J mol−1 K−1), T (K) and Kd are gas constant, temperature and equilibrium constant, respectively. Kd can be calculated through Eq. (10). (10) K d = q e C e where Ce (mg/L) and qe (mg/g) are equilibrium concentration of adsorbate in aqueous solution and equilibrium uptake amount of adsorbate, respectively. By plotting of lnKd as a function of 1/T, the ΔH and ΔS values can be obtained from the slope and intercept of plot, respectively (Fig. 11 ). It can be seen from Table 5 that the ΔG values at the three investigated temperatures are negative, indicating spontaneous nature of the MO adsorption process on the adsorbents. Moreover, ΔG is more negative at lower temperatures, revealing that the MO adsorption process is favored with decreasing temperature. 3.3.6 Regeneration studies Desorption experiments were performed in 0.1 M NaOH/ethanol (50/50 V/V), on PVA-Chitin-Fe30 and results are shown in Fig. 12 . Reuse experiments exhibits that the adsorption efficiency of the PVA-Chitin-Fe30 adsorbent remained almost constant during five cycles of adsorption/desorption, indicating that the adsorption sites on the surface of the adsorbent are mostly reversible [21]. 3.3.7 Possible adsorption/desorption mechanisms Overall, the main possible mechanism for the efficient dye adsorption of PVA-Fe adsorbent under acidic condition (i.e. pH = 4) is proposed to be ligand or ion-exchange between the Fe3+ metal centers and MO, as schematically demonstrated in Fig. 13 (a). The hydroxyl groups of PVA have formed a chelated complex with the Fe3+ ions similar to that of Fe3+ in chitosan [21,22,38]. Ghemati and coworkers have obtained a maximum adsorption capacity of 44.6 mg/g for glutaraldehyde crosslinked PVA toward MO dye [64], which indicates that the crosslinking of PVA with Fe(III) led to noticeable increment in the dye adsorption capacity, as PVA-Fe30 demonstrated qmax value of 593.5 mg/g (Table 4). We speculated that when the PVA-Fe(III) adsorbent was added to the aqueous dye solution with pH = 4, the free dye molecules containing sulfonate groups with negative charges (pKa > 3.47) [65], could change places with the water molecules in the polymer-Fe(III) complex to chelate the Fe(III) center in the adsorbent [66,67], causing their high adsorption capacity (Fig. 13(a)). However, with increasing the pH of dye solution, OH− ions would compete with the anionic MO dye molecules for the adsorption sites [67], and, as a result, the dye removal efficiency was reduced. For instance, that the dye removal efficiencies of PVA-Fe30 and PVA-Chitin-Fe30 adsorbents were decreased from 79.0 and 94.1 to 40.8 and 85.1%, respectively, with the change of dye solution pH from 8 to 4 (Fig. 7(a)). Moreover, as seen in Fig. 7(a), the dye removal efficiency was noticeably increased in the presence of chitin NFs at all investigated pHs, indicating that there is an additional dye adsorption mechanism through the chitin NFs. For instance, the dye removal efficiency of PVA-Fe30 at pH = 4 was increased from 79.0 to 94.1% in the presence of chitin NFs. It has been reported that the hydrous and positively charged transition metal ions can interact with the N atom of N-acetyl and OH groups on the surface of chitin NFs [21,68], as schematically shown in Fig. 13(b). Subsequently, the negatively charged MO can occupy the place of water molecules coordinated in Fe(III) complex during the dye adsorption process. Ma and coworkers have also reported that the ligand exchange becomes the predominant mechanism with the increase of the solution pH, and attributed it to decrease in the number of positively charged sites or even creation of some negatively charged centers on the surface of chitosan/Fe (III) hydrogel with the raising pH of dye solution [25]. The pKa of the chitin N-acetyl groups was reported to be 6.1 [33]. At pHs below the pKa of the chitin, the N-acetyl groups of chitin are positively charged and, hence the main possible mechanism for MO adsorption by chitin NFs at pH < pKa can be electrostatic interactions between the positively charged chitin NFs and the negatively charged adsorbate [33,36,66] (Fig. 13(c)), which led to a high dye removal of adsorbent in the presence of chitin NFs, especially in acidic solution (as seen in Fig. 7(a)). A similar result has been reported in the adsorption of tartrazine onto chitin/chitosan adsorbents. In that study, the pH decrease from 11 to 3 led to a significant increase in the dye adsorption capacity, which was attributed to the enhanced electrostatic attraction between the tartrazine sulfonated groups and the protonated amino groups of chitin/chitosan [69]. During the dye desorption process in 0.1 M NaOH/ethanol solution, the adsorbed anionic dye moieties on the polymer/Fe(III) complex would be replaced with OH− ions [21,25]. Meanwhile, the presence of polar solvents such as ethanol can facilitate the dye desorption process [70]. Then, the OH− ions in complex were converted to H2O during treatment with acidic solution, and accordingly polymer-Fe(III) complex was recovered."
13,Conclusion,"In this study, environment-friendly and reusable adsorbents based on Fe(III) crosslinked PVA-chitin NFs composites were successfully prepared for MO adsorption. SEM images exhibited that the prepared bionanocomposite adsorbents have a porous structure and composed of well-dispersed fibrous chitin NFs. Unlike the unfilled PVA-Fe(III), the PVA-chitin NFs-Fe(III) adsorbents could efficiently remove the dye under both acidic and alkaline conditions via the chelation between sulfonic group of dye and Fe(III) centers in adsorbent as well as electrostatic interactions between chitin NFs and the adsorbate. Moreover, it was shown that the PVA-chitin NFs-Fe(III) adsorbent could be regenerated and reused effectively during five cycles of adsorption/desorption. The experimental data were best fitted by pseudo-second-order kinetics model. The adsorption isotherms demonstrated that the Freundlich isotherm is favorable. In addition, maximum adsorption capacity of 593.5 and 810.4 mg/g were obtained for PVA-Fe(III) and PVA-chitin NFs-Fe(III) adsorbents, respectively. The combination of high adsorption capacity and reusability of the developed DN gels, along with their easy, green and low-cost fabrication from the biopolymers, could make them as promising adsorbents for wastewater treatment."
