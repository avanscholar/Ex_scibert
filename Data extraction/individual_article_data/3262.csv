0,Introduction,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as one of the most commonly used oxidants, has a wide range of important applications in environmental remediation, chemical synthesis, paper/pulp industry, medical disinfection and energy carrier [1-6]. Generally, production of H2O2 is almost exclusively manufactured via an anthraquinone process, including consecutive hydrogenation/oxidation of the alkylated anthraquinone intermediate dissolved in an organic solvent [4,7]. The multi-step process requires a considerable energy input and generates a significant amount of liquid waste along with some safety issues [4,7]. The electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 through a two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e- ORR) has become an appealing alternative since it was proposed in 1990, owning to its high safety, low cost and facile operation at mild conditions [6,8,9]. However, a competitive four-electron oxygen reduction (4e- ORR) to water could reduce the yield of H2O2 with a low energy efficiency. The noble metals and their alloys, such as atomically dispersed Pt, bimetallic Pt-Hg and Pd-Hg nanoparticles, have been therefore developed as electrocatalysts for the production of H2O2 with high selectivity and low overpotential, but their high cost and scarcity hindered them from a large-scale application [10-13]. Alternatively, metal-free carbon materials are widely considered as the promising candidates for ORR, owing to their low cost, abundant source, high electrical conductivity and chemically stability [14-16]. Therefore, it is highly desirable to overcome the intrinsic inertness of carbon materials for enhancing oxygen reduction to H2O2. To date, doping carbon with nitrogen (N) atoms has been proven to be an effective strategy to improve carbon catalytic performance, since N dopant can induce positive charge densities on the adjacent carbon atoms [17,18]. For instance, Antonietti and co-workers prepared N-doped mesoporous carbon as an ORR electrocatalyst derived from ionic liquid N-butyl-3-methylpyridinium dicyanamide as precursor by hard-templating strategy using commercial silica nanoparticles, which exhibited a H2O2 Faraday efficiency (FE) of 65.15% in the acidic medium [19]. Pescarmona and co-workers reported that N-doped ordered mesoporous carbon materials derived from aniline and dihydroxynaphthalene via a two-step casting strategy, achieving a high kinetic current density of over − 16.7 mA cm−2 with excellent long-term stability for 2e- ORR toward H2O2 [20]. Fornasiero and co-workers prepared a carbon nanohorn core enveloped within a N-doped carbon shell via polymerization of dopamine and successive annealing, which had about 60% H2O2 selectivity in a wide range of pH [21]. Nevertheless, there is still a big margin to improve the catalytic activity of the heteroatom-doped carbon materials for electrosynthesis of H2O2. Recently, it was found that doping of boron (B) into carboncanalso improve the ORR activity of carbon, in which carbon π electrons are activated by conjugating with the vacant p-orbital of B, thus B species with a positive charge became active sites for ORR [22]. The previous studies also demonstrated that doping both B and N atoms into carbon materials could introduce more active species and adjust the physical and chemical properties of carbon nanomaterials to enhance ORR activity, owing to the different electronegativities of B and N atoms [23-25]. For example, Liu and co-workers reported the B and N co-doped nanodiamond (BND) by using a gas mixture of H2/CH4/B2H6/N2 as raw materials via microwave plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which had a superior 4e- ORR performance, as compared to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst [26]. Xue and co-workers prepared a B, N co-doped graphene foam derived from melamine and boric acid as precursors by thermal CVD method, which showed a higher electrocatalytic activity toward 4e- ORR than their undoped counterparts [27]. Jiang and co-workers synthesized N, B co-doped hollow graphene microspheres (NBGHSs) by employing porous SiO2 spheres as the sacrificing templates, graphene oxide and ammonia boron trifluoride as precursors, and NBGHSs displayed higher activity for the 4e- ORR than the commercial Pt/C [28]. Huang and co-workers prepared ultrathin carbon nanosheet superstructure with high B, N-doping level by using sodium chloride-assisted pyrolysis method, which exhibited good 4e- ORR catalytic activity, comparable to that of commercial Pt/C [29]. Despite the fact that the B and N co-doped carbon materials mentioned above shows excellent catalytic performance toward 4e- ORR comparable to that of noble metals and their alloys, but there are scarce reports regarding their 2e- pathway toward H2O2 production. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop co-effective B, N co-doped porous carbon materials as a highly efficient metal-free electrocatalysts for electrochemical synthesis of H2O2. Furthermore, the electronic structure analysis of active sites in carbon-based catalysts is of critical importance for understanding the origin of ORR activity, which provide a guide to rational design of metal-free carbon materials as efficient catalysts for 2e- ORR. To the bast of our knowledge, there is a lack of in-depth understanding of the electronic structure of B sites coupled with N species for improving ORR activity. Herein, we fabricated B, N co-doped carbon (B/NC) aerogels by cross-linking poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-graphene dispersion withborax, along with the chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline, followed by pyrolysis. The acquired B/NC aerogels possessed three-dimensional (3D) porous structures and the tunable N and B doing level, which can increase their porosity to expose more active sites and enhance mass transport. As expected, the optimized B/NC showed an onset potential of 0.82 V vs. RHE and a 94.16% selectivity toward H2O2 formation at the potential of 0.6 V vs. RHE in alkaline media, superior to those of the only single N-doped counterpart. Based on the characteristic and experimental analyses, it was found that the ORR activity was positively correlated with the hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and pyridinic-N. DFT calculations also uncovered that the hBN combined with neighboring pyridinic-N as active sites can lower the free energy barrier for formation of HOO* intermediate. Importantly, DFT calculations revealed the B atom is the origin of active sites for improving the 2e- ORR activity for production of H2O2."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Graphite powder was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. PVA (Mw = 14,6000 ~ 18,6000), aniline, ammonium persulphate and borax were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Commercial 20% Pt/C and nafion were purchased from Alfa Aesar. All reagents and chemicals were used without further purification."
3,Synthesis of catalysts,"2.2 Synthesis of catalysts The PVA-graphene dispersion was fabricated by liquid-phase exfoliation of graphite, as reported by our previous work [30]. In a typical experiment, 2 mL of graphene-PVA (4 wt%, 0.04 wt% PVA) dispersion and aniline (74.5 mg) were dispersed in 2 mL PVA (5 wt%) aqueous solution to form A. 0.8 mmol APS and a certain amount of borax were dissolved in 4 mL of deionized water to form B. Then A and B were mixed uniformly, and left to stand for 2 h to create a hydrogel. Then, the hydrogel was transferred to a lyophilizer for 48 h of freeze-drying to obtain aerogel. All these aerogel precursors were calcined at 1000 °C under N2 atmosphere for 2 h to achieve the desired doped-carbon products. In the work, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 mmol borax in B were used for preparation of B/NC1,B/NC2, and B/NC3, respectively. For comparison, the N-doped carbon (NC) was also prepared by using the same method, except for the absence of borax in B."
4,Characterization methods,"2.3 Characterization methods The morphologies of the products were performed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-7500F) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI TalosF200x) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). The phase purity and crystallinity of the products were identified by a high-power X-ray diffractometer (XRD-6000, Shimadzu) with Cu Kα radiation source. The chemical structures were determined by a Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (BRUKER-TENSOR-27) using a standard KBr disk-compression method. The surface Raman spectrum was recorded on a Raman spectrometer (LabRAM HR800) with an Ar-laser source (488 nm) at ambient conditions. XPS measurements were carried out on a spectrometer (Thermo ESCALAB 250XI) with an Al Kα radiator and XPS deconvolution was conducted with the XPSPeak41 software. The BET specific surface area was measured at 77 K with a Micromeritics system (ASAP 2050) and the pore volume distributions were analyzed using Barrett − Joyner − Halenda (BJH) model."
5,Electrochemical measurements,"2.4 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical measurements were carried out on a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, Inc.). A three-electrode system was employed, including a rotation disk electrode (RDE) with a glassy carbon disk (disk area: 0.19635 cm2), and a rotation ring disk electrode (RRDE) with a glassy carbon disk (disk area: 0.24718 cm2) and a Pt ring (ring area: 0.18586 cm2) as the working electrode, a mercury/mercury oxide (Hg/HgO) electrode saturated with 1 mol L-1 KOH as the reference electrode, and a platinum wire as the auxiliary electrode. The catalyst ink (2 mg mL−1) was prepared by ultrasonically dispersing the as-prepared sample in ethanol to form a homogeneous mixture. 15 μL and 19 μL of the catalyst inks were pipetted and dropped onto the surface of the glass carbon disk of rotating disk electrode (RDE) and rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) with a micropipettor, respectively, followed by 7.5 μL of Nafion solution in ethanol (0.05 wt%), and dried at room temperature. The catalyst loading was about 0.15 mg cm−3 on RDE and RRDE, respectively. For the RDE test, the catalytic activity of samples was assessed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in N2-saturated and O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, respectively. In this experiment, all potentials were converted into that of reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the following equations: (1) E RHE = E Hg / H g O + 0.114 + 0.0591 p H Subsequently, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was measured from 1.0 to − 0.2 V (vs. RHE) in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 at rotation speeds of 400, 600, 900, 1200, 1600 and 2000 rpm, respectively. The electron transfer number (n) is crucial for evaluating the route of the ORR, which can be calculated from the slopes of the K-L plots using following equations: (2) 1 / j = 1 / j K + 1 / j L = 1 / j K + 1 / B ω 0.5 (3) B = 0.62 n F A C O 2 D O 2 2 / 3 v - 1 / 6 where j is the measured current, j K is the kinetic current density, j L is the diffusion-limiting current density, ω is the electrode rotation rate in rpm, n is the electron transfer number per oxygen molecule, F is the Faraday constant (96,485C mol−1), A is the area of glassy carbon disk of the work electrode, C O 2 is the concentration of O2 (1.26 × 106 mol cm−3) in 0.1 M KOH, D o 2 is the diffusion coefficient of O2 (1.90 × 105 cm2 s−1) in 0.1 M KOH, and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the 0.1 M KOH (0.01 cm2 s−1), respectively. In the RRDE test, the H2O2 production activity was evaluated by LSV in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH. The disk electrode was scanned from 1.0 to − 0.2 V (vs. RHE) at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 with the rotation speed of 1600 rpm, and the potential of Pt ring was held at 1.2 V (vs. RHE) to detect the H2O2 produced on disk electrode. The H2O2 selectivity and the electron transfer number (n) were calculated using the following relation: (4) H 2 O 2 % = 200 I r / ( N I d + I r ) (5) n = 4 I d / ( I d + I r / N ) where I d is the disk current density, I r is the ring current density, and N is the ring collection efficiency (0.37), respectively."
6,Computational details,"2.5 Computational details The spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [31-34]. The projector augmented wave (PAW) method was used to describe the core electrons of the atoms [35]. The GGA-revPBE functional was employed to describe the core electrons and their interaction with the valence ones [36,37]. A kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV was set for the electron plane wave basis. The convergence criteria of force was set to be 0.05 eV/Å in all the geometry optimizations. The Brillouin zone was sampled with a 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid [38]. The van der Waals interactions were corrected by semiempirical dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D2) [39]. A vacuum layer of 15 Å was used to prevent the interaction of z-direction. (6) Δ E HOO ∗ = E HOO ∗ / s u b - - E HOO ∗ - - E sub where EHOO*/sub , EHOO and Esub are the total energies of the substrate with HOO*, the free HOO* and the pure substrate, respectively. The free energy change (ΔG) of each reaction pathway was calculated based on the computational hydrogen electrode model (CHE) proposed by Nørskov et al. [40], which can be defined as following equation: (7) Δ G = Δ E + Δ Z P E - T Δ S + Δ G U + Δ G pH where ΔE is the reaction energy obtained from DFT computations. ΔZPE and ΔS are the changes of zero point energies and entropy, respectively, and T is temperature (298.15 K). The entropies and vibrational frequencies of the gas molecules were obtained from the NIST database, while the zero point energy and the entropies of adsorbed species were computed from the vibrational frequencies. ΔGU = –neU, in which n is the number of transferred electrons and U represents the electrode potential. ΔGpH = kBT × pH × ln10, where kB is Boltzmann constant and pH = 0. The limiting potential (UL ) for O2 reduction to H2O2 was defined by UL = -ΔGmax/e, in which ΔGmax is the maximum ΔG of elementary reaction."

8,Preparation and characterization of B/NC aerogels,"3.1 Preparation and characterization of B/NC aerogels The B, N co-doped carbon aerogels were fabricated by a facile crosslinking of the PVA-graphene (PVA-G) dispersion with borax, and then in-situ chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline using ammonium persulfate as oxidant, followed by pyrolysis, as shown in Scheme 1 . PVA-graphene (PVA-G) dispersion was prepared according to our previous method [30]. After chemical crosslinking with borax, the stable PVA-G-B/PANI aerogels can be obtained through a strong π − π* bonding interaction between graphene nanosheets and polyaniline [41]. To tune electrocatalytic activity, the hydrogels were prepared by tuning the mole ratio of borax and aniline ranging from 0.5, 1 to 2 during crosslinking and polymerization process, which were denoted as PVA-G-B/PANI-1, PVA-G-B/PANI-2, and PVA-G-B/PANI-3, respectively. Accordingly, the relative carbonized aerogels of PVA-G-B/PANI-X were denoted as B/NC1, B/NC2, and B/NC3, respectively. For comparison, PVA-G/PANI and NC aerogels were also synthesized by using a similar procedure except without borax. The morphologies of PVA-G-B/PANI-X and B/NCX aerogels were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Figure S1a, PVA-G/PANI showed a large number of stacked nanosheets, due to the absence of borax as the cross-linking agent. Accordingly, NC aerogel (Fig. 1 a) showed the similar closely-packed sheets. As shown in Figure S1b-d, PVA-G-B/PANI-X aerogels featured an interconnected three-dimensional (3D) network with aporousarchitecture, in which the average porous diameter increased from around 215 to 572 nm with increasing amounts of borax. For example, PVA-G-B/PANI-2 displayed a hierarchically porous architecture with the average diameter about 376 nm (Figure S1c). After the pyrolysis, B/NCX aerogels also displayed obvious porous structures, the average diameter of aerogels were measured to be about 194 nm for B/NC1, 383 nm for B/NC2 and 451 nm B/NC3 from SEM images (Fig. 1b-d), which were less than that of PVA- G-B/PANI-X precursors due to the shrinkage of the carbon skeletons during high temperature pyrolysis [42]. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to further investigate the structure of B/NCX. High high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1e) and the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of B/NC2 (Fig. 1f) displayed the multiple ultrathin graphene layers with a low degree of crystallinity. The element mapping (Fig. 1g) of B/NC2 showed a homogeneous distribution of C, N and B elements, indicating that both N and B atoms were incorporated uniformly into all carbon framework. NC, B/NC1 and B/NC2 had similar structures, as measured by TEM (Figure S3). Moreover, the N2 adsorption–desorption analysis was employed to characterize the physicochemical properties of the as-prepared samples. The significant N2 uptake at a relative pressure (P/P0) below 0.01 was ascribed to N2 adsorption in the microspores, while continuous N2 uptake at P/P0 between 0.05 and 0.3 was a typical characteristic of mesopores [43]. The N2 uptake with a relatively flat region followed by a rapid increase at P/P0 of 0.9 indicated the existence of large mesopores and macropores [43]. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas were measured to be 17.460 m2 g−1 for NC, 32.531 m2 g−1 for B/NC1, 67.627 m2 g−1 for B/NC2 and 44.899 m2 g−1 for B/NC3, ascribed to the hierarchically porous architecture of B/NCX. Apparently, the pore size distributions of B/NCX were shown in Figure S2d. As a result, the pore sizes of B/NCX were mainly distributed around 4.8 nm, indicating that lots of mesopores existed in all B/NCX. The abundant meso-/macropores structures of B/NCX aerogels are beneficial to enhance catalytic activity by accelerating ions and mass transport and exposing abundant active sites during electrocatalytic reaction [44,45]. Raman spectroscopy was employed to characterize the molecular structures of as-prepared carbon materials. As exhibited in Fig. 1i, NC and B/NCX aerogels showed two peaks around 1327 and 1570 cm−1, corresponding to the disordered carbon (D band) and crystalline graphitic carbon (G band), respectively [46]. The intensity ratio of D band to G band (ID/IG) is usually applied to assess the defect degree of carbon materials, and a higher ID/IG value indicates more defects in the carbon structure [47]. Compared with NC, the ID/IG intensity ratios were measured to be 0.97 for B/NC1, 1.18 for B/NC2, and 1.17 for B/NC3, in which B/NC2 owned the highest ID/IG value among the three B/NCX materials, suggesting that abundant structure defects provide more catalytic active sites for ORR [48-50]. The chemical composition and elemental states of the as-prepared catalysts were further investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 2 a gives the XPS survey spectra of NC and B/NCX aerogels. B/NCX are mainly composed of C, N, O and B elements, while NC consisted of C, N and O elements, indicating that B and N atoms have been successfully introduced into carbon frameworks of B/NCX catalysts. As given in Table 1 , as the amount of borax increases from 0.4 to 0.8 and 1.6 mmol during the preparation process, the B doping level increases from 8.25 at% for B/NC1 to 13.71 at% for B/NC2 and 15.56 at% for B/NC3, while the relative content of total N doping firstly increases from 5.49 at% for B/NC1 to 12.32 at% for B/NC2, and then decreases to 11.50 at% for B/NC3. The obvious reports indicate that the incorporation of B atoms may induce a change in N configurations of B/NCX [51]. Therefore, the high resolution C1s, B1s and N 1 s XPS spectra of B/NCX were investigated to analyze the composition of as-prepared catalysts by theoretical bonding energy and full width at half maximum (FWHM) (Table S1). The high resolution C1s XPS spectra of B/NCX (Figure S4) could be deconvoluted into six peaks at about 284, 284.2, 285.1, 286.2, 288.3 and 290.7 eV, which can be assignedto C-B, CC, CN, CO, CO, and π-π* (CC) group, respectively [52-54], indicating that B and N atoms have been efficiently co-doped in the carbon matrix. As shown as Fig. 2b-d, the peaks at 190.1, 191.0 and 192.4 eV are attributed to the B-N, BC2O and BCO2 groups, respectively [55,56], strongly suggesting the presence of B and N atoms in B/NCX. It was found that as the B contents of B/NCX increase, the B contents in B-N bond firstly increase and then decrease, whereas the B contents in BC2O and BCO2 groups gradually increased (Table 1). Among them, B/NC2 has the highest B content (5.60 at%) in B-N bond. Fig. 2e-i gives the high resolution N1s XPS spectra of NC and B/NCX. The N 1 s spectra of B/NCX are deconvoluted into four peaks at 397.9, 398.7, 400.3 and 401.5 eV, ascribed to N-B, pyridinic-N (N6), pyrrolic-N (N5), and quaternary-N (NQ) species, respectively [56]. It can be seen that B/NC2 possesses the highest N contents in N-B (5.33 at%) and N6 (5.28 at%) species, compared to B/NC1 and B/NC3. Note that the B contents of B-N in B 1 s spectra is approximate to the N content of N-B in N1s XPS spectra of B/NCX (Table 1). The previous studies have demonstrated that hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) tends to be formed as the atom ratio of B to N is 1:1,because it is the most thermodynamically stable form in B, N co-doped carbon [56-59]. Thus, we speculated that hBN species are formed in the B/NCX samples. Moreover, the structures of the B/NCX were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). We found that the XRD pattern (Fig. 2i) of NC catalyst reveals only broad diffraction peak at around 23°, mainly ascribed to amorphous structure [60], while another two characteristic peaks at around 26° and 43° were found in B/NC1, B/NC2, and B/NC3, which were attributed to the (002) and (100) planes of hBN, respectively [61,62]. Moreover, the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of B/NCX and NC catalysts were displayed in Figure S5. Two obvious peaks located at 1389 and 779 cm−1 could be observed, which were attributed to in-plane ring B-N stretching vibration and the out-of-plane B-N-B bending vibration, respectively, which were similar with the reported results of hBN [63,64], whereas no obvious peaks appeared for NC sample. These results confirmed the existence of hBN species in B/NC1, B/NC2, and B/NC3, which has proved a higher activity and selectivity toward the 2e- ORR to H2O2 [56]. Accordingly, we expect that the co-existence of hBN and N6 in the three B/NCX catalysts can facilitate 2e- ORR."
9,Oxygen reduction activity of B/NC aerogels,"3.2 Oxygen reduction activity of B/NC aerogels The electrochemical performance of NC and B/NC aerogels for ORR was evaluated using a three-electrode system in oxygen-saturated 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution at room temperature. The working electrodes were a rotating disk electrode (RDE) and a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE), respectively. As shown in Fig. 3 a, cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of as-prepared carbon materials displayed no peak in N2-saturated KOH electrolyte, whereas an obvious oxygen reduction peak appeared in O2-saturated KOH electrolyte, demonstrating their catalytic activity for ORR. For B/NC2, the oxygen reduction peak was obtained at 0.74 V (vs. RHE), more positive than that of NC (0.65 V vs. RHE), B/NC1 (0.71 V vs. RHE) and B/NC3 (0.73 V vs. RHE), suggesting a good electrochemical reduction activity for ORR. The 2e- ORR pathway toward H2O2 is dominant in this study according to their liner sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves carried out by a RRDE. The oxygen reduction current densities were measured on the disk electrode (solid lines), while H2O2 oxidation current densities were measured on the ring electrode (dashed lines) under rotating rates of 1600 rpm, as indicated in Fig. 3b. B/NC2 exhibited a high 2e- ORR reactivity with an onset potential of 0.82 V vs. RHE), which was more positive than that of NC (0.77 V vs. RHE) and B/NC1 (0.78 V vs. RHE) and close to that of B/NC3. The ring electrode was stated at 1.2 V vs. RHE to only produce H2O2 at the ring for ORR product quantification [65]. It can be seen that the increase of the ring current densities follows the order of NC, B/NC1, B/NC3 and B/NC2 at the range from 0.3 V vs. RHE to 0.7 V vs. RHE, indicating that the doping of B atoms enhances the production ratio of H2O2 and B/NC2 may produce more H2O2. Fig. 3c exhibits the H2O2 selectivity of NC and B/NCX as a function of potential based on the results of Fig. 3b. We found that B/NC1, B/NC2 and B/NC3 have a high selectivity around 80% toward H2O2 with a potential range from 0.40 to 0.70 V vs. RHE. Specifically, B/NC2 presents the H2O2 selectivity of 94.16% at 0.6 V vs. RHE, superior than that of NC (71.23%), B/NC1 (88.67%) and B/NC2 (91.12%). From Fig. 3d, the electron transfer numbers (n) of B/NC1, B/NC2 and B/NC3 were calculated to be around 2 during the ORR process, while that of NC is larger than 2.5 at the potential range from 0.3 V vs. RHE to 0.7 V vs. RHE, which is consistent with the electron transfer number (n) calculated from the slopes of Koutecky–Levich (K − L) plots by RDE (Figure S6d-f). These results suggest that B/NC1, B/NC2 and B/NC3 would favor a 2e- ORR process toward H2O2, which may be ascribed to co-doping of B and N into the carbon matrix. Note that NC has the lowest selectivity for H2O2. Therefore, we deduce that that hBN species play an important role in improving 2e- ORR activity. The long-term stability performance is critical for the commercial applications of ORR catalysts. Fig. 3e is the current–time (i-t) curve of B/NC2. It can be found that there was no obvious attenuation in both the disk and ring current densities in a constant potential at 0.6 V vs. RHE for 50000 s. Notably, B/NC2 affords a low onset potential of 0.82 V vs. RHE. and high H2O2 selectivity of 94.16% at the potential of 0.6 V, superior than most of the other reported electrocatalysts, as shown in Fig. 3f and Table S2. To investigate the intrinsic reason for the improved catalytic performance of B/NC aerogels toward ORR, the numbers of active sites are estimated as an important factor by calculating the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the relevant reaction kinetics, responded by the double layer capacitance (Cdl) that is positively correlated with ECSA (Figure S7) [66,67]. As shown in Figure S7e, the Cdl of NC was more higher than that of B/NCX, demonstrating that the co-doping of B and N into the carbon matrix did increase the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. In addition, the Cdl of B/NC2 (6.91 mF cm−2) was higher than that of of B/NC1 (5.62 mF cm−2) and B/NC3 (6.51 mF cm−2). We therefore deduce that B/NC2 possess the excellent 2e- ORR performance with the highest selectivity for H2O2 generation among B/NCX, which might be attributed to the higher contents of hBN and N6 than that of B/NC1 and B/NC3. Therefore, it is deduced that that a synergistic coupling effect between hBN and N6 leads to an efficient 2e- ORR toward H2O2. To verify our speculation, we intentionally used phosphate anions to block the N6 active sites, while at the same time not influencing the structures of B/NC2 [68]. As shown in Figure 4a, H2O2 selectivity of B/NC2 exhibited an evident drop at the potential range from 0.3 V vs. RHE to 0.7 V vs. RHE after injecting 0.3 M H3PO4. In addition, XPS spectra (Fig. 4 b) reveal that the content of N6 in B/NC2 decreases obviously after being soaked in 0.3 M H3PO4. The change of 2e- ORR activity is in consistent with N6 content, indicating that the ORR activity should be profoundly affected by the N6 sites. Accordingly, N6 species of the catalysts play key roles for the ORR toward H2O2."
10,Catalytic mechanism of the 2e- ORR on B/NC catalysts,"3.3 Catalytic mechanism of the 2e- ORR on B/NC catalysts The identification of active sites for this catalytic process is important for the rational design of catalysts. Therefore, we employed density functional theory (DFT) simulation to investigate the catalytic mechanism of O2 reduction toward H2O2. The reaction pathway of formation of H2O2 has been described in the following equations: * + O2 + H2O + e- = HOO* + OH– (8) HOO* + e-= HO2 – + * (9) where HOO* is a crucial intermediate in the overall process, which directly affects the (8) and (9) reaction [65]. Thus, the HOO* binding energy (△GHOO*) is considered as a key descriptor in controlling the catalyst activity for 2e- ORR [69,70]. Based on the results mentioned-above that hBN, defects and N6 acted as active sites for H2O2 produces, three groups of computational configurations were built firstly, including hBN group, hBN with defects (hBN-D) group, and hBN with neighboring N6 (hBN-N6) group (Figure S8a). The possible the active sites of hBN, hBN-D and hBN-N6 groups for HOO* adsorption were simulated (Figure S8b), in which the stable absorption sites of HOO* are B1of hBN group, B1, B2, B3 and N1 of hBN-D group, and B1, B2, B3, B4, B6, N1, N5 and N8 of hBN-N6 group (Figure S8a). For the ideal catalyst, it is accepted that the adsorption of HOO* should be thermoneutral at the equilibrium potential, (U0(O2/H2O2) = 0.7 V) so that the theoretical overpotential value for the reaction is zero,70, 71 and its free-energy diagram is flat at the equilibrium potential in Fig. 5 b. Either stronger and weaker binding to HOO* will bring additional thermodynamic overpotential or lower electrocatalytic activity [71]. Form the calculated oxygen reduction volcano plot for 2e- ORR toward H2O2 in Fig. 5a, the overpotentials of hBN-B1, hBN-D-B1 and hBN-N6-B1 sites were calculated to be 0.08, 0.19 and 0.06 V, respectively, which are lower than that of the other absorption sites of HOO* in their respective groups, suggesting their higher activity, because they lie closest to the peak of the volcano. Among them, hBN-N6-B1 site has the lowest overpotential or highest activity for 2e- ORR. In addition, the free energy diagram (Fig. 5b) also indicates that hBN-N6-B1 possess the smallest free energy barriers for reducing O2 to H2O2 among all active sites. Accordingly, hBN-N6-B1 is considered as the most active site for the reduction O2 to H2O2. Apparently, the coupling interaction between hBN and N6 is crucial for synergistically boosting the 2e- ORR performances. To provide an in-depth theoretical understanding role of hBN and N6 sites, the electronic structures of the active sites are investigated. Fig. 5c presents the partial density of state (PDOS) of hBN-B1, hBN-D-B1and hBN-N6-B1 sites. It can be found that the center of B 2p orbitals (Ep) of hBN-N6-B1 is closer to the Fermi level (Ef) than those of hBN-B1 and hBN-D-B1, suggesting that hBN-N6-B1 site has the stronger binding abilities to HOO* intermediates than those of hBN-B1, hBN-D-B1 sites. Moreover, the charge density difference analysis (Fig. 5d) of hBN-B1, hBN-D-B1, and hBN-N6-B1 displays an obvious electron accumulation in the C and N atoms and depletion electron on B atoms, which ascribed to the lower electronegativity of B (2.0) than that of C (2.5) and N (3.0) [72], which makes B atoms create the empty orbitals to accept the electrons from HOO* intermediates. To further explore the interactions between HOO* and hBN-N6-B1 sites, the crystal orbitals Hamilton population (COHP) was employed to analyze the contributions (%) of B 2 s and 2p electrons and O 2 s, O 2p electrons of HOO* intermediates. Here, HOO* intermediates were adsorbed on B acitve sites of hBN-B1, hBN-D-B1 and hBN-N6-B1 species. The eletron component (%) of the bonding states in Table S4 shows that B 2p and O 2 s eletrons creates a strong interaction for the adsoprtion of HOO* intermediates on the B sites of hBN-B1, hBN-D-B1 and hBN-N6-B1, respectively, which isascribed to the hybridization of B 2p and O 2 s orbitals of HOO* intermediates. The B-O bond strength was further evaluated by theintegratedCOHP(ICOHP, Fig. 5e-g and Table S5). The ICOHP of hBN-N6-B1 (-1.07) is more nagative than that of hBN-D-B1 (-0.97) and hBN-B1 (-0.94), indicating that the hBN-N6-B1 sites has more stronger interaction with the HOO* intermediate, thus lowering free energy barrier for HOO* formation and enhancing 2e- ORR activity. Base on DFT calculation, we reasonably draw a conclusion that hBN coupled with neighbouring pyridinic-N sites is considered as the optimal active sites for reduction of O2 to H2O2 by 2e- ORR."
11,Conclusions,"In this work, we have developed B/NC catalysts by means of a facile gelation and subsequent pyrolysis in the presence of low-cost PVA-graphene, aniline, borax and graphene as precursors. By tailoring the ratio of initial precursors, the catalytic activity of B/NC for 2e- ORR to H2O2 can be tuned. Among them, B/NC2 exhibited the highest catalytic activity for 2e- ORR with the onset potential of 0.82 V vs. RHE, H2O2 selectivity of 94.16% at the potential of 0.6 V vs. RHE, and excellent long-term stability with 50000 s in alkaline media, ascribed to abundant porous, larger specific surface area, and higher contents of hBN and pyridinic-N. DFT calculations disclosed that the hBN coupled with neighbouring pyridinic-N were acted as active sites that synergistically lower the free energy barrier for HOO* formation, benefiting production of H2O2 via 2e- ORR path. Moreover, the B 2p electrons play an essential role in the adsorption of HOO* intermediates, owing to its strong interaction with the O 2 s electrons. This work provides an avenue for design electrochemical catalysts for 2e- ORR toward H2O2 with high performance."
