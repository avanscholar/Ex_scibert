0,Introduction,"In order to prevent environment pollution caused by petroleum-based plastics and reduce the exploitation of petroleum resources, biopolymer materials have attracted more and more attention due to their excellent properties, such as biodegradability, safety, biocompatibility, and renewability [1–3]. In recent years, biological materials such as polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids have been highly focused [4]. Among which, chitosan is widely used in food packaging because of excellent film-forming property, non-toxicity and biodegradability [3,5]. However, the mechanical resistance of pure chitosan film is rather low. Therefore, chitosan compensated by other polymers like PVA, a synthetic polymer with great biodegradability, flexibility, oxygen barrier properties and without toxicity, is a good choice to improve its mechanical property [6,7]. Previous studies have reported that CS/PVA blended films would own better related properties when the optimum weight ratio of CS to PVA was 7:3 [8]. Moreover, films based on biodegradable materials were often incorporated with other bioactive compounds, such as plant extracts or inorganic metal particles, to satisfy the changing preferences and expectations of modern consumers [3,9]. Nowadays, inorganic metal nanoparticles including Nano-ZnO, Nano-TiO2, Nano-sliver, Nano-gold, etc., have been added in packaging films [5,10,11]. Among these inorganic metal nanoparticles, Nano-ZnO have received more attention owing to its non-toxicity and better antimicrobial activity [5,12]. Therefore, Nano-ZnO was added in CS/PVA blended films to be acted as reinforcing antimicrobial agent [5]. In addition, bio-composite films can be incorporated with anthocyanins, which are regarded as antioxidant and colorimetric pH indicator [1,13]. Many studies have reported that intelligent films incorporated with anthocyanins could monitor food spoilage, which could effectively transfer food information to consumers in real time [14–16]. Till now, anthocyanins, extracted from vegetables, fruits, and flowers, have been widely used in active and intelligent films, e.g. purple potato [17], red cabbage [8], black carrot [18], roselle [19] etc.. And it is proven that the functional and physical properties of the composite films would be greatly affected by different compositions and contents of anthocyanins [9,20,21]. Zhang, Huang, Yan, Hu and Ren [20] has reported that corn starch and PVA film with purple sweet potato extracts exhibited more distinct color, better light barrier property and mechanical properties than corn starch and PVA film with red cabbage extracts at lower incorporation level. Previous have found that the anthocyanin compositions of purple potato and roselle are different: Cyanidin and peonidin were observed in purple potato according to HPLC-MS/MS data [22], whereas cyanidin, delphinidin and pelargonidin were found in roselle calyx by UPLC-QTOF MSE [23]. As far as we known, few researches reported about comparing the effects of anthocyanins extracted from purple potato and roselle on the physical and functional properties of chitosan/PVA/nano-ZnO films. Therefore, in this work, active and intelligent films were investigated based on CS/PVA/nano-ZnO incorporated with anthocyanins extracted from purple potato or roselle. The effects of anthocyanins content and composition on the physical and functional properties for packaging films were also investigated and compared, including micromorphology structure and mechanical, barrier, pH-sensitive, antibacterial properties. The films were also applied in the freshness of shrimp for their function examination."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials and chemical reagents,"2.1 Materials and chemical reagents Purple potato powder, roselle and fresh white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) were purchased from local market (Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China). Nano-ZnO (MW:81.39, particle size: 50 ± 10 nm, specific surface area value: 20– 40 m2/g) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China). Chitosan ((C6H11NO4)n, average molecular weight: 260,000 Da [24], degree of deacetylation: 80–95%, viscosity: 50– 800 mPa·s, CAS number 9012-76-4), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, MW:1750 ± 50, viscosity: 54.0– 66.0 mm2/s, degree of alcoholysis: 98.0– 99.8%, CAS number 9002-89-5) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) and Escherichia coli O157:H7 (ATCC 35150) were provided by food microbiology laboratory in College of Biosystems Engineering and Food Science, Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, China). All chemicals were analytical grade."
3,Extraction and UV–vis spectroscopy measurement of anthocyanins,"2.2 Extraction and UV–vis spectroscopy measurement of anthocyanins Anthocyanins were extracted from roselle calyx and purple potato powder according to the method of Huang, Chen, Zhou, Li and Hu [19]. Firstly, the dried roselle calyx was grounded into powders. Then, roselle calyx powders and purple potato powders were respectively dissolved in 50% ethanol solution (the ratio of solid to liquid is 1:10) at 30 ± 2 °C for 4 h. After filtration, the alcohol solutions of anthocyanins were concentrated at 40 ± 2 °C then vacuum freeze-dried at −50 ± 1 °C for 2 days by a freeze dryer (Labconco, Beijing Light Ace HK Limited, China) to afford purple potato extract (PPE) and roselle extract (RE) powders. The total anthocyanin contents of PPE and RE were 8.2 mg/g and 12.3 mg/g by pH–differential method [25], respectively. According to the method reported by Liu, Zhang, Li, Qin, Xiao and Liu [25] with some modification, the pH-sensitivity of extracts was evaluated. Briefly, 50 mg of PPE or RE were dissolved for 10 min in 15 mL buffer prepared using 0.1 M NaOH and HCl and 0.2 M NaHPO4 and NaH2PO4 with the pH of 2–13. The color changes were photographed and the UV–vis spectra of extract solutions were recorded on the UV-2600 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) by scanning from 450 to 700 nm."
4,Preparation of films,"2.3 Preparation of films CS-PPE and CS-RE films were developed according to the method described by Pereira, de Arruda and Stefani [8] with some modification. Chitosan (3.5 g) and Nano-ZnO (0.5 g) were dissolved together in 350 mL of aqueous acetic acid 1% (v/v) under magnetic stirring at room temperature for 3 h. PVA (1.5 g) was dissolved in 150 mL of distilled water under magnetic stirring at 90 ± 2 °C for 30 min and cooled down to room temperature. Then, CS/PVA/Nano-ZnO mixture was obtained by mixing and magnetic stirring the above obtained two solutions (the ratio of CS/Nano-ZnO hydrogel to PVA hydrogel is 7:3), namely as CPZ. The solution, without Nano-ZnO, is later referred as CP. Subsequently, different amounts of PPE and RE (0, 120, 180 and 240 mg/g, based on the dry weight of CS and PVA) were individually added into CPZ solution, and later referred as CPZ-PPE I, CPZ-PPE II, CPZ-PPE III, CPZ-RE I, CPZ-RE II, CPZ-RE III, respectively. Here, 0.2% (v/v) glycerol was added and the mixed solutions were continued to magnetic stirring for 30 min. Finally, 25 mL of the solution was decanted into plastic petri dishes (d = 90 mm) and dried at an oven at 45 °C for 12 h. All films were stored in a refrigerator (4 °C) for further use."
5,Structural characterization of films,"2.4 Structural characterization of films FT-IR spectra of films were investigated via a spectrometer (AVA TAR370, NICOLET Co., Ltd., America) from 4000 to 400 cm−1 at 4 cm−1. XRD patterns of films were evaluated by X-ray diffraction (Bruker AXS D8 Advance, Germany) according to the method reported by Ge, Li, Bai, Yuan, Wu and Hu [13].The surface and cross section morphologies of the films were observed via a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (SU-8010, HITACHI Co., Ltd., Japan)."
6,Physical properties of films,"2.5 Physical properties of films 2.5.1 Physical appearance, thickness and mechanical properties The digital images of films were photographed by covering film on the bamboo leaves. Five random points of a film were measured and calculated the average value to obtain film thickness via a Mitutoyo digital micrometer (accuracy of 0.001 mm) (CHY-C2A, Labthink Technology Co., Ltd., China). The tensile strength (TS, MPa) and elongation at break (EB, %) of films were measured by an auto tensile tester (XLW-M, Labthink Technology Co., Ltd., China) according to the methods of Huang, Chen, Zhou, Li and Hu [19]. For each film four replicates were tested. 2.5.2 Moisture content and water vapor permeability Moisture content was determined by a Halogen rapid moisture tester (DHS-20A, Shanghai Eastsen Analytical Instruments Co., Ltd., China) and each sample was measured with three films to calculate the average value.Water vapor barrier property of film was investigated according to the method of Yong, Liu, Qin, Bai, Zhang and Liu [26] with some modification. Briefly, film was closely covered on 50 mL of centrifuge tube containing anhydrous silica gels (40 g), and tightened with rubber bands without gaps. Then, the centrifuge tubes with tested films were kept at 25 °C in a desiccator with 75% relative humidity. The centrifuge tubes were individually weighed every 24 h for 6 days. Water vapor permeability (WVP) was calculated as follows: WVP = W × x t × A × ∆ P where W was the weight gain of the centrifuge tube (g), x was film thickness (mm), t was time (d), A was the permeation area of film (m2), and ΔP (kPa) was partial vapor pressure at 25 °C. 2.5.3 Light transmittance and opacity Light barrier property of films was measured via a UV-2700 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) within the range of 200–800 nm. Opacity of the film was calculated according to the method of Sun, Jiang, Wu, Tong, Pang and Wu [5]."
7,Functional properties of films,"2.6 Functional properties of films 2.6.1 pH-sensitive property Films (d = 10 mm) were submerged in buffer solutions (pH 2–12) for 10 min. Different color changes of films were photographed, and color parameters of films were measured by a colorimeter (CM-3500d, Konica Minolta Co., Ltd., Japan). According to the following equation, the ΔE was calculated [13]. ∆ E = L ∗ − L 0 2 + a ∗ − a 0 2 + b ∗ − b 0 2 where L⁎, a⁎ and b⁎ were the color parameters of films, which soaked into buffer solutions. L0, a0 and b0 were the color parameters of original films. 2.6.2 Antibacterial activity Antibacterial capacity of all films were tested according to the method reported by Abral, Ariksa, Mahardika, Handayani, Aminah, Sandrawati, Pratama, Fajri, Sapuan and Ilyas [27] with some modification. Briefly, 100 μL of S. aureus or E. coli suspension was distributed evenly over Luria-Bertani agar. Then, 10 mm disks of films, sterilized under UV light for 15 min [28], were orderly placed on the test microbe suspension with a tweezer. All mediums were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, then recorded the inhibition zone diameters (mm). Three parallel experiments were set."
8,Application of film on shrimp,"2.7 Application of film on shrimp Film, with best properties, was chose to monitor the freshness of shrimp. Fresh shrimp was put into the petri dish (d = 90 mm) with a film (1 × 2 cm), which was attached on the inner top lid with tape. Then, the petri dish was sealed with tape as well and placed for 8 d under 4 °C. The total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) contents and pH values were determined every 2 days with three replicates. Minced shrimp meat (5 g) was homogenized at a speed of 10,000 rpm for 2 min with 45 mL distilled water, then centrifuged at a speed of 8000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min to obtain liquid supernatant for later experiments. The pH of the sample liquid supernatant was measured by a digital pH meter (PHS-550, Shanghai Bant Instrument Co., Ltd., China) at 25 ± 2 °C. The total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N) was measured according to the semi-micro-titration method reported by Sun, Guo, Ji, Wu, Zhu, Wang, Cheng, Chen and Zhang [29]. Briefly, 5 mL liquid supernatant was mixed with 5 mL MgO (10 g L−1). Then the mixture was distilled for 5 min with a Kjeldahl Apparatus (KDY-9820, Beijing, China). Meanwhile, the mixture of 5 mL MgO (10 g L−1) and 5 mL distilled water was considered as a blank test. 10 mL boric acid (20 g L−1) was added into 250 mL conical flask as an acid receiver with 3–4 drops of methyl red-methylene blue, a mixed indicator. Finally, 0.01 M hydrochloric acid solution was used to titrate the absorption solution. TVB-N value was calculated by the following equation: TVB − N mg / 100 g = V 1 − V 2 × c × 14 m × 5 50 × 100 where V1 and V2 are volume (mL) of HCl for sample and blank, respectively. C is the concentration of HCl (mol/L) and m is the weight of vannamei shrimp meat (g)."
9,Statistical analysis,"2.8 Statistical analysis The statistical data were analyzed using Origin 9.0 software (Origin Lab Corporation, USA) and SPSS software (SPSS 25.0 for windows, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All the statistical data were performed as the mean value ± standard deviation of film."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Color changes of PPE and RE in different buffer solutions,"3.1 Color changes of PPE and RE in different buffer solutions Anthocyanins presented different colors at different pH values, which was attributed to the structural changes of anthocyanins [21]. According to Fig. 1 , the color ranges of PPE were red>pink>purple>blue>kelly>yellow from acidic to alkaline buffer solutions. In contrast, the color of RE was much darker than that of PPE in the same buffer solution, presenting red>gray>puce>green with increasing in alkalinity. It was obvious that the color of purple potato anthocyanin was more diverse, whereas the color of roselle anthocyanin was deeper, which was due to the difference of anthocyanins content and composition. According to HPLC-MS/MS data, only cyanidin and peonidin were observed in purple potato [22]. However, cyanidin, delphinidin and pelargonidin were found in roselle calyx by UPLC-QTOF MSE [23]. The UV–vis spectroscopy explained the color change of anthocyanins solutions. With the pH values varied from 2 to 13, the maximum absorption peak of PPE and RE shifted from 530 nm to 620 nm. In addition, the maximum absorption intensities decreased with the acidity or alkalinity faded. The similar trend was also found in purple sweet potato and red cabbage extracts [20]."
12,Formation of intermolecular bonds in film,"3.2 Formation of intermolecular bonds in film The intermolecular interactions of each components in films were detected by FT-IR spectra (Fig. 2 ). CS showed bands at 3424–3248 cm−1, 1629 cm−1, 1384 cm−1, 1157 cm−1, 1081 cm−1, resulting from OH and OH stretching vibration, amide I, amide II, C–O–C and CO stretching, respectively [5,12,30]. The spectra of PVA at 3405 cm−1, 2942 cm−1, 1096 cm−1, 1456 cm−1 was related to OH stretching, CH asymmetric stretching, CO stretching, CH-CH2 bending in basic carbon skeleton, respectively [19,31]. In nano-ZnO spectra, bands at 3424 cm−1 and a broad peak in the range of 400–600 cm−1 was ascribed to OH stretching vibration and ZnO [5]. PPE presented bands at 3385 cm−1 (OH stretching), 2930 cm−1 (CH2 stretching), 1632 cm−1 (CC stretching of aromatic ring), 1335 cm−1 (CO stretching) and 1035 cm−1 (CH deformation of aromatic ring) [20]. RE exhibited bands at 3416 cm−1 (OH stretching), and 1743 cm−1, 1628 cm−1 and 1095 cm−1 for CO, CN and CO stretching, respectively. Moreover, a weak band at 1794 cm−1, for the pyran ring stretching of flavonoid compounds, did not show in spectra of RE but in CPZ-RE films [19]. Notably, the band at 3419 cm−1 (OH stretching) in CS/PVA film shifted to a lower wave number around 3385 cm−1 in CPZ-PPE and CPZ-RE films after adding Nano-ZnO and extracts, which was ascribed to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the components of films. Similar shift results of OH position were also reported in konjac glucomannan/chitosan films with Nano-ZnO and mulberry anthocyanin extract [5]."
13,Amorphous of film,"3.3 Amorphous of film The nature (crystal/amorphous) of the prepared material was analyzed by XRD. The XRD patterns of all films were shown in Fig. 3 . The CP film showed two peaks at 2θ = 19.7° and 2θ = 11.3°. The intensity of CP film at around 2θ = 19.7° decreased remarkably with the addition of nano-ZnO and purple potato or roselle extracts. There were two explanations for this phenomenon: one was that the formation of the new hydrogen bonds between anthocyanins and polymer matrix, which was confirmed in FT-IR spectra, resulting in the destruction of original interactions and promotion of spatial remodeling; the other was that the plasticization of PPE/RE and electrostatic interactions among all components [5]."
14,Microstructure of films,"3.4 Microstructure of films Microstructure of film surface and cross-section was shown in Fig. 4 . For surfaces (Fig. 4A), all films were smooth and homogeneous, implying the good compatibility among CS, PVA, Nano-ZnO, PPE/RE and glycerol [5]. For cross-section (Fig. 4B), CP film exhibited uniform, dense and smooth cross-section, while some aggregates were observed in CPZ film due to undissolved ZnO nanoparticles. Qin, Liu, Yuan, Yong and Liu [11] also found similar phenomenon in CS film incorporated with Nano-TiO2. However, the folds in CPZ film decreased when extracts were added, suggesting that extracts could fill the gap by forming the new hydrogen bonds with CS/PVA polymer matrix. Moreover, CPZ-PPE I and CPZ-RE I films showed a relatively smoother and denser cross-section, indicating low contents of extracts (120 mg/100 mL) could be well distributed in CPZ matrix. Similar results were also observed in chitosan film incorporated with purple and black eggplant extracts [21]."
15,"Physical appearances, thicknesses and mechanical properties of films","3.5 Physical appearances, thicknesses and mechanical properties of films As shown in Fig. 5 , CP and CPZ films were transparent, where CPZ-PPE and CPZ-RE films presented purple and blue color due to the coloration of anthocyanins [26]. In addition, films got darker with the increasing extract amounts (from 120 mg/100 mL to 240 mg/100 mL), and CPZ-RE films were rather darker than CPZ-PPE films at the same incorporation levels. This was possibly because that the majority of anthocyanins composition and content were different in PPE and RE [22,23]. Kurek, Garofulić, Bakić, Ščetar, Uzelac and Galić [32] also observed that the color intensity of chitosan films with blackberry extracts was stronger than chitosan films with blueberry extracts at same concentration. And there was no significant difference in thicknesses of all films (P > 0.05), approximately 0.06 mm in Table 1 , indicating that low content of extracts was well dispersed in film matrix. Tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (EB) were often used to reflect the mechanical resistance and flexibility of food packaging, respectively [33]. As shown in Table 1, CP film showed the lowest tensile strength (7.19 ± 1.25 MPa) and the highest elongation at break (69.50 ± 7.19%) as compared with other films (P < 0.05). CPZ film presented higher tensile strength (15.90 ± 2.86 MPa) and lower elongation at break (39.50 ± 5.51%) than CP film, which was due to that nano-ZnO could form a compact structure with chitosan/PVA and reduce the mobility of chitosan/PVA, respectively. In addition, with the incorporation of extracts, the values of tensile strength and elongation at break of films were subsequently increased and decreased (P < 0.05), respectively, indicating the addition of anthocyanin extracts could enhance the mechanical resistance and lower flexibility of chitosan/PVA film. On the one hand, the formation of hydrogen bonds between anthocyanins and film matrix could improve the mechanical resistance [11]. On the other hand, anthocyanins could impede chain-chain interactions between film components then reduce the flexibility of films [33]."
16,Moisture contents and WVP of films,"3.6 Moisture contents and WVP of films According to Table 1, the moisture content of CP film was the highest (P < 0.05) among all films, which was attributed to the hydrophilic nature of chitosan, PVA and glycerol [25]. Comparing with CP film, the moisture content of CPZ film decreased to 24.24 ± 1.02% (P < 0.05), which was supposed to be associated to the coordination effect formed between Zinc oxide nanoparticles and hydroxyl/amino groups in CS/PVA, preventing the absorbance of moisture [11]. Moreover, when incorporated with PPE and RE, the moisture content decreased (P > 0.05). The reason for this phenomenon was that CS/PVA combined with anthocyanins in PPE and RE by forming intermolecular hydrogen bonds replaced a part of interactions of CPZ-moisture. It was well known that the addition of anthocyanins extract could decrease the moisture content of films, especially purple and black rice extracts, red cabbage extracts [26,34]. WVP, an important indicator to evaluate the water barrier property of food packaging films, was investigated and showed in Table 1. The WVP of CS/PVA film was 6.46 g ± 0.10 mm/m2 day kPa, and this value was not significantly changed by the addition of Nano-ZnO and anthocyanin extracts (P > 0.05).The results of this study were consistent with that of Silva-Pereira, Teixeira, Pereira-Júnior and Stefani [35], who found that the water vapor barrier of chitosan/starch film was not significantly changed by the incorporation of red cabbage extract. The above results indicated that, as compared with petroleum-based polymers, the WVP of biodegradable films need further improvements. Romani, Olsen, Pinto Collares, Meireles Oliveira, Prentice and Martins [36] prepared a bi-layer film, based on fish protein and added a carnauba wax coating (a hydrophobic component), which was treated by glow discharge plasma to increase the adhesion property of film, remarkably reducing the WVP from 9.6 ± 0.30 g mm/day m2 kPa to 3.33 ± 0.23 g mm/day m2 kPa."
17,Light transmittance of films,"3.7 Light transmittance of films The UV–vis light barrier property is an essential indicator for food packaging films to prevent food oxidation caused by UV–vis light [28,32,33]. As demonstrated in Fig. 6 , compared with CP and CPZ films, the remarkable decrease of light transmission in films incorporated with anthocyanins extract was due to that UV–vis irradiation was partly absorbed by anthocyanins [21]. Moreover, the light transmittance of CPZ-PPE and CPZ-RE films decreased further with the increase of anthocyanins extract. It was also observed that CPZ-RE films showed lower light transmittance than CPZ-PPE films, which was attributed to the higher anthocyanins content in RE (12.3 mg/g) than PPE (8.2 mg/g) in the same incorporation levels. Similar results were also found in chitosan films with blueberry and blackberry anthocyanins and chitosan films with purple and black eggplant extractions, which also achieved better UV–vis light barrier property than transparent films [21,32]. As shown in Table 1, with the addition of anthocyanins extract, the values of opacity significantly increased (P < 0.05) than CP and CPZ films, and CPZ-RE III films showed the highest opacity value, indicating abundant anthocyanins could decrease the transparency of films [5]."
18,Antimicrobial activity of films,"3.8 Antimicrobial activity of films The antibacterial activities of film samples were evaluated by the size of inhibitory zone against S. aureus (Gram-positive) and E. coli (Gram-negative). As shown in Table 2 and Fig. 7 , it was observed that CP film did not show any antimicrobial activity, while CPZ film had visible inhibition zone with the addition of ZnO nanoparticles. Two mechanisms responsible for antimicrobial activities of ZnO nanoparticles has been proposed: one was that Zn2+, released from film matrix, could effectively inhibit the bacterial growth [5]; the other was that the surface of ZnO nanoparticles could produce hydrogen peroxide [37]. Furthermore, the inhibition zone diameters of S. aureus and E. coli were 15.09 ± 0.32 mm and 11.72 ± 1.47 mm, respectively, indicating that CPZ film had higher antimicrobial activity against gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. Previous studies also reported similar results, suggesting the Nano-ZnO was more effective against S. aureus than E. coli [5]. Moreover, the addition of anthocyanins could weakly enhance the antibacterial activity of films, except the CPZ-RE, which had no antibacterial activity against E. coli."
19,pH-sensitivity of films,"3.9 pH-sensitivity of films pH-sensitivity, an indispensable evaluation index for intelligent packaging, was investigated and the results were presented in Fig. 8 . As demonstrated in Fig. 8, CPZ-PPE films and CPZ-RE films were highly pH-sensitive and showed obvious visible color changes in pH 2 to pH 12 buffer solutions. The color changes of CPZ-PPE films ranged from pink (pH 2) > gray (pH 3 - pH 7) > green (pH 8 - pH 11) > yellow (pH 12). By contrast, the color changes of CPZ-RE films ranged from dark red (pH 2) > dark gray (pH 3 - pH 6) > dark blue (pH 7 - pH 11) > dark brown (pH 12). It was easy to observe that the color intensity increased with increasing concentration of extracts. In addition, the different color changes occurred between extract solutions (Fig. 1) and CPZ-PPE or CPZ-RE films (Fig. 8) in the same pH buffer solution level, which was attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonds in extract with CPZ, resulting in the changes of anthocyanins structure [26]. Color changes were easily observed by naked eyes when the ΔE value of above 3 [32]. According to Table 3, the ΔE values of CPZ-PPE II film and CPZ-RE II film were observed in a wide pH range, having fewer pH limitations than other films (ΔE value of above 3). That was to say, CPZ-PPE II film and CPZ-RE II film were more suitable for monitoring food freshness in real time as pH indicator than other film samples. Color changes were easily observed by naked eyes when the ΔE value of above 3 [32]. According to Table 3, the ΔE values of CPZ-PPE II film and CPZ-RE II film were observed in a wide pH range, having fewer pH limitations than other films (ΔE value of above 3). That was to say, CPZ-PPE II film and CPZ-RE II film were more suitable for monitoring food freshness in real time as pH indicator than other film samples."
20,Application of films for the shrimp spoilage,"3.10 Application of films for the shrimp spoilage The TVB-N content and pH value, two important parameters to evaluate the spoilage degree of shrimp, were measured and recorded (Fig. 9 ). According to Fig. 9, the initial pH value of the sample shrimps was 7.41 ± 0.01. The decrease in pH value at 4 d was attributed to the accumulation of lactic acid, which was produced by glycolysis [29]. And the increase in pH value later was due to the formation of ammonia caused by protein degradation and the release of volatile basic nitrogen [20]. According to Chinese standard for shrimp (GB 2733-2015), marine fish and shrimp were completely spoiled while the TVB-N value was beyond 30 mg/100 g. The TVB-N value was 9.43 ± 1.26 mg/100 g at 0 d then increased to 37.8 ± 2.42 mg/100 g at 4 d, indicating the shrimp became inedible. Based on the above results, CPZ-PPE II film was used to estimate the spoilage degree of shrimp because it exhibited better functional properties. Corresponding color changes of CPZ-PPE II film were photographed (Fig. 10 ). Distinguishable color changes were shown in CPZ-PPE II film: purple (0 d) > light blue (2 d) > light green (4/6/8 d). The trial results indicated that CPZ-PPE II film could effectively monitor spoilage degree of shrimp when film changed from purple to light green. Previous studies have illustrated the mechanism of intelligent films containing anthocyanins to monitor shrimp freshness: TVB-N which released from spoiled shrimp was absorbed by the films, resulting in the production of hydroxyl ions and the latter induced the color change of anthocyanins in film matrix [20,38]."
21,Conclusion,"In this study, CS/PVA/Nano-ZnO films, incorporated with various concentrations of PPE or RE, were successfully developed by a solution casting method. CPZ-PPE and CPZ-RE films exhibited visible color changes in different pH buffer solutions. When incorporated with PPE or RE, mechanical resistance of film was significantly enhanced (P < 0.05), while the moisture contents and flexibility of film significantly reduced (P < 0.05). Water vapor permeability (WVP) of film was not significantly influenced by the addition of PPE or RE (P > 0.05). CPZ-RE film exhibited darker color and lower light transmittance than CPZ-PPE film at the same incorporation level, which was due to different compositions and contents of anthocyanin. CPZ-PPE films exhibited higher antimicrobial activity against E. coli and S. aureus than CPZ-RE films. Moreover, film could effectively monitor the spoilage degree of shrimp in real time (i.e., CPZ-PPE II film). In conclusion, our results suggested CPZ-PPE and CPZ-RE films have promising potential as active and smart packaging materials for applications in food industry.
