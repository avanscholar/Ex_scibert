0,Introduction,"Global concern on major pollutants such as carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, nitrogen and sulfur oxides (NOx and SOx) and particulates resulting from use of fossil fuels and hydrocarbon based compounds for energy has led to intensive research works being conducted to develop better process options and identify alternative energy carriers. Since H2 is an environmentally clean energy, it is being projected as a potential energy carrier of the future, mainly for application in fuel cells as a source of power. H2 can be generated from hydrocarbon based compounds and derivatives such as ethanol, methanol, methane, gasoline, and biomass by the steam reforming process with water or by oxygen in the partial oxidation process with the assistance of adsorbents and/or catalysts [1–7], and also through coal gasification and water electrolysis [8–10]. Currently intensive research is being conducted around the world in H2 gas production for application in fuel cells as a source of power. Steam reforming is the most efficient and industrially applied process for H2 production and is achieved with many catalysts such as Rh, Ru, Pd, Pt, Cu, Co, with Ni the most often used due to its low cost and high activity [11–15]. In-situ adsorption of CO and CO2 gases by adsorbents such as CaO, layered double hydroxides, produced during the steam reforming reactions to obtain high purity H2 for application in fuel cells is also reported elsewhere [16–19]. Recently H2 generation from polymers such as polyethylene (PE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) by milling the polymer samples with CaO, Ca(OH)2, Ni(OH)2, and Ni-doped layered double hydroxide and heating at temperatures between 350 and 550°C was reported by the same authors [20–22]. Application of the same process for generation of H2 from cellulose is also reported [23] and this has been reported to be achieved with sufficient milling of polymer to with Ni(OH)2 to allow dispersion of nickel to the surface of polymers facilitating C–C bond rupture and as the mixtures are heated, CO2 released reacts with calcium provided allowing generation of hydrogen. It is known that when pyrolyzed, polymers such as PS, PE, PVC, etc., decompose into a wide range of hydrocarbons rather than hydrogen and carbon dioxide [24–26]. Even when a polymer and Ca(OH)2 are put together without milling operation, it is still difficult to obtain hydrogen since at such a low temperature at which hydrocarbons from polymers would not easily react with water from Ca(OH)2. Reaction Eqs. (2), (3) and (6), (7) for hydrogen formation are understood to proceed with solid state, mainly with carbonate formation, and this result from the presence of a catalyst in nickel, and generation of hydrogen due to catalytic effect is reported in literature [27–29]. Polystyrene (PS) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) samples were used in this work with Ca(OH)2 as CO2 adsorbent and Ni(OH)2 to offer Ni as catalyst and both hydroxides to offer water moles for the water–gas reactions."
1,Experimental,
2,Sample preparation,"2.1 Sample preparation Polystyrene [–CH2–CH(C6H5)–]n, poly(vinyl alcohol) [–CH(OH)CH2–]n, Ca(OH)2 and Ni(OH)2 chemical reagents were supplied by Wako Chemicals — Japan and were used as starting materials in this experiment. Ni(OH)2 and Ca(OH)2 were added to provide nickel (Ni) as catalyst (to assist C–C bond rupture) and calcium as adsorbent to fix CO2 generated during gasification, and water molecules in both hydroxides to assist in water–gas shift reaction. The starting samples were mixed as follows; PS–Ca(OH)2–Ni(OH)2 at a molar ratio of (1:8:1) and PVA–Ca(OH)2–Ni(OH)2 at a molar ratio of (1:2:1) with Ca(OH)2 moles selected based on number of carbon moles in each mole of the two polymers respectively. In separate batch tests a 3.0g mixture of PS or PVA and hydroxides were milled in a planetary ball mill (Pulverisette – 7, Fritsch, Germany), which has two mill pots (45cm3 inner volume each) made of ZrO2 with 7×15mm diameter ZrO2 balls to obtain mixed products for gasification. Mill speed in this work was kept constant at 700rpm and milling time at 60min."
3,Gasification and gas analysis,"2.2 Gasification and gas analysis TG/MS analysis was performed using a thermobalance connected to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Rigaku Thermo-Mass: Thermo plus TG-8120 with M-201QA). The measurements were carried out with helium gas at a flowrate of 300mL min−1. About 5mg of samples obtained from milling were heated from 20 to 700°C at a heating rate of 20°C min−1 in a platinum sample pan. A portion of the volatile products was led to the ion source of the mass spectrometer through a transfer line heated to 200°C and characteristic peaks of gases were evaluated using a computer/software connected to the equipment. A sample of 3.0g from the mixtures prepared by milling was put on a sample holder and placed in a glass tube connected to argon gas source and inserted in a furnace with discharge line for product gas collection. The sample in the furnace was heated to 500°C at a heating rate of 20°C min−1 and the product gases were collected through the discharge line between 400 and 500°C in aluminum packs. The product gases collected were analyzed for component gas concentrations using a Micro GC/QC system (Agilent Micro GC 3000A) with helium as carrier gas using Cerity QA/QC program in a computer. A molecular zeolite column referred to as A operated at a set temperature of 75°C and helium flowrate (carrier gas) at 2mL min−1 (30psi flow pressure) was used to analyze for H2, CO and CH4, while that for CO2 referred to as B is plot Q with operation temperature at 60°C and helium flowrate of 3.5mL min−1 (30psi flow pressure). A compact micro-electrochemical thermal conductivity detector referred to as TCD with an internal volume of 240nL was used inside."
4,Characterization of solids,"2.3 Characterization of solids X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out using Rigaku, RINT-2200/PC system with a CuKα irradiation source (λ =1.5405Å) at 40kV and 50mA for samples after milling and milled samples after heating at 500°C. Samples were analyzed in a continuous scan mode between 5 and 65° 2θ. Thermo-gravimetric analysis was conducted by a TG/DTA analyzer (Rigaku Thermo plus TG-8120) at a heating rate of 20°C min−1 in argon gas at a flowrate of 150mL min−1 to monitor decomposition profile of CaCO3 in solid product obtained at 500°C."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Hydrogen generation from polystyrene (PS),"3.1 Hydrogen generation from polystyrene (PS) TG–DTA and TG/MS patterns taken for the PS–Ca(OH)2–Ni(OH)2 sample mixture are shown in Fig. 1 . The first endothermic peak at 270°C is due to loss of water and the main endothermic peak at 400°C is due to both loss of water and release of H2, CO and CH4 gases. The other endothermic peak at 600°C corresponds to CO2, and this can be related to characteristic peaks of each gas on TG/MS profile on the same figure. To measure concentration of H2, CH4, CO, and CO2 gases produced during gasification, a 3.0g sample of the milled mixture of PS–Ca(OH)2–Ni(OH)2 was heated under argon gas environment and product gases collected at temperatures between 350 and 500°C. Table 1 shows gas analysis of PS–Ca(OH)2–Ni(OH)2 (1:8:1) sample mixture milled for 60min at 700rpm. Purity of H2 gas collected at (350–450°C) and (450–500°C) was consistently above 95% from a total gas (H2, CH4, CO, CO2) of 2.9 and 11.7% for the two temperature ranges respectively. Concentration of both CO and CO2 was below 1% and CH4 concentration was observed between 2 and 3%. Characterization of the milled product of PS–Ca(OH)2–Ni(OH)2 (1:8:1) mixture both before and after heating by XRD is shown in Fig. 2 . Milled mixture before heating shows characteristic peaks of Ca(OH)2 and Ni(OH)2 (Fig. 2(a)) as dominant phases. However, in Fig. 2(b) characteristic peaks of both CaCO3 and CaO clearly appear for the milled mixture heated under argon gas at 500°C. This shows that carbon oxides (CO, CO2) released during heating of the milled product between 350 and 500°C was adsorbed as CaCO3, allowing release of H2 gas as indicated by TG–MS and gas concentration data. Generation of H2 from hydrocarbon based compounds is well known and can be achieved by the steam reforming process with water Eq. (1). The likely reaction mechanisms based on the above data can be represented by the following equations; (1) C n H m + nH2O= nCO+(n +1/2m)H2 (2) C8H8 +8H2O=8CO+12H2 (primary) (3) C8H8 +16H2O=8CO2 +20H2 (secondary) (4) C+H2 =CH4 (methanation) (5) 8CO2 +8CaO=8CaCO3 (carbonation) Eqs. (2) and (3) represent primary and secondary water–gas reactions. One mole PS has 8 carbon moles in its structure (C8H8) so 8mol Ca(OH)2 is offered to fix the 8 carbon moles during gasification and 8mol H2O as represented by the primary water–gas reaction, Eq. (2). Secondary water–gas reaction Eq. (3) shows that 16mol H2O is required to convert 8 carbon moles to CO2 and with 4mol H2 in PS could produce 20mol H2. But in the current system, the two hydroxides only provide 9mol of H2O. The presence of CH4 in gas analysis indicates that reaction Eq. (4) co-exists during heating due to insufficient water moles. XRD patterns showing peaks of CaCO3 could be represented by reaction Eq. (5). The amount of CaCO3 formed at 500°C during heating for H2 gas of PS–Ca(OH)2–Ni(OH)2 sample mixture was investigated by TG–DTA, and data obtained is shown in Fig. 3 . An 11% weight loss up to 500°C is due to loss of water from decomposition of Ca(OH)2, indicated by XRD peaks on the same figure. Another 7% weight loss up to 800°C is due to decomposition of CaCO3, releasing CO2 which equates to about 16% CaCO3. The other 84% contained in the heated mixture is Ca(OH)2, CaO, followed by nickel and un-reacted hydrocarbon at 500°C."
7,Hydrogen generation from poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA),"3.2 Hydrogen generation from poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) TG–DTA and TG/MS patterns taken for the PVA–Ca(OH)2–Ni(OH)2 sample mixture are shown in Fig. 4 indicating H2, CO, CO2, and H2O as the main gaseous products. Endothermic peaks at 170°C and 300°C is due to loss of water and main endothermic peak at 390°C is due to release of both water and H2 gas and endothermic peak at 630°C relates to release of CO2 gas. The characteristic peaks of corresponding gases as shown by TG/MS profile on the same figure correspond well with TG–DTA data. H2 gas peak is clearly observed between 350 and 500°C with maximum intensity at 420°C. Peak of CO2 occurs after 550°C and reaching maximum at 640°C, clearly separated from H2 gas peak. Table 2 shows concentration of the product gases for PVA–Ca(OH)2–Ni(OH)2 (1:2:1) mixture milled for 60min at 700rpm and heated to 500°C. Purity of H2 gas at three different temperature ranges; (350–400°C), (400–500°C) and (500°C) was consistently above 98% with CO,CO2 and CH4 concentrations at around 1% or less. XRD analysis of the milled product of PVA–Ca(OH)2–Ni(OH)2 (1:2:1) mixture both before and after heating by XRD is shown in Fig. 5 . Milled mixture before heating shows characteristic peaks of Ca(OH)2 and Ni(OH)2 (Fig. 5(a)) as dominant phases. But, in Fig. 5(b) high intensity peaks of CaCO3 and that of CaO clearly appear for the milled mixture heated under argon gas at 500°C. This also shows that CO2 released during heating is fixed as CaCO3 as represented by Eq. (5). Likely primary and secondary water–gas reactions during hydrogenation of PVA could be represented by Eqs. (5) and (6). (6) C2H4 +2H2O=2CO+4H2 (primary) (7) C2H4 +4H2O=2CO2 +6H2 (secondary) There is a 2mol carbon in PVA structure and it requires a 4mol H2O to convert the carbon moles to CO2 resulting in production of 6mol H2, Eq. (6). However, in the current system 2mol Ca(OH)2 and 1mol (Ni(OH)2 offer a total of 3mol H2O. Fig. 6 shows TG–DTA profile of PS–Ca(OH)2–Ni(OH)2 mixture obtained at 500°C but this time heated to 1000°C and XRD pattern of mixture as obtained after heating at 500°C. An analysis of weight loss due to CaCO3 decomposition from TG–DTA pattern and two most high intensity peaks of CaCO3 and CaO respectively was performed to determine amount CaCO3 formed in the product. A 4% weight loss up to 500°C is due to loss of water from decomposition of Ca(OH)2, and another 16% weight loss up to 800°C is due to CaCO3 decomposition. Taking ratio of weight loss (16%) due to CaCO3 and 44% constituting CO2 in CaCO3 gives 36%. Evaluating intensity of highest peaks of CaCO3 and CaO gives 43%. The sample mixture heated to 500°C could contain (36–43)% CaCO3."
8,Conclusion,"Milling one of polystyrene (PS) or poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) with Ni(OH)2 and Ca(OH)2 followed by heating under argon/helium gas environments showed that H2 gas with concentrations over 95% can be produced. Findings in this work could be summarized as follows; 1. Milling of PS/PVA–Ca(OH)2–Ni(OH)2 samples allowed both nickel and calcium as catalyst and adsorbent respectively to be evenly dispersed onto polymer surfaces. Heating of the milled product generated H2, CH4, H2O, CO, and CO2 as the main gaseous products. 2. In PS–Ca(OH)2–Ni(OH)2 sample system, total gases collected reached 11.7% at 400–500°C with hydrogen purity over 95%. Concentration of CO and CO2 was consistently below 1%. 3. In PVA–Ca(OH)2–Ni(OH)2 sample system, total gases collected reached 31.3% between 400 and 500°C with hydrogen purity over 98%. Concentration of CO and CO2 was consistently below 0.5%. 4. The process investigated in this work clearly shows that H2 gas can be generated from polymers and/or hydrocarbon based compounds at temperatures below 550°C. At the same time CO2 generated is fixed as CaCO3 and does not require separate gas separation facilities. The process requires further development to increase H2 gas purity to over 99% and offer as an alternative process for treatment of waste plastics, biomass and/or combinations of solid based hydrocarbon compounds for H2 gas for possible use in fuel cell technology. Further work is in progress to broaden discussion on the process with a view to increasing H2 gas purity to be applied in fuel cell technologies, decide optimum raw material combinations to be used as feed, regeneration of catalyst (Ni) and reactant/adsorbent (Ca), provide a technical–economical evaluation of the process to validate its possible application and also to evaluate and improve conversion of polymers or hydrocarbon based compounds to dominantly gaseous form for high H2 generation."
