0,Introduction,"A change from the usage of fossil fuels towards renewable energies is imperative for every country because the former contribute to global climate change, environmental and health problems, and may result in energy dependency from other nations (IEA, 2016). Fermentative bio-alcohol production from syngas or carbon monoxide-rich waste gas is considered a promising technique for generating bioenergy from waste or renewable resources. Syngas fermentation has received a great deal of interest over recent years because of its advantages compared to the thermochemical Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process. The biological process takes place at near ambient temperature and pressure, there is no requirement of a fixed H2:CO ratio and it has been reported to be less sensitive to contaminants such as sulphur and tar, among others (Abubackar et al., 2011; Daniell et al., 2012; Kennes et al., 2016). Lignocellulosic waste materials as well as other feedstocks can be converted, through gasification, into a gaseous product, which is typically a H2:CO mixture along with the possible presence of some amounts of CO2, CH4, and N2 (Kirkels and Verbong, 2011). This mixture is called synthesis gas or syngas. In recent years, the use of flue gas from steel industries, with a similar composition as synthesis gas described above, has gained importance for syngas fermentation industries as well. The bioconversion process involves acetogenic bacteria that use the C1 gas molecules and hydrogen as their carbon or energy sources for growth and metabolites production by following the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, generating the intermediate compound, acetyl-CoA, which can subsequently be reduced to acetic acid as well as other organic acids and alcohols (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017a; Kennes et al., 2016). Several mesophilic acetogens such as Clostridium ljungdahlii, C. autoethanogenum, C. carboxidivorans and C. ragsdalei have commonly been used for biofuels production through gas fermentation (Bengelsdorf et al., 2013). They have the ability to modify their metabolism and produce acid or alcohol depending on the environment and culture conditions. These bacteria are characterized by two metabolic steps, an acidogenic step, during which bacterial growth occurs mainly, together with acids production and with little or no production of alcohols. However, in the next step, the solventogenic one, a given amount of alcohol(s) is produced from the accumulated acids or occasionally, to a lesser extent, directly from gas consumption. Mass transfer limitation of the gaseous substrates and a low cell density may be bottlenecks in syngas fermentation (van Groenestijn et al., 2013). As pointed out by Fernández-Naveira et al. (2017a), reporting solubility data at different temperatures, the solubilities of CO and H2 in aqueous phase are quite low in such anaerobic processes compared to the solubility of gases such as oxygen in aerobic fermentations. In this respect, some anaerobic biofilm reactor configurations have been tested in order to try to improve the gas-liquid mass transfer such as in the monolith biofilm reactor (Shen et al., 2014a) originally tested for aerobic waste gas treatment (Jin et al., 2006), the hollow fiber membrane biofilm reactor (Shen et al., 2014b), the rotating packed bed (Shen et al., 2017) and the trickle bed reactor (Devarapalli et al., 2017). These reactor configurations provide opportunities to maintain a high cell density with relatively high mass transfer efficiency. On the other hand, increasing the mixing rates or the use microspargers to feed the gas are two possibilities to enhance the mass transfer in continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR). Recently, the use of nanoparticles with varying surface properties and functional groups were tested to improve the gas–liquid mass transfer rates during syngas fermentation as well (Kim et al., 2014; Kim and Lee, 2016). On the other hand, pH is considered as a key influential environmental and operating factor in the syngas fermentation process (Abubackar et al., 2012; Ganigué et al., 2016). Lowering the pH below the optimum growth pH promotes solventogenesis, resulting in higher alcohol production. However, deviation from the optimal growth pH in-turn results in a reduced overall energetic yield from the process and unfavorable growth conditions. In order to eliminate or decrease the amount of acids in the final titer and to improve alcohol production from the process, without affecting the cell growth, a two-stage system (two bioreactors in series) was used in the present study, with the first stage (i.e., first bioreactor) operated under conditions that support growth and acid production (optimum growth pH and nutrient rich medium) (acidogenesis). In the second stage (i.e., second bioreactor) a lower pH was used, that supports solventogenesis. In this respect, only a few studies have been performed and reported so far on syngas fermentation using a combination of bioreactor systems, such as CSTR-CSTR (Kundiyana et al., 2011) or CSTR-BC (bubble column) (Richter et al., 2013). C. carboxidivorans is the most studied species for the conversion of CO-rich waste gases/syngas to ethanol and higher alcohols such as butanol and hexanol (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2016a,b; Shen et al., 2014a,b). It is one of the few bacteria known so far to produce higher alcohols from such gases. C. carboxidivorans can also metabolize carbohydrates but it exhibits a somewhat different bioconversion profile with such substrates compared to the gas fermentation process (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017c). An overview of its characteristics and bioreactor studies performed so far for the hexanol-butanol-ethanol (HBE) fermentation has recently been published (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017b). C. carboxidivorans is a unique bacterium that demonstrated to produce mixtures of C2, C4, C6 organic acids from syngas in a first stage followed by the production of alcohols such as ethanol, butanol and hexanol (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017b). In the present study, the effect of different aqueous nutrient medium flow rates on the growth and metabolic profile of C. carboxidivorans was evaluated in a two stage system (CSTR-CSTR) with continuous liquid and syngas feed."
1,Experimental section,
2,Microorganism,"2.1 Microorganism C. carboxidivorans P7 DSM 15243 was acquired from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (Braunschweig, Germany) and it was maintained at pH 5.75 with 100% CO as sole carbon substrate in a medium described previously (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017d). The detailed composition of the medium in terms of macronutrients, trace minerals and vitamins stock solutions can be found elsewhere (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017d). The medium composition is similar as in Tanner (2007), except for a non-consequential change in the amount of MESA in the vitamin solution."
3,Bioreactor operation with continuous syngas supply,"2.2 Bioreactor operation with continuous syngas supply The experiment was carried out in two 2-L New Brunswick Scientific BIOFLO 110 bioreactors in series with 1.2 L nutrient medium as working volume and with the syngas feed composed of CO:CO2:H2:N2 = 30:10:20:40 (vol%) and fed continuously as the gaseous substrate. Syngas was introduced separately into each bioreactor through a microsparger at a rate maintained at 10 ml/min using a mass flow controller (Aalborg GFC 17). The medium composition used for the experiment was the same as described in Section 2.1. The bioreactors with the medium were autoclaved without cysteine-HCl and vitamins, which were later added after cooling down the medium under continuous nitrogen flushing. The bioreactors were maintained at a constant temperature of 33 °C with a constant agitation speed of 250 rpm throughout the experiments. 6.5% of an actively growing culture of C. carboxydivorans, which was grown for 48 h under CO, was used as the inoculum and was aseptically transferred to the bioreactors after the latter had cooled down to room temperature. The pH of the medium inside the bioreactor was measured on-line and was regulated through the addition of either a 2 M NaOH solution or a 2 M HCl solution, fed by means of peristaltic pumps."
4,Bioreactor operation with continuous syngas and liquid feeding,"2.3 Bioreactor operation with continuous syngas and liquid feeding During the continuous stage, fresh nutrient medium was fed to bioreactor 1 from a nutrient tank (2 L) using a peristaltic pump, at different flow rates, as described hereafter. Four different liquid flow rates of 8.1, 15, 22 and 30 ml/h were tested to understand their effect on cell growth and product distribution (e.g., conversion to alcohols). The flow from bioreactor 1 to bioreactor 2 was adjusted at the required rate. A hollow fiber filter module – “Cellflo polyethersulfone” with 500 cm2 surface area and 0.2 µM pore size (Spectrum Laboratories, Inc., USA) was used to recycle the cell mass and was connected to bioreactor 2. The pumps used for feeding and recycling purposes were those that are inbuilt in the New Brunswick Scientific BIOFLO 110 module. Tygon tubing was used for feeding the liquid. Gas samples of 0.2 ml were taken from the outlet sampling port of both bioreactors to monitor the CO, H2 and CO2 concentrations. 2 ml liquid samples were periodically withdrawn from the reactors (once every 24 h) in order to measure the optical density (ODλ = 600 nm) and afterwards the samples were filtered with a syringe using a 0.22 µm PTFE-filter before analyzing the concentrations of soluble products."
5,Analytical equipment and measurement protocols,"2.4 Analytical equipment and measurement protocols Gas-phase CO concentrations were measured on an HP 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The GC was fitted with a 15 m HP-PLOT Molecular Sieve 5A column (ID: 0.53 mm, film thickness: 50 μm). The oven temperature was initially kept constant at 50 °C, for 5 min, and then raised by 20 °C min−1 for 2 min, to reach a final temperature of 90 °C. The temperature of the injection port and the detector were maintained constant at 150 °C. Helium was used as the carrier gas. Similarly, CO2 was analyzed on an HP 5890 gas chromatograph, equipped with a TCD. The injection, oven, and detection temperatures were maintained at 90, 25 and 100 °C, respectively. Water-soluble products such as VFAs (Volatile Fatty Acids) and alcohols, in the culture broth, were analyzed using a HPLC (HP1100, Agilent Co., USA) equipped with a supelcogel C-610 column having a UV detector at a wavelength of 210 nm and a refractive index detector (RID). The mobile phase was a 0.1% ortho-phosphoric acid solution fed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column temperature was set at 30 °C. Cell mass was estimated by measuring sample absorbance at a wavelength of 600 nm using a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Model U-200, Pacisa & Giralt, Madrid, Spain). The redox potential was monitored continuously using an Ag/AgCl reference electrode connected to a transmitter (M300, Mettler Toledo, Inc. USA) maintained inside the bioreactor."
6,Statistical analysis,"2.5 Statistical analysis The statistical software PAWS statistics 18.0 was used for data analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc test were employed to determine the significance differences between various liquid flow rates on total acid production, total alcohol production, and alcohol to acid ratio. Analyses were considered statistically significant at p < .05."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Initial start-up in batch mode,"3.1 Initial start-up in batch mode During the start-up period, the two bioreactors were first operated in batch mode for 7 days, to obtain sufficient amount of C. carboxydivorans cells, followed by continuous operation at different liquid flow rates of 8.1, 15, 22 and 30 ml/h and with the pHs maintained at 6 and 5 in bioreactor 1 and 2, respectively, as a higher pH is expected to stimulate acidogenesis (bioreactor 1) while a lower pH would stimulate solventogenesis (bioreactor 2) (Ganigué et al., 2016; Kennes et al., 2016). Firstly, both bioreactors with 1.2 L nutrient medium were inoculated with 78 ml of actively growing C. carboxidivorans biomass and the initial pHs were maintained at 5.75 in both systems. Syngas feeding was started in both bioreactors at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. On Day 5, after the biomass concentration stabilized, the pH of bioreactor 1 was increased to 6.0 while the pH of bioreactor 2 was decreased to 5.5. The pH of bioreactor 1 was then maintained at 6.0 for the rest of the experimental run (Fig. 1 ). Conversely, for the next two days, the pH of bioreactor 2 was decreased by 0.25 point on each day till it reached a value of 5.0. It was then maintained at that same pH level until the end of the experiment (Fig. 2 )."
9,Continuous liquid fed bioreactor operation at 15 ml/h,"3.2 Continuous liquid fed bioreactor operation at 15 ml/h On the 7th day, continuous feeding of liquid medium was started, initially at a flow rate of 15 ml/h that corresponds to a dilution rate of 0.011 h−1. After 6 days of operation at this flow rate, the latter was decreased to 8.1 ml/h (dilution rate of 0.0063 h−1). Then, after 5 days, the flow rate was increased to a maximum value of 30 ml/h (dilution rate = 0.023 h−1). However, a decrease in biomass concentration was observed within one day of operation, most likely due to partial washout from bioreactor 1 at this highest flow rate (Fig. 1). Significant washout was originally not expected at this flow rate. A maximum growth rate of about 0.0086 h−1 has typically been reported for that strain under batch conditions in a similar fermentation medium (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2016b), and 0.0072 h−1 has been reported in bioreactor studies with continuous gas feed (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017d). However, the presence or accumulation of end metabolites may inhibit biomass growth and maintenance, mainly higher alcohols such as butanol which was shown to result in 50% growth inhibition at concentrations around 14 g/L, with complete inhibition at 20 g/L (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2016b). Such high concentrations were, however, not yet reached here. Hence, the flow rate was again reduced to a value of 22 ml/h (D = 0.017 h−1) and was operated for five additional days under such conditions. During the initial (liquid) batch bioreactor operation, when only feeding syngas, at a flow rate of 10 ml/min, the cells in both bioreactors gradually started growing and their concentration stabilized. As expected, changing the pH from 5.75 to 6.0 in bioreactor 1 resulted in higher biomass accumulation and in bioreactor 2, the decrease in pH from 5.75 to 5.0 neither boosted biomass build-up nor harmed the biocatalyst. The optimum reported pH of C. carboxidivorans lies within that range (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017b; Liou et al., 2005), although the highest values are more favourable to growth. Acetic and butyric acids were the predominant VFAs produced during the batch mode stage of the bioreactors, reaching 5.2 and 0.6 g/L, respectively, in bioreactor 1 (Fig. 3 ), and 5.1 and 1.1 g/L, respectively, in bioreactor 2 (Fig. 4 ). This accounts for 99.25% and 96.8% of the total acids produced respectively, in bioreactor 1 and 2. Hexanoic acid started being produced at the late stage of the batch mode, which agrees with previously published data showing that metabolites are produced, chronologically, with increasing carbon numbers (C2 → C4 → C6) (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017d), which explains hexanoic acid production in the late stage in batch mode. It is then also the last compound appearing in continuous processes. Its continuous production may thus be expected to be affected by operating parameters such as the feed flow rate of the nutrient medium. In terms of alcohols, ethanol and butanol were produced as well; however, an increase of 138% in the total alcohol production was observed in bioreactor 2 compared to bioreactor 1. This can be easily attributed to the pH effect on the metabolic shift as lowering the pH promotes alcohol production in acetogenic bacteria as explained before (Abubackar et al., 2011), and thus stimulated alcohol production in the second bioreactor. On day 7, the continuous feed was started in order to study the effect of different flow rates on biomass growth and maintenance, and metabolites formation by C. carboxydivorans during syngas fermentation. The cell OD600 was 1.15 at 160 h in bioreactor 1 when the continuous operation started and when fresh nutrient medium was continuously added to that bioreactor at a rate of 15 ml/h (Fig. 1). The liquid effluent from bioreactor 1 was fed into bioreactor 2 while maintaining the same flow rate in both systems. Concurrently, the liquid from bioreactor 2 flowed out of the system by passing through a hollow fiber filter module, which allowed cell recycle back into that two stage system. This minimized loss of biomass in the second bioreactor in which the conditions are less favourable (e.g., low pH) to biomass growth than in bioreactor 1. During the operation at the flow rate of 15 ml/h, the average total acids and alcohols produced were 5.93 g/L and 0.33 g/L, respectively, in bioreactor 1 with acetic acid reaching the maximum concentration of 4.8 g/L (Fig. 3). However, the average total acids and alcohols during this period in bioreactor 2 (Fig. 4) were 4.24 and 1.19 g/L, respectively, confirming that acidogenesis was stimulated in bioreactor 1, while the conditions in bioreactor 2 were more favourable to solventogenesis, leading to higher concentrations of alcohols compared to the organic acids in the latter."
10,Continuous liquid fed bioreactor operation at 8.1 ml/h,"3.3 Continuous liquid fed bioreactor operation at 8.1 ml/h After the continuous operation at 15 ml/h, the flow rate was reduced to 8.1 ml/h and the full system was operated for several days under such conditions. During those days, the average total amount of acids and alcohols produced were, respectively, 7.71 and 0.53 g/L in bioreactor 1, and, respectively, 4.90 and 1.19 g/L in bioreactor 2. The maximum amount of respective acids were obtained at this lowest flow rate in bioreactor 1 and accounted for about 6.64, 1.66 and 0.73 g/L, respectively of acetic, butyric and hexanoic acids. It can be seen that conditions like the supply of fresh nutrients at a relatively low flow rate of 8.1 ml/h and a pH of 6 might be near optimal for the activity of the bacteria in terms of acids production. However, it is necessary to take into account that at a low flow rate the product removal rate and recovery from the bioreactors will also be less. Although a flow rate of 8.1 ml/h is optimal for acid production in bioreactor 1, reaching higher concentrations than in the batch mode, the amount acids obtained in bioreactor 2, under such conditions, is relatively lower than in its batch mode. The main reason for the low production of acids is the low pH, as lowering pH is more unfavourable to acidogenesis. It is also worth noting that operation under continuous mode increases the production of longer chain fatty acids (e.g., butyric, hexanoic acids) compared to the batch conditions."
11,Continuous liquid fed bioreactor operation at 30 and 22 ml/h,"3.4 Continuous liquid fed bioreactor operation at 30 and 22 ml/h On the 22nd day, the bioreactors were fed at a flow rate of 30 ml/h, which is the highest rate tested in this study, and a decrease in biomass concentration was observed in both bioreactors on the next day, most probably due to partial washout. The flow rate was then decreased to 22 ml/h and the system was operated under such conditions until the end of the experiment. It is also worth observing that higher alcohols, such as hexanol, only appeared in bioreactor 2, at low pH, stimulating solventogenesis, while that alcohol is not found at all in bioreactor 1 operated at higher pH, favourable to acidogenesis."
12,ANOVA and post hoc analysis,"3.5 ANOVA and post hoc analysis From the ANOVA results, it can be concluded that there was a statistically significant difference in total acid production (bioreactor 1: F(2,13) = 21.487, p = .000; bioreactor 2: F(2,13) = 4.692, p = .029), total alcohol production (bioreactor 1: F(2,13) = 70.216, p = .000; bioreactor 2: F(2,13) = 9.218, p = .003), and alcohol to acid ratio (bioreactor 1: F(2,13) = 28.738, p = .000; bioreactor 2: F(2,13) = 6.092, p = .014) between different flow rates tested in each bioreactor. The Multiple Comparisons (post hoc tests) revealed that there was no statistical significant difference between flow rates of 15 and 22 ml/h (p > .05) on total acid production in bioreactor 1. However, total alcohol production was significantly higher (p < .05) at a flow rate of 8.1 ml/h than 15 or 22 ml/h in bioreactor 1. For bioreactor 2, with a flow rate of 22 ml/h, the total alcohol production appeared to improve significantly (p < .05) compared to 8.1 or 15 ml/h. There was no significant (p > .05) difference between 8.1 and 15 ml/h as well as 15 and 22 ml/h in terms of alcohol/acid ratio in bioreactor 2."
13,Metabolites distribution under different operating conditions,"3.6 Metabolites distribution under different operating conditions Table 1 shows the distribution of metabolites at different flow rates, studied in both bioreactors. From many previous studies, it is known that the pH is one of the main parameters that influences the production of metabolites in acetogenic fermentation (Abubackar et al., 2012, 2016a; Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017d; Ganigué et al., 2016). An optimum growth pH allows the bacteria to produce more acids with comparatively less amount of alcohols, whereas, decreasing the pH to a lower value, around or below 5, significantly increases alcohol production. This effect is attributed to the stress environment created by a low pH where the bacteria overcome this by producing alcohols. Most bacteria maintain their internal or cytoplasmic pH within a narrow range by different mechanisms of pH homeostasis. This optimal pH range allows for optimal activity and for maintaining structural integrity of the cytoplasmic proteins and other biomolecules. During operation with continuous liquid feed, bacteria from bioreactor 1 were moving to bioreactor 2, which was maintained at a pH which is close to the acidic limit of their growth range. This creates a stress environment that causes partial loss of self-buffering as well as proton exporting capacity of the cells. This is termed “acid shock”. Another factor that disrupts pH homeostasis of the cells is due to accumulation of membrane-permeant acids such as fermentation acids. The accumulation occurs when the cytoplasmic pH is higher than the external pH of the cells. Low molecular weight fermentation acids with a pKa in the range of 3–5 get protonated at low external pH and easily cross the cell membrane. Once they reach the cytoplasm, where the pH is higher than the pKa, the acids get deprotonated resulting in acidification of the cytoplasm. This will lead to failure of pH homeostasis and cause retardation of growth. Bacteria under these stress conditions generate compounds that help them to survive at low pH values (Slonczewski et al., 2009). Reassimilation of acids and production of the corresponding alcohols is one of the mechanisms that bacteria adopt to reestablish pH homeostasis. In addition, the charge of cell membranes also depends on the pH of the medium which in turn affects nutrient absorption by the cell and thereby affects the activity of enzymes. From previously published research on two different clostridia, C. autoethanogenum and C. carboxidivorans, this effect of pH was also clearly observed (Abubackar et al., 2016a; Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017d). In one of our previous studies, by using an optimized medium and fermentation at a low pH of 4.75, C. autoethanogenum triggered only alcohol production without the accumulation of any acid (Abubackar et al., 2015). In the cited reference, acetic acid accumulated during the initial fermentation stage at high pH, and it was consumed and converted to ethanol when the pH of the fermentation broth was shifted to a lower value of 4.75. However, in the present study, it can be observed from Table 1 that, in addition to pH, the liquid flow rate also influenced the composition of the medium collected at the outlet of the bioreactors. In bioreactor 1, increasing the flow rate decreased the alcohols to acids ratio. High flow rates allow the bacteria to receive more nutrients, which helps for their growth and maintenance favourable for acid production. This could explain the low alcohols to acids ratio at such low flow rates. Conversely, in bioreactor 2, such ratio improved with increasing flow rates. The maximum alcohols/acids ratio of 0.32 was obtained in bioreactor 2 at a flow rate of 22 ml/h, i.e. at the highest dilution rate. Increasing the flow rates implies that more liquid flows through and out of the reactors along with accumulated products. However, at such higher flow rate of 22 ml/h, the highest average total alcohols production of 1.51 g/L was attained compared to other, lower, flow rates studied. This does also result in a lower alcohols/acids ratio in the first bioreactor, leading to the highest proportion of acids in bioreactor 1 with a simultaneous high proportion of alcohols in bioreactor 2. Thus, it can be concluded that the rate of conversion of acids into alcohols at a flow rate of 22 ml/h is higher than at 8.1 and 15 ml/h. A low flow rate provides higher hydraulic retention time (HRT). In addition to ethanol and butanol, the highest amount of hexanol was also found at a flow rate of 22 ml/h. Generally, higher alcohols have a higher commercial value than ethanol. From the industrial point of view, lab-scale continuous production studies are often a prerequisite for designing large scale production plants. For syngas fermentation, a two stage continuous system may be recommended compared to the single stage one, as the use of the former system allows to separate acidogenesis and solventogensis of acetogens in two different bioreactors connected in series, providing optimized conditions for either one bioconversion process or the other in each vessel. Maintaining an optimal growth pH in the first bioreactor allows the bacteria to grow along with acids production, although some alcohols are produced, at low concentrations, in that first stage as well, which agrees with some other previous reports confirming that some alcohols can be produced simultaneously with acids during the acidogenic stage (i.e., at a high pH) (Abubackar et al., 2016b). These acids, e.g., acetic acid, butyric acid and hexanoic acid, are then converted partially or completely into their corresponding alcohols, i.e. ethanol, butanol and hexanol, in the second bioreactor, which is operated at low pH, favourable to solventogenesis. Contrary to what happens during the acidogenic stage (bioreactor 1), generally during solventogenesis (bioreactor 2) only alcohols are produced while acids are being consumed. This can clearly be seen in Fig. 3 (bioreactor 1) and Fig. 4 (bioreactor 2), as the concentrations of acids are always lower in the 2nd bioreactor compared to the first one, confirming that acids from the first bioreactor are consumed in the second one, while there is no net production of acids in bioreactor 2. Several studies have reported the effect of different pHs on the production of alcohols (Kennes et al., 2016). Some previous studies also suggested that increasing pH inhibits or reduces alcohol production; however, at lower pHs the produced acids are re-assimilated and subsequently converted to alcohols, as a defense reaction of the microorganisms in order to avoid inhibition by such acids. Most of the reported syngas fermentation studies were performed in batch systems (in terms of liquid phase) either in serum bottles or in stirred tank reactors (Cotter et al., 2009; Younesi et al., 2005). In those studies, inhibition due to the accumulation of metabolites is one among other parameters that could influence the substrate bioconversion efficiency and biomass production as well as the final titers reached in the process. As mentioned above, this was observed from the study reported on ethanol and butanol toxicity effects on C. carboxydivorans (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2016b). In that study it was shown that the growth rate gradually decreased on increasing the butanol concentrations in the bottles. This trend was also observed with ethanol to some extent, though ethanol is less inhibitory to acetogens at high concentrations than butanol. Thus, it is advisable to perform syngas fermentation in continuous bioreactors in a two stage system. The low concentration of alcohols in bioreactor 1 does not, or hardly, inhibit biomass growth and maintenance in that first bioreactor, in which biomass growth is linked to the acidogenic stage. The low culture pH combined with the continuous flow of liquid in bioreactor 2, and the absence of biomass growth during the solventogenic stage in that reactor, requires including some system that allows retention of enough biomass inside bioreactor 2. This issue was addressed by using a cell (biomass) recycling unit that reduces, to some extent, the loss of cells from the bioreactor and recycles bacterial biomass back into the system. In some of our previous studies it was observed that maintaining a relatively high biomass concentration in a suspended-growth bioreactor at low pH was not possible under long term experimental runs (Abubackar et al., 2016a). Under such conditions, if biomass is not retained by any means, the experiments need to be terminated within a short period of time of one to two weeks. A lower pH stalls or decreases the flow of carbon and electrons from the substrate towards the cell, thereby causing damage to cells. In the present study, the biomass concentration could be maintained at an OD600 around 1, thanks to the cell recycling unit. From all the above results, it can be observed how the flow rate had a significant effect on the production of both acids and alcohols. Only very few studies have reported on two stage continuous systems for syngas fermentation. All used dilution rates similar to those reported in this study. Hybrid reactors with two CSTRs in series and CSTR-bubble column reactors were tested in this respect. Other reported assays were done with acetic acid and ethanol producing strains, while several organic acids (i.e. acetic, butyric, hexanoic acids) as well as the production of higher alcohols, besides ethanol, is possible in the present study with C. carboxydivorans. This results in a more complex process, which is more difficult to optimize under continuous operating conditions, due to the presence of such mixtures of acids and alcohols. Besides, previously reported batch assays (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017d) have shown that the organic acids are not produced simultaneously in such conditions. The same is true for the alcohols. Short chain metabolites are produced first in C. carboxydivorans (C2 → C4 → C6) and usually at higher rates and it was observed, in batch system, that there might be some overlap between the production of acids and alcohols during the acidogenic stage. The set-up of further optimization assays is therefore warranted. Once produced, the metabolites need to be recovered. Although this would still need to be optimized, separation processes commonly used in similar fermentation processes could be applied, such as those reported for the ABE fermentation, among others (Kennes et al., 2016)."
14,Conclusions,"It was observed that alcohols to acids ratios increase with increasing the flow rates in bioreactor 2, where the conditions are maintained to enhance solventogenesis. However, the ratio decreases when increasing the flow rates in the acidogenic bioreactor (bioreactor 1). Coupling a membrane module to bioreactor 2, where the conditions are not optimal for growth, helps maintaining sufficient cells required for the conversion of carboxylic acids into their respective alcohols. It can be concluded that in continuous syngas fermentation, the medium pH and flow rate play a significant role in the accumulation of products at the end of the process."
