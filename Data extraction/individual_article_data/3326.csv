0,Introduction,"Catalytic and electrocatalytic reactions on Pt group metals in the aqueous phase are important for carbon neutral pathways to fuels and chemicals [1,2–4]. Understanding the reaction mechanisms involved in these transformations is important to improving catalytic reaction rates, either by controlling reaction conditions to maximize rates on a given catalyst, or selecting new catalysts that have better properties, leading to higher activity. Thermal catalytic hydrogenation (TCH) of organics on metal surfaces in gas phase tend to proceed through a hydrogen atom addition, in which an adsorbed surface hydrogen (H*) reacts with an adsorbed organic molecule [5]. The same mechanism has been proposed to occur in aqueous phase TCH [1] and for electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) on metals with low hydrogen overvoltage (e.g., Pt, Rh, Pd) [6–8]. Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol on platinum group metals appears to follow this mechanism, because catalysts share similar activation energies and product distributions to TCH [9–11]. If TCH and ECH follow the same mechanism, the main difference in conversion rates between ECH and TCH must be caused either by different coverages of H* (and its effect on organic coverage) or by a change in electronic properties of the metal catalyst by the applied potential. Since XANES of Pt has shown only subtle changes in the electronic properties [12], this second explanation seems unlikely. The H* coverage is determined by the H2 pressure for TCH and by the activity of hydronium ions near the electrode surface and the external electric potential for ECH. Benzaldehyde hydrogenation to benzyl alcohol on platinum group metals behaves differently than phenol, in that the activation energy in ECH is 7 kJ mol−1 lower than in TCH for Pt, Pd and Rh [13]. ECH of benzaldehyde is also interesting in that it has higher current selectivity than phenol towards ECH vs. H2 evolution, particularly for Pd (~99% towards ECH). In contrast, Pd has extremely low activity for phenol hydrogenation (both TCH and ECH) compared to Pt or Rh [14]. The reason for the low activity for phenol ECH/TCH on Pd compared to Pt or Rh is unclear, since benzaldehyde ECH or TCH on Pd is comparably fast or faster than on Pt or Rh. One possible reason for the low TCH or ECH phenol activity on Pd may be a different reaction pathway for phenol hydrogenation on Pd compared to Pt as supported by calculations, which showed that hydrogenation on Pd(1 1 1) proceeds through a phenoxy intermediate rather than the direct hydrogenation route as predicted for Pt(1 1 1) [15]. Here we propose instead that the different Pd structure observed during benzaldehyde hydrogenation (metallic Pd) than phenol hydrogenation (β palladium hydride) causes this difference in reactivity. The present study clarifies the reaction kinetics and mechanism of phenol and benzaldehyde ECH and TCH over the platinum group metals, Pt, Pd and Rh. This is done by measuring and comparing TCH and ECH rates, selectivities, activation energies and reaction orders with respect to the organic species and hydrogen on Pt/C, Pd/C and Rh/C catalysts, and by measuring the surface species and catalyst structure under reaction conditions for Pd/C catalysts using XAFS and XANES. Two main research questions are addressed here: (i) Can a mechanism involving adsorbed H addition to an adsorbed organic species as the rate-limiting step capture the observed kinetic behavior, including the positive reaction orders (~1) in benzaldehyde reported for benzaldehyde ECH on Pt and Rh, and the reaction order near zero reported for Pd? [13] (ii) Why does Pd behave differently than Pt and Rh with respect to benzaldehyde and phenol hydrogenation kinetics? To this goal, we measure the reaction orders in organic species for Pt/C and Pd/C ECH and TCH, to determine how organic concentrations (and thus coverages) affect the rates. We compare these results to previous results in the literature, varying concentrations here over a wider range to detect changes in reaction rate that are not measurable with minor concentration changes. We also perform in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy including X-ray absorption near edge (XANES), and extended fine structure (EXAFS), cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance measurements to estimate the coverages of the adsorbed organic species and hydrogen on Pd/C to help determine how these coverages affect the rates in both ECH and TCH. For Pt/C, we favorably compare the adsorption equilibrium constants of phenol and benzaldehyde used in our kinetic model for the concentration-dependent rates to our previous direct measurements of these equilibrium constants on Pt surfaces [16]. This also helps to test a recently proposed [17] Eley-Rideal mechanism for ECH of benzaldehyde on Pd based on absence of a negative reaction order with respect to benzaldehyde concentrations at the concentrations studied."
1,Experimental,
2,TCH of phenol with Pd/C and Pt/C and fitting to reaction model,"2.1 TCH of phenol with Pd/C and Pt/C and fitting to reaction model Thermal catalytic hydrogenation of phenol was carried out by reducing the catalyst (Pt/C or Pd/C) in water, while sparging H2 under stirring at 500 rpm, then introducing phenol into the sealed glass reactor cell under flow of hydrogen at 1 bar. Aliquots of 1 mL of solution were sampled periodically. To test the aliquots, the dissolved organic products and reactants in the aqueous solution were extracted into dichloromethane with a dimethoxybenzene internal standard and then measured by gas chromatography to calculate conversion as a function of time (example in Fig. S1). The flow rate of H2 was varied and did not show change in the measured turnover frequencies. Turnover frequencies (TOFs) were calculated by normalizing to the number of surface metal sites measured by H2 chemisorption. The rate constant (kLH,c ), KA and KHCH in the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model were fitted to the measured TOFs as a function of phenol concentration by the method of least squares."
3,ECH of benzaldehyde with Pd/C,"2.2 ECH of benzaldehyde with Pd/C Benzaldehyde was reacted in an electrocatalytic cell. The cell has been described in detail elsewhere [9]. The compartment containing the working electrode/reference electrode and the compartment with the counter electrode (Pt wire) were separated by a Nafion membrane. The double junction silver/silver chloride reference electrode was calibrated vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using a Pt wire with 1 bar H2 bubbled into solution. A SP-150 Biologic potentiostat was used to control the potential and the resistance (measured using impedance spectroscopy). Resistance was compensated during runs by 85%, with the remaining 15% corrected afterwards (see Supporting Information). Aliquots of 1 mL were extracted from the cell, and tested in the same manner as for TCH (example shown in Fig. S2). Acetate buffer (pH 5) was used as supporting electrolyte."
4,Pd foil cyclic voltammetry,"2.3 Pd foil cyclic voltammetry A Pd foil was used for cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments (see Supporting Information) because a CV of the 5 wt% Pd/C catalyst at potentials above the potential for hydrogen evolution (HER) did not show evidence of hydrogen underpotential deposition (Hupd) or current that could be attributed to bulk hydride formation due to the high background capacitance of carbon at the low metal loadings. The 0.025 mm-thick Pd foil (Sigma Aldrich) of dimensions 0.5 cm × 1 cm (immersed in acetate buffer electrolyte, pH 5 electrolyte) was cleaned by flame annealing followed by rinsing in Millipore water, then electrochemically cleaned by multiple sweeps from −1 V to 1.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl in acetate buffer. The cleaned Pd foil was then cycled in the range of −0.4 V to 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl in solution with no organics, in a cell that had been cleaned to ensure no trace organics were present. A separate glass cell was used for cyclic voltammetry to prevent contamination by benzaldehyde or phenol residue from ECH runs. The potential range was selected to be above 0 V vs. RHE (~-0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl is 0 V vs. RHE at pH 5) to avoid H2 evolution and hydrogenation of the organic. Organics were introduced at varying concentrations into the cell and the cyclic voltammograms were repeated. The potentiostat and calibrated reference electrode used for ECH were also used for CV experiments."
5,Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of Pt and Pd,2.4 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of Pt and Pd Details of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) on a polycrystalline Pd and Pt disk in the presence of phenol and benzaldehyde to determine the effect of organics on capacitance and charge transfer resistance are discussed in the Supporting Information.
6,X-ray absorption spectroscopy of Pd/C,"2.5 X-ray absorption spectroscopy of Pd/C An electrochemical flow cell designed for X-ray absorption spectroscopy was used with a silver/silver chloride reference electrode. Details of the cell are reported elsewhere [12]. Electrolyte was flowed at 0.5 mL min−1 past a carbon felt loaded with Pd/C catalyst separated from the carbon counter electrode by a Nafion membrane. The working electrode was prepared by loading the catalyst onto a carbon felt. Degassed electrolyte was flowed through the cell to remove air pockets and during measurement to remove generated hydrogen or small traces of oxygen. The Pd/C catalyst was oxidized then reduced for 20 min to clean the surface after being loaded and exposed to electrolyte to remove adventitious carbon and surface oxide layer, respectively. Experiments were conducted at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne beamline, Sector 20 BM."
7,X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy peak fitting,"2.6 X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy peak fitting X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) that covered a broad energy range were background subtracted, normalized, and calibrated using ATHENA software [18]. The narrower-range (faster scan) XANES spectra (negative log of IT/I0, giving the X-ray absorption coefficient for the sample, µ(E)) were unnormalized and fit using an iterative solver minimizing the sum of least squared differences of two Gaussian peaks overlayed with a linear baseline compared to the spectra. The shift in Gaussian peak location (the higher energy value of these two peaks) was used to identify the transition of the Pd catalyst to a β-PdHx."
8,Extended X-ray absorption fine structure fitting,"2.7 Extended X-ray absorption fine structure fitting Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) fitting was done using ARTEMIS [18,19], with FEFF9 [20] theoretical standards as input. EXAFS spectra fitting was done with the first four Pd-Pd single shells and two multiscattering Pd-Pd shells, as well as two Pd-C pathways at different Pd-C distances. Due to noise in the data, Pd-C CN and Debye-Waller factor had very high uncertainty for some samples, and so a constant Debye-Waller of 0.005 Å2 was used based on instances where data quality was higher. The Pd-C coordination numbers of both paths were fit using a single variable. S0 2 (Amplitude reduction factor) = 0.7975, ΔE0 = -2.118 eV were used for fits based on the reference Pd foil spectra taken concurrently with the Pd/C samples. The approach of fitting using Pd-C was drawn from previous work with Pt/C with phenol [12] and benzaldehyde [16]."
9,Results,
10,"ECH and TCH of phenol and benzaldehyde on Pt, Rh and Pd supported on carbon","3.1 ECH and TCH of phenol and benzaldehyde on Pt, Rh and Pd supported on carbon We summarize first our new and previously reported aqueous-phase hydrogenation rate and selectivity measurements. The TOFs of TCH and ECH of phenol and benzaldehyde on carbon-supported Pt, Rh and Pd measured and those from the literature [9,10,13,14] are summarized in Table 1 . The hydrogenation products from phenol were cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol formed in series, with >95% combined selectivity. Under the reaction conditions studied, the conversion of cyclohexanone to cyclohexanol had a slightly slower rate than the conversion of phenol to cyclohexanone, so that cyclohexanone was the dominant product at the low conversions used in the rate measurements below (i.e., Tables 1 and 2 and Figs. 1 and 2 ). The sole product observed from benzaldehyde was benzyl alcohol with >95% selectivity. The Faradaic efficiency to ECH (the current utilized towards hydrogenation of phenol and benzaldehyde rather than H2 production) is shown in Table 1. Both phenol and benzaldehyde are converted rapidly on Pt and Rh in TCH and ECH. Phenol, in contrast, is converted slowly on Pd. (Phenol’s ECH activity on Pd was too low to be measured accurately, including our attempts in this work, which were measured for shorter times than TCH and set the TOF for ECH at <0.002 s−1.) Despite low phenol ECH activity compared to Pt and Rh, Pd is more active for ECH of benzaldehyde than Pt or Rh. No evidence for products involving C-C bond cleavage was observed in our results or those reported in Refs. [9,10,13,14]. Also, if C-C cleavage happened and it produced large coverages of strongly-adsorbed products like CO and phenyl, then the equilibrium constants for phenol and benzaldehyde adsorption obtained from the kinetic modelling below would not agree with those measured independently, as we find below. On Pd, the Faradaic efficiency of ECH was very high for benzaldehyde (99%, Table 1), but low for phenol. The Faradaic efficiency of ECH of benzaldehyde and phenol were similar on Pt, and both lower than ECH of benzaldehyde on Pd. The total reduction current during benzaldehyde ECH (sum of the currents towards H2 and ECH) was similar for Pt and Pd [13], indicating that ~50x less H2 is evolved during ECH of benzaldehyde on Pd than on Pt. (Approximately 1% of the current is used to reduce hydronium ions to H2 on Pd while ~50% goes to H2 on Pt.) Despite the low activity of Pd for phenol ECH, the total reduction current was similar to that of benzaldehyde ECH on Pd, suggesting that adsorbed H (H*) are produced and react at similar rates, but a much larger fraction of these react with benzaldehyde than with phenol."
11,ECH and TCH rates as a function of temperature and concentration with comparison to reaction model,"3.2 ECH and TCH rates as a function of temperature and concentration with comparison to reaction model We now summarize the effects of organic concentrations, H2 pressure and temperature on the rates, and fit some of these data to a Langmuir-Hinshelwood microkinetic model, which assumes that the rate-determining step is the addition of an adsorbed hydrogen to the adsorbed organic. This type of model was already used successfully to explain the effect of pH on the TCH rate for phenol over Pt/C, which results from the known change in adsorbed hydrogen stability with pH [21]. Further comparison of this model to the data is presented later in this paper. The effect of organic concentration at different H2 pressures (for TCH) or applied potentials (for ECH) is shown in Fig. 1. The reaction orders at 20 mM and apparent activation energies for phenol and benzaldehyde TCH and ECH measured in this work and from literature are compiled in Table 2. Under TCH conditions at 1 bar, the order in H2 was approximately 1 for all cases [9,10,13]. For Pd and Pt TCH of phenol, the TOFs over a wider range of phenol concentrations are shown in Fig. 2. Benzaldehyde solubility in water (<50 mM at 298 K) limits the range of concentrations that can be tested for benzaldehyde TCH and ECH. TCH of phenol on Pd/C initially increased in rate with increasing concentration of phenol (20–200 mM), but then has an increasingly negative order in phenol at higher concentrations (>200 mM) (Fig. 2a). This negative order indicates that adsorbed phenol blocks Pd sites at sufficiently high coverages. The data for all three metals and both organics are interpreted using a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, in which the surface hydrogenation (addition of an adsorbed H atom to the adsorbed organic) is rate-limiting. A fit of the data to the quantitative reaction rate equation described below (and derived in the SI) is shown in Fig. 2a for phenol hydrogenation over Pd. KA refers to the adsorption coefficient of phenol on the Pd surface, CA is the phenolaq concentration (relative to the standard concentration of 1 M), and KH similarly refers to H adsorption and CH is the aqueous hydrogen concentration (the standard state for CH is explained below). We use CH rather than hydrogen pressure, P H 2 , here to express the effective aqueous hydrogen concentration (or activity) for both ECH and TCH, thereby allowing both H+ aq and H2,aq to be treated with the same rate equations in the SI. As discussed in the SI, during TCH, CH is really an “effective first-order concentration” actually given by CH = ( P H 2 / ( 1 b a r ) )1/2 in TCH, whereas in ECH, CH is just the concentration of H+ aq (divided by 1 M). In both TCH and ECH, KH is defined as the equilibrium H* coverage divided by this CH thus defined. Note that KH in ECH should increase exponentially with decreasing applied potential (i.e., approximately following the Nernst equation, as described in the Supporting Information), and is thus much larger in value under the ECH conditions studied here than under the TCH conditions at 1 bar H2. Based on the value for KA of 38 from the fit, 50% coverage in phenol may be expected around 0.09 M phenol (including competition with hydrogen within this model). The rate of TCH of phenol on Pt is shown in Fig. 2b for a range of initial concentrations from 6 mM to 1.62 M. Over this wide concentration range, the reaction order changed as was observed for Pd. The rate increased with phenol concentration until it reached a maximum, after which the rate decreased. The order was ~0.6 at 20 mM phenol in Fig. 2b (based on the reaction model fit to the experimental data), whereas prior reports stated that the order in phenol concentration was ~0.3 at the same conditions [22]. We attribute this difference to the very narrow phenol concentration range explored in the previous report. Our own more recent measurements for TCH of phenol on Pt/C8 covered such a small concentration drop with time (only 39%) that the data are equally well fit by orders of 0 and 0.5 (relative standard deviations of 2.7% and 3.1%, respectively). For similar reasons, we omit from Table 2 the previously reported order for phenol ECH over Pt [22]. The measurements in Fig. 2b cover a much wider concentration range and are far more accurate. Although previously at high phenol concentrations (~160 mM) [10], a negative order in phenol was not observed for TCH on Pt/C, as is observed in Fig. 2b, those measurements were at higher H2 pressure (20 bar), where H2 would compete for sites more effectively than at 1 bar (Fig. 2b). We show below that a simple Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism with competitive adsorption of the two reactants can be used to approximately describe the behavior in Fig. 2, and those previous results. We also show that the adsorption equilibrium constants for phenol and benzaldehyde needed in these models for Pt/C are consistent with our independent measurements of these on Pt surfaces [16], if we assume that the hydrogenation reactions occur mainly on (1 1 1)-like facets and not at steps or (1 1 0)/(1 0 0)-like sites. This assumption was suggested by the observation that larger Pt particles are more active per unit Pt area [22]. Under ECH conditions, benzaldehyde ECH is first order in benzaldehyde concentration on Pt and Rh and zero order on Pd [13]. Another difference between Pd and Rh or Pt for ECH of benzaldehyde is that as the overpotential is increased for benzaldehyde ECH (from −0.6 V to −0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl in Fig. 1d), Pd goes from being comparable in rate to Pt and Rh to being ~4x more active (at 20 mM benzaldehyde). The implications of these differences will be discussed further below. The activation energy for ECH and TCH are similar for phenol for Pt and Rh, but ECH of benzaldehyde has a 7 kJ mol−1 lower activation energy than TCH for Pt, Rh and Pd."
12,Cyclic voltammetry of Pd and Pt in presence of phenol or benzaldehyde,"3.3 Cyclic voltammetry of Pd and Pt in presence of phenol or benzaldehyde We have previously used cyclic voltammetry on a well-annealed Pt wire to determine how the coverage of adsorbed phenol and benzaldehyde on Pt increases with their aqueous-phase concentrations [16]. This was done by measuring the corresponding decrease in the so-called Hupd current associated with adsorbing (and removing) adsorbed H. In the Supporting Information, we present a similar type study using a Pd foil. This is more complex, since the adsorption of H+ to make H* does not stop at ~1 monolayer as it does for Pt, but also produces H dissolved in the bulk of Pd and even Pd hydride. The results nevertheless reveal the concentration ranges where phenol and benzaldehyde adsorb onto Pd (Fig. S4). From that, it is easy to conclude that the Pd surface binds benzaldehyde considerably more strongly than phenol."
13,In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and EIS measurements in the presence of benzaldehyde or phenol,"3.4 In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and EIS measurements in the presence of benzaldehyde or phenol We summarize here our in situ spectroscopic and EIS measurements of adsorbed species on Pd and Pt, and the effects of organic concentrations on the transition of Pd to Pd hydrides. Our previous work with both X-ray absorption near edge (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) on Pt/C in the presence of phenol [12,16] and benzaldehyde [16] were used to probe the coverages of H and organics on the surface under reaction conditions. These results confirmed earlier reports that on Pt, the rate of phenol hydrogenation is controlled by the surface hydrogenation of adsorbed phenol [12]. Detection of adsorbed organic and hydrogen also showed that the organic and hydrogen appear to compete for sites on the Pt surface [12,16]. XANES and EXAFS can be used to identify the relevant Pd phases including Pd oxide, the β Pd hydride phase (which we will refer to as β-PdHx, where x is >0.58 for bulk Pd [23], and has been reported to be as low as 0.4 for Pd/C nanoparticles [24]), and α-PdHx (the H-lean solid phase I I The α-PdHx is a material that has Pd metal with a low concentration of dissolved H (H:Pd < 0.03 for bulk Pd at 298 K but H:Pd up to 0.5 above 570 K) and is referred by many authors as the “α-Pd-hydride phase” [58]. where x < 0.03 for bulk Pd at 298 K, but x < 0.15 for nanoparticles [24] and x up to >0.5 for bulk Pd above 570 K). Although Pd nanoparticles show separate hydride phases at >2 nm sizes, the relationship between x and the phase transition onset varies compared to that of bulk Pd, as discussed in the SI [23,24]. XANES in particular has been used to discriminate between the formation of a palladium carbide versus the Pd hydride even though EXAFS and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) cannot [25]. (Both XRD and EXAFS only detect resultant Pd structural changes such as the Pd-Pd distance, while XANES detects electronic effects due to Pd-C.) The two prominent Pd K-edge XANES peaks have been used to rapidly discriminate between the α-PdHx or β-PdHx phases on a ~4 nm Pd/C electrocatalyst in the presence of CO2 [26]. A scan of the Pd K-edge (Fig. 3 a) shows the major change in XANES between a partially oxidized Pd/C sample compared to one that has been reduced at −0.55 V. As mentioned, Fig. 3b shows the shifts in the two XANES peak energies that are used to distinguish the β-PdHx from that of the Pd metal (such as Pd foil) or α-PdHx. By acquiring short energy scans in the region of these two XANES peaks while varying the cell potential, a rapid determination of the Pd state is obtained [25–27]. As shown in Fig. 3b, the Pd metal converts to a β-PdHx at more negative potentials as the first peak at ~24369 eV shifts 1 eV negative and becomes more narrow, while the second peak at 24390 eV shifts slightly negative. If this were formation of a carbide, the peak at ~24369 eV would shift positive by 1 eV and become broader [25]. Thus, this shift is primarily attributed to the formation of the β-PdHx. In lieu of a full EXAFS scan, this method allows rapid probing of the catalyst phase during a sweep of the potential. The decrease in µ(E) (absorption coefficient) for peaks taken at more negative potential is caused by the increase in X-ray transmission that varies with increasing H2 concentration in the solution (see Supporting Information). The location of the XANES peak at ~24390 eV is plotted in Fig. 4 as the applied potential is swept cathodically (scan rate 0.6 mV/s), and shows the change in the catalyst from a Pd metal or α-PdHx to the β-PdHx. From this, it is evident that there is a transition from α-PdHx to β-PdHx at −0.55 to −0.60 V vs. Ag/AgCl in acetate buffer, which can be reversed by returning to more positive potentials (Fig. S3a). If phenol is present, this transition occurs at approximately the same potential (Fig. 4). In the presence of benzaldehyde, the formation of β-PdHx is inhibited (Fig. 4), even though the amount of charge (integrated current) passed during the negative potential sweep is more than sufficient to completely convert to β-PdHx (Fig. S3b). Based on the lack of change in transmission (indicating the absence of an increase in H2 in the solution) in the presence of benzaldehyde, a negligible fraction of the reduction current for benzaldehyde ECH was directed towards H2 evolution (Fig. S3b), consistent with the high Faradaic efficiency of Pd for ECH of benzaldehyde (Table 1). The absence of the β-PdHx in XANES in the presence of benzaldehyde is qualitatively similar to the cyclic voltammetry study of Pd foil described in the SI, where the amount of Pd hydride formed (based on charge) during a negative sweep is inhibited more by benzaldehyde than by phenol at the same solution-phase concentrations (Fig. S4). Under these conditions, the reduction current induces the reversible formation of α-Pd hydride, indicating negligible current related to reaction with benzaldehyde or phenol. As discussed in more detail in the SI and below, these data show that benzaldehyde binds more strongly to Pd than does phenol (and has a higher coverage under reaction conditions), and so the corresponding coverage of H* on Pd during hydrogenation catalysis is lower for benzaldehyde than phenol. The β-PdHx forms after the surface is populated with a higher concentration of adsorbed H [28], and, for α-PdHx, the concentration of H in the bulk scales with steady state coverage of adsorbed hydrogen [29,30]. The absence of β-PdHx in the presence of benzaldehyde implies less available surface hydrogen (lower hydrogen coverage). This lower hydrogen coverage may be due to strong adsorption of benzaldehyde on the surface (blocking sites for hydrogen adsorption) and/or high reactivity of benzaldehyde (which would consume surface hydrogen rapidly, forcing a low steady-state coverage of hydrogen). EXAFS spectra of Pd/C were acquired under constant potentials where the β-PdHx forms (−0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and where α-PdHx forms (−0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl). These spectra provided a basis for comparison to the same conditions in the presence of phenol or benzaldehyde. Typical Pd K-edge Im[χ] EXAFS spectra are shown in Fig. S5 for several conditions. Fitting of the experimental spectra to the theoretical standards (from FEFF9) yields the structural parameters reported in Table 3 . The Pd-Pd coordination number indicates the particle sizes are ~3 nm [31], small enough that Pd behaves differently than bulk in terms of chemical reactivity and hydride formation [23,28,32,33], but large enough that there are still distinct hydride phases, although with different [H]/[Pd] ratios (x) than in the bulk [24,34]. As recently reported [24], this is suggested to be due to the competing interactions of the core Pd that behaves similar to bulk Pd and the outer shell of Pd that becomes more significant at smaller particle sizes. The average 1st shell Pd-Pd distances in Table 3 confirm that at −0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the Pd-Pd distances are substantially larger than that of the bulk foil and, therefore, correspond to the presence of H dissolved in the Pd phase, consistent with β-PdHx [24,28,35]. At −0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the Pd-Pd distances are shorter, but still larger than for the bulk foil, indicating that less H is dissolved under these conditions. The Pd-Pd distances in the presence of 20 mM phenol are similar to those measured in absence of phenol. The distances initially contract (possibly to those of the α-PdHx) in the presence of benzaldehyde at both −0.55 V and −0.6 V. However, the lattice expands with increasingly negative potentials, even in the presence of benzaldehyde, although not to the extent observed under mild reducing conditions in the absence of benzaldehyde until −1.2 V (at which the current is sufficiently high to completely convert the benzaldehyde being flowed past the catalyst, see SI). The average Pd-Pd distance change (fractional lattice expansion δ l / l 0 ) can be used to estimate the H/Pd atomic ratio for the H dissolved in the Pd bulk via [35]: (1) δ l l 0 = 0.0666 H P d - 0.0164 H P d 2 Although Eq. (1) was derived for bulk Pd above the critical point temperature, it can be used semi-quantitatively for Pd/C nanoparticles and for both α and β phases [28]. (The relationship between the Pd-Pd distance and [H]/[Pd] is discussed in greater detail in Ref. [24] and in the SI, Fig. S6.) Fig. 5 shows the [H]/[Pd] ratio of the Pd/C under different electrochemical conditions based on the 1st shell Pd-Pd distance expansion using Eq. (1). Here we assume that the Pd/C obeys the same equation as bulk Pd, and that the values of the foil constitutes the starting Pd-Pd distance (strictly, should be the Pd-Pd distance of a bare nanoparticle). Since the amount of hydrogen in the bulk is determined by the steady state hydrogen coverage on the surface [29], and scales linearly with it [30], [H]/[Pd] can act as an estimate of the relative hydrogen coverage. Fig. 5 shows this hydrogen coverage is much lower in the presence of benzaldehyde than in the presence of phenol. However, changing the potential from −0.6 to −1.2 V causes an increase in the bulk H concentration (and thus the surface concentration, proportionally), from 2.5% to ~20%. The increase in [H]/[Pd] from −0.6 V (0.027) to −0.9 V (0.10) mirrors the increase in rate for ECH of benzaldehyde on Pd over these same potentials (0.37 s−1 at −0.6 V to 1.08 s−1 at −0.9 V)[13] as shown in Fig. 1, and replotted in Fig. 5. A comparison of the reduction current during the EXAFS measurement to the [H]/[Pd] ratio also shows a similar correlation when benzaldehyde is present (Fig. S7). The inhibition of the β-PdHx in the presence of benzaldehyde detected by EXAFS corroborates the XANES data from Fig. 4 that the Pd/C catalyst has a low hydrogen coverage in the presence of benzaldehyde. This result has been observed both at steady state conditions (EXAFS), as well as under slowly decreasing potentials (XANES). This indicates that the high reactivity of Pd for benzaldehyde ECH is not due to the formation of a β-PdHx phase, differentiating it from reports of the β-PdHx being more active for CO2 reduction than Pd metal [26]. It is speculated, in contrast, that the high benzaldehyde activity is caused by metallic states of Pd in the presence of benzaldehyde, and the increase in ECH rate with more negative potential is caused by a higher hydrogen coverage. The EIS measurements summarized in the SI show that adsorbed phenol covers a large fraction of the Pt disk’s surface, and that benzaldehyde covers an even larger fraction, under their ECH reaction conditions studied there. The EIS results also confirm that the rate of ECH over the Pd disk is faster for benzaldehyde than phenol (consistent with our direct rate measurements over Pd/C above)."
14,Discussion,
15,Faradaic efficiency towards ECH and relation to hydrogen coverages,"4.1 Faradaic efficiency towards ECH and relation to hydrogen coverages We show next that the high Faradaic efficiency of Pd for ECH of benzaldehyde implies the adsorbed H (H*) coverage (θH) is low in the presence of benzaldehyde. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) current in the presence of benzaldehyde is ~1% of that without benzaldehyde (99% Faradaic efficiency towards ECH of benzaldehyde at comparable total currents to without benzaldehyde). Assuming HER current is proportional to θH 2 or θH, based on a Tafel or Heyrovsky mechanism [36], this implies θH on Pd must only be 1–10% of that in the absence of benzaldehyde (assuming in the absence of benzaldehyde that θH ~1). At pH 5, the exchange current density of Pd for HER is ~2–5 times lower than Rh or Pt (respectively), in the absence of organics [37], and yet the HER current at similar potentials in the presence of benzaldehyde is much lower for Pd than Pt or Rh (1% of that in HER for Pd, ~50% for Rh or Pt). Again, using the assumption that the HER current is proportional to θH or θH 2 under the same overvoltages, this indicates that Pd has a lower hydrogen coverage under benzaldehyde ECH conditions than either Pt or Rh. The XANES and EXAFS results also indicate the θH is much lower on Pd in the presence of benzaldehyde than in its absence or in the presence of phenol. This lower θH on Pd than Pt or Rh in the presence of benzaldehyde is either due to benzaldehyde consuming H* much faster on Pd than Pt or Rh, or benzaldehyde (or its products) blocking sites more efficiently on Pd (i.e., higher coverage) than on Pt or Rh, or both. The first explanation can be ruled out, since it is inconsistent with the similar TOF for these three metals (Table 1), which is only 50% higher for Pd than Pt or Rh. The second explanation is more viable, since it is also consistent with the fact that the reaction order in benzaldehyde is zero for Pd but one on Pt and Rh (see below). Based on the cyclic voltammetry with a Pd foil (Fig. S4), benzaldehyde greatly reduces the amount of α-hydride formed, even though the current due to benzaldehyde hydrogenation is very low (evidenced by the observed similarity in areas of the α hydride formation and removal peaks), at potentials above 0 V vs. RHE, also supporting the hypothesis of site-blocking. From the cyclic voltammograms, phenol binds more weakly to Pd than benzaldehyde does, based on the lower inhibition of the bulk Pd hydride formation by 20 mM phenol (~50% inhibited) than by 20 mM benzaldehyde (~75% inhibited) (Figure S4). Although the cyclic voltammogram can give a qualitative assessment of the relative binding strengths, it does not allow us to estimate coverages under reaction conditions at voltages more negative than 0 V vs. RHE. However, the double layer capacitance in the presence of organic molecules remains reduced at −0.1 V vs. RHE as observed by impedance spectroscopy (Fig. S8, Table S1). This suggests organic (benzaldehyde or phenol) adsorption remains competitive with that of H* on Pt under cathodic bias, based on the inversely proportional relationship between double layer capacitance and organic coverage on metals in aqueous solution [38]. For Pd, however, interpretation of adsorbate capacitance from impedance spectra is complicated by differences in bulk hydride formation."
16,Proposed Langmuir-Hinshelwood reaction model involving adsorbed surface hydrogen (H*) addition,"4.2 Proposed Langmuir-Hinshelwood reaction model involving adsorbed surface hydrogen (H*) addition As noted above, we will use the same reaction model involving the addition of an adsorbed H to the adsorbed organic in the rate-determining step to explain all the data for all three metals and both organics. The fact that the Pd has the “α-hydride” present during benzaldehyde hydrogenation does not change its surface from being essentially pure metallic Pd, but this is not true during phenol hydrogenation, where the Pd converts to the β-hydride. So we expect qualitatively similar behavior for all three Pt group metals (except during phenol hydrogenation over Pd). However, there will be quantitative differences between the metals in the adsorption equilibrium constants for both the organic and hydrogen as well as in the rate constant for the rate-determining H-addition step. This explains the general similarities but also differences between systems in Fig. 1 [9,10]. For a kinetic model based on this simple mechanism to capture the observed kinetic and spectroscopic data, it must explain the observed behavior near room temperature, as summarized here for the conditions of Figs. 1 and 2 and Tables 1 and 2: 1. The TOFs of phenol in both TCH and ECH are much slower on Pd than Pt or Rh, and much slower than the TCH and ECH TOFs of benzaldehyde on all three metals. Otherwise, the TOFs for all three metals in both TCH and ECH of both phenol and benzaldehyde are all within a factor of about 4. This is tentatively attributed to the fact that Pd has converted to the β-hydride in phenol hydrogenation conditions, so it is really a quite different material than all the other cases. 2. The rates of TCH and ECH of both phenol and benzaldehyde increase with increasing chemical or electrochemical driving force to make H* (i.e., H2 pressure or applied voltage, respectively), on all three metals. 3. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopies show that the H coverage on Pd is very low during benzaldehyde ECH but much higher during phenol ECH (indeed so high that the Pd converts to the β-hydride). 4. The Faradaic efficiencies for ECH of both phenol and benzaldehyde are in the range 40–70% for both Pt and Rh, but it drops to <1% for phenol on Pd and rises to ~99% for benzaldehyde on Pd. 5. The apparent activation energies are lower in ECH than for TCH, especially with benzaldehyde. 6. The rates of TCH and ECH of both phenol and benzaldehyde show reaction orders in organic concentration near 20 mM that vary from system to system (Table 2). 7. When the phenol concentration was varied over a much broader range, the TCH rates over both Pd and Pt were found to approach first-order in phenol concentration at low concentrations (<20 mM), be approximately zero order in phenol at 100 mM phenol, then approach an order of −1 at high phenol concentrations (>250 mM). We explain these results based on a simplified 3-step microkinetic model for phenol and benzaldehyde hydrogenation (both ECH and TCH) which assumes a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism wherein the two reactants adsorb competitively and then react: (2) A + ∗ ⇌ A ∗ ( K A ) (3) H + ∗ ⇌ H ∗ ( K H ) (4) A ∗ + H ∗ → P r o d u c t ( k L H , c ) Here, A represents the reacting aqueous-phase organic (phenol or benzaldehyde), H represents hydrogen (either H+ aq/e- (in ECH) or ½ H2,aq (in TCH)), * represents an open site, A* represents the adsorbed organic (in whatever form is required for the rate-determining step) and H* represents an adsorbed H atom. The rate-determining step is assumed to be H* addition to the adsorbed organic from the adsorbed hydrogen atom. We have assumed that the hydrogenation steps after this are fast. (Benzaldehyde has two H additions total, and phenol has four to form cyclohexanone, and two additional steps to form cyclohexanol). From this mechanism (see Supporting Information and Ref. [39] for derivation of rate equations), the rate (rLH,c for this Langmuir-Hinshelwood model with competitive adsorption) is of the form proposed for Fig. 2 [39]: (5) r LH , c = k LH , c K A C A K H C H 1 + K A C A + K H C H 2 where KA is the adsorption coefficient (equilibrium constant) of A on the surface, CA is the aqueous concentration of A (relative to the standard concentration of 1 M), and kLH,c is the rate constant for the surface hydrogenation (rate-determining) step. In ECH, CH is the concentration of H+ aq (divided by 1 M). In TCH, CH is equal to the “effective first-order concentration” of aqueous H2, ( P H 2 / ( 1 b a r ) )1/2. In both TCH and ECH, KH is defined as the H* coverage divided by this CH thus defined. The equilibrium constants and rate constant will depend on temperature and, for ECH, KH should increase exponentially with decreasing applied potential (i.e., approximately following the Nernst equation as described in the SI). We assume they are constant under the conditions where we quantitatively fit data to this rate equation (only TCH at 25 °C). This model assumes that there is no difference between different binding sites (*), although the adsorption constants may depend on the exposed surface facet. As noted above, the rate on Pt/C is dominated by the (1 1 1) facets. The effect of KHCH on the rate and the coverage of the organic (θA) and hydrogen (θH) is shown for several conditions in Fig. S9. The reaction model that best fits the data summarized above for both TCH and ECH of both phenol and benzaldehyde on Pd, Pt and Rh is the competitive adsorption model, where the organic is moderately strongly bound on the surface (KA is moderate, Fig. 6 , Fig. S9b). This reaction model is consistent with the one used in Fig. 2 where fitting shows KHCH is approximately 2.5 and KACA ranges from 0.175 to 22. The competitive adsorption Langmuir-Hinshelwood reaction model (Fig. 6) shows that for low KHCH and moderate KA , the reaction rate will increase with increasing KHCH (increasing overvoltage or increasing hydrogen pressure), but CA will not affect the rate (order in A is ~zero). Under these conditions, the coverage of A (θA) is relatively high (but does not completely saturate the surface), and the hydrogen coverage (θH) is low (but increases with increasing KHCH ). At sufficiently high KHCH , the rate becomes positive order in CA (and θA is low). In this regime, the rate begins to reach a maximum in KHCH , and the θH is high. (Fig. S9 shows that the concentration at which the rate reaches its maximum depends on the value of KA ). Fig. 6b shows that the CA also influences the coverages, changing the reaction order in A (discussed below as related to our experimental phenol TCH data in Fig. 2). The equilibrium constants KA for phenol adsorption determined by the fit to the rate data in Fig. 2 are very similar on Pd and Pt, i.e., 38 and 33, respectively. This value for Pt/C is very similar to the KA for phenol adsorption we determined by direct aqueous-phase adsorption measurements on Pt(1 1 1)-like sites (exp[−(−9 kJ mol−1)/RT] = 38) [16], but far below the value we determined for Pt steps sites or (1 1 0)/(1 0 0)-like sites (exp[−(−29 kJ mol−1)/RT] = 121000) [16]. This strongly supports the model presented and suggests that the hydrogenation occurs mainly on (1 1 1)-like sites. Also, the equilibrium constant KA for benzaldehyde adsorption we determined by direct aqueous-phase adsorption measurements on Pt(1 1 1)-like sites (exp[−(−27 kJ mol−1)/RT] = 54,100) [16] is much stronger than the KA for phenol on those same sites, consistent with the much lower reaction order for benzaldehyde on Pt/C in Table 2 (~0) than for phenol on Pt/C (~0.6). This again supports the kinetic model presented, and highlights the high importance of the Pt(1 1 1)-like sites compared to Pt steps and (1 1 0)/(1 0 0)-like facets for both phenol and benzaldehyde hydrogenation rates. It is also consistent with the observation that the rate of both phenol and benzaldehyde hydrogenation is slower on smaller Pt nanoparticles [22], which have a smaller fraction of (1 1 1)-like sites. The value of KHCH = 2.32 for Pt/C from the fit of Eq. (5) to Fig. 2b at CH = (1 bar)1/2 gives KH = 2.32 at 298 K, and a standard-state free energy of adsorption of H2 of approximately −2 kJ per mol H*. This value is close to the values estimated by Yang et al. [40] from modeling kinetic measurements of H2/D2 exchange in aqueous phase over Pt on silicalite of + 1.6 kJ per mol H* at 303 K (based on their reported value of KH = 0.28), and + 0.9 kJ per mol H* at 298 K (extrapolated using the standard enthalpy and entropy of adsorption they estimated based on KH values in the range from 303 to 343 K). Note that our fit value really reflects the H adsorption strength when phenol is also adsorbed (which may weaken H* binding), whereas the study by Yang et al. was in the absence of phenol. The hydrogen adsorption free energy (relative to 1 bar H2 gas) was shown from H underpotential deposition on a Pt(1 1 1) surface in aqueous solution by Gómez et al. [41] to change strongly with H* coverage, from −4.8 kJ/mol H* near full coverage at 0.05 V vs. RHE to −33 kJ/mol H* near zero coverage at 0.35 V vs. RHE, with values of −22, −17 and −11 kJ/mol H* at fractional H* coverages of 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6, respectively [41]. This trend would require that the value reported by Yang et al. [40] mentioned above correspond to H* coverages above 0.6 at the 30 bar H2 pressure used there, compared to a value ~0.5 reported by Yang et al. The differences between the measured (and calculated) thermodynamics of H* adsorption on Pt with and without water have been discussed previously [40,41]. The value we measure here is similar to the calculated standard free energy of adsorption on Pt(1 1 1) of H2 gas at 300 K from DFT (-9 kJ per mol H* at 0.25 monolayers and −3 kJ per mol H* at 1 monolayer coverage in the absence of water, i.e., in vacuum) [42], although other DFT-based calculations showed that the standard free energy of H* relative to H2 gas at 343 K increases by 44 kJ per mol H* with the addition of water to the Pt(1 1 1) surface [40]. The similar phenol concentration dependences in the rate of TCH for Pd and Pt in Fig. 2 implies that the phenol coverage is similar on Pd and Pt. Thus, phenol’s much slower TCH and ECH rates on Pd than Pt is not due to differences in its coverage or the strength of phenol adsorption. The strength and rate of H* adsorption is also not expected to be much different between Pd and Pt (and Rh), since they are very similar in vacuum, with Pd binding H slightly more strongly [43–45], and their HER rates are within an order of magnitude [37]. The low phenol hydrogenation rate on Pd thus seems to be due to the much lower value of kLH,c for phenol on Pd compared to Pt (or Rh). Calculations indicate that on Pd(1 1 1), phenol hydrogenation proceeds through hydrogenation of an adsorbed phenoxy intermediate, rather than a direct hydrogenation of adsorbed phenol as predicted for Pt(1 1 1) [15]. This, however, does not explain why the species that hydrogenates in the slowest step on Pt is so much slower to hydrogenate on Pd. The kLH,c for that same phenol-derived species must still be much slower on Pd than Pt. We tentatively attribute this to the fact that, under reaction conditions for phenol hydrogenation, Pd is actually a β-PdHx, as shown in Fig. 4, which could have a lower intrinsic activity for hydrogenation than metallic Pd. Interestingly, benzaldehyde hydrogenation follows the opposite trend: its ECH and TCH rates are slightly higher on Pd compared to Pt and Rh. With benzaldehyde, however, there is a difference in reaction order in the organic in ECH, now 1st order on Pt and Rh but still zero order on Pd. This implies lower benzaldehyde coverage on Pt and Rh compared to Pd in ECH, which may lead to lower rates than on Pd. In spite of this low benzaldehyde coverage on Pt and Rh, the benzaldehyde ECH rate is still ~3-fold faster than phenol’s ECH rate (where we know the phenol coverage is higher on Rh from its zero order, Table 2). Thus, the intrinsic rate constant (kLH,c ) for benzaldehyde is markedly higher than for phenol on Rh (and possibly Pt). Palladium also appears to have a higher intrinsic rate constant (kLH,c ) for benzaldehyde than phenol, since TCH and ECH rates on Pd are much higher for benzaldehyde than phenol. This is consistent with the reduced charge transfer resistance at −0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl observed from impedance spectroscopy for a Pd disk with benzaldehyde present compared to phenol (Fig. S8, Table S1). This is also consistent with the observation for ECH of acetophenone and benzophenone on Pd nanoparticles that the ketone group is more readily hydrogenated than the aromatic alcohol [46]. It must be easier for H* to insert into the aldehyde group on the adsorbed benzaldehyde than into the aromatic ring of the adsorbed phenol. Within the mechanism presented, higher hydrogenation rate constants for benzaldehyde than for phenol can lead to lower coverage of the former, possibly explaining both the lower coverage and the higher order for benzaldehyde than for phenol on Pt and Rh. However, the simple kinetic model (Eq. (5)) assumes that the organic reactant coverages are determined only by their competitive adsorption/desorption equilibria, and not significantly affected by their removal rates by the reaction. Within Eq. (5), the lower benzaldehyde coverage and consequently its higher order compared to phenol can only result from a lower adsorption constant KA of benzaldehyde than of phenol. The reaction model with moderate KA matches the behavior of Pd ECH and TCH of benzaldehyde (Table 2). The hydrogen coverage (θH) is low, and there is no dependence of the rate on the concentration of benzaldehyde. However, as the KHCH increases (either by increasing hydrogen pressure for TCH or increasing electrochemical potential for ECH), the rate increases and θH also increases. The ECH and TCH of phenol over Rh, as well as TCH of benzaldehyde on all three metals also are in this same regime, where the reaction is zero-order in the organic reactant. For all of the systems in Table 2 for which the orders in [organic] was measured both for TCH and ECH, the orders were either the same, or more positive for ECH than TCH. This occurs because KHCH is higher in ECH than in TCH, due to the more negative applied potential in ECH (<0 V vs. RHE) than effectively present in TCH conditions (0 V vs. RHE open-circuit potential at 1 bar H2), leading to higher coverage of H on the surface. According to the rate law in our model (Eq. (5)), the higher KHCH is, the higher CA (or KACA ) must be to achieve rollover in rate versus CA . This could be amplified by the fact that KA generally decreases with H* coverage for many organics on platinum group metals, which is not explicitly incorporated in our model in Eq. (5) [47–50]. By our reaction model (Fig. 6a), under conditions where the reaction is positive order in A, the rate would increase less with an increase in KHCH (compared to conditions that are zero-order in A). This difference is observed for ECH of benzaldehyde between Pt/Rh (first order in benzaldehyde) and Pd (zero order in benzaldehyde), where the rate of benzaldehyde ECH over Pd is comparable to Pt at low overvoltages (−0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl), but double that of Pt at higher overvoltages, or higher KHCH (-0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl), as shown in Fig. 1d. This shows that Pd’s rate has a stronger dependence on KHCH than Pt or Rh under benzaldehyde ECH conditions. Although Pd under benzaldehyde ECH conditions operates at the same CH (pH and applied potential) as Pt and Rh, θH is lower on Pd, either due to the fact that H* is removed faster by the faster reaction with benzaldehyde or due to a weaker KH , or larger KA , for Pd than Pt and Rh. As we discuss above, according to Eq. (5) only different KA values could cause these changes in coverage, as the KH vales should be quite similar for these metals. Because of the lower θH (and corresponding higher θA) on Pd compared to Pt and Rh, there is a zero-order dependence on [A] (benzaldehyde) for Pd, but first-order for Pt and Rh. Solution calorimetry also supports stronger benzaldehyde adsorption (larger KA ) on Pd than on Pt or Rh [13]. The positive order in phenol for TCH at low phenol concentrations and negative order in phenol at high concentrations (Fig. 2) can also be matched by the same reaction model of Fig. 6b. At moderate KA , as CA is increased (in this case A refers to phenol), the rate goes through a maximum, where the order in A transitions from first order to negative order (Fig. 6b). During the transition, the hydrogen coverage will begin to decrease, but will not approach zero until very high concentrations of CA . As we discuss above, the presence of 20 mM phenol does not decrease the HER current on Pd (compared to Pd without any organic), consistent with the observation that at 20 mM phenol, the phenol concentration is too low to significantly reduce the hydrogen coverage on Pd (HER activity being related to the hydrogen coverage)."
17,Activation energy differences,"4.3 Activation energy differences The 7 kJ mol−1 lower apparent activation energy for benzaldehyde in ECH compared to TCH on all catalysts (Table 2) may be understood within this same kinetic model and Eq. (5). We show next that this can be expected due to the increase in H coverage brought on by the higher H chemical potential (i.e. driving force to make H*) in ECH than in TCH. Under conditions where K A C A ≫ 1 + K H C H (corresponding to very high organic coverage and low hydrogen coverage), Eq. (5) simplifies to: (6) r LH , c ≈ k LH , c K H C H K A C A The observed apparent activation barrier for these conditions would then be E app = E a , L H , c + Δ H H - Δ H A , where k LH , c = A LH , c e x p E a , L H , c RT , and Δ H i is the standard enthalpy of adsorption of species i, always a negative value. If Δ H A is larger in magnitude than Δ H H , this could result in an apparent activation energy higher than the true activation barrier for the LH step. In contrast, if KHCH was much higher, such that K H C H ≫ 1 + K A C A (corresponding to very high hydrogen coverage and low organic coverage), Eq. (5) simplifies to: (7) r LH , c ≈ k LH , c K A C A K H C H In this case, the apparent activation barrier would be artificially lower than the true activation barrier instead of higher. Even though the data in Tables 1 and 2 were measured at conditions where the coverages do not approach the limiting values required to get Eqs. (6) and (7), the qualitative difference between Eqs. (6) versus (7) is still to be expected. Thus, the lower apparent activation energy observed for ECH of benzaldehyde than TCH in Table 2 is expected due to the higher KHCH at the negative applied potentials used in ECH. (We note again here that we use KHCH to generalize to both TCH and ECH, and ignore the role of applied potential beyond its influence on KH discussed in the SI, which is mainly associated with the Nernst Equation.) Additional effects related to the observations that higher H coverages weaken organic adsorption may also play a role here [47–49]. Under limited conditions, the rate law in Eq. (5) may be approximated with a power-law type expression which explicitly includes the reaction orders in reactant concentrations, α and β : (8) r LH , c = k LH , c K A C A K H C H 1 + K A C A + K H C H 2 ≈ k LH , c K A C A α K H C H β The far right-hand side of this equation is an approximation that will only have constant values of α and β under small ranges of concentrations. For example, this form matches Eq. (6) when α = - 1 a n d β = 1 , and matches Eq. (7) when α = 1 a n d β = - 1 . If we consider the observed reaction orders for benzaldehyde TCH and ECH on Pt and Rh (Table 2), we see that for TCH (where the reaction order in benzaldehyde, α , is zero): (9) r LH , c ≈ k LH , c K A C A 0 K H C H β TCH where E app , T C H = E a , L H , c + β TCH Δ H H , and β TCH > 0 , Δ H H < 0 . For ECH, where there is a reaction order in benzaldehyde of one for Pt and Rh: (10) r LH , c ≈ k LH , c K A C A α ECH K H C H β ECH where now E app , E C H = E a , L H , c + β ECH Δ H H + α ECH Δ H A , β ECH > 0 , Δ H H < 0 , α ECH ≈ 1 , a n d Δ H A < 0 . Subtracting the above equations for E app gives: (11) E app , T C H - E app , E C H = β TCH - β ECH ) Δ H H - α ECH Δ H A For the molecules and metals studied here, it appears that β is close to unity for both TCH and ECH at the conditions of Tables 1 and 2, so that the first term on the right approaches zero. In this case, E app , T C H - E app , E C H > 0 (remembering that Δ H A is negative), or equivalently, E app , T C H > E app , E C H , thus, explaining the lower apparent barrier for ECH than TCH seen for any given molecule on any given metal seen in Table 2. The earlier proposal [17] of an Eley-Rideal mechanism for ECH of benzaldehyde on Pd was based on absence of a negative reaction order with respect to benzaldehyde concentrations at the concentrations studied. However, the range of benzaldehyde concentrations studied was small (15–25 mM) and as Figs. 2 and 6 show, the rate can remain relatively constant over such a small range of concentrations. Future work to definitively prove the mechanism for aqueous-phase benzaldehyde ECH on Pd is still needed, but the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism we propose in this work can describe the kinetic data under the concentrations tested. Our results show that Pt(1 1 1)-like sites are more active than Pt step and (1 1 0)/(1 0 0)-like sites in both phenol and benzaldehyde hydrogenation. This conclusion is based both on the earlier observation that the rates per unit area are slower on smaller Pt nanoparticles [22], and our kinetic modelling of concentration effects on rates here, which require adsorption equilibrium constants appropriate for (1 1 1) sites of Pt to fit the measured rates. This is the opposite from the observation for electrochemical hydrogenation of acetone in aqueous solution, where the Pt(1 1 0) step sites are most active, and the (1 1 1) and (1 0 0) facets are inactive due to too weak adsorption of acetone [51,52]. We attribute this marked difference between hydrogenation of acetone versus aromatics (phenol and benzaldehyde) to the much stronger binding of the aromatic molecules to Pt(1 1 1) than acetone. Acetone has a desorption temperature of ~190 K from Pt(1 1 1) in UHV, which corresponds to an adsorption energy of only ~50 kJ/mol [53]. Aromatic molecules (phenol and benzene) have much higher heats of adsorption (200 to 140 kJ/mol, depending on the coverage) [54,55]. Using these values in our recent bond-additivity model for the effect of solvents of adsorption energies [56,57] indicates that it would be endothermic to adsorb aqueous acetone on Pt(1 1 1) in aqueous phase (due to the failure of acetone to compete effectively with liquid water for Pt sites), whereas aqueous phenol adsorption is downhill by 21 kJ/mol (see above). Thus, while the weaker binding (1 1 1) facets may be more active for hydrogenation of these very strongly binding aromatics because they do not get covered too completely by adsorbed organics (leaving sites needed for H* adsorption), these facets may bind acetone so weakly that the coverage of adsorbed acetone is far too low to give significant rates. This explanation is consistent with the type of Langmuir-Hinshelwood model we proposed above also being applicable to acetone hydrogenation. Indeed, that model offers an excellent explanation for the reversed facet dependence observed for acetone versus aromatic hydrogenation rates."
18,Conclusions,"The dependences of the reaction rates on reactant concentrations and temperature for all cases of both ECH and TCH for benzaldehyde and phenol on Pt/C, Pd/C and Rh/C in aqueous-phase can be described successfully by a Langmuir-Hinshelwood model where the rate-determining step is the addition of an adsorbed H from the surface to the molecularly-adsorbed organic molecule, which competes for sites with H. The rate changes from being nearly first-order in organic concentration to strongly negative order as the organic concentration increases, for phenol, due to this competitive adsorption with H*. Because of the much lower solubility of benzaldehyde in water, this same range in concentration cannot be spanned. For Pt/C, the adsorption equilibrium constants for the organic required to fit the rates with this model are consistent with independent measurements of those equilibrium constants on Pt(1 1 1)-like sites (but not other facets), suggesting these are the most active sites. The increase in ECH activity with more negative (cathodic) potential is attributed to the corresponding increase in surface hydrogen coverage. The apparent activation energy decreases in going from TCH to ECH conditions, attributed to the higher H* coverage which results from the applied potential in ECH. The high benzaldehyde adsorption constant on Pd (perhaps aided by its high intrinsic rate constant for benzaldehyde hydrogenation) causes the steady-state hydrogen coverage to be low, resulting in a high Faradaic efficiency towards benzaldehyde ECH over H2 evolution. Pt and Rh have lower Faradaic efficiencies, and also higher orders in benzaldehyde for ECH, than Pd due to the lower benzaldehyde coverages on Pt and Rh. The high reaction rate of Pd towards benzaldehyde is not due to formation of β-PdHx, which does not form under these conditions (unlike what has been found for CO2 reduction). Adsorbed benzaldehyde is more reactive with H* (i.e., has a higher intrinsic rate constant for H addition) than is adsorbed phenol on all three metals."
