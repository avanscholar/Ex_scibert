0,Introduction,"Nowadays, ethanol is one of the most common and abundant energy carriers, since it is accessible through renewable resources (biomass). It is utilized not only as a fuel additive but also as a fuel replacement, which reduces the dependence on fossil fuels. It can also be used as a storage of hydrogen. Plasma-assisted reforming already occupies a significant place among other well known methods for hydrogen production, such as partial oxidation, steam reforming, pyrolysis, autothermal, catalytic, etc. Although steam reforming of hydrocarbons is currently the dominant technology due to the high hydrogen yield, it requires expensive and polluting catalysts [1]. Plasma sources can conveniently substitute catalysts in the reforming process since they provide both energy and free radicals simultaneously. Moreover, plasma systems have the additional advantage that they can work with various hydrocarbons such as natural gas, methane, gasoline, heavy oils, alcohols, and bio-fuels [2,3]. When using steam as an additional plasma gas, highly reactive radicals as H, OH and O are created, thereby increasing the efficiency of the plasma reforming. Furthermore, as a clear advantage, extra hydrogen can be obtained by reforming of water. Steam reforming has been performed using different plasmas and hydrocarbons [4–11]. Hu et al. studied steam reforming of ethanol in dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma, showing that the hydrogen yield and ethanol conversion increase with the water/ethanol ratio [4]. A slightly higher hydrogen production yield from steam reforming of ethanol and methanol in nonequilibrium pulsed discharge have been reported by Kikuchi et al. [6] as compared to the yield obtained at the same conditions but with pure alcohols. Steam reforming of ethanol in dynamic plasma-liquid system and non-thermal plasma was performed in Refs. [7,8]. Pulsed gliding arc and corona discharges have been applied for reforming of different alcohols and E85 in Refs. [9,10]. An analysis of the reforming process in the case of an ethanol/water/air mixture used in a ‘tornado’-type electrical discharge is presented in Ref. [11]. Among all plasma sources employed for reforming of hydrocarbons [2–11], microwave driven plasmas feature high stability and reproducibility over a large domain of operational conditions [12,13]. Moreover, the high efficiency of the microwave power transfer to the plasma results in a high density of free radicals and in relatively high gas temperatures. The effectiveness of microwave plasmas was tested for: reforming of hexane using pure steam in Ref. [14]; gasification of polyethylene using steam/argon in Ref. [15]; coal and charcoal gasification using steam/air in Ref. [16]; and reforming of methane in the presence of a catalyst in Ref. [17]. Hydrogen generation from microwave plasma reforming at room temperature and low pressure of ethanol and ethanol-water mixture has been investigated by Yanguas-Gil et al. [18]. The main decomposition products found were H2, CO, CO2, solid carbon in the case of pure ethanol, while in the case of ethanol-water mixture solid carbon formation was restrained. It was concluded that, the atomic hydrogen is removed from ethanol, and eventually the C–C bond dissociated due to direct electron impact processes. The reaction scheme in the case of ethanol-water mixture is considered to be the same as that for pure ethanol by taking into account the excess of oxygen radicals and consequently oxidation reaction that prevents solid carbon formation takes place. In Ref. [19] the role of the total Ar flow rate on the products of ethanol decomposition in microwave plasma at atmospheric pressure has been studied. Carbon deposit has been observed to increase when of the total gas flow decreases (i.e. increase of the residence time). Recently, in addition to the extensive experimental work on plasma reforming, much effort has been made to model the underlying kinetic processes and to find out the main reaction pathways leading to formation of the hydrogen-rich gas stream. There are several models available in the literature [20–23] which describe the reaction mechanisms for hydrocarbon oxidation. The model developed by K. Hoyermann et al. [20], accounting for 96 chemical species and 569 reversible reactions, provides a general and consistent mechanism of hydrocarbon oxidation, although it is not validated for ethanol combustion. A comprehensive kinetic model developed by Marinov [21] studies ethanol combustion considering 56 species and 351 reversible reactions. This model is validated by experimental data obtained from laminar premixed flames, shock tubes and turbulent flow reactor. Kinetic models of ethanol oxidation are also presented by Saxena et al. [22] and by Dryer [23] and the theoretical predictions were validated by experimental results presented in Refs. [23–26]. Nevertheless, the upper temperature limit considered does not exceed 2050 K, thus limiting the applicability of these models for plasmas featuring higher gas temperatures. In a series of works, we have performed extensive experimental and theoretical investigations of microwave (2.45 GHz) plasma-assisted reforming of different alcohols [27–30]. High conversion efficiency in reforming of methanol and ethanol has been achieved using argon as a background carrier gas under laminar gas flow and atmospheric pressure conditions [27]. In order to improve the plasma source performance and to increase the hydrogen energetic mass yield, a ‘tornado’-type plasma with a high-speed tangential gas injection (swirl) at atmospheric pressure has been applied to decompose alcohol molecules, viz., methanol, ethanol and propanol, and to produce hydrogen-rich gas. The reforming efficiency has been experimentally investigated both in Ar and Ar + water vapor plasma environments. Average hydrogen yields as high as 98.2%, 98.4% and 95.8%, for methanol, ethanol and propanol, respectively, have been achieved [28]. So far, it has experimentally been found that a small addition of water increases the hydrogen production rate nearly by a factor of two. Detailed kinetic models describing the processes of methanol [29] and ethanol [30] reforming in pure argon plasmas have been developed and validated by the experimental results as obtained by mass and FT-IR spectroscopy. Naturally, the next essential step is a thorough analysis of the alcohol reforming into hydrogen rich gas stream in an argon-water vapor plasma environment. The present study is a continuation of the previous work on microwave argon plasma assisted ethanol reforming [30]. Here, a wave driven microwave ‘tornado’-type argon/water vapor plasma at atmospheric pressure conditions has been used for ethanol conversion into hydrogen-rich gas. The plasma effluent gas stream was analyzed by Mass Spectrometry (MS) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR). Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) has been applied to determine the main plasma parameters and radiative species created in the plasma. The previously developed model [30] has been updated and applied for calculation of the ethanol/water decomposition product densities and their variations along the plasma source as well as the hydrogen yield dependence on the ethanol and the water percentages in the background gas mixture."
1,Experimental setup,"The experimental setup (see Fig. 1 ) is the same as presented in Ref. [29]. A waveguide (WR-340) system (isolator, directional couplers, a 3-stub tuner, a moveable short-circuit) was coupled to a microwave generator (Sairem). A waveguide surfatron [31] serves as a field applicator within a quartz tube with length of 25 cm (1.5 cm inner and 1.8 cm outer diameters, respectively), where the background gas mixture flows. The discharge is ignited and maintained using a swirl system, described in Refs. [28–30], which creates ‘tornado’-type (or vortex) gas motion and allows for the stabilization of the torch. The total gas flow consists of the background gas argon (purity of 99.999%), ethanol and water vapor. A bubbling system was used to introduce ethanol and water vapors into the total gas flow Q tot. In order to boost the dragging of water molecules by the argon gas flow, the water tank was heated along with rigid control of the water temperature. The ethanol flow rate was calibrated by measuring the ethanol volume change vs. bubbling time [28–30]. Additionally, it has been calculated using the vapor pressure values at given temperatures according to the following expression: (1) Q E = Q Ar / E · P E P atm − P E where Q Ar/E is the argon flow used for ethanol bubbling, P E is the ethanol vapor pressure at ambient temperature and P atm is the atmospheric pressure. The two values for Q E coincide to within the experimental error. The water partial flow was calculated in the same way and kept at Q W = 4 sccm for all measurements. Furthermore, the argon-water vapor gas flow joins the main stream of pure argon Q Ar and the total flow entering the discharge tube is Q tot = Q Ar tot + Q E + Q W . The microwave power was supplied in continuous mode and was kept at 450 W. The total argon flow (Q Ar tot) at 1000 sccm, while changing the partial alcohol flows. The hydrogen production rate was obtained by calibrating the mass analyzer with pure hydrogen (99.999%). The effluent gas was analyzed by a Stanford Research System RGA 200 MS and a Termo Nicolet 5700 FT-IR in the wave number range 1000–4000 cm−1. For this purpose, a portion of the output gas from the plasma reactor was probed. The spectra emitted by the plasma have been analyzed by OES. The emitted light was collected with an optical fiber, placed perpendicularly to the quartz tube and directed to a Jobin-Yvon Spex 1250 spectrometer."
2,Experimental results,"The dynamic behavior of the hydrogen partial pressure when ethanol and water vapor are introduced into the Ar plasma is illustrated in Fig. 2 . As seen in this figure, a step-like increase of H2 partial pressure is observed when ethanol and water vapor are introduced. The first step is due to ethanol flow (Q tot = Q Ar tot + Q E ) and the second one is a result of the additional introduction of water vapor, i.e., the gas flow consists of ethanol and water vapor simultaneously (Q tot = Q Ar tot + Q E + Q W ). Note that the ethanol partial flow was varied in the range 2.7–15 sccm, while the water vapor flow was kept constant at ∼4 sccm. Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide were detected, although the tendency of the changes in the carbon dioxide signal in the MS spectra is not clear due to the small signal to noise ratio. The signals related with other species keep constant values in the “plasma on” and “plasma off” situations. Additional information about CO and CO2 has been obtained by FT-IR measurements. Typical FT-IR spectra of the outlet gas stream obtained with and without water vapor introduced are shown in Fig. 3 . The infrared absorption spectra clearly show a decrease of the CO peak (at 2170 cm−1) with addition of water vapor while simultaneously a CO2 peak (at 2349 cm−1) appears. This can be due to the water-gas shift reaction (R1) CO + H2O ↔ CO2 + H2 – 41.1 kJ The results of OES are very similar to those obtained for the Ar/ethanol plasma presented in Ref. [30]. The microwave power is absorbed mainly by the electrons, which then transfer this power to the gas via elastic collisions and excitation of rotational and vibrational molecular levels. Via collisions with the plasma gas molecules and atoms the energy of excited molecules is further distributed among other species. The emission of the radiative species in the visible spectral range from 3500 to 7500 Å from the argon/ethanol/steam plasma is shown in Fig. 4 . The presence of new molecular and atomic species such as CN (violet system, B2Σ → X2Σ), C2 (Swan system, between 4500 and 5700 Å, A3Πg → X′3Πu), the hydrogen Balmer-alpha line Hα (6563 Å) and several Ar lines indicates that the plasma decomposes the ethanol molecules. Also species emitting in the ultraviolet spectral range, which are not shown in the figure such as OH (A2Σ+, υ = 0 → X2Πi, υ′ = 0), NH (3360 Å system, A3Π → X3Σ−1) and C (2479 Å) were detected. The measured gas temperature profile along the plasma column at Q E = 2.72 sccm and Q W = 4 sccm is nearly flat, in the range 3000–3150 K. At the end of the discharge zone the temperature drops to 1600 K. This was estimated from the emission spectra of OH band using Boltzmann plot method under assumption that the rotational temperature is equal to the gas temperature at atmospheric pressure conditions [30]. Additionally, the electron density as an important plasma parameter has been estimated using the Stark broadened Balmer-alpha line Hα spectral line profile. An example of measured line, fitted by a Voigt profile with a squared correlation coefficient of R 2 = 0.9998 is given in Fig. 5 . Detailed description of the deconvolution procedure to determine the full width at half-maximum of the Gaussian (ΔλG) and Lorentzian (ΔλL) components can be found in Ref. [30]. The calculated electron density is in the range of 4.7 × 1014 cm−3 – 8.3 × 1014 cm−3 for ethanol flow rates Q E varying from 2.72 to 8.16 sccm, steam flow Q W = 4 sccm, total gas flow Q Ar tot = 1000 sccm, and microwave power P = 450 W. These densities correspond to the axial part of the discharge, from where most of the detected radiation is emitted."
3,Theoretical model,"To clarify the main mechanisms behind the decomposition of ethanol in the argon/steam microwave plasma environment the theoretical model developed in Refs. [29,30] has been updated and used. The model describes ethanol decomposition in argon plasma and includes a set of non-linearly coupled, spatially dependent differential equations describing plasma thermodynamics, gas heating and flow, as well as chemical kinetics. The chemical kinetics is based on that developed by Marinov [21]. The formation of solid carbon in the outlet gas stream as well as of carbon black on the walls has been accounted for by introducing 20 additional reactions [32,33] and considering new components such as C2 and gas phase carbon C. The rate constants of the chemical reactions were extrapolated to the required temperature range (to 3500 K) using a non-linear extrapolation method [34]. The reliability of the extrapolated rate constants have been tested as described in Ref. [30]. The thermodynamic data of the processes were taken from available thermodynamic databases [34–39]. The algorithm used for the calculations is similar to that of the well-known computer code Reaction Design, CHEMKIN [37]. In the present model only axial variations are considered and local thermal equilibrium is assumed. Under these assumptions the gas thermal balance equation becomes [30] (2) c p p 0 V 0 k B T 0 ⅆ T a ⅆ z = − 4 χ ( T ) R 2 ( T a − T w ) + δ S ⅆ P ⅆ z , where V 0 is the gas velocity, T 0 is the initial gas temperature, p 0 is the gas pressure, k B is the Boltzmann's constant, c p is the heat capacity at constant pressure, δ is the fraction of the absorbed wave power which is transferred to thermal energy of the gas, S is the plasma cross-section and P is the absorbed microwave power. For simplicity parabolic radial temperature profile as in Ref. [30] was assumed. Here T a is the temperature at the axis. Linear dissipation of the microwave power along the plasma column length (up to 3 cm distance from the launcher, i.e. visible plasma column length outside of the launcher) has been assumed. The value of δ ≈ 0.9 , which is a typical one for atmospheric pressure conditions is adopted. The wall temperature axial profile T w (z) was experimentally determined and fitted by an analytical expression: T w (z) ≈ 605 + 2.74 × z−12.72 × z 2 + 1.05 × z 3, for z < 6 cm, where the axial distance z (in cm) is measured from the launcher. The measured temperatures vary in the range of 450–600 K. In the absence of water vapor in the argon plasma environment, as it has already been examined in Refs. [30], the ethanol reforming is described by the following global reaction mechanism (R2) C2H5OH → CO + 3H2 + C + 71.8 kJ Gas phase carbon atoms diffuse from the hot plasma region near the axis towards the colder tube wall, where a black deposit is formed [30]. Steam reforming takes place when water vapor is added to the argon/ethanol gas flow. Depending on the relative amount of water vapor in the background gas mixture, steam reforming can proceed via the following global reaction mechanisms: (R3) C2H5OH + H2O → 2CO + 4H2 + 255.8 kJ, (R4) C2H5OH + 3H2O → 2CO2 + 6H2 + 175.5 kJ Moreover, water vapor can react with free carbon atoms, leading to additional hydrogen production as described by the following global reaction mechanism: (R5) C + H2O → H2 + CO + 131.3 kJ Clearly, the dominant mechanisms of hydrogen formation will strongly depend on the relative amounts of introduced water and ethanol vapors. Therefore, we define a coefficient α as the ratio between the water flow introduced into the discharge, Q w, and the amount of water flow necessary to perform the global reaction (R3), Q w th . , i.e., (3) α = Q w Q w th . . It can be seen from Reaction (R3) that Q w th . is actually equal to the ethanol flow Q E . If α = 1, the total amount of introduced water could be converted into H2 according to the Reaction (R3). It should be noted that the obtained experimental results (see below) correspond to values of α in the range from 0.27 to 1.47. Therefore, the calculations are performed for two extreme cases, i.e., α > 1 and α < 1. The calculated equilibrium values of the stable substances such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water, and some intermediate complexes vs. temperature are shown in Fig. 6 (a, b) for these two extreme situations. These results are obtained considering the formation of solid carbon in the plasma source, i.e., accounting for heterogeneous (gas + solid carbon) conditions. The formation of solid carbon is a result of gas phase carbon diffusion towards the colder wall zone and further crystallization. The diffusion rate coefficient of carbon was estimated to be [30] (4) k est = 24 × ( T 273 ) 3 / 2 . The equilibrium concentrations of species vs. temperature for α = 0.37 is shown in Fig. 6(a). The results show that the decomposition of water into radicals OH and H take place independently of ethanol decomposition into H2, CO and C. Subsequently, OH radicals react with C producing CO. However, due to the OH (i.e. water) deficit, solid carbon is formed. The global reaction mechanism is then (R6) C2H5OH + αH2O → (1 + α) CO + (3 + α) H2 + (1 − α) C, with α < 1. According to the sensitivity analysis for H2 and C(solid) concentration in the afterglow plasma region, the most important reactions for ethanol/argon/steam is basically the same as in Ref. [30] obtained for ethanol/argon background gas mixture. The equilibrium concentrations of different species vs. temperature for α = 1.47 is shown in Fig. 6(b). Three temperature regions can be distinguished, depending on the formed stable substances and intermediate complexes. In the temperature range up to approximately 1000–1500 K methane and solid carbon are observed; the second region is characterized by formation of CO due to the reaction of C and water, in the temperature range from 1500 to 3500 K. Finally, in the third region, for temperatures above 3500 K, a complete decomposition of the mixture into the final products, as carbon in gas phase and atomic hydrogen takes place. Therefore, the obtained results in the case of α > 1 can be described by the global mechanism: (R7) C2H5OH + αH2O → 2CO + 4H2 + (α − 1) H2O. When comparing the results for α < 1 and α > 1, it is clear that the overall amount of carbon is significantly reduced with water excess. Relative increase of water flow will contribute to the decrease of the solid carbon, which corresponds to the global reaction mechanism (R5). Furthermore, the water deficit also reduces the relative concentration of CO2. An integral reaction scheme of the ethanol and water decomposition in argon environment is proposed in Fig. 7 . The integral scheme is based on analysis of modeling results and the rate coefficients' analysis, as well as on experimental findings. The two parallel channels of ethanol decomposition, i.e., the break of C–C bonds and formation of CH2OH and CH3 radicals and the detachment of the OH group lead to production of H2, CO and C [30]. In the first channel, where C–C bond is broken, CH2OH is decomposed through reactions with radicals such as H and OH into the complexes CH2O and HCO and finally into CO and H. In the second channel, after the detachment of OH group, CC bond is formed in C2H5 and C2H4 functional groups. Further, the reactions involving C2H5 and H or OH radicals contribute to the formation of stable species such as C2H4. The reaction of C2H4 with H, H2 and CH3 radicals results in the formation of a CC triple bond in acetylene, which can be decomposed into atomic C and H only at high temperatures (above 4000 K). The carbon is gradually removed from the plasma by diffusion (α < 1) [30]. Presence of complex radicals as CH3 and C2H2, during ethanol decomposition is due to the thermal plasma conversion of methane to acetylene. Decomposition of water H2O → H + OH takes place independently, with a bimolecular reaction constant [40] k = 2.66 × 10−7 exp (−57491/T) cm3/(molecules × s). Finally, OH radicals react with C producing CO and CO2. If the global mechanism of ethanol and water, i.e., Reaction (R4), takes place, CO2 and H2 should be the final products, since the process is exothermic. However, apparently the ethanol/water mixture is decomposed into H2 and CO (Reaction (R3)), followed by the endothermic water gas–shift reaction (R1). The axial distribution of the ethanol/water decomposition products along with the corresponding gas temperature profile is shown in Fig. 8 . The non-equilibrium calculations have been performed for the case of water excess (α = 1.47). It can be seen, that the tendencies are the same as for the equilibrium conditions (Fig. 6(b)), i.e., the main components H2, CO, and the excesses water together with some intermediate complexes are the final products formed. The ethanol decomposition starts at temperatures of about 1000–1500 K as seen in Fig. 8. Acetylene molecules are destroyed by the active radicals H and OH. At the highest temperature measured in the plasma (∼3500 K) the components formed are H2, H, CO, O, OH, H2O and CO2. Moreover, the results show that solid carbon does not form in the presence of water excess because the rate of solid carbon formation is less than that of the homogeneous chemical reactions considered [30]. The loss of carbon deposit with adding of water observed in Ref. [18] was attributed to the electron impact influence without taking into account the contribution of the complex radical kinetics. In the present case under atmospheric pressure conditions, solid carbon removal is a consequence of reactions with free radicals, mainly with OH radical. This results in formation of CO. On the other hand, noticeable role of Ar metastables in the overall reforming process was not detected."
4,Discussion,"Both, the experimental and theoretical results, demonstrate that hydrogen formation in argon plasma environment depends on the relative percentage of water and ethanol flows. Different formation regimes can be established, depending on the parameter α. For α = 0 (i.e. no water), the global reaction scheme can be described by Reaction (R2), in which three hydrogen molecules are formed per each ethanol molecule and solid carbon is formed on the tube walls [30]. If α = 1 or α = 3, the corresponding global reaction schemes are Reaction (R3) or Reaction (R4), according to which 4 or 6 hydrogen molecules are formed per each ethanol and water molecule. In these cases solid carbon is not formed. If α < 1, all of the water will contribute to hydrogen formation by the mechanism (R3), while the excess ethanol will be decomposed according to the scheme (R2), gaining H2, CO and C. The global mechanism is described by Reaction (R6), implying that a fraction of carbon atoms will be deposited on the walls. Finally, if α > 1 the hydrogen production rate will be the same as for α = 1 (i.e., 4 hydrogen molecules per one ethanol and one water molecule) and excess water will not be converted (cf. Reaction (R7)). Fig. 9 shows the hydrogen production rate vs. the ethanol flow rate for different production regimes, together with experimental results obtained with and without water in the background gas mixture. It can be seen that for α = 0 the experimental results [30] perfectly follow the theoretical curve. In order to enlighten the discussion, the values of ethanol flows and the difference in hydrogen flow rates obtained with and without water in the gas mixture are presented in Table 1 as well as the corresponding values of α. As it can be seen from Fig. 9 and Table 1, the experimental points for ethanol flow rates in the range Q E = 2–4 sccm (Q W = 4 sccm) correspond to conditions α > 1. Indeed, the flow rate in this case follows the dependence corresponding to α = 1 (i.e., Reaction (R3)). Moreover, deposition of carbon on the tube wall was not observed for these measurements, which further supports this scheme. Other experimental points correspond to α < 1, i.e., the reaction scheme (R6). We stress that carbon has been deposited on the tube wall for α < 1, as predicted by this reaction scheme. It can be shown that, in the special case of constant water flow, the dependence of the hydrogen production rate vs. the ethanol flow rate is linear (see dashed and blue lines on Fig. 9) with the slope equal to that of α = 0 (red line). The distance between the two lines along the y-axis equals the water flow rate because a single H2 molecule is formed per each H2O molecule. This dependence for Q w = 4.5 sccm is shown in Fig 7 as a blue line. As seen, the experimental points for α < 1 follow the blue line very well, further justifying the correctness of the above considerations."
5,Conclusions,"An experimental and theoretical investigation of steam reforming of ethanol in a microwave ‘tornado’ type argon plasma operating at 2.45 GHz and atmospheric pressure has been performed. The main conclusions of this research can be summarized as follows: • The hydrogen production rate depends on the ethanol/steam ratio and several production regimes can be identified; • The steam reforming of ethanol takes place and the ethanol/water mixture is decomposed into H2, CO and CO2 according to the Reaction (R3) C2H5OH + H2O → 2CO + 4H2 + 255.8 kJ, followed by the endothermic water gas–shift reaction (R1) CO + H2O ↔ CO2 + H2 – 41.1 kJ; • In the case of excess water, i.e., α ≥ 1, H2 and CO are the main decomposition components observed; • In the case of water deficit, i.e., α < 1, carbon deposit is additionally formed on the tube walls. • For α = 1, four hydrogen molecules are formed per one ethanol and one water molecule. This production rate does not increase with further increase of water up to α = 1.47."
