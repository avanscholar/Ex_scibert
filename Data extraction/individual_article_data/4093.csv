0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic technology based on the utilization of solar energy has been regarded as an ideal solution to eco-environmental problems and energy crisis [1–7]. As we know, hydrogen is considered as the most reliable and promising alternative energy source for its zero-emission of pollutants, renewability, and high-energy capacity [8–11]. Since Fujishima and Honda first reported photocatalytic water splitting reaction by using TiO2 electrodes in 1972, it has been widely concerned that photocatalytic water splitting over semiconductors for hydrogen production could provide a feasible approach to converting solar energy into H2 fuel [12–15]. And various semiconductor photocatalysts have been explored and applied in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for further enhancing hydrogen production and reducing cost from then on. In the photocatalysis field, titanium oxide (TiO2) has still been regarded as the most promising and efficient semiconductor because of its strong oxidizing power, greater photocatalysis activity, resistibility to photo and chemical corrosion, earth-abundant, and nontoxicity [16–20]. Resulting from its wide bandgap (3.0–3.2 eV), however, TiO2 can only emit ultraviolet light (3–5% of the solar spectrum), which indicates poor efficiency and HER activity of TiO2 with sacrificial reagents [21–23]. And the further application of TiO2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is hindered by its low quantum yield and fast recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs [24–26]. Recently, commercial TiO2 (Degussa P25) were applied to enhance HER performance due to the coexistence of rutile (~20%) and anatase (~80%). More importantly, these heterophase junctions enhance photocatalytic activity by producing novel electronic states which inhibit the recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs and boost charge transfer. Unfortunately, it is relatively constrained by the promotion of HER performance. Furthermore, the following two approaches are regarded as the most promising ways in designing TiO2-based photocatalysts with high photocatalytic HER performance, one is the incorporation of narrow semiconductors, the other is by modifying with noble metal or noble-metal based co-catalysts. Recently, TiO2 combined with metal sulfides with a narrow bandgap, e.g. CdS, NiS, CoS2, WS2, MoS2 and Bi2S3, etc. [27–32], has been proven to be an effective way to expand its range of light absorption and boost the charge separation, which results in excellent HER activity. Among them, Bi2S3, a typical semiconductor with a layered structure, is selected as the promising candidate for the modification of TiO2 due to its high visible-light absorption, narrow band-gap, and appropriate conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) [33–36]. More importantly, the CB value of Bi2S3 is more negative than that of TiO2, thus the photo-generated electrons can be transferred from Bi2S3 to TiO2 easily under visible light irradiation. Moreover, the VB of TiO2 is lower than Bi2S3, the transmission path of the photogenerated hole is contrary to photo-generated electrons for this reason. Therefore, the effective separation of photoinduced e−-h+ in the TiO2–Bi2S3 system is feasible. Additionally, MoS2 has been regarded as an alternative to noble-metal-based co-catalysts due to its high stability, earth-abundant, environmental friendliness, and unique layered structure [37]. More importantly, MoS2 is a 2D layered material with a sandwich-like structure (S–Mo–S), which shows a strong affinity to H+ in solution, and the unsaturated S atoms of MoS2 is exposed to the edge and acted as active sites [38,39]. Moreover, MoS2 also possesses a similar Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (DGH) of metal Pt, which is demonstrated to serve as an ideal substitute of noble-metal-based cocatalysts toward the HER process [40,41]. Through the calculation of free energy density functional theory, Hinnemann et al. found that the sulfur atomic which is exposed to the edge of MoS2 strongly binds to H+ in solution, and the H+ bound can be reduced to hydrogen by electrons [42]. Notably, coupling with co-catalyst MoS2 can improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 observably. Many recent reports have confirmed MoS2/TiO2 composite which using MoS2 as a cocatalyst and electronic mediator, performing higher photocatalytic HER activity than pure TiO2 [43–47]. Inspired by these concerns, the ternary heterojunction Bi2S3/MoS2/P25 was constructed with high visible-light photocatalytic HER performance by hydrothermal and calcination methods. Here, we use modified P25 as a precursor, and systematically characterized with the help of XRD, XPS, SEM, and TEM, etc. The photocatalytic HER activities and charge transport mechanism of Bi2S3/MoS2/P25 photocatalysis are also studied in detail. Significantly, the photocatalytic HER activity is enhanced obviously due to the synergistic effects of the co-catalyst and heterojunction in the MoS2/P25/Bi2S3 system."

2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Chemicals are analytical reagents without further purification in our experiment. Titanium dioxide (P25), sodium molybdate dihydrate (Na2MoO4·2H2O), bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O), l-cysteine (C3H7NO2S), and propionic acid (C3H6O2) were bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Company. Titanium dioxide (P25) was also purchased from the company, the ratio of anatase and rutile is about 79:21 according to the production standard. Deionized water was used throughout this program."
3,Synthesis of the MoS2/P25/Bi2S3,"2.2 Synthesis of the MoS2/P25/Bi2S3 Bi2S3/MoS2/P25 nanocomposite was synthesized by using the one-step hydrothermal method. Firstly, 10 mmol P25 was dispersed in the beaker with a mixed solution containing 10 mL deionized water and 20 mL C3H6O2. Then, it would achieve a homogeneous aqueous solution via stirring. Next, added 0.1 mmol Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.1 mmol Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, and 0.4 mmol C3H7NO2S in turn. Especially, adding different amounts of the source (Mo, Bi, S) in the same proportion could obtain 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 mol% MPB. Additionally, the Bi to Mo ratio was 1: 1 in all samples. The samples with different mass ratios of Mo and Bi were named as MPB-1, MPB-3, MPB-5, MPB-7, and MPB-9, respectively. After stirring for some time, the homogeneous solution was transmitted into a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 24 h when cooling down to normal temperature, washed and centrifuged with deionized water and ethanol twice. Subsequently, the sediment was dried at 60 °C. Grounding into a powder, the final product was collected. It could synthesize pure MoS2 without sources of Bi and Ti, pure Bi2S3 could be done in the same manner. MoS2/P25/Bi2S3 nanocomposite diagram is shown in Fig. 1 ."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by Bruker-AXS which was equipped with Cu Kα radiation ( λ = 1.54056 Å ). The Raman measurements were made using 532 nm laser line on a DXR spectrometer, and experiments were made in backscattering geometry. The morphology features of catalysts were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7001F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100). For recording the optical property of catalysts, the samples were tested by UV–visible spectrophotometer from 200 nm to 800 nm (UV2550, Shimadzu, Japan), which was using BaSO4 as the reflectance standard. The electrochemical performance was tested by electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Instruments, CHI660D). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured on PHI ESCA-5000C electron spectrometer."
5,Photocatalytic activity measurement,"2.4 Photocatalytic activity measurement Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of catalysts were tested with a 300 W Xe lamp in the full spectrum. Typically, 0.25 g of samples were suspended in the methyl alcohol aqueous solution (10 vol%, 80 mL). Solution was stirred and sonicated appropriate minutes before light irradiation. The H2-generation were analyzed by gas chromatograph (GC-8A, Shimadzu Co., Japan) with 0.4 mL resultant gas in the glass flask every hour."
6,Results discussion,"The phase composition of Bi2S3/MoS2/P25 nanocomposites was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. 2 a described the XRD patterns of P25 and MPB-7 composites with different amounts of. Firstly, we can clearly see that intense diffraction peak of P25 at 2θ = 25.28° and 27.446°, which corresponding to (101) and (110) lattice plane (JCPDS No. 21–1272 & No. 21–1276) respectively [48,49]. That attributed to the co-existence of anatase and rutile type for P25. Next, we can find the characteristic diffraction peaks of MoS2 (JCPDS No. 37–1492) and Bi2S3 (JCPDS No. 84–0279) were in the other two curves [50,51]. There are several obvious diffraction peaks of MoS2/P25/Bi2S3 composites at 2θ = 13°, corresponding to the crystal plane (002) of MoS2, the peak at 25° is represented (111) of Bi2S3 and (101) of P25, the peak at 27° is related to (102) of Bi2S3 and (110) of P25. As the amounts of Bi2S3/MoS2 increased, the characteristic diffraction peaks of various substances gradually become apparent gradually (Fig. 2b). The morphologies of MPB-7 and pure P25 were characterized by SEM and TEM. It shows that P25 nanoparticles and Bi2S3 nanoparticles are attached to MoS2 nanosheets, with a certain size of about 100–200 nm (Fig. 3 c), the SEM images of Bi2S3 and Bi2S3/P25 were displayed in Fig. 3a–b. Fig. 3d is an elemental mapping image of MoS2/P25/Bi2S3. P25 is a 25 nm particle in Fig. 3g, TEM images of the other two pure phases are in Fig. 3e–f. Fig. 3i shows that MoS2 nanosheets covered Bi2S3 sized about 100 nm. We can know that the obvious interlinear spacing of 0.34 nm and 0.62 nm correspond to the (101) plane of P25 and (002) plane of MoS2 in Fig. 3i, respectively. To further understand the microscopic structure of MPB-7 composite, we used laser Raman spectroscopy for analysis, the result was shown in Fig. 4 a. There were characteristic peaks at 381 and 402 cm−1, related to in-plane vibration-mode E1 2g and out-of-plane vibration-mode A1g of MoS2, respectively. The weaker peaks during 200 cm−1 contained Ag and B1g modes of Bi2S3. The Raman spectra of pure P25 shown peaks at 142, 408, 515, and 640 cm−1 correspondings to Eg, B1g, A1g, and Eg mode of P25 respectively. Compared with other samples, the peaks of pure P25 were stronger than Bi2S3/P25, MoS2/P25, and MoS2/P25/Bi2S3 composite due to atomic interactions when the sample was synthesized. The XPS survey spectra of MPB-7 is shown in Fig. 4b, the signals belong to elements Ti, O, Bi and Mo can be seen. Fig. 4c–f described the high-resolution XPS spectra of Ti 2p, O 1s, Bi 4f and Mo3d. The main two pronounced peaks of Ti 2p at 458.3 eV 464.2 eV are matched with Ti 2p3/2, and Ti 2p1/2 (Fig. 4c). In Fig. 4d, the peaks at 228.7 and 231.7 eV related to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 signals of Mo4+, and the peak at 235.5 eV was identified as Mo6+ 3d3/2. There were some minor peaks at the 231.01 eV and 233.37 eV corresponding to Mo5+ 3d5/2 and Mo5+ 3d3/2. The O 1s XPS peaks could be fitted with two peaks at 529.6 and 530.8 eV corresponding to Ti–O and O–H bonds (Fig. 4e) [52]. The bonds on the surface have a certain relation to the hydrophilicity of the catalyst surface, which can improve the photocatalytic activity. The dominant peak of Bi 4f located at 159.3 and 164.6 eV can be instituted to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 of Bi3+, respectively (Fig. 4f). Among the main peaks of Bi 4f, there were two peaks of S 2p5/2 and S 2p5/2. According to evaluating the photocatalytic H2 activities of P25 and Bi2S3/MoS2/P25 composites with different amounts of Bi2S3/MoS2 under the full-spectrum light irradiation. There was almost no H2 production of pure P25. According to the curves in Fig. 5 a, Bi2S3/MoS2/P25 composite enhanced the hydrogen production obviously when we increased the proportion of Bi2S3/MoS2. Interestingly, H2 production has improved when the amount of Bi2S3/MoS2 ranges from 0 mol%, 1 mol%, 3 mol%, 5 mol%, 7 mol% to 9 mol%. Especially, the hydrogen production of the amount 7 mol% was 13.0 mmol which was higher than the others. However, hydrogen production declined gradually when the content exceeded 7 mol%. This result is in keeping with the phenomenon of the co-catalyst-modified photocatalytic system reported by other researchers previously. It has an appropriate amount of Bi2S3/MoS2 catalyst to improve hydrogen production. The hydrogen production could be reduced by the carrier recombination center if the amount of catalyst was excess. Afterward, MPB-7 was checked by repeating the experiment for 25 h in the same case for considering its stability. There was continuously H2 generating with a little degradation after cycling, indicating that MPB-7 has great stability. As time went by, the hydrogen production went down a little bit due to the loss of the catalysts (Fig. 5b). Furthermore, compared with other previous literature, MoS2/P25/Bi2S3 possesses higher hydrogen evolution activity as shown in Table 1 , which high performance is attributed to the synergistic effects of the co-catalyst and heterojunction for boosting the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. For further analyzing the reason for the high photocatalytic activity of Bi2S3/MoS2/P25 composite, photocurrent and electrochemical impedance experiments were carried out. As shown in Fig. 6 a, photocurrent intensity of 7% Bi2S3/MoS2/P25 composite was stronger than other samples due to the expeditious recombination of carriers induced by light. Besides, the addition of two sulfide compounds promoted the carrier transfer rate synergistically. Meanwhile, Fig. 6b shows that 7 mol% MoS2/P25/Bi2S3 composite had smaller EIS semicircles than the other samples including P25, MoS2/P25, and Bi2S3/P25. It indicates that the composite had lower charge transfer resistance and faster interfacial charge separation. According to the photoelectrochemical performances, it is clear that the MPB-7 composite enhanced the hydrogen evolution activity when we added the source of Mo and Bi. What's more, the recombination of electrons and holes could be observed effectively by PL. Fig. 7 a reveals PL spectra of sample MPB-7, pure P25, Bi2S3/P25, and MoS2/P25. It shows that the PL emission peak of MPB-7 is lower than pure P25. Compared with pure P25, MPB-7 composite has a little shift ascribing to the hybridization effect of Bi2S3, MoS2, and P25. Sample MPB-7 has higher separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers. It is mainly attributed to the Bi2S3 and MoS2 reduced the photogenerated carriers combining. Fig. 7b exhibited time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy for sample P25, Bi2S3/P25, MoS2/P25, and MPB-7. The average PL lifetime of MPB-7 (0.427 ns) is lower than other samples. It means the Bi2S3/MoS2/P25 heterojunction could lead to increasing the non-radiative decay from the electronic interaction between the counterpart, which also lead to a reduced lifetime. Electron spin resonance (ESR) was employed to detect the radicals on P25, MoS2/P25, Bi2S3/MoS2/P25 composites in comparison, as shown Fig. 8 d. And 2, 2, 6, 6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) as an ideal radical scavenger was chosen to identify photoinduced electrons, which ESR spectra possess three significant characteristic peaks with intensity of 1:1:1. Furthermore, the signal intensity of TEMPO-e- in P 25 exhibit a slight decrease within 12 min under visible light irradiation, while both TEMPO-e- signals of P25/MoS2 and Bi2S3/MoS2/P25 are dropped obviously at the same conditions. Furthermore, no obvious signal for MoS2/P25/Bi2S3 are observed after light on after 8 min, which indicated the efficiency of photoinduced charge separation was improved significantly, resulting the greatly enhanced photocatalytic H2 production with the introduction of MoS2 and Bi2S3. One of the evaluation criteria of photocatalytic performance is the absorption capacity of light. The responses to solar light of pure P25, Bi2S3/P25, MoS2/P25 and MPB-7 catalysts were analyzed by DRS, and the results are expressed in Fig. 9 a.Visibly, all of composites have such absorption tails (600–800 nm) due to the addition of MoS2 and Bi2S3, and the intensity of this absorption tail of (Bi2S3/MoS2/P25) ternary composite is higher than other materials such as MoS2/P25, Bi2S3/P25 and pure P25 (Fig. 9a). It may strengthen the absorption capacity of composites, and contribute to enhancing the photoactivity. Through the UV–vis absorption spectra, the band gap could be calculated by the following formula: ( α h ν ) 1 / n = A ( h ν − E g ) , and the results are shown in Fig. 9b. Obviously, 3.3 eV, 1.37 eV and 1.3 eV are the band gap values of pure P25, MoS2 and Bi2S3, respectively. Combine Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 9c) and formulas following E f b ( v s N H E , p H = 0 ) = E f b ( v s A g / A g C l ) + 0.059 × p H + E ( A g C l ) E C B M ( v s N H E ) = E f b ( v s N H E , p H = 0 ) − 0.3 , Conductive band (CB) values of P25, MoS2, and Bi2S3 can be calculated as −0.25 V, −0.1 V and −0.35 V, respectively. Considering bandgap and CB values, a schematic diagram of the photocatalytic mechanism is drawn in Fig. 10 . By graphing the results, the electrons get excited in all the material simultaneously and move from valence bond (VB) to conduction band (CB) while leaving the holes (h+) behind at VB after the light illumination. Photo-generated electrons can transport to that of MoS2 due to its lower CB level and then react with the adsorbed H+ ions at the edges of MoS2 to form H2. The holes could transfer from P25 to Bi2S3 through MoS2, while the corresponding accumulated and photogenerated holes on the VB of Bi2S3 can subsequently oxidize the electron donor. And the efficiency of photoinduced charge separation was improved with the introduction of Bi2S3 significantly. Additionally, the strong capacity for oxidation and reduction of Bi2S3 is also beneficial to boost photocatalytic hydrogen production."
7,Conclusion,"In summary, the novel ternary Bi2S3/MoS2/P25 heterojunction were fabricated by hydrothermal approach and calcination, where MoS2 nanosheets were located between Bi2S3 nanoparticles and P25 nanoparticles and simultaneously act as a noble-metal-free co-catalyst and electron mediator. Compared with commercial P25, Bi2S3/P25, and MoS2/P25, Bi2S3/MoS2/P25 heterojunction possesses higher photocatalytic activity. The optimum Bi2S3/MoS2/P25 composite achieved a high hydrogen evolution rate of 13.0 mmol/g, which was nearly 8.5 and 5.2 times as much as that of P25/Bi2S3 and MoS2/Bi2S3. Furthermore, the HER performance is promoted by the presence of MoS2 and Bi2S3 to enhance the light absorption ability and separation efficiency of photo-induced carriers, which provides a new insight for utilizing the synergistic effects of the co-catalyst and heterojunction to construct a ternary heterojunction for improving electrons transfer and light-harvesting ability."
