0,Introduction,"Coke oven gas (COG) is a valuable by-product in the coal carbonization of steel industry or other plants, which usually comprises H2 (55–60 vol%), CH4 (23–27 vol%), CO (5–8 vol%), CO2 (less than 2 vol%) and trace impurities (e.g., H2S) [1,2]. As a hydrogen-rich gas, the utilization of COG has been widely concerned in recent years, which plays an important role in energy-saving and emission reduction of the steel industry [3,4]. In general, COG can be used as fuel for heating or power generation in the steel plant, and excessive COG is even burnt off and directly emitted to air in some cases resulting in huge energy waste and serious environmental pollution [1,5,6]. To effectively utilize COG from both economic and environmental views, COG has been used as a feedstock to produce value-added products, including pure H2, methanol, syngas and CH4 [6,7]. Hydrogen, as an environmentally friendly energy carrier and ideal fuel, is mainly obtained from fossil fuels (e.g., natural gas and coal) [8]. However, due to fossil fuel consumption reduction goal and environmental degradation, finding an affordable and environmentally friendly method for hydrogen generation from secondary resources gets particularly significant. COG has been considered as an ideal secondary resource for low cost hydrogen production duo to the high concentration of H2 (55–60%) and methane (23–27 vol%) [9]. At present, the main methods for producing pure hydrogen from COG include pressure swing adsorption (PSA) [3,10,11], membrane separation [12,13] and catalytic partial oxidation/reforming followed by water gas shift reaction (WGSR) [4,14,15]. In geranial, pressure swing adsorption is a commercial technology to efficiently separate hydrogen with high purity from COG [10], but it shows low yield of H2 with high energy consumption. Membrane separation is an alternative technique to obtain high-purity hydrogen with less energy consumption and continuous operation, but it needs superb manufacturing techniques to prepare qualified membrane reactor for large scale application [3]. Since the conversion of methane is a key issue for efficient and comprehensive utilization of COG, partial oxidation of methane has been widely investigated as a potential route to H2 and syngas production due to high energy efficiency. However, the most important issue of implementing partial oxidation technology relates to its elevated cost for pure oxygen supply [5,16]. H2 and syngas production can also be generated through reforming reaction with water [17,18]. However, the reforming process can only produce H2-rich gas instead of pure H2, which requires WGSR to enrich H2 that results in additional energy supply for the complicated H2 purification [9,19]. More importantly, all the above technologies (PSA, membrane separation, partial oxidation, reforming and WGS) need to undergo complete desulfurization preconditioning prior to avoid the poison effect of impurities (e.g., H2S and tar) during the H2 purity and or CH4 conversion [3,20]. Chemical looping reforming (CLR) is a promising technology that can obtain pure H2 from carbonaceous fuels and water without additional separation process via oxygen carrier (an oxygen storage solid material) as a medium [21–24]. A typical CLR system involves two reactors, a fuel reactor for converting fuels and a steam reactor for water splitting to produce pure H2, with the oxygen carriers circulating between the two reactors [21,25,26]. When using methane as the fuel, methane is partially oxidized by the chosen oxygen carrier (OC) to CO and H2 in the fuel reactor, and then the reduced oxygen carriers can be re-oxidized by H2O to generate H2 at the steam reactor [27–30]. Taking CO as a fuel, CO will be oxidized to CO2 by oxygen carriers, and pure H2 can be obtained at the water splitting step [31]. In the case of H2-rich gases as fuel, the purity of H2 can be significantly improved after the chemical looping process [31,32]. Since the COG mainly contains H2, CH4 and CO, chemical looping is an ideal technology to produce pure H2 from GOC. In addition, chemical looping process shows high tolerance for sulfur spices because of the high resistance to sulfur poisoning of oxygen carriers, which may simplify the desulfurization pretreatment for converting COG. Wang et al. [25] claimed that no sulfur element was observed via the oxygen carrier during the chemical looping reforming of petroleum coke with high content of sulfur, indicating that the sulfur species cannot react with the OC to deactivate them. Cu-based and perovskite oxygen carriers were tested extensively in a 120 kWth chemical looping combustion (CLC) pilot plant using fuel with the presence of sulfur impurities. The results showed that sulfur components in fuel show no effect on the activity of oxygen carriers and the exhaust gas from the air reactor is not polluted by the sulfur components [33,34]. Forero et al. [35] also found that the presence of sulfur-hydrogen compound could not reduce the combustion efficiency even when working with a fuel containing 1300 ppm H2S for a CLC process over copper-based oxygen carriers. The above results suggest that the presence of sulfur species in fuels fails to show native effect on the activity and stability of OC, and the two-step chemical looping process make it possible to obtain pure H2 in steam reactor even using sulfur containing fuels. As for the chemical looping reforming of COG (see Fig. 1 ), it can be converted to H2-rich syngas with small amount of CO2 in fuel reactor, and the reduced oxygen carrier can be restored by H2O to produce pure H2 in the stream rector. The H2-rich syngas gas obtained from fuel reactor with additional CO is ideal for methanol generation, because the industrial CO hydrogenation to methanol process also needs suitable amount of CO2 in the feed gases. The pure H2 obtained from the steam reactor can be directly used for fuel cell due to the high purity. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that the chemical looping process may offer an efficient way to produce pure H2 from COG without additional separation steps. Oxygen carrier is one of the most important issues to perform this concept. In general, a high performance oxygen carrier requires high reactivity, high oxygen transport capacity, superior stability under high temperature redox conditions and high selectivity [36]. Perovskite structured oxides, one of the most successful redox catalysts, have been paid much attention for chemical looping application because of their unique bulk and surface properties for oxygen vacancy formation and elimination during reactions [23]. Perovskite-type oxides are a series of mixed oxides with a general formula of ABO3, where A is usually a lanthanide ion and/or alkaline earth metal and B is a transition metal ion [37–39]. In general, metal cations on B-site affect the catalytic activity and electrical conductivity of the perovskite-type oxides, and metal cations on A-site is in noncatalytic aspects, but they have effects on the concentration of oxygen vacancies and the valence states of the B-site cations [40]. Several combinations of A- and B-site cations can form a stable perovskite-like structure. The oxygen storage capacity, lattice oxygen mobility and catalytic properties of perovskite-type catalyst are highly tunable by partially substituting A and/or B cation by other cations [41,42]. Under certain conditions, the oxidation activity of perovskite-type oxides can be comparable to that of noble metal catalysts [43]. Among various perovskites, LaFeO3-based oxides with suitable combinations of A- and B-site cations have attracted much attention owing to the high oxygen storage capacity and redox stability at elevated reaction temperatures [40,44]. LaFeO3, which is the first perovskite to be used in chemical looping partial oxidation of CH4 to produce syngas, shows very high CO selectivity and redox stability [45,46]. Shen et al. [47] found that the exchange between the surface oxygen and lattice oxygen in LaFeO3 is rapid, and the active sites of Fe associated with the surface oxygen are highly dynamic in nature. Efforts have also been made to enhance the reactivity of LaFeO3 for chemical looping reforming of methane. The formation of three-dimensionally ordered macroporous structure can significantly improve the reactivity for CH4 oxidation and the resistance to carbon formation [48,49]. On the other side, interface engineering with the presence of CeO2 nano particles on LaFeO3 further increases the reduction degree when reacting with methane, obtaining very high yields of syngas and hydrogen [50]. Substitution of La cations at A-site is another efficient way to tune the activity of LaFeO3. The viability of different divalent A-site dopants for promoting ionic and electronic conductivity of LaFeO3 was examined, and the result shows that Sr2+ and Ca2+ emerge as the most appropriate due to the combination of low solution energy and minimal binding energies [40,51]. More interestingly, Sr2+ substitution on the La3+ site gives a minimum binding energy between Sr2+ ions and vacancy clusters, which is beneficial to the oxygen migration of the LaFeO3 perovskites [40]. In addition, the charge compensation originating from partial substitution of La3+ by Sr2+ can result in the oxidization of a fraction of Fe3+ to Fe4+ and the production of oxygen vacancy [37,52]. La1-xSrxFeO3 is reported to show nearly two orders of magnitude than LaFeO3 in redox activity [53,54]. Previous studies also indicate that Sr substitution would increase the oxygen mobility [55], inhibit methane decomposition and improve syngas selectivity [40,44]. Because of their superior redox property as well as the high activity and stability for CH4 selective oxidation, La1-xSrxFeO3 perovskites have shown super potential for chemical looping applications. In the present work, La1-xSrxFeO3 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6) perovskite oxides were prepared by a co-precipitation method, which were used as oxygen carriers for chemical looping reforming of COG to produce pure H2. According to the complicated components of COG, the reduction behaviors of different oxygen carriers by H2, CO and CH4 as well as their mixture were studied, and the results were related to the reactivity for simulated COG reforming. The competition effect of H2, CO and CH4 during their reactions with oxygen carriers was discussed in detail. An O2-assistant chemical looping reforming of COG process is proposed to obtain high H2 yield during the successive chemical looping process."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of La1-xSrxFeO3 oxygen carriers,"2.1 Synthesis of La1-xSrxFeO3 oxygen carriers La1-xSrxFeO3 oxides were prepared by a co-precipitation method. Firstly, the needed La(NO3)3·xH2O, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and Sr(NO3)2 were added into deionized water, and stirred them into mixed solution. Then the mixed solution was titrated with 8% ammonia under the condition of 70 °C water bath until the pH value reaches 9–10. Thereafter, the titrated mixed solution was continuously stirred for 3 h and then aged for 6 h at room temperature. After that, the-deionized water and absolute alcohol were used to wash and filter the mixed solution alternately for three times. The filter cake was dried at 110 °C for 12 h and then calcinated at 850 °C for 2 h under air atmosphere. Before testing, the prepared La1-xSrxFeO3 was pressed and granulated to the required size (20–40 meshes)."
3,Characterizations,"2.2 Characterizations MiniFlex600 Rigaku X-ray Diffraction (XRD) meter with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) operated at 40 kV and 15 mA was used to analyze the phase compositions of the prepared oxygen carriers. The diffraction angle scanning range was 10°∼80°, scanning rate was 2° min−1. The Raman spectra were measured by a Thermo Fisher DXRxi Raman imaging microscope. The oxygen species and surface Fe element states of oxygen carriers were obtained by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on a PHI 5000 Versaprobe II system equipped with a monochromatic Al-Ka X-rays source. Hydrogen-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was carried out on a Quantanchrome Instrument. 10% H2/Ar (25 mL min−1) as reducing agent reacted with oxygen carriers (100 mg), the reaction temperature was heated from room temperature to 900 °C and the heating rate was 10 °C min−1."
4,Reactivity tests,"2.3 Reactivity tests CO temperature programmed reduction (CO-TPR) was carried out by microreactor system (CATLAB, produced by Hiden Analytical Co., England). Before experiment, the sample (100 mg) was pretreated in flowing pure Ar atmosphere (99.99%, 50 mL min−1) for 1 h at 200 °C. Thereafter, the sample was exposed to 5% CO/Ar (50 mL min−1) from 200 °C to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The outlet gas was analyzed using an online mass spectrometer (QGA, produced by Hiden Analytical Co., England). CH4 temperature programmed reduction (CH4-TPR) was also conducted the microreactor system by using 5% CH4/Ar, and the experiment procedure is as same as that for the CO-TPR. Temperature programmed reduction of COG (COG-TPR) was carried out in a tubular fixed-bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. After the oxygen carriers (2 g and 20–40 meshes) were placed in the center of the quartz reactor and increased to 200 °C, high purity Ar was passed into the reactor for 30 min to purge the air and remove impurities that may be adsorbed on the oxygen carriers. After that, the gas was switched to a feed reaction gas (2.8% CH4, 6.0% H2, 0.3% CO2, 0.9% CO and 90% high purity Ar), which was obtained by mixing the simulated COG (28% CH4, 60% H2, 3% CO2, and 9% CO) with high-purity Ar (99.99%) at a ratio of 1:9. The oxygen carriers were heated from room temperature to 1000 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The outlet gas was analyzed online by a mass spectrometer (AMTEK dycor system 200 LCD, Pfeiffer Vacuum) and a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890A GC System, produced by Agilent Co.). The isothermal reaction between COG and oxygen carriers at 850 °C was tested in the same reactor with the COG-TPR experiment. After the oxygen carriers (2 g) with a size range of 20–40 mesh were placed in the reactor, the reactor was heated to 850 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under Ar atmosphere. Then, 10% COG/Ar was introduced into the reactor instead of Ar at a flow rate of 200 mL min−1, which was accompanied the analysis of the outlet gas by the mass spectrometer. For the successive chemical looping cycle experiment, after the reaction between COG and oxygen carriers, high purity Ar was introduced into the reactor to purge the reactor for 30 min to avoid gases mixing between the two steps. Then, the steam carried by Ar (99.99%) was introduced into the reactor at a flow rate of 200 mL min−1. The water vapor was produced by heating a flask with three necks half filled with water at 70 °C. The COG conversion/water-splitting cycle was repeated for 30 times, and Ar purging was performed between the two steps. O2-assistant chemical looping reforming process was carried out in the tubular fixed bed reactor. 5% O2/Ar was introduced at a flow rate of 200 mL min−1 to deeply oxidize the oxygen carrier after water-splitting reaction."

6,Results and discussion,
7,Structural and surface characterizations,"3.1 Structural and surface characterizations Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the prepared La1-xSrxFeO3 oxygen carriers. It can be seen that all the samples with various Sr-doping in La-site are well crystallized with the LaFeO3 perovskite structure and the diffraction peaks of Fe2O3 are observed when the Sr substitution fraction is higher 50% (x ≥ 0.5) [56]. The enlargement on the maximum diffraction peak (Fig. 2b) reveals that the peak is weakened and broadened with the increase of Sr content, which is accompanied by the slight shift to higher 2θ position. The relatively high full width at half maximum indicates the smaller grain size of LaFeO3, which is approved by the data in Table 1 . The shift of the XRD peak is attributed to the partial substitution of La3+ by a low valence cation (Sr2+). This doping may result in the generation of oxygen vacancies and/or the oxidation of a fraction of Fe3+ ions to Fe4+ due to the electronic unbalance in perovskite lattice [37]. The ionic radius of Fe4+ (0.0585 nm) is smaller than that of Fe3+ (0.0645 nm), which leads to lattice expansion (see Table 1) that contributes to the shift of the diffraction peak to higher 2θ positions [57]. It is well known that Raman spectroscopy is very sensitive to structure distortion and oxygen motion of oxides [58]. Fig. 3 displays the Raman spectra of the prepared La1-xSrxFeO3 samples. As can be seen, all the La1-xSrxFeO3 oxides show similar band with pure LaFeO3 at 200–1800 cm−1, with the Raman bands observed at 163, 227, 293, 408, 1315 cm−1. Similar Raman bands are also proved by Popa et al. [58] and Wang et al. [59]. They ascribe the bands at 163, 227, 293, 408 cm−1 to the one phonon scattering, and 1315 cm−1 to the two phonon scattering. It is obvious that, compared with the pure LaFeO3, the main band at 1315 cm−1 significantly weakens and broadens with the increase of Sr content, indicating the lower crystallite size of oxygen carriers. This is consistent with the XRD results. The oxygen species and surface Fe element states of various oxygen carriers obtained by the XPS technique are shown in Fig. 4 . The corresponding O 1s spectra and oxygen species relative proportion of different oxygen carriers are shown in Fig. 4a. As can be seen, two major peaks are identified on all the four La1-xSrxFeO3 samples. The major peak with low binding energy (lower than 530.0 eV) is assigned to lattice oxygen (denoted as OI), and the other peak with high binding energy (higher than 530.0 eV) is assigned to adsorbed oxygen (denoted as OII), which is related to the concentration of oxygen vacancies [60,61]. Adsorbed oxygen (OII) percentage increases with the increase of Sr doping and La0.5Sr0.5FeO3 has the highest proportion with a value of 55.02%. It has been reported that the lattice oxygen (OI) is conducive to the partial oxidation of CH4, while the adsorbed oxygen (OII) is beneficial to the complete oxidation of CH4 [62]. Therefore, the higher content of OII in sample La0.5Sr0.5FeO3 tends to complete oxidation CH4 to CO2. In the case of Fe 2p spectrum (Fig. 4b), three characteristic peaks of Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2 are detected on the different samples except La0.8Sr0.2FeO3. The peak position of Fe 2p1/2 for all the four samples is located at ca. 724 eV, which is the characteristic of Fe3+ ions. It is noticed that only a small satellite peaks and one characteristic peaks of Fe 2p3/2 at ca. 710 eV are detected on La0.8Sr0.2FeO3, while the other three oxygen carriers with more Sr content have two characteristic peaks of Fe 2p3/2 at ca. 710 eV and 711 eV. The two characteristic peaks of Fe 2p3/2 is typical of Fe ions with high oxidation states of Fe3+ and Fe4+ [63,64]. This change indicates that doping of Sr at A site strongly affect valence states of Fe ion, whereas the Fe3+ ions are still the primary component for all the samples [40]. Meanwhile, it is also observed that the Fe 2p spectrum shifts to higher binding energy with increasing the Sr content, indicating an increase in formal charge due to a partial conversion of Fe3+ ions to Fe4+ [65]."
8,Reducibility,"3.2 Reducibility Because COG mainly contains three reducing components (CO, H2 and CH4), the reduction performance of La1-xSrxFeO3 perovskite is investigated by H2-TPR, CO-TPR and CH4-TPR, respectively. Fig. 5 shows the H2-TPR profiles of various La1-xSrxFeO3 samples. As can be seen, LaFeO3 has two faint reduction peaks below 500 °C and a main reduction peak at 600 °C. The TPR profiles of Sr-doped La1-xSrxFeO3 are compared with the undoped LaFeO3. The Sr-doped La1-xSrxFeO3 oxides also exhibit three reduction peaks, but the two reduction peaks at low temperature become more intense with increasing of Sr-substitution. He et al. [40] reported that the reduction of adsorbed oxygen happens at a relative low temperature, and the enhancement of the low temperature reduction peak results from the increase of adsorbed oxygen. The peak at high temperature is attributed to deep reduction of iron cations in perovskite lattice. He and the co-workers [37] reported similar H2-TPR results of La1-xSrxFeO3 perovskites, and they find that all reduction peaks shift to higher temperature compared with LaFeO3 due to the slightly decrease of oxygen activity with Sr amount increasing. The reduction peak areas, representing the hydrogen consumption, increase as the Sr substitution degree increase, which suggests the enhancement of hydrogen consumption capacity of the oxygen carriers after Sr-doping increases. When the doping content exceeds 50% (x > 5), the reduction peaks are overlapped, indicating that the reduction of surface oxygen and lattice oxygen becomes overlapping. Fig. 6 shows the evolution of CO and CO2 curves with temperature in the TPR process. The initial reaction temperature of CO is about 200 °C for all the samples, which results in the formation of CO2. The CO2 intensity increases with temperature to the top at temperatures lower than 500 °C, and then it decreases to very low level at 700 °C. The peak area of CO2 for LaFeO3 is very small, but it is obviously enhanced with increasing of Sr-substitution. In addition, the reduction peak areas that represent the CO consumption increases as the Sr substitution content increasing, which suggests that Sr-doping improves the reactivity of oxygen carriers for CO oxidation. Among different samples, La0.5Fe0.5O3 shows the largest area of CO consumption. It should be stressed that the temperature for La1-xSrxFeO3 oxygen carrier reacting with CO is much lower than that of H2, indicating that La1-xSrxFeO3 is more reducible by CO. Fig. 7 shows the temperature programmed reactions between methane and different oxygen carriers (CH4-TPR). It can be seen that the reaction of La1-xSrxFeO3 and CH4 mainly produces CO and H2, and almost no CO2 can be observed. This indicates that La1-xSrxFeO3 oxygen carriers tend to selective oxidize CH4 to syngas. The initial reaction temperature between CH4 and pure LaFeO3 is about 700 °C, and the intensities of CO and H2 originating from methane oxidation sharply increase with the temperature. When the reaction temperature increase to 800 °C, CO intensity decreases and H2 continues to rise, indicating the occurrence of methane cracking. For the Sr-substituted samples, similar phenomena are also observed, but the temperature for CH4 cracking increases and the intensity of H2 is weakened, indicating that the partial inhibition of carbon deposition formation. When the doping amount enhanced to 50% (x = 0.5), no decomposition of methane occurs even at 900 °C. This indicates that the substitution of Sr at A site of LaFeO3 can inhibit the decomposition of methane, which is similar with the observations of He et al. [37]. Meanwhile, when the doping amount x is higher than 0.5, very limited CO and H2 are observed, indicating the poor reactivity for methane oxidation. Compared with the CO-TPR and H2-TPR results, the CH4 reaction temperature is much higher, which means that the reaction conditions of La1-xSrxFeO3 with COG are as same as that of CH4 oxidation to obtain the relatively high conversion for all the component (CO, H2 and methane)."
9,Reactivity for COG oxidation,"3.3 Reactivity for COG oxidation Fig. 8 shows the evolutions of CH4, H2, CO and CO2 during the temperature programmed reactions between COG and different oxygen carriers (COG-TPR). The pure LaFeO3 sample shows a slight drop process of H2 in the range of 400–750 °C, and its CO content lower than the initial content as well as CO2 concentration higher than the theoretical value are detected during the same period. According to the H2-TPR and CO-TPR results, it is attributed to the consumption of CO and H2 at relatively low temperatures. When the temperature is higher than 730 °C, the concentration of CH4 starts to decrease, which is accompanied by the enhancement of CO and H2 concentration. This implies the occurrence of partial oxidation of methane to syngas. Compared with LaFeO3, Sr-doped perovskite shows stronger methane conversion capacity? H2 consumption peaks at ca. 400 °C and 600 °C, and CO2 content that produced by CO conversion is higher, indicating higher consumption of H2 and CO at low temperatures. This should be attributed to the relatively high concentration of active oxygen on the sample, as observed by XPS measurement. It is also noticed that the initial temperature of methane conversion is essentially unchanged with the doping of Sr. However, the intensity of H2 is lower than that of LaFeO3, and the ratio of H2 to CO is close to 2.0. This indicates that the H2 is mainly produced by partial oxidation of methane instead of methane complete oxidation, which evidences that the doping of Sr inhibits the decomposition of methane. It should be highlighted that the reactivity of perovskite oxygen carrier is sharply decreased when the content of Sr increases to 60% (x = 0.6). According to COG-TPR and CH4-TPR, 850 °C is chosen as the reaction temperature for isothermal reaction with COG. Fig. 9 shows the evolutions of CH4, H2, CO and CO2 during the isothermal reaction between COG and different oxygen carriers at 850 °C. As shown in Fig. 9 a1-a4, the reaction with COG is roughly divided into two stages. In the early stage, almost all the reducible components (H2, CO and CH4) in COG are oxidized by the oxygen carrier, which generates amounts of CO2. Thereafter, the concentration of both CO and H2 increase, and CO2 concentration gradually decreases. At the end of the reaction, the concentrations of all the components return their theoretical values, which indicates no lattice oxygen coverts CO, H2 or CH4. Generally, the generation of CO2 in the initial stage is due to oxidation of CO and CH4 by the active absorption oxygen on the surface of oxygen carriers, while the increase of CO and H2 concentrations thereafter must be attributed to the selective oxidation of methane to syngas. When most of the reducible oxygen in the oxygen carriers have been consumed, the concentrations of H2 and CH4 further increase until they reach to the theoretical values. With the increase of Sr doping, the period for CO2 formation become longer, indicating more methane is converted to CO2 and H2O. In addition, higher Sr content also results in the extension of reaction time for the consumption of H2, CO and CH4, which indicates that the presence of Sr in LaFeO3 increases the amount of reducible oxygen in oxygen carrier for COG oxidation. In the water splitting step (seen Fig. 9 b1–b4), the formation of H2 is very quick. However, CO is detected for all the samples and the concentration of CO decreases with the increase of Sr content. For the La0.5Sr0.5FeO3 sample, the concentration of formed CO is only 0.15% in the produced H2. This further approves that the doping of Sr can inhibit decomposition of methane to form carbon deposition. Among different samples, the La0.5Sr0.5FeO3 shows the longest time for H2 generation with high concentration, which results in the highest yield of H2. According to isothermal reactions, the quantitative calculation on oxygen consumption in oxygen carriers, CH4 conversion, H2 consumption in the reduction step and the yields of H2 and CO as well as the H2 purity in the oxidation step over different samples are summarized in Table 2 . As can be seen, the oxygen consumption in oxygen carriers is increased with the increase of Sr doping from 20% (x = 0.2) to 50%. The amount of oxygen consumption for La0.5Sr0.5FeO3 is more than twice that of pure LaFeO3. Accordingly, the hydrogen consumption and CH4 conversion increase at the reduction stage by COG. In the water splitting step, the H2 yield shows a similar trend when changing the Sr content in the samples. A large number of CO originating from the oxidation of carbon deposition are observed over pure LaFeO3 and La1-xSrxFeO3 samples with relatively low Sr contents, which reduce the purity of H2 to be lower than 97.5%. When the Sr content is increased to 40%–50% (x = 0.4), there is only trace of CO can be observed. It should be stressed that hydrogen is also consumed by oxygen carriers during the reduction step owing to the enrichment of H2 in COG. However, data in Table 2 reveals that the H2 yield in the water splitting step is much higher than the H2 consumption in the reduction step, which indicates that the chemical looping reaction produce more H2 than the original H2 amount in COG due to the contribution of CH4 and CO. Among the tested samples, the La0.5Sr0.5FeO3 shows the highest H2 yield (3.34 mmol g−1) and purity (99.85%). To identify the stability of different oxygen carriers, successive chemical looping testing was performed over the LaFeO3, La0.8Sr0.2FeO3, La0.7Sr0.3FeO3, La0.6Sr0.4FeO3 and La0.5Sr0.5FeO3 at 850 °C. The hydrogen consumption and CH4 conversion in the oxidation step as well as the hydrogen yield and hydrogen purity in the water split step were calculated based on the original experiment data, as shown in Fig. 10 . As shown in the Fig. 10a, the hydrogen consumption of LaFeO3 is quite low in the first cycle of the oxidation stage, but then the hydrogen consumption increases and tends to be stable with the cycling. This is the opposite of CH4 conversion, which is very high for the fresh sample but sharply decreases (from 55.72% to 30.25%) with the cycling. This indicates that there is a competition effect between CH4 and H2 conversion because H2 is one of the products from methane selective oxidation. After the first cycle, the activity of the oxygen carrier decreases, which results in the decrease in CH4 conversion. Since H2 is easier to be reduced than CH4, the decrease in the activity of the oxygen carrier show relatively low effect on H2 conversion, resulting in the increase in the H2 consumption. Compared with the pure LaFeO3, the Sr-doped samples show similar trends for the evolution of H2 consumption and methane conversion during the redox cycling. However, all the Sr-doped samples show much higher H2 consumption and methane conversion than the pure LaFeO3 sample. Among the four Sr-doped samples, La0.5Sr0.5FeO3 exhibits the largest methane conversion and hydrogen consumption, which suffers a sharp decrease in the first cycle and then keeps stable during the further cycling. Fig. 10b shows changes of H2 yield and H2 purity in the water splitting step during the redox cycling. Similar with the methane conversion and hydrogen consumption in the first step, the H2 yield sharply decreases after the first cycle for all the samples. However, the purity of hydrogen is basically unchanged with the increase of cycle number. Compared with the pure LaFeO3, the Sr-doped oxygen carriers show much higher hydrogen yield and hydrogen purity, and the La0.5Sr0.5FeO3 sample owns the highest hydrogen yield and hydrogen purity. The reason for the sharp declines of the methane conversion in the first step and the hydrogen yield in the second step after first cycle in the whole chemical looping may be that the water oxidation may not fully recover the reduced oxygen carriers, which results in the loss of active oxygen in the oxygen carriers after the first cycle. It is worth emphasizing that the hydrogen yield in the water splitting step is much higher than the hydrogen consumption in the reduction step for all the samples. For instance, hydrogen consumption in the reduction step for La0.5Sr0.5FeO3 is only 1.01 mmol g−1, but the hydrogen yield in the water splitting step is 3.34 mmol g−1. Even after a sharp decline in the redox cycles, the hydrogen yield is twice as that for hydrogen consumption. The additional H2 in the water splitting step should be contributed by the conversion of methane, because the combination of the two steps in chemical looping reforming process will achieve the reforming of methane with stream to produce more H2. These data reveal that chemical looping reforming of COG to produce pure H2 is feasible."
10,Competition effect of different reducing components,"3.4 Competition effect of different reducing components In order to investigate the competition effect of different reducing components in COG conversion, temperature programed reductions (TPR) of La0.5Sr0.5FeO3 oxygen carrier by CO, H2, CH4 and their mixtures were performed, as shown in Fig. 11 . The CO-TPR shows two peaks at to 400 °C and 700 °C, which are attributed to the consumption of highly active surface oxygen at low temperatures and reduction of bulk lattice oxygen at high temperatures, respectively. For CH4-TPR, CH4 starts to react at 570 °C, which results in the formation of a weak CO2 peak. Then, the oxidation of methane to CO and H2 occurs at 660 °C, and the contents of CO and H2 increase with the temperature. As for H2-TPR, three reduction peaks at ca. 450 °C, 650 °C and higher than 800 °C are observed respectively. According to the three temperature programmed reactions (CO-TPR, CH4-TPR, H2-TPR), the reaction of La0.5Sr0.5FeO3 oxygen carrier with CO and H2 can occur at relative low temperatures, but the selective oxidation of methane to syngas needs temperatures higher than 800 °C. In the CO + CH4-TPR, CO and oxygen carrier start to react at low temperature to produce CO2, and the content of CO2 increases with temperature. The reaction of CH4 with oxygen carrier starts at 600 °C and accelerates at 760 °C, which generates numbers of CO and H2. When the temperature is higher than 900 °C, the formation of CO and H2 is strongly enhanced but the concentrating of CO2 is sharply decreased. Compared with the CH4-TPR, the intensity of H2 is almost the same during the temperature from 800 to 1000 °C, but the intensity of CO is much higher for CO + CH4-TPR. This indicates that the formation of CO due to methane oxidation inhibit the oxidation of CO. On the other hand, the presence of CO does not affect the reaction equilibrium of methane to syngas at high temperatures. In the case of H2 + CH4-TPR, the reaction trend of H2 is consistent with that of H2-TPR before 680 °C, and then the conversion of CH4 results in a significant increase in the intensity of H2. According to the centration of CH4, the detected H2 concentration is much higher than the theoretical one, which indicates that the consumption of H2 in the mixed gases is inhibited due to the methane oxidation. However, the presence of H2 cannot reduce the reaction equilibrium of methane to syngas at high temperature. From the COG-TPR, it can be seen that H2 and CO preferentially react with oxygen carrier to generate CO2 and H2O at low temperatures, and methane can be selectively oxidized to CO and H2 at relatively high temperatures (> 800 °C). The presence of CO and H2 shows limited effect on the conversion of methane, but the oxidation of methane to syngas inhibits the consumption of CO and H2."
11,O2-assistant chemical looping reforming process,"3.5 O2-assistant chemical looping reforming process In the previous chemical looping cycles (see Fig. 10), both methane conversion in the reduction step and hydrogen yield in the oxidation step suffer a sharp decrease after the first cycle, which is likely attributed to the weak oxidation ability of water vapor. It has been reported that water can only oxidize Fe or FeO to Fe3O4 instead of Fe2O3 [66]. In this case, we propose an O2-assistant chemical looping reforming process to fully recover the reduced oxygen carrier. At each cycle, the reduced oxygen carrier is further oxidized by air after the water splitting step. Since the oxidation of reduced oxygen carrier by air is highly exothermic, the released heat can be used to preheat the COG for the endothermic reactions in COG conversion. The methane conversion in the reduction step and H2 yields in the water splitting step during the regular redox process and the O2-assistant redox process over La0.5Sr0.5FeO3 oxygen carrier are compared in Fig. 12 . It is obviously that both the methane conversion and hydrogen yield sharp decrease after the first cycle in the regular redox process, while only a slight drop is observed at the same condition for the O2-assistant process. The activity of La0.5Sr0.5FeO3 oxygen carrier is very stable during 30 O2-assistant redox cycles. These results show that the reduced oxygen carrier can be fully regenerated by introducing oxygen after water splitting, which strongly improves H2 yield and the stability of oxygen carrier."
12,Conclusions,"A series of La1-xSrxFeO3 perovskite oxygen carriers were synthesized as oxygen carrier for chemical looping reforming of COG to produce pure H2. The results show that CO and H2 are very reactive to reduce La1-xSrxFeO3 oxygen carriers, while the reaction with CH4 requires very high temperatures (e.g., 850 °C). The selective oxidation of methane to syngas is the rate-limiting reaction for COG conversion. The Sr doping at A site of LaFeO3 perovskite strongly improves the reactivity for methane conversion at the reduction stage, which results in high H2 yield in the water splitting step. In addition, a suitable amount of Sr in LaFeO3 also inhabit the formation of carbon deposition during methane or CO conversion, which is beneficial for increasing the purity of H2 during water splitting. Among the tested sample, La0.5Sr0.5FeO3 shows the highest methane conversion (67.82%), H2 yield (3.34 mmol g−1) and H2 purity (99.85%). Competition effect of different reducing components (H2, CO and CH4) also exists in COG conversion. The presence of CO and H2 shows limited effect on the conversion of methane, but the oxidation of methane to syngas can inhibit the consumption of CO and H2. This is beneficial for obtaining relatively high methane conversion at the step for COG oxidation, which results in relatively high H2 yield in the water splitting step. In the successive redox experiment, both the CH4 conversion and the H2 yield suffer a sharp decrease after the first cycle due to the weak oxidation ability of water vapor. However, the proposed O2-assistant redox process can address this issue, obtaining high activity and redox stability for H2 production via chemical reforming of COG."
