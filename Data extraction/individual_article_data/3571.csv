0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is widely considered as a promising alternative energy carrier due to its clean, efficient and non-polluting characteristics [1–3]. Generally, hydrogen gas can be generated from steam reforming of hydrocarbons, electrolysis of water and auto-thermal processes [4,5]. However, these methods are cost-intensive owing to high-energy requirements. Much attention has recently been paid to produce hydrogen through dark fermentation because this process is renewable and environmentally friendly [6–8]. In addition, dark fermentation can utilize low-value materials as fermentation substrates, which can contribute to reducing the cost of biohydrogen production. The quantity of food waste collected and disposed in China amounts to 65,000 tons per day, and the main disposal method for food waste is landfill (90.5%) [9]. Food waste contains high contents of volatile solids (85–95%) and moisture content (75–85%), which can create a series of problems such as putrid smells and leachate polluting underground waters in the landfill treatment process [4]. As a result, food waste has become one of the most serious environmental problems [10–12]. Main compositions of food waste, such as carbohydrates, proteins and fats, are potential sources for hydrogen production [13,14]. In some studies, the feasibility of dark fermentative hydrogen production from food waste has been reported [6,15]. Food waste consists mainly of starch and protein which make food waste to be an economical source for biofuels production. However, nutrients stored in food waste are in the form of macromolecules (such as starch and protein) which have to be broken into utilizable forms (glucose and free amino nitrogen) before utilized by microorganisms for fermentative hydrogen production. Han et al. developed a novel combined bioprocess based on enzymatic hydrolysis and dark fermentation for hydrogen production (and ethanol production) from food waste (and bakery waste) which could effectively accelerate the hydrolysis speed, improve nutrient conversion efficiency and increase hydrogen production [16]. Nevertheless, dark fermentation application has been limited by the low energy conversion efficiencies since many soluble metabolites, such as volatile fatty acids (VFAs), are produced during the hydrogen production process from food waste. Compared with dark fermentation alone, a two-stage process of coupled dark fermentation and algal cultivation is more promising to improve the energy conversion efficiency (Fig. 1 ). Microalgal biomass can be produced by using simple organic compounds (e.g., VFAs) as both carbon and energy sources through heterotrophic culture [17–19]. Moreover, VFAs can be converted into acetyl-CoA, which is a direct precursor for lipid synthesis in algal cells [20–22]. The effluent of dark fermentation contains large amounts of VFAs and can act as suitable feedstock for algal growth and lipid accumulation. To date, little information is available on the hydrogen and lipid production characteristics from food waste by coupling dark fermentation and microalgal culture. Therefore, this study investigated the energy production potentials of three main types of food waste in coupled system, including waste carbohydrates (WCS), waste proteins (WPS) and waste fats (WFS). The waste substrates were utilized in dark fermentation to produce biohydrogen and short chain organic acids, which were further converted into microalgal biomass containing lipids. The energy conversion efficiencies of various waste substrates were examined. Furthermore, the performance of the coupled system in long-term operation was evaluated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Bacteria and microalgae,"2.1 Bacteria and microalgae The seed sludge used in the present study was obtained from a wastewater treatment plant in Harbin, China. For hydrogen production, the sludge was heat-treated at 100 °C for 60 min to inhibit the hydrogen-consuming microorganisms and to enrich the hydrogen-producing bacteria [23]. The microalgal strain Scenedesmus sp. R-16 with high lipid production capacity was adopted in all experiments [24]. The microalgal cells were cultured on glucose supplemented BG11 medium at temperature of 25 ± 1 °C in dark environment [24]. Methanogenic bacteria were enriched from the sludge and used as the inoculum for methanogenesis [8]."
3,Batch and continuous operations,"2.2 Batch and continuous operations 2.2.1 Batch culture mode Hydrogen production in batch experiments were conducted in 250 mL reactors with a working volume of 150 mL. According to previous studies [13,25], three substrates (potato powder, peptone, and glycerol) were used to simulate WCS, WPS and WFS, respectively. The initial concentration of WCS, WPS and WFS in each experiment was set at 5.0 g L−1. Other mineral and vitamin solution were prepared according to the methods described in the literature [25,26]. The initial pH of the culture medium was adjusted to 6.5 ± 0.2 and nitrogen gas was applied to create anaerobic environment in dark fermentation. Temperature of dark fermentation was kept at 35 ± 1 °C using a temperature-controlled shaker (130 rpm). Effluents from dark fermentation were collected and used to cultivate microalgae. Prior to use, the effluents were centrifuged at 9000g for 10 min to remove the solids and the pH of supernatant was adjusted to 7.0 ± 0.2. The reactors for microalgal cultivation were shaken at 130 rpm at constant temperature of 25 ± 1 °C in darkness [27]. Each test was run in triplicate. To compare the mean of hydrogen and lipid yields, the data were statistically analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) [28,29]. 2.2.2 Continuous culture mode Continuous hydrogen production was conducted in 1.0 L anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) and the working volume was 0.6 L. The operation temperature, feedstock concentration, and hydraulic retention time (HRT) used in continuous mode were 35 ± 1 °C, 5.0 g L−1, and 24 h, respectively. In every cycle of operation, half (0.3 L) of culture medium was replaced by fresh medium of 0.3 L. Sequencing batch reactor (SBR) with total volume of 1.0 L and working volume of 0.6 L was applied in the continuous algal lipid production. The SBR was started with batch culture period of 96 h. After that, half of the medium (0.3 L) was removed and the same volume of dark fermentative effluent medium was supplied. This process was repeated every 48 h in the total cultivation period and the HRT was 96 h. On the other hand, the waste bread used in this study contained 46.5% starch, 11.5% protein, 3% fat, 37% water, and 2% ash. The initial concentrations of TN and TP in waste bread medium were 100 and 20 mg L−1, respectively. The dark fermentative effluent from waste bread was used as the feed for methane production. The HRT and temperature for methane fermentation were 288 h and 35 ± 1 °C, respectively."
4,Energy conversion analysis,"2.3 Energy conversion analysis The specific heat values of hydrogen, lipids, WCS, WPS, and WFS were 142.0, 36.3, 16.7, 23.0, and 17.28 kJ g−1, respectively [20,30–32]. The energy conversion efficiency (ECE) and total energy conversion efficiency (TECE) were calculated according to Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively. (1) ECE ( % ) = Heat value of hydrogen ( kJ ) or Heat value of lipids ( kJ ) Heat value of substrate ( kJ ) × 100 % (2) TECE ( % ) = Heat value of hydrogen ( kJ ) + Heat value of lipids ( kJ ) Heat value of substrate ( kJ ) × 100 %"
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The pH value of the culture medium was adjusted with 1 M NaOH or 1 M HCl solution to obtain the desired initial pH, and the pH was monitored with a digital pH meter (Mettler FE20K, Switzerland). The produced gas was sampled from the head space of the reactors by using a gas-tight glass syringe. Hydrogen and methane contents were determined by a gas chromatograph (Agilent 4890D, USA) equipped with thermal conductivity detector using argon as the carrier gas at the flow rate of 30 mL min−1. Temperatures of injection, oven and detector were 120, 35, and 120 °C, respectively. Biomass concentration was measured by filtering samples through 0.22 μm Millipore filter, drying at 105 °C, and determining the constant dry weight. The lipid content of microalgae was measured via the methods described previously [24]. The TN and TP were determined based on the methods described in the literature [33]. VFAs and alcohols were measured by a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890A, USA) equipped with flame ionization detector using nitrogen as carrier gas at the flow rate of 50 mL min−1. Before analysis, the liquid samples were centrifuged at 9000g for 5 min to remove solids. Temperatures of injection port, column and detector were 250, 300, and 300 °C, respectively."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Dark fermentative hydrogen production by using main substrates of food waste,"3.1 Dark fermentative hydrogen production by using main substrates of food waste Three typical compositions of food waste, namely, WCS, WPS, and WFS were used to investigate the effect of waste source on dark fermentative hydrogen production (Fig. 2 A and B). Compared with WCS, the WPS and WFS were slowly consumed by hydrogen-producing microorganisms, and the lag time for hydrogen production using WPS and WFS were 6 and 12 h, respectively. Furthermore, the highest cumulative hydrogen volume of 668.3 ± 36.5 mL L−1, hydrogen yield of 133.66 ± 7.31 mL g−1 substrate and hydrogen production rate of 9.28 ± 0.51 mL−1 L−1 h−1 were obtained when WCS were used as the feedstock. WFS were also acceptable feedstock which exhibited lower cumulative hydrogen volume (538.3 ± 28.4 mL L−1), hydrogen yield (107.66 ± 5.68 mL g−1 substrate) and hydrogen production rate (7.48 ± 0.39 mL L−1 h−1). Additionally, WPS resulted in poor cumulative hydrogen volume (116.7 ± 6.1 mL L−1), hydrogen yield (23.34 ± 1.21 mL g−1 substrate) and hydrogen production rate (1.62 ± 0.08 mL L−1 h−1). The statistical difference was found to be significant (ANOVA, P < 0.05). The results indicated that waste source exhibited significant influence on dark fermentation. During the anaerobic degradation of proteins, some intermediates like amino acids could be produced, and these amino acids can be reductive and act as electron donors (e.g., glutamate) [34]. In addition, some amino acids are oxidative and can act as electron acceptors (e.g., proline) and others could act as both electron donors and acceptors (e.g., threonine) [35]. The reduction of some amino acids might consume the electrons produced by oxidation of other amino acids, which can induce few electrons available in the hydrogen production process [34]. This indicated that hydrogen may be consumed during the dark fermentation, and the WPS were not suitable feedstock for hydrogen production. With utilization of waste substrates, liquid organic by-products (VFAs and alcohols) were produced (Fig. 3 A). For the dark fermentation of WCS, acetic acid (10.12 ± 0.53 mM) and butyric acid (6.45 ± 0.36 mM) appeared to be the main metabolism products, plus small amounts of propionic acid, valeric acid and ethanol. In addition, major compositions of liquid by-products for WPS were acetic acid (11.18 ± 0.43 mM), propionic acid (4.35 ± 0.22 mM) and butyric acid (3.78 ± 0.21 mM), while the contents of valeric acid and ethanol were lower. Further, main metabolic products for WFS were acetic acid (5.27 ± 0.27 mM) and ethanol (6.51 ± 0.23 mM), whereas the contents of propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, and propanediol were lower. The statistical differences were found to be significant (ANOVA, P < 0.05), which revealed that compositions of soluble metabolites for the three waste substrates had great difference. Different compositions of by-products could be caused by the different fermentation pathways of the three waste substrates [36–38]. The high butyric acid fraction shows that the pathway of starch is butyric acid-type fermentation [39]. Starch is degraded by amylolytic enzymes and broken into small molecules, which are further used for production of hydrogen and VFAs (e.g., acetic acid and butyric acid) [36]. Moreover, proteins are hydrolyzed by extracellular enzymes into amino acids, which can be degraded to a range of products through the Stickland reaction, oxidative deamination or reductive deamination from sole amino acid [38,40]. These products could include various VFAs, ammonia, and a small amount of hydrogen [40]. In the dark fermentation of glycerol, the soluble metabolites are produced via the oxidative and reductive pathways [41]. For oxidative pathway, glycerol is converted into pyruvate, which is an intermediate product and might be transferred into different by-products, such as ethanol, acetic acid and butyric acid [42]. For reductive pathway, glycerol is converted into propanediol via the production of an intermediate product 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde [43]. However, residual metabolites in effluents might give off unpleasant odor and become potential threat to the environment [15]. Therefore, effluents from various waste substrates were further utilized by microalgae to convert soluble metabolites into lipids."
8,Microalgal lipid production with dark fermentative effluents of various waste substrates,"3.2 Microalgal lipid production with dark fermentative effluents of various waste substrates Microalgae can grow on the effluents of all the waste substrates (Fig. 4 A and B). Waste carbohydrates effluent (WCSE) led to the highest biomass concentration of 0.95 ± 0.05 g L−1, lipid content of 33.2 ± 1.8% and lipid productivity of 52.6 ± 1.1 mg L−1 d−1. Moreover, poor biomass concentration (0.38 ± 0.02 g L−1) and lipid productivity (19.3 ± 0.8 mg L−1 d−1) were obtained when waste fats effluent (WFSE) was used as feedstock. This might be caused by the low VFAs concentrations in WFS (Fig. 3A). Notably, although VFAs concentrations in waste proteins effluent (WPSE) were the highest among the three effluents, the lowest biomass of 0.29 ± 0.01 g L−1 and lipid productivity of 9.0 ± 0.1 mg L−1 d−1 were acquired. The statistical differences were found to be significant (ANOVA, P < 0.05), which indicated that the biomass and lipid production performances from various dark fermentative effluents significantly differed. Protein is composed of various amino acids, and one of the final fermentative products of protein is ammonium [26]. It has been found that large amounts of ammonium can be released in the culture medium when waste proteins are degraded [13]. Excess ammonium may be toxic to algal cells and can inhibit the formation of adenosine triphosphate in microalgae [44]. Thus, the biomass and lipid yields were quite low in WPSE reactors. On the other hand, the concentrations of liquid organic products in various effluents were monitored to investigate the mechanism of feedstock utilization in algal cultivation (Fig. 3B). Only about 35% of the VFAs contained in WPSE were utilized, which might be due to the growth-inhibitory effect of ammonium. In the fermentation of WCSE and WFSE, almost all VFAs were consumed by the algal cells and the total concentrations of VFAs in culture medium were below 0.6 mM at the end of cultivation. Nevertheless, it was found that there were still some alcohols in the final culture medium, especially for WFSE. Previous studies showed that although Scenedesmus sp. cannot assimilate alcohols, the alcohols in medium had negligible effect on the growth and lipid accumulation of microalgae [45]. Pervaporation separation technology has inherent selectivity for low concentration of alcohols, and it has been successfully applied in fermentation broth for alcohols recovery [46]. Thus, the residual alcohols in effluents of waste substrates can be recovered by using pervaporation separation to produce high concentration of alcohols. Based on above results, the energy conversion efficiencies of various waste substrates were investigated to ascertain the optimal feedstock for the coupled hydrogen and lipid production system (Table 1 ). In hydrogen production stage, the ECE from WCS, WPS and WFS were 10.14%, 1.29% and 7.89%, respectively. Energy conversion was significantly enhanced in the coupled system, and the TECE from WCS, WPS and WFS reached 24.06%, 2.87% and 12.94%, respectively. For industrial application, continuous operation is necessary to examine the stability and productivity of the coupled system. Among the three main substrates of food waste, WCS exhibited remarkable energy production potential and thus was adopted as fermentation feedstock in the continuous hydrogen and lipid production."
9,Continuous energy production with waste carbohydrates as feedstock in the coupled system of dark fermentation and microalgal culture,"3.3 Continuous energy production with waste carbohydrates as feedstock in the coupled system of dark fermentation and microalgal culture To test the operational stability of the coupled system, continuous hydrogen and lipid production was carried out. At the beginning of the continuous operation, the hydrogen production increased gradually and the ASBR became stable on the eighth day (Fig. 5 A). The average hydrogen production rate in the stable operation period reached 741.4 mL L−1 d−1. Accordingly, the compositions of soluble metabolites in continuous operation were similar to those of batch cultivation, which consisted mainly of acetic acid (12.25 mM) and butyric acid (6.68 mM), followed by small amounts of propionic acid, valeric acid and ethanol (Fig. 5B). This revealed that the fermentation type for hydrogen production was butyric acid-type fermentation [10]. Furthermore, microalgae can utilize the fermentative effluent from ASBR to produce biomass and lipids in SBR (Fig. 6 A). In the initial period of algal culture, the microalgal cells and lipids increased rapidly, and the concentrations of biomass and lipid reached 0.91 and 0.31 g L−1 on the fourth day, respectively. After the start-up stage, the SBR entered continuous mode and became steady on the eighth day. The average biomass and lipid concentrations were 1.12 and 0.4 g L−1, respectively. Compared with batch culture, continuous culture exhibited high consumption rate of VFAs. In each cycle of culture, the concentrations of VFAs decreased rapidly and the VFAs were almost completely utilized at the end of cultivation (Fig. 6B). Some previous reports showed the diauxic growth of algae on mixtures of VFAs, i.e. one type of VFA was used preferentially before another [47,48]. When microorganisms grew with multiple carbon sources, they preferred to exhaust the one that can sustain a higher growth rate [49]. A sequential assimilation of acetic acid and butyric acid was observed by Turon et al. [49]. Acetic acid was first taken up by microalgae, and butyric acid removal began after complete exhaustion of acetic acid [50]. Butyric acid and propanoic acid removal could be inhibited by the presence of acetic acid in the culture medium [48]. Fei et al. pointed out that the uptakes of butyric acid and propanoic acid were accelerated after acetic acid exhaustion [47]. It is worth noting that the yields of hydrogen and lipid from continuous operation were higher than those of batch tests. In continuous sequencing batch culture mode, half of culture medium can be replaced by fresh medium at set intervals, which is favorable to maintain the log growth phase of microbes and achieve high productivities [17]. Therefore, more energy can be recovered in the continuous operation."
10,Comparison of different coupled systems with waste bread as feedstock,"3.4 Comparison of different coupled systems with waste bread as feedstock A coupled system of dark fermentation and methanogenesis was used to compare with the hydrogen and algal lipid production system. Waste bread was applied in the coupled systems as it was a high starch containing raw material [16]. The comparative results for energy production and nutrients removal from different coupled systems are shown in Fig. 7 . The specific heat value of the methane used was 55.6 kJ g−1 [25]. The average hydrogen production rate, lipid production rate and methane production rate were 290.5 mL L−1 d−1, 40 mg L−1 d−1 and 29.3 mL L−1 d−1, respectively (Fig. 7A and C). The average energy production rate in algal culture (1.45 kJ L−1 d−1) was higher than that of methanogenesis (1.16 kJ L−1 d−1). Moreover, the algal culture process was more efficient in nutrients removal compared with methanogenesis process. The average TN and TP removal efficiencies reached 63.3% and 62.5% in algal culture, while the average TN and TP removal efficiencies were only 17.7% and 26% in methanogenesis (Fig. 7B and D). Dark fermentation is not a standalone waste treatment process exactly because it produces high by-products which should not be released into the environment. Although methanogenesis can recover some energy from the dark fermentative effluent, it does not perform well in nutrients removal. The coupled system of dark fermentation and algal culture can be more promising in both energy recovery and wastewater treatment. The results clearly indicated the potential of using the coupled system of dark fermentation and algal cultivation for continuous hydrogen and lipid production from food waste, especially for starch-rich waste. This study firstly investigated the energy recovery by the coupled system in long-term operation with main substrates of food waste as the feedstock. Coupled dark fermentation and algal culture showed promising prospect, and it produced more energy and removed more nutrients compared with coupled dark fermentation and methanogenesis. For practical application, scaled-up study is essential to improve the performance of the continuous coupled hydrogen and lipid production system. Furthermore, the techno-economic feasibility should also be evaluated for industrial application [51]. More wastes can be applied in future work to increase the economic viability and enhance the efficiency of the coupled dark fermentation and algal culture system."
11,Conclusions,"Coupled system of dark fermentation and algal culture was successfully applied to produce hydrogen and lipids from main substrates of food waste in batch and continuous operations. Compared with waste proteins and waste fats, waste carbohydrates were more suitable for energy production. The coupled system was stable and efficient in long-term operation, and it was more efficient in energy recovery and wastewater treatment than the coupled dark fermentation and methanogenesis. This research showed the feasibility and effectiveness of utilizing the coupled system for continuous hydrogen and lipid production from waste substrates. More wastes could be used in large-scale reactors to further improve the efficiencies of the continuous coupled system."
