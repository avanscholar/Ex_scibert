0,Introduction,"With the rapid increasement of fossil fuel consumption and environmental issues, it is necessary to transform the energy carrier from non-renewable fossil fuels to sustainable and clean energy [ 1–4 ]. Hydrogen generation via water electrolysis is considered as an ideal approach for achieving sustainable and pollution-free society [ 5–7 ]. Research on effective catalysts to enhance the energy conversion efficiency of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has triggered extensive attentions [ 8,9 ]. Hitherto, platinum-based HER electrocatalysts are the best catalysts for their unrivaled catalytic activity and more negative d-band center, but the scarcity and exorbitant cost limit their large-scale industrial applications [ 10–14 ]. Thus, developing earth-abundant, highly active and low-cost alternatives is considered as a promising strategy to realize this hydrogen-based energy system. Among the explored candidates, tungsten carbide-based materials (WC, W2C, and WC1–x ), due to the similar d-band electronic structure to noble metal Pt, have attracted extensive interest [ 15–18 ]. Among them, W2C has been considered as the most promising catalyst for HER in the view of the theoretically predicted lower hydrogen adsorption free energy and higher electrical density of states around the Fermi level [ 19 ]. Recently, many studies have been concentrated on the nanostructural design of highly active W2C electrocatalyst to increase the density of exposed active centers on surfaces. An effective strategy to enhance HER activity is to design and construct various nanostructures, e.g. nanoparticles, nanodots and microspheres [ 20–23 ]. Another way is to introduce conductive supports for improving the electronic transportation capability of pristine W2C, e.g., carbon nanotubes (CNT) and carbon cloth (CC), Nickle Foam (NF) and W foil [ 24–28 ]. Although it has been shown that these strategies can effectively improve the electrocatalytic activity, the improvement is still marginal since the intrinsic activity of W2C cannot be able to effectively modulated by simply devising the structure. In order to further increase the catalytic activity, heteroatomic doping engineering has been considered as an important and effective strategy to modify the d-band electron structure of active W sites in W2C and therefore increase intrinsic activity of catalysts [ 29–32 ]. Phosphorus (P) emerges as a suitable option because when the P atom is embedded in the lattice of transition metals to form a metal-phosphorus bond, the negatively charged P can act as an acceptor to capture the positively charged proton during the reaction, accomplishing an intrinsically improved HER activity [ 33,34 ]. However, the previously reported strategy using the Polyoxometalates (POMs, H3PW12O40) results in the uncontrolled doping into W2C solids, leading to mass dead active sites due to quite low surface doping level [ 35 ]. The lack of such knowledge is hindering the functionalized design and controlled synthesis of highly active electrocatalysts based on the P-mounting W2C surface. Thus, it is necessary to construct W2C with controllable P-mounting surfaces to better understand the key effects of foreign atoms on the enhanced catalytic activity for further activation and optimization of hydrogen evolution. Herein, employing the phytic acid (PA) as the phosphorus source, the ultrafine W2C nanoislands (average size: 2.3 nm) with the tunable phosphorus-mounting surface monodispersed on N,P dual-doped carbon frameworks as a model system were prepared by a simply one-step carbonization of the mixed precursor (Scheme 1 ). Significantly, by facilely adjusting the concentration of P sources, the surface P-mounting level can be controlled accordingly. Moreover, we also found that the relatively high levels of P-mounting surface-to-volume ratio can significantly boost HER performance, and the excessive bulk P substituents would damage the W2C structure and reduce the electron transfer efficiency, leading to the decreasing intrinsic HER activity. DFT calculations further disclose that P mounting can efficiently improve the metallicity of W2C surface and surficial P amounting can remarkably facilitate the hydrogen release which is limiting the intrinsic activity of W2C surfaces. As a result, the optimized P-mounting W2C catalysts exhibit high HER activity and durability in both acid and alkaline solutions."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All chemical reagents in the present work were analytical grade and no further purification is required. Dicyandiamide (C2H4N4), ammonium metatungstate (NH4)6H2W12O40·xH2O), and phytic acid (C6H18O24P6, 70% in H2O) were purchased from Aladdin. Nafion solution (5 wt%) and Pt/C (20 wt% Pt on Vulcan XC-72R) were obtained from the DuPont (USA) and Johnson Matthey Company, respectively."
3,Preparation of electrocatalyst,"2.2 Preparation of electrocatalyst The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 4.0 g dicyandiamide (DCA, C2H4N4) and 0.5g ammonium metatungstate (AMT, (NH4)6H2W12O40·xH2O) in 100 mL DI water under continuous magnetic stirring at 80 °C. Later, a certain amount of phytic acid (PA, C6H18O24P6, 70% in H2O) was added into the above solution. Next, the solvent was completely removed at 120 °C and the white precursor was collected. After dried in a vacuum oven at 100 °C for 24 h, the precursors were firstly heated to 550 °C for 120 min. Then, it was further heated to 775 °C and kept in a continuously Ar gas for 5 h. All heating rates are 5 °C min−1. Last, the WCP catalysts were acquired as the tubular furnace naturally was cooled to normal temperature (25 °C). The as-prepared catalysts are denoted as WCP-1, WCP-2, and WCP-3, which are associated with the different amounts of phytic acid (50, 100, and 150 μL), respectively. The W2C was obtained to follow the same procedure without phytic acid."
4,Preparation of working electrodes,"2.3 Preparation of working electrodes Firstly, 5 mg of sample was diffused into a mixture solution of 80 μL Nafion membrane solution (5 wt%), 500 μL alcohol and 500 μL DI water to prepare the catalyst suspensions. Then, the suspension was subjected to ultrasonic treatment for at least 30 minutes to transform a uniform slurry. Afterward, 5 μL of the ink was drop-casted on the clean glassy carbon electrode (GCE) of 3 mm diameter. It is then air-dried at normal temperature. The catalyst mass loading of the working electrode was 0.34 mg cm−2."
5,Structural characterization,"2.4 Structural characterization The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken on the FEI Sirion 200 instrument equipped with EDX spectroscopy. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were captured using the Tecnai G2 F20 and the Mini Flex 600 system, respectively. Raman spectra and the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were collected using the instrument LabRAMHR-800 (632.81 nm) and the ESCALAB 250Xi (Al Kα source), respectively. The XPS was acquired to evaluate the valence states on the surface of the materials. All XPS spectra were fitted by C 1s (284.8 eV) to compensate for the charge effect."
6,Electrochemical measurement,"2.5 Electrochemical measurement The electrochemical characterizations were operated on the electrochemical workstation of CHI 660E at room temperature with a normal three-electrode system. The LSV curves were performed from 0.1 to –0.4 V with a scan rate of 2 mV s−1. The cycling stability test was investigated by conducting 1000 CV tests from 0.1 and –0.4 V using the scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Besides, the chronoamperometry was used to monitor the continuous hydrogen production stability for 10 h at a controlled potential corresponding to the specific current density (–10 mA cm−2). The EIS was acquired at a constant potential of –200 mV (frequency range: 106–1 Hz). All the reported potentials in the present work referred to the RHE (E vs. RHE = E vs. SCE + 0.241 + 0.059pH). All polarization curves were corrected by IR-compensation and all the reported current densities were derived from the geometric area (0.071 cm2) of the GCE."
7,Density functional theory calculations,"2.6 Density functional theory calculations Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted by using the VASP with the plane-wave technique [ 1,2 ], in which the ion-electron interaction was processed within the projector-augmented plane wave pseudopotentials [ 3,4 ]. The bulk and surface calculations were performed in Brillouin zone using 7×7×11 sampling and 3×3×1 k-points sampling, respectively. A cutoff of 450 eV was chosen for the plane wave basis set in all calculations. The convergence of energy was set to be 1×10−5 eV while the convergence of the forces was 0.01 eV Å−1. The (001) planes of W2C and WCP were composed of four atomic layers, of which the top two layers were used to simulate the surface of the W2C. The energy of adsorbed H (ΔGH*) is expressed as: ΔG H* = ΔE ZPE + ΔE H −TΔS where ΔE ZPE, ΔE H, ΔS and T are zero-point energy difference, hydrogen adsorption energy, entropy difference between gas phase and adsorption state, and T is the system temperature (300 K), respectively."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization of WCP,"3.1 Characterization of WCP The morphology and detailed structure of as-obtained W2C are revealed though the SEM and TEM. The SEM images (Fig. S1) show that all the W2C samples display almost the same morphologies with irregular shapes consisting of many interconnected small particles. In this work, all P-mounting W2C catalysts are defined as WCP-X, where X is associated with the increased amounts of phytic acid (1, 2, and 3 correspond to 50, 100, and 150 μL of PA, respectively). Taking WCP-2 as the representative sample due to its highest catalytic activity demonstrated later, it can be seen that numerous well-distributed W2C nanoislands with an ultrafine size of 2.3 nm (range 1–3 nm) are anchored on the distorted carbon matrix, as depicted in Figs. 1(a)–(c) . This anchoring structure with the loose carbon layers on W2C not only can prevent the overgrowing and aggregation of nanoislands but also can efficiently stabilize them without coking during the HER process. Simultaneously, the HRTEM image for the WCP-2 (Figs. 1(d1) and (d2)) demonstrates the lattice stripes with interlayer distances of 0.24 and 0.23 nm, which can be assigned to the (002) and (101) plane of W2C, respectively. But only a few lattice fringes can be found in WCP, indicating the low crystallinity probably originated from ultrafine nanocrystalline feature. In the meantime, the elements of W, C, P, and N are detected in the WCP sample by HAADF under the STEM model (Figs. 1(f)–(k)), indicating the W, C, P, and N are homogenous distributed through the whole structure. The XRD patterns of pure-phase W2C and WCP-2 are shown in Fig. 2(a) . Four diffraction peaks at 38.2°, 39.4°, 61.8°, and 74.9° can be indexed to the (002), (101), (110) and (112) crystal planes of W2C (PDF no. 35-0776), respectively. These broadened peaks can be attributed to the weakly crystallinity and ultra-small size of the synthesized W2C [ 36 ], which coincides with the TEM observations. Besides, the WCP-2 and pure-W2C present similar XRD patterns without peak shift, implying no structural deformation and therefore suggesting that moderate phosphorus-mounting cannot destroy the crystalline structure of W2C obviously. As shown in the Raman spectra (Fig. 2(b)), two peaks located at 1590 and 1340 cm−1 correspond to the G and D band of carbon frameworks, respectively, which are associated with the disordered carbon and graphitic carbon. The high intensity of D bands indicates that the carbon frameworks is relatively disordered and enrich with defects [ 37 ]. The surface valence state and chemical composition of the WCP-2 were further identified via the XPS. Fig. 2(c) displays W 4f high-resolution XPS spectrum, which can be fitted to four doublets. The predominant doublet at 31.6 and 33.7 eV are assigned to the W–C bonds [ 25,38 ], and the doublet at 32.0 and 34.1 eV are related to the W–P bonds [ 39 ]. While the two doublets at the higher binding energy of 32.6, 34.6 and 36.0, 38.1 eV corresponding to W4+ and W6+, which can be common in carbides/nitrides due to easy surface oxidation upon air exposure [ 22,40 ]. Fig. 2(d) depicts the visible peaks of C 1s, the fitting peaks at 286.4, 285.4, and 284.7 eV can be assigned to features of C–O, C–N/C–P, and C–C bonds [ 41,42 ], while the peak around 284.1 eV has been reported to represent C–W bond [ 43,44 ]. The N 1s can be deconvoluted into two peaks, pyridinic-N at 398.0 eV and graphitic-N at 401.4 eV [ 45 ]. The absence of W–N bond suggests that the N atoms were mainly doped in the carbon framework. As for the P 2p, it exhibits two types of phosphorus environments. Remarkably, besides the appearing P 2p peak associated with P-O (134.8) and P-C (133.5) [ 46–48 ], the doublet at 129.3 and 130.5 eV can be attributed to P–W bonds [ 39 ]. The strong P–W bonds indicate that the P atoms were dominantly mounting onto the W2C surfaces."
10,Electrocatalytic HER performance of catalysts,"3.2 Electrocatalytic HER performance of catalysts The electrocatalytic HER performance of W2C and WCP catalysts were evaluated in both acid and alkaline electrolytes under a conventional three-electrode system. The commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) was tested as a benchmarking catalyst, exhibiting the highest HER performance with a negligible onset potential (η 1, j = –1 mA cm−2) in both acidic and alkaline solution close to the results reported [ 49,50 ]. In 0.5 M H2SO4 (Fig. 3(a) ), the pristine W2C shows substantially worse HER activity, observed by a large onset overpotential of –156 mV (η 1, took at the current density of –1 mA cm−2) and a large representative overpotential (η 10) of –241 mV at the current density of –10 mA cm−2. Clearly, the WCP-2 displays the best HER activity among all W2C catalysts. It only demands the overpotential of –93 and –145 mV to present the current density of –1 and –10 mA cm−2, respectively. In addition to the acidic media, the WCP is further evaluated in alkaline solution (Fig. 3(d)). Impressively, WCP-2 displays a better HER performance with the η 1 of –61 mV and η 10 of –117 mV, which is significantly smaller than those of pure W2C (η 1 =– 115 mV and η 10 = –205 mV). In acidic solution (Fig. 3(b)), the WCP-2 catalyst shows the lowest Tafel slope of 52 mV dec−1, which is much smaller than that of W2C (82 mV dec−1), WCP-1 (70 mV dec−1), and WCP-3 (60 mV dec−1). Meanwhile, the WCP-2 catalyst also shows a remarkably decreased Tafel slope of 50 mV dec−1 in alkaline solution (Fig. 3(e)). The lower Tafel slope indicates a faster increment of hydrogen production rate with the enlarged overpotential. Besides, the Tafel plots can also give more insights into the mechanism and indicate the HER rate-limiting step. The values of the Tafel slopes are all between 40–120 mV dec−1, which suggests that the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism is responsible for HER and the Heyrovsky step (electrochemical desorption) is the rate-limiting step. The evaluation of the η 10 and Tafel slopes in Figs. 3(c) and (f) show that all WCP catalysts have more promising HER activity than the pristine W2C in both acidic and alkaline solution, which confirms the positive effect of phosphorus mounting on hydrogen evolution. While the HER performance of WCP-3 with more P level is not as good as the WCP-2, which indicates that the HER performance is sensitive to the P content, and excessive P substitution can destroy the structure and lead to a performance degradation. To value the stability of the WCP-2 catalyst, both the continuous CV scans and long-term electrolysis measurements were carried out. As compared to the related initial curves (Figs. 3(g) and (h), the negligible decrease of current density after 1000 CV cycles in both 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH demonstrate the good stability of WCP. The time-current density curves (–145 mV in acidic media (Fig. 3(g)), and –117 mV in alkaline media (Fig. 3(h))) show only a slight decline of current density for 10 h after continuous testing, which further confirms the good stability. In addition, after the stability tests, the crystal structure (Fig. S2) and TEM morphology (Fig. S3) of WCP were almost unchanged, which also confirmed significant catalytic durability. However, it is worth noting that the WO3 and P-O peaks in XPS (Fig. S4) increased after the stability tests (especially under acidic conditions), while the W-P peaks decreased after the stability tests, which indicates that the slight decline of performance during the HER process can be attributed to the partial oxidation of the W–P bond. The content of W, P, C, and N in the WCP-2 are also given in Fig. S5, it can be seen that the P content remains almost unchanged after the stability tests in acidic and alkaline solution. The HER reaction kinetics on the surface of the samples were further verified using the EIS measurements. As shown in Figs. 4(a) and (d) , the Nyquist plots of as-prepared samples show two semicircles, which can be fitted to a two-time-constant equivalent circuit. As a whole, the semicircle at the low-frequency region reflects the charge transfer process (R ct), whereas the other semicircle is related to the surface porosity (R p). Among all catalysts, the WCP-2 exhibits the smallest charge transfer impedance (R ct) of 26.3 and 25.8 Ω in acid and alkaline solution, respectively, which establishes the faster electron transfer efficiency and more favorable electrocatalytic kinetics. The electrochemically active surface areas (ECSA) of the W2C and WCP in acidic and basic media were also calculated by the double-layer capacitance (C dl, Figs. S6 and S7). One can see that the C dl values of WCP-2 reached 48.1 and 17.8 mF cm−2 in acidic and alkaline media, respectively, which are both much higher than that of W2C (20.2 mF cm−2 in acidic media, 13.0 mF cm−2 in alkaline media). Due to the ECSA is proportional to the magnitude of C dl, the WCP-2 exhibits the highest ECSA values of 1202.5 cm2 ECSA in acidic media and 445 cm2 ECSA in alkaline media, which implies the high phosphorus-mounting level on the surface can provide more HER active centers. Besides, the turnover frequency (TOF) values (computation details can be seen in Supporting Information and Fig. S4) were calculated to get insight into the intrinsic activities of as-prepared samples. As can be seen in Figs. 4(e) and (f), the TOF values at –200 mV of WCP-2 are 0.07 and 0.56 H2 s−1 per active site in H2SO4 and KOH media, respectively, which are several-fold higher than that of W2C (0.01 and 0.05 H2 s−1 in H2SO4 and KOH, respectively), indicating that the intrinsic activity of W2C has been greatly improved."
11,Mechanism understanding of P mounting,"3.3 Mechanism understanding of P mounting Although it can be concluded from the electrochemical analysis that the superior HER performance of the WCP samples mainly originates from the combined effect of faster electron transfer rate, the higher density of active sites, and better intrinsic activity, it is still unclear how the different P content on the W2C determines the HER activity. To further understand the effect of P mounting on the improved HER activity of W2C, the morphology and structure of the WCP with several P content are observed by SEM and XRD, respectively. As can be seen in Fig. S1, there is no obvious change in morphology for all WCP catalysts. As shown in XRD patterns (Fig. 5(a) ), there is a new diffraction peak of WCP-3 is observed at 31.1°, which can be indexed to WP (011) (JCPDS no. 29-1364), indicating the formation of WP. Meanwhile, the two peaks around 38°, 39° of W2C are merged into one peak, indicating the W2C structure is probably be damaged. The structure damage of the W2C may be the main cause of the deterioration in performance for WCP-3. The surface structures of all WCP catalysts are further studied by XPS (Fig. 5 and Fig. S9). As depicted in Fig. 5(b) and (c), both relative content of W-P species (Table S5) in W4f and P-W species in P 2p increase with the increase of phytic acid, revealing the composite of WCP can be well regulated. The oxidation peak (P-O) in P 2p spectra is present in all WCP catalysts, which means the P substitutions are responsive to oxidation in the air. But it became less obvious as the amount of phytic acid increased, suggesting that more P substitutions can stabilize the W–P bond and reduce the surface oxidation. The bulk and the surface atomic content of P are obtained by EDS (Fig. S10, Table S1) and XPS (Table S2), respectively [ 30,31 ]. Fig. 5(d) shows the P content of the bulk (EDS) and surface (XPS) in all WCP nanoparticles. It should be noted that the surfaces of both WCP-1 and WCP-2 have a higher P content, with surface-to-bulk P atomic ratios of 1.88 and 1.53, respectively (Table S3), whereas the WCP-3 show a very small surface-to-bulk P atomic ratio of 1.03. Therefore, it can be concluded that P mounting gradually penetrates from the surface to the inside as the P source increases. The formation process of WCP can be divided into two parts: the first is the formation of tungsten carbide; and the second is the process of replacing carbon atoms with phosphorus atoms. Obviously, when the amount of phosphorus sources is low, phosphorus substitution can only occur on the surface and it is difficult to penetrate into the W2C nanoparticles. When the addition amount of phosphorus sources is increased, the content of surface P substitutions also increases, and at the same time, the surface P substituents gradually diffuse into the interior of W2C to form bulk P substitutions. Moreover, the higher activity WCP-2 possesses a higher surface atomic content of P (5.15%) than WCP-1 (3.89%), implying the surface P-mounting plays a key role in enhancing the HER activity. Although WCP-3 has a similar surface atomic content of P (5.07%) with WCP-2, the excess internal P mounting damages the W2C structure leading to a slower electron transfer rate (Figs. 4(a) and (d)) which in turn inhibits the HER performance. Hence, we have clarified that the suitable surface P-mounting of WCP-2 allows it to keep the W2C structure unchanged while maximizing the surface P-mounting effect, thus exhibiting the best HER performance. The first-principle DFT calculations were further conducted to study the changes of electronic structures and Gibbs free energy of H adsorption (ΔG H*) on the surficial P mounting and solid P doping models. It can be found (Fig. 6(a) ) that electronic DOS of WCP near the Fermi level is larger than that of W2C, which means the P in W2C can enhance its metallicity. The higher metallicity will result in higher carrier density, which can greatly facilitate the charge transfer rate in electrochemical reaction process. The ΔG H* is considered as the major descriptor of merit to compare the intrinsic activities of catalysts, where the ΔG H* value closer to zero indicates the higher HER activity. The pure W2C with the largest ΔG H* (–0.78 eV) exhibits the strong hydrogen binding energy, which may hinder the H desorption step and lead to inferior HER activity. In contrast, after P replaces part of the C on the surface or bulk of W2C, the negative ΔG H* reduces close to zero, implying the weakening of adsorbed H. It is worth noting that the surface P-mounting W2C (s-WCP) shows a lower ΔG H* (–0.31 eV) than bulk P-mounting W2C (–0.40 eV), indicating that the surficial P-mounting plays a dominant role in improving the intrinsic activity compared with solid P doping."
12,Conclusions,"In summary, the tunable atomic P-mounting surfaces are purposely designed to optimize HER activity of W2C nanoislands via the simply one-step carbonization of the mixed precursors. It can be found that with the increase of P source, the P mounting gradually permeates from the surface to the bulk. Moreover, the proper level of surface P-mounting surface-to-volume ratio can enable the best surface mounting effect and is found to be the root cause of significantly improving intrinsic HER activity, while excessive bulk P substituents would damage of W2C structure and reduce the electron transfer efficiency, leading to the decline of performance. DFT calculations further reveal that the P substituents in W2C can enhance the surface metallicity and surface P mounting plays a leading role in improving the intrinsic activity. Thus, the optimal WCP with a moderate P-mounting surface-to-volume ratio of 1.53 displays the highest catalytic performance among all the studied samples in acidic and basic solutions, respectively. This study provides new insights into how the surface foreign atom-mounting influences the activity of an electrocatalyst, which can be appliable to the in-depth understanding of other catalysts and catalytic reactions."
