0,Introduction,"Olive mills, cheese factories and cow farms are agro-industries that represent a considerable share of the worldwide economy with particular interest focused in the Mediterranean region. These industries generate millions of tons of wastewaters and large amounts of by-products, which are in many cases totally unexploited and thus dangerous for the environment. More specifically, approximately 5.4×106 m3 of olive mill wastewater is produced annually worldwide (Basheer et al., 2007), while 180–190×106 tons per year of cheese whey are generated (Mollea et al., 2013) and 55×106 dry tons of animal manure are collected every year for subsequent disposal (Liao et al., 2006). The liquid by-product of olive oil production using the three-phase centrifugation process, i.e. olive mill wastewater (OMW), is recognized in the whole Mediterranean, Aegean and Marmara region as a severe environmental problem because of its high organic content and recalcitrance to biodegradation which is particularly due to the presence of phenolic compounds. The total concentration of phenols in OMW, which contribute to a high toxicity and antibacterial activity (Capasso et al., 1995) can reach up to 24g/L (Paraskeva and Diamadopoulos, 2006). Its chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD5) range from 25 to 220kgO2/L and 9 to 100kgO2/L respectively (Paraskeva and Diamadopoulos, 2006), contributing to a significantly high bioenergy content. On the other hand, nitrogen, which is one of the essential macronutrients required for anaerobic bioprocesses, is usually low in OMW. The carbon-to-nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio is around 100:1.77:0.94, respectively, for OMW. Cheese manufacturing industry generates large amounts of high strength wastewater, with associated high biological (BOD5) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Cheese whey (CW) is a by-product of cheese manufacturing which mainly contains a significant amount of carbohydrates (4–5%), mainly lactose (45–50g/L), proteins (6–8g/L), lipids (4–5g/L) and mineral salts (8–10% of dried extract); mineral salts include NaCl and KCl (>50%), calcium salts and others. CW also contains appreciable quantities of lactic (0.5g/L) and citric acid, non-protein nitrogen compounds and B-group vitamins (Venetsaneas et al., 2009). Despite the high carbohydrate content of CW which is suitable for biological processing, the anaerobic treatment of raw CW is quite problematic due to its low bicarbonate alkalinity (50meq/L), high COD concentration (up to 70gCOD/L) and tendency for rapid acidification (Mawson, 1994). Agricultural wastewaters, including liquid animal manure (LCM), are characterized by high organic content with high amounts of total solids, ammonia and pathogens (Rico et al., 2011). Insufficient or uncontrolled handling and disposal of such highly polluting agro-wastes encounter imminent danger to environment and thus to public health. Multiple waste streams of organic substrates can be anaerobically co-digested to generate a homogeneous mixture increasing both process and equipment performance. Co-digestion of different types of organic by-products such as agro-industrial wastewaters has been increasingly applied in order to enhance the biogas production and overcome a number of problems such as nutrient imbalance, rapid acidification and presence of inhibiting compounds, among other factors (Paraskeva and Diamadopoulos, 2006; Dareioti et al., 2009). Two-stage anaerobic digestion (AD) for integrated bio-hydrogen and bio-methane production from organic materials has been reported to promise higher process efficiency and energy recoveries as compared to traditional one-stage AD (Schievano et al., 2012). If correctly operated, the first stage of these systems can achieve several steps including hydrolysis, acidification, and hydrogen gas production. The performance of an acidogenic reactor is of paramount importance especially during the two-phase anaerobic stabilization of wastes, since the acid reactor should provide the most appropriate substrate for the subsequent methanogenic one. Since many different types of bacteria are involved in the fermentation of organic wastes, anaerobic acidification of agroindustrial wastes may produce volatile fatty acids (VFAs), alcohols, H2, CO2 and other intermediate products (i.e. lactic acid). For sustainable bio-hydrogen production the feedstock has to meet certain criteria. For example, carbohydrate-rich feed stocks produced from sustainable resources in large quantities are of paramount importance, since they can be easily fermented favoring thus energy recovery, require minimum pretreatment and are of low cost. Different substrates such as solid wastes and food industry wastewaters can be easily fermented to produce hydrogen (Kapdan and Kargi, 2006) although pure carbohydrates (e.g. glucose, sucrose) have been most commonly used (Wang and Wan, 2009). Enhancing biological production of hydrogen gas is of great interest nowadays, because it is a promising alternative to fossil fuels due to its clean and high-energy yield. However, very little information is available even on pilot-scale (Supplement Table 1) and practically none on full-scale. A pilot-scale study is critical to testify the productivity before a new biotechnological process is put into full-scale operation. In larger than lab-scale, the use of mixed microbial cultures is a cost-effective and promising approach to achieve bio-hydrogen production. Not only hydrogen gas itself is a beneficial energy source but also VFAs can be used further for methane production by methanogenesis. The reactions involved in bio-hydrogen production are rapid and can be effectively used for treating large quantities of organic wastes. The behavior of acidogens in a two-phase process plays a primary role in producing major substrates, such as short-chain organic acids and hydrogen. A series of operating parameters including pH, temperature and hydraulic retention time are known to influence the performance of fermentation and the formation of intermediate fermentative products such as hydrogen, organic acids and ammonia (Wang and Wan, 2009). Among these factors, pH has been found to be crucial to the distribution of acidogenic products (Ren et al., 1997). Although a substantial number of studies have been conducted on the optimal pH range for fermentative hydrogen production, the results are often inconsistent due to differences in substrate and seed type and other operating conditions adopted (Wu et al., 2010). Furthermore, many studies have been conducted to look into the effect of initial pH on fermentative hydrogen production, whereas the importance of pH control has rarely been investigated (Wang and Wan, 2009). It is acknowledged, for example, that low pH values result in inhibition of the hydrogenase activity, which is regarded to as a key factor explaining the influence of pH on fermentative hydrogen production (Khanal et al., 2004; Mohd Yasin et al., 2011). The metabolic pathways involving acetic and butyric acid production appear to be favored at pH ranging from 4.5 to 6.0, while neutral or higher pH are believed to promote ethanol and propionate production (Guo et al., 2010). Meanwhile, the reported optimal pH values for different substrates differed substantially from 4.0 to 6.5, but for each specific situation, the optimal pH range was quite narrow (usually within 0.5). For instance, an optimal pH value of 6.0 was obtained using cheese whey (Ferchichi et al., 2005), food wastes (Jiang et al., 2013) and kitchen wastes (Zhang et al., 2013), a lower pH value of 5.5 was considered as optimum using glucose (Fang and Liu, 2002), whereas the initial pH of 4.5 gave the highest specific hydrogen production potential when sucrose and starch was used as substrate (Khanal et al., 2004). In the present study, the effect of pH on hydrogen production and acidogenesis of a waste mixture of olive mill wastewater, cheese whey and liquid cow manure was investigated. Our purpose was to determine experimentally the optimum pH value and identify the main metabolic pathways followed for both hydrogen and volatile fatty acids production in the acidogenic reactor of a two-stage anaerobic co-digestion system. The pH values tested ranged from 4.5 to 7.5 with 0.5 increment and were maintained constant throughout the process. The anaerobic co-digestion of the same mixture of agro-wastes in a two-stage system has been previously studied by the authors (Dareioti et al., 2009) in order to prove the feasibility of the process under sub-optimal conditions."
1,Methods,
2,Anaerobic sludge,"2.1 Anaerobic sludge For all experiments carried out in this study an acclimatized anaerobic inoculum was used, which was obtained from an anaerobic acidogenic CSTR digester with a working volume of 750mL. The digester was fed daily with the same mixture of OMW, CW and LCM (with a ratio of 55% OMW, 40% CW and 5% LCM (v/v/v)) and operated at steady-state conditions at hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3days and organic loading rate (OLR) of 16kgVS/m3 d under mesophilic conditions (37°C). Prior to culture use in batch experiments the anaerobic sludge was centrifuged (4500rpm) to remove the soluble part of the culture medium."
3,Substrate,"2.2 Substrate The raw agro-wastes used in this study included OMW, CW and LCM. All three wastes were collected from small local units in the area of Patras (Western Greece). In particular, OMW was obtained from a local olive oil-mill using a three-phase centrifugation decanter, CW was provided from a cheese factory located in the same region producing mainly the white cheese “feta”, while LCM was collected from a dairy farm breeding 230 cows. All wastewaters were collected fresh and stored immediately after sampling in the freezer at −18°C until subsequent use throughout the experimentation period. The tested mixture of wastes consisted of 55% OMW, 40% CW and 5% LCM (v/v/v) because of its efficiency for biogas production as has been demonstrated by the authors in a previous study (Dareioti et al., 2009)."
4,Batch fermentation,"2.3 Batch fermentation Anaerobic batch experiments were performed to study the acidogenesis of an agro-industrial waste mixture of OMW, CW and LCM (in a ratio of 55% OMW, 40% CW and 5% LCM (v/v/v)) at different constant pH values in the range of 4.5 to 7.5 with 0.5 increment. All experiments were conducted in a 1-L fermentor under controlled temperature and stirring rate conditions. The temperature was kept constant at 37°C (mesophilic conditions) via a thermocouple controller and stirring rate was set at 150rpm ensuring homogeneous mixing and facilitating rapid diffusion of the produced hydrogen by a geared motor drive unit installed on the top of the fermentor. The working volume of the fermentor was adjusted to 400mL. The amount of anaerobic sludge used as inoculum was 60mL (15%v/v of working volume), while the remaining consisted of the tested waste mixture. The pH of the mixed liquor was kept constant throughout the course of the experiment via automatic control (using a HACH PID-controller) by adding NaOH or HCl solution (6N) via respective peristaltic pumps. Prior to each fermentation nitrogen gas was purged for 20min with flow rate of 2L/min to ensure anaerobic conditions."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Physicochemical characterization was performed in all raw agro-wastes and fermented effluents (fermentation end-products). The off-line pH measurements were carried out using an electrode (Orion 3-Star), while TSS, VSS, TS, VS, total and soluble COD, BOD5, TKN, ammonium nitrogen, total and ortho – phosphates, oil and fats and alkalinity were determined according to Standard Methods, as described in detail by Dareioti et al. (2009). For the measurement of TSS and soluble compounds (soluble organic carbon, lactic acid, VFAs, etc.), the insoluble residue was separated from the supernatant via Whatman® glass microfiber filters, Grade GF/F. For the determination of total and soluble carbohydrates, a colored sugar derivative was produced through the addition of l-tryptophan, sulfuric and boric acid, which was subsequently measured colorimetrically at 520nm, whereas dissolved phenolic compounds were determined spectrophotometrically according to the Folin–Ciocalteu method (Dareioti et al., 2009). Total and soluble organic carbon (TOC and SOC) were analyzed with a Carbon TOC-V analyzer (Shimadzu). Lactic acid in the culture medium was measured with a DIONEX IC300 ion chromatography system using a thermostated (30°C) Dionex IonPac analytical column (AS19 length 4×250mm and 7.5mm I.D) and a guard column (4×50mm length and 12mm I.D) and an electron conductivity detector (Dionex). Composition analysis of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), ethanol and produced biogas was performed in a gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies 7890A). For quantification of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and ethanol a gas chromatograph equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) was used, using helium as carrier gas. A capillary column (DB–FFAP, 30m in length, 0.25mm I.D. and 0.25μm film) was used for determining the concentration of the individual VFAs and ethanol. The produced biogas was measured by automatic tailor-made devices comprising of a combination of an engine oil filled U-tube, an electron–valve and a counter. The measurement was based on counting the number of displacements of constant oil volume by the produced biogas in each biogas line. Biogas composition (hydrogen and carbon dioxide) was analyzed by gas chromatography using a capillary column (HP-PLOT/Q, 30m in length, 0.53mm I.D. and 40μm packing film), a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and nitrogen as carrier gas. The total biogas and hydrogen volume, produced during each experiment, were converted at standard temperature and pressure conditions (i.e. STP=0°C and 1atm)."
6,Bacterial growth model,"2.5 Bacterial growth model The cumulative bio-hydrogen production profile from each batch experiment was fitted to a modified Gompertz bacterial growth model (Eq. (1)) using OriginPro version 8. This equation has been widely used to model gas production data (Mohd Yasin et al., 2011). (1) H = P exp - exp R m e p ( λ - t ) + 1 where H is the cumulative hydrogen production (mL); P is the maximum hydrogen production potential (mL); Rm is the maximum hydrogen production rate (mL/h); λ is the lag-phase duration (h); t is the time (h) and e is exp(1)=2.71828. The specific hydrogen production potential (SHPP) was obtained by dividing P with the substrate COD applied (Khanal et al., 2004). The maximum specific hydrogen production rate (SHPR m ) was determined by dividing Rm by the volatile suspended solids (VSS) added. The hydrogen conversion efficiency for different pH values was compared based on SHPP and SHPR m ."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Wastewaters characterization,"3.1 Wastewaters characterization After homogenization of the waste mixture used in each batch test, duplicate samples were received and measured. Throughout the experimentation period samples were also taken periodically and measured in duplicate from the separate waste streams (OMW, CW, LCM), in order to verify their integrity and constant characteristics. Table 1 summarizes the average characteristics measured for each one of the separate waste streams and the mixture used in this study. All of them are characterized by high organic content. In particular, the high organic load contained in cheese whey (75gCOD/L) is mainly due to carbohydrates (lactose). The olive mill wastewater contained more oil and fats (12.76±1.31g/L) and phenols (6.60g/L) compared with the others. The liquid cow manure was characterized by high concentration of total volatile fatty acids (7241.84±19.61mg/L) and nitrogen (3.36gTKN/L)."
9,Effect of pH,"3.2 Effect of pH Batch experiments were carried out using a mixture of agro-industrial wastewaters at a ratio of 55% OMW, 40% CW and 5% LCM in order to assess the effect of pH on hydrogen production and distribution of products. The pH values tested were 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0 and 7.5. The quantity of produced biogas and its composition was monitored throughout the course of each experiment. At regular intervals samples were collected for analysis, i.e. determination of carbohydrates, VFAs, alcohols, lactic acid, phenol, TS, VS, TOC and SOC. Fig. 1 illustrates the quantity of biogas and hydrogen produced at STP conditions, the total sugar consumption and the main metabolic end-products, as function of pH. In all pH values tested, the biogas was mainly composed of hydrogen and carbon dioxide, whereas the mixed liquor was composed of VFA, lactic acid and ethanol. As shown in Fig. 1(a) the biogas and hydrogen production were pH dependent. The maximum production of hydrogen (603.7mL) was obtained at pH 6.0, whereas lowering the pH value below 5.0 resulted to almost negligible hydrogen productivity. During all fermentation experiments, no methane production was detected indicating that only acidogenesis was active, even though some of the adopted pH conditions (higher than pH 7.0) may have been suitable for methanogenesis. The consumption of total carbohydrates, measured as equivalent glucose, (Fig. 1(b)) was high in all tested pH values with the maximum degradation (85.4%) observed at pH 6.0. Similarly, soluble carbohydrates consumption was even higher (94.5%) at pH 6.0 despite their simultaneous production due to hydrolysis of total carbohydrates. Ferchichi et al. (2005) observed equally high sugar consumption (97%) studying hydrogen production from cheese whey at different initial pH values ranging from 5.0 to 9.0, suggesting that the microorganisms’ ability to consume sugars did not alter within this initial pH range. Degradation of glucose under anaerobic conditions is accompanied by production of hydrogen and various metabolic products, mainly volatile fatty acids (i.e. acetic, propionic, and butyric acids), lactic acid and alcohols (ethanol), depending on the microbial species present and the prevailing conditions. The analysis of metabolic products provides useful information on the evolution of the process and can be used to explain the observed hydrogen generation yields. In the present study, the course of soluble metabolites’ concentration was monitored during the process. A mixture of acetic, propionic, butyric and lactic acid was measured as abundant metabolites which are characteristic of clostridia fermentation. The highest total VFAs concentration was detected at pH 6.5 (13.43g/L) but this was due to the concentration of propionic acid (Fig. 1(c)), which was observed to increase with increasing pH (from 0.09 to 4.02g/L), whereas concentrations of acetic and butyric acid were practically the same in both pH values of 6.0 and 6.5 (1.1g/L and 8.6g/L, respectively). Horiuchi et al. (2002) also studied the effect of changes in operating pH (ranging from 5.0 to 8.0) on organic acid production in continuous reactors. Their reactors were inoculated with anaerobic digester sludge and fed with a glucose–yeast extract medium. A switch from butyric acid to propionic acid production, as the pH increased, was attributed to a change in the dominant microbial population during the transition period of around 120h, rather than a metabolic pathway change within the same bacterial population, which would be expected to occur more quickly. It was previously reported by Zhang et al. (2013) that acetic acid was main product at pH 5.0 whereas butyric acid was dominant at pH 6.0, during anaerobic acidogenesis of kitchen wastes. In our experiments (Fig. 1(c)), ethanol concentration was higher (1230mg/L) at the lowest value of pH (pH 4.5) which is in agreement with the study of Ren et al. (1997) that suggested a pH value of about 4.5 as optimum for maximizing the production of ethanol. Besides ethanol, limited amounts (<400mg/L) of other volatile fatty acids (i.e. i-butyric, valeric, i-valeric and caproic) were detected in all pH values tested in this study. Table 2 presents additional results, including organic carbon, phenols and solids’ degradation, obtained during the tests carried out in this work. Apart from the highest carbohydrates’ degradation, the maximum removal of total and soluble organic carbon (i.e. 21% and 38%, respectively) and total and volatile solids (i.e. 22% and 40%, respectively) occurred at pH 6.0. Similarly, Zhang et al. (2013) observed also the greatest degree of hydrolysis and acidogenesis accompanied with the maximum VFA concentration when the pH value was controlled at 6.0. However, negligible phenolics’ depletion was observed at pH values lower than 6.0 (Table 2), whereas an increase in their degradation was observed as pH value increased (29.03% degradation at pH 7.5). Fig. 2 presents the acidogenenic experiment of the mixture at pH 6.0. In particular, the consumption of total and soluble sugars is associated with the rate of production of major products during the whole experimention course. The degradation of carbohydrates (Fig. 2(a)) contributed to an increase of the concentration of acetic acid, lactic acid and ethanol (Fig. 2(b)). Significant accumulation of butyric acid (approximately 9gbutyric acid/L) was observed after a period of 40h, mainly as a result of lactic acid degradation, which was also accompanied by simultaneous decrease in acetic acid and production of hydrogen. Furthermore, propionic acid was found to be produced in appreciable amounts only at later fermentation stages (i.e., when lactic acid depletion was observed). Matsumoto and Nishimura (2007) found that a mixed substrate of acetic and lactic acid enhanced hydrogen production by strain Clostridium diolis JPCC H-3. It was also observed that 1mol of acetic acid reacted with 2mol of lactic acid and produced 1mol of H2, 2mol of CO2, and 1.5mol of butyric acid. Fig. 3 (a) depicts the hydrogen yield (moles of hydrogen produced per mole equivalent glucose of total consumed carbohydrates) at each pH value tested. The maximum hydrogen yield was observed at pH 6.0 and was equal to 0.642molH2/molequivalent glucose consumed. According to literature, the optimum hydrogen yield should be achieved with acetic acid as the fermentation end-product (theoretical yield of 4mol of H2/mol of glucose). However, in our case no hydrogen seemed to be produced along with acetic acid in pH 6.0 (Fig. 2(b and c)), whereas hydrogen productivity seemed to be closely related to butyric acid production and lactic acid degradation. We consider that hydrogen production decrease in both lower and higher pH values than 6.0 is mainly due to enzymatic inhibition and not simultaneous consumption of produced hydrogen, since no methane was detected in all experiments (even at pH higher than 7.0). In addition, the yield of TVFAs is also a good indicator for pH optimization. As shown in Fig. 3(b) the greatest TVFAs yield was 0.417g carbon in TVFAs/g carbon in substrate (0.264g carbon in TVFAs/gVSfed) at pH 6.0 compared with 0.05 and 0.228g carbon in TVFAs/g carbon in substrate at pH values of 4.5 and 7.5, respectively. Pham et al. (2013) observed a maximal TVFAs yield of 0.371g carbon in TVFAs/g carbon in substrate at 6.2galginate/L and initial pH 7.6. Moreover, Jiang et al. (2013) emphasized that TVFAs yield is very important, as it shows how much substrate is converted into VFAs and observed the optimum pH of 6.0 with highest TVFAs yield of 0.316gTVFAs/g VSfed, the highest among all pH conditions tested (5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and uncontrolled pH). Our results indicate that pH is a very important factor because of the limitation of hydrogen production outside a narrow pH range. Anaerobic fermentation of food waste at thermophilic conditions was suitable for bio-hydrogen production at controlled pH 5.5 with a yield of 79mmolH2/L-medium/d (Mohd Yasin et al., 2011). In the latter case, total bacteria quantification analysis was carried out at different pH values (5.0, 5.5 and 6.0) and showed that 92% of the total bacteria belonged to Clostridium sp. at controlled pH 5.5. A range of optimum pH values has been reported in the literature for fermentation of carbohydrates by mixed bacterial cultures. Van Ginkel et al. (2001), for example, studied the effect of varying pH (4.5–7.5) and demonstrated that the highest hydrogen production rate (74.7mLH2/(Lh)) occurred at pH 5.5 and substrate concentration of 7.5gCOD/L. Another study using glucose at similar range of pH values from 4.0 to 7.0 has been presented by Fang and Liu (2002) who suggested that the maximum yield of 2.1±0.1molH2/mol glucose was observed at pH 5.5. Davila-Vazquez et al. (2008) studied the effect of the initial pH (3.88–8.12) using glucose, lactose and cheese whey powder as substrates, with the highest hydrogen yield being observed from glucose and lactose at an initial pH 7.5 and from cheese whey powder at an initial pH value of 6.0. It should also be noted that a comparison of the pH effects on hydrogen production reported in the present study and those documented in the literature is complicated by the fact that most of the latter report the results of runs where only the initial pH was adjusted (Ferchichi et al., 2005; Davila-Vazquez et al., 2008) without any further control along the process. In addition, we believe that the pH value during the process is very crucial for the main metabolic products evolution."
10,Kinetic analysis,"3.3 Kinetic analysis Lactic acid was identified as a major intermediate soluble product in all fermentation batches since it was firstly produced and subsequently metabolized during the process at a greater or lower extent depending on the applied pH. For example, in pH 6.0, lactic acid after exhibiting an intense accumulation phase for about 34h started to degrade until it was slightly detected at the end of the batch test (Fig. 2(b)). More specifically, accumulation of lactic acid was observed at both low and high pH values due to kinetic limitation in the reactions converting lactic acid to butyric acid and hydrogen. Lactic acid bacteria, including species of the Lactobacillus genus, are naturally found in CW as a result of the cheese making process. Lactobacilli produce lactic acid as the major fermentation product from sugars (Stiles and Holzapfel, 1997). They belong to the Firmicutes phylum of bacteria and have a high acid tolerance, surviving pH values of 5.0 and lower. According to Castelló et al. (2009), Lactobacilli are capable of producing lactic acid from lactose via three metabolic pathways, i.e. the homofermentative (Eq. (2)), the heterofermentative (Eq. (3)) and the bifidum pathway (Eq. (4)): Homofermentative pathway (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 2 CH 3 CH ( OH ) COOH Heterofermentative pathway (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 → CH 3 CH ( OH ) COOH + CH 3 CH 2 OH + CO 2 Bifidum pathway (4) 2 C 6 H 12 O 6 → 3 CH 3 COOH + 2 CH 3 CH ( OH ) COOH In addition, ethanol can be produced due to alcoholic fermentation (Eq. (5)): Ethanol production (5) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 2 CH 3 CH 2 OH + 2 CO 2 In general, hydrogen yields vary proportionally to the final metabolic products. Lactic acid and ethanol production are not accompanied by hydrogen generation (Antonopoulou et al., 2008). However, it is well-known that production of acetic and butyric acid favors the production of hydrogen with the fermentation of glucose to acetic acid giving the highest theoretical yield of 4mol of H2/mol of glucose (Eq. (6)) and the conversion to butyric acid resulting in 2mol of H2/mol of glucose (Eq. (7)): (6) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 (7) C 6 H 12 O 6 → CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2 On the other hand, the production of other metabolic products is accompanied by negative or zero hydrogen yield which results in lower overall hydrogen yield (molH2/mol sugars consumed). Vavilin et al. (1995), for example, gave the overall equation for the production of propionic acid from glucose, showing that this involves the consumption of hydrogen (Eq. (8)) implicating that the production of propionic acid should be avoided. Vavilin et al. (1995) stated also that the limiting substrate for butyric acid production is glucose, whereas for propionic acid production is hydrogen. (8) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 → 2 CH 3 CH 2 COOH + 2 H 2 O However, the transformation of lactic acid into propionic and acetic acid may occur with no hydrogen production. Clostridium propionicum is one of the species having such an ability following the reaction shown in Eq. (9) (Baghchehsaraee et al., 2009). In such a case, glucose can be firstly converted to lactic acid and finally to propionic and acetic acid, following various alternative pathways without producing any hydrogen. (9) 3 CH 3 CH ( OH ) COOH → 2 CH 3 CH 2 COOH + CH 3 COOH + CO 2 Alternatively, lactic acid may also decompose to butyric acid with simultaneous hydrogen production (Eq. (10); Alais, 1984). (10) 2 CH 3 CH ( OH ) COOH → CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2 Sträuber et al. (2012) reported a direct correlation of lactic acid degradation and butyric acid production during the steps of hydrolysis and acidogenesis using maize silage as a model substrate. The intense hydrogen production phase they observed was mainly associated with the production of butyric acid and the main gaseous products that evolved were hydrogen and carbon dioxide which are in agreement with Eq. (10). Baghchehsaraee et al. (2009) reported that when lactic acid was used as a sole substrate for hydrogen production, propionic and acetic acid was produced. More hydrogen was produced using a mixed substrate with starch and lactic acid, whereas the latter consumed resulted in increased butyric acid. According to Bhat and Barker (1947), butyric acid may be also formed by a condensation of two moles of acetic acid with two moles of hydrogen (Eq. (11)). (11) 2 CH 3 COOH + 2 H 2 → CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 2 H 2 O Taking into account the aforementioned transformation pathways (Eqs. (2), (3), (4), (9), (10), and (11)), our experimental data obtained at the optimum pH (6.0) were used to calculate mass balances in order to estimate the pathways that result to hydrogen production under these conditions (Table 3 ). The main calculations were carried out after the peak detection of lactic acid (34th h) and during its further consumption with simultaneous hydrogen production. Because of the complexity of microbial populations present in the mixed culture used in our experiment, a combination of fermentative pathways was assumed to take place initially converting glucose to lactic acid, acetic acid and ethanol (Eqs. (2)–(5)) during the lactic acid accumulation phase (0–34h). The contribution of each pathway (Eqs. (2)–(5)) to the production of intermediates was impossible to be clarified at this point. Therefore, the continued degradation of carbohydrates after the 34th h till the end of experiment was utilized to estimate proportionally the extra lactic and acetic acid production assuming that reactions Eqs. (2)–(4)were still functional and that the overall lactic and acetic acid production yields remained constant throughout the experimental test (Table 3, React. (1)). The propionic acid formation was attributed to lactic acid degradation with simultaneous acetic acid production, according to Eq. (9) (Table 3, React. (2)). The rest of lactic acid was decomposed to butyric acid as well as hydrogen and carbon dioxide, according to Eq. (10) (Table 3, React. (3)). However, a significant experimental observation was that the butyric acid mass produced was higher than the mass calculated to be produced from lactic acid degradation. Moreover, a decrease in the acetic acid mass was observed even though it was produced simultaneously with propionic acid (Eq. (9)). As a result, an additional calculation was done, assuming that acetate depletion goes along with the corresponding hydrogen towards butyric acid production (Table 3, React. (4)). As shown in Table 3 (React. (3)), hydrogen production is associated exclusively with butyric acid production whereas the molar ratio of hydrogen/butyric acid was estimated to be 0.944 (mol/mol). According to Table 3 a slight absolute error of 5.7% was calculated in the mass balances of acetic acid and hydrogen which however can be partially attributed to experimental errors and also to biomass production which was not encountered in all calculations presented in Table 3. Taking into account the low biomass productivity expected under anaerobic conditions we consider that the postulated reaction pathway presented in Table 3 can sufficiently describe hydrogen and VFAs productivity under the optimum conditions of pH 6.0. Based on these calculations and assumptions, i.e. hydrogen production is associated exclusively with butyric acid production, a correlation diagram was constructed using the hydrogen and butyric acid production from all batch tests (Fig. 4 ). A well-correlated relationship between hydrogen and butyric acid production was realized which can be attributed to Reactions (3,4) (Table 3). As shown in Fig. 4, hydrogen production appears to be proportional with butyric acid production by a factor of 0.914 (r 2 =0.987). At low pH values 4.5 and 5.0 hydrogen productivity was negligible due to lactic acid kinetic limitation, whereas the fermentation at high pH (7.5) presented a different transformation pathway, compared with the other pH tests, with the highest ratio of hydrogen/butyric acid of 2.03, which indicates the dominance of Reaction (3) against Reaction (4) (Table 3). Fig. 5 (a) depicts the hydrogen production based on our experimental data and the simulations generated using the fitted modified Gompertz model. The correlation coefficient (r 2) ranged between 0.870 and 0.999. Comparing each set of experimental data with the relevant model simulation, the parameters of hydrogen production potential (P), the maximum hydrogen production rate (Rm ), and lag-phase time (λ) were determined (Table 4 ). The P values increased as pH increased from 4.5 to 6.0, whereas Rm values increased as pH increased from 4.5 to 5.5. The P and Rm values peaked at pH of 6.0 and 5.5 respectively and decreased as pH increased to 7.5. The optimal pH for hydrogen production was found to be in the range of 6.0. This is in close agreement with a previous study by Lin et al. (2011) where pH 6.0 was deemed as the optimum initial pH for hydrogen production. The bioreactor with pH 5.5 had the longest lag time of 91.46h. The lag-phase decreased when pH increased from 5.5 to 7.5, whereas at pH values of 4.5 and 5.0 the lag-phase was not measurable due to the limited hydrogen productivity. Fig. 5(b) and (c) present the variation in SHPP and SHPR m along with operating pH values, respectively. The SHPP peaked at 15.11mLH2/gCOD demonstrating a clear optimum at pH6.0. However, the peak value of SHPR m was 2.88mLH2/gVSS-h at pH 5.5."
11,Conclusions,"In this study, bio-hydrogen was efficiently produced and maximized by properly adjusting the operating pH during the acidogenesis stage of OMW, CW and LCM co-digestion with a ratio of 55:40:5 (v/v/v). The maximum TVFAs yield and hydrogen productivity was observed at pH 6.0 with a hydrogen yield of 0.642molH2/mol equivalent glucose consumed. Hydrogen production was correlated to the evolution of butyric acid with a molar ratio of 0.91 (moles of hydrogen/mole of butyric acid) at all pH values tested except in pH 7.5 at which the highest ratio (2.03) was observed."
