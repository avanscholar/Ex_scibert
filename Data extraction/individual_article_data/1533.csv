0,Introduction,"Cyclohexylamine (CHA) is used as a raw material for metal corrosion inhibitors, rubber vulcanization accelerators, synthetic dyes, artificial sweeteners, plasticizers, surfactants and agricultural chemicals [1,2]. Cyclohexylamine is industrially produced by catalytic hydrogenation of aniline (AN) or amine alkylation of cyclohexanol with ammonia (NH3) [3–5]. However, these production methods require (1) high temperature and high pressure conditions, (2) excess amounts of hydrogen (H2) gas and (3) a large amount of NH3 to prevent side reactions. From the viewpoint of sustainable chemistry, it is necessary to develop a reaction system for hydrogenation of AN to CHA under mild conditions. A photocatalytic reaction can use solar light as an energy source for driving the reaction, which is consistent with the concept of sustainable chemistry. Titanium(IV) oxide (TiO2) is one of the most widely used photocatalysts. When TiO2 is irradiated with ultraviolet light, electrons (e−) are excited from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) and holes (h+) are generated in the VB. These cause reduction and oxidation reactions, respectively. When metal nanoparticles are supported on TiO2, they function as a co-catalyst, not only suppressing recombination of e− and h+ but also exhibiting specific reduction activity for various compounds. We have reported various photocatalytic reduction reactions over TiO2 modified with metals such as silver, copper, platinum, rhodium and palladium [6–10]. Among the various reduction reactions, ring hydrogenation of aromatic compounds is attractive research field in recent years from the viewpoint of hydrogen storage as well as utilization for organic synthesis materials [11–13]. It is known that a bimetal catalyst having two different elements exhibits an activity in a (thermo)catalytic reaction that is not achieved in a single metal system [14–16]. Therefore, it is expected that the same effect can also be obtained in a photocatalytic reaction system. In this study, we examined the effect of ruthenium (Ru) as a second element on the catalytic performance of metal-loaded TiO2 (M-TiO2) in ring hydrogenation of AN to CHA. Here we report (1) preparation and characterization of M-TiO2 and Ru/M-TiO2, (2) photocatalytic performance of M-TiO2 and Ru/M-TiO2, (3) effect of the reaction conditions on ring hydrogenation and (4) results of physicochemical studies on ring hydrogenation."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of M-TiO2,"2.1 Preparation of M-TiO2 Loading various metals (Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Rh, Pd and Ru) as co-catalysts on TiO2 (P25, Degussa) was performed by the photodeposition method. TiO2 powder was suspended in an aqueous methanol (MeOH) solution (50 vol%) containing a X mol% of the metal source (HAuCl4, AgNO3, CuCl2, H2PtCl6, PdCl2, RhCl3 and RuCl3) in a test tube. The test tube was sealed with a rubber septum under argon (Ar) and then photoirradiated for 2 h at λ > 300 nm by a 400 W high-pressure mercury arc (Eiko-sha, Osaka, Japan) with magnetic stirring in a water bath continuously kept at 293 K. The resulting powder was washed repeatedly with distilled water and dried for 2 h in vacuo. The obtained sample is hereafter designated as M(X)-TiO2."
3,Introduction of Ru to M-TiO2 (Ru/M-TiO2),"2.2 Introduction of Ru to M-TiO2 (Ru/M-TiO2) A two-step photodeposition method [17–20] was used for the preparation of Ru/M-TiO2. The prepared M(X)/TiO2 powder was suspended in an aqueous isopropyl alcohol (IPA) solution (50 vol%) containing a Y mol% of RuCl3 and hydrochloric acid (HCl) in a test tube. The test tube was sealed with a rubber septum under Ar and then photoirradiated for 6 h under the same condition. Since the rate of photodeposition in the aqueous IPA solution was smaller than that of photodeposition in the aqueous methanol solution, time of photoirradiation was prolonged to 6 h. The small photodeposition rate may be the reason for success in the selective formation of Ru layer on M-TiO2. The resulting powder was washed repeatedly with distilled water and dried for 2 h in vacuo. The obtained bimetallic sample is hereafter designated as Ru(Y)/M(X)-TiO2."
4,"Characterization of Pd-TiO2, Ru-TiO2 and Ru/Pd-TiO2","2.3 Characterization of Pd-TiO2, Ru-TiO2 and Ru/Pd-TiO2 Morphology of the photocatalysts was observed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL, Tokyo) operated at 200 kV in the Joint Research Center at Kindai University (JRC). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was acquired using an AXIS-NOVA ESCA (Shimadzu, Kyoto) in the JRC. The spectrum was calibrated by the peak that can be assigned to C 1s and was normalized."
5,Photocatalytic ring hydrogenation of AN,"2.4 Photocatalytic ring hydrogenation of AN In a typical run, M-TiO2 (or Ru/M-TiO2, 50 mg) was suspended in 5 cm3 of water containing AN (ca. 50 μmol) and oxalic acid (OA) used as a hole scavenger in a test tube, which was sealed with a rubber septum under Ar and then photoirradiated at λ > 300 nm with a 400 W high-pressure mercury arc in a water bath with stirring at a temperature of 293 K. The amounts of AN and products (CHA and cyclohexanone (CHON) were only produced under the conditions.) were determined with an FID-type gas chromatograph (GC-2025, Shimadzu) equipped with a DB-1 column. Toluene was used as an internal standard sample. The reaction solution (2 cm3) was added to diethyl ether (2 cm3) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution (1 cm3). After the mixture had been stirred for 10 min, AN, CHA and CHON in the ether layer were analyzed. The amounts of AN, CHA and CHON were determined from the ratios of their peak areas to the peak area of toluene. The amounts of H2 as the reduction product of protons (H+) and carbon dioxide (CO2) as the oxidation product of OA were determined using two TCD-type gas chromatographs (GC-8A, Shimadzu) equipped with MS-5A and Porapac Q-S columns, respectively."
6,Adsorption experiment,"2.5 Adsorption experiment M-TiO2 (or Ru/M-TiO2, 100 mg) was suspended in 5 cm3 of water containing AN or CHA (ca. 50 μmol) and OA (ca. 900 μmol) in a test tube, which was sealed with a rubber septum under Ar and then the mixture was stirred at a temperature of 293 K for 20 h in a dark place. The amounts of AN and CHA were determined in the same way as that for the photocatalytic reaction (Section 2.4)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Effect of metal co-catalyst on ring hydrogenation of AN,"3.1 Effect of metal co-catalyst on ring hydrogenation of AN Fig. 1 shows the results of photocatalytic reactions of AN in aqueous suspensions of M(3.5)-TiO2 for 30 min. When bare TiO2 was used as the photocatalyst, CHA and CHON were not formed and the color of TiO2 changed from white to blue just after photoirradiation, indicating that the tetravalent titanium in TiO2 was reduced to trivalent titanium by photogenerated electrons. When Au, Ag, Cu, and Ru were used as co-catalysts, CHA and CHON were not formed probably due to their large activation energies for the reactions. On the other hand, Pd(3.5)-TiO2 produced CHON with a small amount of CHA. This result means that hydrogenation of the benzene ring and elimination of ammonia occurred over the Pd co-catalyst. The reaction mechanism will be discussed later. In contrast to Pd(3.5)-TiO2, Rh(3.5)-TiO2 and Pt(3.5)-TiO2 produced a large amount of CHA with suppressed formation of CHON. These results indicate that selectivity in the photocatalytic reaction of AN is dependent of the type of co-catalyst. Fig. 2 shows the effect of introduction of Ru (1.0 mol%) as the second element to M(3.5)-TiO2 on yields of CHA and CHON in the photocatalytic reaction of AN. The yields of CHA and CHON over Ru(1.0)/Pt(3.5)-TiO2 and Ru(1.0)/Rh(3.5)-TiO2 decreased, indicating that Ru had a negative effect on Rh(3.5)-TiO2 and Pt(3.5)-TiO2. The decrease in the catalytic performance suggests that Pt and Rh particles were covered with Ru. Very interestingly, introduction of Ru to Pd(3.5)-TiO2 greatly increased the CHA yield and suppressed the CHON yield, even though Ru-TiO2 and Pd-TiO2 showed negligible activity for CHA production. Figs. 1 and 2 show that Ru/Pd-TiO2 was the most selective photocatalyst in ring hydrogenation of AN to CHA."
9,Photocatalytic ring hydrogenation of AN over Ru/Pd-TiO2,"3.2 Photocatalytic ring hydrogenation of AN over Ru/Pd-TiO2 Fig. 3 shows the effects of Pd and Ru loadings on the yields of CHA and CHON in the photocatalytic reaction of AN. Ru/Pd-TiO2 photocatalysts showed a volcano-like tendency against both Ru and Pd contents, and the highest yield of CHA was obtained at 3.5 mol% Pd and 1.0 mol% Ru. Fig. 4 (a) shows the time course of photocatalytic ring hydrogenation of AN over Ru(1.0)/Pd(3.5)-TiO2. Along with phothoirradiation, CHA was predominantly produced with a small amount of CHON. When AN was consumed almost completely after photoirradiation for 90 min, CHA was obtained with a high selectivity of 90%. Fig. 4(a) also shows the amount of CHON and material balance (MB) calculated from the amounts of CHA, CHON and AN by using Equation (1), (1) MB = n(CHA) + n(CHON) + n(AN) n 0 AN . MB decreased in an early stage before 30 min due to the formation of a small amount CHON and was almost unchanged after that, indicating that no other intermediate(s) and by-product(s) were formed. As shown in Fig. 4(b), evolution of H2 (2H+ + 2e− → H2) simultaneously occurred as the electron-consuming reaction. As the hole-trapping reaction, CO2 was produced by oxidation of OA ((COOH)2 + 2(e−—h+) → 2CO2 + 2e− + 2H+). The pressure inside the test tube reached 1.48 atm at 90 min due to the production of 450 µmol of CO2. According to the Henry’s law, the total amount of CO2 produced was roughly estimated to be 523 µmol and the value means that 529 µmol of electrons were provided from OA. Using this value, redox balance was calculated to be 0.99. For comparison, the time course of photocatalytic ring hydrogenation of AN over Ru-free Pd(3.5)-TiO2 is shown in Fig. S1. In contrast to the result of Ru(1.0)/Pd(3.5)-TiO2, a large amount of CHON was produced over Pd(3.5)-TiO2, resulting in the small value of CHA/H2."
10,Characterization of Pd-TiO2 and Ru/Pd-TiO2,"3.3 Characterization of Pd-TiO2 and Ru/Pd-TiO2 A TEM image of Pd(3.5)/TiO2 is shown in Fig. 5 (a), indicating that Pd nanoparticles were highly dispersed on TiO2. From the particle size distribution (Fig. 5(b)), the average diameter of the Pd nanoparticles was determined to be 5.0 nm. A TEM image of Ru(1.0)/Pd(3.5)-TiO2 is shown in Fig. 5(c). A large change was not observed in the image; however, the determined average diameter of the particles (6.6 nm) (Fig. 5(d)) was slightly larger than that of the original Pd nanoparticles. Since introduction of Ru to Pd-TiO2 by the photodeposition method was performed at room temperature, the possibility of an increase in the size of the original Pd particles can be ruled out. Therefore, the increased average diameter of the particles in Ru(1.0)/Pd(3.5)-TiO2 suggests that Pd nanoparticles were covered with an Ru layer with a thickness of 0.8 nm (Fig. S2). However, there is a possibility that a part of the Ru element was not deposited on the Pd particles but on the TiO2 surface. Fig. 6 (a) shows Pd3d5/2 and Pd3d3/2 XPS spectra of Pd(3.5)-TiO2 and Ru(1.0)/Pd(3.5)-TiO2. Metallic Pd (Pd0) and electron-deficient Pd species (Pd2+ and Pd4+) were observed in Pd(3.5)-TiO2, indicating that Pd atoms at the outer surface of the particles that had formed on TiO2 by using the photodeposition method were partially re-oxidized by exposure to air. The intensity of the peaks of Ru(1.0)/Pd(3.5)-TiO2 decreased, suggesting that the surface of Pd particles was covered with Ru introduced to Pd(3.5)-TiO2. Fitting parameters of the Pd3d5/2 spectra are summarized in Table 1 . By introduction of Ru to Pd(3.5)-TiO2, the proportion of metallic Pd (Pd0) decreased and the proportions of electron-deficient Pd species (Pd2+ and Pd4+) increased. This result suggests that Ru and Pd interact with each other and that Pd at the interface is in an oxidized state. Fig. 6(b) shows an Ru3d5/2 XPS spectrum of Ru(1.0)/Pd(3.5)-TiO2 together with a spectrum of Ru(1.0)/TiO2 prepared by the photodeposition method. Most of the Ru species in Ru(1.0)/TiO2 was in an electron-deficient state (Ru4+), indicating that Ru particles that had formed on TiO2 by using the photodeposition method were easily re-oxidized by exposure to air. Interestingly, a part of Ru in Ru(1.0)/Pd(3.5)-TiO2 remained in the metallic state (Ru0), although Ru(1.0)/Pd(3.5)-TiO2 was stored under air as well as Ru(1.0)/TiO2. As shown in Table 1, ca. 30% of Ru was in the metallic state (Ru0) in the presence of Pd. These results indicate that an inner part of the Ru species in Ru(1.0)/Pd(3.5)-TiO2 was stabilized in the metallic state due to the presence of Pd (Fig. S2). From these results, it can be concluded that the metallic Ru species work as active sites for ring hydrogenation reaction from AN to CHA over an Ru(1.0)/Pd(3.5)-TiO2 photocatalyst. However, since the increase in the proportion of metallic Ru cannot be explained by the reduction potentials of RuO2 and PdO (0.68 V vs SHE and 0.79 V vs SHE, respectively), some special interaction between Ru and Pd at the interface may stabilize metallic Ru atoms, although we have no clear information on this at present."
11,Effects of reaction conditions on ring hydrogenation of AN,"3.4 Effects of reaction conditions on ring hydrogenation of AN Table 2 shows the effects of various reaction conditions on the ring hydrogenation of AN in aqueous suspensions of metal-loaded TiO2 photocatalysts. Among monometallic photocatalysts, Pt(3.5)/TiO2 and Rh(3.5)/TiO2 showed high CHA selectivities (51% and 80%, respectively) (Entries 1 and 2). As shown previously, Ru(1.0)/Pd(3.5)-TiO2 exhibited a higher selectivity (90%) than those of Pt(3.5)/TiO2 and Rh(3.5)/TiO2 (Entry 3). The suppressed CHON production over Ru(1.0)/Pd(3.5)-TiO2 was in contrast to the production over Pt(3.5)/TiO2 and Rh(3.5)/TiO2. When the amount of OA was reduced from 900 μmol to 300 μmol, the CHA selectivity decreased to 80% and the CHON selectivity increased to 14% (Entry 4, Fig. S3). To understand the difference in selectivity, the values of pH of the reaction media were investigated (Fig. S4). The suspension in the presence of 900 μmol of OA was acidic (ca. pH 1) during the entire reaction (Fig. S4(a)) because OA still remained in the suspension. On the other hand, the suspension in the presence of 300 μmol changed to neutral at about 90 min due to the consumption of OA (Fig. S4(b)). These results suggest that an acidic condition is important for ring hydrogenation of AN to CHA. When the reaction in the presence of 300 μmol of OA was carried out in 0.1 mol dm−3 HCl solution, the CHA selectivity was improved together with suppression of CHON selectivity (Entry 5). It was clarified that the reaction system in which the reaction suspension was kept acidic (Entries 3 and 5) showed higher CHA selectivity than that in the system in which the reaction solution was changed to neutral (Entry 4). Under an acidic condition, AN exists as anilinium ions having a lower electron density of aromatic rings and being more susceptible to ring hydrogenation during the reaction. Reaction mechanisms for the formation of CHA and CHON will be discussed later. Three blank tests, (1) in the presence of Ru/Pd-TiO2 in the dark (thermocatalytic reaction over Ru/Pd-TiO2, Entry 6), (2) in the absence of Ru/Pd-TiO2 (photochemical reaction between AN and OA, Entry 7) and (3) in the absence of Ru/Pd-TiO2 in the dark (chemical reaction between AN and OA, Entry 8), were examined. The results indicated that Ru/Pd-TiO2 and photoirradiation are necessary for this reaction, in other words, ring hydrogenation is a photocatalytic reaction. Thermocatalytic reactions in the presence of H2 gas in the dark were also examined (Entries 9 and 10). Ring hydrogenation of AN in the presence of ca. 220 µmol H2 was negligible, and even under 1 atm H2 (ca. 1300 μmol), the AN yield was less than half of the yield of the photocatalytic reaction (Entry 4). These results show that the photocatalytic process using Ru/Pd-TiO2 is an efficient method for ring hydrogenation of AN. Ring hydrogenation was performed in alcohols, with the alcohols working as hole scavengers as well as solvents for the photocatalytic reactions (Entries 11–13). However, the reaction hardly proceeded in any of the alcohols for the following three reasons: (1) a decrease in the amount of AN adsorbed, (2) the absence of anilinium ions under the OA-free condition, and (3) the reaction between AN (or CHA) and carbonyl compounds produced from alcohols by hole scavenging. Photocatalytic reaction of CHA in water in the presence of OA gave no product (Entry 14). This result provides important information on the reaction mechanism, i.e., CHON was not produced from CHA but from AN."
12,Effect of reaction temperature,"3.5 Effect of reaction temperature To investigate the effect of reaction temperature, photocatalytic ring hydrogenation of AN over Ru/Pd-TiO2 was performed in a water bath kept at various temperatures under irradiation of light from a UV-LED (UVL-365A, San-ei Electric, λmax = 366 nm, 30 mW cM-2). The amounts of CHA and CHON increased linearly at each temperature (298–328 K) with photoirradiation time, indicating zero-order kinetics (Fig. S5). Fig. 7 shows Arrhenius plots (logarithm of k vs reciprocal of T) for ring hydrogenation of AN to CHA and CHON over Ru/Pd-TiO2. A linear correlation was obtained in each reaction. The values of apparent activation energy (Ea ) and pre-exponential factor (A) calculated from the slope and intercept of the Arrhenius plot are summarized in Table 3 . The value of Ea for ring hydrogenation from AN to CHA was determined to be 17 kJ mol−1, which was much smaller than the value of Ea for ring hydrogenation from AN to CHON (44 kJ mol−1). The value of A for ring hydrogenation reaction from AN to CHA (2.4 × 102 μmol min−1) was much smaller than the value of A for ring hydrogenation from AN to CHON (8.0 × 106 μmol min−1). The production of CHON having a large value of A was greatly suppressed at a lower temperature due to the large value of Ea , resulting in highly selective formation of CHA in ring hydrogenation of AN."
13,Adsorption experiments,"3.6 Adsorption experiments Fig. 8 shows the amounts of AN and CHA adsorbed onto TiO2, Pd(3.5)-TiO2, Ru(1.0)-TiO2 and Ru(1.0)/Pd(3.5)-TiO2. In the case of TiO2, adsorption of CHA is predominant compared with adsorption of AN. Adsorption experiments of Pd(3.5)-TiO2 and Ru(1.0)-TiO2 revealed that Pd strongly interacts with AN, while Ru does not show a strong interaction with AN. The adsorption property of Ru(1.0)/Pd(3.5)-TiO2 was completely different from that of Pd(3.5)-TiO2 and very similar to that of Ru(1.0)-TiO2. These adsorption properties of Pd(3.5)-TiO2, Ru(1.0)-TiO2 and Ru(1.0)/Pd(3.5)-TiO2 suggest that the surface of Pd particles is covered with Ru. The smaller amount of CHA adsorption than that of AN adsorption contributes to the smooth adsorption of AN and desorption of CHA in the photocatalytic reaction, resulting in efficient conversion of AN to CHA."
14,Expected reaction mechanism,"3.7 Expected reaction mechanism Fig. 9 shows an expected reaction mechanism of photocatalytic ring hydrogenation of AN to CHA over Ru/Pd-TiO2. Results of photocatalytic reaction, TEM, XPS and AN adsorption support the idea that the surface of Pd particles is covered with Ru and that metallic Ru works as active sites. Under UV light irradiation, OA is oxidized by h+ in the VB of TiO2 and, as a result, H+ and CO2 are produced. Over Ru/Pd particles, reduction of H+ by e− occurs and active hydrogen species are formed. The aromatic ring of AN is hydrogenated by six active hydrogen species, resulting in the formation of CHA. Two reactions from AN to CHA (main reaction) and from AN to CHON (side reaction) are shown in Scheme 1 . Under an acidic condition, most of the AN (1) is protonated to anilinium ions (2), which are converted to a compound (3) by six active hydrogen species. The compound (3) is de-protonated to CHA (4) under a basic condition of the extraction operation. When free AN is hydrogenated with active hydrogen species, 1-cyclohexene-1-amine (5) probably forms as an intermediate, which is converted to cyclohexanimine (6) by imine-enamine tautomerism. Cyclohexanimine reacts with water and releases NH3, which results in the formation of CHON (7). To obtain CHA with a high selectivity, an acidic condition is necessary as shown in Fig. S4 and Table 2."
15,Conclusions,"By using the photodeposition method, M-TiO2 and Ru/M-TiO2 were prepared and used for photocatalytic ring hydrogenation of AN to CHA in an aqueous solution in the presence of OA. Rh-TiO2 and Pt-TiO2 produced a large amount of CHA with suppressed formation of CHON, while Pd-TiO2 produced CHON with a small amount of CHA. Introduction of Ru to Pd-TiO2 greatly increased the CHA yield and suppressed the CHON yield, and Ru/Pd-TiO2 showed the best performance (90% CHA selectivity at >99% AN conversion) among the photocatalysts prepared in this study. In this reaction system, OA works as a hole scavenger (electron and hydrogen sources) and as an acid in order to keep the reaction solution acidic. Results of photocatalytic reaction, TEM, XPS and AN adsorption support the idea that the surface of Pd particles is covered with Ru and that metallic Ru works as active sites for ring hydrogenation of AN. In an acidic condition, the amino group was protonated and preserved from elimination via imine-enamine tautomerism. The side reaction (production of CHON) was also suppressed at a low temperature due to the large Ea over Ru/Pd-TiO2 (44 kJ mol−1) compared with Ea (17 kJ mol−1) for the CHA formation."
