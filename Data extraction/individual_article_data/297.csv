0,Introduction,"The development and utilization of hydrogen energy has become an important part of the energy supply system due to the gradual development of hydrogen production technology and increasing pressure of global climate change [1]. However, hydrogen is a flammable and explosive substance, which can easily lead to serious accidents [2–3]. Therefore, in the process of hydrogen production, the safe operation of the equipment is particularly important. At present, the methods commonly used for hydrogen production in industry mainly include electrolysis, water gas reforming, hydrocarbon cracking, steam reforming of hydrocarbons and so on. Among them, the method of steam reforming of hydrocarbons is widely used because of its advantages of reliable process, simple operation and low cost. Its general process is shown in Fig. 1 . In detail, after the reaction in the medium temperature shifting reactor, the mixed gas with the compositions of 74% H2 + 5% CH4 + 3% CO + 13% CO2 + 5% steam (volume fraction) is produced. The gas then passes through a series of heat exchangers to make full use of the remaining heat so as to achieve the purpose of saving energy. In the process of heat exchange, the part of the heat exchanger for deaerated water is shown in Fig. 2 . E201 is the heat exchanger of deaerated water, of which the gas is in the pipe side and the cooling water is in the shell side. The temperature of the cooling water increases after heat exchange and then it enters the air bag to supply heat for the steam generator boiler from E201, above which there is a cross line between the inlet and the outlet. In order to ensure that the deaerated water does not vaporize before entering the air bag, the valve for controlling gas flow has a 3–4 thread opening. In this way, part of the gas after medium temperature shifting reaction directly passes through the cross line and converges with the gas from the cross line at the tee joint. The design parameters of the mainline pipe are shown in Table 1 . In Shanghai, China, this method was adopted by a petrochemical factory to produce hydrogen, and the whole production line was put into use in May 2008. The original pipes between E201 and D206 were replaced due to degradation during the overhaul in April 2018 and the new pipes have the design life of 10 years. In June 2020, the field personnel found that there was water-drop leakage on the pipe between the heat exchanger for deaerated water and the first separation tank D206, as marked in Fig. 2. After removing the insulation layer, a crack was found at the bottom of the pipe and the water dripped here. For the sake of safety, the temporary measure of sealing by steel strip with pressure was immediately implemented by the field personnel (Fig. 3 ), and also failure analysis was planned. Aiming at the causes analysis of pipe failure in hydrogen production industry, some researches have been done. Viyanit et al. [4] dealt with the failure of a seamless pipe made of AISI 321 stainless steel used for hydrogen transportation and concluded that the rupture of the seamless pipe was influenced by hydrogen assisted cracking. Yoon et al. [5] analyzed the failure cause of a leaking T-pipe in a hydrocracking process and identified that the mechanism of hydrogen embrittlement induced cracking generated from the anodic corrosion process under a certain stress was the possible cause. Al-Mazeedi et al. [6] investigated the window-type rupture of a carbon steel pipe in a hydrocracking plant, and found out that the aggressive corrosion reaction contributed by ammonium bisulfide (ABS) and turbulence led to the failure. Chen et al. [7] studied the failure pressure of the corroded hydrogen storage pipeline at extremely low temperature and provided a novel failure pressure equation of the mild steel line pipe with corrosion defects. However, the abnormal leakage of the hydrogen gas pipe caused by interaction of several factors was seldom addressed. Based on the relevant experiences of our team [8–14], a series of materials characterization was conducted on the failed pipe for causes analysis. Also, by considering the actual operating conditions of the pipe, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was performed to analyze the influence of hydrogen gas flow on the pipe wall. The achievement of this study may be of great significance to ensure the safe use and prevent same problems of similar structures or equipment in hydrogen production industry."
1,Experimental methods and results,
2,Visual inspection,"2.1 Visual inspection Part of the failed pipe was cut into two sections along the direction of 6o'clock and 12o'clock, as shown in Fig. 4 (a). The left side of the pipe was the part without leakage. After penetrant testing (PT), the surface was smooth and no obvious defects were found. In contrast, the right side was the leakage part, and >10 circumferential cracks parallel to the welding seam could be clearly seen at the direction of 5o'clock. The main crack which caused leakage was about 540 mm away from the welding seam (Fig. 4(b), 1#). Turned the failed pipe over, and a steel-strip mark was visible on the outer surface (Fig. 4(c)). After magnification, it could be seen that the crack leading to leakage was in the middle of the strip mark, which was about 40 mm long (Fig. 4(d)). By measuring, the wall thickness was 11 mm without obvious thinning."
3,Basic material examination,"2.2 Basic material examination 2.2.1 Chemical compositions The chemical compositions of the failed pipe were detected by the optical emission spectrometer (OES) and the results are listed in Table 2 . The brand of TP321 is consistent with 06Cr18Ni11Ti in China. According to the standard GB/T 13296–2013 [15] the chemical compositions were qualified. The addition of Ti in TP321 steel controlled the formation of Cr3C2 effectively, improving the corrosion resistance at the grain boundaries. 2.2.2 Metallographic structure Specimens were taken from the longitudinal and circumferential directions of the failed pipe. After rough and fine grinding, rough and fine mechanical polishing were carried out on the specimens. Then the specimens were etched with the solution of 4% nitric acid in alcohol and rinsed with distilled water. Finally, the specimens were gently wiped with alcohol cotton and dried with an air drier. After the preparation, they were observed under an optical microscope (OM), as shown in Fig. 5 . The microstructure was mainly austenite, with a small amount of ferrite, and the grade of grain size was 3 according to the standard GB/T 6394–2017 [16]. The overall microstructure was relatively uniform without obvious decarburization and overburning. Furthermore, it was found that black particles were distributed irregularly in the matrix and the inclusions were type D spherical oxide with the grade of 1.0–1.5 compared with the standard GB/T 10561–2005 [17] but it had little effect on the properties. 2.2.3 Mechanical properties According to the standard GB/T 228.1–2010, GB/T 229–2007, GB/T 230.1–2018 [18–20], specimens were taken from the failed pipe for the tensile test, the impact test and the hardness measurement. Each test was carried out three times and the average value was taken. The results are listed in Table 3 , Table 4 and Table 5 . It could be seen that the elongation at break, the impact energy and the hardness of the specimens all meet the requirements of GB/T 13296–2013. However, the strength was slightly lower than the standard value."
4,Macroscopic and microscopic morphology,"2.3 Macroscopic and microscopic morphology Optical microscope, three-dimensional stereo microscope (3D-SM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) were used to analyze the 1# specimen with both cracks and leakage, the 2# specimen with cracks but without leakage (Fig. 4(b)), and the metallographic specimens of both of them. 2.3.1 1# specimen The specimen was manually broken along the direction of the superficial crack after immersing in liquid nitrogen for half an hour, seen in Fig. 6 (a) and (b). The black semi-ellipse area was the crack penetration zone where the gas leaked out, while the silver-white area was the fresh fracture area by manual breaking, as shown in Fig. 6(c). ts inner and outer surface were observed by 3D-SM and many processing stripes were found on the inner surface (Fig. 7 (a)). At the same time, there were also continuous step-like cracks at the processing stripes (Fig. 7(b)). In addition to the cracks, there were a large number of pits distributing irregularly on the inner wall of the pipe (Fig. 7(c)). As shown in Fig. 7(d), The austenite grain boundaries were obvious, and a main crack propagated along the grain boundaries, which was a typical morphology of intergranular stress corrosion cracking. In the same way, the outer surface of the specimen was observed by 3D-SM. A lot of pits with irregular distribution were also found, but there were no obvious defects such as processing stripes, step-like cracks and bare grains, as shown in Fig. 8 . Furthermore, the fracture which was the lower part in Fig. 6(c) was observed by SEM as well as its inner and outer surface. Fig. 9 (c) shows the overall morphology of the fracture. The upper side was the outer surface of the pipe, and the lower side was the inner surface. It was found that there was a transition zone of about 100 μm at the semi-ellipse crack region on the left side where there were obvious triangular grain boundaries and holes at the edge of the grain boundary (Fig. 9(a)). Considering the gas after medium temperature shifting reaction contained 74% H2, it could be inferred that these holes were formed by hydrogen bursting at the grain boundary after gathering to a certain concentration [21–22]. In addition, a pit was found on the right side. After magnification, it was found that the pit had developed along the thickness direction and caused a crack. In the process of the crack propagation, a trigeminal crack was induced at the triangular grain boundary, accompanied by the morphology of holes caused by hydrogen (Fig. 9(e)). For the inner surface of the specimen, the processing stripes and pits could be clearly seen in Fig. 10 (a). After further magnification, the bare grains and cracks at the grain boundaries could be found (Fig. 10(b)). The characteristics on the outer surface were similar to those on the inner surface except the processing stripes, but the grain size and the coverage area were obviously smaller than those on the inner surface (Fig. 10(d)), which was also the reason why this morphology could not be clearly observed by 3D-SM. 2.3.2 2# specimen Fig. 11 shows the macroscopic morphology of 2# specimen after breaking in liquid nitrogen along the direction of crack propagation. Compared with the morphology of 1# specimen, 2# specimen had two semi-ellipse crack areas on the fracture, which meant that there was more than one origin of the crack. In addition, it was worth noting that although the crack did not penetrate the pipe wall, the depth had reached 80% of the thickness, and there was a risk of gas leakage some time. The inner and the outer surfaces of 2# specimen were observed by 3D-SM. A lot of processing stripes along the circumferential direction (Fig. 12 (a)), cracks at the processing stripes (Fig. 12(b)), irregular distribution of pits (Fig. 12(c)) and bare grains (Fig. 12(d)) were found on the inner surface. In Fig. 12(d), it could be clearly seen that a crack existed inside the processing stripes, and the defect characteristics were similar to those found on the inner surface of 1# specimen. The outer surface of 2# specimen was relatively flat, and there were no obvious processing stripes, cracks, bare grains and intergranular cracks (Fig. 13 ). However, in view of the experience of 1# specimen, its microscopic morphology needed to be further verified in the following observation by SEM. The lower side of the fracture in Fig. 11(c) was observed by SEM, and Fig. 14 (c) shows the whole morphology. After magnifying the left semi-ellipse crack area, it could be found that the fracture showed the characteristic of quasi cleavage, and that of the manually-breaking fracture area showed the characteristic of dimple, as shown in Fig. 14(a). The pits on the inner surface of the left semi-ellipse crack area propagated along the thickness direction of the pipe wall and had initiated cracks at the bottom (Fig. 14(b)). In Fig. 14(d), local plastic deformation on the fracture could also be seen, indicating that the pipe had been subjected to large longitudinal stress. And it could be clearly found that there were many pits from the section under higher magnification (Fig. 14(e)). By SEM, clear processing stripes could be seen on the inner surface of 2# specimen (Fig. 15 (a)), and the phenomenon of bare grains and intergranular cracks could also be seen after magnification (Fig. 15(b)). These characteristics were consistent with those of the inner surface of 1# specimen, which proved the existence of such defects on the inner surface again. There were no obvious processing stripes on the outer surface of the specimen (Fig. 15(c)), but more pits could be seen (Fig. 15(d)), which was related to the salt-fog environment in the atmosphere and the untight insulation layer [23]. Compared with the outer surface of 1# specimen, the phenomenon of bare grains and intergranular cracks on the outer surface of 2# specimen was more obvious (Fig. 15(e)). Pits were also found at the edge, as shown in Fig. 15(f). In the above morphology observation, a lot of pits were found on the surface of 1# specimen and 2# specimen. For verification, the metallographic specimens were also observed by SEM. Fig. 16 (a) shows the overall morphology of the longitudinal specimen with cracks. The upper side of the specimen was the outer surface of the pipe, and the lower side was its inner surface. Two parallel cracks could be seen and the cracks continuously propagated along the thickness direction from the inner surface (Fig. 16(b)). After further magnification, it was found that there were dense pits on the edge (Fig. 16(c)). The average depth of these pits was about 20 μm, and the average interval between pits was about dozens of microns, which was close to the grain size. Therefore, it could be inferred that these pits were formed by the interaction of pitting corrosion and intergranular corrosion. Then the chemical compositions in the tips of these pits were detected by EDS. As listed in Table 6 , all of the three pits contained chlorine, which proved that these pits were formed by chloride-induced pitting corrosion. On the contrary, the upper side of the specimen was relatively smooth, and no pits were found. The circumferential specimen without cracks was also observed and a group of pits were found on the inner surface, as shown in Fig. 17 (a). When the place with the red box was further magnified (Fig. 17(b)), it could be seen that a narrow and deep pit were formed at the bottom of the processing stripes on the inner surface. This special morphology clearly showed the mechanism of pitting corrosion from the surface defects to the deep [24–26]. The tips of these pits also contained a certain amount of chlorine (Table 7 ), which was similar to those in the longitudinal specimens. Chlorine ion was the main cause of pitting corrosion and intergranular corrosion."
5,Computational fluid dynamics analysis,"Considering that the failed pipe was located at the outlet of the tee joint, the flow field in the pipe was more complex, so ANSYS Fluent 19.2 was used to explore the influence of the gas on the pipe wall."
6,Modeling and conditions,"3.1 Modeling and conditions Based on the failed pipe, the following physical model was established (Fig. 18 ). In order to simplify the calculation process, the inner diameter of the pipe was set as 355 mm, the length of the two inlets of the tee joint was set as 150 mm, and the length of the outlet was set as 1500 mm. The inflation and unstructured grids were taken when meshing. The composition of the medium in the pipe was 74% H2 + 5% CH4 + 3% CO + 13% CO2 + 5% H2O(g). According to the actual operating conditions, the boundary conditions were defined as follows: the inlet was the velocity inlet, and the velocity of the medium in the pipe was 10 m/s. The outlet was the pressure outlet, and the pressure was 2.1 MPa. The length of the inlet of the model was short, which was close to the temperature at the junction of tee joint, so the temperature was set as 260 ℃ (according to the measurement on the spot, the actual temperature of the gas after converging at the tee joint was 256 ℃ in production, and the service temperature of the pipe was obviously higher than the design temperature of 182 ℃). The control equations included continuity equation, momentum equation and RNG k-ε turbulence model and the convergence accuracy was 10−5. Finally, the influence of the medium on the pipe wall was investigated from the flow state of the medium, shear stress, turbulence kinetic energy."
7,Simulation results,"3.2 Simulation results According to the simulation results, the medium entered the pipe from the inlet 1 and the inlet 2 at the speed of 10 m/s perpendicular to the inlet section and converged at the center of the tee joint. The velocity of the medium reached the maximum value of 29.63 m/s, about 500 mm away from the outlet of the tee joint, and then the velocity gradually decreased and the medium tended to be evenly distributed in the pipe (Fig. 19 ). The shear stress produced by the medium flow on the pipe wall was more obvious in the range of 0 mm-750 mm at the outlet (Fig. 20 ). It was mainly due to the unstable flow after the gas converged from different directions. However, in terms of the numerical value, the shear stress was very small and it had little effect on the crack initiation. The turbulence kinetic energy was also relatively high in this region (Fig. 21 ), which reflected the instability of the medium flow and exacerbated corrosion more obviously than other regions. From the overall simulation results, the erosion effect of the gas on the pipe wall was little, which also verified the phenomenon of no obvious thinning of the wall mentioned above. However, compared with other regions, the gas was more unstable in the range of 0 mm-750 mm away from the outlet of the tee joint, which was more likely to accelerate the formation of cracks. The range was basically consistent with that where the crack group occurred."
8,Discussions,"The visual inspection, material examination, morphology observation of the fractures and their inner and outer surfaces of the pipe, as well as flow field analysis in the pipe were carried out above. These results would be comprehensively discussed below to explore the failure process."
9,The pipe and its surface condition,"4.1 The pipe and its surface condition 4.1.1 Material and processing stripes From the test results of chemical composition, metallographic structure and mechanical properties of the failed pipe, it could be concluded that these factors would not directly lead to the crack initiation and then cause the leakage on the pipe. Through the observation of the inner and outer surfaces of the specimens, a large number of processing stripes (Fig. 7(a), Fig. 10(a), Fig. 12(a), Fig. 15(a)) were found on the inner surface of 1# specimen and 2# specimen, but no such defects were found on the outer surface. Therefore, it could be concluded that during the manufacturing process, the inner surface of the pipe was not polished after processing, so the stripes were left. The existence of these processing stripes changed the local stress state to a certain extent. 4.1.2 Bare grains and intergranular corrosion It was also found that there were bare grains and intergranular corrosion with different degrees on the pipe (Fig. 7(d), Fig. 10(b, d), Fig. 12(d), Fig. 15(b, e, f)), especially for the inner surface. Furthermore, the inner and outer surfaces of the pipe were in different operating conditions. The corrosion resistance of stainless steel is mainly due to the dense oxide film Cr2O3 on its surface. Although the oxide film can form spontaneously on the surface of stainless steel, it is not dense. Therefore, the natural oxides on the surface of TP321 stainless steel pipe needs to be removed by acid pickling, and then a uniform and dense passivation film will form on the surface of the pipe by passivation processing to improve its corrosion resistance. But from the poor condition on both the inner and outer surfaces of the pipe, it could be concluded that the surface passivation processing was inappropriate and therefore resulted in the incomplete passivation film."
10,Environment,"4.2 Environment 4.2.1 Corrosive environment After the medium temperature shifting reaction, the gas contained 13% CO2 and 5% steam. Due to the effect of high pressure, part of the steam changed into water, and then the acid medium would be formed from the reaction between CO2 and H2O. In such a situation, the corrosion would gradually occur on the surface. The process could be described as follows: (1) H2O + CO2 → H2CO3 (2) H2CO3 → HCO3 − + H+ (3) HCO3 − → CO3 2− + H+ (4) Fe + 2H+ → H2 + Fe2+ (5) CO3 2− + Fe2+ → FeCO3 The overall equation which led to local corrosion could be summarized as: (6) H2O (l) + CO2 (g) + Fe (s) → FeCO3(s) + H2 (g) Besides, the cooling water in the pipe contained much aggressive chloride ions, and a large number of intergranular corrosion cracks were formed on the inner surface due to incomplete passivation film, both of which created a favorable condition for the aggregation of chloride ions. So pitting corrosion was initiated at the grain boundaries on the inner surface. The process of pitting corrosion can be described as: (7) Fe → Fe2+ + 2e− (8) Fe2+ + 2Cl− → FeCl2(in pit) (9) FeCl2 + 2H2O → Fe(OH)2 + 2H+ + 2Cl−(in pit) (10) H2O + 1/2O2 + 2e− → 2OH−(out of pit) This is an autocatalytic corrosion process. Therefore, the metal in the pit was continuously dissolved, and the pit gradually propagated along the thickness direction. The average distance between the pits in Fig. 16(c) and Fig. 17(a) was close to the grain size (tens of microns), which strongly proved the process of corrosion damage. Similarly, in addition to chloride ions, the intergranular corrosion cracks were also conducive to the aggregation of the hydrogen molecules since the gas contained 74% hydrogen gas. Due to the small volume of hydrogen molecules, they were easy to penetrate into the cracks and accumulate in-situ. When the hydrogen molecules accumulated to a certain extent, they would burst at the grain boundaries and the micro holes were therefore formed, as shown in Fig. 9(b). Once the defects such as processing stripes, pits, intergranular corrosion and holes caused by hydrogen were formed on the inner surface of the pipe, they together provided the prerequisite of stress corrosion cracking. 4.2.2 Stress state According to the film stress equation of pressure vessel, the longitudinal stress σx and circumferential stress σθ of the pipe were calculated by Eq. (11) and Eq. (12) respectively. (11) σ x = PD 4 t (12) σ θ = PD 2 t In it, P, the operating pressure, 2.1 MPa; D, the medium diameter of the pipe, 366 mm; t, the wall thickness, 11 mm. The results showed that the longitudinal stress and circumferential stress of the pipe were 17.47 MPa and 34.94 MPa, respectively, which were far smaller than the yield strength 187 MPa of the pipe. Also, the circumferential stress 34.94 MPa was twice the longitudinal stress 17.47 MPa, however the cracks on the inner surface were distributed along the circumferential direction caused by the longitudinal stress rather than the longitudinal direction caused by the circumferential stress. This phenomenon was really peculiar. Two aspects contributed to it. First of all, there were a large number of circumferential processing stripes on the inner surface of the pipe, which changed the stress state of the inner surface, resulting in local stress concentration. Secondly, the failed pipe was located between the tee and the 90° elbow. Generally speaking, the rigid pipe fittings are usually fixed before welding the pipe. If the pipe and its fittings could not be completely aligned, forced assembly may be taken, which would produce large tensile stress on the pipe, as shown in Fig. 22 . This phenomenon did exist after verification with the field personnel. 4.2.3 Flow field The failed pipe had been in service for more than one year, but the wall thickness had not been significantly reduced by measuring. From the flow state, shear stress, turbulence kinetic energy by ANSYS fluent, it could be seen that the erosion effect of the gas on the pipe was not very severe. However, the gas after converging was in an unstable state, which would produce a certain impact force on the inner surface of the pipe and help to initiate the cracks indeed. In addition, the temperature of the gas after converging was higher than 250 ℃, and the pressure was 2.1 MPa. The gas contained 5% steam. Due to the high fluid pressure, part of the steam was in the liquid phase and distributed in the area between five o'clock and six o'clock in the pipe. This area was located in the interface of the dry and the wet gases, which was easier to exacerbate corrosion than other places due to the alternation of the gases."
11,Failure process,"4.3 Failure process At first, the inner surface of the failed pipe was not polished after processing, so there were a lot of processing stripes distributed along the circumferential direction. These stripes led to local stress concentration and became the susceptible places for corrosion. Meanwhile, the passivation processing of the inner surface was inappropriate, and the passivation film was not complete. Then pitting corrosion and intergranular corrosion occurred at the stripes in the acid medium with a large amount of chloride ions. These chloride ions were continuously aggregated in the intergranular cracks and the pitting corrosion gradually propagated inwards. In addition, the accumulation and bursting of hydrogen in the cracks also caused material damage and reduced the bonding force between the grains. What’s more, forced assembly occurred in the installation of the pipe, which would produce tensile stress on the pipe. Generally, the concentration of chloride ions exceeds 10 ppm and stress corrosion cracking (SCC) will be initiated for austenitic stainless steel in the hot environment [27–29]. The tensile stress as well as the chloride ions and the acid medium initiated the stress corrosion cracking on the inner surface together, further exacerbating the crack propagation. Finally, the cracks penetrated through the pipe wall and caused the leakage under the interaction of these factors (Fig. 23 )."
12,Conclusions and countermeasures,"Based on the failure analysis, the main conclusions could be drawn as follows: (1) The cracks were all caused by the interaction among pitting corrosion, intergranular corrosion and stress corrosion cracking at the processing stripes. Therefore, the root cause of the failure could be determined that the inner surface was not polished after processing, and then resulted in stress concentration. (2) Incomplete passivation film due to inappropriate passivation processing was another root cause of the failure. (3) The additional assembly stress between the pipe and fitting also produced larger longitudinal tensile stress. This was also an important cause of the failure. With the reference to the above conclusions, the following countermeasures are put forward: (1) Strengthen the inspection of the surface quality of the TP321 stainless steel pipes to avoid the surface defects. According to the current operating conditions, 316L stainless steel with better pitting corrosion resistance is a better choice for manufacturing the pipe. (2) Reduce the pipe-side temperature of E201, so that the temperature of the gas after converging is not too high. Meanwhile, the content of chloride ion in cooling water should be strictly controlled to avoid local corrosion of the pipe. (3) Tensile stress has a great influence on stress corrosion cracking (SCC), so the additional assembly stress should be minimized as much as possible."
