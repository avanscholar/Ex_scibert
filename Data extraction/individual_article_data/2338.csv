0,Introduction,"In catalysis, metal nanoparticles (MNPs), which possess a high electron density and surface-to-volume ratio, play a crucial role in the field of organic transformations. MNPs have been reported as suitable catalyst for the conversion of alcohols to aldehydes [1–4]. Among the various reported MNPs, silver NPs are more efficient and promising owing to their high catalytic activity and selectivity [5]. The aggregation of NPs can be prevented by incorporating them into a heterogeneous support; this methodology has the potential for catalyst recycling and reuse [6]. A wide range of support structures has been developed for the implantation of MNPs, which includes carbon-based materials [7–9], metal-oxides [10], polymers [11,12], metal-organic frameworks [13], and mesoporous silica [14,15]. Among these supporting materials, mesoporous silica materials are highly attractive owing to their tunable pore sizes, high surface area, and chemical and thermal stability [16]. In particular, SBA‒15 has been developed to overcome the drawbacks of the microporous system as the porosity of the support will increase the mass transportation rate, which is a significant advantage in organic reactions. SBA‒15 has been used in various applications, such as catalysis, air purification, drug delivery, and water treatment [16–19]. Another benefit of mesoporous silica materials is that the surface channels can be modified with distinctive functional groups, which ensures that functional materials such as MNPs are easily loaded inside the pores [14,16–22]. In contrast, poly (dimethyl aminoethyl methacrylate) (p(DMAEMA)) is one of the most commonly used weak polybasic dually (temperature and pH) responsive polymer. The temperature sensitivity results from (dimethyl amino) ethyl groups and generates a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) at approximately 45–50 °C. As the solution temperature increases above the LCST, polymer chains undergo a transition from an extended random coil to globular conformation and become hydrophobic. The p(DMAEMA) also showed pH-responsiveness under a pKa of 7–7.5, which is related to the degree of protonation and deprotonation of the tertiary amine side groups in the polymer. The polymer is easily soluble in acidic aqueous environment [23–32]. The LCST of p(DMAEMA)/modified SBA‒15 (here, abbreviated as PDMS, while the modified SBA-15 is named as MS.) fluctuates between higher and lower temperatures by copolymerization with a hydrophilic or hydrophobic monomer, which contributes to the extended lifetime, colloidal stability, and reusability of the catalysts, and is essential for the catalytic reactions [33]. Moreover, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (2-HEA), with LCST of approximately 30–35 °C, is widely studied as a biocompatible thermo-responsive polymer; furthermore, it can be used as a co-monomer, which consists of hydrophilic groups that are water-swellable instead of water soluble [31–34]. The insolubility is due to hydrogen bonding between the polymeric hydroxyl groups. In previous reports, AgNPs incorporated into mesoporous silica materials were found to be promising for various catalytic oxidation and alkylation reactions, among others. In addition, polymer grafted mesoporous silica has attracted significant attention in various range of applications, particularly for the oxidation of alcohols [35,36]. Liu et al. developed a bimetallic catalyst using Au and Ag with the support of zeolite imidazole framework [37]. The developed catalyst showed the oxidation of benzyl alcohol with the yield of 87% at 138 °C. Similarly, Liu et al. developed bimetallic catalyst using Ag and manganese (Mn) as well as Ag and copper (Cu) with the support of silicon carbide (SC) [38]. These catalysts also demonstrated good catalytic behaviour for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol with the yield of 98–99% at 280 °C. Recently, Jia et al. developed Ag doped hexagonal mesoporous silica, which showed a 96% of yield for the similar catalytic reactions at 240 °C [39]. The main drawbacks of these catalysts are, however, the use of high temperature. To overcome the drawback of using high temperature for catalytic reactions, we have synthesized a novel Ag doped dual responsive polymer coated SBA-15. Our material showed excellent catalytic behaviour at room temperature in comparison to the reported materials. In addition, our current interest in this field led us to scrutinize the combination of stimuli-responsive polymer/inorganic hybrid materials that incorporated MNPs support to form a controllable catalyst. Below the LCST and pKa value of the copolymer, the polymer chains collapse and swell to open the pores, thereby allowing the reactants into the mesopores to react with MNPs inside the pores. When heated above the LCST, the dehydrated copolymer chains shrink, which blocks the pores and prevents the reactants from entering into the pores, thereby decreasing the rate of reaction. [28,29]. Therefore, we synthesized copolymer-grafted mesoporous silica containing AgNPs to facilitate the alteration of LCST value, resulting in lowering the temperature, which may effectively improve the rate of reaction during catalysis at room temperature using water as a solvent. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a recyclable SBA‒15 supported dual (temperature and pH) responsive AgNPs/p (DMAEMA-co-HEA)/modified SBA‒15 catalytic system and illustrate its application in the oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds under mild reaction conditions using an efficient, selective, and environmentally friendly system. Our synthesized novel AgNPs loaded dual responsive polymer coated SBA‒15 expressed excellent catalytic behavior at room temperature over the reported materials."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation of p(DMAEMA-co-HEA)/MS hybrid particles (PDHMS),"2.1 Preparation of p(DMAEMA-co-HEA)/MS hybrid particles (PDHMS) In accordance with the literature [38], we have prepared SBA‒15 and modified it with 3-trimethoxysilylpropyl methacrylate (TMSPM) as a functionalization unit (detailed procedure is included in the Supplementary Data). A solution of 0.6 g of DMAEMA and 0.4 g of 2-HEA was dissolved in 13 mL of ethanol and 13 mL water, which was prepared in a three-neck flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirrer. Then, 0.2 g of the modified SBA-15 (i.e. MS) was added to the reaction mixture under nitrogen (N2) atmosphere to remove oxygen. After vigorous stirring of the suspension for 1 h, 0.027 g of K2S2O8 initiator was added, and the reaction flask was immersed in an oil bath and heated to 80 °C under N2 atmosphere. The suspension became turbid after the addition of K2S2O8. The polymerization reaction was continued while stirring for 6 h at the same temperature. The obtained product was cooled and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min, and then washed sequentially with water and ethanol several times. The as-prepared product was dried under vacuum at 50 °C and was denoted as PDHMS."
3,Loading of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) into PDHMS,"2.2 Loading of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) into PDHMS Loading of AgNPs inside the pores of PDHMS material was conducted by the co-precipitation method. Herein, 0.05 g of PDHMS was dispersed in water under sonication for 15 min. The suspension was stirred continuously for 2 h at room temperature before 0.01 M solution of AgNO3 was added. The reaction was kept for 8 h under N2 atmosphere with continuous stirring and then reduced with 0.1 M NaBH4 solution. The reduced suspension turned black after a few hours, and the reaction was proceeded with vigorous stirring for 1 h. The catalyst was recovered by the process of filtration and washed thoroughly with water. The sample was dried at 50 °C, and the catalyst obtained was denoted as AgNPs/PDHMS."
4,Catalytic oxidation of alcohols,"2.3 Catalytic oxidation of alcohols The catalyst activity was tested using selective oxidation of different alcohols to aldehydes or ketones. In a typical experiment, 6 mg of catalyst and 1 mmol of H5IO6 oxidant were dissolved in 6 mL of distilled water. The mixture turned white while being stirred for 15 min. Then, 1.0 mmol of benzyl alcohol was slowly added to this mixture, and the reaction mixture was stirred in a round bottom flask at room temperature for 1 h. The catalyst was separated from the mixture by filtration, and the remaining alcohols and aldehydes were extracted with diethyl ether. The extracted product was washed with water and brine solution. The purified products were obtained through column chromatography. The isolated products were characterized by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra using CDCl3 solvent. The catalyst was washed thoroughly with water, ethanol, and dried in an oven before reusing for the next run."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of materials,"3.1 Characterization of materials The synthesis method tailored for the grafting of copolymer on mesoporous silica (SBA‒15) particles is shown in Fig. 1 . Details of characterization methods of materials are described in the Supplementary Data. In the first step of the reaction, the hydroxyl groups present on the external surface of SBA‒15 were functionalized with organo alkoxysilane (TMSPM) through Si–O–Si linkages, resulting in the formation of C꞊C bonds on the surface of SBA‒15. In the second step, copolymerization of the grafted particles with DMAEMA and 2-HEA was conducted. Silanol groups do not typically interfere with chain propagation during the polymerization. The structure of the copolymer and its grafting are shown in Fig. 1. Finally, AgNPs were loaded into the PDHMS by reduction with NaBH4. The temperature-responsive behavior of the catalyst depends upon the shrinking and swelling of the copolymer chain upon heating and cooling. The pH responsivity is due to the protonation and deprotonation nature of dimethyl amino groups (pKa of 7–7.5). At a low pH, the amino groups in DMAEMA have a positive charge; therefore, maximum swelling occurs and the pores are found to be in the open state. In contrast, the closing of the mesopores occurs, at high pH conditions due to the deprotonation of amino groups. Fig. 2 shows the Fourier-transform infrared (FT‒IR) spectra of SBA‒15, MS, PDMS, and PDHMS. The FT‒IR spectrum of SBA‒15 displays a large broad band at 3438 cm−1, which is related to the O–H stretching vibration of the surface silanol groups [23,26,27]. The band at 1073 cm−1 (partially overlapping with the band at 1205 cm−1) is assigned to the asymmetric stretching vibrations of Si–O–Si moieties, while the band at 804 cm−1 is the bending mode of Si–O–Si. The band at 967 cm−1 belongs to the stretching vibration mode of Si–OH, whereas the peak at 463 cm−1 is associated with the asymmetric stretching vibration of siloxane bonds. The lack of adsorption bands in the 3100‒2860 cm−1 range (-CH2 stretching) and 1460‒1440 cm−1 (-CH2 bending) proved the complete elimination of Pluronic P123 from the SBA-15 [24–27]. We have used TMSPM for the surface modification of SBA-15. A different characteristic peak at approximately 1708 cm−1 was detected due to the CO stretching vibration of the ester group, and the peaks at 2856 and 2952 cm−1 confirmed the modification of silanol group using organo alkoxysilane (TMSPM). As mentioned in Fig. 1, a condensation reaction occurred between the silane group of TMSPM and OH groups from SBA-15 during functionalization process. Then the Si–OH bonding was converted to Si–O–Si, by the elimination of methanol, and correspondingly the intensity of the band at 967 cm−1 due to the stretching vibration mode of Si–OH was decreased. Since the carbonyl stretching peaks from ester groups appearing at approximately 1725 cm−1 are related to the establishment of p(DMAEMA) on the mesoporous SBA‒15 surface, the intensities of the C–H stretching vibration peaks increase. After the copolymerization of 2-HEA with DMAEMA, the intensity of the CO stretching vibration at 1725 cm−1 also increased. 13C NMR spectra of MS and PDHMS also evidenced the successful grafting of the p(DMAEMA-co-HEA) on the surface of MS, though some unreacted CC carbons still remain in the catalyst (Fig. S1). Fig. 3 a shows the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) image of the SBA‒15. The typical long rod-like aggregated structures and uniformity in particle distribution indicate the formation of particles with SBA‒15 characteristics. The preparation of SBA‒15 with P123 copolymer results in the formation of rod-shaped morphology. The surface of the material was very smooth and clear, and no defects were present. The mesoporosity was developed by the self-assembly of the surfactant (P123) and the generation of micelles followed by the surface covering with the precursor, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), and subsequent removal of template. The formation of thin polymer covering on the surface of the MS confirms the copolymerization. In contrast, the exterior surface was found to be considerably rough due to the agglomeration of the particles (Fig. 3b). Even after the AgNPs were loaded, the morphology of the catalysts was not affected, and all the materials appeared to have SBA‒15 morphology. The bright spots distributed on the SBA‒15 surface confirmed the presence of some agglomerated AgNPs. The diameter and length of rod-shaped SBA‒15 was approximately 130 nm and 1 μm, respectively (Fig. 3c) [24–26]. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images show the size, and distribution of AgNPs on the mesoporous SBA‒15. Two-dimensional cylindrical mesopore structures with a uniform pore size were observed for the synthesized SBA‒15 (Fig. 4 a). The material revealed well-structured parallel pore channels in the longitudinal axis of SBA‒15. The HR-TEM image of the SBA‒15 modified with TMSPM also maintained an extremely ordered pore structure of SBA‒15 (Fig. 4b). After the polymerization of MS with DMAEMA and 2-HEA, the mesoporosity was preserved (Fig. 4c). Fig. 4c shows the well-preserved ordered structures of the silica material after uniform metal doping, thereby confirming its structural reliability. High-angular dark field (HAADF)-TEM images, together with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping, indicated the presence of AgNPs in the AgNPs/PDHMS catalyst. According to the data, the weight % of the loaded AgNPs was found to be 1.03% in the catalyst (Fig. 5 ). In addition, the presence of other elements, such as Si, C, and O, was also confirmed. The average particle size of the AgNPs was 1.2 nm, which was determined from the HR-TEM image using the Image J software (Fig. S2). The surface elemental compositions and chemical oxidation states of the AgNPs/PDHMS catalyst were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 6 a). For C1s, the binding energy was found to be 284.6 eV, which is the characteristic peak of the C–C bond in the catalyst (Fig. 6b). Additionally, for the oxidized C1s carbon, the binding energies were 283.9 eV (C–H), 284.8 eV (C–C), 285.9 eV (C–N), and 288.5 eV (C꞊O–O) [36]. The binding energies of Ag3d show two peaks at 367.4 and 373.3 eV corresponding to Ag3d5/2 and Ag3d3/2, respectively (Fig. 6c). The spin energy between the two peaks was calculated as 6.1 eV, which reveals metallic AgNPs, and hence the oxidation state of Ag was confirmed to be zero [38–42]. The Si2p spectrum reveals binding energy of 102.79 eV, which is attributed to SiO2 (Fig. 6d). The deconvoluted O1s spectrum signifies three different binding energies at 531.1 eV (CO), 532.6 eV (O–Si), and 532.8 eV (COO) (Fig. 6e). The N1s spectrum shows a peak at binding energy of 399.7 eV (Fig. 6f). The binding energy and surface elemental compositions of AgNPs/PDHMS acquired from the XPS analysis are summarized in Table S1. The atomic concentration (%) of Ag (0) examined by XPS studies was almost comparable to the EDX data. The small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) patterns of the as-synthesized materials are shown in Fig. 7 . All the materials have typical diffraction patterns with characteristic peaks of the mesoporous SBA‒15. The SAXS patterns of pristine SBA‒15 show three well-resolved peaks at a scattering vector, i.e., q* = 0.06, 0.11, and 0.13, indexed to the (100), (110), and (220) reflection planes, respectively, which are associated with the 2D hexagonal pore array of SBA‒15 with P6mm symmetry [42]. It was also observed that the structure of the SBA‒15 type materials was well preserved for the surface-modified material, although a slight decrease in intensity at the d-spacing (110) and (200) and (100) peak was observed due to the modification of SBA‒15 mesoporous surface [23–26]. The ordered structure of the SBA‒15 channels was further diminished after grafting p(DMAEMA) onto it, where the (110) peak was slightly shifted to the right and broadened. The decrease in the intensities of (110) and (200) peaks and a slight shift toward right side could be interpreted as a decrease in the pore size of the material, confirming that the introduction of the copolymer with DMAEMA and 2-HEA could slightly affect the mesoporous structure of SBA‒15. After loading AgNPs, similar behavior was observed. The wide-angle XRD (WAXRD) patterns of AgNPs/SBA‒15 and AgNPs/PDHMS are shown in the Supplementary Data (Fig. S3). A very broad peak appearing in the 2θ range of 24° was attributed to the amorphous structure of pristine SBA-15. The analysis of AgNPs using XRD patterns predicted the crystallinity and purity of synthesized AgNPs inside the mesoporous silica (SBA‒15). Strong diffraction peaks of the AgNPs/PDHMS catalyst comprise four well-resolved sharp characteristic peaks at 38°, 44°, 64°, and 77° corresponding to the diffraction planes of (111), (200), (220), and (311), respectively, and the WAXRD patterns prove that the SBA‒15 peaks do not disappear after loading of AgNPs [43]. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of the SBA‒15, MS, PDHMS, and AgNPs/PDHMS are shown in Fig. 8 . As shown in the figure, the pristine SBA-15, MS, and PDHMS feature the same IV (a) type with H1 hysteresis loop according to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) classification in 2015 [44]. The hysteresis loops were observed in the partial relative pressure range of 0.6–0.8 due to capillary condensation, demonstrating that the material has defined cylindrical pores [28,29]. For the AgNPs decorated material, however, the hysteresis loop changes into H2(a) type featuring a characteristic desorption closure point at p/p0 = 0.43. This evidences the effect of cavitation of the adsorptive in partially blocked mesopores and as such, it strongly evidences the successful incorporation of AgNPs in the material. The surface area, pore volume, and pore size distribution of the pristine SBA‒15 was 707 m2 g-1, 0.96 cm3 g-1, and 6.5 nm, respectively. The mesopores of modified materials were occupied by organic groups, thereby decreasing the surface area, pore volume, and size. A decrease in the pore size can be clearly identified by the hysteresis loop shift to a lower relative pressure. After the incorporation of AgNPs, the surface parameters were again reduced, which confirmed the presence of AgNPs in the mesopores. The data obtained from the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were used to extract the surface parameters of the samples, which are listed in Table 1 . Based on these data, specific surface area of MS, PDHMS, and AgNPs/PDHMS were 581, 307, and 276 m2 g-1, respectively, with corresponding pore volume were 0.78, 0.49, and 0.38 cm3 g-1, respectively, and pore diameters were 6.0, 5.2, and 4.1 nm, respectively, which established the binding of all organic moieties on the pristine SBA‒15. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted to measure the thermal stability of the material in the temperature range of 30–800 °C under N2 atmosphere. The results of TGA curves of SBA‒15, MS, and PDHMS are plotted in Fig. 9 a. The calcined SBA‒15 shows the complete exclusion of the surfactant during the process of calcination. The MS showed a 17% weight loss over the whole heating period between 280 and 430 °C due to the disintegration of organic moiety, which proved the successful attachment of TMSPM on SBA‒15. Furthermore, when the copolymer was coated, the weight loss of the sample at 350–485 °C was found to be 31%, which confirmed the successful coating of the copolymer of DMAEMA with 2-HEA on the modified surface of SBA‒15. The weight loss difference between the modified and copolymerized SBA‒15 was 14%. The differential thermogravimetric (DTG) curves were depicted in Fig. 9b. The DTG curve of SBA‒15 showed that there is no peak from 30 to 800 °C, indicating the complete removal of surfactant from the material during the calcination. In contrast, a maximum decomposition peak was observed for both MS and PDHMS at 350–485 °C, which confirms the modification of SBA‒15 b y TMSPM as well as further polymerization."
7,Stimuli-responsive performance,"3.2 Stimuli-responsive performance The stimuli-responsive performance of the AgNPs/PDHMS catalyst with respect to particle size was studied at different pH values and temperatures (20–50 °C). DLS was used to measure the changes in hydrodynamic diameter (DH) of AgNPs/PDMS and AgNPs/PDHMS particles in aqueous solution at pH 7 (Fig. 10 a). The particle size distribution of the AgNPs/PDHMS catalyst with their polydispersity is provided in Fig. S4 and Fig. S5 as a function of temperature and pH. The average DH of AgNPs/PDMS particles was noticeable changes from 950 to 690 nm and the average DH of AgNPs/PDHMS particles decreased from 919 to 662 nm on increasing the temperature from 20 to 50 °C at pH 7, which can be attributed to the hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding [45]. The AgNPs/PDMS particles displayed a fine transition at 45 °C since the LCST of PDMS is at approximately 45–50 °C, as already mentioned in the Introduction. The average size of AgNPs/PDHMS particles decreased progressively over the 30–35 °C temperature range, which was attributed to the existence of the 2-HEA units that lowered the LCST of PDMS. At a low temperature, the copolymer fragments arranged into a random coil conformation mainly due to the intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions. As the temperature increased, the copolymer segments were dehydrated, and the intermolecular hydrophobic interactions dominated, resulting in the collapse of the copolymer segments on the surface of SBA‒15. These results demonstrate the copolymerization of the 2-HEA and DMAEMA monomers, which broadened and lowered the LCST. Fig. 10b shows the temperature and pH-responsiveness of the AgNPs/PDHMS catalyst dispersed in aqueous environment. The average particle size decreased from 1093 to 678 nm as the pH values increases from 2 to 10 over the temperature ranges from 20 to 50 °C. This behavior was attributed to the tertiary amine functional groups formed after protonation in the p(DMAEMA), which caused the AgNPs/PDHMS colloidal particles to stretch completely. The repulsion between the like charges causes p(DMAEMA) content in the copolymer chains in extended conformation. Moreover, the electrostatic repulsion between the p(DMAEMA) units is opposite to the hydrophobic interactions [24,45]. Under acidic conditions, complete swelling and positive charge formation on amino groups (NH3 +) were recognized on the copolymer with p(DMAEMA), which is responsible for the significantly larger particle sizes noticed at pH values of 2 and 6. When the pH values increase, the amino groups are deprotonated (NH2), resulting in an increase in the hydrophobic interaction; therefore, the average DH of the catalyst decreases due to deprotonation of the side ammonium group of the polymer. At pH 10, the p(DMAEMA) blocks are in a coiled conformation, and hereafter a smaller DH is detected. This behavior was attributed to the increased hydrophobicity ensuing from ionization of DMAEMA component taking place along the 2-HEA chains [45,46]."
8,Catalytic performance,"3.3 Catalytic performance To investigate the catalytic performances, the mesoporous silica-supported AgNPs/PDHMS catalyst was initially activated by drying overnight and used for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde under aqueous medium at room temperature. The catalytic system was evaluated using variable parameters, such as oxidants and solvents (Table 2 ). To optimize the reaction conditions, the oxidation reaction was carried using AgNPs/PDHMS as the catalyst, and benzyl alcohol was used as the model compound. The comparison of entries 1–8 in Table 2 suggests that water is a better solvent rather than chlorinated or methanolic solvents to produce higher yield of oxidation of benzyl alcohol when the same amount (1.0 mmol) of oxidants were used for both t-BuOOH and H5IO6 (Table 2, entries 1–3 and entries 6–8). It is also seen that H5IO6 is more promising than other mild oxidizing agents, i.e. hydrogen peroxide and t-BuOOH, to lead to higher yield of oxidation of benzyl alcohol, when comparing entry 3, 4, and 6 in Table 2 when same amounts (1.0 mmol) were used. The same result can be seen from the comparison of entry 1 and 7 as well as 2 and 8, even when the chlorinated or methanolic solvents were used instead of water. In addition, it was found that 1.0 mmol of H5IO6 was sufficient for the maximum conversion (Table 2, entries 5, 6, 9). Regarding the catalyst amount, 0.006 g was sufficient to complete the reaction (Table 2, entries 6, 10, 11). No significant change in the conversion was observed on increasing the amount of the catalyst. In contrast, in the absence of a catalyst, 15% of conversion at room temperature was found (Table 2, entry 12). The nature of the catalyst is investigated further in the following discussion. We conducted experiments using AgNPs/MS without a functionalized polymer, which resulted in moderate conversion (Table 2, entry 13). The yield was significantly lower in the absence of AgNPs in the catalyst PDHMS only (Table 2, entry 14). We checked the catalytic activity of AgNPs/PDH without SBA-15 and compared with AgNPs/PDHMS. In the presence of mesoporous silica support, the catalyst showed much faster oxidation of benzyl alcohol (1 h) with higher yield (99%) (Table 2, entry 10). Meanwhile, in the absence of mesoporous silica support, the catalytic reaction takes much longer time (5 h) with the yield (92%) (Table 2, entry 17). This is mainly due to more doping of AgNPs in the AgNPs/PDHMS as compared with AgNPs/PDH. More AgNPs are occupied in the pores as well as on the surface of mesoporous silica support. Thus, AgNPs/PDHMS displayed higher catalytic activity. To study the effect of copolymer coating, the experiment was conducted with and without 2-HEA monomer at different temperatures. Interestingly, the results indicated the importance of 2-HEA with a slight increase in the conversion after copolymerization at room temperature (Table 2, entries 15 and 16). The thermo-responsive nature of the catalyst was predicted from the DLS measurements with the LCST value (30–35 °C). A few experiments were designed to show different yields below and above the LCST values to confirm the LCST behavior of the catalyst (Table 2). The LCST of AgNPs/PDMS was approximately 45–50 °C. After copolymerization of DMAEMA and 2-HEA on SBA‒15, the LCST decreased to 30–35 °C. Therefore, we tested the oxidation reaction at 25 °C (below LCST) and 50 °C (above LCST) using AgNPs/PDHMS catalyst and found that benzyl alcohol was converted to benzaldehyde with 99% and 94% yield, respectively (Table 2, entries 10 and 18), but profound variation was observed in the time required to complete the reaction. This provides clear evidence that the swelling property was much higher for the catalyst at 25 °C. On swelling, the polymer covered AgNPs/PDHMS expands, which leads to better interaction between the active sites of the catalyst and reactants, resulting in the organic transformation. Above LCST, the polymer shrinks and acts as a wall between the reactants and AgNPs, which affects the rate of reaction. The coil-globule transition of the polymer at different temperatures was the critical factor in the above results [27,30]. DLS studies showed that catalyst swelled significantly at a low pH. The oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol was investigated under acidic conditions to study the pH-responsive environment of the catalyst. The repulsion between the positive charges in NH3 + is large, and the swelling property was enhanced at low pH, which resulted in better conversion (99%) (Table 2, entry 10). The catalytic activity of the prepared AgNPs/PDHMS was further investigated for other chemical conversions under the abovementioned optimized reaction conditions to highlight the excellent applicability of the catalyst for diverse catalytic uses. Therefore, we checked the reactivity of substituted aliphatic and benzylic alcohols to convert to their corresponding aldehydes or ketones. Table 3 shows that aromatic alcohols generally required less reaction time and resulted in good conversion than the aliphatic alcohols (Table 3, entries 1–5). The reason behind this is the better interaction between aromatic alcohols and surface of catalyst through π–π bonding. The detailed mechanism of the above chemical conversion has been reported previously [47–49]. The effect of the electronic properties on the substituents was stronger in the aromatic alcohols than aliphatic alcohols. The obtained isolated yield is low for the compound containing an electron-withdrawing group than that containing electron-releasing group (Table 3, entries 1, 6, and 8). Conversion of 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol to the corresponding aldehyde took place after 4 h, whereas the benzyl alcohol converted within 1 h. Therefore, the electron-withdrawing groups have a negative effect on the conversion and yield of the oxidation reaction. In addition, the aliphatic alcohols were also converted to their corresponding aldehydes at a moderate rate. The rate of conversion increased on lengthening the chain (Table 3, entries 2–4). Karimi et al. have reported the conversion of different substituted aliphatic alcohols to their corresponding aldehydes at 60 °C using toluene as a solvent, but in our case, the reaction was performed at room temperature in the presence of water [47–49]. The ring strain, which facilitated the conversion of cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone, is higher than that of cyclopentanol (Table 3, entries 5 and 9). The heterocyclic alcohols also exhibited high conversion and yield at room temperature using water (Table 3, entry 7) [47–52]. 1H/13C NMR spectra of oxidized products are included in the Supplementary Data (Fig. S6). Turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) values are also included in Table 3. TOF ranged from 4 to 57 for the oxidation of alcohols under aqueous conditions. The TON and TOF values of the AgNPs/PDHMS catalyst were found to be comparable with the corresponding literature values [53]. Table 4 compares the catalytic activity of the catalyst reported herein with previously reported ones, which shows that O2 and air were used as an oxidant in most of previous works, while H51O6 was mainly used as an oxidant in our work. It should be noted that the catalyst in this work proved excellent oxidation (up to 99%) with small amounts of catalyst (6 mg) and quite short reaction time (1 h) at room temperature in comparison to other previously reported catalysts."
9,Reusability of the catalyst,"3.4 Reusability of the catalyst The ability to reuse the catalyst for multiple times is a highly attractive feature; therefore, the recyclability of the AgNPs/PDHMS catalyst was inspected after the oxidation reaction. The catalyst was recycled by washing with water and dried in vacuum at 40 °C for 5 h prior to the next use. Because of the difficulty in identifying the AgNPs leaching from the solid catalyst, we investigated a single reaction by setting a reaction time of 1 h under the same reaction conditions and found a negligible loss in weight of catalyst during each cycle. No significant reduction in the conversion of alcohol to aldehyde was observed in each cycle. Finally, it was found that in five consecutive runs, the recycled catalyst still provided the desired product with a yield ranging from 99% to 80%, suggesting the good reusability of this catalyst for the conversion of alcohol to aldehyde (Fig. 11 ). Wide-angle XRD patterns indicated that there were no changes in the crystallinity of AgNPs after the oxidation reaction, as shown in Fig. S7 FE-TEM analysis clarifies the presence of AgNPs both inside and outside the pores. The black spots indicate the presence of AgNPs (Fig. S8). FT-IR analysis was also conducted after the fifth cycle of the catalyst to investigate the presence of functional groups (Fig. S9). Two weak peaks observed at 2924 and 2990 cm−1 indicated the presence of C–H stretching, which was associated with the aliphatic group. A strong peak at 1725 cm−1, corresponding to the CO group, strongly confirmed that catalyst structure was retained after the synthesis of aldehyde during the reaction. The overall results suggest that the prepared catalyst showed highly robust and stable surface properties, which are very important for use in industrial chemical conversions and for mass production of compounds."
10,Conclusions,"In this study, we developed a novel, AgNPs-based, inorganic/organic hybrid catalyst and studied the functional, structural, and surface properties and their catalytic activity toward the oxidation of alcohol. The stimuli-responsive copolymer was grafted on the SBA‒15 surface through a free radical polymerization reaction. Copolymers of DMAEMA with 2-HEA were synthesized to tune the LCST of the copolymers. The particle size of AgNPs/PDHMS aqueous dispersions decreased from 1093 to 678 nm as the temperature and pH increased. This catalyst showed improved catalytic activity toward the oxidation of alcohol to the aldehyde in aqueous medium below LCST and pKa value of the copolymer. The selectivity toward the corresponding aldehyde was found to be significantly high (99%). The oxidation reaction results indicate that AgNPs/PDHMS can catalyze oxidation reactions under mild, eco-friendly conditions with exceptionally high yield. Moreover, the stable structure of the hybrid catalyst permitted it to be reused for at least more than 5 times in selective oxidation reactions. The main advantages of the hybrid catalyst as compared to the existing catalysts include outstanding alcohol conversion, short reaction time, small necessary amount of catalyst, and performing the catalytic conversion at room temperature using water as a solvent. The above advantages show that the catalyst is environmentally friendly and is highly beneficial for organic conversion under mild reaction conditions."
