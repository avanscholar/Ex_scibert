0,Introduction,"Environmental problem and energy crisis are major factors driving researchers to focus on biogas as alternative renewable and eco-friendly energy instead of fossil fuels (Jin et al., 2021). Due to its advantages of large amount and sustainable generation, lignocellulosic biomass is selected as feedstock for biofuels production (Li et al., 2020). As most widely cultivated crops in China, corn yield was almost as high as 260.7 million tons in 2020 (NBSCNational Bureau of Statistics of China, 2020). The huge amount of corn straw (CS) with high content of lignocellulose could be used as raw materials for biogas production by anaerobic digestion (AD). The components of lignocellulose mainly consist of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin (LCH), which is regarded as material for biogas production since its high carbohydrate content (Cai et al., 2021). However, due to its heterogeneity, crystallinity and high polymerization degree of lignocellulose, the direct utilization by microorganisms is very limited. The pre-treatments of lignocellulosic biomass is proposed to improve biodegradability and methane production by removing lignin, expanding fiber and increasing the accessible surface area of anaerobic microorganisms (Veluchamy and Kalamdhad, 2017). The chemical pre-treatments, such as acid and alkaline, were the most studied method for treating substrates with high lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose content (Sołowski et al., 2020). The effective performance of chemical pre-treatment of NaOH has been widely investigated (Zahoor et al., 2021). Xu et al. (2020) found that the highest methane yield of 260.5 mL CH4 g−1 VS−1 was obtained by modified CS with the black liquor of 12 g NaOH/L alkalinity for 24 h, which increased by 59.1% higher than the unmodified. NaOH pre-treatment was more effective in delignification than other chemical pre-treatment, and the lignin content of CS was reduced by 85.3% (Tan et al., 2019). However, chemical pre-treatments required additional chemical reagents consumption which was unsustainable and not cost-effective. In the biological methods, the hydrolysis and acidification (HA) can convert organic wastes into valuable intermediates like volatile fatty acids (VFAs) from C2 to C6 (acetic, propionic, butyric, etc.), which is a major carbon source for microorganisms to produce methane (Fan et al., 2018). In recent years, the HA process of lignocellulose has attracted much attention, and it can be improved by independently controlling the operation conditions involving the hydrolysis/acidification and methanogenesis, which will enhance the overall methanogenic efficiency of AD (Li et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2019b; Wei et al., 2020). Considering the fact that hemicellulose and cellulose are usually internally encapsulated by lignin and form a stable polymer, there is considerable resistance to the degradation of lignocellulosic biomass, especially in the hydrolysis stage. Many different additives were used in the post-treatment process to improve the HA of lignocellulose, such as high mobility nanobubble water (Wang et al., 2020), rumen fluid (Wang et al., 2018), surfactants (Mei et al., 2017). Although these methods were effective, the methods are characterized by high use of chemicals and high operating costs, which indicated an increase in costs. Therefore, an efficient, economical and eco-friendly sustainable method to improve the HA of CS required further research. As by-product of the biogas plant, liquid fraction of digestate (LFD) usually contains high microorganisms, inorganic substances (ammonia, NO3 −-N and potassium ions) and soluble organic matter (amino acids, proteins and sugars) (Guo et al., 2019). However, only 40–50% of the feedstock is converted to biogas, while the LFD remains unused in the reactor, reducing the efficiency of the AD system. In addition, the organic matter in the LFD is only partially stabilized, which determines odor and leakage problems in field applications (Ketsub et al., 2021). The nitrogen and other inorganic substances of LFD can be used as nutrient for the growth of microorganisms and system stability is enhanced via adjusting substrate C/N (Wei et al., 2020). Whether LFD could be used for CS modification has attracted more and more attentions recently. Liu et al. (2019a) investigated that the effect of LFD soaking pre-treatment of wheat straw on its biogas production efficiency. The results showed that compared to untreated wheat straw, the 5-day LFD soaking pre-treatment group increased its biomethane production by 49.58% within 35.71% of the digestion time (T80). Li et al. (2018) introduced a cascade process and LFD recycle process to achieve a higher methane yield. The results indicated that the LFD recirculation of LFD during cascade process could improve the AD performance of CS. Chen et al. (2020) investigate the effects of LFD recirculation ratio on continuous dry anaerobic digestion. The results showed that the volumetric biogas production rate could reach 1.6 L L−1·d−1 during the 60% LFD recirculation ratio. At present, the application of LFD modification of lignocellulose in AD is still focused on LFD soaking pre-treatment. The weak alkalinity of LFD was mainly used to destroy the lignocellulosic structure in LFD soaking pre-treatment method, however the role of microorganisms in LFD was neglected. The LFD recirculation mainly used nitrogen in LFD effluent to makeup and balanced the C/N in the system by recirculate LFD back into reactor. This research is to simultaneously use LFD to introduce microorganisms to promote the biochemical pathway of lignocellulose degradation during HA instead of just using LFD as chemical soaking reagent or providing nitrogen elements by recirculation. Also, there are few reports on the conversion of acidogenic metabolites of lignocellulose. The metabolites produced by lignocellulose are complex and have different compositions and concentrations. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the metabolic processes involved in the conversion of lignocellulose to VFAs. In such a scenario, this research considered a new process where hydrolysis and acidification based-liquid fraction of digestate (LFD-HA) strategy treating CS to facilitate the degradability and methane conversion efficiency. A post-hydrolysis and acidification (HA) process was applied to treating CS by recirculating LFD to the acidogenic reactor to further solubilize recalcitrant organic polymers. Through combining the LFD and HA modification, the process was upgraded with associated improvement in AD performance. The goals of this study is therefore related to different aspects, namely: (1) to establish a LFD-HA post-treatment process and compare its performance with NaOH pre-treatment; (2) to analyze the composition and physicochemical structure changes of lignocellulose during various modification processes; (3) to evaluate the effect of LFD-HA strategy on the degradation pathway of lignocellulose and microbial community structure."
1,Materials and methods,
2,"Corn straw substrate, inoculum and LFD","2.1 Corn straw substrate, inoculum and LFD The CS samples were taken from farmland in suburbs of Beijing, China. The CS was dried under natural condition, cut into 30–40 mm length with a steel knife (8016, Deli China) and then ground to 20 mesh size with a grinder (YSW-180, Zhengde China). The inoculum was taken from a medium temperature AD digester treated with pig manure in Beijing, China. The LFD was taken from a continuous stirred tank reactor in our lab, which was operated for 1 year with CS as feed. The obtained LFD was filtered through a 5-mesh screen to remove impurities and then stored at 4 °C until use. The initial properties of the original CS and LFD are listed in Table 1 ."
3,Modification methods,"2.2 Modification methods 2.2.1 NaOH modification In the NaOH modification process, ground CS was put in 0.5 L digestor with 2% (w/w) NaOH (analytical reagent, purity≥96.0%; purchased from the Nanjing Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., China) based on the dry weight. The moisture content was adjusted to 88% reported by Zheng et al. (2009). All digestors were performed at ambient temperature (20 ± 2 °C) for 3 days in triplicate and then NaOH modified CS (NaOH CS) samples were obtained. 2.2.2 LFD-HA modification Three 0.5 L reactors were used for the LFD-HA modification. The 40 gTS CS and LFD was loaded into each reactor with TS ratio of 4:1. The mixture was stirred thoroughly by mechanical stirrer with a speed of 100 r min−1. The reactors were purged with nitrogen gas for 5 min and then sealed with a rubber plug to achieve anaerobic conditions. No additional external nutrients or trace elements were added. The reactors were operated in a water bath adjusted at 35 ± 1 °C for 4 days in triplicate and then the LFD-HA modified CS (LFD-HA CS) was obtained. The biogas from reactor was collected by gas bag and then analyzed by GC for gas composition."
4,Methane fermentation experiments,"2.3 Methane fermentation experiments The whole modification process and methane fermentation experimental setup was demonstrated as Fig. 1 . Twelve identical 1 L digestors with a working volume of 0.8 L were used with 100 r min−1 stirrer. Unmodified CS was used for direct fermentation as control. Digesters with LFD as only feed without any CS was also operated as blank to deduct the background effect of LFD. Both NaOH and LFD-HA modification were performed respectively before batch methane fermentation experiments. The anaerobic condition was attained by flushing nitrogen gas and sealing tightly with butyl rubber caps. The organic loading and inoculum were set as 50 g TS L−1 and 15 g MLSS L−1 according to Liu et al. (2019b). LFD-HA CS and NaOH CS obtained as described in section 2.2.1 were put into the reactor and mixed with inoculum. The inoculum was effluent of a medium temperature AD digester treating pig manure in Beijing, China (Table 1). The working volume of all digesters was filled with deionized water to 0.8 L. Daily biogas production was collected for analyze. During fermentation, all tests were performed in triplicate at mesophilic of 35 ± 1 °C for 60 days."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods 2.4.1 Physicochemical properties analysis The methane content of biogas was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (SP-2100, BeiFenRuiLi, Beijing, China). The determination of TS, VS, MLSS and MLVSS were calculated according to the standard methods (Eaton et al., 1966). Elemental composition (C, N, H and S) was analyzed by Vario EL/micro cube elemental analyzer (Elementar, Germany). Lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose contents were determined using fiber analyzer (A2000I, ANKOM, USA) (Van Soest et al., 1991). VFAs were measured by a gas chromatograph (SHIMADZU, GC2014). Structural changes on the physical surface of CS were revealed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Hitachi S-4700, Japan). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were analyzed by a FTIR spectrophotometer (Nicolet 5DXC, USA) using a KBr disk containing 1% finely ground samples. A total of 30 scans were taken with a resolution of 4 cm−1. The liquid products after modified were detected by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) (Trace 1300 GC-ISO, Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with DB-5MS column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm). The degraded compounds were compared with the mass spectra of the National Institute of Standards and Technology mass spectrometry library at the corresponding retention times (RT) to determine their identity. The reagents used in the study included concentrated sulfuric acid (analytical reagent, 98%; purchased from Beijing Tongguang Fine Chemical Co. Ltd., China), ethyl acetate (chromatographically pure, 99.9%; Jiangsu Aikang Biomedical R&D Co. Ltd., China) and phosphoric acid (analytical reagent, purity 85%; purchased from Shanghai Marel Chemical Technology Co. Ltd., China). The other chemicals were of chemical reagent grade. 2.4.2 Modified Gompertz model Modified Gompertz model was used to describe and predict the maximum methane yield potential, as shown in Eq. (1) (Elbeshbishy et al., 2012). (1) P ( t ) = P m ⋅ exp { − exp [ R m ⋅ e P m ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } Where P(t) represents methane yield per gram VS (mL g−1VS−1), Pm is the maximum methane yield (mL g−1 VS−1), Rm stands for the maximum methane production rate (mL g−1 VS−1 d−1), λ refers to the lag phase time (d), t means the digestion time (d) and e is equal to 2.72. 2.4.3 Biodegradability calculation The organic fractions of the CS could be defined as the molecular formula of CnHaObNc. The theoretical methane yield (TMY) is the maximum produced CH4 volume estimated by the Buswell formula, as showed in Eqs. (2) and (3) (Yang et al., 2017). Biodegradability is defined as the specific value produced by experimental methane yield (EMY) (mLg−1 VS−1) and TMY, as shown in Eq. (4). (2) C n H a O b N c + y H 2 O → x C H 4 + ( n − x ) C O 2 + c N H 3 Where y=(4n-a-2b+3c)/4, and x=(4n+a-2b-3c)/8. (3) TMY ( mL CH 4 gVS ) = 2.8 × 1000 × ( 4 n + a − 2 b − 3 c ) 12 n + a + 16 b + 14 c (4) Biodegradability (%) = EMY/TMY × 100% 2.4.4 Energy production efficiency The energy production efficiency (EPE) was calculated by dividing combustion value of H2 and CH4 experimentally produced from CS by the combustion value of theoretically calculated CH4. The combustion values of H2 and CH4 are 10.78 J mL−1 and 35.9 J mL−1, respectively. So, EPE of CS could be calculated based on experimental energy yield (EEY) and theoretical energy yield (TEY) (Eq. (5)) (Yuan et al., 2009): (5) EPE = EEY TEY = V H 2 × 10.78 + V CH 4 × 35.9 TMY × 35.9 × 100 % Where VH2 and VCH4 referred to the volume of H2 and CH4 experimentally produced from CS respectively. 2.4.5 Microbial community analyses The community of the suspended sludge in acidogenic reactor of the LFD, CS, NaOH CS and LFD-HA CS and methanogenic reactor of LFD-HA CS (represented as R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5, respectively) was analyzed by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing based on the Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina Company, USA). The genomic DNA of the sludge samples was extracted using an extraction kit named FastDNA Spin Kit (MP Biomedicals, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For real-time PCR assays, ABI GeneAmp® 9700 (ABI, USA) with TransStart Fastpfu DNA Polymerase (TransGen AP221-02, China) and an AxyPrep DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Axygen, USA) were used. The PCR primers are Universal Primers for bacteria, 338F (50-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-30) and 806R (50-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-30), and for archaea, 524F10ext (50-TGYCAGCCG. CCGCGGTAA-30) and Arch958Rmod (50YCCGGC GTTGAVTCCAATT-30). 2.4.6 Statistical analyses The average of the three replicate sample measurements was used as the analysis result. The one way analysis of variance were calculated by Excel 2016（Microsoft, USA). Graph and data processing were performed with OriginPro 8.0 (OriginLab, USA)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effects of LFD-HA modification on methane production efficiency,"3.1 Effects of LFD-HA modification on methane production efficiency 3.1.1 Methane production Daily methane production (DMP) and cumulative methane yield (CMY) of the samples with various modification were shown in Fig. 2 . As shown in Fig. 2(a), three peaks and a similar variation trend were observed for the DMP of different groups, however with different peak values and time of appearance. Three main biogas production peaks were widely reported during lignocellulosic biomass AD, which was divided by HA phase, the first methane production phase and the second methane production phase (Liu et al., 2018). For unmodified CS and NaOH CS, the first DMP peak appeared between day 1 and day 5, and DMP approached to zero during the day 5 to day 15 due to the VFAs accumulation. Then, the DMP increased gradually and the later two peaks appeared nearby day 20 and day 30 respectively by the reason that methanogens self-recovered after the HA phase. As for LFD-HA CS, no time lag was observed and its second DMP peak showed up 10 days and 11 days earlier than NaOH CS and CS, respectively. In addition, LFD was observed to produce almost no biogas, indicating that the methane increase was on account of the higher biodegradability after LFD-HA modification, rather than from LFD. The highest DMP peaks were 828.0 and 600.0 mL for LFD-HA CS and NaOH CS, which were 49.46% and 8.30% higher than that of unmodified one (554.0 mL). The CMY of all samples was shown in Fig. 2(b), both LFD-HA and NaOH attained more CMY than unmodified CS while the CMY of LFD was almost zero. The CMY of LFD-HA CS increased rapidly to 232.0 mL g−1 VS−1 during day 1–30 and the CMY increased slowly to 265.1 mL g−1 VS−1 from day 31 to day 51. The DMP decreased to 0 mL after day 51 due to the less substrate, so the CMY of LFD-HA CS after day 51 remained constant. On the other hand, the CMY of NaOH CS and unmodified CS began to rapidly increase after day 15, much slower than LFD-HA. The highest CMY achieved by LFD-HA CS was 265.1 mL g−1 VS−1, which was 53.2% higher than the unmodified CS (173.1 mL g−1 VS−1). The statistical analysis showed that the differences were significant for LFD-HA CS and unmodified CS group (p < 0.01); however, no noticeable difference was observed between NaOH CS and unmodified CS group (p > 0.05). Due to the enzyme activity, VFAs accumulation and microbial community differences caused by the modification method, significant differences in CMY between the LFD-HA CS and the NaOH CS group were found. The NaOH CS showed 23.9% higher CMY than that of unmodified CS, which was in accordance with the conclusion reported by Zheng et al. (2009). Methane yield of LFD-HA CS achieved in this study is a comparable result with the reported value (242.0 mL g−1 VS−1) using LFD pre-treatment (Wei et al., 2020). Studies have shown that a combination of Ca(OH)2 hydrolysis and steam explosion can increase the efficiency of AD of CS, with a 61.54% increase in methane production (Ji et al., 2017). Xu et al. (2018) carried out mesophilic anaerobic digestion with microaerobic pretreatment of maize stover and achieved a methane yield of 270.80 mL g−1 VS−1, only 17.35% more than untreated. Li et al. (2019) used a freeze-thaw process to pretreat CS for 21 days in winter and increased methane yield by 40.5%. Therefore, modification of straw using the LFD-HA strategy is comparable both in terms of methane yield or increase rate. However, these treatment techniques required high temperatures of 250 °C and high pressures (1.5 MPa) or long processing times, resulting in significant energy consumption and the production of large amounts of fermentation inhibiting substances. In the current study, modification of CS using LFD-HA strategy has the advantages of easy scalability, low energy consumption and high performance (53.2% increase in methane production), making it highly competitive and advantageous in practical applications. 3.1.2 Modelling calculation and kinetics analysis Modified Gompertz model was used based on the experimental CMY data. As shown in Table 2 , R2 between 0.993 and 0.998 indicates nice fitting of Gompertz equation. The Rm, which represented the methane production rate and velocity of substrate degradation, was 87.9 mL g−1 VS−1 d−1 for the LFD-HA CS, 31.1% and 53.7% higher than NaOH CS and CS respectively. The change trends of predicted CMY (Pm) were similar to that of Rm, the Pm was increased from 175.2 mL g−1 VS−1 to 269.4 mL g−1 VS−1 after LFD-HA process, which is substantially in agreement with the experimental results (Fig. 2(b)). The digestion time produced 80% of the total methane production (T80) is used to compare the effectiveness of AD system (Palmowski and Müller, 2000). The smaller T80 means the higher the biogas production efficiency and accordingly lower financial cost. T80 for LFD-HA CS, NaOH CS and CS was the 26th, 34th and 36th day, respectively. T80 of the LFD-HA CS was 27.8% and 23.5% shorten than unmodified CS and NaOH CS, showing its potential to accelerate AD process and improve efficiency. The index λ describes the rate at which microorganisms use intermediates (mainly VFAs) via biogas conversion or microorganisms utilization, representing the delayed reaction of microorganisms and their subsequent adaptability. The effective methanogenesis cycle (Tef) can be calculated by subtracting the lag phase λ from T80, which is the actual methane production time during the entire AD process (Mao et al., 2017). The simulation results observed the opposite trend of λ and Tef value observed with μm. The λ in the LFD-HA CS group decreased from 13.9 d to 6.2 d, and the Tef decreased from 22 d to 20 d. The results showed that both λ and Tef of NaOH CS and unmodified CS were longer than LFD-HA CS demonstrating more readily biodegradable after LFD-HA modification. The biodegradability of the substrate in LFD-HA CS was 61.5%, 23.5% and 53.4% higher over the NaOH CS and unmodified CS respectively. In addition, the CMY of LFD-HA CS and NaOH CS are directly proportional to the biodegradability, which is in line with the report of Kim et al. (2019). The observation showed that the lignocellulose after LFD-HA had low degradation resistance and was easily converted to methane. 3.1.3 Energy production efficiency The EPE was defined as the ratio of the actual energy value produced by CS and the theoretically calculated maximum value. Combined production energy of hydrogen and methane is considered in calculation. The elemental composition of CS was summarized in Table 1. The organic fraction of CS was represented as C75.8 H126.8O59.4N. The theoretical stabilization of CS in this study can be written as C75.8H126.8O59.4N+15.15H2O→38.525 CH4+37.275CO2+NH3. Stabilization of 1 g of VS has the potential for production of 431.3 mL CH4. Besides methanogenesis, organic matter is also used for anaerobic microbial growth. From methane yield in Table 2, closer values with theoretical methanogenic potential were observed of LFD-HA CS. The EPE of CS can be calculated based on TEY and EEY as shown in Eq. (5). Where, the combustion values of H2 and CH4 were 10.8 J mL−1 and 35.9 J mL−1, respectively. The EPE calculated according to EEY and TEY was shown in Table 3 . The methane yield of unmodified CS was 173.1 mL g−1 VS−1. According to the per gram VS theoretical methane combustion value (15483.7 J g−1 VS−1), the EPE of unmodified CS was 40.1%. In LFD-HA CS, the methane and hydrogen yield during LFD-HA was 8.0 and 8.5 mL g−1 VS−1, respectively (Table 3). The EPE of LFD-HA CS (64.0%) was 59.6% and 28.8% higher than the unmodified and NaOH CS, respectively. The EPE of LFD-HA CS was comparable to the findings of previous study, which reported that the EPE of the steam explosion modified CS, lettuce wastes and banyan leaves were 54.1%, 28.8% and 8.8% respectively (Li et al., 2010). It further demonstrated that LFD-HA can significantly improve EPE of lignocellulose, which is an effective way to enhance the AD performance of CS."
8,Analysis of modified corn straw characteristic,"3.2 Analysis of modified corn straw characteristic 3.2.1 Main composition analysis of modified corn straw The main characteristics of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose (LCH) compositions and VFAs concentration of CS after various treatment processes were shown in Fig. 3 . LFD-HA modification demonstrated better performance than NaOH. After LFD-HA modification, the content of the cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin decreased from 34.2%, 31.3% and 8.4%–30.7%, 24.3% and 7.1% respectively (Fig. 3(a)). The total LCH and lignin removal rate of LFD-HA CS were 19.1% and 18.4%, which were 69.8% and 174.2% higher than NaOH CS respectively. The higher lignin removal was critical for CS digestion efficiency considering complex lignin-carbohydrate bonds (e.g. α-ether bonds, ester bonds, phenyl glycosidic bonds and acetal bonds) hinder anaerobic microorganisms degradation. The ratio of lignin to cellulose (L/C) was usually used to assess biodegradability (Scharer and Moo-Young, 1979). The L/C ratio of LFD-HA CS (23.2%) was also lower than NaOH (23.8%), indicating improved biodegradability. LFD-HA modification also promote CS hydrolysis with more VFAs generation via HA process. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the unmodified CS had a little VFAs concentration of 106.5 mg L−1. However, the VFAs of LFD-HA CS and NaOH CS were 8398.0 and 1599.8 mg L−1, which were 78.9 and 15.0 times higher than that of unmodified CS, respectively. More specifically, the VFAs of the unmodified CS was mainly ethanol original from inoculum. In contrast, LFD-HA CS and NaOH CS promoted high total content of acetic acid and ethanol (55.0%–95.6%). Moreover, LFD-HA demonstrated additional butyric and propionic acids production. After the LFD-HA modification, the lignin in CS was degraded, and cellulose and hemicellulose could be released and converted into VFAs, which may improve the efficiency of subsequent methane fermentation. 3.2.2 Surface morphology analysis of modified corn straw The variation of the surface morphology and microstructure of CS before and after various modifications were observed by SEM as shown in Fig. S1. The unmodified sample demonstrated smooth and complete surface. It was the tight structure of lignocellulose with many fibrous layers arranged that induced obstacle to microbial degradation (Van Soest et al., 1991). However, the complete surface was destroyed by modification processes. The surface of NaOH CS appeared rough and rugged, showing the cell wall of lignocellulose was cracked to certain extent. Also, more obvious structure variation was observed after LFD-HA modification. The surface of LFD-HA CS shown loose structure and higher surface area with partially destroyed lignocellulosic alignment. It became more porous with the morphology of honeycomb due to the partial removal of lignin after treatment. As surface areas increased, more LHC could be exposed to microorganism and the subsequent AD performance was further facilitated. 3.2.3 FTIR spectra analysis of modified corn straw The changes of the functional groups in structure of hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin were observed by the characteristic absorbance peaks of FTIR spectrum, which showed the removal or decrement of some functional groups from the components (Fig. 4 ). FTIR results indicated that the linkage bands of aromatic rings and methomyls (-OCH3) in lignin structure was damaged during the both two modifications. The intensity of peaks at 1604, 1510 and 1425 cm−1, which were attributed to aromatic benzene ring stretching (Martin et al., 2011) was significantly decreased after NaOH and LFD-HA treatments. The peak at 1460 cm−1, which represented methoxyl stretching, also decreased obviously after LFD-HA. The peaks at 1375 and 1160 cm−1 of LFD-HA CS, related to ester bonds in lignin-carbohydrate complexes (LCC) structure, decreased distinctly. Meanwhile, it was observed that the absorption at 1248 cm−1 was diminished after LFD-HA modification, which was indicative of the ether bond stretching of LCC structure (Liu et al., 2009). The broad peak at 3000–3500 cm−1 attributes to the –OH stretching that indicates the presence of chemical compounds with hydroxyl functional groups (Liew et al., 2018). The peaks at 1050 cm−1 and 3421 cm−1 are related to the stretching of CO and-OH group in carbohydrate structure, respectively. The peak at 898 cm−1 means β-(1 → 4)-glycosidic linkages, connecting β-D glucose group (D-xylopyranose group) to form cellulose (hemicellulose) linear polymer compound (Gia-Luen et al., 2008). After LFD-HA modification, the decreasing of these peaks indicated that the modification had an effect on damaging the internal linkages of cellulose or hemicellulose, such as hydrogen bond and β-(1 → 4)-glycosidic linkages. In summary, benzene ring, ether bond, hydrogen bond and β-(1 → 4)-glycosidic bond are important bonds in lignocellulose structure, which can be damaged after LFD-HA. Hence, LFD-HA modification would release cellulose and hemicellulose and improve its biodegradability effectively. 3.2.4 GC-MS spectra analysis of modified corn straw In order to further determine the degradation mechanism of lignocellulose modified by NaOH and LFD-HA, intermediate and final products during degradation were extracted with ethyl acetic and identified. The total ion flow diagram of NaOH CS and LFD-HA CS was in shown in Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Material. The substantial difference in pattern of the obtained compounds were observed and LFD-HA led to more obvious structural damage of lignocellulose. It was demonstrated that main final products of NaOH CS included some long-chain aliphatic compounds (heptaethylene glycol monododecyl ether, RT 22.99 min) and polyphenyl aromatic macro compounds (chlorotetracycline, RT 24.64 min) in Fig. S2(a). In contrast, a large number of low molecular aliphatic compounds and aromatic compounds such as toluene and hydrogenated cinnamic acid were identified in the acidified liquid extract of LFD-HA process, indicating that the lignin structural damage of lignocellulose by LFD-HA (Fig. S2(b)). The sinapyl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol and p-coumaryl alcohol are precursors of p-hydroxyphenyl structure lignin, guaiacol structure lignin and syringyl structure lignin, respectively. The three lignols are oxidized to form the corresponding sinapic acid, ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid. The sinapic acid undergoes dehydroxylation and demethylation to form cinnamic acid (Xu et al., 2007). The three lignin monomer model compounds of sinapyl alcohol, ferulic alcohol and coumarin were not found in the degraded sample, confirming that LFD-HA modification could also degrade the lignin-derived aromatic monomer compound. The structure of hydrogenated cinnamic acid is similar to that of cinnamic acid (Fig. S3 (a)), so that the hydrogenation reaction of cinnamic acid is initially determined. After acidification, no diphenyl ring compound was detected, indicating that the lignin macromolecular fragment was degraded into a monophenyl ring type small molecule compound. As shown in Fig. S3(b) and Fig. S3(c), p-toluene and acetic acid were detected in LFD-HA CS, which may be substances produced during the decarboxylation of cinnamic acid. Based on the above experimental results, it is speculated that the degradation pathway of lignin as shown in Fig. S4. The lignin precursor was firstly degraded to cinnamic acid. The cinnamic acid was converted to hydrogenated cinnamic acid by hydrogenation, and converted to acetic acid and p-toluene by further decarboxylation. Chen et al. (2012) reported that catalase and laccase secreted by unicellular bacteria could degrade, mineralize and dissolve lignin. Comamonas sp. UVS can secrete catalase and laccase (Jadhav et al., 2008), involved in the Protoca-techuate (lignin-related compound) 4, 5-cleavage pathway gene reported in Comamonas testosterone BR6020 ( Providenti et al., 2001). However, few reports focused on the degradation of lignin by HA bacteria of LFD were reported. The determination of low molecular weight compounds such as monomeric benzenes was the direct evidence of the depolymerization and degradation of lignin by HA bacteria in LFD. This research demonstrated LFD-HA modification could degrade lignin monomer compound from the macromolecular polymer into low molecular weight aromatic compounds and acetic acid."
9,Effects of modification on the degradation pathway of corn straw,"3.3 Effects of modification on the degradation pathway of corn straw Based on the analysis of FTIR and GC-MS, the possible degradation pathway for lignin, LCC and carbohydrate structure during NaOH and LFD-HA modification was demonstrated in Fig. 5 . During LFD-HA modification, enzymes such as catalase catalyzed the lignin benzene ring to undergo electron oxidation reaction, form phenoxy radical and further be degraded to small molecules, with complex concurrent reactions including methoxy desorption, carbonyl breakage and benzene ring cleavage (Jiang, 2001). In contrast, during NaOH treatment, nucleophilic substitution reaction occurred when hydroxide ion attacked lignin structure and removed –OCH3 (He et al., 2008). It should be noted that lignin integrate structure was damaged by NaOH modification, however, the fundamental structure of benzene ring was not been broken completely. It also explained that the intensity of these peaks in LFD-HA was lower than NaOH in 3.2.3 results. Generally, lignin was associated in complexes cross-bridged structure of carbohydrate-ester-ferulic acid-ether-lignin. It was inferred that the ferulic acid esterase and p-coumaric acid esterase secreted by anaerobic microorganisms hydrolyzed the ester bond and ether bond in carbohydrate-ester-ferulic acid-ether-lignin structure and leading to more decomposing of the hemicellulose, cellulose and cinnamic acid (Benito Martin et al., 2017). Then, the cinnamic acid was converted to acetic acid and p-toluene by further decarboxylation. It should be noted that NaOH modification also hydrolyzed ester bond by saponification reaction, however, did not damage ether bond effectively Cellulose is a linear macromolecule consisting of many D-glucopyranose anhydrides (1–5) linked to each other by β-(1 → 4)-glycosidic bond. The –OH groups in the macromolecule of cellulose or hemicellulose structure can form hydrogen bond when the distance between the hydrogen atom and the adjacent oxygen atom is less 0.28–0.30 nm. The hydrogen bond is one of the reasons for the lower availability of the anaerobic bacteria to the carbohydrate. Thus, inter- and intramolecular bonds of cellulose and hemicellulose are broken by modification methods. Hence, LFD-HA modification can release more carbohydrate and organic acids than NaOH with better improved degradability by the degradation of lignin, LCC and carbohydrate structure."
10,Effects of LFD-HA modification on microbial community structure,"3.4 Effects of LFD-HA modification on microbial community structure 3.4.1 Bacterial community structure The bacterial community in samples of LFD (R1), CS (R2), NaOH CS (R3), LFD-HA CS of acidogenic reactor (R4) and LFD-HA CS of methanogenic reactor (R5) were analyzed using high-throughput pyrosequencing. The functional microbial communities, hydrolytic bacteria including Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi and Actinobacteria, significantly influenced the durability and productivity of HA (Wei et al., 2020). As displayed in Fig. 6 (a), the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were highest among all the digestors. As syntrophic bacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes could secrete various lytic enzymes capable of degrading organic matter into acetic acid, the relative abundance of which are positively associated with the production of VFAs during HA process and eventual methane production (Liu et al., 2018). Siqi et al. (2018) showed that the abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes was higher in the acidification stage when clippings were fermented with rumen fluid. The relative abundance sum of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in R4 was as high as 91.8%, indicating that the main HA process was run in the reactor. Moreover, the abundance sum of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in R5, R1, R3 and R2 were 62.0%, 45.7%, 48.6% and 35.0% respectively, indicating that the LFD-HA process improved the ability of bacteria to hydrolyze lignocellulose. Proteobacteria remained constant of 2.7% in R4 and 1.9% in R5 respectively, which could convert propionate acid to acetate acid and form a syntrophic metabolism relationship with methanogens (Liu et al., 2019b). As shown in Fig. 6(c), the main bacteria of R4 at the family level was Prevotella, Veillonellacae and Lactobacillaceae, which accounted for 34.0%, 31.4% and 11.7% respectively. The abundance of theses bacteria in R1 was low, indicating that HA process played a key role in the change of microbial community composition in LFD. Prevotella belonged to Bacteroidetes, which could promote carbohydrate and protein degradation. Ueki et al. (2007) found that Prevotella could use a variety of carbohydrate including xylan, xylose, pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose to produce acetic acid, propionic acid, succinic acid and a small amount of malic acid. In addition, Prevotella was an acid-tolerant bacterium with a low pH in the acid-producing phase, which was very suitable for its growth and colonization (Shen et al., 2013). Lactobacillus was suitable for growing in acidic environment, so its proportion in R4 was also prominent (12%). According to the analysis of main composition (3.1.1), it could be known that main metabolic products had acetic acid, butyric acid, and lactic acid, which was consistent with the metabolic pathways of different bacteria (Zhou et al., 2018). Lactic acid and ethanol might come from the metabolic process of acid production by Lactobacillus; butyric acid and other VFAs might come from Veillonellacae, which is a kind of glucose-using anaerobic bacterium with fermentation products consisting of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and valeric acid (Carlier et al., 2002). The main dominant flora of R5 was Ruminococcaceae with a relative abundance of 17.7%. Ruminococcaceae isolated from the rumen are capable of hydrolyzing cellulosic biomass to d-galactitol and glutamate, with the end products of hydrogen and VFAs (Liu, 2012). VadinHA17_c_norank (9.5%) was also important acid-producing microorganisms of R5, the main function of which was to degrade the carbohydrate of macromolecules into acetic acid, formic acid, lactic acid and ethanol (Holmes et al., 2007). 3.4.2 Archaea community structure The distributions of archaeal communities are shown in Fig. 6(b) and (d). Euryarchaeota dominated in all samples with a relative abundance over 80% at the phylum level (Fig. 6(b)). Similarly (Li et al., 2018), also observed that Euryarchaeota was the predominant phylum in the CSTR reactor, which accounted for 90–98% of the total archaeal communities. As shown in Fig. 6(d), Methanobacteriaceae, Methanosaetaceae and Methanosarcinaceae were the dominant genera. The relative abundances of Methanobacteriaceae (hydrogentrophic methanogens) and Methanosarcinaceae (multifunctional methanogen) in R5 (65.6% and 7.7%) were significantly higher than R3 (46.2% and 2.8%) and R2 (45.9% and 1.2%). This result indicating that LFD-HA was beneficial to the transformation of methane, which could perform both acetolactic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (Placidi et al., 2017). Moreover, norank_p_Bathyarchaeota can be symbiotic with methanogenic bacteria, increasing methane production (Evans et al., 2015), which was also one of the reasons for the increase in acetic acid content in acidogenic reactor of LFD-HA."
11,Practical application and future research prospects,"The LFD-HA modified CS strategy can not only reduce the fermentation time but also increase the degradation of organic matters and methane production. Therefore, LFD microorganisms and the key enzymes for acetic acid synthesis and propionic acid conversion during HA stage should be further analyzed. In addition, energy balance should also be evaluated. In order to better understand these mechanisms, elemental mass balances and chemical reactions at the molecular level through nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy should be analyzed, which will provide insight into the transformation of substances. In particular, the development of novel reactors suitable for integrated high solid lignocellulose HA and LFD recycling technologies is important for the large-scale application of bioenergy production from agricultural waste. The application of this technology will not only provide more biofuels or bioproducts, but will also protect the environment by reducing solid waste. It is also a promising option for developing countries to deal with the problem of agricultural waste."
12,Conclusion,"Strategy of enhanced hydrolysis and acidification by liquid fraction of digestate (LFD-HA) for improving methane production of corn straw were investigated. The methane yield of LFD-HA CS was 265.1 mL g−1 VS−1, 53.1% higher than unmodified CS. The functional groups of lignin, carbohydrate and LCC were destroyed, causing chemical and intramolecular chemical structural changes. The GC-MS analysis showed that three-dimensional network lignin structure was broke into aromatic compounds and acetic acid after LFD-HA. The abundance of Ruminococcaceae, Methanobacteriaceae and Methanosarcinaceae communities were enhanced by LFD-HA. The results revealed the potential of LFD-HA strategy for enhanced corn straw methane production."
