0,Introduction,"Wastes from electrical and electronic equipment are the fastest growing waste category [1]. Thus, recycling of electronic waste is an important subject not only from the point of waste treatment but also from the recovery aspect of valuable materials. Because of the value and the increasing demand for gold, the recovery of gold from secondary sources (such as waste catalysts and computer circuit boards) has been greatly encouraged [2,3]. Pyrometallurgical processing has been widely used to recycle gold from electronic wastes. In recent years, many studies have been focused on hydrometallurgy with acidic solutions which is an interesting alternative [4]. In consequence, many extractants, for instance, amide derivatives [5,6], sulfur-containing reagents [7] and calixarene derivatives [8,9] have been used in solvent extraction systems for the recovery of gold from hydrochloric acid media. However, these extractants are limited in terms of their hydrophobicity and selectivity for Au(III). Microemulsions, which are made from water, a surfactant, an organic solvent and occasionally an alcohol as a cosurfactant, have been widely used in extraction of metallic ions, such as copper [10], lanthanides [11], gallium [12], chromium and other metals [13–15]. In a Winsor II system, the microemulsion consists of an aqueous pool surrounded by surfactant in the oil membrane, in equilibrium with excess aqueous phase. There are several advantages to the use of microemulsion liquid membranes over the conventional liquid-liquid extraction systems [16]. The extraction of metal ions by w/o microemulsion systems often effectively accelerates the extraction as well as improves the extractatability because of the enormous rise of the micro-interfacial surface area and the spontaneous formation of microemulsion globules. The globules can transport metal ions from the aqueous phase to the organic phase. In our previous studies, Winsor II microemulsions with different surfactants were found to effectively extract of uranium, samarium and cobalt [17–20]. To our knowledge, no one has investigated the use of Winsor II microemulsion to extract of Au(III). The purpose of the present work is to use w/o microemulsions for the extraction of gold from hydrochloric acid solutions. There are several advantages with the use of microemulsion liquid membrane over the conventional liquid–liquid extraction system: experimental convenience, easy and safe methodology for extraction of gold in hydrochloric acid solutions. The extraction of Au(III) can be greatly enhanced by the formation of a w/o microemulsion in n-heptane, equilibrated with an aqueous Na2SO3 solution and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as cationic surfactant. The extraction is very effective which can explain by the spontaneous formation of microemulsion globules and the enormous rise of the micro-interfacial surface area."
1,Experimental,
2,Reagents and materials,"2.1 Reagents and materials All of these chemicals except polyaluminum chloride (technical pure) were of analytical reagent grade and were used without further purification. The feed solution was prepared by dissolved chloroauric acid (HAuCl4·4H2O) in hydrochloric acid solution (2M), which contained 0.05gL−1 gold. The electronic waste was kindly supplied free of charge by a gold-recovery industrial company (Shaodong, Hunan, southern China)."
3,Procedure,"2.2 Procedure 2.2.1 Extraction of Au(III) In the following studies, unless stated specially, the temperature was generally maintained at 298±1K. The organic phase was prepared by injecting CTAB, Na2SO3 solution, iso-amyl alcohol and n-heptane (the concentration of inner aqueous Na2SO3 solution is 0.05M and the volume ratio of iso-amyl alcohol in microemulsion is 30%). The procedure of metal extraction into microemulsion system is the same as for ordinary solvent extraction experiment. The two phases shaked mechanically in orbital shaker (Yancheng Science Instrument Factory) for 8min and the volume ratio of aqueous phase to microemulsion was expressed as R (R =8). Afterwards, the microemulsion phase and the aqueous phase were separated using centrifuger (TDL 80-2B, Shanghai Anting Science Instrument Factory) at 2500rpm for 5min. The Au(III) concentration in aqueous solution was measured by UV grating spectrophotometer 754 Type (Shanghai Third Analysis Instrument Factory) and the Au(III) concentration in organic solution was calculated by mass balance. 2.2.2 Recovery of gold from electronic waste In the present work, aqua regia leaching was selected for dissolving of gold from electronic waste [21,22]. At first, 20g of crushed electronic waste was digested using 50mL aqua regia at 90°C for 2h. This was subsequently analyzed for Cu, Ni, Zn, Fe, Sn, Pb, Cr and Au by atomic absorption spectrometry (HP 3510). The processes of recovery gold were as follows: 20g of crushed samples were leaching with nitric acid solution ( V HNO 3 : V H 2 O = 1 : 3 ) for 2h in order to remove silver and base metals. After filtration, the solid was digested up to 90°C with 10mL aqua regia for dissolving metallic gold. The aqua regia was diluted to 500mL with 2M HCl solution to achieve an effective gold extraction. The extraction used the optimized parameters from Section 2.2.1 and concentrations of gold were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry (HP 3510). 2.2.3 Treatment of CTAB wastewater by Fenton oxidation combined with chemical coagulation The Fenton oxidation experiments were carried out with magnetic stirring. Initially, the pH of the CTAB wastewater was adjusted to 3 by addition of aqueous NaOH. Then 200mL of a solution containing the desired concentrations of CTAB, FeSO4·7H2O and 30% hydrogen peroxide were added to a 500mL flask. When Fenton oxidation was completed, adjusted the pH of the wastewater to 8, and the chemical coagulation was performed in the same reactor. In the chemical coagulation process, 200mgL−1 polyaluminum chloride (PAC) was added with 150rpm mixing speed for 2min. This was followed by addition of 5mgL−1 polyacrylamide (PAM) and the aqueous mixture was mixed at 50rpm for 4min. Then the solution stood for 30min to settle out the flocs. After Fenton oxidation and chemical coagulation, the CTAB concentration was determined by spectrophotometry."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Effect of extraction time,"3.1 Effect of extraction time Prior to the batchwise extraction experiment, the extraction rates of gold with CTAB/n-heptane/iso-amyl alcohol/Na2SO3 microemulsion was preliminarily measured so as to establish the optimum time required to attain equilibrium. With using the aqueous phase of 0.05gL−1 gold (III) in 2M HCl solutions and the organic phase of 0.05M CTAB, the influence of equilibrium time on gold extraction was studied (not shown). The vibration time was varied from 0.5 to 20min. The extraction percentage of Au(III) reaches 96% within 1min of contact, which means the extraction equilibrium is immediately achieved and the extraction percentage of gold is not dependent upon the shaking time."
6,Effect of CTAB concentration,"3.2 Effect of CTAB concentration The effect of the CTAB concentration of microemulsion on the gold extraction yield (E%) was investigated. The results were shown in Fig. 1 . The gold extraction yield (E%) increased with CTAB concentration. The amount of microemulsion produced increased with increasing surfactant (CTAB) concentration which could accelerates the extraction and improves the extractatability of Au(III). The complexation of the extracted Au(III) by CTAB/n-heptane/iso-amyl alcohol/Na2SO3 microemulsion was also studied. By plotting the logarithm of the Au(III) distribution ratio (D) as a function of the logarithm of CTAB concentration, a straight line (R 2 =0.99) is obtained, as shown in Fig. 2 . The slope of this line is 1.017, which is close to 1. As reviewed in multiple publications [5,20], quaternary ammonium extractants can extract metal ions by two mechanisms, namely by addition reactions or anion exchange. Therefore and based on slope analysis of the experimental results, the extraction of gold from hydrochloric acid solutions is accepted as the formation of the neutral solvate adduct complex as AuCl4 −CTAB+. Accordingly, the extraction reaction of Au by CTAB/n-heptane/iso-amyl alcohol/Na2SO3 microemulsion can be given as the following equilibrium: (1) HAuCl4·4H2O aq ⇆AuCl4 − aq +4H2O+H+ aq (2) AuCl4 − aq +(R–N)+Br− or ⇆(R–N)+AuCl4 − or +Br− aq Therefore, the distribution ratio (D) of Au can be written as: (3) D ( Au ) = A u o r A u a q = [ [ R N ] AuCl 4 ] o r [ AuC l 4 − ] a q"
7,Effect of temperature,"3.3 Effect of temperature From the viewpoint of thermodynamics, extraction of Au(III) can be regarded as a transfer process of Au(III) from the aqueous phase to the microemulsion phase. To calculate the thermodynamic characteristics, equilibrium constants were determined at different temperatures. In this case, the extraction equilibrium is written as Eq. (2). The equilibrium constant at specific temperatures for the complexation of AuCl4 − with CTAB is: (4) K e x ( T ) = [ [ R N ] AuCl 4 ] o r [ B r − ] a q [ [ R N ] Br ] o r [ AuC l 4 − ] a q Substituting Eq. (3) into Eq. (4), the equilibrium constant, K ex (T), can be written as: (5) K e x ( T ) = D [ B r − ] a q [ [ R N ] Br ] o r The logK ex (T) values for Au(III) in CTAB/n-heptane/iso-amyl alcohol/Na2SO3 microemulsion can be calculated using the extraction data and the following equations derived from Eq. (5): (6) log K e x ( T ) = log D + log [ B r − ] a q − log [ [ R N ] Br ] o r (7) log D = log [ [ R N ] Br ] o r + log K e x ( T ) − log [ B r − ] a q The determined logK ex (T) values in the microemulsion system were listed in Table 1 . Using the equation for Gibbs energy (8) Δ G 0 = − R T ln K e x ( T ) and: (9) Δ G 0 = Δ H 0 − T Δ S 0 Hence, a Van’t Hoff plot of the natural logarithm of K ex (T) versus the inverse temperature will yield a slope proportional to the enthalpy and an intercept proportional to the entropy.: (10) ln K e x ( T ) = − Δ H 0 R T + Δ S 0 R Plotting the natural logarithm of K ex (T) versus inverse temperature, a line (R 2 =0.99) with a slope and intercept of 4.421 and −10.208 was revealed, as shown in Fig. 3 . These parameters yield ΔH =−36.76kJmol−1 and ΔS =−84.87Jmol−1 K−1, which indicate an exothermic reaction that should be, according to Eq. (9), less spontaneous with increasing temperature. This trend is in agreement with the decreasing distribution values at higher temperatures. The values calculated for ΔG(T) are listed in Table 1."
8,Effect of hydrogen ion and chloride anion concentration,"3.4 Effect of hydrogen ion and chloride anion concentration According the results shown in Section 3.2, the extraction of gold chloro complexes by CTAB/n-heptane/iso-amyl alcohol/Na2SO3 microemulsion is inferred to occur in terms of the anion-exchange reactions expressed by Eqs. (1) and (2). However, the coexistence of hydrogen, hydroxide, chloride, and hydroxide–chloride complexes makes gold speciation very complex. Hence, the hydrogen ion and chloride anion concentration could affect the speciation of gold and the anion-exchange reaction. Fig. 4 compares the natural logarithm of Au(III) distribution ratio (D) for different concentrations of hydrogen ion (chloride anion concentration was 5M) and different concentrations chloride anion (in 0.5M HCl). The chloride anion concentrations were adjusted by NaCl. The study of gold extraction using Winsor II microemulsion both showed negative effect of hydrogen ion and chloride anion concentration. The extraction of gold both tends to decrease as the hydrogen ion or chloride anion concentration is increased. When the hydrogen ion concentration is high, the ion pair (R–N) +AuCl4 − is less associated because Au(III) is most likely exists as chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) species, which is less dissociated at lower hydrogen ion concentration as Eq. (1). With increasing the hydrogen ion concentration, the equilibrium (Eq. (1)) moves to the left and the quantity of AuCl4 − ions extracted to form complex ion associate with CTAB+ decreased. On the other hand, the distribution ratio of Au(III) decreases first with increasing the chloride anion concentration and then little changes happened after the chloride anion concentration reaches 2M. Some of the published information that is relevant to this research has showed different results. Shen et al. found the increasing HCl concentration results in a increasing Au extraction when 2-hydroxy-4-sec-octanoyl diphenyl-ketoxime was used as extractant [23]. Martinez et al. observed the percentage of gold extracted achieves an optimum at HCl concentrations as high as 5–7M in the case of using phosphine oxide (Cyanex 921) as extractant and the concentration of chloride anions did not affect Au(III) extraction [24]. This can be explained by the complex of gold chloride anions were extracted in the organic phase under the forms of HAuCl4L and HAuCl4L2, where L represents the extractant."
9,Selective extraction of gold from other base metal ions,"3.5 Selective extraction of gold from other base metal ions From the point of material composition, electronic waste can be defined as a mixture of various metals, particularly copper, aluminum, nickel, iron and steel [4]. The high concentration of these metal ions might interfere with the selective recovery of gold. Fig. 5 shows the extraction behavior of some base metal ions (Fe3+, Al3+, Cu2+, Ni2+) at varying hydrochloric acid concentrations. It is clear that the CTAB/n-heptane/iso-amyl alcohol/Na2SO3 microemulsion was found to be highly selectivity for Au(III) and the extraction percentage of Au(III) is almost 100% for the whole range of HCl concentrations. In the higher HCl range, Fe3+ is significantly extracted and the extraction percentage reaches 73.2% at 5M HCl."
10,Gold recovery from electronic waste,"3.6 Gold recovery from electronic waste The weight composition of metals for this electronic waste was: 0.12% Au, 19.74% Cu, 7.98% Ni, 2.38% Sn, 1.61% Zn, 1.59% Fe, 0.51% Cr and 0.35% Pb. As stated above, the optimized parameters for the extraction of gold with the CTAB/n-heptane/iso-amyl alcohol/Na2SO3 microemulsion were: R =8, time of extraction about 8min, room temperature and the concentration of CTAB in the microemulsion 0.05M. The concentrations of gold in the aqueous solution before and after the extraction were 48 and 1.64μgmL−1, which means more than 96% was extracted into the organic phase. Hence, this study could be a promising method to recover gold from electronic waste."
11,Treatment of CTAB wastewater by Fenton oxidation combined with chemical coagulation,"3.7 Treatment of CTAB wastewater by Fenton oxidation combined with chemical coagulation A large number of surfactants, including CTAB employed in the present study, can result in serious environmental problems when they release to the environment. When used the microemulsion contained 0.05M CTAB, the wastewater after the extraction was detected with 14.67mgL−1 CTAB. Fenton oxidation process using a mixture of Fe2+ salts and hydrogen peroxide H2O2, has been found effective and less expensive to implement in dealing with various types of industrial wastewaters [25–27]. In this paper, Fenton oxidation and chemical coagulation was combined in order to remove CTAB from water after the extraction of Au(III). The influence of initial pH, time of mixing, the concentration of Fe2+ and H2O2 was studied. Under the optimum operating conditions (50mgL−1 [Fe2+]0 plus 120mgL−1 [H2O2]0 at initial pH 3 and treatment time is 40min), the CTAB surfactant removal was found to be over 97%. Combined with chemical coagulation, the Fe2+ and COD dissolved in the wastewater and the suspended colloid generated by the oxidation process could be removed and the water quality reached the requirement of the standards for wastewater discharge in China."
12,Process of gold recovery from electrical waste for production,"3.8 Process of gold recovery from electrical waste for production On the basis of laboratory studies, a production line for gold recovery from electrical waste has been designed. The process consists of the following steps: (1) The electronic waste was mechanically crushed for size reduction and then leaching with nitric acid solution ( V HNO 3 : V H 2 O = 1 : 3 ) in order to remove silver and base metals. (2) Filtration of the suspension and the solid was leaching with aqua regia for dissolving metallic gold. (3) Selective extraction of gold with the microemulsion. (4) Treatment of the CTAB wastewater generated the extraction by Fenton oxidation combined with chemical coagulation."
13,Conclusions,"CTAB/n-heptane/iso-amyl alcohol/Na2SO3 was chosen for the formation of the microemulsion. The results obtained in the present study show that the extraction equilibrium is immediately achieved and the extracted compound is likely to be AuCl4 −CTAB+. The enthalpy and entropy of Au(III) extraction into the microemulsion were calculated to be −36.76kJmol−1 and −84.87Jmol−1 K−1. The influence of temperature on the extraction has been investigated at temperatures ranging from 288 to 313K. The decrease in the distribution of Au(III) with temperature can be explained by the increase of ΔG. When evaluating the extraction behavior of Au(III) in hydrochloric acid solutions, the results shown that the concentrations of hydrogen ion and chloride anion both have a negative effect for the extraction of Au(III). The CTAB/n-heptane/iso-amyl alcohol/Na2SO3 microemulsion was also found to be highly selectivity for Au(III) over base metal ions (Fe3+, Al3+, Cu2+, Ni2+). The results presented in the paper shown a hydrometallurgical method for the efficient and economical recovery of gold from electrical waste was developed."
