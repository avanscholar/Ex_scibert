0,Introduction,"The research of solutions to incorporate renewable fuels in the transport sector has become urgent in recent years due to the need to limit the environmental impacts of passengers and freight transfer [1]. Also, in the last decades the consumption of diesel has risen significantly – due to the increase in sales of passenger vehicles using this fuel – reaching 44% of sales share in the European market in 2017 [2]. Combining this contribution with heavy-duty vehicles and buses, diesel occupies a large share (71% in 2016 [3]) of the road transport final energy consumption in the European Union. Crude oil is by far the main feedstock for diesel production worldwide, and this contributes significantly to the emissions of the transport sector. In 2016 the global share of greenhouse gas emissions attributable to the transport sector was 24% [4]. Biofuels represent a valuable option for the decarbonization of the transport sector and they offer important advantages compared to other alternatives. In particular, they can be mixed with fossil fuels without major modifications of the engine design and they do not require a radical change in the infrastructure for fuel distribution. This aspect makes them the most viable short-term option to introduce a renewable energy source in vehicles. In terms of chemical composition, biofuels do not contain aromatics and their sulfur content is usually low (below 10 mg/kg) [5,6]. Moreover, these options may be a way of improving security of supply by promoting the use of local resources [7], and of contributing to the recycling of the carbon present in waste substances [8]. The most relevant biofuels in the European context are mainly: FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Esters), obtained from the reaction of vegetable oils or animal fats with alcohols (i.e. a transesterification reaction); and HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) resulting from the reaction of virgin or waste oils with hydrogen in a process commonly called hydrotreatment. Regarding the compatibility with fossil diesel, FAME fuels require engine modification for high blends [9], while HVO can be used with no blend level restriction [10]. On the other hand, the chemical properties of HVO (also called “green-diesel”) are more similar to those of fossil diesel, especially for the absence of double bonds in the carbon chains, and this allows such fuel to reach higher blends in fossil fuels. Furthermore, several sources confirm that HVO and paraffinic synthetic fuels typically result in lower exhaust emission levels (NOx, PM, CO, and HC) and good engine performance [11]. One of the feedstock for HVO is waste vegetable oil (WVO) – the current production of which was estimated between 700 and 1,000 kt per year in Europe [12]. The main challenges for the use of these resources are associated to their collection and treatment. Producing biofuels, and particularly biodiesel, from WVO enables the implementation of the circular economy concept and avoids the use of virgin oils. Then, since WVO is considered a residue, its adoption for the production of biodiesel can give a substantial contribution in the fulfillment of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) target for incorporating renewable sources in the transport sector. In fact, the energy content of biofuels derived from residues is double counted [13], as such biofuels are considered neutral in terms of greenhouse gas emissions [14]. The production of HVO via hydrotreatment requires large amount of hydrogen and, so far, the main source of hydrogen has been the steam reforming of hydrocarbons 1 1 Hydrogen obtained from steam reforming of natural gas is also called grey hydrogen and it is opposed to green hydrogen, which is generated by renewable energy sources and avoids the production of carbon emissions in the first place [89]. . This fact justifies the study of alternative solutions that achieve satisfactory hydrogen production performance, making use of renewable energy sources. Among them, the use of low-carbon electricity to enable the production of synthetic hydrocarbons has been extensively studied in conjunction with both gaseous and liquid fuels [15–18]. The pathways integrating electrolysis with fuel production that are currently available in literature are mainly focused on hydrocarbon synthesis through methanation [19], Fischer-Tropsch processes [20], and on methanol/dimethyl ether (DME) synthesis [21,22]. However, the integration of electrolysis with hydrotreatment has been investigated only in a preliminary study developed by the authors of this paper [23]. Since many studies suggest that the production of HVO will substantially contribute to the decarbonization of the transport sector [24,25], with future scenarios projecting the phase-out of conventional biodiesel replaced with HVO [26], a deeper analysis of the techno-economic and environmental performance of this process should be carried out. In recent years a few studies have scrutinized the performance and the profitability of different options for HVO production. Sonthalia et al. [27] and No et al. [28] present a review of hydrotreatment processes involving various types of feedstock, both virgin and waste oils, and describe the main effects of HVO use in diesel engines. Glisic et al. [29] and Pinto et al. [30] investigate the operation of different plant configurations for HVO production using either waste oils or rapeseed virgin oil. The previous studies were mostly focused on demonstrating the technical and economic viability of HVO production, proving it to be a competitive alternative to FAME [31]. However, none of these studies considered hydrogen coming from electrolysis processes, that could potentially make use of low-carbon electricity coming from renewable sources. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap through the integration of a high-temperature electrolysis unit, i.e. composed of Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (SOECs), with the hydrotreatment process of WVO. The assessment of the energy efficiency and economic viability of the integration of these two processes constitutes the main original contribution of this research. The structure of the paper is the following: Section 2 describes the process for HVO production. Section 3 illustrates the plant layout. Section 4 outlines the methodology and includes the cost assumptions. Section 5 presents the energy and economic results of the plant. Section 6 discusses the baseline assumptions through a Monte Carlo and sensitivity analyses. Section 7 reports the conclusions of the paper."
1,Process design,"This section illustrates the three main parts of the HVO production process, namely: feedstock pre-treatment, water electrolysis for hydrogen production and hydrotreatment."
2,Feedstock origin and pre-treatment,"2.1 Feedstock origin and pre-treatment The synthesis of HVO can be performed using virgin vegetable oils, waste oils (WVO) or animal fats as feedstock. The conversion of waste materials, in particular WVO, has been preferred because it is a feedstock that does not entail any competition with food crops. Moreover, recycling waste oils and animal fats reduces the quantity of residues that are landfilled and that can create problems to the wastewater collection system [32]. The main sources of WVO are food processing industry, restaurants and households [33]. The adoption of feedstocks with different quality levels requires a pre-treatment process – that the raw materials usually undergo before hydrogenation – in order to remove phosphorous and sulfur compounds, traces of metals and soaps that negatively affect the quality of the final product and the life of the hydrogenation catalyst [34]. This is an essential step to guarantee higher yields in conversion, since catalyst deactivation can occur when phosphor- and sulfur-containing compounds reach the active sites and irreversibly adsorb onto them [35]. For the same reason, hydrogen sulfide and carbon monoxide should not be present in the hydrogen stream [35]. The feedstock pre-treatment usually consists of three processes: neutralization, degumming and bleaching [31,36]. The presence and the amount of impurities in the waste oil influence the pre-treatment process [37]. Free fatty acids are possible contaminants which can be removed by means of a neutralization step involving the use of alkaline solutions [37]. Other impurities, e.g. the calcium and magnesium salts of the phosphatidic acid, are usually nonhydratable and, therefore, difficult to remove. Degumming is the process that eliminates all types of phosphatides, including the nonhydratable ones. If the phosphatide content is small (<20 ppm), as in palm oils, these impurities can be treated via a dry degumming process, with concentrated phosphoric acid [31]. Otherwise, different processes (e.g. acid or EDTA degumming) can be applied [31,36]. Bleaching is the final step and it aims at diminishing the amount of non-converted phosphatides, trace metals and other contaminants present in the oil [35,37]."
3,Water electrolysis,"2.2 Water electrolysis The production of hydrogen for hydrotreatment has been considered to occur in solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs), having an operating temperature in the range of 600–1000 °C and, hence, are considered a high temperature electrolysis technology. There are other technological options for water electrolysis, mainly alkaline cells and proton exchange membrane (PEM) cells, which are characterized by lower temperature intervals (ca 60–100 °C). However, SOECs have been chosen because of their higher efficiency, which can reach 100% in thermo-neutral conditions [38]. The thermo-neutral operation occurs when the heat produced by the Joule effect of the flowing current is equal to the heat demand necessary for the water splitting. The higher efficiency is due to the fact that part of the energy can be provided in form of heat, and not necessarily as electricity. In addition, SOECs have a lower internal resistance compared to other cell technologies and this reduces energy losses [39]. The high operating temperature favors the integration of this technology with other processes, that can benefit from high quality heat and, in turn, reduce the recourse to external sources of thermal energy. A more extensive description of the working principle, the materials and the advantages of SOECs can be found in Laguna-Bercero [40]."
4,Hydrotreatment process,"2.3 Hydrotreatment process The catalytic hydrotreatment of vegetable oils is performed under a temperature which ranges between 300 °C and 450 °C, while the hydrogen pressure applied is generally between 3 MPa and 20 MPa [27,41]. Several noble or transition metal catalysts can be used for this reaction (Pd, Pt, Co-Mo, Ni-Mo) and these, along with the temperature and pressure values, have an important effect in controlling the product distribution [42]. In a continuous hydrotreatment process, the waste vegetable oils undergo three steps. First, the substrate is mixed and pre-saturated with hydrogen under high temperature [43]. Then, the gas–liquid mixture is fed to the reactor where it reacts over a fixed-bed of catalyst in a trickle-bed configuration. The products are finally directed to a separator after being cooled down, in order to degas the light by-products and the unreacted hydrogen dissolved in the liquid [27]. The first reaction occurring inside the hydrotreatment reactor is the hydrogenation of the double bonds present in the fatty esters and the cracking of the molecules, to produce intermediate free fatty acids and propane [44]. The oxygen is then removed via three routes. These include the hydro-deoxygenation, hydro-decarboxylation and hydro-decarbonylation [45]. The former is responsible for the formation of water and alkanes with an even number of carbon atoms, while the other two produce alkanes with an odd number of carbon atoms, along with CO2 and CO respectively [45]. Fig. 1 shows these reaction pathways for the hydrotreatment of triolein. Sulphided Co-Mo, Ni-Mo and Ni-W supported on γ-Al2O3 are generally more active than monometallic catalysts [42]. The Co-Mo and Ni-Mo catalysts normally favor the hydro-deoxygenation reaction pathway. In particular, in a hydrotreating reaction conducted on soybean oil, it was found that using Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 the C17-to-C18 product ratio was one of the lowest (i.e. 2.16) among the results from other mono- and bi-metallic catalysts [44]. In our work, the conversion of vegetable oils into green diesel occurs in a fixed bed reactor at 300 °C, using a commercial Co-Mo catalyst dispersed on an alumina support [29]. The waste oil conversion process is modeled similarly to [46], while the inlet waste vegetable oil is assumed to be completely composed of triolein [29]. The stoichiometry of the hydrotreatment reactions represented in Fig. 1 are summarized in Eq. (1). Only heptadecane and octadecane are considered as products, which is in agreement with previous studies [41]. The flow of hydrogen directed to the hydrotreatment reactor is in large excess 2 2 The molar ratio H2: WVO is higher than 60:1. compared to the stoichiometry of the reaction. (1) C 57 H 104 O 6 + 10 H 2 → C O 2 + 3 H 2 O + C O + C 3 H 8 + 2 C 17 H 36 + C 18 H 38 The chemical behavior of HVO is more similar to the one of the fossil diesel also in terms of water solubility and oxidative stability [47]. Therefore, no extra precautions are needed regarding pipelines, tanks or service stations and the fuel does not experience any major degradation if properly stored [48]."
5,Process layout,
6,Plant layout,"3.1 Plant layout The scheme of the plant for HVO production is presented in Fig. 2 . It is designed for an annual production of 100,000 tonnes, working for 8000 h per year that correspond to a capacity factor >90% [29]. The engineering plant simulations were performed in the process engineering software Aspen Plus using the RK-ASPEN thermodynamic model. The two main inflows to the process are demineralized water for hydrogen production and WVO. The hydrogen production step is described in Section 3.2, then the gas is fed directly to the hydrotreatment reactor (R1). The other input of the process is a flow of raw WVO. The first stage of the process consists in a pre-treatment (see Section 2.1), that yields a proper feedstock for the conversion into hydrocarbons. Then, the treated oil is pressurized to 70 bar and heated to 290 °C and fed, together with the hydrogen coming from the electrolyzer, to the hydrotreatment reactor. The outlet stream of the reactor firstly goes through a flash tank, operating at 70 °C, which is used to separate liquid hydrocarbons from water and syngas. The vapor stream from the first flash tank (F1) flows through a membrane (M) with a hydrogen selectivity of roughly 100% 3 3 In the simulation the selectivity is assumed equal to 99.5%. The second stream exiting the membrane is a mixture of water, CO2, CO, propane and hydrogen that is not furtherly utilized. [49] and the resulting stream is split: a part is recirculated to R1, while the remaining part is sent to the isomerization reactor (R2). The liquid stream reaches 355 °C and 50 bar and it is directed towards R2 with the function of partially isomerizing the n-alkanes to improve the cold properties of the final fuel [27]. In the simulation 10% of both C17H36 and C18H38 was assumed to be isomerized into 6-pentyldodecane and 8-propylpentadecane respectively. At the same time a small fraction of heptadecane (4.7% wt) is cracked into gaseous compounds that have been modeled uniquely as propane (Eq. (2)) [46,50]. (2) 3 C 17 H 36 + 14 H 2 → 17 C 3 H 8 The products of the isomerization are cooled down to 50 °C and a flash tank (F2) separates the liquid hydrocarbons, constituting the HVO, from the gaseous components that are recirculated. Hydrogen-rich streams are recirculated due to high H2 flows required by both reactors. In order to estimate the volume of the reactors the Liquid Hour Space Velocity (LHSV) was established. In R1 the LHSV is 1.0 h−1 [29], therefore, the hourly volume flow rate entering the reactor is equivalent to the volume of the reactor itself and the vessel is considered to be vertical. The isomerization reactor has a LHSV of 2.1 h−1 [51]. The sizing of the flash tanks was done according to the methods described in [52]. The efficiency of the plant is quantified through Eq. (3). The power inputs are represented by the electric power ( Wel ) required by pumps, compressors and by the electrolyzer, as well as the energy content of the feedstock expressed as lower heating value multiplied by the mass flow rate ( LH V WVO ∙ m ̇ WVO ). The power output is represented by the flow of HVO multiplied by its mass flow rate ( LH V HVO ∙ m ̇ HVO ). (3) η = L H V H V O ∙ m ̇ H V O W e l + L H V W V O ∙ m ̇ W V O The results of the simulations, obtained with the software Aspen Plus, are summarized in Section 5."
7,SOEC model,"3.2 SOEC model Hydrogen is typically produced through steam-reforming of natural gas in oil refineries, which does not promote a reduction of fossil-fuel dependency associated to the transport sector. Alternatively, hydrogen could be produced through electrolysis in case there was a large availability of cheap and low-carbon electricity. In this study, high-temperature Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (SOECs) are used because of their high operating temperature and conversion efficiency [40,53]. Part of the cathodic flow exiting the electrolyzer (Fig. 2) is recirculated to increase the hydrogen content at the inlet of the cathode (set to 10% in volume), to avoid an excessively oxidizing environment, thus, limiting the risk of oxidation of the nickel catalyst of the cells. The electrolyser is operated at thermo-neutral conditions and it is fed with demineralized water available at 20 °C and 1 atm, which must be pre-heated to reach the conditions suitable for the electrolysis. The water electrolysis reaction is considered to take place at 850 °C. Part of the oxygen produced at the anode is recirculated and it acts as sweep gas 4 4 The oxygen recirculation is not present in Fig. 22, where only the outlet oxygen stream is represented. , avoiding the use of air that could compromise the quality of the outlet oxygen, which in this case could be collected and used for other applications because of its very high purity. After the electrolyzer, the cathodic flow is cooled down to 80 °C and it enters a flash separator in order to obtain a hydrogen stream at 99% purity, that constitutes one of the reactants for the hydrotreatment process. The model of the SOEC was adapted from [54] and the water conversion has been set to 70% to avoid losses due to diffusion limitation [55]. The active area of the SOEC is calculated considering that the operation occurs in thermo-neutral conditions and that the Area Specific Resistance (ASR) is equal to 0.5 Ω cm2. The flow of hydrogen goes through an intercooled compression in two stages reaching 70 bar, which is the pressure at which the catalytic hydrotreatment takes place."
8,Heat exchangers network,"3.3 Heat exchangers network The plant is able to supply all the thermal energy that is needed for the chemical processes without using external sources of heat. As a result, the Pinch Analysis methodology [56] has been applied in order to calculate the minimum number of heat exchangers and the corresponding heat exchange area that enables a complete thermal integration. The considered heat-exchange coefficients are 200 W/(m2K) for liquid–liquid heat exchange and 100 W/(m2K) for gas–gas [57], while the minimum temperature difference between cold and hot flows is imposed at 10 °C. The composite curves for the hot and cold streams are shown in Fig. 3 , where the heat excess is highlighted. The layout of the plant with the indication of the heat exchangers is reported in Fig. 4 ."
9,Economic considerations,
10,Economic assessment methods,"4.1 Economic assessment methods The approaches adopted to evaluate the economic performance of the plant are the levelized cost of fuel (LCOF) and the net present value (NPV) analysis. The first method gives an estimation of the unit production cost of HVO, while the second method allows the balance between future positive and negative cash flows to be estimated over the lifetime of the HVO plant. For both the approaches the costs of the equipment, of the feedstock, and of the disposable materials, as well as all the other fixed costs required for the HVO plant operation, need to be calculated. A plant lifetime of 20 years was considered for all the components of the plant, except for the SOEC which was considered to have a lifetime ( l t ) of 10 years [57]. A discount rate ( d ) of 5% was assumed. The levelized cost of fuel (LCOF) is computed as in Eq. (4). (4) LCOF = CRF ∙ I N V ∗ + O & M + I N P U T Pro d y Where CRF is the capital recovery factor, IN V ∗ is the initial investment that accounts for the replacement of the SOEC after 10 years 5 5 IN V ∗ = ∑ y = 0 N = l i f e t i m e IN V y 1 + d y , O & M is the annual operation and maintenance cost, INPUT is the sum of all the costs related to the input mass and energy streams and Pro d y is the annual production of HVO. The numerator is expressed in €/year, while the denominator in tHVO/year. The NPV is instead calculated according to Eq. (5). (5) NPV = ∑ y = 1 l t Pro d y ∙ P HVO - O & M - I N P U T - I T 1 + d y - ∑ y = 1 l t I N V y Where P HVO is the price of HVO in €/t, IT stands for income tax and IN V y is the investment in the yth year. The tax component is excluded from the calculation of the LCOF because this metric aims at quantifying the cost related to the resources needed to produce the HVO. Income taxes should be excluded when evaluating the pure production cost of the fuel since they are based on the annual profit. On the other hand, they should be included in the calculation of the NPV since they influence the profitability of the investment. Income taxes are charged on the taxable income of a company that is the gross profit, defined as revenues minus operating costs (variable O&M costs and utilities), minus the assets' depreciation [58]. The considered tax rate is 22.5%, which is the average European Union statutory income tax according to the OECD statistics [59]."
11,Component cost and material cost estimation,"4.2 Component cost and material cost estimation The costs associated to the presented design are based on an estimation of each of the plant’s component. For all the pieces of equipment, with the exclusion of the electrolyser, the bare erected costs were determined according to the formulations in [60] and expressed in $2001. Conversely, the SOEC cost for unit of active area is 550 $2007/kW which is accordance with the estimation in [57]. All the costs have been harmonized in $2017 using the CEPCI index (CI,2017 = 567.5, CI,2007 = 525.4, CI,2001 = 397) 6 6 The CEPCI index is applied as follows: $ year , 1 $ year , 0 = CEPCI year , 1 CEPCI year , 0 . [61], and, then, converted into Euros with the application of an exchange rate of 1.1 €/$. The cost for the hydrogen separation membrane has been set equal to 1500 $/ft2 which is equivalent to 16,150 $/m2. This value has been derived from a technical report that conducts a feasibility analysis on separation membranes to obtain >99% pure hydrogen streams [62]. It is assumed that the membrane is replaced every 5 years. The cost of waste vegetable oil and the price for HVO have been based on the data provided by the biodiesel broker Greenea [63]. The margin between the price of the final product and the cost of the raw material has been reported to be the interval 150–400 €/t, in the period between January 2017 and January 2020. Considering that the price of WVO has ranged between 800 and 600 €/t, it is evident that the margin of the biodiesel producers is not very high, with clear implications on the viability of such business. The price of WVO is similar to that of virgin oil 7 7 As an example, the price of the Malaysian palm oil ranged between 480 and 780 €/t in the period (2015–2019) [90]. and this is mainly due to the double-counting of the biodiesel produced from waste material as part of the renewable energy directive [13]. A good example of the consequences of the RED is the Portuguese case, which shows that in recent years the country has radically changed its raw material import mix for biodiesel production, switching to massive importation and use of WVO [64]. In this study the baseline value for WVO cost has been assumed to be 400 €/t, which belongs to the upper part of the price range available in similar studies. Glisic et al. [29] assumes a price of 260 $/t 8 8 A WVO price of 260 $/t is equivalent to 235 €/t with the exchange rate considered in this study. , Farid et al. [65] uses a price of 200 $/t 9 9 A WVO price of 200 $/t is equivalent to 182 €/t with the exchange rate considered in this study. and Mandolesi de Araújo et al. [66] reports a price ranging between 224 and 415 $/t. Other researches [67,68] consider WVO to be available at no or very low cost. An estimate of WVO pre-treatment costs can be derived from the work of Zhang et al. [69], where an economic feasibility study is made on alternative processes that produce biodiesel via transesterification. The pre-treatment cost is considered to be 0.76 M$, referred to a biodiesel production of 8000 t/year and assuming a product yield equal to 0.9 tbiodiesel/tfeedstock. This results in a cost of 85.5 $/(tin,WVO/year). This unit capacity cost has been employed to scale up the total capacity cost, using an exponent equal to 0.6 [60]. Therefore, the pre-treatment cost for a HVO plant is assumed to be comparable with that of a biodiesel production plant adopting a transesterification process. The HVO price has been assumed in line with the average price of FAME registered in the period January 2017–January 2020, namely 1000 €/t [70]. This assumption is conservative because, as described in the introduction, HVO quality is superior to FAME. The electricity cost has been fixed at 40 €/MWh. This value represents a target value for electricity cost when electrolysis for hydrogen and fuel synthesis is considered [71]. In Europe, similar prices are charged to large energy consumers (>150 GWh/year) in Sweden and Norway 10 10 The price excludes VAT and other recoverable taxes and levies. . These are the European countries where these types of consumers have access to the lowest tariff [72]. These two countries have also a very high renewable content of the electricity (65% in Sweden and over 100% in Norway [73]) and, therefore, represent an ideal setting for the integration of high-temperature electrolysis and hydrotreatment. In this study the produced oxygen is assumed to positively contribute to the profitability of the plant. Its large production rate (3 t/y) and its high purity (>99% [74]) are two factors that contribute to its economic exploitation. The oxygen price for industrial customers is considered equal to 50 $/t [75]. The operation and maintenance (O&M) cost has a fixed and a variable component. The fixed component includes labor, maintenance and insurance costs. Labor is accounted with 21 workers (7 workers per shift / 3 shifts per day) with an income of 40,000 $/year [29], while insurance and ordinary maintenance costs correspond to 1% and 2% of the total plant cost, respectively [76]. The variable component includes the cost for the replacement of the catalysts in the hydrotreatment and isomerization processes. The cost for the hydrotreatment catalyst is assumed equal to 56.96 $/tHVO [29]; while the isomerization catalyst is considered equal to 258 $/tHVO, which is an average of the values reported in Ngo et al. [77]. All the parameters and assumptions concerning the economic analysis are summarized in Table 1 ."
12,Results,The next section reports the energy and economic performance of the plant.
13,Energy efficiency,"5.1 Energy efficiency Following the assumptions presented in Section 3, the input and output energy and mass flows obtained for the considered plant are summarized in Table 2 . The energy efficiency of the plant 11 11 The lower heating value for vegetable oil is 39.5 MJ/kg [91] while for HVO is 44 MJ/kg [81]. (see Eq. (3)) is equal to 80%, which is in accordance with similar studies [27]. This value is influenced by the thermal integration of the plant, which eliminates the needs of external heat, with savings equivalent to 98 MW. Furthermore, 18 MW of extra heat are available above 100 °C, meaning that there is additional room for heat integration, especially with the buildings connected to the plant."
14,Economic assessment,"5.2 Economic assessment The economic performance of the plant was estimated through the calculation of the net present value and of the levelized cost of fuel (see Section 4), including fixed and variable costs associated to the construction of the HVO plant. The capital cost has been obtained by applying the methodology defined by the National Energy Technology Laboratory [78] for energy conversion facilities. Table 3 reports the total plant cost (TPC), indicating the share for each category of components, the variable costs associated to the replacement of the disposables, mainly catalysts, and the fixed operation and maintenance costs (e.g. insurance and labor). Following the procedure in [76], the TPC is increased by 20% to obtain the Total Overnight Cost (TOC) which includes the purchase of land, legal fees and permission costs, preliminary feasibility analyses, capital inventory and cost of securing financing. Finally, in order to obtain the Total as Spent Cost (TASC) 12 12 Total as-spent cost (TASC) accounts for capital cost escalation during capital expenditure period and interest on debt during construction (assumed equal to 3 years in this case). , the TOC is multiplied by a 1.075 as suggested in [78]. The levelized cost of fuel is 901 €/t, which corresponds to 0.73 €/l (density 0.8 kg/l). This value is aligned with the results obtained by [29] for a WVO hydrogenation unit which is not incorporated in a refinery 13 13 Glisic et al. [29] calculated that the cost of HVO is 1 $/kg (ca 0.91 €/kg with the considered exchange rate), considering a WVO price of 260 $/t, which is lower than the price considered in the current analysis (i.e. 400 €/t). . The NPV analysis shows that the baseline case produces positive results with a discounted value of 44 M€ after 10 years and 98 M€ after 20 years, corresponding to 119% and 265% of the initial investment, respectively (Fig. 5 ). The flat behavior of the NPV around the 10th year is due to the replacement of the SOEC stack, that has a shorter life compared to the rest of the components. The comparison of the LCOF with the price of HVO, assumed equal to 1000 €/t, reveals that the margin is around 10%. This implies that substantial fluctuations of the HVO price could compromise the financial viability of the investment (see Section 6.1). However, the NPV results suggest that the investment has the potential to be profitable, with a final value of the investment that is more than double the capital initially invested."
15,Discussion,
16,Monte Carlo analysis,"6.1 Monte Carlo analysis The results highlighted the strong dependence of the economic performance on the assumptions for some of the parameters reported in Table 1. In order to assess the variables that have higher impact the profitability of the plant, a Monte Carlo analysis has been conducted on the value of the NPV at the end of the project considered lifetime (i.e. 20 years). Several parameters were varied separately as shown in Table 4 , assuming a uniform random distribution between the considered lower and upper boundaries. For each of the parameters, 10,000 simulations were run to guarantee the convergence of the model. The outcomes of the assessment, consisting in the average values and the confidence intervals, are illustrated in Fig. 6 . A variable that has a large impact on the economic viability of the project is the price of WVO. Considering a price interval that spans between 235 €/t (which is aligned with the assumption made by Glisic et al. [29]) and 700 €/t (which is representative of the price of virgin oils [66]) implies that in more than half of the scenarios, the NPV at the end of the project is negative. The threshold price to obtain a positive NPV is equal to 480 €/t, which is higher than what the WVO price that is usually considered in these sorts of analysis (see Section 4.2). Imposing such a high upper boundary has been done to investigate profitability of the process with virgin oils, in case WVO was difficult to retrieve. However, this option turns out not to be viable. The cost for the plant equipment (SOEC and others), and the maintenance costs are not so influential in the final NPV outcome of the project, compared to the price of external variables. Extending the sensitivity interval for WVO up to a price that is characteristic of virgin oil appears excessively penalizing for the profitability of the plant. Instead, imposing the upper boundary so that it is symmetrical with respect to the base case (565 €/t) is more representative of the fluctuations that the price can experience. In addition, considering a possible subsidy in terms of lower fiscal load (by varying the income tax level from 22.5% to 15% and 10%), the profitability of the plant improves further, as shown in Fig. 7 . Income tax reduction to 10% improves the average NPV results by 37%, portraying that this could be a useful policy instrument to promote the production of more sustainable hydrotreated vegetable oil. On the other hand, lowering the discount rate to 3%, hence, simulating a situation with lower financial risk, increases the NPV by 33%. The solid oxide electrolyzer is the most expensive component of the whole plant and also the one with the shortest lifetime. In spite of this, a three-fold increase in the price does not seem to cause the NPV20 to be negative. This means that the main focus of the plant operator should be to secure long-term contracts for raw material and electricity with commodity prices that are compatible with the profitability of the investment. On the other hand, a strategy to protect the revenue stream from excessive HVO price fluctuations should be implemented. A possible way of mitigating this issue is to sell large part of the HVO on the future market with a secured price."
17,Sensitivity analysis,"6.2 Sensitivity analysis The Monte Carlo analysis has highlighted that WVO, electricity and HVO market price are the most relevant variables that determine the profitability of the investment. According to Fig. 6, in most than 50% of the cases the project has a positive NPV after 20 years. However, NPV is not the only variable that should be used to evaluate the investment, but the payback time is also important to determine when the project has recovered all the initial costs. This aspect is analyzed by assessing the behavior of the NPV along the project lifetime, varying one variable at a time. Evaluating the WVO price (see Fig. 8 ), The 400 €/t scenario for WVO price is characterized by a payback period of less than 4 years, meaning that the project has positive returns for>75% of its lifetime. A price reduction of 38% to 235 €/t would lead to lower payback period, between 1 and 2 years. Since WVO is a residue and its use in this context is aligned both with the circular economy concept and with the decarbonization goals, this low-price scenario could be favored by specific policies aiming at a complete reutilization of the waste oils. A scenario of increasing WVO price, or of partial feed of virgin oil, represented by a price equal to 565 €/t, would not encourage the investment, since the NPV would be largely negative at the end of the project lifetime. Regarding the price of electricity, a 50% reduction of the baseline price (20 €/MWh) would mean that the payback is reached before the third year (Fig. 9 ). On the other hand, higher electricity prices (60 and 80 €/MWh) delay the payback time of the investment. A price higher than 80 €/MWh would compromise the profitability of the investment since the NPV after 20 years would likely be negative. The range of electricity prices reflects the different production costs for different countries and power generation mixes. High shares of hydro and nuclear energy in the generation mix push the cost down, while gas and fuel oil plants entail higher costs. Generation costs for variable renewables, such as solar and wind, are experiencing a sharp decrease [79], which, coupled with increasing market penetrations, are likely to push the wholesale electricity price down. Finally, the HVO market price variations have been taken into account to model the fluctuations of the quotations on global markets (Fig. 10 ). An increase from 1000 to 1200 €/t would result in a decrease of the payback period from 3.5 to less than 2 years. The variability on the selling price is the variable that has the highest influence on the profitability, since a 20% variation in the unit price entails a percentage variation on the NPV20 around 200%."
18,Environmental benefits and comparison with other studies,"6.3 Environmental benefits and comparison with other studies The large benefits deriving from the decarbonization of the transport sector justify the efforts to explore synergies between complementary processes to increase the conversion efficiency. The promotion of liquid biofuels is considered one of the main pathways to pursue in the short-medium term [80]. These energy carriers can contribute to a rapid decrease in greenhouse gas emissions since they can be adopted with conventional diesel vehicles and distributed using existing infrastructures. HVO produced from WVO is one of these options, since it enables higher incorporation ratios in fossil diesel than FAME. It also allows large quantities of waste oils to be recycled, without being landfilled or, inputted in the sewage system. The lifecycle emissions for the production of biodiesel that can be found in Arvidsson et al. [81] are estimated around 375 gCO2/kWh of HVO, which are two thirds of those for diesel (i.e. 563 gCO2/kWh). This means that the annual production of HVO from a plant like the one described in this study would save 230 kt of CO2 for replacing fossil diesel. Moreover, the use of electricity with a low or zero carbon content bears a considerable environmental benefit. The production of hydrogen through steam reforming entails a CO2 emission of 0.45 molCO2/molH2 [82,83], while the emission factor for electricity production can be very close to zero. For instance, 1 MWh of electricity generated in Sweden and Norway produces respectively 0.023 and 0 tCO2 [84]. Considering that the plant is located in one of these two countries, the emissions deriving from electricity would be 2.8 kt for the Swedish case and zero for the Norwegian one. On the other hand, the annual CO2 emitted by the steam reforming would amount to 33.8 kt (ca 0.34 tCO2/tHVO). This entails that the environmental performance of the SOEC-hydrotreatment integrated process can add a further environmental benefit to the production of HVO, which is already less polluting than fossil diesel. The total avoided emissions, deriving from fossil diesel substitution and from the use of low carbon electricity, represent a reduction equal to the emissions of roughly 100,000 cars in one year 14 14 Considering an average car travelling 15,000 km/y with an average emission of 0.176 kgCO2/km [92]. . The Monte Carlo analysis has highlighted that WVO prices below 500 €/t are necessary to make this process profitable and that the relation between NPV and WVO price is quite steep. Therefore, securing a stable supply with a long-term contract appears a fundamental step to ensure the profitability of this kind of plant. The cost for the HVO production of 901 €/t that has been obtained in this study is comparable with the results of other techno-economic analyses as reported in Table 5 . This value is in line with the results obtained by other authors that analyzed both FAME and HVO production processes [29,85,86]. The main difference in the estimations lies in the different assumptions on the cost of the raw material."
19,Conclusion,"The proposed HVO plant proves to be viable for the production of 100,000 tonnes per year of HVO with an energy efficiency of 80% and with no need of external sources of heat, since the plant is self-sufficient in supplying all the thermal energy required for the chemical processes. This type of facility has the potential of having a surplus of heat that can be directed to other uses, mainly residential space heating, due to its low temperature level (100–150 °C). The economic analysis associated to the HVO plant indicates that an overall plant investment would reach a break-even point after less than 4 years in the base case situation. Furthermore, the variable that has the highest influence in the production cost of HVO is the price of the WVO, since it constitutes almost half of the LCOF in the base case. The presented concept is a way of promoting the decarbonization in the transport sector in a short-to-medium-term perspective, since the penetration of RES in this sector, especially electricity, may be slower because a vehicle technology turnover is required [87]. The average vehicle age in Europe is of 11 years for passenger cars, 10.9 years for vans and 12 years for heavy commercial vehicles [88], indicating that the total fleet turnover will take more than a decade. This fact justifies the need for other alternatives which do not require a technology shift. In addition to that, the presented process constitutes a valid alternative to other processes for biofuel production using hydrogen (e.g. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis), and it has the advantage of using a waste material, promoting the circular economy framework, without the need for an additional gasification process."
