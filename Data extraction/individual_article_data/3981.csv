0,Introduction,"The global production of bleached sulphite pulp was around 0.331 × 106 t in 2019 [1]. The sulphite pulping process is carried out at 135–145 ⁰C at acidic pH values using aqueous solution of SO2/MHSO3/MSO3 (M: Na, Ca, Mg or NH3) [2]. Lawford and Rousseau [3] reported that 8–9 m3 of weak spent sulphite liquor (SSL) is produced as side stream per t of pulp production. Thick SSL is subsequently produced via concentration of weak SSL in multiple-effect evaporators. SSL is rich in C5 and C6 sugars, lignosulphonates (LS), phenolic compounds, acetic acid, 5-hydroxy-methyl-furfural, and furfural among others [4]. SSL is currently employed mainly for the separation of LS that is used in conventional applications, such as plasticizer in cement production [5]. Pateraki et al. [6] pretreated SSL via nanofiltration for the separation of 95 % LS in the retentate stream and 65 % of the sugars in the permeate stream. Pulp and paper industry effluents including SSL have been used for the production of fermentation products, such as butanol [7], ethanol [8], poly(hydroxyalkanoates) [9], succinic acid [10,11] and yeast derived lipids by Rhodosporidium kratochvilovae [12]. The traditional pulp and paper industry could be converted into novel biorefineries through valorisation of SSL [13]. The current sources of γ-linolenic acid (GLA) are plant oils such as borage oil (∼21 % GLA content), black currant seed oil (∼18 %), evening primrose oil (∼9 %) and Durio graveolens fruits (12 %) [14]. GLA and GLA-rich plant oils demonstrate beneficial activity on atheriosclerosis, diabetic neuropathy, acute respiratory distress syndrome, atopic eczema, migraines rheumatic arthritis, bone health, inflammation, skin function, regulation of lipid metabolism and cancer [15,16]. GLA rich oils are widely applied in cosmetic products mostly as moisturizers, cleansers, anti-aging and skin care agents [17]. Efficient GLA-rich oil production from plant seeds is influenced by weather conditions, seasonal production, heterogeneous oil composition and low production yield [15]. Thus, the production of GLA-rich fungal oil by oleaginous fungi (e.g. Mortierella sp., Cunninghamella sp., Thamnidium sp.) using industrial side streams is a promising alternative as all the aforementioned problems can be alleviated [18]. Fungal and yeast lipids have been utilized for the production of commodity products, such as biodiesel [19–21]. The main impediment of industrial microbial oil production is the high production cost [22]. For this reason, its application for the production of speciality products, such as cosmetics, could provide viable market outlets. Isopropyl and 2-ethylhexyl esters with C16 and C18 fatty acids (e.g. palmitic acid, oleic acid) are widely used as moisturizers, thickening agents and emollients in cosmetics in order to replace natural oils due to their lower production cost via enzymatic biocatalysis, advantageous spreading properties and easy absorbance into the skin [23,24]. The esters produced with unsaturated fatty acids have different properties than the esters produced with saturated fatty acids. For instance, isopropyl oleate is bioavailable and its composition resembles that of human’s natural sebum [23]. The industrial production of fatty acid ester, among other oleochemicals, is driven towards enzymatic biocatalysis using lipases due to process selectivity and simplification, high quality end-products, elimination of side-products formation and product degradation, and mild operating conditions [25]. Industrial production of emollient esters is mainly carried out by enzymatic biocatalysis [24]. The Eastman Company reported that enzymatic production of 2-ethylhexyl palmitate has significant environmental benefits, such as reduced CO2 emissions, waste generation and energy consumption [26]. The enzymatic production of isopropyl and 2-ethylhexyl esters for cosmetic applications have been studied using either purified C16 and C18 fatty acids [24,27,28] or vegetable oils such as high-oleic sunflower oil [29], crambe and camelina oil [30], camellia oil [23] and rapeseed oil [31]. Microbial oil produced by oleaginous yeasts has been employed for the enzymatic production of fatty acid esters, such as biolubricants and wax esters [32,33]. Yeast derived lipids contain low linoleic acid and no GLA contents. Fungal oil is an interesting feedstock for the production of cosmetic esters due to the relatively high oleic acid content and the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids including linoleic acid and GLA. This study investigated the novel production of isopropyl and 2-ethylhexyl esters via the enzymatic catalysis of GLA-rich fungal oil, using the commercial lipase Novozym 435 in a solvent-free system. The fungal strains Mortierella sp., Cunninghamella sp. and Thamnidium sp. were assessed as microbial oil producers valorizing the liquid waste stream of pulp and paper industry namely SSL. Specific emphasis was given to the capability of the fungal strains to produce GLA in high contents. The reaction conditions evaluated for the enzymatic conversion of fungal oil to esters were temperature, substrate molar ratio and initial biocatalyst quantity used. The effect of individual lipid classes on ester formation has been assessed. The physicochemical properties of the produced esters were determined and compared with respective esters produced from purified fatty acids or vegetable oils. The main objective of this work was the enzymatic production of esters from fungal oil that could substitute their petrochemical counterparts in cosmetic applications."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The SSL was obtained via acidic sulphite pulping of Eucalyptus globulus (Green Source SA, Spain). SSL was pretreated via nanofiltration for LS removal as previously described [6,11]. The sugar content in SSL was (w/w): 72.6 % xylose, 12.2 % galactose, 10.9 % glucose, 4.2 % mannose and 0.1 % arabinose. The fungal strains, Cunninghamella echinulata ATHUM 4411, Mortierella ramanniana MUCL 9235, Mortierella ramanniana ATHUM 2922, Mortierella isabellina ATHUM 2935 and Thamnidium elegans were maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA) slopes and petri dishes at 4 °C. Prior to each fermentation, all fungal strains were fully sporulated in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 mL of PDA. Briefly, sterilized water (10 mL) and Tween 80 (0.01 % v/v) were added on the surface of the slope followed by spore suspension formation using a wire loop. Successively, a fungal spore suspension (1 mL) was added in the flasks and incubated statically for 4 days at 30 °C. Next, deionized water (50–120 mL) and Tween 80 (0.01 % v/v) were added in each flask and spore suspension (6 × 105 spores/mL) was formed via shaking after the addition of glass beads (4 mm diameter). This spore suspension was used to inoculate the submerged fermentations. Transesterification and esterification reactions were carried out with lipase Novozym 435 (lipase B from Candida antarctica), which was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Fungal oil hydrolysis was carried out with the Candida rugosa derived lipase Lipomod 34MDP (Biocatalyst). Isopropanol (IPA) and 2-ethylhexanol (EHA) were purchased from Penta and Sigma-Aldrich chemicals, respectively."
3,Fungal oil production,"2.2 Fungal oil production The potential of fungal growth and microbial oil accumulation utilizing SSL was evaluated in 250 mL Erlenmeyer shake flask cultures using 50 mL liquid volume. Diluted nanofiltrated SSL (30 g/L sugars) was supplemented with the following nutrients (in g/L): yeast extract, 0.5; (NH4)2SO4, 0.5; Na2HPO4, 2.5; KH2PO4, 7.0; MgSO4·7H2O, 1.5; FeCl3, 0.09; ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.02; MnSO4·H2O, 0.06; CaCl2·2H2O, 0.15. The shake flasks containing the medium were sterilised at 121 °C for 15 min. All flasks were aseptically inoculated with 1 % (v/v) fungal spore suspension and incubated at 180 rpm and 30 °C in an orbital shaker. The pH was adjusted manually at 5.5–6.0 using 5 M NaOH. The total dry weight (TDW), lipid accumulation and sugar consumption were determined during fermentation. The lipid content is defined as g of oil accumulated per 100 g of TDW. The lipid yield is defined as g oil produced per g of sugars consumed. The results represent the average data of duplicates."
4,IPA and EHA esters production,"2.3 IPA and EHA esters production Microbial oil, fractionated lipid classes and hydrolyzed microbial oil were utilized for enzymatic ester production with IPA and EHA. Reactions were carried out in water jacketed closed vials, agitated on a hotplate stirrer at 165 rpm. The average molecular weight of the applied lipids was calculated based on their fatty acid profile, according to the methodology given by Shrestha and Gerpen [34]. The conversion yields of palmitate (PE), oleate (OE), as well as the sum of linoleate and linolenate (LAE & LNE) to the corresponding esters produced during enzymatic biocatalysis with both IPA and EHA were monitored. The sum of individual PE, OE, and LAE & LNE conversion yields indicates the total conversion yield (TCY). Conversion yield was calculated based on Keng et al. [35] and the results were expressed as the percentage of mmol of esters produced per mmol of oil used, given that 1 mol of microbial oil leads to the production of 3 mol of esters during transesterification and 1 mol of ester during esterification. Samples were taken at regular intervals and results represent the average data of duplicates. 2.3.1 Temperature Transesterification reactions with microbial oil and the two alcohols were studied at 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 °C using an enzyme loading of 10 % (w/w), 1:3 microbial oil to alcohol molar ratio and a total reaction duration of 24 h. 2.3.2 Lipid to alcohol molar ratio Microbial oil was transesterified with both alcohols at five lipid to alcohol molar ratios (1:2.84, 1:3, 1:3.13, 1:3.25, 1:4). Reactions were carried out with 10 % (w/w) enzyme loading at 60 °C, for 24 h. 2.3.3 Enzyme loading Transesterification reactions of microbial oil with both alcohols were conducted at 1:3 microbial oil to alcohol molar ratio and 60 °C using three different enzyme loadings (5, 10 and 20 %, w/w). Reaction duration was 24 h. 2.3.4 Transesterification of fungal oil at the optimal process conditions The conversion yields of IPA and EHA esters were monitored in 48 h reaction carried out at the best conditions (temperature, substrate molar ratio and enzyme loading) by taking samples at random intervals. 2.3.5 Effect of individual lipid fractions on esters production Transesterification reactions using the individual lipid fractions were carried out to evaluate their impact on esters conversion yield. After the fractionation of fungal oil, which is described in the Section 2.4.2, neutral lipids (NL) were used in transesterification reactions with IPA and EHA at 60 °C for 24 h using three different NL to alcohol molar ratios (1:3; 1:3.35 and 1:3.6). Moreover, the effect of glycolipids plus sphingolipids (GL + SL) and phospholipids (PL) fractions on TCY of isopropyl esters was evaluated in mixtures with NL. The ratios between lipid fractions used in these experiments were equivalent with their percentage in the total lipid fraction. The effect of lipid classes on TCY was also evaluated using higher quantities of GL + SL and PL in mixture with NL, namely using ratios of NL:2(GL + SL) and NL:2 PL. 2.3.6 Esterification reactions using hydrolysed fungal oil The fungal oil was enzymatically hydrolysed, as described in Section 2.4.2, for subsequent esterification reactions with both alcohols. Enzymatic esterification was conducted at 60 °C using 10 % (w/w) biocatalyst and a molar ratio of 1:1 (w/w). The reaction duration was 24 h. 2.3.7 Enzyme reuse Enzyme stability was assessed in six sequential esterification reactions conducted at 60 °C using 10 % (w/w) of Novozym 435. The initial enzyme activity was 27.0 U/g of immobilized enzyme (2.3 U/g substrate). The lipids to alcohol molar ratio was 1:1. The reaction duration of each batch cycle was 4 h. After each batch reaction, filtration was employed to separate the lipase, which was washed three consecutive times with 6 mL n-hexane (Sigma Aldrich) each time. The lipase was subsequently dried at room temperature. The enzyme activity was also monitored after each esterification."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods 2.4.1 Fermentations The sugars during fermentation were quantified by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (Prominence, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an Aminex HPX-87H (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) column, coupled to a differential refractometer (RID-10A, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The mobile phase was a 10 mM H2SO4 aqueous solution with 0.6 mL/min flow rate. The TDW was determined by repeatedly washing the produced fungal biomass, drying at 85 °C for 24 h and cooling in a desiccator. Prior to oil extraction, TDW was grinded to obtain fine solids. Subsequently, a pre-determined quantity of dry fungal biomass was immersed in a chloroform/methanol solution (2:1, v/v) for microbial oil extraction and quantification, as proposed by Folch et al. [36]. After filtration of cellular debris and evaporation of the Folch solution, gravimetric determination of lipid content was employed using pre-weighed round bottom flasks. The fatty acid composition was determined via transformation into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) using sequential treatment with sodium methoxide followed by methanol with HCl as catalyst. FAMEs were quantified by gas chromatography (GC) Fisons 8130 equipped with a chrompack column (60 m ×0.32 mm) and a flame ionization detector (FID) using helium as carrier gas (2 mL/min) [37]. 2.4.2 Fractionation and hydrolysis of microbial oil Microbial oil was washed with a 3:1 (v/v) mixture of Folch solution (2:1, v/v chloroform - methanol) and KCl (0.88 % w/v) (Renta). The mixture was centrifuged (10000×g, 10 °C, 10 min). The organic phase was collected and vacuum evaporated to obtain the clarified microbial oil for its subsequent fractionation. Lipids fractionation was carried out according to Fakas et al. [38] with slight modifications as follows. A column (1.7 × 37.5 cm) of silica gel 60 silanized (0.063−0.2 mm, Merck) was previously activated overnight at 120 °C. Five bed volumes of chloroform, acetone and methanol were applied for the sequential elution of neutral lipids, phospholipids and glycolipids plus sphingolipids, respectively. The elution procedure was controlled at a flow rate of 0.5–1.0 mL/min. The three isolated fractions were vacuum evaporated for subsequent use. Microbial oil was hydrolyzed using the lipase Lipomod 34MDP (2 %, w/w, calculated by oil weight) and 0.1 M Tris−HCl buffer at pH 8 at a ratio of 1:1 (v/v) [32]. Hydrolysis was conducted in round bottom flaks at 30 °C for 24 h using a hotplate stirrer (Witeg, MSH 20D). Hexane was added to stop the reaction and the mixture was transferred in a separation funnel. The lower layer containing the buffer, glycerol and enzyme was not used, while the upper organic layer was evaporated under vacuum in order to acquire the free fatty acids. Titration against 0.04 M NaOH was employed for the determination of the acidity of the free fatty acid fraction. 2.4.3 IPA and EHA esters production Ester analysis was conducted by GC using a Fisons GC-8130 unit equipped with FID and a cold on-column injection system, using helium as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Separation of the compounds was performed on a ZB-5HT inferno capillary column (15 m ×0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness, Phenomenex). The oven program was initiated at 80 °C, heated to 240 °C with a ratio of 20 °C/min, then increased with ratio of 15 °C/min up to 290 °C and finally increased to 400 °C and maintained for 6 min. Detector temperature was set at 400 °C. The fatty acids which were considered for the determination of their respective esters were palmitic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and γ-linolenic acid. The quantification of palmitic and oleic esters was carried out using commercial standards provided by Ecogreen Oleochemicals (Deutsche Hydrierwerke GmbH Rodleben-Germany). Isopropyl and 2-ethylhexyl esters of linoleic and γ-linolenic acids were determined based on reference standards of oleic acid esters due to the lack of commercial standards. The internal standard used was methyl palmitate. Enzymatic assay of lipase was carried out according to ACS Specifications [39]. More specifically, 2.5 mL deionized water, 1 mL 2 M Tris HCl Buffer (pH 7.7) and 3 mL olive oil were magnetically stirred and equilibrated to 37 °C using water jacketed glass vials on a hotplate stirrer (165 rpm). A specific amount of enzyme was added to the reaction mixture and a 30-minute incubation followed. Subsequently 3 mL 95 % ethanol was added. Then the mixture was titrated with 50 mM NaOH in the presence of thymolphthalein indicator to a light blue color. A blank sample was prepared by following the same procedure, but without the addition of enzyme. One unit of lipase activity was the enzyme quantity hydrolysing 1.0 μmole fatty acid from a triglyceride per minute, at 37 °C and pH 7.7 using olive oil as substrate. The lipase activity was defined as unit activity per g of immobilized enzyme or of the reaction mixture. Results were estimated in duplicates and the data represent average values. 2.4.4 ICP-MS analysis Complete digestion of samples was carried out with a microwave-assisted digestion system. Ten mL of hydrogen peroxide (30 % w/v) were mixed with 1 mL of samples. Mixtures were pre-digested for 30 min. Then, 5 ml of HNO3 (65 % w/v) were added followed by heating in a microwave accelerated digestion system (CEM, Mars X-Press, Matthews, NC, USA) as follows: power was ramped during 20 min from 100 to 1200 W and held constant for 15 min. The temperature reached 200 °C followed by a cool-down cycle for 15 min. The samples were diluted properly and filtered (0.20 μm, 15 mm) before injected in the Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP–MS). Calibration standard solutions (ICP internal standards of Ge and In and ICP-MS certified multi-element standards-Inorganic Ventures, New Jersey, USA) were prepared from high purity standards [40,41]. Elemental content was determined using a Perkin Elmer (SCIEX, Canada) 9000 Series ICP-MS due to its capability for rapid ultra-trace level multi-element determination. The examined compounds were REEs (Ce, Dy, Er, Eu, Gd, Ho, La, Lu, Nd, Pr, Sc, Sm, Tb, Tm, Y, Yb), actinides (Th, U), ultra-trace elements (Sb, Sr, Tl), trace elements (As, Be, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Li, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Sr, Ti, Tl, V, Zn) and macro elements (Ca, Mg). Operating conditions of the ICP-MS were as follows: nebulizer gas flow of 0.91 L min-1, ICP RF power of 1050 W, lens voltage of 8.5 V, pulse stage voltage of 950 V and sample uptake rate of 26 rpm. Indium 10 ppt was used as internal standard for the first set and Germanium 50 ppb for the second set. 2.4.5 Ester properties analysis The ester properties determined were iodine, acid, and saponification values [42]. The saponification value was defined as mg of KOH required to neutralize the free acids and saponify the esters contained per g of sample. Refractive index and density were calculated according to Annual American National Standards [43]. The iodine and acid values were defined as g of I2 absorbed per 100 g of sample and as mg of KOH required to neutralize the free acids per g of sample, respectively."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Microbial oil production and fatty acid composition,"3.1 Microbial oil production and fatty acid composition Five fungal strains of the division Zygomycota were evaluated in shake flask culture using nanofiltrated SSL with 30 g/L sugar concentration (Table 1 ). The presence of inhibitors in SSL necessitates its pretreatment via nanofiltration or ultrafiltration to produce a suitable fermentation feedstock [44]. All fungal strains could grow and accumulate lipids in the nanofiltrated SSL. The TDW of all cultures (5.5–10.1 g/L) contained intracellular lipid concentrations of 2.0–5.5 g/L. M. isabellina showed the highest TDW (10.1 g/L), lipid concentration (5.5 g/L) and yield (0.2 g/g), while C. echinulata showed the lowest TDW and lipid production efficiency. The C/N ratio used was 86.5 g/g based on the carbon content in the sugars contained in SSL (as described in Section 2.1) and the nitrogen content in yeast extract and (NH4)2SO4. The same strains of C. echinulata and M. isabellina have been investigated by Papanikolaou et al. [45]. Similar C/N ratios (83.5 g/g) were identified as suitable for fungal proliferation (7.8–9 g/L) and microbial oil accumulation (36–50 % w/w). Table 2 shows the fatty acid contents in the fungal lipids. The microbial oils mainly contained oleic acid (C18:1) and palmitic acid (C16:0) followed by linoleic acid (C18:2), GLA (C18:3) and stearic acid (C18:0). The oleic acid content was around 50 % (w/w) in all fungal lipids apart from the lipids produced by C. echinulata (44.7 %, w/w). The fungal lipids produced by C. echinulata showed the highest linoleic acid (17 %, w/w) and GLA (12 %, w/w) contents. The GLA content in the fungal lipids produced by the other fungal strains was in the range of 3.6–6.6 %. The fungal strains used in this study have been used in limited literature-cited publications for the production of fungal lipids using both commercial xylose-based media and lignocellulose hydrolysates. Gao et al. [46] cultivated the oleaginous fungal strain M. isabellina in a xylose-based medium with 100 g/L initial xylose concentration leading to the production of 28.8 g/L TDW and 18.5 g/L lipid concentration with lower linoleic acid (10.9 %) and GLA (2.5 %) contents than the ones observed in this study. Fakas et al. [47] cultivated the oleaginous fungal strain C. echinulata on xylose-based media with a C/N content of 285 and initial xylose concentration of 80 g/L leading to 6.7 g/L lipid concentration with a GLA content of 16.7 %. Zikou et al. [48] has reported the production of fungal lipids from xylose using the oleaginous fungal strain T. elegans. Xing et al. [49] reported the cultivation of M. isabellina in shake flask cultures using corn fiber hydrolysate and initial total sugar concentration of 60 g/L leading to TDW of 18.2 g/L with 45.7 % lipid content (28.8 % linoleic acid and 3.8 % GLA contents). To the best of our knowledge, cultivation of C. echinulata and T. elegans on crude hemicellulose hydrolysates has not been reported in the literature. It has been demonstrated that nanofiltrated SSL is a suitable feedstock for linoleic and GLA rich fungal lipids production. Subsequent studies on IPA and EHA ester production were carried out with the fungal lipids produced by C. echinulata due to the high linoleic and especially GLA content."
8,Lipid classes of the C. echinulata oil,"3.2 Lipid classes of the C. echinulata oil The lipids produced by C. echinulata were fractionated into NL, GL + SL and PL, which were further characterized concerning their fatty acid composition (Table 3 ). The predominant lipid fraction was NL (88.5 %) followed by GL + SL (7.5 %) and SL (4.0 %). The three lipid fractions mainly contained oleic acid (45.1–45.8 %) followed by palmitic acid (18.9–21.6 %), linoleic acid (13.1–16.0 %) and GLA (10.8–14.3 %). The molecular weight of microbial oil was calculated as 868.9 g/mol."
9,Evaluation of IPA and EHA ester production from fungal oil,"3.3 Evaluation of IPA and EHA ester production from fungal oil 3.3.1 Temperature Transesterification reactions to produce IPA and EHA esters were initially evaluated at different temperatures (Fig. 1 ) using a stoichiometric lipid to alcohol molar ratio (1:3) and 10 % (w/w) of lipase Novozym 435. At this point, the research aimed to evaluate the stability of the enzyme in a wide range of temperatures. The reaction duration was selected to be 24 h to ensure that the reaction will reach equilibrium. Results showed that the maximum TCY for isopropyl esters (58.1 %) was obtained at 60 ○C. In this case, the conversion yields of palmitate, oleate and linoleate plus linolenate esters were 8.1 %, 33.5 % and 16.5 %, respectively. The TCY for 2-ethylhexyl esters was quite similar at 60 °C and 70 °C, reaching up to 56.2 % and 57.9 %, respectively. For both temperatures, the esters production was 9.0–10.7 % for 2-ethylhexyl palmitate, 31.3–31.7 % for 2-ethylhexyl oleate and 15.4–16.3 % for 2-ethylhexyl linoleate plus linolenate. Subsequent ester production studies were carried out at 60 °C. The optimal temperature in enzymatic esters synthesis is dependent on the lipase and reactants used. Optimum conversion yields have been reported at 60 °C, while higher temperatures could reduce enzyme functionality [50]. Liu et al. [23] reported that 55 °C was the optimum temperature for the production of isopropyl esters from camellia oil, while isopropyl esters derived from high-oleic sunflower oil reached a maximum conversion of 84 % at 71 °C [29]. In both studies, lipase Novozym 435 was used as the biocatalyst. 3.3.2 Lipids to alcohol molar ratio Identifying the optimal molar ratio is a key factor in enzymatic biocatalysis in order to achieve high conversion yield and to minimize the usage of reactants. Fig. 2 presents the conversion yield of transesterification reactions carried out at four different fungal oil to alcohol molar ratios. The TCY was gradually decreased as the molar ratio was increased further than the stoichiometric molar ratio (1:3, lipid to alcohol) indicating that addition of excess amount of alcohol has inhibitory effect on enzymatic ester production. Specifically, the TCY was decreased to 21.2 % for isopropyl ester production and 35.6 % for 2-ethylhexyl ester production at molar lipid to alcohol ratio of 1:4. The conversion yield was also reduced when the molar ratio was lower (1:2.84) than the stoichiometric molar ratio, since this quantity of alcohol was not adequate for complete transesterification of triglycerides. Based on ANOVA analysis, the application of different molar ratios significantly affected conversion yield in the case of both isopropyl esters and 2-ethylhexyl esters. da Silva et al. [28] reported that the highest yield of 2-ethyhexyl oleate esters was attained at equimolar ratio of reactants in a solvent-free system. Liu et al. [23] reported that the conversion yield of isopropyl esters produced from camellia oil increased when the molar ratio increased from 0.5:1 to 7:1. Cirillo et al. [50] proposed a kinetic model to simulate the production of cetyl palmitate with the commercial lipase Lipozyme RM IM where it was demonstrated that alcohol amounts above the stoichiometric ratio caused reactants competitive inhibition of enzyme sites. This phenomenon is attributed to the formation of inactive ternary complex and high alcohol polarity, successively leading to alterations on the protein structure [50]. 3.3.3 Enzyme loading Enzyme loading influences the economic feasibility of the whole biocatalytic process [51]. Therefore, the effect of the enzyme amount on the conversion yield was evaluated. Fig. 3 presents the esters conversion yield achieved at different enzyme loading. When 20 % (w/w) of enzyme loading was employed, the TCY of isopropyl esters was only 3.7 % higher than the use of 10 % (w/w) enzyme loading. The use of 5% enzyme loading resulted in a decrease of TCY (41.4 %). In the case of 2-ethyhexyl esters, the TCY was almost stable when 10 % and 20 % of enzyme loading was used, while it was substantially decreased (26.5 %) when 5 % enzyme loading was used. In the study of Bouaid et al. [29] isopropyl esters conversion yield was maximized following a full three-factorial design under the best conditions of 7 % Novozym 435, 3:1 isopropanol to sunflower oil molar ratio and 71 °C. 3.3.4 Reaction duration Fig. 4 presents the trend of TCY for ester production by 10 % (w/w) Novozym 435 lipase at 60 °C. Isopropyl esters reached the highest TCY (58.7 %) at 12.5 h, while the highest TCY (54.3 %) for 2-ethylhexyl esters was reached at 17 h (Fig. 4). Both esters formation was monitored for 48 h, but no further increase of TCY was observed after 24 h (data not shown). Interestingly, slower reaction was noticed for 2-ethylhexyl esters compared to isopropyl esters, attributed to the utilisation of different types of alcohol. Specifically, 2-ethyl hexanol is a branched primary alcohol with eight carbon atoms presenting higher length of alkyl groups compared to isopropanol which is a secondary alcohol with three carbon atoms. The different reaction rates and conversion yields obtained by the use of these alcohols, indicated the substrate specificity of Novozym 435 concerning the classification of alcohols (primary or secondary) and the length of the alkyl groups of alcohols. Bauwelinck et al. [52] reported the positional regiospecificity of Novozym 435 during transesterification with various alcohols. Particularly, Novozym 435 exhibited lower conversion yields and reaction rates in transesterifications with highly branched and bulky alcohols, such as 2-hexyl-1-decanol and 2‐ethyl‐1‐hexanol, than linear and shorter substrates, such as octanol [52], These observations were explained by the slow diffusion of bulky molecules and the high length of alkyl groups, which make the substrate less accessible to the active site of the enzyme."
10,Ester production from individual lipid classes,"3.4 Ester production from individual lipid classes The TCY achieved for isopropyl esters and 2-ethylhexyl esters was low. For this reason, the effect of lipid fractions on TCY was investigated. After fractionation of fungal oil, the NL fraction was utilised in reactions with three different NL to alcohol molar ratios (1:3, 1:3.35 and 1:3.6). The results presented in Fig. 5 a demonstrate that the stoichiometric molar ratio (1:3) was insufficient to achieve high conversion yield using both alcohols. The highest TCY for isopropyl esters (80.1 %) and 2-ethylhexyl esters (73.8 %) were achieved at a NL to alcohol molar ratio of 1:3.35. Noticeably, the absence of the GL + SL and PL fractions led to improved TCY of the NL fraction. The effect of GL + SL and PL fractions on the enzymatic transesterification of fungal oil was further studied in reactions carried out with mixtures of NL with GL + SL, NL with 2(GL + SL), NL with PL, and NL with 2 PL (Fig. 5b). The study focused on isopropyl esters formation since their TCY was higher than the corresponding TCY of 2-ethylhexyl esters as presented in Fig. 5a. Mixtures of NL with GL + SL resulted in TCY of 63.4 %, whereas the utilization of double quantity of GL + SL led to considerably lower TCY (21.4 %). TCY was reduced by 20.8 % and 73.3 % in the presence of GL + SL and 2(GL + SL), respectively, with reference to the yield achieved using the NL fraction alone (80.1 %). Similar results were obtained in reactions containing mixtures of NL with PL and NL with 2 PL that led to TCY with respective values of 45.7 % and 6.4 %. In the presence of PL, the TCY was lower than the respective values achieved in the reactions with GL + SL. The TCY reduction in the case of PL and 2 PL was 42.9 % and 92.0 % lower than the yield achieved using the NL fraction alone (80.1 %). Conclusively, the results presented in Fig. 5 show that the presence of GL + SL and PL lipid fractions reduce the lipid to ester conversion yield. The negative effect of PL on the enzymatic transesterification by Novozym 435 lipase has been also reported in transesterifications using microbial oil and palm oil [33,53]. Talukder et al. [53] reported that Novozym 435 activity decreased with increasing amounts of PL during biodiesel production from refined and unrefined palm oil. Likewise, biodiesel transesterification yield from PL was 30 % less than the corresponding one from triglycerides [54]. Similar results regarding the effect of PL on biodiesel production from canola oil have been reported by Jang et al. [55] using other lipases. These results suggest that PL can be adsorbed on the surface of the enzyme, thus preventing the enzyme-substrate interaction."
11,Esters production from hydrolyzed fungal oil,"3.5 Esters production from hydrolyzed fungal oil Subsequent experiments were conducted with free fatty acids obtained after enzymatic hydrolysis of fungal oil, 1:1 alcohol to free fatty acids molar ratio and 60 °C. Fig. 6 presents the time course of ester formation during enzymatic esterification of hydrolysed fungal oil with IPA and EHA. After 2 h, the TCY reached 90.8 % for isopropyl esters, while the maximum value of around 95 % was obtained after 4 h. The TCY of 2-ethylhexyl esters reached 77.6 % at 2 h with a maximum value of around 80.0 % after 6 h. The utilization of hydrolysed fungal oil increased the conversion yield at lower reaction duration than transesterification reactions using either fungal oil or individual lipid fractions. 3.5.1 Enzyme reuse and stability Immobilized biocatalysts could lead to cost effective enzymatic processes as they are easily recovered from reaction mixtures and they can be reused in several sequential batch reactions. Hydrolysed fungal oil was used for the implementation of 6 sequential batch reactions. The TCY and any reduction in lipase activity were monitored after each batch cycles (Fig. 7 ). The TCY of isopropyl esters was higher than 90 % for the first three batch cycles. In the 4th and 5th cycles, reduced TCY (83.8–88.2 %) were observed, while in the 6th cycle the TCY was reduced to 70.2 % (Fig. 7a). The TCY yield for the production of 2-ethylhexyl esters was 80.3 % in the 1 st cycle and remained at around 75 % in the next three cycles (Fig. 7b). The TCY was reduced to 63.4 % at the 5th batch cycle and finally it was sharply decreased to 22.1 % in the 6th cycle. The lipase activity after the 1 st reaction remained almost stable for both esters (26.8–26.9 U/g of immobilized enzyme) in comparison to the initial activity of the enzyme (27.0 U/g of immobilized enzyme). In the case of isopropyl esters, the enzyme activity after the 3rd (23.3 U/g of immobilized enzyme) and 5th cycle (21.5 U/g of immobilized enzyme) were reduced, while a further significant reduction was observed after the 6th cycle (13.9 U/g of immobilized enzyme). In the case of EHA esters, the enzyme activity remained almost stable at 26.4 U/g of immobilized enzyme until the 3rd cycle, while it was further decreased after the 5th cycle (22.7 U/g of immobilized enzyme). After the 6th cycle, the enzyme activity was reduced significantly to 11.6 U/g. Thus, the biocatalyst showed good stability for 5 batch cycles as it could be reused without significant reduction of enzyme activity. Papadaki et al. [33] demonstrated the efficient reuse of Novozym 435 for six and three cycles during the production of wax esters using, respectively, palm oil and microbial oil derived from the yeast strain Cryptococcus curvatus. Conversion yields significantly decreased thereafter. The ultrasound assisted esterification reaction catalyzed by Novozym 435 for the synthesis of citronellol laurate was effectively repeated for 5 sequential cycles [56]. Also, reusability of Novozym 435 for up to 10 cycles have been reported in transesterification of epoxidized soybean oil for the production of epoxidized soybean oil methyl esters [57]. Multiple phenomena, related to the biocatalyst macro- and micro-environment, each occurring in particular batch cycles, could lead to an eventual reduction in esters yield. Papadaki et al. [33] reported that the PL fraction contained in microbial oil could be absorbed in the macroporous matrix of the Novozym 435 support deteriorating the functionality of the biocatalyst. PL is considered as a detergent-like molecule and it may cause enzymes release from the support matrix [58]. Water molecules, being produced as a by-product during the enzymatic esterification of hydrolysed microbial oil, could be retained in the support due to the hydrophilic nature of the latter, causing partial enzyme deactivation. High temperature of reaction may also adversely affect the enzyme-support interaction and the support solubility. For instance, experiments for biodiesel production at 65 °C showed that some polymeric substances, deriving from the support material, can be found in the product [58]. Furthermore, enzyme activity and ester formation are influenced by enzyme dissociation and dissolution occurring during the solvent-washing step after each reaction [32]."
12,Ester properties,"3.6 Ester properties Table 4 presents the refractive index, saponification value, acid value, iodine value and density of the produced IPA and EHA esters from hydrolysed fungal oil as compared to the respective properties from commercial isopropyl palmitate (IPP), isopropyl oleate (IPO), 2-ethylhexyl palmitate (EHP) and 2-ethylhexyl oleate (EHO). The density of isopropyl fungal oil esters (0.961 g/cm3) and 2-ethyhexyl fungal oil esters (0.938 g/cm3) were close to a specific gravity of 1 indicating good miscibility with other additives [23]. The acid values of isopropyl fungal oil esters (10.6 mg KOH/g) and 2-ethylhexyl fungal oil esters (9.6 mg KOH/g) were higher than the recommended acid values for commercial esters as well as similar esters produced from lacquer wax (Table 4). These values are also higher than those obtained in enzymatic synthesis of other fatty acid esters [32,35]. Further optimisation of lipid to ester conversion yields and purification of the produced esters could be implemented in order to reduce the observed acid values. Furthermore, the acid value could be reduced by applying higher molar ratio of alcohol to oil [59]. Generally, only high acid values are susceptible to promote oxidations [52]. Still, there are other ingredients often utilized in cosmetics, such as beeswax and carnauba wax, which have substantially higher acid value (17–22 and 2−8 mg KOH/g, respectively) [33]. The saponification value of isopropyl fungal oil esters (167.7 mg KOH/g) and 2-ethylhexyl fungal oil esters (134.2 mg KOH/g) are close to the saponification value ranges of the commercial isopropyl and 2-ethylhexyl esters reported in Table 4. The iodine values of isopropyl fungal oil esters (50.9 g I2/100 g) and 2-ethylhexyl fungal oil esters (59.8 g I2/100 g) meet cosmetic standards in which the iodine values of cosmetic oils should be lower than 100 g I2/100 g [23]. Iodine values of IPA and EHA are closely related to the high unsaturation fraction (75.1 %) of the microbial oil used as feedstock. For instance, the iodine value of IPA and EHA fungal oil esters are close to the iodine values of commercial IPO and EHO (Table 4). Similar or slightly higher iodine values have been reported for palm oil esters (69.7 g I2/100 g), palm stearin esters (62.1 g I2/100 g), palm kernel oil esters (58.8 g I2/100 g) and palm kernel olein esters (61.3 g I2/100 g) with oleyl alcohol using Lipozyme RM IM [35]. Lower iodine values (23.4–27.5 g I2 /100 g) have been reported when various oleaginous yeast lipids (i.e. Cryptococcus curvatus, Lipomyces starkeyi and Rhodosporidium toruloides) were used for the production of behenyl esters via transesterification reactions catalyzed by Novozym 435 lipase [32]. The iodine value (76 g I2/100 g) of isopropyl esters derived from camellia oil enzymatic alcoholysis indicated their suitability in cosmetics [23]. The refractive index of isopropyl fungal oil esters (1.456) is similar to the respective values commercial IPO and 2-ethylhexyl fungal oil esters (1.458). Table 4 also shows that the refractive index of isopropyl camellia oil esters estimated by Liu et al. [23] is similar to the values determined in this study. The refractive index is correlated to the degree of saturation in a lipid and decreases linearly with decreasing iodine value [60]."
13,ICP-MS analysis,"3.7 ICP-MS analysis The produced isopropyl esters and 2-ethylhexyl esters from hydrolysed fungal oil were subjected to ICP-MS analysis in order to determine whether they contain any trace elements, macro elements and rare earth elements (Table 5 ) as the elemental content could affect safety and quality aspects of cosmetics and foods. Alexandri et al. [61] has carried out ICP-MS analysis of the original SSL and the nanofiltrated SSL used in this study. The presence of various elements in the nanofiltrated SSL necessitated the evaluation of the safety of the produced esters in the case that some of these elements were still present in the esters. In both esters, the predominant element was Ca followed by Zn and Mg. Concerning rare earth elements, Sc, La, Ce and Nd were found in higher concentration in both isopropyl esters and 2-ethylhexyl esters. The Cu content was found similar in both esters (1,510-1,660 μg/L). 2-Ethylhexyl esters presented higher content of Fe and Mn in comparison to isopropyl esters. All the determined elements were under the limits of ICH Q3D concerning drugs and also under the limit of EU Commission Regulation 1881/2006 for a use of up to 1 % to foods, implying their suitability in several applications in the food and cosmetic sector."
14,Conclusions,"This study demonstrated the production of fungal oil from SSL via fermentation and its efficient utilization for enzymatic synthesis of isopropyl and 2-ethylhexanol esters. In an attempt to maximize the conversion yield, different pretreatments of the substrate were performed. Fractionation of fungal oil in lipid classes clearly indicated the negative effect of PL on the final conversion yield. The use of free fatty acids derived via fungal oil hydrolysis resulted in the highest conversion yields (90.8 % for isopropyl esters and 80 % for 2-ethylhexyl esters) possibly due to the reduction of by-product inhibition (e.g. glycerol). The stability of commercial lipase was indicated by its catalytic performance for five consecutive batch reaction cycles. The physicochemical properties of the produced esters showed their potential evaluation in cosmetic applications."
