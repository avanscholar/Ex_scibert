0,Introduction,"Recently, carbon nanomaterials are attracting increasing attention owing to its broad industrial applications. Carbon nanomaterials can be divided into carbon nanoparticles (or carbon black), carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, carbon fibers and so on [1]. Among these carbon nanomaterials, carbon nanoparticles were first applied to industry in the early 20th century [2]. Carbon nanoparticles were widely used in material reinforcement, battery storage, carbon adsorbent, and efficient catalysts [3,4]. Schuster et al. [5] improved the performance of lithium–sulfur batteries by spherical ordered mesoporous carbon nanoparticles, the results showed that the modified batteries presented a high reversible charge capacity of up to 1200 mA h g−1 and good cycling stability. Jarvid et al. [6] added carbon nanoparticles in voltage stabilizers for power cable insulation, achieving an even higher improvement of 26% in high voltage resistance. Cao et al. [7] applied carbon nanoparticles as visible-light photocatalysts for CO2 conversion, which has bright future in atmospheric CO2 management. Therefore, high–efficiency production of carbon nanoparticles is needed. Many methods of carbon nanoparticles production have been studied, such as laser ablation, partial combustion, discharge plasma and so on. Al-Hamaoy et al. [8,9] used liquid phase-pulsed laser ablation for carbon nanostructures production, and nanoparticles with the size of 42–75 nm can be efficiently acquired in their work. Partial combustion can also achieve the production of carbon nanoparticles with the diameter of 26–30 nm [10]. Discharge plasma is another effective method for producing carbon nanomaterials because discharge plasma can generate a high-temperature region with high fluxes of heat and active species. Discharge plasma for carbon nanomaterials production can be basically classified into arc discharge [11–14], glow discharge [15], spark discharge [16], microwave discharge [17], and radio frequency discharge [18]. Arc discharge is commonly seen in carbon nanomaterials production, containing direct current (DC) discharge [11,12], alternating current (AC) discharge [1], and pulsed discharge [13,14]. Lange et al. [11] studied carbon nanostructures produced by DC arc discharge in water. The temperature of the discharge region was about 4000–6500 K, and the diameter can be achieved about 10 nm. Zhao et al. [1] researched carbon nanoparticles production by AC arc discharge plasma in benzene, acquiring the nanoparticles with 20–60 nm diameter. Yamaguchi et al. [13] investigated pulsed arc discharge ignited between pre-heated carbon rods for carbon nanohorn particles production. The results showed that the purity of carbon nanoparticles was reached higher than 90% and the mean size was about 50 nm. Glow discharge has been also applied to carbon nanoparticles production. In Koga's work [15], most nanoparticles were below 150 nm in size produced by glow discharge in methane. Spark discharge is another type of plasma discharge just like discontinuous arc discharge. Horvath et al. [16] used a low–voltage spark discharge for carbon nanoparticles production, the operation can last for tens of hours and the particles sizes were between 10 and 100 nm. Microwave discharge and radio frequency discharge belong to high–frequency discharge, which has been applied to produce carbon nanomaterials as well. Taking radio frequency discharge as an example, 50–100 nm solid carbon particles were generated in the process [18]. To sum up, discharge plasma has great advantages in carbon nanomaterials production and some progress can be also expected. Pulsed spark discharge in liquid (PSDL) combines the advantages of pulsed spark discharge and liquid phase discharge, which has high peak current density and plasma density, high generation efficiency of electrons and radicals, and large area of non-equilibrium plasma [19,20]. The produced large area of high–energy electrons and active species can promote the chemical reactions. Besides, PSDL can generate a high-temperature region of 1600–4000 K [21,22]. Therefore, PSDL is suitable for carbon nanomaterials production and some unique advantages exist like low energy consumption with low–frequency PSDL. However, few references studied this topic. In Xin's work [4], carbon nanoparticles below 20 nm diameter appeared when they researched hydrogen produced from ethanol solution by PSDL, but further studies need to be well done. In this work, carbon nanoparticles produced by pulsed spark discharge in alcohols (methanol/ethanol) was investigated. Different experimental conditions, such as discharge power and liquid type, on carbon yield and diameter were researched and characterizations of produced carbon nanoparticles were also analyzed. The produced carbon nanoparticles have the certain commercial prospect in some industrial applications."
1,Experimental setup and methods,"The experimental setup of PSDL was the needle-plate configurations. The needle electrode was made of platinum and shaped to have a sharp tip with a radius of curvature of approximately 0.2 mm at the end with high positive potential. In order to ensure the electric energy concentrated on the tip of the needle electrode, silicone adhesive was set around the needle electrode and only the tip of the needle was exposed outside. The ground plate electrode was made of stainless steel and its diameter was about 80 mm. The distance between the tip of the needle electrode and the surface of the plate electrode was 15 mm in this work. The flow chart of carbon particles produced by PSDL is presented in Fig. 1 , the similar schematic diagram of experimental setup can be also found in our previous work [23]. The plasma reactor about 300 cm3 was powered by a high voltage power supply (DGM–60, Dalian Power Supply Technology) equipped with a maximum allowable voltage of 60 kV and frequency of 300 Hz. An oscilloscope (TDS2024B, Tektronix) with a high voltage probe (P6015A, Tektronix) and a current probe (2878, Pearson Electronics) was used to analyze the variation of voltage and current in the discharge circuit. Fig. 2 shows the dynamic behaviors of voltage and current caused by pulsed spark discharge in ethanol. The discharge process can be divided into two stages: propagation and initiation. When the spark discharge is shaped, the voltage declines sharply and strong current forms at the same time. As the figure shows, the peak current can be reached over 300 A when the peak voltage is about 30 kV. Besides, other gases and liquid productions were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-2014C, SHIMADZU). Before the experiments, plasma reactor was filled with alcohols (methanol/ethanol) that the plasma was indeed formed in the liquid. The carbon nanoparticles were produced in alcohols. After extraction and lavation, the produced nanoparticles were dried at 25 °C then analyzed. The mass of the produced particles was measured by electronic balance (AL104, Mettler Toledo). The morphological features of carbon particles were identified by field-emission scanning electron microscopy, or FE-SEM (SUPERA 55 SAPPHIRE, Zeiss), and the interior structures were characterized by transmission electron microscopy abbreviated as TEM (JEM–2000EX, JEOL). The element composition of the produced particles was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, short for XPS (K–Alpha, Thermo). The mean particles size was the average value of produced particles diameter (particles number > 30) derived from the figure of TEM. Discharge power is an important parameter, which can be calculated by discharge voltage, discharge current, discharge frequency acquired from oscillogram. The typical current–voltage oscillogram of PSDL can be found in some other work [24,25], and the computing method of discharge power is as below: (1) P = f ∫ v ( t ) i ( t ) d t where P refers to discharge power (W), f refers to discharge frequency (Hz), and v(t), i(t) refer to voltage (V) and current (A) respectively, both of them are in the function of time (s) acquired by the oscilloscope. The mean rate of carbon production is an important parameter for evaluating the method of carbon production. It can be calculated by the carbon yield and the discharge time. (2) v ¯ = w t where v ¯ refers to the mean rate of carbon production (g/h), w refers to the carbon yield (g), and t refers to the discharge time (h). In this work, every experiment was repeated 5 times. The errors mainly came from the instantaneous instability of plasma discharge. In addition, numerical reading and changing external environment may have also led to errors."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Characteristics of particles produced by PSDL,"3.1 Characteristics of particles produced by PSDL Fig. 3 shows the morphology of particles produced from ethanol by PSDL. The SEM image of particles is presented in Fig. 3 (a), the particles were produced at peak voltage = 22 kV, discharge frequency = 30 Hz. The shape of the particles appears sphere, and the diameter of the particle is about 3.6 μm. Fig. 3 (b) shows the TEM image of particles, which performed at peak voltage = 28 kV, discharge frequency = 30 Hz. As the figure shows, the size of the particles is not the same but all the particles appear sphere. Besides, the particles should be graphite owing to the turbostratic structure. The morphology of the carbon particles is similar to the commercial carbon, which has been produced in Mohsenian or Fabry's work [3,26]. What's more, the size of carbon particles in Fig. 3 (b) is even smaller than that shown in much work. Compared with the two figures in Fig. 3, the size of the particles is different with different experimental conditions. With high peak voltage, the diameter of particles sharply decreased. The diameter of the particles presented nanoscale with the peak voltage of 28 kV. Further studies aimed to clarify the composition of particles produced by PSDL. The XPS analysis was done and the particles were produced at peak voltage = 22 kV, discharge frequency = 30 Hz. As shown in Fig. 4 , the elements C, O, Si, Pt are found in the produced particles. The element C accounts for the main part. The elements of O, Si mainly came from the silicone adhesive, which was set around the needle electrode. The element Pt derived from needle electrode made of platinum. Considering the small amount of Si, Pt, the particles produced by PSDL were mainly carbon."
4,Influence of discharge power on carbon particles production,"3.2 Influence of discharge power on carbon particles production As shown in section 3.1, the size of the carbon particles produced by PSDL was various with different experimental conditions. It seemed that discharge power had a huge impact on carbon particles. Influence of discharge power on carbon particles production from ethanol was investigated in this section. The mean particles size as a function of discharge power is presented in Fig. 5 . The size of particles sharply decreases with the increase of discharge power. The mean size of particles is about 1.18 μm with the discharge power of 21.5 W. However, the mean particles size reduces to 10.7 nm when discharge power is about 41.5 W. In addition, the standard deviation of particles size largely decreases with the increased discharge power. It illustrates that the size distribution of carbon particles is more uniform when the discharge power is increased. To further confirm the conclusions, size distribution charts of carbon particles produced by PSDL with different discharge power were shown in Fig. 6 . Compared with the two figures, carbon particles produced by low discharge power have the larger particle size and wider size distribution. While carbon particles produced by high discharge power are smaller and more uniform. The injected energy can be increased as the discharge power rises that stronger physical force could also occur. The produced carbon particles can be further struck by the electric spark and generated shock waves. Thus, when the injected energy is increased, the produced carbon particles can be struck by the stronger electric spark and generated shock waves. It can result in the formation of smaller and more uniform carbon particles. As Fabry's work shows, the spherical carbon particles with the mean size of 25–45 nm can be used in the production of rubber, battery, lubricant [26]. The particles produced in this work can meet these industrial applications. Table 1 shows the comparison of different methods of carbon particles production. As the table shows, carbon particles with minor size (4–20 nm) can be achieved by PSDL. Compared with the methods of carbon particles produced from gas, carbon particles produced from liquid usually got the minor size. Considering the raw materials, ethanol was rarely used in carbon particles production. However, as the results shown in the table, discharge in ethanol can effectively prepare the carbon nanoparticles. Therefore, carbon nanoparticles can be effectively generated from ethanol by PSDL, which has bright future in carbon nanomaterials preparation."
5,Influence of alcohol type on carbon particles production,"3.3 Influence of alcohol type on carbon particles production Nano carbon particles with about 10 nm diameter can be produced by PSDL. Thus, further studies aim to increase the carbon particles yield. With the preliminary work, discharge in different alcohols (methanol, ethanol et al.) can produce the carbon particles in similar size. However, the carbon yield was not the same with different alcohols. Fig. 7 shows the effect of alcohol type on carbon yield, the experiments were carried out at the discharge power of 41.5 W. The carbon yield rises with the increase of discharge time, whether discharge in methanol or ethanol. However, carbon particles produced from ethanol are more than methanol with the same discharge time. The mean rate of carbon particles produced from ethanol can reach about 0.1872 g/h with the discharge time of 30 min, while the mean rate was only about 0.0866 g/h as carbon generated from methanol with the same discharge time. With the same alcohol volume of 300 mL, the number of carbon atoms in ethanol is more than 2.9 mol compared with methanol that maybe leads to the increase of carbon yield. Thus, further improvement of carbon yield can be expected in high-carbon alcohols."
6,Analysis of carbon nanoparticles produced by PSDL,"3.4 Analysis of carbon nanoparticles produced by PSDL As shown above, nano carbon nanoparticles can be efficiently produced from alcohols by PSDL. However, as Fig. 8 shows, other productions such as H2, CO, can be also found in gas production after discharge. Meanwhile, liquid methanol can be detected in ethanol after discharge. Water should be generated after discharge because the concentration of alcohols decreased. The main reactions of carbon production can be speculated as below: (3) 2 CH 3 OH → C + CO + H 2 O + 3 H 2 (4) C 2 H 5 OH → C + CO + 3 H 2 (5) C 2 H 5 OH → CH 3 OH + C + H 2 (6) C 2 H 5 OH → H 2 O + 2 C + 2 H 2 equation (3) shows carbon produced from methanol that C, CO, H2O, H2 can be found in the production. equations (4)–(6) present carbon particles generated from ethanol. The main productions like C, CO, H2O, H2 can be discovered in these equations, and CH3OH is also produced in equation (4). The produced CH3OH can be further used for carbon production like equation (2). It may be another reason that the yield of carbon particles produced from ethanol was more than from methanol. The similar conclusions can be found in some other work [27–29]. For example, Rincon et al. [27] researched ethanol-chemistry decomposition routes in a microwave plasma torch. Two routes were found, one produces CO, H2O, H2 and the other generates C, CO, H2. In addition, methanol was also found in ethanol decomposition by discharge plasma shown in Nishioka's work [29]."
7,Conclusions,"In summary, this work presents a PSDL method for carbon nanoparticles production from alcohols. By SEM and TEM analysis, spherical carbon particles with about 10 nm diameter can be produced by PSDL and the morphology was similar to the commercial carbon particles, which can be used in the production of rubber, battery, lubricant and so on. With the increase of discharge power, the mean diameter of carbon particles was largely decreased from micron size to nanoscale. Meanwhile, the size distribution of the produced particles was also more uniform with high discharge power. With the same discharge time, the yield of carbon produced from ethanol was more than from methanol. It indicated that further improvement of carbon yield can be expected in high-carbon alcohols. At last, the feasible pathway of carbon production from alcohols by PSDL was deduced that aims to guide the further investigations."
