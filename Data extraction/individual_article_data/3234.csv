0,Introduction,"Alginate, is an anionic polysaccharide derived from brown seaweed [1,2]. Due to its excellent biocompatibility, low toxicity, non-immunogenicity, relatively low cost and easy processability, it is one of the most attractive polysaccharides in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering [3]. Alginate is used in different formulations including foams [4], porous scaffolds [5], hydrogels [6], fibers [7] and bioinks [8], and has been extensively used for various applications such as wound healing [9], drug delivery [10–12] and tissue engineering of skin [13], bone [14,15], cartilage [16], heart [17], nerve [18] and liver [19]. Electrospinning, as a versatile method for polymeric nanofiber fabrication, is able to produce continuous fibers from submicron down to nanometer diameter [20,21]. Nanofibrous matrices with their large surface area, high porosity and their ability to interact with cells in a manner that mimics the natural ECM, are attractive structures in regenerative medicine [22]. Alginate nanofibers are appropriate candidates as bioactive wound dressings in order to control the moisture of wound surface and inhibit bacterial infiltration [23–27]. Moreover, nanofibrous alginate is suitable as a tissue engineering scaffold for cell encapsulation as well as drug delivery carriers with enhanced transport properties [28–34]. Despite all these applications, obtaining continuous and uniform nanofibers by electrospinning of pure alginate solution is still challenging [35]. Carrier polymers such as polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) [36–40], co-solvents and surfactants such as pluronic F-127 [41] or triton X-100 [42] have been used to facilitate the electrospinnability of alginate. In some cases, it has been shown that the carrier polymer can be completely removed from the electrospun mat via extensive washing in hot EtOH, because of the lower melting point of PEO and its solubility at that temperature [43,44]. However, the low content of alginate and existence of impurities, as well as difficulties in mass production of alginate-based nanofibers are still unsolved [35]. Some studies have stated that the electrical conductivity and high surface tension of alginate solution are the challenging issues [45]. However, addition of surfactants alone, does not improve alginate electrospinnability [46]. It is believed that the high density of inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonding between alginate chains are the main reasons hindering alginate electrospinnability [35,47–50]. Extensive hydrogen bonding, results in lack of required chain entanglement and the rigid structure of alginate in an aqueous solution, which leads to the formation of beads rather than fibers during electrospinning. Both inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonding exist between carboxylate and hydroxyl groups in alginate chains which restrict alginate electrospinnability. However, to date there is no report on showing which of them prevails and how solving this issue can improve alginate electrospinnability. In this regard, our group previously introduced a chemical modification on alginate structure, by sulfation of hydroxyl groups on alginate backbone [51]. Herein, we aim to fabricate nanofibers with increased alginate content by decreasing the density of inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonding between alginate chains, by introducing a simple physical modification of alginate with no changes on its chemical structure. The rationale of this work is based on a well-known theory introduced by Pearson in 1963 called “Hard and Soft Acids and Bases” (HSAB) [52]. This theory states that hard acids, which are acids with high charge and small size, preferentially associate with hard bases; while soft acids, which are acids with low charge and large size, prefer soft bases [52]. HSAB theory allows qualitative predictions about the outcome of chemical reactions and the relative stability of the products, based on ion-ligand coordinative bonds [53–59]. It has been shown that relatively hard amine groups of chitosan form strong bonds and stable complexes with lithium (Li+) as a small cation, whereas the interaction between amine groups and large cations like silver (Ag+) is so weak [58]. Based on the HSAB theory, the carboxylate group of alginate backbone is a hard base and preferably binds to hard acids. The hypothesis of this research states that the stronger interaction of carboxylate group with its counter-cation will result in a lower distribution of carboxylate negative charge and as a result, lower tendency toward hydrogen bonding with neighboring hydroxyl groups. Subsequently this weakening and reduction in hydrogen bonding density will liberate alginate chains to have the required chain entanglement for electrospinning (Scheme 1 ). To have a hard base as the carboxylate counter-cation, we opted for Li+, that due to its smaller size is a harder acid in comparison to Na+, the usual counter cation in alginate aqueous solution. To verify the accuracy of this hypothesis and investigate its effect on alginate electrospinnability, lithium (Li+), sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) salts of alginate were prepared and their blends with PVA were electrospun. Moreover, computational analysis was used to further investigate the interactions of different counter-cations with carboxylate hard anion based on the HSAB theory."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Sodium alginate (SA) with a medium molecular weight of 120,000–200,000 g.mol−1 and the M/G ratio of 0.8, and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with a medium molecular weight of 89,000–98,000 g.mol−1 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Lithium hydroxide (LiOH), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and ethanol (EtOH) were obtained from Merck."
3,Synthesis of alginate salts with different counter-cations,"2.2 Synthesis of alginate salts with different counter-cations Sodium alginate (4 g) was added to a mixture of HCl (0.6 N, 50 mL) and EtOH (40 mL) and stirred overnight at 4 °C. The solid fracture, alginic acid, was separated via filtration under vacuum using a coarse filter paper. The alginic acid was purified through washing with EtOH and acetone, and dried in the oven at 60 °C. The dried alginic acid was dispersed in 50 mL of deionized water and neutralized (pH=7.0) by lithium-, potassium- and sodium- hydroxide for each separate synthesis under controlled delivery conditions to obtain the corresponding alginate salt. The resulting solutions were dialyzed using a dialysis tube (MWCO, 3500) against deionized water for two days and then lyophilized to obtain purified powders of lithium alginate (Li-Alg), potassium alginate (K-Alg) and sodium alginate (Na-Alg)."
4,Electrospinning,"2.3 Electrospinning Aqueous solutions of alginate salts (2 wt%) and PVA (10 wt%) were prepared separately after stirring for 2 h. Each alginate salt solution was mixed with PVA solution with different volume ratios. The PVA and alginate solutions were prepared at 60 °C and room temperature, respectively. The Alg/PVA electrospinning solutions were also prepared at room temperature. Electrospinning was carried out using a 5-mL syringe with a 19-gauge needle which was filled with the solution at room temperature and chamber humidity of 25%. The flow rate of 0.2 mL.h−1, the applied voltage of 20 kV and the tip-to-collector distance of 15 cm were used for electrospinning."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The IR spectra of Li-Alg, K-Alg and Na-Alg from 4000 to 400 cm−1 was collected with a Bruker-Equinox55 FTIR spectrometer (Ettlingen, Germany) using dried powder of alginate salts with 32 scans at the 8 cm−1 resolution. In order to detect the substitution of counter-cations in alginate salts, Bruker DRX-500 Avance spectrometer (Germany) was used. The 1H NMR spectra of all three salts of alginate were recorded in D2O as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the standard. The conductivity of aqueous solutions of alginate salts was measured by WPA CMD 510 conductivity meter (Ireland), and their viscosity was measured by a Brookfield viscometer (DV-II+ Pro, Brookfield, USA). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Model Vega, Tescan Co., Czech Republic) was used to study the morphology of electrospun scaffolds. ImageJ software was used for measuring the fiber diameters."
6,Computational analysis,"2.5 Computational analysis The program ORCA was used for all density functional theory (DFT) calculations [60]. Geometries were optimized using the BP86 density functional [61,62] with the def2-TZVP basis sets [63] and single point energies were computed using the PW6B95 functionals [64] for which the percentage of exact Hartree-Fock exchange is 28%."
7,Results and discussion,"A Literature survey on alginate electrospinning in aqueous medium shows that it is challenging due to the high density of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonding, and also high viscosity of alginate solution and its polyelectrolyte nature. It is well-accepted that both intramolecular hydrogen bonding between carboxylate and hydroxyl groups, and intermolecular hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl groups of uronic acid residues of alginate chains restrict its flexibility and electrospinnability in an aqueous solution. To find the influence of each mechanism, we substituted the sodium counter-cation with lithium and potassium and probed its effect on hydrogen bonding density as well as alginate electrospinnability. Alginate molecular weight and its M/G ratio were constant and not considered as a variable in this study, therefore, the difference in physiochemical properties as well as electrospinnability of alginate solutions were only controlled via different counter-cations. We tested the effect of counter-cation substitution on viscosity and electrical conductivity of alginate salts in aqueous solutions (1 wt%). As shown in Table 1 , the values of electrical conductivity decrease as Li-Alg < Na-Alg < K-Alg. The lower electrical conductivity of Li-Alg solution shows the lower free carboxylate groups in the solution to carry the electrical charge. This can be easily described by the higher charge density, i.e. harder nature, and stronger interaction between Li+ and carboxylate pairs compared to the Na+ and K+ counter-cations. This stronger affinity provides the interaction between the Li+ and COO− pairs to be more covalent, while the ions of K+ and COO− form a stronger ionic complex. Since an ionic complex is dissolved easier than a covalent complex, the K-Alg and Li-Alg demonstrated highest and lowest electrical conductivity values, respectively. Regarding the solution viscosity, the viscosity of alginate salts increases as Li-Alg > Na-Alg > K-Alg. This can be explained by the direct relation between intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonding and viscosity. In other words, the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between carboxylate anion and hydroxyl groups in Li-Alg salt is weaker than other salts. This is due to the more covalent nature of Li–COO− pairs and the lower free negative charge on the carboxylate anion which results in lower tendency of carboxylate groups to bind the neighboring hydrogen atoms. This decrease in intramolecular hydrogen bonding is compensated by an increase in intermolecular hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl functional groups of uronic acid moieties. On other hand, the hydrogen bond distance between two neighbor uronic acid residues in Li-Alg is higher than that in K-Alg (Scheme 1), therefore, it is probable that Li-Alg can topologically interact stronger with respect to the K-Alg ones and possess higher number of entanglements. Furthermore, as shown in Table 1, the electrostatic repulsions between Li-Alg chains must be lower than those in K-Alg. Both of these phenomena can describe the higher values of viscosity in Li-Alg salt compared to other alginate salts. Considering the trends in physiochemical properties of alginate slats, it can be concluded that the intermolecular hydrogen bonding in alginate solution plays more important role in solution viscosity compared to the intramolecular hydrogen bonding. To confirm the supposed interactions between alginate and its counter-cations in molecular-scale, the FTIR spectroscopy was used. The FTIR spectra of all alginate salts showed similar features, but with some bands shifted from their original positions. As shown in Fig. 1 , the asymmetrical band of carboxylate anion has slightly shifted to higher wavenumbers from 1616 cm−1 in Na-Alg to 1620 cm−1 in Li-Alg, revealing the lower free negative charge of carboxylate groups and following resonance structures due to the covalent feature of Li+ and COO− ions. This observation confirms the hypothesis that counter-cation exchange of Na+ with Li+ results in stronger interaction with carboxylate ion and decreases its ability to involve in hydrogen bonding interactions. Moreover, for K-Alg salt, this number has shifted to 1608 cm−1 indicating increased hydrogen bonding interactions and also confirming the hypothesis. To further confirm our hypothesis, we used the 1H NMR spectroscopy to show the probable role of different counter-cations on intramolecular hydrogen bonding of alginate salts (Fig. 2 ). Mackie has proposed a plausible intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the carboxylate group of a guluronate ring and C-2 hydroxyl group of the neighbor guluronate, as shown in Scheme 2 [58]. It is obvious that the hydrogen bonding strength between these functional groups can influence the chemical shift of the C-2 proton on the neighbor guluronate monomer. Since the Li+ cation has a stronger interaction with carboxylate anion and decreases the hydrogen bonding strength, we anticipate that the C-2 proton will appear at higher values of chemical shift in Li-Alg salt. Interestingly, we observed the C-2 proton of guluronate monomer of Li-Alg at 3.82 ppm, higher than that for Na-Alg and K-Alg. Beside the chemical analyses, we used computational data to further confirm the interactions of different counter-cations with carboxylate hard anion based on the HSAB theory. To investigate the strength of the hydrogen bonding and the interactions between metal cations and carboxylate anion, a dimer structure was chosen with two cations of Li+, Na+ or K+. The metal-oxygen and hydrogen‑oxygen bond distances and the corresponding Mayer bond orders [65] are presented in Table 2 , and the optimized structures are shown in Fig. 3 . Interestingly, the computational data confirmed that the bond lengths of lithium-carboxylate pair (1.88 Å) and hydrogen-carboxylate intermolecular hydrogen bonding (1.84 Å) are dramatically lower and higher than other metal-carboxylate pairs, respectively. In the other words, the higher lithium-carboxylate bond order reveals the tighter interaction between hard-hard pairs based on HSAB theory. This means, the carboxylate anion tends to be preferably bonded to its counter-cation than to be included in intermolecular hydrogen bonding. After confirming our hypothesis, we tried to investigate its effect on electrospinning of alginate. We anticipated that Li-Alg salt with a hard-hard ion pairs, and a lower intramolecular hydrogen bonding should demonstrate better electrospinnability than other salts. The SEM images of electrospun nanofibers from different alginate salts are shown in Fig. 4 . It is important noting that we use no surfactants in this study, and alginate (2%) and PVA (10%) solutions were prepared and electrospun as 10:90, 20:80, 30:70, 40:60 and 50:50 (v/v %) ratios. The electrospinning parameters including flow rate, tip to collector distance and voltage were held constant for all cases. We just changed alginate salt type and alginate content in electrospinning solution. When the alginate content was 10% (v/v) in the solution, all three salts were readily electrospun (Fig. 4a-c), but increasing alginate content up to 20% and 30% resulted in some bead formation, and the number and size of beads were more for Na-Alg and K-Alg salts compared to the Li-Alg (Fig. 4d-i). Interestingly, the solutions with alginate content of 40% v/v were still electrospinnable for Li-Alg but resulted in substantial bead formation and hindered continuous electrospinning process for Na-Alg and K-Alg salts (Fig. 4j-l). For alginate solutions with higher concentration, i.e. 50% v/v, it was impossible to get electrospun nanofibers for Na-Alg and K-Alg solutions and we got drops, but for Li-Alg sample, even though it resulted in beaded fibers, we could still get continuous fibers and electrospun mats (Fig. 4m). In an attempt to increase Li-Alg content in electrospinning solution, we mixed 3% Li-Alg and 8% PVA with 30:70 and 40:60 (V/V%) ratios. As shown in Fig. 5 , there were many beads in resulting mats for both ratios, but it was still possible to get continuous fibers which is an improvement in electrospinning of alginate without using surfactant. In all ratios, there is a trend in the quality of fibers in terms of having less beads between three salts of alginate in a way that Li-Alg salt is more amenable to be electrospun. These results suggest that substituting counter-cation in sodium alginate salt with Li+ cation improves its electrospinnability and thus confirms our hypothesis. For a long time, researchers have supposed that the challenge of alginate electrospinnability is due to its solution high viscosity. However, we showed the opposite by the Li-Alg aqueous solution having the highest viscosity among alginate salts and as shown having better electrospinnability. Moreover, considering the physiochemical data, it can be noted that the electrospinnability of alginate salts is also affected by the electrical conductivity of the solution and not only the solution viscosity. Besides the important effect of conductivity, viscosity and entanglements are as well fundamental in the electrospinning process of alginate salts. Based on both computational data and viscosity analysis, reduced charge density of Li-Alg chains provides the macromolecules with a greater capability to form topological constraints, which in turn improve the system processability. The average diameter of nanofibers is reported in Table 3 . As expected, nanofiber diameter decreases by increasing the alginate content in the solution [66]. Moreover, for solutions with low alginate contents (<20%), there is no significant difference between nanofiber diameter of Li-Alg/PVA, K-Alg/PVA and Na-Alg/PVA. Although, in higher alginate contents, the average nanofiber diameter of Li-Alg is higher than K-Alg and Na-Alg. This can be assigned to the lower electrical conductivity of Li-Alg which decreases the stretching of the solution and as a result, the formation of thicker fibers [67]. Moreover, the results have indicated that the effect of conductivity on the nanofiber diameter is more dominant than solution viscosity [66]. In addition, based on mentioned results, another advantage of alginate counter-cation substitution is the possibility of altering alginate nanofibers diameter without changing electrospinning process parameters."
8,Conclusion,"Alginate nanofibers have numerous applications in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. Nonetheless, facile fabrication of alginate nanofibers via electrospinning is still challenging and increasing alginate content in electrospinning solution results in bead formation and hinders continuous electrospinning. Herein, we applied a simple method to study the effect of hydrogen bonding interactions and its effect on alginate electrospinnability. We applied HSAB theory and found that substitution of Li+ counter-cation as a hard acid, instead of Na+, results in a stronger interaction with hard base of carboxylate anion in alginate backbone, and weakens intramolecular hydrogen bonding, and subsequently improves alginate electrospinnability. This study introduces a simple technique to increase alginate content in continuous bead-free electrospun nanofibers without any alteration in alginate chemical structure or addition of any impurities. Further experiments are anticipated to show the effect of counter-cation substitution on nanofibrous mat mechanical and biological performance."
