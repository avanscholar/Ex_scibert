0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) production processes are currently being investigated because H2 is recognized as a clean fuel and energy carrier in fuel cells. The fuel cell technology is a promising alternative to traditional power generation systems for sustainable and efficient energy conversion. Among different types of fuel cells, the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is gaining increasing attention because of the wide potential range of applications. One of the mayor advantages is their fuel flexibility due to the high operation temperature. SOFC can utilize a wide range of fuels by internal or external reforming for power generation [1]. It should be noted the tolerance of SOFC to carbon monoxide CO. While for other type of fuel cells, such as proton exchange membrane (PEM), CO acts as a poison, in SOFC it is a fuel. The SOFC offers the highest system efficiency of up to 60% by internal reforming of the fuel and gas recirculation [2], or over 80% combining heat and power generation [3] by using the waste heat. Currently, the main process for H2 production is steam reforming of fossil fuels, such as natural gas, naphtha, and coal. However, renewable sources like biomass have attracted much attention looking for CO2 neutral energy balances. H2 can be obtained from biomass by thermochemical processes, such as gasification to syngas or steam reforming of the bio-oil derived from a fast pyrolysis of the biomass. The conversion of bio-oil is one of the most promising routes, due to its higher energy yield compared to gasification [4] and the higher energy density of bio-oil than biomass. Bio-oil is a complex mixture of oxygenate compounds depending on biomass nature and pyrolysis conditions. One of the major components of bio-oil is acetic acid (AcOH) with up to 13 wt% [5], which is non-inflammable unlike methanol and ethanol. Hence, the widely available AcOH is a safe H2 carrier, which can easily be stored, handled, and transported. Steam reforming (SR) of AcOH as a model component of bio-oil for H2 production has been investigated over different catalytic systems. It was shown that AcOH can be completely converted at a temperature of 700 °C with high H2 selectivity [6–8]. Hence, AcOH can be used for internal reforming in SOFCs producing a H2 rich gas mixture. The high operation temperature of 700–1000 °C [9] allows the direct conversion of the fuel into a H2 and CO rich fuel in the electrochemical cell. Therefore, any external heat source for the endothermic SR as well as for fuel evaporation is not necessary. This enables a simple and efficient system design with reduced size and low costs [10]. Thermodynamic analyses of hydrocarbons, such as methane (CH4), and of alcohols, such as ethanol or methanol, under SR conditions are widely investigated to identify operation conditions at which a H2 rich fuel gas can be obtained [11–14]. However, literature dealing with the thermodynamic analysis of AcOH, or of the aqueous phase of bio-oil is scarce. Vagia et al. [15] studied the thermodynamics of AcOH SR at a temperature range between 130 °C and 1030 °C, steam to fuel ratio between 1 and 9 and at atmospheric pressure. They showed that SR of AcOH is thermodynamically feasible. AcOH can be fully converted at all operating conditions examined. As temperature is increased H2 production grows till it reaches a maximum at 630 °C. The higher the steam to fuel ratio, the higher the H2 yield is. The authors also ensure a carbon free operation at temperatures higher than 330 °C and steam to fuel ratios higher than 3. The present thermodynamic analysis is aimed to examine optimal operation conditions for SOFC applications with internal reforming of AcOH. Therefore, the study focuses on high temperatures of up to 1200 °C. In order to achieve high fuel cell performance the water (H2O) content in the fuel has to be minimized to avoid energy losses by evaporating the fuel and to optimize the system size [10]. Hence, the thermodynamic analysis for highly concentrated AcOH solutions of approximately 60 vol% was of especial interest in this study. In contrast to other studies, in this work the production of carbon monoxide (CO) is preferred over the generation of carbon dioxide (CO2), since CO can be used as fuel in SOFCs, which provides more electricity output. The focus is put on the influence of process parameters, such as temperature, feed composition, and pressure on the equilibrium product distribution of AcOH SR. Thermodynamically favorable operating conditions in terms of high H2 yield, high CO/CO2 ratio, high AcOH conversion, and minimal solid carbon deposition were determined."
1,Thermodynamic analysis,
2,Simulation methodology,"2.1 Simulation methodology Generally, chemical equilibrium compositions are calculated based on the equilibrium constants of the reactions. However, for SR of AcOH this procedure is not useful, because a high number of simultaneous and consecutive reactions take place and the calculation becomes extremely complex. Therefore, the thermodynamic equilibrium of SR of AcOH was analyzed by the minimization of the Gibbs free energy using Aspen Plus software. This method helps to establish process models without tedious calculations for obtaining the equilibrium product distribution of a system. The simulation model was built using an equilibrium based reactor, which consists of Gibbs free energy (ΔG) minimization of the system subject to atom balance constraints (RGIBBS). This type of reactor is useful when reactions are not known or are high in number due to many components participating in the reactions. This model does not require reaction stoichiometry. RGIBBS can also determine phase equilibria, particularly for multiple liquid phases, only by the specification of the components present in the system and the type of streams (mole flow, mole fraction, mass flow, mass fraction, etc.) if adequate mixture thermodynamic models are selected. Temperature and pressure (or pressure and enthalpy) of the reactor and the steam to fuel ratio must also be specified. In this analysis the formation of the following compounds was considered: H2, CO, CO2, CH4, carbon, acetaldehyde, ethane, ethylene, and acetylene as products of SR of AcOH; and the possible unreacted reagents, H2O and AcOH. All of them were found in vapor phase, except of carbon which was specified as a solid (in graphite form). For a given isothermal and isobaric system, Gibbs free energy minimization method can be presented theoretically as follows [16]. The total free energy of the system is expressed in Eq. (1) (1) G = ∑ i = 1 NC ∑ j = 1 NP n i j μ i j where nij is the number of moles of component i in j phase; μij is the chemical potential of component i in j phase, which is function of j phase composition, temperature and pressure; NP represents the number of phases; and NC the number of components. The same Eq. (1) can be rewritten in terms of fugacity, f (Eqs. (2) and (3)): (2) G = ∑ i = 1 NC ∑ j = 1 NP ( μ i 0 + R T ln f ˆ i f i 0 ) (3) G = ∑ i = 1 NC ∑ j = 1 NP n i j ( μ i 0 + R T ln f ˆ i j f i 0 ) where μ i 0 is the chemical potential of pure component i at a standard state; f i 0 is the fugacity of the pure component i at a standard state; R represents the gas universal constant; and T is the temperature of the equilibrium. The system was considered as a solid–gas system, and for the gaseous phase, the standard state used was pure components as ideal gases at 1.013 bar (1 atm), therefore fugacity can be expressed as Eq. (4): (4) f ˆ i g = ϕ ˆ i y i P where yi is the molar fraction of component i in the gaseous phase; Фi is the fugacity coefficient of component i in the gaseous phase; and P represents the total pressure. For the solid phase the reference state was this phase at 25 °C and 1.013 bar (1 atm), because pure solid compounds were considered (carbon-graphite in this case), so Eq. (5) is fulfilled: (5) f ˆ i S = f i S , 0 where f i s, 0 is the fugacity of the pure component i in the solid phase and at a standard state. At low pressures and high temperatures, the hypothesis of ideal gas (Фi = 1) can be assumed, the absence of liquid phase and rejection of the molar fraction of the pure solid compound in gas phase was admitted. So Eqs. (4) and (5) could be simplified, and substituted in Eq. (3), resulting in Eq. (6): (6) G = ∑ i − 1 NC n i g ( μ i g , 0 + R T ( ln P + ln y i ) ) + ∑ i = 1 NC n i S μ i S , 0 In the Gibbs free energy minimization method some restrictions should be considered: a) Non-negativity of moles number (Eq. (7)): (7) n i j ≥ 0 , i = 1 , … , NC ; j = 1 , … , NP b) Mass conservation: the mass balance of each atomic species must be fulfilled according to the stoichiometry of the reactions involved (Eqs. (8) and (9)). (8) ∑ j = 1 NP n i j = n i , i = 1 , … , NC (9) ∑ j = 1 NP a m i n i = ∑ j = 1 NC a m i n i 0 , m = 1 , … , NE Where ni is the total number of moles of component i; ami is the number of atoms of element m in component i; and NE represents the number of elements of m in the system. Non-reactive species (inert) were considered as components with a constant number of moles. The chemical potential of a pure component i at the standard state, μ i 0 , can be calculated using the following thermodynamic relations (Eqs. (10) and (11)): (10) ∂ ∂ T ( G ¯ i R T ) p = − H ¯ i R T 2 (11) ( ∂ H ¯ i ∂ T ) p = CP i where Gi is the partial molar Gibbs free energy; Hi is the partial molar enthalpy; and Cpi represents the heat capacity at constant pressure of component i. In the optimization process the moles in the gaseous ( n i g ) and solid ( n i s ) phases were considered as decision variables, while pressure, temperature, and the chemical potential of the pure component at the standard state were the specified parameters. Despite the formulated problem was nonlinear, the methodology guaranteed the global optimum, because the problem was convex. Aspen Plus uses property methods to compute thermodynamic (fugacity coefficient, enthalpy, entropy, Gibbs free energy, and total volume) and transport properties (viscosity, thermal conductivity, diffusion coefficient, and surface tension). There are two thermodynamic methods for determining all the properties: Equation-of-State Property Method and Activity Coefficient Property Method. The difference between both is that the first method uses state equations, while with the second method only the properties of the vapor phase are calculated by state equations, and the properties in liquid phase are obtained by adding the properties of each pure components and a term representing mixture. For the thermodynamic analysis of AcOH SR reaction the property method used was Redlich–Kwong–Soave (SRK), which is an Equation-of-State Property Method. It can provide suitable solutions for gas mixtures, where polarity of compounds is not strong [17]. It should be taken into account that chemical reactions do not always reach the equilibrium because they are not kinetically feasible under certain conditions. So this study should be considered as an indicative approach demonstrating which products can be formed and where the chemical limits can be found."
3,The chemical reaction system,"2.2 The chemical reaction system An analysis of the chemical reactions occurring during SR of AcOH was described elsewhere [6,18–20]. Together with the SR reaction, other reactions such as water-gas shift (WGS) reaction, thermal decomposition (TD) reactions, ketonizations, Boudouard reaction, etc. may also take place. A number of possible reactions involved in SR of AcOH is given in Table 1 , with the reaction enthalpy (ΔH in kJ/mol) and the variation in mole number (Δn). SR of AcOH with a molar ratio of 2 to 1 can be described by the overall reaction Eq. (12). WGS reaction (Eq. (13)) plays an important role in SR system. The equilibrium of this moderately exothermic reaction shows a significant dependence on the temperature. At low temperatures CO2 and H2 are formed, while at around 700 °C the equilibrium is shifted towards the reverse reaction (RWGS), producing CO and H2O [21]. At low temperatures exothermic TD forming CH4 and CO2 (decarboxylation, Eq. (19)) constitutes an important part of the reaction system [15]. Otherwise, at high temperatures AcOH can be thermally decomposed to H2 and CO according to Eq. (17). However, in the presence of water this reaction is not expected because AcOH SR is less endothermic and therefore favored because it requires less energy. Hydrogenation of CO or CO2 (Eqs. (14) and (15)), or the reverse exothermic reactions, the CH4 SR to syngas or to CO2 and H2, have to be considered. On one hand, the SR step, where CH4 reacts with H2O to produce CO and H2, is an endothermic process. Thus, desirable conversions are obtained at approximately 850 °C with H2O/CH4 feed ratios in the range of 3–4 [22]. On the other hand, methanation reactions are favored at low temperatures and high pressures (20–30 bar). High selectivity to CH4 can also be achieved working at atmospheric pressure provided that the temperature is low. CO is much easier to hydrogenate than CO2. However, active catalysts are needed in order to overcome kinetic barriers, especially at low temperature [20]. The irreversible decomposition of AcOH to coke precursors such as ethylene or other olefins must also be taken into account (Eq. (18)), as well as ketonization reactions, especially the formation of acetone (Eq. (20)) and ketene, which decomposes forming C2H4 and C3H4 (Eq. (21)). Reactions that directly form coke were also considered, and Boudouard reaction is the best known one (Eq. (25)). It is a reversible reaction. At low temperatures the equilibrium shifts to CO2, and carbon formation is thermodynamically possible. But at high temperatures, above 800 °C, CO is favored and carbon will not be formed [19]."
4,Operating conditions of the simulation,"2.3 Operating conditions of the simulation The purpose of this work is to study the equilibrium of SR of AcOH system in a wide range of temperature, steam to AcOH (H2O/AcOH) ratio, and pressure. Therefore, the parameters chosen for the simulation range from 100 °C to 1200 °C, molar ratios of 0/1 to 10/1, and 1–20 bar, respectively. However, since the idea is to use a SOFC with internal reformer, the values of the variables that are close to the operation conditions of the SOFC are of special interest. The SOFC needs high temperatures for its operation, between 700 °C and 1000 °C; low H2O content is desired, since the entire system is more energetically efficient; and it is working at atmospheric pressure. The primary goal for SR of AcOH is to obtain a H2 and CO rich stream, because these species are going to be oxidized in the SOFC to generate electricity. Therefore, the aim is to reach both high H2 yields and high CO/CO2 ratios. CH4 and other co-products like acetaldehyde, ethane, ethylene, and acetylene are not considered as desirable products since they contain hydrogen, decreasing thus the overall H2 yield."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Equilibrium product distribution,"3.1 Equilibrium product distribution Different sensitivity analyses have been carried out in order to calculate the equilibrium product distribution by varying temperature, H2O/AcOH feed ratio, and pressure. Each simulation is based on the conversion of one mole of AcOH and in all cases AcOH was fully converted. As products of the SR process, only H2, CH4, CO, CO2, H2O and carbon have been presented in the following figures. Other products such as acetaldehyde, ethane, ethylene, acetylene or oxygenated products have been also taken into account during calculation, but their concentrations at equilibrium composition were negligible (less than 0.005%). The theoretical results of this thermodynamic study do not show a significant production of carbon but it is well known that it is actually formed in catalytic AcOH SR [5,7,23–25]. In fact, equilibrium calculations ignore reaction kinetics, catalytic performance, and transport processes; further refinement of optimal operating conditions requires kinetic studies. The results of this thermodynamic analysis are useful to be compared with future and more detailed experimental results. In this study, the general product distribution as a function of the variable under study is presented first, and then the production of H2 and CO as function of this parameter is given, in order to consider the effect of each parameter on the equilibrium distribution. 3.1.1 Effect of temperature In order to consider AcOH as a fuel in SOFC, thermodynamic analysis of AcOH SR have been carried out on a wide temperature range, but focusing especially on the high operation temperatures of the SOFC. The influence of the temperature on the equilibrium product distribution is presented in Fig. 1 for a fixed H2O/AcOH ratio of 2/1 and a constant pressure of 1 bar. At low temperatures, the exothermic TD of AcOH to CH4 and CO2 (Eq. (19)) is thermodynamically favored. Consequently, AcOH is decomposed to an equimolar mixture of CH4 and CO2, and H2O remains unreacted in the system. With increasing temperature, starting from 200 °C, H2 formation starts by SR of AcOH. Within a temperature range between 200 °C and 500 °C, AcOH is decomposed by both SR (Eq. (12)) and TD (Eq. (19)) reactions, implying a lower concentration of CH4 at the equilibrium and an increase in CO2 concentration, since it is formed by both reactions. However, at the low temperature range, below 500 °C, TD of AcOH remains the thermodynamically favored reaction, and with increasing temperature, SR becomes dominant. CO production is mainly controlled by the exothermic WGSR (Eq. (13)). At low temperatures CO reacts with H2O forming CO2 and H2, while at high temperatures the RWGS reaction is favored, consuming CO2 and H2 in order to form CO and H2O. In fact, it can be observed that CO is not predicted at temperatures lower than 400 °C. At this temperature the WGS equilibrium is shifted to CO production, and it steadily increases with rising temperature, till, at certain temperature, it overcomes the CO2 production. Therefore, at temperatures above 500–600 °C AcOH is mainly decomposed by SR reaction and some of the formed H2 and CO2 are consumed by the reverse RWGS reaction. Around 700 °C the exothermic TD is totally inhibited. At this temperature, for a fixed H2O/AcOH molar ratio of 2/1, the maximum production of H2 is reached. By increasing the temperature more H2 is consumed via RWGS reaction than it is produced via SR reaction. Thus, H2 concentration at the equilibrium decreases. Consequently, at the high temperature range, together with H2, CO and H2O are the predominant products. Fig. 2 shows the product equilibrium distribution at different temperatures for a H2O/AcOH ratio 1 to 1. This case is interesting to include because the products do not follow the general tendency that has been already described. In this case since there is not enough H2O in the system for SR reaction given by Eq. (12), the following overall reaction (Eq. (26)) should be considered instead: (26) C H 3 C O O H + H 2 O ⇔ 3 H 2 + C O 2 + C O Δ H = 172,6 kJ/mol In comparison with SR according to Eq. (12) the involvement of Eq. (26) leads to a lower production of H2 and CO2, and higher of CO. Moreover, less H2O remains in the system, which implies that WGS equilibrium shifts at higher temperatures (500 °C). In fact this equilibrium is favored to CO and H2O formation with lower concentration of H2O according to Le Chatelier's principle. In Fig. 3 the influence of temperature on the product distribution is shown when no H2O is added to the system. It can be deduced that with pure AcOH, only TD reactions happen. At low temperatures AcOH is converted by exothermic TD reaction to CH4 and CO2 (Eq. (19)), while at high temperatures the TD is due to Eq. (17), which leads to the formation of CO and H2. In this case when no H2O is fed to the system, WGS reaction almost does not affect the equilibrium product distribution of the AcOH SR system. The WGS equilibrium is just slightly shifted towards CO and H2O formation around 800 °C by the reaction of the H2 and the small amount of CO2 formed from TD reactions. Then, a trace amount of H2O can be also found at the equilibrium at high temperatures, although it cannot be seen in Fig. 3. 3.1.2 Effect of steam to acetic acid molar ratio Energy considerations of the use of AcOH as a fuel in the SOFC are not only performed with regard to temperature, but also regarding the H2O/AcOH ratio fed to the system. Fig. 4 represents the product distribution in the equilibrium as function of H2O/AcOH molar ratio. The trend is shown at constant temperature, exemplified for 500 °C and 1 bar. As expected, H2 equilibrium production increases with the H2O/AcOH ratio because the SR reaction is more favored. Then, SR is more involved in AcOH conversion, disfavoring TD. CH4 production, therefore, decreases as the H2O/AcOH ratio increases. With regard to the WGS equilibrium, it is slightly affected by changes in H2O/AcOH ratio. The higher the H2O/AcOH ratio, the more favored WGS reaction is. But the involvement of WGS reaction in the equilibrium is more pronounced at high temperatures, when the reverse reaction is favored. The temperature when the equilibrium shifts is slightly higher at higher H2O/AcOH ratios (i.e. from 400 °C with H2O/AcOH = 2/1 to 500 °C with H2O/AcOH = 4/1) since the higher H2O concentration disfavors RWGS reaction. Thus, CO production decreases with increasing the H2O/AcOH ratio as it is being consumed in WGS reaction. Consequently, CO2 production is increased with higher H2O/AcOH ratios, because both SR and WGS reactions are favored. Logically, more H2O remains in the system as the H2O/AcOH ratio increases. Fig. 5 represents the H2 production as function of H2O/AcOH molar ratio for different temperatures. In Fig. 5 it can be clearly observed that H2 production increases with the H2O/AcOH ratio whatever the temperature is. However, the slope depends on both temperature and H2O/AcOH ratio. The highest increment is observed at 600 °C. Fig. 5 intends to show that depending on the H2O/AcOH ratio the temperature at which the maximum production of H2 is reached changes. In general, for fixed H2O/AcOH ratios higher than 6/1, increasing the temperature above 600 °C reduces the H2 production via consumption of H2 by RWGS reaction, which is favored at high temperatures. On the other hand, for fixed H2O/AcOH ratios lower than 2/1, the reduction in H2 starts at higher temperatures (T = 800 °C). But in this last case the maximum H2 production is lower than at high molar ratios, because high temperatures and low H2O/AcOH ratios favored RWGS reaction and, therefore, consumption of H2. For ratios in between (2/1 < H2O/AcOH < 6/1) this maximum is reached at 700 °C. This means that operating at low temperature can lead to high H2 production if the H2O/AcOH ratio is very high. This is due to the fact that at low temperature the produced H2 is not consumed by exothermic WGS reaction. Moreover, Fig. 5 shows that the difference in H2O/AcOH ratio should be very high to notice significant changes in the temperature where H2 production reaches its maximum. This leads to the conclusion that the temperature has a stronger effect on H2 production than the H2O/AcOH ratio. Not only H2 yield but also the yield of CO in SR of AcOH depends on the molar ratio of H2O/AcOH. Changes in CO production due to a variation of the H2O/AcOH ratio can be seen in Fig. 6 . The trend is given for different temperatures. As expected, CO production increases with temperature, but decreases with the H2O/AcOH ratio. At low temperatures (T < 400 °C) the effect of H2O/AcOH ratio is not significant and CO production is constant as the H2O/AcOH ratio increases from 1/1 onwards. At higher temperatures CO production decreases as the H2O/AcOH ratio is higher because it is consumed in WGS reaction. 3.1.3 Effect of pressure The pressure in the reformer may also affect the product distribution of AcOH SR. Fig. 7 represents the variation of gas mixture equilibrium composition with pressure for H2O/AcOH ratio of 2/1. The product distribution is given exemplified for a constant temperature of 500 °C showing a clear tendency of the products. SR reactions (Eqs. (12) and (26)) are the most affected ones by pressure. These reactions imply the biggest increase in mole number (Δn = +3, see Table 1), being the most disfavored ones by an increase of pressure. TD reaction (Eq. (19)) also implies an increment in mole number (Δn = +1), but smaller than in the case of SR. Therefore, TD reaction is more involved in AcOH conversion at higher pressure due to the inhibition of SR. Then, as pressure increases the H2 production is decreased. Although CO2 is formed by both TD and SR reactions, its total production is smaller at higher pressures, because by TD reaction only 1 mol of CO2 is formed per mol of AcOH in contrast with 2 mol of CO2 by SR. Due to the lower concentration of CO2 and H2 at higher pressures, CO production decreases as well, since RWGS reaction is less favored. It must be noticed that at higher pressures the temperature when the WGS equilibrium shifts towards CO production is higher in comparison with the one corresponding to atmospheric pressure. The pressure increment involves an increase in CH4 production at the equilibrium, produced by more favored TD of AcOH. The most remarkable changes in product distribution due to pressure happen between 1 and 6 bar. The production of H2 and CO depends not only on reaction temperature and molar ratio of H2O/AcOH but also on pressure. Fig. 8 represents the effect of pressure in H2 production as function of temperature for a constant H2O/AcOH ratio of 4/1, while in Fig. 9 the effect of pressure on CO production is shown. As expected, increasing temperature the H2 production increases until a maximum is reached, and then it slightly decreases. If the pressure increases, H2 production decreases and its maximum shifts to higher temperatures. This effect of pressure can be explained due to the inhibition of SR reaction at high pressures. Consequently the TD reaction is more involved in AcOH conversion at higher pressures than at lower pressures. However, at temperatures higher than 900 °C SR is the main reaction, because the exothermic TD is completely inhibited for the fixed ratio of 4/1 exemplified in Fig. 8. At this high temperature the endothermic SR reaction is so favored that the production of H2 is independent of pressure. At lower temperatures than 200 °C only TD takes place, which does not form H2. As expected, CO production increases with temperature since it is formed via RWGS reaction. However, increasing the pressure CO production decreases due to the inhibition of SR reaction at higher pressures. In fact H2 and CO2 concentrations decrease disfavoring RWGS reaction and consequently CO production. Taking into account that at H2O/AcOH ratio of 4/1 CO is not formed until 400 °C is reached, pressure influences CO production between 400 °C and 900 °C range. Regarding the H2O/AcOH molar ratio, it was verified that its variation does not imply any significant difference in equilibrium production at different pressures. However it is interesting to explain the case when H2O/AcOH ratio is 1/1 because the overal SR reaction (Eq. (12)) does not happen, but Eq. (26). Both SR reactions imply the same variation in mole number, so the tendency of the products at the equilibrium is similar in both cases at low temperatures when pressure increases. The difference starts at high temperatures, such as 800 °C, when the pressure variation affects the equilibrium production unlike in the case of higher H2O/AcOH ratios. Fig. 10 shows the product equilibrium distribution at H2O/AcOH ratio of 1/1 exemplified for 800 °C as function of the pressure. In Fig. 10 it can clearly seen that with increasing pressure, SR to H2 and CO is depressed. The formation of CH4, H2O and CO2 increased. This is because with a H2O/AcOH ratio of 1/1, even though the temperature is high, at high pressures TD reaction (Eq. (19)) is not inhibited yet, meaning that AcOH is converted not only by SR (Eq. (26)) but also due to TD forming CH4 and CO2. Logically, the increase in H2O production is due to the H2O that remains unreacted and that is formed by RWGS reaction. Therefore, it can be concluded that, though the influence of pressure is not very strong, this parameter should be considered especially below 6 bars and when working at temperatures between 200 °C and 900 °C. 3.1.4 Analysis of CO/CO2 ratio Together with H2, CO is one of the desired products in the system, since it is also a fuel for SOFC. Thus, it is interesting to study the influence of the parameters on CO to CO2 ratio. Fig. 11 shows the variation of CO/CO2 molar ratio with temperature change for different H2O/AcOH ratios and 1 bar. While CO/CO2 ratio does not vary remarkably at low temperatures (T < 500 °C), at high temperatures an increase of CO/CO2 ratio can be observed, which is more rapid at lower H2O/AcOH ratios. From Fig. 11 it can be also extracted that to produce a gas mixture rich in CO (CO/CO2 > 1), the temperature should be higher than 650 °C working with H2O/AcOH = 2/1. CO and CO2 productions are highly affected by WGS equilibrium. In Fig. 11 it can be clearly seen that at low temperatures CO/CO2 ratio is independent of the H2O/AcOH ratio, unlike at high temperatures, implying that the influence of temperature on WGS equilibrium is bigger than the influence of H2O/AcOH feed ratio. CO to CO2 ratio is represented in Fig. 12 as function of H2O/AcOH ratio for two temperatures, 500 °C and 800 °C, at 1 bar. It can be noticed that for high temperatures (e.g. 800 °C) CO production overcomes CO2 production for H2O/AcOH <4/1. These are conditions under which RWGS reaction is very favored. However, at lower temperatures (e.g. 500 °C) CO2 production is higher than CO production for every H2O/AcOH ratio. In fact, around this temperature WGS equilibrium is slightly shifted towards CO2 production as the H2O/AcOH ratio increases, but it does not imply important conversions of CO to CO2."
7,Discussion,"3.2 Discussion Regarding the application of internal steam reforming of AcOH in SOFC, energy considerations should be taken into account in order to determine the optimal operating conditions inside the reformer. The H2O/AcOH ratio fed to the reactor is one of the most important operation parameters with regard to the system efficiency of a fuel cell with internal reforming. On the one hand, the advantages of working with high H2O/AcOH ratio are that it ensures high catalyst stability by avoiding carbon deposition and prevents the system from corrosion. Moreover H2 yield is enhanced with an excess of H2O, as it is predicted from thermodynamic calculations. On the other hand, there are also disadvantages working with a high H2O/AcOH ratio: more energy is consumed in fuel evaporation, thus diminishing the energy efficiency. Additionally, with high H2O/AcOH ratios the volume of the power generator, starting from the fuel tank up to the fuel cell, must be increased, resulting in higher system costs. Hence, H2O/AcOH ratio must be as small as possible in order to increase the energy efficiency of entire system. Another drawback of increasing H2O/AcOH ratio is lower CO/CO2 ratios. Whereas CO is electrochemically consumed for generating electricity, CO2 cannot be exploited and it is, therefore, an undesired product of internal SR of SOFC. All things considered H2O/AcOH = 2/1 (corresponding to a concentration of 60 vol% of AcOH) can be established as an optimal molar ratio to obtain a balance with respect to the water fed to the system. In fact higher ratios do not enhance the total production of the desired products, since as the ratio increases H2 production is rising but CO decreases. Specifically at higher temperature than 700 °C for H2O/AcOH higher than 2/1 the yield to desired product remains constant, production reaches its maximum with 4 mol of desired gas for each mole of AcOH converted. For the fixed concentration of 60 vol% of AcOH the operating conditions for its SR can be optimized to obtain the maximum H2 and CO formation with complete conversion of AcOH. Concerning the temperature, it has been shown that CO production steadily rises with increasing temperature and that the maximum H2 production is obtained at 700 °C and 1 bar. Thus, the system performance is optimized working at a temperature higher than 700 °C and atmospheric pressure. These operating conditions satisfy all the criteria for high H2 yield followed with low CH4 production, higher formation of CO than of CO2 (CO/CO2 ratio higher than 1.3), and negligible carbon production. The efficiency of the fuel cell is also influenced by the economic utilization of the produced heat. The SOFC is generally working at high temperatures between 700 and 1000 °C. In a fuel cell operated with internal reformer a thermal coupling between the exothermic electrochemical reaction and the endothermic steam reforming is demanded [26,27]. Taken into account that SR of 60 vol% AcOH occurs optimally at temperature higher than 700 °C, the use of the waste heat from the fuel cell to evaporate the fuel and to operate the steam reforming reaction is recommended. Therefore, both reactions can be performed very close together without any thermal shield using a heat exchanger. Finally, the system performance is increased by operating the SR reaction at high temperature."
8,Conclusions,"In this thermodynamic analysis of AcOH steam reforming the reactions involved were investigated as function of temperature, pressure and H2O/AcOH ratio. The study was especially focused on H2 and CO productions, which are the fuels in SOFC. It was demonstrated that steam reforming (SR), water-gas shift reaction (WGS) and thermal decomposition (TD) are the main reactions that should be considered in order to understand the equilibrium of the AcOH SR system. Temperature is the parameter which mainly influences product equilibrium distribution of AcOH SR. Its increment favors SR reaction to happen, but it hinders exothermic TD and WGS reaction. H2O/AcOH fed ratio is the second most important parameter, affecting significantly WGS equilibrium and SR reactions. Pressure is the parameter with the lowest influence, disfavoring SR as it increases, and so increasing the contribution of TD at equilibrium. It can be concluded that AcOH SR is feasible from a thermodynamic point of view even at low H2O/AcOH molar ratios, considering that all kinetic restrictions could be overcome [6]. Focusing on obtaining a H2 and CO rich gas mixture it could be noticed that the highest CO production is obtained at low H2O/AcOH ratios and high temperatures. The maximum production of H2 is reached at slightly lower temperatures and at high H2O/AcOH ratios. Actually, due to the WGSR, with rising H2 production the CO concentration is reduced. For an optimal H2O/AcOH ratio of 2 to 1, corresponding to around 60 vol% AcOH, 1 bar and a higher temperature than 700 °C are the optimal operation conditions for achieving the maximum H2 and CO production. Therefore, considering the whole system of both reformer and SOFC, it can be concluded that working with a high concentrated solution of AcOH (H2O/AcOH = 2/1) required for an energetically efficient system, the operating conditions inside the reformer match well with operating conditions of the SOFC."
