0,Introduction,"Nowadays, higher alcohols (C2+ alcohols) are more desirable products, as neat alcohol fuels, fuel additives, and fine chemicals, than methanol. The main technical routes for the production of C2+ alcohols include catalytic synthesis via syngas and biological fermentation [1–3]. However, these synthetic routes also face many great challenges [5,6]. Despite the conversion of syngas to many different products, such as hydrocarbons and methanol, has been widely applied in the large-scale industrial production [6], the catalytic synthesis of C2+ alcohols is severely limited on the small-scale studies due to lack of suitable catalysts. From a commercial point of view, the catalytic activity, selectivity and yield of C2+ alcohols [4] for current transition metal catalysts are fairly poor, and significant improvements should be achieved to make this synthetic route more attractive [7–9]. Meanwhile, as a fuel additive, ethanol has spurred the people's particular interest because it can be produced by biological fermentation from renewable biomass-derived sugars [4,8,10]. Nevertheless, the fermentation process requires to consume a large number of biomass feedstock, e.g. corn and sugar cane, so as to result in the problem of a rapid rise in the price of sugars and food during the extensive application of ethanol. Moreover, compared with the alcoholic fermentation, it is difficult to produce C5+ alcohols [6–8] with high yield by yeast metabolism during the fermentation process, and the C5+ alcohols selectivity is highly dependent of the genus [11], specie and strain of yeast and the specific nutrients (nitrogen and amino acids) [10]. Low conversion rate of raw material and low concentration of C5+ alcohols lead to high production cost [12,13], which cannot meet the requirements of industrial production and commercial operation. Actually, in the higher alcohols, C5+ alcohols are even more remarkable due to its utilization as high value-added fine chemicals and its high heating values as diesel additives [14–16]. Accordingly, how to furtherly improve the proportion of C5+ alcohols in the total alcohol products is extremely challenge [17]. Recently, several new attempts have been made to produce higher alcohols from cellulosic materials and sugar polyols via chem-catalytic approach. Ford group developed one-pot conversion process to produce C2–C6 aliphatic alcohols and methylated derivatives from wood and cellulosic solids using supercritical methanol and CuMgAl metal oxide catalyst [18–20]. Mixed non-noble metal-oxide catalyst systems were also employed by Su group and Huber group in supercritical methanol, and the similar results with that of Ford group were acquired. Tomishige group have found that Ir-ReOx/SiO2 or modified Ir-ReOx/SiO2 catalyst in biphasic solvent system was active for selective hydrogenolysis of CO bond rather than CC bond, which could be connected to the achievement of good yields of pentanols/hexanols. However, the use of supercritical methanol required the harsh reaction conditions operating at 300–320 °C and 160–220 bar, while the discontinuous operations as well as the expensive cost of IrRe bimetal catalyst were making it less attractive in view of large-scale production [21–24]. The purpose of our present research is to explore such a process capable of converting sugar alcohols derived from biomass resources to higher alcohols by catalytic hydrogenolysis [25–27], and preferably with high selectivity to higher value C5+ alcohols. Our previous works mainly focused that the transformation of sugar polyols to renewable C5–C6 alkanes over Ru-Mo/C catalysts [28–30] by the selective dissociation of CO bonds and suppressing the excessive cleavage of CC bonds [31,32]. In contrast, in order to produce C2+ alcohols, the CO bonds in sorbitol should be selectively cleaved, while the excessive dissociation of CO bonds to form alkanes should be efficiently prohibited [33]. As a typical ordered mesoporous carbon material, the superior performance of CMK-3 has been widely known in aqueous catalysis as a water-tolerant support, owing to high surface areas, periodic mesopores, uniform pore size, adequate pore volume and high hydrothermal and chemical stabilities. Presently, we effectively designed the RuMo bi-functional catalysts supported on the mesoporous carbon CMK-3, and successfully applied them in the catalytic hydrogenolysis of sorbitol. It was found that the synergetic effect of Ru and Mo species, different Ru precursors and the mesoporous channel effect of CMK-3 were the key factors for direct hydrogenolysis of sorbitol to higher alcohols [28–37]."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of the catalysts,"2.1 Synthesis of the catalysts According to the literature's preparation process [38], the synthesis of CMK-3 was performed using SBA-15 silica as the template and sucrose as the carbon source. Commercial activated carbon (AC) was supplied by Huaneng carbon Co., Ltd. (Hebei, China), and its corresponding BET surface area and pore volumes are 1240 m2/g and 0.81 ml/g, respectively. Firstly, the prepared CMK-3 support or AC support was washed several times with boiling deionized water and ethanol, and then was dried in a vacuum oven at 180 °C for 12 h. Subsequently, the CMK-3 supported catalyst was prepared by wet impregnation. The pretreated CMK-3 was impregnated with the isopropanol solution containing an appropriate Ru/Mo acetylacetonate (C15H21O6Ru, C10H14MoO6, Sigma) in a 100-ml beaker. After ultrasonic dispersion for 90 min at room temperature, the obtained sample was dried at 393 K overnight. Finally, the dried sample was calcined at 673 K for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 K/min in N2 flow. The as-made samples were denoted as Ru-Mo(acac)/CMK-3, wherein “acac” indicated the metal precursors of ruthenium acetylacetonate and molybdenyl acetylacetonate. On the basis of above preparation, Ru(acac)/CMK-3, Ru(cl)/CMK-3, Ru(cl)/AC catalysts were also prepared as references, wherein Ru(cl) indicated ruthenium(III) chloride hydrate."
3,Catalyst characterizations and performance testing,"2.2 Catalyst characterizations and performance testing The crystalline structure of the catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Rigaku SmartLab (3 KW, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm, Philip) operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. An unmonochromated Al Ka radiation (Thermo ESCALAB 250XI, America, hv = 1486.6 eV, P = 150 W) was employed during XPS experiments and the transmission energy was 50 eV. As the strong overlap of XPS regions between C 1s (284 eV) and Ru 3d (281 eV), the Ru 3p (484 eV) was selected for further analysis. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using FEI Quanta 400 FEG (America), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using Talos F200S (Czech Republic) and SEM-EDS were used to study the textural properties and morphologies of the samples. Textural properties of catalysts were determined by N2 isothermal (77 K) adsorption on TP-5080 automated system (Tianjin, China). The tested carbons were out-gassed under vacuum at 573 K (10 K/min) for 8 h prior to start the measurements. The specific surface area was calculated by the classical BET method at 77 K using MicroActive for ASAP 2460 (America), and the porosity property was evaluated by BJH method. Gaseous products were analyzed on line by GC (TCD, FID, ±5%) (Kechuang, Shanghai). Liquid products were condensed and collected (275 K), and then analyzed off line by GC (Shimadzu GC-2030 Pro) and by HPLC (Waterse 2695). GC–MS (ISQ DQ, Thermo Fisher) equipped with a HP-INNOWax capillary column was applied to analyze the species in aqueous phase samples. Aqueous catalytic reactions were carried out in a tubular stainless steel fixed-bed reactor (inner diameter of 10 mm, length of 370 mm) and a slurry reactor (50 ml stainless steel autoclave, 600 rpm) at 4.0 MPa, respectively. For each run, 4.0 ml catalyst (≈0.5 g) was loaded in the constant temperature zone of the reactor. The oxidic catalysts were in-site reduced in a flow of H2 (45 ml/min) at 623 K for 4 h. During reaction, 20 wt% sorbitol solutions were pumped into the fixed-bed reactor at the flow rate of 0.02 ml/min by a high pressure liquid pump (HPLP). In a typical slurry experiment, 0.10 g prepared catalyst after reduction and 20.0 g sorbitol solution (20.0 wt%) were introduced into the autoclave, and subsequently the sealed reactor was flushed with H2 for 6 times to remove the air residue, followed by pressurizing H2 to 4.0 MPa at room temperature. After 24 h reaction at 523 K, the autoclave was cooled down immediately in the ice-cold water, and the gaseous products were collected by a sampling bag for off-line analysis."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Characterization of the catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of the catalysts The X-ray diffraction patterns of fresh samples were displayed in Fig. 1A, and the corresponding XRD patterns of AC and CMK-3, Ru-Mo(acac)/CMK-3 after reduction and reaction were presented in supplementary materials. Considering the very low Ru (2 wt%) and Mo (2 wt%) loadings, there were no obvious XRD diffraction peaks attributed to Ru and Mo species. Based on this result, it could imply that the Ru and Mo species nanoparticles were very small and well dispersed over the carrier surface. For all of the measurements, the two broad diffraction peaks of all samples appeared at around 24° and 42°, corresponding to the amorphous carbon. Moreover, the low-angle XRD patterns of CMK-3 and Ru-Mo/CMK-3 were also shown in Fig. 1B. Similar to CMK-3, the Ru-Mo/CMK-3 sample showed a well-ordered mesoporous structure, and the most intense diffraction peak together with one weak peak were assigned to (100) and (110) planes of hexagonal structure (p6mm), respectively. The test results of structural properties suggested that the ordered mesoporous structure of CMK-3 support was remained after introduction of Ru and Mo species. Table 1 presented the textural properties of the related samples. The BET surface area of the original CMK-3 and AC was about 992 m2/g and 1240 m2/g, respectively. Therefore, the mesoporous CMK-3 with high specific surface area was one preferred support for loading the highly dispersed metal nanoparticles. Total pore volume of AC and Ru(cl)/AC was 0.81 cm3/g and 0.66 cm3/g, and that of CMK-3, Ru(acac)/CMK-3 and Ru-Mo(acac)/CMK-3 was 1.33 cm3/g, 1.36 cm3/g and 1.27 cm3/g, respectively. The average pore diameter of the CMK-3 carrier was about 4.8 nm, which was larger than that (4.1 nm) of the AC carrier. Upon incorporation of transition metals into CMK-3, the BET surface area decreased obviously, and the average pore diameter and total pore volume barely changed. Compared with the AC carrier, the mesoporous CMK-3 possessed well-ordered mesoporous channel structures and larger pore sizes, which were beneficial for adsorption/desorption and diffusion of intermediate compound in the hydrogenolysis of non-volatile sorbitol. Interestingly, the follow-up experimental results confirmed that the CMK-3 supported catalyst had a remarkable influence on the performance of sorbitol hydrogenolysis, and the yield of C2+ alcohols was clearly promoted to 8.5% (Ru(cl)/CMK-3) from 0.8% (Ru(cl)/AC) in the fixed-bed reactor (Table 2 ). Hereinto, this positive performance of the CMK-3 supported metal catalyst could be ascribed to the carrier's excellent properties, most likely suggesting the presence of channel effect. (See Table 3 .) The morphology of the CMK-3 supported catalysts was analyzed by SEM and TEM techniques. As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 , the ordered mesoporous structure of CMK-3 support was clearly revealed, which was further confirmed by the TEM images. It was unable to directly observe and distinguish the Ru nanoparticles supported on the CMK-3 surface by SEM. In contrast, the TEM observations confirmed that the Ru and Mo nanoparticles over the Ru-Mo(acac)/CMK-3 were uniformly dispersed on the carrier surface. The average particle size of Ru was around 2.4 nm in the range of 1.0–4.0 nm. As expected, the corresponding elemental mapping analysis of Ru and Mo particles were in full agreement with the XRD data, indicating the small dimensions, high dispersion and low relative crystallinity. To further study the elemental valence state, XPS characterization of Ru and Mo species in Ru(acac)/CMK-3, Ru(cl)/AC and Ru-Mo(acac)/CMK-3 catalysts was investigated. The Ru 3p and Mo 3d XPS data of the related samples was displayed in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 . The Ru 3p3/2 peaks at 462.0–462.8 eV were attributed to the presence of metallic Ru in the as-made samples. In addition, the Mo 3d spectra (Mo 3d5/2, 3/2) was deconvoluted into four peaks corresponding to the three oxidation states of Mo6+ (232.8, 236.0 eV), Mo5+ (231.5, 234.7 eV) and Mo4+ (228.5, 231.7 eV). During the thermal treatment in N2 atmosphere, the Mo and Ru species with high valence could be reduced to the lower oxidation state Mo or metallic Ru by the surface oxygenated groups on the CMK-3 carrier, which was in good agreement with observations reported in the literature. After reduction, the Mo6+ content decreased remarkably, and the Mo5+ and Mo4+ fraction became much higher. The reason was ascribed to that the addition of Ru promoted the reduction of Mo6+ to Mo5+ and Mo4+ species, as revealed by XPS analysis in Fig. 5. More interestingly, in comparison with that of reduced Ru(cl)/AC, the Ru 3p3/2 peaks of Ru-Mo(acac)/CMK-3 after reduction was obviously shifted to the lower binding energy, which was attributed to different Ru precursors and different carriers. After introducing of Mo species, the peak corresponding to Ru 3p3/2 could drift slightly, and this phenomenon might be explained reasonably by interaction of Ru and Mo species. To clarify interactions between Ru and Mo species, the reducibility of Ru(acac)/CMK-3 and Ru-Mo(acac)/CMK-3 was studied by H2-TPR in Fig. 6 . The H2 consumption peaks took place at the low temperature (around 100 °C), assigned to the reduction of RuO2. Moreover, the TPR profiles illustrated one broad band in the range of 300 °C~800 °C, which partially overlapped with that of Mo species at the high temperature. For the CMK-3 supported catalysts, it originated from the reduction of oxygenated groups on the carbon surface. By comparing with the profile of Ru(acac)/CMK-3, the TPR peaks of Ru-Mo(acac)/CMK-3 shifted toward higher temperature, demonstrating different H2-TPR behaviours after introduction of Mo species. Generally, this appearance on the reducibility could be associated with a negative effect of non-noble metal oxide with high valence. Accordingly, the H2-TPR results concluded that the particular close interaction between Ru and Mo clearly present, which correlated well with the XPS results above."
6,Catalytic activity in sorbitol hydrogenolysis,"3.2 Catalytic activity in sorbitol hydrogenolysis In order to compare the effect of reactor types, the hydrogenolysis of sorbitol was carried out in a 50 ml stainless steel autoclave equipped with mechanical stirring, and a fixed-bed reactor (inner diameter of 10 mm, length of 370 mm), respectively. The reactors were electrically heated with automatic temperature control (accuracy ±1 °C). Prior to the reaction, the prepared catalysts were reduced under a flow of H2 (45 ml/min) at 623 K for 4 h. Generally, in the sorbitol hydrogenolysis, the production of C2+ alcohols was strongly depended on the catalyst characteristics, the reaction conditions and the reactor types. Therefore, the effect of reaction temperature, reaction pressure and reaction time on the sorbitol hydrogenolysis in the slurry reactor was firstly investigated in Fig. 7 . The products of C1–C6 alkanes in the gas phase were detected by GC on line. After reaction, the products of C2+ alcohols in the aqueous phase were identified by GC off line. The C2+ alcohols mainly included ethanol, 1-pentanol, 2-pentanol, 2-hexanol, propanol, 1,2-pentanediol and 1,6-hexanediol. The effect of temperature on the distribution of C2+ alcohols was shown in Fig. 7A. Moreover, in the case of fixed-bed reactor, the effect of temperature on the sorbitol hydrogenolysis was also studied in Fig. 8 . As the reaction temperature increased from 473 K to 523 K, the yield of C2+ alcohols significantly increased from 1.1% to 6.2%. Substantially, the increasing temperature could promote the C2+ alcohols yield by advancing the hydrogenolysis reaction rate. Obviously, the high temperature gave rise to deep HDO by the excessive cleavage of CO bonds over the Ru-Mo(acac)/CMK-3 catalyst, resulting in the formation of gaseous alkanes; while the low temperature brought about not only the low conversion of sorbitol but also the formation of intermediate oxygenated compounds. Consequently, to obtain the higher yield of C2+ alcohols (6.2% for the slurry reactor, 49.0% for the fixed-bed reactor), the optimum reaction temperature for this reaction was about 523 K, and too-high or too-low temperature would decrease the catalytic performance of sorbitol hydrogenolysis in both the slurry reactor and the fixed-bed reactor [39]. (See Fig. 9 .) The effect of the initial pressure (room temperature) on the sorbitol hydrogenolysis in the slurry reactor was investigated at 523 K. As shown in Fig. 7B, the increasing pressure from 2.0 MPa to 4.0 MPa had a positive effect on the C2+ alcohols formation, and the C2+ alcohols yield increased from 2.3% to 6.2%. However, the over-high H2 pressure could favor hydrogenation by increasing the H2 concentration on the metal active sites, causing the carbon transfer from aqueous phase to gaseous phase. When the H2 pressure reached 6.0 MPa, the yield of C2+ alcohols sharply decreased to 3.5%. Thus, the H2 pressure of 4.0 MPa was selected as the preferential reaction pressure in the slurry reactor. Moreover, the effect of reaction time was also examined in Fig. 7C. By increasing the reaction time, the yield of C2+ alcohols was gradually increased from 4.7% (12 h) to 6.2% (24 h). With the further increase of reaction time (48 h), a low yield (4.3%) of C2+ alcohols was obtained. The long reaction time could bring about the over‑hydrogenolysis of sorbitol, and the product distribution shifted to gaseous alkanes. For this catalytic system of slurry reactor, the yield of C2+ alcohols was maintained at a low level below 6.2% even under the preferential condition (523 K, 4 MPa H2, 24 h, 20 wt% sorbitol solution), and the high C1–C6 alkanes yield of approximately 14% was unavoidable. In this case, the further restraining of deep HDO may seem to be very necessary and also important to obtain the high yield of C2+ alcohols [40]. Apart from the reaction temperature, H2 pressure and reaction time, the reactor type was also considered as one key influence parameter for the aqueous phase hydrogenolysis of sorbitol, which could change the phase states of reactants even reaction mechanism. Fig. 8 displayed the results of the sorbitol hydrogenolysis over the AC and CMK-3 supported catalysts on a fixed-bed continuous-flow reactor at 523 K. The corresponding carbon distribution of products and the typical GC chromatograms of gaseous alkanes were shown in Fig. 8B and Table 2, respectively. The Ru(cl)/AC catalyst exhibited the excellent hydrogenolysis activity resulting in non-selective cleavage of CC and CO bonds in sorbitol [28,29]. As a result, about 80% carbon of sorbitol was transformed to C1–C4 alkanes, especially including 55.9% methane. This result confirmed to the experimental data reported in some published literatures, which could be attributed to the metallic nature of Ru. Obviously, the support effect of the CMK-3 carrier had a remarkable influence on the performance of sorbitol hydrogenolysis into C2+ alcohols [26], and its yield was promoted to 8.5%. Hereinto, this support effect was probably ascribed to its well-ordered mesoporous channels and larger pore sizes, which were conducive to adsorption/desorption of reactants and diffusion of intermediate compound in the sorbitol hydrogenolysis. In contrast with the Ru(cl)/CMK-3 catalyst, the Ru(acac)/CMK-3 catalyst presented a higher C2+ alcohols yield which was advanced from 8.5% to 23.1%, pointing that the different Ru precursors significantly affected the catalytic performance. With the presence of different Ru precursors, the Ru(acac)/CMK-3 catalyst could greatly suppress the excessive breakage of CC and CO bonds [28,29], resulting in only 3.4% yield of gaseous alkanes. Actually, the XPS data above supported these effects of different Ru precursors and mesoporous carriers. More interestingly, by introducing Mo species into the Ru-based catalysts, the Ru-Mo(acac)/CMK-3 catalyst could furtherly suppress deep HDO and the yields of C2+ alcohols was greatly promoted from 23.1% to 49.0%(See Table 3). On the other hand, it showed a lower yield (1.6%) of C1–C6 alkanes, which could be almost negligible. These results were exactly in keeping with the corresponding carbon distribution of products and the typical GC chromatograms of gaseous alkanes. As reported previously, of great importance is the synergetic effect of Ru and Mo species that the introduction of proper Mo species with partially reduced states (MoO3−x) was selective cleavage for CO bonds in effectively transforming several biomass-derived oxygenates into the C2+ alcohols. After the modification with 2 wt% Mo, evident promotion effect was observed, and the deep HDO was basically avoided. Very importantly, nearly 50% carbon was remained in the aqueous phase, which was in the form of intermediate oxygenated compounds such as isosorbitol, sorbitan, mannitol, 1,2,6-hexanetriol, 1,2,4-butanetriol and so on. Moreover, the yield of C2+ alcohols could be greatly enhanced because these intermediates could be potentially converted to C2+ alcohols by further cyclic transformation. Comparing with the slurry reactor, it could be seen that the fixed-bed continuous-flow reactor decreasing the contact time, which effectively reduced the rate of CO bond cleavage in the oxygenated intermediates to form C1–C6 alkanes [39–44], leading to the higher yield of C2+ alcohols. Taken together, the Ru-Mo/CMK-3 was successfully designed using simple co-impregnation and efficiently applied in the production of C2+ alcohols. It was found that the synergetic effect of Ru and Mo species, different Ru precursors and the support effect of CMK-3 were the key for direct hydrogenolysis of sorbitol to higher alcohols. The experimental results indicated that the promising yield of C2+ alcohols in the products could reach 49.0%, and that of higher value C5+ alcohols could reach 29.9%."
7,Conclusion,"In a word, this work presented a new approach for the C2+ alcohols synthesis by the catalytic hydrogenolysis of sugar alcohol over the Ru-Mo/CMK-3 catalyst. The effects of reaction conditions such as reaction temperature, reaction pressure, reaction time and reactor type were investigated respectively, and the maximum C2+ alcohols yield of 49.0% was achieved at 523 K in the fixed-bed continuous-flow reactor. The highlighted efficiency of the catalysts was attributed to the synergetic effect of Ru and Mo species, different Ru precursors and the support effect of CMK-3, which was responsible for the unusual catalytic activity in the sorbitol hydrogenolysis. The cleavage of CO bonds was effectively controlled, and the generation of C1–C6 alkanes by deep hydrodeoxygenation was basically inhibited. Furthermore, the intermediate oxygenated compounds, whereas nearly 50% of the original carbon was in the form of aqueous side products, could be potentially converted to C2+ alcohols by further cyclic transformation."
