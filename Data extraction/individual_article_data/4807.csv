0,Introduction,"The rapid depletion of non-renewable fossil fuels has resulted in a global energy crisis, and the development of sustainable alternative fuels has attracted increasing interest all around the world. As the most abundant renewable source in nature, biomass is extensively developed for producing various alternative fuels, such as biohydrogen, bioethanol, biobutanol and biodiesel. Among the biofuels, biohydrogen is known as an ideal renewable energy because of its high energy content and lack of carbon emissions from combustion (Gonzales et al., 2016). Biobutanol is also a high-performance fuel and fits better than ethanol with the current fuel distribution infrastructure because of its low hygroscopicity (Chen et al., 2016). Acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation of clostridia is well-known for butanol production from glucose and has been extensively investigated (Lertsriwong et al., 2017). In the fermentation process, produced butyric acid serves as the triggering substance to induce the transcription of solvent formation genes in the strains (Wang et al., 2013). In addition, external addition of butyric acid as the co-substrate can prevent strains from degeneration and enhance sugar utilization and butanol yield (Regestein et al., 2015). However, most of the commercial butyric acid is produced from fossil fuels by chemical processes, which is not sustainable or economical (Zhang et al., 2009). Therefore, the fermentative butyric acid from lignocellulosic biomass is a promising alternative. Generally, lignocellulosic biomass for biofuel production has to firstly undergo pretreatment (physical, chemical, or their combination) and enzymatic hydrolysis to produce fermentable sugars (Jin et al., 2015). However, the enzymes used for hydrolysis will inevitably result in a great increase in production cost (Green, 2011). Carboxylate Platform has been proposed to reduce or avoid enzymatic pretreatment by employing microbial consortia to convert biomass to short-chain carboxylic acids, such as acetic, propionic, butyric, and other acids (Chang et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2015). The short-chain carboxylic acids can be used as feedstock to generate biofuels such as ethanol and butanol by bacterial fermentation or using electrochemical and thermochemical methods (Agler et al., 2011). Therefore, Carboxylate Platform was introduced to produce butyric acid, along with some other volatile fatty acids (VFAs) as by-products from rice straw by the fermentation of a microbial consortium in the present study. Then, the collected supernatant of fermentation culture (SFC) was used as a co-substrate to produce butanol by ABE fermentation of Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 (Ye et al., 2012; Hartmanis et al., 1984; Harvey and Meylemans, 2011). The ABE-producing clostridia as an excellent hydrogen producer has been largely ignored. In fact, in addition to ABE fermentation, hydrogen can also be collected during acidogenic fermentation (Kuribayashi et al., 2017). To reduce the enzyme involvement in lignocellulosic butanol and enhance energy generation, a novel two-stage fermentation process was constructed by combining a Carboxylate Platform and an ABE fermentation. The coproduction of hydrogen and butanol was evaluated, while the carbon-flow distribution, mass balance and energy generation were analyzed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Material preparation,"2.1 Material preparation The rice straw used for butyric acid fermentation and enzymatic hydrolysis was collected from a local farm in Harbin, China. The raw rice straw was cut into 10–15 cm lengths and pretreated with 1% NaOH solution as described previously (Ai et al., 2016). Mass fraction of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in the pretreated rice straw was 53.0%, 27.4% and 8.0%, respectively. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the pretreated rice straw was carried out in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks located in an air-bath incubator (DLHR-Q200, Hadonglian, China) at 50 °C and 140 runs per minute (rpm). Each of the flasks was loaded with 80 g/L pretreated rice straw and 100 mL 0.05 mol/L acetate as buffer (pH 4.8). The cellulase (Sigma Chemicals) load in each flask was the same 30 FPU/g dry pretreated rice straw in terms of filter paper activity (FAP). To get a final substrate concentration of 120 g/L, the pretreated rice straw (20 g/L) was added twice at the 12th and 24th hour during hydrolysis with the cellulase (10 FPU/g dry pretreated rice straw). At the 72nd hour of hydrolysis, the flasks were autoclaved at 115 °C for 20 min, and then the rice straw hydrolysate was collected via centrifugation and stored at 4 °C (no longer than 4 h) for ABE fermentation tests. The reducing sugar concentration in the collected hydrolysate was approximately 94 g/L."
3,Inocula,"2.2 Inocula 2.2.1 Microbial consortium for lignocellulosic butyric acid production The microbial consortium for fermentation of the pretreated rice straw to produce butyric acid was a stable mixed culture obtained previously (Binling et al., 2013) and was designed as consortium DCB17. Consortium DCB17 was dominated by cellulosic and xylanolytic bacteria, butyrate-producing bacteria and other acidogenic bacteria (Ai et al., 2016), which was maintained as spores in fresh peptone cellulose solution (PCS) medium at 4 °C. The PCS medium contained the following per 1 L distilled water: 10 g pretreated rice straw, 5.0 g tryptone, 1.0 g yeast extract, 5.0 g NaCl, 2.0 g CaCO3, and 0.5 g D-cysteine hydrochloride. 2.2.2 Strain for ABE fermentation C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 obtained from the China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center (CGMCC) was used for synchronous production of butanol and hydrogen by ABE fermentation. The strain was maintained in the form of spores in fresh peptone-yeast glucose (PYG) medium at 4 °C (Chen et al., 2013). For inoculum preparation, the stored spore suspension was transferred into fresh P2 medium containing 10.0 g/L glucose and then incubated at 140 rpm and 37 °C for 18–22 h. After incubation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The harvested cells were suspended in 1 mL of P2 medium and the bacterial suspension was used as inoculum. The P2 medium contained the following per 1 L distilled water: 30.0 g glucose, 3.0 g yeast extract, 0.5 g K2HPO4, 0.5 g KH2PO4, 0.001 g p-aminobenzoic acid, 0.001 g thiamine, 0.0001 g biotin, 0.2 g MgSO4·7H2O, 0.01 g MnSO4·H2O, 0.01 g FeSO4·7H2O, and 0.01 g NaCl."
4,Fermentation tests,"2.3 Fermentation tests 2.3.1 Acidogenic fermentation As the first stage in the proposed two-stage fermentation process, acidogenic fermentation of consortium DCB17 was performed in 500 mL serum bottles, each of which contained 200 mL PCS medium and 20 g/L pretreated rice straw in terms of dry weight. The broth was adjusted to a pH of 6.5 with 4 mol/L HCl solution and flushed with N2 for 10 min. After autoclaving at 115 °C for 20 min and cooling to room temperature, 5% (v/v) of the stored consortium DCB17 was inoculated. All of the fermentation systems were incubated at 35 °C and 140 rpm for 6 days. Biogas in each of the fermentation systems was measured daily, and approximately 1.3 mL broths were sampled for pH and liquid product detection. Weight loss from the rice straw in each of the systems was measured at the end of fermentation. 2.3.2 ABE fermentation ABE fermentation of C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 was performed in M-1, M-2 and M-3 mediums. In M-1, glucose was the only carbon source with a concentration of 30.0 g/L. In addition to the 30.0 g/L glucose, 6.25 g/L sodium butyrate (5.00 g/L in terms of butyric acid) was added in M-2 as co-substrate. M-3 was prepared with 40% (v/v) rice straw hydrolysate and 60% (v/v) SFC mixed with the nutrients in P2. After acidogenic fermentation of the pretreated rice straw, SFC was collected via centrifugation to remove the insoluble and microbial residues. The SFC was used as co-substrate of the rice straw hydrolysate for hydrogen and butanol production by C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052. 30 mL SFC and the nutrients in P2 medium were transferred into 160-mL screw capped bottles and flushed with N2 for 10 min. The bottles were sealed and sterilized in an autoclave at 115 °C for 20 min. After naturally cooling down to room temperature, each of the bottles were inoculated with the bacterial suspension of C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 and 20 mL sterile rice straw hydrolysate in sequence (M-3). The inoculation amount of the strain was determined by the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 1.0 in the 50-mL broth. M-1 and M-2 were inoculated in the same way, and 20 mL of 2.5-fold concentrated sterile glucose solution was added instead of the rice straw hydrolysate. The fermentation systems constructed with M-1 acted as the controls with a pH of approximately 6.8. An initial pH of approximately 5.0, adjusted with 4 mol/L HCl solution, was used in the M-2 and M-3 fermentations. Each test was performed in triplicate, and all of the cultures were incubated at 37 °C and 140 rpm. During the 6-day fermentation process, biogas in each of the fermentation systems was measured daily with approximately 1.3 mL broths sampled with syringes. After the determination of pH, the samples were diluted and used to monitor the concentrations of sugar, VFAs and solvents. Carbon-flow distribution of ABE fermentations were analyzed, the detail calculation method were shown in the Supporting file."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The biogas produced in each of the fermentation systems was measured by releasing the gas pressure to equilibrate with room pressure (Binling et al., 2013). The composition of the biogas was analyzed with a gas chromatograph (SP-6800A, Shandong Lunan Instrument Factory, China) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a 2-m stainless column packed with Porapak Q (60/80 mesh, Lanzhou ZhongKeKaiDi Chemical Newtech Co., Ltd, China). The carrier gas was N2. The temperature of the column oven was set at 50 °C, and the temperature was set at 80 °C for both the injection port and the detector. The percentage of hydrogen was calculated according to the linear regression equation of standard sample, y = 0.1612 x, with R2 = 0.9955. The concentrations of VFAs and solvents in the culture supernatant were determined by another gas chromatograph (SP-6800, Shandong Lunan Instrument Factory, China) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a 30 m FFAP capillary column (i.d.0.32 mm, SHIMADZU, Japan), also with N2 as the carrier gas. The oven temperature was increased from 50 °C to 170 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min using a temperature program. Both temperatures of the injector and the detector were set at 210 °C. The linear regression equations of standard sample for the concentration calculation of acetone, butanol, acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, isovaleric and valeric acids were y = 0.125 x (R2 = 0.9968), y = 0.1248 x (R2 = 0.9980), y = 0.7997 x (R2 = 0.9968), y = 0.526 x (R2 = 0.9987), y = 0.4123 x (R2 = 0.9990), y = 0.5028 x (R2 = 0.9994), y = 0.4909 x (R2 = 0.9997), y = 0.6049 x (R2 = 0.9999), respectively. The concentrations of xylose, glucose and cellobiose during ABE fermentations were detected by a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (LC-10AVP, SHIMADZU, Japan) equipped with a refraction index detector (RID-10A, Waters, USA) and an HPX-87H column (Bio-rad, Hercules, CA). The operating temperature was 70 °C with 0.005 mol/L H2SO4 as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min, and the injection sample volume was 50 μL. The weight loss of rice straw during acidogenic fermentation was calculated as described previously (Binling et al., 2013). The concentration of FAP and reducing sugar were determined following the method reported by Ghose (1987). Cell density in ABE fermentation systems were estimated by a spectrophotometer (UV-2450; SHIMADZU, Japan) at OD600. A predetermined correlation between OD600 and dry cell weight (DCW) was prepared beforehand, and an OD600 of 1.0 was equivalent to 0.59 g dry cell per liter."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Hydrogen and butyric acid production in acidogenic fermentation,"3.1 Hydrogen and butyric acid production in acidogenic fermentation The predominant liquid products from the pretreated rice straw fermented with consortium DCB17 were acetic and butyric acids, along with negligible propionic and valeric acids (Binling et al., 2013). Fig. 1 shows the VFAs (butyric and acetic acids mainly) and hydrogen production throughout the acidogenic fermentation. The results showed that production of butyric acid and hydrogen continued until the 5th day. However, the accumulation of acetic acid was only found during the first 2 days. By the end of the 6-day fermentation process, the hydrogen, butyric acid and total VFAs production accumulated to 660 mL/L, 6.87 and 9.52 g/L, respectively, with a rice straw consumption of 15.4 g/L. The specific hydrogen yield (Y hydrogen) and the specific butyric acid yield (Y butyric acid) from the fed rice straw were 33 mL/g and 0.34 g/g, respectively, indicating that consortium DCB17 could degrade lignocellulose efficiently and be used for hydrogen and butyric acid production from pretreated rice straw. Though lignocellulosic biomass can be used as the raw material for hydrogen and VFAs production, it has to be pretreated to reveal the biodegradable cellulose and hemicellulose by removing the lignin (Jin et al., 2015). The yield of target products was remarkably different due to the variation in pretreatment methods (Xia et al., 2016; Cui and Shen, 2012; Han et al., 2012; Forrest et al., 2010). As illustrated in Table 1 , diluted acid and enzymes were efficient in hydrolyzing lignocellulose into fermentable sugars for subsequent acidogenic fermentation, but the production cost has not been calculated (Jørgensen et al., 2007; Xia et al., 2016; Escamilla-alvarado et al., 2016). However, pretreatment under alkaline conditions was more economical, but the yield of target products was lower because the procedure only cleaved the α-ether bonds significantly among lignin and left most of the cellulose and hemicellulose in the solid residues (Jørgensen et al., 2007; Cui and Shen, 2012; Han et al., 2012; Forrest et al., 2010). Comparatively, consortium DCB17 performed better both in Y hydrogen (33 mL/g) and Y butyric acid (0.34 g/g) without additional acids or enzymes, indicating an advantage in fermenting pretreated rice straw for hydrogen and butyric acid production (Table 1)."
8,Hydrogen and butanol production in ABE fermentation,"3.2 Hydrogen and butanol production in ABE fermentation As the triggering substance of solventogenesis in clostridia, butyric acid can also enhance glucose utilization and butanol yield of ABE fermentation (Regestein et al., 2015; Hartmanis et al., 1984; Lee et al., 2008). In the present research, the pretreated rice straw was fermented by consortium DCB17 to obtain a sustainable and low-priced supply of butyric acid (Chang et al., 2010; Ai et al., 2016). The previous studies had indicated that a butyric acid concentration above 5 g/L would inhibit the ABE fermentation of C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052. However, as illustrated in Fig. 1, the concentration of butyric acid in the SFC reached 6.87 g/L. Therefore, P2 medium nutrients dissolved with 60% SFC and 40% rice straw hydrolysates (i.e., M-3) as the substrate for hydrogen and butanol production by the fermentation of C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 using M-1 and M-2 as the controls. As shown as Fig. 2 , cell density in the three media reached almost the same maximum of approximately 4.31 g/L by the 2nd day, and no observable change was found during the remaining fermentation process. However, pH and hydrogen production were markedly different among the three fermentation processes. The pH in M-1 dropped from the initial 6.8 to 4.7 within the first day, and there was a slight increase of pH in M-2 and M-3 due to the buffer effect of carboxylate (Lee et al., 2008). This result indicated that pH control was not necessary for ABE fermentation. During the first day, a hydrogen yield of approximately 1192 mL/L was obtained in M-1, which was noticeably higher than that of 480 and 840 mL/L obtained in M-2 and M-3, respectively. The hydrogen production rates in M-1, M-2 and M-3 were 50, 20 and 35 mL/L/h, respectively. However, decreasing amounts of hydrogen production were found in M-1 from the 2nd day onward, and an accumulative hydrogen yield of 2477 mL/L was obtained by the end of the fermentation process. With 5.06 g/L butyric acid in M-2, a maximum hydrogen production rate of 50 mL/L/h was found on the 2nd day. But the accumulated hydrogen yield throughout fermentation was approximately 2296 mL/L, slightly less than that in M-1. A remarkably higher ability to produce hydrogen was observed in M-3. Its maximum hydrogen production rate reached 104 mL/L/h within the 3rd day, and the accumulated hydrogen yield by the end of fermentation reached 5897 mL/L, both of which were much higher than in M1 or M2. Fig. 3 shows that the sugar consumption in M-2 and M-3 was much higher than that in M-1. After the 6-day fermentation, the consumed sugar was 17.2, 29.5 and 33.1 g/L in M1, M-2 and M-3, respectively. The results indicated that the supplement of butyric acid had enhanced the consumption of glucose in the ABE fermentation. VFAs and solvents in the three fermentations were mainly produced within the first 3 days (Fig. 3), similar to the growth of DCW (Fig. 2). By the end of fermentations, the butanol yield of approximately 6.7 and 11.5 g/L were obtained in M-1 and M-2, respectively. Obviously, the butanol production had been enhanced by the supplied butyric acid (Hartmanis et al., 1984; Lee et al., 2008; Richter et al., 2012). Based on the metabolic pathway of ABE fermentation, decarboxylation of pyruvate in glycolysis is the only reaction for hydrogen release (Jones and Woods, 1986). Compared with M-1, there was less sugar left in M-2 after fermentation (Fig. 3). However, the accumulative hydrogen yield in M-2 (2296 mL/L) was lower than that in M-1 (2477 mL/L) (Fig. 2). This result suggested that more reducing power ([H]) had been produced during glycolysis and used to reduce butyric acid, resulting in the higher butanol production in M-2 (Bramono et al., 2011). It was found that the accumulated hydrogen yield (Fig. 2), as well as the butanol yield (Fig. 3), in M-3 was much higher than that obtained from M-2. Theoretically, 0.56 mol butanol and 1.35 mol hydrogen would be produced from 1 mol glucose in ABE fermentation (Jones and Woods, 1986). Thus, the extra consumed sugar of 3.6 g/L in M-3 should theoretically produce 0.82 g/L butanol and 604 mL/L hydrogen. However, there was 2.3 g/L more butanol and 3601 mL/L more hydrogen produced in M-3 than that in M-2. It was thought that the acetic acid (1.90 g/L) coming from the rice straw hydrolysate (Fig. 3) had enhanced butanol production in ABE fermentation in M-3 (Chen and Blaschek, 1999). Because hydrogen would not be produced from acetic acid (Bramono et al., 2011), there must be other carbon sources in the SFC that had contributed to the extra production of hydrogen production. Though the mechanism of the enhanced butanol and hydrogen production by the SFC was not clear, it was undeniable that the SFC enhanced hydrogen and butanol production in the ABE fermentation of C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052."
9,Carbon flux and mass balance of the two-stage fermentation process,"3.3 Carbon flux and mass balance of the two-stage fermentation process Carbon-flow distribution was used to check the consistency of the data and identify the most likely metabolic pathways of the ABE fermentation. All fluxes were given in C-mol carbon transferred and referred to 100 C-mol glucose and xylose in total, as outlined in Fig. 4 . The major fraction of the metabolites were occupied by butanol both in M-1 and M-3. But, the fractional carbon distributions in solvent metabolites of M-1 and M-3 were 9.3% and 6.6% of acetone and 37.8%, and 38.9% of butanol, respectively, indicating that the addition of the SFC demoted the acetone producing pathway and up-regulated the butanol producing pathway, which is in accordance with the fermentation results (Fig. 3). A mass balance for the two-stage fermentation process is shown in Fig. 5 . The mass balance starting from 1000 g of the pretreated rice straw, the enzymic hydrolysis and butyric acid fermentation were performed for providing substrates to ABE fermentation. The enzymic hydrolysis obtained 647 g reducing sugar from 800 g pretreated rice straw with 420 and 153 g of glucose and xylose, respectively. The butyric acid fermentation produced 95 g VFAs from 200 g pretreated rice straw occupied with 15 and 69 g acetic acid and butyric acid, respectively. The highest butanol production obtained is 230 g/kg pretreated rice straw using the hydrolysate from 800 g pretreated rice straw and the VFAs from 200 g pretreated rice straw as co-substrates."
10,Energy generation,"3.4 Energy generation To understand the energy recovery efficiency in the present two-stage fermentation process, the energy generation and the specific energy yield of the pretreated rice straw were calculated according to the combustion heat values of the hydrogen and butanol produced (Gapes, 2000; Luo et al., 2004). In the first stage of the two-stage fermentation process, hydrolysis and acidogenic fermentation of the pretreated rice straw (mainly cellulose and hemicellulose) occurred and only hydrogen could be collected as energy, along with the production of VFAs (Kuribayashi et al., 2017). As illustrated in Table 1, butyric and acetic acids were the dominant VFAs produced in the acidogenic fermentation stage. Accoding to the stoichiometry, 2 mol and 4 mol of hydrogen could be produced along with the production of butyric and acetic acid as expressed as Eq. (1) and Eq. (2), respectively (Kim et al., 2006). (1) C6H12O6 + 2H2O → CH3CH2CH2COO¯ + 2HCO3¯ + 3H+ + 2H2 ΔG 0′ = −254 kJ/mol (2) C6H12O6 + 4H2O → 2CH3COO¯ + 2HCO3¯ + 4H+ + 4H2 ΔG 0′ = −206 kJ/mol Based on the pretreated rice straw consumed and hydrogen yielded (Table 1), the specific energy yield by hydrogen production was counted to 421.7 kJ/kg pretreated rice straw. With the co-substrates of rice straw hydrolysates and SFC, acidogenesis and solventogenesis occurred together in the second stage of the two-stage fermentation process. Thus, both hydrogen (Eq. (1), Eq. (2)) and butanol (Eq. (3), Eq. (4)) could obtained as energy in the ABE fermentation (Huang and Zhang, 2011; Kim et al., 2006). (3) C6H12O6 → CH3CH2CH2CH2OH + 2 CO2 + H2O ΔG 0′ = −273 kJ/mol (4) CH3CH2CH2COO¯ + H+ + 2H2 → CH3CH2CH2CH2OH + H2O ΔG 0′ = −3.6 kJ/mol Again, based on the hydrogen yielded (Fig. 2) and the substrates consumed and butanol produced (Fig. 3), the energy generation from the mixed feedstock of rice straw hydrolysates and SFC was evaluated as 573 kJ/L, with a total specific energy yield of 9549.4 kJ/kg pretreated rice straw. Among the total specific energy yield were 8294.5 and 1254.9 kJ/kg pretreated rice straw from butanol and hydrogen production, respectively. Thus, a total specific energy yield as high as 9633.7 kJ/kg pretreated rice straw was obtained in the two-stage fermentation process. ABE fermentation had previously been carried out by different clostridia with various lignocellulosic biomasses as substrates, such as microalgae (Wang et al., 2015), rice straw (Amiri et al., 2014), bagasse (Cheng et al., 2012), sesame oilcake (Rajagopalan et al., 2016), and barley straw (Qureshi et al., 2010). To evaluate the superiority of the present two-stage fermentation process for biobutanol production, the butanol and hydrogen production and the specific energy yield were compared with the other studies. As illustrated in Table 2 , both the specific yields of butanol and hydrogen obtained in the present study were very notable, resulting in the highest total specific energy yield of 9633.7 kJ/kg pretreated rice straw. Though lignocellulosic hydrolysate had been used as substrate in most of the researches on biobutanol production (Amiri et al., 2014; Cheng et al., 2012; Qureshi et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2015), the exogenous application of enzymes involved in hydrolysis of lignocellulose almost counteracts the benefit from the cheap feedstocks (Jørgensen et al., 2007). Without exogenous application of enzymes in SFC production, the present two-stage fermentation process was more cost-effective because of the reduced exogenous application of enzymes, the increase of butanol/acetone ratio and excellent specific yield of butanol. However, more fermentation equipments required for butyric acid production from the pretreated rice straw may increase the construction investment of the present two-stage fermentation process. To obtain hydrolysate from lignocellulose for ABE fermentation, enzymatic hydrolysis is generally employed in the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass (Qureshi et al., 2010; Amiri et al., 2014). As is known, the saccharification of lignocellulosic biomass is complex and costly. Comparatively, the cost of energy generation in the present two-stage fermentation process would be reduced because of using SFC for ABE fermentation, which is sustainable and can be cost-effectively supplied by the acidogenic fermentation via the carboxylate platform without extra cellulase (Agler et al., 2011). However, hydrogen and butanol production based on the carboxylic acid platform has not been extensively investigated. The present two-stage fermentation process provided a cost-effective approach to energy generation from lignocellulosic biomass by avoiding the application of commercial butyric acid and reducing the cost in pretreatment of rice straw. Other added advantages included that 1) extra hydrogen could be collected as energy in the first stage (the acidogenic fermentation of rice straw), 2) the SFC produced in the acidogenic fermentation of rice straw could not only be used as the substrate but also enhance the hydrogen and butanol production in the second stage (the ABE fermentation), and 3) the SFC acted as a pH buffer during ABE fermentation. The remarkably increased butanol and energy yield made the two-stage fermentation process a good developmental prospect in energy production from renewable biomass."
11,Conclusions,A novel two-stage fermentation process for energy generation from lignocellulose was constructed by combining a Carboxylate Platform and an ABE fermentation. The process was more cost-effective for the coproduction of hydrogen and butanol from rice straw by lowering the involved enzyme requirement and enhancing energy generation. The carbon-flow distribution analysis indicated that the supplement of SFC decreased the metabolic flux of acetone producing pathway and increased the metabolic flux of butanol producing pathway. The two-stage fermentation process is a promising strategy for energy production from renewable biomass.
