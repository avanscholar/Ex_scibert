0,Introduction,"By taking advantage of the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) method, a part can be manufactured from the concept to production in a short time. As an additive manufacturing technology, FDM technology can assist the implant (Way et al., 2014; Winder and Bibb, 2005), manufacture biological model (Way et al., 2014), repair bone tissue (Brunello et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2014), which has a wide range of applications in the field of bioengineering. Compared with other 3D printing process, FDM process helps to ensure the subsequent biocompatibility and biological activity of the material. In most case, support materials are essential to build durable components with complex geometries. Water-soluble polymer materials have been taken account as ideal support materials in FDM field as which help build the final parts or prototypes rapidly and provide more design freedom for the bioengineering field (Ahn et al., 2002; Roberson et al., 2015). Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a biocompatible and water-soluble polymer (Alves et al., 2011; Bolto et al., 2009). Due to its good comprehensive solubility and mechanical properties, PVA has been used in a broad range of applications such as tissue engineering (Schmedlen et al., 2002; Tan et al., 2005), drug release (Anseth et al., 2002; Kweon and Kang, 2015), and membranes (Rhim et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2005). Many works has focused on the modification of PVA, while pure PVA can hardly meet the requirements in 3D printing application as support materials due to its low processability (Alexy et al., 2002; Byun et al., 2008; Ding et al., 2009). The property of PVA needs to be improved in order to widen its range in 3D printing application. In last decades, incorporation of oligomer such as glycerol (Sakellariou et al., 1993; Tudorachi et al., 2000), amides (Bergo et al., 2012; Yan et al., 2015), and alcohol amine (Jiang et al., 2012) into PVA matrix has been explored as an important strategy to obtain PVA-based composites with high processing performance. Jang and Dong (2003) investigated the effect of glycerol on the melting and crystallization behavior of PVA and found glycerol could improve the thermal processability of PVA. Wu et al. (2012) fabricated high-alcoholysis PVA films with sorbitol/pentaerythritol mixture by melt processing and found that hydrogen bonding interactions occurred between sorbitol/pentaerythritol mixture and PVA, resulting reduced tensile strength and increased elongation-at-break. Zhou et al. (2009) prepared the PVA/starch composites using glycerol/urea mixture as plasticizer. They found the thermal processability of PVA was improved while the elastic modulus of the PVA decreased. Improving the comprehensive property of PVA without sacrificing its mechanical properties is a great challenge in academia and industry. In our previous work, PVA-based composites compounded with urea/caprolactam have been prepared with good processability as well as mechanical properties (Ni et al., 2017). The structure and mechanical properties of PVA-based composites have been systemically studied, while the mechanism of the modified PVA has not been carefully investigated. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is usually used in studying the stable conformational and thermodynamic properties of polymers, as well as predicting the mechanical properties of polymer-based composites. Hossain et al. (2010) worked out the deformation mechanisms of amorphous polyethylene during uniaxial tensile deformation by using the MD simulation. The chain lengths, elastic modulus, and mechanical testing for polyethylene were investigated. The results showed that the mechanical properties of polyethylene can be obtained by the MD simulation which were in good agreement with the experimental results. Raffaini et al. (2006) obtained the elastic properties of poly(vinyl alcohol) and poly(ethylene terephthalate) by atomistic simulations. The result showed that the simulated values corresponded to the theoretical upper limit of the mechanical properties, since it applied to ideal non-defective samples. Lu et al. (2017) investigated the thermal and mechanical properties of glycidyl azide polymer by the MD simulation. Results revealed that the introduction of −NO2 and −NH2 increased the toughness and strength properties of glycidyl azide polymer. Zheng et al. (2016) studied the mechanical properties of self-assembly tri-block copolymers by using the MD simulation. Results showed that the increase of the interaction strength in the glassy state polymer improved the stress-strain behavior and reduced the dynamic hysteresis loss. In this paper, the molecular mechanisms in compatibility and elasticity modulus of PVA/urea/caprolactam (PUC) composites were investigated by using MD simulation method. The mechanisms of the interaction between the urea/caprolactam and PVA matrix, as well as the evaluation of the elastic modulus were investigated. It provides theoretical predictions and basic understanding for the formulation of PVA-based composites."
1,Materials models and computational details,"Commercial software Materials Studio (MS) 6.0 was used to construct all the monomers and systems. All simulations were performed by a Gentai SP28HIEN workstation. The Condensed-phase Optimized Molecular Potentials for Atomistic Simulation Studies (COMPASS) forcefield was used in this study, in which most parameters were obtained by the ab initio data. The COMPASS forcefield enables accurate and simultaneous prediction for a broad range of molecules and macromolecules."
2,Molecular and single chain,"2.1 Molecular and single chain The structures of urea and caprolactam molecules were generated by the Visualizer module, and the PVA chain was constructed by a homo-polymer tool. Then, geometric optimization was performed to get the structures with minimum energy. Smart algorithm was used in the geometry optimization calculation, which was a cascade of the steepest descent, conjugate gradient, and the Newton-Raphson methods."
3,Amorphous cell packing,"2.2 Amorphous cell packing Setting reasonable length of the molecular chain is critical in MD simulation, because short chain length may lead to end effects, while the extremely long chain causes the increase of the simulation complexity. In this study, the number of atomic and the molecular weight in amorphous cells were kept consistent to ensure the simulation models effectively comparable. Five amorphous cells containing PVA chains with 53 chain lengths and different amount of urea/caprolactam were generated by the Amorphous Cell module. The initial density was set as 0.6 g/cm−3 to ensure the molecular chains have enough conformation space. Ten configurations were allowed to construct by using the method of Theodorou and Suter (1985). The position and orientation of the molecules in the amorphous cells were randomly assigned. Cubic periodic boundary conditions were used to make the density constant. When one particle in the system moves out from the unit cell, another particle moves in. Table 1 shows the composition and atomic number of the amorphous cells. The numbers 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 in the sample name stand for the weight ratio of the urea/caprolactam mixture in PVA-based composites. In order to gain the structures with minimum energy, geometric optimization was performed once again."
4,Annealing and further equilibration,"2.3 Annealing and further equilibration An anneal dynamics calculation was conducted to explore structure with low energy. The simulation temperature was periodically raised and decreased to avoid capturing local minimum energy conformation. NPT (constant-pressure, constant-temperature) dynamics procedure was used for the dynamics calculation at 1 × 105 Pa. Five annealing cycles were performed and the simulation time for each cycle was set as 100 ps. Considered the glass transition temperature of the molecules in the system, the initial and highest temperatures were set as 300 K and 400 K, respectively. Fig. 1 shows the time dependency of density of the PUC30 specimen during annealing and the unit cell structure change before and after annealing. NPT dynamic simulation for 200 ps was performed to gain a stable equilibrium density at 298 K. Finally, 50 ps NVT (canonical ensemble) dynamics was carried out on the equilibrium system. During the simulation, Andersen and Berendsen methods were used to control the temperature and pressure, respectively (Andersen, 1980; Berendsen et al., 1984). Ewald algorithm was used to determine the electrostatic forces and the van der Waals forces were calculated by the atom based algorithm. The common form of non-bond potential energy is Lennard-Jones potential energy, which could be expressed as, (1) U ( r ) = 4 ε [ ( σ r ) 12 − ( σ r ) 6 ] where r is the distance between the atom pairs, σ and ε are potential energy parameters. When the distance between two atoms is greater than r c, the value of potential energy approaches 0, indicating that non-bond forces can be ignored. r c is the cut-off radius. In this paper, long-range interaction was calculated using the cut-off radius of 11 Å to avoid repeating calculation of the particle forces. As PVA is a non-rigid polymer, the time step was set as 1 fs. Frames were recorded to the trajectory file every 250 time steps and the data in last 30 ps (160 frames) were used for analysis."
5,Evaluation of system balance and equilibrium structures,"2.4 Evaluation of system balance and equilibrium structures Energy, temperature, density, and radial distribution function are key factors to determine the equilibrium of the system (Hofmann et al., 2000; Zhang and Mattice, 1993). It showed that the simulation system reached equilibrium when the energy of the system was constant and the temperature reached set value in a stable status. Thus, all of the simulations in this study were based on equilibrium systems. Fig. 2 shows the time dependency of the temperature and energy curves of the PUC30 specimen. The equilibrium conformations of PVA-based composites with different weight ratio are shown in Fig. 3."
6,Sample preparation,"2.5 Sample preparation In order to verify the simulation results, PVA films with different weight ratio of plasticizers were prepared by solvent casting method for comparison. PVA was dried in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h to remove any excess moisture. PVA samples were dissolved in deionized water and stirred at 95 °C for 2 h until completely dissolved. Then, different amount of the urea and caprolactam were added to the PVA aqueous solution at 60 °C for half an hour. Finally, the solution was poured into a Petri dish and dried under vacuum condition at 60 °C to completely eliminate moisture. All specimens were equilibrated in a desiccator of 54% RH (conditioned by Ca(NO3)2 solution) at room temperature for a week."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Scanning electron microscopy analysis,"3.1 Scanning electron microscopy analysis To investigate the compatibility of modified PVA specimens compounded with urea and caprolactam, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of the cross-section of PVA and PVA-based samples were obtained by a SEM instrument (JSM-6610LV, Japan). Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show the SEM micrographs of the cross-section of PVA-based samples with different ratio of urea and caprolactam. Homogeneous phase for all of the samples was observed, indicating good compatibility between the urea/caprolactam and PVA matrix, when the content of urea/caprolactam is not more than 40 phr."
9,Elastic modulus,"3.2 Elastic modulus Static, dynamic, and fluctuation methods are usually used for calculating the mechanical properties of the samples in MD simulation (Masoumi et al., 2015). Static method was carried out in this paper to predict the elastic modulus of PVA and PVA-based composites. When calculating the elastic constant by using the static method, the change of entropy and the vibration motion of the atoms are neglected (Theodorou and Suter, 1986; Valavala et al., 2007). When the static method was used to calculate the mechanical properties at a certain temperature, a tiny strain should be applied to the balanced periodic structural model from three dimensional directions. Then the models were subjected to geometry optimization so that the system could be balanced again, and the new system energy value was obtained. This process repeated several times, and the rigid matrix of 6 × 6 mode of the crosslinking system was obtained by using two order derivative of the system energy versus strain. The stiffness matrix could be expressed as, (2) C i j = 1 V 0 ∂ 2 U ∂ ε i ∂ ε j where, C ij is the matrix element, U is the energy of the system, V 0 is the volume of the system, ε i is the stress, and ε j is the strain. For amorphous materials, assuming that the material is isotropic, the rigid matrix of the system is usually symmetrical, (3) ( λ + 2 μ λ λ 0 0 0 λ λ + 2 μ λ 0 0 0 λ λ λ + 2 μ 0 0 0 0 0 0 μ 0 0 0 0 0 0 μ 0 0 0 0 0 0 μ ) where, λ and μ are the Lamé constants and defined as, (4) λ = 1 3 ( C 11 + C 22 + C 33 ) − 2 3 ( C 44 + C 55 + C 66 ) (5) μ = 1 3 ( C 44 + C 55 + C 66 ) Then, the tensile modulus (E), bulk modulus (K), and shear modulus (G) could be calculated by the Lamé constant as, (6) E = μ ( 3 λ + 2 μ ) λ + μ , K = λ + 2 3 μ , G = μ The elastic moduli of PVA-based composites with different content of urea/caprolactam were obtained though analyzing the trajectories of equilibrium conformations at the temperature of 298 K. Fig. 6 shows the simulation results of the bulk modulus, shear modulus, and tensile modulus of the samples. It was observed that the elastic moduli of PVA-based composites decreased with the increasing of urea/caprolactam, indicating the addition of plasticizers reduced the stiffness of PVA. Tensile tests were performed at the room temperature with an electromechanical testing machine CMT4104 (MTS systems, China). At least five specimens were tested for each sample with a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min. Fig. 7 shows the tensile strength and tensile for the PVA samples with different content of urea/caprolactam. It is seen that the tensile strength and tensile modulus of the samples decreased with the increase of the urea/caprolactam content, which is consistent with the simulation results. It was found that the experimental values of the tensile modulus are significantly smaller than the simulation results. It is mainly because there are no defects in the simulated ideal sample. Besides, experimental errors are inevitable due to the environment, equipment, and other factors. Meanwhile, the inaccuracy of the COMPASS forcefield for non-bond interaction calculations may cause the higher results and this trend has been amplified after the superposition of periodic boundary conditions. Raffaini et al. (2006) also showed the magnitude difference between the experimental and simulated values of elastic modulus."
10,Intermolecular interaction energy,"3.3 Intermolecular interaction energy Intermolecular interaction forces include van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds are directly related to the elastic modulus of the materials. Materials with high intermolecular interaction energy usually show high elastic modulus. In COMPASS forcefield, the hydrogen bond is not available and included in the non-bonded interaction, so the intermolecular energy is composed of van der Waals and electrostatic energy. In MD simulation, the energy of each component in the system can be obtained from the equilibrium conformation. Ewald algorithm was used to determine the electrostatic forces, and the electrostatic energy could be calculated by the Ewald technique (Karasawa and Iii, 1989) as, (7) E Q = η 2 ∑ L , i , j q i q j erf c ( a ) a + 2 π Ω ∑ n ≠ 0 ( [ ∑ i q i cos ( h ⋅ r i ) ] 2 + [ ∑ i q i sin ( h ⋅ r i ) ] 2 ) exp ( − b 2 ) h 2 − η π ∑ i q i 2 where E Q is the electrostatic energy, q i is the charge of the atom i, the erf is the error function, η is the ratio of real space sum converted to the reciprocal space sum, r i and h are the basis vectors of atoms i and the reciprocal lattice vector, h is the length of h, Ω and n is the side length, volume and total atom number of the system, respectively. a, b and c are the factors related to basis vectors and η. Energy values of PVA component calculated by the MD simulation are listed in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, the intermolecular energy of PVA-based samples decreased with the increase of the urea/caprolactam content in the samples, indicating the decrease of intermolecular interaction forces in PVA-based samples. Besides, the electrostatic energy for each sample is much higher than van der Waals energy, which is demonstrated that electrostatic forces dominate the intermolecular interaction forces in PVA samples. Glass transition of the polymer is a transition between the glassy state and rubbery state. Fox and Flory (Williams et al., 1955) proposed a free-volume theory to explain the glass transition and the free volume of the polymer underwent a transition at T g. Wu (2010) investigated the aqueous PVA by MD simulation. Zhao et al. (2016) studied the effect of intermolecular physical cross-linking on the T g of PVA and polyacrylic acid composites films by MD simulation. They found that the T g which determined by the specific volume, which was consistent with the experimental values. Fig. 8 shows the specific volume (reciprocal of density) as the function of temperature for pure PVA and PVA-based samples. The significant change of the slope on each curve indicates the occurrence of the glass transition for each sample. It is seen that the T g of the samples decreased with the increase of the urea/caprolactam content, indicating an increase in the activity of the PVA segment, which is due to the reduction on the intermolecular interaction in PVA. The Fractional Free Volume (FFV) results of the PVA-based samples reflect the same tendency. The FFV was calculated by the “Connolly surface” method by the atom volume& surface tool, which could be expressed as following equation, (8) FFV = V free V total where, V free and V total are the free volume and the total volume of the system, respectively. As shown in Fig. 9, FFV of the samples increased with the increase of the urea/caprolactam content. When the weight ratio of UC in the PVA-based composites increased from 0% to 40%, FFV of the cell increased from 13.63% to 22.05%. As the increase of FFV, PVA-based composites formed a looser aggregation structure due to its weak intermolecular forces, and then led to a lower elastic modulus of the materials."
11,Analysis of the pair correlation function,"3.4 Analysis of the pair correlation function The pair correlation function (PCF) was used to further analyze the interaction between the components of the PVA-based composites. It can be interpreted as the ratio of the local density to the bulk density and an assessment of the probability from a reference particle to find a particle in a distance of r, which is calculated by the average of static relationship between every given pair of particles, A and B as, (9) g A - B ( r ) = ( n B 4 π r 2 d r ) / ( N B v ) where n B represents the number of B atom surrounding atom A at distance r, N B and v represents the total number of B atom in the system and the volume of the whole system, respectively. To explore the interaction mechanism of the particles in PVA-based composites, NVT dynamics of 50 ps was conducted on the equilibrium conformation of PUC30 to obtain its PCFs. PVA molecular chain consists of the carbon atoms and the hydrogen atoms on the carbon backbone, the hydrogen atoms and the oxygen atoms in hydroxyl groups (–OH). In this study, the hydrogen atoms on the carbon backbone, the oxygen atoms and the hydrogen atoms in hydroxyl groups were marked as HPVA1, O−OH, and HPVA2, respectively. Similarly, in the caprolactam molecules, Hcap1, Ocap, Ncap, Hcap2 represents hydrogen atoms attached to a carbon atom, oxygen atoms in the carbonyl groups (–C˭O), nitrogen atoms and hydrogen atoms on the amino groups (–NH2), respectively. In the urea molecules, oxygen atoms in the carbonyl groups, nitrogen atoms and hydrogen atoms in the amino groups are marked as Ourea, Nurea, and Hurea. Fig. 10, Fig. 11, Fig. 12, Fig. 13, and Fig. 14 show the PCFs of the polar functional groups and their surrounding hydrogen atoms in PUC samples. Typically, a peak with r values below 3.5 Å is mainly composed of chemical bonds or hydrogen bonds, and the peak with a r values above 3.5 Å is mainly composed of van der Waals force (Wei et al., 2015). The shape of the PCF peak shows the probability of forming a hydrogen bond. Besides, all the peak values in the range of hydrogen bond should be taken into account when analyzing the probability of forming hydrogen bonds. Fig. 10 shows the PCFs between O(-OH) atoms and surrounding hydrogen atoms in PUC30 sample. The highest peaks of the PCF of O(–OH) atoms and HPVA1 atoms, Hcap2 atoms, Hurea atoms appear at r = 2.1 Å, r = 1.9 Å and r = 2.0 Å, which are in the range of hydrogen bonding distance and indicating that hydroxyl oxygen atoms formed hydrogen bonds with the hydrogen atoms in the PVA molecular chain, the caprolactam molecules, and the urea molecules, respectively. Among them, there are there peaks on the PCF of O(–OH) atoms and HPVA1 atoms, which are located at r = 2.1 Å, r = 2.6 Å and r = 3.4 Å, respectively. This indicated that O(–OH) atoms could form hydrogen bonds with three nearby HPVA1 atoms. Meantime, it is obverted that there are three peaks appearing on the PCF of O(–OH) atoms and HPVA2 atoms at r = 1.0 Å, r = 1.7 Å and r = 3.4 Å, respectively. The sharp peak with a high value at 1.0 Å is a clear indication of the presence of chemical bonds in hydroxyl groups. The peaks at 1.7 Å and 3.4 Å shows that hydrogen bonds were formed between oxygen atoms and hydrogen atoms on different hydroxyl groups. A comparable flat curve is seen on the PCF of O(–OH) atoms and Hcap1 atoms, indicating van der Waals force is the main interaction force between them. It can be concluded that the probability order of O(–OH) atoms to form a hydrogen bond with surrounding hydrogen atoms is HPVA2 > H PVA1 > Hcap2 > Hurea > Hcap The PCFs of Ncap atoms and surrounding hydrogen atoms in PUC30 specimen are shown in Fig. 11. The peak of the PCFs between Ncap atoms and Hcap2 atoms at r = 1 Å was extremely high, demonstrating that chemical bond was formed between them. The highest peaks of the PCFs between Ncap atoms and Hcap1 atoms, HPVA2 atoms located at r = 2.1 Å and r = 3.3 Å, which indicated the intermolecular forces between them were hydrogen bond. Meanwhile, it is seen that multiple peaks appear in the PCF of Ncap atoms and Hcap1 atoms, which is due to the fact that the hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon atoms at different positions. The Hcap1 atoms at different positions exhibit different probability to form hydrogen bonds with Ncap atoms. There is no significant peak was observed between Ncap atoms and HPVA1 atoms, Hurea atoms in the range of hydrogen bond, indicating that van der Waals force is the main interaction force between them. Overall, the probability of forming hydrogen bonds in Ncap atoms and surrounding hydrogen atoms in PUC30 specimen is Hcap1 > HPVA2 > Hurea > HPVA1 > Hcap2. Fig. 12 shows the PCFs of Ocap atoms and surrounding hydrogen atoms in PUC30 specimen. It could be obtained by comparing the peak value of PCFs that the possibility order of Ocap atoms forming hydrogen bonds with surrounding hydrogen atoms is Hcap2 > Hcap1 > Hurea > HPVA2 > HPVA1. Most of the first peak of PCFs between Ocap atoms and the surrounding hydrogen atoms shows at 3.5 Å, which demonstrate that the hydrogen bond is the main interaction between the oxygen atoms in the caprolactam molecule and the surrounding hydrogen atoms. Since the Ocap and Hcap2 atoms are in the same molecule and close to each other, the first peak of the PCF between Ocap and Hcap2 atoms is very sharp. The PCFs of Ourea atoms and surrounding hydrogen atoms in PUC30 samples are shown in Fig. 13, which indicates that Ourea atoms tend to form hydrogen bonds with HPVA2 atoms and Hurea atoms. There are two peaks appearing on the PCF of Ourea and Hurea atoms at r = 2.5 Å and r = 3.2 Å, respectively, due to the fact that there are two hydrogen atoms in the amine group and each of them could form hydrogen bonds with the Ourea atoms. The peaks of the PCFs between Ourea and HPVA1, Hcap1, Hcap2 atoms are very weak, demonstrating that most of the interaction force between them is van der Waals force. Fig. 14 shows the PCFs of Nurea atoms and surrounding hydrogen atoms in PUC30 specimen. The first peak of the PCF of Nurea and Hurea atoms shows the chemical bond between them, and the other two peaks at r = 2.4 Å and r = 3.2 Å are in the hydrogen bond range. It shows that hydrogen atoms in the amino group could form hydrogen bonds with nitrogen atoms. The highest peaks of the PCFs between Nurea and HPVA2, Hcap1 atoms shows at r = 3.5 Å and r = 3.2 Å, indicating that hydrogen bond formed between them. There is no obvious peak appear in the PCF between Nurea and HPVA1, Hcap2 atoms, indicating only a small part of the interaction between them is hydrogen bond, while most are van der Waals force. Thus, Nurea atoms is more likely to form hydrogen bonds with Hurea atoms, the order of the hydrogen bond formation between Ourea and other hydrogen atoms is Hcap1 > HPVA2 > HPVA1 > Hcap2. Based on the above analysis, the functional groups in the composites system interacted with each other mainly rely on hydrogen bonding, in which most are formed with their own hydrogen atoms. The carbonyl group in the plasticizer is more likely to form hydrogen bonds with the hydrogen atoms in the PVA molecule rather than the amino group, and played a leading role in the destruction of the intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the PVA molecule. Compared with the carbonyl group in the urea molecule, the carbonyl group in the caprolactam molecule had a slightly lower probability of forming hydrogen bonds with the hydrogen atoms in PVA, however, it could form hydrogen bonds with hydrogen atoms in urea, which was consistent with the effect of caprolactam on improving the solubility of urea in PVA (Ni et al., 2017). In general, urea and caprolactam also formed a large number of hydrogen bonds with PVA molecules, which reduce the probability of hydrogen bonding between PVA molecules as well as the interaction between PVA molecules."
12,Conclusions,"The simulation model of PVA composites with different content of urea/caprolactam were constructed and calculated by the MD simulation. The SEM micrographs of cross-section of PVA films proved that the PVA matrix had a good compatibility with urea/caprolactam. The elastic modulus was calculated by the static method, showing that the bulk modulus, shear modulus and tensile modulus of PVA composites decreased with the increasing plasticizer content. This trend was consistent with the experimental results. In addition, the simulation of the intermolecular interaction energy values showed that intermolecular interaction forces in PVA-based samples decreased with the increase of the urea/caprolactam content. It was the direct reason of the decrease of elastic modulus. The changing trend of glass transition temperature and FFVs of the PVA-based composites with urea/caprolactam content also validated this conclusion from the side. The PCFs analysis showed that the interaction between polar functional groups and surrounding hydrogen atoms in PVA was hydrogen bonds. Urea and caprolactam destroyed the intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds of PVA, which was the fundamental reason for the decrease of elastic modulus."
