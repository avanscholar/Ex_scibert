0,Introduction,"Among other renewable energy sources, solar power exhibits a higher potential of becoming the energy source of the future [1]. Moreover, owing to the increasingly serious global energy and environmental problems, photocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting by simulating natural photosynthesis has been considered as a promising way to solve above problems over the past decades [2–5]. Photocatalytic water splitting can be regarded as an artificial photosynthesis, which needs water, light and catalyst [6,7]; and some researchers have found that oxides, nitrogen oxides or sulfides containing Ti, Ga, Nb and Ta show certain photolytic activity [8–12]. Among these catalysts, TiO2 has attracted more attention due to its non-toxic, cheap and easily available [13]. Nevertheless, because of the rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, the occurrence of reverse reaction of hydrogen and oxygen and the existence of high overpotential, leading to the efficiency of pure TiO2 photolysis of water for hydrogen evolution very low. In addition, pure TiO2 photocatalysts perform small specific surface area, which means fewer active sites and it is the case that commercial P25 powders present limited hydrogen evolution. In order to solve above problems, a variety of strategies have been reported to improve the catalytic activity in TiO2-based catalysts and the following methods are representative. Firstly, novel metal deposition; it is found that Pt, Au, Ag, Ru, Pd and other inert metals can improve the photocatalytic activity of titanium dioxide [14–18]. So far, the photocatalytic materials with metal Pt as cocatalyst exhibit the best hydrogen production activity [19,20]. Secondly, dye sensitization; the light absorption range of TiO2 system is mainly located in the ultraviolet region. It is a meaningful research to extend the light excitation wavelength and utilize the energy of long wavelength in solar light and dye sensitization of TiO2 materials is an effective way to improve it [21]. Thirdly, composite semiconductors; the fabrication of composite semiconductors is conducive to increase the active position and improve the kinetic conditions of photocatalytic reaction, which contributes to the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. In this way, due to the migration and separation of photogenerated carriers between semiconductors with different energy levels, the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs is reduced, leading to the optical response range of composite semiconductors improved [22]. Fourthly, ion doping; it mainly involves metal ions, nonmetallic ions and rare earth metal ions [23,24]. In this method, new charges are introduced into the lattice of TiO2 to change the energy band structure, which promotes the photocatalytic activity. Last but not least, immobilization of catalyst; in this scheme, TiO2 is usually fixed on a skeleton for convenient separation and recovery, including glass, silica gel, ceramics, metal oxides, etc [25,26]. In particular, some researches are focus on the band energy lowering either by doping of different dopants [27], or the effect of irradiation [28], or by studying the structural and photocatalytic behavior [29–31]. Although the above methods greatly improve the activity of TiO2 catalyst, the preparation process presents complex and high-cost, which is not conducive to wide application. The facile preparation of TiO2 materials with high catalytic activities, still urgent to be ameliorated. Herein, this work proposed a facile synthesis method to fabricate a TiO2@SiO2 porous core shell structure materials with a high specific surface area. Silica microspheres were prepared by one-step method with ultra-low cost atmospheric drying, which acted as an excellent skeleton. And TiO2@SiO2 composites were prepared by liquid phase deposition. It should be pointed that the whole process remains simple and green, showing great potential for industrialization. The obtained porous core shell materials indicate high specific surface area (over 400 ​m2/g) with high photocatalytic efficiency. Under optimized conditions, the H2 production rates are roughly 3 times higher than that of P25 powder."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Tetra butyl titanate (TBOT, C16H36O4Ti), formamide (CH3NO), anhydrous ethanol (EtOH, C2H5OH), Methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS, CH3Si(CH3O)3), tert-butanol(C4H10O), methanol (CH3OH), ethanedioic acid (H2C2O4), acetic acid (AC, CH3COOH), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), deuterium oxide (D2O) and P25 powders were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co. Ltd., China. The Ammonium hydroxide (NH3·H2O) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., China. All chemicals were analytical grade and used without further purification. Deionized water (H2O) is ultrapure water (18.2 ​MΩ. cm) treated by UHP ultra-pure water machine."
3,Experiment methods,"2.2 Experiment methods The TiO2@SiO2 porous core shell structure materials were prepared by a facile process, including the liquid phase deposition in SiO2 microsphere framework of TiO2 sol, drying and heat treatment. The SiO2 aerogels were synthesized by one step rapid synthesis, which was reported in our previous study [32]. In more details, firstly, a certain amount of methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS), 10 ​ml of deionized water and 10 ​ml of tert-butanoll were stirred and mixed; then 0.072 ​g of ethanedioic acid was added under vigorous stirring in the matrix. After stirring for 5 ​min, the mixed solution was transferred to 70 ​°C oven for 1 ​h and then cooled naturally with 0.8 ​ml of NH3·H2O of 10 ​M was added and SiO2 alcohol gel was obtained. After 21 ​h’ aging at 70 ​°C. The obtained SiO2 alcohol gel was dried in atmospheric drying; all the wet gels were dried at room temperature for 4 ​h, then at 70 ​°C for 6 ​h, and 100 ​°C for 2 ​h in air. And the samples with 6 ​ml, 8 ​ml and 10 ​ml of precursor (MTMS) were labeled as M6, M8 and M10 respectively. The TiO2 alcohol gel was synthesized by a two-pot method. First, a certain amount of TBOT and ethanol were stirred and mixed to obtain solution A. Then, a certain amount of deionized water, ethanol and acetic acid were stirred and mixed to obtain solution B, and solution B was dropped into solution A at a certain rate under vigorous stirring in the matrix. After stirring for 5 ​min, an appropriate amount of formamide was added. The molar ratio of TBOT, ethanol, H2O, acetic acid, and formamide was kept constant in a corresponding ratio of 1:20:6:5:0.85 (2.5 ​ml TBOT, 8.5 ​ml ethanol, 0.8 ​ml ​H2O, 2 ​ml acetic acid, 0.25 ​ml formamide). The prepared silica microspheres were immersed in TiO2 sol for 12 ​h in at 40 ​°C and then it was soaked in ethanol for 30 ​min at 40 ​°C. Then, the samples were dried in an oven at 70 ​°C. Similarly, the prepared samples were labeled as CS6, CS8, CS10 respectively according to the dosage of MTMS. The dried composites were heat treated at 450 ​°C (labeled as CS6–450, CS8–450, CS10–450 respectively), 500 ​°C (labeled as CS6–500, CS8–500, CS10–500 respectively) and 550 ​°C (labeled as CS6–550, CS8–550, CS10–550 respectively) for 2 ​h at a heating rate of 5 ​°C per minute and cooled in the air."
4,Materials characterization,"2.3 Materials characterization Morphology and Nanostructure: Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization of the aerogels was performed by a Hitachi SU 4800 (Japan) with a 10 ​kV accelerating voltage and an EDS line scan were performed on Tecnai G2 F20 ​S–TWIN, operated at 200 ​kV. A transmission electron microscope (TEM Hitachi HT 7700 Japan) was used to further test the nanostructure of the samples. Nitrogen Physisorption Measurements: Nitrogen sorption isotherms were measured at 77 ​K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer. The sample was degassed at 120 ​°C for 2 ​h before testing. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis from the amount of N2 absorbed at various relative vapor pressures (six points 0.05 <P/P0 ​< ​0.3, nitrogen molecular cross-sectional area ​= ​0.162 ​nm2) was used to determine the surface area. Spectroscopy Test: Chemical properties of porous materials were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR Bruker TENSOR II Germany). The absorption wavelength range of the samples is measured by UV–NIS–NIR spectrophotometer (UV–3600 Plus, Japan). The steady state was recorded on an instrument's fluorescence spectrometer (FLS1000, Edinburgh, England). X-ray diffraction (XRD): All samples were characterized by in a RIGAKU SMARTLAB diffractometer with a Cu–K radiation source. Data were collected in the range of 20–80° at a scan rate of 10° min−1. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS): Samples were measured by XPS (AXIS SUPRA, Shimadzu/Kratos, England) to study the surface oxidation state. Differential Thermal Analysis and Thermogravimetric Analysis (DTA-TGA): The thermal stability of the materials was detected by DTA-TGA analyzer. (NETZSCH STA449C, Germany). Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production: To investigate the photocatalytic activities of samples for hydrogen generation, methanol was used to sacrifice the holes. 10 ​mg of photocatalyst was added to 50 ​ml of methanol/H2O (25 ​vol% methanol). Each sample was sonicated to form a uniform suspension, followed by saturation with N2 to eliminate air. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions were carried out in a 100 ​ml Pyrex reactor attached to a closed gas-circulation glass system and an evacuation system (Beijing Ceaulight). The mixture of the catalyst was sonicated for 10 ​min to form a uniform suspension and then thoroughly degassed to remove air (anaerobic conditions). The reactor was exposed under a 300 ​W Xe arc lamp (CEL–HXF300) coupled with an ultraviolet irradiation to analyze the H2 production by using an online SP-7920 gas chromatograph (GC, TCD detector, 5 ​Å molecular sieve columns and argon carrier). The reaction mixture was constantly stirred (500 ​revolutions per minute (rpm)) and maintained at 10 ​°C by an external cooling system. The liquid after photocatalytic test was analyzed by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR, JEOL JNM-ECZ500R). 0.5 ​ml D2O used as deuterated reagent and 30 ​μl DMSO used as internal standard to mix with 0.5 ​ml liquid to be tested."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Synthesis of porous TiO2@SiO2 porous core shell structure,"3.1 Synthesis of porous TiO2@SiO2 porous core shell structure Porous TiO2@SiO2 were synthesized by a liquid deposition, which was a universal approach [33,34]. Fig. 1 presents the process of preparing porous core shell materials. Because of the previous research of our group, it is extremely convenient to obtain a silica microsphere by a one-step method. Besides, the TiO2 sol is easy to configure at room temperature as well in our previous studies [35] and the liquid deposition process takes place under mild conditions, which represents a convenient way to prepare functional materials. It should be noted that it is controllable to adjust the size of silica microspheres by a different amount of precursor. Specifically, the average size of sample M6, M8 and M10 is about 10 ​μm, 5 ​μm and 2.5 ​μm respectively (Fig. 2 ) and it indicates that the Oswald Ripening is more obvious at low concentration in this system. In more details, further increase of precursor will form the silica network structure rather than microsphere structure [32], which is not conducive to the deposition of TiO2. In addition, through DTA-TGA analysis of M10 sample, it presents a large weight loss between 400 and 600 ​°C shown in Fig. S1. Considering the crystallization temperature of TiO2, heat temperatures of samples were chosen in 450, 500 and 550 ​°C. Overall, the whole process is very simple and green and all the raw materials are easy to obtain."
7,Morphology of TiO2@SiO2 porous core shell structure obtained at different temperatures,"3.2 Morphology of TiO2@SiO2 porous core shell structure obtained at different temperatures The morphology of all samples can be intuitive observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In this study, samples treated at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 3 , the microporous morphology of TiO2@SiO2 porous core shell structure after treatment retain a typical microsphere feature. Moreover, for CS10 samples, the structure of the samples tends to more uniform with the increase of temperature. In addition, an important aspect of the approach reported here is that with the increase of heat treatment temperature, the crystallization characteristics of TiO2 layer on the surface become more obvious and it can be verified in the subsequent XRD test as well. As mentioned above, samples with different size controlled by the precursor perform distinctions after heat treatment shown in Figs. S2 and S3. In more details, the larger size of TiO2@SiO2 porous core shell structure, the worse the thermal stability. For example, CS6 and CS8 were partially broken during heat treatment as can see in SEM images and CS6 is more obvious. What makes the matter worse is that this phenomenon aggravates with the increase of temperature. In the microsphere structure of three sizes, CS10 shows the excellent heat treatment stability, which is conducive to the catalytic performance of the materials. Generally, the mixing of two different metal oxides helps to improve the performance of synthetic oxides, because they have different physical and chemical properties relative to individual components. It has been proved that TiO2@SiO2 showed higher catalytic activity than pure TiO2 [36,37]. In addition, silica microspheres in this work have been proved a good template in our previous studies; it can resist capillary tension during atmospheric drying, which distinguished from other silica skeletons. While, the breakage of the larger core-shell structure may be attributed to the surface structure damage caused by thermal stress during heat treatment in CS6 and CS8 samples after heat treatment. At the same time, it ulteriorly indicates the necessity of using silica microsphere as the core skeleton."
8,Chemical bond and optical absorption,"3.3 Chemical bond and optical absorption In this study, CS10 and M10 samples were examined by Fourier transform infrared (FT–IR) spectrometer (Fig. 4 (a)). Same as previous studies, M10 sample presents typical absorption bands of the inorganic silica materials and similar phenomenon occurred in the M6 and M8 samples (Fig. S4). In more details, peaks at 1274 ​cm−1 can be assigned to the Si–CH3 (with absorption peak range of 1500–1700 ​cm−1) and Si–C stretching at 769 ​cm−1 were obvious [38], which is due to the introduction of methyl group in the precursor. 1007 ​cm−1 corresponds to the vibration peak of Si–O–Si, which testifies that there is a condensation reaction hydrolyzed by MTMS. Furthermore, the characteristic bands at 2979 ​cm−1 were agree well with C–H group (2843–3000 ​cm−1) [39]. However, the prepared TiO2@SiO2 materials after heat treatment emerges different absorption peaks. As for sample of CS10–450, CS10–500 and CS10–550, the above absorption peaks of the sample weakened and even disappeared. Accordingly, the characteristic bands at 579 ​cm−1 and 440 ​cm−1 correspond to the vibration peak of Ti–O–Ti [40,41], which indicates that the TiO2 layer exists in the core-shell structure. There is no doubt that M6 with CS6 and M8 with CS8 present similar results presented in Fig. S4. In addition, as shown in Fig. 4(b), the light absorption spectra of CS6–CS10 with different temperature treatment were concentrated in the ultraviolet region; it is consistent with the characteristics of TiO2 photocatalytic materials [42]. In addition, band gap of all samples was determined by establishing the relation between hυ and (αhυ)2 [43]. The obtained data shown in Fig. S5 indicated that the band gap energy of 3.11 ​eV, 3.23 ​eV, 3.25 ​eV, 3.18 ​eV, 3.13 ​eV, 3.21 ​eV, 3.20 ​eV, 3.21 ​eV and 3.22 ​eV correspond to samples of CS6–450, CS6–500, CS6–550, CS8–450, CS8–500, CS8–550, CS10–450, CS10–500 and CS10–550, respectively. Although the band gap energy of the samples increases slightly with the increase of heat treatment temperature, there is little difference in the band gap energy of samples. In order to verify the distribution of core-shell structure, the samples were analyzed by EDS analysis. In Fig. 5 , Fig. S6 and S7, it can be seen clearly that TiO2 exists in the surface of the core-shell structure, while SiO2 act as the carrier framework. Further elemental analysis indicates that the mass fraction of titanium is about 10% in in three sizes of core shell structures, which provides a meaningful basis for the comparison of photocatalytic performance of three sizes samples. To study the surface oxidation state of the samples, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of CS10-500 was tested (Fig. S8). The peaks of Ti, Si, O and C can be obviously detected from the overall XPS survey spectrum and the corresponding results were listed in Table S1 [44–49]. It is confirmed that the Ti element on the surface of the material exists in the form of TiO2, which is beneficial to the catalytic efficiency of samples."
9,Crystal structures,"3.4 Crystal structures In order to understand the crystal structure of TiO2 on the surface of the core shell materials, the crystallization of TiO2@SiO2 porous core shell materials after heat treatment were characterized by XRD test. All crystalline peaks could be corresponded to well-crystalline anatase TiO2 (PDF#71–1168). Specifically, the broad diffraction peaks at 25°, 38°, 48°, 54°, 55°, 63°, 69°, 70°, and 75°, assigned to (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204), (116), (220), and (215) reflection planes, respectively as shown in Fig. 6 (a–c) [50]. The lattice structure of samples was further refined by Rietveld method and refined plots of all structures have been shown in Fig. 6(d) and S9. The results indicate that the anatase structure belongs to the I41/amd space group and its crystal structure model was embedded in graph. It is worth nothing that TiO2@SiO2 porous core shell materials present a gradual crystallization process (Fig. 6(a–c)), and its crystallization strength increases with heat treatment temperature, which was reflected in the peak intensity improvement of XRD results. In the high-resolution TEM images of CS10–550 sample shown in Fig. 7 (b–d). The observed spacing of lattice fringes is 0.35 ​nm, and the lattice fringes corresponds to (101) crystal plane of TiO2 according to the Bragg equation, which confirms that the crystallization process of anatase has been completed after heat treatment. And from Fig. 7(a) and (b), it can be seen little distinguish in the size of the core-shell structure in SEM and TEM test, which ensures the credibility of the analysis."
10,SSA and pore structure,"3.5 SSA and pore structure Porous TiO2@SiO2 core shell structure materials manufactured in this study possess large specific surface area (SSA) due to our self-made high stability of silica microspheres scaffold and textural properties of samples after heat treatment are listed in Table S2. It is clear that the prepared samples after heat treatment still retain an astonishing SSA (over 400 ​m2/g), which provides extensive active site. In addition, for CS6 samples, the SSA of the samples after heat treatment improved, which is attributed to the aging effect of in the crystallization process and it is consistent with the uniform microstructure in the SEM images mentioned above. Nevertheless, the porous structure will be collapsed by the heat treatment process in a higher temperature although high temperature promotes the crystallization of TiO2. So, in order to balance the effects of SSA and crystallization on material performance, we employed 450–550 ​°C heat treatment temperature in this research. On the whole, the obtained porous core shell materials after heat treatment with extraordinary SSA is vital beneficial to photocatalytic reaction. The Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method was applied to analyze the adsorption curve to study the pore size distribution more intuitively. As shown in Fig. 8 (a), after high temperature heat treatment, the CS10 samples shows hysteresis loop in 0.9–1.0 relative pressure range and rapid increase of adsorption capacity in 0–0.1 relative pressure range, which proves that the sample has mesoporous properties. Besides, a similar phenomenon occurred in CS6 and CS8 samples (Fig. S10) and from the pore size distribution curve of BJH in Fig. 8(b), it possesses a pore distribution over 2–15 ​nm with similar volume peaks around 3 ​nm, followed by an almost flat tail covering. It is worth noting that the most probable distribution values slightly increased compared with the sample before heat treatment. Besides, the pore volume decreases gradually with the increase of heat temperature, which is an inevitable shrinkage phenomenon in the crystallization process of TiO2 materials. Besides, the hierarchy factor (HF) increases after the heat treatment which indicates that the external surface area was enhanced and there was a significant reduction in the micropore volume [51]. And heat-treated samples present approximate HF."
11,Hydrogen evolution performance,"3.6 Hydrogen evolution performance With above merits, the prepared TiO2@SiO2 porous core shell materials possess a large SSA with anatase crystal structure in the surface. It is speculated a high catalytic performance for extensive catalytic active sites in TiO2@SiO2 core shell structure. With the same temperature of crystallinity, the different photocurrent densities may be resulted from the different sizes of the samples. It should be pointed that the SiO2 embedded in the shell not only function as barriers in preventing the charge transfer between the adjacent TiO2 nanocrystalline, but also produces many bulk defects on the grain boundary, leading to serious electron hole recombination. In addition, silica scaffolds used in this work based on previous studies present advantages over traditional materials [32]. It was expected that the TiO2@SiO2 core shell structure with the outstanding SSA may exhibit the best performance in the following photocatalytic activity measurements. The photocatalytic activity of the TiO2@SiO2 core shell materials was evaluated by monitoring photocatalytic production of hydrogen from water with methanol as sacrificial reagent under ultraviolet light at room temperature. In this work, to investigate the number of photocatalytic activities of samples for hydrogen generation, 5 ​mg, 10 ​mg and 15 ​mg of the catalyst were applied for comparison and the hydrogen production rate was similar (Fig. S11(a)); but 10 ​mg of the catalyst shows a slightly higher hydrogen production rate, which may be the best mixing ratio of the catalyst in the solution. So, 10 ​mg of photocatalyst was chosen. For comparison, we also tested the hydrogen yield of commercial P25 powder and the XRD test indicates the crystal contains a small amount of rutile phase (Fig. S11(b)), which has been proved not dominant in the catalytic process. As presented in Fig. 9 (a), with the same UV light irradiation, the hydrogen evolution activity of P25 is poor, which is in accordance with the reported results. In contrast, the activities of the as-prepared TiO2@SiO2 core shell materials photocatalytic systems are remarkably enhanced. These catalysts not only showed high hydrogen evolution activity, but also had negligible activity decrease over a period of 6 ​h. It should be pointed out that the optimal heat treatment temperature of microspheres with different sizes is different. For example, CS6–550 sample showed the best performance for the higher crystallization degree of anatase in the same group of three samples at different temperatures, while CS8–450 sample possess high hydrogen evolution for its high SSA. In more details, the hydrogen production rates of P25, CS6–550, CS8–450 and CS10–500 are 128.21, 315.15,320.74 and 410.61 ​μmol ​g−1 ​h−1, respectively. It is worth noting that the hydrogen production rate of the CS10–500 sample is roughly 3 times higher than that of P25, indicating the obvious difference in the photocatalytic H2 production activity among the samples. It is worth noting that methanol as sacrificial agent is beneficial to the hydrogen evolution of anatase TiO2 [52]. In order to confirm its function, a test without methanol in the system was applied shown in Fig. S12. The results show that the hydrogen production rate of the sample using methanol as sacrificial agent is obviously excellent than that without sacrificial agent. As is well known, photocatalytic materials possess a huge SSA and appropriate crystal size, supplying high density of photocatalytic active sites and minimizing the migration distance of photogenerated charges, thus reducing the possibility of electron–hole recombination [53,54], which is important index of improving photocatalytic activity. And as shown in Fig. S13, PL spectrum test was used to characterize the electron and hole transfer and separation rates of the samples, which shows a distinct surface trap-state emission band at 463 ​nm under an excitation wavelength of 430 ​nm. The CS10–500 sample presents the lowest PL diffraction peak intensity, which indicates that it has the highest photogenerated electron hole separation rate and the highest electron transfer rate among other samples. And it is consistent with the results of photocatalysis test. After six photocatalytic cycles (Fig. 9(b)), the photocatalytic property of CS10–500 sample has no obvious attenuation. Besides, there is no apparent change in the XRD patterns and XPS spectra (Fig. S14). These results fully demonstrate the excellent photostability of the TiO2@SiO2 core shell photocatalyst. An important part of this work is that materials used in the photocatalytic system keep green and cheap and none metal doping is carried out to increase the cost. This is the key to the wide utilization of materials. According to the results, the prepared TiO2@SiO2 core shell photocatalysts with extraordinary SSA in this work show the advantage of replacing commercial P25 powder in the future. It is also expected to function as the raw materials for the fabrication efficient photocatalytic materials."
12,Mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"3.7 Mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution The mechanism of the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution by TiO2@SiO2 core shell structure schematically represented in Fig. 9(c). It not only presents excellent specific surface area, but also has crystallized anatase structure after heat treatment. When the TiO2@SiO2 composites is irradiated with UV light, the TiO2 in a numerous exposed structural surface can absorb UV light to excite electrons located at the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB), with the generation of photoexcited electron–hole pairs and the following charge separation. The photoexcited holes quickly oxidize the hydroxyl anion to form hydroxyl radicals and then oxidize a methanol molecule to formaldehyde, which renders electrons free from the Coulomb attraction of the holes. The 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the liquid after photocatalytic test was analyzed (Fig. S15). The 13C signals were in agreement with aqueous formaldehyde solution of previous reports [55,56]. Methanol, DMSO and D2O in the liquids were detected by 1H spectrum without other peaks and none other gases except hydrogen were detected by GC. The reaction equations are as follows: (1) TiO2+2hυ→2e− + 2h+ The hole (h+) further reaction with the H2O to form H+. (2) h+ ​+ ​H2O → H+ ​+ ​OH• (3) CH3OH ​+ ​OH•→ CH2O ​+ ​H2O (4) 2e− ​+ ​2H+ → H2 With more active sites, the surface of the TiO2@SiO2 core shell structure is decomposed into H2. After heat treatment, TiO2@SiO2 core shell still maintains a well porous morphology and in the process of catalytic hydrogen evolution, which can produce electron hole pairs more efficiently under UV irradiation. In addition, H2O is easily adsorbed on the porous structure owing to its own adsorption. Simultaneously, the photogenerated electrons can be easily transferred and have enough reduction capacity to react with H2O to generate H2 on the surface of the porous materials."
13,Conclusion,"In summary, porous TiO2@SiO2 core shell structure materials with a high specific surface area was prepared in this study. Based on previous research, silica microspheres were prepared by one-step economic method with a normal temperature and pressure drying. And TiO2@SiO2 composite gel was prepared by a facile liquid phase deposition process. The whole process maintains simple and green, showing great potential for industrialization. The prepared TiO2@SiO2 core shell structure materials possess a high specific surface area (over 400 ​m2/g) with anatase structure. More importantly, it presents a high photocatalytic efficiency; under optimized conditions, the H2 production rates can reach up to 410.61 ​μmol ​g−1 ​h−1, which is much higher than that of the commercial P25 powders. By a facile method, it is expected to function as the raw materials for the fabrication efficient photocatalytic materials. This study confirms that the photocatalytic performance can be enhanced by improvement of active site area and provides some insights in convenient preparation of titania based photocatalysis."
