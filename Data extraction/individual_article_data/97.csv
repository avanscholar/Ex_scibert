0,Introduction,"Halloysite has the chemical formula Al4Si2O5(OH)4·nH2O and is a novel 1D natural clay nanotube material belonging to dioctahedral 1:1 clay mineral of the kaolin group (Cheng et al., 2010; Massaro et al., 2018; Moraes et al., 2017; Giuseppe et al., 2018). The unit structure of halloysite contains octahedral gibbsite Al (OH)3 and tetrahedral SiO4 sheets in the 1:1 layer (i.e., halloysite nanotubes) (Liu et al., 2014; Singh, 1996). The external surface is composed of siloxane (Si-O-Si) groups, whereas the internal surface consists of a gibbsite-like array of aluminol (Al-OH) groups, and Al-OH and Si-OH groups are found at the edges of the material (Cheng et al., 2010; Joussein et al., 2005; Yuan et al., 2015; Zahidah et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2016). Halloysite mainly presented a hollow tubular structure in the sub-nanometer range with an aspect ratio of ca. 20; the wall is constituted of 10–15 bilayers with a spacing of approximately 0.72 nm. It has a density of 2.53 g·cm3 (Massaro et al., 2018). The length of halloysite nanotubes ranges from 600 to 1000 nm, and the diameter of the nanotubes ranges from 15 to 100 nm. The larger diameter and length versus synthesized carbon nanotubes and a large number of -OH groups on the internal surfaces and the edge surfaces offer a unique possibility for chemical modification and physical adsorption. This is an excellent carrier to load with various chemical species with widespread applications in various fields including catalysts (Fu et al., 2014; Feng et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2018; Lucy-Caterine et al., 2020; Sadjadi et al., 2017; Samahe, 2020; Torres-Luna et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2017), drugs (Massaro et al., 2018), proteins (Zhai et al., 2010; Lvov et al., 2002), antibacterial agents (Mu et al., 2014), storage material (Jin et al., 2013; Sahiner and Sengel, 2017; Shchukin et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2018), pollutant treatment (Deng et al., 2019), and polymer composites (Lorenzo et al., 2020) In recent years, the increasing interest on biomass as a source of chemicals for fuels and chemical products has arisen due to the limited fossil fuel resources and the demand for new clean chemical processes (Salnikova et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2011). Furfural is one of the key derivatives obtained from renewable biomass for the production of different important fine chemicals (Hu et al., 2012; Smoláková et al., 2018); thus, the selective hydrogenation of furfural (FF) to furfuryl alcohol (FA) has attracted much attention. Furfuryl alcohol (FA) is widely used in the chemical industry including special resins, polymers, and coatings (O'Driscoll et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2019). There are currently two methods for preparing furfuryl alcohol through hydrogenation of furfural: gas-phase catalytic hydrogenation and liquid-phase catalytic hydrogenation (Zeitsch, 2000). The catalytic systems of liquid-phase hydrogenation are based on copper chromite systems, mono- (Pd, Pt, Ru, Ni, Cu, Mg, and Fe), and bimetals (PdNi, PdIr, PdRu, and PtSn) (Maderuelo-Solera et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019). However, the Pd catalytic system was usually considered to be an environmental pollutant due to its high toxicity to humans. The high cost of Pt and Ru limits their utility in various fields. In contrast, Ni, Co, and Cu have relatively good catalytic performance, low cost, and low toxicity. They are widely used in various reaction fields. However, there are few studies on the catalytic activities of the mono- or bimetals catalyst-loaded natural nanoclays for liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural. The large length and diameter of the nanotube structure and the large number of -OH groups on the surface could give the halloysite excellent adsorption and loading performance to decrease the cost of catalyst and improve the distribution of metal nanoparticles. Here, we demonstrate the use of halloysite nanotubes as a carrier and stabilizer. The nanotubes could act as a nanostructured matrix and govern the metal particles' growth. This can lead to the possibility of a mono- or bimetal-loaded nanoclay system for the conversion of organic products based on biomass."
1,Experimental,
2,Material,"2.1 Material The used halloysite (named Hal in this study) sample was obtained from Hebei Province in China, and its composition is as follows (wt%): SiO2 39.59, Al2O3 36.57, Fe2O3 1.15, MgO 0.18, CaO 0.34, Na2O 0.86, and K2O 0.76. The specific surface area of raw Hal was 46.52 m2/g. The nitric acid (HNO3), tetraethylammonium hydroxide (C8H21NO), sodium borohydride (NaBH4), tetrahydrofuran (THF), furfuryl alcohol, and furfural were all obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., and used without purification. The deionized water was laboratory made (18.2 MΩ·cm)."
3,The treatment of halloysite,"2.2 The treatment of halloysite The raw Hal was dispersed in water at 25% and stirred for 30 min. The Hal suspension was then obtained using a siphon method for removing the decomposition. The obtained suspension was mixed with different concentrations of HNO3 or C8H21NO solution for generating more active sites and defects exposed on the external surface of tubes, and thus increasing the specific surface area of treated Hal samples. The concentrations of HNO3 solution were chosen as 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%; the concentrations of C8H21NO solution were chosen as 2%, 4%, 6%, and 8%. The samples were named Hal, Hal-NA, and Hal-TH. The Hal-NA sample was used as a carrier for evaluating the catalyst performance."
4,Synthesis of catalysts,"2.3 Synthesis of catalysts A series of Ni, CoO-supported Hal catalysts were synthesized via a deposition method. In a typical experiment, 1 g of pretreated and dried powder (d 50 = 1.15 μm, the percent of particle size lower than 1.15 μm is 50%) of Hal was impregnated with 2 mL of the NiNO3 solution (0.34 mol/L). The mixture was magnetically stirred for 5 h at room temperature and then held for 120 min at 60 °C for ions to become supported on the surface of the halloysite. Next, 10 mL of NaBH4 solution (1.08 mol/L) was added into the prepared mixture on an ice bath with pH from 10 to 11 and stirred for 30 min. The final mixture was then washed with water and absolute ethyl alcohol several times and dried in a vacuum at 105 °C until it reached a constant weight. The Ni- or Co-supported halloysite nanotube catalyst was obtained through calcination and hydrogen reduction in the tube furnace. The schematic representation of the preparation of Ni or CoO-(Hal-NA) catalysts is exhibited in Fig. S1."
5,Evaluation of catalyst,"2.4 Evaluation of catalyst Hydrogenation of furfural was performed in a steel batch reactor of the multiple reactor system. The furfural, prepared catalyst, and THF were introduced into the reactor in sequence. The reactor was purged with nitrogen several times. After the reactor was heated to an experimental operating temperature, hydrogen was supplied until it reached a setting pressure. In a typical experiment, 0.25 g of catalyst and 1 g furfural were added into 10 mL THF in the reactor, and then hydrogen was injected into the reactor until it reached a pressure of 2 MPa. The reaction was operated at the reaction temperature (120 °C) and pressure (2.0 MPa) under stirring (1000 rpm). The concentrations of the reaction mixture components were calculated using the internal standard calibration method. Furfural (starting substrate) and the main products were identified. Furfural conversion and furfuryl alcohol (FA) selectivity were calculated using the following formulas: (1) Conversion , % = n FF 0 − n FF i n FF 0 (2) Selectivity , % = n FA n FF 0 − n FF i where n FF 0- initial moles of furfural, n FF i - the moles of furfural in sample, n FA - the moles of furfural alcohol."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization The Ni content of the catalysts was determined by ICP-MS using a PerkinElmer Elan 9000 ICP Mass Spectrometer. The samples were digested in a microwave digester using concentrated HNO3 acid prior to analysis. The X-ray diffraction patterns of halloysite and treated halloysite samples were obtained using a Rigaku D/MAX 2500PC powder X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54059 Å) operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The scanning rate is 4° min−1 ranged from 2.6° to 60°. Low-temperature nitrogen adsorption was carried out on a surface analyzer BEISHIDE INSTRUMENT 3H-2000PS2 to obtain the specific surface area and porosity of acid-treated halloysite samples. Before the analysis, the halloysite samples were degassed at 200 °C in vacuum for 1 h using the device for the preliminary preparation of the samples. The BET adsorption isothermal equation and the relative mathematical calculation of the specific surface and the pore size distribution were as follows: (3) p v p o − p = 1 v m C + C − 1 v m C • p p o (4) S g = A m × N A × V m 22414 × 10 ‐ 18 m 2 / g The FT-IR spectrum of the halloysite and the prepared catalyst was recorded using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Magna-IR 750 Nicolet) at a resolution of 4 cm−1 from 4000 to 400 cm−1. The number of scans accumulated was thirty-two. The samples were prepared with potassium bromide (KBr) pellets (ca. 2% by mass in KBr). Scanning electron micrograph images of the halloysite and the prepared catalyst were observed by a cold field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, S-4800, Hitachi). During the observation, an accelerating voltage of 15 kV was selected, and the resolution was of ±2 nm. Transmission electron micrograph images of the halloysite and the prepared catalyst were acquired at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV on a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 field emission transmission electron microscope. A drop of a sample suspension was placed on a carbon-coated Cu grid. X-ray photoelectron spectra of the prepared catalysts were obtained using a Thermo-Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al X-ray source (1486.6 eV). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were calibrated by referring the adventitious carbon with 284.8 eV of C1s core level. The samples were allowed to outgas for 180 min before the analysis and were stable during the examination. The data analysis was performed by XPS Peak. The probes of the reaction mixture were periodically taken and analyzed with GC–MS (Shimadzu GC-2014CATF) equipped with a capillary column HP-1MS (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,The activation treatment of halloysite surface,"3.1 The activation treatment of halloysite surface The HNO3 and C8H21NO were chosen to activate the active site on external surfaces and thus increase the specific surface area and active defect sites on the external surface of Hal. The N2 adsorption and desorption curves of halloysite are presented in Fig. S2. The N2 adsorption and desorption curves of halloysite treated by HNO3 (A) and C8H21NO (B) are shown in Fig. 1 . Fig. S2 and Fig. 1 show that the N2 adsorption and desorption curves of Hal treated with different contents of HNO3 and C8H21NO presented a similar tendency and were a typical type IV according to the classification of adsorption and desorption curves (Zhang et al., 2017). The specific surface areas and average pore sizes of Hal samples treated by HNO3 (A) and C8H21NO (B) are presented in Tables 1 and 2 . The average pore size of treated samples ranged from 20 nm to 32 nm, and thus were mesoporous according to the classification of IUPAC (Fujiwara et al., 2002). Meanwhile, the distribution of pore volume approximately at 20–30 nm obviously increased after treatment. The specific surface areas of Hal increased as the content increased; it reached a maximum of 125.55 m2/g for HNO3 at 20% and 101.42 m2/g for C8H21NO at the content of 4%. These were attributed to the reaction between treatment agent and octahedral gibbsite Al (OH)3. However, the specific surface areas decreased when the content of HNO3 and C8H21NO continue to increase due to the collapse of the tubular structure. The SEM and TEM images of Hal, Hal-NA (with NA concentration of 20%), and Hal-TH (with TH concentration of 4%) are displayed in Fig. S3. Fig. S3 shows that the raw Hal had a typical hollow nanotube structure with a length of 200–1000 nm and a diameter of 20–40 nm. After treating with HNO3 and C8H21NO, the Hal still maintained a tubular structure. However, many pores or flaws were observed on the external surface of Hal tubular due to the reaction of treatment agents. This morphology indicated that more active sites were generated, which agrees with the BET data. The XRD and FT-IR patterns of Hal, Hal-NA (with a concentration of 20%), and Hal-TH (with a concentration of 4%) are exhibited in Fig. 2 . As illustrated in the XRD patterns of raw Hal, the two diffraction peaks with values of 0.998 nm and 0.734 nm observed at 2θ = 8.84° and 12.02° were attributed to 10 Å halloysite (001) and 7 Å halloysite (001), respectively (Cheng et al., 2010; Cheng et al., 2011; Li et al., 2017b). Meanwhile, the diffraction peaks of d (020), d (110), and d (002) of the 7 Å halloysite were presented at 2θ = 18.08°, 19.95°, and 24.84° with values of 0.489 nm, 0.445 nm, and 0.357 nm, respectively (Li et al., 2017a). However, the characteristic diffraction of 10 Å halloysite (001) at 2θ = 8.84° disappeared when Hal was treated by HNO3 and C8H21NO due to the removal of water molecules in the interlayers; thus, the relative intensity of characteristic diffraction d (001) for 7 Å halloysite increased significantly. In the FT-IR spectrum, two bands were observed at 3696 cm−1 and 3620 cm−1 and attributed to the symmetrical in-phase vibration of surface hydroxyl and the stretching vibration modes of inner hydroxyl, respectively. Correspondingly, the band at 910 cm−1 was assigned to the bending vibration of Al-OH. The relative intensities of the stretching vibration bands for inner hydroxyl groups showed a slight increase after Hal treatment. This may be attributed to the reaction of treated agents. The stretching vibration modes for SiO at. 1094 cm−1 and 1029 cm−1 showed a subtle change."
9,"The characterization of Ni, CoO-supported halloysite nanotube catalyst","3.2 The characterization of Ni, CoO-supported halloysite nanotube catalyst In order to understand the influence of reaction conditions and surface properties of Hal on the loading of metals ion on the surface of Hal nanotubes, a series of catalysts were prepared under different reaction conditions. The products were used to evaluate the loading contents, morphology, and valence state of metal ions. The results are shown in Fig. S4. According to Fig. S4, the Ni content of Hal-NA (with a concentration of 20%) was 6.64% and 6.56% in the water and absolute ethanol solvents systems, respectively. These values were better than those of Hal-TH. The phenomenon may be attributed to increase in active defect sites of hydroxyl of Hal-NA than Hal-TH. Meanwhile, the exchange capacity and exchange ratio had a similar tendency. The effect of concentration on the Ni loading content on Hal-NA is displayed in Fig. S4c. The Ni loading content increased with increasing concentration of nickel nitrate solution. The Ni loading content reached a maximum value of 6.54% when the nickel nitrate solution concentration was 0.34 mol/L; however, this value decreased significantly with an increase in the concentration of nickel nitrate. This phenomenon may be attributed to the aggregation of metal particles and desorption from the surface of Hal (Wang et al., 1995). This result indicated that the degree of ion exchange was restricted under high concentrations due to the pore of Hal. The ion exchange capacity and ratio gradually increased and reached a maximum before 300 min. These values slightly decreased when the reaction time was further extended from 300 min to 480 min. The bimetals ions (Ni, CoO) presented a similar loading content results to that of mon-metal. According to the XRD patterns of the prepared catalysts shown in Fig. 3 , the characteristic diffraction signals observed at 2θ values of 44.5° (111) and 51.8° (200) of Ni-(Hal-NA) sample indicated the presence of elemental Ni metal particles on the surface of (Hal-NA) nanotubes with weaker characteristic diffractions of Hal. For CoO-(Hal-NA) sample, the diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 36.5° (111), 42.4° (200), and 64.5° (220) indicated the successful loading on the surface of Hal nanotubes with CoO. The XRD patterns for metal Ni and CoO-(Hal-NA) samples displayed characteristic diffraction peaks of elemental Ni metal and CoO. This confirmed the successful loading of metal Ni and CoO on the surface of Hal-NA nanotubes. The TEM images in Fig. S5 shows that the elemental Ni metal particles were adsorbed on the external surfaces and lumen of Hal nanotubes with diameters of approximately 10 nm. There are no obvious agglomerates on the surface of Hal nanotubes. Meanwhile, the CoO particles were obviously observed on the external surfaces and lumen of Hal nanotubes, but a few particle agglomerates were seen in some regions of Hal nanotubes. The XPS spectrum of Ni-(Hal-NA) sample is divided into two components (Fig. 4a): The binding energy of 852.9 eV was assigned to Ni° (Ermakova and Ermakov, 2002; Hosseini et al., 2012). The peaks at 870.32 eV, 874.1 eV, and 881.7 eV for Ni 2p1 appear in Ni 2p profile. However, the binding energies of 856.2 eV indicated the existence of NiO, which is attributed to the weak oxidation on the surface of metal Ni loaded on the Hal during the XPS sample preparation. The CoO-Hal spectrum is also deconvoluted into two components (Fig. 4b): The Co 2p binding energies of 780.67 eV and 796.58 eV were attributed to Co2+ (54.3%) and Co3+ (45.7%), respectively. Both of these were observed suggesting that the Co metal had CoO and Co3O4 (Shen and Chen, 2007; Wang et al., 1995). The XPS spectrum of metal Ni and CoO presented obvious banding energies of 852.9 eV for Ni°, and 781.04 eV and 797.34 eV for Co2+ (47.8%) and Co3+ (52.2%), respectively. The increasing binding energy and increase in Co3+ proportion for Co 2p indicated electron deletion for metal Co and electron transformation to Ni. These values are attributed to the higher electronegativity and better ability to attract Ni electrons than Co. This observation agrees with the binding energy change for Ni 2p."
10,"The evaluation of Ni, CoO-supported halloysite nanotube catalyst","3.3 The evaluation of Ni, CoO-supported halloysite nanotube catalyst The catalytic performance of the Ni, CoO-(Hal-NA) sample was studied in the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. Optimal conditions of furfural hydrogenation were investigated, and the results of catalytic testing of Ni, CoO-(Hal-NA) sample are presented in Fig. S6. Fig. S6a compares different types of catalysts in furfural conversion and selectivity to furfural alcohol. There was high conversion for furfural (66.4%) over the observed reaction period with Ni-(Hal-NA). There were lower values (34.2% and 48.4%) for the Co-(Hal-NA) catalyst and Ni, CoO-(Hal-NA) (1:1) catalyst. Meanwhile, the selectivity to furfural alcohol for the Ni-(Hal-NA) catalyst was 96.4%, which presented higher values than CoO-(Hal-NA) (49.9%). The Ni-(Hal-NA) catalyst showed better performance of FF conversion and selectivity to furfural alcohol, which was attributed to the higher electronegativity and the ability to attract Ni electrons. The dependence of the conversion of furfural on temperature for Ni-(Hal-NA) catalyst is shown in Fig. S6b. The furfural conversion and selectivity to furfural alcohol gradually increased with increasing temperature and reached a maximum of 60.7% and 99.0% at 120 °C, respectively. At 130 °C, the furfural conversion and selectivity to furfural alcohol gradually decreased to 55.9% and 91.3%, respectively. This may be due to the presence of side reactions with an increase in temperature. This decreases the yield of furfuryl alcohol. By increasing the reaction time, the conversion of furfural increased significantly from 22.3% to 62.4% (Fig. S6c); thus, the selectivity to furfural alcohol increased from 61.4% to 96.8% when the reaction time was 10 h. The furfural conversion rate decreased with longer times. This was attributed to the presence of side reactions that decreased the furfural conversion rate. The conversion of furfural and selectivity to furfural alcohol was 68.4% and 98.3%, respectively, when the content of the prepared catalyst was 0.25% (Fig. S6d). The selectivity to furfural alcohol remained stable as the content increased, but the conversion of furfural decreased and plateaued at 54%. The optimal condition of reaction pressure was chosen at 2 MPa, and the furfural conversion and selectivity to furfural alcohol gradually reached 64.6% and 96.4%, respectively. To evaluate the prepared Ni-(Hal-NA) catalyst stability in the repeated use, five successive cyclic experiments of the furfural hydrogenation were carried out under optimal conditions. The characterization of raw catalyst and used catalyst is shown. Fig. S6f indicates that the Ni-(Hal-NA) catalyst is stable; furfural conversion and selectivity for furfural alcohol remained at approximately 96% and 65%, respectively, after five catalytic cycles. This suggests stability of ion concentration and state on the surface of the Hal nanotubes. Meanwhile, the Ni contents in Ni-(Hal-NA) catalyst presented a subtle change after five catalytic cycles (approximately 6.5%) (Table 3 ). Fig. 5 shows XRD data for raw Ni-(Hal-NA) and the catalyst after five rounds of use (Fig. 5). The crystal structure had only subtle changes after five cycles. The characteristic peak positions for Ni at 2θ values of 44.5° (111) and 51.8° (200) exhibited no change, but relative peak intensities decreased. The TEM images of Ni-(Hal-NA) catalyst used after five catalytic cycles are shown in Fig. 6 . The elemental Ni metal particles adsorbed on the surface of Hal nanotubes were well discriminated with no obvious aggregates. This agrees with the data above."
