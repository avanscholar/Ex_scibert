0,Introduction,"The growing demand for energy in today's world has been met with a massive exploitation of fossil fuels which resulted in the increase of pollutants emission. This state of affairs requires the development of alternative and environmentally friendly energy sources [1,2]. Hydrogen is considered as an ideal fuel for the future that can be produced from clean and renewable energy sources such as biomass and water. Biomass is the most versatile renewable resource, and can be utilized for the sustainable production of hydrogen [3,4]. A several processes have been developed for this purpose (e.g., steam gasification [5], fast pyrolysis [4,6], steam reforming etc [7,8]). However, these processes require rigorous conditions, such as high temperature, and high pressure therefore are of high cost. Compared to these thermal processes, photocatalytic reforming is an alternative process that can be carried out at ambient conditions using sunlight. The photocatalytic water splitting in recent years has been extended to use the organic/inorganic pollutants and biomass derived compounds as sacrificial agents for hydrogen production [9–16]. The photocatalytic production of hydrogen over semiconductor metal oxides is a promising way to convert solar energy into chemical energy. Different semiconductors, consisting of complex mixed metal oxides, have been proposed as photocatalysts for these reactions recently [17–20]. TiO2 has been widely used as a photocatalyst, because of its favorable band-gap energy, low cost, non-toxicity and its high chemical and photo stability. However, the efficiency of TiO2 is limited to UV range and also by the high recombination rate of photoinduced electron–hole pairs formed in photocatalytic processes. Attempts have been made to improve the photocatalytic H2 production of TiO2, by depositing noble metals [21]. Titanium dioxide modified by noble metal deposition has been widely proved to be one of the best systems for hydrogen production; mainly for its ability to enhance electron–holes pair separation and photoinduced reduction processes [22]. This is mainly because the Fermi level of the noble metal is lower in energy than the conduction band of TiO2. The photo promoted electrons can efficiently migrate to the metal, leaving the holes in the TiO2 valence band [23]. The rate of photocatalytic hydrogen production further increases in the presence of organic compounds, wherein the organic compounds scavenge the valence band holes and undergo rapid and irreversible oxidation. Photocatalytic H2 production rate is improved on doping transition-metal ions and non-metals [24]. Various transition metals like Fe, Cu, Ni, Cr and Co etc have been successfully doped on TiO2 to promote the photocatalytic activity and to minimize the electron hole recombination and charge transfer at interface. Among these, cobalt doped TiO2 was studied in various applications like oxidation of NO and CO [25,26], degradation of the methylene blue [27], methyl orange [28], 2-chlorophenol [29] 4-chlorophenol [30], oxidation of cyclohexane [31] and hydrogen production [32,33]. Earlier investigations from this laboratory, detailed UV sensitive materials like nano-crystalline natrotantite, Ce supported zeolites and visible sensitive Ag x O, Cu2O doped TiO2 photocatalysts for hydrogen production form water and alcohol water mixtures [34–37]. In the present course of investigation, cobalt doped TiO2 photocatalysts are used for H2 production from aqueous glycerol solutions. The effect of the reaction parameters such as cobalt wt% on TiO2, glycerol concentration, different substrates (alcohols) and pH of the solution on the hydrogen evolution activity are investigated in detail. The objective is to develop an efficient photocatalyst and to optimize the photocatalytic conditions for hydrogen production from glycerol: water mixtures."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals TiO2 P-25 (anatase-80%, rutile-20%, surface area 50 m2/g and particle size 27 nm) is from Deggussa Corporation, Germany, Co (CH3COO)2.4H2O is from Sigma–Aldrich, and Glycerol is from Qualigens Fine Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. (India). Methanol, Ethanol, Ethylene glycol and Isopropanol are from Rankem Ltd. (India). NaOH is from SD Fine – Chem Limited (India), and HNO3 is from Merck Specialties Pvt. Ltd. (India)."
3,Catalysts preparation,"2.2 Catalysts preparation Cobalt (0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 5 wt%) was doped on TiO2 by impregnation method. For each cobalt modified TiO2 sample, TiO2 was added to the known amount of Co (CH3COO)2·4H2O solution in distilled water. Excess water was evaporated to dryness under constant stirring with slow heating. The dried powder was calcined at 400 °C/5 h. The catalysts with 0, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 5 (wt%) of cobalt doped TiO2 are labeled as 0CT, 0.2CT, 0.5CT, 1CT, 2CT, 3CT and 5CT. Catalyst with 1 wt% cobalt doped on TiO2 was reduced using 30% H2/N2 gas at 450 °C/5 h. Cobalt doped TiO2 catalyst (1 wt%) used in Solar and UV light and reduced, are labeled as 1CTS, 1CTU and 1CTR & subjected to characterization. Characteristics of reduced and used catalysts under solar and UV are studied to understand the changes in the chemical environment of Co (II) during the photocatalytic reaction."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the TiO2 and Co modified TiO2 catalysts were recorded with Siemens D-5000 X-ray diffractometer using Ni filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5409 Å) from 2θ = 5–80°. The UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a GBC UV–Visible Cintra 10e spectrometer, in the wavelength range of 200–800 nm. Elemental analysis was carried out using Link, ISIS-300, Oxford, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX) detector. A Philips Technai G2 FEI F12 transmission electron microscope operating at 80–100 kV was used to record the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) patterns. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a KRATOS AXIC 165 equipped with Mg Kα radiation. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded on a Jeol JES-FA200 EPR spectrometer at room temperature."
5,Catalytic activity,"2.4 Catalytic activity Photocatalytic reactions were carried out under solar and UV light (400 W Hg vapor lamp) irradiation. The intensity of solar light was measured using a LT Lutron LX-101A digital light meter. The solar light intensity was measured for every hour between 10:00 and 15:00 h. The average light intensity value observed was around 1,30,000 Lx during the experiments. The reaction was performed in 150 mL quartz reactor by taking of 50 mL distilled water containing 100 mg of catalyst. Reactions were also carried out in 5% (v/v) glycerol: water mixtures. Prior to the irradiation, the reaction mixture was evacuated for 30 min and purged with nitrogen gas for 30 min to remove the dissolved oxygen. After irradiation, the evolved gases were analyzed at every 1 h by a gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2014) using molecular sieve 5A column & thermal conductivity detector and N2 as a carrier gas. CO2 was analyzed using Corbaxen-1000 column. Fig. 1 shows the experimental set-up under solar light irradiation."
6,Results and discussion,
7,XRD,"3.1 XRD XRD of cobalt doped TiO2 catalysts is studied to understand the dispersion of cobalt on surface of TiO2 and to make a note of TiO2 phases in the calcined catalysts. Fig. 2 shows the X-Ray diffraction patterns of the undoped and cobalt doped TiO2 samples. The XRD patterns clearly show the characteristic planes of anatase phase at 2θ = 25.5° (101), 48° (200), and rutile phase at 2θ = 27.4° (110). The XRD pattern does not show any cobalt phase (even for 5CT sample), indicating that cobalt ions are uniformly dispersed on the TiO2 support. In the region of 2θ = 5–80°, the shape of diffractive peaks of undoped TiO2 (0CT) is quite similar to that of cobalt doped TiO2."
8,EDAX,"3.2 EDAX EDAX analysis of fresh and used samples was carried out to determine cobalt content on the surface of TiO2, and the data obtained is shown in Table 1 . In the used catalysts no loss of Co under solar irradiation (for 1CT catalyst, 1.01–0.98), and about 25% Co loss is observed on 1CT catalyst under UV irradiation. The observed loss is possibly seen as due to the dissolution of Co ions into the solution by the acidic conditions formed during the reaction."
9,DRS,"3.3 DRS DRS studies help to understand the band gaps of the material at pre and post evolution conditions. The band gaps will change during the photo reaction as the catalysts are exposed to photons of different energies. The chemistry involved can be highlighted by these changes. The diffused reflectance spectra of undoped and cobalt doped TiO2 samples are shown in Fig. 3 A. The DRS spectrum of TiO2 consists of a broad intense absorption around 384 nm (corresponding to band gap energy of 3.2 eV calculated from the formula λ = 1239.8/E bg) due to the charge-transfer from the valence band formed by 2p orbitals of the oxide anions to the conduction band formed by 3d t2g orbitals of the Ti4+ cations [34,35]. DRS spectra of cobalt doped TiO2 showed a red shift in the absorption value. Increase in the concentration of cobalt ions on TiO2 resulted in a prominent change or shift of band edge from UV to visible region (3.2–2.70 eV) is shown in Table 1 [27]. The DRS spectra of the cobalt doped TiO2 catalysts consist of one additional absorption peak around 550 nm. With the gradual increase of Co2+ concentration on TiO2, the sharpness and intensity of absorption band between 500 and 650 nm is also increased gradually [27]. The genesis of absorption peak that is increasing with Co concentration in TiO2 is attributed to Co2+ → Ti4+ Charge–Transfer interaction. This may also be a reason for high photo activity of these materials in the visible region. The DRS of 1CT calcined, used (under solar, UV) and reduced catalysts are compared and shown in Fig. 3B. The band gap energy of 1CT calcined catalyst is slightly higher than used and reduced catalysts (Table 1). Under solar light irradiation, 1CT catalyst band gap energy value decreased from 2.9 to 2.80 eV in 35 h course of the reaction (1CTS). Under UV light irradiation, 1CT catalyst band gap energy value decreased from 2.9 to 2.67 eV in 35 h reaction (1CTU). Co2+ → Ti4+ Charge–Transfer interaction disappeared in 1CTU and 1CTR catalysts due to the reduction of Co2+ to Co."
10,TEM,"3.4 TEM As the XRD do not reveal the particle size at low loadings and SEM range do not show the fine dispersion. TEM studies are needed to understand the above parameters. TEM photographs of 1CT catalysts calcined and used under solar and UV light are shown in Fig. 4 . In general the TiO2 particles appear transparent and also dense when the particles are in layers. The impregnated cobalt particles are of very fine size and seen as dark patches on the surface of transparent TiO2 particles. The used catalyst (1CTS) also shows the same type of cobalt particles on the surface of TiO2 even after 35 h reaction under solar light irradiation. TEM image of 1CT catalyst used under UV light irradiation shows less number of cobalt dark patches on TiO2 surface, due to the dissolution leaching of metal ion into the solution, and this is also supported by the decrease in Co concentration studied by EDAX as shown in Table 1."
11,XPS,"3.5 XPS As the doping is mainly taking place on the surface any change in the surface environment at pre and post reaction condition is elucidated by XPS studies. XPS spectra of Ti 2p, Co 2p and O1s of different cobalt doped TiO2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 5 A–C. The Ti 2p spectrum of TiO2 shows characteristic peaks of Ti 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 at 458.5 eV and 464.2 eV with a ΔE = Ti 2p3/2 − 2p1/2 of 5.7 eV, confirming oxidation state of +4 for titanium [36]. In cobalt doped TiO2, the Ti 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 binding energy values are decreased with increasing cobalt concentration (Fig. 5A). The decrease in binding energy of Ti2p band on impregnation of Co2+ ions could be the result of the interaction between Co and TiO2. In general, Co 2p3/2 characteristic peaks for Co0, CoO, Co2O3 and Co3O4 appear at 779.9, 780.4, 779.4 and 779.8 eV respectively [38]. In cobalt doped TiO2 samples, the binding energies for Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 are slightly increased with increasing cobalt content and appear at 780.48–780.72 eV and 796.15–796.32 eV. These bands are assigned to CoO (Fig. 5B and Table 2 ). The presence of strong shakeup satellites at 786.1 and 802.92 eV (Fig. 5B) may indicate that the oxidation state of Co is +2 [39]. O1s spectra of TiO2 show the characteristic peaks of Ti–O linkages at 529.9 eV and TiO2 surface hydroxyls groups at 531.9 eV [36,40]. In 0.5CT catalyst, binding energy values for O1s appeared at 529.22 eV and 530.66; and with an increase in cobalt concentration, the binding energy values are slightly decreased. These shifts can be attributed to the formation of Ti–O–Co linkages (Fig. 5C and Table 2) [41]. The Co 2p XPS spectra of used and reduced catalysts are shown in Fig. 6 . In 1CTS catalyst, the binding energy values appeared at 780.25 and 795.82 eV for Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively, indicating that there is no change in oxidation state of Co even after using the catalyst for several hours under solar irradiation. In 1CTR catalyst, the binding energy values of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 appeared at 780.00 and 795.13 eV, indicating that cobalt is in reduced state. In 1CTU catalyst, the binding energy values appeared at 780.05 and 795.20 eV for Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively, indicating that the cobalt oxidation state changed to +2 to 0 after several hours of reaction under UV light irradiation."
12,EPR analysis,"3.6 EPR analysis Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy is a very useful technique to provide electronic structure of paramagnetic states. Fig. 7 shows that the EPR spectra of the typical samples 1CT and 3CT which were recorded at room temperature. The spectrum is characterized by a strong EPR signal, which is normally the result of high spin Co2+ ions on TiO2 surface [42]."
13,Photocatalytic activity,"3.7 Photocatalytic activity 3.7.1 H2 production from pure water Photocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting is carried out over TiO2 and cobalt doped TiO2 photocatalysts under solar light irradiation. Hydrogen production was not observed on bare TiO2 catalyst. Fig. 8 a shows the hydrogen production from water splitting over cobalt doped TiO2 photocatalysts. Maximum hydrogen production of 220 μ mol h−1 g−1 is observed on 2CT catalyst. H2 and O2 production from pure water over cobalt doped TiO2 catalysts are reported in Table 3 . H2 and O2 production reached stoichiometry on 2CT catalyst where H2 production observed is also of optimum level. 3.7.2 H2 production from glycerol water mixtures The cobalt doped TiO2 photocatalysts are also evaluated in glycerol water mixtures under solar light irradiation as shown in Fig. 8b. The doping of cobalt on TiO2 resulted in a substantial improvement in the H2 evolution. In cobalt doped TiO2, samples showed much higher photocatalytic activity compared with pure water. When the Co concentration increased above 1wt%, the photocatalytic activity decreased gradually. The higher photocatalytic activity of cobalt doped samples with increasing Co loading up to 1CT could be due to the improved dispersion of Co particles over TiO2 photocatalyst. This may be seen as that at 1 wt% cobalt loading on TiO2, the light harvesting as well as the lower electron–hole recombination are satisfied. The evolved H2 and CO2 values from glycerol: water mixtures are shown in Table 3. It may be noted that H2 production with respect CO2 is always higher than the stoichiometric ratio 7:3 (H2: CO2). Our earlier studies on Cu2O/TiO2 also showed higher H2 production in glycerol: water mixtures [37]. The possible sources for the excess H2 production from glycerol: water mixtures may be seen as due to change in the band gap position leading to synergistic activity (additional water splitting) and CO2 dissolution under the reaction conditions disturbing the stoichiometric ratios. 3.7.3 Effect of glycerol concentration Effect of glycerol concentration on hydrogen production activity over 1CT catalyst is also studied under solar irradiation to find out the optimum amount of glycerol required for the maximum hydrogen production and is shown in Fig. 9 a. None of the catalysts produce considerable amount of hydrogen in pure water. Addition of small amount of glycerol (1 vol%) shows a very good improvement in hydrogen production activity. With increasing glycerol concentration up to 5% (v/v), an increase in the hydrogen production is observed; and with further increase of glycerol concentration, the hydrogen production activity is seen decreasing and this may be due to saturation of catalyst active sites [37,43]. The 1CT catalyst exhibits the highest H2 production activity. Therefore, the time-on-stream activity is studied on 1CT photocatalyst. 3.7.4 Time on stream activity Fig. 9b shows the cumulative H2 and CO2 production over the optimum 1CT catalyst. The H2 and CO2 production activity after 25 h of reaction time, saturation of reactor is observed by the evolved gases suppressing the activity. However, when the activity tests were conducted by evacuating the evolved gases at regular intervals (5 h), a linear continuous and stable activity was observed under solar irradiation as shown in Fig. 10 a. When the same reaction was carried out under UV irradiation, after the third cycle, the activity was seen decreasing (Fig. 10b) and this may be caused by the loss of cobalt ions in to the solution [36,44]. 3.7.5 Effect of pH on H2 production The effect of pH equal to 2, 4, 6 (natural), 9, and 12 is carried over 1CT catalyst using glycerol water mixture solutions under solar light irradiation as shown in Fig. 11 . The pH is adjusted using dilute HNO3 and NaOH. Maximum H2 evolution is obtained when the reaction carried out at pH = 6 (natural) and the H2 production rate is low at pH ≤ 4 and pH ≥ 9 conditions. It is interesting to note that more H2 evolution occurs at neutral pH. Thus, a neutral condition is favorable for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, while acidic and basic conditions are unfavorable. This can be due to several reasons, like effect of pH on the positions of the valence and conduction band levels of the semiconductor, and the surface charge of the semiconductor [21], on the other hand, adsorption of glycerol on catalyst may be another important factor that affects the photocatalytic reaction. The surface charge and surface acidity–basicity characteristics influence the adsorption of glycerol on TiO2 [14]. 3.7.6 Effect of substrates (alcohols) The hydrogen production activity is studied by changing substrates (alcohols). In this regard, experiments were conducted with methanol, ethanol, glycerol, ethylene glycol and iso-propanol water mixtures under solar irradiation over 1CTcatlyst and the results are shown in Fig. 12 . While both glycerol and ethylene glycol were found to have higher activity, methanol, ethanol and iso-propanol alcohols showed considerably lower production of molecular hydrogen. The hydrogen production rate in general depends on substrate polarity, the hydrogen production rate increased with an increase in the polarity of alcohols showing a trend Iso-propanol < Ethanol < Methanol < Ethylene glycol < Glycerol [45]."

These cobalt doped TiO2 catalysts are characterized XRD, EDAX, DRS, TEM, XPS and EPR are evaluated for H2 production using pure water and glycerol: water mixtures under solar light irradiation. 3. The DRS spectra of Cobalt doped TiO2 catalysts show that the Co2+ ions could expand the photo response of TiO2 into visible region. TEM images show that the impregnated Co particles are of very fine size. EDAX results confirm the presence of cobalt species on the surface of TiO2, and XPS analysis indicates that Co2+ ions are in interaction with TiO2. 4. Activity studies of Cobalt doped TiO2 calcined, used and reduced catalysts show that Co2+ ions that are interaction with TiO2 are responsible for the hydrogen production activity under solar light irradiation. 5. Optimal hydrogen production activity is obtained for 1 wt% cobalt doped TiO2 under solar light irradiation & effect of glycerol concentration, pH of the solution and other substrates on the hydrogen production are investigated on this catalyst. 6. When these catalysts are studied under UV irradiation, a 3–4 fold increase in activity is observed and this activity is seen decreasing with time. However, a stable and continuous activity is observed for hydrogen production activity on cobalt doped TiO2 catalyst under solar light irradiation."
