0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is considered as a clean and environmental friendly fuel for the future. It can be used as the fuel for hydrogen feed-vehicles or for fuel cell to produce the electricity. Water is the only product without any emission of carbon dioxide. Hydrogen can also be produced from many resources, such as reforming of fossil fuels [1–3], water electrolysis, biological processes, thermal decomposition, and biomass gasification. However, hydrogen generated from reforming, thermal decomposition, and biological processes produce CO2. To control and to reduce the emission of CO2, it requires an effective technology of separation and capture of CO2 [4,5]. Hydrogen storage still remains a technical barrier to be solved. Present hydrogen storage technologies are high-pressure tank, cryogenic storage, metal hydride, physic absorption, and chemical absorption. The hydrogen storage density is far less than 6%, a border line specified by DOE for transportation application. Although hydrogen has many advantages, it has few barriers to be overcome before it can be used in our daily life. The hydrogen distribution and transportation infrastructure is not ready and is costly. Low flash point and explosion danger are hydrogen safety issues to be considered. Ammonia was proposed as a promising energy carrier instead of hydrogen [6]. Zamfirescu and Dincer [7] compared various properties of several fuels, such as gasoline, natural gas, liquid petroleum gas, methanol, hydrogen, and ammonia. At storage pressure of 10 bar, gravimetric energy densities of gasoline and ammonia are 46.7 and 22.5 MJ kg−1, respectively. Their volumetric energy densities are 34.4 and 13.6, MJ L−3, respectively. Ammonia has much higher energy density than compressed hydrogen and liquefied hydrogen. In addition, hydrogen generated from ammonia (NH3) is zero CO2 emission. Ammonia was proposed as alternate energy carrier instead of hydrogen [7,8]. Ammonia is commercially produced from hydrogen and atmospheric nitrogen by Haber–Bosch process. Producing ammonia from hydrogen and then decomposing ammonia to generate hydrogen is not cost effective and the overall energy efficiency is low. However, ammonia is attractive to portable application where easy storage and energy density are primary concern. For portable application, reactor miniaturization and operation at ambient temperature are critical issues. Ammonia decomposition is a reversible reaction as given by equation (1). Calculated from web site data [9], the equilibrium constant of equation (1) is higher at lower temperature. High reaction temperature favors ammonia decomposition. To completely decompose ammonia at fast reaction rate, low reaction temperature is a technical issue to be overcome. (1) 92.5 kJ + 2 NH 3 ← → 3 H 2 + N 2 Two major steps involved in this reaction are the cleavage of the N–H bond of adsorbed NH3 and the recombinative desorption of nitrogen atoms. Yin et al. made a mini-review on ammonia decomposition reaction [9]. Many metals, alloys, and compounds of noble metal characters have been tested for ammonia decomposition. These include Fe, Ni, Ir, Pt, Rh, Pd, Ru, and their alloys and compounds. The Ru based catalyst is one of the promising catalysts for ammonia decomposition due to its high reactivity [4,5,11,12]. Yin et al. [10] found that 15% of Ru is the optimal Ru loading for high conversion efficiency of ammonia. The ammonia conversion efficiency is also affected by the catalyst substrates such as active carbon, graphite, carbon nano-tube, aluminum oxide, titanium oxide, magnesium oxides, etc [1–4,10]. Ru on carbon nano-tube has the best catalytic activity. Good substrate not only has good catalyst dispersion ability but also electronic conductive. Conductive substrate makes the electron transfer easy between catalyst and promoter. Promoter accelerates the recombination desorption of nitrogen atoms. Alkali and alkali earth metals such as K, Na, Li, Ba, Ca, Cs, and La were studied as the promoter [5,11,13]. Ru on carbon with Cs as the promoter, has high ammonia decomposition rate even at temperature below 400 °C [11]. This is very attractive for proton exchange membrane fuel cell application. In this study, Ru catalyst was prepared by reduction and precipitation method. The effect of solution pH and reducing agent concentration on the Ru deposition was evaluated. Cesium promoter was deposited on the Ru catalyst. The decomposition rate of ammonia as well as the hydrogen generation rate was measured at different Ru–Cs catalyst compositions, ammonia inlet flows, decomposition temperatures, and amount of catalyst packing. Catalyst was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), contact angle meter (CA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), and X-ray diffraction analyzer (XRD)."
1,Experimental,"The experiment was divided into three consecutive parts, the carbon powder pre-treatment, catalyst deposition, and ammonia decomposition reaction. Entire experimental procedure is schematic presented on Fig. 1 . The carbon powder was used as the substrate. It was pre-treated with alcohols or acids. Various carbon powder pre-treatment conditions were evaluated first. Then Ru/C and Cs–Ru/C catalysts were deposited on the pre-treated carbon by two different processes. Finally, the catalyst was placed in a tubular reactor and the hydrogen production rate was measured. The experimental procedure and conditions were described below."
2,Pre-treatment of carbon power,"2.1 Pre-treatment of carbon power Carbon powder (Cobot, XC-72R) is used as the substrate for catalyst. It has surface area around 250 m2 g−1 and electrical conductivity 2.77 S cm−1. Carbon powder was mixed with pre-treatment solution at 80 °C for 12 h under reflux condition. Different solutions were tested. They are water, methanol (Echo Chem. CO., 99.5%), ethanol (Echo Chem. Co., 99.9%), sulfuric acid (Shimakyu, 98%), hydrochloric acid (Shimakyu, 32%), hydrogen peroxide (Shimakyu, 35%), and nitric acid (Shimakyu, 69%). The pH value of the mixture was adjusted to 7.0 by ammonia after the mixture was cold. The carbon powder was centrifugation separated, D.I. water rinsed, and vacuum oven dried at 60 °C. The powder was grinded by a mortar to fine powder and they are ready for catalyst deposition. The carbon powder was examined by FTIR and contact angle measurement. For FTIR measurement, a 0.1 mg carbon powder was mixed with 0.1 g KBr by mortar. This mixture was then pressed into a pellet. Measurement was carried out with an FTIR spectrometer (JASCO FT/IT-470). For contact angle measurement, carbon powder was adhesive on a carbon tape. Excessive powder was blow away by air. A water drop was rest on the carbon powder surface. After 3 min, the contact angle was measured by contact angle analysis system (APPR FTA-125)."
3,Preparation of Ru–Cs catalyst,"2.2 Preparation of Ru–Cs catalyst Deposition of Ru on carbon powder was prepared either by chemical reduction or by precipitation. In both methods, carbon powder (XC-72) was pre-treated with acid first. One gram of the pre-treated carbon powder was then mixed with de-ionized water. Two precursor solutions were prepared. One solution was 5 g of RuCl3 dissolved in 200 ml de-ionized water. The other one was 10 g Ru(NO)(NO3)3 dissolved in 200 ml de-ionized water. Proper amount of these precursor solutions were well mixed with carbon powder suspension. Then, the pH of this suspension solution was adjusted by NaOH solution to desired value. In chemical reduction, reducing agent, such as NaBH4, C6H12O6, CH3OH, or C2H5OH was then added into the carbon suspension solution. This mixture was reflux at 70 °C for 6 h and Ru/C catalyst was produced. In the precipitation method, the mixture of carbon and precursor suspension was reflux at 70 C for 12 h without reducing agent. In both methods, the Ru/C catalyst was centrifugation separated, rinsed with D.I. water, vacuum oven dried at 60 °C. Several reduction parameters were investigated in this study. These parameters are: solution pH values (pH = 4, 6, 8, and 10), type of reducing agent, and their concentration. Reducing agents were sodium borohydride (NaBH4, Sigma–Aldrich, 99%), methanol (CH3OH, Echo, 99.9%), ethanol (C2H5OH, Echo, 99.5%), and glucose (C6H12O6, Merck, d(+)-glucose). Various amount of cesium promoter was deposited on the Ru catalyst. The weight ratio of Ru–Cs is in the range of Cs/Ru = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Mapping of energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction meter (XRD) were used to characterize synthesized catalysts. Amount of Ru in the catalyst was measured by EDS attached within the field effect scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The Ru–Cs catalyst was prepared from Ru/C catalyst. The Ru/C catalyst powder was pressed into a thin porous sheet. Given amount of the CsNO3 solution was slowly added on the Ru/C sheet. This Ru–Cs sheet was then dried at 100 °C. The ammonia decomposition efficiency was tested with catalyst containing different Cs/Ru ratios (Cs/Ru = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)."
4,Hydrogen production by ammonia reformer test,"2.3 Hydrogen production by ammonia reformer test Synthesized catalyst was placed into a tubular reactor. The tubular reactor was a stainless steel tube with 1/4 inch ID. Both end of the tube was filled with fiber glass. Catalyst was filled between both ends of fiber glass. The reactor was heated by a cylindrical heater. Ammonia was fed into the reactor through a mass flow controller (flow rate 3, 4.5, 6, and 7.5 ml min−1). Various reaction conditions were tested, such as catalyst composition (percentage of Ru, Cs, and carbon), amount of catalyst, flow rate of ammonia, and reactor temperature. Effluent gas from the reactor was bubble through a trap containing 10 vol% sulfuric acid solution. Residue ammonia from the reactor was removed by this trap. The ammonia conversion efficiency and hydrogen production rate were calculated. The flow rate of effluent gas (V Effluent) was measured by a bubble flow meter. Effects of gas temperature and pressure were corrected during data analysis. Concentration of hydrogen in the effluent gas ( C H 2 ) was measured by a gas chromatography (China Gas Chromatography, GC 3000) with an Ultrafast column (Thermo Fisher, Trace UFM-M1). Measuring temperature of TCD, injection port, and oven were at 110 °C. The TCD current was set at 50 mA. Operating condition was The hydrogen production rate ( V H 2 ) is the product of V Effluent and C H 2 · ( V H 2 = V Effluent × C H 2 ) The ammonia conversion efficiency is the ratio of consumed ammonia ( V NH 3 , cons ) to the inlet ammonia ( V NH 3 , inlet ) . The inlet flow rate of ammonia was read from the mass flow controller. The ammonia consumption rate of ammonia can be calculated from the hydrogen production rate ( V H 2 ) . According to the ammonia decomposition reaction (equation (1)), one mole hydrogen produced consumes 0.67 mol of ammonia."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effects of acid treatment on carbon properties,"3.1 Effects of acid treatment on carbon properties In order to increase functional groups on the carbon power surface, the carbon surface was treated with different solutions. Solutions have been tested are nitric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrogen peroxide, ethanol, and methanol. The type of functional groups on the surface was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Fig. 2 is the FTIR spectra of carbon powder after solution treatment. Legends from 1 to 8 marked on Fig. 2 were the FTIR spectra of carbon after treated by nitric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrogen dioxide, ethanol, methanol, de-ionized water. For comparison, legend 8 was the FTIR spectrum of untreated carbon. Six functional group were detected on the acid treated carbon surface, They are carboxylic group (C–O stretching in 1210–1320 cm−1, and CO stretching in 1710–1780 cm−1), alcohol (OH in-plane bending in 1330–1430 cm−1 and OH stretching in 3200–3550 cm−1), aromatic (CC bending in 1500–1680 cm−1), and alkyl (C–H stretching at 2850 and 2950 cm−1). Nitric acid is a strong oxidant. The carbon surface can be oxidized into various functional groups by nitric acid. Carbon surface treated with nitric acid has the most distinguish peaks on FTIR spectra. The CO bond signals in the wave number 1710–1780 cm−1 and a OH (in-plane) bond signals in wave number 1330–1430 cm−1 were observed. The function group on the carbon powder is increased after pre-treatment. These functional groups, such as CO and C–OH are hydrophilic. Carbon powder with hydrophilic surface helps the penetration of metal precursor solution into the pores on carbon surface. The level of hydrophilic surface is evaluated by measuring the contact angle of droplet on the carbon surface. Contact angle measurement results are listed on Table 1 . The original carbon powder is hydrophobic surface. The contact angles of surface treated with water or alcohols are similar to the surface of original carbon powder. Water and alcohol treatment do not improve the hydrophobicity of carbon powder surface. Among acidic treatment, nitric acid is the most effective treatment. The contact angle of nitric acid treatment is 45°. It is followed by hydrogen peroxide, hydrochloric acid, and sulfuric acid. From the FTIR spectra and contact angle measurement, result shown that nitric acid is the most effective pre-treatment. In the following study, all the carbon powder was pre-treated with nitric acid."
7,Deposition of Ru and Ru/Cs catalyst,"3.2 Deposition of Ru and Ru/Cs catalyst The reactor performance of ammonia decomposition is strongly affected by the amount of Ru metal on the catalyst or the weight percentage of Ru in the catalyst (Ru%). In order to control the Ru% in the catalyst, it is important to find out the relationship between Ru% and deposition conditions. The Ru catalyst can be prepared by chemical reduction and by precipitation. The Ru% prepared from these two processes was evaluated. Table 2 is the list of Ru% prepared from two different precursor (RuCl3 and Ru(NO)(NO3)3) and two deposition processes (Chemical reduction and precipitation). The pH values for each deposition process are also listed on Table 2. They were prepared from the solution containing fixed amount of Ru precursor. Ten weight percent of Ru shall be obtained if all the Ru ions in the solution were deposited on the carbon powder. In the reduction process, different reducing agents were tested as listed on Table 2. For comparison, the solution pH value was adjusted to 10. In the precipitation, the solutions with pH value at 4, 6, 8, and 10 were tested. For a given amount of precursor, catalyst prepared by sodium borohydride (NaBH4) has the most Ru content as compared to other reducing agent. About 55% of the precursor ion was deposited on the carbon powder. In the precipitation method, solution with pH value at 6 produces the highest Ru content. About 86% of the precursor was deposited on the carbon powder. The type of precursor (RuCl3, Ru(NO)(NO3)3) plays a minor role on the Ru%. Catalyst prepared by precipitation method with solution pH at 6 has the most Ru deposited on the carbon powder. The effect of precursor concentration on the catalyst Ru % was also studied. Both precursors, (Ru(NO)(NO3)3 and RuCl3) were evaluated. Precursor concentration range was from 5% to 30% theoretical content. The solution pH value was controlled at 6 for these experiments. As shown on Table 3 , both precursors produce similar result and the Ru % is linearly proportional to the precursor concentration. Less Ru was deposited from the RuCl3 solution than from the Ru(NO)(NO3)3 solution (Table 4 )."
8,Morphology and crystal structure of Ru and Ru/Cs catalyst,"3.3 Morphology and crystal structure of Ru and Ru/Cs catalyst Catalyst with different Cs/Ru ratio (from 0 to 6) was prepared. The CsNO3 solution was added into the Ru/C catalyst and it was then dried at 100 °C. Both Ru/C and CsRu/C catalyst morphology was examined as given on Fig. 3 a for Ru/C and Fig. 3b for CsRu/C. The size of Cs particle is in the order of 10 nm. From the element mapping (Fig. 3c for Ru and Fig. 3d for Cs), both Ru and Cs were uniformly dispersed on the carbon powder. The crystal structure of Ru/C and CsRu/C catalyst was examined by XRD. No obvious crystal signal was observed for the Ru/C catalyst prepared from either chemical reduction or precipitation methods as shown on Fig. 4 . Sample 4 and 5 were the Ru/C catalyst prepared from RuCl3 and Ru(NO)(NO3)3, respectively. Sample 6 and 7 were the CsRu/C catalyst prepared from Ru/C catalyst 4 and 5, respectively. The XRD result of commercial Ru/C catalyst (5% Ru Aldrich) also has no crystal signal detected. One possible reason is that the Ru content is too low to have significant XRD signal or the Ru deposit was in amorphous form. However, the XRD of CsRu/C catalyst (Cs/Ru = 4) observes clear Cs signals at 19.9°, 28.3°, 34.8°, 40.5°, 45.4°, and 50°. Possible phases at these angles are (110), (004), (103), (112), (105), and (311)."
9,Effects of Ru contents on ammonia decomposition reaction,"3.4 Effects of Ru contents on ammonia decomposition reaction Ammonia decomposition is endothermic reaction. High temperature favors decomposition. At 400 °C, equilibrium conversion reaches 99.1% [10]. Calculated from web site data [9], the equilibrium constant at 300, 400, 500, and 600 K, are 2.30 × 102, 6.10 × 103, 6.90 × 104, 4.40 × 105. From these data, the equilibrium constant of ammonia decomposition (K eq) was calculated as given by equation (2). (2) K eq = 6 × 10 5 × e [ − 4505 / T ] = [ H 2 3 ] [ N 2 ] [ NH 3 ] − 2 In our reaction temperature range (between 375 and 500 °C), the K eq are 5.74 × 102 (at 375 °C) and 1.77 × 103 (at 500 °C). At equilibrium, the conversion efficiency of ammonia decomposition reaction is nearly 100%. The ammonia conversion efficiency and hydrogen production rate with different Ru catalyst loading were given on Fig. 5 . These tests were carried out at ammonia inlet flow of 6 ml min−1, 0.012 g Ru catalyst packing, reaction temperature at 400 °C and at 450 °C. Three types of catalyst were examined, catalyst prepared from RuCl3, Ru(NO)(NO3)3, and commercial grade Ru catalyst. Gas sample was taken after 2.5 reaction time. The ammonia GHSV was at 30,000 ml h−1 gcat −1. In general, higher reaction temperature produces higher conversion efficiency ( ɛ NH 3 ) and hydrogen production rate ( V H 2 ) . Higher Ru loading also has higher ɛ NH 3 and V H 2 . The improvement of ɛ NH 3 and V H 2 becomes minor for Ru contain higher than 15%. This is due to high Ru catalyst loading results a short catalyst packing length (constant catalyst packing 0.012 g and ammonia inlet flow rate). At a given reaction temperature and Ru loading, catalyst prepared from Ru(NO)(NO3)3, has the highest ɛ NH 3 and V H 2 . The catalyst prepared from RuCl3 may have residual Cl− on the catalyst. It reacts with NH3 and produces NH4Cl precipitation on the catalyst surface. This reduces the ɛ NH 3 and V H 2 for catalyst prepared from RuCl3."
10,Effects of ammonia inlet flow,"3.5 Effects of ammonia inlet flow For a given amount of catalyst packing (0.024 g), the effect of ammonia flow rate on the hydrogen production rate is examined at reaction temperature of 375 °C, 400 °C, 425 °C and 450 °C. Result is plotted on Fig. 6 . High ammonia flow rate enhance the mass transfer of ammonia to the catalyst surface and it results a high hydrogen production rate. This is especially true for high reaction temperature i.e., 450 °C than for low reaction temperature, i.e., 375 °C. At a given flow rate, the decomposition reaction of ammonia is shifted from kinetic controlled to mass transfer controlled as the reaction temperature increased."
11,Effect of reaction temperature,"3.6 Effect of reaction temperature The hydrogen production rate is also a function of reaction temperature as shown on Fig. 7 . The hydrogen production rate increased as the reaction temperature (T) increased. According to Arrhenius equation, the plot of logarithm rate against 1/T shall yield a straight line as given on equation (3). The activation energy of ammonia decomposition reaction (E a) can be calculated from the slope of this line. (3) ln ( rate ) = ln ( k o ) − E a R 1 T The value of E a is in the range between 54 and 72 kJ mol−1 in the ammonia inlet flow rate of 3.0–7.5 ml min−1 Table 5 lists the activation energy of various catalysts found in the literature. The activation energy may be substrate dependence. Catalyst Ru on oxide substrate has activation energy around 80–90 kJ mol−1 (Table 5). Catalyst Ru on conductive substrate, such as carbon in our case, the activation energy is around 54–72 kJ mol−1. Conductive substrate may provide an electronic path for the redox reaction taking place on the catalyst surface."
12,Effect of catalyst Ru/Cs ratio on hydrogen production rate,"3.7 Effect of catalyst Ru/Cs ratio on hydrogen production rate At a given catalyst packing (0.012 g), ammonia inlet flow (6 ml min−1), the hydrogen production rate of catalyst with different weight ratio of cesium promoter (Cs/Ru = 0–6) is plotted on Fig. 8 . A maximum production rate of hydrogen is at Cs/Ru = 3 for reaction temperature at 375 °C and 400 °C. At his Cs/Ru ratio, the ammonia conversion efficiency reaches 90% and hydrogen production rate reaches 29.8 mmol/min-gcat. at 400 °C. The Cs is acting a promoter, the hydrogen production rate is higher for catalyst containing higher Cs in the region Cs/Ru ≤ 3. The hydrogen production rate is lower for catalyst containing higher Cs in the region Cs/Ru ≥ 3. In this region, excessive amount of Cs converts the Ru surface and the hydrogen production rate is reduced."
13,Short-term durability test of catalysts,"3.8 Short-term durability test of catalysts A 24 h continue running of ammonia decomposition was carried out under reaction temperature at 400 °C and ammonia flow rate at 6 ml min−1. Three catalysts were tested. They are Ru:Cs ratio of 1:0, 1:3, and 1:4 Cs–Ru/C catalyst. Results were shown on Fig. 9 . The Ru/C catalyst has the lowest performance among catalyst under testing. The average conversion efficiency of Ru/C over 24 h was about 37% and hydrogen production rate was about 12 m mol min−1 gcat −1. The ammonia conversion rate of Cs–Ru/C (1:3) was about 90% and the hydrogen production rate was 29.8 m mol min−1 gcat −1. After 23 h reaction, the ammonia conversion rate dropped 3.1% and the hydrogen production rate was dropped 0.74 m mol min−1 gcat −1. The ammonia conversion rate of Cs–Ru/C (1:4) was about 76% and the hydrogen production rate was 25.3 m mol min−1 gcat −1. After 23 h reaction, the ammonia conversion rate dropped 2.1% and the hydrogen production rate dropped 0.7 m mol min−1 gcat −1. The ammonia conversion efficiency and hydrogen production rate was relative stable without significant degradation over 24 h of reaction time."
14,Conclusion,"The XC-72 carbon power treated with nitric acid has the most significant effects on its surface property among acids and alcohols tested in this study. Nitric acid changes the carbon powder surface from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. The NaBH4 in acid solution reduces the highest amount of Ru deposit in chemical reduction. However, precipitation method at pH = 6 was higher then by chemical reduction method. The EFSEM mapping result shows that both Ru and Cs deposits were uniformly dispersed over the entire carbon sample. The ammonia conversion efficiency and hydrogen production rate are higher as the Ru wt% increased up to 15 wt.% of Ru. Excessive Ru on carbon powder may be aggregated and sintered which leads to low catalyst activity. Higher ammonia conversion efficiency and hydrogen production rate was obtained with slow ammonia inlet flow rate and high reaction temperature. Reaction temperature has significant effects on the ammonia decomposition reaction. As the catalyst packing quantity increased, the ammonia conversion efficiency is improved; however the hydrogen production rate (per unit catalyst) is decreased. Ammonia conversion efficiency of 90% and hydrogen production rate of 30 m mol min−1 gcat −1 was obtained with Cs–Ru/C (1:3) catalyst. Catalyst tested over 24 h continuous operation, no significant performance degradation was observed."
