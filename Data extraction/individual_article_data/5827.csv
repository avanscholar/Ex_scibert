0,Introduction,"The refractory nature of waste rubber leads to “black pollution” globally, and the mounting environmental problems related to tire rubber become a common concern of the whole society [1–3]. Annually, there are nearly 1000 million tires from the motor vehicles to be disposed [4]. The traditional tire-burning method, widely utilized in waste disposal in previous years, results in serious air pollution problems and fire hazards. Hence, it is necessary to explore the sustainable and environmental-friendly method to consume and dispose of the waste tire rubbers. In recent years, a new field for recycling and applicating of waste rubber is to utilize them as the substitution for aggregate in the production of concrete materials [5–8], a filler for non-load bearing structures [9] and modifiers to asphalt paving mixtures [10], etc. Using rubber as the recycled aggregate can significantly reduce the consumption of natural resources in concrete manufacture, and decrease the pollution emission to a great extent [11–13]. Also, incorporating waste rubber in the cement-based matrix can enhance physical, thermal properties and durability, which is a promising application in the construction material industry. For the widespread application of waste rubber to concrete, the major limitation is the loss of mechanical properties [14]. Improving the performance of rubber concrete by selecting suitable materials is an effective approach that has been a concern in recent years [15,16]. Segre et al. treated the rubber particles by NaOH and found that the toughness and abrasion resistance were improved compared to untreated rubber [5]. Dong et al. reported a cementitious coating layer around rubber particles by silane coupling agent, which can improve the performance of the rubber concrete [17]. Similarly, Chou et al. pretreated the waste rubber with sulfur compounds and found that the flexural strength, tensile and compression of the rubberized concrete have improved [18]. However, most of these studies require chemical treatment of rubber, which complicates the manufacturing process. Many researchers afford to improve the adhesion between rubber and cement by inducing adhesive. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is one of the most effective adhesive in cement-based composite materials [19]. Balaha et al found that the splitting tensile strength of the rubber concrete after PVA treatment increased by 12%, and the slump value is significantly increased [20]. Since the hydroxyl groups of PVA may improve the surface binding between rubber aggregates and matrix [21,22]. Chen et al. [23] studied the mechanical properties of natural rubber (NR) / PVA blends after thermal-oxidation, and the results showed that the retention of tensile strength showed an upward trend with the increase of PVA. Using PVA-treated aggregate as part or all of the concrete aggregate will increase the slump value [21]. Thai et al. [24] used PVA to prepare a new cost-effective rubber aerogel. After testing, it was found that its performance was comparable to other aerogels made from cellulose and other raw materials. However, the strengthening mechanism of PVA at the interface of rubber and cement-based materials is still unclear, which greatly limits its application and development. Understanding the binding mechanism of PVA between rubber and concrete has practical value for designing rubber reinforced concrete. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation, as a powerful tool to connect the microstructure and macroscopic properties [25–27], provides an alternative approach to understand the modification mechanism of rubber concrete. Many researchers have studied the properties of rubber in the cement system using molecular simulation methods. Yin et al. [25] constructed the C5 petroleum resin and chlorinated butyl rubber (CIIR) composites model with different resin mass ratios, and explored the damping mechanism of these composites. Guo et al. [28] investigated that the resins have better compatibility with styrene-butadiene rubbers than cis-polybutadiene rubber, which has a good agreement with the experimental results. Saha and Bhowmick [29] have predicted the spatial orientation, bond lengths and bond angles of various rubber macromolecular chains by COMPASS force field, such as polybutadiene rubber (BR), natural rubber (NR), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), etc. And they explored the thermoplastic of rubber-plastic blends [30]. However, crosslinking is usually required during rubber applications [29], which is not considered in previous MD studies. In addition, the effects of admixture in rubber concrete are still unclarified. In this study, we used MD simulations to demonstrate the performance of rubber concrete by introducing PVA. The results indicate that the introduction of PVA transforms the interface microstructure and improves the performance of the interface. The bond length and strength distribution are used to better reveal the modification mechanism of the polymer for rubber concrete. In addition, adhesion and friction tests for different interfaces were investigated. It is expected that this work will provide valuable information for designing the high-performance rubber reinforced concrete."
1,Methods,
2,Model for cross-linked rubber,"2.1 Model for cross-linked rubber Polybutadiene rubber (BR) is non-polar and the chain contains a butadiene repeat unit. In the present work, disulfide crosslinks were used to simulate the crosslinking reaction of S = S with specific CH = CH groups in polybutadiene chains. First, a cubic simulation box was constructed, and 20 polybutadiene long chains were inserted into the simulation box, each chain contains 36 repeat units. All the cross-link simulations were conducted in the canonical ensemble (NVT) with the time step of 1 fs. The temperature was maintained at 1298 K for 1 ns. Then the system was annealed from 1298 K to 298 K after 2 ns. Under the thermal annealing process, as shown in Fig. 1 , when double bond carbon atom B moves close to the double bond carbon atom A with a reaction radius R = 4 Å, the active A has a certain probability (50%) of bonding with the B by S = S [31,32]. A and B belong to the two polybutadiene chains, or they can be the farther apart parts of the same polybutadiene chain. Following this, separated long polybutadiene chains transform into the cross-linked rubber system, which can be observed from Fig. 2 . After cross-linking simulation, there were 15 cross-linking points in the system. And the molecular weight between two crosslinking points in the final system is 1.286 × 103 g/mol, which corresponds to the range of real materials (103–105g/mol) [33]."
3,Nanocomposites model construction,"2.2 Nanocomposites model construction The interface molecular structure and other properties of C-S-H/BR and C-S-H/PVA/BR are predicted based on the cross-linked rubber model. First, the structure of tobermorite 11 Å crystal was cracked along the direction [001] to obtain the C–S–H substrate structure [34]. As shown in Fig. 3 (a), the two parallel C–S–H layers are separated by 5.7 nm. The cross-linked BR structures are then placed between parallel C–S–H layers. Further, in the C-S-H/PVA/BR model, to cover the bare C-S-H interface, the 22 PVA chains each with 34 repeat units are inserted between C-S-H and BR, the structural information of PVA can be obtained from previous research [35]. And the C-S-H/PVA/BR model can be observed from Fig. 3(b). The two models have a dimension of 111.60 × 66.51 × 136.62 Å3 (Fig. 4(a) and (b))."
4,Force field and molecular dynamic procedure,"2.3 Force field and molecular dynamic procedure ClayFF force field was used to describe the interactions for both bonded and non-bonded interactions of atoms in the C–S–H gel, which has been widely used in calcium silicate phases and can successfully simulate the structure and other properties [36–38]. And the interatomic interactions in BR and PVA were described using the OPLS-AA potential [39]. OPLS-AA and ClayFF have been successfully applied to many other studies [40–42]. After the initial structures were generated, there was a five steps molecular dynamic calculation procedure: (1) an energy minimization, (2) the C-S-H substrate was “freeze” by rigid body algorithm and the rubber is freely relaxed at NVT for 500 ps, (3) keep the ensemble unchanged and apply an atmospheric pressure to the upper C-S-H substrate, (4) maintain the pressure exerted on the upper layer C-S-H, after 200 ps, release the rigid body setting of the C-S-H substrate, the system was performed in NVT ensemble at 300 K for 500 ps to obtain the balanced structure, (5) the system continues to run another 2 ns under NVT to record the atomic trajectory and energy information."
5,Friction force,"2.4 Friction force Based on the balanced composites structure of C-S-H/BR and C-S-H/PVA/BR, a microcanonical ensemble (NVE) ensemble was employed and only the BR was assigned an initial speed Vx. Then, the Vx of all the atoms in BR was extracted at different sliding distances δ b . Take the C-S-H/PVA/BR system as an example, as shown in Fig. 5 . According to the speed Vx, the global kinetic energy loss Δ E k of the BR during the sliding process can be calculated by [43,44] (1) Δ E k = 1 2 m ( V x 2 ( δ ) - V x 2 ( δ 0 ) ) where m is the mass of the BR, V x 2 ( δ 0 ) is the average speed of all atoms in BR after an assigned initial speed, and V x 2 ( δ ) is the average speed of all atoms in BR after slippage. The friction force F can be given by (2) F = Δ E k δ And the interfacial shear strength τ was computed as: (3) τ = F A where A is the contact area of BR at the interface."
6,Result and discussion,
7,Local structure of BR and PVA,"3.1 Local structure of BR and PVA After crosslinking, the conformational freedom of the BR was greatly limited. Therefore, the conformation of BR cannot be freely changed, which leads to the accumulation of stress in the composites system, especially at the cross-linking point. Therefore, the local geometry of the crosslinked structure is different from that of the non-crosslinked structure [29]. At first, the intensity distributions of Ca, Si, O, C, H atoms perpendicular to the C-S-H substrate plane in the composites structure were studied. Ow is the oxygen atom in water molecules, Cb, Cp is the carbon atoms in BR and PVA, Hb, Hp is the hydrogen atom in BR and PVA, and Op is the oxygen atom in PVA. As shown in Fig. 6 (a), carbon atoms exhibit a distinct bimodal distribution in the sandwich area of C-S-H, with hydrogen atoms distributed closer to the C-S-H interface. The intensity peaks of the Cb and Hb atoms on the BR chains overlap with the Ca and Si atoms on the C-S-H interface, which indicates that the BR cross-linked long chains can insert into the silicon chain gap of C-S-H on the C-S-H/BR interface. And this insertion distribution can be observed in Fig. 7 (a). After introducing the PVA in the system, the intensity distribution of the system can be observed in Fig. 6(b). The distribution of BR (Cb and Hb) at 35 Å −55 Å become narrowed at 37.5 Å −50 Å, which demonstrates that the BR structure distributes more orderly. The bimodal distribution of the Cb on the BR almost disappears, and The distance between the Cb or Hb and the interface is substantially the same. These intensity distributions of PVA indicate that the PVA chains are not regularly distributed at the C-S-H interface. By further analyzing the trajectory file for the balanced structure, it can be found that the ends of the PVA chains can invade into the interior of the cross-linked rubber, as shown in Fig. 7 (b). The intra-molecular and inter-molecular radial distribution functions (RDF) of carbon atoms for the cross-linked BR were shown in Fig. 8 . And the corresponding local structure of the cross-linked BR was described in Fig. 9 . The positions of the first peak in the RDF for bonded atoms represent the relevant bond distances[45]. For the non-bonded atoms, the peaks represent the distance of the adjacent pairs. All the RDF curves were obtained by calculating the distance average for a large number of different adjacent pairs present in the system. In cross-linked BR chains, there are four kinds of carbon atoms Ch1, Ch1s, Ch2, Ch3 in different chemical environments. The subscript number of Ch1, Ch2 and Ch3 represent the number of connected hydrogen atoms. Ch1s represents cross-linked carbon atoms, one end connected to a hydrogen atom and the other end connected to a sulfur atom. As shown in Fig. 8(a), for the bonded carbon atoms in the C-S-H/BR system, the bond length of the C = C double bond is the shortest, which is the only 1.36 Å that is consistent with the studies of Saha et. al. [29]. In addition, there are many types of C–C single bonds, and their length are ordered as: Ch1-Ch3 < Ch1-Ch1s = Ch2-Ch2 < Ch1-Ch2 = Ch2-Ch1s. The Peak 2, 5, 8 and 14 represent the distance of the corresponding second adjacent pairs, there are, the distance of Ch1-Ch2, Ch2-Ch2, Ch2-Ch1s and Ch1-Ch3 in Fig. 8. The length of the third adjacent pairs, Ch1-Ch2, Ch2-Ch2 and Ch2-Ch1s of the BR main chain is demonstrated by Peak 3, 6, 9. The distance between the two cross-linking carbon atoms that belong to different BR chains was depicted by Peak 10 (3.86 Å). In the model of C-S-H/PVA/BR, there is a slight change in the carbon atoms RDF. The position of Peak 10 is shifted from 3.86 Å to 4.06 Å, and the position of Peak 8 is shifted from 2.70 Å to 2.62 Å. The peak widths of the characteristic Peak 10 and 8 are also narrowed. In addition, some peak positions are shifted to the left, for example, Peak 5 moves from 3.95 Å to 3.87 Å, which indicates that the interior of the cross-linking system is more regular by introducing PVA. As shown in Fig. 10 (a), carbon atoms in PVA can be classified into three categories according to different chemical environments: Cp3, Cp2 and Cpoh. All the RDF curves of inter-molecular carbon atoms between the PVA and the cross-linked BR in C-S-H/PVA/BR system were present in Supporting Information. Fig. 10(b) shows the RDF between Cp3 in the PVA and the Ch1s in the cross-linked BR for C-S-H/PVA/BR system. The regular multimodal distribution of the RDF curve of Cp3-Ch1s and the position of the first peak verified that the end of the PVA chains can deeply insert into the cross-linked BR. However, there is no chemical bond connection between PVA and BR, only van der Waals and electrostatic forces, and the non-bonding interaction will be discussed in Section 3.4. It can be observed from Fig. 11 (a) that the spatial disposition of the atoms in the C-S-H/PVA/BR. There are three kinds of oxygen atoms around the calcium atom at the C-S-H/PVA interface. The RDF of the Ca-O ion bond was calculated as shown in Fig. 11(b). The peak of Ca-Op illustrates the presence of ionic bonds between C-S-H and PVA. The bond length of Ca-Op is about 2.5 Å, which is consistent with the results obtained in previous studies [35]. According to the Ca-O RDF curves, we found that the Ca-Os (oxygen atom in the silicon-oxygen tetrahedron of C-S-H) has the shortest ionic bond length, followed by Ca-Op, and the longest is Ca-Ow. Therefore, PVA can form a connection with C-S-H substrate through Os-Ca-Op and Ow-Ca-Op ionic bonds. It seems that PVA may play a bridging role between C-S-H and BR. In addition, the RDF curves of Ca-O in C-S-H/BR are demonstrated in supporting information, which confirms that the introduction of PVA does not change the inherent calcium-oxygen ion bond distribution of the C-S-H. The average coordination numbers (CN) of calcium atoms at the interface were calculated. All the Ca-O cutoff distances are set according to the location for the RDF first peak minimum. As shown in Fig. 12 , in both C-S-H/BR and C-S-H/PVA/BR, Ca can be both coordinated by Os and Ow. And the calcium atoms at the interface have more Os atoms than Ow species. The introduction of PVA will slightly reduce the Os and Ow atoms around the calcium ions. And the CN of Ca-Op is 1.1, which confirms that the PVA connects with the calcium ions."
8,Friction force,"3.2 Friction force In the following, the friction force at different interfaces was evaluated by molecular dynamic simulation [43]. The cross-linked BR is set to an initial velocity Vx0 (1 nm/ps), and the velocity of BR will gradually decrease due to the friction of the interface. After a certain distance ( δ b ) of slippage, the speed of the BR becomes zero. From Fig. 13 , it can be observed that there is a rapid initial drop of Vx in C-S-H/PVA/BR, after that, the decrease rate of Vx becomes slightly slow down. But the variation rate of Vx with δ b in C-S-H/ BR is almost unaltered. This is due to the adhesion energy of PVA and BR is higher, which hinders the movement of cross-linked BR. From the perspective of the atomic spatial distribution, the PVA chains can penetrate deep into the cross-linked BR, resulting in greater steric hindrance. When the initial speed is set to 0.1 nm/ps, the speed reduction has a similar trend, which was present in Supporting Information. By counting the speed of the BR during the slippage process, the friction F and the interfacial shear strength τ can be calculated on the basis of the equation mentioned above. The friction experienced by the BR was counted in the short slippage process. As shown in Table 1 , at the same initial speed, the PVA and BR interfaces have greater shear strength than the C-S-H/BR interface. When the initial velocity of the BR is 0.1 km/s, the interfacial shear strength of C-S-H/PVA/BR is 10.8% higher than that of C-S-H/BR. And when the Vx0 increases to 1 km/s, the shear strength of C-S-H/PVA/BR increased by 86.9% compared to C-S-H/BR. It can be found that the shear strength increases with increasing initial velocity, and this increase is more pronounced in C-S-H/PVA/BR. This trend is due to the rate of increase in entropy, which increases as the temperature difference of the system increases [43]. The greater the initial velocity of the BR, the greater the orderly kinetic energy of the system, and the more the disordered kinetic energy (temperature) is converted."
9,Dynamic properties of the composites,"3.3 Dynamic properties of the composites The translational motion of the atoms was evaluated using the mean square displacement (MSD). A detailed description of the MSD calculation formula can be found in the previous paper [46]. The MSD as a function of time is shown in Fig. 14 . It seems that the cross-linked rubber and single-chain rubber have significant differences in dynamics. In C-S-H/BR, the translational motion of the cross-linked carbon atoms (Ch1s) is close to that of the silicon atoms in the silicon tetrahedron, which is much lower than that of Ch1 and Ch2. Since the cross-linking point is the junction of two long BR chains, the atomic motion here is significantly limited. Whereas the non-crosslinked carbon atoms on the long-chain (Ch1 and Ch2) have relatively free motion and thus have a larger MSD value. The carbon atoms at the ends of the BR chain (Ch3) even have the same tendency as inter-layer water molecules of C-S-H, because the carbon atoms at the ends are less constrained by the local environment and can be freely rotated and translated. The C-S-H/PVA/BR model is shown in Fig. 14(b), it is clear that the addition of PVA reduces the movement of non-crosslinked carbon atoms (Ch1, Ch2), which is due to the steric hindrance [47] and interaction between PVA and BR. Therefore, the PVA has a good coupling of C-S-H from the dynamic perspective. In the C-S-H/BR model, the water molecules have a large MSD value, and it can be seen from the intensity distribution of Fig. 6 that the water molecules (Ow) are located between C-S-H and BR. This local structure indicates that water molecules at the C-S-H/BR interface are likely to act as a lubricant, accelerating the separation of the rubber from the C-S-H. While in the C-S-H/PVA/BR system, the MSD of Ow is reduced due to the Ow-Ca-Op connection between the PVA and C-S-H. Time correlated function (TCF), can be used to qualitatively describe the stability of chemical bonds, is calculated according to the following equation[48]. (4) C ( t ) = δ b ( t ) δ b ( 0 ) δ b ( 0 ) δ b ( 0 ) where δ b ( t ) is a binary value, if the chemical bond is connected, the value is equal to 1, otherwise equal to 0. The TCF evolution of the Ca-O ionic bond can be observed from Fig. 15 . The TCF value of the Ca-Os and Ca-Ow is maintained above 0.94, especially Ca-Os, which remains almost unchanged at 0.95. In the duration of 100 ps, the TCF of Ca-Op decreased from 0.92 to 0.9. The TCF of the three C-O ionic bonds indicates the stability of the Os-Ca-Op and Ow-Ca-Op connection. The orientation of the cross-linked BR chains, described by the gyration radius (Rg ), can evaluate the conformation change of the BR chains [48]. The equation for Rg calculation is as follows: (5) R g 2 = 1 M ∑ i m i ( r i - r cm ) 2 where M is the total mass of the cross-linked BR chains, mi is the mass of the atom i in the BR, ri is the position of the atom i, rcm is the center of the mass position of the cross-linked BR chains. As shown in Fig. 16 , the PVA chains increase the gyration radius of BR from 86.5 Å to 88.5 Å. Due to the relatively weak interaction between C-S-H and BR, in the C-S-H/BR model, BR can easily find the optimal position of energy. However, after the addition of the PVA, the interaction between the PVA and the BR is enhanced, making it more difficult for the BR to reach the energy balance position, resulting in a larger radius of gyration. The interaction between PVA and BR will be detailed in Section 3.4."
10,Modification mechanism,"3.4 Modification mechanism In order to verify whether the compatibility between BR and PVA is better than that between C-S-H and BR, we calculated the adhesion energy of the different interface [49,50]. For example, the C-S-H/PVA interface in the C-S-H/PVA/BR model can be calculated by: (6) Δ E = E total - E C - S - H - E BR + P V A where E total is the potential energy of C-S-H/PVA/BR system, E C - S - H is the potential energy of the C-S-H, and E BR + P V A is the potential energy of the BR and PVA. Fig. 17 presents the comparison of the calculated interfacial adhesion energy in the two systems. The adhesion energy of the system consists of van der Waals forces (VDW) and electrostatic forces. For the three interfaces, their adhesion energy are all mainly provided by VDW action. The electrostatic energy value of C-S-H/BR and PVA/BR is both positive, while compared with the VDW effect, the repulsive electrostatic effect is very small. The adhesion energy of PVA/BR is 13.24% higher than that of C-S-H/BR, which confirms that the PVA can be better combined with rubber than C-S-H. And the trend in increasing adhesion energy of PVA/BR is consistent with experimental results [20]. Furthermore, the adhesion energy of C-S-H/PVA is −9090.24 Kcal/mol in C-S-H/PVA/BR system, which is about 5 times than that of PVA/BR. That also indicates that the PVA chain can serve as a bridge between C-S-H and BR."
11,Conclusion,"A series of structural and dynamic properties, including intensity distribution, radial distribution functions, average coordination numbers, mean square displacement, time-correlated function, gyration radius, adhesion energy, and friction force were calculated to confirm the modification mechanism of PVA insertion into rubber concrete. And the following conclusions can be drawn: 1. After the introduction of PVA at the C-S-H/BR interface, PVA can invade the interior of the cross-linked rubber, making the distribution of BR more closely and orderly, while the local structure of C-S-H will not change due to the addition of PVA. In the new interface formed by introducing PVA in the C-S-H/BR system, PVA can be tightly bonded to C-S-H through Os-Ca-Op and Ow-Ca-Op connection. 2. In the cross-linked polybutadiene rubber, the cross-linking point as the junction of two long BR chains, its atomic motion is significantly limited. Whereas the non-crosslinked carbon atoms on the long-chain have relatively free motion. The addition of PVA eliminates the lubrication of water molecules and reduces the movement of the cross-linked BR in the system. 3. The mechanism of PVA modified rubber cement-based materials comes from two aspects. Firstly, this is due to the strong adhesion energy between PVA and BR, which is 13.24% higher than that of C-S-H/BR. And the adhesion energy is mainly provided by van der Waals force. Secondly, the ends of the PVA chains can invade the interior of the cross-linked polybutadiene rubber, which causes the generation of steric hindrance."
