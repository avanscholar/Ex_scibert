0,Introduction,"Short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) represent a part of the large functionally diverse class of NAD(P)(H)-dependent oxidoreductases, and one of the largest protein families known up to now. They can be found in all forms of life from viruses up to mammalians. SDRs metabolize a wide range of substrates, such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, steroids, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and retinoids (Jörnvall et al., 1999; Kallberg et al., 2002; Kavanagh et al., 2008). All members of this family possess a common protein structural motif for nucleotide binding called Rossmann-fold, which includes the TGxxxGxG sequence (Kavanagh et al., 2008). A further common feature is the YXXXK active site motif, which can be slightly altered within different SDRs subfamilies. Altogether five of these subfamilies have been characterized, based on the sequence composition of the cofactor binding domain and the active catalytic site: classical, extended, intermediate, divergent and complex SDRs (Kallberg et al., 2002). The number of identified SDRs is permanently growing and up to now there are over 140.000 SDRs members listed in the sequence databases (Jörnvall et al., 2015). However, there is always a high demand for new enzymes that are highly active on specific substrates. There are two methods to obtain new catalysts: the first approach includes site-directed mutagenesis of known enzymes, the second one is based on a screening for enzymes in naturally available sources. Environmental diversity leads to selection of rare metabolic properties, where those enzymes are capable of performing unique reactions. Therefore, organisms with diverse metabolic behavior are the perfect source for mining novel enzymes relevant for industrial applications (Shimizu et al., 1997). One such example is the Gram-negative beta-proteobacterium Ralstonia eutropha H16 (now named Cupriavidus necator). R. eutropha H16 is commonly found in soil and fresh water, and shows flexible metabolic behavior. It adapts to both, heterotrophic and autotrophic growth conditions, using organic compounds or hydrogen as the energy source. Moreover, in the absence of oxygen, R. eutropha H16 can perform anaerobic oxidation by denitrification. This bacterium also serves as a model organism for studying the mechanisms involved in the control of autotrophic carbon dioxide fixation, hydrogen oxidation and denitrification (Friedrich and Schwartz, 1993; Kusian et al., 1995; Bowien and Kusian, 2002; Gai et al., 2014; Shimizu et al., 2015). A significant amount of studies are devoted to the production of biodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoates in R. eutropha H16, based on different carbon sources (Steinbüchel and Füchtenbusch, 1998; Atlić et al., 2011; Park et al., 2011; Brigham et al., 2012; Kunasundari et al., 2013; Insomphun et al., 2014; Riedel et al., 2014; Hyeon et al., 2015; Saratale and Oh, 2015). The genome of R. eutropha H16 contains a remarkable collection of diverse oxidoreductases. One of the main types of oxidoreductase reactions is performed by dehydrogenases. They catalyze the transfer of hydrides from a substrate to an acceptor or coenzymes, usually NAD+ or NADP+ or a flavin coenzyme like FAD or FMN in an oxidation–reduction reaction. Dehydrogenases have a wide range of possible biotechnological applications. As an example, it was shown that reduction of certain aldehydes in modified strains of R. eutropha H16 can be used for the production of alternative biofuels (Atsumi et al., 2008; Li et al., 2012; Müller et al., 2013; Grousseau et al., 2014; Torella et al., 2015). In addition, the subgroup of short chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) has great potential for stereoselective reduction of ketones and the production of optically pure compounds (e.g. Kroutil et al., 2004; Ni and Xu, 2012). Enantiomerically pure chemicals are essential building blocks for the production of chiral pharmaceuticals, drugs, flavors and agrochemicals (Hummel, 1999; Goldberg et al., 2007; Huisman et al., 2010). In contrast to chemical catalysis, biocatalysts can perform reactions under mild conditions and, thus, do not cause problems with isomerization, racemization, epimerization, and rearrangement of the molecules (Patel, 2008). A further advantage is the high chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivity of the enzymes (Goldberg et al., 2007). There is a variety of approaches for introducing asymmetry using either microbial enzymes or whole cells, respectively, such as kinetic resolution, de-racemization, de-symmetrization reactions or biocatalytic asymmetric synthesis (Wohlgemuth, 2010). Thus, chiral alcohols can be produced by either asymmetric reduction of prochiral ketones or kinetic resolution of racemic alcohols. As a consequence, stereoselective dehydrogenases/reductases are desirable enzymes for biotechnological applications. Up to now, a set of SDRs from yeasts and bacteria have already been applied on an industrial scale for this purpose (Nakamura et al., 2003; Moore et al., 2007; Matsuda et al., 2009; Huisman et al., 2010). Furthermore, asymmetric reduction of ketones was performed in combined reaction systems, where whole cells of R. eutropha H16 were used for a cofactor regeneration (Rundbäck et al., 2012; Oda et al., 2013). The dehydrogenases, which in our opinion are the most interesting, are those which are able to convert ketones with bulky substituents, since only a low number of enzymes is capable of accepting sterically-demanding molecules (Ivan et al., 2008; Lavandera et al., 2008a; Kulig et al., 2012). We have examined the genome of R. eutropha H16 (Schwartz et al., 2003; Pohlmann et al., 2006) in order to reveal SDRs capable of performing reactions which might lead to new industrial processes. These reactions include the oxidation of secondary alcohols, conversion of substrates with sterically demanding residues, and the reduction of long-chain and aromatic ketones or aldehydes. We were able to identify two novel short-chain dehydrogenases originating from R. eutropha H16, which are capable of converting bulky–bulky substrates, such as benzil, with high enantioselectivity."

2,Bacterial strains and plasmids,2.1 Bacterial strains and plasmids Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 .
3,Medium and cultivation conditions,"2.2 Medium and cultivation conditions All chemicals, reagents and basic media components were obtained from Becton, Dickinson and Company (Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), Sigma–Aldrich (St., Luis, MO, USA) and Carl Roth (Arlesheim, Germany), respectively, unless mentioned otherwise. Escherichia coli strains were propagated at 37°C at 120rpm in lysogeny broth (LB). R. eutropha H16 strains were grown at 28°C at 100rpm in tryptic soy broth (TSB) supplemented with 20μg/ml gentamicin. For antibiotic selection kanamycin was added when necessary in a concentration of 40μg/ml for E. coli strains and 200μg/ml for R. eutropha H16 strains. Medium was solidified with 20g/l agar–agar (Carl Roth, Arlesheim, Germany) when needed."
4,Sequence analysis,"2.3 Sequence analysis The Uniprot [http://www.uniprot.org/] and NCBI [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/] databases were used to screen for probable alcohol dehydrogenases and short chain dehydrogenases/reductases of R. eutropha H16. BLAST [http://www.uniprot.org/blast/] was used to search for the proteins that shared homologies. The CDS tool from the NCBI database [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi] was used to search for conserved domains within a protein sequence or protein-coding nucleotide sequence. Multiple sequence alignments were created using the Expresso mode of the T-coffee tool set (Kemena and Notredame, 2009; Di Tommaso et al., 2011). The resulting alignments were visualized with the graphical viewer Jalview 2.8.2 (Waterhouse et al., 2009). The bootstrapped phylogenetic analysis was performed with PHYLIP 3.696 (Felsenstein, 2005). Seqboot was used to produce 1000 new data sets from the original input data, using the delete-half-jackknife resampling method (Wu, 1986). Distance analysis with protdist was followed by the neighbor-joining clustering method (Nei, 1987) using the program neighbor. For both programs, the default parameters, as suggested via the user interface were changed to allow for processing of multiple datasets. The human short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (Uniprot O75911) was used as outgroup for the phylogenetic analysis. The resulting phylogenetic trees were used as input to the consense program. The final tree was visualized and rearranged with the graphical viewer FigTree [http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/]."
5,DNA preparation,"2.4 DNA preparation Standard procedures were used for PCR, DNA preparation and manipulation, as well as genomic DNA isolation (Green and Sambrook, 2012). Restriction enzymes, Fast DNA End Repair Kit, DreamTaq Green DNA Polymerase, Phusion Polymerase and GeneJET Plasmid Miniprep Kits by Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA), T4 DNA Ligation reaction and Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System by Promega TM (Madison, WI, USA) and Easy-DNA Kit by Invitrogen (Carlsbad, California, USA) were used according to the supplier’s protocols. LGC Genomics GmbH (Berlin, Germany) performed the DNA sequencing."
6,Plasmid construction,"2.5 Plasmid construction A putative alcohol dehydrogenase H16_A1168 (SDR A5, UniProt Q0KCG2) and a short chain dehydrogenase H16_B1297 (SDR B3, UniProt Q0K1N7) were amplified from genomic DNA of R. eutropha H16 via PCR and cloned into pK470 vector for expression in E. coli and pKRSF1010-Pj5-cymR vector for expression in R. eutropha H16 via the NdeI and HindIII restriction sites. An additional 20 dehydrogenases originating from R. eutropha H16 were cloned in the same way into the expression vector pK470 (primers and generated expression plasmids are listed in Tables S1 and S2, respectively). To generate N-terminally His6-tagged versions of the enzymes, a double-stranded DNA fragment containing the 6His-tag was prepared by annealing two synthesized oligonucleotides and cloned into expression vectors via the XbaI and NdeI restriction sites. Primers used for the PCR reactions are listed in Table 2 ."
7,Colony assay based on NAD(P)H fluorescence,"2.6 Colony assay based on NAD(P)H fluorescence A colony assay, based on the production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NADH, or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NADPH fluorescence, was performed in order to screen for functional active enzymes (Reisinger et al., 2006). All expression vectors were transferred into competent E. coli BL21 cells via electroporation. Serial dilution of E. coli BL21 overnight cultures harboring the appropriate plasmid were plated out on LBKan agar plates and incubated overnight at 37°C. The plates were replica stamped onto LBKan agar plates containing additional 1% glucose, as well as 0.1mM isopropyl ß-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and incubated at 28°C overnight. Subsequently, the colonies were lifted onto Ø 8.5cm filter paper disks (Whatman International Ltd.; Maidstone, United Kingdom) and air dried for 5min. Dried filters were soaked in 0.1M HEPES buffer pH 8.0 containing 10mM substrate and 5mM NAD(P)+. The tested substrates were (S)-(+)-2-octanol, (R)-(−)-2-octanol, rac-butan-2,3-diol, 2-methyl-propanol, butanol, 3-methyl-butanol and rac-4-methyl-2-pentanol. The increased fluorescence of NAD(P)H was measured using a G:BOX (Syngene; Cambridge, United Kingdom)."
8,Expression and purification of His6-tagged recombinant enzymes,"2.7 Expression and purification of His6-tagged recombinant enzymes The completed constructs were transferred into E. coli BL21 expression strain via standard electroporation procedure. The cultivation was performed in 300ml LB medium supplemented with 1% glucose. The recombinant enzyme expression was initiated by adding 0.1mM IPTG at an OD600 0.6–0.8 and carried out over night at 28°C at 120rpm. Plasmid transfer into R. eutropha H16 was performed via modified triparental conjugative mating procedure (Goldberg and Ohman, 1984) from the donor strain E. coli TOP10, carrying the desirable construct to the recipient strain R. eutropha H16, with the help of the E. coli HB101 [pRK2013] strain. Expression in R. eutropha H16 was performed in TSB medium supplemented with 0.6% fructose. The induction of the enzyme expression in plasmid harboring strains was started at an OD600 1.0 by adding 60μg/ml cumate and cultures were grown over night at 28°C at 100rpm. Following expression, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000rpm at 4°C. Cell disruption was performed via sonification in 50mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4. After centrifugation at 20000rpm at 4°C for 1h, clear lysates were used for the enzyme activity assays or for purification (therefore, the cells were resuspended in 50mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with 0.5mM NaCl and 20mM imidazole). Protein purification was performed on the basis of PD10 desalting columns (GE Healthcare, UK Limited, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK), prepacked with Ni Sepharose™ Fast Flow (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden), according to the manufacturer’s protocols. For the purification 20mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with 0.5M NaCl was used with additionally added 20, 30 and 100mM imidazole in the binding, washing and elution steps, respectively. After purification the buffer was exchanged against 20mM TrisCl and 0.2M NaCl storage buffer pH 7.4 via PD10 desalting columns. The amount of total protein in the lysate and the concentration of purified enzymes were determined according to the Bradford procedure using Protein Assay Dying Reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.; Hercules USA) and bovine serum albumin served as a standard. SDS PAGE analysis was performed using 10% Tris–glycine SDS–polyacrylamide gels. For the molecular weight estimation of the proteins, PageRuler™ Prestained Protein Ladder (10–170kDa) (Thermo Science Inc., Waltham; USA) was applied. After electrophoresis the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue solution."
9,Enzyme activity assays,"2.8 Enzyme activity assays The enzyme activity was determined by a NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H dependent spectrophotometric assay. The light absorbance at 340nm was monitored over 20min, using the Synergy Mx Monochromator-Based Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments GmbH; Bad Friedrichshall, Germany). The reaction mixture for the reduction reaction included 1mM substrate, 50mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 0.02mg of purified protein and 0.5mM NAD(P)H. For the oxidation reaction 1mM substrate, 50mM sodium carbonate–bicarbonate buffer, pH 10.5, 0.01mg of protein and 0.5mM NAD(P)+ was used. Three different types of controls were used. Therefore, the protein, substrate or cofactor aliquot in the mixture was replaced by reaction buffer. All measurements were biologically and technically performed in triplicates. Based on the absorbance data, the linear range of change in absorbance over time was taken into account for the calculation of enzyme activity unit, which was defined as the amount of enzyme producing 1μmol of NAD(P)(H) per minute. Enzyme activity was expressed as units per mg of protein. To determine the substrate scope of the SDR A5 and SDR B3 all substrates given in Fig. 1 were tested. For pH range studies the following 50mM buffers were used: citrate buffer pH 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5; sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0; Tris–HCl buffer pH 8.0, 8.5, 9.0; sodium carbonate–bicarbonate buffer pH 9.5, 10.5, 11.0. Measurements of oxidation and reduction reaction were performed at 40°C using (S)-(+)-2-octanol and hexane-3,4-dione as a substrate, respectively. To determine the optimum temperature, oxidation studies were performed over 20min using the Cary 100 UV–vis spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies; Santa Clara, CA, USA) at the temperatures 20°C, 30°C, 40°C, 50°C, 60°C and 70°C. Measurements were performed in 50mM sodium carbonate–bicarbonate buffer, pH 10.5, with (S)-(+)-2-octanol as a substrate."
10,Determination of stereoselectivity and kinetic parameters,"2.9 Determination of stereoselectivity and kinetic parameters The reaction mixture included 0.2mg of the purified protein SDR A5 or SDR B3, 10mM benzil (dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)) and 5mM NADPH (dissolved in ddH2O) in sodium phosphate reaction buffer (50mM pH 6.5). The total reaction volume was 1ml. In the control reaction, the protein was replaced by the respective volume of the reaction buffer. The reaction proceeded at 38°C in a thermomixer at 400rpm for 3h. For a detailed determination of enantioselectivity with the substrate benzil the following approach was made: The reaction mixture (total volume 0.5mL) contained 5mM 4-methoxyphenol (dissolved in DMSO) which served as an internal standard, 0.2mg of the purified protein SDR A5 or SDR B3, 5 or 0.5mM benzil (dissolved in DMSO) and 5 or 0.5mM NADPH (dissolved in ddH2O) in 50mM sodium phosphate reaction buffer pH 6.5. In the control reaction, the protein was replaced by the corresponding volume of reaction buffer. The conditions were optimized and the reactions were finally run at 30°C in a thermomixer at 400rpm for 30min or 3h, respectively. The products were extracted with a mixture of n-heptane and isopropanol isopropanol (90:10, v/v) and analyzed with a HPLC system from Agilent Technologies 1100 Series System (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) using a Chiralpack AD-H analytical column (particle size 5μm, 250mm×4,6mm; Daicel Chemical Industry, Japan) with an isocratic eluent n-heptane/isopropanol (90:10). The data were analyzed with the Agilent ChemStation software (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). Retention times for benzil, (R)-benzoin and (S)-benzoin were 8.1min, 23.9min and 33.4min, respectively. Kinetic parameters for the oxidation of (S)-(+)-2-octanol were determined by initial rate activity measurements in triplicate, with various substrate concentrations (0.05mM, 0.1mM, 0.2mM, 1mM, 2mM, 5mM and 10mM) and 0.5mM NADP+ in 50mM sodium carbonate–bicarbonate buffer pH 10.0. The absorbance at 340nm was monitored over 10min at 40°C, using the Synergy Mx Monochromator-Based Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments GmbH; Bad Friedrichshall, Germany). Experimental data were analysed and kinetic parameters (V max,K M) were calculated with Origin 7 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton)."
11,Results and discussion,
12,Screening of the dehydrogenases potentially applicable in biotechnology,"3.1 Screening of the dehydrogenases potentially applicable in biotechnology An examination of the publicly accessible sequence databases revealed around 400 potential dehydrogenases in the R. eutrophas genome. Based on the BLAST results, conserved domain searches and structures of the proteins, 11 alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) and 11 short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) were selected, cloned and expressed in E. coli BL21 (see Fig. 1). The initial screening for functional enzymes was performed by direct visualization of the activity of the enzymes expressed in bacterial colonies. Fluorescence of different intensity was observed for E. coli BL21 cells with heterologously expressed dehydrogenases and tested with different substrates. An example of this assay is shown in Fig. 1. A number of dehydrogenases found to be active towards the tested alcohols is listed in Table 3 . As it can be seen, the most promising enzyme candidates were ADH A4, SDR A1, SDR A5 and SDR B3. Accordingly, an N-terminally 6His-tagged version of these proteins was produced in E. coli BL21, purified and characterized for their oxidizing and reducing activity. In accordance with the results of the colony-based assay, SDR B3 and SDR A5 showed the best activities and were homologously overexpressed in R. eutropha H16 in order to provide optimal functional expression conditions (Fig. S1). Subsequently, they were purified and further characterized with respect to biochemical properties, substrate range and stereoselectivity. The results of the spectrophotometric assay revealed a preference for NADP+/NADPH as cofactor, which is especially pronounced for SDR B3. The cofactor specificity is attributed to certain amino acid positions in the cofactor-binding site of the enzyme. Altogether, a positively charged environment correlates with phosphorylated cofactor preference (Tanaka et al., 1996). NADP(H) preference is caused by the presence of basic residues, arginine or lysine, in the TGxxxGxG cofactor binding motif and/or at the C-terminal end of the second β-sheet (Tanaka et al., 1996; Persson et al., 2003). Depending on the distribution of these residues in given positions, classical SDRs can be divided into three subfamilies. SDRs of the cP1 subfamily show only one arginine or lysine in the cofactor binding glycine rich domain, members belonging to the cP2 subfamily show an Arg or Lys at the beginning of the second β-sheet, and cP3 SDRs possess positively charged arginine or lysine both in Gly-rich motif and at the beginning of second β-sheet. SDR B3 is a member of cP2 subfamily and SDR A5 belongs to the cP3 subfamily (see Fig. 2 ). According to the results of the colony-based assay, SDRs B3 and A5 accept both cofactors (NAD+ and NADP+) in a similar manner. However, purified enzymes showed strong preference for the phosphorylated form of the cofactor. This may be explained due to the activity of the NAD kinase, which is present in E. coli BL21 cells. Cellular NADP+ in living organisms is produced de novo through the phosphorylation of NAD+ by NAD kinase, and this enzyme can be found ubiquitously, from bacteria to human cells (Kawai et al., 2001). From the biotechnological point of view, NAD(H) is of greater interest than NADP(H) because of lower costs. To overcome this problem, NAD kinase can be used to increase the amount of available NADP+ from the NAD+ moiety/pool. For example, Li et al. (Li et al., 2009) employed this enzyme to increase the NADP+ concentration using intracellular NAD+ and thus improved NADP+-dependent PHB production in recombinant E. coli harboring the PHB synthesis pathway from R. eutropha."
13,Biochemical properties of SDR B3 and SDR A5,"3.2 Biochemical properties of SDR B3 and SDR A5 3.2.1 (a) pH optimum Pyridine nucleotide-dependent dehydrogenase reactions have different pH optima, when catalyzing the oxidation (alkaline) or reduction (neutral) of carbonyl compounds. As shown in Fig. 3 , the pH optima for the activity of SDR B3 and SDR A5 show a similar pattern. The highest oxidation activities for SDR B3 and SDR A5 were detected at pH 11.0 (Fig. 3B and D). However, the enzymes are not stable at extreme alkaline conditions. For instance, after 3h of incubation at pH 11.0, the activity of SDR A5 was decreased fourfold (data not shown). For SDR A5, the optimal pH-value for the reduction activity is 6.5 (Fig. 3C). For SDR B3, the favorable pH range for the reduction is within the range of 6–7.5 and therefore slightly broader (Fig. 3A). In contrast to the alkaline conditions, the reducing activity of the enzymes, which were kept at pH 6.5 for 3h did not decrease significantly and showed an activity lowered by only one third, in comparison with the initial activity (data not shown). This can be explained by the fact that pH parameters of the reaction buffer did not differ substantially from the pH of the storage buffer, which were 7.5 for both of enzymes. Additionally, we have determined that the chemical composition of the buffer influences the reducing activity of SDR B3. All measurements in Tris–HCl buffer demonstrated lower activities, when compared to those performed in sodium phosphate or carbonate–bicarbonate buffers at the same pH. The same observations have already been reported by Kulig et al. for an alcohol dehydrogenase from Ralstonia sp. (Kulig et al., 2013). This may be explained by the destabilization effect of Tris–Cl buffer components on the protein structure (Ugwu and Apte, 2004). 3.2.2 (b) Temperature optimum The influence of temperature on the enzyme activity was tested for the oxidation reaction between 20 and 70°C. The highest activity for SDR B3 was detected at 40°C (Fig. 4 A). The enzyme kept more than 60% of its relative activity within a broad temperature range from approximately 25° to 65°C. SDR A5 had a narrower temperature interval to keep 60% of its relative activity, which is between 30° and 60°C and showed the best activity between 40° and 50°C (Fig. 4B). For both enzymes, the activity at 20°C dropped two-fold in comparison to the activity at the optimum temperature. In general, SDR A5 and SDR B3 showed the same optimum temperatures as described previously for dehydrogenases originating from Ralstonia sp. (Zarnt et al., 1997; Kulig et al., 2013)."
14,Substrate range and stereoselectivity for oxidation activity of SDR B3 and SDR A5,"3.3 Substrate range and stereoselectivity for oxidation activity of SDR B3 and SDR A5 55 different substrates (Fig. 5 ) were tested for oxidation and reduction activity of SDR B3 and A5. In the oxidation pathway of the reaction, both enzymes showed preference toward secondary long-chain aliphatic alcohols or secondary alcohols with phenyl as a substituent (Fig. 6 ), respectively. Both of the enzymes showed high preference for such substrates as (S)-(+)-2-octanol, (S)-(+)-4-phenyl-2-butanol and (S)-(+)-hexanol. Activity of SDR A5 toward (S)-(+)-4-phenyl-2-butanol is significantly higher compared to the activity with the racemic mixture (Fig. 6A) indicating preference for the S- enantiomer. In contrast, activity of SDR B3 toward (S)-(+)-4-phenyl-2-butanol and toward rac-4-phenyl-2-butanol is at the same level, indicating no significant stereopreference (Fig. 6B). Additionally, SDRs A5 and B3 react with (S)-(−)-1-phenylethanol and 1-phenyl-2-propanol. No activity could be detected with the R- enantiomers. The obtained results demonstrate that both enzymes are specific for S- enantiomers. SDR B3 is able to convert a broader range of substrates compared to SDR A5 and shows also higher activities with nearly all of the tested substrates. However, the highest oxidation activity was detected for SDR A5 in the reaction with (S)-(+)-2-octanol, as shown in Fig. 6, where 100% relative activity refers to 1.2U/mg activity under the tested conditions. (S)-(+)-2-octanol was among the best substrates for SDR B3, with a detected activity of 640 mU/mg, although the highest activity for this enzyme was detected in the reaction with (S)-(−)-1-phenylethanol and the calculated activity under the given conditions was 870mU/mg. According to the literature, several microbial enzymes capable of producing different 1-phenylethanol enantiomers have been described up to now while only three of them were characterized as 1-phenylethanol dehydrogenases (Peters et al., 1993; Hummel, 1999, 1997; Itoh et al., 1997; Kniemeyer and Heider, 2001; Makino et al., 2005; Höffken et al., 2006; Rulli et al., 2013; Dudzik et al., 2015). Secondary alcohol dehydrogenases are of interest in biotechnology for their ability to produce optically active molecules. Enzymes with a preference for long-chain alcohols, or alcohols with bulky aromatic substituents, are especially valuable and a number of them have already been characterized and used for enantioselective bioconversion of secondary alcohols (e.g., Ludwig et al., 1995; Kroutil et al., 2004; Musa et al., 2007; Lavandera et al., 2008a,b; Kern et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2013). The corresponding ketones, which were obtained as products in the oxidation reactions were also used as substrates to test SDRs A5 and B3 for their reduction activity in the reverse reactions. Our results showed weak activity for SDR A5 and almost no activity for SDR B3 with ketones such as 2-octanone, benzylacetone, 2-hexanone and acetophenone (Fig. 7 ). In general, oxidoreductase reactions are reversible for most of the alcohol dehydrogenases; however, in case of poor substrate affinity, only one way of the reaction might be favored."
15,Substrate range and stereoselectivity for reduction activity of SDR B3 and SDR A5,"3.4 Substrate range and stereoselectivity for reduction activity of SDR B3 and SDR A5 SDR A5 and SDR B3 were checked for reduction activity with 28 substrates (Fig. 5B). As expected, the tendency to convert long-chain or bulky substrates remains in the reduction pathway of the reaction. Interestingly, the most sterically demanding molecule, benzil, was found to be the best substrate for SDR B3 and was converted more than five times better than octanal, which is the second best substrate for SDR B3 (Fig. 7). 100% of the relative activity shown in Fig. 7 corresponds to 1.8U/mg of activity for SDR B3 with benzil; this is more than ten times higher than the 150mU/mg of activity detected for SDR A5 with the same substrate under the tested conditions. Additional substrates accepted by SDR B3 were octanal, diketones hexane-3,4-dione and butane-2,3-dione, bulky aldehyde 2-phenylacetaldehyde and bulky ketone propiophenone. SDR A5 also accepted all of these molecules, except 2-phenylacetaldehyde, although with a lower efficiency. In addition, SDR A5 is able to convert the bulky ketone 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone. The optimal substrate for SDR A5 was shown to be hexane-3,4-dione with an activity of 180mU/mg under the tested conditions. As benzil is an interesting substrate for biocatalytic applications and both enzymes showed high activity with the substrate benzil, a comprehensive analysis with regard to stereoselectivity was performed. The results showed that biotransformations of SDRs A5 and B3 with benzil are highly stereoselective. According to the results of HPLC experiments, purified enzymes transform benzil to (S)-benzoin with enantiomeric excess of 96% for SDR B3 and >99% for SDR A5. In additional experiments performed at lower substrate concentration and lower reaction temperature, no (R)-benzoin product was detected for any of the two SDRs (Table 4 ) giving >99% ee (S). Absence of (R)-benzoin as a product in the reaction with SDR B3 in comparison to previously performed experiments can be explained by the different initial substrate concentration. The analysis of low product concentrations requires high sensitivity of the system. Therefore, (R)-benzoin might not be visible enough in this case. Reduction of benzil by SDR B3 is fast and reached 88% conversion already after 30min, with an initial substrate concentration of 5mM (Table 4). Longer incubation time leads to almost no change of the product yield. Maximum conversion of benzil by SDR A5 was shown to be 63% after 3h with the initial substrate concentration 0.5mM. In contrast to the results obtained for SDR B3, the activity of SDH A5 is negatively influenced by higher substrate concentration (5mM) leading to only 12% conversion after 30min. Both of the enzymes are only effective in the reduction reaction, since neither SDR A5, nor SDR B3, were able to oxidize racemic benzoin. The reduction of dicarbonyl compounds, like benzil, is a current topic in biotechnology. Enantiopure benzoins are valuable intermediates for pharmaceuticals and useful chiral auxiliary reagents in stereoselective organic synthesis (Pal et al., 2015). Benzil is a diketone, which is widely environmentally distributed. It has been shown in experiments with whole cells that different microorganisms are capable of benzil transformation (Hoyos et al., 2010). In 2001 R. Maruyama et al. reported for the first time the isolation and expression of benzil reductase originating from Bacillus cereus (Maruyama et al., 2001). Only a few novel benzil reductases have thus far been characterized in more detail (Maruyama et al., 2002; Pennacchio et al., 2013). SDR A5, in contrast to SDR B3, is also capable of reducing the second carbonyl group of benzil. It accepts benzoin as a substrate, although SDR A5 converts it with a lower efficiency than benzil. As for all tested secondary alcohols, it operates only on the S- enantiomer of the benzoin molecule, as no reaction was detected for SDR A5 with R-(−)-benzoin. To summarize, SDR A5 shows the highest activities in the oxidation pathway of the reaction, while it accepts a relative small number of substrates when compared to the reduction pathway of the reaction, where it accepts a larger number of substrates, while showing only lower activities. In the case of SDR B3, the range of oxidized substrates is wider, with relatively low activities, whereas the reducing activity is high with a narrow substrate range. The accurate determination of the kinetic parameters for the reduction of benzil was not successful due to the limited solubility of the substrate. An example of the corresponding V/[S] plot is given in Fig. 2S. Instead, kinetic data for SDR A5 and SDR B3 were gained in the oxidation way of reaction, with one of the best converted substrates, (S)-(+)-2-octanol (Table 5 ). The specificity constant (k cat/K M) for SDR A5 is 1.8mMs−1 which is three times higher than k cat/K M obtained for SDR B3. Sterically demanding molecules are poorly accepted by most of the enzymes. Novel enzymes able to transform bulky–bulky substrates are always desirable targets (Kroutil et al., 2004). On the basis of the performed experiments, it can be concluded that SDR A5 and B3 are (S)-stereoselective oxidoreductases, with a preference to sterically demanding alcohols, aldehydes or ketones. Therefore, they are among those very rare enzymes that can be used for the production of bulky chiral compounds."
16,Computational analysis of SDRs A5 and B3 in relationship with the enzymes with known benzil reduction activity,"3.5 Computational analysis of SDRs A5 and B3 in relationship with the enzymes with known benzil reduction activity Up to now, several enzymes have been reported to show benzil-reduction activity. (S)-benzoin-forming benzil reductases from B. cereus, B. subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Uniprot Q8RJB2, O32099 and P40580, respectively) were isolated by R. Maruyama et al. (Maruyama et al., 2002, 2001). Additionally, a SDR from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (Uniprot Q4J9F2) was highly active in the anti-Prelog reduction of benzil (Pennacchio et al., 2013). Two mammalian sepiapterin reductases (Uniprot P18297 and Q8R536) were also shown to exhibit benzil reduction activity (Citron et al., 1990; Maruyama et al., 2002; respectively), as well as an alternatively spliced isoform of human NADP(H)-dependent retinol dehydrogenase/reductase (Uniprot Q9BTZ2) (Yan et al., 2012). Sequences of all listed enzymes and SDRs A5 and B3 were aligned and, subsequently, phylogenetic trees were built using a Neighbor-Joining Distance Bootstrapping algorithm (Fig. 8 ). Additionally a few enzymes with high sequence identity to SDR A5, SDR B3 and sepiapterine reductase P18297 were added in order to increase significance of the phylogenetic tree. As a result, two distinct groups can be inferred in the evolution of the observed benzil reductases. Most of the enzymes capable of reducing benzil, including the one with the highest activity (Q8R536), are grouped together with SDR A5, as shown in red (Fig. 8). Interestingly, SDR B3, which in our study was the most active enzyme with benzil, clearly maps into a different cluster within the phylogenetic tree (marked in green in Fig. 8). Only two more enzymes showing relatively low or average benzil reduction activity are located in the same group in our study (Q4J9F2 and Q9BTZ2)."
17,Conclusion,"In this study we have characterized two novel short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases originating from the Gram-negative bacterium R. eutropha H16. The two enzymes are (S)-stereoselective and operate on long-chain and bulky aromatic substrates. Additionally, through computational analysis of all enzymes with proven benzil reduction activity, we concluded that SDR A5 and B3 belong to different evolutionary lineages. To summarize, preference for bulky substrates, good stereoselectivity and one-way reaction behavior make SDR A5 and SDR B3 good candidates for the production of chiral compounds. Therefore these novel characterized enzymes are among those very rare ones that can be applied for the biotechnological production of highly valuable bulky chiral compounds."
