0,Introduction,"Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) have attracted considerable attention because of their applications in flexible electronics [1–3]. Solution-processes including various printing technologies have been intensively studied to realize low-cost electronic circuits on flexible substrates [4,5]. Gate dielectric layer is a key component of OFETs. The gate dielectrics in the solution processed flexible OFETs should have good insulating and pattern-forming properties just like dielectrics in conventional thin-film transistors. However, solution processes and flexible substrates have given rise to a series of new requirements, such as solvent resistance of the thin-films and compatibility of process with plastic substrates [6,7]. Polymers have been considered as promising materials for gate dielectrics because of their good film-forming properties, interfacial compatibility with organic semiconductors, and low temperature solution processing [8]. However, they have several inherent disadvantages, such as small dielectric constant, large electrical leakage and low solvent stability. The solvent resistance and electrical robustness can be improved by photo or thermal cross-linking processes in solid states [9–12].The search for polymers with high dielectric constants for gate insulators has become active research area, recently [13–15]. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) has relatively large dielectric constant among polymers. It is a petroleum-based synthetic material with the properties of a ‘green polymer’. PVA thin-films are nontoxic, odorless, optically clear, biodegradable and biocompatible, and tough with high tensile and abrasion resistance [16,17]. These are desirable properties of thin-films for applications in wearable electronic devices. PVA is also the most commercially important water soluble plastic. So far, various organic solvents are used in fabrication of OFETs. In light of increasing stringent environmental regulation, organic solvents, especially halogenated and/or aromatic solvents are unlikely viable choices for large scale production of organic electronics. PVA is attractive material for gate dielectric applications also because of its good film-forming and water-processable features [18]. However, its applications as gate dielectrics are limited so far. The fundamental drawback of PVA thin-films are high electrical leakage and surface polar/hydrophilic (hydroxyl) groups which prevent the proper growth of organic semiconducting layers and induce energetic disorder and charge traps at the dielectric/semiconductor interface [19]. The PVA thin-films have often been cross-linked with ammonium dichromate (ADC) in electronic industry [20,21]. Several chromium free methods also have been reported for the cross-linking of PVA gate dielectrics to reduce their electrical leakage, recently [22,23]. However, efficient methods for crosslinking of PVA thin-films in a controlled manner and with high dielectric performances are still needed. Some surface treatment have been developed to improve dielectric performances of PVA thin-films [24–27]. Among these, hydrophobic polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) buffer layer are often used for the modification of hydrophilic PVA surface to improve the dielectric/semiconductor interface [28,29]. However, the feasibility of solution processing has become an issue in those approaches. Herein, we reported a new PVA gate dielectric cross-linked by N,N’-methylene bisacrylamide (MBA) in a thermal induced radical process. The effect of cross-link on the dielectric properties of thin-films was investigated. A thin layer of photo cross-linked PMMA was inserted into the dielectric/semiconductor interface to reduce surface polarity and to overcome PVA’s susceptibility to moisture absorbance and degradation. The surface passivation on the electrical properties and the surface characteristics of PVA dielectrics were studied. The cross-linked bilayer dielectrics were applied in fully solution processed OFET devices with a bottom-gate bottom-contact (BGBC) structure (Fig. 1 ). The performances of the new materials as a gate dielectric in OFET devices were presented."

Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, MW = 89,000–98,000 g mol1, 99+% hydrolyzed), polystyrene (PS, MW = 560,000 g mol1) and N,N’-methylene bisacrylamide (MBA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ammonium persulphate (APS) was obtained from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China). Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA, MW = 120,000 g mol1) was supplied by TCI. The cross-linker BBP-4 was synthesized according to the procedure reported in literature [30]. 6,13-Bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)-pentacene (TIPS-pentacene) was provided by Merck."
3,Preparation and characterization of polymer thin-films,"2.2 Preparation and characterization of polymer thin-films PVA (80.0 mg) was dissolved in deionized water (2.0 mL) and was stirred at 90℃ for 1 h. After the solution was cooled to room temperature, initiator APS (0.4 mg, 0.5 wt% to PVA) and crosslinking agent MBA (8.0 mg) were added, and the solution was stirred again for 12 h. The solution was spin-coated on a bare silicon wafer at 3000 rpm for 60 s. The thin-films were cross-linked on a hot plate at 100℃ in air for 30 min. The PVA films were studied by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer Spectrum 100) before and after thermal cross-linking reactions. The degree of swelling (S) of the thin-films were determined by the following Eq. (1): (1) S = m 1 − m 0 m 0 × 100 % where m1 and m0 are the weights of wet and dry films, respectively. The dielectric characteristics of cross-linked PVA dielectric films were studied in a capacitor device with Ag/C-PVA/Ag sandwich configuration. The bottom silver electrode was formed on a glass substrate by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask. The cross-linked PVA dielectric layer was formed as described before. The thermal cross-linked polymer dielectric film was rinsed with deionized water to remove any water soluble materials and the film was annealed at 100℃ in air. The capacitor devices were completed with deposition of the top silver electrode by evaporation. The dielectric characteristics of the MIM device were measured with a Keithley 4200 and WK6515B precision impedance analyzer in the dark under ambient air. The film thickness and surface morphologies of the dielectric layers were studied by an atomic force microscope (AFM). (BioScope Veeco)."
4,OFET device fabrication and characterization,"2.3 OFET device fabrication and characterization The cross-linkable PVA dielectrics were applied in OFET devices with bottom-gate/bottom-contact (BGBC) configuration. Nine devices were fabricated and tested for each type of dielectric layers. Glass substrates (2 cm × 2 cm) were cleaned successively in an ultrasonic bath with deionized water, acetone, iso-propanol and were dried. Silver gate electrode (40 nm) was formed on the glass substrate by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask. The cross-linked PVA dielectric layer was formed as described before. The thermal cross-linking polymer dielectric layer was rinsed with deionized water and the thin-film was annealed at 100℃ in air. The silver (Ag) source/drain (S/D) electrodes were thermally evaporated and their dimensions were defined via a shadow mask with a channel width of 1200 μm and a channel length of 60 μm. The electrodes were treated with per-fluorobenzenethiol (5 × 10−3 mol L−1 in ethanol) for 15 min, and were rinsed with ethanol [31]. The semiconductor layer was dip-coated from a blended solution of TIPS-pentacene (10 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) and PS solution (10 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) at 3:1 vol ratio [32,33]. The semiconductor layer was annealed at 100 ℃ on a hot plate in air for 30 min to remove the solvent and to achieve high crystallinity. The OFET devices with cross-linked PMMA buffer layer on PVA dielectric layer were fabricated. The blended solutions of PMMA and photo cross-linker BBP-4 (10:1 ratio by mass) in chlorobenzene with concentrations of 10.0 mg/mL were spin-coated on the cross-linked PVA layer at 3000 rpm. The thin PMMA layer was cross-linked by photo-crosslinking with a LED-UV lamp (λ =365 nm) with photo exposure energy 10,542 mJ cm−2/min [30]. The thickness of PMMA buffer layer was around 50 nm. The contact angles of the PVA films and the PMMA buffer layer modified PVA films were measured at room temperature with a sessile drop method on a dynamic contact angle measurement instrument. The morphologies of dielectric films and TIPS-pentacene films were characterized with a Bio Scope Veeco atomic force microscope (AFM). The out-of-plane X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of TIPS-pentacene on different dielectrics were obtained by an X-ray diffractometer. The polarized optical microscopy (POM) images of TIPS-pentacene on dielectric layers were taken by a XPF-300C microscope. The output and transfer characteristic curves of the OFETs were measured in ambient air on a Keithley 4200 semiconductor parameter analyzer. The field effect mobility in the saturation region was extracted from the highest slope of I D 1/2 vs. V GS according to the Eq. (2): (2) I D = W 2 L μ C i ( V G − V th ) 2 where I D is the drain current in the saturated regime, W and L are the width and length of the channel, respectively, Ci is the capacitance of the dielectric film, V G is the gate voltage, V th is the threshold voltage, and μ is the mobility."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Thermal cross-linking of PVA thin-films,"3.1 Thermal cross-linking of PVA thin-films The thin-films were formed by spin-coating an aqueous solution of PVA, initiator APS and crosslinking agent MBA on bare silicon wafers. The thermal cross-linking reactions were carried out in solid state thin-films placed on a hot plate at 100℃. Radicals were generated from peroxydisulfate upon heating and they could undergo hydrogen abstraction reactions with hydrogen donors, such as CH groups in PVA polymers, α-hydrogens to the alcohol groups due to the formation of relatively stable macro-radicals. These macro-radicals can initiate various crosslinking reactions such as radical coupling and reactions with crosslinking agent MBA. (Fig. 1b) The ATR-FTIR spectra of pristine and cross-linked PVA (C-PVA) thin-films are shown in Fig. 2 . The peaks in the range of 1620˜1655 cm−1 were disappeared after heating at 100 °C for 0.5 h. They were attributed to the vibrations of carbon-carbon double bonds on the acrylamide of the crosslinking agent MBA. This change indicated that the double bonds of MBAs were consumed. The solubility and degree of swelling of PVA thin-films with different cross-linker contents and curing time at 100℃ were studied (Table S1). The low swelling degree of C-PVA compared with that of PVA was attributed to reducing free volume due to crosslinking. When the cross-linker (MBA) 10% wt was used, PVA dielectric films with good solvent resistant and low swelling degree can be obtained within 0.5 h. Hence, cross-linker of 10 wt%, curing time of 0.5 h and curing temperature of 100℃ were chosen as a typical thermal cross-linking condition for the PVA dielectric layer. The solvent resistance of C-PVA is summarized in Table S2. The pristine PVA films re-dissolved or peeled off from substrates within five minutes at room temperature after samples were soaked in solvents such as water, DMSO and ethanolamine, whereas the cross-linked films were robust even after ultra-sonication in these solvents. The optical micrographs of the pristine and cross-linked polymer films before and after soaking in water are shown in Fig. S1. The water contact angles of pristine PVA and C-PVA films are shown in Fig. S2. The samples with C-PVA films showed negligible change on contact angle after water immersing. In contrast, the samples with pristine PVA films showed significant changes after water immersing. It approached to the contact angle of bare substrate. The results also suggested that PVA films could be cross-linked effectively to achieve solvent resistance by current methods. The thermal cross-linked PVA films showed uniform and smooth surface from AFM studied (Fig. 3 b). The root-mean-square (RMS) value was 0.34 nm. 3.1.1 Dielectric characteristics of the C-PVA thin-films The dielectric properties of the cross-linked films were evaluated in capacitor devices. The dielectric films were sandwiched between two silver electrodes. The active area of the MIM device was 1.96 mm2. The frequency dependencies of the capacitance and phase angle are shown in Fig. 3c, and the results are summarized in Table 1 . The capacitance per unit area is given by Eq. (3): (3) C = k ε 0 / d where k is the dielectric constant, d is the material thickness, and ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant. The formula indicates that the capacitance magnitude depends on k and d. The permittivities of PVA and C-PVA gate dielectrics were 6.34 and 6.30 at 1 kHz calculated by Eq. (3). The phase angle of C-PVA thin-film was relatively unaffected with increasing of the frequency up to 106 Hz. The phase angle of the pristine PVA thin-film was varied with frequencies. This was consistent with the early report [34]. The dielectric strength of pristine PVA and C-PVA dielectric thin-films were studied. The leakage current density versus electrical-field (I-E) plot is displayed in Fig. 3a and b. The C-PVA thin-films showed low leakage current density (below 10−9A/cm2 at 1 MV/cm)) and high breakdown fields (larger than 2 MV/cm). The pristine PVA thin-films showed leakage current density larger than 10-4A/cm2 at 1 MV/cm. Significant improvement on dielectric properties were achieved by cross-linking. The leakage currents of the PVA thin-films cross-linked with current method were compared with some known cross-linked PVA dielectrics (Table 2 ). The C-PVA thin-films derived from current method showed the relatively high dielectric breakdown field and low leakage current at comparable film thickness. The capacitance and leakage current are main electrical characteristics for gate dielectrics. The capacitance of gate dielectrics plays an important role in determining the number of charge carriers, and the low leakage current can improve the transistor parameter, on/off ratio. High capacitance and low leakage current are desirable properties for gate dielectrics."
7,Fabrication and performance of OFET devices,"3.2 Fabrication and performance of OFET devices The bottom-gate bottom-contact (BGBC) OFET device geometry was used in electrical characterizations (Fig. 1a). The transfer and output characteristics are shown in Fig. 4 . The key device parameters are summarized in Table 3 . The transfer characteristics displayed a steep current increase in the sub-threshold region with low gate leakage current (IGS < 1.0 × 10−9A), and the output characteristics showed good linear-saturation behavior. The devices with TIPS-pentacene as semiconductor and C-PVA as gate dielectric showed average carrier mobility of 0.15 cm2V-1s-1, and a maximum value was 0.17 cm2V-1s-1, an average ON/OFF ratio of 9.0 × 103. Moreover, the OFET devices were operated at a voltage of -5.0 V. The high dielectric constant and small thickness of the C-PVA films contributed to the low voltage operation. The devices with pristine PVA as dielectric layers all failed due to large leakage current in controlled experiment (Fig. S3). The sub-gap density of states (DOS) at the channel (N ss) is calculated with the following equation [38]: (4) S S = ln 10 ⋅ k B T q ⋅ 1 + q 2 N SS C G where k B is the Boltzman’s constant, T is the absolute temperature, q is the elementary charge, and C G is the specific gate dielectric capacitance per unit area. The SS (180 mV decade−1) and Nss (2.83 × 1011 eV-1 cm-2) of the devices were calculated according to the equation. The surface properties such as roughness and surface energy of dielectric layers can affect the morphology of semiconductor layer and play key roles in the charge transport [39,40]. The hydroxyl groups on the semiconductor/insulator interface could result in poor device performances because they could trap charge carriers and result in device instability and low ON/OFF ratio [41]. A cross-linked PMMA (C-PMMA) buffer layer (about 50 nm) was inserted between the C-PVA dielectric layer and TIPS-pentacene layer for the improvement of interface characteristics [30]. The water contact angles of the double layered dielectric surface were measured. The PMMA modified dielectric surface became much hydrophobic (contact angle about 82°). It has been considered that the hydrophobic surface is more favorable for growth of TIPS-pentacene grain than hydrophilic surface. The dielectric characteristic and surface morphology of C-PVA/C-PMMA double layer dielectric are shown in Table S3 and Fig. S4. The surface morphologies of C-PMMA layer before and after soaking into chlorobenzene are shown in Fig. S5. The cross-linked PMMA demonstrated good solvent resistance. The output and transfer characteristics of the OFET devices based on double layer dielectrics are shown in Fig. 4. The transfer characteristic showed the typical I–V behavior. The off-current was reduced and the on-current was increased compared with those in OFET devices with C-PVA as dielectric layer. The off-current reduction likely was due to the favorable dielectric/semiconductor interface, which led to the low interfacial trapping state density [42]. The OFETs with C-PVA/C-PMMA double layered dielectrics showed average carrier mobility of 0.43 cm2V−1s−1, and a maximum value was 0.61 cm2V-1s-1. Furthermore, the ON/OFF ratios of devices based on double layered dielectrics were improved compared with the OFET devices with single C-PVA layer. The improvements were ascribed to the reducing charge trap density at insulator and semiconductor interface and the increasing crystallinity of TIPS-pentacene. The devices with double layered C-PVA/C-PMMA dielectric exhibited significantly decreased SS (average 130 mV decade−1). The output curves displayed good linear saturation behavior. The double layered insulator devices also yielded noticeable enhancement on drain current. These results demonstrated that a thin layer of cross-linked PMMA can effectively passivate the hydroxyl groups on the PVA surface and eliminate the surface traps on the PVA thin-films. The electrical performances of the OFETs depend on the surface morphology of the active layer. The crystallinities of the semi-conductor layers were studied by AFM, polarized optical microscopy (POM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The surface morphologies of TIPS-pentacene grown on dielectrics along the channel are shown in Fig. 5 a and b. The crystal size of active layer grown on the C-PVA/C-PMMA dielectric was much larger than that on the C-PVA film. As the polar surface of PVA was covered with the hydrophobic PMMA film, the reduction of interface polarity resulted in improved crystallinities in semiconductor layer. The well-ordered and millimeter-sized crystalline grains along the channel were achieved on the dielectrics. Furthermore, the polarized optical microscope images also showed crystalline texture of semiconductor layer (Fig. S6) [43]. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of TIPS-pentacene films grown on gate dielectrics are shown in Fig. 5c. The XRD curves showed strong and sharp peaks at about 2θ＝5.3°, as indicated by the intense (001) peaks [44]. The diffraction peaks of TIPS-pentacene grown on bilayer C-PVA/C-PMMA was strong compared with the peaks of TIPS-pentacene grown on the single layer C-PVA. These results suggested that the combination of the high-k PVA dielectrics with an ultra-thin low-k PMMA buffer layer could lead to better OFET performances."
8,Conclusions,"PVA thin-films were cross-linked by N,N’-methylene bisacrylamide (MBA) in a thermal induced radical process. The cross-linking significantly improved the dielectric properties of PVA thin-films. The relatively low temperature cross-linking process (100℃) could be compatible with flexible substrates. The surface passivation of PVA gate dielectrics with a thin layer of cross-linked PMMA remarkably reduced surface hydrophilicity and improved the morphology of semiconductor layers. The fully solution-processed OFETs devices with the cross-linked PVA/PMMA as bilayer dielectrics, and TIPS-pentacene as semiconductor showed average carrier mobilities of 0.43 cm2V−1s-1 and the ON/OFF ratio of 105. The merits of PVA thin-films are high dielectric constant, biocompatibility and water-soluble. We concluded that PVA with proper structure modification and surface passivation could become useful materials for gate dielectric applications."
