0,Introduction,"Microporous zeolite membranes have been applied on an industrial scale for production of fuel grade ethanol by pervaporation [1]. For modeling permeation of water–alcohol mixtures across microporous membranes in pervaporation and dehydration applications, the fluxes N i are commonly related to the chemical potential gradients ▿μ i by use of the Maxwell–Stefan (M–S) equations [2–21]: (1) − ϕ c i R T ∇ μ i = ∑ j = 1 j ≠ i 2 x j N i − x i N j Ð i j + N i Ð i ; i = 1,2 where ϕ represents the fractional pore volume of the microporous crystalline material, and the concentrations c i are defined in terms of accessible pore volume of the crystalline microporous layer. The fluxes N i are defined in terms of the cross-sectional area of the crystalline framework. The x i in Eq. (1) is the component mole fractions of the adsorbed phase within the microporous structures: (2) x i = c i c t ; i = 1,2 The Ð i characterize species i – wall interactions in the broadest sense. The Ð 12 are exchange coefficients representing interaction between components i with component j. At the molecular level, the Ð ij reflect how the facility for transport of species i correlates with that of species j. Conformity with the Onsager reciprocal relations prescribes (3) Ð 12 = Ð 21 Formally speaking, the M–S equations (1) serve only to define the phenomenological coefficients Ð 1, Ð 2, and Ð 12. In practice, a number of assumptions and simplifications are commonly invoked in the application of Eq. (1) to the modeling of membrane permeation. These assumptions are listed below: (1) The Ð 1 and Ð 2, can be identified with the corresponding M–S diffusivity for unary diffusion, evaluated at the same total loading or occupancy θ t : (4) θ t = ∑ i = 1 2 θ i = ∑ i = 1 2 c i c i , sat where c i,sat is the saturation loading. This has the implication that the Ð i in the mixture should be independent of the partner species. Put another way, for water(1)–methanol(2) diffusion, the value of Ð 1 at any given mixture occupancy θ t should be the same as for water(1)–ethanol(2) diffusion. (2) While the dependence of Ð 1 and Ð 2 on the total loading c t = c 1 + c 2, or occupancy θ t , are commonly accounted for in modeling exercises [7,21], these coefficients are invariably assumed to be independent of the adsorbed phase composition, x i . (3) The exchange coefficient Ð 12 are not easily accessible from experiments. It is most commonly modeled using an interpolation formula that is based on the Vignes [22] model for diffusion in liquid mixtures: (5) Ð 12 = ( Ð 12 x 1 → 1 ) x 1 ( Ð 12 x 2 → 1 ) x 2 = ( Ð 11 ) x 1 ( Ð 22 ) x 2 For diffusion within microporous materials, the Ð ii are the self-exchange coefficients, that are determinable from MD simulations of unary diffusion of both Ð i , and the self-diffusivity, D i,self, by use of the following relationship: (6) 1 D i , self = 1 Ð i + 1 Ð i i The ratio Ð i /Ð ii can be viewed as a measure of the degree of correlations for unary diffusion of species i. As illustration, Fig. 1a presents MD data for CH4, water, methanol, and ethanol diffusion in FAU at 300K. The degree of correlations increases with loading, c i . This is because the number of vacant sites within the structure decreases with increasing loading. Consequently, the number of times a molecule has to return to recently vacated sites increases with c i ; this accounts for increasing correlations. The degree of correlations also depends on the pore size, connectivity and topology. Fig. 1b presents a comparison of Ð i /Ð ii data for CH4 diffusion in FAU, MFI, and LTA. The intersecting channel structures of MFI experience the highest degree of correlations. Since experimental data on the exchange coefficients are rarely available, it is quite common in the literature to invoke the assumption that Ð i /Ð ii ≈1, because of the lack of adequate information on the degree of correlations. (4) In some special cases a further simplification is invoked with respect to the exchange coefficient Ð 12, when modeling permeation across LTA and DDR membranes [5,7]. For such zeolites, correlation effects are commonly assumed to be of negligible importance the windows separating the cages are in the 0.35–0.42nm size range, allowing only one molecule at a time to hop from one cage to the neighboring one. (7) Ð i Ð i i → 0 ; Ð i Ð 12 → 0 ; i = 1,2 ( negligible correlations ) From the data presented in Fig. 1b it can be noted that Eq. (7) is perhaps a reasonable approximation for loadings c i <10kmolm−3. When correlations are of negligible importance the contribution of the first right member of Eq. (1) can be ignored with respect to the second right member, leading to a set of un-coupled equations: (8) N i = − ϕ c i R T Ð i ∇ μ i ; i = 1,2 ( negligible correlations ) Furthermore, the assumption of negligible correlations also implies that (9) D i , s e l f ≈ Ð i ; ( negligible correlations ) for both unary and mixture diffusion. The main objective of this work is to highlight the break-down of all four of the afore-mentioned assumptions when describing permeation of water–alcohol mixtures across microporous membranes. To achieve these objectives Molecular Dynamics (MDs) simulations of diffusion of water–methanol, water–ethanol, and methanol–ethanol, mixtures in FAU, and LTA zeolites were carried out. Diffusion in fluid mixtures, without the restraining influence of pore-walls, was also investigated in order to obtain a clear scientific picture of the underlying physico-chemical principles. The current work is an extension, and amplification, of previous publications [23–25] in which the significant influence of molecular clustering on diffusion characteristics in microporous materials have been underlined. A small portion of earlier MD simulation results [25], have been included in the present work in order to provide a comprehensive palette of data and concepts that will be useful to a practicing membrane technologist for modeling purposes. The simulation methodologies, along with details of the force fields used are exactly as that described in our earlier publication [25]; this information is not repeated here."
1,The Vignes interpolation formula,"Let us begin by examining the validity of the Vignes interpolation formula (5) for water(1)–methanol(2), and water(1)–ethanol(2) mixtures in the liquid phase. MD simulations for the two binary mixtures are shown in Fig. 2a. The Vignes formula is seen to severely overpredict the variation of Ð 12 with x 1 for both liquid mixtures. Available experimental data confirm the trend portrayed in the MD simulations [26–28]. The failure of the Vignes interpolation is traceable to strong hydrogen bonding between water and alcohol molecular pairs. This is evidenced in the data on radial distribution functions (RDFs) presented in Fig. 2b for O–H bond distances for water–water, water–methanol, and methanol–methanol pairs in water–methanol mixtures. The first peaks occur at distances smaller than 2Å, that is characteristic of hydrogen bonding [29]. Collecting information on the first-peak heights for water–methanol mixtures for a variety of compositions, Fig. 2c can be constructed. The first-peak heights for water–methanol pairs are significantly higher than for water–water and methanol–methanol, indicating the much stronger bonding between water and methanol. A similar situation manifests for water–ethanol mixtures; see Fig. 2d. The significantly stronger hydrogen bonding between water–alcohol molecular pairs causes the significant deviation from Vignes estimations. Fig. 3a presents a plot of the first-peak heights of the RDFs for methanol(1)–ethanol(2) liquid mixtures at 300K. It is observed that the first-peak heights for each of the molecule-pairs are nearly the same and there are no significant differences in the degrees of hydrogen bonding. As a logical consequence, the Vignes interpolation formula should be expected to hold for methanol–ethanol mixtures. This is indeed found to be the case, as evidenced by the MD simulation results for Ð 12 presented in Fig. 2b. The data of Figs. 2 and 3 imply that it is not hydrogen bonding, per se, that contributes to deviation from the Vignes formula; rather, it is the difference in the degrees of hydrogen bonding between constituent molecular pairs. The failure of the Vignes interpolation formula for water–alcohol liquid mixtures bodes a corresponding failure for diffusion within microporous structures. This is confirmed by MD simulations of Ð 12 for water–methanol and water–ethanol mixtures in FAU zeolite; see Fig. 4a. The reasons for this failure are also to be attributable to stronger hydrogen bonding between water–alcohol pairs than water–water and alcohol–alcohol pairs in the adsorbed phase within the pores of FAU. By the same token, we should expect the Ð 12 for methanol–ethanol diffusion in FAU to obey the Vignes prescription and this is indeed found to be the case; see Fig. 4b. The success of the Vignes formula for methanol–ethanol diffusion is symptomatic for mixtures of non-polar molecules in microporous materials. To confirm this we present data for diffusion on C3H8–nC4H10 in FAU in Fig. 4c. Put another way, the Vignes interpolation has good estimation capabilities for mixtures of non-polar, and for mixture in which the differences in the hydrogen bonding between molecular pairs are small."
2,Is Ð i in the mixture same as for pure component?,"Fig. 5 presents data on MD simulated values of M–S diffusivities, Ð i , of (a) water, (b) methanol, and (c) ethanol in equimolar (c 1 = c 2) water–methanol, water–ethanol and methanol–ethanol mixtures in FAU at 300K. Also shown are the pure component Ð i determined at the same total mixture occupancy θ t in water–methanol and water–ethanol mixtures. From Fig. 5a it can be observed that the Ð i of water in mixtures with alcohols are significantly lower than that for pure water. The reason for this is that due to hydrogen bonding, water tends to cluster around alcohol molecules. The mobility of water molecules in the mixtures is significantly lowered due to cluster formation. Interestingly, the Ð i of methanol in mixtures with water is also significantly lower than the value for pure methanol; see Fig. 5b. In sharp contrast, the Ð i of methanol in mixtures with ethanol is practically the same as for pure methanol. This result is consonant with the exchange coefficient data presented in Fig. 4b. The hydrogen bonding between methanol–ethanol and methanol–methanol is significantly weaker than for water–methanol pairs. The results for the M–S diffusivity of ethanol are analogous to those for methanol; see Fig. 5c. Compared with pure ethanol, the Ð i is significantly lowered in mixtures with water, but in remains practically the same in mixtures with methanol. The influence of mixture composition on the Ð i in mixtures will now be examined. Fig. 6a presents data for Ð 1 of water in binary mixtures with methanol and ethanol. For both mixtures, we note a reduction in the Ð 1 of water with increasing alcohols concentration within the pores. Furthermore, the mobility of water in mixtures with ethanol is slightly lower than for water–methanol mixtures. The data in Fig. 6a provide a fundamental rationale for experimental observations that the water permeance is significantly reduced by the presence of alcohol in a variety of microporous membranes [6,30,31]. Fig. 6b presents data for the M–S diffusivity Ð i of methanol in water–methanol and methanol–ethanol mixtures. For methanol–ethanol mixtures the M–S diffusivity Ð i is practically independent of composition, whereas in mixtures with water, the Ð i decreases significantly below the pure component value with increasing water concentrations. Water–methanol clustering is much more significant than methanol–ethanol clustering. The results presented in Figs. 5 and 6 indicate that for a certain range of compositions of water–alcohol mixtures there is mutual hindering of both components in the mixture. For water–alcohols diffusion we need to take account not only of the dependence of Ð i with total pore concentration, c t , but also, additionally the influence of the composition of the mixture. There is some experimental evidence of such mutual hindering for permeation of acetone–methanol mixtures across an MFI membrane [32]. Yu et al. [32] found that their experimental data on permeation of methanol–acetone mixtures across an MFI membrane can only be rationalized if both the component Ð i , are lowered in the mixture, when compared with the pure component values. The underlying cause of their findings is most likely to be due to the clustering caused by hydrogen bonding of acetone and methanol molecules, and evidence of such clustering is provided by molecular simulations [33]."
3,Can we assume un-coupled diffusion for LTA and DDR?,"For zeolites such as LTA and DDR the commonly made assumption in practice is that the correlation effects are of negligible importance [5,7], and for modeling purposes it is common to invoke Eq. (8). In order to test this assumption we carried out MD simulations to determine Ð 1, Ð 2, and Ð 12 for equimolar water(1)–methanol(2) mixtures in LTA for a variety of loadings at temperatures of 300K and 350K; see Fig. 7 . The simulations show that Ð 12 is intermediate in value between Ð 1 and Ð 2 and the assumptions required for negligible correlations, Eq. (7), do not hold over the entire range of occupancies θ t . In the study by Kuhn et al. [7] for water–alcohols pervaporation across a DDR membrane, it was found that the use of un-coupled Eq. (8), with the Ð 1 and Ð 2 determined from unary permeation data, lead to a severe overestimation of the permeation fluxes. On the basis of the results presented here, we can trace this poor agreement to a combination of two factors: (1) the Ð i in the mixture is lower than that of the pure components, and (2) correlation effects cannot be considered to be negligible."
4,Conclusions,"For water–alcohol mixtures, the hydrogen bonding between water and alcohol molecules is much stronger than for water–water, and alcohol–alcohol pairs. This leads to a break-down of some commonly made assumptions in the Maxwell–Stefan modeling of membrane permeation. (1) The Maxwell–Stefan diffusivity, Ð i , of either component in water–alcohol mixtures are lower than the corresponding values of the pure components. In practice we need to take account of the influence of mixture composition on the Ð i and on the partner species. (2) The Vignes interpolation formula (5) fails to account for the variation of Ð 12 with composition. Correlation effects are significantly stronger in water–alcohol mixtures than for the constituent species. (3) For zeolites such as LTA and DDR the assumption of un-coupled equations (8) is not justified for water–alcohols permeation."
