0,Introduction,"OMW is one of the main pollutant products in the Mediterranean area. Since the annual production of OMW worldwide has been estimated at more than 30 million m3/year [1], a biodegradation process for OMW is extremely necessary. At first, microalgae using OMW as the nutrient medium were employed for biomass production [2–4]. Subsequently, several aerobic and/or anaerobic processes were reported [5–9]. A different approach has been proposed, one which uses a photo-fermentative process that involves PNSB [10,11]. Alternatively, two continuous reactors can be operated sequentially where the first one ferments sugars under dark conditions, while the second one ferments the acid-containing effluent of the first one under photosynthetic conditions [12]. A two-step process of combining dark fermentation and photo-fermentation may increase the capacity to produce H2 and prevent the environmental problems associated with untreated fermentation effluents [13–16]. Previously, we used the aquatic fern Azolla as an adsorbent vegetable matrix for the removal of both polyphenols (Pp) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) [17]. Subsequently, we investigated a second adsorbing matrix namely granular active carbon (GAC) and we patented a complete process for the depuration of OMW (Patent No. FI2006A000155). During last decade we used pre-treated OMW as feedstock to grow Rhodopseudomonas palustris 6A for the production of biogas rich in H2 [18], and the Eroğlu group developed different strategies based on OMW feedstock for the production of H2 [10,11,14,19]. The OMW includes compounds such as sugars, tannins, polyphenols, poly-alcohols, pectins and lipids [1]. OMW is rich of Pp, which range from 0.2 to 8.0 g/L [20]. Olives contain Pp, such as oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, and tyrosol, rutin, quercetin, caffeic acid, vanillic and coumaric acids, all of which have excellent antioxidant properties and some of the above Pp can be found in OMW [21]. Polyphenols have an inhibitory effect on many bacteria, thus making the direct biological treatment of OMW rather difficult. We removed 99% of the Pp from OMW using two packed vegetable matrices (dry-Azolla and GAC) [18]. Thanks to this pre-treatment process, the black-brownish colour of the OMW faded and the colour intensity decreased from 24.4 to 1.4. Recently, we also investigated the recovery of Pp from OMW, and obtained two powder products characterised by great antiradical activities [21]. The main goal of this investigation was the production of H2 by means of R. palustris using OMW as feedstock. R. palustris is a rod-shaped phototrophic bacterium, which reproduces by budding. It grows in a culture broth (CB) that contains organic compounds such as acids, alcohols and aromatic substances or waste rich in volatile acids. In the present study, R. palustris 42OL was chosen because its performances have been found to be more satisfactory than those of R. palustris 6A [22]. The better capacity of R. palustris 42OL to produce H2 than R. palustris 6A was due to the high specific growth rate of the strain 42OL [23]. The production of H2 and the environmental cleanup were evaluated, together with reactor performances. Tests were carried out at three different irradiances under batch growth operational conditions. Several aspects that concern energy conversion efficiency were investigated as well."
1,Material and methods,
2,Olive mill waste,"2.1 Olive mill waste The OMWF came from an olive-processing plant located in S. Polo in Chianti (FI) – Italy. In order to avoid any sort of dark fermentative process, samples of the OMWF were rapidly centrifuged so as to remove solid suspensions. The liquid fraction was then stored in a dark room at −18 °C."
3,Description of the pre-treatment process,2.2 Description of the pre-treatment process Dry-Azolla and GAC were the two matrices used for the OMWF pre-treatment process. Table 1 shows the main characteristics of the OMW before and after the pre-treatment process. A diagram of this process is provided in Fig. 1 .
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The bacteriochlorophyll (Bchl) was evaluated according to Carlozzi et al. [24], while the biomass dry-weight was determined according to Carlozzi and Sacchi [25]. The COD was determined according to Ena et al. [17]. An elemental analysis of the biomass (C, H, N, O) was performed according to Carlozzi et al. [24]. Analyses for sugars contained in OMWF were conducted according to Giovannelli et al. [26]. The identification and quantification of soluble carbohydrates were performed according to Romani et al. [27]. The acetic acid concentration, in the CB, was evaluated according to Carlozzi and Lambardi [28]. The biogas composition was determined according to Ena et al. [18]; the column temperature was initially 35 °C, and it was subsequently increased to 225 °C (32 °C/min ramp-cycle). The temperature at the injector was 150 °C. The irradiance (I) was measured using a Quantum/Radiometer/Photometer (model LI-185B, LI-COR, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA)."
5,Microorganism and growth conditions,"2.4 Microorganism and growth conditions A dilution (30%, v:v) of pre-treated OMWF using water was made before growing R. palustris 42OL for the production of H2. The initial pH of the CB was 6.8, and was then maintained within the range of 6.8–7.2. All experiments were carried out under continuous light, at three different I values (18.5, 37 and 74 W/m2). At the I of 74 W/m2, we also investigated the CB containing pre-treated OMWF added with 0.5 g/L of NH4Cl, in order to inhibit nitrogenase. Further investigations about this topic were carried out, when the hydrogen evolution had stopped, and we added NH4Cl (0.5 g/L) to the not totally exhausted CB and subsequently we examined the growth."
6,Photobioreactor,"2.5 Photobioreactor We used a flat glass photobioreactor (FGPBR) 1.1 L (Fig. 2 ). The FGPBR had 5.0 cm culture thickness, a 1.0 L of working volume, and an irradiated area of 0.02235 m2. The FGPBR was placed in a heat exchanger-Plexiglas water bath (30 ± 0.2 °C), and a magnetic stir bar mixed the culture. The FGPBR was irradiated on the large side using a 150 W OSRAM power-star HQI-TS lamp. The general view of the cultural system used in the present study was the same reported by Carlozzi [23], but the cylindrical photobioreactor was changed with the FGPBR (Fig. 2). The three different I values, at which we operated the investigations, were measured on the wall of the FGPBR."
7,Theory,"The specific growth rate (μ e ) was determined using the following equation: (1) μ e = ( ln BC 2 − ln BC 1 ) / ( t 2 − t 1 ) where BC2 and BC1 are, respectively, the biomass concentrations at times t 2 and t 1 [23]. The COD removal efficiency (CODRE) was determined using the following equation: (2) COD RE ( % ) = ( COD 0 − COD F ) / COD 0 × 100 where the COD0 and the COD F indicate, respectively, the COD values at t 0 and t F . The light conversion efficiency (η) was determined by using the following equation: (3) η ( % ) = 33.61 · ρ H 2 · V H 2 I · A · t H 2 × 100 In order to calculate η, we considered that the theoretical photo-conversion of the organic load (of the pre-treated OMWF that we used to create the CB) was all used for the production of H2 and CO2, in accordance with Gest et al. [29], who proposed the following equation: (4) C x H y O z + ( 2 x − z ) H 2 O Irradiance → ( 1 2 y + 2 x − z ) H 2 + x CO 2 The above Eq. (4) was also reported by Vincenzini et al. [30] and more recently by Eroğlu et al. [11]."
8,Results,"Before the OMW F was used as feedstock for the H2 production, it was pre-treated with dry-Azolla and GAC in order to remove all possible Pp content. Cumulative hydrogen achieved by growing R. palustris 42OL at the three irradiances is shown in Fig. 3 . The highest accumulation of H2 achieved in this study, over a period of 215 h, and at an I of 74 W/m2, was 1030 ml-H2/L-broth. Changes in Bchl concentration versus the culture age were checked and the results are shown in Fig. 4 : at the I of 18.5 W/m2, the Bchl concentration reached its lowest value of 5.0 mg/L; at the I of 37 W/m2 the Bchl concentration grew to 9.6 mg/L, and at the I of 74 W/m2, the Bchl concentration increased further (11.7 mg/L). We calculated the μ e of R. palustris 42OL achieved at the three irradiances: the results, which indicate that the higher the I, the higher μ e are shown in Table 2 . The table also shows the COD0 and the COD F verified at the end of every experimental set. During the H2 evolution, the lowest COD F (2247 mg/L) was attained at the I of 74 W/m2 and the productivity of biomass dry-weight increased in accordance with the I reaching the maximal value of 760 mg(dw)/L. At the I of 37 and 74 W/m2, we added NH4Cl (0.5 g/L) to the not totally exhausted CB when the H2 evolution stopped, and then examined the growth. Under this new growth condition (without H2 evolution) the COD F decreased further to 1460 mg/L, at the I of 74 W/m2. When we investigated about the CB containing pre-treated OMW, which had been added (at the beginning) to 0.5 g/L of NH4Cl so as to inhibit nitrogenase, the COD F reached 1540 mg/L and the maximal productivity of biomass dry-weight was thus attained (865 mg(dw)/L), at the I of 74 W/m2. The HPRavg increased in accordance with the I up to a maximum of 5.28 ml-H2/L-broth/h (Table 2). Fig. 5 shows the CODRE attained under the three I values and using pre-treated OMW F , for the production of H2. The CODRE increased depending on the I and reached the highest value (47.1%) at the I of 74 W/m2. The absolute maximum CODRE (63.8%) was achieved when NH4Cl was added to the CB in order to prevent the production of H2 from inhibiting the nitrogenase. At the end of all our experiments, the composition of the not totally exhausted CB, which contained pre-treated OMWF (30%, v:v), was checked. The results have been reported in Table 3 . From a careful analysis of the results we can see that mannitol and acetic acid did not always completely disappear at the end of T H . On the contrary, at T S , which was the longest culture age, all carbon sources (sugar, mannitol, acetic acid) disappeared after NH4Cl (0.5 g/L) was added. All trends of the HPRavg and the η are shown in Fig. 6 . The HPRavg grew depending on the I, and reached its maximum (5.28 ml-H2/L-broth/h) at the I of 74 W/m2. The η was maximal (1.07%) at 37 W/m2, and decreased (<1.0%) at both lower and higher I. When R. palustris 42OL was grown at the I of 37 W/m2, a different reduction grade (R) was observed in the dry-biomasses produced (Table 4 ). Moreover, the −ΔP B was 6.234 kcal/g in the biomass harvested at the end of the hydrogen photo-evolution and 6.754 kcal/g in the biomass harvested after adding NH4Cl. The H2 evolution then ceased."
9,Discussion,"Using the pre-treated OMW F as feedstock to produce H2, we demonstrated that the higher the I, the higher the cumulative hydrogen. This behaviour was fully in accordance with another study of ours [23], in which R. palustris 42OL was investigated at low to high I (36–803 W/m2) using a synthetic CB containing malic acid. In the present study, we did not investigate the production of H2 at I greater than 74 W/m2, to avoid reducing further η, because its highest value (1.07%) was achieved at the I of 37 W/m2 and decreased at both lower and higher I values. Recently Eroğlu et al. [11], using 2% OMW diluted in water, reported a CODRE of 33% under conditions of continuous illumination. At the highest I investigated (74 W/m2), we obtained a CODRE that was about 14 percentage points higher than the Eroğlu results. This difference increased further when NH4Cl was added to the CB at the beginning of the growth. When Vincenzini et al. [30] used sugar-refinery waste for the purposes of H2 production, they reported a CODRE of 43%, which was similar to the results obtained in the present study. When the same group used an effluent as straw paper-mill, the CODRE decreased greatly (by 28%). As far as η is concerned, we have already demonstrated the gap in Eq. (3) (of this study) as compared to the more complete Eq. (6) reported in 2009 [23], which took into account both the amount of organic substances consumed and the energy stored as dry-biomass that was produced together with H2. The equation proposed in 2009 [23] has not been used in the present study, because all the carbon sources contained in OMW F were not identified. The η of 1.07%, which we obtained at the I of 37 W/m2 by means of OMW F as feedstock, was near the value (η = 1.2%) reported by Vincenzini et al. [30] using malic acid as a carbon source. In 2010, Eroğlu and co-authors [11] calculated η according to the Eq. (3). At an I of 200 W/m2, they obtained values of 0.12% and 0.35% respectively, under a continuous and a light–dark cycle (12L/12D). Eroğlu's η values were lower than the ones obtained in the current study. We believe that this is due to the higher I which they used (200 W/m2), compared to the one we used (37 W/m2) in order to obtain η = 1.07%. The capacity of PNSB to utilize several carbon sources, such as glucose, fructose, mannitol and organic acids is well-known, as indicated in the literature [19,31,32]; likewise well-known is the conversion of volatile fatty acids VFA into H2 by means of PNSB [33]. OMW contains considerable amounts of organic constituents such as sugars, volatile acids, poly-alcohols, and fats [10]. At the I values of 18.5 and 37 W/m2, we found a substantial quantity of mannitol and acetic acid in the CB (not totally exhausted) after H2 evolution by means of R. palustris 42OL. The residual quantity of mannitol and acetic acid decreased at 37 W/m2, and disappeared at 74 W/m2. It is believed that R. palustris 42OL should have used totally acetic acid for H2 production and/or biomass synthesis. Why this did not happen at low intensities is still unclear. In the above case, it was probably due to the experimental culture operation that stopped the investigation when the H2 evolution was finished. In order to understand the phenomena, in the culture grown at the irradiances of 37 and 74 W/m2, NH4Cl (0.5 g/L) was added when the H2 evolution stopped; the bacterial growth was checked over the following days. It was found that the culture grew further reaching Bchl concentrations of 19.3 mg/L and 23.3 mg/L (data not shown) at the culture ages of 429 and 361 h, respectively. The CODF then decreased further to 1500 mg/L and 1460 mg/L respectively (Table 2). We attributed this behaviour to a case of extended nitrogen starvation, which caused the arrest in growth of the PNSB. Moreover, by using the not totally exhausted CB harvested at the end of the H2 evolution (at the I of 37 W/m2) to which NH4Cl was added, in order to re-inoculate a fresh culture, it was also found that the not totally exhausted CB was able to sustain the growth of this new culture (data not shown). The COD F of not totally exhausted CB had an inverse relationship with the I: “The higher the I, the lower the COD F ”. This behaviour was fully in agreement with our previous investigation [23]; in it, R. palustris 42OL grown in a synthetic CB achieved the highest hydrogen evolution rate of 17.217 ml-H2/L-broth/h, at the I of 500 W/m2. In the current study, cumulative hydrogen increased in accordance with the I: at the I of 74 W/m2, the highest cumulative hydrogen was reached, and the HPRavg was 5.87 ml-H2/L-broth/h. When R. palustris 42OL was grown in a synthetic medium containing acetic acid [28], the HPRavg was 23.7% higher than the results reported in the present exploration using pre-treated OMW F . This fact could have been due to the growth conditions used in the previous study (fed-batch growth) [28], which were better than those of this study (batch growth). Moreover, we used pre-treated OMW F as feedstock, and several different carbon sources were contained in the CB. In agreement with our previous results [28] achieved under a fed-batch operation, Li et al. [34] obtained an enhancement in the phototrophic H2 production by means of R. sphaeroides ZX-5 using the same growth strategy."
10,Conclusions,"Pre-treated OMW was found to be a good feedstock for R. palustris 42OL in order to produce H2. By increasing the I, two benefits were attained: (i) the cumulative hydrogen grew significantly, and (ii) a shorter culture age was required. The addition of NH4Cl after the production of H2 made it possible to increase the CODRE further, thus providing several advantages as regards environmental cleanup. Even if a part of the initial organic load of OMW F was lost during the pre-treatment process, this last pre-treatment enabled the use of OMW F (30%, v:v) as feedstock for PNSB."
