0,Introduction,"The exhaustion of fossil fuels and environmental pollution have become increasingly serious problems, and it is urgent to develop new energy [1,2]. Hydrogen is considered to be a candidate for future energy strategy due to its environmental friendliness and renewability. Electrochemical water splitting is one of the most effective methods for producing high-purity hydrogen [3,4]. At present, Pt and Ru/Ir-based precious metal materials are considered as the most effective catalysts to reduce the overvoltage of the two half reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [5,6]. However, their scarcity and high cost hinder their large-scale application. It is desirable to develop low-cost, high efficiency and high stability alternatives for HER [7]. In recent years, people have been committed to the development of non-precious metal HER catalysts, and are exploring transition metal-based materials, such as sulfides [8], phosphides [9], nitrides [10], and oxides [11], have emerged as attractive HER electrocatalysts, due to their low cost, earth abundance and environmental friendliness. Among them, transition metal phosphides (TMPs), such as MoP [12], CoP [13], NiP [14], FeP [15], CuP [16], and others, have received great attentions as a promising candidate owing to their inherent high HER activity, good electrical conductivity, excellent stability and earth abundance [17]. Co-based monometallic phosphides (such as CoP, Co2P and CoP3) and bimetallic phosphides (such as NiCoP, FeCoP, Mn-Co-P and CoMoP) show promising HER activities due to their good electrical conductivity and high redox characteristics of Co [18,19]. However, most of HER active materials still suffer from relatively large overpotential because of the alkaline HER process involving multiple reactions and slow kinetics of water dissociation [20,21]. The strategy to solve this problem is to combine different TMPs active materials to improve electron transfer efficiency to enhance the HER activity of Co-based TMPs electrocatalysts. In addition, the properties of the materials depend largely on their morphology [22,23]. The core-shell structure has become a feasible way to design electrocatalysts due to its strong interaction, more exposed active sites and larger active area [24]. The core-shell structure with high specific surface area, as a promising morphology, can expose abundant active sites in multiple dimensions and promote charge transfer in interconnected structures. At the same time, the interface of the composite catalyst also plays a role in improving the activity of the catalyst [25]. These results indicate that the interface formed between different active materials, such as interfacial interaction, synergistic effect and strength, is conducive to the formation of more active sites, which has a high prospect in the application of HER [26,27]. Therefore, the integration of different active materials into a multi-component core-shell structure is very attractive in the development of high-performance HER catalysts. Herein, we report a new type of core-shell Ni2P@CoP nanoarrays supported on nickel foam (NF) (Ni2P@CoP/NF) with large surface area, serving as an efficient cathode for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this core-shell structure, a large number of tiny Ni2P nanosheets are tightly wrapped in the CoP nanowires, forming a rich heterostructure interface, which can provide more active centers, improve the conductivity and enhance the catalytic efficiency. Moreover, the adjacency of Ni and Co in the periodic table ensures a sufficiently low lattice mismatch between Ni2P and CoP, thus having good stability. As a result, Ni2P@CoP/NF NAs exhibited excellent HER activity with a low overpotential of 61 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and good durability in the alkaline media. Our work provides new light on the synthesis of core-shell structure TMPs for hydrogen production through water splitting."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Cobalt sulfate heptahydrate (CoSO4·7H2O), ammonium fluoride (NH4F), urea (CH4N2O), nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2), ethanol and Ni foam were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Pt/C (20 wt%) was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Deionized(DI) water is purified by Millipore system. All chemical reagents were used without any further purification."
3,Synthesis,"2.2 Synthesis Synthesis of Co3O4 NWs/NF: In a typical synthesis, Co3O4 NWs/NF were first synthesized by a hydrothermal method [28,29]. CoSO4·7H2O (10 mmol), NH4F (20 mmol) and CH4N2O (50 mmol) were dissolved in 50 mL deionized (DI) water under vigorously stirring for 2 h. Then the solution and nickel foam were transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50 mL). Afterward, the autoclave was placed at 120 °C for 5 h in an electric oven [29]. After cooling down naturally, the resulting purple products on NF were washed several times alternatively with ethanol and deionized water, and dried overnight in a freeze dryer. Finally, the resulting purple product on NF was calcinated at 250 °C in air for 4 h, and the as-synthesized Co3O4 nanowires array grown on NF(Co3O4 NWs/NF) was obtained. Synthesis of Ni(OH)2@Co3O4/NF: the Co3O4 NWs/NF was immersed into a 0.1 M Ni(NO3)2 aqueous solution and maintained at 85 °C for 5 h. After cooling down naturally, the obtained Ni(OH)2@Co3O4/NF were washed several times alternatively with ethanol and deionized water, and dried overnight in a freeze dryer. Synthesis of core-shell Ni2P@CoP/NF: To get Ni2P@CoP bimetallic phosphide, Ni(OH)2@Co3O4/NF and NaH2PO2 were placed at two separate positions at a quartz tube, and NaH2PO2 was placed at the upstream side of the quartz tube. The mass ratio for Ni(OH)2@Co3O4/NF to NaH2PO2 is 1:10. Then the quartz tube was heated to 300 °C with a ramp rate of 2 °C/min under the atmosphere of N2, and then maintained for 2 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the Ni2P@CoP/NF was obtained. Synthesis of CoP/NF and Ni2P/NF: For comparison, CoP/NF and Ni2P/NF were obtained by direct phosphating of the above Co3O4 NWs/NF and Ni(OH)2/NF, respectively. Preparation of Pt/C electrode: 3.5 mg Pt/C (20 wt%) was added into the solution consist of 0.75 mL ethyl alcohol and 0.25 mL 5 wt% Nafion solution, and then the solution was sonicated for 1 h. Finally, the ink was dropped into a pretreated NF to maintain the Pt/C mass loading of 3.5 mg cm−2, and dried at room temperature."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Carl Zeiss, Auriga-4525) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20) were used to characterized the morphology and structure of the synthesized materials. FESEM was also used to obtain energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of materials. The lattice fringe was investigated by High-resolution TEM (HRTEM, JEOL JEM 2100). X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, MiniFlex 300/600) characterizations were performed by Cu Kα radiation at a scanning rate of 5º/min. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were recorded on a Thermo Fischer ESCALAB 250Xi spectrophotometer."
5,Electrochemical measurements,"2.4 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical measurements were achieved at an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E) in 1 M KOH aqueous solution at room temperature (25 °C). The three-electrode system consists of a graphite rod as the counter electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) electrode as reference electrode, and the prepared catalyst as working electrode. In the test, the potentials used had been carefully calibrated to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte solution. In all measurements, the potential was converted to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is based on the Nernst equation: E (RHE)= E (SCE)+ 0.242 + 0.059 × pH. The polarization curve measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a sweep rate of 2 mVs−1, and the iR compensation was 85%. Tafel slope diagram was obtained by fitting LSV curve according to the Tafel equation: η = a+ blog | j |, where j is the current density and b is the Tafel slope. Electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl) of each synthesized sample were measured between 0.1 and 0.2 V versus RHE at different scan rates (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 mVs−1) to evaluate the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). The Cdl value is half of the linear slope. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured at an amplitude of 5 mV in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz under open circuit potential. The long-term durability test was realized by the constant current method, and the polarization current density was − 10 mA cm−2."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Material synthesis and characterization,"3.1 Material synthesis and characterization As illustrated in Scheme 1, Co3O4 nanowires were first synthesized on the surface of the three-dimensional NF by hydrothermal method and annealing method. Then, Ni(OH)2 nanosheets were synthesized on the surface of Co3O4 nanowire arrays by hydrothermal method at 85 °C for 5 h. Finally, the obtained Ni(OH)2@Co3O4/NF precursors were further phosphating under nitrogen atmosphere to obtain Ni2P@CoP/NF. Noticeably, the core-shell structure of Ni2P@CoP/NF provides a high specific surface area and exposes more active sites, thereby enhancing electron transport and promoting the release of hydrogen from the surface. The unique surface effect and the synergistic effect between CoP and Ni2P make the electrocatalytic performance of Ni2P@CoP/NF significantly improved [30,31]. Such core-shell-structured bimetallic phosphide nano-catalyst is expected to enhance the electrochemistry ability toward HER. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to analyze the composition and crystal-phase of as-synthesized samples. The XRD pattern of the Ni(OH)2@Co3O4/NF is shown in Fig. S1. The three strong signals of Ni(OH)2@Co3O4/NF at 44.2°, 51.9° and 76.2° are ascribed to the NF substrate (JCPDS NO.65-2865) [32], and other peaks are well ascribed to Co3O4 (JCPDS No. 42-1467) and Ni(OH)2 (JCPDS No. 14-0117) [29]. The XRD patterns indicate that the Ni(OH)2@Co3O4/NF was successfully synthesized. Fig. 1a shows the XRD pattern of the Ni2P@CoP/NF. After phosphating, the diffraction peaks at 40.7°, 44.6°, 47.3° and 55.0° are well ascribed to the (111), (021), (210) and (211) planes of Ni2P (JCPDS No. 65-3544), respectively [5,33]. The diffraction peaks at 31.6°, 35.3°, 36.3°, 36.7°, 38.9°, 46.2°, 48.1° and 52.3° are well ascribed to the (011), (200), (111), (102), (201), (112), (211) and (103) planes of CoP (JCPDS No. 65-1474), respectively [19,34]. The XRD patterns analysis revealed the successful synthesis of the Ni2P@CoP/NF catalyst. As a comparison, the XRD patterns of CoP/NF (Fig. S2) and Ni2P/NF (Fig. S3) were performed. It can be seen from the XRD patterns that the Ni2P and CoP were successfully synthesized. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the chemical composition and electronic interaction of Ni2P@CoP/NF. The XPS summary spectrum in Fig. 1b shows that Ni2P@CoP/NF is composed of nickel, cobalt, and phosphorus, respectively. In Fig. 1c, the binding energy of Ni 2p at 852.6 eV and 869.8 eV for Ni2P@CoP/NF can be identified as Ni2+, and the fitting peaks at 874.6 eV and 856.8 eV correspond to Ni3+ [35]. In addition, two shaking satellites were observed at 861.6 eV and 880.2 eV, further confirming the existence of Ni2+ and Ni3+ ions [36,37]. In the Co 2p spectrum (Fig. 1d), the binding energies for the Co 2p3/2 at 778.3, 782.2 and 785.5 eV are attributed to Co-P, oxidized Co species, and satellite peaks, respectively. Similarly, the binding energies for the Co 2p1/2 at 793.3, 798.2 and 802.9 eV can be attributed to Co-P, oxidized Co species, and satellite peaks, respectively [38]. For the P 2p spectrum (Fig. 1e), the double peaks at 129.2 and 130.1 eV can be attributed to Ni-P or Co-P in metal phosphide [18,39]. These results indicate that Co and Ni have a positive charge (δ+), while P has a negative charge (δ-), indicating that there is an electron density transfer from Co and Ni to P. The peak at 134.6 eV can be attributed to the oxidized phosphorous substance PO4 3-, possibly due to the oxidation of samples exposed to air, which is a common phenomenon observed in metal phosphides [40]. Therefore, the above XPS data shows that Ni(OH)2@Co3O4/NF has been successfully converted to Ni2P@CoP/NF. After phosphating, Ni-P and Co-P were formed, and there is an electronic interaction between Ni2P and CoP, which will contribute to the improvement of HER performance [41–43]. The structure and microscopic morphology of the prepared samples are characterized by SEM and TEM. The SEM images of Ni(OH)2@Co3O4/NF are shown in Fig. 2a,b. A large number of tiny Ni(OH)2 nanosheets are closely grown on the Co3O4 nanowires, which can increase the specific surface area and expose more active sites. The porous network has a large amount of void spaces, which is favorable for the mass transport and electrolyte penetration. The SEM images in a higher magnification (Fig. 2b) reveals thin Ni(OH)2 nanosheets with smooth surface [44]. After phosphating, the surface of the nanosheets becomes rough, and many small particles appear, forming a rich heterostructure interface (Fig. 2c,d). The rough nanowire heterostructure with rich interfaces is expected to provide more electrochemically accessible locations and achieve rapid charge transfer, thereby helping to improve HER efficiency [45,46]. The SEM image of Ni2P/NF (Fig. S5, Supporting Information) shows that the sample is composed of a large number of nanosheets, and the nanosheets are disordered. The CoP/NF (Fig. S6, supporting information) shows a nanowire morphology, and the size of the nanowire is much smaller than the size of Ni2P@CoP/NF. The corresponding X-ray element mapping images further verify that P, Co and Ni are uniformly distributed throughout the structure (Fig. 2e). This uniform element distribution reveals that the rough nanowire structure is composed of Ni2P and CoP. The atomic content of the corresponding elements on the catalyst surface is shown in Fig. S7 (Supporting Information), and the result shows that the atomic content of Co:Ni:P is 4.53:1.00:2.95. As shown in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Fig. 2f), it can be seen that the Ni2P nanosheets were tightly wrapped on the CoP nanowires, to which visible particles attached. These particles may be Ni2P and CoP. These nanowires are composed of nanoparticles with a size of around 20 nm. Mesoporous structure is observed between the tiny particles. These structures facilitate the diffusion or immersion of electrolyte ions during the reaction, providing channels for the release of H2, and even offering more active sites to promote HER activity [41]. The HRTEM image (Fig. 2g) shows that the nanosheets with a thickness of approximately 8.25 nm. And the lattice fringes with interplanar spacings of 0.283 and 0.249 nm, corresponding to (011) and (111) planes of CoP, respectively [47]. The lattice fringe with interplanar spacing of 0.228 nm correspond to the (111) planes of Ni2P [5,48]. The uniform distribution of Ni2P and CoP will have a great positive effect on the synergistic effect of Ni2P and CoP, which may be beneficial to improve the catalytic performance of Ni2P@CoP/NF [49]. All the above observations indicate that the core-shell nanowire structure composed of CoP and Ni2P was fabricated."
8,Hydrogen evolution activity,"3.2 Hydrogen evolution activity The electrocatalytic activity of the Ni2P@CoP/NF for HER was evaluated by linear scan voltammetry (LSV) in the alkaline electrolyte (1.0 M KOH). Fig. 3a shows the polarization curve of Ni2P@CoP/NF in 1.0 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1. The Ni2P/NF, CoP/NF and commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) were also examined for comparison. The overpotential of Ni2P@CoP/NF is only 61 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is much lower than those of Ni2P/NF (202 mV) and CoP/NF (146 mV), and is close to that of commercial Pt/C (28 mV). In addition, the Ni2P@CoP/NF exhibits a much larger current density than Ni2P/NF and CoP/NF at all potentials, indicating the high electrocatalytic activity for HER in basic solution. These results indicate that this unique core-shell Ni2P@CoP nanoarray structure and the synergistic effect of Ni2P and CoP greatly improve the performance of HER [50]. The Ni2P@CoP/NF only needs the overpotential of 94 and 167 mV to achieve the current density of 30 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively. The synergistic effect between Ni2P and CoP can promote the rapid transfer of electrons, which greatly improves the catalytic efficiency. It is worthwhile to mention that the Ni2P@CoP/NF exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance and the corresponding overpotentials are much smaller than those of most reported non-Pt HER catalysts in basic media (Table S1, Supporting Information), such as Cu3P NS/NF (η10 =105 mV) [17], NiCoP-NWAs/NF (η10 =104 mV) [18], Ni2P@NiFe hydroxide (η10 =75 mV) [40], CoP/rGO (η10 =150 mV) [51], and so on. The HER kinetics in the above various electrodes were investigated by the corresponding Tafel plots [52]. As shown in Fig. 3b, the Ni2P@CoP/NF only shows Tafel slope of 55 mVdec−1, which is close to that of the Pt/C electrocatalysts loaded on NF, and is much lower than 79 mVdec−1 for CoP/NF and 120 mVdec−1 for Ni2P/NF. It shows that the Ni2P@CoP/NF surface go through a possible Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism, and the hydrogen detachment (Heyrovsky process) will be a rate determining step [53]. In order to clarify the superior activity of Ni2P@CoP/NF, an important electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was obtained by cyclic voltammetry (CV) [54], as shown in Fig. S8. The electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl) is linearly related to the effective ECSA [55]. It can be seen from Fig. 3c that Ni2P@CoP/NF also exhibits a larger electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) (38.26mFcm−2) than Ni2P/NF (10.17mFcm−2) and CoP/NF (12.15mFcm−2), indicating that Ni2P@CoP/NF afford a larger active surface area [56]. The results confirmed that Ni2P@CoP/NF has more active centers, which can buffer barriers to ion migration, promote hydrogen desorption on the catalyst surface, and has excellent HER performance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to characterize HER kinetics, shown in Fig. 3d. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) of Ni2P@CoP/NF at a potential of 200 mV (vs SCE) is estimated to be 2.08 Ω, which is lower than that of CoP/NF (8.74 Ω), Ni2P/NF (16.15 Ω) and Ni(OH)2@Co3O4/NF (34.12 Ω), respectively. The Rct value was closely related to the dynamic characteristics of HER [57]. The smaller semicircle at low frequency region reflects the faster charge transfer process in the electrode, namely the smaller Rct [58]. This result proved that the catalyst has a fast electron transfer rate, which will contribute to the improvement of HER catalytic performance. The Brunner-Emmet-Teller method (BET) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda method (BJH) were also used to test the specific surface area and pore diameter of Ni2P@CoP/NF and Ni(OH)2@Co3O4/NF. As shown in Fig. S9a, the specific surface area of Ni(OH)2@Co3O4/NF is 32.47 m2 g−1, which is slightly smaller than Ni2P@CoP/NF (36.76 m2 g−1). As shown in Fig. S9b, the pore sizes of Ni2P@CoP/NF and Ni(OH)2@Co3O4/NF are mainly distributed at 3 nm ~ 18 nm, indicating that they are mesoporous structures. The average pore diameters of Ni2P@CoP/NF and Ni(OH)2@Co3O4/NF are 13.57 nm and 17.28 nm, respectively. The average pore volume of Ni2P@CoP/NF is 0.19 cm3 g−1, which is slightly smaller than the average pore volume of Ni(OH)2@Co3O4/NF (0.22 cm3 g−1). Since the overall pore volume is almost the same, it can be concluded that Ni2P@CoP/NF has a greater number of mesopores. The larger quantities of mesopores result in more contact area with the electrolyte, thereby promoting adsorption and catalytic reactions [59]. This is consistent with the previous TEM images, indicating that the prepared Ni2P@CoP/NF catalyst has excellent HER performance under alkaline conditions. The durability of electrocatalyst is another key parameter of electrocatalytic activity. The long-term stability was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry in 1.0 M KOH. As shown in Fig. 3e, at a constant current density of − 10 mA cm−2, only about 16 mV of degradation was observed after 50 h of testing. According to previous studies, these fluctuations along the chronoamperometric curve were caused by the alternate process of hydrogen bubble accumulation and release [60]. The XRD image (Fig. S4) shows that Ni2P@CoP/NF still has crystalline CoP and Ni2P phases, indicating that the core-shell structure of Ni2P@CoP has excellent stability after 50 h of the stability test. The SEM image shows that the original structure of Ni2P@CoP/NF was basically retained, whereas some particles were peeled off after 50 h of stability test (Fig. S10). As shown in Fig. 3f, the polarization curves of Ni2P@CoP/NF was similar to the initial one after 5000 cycles, suggesting that the catalyst has good durability in alkaline solution. It can be concluded from the above analysis that Ni2P@CoP/NF exhibits good HER performance and long-time stability in alkaline solution. The high electrocatalytic performance of Ni2P@CoP/NF for HER in alkaline solution can be attributed to the following aspects: (a) the strong electronic interaction and the synergistic effect of Ni2P and CoP improve the electrical activity of HER; (b) the core-shell Ni2P@CoP nanoarrays can provide a large specific surface area and abundant active sites, which is extremely beneficial to improve HER; (c) the chemical and electronic coupling between CoP and NF are beneficial to improve catalysis performance; (d) the NF as a carrier material not only improves the conductivity of the hybrid catalyst, but also enhances the dispersion of the electroactive phase; (e) the Ni2P@CoP/NF will be much less vulnerable to dissolution, which helps improve the stability of the catalyst."
9,Conclusions,"In conclusion, the novel core-shell Ni2P@CoP/NF cathode was designed and fabricated. The Ni2P@CoP/NF shows high electrocatalytic activity with a small overpotential of 61 mV to attain the current densities of 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 55 mVdec−1 for HER in basic solution (1.0 M KOH). The improved electrocatalytic activity and stability result from the unique core-shell structure and heteroatoms-doping, together with the synergistic effect between Ni2P and CoP. The findings will promote the development of low-cost, highly efficient and stable non-noble-metal Ni2P@CoP/NF for future renewable energy conversion and storage systems. Meanwhile, this work offers open new insights into synthesis of other related multifunctional catalysts for electrochemical reactions."
