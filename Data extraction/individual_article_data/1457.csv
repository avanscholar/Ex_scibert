0,Introduction,"In the last years, the increase in fuel costs and the alarming environmental issues made the governing bodies of several countries implement severe regulations to lower pollutant emissions and improve the use of renewable energy sources. Large efforts have been performed by researchers and industries to develop unconventional and more efficient power generation systems, to reduce the dependency on fossil fuels and decrease harmful emissions, especially in urban environment. Great attention is drawn, for instance, by batteries and fuel cells in automotive applications. However, their spread in the worldwide market is still hindered by several problems (if compared to conventional systems): (i) high costs of materials and manufacturing processes, (ii) low range, durability and reliability, (iii) limited availability of dedicated refuelling stations. Therefore, Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs) will be still predominant in private and public transportation at least for the next two decades. The improvement of engine efficiency and the use of alternative fuels are playing a key role in emissions reduction. Indeed, Compressed Natural Gas(CNG), Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), biodiesels, alcohols (e.g., methanol and ethanol) and hydrogen are considered cleaner and more environmental friendly fuels if compared to gasoline and Diesel [1]. Among them, hydrogen has been considered quite attractive for its unique features, especially if used as fuel additive [2]. Hydrogen is fully renewable, recyclable and non-pollutant [3]. It has a wide flammability range (from 4% to 75% volume in air) and low ignition energy (0.02 mJ), which allows running engines at large air/fuel ratios and lean mixtures [4]. Hydrogen shows high flame speed and high diffusivity, which improve mixture uniformity and prompt ignition [5]. Moreover, it has high octane rating, auto ignition temperature (585 °C) and specific energy content (142.18 MJ/kg as Higher Heating Value (HHV) and 120.21 MJ/kg as Lower Heating Value (LHV) [6]). These properties allow achieving various improvements in engines operation. For instance, larger compression ratio can be adopted [5], while lower cylinder peak temperatures and pressures are achieved under extreme lean mixtures [7]. Moreover, the more uniform mixing of air and fuel, combined with the sudden and rapid combustion, enhances, on the one hand, the overall thermal efficiency, and reduces, on the other hand, engine emissions [2]. In the work of de Morais et al. [7], the effects obtained by using pure hydrogen as partial substitute in a Diesel power generator are investigated. The chosen engine presented the following features: four cylinders, direct injection, 3922 cc and 50 kW (@ 2800 rpm) of nominal power. The authors kept the engine unmodified, but equipped the fuel intake with a hydrogen injection system, controlled through a dedicated Electronic Control Unit (ECU). Various hydrogen flow rates (that allowed to replace from 5% to 20% of Diesel fuel on energy basis) were tested at different loads (from 0 kW to 40 kW), achieving a fuel consumption reduction of about 16% at high concentrations and loads, although no significant changes in Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) or air to fuel ratio were noticed over the whole range. Nonetheless, a reduction in CO2 emissions up to 12% was observed. Similarly, Kakoee et al. [8] studied the effects of hydrogen addition into a CNG/Diesel reactivity controlled engine, by means of numerical simulation performed through computational fluid dynamic method coupled with Chemkin solver. Three hydrogen concentrations where analysed (i.e., 10%, 20% and 30%) observing an increase in engine efficiency and mean effective pressure. Moreover, combustion is improved with a reduction in unburned hydrocarbons and CO emissions, but with the rise in NOx ones. Zhang et al. [9] performed an experimental study of the effects related to hydrogen addition to an ethanol fuelled engine, under low loads, lean and unthrottled operating conditions. They observed that the use of hydrogen allows the extension of the lean burning limits, with improvements in the obtained brake thermal efficiency. Moreover, a reduction in HC and CO emissions was also observed, although NOx ones tended to increase. The work of Verma et al. [10] investigated the change in performance of a Diesel engine operating in dual fuel mode, with CNG, biogas and hydrogen as main fuels and diesel as pilot one. The authors performed both an experimental study and an exergy analysis, operating the engine at two loading conditions (i.e., low and full load) and five injection timings. Specifically for the use of hydrogen, they observed that high in-peak cylinder pressures as well as exhaust gas temperatures (especially at low loads) are obtained. Exergy efficiency was found to be the highest with respect to the other fuels, and exergy destruction to be the lowest. High NOx emissions were observed at high loads. Luo and Sun [11] carried out experimental tests on a turbocharged engine fuelled only with hydrogen, to analyse the effects of load, speed, spark timing, equivalence ratio and coolant temperature on engine energy balance. It is worth noting that hydrogen might not be used as sole fuel in Compressed Ignition (CI) engines, since it is difficult to reach auto ignition temperature, thus requiring a spark plug [4]. Knocking and detonation, as well as backfire, flashbacks and pre-ignitions issues, not desirable in Spark Ignition (SI) engines, can also occur [5]. Furthermore, the low density of hydrogen requires on-board storage at high pressures, with related safety issues. To overcome all these problems, a solution can be found in the direct on-board production of hydrogen, through, e.g., electrolyser units, thus reducing storage. Electrolysis is a widely renown methodology through which hydrogen and oxygen gases are produced from water by providing voltage or current to the electrolyser unit [12]. A direct mixture of hydrogen and oxygen is known in the literature as Oxy-Hydrogen (HHO) or Brown’s Gas [6]. Such mixture has been widely analysed by several researchers to investigate efficiency improvements and emissions reduction in both CI [3,13–16] and SI [17–20] engines. Noteworthy is the work of Yilmaz et al. [4], who tested the use of HHO as additive fuel on a four cylinder, direct injection, 3567 cc CI engine, with a maximum brake power of 80 kW at 1800 rpm. HHO was generated by means of an in-house-made electrolyser unit (powered with an external supply), and its injection at the intake manifold was regulated by a dedicated ECU. Various engine speeds were tested (from 1200 rpm to 2800 rpm) and the injected amount of HHO was changed accordingly. An average increase of 19.1% in engine torque and an average gain of 14% in SFC were observed. Moreover, HC and CO emissions were lowered of about 5% and 13.5%, respectively. On the same line, Bari et al. [2] investigated the efficiency gain and emissions reduction of an unmodified four cylinder, direct injection, 4010 cc Diesel engine, under the addition of several amounts of HHO. Three power levels (19 kW, 22 kW and 28 kW), at constant speed of 1500 rpm, and HHO flow rates up to 30 LPM were tested, with HHO produced with a commercial HHO generator (Epoch EP-500). The authors observed a maximum increase in Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE) of 8.8%, with a corresponding reduction in SFC of 8.1%. Moreover, HC, CO and CO2 emissions were diminished, while NOx increased (due to peak pressures and temperatures related to the high energy content and flame speed of HHO). Also Premkartikkumar et al. [1] analysed the effects of HHO addition to a single cylinder, direct injection, Diesel engine (rated power of 5.9 kW at 1800 rpm), with HHO produced with an in-house-made generator, powered with an external 12 V source. The engine was tested under different loads and with HHO flow rate from 1 LPM up to 3.3 LPM, whereas the effects of injection time was further analysed in a subsequent work [21]. As observed by other researchers [2,4,17], the effects of HHO addition change upon engine operation and injected amount. Therefore, in some cases, a significant improvement can be only achieved by proper regulation of HHO injection and engine operation. The cited authors indeed observed an increase in BTE of 11.06% at 100% rated load and 3.3 LPM of HHO, while a reduction of 4.15% was obtained at 25% rated load and 1 LPM of HHO. With respect to emissions, at high loads and HHO flow rates, CO, HC and smoke decreased, while CO2 and NOx increased (conversely at low loads and HHO flow rates). Arat et al. [6] studied the performance of an unmodified, four cylinder, direct injection, 3567 cc Diesel engine enriched, on the one hand, with only HHO (5.14 LPM) and, on the other hand, with a mix of HHO and CNG (5.14 LPM and 15.36 LPM, respectively), both with pilot Diesel injections. HHO was generated with an in-house-made device, powered by a 24 V battery, and the tests were performed varying engine speed between 1200 rpm and 2600 rpm. With sole HHO as additive, BTE increased of about 3.4% whereas SFC decreased of 17.4%. The use of HHO and CNG improved previous results: BTE raised of 6.28% and SFC lowered of 27.2%. In all cases, both CO2 and NOx decreased (probably due to less air intake), while CO increased in the former case and decreased in the latter. The aforementioned works confirmed the validity of using HHO as fuel additive to improve both performance and emissions of ICEs. However, their practical use in automotive applications require on-board powering of HHO production devices. Many authors account for the possibility to supply energy to HHO electrolysers through vehicle batteries [2,6,14,15,18], but their performance and, thus, power request depend on the chosen materials and configurations. Manu et al. [13] performed an experimental analysis to find the optimal setup for HHO production through a dry electrolyser. The authors adopted a design of experiment technique to investigate four different factors: (i) space between electrodes (2 mm and 3 mm), (ii) electrolyte type (NaOH and KOH), (iii) electrolyte concentration (20% and 30%) and (iv) electrodes surface roughness (smooth and rough). They found that the best configuration (with 316-L stainless steel electrodes) was with KOH at 30% and with rough electrodes spaced 3 mm. Afterwards, this configuration was considered during tests with a single cylinder, 553 cc CI engine at different HHO flow rates (0.89 LPM, 1.37 LPM, 1.66 LPM and 2 LPM), obtaining an increase in BTE and a decrease in the related SFC. Also Masjuki et al. [15] tested HHO electrolyser performance with different number of electrodes (2 and 3), KOH catalyst concentration (0.5% and 1%) and electrodes gap (10 mm and 50 mm), achieving an optimal design with 3 electrodes spaced 50 mm and with 1% of KOH. Then, the addition of HHO to a single cylinder, direct injection, 815 cc Diesel engine was studied at different engine speeds (from 1200 rpm to 2000 rpm), achieving also in this case a visible gain in power and SFC saving, with a reduction of CO and HC and an increase in NO. Recently, Ismail et al. [22] tested three in-house-made dry cell electrolysers to provide a 1498 cc CI engine with a constant amount of HHO (0.375 LPM). The electrolysers were designed changing voltage and current operation, amount of catalyst (NaOH), number and area of electrodes and stacks. The authors equipped the engine also with a dedicated ECU to control oxygen inlet, so as to ensure fuel savings (which may not be achieved otherwise). Once assessed the best configuration, they investigated the improvements in BTE, SFC and engine emissions. Aydin and Kenanoglu [23] observed the effect of HHO use as fuel additive in both CI and SI engines, without any structural change. The authors initially investigated the most efficient configuration of the electrolyser for HHO production, with different electrolytes. Then, the analysis of the change in performance and emissions related to the use of HHO combined with a dedicated ECU (applied to avoid decrease in volumetric efficiency) was performed. An interesting experimental and theoretical (but not fully detailed) analysis was carried out by Rimkus et al. [16], who applied an HHO generation system on-board of a CI engine, coupled to the engine. From their results, it was pointed out that the use of HHO induces a reduction in engine performance and an increase in fuel consumption, due to the energy demand for HHO production. Also an increase in CO2 and NOx emission was observed. From the investigated literature, it can be noticed that many authors focused on the enhancement of electrolysers performance and the analysis of engines improvements by using HHO as fuel additive. However, a thorough demonstration of the feasibility of running such devices on-board for automotive uses and a rigorous analysis of the whole energetic process are still missing. Indeed, several works propose experimental investigations of the effects related to the HHO use, reporting various efficiency increase and fuel consumption as well as emissions reduction. However, the energy required for HHO production is mainly supplied by external power sources, such as batteries, without taking power at engine output. These observation have been also highlighted by the recent review carried out by Subramanian and Isamil [24]. To bridge this gap, the present work aims at performing a rigorous analysis of the energetic needs related to HHO production through electrolysis, with the engine as main power supply for the electrolyser. In the following sections, the energetic needs related to HHO production are analysed first, followed by an overview on the considered system configuration and the corresponding restrictions, to define the limits for realistic fuel saving conditions. Then, several case studies, based on chosen works addressed in the literature survey, are investigated to prove the validity of the proposed analysis and assess the feasibility of the technological approach."
1,Energetic needs for HHO production,"Hydrogen production can be performed by means of different methodologies, such as gas reforming or water electrolysis, but this latter represents the most suitable method to produce hydrogen with high purity with a rather high efficiency. Water electrolysis is usually performed by providing energy to split water molecules into their components, i.e. hydrogen and oxygen. This process can occurr either at high or low temperatures, through the use of specific electrolytes and ionic agents. Therefore, electrolysers can be generally classified in alkaline, polymer electrolyte membrane, and solid oxide ones [12]."
2,Water electrolysis reaction,"2.1 Water electrolysis reaction Due to their low operating temperature and production cost, as well as their easy manufacturing and management, alkaline electrolysers have been preferred for HHO applications by most of the works available in the literature [4,6,13–15,18,19,22,25]. These type of electrolysers are generally characterized by two or more electrodes (usually made of 316-L stainless steel plates) immersed in distilled water with a dissolved electrolyte (e.g., NaOH or KOH), which promotes the reaction. The water molecules are split due to a potential difference imposed to the electrodes edge and the overall electrochemical reaction is: 2H2O→2H2 +O2 This reaction expresses that for each mole of consumed water, one mole of hydrogen and half a mole of oxygen are produced. Moreover, it is essentially composed by the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), occurring at anode side (positive electrode), and the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER), taking place at cathode side (negative electrode) [12,24,25]: 4OH− →2H2O+O2 +4e− (OER) 4H2O+4e− →4OH− +2H2 (HER) The reactions evolves through different pathways, with production of intermediate elements [25]. Particularly, the HER is firstly characterized by the Volmer reaction: H2O+e− →H ads +OH− (Volmer) where hydrogen atoms H ads are generated. This reaction represents the rate determining step of the whole HER at low potential. Afterwards, either the Heyrovsky or Tafel processes (the former electrochemical, while the latter chemical) can take place [12,24]: H ads +H2O+e− →H2 +OH− (Heyrovsky) 2H ads →H2 (Tafel) The analysis of the former processes clarifies how the production steps of water electrolysis involve more elements rather than only hydrogen and oxygen molecules, particularly hydrogen atoms as intermediate products. This aspect is fundamental to support the assumptions made on HHO nature in Section 2.3."
3,Electrolysis energy demand,"2.2 Electrolysis energy demand The energy required for water electrolysis can be expressed in terms of specific Gibbs free energy change Δ g from reactants to products. Neglecting the entropy change (ideal case) and the effects of temperature, the Gibbs free energy can be expressed in terms of enthalpy variation. Considering and ideal electrolysis process (i.e., with no energy losses), to produce hydrogen from water, the minimum energy that should be given to the electrolyser corresponds to the overall energy attained by the produced H2 molecules. Assuming that the water provided to the electrolyser is in liquid state, the variation in enthalpy can be roughly quantified through the hydrogen HHV. Indeed, this value corresponds to the maximum energy potential attained by hydrogen molecules H2, which can be used through an oxidation reaction (i.e., combustion) by considering water produced in liquid form. Therefore, the minimum energy requested for liquid water electrolysis can be assumed equal to hydrogen HHV. A given volume V H 2 O of distilled water contains n H 2 O water moles, which can be converted in the same amount of H2 moles n H 2 (see previous section). The volume V H 2 occupied by n H 2 depends on the environmental conditions at which the hydrogen is produced and can be evaluated through the ideal gas law, as also suggested by [15]: (1) V H 2 = R ‾ T p n H 2 where R ‾ is the ideal gas constant, whereas T and p are the reference temperature and pressure respectively. Recalling that: (2) n H 2 = n H 2 O = V H 2 O ρ H 2 O M H 2 O Eq. (1) becomes: (3) V H 2 = ρ H 2 O M H 2 O R ‾ T p V H 2 O In Eqs. (2) and (3), the terms ρ H 2 O and M H 2 O are the water density and molar mass, respectively. Assuming Normal Temperature and Pressure (NTP - 20 °C and 1 atm) [26] or Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP - 0 °C and 1 bar) conditions [27], the volume of hydrogen produced from 1 L of water (density 1 kg/L and molar mass 18 g/mol) is about 1.336 m3 (normal) or 1.262 m3 (standard). Recalling that hydrogen has a molar mass of 2 g/mol and an HHV of about 142.18 kJ/mol [6], the ideal energy consumption per 1 m3 of produced hydrogen can be evaluated as: (4) ε H 2 = M H 2 p R ‾ T HHV H 2 which is about 11.82 MJ/m3 (3.28 kWh/m3) in NTP and 12.52 MJ/m3 (3.48 kWh/m3) in STP. Assuming an electrolyser efficiency between 59% and 70% [12], the average gross request of electrical energy at the electrodes can be estimated as 5.28 kWh/m3, in line with the estimate of 4.5 kWh/m3 given by Sapountzi et al. [12]. To express the previous calculations in terms of power demand, the evaluation of the produced hydrogen mass flow m ̇ H 2 should be performed. This can be made considering the Faraday’s law, which relates the provided current I to the hydrogen molar flow n ̇ H 2 [15,19]: (5) n ̇ H 2 = IN c 2 F where F is the Faraday’s constant and N c is the number of the electrolyser cells. This equation links the electronic charge of 2 mol of electrons to each mole of produced H2 (see HER). Hydrogen volumetric flow can be expressed by using n ̇ H 2 instead of n H 2 in Eq. (1): (6) V ̇ H 2 = R ‾ T p IN c 2 F Therefore, at a given current, the related power requested for a certain hydrogen volumetric flow is: (7) P H 2 r = ε H 2 V ̇ H 2 = M H 2 IN c 2 F HHV H 2 From Eq. (7), the ideal power consumption for H2 production seems not to depend directly on the operating conditions (i.e., temperature and pressure). However, it is worth reminding that this calculation represents the net power consumption, without entailing electrolyser efficiency. This latter is indeed strictly dependent on the working conditions, thus influencing the gross power at electrolyser inlet in terms of voltage and current. The previous reasoning is based on the evaluation of the produced hydrogen amount, but since this study entails Oxy-Hydrogen, the required energy estimation should be made directly on HHO."
4,Definition of HHO,"2.3 Definition of HHO Oxy-Hydrogen is usually defined as a stoichiometric mixture of 2/3 of hydrogen and 1/3 of oxygen (by volume) obtained from water electrolysis, but its nature is still unclear. Some works relate the molar fractions to hydrogen and oxygen in their diatomic state (i.e., H2 and O2) [2,3,6,22], while other works claim that they appear in their monoatomic state [4,15,14]. According to these latter, HHO is described as an unstable state of the water, where no atomic bonds are needed to be broken before turning back hydrogen and oxygen into water. When HHO is ignited in the engine combustion chamber, it is assumed that both explosion and implosion occur. The cited works claim that pulverized water aggregates with fuel particles becoming a binary mixture, with water being the core and the fuel the shell (due to density differences). The increase in heat and pressure leads the water to vaporize, with a consequent atomization of the fuel and a better mixing with surrounding oxygen. A more advanced study of HHO was made by Santilli [28], who proposed a peculiar explanation of the monoatomic structure of oxy-hydrogen. In this work, HHO is explicitly distinguished from the conventional Brown’s gas definition of a mixture characterized by diatomic molecules of hydrogen and oxygen. The author investigated several molar masses measurements, underlying the presence in the mixture of single atoms of oxygen (16 amu) in addition to water vapour (18 amu), oxygen molecules (32 amu) and other heavier elements (up to 40 amu). Nevertheless, the presence of single hydrogen atoms was highly expected, although not confirmed by the experiments since the instrumentations were not capable to measure 1 amu elements. An interesting review of the different theories concerning HHO nature is given in [24], highlighting the divergence in the positions of the related researchers. Therefore, the proper definition of HHO composition is not univocal and can change the evaluation of the related molar flow and weight. Therefore, to determine a generalized representation of HHO mixture, the following assumptions are considered: first of all, the presence of other species rather than hydrogen and oxygen is neglected, their moles ratio is assumed stoichiometric (i.e., 2:1) and they are considered both in diatomic and monoatomic state. This latter statement is supported by the analysis of water electrolysis reactions made in Section 2.1. According to these assumptions, the representation of HHO composition is expressed as follows: (8) HHO = 2 3 ζ H 2 + ( 1 - ζ ) H + 1 3 ζ O 2 + ( 1 - ζ ) O where ζ is a parameter representing the hydrogen and oxygen diatomic state fraction: if only diatomic molecules are considered, then ζ = 1 , whereas ζ = 0 in case of purely monoatomic mixture. In general, the state fractions for H 2 and O 2 could differ, but they are here assumed being the same, to keep a stoichiometric ratio for both diatomic and monoatomic states. Intermediate values represent a mixture of elements in both states. Assuming that an amount of elements in monoatomic state can be considered equivalent to an halved amount in diatomic state, Eq. (8) becomes: (9) HHO = x H 2 H 2 + x O 2 O 2 where x H 2 and x O 2 are the molar fractions of hydrogen and oxygen, respectively, and are equal to: (10) x H 2 = 1 + ζ 3 (11) x O 2 = 1 + ζ 6 Therefore, HHO molar weight can be calculated as follows: (12) M HHO = x H 2 M H 2 + x O 2 M O 2 Considering that M H 2 ≈ 2 g/mol and M O 2 ≈ 32 g/mol, Table 1 resumes some of the aforementioned HHO properties according to pure diatomic or pure monoatomic state assumption. The amount of HHO moles can be thus estimated upon the knowledge of the related hydrogen moles amount as follows: (13) n HHO = n H 2 x H 2 From the above comments, it is clear that a precise definition of the HHO mixture is fundamental for the estimation of proper correlation with hydrogen moles, necessary for the estimation of the energy requirements with respect to a given HHO volumetric flow, as illustrated in the following."
5,HHO power request analysis,"2.4 HHO power request analysis From Eq. (13), the mass of H2 available in a given mass of HHO is: (14) m H 2 = M H 2 M HHO x H 2 m HHO and the specific energy of HHO can be then assumed as the equivalent energy of H2 within a unit mass of HHO: (15) HHV HHO = M H 2 M HHO x H 2 HHV H 2 Combining Eqs. (2) and (8) and considering that Eq. (1) can apply also to HHO, the volume of HHO produced from a given amount of distilled water can be evaluated as: (16) V HHO = V H 2 O x H 2 ρ H 2 O M H 2 O R ‾ T p = V H 2 x H 2 and the ideal energy consumption per 1 m3 of produced HHO is: (17) ε HHO = x H 2 M H 2 p R ‾ T HHV H 2 = x H 2 ε H 2 which is about 7.88 MJ/m3 (2.19 kWh/m3) in NTP and 8.35 MJ/m3 (2.32 kWh/m3) in STP for pure diatomic state, and about 3.94 MJ/m3 (1.09 kWh/m3) in NTP and 4.17 MJ/m3 (1.16 kWh/m3) in STP for pure monoatomic state. Faraday’s law is still valid and can be expressed with respect to HHO volumetric flow combining Eqs. (6) and (16): (18) V ̇ HHO = R ‾ T p IN c 2 Fx H 2 The previous equation correlates HHO production to the current provided to the electrolyser. Moreover, the same approach expressed in Eq. (7) can be also applied to compute HHO production power demand: (19) P HHO r = ε HHO V ̇ HHO Through Eq. (19), given a certain HHO volumetric flow, the ideal power requested to the electrolyser is then obtained. However, recalling Eq. (17): (20) P HHO r = x H 2 ε H 2 V ̇ H 2 x H 2 = P H 2 r This result is quite straightforward considering that the power provided to the electrolyser should not depend on the representation of HHO state (either diatomic, monoatomic or a combination of the two) but only on the energy needs related to the involved electrochemical reactions and the overall equivalent amount of produced hydrogen. A verification of the calculations here presented against experimental data taken from the work of Ismail et al. [22] is reported in the Appendix. Such verification confirms the validity of the proposed analysis in assessing the power request for HHO production through electrolysis. In the following section, the energetic investigation is extended including the electrolyser within a typical automotive configuration, with the engine as main power generator."
6,Energetic Analysis of on-board HHO production,"The system layout considered in this work is sketched in Fig. 1 and has been adapted from a preliminary study recently published by the authors [29]. The accounted configuration is designed starting from the same layout available on conventional vehicles, adapted according to schemes also addressed in the literature [1,2,4–6,13,17–19,22]. The system here considered is composed of four main components: an engine (ICE), either CI or SI, an Electric Motor Generator (EMG), a battery, an electrolyser, a mechanical load, a fuel tank and a water tank. The fuel tank and the electrolyser provide the engine with the chemical power attained by the fuel flow m ̇ f (either Diesel, gasoline, or any other fuel) and the HHO flow m ̇ HHO . The engine converts the provided chemical power in mechanical power available at the main shaft. This power is then used to fulfil the load request and to power the EMG, by means of mechanical transmissions. The EMG converts the mechanical power into electric power, to charge the battery. This latter is used to feed the vehicle auxiliaries and also the electrolyser, which uses the provided electric power to convert the inlet water flow m ̇ H 2 O into HHO outlet flow m ̇ HHO . All the power (or, as well, energy) conversions described above involve losses, according to the performance of each considered component. Therefore, a simple evaluation of the required fuel flow can be defined upon the knowledge of the power request at the engine main shaft and components efficiencies, as described in the following section."
7,Fuel consumption evaluation,"3.1 Fuel consumption evaluation The chemical power P chem at the engine inlet can be expressed as: (21) P chem = P f + P HHO where P f and P HHO are the chemical powers attained by the fuel flow and the HHO flow, respectively: (22) P f = m ̇ f LHV f (23) P HHO = m ̇ HHO LHV HHO In Eqs. (22) and (23) the terms LHV f and LHV HHO are the LHV of fuel, the former, and of HHO, the latter. The engine brake power P ICE can be expressed recalling the definition of Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE) η ICE as the ratio between the brake power and the inlet chemical power [1,6,7]: (24) P ICE = P chem η ICE This power amount is immediately available at the main shaft, to cover the load request P L and the EMG gross power P EMG g : (25) P ICE = P L + P EMG g This latter depends on the gross power needed by the battery P BATT g to cover the gross power request at the electrolyser P ELEC g : (26) P EMG g = P BATT g η EMG (27) P BATT g = P ELEC g η BATT where the terms η EMG and η BATT are the EMG and battery efficiencies, respectively. To produce the amount of HHO m ̇ HHO , the gross power consumption at the electrolyser can be expressed upon knowledge of the HHO production power request P HHO r and electrolyser efficiency η ELEC : (28) P ELEC g = P HHO r η ELEC By combining Eqs. (5), (14) and (15), the term P HHO r can be expressed as: (29) P HHO r = m ̇ HHO HHV HHO where the term HHV HHO is the HHV of the HHO (see Eq. (15)). Defining α as the ratio between hydrogen LHV and HHV and considering that Eq. (14) holds also for LHV values, the following relationship between HHO chemical power used in the engine and power request for HHO production is obtained: (30) P HHO = m ̇ HHO α HHV HHO = α P HHO r Combining Eqs. ()()()(26)–(28), the gross power request at the EMG can be finally expressed in terms of the required power for HHO production: (31) P EMG g = P HHO r η ELEC η BATT η EMG = P HHO r η aux where η aux is the overall efficiency of the auxiliaries used for HHO production. The amount of fuel flow required by engine operation can be now evaluated by introducing Eqs. (21), (22), (24), (30) and (31) in Eq. (25): (32) m ̇ f = P L LHV f η ICE + P HHO r LHV f 1 η ICE η aux - α Without the use of HHO (or any other additive) during engine operation, the achieved fuel consumption m ̇ f 0 can be evaluated as: (33) m ̇ f 0 = P L 0 LHV f η ICE 0 where P L 0 and η ICE 0 are the related load request and BTE. Therefore, the percentage variation in fuel consumption can be expressed as: (34) % Δ m ̇ f = m ̇ f - m ̇ f 0 m ̇ f 0 · 100 and recalling Eqs. (32) and (33), it becomes: (35) % Δ m ̇ f = η ICE 0 P L 0 P L η ICE + P HHO r 1 η aux η ICE - α - 1 · 100 A qualitative representation of the overall energy flows among the considered components is given through the Sankey diagram sketched in Fig. 2 . Such representation refers to a generic operation and the arrows dimension should be taken as a reference example. It can be observed that the fuel represents the only inlet energy flow to the system, and the engine losses are the main cause of overall efficiency reduction. Therefore, any increase in engine efficiency can lead to a consequent reduction in fuel consumption. If HHO is used to this scope, a real benefit can be achieved only if the energy amount required for HHO production is lower than the energy saved through an increase in engine efficiency. This condition is thoroughly discussed in the following section."
8,Fuel saving condition,"3.2 Fuel saving condition Under HHO addition, the condition at which fuel saving is achieved can be clearly represented as: (36) m ̇ f < m ̇ f 0 or in terms of percentage fuel consumption variation as: (37) % Δ m ̇ f < 0 Recalling Eq. (35), Eq. (37) can be rearranged and expressed in terms of BTEs as follows: (38) η ICE > η ICE 0 η aux P HHO r + P L η aux P L 0 + α P HHO r η ICE 0 or, as well, in their percentage variation: (39) % Δ η ICE > P L - P L 0 η aux + P HHO r 1 - α η aux η ICE 0 η aux P L 0 + α P HHO r η ICE 0 where: (40) % Δ η ICE = η ICE - η ICE 0 η ICE 0 · 100 It can be observed that the term at the right side of Eq. (39) depends on the operating condition (in terms of power request and injected HHO) and components performance (in terms of engine BTE without HHO injection and auxiliaries efficiency). This term is here lumped in the parameter δ , obtaining: (41) % Δ η ICE > δ The condition % Δ η ICE = δ represents the case at which, with HHO addition, no variation of fuel consumption is achieved, i.e., % Δ m ̇ f = 0 . Therefore, the term δ is thus named Unchanged Fuel Consumption Limit (UFCL) and represents the percentage increase in engine BTE through which the fuel consumption remains unchanged (i.e., m ̇ f = m ̇ f 0 ). Fuel saving is thus achieved if the percentage gain in BTE obtained with the addition of HHO is higher than this value, otherwise a higher fuel flow is required to cope with load request and HHO production. Noteworthy, the UFCL value does not depend on the fuel type since no information related to fuel energy content (e.g., LHV f ) is required. Therefore, this limit is only influenced by components performance, HHO flow and load request. In the addressed literature, many authors investigate the effects of HHO injection either with fixed power request (i.e., constant torque and speed) [1–3,13,19,21] or engine speed (i.e., variable torque at given speed) [4,6,14,15,17,18,22]. Hence, the UFCL evaluation shall be always characterized according to the considered operation. 3.2.1 Constant power operation In this case, the power request is kept unchanged while comparing the engine performance with and without HHO addition. Therefore, the condition P L = P L 0 applies and the UFCL expression becomes: (42) δ cp = P HHO r 1 - α η aux η ICE 0 η aux P L 0 + α P HHO r η ICE 0 Introducing κ = P HHO r / P L 0 as the ratio between the power required for HHO production and the power request, Eq. (42) can be further simplified: (43) δ cp = 1 - α η aux η ICE 0 η aux 1 κ + α η ICE 0 From the previous equation, two limit cases can be identified focusing on η aux . The first one is obtained with η aux = 0 , representing the extreme case at which the losses related to auxiliaries operation are predominant. At this condition δ cp → + ∞ , meaning that the poorer is the auxiliaries performance, the greater becomes the fuel consumption and, thus, the limit at which fuel saving can be achieved. The opposite case is instead obtained with η aux = 1 , at which an ideal operation of the auxiliaries is considered. This condition is of particular interest since it represents the lowest UFCL value achievable at a given operating condition and engine performance. In this case, the UFLC value δ cp id is: (44) δ cp id = 1 - α η ICE 0 1 κ + α η ICE 0 A qualitative representation of δ cp id as function of η ICE 0 and κ is given in Figs. 3 and 4 , respectively. In these figures, the UFCL at constant power operation is represented through solid blue lines, whereas the other curves refer to the UFCL at constant speed operation (illustrated in the following section). From the trends, it can be clearly observed that the UFCL decreases with a better performing engine (i.e., at higher η ICE 0 ), while it increases with greater amount of HHO being injected at a given power request (i.e., higher κ ). In both cases, lower and upper bounds are represented (at both left and right side y axes). With respect to Fig. 3: (45) δ cp id η ICE 0 = 0 = κ (46) δ cp id η ICE 0 = 1 = κ 1 - α 1 + α κ the upper bound in Eq. (45) represents the case at which the engine losses fully absorb the inlet chemical energy of the fuel, while the lower bound in Eq. (46) is associated to absence of engine losses. In both cases, the limits are proportional to the amount of HHO injected as additive. Nevertheless, the right hand limit has been introduced only for mathematical analysis purposes, since the maximum theoretical engine efficiency that could be achieved is represented by the Carnot limit (dashed vertical black line). Observing Fig. 4, the following limits are shown: (47) δ cp id κ = 0 = 0 (48) δ cp id κ → + ∞ → 1 α η ICE 0 - 1 It is obvious that if no HHO addition is considered ( κ = 0 ), any increase in engine BTE will improve the fuel consumption. When adding HHO, the UFCL increases but its growth is limited, since for κ → + ∞ the UFCL tends to a finite value. 3.2.2 Constant speed operation Differently from the previous condition of constant power, constant speed operation implies that engine performance is investigated keeping unchanged the engine speed ω , whereas engine brake torque Tq changes. In this case the following condition ω = ω 0 applies, while Tq ≠ Tq 0 . Thus, UFCL can be expressed as: (49) δ cs = Tq - Tq 0 ω 0 η aux + P HHO r 1 - α η aux η ICE 0 η aux Tq 0 ω 0 + α P HHO r η ICE 0 Introducing the coefficient τ = Tq / Tq 0 and recalling Eq. (43) and the term κ , Eq. (49) becomes: (50) δ cs = δ cp + τ - 1 1 + α κ η ICE 0 The previous equation expresses δ cs as linearly dependent on δ cp . The other term appearing on the right side strictly depends on the value assumed by τ , which can be either positive ( τ ⩾ 1 ) or negative ( τ < 1 ). Nevertheless, many authors observed that the addition of HHO brings an increase in engine torque at constant speed [4,6,14,15,18,22], thus implying that τ is positive. This means that, at given engine performance and HHO injected amount, the UFCL can be higher if operating at constant speed rather than constant power. The previous conclusion can be motivated considering that, in such case, more torque is provided to the load, increasing the engine brake power and thus requiring more fuel. Focusing on the auxiliaries efficiency, the limit cases with η aux = 0 leads to δ cs → + ∞ (since δ cp → + ∞ ), whereas for η aux = 1 the UFLC value δ cs id is: (51) δ cs id = δ cp id + τ - 1 1 + α κ η ICE 0 As done for δ cp id , also δ cs id is qualitatively represented as function of η ICE 0 and κ in Figs. 3 and 4. Also in this case, the UFCL decreases at higher η ICE 0 values, and increases with higher κ values. Lower and upper bounds are as well represented, obtaining for Fig. 3: (52) δ cs id η ICE 0 = 0 = τ - 1 + κ (53) δ cs id η ICE 0 = 1 = τ - 1 + κ ( 1 - α ) 1 + α κ and for Fig. 4: (54) δ cs id κ = 0 = τ - 1 (55) δ cs id κ → + ∞ → 1 α η ICE 0 - 1 Nevertheless, the upper and lower bounds depend also on τ . If τ < 1 , δ cs id < δ cp id , otherwise δ cs id > δ cp id for τ > 1 . As previously stated, τ greater than 1 implies that a higher torque is provided to the load/driveline, inducing and increase in the fuel saving limit. On the other hand, when τ is lower than 1, less torque means that less power is provided at the same speed to the load/driveline and the energy surplus is then used by the electrolyser. In the following section, the application of the UFCL to specific case studies taken from the literature is performed, in order to assess the feasibility of running on-board HHO production systems to achieve fuel reduction."
9,Results on case studies from literature,"The case studies here analysed are based on the experimental investigations reported in the works of Premkartikkumar et al. [1], Manu et al. [13], Wang et al. [3], Bari et al. [2] and Falahat et al. [18]. An overview on engine type and operation, as well as tested HHO flow rate and obtained efficiencies are reported in Table 2 for each considered work. For further details on the performed experiments, the reader is addressed to the cited works. All the parameters required for the energetic analysis can be found in Table 3 , with reference to the values already reported in Tables 1 and the results illustrated in the Appendix. The power request for HHO production is evaluated through Eq. (19) upon the knowledge of HHO volumetric flow (from the literature works) and ideal energy consumption (Eq. (17)). The BTE increase evaluated through the literature data is firstly compared to the ideal UFCL, characterized in both pure diatomic and pure monoatomic states by means of Eq. (44) for constant power operation and Eq. (51) for constant speed operation. This analysis gives a first verification on the possibility to achieve fuel saving under the considered configuration. Afterwards, the comparison is performed with respect to a real UFCL calculated through Eqs. (42) and (49), for constant power and constant speed, respectively, and the corresponding fuel consumption variation is computed through Eq. (35). The first case study is based on the work of Premkartikkumar et al. [1] that has been already discussed in Section 1. The energetic analysis is here performed assuming full power operation (i.e, constant power of 5.9 kW) with a HHO flow of 3 LPM. At this condition, the increase in BTE is about 11.06% (from the data reported in Table 2). The ideal UFCL in pure diatomic state corresponds to 5.23%, whereas in pure monoatomic state it is about 2.63%. Both limits are below the reported BTE increase, confirming the possibility to achieve a theoretical fuel consumption reduction. Assuming an auxiliary efficiency of about 54.4%, the real UFCL limits for diatomic and monoatomic states become 10.76% and 5.41%. Also in this case, the BTE percentage increase is above these limits, and the corresponding fuel consumption reductions are 0.28% (pure diatomic) and 5.12% (pure monoatomic). As discussed in Section 2.3, since the HHO mixture may behave in between the two pure states, an intermediate value should be considered. Therefore, the average fuel consumption reduction is assessed as 2.7%. The second case study refers to the experimental investigation of Manu et al. [13], also described as the previous one in Section 1. The engine operates at a constant power of 3.7 kW with HHO flow of 2 LPM. With respect to the values reported in Table 2, the achieved BTE increase is about 9.34%, which is higher than both ideal UFCLs, that are 5.08% in pure diatomic state and 2.56% in pure monoatomics state. Hence, fuel saving is theoretically possible. However, since the real UFCLs are 10.92% and 5.51% in pure diatomic and pure monoatomic states, respectively, in the first case there is an increase in fuel consumption of about 1.47%, whereas in the second case the fuel consumption diminished of about 3.54%. Therefore, the behaviour is more prone to fuel saving, with an average fuel consumption reduction of 1.03%. The investigation related to the third case study is based on the results carried out by Wang et al. [3], where a constant power operation (24.5 kW) and variable HHO flow rates, ranging from 0 LPM up to 70 LPM with 10 LPM steps, are applied. The comparison of the BTE increase with respect to ideal and real UFCLs under both pure diatomic and pure monoatomic states is illustrated in Fig. 5 a, and the related fuel consumption variations are reported in Fig. 5b. From the achieved results it can be observed that, for HHO flows equal or lower than 40 LPM, no fuel saving can be theoretically achieved. Both ideal UFCLs are exceeded only for HHO flows equal or higher than 60 LPM, but no proper fuel saving could be achieved when addressing real conditions. Indeed, the average fuel consumption variation, sketched as a yellow dashed line in Fig. 5b, shows a large increase with a maximum of 17.7% at 40 LPM and oscillating around 10% at higher HHO flow rates. The engine performance changes due to HHO addition illustrated in the work of Bari et al. [2] are considered for the fourth test case analysis. As described in Section 1, the experimental investigation was performed at constant power operation with three different values, that are 19 kW, 22 kW and 28 kW. The energetic analysis results for each load value are reported in Figs. 6–8 , respectively. In each figure, the comparison of the BTE increase with respect to ideal and real UFCLs (a) as well as fuel consumption variations (b) under both pure diatomic and pure monoatomic states are illustrated with respect to the specific operating condition. The results of Fig. 6a for a constant load of 19 kW show the BTE variation almost superimposed to the ideal UFCL at pure monoatomic state. The direct consequence is the impossibility to achieve fuel saving at any investigated HHO flow rate, as proved by the results in Fig. 6b, where a linear increase in average fuel consumption is visible. Concerning results for 22 kW constant load, Fig. 7a shows that, for low HHO flow rates (below 5 LPM), fuel savings could be achieved, since the BTE increase is higher than all the reported UFCLs. Indeed, an average reduction in fuel consumption of about 1.45% is reported for a HHO flow rate of 2.5 LPM (see Fig. 7b). For higher HHO flow rates, the behaviour changes, since the BTE increase rate is lower than the increment in both ideal and real UFCLs. The 28 kW constant power condition case is instead much similar to the 19 kW case, with a BTE variation superimposed to the ideal UFCL at pure monoatomic state (Fig. 8a) and a linearly increasing average fuel consumption (Fig. 8b). Therefore, no fuel saving can be achieved at all also in this case. The last investigated case study is related to the experimental activity carried out by Falahat et al. [18], who tested a gasoline fuelled engine at different speeds and HHO flow rates (see Table 2). In this case, the constant speed operation is thus considered and the related results are presented in Figs. 9–11 for HHO flow rates of 1LPM, 1.5 LPM and 2 LPM, respectively. Each figure illustrates the comparison of the BTE increase with respect to ideal and real UFCLs (a) as well as fuel consumption variations (b) under both pure diatomic and pure monoatomic states at different engine speeds. For all the investigated HHO flow rates, fuel savings can be largely achieved since the BTE increase is always over the real UFCLs at any engine speed. Moreover, the higher is the HHO flow rate, the grater is the fuel consumption reduction. Nevertheless, it is worth observing that the fuel consumption reduction does not monotonically decrease with respect to increasing engine speeds, but an optimal operation is observed. For 1 LPM HHO flow, a maximum reduction of about 10% is found at 1550 rpm, whereas higher values are found at 1750 rpm for both 1.5 LPM and 2 LPM HHO flow rates, that are 10.7% and 12.7%, respectively. Table 4 summarizes the results achieved with respect to the five addressed case studies. For those involving multiple HHO flow rates and engine operating conditions (i.e. [3,2,18]), the values reported in the table are computed as the average of those illustrated in the figures related to each case study. From these results, it can be observed that with small engines and HHO flows (i.e., below 1000 cc and 5 LPM) fuel saving could be achieved, whereas this condition seems not realistic with bigger displacement and higher HHO flow rates (i.e., above 4000 cc and 10 LPM). The maximum average fuel consumption reduction for Diesel engine is achieved for the first case study [1], which is about 2.7% at 5.9 kW and 3 LPM of HHO. For gasoline engines, the maximum reduction is 12.7% (for 1750 rpm and 2 LPM of HHO), with an overall average saving right below 7% [18]. It can be concluded that fuel savings may be achieved through on-board HHO production and injection by taking useful energy directly form the engine. Nevertheless, a proper reduction in fuel consumptions may not always be possible since it strictly depends on different factors: (i) the considered system (i.e., being a Diesel or a gasoline fuelled engine with a specific displacement), (ii) the operating condition (i.e., constant load or speed) and (iii) the amount of injected HHO. As also observed in other literature works, although theoretically possible, proper fuel savings can be practically achieved upon suitable management of engine operation and HHO injection, such as the optimization of pressure ratio and spark advance."
10,Conclusions,"The present work illustrates a theoretical study on the energetic requirements related to the on-board production of Oxy-Hydrogen (HHO) for internal combustion engine systems. The main objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of using HHO under realistic operating conditions, assuming HHO produced through eletrolysis, with the electrolyser directly connected to the engine. A thorough overview of the available literature pointed out the lack in a rigorous analysis of the whole energetic process and the discordant results related to the definition of HHO nature and its use in internal combustion engines. Thus, the key novelties with respect to the available literature introduced with the proposed work are related to: (i) the assumption and modelling of HHO as a stoichiometric mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in both monoatomic and diatomic states, and (ii) the definition of the Unchanged Fuel Composition Limit (UFCL) as indicator representing the minimum increase in engine Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE) at which no fuel consumption variation is achieved with a specific HHO amount. Concerning HHO composition, the proposed assumption was proved valid upon experimental data available in the literature, and the energetic analysis was then performed according to both HHO diatomic ad monoatomic states. The UFCL was firstly analysed from a theoretical point of view, by addressing two different engine operations, one at constant torque and speed (i.e., power output) and the other at constant speed only. Afterwards, five case studies have been addressed, based on experimental activities available in the literature on both Diesel and gasoline fuelled engines. From the obtained results it was pointed out that fuel savings are more likely to be achieved with small engines and HHO flows, but further improvements could be attained by introducing proper engine control logics and optimized operating conditions. Further activities can entail the detailed modelling of the effects of HHO addition inside the combustion chamber and the performance of dedicated experimental tests to investigate fuel consumption variation with the engine equipped with an on-board HHO generator."
