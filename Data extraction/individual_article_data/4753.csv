0,Introduction,"Oxidative stress is defined as an excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cannot be counteracted by the action of antioxidants [1]. Aberrant production of ROS including superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen can cause damage to major cellular components such as lipids, proteins and DNA, leading to cell death through necrosis or apoptosis [2]. The body encloses complex antioxidant defense systems that rely on both endogenous enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants [3]. Nonetheless, the supplement of exogenous antioxidants can improve the organism's capacity to reduce oxidative stress that cannot be fully amended by the intervention of endogenous antioxidant defenses [4]. Phenolic compounds, the secondary metabolites in plant kingdom, are an essential part of human diet with many valuable bioactivities including antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective activities [5]. Gallic acid (GA), 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid, is one kind of phenolic acid that has been widely used as an antioxidant in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Existing studies have shown that GA and its ester derivatives (e.g. propyl gallate, octyl gallate and lauryl gallate) possess numerous therapeutic properties, such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antimelanogenic, antiviral, anti-allergic, neuroprotective, nephroprotective and hepatoprotective properties [6]. Natural polysaccharides are widely employed in food industry due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability and non-toxicity. Although natural polysaccharides have been demonstrated to possess certain antioxidant activity, their antioxidant potential is incomparable to the antioxidant capacity of GA [7]. In recent years, several attempts have been made to graft GA onto different polysaccharides (e.g. chitosan, carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS), chitosan oligosaccharide and inulin) to increase the bioactivities and extend the applications of polysaccharides [8–14]. The synthesized GA grafted polysaccharides (GA-g-polysaccharides) exhibit several valuable bioactivities, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, enzyme inhibitory, prebiotic and calcium oxalate crystals formation inhibitory effects [15–20]. Moreover, GA-g-polysaccharides have wide applications in the fields of active packaging [21–25], edible coating [26,27], encapsulation [17,28] and bioadsorption [29,30]. Notably, existing studies have mainly focused on GA-g-chitosan, however, studies on the other GA-g-polysaccharides are very limited. CMCS, a water-soluble derivative of chitosan, has many unique properties (e.g. high viscosity, good film-forming ability, biocompatibility, biodegradability and non-toxicity) [31]. Based on the type of substitution, CMCS can be further divided into O-CMCS, N,O-CMCS and N-CMCS. O-substitution is favored when the carboxymethylation is carried out by reacting chitosan with monochloroacetic acid in isopropanol/aqueous sodium hydroxide under lower temperature, while N-substitution predominates in higher temperature [32]. Till now, only a few studies have focused on the grafting of GA onto CMCS [14,33]. Yu et al. [14] grafted GA onto N,O-CMCS through a carbodiimide-mediated coupling method and found the conjugate could form self-assembled nanoparticles with Fe2+ through coordination effect. However, the chemical coupling reagents used are much expensive and environmentally disadvantageous. Liu et al. [33] applied a free radical-induced grafting approach (a simple, economical and eco-friendly method) to conjugate GA with N,O-CMCS. The conjugation of GA with N,O-CMCS probably occurred at C-2 position via the formation of amide linkage. The synthesized GA-g-CMCS exhibited strong free radical scavenging activity. Nonetheless, the antioxidant activity of GA-g-CMCS has not been evaluated by cellular assay till now. Considering O-CMCS possesses more free amino groups than N,O-CMCS, O-CMCS can provide more available grafting positions for GA. Therefore, GA was grafted onto O-CMCS through a free radical-mediated method by using ascorbic acid/hydrogen peroxide (AA/H2O2) redox pair in this study. The obtained GA-g-CMCS was then characterized by several instrumental methods. Moreover, the protective effect of GA-g-CMCS against H2O2-induced oxidative damage in RAW264.7 cells was evaluated for the first time."

3,Synthesis of GA-g-CMCS,"2.2 Synthesis of GA-g-CMCS GA-g-CMCS was synthesized according to the method of Liu et al. [34] with some modifications. Firstly, 0.5 g of O-CMCS was thoroughly dissolved in 50 mL distilled water in a 500 mL three-necked round-bottom flask. Afterwards, 1.32 g of AA and 0.5 g of GA were added into the flask and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 6.0. A slow stream of nitrogen gas was allowed to pass through the reactor for 60 min. Then, 0.375 mL of 10 mol/L H2O2 solution was added into the reactor to initiate the reaction. The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 24 h in a continuous stream of nitrogen gas. The obtained reaction mixture was dialyzed against distilled water by 12,000 Da molecular weight cutoff membranes for 72 h and lyophilized to obtain GA-g-CMCS. The grafting ratio of GA-g-CMCS was determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu assay and expressed as mg of GA equivalents per g (mg GAE/g) of the conjugate [11]."
4,Characterization of GA-g-CMCS,"2.3 Characterization of GA-g-CMCS 2.3.1 Thin layer chromatography (TLC) TLC analysis was performed to detect whether the conjugate contained free GA [35]. Briefly, 2 μL of 5 mg/mL sample solution was spotted onto a silica gel GF254 plate (5 cm × 20 cm) and eluted with chloroform-ethyl acetate-acetic acid (50:50:1, v/v) at room temperature. The developed plate was exposed in an iodine-saturated chamber for 10 min. 2.3.2 UV–vis spectroscopy The UV–vis spectrum was recorded by scanning sample solution (0.1 mg/mL in distilled water) from 200 to 800 nm on a Lambda 35 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Ltd., MA, USA). 2.3.3 Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy The FT-IR spectrum was recorded on a continuous scan Varian 670 spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) in the frequency range of 4000–400 cm−1. The dried sample was grinded with potassium bromide powder and pressed into pellet for spectrometric measurement. 2.3.4 Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy The 1H NMR spectrum of the sample solution was recorded on an AVANCE-600 spectrometer (Bruker Inc., Karlsruhe, Germany) at 25 °C and operating frequency of 600 MHz. Sample (5 mg) was dissolved in 0.45 mL of D2O. 2.3.5 Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) The XRD pattern was recorded on a D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation at the voltage of 40 kV and the current of 40 mA. The scattered radiation was detected in the angular range of 5–80° at scanning speed of 1°/min. 2.3.6 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The morphology was observed by a GeminiSEM 300 equipment (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) at the accelerating voltage of 5 kV and the magnification of 1000×. Sample was mounted on a metal stub and sputtered with gold before observation."
5,Determination of the antioxidant activity in vitro of GA-g-CMCS,"2.4 Determination of the antioxidant activity in vitro of GA-g-CMCS 2.4.1 DPPH radicals scavenging activity The DPPH radical scavenging activity was determined by the method of Liu et al. [36]. Briefly, 3 mL of 0.4 mmol/L DPPH methanol solution was mixed with 1 mL of sample solution with different concentrations (0.5–2.5 mg/mL). The mixture was shaken vigorously and allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. The absorbance of reaction solution was measured at 517 nm. The IC50 value represented the concentration of the sample that caused 50% inhibition of DPPH radical formation. 2.4.2 Reducing power The reducing power was determined according to the method of Liu et al. [36]. The mixture containing 2.5 mL of sample solution with different concentrations (0.5–2.5 mg/mL), 2.5 mL of 0.2 mol/L sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.6) and 2.5 mL of 1% (w/v) potassium ferricyanide was incubated at 50 °C for 20 min. Afterwards, 0.5 mL of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid was added and the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min. Then, 2.5 mL of the supernatant was mixed with 2.5 mL of deionized water and 0.5 mL of 0.1% (w/v) ferric chloride. The absorbance of reaction mixture was measured at 700 nm. The IC50 value represented the concentration of the sample that provided 0.5 of absorbance."
6,Cell culture,"2.5 Cell culture RAW264.7 cells, a mouse macrophage cell line, were purchased from the Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL of penicillin and 100 μg/mL of streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C."
7,Determination of the cytotoxicity of GA-g-CMCS,"2.6 Determination of the cytotoxicity of GA-g-CMCS The cytotoxicity of GA-g-CMCS was measured by the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay [37]. Briefly, RAW264.7 cells were seeded into 96-well microplate with a density of 1 × 105 cells/mL. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, the cells were treated with different concentrations (25–400 μg/mL) of GA-g-CMCS at 37 °C for 12 h. Then, 10 μL of CCK-8 solution was added, which was followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Finally, each plate was read immediately at 450 nm by a Multiskan FC microplate reader (Thermo, MA, USA)."
8,Determination of the protective effect of GA-g-CMCS against H2O2-induced oxidative damage in RAW264.7 cells,"2.7 Determination of the protective effect of GA-g-CMCS against H2O2-induced oxidative damage in RAW264.7 cells 2.7.1 Experimental design To evaluate the protective effect of GA-g-CMCS against H2O2-induced oxidative damage, RAW264.7 cells with a density of 1 × 105 cells/mL were inoculated at 37 °C for 4 h. Then, the cells were treated with different concentrations (100, 200 and 400 μg/mL) of GA-g-CMCS at 37 °C for 12 h. Afterwards, the cells were further treated with 1.4 mM of H2O2 (diluted in culture medium) at 37 °C for 2 h [38]. The obtained cells were subjected to following measurements. 2.7.2 Cell viability The cell viability of RAW264.7 cells treated with GA-g-CMCS and H2O2 was determined by CCK-8 assay. Briefly, 10 μL of CCK-8 solution was added into the cells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The absorbance of the medium was detected at 450 nm. 2.7.3 Apoptosis analysis Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry using the Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After treatment with GA-g-CMCS and H2O2, RAW264.7 cells were collected, washed twice with PBS and re-suspended in binding buffer with a density of 1 × 105 cells/mL. The cell suspension (100 μL) was stained with 5 μL Annexin V-FITC and 5 μL propidium iodide (PI) at room temperature for 15 min in the dark. The stained cells were analyzed on a FACSAria SORP flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, NJ, USA). 2.7.4 Membrane integrity The plasma membrane integrity of RAW264.7 cells was evaluated by measuring the leakage of LDH in the cell supernatant [39]. Briefly, after treatment with GA-g-CMCS and H2O2, RAW264.7 cells were centrifuged at 12,000g and 4 °C for 15 min. Then, LDH activity in the supernatant was determined by the commercially available assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions and expressed as unit per liter (U/L). 2.7.5 Intracellular ROS production The formation of intracellular ROS was detected by using the oxidation sensitive fluorescent probe of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA) [37]. After treatment with GA-g-CMCS and H2O2, RAW264.7 cells were labeled with 10 μmol/L of DCFH-DA at 37 °C for 20 min in the dark. Then, the cells were washed three times with serum-free cell culture medium to sufficiently remove DCFH-DA that did not enter the cells. The fluorescence intensity was measured by a Tecan Infinite M200 PRO plate reader (Tecan Deutschland GmbH, Crailsheim, Germany) at the excitation wavelength of 488 nm and the emission wavelength of 510 nm. 2.7.6 Intracellular SOD, CAT and GSH-PX activity and MDA content After treatment with GA-g-CMCS and H2O2, RAW264.7 cells were lysed with a buffer supplemented with 1% phenylmethyl sulfonylfluoride and 1% tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, and then centrifuged at 12,000g and 4 °C for 15 min [39]. Protein content was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The activity of SOD, CAT and GSH-Px as well as the content of MDA were determined by commercially available assay kits according to the manufacturer's instructions. The activity of enzymes was expressed as unit per milligram protein (U/mg) and the MDA level was expressed as nanomole per milligram protein (nmol/mg)."
9,Statistical analysis,2.8 Statistical analysis Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The Duncan test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for multiple comparisons by the SPSS 13.0 software package. Difference was considered to be statistically significant if p < .05.
10,Results and discussion,
11,Synthesis and characterization of GA-g-CMCS,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization of GA-g-CMCS 3.1.1 Synthesis of GA-g-CMCS In this study, GA was grafted onto O-CMCS through a free radical-mediated method by using AA/H2O2 redox pair. The synthetic mechanisms of phenolic grafted polysaccharides in AA/H2O2 redox system have been revealed by Liu et al. [34]. As shown in Fig. 1 , AA is a water-soluble ketolactone with two ionizable hydroxyl groups (3–OH and 2–OH), which can be dissociated to produce ascorbate monoanion (AscH−, pK1 = 4.1) and ascorbate dianion (Asc2−, pK2 = 11.6). At physiological pH level, AscH− is the dominant form and can undergo two consecutive one-electron oxidation reactions to form first ascorbate radical (Asc −) and then dehydroascorbic acid (DHA). When H2O2 is presented in the reaction system, it can accelerate the oxidation of AA to generate more Asc −. The resultant Asc − can abstract hydrogen atoms from O-CMCS and produce macro radicals along the backbone chains, which can further react with GA to produce GA-g-CMCS. The grafting ratio of GA-g-CMCS was determined as 60.8 mg GAE/g by Folin-Ciocalteu method. Liu et al. [33] conjugated GA onto N,O-CMCS and found the grafting ratio of the conjugate was 45.8 mg GAE/g. By contrast, the relatively higher grafting ratio of GA-g-CMCS obtained in this study was probably due to O-CMCS had more grafting positions than N,O-CMCS. Afterwards, the obtained GA-g-CMCS was characterized by different instruments to confirm the successful grafting. 3.1.2 Characterization of GA-g-CMCS GA, O-CMCS and GA-g-CMCS were first subjected to TLC analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A, free GA migrated a certain distance on TLC, showing a big yellow spot on the plate. O-CMCS presented no yellow spot on the thin layer plate, whereas GA-g-CMCS showed a small yellow spot on the base line of the plate without any migration. This indicated that GA was successfully grafted onto O-CMCS and no free GA was presented in the conjugate. Similar phenomena were observed when GA-g-chitosan was analyzed by TLC [17,35]. The UV–vis spectra of GA, O-CMCS and GA-g-CMCS are represented in Fig. 2B. GA displayed two characteristic peaks at 215 and 267 nm, which were attributed to the π system of benzene ring [15]. However, no absorption peak was observed in the UV–vis spectrum of O-CMCS due to the lack of chromophore. The grafting of GA onto O-CMCS resulted in an absorption peak at 269 nm, indicating the absorption peak of GA shifted to a longer wavelength. The bathochromic effect was caused by the lower energy required for the n-π* and π-π* transitions in the conjugate [40]. Many other researchers also observed obvious red shifts in the UV–vis spectra of GA-g-inulin and GA-g-chitosan [11,15,25,40]. The FT-IR spectra of GA, O-CMCS and GA-g-CMCS are shown in Fig. 2C. GA showed characteristic bands at 3368 and 3287 cm−1 (O − H stretching on benzene ring), 1703 cm−1 (CO stretching of carboxyl groups), 1618 and 1541 cm−1 (CC stretching of aromatic ring), 1200–1300 cm−1 (CO/CC stretching), and 1026 cm−1 (CH deformation of aromatic ring) [11,15]. O-CMCS showed two characteristic bands at 3421 and 2929 cm−1, corresponding to OH/NH stretching and CH stretching, respectively. Two bands at 1591 and 1414 cm−1 were assigned to the asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching of COO− groups in carboxylic acid salt, respectively [14,33]. Meanwhile, the band at 1591 cm−1 overlapped with NH bending of primary amine [11]. Other bands at 1325 and 1073 cm−1 corresponded to CN stretching of amide III and CO stretching of secondary hydroxyl group (CHOH in cyclic alcohols), respectively. However, the CO stretching band (at about 1030 cm−1) corresponding to the primary hydroxyl group (CH2 OH in primary alcohols) was not clearly detected, suggesting the carboxymethyl substitution mainly occurred at the C6OH position of chitosan [41]. Notably, GA-g-CMCS exhibited a different FT-IR spectrum with O-CMCS. The band at 1591 cm−1 significant decreased and a new band appeared at 1640 cm−1 (CO stretching of amide I), indicating the conversion of primary amine to secondary amine due to the covalent linkage between the amino group of O-CMCS and the carboxyl group of GA through amide bond [42]. Other researchers also observed a new band appeared at about 1730 cm−1 in the FT-IR spectrum of GA-g-chitosan, which was assigned to CO stretching of carbonyl group due to the formation of ester bond between the hydroxyl group of O-CMCS and the carboxyl group of GA [11,42]. However, the characteristic band of ester bond was not observed in the FT-IR spectrum of GA-g-CMCS, suggesting the grafting positions between GA and polysaccharides were related to the type of polysaccharides. The successful grafting of GA onto O-CMCS was also confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. As presented in Fig. 3A, GA only exhibited a single peak at 7.1 ppm that corresponded to the phenyl protons on benzene ring [42]. In the 1H NMR spectrum of O-CMCS, two characteristic peaks at 3.1 and 2.1 ppm were assigned to H-2 of d-glucosamine unit and N-acetyl protons of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine unit, respectively. The multiple peaks at 3.4–4.0 ppm corresponded to H-3 to H-6 of O-CMCS. However, the H-1 of O-CMCS was not clearly detected due to the overlap with the signal of solvent proton. As compared to O-CMCS, GA-g-CMCS presented a new peak at 7.1 ppm, which was assigned to the phenyl protons of GA. The similar changes were also observed in the 1H NMR spectra of GA-g-chitosan and GA-g-CMCS [11,14,35,42]. The crystallographic structures of GA, O-CMCS and GA-g-CMCS were measured by XRD and shown in Fig. 3B. GA exhibited several sharp diffraction peaks, demonstrating it was a crystalline compound. However, both O-CMCS and GA-g-CMCS showed an amorphous state without any crystalline peaks. In addition, the XRD pattern of GA-g-CMCS was similar with that of O-CMCS, indicating the grafting of GA did not significantly change the crystallinity of O-CMCS. However, some researchers found the semi-crystalline structures of chitosan and inulin were greatly destroyed by grafting with GA, which was because the conjugation of GA remarkably disrupted the inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds in polysaccharide network [11,15,40,42]. Therefore, the XRD patterns of GA-g-polysaccharides were related to the type of polysaccharides. The surface morphology of GA, O-CMCS and GA-g-CMCS was observed by SEM. As shown in Fig. 3C, GA was a rod-like crystalline compound. O-CMCS presented a sheet-like morphology, which possessed relatively smoother surfaces than GA. Notably, the morphology of O-CMCS was significantly changed by grafting GA. GA-g-CMCS showed several different shapes, such as round, sheet-like and rod-like morphology. In addition, the size of GA-g-CMCS particles was much smaller than that of O-CMCS. This suggested that O-CMCS underwent molecular degradation in the grafting process. Similar results were reported by Liu et al. [43], who found chitosan was serious degraded by Asc•− generated in Vc/H2O2 redox system."
12,In vitro antioxidant activity of GA-g-CMCS,"3.2 In vitro antioxidant activity of GA-g-CMCS 3.2.1 DPPH radical scavenging activity The DPPH radical scavenging activity of GA, O-CMCS and GA-g-CMCS is shown in Fig. 4A. Among all the samples tested, GA exhibited the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity, which rapidly increased to 91.42% at 0.5 mg/mL and kept almost constant afterwards. Some researchers also found the DPPH scavenging activity of GA showed a similar trend [17,44]. The DPPH scavenging activity of GA was associated with its hydrogen atom donating ability [6]. The DPPH radical scavenging activity of O-CMCS was much low (only 2.98% at 2.5 mg/mL). As compared with O-CMCS, GA-g-CMCS showed a significantly higher DPPH radical scavenging activity (55.58% at 2.5 mg/mL). The IC50 values for GA, O-CMCS and GA-g-CMCS were 0.27, 58.43 and 2.12 mg/mL, respectively. GA-g-CMCS could react with DPPH radical by donating hydrogen atom to form stable DPPH-H and GA-g-CMCS radical. Then, GA-g-CMCS radical could be further withdrawn hydrogen atom to form stable GA-g-CMCS quinone [45]. Above results indicated that the DPPH radical scavenging activity of GA-g-CMCS was mainly attributed to the function of gallate moieties. Similar enhancements in DPPH radical scavenging activity were also reported when GA was grafted onto chitosan, chitosan oligosaccharide, N,O-CMCS and inulin [12,15,33,40,42]. 3.2.2 Reducing power The reducing power of GA, O-CMCS and GA-g-CMCS is presented in Fig. 4B. The reducing power of samples decreased in the order of GA > GA-g-CMCS > O-CMCS. At 2.5 mg/mL, the reducing power of GA, O-CMCS and GA-g-CMCS reached 2.63, 0.07 and 1.07, respectively. The IC50 values for GA, O-CMCS and GA-g-CMCS were 0.10, 251.15 and 1.06 mg/mL, respectively. The potent reducing power of GA was attributed to its ability to reduce ferric iron (III) to ferrous iron (II) [35]. By contrast, the low reducing power of O-CMCS was mainly attributed to the amino group at C-2 position. Notably, the reducing power of O-CMCS was remarkably enhanced by grafting GA. Similar enhancements in reducing power were also found when GA was grafted onto chitosan and N,O-CMCS [33,35,40,42]."
13,Cytotoxicity of GA-g-CMCS on RAW264.7 cells,"3.3 Cytotoxicity of GA-g-CMCS on RAW264.7 cells In order to evaluate the cytotoxicity of GA-g-CMCS, RAW264.7 cells were treated with different concentrations (25–400 μg/mL) of GA-g-CMCS (Fig. 5A). As compared with normal control group, both GA-g-CMCS and O-CMCS showed no cytotoxic effects on RAW264.7 cells at the tested concentrations. The cell viability of the normal control group was set as 100%, and the relative cell viability of GA-g-CMCS and O-CMCS treatment groups were over 90%. Till now, many studies have demonstrated GA-g-polysaccharides have non-toxic effects on several normal cells. For instant, GA-g-chitosan is non-toxic to RAW264.7 mouse macrophage cells at 50–500 μg/mL [35,46], Chang liver cells at 100–500 μg/mL [47], and PC12 cells at 0–200 μg/mL [48]. In addition, GA-g-chitosan oligosaccharide shows no cytotoxicity on human chondrosarcoma SW1353 cells at 10–100 μg/mL [49], RAW264.7 mouse macrophage cells at 10–100 μg/mL [50] and RBL-2H3 mast cells at 50–200 μg/mL [19]. Our study further demonstrated GA-g-CMCS was non-toxic to RAW264.7 cells at 25–400 μg/mL."
14,Protective effect of GA-g-CMCS against H2O2-induced oxidative damage in RAW264.7 cells,"3.4 Protective effect of GA-g-CMCS against H2O2-induced oxidative damage in RAW264.7 cells 3.4.1 Effect of GA-g-CMCS on the cell viability of RAW264.7 cells H2O2 can diffuse readily across cellular membranes of macrophage cells and is converted into highly toxic and reactive hydroxyl radical via Fenton reaction. The formed hydroxyl radical can cause cell death through lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and DNA damage [51]. In this study, the cytotoxicity of H2O2 was assessed by exposing RAW264.7 cells to various concentrations of H2O2 (0.2–2.0 mmol/L). As shown in Fig. 5B, cell viability gradually decreased as the concentration of H2O2 increased. The cell viability was 56.12% upon exposure to 1.4 mmol/L of H2O2 for 2 h. In general, the cytotoxicity of H2O2 depends on the type and density of the cells as well as the concentration and treatment time of H2O2 [52]. In this study, 1.4 mmol/L of H2O2 was selected to cause oxidative injury in RAW264.7 cells in subsequent assays. Effect of GA-g-CMCS on the cell viability in H2O2-treated RAW264.7 cells was represented in Fig. 5C. As compared with H2O2 treatment alone, the pretreatment with 100–400 μg/mL of GA-g-CMCS significantly increased the cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. However, the pretreatment with 25–400 μg/mL of O-CMCS did not significantly change the cell viability of H2O2-treated RAW264.7 cells. These results indicated that the grafting of GA could remarkably enhance the protective effect of O-CMCS against H2O2-induced cell death. Senevirathne et al. [47] found that pre-treatment with GA-g-chitosan (100, 250 and 500 μg/mL) could elevate the viability of tert-butyl hydroperoxide-treated Chang liver cells dose-dependently. Our results showed that 100, 200 and 400 μg/mL of GA-g-CMCS pretreatment could effectively protect RAW264.7 cells against H2O2-induced cytotoxicity. Therefore, the protective mechanisms of GA-g-CMCS (100, 200 and 400μg/mL) against H2O2-induced oxidative damage were further evaluated in subsequent experiments. 3.4.2 Effect of GA-g-CMCS on the apoptosis of RAW264.7 cells The apoptotic rate of RAW264.7 cells was detected by flow cytometry using the Annexin V-FITC/PI double labeling method. Annexin V has a strong Ca2+-dependent affinity to phospholipid phosphatidylserine, which occurs in the early stage of apoptosis. PI reflects the damage of cell membrane, which occurs either in the late stage of apoptosis or in dead cells. Therefore, the early apoptotic cells were identified as Annexin V-FITC+ and PI−. The nonviable cells (the late apoptotic cells or necrotic cells) were identified as Annexin V-FITC+ and PI+, and viable cells were identified as Annexin V-FITC− and PI− [53]. As shown in Fig. 6 , the percentage of nonviable cells increased to 39.4% after H2O2 treatment alone, suggesting H2O2 could cause oxidative damage in cells and lead to apoptosis. Notably, the pretreatment with 100, 200 and 400 μg/mL of GA-g-CMCS prior to H2O2 exposure significantly reduced the percentage of nonviable cells to 31.1%, 28.1% and 20.8%, respectively. In addition, the percentage of nonviable cells in GA-g-CMCS treatment groups decreased with the increase of sample concentration. Nonetheless, the pretreatment of the cells with O-CMCS prior to H2O2 exposure only slightly decreased the percentage of nonviable cells (36.8–37.5%). These results indicated the grafting of GA could significantly increase the protective effect of O-CMCS against H2O2-induced late apoptosis or necrosis in RAW264.7 cells. 3.4.3 Effect of GA-g-CMCS on the membrane integrity of RAW264.7 cells H2O2-treatment can break down the integrity of cell membrane, leading to the leakage of LDH into the culture medium. Therefore, the protective effect of GA-g-CMCS on H2O2-induced cell death can be confirmed by LDH release assay. As shown in Fig. 7A, RAW264.7 cells treated with H2O2 alone could induce the release of LDH into the culture medium, causing 2.1-fold increase compared with that of normal control group. A similar result was reported by Wen et al. [39], who observed the LDH release significantly increased after RAW264.7 cells were exposed to 0.5 mmol/L of H2O2 for 12 h. Notably, the pretreatment of the cells with GA-g-CMCS prior to H2O2 exposure remarkably attenuated H2O2-induced LDH release in a dose-dependent manner. However, the pretreatment with O-CMCS prior to H2O2 exposure had no effect on the relief of H2O2-induced LDH release. Liu et al. [54] found the pre-treatment with chitosan oligosaccharide (50, 100 and 200 μg/mL) for 24 h could attenuate H2O2-induced LDH release. Above results suggested GA-g-CMCS could effectively protect H2O2-induced oxidative injury by maintaining the membrane integrity of RAW264.7 cells. 3.4.4 Effect of GA-g-CMCS on the intracellular ROS production in RAW264.7 cells The intracellular ROS levels were determined based on DCFH-DA fluorescence. DCFH-DA can pass through the cell membrane freely and can be hydrolyzed by intracellular esterase to form DCFH. DCFH cannot penetrate cell membrane and intracellular ROS can oxidize non-fluorescent DCFH to fluorescent DCF. Therefore, the intracellular ROS level can be measured by detecting the fluorescence of DCF [35]. As shown in Fig. 7B, the intracellular ROS level of RAW264.7 cells treated with H2O2 alone was almost 3-fold increase compared with that of normal control group. Similar results were also reported by many other researchers in H2O2-treated RAW264.7 cells [38,39,55]. The pretreatment with O-CMCS prior to H2O2 exposure did not significantly reduce the intracellular ROS level in RAW264.7 cells. However, the pretreatment with GA-g-CMCS prior to H2O2 exposure had a dose-dependent effect on reducing intracellular ROS production. Above results suggested the cytoprotective effect of GA-g-CMCS might be related to the inhibition of intracellular ROS formation. Some researchers also found that GA-g-chitosan and GA-g-chitosan oligosaccharide could inhibit intracellular ROS production in RAW264.7 cells [12,35,50,56]. 3.4.5 Effect of GA-g-CMCS on the intracellular antioxidant enzyme activity in RAW264.7 cells Overproduction of ROS is a leading cause of oxidative damage and cell apoptosis. Cells are often equipped with several enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants for the prevention of ROS-induced damage [54]. SOD, CAT and GSH-Px are the major antioxidant enzymes, which play a key role in the interception and degradation of superoxide anion and H2O2 [55]. Therefore, the metabolism level of intracellular ROS can be reflected by the activity of antioxidant enzymes. As compared with normal control group, the treatment of RAW264.7 cells with H2O2 alone reduced the activity of SOD, CAT and GSH-Px by 57.71%, 20.67% and 38.57%, respectively (Fig. 8 ). This indicated the intracellular antioxidant defense systems of RAW264.7 cells were disrupted by H2O2 treatment. However, the pretreatment with GA-g-CMCS prior to H2O2 exposure dose-dependently attenuated the decrease of antioxidant enzyme activity caused by H2O2. As compared with normal control group, the pretreatment with 400 μg/mL of GA-g-CMCS prior to H2O2 exposure restored 78.57%, 94.92% and 100.71% of SOD, CAT and GSH-Px activity, respectively. The pretreatment with O-CMCS prior to H2O2 exposure did not remarkably impair intracellular antioxidant enzyme activity. Cho et al. [56] found GA-g-chitosan could up-regulate the protein expression of antioxidant enzymes including SOD and glutathione reductase under H2O2-mediated oxidative stress in RAW264.7 cells. Similar results were reported when H2O2-treated RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with GA-g-chitosan oligosaccharide [50]. Senevirathne et al. [47] reported GA-g-chitosan could restore the activity of SOD, CAT and GSH-Px in Chang liver cells treated with tert-butyl hydroperoxide. 3.4.6 Effect of GA-g-CMCS on the intracellular MDA level in RAW264.7 cells Lipid peroxidation is one of the primary events in free radical-mediated cell injury. MDA, the major secondary metabolite of lipid peroxidation, is widely used as a biomarker of oxidative stress. Therefore, intracellular MDA content serves as an indicator of the extent of lipid peroxidation and an indirect reflection of the extent of cell damage [39]. As shown in Fig. 8D, the intracellular MDA content in H2O2-treated RAW264.7 cells was significantly higher than that of normal control group. The elevation of MDA production was associated with LDH release, indicating the membrane integrity of the cells was disrupted by H2O2-treatment. The pretreatment with GA-g-CMCS prior to H2O2 exposure significantly reduced intracellular MDA content in a dose-dependent manner. However, the pretreatment with O-CMCS had no effect on the intracellular MDA level. Senevirathne et al. [47] evaluated the lipid peroxidation inhibitory effect of GA-g-chitosan by diphenyl-1-pyrenylphosphine-based assay, and found the conjugate significantly inhibited tert-butyl hydroperoxide-induced lipid peroxidation in Chang liver cells. Ngo et al. [49] found GA-g-chitosan oligosaccharide could dose-dependently inhibit H2O2-induced membrane lipid peroxidation in human chondrosarcoma SW1353 cells. Our results indicated the inhibition of lipid peroxidation might be involved in the protective effect of GA-g-CMCS on H2O2-treated RAW264.7 cells. Overproduction of ROS can induce oxidative stress and damage to the structural biomacromolecules of cells, such as DNA, proteins and lipids. Normally, polysaccharides cannot penetrate cell membrane. However, polysaccharides can react with some signaling molecules on the cell membrane to become activated, and thus possess bioactivity without penetrating into the cells [57]. In this study, the cell viability and intra-cellular antioxidant potential of H2O2-treated RAW264.7 cells were greatly enhanced by the pretreatment of GA-g-CMCS. Meanwhile, the pretreatment of GA-g-CMCS significantly reduced the oxidative damage degree of cell membrane, the intracellular ROS level and apoptosis ratio of H2O2-treated RAW264.7 cells. Above results suggested that GA-g-CMCS could protect RAW264.7 cells against H2O2-induced oxidative stress."
15,Conclusions,"GA was successfully grafted onto O-CMCS by a free radical-mediated reaction. In the grafting process, the amino group of O-CMCS and the carboxyl group of GA were covalently linked through amide bond. The grafting of GA significantly improved the antioxidant activity of O-CMCS. Based on the results of antioxidant in vitro and cellular assays, the protective mechanisms of GA-g-CMCS against H2O2-induced oxidative damage in RAW264.7 cells were proposed. GA-g-CMCS could not penetrate cell membrane due to its large molecular weight but it could directly scavenge extracellular H2O2, thereby reducing the content of H2O2 entering into the cells. Meanwhile, GA-g-CMCS could reduce the oxidative damage degree of cell membrane. In addition, GA-g-CMCS might activate the signaling molecules on the cell membrane and trigger intracellular antioxidant defense systems (e.g. antioxidant enzymes) to attenuate ROS-induced oxidative injury. In the future, deeper antioxidant mechanisms of GA-g-CMCS can be further revealed by signaling pathway analysis and animal experiments."
