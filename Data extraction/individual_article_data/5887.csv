0,Introduction,"Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) are a class of oxidoreductase enzymes that catalyse the reversible conversion of aldehydes or ketones to alcohols in the presence of NAD(P)H cofactors. Regeneration of the cofactor is a crucial parameter in deciding the economics of the process for commercial application. Recycling of cofactor is usually achieved by either coupling the reaction with a substrate like 2-propanol or enzymes such as glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) or formate dehydrogenase (FDH) (Ernst et al., 2005; Hummel, 1990; Weckbecker and Hummel, 2005; Zhao and van der Donk, 2003). However, these processes require stoichiometric amounts of additional substrates and hence produce unnecessary by-products such as gluconolactone, acetone or CO2 (Köninger et al., 2016). While isopropanol, typically employed in the substrate coupled cofactor recycle, is a cheaper co-substrate, the reaction is majorly limited by equilibrium constraints thus necessitating its use in excess to drive the reaction to completion (Hummel, 1990). The ADH from Lactobacillus kefir (LkADH) is employed for industrial application in the conversion of acetophenone derivatives to chiral alcohols utilizing NADPH as the cofactor (Bradshaw et al., 1992; Weckbecker and Hummel, 2006). A GDH-mediated system is usually used for NADPH regeneration in LkADH-catalysed ketone reduction, but it suffers from poor atom economy. Such issues necessitate the development of an improved system for cofactor regeneration. Cyanobacteria are photoautotrophs capable of harvesting light energy and sequestering CO2, thereby maintaining the redox balance in the cell by recycling NADPH and ATP, via the photosystem (PS) and Calvin cycle (Alagesan et al., 2016, 2013; Hendry et al., 2016; Yamanaka et al., 2011). This light driven synthesis of NADPH has been demonstrated as an efficient system for cofactor recycling during biotransformation using both native and recombinant cyanobacteria (Köninger et al., 2016; Nakamura et al., 2000; Nakamura and Yamanaka, 2002a).While the effect of CO2 in modulating product enantioselectivity has been observed in the conversion of acetophenone in cultures of Nicotiana tabacum, it did not affect the conversion efficiency (Kojima et al., 2009). Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 is a model strain of cyanobacteria that is widely used for metabolic engineering because of its ease of gene manipulation and chromosomal segregation (Ma et al., 2014). Although the wild type S. elongatus has been reported to exhibit ketoreductase activity on acetophenone derivatives, it showed low biotransformation efficiency and the reaction was restricted to low substrate concentrations of less than 1 mM (Nakamura and Yamanaka, 2002a, 2002b; Yamanaka et al., 2011). In a recent study, a heterologously expressed enoate reductase in a model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was able to effect significant C = C reduction albeit at relatively high cell densities (Köninger et al., 2016). Therefore, the present study was undertaken to (i) test the efficiency of a recombinant cyanobacteria for LkADH-mediated stereoselective bioreduction of acetophenone to 1-phenylethanol and (ii) study the effect of light and CO2 levels on the efficiency of biotransformation."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Cloning of adh gene,"2.1 Cloning of adh gene The adh gene from L. kefir (UniProt ID Q6WVP7) codon optimized for expression in E. coli and cyanobacteria was synthesized from BioInnovations, Invitrogen™. The gene was amplified using specific primers adhF and R (Table S1) and cloned in the pSyn6 vector (Invitrogen™, USA) between NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. The adh gene was expressed under the control of cyanobacterial promoter psbAI, a 200bp DNA element from S. elongatus, in pSyn6. This recombinant vector can replicate as a plasmid in E. coli (TOP10 cells); when transformed in cyanobacteria, the heterologous gene along with the spectinomycin cassette gets integrated into the neutral site (NS1) of the chromosome."
3,Transformation and segregation in cyanobacteria,"2.2 Transformation and segregation in cyanobacteria Cells from 1.5 ml of 0.8 optical density (OD730nm) S. elongatus culture were resuspended in 100 μl BG-11 medium (Allen, 1968). The recombinant plasmid DNA (2–5 μg) was added to the cell suspension and incubated in dark for 4 h at 34 °C. The mixture was then inoculated in 20 ml BG-11 medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml spectinomycin and incubated at 30 °C under 150 μE light and ambient CO2. Segregation of the construct was performed by passaging the culture multiple times and sequentially increasing spectinomycin concentration to 100 μg/ml. Then the culture was spread on BG-11 agar plates supplemented with 100 μg/ml spectinomycin to isolate the transformed and completely segregated colonies. Segregation was confirmed using the set of specific locus primers LF and R (Table S1)."
4,Microbial cultivation,"2.3 Microbial cultivation E. coli TOP10 strain containing the pSyn6 vector was grown in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml spectinomycin at 37 °C and 180 rpm. S. elongatus was cultivated in 50 ml BG-11 media at 30 °C under different light intensities and CO2 concentrations (as per the experimental requirement) in shaker incubator (Kuhner AG, LT-X, Switzerland) shaken at 120 rpm or in a Multi-Cultivator (Photon Systems Instrument, MC 1000-OD, Czech Republic) with CO2 bubbling with a flow rate of 100 sccm (standard cubic centimeter per minute) per tube with culture volume of 60 ml. The seed culture was grown in the presence of 100 μg/ml spectinomycin to ensure the stability of the construct. However, the biotransformation experiments were performed without the antibiotic pressure."
5,Determination of dry cell weight (DCW),2.4 Determination of dry cell weight (DCW) The cyanobacterial cells were harvested from 20 ml culture and dried at 85 °C to determine the dry weight. A pellet corresponding to an OD730nm of 3 was equivalent to 0.66 g/l DCW.
6,PsbA1 promoter activity,"2.5 PsbA1 promoter activity Recombinant S. elongatus strain was developed expressing the reporter enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) in pSyn6 vector under the control of psbAI promoter. The construct was integrated into the genome of S. elongatus at the NSI site and the integration was confirmed using primers LF and LR (Table S1). The S. elongatus cells were grown under different conditions of light and CO2 in Multi-Cultivator. Harvested cells were lysed by sonication, and fluorescence of the lysate was measured using a plate reader (TECAN infinite® M200 PRO, Austria, Europe) with λex = 500 nm and λem = 530 nm (Markley et al., 2015) to evaluate the promoter activity."
7,Whole cell biotransformation,"2.6 Whole cell biotransformation Whole cell biotransformation was performed using the recombinant S. elongatus psbAI_adh. The strain was grown in 50 ml BG-11 medium at 30 °C till OD730 =2 (0.44 g/l DCW), 3 (0.66 g/L) and 5 (1.1 g/L) under 0.5% CO2 in shaking chamber (Kuhner AG, LT-X, Switzerland) to optimize cell loading for the conversion of 20 mM acetophenone. 2.6.1 Effect of light and CO2 during bioconversion The recombinant S. elongatus psbAI_adh and wild type (WT) strains were grown in BG-11 at 30 °C under different light intensity and concentrations of CO2, and harvested cells were used for reduction of acetophenone. The conditions for growth and biotransformation are listed in Table S2. 2.6.2 Growing vs resting cells for biotransformation S. elongatus psbAI_adh and WT were grown at 30 °C in BG-11 medium pH 7.4 under 150 μE light intensity with bubbled 1% CO2 to an OD of 3 (0.66 g/L); harvested cells were transferred to either (i) fresh BG-11 medium or (ii) sodium phosphate buffer (resting condition) under different conditions. 20 mM acetophenone was added to the culture and samples were collected at different intervals over a period of 24 h. The product 1-phenylethanol was extracted and analyzed in GC-FID to determine yield and enantiomeric purity."
8,Quantification by GC-FID,"2.7 Quantification by GC-FID The product 1-phenylethanol was extracted from 500 μl samples by the addition of equal volume of ethyl acetate. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and analysed via Gas Chromatography fitted with flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID, TRACE GC ULTRA, Thermo Fischer, Massachusetts, USA) using a capillary 1&W CP CHIRASILDEX® CB GC column (Agilent), having a dimension of 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 μm (Shah et al., 2018). The carrier gas used was helium and nitrogen was used as the make-up gas. Air and hydrogen were used for the flame. The temperature of the column was maintained at 120 °C for 1 min, then raised at 30 °C/min to 150 °C and held for 6 min. Then again raised to a final temperature of 180 °C (60 °C/min) and held for 2 min. The retention times of acetophenone and (R)-1-phenylethanol were 2.67 and 3.23 min, respectively (Fig. S4)."
9,Results and discussion,"Chiral phenylethanols produced by the biocatalytic reduction of acetophenone derivatives are useful and important precursors for several pharmaceuticals and other fine chemicals (Głąb et al., 2016). The reduction process employing E. coli is often restricted by equilibrium constraints, and requires the use of excess co-substrate and simultaneous removal of by-product from the medium (Jakoblinnert et al., 2011). Alternately, cofactor recycling is achieved via a coupled enzyme such as GDH or FDH that catalyzes an irreversible reaction thereby driving the desired bioconversion to near completion (Li et al., 2015; Weckbecker and Hummel, 2004). The potential of cyanobacterial photosynthesis in recycling NADPH cofactors for oxidoreductase mediated bioreduction has been recently exploited using recombinant Synechocystis sp. (Köninger et al., 2016; Nakamura et al., 2000). The cyanobacterium S. elongatus has certain favourable characteristics as a host strain for applications in biotransformation, including (i) higher growth rate and tolerance towards high light (Fig. 1 a) than Synechocystis sp. employed by Köninger et al., (2016) and (ii) no requirement of additional supplements like vitamins for growth. Hence we intended to explore the potential of S. elongatus as a cyanobacterial host for the alcohol dehydrogenase-mediated reduction of acetophenone. Although the wild type S. elongatus has been reported to possess a native ADH enzyme, it did not exhibit any activity on acetophenone (Nakamura and Yamanaka, 2002b). We therefore constructed a recombinant S. elongatus strain expressing the heterologous LkADH enzyme under the psbA1 promoter (psbA1_adh strain). The psbAI promoter (P psbAI ) drives the expression of isoform I of D1 protein of photosystem II in cyanobacteria, and exhibits high activity under low to moderate light intensity (Kulkarni and Golden, 1994). The gene was cloned in the pSyn6 vector and amplified and maintained in E. coli. The plasmid was isolated and used to integrate the psbAI_adh construct along with the spectinomycin resistance cassette into the S. elongatus genome via homologous recombination at the chromosomal neutral site (NS1) and segregated to obtain a homogeneous population. Note that cyanobacteria exhibit polyploidy and hence chromosomal segregation was an essential step. No growth defect was observed in the recombinant cyanobacterial strain (data not shown). The recombinant S. elongatus strain expressing LkADH was cultured under increasing CO2 concentrations and light intensities to test their effect on growth and biotransformation. Bubbling CO2-mixed air through the culture in a multi-cultivator was employed to maintain a carbon sufficient state, where the growth of the cyanobacteria is not limited by the carbon availability. The carbon status could be evaluated by determining the reduction in expression levels of RubisCo enzyme, measured indirectly using an eYFP reporter protein expressed under the control of the rbcL promoter (P rbcL ). Repression of the rbcL promoter activity by 20% under high (1% aerated) CO2 environment compared to atmospheric CO2 has been reported earlier in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 (Onizuka et al., 2002). We observed that a carbon sufficient state in S. elongatus psbA1_adh was maintained even with 0.04% CO2 bubbled through the culture, with no significant variation in P rbcL activity upon increasing CO2 concentration (Fig. 1). The recombinant strain was therefore also cultured on shake flasks in the presence of 0.04% CO2 to emulate a truly carbon-limited environment for comparison. The recombinant S. elongatus psbAI_adh exhibited a 43% and 52% increase in growth rate when the CO2 concentration was increased from 0.04% (carbon limiting state in shake flask) to 0.5% and 1% (maintained by bubbling CO2-mixed air) respectively (Fig. 2 a). The combination of high light intensity (400 μE) and elevated CO2concentration (1%) resulted in a doubling of growth rate compared to ambient state to 0.06 h−1(Fig. 2a). Growth on 1% CO2 exhibited an extended pseudo-exponential phase (Fig. 2b), characterized by a slightly lower growth rate than the actual log phase but a steady increase in biomass (Ungerer et al., 2018). On studying the expression of a reporter protein (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein, EYFP) driven by the P psbAI , we observed that increase in CO2 concentration also enhanced the promoter activity (Fig. S2), indicating an increase in enzyme production coupled to enhanced cyanobacterial growth. To test the potential of S. elongatus as host in oxidoreductase-mediated biocatalysis, the whole cell biotransformation of 20 mM acetophenone using psbAI_adh cells was evaluated under different combinations of light intensity and CO2concentration. The importance of biotransformation medium was also studied where the cells were incubated either in fresh BG-11 medium (growing) or sodium phosphate buffer (resting) for 24 h. The conversion using LkADH in psbAI_adh cells was highly enantioselective, producing (R)-1-phenylethanol with 99% ee (Figs. S4 and S5). The wild type S. elongatus employed as a control showed no detectable conversion under the conditions employed (Fig. 3 a). In addition to the role of CO2 in enhancing cyanobacterial growth and enzyme production, an increased CO2 availability appeared to play a significant role in bioconversion as well. When ambient CO2 was employed for growth and biotransformation with 150 μE light intensity, acetophenone reduction using psbAI_adh cells resuspended in fresh medium proceeded only up to 27% (Fig. 3a). However, the use of CO2 adapted cells combined with the use of elevated CO2 concentration during biotransformation significantly enhanced the rate of conversion. A cell loading of 1.1 g/l under 0.5% CO2 was required to enhance the rate of conversion and drive the reaction to completion in 12 h (Fig. 3b). In fact, even with a lower cell loading of 0.66 g/l, complete conversion of 20 mM acetophenone could be achieved within 20 h using 0.5% CO2 and in 6 h with 1% CO2. The initial rate of bioconversion as determined by GC-FID increased significantly when CO2 concentration used for the reaction was increased from 0.5% to 1% (Fig. 3). The initial rate using 0.66 g/l under 1% CO2 was similar to 1.1 g/l under 0.5% CO2 (Fig. 1b). Importantly, cells grown under 1% CO2 still needed to be incubated under elevated CO2 levels during biotransformation in order to achieve efficient bioconversion. When ambient CO2 was employed for the biocatalytic reduction process with 1% CO2 grown cells, the conversion proceeded at a lower rate and saturated at 59% after 24 h (Fig. 3a). The enhanced efficiency of bioreduction in the presence of elevated CO2 could be partially attributed to increased cyanobacterial growth, consequently enhancing enzyme production as demonstrated by increased reporter (eYFP) fluorescence (Fig. S2) under high CO2 conditions. Higher CO2 concentration also enhances the availability and recycling of NADPH cofactor by virtue of higher metabolic activity. An earlier report has demonstrated a direct correlation between the yield of CO2 capture and the quantum efficiency of electron transport by photosystem I (PSI) and PSII (Harbinson et al., 1990). In photoautotrophs, NADPH formed in the photosystem is generally consumed in Calvin Cycle regenerating NADP+, maintaining the redox balance. The addition of chemical inhibitors of Calvin Cycle enzymes like RuBisCo and Ribulose 5-phosphate kinase has been reported to increase the reduction efficiency of acetophenone derivativesby the wild type S. elongatus (Yamanaka et al., 2011). We suggest that the probable suppression of competing pathways for NADPH utilization under the fast growing conditions, and the extended duration of exponential growth leading to increased PS activity (Harbinson et al., 1990), could shape better cofactor availability, thereby resulting in enhanced conversion efficiency under high CO2 levels. Since cofactor recycling is light dependent (Nakamura and Yamanaka, 2002a), we hypothesized that high light intensity might help in increasing the conversion rate even further. In Synechocystis sp. high light has been reported to reduce cell viability for biotransformation (Köninger et al., 2016). In this study, the cell viability of psbAI_adh was not compromised at 400 μE as it showed higher growth rate than at 150 μE (Fig. 2a). Nevertheless, the efficiency of acetophenone reduction was comparable under both 400 and 150 μE when supplemented with 1% CO2 (Fig. 3b) whereas under carbon limited state the bioconversion did not reach completion within 24 h. This indicated that the optimal light and CO2-aided cofactor recycling facilitated the reaction to reach its threshold and thus no further improvement was observed in conversion rate when light intensity was further increased under elevated CO2. The results from the study also suggest that bio-reduction with growing cells is advantageous over the use of resting cells (Fig. 4 ), probably due to the fact that the cofactor recycling process would require continued metabolic activity. Resting cells are associated with a non-growth status which either reduces the intracellular active enzyme pools or limits the cofactor pool in the cell (Walton and Stewart, 2004), consequently reducing the rate of conversion of the substrate as also observed in this study (Fig. 4). The use of resting cells incubated even under elevated CO2 levels did not show any improvement in conversion; rather, the overexposure to light and CO2 only led to bleaching due to longer incubation in the absence of other nutrients including nitrate or sulphate (Richaud et al., 2001) (data not shown). On the other hand, photosynthetic biotransformation in growing cells aided by enhanced CO2 availability enabled complete reduction of 20 mM acetophenone in 6 h using a relatively low cell loading of 0.66 g/l. The Synechocystis sp. expressing enoate reductase required a cell loading of 1.8 g/l for complete conversion of the enoate substrates under growing condition (Köninger et al., 2016). Although E. coli has been widely used as host for oxidoreductase-mediated biocatalysis, acetophenone reduction using recombinant E. coli whole cells even in the presence of cofactor recycling enzymes like FDH saturates at 66–85% (Li et al., 2015; Weckbecker and Hummel, 2004). In contrast, recombinant S. elongatus was able to completely convert the substrate with minimum cell density under optimised light and CO2 (Fig. 3b) with a high conversion rate of 3.1 mM h−1(Fig. S3), regenerating NADPH via photosynthesis. The acetophenone concentration generally used in whole cell biotransformation studies is around 20 mM and no substrate or product inhibition was reported to this limit (Köninger et al., 2016; Li et al., 2015; Zhaoxing et al., 2003). However, concentration of 50 mM acetophenone and above showed no conversion with psbAI_adh, probably due to cellular toxicity of the substrate at this concentration as also observed in other organisms (Zhaoxing et al., 2003). In conclusion, this study demonstrates the use of engineered photosynthetic cyanobacteria as a host for more efficient whole cell oxidoreductase mediated biotransformation over previous reports (Table 1 ). S. elongatus cells expressing heterologous ADH from L. kefir were employed for the fermentative reduction 20 mM acetophenone to (R)-1-phenylethanolunder optimized conditions of light and CO2. The enhanced carbon availability to the cell during growth and biotransformation improved the cofactor recycling, thus enabling faster conversion at lower cell loading compared to earlier studies (Köninger et al., 2016) that employed Synechocystis sp. biocatalyst. Although cellular toxicity of higher concentrations of substrates might be a prominent limitation in such a process, the efficiency of the process could be improved via the use of strain engineering (Zhou et al., 2015; Luo et al., 2018) and adaptive evolution (Wang et al., 2014) to make it economically viable."
