0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is an important feedstock for various applications such as fuel cell, hydrotreating, hydrogenation, and production of ammonia or methanol [1]. One of the promising hydrogen utilization is to apply to fuel cell for mainly generating electricity and heat. There are several types of fuel cells that are commonly used, including polymeric electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC), and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). However, the hydrogen supplied to low temperature fuel cell such as PEMFC is typically limited under condition of high purity of hydrogen with considerably low concentration of carbon monoxide (CO). Its acceptable value that the active sites on the anode of PEMFC can be tolerable and unharmed from poisonous gaseous CO is around 10–50ppm [2]. On the other hand, CO can be performed as another fuel source in high-temperature fuel cell i.e. MCFC and SOFC. Numerous alternative methods to produce hydrogen have been carried out such as steam reforming, partial oxidation, autothermal reforming, coal gasification, electrolysis, or decomposition [3]. Among these methods, steam reforming is a conventional process that is carried out in a number of industries due to high capability of hydrogen production and energy efficiency [3]. However, it has been revealed that the steam reforming process generates larger amount of greenhouse gas such as CO2 compared to other processes [4]. According to the environmental concern, the decomposition of hydrocarbon has been recently attracted a great attention used to produce hydrogen as it gives pure hydrogen without any COx exhausts and yields valuable and marketable by-product, carbon, in different forms, such as carbon nanofiber (CNF) [5–7] or carbon nanotube (CNT) [8–10], depending on the type of catalyst used in the reaction. The CNF and CNT have been widely used in electronic applications, gas storage materials, composite materials, and catalyst supports [11–15], etc. More importantly, carbon capture by means of decomposition process is certainly beneficial to surroundings as a result of ability to suppress the CO2 emission to atmosphere. The comparison between the decomposition and steam reforming processes has been proposed by several researchers [16–19]. In case of using methane as a fuel, it was obviously found that the decomposition requires significantly lower energy input per mole of hydrogen produced (37.8kJmol−1 H2), compared to the steam reforming (63.3kJmol−1 H2). In addition, the amount of CO2 emission of the latter was greatly higher than that of the former (0.43 and 0.05molCO2 mol−1 H2) [18]. As reported by Steinberg [16], it was revealed that the decomposition of methane is more effective than the steam reforming especially in term of the easiness of separating the stable solid carbon from the decomposition process compared to sequestering CO2 produced as a reactive gas or low temperature liquid from the steam reforming. Among hydrogen production from thermal and autocatalytic decomposition of methane and the steam reforming with and without CO2 capture and storage, the autocatalytic decomposition exhibited the lowest total environmental impact and CO2 emissions. Although lower CO2 emissions could be achieved by the steam reforming with CO2 capture and storage, its total environmental impact was higher than the conventional one [17]. At the present, hydrocarbons, such as methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), ethylene (C2H4), propane (C3H8), butane (C4H10) and alcohols, including methanol (CH3OH), ethanol (C2H5OH) and glycerol (C3H8O3), have been generally employed in steam reforming processes as primary fuels [20–24]. All these fuels give hydrogen-containing products which are typically supplied as a fuel in MCFC or SOFC. However, it could be supplied to PEMFC after reducing the CO concentration via the secondary reactors i.e. water-gas shift or preferential oxidation units. To our knowledge, even though the heat management in the decomposition and the steam reforming has been performed [16,23,24], the study of those systems under thermally self-sustained condition is still limited. The purpose of this project is therefore addressed on examining suitable operating mode and operating condition under energy self-sustained condition system for various primary fuels. We will focus on the decomposition process as this process gives high hydrogen purity and is environmental friendly. The suitable condition will be determined in terms of hydrogen production, hydrogen purity, CO fraction, and carbon yield, and will be further compared with the conventional process, steam reforming. Finally, the suitable process of hydrogen production for different fuel cell grades will be discussed."
1,Modelling and simulation methodology,"As mention earlier, hydrogen can be produced from various types of primary fuels, such as light hydrocarbons (C1–C3) and alcohols. A number of possible reactions would take place in both decomposition and steam reforming processes. However, main reactions can be summarized as follows: Decomposition: (1) Methane cracking: CH 4 ⇌ C ( s ) + 2 H 2 Δ H 0 = 74.9 kJ mol − 1 (2) Ethane cracking: C 2 H 6 ⇌ 2 C ( s ) + 3 H 2 Δ H 0 = 83.9 kJ mol − 1 (3) Propane cracking: C 3 H 8 ⇌ 3 C ( s ) + 4 H 2 Δ H 0 = 104.7 kJ mol − 1 (4) Methanol decomposition: CH 3 OH ⇌ CO + 2 H 2 Δ H 0 = 90.5 kJ mol − 1 (5) Ethanol decomposed to CO: C 2 H 5 OH ⇌ CO + CH 4 + H 2 Δ H 0 = 49.9 kJ mol − 1 (6) Ethanol decomposed to CO 2 : C 2 H 5 OH ⇌ 1 2 CO 2 + 3 2 CH 4 Δ H 0 = − 73.8 kJ mol − 1 (7) Glycerol decomposition: C 3 H 8 O 3 ⇌ 3 CO + 4 H 2 Δ H 0 = 246.3 kJ mol − 1 Steam reforming: (8) Methane steam reforming ( MSR ) : CH 4 + H 2 O ⇌ CO + 3 H 2 Δ H 0 = 206.2 kJ mol − 1 (9) Methane steam reforming ( overall ) : CH 4 + 2 H 2 O ⇌ CO 2 + 4 H 2 Δ H 0 = 165.0 kJ mol − 1 (10) Ethane steam reforming ( overall ) : C 2 H 6 + 4 H 2 O ⇌ 2 CO 2 + 7 H 2 Δ H 0 = 264.2 kJ mol − 1 (11) Propane steam reforming ( overall ) : C 3 H 8 + 6 H 2 O ⇌ 3 CO 2 + 10 H 2 Δ H 0 = 375.2 kJ mol − 1 (12) Methanol steam reforming ( overall ) : CH 3 OH + H 2 O ⇌ CO 2 + 3 H 2 Δ H 0 = 49.3 kJ mol − 1 (13) Ethanol steam reforming ( overall ) : C 2 H 5 OH + 3 H 2 O ⇌ 2 CO 2 + 6 H 2 Δ H 0 = 173.8 kJ mol − 1 (14) Glycerol steam reforming ( overall ) : C 3 H 8 O 3 + 3 H 2 O ⇌ 3 CO 2 + 7 H 2 Δ H 0 = 122.9 kJ mol − 1 As shown in the decomposition process, C1–C3 hydrocarbons can be converted to the desired gaseous hydrogen and solid carbon [Eqs. (1)–(3)], whereas alcohols typically decompose to exhausted gas such as CH4, CO and CO2 [Eqs. (5)–(7)], which can lead to more carbon formation according to the following reactions. (15) Boudouard reaction: 2 CO ⇌ C + CO 2 Δ H 0 = − 172.5 kJ mol − 1 (16) Reverse gasification of C to CO: CO + H 2 ⇌ H 2 O + C Δ H 0 = − 131.3 kJ mol − 1 (17) Reverse gasification of C to CO 2 : CO 2 + 2 H 2 ⇌ 2 H 2 O + C Δ H 0 = − 90.2 kJ mol − 1 In addition, side reactions as shown below would be taken into account when by-products appeared. (18) Water gas shift ( WGS ) : CO + H 2 O ⇌ CO 2 + H 2 Δ H 0 = − 41.2 kJ mol − 1 (19) Dry reforming ( DR ) : CH 4 + CO 2 ⇌ 2 CO + 2 H 2 Δ H 0 = 247.3 kJ mol − 1 In case of steam reforming process, CO and CO2 are major by-products which can be possibly involved in the reactions (15)–(19). The reaction performances for different fuel cells such as equilibrium conversion, selectivity of hydrogen and by-products, carbon yield, and hydrogen purity, are calculated by equations summarized in Table 1 . The direction of each reaction depends upon equilibrium constant (K eq), which is a function of reaction temperature. The equilibrium constants of the related reactions can be found in other publications [25–27]. As mentioned previously, the solid carbon can be certainly generated by the decomposition of hydrocarbon. The carbon activity (α C) has been widely used as the thermodynamic indicator of carbon formation as addressed in a number of the previous researches [25,28,29]. Nonetheless, its value merely predicts the carbon formation without providing the amount of carbon formed. For instance, the carbon activity of methane cracking can be expressed by the following equation: (20) α C , CH 4 = K 1 p CH 4 p H 2 2 where K 1 is the equilibrium constant of methane decomposition and p CH 4 and p H 2 is partial pressure of CH4 and H2, respectively. The criterion of carbon formation is considered at the carbon activity value equal to 1. The carbon formation is observed when carbon activity is more than 1 whereas the equilibrium state is occurred when carbon activity is equal to 1 and the carbon unfavorably forms when carbon activity is less than 1. However, some researchers [27,30–32] determined the carbon formation by means of Gibbs free energy minimization, which is a function that indicates the tendency of the reaction at equilibrium state. The Gibbs free energy minimization method is commonly utilized to determine the equilibrium composition at desired temperature and pressure. In this work, the calculation of the equilibrium values at different reaction temperatures is determined by Gibbs free energy minimization. The vapor–solid phases with Peng–Robinson Equation of State were used in this simulation. The solid carbon was assumed to be graphite in every reaction that generated the carbon. No reaction was necessary to state in the Gibbs free energy minimization module but the possible products converted from the related primary fuel and process have to be input in the calculation, which can be found elsewhere [20,31,33–35]. For both hydrocarbon cracking processes and the steam reforming of hydrocarbons yields H2, carbon, and low hydrocarbons but additional CO and CO2 can be obtained in the steam reforming processes as by-products. On the other hand, the use of methanol in both processes can reasonably gain dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3), formaldehyde (HCHO), CH4, H2, CO, CO2, H2O and carbon. In case of using ethanol as a fuel source, acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), acetone (CH3COCH3), diethyl ether (C2H5OC2H5), C2H6, C2H4, CH4, H2, CO, CO2, H2O and carbon would be produced. Further, the decomposition and steam reforming of glycerol can presumably produce acetaldehyde, acrolein (C3H4O), acetone, methanol, ethanol, acetic acid (CH3COOH), C3H6, C2H6, C2H4, CH4, H2, CO, CO2, H2O and carbon. Each reactant used in the decomposition and steam reforming was fed to their systems at 298K. Regardless of the steam reforming system, the appropriate mole of feeding water was calculated according to its stoichiometric coefficient of overall steam reforming reaction, which consequently gives the maximum mole of hydrogen produced. The reaction temperatures were studied in the range of 400–1600K at pressure of 1bar. In this paper, the decomposition and steam reforming of primary fuel i are denoted as D-i and SR-i, respectively. In addition, owing to the endothermic reaction of both systems, it requires the external heat source to operate these systems. However, the systems under thermally self-sustained condition should be carried out to be fair comparison of reaction performances between the decomposition and the steam reforming. To operate these systems under energy self-sustained condition as shown the system configurations in Fig. 1 , it could be achieved from the aid of the combustion of a portion of primary fuel [Fig. 1(a)] or product stream [Fig. 1(b)]. As considered these operations, a portion of primary fuel or product stream was introduced to a burner to generate heat (Q c) for supplying to the reactor until the heat requirement of reactor (Q r) is reached, resulting in zero net heat of the system (Q r + Q c). The complete combustion in the burner and the exhausted gases from the burner at exit temperature of 373K were assumed."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Effect of the operating temperature on the reaction performances,"3.1 Effect of the operating temperature on the reaction performances In this paper, reaction performances will be proposed in terms of the selectivity of the product, hydrogen, and of by-products, CH4, CO, and CO2, as a function of temperature for different primary fuels, processing by the decomposition and the steam reforming for comparison purposes. Starting with the equilibrium conversion for each primary fuel (data not shown), it was found that the equilibrium conversion of methane from either D-CH4 or SR-CH4 was increased with increasing reaction temperature. Since the methane cracking and the methane steam reforming are endothermic reactions, the increase in temperature resulted in enhancing the value of the equilibrium constant, leading to higher methane consumption and product generation. Therefore, the equilibrium methane conversion was subsequently lifted up until the value closed to 100% at ca. 1500K for D-CH4. It should be noted that the equilibrium conversion of methane shows the similar simulation results and is in good agreement with the results reported by Ogihara et al. [36]. Moreover, the equilibrium compositions from SR-CH4 of this work were also validated with those of Seo et al. [37]. It is worthy to note that although lower equilibrium constant of SR-CH4 was observed at low temperature comparing to D-CH4, higher equilibrium conversion was achieved. This is because of WGS, which could shift forward the main reaction of methane steam reforming and further enhanced the equilibrium conversion. At high temperature, higher in the equilibrium constant resulted in providing higher equilibrium conversion from SR-CH4. Therefore, not only the equilibrium constant, but also the occurrence of side reaction, WGS, could play an important role in obtaining high conversion when compared to D-CH4. On the other hand, other light hydrocarbons and alcohols were entirely consumed over temperature range of the studied and gave 100% conversion. Such complete conversion observed with light hydrocarbons and alcohols in either cracking or steam reforming systems. In Fig. 2(a) is shown percent selectivity of hydrogen at different temperatures. When the primary fuel was methane, it was observed as expected that D-CH4 and SR-CH4 give 100% selectivity of hydrogen regardless of temperature. This result is due to no other products containing H atom is formed for both systems. For other primary fuels, including light hydrocarbons and alcohols, at low temperature, low hydrogen selectivity was observed as methane was generated as a by-product. The hydrogen selectivity increased when temperature was raised due to the by-product, methane, reacted via methane cracking or methane steam reforming. It is noted that the hydrogen selectivity from the steam reforming of other hydrocarbon feeds is higher than those obtained from the decomposition process. It was reasonably suggested that the steam reforming accompanied with WGS can produce more hydrogen, whereas the decomposition generally obtains high solid carbon and consequently reduces the hydrogen production via the reverse methane cracking [reverse of reaction (1)]. It is also noted that, no significant difference in hydrogen selectivity of steam reforming was observed whereas those of the decomposition of light hydrocarbons were higher than alcohols. As seen in reactions (2) and (3), light hydrocarbon cracking typically generates hydrogen and solid carbon. The hydrogen produced could be further consumed in reverse methane cracking leading to less hydrogen remained. However, CO, CH4, CO2 and carbon, by-products, can be occurred in the decomposition of alcohol as shown in reactions (4)–(7). These by-products can be reacted with hydrogen by various side reactions such as reverse methane cracking, methanation [reverse of reaction (8)], and reverse gasification. As a result, hydrogen remained from decomposition of alcohol was less than those remained from decomposition of light hydrocarbon, leading to less hydrogen selectivity. In addition, D-C3H8O3 gave the lowest hydrogen selectivity among all systems studied. This phenomenon can be explained as glycerol could be thermally cracked into high ratio of CO/H2 [reaction (7)] comparing to ethanol and methanol. This high CO/H2 ratio can enhance either methanation by reverse of reaction (8) or reverse gasification of C to CO [reaction (16)], leading to high water content. For the by-products selectivity, based on C atom balance, the possible by-products such as CH4, CO, CO2, and solid carbon were taken into account. The methane selectivity [Fig. 2(b)] was high at low temperature and gradually decreased until approaching to zero at temperature approximately 1500K. By considering the equilibrium constant, methane is easily formed at low temperature by reverse methane cracking or methanation and is decomposed or reformed with steam at higher temperature. In Fig. 2(c) is present the selectivity of CO as a function of temperature. It was observed that CO selectivity increased when temperature was elevated. At low temperature, CO could be entirely consumed via the related reactions, including WGS, Boudouard reaction and reverse gasification. At high temperature, the reverse of those reactions evidently occurred resulted in higher concentration of CO and CO selectivity. In addition, as a result of WGS and Boudouard reaction, CO2 generation gradually increased at low temperature until around 800–900K and then declined at higher temperature by the reverse of those reactions as displayed in Fig. 2(d) in term of CO2 selectivity. At low temperature, gaseous methane and solid carbon were generated from D-C2H6 and D-C3H8. The CH4 selectivity from D-C3H8 was less than from D-C2H6 whereas the former gave higher carbon formation. Among D-alcohols, glycerol was decomposed to gain highest carbon and CO2 selectivity. This is due to high CO/H2 ratio enhances Boudouard reactions rather than methanation. For SR-CH4, no carbon was occurred over the range of temperature studied and CO selectivity was around zero at low temperature due to shifting CO by WGS to produce CO2 gaining high CO2 selectivity (around 100%). Considering SR-C2H6, SR-C3H8 and SR-alcohols, it showed the similar trend as D-alcohols that these systems mainly produced CH4, CO, CO2 and carbon as by-products. Excluding SR-CH4, SR-alcohols could gain higher CO2 selectivity than those of SR-light hydrocarbon. The alcohol with higher O atom in steam reforming system resulted in a lower amount of CO but higher CO2 formation CO2 selectivities of D-alcohols were less than SR-alcohols systems because larger amount of CO2 produced by WGS from steam reforming process compared to Boudouard reaction from decomposition process. In these systems, CO was an important intermediate to convert into carbon, CO2, and CH4 selectivity. Moreover, SR-CH3OH exhibited the same profiles of by-products selectivities as those profiles from SR-C2H5OH. It was revealed that the ratios of CO/H2 from both processes are equal, causing no difference in carbon, CO2, and CH4 production. At high temperature, complete reaction of light hydrocarbon decomposition was occurred and no methane was remained. Considering D-alcohols, CO selectivity relied on reaction approach of each alcohol as summarized in reactions (4), (7) and (21). (21) Ethanol decomposition C 2 H 5 OH ⇌ C + CO + 3 H 2 Δ H 0 = 124.8 kJ mol − 1 It was noticed that CO selectivities from D-CH3OH and D-C3H8O3 almost reaches 100% whereas the value from D-C2H5OH approaches ca. 50%. This behavior was due to ethanol could decompose into by-products, carbon and CO equally in D-C2H5OH whereas only CO was formed in D-CH3OH and D-C3H8O3. For CH4 and CO2, the selectivity values were around zero because both by-products could be entirely consumed to other products. Methane was typically decomposed into carbon and hydrogen, while CO2 was generally consumed to form CO by RWGS [reverse water-gas shift, reverse of reaction (18)] and Boudouard reaction at high temperature. In case of steam reforming, no carbon and CH4 selectivity were observed for all primary fuels. The CO2 selectivity was dependent on ratio of CO/H2. Regarding CO2 selectivity, SR-CH4 and SR-C3H8O3 showed the lowest and the highest values, respectively, and the opposite tendency was found in CO selectivity."
4,Energy self-sustained systems,"3.2 Energy self-sustained systems In order to study the decomposition and steam reforming under thermally self-sustained condition, it was firstly necessary to concentrate on the heat requirement of each system as illustrated in Fig. 3 . Typically, the main reactions of decomposition and steam reforming were endothermic reaction. It was apparently revealed that the steam reforming systems are higher endothermic reaction. Since the requirement of water for steam reforming system, heat of vaporization should be taken into account. Higher water supplied to the system caused higher in heat of system as obviously seen in SR-C3H8. Therefore, heat requirement of the steam reforming system mainly relied on the amount of water fed into the system. Regarding the decomposition system, heat requirement of D-C3H8O3 was the highest at high temperature among all decomposition processes due to largely high enthalpy of glycerol compared to those of other primary fuels. However, it was found that the system can operate under exothermic reaction at low temperature because the possible exothermic side reactions such as reverse methane cracking, methanation, Boudouard reaction, and reverse gasification can take place even the endothermic of main reaction is involved. Under the energy self-sustained condition, the systems of hydrogen production could be performed as illustrated the operation modes in Fig. 1(a) and (b). In order to control the net heat of each system, the change in feed fraction to the burner (1− f D or 1− f SR) or gas product fraction to the burner (1− g D or 1− g SR) was observed that depends upon the reaction temperature. Owing to the heat of reaction as shown in Fig. 3, the values of feed and product fraction tended to decrease when the system was conducted at higher operating temperature (data not shown). The f D values of every primary fuel is greater than the f SR because of greatly higher in heat requirement for steam reforming. Due to no heat required for exothermic system at low temperature, it was not necessary to separate the primary fuel to the burner; hence, f D of each primary fuel was equal to 1. In addition, the tendency of gas product fraction profiles was also found to be similar to that of feed fraction to reactor ones. It could be presumed that the thermally self-sustained operations affect not only feed fraction of each primary fuel to the reactor or product fraction, but also the reaction performances. The major reaction performances obtained from the systems under the thermally self-sustained operations such as hydrogen production, purity of hydrogen, mole fraction of CO in product stream, and carbon yield were also investigated in this work. The simulation results are illustrated in Figs. 4–7 . It was revealed that the differences in hydrogen production (Fig. 4) and carbon yield (Fig. 7) can be reasonably appeared between splitting feed and gas product but the hydrogen purity and CO fraction in both cases are similar (Figs. 5 and 6). As seen in Fig. 4, it is clearly indicated that high hydrogen produced can be obtained from splitting feed for each primary fuel. The SR-C3H8 gave the highest hydrogen production at temperature ca. 1050K. Below this temperature, WGS played an important role in increasing the hydrogen generation. However, RWGS could be easily taken place at high temperature, hence more hydrogen was consumed by this reaction. Therefore, the hydrogen produced was decreased beyond the maximum point. Similar profiles of hydrogen production were found in the steam reforming fed by others primary fuels. The decrement in hydrogen production profiles corresponded to lower in stoichiometric coefficient of hydrogen in their overall steam reforming of primary fuels. Nonetheless, SR-C2H6 and SR-C3H8O3 should be achieved the similar maximum mole of hydrogen of 7, the hydrogen produced of the former showed higher profile than the latter. It was probably suggested that higher concentration of CO2 in the latter causes higher hydrogen reduction by consuming via RWGS. As considered the decomposition systems, the tendency of hydrogen production related to their reaction approaches [reactions (1)–(4), (7), and (21)] at high temperature. At similar C and H atoms in primary fuel such as CH4 and CH3OH etc., it should be gained the mole of hydrogen produced identically at high temperature but D-light hydrocarbon produced hydrogen higher than D-alcohol over the temperature range studied. Hydrogen was obtained from thermal cracking and could further consumed by reverse methane cracking in D-light hydrocarbon but lower amount of hydrogen remained in D-alcohol due to higher hydrogen consumption by the reaction of CO by-product such as methanation, reverse gasification and reverse methane cracking. Therefore, CO was a major factor affected lesser hydrogen production for D-alcohol. However, the feed fraction to reactor also influenced hydrogen production. It was apparently revealed that D-light hydrocarbon exhibit significantly higher f D value compared to D-alcohol. In case of splitting gas product, it was found that the hydrogen produced was less than the case of splitting feed for all D- and SR-reactant feed. In addition, the difference in hydrogen production was more pronounced from the system fed by primary fuel with containing higher C atom. The decrement in hydrogen produced was observed and it further decreased at high temperature because of the reduction in gas product fraction (g D or g SR). However, concerning primary fuels with the same C and H atoms, the hydrogen gained did not follow the tendency of splitting feed case, especially at high temperature. The hydrogen produced from D-alcohol was higher than that from D-light hydrocarbon due to higher g D. In case of the steam reforming, the profiles of splitting feed were similar to that of splitting gas product, of which SR-light hydrocarbons gave higher H2 yield than that of SR-alcohols for similar C and H atoms. For purity of hydrogen, the results are displayed in Fig. 5. Owing to the absence of any gaseous by-products in the decomposition of light hydrocarbon, the purified hydrogen (100%) could be achieved at high temperature. Since requirement of water in steam reforming, the steam reforming of each primary fuel could obtain less hydrogen purity than the decomposition one. Various by-products were formed in D-alcohol compared to D-light hydrocarbon, leading to lower hydrogen purity. Among D-alcohols, the highest purity of hydrogen could be gained from D-C2H5OH. Furthermore, the hydrogen purity from decomposition of each primary fuel related to concentration of hydrogen in product stream based on the complete reaction of each system at high temperature. It was disclosed that the hydrogen purity from D-C3H8O3 was less than SR-light hydrocarbon. Generally, amount of by-products of CO and CO2 greatly occurred from D-C3H8O3 and SR-light hydrocarbon. However, glycerol might be decomposed into higher concentration of by-products due to containing high O atom in this primary fuel. In Fig. 6 is demonstrated the mole fraction of CO as a function of temperature. The decomposition of alcohol showed high level of CO concentration and the highest CO fraction was obtained from D-C3H8O3. It is indicated that the fraction of CO from all systems followed the ratio of CO/H2 in each reaction approach. In case of D-alcohols, CO fraction increased with increasing temperature until the value is constant at temperature around 1200K, whereas the CO fraction keeps increasing as a function of temperature over the range of study in the steam reforming process (both alcohols and light hydrocarbons). This was probably due to the occurrence of RWGS in the steam reforming systems at high temperature. In the steam reforming, SR-alcohol gave higher CO concentration than SR-light hydrocarbon. This result was probably due to lower hydrogen content obtained in case of SR-alcohol as depicted in Fig. 5. At high temperature, CO and H2O fractions were similar accompanied with less portion of CO2. Therefore, the fractions of H2 and CO reasonably related to each other. Among the steam reforming processes, it was found that SR-C3H8O3 exhibited the highest CO fraction since the highest CO produced and the lowest H2 content. Lastly, the carbon yields of all systems are illustrated in Fig. 7. The profiles in case of splitting gas product stream were firstly discussed (where f D or f SR equal to 1). At low temperature, the solid carbon could be obviously formed with help of related CO reactions. In case of no CO produced in the system, carbon formation could be obtained from light hydrocarbon cracking and it still tended to increase at higher temperature. According to the decomposition reactions, the sequence of carbon yield value from D-light hydrocarbon was in the order of D-C3H8 >D-C2H6 >D-CH4. However, D-alcohol exhibited higher carbon yield at low temperature compared to D-light hydrocarbon as higher CO was formed and high ratio of CO/H2 was observed, resulting in the production of carbon according to the Boudouard reaction. The highest CO intermediate generation was achieved from D-C3H8O3, resulting in obtaining the highest carbon formation. At a certain value of C and H atoms in primary fuel, carbon obtained from D-alcohols was higher than those obtained from D-light hydrocarbon depending on the routes of carbon formation. As considered the equilibrium constant, Boudouard reaction occurred in D-alcohols was preferred to form carbon rather than D-light hydrocarbon. Although CO was also occurred from the steam reforming process, it showed lower carbon yield than the decomposition one. Due to high amount of water acting as a diluent in the steam reforming system, it could reduce the concentration of CO intermediate, leading to suppressing the carbon formation. In addition, it was found that SR-alcohols could obtain higher carbon formation compared to SR-light hydrocarbons. It was reasonably pointed out that the O atom in alcohol can play an important role in forming a number of CO that further obtains high carbon deposition. Like D-C3H8O3, glycerol still provided the highest carbon yield among the steam reforming systems. Considering the processes at high temperature, 100% of carbon yield could be achieved in case of light hydrocarbon fuel with splitting gas product because the decomposition reaction of light hydrocarbon was completed. For the systems with the presence of CO2 and H2O, no carbon was observed at high temperature because it could react via the reverse of reactions (15)–(17). However, it was found that high carbon was produced from D-C2H5OH at high temperature. This was presumably due to methane produced as a major by-product and it was further decomposed to carbon at high temperature. Compared between splitting feed and splitting gas product stream, the carbon yields in case of splitting feed were found to be lower than those of splitting gas product as particularly seen in the decomposition processes at high temperature. For instance, the maximum carbon yield values of D-light hydrocarbon reduced from 100% to around 80%. The decrease in the carbon yield obtained from each system resulted from the change in feed fraction value. Moreover, the value of carbon yield tended to gradually decrease at high temperature as a result of the reduction in f D values. In the case of the steam reforming processes, splitting feed gave slightly lower carbon yield than that of splitting gas product. However, it should be noted that the steam reforming as widely used in many industries was typically processed by using an excess of steam to prevent carbon formation on the catalyst. The requirement of steam in order to avoid the presence of coke should be higher than the minimum ratio of steam to carbon atom of primary fuel (S/C). The results from this work were revealed that those minimum ratios are 1.6, 2.1, 2.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 2.6 for the steam reforming of methane, ethane, propane, methanol, ethanol, and glycerol, respectively. It was clearly seen that the value of S/C for SR-CH4 (S/C =2) is in the range of no carbon formation whereas those values for the steam reforming of other primary fuels are lower than the boundary of minimum ratio, resulting in the possible carbon formation especially at low temperature. In the case of SR-C2H6 and SR-C3H8 at low temperature, these primary fuels are preferably converted to lighter hydrocarbons, H2, and carbon rather than being reacted via the steam reforming reaction as a result of higher values of the equilibrium constants. However, methane was then produced by the reverse of methane cracking. The methane steam reforming accompanied with WGS was occurred to produce CO and CO2 as by-products. In addition, CO was an intermediate by-product to generate carbon via Boudouard reaction and reverse gasification of C to CO. For SR-alcohols, alcohols could be converted to H2 and CO via both cracking and steam reforming reactions. Higher CO intermediate presented at low temperature, compared to SR-light hydrocarbon systems, could be further reacted by WGS, methanation, Boudouard reaction, and reverse gasification of C to CO and was eventually formed the carbon. With the excess of steam in the range of no carbon formation, the combination of the steam reforming reaction and WGS was mainly performed in the steam reforming of all primary fuels and the related reactions of carbon formation could be suppressed. Regarding the steam reforming systems with the excess of steam that was lower and higher than the minimum ratio of steam to carbon atom of primary fuel, higher steam fed to the reactor generally caused higher heat requirement of the system. In order to provide more heat, higher amount of fuel had to be supplied to the burner; hence, the feed fraction to reactor and gas product fraction were decreased when S/C increased. Although the increase in hydrogen production in term of mole of hydrogen produced for the systems with spitting feed or gas product was observed at higher value of S/C, mole fractions of H2 and CO were found to be lower due to higher content of water. In addition, the reduction in carbon yield was found at higher S/C and the disappearance of carbon could be noticed when S/C was higher than the minimum value as mentioned above."
5,Selection of suitable primary fuel of hydrogen production for fuel cell,"3.3 Selection of suitable primary fuel of hydrogen production for fuel cell The appropriate system for different fuel cell grades is dependent on the limitation of each fuel cell type. For low temperature fuel cell (PEMFC), CO concentration was restricted to be lower than 50ppm. However, CO was useful in case of high-temperature fuel cell (MCFC and SOFC) because it could be used as another fuel besides hydrogen. In general, hydrogen purity and hydrogen production were firstly considered in this determination. Nevertheless, the carbon capture in term of carbon yield was also taken into account. Under the environmental concern, the solid carbon by-product, acting as energy storage, could reasonably reduce the CO2 emission. Regarding PEMFC based on the CO limitation, the system had to be operated at low temperature to minimize the CO concentration, as shown in Fig. 6 but the hydrogen production and hydrogen purity were very low. However, the absence of CO was appeared in D-light hydrocarbon processes. Therefore, D-light hydrocarbon systems at high temperature were the promising choices. It was revealed that the systems in case of splitting feed exhibit higher in hydrogen production but lower in carbon yield compared to the systems in case of splitting gas product. Based on maximum hydrogen production, the suitable process among D-light hydrocarbon processes was D-C3H8 with splitting feed that should be operated at ca. 1275K. This process could gain the hydrogen purity up to 99% with impurity of methane and the carbon yield around 87%. Considering the carbon capture and CO2 emission, D-light hydrocarbon in case of splitting gas product was preferred to produce the feedstock for PEMFC even obtaining lower hydrogen production, compared to that in case of splitting feed. The CO2 emission from the burner was generated from oxidation of carbon-containing reactant such as light hydrocarbons and alcohols from primary fuels, and by-products i.e. CH4 and CO from the reactor. However, for D-light hydrocarbon at high temperature, lower CO2 emission from the burner was found in case of splitting gas product. It was revealed that methane by-product in case of splitting gas product is fed to the burner lower than light hydrocarbon (on carbon atom basis) in case of splitting primary fuel. In addition, the decomposition of light hydrocarbon systems with splitting gas product should be carried out at ca. 1100K to obtain the maximum value of hydrogen production. At this temperature, 97% of hydrogen purity with methane as impurity and 97% of carbon yield could be obtained. Among D-light hydrocarbons, ethane and propane could achieve higher hydrogen production, compared to methane. However, ethane and propane have been widely used for producing higher product value, but methane is available and often used as heating source. Hence, methane was possibly suggested to be employed in the decomposition process for supplying to PEMFC. Nonetheless, the product stream from D-alcohol and the steam reforming systems could also be fed to PEMFC after reducing the CO concentration by water-gas shift and preferential oxidation reactors. For high-temperature fuel cell such as MCFC and SOFC, no limitation of CO fraction was involved. In this case, H2 and CO can be used as fuel source, whereas CH4, CO2, and H2O were diluent. Therefore, D-light hydrocarbon with high hydrogen purity and D-alcohol with major products of H2 and CO were preferred to match MCFC and SOFC. Like the PEMFC case, since the criteria of carbon capture and CO2 emission were concerned, the decomposition processes in case of splitting gas product were reasonably selected. For D-light hydrocarbons, it should be operated at ca. 1100K as mentioned above. In the case of D-alcohol, the operating temperature of this system should be around 1175K to achieve the highest hydrogen production, D-C2H5OH could obtain the highest values of the ratio of H2/CO, hydrogen purity, and carbon yield. The hydrogen purity of 74% and CO 24% content were obtained from this system with 2% impurity of CH4, CO2 and H2O. Moreover, in case of splitting gas product, D-alcohol gave higher CO2 emission from the burner than D-light hydrocarbon as a result of higher CO generation. However, D-CH3OH and D-C3H8O3 with lower ratio of H2/CO were also possible to carry out at operating temperature of ca. 1225K. Under the criteria of the highest hydrogen production, D-C3H8 in case of splitting primary fuel was preferable among the decomposition systems. Compared to the decomposition systems, the product stream from the steam reforming systems could be also applied to MCFC and SOFC but lower power density of fuel cell would be achieved, relying on the criteria. Nevertheless, hydrogen production from the steam reforming process could be improved by additionally conventional processes such as shift reactor and preferential oxidation reactor. Practically, the steam reforming gives higher hydrogen production than the decomposition, but the former is more complicate. The vaporizer should be equipped with the steam reforming reactor to heat up the water supply to the system. Moreover, it is necessary to operate with larger volume of reactor due to additional water. For example, SR-C3H8 gives the highest mole of hydrogen produced but it requires larger amount of water 6 times of propane. In addition, higher cost should be appeared due to more complexity of the process. For the decomposition process, no vaporizer is required and the reactor is smaller compared to the steam reforming even obtaining lower hydrogen production. Furthermore, the steam reforming requires other reactors to reduce the CO concentration and to enhance the hydrogen production for applying to fuel cell whereas it is not necessary for the decomposition system at high temperature. Moreover, no carbon capture is observed from the steam reforming at high temperature but it is apparently obtained via the decomposition. In conclusion, the decomposition process was preferable to be compatible with various kinds of fuel cells such as PEMFC, MCFC and SOFC."
6,Conclusions,"The thermodynamic analyses of hydrogen production by the decomposition and the steam reforming under energy self-sustained condition were investigated in this work. Several primary fuels such as light hydrocarbons and alcohols were taken into account. Although steam reforming of C3H8 with splitting feed gave the highest hydrogen production, however, we suggest that the decomposition process with splitting gas product is more beneficial in term of hydrogen purity and environmental concern as totally carbon capture. The product stream from D-light hydrocarbons was certainly suitable for feeding to PEMFC since there is no impurity of CO. Among D-light hydrocarbons, D-C3H8 yielded maximum hydrogen production at 1275K. On the other hand, D-alcohols could be used for high-temperature fuel cell such as MCFC or SOFC, especially D-C2H5OH, because it provided the highest H2/CO. Although, D-CH3OH and D-C3H8O3 have lower H2/CO ratio but they still have advantage over the steam reforming as higher power density of fuel cell is obtained."
