0,Introduction,"Selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols to the corresponding aldehyde or ketone compounds plays an important role in industrial applications, such as perfumes, additives, and pesticides [1,2]. However, traditional methods to convert aromatic alcohols usually require specific conditions, such as high temperature, high pressure, and noble metal catalysts [3,4]. This, in turn, requires proprietary equipment with high costs and energy consumption. In contrast, photocatalytic alcohol oxidation has gained much attention due to its safety and potential direct use of solar energy [5–7]. Typically, photocatalytic alcohol oxidation relies on the photoinduced holes of the photocatalyst. Under oxygen-rich conditions, oxygen serves as an electron acceptor to enhance the reaction of holes with alcohols, the mechanism which has been mostly accepted [8–12]. By using hydrogen protons as electron acceptors, alcohol oxidation can make full use of electrons and holes to obtain hydrogen and carbonyl compounds simultaneously [13–15]. However, the carbonyl compounds obtained by the photocatalytic oxidation of alcohols tend to be further decomposed by nonselective superoxide/hydroxyl radicals and holes. Thus, selectivity regulation turns out to be the core obstacle to photocatalytic oxidation. Generally, there are three strategies to improve the selectivity of photocatalytic oxidation: sacrificial agent application, oxidative ability regulation, and reaction site modification. For example, using benzotrifluoride or acetonitrile as a reactive solvent effectively inhibits the production of nonselective hydroxyl radicals [16–18]. However, this strategy requires additional resource consumption and poses greater environmental risk. There is an urgent demand for the development of methods to use green and cheap media such as water for the conversion of alcohols. In addition, the regulation of the valance and conduction bands of semiconductors is an acceptable strategy to precisely control the oxidative ability of holes. With the specific oxidative ability, oxidation would be terminated when a specific product was obtained, thus providing high selectivity. CdS has been widely studied due to its narrow band gap (2.4 eV) [19,20]. The oxidative ability is sufficient for the oxidation of alcohols but is not so strong that overoxidation will occur. However, the rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers severely influences their photocatalytic activity. The construction of heterostructures has been a well-accepted strategy to overcome this problem [21,22]. CdS-MoS2 heterostructures have been confirmed to improve performance in photocatalysis compared to individual CdS heterostructures. Therefore, in a recent study, a one-pot synthesized CdS-MoS2 heterostructure was used as the photocatalyst for the photocatalytic oxidation of alcohols [23]. Catalytic reactive sites play a vital role in the reaction rate and selectivity. In addition to noble metals like Pt and Au, which possess remarkable efficiency for the catalytic oxidation of alcohols [24–27], several nonnoble metals, such as Ni, Cu, and Mn, have been proven to be efficient in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. The activation of Ni in molecular oxidation was first studied in Ni-Al hydrotalcite for the selective oxidation of alcohols [28]. The authors proposed that Ni atoms should be the active sites in Ni-Al hydrotalcite. The catalytic properties of Ni were confirmed by subsequent studies. Ni(OH)2 and NiO2 powders were reported to possess effective oxidation properties for benzyl alcohol [29,30]. The catalytic ability of Ni(OH)2 on benzyl alcohol oxidation was further confirmed by the electrochemical oxidation process [31]. Therefore, it is believed that the construction of Ni(OH)2 on CdS-MoS2 heterostructures will provide reasonably efficient photocatalytic alcohol oxidation. In this work, we report a novel Ni(OH)2-modified CdS-MoS2 photocatalyst for the highly effective oxidation of benzyl alcohol in pure water under visible light irradiation at ambient conditions. The benzyl alcohol oxidation rate and selectivity were discussed with various contents of Ni(OH)2 on the CdS-MoS2 heterostructure. The benzyl alcohol conversion reached 94.2% with a benzaldehyde selectivity of 99% after 9 h of visible light illumination. The effect of Ni(OH)2 on the enhanced photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol was confirmed, and the mechanism was systematically discussed."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Molybdenum trioxide (MoO3), cadmium acetate (Cd(CH3COO)2.2 H2O), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2.6 H2O), triethanolamine (C6H15NO3, TEOA), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), and thioacetamide (CH3CSNH2) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde were obtained from Shanghai Alighting Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. The above reagents were all of analytical grade and used without further purification. Ultrapure water from a Ulupure UPR-II-10 T purification system was used throughout the experiment (18.25 MΩ cm−1)."
3,Synthesis of photocatalysts,"2.2 Synthesis of photocatalysts 2.2.1 Preparation of CdS-MoS2 heterostructure The CdS-MoS2 heterostructure was prepared via a typical hydrothermal method [32]. Briefly, Cd(CH3COO)2.2 H2O (0.267 g), MoO3 (0.288 g), and CH3CSNH2 (0.564 g) were dissolved in 40 mL deionized water and stirred for 30 min. Then, the mixed solution was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave for a 24 h reaction at 200 °C. Finally, the obtained sample was washed with deionized water three times and then dried at 60 °C. At this point, the CdS-MoS2 powder was prepared. 2.2.2 Preparation of Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 composites The Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 composites were prepared by the precipitation of Ni2+ in a CdS-MoS2 suspension. First, 1 mmol (0.304 g) of as-prepared CdS-MoS2 was dispersed in NaOH solution (75 mL, 0.25 mol/L). Then, a specified amount of Ni(NO3)2.6 H2O solution (0.05 mol/L) were added dropwise into the CdS-MoS2 suspension and stirred for 4 h. Ni(OH)2 mole ratios of 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% compared to CdS rather than MoS2 were used. After washing with ethanol and deionized water several times and drying at 60 °C, various samples of Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 composites were obtained. 2.2.3 Preparation of Ni-CdS-MoS2 composites The Ni-CdS-MoS2 composites were prepared by the photoreduction of Ni2+ on CdS-MoS2 with Ni mole ratios of 1%, 3%, 6%, 9% and 12% compared to CdS. Typically, 2 mmol (0.29 g) of as-prepared CdS-MoS2 was dispersed in a mixture of water (32 mL) and methyl alcohol (8 mL). Certain amounts of NiCl2.6 H2O (0.024 mmol, 0.072 mmol, or 0.144 mmol) were added to the suspension. Then, the system was degassed and illuminated for 2 h with a Xe lamp. The obtained samples were washed with water and ethanol and then dried at 60 °C. Finally, Ni-CdS-MoS2 (1, 3, 6, 9, 12%) composites were obtained."
4,Characterization,2.3 Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements were performed on a Rigaku D/max-gB X-ray diffractometer with a Cu-Kα sealed tube (λ = 1.5406 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded by an ESCALAB 250 instrument. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2100 electron microscope. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental mapping was performed using a TECNAI F30 electron microscope. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a JEOL JSM-6700F field-emission scanning electron microscope. The Ni contents of Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) analysis.
5,Electrochemical measurements,"2.4 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical measurements were performed on a CHI660E Electrochemical Workstation in a conventional three-electrode system using Pt slices and Ag/AgCl (with saturated KCl aqueous solution) as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. The working electrodes were obtained as follows: 4 mg of the photocatalyst sample and 50 μL of 5% Nafion were added to 1 mL ethanol under ultrasound for 20 min. Then, the suspension was added dropwise and uniformly to the surface of the F-doped SnO2-coated glass (FTO glass) and dried at 37 °C for 12 h to produce the working electrode. The transient photocurrent responses were detected with the lamp on and off for fixed 50-second intervals. A 300 W Xe lamp (λ ≥ 420 nm) was used as the light source, and 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (pH=7) served as the electrolyte. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out in the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz with a 50 mV amplitude at an open-circle potential."
6,Photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol,"2.5 Photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol The photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol was performed in 400-mL custom-made glass with a quartz window. First, 40 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed in 20 mL deionized water containing 125 μmol of benzyl alcohol under ultrasonication and stirred for 40 min. A 300 W Xe lamp with an optical filter (λ > 420 nm) was used as the light source. Before illumination, the reaction system was purged with high purity argon three times to remove the air inside and create anaerobic conditions. After adsorption equilibrium was reached in the dark between the photocatalyst and benzyl alcohol, the suspension was illuminated and kept at 25 °C with circulating water. After illumination, the suspension was filtered through a 0.22 µm membrane filter to remove the catalyst. Then, the solution was injected into a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC, C18 column, injection volume: 20 μL, water:methyl alcohol = 30:70, detection wavelength: 254 nm, flow rate: 1.0 mL/min, column temperature: 30 °C) for benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde quantification. The conversion of alcohol and selectivity of aldehyde were calculated as follows: Conversion (%) = [(C0-Calcohol)/C0]×100 Selectivity (%) = [Caldehyde/(C0-Calcohol)]×100 where C0 is the initial concentration of alcohol and Calcohol and Caldehyde are the concentrations of the substrates benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde after reaction, respectively. Cyclic tests for photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol in pure water with Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 were also carried out. After one cycle of photocatalysis, the catalyst was extracted by centrifugation at 10000 rpm. After being washed with deionized water and ethanol three times, the photocatalyst was dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven. The photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol was then repeated for 9 h of light illumination. A total of 5 reaction cycles were performed."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Morphology and composition of the as-prepared Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 photocatalyst,"3.1 Morphology and composition of the as-prepared Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 photocatalyst The morphology of the as-prepared Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 photocatalyst was characterized by SEM, TEM, and HRTEM, as shown in Fig. 1. The catalysts with a 20% mole ratio of Ni(OH)2 are aggregate shaped with sizes ranging from dozens to hundreds of nanometers (Fig. 1a and b). However, both CdS-MoS2 and 6% Ni-CdS-MoS2 have flower-like shapes several hundred nanometers in size (Fig. S1, Supporting Information). This indicates that the CdS-MoS2 is wrapped by Ni(OH)2. Interplanar spacings of 0.63, 0.33, and 0.27 nm are detected in the HRTEM image and are assigned to the (002) plane of MoS2 [33,34], the (111) plane of CdS [35,36], and the (100) plane of Ni(OH)2 [37], respectively (Fig. 1c). The corresponding elemental mapping images (Fig. 1d) show the uniform distribution of Ni, O, S, Cd and Mo in mapping images due to the one-step synthesis of CdS-MoS2 heterojunction. As shown in Fig. 1e, Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 with a 20% mole ratio of Ni(OH)2 was analyzed by XRD, and the pattern can be assigned to hexagonal CdS (JCPDS card77–2306) only. No diffraction peaks of Ni(OH)2 or MoS2 are identified in Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2, which is due to the low crystallinity and nanoflake morphology of Ni(OH)2 and MoS2 [37,38]. Similar results are noticed for the samples of CdS-MoS2, 6% Ni-CdS-MoS2, and all the other Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 samples with different mole ratios of Ni(OH)2 (Fig. S2, Supporting Information)."
9,Photocatalytic property of Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 composites,"3.2 Photocatalytic property of Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 composites The photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol in pure water under ambient conditions with Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 composites was also studied, as shown in Fig. 2. The quantitative analysis is based on the standard curves of benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde (Fig. S3, Supporting Information). The nominal mole ratios of Ni(OH)2 on CdS-MoS2 were set to 0, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%. The actually mole ratios of Ni(OH)2 on CdS-MoS2 are analyzed as 0%, 4.2%, 9.5%, 14.5%, 32.4%, and 36.9% by ICP-MS. The values analyzed from the ICP-MS measurements are similar to the designed ratios. More benzyl alcohol is converted into benzaldehyde during photocatalysis with longer visible light illumination time (Fig. 2a). The conversion of benzyl alcohol increases with increasing Ni(OH)2 content on CdS-MoS2 heterostructures until reaching a mole ratio of 20% then decrease with further increasing Ni(OH)2 contents. The conversion of benzyl alcohol under 9 h illumination is 94.2%, which is 5 times higher than that of CdS-MoS2 (18.9%). The increased conversion is likely due to the catalytic oxidation property of Ni(OH)2 [39–41], while the decreased conversion when Ni(OH)2 was overloaded could be attributed to the Ni(OH)2 layer blocking light irradiation of the CdS-MoS2 nanostructures and to the reduction of surface active sites covered with too much Ni(OH)2. Surprisingly, the catalyst loaded with 40% Ni(OH)2 on CdS-MoS2 still provided a 65.0% conversion, which was 3.6 times higher than that of CdS-MoS2. The reaction kinetics were analyzed as shown in Fig. 2b, and they were found to show first-order behavior. The conversion rate constants, K, are 0.02, 0.11, 0.06, 0.32, 0.18, and 0.11 h−1 with Ni(OH)2 contents of 0, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%, respectively. The conversion rate of the optimized photocatalyst with 20% Ni(OH)2 is approximately 16 times that of CdS-MoS2. The selectivities of benzaldehyde are all ~99% with CdS-MoS2 and various Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 photocatalysts. This implies that Ni(OH)2 controls the conversion rate instead of the selectivity in this composite photocatalyst. To study the possible mechanism of the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol with Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 in pure water under ambient conditions, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), triethanolamine (TEOA), isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and p-benzoquinone (BQ) were used as scavengers to capture photogenerated electrons, holes, hydroxyl radicals (·OH) and superoxide radicals (·O2 -)respectively [42–44]. As shown in Fig. 2c, all experiments showed a high selectivity of approximately 99%. However, the conversion of benzyl alcohol is different. The conversion rates of the reaction with the addition of electron capture CCl4 and hole capture TEOA are 95.1% and 9.5%, respectively. The conversion rate of benzaldehyde with an electron capture agent increased slightly compared with the control experiment (94.2%). This indicates that the photoinduced holes rather than electrons is responsible for photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol. The conversion of benzaldehyde in the presence of the hole capture agent TEOA significantly decreased compared with that of the control sample, which indicates that it is primarily the photoinduced holes that participate in the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol. The competitive oxidation by holes of TEOA and benzyl alcohol leads to a low conversion. When IPA is introduced in the reaction system, the conversion of benzyl alcohol is almost the same with the blank, indicating that hydroxyl radicals cannot work or produce. Besides, the anaerobic condition can prevent the O2 from reacting with electrons to generate superoxide radicals. Thus, the introduction of BQ in the reaction system will also not influence the conversion of benzyl alcohol compared with the blank group."
10,The property of photo-induced charges,"3.3 The property of photo-induced charges To elucidate the effect of the loading of Ni(OH)2 on the improvement of photocatalytic benzyl alcohol oxidation in depth, electrochemical and fluorescent lifetime measurements of the different samples were performed to analyze the fate of photoinduced charge carriers ( Fig. 3). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to analyze the electric properties, indicative of the separation and transfer of charge carriers in the photoelectrode. A small arc radius in the Nyquist plots usually indicates a smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct) in the photoelectrode, in turn indicating that the charge carriers were separated effectively and transferred quickly. As shown in Fig. 3a, the charge transfer resistances (Rcts) of 20% Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 and CdS-MoS2 are 61.9 Ω and 65.9 Ω, respectively, as analyzed from the Nyquist plots. The difference in the Rct values is not comparable to the observed improvement in oxidation performance. This implies that the main effect of Ni(OH)2 on the conversion rate is not derived from the charge transfer resistance. It also shows that Ni(OH)2 possesses semiconductor properties. From Fig. 3b, we can see that the light adsorption of Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 is higher than that of CdS-MoS2 in the range of 300–800 nm, which indicates that the loading of Ni(OH)2 can enhance the light adsorption properties of CdS-MoS2. There might be photo-induce charges generated by the light absorption. However, we measured the photocurrent of the Ni(OH)2, and no obvious current was detected. It indicates the low photo-induced charges generated from Ni(OH)2 (Fig. S4 in the supporting information). Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 shows a photocurrent response that is ~3 times higher than that of CdS-MoS2 under light illumination (Fig. 3c), suggesting that more charge carriers were excited and separated. In addition, the time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy in Fig. 3d shows that 20% Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 possesses a longer fluorescent lifetime (8.53 ns) than CdS-MoS2 (1.99 ns). These results indicate that Ni(OH)2 plays an important role in increasing the photoinduced charge concentration. As has been well studied in electrochemical oxygen evolution, Ni(OH)2 possesses high hole transport properties [45–47]. Therefore, it is believed that Ni(OH)2 on CdS-MoS2 acts as a hole-transport layer to benefit the charge carrier separation and surface oxidation."
11,The cyclic property with the composite evolution,"3.4 The cyclic property with the composite evolution The photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol with 20% Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 was performed five times to evaluate its cyclic properties. As shown in Fig. 4a, the conversion of benzyl alcohol remains at approximately 90%, and the selectivity of benzaldehyde remains at 99% after 5 cycles. The morphology, crystalline structure, and composition analyzed by SEM, HRTEM, XRD, and XPS show no detectable changes in the 20% Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 composite photocatalyst after 5 cycles (Fig. S5-S7, Supporting Information). These results indicate good recyclability and stability during the photocatalytic oxidation reaction. Notably, after the photocatalytic process, the reaction system shows a slight color deepening, from dark green to black (inset of Fig. 4b). No characteristic absorption band was detected in the UV-Vis spectra before or after photocatalysis, but the full absorption was improved (Fig. 4b). The variations in the contents of Ni, Mo, S, and Cd before and after reaction for 9 h, 18 h, and 36 h were analyzed by XPS. There were no obvious changes detected in the binding energy or chemical state of Mo, S, or Cd (Fig. S8-S10 and Table S1, Supporting Information). However, the chemical state of Ni shows differences after photocatalysis for various times. As shown in Fig. 4c, the peaks at 856.8 and 874.4 eV correspond to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively, of Ni 2p before photocatalysis. There are satellite peaks of Ni at 879.9 and 861.9 eV, which can be ignored during chemical state analysis [48]. This confirms the pure chemical state of Ni2+ in the 20% Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 composite photocatalyst. After 9 h of photocatalysis, the peaks assigned to Ni0 are detected at 853.7 and 871.4 eV, which are associated with Ni0 2p3/2 and Ni0 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. 4d) [48–50]. Approximately 21.8% of the Ni2+ was reduced to Ni0 during 9 h photocatalysis. Furthermore, 28.4% and 33.1% of Ni2+ was reduced to Ni0 during the 18 h and 36 h photocatalytic oxidation processes, respectively (Fig. 4e and f). The gradually decreasing conversion of Ni2+ to Ni0 indicates that the Ni0 on the surface may protect the inner Ni2+ from self-reduction due to the fast electron transfer and electron active site. The Ni2+ reduction is not the driving force for the improved charge separation [51]. There was metallic Ni formed in the Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 composite photocatalyst; the observed color change was due to its formation. The role of metallic Ni was further studied by using Ni-CdS-MoS2 to photocatalytically oxidize benzyl alcohol. Ni-CdS-MoS2 shows a thin-layer structure, which is the typical morphology of MoS2 (Fig. 4g). As shown in Fig. 4h, all photocatalysts with 1%, 3%, or 6% metallic Ni can achieve high selectivity, up to 99%, for oxidizing benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. This provides additional evidence that the variation in selectivity is related to the CdS-MoS2 heterostructure instead of the loading of Ni(OH)2. With the loading of a 1% mole ratio of Ni0 on CdS-MoS2, the conversion of benzyl alcohol increases to 24.7% from 14.2%, almost doubling. With an increased amount of Ni0, the conversion of benzyl alcohol increases to 28.6% and 40.5% for Ni0 contents of 3% and 6%, respectively. The conversion of benzyl alcohol of 9% and 12% Ni-CdS-MoS2 are 44.2% and 45.4%, respectively. These results show the conversion of benzyl alcohol of 9% Ni-CdS-MoS2 increasing slowly compared with that of 6% Ni-CdS-MoS2. The conversion of benzyl alcohol of 12% Ni-CdS-MoS2 is the same as that of 9% Ni-CdS-MoS2, proving the increase of Ni0 loading content more than 9% cannot influence the conversion of benzyl alcohol obviously. The exposed active site of Ni0 might be saturated with the 9% Ni0 loading content of CdS-MoS2. As discussed above, there would be ~5.6% Ni0 in 20% Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 after 18 h of photocatalysis, when the conversion is still over 90%. This is much higher than that of 6% Ni-CdS-MoS2. Ni0 is beneficial to the effective adsorption of alcohols and the desorption of aldehydes [52]. This is the reason for the improvement in oxidation performance with metallic Ni on CdS-MoS2. Moreover, Ni2+ and Ni0 can adsorb the α-H of benzyl alcohol and serve as the dehydrogenation unit of benzyl alcohol [5,53]; thus, there is a synergistic effect of Ni2+ and Ni0 to enhance the conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. The Raman spectra confirm the existence of MoS2 and Ni(OH)2 in the composite photocatalysts, and no detectable change is identified before and after the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. S11, Supporting Information)."
12,The mechanism of the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol with Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2,"3.5 The mechanism of the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol with Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 The photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol with Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 is illustrated in Fig. 5. The photocatalyst produces electrons and holes under the excitation of visible light. A part of Ni2+ will be reduced by photoinduced electrons to Ni0, and the existence of metallic Ni prevents more Ni2+ from self-reduction. Ni0 is beneficial to the effective adsorption of benzyl alcohol and the desorption of benzaldehyde. Firstly, a proton abstracted from the OH group of the benzyl alcohol is adsorbed on Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 surface. Then, another proton abstracted from C–H adsorbed on Ni site [5,23,54]. Thus, a carbon-centered radical and two abstracted protons are generated. The carbon-centered radical is oxidized by holes to form benzaldehyde and two abstracted protons are reduced by electrons to produce H2. The Ni(OH)2 loading on CdS-MoS2 could work as a hole-transport layer. More holes will transfer to the catalytic surface, helping to achieve efficient benzyl alcohol oxidation. Ni2+ and Ni0 both provide adsorption sites for the α-H of benzyl alcohol, forming the dehydrogenation units of benzyl alcohol. The synergistic effect of Ni(OH)2 and metallic Ni plays an important role in enhancing the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde."
13,Conclusion,"In summary, a series of Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 composites with diﬀerent Ni(OH)2 mole ratios were synthesized and applied to the photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. The 20% Ni(OH)2-CdS-MoS2 photocatalyst exhibited the highest conversion for benzyl alcohol oxidation as compared with CdS-MoS2 and Ni-CdS-MoS2. The Ni(OH)2 loading on CdS-MoS2 worked as a hole-transport layer and enhanced the photoinduced charge separation by transporting more holes to the surface. Ni(OH)2 and metallic Ni create more highly reactive sites, providing synergistic effects to enhance the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. This work provided a new approach for the reasonable design of high-activity photocatalysts without the use of sacrificial agents or noble metal catalysts to achieve organic synthesis for effective solar energy utilization."
