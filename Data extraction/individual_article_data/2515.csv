0,Introduction,"With the global attention to the environmental protection of the atmosphere, the emission of automobile exhaust is feeling more and more pressure, seeking alternative fuels, clean energy is a good way to improve engine emissions and reduce oil dependence [1–7]. Looking for renewable clean energy such as hydrogen, alcohol and natural gas [8–13] is one of the most important ways to develop automobiles. Hydrogen has low ignition energy and fast flame propagation, so hydrogen can burn better and has a good effect on improving engine performance [14–15]. And hydrogen does not contain carbon, which can effectively reduce CO and CO2 emissions. Therefore, hydrogen is being studied by more and more people as a renewable and clean energy source. However, pure hydrogen has low heating value of hydrogen on volume basis and is used in SI engines to cause a decrease in engine power performance [16,17]. Moreover, the production cost of hydrogen is relatively high, and storage and transportation are also difficult and dangerous, which also restricts the development of hydrogen. However, hydrogen can be mixed with some hydrocarbon fuels as an alternative fuel, taking advantage of both fuels to improve engine performance [18]. The influence of hydrogen on methanol engines has been studied by many researchers [19–25]. Gong et al [19] studied the influence of ignition timing on combustion and emissions of a SI methanol engine with added hydrogen under lean-burn conditions. It was found that at low engine speeds with various ignition timings, increasing hydrogen decreases indicated mean effective pressure, maximum cylinder pressure, maximum heat release rate, and combustion duration. While at high engine speeds with different ignition timings, more hydrogen increases the indicated mean effective pressure, maximum cylinder pressure, maximum heat release rate, and decreases the ignition delay, combustion duration. Two engines equipped with HPI+MPI and HPI+MDI were used to evaluate the lean-burn capability of SI engines by Gong et al [22]. It was found that H2 addition could also realize stable combustion under super lean-burn conditions for HPI+MDI engines. The BSHC and BSCO emissions of HPI+MPI engines were lower than those of HPI+MDI engines, but the BSNOX and soot emissions were higher. H2 addition decreases BSCO2 emissions at the same excess air ratio for both the HPI+MPI and HPI+MDI engines. A two-zone quasi-dimensional model was developed and validated for predicting the performance of a hydrogen-enriched methanol engine by Ji [23] et al, the validated model was applied to investigate the flame propagation speed, exhaust loss and brake thermal efficiency of hydrogen-enriched methanol engines. The influence of hydrogen on ethanol engines has been studied by many researchers [26–33]. Santos et al [26] studied the viability of pre-chamber system use in a commercial SI engine, considering combustion and emission analysis of both homogeneous and stratified with hydrogen injection pre-chamber systems. It was identified that the use of pre-chambers can reduce the combustion time by up to 20%, increase the thermal efficiency by up to 5% and reduce CO and NOx emissions by up to 12% and 33% respectively. Ayad et al [27] analyzed the performance parameters of an ethanol fueled SI engine operating with hydrogen enrichment, and it presents an experimental and numerical study of a turbocharged ethanol engine operating with hydrogen enrichment at stoichiometric conditions under boosted conditions. It was concluded that hydrogen addition allowed spark ignition engines to achieve lower brake specific energy consumption, better performance, and lower emissions. Senthil Kumar [29] et al explored the influence of hydrogen and ethanol on improving engine’s behavior of Maduca longifolia oil based dual fuel diesel engine, it was found that the performance could be improved by extending the knock limit by injecting ethanol and water along with hydrogen. The influence of hydrogen on methane engines has been studied by many researchers [34–46]. Huang et al [34] investigated the laminar flamecharacteristics of natural gas–hydrogen–air flames in aconstant-volumebomb at normal temperature and pressure. It was found that laminar burning velocities increased exponentially with the increase of hydrogen fraction in mixtures, while the Markstein length decreased and flame instability increased with the increase of hydrogen fractions in mixture.Huang et al [35] investigated the combustion characteristics of a direct-injection spark-ignited engine fueled with natural gas-hydrogen blends under various ignition timings and lean mixture condition. The results showed that the ignition timing had significant influence on engine performance, combustion and emissions.For specific ignition timing, the brake mean effective pressure and the effective thermal efficiency increase and combustion durations decreased with the increase of hydrogen fraction in natural gas. Exhaust HC concentration decreased and exhaust NOx concentration increased with advancing the ignition timing while the exhaust CO gives little variation under various ignition timings. Zheng et al [36] studied the combustion and emission characteristics of a spray guided direct-injection spark-ignition engine fueled with natural gas-hydrogen blends. It was found that the flame development duration, rapid combustion duration and total combustion duration decreased with increasing hydrogen fraction. Maximum cylinder gas pressure, maximum mean gas temperature, maximum rate of pressure rise and maximum heat release rate showed an increasing and then decreasing trend with the increase of hydrogen fraction. Brake NOx emission was increased and then decreased, while brake HC, CO and CO2 emissions decreased with the increase of hydrogen fraction. Kosmadakis et al [42] studied the NO, CO and HC emissions of methane/hydrogen in a SI engine based on a research CFD code. The results showed that the overall outcome was a numerical tool capable to predict with detail the in-cylinder processes and examine the local gas properties during flame propagation and pollutant emissions inside the combustion chamber for this case of high technological interest. Duan et al [43] studied the effects of various compression ratios and spark timing on performance and emission of a lean-burn heavy-duty spark ignition engine fueled with methane gas and hydrogen blends. It was found that The CO emission formation did not show a strong relationship with the hydrogen energy share and the CR. However, the CO2 emission gradually declined with increase of the percentage of hydrogen and CR. Catapano et al [45] investigated the energy efficiency of methane and hydrogen-methane blends in a PFI/DI SI research engine. It was found that for both the engine configurations, it was observed that the addition of hydrogen resulted in a more efficient combustion, even though the engine configuration played an important role. In PFI mode, the lower density of hydrogen caused a lower energy input. In DI mode, instead, the larger hydrogen diffusivity counteracted the charge stratification especially for larger hydrogen content. It can be found from the above discussion that there are many people who study separately on methanol-hydrogen blends, ethanol-hydrogen blends and methane-hydrogen blends. However, there are few comparative analyses on the combustion and emissions performance of methanol-hydrogen, ethanol-hydrogen and methane-hydrogen blends in a high compression ratio SI engine. There is a gap in the literature of both experimental and numerical studies considering hydrogen addition in a high compression ratio SI engine (using methanol-hydrogen, ethanol-hydrogen and methane-hydrogen blends). Therefore, in this study, the combustion and emission characteristics of methanol, ethanol and methane with different hydrogen volume ratios were carried out in a high compression ratio SI engine."
1,Testing and modeling,
2,Test engine,"2.1 Test engine The methanol engine of this experiment was modified from a conventional DI diesel engine with high compression ratio, four-cylinder and four-stroke. Due to the low cetane index of methanol and the high auto ignition temperature, it was difficult to be ignited by traditional compression ignition method. Therefore, the ignition mode of the engine of this experiment was changed from traditional compression ignition to spark ignition, and a spark plug was installed in each of the four cylinders of the engine Spark plug. The fuel injection method was changed from original in-cylinder direct injection to inlet injection, so it was necessary to install an injector in the intake port. The engine parameters were shown in Table 1 ."
3,Test fuel,"2.2 Test fuel The fuel used in this experiment was pure methanol. Methanol hadhigh octane index, therefore, a pure methanol-fueled engine had better knock resistance than an engine fueled with pure gasoline or methanol/gasoline. The physical and chemical properties of hydrogen, methanol, ethanol and methane were shown in Table 2 ."
4,Numerical model,"2.3 Numerical model There were complex gas flows in the engine cylinder, but no matter how complicated the gas flowed, it followed some basic conservation laws of nature, namely mass conservation, energy conservation, momentum conservation and component conservation law. By solving the conservation equation, the change of the basic physical quantity such as speed, temperature and concentration in the engine cylinder with time and space can be calculated. Finally, the physical quantity and the total average value of the transient flow field in the cylinder were calculated by RANS equation. The law of conservation of fluid was as follows: 2.3.1 Law of conservation of mass The law of conservation of mass was defined as: the mass of fluid flowing into the fluid micro-body per unit time, as the mass of the fluid micro-body inflow per unit time, equal to the net mass of the fluid micro-bodyat the same time. The mathematical expression was in the form: (1) ∂ ρ ∂ t + ∂ ρ u ρ x + ∂ ρ v ρ y + ∂ ρ w ∂ z = 0 where ρ was fluid density, t was time , u, v, and w were components of the velocity vector in the three directions of ×, y, and z, respectively. 2.3.2 Law of conservation of energy The law of conservation of energy was defined as the rate of increase of energy in the micro-body, equal to the sum of the net heat flux entering the micro-body and the work done by the surface force, body force on the micro-body. The mathematical expression of the energy conservation equation was in the form: (2) ∂ ρ T ∂ t + d i v ρ u T = d i v k c p g r a d T - ∂ ρ ∂ x + S T where cp was specific heat capacity, k was the heat transfer coefficient of the fluid, T was the temperature of the fluid, ST is the part of the fluid mechanical energy converted into thermal energy due to the viscous action of the fluid and the internal heat source of the fluid. 2.3.3 Law of conservation of momentum The law of conservation of momentum was defined as the rate of change of momentum in a fluid micro-body to time, was equvalent to the sum of the forces acting on the various external elements of the fluid micro -body. The mathematical expression was in the form: (3) ∂ ρ u ∂ t + d i v ρ u u = d i v μ g r a d u - ∂ p ∂ x + S u (4) ∂ ρ v ∂ t + d i v ρ v u = d i v μ g r a d v - ∂ p ∂ x + S v (5) ∂ ρ w ∂ t + d i v ρ w u = d i v μ g r a d w - ∂ p ∂ x + S w where μ was dynamic viscosity of fluid, p was the pressure on the fluid micro-body, Su , Sv and S w were the generalized source terms in the equation, respectively. 2.3.4 Law of species mass conservation Law of species mass conservation was defined as the rate of change in the quality of a chemical substance equal to the sum of the net diffusion flow rate through the cross section of the fluid and the generation rate of the component due to the chemical reaction. The mathematical expression was in the form: (6) ∂ ρ c s ∂ t + d i v ρ u c s = d i v D s g r a d ρ c s + S s Where Cs was the component concentration of S, Ds was the diffusion coefficient of the component, ρcs was the mass concentration of the component, Ss was the mass per unit volume generated by chemical reaction per unit time."
5,Engine model,"2.4 Engine model The methanol engine model used in this experiment was built by GT-Power simulation software. Models for almost all important engine conditions could be built by GT-Power which was one-dimensional simulation software based on fluid mechanics. Therefore, the GT-Power can simulate changes in the operating parameters of the engine under different operating conditions. The combustion model in GT-Power was divided into a non-predictive combustion model and a predicted combustion model. In this experiment, the predicted combustion model was used, and the relevant geometric parameters of the engine in Table 1 were input into the model, and different EGR rates and initial flame kernel are set to simulate the combustion situation in the cylinder. The engine simulation model mainly included the intake system, exhaust system, turbocharger system, ERG control system, etc. A methanol fuel depot has been added to improve the fuel supply model of the original engine based on the special physical and chemical properties of methanol. The engine model was shown in Fig. 1 ."
6,Modeling validation,"2.5 Modeling validation Before performing simulation calculations, it is necessary to verify the calculation model used to guarantee reliability of the simulation results. The model validation has been completed and validated in the previous study [6], and it could be used to simulate engine operation."
7,Fuel and operating conditions,"2.6 Fuel and operating conditions In this paper, the combustion and emission characteristics of hydrogen added to methanol, ethanol and methane engines are simulated by a 1-D model. The physical and chemical properties of methanol, ethanol, methane and hydrogen are shown in Table 2. The operation conditions of the simulation are shown in Table 3 . In this study, the excess air ratio is set to reflect the mixture of fuel and air, excess air ratios change for different fuels and hydrogen addition, shown in table 4 ."
8,Results and discussion,"Fig. 2 shows the power diagrams of the engine at the engine load of 10% and 30%, respectively. As can be seen from the figure, when the engine load is 10%, as the hydrogen ratio increases, the engine power is gradually increase. This is because with the addition of hydrogen, the volumetric efficiency and flame propagation speed of the engine increase, which results in an increase in engine power. For the methanol/hydrogen and ethanol/hydrogen blends, when the engine load is 30%, as the hydrogen ratio increases, the engine power is gradually decrease. This may be because, as the proportion of hydrogen increases, the excess air ratios of methanol and ethanol decrease, and the excess air ratios of methane increase (shown in table 4). Reduction of excess air ratio may lead to incomplete combustion of fuel. However, the methane/hydrogen blends is gradually increase. Under the same ratio of hydrogenation, the engine power of methanol-hydrogen blend is higher than ethanol/hydrogen and methane/hydrogen at the 10% and 30% engine load, and the power of methane/hydrogen is lower than methanol/hydrogen and ethanol/hydrogen blends. This is due to the slow combustion rate of methane and poor lean-burn capability [47]. BSFC is one of the important evaluation index of engine fuel economical characteristics. Fig. 3 shows the BSFC diagrams of the engine at the engine load of 10% and 30%, respectively. As can be seen from the figure, when the engine load is 10% and 30%, as the hydrogen ratio increases, the BSFC of the engine is gradually decreased. Under the same ratio of hydrogenation, the BSFC of methanol-hydrogen blend is higher than ethanol/hydrogen and methane/hydrogen at the 10% and 30% engine load, and the BSFC of methane/hydrogen is lower than methanol/hydrogen and ethanol/hydrogen blends. Fig. 4 shows the Pmax and CAMP diagrams of the engine at the engine load of 10% and 30%, respectively. As can be seen from the figure, when the engine load is 10%, as the hydrogen ratio increases, the Pmax of the engine is first decrease, and then increase, the minimum is at 3% hydrogen addition. This may be due to the small amount of hydrogen added, and the addition of hydrogen fuel in the rich gas mixture zone leads to a lack of oxygen, which eventually leads to incomplete combustion of the fuel. When the engine load is 30%, as the hydrogen ratio increases, the Pmax of the engine is gradually decreased. Under the same ratio of hydrogenation, the Pmax of methanol-hydrogen blend is higher than ethanol/hydrogen and methane/hydrogen at the 10% and 30% engine load, and the Pmax of methane/hydrogen is lower than methanol/hydrogen and ethanol/hydrogen blends. As can be seen from the figure, when the engine load is 10%, as the hydrogen ratio increases, there is a tendency to delay on the CAMP of the in-cylinder. Fig. 5 shows the MHRR and CAMR diagrams of the engine at the engine load of 10% and 30%, respectively. As the hydrogen ratio increases, there is a declining trend on the MHRR. Under the same ratio of hydrogenation, the MHRR of methanol-hydrogen blend is higher than ethanol/hydrogen and methane/hydrogen at the 10% and 30% engine load, and the MHRR of methane/hydrogen is lower than methanol/hydrogen and ethanol/hydrogen blends. As the hydrogen addition, there is a tendency to delay on CAMR. Fig. 6 shows the ignition delay results of the engine at the engine load of 10% and 30%, respectively. It can be seen that as the hydrogen addition, the ignition delay was extended. When the engine load is 10%, as the proportion of hydrogen increases, the excess air ratio decreases. Insufficient air in the mixture may cause longer ignition delay. When the engine load is 30%, as the proportion of hydrogen increases, the excess air ratio of methanol and ethanol increase. The reason for the increase in ignition delay time could be that the lack of oxygen increase with the increase of hydrogen supplement rate in the rich mixture zone, this is not conducive to the formation and development of theflame nucleus. Under the same ratio of hydrogenation, the ignition delay of methane/hydrogen is longer than methanol/hydrogen and ethanol/hydrogen blends. The ignition delay of methanol/hydrogen and ethanol/hydrogen blends is basically the same. This may be due to the excess air ratio of methane being greater than that of methanol and ethanol during the actual combustion cycle. Fig. 7 shows the combustion duration results of the engine at the engine load of 10% and 30%, respectively. It can be seen that as the hydrogen addition, the combustion duration was extended. Under the same ratio of hydrogenation, the combustion duration of methane/hydrogen is longer than methanol/hydrogen and ethanol/hydrogen blends. The ignition delay of methanol/hydrogen and ethanol/hydrogen blends is basically close. Fig. 8 (a) and (b) show the HC emissions diagrams of the 10% engine load and 30% engine load, respectively. As can be seen from the figure, when the engine load is 10% and 30%, as the hydrogen ratio increases, the HC emissions of the engine are decreased, the methanol/hydrogen is higher than the ethanol/hydrogen and methane/hydrogen blends. Methane/hydrogen blends has the lowest HC emissions. This may be due to the behavior of wide flammable limits and rapid hydrogen flame propagation improve the combustion, resulting in the reduction in HC emissions. As the excess air ratio of methane is the largest in the actual combustion process, the combustion is the most sufficient, and the HC emission is the smallest. Fig. 9 (a) and (b) show the NOx emissions diagrams of the 10% engine load and 30% engine load, respectively. As can be seen from the figure, when the engine load is 10% and 30%, for all three fuels, as the hydrogen ratio increases, the NOx emissions first decrease and then increase, the minimum is at 3% hydrogen addition. This may be due to the small amount of hydrogen added, and the addition of hydrogen fuel in the rich gas mixture zone leads to a lack of oxygen, which eventually leads to incomplete combustion of the fuel. As the proportion of hydrogen increases further, as the flame temperature of hydrogen is higher than that of methanol, ethanol, and methane, the emissions of B increase. When hydrogen is not added, because the heat value of methane is the highest, the NOx emissions from methane combustion are the most. With the increase of hydrogen ratio, the NOx emission of methane/hydrogen is lower than the ethanol/hydrogen and methanol/hydrogen blends. The NOx emission of methanol/hydrogen is higher than the methane/hydrogen and ethanol/hydrogen blends. CO emissions are mainly caused by insufficient combustion of the mixed gas. Fig. 10 (a) and (b) show the CO emissions diagrams of the 10% engine load and 30% engine load, respectively. As can be seen from the figure, when the engine load is 10% and 30%, as the hydrogen ratio increases, the CO emissions of the methanol/hydrogen, methane/hydrogen and ethanol/hydrogen blends are gradually decreased. This is because the increase in the proportion of hydrogen reduces the proportion of carbon in the fuel and the flame propagation speed increases. The CO emission of methane/hydrogen is lower than the ethanol/hydrogen and methane/hydrogen blends. This is due to the highest proportion of carbon in the molecular formula of ethanol. Fig. 11 (a) and (b) show the CO2 emissions diagrams of the 10% engine load and 30% engine load, respectively. As can be seen from the figure, when the engine load is 10% and 30%, as the hydrogen ratio increases, the CO2 emissions of the methanol/hydrogen, methane/hydrogen and ethanol/hydrogen blends are gradually decreased. Because the proportion of carbon in the molecular formula of ethanol is the highest, the CO2 emission of ethanol/hydrogen is higher than the methanol/hydrogen and methane/hydrogen blends."
9,Conclusion,"Hydrogen is recognized as a clean energy source. In this study, the influence of low proportion of hydrogen on the performance of a SI engine is studied by GT-Power simulation platform. The comparative study on combustion and emission characteristics of methanol/hydrogen, ethanol/hydrogen and methane/hydrogen blends in high compression ratio SI engine has been studied in this paper. Through the analysis of the above results, conclusions can be summarized as follows: (1) Under the same ratio of hydrogenation, the engine power of methanol-hydrogen blend is higher than ethanol/hydrogen and methane/hydrogen at the 10% and 30% engine load. (2) Under the same ratio of hydrogenation, the BSFC of methanol-hydrogen blend is higher than ethanol/hydrogen and methane/hydrogen at the 10% and 30% engine load, and the BSFC of methane/hydrogen is lower than methanol/hydrogen and ethanol/hydrogen blends. (3) As the hydrogen addition, the ignition delay and the combustion duration were extended. Under the same ratio of hydrogenation, the ignition delay and combustion duration of methane/hydrogen are longer than methanol/hydrogen and ethanol/hydrogen blends. (4) As the hydrogen ratio increases, the HC emissions of the engine are decreased. Under the same ratio of hydrogenation, the methanol/hydrogen is higher than the ethanol/hydrogen and methane/hydrogen blends. The HC emission of methane/hydrogen is lower than methanol/hydrogen and ethanol/hydrogen blends. (5) As the hydrogen ratio increases, the NOx emissions of the engine are increased. When hydrogen is not added, the NOx emissions from methane combustion are the most. With the increase of hydrogen ratio, the NOx emission of methane/hydrogen is lower than the ethanol/hydrogen and methanol/hydrogen blends. The NOx emission of methanol/hydrogen is higher than the methane/hydrogen and ethanol/hydrogen blends. (6) As can be seen from the figure, when the engine load is 10% and 30%, as the hydrogen ratio increases, the CO emissions of the methanol/hydrogen, methane/hydrogen and ethanol/hydrogen blends are gradually decreased. The CO emissions of methanol/hydrogen and methane/hydrogen blends are lower than the ethanol/hydrogen blends. (7) As the hydrogen ratio increases, the CO2 emissions of the methanol/hydrogen, methane/hydrogen and ethanol/hydrogen blends are gradually decreased. The CO2 emissions of methanol/hydrogen and methane/hydrogen are lower than the ethanol/hydrogen blends. In short, at present, it is difficult to add a large proportion of hydrogen to other hydrocarbon fuels or use pure hydrogen as a fuel. However, it is easier to add a low proportion of hydrogen (within 10% volume) to the methanol, ethanol and methane engines, and improve the performance of the engine. In the future, if hydrogen can be produced at low cost and there are good and safe ways to store and transport hydrogen, it will promote the development of energy and IC engines and reduce the troubles caused by environmental problems."
