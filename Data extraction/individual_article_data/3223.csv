0,Introduction,"Methane is the most abundant reduced compound in the atmosphere and plays an important role in the carbon cycle (Dean et al., 2018). In addition, methane is a powerful greenhouse gas trapping 28 times more heat per mass unit than carbon dioxide (Myhre et al., 2014). Aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria, or methanotrophs, are crucial players in the global cycle of methane. They can attenuate methane emissions from major sources and constitute the only biological sink for atmospheric methane from terrestrial environments (Cai et al., 2016; Conrad, 1996; Kolb et al., 2005; Tveit et al., 2019). Methanotrophs can be found in three bacterial phyla: Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and NC10. The best-studied known methanotrophs belong to the phylum Proteobacteria. Proteobacterial methanotrophs have been detected in a wide range of environments such as rice paddies, various upland and hydromorphic soils, landfills, and peatlands (Conrad, 2007; Hanson and Hanson, 1996; Knief, 2015; Semrau et al., 2010). Based on phylogenetic, morphological and physiological characteristics, the proteobacterial methanotrophs are historically divided into type I and type II methanotrophs (Gamma- and Alphaproteobacteria, respectively (Bowman, 2006; Trotsenko and Murrell, 2008; Whittenbury and Dalton, 1981)). The methanotrophic Alphaproteobacteria were recently divided into type IIa (Methylocystaceae) and type IIb (Beijerinck iaceae) (Knief, 2015). Proteobacterial methanotrophs use methane as their sole source of carbon and energy. The primary step that differentiates methanotrophs from other methylotrophs is the oxidation of methane by the particulate and/or soluble methane monooxygenases (Murrell et al., 2000a, 2000b). Formaldehyde is generated as the central intermediate by the consecutive oxidation of methane and methanol. Formaldehyde is either assimilated via the serine or ribulose monophosphate pathway into cell carbon or further oxidized to formate and carbon dioxide to gain energy for growth (Chidambarampadmavathy et al., 2015; Karthikeyan et al., 2015; Semrau et al., 2010). Even though methanotrophs have been studied for many years, major gaps still exist in the fundamental knowledge of this important microbial group, making them underrepresented in metabolic engineering strategies (Kalyuzhnaya et al., 2015). It is widely assumed that utilization of methane is the primary growth strategy of the methanotrophs; however, little is known about how methanotrophic bacteria adapt to changes in environmental factors such as CH4 and/or O2 limitation or the availability of putative alternative electron donors (e.g., methanol, hydrogen, or multi-carbon organic compounds). In particular, this is true on the molecular level, including their transcriptome and proteome. These gaps in our knowledge make it difficult to create useful metabolic models or predict key targets for metabolic engineering of methanotrophs (Akberdin et al., 2018; Farhan Ul Haque et al., 2017; He et al., 2019; Kalyuzhnaya et al., 2015; Nguyen et al., 2020). Nonetheless, the biotechnological potential of type IIa methanotrophs has been broadly discussed (Dalton, 1983; Fei et al., 2014; Murrell and Smith, 2009; Trotsenko and Murrell, 2008), but to date only a few methane-based products are made on pilot or commercial scale. Among these is the production of methanotrophic single cell protein (SCP), done in UK (“BioProtein” (Nofferm/Calysta)), Norway and Denmark (“Uniprotein” (Unibio A/S)), and the former USSR (“Gaprin”). However, SCP production does not involve the use of metabolically engineered strains (Kalyuzhnaya et al., 2015). In addition, several studies have shown that type IIa methanotrophs of the Methylocystis and Methylosinus genera represent a potential source of bioplastics due to their production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) under nutrient-limited conditions (Bordel et al., 2019b; Cantera et al., 2019). In these methanotrophs, acetyl-CoA produced in the serine cycle is transformed into PHAs via the sequential enzymatic activity of β-ketothiolase (phaA), acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (phaB), and PHA synthase (phaC) (Cantera et al., 2019). Methylocystis and Methylosinus cells can accumulate a PHA content ranging from 20 to 60% (Lopez et al., 2018; Pieja et al., 2011, 2017; Rostkowski et al., 2013). Recent pure culture studies have provided evidence that alphapoteobacterial methanotrophs are indeed metabolically more versatile than previously thought (Belova et al., 2011; Bordel et al., 2019a, 2019b; Cantera et al., 2019; Dedysh and Dunfield, 2011; Dedysh et al., 2005; Dunfield et al., 2010; Im et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2013). Thus, these bacteria offer a number of metabolic properties for specific biotechnological applications. Contrary to the long-held paradigm that methanotrophs are obligate methylotrophs, species from three alphaproteobacterial genera have been shown to grow on simple organic acids, alcohols and short-chain alkane gases (Belova et al., 2011; Crombie and Murrell, 2014; Dedysh et al., 2005; Im et al., 2011). More recently, alphaproteobacterial methanotrophs have also been shown to contain genes encoding different types of [NiFe]-hydrogenases (Carere et al., 2017; Greening et al., 2016). These organisms are widely distributed in diverse habitats (in particular Methylocystis spp.), but most frequently in oxic-anoxic interfaces of methanogenic environments with counter gradients of oxygen, methane and hydrogen (Brune et al., 2000; Piche-Choquette and Constant, 2019; Piche-Choquette et al., 2018). Thus, it was assumed that in addition to organic compounds, they are capable of using hydrogen (H2) as an alternative source of energy in the so-called “K nallgas ” reaction (Eberhardt, 1969). The key enzymes involved in hydrogen metabolism are hydrogenases that channel electrons from hydrogen into the quinone pool, thereby providing the link between hydrogen oxidation and energy production (Piche-Choquette and Constant, 2019). The most abundant hydrogenases, including those responsible for aerobic hydrogen oxidation, contain a [NiFe] active site (Shafaat et al., 2013). Utilization of H2 as an alternative energy source may be an effective strategy to enhance biomass yield in metabolic engineering of type IIa methanotrophs. Nowadays, most efforts to metabolically engineer type IIa methanotrophs are focused on well characterized species, such as Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, and on Methylocystis spp. The latter organisms are known to be both most oligotrophic and most widespread in terrestrial environments (Chen et al., 2007; Dedysh et al., 2003; Knief et al., 2003; Nauer et al., 2012). Our model organism, strain SC2, is one of the very few Methylocystis spp. with a well-annotated gap-closured genome sequence (Dam et al., 2012). Among other genes of interest (e.g., Baani and Liesack, 2008), Methylocystis sp. strain SC2 was shown to possess genes encoding four different groups of [NiFe]-hydrogenases: Group 1d, Group 1h/5, Group 2b, and Group 3b. Therefore, it is a suitable model organism to study the multifaceted role of H2 metabolism for the improvement of metabolic engineering strategies of type IIa methanotrophs. The objective of our study was to assess whether strain SC2, as a representative of Methylocystis spp., can utilize hydrogen to optimize its biomass yield by mixed utilization of CH4 and H2, rather than CH4 as the sole source of energy. Thus, we aimed to show that, in the presence of H2, CH4 will primarily be used for synthesis of cell carbon and increase in biomass/protein yield. In particular, we intended to explore those CH4/O2 ratios, which maximize the effect of hydrogen addition on the biomass yield and proteome of strain SC2. To achieve our goals, we combined hydrogen-based growth experiments with our recently optimized proteomics workflow (Hakobyan et al., 2018)."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Initial growth experiments with hydrogen,"2.1 Initial growth experiments with hydrogen Cells of Methylocystis sp. strain SC2 were pre-grown to the exponential phase (OD600 = 0.2 ± 0.05) in 120-ml serum bottles containing 30 ml of nitrate-based mineral salts medium (NMS) with the same basic composition as reported earlier (Dam et al., 2014; Heyer et al., 2002). One gram of KNO3 (~10 mM NO3 −) per liter was added to the medium as the nitrogen source. The headspace was filled with air and filter-sterilized methane (air/CH4 ratio of 80/20%, v/v). The serum bottles were incubated on a rotary shaker at 130 rpm and 25 °C for 48–72 h. Next, the SC2 cells were collected by centrifugation (7000×g for 20 min, 4 °C) and thoroughly washed twice with phosphate buffer saline (1 × PBS, pH 7.4). The washed cells were used to investigate the influence of H2 on biomass yield and CH4 consumption under CH4/O2-replete and CH4/O2-limiting conditions. The hydrogen treatments were done using the same cultural conditions as described above, but with adjusted headspace. The headspace was filled with five different CH4/O2 ratios (Experimental Sets I to V in Fig. 1 ), with and without the addition of 2% H2, and finally balanced with helium (He). The effect of different H2 concentrations on strain SC2 growth was determined in Set IV with the addition of 0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 5% H2. Cultures without H2 addition were used as a control. All cultures were incubated for a total of 96 h. The cell density was monitored by measuring the turbidity at 600 nm (OD600) using Eppendorf Biophotometer UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Eppendorf, Germany). Changes in the headspace CH4 and CO2 concentrations were monitored over time using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID, SRI Instruments, Earl St. Torrance, CA). Hydrogen utilization by strain SC2 was measured using a H2 microsensor with piercing needle (Unisense A/S, Denmark). The oxygen consumption was monitored using a Presens Fibox 4 trace meter with SP-PSt-3 (broad range) O2 spot sensors for culture sets with elevated O2 concentrations (Set I, Set III, and Set V) and SP-PSt-6 (trace oxygen) O2 spot sensors for culture sets with limited O2 concentrations (Set II and Set IV). The calibration of the sensor spots was performed using barcodes provided by the manufacturer (PreSens Precision Sensing GmbH, Regensburg, Germany)."
3,Determination of cell dry weight per OD600,"2.2 Determination of cell dry weight per OD600 Biomass expressed as cell dry weight (CDW) was used to calculate the growth rate and specific gas consumption rate of strain SC2. In order to determine the CDW per OD600, SC2 cells were pre-incubated in NMS under standard conditions and harvested in the exponential growth phase. After incubation, the culture was subjected to centrifugation (7000×g for 30 min, 4 °C) and the pelleted SC2 cells were washed twice with PBS. The washed cells were dried for 24 h at 100 °C, and the CDW was determined. An OD600 of 1 corresponded to 0.26 (±0.01) g CDW/L of strain SC2 culture. Biomass yield was expressed as mg CDW per mmol CH4 consumed. Methane consumption rate was indicated as mmol CH4 consumed per g CDW per day. Hydrogen consumption rate was shown as mmol H2 consumed per g CDW per day."
4,Sampling and extraction of intracellular and excreted metabolites,"2.3 Sampling and extraction of intracellular and excreted metabolites In order to measure intracellular energy metabolites (ATP/NADH) and excreted fermentation products, SC2 cells pre-grown to the mid-exponential phase were incubated under a headspace of 6% CH4 and 3% O2 with and without the addition of 2% H2. Cultures of Set I (20% CH4; 15% O2) without the addition of H2 were used to compare the amount of excreted fermentation products between high CH4/high O2 and substrate-limited conditions (6% CH4; 3% O2). The incubations were done in a fed-batch cultivation regime for a total of two weeks, with shaking (130 rpm) at 25 °C. The headspace of the cultures was readjusted to the starting concentrations of CH4/O2/H2 every three days to ensure the continuous supply of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. The samples for measurement of the intracellular metabolites were collected from SC2 cultures at the end of the incubation period by a sequential quenching-extraction approach. Culture aliquots (12 ml) were pipetted into 36 ml of 60% (v/v) ice-cold methanol (−60 °C) used as a quenching solution. Quenched cells were immediately pelleted by centrifugation (10 min, −10 °C, 10,000×g), and the supernatant was discarded. Cell pellets were stored at −80 °C until further extraction. Intracellular metabolites were extracted by suspending the cell pellet in equal volumes of extraction fluid [50% (v/v) methanol, 50% (v/v) TE buffer [10 mM TRIZMA (pH 7.0), 1 mM EDTA]; −20 °C] and 100% chloroform (−20 °C). The volume of extraction fluid and chloroform added to each cell pellet depended on cell biomass and equaled 0.7 ml per OD600 of 1. The resulting suspension was incubated at 1 °C for 2 h in a ThermoMixer C shaker (Eppendorf) with maximum shaking (2000 rpm). Subsequently, the samples were centrifuged at −10 °C for 10 min (10,000×g). The upper phase of the two-phase system was filtered (0.22 μm, PTFE, 4 mm diameter (Phenomenex, CA, USA)) and stored at −80 °C until further analysis. The samples (1 ml) for measurement of excreted fermentation products were collected at the beginning and the end of the two-week incubation period. The samples were filtered through 0.22 μm HPLC/GC approved RC membrane filters (Phenomenex) into 2 ml sterile safe-lock microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf) and stored at −80 °C for further use."
5,Analysis and quantification of intracellular and excreted metabolites,"2.4 Analysis and quantification of intracellular and excreted metabolites Detection and quantification of intracellular metabolites were performed using LC-MS/MS. The chromatographic separation was performed on an Agilent Infinity II 1290 HPLC system using a SeQuant ZIC-HILIC column (150 × 2.1 mm; 3.5 μm, 100 Å (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany)) equipped with a 20 × 2.1 mm guard column of the same specifications (Merck, Germany). The separation was done at a constant flow rate of 0.4 ml/min with 20 mM ammonium acetate adjusted to pH 9.2 (by ammonium hydroxide) as phase A and acetonitrile as phase B. The injection volume was 5 μl. The mobile phase profile consisted of the following steps and linear gradients: 0–1 min from 20% B to 25% B; 1–4 min from 25 to 35% B; 4–5 min from 35 to 80% B; 5–6 min constant at 80% B; 6–7 min from 80 to 20% B; 7–8 min constant at 20% B. Acetate, lactate, succinate, and 3-hydroxybutyrate were analyzed according to Han et al. (2013), with minor modifications. Stock solutions of 150 mM 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide in methanol, 250 mM 3-nitrophenyl-hydrazine hydrochloride in 50% methanol, and 7.5% pyridine in 75% methanol were prepared separately, mixed in equal volumes, and used as a master mix. Aliquots (30 μl) of sample/standard were added to 90 μl of the master mix, mixed by vortexing, and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The analysis was performed on an Agilent Infinity II 1290 HPLC system using a reversed phase column (Kinetex EVO C18, 50 × 2.1 mm; 1.7 μm, 100 Å, Phenomenex) equipped with a 20 × 2.1 mm guard column of similar specificity. The separation was done at a constant flow rate of 0.25 ml/min with mobile phase A being 0.1% formic acid in water and phase B being 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The injection volume was 5 μl. The mobile phase profile consisted of the following steps and linear gradients: 0–1 min constant at 5% B; 1–5 min from 5 to 95% B; 5–5.5 min constant at 95% B; 5.5–6 min from 95 to 5% B; 6–7 min constant at 5% B. Both intracellular and excreted metabolites were analyzed using an Agilent 6495 ion funnel mass spectrometer in a negative mode and equipped with an electrospray ionization source. The following conditions were used for the analysis of intracellular metabolites: ESI spray voltage of 3500 V, sheath gas of 350 °C at 11 L/min, nebulizer pressure of 20 psig, and drying gas of 225 °C at 14 L/min. Excreted metabolites were analyzed using the following conditions: ESI spray voltage of 3000 V, sheath gas of 400 °C at 12 L/min, nebulizer pressure of 25 psig, and drying gas of 130 °C at 11 L/min. Based on mass transition and retention time, the intracellular and excreted metabolites were identified in comparison to internal standards. Extracted ion chromatograms of the [M-H] - forms were integrated using MassHunter software (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Absolute concentrations were calculated based on an external calibration curve using uniformly labeled 13C-succinate as an internal standard."
6,Long-term fed-batch cultivation for proteomics and transcript analysis,"2.5 Long-term fed-batch cultivation for proteomics and transcript analysis In order to collect biomass for proteomics and RNA extraction, cells of strain SC2 were pre-grown to mid-exponential phase using standard conditions as described above (air/CH4 ratio of 80/20%, v/v). Following, cells in the logarithmic growth phase were collected, washed and used for the H2 treatments. The washed cells were incubated under a headspace of 6% CH4, 3% O2, 2% H2, and 89% He. SC2 cultures without the addition of H2 were used as a control. Biomass for proteomics and RNA extraction were collected after an incubation period of 19 h, 10 d, and 37 d in fed-batch cultivation mode. The headspace of the 10-day and 37-day cultures were re-adjusted to the starting concentrations of CH4/O2/H2 every three to four days to ensure the continuous supply of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. Finally, the cells of all the H2 and control treatments were collected by centrifugation (7000×g for 20 min, 4 °C) and thoroughly washed twice with PBS buffer to remove traces of the growth medium. The cells (50 ± 10 mg) were pelleted in 2 ml sterile safe-lock microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf) and stored at −80 °C for further use."
7,"Extraction, solubilization and digestion of proteins","2.6 Extraction, solubilization and digestion of proteins The proteomics sample preparation was done according to a previous study (Hakobyan et al., 2018). In brief, the frozen cell pellets were resuspended and sonicated (Hielscher Ultrasound Technology, Germany) in 2% sodium deoxycholate buffer (SDC, dissolved in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate) in the presence of 5 mM tris[2-carboxyethyl]phosphine and subsequently incubated at 95 °C for 60 min. The samples were subjected to additional 20 s rounds of sonication after 15 and 30 min of incubation. After the SDC treatment, all the protein samples were allowed to cool followed by an incubation with 10 mM iodoacetamide at 25 °C for 30 min. The resulting crude lysates were used for further digestion as described below. The concentration of proteins in each sample was measured with BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For protein digestion step, 50 μg of total solubilized protein from crude lysate samples was used. For in-solution digestion, the samples were diluted to 0.5% of solubilizing (SDC) agent in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer. LysC (0.5 μg, Wako Chemicals GmbH) was added directly to the protein extract. The extract was incubated for 4 h at 30 °C, followed by trypsin (1 μg, Promega) digestion overnight at 30 °C. Before LC-MS analysis, traces of SDC were precipitated using 2% trifluoroacetic acid, and all protein digests were desalted using C18 microspin columns (Harvard Apparatus, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions."
8,"LC-MS/MS analyses, peptide/protein identification and LFQ quantification","2.7 LC-MS/MS analyses, peptide/protein identification and LFQ quantification The LC-MS/MS analysis of protein digests was performed on a Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer connected to an electrospray ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptide separation was carried out using the Ultimate 3000 nanoLC-system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), equipped with an in-house packed C18 resin column (Magic C18 AQ 2.4 μm, Dr. Maisch). The peptides were first loaded onto a C18 precolumn (preconcentration set-up) and then eluted in backflush mode using a gradient from 96% solvent A (0.15% formic acid) and 4% solvent B (99.85% acetonitrile, 0.15% formic acid) to 30% solvent B over 115 min. The flow rate was set to 300 nL/min. The data acquisition mode for the initial LFQ study was set to obtain one high-resolution MS scan at a resolution of 60,000 (m/z 200) with a scanning range from 375 to 1500 m/z followed by MS/MS scans of the 10 most intense ions. To increase the efficiency of MS/MS acquisition, the charged state screening modus was activated to exclude unassigned and singly charged ions. The dynamic exclusion duration was set to 30 s. The ion accumulation time was set to 50 ms (both MS and MS/MS). The automatic gain control (AGC) was set to 3 × 106 for MS survey scans and 1 × 105 for MS/MS scans. Discovery-LFQ was done using Progenesis QI software (Nonlinear Dynamics, version 2.0) as discussed before (for details see (Hakobyan et al., 2018)). Next, the data obtained from Progenesis were evaluated using SafeQuant R package, version 2.2.2 (Glatter et al., 2012). Hereby, 1% identification and quantification false discovery rate (FDR) were calculated."
9,Prediction of protein-protein interactions,"2.8 Prediction of protein-protein interactions Prediction of protein-protein interactions was conducted with the online analysis tool STRING version 11 (Szklarczyk et al., 2019). The predicted network was grouped into five clusters by “kmeans clustering” filter. The network edges were analyzed based on molecular action, where the line shape indicates the predicted mode of action. The thickness of each edge indicates the confidence of interaction (0–1.0)."
10,Effect of chemical inhibitors on SC2 growth,"2.9 Effect of chemical inhibitors on SC2 growth In order to assess the effect of catechol alone and a mixture of metronidazole and catechol on SC2 growth under H2 treatment, cells of strain SC2 were pre-grown to the mid-exponential phase using standard conditions (NMS, air/CH4 ratio of 80/20%, v/v). The mid-log phase cells were collected, washed and incubated under a headspace of 6% CH4, 3% O2, and 89% He with and without the addition of 2% H2 in a strict batch cultivation regime. Triplicate cultures were then treated with (i) no chemical inhibitors, (ii) 0.4 mM catechol in water, or (iii) 0.4 mM catechol in water and 2 mM metronidazole in DMSO. The changes in cell density and H2 consumption were monitored over a one-week period as described in above (section 2.1)."
11,RNA extraction,"2.10 RNA extraction Total RNA was extracted from frozen cell pellets of both H2 and control treatments using the RiboPureTM-Bacteria Kit (Ambion, Life Technologies, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, but with slight modifications. In order to increase the yield of total RNA, the RiboPureTM-Bacteria Kit reagents used for binding and elution of the RNA extract were replaced with those of the RNA Clean and ConcentratorTM-5 Kit (Zymo Research, CA, USA). The purified RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Ambion) and quantified by Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific)."
12,Real-time quantitative PCR and primer design,"2.11 Real-time quantitative PCR and primer design A total of eight genes were selected for real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), in order to validate the differential regulation of methane, nitrogen and hydrogen metabolism-related proteins between the experimental treatments on the transcriptome level. These genes encode the large subunits of Group 1d (hupB), Group 1h/5 (hhyL), Group 2b (hupV) and Group 3b (hyhL) hydrogenases and nifH (nitrogenase), pmoA1 (pMMO1) and pmoA2 (pMMO2). In addition, the rplI gene encoding 50S ribosomal protein L9 was used as a reference in RT-qPCR. Total RNA was reverse transcribed using the GoScriptTM Reverse Transcription System (Promega, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Random primers (0.5 μg/reaction) provided by the kit were used to produce single-stranded cDNA. A serial dilution series of cDNA (1:10 and 1:50) was used to quantify the mRNA transcript copy numbers of each target gene. Total DNA of strain SC2 was extracted using the GeneEluteTM Bacterial Genomic DNA Kit (Merck, Germany). Standard curves were constructed using genomic DNA from strain SC2 as the template (calibration range from 1 to 107 copies, based on Applied Biosystems protocols). The primers used for RT-qPCR (Table S-1) were designed with the NCBI Primer design tool using Primer 3 settings as suggested previously (Thornton and Basu, 2011). Specificity and secondary structures of the newly designed primers were checked by Beacon DesignerTM free edition (Premier Biosoft International). RT-qPCR was performed using the SYBR® Green JumpStartTM Taq ReadyMixTM (Merck, Germany) on a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR system (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., CA, USA). All reactions were carried out in three biological and three technical replicates for each H2 and control treatment (total of nine RT-qPCR reactions for each treatment and time point). The PCR efficiency was at least 80% (R2 > 0.90). The presence of unspecific products was checked by melt curve analysis. Statistical analysis of the RT-qPCR data was conducted in SigmaPlot 14. Significance (p-value) for the differential regulation of transcripts between H2-treated and control samples was calculated. Each data set was checked for normal distribution using Shapiro-Wilk normality test. For the data sets that passed the normality test (p > 0.050), Student's t-test was computed. While for the data sets that failed the normality test (p < 0.050), Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test was applied. The differential expression of transcripts with log2-fold change of >1 or < -1 and p-value of ≤0.01 was considered significant."
13,Raw files and associated data deposition,"2.12 Raw files and associated data deposition The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE (Vizcaino et al., 2016) partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD015700 and 10.6019/PXD015700."

15,Impact of the CH4/O2 ratio on H2 utilization by strain SC2,"3.1 Impact of the CH4/O2 ratio on H2 utilization by strain SC2 To determine the impact of H2 addition on the growth of strain SC2 under CH4 and/or O2 limited conditions, SC2 cells were incubated with five different CH4/O2 headspace ratios under nitrogen-free conditions (Fig. 1). Cell density (OD600) and the concentrations of CH4 and H2 were regularly measured during the one-week (187 h) incubation period. SC2 cultures with H2 in the headspace demonstrated significantly higher growth during the first 70 h of incubation under O2-limited (3%) conditions than those without H2 (Fig. 2 A and Fig. S-1). This time period included both the exponential growth phase and the transition to the early stationary phase. The positive growth effect of H2 under O2-limited conditions was significant regardless of whether 6% CH4 (Set IV) or 20% CH4 (Set II) had been added to the headspace. Hydrogen-treated cultures of all five experimental sets showed the ability to oxidize 2% H2 that had been added to the headspace (Fig. 2B and Fig. S-1). However, H2 utilization was much faster in the cultures with limited O2 (3%, Sets II and IV) than with elevated O2 concentrations. Hydrogen was almost fully consumed after 70 h and 160 h in cultures of Set IV (Fig. 2B) and Set II (Fig. S-1), respectively. In Set V, H2 was almost fully consumed after 180 h of incubation (Fig. S-1). In Sets I and III, H2 had not been fully consumed even after the complete incubation period of 187 h (Fig. S-1). Concurrently, in all culture sets except Set III, O2 was almost fully consumed after the first 70 h of incubation (Fig. 2C and Fig. S-2). In O2-limited cultures (Set II and Set IV), O2 was consumed faster in the H2-treated cultures than in control cultures. In Set III, only half of the available O2 was consumed throughout the whole incubation period of 187 h, while CH4 was almost completely consumed already after 70 h of incubation (Fig. S-2). By contrast, in all other experimental treatments (Sets I, II, IV, and V), CH4 was not completely consumed in both H2-treated and control cultures within 187 h (Fig. 2D and Fig. S-2). Based on the CH4, H2 and O2 consumption measurements (Fig. 2, Fig. S-1 and Fig. S-2), we calculated cell dry weight, biomass yield, specific consumption rates (CH4, H2, and O2), and O2/CH4 uptake ratios of the early-stationary cultures (70 h) (Fig. 3 and Table S-2). The addition of H2 under O2-limited conditions significantly increased the biomass yield (Fig. 3A) but decreased the CH4 consumption rate of strain SC2 (Fig. 3B). The differences in biomass yield and CH4 consumption rate between control and H2 treatment were clearly more pronounced in cultures of Set IV (6% CH4) than in those of Set II (20% CH4). Relative to the controls, biomass yield in SC2 cultures of Set IV was increased by more than two-fold after 70 h of incubation (Fig. 3A), while the CH4 consumption rate was decreased by half (Fig. 3B and Table S-2). No effects of H2 addition on the growth activity of strain SC2 were observed under O2 replete (9% and 15% O2) conditions (Fig. 3 and Table S-2). Furthermore, cultures of Set IV demonstrated the highest H2 consumption rate among all the experimental sets (Table S-2). Our CH4 and O2 measurements across all five experimental sets revealed that the O2/CH4 uptake ratio decreased with increasing CH4/O2 headspace ratio at culture start (Fig. 3C and Table S-2). In fact, SC2 cultures of Set III demonstrated the highest O2/CH4 uptake ratio of 1.5–1.7 (Table S-2). By contrast, SC2 cultures of Set II and Set IV showed, relative to Set III, a sharply decreased O2/CH4 uptake ratio of 0.5–0.8. Though H2 addition resulted in an increase in the O2/CH4 uptake ratios across all five experimental sets, it was significantly different between the H2 and control treatments only in cultures of Set II and Set IV (Fig. 3C and Table S-2). These findings prompted us to measure the concentration of potentially excreted fermentation products, such as acetate, succinate, lactate, and 3-hydroxybutyrate, in Set IV cultures incubated with and without the addition of 2% H2. Cultures of Set I without the addition of 2% H2 were used as an additional control (detailed in section 2.3). Notably, we detected high amounts of excreted acetate in all three culture treatments (Fig. S-3A). However, the concentration of acetate in Set I cultures was about 50% less than in those of Set IV. The addition of 2% H2 to Set IV cultures resulted in a decrease in excreted acetate. Other excreted metabolites, such as succinate, lactate, and 3-hydroxybutyrate, were detected only in small amounts in all three culture treatments (Fig. S-3A)."
16,Thermodynamic calculations for cell carbon synthesis under H2 availability,"3.2 Thermodynamic calculations for cell carbon synthesis under H2 availability In order to compare the theoretical impact of H2 addition on maximum cell carbon synthesis between full aerobic CH4-only and O2-limited CH4/H2-combined conditions, we applied the thermodynamic electron equivalents (eeq) model two (TEEM2) with some modifications (McCarty, 2007). This model was created for aerobic heterotrophic reactions of C1 compounds that include oxygenases. Theoretically, the energy reactions for full aerobic CH4 oxidation can be displayed by the stoichiometric Equation (1), where reaction free energy is based on one electron equivalents. The free energy of methane oxidation was calculated based on the half-reaction reduction potential for CH4 as the electron donor and O2 as the electron acceptor. (1) C H 4 + 1.5 O 2 = C O 2 + H 2 O Δ G 0 ' = − 102.25 k J / e e q (2) 2 H 2 + O 2 = 2 H 2 O Δ G 0 ' = − 237.34 k J / e e q (3) C H 4 + 0.5 O 2 + P Q Q = C H O H + P Q Q H 2 Δ G 0 ' = + 46.53 k J / e e q When H2 is added to SC2 cultures under Set IV, the free energy coming from H2 oxidation will be represented as shown in Equation (2). In addition, under O2-limited conditions without CH4-based respiration, the energy loss (ΔG fa = 46.53 kJ/eeq) for formaldehyde formation from CH4 (through the activity of pMMO and methanol dehydrogenase) has to be considered (Equation (3)). The TEEM2 model made it possible to calculate the true or maximum cell yield (Y C/C ) using either full aerobic CH4-only or O2-limited CH4/H2-combined conditions. The calculations of Y C/C where carried out based on Equation (4): (4) Y C / C = y d y x f s 0 Here, y d and y x indicate the degree of reduction of C1 electron donor and degree of reduction of cells, respectively. In case of CH4, y d equals to 8 and y x was estimated based on the assumed relative composition of cells (C5H7O2N) and equals to 4. Following, f s 0 which represents the true yield expressed as a fraction of electron donor converted for the synthesis (eeq cells/eeq donor), was calculated based on Equations (5) and (6) under the assumption of full aerobic CH4 oxidation and O2-limited CH4/H2-oxidation, respectively. (5) f s 0 = Δ G a ( O 2 ) − Δ G d ( C H 4 ) − ( q / p ) Δ G x y ( Δ G a ( O 2 ) − Δ G d ( C H 4 ) − ( q / p ) Δ G x y ) − Δ G s / ε (6) f s 0 = Δ G E q . ( 2 ) + Δ G f a ( Δ G E q . ( 2 ) + Δ G f a ) − Δ G s / ε In Equation (5), ΔG a (O2) and ΔG d (CH4) indicate the half-reaction reduction potential for electron acceptor (O2) and C1 electron donor (CH4) under full aerobic conditions. The half reaction reduction potential for O2 is −78.72 kJ/eeq and for CH4 is 23.53 kJ/eeq (McCarty, 2007). ΔG xy is the energy loss involved in oxygenase usage and is represented by the standard energy associated with NADH oxidation and equals to −219.2 kJ/mol. Next, p shows the number of electron equivalents per mol of substrate from half-reaction reduction equation and equals to 8 for CH4 (McCarty, 2007; Thauer et al., 1977). Value q indicates the number of oxygenase reactions per mole CH4. In aerobic methanotrophs, the oxygenase, namely pMMO, is used once during the oxidation of methane to CO2 and therefore, q = 1. In H2-treated cultures of Set IV, we assume that the electrons needed for the oxidation of CH4 to CH3OH are supplied by the oxidation of H2. Therefore, we did not include the energy loss for oxygenase reaction in Equation (6). ε represents the energy transfer efficiency with a value of 0.37. The ΔG s value represents the Gibbs free energy for cell synthesis reactions and is calculated based on Equation (7). (7) Δ G s ( C H 4 ) = ( Δ G f a − Δ G C H 4 ) ε m + ( Δ G i n − Δ G f a ) ε n + Δ G p c ε Aerobic methanotrophs oxidize CH4 to formaldehyde which is assimilated into cell biomass, either through the ribulose monophosphate pathway or the serine pathway (details in Section 1). Therefore, the energy loss (ΔG fa = 46.53 kJ/eeq) through the oxidation of CH4 to formaldehyde is included in the calculation of ΔGs. ΔG in is the half-reaction reduction potential for acetyl-CoA (30.9 kJ/eeq) and ΔG pc is the Gibbs free energy for the incorporation of acetyl-CoA into cell biomass (McCarty, 2007). ΔG pc equals to 13.45 kJ/eeq, when cells are incubated with nitrate as a nitrogen source (NMS for strain SC2) and with cell biomass formulation of C5H7O2N. Next, m = n and equals to 1 given that ΔG in -ΔG d (CH4)>0. In summary, ΔGs for strain SC2 with CH4 as C1 substrate equals to 56.27 kJ/eeq. In summary, our thermodynamic TEEM2 calculations (detailed in section 3.1) showed that the theoretical maximum cell yield (Y C/C ) for strain SC2 is 0.66 mol cell C/mol CH4 under full aerobic conditions using CH4 as the only energy source and 1.12 mol cell C/mol CH4 when CH4/H2-combined is considered as the energy source under O2-limited condition. Thus, the ratio between O2-limited H2 treatment and full aerobic methane oxidation equaled 1.7, indicating that the theoretical max yield of strain SC2 can be increased almost two-fold by the addition of 2% H2 under even oxygen-limited conditions."
17,Impact of H 2 concentration and duration of the H2 treatment on SC2 growth,"3.3 Impact of H 2 concentration and duration of the H2 treatment on SC2 growth The following experiments were performed using those culture conditions (6% CH4/3% O2, Set IV) that had the greatest H2 effect on strain SC2 in our physiological growth experiments (Fig. 3). To determine the most optimal H2 concentration for SC2 growth under Set IV conditions, cultures were treated with 0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 5% H2 and incubated in strict batch regime for 96 h. Cultures without H2 addition were used as a control. The increasing H2 concentrations had a positive effect on SC2 growth, with the highest growth rates in the cultures with 2% and 5% H2 (Fig. S-4). However, the growth rates observed for 2% and 5% H2 did not significantly differ. Hydrogen was completely consumed in the SC2 cultures with 2% H2 within the 96-h incubation period, while only 45% of the available H2 had been utilized in the SC2 cultures with 5% H2 in the headspace. To assess how the duration of the H2 treatment affects growth, SC2 cultures were incubated for a total of 37 d, with and without the addition of 2% H2. To maintain the SC2 cultures in the exponential growth phase and thus to maximize the effects of H2 treatment, the headspace of the 10-day and 37-day cultures was regularly re-adjusted to the starting concentrations of CH4/O2/H2 (Set IV, Fig. 1). The cell dry weight was significantly increased in H2-treated cultures already after short-term incubation (19 h) (Fig. S-5A). However, the positive impact of H2 availability was clearly more pronounced after long-term incubation (37 d), with significant effects across all SC2 growth parameters monitored over incubation time (Fig. S-5C). In particular, cell dry weight and biomass yield were increased by 25% and 52% in H2-treated cultures, respectively. Concomitantly, their CH4 consumption rate was decreased by 34%. Furthermore, the growth rate of H2-treated cultures slightly increased (p-value = 0.093) with extended incubation period (37 d) relative to short-term incubation (19 h). In consequence, we observed a highly significant difference (p-value ≤ 0.01) in the growth rate between H2-treated and control cultures during the long-term incubation (Fig. S-5). Subsequent analysis of the intracellular energy metabolites showed that in Set IV, the concentration of available ATP was significantly increased in cells of the H2-treated cultures (18.66 ± 3.51 μmol/gCDW) relative to cells in the untreated controls (14.27 ± 1.00 μmol/gCDW). In contrast, we detected only minor cellular NADH levels with no significant difference between the H2 and control treatments (Fig. S-3B)."
18,Effects of H2 availability on the SC2 proteome,"3.4 Effects of H2 availability on the SC2 proteome SC2 biomass was collected for proteomics after short-term (19 h) and long-term (10 d and 37 d) incubations, with or without the addition of H2 (Fig. 4 ). The experimental approach is detailed in section 2.4. Overall, about 63% (2526 proteins) of the SC2 reference proteome (4040 proteins, Uniprot Proteomes Database) was covered with high reproducibility among three biological replicates, in both H2 and control treatments after 19 h, 10 d, and 37 d of incubation (Fig. 4, Fig. S-6 and Table S-3). The identified proteins covered almost all proteins (76 proteins) involved in the central carbon metabolism of strain SC2, including all subunits of pMMO1 and pMMO2 (except PmoC2), and all proteins involved in methanol oxidation, formaldehyde utilization, serine pathway, glycerate regeneration, EMC pathway, and TCA cycle (Table S-4 and Fig. S-7). In the short-term (19 h) incubation, H2 availability induced a significant upregulation of 17 proteins (q-value < 0.05, log2-fold change ratio ≥ 1) (Fig. 4 and Table S-5). This involved the concurrent upregulation of all three subunits of the low-affinity Group 1d hydrogenase and small subunit of regulatory Group 2b hydrogenase (log2 change ratio 3.1) (Fig. 4 and Table S-6). Simultaneously, nine members of the proteins responsible for hydrogenase expression, formation, and maturation were significantly upregulated (Fig. 4 and Table S-5). Notably, we also observed a significant upregulation of NifH and NifX subunits of the nitrogenase enzyme complex, with a log2 fold change ratio of 2.3 and 1.0, respectively (Table S-6). In addition, ferredoxin protein was differentially regulated with high significance (log2 change ratio of 3.5). In mid-term (10 d or 240 h) incubation, the number of differentially expressed proteins was greater than in short-term (19 h) incubation. A total of 26 and 20 proteins were significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively (Table S-5). The expression level of Group 1d hydrogenase, hydrogenase accessory proteins (maturation/formation/expression) and the nitrogenase NifH and NifX subunits maintained significantly increased in the H2-treated cells (Table S-6). In addition, the small and large subunits of Group 2b regulatory hydrogenase and FixX were significantly upregulated (Fig. 4 and Table S-6). Serine protease inhibitors (Kazal domain proteins), ABC transporter proteins, cytochrome P450, NADH-quinone oxidoreductase subunit H and several other proteins were among the downregulated proteins (Table S-5). In long-term (37 d or 888 h) incubation, the majority of the above-mentioned proteins maintained upregulated on a constantly high level (Table S-5). These included the Group 1d and Group 2b hydrogenases, all nine hydrogenase accessory proteins and NifH protein (Fig. 4 and Table S-6). In addition to FixX, all other subunits of the FixABCX protein complex got upregulated (Table S-6). By contrast, two other hydrogenases of strain SC2, namely the high-affinity Group 1h/5 hydrogenase and Group 3b bidirectional hydrogenase, did not respond to the H2 treatments (Fig. 4 and Table S-6). Two subunits of pMMO2 were significantly upregulated (log2 fold change ratio of 1.6 [PmoA2] and 2.3 [PmoB2]), while there was no differential regulation of pMMO1 (Table S-6). In addition, the carbon starvation protein CstA was significantly upregulated (Table S-6). Finally, the NADH dehydrogenase I (complex I) with two subunits (20 kDa and 49 kDa), along with cytochrome C oxidase subunit III, was significantly downregulated in response to H2 availability, but only after 37 days of incubation (Fig. 4 and Table S-5)."
19,Predicted protein-protein interactions in response to the long-term H2 treatment,"3.5 Predicted protein-protein interactions in response to the long-term H2 treatment In order to display the relationship between differentially regulated proteins after long-term incubation (37 d), protein-protein interactions were predicted in silico for selected proteins (based on the protein list in Table S-6). A total of 35 proteins were blasted against the Methylocystis sp. strain SC2 protein database available in STRING. STRING “kmeans clustering” revealed five functionally distinct protein clusters (Fig. 5 ). The largest cluster included uptake Group 1d, regulatory Group 2b and high-affinity Group 1h/5 hydrogenases and all hydrogenase accessory proteins; however, the Group 3b with its two identified subunits clustered separately from the main hydrogenase cluster. Complex I with its two subunits also grouped separately from the hydrogenase cluster. Though, these three clusters were highly interrelated. The next largest cluster included the three subunits of pMMO1 and pMMO2, and NifH protein. The FixABCX complex formed another cluster (Fig. 5). In both the main hydrogenase and pMMO clusters, most of the proteins were predicted to have strong protein-protein “binding” interactions. In addition to ″binding″ actions, there was a strong ″catalysis″ interaction between FixA, FixB and FixX proteins of the FixABCX complex. Moreover, FixA and FixB exhibited a ″biochemical reaction″ interaction linked to the electron transport reaction between these two proteins (Fig. 5). Four differentially regulated proteins were not assigned to any of the five clusters; namely ferredoxin (Fer2), cytochrome c oxidase subunit III (COX3), carbon starvation protein (CstA), and nitrogenase-associated NifX protein."
20,Differential SC2 gene expression in response to H2 availability,"3.6 Differential SC2 gene expression in response to H2 availability In order to relate our proteomics results to mRNA expression, we selected eight genes involved in methane, nitrogen, and hydrogen metabolisms to quantify their differential expression in response to H2 availability by RT-qPCR. As for proteomics, samples for RNA extraction were collected after 19 h, 10 d, and 37 d of culture incubation under 6% CH4/3% O2/He atmosphere, with and without the addition of 2% H2. The eight genes encoded the large subunits (LSU) of Group 1d, Group 1h/5, Group 2b and Group 3b hydrogenases, nifH (nitrogenase), pmoA1 (pMMO1) and pmoA2 (pMMO2), and rplI (Table S-1). The latter gene was used as a reference in RT-qPCR. Overall, the transcript expression patterns of these genes agreed well with their proteomics results. In the presence of H2, the transcript levels of Group 1d and Group 2b hydrogenases were significantly increased already after short-term (19 h) incubation (p-value ≤ 0.01 of their log2-fold change ratio values) and remained constantly high during mid-term (10 d) and long-term (37 d) incubations (Fig. 6 and Table S-7). In none of the three incubation periods, the genes encoding LSU of the Group 1h/5 and Group 3b hydrogenases showed a differential transcript expression in response to H2 availability. The expression of pmoA1 gene was not affected at all by H2 availability. The expression of pmoA2 gene was not affected by H2 availability after short-term (19 h) and mid-term (10 d) incubations, but its expression was significantly increased after long-term (37 d) incubation (log2 fold change ratio of 1.4, p-value ≤ 0.01) (Fig. 6 and Table S-7). Thus, the effect of H2 availability on the differential expression of pmoA2 corresponds perfectly to the differential regulation of PmoA2 and PmoB2 subunits (Fig. 6). The transcript level of nifH was increased in response to H2 availability. This increase was significant in both short-term (19 h) and long-term (37 d) incubations. As expected, the rplI gene showed no differential transcript expression in response to H2 availability (Fig. 6 and Table S-7)."
21,The effect of chemical inhibitors on biomass yield and H2 oxidation capacity of strain SC2,"3.7 The effect of chemical inhibitors on biomass yield and H2 oxidation capacity of strain SC2 The results of both proteomics and RT-qPCR prompted us to test the connection of Group 1d hydrogenase to other components of the electron transport chain, primarily complex I and FixABCX complex. The tests involved the incubation of H2-treated and control cultures of Set IV with either catechol or a mixture of metronidazole/catechol, or without the addition of inhibitors. The incubation with both catechol alone and metronidazole/catechol showed a decrease in the overall growth rates across all the experimental treatments, in both H2-treated and control cultures (Table S-8). We observed a significant difference in biomass yield between control and H2 treatments only in the cultures incubated with catechol alone, but not in those incubated with metronidazole/catechol (Fig. 7 A). Hydrogen was rapidly oxidized within the first 70 h of incubation in the inhibitor-untreated cultures of Set IV (Fig. 7B). In contrast, hydrogen consumption significantly decreased upon the addition of catechol and almost stopped upon the addition of metronidazole in combination with catechol (Fig. 7B and Table S-8). None of the treatments affected the methane oxidation capacity of the cultures (Table S-8)."
22,Discussion,"In recent years, aerobic H2-oxidizing bacteria were considered a major target for metabolic engineering to improve their ability to act as a source of renewable fuel molecules and high quality feed proteins (Nybo et al., 2015). Among methanotrophs, verrucomicrobial Methylacidiphilum spp. were recently shown to oxidize CH4 and H2 under aerobic conditions (e.g., Mohammadi et al., 2017). In particular, it was demonstrated that the biomass yield of Methylacidiphilum sp. RTK17.1 significantly increased when CH4 and H2 were simultaneously supplied under O2-limited conditions (3.5%) (Carere et al., 2017). Around the same time, Greening and colleagues (Carere et al., 2017; Greening et al., 2016) showed that hydrogenase-encoding genes are not only present in verrucomicrobial methanotrophs but also widely distributed among proteobacterial methanotrophs, including Methylocystis spp. A genomic survey of our model organism revealed to us that strain SC2 possesses the complete genetic machinery for H2 oxidation. Therefore, we decided to test the impact of H2 supplementation on the growth of strain SC2."
23,Metabolic adaptation of strain SC2 to H2 availability under CH4/O2 limited conditions,"4.1 Metabolic adaptation of strain SC2 to H2 availability under CH4/O2 limited conditions The results published for Methylacidiphilum sp. RTK17.1 prompted us to test the effect of a similar H2 (2%) concentration on the growth activity of strain SC2 in combination with different CH4/O2 mixing ratios (Fig. 1). We found that under strict batch regime H2 addition did not affect the CH4 oxidation rates under elevated O2 (15%) conditions. However, O2 limitation (3%) in combination with carbon source limitation (6% CH4) resulted in the greatest H2 consumption rate among all tested conditions (Set IV, Fig. 1 and Table S-2). In fact, SC2 cultures of Set IV showed twice higher H2 consumption rates than those (Set II) grown under elevated CH4 concentration and incubated under strict batch regime (Table S-2). In addition, the biomass yield was increased two-fold in H2-treated Set IV cultures within the first 70 h of incubation relative to the control cultures (Fig. 3A and Table S-2), and the CH4 oxidation rate was reduced by 50% (Fig. 3B). Concentrations greater than 2% H2 had no further effect on growth rate or biomass yield (Figure S-4). Thus, the 2% H2 treatment under CH4/O2 limitation (Set IV) provided optimal growth conditions for strain SC2, thereby resulting in a maximum biomass yield with less CH4 consumed (Fig. 3A and B). Long-term fed-batch experiments revealed that the hydrogen effect was more substantial after long-term incubation (37 d) than after short-term incubation (19 h) (Fig. S-2). Thus, strain SC2 adapts to the continuous supply of H2 as an alternative energy source, thereby leading to an increased biomass yield and concomitant decrease in CH4 consumption. In addition, the growth rate of H2-treated cultures increased with the duration of treatment (Fig. S-5), suggesting that both CH4 assimilation efficiency and CH4 assimilation rate of strain SC2 increased over time."
24,The O2/CH4 ratio is a crucial parameter for the H2 effect on SC2 growth,"4.2 The O2/CH4 ratio is a crucial parameter for the H2 effect on SC2 growth We assumed that, similar to the verrucomicrobial strain RTK17.1 (Carere et al., 2017), Methylocystis sp. strain SC2 is able to regulate the rates of CH4 and H2 consumption in response to O2 availability; in order to balance between energy generation and biomass yield. Our CH4 and O2 consumption measurements revealed that the O2/CH4 uptake ratios greatly depend on the headspace mixing ratios of CH4/O2 at culture start (Table S-2 and Fig. 3C). Given that under non-limiting oxygen supply, energy for growth is completely gained by the oxidation of CH4 to CO2, the O2/CH4 uptake ratio is considered to be 1.5 (section 3.2, Equation (1)). It was recently shown that under O2 limitation, gammaproteobacterial type I methanotrophs are able to switch from CH4 respiration to a fermentation type of metabolism, using oxygen only for the activation of CH4 molecules but not for respiration (Gilman et al., 2017; Kalyuzhnaya et al., 2013). The decrease of the O2/CH4 uptake ratio in our O2-limited treatments (Fig. 3C) suggested that strain SC2 may also switch from CH4 respiration to CH4-based fermentation. In that case, O2 would only be used for CH4 oxidation to CH3OH and production of formaldehyde (section 3.2, Equation (3)), which is either assimilated into cell carbon or directed into fermentative pathways. Our assumption was confirmed by the detection of typical fermentation products excreted by SC2 cells into the culture medium (Fig. S-3A). Similar to Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1C (Gilman et al., 2017) and M. alcaliphilum 20 Z (Kalyuzhnaya et al., 2013), strain SC2 produces and accumulates different short-chain fatty acids like acetate, succinate, lactate and 3-hydroxybutyrate under O2-limited conditions, both in H2-treated and control cultures (Fig. S-3A). However, H2 addition resulted, relative to the control cultures of Set IV, in a significant increase in the O2/CH4 uptake ratio and decrease in the concentration of excreted metabolites (Fig. 3C, Fig. S-3A and Table S-2), corroborating that strain SC2 is able to conduct energetically favorable aerobic H2 respiration. This is further evidenced by the significantly higher intracellular ATP level in the H2-treated cultures than in those without H2 addition (Fig. S-3B). In consequence, we observed a greater incorporation of CH4-derived carbon into cell biomass. Notably, our experimental results are in good agreement with thermodynamic model calculations (detailed in section 3.2). These revealed that the theoretical max yield almost doubles for H2-treated SC2 cultures incubated under O2-limited conditions relative to cultures incubated under full aerobic CH4-only conditions."
25,Differential regulation of key enzymes in response to H2 availability,"4.3 Differential regulation of key enzymes in response to H2 availability Hydrogen addition induced a specific proteome response of strain SC2. In particular, we observed a significant increase in the enzyme levels of the low-affinity Group 1d hydrogenase and Group 2b regulatory hydrogenase in both short-term (19 h) and long-term (37 d) treatments. These two hydrogenases are known to be O2-tolerant due to the presence of a [4Fe3S] cluster that protects the O2-sensitive active site from oxidative damage (Greening et al., 2016). As discussed previously (Carere et al., 2017), these enzymes can therefore maintain their activity at relatively high O2 tensions (3–15%) as applied in our cultivation study. All three subunits of the low-affinity Group 1d hydrogenase were highly expressed and significantly upregulated. This enzyme catalyzes hydrogenotrophic respiration using O2 as the terminal electron acceptor. It is a heterodimeric periplasmic [NiFe]-hydrogenase that is attached to the membrane by a b-type cytochrome and is primarily involved in the generation of a proton gradient through the cytoplasmic membrane (Friedrich et al., 2005). This enzyme is directly linked to the quinone pool of the aerobic respiratory chain, thereby supplying electrons either for the methane monooxygenase reaction or the terminal oxidase complex (Carere et al., 2017). The significantly increased production of Group 2b regulatory hydrogenase enzyme may be explained by the requirement of aerobic H2-oxidizing bacteria to respond rapidly to changes in H2 supply, given that aerobic hydrogen oxidizers receive H2 only occasionally and in limited amounts. Therefore, the regulatory hydrogenase that forms a complex with a histidine protein kinase rapidly recognizes H2 in the environment and transmits the signal to a response regulator, which in turn controls transcription of the hydrogenase genes (Greening and Cook, 2014). Furthermore, it was shown that the two gene clusters encoding the Group 2b and Group 1d hydrogenases in Ralstonia eutropha are coordinately regulated and transcribed in response to H2 and the amount of available carbon (Friedrich et al., 2005). Our RT-qPCR results suggest that such a coordinated regulation may also occur in strain SC2. The expression of genes encoding Group 2b hydrogenase (hupV) and Group 1d hydrogenase (hupB) was significantly increased during the whole H2 treatment (Fig. 6). Hydrogenase transcription is repressed under the elevated concentration of carbon sources (Schwartz et al., 1999), but the uptake hydrogenase will be transcribed at high level under carbon limitation due to the inhibition of the histidine kinase of regulatory hydrogenase (Greening and Cook, 2014). In fact, the H2 oxidation rate was very low when strain SC2 was grown under elevated CH4 concentrations. We observed no growth rate difference between control and H2-treated cultures (Figure S-1 and Table S-3). By contrast, SC2 cells rapidly responded to the addition of H2 under limiting concentrations of CH4 (6%) and O2 (3%) in the headspace, resulting in the highest H2 oxidation rate among all four treatments. In addition to Group 1d uptake hydrogenase and Group 2b regulatory hydrogenase, nine proteins involved in hydrogenase expression, formation, and maturation were significantly upregulated (Fig. 4 and Table S-7). The genes (hup genes) encoding HupJ and HupH proteins are usually localized downstream from the structural genes (Vignais et al., 2001). The Hup proteins are involved in the maturation of the heterodimeric [NiFe] hydrogenase enzymes. Another set of proteins, encoded by the hyp (‘p’ for pleiotropic) genes, is involved in the insertion of Ni, Fe, CO and CN into the active sites of the uptake and regulatory hydrogenases. Accordingly, all Hup and Hyp proteins clustered together with uptake and regulatory hydrogenases in the predicted protein-protein interaction network (Fig. 5). Moreover, the network indicated a strong “binding” interaction between the two hydrogenases (Group 1d and 2b) and Hup maturation proteins, presumably due to the fact that most hydrogenases exhibit oxidoreductase activity and are involved in the electron transport chain. A highly specific binding between proteins of the electron transport chain is a prerequisite for ensuring efficient electron transfer (Le and Ou, 2016). Another important finding of our proteomics experiments was the upregulation of NifH and NifX nitrogenase proteins, even though our experiments were conducted under a nitrogen-free headspace. Strain SC2 contains the complete set of nitrogenase genes and is able to fix atmospheric N2, when alternative nitrogen sources are unavailable (Dam et al., 2013). Many diazotrophic (nitrogen-fixing) Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria possess uptake hydrogenases encoded by hup genes, which are usually co-expressed with the nitrogenase complex (Annan et al., 2012; Brito et al., 2005; Vignais et al., 2001). These uptake hydrogenases are known to re-utilize H2 produced by nitrogenase activity, thereby reconstituting some of the ATP consumed during nitrogen fixation (Rey et al., 2006). Moreover, in proteobacterial diazotrophic bacteria, special NtrC-like transcription factors, namely HoxA (Durmowicz and Maier, 1997; Van Soom et al., 1997), control the transcription of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism and, in addition, hupSL genes encoding uptake hydrogenase (Weyman et al., 2008). In the genome of strain SC2, hoxA (gene ID BN69_2342) is located upstream of the hupSL (Group 1d) and hupVU (Group 2b) hydrogenase genes (Dam et al., 2012). In our study, the transcription factor encoded by hoxA was higher expressed in H2-treated SC2 cultures than in control cultures (gene ID BN69_2342, Table S-5). Thus, like in other diazotrophic bacteria, hoxA may induce not only the upregulation of uptake and regulatory hydrogenases in strain SC2, but also particular structural subunits of nitrogenase. Further discussion on the proteomic effects of H2 addition can be found in supplementary information, with focus on Group 1h/5 high-affinity hydrogenase, Group 3b soluble hydrogenase, and pMMO1/pMMO2."
26,Proposed model of electron flow and energy conservation in strain SC2 under mixed utilization of CH4 and H2,"4.4 Proposed model of electron flow and energy conservation in strain SC2 under mixed utilization of CH4 and H2 The collective results of proteomics, RT-qPCR, and the treatments with chemical inhibitors prompted us to propose a model (Fig. 8 ) of how strain SC2 responds to H2 availability under CH4 and O2 limitation. Recently, Bordel and colleagues showed by genome-scale metabolic modeling and experimental research on three Methylocystis spp., including strain SC2, that the electron supply for methane oxidation functions as a so-called “redox arm” mechanism (Bordel et al., 2019a). Under non-limiting substrate conditions, complex I (NADH dehydrogenase I) catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone upon oxidative phosphorylation. Eventually, ubiquinone further serves as the electron donor for pMMO. Our proteomics results revealed that upon long-term incubation with H2 and constant upregulation of Group 1d hydrogenase, complex I was significantly downregulated. Thus, our proteomics results suggest that during our long-term (37 d) incubation experiment, the functional role of complex I was taken over by Group 1d hydrogenase, providing necessary electrons to pMMO through H2 oxidation (Fig. 8). In contrast to complex I, the FixABCX complex was significantly upregulated (Fig. 4 and Table S-6). Genes encoding FixABCX proteins are located within the nif cluster. Under nitrogen-fixing conditions, the Fix proteins transfer electrons from NADH to the nitrogenase complex via ferredoxin, thereby providing energy for nitrogenase activity (Carvalho et al., 2010). As already discussed above, it is well known that in most diazotrophic bacteria, production and activity of uptake hydrogenase and nitrogenase are linked to each other and regulated by the same transcriptional regulator (HoxA) (Durmowicz and Maier, 1997; Van Soom et al., 1997). Therefore, it may be that the FixABCX complex is co-upregulated with the Group 1d hydrogenase under H2 conditions. On the other hand, it is known that FixABCX can oxidize NADH by flavin-based electron bifurcation (Buckel and Thauer, 2018; Ledbetter et al., 2017). Upon NADH oxidation by the FixABCX complex (Fig. 8), bifurcation is initiated at the flavin in FixA, with one electron being transferred to the quinone pool via the flavins in FixB and FixC and the other electron being transferred to ferredoxin via the low-potential FixX subunit (Edgren and Nordlund, 2004; Ledbetter et al., 2017). Therefore, it may be reasonable to speculate that long-term incubation of strain SC2 under H2 atmosphere induces a switch from complex I to flavin-based electron bifurcation to provide additional electrons to the electron transport chain. To test the functional link between Group 1d hydrogenase, complex I and FixABCX complex, we incubated H2-treated and control cultures of Set IV with either catechol or a mixture of metronidazole/catechol, or without the addition of inhibitors. As reported by Bordel et al. (2019b), 0.4 mM catechol inhibits the function of complex I in Methylocystis spp. The incubation with catechol reduced the hydrogen oxidation rate of strain SC2 by 50% relative to inhibitor-untreated cultures (Fig. 7B and Table S-8). Since catechol acts as an ionophore, our results suggest that, similar to Chloroflexi (Islam et al., 2019), H2 oxidation is tightly coupled to the electron transport chain, and this interaction may be linked to the electrical gradient. However, we still observed a significant difference in biomass yield between H2-treated and control cultures (Fig. 7A). Therefore, we conclude that complex I is not of essential importance for the function of Group 1d hydrogenase and growth of strain SC2 under H2 conditions. In addition to catechol, we treated SC2 cultures with a metronidazole/catechol mixture to test the potential function of FixABCX complex and its link to both Group 1d hydrogenase and electron transport chain. Previous studies have shown that 2 mM metronidazole completely inhibits the activity of nitrogenase, being specifically reduced by low-potential electron donors, such as ferredoxins and flavodoxins, in diazotrophic bacteria (Edgren and Nordlund, 2004; Kelley and Nicholas, 1981; Peterson, 1988; Tetley and Bishop, 1979). The metronidazole/catechol treatment almost completely inhibited the H2 oxidation activity of strain SC2 (Fig. 7B), thereby diminishing the biomass yield difference between H2-treated and control cultures (Fig. 7A). This result provides further evidence that the hydrogenase, nitrogenase, and FixABCX complexes are co-regulated in strain SC2. However, the question of whether FixABCX takes over the NADH-oxidizing function of complex I under H2 conditions remained unanswered. Therefore, the exact role of the FixABCX complex under H2 availability has to be elucidated in future studies."
27,Conclusions,"Methylocystis is the second methanotroph group with experimental evidence that hydrogen can be utilized as an energy source for growth. Given that most proteobacterial methanotrophs have been shown to possess the genetic potential to produce Group 1d uptake hydrogenases and Group 2b regulatory hydrogenases (Greening et al., 2016), the metabolic capacity to utilize H2 is most likely not only limited to strain SC2 but widely distributed among both alphaproteobacterial (type IIa) and gammaproteobacterial (type I) methanotrophs. In summary, strain SC2 can utilize H2 as an energy source to optimize biomass yield under CH4 and O2 limitation. If not assimilated into cell carbon, CH4 consumption is directed towards fermentative pathways. Hydrogen for use as an electron donor to support methanotroph growth can be produced by non-expensive green energy sources such as wind and solar energy powered water electrolysis (Matassa et al., 2015). Thus, H2 may be a promising alternative energy source in biotechnologically oriented methanotroph projects that aim to maximize biomass yield from CH4, such as the production of high-quality feed protein."
