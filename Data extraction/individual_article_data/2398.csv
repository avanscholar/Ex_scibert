0,Introduction,"With the reduction in the amount of fossil fuels globally, the demand for alternative energy sources is growing rapidly [1–5]. As a substitute for fossil fuels, biomass is highly promising to be transferred for value-added products both in academic and industrial application [6–8]. Among the many biomass-derived chemicals that have been studied, furfural, which can be produced from cellulose, has attracted great attention [9–15]. With the increasingly severe energy crisis and environmental problems worldwide, the demand for furfural will continue to grow in many developed countries such as America, Germany and so on. In view of the important role of furfural in the field of organic chemicals and energy, the existing furfural production process needs to be improved urgently [16]. Some sought after compounds that can be obtained from furfural (FFA) include furfuryl alcohol (FAL), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFOL), methyl furan (MF) and methyl tetrahydrofuran (MeTHF) [17–20]. The aqueous phase hydrogenative condensation of furfural (FFA) is particularly attractive, which can generate cyclopentanone (CPO) and cyclopentanol (CPL) [21–22]. CPL is widely used in the production of pharmaceuticals, dyes and fragrances, as well as solvents for preparation of pharmaceuticals and fragrances [23–25]. Therefore, CPL is in great demand, but it still relies on the preparation of fossil-based raw materials. In the past few years, tremendous efforts have been devoted to the transformation of FFA to CPL over noble metal-based catalysts. Pt/C catalyst was first reported by Hronec et al. for the reaction with 81.3% total yield of rearrangement products [26]. Later, bimetallic Pd-Cu/C catalyst was designed by the same group with appropriate Pd0 (metal site) and Cu+ (Lewis acid site) nanoparticles distribution on carbon and presented excellent catalytic activity [27]. However, the selectivity was not good, and various byproducts were formed, in which CPO, CPL, furan-2-ylmethanol (FOL) and THFOL were generated. Herein a large number of noble catalysts based on Pd, Pt, Ru and Au [28–31] have been studied for the selective hydrogenation of FFA to CPL. For example, Stones et al designed a complex trans-[(2,9-dipyridyl-1,10- phenanthroline)(CH3CN)2Ru](OTf)2 catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of biomass-based FFA to CPL with a 35% selectivity of CPL in aqueous medium at elevated temperature (150–200 °C) and hydrogen pressure (5.12 MPa) [32]. However, catalytic reactions using furfuryl alcohol as a substrate were limited by the formation of solid resins with the product yields showing a strong negative correlation with increasing substrate concentration and maximum yields of 1,4-pentanediol and cyclopentanol being 23 and 41%, respectively. Additionally, Wang et al designed a highly active RuMo/CNT catalyst for FFA hydrogenation, obtaining complete conversion, 74% selectivity to CPL and 9% to CPO under a mild reaction condition (160 °C, 4 h) [33]. Mironenko et al. achieved a complete conversion of furfural and 77% selectivity of CPL over bimetallic 1.5% PdRu/CNTs catalyst at 473 K, 8 MPa H2 and 10 h [28]. From the consideration of high price of precious metal, some non-noble metal catalysts also have been studied. The selective generation of CPL from FFR over Ni-based catalysts has been mentioned by Zhou et al. They showed that 30 wt% Ni/CNTs could achieve a CPL yield of 83.6% at 96.5% conversion at 140 °C under 5 MPa [34]. Later, optimized NiMo/CNTs was designed by the same group, which could achieve a CPL yield of 88.6% at full conversion at 150 °C under 5 MPa after 6 h [35]. Although non-noble metal catalysts could achieve a high selective hydrogenation of FFA to CPL, there are still many challenges to overcome, such as elevated temperature, high pressure, poor selectivity of CPL and recyclability of the catalysts [36–37]. Recently, a newcomer in the field of hydrogenolysis material is the class of MOFs, which are evolving as a prospective candidate for hydrogenolysis of raw biomass material and continuously finding greater attention now a days especially owing to their merits of large unambiguous surface area and effective catalytic activity. The combination of MOFs with metal-based catalysts can importantly provide higher catalytic activity. Additionally, along with the Ni-based materials incorporation of another appropriate metal ion aids in enhancing the catalytic activity further, subsequently could be applied in the catalytic depolymerization of raw biomass materials. For example, Liu et al [38] reported a novel Ni-based catalyst, fabricated by one-step thermal decomposition of Ni-based metal-organic frameworks, was applied in hydrogenation of triolein to green diesel. Herein, we demonstrated the synthesis of a series of Mo-based catalysts supported on a porous material MOF (i.e., BTC = 1,3,5-benzene tricarboxylate, DHTA = 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid, PTA = p-phthalic acid) for highly efficient transformation of FFA to CPL in aqueous medium, which exhibited an excellent conversion of FFA compared with single metal catalyst Ni/C. In fact, Mo-based catalysts are emerging as good hydrodeoxygenation catalysts in aqueous phase, but few researches have indicated the use of Mo-based catalysts in the conversion of FFA, especially in the rearrangement reaction. In this work, we reported the design of synergistic NiMo bimetallic catalysts for the selective rearrangement of FFA to CPL under a mild condition. More significantly, the integrality of the catalyst retained well even after up to five runs, and could be recycled magnetically. In addition, all of the catalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, NH3-TPD and Raman analysis, and the mechanism was proposed in the end."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) and hexaammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O) were provided by Aladdin Industrial Inc. Shanghai, China; 1,3,5-benzene tricarboxylate, 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid, p-phthalic acid, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and isopropanol (99.99%) were provided from Sigma-Aldrich. Deionized water was applied for all experiments. H2 gas was provided by local place. All reagents were of analytical grade and were used without further purification."
3,General procedure for FFA hydrogenation,"2.2 General procedure for FFA hydrogenation In a typical run, FFA (100 mg), catalyst (10 mg) and water (10 mL) were placed in a stainless Parr autoclave (25 mL). After purging the reactor several times with H2 (99.99%). The reactions were subsequently conducted at the desired temperature and stirred at 600 rpm. At the end of the reaction, the reactor was cooled to room temperature and the pressure was released and the catalyst was isolated from the solution by centrifugation, washed with i-PrOH and reused directly in the next run. The reaction solution was analyzed by GC/MS (Agilent 7890) equipped with a HP-innowax capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm) using the n-dodecane as an internal standard. The conversion and yield were evaluated on the basis of the amounts of furfural. The conversion of furfural (mol%) and products yield (mol%) were calculated according to the following formula: (1) Conversion = mole o f r e a c t e d s u b s t r a t e total m o l e o f s u b s t r a t e f e e d ∗ 100 % (2) Yield o f C P L = mole o f C P L total m o l e o f s u b s t r a t e f e e d ∗ 100 % (3) Yield o f o t h e r p r o d u c t s = mole o f c o r r e s p o n d i n g p r o d u c t s total m o l e o f s u b s t r a t e f e e d ∗ 100 %"
4,Catalyst preparation,"2.3 Catalyst preparation 2.3.1 Synthesize of Ni-MOF-Mo catalysts NiMo/MOF was synthesized through a solvothermal strategy. In a typical synthesis, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (10 mmol), (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (2 mmol), benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (50 mmol) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (60 mL) were sealed into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 12 h. After the reaction, the solid was centrifuged, washed with isopropanol, and dried overnight at 90 °C, which was denoted as Ni-MOF-Mo0.2. Other catalysts using 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid, p-phthalic acid as substrates were named as Ni-MOF-Mo0.2-DHTA and Ni-MOF-Mo0.2-PTA. Other catalysts using Fe, Zn, Cu, Ce as metal source and benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid as substrate were named as Ni-MOF-Fe, Ni-MOF-Zn, Ni-MOF-Cu and Ni-MOF-Ce. In addition, Ni-MOF-Mo0.4 and Ni-MOF-Mo0.6 was synthesized using 10 mmol Ni(NO3)2·6H2O with 4 mmol and 6 mmol (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, respectively. 2.3.2 Synthesize of Ni/C-Mo catalysts The resulting powder was isolated and heated at 500 °C for 3 h under N2 flow. The as-prepared materials were denoted as Ni/C-Mo. Other catalysts using Fe, Zn, Cu, Ce as metal source were named as Ni-MOF-Fe, Ni-MOF-Zn, Ni-MOF-Cu and Ni-MOF-Ce. In addition, different ratios of Ni/C-Mo catalysts (i.e., Ni/C-Mo0.2, Ni/C-Mo0.4 and Ni/C-Mo0.6) were synthesized by the same method."
5,Catalyst characterization,"2.4 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was characterized on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray powder diffractometer. The morphology of the so-obtained samples was investigated by using a TESCAN-VEGA3 scanning electron microscopy (SEM) instrument. The X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was examined on an ESCALAB-250 (Thermo-VG Scientific, USA) spectrometer with Al Kα (1486.6 eV) irradiation source. The acidity of catalysts was determined by NH3-TPD on a Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 instrument. Raman spectra were recorded at room temperature using a Renishaw InVia micro-Raman spectrometer with laser excitation at 532 nm."
6,Optimization of FFA hydrogenation,
7,Effect of different catalysts,"3.1 Effect of different catalysts The as-prepared Ni/C-Mo catalysts were investigated for the reaction of furfural (FFA) to cyclopentanol (CPL) in aqueous medium. The conversion of FFA and yields of target products on different catalysts could be clearly seen in Table 1 . The catalytic process was carried out under the following conditions: temperature: 140 °C, time: 2 h, H2 pressure: 2 MPa, furfural 100 mg and 10 mg of catalyst. Four main products (FOL, THFOL, CPO and CPL) were detected in our catalytic system. From the results given in Table 1 almost all the catalysts used in the hydrogenation of FFA were able to achieve the conversion of FFA under the conditions employed. The yield of CPL on the catalysts used was however significantly different with the NiMo-based catalyst being clearly more selective for generating CPL. A blank experiment without any catalysts was first carried out to find that it failed to convent FFA to any products (Table 1, entry 1). Moreover, solo C (calcined MOF-BTC precursor without any metal loading) as catalyst led to a poor conversion (Table 1, entries 1–2). Signal metal-based catalysts (Ni/C and Mo/C) was improved this catalytic reaction a little bit. However, large amount of FFA was recovered in the end the catalytic process (Table 1, entries 3–4). NiMo bimetallic catalysts achieved a significant improvement in the hydrogenation of FFA, probably due to the synergistic effect of Ni with Mo. A previous study reported that hydrogenation of furfural catalyzed by the (10 + 10)% NiMo/CNT catalyst could give better reaction activity towards CPL (about 89%) within 6 h, which might ascribe to the improvement in BET surface area and the better dispersibility of active metal [35]. In our Ni/C-Mo catalytic system, similar result was observed. 100% conversion of FFA was achieved over Ni/C-Mo catalyst in aqueous medium. When Ni/C-Mo0.4 was used as catalyst, significantly high CPL yield (94%) compared to Ni/C-Mo0.2 and Ni/C-Mo0.6 was obtained (Table 1, entries 5–7). The significantly higher selectivity for CPL obtained using the NiMo-based catalyst is most likely due to addition of element Mo to Ni/CNT catalyst reducing the surface Ni crystallite size and providing higher active phase dispersions (Fig. 5). In addition, different types of Mo-doped Ni containing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) was synthesized and applied in hydrogenation of FFA to CPL in liquid phase. The yield of CPL followed the order: Ni/C-Mo-BTC > Ni/C-Mo-DHTA > Ni/C-Mo-PTA (Table 1, entries 7–9). In addition, Ni/C-Mo-BTC showed a better spherical structure while Ni/C-Mo-DHTA and Ni/C-Mo-PTA showed an irregular morphology and structure. The SEM imaged could be seen in Fig. S3. Thus, we selected Ni/C-Mo-BTC as an optimal catalyst in subsequent experiments. On the other hand, different Ni/C-M0.2 catalysts (i.e., Ni/C-Zn0.2, Ni/C-Fe0.2, Ni/C-Cu0.2 and Ni/C-Ce0.2) were synthesized to investigate the catalytic performance during the hydrogenation of FFA to CPL under the conditions employed. The Ni/C-Fe0.2 and Ni/C-Cu0.2 achieved significantly lower CPL selectivity compared to other bimetallic catalysts (17% and 3% respectively). The significantly lower selectivity for CPL obtained using the Ni/C-Fe0.2 and Ni/C-Ce0.2 catalyst was most likely due to a relatively high amount of formation of the hydrogenation product (THFOL) instead of CPL (Table 1, entries 10 and 13). For Ni/C-Zn0.2 and Ni/C-Cu0.2 catalysts generated 56% and 64% main product CPL respectively, which including recovered FFA and small amount of FOL. The result indicated that Ni/C-Zn0.2 and Ni/C-Cu0.2 showed a moderate catalytic performance. These findings were in good agreement with the results obtained by Zhou et. al. for the hydrogenation of FFA over a NiMo/CNT catalyst [35]. It was surprising to find that Ni/C-Mo0.4 catalyst was the most suitable catalyst to yield 94% CPL and the CPL's yield ranking was Ni/C-Mo0.4 > other Ni/C-M catalysts (Table 1). The calculated TOF value of CPL was as high as 104 min−1 (Fig S4), and the reaction rate was 1.92 mmol/gcat*min (Table S3). While FFA hydrogenation was carried out over different Ni/C-M catalysts, the selectivity of CPL was low. The calculated TOF value of CPL was only 53 min−1 (Table S3). Based on the above experimental results, it could easily come to a summary that the combination of Ni and Mo over porous carbon matrix played a significant role in the transformation of FFA to generate CPL in aqueous medium. The effect of catalyst concentration, H2 pressure, reaction time and reaction temperature on the conversion of FFA to yield COL was investigated in aqueous medium over Ni/C-Mo-BTC catalyst, and the results could be seen in the following Fig. 9 and Fig. 10."
8,Effect of catalyst amount,"3.2 Effect of catalyst amount The catalyst amount influence on product distribution over Ni/C-Mo0.4 catalyst was studied and the results are showed in Fig. 1 ., 5 mg to 20 mg Ni/C-Mo0.4 catalyst was carried out under the following reaction conditions: 140 °C, 2 MPa H2 and 2 h. it could be clearly seen that complete conversion of FFA was obtained using Ni/C-Mo0.4 as catalyst. The yield of CPL increased from 52% to 95% when the amount of catalyst increased from 5 mg to 20 mg with the highest yield of CPL (95%) obtained when the amount of Ni/C-Mo0.4 was 10 mg. When the amount of catalyst increased over 10 mg, the yield of CPL detected was kept at the highest point (95%). The low yield of CPL detected with lower amount of Ni/C-Mo0.4 was most likely FOL being generated at the first step and that a significant proportion of the FFA generated underwent hydrogenation forming FOL, resulting few amount CPO and CPL was observed in the reaction."
9,"Effect of reaction time, reaction temperature, H2 pressure and solvent","3.3 Effect of reaction time, reaction temperature, H2 pressure and solvent The reaction time and temperature influence for the generation of CPL over the Ni/C-Mo0.4 catalyst was investigated and the results are shown in Fig. 2 a-b. When FFA hydrogenation was carried out under 140 °C over Ni/C-Mo0.4 catalyst, the conversion of FFA progressively increased when the reaction time increased from 1 to 2 h, and FFA could almost selectively transfer to CPL at 140 °C within a reaction time of 2 h (Fig. 2a). With the increase of reaction time, the yield of CPL will not decrease. Therefore, CPL was relatively stable to under Ni/C-Mo0.4 catalytic system. The influence of temperature was studied in the range of 120 to 160 °C with an interval of 20 °C using the Ni/C-Mo0.4 catalyst and the results for these results were showed in Fig. 2b. Complete transformation of FFA and a high yield (95%) of CPL were achieved over 140 °C. The effect of H2 pressure on the conversion of FFA as well as selectivity of CPL was studied by changing the H2 pressure from 1 MPa to 3 MPa (Fig. 2c). The hydrogenation of FFA to THFOL and further rearrangement to CPL was highly affected by the H2 pressure. The conversion of FFA was observed to increase sharply with increasing H2 pressure from 1 MPa to 2 MPa. And the highest yield of CPL was achieved around 95%. And when the H2 pressure increased from 2 MPa to 3 MPa, no significant change was observed on the yield of CPL, indicating that THFAL underwent dehydration and a rearrangement process in aqueous medium and CPL was rather stable in the Ni/C-Mo0.4 catalytic system. The phenomenon was similar to what was observed in the previous report that THFAL is not stable to dehydration and rearrangement to obtain desired products under the higher H2 pressure [42]. In the end, the influence of solvent on the transformation of FFA as well as selectivity to CPL was investigated by using H-donner solvent (iPrOH, methanol and water) and other solvent (Fig. 2d). In comparison with iPrOH, methanol and water and n-hexane, we found the conversion of FFA and the yield of CPL were both the best when H2O was selected as solvent, while iPrOH and methanol could only achieve an excellent conversion of FFA with a poor selectivity of CPL. When n-hexane was used as solvent, it failed to transfer FFA to desired products (Fig. 2d). The results confirmed a conclusion that H2O was believed to be the best solvent in terms of both FFA conversion and high CPL selectivity. Through the screening of catalyst amount, reaction time, reaction temperature, H2 pressure and solvent of FFA hydrogenation with Ni/C-Mo0.4 catalyst, it could easily find the optimal reaction condition: 10 mg Ni/C-Mo0.4 catalyst, 2 h, 140 °C, 2 MPa H2, 10 mL water as solvent."
10,Scope of the substrates and mechanism of FFA hydrogenation,"In order to continue the exploration of the Ni/C-Mo0.4 catalytic activity, four FFA derivates were chosen as model compounds under the optimal conditions. It could be clearly seen in Table 2 that, the main products in Table 1 entries 1–2 were rearrangement products, suggesting the occurrence of hydrogenation and rearrangement of FFA derivates. Above all, substrates without any substituted groups on the FFA ring could achieve a 100% conversion rate, to give 95% of CPL (Table 2 entry 1). When 1-(furan-2-yl)ethan-1-one was used as substrate, 2-methylcyclopentan-1-ol was obtained in 88% yield (Table 2 entry 2). However, when 5-methylfuran-2-carbaldehyde and 5-(hydroxymethyl)furan-2-carbaldehyde were used as substrates, the rearrangement reaction of the furan ring could not occur (Table 2, entries 3 and 4). The dominate reason for this phenomenon was similar to previous report, which indicated that Lewis acid sites were not favorable for the rearrangement of 5-substituted furan derivatives [48]. It was of great significance to understand the pathway for the hydrogenation and rearrangement of FFA to obtain CPL. Generally, FFA was firstly converted into FOL via C = O hydrogenation under hydrogen atmosphere. Then two possible routes occurred in Fig. 3 (hydrogenation of unsaturated double bond to generate THFOL and rearrange of FFA ring to obtain CPL). In the first possible route, with excess H2 pressure, FOL was easily transferred to THFOL. Large amount of THFOL was produced in iPrOH and methanol with small amount of CPL, which could be clearly seen in Fig. 2d. On the other hand, FFA was firstly hydrogenated to FOL catalyzed by Ni/C-Mo catalysts, and then rearrangement of FOL into HCP occurred spontaneously in aqueous medium, which was independent of catalytic hydrogenation. Subsequently HCP was converted into CPO over Ni/C-Mo catalysts, and finally CPL was produced via C = O hydrogenation of CPO. Water and higher temperature were needed in our Ni/C-Mo catalytic system, which also verified why the yield of CPL was low at lower temperature (Fig. 2b) or in other solvent (Fig. 2d). It could result in the unwilled compound THFOL that contained one oxygen atom within the ring structure. Meanwhile, the swift transformation of HCP and CPO under Ni/C-Mo catalytic system might be the obstacle for their detection in GC/MS. In general, water was not only used as solvent, but also indispensable in the rearrangement of FOL into HCP. According to previous literature [49], When 18O-enriched water was employed in the reaction, 95% abundance of 18O was detected in CPO. Therefore, the O element in CPO was from water. Additionally, kinetic experiments were performed by Yang, secondary kinetic deuterium isotope effects were observed in heavy water, indicating that water was involved in the rearrangement reaction as a reactant. Based on the research above, it was not difficult to find that the opening and closure of a furan ring were related to the attack of a H2O molecule in the 5-position. In the end, the recyclability of Ni/C-Mo catalyst was investigated. After a simple process (simple washing with iPrOH and dried under 100 °C), Ni/C-Mo catalyst could be carried out in the next test directly. As was showed in Fig. 4 , the as-prepared catalyst could be reused up to five times without losing its activity. Additionally, Ni/C-Mo catalyst could also be magnetically recovered, which could be seen in Fig. S2. The ICP result of Ni/C and different ratio Ni/C-Mo catalysts could be seen in Table S2. In addition, used Ni/C-Mo0.4 catalyst showed a slight Ni and Mo leaching, which led a decrease of FFA hydrogenation to produce CPL in aqueous medium."
11,Results and discussion,"Above all, the properties of Ni-based catalyst were investigated by the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), with Fig. 5 illustrating the XRD spectra of Ni/C catalyst and different Ni/C-Mo, Ni/C-Fe, Ni/C-Zn, Ni/C-Cu and Ni/C-Ce, catalysts. XRD spectra of Ni/C catalyst and different Ni/C-Mo, Ni/C-Fe, Ni/C-Zn, Ni/C-Cu and Ni/C-Ce catalysts before calcination at 500 °C were included in Fig. S1. Uncalcined samples exhibited clearly complex diffraction lines. Comparatively, calcined catalysts exhibited unique diffraction lines. As we could clearly see in Fig. 5, the diffraction peaks marked with ‘#’ can be easily assigned to (006) and (113) planes of Rhombohedra (RH) Ni3C (JCPDS no. 06-0697) [39–40], whereas the diffraction peaks at 44.5°, 51.9°, and 76.4° marked with the black snowflake could be assigned to the diffraction of the (111), (200), and (220) planes of metallic Ni [41], indicating that metallic nickel species were observed in Ni/C catalyst. In addition, small amount of NiCx was detected in Ni/C catalyst. Metallic nickel species were observed in all calcined Ni-based catalysts. With the increase of Mo loading amount, two typical diffraction peaks of Mo4O11, located at 2θ = 26.1 and 37.2 could be hardly observed for Ni/C-Mo0.6 catalyst, suggesting that extremely small and well-dispersed Mo particles were present [42]. In Ni/C-Fe0.2 and Ni/C-Cu0.2 catalysts, only metallic nickel species were observed. In Ni/C-Zn0.2 and Ni/C-Ce0.2 catalysts, Ni3ZnC0.7 and CeO2 was detected. The morphology and structure of Ni-MOF and different Ni-based MOF catalysts were characterized by SEM. Ni-MOF catalyst maintained spherical morphology before calcination. The result was similar to our previous study [43]. It was clear that all Ni-based MOF catalysts including Ni-MOF-Mo0.2, Ni-MOF-Mo0.4, Ni-MOF-Mo0.6, Ni-MOF-Fe0.2, Ni-MOF-Zn0.2, Ni-MOF-Cu0.2 and Ni-MOF-Ce0.2 exhibited similar shapes with each other. As we could see from Fig. 6 , all NiMo-based samples had a three-dimensional (3D) spherical morphology, and the size of a single particle was about 5–10 μm. In comparison with the morphology of Ni-MOF with Ni-MOF-Mo catalyst (Fig. 6a–d), we found that the spherical structure became irregular gradually with the addition of Mo in the bimetallic MOF precursor. Especially in Ni-MOF-Mo0.6 catalyst, the spherical structure has been completely destroyed. The same phenomenon was observed when Fe, Zn, Cu and Ce was introduced in Ni-MOF catalyst, which indicated that spherical structure could only be maintained in mono-metallic Ni-MOF catalyst. The morphology and structure of calcined Ni-MOF and different Ni-based MOF catalysts were also characterized by SEM, and the results were showed in Fig. 7 . It was clear that Ni/C catalyst maintained the spherical morphology before and after calcination. As we could see from Fig. 7, all NiMo-based samples had a three-dimensional (3D) irregular spherical morphology, and the size of a single particle was around 10 mm. In addition, Mo/C also showed a three-dimensional (3D) irregular spherical morphology, which could be seen in Fig. S4. Comparing the particle size of Ni/C catalysts (Fig. 7-a), we could find that the particle size of the irregular spherical structure became lager gradually with the addition of Mo in the bimetallic catalysts. The morphological evolution described above could be owing to the competition between Ni and Mo during the growth of the Ni/C-Mo catalyst. When Fe, Zn, Cu and Ce were introduced to Ni-based catalyst, all Ni-based bimetallic catalysts had a three-dimensional (3D) irregular morphology, and the size of a single particle was all over 10 mm, which resulted in a poor conversion and selectivity to corresponding products. In addition, the results of EDX elemental mapping of Ni/C-Mo0.4, Ni/C-Fe0.2, Ni/C-Zn0.2, Ni/C-Cu0.2 and Ni/C-Ce0.2 indicated that the Ni and other added metal elements were evenly distributed in the sample as shown in Fig. 8 . The effect of Mo on Ni dispersion was also analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 9a–h showed the TEM micrographs of Ni/C, Ni/C-Mo0.2, Ni/C-Mo0.4, Ni/C-Mo0.6, Ni/C-Fe0.2, Ni/C-Zn0.2, Ni/C-Cu0.2 and Ni/C-Ce0.2 catalysts, respectively. We could clearly see that Ni has better dispersion with the doping of Mo ions in Ni/C-Mo catalyst. It was consistent with the result in the elemental mapping. When other metals (Fe, Zn, Cu and Ce) were introduced to the Ni-based catalyst, it also showed a better dispersion in Fig. 9e–h. In summary, the TEM results confirmed that the introduction of Mo could increase the dispersion, which was very consistent with the XRD results in Fig. 9. According to the results in Table S2, we found that the BET surface area of bimetallic Ni/C-Mo catalysts were relatively larger than Ni/C (152.59 m2 /g, 159.66 m2 /g and 162.32 m2 /g respectively), indicating that the introduction of Mo in Ni based catalysts could not only help to improve the dispersion of metal particles, but also contribute to restraining the aggregation of Ni/Mo particles during the preparation. In addition, the pore volume also increased to some extent after the addition of element Mo in Ni based catalysts. The acidity of Ni/C and other Ni-based catalysts were investigated by NH3-TPD as shown in Fig. 10. We could find that the Ni/C catalyst showed a broad NH3 desorption peak at 369 °C, suggesting the presence of medium strong acid sites. Ni/C-Mo0.2, Ni/C-Mo0.4 and Ni/C-Mo0.6 catalysts exhibited one NH3 desorption peak at around 500 °C, indicating the presence of strong acid site. Herein, we could draw the conclusion that the introduction of the Mo element could obviously increase the catalyst acidity compared to that of the single Ni based catalyst. The acidity of Ni/C catalyst and different ratio Ni/C-Mo catalysts could be seen in Table S1 that Ni/C-Mo0.6 showed a higher content of acidity which Ni/C catalyst showed 0.5704 mmol/g acidity. Ni/C-Fe0.2 catalyst exhibited two NH3 desorption peaks at 320 °C and 520 °C, indicating the presence of both medium and strong acid sites. Ni/C-Zn0.2 catalyst exhibited one NH3 desorption peaks at 305 °C, indicating the presence of medium strong acid site. Ni/C-Cu0.2 catalyst exhibited one NH3 desorption peaks at 430 °C, suggesting the presence of strong acid site. Ni/C-Ce0.2 catalyst exhibited two NH3 desorption peaks at 300 °C and 391 °C, suggesting the presence of medium strong acid sites. In Fig. 11 , Raman spectroscopy showed the result of Ni/C-Mo0.2, Ni/C-Mo0.4, Ni/C-Mo0.6, Ni/C-Fe0.2, Ni/C-Zn0.2, Ni/C-Cu0.2 and Ni/C-Ce0.2. All samples showed the characteristic carbon peaks located at 1340 and 1600 cm−1, corresponding to the D and G bands of graphitized carbon. D/G peak intensity ratio (ID/IG) was known to be an indicator of the graphitization, where a smaller ID/IG ratio indicated a higher graphitization [44]. It could be clearly seen that the ID/IG values of Ni/C-Mo0.4, Ni/C-Mo0.4, Ni/C-Cu0.2 and Ni/C-Ce0.2 were 0.95, 1.13, 0.98, 0.99 respectively. The result indicated an ordered structure of carbon atoms and improved graphitization. The higher graphitization degree of the carbon phase was probably owing to the addition of Mo metal, and characteristic carbon peaks located at 1340 and 1600 cm−1 corresponding to the D and G bands of graphitized carbon were disappeared in Ni/C-Mo0.6. The same phenomenon was observed in Ni/C-Fe0.2, Ni/C-Zn0.2. Hence, Ni/C-Mo0.4 catalyst had high efficiency and was beneficial for the hydrogenolysis of FFA. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed to determine the chemical composition of Ni/C-Mo0.4 catalyst. Fig. 12 -a depicted the XPS survey spectra of Ni/C-Mo0.4, proving the presence of C, O, Mo and Ni in the nanocomposite. Fig. 8b-d showed the corresponding high resolution spectra of the C1s, Mo3d and Ni2p orbitals. In C1s spectra (Fig. 12-b), it showed three distinct peaks at 284.70 eV, 285.50 eV and 288.05 eV corresponding to C-C, C-O, and O = C, respectively [45]. For Mo3d spectra (Fig. 12-c), the peak at 232.80 eV and 229.80 eV were attributed to Mo0 in Ni/C-Mo0.4. And the peak at 236.20 eV was attributed to Mo oxide in Ni/C-Mo0.4, which was associated to Mo3d/2 [46]. The binding energies at 852.90 and 856.30 eV were observed for Ni/C-Mo0.4 (Fig. 12-d), which corresponded to Ni0 (2p 3/2) and Ni2+(2p3/2), respectively. The binding energies at 872.30 and 874.80 eV corresponded to the main lines of Ni0 (2p 1/2) and Ni2+ (2p 1/2). It could be found that part of metallic Ni was oxidized before or during the XPS testing, which contributed to the understanding of oxide nickel detection in the XPS spectra. The other peaks were satellite peaks [47]. The XPS results demonstrated the successful formation of Ni/C-Mo0.4 catalyst."
12,Conclusion,"To explore the efficiency of Ni and Mo in Ni/C-Mo catalysts, various Ni-MOF based catalysts were synthesized using the different compositions and metal source. We described a mild and efficient strategy, which proceeded through the hydrogenolysis of FFA. The Ni/C-Mo catalyst not only exhibited the perfect ability to the rearrangement of FOL into CPL, employing water as solvent, but also could be easily recovered magnetically from the reaction process for the next five recycling runs. The Ni/C-Mo catalyst also showed an excellent ability to catalyze various FFA derivates under the optimal reaction condition. The mechanisms for the hydrogenolysis of FFA was also explored and proposed over Ni/C-Mo in water in the presence of H2, suggesting that the hydrogenation process happened in four consecutive steps: FFA was firstly hydrogenated to FOL catalyzed by Ni/C-Mo catalysts, and then rearrangement of FOL into HCP occurred spontaneously in aqueous medium, and then subsequently HCP was converted into CPO over Ni/C-Mo catalysts, and finally CPL was produced via C = O hydrogenation of CPO. It also indicated that water and higher temperature were essential in our Ni/C-Mo catalytic system. Hence, this study provided new insights into the design and manufacture of highly effective MOF catalysts for efficient hydrogenolysis of FFA to CPL, which could also be employed in other field in the future."
