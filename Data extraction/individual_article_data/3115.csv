0,Introduction,"The upgrading of biomass derivatives to biofuels and chemicals typically requires the reduction of high oxygen content [1]. While direct hydrogenation using H2 can be an effective catalytic route, the use of milder conditions using transfer hydrogenation (TH) from H2-donors is proving increasingly attractive for valorization of biomass. In addition to more modest infrastructure requirements for processing, TH provides a way to potentially source H2 from other renewable sources in a single process. Furthermore, in contrast to direct hydrogenation, TH can provide selectivity for C=O over C=C bonds [2]. In recent years significant progress has been made towards the development of TH strategies for biomass-derived substrates using both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts [3]. The most commonly employed H2-donors are 2-propanol and formic acid, although the use of renewably sourced alcohols, such as ethanol and glycerol, is also gaining interest [2,4–8]. While the most efficient methods to advance TH in organic synthesis are promoted by organometallic catalysts, it is challenging to utilize transition metal complexes in aqueous media, which are required for many biomass applications, due to the lability of the ligands in water and low solubility of the complexes. An attractive methodology that has been recently gaining momentum in order to circumvent this challenge is the use of robust NHC ligands functionalized with ionizable groups that enhance stability and hydrophilicity of the complex [9]. One biomass-derived platform chemical that has proven to be a challenging substrate for hydrogenation is levulinic acid (LA). LA can be obtained from starch and cellulose through hydrolysis to hexoses, such as glucose and fructose, with subsequent dehydration to HMF and rehydration to formic and LA [10,11]. Chemical conversion of LA to levulinate esters, γ-hydroxyvaleric acid (GHV), γ-valerolactone (GVL), acrylic acid, 1,4-pentadiol, angelica lactone and δ-aminolevulinic acid (DALA) are just some of the derivatizations explored to-date for further valorizing this platform chemical [12]. Hydrogenation of LA is expected to yield γ-hydroxyvaleric acid (GHV); however, under most experimental conditions reported, the final product is γ-valerolactone (GVL), which is formed via an intermolecular esterification, either prior to or subsequent to hydrogenation (Scheme 1 ). This is true both for direct hydrogenation [8,13–26], as well as transfer hydrogenation, even in the presence of base. Basic conditions are expected to suppress esterification, affording GHV as the final product. It is feasible that the predominant focus in the literature on generation of GVL rather than GHV is the result of the potential applications of GVL as a fuel additive and green solvent [27–34]. However, new applications for GHV are making it into an attractive target in itself: specifically, GHV can be used in the synthesis of poly(hydroxyalkanoate) (PHA) polymers, which are not only biodegradable, but also have more favorable lifecycle environmental impact than polyolefins [35]. Most commonly, GHV can be copolymerized with 3-hydroxybutyric acid to produce biodegradable co-polymers with controllable material properties, but other PHAs based on GHV can also readily be envisioned. In addition to its application as a monomer, GHV is also a versatile synthetic building block for further functionalization. In order to contextualize the process reported herein, we offer comparison to reported methods for TH of LA to yield GVL (methods that exclusively afford GHV have not been reported to the best of our knowledge). The most common are methods that utilize formic acid as H2-donor, using Au, Ru, Ag, Pd, Rh and Ir catalysts [36–42]. Although formic acid can be derived from the same process as LA, its corrosive character has limited some applications. The use of alcohols as H2-donors via transfer hydrogenation has also been explored primarily with heterogeneous catalysts, such as RANEY® Ni [43], ZrO2 [44], ZrO(OH)2 [45], Zr-beta zeolites [46,47], Zr-HBA [48], porous zirconium-phytic acid hybrid [48], Zr coordination polymers [49], and immobilized Zr(IV)-Schiff base complexes [50]. Carbon-supported Pd [51] and Ru [62] have also been shown to effectively catalyze the reaction with 2-propanol and ethanol using microwave heating; in the case of the Ru/C [62], without a need for base. The only homogeneous example of TH of LA using alcohols as H2-donor is from Williams et al., who showed that a Ru phosphine complex can afford ∼40 turnovers (TON) in 24 h (Fig. 1 ) [62]. The efficiencies of the most comparable catalytic systems for this process, albeit with a different H2-source, are summarized in Fig. 1, with a full list available in the ESI-Fig. S1. The key challenges that remains to be overcome are low catalyst activity or stability (low TONs), the need to esterify LA as the alkyl levulinate before hydrogenation [8], and the expansion of H2 sources to alcohols derived from renewables. Thus, the development of efficient and robust catalysts for LA transfer hydrogenation using renewable alcohols as H2-donor and directly from LA is highly desirable. Two alcohols that can be sourced renewably are glycerol and ethanol. Due to recent exploitation of fatty acids for biodiesel synthesis, glycerol production from biodiesel synthesis has surpassed market demand. One of the attractive routes to glycerol valorization has been as an effective H2-donor [5,53]. Glycerol dehydrogenation ultimately affords lactic acid under basic conditions [54–56], which is in itself a value-added product. In addition, we have recently shown that the conversion of glycerol to lactic acid is highly thermodynamically favorable under basic conditions (ΔG = −105.7 kcal/mol with G3B3, PCM water, see ESI Table S6) and can thus be used to drive hydrogenation of challenging substrates. In the search for highly prolific catalysts for the acceptorless dehydrogenation of glycerol, we have identified water-soluble Ir and Ru N-heterocyclic carbene organometallic catalysts (NHCs) have significant advantages over less hydrophilic catalysts, reaching turnover frequencies (TOF) of over 40,000 h-1 [54]. We proposed that the latter class of catalysts can facilitate efficient TH of biomass substrates in aqueous media, such as 15–30 wt% H2O:GVL used by Dumesic and Horvath. [34, 58–59] Here we report the first TH of levulinic acid from glycerol in a highly efficient and selective process under mild conditions, which forms two value-added products: GHV and lactic acid. GHV can be readily transformed to GVL via acidification. The catalyst is also efficient with ethanol as H2-donor, another alcohol that can be sourced renewably."

2,Synthetic procedures for ligands and catalysts,"2.1 Synthetic procedures for ligands and catalysts Ligand precursors (2,6-bis(1-imidazolyl)pyridine, 1,1′-methylenebis[imidazole] and 2-(Imidazole-1-yl)pyridine were synthesized by previously reported methods [54]. Ruthenium compounds 1 and 5 were prepared by silver transmetalation from the corresponding imidazolium salts [60]. Iridium compounds 2 – 4 were synthesized by direct metalation using [Ir(cod)OMe]2, as previously described by us [54]. Catalyst synthesis and characterization are detailed in the ESI."
3,Experimental procedures for transfer hydrogenation,"2.2 Experimental procedures for transfer hydrogenation 2.2.1 General procedure for transfer hydrogenation reactions using microwave heating A 10-mL microwave tube was charged with a magnetic stir bar, 0.4612 g glycerol (0.366 mL, 5.00 mmol), 0.286 mL aqueous KOH (14 M, 4.00 mmol), 0.0474 g levulinic acid (0.408 mmol), 0.0362 μmol catalyst (50 μL of 0.724 mM aqueous solution, < 0.01 mol% w.r.t. levulinic acid) and 1.30 mL DI water. The resulting solution had a glycerol concentration of 2.5 M, KOH concentration of 2.0 M, potassium levulinate concentration of 0.20 M and [Ir] catalyst concentration of 0.0181 mM. The sealed vial was flushed with nitrogen, but air was not stringently excluded using Schlenk technique. The reaction mixture was thoroughly stirred to ensure adequate mixing and then placed in the cavity of an Anton Parr Monowave or CEM Discover microwave reactors. The mixture was heated with 200 W power (maximum pressure set to 250 psi) to 150 °C, or as indicated. The desired temperature was reached in less than 1 min on average, and was held for 2 h (unless otherwise indicated). After cooling to room temperature product and reactant concentrations were quantitated by NMR based on this external standard and by HPLC, as detailed in 2.2.3. 2.2.2 General procedure for transfer hydrogenation reactions using conventional heating For reactions performed using conventional heating, the same procedure was followed, but using 20-mL reaction tubes that were placed in a Radleys Carousel 12 Reaction Station, and heated to 150 °C (temperature of reaction block probe) for 24 h. The reactions were flushed with nitrogen, but air was not stringently excluded using Schlenk technique. 2.2.3 Product characterization Reaction aliquots were analyzed by HPLC and NMR. HPLC was performed using a Shimadzu Prominence-i (LC-2030C 3D) instrument equipped with a PDA detector and an RI detector using a mobile phase of 0.005 M H2SO4 with a flow rate of 0.44 mL/min at 35 °C. Samples were prepared by adding 1-mL of the sample to 0.22 mL of 5 M H2SO4 and filtering through a syringe filter. The PDA detector scanned the range of 190–800 nm, affording traces at 190, 218, 254, and 284 nm for analysis. For NMR analysis, a 0.100-mL aliquot of reaction solution was mixed with equal volume of standard solution of 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid sodium salt (TSP) and 0.5 mL D2O. A comparison was made with reactions in which the TSP standard was added at the beginning of reaction, rather than to each aliquot, and no major differences were observed."
4,Results,
5,Catalyst design and synthesis,"3.1 Catalyst design and synthesis Catalyst design was guided by the following considerations. The selection of organometallic (i.e. homogeneous), rather than heterogeneous catalysts, is intended to capitalize on the ability to tune ligand architecture in order to optimize activity and selectivity for this challenging reaction. Given that the optimized catalyst is intended to subsequently be heterogenized as a robust, single-site heterogeneous catalysts, the ultimate utility of the heterogeneous catalyst will minimize consumption of the precious metals. The choice of Ir and Ru species is based on evidence that complexes of these metals can have high activity for transfer hydrogenation, especially from glycerol as H2-donor (there is only one homogeneous example of TH of LA from alcohols [62], and Ir complexes have been previously shown to be effective for TH of carbonyls from glycerol [53,61]). N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) were selected as ligands based on their stability in aqueous media and their thermally-robust nature, which are critical given that the TH reactions from glycerol typically require reaction temperatures above 120 °C [61] and aqueous conditions. Furthermore, we expect that more thermally robust catalysts will have a significant advantage in catalyst lifetime under microwave conditions, where superheating can cause hotspots. Finally, the use of ionizable sulfonate functionalization of the NHCs is guided by the need to increase the hydrophilicity of the complexes so as to render them soluble in the aqueous glycerol media. We have previously found the latter to be an important design criterion for catalysts used in TH of biomass-derived substrates, significantly enhancing activity compared to catalyst precursors lacking the ionizable groups [54]. Furthermore, this functionalization is compatible with the linker groups required to subsequently immobilize the complexes onto supports. We previously reported the high activity of compounds 1 – 5 , bearing alkyl- and arylsulfonate-functionalized NHCs (Chart 1 ), for glycerol dehydrogenation [54]. The synthesis and transfer hydrogenation activity from glycerol of iridium compound 2 was previously reported by Peris et al. [70,71] Ruthenium compounds 1 and 5 were prepared by silver transmetalation from the corresponding imidazolium salts [60]. Compounds 2 – 4 were synthesized by direct metalation using [Ir(cod)OMe]2, as previously described by us [54]."
6,Glycerol as H2-donor,"3.2 Glycerol as H2-donor TH of levulinic acid (LA) is expected to proceed according to Scheme 2 , where the initial dehydrogenation product of glycerol (dihydroxyacetone or glyceraldehyde) is rapidly converted to lactate under basic conditions via dehydration and intramolecular Cannizzaro reaction [2]. The hydrogen is transferred to levulinate to afford GHV. Despite attempts to identify the intermediates to lactic acid involved in this process (dihydroxyacetone, glyceraldehyde and pyruvaldehyde), none of these have been observed under reaction conditions. We can thus only assert that the intermediates formed is highly reactive under basic conditions. The reporting of lactic acid formation, in addition to that of GHV, is important for the following reasons. First, lactic acid is a value-added byproduct from the TH using glycerol, and thus the value of lactic acid would likely be part of the economic rationale for using glycerol in TH of biomass substrates. Furthermore, since lactic acid is formed in a multi-step process (catalytic dehydrogenation to form DHA or glyceraldehyde, followed by base-promoted reactions leading to lactate), it is important to state whether TH reactions using glycerol form a full equivalent of lactate as by-products. Second, some of the catalysts for TH of glycerol also facilitate the acceptorless dehydrogenation (AD) of glycerol to DHA or glyceraldehyde, which under basic conditions rapidly form lactic acid. The AD competes with TH, and for some catalysts, the latter process is faster. As a result, some catalysts form lactic acid in excess of the desired hydrogenation product (in this case, GHV). In addition to the relative rates of AD vs TH being dependent on the catalyst, they also have distinct temperature-dependence and base concentration dependence, as we previously detailed in the case of TH of CO2 from glycerol [61]. In the reaction described here, we thus quantitate both GHV and lactic acid at different temperatures, and using different base conditions (concentration and type of base). In order to identify optimal reaction conditions, catalytic activity of 4 was explored at different temperatures, base concentrations and solvent ratios (Figs. 2 and 3 ). Water was added as a co-solvent to decrease the viscosity of glycerol and improve mass transfer of base. For speed of optimization, the reactions were carried out using microwave heating for 2 h. Reactions without base gave no conversion of LA and negligible lactic acid formation, which was expected, given that both the glycerol dehydrogenation and the subsequent conversion to lactic acid require base (Fig. 2, ESI Table S1). In the absence of base, when the reaction is under acidic conditions, we observe only ketals and negligible concentrations (<5%) of the levulinate esters. As KOH concentration is increased, the concentrations of GHV and lactic acid increase correspondingly. The need for excess base relative to levulinic acid is not surprising, given that one equivalent of base is consumed by LA to form the levulinate salt, and additional base is needed to convert the primary dehydrogenation product of glycerol to the lactate salt. KOH concentration of ∼2 M affords full conversion of LA with quantitative selectivity for GHV (12,260 TON). Under these conditions, the concentration of lactic acid is 2–3 times greater than that of GHV (equivalent to 23,660 TON). The yield of lactic acid from glycerol in this reaction is ∼17% (initial molar ratio of glycerol:LA is ∼12.5). The quantity of lactic acid produced exceeds that of GHV, even at lower base concentrations: for example, at 0.4 M KOH we observe 518 and 1,710 turnovers of GHV and lactic acid respectively. This is consistent with our previous reports on TH of CO2 form glycerol, which suggest that TH from glycerol competes with acceptorless dehydrogenation, and is related to base concentration [8]. Thus, as KOH concentration is increased beyond 2 M, the TONs with respect to lactic acid generation also increase. We briefly explored the effect of substituting KOH with other hydroxide and carbonate bases (Fig. 3 and ESI Table S2). Sodium hydroxide afforded slightly lower yield and TON of GVL compared to potassium hydroxide (95% yield, 11,620 TON). Both carbonate bases tested afforded lower yields than the hydroxides, with potassium carbonate performing better than sodium carbonate (31% vs 15% yields of GHV respectively). In the reactions with carbonate base small amounts of formate were also observed, arising from TH of carbonate to formate, as previously reported by us [61]. The reaction is quite sensitive to temperature: below 100 °C the TONs with respect to both GHV and lactic acid are relatively low (1,260 and 2,310 TONs respectively in 2 h). At 120 °C, the concentrations of GHV and LA produced are equal after 2 h (8,090 and 8,090 TONs respectively, corresponding to 66% yield of GHV). The reaction reaches quantitative yields of GHV at 150 °C (ESI Table S3). At 180 °C the TONs of lactic acid further increase, but the GHV yield decreases as small quantities of methyl-THF, formed by further hydrogenation, are observed. Using the optimized conditions, we compared the activity of catalysts 1 – 5 at a loading of 0.01mol % (Fig. 4 and ESI Table S4). The two Ir(I) bis-NHC catalysts ( 3 and 4 ) showed highest activity, with the carbonyl analog ( 4 ) surpassing the activity of the cyclooctadiene analog ( 3 ) by a factor of ∼2. Catalyst 4 affords quantitative conversion of 0.2 M potassium levulinate in 2 h (TOFs of 6,130 and 11,830 h-1 for GHV and lactic acid respectively). In comparison, the Ir(III) bis-NHC catalyst, 2 , was approximately 5-fold less active. The two Ru(II) NHC compounds ( 1 and 5 ) showed lower activity than the iridium compounds. To determine whether the catalyst loading could be further reduced, we increased the concentration of LA 10-fold to 2 M, and [KOH] to 4 M, with a corresponding 10-fold reduction of catalyst loading to 0.001 mol%. Under these conditions we obtained 66% GHV yield in 1 h (66,700 TONs) and near-quantitative conversion after 2 h (101,000 TONs) using microwave heating, suggesting that catalyst loading can be successfully reduced. The rate of the reaction using catalyst 4 was also compared using conventional heating. The time needed to reach quantitative yield using conventional heating was significantly longer than that using microwave heating (24 h vs. 2 h). This difference is likely due to (i) the lower accuracy in controlling reaction temperature using conventional heating in a sealed tube vs microwave heating; and (ii) the higher efficiency of microwave heating vs conventional heating of aqueous glycerol, resulting in improved mass transfer of base. The trend is consistent with our previous reports on the relative rates of glycerol dehydrogenation under aqueous conditions [54], and with recent reports of GVL transfer hydrogenation being accelerated by microwave heating [51,62]. The most active catalyst, 4, was the one previously identified by us as most prolific for glycerol dehydrogenation; in fact, the relative activity of catalysts 1 – 5 for TH of LA follows the same trend as that we previously observed for acceptorless dehydrogenation of glycerol [54]. The two ruthenium NHC catalysts ( 1 and 5 ) were significantly less active than the iridium NHC catalysts ( 2 – 4 ). Ru catalyst 1 , which differs from 5 by a propylsulfonate imidazolium moiety substituted on the pyridine, affords only a modest improvement of activity compared to 5 . Although further optimization of the ligand architecture around the ruthenium is likely to result in improvements of catalytic activity, in light of the significantly higher activity observed with iridium catalysts, we did not pursue further optimization of ruthenium complexes. Among the iridium catalysts, the Ir(III) compound 2 is significantly less active than the two Ir(I) compounds ( 3 and 4 ). Among the two Ir(I) analogs (dicarbonyl derivative 4 and cod analog 3 ), 4 is significantly more active, surpassing the activity of the 3 by a factor of ∼2. The seminal report by Crabtree et al. on glycerol acceptorless dehydrogenation indicated that substituting the cyclooctadiene (cod) ligand of non-sulfonated Ir(I) complexes with carbonyls afforded an increase in glycerol dehydrogenation activity [69]. We thus prepared the corresponding dicarbonyl complex 4 by passing CO gas through a solution of compound 3 . Indeed, we find that 4 is significantly more active for both transfer hydrogenation activity of LA (Fig. 4), as well as for acceptprless dehydrogenation of glycerol; the latter was reported by us previously [54]. We postulate that the difference in activity observed for 3 and 4 in the TH reaction could be due to more favorable insertion into Ir-H of the levulinic acid carbonyl due to the effect of strong π-acceptor (CO) ligands. However, as discussed in the subsequent paragraph, the presence of the carbonyl ligands likely results in a significantly different mechanism for glycerol activation in 3 vs 4 . Given that Ir(III) complex 2 differs from 3 and 4 in both the oxidation state of iridium and the chelating nature of the bis-NHC ligands, it is not possible to draw direct conclusions about the effect of the higher oxidation state of the catalyst precursor. Attempts to synthesize the chelating Ir(I) analog of 2 failed, likely due to instability of the Ir(I) D4h complex with the small bite angle of the methylene-bridged bis-NHC ligand. However, one can expect that catalyst 2 facilitates the reaction via a distinct mechanism compared to that of the most active dicarbonyl Ir(I) compound, 4. Ir(III) compounds likely undergo ligand substitution by glycerol, base-dependent deprotonation to form Ir-alkoxide, β-hydride elimination and insertion of the carbonyl. [63] As proposed by Xiao et al., a similar mechanism can be used to account for acceptorless alcohol dehydrogenation facilitated by Ir(III) compounds, where instead of carbonyl insertion, hydride abstraction using H+ releases H2. [64] For Ir(I) compound 3 , a similar mechanism is possible because the cyclooctadiene (cod) is highly labile and can be readily substituted by glycerol. However, carbonyls in 4 are not readily labile,[65] and we propose that the 16-electron Ir(I) species instead undergoes O-H oxidative addition with glycerol to form an alkoxy hydride complex; this step has precedents for Ir(I) complexes [66–68]. The resulting Ir(III) alkoxy hydride complex (previously observed by NMR) [54] could more readily dissociate a carbonyl compared to the Ir(I) species, given that expectedly lower bond dissociation energy due to decreased backbonding of the more oxidized metal. The alkoxy glycerol complex subsequently can undergo β-hydride elimination, releasing dihydroxyacetone (DHA) via O-H reductive elimination, and re-forming the Ir(I) species. Unfortunately, DHA is not observed under basic conditions, as it quickly reacts to form lactate, likely via dehydration and intramolecular Cannizzaro reaction [69]. This mechanism is consistent with the fact that no product is observed at 150 °C in the absence of base, which is needed to thermodynamically drive the reaction by conversion of DHA to lactic acid. Given that the reaction forms two products, we attempted, albeit with limited success, to efficiently separate them. Methods explored included selective freezing, extraction with organic solvents and anion and cation exchange resins which may retain the lactate, hydroxide and potassium ions. Unfortunately, none of these afforded clean separation of the products in our hands, partly due to the challenge in separating two carboxylic acids with similar physical properties. We can, however, show that upon acidification of the crude reaction GHV readily converts to GVL, which can be more readily isolated (see ESI Figure S-3)."
7,Activity with other H2-donors,"3.3 Activity with other H2-donors In addition to glycerol, we find that the optimized system is also effective with other H2-donors, such as 2-propanol, potassium formate and ethanol (Fig. 5 , ESI Table S5). For consistency, these reactions were also performed in 1:1 H2-donor:water in closed vessels using microwave heating in order to maintain temperature at 150 °C. Under those conditions the reaction with 2-propanol affords 82% yield of GHV in 2 h, compared to the quantitative yield afforded with glycerol under the same conditions. The lower yield with 2-propanol could be due to the fact that the thermodynamic driving force (Gibbs free energy of reaction, (ΔG°aq) of the reaction with glycerol, which forms lactate after dehydrogenation under basic conditions, is significantly more favorable compared to that from the reaction with 2-propanol (−105 vs −9.7 kcal/mol for glycerol vs 2-propanol dehydrogenation, ESI Table S6). The lower activity with potassium formate (4,650 TON, 38% yield) is due to the fact that under basic conditions the catalyst has low activity for dehydrogenation of formate. Furthermorewe previously reported that the catalyst is in fact active for the reverse reaction – transfer hydrogenation from glycerol of CO2 from glycerol. [61] The activity for dehydrogenation of formic acid increases at lower pH, but the reaction could not be performed at acidic pH under microwave conditions due to the corrosive nature of the acid to the microwave components. Under conventional heating at reflux (∼100 °C) the reaction with formic acid affords 75% yield of GHV in 24 h, demonstrating the potential application of this system to formic acid as H2-donor. The catalyst is also effective with ethanol, a primary alcohol, as H2-donor. Ethanol is an attractive source of hydrogen due to its availability from renewables, but previous reports of LA TH from ethanol over ZrO2-based catalysts at 150 °C documented decreased GHV selectivity due to formation of ethanol by-products (self-condensation products of acetaldehyde and acetaldehyde-LA adducts) [8]. There is only one prior report demonstrating the use of ethanol as H2-donor for TH of LA using microwave pulse heating, but the reaction temperature could not be reported [51]. With the 1:1 ethanol:water mixture catalyst 4 affords 68% of GHV in 2 h (7,580 TONs), and full conversion in 3 h, with small amounts of ethyl acetate and acetaldehyde as by-products from ethanol (ESI Figure S-4). Trace amounts of ethyl levulinate and ketals were also identified by GC-MS. The reaction was also attempted in neat ethanol, and affords comparable yield (70%) and selectivity."
8,Conclusions,"Here we report an efficient catalytic approach for the upgrading of a biomass-derived platform chemical, levulinic acid, to γ-hydroxyvaleric acid (GHV) via transfer hydrogenation (TH) from renewably-sourced hydrogen donors - glycerol and ethanol. In this first report of the use of glycerol as a hydrogen donor for the TH of levulinic acid, we show that a quantitative yield of GHV can be achieved in the presence of base (KOH) in just 2 h at 150 °C with as little as 1–10 ppm catalyst precursor (TON 101,100; TOF: 50,550 h−1 with 1 ppm catalyst 4 ). Moreover, levulinic acid can be used directly without esterification, a process which is often required for transfer hydrogenation of this substrate. The reaction is catalyzed by robust ruthenium and iridium N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes with sulfonate functional groups at low catalyst loading (<10 ppm). The most active catalyst for TH from glycerol, [(NHC-SO3 -)2(CO)2Ir]Na (complex 4 ), was also previously identified as most efficient for acceptorless dehydrogenation of glycerol to lactic acid. The Ir(III) complex was less active than the Ir(I) complexes examined, while the Ru complexes tested were significantly less active than the iridium species. Using ethanol instead of glycerol as H2-donor, the optimized catalyst affords 7,580 TONs of GHV in 2 h. GHV can be readily converted to GVL upon acidification. Given the robust nature of this catalyst, further efforts are being directed towards its immobilization as a single-site catalyst for use in continuous flow reactors."
