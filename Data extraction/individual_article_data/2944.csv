0,Introduction,"Since Fujishima and Honda observed the splitting of water at a TiO2 electrode under the irradiation of ultraviolet (UV) light in 1972 [1], photocatalytic water splitting into hydrogen, a renewable, clean-burning and environmental-friendly fuel for the future energy sources, has been considered as one of significant and attractive solutions to solve the global energy and environmental problems [2–4]. The previous researches on photocatalytic water splitting using chemical photocatalysts have focused on the development of semiconductor-based photocatalytic materials [5–7]. In many presently known semiconductor photocatalysts, TiO2 was believed as the most promising photocatalyst for its superior photoreactivity, nontoxicity, long-term stability and low price. As a result, many reports have been published concerning photocatalytic H2 production activities [8–10]. However, the photocatalytic decomposition of water merely on the TiO2 photocatalyst is ineffective. One reason is that the production of hydrogen is limited by the rapid recombination of photoexcited holes and electrons. To improve photocatalytic efficiency, one of the effective strategies is to develop co-catalyst modified photocatalysts [11], such as noble metals or their oxides (e.g., Pt [12–15], Pd [16], Ru [17,18], Ag2O [11] and Rh [19,20]), transition metal oxides (e.g., NiO [21,22]) and transition metal sulfides (e.g., MoS2 [23,24]). The co-catalysts loaded on semiconductor photocatalysts play an essential role in the production of H2 and O2 by promoting the separation of photoexcited electrons and holes. Moreover, co-catalysts offer low activation potentials for H2 or O2 evolution and often serve as the active sites for H2 or O2 generation. Therefore, loading proper co-catalysts can greatly enhance the activities of photocatalysts. In most studies reported so far, mainly noble metals or their oxides have been employed as the co-catalysts which are very expensive and sources limited [25]. Although metal sulfides have demonstrated high activity in H2 involved reactions in heterogeneous catalysis, the inexpensive catalyst CuS has never been used as co-catalysts in photocatalytic H2 production [26–29]. In our study, CuS/TiO2 photocatalysts were synthesized and CuS was investigated as a cocatalyst for photocatalytic H2 production from methanol solution as the sacrificial agent under 500 W Xe lamp. A series of factors influencing the activities of CuS/TiO2 photocatalysts for H2 evolution have been investigated to understand the functions of the co-catalyst. We found that CuS could significantly enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 for H2 production and showed a potentially stable photocatalytic property."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation of CuS/TiO2 samples,"2.1 Preparation of CuS/TiO2 samples In a typical procedure, a mixture of 0.02 mol of P25 (99.5%, Degussa Corp, Germany) nanoparticles and 70 mL of deionized (DI) water were stirred at room temperature for 1 h. Various quantity ratios of cupric nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, 99.9%, Aladdin, China) and excess thiourea ((NH4)2S, 99%, Aladdin, China), which were used as the Cu and S precursors, were added in the above solution, continuously stirred for 1 h and ultrasonicated for 0.5 h to make a well mixed solution. The mixture was then transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 12 h. The resulting gray precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed with distilled water and ethanol several times to remove unbound impurity and then dried at 80 °C in air for 12 h and ground for 1 h."
3,Characterization of CuS/TiO2,"2.2 Characterization of CuS/TiO2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the metal oxides prepared were recorded on a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer D/Max-2400/PC equipped with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 20 mA). The samples were scanned at 2θ angles ranging from 10 to 80°at a scan speed of 10°min−1 and a time constant of 1 s. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra were measured by Shimadzu UV-3100 spectrophotometer using BaSO4 as the reflectance sample. The reflectance spectra were transformed to absorption intensity by using Kubelka–Munk method. The XPS spectra of the samples were measured using Leybold EA200 spectrophotometer with Mg Kα radiation at 75 W. SEM images were obtained using JSM-6701F. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study was carried out on a TECNAI TF20 instrument. The samples for TEM characterization were prepared by placing a drop of sample solution on carbon-coated copper grid and dried at room temperature. Elemental analysis of the photocatalysts were conducted by an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) attached to the transmission electron microscope."
4,Photocatalytic activity of CuS/TiO2,"2.3 Photocatalytic activity of CuS/TiO2 The photocatalytic reactions were carried out in a Pyrex photoreactor equipped with 500 W Xe lamp (Lancheng XQ-500, China). A quantity of catalyst equivalent to 50 mg of (CuS/TiO2) was dispersed in 80 mL of aqueous solution which contained 50% of methanol (v/v) as a sacrificial agent under the vertical irradiation of a 500 W Xe lamp. Magnetic stirring of the solution was maintained throughout the experiment in order to keep the photocatalyst particles in suspension status. The amounts of H2 evolution was measured by using a gas chromatography (5Å-coloum) with thermal conductivity detector (Huaai GC9560, China) and Ar as carrier gas."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of the CuS/TiO2,"3.1 Characterization of the CuS/TiO2 Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the P25, CuS/TiO2 photocatalysts and CuS. It could be seen from Fig. 1 that the hydrothermally synthesized CuS was crystallized into a standard hexagonal structure (JCPDS 06-0464). The XRD patterns shows main peaks with 2θ values of 29.2, 31.8, 32.7, 48.0, 52.7, and 59.5° corresponding to (102), (103), (006), (110), (108), and (116) crystal planes of pure CuS, respectively. As for the 5 wt% CuS/TiO2, a weak peak at 29.2° is due to (102) crystal plane diffraction of the hexagonal CuS. In addition, it is also observed that with increasing CuS content from 5 to 15 wt%, the diffraction peak intensities (102), (103), and (006) corresponding to the hexagonal structure CuS, increased obviously. Fig. 2 exhibits the UV–visible spectra of the P25 and CuS/TiO2. In the spectra of CuS/TiO2, we can observe an enhanced absorption in the visible-light region, from 400 to 800 nm. In addition, the samples show a stronger absorption for a larger quantity of CuS. In general, the band gap in semiconductor is related to the wavelength range absorbed where the band gap decreases with increasing absorption edge. Such an additional wavelength range absorbed (λ > 420 nm) can be attributed to the absorption of CuS phase. This result is consistent with the existence of highly dispersed CuS/TiO2 samples. A smaller band gap can reduce the photoactivity by increasing the recombination rate between electrons and holes, though photocatalysts with a narrow band gap could be readily extended for the utilization of visible light [30]. Fig. 3 A–D show the high-resolution XPS spectra of 1 wt% CuS/TiO2 before and after photocatalytic reaction. In Fig. 3A, two peaks at 458.9 eV and 464.6 eV are assigned to the Ti4+2p3/2 and Ti4+2p1/2 states in TiO2, respectively. In Fig. 3B, O 1s spectrum of TiO2 shows the characteristic peaks of Ti–O linkages at a binding energy value of 530.2 eV. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of Cu 2p region was shown in Fig. 3C. The measured binding energies of Cu2+2p3/2 and Cu2+2p1/2 are about 931.9 eV and 951.8 eV, respectively. These binding energies indicate that the element of copper presented on the surface of TiO2 is Cu(II). In addition, a shake-up line among the binding energies of Cu2+2p3/2 and Cu2+2p1/2 (indicated by the arrow in Fig. 3C) is observed which is the characteristic of photocatalysts having orbital configuration in the ground state, which corresponds to Cu(II) in the paramagnetic chemical state of Cu2+ [31]. However, after photocatalytic reaction, the XPS spectrum of Cu 2p region exhibits a significant change. The binding energies of Cu2+2p3/2 and Cu2+2p1/2 slightly right-shift to 932.9 and 952.9 eV, respectively, indicating after photocatalytic reaction, a small amount of Cu is slightly oxidized. In Fig. 3D, the close-up survey at the S 2p region shows the presence of a peak at 161.9 eV which indicates the presence of metal sulfides, as expected. Thus, we assure that 1 wt% CuS/TiO2 have a good light stability after photocatalytic reaction. To further obtain the microscopic polycrystalline structure information, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) of the samples have been carried out, as displayed in Fig. 4 . The images of SEM in Fig. 4A and B show P25 and 1 at% CuS/TiO2, respectively. It can be seen in Fig. 4A and B that most of the crystallites are spherical and their morphology are almost the same. The images of TEM for both samples are shown in Fig. 4C and D. There are not obvious differences between them. Therefore, on the basis of the SEM images and TEM images of samples, one can hardly observe the crystal phase attributed to CuS. This is more likely due to the high dispersion and low content of CuS in TiO2. As displayed in Fig. 4E, the result of EDX indicates the signals of Ti, O, Cu, and S elements."
7,Photocatalytic performance of CuS/TiO2,"3.2 Photocatalytic performance of CuS/TiO2 Photocatalytic overall water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen is generally difficult to achieve because it is a tough reaction. Sacrificial reagents can evaluate the photocatalytic activity for water splitting when the photocatalytic reaction is carried out in an aqueous solution including electron donors or hole scavengers, avoiding the electron–hole recombination [7]. Organic compounds, such as alcohols (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, etc.), organic acids (formic acid, acetic acid, etc.) have been used as sacrificial agent for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. Among them, methanol was most widely used. In this paper, methanol is employed as hole scavengers to test reactions of photocatalytic H2 evolution. Fig. 5 shows a comparison of the photocatalytic H2 production activity of the samples P25, 0.5 wt%, 1 wt%, 5 wt%, 10 wt%, 15 wt% CuS/TiO2 and pure CuS under methanol aqueous solution. As can be seen from the figure, the content of CuS has a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. When there is no CuS, P25 shows low photocatalytic activity because of the rapid recombination between Conduction Band (CB) electrons and Valence Band (VB) holes in pure TiO2. In addition, the presence of overpotential in the production of H2 on the TiO2 surface and the fast backward reaction (recombination of hydrogen and oxygen into water) made TiO2 less active (or inactive) in the photocatalytic water splitting in the absence of CuS. In the presence of a small amount of CuS clusters, the activity of the sample 0.5 wt% CuS/TiO2 is significantly enhanced. The photocatalytic activity of the samples further increased as the content of CuS content increases from 0.5% to 1%. The highest photocatalytic activity, 570 μmol h−1, was obtained for the sample 1 wt% CuS/TiO2. This value is 32 times more than that of P25. As shown in Fig. 5, further increase leads to a reduction of the photocatalytic activity. This is probably due to the following causes: (1) deposition of excessive CuS clusters gives rise to the decrease (or shield) of the TiO2 surface active sites; (2) increase in the opacity leads to a decrease of light photons passing through the reaction suspension solution; (3) recombination centers may be introduced at high loadings, which is another factor leads to the decreased activity [25]. To investigate the recyclable photocatalysis property of 1 wt% CuS/TiO2, a three-run of photocatalysis test was carried out under 500 W Xe lamp irradiation. The results are given in Fig. 6 . Three runs were carried out and after each run, the reaction system was evacuated. In the dark experiments, no other gaseous components were observed. At the same time, the evolution of H2 was observed under 500 W Xe lamp irradiation. The amount of the evolved H2 for 1 wt% CuS/TiO2 approximately linearly increases, as a function of the duration time and no obvious degradation occurs after the three-run of photocatalysis test, indicating a potential stable photocatalytic property."
8,Reaction mechanism,"3.3 Reaction mechanism The proposed mechanism for H2 production on photocatalysts CuS/TiO2 is shown in Fig.7 . The photogenerated holes will migrate to the host photocatalyst surface and react with methanol. The photogenerated electrons will transfer to the surface of TiO2 and reduce protons to H2. Because TiO2 lacks the active sites for H2 evolution, the rate of H2 evolution on bare TiO2 is extremely low. However, when the photogenerated electrons transfer from TiO2 to the CuS particles, protons can be efficiently reduced to produce H2 because CuS is a good co-catalyst for the reduction of protons. Moreover, intimate junctions can be formed between CuS and TiO2, which facilitates the electron transfer from TiO2 to CuS and reduces the electron–hole recombination [25]. In summary, the role of the CuS dispersed on the surface of the photocatalyst TiO2 is dominantly important, which can improve the photocatalytic activity of the water splitting because it not only promotes charge separation, but also reduces the bulk and surface electron–hole recombination. It can also accelerate the surface chemical reaction by inhibiting the backward reaction."
9,Conclusions,"CuS was synthesized by hydrothermal method at 160 °C for 12 h using thiourea as sulfur source, and loaded at different quantity ratios on P25 for photocatalysis. Through the EDX and XPS spectra of CuS/TiO2, we verified the existence of CuS on the surface of TiO2. In the presence of a small amount of CuS, the activity of the photocatalysts significantly enhanced. The maximum photocatalytic activity, 570 μmol h−1, was obtained for the 1 wt% CuS/TiO2 sample, which value is 32 times more than that of P25. In the test of the stability of the 1 wt% CuS/TiO2 photocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen production, no obvious degradation occurs after the three-run of photocatalytic reactions, indicating a potentially stable photocatalytic property."
