0,Introduction,"The continuous and rapidly increasing demand for energy, the world’s population growth and the release of CO2 in the atmosphere associated with conventional energy production technologies have induced the seek for alternative and renewable energy sources. In 2016, the synthesis of chemical products from fossil fuels represented 13% of the global crude oil demand [1] and it is expected to remain the principal factor of the increase in oil consumption at least until 2023 [2]. The utilization of biomass, especially lignocellulosic biomass, for the highly selective production of biofuels and value-added chemicals has attracted attention as a renewable alternative. Lignocellulosic biomass appears to be an attractive strategy to achieve the goal of more sustainable energy production [3,4]. Among all types of biomass, lignocellulosic biomass is emerging as the main source for biofuel production because it is the most abundant renewable source on earth. Additionally, biomass is available worldwide and it has the potential to be a carbon-neutral source due to CO2 captured during its growth. Biomass is mainly composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis and dehydration reactions enable the conversion of cellulose, the most abundant component in lignocellulosic biomass, to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) which is one of numerous “building blocks” molecules for value-added bio-based chemicals [3,5]. HMF is an attractive molecule due to its chemical structure which gives it different functionalities (furan ring, aldehyde, olefinic and hydroxyl groups) making it vulnerable to catalytic transformations through different reactions such as hydrogenation, oxygenation and esterification [3,6]. Thus, different molecules such as 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF), 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF), 2,5-dihydroxytetrahydrofuran (DHMTHF), formic acid and a range of pyridine, pyrrole, cyclopentenone and thiophene derivatives can be obtained from HMF [7]. Among all chemical products derived from HMF, DMF has been identified for fuel applications due to its desirable physical and chemical properties: high energetic density (30 kJ.cm−3), high octane number (RON = 119), low oxygen content (O/C = 0.17) and a satisfactory boiling point (365–367 K) [8]. In addition, DMF is uncompetitive with the food chain [9]. Moreover, DMF is insoluble in water and when compared to ethanol, it is easier to blend with gasoline which indicates that DMF has the characteristics to become a good gasoline substitute [10,11]. The conversion of HMF may result in several by-products such as side chain, ring-hydrogenated products and ring-opening products due to different HMF functionalities [12]. The CC and CO bonding energies are 615 kJ/mol and 715 kJ/mol, respectively [13]. The reaction pathway and product distribution are strongly dependent upon reaction conditions and the type of employed catalyst [14]. In this context, for DMF synthesis, hydrogen needs to selectively react with formyl and hydroxyl groups without excessively hydrogenating or opening the furan ring [5,12]. In this context, different efforts have been made to develop highly selective catalysts. Noble-metal such as Ru, Pt and Pd and mainly Ru systems have been applied in HMF hydrogenation [5,12]. Pd/C catalysts exhibited 95% of DMF yield in presence of weak acids (HCOOH and CH3COOH), which acted as hydrogen source and reactant for deoxygenation, suppressing the decarbonylation and ring hydrogenation reactions [5,12]. Zu et al. [15] observed a 94.1% yield of DMF and 99% HMF conversion over Ru/Co3O4 catalyst at a low temperature and H2 pressure (403 K and 7 bar, respectively) in 24 h of reaction using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a solvent. Ru carried out the hydrogenation while CoOx species participated in the hydrogenolysis of the hydroxyl group. According to Nagpure [16], DMF formation was improved at high temperatures. Using a Ru/NaY catalyst, THF as a solvent and 15 bar H2 at 493 K, a complete HMF conversion with a 78% yield of DMF was obtained. Some bimetallic systems such as Pd-Au [8], Pt-Co, Pd-Ru [7], Cu-Pd [17] and Cu-Ni [18] have shown high DMF selectivity (>90%) as the incorporation of a second metal can lead to electronic and geometric interactions of metallic active sites favoring the reaction [5,7,18]. The high cost and scarcity of noble-metal catalysts limit their wide practical application and the synthesis of non-noble metal systems is still desirable. Ni and Cu-based catalysts are effective for DMF production [5,7,19,20]. Cu catalysts show a poor affinity for CC bonds and high reactivity to CO bonds [21]. The intermediate species adsorb on the Cu surface by the oxygen atom from the CO bond. Furthermore, control of catalyst acidity is crucial, particularly when the target product is DMF. An adequate amount of acid sites and reaction conditions (temperature and H2 pressure) can lead to DMF formation through the hydrogenolysis of CH2OH groups [21]. Besides, strong acid conditions and acid supports can catalyze secondary reactions such as polymerization, dehydration and cracking and consequently a lower DMF selectivity is obtained [9]. In this context, different supports lead to different catalytic performances which means that the support properties play a role in this reaction. Thus, not only the metal but also support properties, metal-support interactions and reaction conditions should be considered for tunable synthesis of DMF [22]. Zhu et al. [21] tested a Cu/ZnO catalyst with a Cu/Zn molar ratio of 2 which exhibited a DMF yield of 91.8% due to the high dispersed metallic phase and well-controlled acid sites. Fe and Ni-Fe supported on carbon nanotubes (CNT) were used by Yu et al. [23]. The high interaction between the oxygen of the carbonyl group and oxyphilic Fe atoms promoted the hydrogenolysis of the C-O bond of furfural. Ni-Fe/CNT catalyst exhibited 91.3% of DMF yield at 473 K while Fe/CNT system showed very low activity for HMF transformation. Recently, An et al. [24] showed that Co catalysts with a well-defined structure, which improved the uniform distribution of Co and also a strong can efficiently convert HMF into DMF (74.2% of DMF yield) at mild reaction conditions (343 K and 0.7 MPa H2). Noble metal such as Pt and Ru and non-noble such as Ni and Cu metal systems and non-noble such as Ni and Cu metal systems supported on oxides of different nature (HY, Al2O3, Al2O3, ZrO2 and TiO2) were used in HMF hydrogenation to produce DMF by Iriondo and co-workers [25]. All tested catalysts showed activity for HMF conversion but high DMF selectivity was obtained over Cu/ZrO2 catalyst probably due to the neutral properties of zirconia. Cu catalysts are among the best catalysts as an alternative to more expensive and less environmentally benign noble metal catalysts [4,20,26]. Also, supports with appropriate acid characteristics may favor DMF production from HMF. Alumina is an acidic support with a high surface area and it has been used as a solid support to obtain that kind of product [27]. However, as an acidic support, alumina can catalyze undesirable reactions. Niobia and iron oxide, two other acidic supports have also had an application in hydrogenation reactions. Niobia properties such as strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) and oxygen mobility were beneficial for its use as a support or promoter in different catalytic reactions [28]. Moreover, depending on calcination temperature, niobia shows different acid character [29] and consequently different distribution of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites. To the best of our knowledge, the combination of alumina with niobia and/or iron oxide and the influence of different acid sites have not been investigated before. In this work, the effect of different supports on the reactivity of copper catalysts for HMF hydrogenation was studied. For this purpose, Al2O3, Fe2O3, Fe2O3-Al2O3, Nb2O5 and Nb2O5-Al2O3 (calcined at 623 and 773 K) supported copper catalysts (5 wt% loading) were prepared and tested in HMF hydrogenation at 423 K and 20 bar H2 using THF as solvent which is the extensively used and reported in works with the high catalytic performance for HMF hydrogenation [9]."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Nb2O5 and Al2O3 were prepared by calcination of niobic acid (Nb2O5-nH2O - CBMM) and alumina (Al2O3-SBA-200, Sasol), respectively, at 773 K for 2 h with a heating rate of 10 K/min. Fe2O3 was prepared from a solution of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (2 M) (Sigma-Aldrich) using a solution of NH4OH (1.5 M) (Sigma Aldrich) as a precipitation agent. The precipitate was filtered and washed with deionized water until pH 7. Then, the support was dried at 393 K for 12 h and calcined at 773 K for 2 h with a heating rate of 10 K/min. Nb2O5-Al2O3-773 was prepared using an ethanol solution containing both supports previously calcined at 773 K to obtain a mixed oxide with 25 wt% of Nb2O5. The solution was stirred during 3 h at 313 K, filtrated and then the support was dried at 393 K and calcined at 773 K for 2 h with a heating rate of 10 K/min. Nb2O5-Al2O3-623 was prepared using an ethanol solution containing Al2O3 previously calcined at 773 K and niobic acid (Nb2O5-nH2O) to obtain a mixed oxide with 25 wt% of Nb2O5. The ethanol solution was stirred during 3 h at 313 K and then the support was dried at 393 K for 12 h and calcined at 623 K for 2 h with a heating rate of 10 K/min. Two different calcination temperature were used because calcination temperature is an essential factor that improve some characteristic such as catalyst acidity [29]. The preparation of Fe2O3-Al2O3 consisted in the precipitation of Fe2O3 on alumina to obtain a Fe2O3 content of 25 wt%. The calcined alumina was dissolved in deionized water and a solution of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (0.3 M) was added along with a solution of NH4OH (1.5 M) as precipitation agent. The precipitate was filtered and washed with deionized water until pH 7, dried at 393 K and then calcined at 773 K for 2 h. Copper catalysts supported on Nb2O5, Fe2O3, Al2O3, Fe2O3-Al2O3, and Nb2O5-Al2O3 were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using Cu(NO3)2 (Sigma Aldrich) as precursor and water as a solvent. The amount of precursor used in all catalysts was suitable to obtain catalysts with a Cu loading of 5 wt%. After copper impregnation, the as-prepared catalysts were dried at 393 K overnight and then calcined at the same temperature of the respective support. Prior to characterization techniques, the samples were reduced at 623 K under H2 flow (30 mL/min) for 2 h with a heating rate of 10 K/min. After that, they were cooled down to room temperature and the catalysts were passivated at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) using a mixture of 1% O2/He flow (30 mL/min) during 30 min. The catalysts were named as Cu/Al2O3, Cu/Fe2O3, Cu/Nb2O5, Cu/Fe2O3-Al2O3, Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623, and Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-773."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Textural properties of the passivated catalysts were determined by N2 physisorption in an adsorption–desorption equipment (Micromeritics ASAP-2020). The analysis was performed at 77 K. The surface area was obtained by the BET (Brunauer, Emmett and Teller) method and the average pore diameter and pore volume were obtained by BJH (Barrett, Joyner and Halenda) method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out in a Rigaku Miniflex II X-ray diffractometer (Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.540 Å). XRD patterns of passivated catalysts were recorded with 2θ between 10°–90°. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were carried out in a multipurpose unit coupled to a mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Prisma). The weight of calcined samples was 0.5 g, the reduction mixture was composed of 5% H2/Ar (30 mL/min) and temperature varied from 298 K to 1223 K (10 K/min). N2O titration was performed in a multipurpose unit coupled to a mass spectrometer (HPR-20, Hiden) in order to evaluate copper dispersion. Initially, the samples were dried at 473 K for 30 min under He flow. After this, the catalysts were cooled to 298 K and then were reduced with H2 flow at 623 K for 2 h. After reduction, they were purged with He at the same temperature and cooled to 363 K. At 363 K the gas flow was switched to an oxidizing mixture of 10% N2O/He (50 mL/min) for 1 h. After this oxidation step, the samples were cooled at 298 K under He flow and then heated to 673 K with a 5%H2/Ar gas mixture. H2 consumption was monitored by mass spectrometry and this second reduction was used to estimate the surface copper atoms considering the following reactions: (1) 2 C u (s) + N 2 O (g) → C u 2 O (s) + N 2(g) (2) C u 2 O (s) + H 2(g) → 2 C u 0 (s) + H 2 O (g) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed with a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer with a monochromatic Al-Kα X-ray source. The analyses were carried out with a pass energy of 25 eV, energy step of 0.05 eV and dwell time of 50 ms. Charging effects were minimized with a low energy electron flood gun. The pressure was kept around 10−8 mbar inside the analysis chamber. The peak positions in spectra were corrected using the C1s peak (284.5 eV) as a reference and an ion beam etching with Ar+- was used to break the oxygen film created during the passivation. NH3-temperature programmed desorption (TPD-NH3) measurements were performed in a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 device. Prior to the experiments, the samples were dried at 423 K with He for 1 h and then reduced with H2 at 623 K for 2 h. After that, the samples were purged with He at 623 K and then cooled down to 343 K to adsorb NH3 by flowing a mixture of 10% NH3/He during 30 min. The samples were then flushed with a He flow of 25 mL/min for 1 h to eliminate the excess of ammonia. Finally, TPD-NH3 profiles were obtained under He flow from 343 K to 1173 K (10 K/min). Diffuse reflectance infrared with Fourier transform spectroscopy of pyridine (DRIFTS-Pyr) was carried out in a Nicolet iS50 equipment. The system is formed by a FT-IR spectrometer (Bruker, Vertex 70) with a diffuse reflectance cell (Harrick, HVC-DRP-4). Firstly, the catalyst samples were dried at 423 K in He flow for 1 h, cooled at 298 K, reduced at 623 K under H2 flow for 2 h, purged with He for 30 min and cooled down to 298 K. At this temperature, a background interferogram was obtained. After that, pyridine was introduced and held for 1 h. After pyridine adsorption, the catalyst was purged with He and then another interferogram was taken at room temperature. This interferogram was associated with the background reference to establish the spectrum of Lewis and/or Bronsted acid sites. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs were acquired in a JEOL equipment model JSM-7100F (5–30 kV). The samples were also characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM analyses were carried out in a JEOL JEM-1011 microscope with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The samples were prepared by dispersion in alcoholic solution (propanol) under sonication for 1 h and were deposited on a copper support grid and dried at room temperature. A minimum of 100 particles was counted using Gatan-Digital Micrograph software to obtain the particle size for each catalyst. Raman spectra of the passivated catalysts were obtained at 298 K in a Witec Alpha 300 Confocal Raman Microscope, using a 50x objective lens and 532 nm excitation laser wavelength. We defined the degree alumina coverage (Θ) as the ratio between the area of the most intense band of Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3 or Cu/Fe2O3-Al2O3 and the area of the most intense band of Cu/Nb2O5 or Cu/Fe2O3, respectively."
4,Hydrogenation reactions,"2.3 Hydrogenation reactions Hydrogenation reactions were carried out in the liquid phase using an autoclave reactor (Parr Instruments Co.) for 10 h. The volume was 50 mL of a solution of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (0.1 M) dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 0.3 g of passivated catalyst. The reactor was purged with N2 (50 mL/min) to remove some traces of air present in the system and then H2 flowed at 30 mL/min through the reactor for 30 min. After this step, H2 pressure was raised (20 bar), stirring speed was 700 rpm and the temperature of the reaction was 423 K. Liquid samples were taken periodically during reaction time. The liquid phase products were separated in a GC–MS QP2010Plus (Shimadzu) equipped with a capillary column (Supelcowax) and coupled to a mass spectrometer. After each reaction, the catalyst was collected by filtration, followed by continuously washing with deionized water, drying at 393 K overnight and directly applied for catalyst recycling. The conversion and product yield were calculated based on carbon balance. Product yield (Yi ) was calculated using the following equation (3) Y i % = j i y i ∑ j i y i × 100 in which ji is the number of carbons of product i and yi is the molar fraction of product i, including unreacted HMF. The carbon balance kept above 95%. The reaction rate was obtained from the HMF conversion results at 0.16 h of reaction and considering a pseudo-first order reaction. For a first-order reaction in a batch reactor at constant volume: (4) ln ( 1 - - X HMF ) = k t The initial reaction rate (μmol.gcat −1.s−1) was determined using Eq. (5): (5) ( - r A ) 0 = k C HMF 0 V W where, XHMF is HMF conversion at 0.16 h, k is rate constant (s−1), t is time (s), C HMF 0 is the initial concentration of HMF (mol/L) and W (g) is the mass of catalyst. The number of surface Cu metal sites per mass loading of all catalysts were determined by N2O titration and turnover frequency (TOF) was calculate following the Eq. (6): (6) T O F s - 1 = ( - r A ) 0 number o f s u r f a c e C u a t o m s"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffractograms of the passivated catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 1 . There were typical diffraction peaks of the supports such as γ-Al2O3 (JCPDS 10–0425), Nb2O5 with TT phase (JCPDS 28–0317) and amorphous Nb2O5 [29] and α-Fe2O3 (JCPDS 87–1166) [30]. Except for Cu/Fe2O3 catalyst, there was not any characteristic pattern of metallic copper or their oxide species probably due to the low copper content and high metal dispersion. Diffraction peaks of monoclinic copper oxide, CuO (JCPDS 80–1917) were observed in the case of Cu/Fe2O3, Fig. 1 (b), and the most intense peak was identified at 2θ = 35.5°. This peak was also observed by Liu et al. [31]. BET surface area, pore diameter and copper dispersion for the several catalysts are listed in Table 1 . The catalysts with the highest and lowest specific area were Cu/Al2O3 (173 m2/g) and Cu/Fe2O3 (9.0 m2/g), respectively. The addition of Fe2O3 and Nb2O5 to Al2O3 resulted in a lower specific area for Cu/Fe2O3-Al2O3 (136 m2/g), Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623 (146 m2/g) and Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-773 (136 m2/g) catalysts as compared to Cu/Al2O3. This behavior can be attributed to the obstruction of some alumina pores by hematite and niobia. Fig. S1 shows the adsorption isotherms of the passivated catalysts. Catalysts containing Al2O3 and Cu/Nb2O5 presented type IV(a) isotherms and type H2 hysteresis loop while Cu/Fe2O3 presented type V isotherm with type H1 hysteresis. H2 hysteresis is characteristic of ‘ink bottle’ and H1 hysteresis represents ‘slit-like’ pores [32]. Pore diameter results indicated that all catalysts might be categorized as mesoporous catalysts considering that the average pore diameters range were between 2 and 50 nm. As can be seen in Table 1, copper dispersion essentially kept the same trend as surface area values. Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623 and Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-773 catalysts showed the highest values which can be related to their high surface areas, allowing an adequate distribution of metal particles. Cu/Fe2O3 catalyst presented the lowest value of dispersion which is well consistent with XRD results where copper diffraction lines were observed due to the agglomeration of CuO. Copper dispersion was improved by the presence of Al2O3 [33]. Cu/Fe2O3 showed a dispersion of 15% while Cu/Fe2O3-Al2O3 showed a dispersion of 35%. H2-TPR profiles of the calcined catalysts are presented in Fig. 2 . The systems showed reduction signals of copper oxide (CuO) at temperatures below 600 K. These results suggest the presence of small CuO particles and a high copper dispersion [34,35]. For Cu/Fe2O3 catalyst, TPR profile displayed CuO and Fe2O3 reduction to Cu (490 K) and Fe3O4 (580 K) and a broad signal at 980 K which can be related to further reduction to FeO [36]. The reduction of pristine iron oxide usually starts at ~623 K and Fig. 2 (b) shows that the presence of CuO on Fe2O3 decreased the temperature at which this reduction occurs to ~580 K. Litt et al. [36] and Zhang et al. [37] presented similar TPR profiles. In the case of Cu/Fe2O3-Al2O3, three different peaks were observed at 500, 560 and 677 K. The peaks at temperatures below 600 K were assigned to the reduction of CuO particles highly dispersed (small peak at 500 K) and bulk CuO (560 K) which did not disperse on the surface. The reduction of Fe2O3 took place at higher temperatures (677 K) when compared to Cu/Fe2O3. The shift in the reduction temperature of Fe2O3 indicated that there was a strong interaction between Fe2O3 and Al2O3 [38]. H2 uptake peaks at temperatures around 1000 K were related to the reduction of Fe2Ox species. The addition of Al2O3 shifted the Fe2Ox reduction peak from 980 K to 1103 K [33,37]. The reduction (423–750 K) profile of CuO supported on γ-Al2O3 and Nb2O5 (Fig. 2 (a) and (d)) could either follow a one-step reduction mechanism or proceed via a a two-step reduction where Cu2+ is first reduced to Cu1+, followed by the reduction of Cu1+ to Cu0 [18]. For these two catalysts, a two-step reduction was not evident. There were main peaks at 560 K and 542 K for Cu/Al2O3 and Cu/Nb2O5, respectively, which suggest a one-step reduction CuO that is characteristic of systems with a uniform size distribution of CuO particles [35]. For Cu/Al2O3 the small peak located at 597 K can be attributed to the reduction of bulk CuO [18]. In addition, catalysts containing niobia showed a H2 uptake peak at high temperatures (>1000 K) which was related to the reduction of bulk Nb2O5 [29]. In the case of Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623 and Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-773 catalysts, the reduction of CuO occurred at temperatures between 450 and 700 and 450–600 K, respectively. For Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623, the shifting towards higher temperatures might be related to the enhanced interaction of copper species with NbOx species [39]. H2 consumption during TPR is shown in Table 1. For Cu/Al2O3, Cu/Fe2O3-Al2O3, Cu/Nb2O5 and Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-773 catalysts, the amount of H2 consumed in TPR analysis was very close to the stoichiometric amount of H2 required for the total reduction of CuO to Cu0 (7.87x10-4 mol H2/gcat). However, for Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623 and Cu/Fe2O3 catalysts, the H2 consumption exceeded the theoretical value. This behavior is related to the partial reduction of the supports (NbOx and Fe3Ox) [39]. The surface acidity of copper systems was investigated by TPD-NH3. Fig. 3 shows the obtained TPD-NH3 profiles and the acidity values expressed as the amount of NH3 desorbed are presented in Table 1. Here, the strength of acid sites is categorized as weak, moderate and strong as desorption peaks are at temperatures below 473 K, between 473 and 673 K and above 673 K, respectively [25,28]. Thus, analyzing the TPD-NH3 profiles and the amounts of desorbed ammonia, Cu/Al2O3 catalyst presented high acidity. Cu/Fe2O3 and Cu/Nb2O5 showed the lowest acidity values, 0.13 and 0.15 mol NH3/gcat, respectively. Cu/Fe2O3 displayed only one desorption peak at 948 K which can be related to strong acid sites. Still, the total acidity was higher for Cu/Fe2O3-Al2O3 (0.39 mol NH3/gcat) than for Cu/Fe2O3 (0.13 mol NH3/gcat). These results suggested that the surface acidity of Cu/Fe2O3-Al2O3 catalyst was essentially originated from alumina. Niobia calcined at moderate temperatures (373–573 K) showed acidic properties. However, it became almost neutral when calcined at 873 K due to the transformation from amorphous to crystalline phases such as TT phase [29]. For Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623 catalyst, there was a NH3 desorption peak at 790 K (Fig. 3 (e)) as the addition of niobia on alumina decreased the fraction of Lewis acid sites and increased the fraction of Brønsted acid sites [28,40]. However, due to the higher temperature of calcination, for Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-773, no desorption peaks were observed at temperatures above 673 K. Fig. 4 shows the infrared spectra of adsorbed pyridine on copper catalysts in the range between 1400 and 1750 cm−1. The characteristic bands at 1535–1550 cm−1 are ascribed to pyridine adsorbed on Brønsted acid sites while the bands associated to pyridine on Lewis acid sites appear at 1440–1460 cm−1 and 1600–1635 cm−1 [40,41]. Except for Cu/Fe2O3 catalysts, Lewis acid sites were observed for copper catalysts. The catalysts also exhibited a small band at 1577 cm−1 which corresponds to the contribution from residual physically adsorbed pyridine (PPy). Cu/Al2O3 catalyst showed both Lewis (1450 and 1608 cm−1) and Brønsted acid sites (1540 cm−1). In the same way, the band at 1488 cm−1 corresponds to simultaneously Lewis and Brønsted acid sites [40]. This band was also observed in the case of Cu/Nb2O5, Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623, and Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-773 catalysts. Furthermore, for catalysts containing alumina, hydrogen-bonded pyridine bands (HPy) were observed at 1445 and 1590 cm−1 and they can be assigned to bridging and multi-centered OH-groups as observed by Zaki et al. [41]. In the case of Cu/ Fe2O3, there were only Brønsted acid sites attributed to the weak band at 1540 cm−1. However, for Cu/Fe2O3-Al2O3 a band at 1602 cm−1 was also detected indicating the presence of alumina increases the amount of Lewis acid sites. These results are consistent with TPD-NH3 results obtained for Cu/Fe2O3 and Cu/Fe2O3-Al2O3 catalysts. The observed band at 1472 cm−1 possibly results from the interactions between adsorbed pyridine and metal oxides [42]. The Raman spectra of copper systems are presented in Fig. 5 . The characteristic bands of CuO expected at 290, 340 and 630 cm−1 were not observed suggesting an adequate dispersion of CuO [39,43], in agreement with XRD results. As observed by Luo et al. [44], only for catalysts with high copper loading (>20 wt%) CuO, Raman spectroscopy bands can be observed. The Raman spectrum for Cu/Al2O3 was blank because this catalyst absorbed most of the Raman laser that enters into the bulk of the sample [44]. The Raman spectra of Cu/Fe2O3 and Cu/Fe2O3-Al2O3 catalysts show that the structure of Fe2O3 is hematite, which is related to the bands at 210 and 294 cm−1 (A1g mode) and at 247, 411 and 616 cm−1 (Eg mode) whereas bands at 1324 and 1338 cm−1 are attributed to hematite two-magnon scattering [45]. Concerning the Raman spectra of Cu/Nb2O5, Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623 and Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-773 (Fig. 5 (d), (e) and (f)), there were bands at 136, 235, 311 and 650–702 cm−1. The bands at 136, 235 cm−1 are related to the bending modes of the Nb-O-Nb linkages and the band at 315 cm−1 is ascribed to multiple distortions of an isolated octahedron of Nb species [39,46]. The presence of this band means that clusters of Nb2O5 may be formed after copper incorporation and catalyst calcination [39]. The Raman features of niobia containing catalysts are similar but the bands in 100–350 cm−1 region are more intense and resolved for catalysts calcined at 773 K. Further, the broad band at ~650–700 cm−1 correspond to the symmetric stretching mode of the niobia polyhedra and the increase of the calcination temperature from 623 to 773 K leads to a shift of this band from 652 to 702 cm−1 due to increasing bond order of the niobia polyhedral. Also, the sharpening of this band is attributed to the more ordered structure present in the TT-Nb2O5 [46], as observed in XRD results. Niobia species in Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623 (Fig. 1. (e)) were found to be poorly crystalline whereas in Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-773 (Fig. 1. (f)) they were present in a well-defined crystalline structure. Two additional broad and weak bands at 885 and 1225 cm−1 were detected in Raman spectra of Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623 and Cu/Nb2O5, respectively. These bands are attributed to terminal NbO bonds within different isolated or polymerized NbOx surface species [46,47]. The degree of Al2O3 surface coverages (Θ) by Fe2O3 and Nb2O5 were determined for Cu/Fe2O3-Al2O3, Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623, and Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-773 catalysts. As can be seen in Table 2 , Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623 catalysts presented the lowest Θ value and the other two catalysts presented similar values of Θ. The X-ray photoelectron spectra of Cu 2p for all catalysts are depicted in Fig. 6 . Fig. 6 A displays results from samples after reduction and subsequent passivation and Fig. 6 B shows spectra of samples after Ar+- etching. The data indicated both Cu2+ and Cu0 species exist in all the catalysts. However, the possibility of Cu1+ cannot be ruled out as the binding energies of Cu0 and Cu1+ species are almost the same, which hampers their identification [34,48]. Besides, a shake-up satellite peak at 940.0–944.0 eV for Cu 2p implying the presence of Cu2+ species in the catalysts [34,37,49]. The binding energies at 930.7–932.9 eV and 950.4–952.7 eV corresponds to Cu0 2p3/2 and Cu0 2p 1/2, respectively while the binding energies at 933.0–934.0 eV and 952.0–954.1 eV are associated to Cu2+ 2p 3/2 and Cu2+ 2p1/2, respectively. This behavior has also been observed in other studies [37,49,50]. After Ar+- etching (Fig. 6 B), the contribution of Cu2+ species was lower due to the removal of the oxygen film created during passivation. Also, the absence of satellite peaks in some catalysts showed that the Cu2+ in the systems were fully reduced to Cu0 [49]. It must be added that the surface copper metallic species content increased after the Ar+- etching (Table 2) and the deconvoluted peaks (Fig. 6 B) also indicated a higher contribution of copper metallic species. The binding energy (BE) of the elements included in copper supported catalysts are summarized in Table S1 and the Cu surface content and Cu/support atomic ratios are presented in Table 2. Cu/Fe2O3 showed the highest Cu/support atomic ratio (Table 2) and after Ar+-etching, there was an increase from 0.11 to 0.17. This result indicates that the number of copper surface atoms increased upon removal of oxygen film by Ar+-etching [51]. Fe 2p XPS spectra of Cu/Fe2O3 and Cu/Fe2O3-Al2O3 catalysts (Fig. S2) showed the main peaks of Fe 2p 3/2 and Fe 2p1 /2. The peaks at ~710 eV (Fe2p3/2) and ~723 eV (Fe 2p 1/2) are attributed to the oxidized Fe3+ species and the peaks at ~714 eV (Fe 2p 3/2) and ~730 eV (Fe 2p 1/2) to oxidized Fe2+ species [52,53]. Besides, for Cu/Fe2O3 catalyst, before Ar+-etching, the main peak of Fe 2p 3/2 is accompanied by a satellite at ~719 eV which indicates that the valences of iron are 2+ and 3+ [50]. Also, O 1 s spectra could be resolved by deconvolution into two peaks at 529.9 and 530.9 eV (Table S1), which were attributed to the lattice oxygen of Fe2O3 and CuO [54]. On the other hand, the addition of Al2O3 increases the binding energy of O 1s peak from 529.9 to 530.6 eV along with peak broadening which suggests that the oxygen on the surface had been influenced by Al2O3 [55]. There was not the presence of zero-valent Fe metal on iron-containing catalysts (~707 eV) even after Ar+-etching [56]. The shift of Fe 2p peaks to higher binding energies (Table S1) for Cu/Fe2O3-Al2O3 catalysts might suggest interactions between iron and alumina and the Al 2p XPS spectra exhibited two peaks at 73.7 and 76.1 eV (Fig. S3 B) whereas Al 2p XPS spectra of Cu/Al2O3 (Fig. S3 A) only presented one peak at 74.6 eV [57]. For Cu/Nb2O5, the Nb 3d peak is a doublet with a 2.6 eV split (Fig. S4) and the binding energy value of the Nb 3d5/2 peak at 207.5 eV is characteristic of Nb5+ [58,59]. After Ar+- etching, there were peaks assigned to Nb4+ at ~206.2 eV and the Nb4+/Nb5+ ratio (Table S1) also increased indicating a surface enrichment in Nb4+. This trend was also observed for Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-773 catalyst and it was explained by the calcination (773 K) [60] and reduction (623 K) temperatures used in the reduction/passivated step performed before analysis. Niobia is a typical SMSI oxide and can be partially reduced and the metal surface can be with NbOx species [29]. Furthermore, Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-773 catalyst showed peaks at lower binding energies (~203.5 eV) after Ar+- etching. This doublet is related to NbO or NbOx (x:1–2) [58,59]. These species were also observed on Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623 catalyst. The Nb/Al ratios values (Table S1) of Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623 and Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-773 catalysts were the same (Nb/Al = 0.11) and a higher concentration of niobia at the surface was observed after Ar+- etching, Nb/Al = 0.13 and Nb/Al = 0.12, respectively. The elemental distribution in Cu/Fe2O3-Al2O3, Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623, and Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-773 catalysts were obtained by SEM-EDS technique (Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic) and the mapping images are present in Fig. 7 . This exploration allowed the detection of Fe or Nb (orange) and Al (green). There was a sponge‐like mesoporous structure in each sample which made it difficult for the identification of copper particles. Fig. 7 (a) and (c) display uniform distribution of Fe and Nb (orange) on alumina (green). However, for Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623 catalyst just a few orange points were observed and this result is in agreement with the lower degree of alumina coverage (Θ = 0.43, Table 3 ) obtained from Raman results. For a deeper analysis of the Cu distribution and particle size, TEM images were recorded. TEM micrographs of copper supported catalysts are shown in Fig. 8 and the histograms of particle size distribution are in Fig. S5. They reveal that copper particles were uniformly distributed on and present a small size (dp < 10 nm, Table 3) on the different supports. The distribution of copper particles on the different supports is consistent with the results of N2O titration where Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623 showed the highest Cu dispersion. Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-773 and Cu/Fe2O3 showed the lowest and largest average particle size, 2.8 and 8.8 nm, respectively. TEM results further support the XRD finding that Cu/Fe2O3 presented poorly dispersed Cu species and larger particle size than the other catalysts."
7,Catalytic tests,"3.2 Catalytic tests The absence/presence of mass transfer limitations was examined by the determination Weisz-Prater parameter using a 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) diffusivity in tetrahydrofuran (THF) equal to 1.52 × 10−8 cm2/s and considering that the largest catalyst particles have a maximum radius of 31.5 µm. The Weisz-Prater values for the several catalysts were lower than 0.3 which suffices for kinetic control. HMF hydrogenation reaction towards DMF was conducted at 423 K and a hydrogen pressure of 20 bar. The turnover frequency (TOF) was determined following equation (6). Table 3 summarizes the initial rate (-rA )0 for HMF hydrogenation, turnover frequency (TOF), HMF conversion and DMF yield obtained during HMF hydrogenation reaction over the investigated catalysts. The systems exhibited TOF behavior in the following sequence: Cu/Fe2O3-Al2O3 > Cu/Al2O3 > Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-773 > Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623 > Cu/Fe2O3 > Cu/Nb2O5, reflecting the higher catalytic performance of alumina containing catalysts. These results suggest that Cu/Fe2O3-Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 catalysts are the most active catalysts under initial conditions. At HMF iso-conversion of 30% (Table 3), Cu/Nb2O5 showed higher DMF yield, but lower 2,5-bis (hydroxymethyl) furan (BHMF) yield than the other catalysts. This indicates that although the activity for this catalyst is low, the further conversion of BHMF to DMF is relatively fast. Fig. 9 shows the HMF conversion and DMF yield obtained during the selective hydrogenation reaction over the studied catalysts. Cu/Fe2O3 showed the lowest HMF conversion during all reaction time possibly due to the agglomeration and low dispersion of copper particles as observed in XRD, N2O titration and TEM results. However, for Cu/Fe2O3-Al2O3 catalysts, HMF conversion reached 90.7% at the first hour of reaction. Cu/Al2O3 showed a similar trend with an HMF conversion of 94.6% during the first hour. Further, Cu/Al2O3 and Cu/Fe2O3-Al2O3 showed the highest DMF yield at the first hour and all over reaction time followed by Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-773. Among all niobia containing catalysts, Cu/Nb2O5 exhibited the lowest HMF conversion (52%) after 10 h of reaction. The performance of Cu/Al2O3, Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623, and Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-773 catalysts were quite similar. As observed in Fig. 9 (a), these catalysts showed a complete HMF conversion after 1 h of reaction, remaining constant until 10 h of reacion time with a high DMF yield of 94, 84 and 88% (Fig. 9 (c)) for Cu/Al2O3, Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623 and Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-773 catalysts, respectively. In contrast, Srivastava et al. [61], found around 21% HMF conversion and 5.6% of DMF yield at 2 h of reaction for bimetallic Cu-Co catalysts. However, they found a DMF yield increase followed by a slightly decrease between 8 and 10 h due to the formation of by‐products. The difference in activity among the investigated catalysts was due to the nature of the support (Table 3). It should be noted that the high BET surface area improved the metal dispersion and the copper dispersion could be related to HMF conversion. Nevertheless, TOF results (Table 3) increased with Cu particle size (Table 1) when Al2O3 supported catalysts were considered, but this parameter is not the only one that contributes to catalytic performance. Cu/Al2O3 showed higher acidity than Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623 or Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-773 catalyst (Table 1) and larger particle size (Table 3). Control of the acidity is essential when the target compound is DMF [21]. Cu/Al2O3 and Cu/Fe2O3-Al2O3, which were the most active catalysts, presented similar copper dispersion (Table 1), 33% and 35%, respectively. Moreover, DMF yield correlated with total acidity (Table 1): Cu/Al2O3 exhibited the highest acidity (0.55 mol NH3/gcat) followed by Cu/Fe2O3-Al2O3 (0.39 mol NH3/gcat). Cu/Fe2O3 presented the lowest dispersion and acidity and consequently lower TOF (20.2 h−1). In contrast, Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623 and Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-773 which showed the highest copper dispersion presented high HMF conversion (~100%) but their acidity was not quite enough to obtain a DMF higher than that obtained with more acid catalysts. It is accepted that bifunctional catalysts can favor DMF production. In the work of Li et al (2018) [62], hydrogenation of HMF to DMF was carried out using Co3O4 as catalyst and there were different cobalt species when different reduction temperatures were used. At 673 K, Co–CoOx species were observed and the authors suggested that Co0 acted as the active hydrogenation sites and CoOx worked as acid promoter for the selective hydrogenation of HMF to DMF. Thus, our results suggest that the active site is formed by Cu0 and a Lewis acid site (Cu°-Al+, Cu°-Fe+, Cu°-Nb+-Al+ and Cu°-Fe+-Al+). The presence of copper metal species was detected (XPS analysis) and the catalysts which exhibited a high amount of Lewis acid sites showed higher DMF yield. The reaction pathways for HMF hydrogenation to produce DMF are investigated by following the above characterization and catalytic test results. Fig. 10 shows the product distribution for Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623 as a function of reaction time. Similar product distribution was obtained for Cu/Al2O3 (Fig. S6 (a)),Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-773 (Fig. S6 (b)), and Cu/Fe2O3-Al2O3 (Fig. S6 (c)). The main by-products were 2,5-bis (hydroxymethyl) furan (BHMF), 5-methyl-furfurylalcohol (AMF) and 5-methylfurfural (5-MF) which suggest that aldehyde group and hydroxyl groups could be hydrogenated at the same time and hydrogenolized, respectively in the first reaction step. As can be seen in Fig. 10, at the beginning of the reaction, BHMF was the major product with a yield of 80.7% at 30 min of reaction and its amount continuously decreased giving rise to AMF and consequently, this intermediate is converted into the desired product, DMF. Moreover, HMF can also be selectively hydrogenated into 5-MF producing AMF which is deoxygenated to DMF. Thus, the relative amount of 5-MF stays below 1% and it was postulated that DMF production via BHMF as a key intermediate is the dominating reaction pathway. Scheme 1 exhibits a possible pathway based on all detected by-products for Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623 catalyst. Side reactions include the formation of ring-opening and ring hydrogenation products such as 2‐methyl-tetrahydrofuran (MTHF) from DMF, 3-methyl-pentanal from 5-methylfurfural (5-MF) and 5-methyl-tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (MTHFA) from AMF. Also, there were other products from further hydrogenation: 3-methyl-1,2-cyclopentanediol, 2-methylcycopentanol, 1,4-pentadien-3-ol, 2,5-hexanedione, 2,5-hexanediol, hexanol, 2-pentenal, 3-methyl-4-penten-2-ol and crotyl alcohol. All these products (included in “others”) were present in less than 1% yield. On the other hand, for Cu/Fe2O3 only BHMF, 5-MF, AMF, and DMF were detected. As can be seen in Fig. 11 (a), BHMF was the main by-product while the DMF yield did not reach 10% for 10 h. 5-MF and AMF were also DMF intermediates but with low yield (Fig. 11 (a)). Kumalaputri et al. [63] investigated the conversion of HMF to BHMF and DMF using copper-doped porous metal oxides catalysts and they found a similar trend: the concentration of 5-MF was low during all time, which demonstrated that carbonyl group reduction happened faster than the loss of the hydroxyl group in HMF hydrogenation. For Cu/Nb2O5 catalyst the hydrogenolysis of the hydroxyl group of HMF to 5-MF followed by subsequent reduction to AMF and the consecutive DMF formation was the predominant reaction pathway (Fig. 11 (b)). The same reaction pathway was observed by Yepez et al. [64] and Gyngazova et al. [65] using Cu/SBA and Ni/C catalysts, respectively. The catalytic results suggested that the adequate dispersion of the metallic phase, the total acidity, and the nature of acid sites play a role in DMF yield. The investigated catalysts showed different natures of acid sites (Fig. 3) which can be associated with the product distribution. Catalysts with both Lewis and Brønsted sites (Cu/Al2O3, Cu/Fe2O3-Al2O3, Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623, and Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-773) presented the highest values of HMF conversion and DMF yield which was produced via BHMF. The same catalysts showed also high and intermediate total acidity values and metallic dispersion. Also, the presence of ring-opening and ring hydrogenation products can be related to strong acid sites [61]. Cu/Nb2O5 presented mainly weak and moderate acid sites which induced the formation of 5-MF and lower DMF yield as compared to niobia-alumina supported catalysts. For Cu/Fe2O3 catalyst, the presence of Brønsted acid sites resulted in a low DMF yield produced via BHMF and low HMF conversion. Therefore, we suggest that to reach high HMF conversion and DMF yield, a high contribution of Lewis acid sites along with a low of Brønsted acid sites is needed. This way, oxygen of carbonyl group of HMF is activated by the Lewis acid sites of catalyst support (Al+, Fe+, Nb+-Al+ or Fe+-Al+ species) and then metal promotes the hydrogenation of HMF to BHMF [62]. The presence of Cu0 species acted as the active hydrogenation sites in association with the Lewis acid sites. The oxygen of hydroxyl groups of BHMF is also activated by the Lewis acid sites followed by hydrogenolysis to produced AMF which is finally converted into DMF. Catalyst recycle experiments were also carried out. The catalysts were first separated from the residual liquid phase by filtration, washed successively with deionized water, dried at 393 K overnight and finally used for next run under the proposed reaction condition. Table 4 shows the reuse study of the investigated catalysts at 10 h of reaction. Cu/Al2O3 maintained the HMF conversion and DMF yield after it first use indicating good stability of the catalyst. Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623 and Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-773 reused catalysts exhibited identical HMF conversion but the DMF yield decreases from 84.5% to 49.5% and 87.7% to 65.5%, respectively. Although the DMF yield decreased, these catalysts have still produced only BHMF (major product) and DMF. Since no differences between the X-ray diffractograms of fresh and used catalysts (not shown) were observed, the decrease in DMF yield may have resulted from the deposition of components of the reaction mixture on the surface of active sites. TGA profiles of the spent catalysts (Fig. S7) showed ~20% of mass loss until 400 °C which probably corresponds to the decomposition of organic species adsorbed on catalyst surface as also suggested by An et al. [24] and Gyngazova et al. [65]. However, we also cannot exclude sintering or active phase oxidation as the causes of DMF yield decrease. Iron-containing catalysts showed a severe deactivation. The X-ray diffractograms of Cu/Fe2O3-Al2O3 and Cu/Fe2O3 after their first run showed significant differences from those of fresh catalyst (Fig. S8). After their first run, no diffraction peaks of α-Fe2O3 (JCPDS 87–1166) have been observed due to their reduction to Fe3O4 (JCPDS 88–0315) and FeO (77–2355) by H2 used in catalytic tests. These results suggest an increase in the degree of copper and Al2O3 coverages (θ) by Fe2O3 and a decrease of total acidity. Thus, low conversion and HMF yield were obtained. Cu/Nb2O5 was not stable possibly due to the partial reduction of niobia (observed in TPR results) and consequently the reduction of its acidity. Cu/Al2O3, Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623, Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-773 showed great potential in HMF conversion. A high yield of DMF (~90.0%) was obtained with a low quantity of ring-hydrogenation products (<1%). These results were similar and in some cases better than those obtained with noble-metal catalysts [5,12], bimetallic catalysts including copper [10], higher copper content [61] and severe reaction conditions (temperature and pressure) [7]. For example, Zhang et al. [26] carried out the hydrogenation of HMF to DMF using Cu catalysts with methanol as a hydrogen donor over Cu-based catalysts. Cu/Al2O3, which showed 75% of DMF yield under temperatures of the reaction above those used in this work (493–533 K). This result was attributed to the smallest Cu crystallite size and the highest acidity of Cu/Al2O3. On the other hand, Mhadmhan et al [17] used Cu − Pd bimetallic catalysts supported on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) for the selective hydrogenation of HMF to DMF using 2-propanol as hydrogen donor under continuous flow conditions. The 10Cu-1Pd/RGO system presented 96% of HMF conversion and 95% DMF yield under the following reaction conditions: 413–473 K, 0.05 M HMF in 2-propanol, 0.2 mL/min, 30 bar pressure and 2 h on stream. The authors detected the formation of a Pd − Cu alloy, which could contribute both for the catalytic activity and stability."
8,Conclusions,"Copper supported catalysts have been investigated as catalysts for HMF hydrogenation to produce DMF which is considered as a highly interesting biofuel. The use of different supports played an important role in the activities and selectivities of the catalysts for HMF hydrogenation. High copper dispersion together with Lewis acid sites was crucial for the activation of oxygen of hydroxyl groups in HMF and BHMF promoting formation DMF. Moderate to high total acidity along with the presence of metallic copper are also crucial. The present work shows that HMF hydrogenation over copper supported catalysts can be performed with high activity under mild reaction conditions. Cu/Al2O3, Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-623, Cu/Nb2O5-Al2O3-773, and Cu/Fe2O3-Al2O3 catalysts provided promising DMF yield (~90%) with full conversion (100%) in 10 h of reaction. On the other hand, Cu/Fe2O3 and Cu/Nb2O5 which showed low total acidity (0.13 and 0.15 mol NH3/gcat,) and, lower dispersion and high particle size (Cu/Fe2O3) did not present a significant DMF production. Except for Cu/Nb2O5, catalytic tests showed that DMF production occurs via BHMF as a key intermediate. Alumina and niobia-alumina supported catalysts show great potential in HMF conversion as they consist of environmentally benign catalysts, earth-abundant, and relatively inexpensive materials."
