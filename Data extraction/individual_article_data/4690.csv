0,Introduction,"Contaminations of excess levels of nitrates, organic matter, solids, pathogens, salts, and odorous/volatile compounds in wastewater streams are often linked with dairy manure. In addition to these contaminations, emerging antibiotic residues in dairy waste is a public concern [1]. Antibiotics are used in dairy industry at various levels as feed additives for protection of animal health, and a substantial portion of these antibiotics are excreted through either urine or feces. Tetracycline (TC) is one of the most common antibiotics widely used in dairy industry, and it was also reportedly used as a growth promoter because of its low price, and broad-spectrum antibacterial effect [2]. However, more than 90% of the TC is not metabolized and excreted through feces and urine [3]. Previous studies reported the presence of TC in surface and ground water [4]. The presence of antibiotic residues in ambient water bodies may kill aquatic organisms and can also trigger the spread of microorganisms with antibiotic resistance genes [5]. Therefore, identifying the technology for the removal of antibiotic residues such as TC from the animal wastes, which are considered as a potential source of antibiotic residues, can be vital for controlling the contaminants released to the environment. Previous studies have attempted to develop various methods such as oxidation [6], electrochemical methods [7] and biological treatments [8] for TC removal from wastewater. While many advantages were reported for these methods, common challenges of the low removal efficiency, high cost and difficulties in application exist [9]. In comparison to these techniques, removal of TC by adsorption processes is considered to be more economic and easier in applications [2]. Currently, the most commonly used adsorbents are biochar [10], nanofiber/porous biochar [11], mesoporous silica [12], BiVO4/Bi2Ti2O7/Fe3O4 nanoparticles [13] and magnetite nanoparticles [14]. The limitations of these adsorbents are high-pressure drops in the filtration system, difficulties in separation from adsorption solutions [15], and low throughput, which hinder the application at a large-scale. To develop a robust treatment method for TC removal from the wastewater, we investigated the use of nanofibrous membranes (NFM) as a filtering adsorbent. The NFM provides unique features such as tunable tortuous open-porous structure, easy separation and physical stability [16], which has a potential to remove TC efficiently through a filtration process and can be used at a large-scale. Previous studies attempted to develop the NFM as TC adsorbents by using Fe3O4/polyacrylonitrile composite NFM [17] and chitosan/poly(vinyl alcohol) [18]. Issues such as low mechanical strength, low adsorption efficiency, poor selectivity, complex production process, and high cost were reported with these NFMs [17]. Many of these adsorbents are based on covalent bonding, which creates strong interactions and poor elution [19]. Metal chelation-based adsorbents showed improved specificity, stability, and strength. Furthermore, adsorption via metal coordination is a relatively fast process which could be specifically meaningful for removal of TC through filtration adsorption. The TC is able to form stable metal–ligand complex due to the presence of acetamides, and phenolic-diketone moieties [20]. These electron rich groups are being stabilized by complexing with transition metals. We attempted to design NFM TC adsorbent based on metal chelation binding property to improve the performance of the NFM in terms of adsorption rate, selectivity, and removal capacity. The introduction of highly active functional groups such as PAni can improve the adsorption capacity of metal ligand and TC due to the presence of multiple amine groups and there interactions with Cu2+ [21–23]. Polyaniline (PAni) is a conjugated polymer with excellent chemical and thermal stability and exhibits potential π-π interactions with TC aromatic rings. Poly (vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene) (EVOH) NFM provides hydrophilicity, water insolubility and chemical stability. The designed NFM with polyaniline (PAni) growing on surfaces of the EVOH nanofibers under HCl (EVOH/PAni-Cl NFM) or phytic acid (Phy) (EVOH/PAni-Cl NFM) will chelate with Cu2+ to form EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ and EVOH/PAni-Cl NFM-Cu2+ NFMs, respectively, with desired surface wettability, stability, and structural and chemical stability for efficient TC adsorption within short time."
1,Material and method,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Poly (vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene) (EVOH) with (32 mol % ethylene content) was purchased from Acros Chemical (Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Aniline (Ani) (98%), HCl (37%), phytic acid (Phy) (50% w/w), linear polyethyleneimine (PEI), imidazole (99%), Ammonium persulfate (APS) (98.5%), copper sulfate (CuSO4·6H2O) (99%), enrofloxacin (ENRO) (98%), propranolol (POL) (99%) and ofloxacin (Ofx) (99%), tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) (98%), oxytetracycline (OTC) (98%) and chlorotetracycline (CTC) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, Co. USA. Isopropanol was purchased from Honeywell-Fluka (70%). In all experiments, deionized water (DI) was used. All chemicals and solvents were used without further purification."
3,Fabrication of EVOH nanofibrous membranes (EVOH-NFM),"2.2 Fabrication of EVOH nanofibrous membranes (EVOH-NFM) An 8% of EVOH copolymer was dissolved in 70% isopropanol mixture for 8 hrs at 60 °C in a water bath. The prepared EVOH solution was loaded into 10-mL plastic syringes with tubular metal needles. The electrospinning process took place at room temperature with a spinning rate of 4 mL hr−1, voltage 30 kV, and a distance of 23 cm from spinneret to a membrane collector rotating at speed of 100 rpm. The resultant EVOH NFM were dried at 50 °C for 16 hrs."
4,Synthesis of chlorinated and phytic acid doped (EVOH/PAni-Cl) and (EVOH/PAni-Phy) NFM.,"2.3 Synthesis of chlorinated and phytic acid doped (EVOH/PAni-Cl) and (EVOH/PAni-Phy) NFM. To form a hierarchical EVOH/PAni-Cl NFM or EVOH/PAni-Phy NFM, aniline was first polymerized on surfaces of nanofibers in EVOH NFM to form polyaniline (PAni) nanodots on the NFM (EVOH/PAni NFM) via a modified chemical oxidative polymerization and simultaneously doped by the acids to form EVOH/PAni-Cl NFM or EVOH/PAni-Phy NFM, respectively by using different acids [24]. Initially, 1 mmol of HCl or 8 mmol of Phy were dissolved with 9 mmol of aniline monomer in 10 mL of deionized (DI) water (Solution A). Subsequently, 10 pieces of 2 × 2 cm EVOH NFM were mixed with solution A for 10 min. Afterwards, 6 mL of a cold APS solution (0.004 M) (solution B) was added dropwise under vigorous mixing. Immediately after mixing, polymerization was carried out at a reaction temperature of 4 °C for 24 hrs. The synthesized EVOH/PAni-Cl NFM or EVOH/PAni-Phy NFM were rinsed with DI for 12 hrs and dried for further use."
5,Preparation of EVOH/PAni-Cu2+ NFM,"2.4 Preparation of EVOH/PAni-Cu2+ NFM 10 Pieces of EVOH/PAni-Cl and EVOH/PAni-Phy NFM with dimensions (2 × 2 cm) were transferred into a CuSO4.6 H2O solution (1000 ppm); pH 6.3 was adjusted by adding (0.1 M of HCl or 0.1 M of NaOH). The mixture was magnetically stirred for 12 hrs. The amount of chelated Cu2+ was measured by following a testing protocol. 900 µL of residual Cu2+ solutions were mixed with 100 µL of 2% PEI solution [25,26], and the mixture was diluted to 2 mL with DI and the absorbance was measured using a UV–visible spectrophotometer at a wavelength 625 nm. The concentration of remaining CuSO4 was determined from a calibration curve measured by using varied concentrations of Cu2+ from a mixture of 900 µL CuSO4.6 H2O with 100 µL of 2% PEI (Fig. S1). All adsorption experiments were repeated 3 times."
6,TC adsorption efficiency measurements.,"2.5 TC adsorption efficiency measurements. The adsorption experiments were conducted using the batch mode. The TC solutions with different concentrations (20, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400 and 500 ppm) were prepared by dispersing varied amounts of TC in 10 mL of DI water. Then 10 mg of the EVOH/PAni-Cl NFM or EVOH/PAni-Phy NFM was immersed in the TC solution (10 mL) for a predetermined time at room temperature. Subsequently, the membranes were taken out and washed several times with DI water to remove any nonspecifically adsorbed TC. Finally, all the solutions were collected to measure the amount of TC. All sample tubes or flasks were wrapped with aluminum foil to inhibit any potential photo-degradation. All adsorption experiments were repeated 3 times, and error ranges were estimated in each measurement. The concentration of TC in the solution was measured using a UV–visible spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 300–400 nm (according to pH of TC solution) and adsorption amount was calculated using the following equation (1): (1) qt = (C0 − Ct) V/m where C0 is initial concentration of TC mg mL−1, Ct is the TC concentration at time (t), V is the volume of the solution (L) and m is the weight of membrane in (g). The pH of solutions was adjusted using 0.1 M HCl or 0.1 M NaOH. Ionic strengths of the solutions were adjusted by adding various concentrations (0.1–1 M) of NaCl. Moreover, isothermal studies were conducted by variation of TC initial concentrations and applying Langmuir and Freundlich models that are expressed in the following equations (2) and (3) [27,28]: Freundlich: (2) Log qe = log Kf + 1/n log Ce where Kf (mg g−1) (L mg−1) and 1/n are Freundlich constants related to adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity of the adsorbent, respectively. Ce is the equilibrium concentration of TC (mg L−1). A favorable adsorption is expected when 1 < n < 10, which is improved further when 1/n < 1. Langmuir: (3) C e q e = 1 q m k L + C e q m where Ce is the equilibrium concentration of TC (mg L−1), qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity (mg g−1), kL is the Langmuir adsorption constant (L mg−1) and qm is the maximum adsorption amount (mg g−1), which can be obtained from the slope and intercept of Ce /qe versus Ce plot. The kinetics studies were investigated by measuring TC adsorption capacity at various time intervals (5–300 min.) and applying pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic. Elovich and intra-particle models [27,29] were employed with TC initial concentration of 250 ppm, and pH 6.5 at room temperature [equations (4)–(7)]: pseudo-first-order: (4) q t = q e 1 - 1 t e k 1 pseudo-second-order: (5) q t = k 2 q e 2 1 + k 2 q e t The intra-particle diffusion model equation is presented in the following equation (6): (6) q t = K i t 1 / 2 + C Elovich model equation (7) is: (7) q t = 1 / β ln β α + 1 / β l n t where qt is the adsorption amount at a given contact time; qe is the calculated saturation capacity, k1 and k2 , ki , C and α and β are relevant adsorption rate constants of the three models, and t is the given adsorption time."
7,"Selectivity, reusability, and dynamic adsorption performance.","2.6 Selectivity, reusability, and dynamic adsorption performance. The TC selectivity of EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ NFM was studied by investigating its adsorption performance with coexistence of 20 ppm of TC, CTC, OTC, ENRO, POL and Ofx in manure wastewater. The adsorbed amounts of the various antibiotic solutions were determined using a spectrophotometer at the wavelengths of 355 nm (TC), 365 nm (CTC), 360 nm (OTC), 282 nm (ENRO), 290 nm (POL) and 294 nm (Ofx), respectively [30,31]. The regeneration of the used NFM was carried out by desorbing TC in a mixture solution of 1:9 acetic acid and methanol [32]. After that, these membranes were washed with DI for three times then dried. To evaluate chelated Cu2+ stability, the amount of discharged Cu2+ ions from EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ NFM during adsorption process was measured by a Low Range Copper Colorimeter – Checker® Handheld Colorimeter (HC) sensor. The dynamic adsorption performance was investigated by fixing 5 layers of the NFM with an accumulation thickness of about 0.5 mm in a plastic filter syringe column with a diameter of 15 mm. Subsequently, 20 mL of 50 ppm TC solution in pH 6.7 was poured into the column continuously, and the solution flowed through the membranes slowly. The TC concentrations of the effluent solutions were immediately measured every 2 mL until it arrived the initial value. All the operations were carried out under a stable pressure drop of gravity (about 750 Pa) which was controlled by keeping a same liquid level. For field (real world) sample measurements, liquid manure samples were collected from three dairy farms in Central Valley California, USA. These samples were mixed to form composite samples for testing the TC removal performance of EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ NFM. Liquid manure samples were first treated by a flocculant developed to precipitate suspended manure. After particle separation, EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ NFMs (10 mg mL−1) were immersed in 10 mL of each sample (without any dilution or pH changes) for 60 min. The TC concentration was measured at different time intervals. All adsorption experiments were repeated 3 times and error ranges were estimated in each measurement."
8,Material characterization,"2.7 Material characterization The morphological structures of NFMs were characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Philips FEI XL30) operated at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. The changes of the functional groups of various NFM were obtained by using a Nicolet 6700 Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (ThermoFisher, USA) in the range of 500–4000 cm−1. The membranes (2–3 mg) were ground with 198 mg KBr and pressed into a pellet, and transmissional FTIR spectra were measured from 500 to 4000 cm−1. The thermal stability evaluation was measured using Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA)-60 system (Shimadzu Science Instruments, Inc., USA). ASAP 2020 analyzer (USA) was applied to characterize the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the Brunauer-Emmett Teller (BET) surface area of NFMs. The water contact angles (WCA) was measured for 2 × 2 cm2 of each NFM using a contact angle measuring device 1.3MP Handheld Digital Microscope (Dino-Lite, USA)."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Characterizations,"3.1 Characterizations An overall preparation scheme of the designed EVOH/PAni NFM doped with Phy or HCl is illustrated in Fig. 1 a. The aim of using different dopants is to investigate the effect of organic and inorganic acids on morphology of the formed PAni hierarchical structures and to achieve the maximum adsorption capacity for TC pollutant. The smooth surfaces of the fibers in the microporous EVOH NFM with an average fiber diameter 480 nm (Fig. 1b) were clearly changed to PAni nanodots due to the in-situ polymerization of aniline under the doping acids. SEM images (Fig. 1c,d) reveal even covering of the PAni nanodots on the surfaces of nanofibers in the EVOH/PAni-Cl NFM with increased average diameters of the fibers, similar to results in literature [33]. The morphology of the PAni nanodots was strongly affected by the doping acid [34]. In case of organic acid (Phy) as a dopant, the morphology of the EVOH/PAni-Phy was slightly different from the one doped with HCl, in a scale-like structure appeared in Fig. 1e. The nanodot hierarchical structures of the NFMs is dramatically improve increase surface active areas owing to the synergistic effect of nanofibers and active PAni-Cl nanodots (Fig. S2). Both PAni grown on the nanofibers of the EVOH/PAni-Cl and EVOH/PAni-Phy NFM increased diameters of the fibers to about 500 nm and 510 nm, respectively. Furthermore, the chemical compositions of the NFMs were measured by using EDX to confirm presence of acid groups in EVOH/PAni-Cl and EVOH/PAni-Phy NFM, respectively. The appearance of peaks at 2.8 Kev and 2 Kev for Cl− and P (Fig. 1f, g) suggests that Cl− and P were doped on to PAni from HCl and Phy, respectively. The successful assembling of PAni on EVOH surface was confirmed by FTIR (Fig. 1h). The new absorption peaks at 1330 cm−1, 1500 cm−1 and 1240 cm−1 for EVOH/PAni-Cl NFM or EVOH/PAni-Phy NFM are characteristics of CN+ and CN quinone nitrogen with aromatic conjugation [35], respectively. Those new peaks implied that PAni is in a form of emeraldine salts [36]. FTIR results can be another evidence of effective dopping of PAni by Phy with formation of EVOH/PAni-Phy NFM. The appearance of new peaks at 1180 cm−1 and 1600 cm−1 ascribed to symmetrical vibration of POC, and stretching vibration of PO, respectively, which are absent in EVOH/PAni-Cl. It is worth to mention that Phy characteristic peak intensities were enhanced by increasing (Phy) concentration from 1 to 12% (Fig. S3), indicating the successful Phy doping. Fig. 1i–k reveals the reduced water contact angles (WCA) of the NFMs from 100° (EVOH NFM) to 66° (EVOH/PAni-Cl NFM), and 50° (EVOH/PAni-Phy NFM), respectively. The reduced WCA of EVOH/PAni-phy NFM was due to the existence of hydrophilic Phy protonated PAni, making the EVOH/PAni-Phy NFM more hydrophilic. The changes in water wetting properties of the NFMs can serve as evidence of the effective formation of strong adhesive PAni layer doped by Phy or HCl."
11,Optimization of copper ion adsorption,"3.2 Optimization of copper ion adsorption To improve TC adsorption efficiency, Cu2+ ions were incorporated on to surfaces of the EVOH/PAni NFMs through metal a chelation interaction. The amount of adsorbed Cu2+ can be enhanced by optimizing Ani, Phy or HCl concentrations in preparation processes. Fig. 2 a shows that the Cu2+ adsorption capacity of the EVOH/PAni-Phy NFM could be improved from 120 mg g−1 to 280 mg g−1 by increasing Ani initial concentration from 1 to 5 mmol, respectively, due to increased chelation centers (NH) in PAni formed on the surfaces of NFMs [37,38]. The effective Cu2+ adsorption on the NFM was confirmed by the appearance of a peak at 8 about Kev in EDX analysis of the EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ NFM (Fig. S4a), a characteristic for Cu2+, and the improved thermal stability (Fig. S4b) of the EVOH/PAni-Cl NFM before and after Cu2+ adsorption. The main initial weight loss at 350 °C was associated with PAni backbone decomposition [39]. The increased residue amount at 600 °C was related to the Cu2+ ions chelated onto the EVOH/PAni-Cl NFM. The pH condition in chelation solution has significant influences on Cu+2 chelation efficiency, and the results are shown in Fig. 2b. Overall, Cu2+ binding capacity increased with increasing pH for both EVOH/PAni-Cl and EVOH/PAni-Phy from acidic to neutral and reached maximum efficiency of 230 mg g−1 and 280 mg g−1 at pH 7.2 and 6, respectively. This behavior is consistent with ionization nature of PAni-Cl and PAni-Phy, which is illustrated in Fig. 2c. The PKa values of Phy are 1.5, 5.6 and 7.5, corresponding to PKa1, PKa2, PKa3, respectively. The dihydrogen phosphate form of Phy becomes more negatively charged hydrogen phosphate when pH value of the solution is above the PKa, which could bind more Cu2+ ions [40]. At pH > 8, PAni emeraldine salt should be converted to PAni-base [41], which increases free imino N lone pair that may chelate with Cu2+ as well. However, results revealed a significant drop in adsorption capacity from pH 7–10 (Fig. 2b), due to the precipitation of Cu(OH)2 under alkaline conditions [42]. Moreover, Cu2+ adsorption amount was also affected by other parameters such as adsorption time and initial Cu2+ (Fig. S5a,b)."
12,Investigation and optimization of TC adsorption performance,"3.3 Investigation and optimization of TC adsorption performance Based on literature results, the EVOH/PAni NFMs could possess following adsorptive interactions with TC, depending on the existence of the doping and copper chelating structures (Fig. 3 a, S5): (i) π-π stacking interaction between TC and PAni aromatic rings as a dominant driving force [43]; (ii) cation–π bonding [dominated between the cation +NH(CH3)2 on TC and π–electron-rich aromatic structure of PAni [44], however, these π interactions could be highly weakened by steric effect between TC and Phy (Fig. S6); (iii) anionic exchange between TC negative residue and dopant acid (Phy or Cl−) on the membranes; (iv) ionic bonding between positive TC +NH(CH3)2 and negative phytate phosphate groups [45] (acid-base interaction between cationic species or residue of cationic/zwitterionic TC and the basic imino N lone pair of PAni [46]); and (v) metal chelation of Cu2+ on the PAni of the membranes with TC carboxylic and hydroxyl groups [47].The structures of the NFMs provide sites for strong metal complexation and electrostatic interactions. The original EVOH NFMs showed a relatively low TC adsorption capacity (<150 mg g−1) through H-bond, pore diffusion and Vander wales forces. However, EVOH/PAni-Cl, EVOH/PAni-Phy, EVOH/PAni-Phy-Cu2+ and EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ showed much high adsorption capacities of TC at 580 mg g−1, 630 mg g−1, 550 mg g−1and 1100 mg g−1, respectively (Fig. 3b) because of the introductions of both metal chelation and electrostatic interactions as discussed in the proposed mechanism. The increase of initial concentration of Ani from 1 and 5 mmol could result in more PAni nanodots formed on the surfaces of EVOH fibers and increased adsorption capacity of EVOH/PAni-Cl NFM from 200 mg g−1 to 820 mg g−1 (Fig. 3c). These results confirmed the critical role of π-π stacking interactions between TC as an electron-acceptor and PAni aromatic rings as an electron-donner. However, the adsorption capability noticeably reduced to 510 mg g−1 with the further increase in Ani initial concentration above 5 mmol due to formation of large rough structures on EVOH surface, leading to reduced PAni surfaces that can interact with TC (Fig. S7a-c). The TC adsorption capacity could be improved by increasing Phy initial concentration due to the increasing amount of negatively charged phosphate groups that could enhance the electrostatic interaction with positively charged residues TC (TCH3 +) in solutions in proper pH ranges. The maximum adsorption capacity was 530 mg g−1 at the initial Phy concentration of 10% (Fig. 3d). The adsorption efficiency was unchanged even at high concentration of Phy due to unfavorable steric hindrance between bulky TC and Phy molecules [48]. In case of the EVOH/PAni-Cl NFM, increased HCl concentration improved TC adsorption to reach a maximum value of 850 mg g−1 (Fig. 3e), mainly due to increasing anion exchange centers of TC replacing Cl−. The increment of chelated Cu2+enhanced the formation of stable metal complexes between TC, acetamides (C2), phenolic b-diketone moieties (C10, C11, C12) of TC and Cu2+ centers [49]. The EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ and EVOH/PAni-Phy-Cu2+ adsorption capacity reached to the maximum of 1200 mg g−1 and 600 mg g−1, respectively (Fig. S8), by increasing initial Cu2+ concentration to 1000 ppm. Although EVOH/PAni-Phy NFM exhibited higher TC adsorption efficiency than EVOH/PAni-Cl NFM due to numerous negative dihydrogen phosphate groups that provide a strong affinity to cationic residue of TC, the adsorption capacities of the EVOH/PAni-Phy-Cu2+ were consistently lower than that of the EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+. This behavior can be explained based on the stability constant value of TC-Cu2+ (8.37) which is greater than that of Phy-Cu2+ value of 2.14 [50]. The formation of water-soluble TC-Cu2+ complex is considered to be more favorable than ionic interacting with Phy [51], which leads to the leakage of adsorbed Cu2+ ions from EVOH/PAni-Phy-Cu2+. This result suggests that the EVOH/PAni-Cl NFM is more favorable in removal of TC in wastewater streams and confirms the suggested reaction mechanisms."
13,Adsorption kinetics and isothermal studies of TC on EVOH/PAni NFMs,"3.4 Adsorption kinetics and isothermal studies of TC on EVOH/PAni NFMs Fig. 4 a illustrates the adsorption amounts of TC on both EVOH/PAni-Cl and EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ NFMs versus exposure times, which were increased sharply in the first 10–75 min. Subsequently, the adsorption process transformed into a slow-stage and steadily approached to equilibrium stage after prolonged exposure of 120 min. Saturated TC adsorption capacities of 1200 mg g−1 and 580 mg g−1 were obtained from the EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ and EVOH/PAni-Cl NFMs, respectively. The improved adsorption kinetics were a result of combined accessible chelated Cu2+ groups on the EVOH NFM and numerous PAni chains, providing both rapid π-π adsorption [52,53] and physical (H-bond) interactions [54]. The influence of the initial TC concentrations on adsorption capacity of the EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ NFM provided guidelines for its practical application (Fig. 4b). The adsorption efficiency reached to the maximum adsorption capacity of 1200 mg g−1 at the initial TC concentration of 250 ppm. These results are consistent with the suggested π-π interaction mechanism, at which adsorbed molecules are parallel to each other [55]. Therefore, the availability of the abundant parallel TC molecules enhanced the diffusion of the TC into the interior of the microporous NFM. To investigate mechanism and patterns of the adsorption processes, kinetic models (pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order), intra-particle and Elovich kinetics models and kinetic parameter values were compared in Table S1. The correlation coefficient (R2 ) values of the models suggest that pseudo-second-order model fitted better (Fig. 4c) than the pseudo-first-order (Fig. S9a), which suggests that chemisorption process may be the rate limiting step in the adsorption processes [9]. The adsorption rate constants k2 are similar in the presence and absence of chelated Cu2+ on the NFMs. However, the Langmuir equilibrium adsorption capacity (qe ) of the EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ was greater than that of the EVOH/PAni-Cl NFM due to the availability of the former in various modes of the interactions. The adsorption of TC on the EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ showed R2 (0.97) for the Elovich model (Fig. 4d), revealing mixed adsorption mechanisms with heterogenous activation energy [56]. Moreover, an intra-particle diffusion model was employed to provide additional insights on the proposed diffusion mechanism in the nanofibrous structures (Fig. S9b). The intra-particle diffusion model showed two linear stages, the first stage represents the external mass transfer of TC from aqueous solution to the adsorbent which occurs in the first 90 min. The second stage is attributed to intrafiber transport of TC within the inner nanofiber adsorbent surfaces at an equilibrium state. The k1 was significantly higher than k2 (Table S1), which suggests that the diffusion was the rate determining factor [57]. Moreover, isothermal models (Langmuir and Freundlich models) were implemented in Fig. 4e, f, and results showed that the isothermal parameters were fitted well with the homogeneous monolayer adsorption process of Langmuir isotherm model R2 (0.98). This indicates that the TC adsorption on the surfaces of the NFMs is monolayer. The TC adsorption on these EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ NFM reached to the equilibrium at a faster rate with superior qm values compared with previously reported adsorbents in Table 1 . The open and porous nanofibrous membranes, ultrahigh surfaces areas of the hierarchical nanofibrous structures, and multi-adsorption mechanisms, and the accessible function groups provided the unique structural features of the EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ NFM and superior performance in adsorption of TC."
14,"Effects of pH, ionic strength, and adsorbent dose","3.5 Effects of pH, ionic strength, and adsorbent dose The effect of the adsorbent EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ NFM dosages was studied to obtain maximum removal efficiency (Fig. 5 a). The adsorption capacity increases with increased adsorbent amount in the system and reached to maximum removal of 95% and 80% using 2 mg g−1 EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ NFM and EVOH/PAni-Cl NFM, respectively, at 25 ppm initial TC concentration. Higher concentration of TC in solutions reduced the removal rates due to the potential saturations of the sites on the NFMs. Ionic strength of the solutions could affect adsorption and consequently the removal of TC, which was regulated using varied NaCl concentrations (0 to 1.0 M). Fig. 5b demonstrated that the adsorption capacity of TC on the EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ NFM slightly reduced with NaCl concentrations changing from 0.1 to 1.0 M, then, became flattened when NaCl concentration was further raised (1.0–1.2 M). The adsorptions of TC on the EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ NFM are mainly attributed to the π-π interaction and inner sphere metal complexation, which are hardly affected by ionic strength of the media [31,60]. However, electrostatic interaction between TC and the NFM could be weakened by the increase of Na+ and Cl− ions, resulting in certain electrostatic shielding effect [61], which is the reason of slight decreases of the TC adsorption capacities. The optimal pH of the solution is vital for applying of the EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ in the application. Fig. 5c shows that the adsorption capacity improved by increasing pH from 3 to 6.5, at which the adsorption reached to a maximum capacity of 1200 mg g−1. The low adsorption capacity at the pH < 3.5 was due to potential leaching of the chelated Cu2+ ions into the solution under increased acidity, which greatly decreased the TC adsorption on the NFM [62]. Based on amphoteric nature of TC, which exhibits different electrical properties in various pH ranges (Fig. S10a), the repulsion force existed between TC+ and PAni (NH+) center under acidic condition (Fig. 5d). The TC changes its conformation to a twisted structure in acidic medium [63] (Fig. S10b), which apparently changes the metal binding efficiency [64]. The adsorption capacity noticeably improved at pH range (4.5–6.5). At this pH range, TC exists in a zwitterionic ion form with both +NH(CH3)2 positive and deprotonated phenolic negative residues [65] (Fig. 5d). The zwitterionic structure enhances the electrostatic interactions. Further increase of pH > 9 increased the negative charges on TC and reduced the anion exchange, cation-π and ionic interactions due to conversion of PAni+Cl− to PAni in the base form [66]."
15,"Reusability, dynamic breakthrough, and performance of NFMs on field manure samples","3.6 Reusability, dynamic breakthrough, and performance of NFMs on field manure samples To assess the reusability and mechanical stability of the EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ NFM, an elution solution of 1:9 acetic acid: methanol was used to release TC from the NFMs. As illustrated in Fig. 6 a, the TC adsorption capacities of the NFMs were not changed significantly. Moreover, SEM images of the NFM after 6 cycles of adsorption-elution showed intact hierarchical PAni-Cl and porous 3D NFM structures (Fig. 6a). Moreover, the Cu2+ complex stability was evidenced by appearance of peak at 1620 cm−1 in FTIR spectrum after the adsorption (Fig. S11a), indicating a copper–amine interaction, as well as the appearance of the peak at 1750 cm−1 for CO amide of TC. Moreover, the characteristic peak of 8 Kev in EDX analysis (Fig. S11b) serves as the evidence for Cu2+ stability on EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ NFM surface. Such a robust recyclability of the obtained membrane could be ascribed to its chemical and physical stability. The good reuse performance of the EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ NFM meets the requirement for the multiple uses and enhances its potential for a practical application for wastewater treatment. The Cu2+ in the NFMs could be released due to the repeated applications, which was also measured via a low Range Copper Colorimeter and found at 0.5 ppm and 0.6 ppm after adsorption process at pH 6, and 7, respectively. Both are lower than the allowed limit set by WHO (0.8 ppm) in consumable water [67]. The EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ NFM seems suitable for treatment of manure water which has a pH range of 6–7.8 [54]. Fig. 6b illustrates the typical dynamic breakthrough curve of manure water spiked with 50 ppm of TC passing through the EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ NFM. The effluent concentration of TC increased gradually with increasing elution volume and reached to the initial concentration 50 ppm after elution of 18 mL from a total elution volume of 20 mL. The dynamic binding capacity of the NFM was calculated as 400 mg g−1, which was approximately 84% of the maximum static adsorption capacity. This adsorption rate was due to the high surface area available for TC adsorption provided by PAni hierarchically grown and porous NFM, interactions as π-π stacking, and metal chelation. Animal wastes may contain various antibiotics, therefore, the application of the NFM can provide an option for antibiotic removal during wastewater treatment. We studied the adsorption ability of the developed NFM for removal of tetracycline antibiotics (TC, CTC, and OTC) in manure wastewater. Fig. 6c illustrates that the EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ presented a distinctive selectivity towards antibiotics which have ability to chelate to Cu2+. The adsorption capability of the membrane towards three TC derivatives and ENRO was superior to that of Ofx and POL, indication of major adsorptions of the chemicals on the NFMs by means of π-π and hydrogen bonding interactions. The lack of specific groups in both Ofx and POL that could form metal complexation with Cu ions in the NFMs makes the difference. This concept was confirmed by less selectivity of the EVOH/PAni-Cl NFM to TC over Ofx. Moreover, both EVOH/PAni-Cl and EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ showed higher TC affinity than to CTC, which may be due to the different molecular configurations of TC, CTC and OTC that are present as arch and in distorted configurations. This leads to the increase in gaps between PAni and TC [48], reducing π-π interaction strength. These results indicate that the developed EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ NFM can be used for simultaneous extraction of all tetracycline derivatives. The metal-complexation ability, and π-π and ionic interactions have a pivotal role in selective removal of TCs. As applicability is an important evaluation index for separation and waste treatment studies, we conducted a series of separation studies using real manure samples collected from dairy farms (liquid manure samples from dairy farms in Central Valley California, USA). The two samples with different TC content (25 ppm Sample 1 and 50 ppm Sample 2) with a solid content (suspended manure particles) of 1.7%. The detailed contents of the manure samples are shown in Table S1. Fig. 6d shows that adsorption capacity of the NFM was not affected by the solid content. The adsorption capacity was 300 mg g−1 and 390 mg g−1 or 86% and 80% for samples 1 and 2, respectively. The required time for adsorption was 60 min. These results are comparable with the efficiency of the aqueous TC solutions."
16,Conclusion,"In conclusion, a hierarchical EVOH NFM composite with effective TC adsorption was successfully prepared by in situ formation of PAni on surfaces of nanofibers in EVOH NFM under acidic medium. Phytic acid as an organic acid and hydrochloric acid as mineral one were used as a doping agent to cationize PAni structures on the NFMs and enhance interactions with copper ion (Cu2+) and subsequently with tetracycline in wastewater. SEM, EDX, and FTIR characterization of EVOH/PAni-Cl and EVOH/PAni-Phy NFMs confirmed successful doping of chlorine and phytic acid, respectively. EVOH/PAni-Cl NFM revealed nanodots structure that could provide increased active surface areas and facilitate easy access of target TC molecules. Moreover, copper ions were incorporated onto the NFMs by chelation with PAni structure to improve the TC adsorption efficiency of both EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ and EVOH/PAni-Phy-Cu2+ NFMs. The EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ NFM exhibited markedly enhanced TC adsorption than EVOH/PAni-Phy-Cu2+ NFM. The EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ NFM presented chemical and physical stability after 8 repeated adsorption cycles, confirmed by EDX, SEM and FTIR analysis as well as measured Cu2+ (0.5 ppm) in leaching out solutions. The assembled EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ NFM demonstrated TC removal of 86% from dairy manure samples within 60 min. This behavior with such wastewater category suggests EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ as a promising adsorbent. The multi-adsorption mechanism played an important role in fast and efficient TC uptake. These unique features suggest EVOH/PAni-Cl-Cu2+ NFM more efficient than other adsorbent matrix as nanoparticles or membrane with pressure drop and handling issues. We envision that functionalized NFMs could find applications in separation and removal of various such as (dyes, other antibiotics, Volatile organic compounds), gas sensors benefiting from PAni conductivity, or efficient matrix for metal organic framework loading."
