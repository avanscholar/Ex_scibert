0,Introduction,"Due to high-energy yield (122 kJ/g) and non-polluting nature, hydrogen (H2) is deemed to be a promising fuel for future; and is produced by the reactions of natural gas or light oil fractions with steam at high temperatures [1]. Alternatively, using renewable resources and with microbial capacity for biological routes of H2 production are gaining importance. Among them dark-fermentation process was reported to have advantages due to the feasibility of utilizing wastewater as substrate [2–4]. One such source of wastewater is molasses-based distilleries, which generate 8–15 L of wastewater per liter of ethanol produced [5]. Ethanol is emerging as one of future biofuels, in that scenario the utilization of waste from the distilleries for hydrogen production would affect the overall economics of this industry. Microbes can produce hydrogen by either fermentation [6] or photosynthesis [7]. Hydrogen production by fermentation has been extensively studied on several pure cultures [8,9] viz. Firmicutes [10–14] and Enterobacteria [15,16]. However, in case of wastewater where the carbon source could be diverted for secondary metabolism, it is difficult to control the biological processes. In this study operational conditions like HRT and organic loading has been optimized for maximum production of hydrogen by the microbial community being acclimatized on distillery waste water. The hydrogen producing microbial community was analyzed by culture independent approach using 16S rDNA sequencing and tracking of hydrogen producing genotype (hydA) by quantitative PCR method. Hydrogen is one of the promising alternative energy sources in future and of late microbial hydrogen production from mixed microbial cultures using wastewater is gaining importance. This study targets 2 important points (a) Producing alternative energy source i.e. Hydrogen and (b) Producing hydrogen energy using distillery waste water, hence generating energy from the waste. Therefore, in this study optimization of various operational parameters viz. HRT and organic loading has been carried out for enhancing hydrogen production. The microbial diversity as well as functional diversity (hydA gene) of the SBR (Sequential batch reactor) at different point of operation and optimization has been analyzed to enrich the knowledge about the mixed microbial cultures responsible for hydrogen production. Based on this study, it is possible that design and maintenance of similar bioreactors can be planned for hydrogen production."
1,Materials and method,
2,Reactor design,"2.1 Reactor design The bioreactor was designed based on our earlier work [4]. Wastewater samples were collected regularly from industrial premises and stored until further use at ∼3±1 °C after the initial cultivation pH was adjusted to 7.0 ± 0.1. Anaerobic mixed consortia was acquired as seed for bioreactor from an operating full-scale anaerobic plant treating composite wastewater from industrial and domestic sources. Bench scale reactor with suspended growth configuration was fabricated using ’perplex’ material with leak proof sealing along with proper inlet and outlet arrangements (total volume, 4 L; working volume, 3.6 L).Sequential batch reactor was operated in up-flow mode with a total cycle period of 24 h consisting of 0.25 h of fill phase, 23.00 h of reaction (anaerobic) phase, 0.50 h of settling phase and 0.25 h of decant phase. Various sequence phase operations (feed, reaction, settle and decant) were controlled by pre-programmed timers employing peristaltic pumps. Initially the bioreactor was operated with distillery wastewater at an organic loading (OL) of 3.9 kg COD/m3. After achieving stable performance, the OL was changed (Table 1 ). The system was operated until steady state performance with respect to COD removal efficiency and H2 production was achieved. The reactor was operated with retention time of 24 h at a recirculation rate of 240 ml/h at a temperature 28 ± 2 °C under microaerophilic to anaerobic environment."
3,Analysis,"2.2 Analysis H2 gas generated during the experiments was estimated using a microprocessor based pre-calibrated H2 sensor (ATMI GmBH Inc., Germany). pH, COD (closed refluxing-titration), suspended solids, BOD5 (5 days at 20 °C), TDS and volatile fatty acids (VFA) were determined according to Standard Methods [17]."
4,Isolation of metagenome,"2.3 Isolation of metagenome After the bioreactor was stabilized on distillery wastewater for maximum production of hydrogen, samples were withdrawn for metagenome extraction. Three samples at an interval of a month, at third, fourth and fifth month of operation, were collected from the operating reactor and metagenome was extracted using a protocol reported earlier [18]. For each sampling month, randomly ten independent samples of 100 mg wet weight of biomass were collected. DNA from all 10 replicates was pooled to represent a homogeneous mixture for each month, and stored at −20 °Cuntil required."
5,Construction and screening of 16S rDNA clone Library,"2.4 Construction and screening of 16S rDNA clone Library 100 ng of metagenomic DNA was used as template to amplify 16S rDNA gene using universal 16S rDNA primers 27F forward primer 5′-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3′ and 1492 reverse primer 5′-TACGGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′. Three independent PCR reactions were performed for each month and amplification products were pooled. The 1.5 kb amplicons were gel-purified using the gel extraction kit from Qiagen and cloned into the pDrive vector (Qiagen PCR Cloning Plus Kit, Germany) as per instruction provided by supplier. Transformants were grown overnight in 5 ml LB medium containing 100mg/ml kanamycin and used for plasmid DNA purification using Qiagen Q-20tips (Germany). The 16S rDNA insert was excised by EcoRI digestion and gel-purified. Total 57 clones with 16S rDNA insert from three sampling time points were selected randomly for sequencing. Partial sequencing was carried out from the 5′ end using the 27F primer. The sequence data was analyzed by BLAST to identify the corresponding clones. Sequences were deposited in GenBank and accession numbers [from FJ842899 to FJ842955] were indicated in the supporting data and can be viewed at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/."
6,Cloning hydrogenase gene from hydrogen producing metagenome,"2.5 Cloning hydrogenase gene from hydrogen producing metagenome Hydrogenase gene (hydA) was amplified using PCR conditions and primer set (HGf 5′-AAGAAGCTTTAGAAGATCCTAA-3′)/HGr 5′-GGACAACATGAGGTAAACATTG-3′) and degenerative primers BHf (5′-TCACCWCAACAAATWTTTGG-3′)/BHr (5′-GCWGCTTCCATWACTCCACC-3′) reported earlier [19]. The amplicons were cloned into pDrive cloning vector (Qiagen PCR Cloning Plus Kit, Germany) as described earlier. Cloning, screening and sequencing of clones for hydrogenase gene was carried out in similar manner as described above for 16S rDNA clones. Eight clones (with hydA gene insert) from each month were randomly selected for sequencing. Sequences of hydrogenase gene clones were submitted in GenBank and accession numbers [from GU253925 to GU253931, GU253936 of 4th month and GU253939 to GU253946 of 5th month] are indicated in the supporting data and can be viewed at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/."
7,PCR and quantitative/real time PCR analysis,"2.6 PCR and quantitative/real time PCR analysis Quantification of hydrogenase gene from the metagenome was performed by Real-time PCR assay using an iCycler IQ System (BioRad, USA). PCR reactions were set up using 100 ng of extracted metagenomic DNA as template, 1X iQ SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad, USA), and hydA primers. Regular PCR was also done using the same conditions without SYBR Green."
8,Results,
9,Biohydrogen production,"3.1 Biohydrogen production Bench-scale anaerobic reactor was operated continuously for five months under neutral pH, microaerophilic environment by varying substrate/organic loading (OL) condition and hydraulic retention time (HRT) to arrive at optimum hydrogen producing condition as depicted in Table 1. The substrate loading was changed once the system showed stable performance with respect to both H2 production and substrate degradation. Initially the reactor was fed with distillery wastewater at organic loading (OL) of 3.9 kg COD/m3 and operated at hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3 days. During this phase of operation, the system showed volumetric hydrogen production (VHP) of 0.09 mol H2/m3-day at stabilized conditions. Subsequently, OL was increased to 9.8 kg COD/m3 and operated initially at HRT of 3 days during which the system yielded lower H2 production. After operating for three cycles, the HRT was increased to 5 days and the reactor performance was studied by keeping OL undisturbed. During stabilized phase of operation at this condition, the system showed enhanced H2 production (0.14 mol H2/m3-day). Subsequently, the system was operated by almost doubling OL (24.5 kg COD/m3) and HRT (10 days), wherein H2 production also doubled. With time, H2 production showed consistent improvement and stabilized at VHP of 0.32 mol H2/m3-day. Further, the system was operated at higher HRT (15 days) by keeping OL constant to evaluate role of HRT on the system performance. Even though the system showed higher H2 production, volumetric production showed decreasing trend with increasing the HRT at same substrate loading condition. This might be attributed to the activity of methanogenic bacteria persisting in the system where the produced H2 get used in the formation of CH4 in the process of consuming soluble acid intermediates, [volatile fatty acids (VFA)] generated from the acidogenic process during the longer retention time. Irrespective of the retention time, the system showed marked improvement in H2 production with subsequent increase in substrate loading and retention time. substrate loading conditions and HRT also showed marked influence on the substrate degradation rate (SDR). At 3.9 kg COD/m3-day, the system showed COD removal efficiency (ξCOD) of 37.18% with SDR of 0.44 kg CODR/m3-day. With increase in substrate loading to 9.8 kg COD/m3, substrate degradation also increased significantly (44.29%; 0.781 kg CODR/m3-day). However, at applied higher substrate load of 24.5 kg COD/m3 (at 10 days HRT), the substrate degradation decreased (27.35%; 0.61 kg CODR/m3-day) and approached maximum stabilized performance after 40 days of operation (32.65%; 0.72 kg CODR/m3-day). Longer period of adaptation observed under these loading conditions may be attributed to system inhibition due to shift to higher carbon load. The system when operated at higher HRT (15 days) showed higher degradation efficiency (35.92%; 0.53 kg CODR/m3-day) compared to lower HRT studies in spite of suppressed H2 production. The higher degradation efficiency observed at higher HRT might be attributed to longer retention of the substrate in the bioreactor, which is the key for activation of methanogenic bacteria facilitating additional substrate degradation. This is in concurrence with the lower VFA concentration observed at higher HRT when compared to lower HRT (10 days). Formation of soluble metabolites (VFA) in dark-fermentation process is crucial in defining efficacy of H2 metabolic pathway. During dark-fermentation, the generation of VFA was in good agreement with substrate loading and HRT. Higher substrate load generated higher VFA concentration. While increasing HRT by keeping carbon load constant resulted in low VFA concentration at the end of cycle period. This phenomenon observed may be due to its consumption by methanogenic bacteria in the formation of methane utilizing H2. VFA and pH are integral expressions of acid-base conditions of anaerobic microenvironment, which provide information pertaining to the balance between two important microbial groups (acidogenic and methanogenic) within the system. Production of acids gradually reduces buffering capacity of the system, which in turn, resulted in a concomitant decline in the system pH due to accumulation of organic acids leading to process inhibition [12].The shift of pH was observed towards basic condition in most of the cases studied due to neutral operation. The system retained more or less neutral condition during system operation in spite of VFA generation, may be because of good system buffering capacity."
10,Bacterial community composition dynamics at different time points,"3.2 Bacterial community composition dynamics at different time points This study was directed towards analysis of microbial community, its function, and relation to production of hydrogen under different bioreactor process parameters. Microbial community analysis is widely studied by targeting 16S rDNA [20]. After two months of functionally stable condition for bioreactor the total DNA (metagenome) at 3rd, 4th, and 5th month was extracted. 16S rDNA was PCR amplified and cloned. Total 57 clones i.e. 18 from 3rd month, 19 from 4th month and 20 from 5th month were selected based on EcoRI digestion and sequenced. The third month sample was dominated by the presence of Delftia sp., an aerobic genera, indicating that at this time point anaerobic or microaerophilic conditions were yet to be achieved in the bioreactor. The fourth and fifth month samples were dominated by the anaerobe, Anaerofilum sp. Table 1 demonstrates the increase in hydrogen production with the shift in microbial community from aerobic to anaerobic/microaerophilic. Phylogenetic trees can be viewed in the supporting data, (Figure S1). Sequence analysis of 16S rDNA clones of third month sample demonstrated two clusters, C3-I and C3–II (Figure S1a). C3-I cluster represents 83.3% of the total clones and showed high similarity with Delftia sp. (accession no. EF421406) while the remainder of clones (16.7%) formed cluster C3–II showed high similarity with Sphingomonas sp. ATCC 53159 (accession no. AF503283). All the clones isolated at this time grouped with β-proteobacteria (C3–I) and α-proteobacteria (C3–II). Metagenome from the fourth month of operation, when the bioreactor was producing 1.60 molH2/Kg COD, showed 16S rDNA sequences distributed in three clusters viz. C4-I, C4–II and C4–III (Figure S1b). 85% of the total clones were identified as Anaerofilum sp. and are observed to cluster with the genus Ruminococcus. Both genera belong to the Lachnospiraceae family from the phylum Firmicutes. The second and third cluster in this sample contains only one clone each, C4–II is represented by ‘uncultured bacterium clone’ and C4–III by ‘uncultured Clostridiaceae bacterium clone’. Uncultured bacterium clone [FJ842931] showed 100% similarity with Delftia sp. and Uncultured Clostridiaceae bacterium clone [FJ842932] was classified as Ruminicoccaceae by RDP classifier available at http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/classifier/classifier.jsp but probably due to short sequence length would not group with Delftia acidovorans strain EEZ23 and Ruminococcus clade respectively. In the fifth month of operation, the HRT was increased from 10 days to 15 days. The microbial community profile did not change suggesting stability, but a drop in specific hydrogen production rate was observed. Figure S1c demonstrates the bacteria community profile at this time point. It can be seen that the community is dominantly represented by Anaerofilum sp. Two clusters C5-I and C5–II are observed. Despite being identified as Anaerofilum sp., C5–II did not align with other clones. This could possibly be due to short sequence length as compared to others."
11,Quantification and analysis of hydrogenase (hydA) gene,"3.3 Quantification and analysis of hydrogenase (hydA) gene hydA codes for the hydrogenase gene, responsible for the production of hydrogen. The study also demonstrated the detection of hydA genotype in all the three extracted metagenomes. Fig. 1 shows the amplification pattern of hydA genotype. Samples analyzed from the metagenome of the third month of operation, show very faint hydA product. Since there was significant increase in hydrogen production in the 4th and 5th month quantitative PCR was carried out to assess the increase in copy number of hydA genotype. The figure demonstrates 5 fold increase in hydrogen production genotype in the fourth and fifth month of operation. The hydA genotype was also cloned in the fourth and fifth month of reactor operation and random clones were sequenced. BLAST analysis of sequence data demonstrated homology with the reported Fe hydrogenase gene. Two phylogenetic trees were constructed with hydA gene clones isolated at 4th and 5th months of hydrogen production. Reported Ni, Fe hydrogenase gene sequences were downloaded from GenBank and used in tree construction. A metal free hydrogenase was used as out-group. Fig. 2 a and b demonstrate the clustering of hydA clones. All clones generated from the metagenome at two different time points cluster with Fe dependent hydrogenase, which were reported for hydrogen production."
12,Discussion,"The search for raw material to produce new-generation bioenergy is a priority area of research to support any economy [21]. Distilleries producing molasses spent wash could be used to generate biogas. India is the second largest producer of alcohol in Asia using molasses as raw material [22] and presently 295 distilleries are operating across the country, which produces about 3198 million liters of ethanol per annum [23] where India generates approximately 10–15 L of molasses spent wash (MSW) per liter of alcohol produced [24]. Mostly, the wastewater generated by these industries gets partially utilized for biomethanation. Several studies with mixed cultures, co-cultures, sludge compost [25–28] and pure cultures [29–36] have been reported for microbial hydrogen production. Patel et al. [36], reported a 2–2.5 fold enhancement in hydrogen production using mixed cultures immobilized on ligno-cellulosic bio-wastes. In addition, optimization of process parameters led to reduced incubation period from 4 days in batch culture to 2 days in daily fed conditions. This study demonstrates that by adjusting the process parameters, optimum yield of hydrogen could be achieved by mixed microbial community that has been acclimatized to distillery wastewater. At the initial stage when the bioreactor was running under microaerophilic condition i.e up to 3rd month of acclimatization, it was dominated by aerobic population affiliated with uncultured Delftia sp. clones and uncultured Sphingomonas sp. clones. At the 3rd month of operation, Delftia sp. (a hydrogen oxidizing bacterium) dominated in the microbial community of the reactor resulting in low hydrogen production. Microbial community structure completely changed or shifted to anaerobic population at 4th and 5th month of operation. 85% of the microbial community in the fourth month of operation was represented by Anaerofilum sp., while 10% of the population constituted Clostridiaceae bacterium clones and 5% by uncultured bacterium. At the 5th month, the microbial population dynamics was stabilized with 100% uncultured Anaerofilum sp. clones. This difference in community structure is undoubtedly reflected in sequential change of hydrogen yield from 9.91 mmol at 3rd month to13.64 mmol at 5th month. The microbial diversity of any biological reactor is an important issue in terms of qualitative and quantitative assessment of efficiency of a bioreactor. Microbes produce hydrogen using the enzyme hydrogenase, that catalyses either the production or uptake of hydrogen. Presence of metal cofactor at the active site categories them into three groups: (a)- Iron containing hydrogenases, [Fe] (b)- Nickel, Iron and selenium (in some) hydrogenases, [NiFe] or [NiFeSe] (c)- Metal free [37]. [NiFe] hydrogenases are widely distributed class of hydrogenases that consume hydrogen while Fe hydrogenases, produce hydrogen and have been reported in anaerobes and some green algae [38–40]. Since, Fe hydogenases are responsible for hydrogen production they can be used as biomarker for detection of hydrogen producing bacteria. Hydrogenases are coded by the gene hyd; Fe hydrogenases have two subunits hydA (large) and hydB (small) [41,42]. Metal free hydrogenases do not produce hydrogen and are reported in some methanogens [37]. With the available microbial capacities, the microbial hydrogen production has not yet developed as an economically viable option. There are various levels in process development, where it demands further investigations including improvement in hydrogen production by metabolic engineering [43,44]. The key factor in economics of hydrogen production lies in selection of raw material followed by process option. The anaerobic option of hydrogen production depends on the available microbial biochemistry which has mostly been explored in Clostridium spp. Clostridium is reported as a major component of microbial community in activated sludge responsible for hydrogen production [19,47]. It belongs to Firmicute phylum and has been reported in hydrogen production using various substrates like glucose [47], sucrose [45], xylose [46], starch [47], lactose [48] and sweet potato resides [49]. Clostridium sporosphaeroides F52, C. tyrobutyricum F4, C. pasteurianum F40, have been used as co-cultures to enhance hydrogen production [50,51]. In the present studies, molasses spent wash generated from distilleries has been used as raw material. With adjustment in HRT and organic loading, during process optimization, it has been observed in the present studies that the microbial population became anaerobic at 4th and 5th months of operation thus providing suitable conditions for anaerobic hydrogen production. This data was further supported by quantitative amplification of hydA gene for microbial community in these months. The hydrogenase reported in the study is iron dependent, was also been reported in acidophilic ethanol co-producing system [41] and saline microbial mats [42].The hydA gene level in C. paraputrificum M-21 has been reported to have direct correlation with hydrogen production [52]. Two species of Anaerofilum viz. Anaerofilum pentosovorans gen. nov., sp. nov., and Anaerofilum agile sp. nov isolated from anaerobic bioreactor, are acidogenic bacteria, use glucose to form acetate, formate, lactate, ethanol, and carbon dioxide but are not known to produce hydrogen [53]. They are strictly anaerobic, non spore producer, rod shaped member of Firmicutes group. Anaerofilum reported in this study formed a separate clade that arose from Ruminococcus node; a known hydrogen producer [21]. Also the anaerobic firmicutes are known for production of various organic acids (C3, C4 acids) such as propionic acid, butyric acid, and their derivatives [54]."
13,Conclusion,"With the consideration of ethanol as future biofuel, the molasses spent wash from distillery will emerge as raw material for hydrogen production, that will affects positively the process economics. The study proposes that the process parameters play an important role in eliminating the hydrogen oxidizing community and enriches with the Fe hydrogenase gene pool. The study identifies Anaerofilum as a candidate bacterium for anaerobic hydrogen production. It shows that with the adjustment in process parameter, the metabolic flux in hydrogen production has been supported by regular generation of organic acids, which could provide under reductive metabolism state the flow of proton to generate the hydrogen. Study also shows that there is still an accumulation of volatile fatty acids suggesting that there is further need for process optimization so that microbial metabolism in such systems can be engineered in desired way."
