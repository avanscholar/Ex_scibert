0,Introduction,"Increasing concerns on limited oil supplies, rising crude oil prices and global climate change have spurred the research for alternative fuels [1,2]. The annually alternative fuels production will increase averagely by 5% for the period 2007–2035 according to International Energy Outlook 2010 [3]. Therefore, investigation of synthetic fuels technologies using alternative energy sources such as coal, natural gas or biomass has become increasingly important in recent years [4,5]. Higher alcohols obtained from renewable biomass such as cellulose, lignin and lignocellulose have received considerable interest to use in automobiles [6,7]. In addition, another potential application of higher alcohols is that they may be considered as the feedstock for the synthesis of variety of chemicals and fuels. Higher alcohols synthesis (HAS) from carbon monoxide hydrogenation has drawn much attention due to its environmental friendliness and easily accessible raw materials [8–10]. Several catalytic systems for HAS, including the MoS2-based catalysts, modified methanol synthesis catalysts and modified Fischer–Tropsch catalysts have been developed [11–15]. Among those catalyst systems for higher alcohols synthesis, some problems exist commonly, including low activity and total alcohol selectivity, poor stability and rigorous reaction conditions [16]. Due to the strong ability to promote carbon chain growth for the Fischer–Tropsch elements, copper-modified Fischer–Tropsch catalysts have been extensively studied recently [17,18]. Compared to the Cu–Co based catalyst, the use of iron–copper catalyst is more attractive for higher alcohols synthesis due to its higher water–gas shift activity, lower cost, and favorable engineering characteristics [19,20]. Sibilia et al. [21] investigated the performances of FeCuZnO catalyst, and found that the addition of iron in the catalyst promoted the selectivity of C 2 + alcohols. The results of Zhao et al. [22] showed that incorporation of iron in the CuMnZrO2 catalyst increased the catalytic activity of HAS and the selectivity of higher alcohols. Xu et al. [23,24] suggested that the introduction of Fe into CuMnZrO2 catalyst strengthened the interaction between copper and iron, and promoted the formation of higher alcohols and hydrocarbons. Although numerous studies have been performed to investigate the Fe–Cu-based catalysts, impact of iron promoter on the structures and performances of the copper-based catalysts for higher alcohols synthesis still remains equivocal. Consequently, in this paper we mainly study effects of iron promoter on the microstructures and performances of the CuMnZnO catalyst for higher alcohols synthesis from syngas. Because of the complexity of metal oxide-support interaction, several techniques, including N2 physical adsorption, temperature-programmed reduction of hydrogen (H2-TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used together to characterize the catalyst samples."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The Fe-modified CuMnZnO catalysts were prepared by a conventional co-precipitation method. Typically, a solution containing Fe(NO3)3, Cu(NO3)2, Mn(NO3)2 and Zn(NO3)2 in the required ratio was added to a continuously stirred tanker together with a sodium carbonate solution. The precipitation temperature and pH value were maintained at 80±1°C and 8±0.1, respectively. After aging for 2h, the precipitate was filtered, washed completely with de-ionized water, and dried in air at 120°C for 12h, and then calcined at 450°C for 3h. The compositions of four catalysts were as follows: Fe: Cu: Mn: Zn=(0, 0.15, 030, 045):1:1:1 (molar ratio), which are labeled as CuMnZnO, Fe0.15CuMnZnO, Fe0.30CuMnZnO, and Fe0.45CuMn2.0ZnO, respectively."
3,Catalyst characterizations,"2.2 Catalyst characterizations BET surface area, pore volume and average pore diameter of the catalysts were measured by N2 physisorption at 77K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 instruments. The samples were degassed under vacuum at 393K for 6h prior to measurement. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the catalyst samples were measured using a D/max-RA X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) with CuKα radiation (λ =0.154nm) operated at 40kV and 100mA. Temperature program reduction of hydrogen was carried out in a U-tube quartz reactor with a hydrogen–argon mixture (containing 5vol.% of hydrogen) as the reductive gas. The samples (50mg) were flushed with an argon flow of 50ml/min at 120°C to remove water, and then reduced in a flow of reductive gas at a rate of 10°C/min with a programmable temperature controller. Hydrogen consumption was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The effluent gas was passed through a cold trap placed before TCD in order to remove water from the exit stream of the reactor."
4,Catalyst pretreatment and testing,"2.3 Catalyst pretreatment and testing The higher alcohols synthesis tests were conducted in a fixed-bed, stainless flow microreactor. All catalysts were reduced for 12h in pure hydrogen at 300°C and atmospheric pressure. A steady gas flow rate of 50ml/min was maintained through the whole activation process. After on-line activation described above and cooling to 180°C, syngas was introduced into reactor, followed by a rise of reaction temperature with a rate of 2°C/min. All synthesis reaction was employed at the conditions of 260°C, 4.0MPa, 6000h−1 and the H2/CO of 2.0. Both gaseous and liquid products were analyzed off-line by gas chromatographs. H2, CO, CH4 and CO2 were determined by thermal conductivity detector (TCD) with a TDX-101 column. The water and methanol in liquids were also detected by TCD with a GDX-401 column. The alcohols and hydrocarbons were analyzed by flame ionization detector (FID) with a Porapack-Q column."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Textural properties of the catalysts,"3.1 Textural properties of the catalysts The textural properties of the fresh catalyst samples are listed in Table 1 . Incorporation of iron promoter changes obviously the textural properties of the CuMnZnO catalyst. The BET surface area and the average pore size of the CuMnZnO catalyst are 55m2/g and 9.89nm, respectively. Adding iron in the catalyst resulted in the increase in BET surface area and the decrease in average pore size. The BET surface area increased from 60m2/g to 67m2/g while the average pore size decreased from 9.61nm to 6.84nm as the Fe/Cu ratio increases from 0.15 to 0.45 in the iron-modified CuMnZnO catalysts. All of these results indicate that the addition of iron facilitates the dispersion of catalyst particles and increases the BET surface area, which may be caused by the easy formation of Fe3− x Mn x O4 in the catalyst, promoting the dispersion of catalyst particles [25]."
7,Phase structures of the fresh catalysts,"3.2 Phase structures of the fresh catalysts The XRD patterns of the fresh catalysts are showed in Fig. 1 . From Fig. 1 it can be found that the XRD patterns of the CuMnZnO catalyst show the mainly diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 35.5°, 38.8°, 48.7°, 54.1° and 36.2°, 43.6°, 57.7°, 63.1°, which are the characteristic diffraction peaks of CuO and CuMn2O4, respectively, indicating that the copper may be combined with the manganese to form the Cu–Mn solid solution. In addition, the detectable phase of ZnO was observed in the catalyst, which has characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 34.4°, 36.5° and 56.7°. When iron promoter is added into the CuMnZnO catalyst, a new phase of FeMn2O4 was observed in the XRD patterns, which has the diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 29.5°, 35.0° and 42.5°, except for the intrinsic diffraction peaks. This implies that the addition of iron facilitates the formation of Fe–Mn solid solution. With the gradual increase in iron concentration the intensity of CuO diffraction peaks presented a slowly increasing trend, while that of CuMn2O4 decreased gradually, indicating that the CuO phase may be separated from the Cu–Mn solid solution with the addition of iron promoter in the catalyst. It is possible that the iron added is easily combined with the manganese to form the Fe–Mn solid solution, reducing the interaction between the copper and manganese species. Therefore, increasing iron concentration facilitates the separation of CuO from the Cu–Mn solid solution, increasing the amount of CuO. Additionally, it is also found that the intensity of all the diffraction peaks presented a slowly decreasing trend with the gradual addition of iron promoter, indicating that incorporation of iron in the catalyst facilitates the dispersion of catalyst particles, which is consistent with the BET results."
8,Temperature program reduction of the catalysts,"3.3 Temperature program reduction of the catalysts The H2-TPR curves of the catalysts are showed in Fig. 2 . Two peaks of H2 consumption were observed at 230 and 280°C for the CuMnZnO catalyst, corresponding to the reduction of highly dispersed CuO [26] and the reduction of Cu–Mn solid solution, respectively. With the gradual addition of iron the peak intensity of CuO reduction increased slightly, while that of Cu–Mn solid solution reduction presented an decreasing trend, which indicates that incorporation of iron promoter facilitates the formation of dispersed CuO and reduces the amount of Cu–Mn solid solution, further promoting the reduction of dispersed CuO. This is consistent with the results of XRD mentioned above. Furthermore, accompanied with the gradual increase of iron concentration both the reduction temperature of CuMn2O4 and FeMn2O4 solid solution shifted slowly towards the lower temperature, which may be attributed to the enhancement of H2 chemisorption on the catalyst with increasing amount of dispersed CuO, promoting the reduction of Cu–Mn and Fe–Mn oxides [27]. In addition, a broad peak appeared at 500–700°C is corresponding to the reduction of magnetite [28]. The peak intensity of magnetite reduction increased continually with the gradual increase in iron concentration, implying that increasing iron concentration in the catalyst facilitates the formation of iron oxides."
9,Phase structures of the reduced and used catalysts,"3.4 Phase structures of the reduced and used catalysts Fig. 3 displays the XRD patterns of the reduced catalysts. For the reduced CuMnZnO catalyst a new phase of Cu was observed in the catalyst, which has characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 43.4° and 50.4°, except for the diffraction peaks of CuO and CuMn2O4. As the iron promoter is added into the catalyst, the diffraction peak intensity of Cu increased, whereas that of CuO and CuMn2O4 decreased, indicating that incorporation of iron promotes the reduction of both the CuO and CuMn2O4 structures in hydrogen atmosphere. This further validates the easy combination of iron and manganese, which reduces the interaction between CuO and Mn2O3, facilitating the separation of CuO from the Cu–Mn solid solution and promoting the further reduction of dispersed CuO. When the Fe/Cu molar ratio increases to 0.45, the intensity of all the diffraction peaks decreased, which could be attributed to the addition of more iron in the catalyst, causing the well dispersion of the catalyst particles. After reaction the phase structures of all the catalysts take place obviously changes. From the Fig. 4 it can be found that the intense diffraction peaks were presented for all of the phase structures in the used catalysts, suggesting that the catalyst particles undergo the agglomeration with time on stream during reaction. In addition, for the used iron-modified CuMnZnO catalysts the new diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 37.7° and 45.7° were observed in the XRD patterns, which are attributed to iron carbides. With the increase in iron concentration the peak intensity of both the metallic copper and iron carbides presented a decreasing trend, implying that both the metallic copper and iron carbides are well dispersed in higher iron concentration during reaction."
10,HAS performances,"3.5 HAS performances Higher alcohols synthesis performances of the iron-modified CuMnZnO catalysts were measured at 260°C, 4.0MPa, 6000h−1 and H2/CO=2 (see Table 2 ). From Table 2, it can be seen that the CuMnZnO catalyst produced 94.5% of alcohols (mainly comprised of methanol), suggesting that the copper provides the active sites for methanol synthesis. Incorporation of iron promotes obviously the catalytic activity of CO hydrogenation and the formation of hydrocarbons products. When the Fe/Cu ratio increases from 0.15 to 0.45, the catalytic activity and the space time yield (STY) of hydrocarbons increased from 21% and 0.07g/mlh to 55% and 0.46g/mlh, respectively. However, the selectivity and STY of alcohols presented a decreasing trend with the gradual increase in iron concentration. All of these results indicate that adding iron promotes the catalytic activity of CO hydrogenation and increasing the selectivity of hydrocarbons. Numerous studies have been performed to investigate the performances for higher alcohols synthesis over the Fe–Cu-based catalysts, whereas the catalytic activity and the selectivity for alcohols are still understood unclearly [19,20]. The results of Sibilia et al. [21] indicated that incorporation of iron in the Cu/ZnO catalyst promoted obviously the formation of hydrocarbons. Zhao et al. [22] reported that the addition of iron in the CuMnZrO2 catalyst increased the catalytic activity and the selectivity of higher alcohols. However, the results of Xu et al. [23] showed that the catalytic activity of CO hydrogenation was suppressed for the iron-modified CuMnZrO2 catalyst. In the presented study, adding iron in the CuMnZnO catalyst promotes the dispersion of catalyst particles and increases the amounts of dispersed copper and iron carbides species, which may provide the more active sites for higher alcohols and hydrocarbons synthesis, increasing the catalytic activity for CO hydrogenation. Especially, the iron element has been proven to promote the formation of hydrocarbons. Therefore, the increase of iron concentration in the catalyst leads to the increase in the selectivity and STY of hydrocarbons. The product distribution of alcohols and hydrocarbons is showed in Fig. 5 . From Fig. 5a it can be seen that the product distribution of CuMnZnO catalyst is mainly composed of methanol (93.5%). With the addition of iron promoter in the catalyst the product distribution shifted gradually towards higher alcohols. As the Fe/Cu ratio increases from 0.15 to 0.45, the C 2 + OH /C1OH ratio (shown in Table 2) increased from 1.0 to 3.09. In addition, it can be found from Fig. 5b that the product distribution of hydrocarbons shifted towards heavier molecular weight hydrocarbons with increasing iron concentration. All of these results indicate that adding iron facilitates the formation of C 2 + OH and hydrocarbons. Pijolat and Perrichon [29] studied higher alcohols synthesis of the Fe/Al2O3 catalyst and found that the iron-based catalyst could catalyze syngas to higher alcohols. Xu et al. [23] reported that the addition of iron increased the selectivity to C 2 + OH and hydrocarbons, and decreased the selectivity to methanol. The results in the present study indicate that incorporation of iron facilitates the separation of CuO from the Cu–Mn solid solution and increases the amount of dispersed CuO, promoting the reduction of the catalyst. Furthermore, both the copper and iron carbides species are well dispersed in higher iron concentration during reaction. It is known that the copper has the function of methanol synthesis and the iron element plays an important role in promoting the chain growth. The well dispersion of copper and iron carbides species could strengthen the interaction between copper and iron and promote the chain growth to form higher alcohols. Therefore, the formation of more dispersed Cu and iron carbides with increasing iron concentration provides probably the more active sites for CO hydrogenation, promoting the formation of higher alcohols and hydrocarbons."
11,Conclusions,"Incorporation of iron promoter in the CuMnZnO catalyst has obvious influence on the microstructures and higher alcohols synthesis performances. The addition of iron increased the BET surface area and facilitated the dispersion of catalyst particles. Increasing iron concentration resulted in the easy formation of Fe–Mn solid solution and decreased the interaction between copper and manganese, facilitating the separation of CuO from the Cu–Mn solid solution and promoting the reduction of the catalyst. Both the copper and iron carbides were well dispersed in higher iron concentration during reaction. The catalytic activity of CO hydrogenation and selectivity to C 2 + OH and hydrocarbons presented an increasing trend with the gradual increase in iron concentration, which may be attributed to the enhancement between the dispersed copper and iron carbides."
