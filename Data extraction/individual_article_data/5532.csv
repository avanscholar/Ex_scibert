0,Introduction,"In recent years, with the speeding up of the upgrading of electronic information products, enormous amounts of waste electric and electronic equipment (WEEE) have been generated. Currently, it is estimated that the amount of WEEE production is nearly 45 million tons yearly worldwide, and the annual growth rate is 7–10% [1]. In general, WEEE contains a lot of recyclable resources and poisonous/harmful materials. Therefore, enormous WEEE waste not only is regarded as the “urban mines” with rich resources, but also can bring huge environmental risks. In WEEE, waste printed circuit boards (PCBs) are the most important parts. Hence, the treatment/recycling of waste PCBs with safe technologies have become the research focus of WEEE and attract the most attention of researchers around the world [2]. Waste PCBs is a complex mixture, including metal copper foil, tin-lead solder, precious metals, brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and resin materials. Waste PCBs has a high metal content. Therefore, the recovery of metals from waste PCBs always is the focus of researchers [3,4]. On the other hand, resin materials contained in waste PCBs are always combined with BFRs together, and are intermingled compactly with metals or other materials embedded inside [5]. Therefore the separation and recycling of the polymers in waste PCBs is very difficult [6]. At present, chemical recycling is considered to be a promising recycling technology of polymers [7,8]. Chemical recycling is realized by obtaining monomers or some valuable chemical products from waste polymers using chemical reaction. Pyrolysis is a typical chemical recycling method, and is widely used in the recycling of polymers from waste PCBs [9–12]. Pyrolysis is a heating process without oxygen, and polymers is decomposed to low molecular products including liquids and gases, which can be reused as fuel or chemical feedstock. However, pyrolysis process is easy to generate brominated dioxins and other toxic brominated organic compounds [10]. Therefore some researchers further applied vacuum pyrolysis process or added catalyst to restrain the generation of toxic organic bromine compounds [11,12]. Recently, supercritical fluid (SCF) technology has been successfully applied as a simpler and environmental friendly method for the decomposition of various polymer materials [13–15]. Wang et al. [16] found that supercritical organic solvent (SCOS) could be used as an effective medium for the debromination of waste plastic containing BFRs in computer housing, in which the BFRs was in additive type. In addition, the erosion of SCOS reaction system on the reaction kettle is much lower than supercritical water (SCW) system [17]. Hence, SCOS system has a good application prospect for the treatment of computer housing. However, SCOS system was less effective for BFRs in waste PCBs, since most of BFRs such as TBBPA in PCBs mainly were used as a reactive type which is covalently bound to the polymer [18]. In consideration of the fact that SCW has a higher temperature/pressure and can provide higher energy and efficiently to destroy brominated functional groups in waste PCBs, Xing and Zhang [19] applied SCW to treat reactive type BFRs in waste PCBs. However, there are still some problems as follows: (1) Halfway debromination at low temperature. At low temperature condition such as subcritical water, there was still a certain content of brominated phenol in oil product and the quality of oil products decreased greatly [19]; (2) Low value-added oil products. The main oil products were phenol and its derivatives [19,20]. In this study, we built a critical water-alcohol composite system for decomposition and debromination of waste PCBs. In this composite system, alcohol was introduced into the critical water to decrease critical temperature/pressure and weaken the corrosion of pure critical water system. Critical water-ethanol (CWE) and critical water-methanol (CWM) media are selected as reaction system in this study due to ethanol and methanol are the most common alcohol solvents. The major objective of the present work is to evaluate the effect of critical water-alcohol treatment on the oil product characteristic and the debromination efficiency of waste PCBs. Based on this, a new and high-efficiency approach for improving the additional value of oil products derived from waste PCBs by critical water-alcohol process is proposed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials and chemicals,"2.1 Materials and chemicals Waste PCBs used in this work were obtained from Fujian Hongyuan Environmental Protection Co., Ltd. (China). The waste PCBs were mainly disassembled from discarded personal computer (PC). The electronic components such as capacitors and relays were removed from waste PCBs before use. Then the waste PCBs were cut into small pieces with the size of 2cm×1cm. The major composition of waste PCBs is presented in Table 1 . All chemicals used in this work were purchased from Chemical Reagent Company of Beijing in analytical grade and used without any further treatment."
3,Schematic drawing and CWE/CWM experiments,"2.2 Schematic drawing and CWE/CWM experiments Schematic drawing of CWE/CWM treatment of waste PCBs is shown in Fig. 1 . The CWE/CWM treatment was performed by using a 100-mL high-pressure reactor made of 316 alloy. The reaction conditions are presented in Table 2 . In a typical CWE/CWM treatment, waste PCBs pieces and a certain volume of ethanol/methanol were introduced into the reactor. The CWE/CWM temperatures were controlled at 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, and 450°C, respectively. The solid-to-liquid ratio was controlled at the range from 1:10 to 1:25g/mL, and the V(H2O)-to-V(alcohol) ratio was controlled at 1:1, 2:1, 6:1, and 10:1, respectively. The CWE/CWM treatment time was controlled at 30, 60 and 90min, respectively. The reaction time was defined as follows: The reactor was heated to the selected temperature. Once the reactor had reached the selected temperature, it was held at this temperature for selected reaction time. Hence, the reaction time did not include the time for heating-up to the setup temperature. Furthermore, the time needed to reach the setup temperature has slight differences for different experiments because of the different reaction conditions and the filling rate of the reactor. Generally, 1h was needed for the reactor to reach the setup temperature. A cold water bath was used to quench and terminate the reaction. After that, the gas product was collected and passed through a NaHCO3 solution to capture inorganic bromine compounds. The solid and liquid products were collected and filtrated. The oil phase products were extracted from liquid phase products by using N-hexane."
4,Analysis of products,"2.3 Analysis of products A GC–MS analyzer (Agilent 7890A-5975C, USA) was used to analyze oil products. The bromine contents in original PCBs and solid residue after CWE/CWM treatment were analyzed by oxygen combustion bomb-ion chromatography (IC, DionexICS2000, USA). The bromine content in water phase was determined by ion chromatography. The bromine content in oil phase was calculated by subtracting the bromine content of solid residue and water phase from that of original PCBs."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Oil phase products in low temperature condition of CWE/CWM treatment for waste PCBs,"3.1 Oil phase products in low temperature condition of CWE/CWM treatment for waste PCBs The decomposition behavior and oil products of waste PCBs in critical water have been studied intensively [19,20]. In general, free radical reactions are regarded as the reaction mechanism under critical water condition. In critical water, the most important oil products decomposed from polymers in waste PCBs (mainly epoxy resin) were phenol and phenol alkylation derivatives. Xing and Zhang [19] found that under high temperature condition of critical water (such as supercritical water), the debromination of waste PCBs was complete and no brominated organic compounds could be found in the oil products. However, 2-bromo-phenol were formed under low temperature condition of critical water (such as subcritical water) and existed in the oil products [19], indicating that the debromination was still not complete under low temperature condition of critical water. In this study, ethanol or methanol was added as a co-solvent into critical water to establish critical water-alcohol system. Dissolving performance of the decomposition products of polymers is expected to be improved by adding co-solvent. Furthermore, with the introduction of alcohol, the thermodynamics and kinetics of debromination reaction may be changed, and simultaneously the composition characteristics of oil products also may be changed. Fig. 2 A shows the GC–MS analysis result of the oil product obtained from waste PCBs treated in a typical subcritical water (300°C, 60min). It can be found that phenol has the largest relative peak area. Other main species in oil are alkylated derivatives of phenol such as 2-methyl-phenol, 3-methyl-phenol, and 4-(1-methylethyl)-phenol. Xing and Zhang [19] found that oil products still contained some bromides and in the form of 2-bromo-phenol and its relative peak area was 5.2%. They believed that brominated epoxy resins in waste PCBs began to be incompletely decomposed at 250°C in subcritical water and no bromides could be found in oil when temperature increased to 300°C [19]. However, we found that 2-bromo-phenol still could be found in oil when temperature of critical water was controlled at 300°C and its relative peak area was 3.4% (Fig. 2A). The reason may be the lower pressure (6.1MPa) and the shorter reaction time (60min) in the present study in comparison with that in the experiment of Xing and Zhang (10MPa and 120min) [19]. The reaction conditions used in the experiment of Xing and Zhang (10MPa and 300°C) and the reaction conditions used in this work (6.1MPa and 300°C) were all subcritical conditions. The pressure of subcritical water, which is similar to temperature, can influence the physico-chemical properties of water such as density, viscosity, diffusion coefficient, dielectric constant, and solubility for organic compounds and gas (N2, O2, H2, and other gases) [21]. The subcritical water with higher pressure can enhance the diffusion coefficient of water molecules and the solubility of water for organic compounds (e.g. brominated organic compounds) and gas (e.g. H2 produced in the reaction system) [21]. Therefore, the subcritical water with higher pressure is usually more beneficial to the debromination of 2-bromo-phenol, and inversely the subcritical water with lower pressure produces higher 2-bromo-phenol selectivity. In addition, according to previous studies [22–24], critical fluid such as water is strong enough to destroy the solid wastes such as fly ash or waste PCBs. An increasing number of porous structures can be produced in the solid waste as the reaction pressure rise during the reaction process. As a result, critical water molecules probably can gradually diffuse into the waste PCBs through the porous structure. The porous structure in waste PCBs are supposed to be positive for the diffusing and debromination reaction of waster molecule, H2 molecule, and organic compounds such as 2-bromo-phenol. Hence, the subcritical water with higher pressure could improve the debromination of organic compounds such as 2-bromo-phenol. Fig. 2B and C show the GC–MS analysis results of oil products after the treatment of CWE and CWM at 300°C. The volume ratio of water to alcohol was 2:1. It can be found from Fig. 2B that the composition of oil has little change with the adding of ethanol into critical water, and phenol and its derivatives are still the main products. However, the relative peak area of each compound in oil changed significantly (Fig. 2B). The relative peak area of phenol significantly decreased, while 4-(1-methylethyl)-phenol increased rapidly and became the component with the largest relative peak area (42.5%). In the critical water treatment of waste PCBs, several research groups [19,20] found that phenol and 4-(1-methylethyl)-phenol were the two highest levels of ingredients in oil products. Xing and Zhang [19] found that the increase of critical water temperature could lead to the decrease of phenol and the increase of 4-(1-methylethyl)-phenol [19]. In the present study, it is interesting to find that the introducing of ethanol in critical water can also obtain the similar results. Li and Xu [20] proposed the formation pathway of decomposition products of brominated epoxy resin in critical water. They believed that the decomposition of brominated epoxy resin could generate a series of free radical fragments: bromine radical (Br), phenyl radical (Ph), phenol free radicals (OH-Ph), methyl radical (CH3 ), ethyl radical (CH3CH2 ), isopropyl radical ((CH3)2CH), and 4-(1-methylethyl)-phenol radical ((CH3)2CH-Ph). Then phenol and their derivatives were produced by elimination reactions of free radicals. Because the increase of critical water temperature could enhance the dissolving capacity of organic compounds, leading to the rise of reaction rate between OH-Ph and other free radicals such as (CH3)2CH. As a result, the relative content of phenol in oil phase products significantly decreased and the relative content of 4-(1-methylethyl)-phenol increased rapidly. This point was also confirmed in our subsequent experiment using 400°C and 450°C as the reaction condition of critical water (see Fig. 3 A and B). Similarly, the introducing of co-solvent ethanol into critical water under low temperature of 300°C also could enhance the dissolving capacity of organic species and result in the increase of relative content of 4-(1-methylethyl)-phenol (Fig. 2B). In order to further verify this, ethanol was substituted by methanol in the low temperature system of critical water (300°C). As we expected, similar results were found (Fig. 2C). After the introducing of ethanol (Fig. 2B) and methanol (Fig. 2C) into critical water at low temperature of 300°C, the relative peak area of phenol, 2-bromo-phenol, and other alkylated derivatives of phenol decreased and even disappeared. The most obvious similarity between Fig. 2B and C was that the relative peak area of 4-(1-methylethyl)-phenol increased significantly and became the most important compound in oil products with the largest relative peak area."
7,Debromination in low temperature condition of CWE/CWM treatment for waste PCBs,"3.2 Debromination in low temperature condition of CWE/CWM treatment for waste PCBs Xing and Zhang [19] found that 2-bromo-phenol could be formed in oil at 250°C in critical water. We also detected 2-bromo-phenol in oil at 300°C in critical water (Fig. 2A). However, it is interesting to find that at 300°C in CWE/CWM, no brominated organic compounds are detected in oil (Fig. 2B and C). We inferred that ethanol or methanol not only could act as a co-solvent to enhance the solubility of organic species in critical water, but also might participate in the reactions. Many researchers [25–28] reported that in subcritical water and supercritical water contained ethanol/methanol, steam reforming reaction happened and hydrogen could be generated. The hydrogen production efficiency depends on temperature and catalyst used [25–28]. In general, the steam reforming reaction of alcohol in critical water is endothermic reaction, so high temperature is propitious to promote the reaction. Theoretically, the hydrogen purity of gas produced from CWE or CWM system is 75%. However, there are many other reaction pathways that can occur during reforming process. The reforming reaction equations of CWE and CWM are as follows: (1) C2H5OH+3H2O↔2CO2 +6H2 (2) CH3OH+H2O↔CO2 +3H2 We speculated that in the critical water-alcohol medium constructed in this study, the water-alcohol medium itself participated in the steam reforming and hydrogen-production reactions, and the produced high pressure hydrogen had a high-efficiency reduction ability for the brominated organic compounds existed or formed in the oil products, thus greatly inhibited the production of brominated organic compounds in the oil products. However, the temperature of critical water-alcohol used in this study was lower (200°C–450°C), which was against the hydrogen-production reaction of critical water-alcohol medium [29,30]. Many studies showed that alkali salt [31], metal oxide [32,33], and active metal [25] were able to enhance the production of hydrogen even at subcritical water with lower temperatures. It is interesting to note that waste PCBs contain a large amount of transition metal such as Cu, Cr, and Ni, especially Cu whose content is around 20%. These transition metals might act as catalysts during the water gas shift reaction in CWE/CWM, and facilitated the hydrogen production at lower temperature of critical water-alcohol. To verify our speculation, the composition of gas mixture generated in the CWE/CWM reaction system was determined. The details of the determination are shown as follows. The reaction condition of CWE/CWM was controlled at 400°C, 30min, solid-to-liquid ratio of 1:20g/mL, and V(H2O)/V(alcohol) of 2:1. The gas mixture was collected and successively passed through a condenser and N-hexane to remove the unreacted alcohol, water and other small molecule organic compounds produced from the decomposition of waste PCBs. After that, the gas mixture was analysed by gas chromatography (GC, Beifen-Ruili, SP-3420A). In CWE reaction system, the composition of gas mixture generated was H2 (71.28%), CO (1.96%), and CO2 (26.76%). In CWM reaction system, the composition of gas mixture generated was H2 (74.71%), CO (1.44%), and CO2 (23.85%). According to the analysis results, the concentration of H2 in the gas mixture generated from CWE/CWM system at 400°C could exceed 70%, which could account for the debromination ability of CWE/CWM system for waste PCBs."
8,Oil phase products characteristic and debromination in high temperature condition of CWE/CWM treatment for waste PCBs,"3.3 Oil phase products characteristic and debromination in high temperature condition of CWE/CWM treatment for waste PCBs Several research groups [19,20] found that in critical water treatment for waste PCBs, temperature had little effect on the chemical composition of oil product, and the only change was just the relative amount of different ingredients contained in oil with the increase of temperature. For convenient comparison, we investigated the oil products decomposed from waste PCBs by critical water at 300°C, 400°C, and 450°C, respectively. The results are shown in Figs. 2A, 3A, and B. Phenol had the highest relative peak area at 300°C, while 4-(1-methylethyl)-phenol was almost equivalent to phenol at 400°C. When temperature increased to 450°C, the relative peak area of 4-(1-methylethyl)-phenol was higher than that of phenol and had the highest relative peak area. Therefore, the increase of critical water temperature could lead to conversion of the principal component of oil product from phenol to 4-(1-methylethyl)-phenol. The effect of critical water-alcohol temperature on the oil composition was much more complex and interesting than that of critical water. Fig. 3C and D present the GC–MS analysis results of the oil products decomposed from waste PCBs by CWE at 400°C and 450°C. It can be found that 4-(1-methylethyl)-phenol still had the highest relative peak area. Inversely, the relative peak area of phenol decreased significantly. This result was similar to the oil products obtained by CWE at 300°C. At 400°C of CWE, the compound in oil product with the second-highest relative peak area was 4-(1-methylethyl)-phenetole. This was a new product, which was not reported in previous studies [19,20] about the treatment of waste PCBs in critical water. It also was not detected in the oil products of CWE treatment at 300°C (Fig. 2B). Obviously, 4-(1-methylethyl)-phenetole was the reaction product derived from the hydrogen removal reaction between ethyl radical (CH3CH2 ) and 4-(1-methylethyl)-phenol. Another significant characteristic of oil phase composition is that ethyl substituted or multi-alkyl substituted phenol derivatives have higher relative peak area, such as 2-ethyl-phenol, 2-ethyl-5-methyl-phenol, 2-ethyl-4,5-dimethyl-phenol, and 2,4-dimethyl-phenol. We speculate that this is an important reason for the decrease of relative peak area of phenol. To some extent, this also indicated that in CWE of 400°C, ethyl radical (CH3CH2 ), which was derived from ethanol molecules or the decomposition of epoxy resins, had a higher content and stronger reactivity. We inferred that the content and reactivity of CH3CH2 might be further enhanced with the rise of temperature. Fig. 3D shows the GC–MS analysis result of oil product obtained from CWE of 450°C. It is interesting to see that 4-(1-methylethyl)-phenetole disappears, while the relative peak area of 2-ethyl-phenol reaches up to the second place and is very close to 4-(1-methylethyl)-phenol, which has the highest relative peak area. The results indicated that 400°C was beneficial to the reaction between CH3CH2 and phenolic hydroxyl groups and the generation of ether compounds, while 450°C was beneficial to the reaction between CH3CH2 and carbon of benzene ring and the generation of ethyl substituted or multi-alkyl substituted phenol derivatives. In order to further verify this, CWM system was also investigated at 400°C and 450°C. The GC–MS analysis results of oil products decomposed from waste PCBs by CWM treatment at 400°C and 450°C are shown in Fig. 3E and F. We found that the characteristic regularity in CWM system was much more obvious than that in CWE system. No species of 4-(1-methylethyl)-phenol could be detected in the oil products decomposed from CWM at 400°C and 450°C, which was completely different from CWE system. Under CWM system of 400°C, anisole had the highest relative peak area among oil products. Apparently, anisole was derived from the direct reaction between phenol and methyl radical (CH3 ). The second place of the relative peak area was 1-methoxy-4-(1-methylethyl)-benzene. The results indicated that under CWM system of 400°C, CH3 tended to react with phenol and 4-(1-methylethyl)-phenol to generate the corresponding ether compounds. This regularity is similar to the CWE system of 400°C. The difference is that the reaction path of the generation of ether compounds is the most predominant in CWM system of 400°C. We also observed that a certain amount of benzene derivatives were generated in oil product in CWM of 400°C. The benzene derivatives generated were 4-(1-methylethyl)-methylbenzene and p-xylene, which were in the third and fourth of relative peak area, respectively. This indicated that some CH3 reacted with phenyl radical (Ph) or 4-(1-methylethyl)-phenyl radical ((CH3)2CH-Ph) directly. This kind of compounds was not found in the oil products derived from critical water treatment of waste PCBs in the previous reports [19,20]. When CWM temperature increased to 450°C, the compounds in the top third of relative peak area were 2,6-dimethyl-phenol, 2,3,6-trimethyl-phenol, and p-xylene, respectively. No ethers could be found in oil products, but three-substituted phenol derivatives could be detected, indicating that under CWM system of 450°C, CH3 could not directly react with phenolic hydroxyl groups to produce ethers. However, CH3&903; tended to react with the carbon on benzene ring of phenol to produce multi-substituted phenol derivatives. It should be noted that in the studies of Xing and Xu [19,20], few three-substituted phenol derivatives could be produced in critical water system. Furthermore, in CWM system of 450°C, another reaction pathway was the direct reaction of CH3 and Ph to generate p-xylene. Therefore, we can obtain different oil products we want by controlling the temperature of critical water-alcohol composite medium. In addition to the recovery of phenol and its derivatives from waste PCBs, we can also obtain high levels of ethers and benzene derivatives such as anisole and p-xylene, which are all important chemicals or chemical intermediates with high added-value. Simultaneously, we also found that Br-free oil products could be obtained easily even at low temperature of 300°C by using critical water-alcohol composite medium. It is believed that the additional value of oil products derived from waste PCBs can be greatly improved by this new process."
9,Effect of CWM treatment conditions on the debromination efficiency,"3.4 Effect of CWM treatment conditions on the debromination efficiency Fig. 4 shows the effect of CWM on the debromination efficiency of waste PCBs. The CWE experiments were also carried out. The results are very similar to the CWM system and are not shown here. Debromination efficiency was calculated according to bromine content in waste PCBs before and after CWM treatment. The definition of debromination efficiency is expressed as: (3) Debromination efficiency (%)=(M2-M1) ×100/M2 where M1 is the Br content in treated waste PCBs, M2 the initial Br content in original waste PCBs. The influencing parameters studied including temperature, reaction time, V(H2O)/V(CH3OH) ratio, and solid-to-liquid ratio. It can be found from Fig. 4A that temperature had a significant effect on the debromination efficiency. No obvious debromination at 200°C, the debromination efficiency was only 4.5%. With the increase of temperature, debromination efficiency increased markedly. When temperature increased to 250°C, 300°C, and 350°C, debromination efficiency increased to 68.6%, 89.2%, and 99.9%, respectively. After 350°C, the increase of temperature had little effect on the debromination. Obviously, higher reaction temperature can help provide more energy for the chemical bond cleavage and the formation of free radicals. On the other hand, many studies [34,35] showed that in the critical water-alcohol reforming and hydrogen production system, hydrogen formation is favored at high temperature. More hydrogen in the system was advantageous to the hydrogenation and debromination reduction reaction of brominated organic compounds. This may be one of the important reasons for the increase of debromination efficiency under high temperature condition. Fig. 4B presents the effect of reaction time. When reaction time increased from 30min to 60min, debromination efficiency increased from 95.3% to 99.9%. That is to say, the reaction time of 60min was enough for the debromination of waste PCBs. Solid-liquid ratio also had a great influence on debromination efficiency (Fig. 4D). The decrease of solid-liquid ratio was advantageous to debromination efficiency, and the highest debromination efficiency (99.9%) could be obtained at the solid-liquid ratio of 1:20. Hence, the consumption of organic solution per unit PCBs was 6.67mL alcohol per 1g waste PCBs. A comparison of present study with previous reports on the consumption of organic solution per unit waste PCBs was presented in Table 3 . Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) were used to dissolve brominated epoxy resins contained in waste PCBs [36,37]. Zhang and Zhang [38] applied methanol for the recovery of triphenyl phosphate (TPPO) from waste PCBs by solvothermal process. In fact, these methods [36–38] are dissolution processes for the separation of waste PCBs. However, the treatment by using methanol in reference [39] and the treatment by using CWE/CWM in this work are decomposition processes of waste PCBs. From Table 3, it can be found that the consumption of organic solution per unit waste PCBs in dissolution processes [36–38] is less than that of decomposition process by pure methanol [39]. Also, it can be found from Table 3 that when water is introduced into the decomposition process using organic solvent such as ethanol and methanol (this work), the consumption of organic solution per unit waste PCBs can be reduced in comparison with the decomposition process using pure organic solvent [39]. The effect of V(H2O)/V(CH3OH) ratio on debromination efficiency is very interesting. We investigated four ratios of V(H2O)/V(CH3OH): 1:1, 2:1, 6:1, and 10:1 (Fig. 4C). The debromination efficiency at the V(H2O)/V(CH3OH) ratio of 1:1, 2:1, 6:1, and 10:1 was 97.7%, 99.9%, 99.8%, and 99.6%, respectively. Apparently, the increase of V(H2O)/V(CH3OH) ratio was conducive to debromination and a 99.9% of debromination efficiency could be obtained at the V(H2O)/V(CH3OH) ratio of 2:1. However, debromination efficiency changed slightly and maintained a stable level when further increasing the ratio of V(H2O)/V(CH3OH). The reforming of methanol or ethanol in critical water can produce H2 along with CO, CH4, and CO2 [34,35]. The content of product such as CO, CH4, and CO2 could be changed when the reaction parameters were changed. One of the important influencing parameters is the water-to-alcohol ratio. Several studies [34,35] found that methane formation was favored at a low steam-to-carbon ratio and hydrogen formation was favored at a high water-to-alcohol ratio. So, the generation of methane could be suppressed and the hydrogen production could be promoted with the increase of V(H2O)/V(CH3OH) ratio, thus the hydrogen content in the combination gas increased and hydrogenation/debromination reaction of brominated organic compounds was enhanced."
10,Bromine distribution in the products after CWM treatment,"3.5 Bromine distribution in the products after CWM treatment The bromine distribution was calculated according to the bromine content in solid residue, oil phase, and aqueous phase. Fig. 5 shows the bromine distribution after CWM treatments at different temperature. After each reaction, nitrogen was introduced to drive the gas phase products away from the reactor and NaHCO3 solution was used to capture Br-containing species in the gas. The bromine content in the obtained NaHCO3 solution was detected and it was found that no inorganic bromine existed in the gas phase products in all experiments. HBr could be transferred into aqueous phase during the cool process. So, the content of HBr in aqueous phase also represented the HBr content in the gas phase. At 200°C, the debromination efficiency of waste PCBs was very low and almost all of the bromine was retained in solid residue. The Br content (3.3%) in oil was higher than that in aqueous phase (1.2%), indicating that brominated waste PCBs could not be completely decomposed into inorganic bromine at 200°C. The temperature of 250°C significantly enhanced the debromination efficiency, and most of the removed Br was transferred into aqueous phase. However, a small amount of bromine (1.1%) still existed in oil. When temperature increased to 300°C, 10% of the Br retained in solid residue and approximately 90% of the Br was transferred into aqueous phase, and no Br could be detected in oil. When temperature was further raised (350°C, 400°C, 450°C), almost all of the Br could be decomposed into inorganic bromine and be transferred into aqueous phase. An obvious variation tendency is that most of the Br in waste PCBs was gradually transferred from solid phase into aqueous phase with the increase of temperature, while a small amount into oil phase. When temperature was higher than 300°C, 100% of the Br was transferred into aqueous phase and Br-free oil phase products were obtained. This result was consistent with the GC–MS analysis result of oil products."
11,Conclusions,"The results of this work showed that critical water-alcohol composite medium was an efficient and promising method to recover high value-added chemicals or chemical intermediates from waste PCBs. The temperature of CWE/CWM had a significant effect on the composition of oil products. At low temperature CWE/CWM of 300°C, 4-(1-methylethyl)-phenol was the most important component with the highest relative peak area in oil product. The results indicated that 400°C was beneficial to the reaction between CH3 /CH3CH2 and phenolic hydroxyl groups and the generation of ether compounds, while 450°C was beneficial to the reaction between CH3 /CH3CH2 and carbon of benzene ring and the generation of CH3/CH3CH2 substituted or multi-alkyl substituted benzene/phenol derivatives. In CWE of 400°C, high content 4-(1-methylethyl)-phenol and 4-isopropyl-phenetole could be obtained. In CWE of 450°C, high level of 2-ethyl-phenol could be obtained. In CWM of 400°C, no phenol and its derivatives were generated, and anisole with the highest relative peak area could be generated. In CWM of 450°C, high level of p-xylene and multi-substituted alkylation phenol could be recovered. Therefore, by controlling reaction conditions of CWE/CWM, high level of chemicals/chemical intermediates with high added value can be obtained. It was found that the optimal debromination parameter of CWE/CWM was 350°C, 60min, solid-to-liquid ratio of 1:20g/mL, and V(H2O)/V(CH3OH) ratio of 2:1, respectively. When temperature was higher than 300°C, 100% of the Br was transferred into aqueous phase and Br-free oil phase products could be obtained."
