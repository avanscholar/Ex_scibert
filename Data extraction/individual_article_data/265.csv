0,Introduction,"Very recently, several researchers have proposed an interesting S-scheme charge transfer mechanism in heterojunction materials (Wageh et al., 2021): The charge transfer pathway of S-scheme comes its name from the “step” from low CB (conduction bands) to high CB. S-scheme is composed of a RP (reduction-photocatalyst) and a cross-banded OP (oxidation-photocatalyst) like direct Z-scheme heterojunction, but meaningless charge carriers among photo-generated electrons and holes are removed through recombination. Therefore, only the more powerful charges gather to CB of RP and VB (valence bands) of OP, and extended light absorption, efficient charge separation, and strong redox potential are achieved in this junction complex. However, S-scheme junction materials have not been dealt with much compared to type II or Z-scheme junction materials until now, and the application of charge transfer has been limited to the carbon dioxide conversion mechanism (Xu et al., 2020). Therefore, if it is possible to design a photocatalyst suitable for the target reaction by well understanding the role of charge transfer and co-catalyst in the S-scheme system, it will be possible to provide a more stable and reliable performance in various divisions, compared to the existing systems. In particular, it is necessary to expand the application field to a photocatalytic conversion mechanism that generates hydrogen from water-splitting, which is considered an alternative energy source to prevent global warming (Cheng et al., 2021). The S-scheme junction material has a strong redox ability, which has a thermodynamic advantage in the overall reaction of photocatalytic water decomposition: however, the photocatalytic reaction is influenced not only by thermodynamics but also by kinetics. Therefore, in order to develop an S-scheme photocatalyst with excellent performance in water-splitting, strategies such as appropriate cocatalyst loading, morphology control, and interfacial optimization are used to lower the activation barrier in the photocatalytic reaction, thereby must accelerate the charge carrier separation and diffusion. On the other hand, it has been reported that junction particles exhibiting an S-scheme charge transfer mechanism are most effective when they are heterojunctioned by n-n type (Ghoreishian et al., 2021): For example, gC3N4 and WO3, which are a representative S-scheme heterojunction material, both exhibit n-type semiconductor properties, and CB positions are about −1.25 and −0.34 V, respectively (Fu et al., 2019). However, it is necessary to widen the junction range to confirm its usefulness in various junctions such as p-p or n-p. On the other hand, as a substitute for CdS, several research groups have focused on the development of non-toxic, environmentally friendly, and inexpensive co-catalysts such as ZnS and Bi2S3, and have reported high H2 production in heterogeneous catalytic reactions by using these co-catalysts (Gao et al., 2016; Hisatomi et al., 2015). In addition, sulfur-based photocatalysts with an electron configuration of 3 d6 or higher (such as FexSy, NixSy, and CuxS) have recently been actively researched; these photocatalysts have been joined with other semiconductor particles, and are distinguished by their excellent photoactivity (Chandra et al., 2018; Jia et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2018). However, unlike these metal sulfides, CoxSy as a photocatalyst is sparsely applied to industrial systems, and scant scientific evidence has also been provided for the improved catalytic performance of CoxSy. This is probably because the synthesis of CoxSy with one type of crystal structure is difficult, and the synthesized particles are large and vulnerable to water and acid solutions (Kumar et al., 2017). Cobalt sulfide, with the formula CoxSy, is a black semiconductor material that can support various oxidation states (for example, CoS, CoS2, Co3S4, and Co9S8), is insoluble in water and absorbs visible light; thus, it can be used for heterogeneous photocatalysis. To date, CoxSy mixed with Mo has been used as a catalyst in large-scale hydride sulfurization processes and as an electrocatalyst in redox sulfur batteries (Escobar et al., 2019; Li et al., 2018). However, it has not been widely used as a photocatalyst; specifically, CoxSy has hardly been used as a catalyst for H2 production by photochemical water splitting until the last few years. However, some very recent studies have reported good performance by using CoS and CoS2 as photosensitive co-catalysts. Niu and colleagues produced photocatalytic hydrogen on CoS/TiO2 photocatalysts in an aqueous methanol solution; 20 wt% CoS/TiO2 photocatalyst was used to obtain 5.6 mmol g−1∙h−1 of hydrogen, which was 67 times higher than that of pure TiO2 (Niu et al., 2018). As another example, Chu et al. researched the hydrogen production on CdS/CoSx photocatalysts with a Na2S/Na2SO3 sacrificial agent, arguing that the hydrogen production efficiency reached 168.6 μmol cm−2∙h−1 under simulated sunlight, which was the same as that of CdS/Pt (Chu et al., 2019). Moreover, Liu and colleagues reported the production of 7.12 mmol g−1∙h−1 of hydrogen in the presence of Eosin Y as a sensitizer and triethanolamine (TEOA) as an electronic sacrificial agent by using a CoS/ZnWO4 composite catalyst (Liu et al., 2020). The authors concluded that the bandgap location between the two particles, CoS and ZnWO4, improved the catalytic performance. These results reveal that CoSx shows good hydrogen production performance when used as a photosensitizer or co-catalyst. Note that the three studies used different sacrificial agents for the reaction; In particular, the CoSx photocatalyst showed the most stable and excellent catalytic performance with Na2S/Na2SO3 or TEOA sacrificial agents. TEOA and sulfide sacrificial agents are already known to have higher hydrogen production activity than when methanol or lactic acid sacrificial agents are used because they are more strongly adsorbed on the holes in the VB of the main catalysts (Nagakawa and Nagata, 2021). Additionally, when TEOA was used as a sacrificial agent, the pH of the solution became alkaline, making it difficult for S to escape from the M-S bond of the catalyst. Another reason is that the common ion effect of S ions in the sacrificial agent prevented S ions from escaping from the unstable CoSx. Eventually, as mentioned, the biggest problem is that CoS is difficult to synthesize and has poor structural stability against external environments. However, if the CoS can be easily synthesized, the method can be found to maintain its stability during the reaction, and its catalytic activity can be proven to be excellent, its application will be more diverse than other sulfur-based catalysts. Moreover, although Co is slightly more expensive than other 3d transition metals (for example, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn), it is more environmentally stable than Cd, Ni, or Cu, and much less expensive than 4d transition metals (such as Bi). Therefore, the introduction of CoS as a photocatalyst is highly attractive when considering both economic feasibility and ecological stability. Ultimately, the key to this study is to prove whether the S-scheme charge transfer mechanism was possible in introducing a p-n heterogeneous junction catalyst as a water splitting catalyst. Furthermore, this study aims to stably prepare structurally unstable CoS and to keep the structures stable during catalysis when used as a catalyst. To maintain the structural stability by wrapping the particles with other stable nanoparticles so that S ions do not escape from the framework of CoS during the photoreaction, we synthesize CoS sheets—among various CoxSy—and used a simple hydrothermal method to weave them into a polyhedral cage-like shape. To prevent their dissolution and photo-corrosion during the reactions, TiO2 nanoparticles, which have excellent stability against water or light, encapsulate the CoS micro cages to form a core–shell-type CoS@TiO2 heterojunction catalyst. This structural stability leads to the durability of the catalyst, which will eventually promote hydrogen production from water splitting. Moreover, it is expecting that the synthesized CoS@TiO2 heterojunction catalyst follows the S-scheme charge transfer mechanism and forms a strong redox site due to effective charge separation, which the catalytic performance is greatly improved."
1,Results and discussion,
2,Physicochemical properties of synthesized xCoS@yTiO2 particles,"2.1 Physicochemical properties of synthesized xCoS@yTiO2 particles Fig. 1 a shows the XRD patterns of the TiO2, CoS, and xCoS@yTiO2 particles (The synthesis methods and characterizations of particles are presented in Scheme S1 and supplementary file). The XRD pattern of TiO2 was consistent with the diffraction peaks of anatase in the tetrahedral (I41/amd, JCPDS card No. 00-021-1272) crystal system, and the diffraction planes of (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), and (204) appeared at the 2θ values of 25.28°, 37.80°, 48.05°, 53.89°, 55.06°, and 62.69°, respectively (Shirke et al., 2011). The XRD pattern of CoS was consistent with that of the hexagonal crystal system (P63/mmc, JCPDS card No. 03-065-3418) (Kumar et al., 2019); the peaks at 2θ values of 30.48°, 35.19°, 46.88°, and 54.16° correspond to the (100), (101), (102), and (110) diffraction planes, respectively, and the crystallinity was excellent. Some peaks were almost similar to the peaks of CoS1.097 (JCPDS card No. 00-019-0366, hexagonal, P63/mmc)—specifically, those corresponding to the (204), (220), (306), and (330) diffractive planes (Li et al., 2021). Therefore, the CoS particles obtained in this study contained slightly more S atoms than Co atoms, rather than the Co to S atomic ratio of 1:1. Moreover, because the XRD peaks of CoS2 or Co2S3, which appeared mixed in many studies, were not observed at all, the material produced in this study was concluded to be CoS. Meanwhile, the diffraction peak intensities in the xCoS@yTiO2 junction particles increased or decreased proportionally with the amount of CoS and TiO2. Even after the junction was introduced, no shift in the diffraction peaks was observed, and no new peaks, such as those corresponding to CoSO4 or CoSO3. This result indicated that CoS did not decompose into Co or S during the heterojunction and was stable as produced. Therefore, the XRD results revealed that the heterojunction of CoS and TiO2 particles did not change the crystal structure of CoS or TiO2. The average crystallite size was estimated using Scherrer's equation (Bokuniaeva and Vorokh, 2019), and the average crystallite sizes for pure CoS and TiO2 were determined to be 200 and 13 nm, respectively. To investigate the distortion or defects in the crystal structure during the heterojunction, Raman spectra of TiO2, CoS, and 1CoS@2TiO2 particles were obtained, as shown in Fig. 1b. The Raman peaks corresponding to the A1g, B1g(2), and Eg(2) modes of the TiO2 anatase particles are reported to be located at 150, 200, 400, 510, and 640 cm−1 (Stagi et al., 2015); the results of this study are consistent with those of this report. For the CoS particles, the intensity of the peaks was small; thus, the spectrum was enlarged by 200 times and presented. In general, the Raman peaks of the CoS particles corresponding to the Eg, F2g, and A1g modes appeared at 475, 517, and 676 cm−1, respectively (Ma et al., 2019). In this study, the Eg peak at 475 cm−1 was not observed; however, the Eg peak corresponding to CoS2 was observed at 325 cm−1. From this result, the CoS obtained in this study was determined to be CoS1.5, which contained S with an intermediate content of CoS and CoS2. Notably, in the Raman spectrum of the 1CoS@2TiO2 particle, the CoS peaks were indiscernible and the TiO2 peaks did not shift at all, indicating that the particles suffered no crystal damage during the junction formation. Fig. 1c presents the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy of the three particles. For all three particles, peaks corresponding to the bending mode of the OH group in un-dissociated water molecules at 1430 and 1630 cm−1 were observed (Hafeez et al., 2019). A small peak in particles containing cobalt, CoS and 1CoS@2TiO2, can also be observed at 2200 cm−1 because of molecular CO2 in the atmosphere (Escobar et al., 2020). The peaks at 468 and 800 cm−1 were assigned to the stretching modes of Ti–O or Co–S in the 1CoS@2TiO2 particle. The peak at 458 cm−1 in the CoS particle was assigned to S–S disulfide, indicating that the CoS obtained in this study contained an excess of sulfur (Shiell et al., 2016). However, the large OH stretching mode around 3400 cm−1 in the 1CoS@2TiO2 spectrum provides indirect evidence that 1CoS@2TiO2 is more hydrophilic than TiO2 (Hafeez et al., 2019). The morphologies of the particles were determined using the SEM (a) and TEM (b) images of the synthesized TiO2, CoS, and 1CoS@2TiO2 particles, as shown in Fig. 2 . The SEM images revealed that the TiO2 particles agglomerated to form a dense lump, whereas the entangled CoS particles zigzagged with each other to form a polyhedral basket-shaped cage upon sheet formation. In particular, it seemed that the inner sheets could not escape because of the regular stems wound on the outside. In addition, in the 1CoS@2TiO2 sample, the small TiO2 particles adhered to the polyhedral cage-shaped CoS surface to form like a core–shell shape (explained by the charge difference in Fig. S1). In the TEM image, the TiO2 particles were very small (approximately 10 nm) and they were dispersed and connected with each other. However, the polyhedral CoS cage was large (150–200 nm in width and length). In the TEM photograph of 1CoS@2TiO2 with two junction particles, very small TiO2 spherical particles surrounded the CoS microcage with a width of approximately 100 nm. This result confirmed that the junction particles obtained in this study were a core–shell typed CoS@TiO2 structure, a CoS polyhedral cage surrounded by TiO2 nanoparticles. The interfacial structure between CoS and TiO2 in the 1CoS@2TiO2 heterojunction particle can be obtained from the HRTEM image, as shown in Fig. 3 . The enormous hexagonal particle, CoS, was surrounded by TiO2 nanoparticles with a thickness of approximately 0.2 μm (Fig. 3a). In the lattice fringe images, lattice distances of 0.291, 0.254, and 0.193 nm were assigned to the (100), (101), and (102) facets of hexagonal CoS, respectively (Fig. 3b). The (101), (004), and (200) distinct lattice patterns interlaced with d-spaces of 0.351, 0.237, and 0.188 nm indicate the existence of anatase TiO2. Because the diffraction points of the two particles, CoS and TiO2, formed a perfect circle in the SAED patterns, both of these particles were considered polycrystalline (Fig. 3c) (Ahmed et al., 2020). The components were identified using the TEM-EDS spectrum by dividing the surface and the inside of the junction particle (Fig. 3d). In the hexagonal particles, the CoS peak was larger than the TiO2 peak. However, on the surface surrounding the hexagonal particles, the TiO2 peak is much larger than the CoS peak. This result is evidence that TiO2 surrounds the CoS. HAADF element-mapping analysis was performed on this part (Fig. 3e): The Co component represented in red was visible only in the middle part, and the Ti component represented in green was spread over the entire particle. In particular, the Ti component was more loaded on the edge of the particles. To ascertain the composition ratio of the elements constituting the particles, the EDS spectral patterns were determined, as presented in Fig. S2, and the elemental compositions are summarized in Table 1 . Because only the Ti and O components were observed in the pure TiO2-EDS pattern and only the Co and S components were observed in the CoS EDS pattern, we ascertained that the particles were successfully synthesized. For the xCoS@yTiO2 particles in which the two particles were joined, the peak intensities of Ti and Co increased or decreased proportionally with the addition ratio of the two particles, indicating that they were also synthesized quantitatively. The Ti:O atomic ratio in the TiO2 particles was approximately 1:2, whereas the Co:S atomic ratio in the CoS particles was approximately 1:1. However, in the 1CoS@2TiO2 particles, the Ti:O atomic ratio was 1:2.17, and the Co:S atomic ratio was 1.28:1.0, which indicated that the amount of O increased and the amount of S decreased compared with pure TiO2 and CoS. The Co:Ti atomic ratio was 1:1.44, which is less than twice the difference. The trend was also similar for the other junction particles. In summary, a small excess of S—probably because of the S molecules adsorbed on the surface—existed in pure CoS, whereas S defects existed in the junction particles. To determine the oxidation state of the elements in each particle, we collected XPS spectra, with the results shown in Fig. 4 . Unexpectedly, the results revealed that Co2+ (2p3/2 and 2p1/2 binding energies at 780.3 and 796.2 eV, respectively) and Co3+ (2p3/2 and 2p1/2 binding energies at 778.3 and 793.1 eV, respectively) were present in the pure CoS particles (Han et al., 2018). In the xCoS@yTiO2 heterojunction particles, as the TiO2 content increased, the Co 2p3/2 peaks shifted to lower binding energy, and the Co2+/Co3+ ratio decreased. Yu et al. (2019) reported that the Co 2p3/2 binding energy of Co loaded in TiO2 negatively shifted by 0.7 eV. Also, they revealed that the Co atom on the surface acted as an electron collector and, eventually, the electron density was transferred toward Co. As a result, electrons are transferred from TiO2 to Co through the interface between two particles with different Fermi levels, which improves the hydrogen evolution reaction activity. In this study, CoS is expected to increase the electron density of the conduction bands (CBs) of Co by attracting electrons emitted from TiO2. The two Ti 2p peaks at 464.6 eV and 458.8 eV were attributed to the Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 orbitals of TiO2, respectively (Zhu et al., 2017). In the xCoS@yTiO2 heterojunction particles, in contrast to Co, the Ti 2p3/2 binding energy shifted toward a more oxidized state—that is, a higher binding energy because electrons flowed toward the CoS. However, in the case of the O 1s spectrum, the peak assigned to the Ti–O bond of TiO2 was observed at 529.3 eV (Bharti et al., 2016). This peak shifted to a higher binding energy by the CoS junction, similar to Ti 2p. In particular, the area of the M−OH peak corresponding to water adsorption or structural defects at 530.6 eV increased in proportion to the amount of CoS junction. The presence of the peak because of Ti–OH generated during the junction indicated a tight bond between CoS and TiO2, which is advantageous for charge transfer, as already mentioned. However, in the case of the S 1s spectrum, the visible binding energies at 161.4 and 162.3 eV were allocated to the S2− species of CoS (Ma et al., 2018). In general, CoS is a non-stoichiometric compound, and a low-intensity broad peak in the range of 166–171 eV is known to originate from CoxSy (Ma et al., 2018); this study observed this peak. However, with the TiO2 junction, the intensity of this peak was greatly reduced. Also, the S 1s peaks shifted to lower-binding energies with the TiO2 junction. These results confirmed that the CoS and TiO2 particles were accurately and stably joined and that the electron-donating ability of TiO2 and the electron-attracting ability of CoS were synergistic, which would have a positive effect on the catalytic performance. To predict how much reactants can be adsorbed on the interfaces of junction particle, N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm curves were obtained at 77 K for the TiO2, CoS, and 1CoS@2TiO2 particles, as shown in Fig. S3. Hysteresis loops with a stepwise adsorption and desorption branch are observed at a wide range of pressures (P/Po). The porosity, average pore volume, and specific surface area of the samples were estimated from their isotherms using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, with the results shown in the tables below. Based on the IUPAC classification, the isotherm of the CoS particles was type II because of the physical adsorption of nitrogen molecules on the solid without pores (Cychosz et al., 2017). Therefore, the specific surface area of the CoS particles was very low. However, the isotherm of the nanosized TiO2 particles was type IV, and the hysteresis loop showed a large difference between the adsorption and desorption curves depending on the pressure change. Moreover, the pore volume and average pore diameter in TiO2 particle were differed greatly compared to CoS particle. It was reported that the H2 hysteresis loop for pure anatase TiO2 was ascribed to some ink-bottle-shaped pore characteristics (Zheng et al., 2001a). Probably because TEAOH, which was added as a masking agent during synthesis, acted as a template to form mesoporous TiO2 in this study. However, the fact that the specific surface area was smaller than that of a typical mesoporous material indicates that mesopores were not formed in a regular manner; only partial mesopores were formed because the amount of TEAOH is only one-tenth of that of TTIP. In the TEM image of Fig. 2, it was already observed that nanosized TiO2 particles were gathered to form partially irregular pores. In particular, for the 1CoS@2TiO2 particles, regular pores similar to those in the literature were observed in the TiO2 shell (Zheng et al., 2001), but the isotherm curve was closer to H4 hysteresis than to the H2 hysteresis of TiO2 particles. This was ascribed to the narrow-slit pores, including pores in the micropore region in the core–shell shaped 1CoS@2TiO2 junction composite (Thommes et al., 2015). The specific surface area of a particle is closely related to its particle size, and smaller particles have a larger surface area (Jeng et al., 2013). Our results support this fact: The specific surface area of the nanosized TiO2 was 86.64 m2 g−1. However, despite the large particle size of the 1CoS@2TiO2 particles joined in a core–shell structure, the specific surface area was quite large (68.79 m2 g−1), and the isotherm curve also showed a hysteresis similar to that of TiO2. Notably, in contrast to TiO2, the amount of N2 adsorbed/desorbed slightly changed according to the pressure change, which indicated that uniform micropores were formed between the CoS microcore and the TiO2 nanoshell. In general, if the surface area is large, the number of catalytically active sites increases, resulting in an increase in the catalytic performance increases (Xu et al., 1999). Therefore, from the specific surface area of the 1CoS@2TiO2 particles, it was convinced that regular pores were partially created on the 1CoS@2TiO2 surface by the core–shell junction between the CoS microparticles and the TiO2 nanoparticles."
3,Spectroscopic properties of synthesized xCoS@yTiO2 particles,"2.2 Spectroscopic properties of synthesized xCoS@yTiO2 particles The activity of the photocatalyst is related to the light-absorption ability and bandgap of the particles. Fig. 5 a shows the UV–visible absorption spectra of the solid samples. TiO2 is a direct bandgap semiconductor that absorbs light in the wavelength range of 350–400 nm, which corresponds to the electron transition from the O 2p to Ti 3d orbits (Kundu and Mondal, 2019); the obtained UV–visible spectrum of TiO2 concurs with this. However, the absorption peak gradually red-shifted toward longer wavelengths with the junction of CoS because the CoS particles absorb light in the visible region. Fig. 5b shows the bandgaps obtained from Tauc's plot (Shanmugaratnam et al., 2019) by using the obtained absorbance values. The bandgaps for the TiO2, CoS@3TiO2, CoS@2TiO2, CoS@1TiO2, and 2CoS@1TiO2 particles were 3.0, 2.7, 2.6, 2.5 and 2.1 eV, respectively. As a result, the bandgap decreased as the CoS content increased. In contrast to other samples, the absorption wavelength of pure CoS particles exceeded 800 nm, so the absorbance was measured again by the diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) method, with the results shown in Fig. 5c. The bandgap was obtained by extrapolating the linear portion of the (Fhv)1/2 versus (hv) curve toward the hv axis using the Kubellka-Munk model (El-Atab et al., 2016) at the absorption edge, which was 1.57 eV. Fig. 5d shows the valence band (VB) positions of TiO2 and CoS obtained through XPS, and the binding energies at the edges of the TiO2 and CoS curves were 2.04 and 0.26 eV, respectively. The semiconductor type of the TiO2 and CoS particles was determined from the corresponding Mott-Schottky plots (relationship between the potential and the amount of charge) (Bengas et al., 2019); Fig. 5e shows the results. The Mott-Schottky plot was measured at a single frequency of 5.0 kHz over a potential range of −1.00 V–1.20 V SCE in a 1.0 M KCl electrolyte. The positive and negative slopes of the Mott-Schottky curve represent the electron donor and electron acceptor properties, respectively (Bengas et al., 2019). Pure TiO2 and CoS particles exhibited typical positive and negative slopes, respectively. Therefore, a p-type@n-type heterojunction was used to construct the CoS@TiO2 core–shell composite for this study. The CB positions were obtained by subtracting the VB positions from the band gaps. The CB potential energies of TiO2 and CoS particles were −0.96 and −1.31 eV, respectively. The work functions (WF) for TiO2 and CoS particles were calculated by DFT (density functional theory) under the conditions provided in Fig. S4. In general, the WF is the minimum energy required to lose electrons in a material in a vacuum state. If the WF is small, the loss of electrons becomes easier, and the WF is different depending on the crystal growth direction. An energy potential diagram drawn using the CB, VB, and WF values obtained for two particles is presented in Fig. 5f. For an n-type semiconductor anatase TiO2, the WF calculated by DFT was 4.09 eV, which is almost identical to the literature (Kashiwaya et al., 2018). The Fermi level of TiO2 is higher than the conduction band edge, so negative charges can accumulate on the surface. On the other hand, the WF of CoS, a p-type semiconductor, was 4.34 eV, and the Fermi level was lower than the conduction band edge, so that positive charges could be accumulated on the surface. After all, when they are junctioned, a Schottky barrier is formed at the contact surface of the CoS and TiO2 particles, and the energy levels of TiO2 move down and the energy levels of CoS move up, resulted to that the Fermi energies must be aligned as the same level. Therefore, the energy band bending at the interface between TiO2 and CoS become larger than before junction, but the tunneling length (distance between TiO2-CB and CoS-VB) is shortened and the potential barrier width is short, thus the charge transfer become easier. Here, the CB energy of the CoS particle was located above the CB energy of the TiO2 particle, and the VB position of the TiO2 particle was located below the VB position of the CoS particle. Therefore, if the flow direction of electrons is predicted simply by considering only the energy band position, the CoS electrons located above will be transferred to the CB of TiO2. However, from the XPS and Mott-Schottky results, we expected the S-scheme charge transfer in the CoS@TiO2 core–shell composite. The detailed mechanism will be described in Section 2.4. Fig. 6 a shows the PL spectra of the samples excited at a wavelength of 330 nm. Apart from the reflected part of the incident optical radiation, some of the photons penetrating the material will be absorbed by electrons in the valence band, generating electron–hole pairs. These electron-hole pairs, called excitons, can be dissociated thermally or by an electric field to form free electrons and holes. Both electrons and holes can recombine either radiative or non-radiative. However, only radiative recombination results in photoluminescence. Four PL curves were observed at 410, 450, 465, and 525 nm for the TiO2 particles. The emission curve at 410 nm corresponded to the bandgap, and when this wavelength was substituted into Einstein's equation, the bandgap was 3.02 eV (1240/410), which was almost identical to the bandgap. The emission curves at a wavelength longer than this curve were considered to be relaxations due to interphase transitions of the excited electrons (through the TiO2 and CoS junction interface), and the intensity of the PL curves decreased with the addition of CoS. Although radiative recombination is intrinsic, non-radiative recombination depends on the presence of recombination centers, which may be crystallographic defects of an impurity. Therefore, if a material exhibits a low intensity PL spectrum at a given absorbance, larger non-radiative recombination defects are present. Consequently, the 1CoS@2TiO2 catalyst with the best hydrogen production performance in this study did not show the lowest PL intensity—that is, the lowest recombination rate between e− and h+—because the crystal did not have many defects. In general, as the intensity of the PL curve decreases, the recombination rate between electrons and holes decreases, resulting in an increase in the photocatalytic activity (Du et al., 2011). Therefore, in this study, the decrease in PL intensity in the junction particles of TiO2 and CoS indicated that recombination between electrons and holes was suppressed compared with that of the pure TiO2 particles. However, this is not always an advantage, as although adequate defects have a positive effect on catalyst performance, too many defects can be fatal to catalyst durability (Garlyyev et al., 2019). On the other hand, for the pure CoS particles, no PL curves were observed up to a wavelength of 600 nm. By using a 600 nm laser, a very low-intensity PL curve was obtained at approximately 825 nm, as shown in Fig. 6b. However, substituting the wavelength value of this PL curve into Einstein's equation resulted in a bandgap of 1.5 eV (1240/825), which was almost identical to the bandgap shown in Fig. 5. Because no other PL curves corresponded to an electron transition, the electrons in the CoS particles did not relax through interphase transitions after they were excited from S 2p to Co 3d but remained within the core. Eventually, the electrons excited in the pure CoS particles did not flow into the TiO2 particles and appeared to relax immediately. Therefore, the electrons excited from the TiO2 particles can move to the CoS particles through the interphase transition, but the electrons excited from the CoS particles cannot transfer back to the TiO2 particles. The photocurrent density response of the particles was measured, and the results are shown in Fig. 6c. Photocatalytic activity is affected by the rate of recombination between electrons and holes and the movement rate of electrons on the catalyst surface. When electron transfer occurs effectively on the catalyst surface, the photocurrent increases and the photocatalytic activity improves (Wang et al., 2011). In the light-on-off cycle, the photocurrent density was lowest for the CoS particles and slightly larger for the TiO2 particles. However, the photocurrent density in the xCoS@yTiO2 particles joined with CoS and TiO2 increased significantly, which is consistent with the PL results. In particular, the 1CoS@2TiO2 particles showed the largest photocurrent density, and a constant and large current density of 12.0 μA cm−2 was observed even in the fifth cycle. Importantly, the long-term stability of charge separation is related to the lifetime of the photocatalyst. Therefore, the photocurrent density was measured under constant light irradiation for the CoS, TiO2, and 1CoS@2TiO2 particles, and the decay of the photocurrent density with time is shown in Fig. 6d. When the light was turned on, the photocurrent density rapidly increased to reach a steady state, and the current density remained stable while a balance was established between the generation, separation, transport, and recombination of the charge carriers. As a result of measuring the photocurrent change for 900 s, the current density of the 1CoS@2TiO2 core–shell junction particles was higher than those of the pure CoS and TiO2 particles by 12 μA cm−2. In addition, the current density did not decrease even after 900 s but instead increased slightly. From this result, it was confirmed that activated electrons and holes were effectively separated at the junction interface in the 1CoS@2TiO2 particles, even after 900 s."
4,Hydrogen production performance by water splitting on xCoS@yTiO2 particles using lactic acid as a sacrificial agent,"2.3 Hydrogen production performance by water splitting on xCoS@yTiO2 particles using lactic acid as a sacrificial agent Hydrogen production from water splitting was carried out using the photoreactor shown in Fig. 7 a and by using a 150 W Xe lamp without a UV filter. First, 0.01 g of the catalyst powder was dispersed in a 150 mL volumetric flask containing 60 mL deionized water. To this solution, 10 vol% of lactic acid was added as a sacrificial agent. During 10 h of photoreaction, the generated hydrogen gas was fractionated using a 150 μL syringe at 1 h intervals and the amount was quantitatively analyzed using a gas chromatography machine equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. As shown in Fig. 7b, as the photoreaction time increased, the amount of hydrogen produced with all the catalysts increased according to the first-order rate equation. The amount of hydrogen generated after 10 h of photoreaction increased in the order TiO2<CoS<2CoS@1TiO2<1CoS@1TiO2<1CoS@3TiO2<1CoS@2TiO2. In particular, the amount of generated hydrogen slightly increased up to the 1CoS@1TiO2 junction catalyst and then rapidly increased to 1945 μmol in the 1CoS@2TiO2 junction catalyst. However, in the 1CoS@3TiO2 junction catalyst, the amount of hydrogen generated again decreased to 742 μmol. This result indicates that the optimum mixing ratio of CoS to TiO2 that delivered the best catalytic performance in this study was 1:2. However, the large increase in the amount of generated hydrogen indicated that the added lactic acid acted as a hole scavenger. In many studies, various organic compounds—such as alcohols, organic acids, and hydrocarbons—have been used as hole removers (electron donors or hole scavengers) for photocatalytic H2 generation. The lactic acid used in this study can be decomposed in the hole during the hydrogen evolution reaction process and eventually converted to CO2 and H2O through an intermediate pathway to produce alcohols, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids as intermediates (Ran et al., 2020). To clearly distinguish the hydrogen production as a function of the junction ration of CoS and TiO2, Fig. S5a shows a plot of the logarithmic form for the hydrogen generation versus the solar irradiation time for the same reaction as in Fig. 7b. These showed different rates of hydrogen production in two parts, showed a steep slope up to 3 h of the initial reaction and then a gentle straight line thereafter. The reason for the rapid initial reaction rate is probably due to the H+ effect caused by the decomposition of lactic acid added as a sacrificial agent. But the overall reactions illustrate that the catalytic water splitting depends on the solar irradiation time. Eventually, the hydrogen generation rate can be determined by using the straight linear portion of each plot of the water-splitting reaction performed with different catalyst nanoparticles; note that the water-splitting reaction rate is the fastest in the 1CoS@2TiO2 junction particle with the most inclined linear slope. Table S1 shows a comparison of the hydrogen production when CoxSy is used as a co-catalyst with various main catalysts. Wang et al. compared the hydrogen production according to the type of sacrificial agent in the Co3S4-g-C3N4 catalyst and found that the hydrogen evolution decreased in the order of 15% triethanolamine (TEOA) solution >10% methanol > Na2S/Na2SO3>10% lactic acid (Wang et al., 2021). Specifically, they reported that the difference in hydrogen production when lactic acid and TEOA were added reached 2120 times. Moreover, they concluded that the pH of the reaction solution affected the hydrogen production, and hydrogen production was promoted more in the basic solution than in the acidic solution because the base anions were more strongly adsorbed to the holes−VBs of the main catalyst. As in the examples presented, when the TEOA sacrificial agent was used, the hydrogen production was quite high under the 5 W-LED light source regardless of the catalyst type and were distributed from 3178 to 5594 μmol g−1∙h−1 (Li et al., 2019, 2021; Li and Xu, 2020; Ma et al., 2020). However, even when the TEOA sacrificial agent was used, when the water splitting was performed under an Xe-lamp, the hydrogen production was reduced to 228–578 μmol g−1∙h−1 (Li et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). When Na2S/Na2SO3 is used as the sacrificial agent, a hydrogen production of 1061 μmol g−1∙h−1 and 5150 μmol g−1∙h−1 is obtained because CdS, which has the optimum properties for hydrogen production from water splitting, is used as the main photocatalyst (Qiu et al., 2017; Tan et al., 2018). On the other hand, few reports have been released of catalyst cases in which CoS and TiO2 are joined in hydrogen production from water splitting. As similar example with ours, Gao et al. (2019) reported a hydrogen production of 380 μmol g−1∙h−1 with use of 20 vol% methanol sacrificial agent in TiO2–CoS−porous carbon (PC) catalyst. Here, to compare the performance of the catalyst developed in this study with the result of TiO2–CoS−PC catalyst, we have performed water splitting with 20 vol% methanol sacrificial agent, again: Fig. S5b shows the results. When we used the 20 vol% methanol under a 150 W Xe lamp, hydrogen production on the 1CoS@2TiO2 junction catalyst was significantly increased to 897.3 μmol g−1∙h−1, which was higher than it on the reported TiO2–CoS−PC catalyst, although the intensity of the light source was half. Consequently, the 1CoS@2TiO2 junction catalyst developed in this study is excellent for hydrogen production because CoS, which is unstable in the external environment, is safely protected by TiO2 nanoparticles; as a result, S ions are prevented from escaping into the solution during water splitting, and the CoS structure is maintained for a long time. The most important aspect of a catalyst system is its durability. Therefore, recycling experiments were conducted six times with 1CoS@2TiO2 particles, the most effective catalyst, in the presence (see Fig. 7c) and absence (see Fig. S6) of lactic acid, respectively. As shown, hydrogen production was not easy in pure water splitting because the ions generated in the oxidation/reduction process were easily recombined and water was reformed. Nevertheless, the 1CoS@2TiO2 catalyst developed in this study produced approximately 13.0 μmol∙g-1 of hydrogen (although this value was a cumulative amount produced over 10 h). We believe that this catalyst exhibits excellent performance because the TiO2 and CoS particles are connected via the core–shell structure and charge separation is effectively maintained at the junction surface. However, as the recycling number increased, the amount of hydrogen generated gradually decreased by approximately 1.0 μmol. This indicates light instability in the CoS particles during recycling. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 7c, when the 10 vol% of lactic acid was added as a sacrificial agent, the amount of generated hydrogen decreased by about 100 μmol in the third and fourth recycling experiment. However, in the fifth recycling experiment, the amount of hydrogen generated decreased to 1698 μmol∙g-1 after 10 h. This rate of decline was relatively rapid compared to that in pure water. In summary, the initial activity was excellent for hydrogen production in the presence of the sacrificial agent, but catalytic activity decreased faster in the sacrificial agent solution than in pure water during repeated recycling. This phenomenon occurs frequently with CdS catalysts, which are widely used in water decomposition (Jia et al., 2014). The observed catalyst stability up to the fifth cycle was ascribed to the stable wrapping of the CoS core with the TiO2 nanoshell. Therefore, from the results of this study, for a sulfur-based catalyst used in acid-based sacrificial agent solutions, the core–shell form that uses acid-stable nanoparticles can enhance the stability of the catalyst. As mentioned in the PL results, electron/hole recombination in the CoS@TiO2 junction particles has already been found to be slower than that of the pure particles. However, to further investigate this observation, the electron/hole recombination rate and electron transfer rate were measured from the IMVS and IMPS curves of the TiO2, CoS, and 1CoS@2TiO2 particles, and the results are presented in Fig. 8 . The IMVS circles of the 1CoS@2TiO2 particles shifted to the left compared with those of the pure TiO2 or CoS particles, and the gaps between the circles were larger, as shown in Fig. 8a. This indicates that the excited electrons or holes were well separated at the junction interface of the 1CoS@2TiO2 particles, and their recombination was slower than that of the pure TiO2 or CoS particles. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 8b, the IMPS circles of the pure TiO2 or CoS particles shifted to the right compared with those of the 1CoS@2TiO2 particles, and the gap between the circles was wider. This indicates that rapid electron transport occurred in the 1CoS@2TiO2 particles. The e−/h+ recombination time or electron transportation time (s, y-axis) was calculated by using the equation s = 1/2pfr, in which fr is the minimum value of the characteristic frequency of the virtual IMVS or IMPS (Yang et al., 2015). From the correlation between the current intensity and time, we calculated the e−/h+ recombination time and electron transportation time, as shown in Fig. 8c and d. Electron/hole recombination was faster for the CoS particles with short bandgaps and slightly slower for the TiO2 particles with longer bandgaps. For the 1CoS@2TiO2 particles, the e−/h+ recombination time was much longer than that for the CoS or TiO2 particles. As the current in these three particles increased, the recombination rate tended to increase. As shown in Fig. 8d, electron transport was much slower in the TiO2 particles than in the other two particles, which can only be explained by the distribution of electrons moving from the VBs to the CBs in the TiO2 particles. In comparison, electron transport was much faster in the CoS and 1CoS@2TiO2 particles, which can be explained by the electron trapping ability of CoS. Specifically, in the 1CoS@2TiO2 core–shell particle, CoS rapidly traps the electrons generated in TiO2 and promotes the transfer of charge carriers."
5,S-scheme charge transfer mechanism on xCoS@yTiO2 particles with core–shell shape,"2.4 S-scheme charge transfer mechanism on xCoS@yTiO2 particles with core–shell shape As is already known (Li et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2020), the S-scheme heterojunction consists of RP and OP with staggered band structures, with similar energy levels to the direct Z-scheme heterojunctions. But the oxidation-reduction ability is weak in the direct Z-scheme heterojunction, however, at the S-scheme heterojunction, an effective redox potential is maintained and the recombination of unnecessary electron-hole pairs is promoted, resulting in a rather strong redox ability. Eventually, the core–shell shaped xCoS@yTiO2 junction composite in this study is composed of RP and OP with opposite surface charges, and unnecessary electron-hole recombination occurs at the less defective junction surface accelerating electron transfer and improving charge separation. Thus, excellent photocatalytic hydrogen generation is achieved because of the strong redox reaction. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that the core–shell xCoS@yTiO2 heterojunction prepared in this study follows the S-scheme charge transfer mechanism, but it need to be proved experimentally. Spin-trapping ESR analysis was performed to detect •OH and •O2 − in H2O2 and methanol solutions by using DMPO as a free-radical trapping agent to estimate the S-scheme charge transfer path in core–shell shaped xCoS@yTiO2 junction particles: Fig. 9 presents the results. No signal was observed in the dark for all three particles of CoS, TiO2, and 1CoS@2TiO2 in Fig, 9a. However, after 10 min of simulated sunlight irradiation, a characteristic signal corresponding to DMPO–•OH appeared in all three particles; in addition, the intensity of the signal was greater in TiO2 particles than in CoS particles and increased significantly in the 1CoS@2TiO2 junction particles. As shown in Fig. 9b, the characteristic signal of DMPO–•OH increased significantly as the solar irradiation time was longer, which indicates that •OH radicals gather in the VBs of TiO2 particles over time. On the other hand, Fig. 9c shows the characteristic signal of DMPO–•O2 − was more intense than that of DMPO–•OH under simulated solar irradiation. In particular, the signal intensity was greater for the CoS particles than for the TiO2 particles, and significantly increased in the 1CoS@2TiO2 junction particles. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 9d, the characteristic signal of DMPO–•O2 − also increased with longer solar irradiation time, indicating that the •O2 − radicals gathered to the CBs of CoS particles over time. In conclusion, the spin-trapping ESR spectra in 1CoS@2TiO2 junction particles proved that the charge transfer path does not follow the type II mechanism but rather the S-scheme mechanism. Scheme 1 shows a possible mechanism for H2 production in the xCoS@yTiO2 catalysts. The electrons in the VBs of TiO2 excited by a one-sun light source similar to the wavelength of the sun are transferred to the CBs, which rapidly migrate to the VBs of CoS and recombine with the holes there. Subsequently, the electrons in the CBs of CoS with a strong reducing ability reduce hydrogen ions and induce H2 generation. The overall electron flow follows the S-scheme; in general water partitioning, O2 gas is stoichiometrically generated by the oxidation of OH− at the h+ of the VBs of TiO2. However, adding lactic acid acts as an electron donor to the hole, thereby inhibiting electron/hole recombination. Also, lactic acid decomposes to generate 12H+ and 3CO2. At this time, in the presence of a pure TiO2 catalyst, the activated CB potential for H2 production was unstable, so the H2 reduction rate was very low. However, in the presence of a xCoS@yTiO2 junction catalyst, light-induced electrons move efficiently from TiO2 to CoS, and because CoS is a good co-catalyst for reducing protons, H+ can be efficiently reduced to generate H2. Also, when the CoS and TiO2 particles are effectively joined in a core–shell, the junction interface is activated and the adsorption of the sacrificial agent can be increased. Therefore, the transfer of electrons from TiO2 to CoS can be promoted, and the recombination of electrons and holes is reduced. These effects improved catalytic activity."
6,Conclusion,"In summary, in the present work, we synthesized core–shell-shaped xCoS@yTiO2 junction composites by wrapping visible light-sensitive and unstable CoS particles within stable TiO2 nanoparticles. To confirm their catalytic activities, we added lactic acid as a sacrificial agent to evaluate water splitting performance. The key findings are as follows: 1) The core–shell shape of the junction composite through SEM, TEM, and HAADF element mapping analysis was observed. XRD and Raman spectra confirmed that CoS and TiO2 had typical hexagonal and tetrahedral structures with excellent crystallinity. 2) The specific surface area obtained from nitrogen adsorption/desorption experiments on joined particles (68.79 m2 g−1) was slightly smaller than that of pure TiO2 (86.64 m2 g−1), but larger than that of CoS (0.89 m2 g−1), indicating that the degree of adsorption of the reactants on the catalyst surface was predicted. 3) The work functions of TiO2 and CoS calculated by DFT were 4.09 and 4.34 eV, respectively, the bandgaps of TiO2 and CoS obtained from Tauc and Kubellka-Munk models were 3.0 and 1.57 eV, respectively. The CB positions of TiO2 and CoS obtained by subtracting the bandgap values from their XPS-VB positions of 2.04 and 0.26 eV were −0.96 and −1.31 eV, respectively. Furthermore, the Mott-Schottky plot revealed that CoS is an electron acceptor and TiO2 is an electron donor. 4) The PL, TRPL, photocurrent density, IMVS, and IMPS results proved that the charge transfer was faster, the electron-hole pair recombination was slower, and the charge separation was easier in the xCoS@yTiO2 junction particles. 5) For the xCoS@yTiO2 junction particles, the hydrogen production capacity was superior to that on single particles, and in particular, hydrogen production on 1CoS@2TiO2 particles was the highest at 1945 μmol g−1 after 10 h. This is thought to be because of the special stability of the core–shell type, in which the unstable core is encased by a stable shell. Also, the structure of this catalyst was stable even after five recycling experiments, and the high-efficiency catalytic activity was maintained without deterioration. 6) Finally, based on the result that more •O2 − radicals gather in the CBs of CoS and more •OH radicals in TiO2 VBs in spin-trapping ESR spectra, it was confirmed that charge transfer in the core-shell p-CoS@n-TiO2 heterojunction follows the S-scheme mechanism."
