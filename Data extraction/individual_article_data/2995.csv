0,Introduction,"Methanol is an important commodity chemical that can be used as an intermediate for producing formaldehyde, methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE), dimethyl ether (DME), and acetic acid. It is also necessary for producing plastics, resins, paints, adhesives, and other products mainly used in human life [1]. Methanol can be used directly or in combination with other chemicals as a fuel in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) and internal combustion engines [2]. The octane number of a blend of 10% methanol and 90% gasoline can be as high as 130 [1]. Methanol production raises to overcome the developing demands and because of the low-cost resources of natural gas in Iran and Russia and the shale gas development in the US, the additional high capacity of methanol production is predictable in these countries. The synthesis gas which is used for methanol production is obtained industrially by catalytic steam reforming of natural gas. The main reactions occur in methanol synthesis from CO and CO2 hydrogenation proceed as the Eqs. (1)–(3) [3]: (1) H y d r o g e n a t i o n o f CO 2 : CO 2 + 3 H 2 → CH 3 O H + H 2 O (2) R e v e r s e W a ter G a s S h i f t : CO 2 + H 2 ↔ C O + H 2 O (3) H y d r o g e n a t i o n o f C O : ( 3 ) = ( 1 ) - ( 2 ) : C O + 2 H 2 → CH 3 O H A combination of different metals and preparation methods affect the catalyst performance, therefore, research activities are continuing to develop an efficient and novel commercial catalyst for methanol synthesis [4]. It is known that Cu-based catalysts are the most commonly used catalysts for industrial methanol synthesis process from CO/CO2 hydrogenation [5,6]. Deng et al. [7]. demonstrated that the ultrafine particle Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst which was produced using oxalate gel co-precipitation has shown high activity in the methanol synthesis. Inui et al. [8] developed a synthesized method for the Cu/ZnO/Cr2O3/A12O3 catalyst by forming gelation using NH3 and used it for the production of methanol for CO2 hydrogenation. BASF developed a Cr2O3/ZnO catalyst for synthesizing methanol using CO and H2 in 1920. ICI company (Johnson Matthey) invented the commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst for methanol synthesis [9]. Ren et al. [10] synthesized a CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst using the co-precipitation method and investigated that the concentration of precursors affected on the structural properties of catalysts. The dispersion of precipitates increases with low precursor concentration, due to improving the porosity of the catalysts. ZnO prevents the agglomeration of Cu components, it is used to enhance the Cu surface area for methanol synthesis [11]. Produced water from CO2 hydrogenation reactions causes to deactivate the catalyst. Supports should be added to prevent this situation. Because the porosity and catalytic efficiencies of catalyst increase with increasing the surface area [12]. Barroso et al. [13] detect the copper and alumina spinel-phase on the diffraction curve. It was explained by the fact that after the introduction of copper ions Cu2+ into ZnAl2O4 during the calcination process, some parts of Zn2+ can be substituted by Cu2+ ions in spinel structure and creates CuAl2O4 structure. The use of rare earth elements (REE) such as La, Ce, Gd, Nd, or Sm in catalysts improves the catalyst performance because of their unique chemical characteristic [14,15]. The effect of REE on catalyst performance has been investigated for many years [16,17]. Ce was used to enhance the V2O5 Catalyst for SO2 oxidation [18]. La oxide was used for the modification of the catalyst for hydrogenation of CO2 [8]. The target of that research was producing methanol from CO2. The result showed that the strong basicity of La oxides can increase the adsorption of CO2. It enhanced the methanol yield higher than others [8]. The effects of Ce, La, and Zr on nickel/alumina catalysts were investigated for the hydrogenation of CO. The results showed that Zr, Ce, and La increased conversion of CO and CO2 to methane [19]. The presence of La on Cu/ZrO2 favors the production of methanol in CO2 hydrogenation. The optimum catalytic activity was obtained at 5% La doping [20]. Ce modified the Cu catalyst for CO selective oxidation [21]. Mn, La, Ce, Zr, and Y promoters were used in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. The results showed that they can increase the density of basic sites. The Y and Zr promoters enhanced CO2 conversion and CH3OH selectivity of Cu/Zn/Al catalysts, respectively. The dependency of CO2 conversion on the copper surface area was confirmed. Also, it was found that methanol selectivity can be an ascending function of strong/total basic sites of the catalyst [22]. The Y or La modified In/ZrO2 catalysts were used for the direct conversion of CO2 to methanol. The results show that adding La increases the reduction temperature and indicates higher temperatures for peaks of CO2-TPD [23]. The thermal stability of catalysts and their capacity for oxygen storage can be enhanced with the addition of REE to the structures. The catalyst with REE materials is divided into three main categories such as REE noble metal, REE composite oxide, and REE zeolite catalysts [17]. CO2 can be used as a carbon source in methanol synthesis, although it is produced as an undesirable component from industrial processes [24]. The utilization of CO2 is an environmentally friendly idea that has been focused in recent years [5,7,24,25]. But the main problem of this idea is the high stability of carbon dioxide for reacting to other molecules [26]. Many research works were carried out for the hydrogenation of CO2 to synthesize methanol, but this conversion has thermodynamic limitations [27]. Therefore, Cu−Co catalysts on Al2O3, ZnO, and MgO supports were investigated for CO hydrogenation and results show that adding CO2 to the feed enhances the conversion in our last work [28]. Also, the synthesis of methanol on Cu/Ce1-xZrxO2 was studied using CO/CO2/H2 feed [29]. In our work, a mixture of ZnO and Zn-Al-Spinnel-Oxides was developed that never used for methanol synthesis reaction. But only Wang et al. [30] developed a similar crystal phase and used it for fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) catalytic reactions. They reported that in their support, in addition to ZnO, the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 36.496°and 56.738° can be attributed to Zn6Al2O9 lattice planes (JCP2. 2CA: 00-051-0037), which indicated there was a certain amount of Zn-Al composite oxide formation, and it can protect the ZnO particles from agglomeration in the subsequent reduction treatment anddesulfurizationprocess. This modified support implies that the ZnO in smaller particle size can be stable at high-temperature treatment. They concluded that Zn exists in the form of ZnO and Zn6Al2O9, while Al exists in the form of Zn6Al2O9 or may be as amorphous alumina form in the catalyst. Also, Fazeli et al. [31] show that Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 can be deactivated by accelerating tests at high temperatures. Therefore, in our research, we used the accelerated deactivation tests to distinguish between different promoters and support too. In our research, the effect of adding rare-earth (La, Ce, and Sm) promoters on Cu supported on the mixture of ZnO and Zn-Al-Spinnel-Oxides have been investigated to answer these questions: Do Sm, La or Ce as rare earth elements improve the reactivity of the copper catalyst? What is the difference between La, Ce, and Sm on the novel support for hydrogenation of CO and CO2 Mixtures? Do these promoters reduce the copper sintering at higher temperatures? Are they thermal and structural promoters? Does synthesizing in two steps including synthesizing of Zn-Al-Spinnel-Oxides support at different calcination temperatures and placing Cu/Promoter on the support using precipitation deposition method have any advantages in catalyst performance and stability? Which promoter between La, Ce, or Sm is better for methanol process using CO2 and CO as the feed or CO2 without CO?"
1,Materials and methods,"Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O were supplied from JUNSEI Chem. Co. Al(NO3)3·9H2O, La(NO3)3·xH2O Na2CO3 and NaHCO3 were purchased from SAMCHUN. Chem. Co. Ce(NO3)3·6H2O was supplied from KANTO Chemical Co. and Sm(NO3)3·6H2O was purchased from SIGMA ALDRICH. The modified zinc alumina support was synthesized by the co-precipitation method. Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and Al(NO3)3·9H2O was dissolved in deionized water with a Zn/Al molar ratio of 3:1 that is greater than the stoichiometry value of half for ZnAl2O4 therefore, ZnO/Zn-Al-oxide mixture can be produced as the support. The base solution was made of NaHCO3 and Na2CO3 with deionized water. Each metal and base solution was added dropwise to the DI water under vigorous stirring at 65 °C so that the pH of the solution kept constant at 6.5. After the co-precipitation, the solution was aged at 65 °C for 5 h under vigorous stirring, and then the precipitate was filtered, washed, and dried at 110 °C for 12 h. This dried support was named as ZA110. The dried precipitate was calcined at different temperatures of 300, 500, 700, and 900 °C for 5 h under the flow of the air. These supports were coded as ZA300, ZA500, ZA700, and ZA900, respectively. When calcination temperature of 110 °C is referred, it indicates the dried support (ZA110) as an exception. The Cu-X/ZA500 (X = La, Ce, and Sm) catalysts were synthesized by co-precipitation-deposition of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and X promoter precursors including (La(NO3)3·6H2O or Ce(NO3)3·6H2O or Sm(NO3)3·6H2O) on suspended ZA500 support using a base mixed solution of NaHCO3 and Na2CO3. The molar ratio of Cu, X, and ZA500 is selected as 55: 5: 40. Metal solutions and the base solution were added dropwise to the suspension of ZA500 support in DI water under vigorous stirring and at the addition step, the temperature was held constant at 65 °C and the pH of the solution was maintained at 6.5. Aging time and temperature at mother liquid was 5 h and 65 °C, respectively. After filtering and washing, the samples were dried at 110 °C for 12 h and calcined at 300 °C. The prepared catalysts with La, Ce and Sm promoters were named CLaZA500, CCeZA500, and CSmZA500 respectively. C is the abbreviation of copper and ZA500 support was defined before. Two other samples of CZA500 and CZA700 were also synthesized with the same procedure without the lanthanum group promoters using two different ZA500 and ZA700 supports. The molar ratio of copper to the supports was fixed at 55:45. Finally, Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 (coded as CZARef.) catalyst was synthesized by the co-precipitation method using Cu: Zn: Al molar ratio of 55: 33.75: 11.25 as a reference. Solutions of Cu, Zn, and Al nitrate were co-precipitated with the base mixed solution of NaHCO3 and Na2CO3 using the same condition for precipitation, aging, drying, and calcination. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed by the PANalytical Empyrean Multi-Function XRD instrument (Netherland) at 45 kV and 40 mA using Cu-Kα radiation at wavelength 1.5406 nm. HighScore software was used for XRD peak analysis. The BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) surface areas (m2/g) of catalyst samples were measured using the N2 physisorption analyzer (Moonsorp-I, KIST, Korea) at the temperature of liquid nitrogen. The degassing procedure was performed at 120 °C for 2 h before the test to remove moisture. Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) theory was also used for pore size distribution. Reducibilities of the catalysts were measured using temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) analysis with AutoChem II 2920 (Micromatics Inc., USA) under the 50 ml/min flow of 5% H2 (Ar balance) and temperature ramp of 10 °C from 40 to 900 °C. N2O titration is also performed with a similar procedure used by Fazeli et al. [31] with AutoChem II 2920. Shortly, this analysis contains 3 main stages: 1- a first TPR using 5% H2 (Ar balance) with a heating rate of 10 °C/min from 40 to 300 °C, 2- N2O oxidation of Cu to Cu2O using 10% N2O (He balance) at 65 °C for 1 h, and 3- a second TPR using the 5% H2 (Ar balance) and a ramp rate of 10 °C/min from 40 to 300 °C. Based on the area under the peaks of first and second TPRs, the dispersion of copper and consequently copper surface area and particle size can be estimated. The details of the formula were reported in [31]. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis was performed using HRTEM FEI (Tecnai F20 G2). TEM and SAED patterns were analyzed using Gatan Digital Micrograph software (Gatan, Inc.). The thermal gravimetry analysis (TGA) was carried out using SDT Q600 V20.9 Build 20 (TA Instruments) equipped with DSC-TGA standard module. 25–27 mg of the catalyst powders were used for this instrument. Air with a flow rate of 100 ml/min has flowed on the sample during the test. After equilibrating the sample temperature at 50 °C, the sample temperature was increased to 1000 °C with a ramp rate of 10 °C/min. Hydrogen temperature-programmed desorption H2-TPD patterns were obtained by AutoChem II (Micromeritics). 50 mg of powder samples were inserted into the instrument. First, the samples were reduced with 40 ml/min of 5% H2 (Ar balance) at 270 °C for 2 h. Then, samples were cooled down to 45 °C and maintained at this temperature for 30 min under 5% H2 (Ar balance) atmosphere with the same flow rate of 40 ml/min for H2 adsorption. Finally, Ar was passed through the samples at 45 °C for purging. After equilibrating at this temperature, the samples were heated with a rate of 10 °C/min up to 900 °C while the 40 ml/min of Ar has been flowing across the TPD cell. The exit gas was passed to a TCD for detecting the desorbed H2. The Nexsa XPS System (Thermo Scientific) was used for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the fresh calcined and reduced samples. The binding energy of C1s (284.6 eV) was applied for calibration of the spectroscopy signals. Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) was used as an X-ray source. The peak deconvolution was performed using the Origin 2020 software. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analyses were performed using the R-XAS (Rigaku, Japan). EXAFS was used to measure the data in the Cu K-edge for studying the structure of copper and its electronic statements. Pure CuO, Cu, and Cu2O were supplied from Sigma-Aldrich to be used as standards for comparison to the catalysts. The Athena and Artemis software were used for the analysis of EXAFS and XANES using Fourier Transform (FT) and different chart-makings. The set up for activity tests was illustrated in Fig. 1 , schematically. Methanol synthesis reaction was performed in a fixed-bed reactor (stainless steel tube, diameter = 0.0106 m) inside a controllable electrical furnace. 0.5 g of the calcined catalyst was sieved to a size between 425 ~ 710 µm and loaded to the reactor tube. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was fixed at 4000 h−1. Catalyst samples were reduced using 10% H2 in N2 balance at 1 bar, while the temperature was increased at the rate of 5 °C/min up to 270 °C and hold at this temperature for 2 h. Afterward, catalyst samples were cooled to 180 °C and flushed with nitrogen gas for 1 h. The system was then pressurized to 40 bar. Molar percent of H2, CO, CO2, and N2 in the feed were 61.7, 23.3, 5, and 10 in a general test for co-feeding of the CO2 in the syngas feed. During the reaction, the liquid products were separated using a cold trap at –22 °C to be analyzed using off-line gas chromatograph (GC). The gas product after reducing the pressure by passing through a back-pressure regulator will go to an on-line GC equipped with TCD and FID detector. The Agilent 6890 N GC was used for the on-line separation and analysis of the gases. This GC has two parallel paths consisting of the Porapak-Q (Mesh 80/100, 1/8 in., 2 m) column connected to the TCD detector and the HP-Innowax (30 m × 0.250 mm × 0.25 μm) column connected to an FID detector. For the off-line analysis of liquid products, Agilent 7890A GC with HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.250 mm × 0.25 μm) was used. It has been equipped to the mass detector of 5975C XL MSD (Agilent Technology). The split ratio was fixed at 350 and the oven temperature program includes holding at 40 ℃ for 10 min and increasing to 120 ℃ with a ramp rate of 5 ℃/min and holding at 120 for 2 min. Helium was used as a carrier gas for both GCs. The equations for calculation of conversion and selectivity were summarized in Eqs. (4)–(5).

The procedure includes the reduction using 10% H2 (N2 balance), ramp rate of 5 °C/min and holding for 5 h at a temperature of 300 °C and after purging by N2, the samples were passivated by using diluted oxygen in N2 at a low temperature of 5 °C for 1 h and finally the temperature was increased to the ambient value."
2,Results and discussions,
3,Catalyst characterizations,"3.1 Catalyst characterizations Fig. 2a shows the XRD results of samples of co-precipitated zinc and aluminum nitrate that were calcined at different temperatures of 110, 300, 500, 700, and 900 ℃. This test was performed for understanding the crystal phase of a mixture of zinc-aluminum oxide. The results show that the dried catalyst at 110 ℃ mainly contains zinc-aluminum carbonate hydroxide crystals with a reference code of 00-0048-1024 in the rhombohedral morphology. By calcining the co-precipitated sample at 300℃, most of the zinc-aluminum carbonate hydroxide was converted to the Zn6Al2O9 spinel with a reference code of 96-900-6270 and ZnO (Reference code of 01-089-1397 in the hexagonal crystal shape). By increasing the calcination temperature up to 500 ℃, the peaks of this spinel and ZnO became sharper. At 700 ℃, this spinel decomposed to form the ZnAl2O4 spinel (Reference code of 96-900-6270 in the cubic structure) and peaks of ZnO grew to be sharper. At higher calcination temperatures i.e. 900 ℃, the peaks of ZnAl2O4 spinel and ZnO became very sharp and distinguishable from each other. According to the Scherrer equation, the crystallite sizes of narrow peaks are higher than wide peaks. As calcination temperature was increased in Fig. 2a, the peak becomes sharper and narrower. Therefore, it can be concluded that by increasing the calcination temperature, crystallite sizes of Zn-Al oxide spinel and ZnO were increased. XRD patterns of reduced and used catalysts were indicated in Fig. 2b . This figure proves the existence of Cu in a cubic crystal structure with a reference code of 98-04-3493. The main peaks are located at 2θ of 43.3, 50.4, 74.1, and 89.9. Comparison of full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the samples show that copper crystallite size of different reduced catalyst follows the order of CZA700 ≫ CZARef > CZA500 > CLaZA500 > CCeZA500 ≈ CSmZA500. This order is in the opposite direction of the BET surface area (Table 1 ) of the reduced catalyst with an exception that is: Ce and Sm promoted catalysts were substituted to each other as the following order: CZA700 ≪ CZARef < CZA500 < CLaZA500 ≈ CSmZA500 < CCeZA500. Because reduced catalysts were prepared at a harsh temperature of 300 ℃, the results also show that adding Sm, Ce or La oxide keeps the Cu crystallite size smaller after sintering during reduction and passivation procedure. The copper crystallite size (calculated by the Scherrer equation) for three reduced catalysts in the fresh form and after using at harsh tests (12 h in T = 350 ℃ and then 12 h in T = 250 ℃) were summarized in 3 last columns of Table 1. The copper crystallite size of reduced fresh CLaZA500 catalyst was 8.3 nm and after working at sever condition of T = 350 ℃ (the harsh test), it decreased to 8.9 nm that shows a 7.4% increasing in the size. The copper crystallite size of CZA500 was increased from 11.6 to 14.2 after sintering at the harsh condition that shows a 22.5% increase in the copper particle size. For the reference catalyst (CZARef), the copper crystallite size was changed from 9.5 to 12.0 which is a 25.6% increasing. It demonstrates the highest sintering of the copper. Increasing the copper crystallite size after sintering at the harsh tests follows 7.4% (CLaZA500) < 22.5% (CZA500) < 25.6% (CZARef). In the other hand, comparing the copper crystallite size in Table 1 shows that copper crystallite size was increased after sintering the catalyst at the temperature as high as 350 ℃ and this increasing follows the order of CLaZA500 < CZA500 < CZARef that proves the role of La2O3 in preventing of the copper active sites sintering. It means that since the increasing percent of CLaZA500 (7.4%) catalyst is very lower than others (22.5 and 25.6%), therefore, it can be concluded that La2O3 can protect the copper particles from sintering and can resist against the increasing the crystallite size after working at a very high temperature as 350 ℃. N2 adsorption /desorption isotherms for the samples were illustrated in Fig. 3 . The results show that the isotherms are similar to type III IUPAC isotherm and H3 type hysteresis loops and it shows that main pores of these catalysts are in the range of mesoporous. According to the curvature of adsorption and desorption (the hysteresis gap) in these isotherms, the shape of the mesoporous can be guessed. The shape can be like a frustum cone (a conical shape with a wider opening and narrower ending) because the desorption curve is not parallel to the adsorption curve. When they are parallel to each other the pore can be in the shape of a cylinder. But in this case, the curvature of the desorption curve is lower than the adsorption curve. The pore size distribution of the support, calcined and reduced samples were reported in Fig. 4 a, b, and c based on BJH theory. Fig. 4a shows that in all supports, the main peaks related to pore radius lower than 25 nm (mesopores) expect ZA700 with broad peaks at the macropores regime. The results show that by increasing the calcination temperature to 300 ℃ the mesopores were built by converting zinc-aluminum carbonate hydroxide to Zn-Al spinel oxide and ZnO. In this conversion, after removing some of the hydroxide and carbonate groups, some blank space will be remained and leads to the formation of pores. By increasing the calcination temperature to 500 ℃ the pores were not changed dramatically. But at 700 ℃, the amount of mesopores volumes decreased dramatically, and some macro-pores in the range of rp=55–85 nm appeared. At calcination temperature of 900 ℃, a small amount of mesopores volumes can be detected. Comparing Fig. 4b and c show that the most pores are in the meso-range and little changes were appeared by reduction process by decreasing the heights of the peaks at rp < 10 nm and increasing the height of the peaks at rp=10–20 nm and in a few cases at rp greater than 30 nm. The BET surface area and metal molar composition of synthesized support and catalyst samples in calcined and reduced forms were summarized in Table 1. It shows that adding the copper and the promoters into the support, increases the BET surface area. Because, the concentration of the copper in the catalyst is high, therefore copper can produce new pores after addition to the supports. But these new pores can be affected by the promoters. Especially after the reduction of the copper oxide to the copper using hydrogen at a high temperature as 300 ℃. The results show that the reducing the catalysts at a temperature as high as 300 ℃ decreased the BET surface area between 14.1 and 48.0% because at this temperature some copper nanoparticles sintered due to the exothermic nature of reduction reaction and decreased the BET surface area and also it shows that melting point of copper nanoparticles are less than its bulks. Because the melting point of copper is around 1085 ℃ that is much higher than 300 ℃ but copper nanoparticles sintered at this temperature. La, Ce, and Sm promoted catalysts show the lowest decrease by sintering and these results confirm that La, Ce, and Sm oxides can be structural promoters and hinder the sintering of nano copper particles and decreasing the pore surface area after reduction by hydrogen. Fig. 5 shows the effect of calcination temperature on the BET surface area of the synthesized zinc-aluminum oxide support. The results show that by increasing the temperature from 110 to 300 ℃, the pore surface area was enhanced dramatically. Hereafter, with increasing the calcination temperature up to 500 ℃, less than a 7% decline occurred that is not so significant. But after 500 ℃, with increasing the temperature to 700 ℃, pore surface area falls around 70%. Therefore, before the reaction test, we guess that ZA500 can be a better support than ZA700. According to XRD patterns, the spinel crystal of ZA500 may be Zn6Al2O9 but at ZA700 the existence of ZnAl2O4 spinel may be more possible. Therefore, the change in the crystal structure may be a reason for reducing the pore surface area. As calcination temperature intensified to 900 ℃, the BET surface area attained the lowest one that will not be suitable as catalyst support. According to XRD results, at this temperature, peaks of ZnO and ZnAl2O4 spinel got very sharp and distinguishable which shows the highest crystallinity and crystallite size. It can be concluded that small crystals at the temperature which they start to grow (i.e. between 300 and 500 ℃) are more desirable to achieve to highest pore volume. TPR profiles of the catalyst samples were indicated in Fig. 6 . The results show that the main peaks of all synthesized samples shifted to higher temperatures in comparison to CZARef. The CZA500 samples with the highest catalytic activity show the highest temperature at the maximum of the peaks. It confirms that at this optimum catalyst, the interaction of copper oxide and the support (including ZnO/Zn-Al-spinel oxides) is the highest. Therefore, in the reduction step, this highest interaction of copper and support make the particle size of reduced copper, smaller. Comparison of lanthanum group promoters shows that the temperature at the maximum of the TPR peaks follows the order of TCLaZA500 = 215.4 > TCCeZA500 = 204.5 > TCSmZA500 = 187.9 ℃. It shows that the interaction of La, Ce, or Sm oxides and copper follows the order of La > Ce > Sm that can be correlated by the melting point of these metal oxides in the order of La2O3(2315 ℃) > Ce2O3(2177 ℃) > Sm2O3(1345 ℃). The results of N2O chemisorption tests were summarized in Table 2 . The results show that adding La, Ce, or Sm to CZA500 catalyst enhances the copper dispersion and the copper specific surface area dramatically, and decreases the copper average particle sizes. It may be related to the interaction of lanthanide elements and copper. Comparison of CZA500 and CZA700 shows that the support calcination temperature of 500 ℃ is more suitable for producing the catalyst with a higher copper surface area and lowest copper particle size. It can be due to a higher BET surface area of CZA500 than CZA700. It can be concluded that the copper can be dispersed better on the wider pore surfaces (Table 1). Fig. 7 shows the TEM patterns of two spinel-type supports (ZA500 and ZA700) that were calcined at different temperatures of 500 and 700 ℃. Comparing these TEM patterns at 20 nm-scale shows that the average particle size of the ZA500 support is very smaller than the ZA700 support. This observation is consistent with our XRD results. In the XRD results of Fig. 2a, it can be seen that the peaks got sharper by increasing the temperature from 500 to 700 ℃, and therefore the FWHM will be reduced, and based on the Scherrer equation, the crystallite size increases. At Fig. 7a, ZnO, ZnAl2O4, and undefined crystal d-spacings were detected for the ZA500 sample using SAED analysis. Also, in Fig. 7b crystal of ZnO, ZnAl2O4 with bigger size, and more well-defined grids for determining d-spacing of crystal plans were detected for the ZA700 catalyst. It shows that increasing the calcination temperature of support led to more crystallinity and higher particle size of crystals and this observation is confirmed by XRD. Comparing the TEM patterns of ZA500 and 700 samples with a 20 nm scale line in Fig. 7, indicates that clusters of nanoparticles in ZA500 contain smaller particles. Fig. 8 shows the TEM patterns of different reduced catalysts. In Fig. 8a to e, ZnO, and ZnAl2O4 and Cu nanocrystals were detected by SAED analysis using FFT conversion. In the “CLaZA500-Reduced” sample, a crystal of La2O3 was detected and illustrated in Fig. 8b. this La2O3 particle was located between a copper and two ZnAl2O4 small nanocrystals. The copper active size near this La2O3 has the lowest size in comparison to two other detected Cu particles. Some small ZnO particles were observed near these two bigger copper particles that show copper particles surrounded by ZnO are larger than those copper particles surrounded by La2O3 and ZnAl2O4. In Fig. 8b. a Cu2O particle was detected that was located in the border of the sample that related to passivation by diluted oxygen before taking the reduced catalyst out of the rector. But the big copper particle surrounded by ZnO does not oxidize. The TEM patterns of the calcined CZA500, CSmZA500, and CZA700 catalysts were also summarized in Fig. 9 . Particles of CZA500 and CZA700 are agglomerated in some clusters of nanoparticles. It seems that the particles of CZA700 catalysts are bigger than CZA500. It can be related to the higher calcination temperature of the support of CZA700 that had a bigger size. The crystals of ZnAl2O4 detected in the CZA700 more easily because of the bigger particle size and sharper grids. The shape of CSmZA500 catalysts is very special. Their clusters have round-edge particles containing some regular spheres like bubbles. The crystal grids on CSmZA500 are very irregular and most of the catalyst surface has an amorphous structure because the crystal plans cannot be seen there. TGA weight loss and the temperature difference curves for two catalysts before calcination was plotted against the temperature from 50 to1000 ℃ in Fig. 10 . The results show that the samples of CZA500, and CLaZA500 before calcination have a similar trend of decreasing weight vs. temperature. But at 425 ℃ (that was shown by a vertical dash line), the TGA curves show the weight loss is in the order of CLaZA500 < CZA500 for the catalysts before calcination. Also, the temperature difference curves illustrate a downward endothermic peak at 362 and 384℃ for CZA500, and CLaZA500 (before calcination), respectively. It proves that copper and lanthanum precipitations on the ZA500 support (CLaZA500) decompose at higher temperatures than copper precipitation on the ZA500 support (CZA500). Also, a wide negative peak for the CLaZA500 can be seen in the temperature difference curve at around 800 ℃ without any significant changes in the weight loss at this temperature. The reason for this peak is not clear, but it can be related to a phase change due to the presence of La in the CLaZA500 catalyst. Because this peak is not available in the catalyst without La (CZA500). Fig. 11 illustrated the H2-TPD of CZA500, and CLaZA500, and CZARef catalysts. The results show that there are three regimes for the peaks. The H2 evolution peaks between 50 and 250 ℃ can be related to the desorption of hydrogen (H) on the copper active sites. The second-wide peaks in the range of 250-600 ℃ indicate the evolution of H2 which is strongly adsorbed on the copper particles or other metal oxides. The third small peaks in the region of 600-700 ℃. The temperatures at the maximum of the peaks in all three regions of CZA500 were shifted to higher temperatures. It shows that lanthanum can enhance the H2 adsorption of the catalyst and postpone its desorption to higher temperatures. High-resolution XPS results of Cu2P3/2 for the calcined and reduced catalysts are summarized in Fig. 12 a. For the calcined catalysts, Cu2P3/2 shows wide peaks with the maximum binding energy of around 933.6 eV that can be related to Cu2+ in the CuO of the calcined catalysts. Two shakeup satellites near 941 and 944 eV are also fingerprints of Cu2+. The surface area under these peaks for CZA500 is higher than others that shows the highest Cu2+ on the surface of the catalyst. This surface area for La, Sm, and Ce promoted catalysts and CZARef are in the same range and lower than CZA500. But CZA500 indicates a very small surface area under the peaks. The 933.6 eV for the reference catalyst was shifted to the lowest binding energy for other catalysts a little. For the reduced reference catalyst, a peak at 932.2 eV was seen that can be assigned to the Cu0. This peak has a shoulder at higher binding energy that can be related to Cu2+. For other reduced catalysts, the same trends as CZARef can be observable. Among them, the peak of 932.2 eV for CZA500, CLaZA500, and CSmZA500 is shifted a little toward the higher binding energies. The surface area under the peaks has the following order of CZA500 ≫ CZARef > CLaZA500 > CCeZA500 > CSmZA500 ≫ CZA700. That shows the trend of copper on the surface of the catalyst that can be different from the bulk concentration of the copper. Cu/Zn and X/Cu (X = La, Ce, or Sm) molar ratios on the surface of the catalyst and bulk phase were compared for reduced and calcined catalysts in Table 3 . The results show that except for CZARef and CZA700, Cu/Zn on the surface of the calcined catalysts is higher than the bulk of the catalysts. After reduction, the Cu/Zn on the surface was reduced for all samples. After reduction, Cu/Zn molar ratio on the surface of the catalyst follows the order of CSmZA500 > CCeZA500 ≫ CLaZA500 ≈ CZA500 ≫ CZARef ≫ CZA700. Also, X/Cu (X = La, Ce or Sm) molar ratios of promoted calcined samples are greater than the bulk. After reduction, this ratio was increase and this increasing in the CLaZA500 is very considerable. In Fig. 12a, XPS patterns of O1s for the reduced and calcined catalysts are plotted. The peak at 529.8–530.4 eV can be related to the surface oxygen that is available in the calcined catalyst but it was mainly disappeared in the reduced catalysts. The peaks in the range of 531.0–532.3 eV can be seen in the calcined and reduced form of the catalysts. Therefore, it can be assigned to the surface oxygens of the nonreducible metal oxides. These peaks for mixed metal oxides for CZA500 and CZA700 are shifted in comparison to CZARef. Also Because of existence of La, Sm, and Ce oxides in that mixed metal oxides, the peak shapes are unique in the viewpoint of range of binding energy and height. Fig. 12 c, d, and e prove the existence of La, Ce, and Sm in the correspondence catalyst which were promoted with those elements. These figures are related to the XPS spectra of La3d, Ce3p, and Sm3d for the reduced catalyst. The XANES spectra of Cu K-edge for different calcined catalysts in comparison to Cu, Cu2O, and CuO standards has been illustrated in Fig. 13 . Absorption coefficient and the first derivative of it were plotted vs binding energy in (a) and (b) parts of this figure, respectively. For making it easier to distinguish the difference between the samples, Fig. 14 was developed for analyzing the EXAFS patterns by the Fourier Transform (FT) using the Athena software. Fourier Transform of the magnitude of k3χ(k) vs. wavenumber was plotted in Fig. 14a and Fourier Transform of the magnitude of χ(R) was plotted in Fig. 14b against the apparent distance. Comparing CuO, Cu, and Cu2O with other catalysts in Fig. 14b shows that Cu-Cu interaction is low in the calcined catalysts because there is not metallic Cu in them. But most of the peaks have different patterns in comparison to the pure CuO and Cu2O. It shows that in each catalyst Cu has a special interaction with surrounded metal oxides. Because the maximum height at a different apparent distance can be observable for different catalysts and the shoulder shapes and shifting can be seen in this chart. For example, in CZARef and CZA700 the shoulder is not very clear but in CZ500, CLaZA500, CCeZA500, and CSmZA500 are distinguishable easily. The shape of the shoulder in Ce promoted catalyst is descending and, in the La, and Sm promoted catalyst is ascending and then descending."
4,Catalyst performance for CO2 + CO Co-feeding,"3.2 Catalyst performance for CO2 + CO Co-feeding 3.2.1 Effect of CO2 Co-feeding Fig. 15 illustrates the carbon and carbon monoxide conversions of CZA500 catalyst for methanol synthesize reaction at two different feeds including syngas with and without CO2 co-feeding. The results show that CO conversion of the CZA500 catalyst in the case of using CO2 in the feed increased in comparison to when there is no CO2 in the feed. This enhancement in CO conversion from 29.8 to 40.0% proves the synergetic effect of the small amount of CO2 which is co-fed to the syngas. This may be related to the mechanism of methanol synthesize that shows that CO2 accelerates the consumption of the CO. 3.2.2 Effect of reaction temperature Fig. 16 shows the effect of reaction temperature on carbon conversion and methane selectivity of CZA500, CZARef, and CLaZA500 catalysts. The results show that the carbon conversion was decreased by increasing the temperature because CO conversion is limited by equilibrium conversion, and the main reaction of methanol synthesis is exothermic. Therefore, the thermodynamic conversion of CO at high temperatures is less than lower temperatures. Also, these results illustrate that CO conversions at 250 ℃ follow the order of CZA500 > CZARef > CLaZA500, but at 350 ℃, the order was turned and CLaZA500 wins the match at this temperature. It shows that La2O3 can decrease the deactivation of copper active sites because of sintering. Methane selectivities of the catalysts at 250 ℃ are very small and by increasing the temperature, methane selectivities increase as a side reaction because CO and CO2 methanations are endothermic reactions, and at high temperatures, methanations can compete with methanol synthesize and win the thermodynamic limitations. Also, La promoted catalyst shows the lowest methane selectivity at a higher temperature of 350 ℃. Also, despite the higher CO conversion of CZARef at 300 ℃ than CZA500 and CLaZA500, the results show that CZARef at this temperature (300 ℃) has a very high methane selectivity in comparison to the others. 3.2.3 Effect of spinel support Fig. 17 compares the carbon and CO2 conversions for CZA500 and CZARef catalysts. The results show that our novel support including the mixture of ZnO and spinel of Zn-Al mixed oxides has higher activity for CO2 conversion when the feed contains syngas and a small amount of CO2. In this chart, CZA500 has the highest carbon conversion near the equilibrium conversion and this shows that the ZA500 is optimum support that can enhance the activity of the industrial CZARef catalyst dramatically. Also, CZA500 as an optimized catalyst has the highest CO2 conversion between all the catalysts which we examined. It also proves that the two-step synthesizing of the CZA500 catalyst using precipitation-deposition method is more desirable than one step synthesizing of CZARef using co-precipitation. 3.2.4 Effect of calcination temperature of spinel support Fig. 18 shows carbon and CO2 conversions of the catalyst with Zn-Al oxide support that was calcined at two different temperatures of 500 and 700 ℃. In this figure, a comparison of CZA500 and CZA700 catalysts proves that 500 ℃ is the optimum calcination temperature. For justifying the different catalyst activity there is some characterization evidence. Comparing the BET surface area of these two catalysts show that CZA500 has a higher pore surface area than CZA700, and the copper crystallite size in XRD results of CZA700 is larger than CZA500. Also, compering the TEM results of CZA500Reduced and CZA700Reduced catalysts proves that the average catalyst particle size at the calcination temperature of 500 ℃ is lower than 700 ℃. 3.2.5 CO2 conversion of promoted catalysts CO2 conversions of the La, Ce, or Sm promoted catalysts were compared to the reference catalyst in Fig. 19 . The results show that adding La, Ce or Sm enhances the CO2 conversion in comparison to CZARef. There is no significant difference in CO2 conversion of La, Ce or Sm promoted catalyst with each other after 12 h. But in the CLaZA500 catalyst, the CO2 conversion increases slowly from the start of the reaction but the others indicate an opposite trend. 3.2.6 Role of the promoters to make sintering resistant catalyst CO conversions of three catalysts (CZA500, CLaZA500, CCeZA500, CSmZA500 CSmZA700, and CZARef) at an accelerating sintering test were compared in Fig. 20 . At these tests, the copper catalysts were deactivated by the accelerated sintering using a harsh condition (reaction temperature of 350 ℃ that is very high for copper nano active sites) to simulate in a lab-scale experiment, the sintering of the catalysts during a long time in a normal operating condition of an industrial reactor. For this purpose, at the first stage, the catalysts were tested using CO2 and CO mixture as the feed at high temperature i.e. 350 ℃ for 12 h and then the temperatures of these sintered catalysts were reduced to 250 ℃ and the tests were continued for another 12 h. The results at 350 ℃ show that CO conversions of CZARef, CZA500, CCeZA500, and CZA700 become descending after 4, 6, 8, and 9 h, respectively. But the La and Sm promoted catalyst activities were never decreased over time. It shows that the existence of La2O3 (that was confirmed in the TEM pattern of CLaZA500 Reduced and also in XPS results) and Sm2O3 (that was confirmed in the XPS results) nanoparticles can help the support (ZnO, Al2O3, and spinel of Zn-Al oxides) to prevent the copper sintering. When the temperature was decreased from 350 to 250 ℃, the final CO conversions of the catalysts were increased because, at low temperatures, CO equilibrium conversion increases due to Le Chatelier's principle for the exothermic reaction of methanol synthesise. At 350 ℃, the CO conversion of CLaZA500 is higher than CZA500 that is in reverse order in comparison to 250 ℃. It means that adding La to the ZA500 support reduces CO conversion but also decreases the resistance of the catalyst to the sintering that cannot be distinguishable in a normal test at a short time in a lab-scale experiment and it needs the harsh condition for accelerating the deactivation. Fresh and sintered catalysts were tested using the same conditions that include the reaction temperature of 250 ℃ and a time of 12 h. For these tests, the carbon conversions were summarized in Table 4 . According to this table, loss% of carbon conversions due to sintering (at 350℃ for 12 h) have the order of CLaZA500 < CSmZA500 < CZA500 < CCeZA500 < CZA700 < CZARef. This trend shows that La, Sm, and spinel of Zn-Al oxide which was calcined at 500 ℃, significantly enhance the sintering resistance of the copper catalysts for the methanol synthesize reaction. 3.2.7 Product distributions Collected liquid samples were analyzed using the off-line GC for studying the product distributions including methanol and other by-products. Methane also was detected by the on-line GC. The results of product distribution based on carbon selectivities were summarized in Fig. 21 . These results show methanol selectivities at 250 ℃ for feed containing the CO/CO2/H2 mixture are in the range of 89.7–93.4% for different catalysts. The catalysts indicate higher methanol selectivities than reference catalyst but these differences are not so significant. It was found that at the selected reaction conditions, other than methane, some higher alcohols were produced. The amount of alcohol is in the order of methanol ≫ ethanol > each C3-alcohols > each C4-alcohols > C5-alcohols. Therefore, for producing methanol with high purity, purification by distillation is needed in a general methanol plant. However, the differences between selectivities of the catalysts are not significant but the reference catalyst shows lower methanol selectivity and a little higher amount of ethanol, 1-propanol, and methane."
5,Catalyst performance for only CO2 feeding,"3.3 Catalyst performance for only CO2 feeding The main target of this research was focused on the methanol production using the co-feeding of CO2 (without CO) but because of the importance of CO2 utilization, these catalysts are also examined without the existence of CO in the feed. In this section, all the tests were carried out for hydrogenation of CO2 (without CO) at 250 ℃, 40 bar gauge, H2/CO2 = 3, and GHSV = 4000 h−1. 10% N2 was also used as an internal standard in the feed. It means that the mole percent of H2, CO2, and N2 are 22.5, 67.5, and 10% in the feed, respectively. CO2 conversions for different catalyst samples were plotted against the time in Fig. 22 . All catalysts have a similar ascending trend with time and reach a steady-state after 12 h. CLaZA500 catalyst has the highest CO2 conversion of around 25% and CZARef has the lowest conversion of about 22%. It means that the activities of the catalysts for hydrogenation of CO2 (without CO) at this condition are similar and they may be limited to the thermodynamic conversion of CO2. But there are some differences in the selectivity of the catalysts. Selectivities of the catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 23 . The results show that CO selectivities of the catalysts are in the range of 51.3–57.5%. It means that this catalyst can be a candidate for reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction for producing CO from the hydrogenation of CO2. The produced CO can be separated and recycled to be used for the production of methanol again. Among all the catalysts, CSmZA500 has the highest CO selectivity and CZARef has the lowest. The other catalysts have middle CO selectivities in the same range. Methane selectivities of the catalysts are under 3.1%. It shows that the copper catalysts at these operating conditions are not a suitable choice for the methanation of CO2. CZA700 and CSmZA500 have the lowest CH4 selectivity. CZARef and CLaZA500 have the highest CH4 selectivity."
6,Conclusions,"For increasing the catalytic performance of copper catalyst for methanol synthesis, support containing the ZnO mixed with spinel of Zn-Al oxides were synthesized and optimized. The results show that the support calcined at 500℃ (CZA500) shows the highest carbon and CO2 conversion in methanol production using the CO2/CO mixture. Comparing the carbon and CO conversion for the CZA500 catalyst show that the addition of a small amount of CO2 to the syngas feed can enhance the carbon and CO conversion dramatically. The TEM results show that copper active sites that placed between the La2O3 and ZnAl2O4 have a lower size and also N2O chemisorption confirmed the lower copper particle size of La promoted catalyst (CLaZA500). The results also prove that La promoted catalyst resists against the sintering at high temperatures. At 350 ℃, the conversion of CLaZA500 is higher than CZA500, and the reference catalyst (CZARef). The loss of conversion of accelerated sintered catalyst in comparison to the fresh catalyst follows the order of CLaZA500 < CSmZA500 < CZA500 < CCeZA500 < CZA700 < CZARef that proves the role of La2O3 in preventing the copper sintering. Comparing the catalyst with optimum spinel-type support (CZA500) and reference catalysts (CZARef) indicates that carbon and CO2 conversion of the CZA500 catalyst are higher than CZARef. Therefore, using the co-precipitation-deposition method for synthesizing the catalyst on the spinel of Zn-Al oxides is better than using general co-precipitation for making Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts. The results show that the CO2 conversion of La, Ce, and Sm promoted catalyst (CLaZA500, CCeZA500, and CSmZA500) is higher than the reference catalyst (CZARef). Product distributions indicate that in addition to methanol, other alcohols are also produced and the selectivities of them follow the order of methanol ≫ ethanol > each C3-alcohols > each C4-alcohols > C5-alcohols. XPS and EXAFS and XANES were used to study the electronic structure of the surface element and their interactions. Finally, other than co-feeding, the catalysts were examined for the CO2 only as of the feed. In these tests, the CLaZA500 catalyst showed the highest CO2 conversion with methanol selectivity of 54.0 and CO selectivity of 43.3% at 250 ℃ and 40 bar."
