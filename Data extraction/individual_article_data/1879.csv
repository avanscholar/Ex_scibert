0,Introduction,"Hematite (α-Fe2O3) is one of the most popular oxide semiconductors and has been used to construct photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting applications [1–5]. Its popularity stems from its visible light absorption, its relatively good efficiency and from the easiness of its synthesis and application on electrodes. Hematite is stable in a wide pH range [6], it is considered to be non-toxic while it is very cheap since iron is one of the most abundant elements in the earth’s crust (4th most abundant element) [1]. With a band gap of about 2.0eV, it can absorb light beyond 600nm, therefore, its theoretical Solar to Hydrogen Efficiency (SHE) is >15% [4] while the expected current density can reach 14mAcm−2 [4,5]. These advantages make hematite a very promising material. However, the expected efficiencies have actually never been achieved because hematite also carries some important disadvantages. For example, it suffers from low conductivity and fast recombination due to large effective mass of its charge carriers. Thus, while for TiO2 and WO3 the hole diffusion length is ∼100μm and 100–150nm, respectively, in the case of hematite it is only 2–4nm [6]. Furthermore, electron mobility in hematite is low (10−1 V−1s−1) [7] and its excited state life time is short [8]. For this reason, it is necessary to apply hematite on electrodes in the form of thin films, in order to allow charge carriers to reach the electrode. However, hematite extinction coefficient is also low, therefore, the film must not be too thin, and thus a crucial film thickness optimization procedure should be put into effect. Finally, hematite conduction band (CB) is located around +0.4V while its valence band (VB) lies around +2.5V vs NHE [9]. Since then they do not straddle water reduction–oxidation potentials (0–1.23V vs NHE), a hematite photoanode may be good for water oxidation but a bias is necessary for water reduction. This rich combination of advantages and disadvantages has created an intense effort for the optimization of film deposition procedures and subsequently, for the construction of efficient hematite photoanodes. Hematite photoanodes have been made by several different procedures, among them, three being the most remarkable. Thus most efficient hematite photoanodes have been made by chemical vapor deposition [5,10]. A versatile synthesis procedure, allowing performance optimization by doping, has been obtained by the hydrothermal route [11–14]. An equally versatile, room temperature procedure for hematite film formation and doping is by electrodeposition [6–8,15,16]. The last procedure, which is easy to apply and interesting for industrial applications, has been adopted for the purposes of the present work. The main concern expressed in the reported studies dealing with electrochemically deposited hematite films is to find ways to improve photocurrent by metal doping. Metal dopants usually possess a valence of 2+ or 4+, i.e. different form of that of Fe3+. Doping is expected to repair defects and thus decrease electron–hole recombination. Metal doping involves a variety of dopants, for example, Pt [8], Zn and Ti [16]. Another interesting approach is to combine hematite with an oxygen evolution co-catalyst, such as Co–Pi [7]. Electrodeposition is usually followed by high temperature annealing, which affects grain size and grain boundaries and, subsequently, overall photocatalyst performance [17]. In addition, it leads to unintentional doping with Sn deriving from the FTO (Fluorine doped Tin Oxide) substrate, which is usually employed as transparent electrode [14]. This unintentional doping also contributes to modification of hematite photoanode performance so that annealing temperature becomes important also for this reason. In the present work, we have exploited this knowledge and applied it to the construction of electrochemically deposited hematite photoanodes doped with Ti4+, which seems to be among the most successful metal dopants of hematite. Almost all works employing hematite photoanodes deal with water splitting. However, there is one function, which has been almost completely neglected in the case of hematite. Water splitting is interesting and its environmental implications are obvious. Nevertheless, experience with the use of other oxide semiconductor photoanodes, for example TiO2, has shown that photoelectrochemical hydrogen production is more efficient in the presence of a sacrificial agent. Organic sacrificial agents, such as alcohols, polyols and, generally, carbohydrates can be photoelectrochemically oxidized producing higher photocurrents and smaller onset potentials resulting to higher hydrogen production efficiencies [18,19]. This is particularly interesting also in the case of PhotoFuelCells, i.e. Photoactivated Fuel Cells, producing electricity by photoelectrochemical oxidation of organic sacrificial agents [20,21]. In this respect, in the present work, we have studied the applicability of hematite photoanodes beyond water splitting to the production of hydrogen in the presence of organic sacrificial agents. We have employed a standard procedure to construct electrochemically deposited hematite photoanodes doped with Ti4+ [16]. The content of the present work involves elaboration on the method of hematite film deposition on FTO electrodes, doping with Ti4+, film optimization and characterization and presentation of some typical data on photoelectrochemical hydrogen production. Data on hydrogen production are presented both in the absence (pure water splitting) and in the presence of ethanol, which is presently used as model fuel (organic sacrificial agent)."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Titanium(IV) chloride (TiCl4), ferric chloride (FeCl3·6H2O), hydrogen peroxide 30% (H2O2), potassium chloride (KCl), potassium fluoride (KF), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), ethanol and acetone were all of A.R. Grade, were obtained from Sigma Aldrich and were used as received. All aqueous solutions were prepared with triple-deionized water using Milli-Q-Water (Millipore Corp, 18.2MΩ/cm at 25°C). SnO2:F transparent conductive electrodes (FTO, Resistance 8ohm/square) were purchased from Pilkington (USA) and carbon paste Elcocarb C/SP from Solaronix (Switzerland)."
3,Fabrication of hematite photoanodes,"2.2 Fabrication of hematite photoanodes Electrodeposition of hematite thin films was carried out by employing a 3-electrode set up with FTO as working, Ag/AgCl as reference and Pt foil as counter electrode. The FTO electrodes were cleaned ultrasonically in Millipore water, ethanol, acetone, and finally rinsed in Milli-Q water. Next, the cleaned FTO electrodes were immersed into the electrodeposition solution containing 5mM FeCl3, 5mM KF, 0.1M KCl, and 1M H2O2 [16]. For modification of hematite with titanium (Ti-modified hematite electrode), calculated amounts TiCl4 were added to the electrodeposition solution to achieve Ti/Fe nominal atomic ratios of 1%, 3%, 5% and 10%. In reality, as it will be discussed later, the actual percentages of titania detected by XPS and EDX were much higher than these nominal values. Deposition of the hematite films were obtained by applying 50 potential cycles between −0.5 to +0.5V vs Ag/AgCl at 50°C and the scan rate was fixed at 100mVs−1. Finally, the hematite-modified FTO electrodes were rinsed with Millipore water and then dried at room temperature. The obtained orange film was annealed in air at 750°C for 10min with a heating ramp of 5°C per minute. The thickness of the final film, as measured by its SEM profile, was approximately 300nm."
4,Fabrication of counter electrode for hydrogen production,"2.3 Fabrication of counter electrode for hydrogen production For the fabrication of the counter electrode, a commercial carbon paste (Elcocarb C/SP (Solaronix)) was applied on FTO by doctor blading and was annealed at 450°C for 30min. Pt was then deposited on the top using a solution of Diamminedinitritoplatinum(II) (Aldrich) in ethanol and casted on warm film lying on a hot plate at 40°C. The film was subsequently annealed again at 450°C. The final quantity of Pt on the film was calculated to be 0.1 mg·cm−2. The active area of the prepared electrocatalyst film was 3cm×5cm. Combination of carbon paste with Pt has been previously successfully tested as electrocatalyst for hydrogen production [19,22] and for this reason it was also presently employed for the same purpose. The use of the particular carbon paste Elcocarb was dictated by the fact that this material is designed to make uniform and stable films on FTO electrodes."
5,Reactor configuration,"2.4 Reactor configuration I–V measurements were conducted in a small reactor made of Plexiglas. The photoanode electrode played the role of reactor window. Its active area was 1cm×1cm. A Pt foil (2.5cm×2.5cm) was used as counter electrode. Photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted in a three-electrode configuration using a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and aqueous 1M NaOH as electrolyte. The quantity of the added electrolyte was 10ml. In some cases the electrolyte contained 5% v/v ethanol. In the case of hydrogen production, a large H-shaped reactor made of Pyrex glass was used, which could accommodate larger photoanode and counter electrodes (both of 3.5cm×5cm active area). This reactor is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 . The Pt/Elcocarb/FTO electrode was used as counter electrode. 1M aqueous NaOH without or with 5% v/v ethanol was used as electrolyte. Ethanol was added only in the anode compartment. The quantity of the electrolyte was 250ml in each compartment of the cell. The two compartments were separated by a silica frit (ROBU, Germany, porosity SGQ 5, diameter 25mm, thickness 2mm). Hydrogen was monitored on line by using Ar as carrier inert gas and by applying a bias measured vs Ag/AgCl. Illumination was made in all cases using a Xe lamp providing an intensity of 100mW·cm−2 at the position of the photoanode. The cathode compartment was sealed with appropriate fittings allowing the flow of the carrier gas and the collection of hydrogen."
6,Characterization methods,"2.5 Characterization methods Hydrogen was detected on line by using a SRI 8610C gas chromatograph. Calibration of the chromatograph signal was accomplished by comparison with a standard of 0.25% H2 in Ar. Application of electric bias and current–voltage curves were traced with the help of an Autolab potentiostat PGSTAT128N. UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded with a Shimadzu model 2600 spectrophotometer and IPCE spectra with a home-made apparatus using a Xe lamp and a series of interference filters. Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) measurements were made with a Zeiss SUPRA 35 VP, equipped with an EDX microanalysis system QUANTAX 200 Bruker AXS and XRD measurements with a D8 ADVANCE (Bruker AXS) diffractometer (Source/CuKa: 1.54Å, Power 1.6W) operating in Bragg–Brentano θ/θ geometry. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber with a SPECS LHS-10 hemispherical electron analyzer. Unmonochromatized AlKα line at 1486.6eV and analyzer pass energy of 36eV giving a FWHM of 0.9eV for the Ag3d5/2 peak was used. The analyzed area was 2.5×4.5mm2."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of undoped and Ti-doped hematite photoanodes,"3.1 Characterization of undoped and Ti-doped hematite photoanodes Hematite films were formed on FTO electrodes by electrodeposition and were doped by titanium by the same method, as explained in the Experimental section. Various nominal atomic percentages of dopant Ti4+ have been tested photoelectrochemically and it was decided that 3% nominal doping offers the best results. Thus all data presented here below were obtained with this doping percentage. The actual percentage of Ti4+ was much higher, as revealed by XPS. Fig. 2 shows the results of the XPS analysis of the Fe2O3 and Ti–Fe2O3 films. Thus, Fig. 2A shows Fe2p and Fig. 2B Ti2p photoelectron peaks. The binding energy of Fe2p3/2 for both pure and doped films is at 710.5±0.1eV while the satellite of pure hematite (Fig. 2Aa) is located at 718.6eV assigned to Fe3+ chemical state [23]. The presence of the satellite is characteristic for Fe2O3 [24]. On the contrary in Fig. 2Ab, the satellite is not obvious. Since the satellite is absent only in the Fe3O4 chemical state, we concluded that Ti doping may induce changes in the chemical environment of iron. Fe3O4 may also be expressed as Fe2O3·FeO, which means that both Fe3+ and Fe2+ coexist. It is then concluded that in the Ti-doped Hematite, Fe2O3 may be partly reduced [25]. The binding energy of Ti2p3/2 for the Ti-doped sample is at 458.5±0.1eV assigned to Ti4+(TiO2) [26]. The atomic percent of Ti, Fe and O in the doped sample is calculated from the peak area of Ti2p, Fe2p and O1s with the appropriate relative sensitivity factor and equations and the result was 27% Fe, 66% O and 7% Ti (within experimental error 10%). Therefore, the % atomic Ti doping level is 20.6%, much higher than the nominal 3%. This value was supported by EDX analysis of the films. Indeed, EDX elemental analysis gave the following percentages for O, Fe and Ti: 76%, 9.6% and 3.6%, respectively. Therefore, the ratio Ti/Fe detected by EDX was even higher, i.e. 38%. Apparently, electrodeposition favors Ti+4 loading, even though, the concentration of the Ti precursor was much lower than that of Fe. As seen in Fig. 3 , electrochemically deposited hematite attained a mesostructure composed of nanoparticles with substantial size polydispersity. Nanoparticle fusion led to particles ranging from 40 to 400nm. Such fusion was more obvious in the doped sample where nanoparticles seem to stand on a compact mass layer [16]. This is the result of high temperature annealing, which is necessary in order to make efficient hematite films [14,17]. In this respect, electrochemically deposited hematite has a disadvantage compared to chemical vapor deposited films [5,10]. Nevertheless, electrochemical method is easy, does not necessitate any sophisticated installations or procedures and for this reason it was presently chosen. The effect of annealing temperature on particle size and the subsequent effects on the quality of electrodeposited hematite photoanodes should, however, be a matter of future work. XRD lines were detected only for the FTO substrate and hematite itself but the dopant gave no detectable signal (Fig. 4 ). Thus XRD verified the formation of hematite. Diffuse reflectance absorption spectra of undoped and doped hematite were practically identical as seen in Fig. 5 . Hematite films gave semiconductor-type absorption up to about 610nm (2.03eV) but the spectra were appended by a tale extending up to 700nm. This tail existed both in undoped and in doped hematite. Interestingly, the tail was weakly active, as revealed by the corresponding action spectrum shown in Fig. 6 . The presence of a tail above the wavelength corresponding to the band gap can be associated to the existence of authorized energy states within the band gap. Such states make possible the absorption (and hence the photocurrent contribution) of photons with higher wavelength (or lower energy) than the band gap. Since the tail appears for both undoped and Ti-doped films with the same intensity, then it may be associated with oxygen vacancies in the materials. Such oxygen vacancies are usually found in oxides elaborated with facile routes such as electrodeposition or hydrothermal method, even after annealing."
9,Current voltage data obtained with hematite photoanodes,"3.2 Current voltage data obtained with hematite photoanodes Current–voltage curves were recorded by using the small reactor described in Section 2.4 and the results are shown in Fig. 7 . Hematite photoanodes gave a characteristic photocurrent with an onset at around 0.9V vs RHE. This onset shifted to smaller values in the case of Ti-doped hematite and shifted a bit further in the presence of ethanol. These values were about 100–200mV smaller than the onset reported for chemical vapor deposited hematite [5], comparable with the values reported in other electrochemically deposited hematite studies [6,7], but larger than the onset potential reported for Pt doped, electrochemically deposited hematite photoanodes [8]. The most impressive changes were, however, recorded with the photocurrent. The photocurrent recorded with undoped hematite extensively increased when doping with Ti and further increased in the presence of ethanol. A similar effect for Ti doping has been reported also in Ref. [16]. However, photocurrents obtained with both undoped and Ti-doped hematite photoanodes were substantially smaller than those recorded with chemical vapor deposited hematite photoanodes [5]. Substantially further current increase was observed in the presence of 5% v/v ethanol. Increase of current is always observed in the presence of sacrificial agents since they scavenge holes and thus limit electron–hole recombination. However, in the presence of ethanol, current doubling effects are also expected. Current doubling is the formation of unstable radicals by oxidation of the sacrificial agent and the injection of electrons by the radical into the conduction band of the semiconductor [21,27–29]. The recorded current thus mounted to about 3.5mAcm−2 at 1.6V vs RHE, i.e. just before the onset for electrolytic water oxidation. Dark current was practically zero both in the absence and in the presence of ethanol. The onset for electrolytic water oxidation, however, moved to higher potential in the presence of ethanol, i.e. to about 1.85V vs RHE. Photocurrent is obtained by electron flow from the photoanode to the counter electrode. These electrons can produce reduction reactions at the counter electrode, for example, production of hydrogen in the absence of oxygen. The quantity of hydrogen should, of course, be analogous to the value of the current. In this respect, the range of operation for photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen production, i.e. the potential range between the photocurrent onset and the water electrolytic oxidation onset is presently recorded between +0.85 and +1.85V vs RHE (or −0.13 to +0.87V vs Ag/AgCl). In the present work, we have then chosen to monitor photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen production by water splitting or ethanol photoelectrocatalytic reforming within the above range, as explained in the next subsection. Coming back to Fig. 6, it is observed that the action spectrum demonstrated a stronger activity at shorter than at longer wavelengths, even though, activity does take place up to about 700nm. IPCE spectrum did not match absorption spectrum of the corresponding hematite film. However, similar action spectra are reported also in other works, for example, Refs. [7,16,30,31] and this seems to be a particularity of the hematite photoanodes. The height of the IPCE spectrum depends on the applied bias and it is smaller for smaller applied bias. The IPCE spectrum of Fig. 6 was recorded at a bias of 0.7V vs Ag/AgCl. On the contrary, the applied bias did not affect the spectrum threshold. IPCE values are not shown for an undoped hematite photoanode since the current was then very low and the corresponding data were recorded with a lot of error."
10,Photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen production,"3.3 Photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen production Fig. 8 gives hydrogen production rates and cumulative hydrogen production in the absence and in the presence of ethanol using the large reactor described in Section 2.4 and schematically presented in Fig. 1. The photoanode was made with Ti-doped hematite and the applied bias was 0.7V vs Ag/AgCl (1.68V vs RHE). As expected, the quantity of hydrogen was much higher in the presence of ethanol, since the photocurrent was then higher and the availability of hydrogen ions, which may be reduced at the counter electrode by incoming electrons, are then also higher. Indeed, photocatalytic oxidation of aqueous ethanol at the photoanode can be described by photocatalytic reforming, which is expressed by the following equation [32,33]: (1) C 2 H 5 OH + 3 H 2 O + 12 h + → 2 CO 2 + 12 H + that justifies increased hydrogen cation availability in the presence of ethanol. This increased H+ availability explains that, even though, photocurrent increased by about 50%, the hydrogen production rate increased by almost 100%. An interesting and very characteristic result of Fig. 8, is the remarkable stability of the hydrogen production rate for several hours. Indeed, the rate value marked a plateau, which remained unchanged for 16h, both in the absence and in the presence of ethanol. This also marks the stability of the presently made hematite photoanodes, even under the strong alkaline conditions of pH 13.5. Of course, hydrogen production rate would decrease and approach the value recorded in the absence of ethanol, if its quantity were smaller so as to be consumed within the monitored time range. This was indeed verified in separate experiments. Hydrogen production was monitored also by applying other bias. As expected, it was higher at higher and lower at lower applied bias without any particularities. To our knowledge, there are no other works reporting photoelectrocatalytic ethanol oxidation using hematite photoanodes. All related works refer to pure water splitting processes. In the absence of ethanol, hydrogen production was a result of water splitting also in the present work. Comparison with other works is rather difficult to make since the conditions under which hydrogen production is monitored largely varies from one laboratory to the other, in terms of intensity of incident radiation, size of the photoanode electrode, value of pH, reactant configuration, applied bias, etc. This taken into account, the rate of hydrogen production by water splitting is presently judged as very satisfactory compared to other similar recent works [31,34]."
11,Conclusions,"Electrochemically deposited, Ti-doped hematite photoanodes can be employed in a photoelectrochemical cell for photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen production. This is possible by water splitting but it is more effective by photocatalytic reforming of ethanol, which leads to higher hydrogen production rates. The presently made hematite photoanodes demonstrated a remarkable stability for several hours of operation."
