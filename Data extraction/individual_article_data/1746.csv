0,Introduction,"Hydrogen energetics became the centre of massive investigations last year, due to one of the challenges for contemporary civilization, namely the application of clean energy and green fuels. At present, hydrogen is mainly produced from fossil fuels, such as natural gas with high temperature and pressure thermal processes by steam reforming with a parallel water gas shift reaction in large central plants. The mass production of hydrogen is also proceeded by water electrolysis, thermolysis, photolysis of hydrocarbons [1]. The processes of hydrogen emission proceeded by the pulse laser irradiation of carbon allotrope solutions dispersed in different solutions have been extensively investigated in recent years. The emission of hydrogen by the pulse laser irradiation of carbon powder in water was reported by Akimoto et al. [2]. The photochemical reaction of laser stimulated hydrogen generation from water with carbon with an alcohol additive was reported by Maeda et al. [3] who showed that ethanol improved the process efficiency more than methanol and isopropanol. Kawai and Sakata [1] reported hydrogen evolution from water using carbon and light. The application of intense pulsed lasers for the production of H2 from graphite and coal by using nanosecond a pulsed Nd:YAG laser was reported by several groups [4–8]. The application of graphene materials for hydrogen production by using light-driven water splitting was described by Xie et al. [9]. Graphene is a two dimensional (2D) single sheet of carbon atoms discovered by Novesolov and Geim [10]. Light driven water splitting by using porous graphene based materials was reported by several authors [11–13]. Recently, the efficient generation of hydrogen by irradiation of graphene foam (GF) particles dispersed in a methanol solution with continuous wave (CW) IR light diode has been observed [14]. The synthesis and morphology of GF particles and their interaction with laser light was described by us in [15]. The GF is a three dimensional (3D) bulk structure that preserves 2D graphene electronic features associated with the Dirac cone, as was shown by Zhang et al. [16]. Among the various source of hydrogen, ethanol is considered as a attractive. Due to it can be produced from biomass sources and is a one of renewable fuel [17]. Moreover, the ethanol have relatively high hydrogen content, is non-toxic and storage ease [18]. In the present work, the generation of hydrogen from ethanol solution of disperse GF particles by irradiation with CW laser diode is reported. The role of graphene as a catalyst is discussed in terms of the light driven emission of hot electrons leading to the dissociation of ethanol into H2, CH4 and CO gases."
1,Experimental,
2,Graphene foam morphology,"2.1 Graphene foam morphology GF is a low density porous 3D solid material in which carbon atoms are arranged in a sheet-like nanostructures (from a single layer to a few layers). The porous graphene particles were synthesized by the sol-gel method, described in detail in [15]. The morphology of the samples was determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), using a Philips CM-20 SuperTwin instrument operating at 160 kV and an FEI NovaNanoSEM 230 scanning electron microscope. Fig. 1 shows the morphology of the GF in SEM and TEM images. The specific surface area was determined by N2 adsorption at –196 °C using a Sorptomatic 1990 Fisons Instruments apparatus and calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The pore size distribution was determined using the Barrett, Joyner and Halenda (BJH) method. The GF particles extended the effective surface area due to a large number of submicron cavities. As calculated from BET and BJH measurements, the size of pores is in the range of 8–29 nm and the specific surface area is 40 m2/g (see: Supplementary of [19]). The optical spectra were measured using the focused beam of a continuous work (CW) 985 nm laser diode as the excitation source and an AVS-USB2000 Spectrometer (Avantes) as a detector."
3,Measurement methods,"2.2 Measurement methods The measurements of hydrogen emission from the ethanol with dispersed GF particles were carried out using the CW laser diodes. The suspension of GF particles dissolved in ethanol (4 mg/ml) was placed in a quartz cuvette with a diameter Ø 10 mm. It is known that the solubility of hydrogen in an ethanol solution is very limited, therefore an experimental attempt was made to measure hydrogen emission by the irradiation of well dispersed GF particles in ethanol in the middle of the vessel and the irradiation of GF particles at the top of the solution. The purpose of such experiments was to preliminarily estimate the yields of hydrogen production. It was found that the emission of hydrogen obtained by irradiation in the middle of the vessel was very poor. The reason is most probably related to the low concentration of GF particles and losses of laser light intensity due to scattering and transmission in the solution. More promising experimental results were observed for illuminating GF particles at the solution top. The sketch of the experimental setup for the irradiation of GF particles at the top of the solution is shown in Fig. 2 . The experiments were performed using a focused laser beam (see Fig. 2) irradiating a solution with dispersed GF particles close to the ethanol solution surface. The composition of evolved gases during the 980 nm (4 W) laser irradiation of the GF particles suspension in ethanol was measured using a mass spectrometry OmniStar QMS200 and gas chromatograph (GC-HF Chromatron) with TCD and FID detectors. The light emission spectra were measured using an AVS-USB2000 Spectrophotometer (Avantes)."
4,Experimental results,"In the course of the experiments, it was observed that the emission of gases measured for an unfocused laser beam was almost one order smaller than for the focused laser beam, so the experiments were carried out only for the focused beam. A photo illustrating the irradiation by the laser beam directed at the solution surface is shown in Fig. 3 . It was observed that the place of irradiation shows intense white light emission. Its spectrum measured with a spectrophotometer is shown in Fig. 3b. This emission intensity increased exponentially with excitation power density, as was reported by us earlier for GF in vacuum [15]. Moreover, the place of irradiation behaved very unstable and strong turbulence was observed. It was found that the most efficient generation of gases was observed when the white light emission occurred. The efficiency of gas evolution was dependent on laser power and the place of irradiation. The spot diameter of the focused laser beam was 0.1 mm. The most efficient process occurred for the maximum excitation power of 4 W. For this power, the bright white light emission was observed and the intense turbulence of liquid occurred. The measurement of the time evolution of hydrogen volume in the interval time 40 min is presented in Fig. 4 . The measured amounts of hydrogen in the experiment were characterized by three areas denoted by: A - the initial process of hydrogen generation by laser induced and photo-thermal effects (non-collimated CW excitation 980 nm 3 W/cm2); B – the amount of hydrogen during 60 s of excitation at full optical power (3 W); C – the maximal repeatable amounts of generated hydrogen. The main products of laser induced dissociation of ethanol measured in the headspace volume of cuvette with helium as carrier gas were H2 (14.34%), CH4 (10.6%), CO (5.5%) and He (69.5%). It means that hydrogen in the total evolved gas volume was the dominant fraction and made 47.25%. The time dependence of the generation of hydrogen volume VH produced at different excitation power values is plotted in Fig. 5 a. It was observed that the production volume of hydrogen increases almost linearly in time and this increase is strongly dependent on the excitation power. The dependences of the produced volume of hydrogen on the applied excitation laser power are plotted in Fig. 5b. One can see that the volume of hydrogen increases exponentially with the applied laser power. The total flow of H2, CO and CH4 gases was determined to be 156 ml/h. In this amount, the total flow of H2 was estimated to be 73 ml/h = 3.2 mmol/h for the highest power of applied IR laser 4 W, as depicted in Fig. 5b."
5,Discussion,"The laser irradiation reaction of dispersed GF particles as photocatalysts may be schematically written as ħω + GP → e− + GP−, since after the interaction of photon ħω with the graphene surface, free electrons e− are emitted. The origin of white light emission is associated with the interaction of the focused beam of an IR laser via multiphoton absorption with a GF particle leading to its ionization [15]. The process is complex and associated with simultaneous intense light emission, the photocurrent generation and photoelectron process of emitted free electrons of high kinetic energy. Under the interaction of free electrons with ethanol molecules, the processes of dehydrogenation of ethanol and formation of acetaldehyde occur: (1) 2C2H5OH + 4e− → 2C2H4OH− + 2H– → 2C2H4O + H2 + 4e− In the next step the decomposition and reforming of acetaldehyde into methane and carbon oxide occur: (2) C2H4O + 2e− → CH4 − + CO– The hydrophobic GF particle is surrounded by a local vacuum layer separating it from the liquid. Due to the interaction of photon ħω with the graphene surface, hot free electrons e−, whose kinetic energy Ekin = mv2/2 is formulated by photoelectric Einstein formula Ekin = ħω – A, where A = 4.2 eV is the work function of graphene [20], are ejected. As a result, the charge separation takes place and particles reveal both n - and p – type semiconductor domains. The velocity of the ejected electrons is very fast and reaches more than 106 m/s [21]. The white emission was observed only for the laser beam focused close to the dispersed graphene particles close to the solution surface. It is the result of the graphene ionization process due to multiphoton absorption or electron impact [15]. The intense white light emission of ejected photoelectrons, due to the ionization of graphene [14,16], leads to the violent dissociation of ethanol molecules. The energy of ejected electrons is not smaller than the energy of graphene ionization 4.2 eV. The dissociative ionization energy of ethanol is close to 10.5 eV [22], it means that more than 3 electrons must be involved in ethanol dissociation. Since the excitation energy of a pumping laser beam required to emit white light is very high the density of ejecting hot electrons must also be high. To summarize, the efficient hydrogen emission from ethanol with disperse graphene particles observed in our experiment is directly related to generation of hot electrons and photons from a irradiated surface of graphene particles due to multiphoton ionization. The emission of electrons is directly responsible for dissociation of ethanol molecules surrounding graphene particle and is assisted by emitted bright white light."
6,Conclusion,"In the present paper we reported the laser induced emission of hydrogen from ethanol with dispersed GF particles. The application of the low power continuous wave (CW) infrared laser diode instead of expensive pico- and femto-pulse lasers has not been reported in the literature so far. The dispersed porous graphene particles in ethanol served as photocatalysts. The mechanism of the laser induced dissociation of ethanol was discussed in terms of the intense ejection of hot electrons under the irradiation with infrared laser diode. The interaction of the emitted hot electrons with the solution leads to reforming ethanol and the generation of H2, CO and CH4 gases. It should be noted that the process is free of O2 and CO2 gases emission. A similar observation has recently been reported by us for the CW IR laser driven hydrogen emission from methanol with graphene aerogel as a target [19]. The most efficient generation of gases followed the laser irradiation of graphene particles close to surface of the ethanol solution when the intense white light emission was observed. This emission followed the photon driven ionization of graphene corresponding to the sp2–sp3 hybridization of carbon. The ionization process is assisted by bright white light broadband emission and the efficient ejection of hot electrons leading to the dissociation of methanol molecules. The detailed mechanism of the observed processes needs further studies. Since methane (CH4) and carbon oxide (CO) are toxic gases affecting environment and human health they can be reformed into less toxic products under laser irradiation into methanol and monocarbon or carbon clusters (3) CH4 + CO + hν → CH3OH + C Another process that can be applied for utilization of syngas composed of H2, CH4 and CO gases is a direct application to solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) to produce electric [23] or purification on palladium membranes [24]."
