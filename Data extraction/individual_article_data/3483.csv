0,Introduction,"Hydrogen, a clean and free-carbon energy, deserves special attention for the increasing energy crisis. Converting water into fuel is verified to be a friendship strategy, since it has the advantages to generate fuels even reduce greenhouse gases [1,2]. Photocatalytic water splitting to hydrogen via using semiconductors, obviously, has been adjudged a promising and sustainable method [3,4]. Particularly, cuprous oxide (Cu2O) with a direct band gap of 2.0 eV and favorable energy band positions [5–7], is identified as one of the most promising photocathodes for water reduction by solar among the investigated materials [8–11]. Furthermore, Cu2O is abundant, non-toxic, low-cost, and eco-friendly [12–14]. Unfortunately, rapid recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs [15,16] and deficient active sites for proton reduction [17,18] resulted in poor activity of bare Cu2O towards for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Therefore, to improve the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and the capability of photocatalytic HER, integration of cocatalyst on Cu2O nanocrystals has been confirmed to be one of the most effective methods. In the history of cocatalysts, noble metals (like Pt, Au, Ag) have been noted firstly to modify the photocatalytic activities of semiconductors [15,19–21], but soaring cost and scarce restricted their widespread use. Exploring abundance and inexpensive cocatalysts is urgent, hence, transitional metal compounds [22–24] are developed. Typically, transition metal sulfides act as cocatalysts have been received extensive attention as their excellent performances, such as MoS2 [25,26], WS2 [27,28], PtS [29], NiS [30], and CoS [31] et al., both of the chalcogenides cocatalysts mainly serve as adsorption sites for hydrogen atoms and finally enhance the photocatalytic performances. However, for the cocatalyst of copper chalcogenide (e.g. Cu7S4), which exhibits localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) character as the presence of plentiful Cu vacancies, and shows absorption ability in the near-infrared (NIR) region [32,33], meanwhile provides active sites, thus the improved photocatalytic properties mainly come from LSPR feature and active sites. For example, the Cu7S4@Pd nanocrystals with excellent NIR LSPR properties and photocatalytic activities towards for degradation organics were synthesized by Cui et al. [32], and the results manifested that the Cu7S4 phase serves as a plasmonic component for efficient photo-harvesting in NIR region. Other photocatalytic applications of Cu7S4 were also revealed, but principally focused on the degradation organics [34,35], photothermal [36], bactericidal [37], and light-induced water evaporation [38]. Moreover, the literatures for Cu7S4 nanocrystals applied to photocatalytic HER just acts as semiconductors [39] or templates [40] rather than acts as cocatalysts to data. Consequently, we wonder if Cu7S4 phase formed on the surface of host photocatalysts as a cocatalyst, and whether the resultant photocatalysts can enhance the photocatalytic activities of the host photocatalysts. Therefore, Cu7S4 serves as cocatalyst and is formed on Cu2O nanocubes in situ, the obtained Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs are firstly employed to photocatalytic HER. The optimally obtained Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs show obviously enhanced light harvesting, activity and stability for photocatalytic HER in neutral solution under full spectra illumination, and the hydrogen production rate can reach to 1689.00 μmol g−1 h−1 at ambient temperature. The improved photocatalytic performance is mainly ascribed to that the LSPR of Cu7S4 can significantly suppress electron-hole pairs recombination, remarkably enhance conductivity, promote electron transfer, increase the light absorption, and the Cu7S4 layers also provide active sites for proton reduction, thus the photocatalytic activity for HER is enhanced."
1,Experimental procedures,
2,Reagents and materials,"2.1 Reagents and materials Copper (II) chloride dihydrate (CuCl2·2H2O, 99.0%), sodium sulphate anhydrous (Na2SO4, ≥99%), and l-ascorbic acid (l-AA, 99.7%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O, 99.0%) was purchased from Adamas Reagent Co., Ltd. Ethanol (CH3CH2OH, ≥99.8%), ethylene glycol (HOCH2CH2OH, ≥99.5%), and isopropyl alcohol (C3H8O, ≥99.8%) were purchased from Kermel (Tianjin, China). Sodium sulphate anhydrous (Na2SO3, ≥97%) was purchased from Tianjin Fuyu Fine Chemical Co., Ltd. Deionized (DI) water was used in the entire experiments. All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductively glass (14 Ω cm−2, Nippon Sheet Glass, Wuhan) was cleaned with acetone, alcohol and deionized water for 30 min, respectively."
3,Preparation of cube Cu2O nanocrystals,"2.2 Preparation of cube Cu2O nanocrystals Cube Cu2O nanocrystals were synthesized through a modified simple solution method [41]. In detail, 0.1 M 2.5 mL CuCl2·2H2O solution and 0.2 M 7.5 mL NaOH solution were sequentially introduced into a 250 mL screw mouth glass bottle with 100 mL DI water. The precursor was stirred at room temperature with a speed of 300 rpm for 5 min until a homogeneous light-blue solution formed. 0.1 M 5 mL l-AA solution was then injected and maintained for 30 min at ambient temperature. The mixture color from light blue to limpid orange was observed, indicating the coordination between the methine of l-AA and Cu2+ cations. Afterwards, the nanocrystals were isolated by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min, then sonicated and washed thrice by redispersion with DI water and alcohol. Finally, the nanocrystals were freeze-dried and preserved."
4,Fabrication of Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs in situ,"2.3 Fabrication of Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs in situ Cu7S4-coated Cu2O nanocubes (NCs) were generated in situ by the anion exchange method [42], and varying degree of cure can be precisely controlled by adding different Moore ratios of Na2S·9H2O to Cu2O. Typically, 8.68 mg Cu2O dispersed in a 40 mL beaker with 25 mL DI water was sonication for 30 min to form a homogeneous solution. Various Moore weight of 0.1 M Na2S·9H2O were then injected after the beaker was placed in ice water of 5 °C for 5 min, and continuously stirred with a speed of 300 rpm and kept for 15 min. Cu2O on the NCs surface would be converted into Cu7S4 thin layers immediately when suspended in the Na2S solution as Cu7S4 with much smaller solubility product constant (Ksp ≈ 10−48) than that of Cu2O (Eq. (1)) [43]. (1) 14Cu2O + 16S2− + O2 + 16H2O → 4Cu7S4 + 32OH− The nanocrystals were isolated by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min, then sonicated and washed thrice by redispersion with ethanol and DI water. Finally, the nanocrystals were freeze-dried and preserved. The obtained nanocrystals were named as S-x/Cu2O, x in which represented the Moore ratio of Na2S·9H2O to Cu2O. For example, x = 1 stood for the Moore ratio is 1, and the addition volume of Na2S·9H2O is 60 μL, and the other specimens (such as, x = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20) were synthesized in a similar fashion. According to the transient photocurrents of various cure degree (Fig. S1), the S-3/Cu2O sample with the highest transient photocurrent and was selected to investigate the effect of trace sulfuration on the photocatalytic properties of Cu2O, and Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs represented S-3/Cu2O in the next context without specified explanation. Moreover, the sample just only was Cu7S4 phase as the Moore ratio of 20:10, and termed as Cu7S4 NCs, which can be verified by XRD pattern in Fig. S2."
5,Materials characterizations,"2.4 Materials characterizations Powder X-ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded by using a Brooker D8 advanced X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken on a JSM-7800F thermal field scanning electron microscope operated at 15 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) line scan and mapping analyses were conducted on a JEOL 2100F field-emission high-resolution transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV. UV-VIS-NIR spectra were tested in the spectral region of 300–2000 nm with a Lambda 750 spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer), and the bandgaps of samples were determined from the Tauc Plots with the wavelength from 300 nm to 800 nm. Defects in semiconductors can be confirmed by Fluorescence (RF-5301PC, Perkin Elmer). The surface composition, electronic structure and valence-band spectra of the specimens were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD). And all the spectra were calibrated to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV."
6,Photocatalytic hydrogen production testing,"2.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen production testing The photocatalytic water reduction was conducted in a homemade 150 mL sealed quartz glass cell with 100 mL 0.5 M Na2SO3 as sacrificial agent. Then, 10 mg photocatalyst with dry powder dissolved and sonicated in an argon flow for 30 min to eliminate oxygen. The light irradiation was a 300-W Xe lamp (Solaredge 700, China) with the full spectra, and the light power density was 100 mW cm−2. Hydrogen evolution amount was measured via gas chromatography (GC-2014, SHIMADZU) and performed for 4 h. The photostability of Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs was estimated every 4 h and the test was repeated for 5 cycles."
7,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.6 Photoelectrochemical measurements 5.0 mg of nanocrystals were dispersed in isopropyl alcohol and ethylene glycol mixed of 250 μL with the volume is 1:1, the slurry then uniformly dropped onto a 1 × 1.5 cm2 FTO glass to cover the area of 1 × 1 cm2. The FTO glass was then dried in a drying oven at 60 °C for 12 h. A standard three-electrode setup was used, the FTO glass coated with samples as working electrode (as shown in Fig. S3), a carbon rod as counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl electrode as reference electrode. The three electrodes were inserted in a quartz cell filled with 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte for photoelectrochemical measurements. Prior to testing, the electrolyte was purged with Ar for 30 min to removal the oxygen. A 300-W Xe lamp (Solaredge 700, China) with AM 1.5G simulated sunlight as light source, and the power density of light was tested to be 100 mW cm−2 for full spectrum. The transient photocurrent was measured on a CHI 660D electrochemical station (Shanghai Chenhua, China) in ambient conditions under chopped light irradiation (light on/off cycles are 10 s) at a 0 V bias potential (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) for 240 s, with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The stability tests of samples were conducted for 2 h. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves for Cu2O and Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs were measured with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1, and the potential ranged from 0 V to 0.6 V (vs. RHE). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted by using a potentiostat (CHI 660D) with the amplitude of 10 mV and a frequency from 0.01 kHz to 100 kHz. The Mott-Schottky (M–S) plots were obtained at a constant frequency of 1.0 kHz, and the electrolyte was 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The measured E FB value can be converted to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) scale via the Nernst equation (Eq. (2)) [44]: (2) E NHE = E Ag/AgCl + E°Ag/AgCl Where E NHE is the converted potential vs NHE, E Ag/AgCl the experimental potential measured against the Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and E°Ag/AgCl the standard potential of Ag/AgCl at 298 K (0.197 V). The solar energy conversion efficiency was calculated via Eq. (3) [45] showed as follows: (3) solar energy conversion efficiency = ((|J| × [V RHE – V H+/H2])/p) × 100% Where V RHE is the applied potential versus RHE, V H+/H2 is the Nernst potential for H2 evolution (0 V vs RHE), J is the photocurrent (mA cm−2) under AM 1.5G irradiation, and P is the incident solar irradiance (100 mW cm−2 for AM 1.5G)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,"Morphology, nanostructure, and composition of hybrid catalysts","3.1 Morphology, nanostructure, and composition of hybrid catalysts The optimal Cu7S4-coated Cu2O NCs are obtained after comparing the transient photocurrents (see detail in Fig. S1), and which is donated as Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs in the next. The morphology, adhesion state, size and uniformity can be detected by SEM as shown in Fig. S4, which indicates the cubic morphology, strongly integration and the average size of Cu2O and Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs are 47.28 nm and 58.27 nm, respectively. Several voids are appeared in Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs (Fig. S4b), due to the fact that the Kirkendall effect induced net directional flow of materials at the template/reactant interfaces [43], and accompanied by the increasing of particle diameter (Fig. S4). The TEM morphology of Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs (Fig. 1 a) and bare Cu2O NCs (Fig. S4a) are further revealed the cube structure. Moreover, the Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs represent a core-shell structure with a clearly heterogeneous interface (Fig. 1a). The HRTEM image in Fig. 1b displays a shrunken interplanar spacing of 0.2108 nm, which is corresponding to the (200) plane of Cu2O NCs with a well crystallized structure, as compared to the pure Cu2O NCs (shown in Fig. S5b with an interplanar spacing of 0.2130 nm). Furthermore, typical lattice fringes with an interplane spacing of 0.1948 nm is also detected in Fig. 1b, which is a powerful evidence for the presence of roxbyite Cu7S4 with (0160) lattice plane. Hence, the Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs in Fig. 1b with two sets of lattice planes can be revealed the integration of Cu2O and Cu7S4 NCs. Each element amount is described in Fig. S6, which can certify the presence of sulfur in Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs. To further confirm that the elements are Cu, O, and S and their distribution in Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs, EDS line scan and mapping analyses were conducted (Fig. 1c and d). Obviously, S element is chiefly uniformly distributed in the outer shells, and O element is primarily distributed in inner, whereas, Cu element is evenly distributed in the overall NCs. Above all, it can be induced that highly integration Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs are successfully prepared. For further determining the phase in Cu2O and Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs, typical XRD patterns are recorded in Fig. 2 a. It demonstrates that the peaks are all assigned to cuprite Cu2O (Pn-3m) with a strong (111) orientation (PDF No. 05-0667) in Cu2O NCs, and no peaks of CuO is identified. A clearly peak of (0160) lattice plane for roxbyite Cu7S4 (C2/m) (PDF No. 23-0958) can be observed in Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs. Thus, it can be concluded that Cu7S4 phase is formed on the surface of Cu2O induced by anion exchange and forming a core-shell structure (Fig. 1a). The range of 35–43° (2θ) in XRD patterns are enlarged and displayed in Fig. S7, a distinct shift is obtained for Cu2O (111) and (200) of ca. 0.006° and 0.101°, respectively. The degree shifts to higher angle may be ascribed to the presence of Cu7S4 layers, and which is agreement with the results attained in HRTEM (Fig. 1b and Fig. S5b). Consequently, a unique and uniform coverage of Cu7S4 on Cu2O surface by Kendall effect is acquired, which is demonstrated with the mapping (Fig. 1d) and XRD results (Fig. 2a). XPS survey spectra for Cu2O and Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs are depicted in Fig. S8 to confirm the surface composition, and elemental sulfur is detected in Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs. The full spectrum of Cu2O is displayed in Fig. S8a, which shows that the binding energy of O 1s at 532 eV and Cu 2p at 933 eV. For Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs (Fig. S8b), S 2p peak at 163 eV is detected as sulfuration, accompanied by the O 1s and Cu 2p peaks. However, the intensity of O 1s peak decreasing with sulfuration, implying that a certain degree of Cu2O reduction. High resolution XPS spectra of Cu 2p, O 1s, and S 2p are described in Fig. 2b, c, and d, respectively, to further verify the chemical states of each element. In Fig. 2b, Cu 2p core level XPS spectra of Cu2O/Cu7S4 and Cu2O NCs show that Cu(I) 2p3/2 and Cu(I) 2p1/2 spin-orbital components with high binding energy peaks, which locate at 931.81 eV (931.28 eV for Cu2O) and 951.59 eV (951.71 eV for Cu2O), respectively [46]. Moreover, Cu+ is the main surface species is indicated instead of zero valence Cu, which is consistent with the Cu LMM Auger peak at 916.98 eV (916.78 eV for Cu2O) of Cu(I) 2p3/2 and 917.15 eV (917.45 eV for Cu2O) of Cu(I) 2p1/2 in Fig. S9. A slight negative shift of Cu(I) 2p3/2 is observed, it can be induced that SCu(I)O bonds displace Cu(I)O bonds [47]. Obviously, a series of shakeup satellite peaks with higher binding energies are also detected in Cu2O/Cu7S4 and Cu2O NCs, which donating that the presence of Cu(II) oxide [48]. Furthermore, the intensity of Cu(II) peaks in Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs surpass that in Cu2O, and may be attributed to the amorphous character of CuO layer [47] which is undetected in the HRTEM image (Fig. 1b) and XRD patterns (Fig. 2a). From the O 1s core level spectra of Cu2O/Cu7S4 and Cu2O in Fig. 2c, the O 1s peak at 531.25 eV of Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs with negative shift relative to that of Cu2O lies at 531.40 eV, and which can be resulted from the presence of sulfur in the Cu2O lattice [48], and further supporting the SCu(I)O bonds formation. Otherwise, the binding energy of 529.87 eV for O 1s in Cu2O NCs displays the lattice oxygen [49], while this peak disappears in Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs, which also indicates the formation of SCu(I)O bonds. Chemical state of S atoms in Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs is explicated via analyzing the S 2p core levels spectrum in Fig. 2d, binding energy of S 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 lie at 161.85 eV and 163.15 eV, respectively, and manifesting the metal sulfides generation [50]. In addition, a binding energy of 168.65 eV is also observed in Fig. 2d, which can be assigned to the presence of SO4 2− functional group on Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs surface [51]. In result, the oxygen atoms on Cu2O surface have been partially replaced by sulfur atoms, which can be induced from the results of HRTEM (Fig. 1b), XRD (Fig. 2a), and XPS (Fig. 2c–d), and thus the Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs photocathode catalyst is successfully prepared."
10,Photocatalytic activity for HER,"3.2 Photocatalytic activity for HER UV-VIS-NIR absorption spectra were employed to study the light absorption and the photocatalytic capacity of Cu2O/Cu7S4 and Cu2O NCs, as reflected in Fig. 3 a. In the visible region, a broad spectrum of harvesting solar lights can be offered by the Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs (absorbance edge reaches to 635 nm of Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs, which broader than that of Cu2O is 608 nm). Moreover, a peak for NIR absorption can be observed at 1500 nm in Fig. 3a, which indicates the presence of NIR absorption in Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs sample. The Tauc plots in Fig. 3b can be calculated from the absorption spectra (with the wavelength ranges from 300 nm to 800 nm) in Fig. 3a, and the bandgap energy are 2.04 eV and 1.96 eV for Cu2O and Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs, respectively. Bandgap energy with small shrunk is observed in Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs compared to Cu2O NCs, which is due to the large absorbance edge as seen in Fig. 3a. Thus, the enhanced light absorption and shrunk bandgap energy both can be estimated that the presence of Cu7S4 layer facilitate to the photocatalytic activity. To contrast the photocatalytic H2 production quantitatively in Cu2O, Cu7S4 and Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs, which can be assessed by the GC. Cu2O, Cu7S4 and Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs were readily dispersed in DI water, and the photoexcited holes were quenched with 0.5 M Na2SO3 sacrificial solution. From Fig. 3c, negligible hydrogen production rate of Cu7S4 NCs (126.16 μmolg−1 h−1) is received under full spectra irradiation, and revealing that in the photocatalyst of Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs, Cu7S4 basically acts as cocatalyst. The Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs with higher H2 production rate of 1689.00 μmolg−1 h−1 than that of Cu2O is 986.75 μmolg−1 h−1 under the full spectra illumination, which is also demonstrated in Fig. 3c, meanwhile testify the function of Cu7S4 in photocatalysis. In addition, the photostability of Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs was evacuated every 4 h and the durability test was repeated for 5 times. As can be seen from Fig. 3d, the photocatalytic stability of Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs is only little decline (≤6%) in HER via solar after the fifth cycle. Moreover, the hydrogen production can be comparable with other photocatalysts reported by references and list in Table S1. According to Table S1, the highest hydrogen production rate is obtained in this work, in part because the used sacrificial regent is facilitated to the dissociation of water. For the sacrificial regent of Na2SO3, which was dissolved in water and oxidized by photogenerated holes, then formed HSO4 − (Eq. (4)) and ionization (Eq. (5)): (4) SO3 2− + H2O → HSO4 − + H+ (5) HSO4 − → SO4 2− + H+ Reduction of H+ in aqueous solution containing the tested photocatalysts can be displayed in Eq. (6) to produce hydrogen. (6) H+ + e− → H2"
11,The reasons for enhancing photocatalytic property,"3.3 The reasons for enhancing photocatalytic property To reveal the origins of the apparently improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution for the Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs photocatalyst, a series of characterizations are conducted in both Cu2O and Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs samples. By means of consulting literatures [30,52,53], photoelectrochemical properties are deemed to be a valid proof for confirming the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and the transfer of carriers, for instance, EIS, I–V, Mott-Schottky plots, and transient photocurrent. An increased current density is observed in the polarization curves of Fig. 4 a as compared Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs with Cu2O NCs, implying that the photocatalytic activity towards for HER is promoted via the Cu7S4 cocatalyst. It may be due to that the Cu7S4 cocatalyst with superior conductivity and LSPR character [32]. Meanwhile, a high converted solar efficiency in Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs instead of that in Cu2O NCs is showed in Fig. S10. Transient photocurrent density of Cu2O and Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs under full spectrum illumination with 10 s light-off cycles is showed in Fig. 4b. Obviously, the photocurrent of Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs is superior to that of Cu2O NCs, furthermore, almost no spikes in Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs (Fig. 4b) while a distinct spike is generated in Cu2O NCs (Fig. S11), suggesting that the cocatalyst Cu7S4 layers formed on the surface of Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs in situ is beneficial to separate the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. More stable operation of Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs than that of Cu2O NCs is observed in Fig. S12, which are measured in a PEC cell (Fig. S13), and the photostability for Cu2O NCs is only of 66.47%, while the photostability of Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs increases to 74.74%. In brief, photogenerated electrons and holes recombination can be hindered with a certain mass of Cu7S4 produced on Cu2O NCs surface (Fig. 4b), thus facilitating electron transfer fast and raising photostability in Cu2O NCs (Fig. S12). For determining the carrier concentrations and flat-band potentials (E Fb) of Cu2O and Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs, M–S tests were conducted, and the results are depicted in Fig. 4c. Negative slopes are derived from the M–S plots (Fig. 4c), confirming the p-type semiconductors character with hole conduction. Furthering, the donor concentrations in Cu2O and Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs can be quantified by the Mott-Schottky equation [54] (Eq. (7)). (7) 1 / C 2 = 2 / ( e ε ε 0 N D ) ( V − V F ) − k T / e Where C represents capacitance in space charge region, e is electron charge, ε0 means vacuum permittivity (ε0 = 8.85 × 10−14 F cm−1), ε is dielectric constant of material (for Cu2O, ε = 6.3 [55]), V is electrode applied potential, k is Boltzmann constant, N D means carrier concentration. And the donor concentrations are then estimated from the M–S plot slops by using Eq. (8) [54] (8) N D = 2 / e ε ε 0 d 1 / C 2 / d V − 1 For Cu2O and Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs, thus, the hole concentrations are calculated to be 1.44 × 1020 cm−3 and 3.7 × 1020 cm−3, respectively, which is comparable to the typical values in references [54,55]. Besides, the Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs nearly 2.57 times hole concentration of Cu2O NCs, which implies that the presence of Cu7S4 can accelerate electron transfer. In addition, the E Fb of 1.314 and 1.291 V (vs. NHE) for Cu2O and Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs are also obtained from Fig. 4c, respectively. In addition, EIS measurement was employed to investigate the electrical transport properties of Cu2O and Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs. EIS arc radii in Fig. 4d display that a smaller semicircle of Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs than that of Cu2O NCs, manifesting that the resistance of electron transfer via the interface layer in Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs is reduced. The results certified again the effective interfacial electron-hole pairs separation and carriers transfer in the Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs. In general, the Cu7S4 layers facilitate electron transfer from Cu2O to electrolyte, resulting in an overall decreasing charge transfer resistance (Fig. 4d), and which are also consistent with the LSV (Fig. 4a) and photoresponse (Fig. 4b) results. To further interpretation the charge transfer velocity, the PL spectra are presented in Fig. 5 a, 460 nm wavelength as excitation spectra for Cu2O and Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs. Lower characteristic peak intensity in Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs is observed than that in Cu2O NCs, indicating that the photogenerated electron-hole pairs recombination rate has been markedly alleviated, and this finding is consistent with the result in Fig. 4b. Besides, the reduced PL intensity in Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs also confirms that the efficiency of interfacial electron transfer from photoexcited Cu2O to Cu7S4. Furthermore, Cu2−xS with LSPR and LSPR intensity is heavily relies on free carrier density in the form of cation deficiencies has been reported [33]. To clarify the possible involvement of Cu7S4 LSPR in Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs, LSPR absorption spectra is estimated from 600 nm to 2000 nm, compared to Cu2O NCs as shown in Fig. 5b. Cu2O NCs displays a LSPR peak only at ca. 750 nm, while the peak intensity at 750 nm is enhanced and another broad absorption spectrum (ca. 1500 nm) is also observed in Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs. Therefore, the enhanced LSPR absorption at 750 nm and extra LSPR peak emerged at ca. 1500 nm [32] can be ascribed to the presence of Cu7S4 with Cu vacancies. Moreover, LSPR effect is relative to local electrical field enhancement [32], and strong LSPR with strong local electrical field, suggesting a promising way to effectively enhance the local electrical field by introducing Cu7S4. Furthermore, electron transfer velocity can be increased by the improved local electrical field resulted from the LSPR of Cu7S4. To reveal the energy band structures of samples, the XPS valence band spectra (Fig. 6 a), Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. 4c), and bandgap energy (Fig. 3b) are conducted. Fig. 6a indicates that the VB edges of Cu2O and Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs are located at 1.819 eV and 1.664 eV, respectively. Combining the results from Figs. 3b, 4c and 6a, the energy level diagrams of Cu2O and Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs can be deduced (Fig. 6b). As the band alignment shown in Fig. 6b, the bandgap in Cu2O and Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs are both large enough (≥1.6 eV) to split water, meanwhile, small enough (≤2.2 eV) to harvest much light in a wide range [56]. However, reduced bandgap and more negative of CB relative to HER potential can be attained in Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs, so large driving force for water reduction can be gained and accompanied by the absorption edge increasing. Moreover, it can be seen that the E Fb of Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs with much smaller difference value with the normal hydrogen and oxygen evolution potential, meaning the remained electrons decreased, and further displays that more electrons are transferred from Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs surface to electrolyte. Therefore, based on the above data and analysis, the possible mechanism is proposed and illustrated in Fig. 7 . Firstly, interfacial charge equilibrium is established between Cu2O and Cu7S4 interaction in Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs. Electrons in the VB can be excited to the CB with holes simultaneously generating in VB, as the simulated solar light with enough photon energy. Under light illumination, some of photogenerated electrons, which are distributed at the interfaces of Cu2O and Cu7S4, transfer into the Cu7S4 layers until new interfacial charge equilibrium is reached. Thus, the adsorbed H+ to H2 reduced on Cu7S4 surfaces as the photogenerated electrons from Cu2O transfer to Cu7S4, the left holes in Cu2O would have much lifetime to carry out the oxidation of SO3 2− to SO4 2− in photocatalysis (four electrons process of H2O oxidation to O2 for PEC). In detail, such a charge transfer process in Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs enhances photogenerated electrons and holes separation and the lifetime of carriers. The enhanced lifespan contributes to the multielectron processes with kinetic restraints, so particularly important for photocatalytic HER. Otherwise, the presence of Cu7S4 with LSPR can enhance visible light absorption efficiency and accelerate electron transfer, also contribute to photocatalytic HER."
12,Conclusions,"Cu7S4 as a cocatalyst and combined with Cu2O in situ is first applied to photocatalytic HER. Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs exhibit highly efficient light-driven photocatalytic activity in HER as compared to Cu2O NCs. The cocatalyst Cu7S4 could contribute to electron transfer as its well electricity, also benefit to light harvesting as the LSPR character, thus the photocurrent density and solar conversion efficiency increasing 1.5 and 1.114 times of Cu2O/Cu7S4 compared to Cu2O, respectively. Furthermore, the results indicate that the LSPR absorption of Cu7S4 in Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs also has significant contribution to the separation of photogenerated electron and holes, thus allowing the photogenerated electrons and holes to have enough time to participate the overall photocatalytic reactions. Therefore, high hydrogen production rate of 1689.00 μmolg−1 h−1 can be gained for Cu2O/Cu7S4 NCs. Finally, the strategy of the nanocrystals synthesized involving roxbyite Cu7S4 nanoparticles as a cocatalyst on a semiconductor surface and exploiting their LSPR for enhancing photocatalytic activities have considerable impact on the future development of highly efficient photocatalysts for water splitting."
