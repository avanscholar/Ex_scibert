0,Introduction,"Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting based on the PEC cell has attracted great attention because it is one possible technique to solve energy shortages and environmental pollution problems in the future [1–6]. However, single-phase semiconductor photoanodes usually exhibit undesired PEC performance such as low solar to electricity conversion and/or low solar to chemical energy conversion efficiency, greatly limiting the practical applications in hydrogen production and photovoltaics [7,8]. Therefore, it is highly important to design and construct PEC photoanodes for efficient conversion of solar energy into electricity and/or chemical energy. It is well known that photochemical reaction of a semiconductor-based photoanode during PEC water splitting process is driven by photogenerated electrons and holes of semiconductor, demonstrating that the photoproduced electrons and holes play vital roles for the PEC water splitting [7,8]. As is well known, the photogenerated electrons and holes are produced by semiconductor via absorbing solar energy. Therefore, it is a crucial issue to generate more free electrons and holes by utilizing solar energy in a semiconductor photoanode for finally achieving high reaction yield. Many approaches have been employed to enhance PEC performance of a photoanode by increasing the yields of the photogenerated electrons and holes and their separation efficiency [9–15]. Recently, the semiconductor-based photoanodes containing plasmonic nanostructures have demonstrated considerably enhanced performance in the PEC water splitting reaction [16–23]. Among these plasmonic nanostructures, noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) such as Au and Ag NPs are usually employed to decorate semiconductor to fabricate semiconductor-based plasmonic photoanodes to improve PEC activity [16–23]. In addition, non-noble metal plasmonic Al NPs also have been used to modify semiconductor to prepare plasmonic photoelectrode [24]. In the plasmonic photoanode, the plasmonic nanostructures act as dual roles of visible light harvester and hot electron provider due to their surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect [25–29]. The ability to harvest visible light of plasmonic nanostructures increases the utilization of solar energy. In addition, the SPR effect enables the plasmonic nanostructures to generate highly energetic hot electrons that can inject into the conduction band (CB) of the semiconductor across a Schottky barrier, leading to significantly enhanced PEC performance. As reported in previous studies, noble metal NPs such as Ag and Au are usually used in plasmonic photoanodes to improve PEC activity [30–32]. However, high cost of plasmonic noble metals hinders practical applications of the conventional plasmonic photoanodes. Recently, it has been demonstrated that titanium nitride (TiN), a nonmetal conductive ceramics, not only exhibits excellent metallic characteristics due to its metallic band structure and high carrier concentrations, but also displays good plasmonic behavior in the optical range from visible to near-infrared light [33–36]. Compared with the conventional noble metal nanostructures such as Au and Ag NPs, TiN NPs possess the advantages of (i) low cost and (ii) good plasmonic behavior even with similar optical properties toward conventional metal plasmonic NPs in the optical range from visible to near-infrared light [37,38]. These unique merits make TiN to be a good plasmonic material for the production of the photogenerated hot carriers and to find potential application in PEC water splitting [38–40]. For example, Wei and coauthors have reported that plasmonic TiN NPs can significantly boost PEC oxygen evolution of hierarchical nitrogen-doped TiO2 nanorod arrays (NRAs) [39]. The hierarchical TiN/N–TiO2 NRAs exhibited substantially enhanced PEC oxygen evolution and achieved a photocurrent density (3.12 mA cm−2) at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under light irradiation (AM 1.5G) [39]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no any studies have been reported on the PEC water splitting for direct hydrogen generation of TiN nanoparticle-decorated CdS NRAs under visible light illumination. This stimulates us to design and construct a visible-driven plasmonic photoanode by integrating the TiN NPs over CdS NRAs in this work. The dual roles of plasmonic TiN NPs are expected to efficiently improve visible light harvest ability and provide hot electron injection into the CB of the CdS to substantially boost the PEC performance. The integrated plasmonic photoanode shares the following advantages: (i) plasmonic TiN serves not only as a visible light harvester but also as a hot electron provider and (ii) the heterojunction built at the interface between the plasmonic TiN and the semiconductor CdS facilitates generation and separation of electron-hole pairs. As a result, the constructed plasmonic photoanode exhibits a significantly enhanced photocurrent density of 2.9 mA cm−2 under visible light irradiation without any applied bias. More importantly, the plasmonic photoanode displays an enhanced hydrogen generation rate of 101.5 μmol h−1 cm−2, about 2 times that of the bare CdS NRAs."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of CdS NRAs,"2.1 Preparation of CdS NRAs CdS NRAs grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate were prepared via a facile hydrothermal route. Briefly, two pieces of the cleaned FTO glasses were leaned against the wall of a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, followed by adding 40 mL of a mixed solution containing 1.2 mmol Cd(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.8 mmol glutathione and 1.2 mmol thiourea. The autoclave was sealed and kept at 200 °C for 8 h. The prepared samples were rinsed repeatedly with ultrapure water and dehydrated alcohol, and then maintained at 100 °C for 2 h."
3,Preparation of TiN–CdS NRAs,"2.2 Preparation of TiN–CdS NRAs TiN–CdS NRAs were prepared by a facile physical adsorption method. TiN powders with average crystal size of 20 nm were directly purchased from Alfa Aesar. Firstly, the appropriate amount of TiN NPs was ultrasonically dispersed in 50 mL of deionized water, and then FTO glasses grown with CdS NRAs were immersed into TiN nanoparticle (NP) suspension for 24 h. Finally, the samples were rinsed with ultrapure water and dried at 60 °C for 2 h. The TiN–CdS samples prepared in solution containing 1, 2 and 4 mg of the TiN NPs are referenced as TiN–CdS-1, TiN–CdS-2 and TiN–CdS-3."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization XD-3 X-ray diffractometer was used to record X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns at room temperature with Cu-Kα radiation. An ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) was used to record XPS spectra of the sample. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800) was employed to take SEM images of the samples. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100 JEOL) was used to take TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the TiN–CdS NRAs. A spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda950 UV–VIS–NIR) was employed to record UV–vis absorption spectra of the TiN NPs, CdS and TiN–CdS NRAs. A FLS920 (Edinburgh) fluorescence spectrometer was employed to record the photoluminescence (PL) spectra under the excitation of 360 nm light at room temperature."
5,PEC activity evaluation and H2 generation,"2.4 PEC activity evaluation and H2 generation A three-electrode workstation (CHI660E) was employed to collect transient photocurrent-time (I-t) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) plots, and to evaluate PEC hydrogen evolution. The counter electrode was a Pt wire. A mixed solution of Na2S (0.35 M) and Na2SO3 (0.25 M) was used as electrolyte. During the measurement process, the working electrode (TiN–CdS or CdS film) was irradiated by visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm) with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. No bias was applied referenced to Ag/AgCl electrode for I-t measurements. LSV plots were recorded at a scan rate of 0.05 V s−1. An improved displacement approach was used to collect the yields of hydrogen."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Composition and structure characterization,"3.1 Composition and structure characterization Fig. 1 a exhibits the XRD plots of the samples. The XRD pattern of the TiN NPs displays five peaks. These peaks are easily indexed to (110), (200), (220), (311) and (420) crystalline planes of TiN with the cubic phase structure (JCPDS 87–0633). Aside from the peaks of FTO substrate, the XRD plot of CdS NRAs exhibits characteristic diffraction peaks of the hexagonal wurtzite phase CdS. The peaks are ascribed to (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (200) and (203) crystalline planes of the CdS (JCPDS 41–1049). In addition, XRD patterns show that (110) peak of TiN almost overlaps (102) peak of CdS at 2θ of about 37°. After decorating the TiN NPs, the XRD plot of the TiN–CdS NRAs also displays the characteristic peaks of the hexagonal wurtzite phase CdS, no obvious peaks of TiN are observed. Low loading of TiN NPs in the sample is possibly responsible for the result. However, after careful examination for the XRD plot of TiN–CdS sample, the intensity of peak at 2θ of about 37° is slightly enhanced, demonstrating that TiN NPs are attached to the CdS NRAs. To further confirm the existence of TiN NPs in the hybrid TiN–CdS sample, XPS spectra of the sample were measured as presented in Fig. 1b–f. Survey spectrum apparently demonstrates the co-existence of Ti, Cd, N and S elements in the hybrid structure, as displayed in Fig. 1b. The elemental valence states of Cd, Ti, S and N elements were further determined by their high resolution XPS spectrum. Fig. 1c presents two binding energies at 404.5 and 411.3 eV in the high resolution XPS spectrum of Cd 3d. The lower binding energy located at 404.5 eV corresponds to Cd 3d5/2 and the higher binding energy presented at 411.7 eV comes from Cd 3d1/2 of CdS [41]. As presented in Fig. 1d, the high resolution XPS spectrum of S 2p demonstrates two peaks at 161.0 and 162.2 eV. These two peaks are attributed to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of S in the CdS crystal [41], respectively. Therefore, the measurements for the high resolution XPS spectra of the Cd and S elements evidently verify the existence of CdS in the prepared hybrid structure. Additionally, as seen in Fig. 1e, the high resolution XPS spectrum of Ti 2p presents four peaks with binding energies of 464.1, 460.5, 458.4 and 455.0 eV. According to the previous works [40,42–44], the peaks presented at 460.5 and 455.0 eV originate from 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 of Ti in the TiN, respectively, and the other two peaks presented at 464.1 and 458.4 eV are attributed to 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 of Ti in the Ti–O–N/TiO2, respectively. The existence of oxynitrides in the sample suggests that the Ti atom is surrounded by N and O atoms. This result has been demonstrated in previous works [40,42–44]. Fig. 1f displays the high resolution XPS spectrum of N 1s. The main peak displayed at 397.1 eV stems from Ti–N bond of TiN [40,42–44], while the shoulder peak presented at 396.1 eV is related to Ti–N–Ti bonds of N–TiO2 [40,42–44]. The similar high resolution XPS spectra of Ti 2p and N 1s have been reported in the TiN samples [40,42–44]. Thus, the experimental measurements of survey spectrum, and the high resolution XPS spectra of Ti 2p and N 1s evidently confirm the presence of TiN in the hybrid TiN–CdS structure."
8,Morphology and microstructure evaluation,"3.2 Morphology and microstructure evaluation SEM images of the pristine CdS and the CdS NRAs decorated with different loadings of the TiN NPs are shown in Fig. 2 . SEM images show that the pristine CdS NRAs with hexagonal prim morphology, smooth surface and the diameter of about 180 nm are grown on FTO substrate, as shown in Fig. 2a. Fig. 2b exhibits SEM images of TiN–CdS-1 NRAs prepared in a solution containing 1 mg of the TiN NPs, demonstrating that the TiN NPs attached to the surface of the CdS NRAs are very limited. Enlarged SEM images (inset in Fig. 2b) show that the TiN NPs are easily to agglomerate together due to the small size. Fig. 2c and d shows the SEM images of TiN–CdS-2 and TiN–CdS-3 NRAs, which were prepared by immersing CdS nanorod array (NRA) film into the suspension containing 2 and 4 mg of TiN NPs, respectively. The insets in Fig. 2c and d are their corresponding enlarged SEM images. Apparently, amounts of the TiN NPs attached to the surface of CdS NRAs increase with the increase of the TiN NPs in suspension. The morphology and microstructure of the prepared TiN–CdS NRAs were further studied by TEM and HRTEM. Fig. 2e and f displays the TEM and HRTEM images of the TiN–CdS nanorod, respectively. TEM image apparently shows that some TiN NPs are attached to the surface of the CdS nanorod, as demonstrated in Fig. 2e. In the HRTEM image of Fig. 2f, the lattice fringes with the interatomic layer spacing of 0.33 nm are assigned to the (002) crystallographic plane of hexagonal wurtzite phase CdS [45], the lattice fringes with the interatomic layer spacing of 0.21 nm are indexed to the (200) crystallographic plane of the cubic phase TiN [40]. Thus, the SEM, TEM and HRTEM evaluations demonstrate that the heterojunction TiN–CdS NRAs can be prepared by a facile physical adsorption of the TiN NPs on the CdS NRAs."
9,Light absorption property,"3.3 Light absorption property Optical absorption capability of the bare CdS and heterojunction TiN–CdS NRAs was evaluated by UV–VIS–NIR spectrophotometer in the region from 300 to 800 nm, as shown in Fig. 3 a. The measurements display that the TiN–CdS heterojunction NRAs exhibit the enhanced light harvesting capability in the region from 500 to 800 nm, compared to the pure CdS NRAs. The improvement for light harvesting in the region of 500–800 nm is attributed to the SPR effect of the plasmonic TiN NPs [46–50]. To confirm the SPR effect, the light absorption spectrum of the pure TiN NPs was also collected as presented in Fig. 3b. A wide SPR absorption from 400 to 800 nm with an apparent absorption peak at about 500 nm is observed. Inherent characteristic of the TiN NPs is possibly responsible for this broad spectrum absorption feature [51]. Similar wide absorption spectra of the TiN NPs and TiN/semiconductor nanostructures have been reported in previous studies [38–40]. The measurement further confirms the improved light absorption of the TiN–CdS NRAs from 500 to 800 nm is induced by the SPR effect of plasmonic TiN NPs. The results show that the decoration of plasmonic TiN NPs can considerably improve the utilization of solar energy in the TiN–CdS heterojunction NRAs. This is highly beneficial for enhancing PEC performance of the TiN–CdS heterojunction NRAs. Most importantly, the light absorption measurements show that the main SPR absorption (about 500 nm) of plasmonic TiN NPs and the intrinsic absorption (about 520 nm) of the CdS NRAs are almost overlap. This is why no obvious SPR absorption peak of the plasmonic TiN NPs is observed in the UV–vis spectrum of the TiN–CdS heterojunction NRAs, as shown in Fig. 3a."
10,PEC performance evaluation,"3.4 PEC performance evaluation We evaluated the PEC water splitting ability of the bare CdS and heterojunction TiN–CdS NRA photoanodes by a three-electrode PEC cell. Fig. 4 a shows the transient photocurrent-time (I-t) plots of bare CdS and heterojunction TiN–CdS NRA photoanodes without applying any bias under visible light irradiation. Pure CdS NRAs produce a photocurrent density of 1.8 mA cm−2, while remarkable increase of photocurrent density is achieved after attaching the plasmonic TiN NPs to the surface of CdS NRAs. The results also indicate that over loading of the TiN NPs is unfavorable for the transport and separation of the photogenerated charges, because over loading of TiN NPs is unfavorable for the transport of the photogenerated holes from the valence band (VB) of CdS to the surface of photoanode to react with the sacrificial agents of the Na2S and Na2SO3 in electrolyte. By optimizing the loading of the plasmonic TiN NPs, the TiN–CdS-2 heterojunction NRAs produce a photocurrent density of 2.9 mA cm−2, much higher than that of the bare CdS NRAs. LSV measurements further confirm the substantially enhanced PEC performance of the TiN–CdS NRAs, as exhibited in Fig. 4b. The measurements apparently demonstrate that the photocurrent density of the TiN–CdS NRAs is larger than that of the bare CdS NRAs as a bias is applied to the pristine CdS and heterojunction TiN–CdS NRAs. The substantially enhanced photocurrent density demonstrates that the TiN–CdS NRAs possibly exhibit enhanced ability to produce hydrogen via PEC water splitting reaction under visible light irradiation."
11,Photoconversion efficiency evaluation,"3.5 Photoconversion efficiency evaluation It is known that the photoconversion efficiency is very important for evaluating the PEC water splitting activity of a photoanode. As demonstrated in previous studies, the photoconversion efficiency of a photoanode can be evaluated by using the LSV measurements according to the following equation [52]: η = J p × ( 1.23 − V ) P l i g h t × 100 % In this equation, J p is the photocurrent density under visible light irradiation, V is the applied bias versus RHE, and P light is the irradiating light intensity (100 mW cm−2). Fig. 5 presents the curves of the photoconversion efficiency versus the applied potential of the pristine CdS and heterojunction TiN–CdS NRA photoanodes. The results show that the TiN–CdS NRA photoanode with optimized loading of the TiN NPs exhibits substantially improved photoconversion efficiency to the bare CdS NRA photoanode over the whole applied bias range. The highest photoconversion efficiency of the TiN–CdS NRA photoanode with optimized loading of the TiN NPs is up to 2.2%, 1.6-fold that of the pristine CdS NRA photoanode (1.4%) at 0.22 V versus RHE."
12,PEC H2 evolution,"3.6 PEC H2 evolution We further evaluated the PEC water splitting for hydrogen evolution of the bare CdS and heterojunction TiN–CdS NRAs by a three-electrode PEC cell without applying any bias under visible light irradiation for 2 h. The yields of hydrogen were collected using an improved displacement method. As exhibited in Fig. 6 a, the bare CdS NRAs achieves a hydrogen yield of 104 μmol, while all TiN–CdS NRAs exhibit an increase hydrogen generation compared to the bare CdS NRAs. After optimizing the loading of the plasmonic TiN NPs, The TiN–CdS-2 NRAs display remarkably enhanced hydrogen yield and achieves a yield of 203 μmol, about 2 times higher than that of the bare CdS NRAs. In addition, hydrogen production yields increase almost linearly with light irradiation time, showing a good stability of the bare and the heterojunction TiN–CdS NRAs during the PEC reaction. For convenient comparison, hydrogen generation rates of the bare CdS and heterojunction TiN–CdS NRAs are presented in a same histogram as shown in Fig. 6b. Hydrogen generation rate of the bare CdS NRAs is 52 μmol h−1 cm−2, while the optimized TiN–CdS-2 NRAs achieve a hydrogen production rate of about 101.5 μmol h−1 cm−2, about 2 times higher than that of the bare CdS NRAs."
13,Stability evaluation,"3.7 Stability evaluation The stability of the photoanodes was evaluated via testing the photocurrent without applying any bias under light illumination for a long time. Fig. 7 shows the photocurrent densities of photoanodes prepared by the pristine CdS and heterojunction TiN–CdS-2 NRAs under light irradiation for 7200 s. The photocurrent density of the photoanode prepared by TiN–CdS-2 NRAs retains at approximately 2.9 mA cm−2 after long light irradiation for 7200 s, while the photocurrent density of the photoanode prepared by the bare CdS NRAs decreases obviously. Thus, the measurements for the photocurrent confirm that the TiN–CdS NRA photoanode demonstrates a good photostability even under light irradiation for long time."
14,PL emission evaluation,"3.8 PL emission evaluation The transport and separation behavior of the photogenerated charges in the TiN–CdS NRAs was investigated by room temperature PL emission. Fig. 8 a shows the PL spectra of the pure CdS and heterogeneous TiN–CdS NRAs. The experimental results evidently demonstrate that the pristine CdS NRAs exhibit an obvious emission at approximately 545 nm. This emission is attributed to the intrinsic light absorption of the CdS NRAs, as demonstrated in UV–vis spectrum of Fig. 3a. However, the TiN–CdS NRAs display significantly enhanced PL emission compared to the pure CdS NRAs, as apparently demonstrated in Fig. 8a. Based on the experimental measurements, the enhanced PL emission of the TiN–CdS NRAs is attributed to the following contributions: (1) the emission contributed by the intrinsic light absorption of the CdS NRAs and (2) the emission contributed by the injection of the hot electron of the plasmonic TiN NPs into the CB of the CdS. The joint contributions of the intrinsic light absorption of the CdS NRAs and the hot electron injection of the TiN NPs lead to the remarkably enhanced PL emission of the TiN–CdS NRAs, as illustrated in Fig. 8b. Thus, the PL measurements clearly provide direct evidence that the plasmonic TiN NPs inject hot electrons into the CdS to boost the PEC activities of the TiN–CdS NRAs, as confirmed by the significant enhancement for photocurrent density (Fig. 4), photoconversion efficiency (Fig. 5) and H2 production (Fig. 6)."
15,Insight in the mechanism,"3.9 Insight in the mechanism To elucidate the enhanced mechanism for the PEC activity of the TiN–CdS NRAs, it is necessary to understand the role of the plasmonic TiN NPs in the TiN–CdS heterojunction NRAs. Firstly, we analyze the band alignment between CdS and TiN in the TiN–CdS heterojunction structure. The previous studies have shown that work function of the plasmonic TiN is 4.0–4.6 eV referenced to vacuum level, namely −0.5–0.1 eV versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) [46,47], while the CB level of CdS is about −0.4 ∼ −1.0 eV versus NHE [53–57]. Our previous work has shown that the CB level of the CdS NRAs is about −0.65 eV versus NHE [9]. Thus, when TiN NPs are attached to the surface of CdS NRAs, the energy band structure of the TiN–CdS heterojunction shows that the CB position of CdS is more negative to Fermi level of TiN, thus Schottky junction and space charge layer between CdS and TiN interface are built, leading to the formation of energy barrier of electron from CdS to TiN. Secondly, we discuss the possible role of plasmonic TiN NPs in the TiN–CdS heterojunction structure. On the basis of the energy band structure, TiN NPs possibly play two roles in the TiN–CdS heterojunction structure. One is as an electron sink, and another one is as a hot electron provider [34,38–40]. For the role as an electron sink (Fig. 9 a), TiN NPs will extract the photoexcited electrons from the CB of the CdS. As a consequence, the photoproduced electrons that transfer to the counter electrode Pt wire to take part in water reduction reaction will be decreased, resulting in the decrease of photocurrent density and PEC water splitting for hydrogen production of the TiN–CdS heterojunction NRAs, compared to the bare CdS NRAs. However, above experimental measurements undoubtedly demonstrate substantial increase of the photocurrent density and hydrogen production yield for the TiN–CdS heterojunction NRAs compared to pure CdS NRAs under bias-free visible light irradiation, indicating that the plasmonic TiN NPs do not act as an electron sink in the TiN–CdS heterojunction structure. For the role as a hot electron provider, plasmonic TiN NPs generate hot electrons under light irradiation; subsequently the photoexcited hot electrons are injected into the CB of CdS due to the SPR effect of plasmonic TiN NPs, as shown in Fig. 9b. The hot electrons injected into the CB of CdS offer additional contribution for the PEC water splitting performance, leading to the substantial increase of photocurrent density and hydrogen production yield of the TiN–CdS heterojunction NRAs. In addition, although the SPR effect of TiN NPs will result in surface plasmon (SP) decay non-radiatively via the excitation of hot electrons or radiatively via the re-emitted photons, the above experimental measurements of the PEC performance show that surface plasmons (SPs) most likely decay non-radiatively via excitation of the hot electrons. Thus the plasmonic TiN NPs serve as a hot electron provider instead of as an electron sink in the TiN–CdS heterojunction NRAs. The role as a hot electron provider of the TiN NPs was evidently confirmed by the enhanced PL emission of the TiN–CdS heterojunction NRAs, as presented in Fig. 8. Finally, the enhanced mechanism for PEC performance of the TiN–CdS NRAs is described as following: (i) plasmonic TiN NPs are excited to produce hot electrons by the irradiated light, (ii) the photoexcited hot electrons are injected into the CB of CdS due to the SPR effect of plasmonic TiN NPs, and (iii) hot electrons of plasmonic TiN together with the photogenerated electrons of the CdS transfer to counter electrode Pt wire to conduct water reduction reaction to generate hydrogen (Fig. 9c). Meantime, the photoinduced holes on the VB of CdS will migrate to the photoanode surface to react with the sacrificial agents of the Na2S and Na2SO3 in the electrolyte (Fig. 9c). The synergistic contributions of plasmonic TiN and CdS make TiN–CdS NRAs to achieve substantially enhanced photocurrent density and yields of hydrogen. It should be worth noting that the following factors also enhance PEC performance of the TiN–CdS NRAs: firstly, the visible light absorption of CdS and SPR effect of plasmonic TiN improve the light harvesting ability of the hybrid NRAs; secondly, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructure of CdS is favorable for the transport and separation of photoproduced charge carriers; thirdly, NRAs provide large surface to harvest light energy and also offer sufficient transport channels for building electrode/electrolyte interfaces effectively."
16,Conclusion,"In summary, nonmetal plasmonic TiN NPs have been employed for the first time to significantly boost PEC water splitting for direct hydrogen generation of CdS NRAs under visible light irradiation. The hybrid TiN–CdS NRAs loaded with the optimized TiN NPs demonstrate substantially boosted PEC water splitting performance and achieve a high photocurrent density of 2.9 mA cm−2 at 0 V versus Ag/AgCl. Most importantly, the hybrid NRAs achieve a high hydrogen generation rate of 101.5 μmol h−1 cm−2 under condition of without applying bias and the highest photoconversion efficiency of 2.2% at 0.22 V versus RHE, which are 2 and 1.6 times higher than that of the pristine CdS NRAs, respectively. The experimental measurements of the PL spectra evidently reveal that hot-electron injection from TiN to CdS plays a vital role for significantly boosting PEC water splitting performance of the hybrid TiN–CdS NRAs. This study provides valuable insight into coupling nonmetal plasmonic materials with suitable semiconductors for highly efficient solar energy conversion and may find potential applications in the fields of clean energy and solar cells."
