0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is receiving more and more attention as a clean and effective energy carrier for the future [1,2]. Biological hydrogen production which can be performed at normal temperature and pressure is a promising way for the future hydrogen economy [3,4]. Biohydrogen can be produced by fermentative bacteria including obligate and facultative anaerobes from renewable biomass [5–7]. However, lower hydrogen yield and process efficiency still limit the commercial application of biological hydrogen production. Among the fermentative hydrogen producers, Enterobacter aerogenes as a facultative anaerobe, is a promising bacterial strain due to its higher hydrogen evolution rate and uninhibited growth in an atmosphere of 100% H2 [8–10]. It also exhibits good growth characteristics during glucose fermentation [11]. By the aerobic growth and the exhaustion of residual oxygen in the reactor system, E. aerogenes can be expected to be a useful strain since it can allow the hydrogen production process to be easily manipulated to a strict anaerobic environment required for the hydrogen production [12,13]. However, even though many works have been carried out to enhance the hydrogen production mainly by optimizing the cultivation conditions of E. aerogenes [14,15], 1mol of glucose can always reportedly produce around 1.12–1.30mol of hydrogen in batch fermentations by E. aerogenes [9]. Therefore, to improve the hydrogen yield of E. aerogenes, the hydrogen-evolving pathway as well as the related hydrogenases and the regulation network should be elucidated and controlled. There are two routes contributing to hydrogen production by E. aerogenes, i.e., formate pathway and NADH pathway [8,12,16–18]. For the hydrogen production of facultative anaerobes, the formate pathway is generally of importance, since the formate produced from glucose by the anaerobic metabolism can always be quickly transformed to hydrogen by formate hydrogen lyase (FHL) [18,19]. Some studies indicated that addition of formate or formic acid could enhance the hydrogen productivity of E. aerogenes [12]. However, since FHL system in E. aerogenes is still unclear [19], the effect of regulating FHL complex on the hydrogen productivity remains unknown. In Escherichia coli, the FHL complex reportedly consists of formate dehydrogenase (FDH-H), hydrogenase, and electron transfer mediators. Transcription of the FHL complex is under the control of several genes, including fhlA and hycA, which code for the FHL activator protein FHLA and the FHL repressor protein HYCA, respectively [3]. The FHLA is a tetramer that binds to the upstream region of the gene encoding the FHL complex, and promotes the transcription of the FHL complex. The HYCA binds to FHLA and/or to the FHLA–formate complex. The FHLA–HYCA complex seems to repress the transcription of the FHL complex [3]. Therefore, in order to elucidate the hydrogen evolution mechanisms of E. aerogenes, it will be interesting to disturb the formate pathway of E. aerogenes by manipulating these genes related with the FHL complex and their regulation proteins. In our previous research, in order to understand the formate pathway of E. aerogenes for the hydrogen production, the genes encoding the formate hydrogen lyase repressor (hycA) and the small subunit of the uptake hydrogenase (hybO) were knocked out, using the pYM-Red recombination system [19]. The knockout of hycA or hybO improved the hydrogen yield and production rate. In this study, for further understanding the regulation of formate pathway in E. aerogenes, we constructed the expression system of the formate dehydrogenase FDH-H gene (fdhF) and FHL activator protein FHLA gene (fhlA) originated from E. coli. The perturbation of hydrogen production and fermentative metabolites was analyzed after overexpression of fdhF and fhlA in the wild strain of E. aerogenes IAM1183, the hycA-deleted mutant (E. aerogenes IAM1183-ΔhycA, A) and the hybO-deleted mutant (E. aerogenes IAM1183-ΔhybO, O)."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Strains and recombinant plasmids,"2.1 Strains and recombinant plasmids E. aerogenes IAM1183 purchased from the Institute of Applied Microorganisms (IAM) of the University of Tokyo, Japan, was used in this study. The mutants of E. aerogenes IAM1183-ΔhycA (A) and E. aerogenes IAM1183-ΔhybO (O) were constructed by Zhao et al. [19], which were created by the knockout of genes encoding the formate hydrogen lyase repressor (hycA) and the small subunit of the uptake hydrogenase (hybO), respectively. Table 1 and 2 showed the strains, plasmids, recombinant plasmids and primers used in this study. Because the strains of Ea, A and O were ampicillin resistant, ampicillin & kanamycin resistant and ampicillin & tetracycline resistant, respectively, so the ampicillin resistance in the pMAL-c2X plasmid was replaced by the chloramphenicol resistance from the pACYC184 plasmid, forming the pMCL plasmid which was used as the expression vector in this study and confirmed to be valid for E. aerogenes. The primers used for Amp deletion in pMAL-c2X and Cm replication from pACYC184 were P1F-R and P2F-R as shown in Table 2. The formate dehydrogenase FDH-H gene (fdhF) and FHL activator protein FHLA gene (fhlA) from E. coli were amplified with primers P3F-R and P4F-R (Table 2). The PCR fragments were cloned in the pMD-18T simple vector, then digested with restriction enzymes. The digested DNA fragments were inserted into the multiple cloning sites of the pMCL plasmid, forming the recombinant plasmid of pMCL-fdhF (Cm r) and pMCL-fhlA (Cm r). The recombinant pMCL-fdhF and pMCL-fhlA plasmids were transferred into E. aerogenes IAM1183 (Amp r), E. aerogenes IAM1183-ΔhycA (Km r) and E. aerogenes IAM1183-ΔhybO (Tet r), respectively, based on the protocol established by our group [16]. The empty plasmid pMCL was transferred into the respective strains which were used as the controls."
3,Culture conditions,"2.2 Culture conditions The culture medium (1l) consisted of glucose 15.0g, tryptone 5.0g, (NH4)2SO4 2.0g, KH2PO4 14.0g, K2HPO4·3H2O 6.0g and MgSO4 0.2g [12,17]. All chemicals used were of analytical grade. The glucose was sterilized individually by autoclave. The initial pH value of medium was controlled at 6.0 by the addition of NaOH or HCl. 20ml of medium was put into the serum bottle with 70ml of total volume. The serum bottle was sealed with butyl rubber stopper and degassed with 100% of aseptic nitrogen for 5min to make the anaerobic condition. The cultivation was performed at 37°C. When the bacterial cells cultivated in a 100ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 20ml medium reached 1.0 in terms of optical density at 600nm (OD600), 1ml of the culture as the inoculum was transferred into the serum bottle. The whole operation was done under the anaerobic condition. Since the pMCL-fdhF and pMCL-fhlA plasmids were driven by the lac promoter, the recombinant cells were induced by addition of 0.5mM of IPTG in the medium. The IPTG was added into the medium before the cultivation."
4,Assay of hydrogenase activity,"2.3 Assay of hydrogenase activity After 5h of induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in a buffer of 100mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). A cell free extract was prepared by ultrasonication. The hydrogenase was assayed spectrophotometrically by monitoring at 604nm the oxidization of methyl viologen (MV+) [20]. Anaerobic cuvettes were completely filled with 100mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), and MV+ was added (final concentration, 4mM). The buffer in the cuvette was titrated with sodium dithionite solution (10mM) before the addition of the enzyme. One unit of activity represented 1μmol of oxidized methyl viologen (MV2+) per min. The absorptivity of MV+ at 604nm was 13.9mM−1 cm−1 [20]."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The OD600 of the cells was measured by using an ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer (UV757CRT, Shanghai Precision & Scientific Instrument CO., Ltd., China). The dry cell weight was then calculated by the equation of dry cell weight (g/l)=0.132×OD600. The pH of the culture was measured by pH meter (MODEL 828, ORION, United States). Hydrogen was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC112A, Shanghai Precision & Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd., China) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 2m×3mm (i.d.) stainless-steel column packed with TDX-01 (80–100 mesh). The temperatures of injector, detector and column were kept at 120, 120, and 80°C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 10ml/min. The concentrations of individual organic acids and alcohols in metabolites were analyzed by a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Shimadzu 10A) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a Shimadzu SCR-102H column after pretreatment with a 0.45μm membrane filter. HClO4 of 5mM was used as a mobile phase at a flow rate of 1ml/min. The concentration of reducing sugar was measured by 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) colorimetry [21]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Culture characteristics of the different strains,"3.1 Culture characteristics of the different strains The fdhF and fhlA genes expressed in the wild strain of E. aerogenes and its mutants were driven by the lac promoter in pMCL plasmid, and induced by IPTG at the beginning of the cultivation. Specific hydrogenase activities in E. aerogenes IAM1183 (Ea), E. aerogenes IAM1183-ΔhycA (A) and E. aerogenes IAM1183-ΔhybO (O) with overexpression of fdhF and fhlA after 6h of cultivation were assayed as shown in Fig. 1 . Compared with the control strain (containing the blank plasmid), with fdhF overexpression, the specific hydrogenase activities of strains Ea, A and O were increased by 80.5%, 88.4% and 26.4%, respectively, and also with fdh1 overexpression, those were increased by 42.3%, 29.2% and 4.8%, respectively. These results demonstrated that fdhF and fhlA were overexpressed successfully in E. aerogenes and its mutants. Compared with fhlA, the fdhF overexpression showed higher hydrogenase activities in all of the strains. Overexpression of fdhF and fhlA showed obvious effects on the cell growth and glucose consumption for Ea, A and O (Fig. 2 ). In most cases, when the cells were in the growth phase (from 0 to 10h), with the overexpression of fdhF and fhlA, all the strains of Ea, A and O exhibited improved growth than the control did. After 15h of cultivation, Ea, A and O with fhlA overexpression showed higher final cell concentrations, compared with the respective control. The fhlA overexpression in the mutant A reached the maximum cell concentration of 0.233g/l (Fig. 2(b)). Ea, A and O with fdhF and fhlA overexpression exhibited different glucose consumptions within the growth phase (from 0 to 10h), compared with the respective control strain, leading to the different residual glucose concentrations after 15h of cultivation. As shown in Fig. 2(c), the strain O with the fhlA overexpression showed the largest glucose consumption."
8,Alteration of hydrogen production with overexpression of fdhF and fhlA,"3.2 Alteration of hydrogen production with overexpression of fdhF and fhlA Time course profiles of the hydrogen production per liter culture for these strains with and without expression of fdhF or fhlA were shown in Fig. 3 . In the hydrogen production phase (from 0 to 5h or 10h), overexpression of fdhF and fhlA in all of the strains enhanced the hydrogen production rates, compared with the respective control strain. After 15h of the cultivation, compared with the respective control strain, the increase of hydrogen production per liter culture by the wild strain Ea with fdhF overexpression was the highest (30.1%), while the hydrogen production for the mutants A and O with the fhlA overexpression showed the maximum increase of 24.4% and 3.6%, respectively. Although the maximum increase ratio of hydrogen production by the mutant O with fhlA expression was the lowest (3.6%), the final volumetric hydrogen productivity of the mutant O with fhlA overexpression was the highest (1.35 l/l culture), and increased by 62.9% compared with the wild strain Ea (0.83 l/l culture), which was due to the fact that the strain O by deletion of the uptake hydrogenase could improve the total hydrogen production [19]. The cell yield of the three strains with fdhF and fhlA overexpression showed different change trends after 15h of cultivation, compared with the respective control strains (Fig. 4(a)). With fdhF and fhlA overexpression, the cell yield for the mutant A increased compared with the control, but the mutant O decreased. Unlike mutants A and O, the fdhF and fhlA overexpression in the wild strain Ea decreased and increased the cell yield, respectively. The results of final cell yield demonstrated that the cellular glucose metabolism in these strains was probably changed differently by the fdhF and fhlA overexpression [22]. After 15h of cultivation, the overexpression of fdhF and fhlA improved hydrogen yield per gram CDW, as shown in Fig. 4(b). With fdhF overexpression, the hydrogen production per gram CDW by strains Ea, A and O was increased by 38.5%, 21.8% and 5.25%, respectively. The strain Ea with fdhF overexpression reached the maximum hydrogen yield of 0.281mol hydrogen per gram cell. Furthermore, Fig. 4(c) showed that the fdhF and fhlA overexpression improved the hydrogen yield per mol glucose consumed for strains Ea and A, but decreased the yield of the strain O. Even so, the total hydrogen yield of the mutant O without the expression of fdhF and fhlA was the highest among all the strains examined. These results suggested that in the different strains of E. aerogenes, expression of fdhF and fhlA could differently affect the hydrogen production. Formate pathway and NADH pathway are proved to be the two routes of hydrogen production in E. aerogenes [18,19]. Because fdhF and fhlA overexpression could disturb the expression of original FHL complex in E. aerogenes, which was considered to affect the formate pathway to alter the hydrogen production. However, the different results for the different strains with expression of fdhF and fhlA described above suggested that not only the formate pathway but also the NADH pathway might be affected by the introduction of the genes. Table 3 showed the total hydrogen yield and the hydrogen yields estimated from the formate and NADH pathways. The experimental results of the total hydrogen yield were equal to the sum of calculated hydrogen yields from the formate and NADH pathways, proving again that the two pathways contribute to the hydrogen production in E. aerogenes. As also shown in Table 3, compared with the respective control, the increase of the total hydrogen yield for the strain Ea with fdhF and fhlA overexpression was mainly attributed to the increase of hydrogen yield from the formate pathway (20.7% and 13.8%, respectively). The formate dehydrogenase FDH-H and FHL activator protein FHLA as the important components of FHL complex [3], whose overexpression in the wild strain might promote the hydrogen production by enhancing formate pathway to some extent. However, the situation for the mutants was different. For the mutant A with fdhF and fhlA overexpression, the improved total hydrogen yield was mainly attributed to the increase of hydrogen yield from the NADH pathway (20.8% and 38.3%, respectively). While the decrease of the total hydrogen yield of the mutant O with fdhF and fhlA overexpression was due to the decrease of the hydrogen yield from the formate pathway. These results suggested that the combination of the knockout of FHL repressor (hycA) and the expression of fdhF or fhlA could disturb the cellular metabolism, but the perturbation effects by fdhF or fhlA expression would be dependent on the strain self."
9,Perturbation of anaerobic metabolism by overexpression of fdhF and fhlA,"3.3 Perturbation of anaerobic metabolism by overexpression of fdhF and fhlA From Figs. 1–4 and Table 3, compared with the respective control, all the strains with fdhF or fhlA overexpression showed different changes in growth and hydrogen production. The anaerobic fermentation metabolites detected after the 15h of cultivation were listed in Table 4 , and lactate was the highest concentration among the metabolites. The metabolites of E. aerogenes are reportedly lactate, 2,3-butanediol, formate, ethanol, acetate and succinate [9], which were the same as measured in this study. However, with the overexpression of fdhF or fhlA, the lactate in all the strains decreased, suggesting that the lactate pathway played the most negative role in the hydrogen production. In all the cases, no formate was detected, showing that the formate formed was used quickly for the hydrogen production, which was the same as reported in our previous studies [18,19]. The cellular redox state is always believed to be an important parameter for hydrogen production [22]. As shown in Table 4, because of the lower 2,3-butanediol concentration, the increase of the ethanol production for these three strains of Ea, A and O with overexpression of fdhF or fhlA had important contributions to the more reduced states inside the cells, i.e., the excess of reducing power. The acetate was also an important metabolite for strains Ea, A and O. Except the mutant O, the strains Ea and A with the fdhF overexpression showed more acetate production per mol glucose. But for these three strains, the fhlA overexpression caused less acetate production. The acetate production pathway is closely related with the ATP regeneration [9], suggesting that overexpression of fdhF or fhlA in the different strains could also alter the energy metabolism. Table 4 also listed the ratio of ethanol-to-acetate (Et/Ac ratio) for all of the strains with and without expression of fdhF and fhlA. Although the hydrogen yield showed different alterations (Table 3), Et/Ac ratio of these three strains all increased by fdhF and fhlA overexpression. The hydrogen production reflects the overflow of the cellular reducing power. Under the anaerobic conditions, the more reduced environment was formed by fdhF and fhlA overexpression in all these strains, as evidenced by the increase in the Et/Ac ratio [23]. The increase of Et/Ac ratio reflected the more reducing power, improving the hydrogen production, as shown in Fig. 3. The fhlA overexpression in the strains formed higher Et/Ac ratio than the fdhF overexpression, which might promote the cellular metabolism, thereby improving the cell growth rate, glucose consumption rate and hydrogen volumetric production rate (Figs. 2 and 3). However, different from the increase of the hydrogen yield per mol glucose consumed by Ea and A with fdhF and fhlA overexpression, the hydrogen yield per mol consumed glucose of mutant O decreased. For the mutant O, with fdhF and fhlA overexpression, the increase ratio of hydrogen production per liter culture after 15h of cultivation (Fig. 3(c)) was smaller than that of the glucose consumption (Fig. 2(c)), which might cause the lower hydrogen yield per mol glucose consumed."
10,Conclusions,"The E. coli-originated formate dehydrogenase FDH-H and FHL activator protein FHLA were overexpressed in the wild (Ea) and the mutants with deletion of formate hydrogen lyase repressor (hycA) (A) and small subunit of the uptake hydrogenase (hybO) (O). We could thereby alter hydrogen production by the perturbation of formate pathway in E. aerogenes. 1) With fdhF and fhlA overexpression, the three strains grew faster than the respective control, but showed different effects on the cell yield. After 15h of cultivation, the hydrogen production per liter culture and hydrogen yield per gram DCW for Ea, A and O were improved, respectively. 2) The fdhF and fhlA overexpression improved the hydrogen yield per mol glucose consumed for strains Ea and A, but decreased that for strain O. The increase of hydrogen yield per mol glucose for the strain Ea was mainly attributed to the increase of formate pathway. However, the improvement of the total hydrogen yield for the mutant A was mainly attributed to the increase of NADH pathway. 3) Three main metabolites of lactate, ethanol and acetate exhibited different change trends for the strains with fdhF and fhlA overexpression, which accordingly affected the cellular redox state balance and energy level. And Et/Ac ratio of these three strains was increased to different extents, reflecting that more reducing power was formed and probably affected the hydrogen production."
