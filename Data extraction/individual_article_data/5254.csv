0,Introduction,"Anhydrous ethanol, as a green fuel, is of increasing practical significance in alleviating current energy shortage and reducing air pollution. Membrane separation techniques have attracted considerable attention owing to its potential applications in medication, energy, food and environmental protection. In particular, pervaporation separation technology is hopefully to be developed more widely in industry, especially in producing anhydrous ethanol; because it has lots of advantages within the separation process, such as requiring no introduction of a third component, simple equipments, high single-stage separation efficiency, no pollution and low energy consumption [1–9]. Tusel et al. [10] shows that the employment of a ethanol-producing technique, distillation–pervaporation membrane preparation method, in dehydrating ethanol from 95.57wt% to 99.85wt%, can bring a 28% and 40% decrease in investment and operating costs respectively, compared to the traditional azeotropic distillation method. In particular, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a very important material for the separation of water/ethanol solutions by prevaporation [11], because the PVA membrane shows excellent selectivity toward water and also has remarkable film-forming characteristics as well as good resistance to organic mixtures, despite of its poor stability in aqueous mixtures [12]. In addition, PVA membrane has many attractive advantages such as air-tightness property, biodegradability, nontoxicity, and good tensile, tear and impact properties, which make it a new generation of environment-benign materials. In recent years, studies concerning separation of water/ethanol mixture using other membranes abound. Uragami et al. [13] studied the separation factors and permeation rate of water/ethanol by organic–inorganic hybrid membranes composed of PVA and tetraethoxysilane with different tetraethoxysilane content. Yeom et al. [14] studied the performance of sodium alginate and PVA blend membranes on the pervaporation separation of the ethanol–water mixtures with the temperature range of 323–353K. Rhim et al. [15] investigated the effect of the crosslinking density of PVA membrane on the separation of water/ethanol mixtures. All these experimental studies have shown their interesting separation characteristics, but the separation mechanism of PVA membranes is still obscure due to the difficulties in identifying their microscopic structure by experiments. Whereas, molecular simulation can provide better understanding of the relationship between material structure and property and guide experiments to develop in a safer, more efficient and more economical way. Therefore, there are strong incentives for simulating at the molecular level. Zhang et al. [16] investigated the characteristics of swollen PVA and analyzed the intrinsic relationship between the microstructure of the swollen PVA and the diffusion of water and ethanol in PVA matrix using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, the composition and density of water and ethanol mixtures in membrane systems of some previous works was arbitrarily set, not determined from GCMC simulations, so the diffusion properties obtained from some previous works may not be reasonable, since the diffusion of small molecules in confined system is strongly dependent on concentration and composition. For mixture separation simulations [17–21], inorganic zeolites and carbon nanotubes are mostly adopted, while less attention is paid on polymeric systems. In addition, the effect of polymerization degree on the separation performance and the structure–property relationship of polymer membranes with different polymerization degrees are seldom investigated. We perform grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations to investigate the performance of PVA membrane in separating the azeotropic water/ethanol mixture (95.57wt% ethanol). In order to find the optimal operating conditions for producing anhydrous ethanol, we discuss the influence of different factors such as temperature, pressure and polymerization degree of PVA. Our discussion and explanation are mainly at the microscopic level, using not only the traditional FFV method but also the new hydrogen bond analysis. Our findings may also provide guidance to related experiments, and help to understand more profoundly the feasibility of industrially applying polymeric membrane to the separation of water/ethanol mixture."
1,Simulation methods and details,
2,Simulation methods,"2.1 Simulation methods GCMC simulation method is often used to study the adsorption of fluids. It is especially suitable for simulations of mixtures and inhomogeneous systems, such as fluids at interfaces and micropores. In the adsorption process, chemical potential is converted into partial fugacity of each component. Thus, in GCMC simulation, fugacity is also closely related to chemical potential. The equilibrium in GCMC simulation arrives when temperature and chemical potential of the fluids within the system are respectively equal to those of the macro fluids. GCMC deals with open systems where the chemical potential, volume and temperature are fixed (i.e. constant μ, V, T ensemble). It should be noted that these parameters are also constant in the experimental measurements of adsorption process, which facilitates direct comparisons between simulation and experimental results [22]."
3,Simulation details,"2.2 Simulation details Molecular simulations were carried out using the Forcite module, Amorphous Cell, and Sorption modules of Materials Studio 4.4 (Accelrys Software Inc). The COMPASS force field was used to simulate the sorption behavior of PVA. Electrostatic interactions were treated with Ewald method [23]; while van der Waals interactions were calculated by the atom-based option [24] with the non-bonded cutoff distance of 1.0nm. The Metropolis method [25] was employed to accept or reject configurational moves (rotation and translation of the sorbate molecules) as well as for sorbate insertion and deletion, in which the trial configurations were generated without bias and the adsorbate structure was treated as rigid. The initial PVA chain was consisted of 100–1000 repeat units. For PVA control membrane, the packing model with an initial density of 0.9g/cm3 was constructed. Periodic boundary conditions were applied to the cubic simulation cells. The initial constructed structures were subsequently optimized by a 5000-step energy minimization to eliminate the unreasonable contact and by an annealing procedure. During the annealing, systems were heated from 298 to 498K at an interval of 20K and then cooled back at an interval of 20K, with temperature being controlled by Andersen [26]. At each temperature interval, 100-ps NPT dynamics was performed. At each desired temperature, a further 5-ns NPT-MD simulation was undertaken. Four configurations at 0, 1, 3 and 5ns were used for GCMC simulations. Afterwards, GCMC simulations were performed, with 5×106 steps for equilibration and 2×107 steps for production. The uncertainty was determined by averaging the results from these four simulations. In addition, in order to testify the accuracy of the used force field and the reliability of PVA membrane, the specific volume of the PVA membrane with a polymerization degree of 150 was analyzed under 101.325kPa and 298–410K. Fig. 1 is the profile showing the relationship between temperature and specific volume of PVA membrane, where an inflexion point exists. Linear fittings are done to both sides of the inflexion point. From the intersection of the two lines, we can read the glass transition temperature (T g) of the PVA. The simulated T g is 354.32K, very close to the experimental value of 349.25K [27], which demonstrates that the PVA constructed in simulation is adequate to represent the realistic PVA membrane and the used COMPASS force field is suitable."
4,Results and discussions,
5,Temperature effect,"3.1 Temperature effect Temperature is always one of the necessary factors to be considered for an adsorption separation process. Non-crystalline solids, known as “amorphous materials”, do not have their atoms or molecules arranged on a lattice periodically repeated in space. For all amorphous solids, whether glasses, organic polymers or even metals, T g is the critical temperature that separates their glassy and rubbery behaviors. “Glassy” in this context means hard and brittle, while “rubbery” means elastic and flexible. A glass is defined as a material that has no long-range atomic or molecular order and that is below the temperature at which a rearrangement of its atoms or molecules can occur. A rubber is a non-crystalline solid whose atoms or molecules can undergo rearrangement. In other words, if a material is at a temperature below its T g, large-scale molecular motion is impossible because the material is essentially frozen. If it is at a temperature above its T g, molecular motion on the scale of its repeat unit takes place, allowing it to be “soft” or “rubbery”. The maximum operating temperature chosen cannot exceed the T g of PVA membrane, which is 349.25K [27]. Since the pervaporation separation process in itself should be an energy-saving process, too low operating temperature is not recommended. Therefore, the temperature range in the simulation is between room temperature of 298K and the below-T g of 338K. Fig. 2 shows the simulation results of water and ethanol mixture separation in a PVA membrane with a polymerization degree of 150 at different temperatures. At low temperatures, the adsorption of ethanol shows weak relation with the temperature, probably because the adsorption amount is too small. At high temperatures, both the adsorption amount of water and the total separation factors are low. This is because the adsorption is a spontaneously exothermic process, which will be hindered by higher temperature according to the Le Chatelier's Principle. Another explanation is that as the temperature increases, the thermal motion of polymer chain is intensified, which eventually increases the free volume of the membrane. In terms of Fox and Flory's free volume theory [28] and Connolly surface method [29], the FFV of PVA membrane at 298, 318, 338K is calculated to be 12.5%, 12.9%, 13.6%, respectively. The increase in free volume can in itself increases the adsorption amount of both ethanol and water. However, the increasing temperature also increases the kinetic energy of small molecules (like H2O and EtOH), making them move too fast to be captured and adsorbed by polymers. This tendency actually counteracts or even surpasses the effect of increase in free volume. Accordingly, adsorbate molecules are more inclined to desorb instead of being adsorbed. In this case, the total permeation flux within the PVA membrane also increases, agreeing well with Peng's research [30]. Finally, among the chosen temperature range, the separation factor reaches its peak at 298K (see Fig. 2b). This means 298K is the most suitable temperature for the separation of water/ethanol mixture. The following simulations are undertaken at this temperature. Moreover, PVA membrane has a separation factor of 25.9 by simulation at 298K, which is very close to the experimental data of 28.1 [31] for 95wt% ethanol, indicating that our simulation is reasonable."
6,Polymerization degree effect,"3.2 Polymerization degree effect Polymerization degree is an important parameter in selecting PVA products. A specific PVA product can have a product category of about 30 merely according to its polymerization degree [32]. PVA products with a polymerization degree of 1750±50 are used mostly as spinning raw material or in paper industry. PVA products with lower polymerization degree are more suitable for making pulp, while those with higher polymerization degree mixed with partial alcoholysis PVA can be used as adhesives, protective colloid and dispersant. In general, PVA has strong adhesion and moisture resistance. The polymerization degree can have significant influence on the performance of a PVA product by changing its viscosity. With the decrease of the polymerization degree, the viscosity of PVA membrane declines and the separation performance changes accordingly. PVA membranes with polymerization degree of 100–1000 are selected in our simulations. The water/ethanol mixture to be separated is azeotropic, i.e. 95.57wt% ethanol. Fig. 3 depicts the influence of the polymerization degree on the adsorption amount, which is somewhat complicated. At lower polymerization degree, the adsorption amount of either ethanol or water increases as polymerization degree increases, which is in accordance with Tao's [33] and Lyulin's [34] results. However at higher polymerization degree, the adsorption amount begins to decrease (see Fig. 5a). In addition, as polymerization degree increases, the separation factor decreases first and then increases (see Figs. 4 and 5b ). Explanations are given below. The first analysis is based primarily on free volume theory. Firstly, we discuss the effect of annealing before GCMC simulations. According to the Connolly Surface method, the FFV of different PVA membranes decreases to a certain degree after annealing by MD simulation. As we know, the thermal motion of polymer is a relaxation process [35]. That is, the process of polymer transferring from one equilibrium state through thermal motion to the other equilibrium state adapted to ambience is not instant but requires some time. The decrease in free volume suggests a relaxation of the PVA membrane after annealing, which leads to a change in its density closer to the real state. Secondly, we discuss the adsorption of ethanol and water in terms free volume theory. The green part in Fig. 6 stands for the free volume before adsorption of the PVA membrane annealed (polymerization degree, 300). Fig. 7 shows the relation between the FFV and degrees of polymerization. It can be observed that as the polymerization degree goes up, the FFV first increases and then decreases, which is supposed to be responsible for the above-mentioned change in adsorption amount of ethanol and water. However, further comparison of these two similar ways of change shows that the inflexion points are different. The one in Fig. 5a occurs with polymerization degree being 500–800, while the one in Fig. 7 occurs with lower polymerization degree, 200–400. So, there must be at least one more factor that plays a positive role in increasing the adsorption amount when the polymerization degree increases; and hydrogen bond is supposed to be this factor. The second analysis is from the theory of hydrogen bonding. Fig. 8a shows the initial configuration of the PVA membrane, it can be seen that parts of hydroxyl groups have already formed hydrogen bonds, the amount of which is increased by an increasing polymerization degree or chain length. Fig. 8b shows the configuration of PVA membrane after adsorption of ethanol and water, it can be observed that there is a substantial increase in the number of hydrogen bonds, indicating a close relationship between hydrogen bonds and the adsorption behavior in the membrane. Fig. 8c shows a picture where the PVA chain is omitted for clarity. We find that almost each molecule being adsorbed involves in the formation of hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bonds may be formed within adsorbate molecules, or between adsorbate molecules and the hydroxyl groups of the adsorbents. We also find that the absolute energy of hydrogen bond between PVA and adsorbed molecules increases when polymerization degree of PVA goes up (see Fig. 9 ). As the molecule of PVA grows bigger with the increase of polymerization degree, its space structure becomes more and more complex. As a result, more and more groups will join to form the intra-molecular hydrogen bonds, making the hydrogen bond energy increase. The increase in energy of hydrogen bond by bringing a corresponding increase in energy of adsorption and also in stability of adsorption plays an important role in the adsorption of ethanol and water. In addition, ethanol molecules compared with water molecule have a stronger tendency in forming hydrogen bonds; the energy of hydrogen bond of ethanol and water is 25kJ/mol and 18.83kJ/mol respectively [36]. As we know, alkyl within the ethanol molecule indeed increases the ability of oxygen as an electron acceptor, so when the oxygen in an ethanol molecule accepts more electrons than that in a water molecule, its hydrogen nuclei must be more exposed. Thus the hydrogen atom in the hydroxyl of ethanol can form a hydrogen bond more easily [37]. In other words, the adsorption amount of ethanol will increase faster than that of water when the PVA's ability in hydrogen bond increases with the increase of polymerization degree. Therefore when the adsorption amount of both ethanol and water increases with the increase of polymerization degree, the separation factor on the contrary decreases to some extent [38]. In combination of the FFV analysis and the hydrogen bond analysis, we further deduce that the fact that adsorption amount first increases and then decreases with the increase of polymerization degree results from a transition from cooperation to competition between FFV and hydrogen bond. The cooperation and competition effects can be seen synchronously and directly from Fig. 10 . It can be seen that when the polymerization degree is lower than 200, FFV is cooperating with hydrogen bond. Both increases play a positive role in the increase of adsorption amount. But when the polymerization degree increases from 200 to 500 (for ethanol) or to 800 (for water), FFV decreases, which results in a corresponding decrease in adsorption amount; at the same time, hydrogen bond goes on increasing, resulting in a sustaining increase in adsorption amount. What's more, this increase is capable of counteracting and even surpassing the decrease brought by the negative effect of a decreasing FFV. In other words, hydrogen bond compared to FFV preponderates in their competition in this range of polymerization degrees, making the adsorption amount eventually increases with the increase of polymerization degree. Finally, as the polymerization degree goes on increasing, the positive effect of hydrogen bond becomes weaker and thus is surpassed by FFV. It means that FFV dominates in this range of polymerization degrees and eventually makes the adsorption amount decrease."
7,Pressure effect,"3.3 Pressure effect The effects of pressure on the separation performance of PVA membrane are summarized. As the pressure goes up, the adsorption amount of ethanol decreases while the adsorption amount of water and the separation factor increases (see Figs. 2, 3 and 4). Although the pressure does not influence the fugacities of fluids such as water and ethanol within the mixture, it affects the relaxation of the PVA membrane and the adsorption process. Our findings show that higher pressure is favorable for separation; but it is not recommended due to the consideration of the energy conservation issue. In our study, the separation factor is about 80 by the PVA membrane with polymerization degree of 1000 under room temperature and atmospheric pressure, which can ensure the concentration of ethanol being improved from 95.57wt% to 99.96wt%. In other words, anhydrous alcohol could be obtained through this way."
8,Conclusions,"In this work, GCMC simulations are employed to study the separation of water/ethanol mixture by PVA membrane. PVA membrane is first annealed by MD simulations, during which the membrane is relaxed and its density changes closer to real state. Then GCMC method is used to simulate the adsorption process. Factors such as temperature, pressure and polymerization degree are studied. As the temperature goes up, the separation factor of PVA membrane and the adsorption amount of ethanol or water decreases. Therefore, room temperature is the optimal temperature for the separation. As the pressure increases, the adsorption amount of ethanol decreases, while the adsorption amount of water and the separation factor increases. High pressure is favorable for separation. However, due to the consideration of energy cost, atmospheric pressure is more preferable. As polymerization degree increases, the adsorption amount of ethanol or water first increases and then decreases, whereas the separation factor first decreases and then increases. Fraction of free volume and hydrogen bond are analyzed to explain the effect of polymerization degree on separation performance. It is found that the changing trend of adsorption amount results from a transition from cooperation to competition between FFV and hydrogen bond, and that hydrogen bond is the major factor at lower polymerization degrees, while free volume is more dominant at higher polymerization degrees. Finally, we conclude that under room temperature of 298K and atmospheric pressure of 101.325kPa, separation factor of the PVA membrane with polymerization degree of 1000 is about 80, which can ensure the concentration of ethanol reaching 99.96wt%. Therefore anhydrous alcohol could be obtained."
