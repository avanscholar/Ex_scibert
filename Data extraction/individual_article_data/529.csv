0,Introduction,"Upcycling of waste plastics into high-value-added products has been attractive in recent years. Waste plastics are non-biodegradable and composed mainly of hydrogen and carbon [1–4]. Thus, hydrogen and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) production from waste plastics instead of fossil fuels appears to be favorable as it subdues the environmental impact resulting from the non-renewable resources over-exploitation [5,6]. The co-production of CNTs and hydrogen from waste plastics can not only manage waste plastic disposal, but it can also generate high-value products for sustainability. Wu et al. [1] has successfully converted real-world waste plastics through pyrolysis-reforming to produce CNTs and hydrogen with the addition of the Ni–Mn–Al catalyst. Their results indicated that little polyvinyl chloride (PVC) content in the waste high-density polyethylene (HDPE) would poison the catalyst and affect the CNTs properties. Additionally, Yao et al. [2] used a Ni–Fe bimetallic catalyst for producing high-value CNTs with hydrogen from waste plastics pyrolysis. From these studies, the most promising method for upcycling waste plastics are thermo-chemical including gasification, pyrolysis, and carbonization [1,7–9]. Pyrolysis and gasification are the most effective thermo-chemical methods for upcycling waste plastics into high-value CNTs and hydrogen. In order to continuously operate the conversion of waste plastics into CNTs and hydrogen, it is important to choose the proper reactor to achieve the pilot-scale production. For enhancing the conversion efficiency of plastics into CNTs and hydrogen, the catalytic reaction is necessary. The most common reactor for the catalytic reforming of hydrocarbons to produce hydrogen is the fixed-bed type, while the current technology for industrial-scale production of CNTs from hydrocarbons is the catalytic chemical vapor deposition [3,7,10,11]. Compared to the fluidized-bed reactor, the fixed-bed reactor has some disadvantages including poor uniformity of temperature and discontinuous operation [12,13]. Contrarily, the fluidized-bed reactor is a heterogeneous gas-solid phase reactor with high heating transfer efficiency, high turbulence, and efficient mixing; it could be employed in a continuous feed operation for the future pilot-scale application [14–16]. However, one of the major drawbacks of the fluidized-bed reactor is that the bed materials/particles are subject to attrition and elutriation caused by bed-to-wall impacts and interparticle collisions during the fluidization [17]. The catalysts or additives adopted in the fluidized bed require the properties of high thermal stability, sufficient mechanical strength, and attrition resistance [18,19]. However, most synthesized catalysts are poor mechanical-resistance powders that cannot be directly utilized in the fluidized-bed reactor. The synthesized powder-type catalysts need to be granulated into suitable particle size and further upgraded to increase the mechanical resistance to attrition. Wang and Lin synthesized CuO/γ-Al2O3 sorbent by a sol-gel oil-drop granulation method and the CuO prepared by the sol-gel method exhibited greater mechanical strength than that of the preparation by the wet-impregnation method [20]. Most of the sorbents or catalyst supports synthesized by the sol-gel method are in the millimetric level; additional processes such as crushing and sieving are needed to obtain smaller particles [20–22]. Kim et al. used polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as an organic binder and sepiolite as an inorganic binder to synthesize mesoporous SBA-15. PVA is an inexpensive and green binder applied in resins and polymers, while sepiolite is a natural clay with a high specific surface area commonly used for granulation. The results indicated that adding these two binders in the synthesis procedure could preserve the original pore structure [23]. Regarding the catalyst introduced in waste plastics gasification, the process efficiency of simultaneous production of CNTs and hydrogen is a key factor which can be enhanced by the gasification system design. A two-stage process has been proposed to produce high yield carbon nanomaterials and hydrogen from plastics gasification/pyrolysis [1–3,24,25]. Williams and his group developed a two-stage pyrolysis-gasification system in plastics pyrolysis followed by catalytic steam gasification of the pyrolysis-produced gases for CNTs and hydrogen production [2,25]. Liu et al. applied a two-stage process to convert polypropylene (PP) into multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) and hydrogen. A screw kiln reactor was first to degrade PP into hydrocarbon mixtures. Then, a subsequent, tunable moving bed reactor was used for a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process to produce MWCNTs and hydrogen-rich gas [24]. Both the first- and second-reactor could have the operating parameters adjusted to fit the desired reactions. In our previous studies, we have synthesized Ni–Cu/CaO–SiO2 and Ni/Al-SBA-15 for hydrogen and CNTs production, respectively [26,27]. However, the catalysts were restricted to use in the fixed-bed reactor for the upgrading of CNTs and hydrogen production, resulting in the limited prior scale-up application. To develop a gasification system with the co-benefits of recycling waste plastics and simultaneous CNTs and hydrogen production, we built a two-stage fluidized-bed reactor system with the addition of Ni/Al-SBA-15 and Ni–Cu/CaO–SiO2 catalysts to enhance the activity. As shown in Fig. 1 , the waste plastics were continuously fed into the system, gasified into light hydrocarbons, and catalyzed by the Ni/Al-SBA-15 to form CNTs in the first-stage fluidized-bed. The remaining liquid, gaseous, and other solid heavy hydrocarbons were flowed into the second-stage fluidized-bed and upgraded by Ni–Cu/CaO–SiO2 to produce hydrogen. With this process, we have utilized the two-stage fluidized-bed gasification system for upcycling waste plastics into CNTs and hydrogen. To complete the two-stage fluidized-bed gasification system for co-production of CNTs and hydrogen from waste plastics, the effects of the fluidized-bed catalytic operating parameters (temperature and equivalence ratio) were investigated in this study. The gaseous products composition and the CNTs and hydrogen production activity were examined via several physical and spectroscopic characterization techniques."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Catalysts and artificial wastes preparation,"2.1 Catalysts and artificial wastes preparation 2.1.1 Preparation of Ni/Al-SBA-15 Ni/Al-SBA-15 and Ni–Cu/CaO–SiO2 catalysts were used for CNTs synthesis and hydrogen production, respectively. The Al-SBA-15 support was synthesized via a hydrothermal method with a two-step pH-adjusting procedure demonstrated and described in our previous work [27]. The as-synthesized Al-SBA-15 supports were powder-type particles. Powder-type Al-SBA-15 support needed to be further granulation for applying in the fluidized-bed. Al-SBA-15 was directly mixed with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, Aldrich, Mw∼31,000) and sepiolite (Aldrich) in the composition of (1:0.1:0.1), by mass [23,28,29]. A dough-like consistency mixture was prepared by adding minimum amount of water. After stirring at 60 °C in an oil bath until all of the liquid evaporated, the solid sample was crushed into fine powder. A 0.5 g sample of this powder was then tableted by a hydraulic power press delivering a pressure of 8000 psi with continuous vacuuming for 3 min to a diameter of 13 mm. Then, the tablets were calcined at 500 °C for 3 h. Finally, the tablets were crushing and sieving to the desired mean size (463 μm). The powder- and particle-type Al-SBA-15 support was denoted as Al-SBA-15-PD and Al-SBA-15-PL, respectively. After the support granulation, Ni was loaded on the Al-SBA-15-PL via the polyol process [27,30]. Ethylene glycol (EG, Sigma-Aldrich) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, average molecular weight = 10,000, Sigma-Aldrich) were used respectively as the reducing agent and the metal-protecting agent. A pre-calculated amount of Al-SBA-15-PL was added to an EG-PVP-nickel precursor solution (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Ni loading = 10 wt%) in a three-necked flask and agitated with a magnetic stirrer. The resulting suspension was heated to 190 °C and maintained at that temperature for 30 min. Then, the catalyst was filtered, washed, and dried. Consequently, the obtained Ni/Al-SBA-15-PL catalysts were calcined at 500 °C under a reduction atmosphere (5% H2/He) for 3 h. 2.1.2 Preparation of Ni–Cu/CaO–SiO2 CaO–SiO2 support was synthesized via a sol–gel method [19,26]. The detailed procedure of CaO–SiO2 was described by Yang et al. [26]. Due to the application in the fluidized bed, the obtained CaO–SiO2 support also needed to be granulated by the same granulation procedure of Al-SBA-15. The powder- and particle-type CaO–SiO2 support was designated as CaO–SiO2-PD and CaO–SiO2-PL, respectively. Ni and Cu were further loaded on the CaO–SiO2-PL support through a modified polyol process which has been modified and proposed by previous works [26,31]. A weighed amount of CaO–SiO2-PL was added to an EG-PVP-nickel-copper precursor solution (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Cu(NO3)·2.5H2O) in a three-necked flask. Then, the pH of the solution was adjusted to about 13 by 1 M NaOH, followed by stirring and purging with Ar. The suspension was heated to 160 °C and kept at that temperature for 4 h. Then, the solution was cooled and maintained at 90 °C for 24 h. The catalyst was filtered, washed, and dried. Finally, the obtained catalyst was calcined at 300 °C for 4 h under air. 2.1.3 Preparation of artificial waste The simulated artificial plastic waste included PP (3.0 g) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE, 0.3 g) were used in the gasification experiments. PP (2–3 mm virgin pellets) was acquired from Formosa Chemicals and Fibre Corporation and contained in a LDPE bag. The detailed information on the proximate and ultimate elemental analyses are referred from our previous work [27]."
3,Experimental apparatus and procedure,"2.2 Experimental apparatus and procedure 2.2.1 Experimental apparatus A sketch of the two-stage gasification system setup is presented in Fig. 2 . The reactor was made of two gasifier chambers. The height of the first gasifier chamber was 670 mm, while the second gasifier was 1400 mm. The chambers were all made of stainless steel (3 mm thickness, AISI 316SS) with an inner diameter of 60 mm and enclosed by an electrically resistant material packed with 1 in. ceramic fibers. The stainless steel porous plates were individually equipped in the bottom of the first and second gasifier chambers as a gas distributor. The open area of the first distributor was 15%, and the open area of the second was 18.2%. The temperature of the free board chamber and the sand bed was determined by the K-type thermocouple and controlled by a temperature indicator controller (TIC). The pressure detectors were installed on the bottom and free board of each chamber to detect the pressure difference between the sand bed and the free board chamber. Input air was provided by the blower at normal temperature and pressure conditions and was used as the gasifying agent. The equivalence ratio was determined by the in-flow air and defined as the actual input airflow relative to the stoichiometric complete combustion airflow. Silica sand (ρ p = 2600 kg/m3; Si, 94.88%; Al, 1.62%; K, 1.62%; Ca, 1.66%; and Fe, 0.22%) was used as the fluidized media. The particle size and the weight of the fluidized media were 463 μm and 330 g, respectively, at the first stage gasifier chamber, whereas those of the second stage were 545 μm and 330 g. 2.2.2 Experimental procedure The operating parameters employed such as the blank experiment, the temperature of the first- and second-stage, and the ERs, are presented in Table 1 . The catalyst was applied partially mixed with the silica sand (silica sand: catalyst = 32:1). The Ni/Al-SBA-15-PL catalyst was used in the first-stage reactor, while the Ni–Cu/CaO–SiO2-PL catalyst was used in the second-stage reactor. Initially, air was flowed into the first-stage reactor at a fixed flow rate by a blower, and its velocity was determined by the flow meter. When the system detected the approximate target temperature, the feedstock materials were continuously fed into the reactor through a hopper at a feeding rate of 19.8 g/min. The waste plastics were heated, dried, vaporized, and subsequently generated solid, liquid, and gaseous products. The solid product fraction was kept in the fluidized bed, while others were collected by the cyclone. During the gasification process, all the stainless steel tube were heated by the heater or the heating tape to prevent the gasification vapors from condensing. Furthermore, the gaseous products (H2, CH4, CO, CO2, and C2–C5 light hydrocarbons) in both of the two-stage reactor gas streams were sampled at the first and second sampling points. After feeding the feedstock for 10 min to reach the system stability, the gaseous products were collected by the sampling bags and further analyzed using the gas chromatography (GC). Each test was completed in 40 min. The concentration of H2, CH4, CO, and CO2 was obtained by using a GC (GC/TCD, Clarus 500 GC and Carboxen 1000 column, PerkinElmer), and that of the C2–C5 light hydrocarbons was determined using a GC equipped with a flame ionization detector [GC/FID, 6890N with alumina sulfate PLOT capillary column (50 m × 0.53 mm I.D.), Agilent]. For ensuring reliability and reproducibility, the two-stage gasification system for stability was performed in triplicate. Because the mixed plastic feedstock using in this study contains no nitrogen, the gas yield can be determined by the material balance of nitrogen [32]. The gas yield, H2 yield, and H2 production rate were calculated as following Eqs. (1)–(3), where N2 conc. denotes the concentration of N2 + CnHm, H2 conc. denotes the concentration of H2, and Mcata. is the mass of the catalyst before the reaction: (1) G a s y i e l d ( m 3 / k g p l a s t i c ) = g a s f l o w r a t e × 0.79 p l a s t i c f e e d i n g r a t e × N 2 c o n c . (2) H 2 y i e l d ( m 3 / k g p l a s t i c ) = H 2 c o n c . × g a s f l o w r a t e p l a s t i c f e e d i n g r a t e (3) H 2 p r o d u c t i o n r a t e ( m m o l / h − g c a t a l y s t ) = H 2 c o n c . × g a s f l o w r a t e M c a t a ."
4,Characterization of catalysts and products,"2.3 Characterization of catalysts and products The as-synthesized supports, catalysts, and carbon products were characterized via several different analytical techniques. The specific surface area (SBET) and pore parameters of the supports and catalysts were measured by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller sorptometer (BET-201-AEL, Porous Materials, Inc.). The crystal structure of the powder- and particle-type supports was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, BRUKER D8 SSS). The diffraction measurements of the Al-SBA-15 supports were carried out with a scanning step of 0.01° in the 2θ range of 0.5–4°, and that of the CaO–SiO2 supports were measured with that of 0.02°/s in the 2θ range of 10–90°. The morphology of the supports and the producing solid products from the waste plastic gasification process was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-1200CX II, JEOL) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM6700F, JEOL). The thermal properties of the solid products were analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, STA 6000, PerkinElmer). The sample (∼20 mg) was placed in a platinum specimen holder under air flow (20 mL/min) at with heating rate of 20 °C/min up to 850 °C and was held at 850 °C for 10 min."
5,Results and discussion,"The BET, XRD, and TEM were first used to characterize the physicochemical properties difference between the granulated supports and catalysts. Then, the two-stage fluidized-bed gasification system was used to upcycle waste plastics into CNTs and hydrogen, and the operating parameters (reaction temperature and equivalence ratio) of the gasification system were evaluated in this study."
6,Characterization of supports and catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of supports and catalysts The physical properties of the powder- and particle-type supports and as-prepared catalysts are included in Table 2 . The surface area of the Al-SBA-15-PL decreased from 279.5 to 237.2 m2/g after the granulation process. The pore volume of the Al-SBA-15-PL also decreased. One possible reason was that the surface area of the as-synthesized Al-SBA-15 was diluted by the binder addition [28]. However, the surface area of CaO–SiO2-PL increased from 206.4 to 244.0 m2/g with the granulation. The pore diameter of the CaO–SiO2-PL was remarkably reduced (226.0–72.6 Å) because the original sepiolite stick-shaped structure covered the powder-type CaO–SiO2 pores and resulted in greater the surface area. In comparison to the CaO–SiO2-PL support, the Ni and Cu active sites blocked the catalyst pores, resulting in less surface area, pore diameter, and pore volume for the Ni–Cu/CaO–SiO2-PL catalysts. XRD was used to determine the difference of structural properties between the powder- and particle-type supports, Fig. 3 presents the low-angle XRD patterns of both types. It was observed that the peak intensity of the Al-SBA-15-PL and CaO–SiO2-PL decreased. The results could be ascribed to two possible causes. One is that the sepiolite binders added in the granulation process were not been removed during the calcination. The residue binders could have not only covered the pores of the support but also reduced the peak intensity. The other possible cause is that tableting by a hydraulic power press damaged the crystalline structure of the support itself. After the granulation of the Al-SBA-15 support, the peak intensity of typical hexagonal porous structure of SBA-15 decreased (Fig. 3(a)) [33,34]. Other previous works also had similar results [28,35]. Saini et al. used montmorillite clay as the binder for the MCM-41 extrusion, and the XRD results indicated that the extrudate did not exhibit the original ordered structure of MCM-41 [28]. In Fig. 3(b), the crystalline peak is identified as the rhombohedral CaCO3 [36], and the peak intensity of CaO–SiO2-PL was lower than that of CaO–SiO2-PD. However, the main structure of rhombohedral CaCO3 still existed after the granulation, and this result indicated the granulation of CaO–SiO2 did not compromise the original structure. To clarify the structure of the support granulation and the reasons for pore structure change, TEM was used to observe the pore structure, and the results are presented in Fig. 4 . As shown in Fig. 4(a), the Al-SBA-15-PL possessed the two-dimensional hexagonal structure of SBA-15. Small parts of pore structure were covered by the rod-shaped sepiolite, and the mean size of the mesoporous hexagonal pores was about 8.3 nm. Fig. 4(b) also shows that few rod-shaped sepiolite crystals mixed with CaO–SiO2, which was in accordance with BET and XRD results."
7,Effect of the reaction temperature of first-stage fluidized-bed,"3.2 Effect of the reaction temperature of first-stage fluidized-bed The effect of the reaction temperature of the first-stage fluidized-bed was investigated first. In this part of the research, the fluidized media of the first-stage reactor was composed of 10 g of Ni/Al-SBA-15-PL and 320 g of silica sand, and the fluidized media of the second-stage reactor was made only of silica sand. The experiments were conducted at 500, 600, and 700 °C of the first-stage reactor, while the second-stage was fixed at 800 °C. Table 3 shows the gaseous composition, gas yield, H2 yield, and H2 production rate of the first- and second-sampling points at 500, 600, and 700 °C of the first-stage reactor and an ER of 0.1 with the second-stage reactor of 800 °C. The concentration of H2 at the first-sampling point increased with the first-stage fluidized catalyst bed temperature increased. When the reaction temperature was increased from 500 to 600 °C, the CO, CO2, and CH4 increased. After increasing the temperature to 700 °C, the CO2 concentration decreased from 2.36 to 1.42 mol% and the H2 concentration increased from 4.10 to 5.06 mol%. The decrease of CO2 and slightly increase of H2 might be ascribed to the higher reaction temperature leading to the inhibition of the water−gas shift reaction. The gasified products were further flowed into second-stage reactor at 800 °C. The gaseous composition from the first-stage to the second-stage at different reaction temperatures is shown as 2nd sampling point in Table 3. The gasified products from the first-stage catalytic reactor, such as tar and char, were upgraded to promote the concentration of H2, CO2, CO, CH4, and C2–C5 hydrocarbons by steam reforming, dry reforming, and a pyrolysis reaction in the second-stage reactor [37–39]. Additionally, as shown in Table 3, the other products (N2 + CnHm) decreased after the second-stage reactor, indicating heavy hydrocarbons (tar and char) might be decomposed by steam reforming, dry reforming, and the pyrolysis reaction. The rising temperature of the second-stage reactor contributed to the tar reforming and cracking reactions (Eqs. (4)–(6)), thereby increasing the H2, CO, and gas yield. Meanwhile, the second-stage reactor offered a heated environment and extended the residence time of the products. The producing tar from the first-stage reactor was reformed in the second-stage reactor, thus resulting in more gas yield. Previous studies have used a two-stage fluidized-bed system to improve biomass gasification efficiency and obtained similar results [16,40]. The tar reforming and cracking reactions are summarized as follows [41]: (4) T a r + n 1 H 2 O ↔ n 2 C O 2 + n 3 H 2 Δ H > 0 (5) C n H m ( T a r ) + n C O 2 ↔ ( m / 2 ) H 2 + 2 n C O Δ H > 0 (6) C n H m ( T a r ) ↔ ( m / 2 ) H 2 + n C Δ H > 0 The solid products from the waste plastics gasification of the two-stage fluidized-bed system and the bed materials were collected. As shown in Fig. 5 , both of the solid products, after the waste plastics gasification in the first- and second-stage reactor, the amount was increased. When the reaction temperature of the first-stage reactor was controlled at 600 °C, more solid phase was obtained in the two-stage fluidized-bed gasification system. The amount of solid phase decreased with increasing the temperature from 600 to 700 °C. This decrease can be attributed to the reforming and decomposition of solid phase products that were transferred into gaseous products. The physicochemical properties of the solid phase products from the two-stage fluidized-bed gasification system were analyzed by TEM, FESEM, and TGA. The TEM and FESEM images shown in Fig. 6 indicates that most of the solid phase products obtained from the first- and second-stage reactor were hollow structure CNTs. Fig. 6(a) shows that the CNTs formed in the first-stage reactor were twinned together and had non-uniform outer diameters of ∼10–16 nm. Contrarily, the solid phase products from the second-stage reactor were the relatively smooth CNTs 5.5 μm in length (Fig. 6(c)). Since the second-stage reactor was without catalysts addition, the CNTs found in the second-stage reactor were likely from the first-stage reactor. The formation of CNTs was attributed to the high efficiency of C–C cleavage and strong acidity of Ni/Al-SBA-15 catalyst. The acidic sites of catalysts promote the dehydrogenation and aromatization of plastics, thus causing the degradation of plastic into light hydrocarbons [9,27]. Owing to the lightweight property of the CNTs, they may have been formed in the first-stage reactor and flowed through to the second-stage. Furthermore, the amorphous carbon and char attached on the surface of CNTs would be gasified in the second-stage fluidized-bed at 800 °C lead to the smooth structure. In general, the thermal stability analyzed by TGA is used to determine the overall quality of the carbon products [42,43]. The results of TGA and the derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) profiles of the reacted catalysts and bed materials taken from different reaction temperatures of the first-stage reactor are shown in Fig. 7 . From the TGA profiles, the weight loss of the reacted catalysts can be divided into two intervals. The former and slighter one between 50 and 200 °C was related to the absorbed water from the reacted catalysts and bed materials, while the greater and latter weight loss between 450 and 750 °C is a result of oxidation of amorphous carbon and MWCNTs. Moreover, the CNTs fraction deposited on the reacted catalysts and bed materials was determined by the weight loss ratio between 500 and 750 °C [42–44]. The CNTs fraction of the solid phase from the first-stage fluidized-bed temperature of 500 °C gave the relatively high fraction (17%), and that of 700 °C showed the lowest fraction (10%). The higher oxidation temperature peak of the solid phase in the DTG profiles represent the CNTs that exhibited fewer defects and were of better quality. The DTG curves show that the highest oxidation peak at 700 °C was found for the solid phase from the first-stage temperature of 600 °C. On the contrary, the solid phase from the temperature of 500 °C had more disordered CNTs with a main oxidation peak at 632 °C. According to the activity performance and the solid phase properties, the first-stage fluidized-bed temperature controlled at 600 °C gave more CNTs with fewer defects and a H2 production rate of 527.1 mmol/h-g catalyst. When the first-stage reactor temperature was increased from 600 to 700 °C, the H2 production rate was increased by 7.6% (527.1–567.2 mmol/h-g catalyst). However, the reacted catalysts and bed materials from the temperature of 700 °C exhibited the lowest CNTs fraction. The optimal reaction temperature of the first-stage fluidized-bed reactor was 600 °C."
8,Effect of the equivalence ratio of first-stage fluidized-bed,"3.3 Effect of the equivalence ratio of first-stage fluidized-bed The ER was further evaluated for the optimal parameters of the two-stage fluidized-bed gasification system. Table 4 shows the main gaseous composition, gas yield, H2 yield, and H2 production rate of the first- and second-sampling points at different ERs of the two-stage gasification system and the reaction temperature of first- and second-stage reactor was controlled at 600 °C and 800 °C, respectively. The fluidized media of the first-stage was composed of 10 g Ni/Al-SBA-15-PL and 320 g silica sand, whereas the second-stage was made of 330 g silica sand. Theoretically, the ER increased from 0.1 to 0.2, due to more oxygen flowing into the system, and resulted in not only higher CO2 concentration but also more consumed H2 [45]. Nevertheless, the shorter residence time of the plastic influenced the CO2 concentration of 0.2 ER detected at 1st sampling point. This was lower than 0.1 ER as shown in Table 4. The concentrations of H2, CO, CH4, and C2–C5 hydrocarbons soared as the ER increased and lead to more oxidation and shorter residence time. When the gasified products flowed into the second-stage fluidized bed, the heavy hydrocarbons were converted into light gaseous products by the direct decomposition of hydrocarbons with the higher reaction temperature. Thus, the concentration of N2 and other CnHm dramatically decreased. Fig. 8 illustrates the solid phase products from the waste plastic gasification at the first-stage reactor of 600 °C and the second-stage reactor of 800 °C with different ERs. The results of the solid phase products distribution shown in Fig. 8 indicate that the amount of solid products from first-stage reactor was little changed when the ER was increased from 0.1 to 0.3. Besides, the solid phase products from the second-stage reactor decreased with the ER increase. This could be caused by more air introduced to the second-stage reactor with its higher reaction temperature resulting gasification of the tar and char. The influence of different ERs on the reacted catalysts and bed materials from the first-stage reactor was investigated by TGA as shown in Fig. 9 . The results had similarities to those shown in Fig. 7, with peaks associated with amorphous carbon (∼500 °C) and CNTs (500–750 °C) observed. The CNTs fraction from different ERs was found in the following order: 0.2 ER (19.3%) > 0.1 ER (17.0%) > 0.3 ER (11.1%). The results indicated that the surface of the solid phase from 0.1 ER might contain some amorphous carbons and heavy hydrocarbons. Moreover, the amorphous carbons and heavy hydrocarbons deposited on the surface of reacted catalysts and bed materials would be oxidized due to the increased proportion of air with 0.2 ER and then enhancing the CNTs fraction. The CNTs fraction was decreased by increasing the ER to 0.3 because the environment of excess air would contribute to the oxidation of CNTs precursor molecules. This is in accordance with the gas composition as shown in Table 4, where the results show a corresponding change in the concentration of CO2 from 1.68 to 2.67 mol% and a decrease of C2–C5 hydrocarbons from 1.67 to 1.25 mol% with the increase in ER from 0.2 to 0.3. In addition to the CNTs fraction, the higher oxidation peak of DTG profiles indicated better CNTs quality. Although the reacted catalysts and bed materials from 0.1 ER gave lower CNTs fraction, the main oxidation peak temperature of the solid products from 0.1 ER possessed better CNTs quality than that of from 0.2 ER."
9,Effect of the catalyst introduction in second-stage fluidized-bed,"3.4 Effect of the catalyst introduction in second-stage fluidized-bed From the above-mentioned investigation of the operating parameters of the first-stage fluidized-bed reactor, the reaction temperature of first-stage reactor controlled at 600 °C with 0.1 ER can produce more solid phase products of better quality and less defective CNTs with H2 production rate of 527.1 mmol/h-g catalyst. However, after upcycling waste plastics in the fluidized-bed gasification system with the addition of Ni/Al-SBA-15-PL catalysts in the first-stage reactor, the system still remained 64–68% other hydrocarbons with N2. These heavy hydrocarbons, such as tar and char, can be further converted into high heating-value gases H2 and CH4 to obtain energy and reduce the cost for tar and char elimination. Herein, we used 10 g of Ni–Cu/CaO–SiO2-PL catalysts to replace the silica sand as the fluidized media in the second-stage fluidized-bed reactor. The two-stage gasification system was controlled at the first-stage temperature of 600 °C and the second-stage temperature of 800 °C with the 0.1 ER. Table 5 shows the catalytic performance of the two-stage fluidized catalytic gasification system with and without adding Ni–Cu/CaO–SiO2-PL catalysts in the second-stage reactor. In Table 5, the label “without catalyst” represents that a part of Ni/Al-SBA-15-PL was added only in the first-stage reactor, and the second-stage reactor was without catalyst. The label “with catalyst” depicted that Ni/Al-SBA-15-PL was added in the first-stage reactor and Ni–Cu/CaO–SiO2-PL was added in the second-stage reactor. When the Ni–Cu/CaO–SiO2-PL was added in the second-stage fluidized-bed reactor, the concentration of H2 detected at 2nd sampling point was significantly increased from 2.64 to 13.97%. The composition of CO and CH4 also exhibited a noticeable growth. Moreover, after the second-stage catalytic reaction, the H2 production rate was increased from 161.9 to 857.6 mmol/h-g catalyst. Two possible reasons induced to the promotion of H2 production rate, one was that the introduction of Ni–Cu/CaO–SiO2-PL could promote the catalytic dry reforming of heavy hydrocarbons and the direct decomposition of hydrocarbons lead to a sharp decrease of the concentration of N2 and other CnHm hydrocarbons from 90.25 to 57.97 mol%. Ni–Cu catalysts have been used in steam reforming for H2 production because of the synergistic effects of enhancing the C–C bond cleavage and the water−gas shift reaction [26,46]. Another possible reason was that the higher H2 production rate could be ascribed to the enhancement of waste plastics gasification by CaO which brought about less tar and char residual [47,48]. According to our previous study [48], the presence of CaO could enhance biomass gasification and produce less residual char, resulting in a higher H2 production. CaO has been selected not only as an effective sorbent for CO2 capture, but also as a catalyst for tar decomposition during biomass gasification. CaO can absorb CO2 and turn into CaCO3, thereby reducing the CO2 in the gasifying composition. The decrease of CO2 in the syngas would promote the water−gas shift reaction, generating more H2. Moreover, CaO plays the role of tar reduction catalyst by enhancing the tar reforming reaction. The carbonization, water−gas shift, and tar reforming reactions can be expressed as the following Eqs. (7)–(9) [47,49]: (7) C a r b o n i z a t i o n r e a c t i o n : C a O + C O 2 → C a C O 3 (8) W a t e r − g a s s h i f t r e a c t i o n : C O + H 2 O → C O 2 + H 2 (9) T a r r e f o r m i n g r e a c t i o n : T a r s + H 2 O → C a O H 2 + C O 2 + C O + h y d r o c a r b o n s + ⋯ As a result of Ni–Cu/CaO–SiO2-PL in the second-stage fluidized bed, the increase of the H2 and gas yield can be attributed to the tar catalytic reforming of CaO. A similar result was reported by Udomsirichakorn et al. [49] that the more CaO in the gasifier, the less tar content was found in the system. In a comparison of with and without adding Ni–Cu/CaO–SiO2-PL in the second-stage reactor, it was found that the promotion ratio of H2 concentration of with Ni–Cu/CaO–SiO2-PL was about 4 times higher than the other."
10,Effect of the reaction temperature of second-stage fluidized-bed,"3.5 Effect of the reaction temperature of second-stage fluidized-bed In order to better understand the feasibility of the two-stage fluidized catalytic bed gasification system, the effects of the second-stage reaction temperature on the gaseous composition, H2 production rate, and solid products during the waste plastics gasification was investigated in this study. Table 6 shows the main compositions of the gaseous products, gas yield, H2 yield, and the H2 production rate at the first-stage reactor of 600 °C and the second-stage reactor of different temperatures with an ER of 0.1. As shown in Table 6, the concentration of H2 and CH4 at the 2nd sampling point was increased and that of the CO2 was dropped when the second-stage reaction temperature rose from 600 to 800 °C. The H2 and CH4 contents increased with decreased CO2 mainly as a result of the dry reforming and cracking of heavy hydrocarbons at higher reaction temperature [50–52]. Even though the methane decomposition would be enhanced at high temperature and result in the CH4 concentration decrease, the introduction of Ni–Cu/CaO–SiO2 at the second-stage fluidized-bed enhanced the direct plastics decomposition. The H2 production rate was increased from 733.8 to 857.6 mmol/h-g catalyst with the increase in second-stage temperature from 600 to 800 °C. The H2 production rate is correlated with the fraction of condensable products. The condensable products, such as heavy CnHm hydrocarbons, flowed through the second-stage fluidized-bed were catalyzed to generate H2 [48]. According to the solid phase products distribution of the two-stage fluidized bed from different second-stage temperatures shown in Fig. 10 , it was found that the solid phase products decreased with increasing temperature from 600 to 700 °C. Because the Ni–Cu/CaO–SiO2 facilitated the tar steam reforming, the C2–C5 hydrocarbons and other heavy hydrocarbons formed during the plastics gasification were converted into gaseous products. Further increasing the second-stage reactor temperature to 800 °C, nonetheless, the solid phase products were increased. This increase of the solid phase products was probably affected by the copper reacting with air at the high temperature, and it formed CuO and was followed by the decrease of nickel dispersion on the support and the catalytic activity [53]. The TGA results of the reacted catalysts and bed materials from the second-stage reactor of different temperatures shown in Fig. 11 indicate that the CNTs fraction followed in the order of 700 °C (69.0%) > 800 °C (48.0%) > 600 °C (43.5%). The solid products obtained from the second-stage reactor of 700 °C possessed two oxidation peaks at 658 and 700 °C, while those with the reaction temperature of 600 and 800 °C exhibited the main oxidation peak at 530–640 °C with more amorphous carbons and disordered CNTs. The results evidenced that the higher second-stage reaction temperature (800 °C) might damage the CNTs structure and gave a lower CNTs quality. By contrast, the solid phase products obtained at the second-stage reactor of 700 °C possessed a higher degree of graphitization CNTs. This clearly means that with the higher, second-stage fluidized catalytic bed temperature, better hydrogen production activity was brought about. Whereas, if the reaction temperature was too high, it would inhibit the activity of Ni–Cu/CaO–SiO2 and decrease the CNTs fraction. From the perspective of amounts of CNTs in the solid products, the second-stage catalytic bed controlled at 800 °C possessed the highest CNTs fraction. Thus, the second-stage reactor controlled at 800 °C exhibited the optimal catalytic performance for co-production of hydrogen and CNTs. Furthermore, the comparison between our results and those of literatures using different types of reactors is listed in Table 7 [1,2,24,54,55]. Compared to similar studies using different types of reactors, such as fixed bed and fluidized bed with Ni-based catalysts and the catalysis temperature selected as 700–800 °C, the two-stage fluidized bed exhibited better H2 production rate and relatively high CNTs fraction. It may because the waste plastics could be gasified into light hydrocarbons and formed CNTs by Ni/Al-SBA-15 in the first-stage fluidized bed and then the remaining hydrocarbons would upgrade by Ni–Cu/CaO–SiO2 to produce H2 in the second-stage fluidized bed. The catalytic process for co-production of CNTs and H2 from waste plastics gasification in a two-stage fluidized-bed system can be elucidated as shown in Fig. 1. Waste plastics were continuously fed into the first-stage reactor and gasified into lots of hydrocarbons. The strong acidity of Ni/Al-SBA-15 catalyst is beneficial to the degradation of plastic chains and the dehydrogenation and aromatization of the waste plastics to form light hydrocarbons and aromatics, which are used as the carbon source to form CNTs in the first-stage reactor. The producing hydrocarbons from the first-stage reactor, including liquid, gaseous, and solid, were passing through the second-stage fluidized-bed and upgraded by Ni–Cu/CaO–SiO2 catalyst facilitating the C–C bond breakage, tar reforming, and water−gas shift reaction to produce more hydrogen."
11,Conclusion,"A two-stage fluidized catalytic bed reactor system for continuous co-production of CNTs and hydrogen from waste plastics gasification was developed in this study. The Ni/Al-SBA-15-PL and Ni–Cu/CaO–SiO2-PL were applied for CNTs and hydrogen production in this two-stage system, respectively. To investigate the feasibility of the simultaneous production of CNTs and hydrogen from waste plastics gasification, the reaction temperatures and ERs were varied to evaluate the optimal parameter of the fluidized catalytic bed. When the Ni/Al-SBA-15-PL partially replaced fluidized media in the first-stage reactor, increasing the temperature of the first-stage reactor enhanced the degradation of waste plastics into CH4 and C2–C5 hydrocarbons for CNTs formation. The temperature of first-stage reactor increased to 700 °C would inhibit the water−gas shift reaction and promote the reforming and decomposition of solid phase hydrocarbons, thus resulting in lowered solid phase amounts and the degree of graphitization CNTs. Moreover, increasing the ER from 0.1 to 0.3 decreased the concentration H2, CO, CH4, and C2–C5 light hydrocarbons detected at 1st sampling point because of more oxygen in the gas-flow and shorter residence time declining the catalytic thermal cracking and reforming of hydrocarbons. Further adding Ni–Cu/CaO–SiO2-PL in the second-stage fluidized-bed effectively improved the dry reforming of heavy hydrocarbons and the direct decomposition of plastics, the H2 production rate remarkably elevated to 857.6 mmol/h-g catalyst. Increasing the reaction temperature of the second-stage fluidized catalytic bed from 600 to 800 °C promoted the char dry reforming and tar decomposition to smaller-molecule hydrocarbons which in favor of the co-production of CNTs and hydrogen. The reaction temperature of the first- and second-stage catalytic reactor operated at 600 and 800 °C, respectively, with an ER of 0.1 could bring about hydrogen and high CNTs fraction. Overall, this study provides a new perspective for simultaneous CNTs and hydrogen production in the two-stage fluidized catalytic bed system and demonstrates the optimal operating parameters for further potential pilot-scale works."
