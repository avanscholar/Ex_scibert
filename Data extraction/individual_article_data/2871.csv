0,Introduction,"Olive oil is one of the oldest natural ingredients in the world. Based on several archeological tablets found in ancient tombs, its history goes back almost 8000 years to when the first trees were cultivated in the Syrian/Iranian region of the Middle East [1]. Then, olives continued to move westward into Turkey, Greece, Egypt, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco. Recently, there are many olive oil mills located around the Mediterranean area, accounting for approximately 95% of the worldwide olive oil production [2]. In Turkey, olive oil processing is generally carried out by various small facilities rather than by large refineries. These facilities are principally located around the Mediterranean, Aegean, and Marmara coastal regions where olive trees grow. Olive oil production is a seasonal operation, which starts generally in September and ends in February at the latest [3]. The wastewater of this manufacturing process, so-called olive mill wastewater (OMW), is a considerable pollutant because of its extremely high organic matter contents, comparatively high chemical oxygen demand (COD), and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) values that can reach up to 200kgm−3 and 100kgm−3, respectively [4]. The phenolic content of OMW ranges between 1.5kgm−3 and 4kgm−3 [5]. OMW is a dark-colored liquid containing many dissolved and suspended substances. The solid content mainly comes from olive fruit residues such as olive pulp, husk, and some lignin derivatives that are not easily biodegraded. The characteristic brown–black color of this effluent is chemically related to polymers of low molecular weight phenolic compounds and lignin derivatives. The precise color mainly depends on the age and type of oil processed and also the type of the technology used. Fresh OMW has a strong and characteristic smell. The wastewater is slightly acidic, having pH values from 3 to 5. This type of wastewater is generally composed of water (83–94%), organic matter (4–16%) and mineral salts (0.4–2.5%) [6–8]. Oils (1–14%), polysaccharides (13–53%), proteins (8–16%), organic acids (3–10%), polyalcohols (3–10%) and polyphenols (2–15%) are listed as its main organic contents [9]. More than 50 phenolic compounds, many alcohols, aldehydes and other low molecular weight compounds have been reported in the literature [10]. Among these, the compounds with a phenolic structure deserve a special attention because of their influence coloration and phytotoxic effect [11]. Mineral salts of OMW are mainly carbonates (21%), phosphates (14%), potassium (47%) and sodium (7%) [9]. Total suspended solid (TSS) is principally derived from the olive pulp and contains mainly cellulose and pectins [12]. Both quality and quantity of OMW are highly variable as a result of several factors such as [13]: (i) type of production process, (ii) type of olives, (iii) area under cultivation, (iv) use of pesticides and fertilizers, (v) climatic conditions, and (vi) harvesting time (i.e. stage of olive maturity). Some microorganisms such as algae, cyanobacteria, and anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria are capable of biological hydrogen production. Photosynthetic bacteria are the most favorable candidates due to their high conversion efficiency and substrate versatility. Hydrogen production by photosynthetic bacteria (such as Rhodobacter sphaeroides) occurs under illumination and from the breakdown of organic substrates in the absence of oxygen; this process is known as photofermentation. One way to improve the economics of photofermentative hydrogen production is to couple this process with waste treatment. Many recent studies have focused on the utilization of residual food and agricultural wastes or wastewaters with high levels of organic compounds, thereby providing both energy production and waste treatment [14–21]. In our previous studies, it was proven that olive mill wastewater could be utilized for photobiological hydrogen production as a sole substrate source [6,7,14]. The objective of the current study was to understand the effect of different OMW compositions on photofermentative hydrogen production. Since the physicochemical properties of OMW samples are quite unpredictable for each olive oil mill, a detailed analysis of each sample is extremely essential for such a comparative study. Photofermentation experiments were carried out in small-scale indoor bioreactors (55cm3); this provides an opportunity for comparative experiments by operating several parallel runs at the same time. Such a study is valuable for its wide range of analyses of various samples and for the comparison of many parameters for hydrogen production. The overall results obtained throughout this study can help process engineers select the most appropriate chemical composition from various waste materials for future biohydrogen applications and studies."

4,Results and discussion,"Olive mill wastewater samples utilized throughout this study were obtained from four different olive oil mills in Western-Anatolia, Turkey. Since their physicochemical properties depend on many parameters, it is not possible to attribute a uniform composition for OMW. Thus, detailed analysis of each sample has been initially carried out for such a comparative study. Main characteristic properties obtained for these OMW samples are given in Table 1 . As can be seen from Table 1, all OMW samples are slightly acidic with pH values around 4. They have significant amounts of COD, BOD, solid matter, phenol and sugar content, in which their color is proportional with the amount of their solid matter and phenolic content. The sample (OMW-A) having the darkest color (79250 PtCo APHA) also contains the highest total phenol (18.9kgm−3) and total solid content (35.9kgm−3). Likewise, the lightest color of OMW-C (47500 PtCo APHA) is attributed to its lowest phenol (7.9kgm−3) and solid (12.2kgm−3) content. Solid particles such as the olive fruit residues (i.e. olive pulp, husk, and some lignin derivatives) are known to be consisted of hardly biodegradable and dark-colored aromatic compounds [12]. According to the C/H/N elemental analysis on dry basis, the molar C/N ratio followed a decreasing order as: OMW-D (73.8)>OMW-A (59.5)>OMW-B (48.4)>OMW-C (42.3). Calculation of this parameter is essential for photosynthetic hydrogen production studies, since hydrogen production is known to be favored for the substrates with higher C/N ratio [22]. In the literature, the optimal C/N ratio for biological hydrogen production ranges from 3.3 to 130 [23]. Lin and Lay [24] reported an optimal C/N ratio of 47 for hydrogen production from sucrose. R. sphaeroides O.U.001 was grown in these different OMW samples for photofermentative hydrogen production. Volumetric ratio of raw OMW in the photofermentor inlets was 4%, owing to the results of a previous study examining the optimum OMW dilution rates for an efficient hydrogen production [6]. Figs. 1 and 2 illustrate the changes in the total volume of hydrogen gas production and bacterial growth at different OMW samples, respectively. Another parameter that gained an importance in biohydrogen studies is the ratio of hydrogen gas production per bacterial weight, which is given in Fig. 3 . Three independent measurements for OMW-A, -C and -D; and five independent measurements for OMW-B sample were carried out for the calculation of the average data, and their standard errors are shown as error bars in the subsequent figures. Total amount of hydrogen gas production was within the range of 40–24cm3 (Fig. 1). The highest amount of hydrogen was obtained from the OMW-D sample, which had the highest organic content (especially acetic, aspartic, and glutamic acids) and also the highest carbon-to-nitrogen molar ratio (73.8) as tabulated in Table 1. Higher light penetration capacity of a medium is known to enhance photofermentation [6]; nonetheless it is not an adequate parameter for an efficient hydrogen production. Accordingly, the OMW-C sample which had the brightest color (47500 PtCo APHA) resulted in the lowest hydrogen production due to its lowest organic content. OMW-D has a significantly higher ratio of hydrogen gas production per bacterial weight (Fig. 3), which enhances its eligibility for being utilized as a substrate source during photofermentative hydrogen production. Besides, the principal goal is to produce hydrogen rather than producing the highest amount of bacteria. The results of photofermentative H2 production with different OMW samples are summarized in Table 2 . One of the important aspects on the photobioreactor design is the light conversion efficiency (η) [25]. Photofermentation with OMW-C sample resulted higher light conversion efficiency (0.33%) due to its brightest color that increases its light absorption capacity. Two expressions were used for the determination of gas production rate within the present study. The first is the average gas production rate per culture volume (r g), which is calculated by dividing the total volume of gas produced by the volume of the culture and by the duration of gas production, with the unit of m3 m−3 d−1. The second expression is the average gas production rate per bacterial dry weight (r g 1) that is obtained by the time averaging of individual rates and has the unit of m3 kg−1 d−1. The individual rates for a certain period were calculated by dividing the volume increment of gas produced by the average cell concentration and by the duration of that period [6,7,14]. Rate values of the current study are comparable with the rates mentioned in the literature. In the present study, r g and r g 1 results are within a range of 0.17–0.34m3 m−3 d−1, and 0.29–1.06m3 kg−1 d−1, respectively. Sunita and Mitra [15] found a rate of 0.05m3 m−3 d−1 from the sewage wastewater by the free cells and by the immobilized cells with a rate of 0.07m3 m−3 d−1. Sasikala and Ramana observed a hydrogen production rate of 0.12m3 m−3 d−1 and 0.05m3 kg−1 d−1 with 50% wastewater of lactic acid fermentation plant, using free R. sphaeroides O.U.001 [16]. Also, Zhu et al. [17] calculated hydrogen production rate of 1.42m3 m−3 d−1 with tofu wastewater. Immobilization process and the utilization of different strain (i.e. R. sphaeroides RV) might be the reasons for their higher rates. Türkarslan et al. [18] obtained 0.14m3 kg−1 d−1 with the mixture of malate and diary plant wastewater. Eroğlu et al. [6] observed the maximum rates (0.22m3 m−3 d−1 and 0.50m3 kg−1 d−1) for the case of 1% OMW containing media, using R. sphaeroides O.U.001 in 400cm3 column photobioreactors. The hydrogen production potential (HPP), which is defined as total hydrogen gas produced per volume of OMW, has a highest value of 20m3 m−3 for the OMW-D sample in addition to its lowest lag time (10h). The hydrogen production potentials determined in this study, are relatively higher than the results reported in literature. For example, Sasikala and Ramana [16] reported a potential of 4.5m3 m−3 for 10% lactic acid fermentation plant wastewater. In another study of the same group, 1.0m3 m−3 and 3.0m3 m−3 were obtained for the case with free cells, and with immobilized cells in 10% distillery wastewater, respectively [19]. Zhu et al. [17] determined HPP as 1.9m3 m−3 for tofu wastewater, utilizing immobilized cells in agar gels. In our previous study with olive mill wastewater, we reported the highest potential as 14m3 m−3 in a 400-cm3 column photobioreactors [6]. Yetiş et al. [20] observed 8.6m3 m−3 HPP values by the supplementation of malate into sugar refinery wastewater. As a consequence, hydrogen production with these OMW samples appears to be a quite favorable process. As regards to its highest amount of hydrogen production in parallel to its organic acid rich medium, OMW-D sample was chosen to be the optimum media to be utilized for photofermentative hydrogen production."
5,Conclusions,"Four different OMW samples having various physicochemical properties have been initially analyzed and utilized separately for photofermentative hydrogen production. On the basis of organic acids, they all contain high amounts of acetic acid; upon which aspartic and glutamic acids are the main amino acids. Besides; ethanol, normal-phenol, and meta-cresol are present at high amounts. A straight relation was observed between the C/N molar ratios and the hydrogen production capacities of different OMW samples. The highest hydrogen production potential was obtained from the OMW sample which has the highest organic content (mainly acetic, aspartic, and glutamic acids) and the highest carbon-to-nitrogen molar ratio (73.8MM−1). In such circumstances, when there are several OMW alternatives; sample with the highest C/N ratio and organic acid content should be chosen for photofermentative hydrogen production. On the other hand, if the only existing OMW sample has low level of C/N ratio, its organic carbon as well as C/N ratio needs to be enhanced by the addition of external carbon source for an efficient hydrogen production. Supplementing with other waste streams, which are located nearby (e.g. domestic wastewaters or other agro-industrial wastewaters with low nitrogen content) can be a practical and economical option."
