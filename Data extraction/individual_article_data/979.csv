0,Introduction,"With the rapid economic development, fossil fuels have been increasingly consumed in a large amount leading to a series of ecological and environmental problems. To alleviate the oil crisis and environmental pollution, alternative energy sources have been developed. Bio-hydrogen production technology is a promising solution to fossil fuel depletion, global warming and air pollution for its mild reaction conditions and environmental benefits. Hydrogen has a high heat value (122 kJ/g), which is 2.75 times that of conventional gasoline (Elsamadony and Tawfik, 2015). There is no greenhouse gas and toxic gases left but only water after hydrogen was combusted. Hydrogen will be a potential contributor to future energy demands due to its environment-friendly character and abundant availability as well as renewability. Bio-hydrogen production can be achieved by bio-photolysis, photo fermentation and dark fermentation. Bio-photolysis, which is carried out by microalgae, split water molecule into oxygen and hydrogen. However, because of the low photochemical efficiency, it has not yet been practiced in the industry even if the process requires only solar energy and water at standard temperature and pressure (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017). Dark fermentation (DF) is a process in which microbes convert organic matter to hydrogen, CO2, organic acids and solvents in the absence of light. DF has been extensively studied during the last decades because hydrogen can be produced from biomass waste in low operation cost (Khanna and Das, 2013). Paper sludge (PS) is a kind of waste produced in pulping and papermaking process. By 2012, the amount of dry PS production is 0.26 Gt/a in China (Fang et al., 2015) and 0.2–0.6 ton of sludge is generated for every ton of pulp produced (Meyer and Edwards, 2014). Some disposal methods have been used for PS, such as landfill, agricultural application and incineration (Fang et al., 2015). Secondary pollution, such as atmosphere and water contamination, might be caused if the disposal is improperly managed. Incineration has been widely applied for the sludge treatment for the volume reduction and electricity or heat generation. However, high moisture content, high ash and low calorific value restricted its stability (Xie and Ma, 2013). PS consists of paper fillers (such as calcium carbonate, kaolin and soluble silicates, etc.), fibers (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) and lignin-byproducts (Bayr and Rintala, 2012). The composition of the PS is highly relevant to the raw materials used and pulping and papermaking process. Primary sludge (dry weight) from recycled paper mills consists of 54.18%, 7.17%, 7.31%, 2.75% of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and ash, respectively (Moreau et al., 2015). Secondary sludge, which is generated in the clarifier of the biological units of the wastewater treatment, has lower wood fiber content compared to primary sludge which is generated from primary clarifier where the big fiber was sieved (Bayr and Rintala, 2012). Therefore, microbes and cell-decay products derived from effluent disposal exist in secondary sludge. PS can be used to produce ethanol through enzymatic hydrolysis and yeast fermentation (Marques et al., 2008). The hydrogen production from PS by anaerobic fermentation has been attempted (Kádár et al., 2004; Lin et al., 2013). Kádár et al. (2004) studied hydrogen production from PS hydrolysate by extreme thermophilic anaerobic fermentation but attained low hydrogen yield. The high price and amount of cellulase undoubtedly increase production costs. Mesophilic anaerobic hydrogen production from co-digestion of pulp & paper sludge and food waste had been explored by Lin et al. (2013), and hydrogen yield of 64.48 mL/g VSfed was achieved. In recent years, the hydrogen production by using indigenous anaerobic microorganisms within the waste material has been studied (Kim et al., 2009; Yokoyama et al., 2007). Thus, it was hypothesized that PS could serve as substrate and hydrogen-producing microbes in DF. In this case, it would simplify the operation for hydrogen production in practical application and be conductive to develop decentralized hydrogen production & biological waste disposal system, which is beneficial for energy and environment security. Biochemical pathways involved in the DF are based on rather complex and diverse microorganisms. Therefore, it is important to understand the diversity and abundance of the microbial communities during the hydrogen production from PS. Clostridium thermocellum is thermophilic and Gram-positive bacterium, which can convert cellulose into hydrogen, ethanol, carbon dioxide and acetic acid, etc. at the same time. It has attained a wide range of attention in biorefinery for its potential application in Consolidated Bioprocessing (CBP), a process combining cellulase production, saccharification and fermentation (Cheng and Zhu, 2013). The inoculation of cellulose degrading bacteria to the anaerobic fermentation system can improve the fermentation efficiency and the yield of products. Tsapekos et al. (2017) revealed that the C. thermocellum addition increased methane yield up to 34% when studying bio-methane production from lignocellulosic biomass. The valorization of PS for hydrogen production by DF offers a big potential for both clean fuel production and waste disposal. The purpose of this study was to explore the dynamic changes of microbes in the thermophilic anaerobic fermentation process of PS without extra inoculation by analyzing 16S rDNA gene sequences. Then, C. thermocellum was inoculated to the process for higher hydrogen yield and substrate degradation rate in batch fermentation, and the PS concentration was also optimized for maximum hydrogen production."
1,Materials and methods,"The dynamic changes of microbes in the thermophilic anaerobic fermentation process of PS without extra inoculation were analyzed by 16S rDNA gene sequences using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 PE250 platform and UPARSE software (Uparse v7.0.1001). Then, C. thermocellum DSM 1313 was inoculated in 125 mL serum bottles with a working volume of 40 mL to improve the performance of hydrogen yield and substrate degradation rate and the PS concentration was also optimized for maximum hydrogen production in batch fermentation."
2,Substrate and inoculum,"2.1 Substrate and inoculum PS in this study was obtained from a wastewater treatment unit at Donghua paper Co., Ltd. (Foshan, Guangdong province, China) which produce paper towel from waste paper. The PS was stored at −20 °C after dehydration, and thawed at 4 °C before use. C. thermocellum DSM 1313 was purchased from Leibniz Institute DSMZ – German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Braunschweig, Germany). C. thermocellum inoculum was prepared anaerobically with 10 g/L Avicel pH-105 (FMC, USA) as carbon source in DSMZ 122 medium (Leibniz Inst. DSMZ, 2016). C. thermocellum was transferred into the serum bottles with 10% (v/v) inoculum size by injection syringe. All of the hydrogen production as follows was performed at 55 °C with rotary shaking at 150 rpm."
3,Hydrogen production from PS without inoculation,"2.2 Hydrogen production from PS without inoculation 125 mL serum bottles were used with a working volume of 40 mL for all the fermentation. Briefly, each bottle contained 7.4% (w/v, dry weight) PS to replace carbon source in the medium and was sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and aluminum seal. The bottles were incubated in a shaking incubator (C24KC refrigerated incubator shaker, Edison, New Jersey, United States) immediately after purged and gassed with 99.99% nitrogen three times. The fermentation was performed in 24 replicates and lasted 8 days, where three of the replicates were sacrificed for hydrogen test each day and liquid samples were taken from it. The liquid samples were centrifuged at 6800 g for 10 min, and the supernatants were used for organic acid and ethanol test. The sediments of 1 d, 4 d and 7 d were stored at −80 °C for further DNA extraction."
4,DNA extraction and microbial community analysis,"2.3 DNA extraction and microbial community analysis Microbial genomic DNA of 1 d, 4 d and 7 d precipitation were extracted by the E.Z.N.A.® Soil DNA Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA, USA) according to the manufacturer protocol. DNA quantity and specificity were determined by NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) and agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively. The microbial community of the samples was identified by amplifying and analyzing the V4 region of 16S rRNA from the genome DNA. The amplicons sequencing was conducted on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 PE250 platform by Novogene Bioinformatics Technology (Beijing, China). After sequencing, paired-end reads from the original DNA fragments were merged using FLASH (Zhang et al., 2014) and assigned to each sample with the unique barcodes. Sequences with ≥97% similarity were assigned to the same operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and analysis was performed using UPARSE software (Uparse v7.0.1001) (Edgar, 2013). Representative sequences were picked for each OTU and annotated the taxonomic information using RDP classifier (Version 2.2). The reported OTU data represent the average of two sequencing results. Sequencing results are available through the NCBI sequence read archive (SRA) database with the accession number SRP134226."
5,Hydrogen production from PS enhanced by Clostridium thermocellum,"2.4 Hydrogen production from PS enhanced by Clostridium thermocellum 48 fermentation serum bottles were the same as described in 2.2 and was divided into two groups. C. thermocellum was transferred into one group which called inoculation group with 10% (v/v) inoculum size by injection syringe, and the other group called non-inoculation group was injected equivalent medium without carbon source. The residues in the endpoint were collected and dried at 60 °C for components analysis. For the Optimization of substrate concentration, a series of substrate concentration (5.4, 7.4 and 9.3%, w/v, dry weight) were considered in batch fermentation experiments for 4 days."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods TS, VS of PS were determined according to the Standard Methods (APHA, 2005). The composition analysis of raw PS and residue at the endpoint of the fermentation was carried out according to the procedures recommended by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL, 2012). Hydrogen concentration was measured with a gas chromatograph (Fuli 9790Plus, Fuli, China) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) as previously described by Cheng and Zhu (2013). The organic acid and ethanol in the fermentation supernatants were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatograph (Waters 1525, Waters, LA, US) equipped with a refractive index detector (Waters 2414, Waters, LA, US) at temperature of 40 °C and Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) operating at 60 °C. Hydrogen production yield was calculated by dividing the cumulative total hydrogen volume to the initial VS added. The degradation rate of cellulose and hemicellulose in PS were calculated using Eq. (1). (1) Degradation rate % = 1 - Residue weight of PS × Content B Initial weight of PS × Content A where Content A and Content B are the cellulose (or hemicellulose) content in the raw PS and residual PS after fermentation, respectively. The modified Gompertz equation (Eq. (2)) described by Chen et al. (2006) was employed to assess the hydrogen potential in inoculation and non-inoculation processes. The model has been widely used to describe biogas production (such as methane, hydrogen) in batch mode. Cumulative hydrogen volume and time data were correlated with the Gompertz equation and the parameters were determined with analysis using the software Origin 9.0. (2) H t = P exp - exp Rm · e H λ - t + 1 where H (t) is the cumulative hydrogen (mL) at time (t), P is the maximum hydrogen production potential (mL), Rm is the maximum hydrogen production rate (mL/h), λ is the lag phase (h) and e is the constant of 2.71828. The cumulative hydrogen production potential, hydrogen production rate and lag phase were used to compare the performance of hydrogen production process."
7,Statistical analysis,2.6 Statistical analysis The data were analyzed statistically by Student’s t test using the software SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago) and a value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
8,Result and discussion,
9,Hydrogen production from PS by anaerobic thermophilic fermentation without inoculation,"3.1 Hydrogen production from PS by anaerobic thermophilic fermentation without inoculation The TS and VS of PS were 37.05% and 13.56%, respectively. The main chemical components of the PS (dry weigh) were 19.21% cellulose, 6.71% hemicellulose, 1.87% acid soluble lignin and 61.16% ash. The hydrogen production from PS by anaerobic thermophilic fermentation without inoculation is presented in Fig. 1 . As shown in Fig. 1a, the maximum hydrogen production was 64.32 mM achieved at 168 h, indicating significant contribution of natural microorganisms in the PS to hydrogen production. At the initial stage of hydrogen production (0–48 h), hydrogen was produced in a higher rate and other metabolites (acetate, ethanol, butyrate and formate) were produced simultaneously (Fig. 1b). The pH value of the fermentation broth decreased to below 6.2 at 48 h, leading to slow hydrogen production rate during the stable stage (48–144 h), where only a few bacteria can maintain normal growth and metabolism at the low pH. The production of organic acids and ethanol increased continuously despite low pH after 48 h (Fig. 1b), which may be resulted from acid-tolerant bacteria. The metabolic rate of some bacteria was significant influenced by the pH of extracellular environment when the broth pH value was far away from the optimal pH (Hu et al., 2018). Zhang et al. (2003) reported that genus Thermoanaerobacterium play a leading role in hydrogen production from starch waste water at pH 6.0 under thermophilic condition. Interestingly, diauxic hydrogen formation phenomenon was observed in the process. The possible reason is that the metabolites (such as, acetate and ethanol) existence can promote cell growth and hydrogen production by some bacteria. It was reported that 3 g/L acetic acid increased hydrogen production by more than 50% from sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate fermented by T. thermosaccharolyticum MJ1 (Hu et al., 2018). Addition of exogenous acetate (up to 3.28 g/L, near the concentration in our study, Fig. 1b) and ethanol (up to 10.35 g/L) significantly stimulated H2 yield by Caloramator celer compared to the control without any metabolites supplement (Ciranna et al., 2014), while hydrogen yield gradually decreased as increasing acetate addition in the fermentation of E. harbinese B49 (Tang et al., 2012). The effects of metabolites on hydrogen production depend on the characteristics of dynamic strains during the process. Hydrogen production decreased at the end of fermentation, which might be attributed to the methanogens, sulfate-reducing bacteria and acetogens who could consume hydrogen as a substrate coupling with hydrogen oxidation to energy conservation and growth."
10,Bacterial diversity during the process of hydrogen production from PS without inoculation,"3.2 Bacterial diversity during the process of hydrogen production from PS without inoculation Microbial diversity and dynamics during the fermentation process were analyzed by Illumina HiSeq sequencing. After the sequence quality filtering, a total number of 456,581 effective tags were achieved for the tested sample, using operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which were created using a 97% similarity threshold that enabled the identification of all the major groups. Firmicutes appeared to be the principle phylum with more than 75% of all the sequences in three samples. As shown in Fig. 2 , the ten most dominant orders constituted 94.23–98.16% of all sequences. Clostridiales were the most predominant bacteria order and constituted 84.19, 76.95, and 88.06% of all sequences in 1 d, 4 d, and 7 d respectively. Members of Clostridiales were also discovered in other anaerobic fermentation samples from reactors dealing with lignocellulosic materials. Clostridiales is popular in cellulose degradation and hydrogen production, such as Clostridiaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae (Biddle et al., 2013), which also predominated in this process. Clostridiales play an essential role in cellulose chain breakdown by expressing active exocellulases and endocellulases (Xia et al., 2015). The relative abundance of order Thermoanaerobacterales decreased from 17.52% at 4 d to 5.48% at 7 d. Order Thermoanaerobacterales was thought as a consortium of hemicellulose-utilizing organisms within the class Clostridia. Genera Thermoanaerobacterium of order Thermoanaerobacterales, which have been extensively studied in lignocellulosic ethanol production, may contribute to the ethanol production (Chang and Yao, 2011). Order Clostridiales sprang up in advance and Thermoanaerobacteriales secondly. The orders Clostridiales and Thermoanaerobacteriales, which achieving the most attention for thermophilic CBP, play a major role in the whole process of the fermentation (Verbeke et al., 2013). Bacteria of the genus Mobilitalea dominated in the sample at 1 d with 69.28% relative abundance, but it declined with time going (Fig. 2b). Mobilitalea is a novel genus of family Lachnospiraceae and order Clostridiales proposed by Podosokorskaya et al. (2014) when identifying a pure halotolerant culture which was able to degrade microcrystalline cellulose. The lowest pH value for growth of Mobilitalea sibirica was 6.4. The declining relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae from 1 d to 4 d coincided with change of genus Mobilitalea. Family Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae dominated in the process, which were also popular in stomach of rumen animals and responsible for roughage fiber degradation (Mao et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2017). Ruminiclostridum (former Clostridum, 39.15%) and Thermoanaerobacterium (16.19%) were abundant at 4 d (Fig. 2b). Zahedi et al. (2016) found that Clostridium sp. clusters represented 76% of total Firmicutes in the hydrogen production phase of the bio-waste anaerobic digestion. Microorganisms belonging to Ruminiclostridum were responsible for cellulose degradation and hydrogen production, such as Clostridium thermobutyrate (Canganella et al., 2002), Clostridium clariflavum and Clostridium caenicola (Shiratori et al., 2009). The bacteria of genera Thermoanaerobacterium are known for their hydrogen production ability, including T. thermosaccharolyticum, T. polysaccharolyticum, T. zeae, T. lactoethylicum and T. aotearoense, and the optimal growth pH value of these organisms is 5.2–7.8 (Zhang et al., 2003). Thermoanaerobacterium spp. are capable of utilizing complex substrates to produce hydrogen, such as xylan (Currie et al., 2014), cellulose (Sheng et al., 2015) and starch (O-Thong et al., 2008). Bacteria that belong to the genera Thermoanaerobacterium, of order Thermoanaerobacteriales, multiplied faster than other bacterial species and dominated in terms of the percentage because the fermentation conditions were more suitable for their growth and other orders eclipsed at the same time, which is consistent with Fig. 3 . As can be seen from Fig. 3, many genera were in high relative abundance at 1 d. This may be caused by residual dead cells from the raw PS for the sequences analyzing whether cells are alive or not. After several days’ fermentation, some strains stand out at 4 d and 7 d, such as Thermoanaerobacterium and Ruminiclostridium. Desulfotomaculum, a kind of spore-forming sulfate-reducing bacteria, can use hydrogen as electron donors for sulfate reduction (Widdel, 2006; Klemps et al., 1985). The relative abundance of genera desulfotomaculum was high at 7 d, which might be responsible for the decreasing hydrogen production at the end of fermentation."
11,Enhanced hydrogen production from PS by C. thermocellum,"3.3 Enhanced hydrogen production from PS by C. thermocellum Although hydrogen can be produced by the indigenous strains of PS, the efficiency and yield of hydrogen production were not enough for commercial application. Hydrolysis was rate-limiting step for DFwhen the substrate is complex organic solids (Ma et al., 2013). Therefore, to improve the degradation ratio of substrate and hydrogen production performance from PS, cellulose-degrading bacteria C. thermocellum was inoculated. The effect of inoculation with C. thermocellum on the hydrogen production from PS was elucidated in anaerobic batch experiments. The variation of hydrogen production and metabolites in broth for inoculation and non-inoculation processes with time is presented in Fig. 4 . As shown in Fig. 4a, the hydrogen production of inoculation group increased rapidly during the first 24 h and fluctuated slightly as time went on. The maximum hydrogen production was 133.68 ± 3.18 mM at 144 h for the inoculation group, and the pH values were measured between 5.77 and 7.20 due to the organic acid generated in the process, as shown in Fig. 4b. The maximum hydrogen production of non-inoculation group was only 65.79 mM at 168 h, which was much lower than inoculation group. Obviously, the inoculation of C. thermocellum significantly increased hydrogen formation rate. Similarly, an enriched cellulolytic bacterium named as Clostridium sp. TCW1 enhanced hydrogen production effectively in a two-stage biohydrogen and methane fermentation from vegetable-based kitchen waste and napiergrass (Kuo et al., 2012). The Gompertz equation coefficients for the two processes are presented in Table 1 . Maximum hydrogen production potentials and hydrogen formation rates were consistent with Fig. 4a. As shown in Table 1, the maximum cumulative hydrogen volume of 109.24 mL was calculated for inoculation process and the cumulative hydrogen for the control bottle was 52.68 mL H2. The maximum hydrogen production rate increased from 19.75 mL/L·h without inoculation to 142.25 mL/L·h after C. thermocellum inoculation, showing an increase of 6.2 times. The adaptation phase also decreased from 7.59 h to 3.89 h with the inoculation. Thus, the results showed that C. thermocellum efficiently improved bio-hydrogen production of PS, which was consistent with a previous study (Tsapekos et al., 2017). The hydrogen production yield of the inoculation process reached 110.91 ± 2.64 mL H2/g VS, a 96.80% increase compared with 56.38 ± 6.68 mL H2/g VS obtained in the non-inoculation process, which was line with the higher holocellulose degradation rate with inoculation. Our findings coincided with the results of Lu et al. (2009), who reported that higher cellulose hydrolysis ratio was achieved by the original anaerobic sludge augmented with C. thermocellum. As shown in Fig. 4b, butyrate was main metabolite in the broth of inoculation, as well as acetate, ethanol and a trace of formate and propionate (data not shown). However, the main metabolites in the broth of the non-inoculation process were acetate, butyrate, ethanol and propionate, with acetate and ethanol occupying a large proportion, which implied different metabolic pathway occurring in the two different processes. Hydrogen yield of 1.13 kJ/g VS and 0.55 kJ/g VS were obtained from inoculation and non-inoculation groups, respectively, showing an increase of 48.67%. The result clearly stated that C. thermocellum inoculation significantly improved energy recovery from PS. This result indicated that the hydrogen production is feasible from PS without pretreatment under the anaerobic fermentation of C. thermocellum inoculation and the native microorganisms. C. thermocellum inoculation remarkably enhanced the substrate utilization and hydrogen production, which laid the foundation for the management and value-added utilization (such as biorefinery) of biomass process. Also, a solution should be considered for the disposal of the effluent rich in organic acid and alcohol, such as methane production, which would help to better understand and judge the effectiveness of energy generation of the process. The total VOC (volatile organic compounds) generation from PS also increased from 7.58 g/L for non-inoculation group to 8.59 g/L for inoculation group. The higher total VOC recovery of C. thermocellum inoculation may be conductive to energy recovery for subsequent methane production from the effluent. Substrate degradation is an indicator of the waste disposal and digestion degree. Fig. 4d showed cellulose and hemicellulose degradation rate of the two processes. The cellulose and hemicellulose degradation rate of the inoculation process were 85.81% and 80.40%, respectively, which increased 41.93% and 11.51%, respectively, compared to those obtained in the non-inoculation process. The increasing cellulose degradation rate resulted from the hydrolysis function of C. thermocellum supplied. Similar results were reported in a very recent study of Ecem Öner et al. (2018). Based on the report, the decrement of cellulose in the residue increased 40% under the conditions of 20% (v/v) C. thermocellum addition during the investigation on bio-methane production in the anaerobic co-digestion of cow manure and wheat straw. The presence of highly cellulolytic microbes, such as C. thermocellum, was considered to play an important role in the cellulose degradation in the anaerobic digesters (Tsapekos et al., 2017). Similarly, Kuo et al. (2012) highlighted the role of Clostridium sp. during the bioaugmentation strategies that can improve the cellulose conversion efficiency."
12,Effect of substrate loading on the biodegradation of PS,"3.4 Effect of substrate loading on the biodegradation of PS To increase hydrogen production, the optimal initial substrate concentration was examined. Fermentable sugars (glucose, xylose and cellobiose) could not be accumulated during fermentation processes, indicating that the hydrolyzed sugars were quickly utilized by C. thermocellum and indigenous microbes for proliferation and production for hydrogen and by-products. The hydrogen production performance from different substrate concentration was shown in Fig. 5 . As can be seen from Fig. 5a, the hydrogen production increased with increasing substrate concentration and showed no significant difference between 7.4% and 9.3% (P < 0.05). The pH values of fermentation broth decreased with the increase of substrate concentration and maintained approximately 5.5 in the fermentation endpoint when the substrate concentrations were more than 7.4%. The butyrate production gradually increased as the substrate concentration rose, while other metabolites remained stable, such as acetate and ethanol, indicating that the metabolic pathway or dominant bacteria may be different under variable substrate concentrations. pH plays a very significant role in the microbial catalysis and growth of the bacteria, and the optimal pH for hydrogen production process varies among different species and strains (Zhong et al., 2015). For C. thermocellum, the optimal pH for hydrogen production was neutral pH (approx. 7.0) according to the report by Tian et al. (2015). The optimum pH was reported to be 7.5 for Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum DD32 in hydrogen production process from lignocellulose (Sheng et al., 2015) and 4.8–5.5 for anaerobic sludge digestion of dairy production wastes (Zhong et al., 2015). Different pH ranges may result in different metabolic pathways in the complex anaerobic fermentation process. At the start of the fermentation (pH 7.2), the hydrogen may be mainly generated from C. thermocellum. pH value decreased with the organic acids generated as the fermentation proceeded, where C. thermocellum may be no longer play a leading role. A low pH can affect hydrogenase activity and the metabolic pathway of microorganisms. Besides, the extracellular environment with more H+ selected bacteria that can survive at lower pH range, and at the same time suppressed or killed other organisms that cannot tolerate. This may be the reason why hydrogen production didn’t increase when substrate concentration was over 7.4%, but more butyrate was generated. It was reported that there is no butyrate produced in the fermentation process by C. thermocellum (Lin et al., 2017), while the increase of butyrate concentration at high substrate loading suggested that other bacteria might play an indispensible role in the fermentation process. The hydrogen yields were 99.90 mL/g VS, 98.05 mL/g VS and 81.83 mL/g VS of the three substrate loading, 5.4%, 7.4% and 9.3%, respectively. For higher hydrogen production and yield, it can be concluded that the optimal substrate concentration was 7.4% for the hydrogen production from PS by C. thermocellum inoculation. Furthermore, a study for a suitable and feasible pH-control strategy is needed to enhance the hydrogen production in the process and keep the stable population of C. thermocellum."
13,Conclusion,"The performance of hydrogen production from PS by anaerobic fermentation with its original microbes and the dynamic changes were studied. It was found that Ruminiclostridium and Thermoanaerobacterium genera played key role in substrate hydrolysis and hydrogen generation. C. thermocellum inoculation significantly improved hydrogen production and substrate degradation. Hydrogen production and yield of the inoculation process increased by 103.19% and 96.80%, respectively, compared to non-inoculation process. C. thermocellum represents a promising insight on anaerobic hydrogen production from PS, which providesanexampleof efficient hydrogen production from waste biomass."
