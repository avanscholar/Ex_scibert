0,Introduction,"Global energy demand, climate change, and environmental pollution caused by fossil fuel combustion have heightened the need for renewable energy sources for both developed and developing nations. In the last decade, approximately 83% of the growing global energy demand (estimated at 467 EJ) was derived from fossil fuels. Biomass energy is by far the most renewable alternative energy source with potential to be optimised for both fuels and co-products [1]. Liquid and gaseous fuels derived from lignocellulosic feedstocks via fermentation will help to curtail our dependence on fossil fuels for transportation and other purposes such as heat and power [2]. Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant organic material in nature with 10–50 billion tonnes annual worldwide production and in excess of 180 million tonnes of available cellulosic feedstock per year from agricultural resources [3,4]. Although a variety of fuels currently used can be produced from grains, current renewable fuel standards mandate a 96.4% increase in efficient and ‘advanced biofuels’, the majority of which can be derived from cellulosic biomass [5]. Unlike the corn ethanol industry, which faces many industrial challenges including the “food versus fuel debate” [6–8], cellulosic ethanol from biomass has a wide range and variety of feedstocks derived from forestry, agricultural, industrial and municipal sources. Examples of lignocellulosic materials being used as feedstocks for bioethanol production include different types of soft and hardwood, agricultural residues from food crops, such as corn stover and cereal straws, and dedicated lignocellulosic energy crops, i.e. switch grass, miscanthus, and short rotation trees, such as poplar and willow [9]. In this study, we have investigated the potential of using residues of industrial hemp, Canabis sativa, as substrate for bioethanol and biohydrogen production. As an industrial plant, hemp fibre has many applications in the textile industry. Hemp seeds are used for the production of neutraceuticals and food products, while the hurds and fibre have some paper and composite applications [10,11]. Crops that have been cultivated on a large scale like hemp offer great potential as feedstocks for biorefineries. Studies in Sweden have investigated the possibility of using hemp biomass for bioethanol and biogas production [12,13]. In the United States during 1920s, 25% of Standard oils sales in the Midwest were from the ethanol derived from hemp biomass [14]. As an energy crop, hemp biomass has the following advantages: i) Hemp can be grown on marginal land compared to other energy crops grown on agricultural land; ii) it requires little fertiliser, thus minimizing the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers; an essential factor for its Life cycle analysis or LCA as a feedstock; iii) Canabis sativa removes smaller amounts of nutrients from the soil compared with other crops, iv) hemp plants are resistant to pest and disease, v) it grows faster than other energy crops, and vi) produces higher energy yield per acre per year than corn, sugarcane, and flax [15–17]. Industrial hemp cultivation in Canada is viewed as a new alternative crop, which compliments prairie crop production rotations by breaking traditional crop cycles and increasing profits [11]. Thus, there is a growing interest for high volume local cultivation of the industrial hemp as a multifunctional industrial crop with a huge supply of residual biomass after cultivation and processing. The residues from hemp cultivation and decortication constitute a mixture of fragments of hemp fibre and hurds or hemp core. We investigated the bioprocessing of this rich source of cellulosic biomass in a one-step fermentation process otherwise known as consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) [18–24]. CBP combines cellulase production and substrate hydrolysis and fermentation of the hydrolysate (both hexose and pentose sugars) in one step, thus saving the cost of investing in a multi-step process [20,23–26]. Of all the reported technological advances to reduce processing cost, a single-step process offers the greatest potential of reducing bioethanol cost by 41% in the processing of biomass to ethanol [27]. A techno-economic evaluation of bioethanol from softwood (spruce), hardwood (salix) and an agricultural residue (corn stover) concluded that the process configuration had greater extent on the outcome compared to the choice of substrate [28]. We have investigated a single-step fermentation of purified hemp cellulose (PHC), hemp fibre (HF), and the hurds or core fraction of the residue (HH), against reagent grade α-cellulose (AC) for bioethanol and biohydrogen production using C. thermocellum in batch mode. Previous studies have shown that this gram-positive, thermophilic bacterium has great potential for effective bioconversion of low-value cellulosic feedstocks because of its ability to grow well on amorphous and crystalline cellulose [19,20,29–32]. In this study, the growth and end-product profile from using residues of industrial hemp cultivation and processing have been reported to elucidate the quality of hemp biomass as potential substrate for cellulosic biorefineries."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Substrates,"2.1 Substrates The hemp (Cannabis sativa) used in this study was obtained from the Emerson Hemp Distribution Company, Emerson, Manitoba, Canada. Residue from this industrial hemp is made up of the hemp fibres and hemp hurds. Some of the raw hemp residue was subjected to a thermochemical pretreatment (Organosolv®) process to solubilise hemicellulose and extract lignin. The biomass was pretreated with 50% ethanol, for 55 min, at 195 °C, using 1.5% acid as catalyst, at a 10:1 Liquid: Solid hemp biomass ratio [33,34]. We refer to this water insoluble substrate derived from the Lignols' Organosolv® pretreatment as purified hemp cellulose (PHC). We also separated the fibres in the raw hemp from the hurds to represent two substrate streams from a decortication facility rich in hemp fibres (HF) and hemp hurds (HH) as shown on Table 1 . All substrates were added to fermentation reactions at 2 g/L (20 mg). However, the amount of “available cellulose” in each substrate was different, because the amount of cellulose in each substrate was different. All test substrates (PHC, HF and HH in Table 1) were air dried and milled using a Retsch Rotor Beater mill SR200 equipped with a 34 mesh and 0.5 mm aperture sieve. All the milled samples were transferred into Ziplock bags and stored at room temperature. Alpha (α-) cellulose (C8002) obtained from Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, USA) was used as positive control. All test samples were over 93% TS. To test for substrate utilisation, a soluble fraction from raw hemp was obtained by autoclaving Balch tubes (27 mL; Bellco Glass Inc.,) containing 2 g/L (0.2% w/v) substrate concentrate of residual hemp biomass in 1191 and extracting the supernatant. The supernatant was used to test for growth of C. thermocellum on the soluble fraction derived from the substrate. The filtered supernatant was transferred into new tubes, sterilised by autoclaving and subjected to CBP with C. thermocellum. Negative controls were established using 1191 medium inoculated with C. thermocellum but without any substrate."
3,Microorganism and media,"2.2 Microorganism and media C. thermocellum strain 1237 was obtained from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (DSMZ; Braunschweig, Germany) and cultured in 1191 medium [35]. DSMZ 1237 is equivalent to C. thermocellum strain 27405 available at the America Type Culture Collection (ATCC). For each experiment, cells used for inoculation were cultured in a 1 L Corning bottle that was used to inoculate all batch reactors used in growth experiments to ensure reproducibility. All chemicals and reagents used were obtained from Fisher Scientific unless otherwise stated. Yeast extract was obtained from Biobasic Inc (bacteriological grade). Serial subcultures of C. thermocellum were used to prepare and maintain fresh cultures in 1191 media containing the 2 g/L α-cellulose. Per litre of milliQ water, 1191 medium contained KH2PO4, 1.5 g; Na2HPO4, 3.35 g; NH4Cl, 0.5 g; MgCl2.6H2O, 0.18 g; yeast extract, 2.0 g; resazurin from Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, USA (0.25 mg/mL), 2.0 mL; 10 × vitamin solution, 0.50 mL; 10 × mineral solution, 1.00 mL. Vitamin supplements and mineral elixir solution were prepared according to a previously described procedure in Islam et al. [35]."
4,Experimental design,"2.3 Experimental design Balch tubes and serum bottles (Wheaton Science, obtained from Fisher Scientific), with working volumes of 27 mL and 127 mL respectively, were used for all tests. Two grams per litre of substrate were used for the experiments performed in Balch tubes containing 9 mL of 1191 media. In order to maintain an anaerobic environment all the tubes were air-sealed with butyl-rubber stoppers and crimped with aluminium seals and then gassed and degassed for four (1:4) cycles with 100% nitrogen. Each tube was reduced with 0.1 mL of sterile 2 mM Na2S reducing solution [36] and then autoclaved. The same procedure was used with serum bottles but with a starting volume of 45 mL of 1191 media and 0.5 mL of 2 mM Na2S while varying the substrate concentration from 2 g/L to 4 and 8 g/L for HH. For each experimental set, batch cultures were inoculated from a single fresh growing 1 L culture bottle at exponential phase with 10% of the volume of media in test vessel. All batch experiments were conducted in three biological replicates. Triplicates of each experimental time point were collected for analyses according to predetermine time points interval of 3 h or more. Batch experiments were repeated 7 times with different time intervals. To determine the amount of end-products carried over into tests samples, zero hour time point were collected immediately after inoculation. Growth curve experiments were conducted in Balch tubes bottles while end-point tests were carried-out in serum bottles."
5,Analytical procedures,"2.4 Analytical procedures 2.4.1 Cell growth and pH measurements Cell-growth was determined based on protein analyses using the Bradford method [37]. Culture aliquots of 1 mL were sampled into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes (Fischer scientific) and centrifuge (Legend Micro21R, Sorvall) 10,000 × g for 10 min to separate the pellets from the supernatant. The supernatant were transferred to new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and stored at −20 °C for other end-product analyses. The pellets were resuspended in a 0.9% (wt/vol) sodium chloride (NaCl) and then centrifuge for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was decanted and 1 mL of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was added. The samples were vortex to re-suspend the pellet and boiled for 10 min in water to solubilize any remaining proteins. After cooling, the samples were later centrifuge at 10,000 × g for 5 min and the supernatants were collected for Bradford assay [37] using bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma Aldrich) as standards. Optical densities at 595 nm (Power Wave, XS, BIO-TEK) were measured after kinetic reads were stabilized and protein concentration was calculated based on the BSA standard curve with R 2 values >98%. A Beckman Coulter pH meter (pHi 410) equipped with a ThermoOrion triode probe was used to measure the pH of contents in each vessel. 2.4.2 End-product analyses and substrate consumption The concentration of soluble end-products was measured in the supernatant for each batch experiment. The concentration of ethanol in the supernatant of Balch tubes was measured using a UV-Test kit (R-Biopharm AG, Darmstadt, Germany). The amount of NADH produced by alcohol dehydrogenase measured spectophotometrically at 340 nm, was use to determine the ethanol content in the supernatant. Organic acids and ethanol for serum bottles were measured using a Waters HPLC system equipped with a Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87 column (300 × 7.8 mm) equipped with a refractive detector (Waters, 2414) at 45 °C, using 5 mM sulphuric as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. 2.4.3 Gas analyses Percentage gas production (H2 and CO2) was measured using an SRI gas chromatograph (SRI model instruments, Model 8610C) outfitted with a thermal conductivity detector, a stainless steel molecular sieve 13× packed column (3.2 mm × 1.8 m) connected in series with a stainless steel silica gel packed column (3.2 mm × 1.8) to separate H2 and CO2 respectively using Argon as carrier gas. Final gas compositions were quantified by correcting for temperature, pressure, volume and aqueous phase concentrations estimated according to the solubility of the gases in water [38]. The fraction of CO2 in equilibrium with bicarbonate was also taken in consideration [39]. 2.4.4 Dry mass measurements Dry mass was measured by emptying the entire contents of balch tubes unto pre-dried and weighed filter papers (Whatman #1) and the liquids extracted by vacuum extraction (Gas vacuum pumps DOA-704-AA). Filters where again dried at 105 °C using Isotemp Oven from Fisher scientific for 2 h after which the dry mass measured."
6,Results,
7,Cell growth characteristics,"3.1 Cell growth characteristics In our experiments, α-cellulose served as a standardized, reagent grade substrate with a known composition on a dry mass basis with negligible ash content as shown on Table 1. The hemp-derived substrates were dry-milled with a 0.5 mm sieve (34 mesh) screen to produce substrate particles with physical characteristics (surface area, degree of polymerization, and crystalinity [6]) similar to α-cellulose. It has been shown that further reduction of biomass particle size below 40 mesh (0.4 mm) had little effect on the rates and yields of biomass hydrolysis [40-41]. Initial experiments indicated that no biomass production was observed when C. thermocellum was grown on the soluble fraction extracted from hemp biomass (data not shown) therefore, subsequent experimental negative controls were established using 1191 medium plus inoculum. At a substrate concentration of 2 g/L, cell growth (based on total extracted protein) was observed after an initial lag of approximately 8 h (Fig. 1 ). Maximum protein concentration was reached when cells reached stationary phase typically after 60 h Fig. 1 shows the trend in biomass produced during growth on PHC, HH, HF and AC. Actual absorbance values translated to protein content were subject to substrate-specific differences in colour and crude protein. Minimal growth was observed in cultures containing 1191 medium without any substrate, and this growth was as a result of carryover from inoculums or due to the yeast extract in the 1191 medium."
8,Gas production,"3.2 Gas production Fig. 2 A and B show production of H2 and CO2, respectively, by C. thermocellum cultured on 2 g/L of each substrate (HH, HF, PHC, and AC) in 1191 medium. Gas production follows the growth patterns in Fig. 1. The initial production pattern is the same for all four substrates, but as growth proceeds into the early log phase, the rate of H2 and CO2 decreases significantly for the HH, while production rates of H2 and CO2 were comparable for AC, PHC and HF. A possible explanation for why the production rates are similar in the beginning is that they are most likely as result of carryover from the inoculums, which were cultured in 2 g/L of α-cellulose and also contained yeast extract. As expected, gas production tapered off as the cells entered stationary phase. Net and rates of production from the different substrates in Balch tubes have been stated in Table 2 while Fig. 3 shows the end-point concentrations of H2 and CO2 at 53 h in serum bottles (50.5 mL). Gas production, shown in Fig. 3, was highest for the reagent grade α-cellulose. Lower amounts of H2 and CO2 were produced from PHC, HF, and HHQ, while HHD and HH produced the lowest amounts. Data from six independently experiments were taken into consideration and three biological replicates were used each time to calculate the mean and standard deviation for each data point."
9,Soluble end-products,"3.3 Soluble end-products The major fermentation end-products produced by C. thermocellum growing on all four substrates were acetate, lactate, formate, and ethanol. While ethanol production maintains the same pattern as the growth curve perform in Balch tubes, Fig. 4 shows that the ethanol synthesis profile followed the cell growth patterns observed with from different feedstocks. Ethanol concentrations produced were similar for all substrates from 0 to 25 h until mid-log phase, when production increased for AC, PHC, and HF compared to HH. Net production of ethanol per volume of culture for AC (8.47 μmol/mL) was higher than that of PHC (6.56 μmol/mL), HF (5.48 μmol/mL), and HH (3.52 μmol/mL) (Table 2). Fig. 5 shows the fermentation end-point concentrations of ethanol, organic acids and the final pH at 53 h in serum bottles. A linear increase in the end-point ethanol concentration was observed as the loading of HH was increased from 2 g/L (HH) to 4 g/L (HHD) to 8 g/L (HHQ), and the end-point concentration of ethanol produced by HHQ was not significantly different from those of HF and PHC. Acetate and formate were the major organic acids produced, although low concentrations of lactate were observed at 53 h in all the fermentations reactions. Lower concentrations of acetate and formate were observed in HH compared to AC, PHC and HF. Organic acid production was lowest in the HH after 53 h. The final pH observed for HH (7.04), was higher than the final pHs observed for AC (6.41), PHC (6.58), and HF (6.62) (Table 3 ). The amount of substrate consumed by C. thermocellum in 10.1 mL Balch tube cultures. The amount of substrate consumed was calculated as the grams of substrate consumed = Initial substrate mass – mass of residue left after 70 h (including cells and substrate biomass). This analysis indicates that C. thermocellum consumed approximately the same amount of cellulose in the AC (0.017), HF (0.016), and PHF (0.014) substrates, but significantly less cellulose in the HH (0.006) substrate. The yield of end-products per gram cellulose of substrate, however, did not improve with the increase in cellulose content or concentration of HH (Table 3). The ratio of single-carbon (C1) to double-carbon (C2) end-products revealed the partitioning of carbon by C. thermocellum in the fermentation reactions (Table 3). The C1/C2 ratios ranged from 0.73 to 0.99 (Table 3) with more products/carbon accounted for with purified substrates (AC and PHC) than with unprocessed feedstocks, such as HF, HH, HHD and HHQ. However, the C1/C2 balances for HH, HHD, and HHQ suggest an overestimation of C2 products (acetate and ethanol) or underestimation of C1 products (carbon dioxide and formate). The O/R ratios for all substrates indicate that all oxidized and reduced end-products were accounted for (Table 3)."
10,Discussion,"Analyses of biomass polymer composition (conducted at the University of Saskatchewan, Feeds Innovation Institute, and reported on a dry mass basis) showed less available cellulose in HH compared to PHC, HF, and AC. Acid detergent fibre (ADF) was used to determine the portions of the biomass consisting of cellulose and lignin, while neutral detergent fibre (NDF) measured the total cell wall composition of the 3 major plant polymers: hemicelluloses, cellulose, and lignin. The difference between NDF and ADF represents the amount of hemicellulose, while ADF minus the lignin represents the approximate cellulose composition, expressed as percentage of the dry mass (Table 1). Substrate conversion by C. thermocellum is dependent on the binding of bacterial cells to cellulose fibres to effect hydrolysis and uptake [20,32], and thus cellulose accessibility becomes a rate determining factor [42,43]. This explains the slower growth rate of C. thermocellum on insoluble substrates relative to soluble substrates such as cellobiose observed previously [20,34]. Our data indicate that C. thermocellum generates as much cell biomass during growth on 2 g/L of PHC as on reagent grade AC (Fig. 1). Although the optical density measurements (A595) of the protein data (total protein extracted from cell biomass at each time point), as determined by Bradford assay was subject to substrate type, the yield of end-products (H2, CO2, and ethanol) confirm the growth differences of C. thermocellum on the different substrates. Significantly higher yields of fermentation end-products were observed in fermentation reactions with AC (purified reagent grade cellulose), PHC, and HF compared to HH. The growth of C. thermocellum on cellulosic substrates depends on the accessibility of its enzyme components to the cellulose in the biomass to produce cellodextrins that are transported across the cell membrane and metabolised to produce end products such as hydrogen, carbon dioxide, ethanol and organic acids [18–20,32]. Although the net amount of hydrogen and ethanol produced was highest for AC (Table 2), the rates sustained during the exponential phase were comparable AC and PHC for both hydrogen and ethanol compared to any other substrates. Organosolv pretreatment, generates purified cellulose fibres by precipitating lignin, solubilizing hemicelluloses, and extracting waxes and plant proteins [6,33,34,44]. The absence of these polymers in PHC creates more binding sites for the bacteria and their catalytic components. The cellulose content of PHC and HF were approximately equal (78.9% and 78.5%, respectively), while their hemicellulose (4.9% and 6.6%, respectively) and lignin (7.3% and 3.3%, respectively) contents were not greatly different (Table 1). The cellulose, contents of HH, however, was significantly lower (57.7%), and the hemicellulose and lignin contents were significantly higher (17.8% and 16.8%) than PHC and HF (Table 1). When cellulose is processed, it is converted from its native form in biomass (cellulose I) to a more amorphous polymorph (cellulose II–IV) [45]. Thus, pretreated biomass (in this case of AC and PHC) is more digestible than raw biomass (HF), even though they may have approximately the same cellulose content [6]. When experiments were carried-out in serum bottles, and the amount of dry mass measured for HH was double and quadrupled to investigate the effect of increasing cellulose concentration and accessibility on the yield of end-products. The production of ethanol and hydrogen increased significantly as the concentration of HH increased (Figs. 2–5). Doubling and quadrupling the concentration of HH to increase the available cellulose to levels that were greater (116 and 232 mg available cellulose in HHD and HHQ, respectively) than the cellulose available in AC (86.43 mg available cellulose), resulted in increases in end-product titres. However, no significant increase in the specific yields of ethanol and hydrogen per gram cellulose were observed for HHD and HHQ (Table 3). Moreover, although the cellulose concentration increased in HHD and HHQ, the final yield of hydrogen and ethanol did not equal the production observed with 2 g/L of AC and PHC, even though the available cellulose content was lower than in HHD and HHQ. Presumably, the specific yields of hydrogen and ethanol were limited because accessibility to the cellulose fibres was impaired by the presence of hemicellulose and lignin polymers in the substrate. Increasing the accessibility of HH by removing lignin, hemicelluloses, pectins and wax via pretreatment results in a cellulose fraction that is highly amorphous and accessible, producing higher yields as observed in PHC."
11,Conclusion,"We have established that the gram positive, cellulolytic bacterium, C. thermocellum is able to utilise processed and unprocessed residual fractions of hemp biomass derived from local hemp cultivation for hydrogen and ethanol production in a single-step process. Our findings have shown that purified hemp cellulose, derived as a by-product of the Lignol Organosolv® process, as well as raw cellulose rich hemp fibre, result in greater production of fermentation end-products compared with native hemp hurds in a consolidated bioprocess. End-product yields were based on their instrinsic cellulosic content as well as the presence of polymers present in plant biomass. Removal of lignin, hemicelluloses, pectins, and wax in PHC resulted in a highly reactive cellulose that can be used directly as feedstock for biological ethanol and hydrogen production in a one-step fermentation process."
