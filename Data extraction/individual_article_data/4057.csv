0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is not only an important raw material for chemical industries, but also a promising clean fuel for the next generation [1]. Since the elementary hydrogen rarely exists in nature, it has to be produced from a variety of hydrogen-containing compounds like hydrocarbons, water and biomass. Currently, fossil fuels or biomass steam reforming is still the most realistic and economical method for large volume hydrogen production [2]. The reformate hydrogen is usually mixed with byproduct gases such as CO, CO2, H2O or even H2S. In order to obtain high-purity H2 that is usually required in practical applications [3,4], a safe, low-cost and highly efficient separation and purification method is always required. Compared to the cryogenic distillation and pressure swing adsorption (PSA) which have been extensively applied as the state of art technology in industry for H2 separation, the membrane technology is a more economically effective method since no phase change is involved in the separation process if the H2-permselective membranes with high performance and low material cost can be achieved. Amongst various hydrogen selective membranes, metallic Pd-based membranes have been studied extensively due to their significant resistance at elevated temperature, high permeability and selectivity towards hydrogen and good mechanical strength [5–12]. However, the Pd-based membranes also have the unavoidable shortcomings such as high price of precious metal palladium, susceptibility to damage by CO and sulfur contaminants and coking, and hydrogen embrittlement as a consequence of the phase transition caused by cycling at different temperatures or hydrogen pressures [13,14]. On the other hand, the atomic inter-diffusion between the Pd membrane and the substrate usually occurs at high temperatures when porous stainless steel or nickel is used as the support, which deteriorates the membrane performance and lifetime [15]. Therefore, the Pd-based membranes are usually limited to the application at intermediate temperature regime (300–500 °C). Although an intermediate layer of metal oxide such as Al2O3, ZrO2, YSZ, CeO2, TiO2 or Fe2O3 can be employed as the diffusion barrier to improve the membrane stability, the processing complexity would increase the membrane cost and the metal oxide layer is easily peeling off from the metal substrate due to their different thermal coefficients when subjected to the cycles of cooling and heating [16]. Compared with the palladium, nickel-based membrane is superior due to its lower material cost and high stability to withstand the presence of CO and sulfur in the hydrogen-containing atmosphere at high temperatures [17–20]. Furthermore, the nickel membrane can be used in membrane reactors for reforming reaction without necessity to deposit an additional reforming catalyst since the membrane itself has catalytic activity [21–23]. However, the hydrogen permeability of the currently reported nickel membranes is much lower than the Pd-based membranes at similar operation temperatures as both the hydrogen solubility and the solid-phase diffusion coefficient in nickel are much lower than those in palladium. A strategy to improve the hydrogen flux of the nickel membranes is to reduce the membrane thickness by forming a composite or asymmetric structure. For instance, Ernst et al. [19] successfully prepared a nickel film of 1–1.5 µm in thickness on the asymmetric tubular alumina support by the electroless plating technique. The resultant Ni/ceramic composite membrane demonstrated an encouraging result of H2 flux up to 2.5 mmol m−2 s−1, which is close to the values reported for the Pd–based membranes operated at optimum conditions [6,7]. Another route to achieve high separation capability is to fabricate the membranes into hollow fibers to provide a very high membrane surface area per unit volume ratio [24–30]. The thin membrane thickness provided by the hollow fiber geometry, in particular, prepared by the phase inversion method, will endow the membrane with a super-high flux value in contrast with those conventional planar or tubular membranes [31,32]. All these features are important considerations for the portable H2-dependent power sources where the volume of hydrogen production or delivery system should be minimized [33,34]. Another incentive to develop hydrogen selective membranes with high thermal stability is the possible integration with these high temperature coal gasification or methane reforming reactors, which can significantly improve the plant efficiency for hydrogen production [35]. Such membranes can be applied as the membrane reactors to enhance the reactant conversion due to hydrogen extraction. In our previous publications, we reported the preparation and characterization of metallic nickel hollow fiber membranes with a very thin wall thickness by a dry-wet spinning and programmed sintering technique [36,37]. This work is mainly focused on the hydrogen separation performances of the Ni hollow fiber membranes in the gas atmosphere by mimicking the real applications, i.e., from reformate mixtures. Effects of the reformate components including CO2, CO, H2O and H2S on the H2 separation performances of the hollow fibers were extensively investigated. Hydrogen extraction from water gas shift reaction was also demonstrated. The thermal and chemical stability of the hollow fibers were also demonstrated by the multiple cycling operation and the long-term tests."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of metallic Ni hollow fiber membranes,"2.1 Preparation of metallic Ni hollow fiber membranes Nickel hollow fiber membranes were fabricated by a combined dry-wet phase inversion with programmed sintering technique [37,38]. The starting solution was composed of 65.4 wt% Ni powder with the average particle size of 1–1.5 µm and 99.9% purity supplied by Shenzhen Gem High-Tech Co. Ltd. (China), 6.7 wt% Polysulphone (PSf, Udel® P-3500, Solvay), and 27.9 wt% N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP: Electronic grade, Shandong Qingyun Changxin Chemical Science-Tech Co. Ltd. China). The solution was spun through a spinneret with the orifice/needle tube diameters of 3.0/1.5 mm into a tap water tank to form hollow fiber precursors, where the bore liquid flow rate and the air gap were set at 4 cm3 min−1 and 5 cm, respectively. The sintering was started with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 to 600 °C, dwelling for 1 h to burn out the organics in the fiber. With a 50 mol% H2-N2 mixture introduced into the furnace tube, the furnace temperature was raised at a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 to 1200 °C, dwelling for 3 h to obtain gastight hollow fibers. The sintering was completed by cooling down to room temperature at 3 °C min−1 in the H2-containing atmosphere."
3,Hydrogen separation from reformate mixtures and membrane reactor for the WGS reaction,"2.2 Hydrogen separation from reformate mixtures and membrane reactor for the WGS reaction A permeation cell was assembled with gastight Ni hollow fibers of about 25 cm in length for hydrogen separation, as schematically shown in Fig. 1. The Ni hollow fibers were connected to two quartz tubes on both ends, where a high-temperature silicone sealant (1592 High Temperature Silicone, purchased from Tonsan New Materials and Technol Co., Beijing, China) that is able to withstand up to 350 °C was used to seal the joints. The fiber was housed in a Φ10 × 400 mm quartz tube with two PTFE vessel covers on both ends. A tubular furnace of 23 cm in overall length was used for heating so that the sealing points were kept out of the hot zone of the furnace. The effective heating length of the furnace was 5 cm. In operation, the mixture of H2 and CO balanced with N2 passed through a humidifier and mixed with CO2 was fed to the fiber lumen while He (or N2) as the sweep gas was flowing co-currently in the shell side to collect the permeated H2. The gas flow rates were controlled by mass flow controllers and measured with a soap bubble flow meter. The water vapor content was modulated by adjusting the heating temperature of the humidifier. In order to test the poisoning effect of H2S, a N2 stream containing 200 ppmV H2S was mixed with the hydrogen feed. Compositions of the permeate and the retentate streams were measured using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890 N) fitted with a 5 Å molecular sieve column (3 mm diameter and 3 m length) and a TCD detector. Highly pure argon was used as the GC carrier gas and the flow rate was controlled at 20 cm3 min−1. Since no leakage was observed in the separation process, the hydrogen permeation flux and recovery were calculated by, (1) J H 2 = F e y e A m (2) R H 2 = F e y e F i n x f , H 2 × 100 % where F in and F e (mol s−1) are the flow rates of the feed mixture and the permeate effluent, respectively; x f and y e are hydrogen molar fractions in the feed and the permeate, respectively; A m is the membrane permeation area calculated by A m = π ( D o − D i n ) L / ln ( D o / D i n ) , in which D o , D in and L are the outer diameter, inner diameter and the effective fiber length for hydrogen permeation, respectively. In this work, values of D in and D o were obtained from scanning electron microscopy images and L was taken as the effective heating length of the furnace (5 cm). The CO and CO2 conversions were calculated by, (3) X i = ( 1 − F o u t x o , i F i n x f , i ) × 100 % ( i = CO , CO 2 ) where F out (mol s−1) is the retentate flow rate; x f,i and x o,i are the molar fractions of species i (CO or CO2) in the feed and the retentate, respectively."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Morphology and microstructure of the hollow fiber membranes were observed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on HITACHI S-4800 (Japan). In order to obtain the SEM samples, the hollow fiber precursor was frozen and fractured inside liquid nitrogen into short sections with smooth break. The short sections were then sintered together with the hollow fibers at high temperature so that the sintered SEM samples would have the same cross-sectional morphology as the hollow fiber membranes. The SEM was also equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) (INCA, Oxford Instruments) for EDS mapping. EDS spectra were collected at a magnification of 1000X and the analyzed area per sample was about 0.04 mm2 (232 µm × 166 µm), corresponding to the largest area that the electron beam could raster over the sample surface. The analysis depth under our experimental settings was about 4 µm. Crystal phases of the hollow fibers were investigated with X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Ultimal III X-ray diffraction meter, Japan) using Cu-Kα radiation with λ of 0.15404 nm. The metallic Ni hollow fibers were cut into short sections and carefully aligned in a sample holder for XRD measurement. Continuous scan mode was used to collect 2θ data from 20° to 80° with a 0.02° sampling pitch and a 2° min−1 scan rate. The X-ray tube voltage and current were set at 40 kV and 30 mA, respectively. For comparison, XRD patterns of the nickel powders calcined at high temperatures were also measured and presented. The gas-tight property of the hollow fibers was confirmed by the nitrogen gas permeation test at room temperature. For a brief description, the hollow fiber for test with one end closed was glued on the open end into a stainless steel sample holder with epoxy resin. It was then assembled into the stainless steel testing tank connected to a nitrogen cylinder. The tank was initially filled with 0.3 MPa N2. After disconnecting to the nitrogen cylinder, the pressure in the tank would decline with time due to the N2 permeation through the hollow fiber. The gas-tightness was evaluated from the recorded pressure change with time. The details of the measurement was described elsewhere [39]. The apparent density of the hollow fiber membranes was measured by the Archimedes method using pure water as the testing medium."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of Ni hollow fiber membranes,"3.1 Characterization of Ni hollow fiber membranes The Ni hollow fiber membranes in this work were fabricated using the combined phase inversion and sintering technique from the starting mixture consisting of 65.4% Ni powder, 6.7% PES and 27.9% NMP (by weight). The final membrane was achieved by sintering at 1200 °C for 3 h with the photo and the SEM images shown in Fig. 2. The typical length of the Ni hollow fiber membranes is around 25 cm (Fig. 2a), while the outer/inner diameter of the Ni hollow fiber is 0.98/0.80 mm with the wall thickness around 0.09 mm (Fig. 2b). It should be mentioned that the dimensions of the hollow fiber membranes can be adjusted by changing the spinning conditions [36]. Despite the porosity observed from the magnified cross sectional area (marked by the red rings in Fig. 2c), there is no connected porosity of the resultant Ni hollow fibers, which displays the complete gas-tight property as confirmed by the leaking test. Fig. 2d & e show the inner and the outer surfaces without the existence of any micro-pores. The relative density of the hollow fibers, i.e. the ratio of the apparent density to theoretical density of the metallic nickel was measured to be 98.1%, which further demonstrates the compactness of the hollow fiber membranes. Fig. 2f shows the XRD patterns of the Ni powder and the sintered hollow fiber membranes before and after hydrogen permeation test. It can be seen that the cubic crystalline structure of the nickel powder (Fig. 2f1) symbolized by the characteristic peaks with respective 2θ angles at 44.48° (111), 51.83° (200) and 76.4° (220) has been well preserved after the heat-treatment and in the resultant hollow fiber membranes (Fig. 2f2 & f3). However, the characteristic peaks of the sintered hollow fiber shifted to the higher 2θ value with significantly reduced intensity. For example, the primary peak (111) at 44.48° of the raw nickel powder was shifted to 44.82° of the sintered hollow fiber. This can be ascribed to the re-crystallization phenomenon occurred during the high-temperature sintering process [38,40]. The XRD measurement on the powders calcined at different temperatures indicated that the re-crystallization occurs only after the temperature is higher than 900 °C. For instance, the primary (111) peak of the Ni powder calcined at 900 °C has shifted from 44.48° to 44.66°. After the hydrogen separation test, the characteristic peak further shifted to the right angle with lower intensity, as shown in the figure. Nevertheless, no extra peaks except for the Ni crystals appeared on the XRD pattern, indicating the pure Ni phase has been preserved well in the hollow fiber. It should be mentioned that the hollow fiber has undergone a three-week's permeation test before the XRD measurement, during which a reformate mixture containing 100 ppmV H2S as the feed gas had been applied for more than 120 h. This suggests that the Ni hollow fiber membrane possesses a high tolerance to H2S poisoning, which is also reflected by the stable hydrogen permeation flux as discussed shortly."
7,H2 separation from reformate mixtures using the Ni hollow fiber membranes,"3.2 H2 separation from reformate mixtures using the Ni hollow fiber membranes H2 permeation in the metallic nickel membranes follows a mechanism of dissociation of hydrogen molecules into atoms at the membrane surface in the feed side, diffusion of atomic hydrogen through the metal lattice, and the recombination of hydrogen atoms to form molecules at the membrane surface on the permeate side [5]. Similar to the hydrogen permeation through the Pd membranes, the H2 permeation flux of nickel membrane can also be described by the Sieverts’ equation [20]. The H2 permeation properties of Ni hollow fiber membranes were also investigated in our previous work [36]. Since the hollow fibers fabricated with different parameters may demonstrate a different permeation behavior, we firstly tested the H2 permeation fluxes through the Ni hollow fiber membrane using a 52.8% H2-He mixture as the feed and N2 as the sweep gas, with the results shown in Fig. 3. No helium was detected in the permeate gas, indicating the hollow fiber is completely dense and the permeation cell is free of leakage. As is expected, the hydrogen flux increases with increasing the permeation temperature or the sweeping gas flow rate due to the promoted kinetics or the enlarged driving force for hydrogen permeation. The theoretical fluxes calculated with the mathematical model previously developed for H2 permeation in the Ni hollow fiber membranes and the activation energy E a = 51.46 kJ mol−1 [36] are also plotted with the solid lines in the figure. It can be seen that all the experimental data are in good agreement with the modeling results. The activation energy for hydrogen permeation in the Ni hollow fiber membrane is noticeably higher than that in the Pd membranes (8–15 kJ mol−1) [41–43], indicating that the permeation flux through the Ni membranes can be remarkably improved by elevating temperature. When the H2-He feed was switched into a mixture containing 52.44 mol% H2, 1.23 mol% CO and 3.8 mol% water vapor balanced with N2, the H2 permeation fluxes at different sweeping flow rates were measured and plotted against temperature in Fig. 4(a). For comparison, the theoretical values predicted by the permeation model presented in our previous work [36] using the above H2 permeability expression are also presented with solid lines in the figure. As can be seen, the experimental fluxes are slightly higher than the modeling values with respect to the H2-He mixture feed. For example, the H2 flux at 1000 °C for the 52.44% H2-CO-H2O-N2 mixture feed was 18.57 mmol m−2 s−1, whereas it was only 17.27 mmol m−2 s−1 for the 52.8% H2-He mixture feed at the same sweeping flow rate (5.94 × 10−5 mol s−1). The promoted hydrogen permeation flux results from the increase of hydrogen concentration in the feed side by the water gas shift (WGS) reaction occurring at high temperature. (4) CO + H 2 O ⇔ CO 2 + H 2 , Δ H r 298 o = − 41 kJ mol − 1 The CO conversion at different sweeping flow rates is plotted against the temperature in Fig. 4(b). It can be seen that the CO conversion ranges between 1.3% and 5% depending on the temperature and the sweep gas flow rate. As the temperature increased from 400 to 700 °C, the CO conversion initially decreased from 3% to 1.3%. Further increasing the temperature from 700 to 1000 °C resulted in the increase of CO conversion from 1.3% to about 5%. This variation trend of CO conversion reflects the competition between the temperature elevation and the hydrogen permeation. Since the WGS is an exothermic reaction, increasing temperature may prohibit the CO conversion, whereas the hydrogen permeation shifted the WGS reaction to the forward direction. At lower temperatures (< 700 °C), the CO conversion is mainly determined by the reaction temperature but the promotion effect of hydrogen permeation is marginal. After the temperature was increased to above 700 °C, the hydrogen permeation through the Ni membrane became significant. As a result, the CO conversion increased with the increasing temperature at the higher temperature zone. With increasing the sweeping gas flow rate, more hydrogen is permeated through the membrane from the feed side, and thus a higher CO conversion can be achieved, as clearly shown in the Fig. 4b. Hydrogen separation from a model reformate mixture using the nickel hollow fiber membrane was performed under different temperatures and sweeping flow rates with the results presented in Figs. 5 and 6. Neither CO nor CO2 was detected in the permeate side, indicating that no defects were present in the membrane module and the Ni hollow fiber membrane possesses infinite permselectivity towards H2. Fig. 5 shows the hydrogen recovery as a function of temperature, where the model reformate feed had a composition of 51.82% H2, 0.76% CO, 21.48% CO2 and 3.8% H2O (water vapor) balanced with N2, and the feed flow rate was controlled at 2.23 × 10−5 mol s−1. As expected, the hydrogen recovery increased with the operating temperature and the sweep gas flow rate because the hydrogen permeation rate may be promoted by increasing either the operating temperature or the sweeping rate. However, the maximum hydrogen recovery was only 19.46% at 1000 °C or 15.64% at 950 °C using a sweeping rate of 5.94 × 10−5 mol s−1. This implies the membrane area for hydrogen recovery may be limited in this work. For example, if the membrane permeation area is doubled, the theoretical hydrogen recovery at 1000 °C can be promoted from 20.1% to 35.48%. Noteworthy is that the experimental hydrogen recovery is lower than the theoretical value operated at the same conditions as one portion of hydrogen was consumed by the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS) in the feed side, leading to a reduced driving force for hydrogen permeation. (5) CO 2 + H 2 ⇔ CO + H 2 O In order to predict experimental results more accurately, a mathematical model with the RWGS reaction taken into account should be developed, which requires an intensive study of the reaction kinetics over the Ni membranes. Fig. 6 shows the H2 permeation flux and recovery as a function of temperature under different H2 feed concentrations with a constant steam content (3.8%), where the flow rates of the hydrogen feed mixture and He sweep gas were fixed at 2.23 × 10−5 and 4.46 × 10−5 mol s−1, respectively. As anticipated, the hydrogen flux increased with the hydrogen feed concentration because a large hydrogen concentration gradient across the membrane was generated, leading to a high driving force for hydrogen permeation. However, the H2 recovery for a higher concentration feed is lower than that for a lower concentration feed. For example, the hydrogen recovery at 1000 °C was 19.75% for the 33.3% hydrogen feed, whereas it was only 14.16% for the 77.4% hydrogen feed. Again, the results indicate that the H2 flux and recovery are lower than the theoretical values due to the RWGS reaction (5) occurring in the feed side. It is noted that no methane was detected in the effluent stream during all the above experiments. This indicates that the Ni hollow fibers exhibit low catalytic activation towards the methanation reaction. In order to further demonstrate the membrane reactor behavior of the Ni hollow fibers, only CO and water vapor balanced with N2 was fed into the fiber lumen while He as the sweep gas was passed through the shell side. Fig. 7 shows the experimental results with the CO and water vapor feed concentrations of 2.3% CO and 3.8% H2O, respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 7A, H2 is produced in the feed side via the WGS reaction, and some hydrogen permeated through the Ni membrane into the shell side. The H2 concentrations in both the feed and the sweep sides increase with temperature since the WGS reaction rate and the H2 permeation kinetics are promoted as the temperature is increased. This also implies that the WGS reaction cannot reach the equilibrium state until the temperature is increased up to 1000 °C, as shown in Fig. 7B. The equilibrium conversion decreases with increasing temperature due to the exothermic property of the WGS reaction. For comparison purpose, the WGS reaction was also operated without sweep gas and the operation became a normal micro-tubular reactor. As observed from Fig. 7B, the CO conversion by the membrane reactor is higher than the normal tubular reactor as the equilibrium is shifted to the product side due to the hydrogen extraction, a favorable feature of the application of membrane reactors. Noteworthy is that the CO conversions in the membrane reactor may even surpass the equilibrium value when the temperature is raised to 950 °C or higher. For example, the CO conversion with the gas sweeping rate of 2.14 × 10−5 mol s−1 reached 63.75% at 950 °C, which is obviously higher than the corresponding equilibrium conversion, i.e. 59.86%, whereas it was only 55.31% at this temperature if no sweeping gas was used."
8,Stability of the Ni hollow fiber membrane in H2 separation,"3.3 Stability of the Ni hollow fiber membrane in H2 separation Membrane stability is an important factor for its applications in industrial processes. Fig. 8 shows the H2 permeation behavior of the Ni hollow fiber membrane in a heating-cooling cycling test with the 49.8% H2-He mixture as feed and N2 as the sweep gas. Ten operation cycles in total have been performed over an operating period of 80 h. In each cycle, the temperature was increased from 200 °C to 1000 °C, and then declined from 1000 °C to 200 °C with the heating or cooling rate of 6 °C min−1. The hydrogen permeation fluxes were measured between 200 °C and 1000 °C at an interval of 50 °C or 100 °C. It can be seen that the hydrogen permeation fluxes at a given temperature rarely changed over the whole operating period. For example, the hydrogen flux attained to around 13.2 mmol m−2 s−1 when the temperature was increased from 900 °C to 950 °C, and then returned to this value as the temperature was decreased from 1000 °C to 950 °C. This flux level could also be retained in every cycle of the permeation test. It indicates that the Ni hollow fiber membrane possesses a superior thermal stability in hydrogen permeation to the Pd-based membranes [44]. The long-term operation test was conducted at elevated temperatures on the Ni hollow fiber membranes with the results presented in Fig. 9. A model reformate mixture with the composition of 51.95% H2, 0.69% CO, 21.4% CO2, 3.8% H2O balanced with N2 was fed into the lumen of the membrane module at 2.24 × 10−5 mol s−1 flow rate while the He sweeping rate was set at 4.41 × 10−5 mol s−1 (Fiber A). It can be seen that the hydrogen permeation flux is maintained at around 9.7 mmol m−2 s−1 for 121 h and the change over the operating period is marginal. This indicates that the Ni hollow fiber membrane is quite stable in the CO, CO2 and H2O-containing atmospheres as observed previously [37]. Noted that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) may be one of the major poisons in real reformate mixtures to significantly reduce the Pd-based membrane performance for H2 separation [45,46], a small amount of H2S (100 ppmV) was added into the model reformate mixture. The operation was lasted for another 40 h and the hydrogen flux was monitored continuously. As can be seen, the hydrogen permeation flux was slightly increased to around 10.1 mmol m−2 s−1 although the H2 concentration in feed was lower than before. The slight increase in hydrogen permeation flux can be addressed to the lower CO2 concentration, i.e. 10% CO2 in feed. As a consequence, the H2 concentration on the upstream side may be actually higher than that with the higher CO2 feed concentration, which implies more hydrogen will be consumed by the RWGS reaction. Furthermore, unlike the Pd membranes, the hydrogen permeation flux was not reduced due to the presence of the H2S and also hardly changed with time over the operation period. After this operation, the reformate mixture feed was switched to a 50% H2-N2 mixture with the same flow rate. The hydrogen permeation flux was then increased to around 11.5 mmol m−2 s−1 because no hydrogen was consumed by the RWGS reaction. Again the flux was maintained at the same level for another 39 h. In order to further confirm the high tolerance of membrane to H2S poisoning, another nickel hollow fiber (B) was exposed to a 50% H2-He mixture containing 100 ppmV H2S at 950 °C for more than 120 h. As can be seen, the hydrogen permeation flux could still be retained at a stable value, i.e. 13.8 mmol m−2 s−1 (B-(I)). Such a flux value is equivalent to that with the 50% H2-N2 mixture feed without containing H2S (B-(II)). The significant resistance of the Ni hollow fiber to H2S poisoning suggests that the hydrogen permeation is mainly controlled by the atomic hydrogen diffusion in metal lattice but not by the hydrogen dissolution on the membrane surface [36]. This means that even with a diminished solubility due to H2S poisoning the permeation rate is not noticeably affected [47,48]. To this end, the Ni hollow fiber membrane has demonstrated excellent stability both in the reformate gas mixture and in the H2S-containing atmospheres. This makes the Ni hollow fibers an outstanding membrane candidate for hydrogen production from coal gasification, which is the most promising near-term technology for large scale hydrogen production [35]. It is well known that the Ni-based catalysts usually have a high thermodynamic potential for coke formation. When CO is contained in the feed mixture, carbon may be produced via the CO disproportionation reaction. However, no obvious coke formation was observed on the membrane outer surface (feed side) after the permeation test with the mixture of CO, CO2, H2 and water vapor as the feed. Note that carbon formation by the CO disproportionation generally occurs at below 700 °C [49], the carbon balances between the feed and the effluent for the runs at 400–750 °C were performed to evaluate the possible carbon deposition on the membrane surface. It was found that the calculated gross carbon from the CO and CO2 contents was lessened only by 0.2–3%. Fig. 10 shows the SEM images (a-c) and EDS mapping (d-e) of the outer surface (feed side) of the hollow fibers after the separation test. The comparison of the SEM images (a & b) before and after test also indicates that carbon was rarely formed on the outer surface of the hollow fibers. The carbon detected might come from the residue of the pyrolysis of organics during the sintering process and the carbon produced via the CO disproportionation reaction. EDS elemental analysis shows that the carbon content in the fresh membrane is 3.70 wt% whereas it increases to 5.92 wt% after the long-term test. Therefore, the carbon produced by the CO disproportionation reaction is minimal, which has already been confirmed by the carbon balance calculation. It is also reflected by the EDS mapping which displays that carbon and oxygen atoms are well-distributed in the hollow fiber. Similarly, only a slight change was observed on the hollow fiber surface after feeding the reformate gas containing 100 ppmV H2S at 950 °C for more than 120 h (Fig. 10c) compared to the original hollow fiber surface (Fig. 10a). In general, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can react with nickel into sulfides like Ni3S2 on the nickel surface [50]. However, no sulfides were detected by the EDS elemental measurement possibly because the smooth Ni membrane surface has limited reactivity with H2S and the amount of surface sulfides generated over the period of 160 h is less than detectable. It should be mentioned that the formation of sulfides or sulphur-containing compounds cannot be excluded for the Ni hollow fiber membranes over a longer-term operation."
9,Conclusions,"Metallic Ni hollow fiber membranes with thin wall thickness and optimized microstructure were fabricated by the dry-wet spinning and sintering technique. The prepared Ni hollow fibers possess a high H2 permeability and 100% H2-permselectivity, which only allow for hydrogen permeation at elevated temperatures. The hydrogen recovery from reformate mixtures may be noticeably influenced by the water gas shift reaction occurring in the presence of CO, CO2 and H2O (vapor). The Ni hollow fiber membranes also demonstrate good cycling operation performance and high resistance to CO, CO2, H2O and H2S poisoning at high temperatures. The excellent thermal and chemical stability as well as the high permeation performance endow the Ni hollow fiber membranes great potentials in advanced applications such as the portable devices for hydrogen delivery or the integration with hydrogen production from coal gasification or methane reformers to improve the plant efficiency, which is the most promising and realistic near-term technology for large scale hydrogen production."
