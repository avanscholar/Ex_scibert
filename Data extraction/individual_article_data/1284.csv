0,Introduction,"Furfural has been produced from lignocellulose through chemical and thermal treatment [1,2]. Therefore, it is a useful potentially platform molecule in biorefinery processes to produce a plethora of renewable origin chemicals and biofuels [3]. Among the several routes to converting furfural to more value-added products, their oxidation in gas or liquid phase has attracted a lot attention [4,5]. Green oxidants such as molecular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide have been used due to environmental and economic reasons [6–8]. Industrially, furfural oxidation has been carried out via Cannizzaro reactions with NaOH, a homogenous process [9]. Alternatively, different processes to oxidize furfural have been developed, where ionic liquids, biphasic systems, organocatalysts, homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts are present [10–14]. Molecular oxygen is an oxidant very used in reactions to converting furfural to derivatives using mainly supported solid transition metal as catalysts in superior alcohol solution [15,16]. Furfural has been also oxidized by molecular oxygen to maleic acid or anhydride, which are valuable compounds to fine chemical and pharmacy industries, over molybdenum and or vanadium solid catalysts [17,18]. However, besides being a flammable oxidant, high pressures of oxygen, temperatures, additives, and noble metal catalysts are sometimes required to perform the reactions [19–21]. On the other hand, hydrogen peroxide is an inexpensive oxidant and desirable in terms of atom economy, availability, and therefore it is particularly attractive and safe for industrial processes [22]. Nonetheless, it is always requiring the presence of a metal catalyst to activate the hydrogen peroxide. In this regard, titanium silicate demonstrated to be an efficient catalyst to convert furfural to maleic acid in oxidations with hydrogen peroxide in the aqueous phase [23,24]. However, a long reaction time (ca. > 24 h) was necessary to achieve high conversions and selectivity. Another strategy used is to perform the furfural oxidations in the presence of organic acids such as acetic acid, generating peracids which are the true terminal oxidants [25]. A lot of attention has been dedicated to developing oxidation processes of the furfural to their acyclic dicarboxylic acid derivatives over heterogeneous catalysts (i.e., succinic, and maleic acids), which are highly valuable chemicals [23,25,26]. Nonetheless, not always a high carbon efficiency has been achieved, mainly due to polymerization of the substrate. The use of co-catalysts in a biphasic system can reduce this effect [13]. On the other hand, alkyl furoates are derivatives blendable to the liquid fuels that can be produced through oxidative esterification of furfural with alkyl alcohols, in solid-catalyzed processes, such as supported Au nanoparticles [27,28]. Production at large scale of alkyl furoates starting from xyloses present in biomass residues may make these products attractive and economically viable for fine chemical industries [29]. In this regard, the oxidative esterification in one pot is an attractive alternative to the traditional processes that employ metal salts as stoichiometric oxidant and sulfuric acid as the catalyst [30]. Keggin heteropolyacids (HPAs) are a versatile class of metal-oxygen clusters active in acid-catalyzed or oxidations reactions [31,32]. Vanadium-Molybdenum heteropolyacids were successfully used as the catalysts in aerobic oxidations of 5-hydroxymethyl furfural to maleic acid and anhydride [33]. However, HPAs are soluble in a polar solvent, hampering their reuse. The conversion of HPAs to insoluble salts has been an approach that overcomes this drawback [34]. In addition, when the saturated heteropolyanion (i.e., PW12O40 3−, SiW12O40 4-) are converted to the lacunar anion (i.e., PW11O39 6−, SiW11O39 7−), these compounds become catalysts highly active in oxidations with hydrogen peroxide [35–39]. Another modification on the Keggin HPAs composition that has been successfully performed is their conversion to salts, where the acidic protons are partially or totally exchanged by metal cations [40]. This is an effective strategy mainly if the metal cation itself has demonstrated to be catalytically active; this is the case of Tin(II) cations, which were very active catalysts in esterification and etherification reactions [41–43]. Metal transition exchanged HPA salts were efficient catalysts in acetalization reactions of the glycerol with HOAc, mainly the Fe4/3SiW12O40 salt [44]. Moreover, Al4/3SiW12O40 salts were efficient catalysts in oxidation reactions of camphene with hydrogen peroxide [45]. In this work, we synthesized a series of metal silicotungstate salts (i.e., M4/nSiW12O40; Mn+ = Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Al3+, and Fe3+) and evaluating their catalytic activity in furfural oxidation reactions with hydrogen peroxide in alcohol solutions. No organic acid was used as co-oxidant. Different than other oxidation processes of furfural, the main reactions were obtained without opening of the furan ring [24–26,46]. The impacts of the main reaction variables were assessed. Furfuryl acid and their alkyl esters were selectively obtained."

3,Synthesis of transition metal exchanged Keggin heteropolyacid salts,"2.2 Synthesis of transition metal exchanged Keggin heteropolyacid salts The syntheses of the transition metal exchanged heteropoly salts were performed through metathesis of the silicotungstic acid with a diluted solution of the metal chlorides as already described the literature [47]. Typically, a solution of H4SiW12O40 (ca. 1 g) was dissolved in water (30 mL) and heated to 333 K with constant magnetic stirring. To this solution was slowly added drop to drop another solution containing metal chloride in stoichiometric amount. The resulting solution was stirred and heating to 333 K/ 3 h. Afterward, the solution was evaporated releasing HCl and giving the solid salt, which was dried at 383 K/ 3 h."
4,Characterization of the catalysts,"2.3 Characterization of the catalysts The infrared spectra (FT-IR/ ATR) were recorded on Varian 660-IR spectrometer 660-IR model Fourier transformed infrared coupled to the attenuated total reflectance technique. The patterns of X-rays diffraction (XRD) of the salts were analyzed using a XRD-ray Diffraction System model D8-Discover Bruker using Ni filtered Cu-kα radiation (λ =1.5418 Å), working at 40 kV and 40 mA, with a counting time 1.0 s in the diffraction angle (2θ) ranging from 5 to 80 degrees. Crystallite sizes were calculated using the Scherrer equation: (1) L = K . λ β . c o s θ Where λ is the X-ray wavelength in nanometer (nm), β is the peak width of the diffraction peak profile at half maximum height resulting from small crystallite size in radians, and K is a constant related to crystallite shape, normally taken as 0.89. The porosity properties of the catalysts were evaluated by H2 adsorption/ desorption isotherms in a NOVA 1200e High Speed, automated surface area and pore size analyzer Quantachrome instrument. Before the analysis, the samples were degassed by 5 h. The surface area was calculated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller equation applied to the isotherms. Catalyst acidity was estimated by potentiometric titration, as described in the literature [48]. The electrode potential variation was measured with a potentiometer (i.e. Bel, model W3B). Typically, 50 mg of the salt was dissolved in CH3CN, magnetically stirred by 3 h and then titrated with n-butylamine solution in toluene (ca. 0.025 mol L−1). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images acquired in a JEOL JSM-6010/LA microscope. An energy dispersive spectrometry system (EDS) was used to analyze the chemical composition of catalysts. SEM images and EDS spectra were recorded using 10 mm working distance and 20 KV acceleration voltage. Thermal analyses were carried out in a Perkin Elmer Simultaneous Thermal Analyzer (STA) 6000. Typically, a sample (ca. 10 mg) was heated at a rate of 10 K/ min under N2 flow. Temperature range of TG curves was 303–973 K."
5,Catalytic runs,"2.4 Catalytic runs The catalytic reactions were carried out in a 25 mL three-necked glass flask, fitted with a sampling system and a reflux condenser. Typically, furfural (2.5 mmol) was solved in CH3OH solution (ca. 10 mL), magnetically stirred and heated to 323 K. After to add the catalyst (ca. 1.0 mol %, 25.0 μmol) and hydrogen peroxide (5.0 mmol), the reaction was started and monitored during 1 h through GC analyses (Shimadzu 2010, FID, Carbowax column) of aliquots periodically collected. The profile of temperature was as follows: 80 °C min−1, 10 °C min−1 up to 210 °C, hold time of 13 min. Temperatures of the injector and detector were 250 °C. Conversion and selectivity were calculated by matching of GC peaks of compounds into respective calibration curves. Dodecane was the internal standard. The main reaction products were identified by mass spectrometry analysis in GC–MS Shimadzu ultra mass spectrometer operating in an electronic impact mode at 70 eV. The oligomers were quantified through mass balance of reactions, comparing the sum of the GC peak areas of the products with the GC peak area of the furfural consumed (Equation 1). (1) % oligomers = ((A0 – Ai) − ∑Ap) × 100 Where: A0 = GC peak area of furfural (time = t0); Ai = GC peak area of furfural (time = t); ∑Ap = total sum of GC peak areas of the products after the correction by the response factor, which was determined comparing the GC peak of the pure products with the GC peak of furfural at the same concentrations."
6,Recovery and reuse of the catalyst,"2.5 Recovery and reuse of the catalyst After the end of the reaction, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and 20 mL of water was added. The resulting mixture was three times extracted with ethyl acetate. The aqueous phase was evaporated under heating plate to near dryness and then dried at room conditions. The solid catalyst was weighted and reused in another catalytic run."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Synthesis and characterization of the catalysts,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization of the catalysts In general, the solid salt catalysts were synthesized with a high yield (Table 1 ). No recrystallization procedure was required. The infrared spectroscopy is a powerful tool to verify if the primary structure of the Keggin HPAs (i.e., heteropolyanion) remained intact after the protons exchange by metal cations. It could be confirmed because the typical absorption bands of the Keggin anion are located at region of 1700−400 cm−1. FT-IR/ATR spectra of silicotungstic acid and their transition metal salts were recorded and are presented in Fig. 1 . The main vibration bands of chemical bonds belonging to the silicotungstic anion were observed in the infrared spectra of precursor acid also noticed in the spectra of the transition metal salts. The asymmetric stretching (i.e., νas) and angular deformation (i.e., δ) of Si-O bonds were observed at 926 and 539 cm−1, respectively. The vibrations of tungsten-oxygen bonds generated bands at following wavenumbers: 980 cm−1 νas (W = Od), 910 cm−1 νas (W-Ob-W), and 762 cm−1 νas (W-Oc-W). The subscript in the oxygen atoms distinguish them in relation to the place occupied in the heteropolyanion; Oa is the oxygen atom linked to the silicon atom; Ob are those oxygen atoms belonging to the WO6 octahedral units sharing corners; Oc are the oxygen atoms in edges and Od are terminal oxygen atoms bonded to the tungsten atoms [49]. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the silicotungstic acid and their metal salts. The main peaks were placed within region 2θ of 5–40 degrees. The parent H4SiW12O40 exhibited all markers of a typical X-ray diffractogram of a body-centered cubic secondary structure of Keggin anion, with characteristic diffraction peaks at angles 9.5, and 26.0 [50]. The profile of the diffractograms obtained from salts of Cu(II), Ni(II), Co(II) and Fe(III) were like the pristine acid. However, different than other salts, Al(III) silicotungstate have no diffraction peaks in the range of 10−20 2θ. The XRD patterns of the Keggin HPAs are related to the secondary structure of these solids, which is affected by the presence of water molecules and H+ cations; in general, the HPAs have hydrated protons as dihydronium cations (i.e., H5O2 +), which are coordinated simultaneously to the four terminal oxygen atoms of the heteropolyanions [51]. When the HPAs are converted to metal salts, the presence of these cations may be led to changes in the packaging of the anions and consequently, new lines diffraction or shift of peaks may occur, due to contraction of unit cell [52,53]. Through the Scherrer equation, the crystallite sizes were estimated (Table 1SM). While the silicotungstic acid had crystallite size of 26 nm, the metal salts presented equal or higher values, which ranged from 26 (i.e., Al4/3SiW12O40) to 42 nm (i.e., Fe4/3SiW12O40). Only the Cu2SiW12O40 salt presented a crystallite size lower than pristine acid (ca. 13.5 nm). To assess the effect of the protons exchange on the thermal stability of the catalysts, TG/DTG curves of silicotungstic acid and their metal salts were obtained (Fig. 1SM). In the TG/DTG curves of H4SiW12O40 and their salts, the weight at temperatures of 323 K–473 K was assigned to the eliminating of crystallization or physiosorbed water molecules [54]. The total number of water molecules varied from 7 to 12 mol H2O/ mol catalyst (Table 2SM). At temperatures between 473 and 673 K, the constitutional waters loss giving the SiW12O38 oxides and monometallic oxides [55]. The complete decomposition of the heteropolyanion, without a noticeable weight loss occurred at temperatures higher than 773 K [56]. Fig. 3 shows the physical adsorption/desorption isotherms of N2 and Fig. 3SM the pore diameter distributions of the silicotungstic acid and the metal salts. According to IUPAC recommendations, the isotherms of the synthesized salts can be classified as type as being intermediate between Type III and V. The isotherms of some catalysts (i.e., H4SiW12O40, Cu2SiW12O40 and Fe4/3SiW12O40) presented a noticeable type H3 hysteresis loop, which is assigned to the capillarity condensation in mesopores solids due to adsorption on aggregates of platy particles [57]. Table 2 shows the results of the texture parameters of the silicotungstic acid and their metal exchanged salts. The H4SiW12O40 has a very low surface area (ca. 4.1 m2 g−1), however, the introduction of metal cations slightly increased the surface area from 8.8–10.7 m2 g−1, excepted in the case of iron salt (ca. 5.1 m2 g−1). The pore volume of the metal salts was higher than that of the precursor acid (ca. 0.8–1.6 × 10−2 m3 g−1 versus 0.6 × 10−2 m3 g−1). Nonetheless, the Ni2SiW12O40 salt had the lowest pore volume (ca. 0.6 × 10−2 m3 g−1). The pore sizes of metal silicotungstate showing values lower than H4SiW12O40; while the pore diameter of the acid was 3.8 nm, the salts presented pore ranging from 3.1−3. 6 nm, confirming that both acid and salts are mesoporous solids (i.e., mesoporous solids between 2 and 50 nm). These porosity and isothermal adsorption characteristics for heteropoly salts are in accordance to the literature [44,45]. According to the pore diameter distribution curve profiles, the silicotungstic acid and their metal salts presented diameters in the range of mesoporous (Fig. 3SM). Most of the particles presented medium diameter of 3–4 nm, with maximum pore volume of 7 × 10−5 cm3 nm−1 g−1. The total acidity strength of the silicotungstate catalysts was determined by potentiometric titration using n-butylamine (Fig. 4 ). The initial electrode potential (Ei) allows to classify the strength of acid sites as very strong (Ei > 100 mV), strong (0 < Ei < 100 mV), weak Ei < 0 mV) and very weak (Ei < −100 mV) [58]. The acidic sites of all the catalysts were classified as very strong, similarly to the acidic sites of the pristine silicotungstic acid (Fig. 4). The acidity strength of the metal salts was as follow; Ni2SiW12O40 < Co2SiW12O40 < Al4/3SiW12O40 < Cu2SiW12O40 ≅ Fe4/3SiW12O40. Although this technique allows determining the total acidity (i.e., Lewis and or Brønsted acid sites), the tendency observed in titration curves of the heteropoly salts obeyed the Lewis acidity of metal cations. The profile of the titration curves of the metal silicotungstate salts was different than titration curves of silicotungstic acid. In general, lower volumes of n-butylamine were required to reach the equivalence point, which are gave by the inflection points observed in the titration curves. The presence of more than one plateau suggests that sites with different strengths are present. The value from which the plateau is attained (meq amine/g salt) indicates the total number of acid sites present in the titrated solid. The number of acidic sites for the silicotungstic acid was 1.35 mEq n-butylamine/ g catalyst. The amount of acid sites presents in the heteropoly salts increase as follows: Co2SiW12O40 < Ni2SiW12O40 < Al4/3SiW12O40 ≅ Cu2SiW12O40 < Fe4/3SiW12O40. The sites acid determined by this technique can be Brønsted and/or Lewis type. Analysis of infrared spectroscopy of the metal exchanged HPA salts, adsorbing pyridine or NH3 demonstrated that they have both types of sites acid [58]. Those authors proposed that, for the neutral salts (i.e., copper and aluminum, silicon(or phospho)tungstate), the Brønsted type acidity is due to the formation of H+ ions by dissociation of water molecules coordinated to the metallic cation. In a previous work, we have confirmed the stoichiometric composition of these metal salts by ICP analyses [45]. Herein, the elemental composition of the silicotungstic catalysts was confirmed through EDS analysis (Fig. 3SM). It was found that the elemental composition determined by EDS agree with the theoretical values expected, indicating a successful formation of the metal exchanged heteropoly catalysts. No traces of chloride ions, which were present in the precursor metal salt were detected. The EDS equipment was coupled to a microscope that provided the MEV images of catalyst surface (Fig. 4SM). The SEM images were obtained a with 2000 x magnifications for the H4SiW12O40 and their metal salts. The SEM images showed that the nickel heteropoly salt presented a lamellar structure with flakes having width of 10–40 microns and the other dimensions around to 100 microns. Regardless of the metal cation, the other salts show a grainy morphology with grains varying from less than 5 microns up to 50 microns. Therefore, we can conclude that the protons exchange by metal cations resulted in a significant alteration on the initial morphology of the silicotungstic acid."
9,Catalytic tests,"3.2 Catalytic tests 3.2.1 Effect of catalyst nature on the furfural oxidation with hydrogen peroxide in methyl alcohol solutions Initially, a screening aiming determine the most effective metal salt catalyst was performed using conditions previously described in another oxidation reactions [45]. Although excess of hydrogen peroxide (ca. 1:2), only a poor conversion was achieved in the absence of catalyst (ca. 5 %, Fig. 5 ). Regardless of the metal cation, all the reactions in the presence of heteropoly salt catalysts achieved the maximum conversion within the first 20 min of reaction (Fig. 4). Noticeably, the Cu2SiW12O40-catalyzed reaction reached the almost complete conversion at this time, while the other reactions had conversions ranging from 30 to 64 %. The furfural oxidation reaction may occur with or without rupture of the furan ring. For instance, maleic and or succinic acids have been products commonly obtained in reactions of oxidation over heterogeneous catalysts [18,46]. Conversely, the metal silicotungstate-catalyzed furfural oxidation reaction described herein provided products where the aromatic ring of furfural was preserved (Scheme 1 ). Furoic acid, methyl furoate ester, 2-furfuraldehyde-dimethyl acetal were the main products identified by GC–MS analyses. As described in the literature, in metal-catalyzed oxidation reactions with hydrogen peroxide the furfural can be also converted to products with a high molar weight (i.e., oligomers), which are not detectable in gas chromatography analysis. Herein, these products were quantified through the mass balance of reactions, comparing the sum of the GC peak areas of the products with the GC peak area of the furfural consumed (see Equation 1, experimental section). Fig. 6 shows the conversion and the reaction selectivity after 1 h reaction. When the reactions were carried without a metal silicotungstate catalyst, oligomers and acetal were the preferentially formed product. No oxidation product was detected. We have found that these two competitive reactions, condensation of furfural with methyl alcohol and oligomerization, compromised the selectivity of two goal-products (i.e., furoic acid and methyl furoate). The oligomerization is a very common reaction underwent by the furfural, which involve furan-based intermediates generated during the reaction. This reaction is favored either when peroxide intermediates and or H+ ions are present [59,60]. Similarly, the condensation furfural with alcohol is also promoted by H+ ions. These ions can be generated in the hydrolysis involving the water generated in the reaction and the Lewis acid metal cations [58,60]. It is noteworthy that the catalysts that were less efficient to oxidize furfural to furoic acid were those most effective to condensate furfural with methyl alcohol; indeed, the higher selectivity toward furfural acetal was achieved in reactions in the presence of Ni2SiW12O40, Co2SiW12O40 or Al4/3SiW12O40 catalysts (Fig. 6). Conversely, the reactions that achieved the greater selectivity toward furoate methyl, a product of the oxidative esterification of furfural, were carried out in the presence of the Fe4/3SiW12O40 or Cu2SiW12O40 catalyst. The reaction described herein is an attractive alternative to other processes to synthesize alkyl furoates, which involve supported Au nanoparticles catalysts, alkaline conditions, and high pressures of molecular oxygen [27,28,61]. The high efficiency of both metal silicotungstate catalysts (i.e., Fe4/3SiW12O40 and Cu2SiW12O40) may be assigned to the highest acidity exhibited by two catalysts (Fig. 4). We suppose that the Lewis and Brønsted acid characters of these catalysts are key aspects in the oxidation and esterification steps, respectively. Moreover, the results showed that in the presence of these catalysts, the furoic acid was almost converted to their ester. Several works have investigated the nature of acid sites (i.e., Lewis or Brønsted acid sites) using NH3-TPD measurements [62]. However, in the present case, our catalysts are soluble in methyl alcohol solution, and this technique looks few adequate to the solid catalysts. Nonetheless, it is important to highlight that both acid sites are present in the catalyst structure; while metal cations (i.e., Lewis acid site) react with hydration water or residual in the catalyst anion giving hydrated protons (Brønsted acid sites) [63]. Recently, we performed assessments on the acid sites nature of Sn(II) silicotungstate salt catalysts and confirmed that both types of acid sites remains in heteropoly salts of metal exchanged silicotungstic acid [64]. 3.2.2 Effect of load catalyst on the furfural oxidation with hydrogen peroxide in methyl alcohol solutions Once the Cu2SiW12O40 has demonstrated to be the most efficient catalyst it was selected to assess the effects of the main reaction parameters of esterification oxidative of furfural. To investigate the effect of catalyst load, the reactions were carried at the same previous conditions, varying only the load of Cu2SiW12O40. An increase in the catalyst load enhanced the reaction conversion only until 1.0 mol %; at higher loads, no beneficial effect was observed. Probably, the high load of the catalyst was more favorable to the oligomerization reactions, consequently diminishing the ester selectivity. Although not shown, this effect was verified using also catalyst load until 1.5 mol %. Another important question is that as the acetalization and esterification reactions are also dependent on catalyst load, mainly of H+ ions generated in solution, they were also impacted by the variation of catalyst concentration. However, in terms of ester selectivity, 0.75 mol % of catalyst load was the most effective. 3.2.3 Effect of H2O2 load on the Cu2SiW12O40-catalyzed furfural oxidation reactions in methyl alcohol Although the best catalyst load toward oxidative esterification of furfural has been ca. 0.75 mol %, we selected 1.0 mol % to assess the impact of the oxidant on this reaction, aiming make cleaner this effect (Fig. 7 ). At a molar ratio of furfural: oxidant higher than 1:2, no significant effect was observed in the reaction conversion, like the observed in products selectivity (Fig. 8 a and b, respectively). The usage of an equimolar amount of oxidant reduced either the furfural conversion as well as the ester selectivity. Expectedly, a lower load of oxidant compromised the oxidation reaction and consequently the furfural acetalization was more favored. Fig. 9 describes the shows that at the reaction conditions, a part of hydrogen peroxide is decomposed even in the absence of furfural or catalyst (Fig. 9b). Conversely, furfural was minimally converted when oxidant and catalyst were absent (Fig. 9a). When catalysts such as palladium salts are used in oxidation reactions with hydrogen peroxide, the oxidant is quickly decomposed, mainly in the absence of substrate [64]. However, in this case, there was only a small increase in consumption of peroxide when the copper silicotungstate was present. 3.2.4 Impacts of temperature on the Cu2SiW12O40-catalyzed furfural oxidation reactions in methyl alcohol The literature has described that furfural acetalization with methyl alcohol in the presence of Lewis or Bronsted acid catalysts proceed efficiently at room temperature [58,59]. Thus, we decided to verify if the oxidation reaction of furfural could have a similar behavior. Table 3 summarize the main results. An increase of temperature favored the furfural oxidation to furoic acid, which was almost completely converted to methyl furoate. At low temperatures, the oxidation was compromised and consequently the acetalization of furfural was enhanced. Although no shown herein, the kinetic and the selectivity of reaction was monitored collecting aliquots at regular time intervals (ca. 10 min). Regardless of reaction temperature, all the reactions achieved the maximum conversion within the first 30 min of reaction. No changes in the reaction selectivity where noticed after this period. 3.2.5 Cu2SiW12O40-catalyzed furfural oxidation reactions with hydrogen peroxide in alkyl alcohol solutions and in acetonitrile solution The steric hindrance on the hydroxyl group of the alcohol as well as the size of carbon chain are aspects that may affect their reactivity in esterification reactions. To investigate this effect, the oxidative esterification of furfural was also investigated in solutions of different alkyl alcohols (Fig. 10 ). In terms of conversion, the probable effects were verified; the reactivity of the alcohols was dependent of carbon chain size (i.e., methyl > ethyl > propyl > butyl alcohols) and isopropyl alcohol, a secondary alcohol was the less reactive. Conversely, the selectivity of products led to conclusion that when alcohols with lengthier carbon chains higher than methyl alcohol are present, there was a decrease in the selectivity of esters, and consequently the selectivity of furoic acid increase. The same effect occurred when isopropyl alcohol was the substrate. The oxidation of the furfural was carried also in acetonitrile solutions at the same reaction conditions used in Fig. 10. No conversion happened in the absence of catalyst. Conversely, a poor conversion was achieved in the presence of the Cu2SiW12O40 catalyst (ca. 14 %). Furoic acid was the only product detected. It is possible that as described in other oxidation reactions with tungsten catalysts, a protic solvent may favor the oxidation process stabilizing key reaction intermediates [65]. 3.2.6 Reuse and recycle of Cu2SiW12O40 catalyst in furfural oxidation reactions in methyl alcohol with hydrogen peroxide The Cu2SiW12O40 catalyst was reused as described in Section 2.5, which was previously optimized in previous works with furfural and methyl alcohol [59,60] (Fig. 11 ). After the solvent removal, water and ethyl acetate were added to the remaining neat; after has been washed three times, the aqueous phase was dried giving the solid catalyst. Fig. 10 summarizes the main results. High recovery rates of the catalyst were obtained, demonstrating the efficiency of recycling procedure. No significant decreasing in the conversion of furfural was noticed after the successive cycles of reuse. Although omitted in Fig. 10, the reaction selectivity was maintained constant while the catalyst was reused. Besides the recyclability, the copper silicotungstate catalyst has another relevant advantage; a comparison of TOF measured in the oxidation of furfural with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of different metal silicotungstate salts showed that Cu2SiW12O40 salt is a highly active catalyst (Table 3SM). Finally, we would like to highlight that a total understanding of the catalytic activity of metal silicotungstate salt certainly per pass by an investigation about how the introduction metal cations affect the redox potential of silicotungstic anion. Nonetheless, it requires theoretical and experimental studies, such as those performed by Zhang et al., which recently assessed the impacts of Pd, Pt or Rh single atoms on the activity of Keggin heteropolyacids in oxidation reactions [61,66,67]. However, this sort of investigation requires gas phase reactions, with model molecules, where the powerful spectroscopy techniques can provide insights on the catalyst structure and their interaction with reactants in situ."
10,Conclusion,"In this work, a series of metal exchanged silicotungstic acid salts were easily synthesized and evaluated in oxidative esterification reactions of the furfural with methyl alcohol using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. Among the metal silicotungstate salts tested, the Cu2SiW12O40 was the most active and selective toward methyl furoate, the goal product. Different than various processes described in the literature, in this route the furfural was selectively oxidized by aqueous H2O2 and converted to ester without opening the furan ring; furoic acid, alkyl furoate and 2-furfural dimethyl acetal were the products formed. Parameters such as the H2O2: furfural molar ratio, the catalyst amount, and the temperature have been studied. The reactivity of the furfural with other alkyl alcohols was also assessed. The high conversion and ester selectivity, the mild reaction conditions, the short reaction time, the use of an inexpensive, liquid, non-flammable, and an environmentally benign oxidant, besides a solid, easily synthesizable, and recyclable catalyst, are positive aspects of this process."
