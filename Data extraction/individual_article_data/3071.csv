0,Introduction,"Production of fuel from biological substrates is arguably one of the most important areas of energy research in recent history. There is tremendous potential in Canada for biofuel production from a variety of biomass sources. It has been estimated that the energy contained in biomass across the country is approximately 2.58pJ per year [1]. Taking into account the other fractions of waste, there is the potential that 456pJ are available from biogas production. Comparing this to a total energy usage of 7324.4pJ per year used in all sectors, it can be seen that biogas production could meet 16% of Canada's energy needs. However, not all biomass will be technically suitable or economically feasible for biogas production. It is important to identify and evaluate locally generated and available sources of waste biomass for their energy production potential. The use of hydrogen (H2) as a renewable fuel has been the focus of much discussion and research recently. Hydrogen has an energy yield 2.75 times greater than hydrocarbon based fuels and generates no detrimental emissions upon utilization [2]. Unlike its fossil fuel counterparts, H2 is not readily available in nature. Although there are several different methods of H2 production, biohydrogen from dark fermentation is unique in that it is able to utilize and treat a variety of waste streams. Biohydrogen production by dark fermentation, compared to alternatives such as bio-photolysis of water or photo fermentation, is advantageous because of its ability to produce H2 at higher rates. Non-biological methods of hydrogen production such as electrolysis and steam reformation of methane require extensive amounts of energy and also are a source of polluting emissions, such as CO2, CO, NO x and SO x . Fermentative hydrogen production can be carried out using various sources of carbon. Studies have evaluated hydrogen production from starch, cellobiose, sucrose, xylose, cellulose, lactose and delignified wood [17–19]. The goal is to move away from lab grade substrates and begin fermenting complex waste streams using specifically optimized and defined cultures to ferment raw naturally complex organic materials, especially insoluble substrates. Typically pre-hydrolysis is necessary in order to ferment cellulose based waste materials because most bacteria find soluble substrates much easier to digest [3,4]. In municipal wastewater treatment the degradation of insoluble constituents is often the rate-limiting step. This is also the case in biological hydrogen production. Clostridium thermocellum is a gram-positive, acetogenic, thermophilic, anaerobic bacterium, that degrades cellulose directly and carries out mixed product fermentation, synthesizing acetate, H2 and CO2, as well as lactate and ethanol under different growth conditions [5–8]. C. thermocellum expresses a suite of cellulolytic enzymes that are exported from the cell and assembled into a complex structure on the surface of the cell called a “cellulosome” [9,10]. The bacteria attach to cellulose particles via the cellulosome, and the enzymes within the cellulosome efficiently degrade the cellulose to glucose and cellulodextrans, which are transported into the cells for metabolism. Of all known cellulose degrading microorganisms, C. thermocellum displays the highest rate of cellulose degradation [8]. Because of its high rate of cellulose degradation and propensity to synthesize H2, carbon dioxide (CO2) and acetate, C. thermocellum offers the potential for directly producing H2 from cellulosic waste biomass. The optimal growth temperature of C. thermocellum, 60°C, reduces the chance of contamination by precluding the growth of predominant mesophilic microorganisms and allows for C. thermocellum enriched cultures to be maintained. However, this does not eliminate the need for sterilization of the incoming biomass for long-duration contentious cultures. Because solubility of gases decreases with higher temperatures, the higher growth temperature facilitates more efficient removal of product gases such as H2 and CO2. The objective of this research was to evaluate local sources of waste biomass for their hydrogen production potential using C. thermocellum. Three potential candidates were identified. Dried distillers grains with solids (DDGs), which is a co-product of grain based ethanol fermentation and is produced locally from wheat. Barley hulls (BH) and fusarium head blight (a crop fungus) contaminated barley hulls (CBH) are currently unused waste products resulting from crop processing and are abundant locally. De-hulling of fusarium-contaminated barley is being considered for removing toxins generated by the fungus, yielding a usable barley stream (for animal feeding applications) and an un-usable hull stream (requiring disposal or post-processing). When using C. thermocellum for cellulose based fermentation, a number of competing organic end-products may be produced (including ethanol, formate and lactate [11]). The purpose of this paper is to assess the degradability of the cellulosic wastes by C. thermocellum by determining the concentration of the various products generated from the fermentation under the conditions tested."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Media and substrates,"2.1 Media and substrates All chemicals used for media preparation and analytical procedures were reagent-grade and were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. and Fisher Scientific unless otherwise stated. The fusarium head blight contaminated barley hulls (CBH) and barley hulls (BH) came from Manitoba grown barley that was dehulled as part of a research project investigating the impact of de-hulling processes on fusarium related toxicity. The dried distillers grains with solids (DDGs) was wheat based, and also sourced locally (Husky Energy, Minnedosa, MB, Canada). The composition of the complex 1191 medium used in all experiments was previously described (Islam et al. [11]) and 5gL−1 of each substrate was added to balch tubes containing 10mL of 1191 medium."
3,Microorganism,"2.2 Microorganism C. thermocellum 27405 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and continuously cultured on cellulose for 800h in a fermentation reactor system. At approximately 300h of operation a visual change in color was observed in the reactor. This can be attributed to an increase in the concentration of cellulosome. At this time, a sample was taken from the reactor and inoculated into a serum bottle containing the alternative substrates."
4,Experimental design,"2.3 Experimental design Batch experiments were designed with three different substrates, with initial dry weight concentrations of 5gL−1. DDGs, CBH and BH were fermented in balch tubes (Bellco Glass Co.) with a working volume of 26ml. Each tube was air sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum seals. A control experiment was also carried out on 1.1 reagent-grade pure α-cellulose following the same procedure as described. They were reduced with 0.1ml of NaS solution after being gassed and degassed (1:4min) four times with 100% nitrogen according to the protocol described in Daniels et al. (1986). All batches were inoculated from freshly growing culture on 1191 medium in serum bottles (125ml) at exponential phase. Data points shown represent means of at least three independently replicated experiments."
5,Analytical procedures,"2.4 Analytical procedures Product gas composition (H2 and CO2) was measured using a gas chromatograph (SRI Instruments, Model 8610C) with argon as carrier gas and capable of detecting concentrations between 200–500ppm and equipped with a Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD). H2 analysis was conducted using a stainless steel (3.2mm×1.8m) column packed with a 13× molecular sieve while CO2 was analyzed using a stainless steel (3.2mm×1.8m) column packed with silica gel. Columns were arranged in a series and a temperature program ranged between 40°C and 120°C were used. Equilibrium concentrations of dissolved gases in aqueous phase were quantified according to procedures in Islam et al. [11]. Acetate, lactate and formate were measured using an IonPac AS11-HC anion-exchange column (Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Ethanol concentrations were determined using the Enzymatic BioAnalysis UV-Test Kit (R-Biopharm AG, Darmstadt, Germany) based on NAD+ produced by alcohol dehydrogenase, which was measured spectrophotometrically at 340nm. Standards for acids, sugars and ethanol were prepared on 1191 medium to correct for the background. Yields of H 2 ( Y H 2 ) , CO2, ethanol and organic acids were expressed as millimoles (mmol) of H2 produced per gram of substrate added in each tube."
6,Results,
7,Gas production,"3.1 Gas production Fig. 1 shows the gas production and pH drop of the cultures growing on DDG, CBH and BH. All three substrates produced similar amounts of gas, which was approximately 1/5 of the amount of hydrogen produced on the control of 1.1gL−1 α-cellulose over the same period of time. A drop in pH was observed within the exponential phase of the experiment (from 7.2 to 7.0). The drop in pH was much slower during stationary phase, reaching a final value of approximately 6.9 for all substrates (considering the standard deviation). The final pH for the α-cellulose experiment was somewhat lower than the alternative substrates at 6.7."
8,Acids and alcohol production,"3.2 Acids and alcohol production Acetate and ethanol were the major end-products of fermentation by C. thermocellum for all three substrates (Fig. 2 ). Formate was also produced in small amounts in each substrate. Lactate production was measured in BH and CBH, but was not produced in DDGs. In the exponential phase, the rate of acetate production was 10 fold higher to that of formate in DDGs. There was no significant production of formate in the exponential phase for CBH and BH. The rate of ethanol production was lower in all cases compared to acetate. The highest rate of ethanol production occurred in the CBH."
9,Yields and rates,"3.3 Yields and rates Yields and ratios of H2/CO2 calculated based on the total measured gas produced for each substrate are presented in Table 1 . The differences in H2/CO2 ratios were not substantial, varying from 0.9 to 1.15. The ratio for the control on 1.1gL−1 was higher at 1.5mol H2 per mol CO2 produced. The estimated ratios based on fermentation end-products were similar for all substrates. Yields were calculated based on the mass of substrates added to the culture. Among the alternative substrates the highest yields were found in DDGs. Rates of production of H2 and CO2 were similar between DDGs and CBH, but much lower for BH (Table 2 ). All three substrates showed much lower rates of production of end-products than the control on 1.1gL−1. The final amounts of H2 and CO2 were very similar for all three substrates. The ratio of H2 to glucose equivalent utilized was higher in the alternative substrates than the α-cellulose controls. DDGs showed the highest ratio of moles of H2 produced per glucose equivalent utilized at 1.27 followed by BH and CBH."
10,Discussion,"Approximately 30% of DDGs is composed of degradable fiber, which includes non-starch polysaccharides (cellulose, hemicellulose xylose, arabinose and pectin), lignin and glycoprotein [12], indicating that out of the 5gL−1 DDGs added to the balch tubes, 1.5gL−1 could be available for degradation by C. thermocellum. Therefore, 1.1gL−1 of α-cellulose (which had also been used in other published experiments in this group [11]) was used as the control to compare the fermentation between a lab grade substrate and the alternative substrates under carbon limiting conditions. Experimental results showed that less of the alternative substrates (DDGs, CBH and BH) were converted to end-products than the 1.1gL−1 α-cellulose. It is possible that not all of the cellulose in the substrate is available to the bacteria, or simply that the alternative substrates do not contain the same amount of cellulose as the 1.1gL−1 α-cellulose. The degradable fractions of the BH and CBH were approximated using the analysis of neutral and acid detergent fiber completed at the University of Manitoba (see Table 3 ). Acid detergent fiber (ADF) refers to the cell wall portions of the barley hulls that are made up of cellulose and lignin. The neutral detergent fiber (NDF) value is the total cell wall, which is comprised of the ADF fraction plus hemicellulose. Therefore, the difference between NDF and ADF in the alternative substrates represents the amount of hemicellulose. Both the CBH and non-contaminated BH contain approximately 25–30% hemicellulose. Considering that C. thermocellum cannot metabolize hemicellulose [10], the initial degradable amount of BH and CBH in the balch tubes is a maximum of 1.25 and 1.45gL−1, respectively (depending on lignin content which could not be determined). All of the alternative substrates produced similar final amounts of H2, also comparable to the 1.1gL−1 α-cellulose control while the maximum H2 production rates were significantly higher for DDGs and CBH than BH. This suggests that, although fermentable substrate was available during the exponential phase of growth, carbon limited conditions prevailed in the alternative substrates. The complex substrates yield 22–34% less H2 than the pure α-cellulose on a per gram of fiber basis, indicating that omitting a pretreatment process will result in a reduction in overall efficiency. Rani et al. [13] showed a 10% conversion efficiency of untreated paddy straw, sorghum stover and deshelled corn cobs after 5 days incubation with C. thermocellum strains SS21 and SS22. Following delignification by alkali treatment, this efficiency was reported to increase to above 50%. In that case, the concentrations of cellulosic substrate tested were much higher (varied from 10 to 120gL−1), which will also affect conversion efficiencies. After autoclaving, the DDGs tubes contained high initial concentrations of lactate (close to 1mM compared to insignificant levels in the control). This background concentration of lactate may have inhibited lactate production in those tubes. Lactate production is higher when readily degradable substrate is abundant and the pH is low at the end of growth [11]. These experiments show lower lactate production, indicating a lack of degradable substrate at the end of growth. When higher concentrations of α-cellulose were tested, the lactate yield was higher, which supports this hypothesis. In addition, the pH drop in the alternative substrate experiments was lower than in the control (Table 1A). This indicates that pH was not responsible for the shift from the exponential phase to the stationary phase, but most likely due to lack of readily available substrate. In all substrates, acetate was the major end-product followed by ethanol, formate and lactate. In the alternative substrate experiments, the ratios of acetate to ethanol and acetate to formate were higher than the control (see Table 1). High formate and ethanol yields for the α-cellulose controls showed that abundance of pure cellulosic substrate was shifting the metabolism away from acetate pathways. BH had the highest ratios of acetate to ethanol (A/E) and acetate to formate (A/F). Low formate production is indicative of low rates of degradation of readily degradable substrate [11]. The rates of gas production were also lowest in the exponential phase of BH fermentation relative to the two other complex substrates, yet the yield was similar to the DDGs and CBH. Higher amounts of readily degradable substrate in the DDGs and CBH would explain the higher gas production rates, as well as the lower ratios of A/E and A/F. Both the BH and the CBH produced a similar yield, implying that the same amount of material was degraded, but the initial degradation rate of the CBH was faster. This initial higher rate of production can be attributed to substrate being made available by the action of cellulosic enzymes. The fusarium CBH may have more available sites on which the bacteria can attach. Therefore, it can be assumed that at the start of the experiment, tubes containing BH had less readily accessible substrate than those with DDG and CBH. The type of cellulose found in nature is not purely crystalline. Studies have shown that the degree of crystallinity of the cellulose is an important characteristic in determining the effect of enzymatic hydrolysis [14,15]. Another consideration when accounting for the lower degradability of the alternative substrates in comparison to the α-cellulose is the content and organization of lignin within the sample. Beyond the fact that lignin has not been reported to be degraded by C. thermocellum, the characteristics and the structure of the lignin and how it is arranged within the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions will influence the overall degradability of the substance [16]. For example, if the cellulose is contained within a lignin shell, then the bacteria will first have to degrade the lignin to access the cellulose. This is why the relationship between lignin content and biodegradability is not always linear."
11,Conclusions,"The untreated natural substrates tested in this experiment showed good potential for H2 production and other valuable end-products when compared with lab grade α-cellulose. All substrates produced similar amounts of H2, which were comparable to those produced with the α-cellulose control. However, the overall amount of H2 produced per glucose equivalent utilized was higher for the alternative substrates. The Fusarium fungus may have made the cellulose in the barley hulls more available to degradation, which could aid in increasing fermentation efficiency to C. thermocellum. This synergistic effort between the enzymes of both species could account for the high hydrogen production rates from CBH. Overall, this study indicates that the source of biomass substrate will have a substantial impact on further processing with cellulose degrading organisms such as C. thermocellum. Hydrogen produced through C. thermocellum fermentation can be an attractive candidate for the development of sustainable energy from a variety of waste biomass streams."
