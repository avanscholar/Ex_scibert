0,Introduction,"Knowledge of the physical properties of a given molecular fluid is of great importance in a wide variety of industrial settings. In many instances obtaining these properties experimentally is prohibitive, for example, due to a compound’s instability, safety concerns, or economic factors. For this reason, the calculation of fluid properties by molecular simulation is becoming an increasingly popular and useful tool. In addition, simulation allows for microscopic insight that is often not attainable experimentally. This insight can be extremely useful in better understanding processes at the molecular level. In the present study, we test the accuracy of the united atom version of the transferable potentials for phase equilibria (TraPPE-UA) force field for the prediction of the Newtonian viscosities and vapor–liquid equilibria of five polyhydric alcohols, namely 1,2-butanediol, 1,3-butanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol, and 1,2,4-butanetriol. Compounds of this type are widely used as lubricants and heat transfer liquids in heating and cooling systems [1]. Therefore, accurate knowledge of their physical properties over a wide range of state points is of great value in the design of equipment for these and other applications. In addition to the physical property predictions, we have used the trajectories from our simulations for a microscopic-level hydrogen bond analysis. This analysis was done to help rationalize the relative orders of viscosities, boiling points, enthalpies of vaporization, and critical properties. Part of the work presented here is in response to the Molecule Transferability Problem of the 2006 Industrial Fluid Properties Simulation Challenge (http://fluidproperties.org/challenge/third/challenge.html). The task of this Simulation Challenge was to predict the Newtonian viscosities of the five polyhydric alcohols at two pressures, 1 and 250MPa, and a temperature of 373K. The rest of the work presented here, i.e. computing viscosities at additional statepoints and predicting vapor–liquid equilibria, was done to further demonstrate the transferability of the TraPPE force field to predict multiple properties at a wide range of state points. Results from this study show that the TraPPE force field achieves very good agreement with experiment. For example, where experimental values were available, we were able to reproduce the correct order of boiling points, critical temperatures and critical densities of the polyhydric alcohols. Quantitative agreement was also very good in most cases. Values of critical and boiling temperatures computed from Gibbs ensemble simulations on average deviate by only 1 and 2% from experiment, respectively. For the majority of the compounds studied, the computed viscosities also compare well to experimental data. The TraPPE force field yields viscosities for 1,2-butanediol and 1,2,4-butanediol within an average of 10% from experiment while 1,4-butanediol and 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol are within 15%. However, the viscosity of 1,3-butanediol is substantially overestimated by an average of 34%. It should be stressed that although the non-bonded parameters of the TraPPE force field were obtained by fitting to vapor–liquid equilibria of selected test molecules, none of the polyhydric alcohols investigated in the present work were used in the fitting process. In fact, all non-bonded and bonded parameters needed for the simulations of these polyhydric alcohols have previously been published [2–5]. Furthermore, the TraPPE force field has never been parameterized to reproduce transport properties, such as viscosities. Thus, the results presented herein are pure predictions and further validate the transferability of the TraPPE force field and its ability to reproduce a variety of properties at a wide range of state points."
1,Background on the RNEMD method,"Transport coefficients are a measure of the response of a system to a perturbation that drives the system away from equilibrium. For small perturbations, the response of the system is linear with respect to the perturbation, and linear response theory can be used to obtain the transport coefficient. In this case, the constitutive equation is (1) J = − L ∇ X where J is the response, L the transport coefficient, and X is the perturbation. For the shear viscosity, Eq. (1) takes the form (2) j y ( p x ) = − η ∂ v x ∂ y where j y ( p x ) is the momentum flux, ∂ v x / ∂ y the velocity gradient or shear rate ( γ ˙ ) and η is the shear viscosity coefficient. The conventional approach [6] for computing the shear viscosity is to perform an equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation and use a Green–Kubo expression of the form (3) η = V k B T ∫ 0 ∞ 〈 P x y ( 0 ) P x y ( t ) 〉 d t where the integration is over the autocorrelation function of the xy component of the stress tensor. The statistical accuracy can be improved by averaging over additional components of the stress tensor [7]. While this approach has been used successfully for many systems, there are several well-documented drawbacks, including the sensitivity of the result to the integration time and the weak signal-to-noise ratio that results from reliance on equilibrium fluctuations in the stress tensor. As an alternative, nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) techniques have been developed in which the system is driven away from equilibrium and the response is monitored. This greatly improves the signal-to-noise ratio, but extrapolation to the zero-shear limit is required to obtain the Newtonian viscosity. NEMD is the only simulation technique capable of determining the non-Newtonian viscosity. The most widely used NEMD approach for viscosity calculations is the so-called “SLLOD” algorithm [8,9] in which a shear rate is imposed on the system and the resulting stress is computed. The shear viscosity is found at a given shear rate from (4) η = − P x y γ ˙ For the SLLOD algorithm, special “sliding brick” boundary conditions [6] are also typically used, which require modification of the Ewald sum if charged systems are simulated [10]. In the equilibrium and NEMD methods described above, the stress is computed in response to a natural and an imposed shear rate, respectively. That is, the “cause” is the imposed velocity gradient and the “effect” is the measured momentum flux. Unfortunately, at low strain rates (i.e. in the near Newtonian regime) the stress tends to vary wildly in a simulation, and therefore convergence can take a long time. As an alternative, one can impose the quantity that is difficult to compute in a simulation (the momentum flux) and compute the easy to determine quantity (the shear rate or velocity profile). This is the idea behind several methods [11–13] including a technique called reverse nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (RNEMD) developed by Müller-Plathe [14–16]. We have chosen to utilize the RNEMD method in this work. In this section we briefly summarize the key points of the method, the details of which can be found elsewhere [14]. The simulation box is divided into N small bins or slabs in the y direction, as shown in Fig. 1 . A stress or momentum flux in the y direction is imposed on the system by exchanging the momentum between an atom with the most negative x momentum in bin n = 1 with another atom in bin n = n c = ( N / 2 ) + 1 that has the largest momentum in the positive x direction. If both atoms have the same mass, the total linear momentum and the kinetic energy are conserved. The momenta swaps are carried out periodically, so that the total exchanged momentum is (5) p total = ∑ ( p x , n c − p x , n 1 ) Note that the frequency of the swaps determines the total imposed flux on the system. After any time t, the imposed momentum flux is (6) j y ( p x ) = p total 2 t L x L z where L x and L z are the lengths of the simulation box in x and z directions, respectively. The system responds to the unphysical imposed momentum flux by establishing a real momentum flow in the opposite direction. This sets up a linear velocity profile in the upper and lower halves of the simulation box. From the slopes of the velocity profiles (which are easy to measure in a simulation) and the imposed momentum flux, the shear viscosity may be determined from Eq. (2)."
2,Validation of the RNEMD method,"Before we applied the RNEMD method to the Challenge systems, we validated the method and our codes by computing the viscosity of several test systems for which literature data are available. These include argon, n-hexane, water and molten sodium chloride (NaCl). These systems were chosen because they represent widely used model types and their viscosities have either already been determined or they can be computed accurately using conventional simulation techniques. They thus provide a rigorous test of the RNEMD method. All the simulations were carried out in the canonical ensemble with a Nośe–Hoover chain thermostat [17]. A multiple time step algorithm (r-RESPA) [18] was used for molecular systems, with the inner/outer timestep being 0.5fs/1.5fs for water and 1fs/4fs for n-hexane. The time steps used for atomic systems were 2fs for NaCl and 4fs for argon. The aspect ratio (AR) of all the simulation boxes used for validation of this method was 3.0, i.e. L y / L x = L y / L z = 3.0 , except for water where the aspect ratio was set to 1.0. The box was divided into 20 bins to determine the velocity profile. A cutoff radius of 10.0Å was used for Lennard–Jones interactions for all the systems other than for argon, where a cutoff radius of 10.215Å was used. Long range corrections were applied. The electrostatic interactions were handled using a particle mesh Ewald approach with a real space cutoff of 10Å. We used a locally developed software package for all the viscosity simulations. In the argon simulations, 2592atoms at a density ρ = 1.427 g/cm3 and a temperature T = 86.5 K were simulated. The Lennard–Jones parameters were identical to those used by Müller-Plathe [14]. For n-hexane, 2000 molecules were simulated with intramolecular terms taken from the work of Siepmann and co-workers [19]. Non-bonded parameters were the same as those reported by Martin and Siepmann [20]. The state point was T = 298 K and ρ = 0.655 g/cm3, which is the same as that studied by Kioupis and Maginn [21]. For water, a flexible SPC/E model was used. The potential parameters, force constants for bond stretching and the angle bending were taken from the work of Fuller and Rowley [22]. Five hundred water molecules were simulated at T = 300 K and ρ = 1.004 g/cm3, as also considered by Fuller and Rowley [22]. For NaCl, 512 ion pairs (512 Na+and 512 Cl−) were simulated using the well known Born–Huggins–Mayer potential with the parameters set by Tosi and Fumi [23–25]. The simulations were carried out at the state point studied by Delhommelle and Petravic [26], i.e. T = 1500 K and ρ = 1.5 g/cm3. A range of swap rates was used for all the systems considered. The Newtonian viscosities were determined for all systems except water by fitting the shear rate dependent viscosities to a Carreau model, as described below. To enable comparison with the results by Fuller and Rowley [22], the shear-dependent viscosities were fit to a mode coupling model. The results of the validation runs for all these systems are summarized in Table 1 . We also show the literature or the accepted values for the shear viscosity of these systems. As can be seen, our calculations yield estimates of the shear viscosity that are in good agreement with the literature values."
3,Simulation details,
4,Force field,"4.1 Force field All of the polyhydric alcohols in this study were represented by the united atom version of the transferable potentials for phase equilibria (TraPPE-UA) force field [2–5]. In this united atom force field CH x groups are modeled as pseudo atoms with sites located on the carbon atoms while atoms in all other functional groups are modeled explicitly. Non-bonded interactions in the TraPPE-UA force field are described by a combination of pairwise additive Lennard–Jones (LJ) and Coulombic terms. (7) u ( r i j ) = 4 ϵ i j σ i j r i j 12 − σ i j r i j 6 + q i q j 4 π ϵ 0 r i j where r i j , ϵ i j , σ i j , q i , and q j are the separation between atoms, LJ well depth, LJ diameter, and (fixed) partial charges for a pair of atoms i and j. For unlike interactions we use the Lorentz–Berthelot combining rules [27,28], i.e. ϵ i j = ϵ i ϵ j and σ i j = ( 1 / 2 ) ( σ i + σ j ) . A spherical potential truncation for bead–bead interactions beyond 14Å together with analytic tail corrections are used for the LJ portion of the potential, while the electrostatic interactions were evaluated using the Ewald summation technique with κ = 0.2 and tin foil boundary conditions [6]. Non-bonded interactions are considered for all sites belonging to different molecules and for sites on the same molecule when they are separated by four or more bonds. Coulombic interactions are also included for sites separated by three bonds but scaled by a factor of 0.5. In addition, there is a special short range repulsive intramolecular term for hydroxyl groups on neighboring carbon atoms [5] to prevent an overestimation of 1–5 intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The following simple potential [5] is used between hydroxyl hydrogens and oxygens separated by four bonds (8) u repulsive ( r i j ) = a r i j 12 with a / k B = 7.5 × 1 0 7 KÅ12. A full list of the non-bonded interaction parameters used in this study are given in Table 2. Torsional interactions for sites separated by three bonds are modeled by a cosine series [29] (9) u tors = c 0 + c 1 [ 1 + cos ⁡ ( ϕ ) ] + c 2 [ 1 − cos ⁡ ( 2 ϕ ) ] + c 3 [ 1 + cos ⁡ ( 3 ϕ ) ] where ϕ is the dihedral angle. Due to the relative complexity of the molecules in this study, a few of the torsional potentials were not present in the original TraPPE-UA force field nor available in the literature for CH x pseudo atoms. In these cases, we assume that two torsional potentials, A–B–C–D and W–X–Y–Z are equivalent under two conditions: (1) both atoms B and X, and atoms C and Y are the same and have the same hybridization, (2) both atoms A and W, and atoms D and Z are in the same row of the periodic table. For example, the 1,2-diol torsion O–CH–CH2–O was not available so we have used the CH x –CH–CH2–CH y torsional potential in its place. The c n coefficients used in this study are listed in Table 2 . A harmonic potential is used to model the interaction of sites separated by two bonds (10) u bend = k θ ( θ − θ 0 ) 2 where k θ , θ , and θ 0 are the bending constant, bending angle, and equilibrium bending angle, respectively. Table 2 contains a list of the values for k θ and θ 0 used here. Finally, the interaction of atoms directly bonded together was treated in two different ways depending on the type of simulation. In all of our Monte Carlo simulations we use fixed bond lengths while in our molecular dynamics simulations we use a harmonic bond stretching potential (11) u stretch = k r ( r − r 0 ) 2 where k r , r , and r 0 are the bond stretching constant, bond length, and equilibrium bond length. We have made this choice since using fixed bond lengths somewhat increases the efficiency of CBMC simulations and it has been previously shown that replacing fixed bond lengths with harmonic stretching potentials has no significant effect on liquid densities or vapor–liquid phase equilibria [30]. In contrast, harmonic stretching potentials are more convenient for molecular dynamics simulations and the use of fixed bond lengths has been shown to lead to an under prediction of viscosities [22]. Since the TraPPE-UA force field does not contain bond stretching constants, we have taken these from the AMBER force field [31] without further modification. These stretching constants and equilibrium distances (which are also the fixed distances in our MC simulations) are given in Table 2."
5,Viscosity calculations,"4.2 Viscosity calculations The first step in predicting the viscosities of the five polyhydric alcohols was to compute their liquid densities at the four state points of interest ( T = 373 K; p = 0.1 , 25, 100 and 250 MPa). For this purpose, we used coupled–decoupled configurational-bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) simulations [3,32,33] in the NpT ensemble [34]. Each simulation system contained 200 molecules and was equilibrated for at least 30,000 Monte Carlo cycles followed by a production period of 50,000 Monte Carlo cycles. (One Monte Carlo cycle consists of N Monte Carlo steps, where N is the number of molecules in the system.) Volume moves were attempted with a 0.5% probability (once every 5 cycles). The remaining probability to attempt a given move was divided evenly among translational, rotational, and CBMC moves. During the equilibration period, the maximum volume, translational, and rotational displacements were adjusted such that an acceptance ratio of 0.5 was achieved. Uncertainties in all reported quantities were estimated from the standard error of the mean obtained from the three independent simulations carried out at each pressure. Using these computed densities, molecular dynamics simulations in the NVT ensemble were carried out to compute the viscosity of each compound at the four state points. A system size of 400 molecules and orthogonal boxes with an aspect ratio (AR) of 2.0 were used in this calculation. As with the validation runs, the reversible multiple time stepping algorithm (r-RESPA) [18] was used with an inner time step of 0.5fs and an outer time step of 2fs. A three chain Nośe–Hoover thermostat [17] was used to control temperature. Again, the box was divided into 14 bins to determine the velocity profile. The system was equilibrated without momentum swaps for 250 ps. Following this, production runs using momentum swaps were conducted for the time required for the viscosity to reach a plateau. An example of this convergence behavior is shown in Fig. 2 ."
6,Gibbs ensemble simulations of vapor–liquid equilibria,"4.3 Gibbs ensemble simulations of vapor–liquid equilibria To determine the vapor–liquid coexistence curves, coupled–decoupled CBMC simulations [3,32,33,35] in the NVT Gibbs ensemble [36–38] were performed. A system size of 200 molecules was used and at least 30,000 cycles of equilibration and 30,000 cycles of production were carried out for each simulation. Volume moves were attempted with a 0.5% probability, particle exchange moves were attempted such that there was one accepted move every ten cycles, and the remaining probability to attempt a given move was divided evenly among translational, rotational, and CBMC moves. During the equilibration period, the maximum volume, translational, and rotational displacements were adjusted such that an acceptance ratio of 0.5 was achieved. Critical temperatures ( T c ) and densities ( ρ c ) were estimated using the scaling law and the law of rectilinear diameters with a scaling exponent of β ∗ = 0.325 [39,40]. Normal boiling points ( T b ) and critical pressures were extrapolated from the ensemble averaged pressures at each temperature via the Clausius–Clapeyron equation. Uncertainties in all reported quantities were estimated from the error of the mean for the five independent simulations carried out at each temperature."
7,Data analysis,"4.4 Data analysis A typical result of a RNEMD run is a velocity profile and an estimate of the shear viscosity as a function of time. Fig. 2(a) shows the velocity profile for 1,4-butanediol at P = 25 MPa and T = 373 K. The slope of each half combined with the known frequency of momentum swaps gives an estimate of the viscosity via Eqs. 2 and 6. The time averaging of the data is done on the fly by averaging the data after every 10 timesteps. A least squares fit of the data is then used to determine the shear viscosity and error. As an example of the typical convergence behavior, the shear viscosity as a function of time for 1,4-butanediol at the same state point is shown in Fig. 2(b). In general, the stress obtained from the imposed swap rate was independent of pressure. At 250MPa, the stress was very slow to reach steady state, while at lower pressures the stress converged quickly. As a result for all but one system at 250MPa, the stress at 100MPa was used in Eq. (2). Error bars were calculated in two different ways. For argon and n-hexane, each velocity profile was linear and enabled a straightforward determination of the viscosity at each shear rate. Five independent simulations were run for each shear rate, from which an average viscosity and error estimate (from the standard deviation) were obtained. A Carreau fit to the data was then used to estimate the zero-shear viscosity. For all other systems, we ran only one simulation at each of the shear rates and state points. It was observed that for some systems at the lowest shear rates, the profiles were not completely linear, but exhibited a small discontinuity near the boundary where momentum swaps occur. This can clearly be seen in Fig. 2. Previous work [41] has shown that this is indicative of sluggish dynamics, in which the time scale of the momentum transfer becomes commensurate with the underlying dynamical time scale of the liquid. A line connecting the velocities in the boundary bins ( n = 1 and n = n c ) will tend to underestimate the viscosity, while a fit to only the linear middle region ( n = 2 through n = n c − 1 ) will tend to overestimate the viscosity. As a practical compromise, we estimated the viscosity and error in the following manner. A least squares regression was performed on three parts of the velocity profile: (i) the two end bin velocities ( n = 1 and n = N c ); (ii) the middle section of the profile ( n = 2 through n = n c − 1 ); (iii) the entire velocity profile ( n = 1 through n = n c ) [42]. Each fit results in a slightly different viscosity estimate and shear rate. The average and standard deviation of these three viscosities at the average shear rate was then used to obtain the zero-shear rate viscosity for the alcohols by fitting these data points to a Carreau model (12) η ( γ ˙ ) = η 0 [ 1 + ( λ γ ˙ ) 2 ] p where the parameters have the following meaning: η 0 is the limiting Newtonian viscosity as the shear rate γ ˙ → 0 and λ is a characteristic time constant, which has been found to be roughly equal to the rotational relaxation time for many systems. At high shear rates, a power law behavior is approached with η ∝ γ ˙ − 2 p . The standard error on η 0 is taken as the estimate of the error bar on the zero-shear viscosity. As stated earlier, a mode coupling theory fit was used for water in order to compare the results with literature values. For the case of 1,4-butanediol at 250MPa, the estimates of the viscosity showed an increasing trend with lowering of shear rate. We did not have enough data in the Newtonian regime to fit a Carreau model through the data. It is for this reason we fit a mode coupling model through these data points in order to estimate the zero-shear viscosity. However, for the cases of 1,2,4-butanetriol at 0.1, 25 and 250MPa pressures and for 1,2-butanediol and 1,3-butanediol at 250MPa pressure (Fig. 3 ), all the simulations were in the Newtonian regime. For these cases, a horizontal line was fit through the data set to get an estimate of the zero-shear viscosity. In all the cases the data were weighted by the magnitude of the error bars. The standard deviation on the fitting parameter is noted as the estimate of the standard error on the viscosity. The consistency of the estimates of individual shear rates is cross-checked using the so-called time–temperature superposition method [43], a method often used with polymers to obtain the shear-dependent viscosity. This method has subsequently been applied to linear and branched alkanes [44,45]. The method is normally applied to scale the viscosities at different temperatures to one temperature. As the effect of changing temperature or changing pressure is mostly on the change of density of the system, we can apply the method to scale the viscosity at different pressures to one pressure, here scaling data at 0.1, 25 and 250 onto 100 MPa (Fig. 4 ). A master curve is obtained at any desired pressure in two steps [43]: (1) The curve at pressure P is shifted vertically by log ⁡ [ η 0 ( P 0 ) / η 0 ( P ) ] and (2) the resulting curve in then shifted horizontally such that the two curves superpose. As shown later, the data sets at all four pressures fall right on top of each other, giving us an indication that these sets are consistent."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Viscosity prediction,"5.1 Viscosity prediction Densities at different state points computed from the NpT simulations are given in Table 3 . Where comparison to experiment was available, we were able to reproduce the relative order of the densities and the experimental values within 2% or better. It is these computed values that were used to run our constant density molecular dynamics simulations. The results for all five systems at four different state points along with comparison to experimental values [1] are summarized in Table 4 and also in Fig. 3. The fitted parameters for Eq. (12) are also summarized in Table 5 . Note that the 0.1 MPa results were submitted with our entry for the IFPSC challenge. We erroneously submitted the 25 MPa results as our 250MPa predictions. Here, we correct this error and report the actual viscosities predicted by the TraPPE model. Since the goal of this study was to estimate the zero-shear viscosities, simulations were mainly run in the Newtonian regime. As a result, there were insufficient data in the non-Newtonian regime for aforementioned systems to use a Carreau fit. For the other systems, however, a Carreau fit was performed on the data. Compared to the experimental data for the Newtonian viscosities at low pressure (0.1MPa) reported by Gordon et al. [1] for these five polyhydric alcohols, the TraPPE force field underpredicts the viscosities of 1,2- and 1,4-butanediol by 5 and 14%, respectively, overestimates those of 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol and 1,2,4-butanetriol by 15 and 9%, respectively, and substantially overestimates that of 1,3-butanediol by 43%. As a consequence of the overprediction of the viscosity for 1,3-butanediol, the simulated viscosities for the three butanediol isomers increase from 1,2-butanediol to 1,4-butanediol to 1,3-butanediol. In contrast, the experimental viscosities at 373K and 0.1MPa order as follows: 1,2-, 1,3-, and 1,4-butanediol. However, it should be noted that the experimental measurements by Sun et al. [46] show that for temperatures lower than about 320K, 1,3-butanediol does have a higher viscosity than 1,4-butanediol. As temperature increases, the viscosity of 1,3-butanediol falls below that of 1,4-butanediol. Compared to the experimental data for the Newtonian viscosities at high pressure (250MPa) reported by Gordon et al. [1] for these five polyhydric alcohols, the TraPPE force field underpredicts the viscosities of 1,2- and 1,2,4-butanetriol by 8 and 2%, respectively, overestimates those of 1,3-butanediol and 1,4-butanediol by 4 and 10%, respectively, and substantially underestimates that of 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol by 23%. However, as the predicted viscosity increase with pressure is underestimated for 1,3-butanediol and overestimated for 1,4-butanediol, the order of the five predicted viscosities at 250MPa agrees with the experimental data. Compared to the experimental data at all four pressures (0.1, 25, 100, and 250MPa), the TraPPE force field yields mean unsigned and mean signed percent errors (averaged over the five polyhydric alcohols) of 16 and 6%, respectively. Fig. 5 shows the viscosity as a function of pressure obtained from the simulations and experiments. From this plot, it is apparent that the simulations capture the viscosity trends quantitatively. The pressure dependence of the viscosity is often modeled with the Barus equations [47,48], given by (13) η ( P ) = η 0 exp ⁡ ( α P P ) , where α P is the Barus coefficient. The results follow this equation very well. Table 4 shows a comparison of the Barus coefficient obtained from experiments and simulations, weighted by the standard error. Although the predicted α P for 1,2-butanediol, 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol, and 1,2,4-butanetriol agree very well with the experimental data of Gordon et al. [1](the percent errors are + 3, − 6, and − 4%, respectively), α P for 1,3-butanediol is underestimated by 28% and that for 1,4-butanediol is overestimated by 35%. Nevertheless, the overall agreement is comparable or better than previous simulation data for linear and branched alkanes [49–51]. The four sets of viscosities at four different pressures were then scaled to P = 100 MPa using a method very similar to time–temperature superpositioning, described earlier. The results of this scaling are summarized in Fig. 4. As can be seen from the plot the scaling confirms that all four sets of viscosities are consistent to each other. We also fit the scaled data sets to a Carreau fit as described before. This fit can be used as the universal curve for those particular diols and triols. These scaled viscosities are in good agreement with the viscosities estimated using individual sets."
10,Molecular-level analysis of relative viscosities,"5.2 Molecular-level analysis of relative viscosities To help explain the relative orders of viscosities we have analyzed molecular moments of inertia and the hydrogen bond structure of the liquids at T = 373 K and p = 0.1 and 250MPa. Intermolecular oxygen–oxygen and oxygen–hydroxyl hydrogen radial distribution functions (RDFs) from this analysis and their corresponding number integrals are shown in Fig. 6 . Some of the general features of the RDFs are shared between all of the polyhydric alcohols studied. The oxygen–oxygen RDFs show their first maximum at 2.7Å and first minimum at 3.6Å while the oxygen–hydrogen RDFs show a maximum and minimum at 1.8 and 2.6Å, respectively. The position and shape of the second and further peaks in each of the RDFs vary much more but this is most directly a consequence of the each alcohol having at least two hydroxyl groups but at different positions along the backbone of the molecule, i.e. the second and/or third nearest neighbor peaks may correspond to the same molecule as the first. The effect of increasing pressure on liquid structure is also of interest. Fig. 7 compares the oxygen–oxygen and oxygen–hydrogen RDFs at 0.1 and 250 MPa for the three butanediols examined here. The plots indicate that there are no substantial changes in liquid structure upon increasing pressure. There is a slight decrease in the height of the first peak of all the RDFs at 250MPa, but this is a consequence of the normalization to a uniform distribution and not to a decrease in hydrogen bonding [52]. Intramolecular oxygen–oxygen and oxygen–hydroxyl hydrogen radial distribution functions are given in Fig. 8 . For 1,2-butanediol and 1,2,4-butanetriol we observe large peaks in the RDFs centered at 2.9Å for the oxygen–oxygen pairs and 2.6Å for the oxygen–hydrogen pairs, an indication of intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The other alcohols show only small peaks corresponding to intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Distributions of hydrogen bond energies are shown in Fig. 9 . This energy is computed from the sum of site–site interactions between two CH x –O–H groups. The distributions show that 1,4-butanediol and 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol have slightly stronger hydrogen bonds than the rest of the alcohols while 1,2-butanediol appears to have the weakest. This suggests that hydroxyl groups on the chain ends can form stronger hydrogen bonds because there is less steric hindrance. In all cases, the minimum in these distributions appears to be at about − 10 kJ/mol. There does not appear to be a substantial change in the energy distribution upon change in pressure. Based on the RDFs we have chosen the following simple criteria for a hydrogen bond: an oxygen–oxygen distance less than 3.6Å and oxygen–hydrogen distance less than 2.6Å. Since each hydrogen may only participate in one hydrogen bond, when there are two possible acceptor oxygens that satisfy the above criteria only the one closest to the donor hydrogen is counted. We have calculated the average number of hydrogen bonds per molecule from our MC NpT simulations using the above criteria and these data are shown in Table 6 . Of the four diols, 1,4-butanediol forms the most intermolecular hydrogen bonds while 1,2-butanediol forms the least. We also observe that intramolecular hydrogen bonding is more important for 1,2-butanediol and 1,2,4-butanetriol than for the other alcohols. However, even for these two alcohols, intramolecular hydrogen bonds account for no more than 3% of the total hydrogen bonds in a molecule. The size distribution of hydrogen bonded clusters could also have an impact on the viscosity of the alcohols. These distributions at the lowest and highest pressures examined are shown in Fig. 10 . From these we observe that at 0.1 MPa 1,2-butanediol has the sharpest distribution of clusters with the smallest cluster size (5) at its maximum. 1,3-butanediol, 1,4-butanediol, and 2-methyl-1,3-butanediol have a much broader distributions with maxima around 25. However, these diols still have a significant probability of smaller cluster sizes. 1,2,4-butanetriol has the widest distribution, a maximum at around 50, and the lowest probability of smaller clusters. Upon increasing pressure, the position of the maximum shifts to larger cluster sizes in all systems. Additionally, the shape of the distribution changes. The probability of smaller clusters (sizes to the left of the maximum) decreases while the probability of larger clusters (to the right of the maximum) increases. To better understand the shapes of molecules and how this relates to viscosity we have computed the distribution of the principal moments of inertia (Fig. 11 ) and their average ratios (Table 7 ). The ratios of moments of inertia indicate that all molecules have cylindrical like shapes. However, 1,4-butanediol is most elongated followed by 1,3-butanediol. 1,2-butanediol is the least elongated. The distribution of the moments of inertia is broadest for 1,4-butanediol and 1,2,4-butanetriol and narrowest for 1,3-butanediol. The narrow distribution for 1,3-butanediol indicates that one conformer is predominantly present in its liquid phase. The principal moments of inertia for all five polyhydric alcohols show little dependence on pressure. Thus, the conformational distributions are affected little by pressure. Having presented some aspects of liquid structure, we now discuss possible explanations for the relative order of the viscosities that were computed. At all pressures, 1,2-butanediol has the lowest viscosity. This correlates well with the density, the number of hydrogen bonds this molecule forms, and the position of the maximum in the aggregate size distribution, which are all also the lowest among the five molecules. On the other side, 1,2,4-butanetriol has the highest viscosity, the most hydrogen bonds, the largest aggregate sizes and the highest density. In the middle, the trends are not as clear. For example, 1,4-butanediol has more hydrogen bonds per molecule than both 1,3-butanediol and 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol, yet a lower viscosity. These three molecules have very similar densities and aggregate size distributions so these cannot be used to explain the differences. As indicated by the ratios of the moments of inertia in Table 7, 1,4-butanediol is clearly the most linear of the three molecules. Additionally, the distributions of the moments of inertia for 1,4-butanediol are much broader than both 1,3-butanediol and 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol. Together the more elongated shape and higher flexibility of 1,4-butanediol should reduce the barrier for diffusive processes, and indeed it has a lower viscosity than the other two isomers at all pressures. With that said, perhaps the reason for the overestimation of the viscosity of 1,3-butanediol compared to experiment is a torsional potential with unrealistically high barrier heights. It is worthy to note that these barrier heights should not affect the vapor–liquid equilibria; the position and height of the minima in the torsional potential have a much greater influence on phase equilibria. Since we quantitatively predict the vapor–liquid equilibria of 1,3-butanediol (see Section 1), this suggests that the intermolecular interactions and conformational distributions are well modeled and that the source for error in the viscosity calculation is not the non-bonded terms in the force field, but possibly the barrier heights in one or more of the torsional potentials that were unique to this molecule."
11,Vapor–liquid phase equilibria,"5.3 Vapor–liquid phase equilibria Table 8 compares the normal boiling points and critical properties obtained for the TraPPE-UA model with experiment [53–55]. From this comparison, we see that overall agreement with experiment is very good. Normal boiling points are reproduced within 2%, critical temperatures within 1%, critical densities within 5%, and critical pressures within 20%. Despite that many of the values for the properties listed in Table 8 are closely spaced between the different alcohols, we are able to faithfully reproduce the relative order of all of them except for the critical pressure. In general, the force field tends to slightly underestimate boiling and critical temperatures and overestimate critical densities and pressures. Vapor–liquid coexistence curves, Clausius–Clapeyron plots, and heats of vaporization for TraPPE-UA force field and available experimental data are shown in Figs. 12–14 , respectively. The Clausius–Clapeyron plots and heats of vaporization show excellent qualitative agreement with experiment in that the relative experimental orders of ln ⁡ p and Δ H vap are reproduced over a wide temperature range. However, there is a small tendency of the TraPPE model to overestimate the pressure and underestimate the enthalpy. Numerical results for all of Gibbs Ensemble simulations are given in Table 9 . Using the hydrogen bond criteria outlined above, for consistency, we have computed the number of hydrogen bonds per molecule in the liquid phase at each of the temperatures simulated. The results of this analysis are shown in Table 9. From this we see a very good correlation between the number of hydrogen bonds and the liquid to vapor thermodynamics for the isomeric butanediols. For a given system the number of hydrogen bonds in the liquid phase decreases with increasing temperature as do the enthalpies of vaporization. At a given temperature the liquid with the largest number of hydrogen bonds has the highest enthalpy and entropy of vaporization. And, finally, for two compounds with similar heats of vaporization at different temperatures the one with the higher entropy of vaporization has more hydrogen bonds."
12,Conclusions,"Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics and equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations were employed to predict the Newtonian viscosities and vapor–liquid coexistence curves for five polyhydric butanol isomers. All force field parameters were taken from the literature and none of these parameters had been fit to experimental data on viscosity or on the compounds in this study. For pressures ranging from 0.1 to 250 MPa, the mean unsigned error of the predicted viscosities was 9% for 1,2-butanediol, 34% for 1,3-butanediol, 14% for 1,4-butanediol, 16% for 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol, and 6% for 1,2,4-butanetriol. Thus, the predictions for all polyhydric alcohols but 1,3-butanediol are rather satisfactory. The predicted vapor–liquid equilibria showed both qualitative and quantitative agreement with experiment. The correct trends were obtained for vapor–liquid coexistence curves but not for the viscosities. This could be explained from the previous studies [56] which suggest that the torsional potential affects the viscosity more than it affects vapor–liquid coexistence curve. The predicted orders of both boiling points and critical temperature agree with experiment and their values are within 2 and 1%, respectively. Furthermore, a structural analysis allows one to rationalize the relative order of the viscosities and vapor–liquid coexistence curves. The results demonstrate the predictive power of the methods used in this study, the transferability of the TraPPE force field to both multiple properties and state points, and the usefulness of simulation for explaining bulk properties with molecular-level observations."
