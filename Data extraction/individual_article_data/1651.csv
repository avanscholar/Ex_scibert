0,Introduction,"Bio-based resins and natural fiber composites have received great attention over the recent years. The escalating environmental cognizance and depleting fossil reserves pose a ubiquitous quest for lightweight structural materials with superb mechanical performance and sustainable economic production from natural, non-toxic, biodegradable, and carbon–neutral resources [1–3]. Cellulose-based natural fibers are renewable, environment-friendly, and sustainable polymers that have long been used in structural engineering, textiles, printing, and packaging [1,4–6]. However, the vast majority of polymer composites and resins used in modern life are derived from petrochemicals. Although these materials have appreciably improved the quality of life, environmental concerns linked with the raw materials utilized in their production [7] and life cycle [8] are menacing. Though there is no panacea for environmental challenges, an option is to consider sustainable alternatives. As material invention and innovation enter an era of unprecedented progress, cellulose-based materials have a lot more to offer as high-performance engineering materials for diverse strength and stiffness yet lightweight applications — aerospace, building, electronics and, automobiles. The enticing hierarchical structure of cellulose has made it possible to fabricate bio-based fibers and films via wet-spinning, electrospinning, cold drawing, wet stretching, and wet extrusion [9–12]. While a plethora of spinning technologies for long filaments using nanocellulose have been reported, the studies typically focus on revamping the fibers' mechanical performance [9,11,13,14]. By developing an ideal biodegradable resin with superb adhesion properties, the nanocellulose filaments (NF) made by wet spinning could promise high-performance and all-green fiber-reinforced polymer composite fabrication. However, despite the immense endeavors in developing lignin-based resins, none have been successfully applied to fabricate all-green NF-reinforced composites. Epoxy resins were originally and still predominantly used for fiber-reinforced polymer composites. On the contrary, they are mostly petroleum-based, thus not fully environment-friendly and onerous to be recycled. To overcome these limitations, bio-based resins derived from lignin such as poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-lignin [15,16], vanillin alcohol epoxy [17], poly(ethylene oxide)-lignin [18] and glycol lignin-poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether [19] have been reported. Lignin is deemed as the basis for formaldehyde-free resins since it is non-toxic. The rigidity of its aromatic ring favors the synthesis of thermosets with desirable thermal, chemical, and mechanical properties [20]. From an industrial viewpoint, lignin is a byproduct of paper and pulp production but is also created as a side stream from bioethanol and other biorefinery concepts i.e., it is an abundant and readily available resource. From a sustainable perspective, lignin has gained much attention as a salient alternative feedstock for petrol-based derivatives. Although the direct use of lignin is challenging for the synthesis of thermoset polymers due to the free OH group, poor solubility, and complex structure, many researchers have successfully modified lignin to improve its reactivity for high-performance applications [21–24]. The performance of fiber-reinforced polymer composites markedly depends on the interfacial adhesion strength between the fiber and polymer matrix. The cross-linking of lignin with PVA and other polymers has been reported to improve the adhesion strength, potentially favoring the fabrication of high-performance fiber-reinforced polymer composites [15,16,18]. On the contrary, the mechanical properties of lignin-based resins in terms of strength, Young's modulus, and adhesion strength need to be improved from the current status. Herein, we report an ultra-strong, tough, environment-friendly, Esterified Polyvinyl alcohol-Citric acid-Lignin (E-PCL) resin applicable to all-green fiber-reinforced polymer composites for the first time. We adopted a facile, cost-effective, scalable, and green solution mixing approach to synthesize Hydrogen-bonded PVA-CA-Lignin (H-PCL) resin with different weight ratios of citric acid (CA) as a cross-linker. The H-PCL was heated at 180 °C to form E-PCL resin. To the best of our comprehension, no reports have been made on all-green NF-reinforced polymer composite. Therefore, the suitability of E-PCL resin for NF-reinforced polymer composites was investigated by characterizing its chemical structure, thermal behavior, mechanical properties, adhesion strength, and water contact angle. The optimized environment-friendly E-PCL resin was utilized in the fabrication of all-green NF-reinforced polymer biocomposite. The flexural properties, thermal stability, and water contact angle of the composite were also characterized."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The citric acid (99%), low sulfonate content (sulfur content ≤ 3.6 % ) lignin alkali (lignin, kraft) with an average molecular weight of 10,000 g/mol, and poly(vinyl alcohol) (99% hydrolyzed) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, Missouri, USA)."
3,"Preparation of PVA, lignin, and citric acid solutions","2.2 Preparation of PVA, lignin, and citric acid solutions 20 g of PVA was placed in a 500 ml 3-neck round bottom flask, after which 180 g of deionized water was charged into the flask. The solution was heated at 90 °C in a heating mantle for 3 hrs to dissolve the PVA then cooled to room temperature. Subsequently, 15 g of lignin alkali was also dissolved in 85 g deionized water under constant magnetic stirring for 4 hrs. The lignin solution was then homogenized using a sonicator (HD 2200, Bandelin electronic Co., Berlin, Germany) at 72% power for 10 mins. The PVA and lignin solutions were then centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 40 mins to remove undissolved particles. The weight percent of the lignin solution was then adjusted by diluting the centrifuged solution. The resulting Lignin (pH 8.98 ± 0.03) and PVA solutions were confirmed to be 10w%. Next, the PVA-Lignin (PL) solution was directly mixed at a ratio of 65:35 using a magnetic stirrer for 12 hrs, after which the solution was homogenized for 20 mins under an ice bath. The solution was further mixed using a magnetic stirrer for 24 hrs. Finally, 15 g citric acid was dissolved in 135 g deionized water under magnetic stirring."
4,Preparation of H-PCL and E-PCL resins,"2.3 Preparation of H-PCL and E-PCL resins Hydrogen bonded (H-PCL) resins were prepared by loading 10 wt% CA into 10 wt% PL solution at different ratios of 9:1, 8:2, 7:3, 6.5:3.5, and 6:4 (Fig. S1). H-PCL blend resin was meticulously mixed for 30 min using a magnetic stirrer then homogenized for 10 min in an ice bath to circumvent thermal effects. H-PCL resin was cast on a petri dish and dried at room temperature for 48hrs followed by additional drying at 60 °C in the oven for 24 hrs. All H-PCL films had comparable thicknesses (Fig. S1). H-PCL resin films were heated at 180 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven to obtain the E-PCL films as depicted in Fig. 1 . The 10w% H-PCL was used to optimize the esterification time, as shown in Fig. S3a."
5,Mechanical characterization,"2.4 Mechanical characterization 2.4.1 Tensile and flexural properties The mechanical properties of the PL, H-PCL and E-PCL (12 replicates) were examined via tensile tests (T0-102C) at 25 °C/40 %RH (Fig. 1a). The tests were conducted at a crosshead speed of 2.4 mm/min. The flexural properties of the composite (4 replicates) were analyzed as per ASTM D790 standards at a strain rate of 1 mm/min. 2.4.2 Lap shear joint (LSJ) test of E-PCL resin with cellulose film A commercial cellulose film was cut into rectangular specimens of 20 mm by 10 mm. The adhesive area of E-PCL resins was 1 mm × 10 mm. A silkscreen printing was adopted to obtain a uniform adhesive thickness of the resins on the cellulose film, and the joints were adroitly assembled and pressed under a constant load to eliminate excess resin (Fig. 1a). The cellulose film/H-PCL specimen samples were cured in a vacuum oven at 180 °C. LSJ tests were performed using the tensile machine at a strain rate of 1 mm/min. The adhesion strength was calculated from the formula τ = F / A where τ denotes the adhesion strength, F is the failure load, and A is the adhesive area [15,16]."
6,Water contact angle,"2.5 Water contact angle The water contact angle of PCL-based resins and NF/E-PCL30 biocomposites was measured by an optical tensiometer (GSA, Surfacetech Co., Ltd. Korea). The samples (PL, H-PCL, E-PCL and E-PCL/CNF were fixed on a glass slide and the WCA from a single water droplet (13.69 ± 0.02 µl) was automatically computed by the equipment."
7,Fabrication of NF/E-PCL30 composites and characterization,"2.6 Fabrication of NF/E-PCL30 composites and characterization The isolation of cellulose nanofiber is highlighted in the Supporting Information. The spinning dope for NF was prepared according to previous reports [25,26]. The winding system was marginally modified to incorporate two advancing spinning rollers (R1 and R2) in addition to a winding spool (R3), as shown in Fig. 2 . Plain-weave wet-pun NF mats were deftly knit on a loom (Fig. S2). Three wet-spun NF mats were dipped in H-PCL30 resin for 2 h and assembled as shown in video S1. The assemblage was dried at room temperature for 48hrs followed by oven drying at 80 °C for 48 hrs and 100 °C for 3 h to eliminate residual moisture content. The biocomposite was hot-pressed at 180 °C for 5 min at a pressure of 10.1 MPa, the applied pressure on the hot press being 1.5 MPa. To obtain the esterified NF/E-PCL30 composites, the partially cured NF/H-PCL30 was post-cured at 180 °C in a vacuum oven (Fig. 2)."
8,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1a delineates the synthesis of the H-PCL resin by cross-linking of PVA-Lignin (PL) with CA, followed by esterification at 180 °C to form E-PCL resin. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of E-PCL10 resins, where 10 indicates the CA content, were taken to confirm the covalent ester bond and optimize the esterification time (Fig. S1a). After esterification of H-PCL10, the absorption band at 1701 cm−1, corresponding to the hydrogen bond between COOH and OH groups, shifted towards the higher wavenumber — 1729 cm−1 — which denotes an ester bond [16,27,28]. Meanwhile, the broadband at 3418 cm−1 of the H-PCL10 slightly changed to a sharp band, attributed to the OH group stretching. With the increase in the esterification time, the intensity of ester and –CH stretching band increased due to more interaction between COOH and OH groups. Hence, 12hrs was taken as the optimum esterification time for all the resins. The FTIR results indicate successful ester bond formation between lignin and PVA with CA cross-linker. Fig. 3 a depicts the stress–strain curves of E-PCL resins as a function of CA content from 0 to 40 wt%. A summary of H-PCL and E-PCL's mechanical properties compared to previously reported data is also given in Table 1 . Compared to the neat PL resin, a drastic reduction in mechanical properties of H-PCL arose upon CA loading from 0 to 40w%, as shown in Fig. S7 and Table S1. On the other hand, the esterification of H-PCL at 180 °C induced remarkable enhancement of tensile strength, strain-at-break, stiffness, and toughness of E-PCL resins, as noticeable in Fig. 3a–b. Salient augmentation in mechanical properties was realized at 30w% CA loading. Concretely, with relation to H-PCL30, the tensile strength, strain, elastic modulus, and toughness increased by 269.8%, 177.5%, 273.5, and 1222.8%, respectively. This increase in mechanical properties is attributed to the transformation of the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups to ester bonding during the heat treatment, as shown in Fig. S3a and Fig. S3b. However, over 30 wt% CA loading, drastic reduction in mechanical properties of the resins transpired due to the excessive esterification as depicted in Fig. 3a and Fig. S3. This phenomenon signifies a high degree of cross-linking hence the brittleness. In the previous reports shown in Table 1, lignin-based resins such as PVA-lignin, esterified PVA-maleic acid-lignin, lignin-PEO, and lignin-epoxy displayed a tensile strength of 41.1 MPa, 48.5 MPa, 6.2 MPa, and 67.5 Mpa, respectively [15,16,18,29]. Consequently, E-PCL30 offers ideal mechanical performance among the previously reported lignin-based resins. Interfacial adhesion governs the mechanical properties of fiber-reinforced polymer composites [33,34]. Consequently, excellent adhesion strength is an indispensable prerequisite for high-performance composites. The feasibility of E-PCL resins on nanocellulose composites was investigated by performing single lap joint shear tests as delineated by Fig. 1a and Fig. 4 a–b. The tests were conducted as per the previous report [16] using cellulose film. A homogeneous adhesive thickness of approximately 1.4 µm, as portrayed in Fig. 4a, was achieved by utilizing silkscreen printing. The adhesion strength of the resins improved significantly upon cross-linking by CA with a maximum adhesion strength of 31.92 ± 1.47 MPa at 30 w% CA. This sturdy adhesion strength is linked to the optimum cross-linking and the dimpled microstructure that renders the surface rough (Fig. 5 b and Fig. S4c). An optimal roughness provides additional contact surface area and interfaces for mechanical interlocking, while surface irregularities may aid in crack mitigation hence stronger and fatigue resistant bonds [35–37]. This report is promising given the 369.4% improvement in adhesion strength compared to an earlier study shown in Table 1 [16]. Hence, the new resin may be more suitable for NF-reinforced polymer composites. The hydrophilic nature of resins and natural fibers affects the fiber–matrix adhesion properties owing to moisture absorption, which degenerates the adhesion strength [38–40]. Thus, the surface property of the prepared resins was characterized by water contact angle (WCA) measurement. Fig. 5a and Fig. S5-6 present the WCA of the neat PL, H-PCL, and E-PCL resins. The neat PL and H-PCL resins showed WCA between 29.5 and 82.7°, which are lower than the E-PCL resins. It is because the H-PCL resins have more hydroxyl groups on their surfaces than the E-PCL resins. The WCAs increased significantly with CA loading and heat treatment, as shown in Fig. 5a and Fig. S5–6. Specifically, the E-PCL30 revealed 104.4° WCA — 48.5% higher than the H-PCL30. The dimples observed on the surface and cross-section images of the E-PCL30 shown in Fig. 5b and Fig. S4c–d were ascribed to evaporation of water molecules during the esterification [16]. The excellent degree of cross-linking resulted in a compact structure while the surface microstructure impeccably ameliorated the surface roughness, which increased hydrophobicity. From classical wetting theory, it is well known that the surface roughness triggered by hierarchical patterns or structures is a necessity for hydrophobicity and self-cleaning [41,42]. From Fig. 5b and Fig. S4c–d, it can be hypothesized that the surface dimples did not affect the mechanical properties of E-PCL30. Thus, by utilizing E-PCL resin, strength and hydrophobic properties can be imparted to NF-reinforced polymer composites devoid of toxic chemicals or time-consuming etching techniques. At 35 w% and 40 w%, the diminished surface microstructure (Fig. 5c and Fig. S4e) reduces surface roughness, decreasing its hydrophobicity. The decrease in surface roughness may be attributed to excessive CA content. Analogous findings were disclosed in the report on esterified PVA-maleic acid-lignin [16]. Based on the reports, it is apparent that the E-PCL30 is far much superior to these resins. Thus, the findings in our report offer a systematic yet effective mechanism to impart hydrophobic properties to high-performance and all-green composites in a slick and environment-friendly manner. Ultimately, the high-performance E-PCL30 resin was used to fabricate the all-green NF-reinforced polymer composite — the first scientific report for all-green FRPC with long nanocellulose filament and E-PCL resin. The NF/E-PCL30 composite exhibited flexural stress of 363.42 ± 10.76 MPa with a flexural modulus of 39.89 ± 2.66 GPa, as depicted in Fig. 6a. This outstanding performance may be linked to the superior mechanical properties of the resin and NF in addition to the splendid adhesion of the resin to the filament (Fig. 4b), resulting in ample load transfer at the fiber–matrix interface. For comparison, three woven jute mats were used to fabricate a composite using H-PCL30 resin to assert the enhanced strength of NF/E-PCL30 due to the splendid interfacial adhesion. The fabrication and processing parameters are analogous to the NF/H-PCL30 and NF/E-PCL30. As depicted in Fig. 6a, the Jute/E-PCL30 displayed a flexural strength of 97.88 ± 6.61 MPa and a flexural modulus of 9.39 GPa. Though jute fibers exhibit mechanical properties comparable to NF, this relatively low mechanical performance may be linked to the lignin content, wax or oil, and the excessive hemicellulose content in the jute fibers. The lignin and hemicellulose cement the crystalline cellulose microfibrils in jute fibers. Jute fibers are believed to overlap each other to form a mesh-like structure, reducing the active surface area for resin wetting and bonding [43]. Nanocellulose filament, on the other hand, presents an excellent adhesion to E-PCL30 since the elimination of lignin, hemicellulose, and other impurities result in a compact rearrangement of the fibrils hence a dense packing of cellulose nanofibers. Consequently, the crystallinity of the nanocellulose filaments is greatly improved, thus the excellent mechanical properties. The NF/E-PCL30 composite morphology was examined by observing cross-section SEM images of the fracture surface as shown in Fig. 6b-c. The SEM image portrays a good interaction between NF and the resin without any fiber pull-out phenomenon perceived. In addition, the rectangular area and the yellow arrows indicate the interfacial boundaries between NF and E-PCL30 resin, which validate the good interfacial interactions. Fig. 6d presents the thermal stability of E-PCL30 resin and NF/E-PCL30 composite. The composite exhibits the main degradation around 242 °C, similar to the E-PCL30 resin. However, in contrast to the composite, the weight loss in the E-PCL30 commenced at 85 °C due to the degradation of OH and COOH groups. On the other hand, the composite displayed no weight loss at 85 °C, which might be due to the cross-linking of OH and COOH groups in the E-PCL with the OH groups of cellulose chains in NF. A detailed description of the thermal stability of H-PCL and E-PCL resins is given in Fig. S8. The WCA of the prepared composite was also characterized, as shown in Fig. S9. The composite displayed a WCA of 93.71 ± 2.52°. This value is about 10.2% lower than the E-PCL30 resin. The WCA reduction for the composite is attributed to the hot pressing, which disrupted the resin's surface microstructure (Fig. S4c). However, the hydrophobic level achieved for the composite in this work is acceptable since no toxic chemicals or etching techniques were employed."
9,Conclusion,"Succinctly, this is the first report to delineate the fabrication of all-green FRPC made with the novel nanocellulose filament and lignin-based resin. The composite simultaneously achieves an ultrahigh flexural strength (363.42 MPa) and flexural stiffness (39.89 GPa). This study unveils the potential of cellulose towards the fabrication of lightweight, strong, and tough structural composites tailored for automotive, aerospace, and structural engineering. Under the intensifying trepidation encircling the depletion of natural resources and degeneration of the environment, the focus must be redirected to sustainable development to preserve the beauty of our ecosystem. With its vast and sustainable raw material supply, nanocellulose stands to offer a range of materials applicable for nearly all aspects of life. Current technologies such as hydrodynamic alignment of nanocellulose filaments, microfluidic spinning, magnetic and electric field alignment techniques could be used to enhance the impact of this report on the design and engineering of high-performance and all-green fiber-reinforced polymer composites. Moreover, as scientists and engineers strive to acquire a deeper comprehension of the widening scope and range of sustainable polymers, it is vital to reflect on how much can be achieved from the hierarchical structure of cellulose towards a sustainable and carbon–neutral ecosystem."
