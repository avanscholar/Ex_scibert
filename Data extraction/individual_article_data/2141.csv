0,Introduction,"Hydrogen gas (H2) is a clean and renewable energy carrier, and its product with oxygen is water. Methods of H2 production are mainly divided into two types: chemical-physical and biological. The chemical-physical methods (e.g., water electrolysis, hydrocarbon reformation) are energy intensive and expensive [1]. Biological hydrogen production by microorganisms, a technological development offering usable hydrogen, particularly as stationary energy sources, is more environmentally friendly and has been the subject of intensive research [2–4]. In addition, biohydrogen production provides a method for the disposal of organic wastewater and for transforming biomass into an energy source [5]. In order to enhance H2 production, culture conditions such as the C/N and C/P ratios [6], carbon sources, pH, and temperature have been widely studied [7–11]. Metal ions can significantly influence enzyme activities related to hydrogen production [12]. Previous studies showed that the addition of Fe2+ to the culture solution in the H2 fermentation bioreactor was beneficial for enhancing hydrogenase activity, hydrogen production, substrate utilization, and shortening acclimation time [13–15]. l-cysteine is a reducing agent, which is able to reduce the oxidation reduction potential (ORP) and increase cell growth rate, also commonly used in anaerobic culture media [16]. Ding (2006) and Yuan et al. (2008) found that hydrogen production by mixed culture substantially increased when 0.1–1.0 mM l-cysteine was added to the nutrient solution [17,18]. Although the effects of the iron ion (Fe2+) on H2 production by mixed culture have been studied [13–15], the effects of Mg2+ and l-cysteine concentrations on hydrogen production by pure culture are unknown. Hydrogenases (H2ases) catalyze the reversible oxidation of molecular hydrogen (H2), play a critical role in microbial energy metabolism [19] and are classified into three types: [NiFe]-H2ases, [FeFe]-H2ases and [Fe]-H2ases [20]. [FeFe]-hydrogenases (hydA) are generally associated with the formation of H2, which occurs in anaerobic bacteria such as Clostridium, Thermotoga, Desulfovibrio and Ethanoligenens [21,22]. In the last two decades, the characterization and genetic modification of hydrogenases from Clostridium [23–25], Enterobacter [26], and Ethanoligenens [22] have been performed. In recent years, the hydA gene was developed as a biomarker to survey microbial ecology in natural or engineered environments [27–29], and to determine the relationship between H2 production and operation parameters [30–32]. And, a few studies on hydA gene expression in Clostridium butyricum during hydrogen production have recently been reported [33,34]. To date, the relationship between metal ions or l-cysteine and hydA gene expression in hydrogen production bacteria is unclear. In this study, the effects of l-cysteine, iron and magnesium ions on cell growth, fermentation byproducts and hydrogen yield of Clostridium beijerinckii RZF-1108 were studied in batch culture. The relationship between hydrogen production and hydA gene expression in different concentrations of l-cysteine, iron and magnesium was assessed and analyzed using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Batch culture for hydrogen production,"2.1 Batch culture for hydrogen production The pure culture of C. beijerinckii RZF-1108 used in this study was isolated from a hydrogen-producing bioreactor, maintained in our laboratory, and investigated for its characteristic and optimal culture condition in previous study [35]. Batch experiments for hydrogen production were carried out in 100-ml anaerobic culture bottles. The bottles containing 50 ml of liquid medium were flushed with ultra high-pure nitrogen gas (99.999%) for 5 min, sealed with a rubber plug, and autoclaved at 121 °C for 15 min. The solution used for hydrogen production was PYG medium (1 L) containing 10 g glucose, 3 g peptone, 1 g yeast extract, 21.5 g Na2HPO4·12H2O, 8.1 g KH2PO4·2H2O, 0.1 g MgCl2·6H2O, 0.1 g FeSO4·7H2O, 0.5 g l-cysteine, 10 ml mineral salt solution (containing 0.01 g/l MnSO4·7H2O, 0.05 g/l ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.01 g/l H3BO3, 0.01 g/l CaCl2·2H2O, 0.01 g/l Na2MoO4, 0.2 g/l CoCl2·6H2O, 0.01 g/l AlK(SO4)2·12H2O, 0.001 g/l NiCl·6H2O, 2.0 g/l N[(CH2)COO]3) and 10 ml vitamin solution (containing 0.01 g/l cobalamin, 0.025 g/l vitamin C, 0.025 g/l riboflavin, 0.02 g/l citric acid, 0.05 g/l pyridoxal, 0.01 g/l folic acid, 0.025 g/l creatine and 0.01 g/l P-aminobenzoic acid). The initial pH of 6.5 was adjusted by 1 mol/l HCl or 1 mol/l NaOH solution. In order to examine the effects of l-cysteine, iron and magnesium on hydrogen production, PYG medium was supplemented with 0–2.0 g/l l-cysteine or 0–1.0 g/l MgCl2·6H2O, or 0–0.3 g/l FeSO4·7H2O. The culture medium without Mg2+, Fe2+ or l-cysteine was considered the negative control. Cells in the logarithmic growth phase were inoculated into anaerobic bottles at 6% (V/V). The bottles were shaken in an air bath at 35 °C and 140 rpm. The gas was collected by the draining method after cultured for 20 h."
3,Analytical methods,"2.2 Analytical methods Glucose was measured by a glucose assay kit (Rongsheng Biotech, Shanghai, China) using the peroxidase method. Biomass was measured as cell dry weight (CDW) according to a previously described method [36]. Hydrogen content, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohol were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 4890) as previously described [29]."
4,Nucleic acid extraction and template preparation,"2.3 Nucleic acid extraction and template preparation Genomic DNA extraction was carried out using the Bacterial DNA Mini Kit (Watson Biotechnologies, China). Cell cultures were harvested from the bottles at exponential phase [37]. Extraction of total RNA was carried out in triplicate from 1 ml of liquid cultured bacteria using the RNeasy Protect Bacteria Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA), and the RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen, USA) for DNA removal. The integrity of DNA and RNA samples was analyzed by electrophoresis using 0.8% (wt/vol) agarose, and the concentration and purity were determined by a Beckman DU 800 (Beckman, USA) at 260 nm and 280 nm. The PCR products were purified using the Gel Extraction Mini Kit (Watson Biotechnologies, China), and cloned with the pMD19-T plasmid vector system (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) for sequencing. The [FeFe]-hydrogenase-specific primer pair of Cb-hydF175 (5′-TTA ACA TCT TGT TCT ACG CCA C-3′) and Cb-hydR400 (5′-TAT CTA AAG CCT TTT TTC CCT G-3′) for qRT-PCR were designed based on the [FeFe]-hydrogenase gene (GenBank accession number GQ375086) of C. beijerinckii RZF-1108, which has a similarity of 98% with hydA gene of C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052. For construction of the standard curve, recombinant plasmid of pMD19-T containing target PCR product was enriched in E. coli DH5α, isolated using a Plasmid Purification Mini Kit (Watson Biotechnologies, China), and diluted with EASY Dilution (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) from 100 to 10−7. The purity and content of isolated recombinant plasmid was determined using the same method as described above."
5,qRT-PCR analysis,"2.4 qRT-PCR analysis A PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) was used to perform reverse transcription of total RNA to cDNA. The reaction mixture contained 5 × PrimeScript buffer 2 μl, PrimeScript RT Enzyme Mix I 0.5 μl, random 6 mers (100 μM) 0.5 μl, total RNA 400 ng, ribonuclease inhibitor 20 U, RNase free dH2O up to 10 μl. Reverse transcription was performed at 37 °C for 15 min, followed by denaturation at 85 °C for 5 s and cooling at 5 °C for 5 min before PCR amplification. Quantitative PCR analysis was carried out in triplicate using an SYBR Premix Ex Taq Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 2 × SYBR Premix Ex Taq 25 μl, 1 μl for each primer (10 μM), 50 × ROX reference dye II 1 μl, and cDNA template or standard plasmid 4 μl. Amplification and detection were performed in an ABI PRISM 7500 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems), using the following program: initial denaturation 30 s at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 5 s at 95 °C, 34 s at 60 °C for fluorescence signal collection, then a dissociation stage of 15 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. A standard curve was constructed with the serially diluted recombinant plasmid containing the hydA insert (3.07 × 108 to 3.07 × 103 copies/μl). The results of cDNA analysis were normalized to the total RNA extracted from the samples."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of Fe2+ ion on hydrogen production,"3.1 Effect of Fe2+ ion on hydrogen production The hydrogen producing yield slightly increased from 1.28 to 1.50 mol H2/mol glucose when the Fe2+ concentration increased from 0 to 0.2 g/l, and then decreased when Fe2+ concentration further raised (Fig. 1 ). The cell dry weight (CDW) showed a similar trend and increased from 0.97 g/l to 1.26 g/l, then decreased. The maximum hydrogen yield and CDW of 1.50 mol H2/mol glucose and 1.26 g/l, respectively, were obtained when the Fe2+ (FeSO4·7H2O) concentration was 0.2 g/l. Glucose utilization, final pH (about 4.8) and VFAs composition did not significantly change under different Fe2+ concentrations. A maximum H2 production rate of 94.1 ml H2/g CDW h−1 with a CDW of 0.94 g/l was observed at 0.05 g/l of Fe2+. These results were similar as previous studies [13,15], and indicated that Fe2+ stimulated cell growth and hydrogen production at low concentration, and inhibition was observed when the Fe2+ concentration was over a certain level. Iron is a key component of the cytochrome and iron-sulfur proteins involved in electron transport. Our experimental results indicated that a suitable concentration of Fe2+ was able to increase cell growth and hydrogen production, thus, presumably iron might enhance hydrogen production via the stimulation of enzyme activity such as hydrogenase which contains [Fe-S] clusters in its active site [15,22]. Iron ions may influence the synthesis of ferredoxin which is related to hydrogen production in suitable concentration ranges [38–40]."
8,Effect of Mg2+ ion on hydrogen production,"3.2 Effect of Mg2+ ion on hydrogen production Hydrogen yield decreased significantly when the Mg2+ concentration increased from 0.1 to 1.0 g/l (Fig. 2 ). Presumably the decrease in H2 content from 47.6% to 15.6% may be the reason why the hydrogen producing yield decreased. The final pH showed the opposite trend to that of hydrogen producing yield. The VFAs did not change significantly. The maximum hydrogen yield of 1.51 mol H2/mol glucose was obtained at 0.1 g/l Mg2+ (MgCl2·6H2O), with a maximum CDW of 1.45 g/l and lowest final pH of 4.76. However, the H2 production rate of 66.03 ml H2/g CDW h−1 was low at that point, which implied that the enhancement of H2 production by Mg2+ resulted from an increase in cell biomass. For the control without Mg2+ ions, although a maximum hydrogen production rate of 152.9 ml H2/g CDW·h−1 was obtained, glucose utilization was low at about 75%, the bacterial cells did not grow in the first 24 h, and the hydrogen yield, byproducts production and CDW were much lower than those obtained with Mg2+ even in the first 48 h. So, the highest hydrogen production rate may be resulted from the inoculums. Magnesium ions are required for the activity of many enzymes and their functions of stabilize cell membranes. Our results showed that Mg2+ played an important role in the growth and hydrogen production of C. beijerinckii RZF-1108. And indicated that the cell growth of strain RZF-1108 was highly dependent on Mg2+ ions, and hydrogen production increased with the Mg2+ concentration increasing. But a significantly hydrogen production inhibition observed when the Mg2+ supplementation over a certain level about 0.4 g/l, even the CDW did not change too much. Magnesium ions are important for the metabolic activity of hydrogen-producing bacteria. For example, ATP exists in cells normally as a chelate of ATP and magnesium ions."
9,Effect of l-cysteine on hydrogen production,"3.3 Effect of l-cysteine on hydrogen production The maximum hydrogen yield of 1.73 mol H2/mol glucose, maximum production rate of 103.0 ml H2/g CDW h−1 and maximum CDW of 1.06 g/l were obtained in the absence of l-cysteine with a maximum glucose utilization of 98.5% and lowest final pH of 4.75 (Fig. 3 ). These results showed that the hydrogen producing yield, production rate and cell growth decreased, and the final pH increased with increasing l-cysteine concentration. Glucose utilization and VFAs production also showed the same trend. These results indicated that l-cysteine inhibited cell growth and hydrogen production in strain RZF-1108, which was not consistent with the results of a previous study [17,18]. Although the maximum hydrogen yield and CDW were obtained in the absence of l-cysteine, the oxidation reduction potential (ORP) decreased after l-cysteine was added. l-cysteine as a reducing agent is commonly supplied in anaerobic culture media to reduce ORP [16]. Low ORP is usually favored by mixed cultures of hydrogen-producing bacteria. However, l-cysteine is not an ideal stimulus for hydrogen production in strain RZF-1108."
10,Expression of the hydA gene,"3.4 Expression of the hydA gene A standard curve with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.99 was constructed, and dissociation analyses proved that the qRT-PCR results were reliable (the standard curve and dissociation curve see Figs. S1 and S2 in the supplement material). Fig. 4 shows the effects of metal ions and l-cysteine on hydA gene expression and H2 evolution by C. beijerinckii RZF-1108. The maximum hydrogen accumulation was 1901.2 ml H2/l medium, which was obtained when the Fe2+ concentration was 0.2 g/l, but the maximum hydA expression of 8.0 × 105 copies/ng extracted RNA was obtained when strain RZF-1108 was cultured with 0.1 g/l FeSO4·7H2O, which was approximately 8 times higher than that of the negative control (Fig. 4). The supplementation of Fe2+ not only enhanced the hydrogen producing yield and cell growth, but also stimulated hydA gene expression, which was consistent with previous studies [14,15]. The expression of hydA reached a maximum of 5.4 × 106 copies/ng extracted RNA in the absence of Mg2+, and then significantly decreased with increasing Mg2+ concentration (Fig. 4). The overall trend of hydrogen production rate and expression of hydA was basically the same, which also reached the maximum in the absence of Mg2+ and then decreased (Fig. 2). The expression of hydA in the presence of Mg2+ was 45 times less than that in the absence of Mg2+. The hydrogen content decreased when MgCl2·6H2O was greater than 0.4 g/l. Although Mg2+ did not stimulate the hydrogen production rate and hydA gene expression, it increased the biomass and hydrogen evolution, suggesting that the increase in cell biomass made more of a contribution to hydrogen production in the presence of Mg2+. The hydrogen production was inhibited when Mg2+ over the certain level maybe caused by low hydA gene expression. The expression of hydA was slightly lower in the absence of l-cysteine than in the presence of l-cysteine, the maximum value of 1.18 × 106 copies/ng extracted RNA was observed at 1 g/l of l-cysteine (Fig. 4). The hydrogen evolution and production rate had the same overall trend, that they were not enhanced by l-cysteine supplement. And the maximum hydrogen accumulation of 2177.0 ml H2/l medium was observed in the absence of l-cysteine. l-cysteine only slightly enhanced hydA expression, but cell biomass and hydrogen production by strain RZF-1108. The stimulation of hydA gene expression by l-cysteine, it was not enough to stimulate hydrogen evolution or hydrogen production rate (Figs. 3 and 4). Although some researchers have investigated the effects of metal ions and l-cysteine on bacterial cell growth and hydrogen production, to our knowledge, this is the first description of the effects of metal ions and l-cysteine on hydA gene expression. The above results indicate that the effects of Fe2+, Mg2+ and l-cysteine on hydrogen production by C. beijerinckii RZF-1108 are complicated. Hydrogen production was highly dependent on the cooperation of cell growth and hydA gene expression. The relationship between environmental factor of metal ions and l-cysteine and functional enzyme activity need further investigation."
11,Hydrogen production in the optimized medium,"3.5 Hydrogen production in the optimized medium Hydrogen yield was 0.71 mol H2/mol glucose in the absence of Fe2+, Mg2+ and l-cysteine. The lag time of bacterial growth was about 24 h, which was significantly longer than that observed in the medium supplemented with Fe2+ and Mg2+. In contrast, the maximum H2 production yield of 1.96 mol H2/mol glucose and production rate of 106.0 ml H2/l medium·h−1 were obtained when RZF-1108 was cultured in the optimized medium supplemented with 0.2 g/l Fe2+ (FeSO4·7H2O) and 0.1 g/l Mg2+ (MgCl2·6H2O). These results indicated that Fe2+ and Mg2+ were important for hydrogen production in C. beijerinckii RZF-1108."
12,Conclusion,"Suitable concentrations of Fe2+ enhanced hydrogen production, cell growth and hydA gene expression in C. beijerinckii RZF-1108. Mg2+ increased the biomass and hydrogen production, but did not stimulate hydrogen production rate and hydA gene expression. l-cysteine slightly stimulated hydA gene expression, but not hydrogen production in strain RZF-1108. Compared with l-cysteine, Fe2+ and Mg2+ were critical for enhancing hydrogen production in C. beijerinckii RZF-1108. The effects of metal ions and l-cysteine on hydrogen production by C. beijerinckii RZF-1108 are complicated. Hydrogen production was highly dependent on the cooperation of cell growth and hydA gene expression."
