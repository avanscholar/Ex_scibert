0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic water splitting reaction originates by the direct absorption of photons by a photocatalyst. A photocatalyst can be excited by photons with energy equal to or higher than its band gap energy, and then the photo-generated electrons and holes directly contribute to the decomposition of water into H2 and O2 [1]. It has been suggested that a photocatalyst can accelerate the water splitting reaction if its conduction and valence bands are located at appropriate potential levels, i.e. the conduction band should be more negative than the proton reduction potential level, and the valence band should be more positive than the water oxidation potential level [2,3]. The photo-generated electrons and holes that can migrate to the photocatalyst surface will reduce protons to H2 and oxidize water to O2. However, the photo-generated electrons and holes can recombine both in the bulk phase and on the photocatalyst surface in a very short time [1], resulting in lowering the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency. In addition, because the decomposition of water into H2 and O2 is an energy-consuming process, the backward reaction of H2 and O2 to H2O tends to occur preferentially [4–8], also resulting in low photocatalytic efficiency. Therefore, it is difficult to achieve photocatalytic hydrogen production from pure water. Adding some specific chemicals as hole scavengers into the water can offer simultaneously both photo-generated electron–hole separation and backward reaction suppression [9–15], resulting in photocatalytic activity enhancement. Various types of hole scavengers have been studied for the enhancement of hydrogen production from the photocatalytic water splitting [9–17]. Perovskite-type SrTiO3 has been used in photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production because its band structure suits the water redox potential levels. The redox potentials of the photo-generated electrons and holes of SrTiO3 are powerful enough to facilitate hydrogen and oxygen formation [18–20]. In addition, SrTiO3 has been shown to possess good structure stability as a host for metal loading [21,22]. Our previous work revealed that the mesoporous-assembled structure of SrTiO3 nanocrystals can enhance the photocatalytic activity for methyl orange photodegradation [23]. The photocatalytic activity enhancement by mesoporous-structured photocatalysts has also been studied and is confirmed by several articles [24–28]. According to the aforementioned observations, the objective of this work was to focus on the development of effective SrTiO3 photocatalysts for hydrogen production via photocatalytic water splitting. In this present work, photocatalytic water splitting over pristine mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 nanocrystal and Pt-loaded mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 nanocrystal photocatalysts was investigated comparatively. The performance of various hole scavengers on the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity over the SrTiO3 photocatalysts was also studied in order to obtain the best hole scavenger for the photocatalytic hydrogen production system. According to literature, alcohol is the most widely used hole scavenger, and it shows good photocatalytic hydrogen activity enhancement [13,25,26,29–31]. In addition, Na2SO3 is widely used as an oxygen scavenger in many applications, such as feedwater treatment to prevent corrosion [32], wastewater treatment [33], and photocatalytic hydrogen production [34]. Moreover, it has been suggested that d-glucose, a biomaterial, that is a building unit of all biomasses and that has high H content in its molecule, may be an effective hole scavenger. Therefore, this work also investigates the effectiveness of these hole scavengers (alcohol, Na2SO3, and d-glucose) on the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of the studied photocatalytic system. In addition, the dependence of the apparent activation energy and the photocatalytic enhancement ability on the methanol content (the most effective hole scavenger) and reaction temperature was examined."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Strontium nitrate (Sr(NO3)2, Merck Co., Ltd.), tetraisopropyl orthotitanate (TIPT, Merck Co., Ltd.), acetylacetone (ACA, S.D. Fine-Chem Ltd.), laurylamine (LA, Merck Co., Ltd.), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37% analytical grade, Labscan Asia Co., Ltd.), and anhydrous ethyl alcohol (EtOH, Italmar Co., Ltd.) were used as starting materials for the mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 photocatalyst synthesis. Chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6·6H2O, Aldrich Co., Ltd.) was used as a Pt precursor. Anhydrous methyl alcohol (MeOH, 99.8% purity, Labscan Asia Co., Ltd.), anhydrous ethyl alcohol (EtOH, 99.5% purity, Italmar Co., Ltd.), anhydrous iso-propyl alcohol (2-PrOH, BDH Laboratory Co., Ltd.), d-glucose (Ajax Finechem), and sodium sulfite (Na2SO3, Riedel-Dehaeh) were used as hole scavengers for the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity investigation. Commercially available SrTiO3 nanopowder (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) and TiO2 nanopowder (Degussa P-25, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) were also used for the comparative study on photocatalytic hydrogen production activity. All chemicals used in this study were used as received, without further purification."
3,Synthesis procedure of mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 photocatalysts,"2.2 Synthesis procedure of mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 photocatalysts The mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 nanocrystal photocatalysts, with and without Pt loading, were synthesized via the sol–gel process with the aid of a structure-directing surfactant under mild conditions [23]. An ACA/TIPT solution was prepared by adding 2.00g of ACA to 5.68g of TIPT at an equimolar proportion. A laurylamine hydrochloride (LAHC) solution was prepared by dissolving 1.02g of LA with an equimolar HCl (0.09g) in 50cm3 of EtOH. Then, 4.23g of Sr(NO3)2 was added to the LAHC solution with continuous stirring to obtain a clear solution of LAHC/Sr(NO3)2. For the case of the Pt-loaded mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 nanocrystal photocatalyst synthesized, H2PtCl6·6H2O of various amounts was added to the LAHC/Sr(NO3)2 solution to obtain different Pt loadings, as being analogous to Pt-loaded mesoporous-assembled TiO2 synthesized by the single-step sol–gel process [28]. Afterwards, the LAHC/Sr(NO3)2 or LAHC/Sr(NO3)2/H2PtCl6·6H2O solution was slowly dropped into the ACA/TIPT solution while stirring continuously to obtain the ACA/TIPT/LAHC/SrTiO3 or ACA/TIPT/LAHC/SrTiO3/H2PtCl6·6H2O solution with a LAHC-to-TIPT molar ratio of 0.25:1 and a Sr-to-Ti molar ratio of 1:1. Next, the resultant mixture was incubated at 80°C for 1d to obtain complete gel formation. The resulting gel was further dried at 80°C for 2d. Finally, the dried gel was calcined at 700°C with a heating rate of 1°Cmin−1, and after reaching 700°C, it was maintained for 4h to remove the surfactant and the remaining solvent from the dried gel to yield the mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 nanocrystal photocatalyst (the pristine SrTiO3) or the Pt-loaded mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 nanocrystal photocatalyst (the Pt-loaded SrTiO3)."
4,Photocatalyst characterization techniques,"2.3 Photocatalyst characterization techniques The crystallinity and purity of the synthesized and commercial photocatalysts were examined by X-ray diffraction (Rigaku, RINT-2100) with a rotating anode XRD generating monochromated CuKα radiation using the continuous scanning mode at a rate of 2°Cmin−1 and operating conditions of 40kV and 40mA. The crystallite size (D) was calculated from the line broadening of the corresponding X-ray diffraction peak according to the Debye–Scherrer equation [35]: D = K λ β cos ( θ ) where K is the Scherrer constant (0.89), λ is the wavelength of the X-ray radiation (0.15418nm for CuKα), β is the full width half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peak measured at 2θ, and θ is the diffraction angle. The photocatalyst morphologies and the existence of the loaded Pt were observed by a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEOL, JEM-200CX) at 200kV. The specimens for TEM analysis were prepared by ultrasonically dispersing pestled powders of the photocatalysts in 2-propanol and then placing drops of the suspension onto a Cu microgrid coated with a carbon film. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the photocatalysts were obtained by using a nitrogen adsorption–desorption apparatus (BEL Japan, BELSORP-18 PLUS) at a liquid nitrogen temperature of −196°C. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) approach, using adsorption data over the relative pressure ranging from 0.05 to 0.35, was employed to determine the specific surface areas of the studied photocatalysts. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) approach, using the desorption data, was used to obtain their mean pore size and pore size distribution. The diffuse reflectance spectra of the synthesized and commercial photocatalysts were obtained by using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2450) at room temperature with BaSO4 as the reference. Afterwards, the diffuse reflectance spectra were analyzed to estimate the band gap energy (E g, eV) by using the Kabelka–Munk function (F(r)), as expressed by the following equation [36]: F ( r ) = ( 1 − r ) 2 2 r where r is the ratio of the reflected light intensity to the reflected light intensity of the reference. The band gap wavelength (λ g, nm) was the wavelength at the crossing point between the line extrapolated from the onset of the rising part and the x-axis of the plot of F(r) as a function of wavelength (λ, nm). The E g was then determined by using the following equation [36]: E g = 1240 λ g The estimated error of E g determination was found to be ±0.02eV with a standard deviation of 0.7%. The actual Pt loading of the investigated SrTiO3 photocatalysts was analyzed by an X-ray fluorescence spectroscope (Phillip, WD-XRF PW-2400). The aggregated particle size distribution of the investigated SrTiO3 photocatalysts was analyzed by a light scattering particle size analyzer (laser technique) (Malvern/Mastersizer X, Malvern Instruments Ltd.), capable to measure in the range of 0.1–600μm with the standard deviation of the mean aggregated particle size in the range of −9 to 9μm. The oxidation state of the loaded Pt was analyzed by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) (Physical Electronics, PHI 5800 ESCA). A monochromatic Al Kα source emitting an X-ray energy of 1486.6eV was used as the X-ray source. The relative surface charging of the samples was removed by referencing all the energies to the C1s level as an internal standard at 284.8eV."
5,Photocatalytic water splitting experiments,"2.4 Photocatalytic water splitting experiments The photocatalytic activity of the synthesized and commercial SrTiO3 photocatalysts for the water splitting reaction was investigated by using the average hydrogen production rate during the first 5h irradiation period as an indicator. The photocatalytic water splitting experiment was performed in an outer-irradiation and air-tight Pyrex glass reactor (750ml), connected to a water-cooling system. A set of 176W Hg lamps (16 lamps, TUV 11W PL-S, Phillip), which emitted light of more than 95% with a wavelength of 254nm with total irradiance of 2.3mWcm−2, and a 300W Xe lamp (KXL-300, Wacom Electric) combined with a UV cutoff filter (ATG, B-485), which allowed only the visible light with wavelengths longer than 400nm to pass with total irradiance of 2.6mWcm−2, were employed as UV and visible light sources, respectively. In a typical experiment, a constant photocatalyst dosage of 1×10−3 gcm−3 was suspended in an aqueous solution with different hole scavengers by using a magnetic stirrer. Prior to the reaction testing, the suspension was left in the dark while simultaneously being thoroughly deaerated by purging with Ar gas for 20min, and then the suspension was irradiated by turning on the lamps for 5h. For the UV irradiation, the reaction temperature was controlled at three levels: 15, 30, and 45°C. For the visible light irradiation, the reaction was performed at room temperature of 27°C. A gas sample in the headspace of the studied reactor was periodically withdrawn at 1h intervals and analyzed for its hydrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide concentrations by using a gas chromatograph (Hayesep D100/120, Perkin Elmer) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The average hydrogen production rate during the first 5h irradiation period was used to determine the quantum efficiency (QE) of the studied systems. The quantum efficiency (QE) was calculated by using the following equation: QE = combustion energy of produced hydrogen irradiating photon energy QE = H c , H 2 ( J mo l − 1 ) × hydrogen production rate ( mol h − 1 ) total irradiance ( J h − 1 c m − 2 ) × irradiated area ( c m 2 ) × 100 % where H c , H 2 is the heat of combustion of hydrogen gas (Jmol−1). Moreover, the dependence data of the initial rate of hydrogen production for the first 0.5h irradiation time of the system operated at different MeOH concentrations and reaction temperatures were used to determine the apparent activation energy ( E ˆ a , kJmol−1) of the photocatalytic water splitting reaction based on two reaction temperature ranges: a low temperature range of 15–30°C (varying from 15, 20, 25, to 30°C) and a high temperature range of 30–45°C (varying from 30, 35, 40, to 45°C). The E ˆ a values of all systems were calculated based on the Arrhenius equation. The E ˆ a value was determined from the slope of the natural log of the initial rate of hydrogen production as a function of the reciprocal of the temperature, with the square of correlation coefficient (R 2) in the range of 0.97–0.99. The E ˆ a value was then calculated by using the following equation: E ˆ a = ( − 1 ) × ( slope × R ) where R is the gas constant, 8.314Jmol−1 K−1."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Photocatalyst characterization results,"3.1 Photocatalyst characterization results The XRD patterns of the pristine SrTiO3, the 0.5wt.% Pt-loaded SrTiO3, and the commercial SrTiO3 are shown in Fig. 1 . All investigated photocatalysts showed the single SrTiO3 phase, which is a cubic perovskite-type structure (JCPDS card no. 35-0734) [37], with high purity. The presence of the Pt co-catalyst phase was not observed by the XRD analysis. This is possibly due to the low loading and the high dispersion degree with small particle sizes of Pt throughout the mesoporous-assembled network. The crystallite sizes of all the photocatalysts, calculated from their XRD patterns, are 35, 35, and 33nm for the pristine SrTiO3, the 0.5wt.% Pt-loaded SrTiO3, and the commercial SrTiO3, respectively (Table 1 ). Table 1 presents a comparison of the physical and textural properties of the synthesized SrTiO3 and the commercial SrTiO3. The XRD results suggest that the addition of Pt does not affect the crystallite size of SrTiO3. In addition, the estimated particle sizes, from their TEM images (Fig. 2(a)–(c)), are 20–40nm for both the pristine SrTiO3 and the 0.5wt.% Pt-loaded SrTiO3, and 20–200nm for the commercial SrTiO3. From the results of the size analysis from those two methods, the estimated particle size of the synthesized SrTiO3 obtained from the TEM analysis was close to the crystallite size calculated from the XRD pattern, indicating that the synthesized SrTiO3 photocatalysts have a single crystal structure, while this was not the case for the commercial SrTiO3. It can be seen for the TEM images that the synthesized SrTiO3 photocatalysts have a much more uniform particle size than that of the commercial one and clearly exhibit the mesoporous structure (pore diameter between 2 and 50nm) formed between the SrTiO3 nanocrystals due to their assembly, as marked by a circle in Fig. 2(b) and (c); these are important characteristics of the synthesized SrTiO3 photocatalyst for the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity [23]. The porous structure of the synthesized SrTiO3 can be identified by the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. 3(a) and (b)) as their isotherms show a type IV IUPAC pattern with a hysteresis loop, implying that they mainly consist of well-developed mesopores in their assembled framework [38]. Both mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 photocatalysts (the pristine SrTiO3 and the Pt-loaded SrTiO3) exhibit high pore uniformity, according to their very narrow pore size distributions, as shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b). In contrast, the commercial SrTiO3 has a non-uniform particle size (Figs. 2(a), 3(c) and 4 ) with an average particle size much larger than its crystallite size (Table 1 and Fig. 4). From the adsorption–desorption isotherm results, the commercial SrTiO3 shows a type II IUPAC pattern without a hysteresis loop with a very broad pore size distribution, mainly in the macropore region (pore diameter>50nm) (Fig. 3(c)). However, the BET surface area of the commercial SrTiO3 photocatalyst is higher than those of both the pristine SrTiO3 and the Pt-loaded SrTiO3 photocatalysts, as shown in Table 1. From the results, the addition of Pt to the synthesized SrTiO3 did not significantly affect the purity, the specific surface area, the pore characteristics, the crystallite size, and the aggregated particle size (Table 1 and Fig. 4). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Fig. 2(d) and (e)) show the oriented and ordered lattice fringes for SrTiO3 photocatalyst and Pt nanoparticle, respectively. The d spacing values indicate that the loaded Pt exists as the metal form with the d spacing value of 0.23nm corresponding to the cubic Pt0 (111) lattice parameter [39] and likely exists as a separate phase on the SrTiO3 surface because the d spacing value of the SrTiO3 dose not change with the value of 0.39nm corresponding to the cubic perovskite SrTiO3 (110) lattice parameter [20,40]. The metallic form of the loaded Pt was confirmed by the deconvoluted Pt4f XPS spectra of the 0.5wt.% Pt-loaded SrTiO3 photocatalyst, as shown in Fig. 5 . The spectra shows doublet peaks appeared at 72.5 and 75.6eV, which can be attributed to the Pt4f7/2 and Pt4f5/2 levels of Pt0 oxidation state, respectively [41]. This suggests that the loaded Pt on the SrTiO3 photocatalyst was in the metallic form. According to the reflectance spectra results, i.e. the Kabelka–Munk function plots of the pristine and the 0.5wt.% Pt-loaded SrTiO3 photocatalysts (Fig. 6 ), they clearly indicate that the addition of Pt on the SrTiO3 surface can enhance the visible light harvesting ability and increase the band gap wavelength (λ g) of the synthesized SrTiO3 photocatalyst, leading to the decrease in the band gap energy from 3.23 to 3.16eV (Table 1). The presence of a Pt metal at the surface of SrTiO3 possibly results in the formation of a Schottky barrier at the Pt–SrTiO3 interface, which decreases the energy position of the SrTiO3 conduction band to its minimum potential level, leading to a decrease in the band gap energy of the synthesized SrTiO3 photocatalyst [42,43]."
8,Effects of type and concentration of hole scavenger,"3.2 Effects of type and concentration of hole scavenger The effects of type and concentration of hole scavengers on the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity over the 0.5wt.% Pt-loaded mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 nanocrystal photocatalyst were studied. The enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of the studied photocatalyst by adding different hole scavengers was found in the following order: MeOH>EtOH> d-glucose>2-PrOH>Na2SO3 (Fig. 7 ). In the case of Na2SO3, CoCl2 was added as a catalyst to accelerate the rate of the reaction between Na2SO3 and O2 to form Na2SO4, resulting in the suppression of the backward reaction. The use of MeOH provided the highest photocatalytic enhancement ability (the ability to increase the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity), as compared to the other studied hole scavengers, possibly because it has the highest ability to donate electrons to scavenge the valence band holes to preventing photo-generated charge recombination [44,45]. In a comparison among alcohols, the photocatalytic activity tended to increase with increasing alcohol concentration. For MeOH as the hole scavenger, the hydrogen production rate significantly increased in the MeOH concentration range of 0–20vol.%; beyond this range, it only slightly increased. Because the MeOH had the highest photocatalytic enhancement ability, it was selected as the hole scavenger in further investigations. The results of the set of preliminary experiments performed to determine the effects of MeOH concentration, the presence of the 0.5wt.% Pt-loaded SrTiO3 photocatalyst, and temperature on the photocatalytic activity in hydrogen production are shown in Fig. 8 . For all studied systems, no hydrogen was produced under dark conditions. In the case of no photocatalyst addition under light irradiation at two reaction temperatures of 15 and 45°C, hydrogen was produced from the pure MeOH system and the 50vol.% MeOH aqueous solution system, but was not observed from the pure H2O system (Fig. 8), indicating that MeOH itself can be decomposed by the photolysis into hydrogen. However, in the presence of the 0.5wt.% Pt-loaded mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 nanocrystal photocatalyst, hydrogen production by the photocatalysis was much higher than that by the photolysis. Moreover, it is clear that the investigated photocatalyst had lower photocatalytic activity in the pure H2O system, as compared with the pure MeOH system and the 50vol.% MeOH aqueous solution system. These experimental results confirm that the use of MeOH as a hole scavenger can greatly enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of the studied photocatalyst. The results show that the photocatalytic activity in hydrogen production increased with increasing temperature from 15 to 45°C, and the temperature affected the pure H2O system (without MeOH as the hole scavenger) more than the MeOH–H2O systems."
9,Effect of Pt loading,"3.3 Effect of Pt loading In this experimental part, the photocatalytic activity of the pristine mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 photocatalyst for hydrogen production via the photocatalytic water splitting using methanol as the hole scavenger was first comparatively investigated with that of two non-mesoporous-assembled photocatalysts: the commercial SrTiO3 and the reported highly active commercial TiO2 (P-25, specific surface area of 51.6m2 g−1, crystallite sizes of 21 and 30nm for the anatase and rutile phases (mixed phase), respectively). The results show that the synthesized mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 photocatalyst exhibited significantly higher photocatalytic activity under UV irradiation than both the commercial SrTiO3 and TiO2 photocatalysts (the hydrogen production rates of 156, 46, and 37μmolh−1 gcat −1, for mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3, commercial SrTiO3, and commercial TiO2 (P-25), respectively), even if the synthesized photocatalyst had lower specific surface areas when compared with the commercial photocatalysts (Table 1). This is possibly because the reactants and all products of this water splitting reaction have small molecular sizes, which can easily diffuse through either mesopore or macropore, but the mesoporous structure more efficiently provides the active site accessibility on the photocatalyst surface for the reactants, as compared to the macroporous one. Therefore, mesoporous-assembled structure of the nanocrystals with a high pore uniformity of the SrTiO3 photocatalyst plays a significant role in the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production via the photocatalytic water splitting. The synthesized mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 photocatalyst was used for the further investigation on the Pt co-catalyst loading effect on the photocatalytic activity in hydrogen production to determine the optimum amount of Pt to be incorporated into the mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 nanocrystal photocatalyst. Fig. 9 illustrates the H2 production rate under UV and visible light irradiation of the mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 nanocrystal photocatalysts with various Pt loadings. The comparative results of the photocatalytic activity of the pristine SrTiO3 and the Pt-loaded SrTiO3 indicate that the presence of Pt on the SrTiO3 photocatalyst surface can enhance the photocatalytic activity of the synthesized SrTiO3 photocatalyst under both UV and visible light irradiation. This is possibly due to the roles of Pt metal in creating a Schottky barrier with the conduction band of the SrTiO3 photocatalyst to reduce the band gap energy [42,43], resulting in enhancing the visible light harvesting ability, facilitating the interfacial electron transfer, accelerating the charge separation, and therefore acting as the photocatalytic active site [46,47]. The hydrogen production rate increased markedly with increasing Pt loading; but beyond the Pt optimum loading of 0.5wt.%, it decreased slightly with increasing Pt loading for both UV and visible light irradiation. These results can be explained in that the Pt has both a positive effect (as aforementioned) and a negative effect on the photocatalytic activity. The negative effect is that at a very high loading of Pt, it can behave as a recombination center between the photo-generated electrons and holes, resulting in the decrease in the photocatalytic activity [28]. From the present results, it can be concluded that an excess amount of Pt (beyond the optimum loading of 0.5wt.%) increases the probability of a recombination reaction, leading to a decrease in the hydrogen production rate."
10,Effect of MeOH concentration and reaction temperature,"3.4 Effect of MeOH concentration and reaction temperature A set of H2 production experiments under the conditions of a 500ml of MeOH aqueous solution, 0.5g of the 0.5wt.% Pt-loaded SrTiO3 photocatalyst, under UV irradiation, and with various MeOH concentrations (0, 5, 20, 40, 50, 60, 95, and 100vol.%) and reaction temperatures (15, 30, and 45°C) were performed to observe the effects of MeOH concentration and reaction temperature on the H2 production behavior of the studied systems to determine the most suitable conditions for hydrogen production from the photocatalytic water splitting using MeOH as the hole scavenger. The dependences of the H2 production rate and the H2 production enhancement by MeOH on the MeOH concentration at different reaction temperatures are shown in Fig. 10(a) and (b), respectively, while the H2 production enhancement by MeOH was calculated by the following equation: The hydrogen production enhancement by MeOH = ( the hydrogen production rate from the aqueous MeOH solution system ) − ( the hydrogen production rate from pure water system ) The dependence of the initial hydrogen production rate on the reaction temperature are used to calculate the apparent activation energy ( E ˆ a , kJmol−1) based on two reaction temperature ranges: a low temperature range of 15–30°C and a high temperature range of 30–45°C. The dependence of the apparent activation energy on the MeOH concentration is shown in Fig. 10(c). Additionally, in order to elucidate the hydrogen production behavior of the studied systems, the seven main sets of possible reactions [48–51] for hydrogen production are needed to be considered: First, photo-generated electrons and holes are produced by the photo-excited reaction: (1) SrTiO3 +hν→e− +h+ Second, the H+ species can be produced by three reactions: - H2O is dissociated to produce H+: (2) H2O→H+ +OH− and (3) H2O+h+ →H+ +OH - MeOH reacts with H2O and h+ to produce H+: (4) CH3OH+H2O+6h+ →CO2 +6H+ Third, H2 is formed by a reduction reaction: (5) 2H+ +2e− →H2 Fourth, the OH species can be produced by the photo-generated holes reacted with the OH− species: (6) OH− +h+ →OH Fifth, O2 production occurs by the photo-generated holes: (7) 2OH +2h+ →O2 +2H+ Sixth, H2O re-production occurs via a backward reaction: (8) O2 +4H+ +4e− →2H2O As shown in Fig. 10(a), an increase in either the MeOH concentration or the reaction temperature results in an increase in the H2 production rate. For the pure H2O systems, H2 is produced from the water decomposition reactions (Eqs. (2) and (3)) and the subsequent reduction reaction of the H+ species (Eq. (5)). O2 is produced from the reaction between the generated OH (formed by Eqs. (3) and (6)) and the photo-generated hole (h+) (Eq. (7)). For the MeOH aqueous solution systems, the H+ species is produced from both the H2O decomposition (Eqs. (2) and (3)) and MeOH–H2O–h+ reaction (Eq. (4)), resulting in the higher amount of H+ species in the solution, which are possibly further reduced to H2, as compared to that of the pure H2O system. Moreover, the MeOH–H2O reaction scavenges six photo-generated-holes (h+) per one mole of MeOH, resulting in the decrease in the O2 production as well as the backward reaction. Therefore, the MeOH aqueous solution systems show the higher hydrogen production rate than the pure water systems. O2 and CO2 are also possibly produced according to Eqs. (7) and (4), respectively. However, both O2 and CO2 cannot be detected under any given studied conditions. This is possibly because both O2 and CO2 are completely dissolved in the solution, due to their much higher water solubility values as compared to that of H2 (the solubility values of CO2, O2, and H2 in water at 1atm and 45°C are 800, 38, and 1.35mg/l, respectively [52]). The effect of the MeOH concentration on H2 production enhancement by MeOH at both reaction temperatures of 15 and 30°C (Fig. 10(b)) exhibited the similar trend; H2 production enhancement increases with increasing MeOH concentration until reaching a plateau after the 20vol.% MeOH concentration. In contrast, under the reaction temperature of 45°C (Fig. 10(b)), the H2 production enhancement continuously increases with increasing MeOH concentration, especially much more significantly at the MeOH concentrations higher than 50vol.%. When considering the dependence of the H2 production enhancement by MeOH on the reaction temperature, the H2 production enhancement by MeOH decreased with increasing reaction temperature from 15 to 45°C, except for the studied conditions of 45°C under high MeOH concentration (of about more than 75vol.% MeOH fraction). The dependence of the E ˆ a on the MeOH concentration at the two reaction temperature ranges is shown in Fig. 10(c). For the low reaction temperature range of 15–30°C, the E ˆ a value significantly decreased with increasing MeOH concentration from 5 to 20vol.%, and reached a plateau at all MeOH concentrations higher than 20vol.%. For the high reaction temperature range of 30–45°C, the E ˆ a value also significantly decreased with increasing MeOH concentration from 5 to 20vol.%, but reached a plateau only in the MeOH concentration range of 20–60vol.%. At the MeOH concentrations higher than 60vol.%, the E ˆ a value significantly increases with increasing MeOH concentration. The obvious changes in both the H2 production enhancement by MeOH and the E ˆ a value at a high MeOH concentration (greater than 75vol.%) under a high reaction temperature of 45°C imply that the MeOH–H2O reaction rate is possibly much improved."
11,Photocatalyst durability and reuse,"3.5 Photocatalyst durability and reuse The time course of H2 production under the best conditions over the 0.5wt.% Pt-loaded SrTiO3 photocatalyst under UV irradiation both in terms of the accumulative H2 production and the instantaneous H2 production rate is illustrated in Fig. 11 . The H2 formation was observed after a short irradiation time of about 30min, proving that the synthesized photocatalysts require a short induction period for hydrogen production, as shown in Fig. 11(a). The total H2 production increases with increasing irradiation time, but a decrease in the instantaneous H2 production rate was simultaneously observed, as shown in Fig. 11(b). The instantaneous H2 production rate dropped significantly at initiation, and the decreased trend in the instantaneous H2 production rate slowed with increasing irradiation time. The big initial drop of the H2 production rate is possibly due to the adsorption of various intermediate species, which are abruptly produced on the photocatalyst surface, leading to such a rapid decrease in available active sites of the photocatalyst. After 5h of irradiation, the light was turned off, and the system was left in the dark for a few hours; then the light was turned on to resume the reaction. Fig. 11 shows that both the accumulative H2 production and the initial instantaneous H2 production rate of the second irradiation period were as high as those of the first irradiation period, and their profiles looked similar to those of the first irradiation period (Fig. 11). These results indicate that the photocatalyst loses some active sites during the reaction by the adsorption of intermediate species. However, when the irradiation is halted and the system is kept in the dark for a few hours, the active sites are possibly recovered by desorption and/or a further reaction of the intermediate species. In addition, the spent photocatalyst was re-tested for its photocatalytic activity performance (Fig. 12 ). The spent photocatalyst showed the same photocatalytic H2 production ability as the fresh photocatalyst. The XRD results of the fresh and the spent photocatalysts indicate that there is no phase change of the spent photocatalyst during the reaction. Therefore, the durability of the photocatalyst is highly acceptable, potentially providing the benefit of the photocatalyst reuse."
12,Conclusions,"Pristine and Pt-loaded mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 nanocrystal photocatalysts were successfully synthesized via the sol–gel method with the aid of a structure-directing surfactant under mild conditions. According to the photocatalytic H2 production results, the photocatalyst structure, in the form of a mesoporous assembly of SrTiO3 nanocrystals, was found to be responsible for the enhancement of the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity. The mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 nanocrystal photocatalysts exhibited much higher photocatalytic activity than two non-mesoporous-assembled commercial photocatalysts: commercial SrTiO3 and commercial TiO2 (Degussa P-25). Pt co-catalyst loading was found to enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of the pristine mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 nanocrystal photocatalysts. Pt co-catalyst loading decreases the band gap energy of the SrTiO3 photocatalysts, resulting in an increase in the visible light harvesting ability and leading to photocatalytic activity enhancement. However, excessive Pt co-catalyst loading was found to have a negative effect on the photocatalytic activity, and an optimum Pt loading of 0.5wt.% was required to attain the highest photocatalytic enhancement ability. MeOH exhibited the highest photocatalytic hydrogen production enhancement ability, as compared to the other studied hole scavengers. MeOH behaves as both a hole scavenger to enhance H2 production and a reactant for providing the H+ species to form H2, depending upon the system conditions. The most suitable system conditions for H2 production from water splitting in this work were a 0.5wt.% Pt-loaded mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 nanocrystal photocatalyst, a 50vol.% MeOH aqueous solution, and a 45°C reaction temperature. This system provided the average hydrogen production rates of 276 and 188μmolh−1 gcat −1, with the quantum efficiencies of 1.9 and 0.9%, under UV and visible light irradiation, respectively."
