0,Introduction,"Cinnamaldehyde (CAL) is an important intermediate derived from the lignin upgrade process [1]. The cinnamaldehyde molecule has a phenyl group with conjugated olefin (CC) and aldehyde (HCO) functionalities. The selective hydrogenation of the carbon–carbon double bond (CC) and carbonyl group (CO) of CAL results in the formation of the unsaturated aldehyde, hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL), and the unsaturated alcohol, cinnamyl alcohol (COL), respectively [2]. Hydrogenation of the olefinic bond (CC) is thermodynamically preferable over carbonyl (CO) functionality hydrogenation [3]. Both products are widely used as flavouring agents, perfumes, and fragrances, and are also used in the production of pharmaceutical intermediates and chemicals. HCAL was found to be an important intermediate in the production of cinnamic acid, which is used for the preparation of protease inhibitors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment [2–7]. COL also has applications in the production of photosensitive polymers, manufacture of inks for multicolour printing, animal repellents, and insect attractants [8]. Successive hydrogenation of olefinic (CC) and aldehyde (HCO) functionalities of CAL results in fully saturated alcohol viz., hydrocinnamyl alcohol (HCOL; 3-Phenyl-1-Propanol) [6,9]. HCOL is used as a food flavouring agent or adjuvant and has a fragrance with a floral character, which is reminiscent of lily rose and hyacinth, and is used as a fragrance ingredient in cosmetic products, such as perfumes, shampoos, and personal care products, soaps, detergents, fabric softeners, candles, and incense [10,11]. In general, the products generated by the hydrogenation of CAL mainly depend on various factors, such as nature of metal species present on the catalyst and its exposed face, particle size, and morphology. Furthermore, the product distribution also depends on promoters, structure, and texture of the support and its electronic effects in addition to reaction conditions and solvents [3,8]. Noble metal catalysts are generally used for the hydrogenation of CAL since they possess high activity under mild reaction conditions. Among the various noble metals, palladium and platinum (Pd and Pt, respectively) catalysts preferably hydrogenate the olefinic (CC) and aldehydic (HCO) bonds of cinnamaldehyde to yield HCAL and COL as the major products [12–19]. The capability of Noble metals to selectively hydrogenate CAL to COL follows the order osmium > iridium > platinum > ruthenium > rhodium > palladium (Os > Ir > Pt > Ru > Rh > Pd) [26]. Often Ru-based catalysts hydrogenate both olefinic (CC) and aldehydic (HCO) functionalities of CAL to yield HCAL and HCOL as the major products [8,20–27]. A few reports are available concerning the complete functional group hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to form saturated alcohol. Ma et al. prepared Pt nanoparticles supported on C nanotubes with inner diameters between 60 and 100 nm, which completely hydrogenated both CO and CC bonds of CAL to form a saturated alcohol [28]. Asedegbega-Nieto et al. reported that ruthenium/copper and nickel/copper (Ru/Cu and Ni/Cu, respectively) supported on graphite material, catalyses the hydrogenation of CAL with 60% and 80% composition of HCAL, respectively [29]. Chang et al. reported 97% conversion of CAL with high selectivity (97%) to HCOL using 4 wt% Pt on a graphite composite [9]. Recently, we have demonstrated that bimetallic the Ni/Ru catalyst acts as a potential hydrogenation catalyst for complete hydrogenation of a lignin-derived model compound eugenol [30,31]. In view of this process, the synergetic effect of bimetallic Ni/Ru species and the basicity of hydrotalcite (HT) support for complete functional group hydrogenation of CAL to form HCOL was explored in the present study."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Nickel-ruthenium containing magnesium/aluminium hydrotalcite (MANR–HT) was prepared by a co-precipitation method using the following procedure. First, solution A was prepared by mixing 39.15 mmol of Mg(NO3)2 and 13.05 mmol of Al(NO3)2, 0.75 mmol of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, and 0.25 mmol of ruthenium chloride (RuCl3·3H2O) in 96 mL of water. Solution B was prepared by mixing 25.79 mmol of (NH4)2CO3 and 31.47 mmol of NH4OH in 85 mL of water. Solution B was slowly added to solution A with vigorous stirring at 65 °C. The mixture was allowed to stir for 2 h after the complete addition of a basic solution. The pH of the solution was maintained at 8.5 and allowed to incubate for 24 h at 65 °C. The suspension was filtered, washed with distilled water, and dried overnight at 70 °C. The sample was labelled as MANR–HT (Mg/ Al ratio 3:1). Other samples were also prepared with Mg/Al ratio of 1:1 and 2:1 and were labelled as MANR (1-1) HT and MANR (2-1) HT. For comparison, MA–HT, monometallic Ni and Ru, bimetallic Ni/Rh and Ni/Ir species containing hydrotalcite materials were also prepared by maintaining the Mg/Al ratio at 3:1 and were labelled as MA–HT, MAN–HT, MAR–HT, MANRh–HT, and MANI–HT, respectively."
3,Material characterisation,"2.2 Material characterisation The functional groups present in samples were followed using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) using a JASCO-4700 spectrometer with a spectral range from 4000 to 400 cm−1 at a spectral resolution of 4 cm−1 and 64 scans. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured using a Rigaku miniflex (300/600), Japan X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54059 Å) in the 2θ range of 3–70° with a scan speed and step size of 0.005 min−1 and 0.05°, respectively. Thermal analysis of the sample was performed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) on a simultaneous thermal analyser (STA 600, PerkinElmer) from room temperature to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C per minute. The reducibility of the materials was determined by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) studies using BELCAT-M (JAPAN). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the resulting materials was carried out using Phillips Technai G2 T30 scanning electron microscope at 300 kV. The textural properties of the samples were determined by nitrogen sorption isotherms using a physisorption analyzer (BELSORP II, Japan) at −196 °C. Surface areas and pore volumes were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BET and BJH) methods, respectively."
4,Hydrogenation reaction,"2.3 Hydrogenation reaction The hydrogenation of CAL was carried out in a stainless autoclave reactor with a 50 mL Teflon beaker. In a typical procedure, 5 mmol of CAL was dissolved in 5 mL isopropanol, and 0.05 g of catalyst was dispersed in the solution. The reactor was sealed, purged with H2, and then pressurized to 1.0 MPa. The reaction was conducted at 150 °C for 10 h. After completion of the reaction, the catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture and analysed with a Mayura Analytical 1100 series gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector (FID) and ZB-5 column."
5,Results and discussions,"The FT-IR spectra (Figs. S1and S2) of as-prepared Ni/Ru containing HT samples exhibited typical vibrational bands representative of HT character. The stretching mode vibrations of hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl groups was observed as a broad peak in the 3400 cm−1 regions. The bending mode vibrations of H-O–H from interlayer water molecules was observed at 1640 cm−1. The band observed at 1340 cm−1 corresponded to the γ 3 stretching mode of interlayer carbonate anions. The bands in the region below 1000 cm−1 corresponded to M–O (773 cm−1) and M–O–M (644 cm−1) vibrations, respectively [30–34]. XRD patterns of Ni/Ru containing HT materials are displayed in Fig. 1 . All of the samples exhibited typical characteristics diffraction patterns of HT-like materials with reflections appearing at 2θ values of 11.5, 23.5, 35.2, 39.7, 45.7, 60.8, and 62.2° that corresponded to (003), (006), (009), (015), (018), (110), and (113) planes [30–34]. The catalyst prepared with Ni/Rh and Ni/Ir containing HT materials also displayed similar XRD profiles (Fig. S3). The TGA profile of MANR-HT sample is displayed in Fig. 2 . The TGA profile shows two distinct weight losses, which are characteristic of HT. The first stage of weight loss below 200 °C corresponded to the removal of interlayer water molecules. The second stage, occurring between 200 and 400 °C corresponded to the dehydroxylation of hydroxyl groups from the Brucite layers and decarboxylation of carbonate ions present in the interlayer region [30,35]. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) profiles of MAR–HT, MAN–HT, and MANR–HT materials are displayed in Fig. 3 . The TPR profile of MAN–HT exhibited a broad reduction peak at 450 °C corresponding to the reduction peak of Ni2+ present in the MAN–HT material, which is higher than the reduction temperature of pure Ni (378 °C) [30]. The increase in reduction temperature might be due to the extent of the interaction of Ni species with the HT framework. Similarly, MAR–HT also exhibited a reduction profile with a broad reduction peak at a higher reduction temperature (456 °C). The peak can be attributed to the reduction of RuO2 and indicates a strong interaction of Ru species with the HT framework. The MANR–HT exhibited a broad reduction peak with Tmax at 437 °C, which is much higher than that of pure NiRu–HT type materials (360 °C). A single reduction peak appeared at higher reduction temperature, indicating the uniform distribution of Ni/Ru species in the HT framework and formation of a solid solution [30–32,36,37]. The TPR profile of MANRh–HT and MANI–HT also exhibited single reduction peaks at 277 and 302 °C, respectively, thus supporting the uniform distribution of metallic species (Fig. S4.). The SEM image of MANR–HT is shown in Fig. S5, which shows the aggregation of irregular-shaped particles and is similar to the images of HT observed in literature [36]. Nitrogen sorption isotherms of the MANR–HT material are displayed in Fig. 4 . MANR–HT exhibits a type IV isotherm with H3 hysteresis corresponding to multilayer adsorption followed by capillary condensation in slit-shaped pores [30,33,34]. The BET surface area of MANR–HT was 32 m2/g with a 0.126 cm3/g BJH pore volume and 15.99 nm mean pore diameter. The data are in agreement with HT characteristics."
6,Catalytic performance of the catalysts,"Thoroughly characterized materials were utilized for the hydrogenation of CAL to HCOL, and the results are discussed in the following section. The possible products for the hydrogenation of CAL are COL, HCAL, and HCOL depending on the reaction conditions used (Scheme 1 ). The activity of the catalysts prepared using different mono and bimetallic species were studied with respect to the hydrogenation of CAL at 150 °C and 1 MPa H2 pressure for 10 h. The results are summarized in Table 1 . Parent MA–HT showed only 11% conversion of CAL with all three types of hydrogenated product. The introduction of Ni facilitated the increase in conversion of CAL to 49% with 76% selectivity to CAL. Ru containing HT also showed similar conversion of CAL. The bimetallic MANR–HT yielded complete conversion of CAL to HCOL with 97.5% selectivity. The other minor product was HCAL (2.5%). Ni/Rh and Ni/Ir containing HT materials also yielded 87% and 97% conversion of CAL, respectively, with HCAL and HCOL as the major products. The results suggests that Ni/Ru containing MANR–HT catalysts possess high catalytic efficiency and selectivity during CAL hydrogenation to HCOL. The observed high activity and selectivity of the catalyst in the present reaction might have been due to the synergetic effect of bimetallic Ni/Ru coupled with basic sites of the HT material. Temperature is an important factor in the hydrogenation reaction of CAL. To obtain the optimum temperature for CAL hydrogenation using MANR–HT catalyst, the reaction was conducted at different temperatures, and the results are shown in Fig. 5 . From the experimental results given in Fig. 5, it can be seen that the reaction did not yielded any hydrogenation products of CAL until the reaction temperature reached 120 ℃. At lower temperatures (120–130 °C), the catalyst yielded an approximately 70% conversion of CAL with HCAL as the major product and HCOL and COL as the minor products. The conversion of CAL and selectivity of HCOL increased with increase in reaction temperature. At 140 °C, complete conversion of CAL was obtained with 64% and 26% HCOL and HCAL selectivity, respectively. When the reaction temperature reached 150 °C, the conversion of CAL and selectivity of HCOL reached its maximum (100% conversion of CAL with 97.5% selectivity for HCOL). Therefore, it can be seen that temperature has a great influence on the conversion and selectivity of products in the hydrogenation reaction of CAL, and 150 °C was found to be the optimum reaction temperature. In addition to reaction temperature, the H2 pressure was also an important factor that influenced the conversion and selectivity during CAL hydrogenation. The conversion and selectivity of MANR–HT catalyst in CAL hydrogenation was investigated at different H2 pressures, and the results are shown in Fig. 6 . The conversion of CAL increased as the H2 pressure increased. At very low pressure (0.2 MPa), the catalyst yielded 25% conversion of CAL with 60% selectivity to HCAL and formation of COL and HCOL as the other minor products. The CAL conversion of 75% with 50% selectivity to HCOL and 81% with 50% selectivity to HCOL was obtained at 0.5 and 0.8 MPa H2 pressures, respectively. With an increase in H2 pressure to 1 MPa, the catalyst MANR–HT yielded complete conversion of CAL with 97.5% selectivity to HCOL. The CAL hydrogenation reaction was also carried out using MANR catalysts having different Mg/Al ratios under optimum temperature and pressure conditions; results are displayed in Fig. 7 . It can be observed from Fig. 7 that MANR 1-1 and MANR 2-1 catalysts show 25% and 55% conversion, respectively, of CAL with the formation of HCAL as the major product. Based on the experimental data, it can be concluded that as the Mg/Al ratio of MANR catalyst increases, Al content in the catalyst decreases, and basicity of the catalyst increases, which in turn favours the conversion of CAL and selectivity of HCOL. The MANR 3–1 catalyst with the lowest aluminium content and highest basicity facilitates complete conversion of CAL with highest selectivity to HCOL. The stability of the MANR–HT catalyst for CAL hydrogenation was investigated by conducting a recyclability study, and the results are depicted in Fig. 8 . After each cycle of reactions, the catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation and washed with solvent (isopropanol), dried, and used for the next reaction cycle. The catalyst showed similar CAL conversions in all four consecutive cycles. The selectivity of HCOL decreased in the third cycle, and a mixture of HCAL, HCOL, and COL were obtained."
7,Conclusion,"Nickel-ruthenium containing magnesium-aluminium hydrotalcite (MANR–HT) materials were prepared using the co-precipitation method, which showed excellent catalytic efficiency and selectivity in the complete functional group hydrogenation of CAL to yield saturated alcohol (HCAL). Under optimum reaction conditions, (150 °C, 1 MPa H2 pressure, 10 h) the MANRT–HT catalyst yielded 100% conversion of CAL with 97.5% selectivity for HCOL. The performance of the catalyst was maintained ever after four reaction cycles."
