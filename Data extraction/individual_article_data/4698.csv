0,Introduction,"Freezing and thawing attack is one of the serious threats to concrete structure especially in cold region. The repeated freeze–thaw cycles result in cracking and spalling of concrete, and thus lead to the failure of structure. Therefore, how to improve the freeze–thaw resistance ability is crucial for the sustainable development of civil engineering. Considering the role of water in the freezing-thawing process, this work explores a new approach to improve the freezing–thawing resistance ability of concrete by cellulose/polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel. The damage mechanism of concrete caused by frost action have been extensively studied. With the decrease of temperature, the water start to be iced in capillary pores and the free water was forced to be moved into coarser pores. The migration of water through capillary pores under low temperature results in internal pressure [1,2]. In the process of establishing new equilibrium between liquid water and ice crystals, crystallization might result in damage of concrete [3]. Especially when the concrete was water-saturated, tensile hoop stress due to ice crystals may be the main cause of frost damage at low temperature [4]. The frost damage increases with the ice nucleation temperature decreases [5]. Either osmotic pressure theory or ice crystallization pressure mechanism indicates that the water is the main cause of damage during freeze–thaw cycling. Various methods have been proposed to limit the penetration of external water into concrete, such as using hydrophobic agents [6], incorporating blended materials [7] or air entraining agent to modify the pore structure. In contrast, limited information can be found in detaining the inner water with concrete. Storing the water in components during freezing instead of transforming into ice has the potential to reduce the damage caused by frost action. From this aspect, a type of hydrogel polymer which is sensitive to the repeated freeze–thaw cycles can be used to restrict the activity of water under frost action. Hydrogel is a type of intelligent material with characteristics such as reversibility, water absorption, water retention [8], desired functionality [9], crosslinked structure [10], and etc. Hydrogels can respond to changes in the environment, such as temperature [11–13], pH value [12,14], ion types and concentration [15], electrical signals [16], and etc. Among them, the hydrogel prepared by cellulose/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) can be response to the cycling of freeze–thaw. The low-temperature PVA hydrogel is a physical cross-linked network structure, which belongs to the network at the aggregation state level, and has the characteristics of high strength and high elasticity [17–19]. The PVA aqueous solution can form a high-strength elastomer with a water content of more than 85% after low-temperature treatment [20]. Cellulose is one of the most abundant polymers in nature, which has no pollution to the environment [21]. Due to the distinct stress-relaxation, the cellulose nanofibrils-reinforced hydrogel is sensitive to temperature, and it will gelate at 26.4 ℃ [11]. It is shown that the cellulose/PVA hydrogel prepared in NaOH/urea aqueous solution through freeze–thaw cycles has great swelling properties and higher mechanical strength [18,22]. During the freezing process, the movement state of hydrogel molecular chain is gradually “frozen” [23], and the water can be trapped in the hydrogel. Therefore, the cellulose/PVA hydrogel can limit the activity of water at low temperatures, and play a role of buffer and connector inside concrete. Moreover, an obvious three-dimensional network structure can be observed in the nanocellulose/PVA composite hydrogel prepared by freeze–thaw cycling [24]. This pore features can be used to improve the crack resistance of concrete under freezing and thawing attack. Therefore, the cellulose/PVA hydrogel can be developed to improve the performance of cementitious materials under frost action and prolong the service life of concrete structure. Previous studies have shown that hydrogel can be used to improve the performance of concrete and has good compatibility with cementitious materials. The investigation of thermo-sensitive N-isopropylacrylamide hydrogel shows that the hydrogel can decrease the internal deflects and improve the cracking resistance ability of mortar [13]. The temperature-sensitive hydrogels were used to reduce the surface damage of mortar [25]. The ion-responsive superabsorbent hydrogel was developed for concrete self-healing, the prepared CaAlg hydrogel promotes self-healing in the sodium silicate system [26]. The non-aggregated calcium hydroxide nano-spherulites obtained via a suspension of Portland cement paste can be applied to enhance the mechanical property of polymeric hydrogels [27]. This work was designed to evaluate the feasibility of using hydrogel in improving the freeze–thaw resistance of cementitious materials. Cellulose and PVA were selected as raw materials for preparing a type of temperature response hydrogel. The compatibility between hydrogel and cementitious materials was evaluated via investigating the effects of cellulose fineness, cellulose/PVA ratio and freeze–thaw conditions on the performance of cement paste. The microstructure and modification mechanism of the hydrogel induced pastes was also determined via x-ray diffraction (XRD), calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravity analysis (TG), mercury intrusion porosimeter (MIP) and micro-CT (x-CT)."
1,Experiment,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The cement used in the experiment was P·II 52.5 Portland cement, with a specific surface area of 397 m2·kg−1. The chemical and mineral compositions which is calculated by bogue equation are shown in Table 1 . Two sizes of microcrystalline non-fibrous cellulose (20 and 90 μm) with hard rod-shaped, polyvinyl alcohol were used to prepare the raw solution. The alcoholics degrees and viscosity of polyvinyl alcohol is 88.0% and 20.5–24.5 mPa·s (obtained at 20℃ in 4% water solution), respectively."
3,Preparation of cellulose and PVA solution,"2.2 Preparation of cellulose and PVA solution In order to dissolve the cellulose, a mixed NaOH and urea solution was prepared by dissolving 6 g NaOH and 4 g urea in 90 g distilled water. Two kinds of cellulose solution with 4 wt% were prepared by dissolving the cellulose with various size (4 g for each) in the NaOH/urea mixed solution (96 g). The solution was then stirred at room temperature for 10 min. After dissolving, the cellulose solution was placed in a freezer at −30 ± 2 ℃ for 12 h and then thawed at 20 ± 2 ℃ for 2 h with magnetic stirring. Finally, two kinds of cellulose solutions with a mass fraction of 4% were obtained. The detailed preparation methods of cellulose and PVA solutions can be found in the reference elsewhere [22]. The PVA solution was prepared following the similar route. The PVA was firstly dissolved in a water bath at 90℃ for 1 h (PVA: 4 g, Water: 46 g). After being fully dissolved, 50 g of NaOH/urea solution (12 wt% NaOH and 8 wt% urea) was added in the PVA solution and mixed until reaching homogenization. The mixed solution was heated in a water bath for extra 10 min and cooled to room temperature naturally. A solution containing 6 wt% NaOH, 4 wt% urea and 4 wt% PVA was obtained."
4,Preparation of hydrogel,"2.3 Preparation of hydrogel The two types of cellulose solutions were mixed with the PVA solution at mass ratio of 3: 1, 1: 1, 1: 3, respectively. Hydrogels were formed via physical crosslinking method [22]. The whole preparation process can be summarized in Fig. 1 .The prepared original cellulose/PVA solution was frozen at −30 ± 2 ℃ for 12 h and thawed at room temperature (26 ± 2℃) for 2 h as one cycle. The solution was then repeated by freeze–thaw cycling for 7 times, and the hydrogel can be prepared."
5,The incorporation of hydrogel into cement paste,"2.4 The incorporation of hydrogel into cement paste In order to assess the effect of hydrogel solution on the performance of cement paste, cellulose/PVA solution prepared as mentioned above was mixed with fresh cement paste with a solution to cement mass ratio of 5% and 10%. A water to cement ratio (w/c) of 0.4 was used and the water introduced by cellulose/PVA solution was subtracted from the mixed water. The detailed mixture proportion can be found in Table 2 . The fresh paste was firstly mixed for 30 s, and then the cellulose/PVA solution was added and stirred for extra 90 s. The prepared paste was poured in the cubes of 20 mm × 20 mm × 20 mm to determine the microstructure and compressive strength. After being demolded, the blocks were cured following two different condition, one is exposed to freeze–thaw cycles immediately, and the other was cured in standard condition with temperature of 20 ± 2 ℃ and relative humidity of 95%. The samples were firstly frozen at −30 ± 2 ℃ for 12 h and thawed in a saturated solution of C a ( O H ) 2 at 20 ± 2 ℃ for 12 h, and every 24 h is a freeze–thaw cycle. The curing and cement paste preparation can be summarized as shown in Fig. 2 . For x-CT test, 10% of cellulose/PVA solution (cellulose: PVA = 1:1) was mixed with fresh cement paste and molded in a cylinder with diameter of 15 mm and height of 50 mm. Besides, we prepared cement paste without hydrogel as the control samples. One group was being cured exposed to the abovementioned freeze–thaw cycling for 21 days, and the other group was cured under standard condition for 21 days."
6,Characterizations,"2.5 Characterizations 2.5.1 Compressive strength After 20 times of freeze–thaw cycling, and the compressive strength tests were performed on the blocks at 21 days. The sample was thawed at room temperature once the last freezing has been completed. The applied loading speed was set as 2400 ± 200 N/s, and the final result is an average of six blocks. 2.5.2 Hydration heat releasing In order to investigate the early hydration process of cement paste mixed with cellulose/PVA solution, the heat releasing of mixed paste was monitored by using calorimetry analysis (TAMLAIR08, Swedish). The test was conducted at the fresh paste with a w/c of 0.5 and the dosage of cellulose/PVA solution was5% of cement by mass. After mixing cement, water and cellulose/PVA solution, the hydration process was tracked via the microcalorimeter. 2.5.3 XRD test The mineralogical compositions of hardened cement paste were analyzed by XRD with Cu Kα radiation source at 40 kV and 100 mA. XRD analysis were performed by scanning from 5 to 70 at 2θ, and the scan speed is 5°/min. 2.5.4 TG-DSC test After 20 cycles of freeze–thaw attack, the harden cement paste was terminated by using a freezing dryer at 2.0 Pa and −50 ℃ for 48 h. STA49C type integrated thermal analyzer was used in this work. The powders were placed in the alumina crucible, and the nitrogen was used as protective gas in the whole process. The heating rate was 10 ℃/min, and the testing starts from 30 ℃ until 1000 ℃. There are 3 endothermic peaks presented on the DSC curve: Endothermic peak caused by dehydration of adsorbed water and evaporation of free water around 105 ℃; Decomposing of CH at 420–470 ℃; Decomposing of C a C O 3 in the range of 690–750 ℃. Since there is no limestone filler or other calcium carbonates used in the paste, it is assumed the presence of C a C O 3 is caused by the carbonation of CH. The total hydrated C a ( O H ) 2 in the sample then can be calculated by Eq. (1). (1) A = 37 n / 9 + 37 m / 22 where A is the content of C a ( O H ) 2 (%); n is the mass loss of C a ( O H ) 2 (%); m is the mass loss of C a C O 3 (%). 2.5.5 Morphology of hydrogel The hydrogel sample was placed in distilled water until the hydrogel reaching swelling balance. In order to retain the morphology of hydrogel, the swollen hydrogel specimens were immersed in liquid nitrogen. Then, the hydrogel was dried by a freezing dryer for 48 h. The morphology of the truncated surface of hydrogel was observed under environmental scanning electron microscope. 2.5.6 Pore structure of hardened cement paste Autopore IV 9500 mercury intrusion meter was applied to determine effect of hydrogel on the pore structure of hardened cement paste. The applied pressure starts from 0.003 MPa until 227.567 MPa, and the measurable pore size is in the range between 3.0 nm and 400.0 μm according to the Washburn equation. The surface tension between mercury and the solid phase is 0.480 N/m, and the contact angle of 140° is used. The internal pore structure of hardened cement paste was reconstructed by the device of XTH255/320 LC (Nikon, Japan) equipped with a high-resolution detector (2000 × 2000 pixels). The applied beam current is 90 μA and accelerating voltage is 120 kV. The X-ray source passes through a Cu filter with a thickness of 0.25 mm and then through the sample. During the test, the sample rotates 360° with the sample stage, and the detector records the attenuation of the x-ray signal at different time and position. The 3D image can be obtained by VG Studio MAX 3.1 after the calculation of X-ray transmission projections at different angles."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Effect of hydrogel on early hydration of cement paste,"3.1 Effect of hydrogel on early hydration of cement paste 3.1.1 Heat release of hydration Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show the effect of different types of hydrogel on the heat flow rate and cumulative heat releasing of cement hydration during the first 24 h. It is found that the addition of cellulose/PVA solution has the potential to promote the early hydration of cement, especially when the m(cellulose):m(PVA) ratio is 1:1 and 1:3. The accumulated hydration heat of cellulose/PVA blended cement increases compared with the neat cement paste. Adding cellulose/PVA solution changed the release peak value, and the main peak presented at different time. The fineness of cellulose has little effect on the early hydration of cement, while the ratio of cellulose to PVA exerts a significant effect on the early hydration. The early hydration process of cement can be divided into four stages [28], as shown in Fig. 3 (a), Part I: initial dissolution, Part II: slow reaction induction, Part III: accelerating period, Part IV: decelerating reaction. When the ratio of cellulose to PVA is 1:1, the acceleration period was significantly shortened and the main hydration peak was put forward, and the cumulative heat is higher than other samples. It indicates that the incorporation of cellulose/PVA (cellulose: PVA = 1: 1) solution can effectively promote the early hydration of cement. The main hydration peak was dominated by the growth of hydrates C–S–H and Portlandite [29–31]. It can be inferred that the incorporation of cellulose/PVA solution provides more nucleation sites for the growth of hydration product C-S-H, which promotes hydration. 3.1.2 Phase composition In order to investigate the effect of cellulose/PVA solution on the phase composition of cement-based materials, XRD is used to test samples cured for 7 days at standard conditions. The mineralogical composition of hardened cement pastes mixed with different cellulose/PVA solutions was shown in Fig. 5 . The diffraction peak intensity of C3S, C2S and hydration product CH become weaker, which can be related to the ratio of cellulose/PVA. The polymer particles adsorbed on the surface of hydrating C3S grain and played the role of nucleating agent in the hydration [32]. The decrease of C3S and C2S indicates that hydrogel promotes the hydration of cement, which confirms the findings in heat release analysis. However, the presence of cellulose/hydrogel solution affected the crystal structure of hydration product CH, and the effect decreased with the increase of PVA content."
9,The performance of hardened cement paste after frost action,"3.2 The performance of hardened cement paste after frost action 3.2.1 Compressive strength After 20 cycles of freeze–thaw, the compressive strength of cellulose/PVA hydrogel blended cement paste is shown in Fig. 6 . The results showed that the compressive strength of cement paste with cellulose/PVA hydrogel was higher than the reference samples. Compared with the blank sample cured under standard condition for 21 days, the compressive strength of all samples after freeze–thaw cycle decreased, and the C/0 show the largest decreasing. The results indicate that the incorporation of cellulose/PVA solution can retain the compressive strength after freeze–thaw attack. The compressive strength of group C/A increase with PVA content. Due to the high toughness of PVA, the frost caused damage can be then modified. But there was no similar trend can be found in group C/B, of which the compressive strength decreased when the m(90 μm cellulose):m(PVA) decreased to 1:3. The skeleton of cellulose/PVA hydrogel network is highly dependent on cellulose, while the fine pores are formed by PVA. With the increase of PVA percentage, the pore size in hydrogel becomes smaller and the network structure tends to be compact. The fineness of cellulose affects the skeleton of hydrogel network structure. Due to the coarser cellulose particles used in group C/B, when the m(cellulose):m(PVA) decreased to 1:3, the skeleton formed by cellulose was loose, resulting in a poor three-dimensional structure. And the positive effect on frost resistance is reduced. Besides, the compressive strength of group C/A was generally higher than that of group C/B, indicating that 20 μm cellulose was more favorable for strength maintenance. There are two possible reasons for the observed improvement, one is the modified pore structure after frost action, and the other is releasing the expansion pressure caused by icing [33]. Moreover, the cellulose property appears as a key parameter on the microstructure development [34]. 3.2.2 Phase composition Fig. 7 shows that the effect of freeze–thaw cycle on the mineralogical composition of hydrated paste. The calcium hydroxide content is independent on the application of hydrogel solution after freeze–thaw cycling. When the specimens were exposed to freeze–thaw cycling, there is no change in the type of hydration products. The intensity of each signal peak is close and the addition of cellulose/PVA solution did not affect the hydration degree under freeze–thaw cycling. The TG and DSC analysis of the hardened pastes after 20 freeze–thaw cycles is shown in Fig. 8 . After 20 freeze–thaw cycles, the type of hydration product in each group is the same which confirms the findings in XRD analysis. As shown in Fig. 9 , the content of hydration product CH in each group is highly close with each other. The results indicate that the addition of cellulose/PVA solution has little effect on the hydration of cement. It can be concluded that after 20 freeze–thaw cycles, the difference in strength is not caused by cement hydration, but more likely due to the pore structure and the detaining of water which will be evaluated in the following discussion."
10,Morphology of hydrogel,"3.3 Morphology of hydrogel There is a strong hydrogen bond between the cellulose and PVA hydroxyl groups. The cross-linking forms a three-dimensional network-like hydrogel. The formation of hydrogels under freeze–thaw conditions is divided into four parts: phase separation, ice crystal formation, crosslinking and polymerization, and the ice crystals melt to form interconnected porous gels [23]. The hydrogel samples after freeze–thaw cycling are shown in Fig. 10 . The initial quantity and volume of hydrogels solution in each group was equal, but the volume of hydrogels formed after freeze–thaw cycling was different. It can be observed from Fig. 10 that the shape of hydrogel becomes more specific and the hardness of hydrogel increases with the increase of PVA content. The freeze-drying process can retain the internal structure of hydrogel, and the morphology of hydrogel after freeze-drying is shown in Fig. 11 . The network structure is composed of various sizes of pores, and the pore structure of hydrogels is refined as the percentage of PVA increases. The pore diameter decreases with the increase of PVA content. The coarse pores are the skeleton formed by cellulose, while the fine ones are the compact structures formed by PVA during the freeze–thaw cycle [22]. The low temperature accelerates the phase separation during the gelation of the PVA aqueous solution and promotes the interaction among the polymers [20]. During the freezing process, the movement state of PVA molecular chain is gradually “frozen”, and the chance of interaction between the molecular chains increased, leading to the formation of physical crosslinks by intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The chains of molecular were arranged in a certain micro area, making the binding among the molecular chains more strong. After temperature increases, the junctions can not be separated. In the next freezing process, new molecular chains are tightly bonded with the previous formed chains [35]. The network structure at the macroscopic level gives the hydrogel strength and elastic [36]. Hydrogels formed during freezing and molecular chains are maintained during thawing. The cellulose in the hydrogel system forms the skeleton, and PVA ensures the strength and the high elasticity. It is well known that the damage of cementitious materials by freeze–thaw attack mainly comes from the osmotic pressure. Regarding the cellulose/PVA solution blended cement paste, the hydrogel is formed inside the hardened cement paste after freeze–thaw cycling. On the one hand, the formed hydrogel is able to detain water, and store water inside its structure at low temperatures, which could reduce risk of icing and expansion. On the other hand, the generated hydrogel has elasticity and strength which can alleviate the damage of the hardened cement paste by the water pressure in the capillary pores. The temperature inside the mortar increases due to hydration, the hydrogel shrinks into a film, and the water in the gel is released, which could limit the cracks propagation due to dry shrinkage [13]. After being thawed, the hydrogel releases partial water into the hardened cement paste and promotes the hydration furtherly. At the same time, the formed hydrogel closes or blocks the connected pores in the hardened cement paste. Polymers are also used to promote the self-healing of concrete [37,38]. Besides, as a kind of gel, the hydrogel is similar with the CSH gel which can make the connection inside the hardened paste tighter."
11,Microstructure of hardened cement paste after freeze–thaw cycling,"3.4 Microstructure of hardened cement paste after freeze–thaw cycling The damage to concrete caused by freeze–thaw attack normally involve in two aspects: one is internal cracking, the other is surface shedding and damage. The crack damage caused by freeze–thaw cycle is mainly generated within concrete [39]. The bond ability of concrete decreased after freeze–thaw cycles under constant loading [40]. The interfacial transition zone has great influence on concrete performance [41,42]. Many studies have shown that the mechanism of freeze–thaw failure is highly determined by the microscopic pore structure inside concrete [43–46]. The initial freeze–thaw cycling causes the pore expansion and even the demolition of concrete [39]. In order to study the effect of freeze–thaw cycling on pore structure, the cement paste was cured under freeze–thaw conditions until 21 days. The pore size distribution obtained by MIP test is shown in Fig. 12 . After adding the cellulose/PVA solution into cement paste, the total porosity of hardened cement paste increases. From the results shown in Fig. 12(b), the porosity of the samples with diameters larger than 200 nm is basically similar with each other, and the incorporation of cellulose/PVA solution significantly increased the volume of pores finer than 50 nm. Studies have shown that the harmless pore diameter in concrete should be less than 20 nm, the less harmful pore diameter is 20–50 nm, and the harmful pore diameter is 50–200 nm [47]. The presence of pores with pore size ranging from 20 nm to 50 nm can improve the frost resistance of cement-based materials [47]. The addition of cellulose/PVA solution increased the content of pores less than 50 nm, which also explained the reason why the specimens made with hydrogel has a good ability of maintain the mechanical property after freezing and thawing attack. Fig. 13 illustrates the effect of porosity on compressive strength of hardened cement paste. The incorporation of the cellulose/PVA solution increase the porosity of the hardened cement paste increase. The porosity of hardened cement paste seems independent on the cellulose fineness. The same result was observed in group C/A and group C/B, and the porosity is inversely proportional to the compressive strength. In order to study the effect of hydrogel and freeze–thaw cycling on the pore structure of paste in more detail, this work conducted x-CT test on the hardened cement paste with 0% and 10% hydrogel (cellulose: PVA = 1:1). The three-dimensional structure of the hardened cement paste was reconstructed by processing and combining the layered scanning images. The images were divided by threshold, reconstructed and shown in Fig. 14 (the blue part of the figure represents the pore). In addition, X-CT can distinguish hardened cement paste and pore through threshold segmentation [48,49], so hydrogel may also be recognized as pores in the interior of hardened paste. After 20 freeze–thaw cycles, the pore quantity in hardened cement paste increases regardless the introducing of cellulose/PVA solution. It is worth noting that the number of large pores in reference specimens increases significantly. However, there is no significant increase of large pores for the specimens made with 10% of hydrogel. It can be concluded that the addition of hydrogel in cement paste could reduce the number of large pores caused by freeze–thaw cycling. The findings in MIP test is confirmed by x-CT evaluation that the incorporation of cellulose/PVA solution into cement-based materials increases the number of pores finer than 50 nm. The section of the cylindrical sample along the center is shown in Fig. 15 , section position is shown in Fig. 15. As shown in Fig. 15(a) and (b), after 20 freeze–thaw cycles, large pores and fine cracks can be observed in the hardened cement paste. Compared with the blank sample, the sample mixed with hydrogel had no cracks finer than 2 mm, while the cracks in blank sample are concentrated near center. The result indicates that the presence of cellulose/PVA hydrogels can prevent the crack propagation and reduce the freeze–thaw damage. In Fig. 15(d) and (e), although the pores are significantly increased, no obvious defects appear in the samples cured for 20 days in standard conditions. At low temperatures, the water-retaining effect of hydrogel reduces the free water content and eliminates the osmotic pressure. Combining the strength and elasticity of hydrogel, it is able to absorb and buffer the pressure generated by icing. During thawing, the hydrogel releases part of the water to support cement hydration, and the internal structure of the cement paste can be furtherly optimized by hydrogel."
12,Conclusion,"In the present work, an intelligent cellulose/PVA hydrogel was synthesized and applied in cementitious materials to reduce the frost caused damage. This could be a potential way of improving the service life of concrete structure in the cold region, especially when the concrete are exposed to freezing and thawing at very early age. Based on the findings mentioned above, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) The incorporation of cellulose/PVA hydrogel could retain the compressive strength of concrete under frost action effectively. (2) While the cellulose/PVA solution promotes the early hydration process of cement, the modification of the microstructure by hydrogel is the main reason for improving the freeze–thaw resistance. (3) Cellulose/PVA hydrogel has a three-dimensional network structure, water retention characteristics, a certain strength and elasticity. Under low temperature, it can reduce and buffer the osmotic pressure. After being thawed, it will optimize the internal structure of the cement paste. Under the freeze–thaw cycling, the presence of hydrogel prevented the propagation of cracks and reduced the production of macropores. (4) Cellulose/PVA hydrogel can be introduced into concrete as a solution to improve the freeze–thaw resistance of concrete, promoting the sustainable development of resources."
