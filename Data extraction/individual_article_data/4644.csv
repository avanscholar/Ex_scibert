0,Introduction,"Conformation of polymer chains, both adsorbed and unadsorbed in the bulk solution, determines the stability of the solid suspension [1,2]. Macromolecules attached with the solid particles can cause steric stabilization or bridging flocculation of the colloidal system. On the other hand the unadsorbed chains induce the depletion forces and the depletion stabilization or depletion flocculation may take place. The stabilization–flocculation properties of macromolecular substance depend on polymer type, its molecular weight and concentration. A very low polymer concentration causes the bridging flocculation of the suspension. At higher polymer concentration the steric stabilization is observed. Further concentration increase induces the depletion flocculation and at the highest polymer concentration the depletion stabilization occurs [3]. On the other hand, the lower polymer molecular weights favour stabilization effects, whereas in the presence of polymer with higher molecular weights, the flocculation process becomes dominant. Additionally, in the case of polyelectrolytes, which chains contain dissociable functional groups, the electrostatic forces appear. Thus, the mechanism of stabilization is combined and is termed electrosteric stabilization. Due to the fact that polymers show the great variety of stabilization mechanisms, they find a great practical application in many fields of human activity, e.g. industry, environment protection and agriculture. The stabilization processes are widely used in food processing, production of cosmetics, paints, coatings and pharmaceuticals, whereas the flocculation ones in water purification, separation of hazardous solids from chemical waste, flotation, oil recovery and mineral technology (purification of ceramic powders). The stabilization or destabilization effect may be achieved by proper choice of temperature range, thus the temperature conditions are very important for colloidal system stability in the presence of polymer. Nevertheless, the temperature effect on adsorption behaviour of polymer is scarcely and not extensively discussed in the world literature [4–6]. Many industrial processes take place at different temperatures and for this reason the better examining and explaining of macromolecule conformation on the dispersed solid surface as a function of temperature is very important for such applications. Taking the above into consideration, the purpose of present paper was determination of the temperature influence on electrical properties of silica (SiO2) surface in the presence of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The analysis of the solid surface charge without and with polymer gives some information of its conformation on the metal oxide surface. Despite the fact, that PVA is classified as a nonionic polymer, its macromolecules contain some acetate groups. These groups undergo dissociation, contrary to hydroxyl ones and influences the solid surface charge density with adsorbed polymer. Moreover, the temperature increase favours more stretched conformation of adsorbed polymer chains, which changes the structure of adsorption layer and influences stability of the system."
1,Materials and methods,"The samples of silica — SiO2 (Merck) were used in the studies. The solid was washed with doubly distilled water to achieve the supernatant conductivity of less than 2µS/cm. Silica was characterized by the BET surface area equal to 326m2/g. This parameter was determined from the low-temperature nitrogen adsorption–desorption method using the automatic adsorption analyzer ASAP 2405 (Accelerated Surface Area and Porosimetry) produced by Micromeritics Instruments. The samples of polyvinyl alcohol — PVA (Fluka) with the weight average molecular weights 22000 and 38000 were used in the study. The degree of hydrolysis of PVA was 97.5%. Polymer solutions were filtered through the cellulose membranes (Millipore) to eliminate both inorganic contamination and lower and higher polymer fractions. Due to the fact, that the degree of hydrolysis of PVA equals 97.5%, its chains contain 2.5% acetate groups –CH3COOH. These groups do not undergo hydrolysis in the production process of polyvinyl alcohol from polyvinyl acetate. It means that, besides -OH groups, the unhydrolysed acetate groups –CH3COOH are present in the PVA chains. The acetate groups undergo dissociation with the increasing pH and in this way PVA macromolecules gain negative charge. All measurements were carried out in the temperature range 15–35°C in the 3–10pH range and the NaCl solution (1×10−2 mol/dm3) was used as the supporting electrolyte. The surface charge density of silica in the absence and presence of polymer was determined from the potentiometric titrations. For this purpose, 50ml of polymer solution in supporting electrolyte (or only the supporting electrolyte solution) was put into the Teflon vessel. The added volumes of polymer and electrolyte solutions led to their final concentrations (C PAA =100ppm and C NaCl =1×10−2 mol/dm3). Initial pH of the solution (3–3.5) was adjusted by the use of HCl (1×10−1 mol/dm3). 0.1g of the solid was added into the prepared solutions. The burette Dosimat 665 (Methrom), thermostat RE204 (Lauda), a pH-meter 71 pHmeter (Beckman) connected with the computer and the printer were applied for the potentiometric titrations. The special program Miar_t whose author is W. Janusz was used to calculate the solid surface charge density."
2,Results,"The analysis of potentiometric titration curves (Figs. 1–3 ) indicates that at 15 and 25°C the solid surface charge in the absence of PVA is negative in the whole range of studied pH. This charge is positive in the pH range 3.3–3.7 only at 35°C (Fig. 3) and the determination of pHpzc point becomes possible. In this case the pHpzc value equals 3.5, which is in good agreement with the literature data [7]. Moreover, adsorption of polyvinyl alcohol causes insignificant increase of the silica surface charge density. This increase is more visible for higher molecular weight of polymer and higher temperature."
3,Discussion,"To explain the obtained dependencies, the analysis of degree of macromolecule ionization and solid surface charge density as a function of solution pH should be done. Despite the fact that polyvinyl alcohol is classified as a nonionic polymer, its macromolecules contain unhydrolysed acetate groups (–CH3COOH) and thus PVA adsorption behaviour depends strongly on the solution pH. Both PVA 22000 and PVA 38000 contain 2.5% acetate groups, which undergo dissociation with the increasing solution pH. Thus the negative charge originating from these groups increases with the pH rise. On the other hand, the silica surface charge is negative practically in the whole range of studied pH and its absolute value increases when solution pH is more basic. It means that pH increase induces stronger electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged surface and dissociated acetate groups in PVA macromolecules. Despite this fact, the adsorption of polyvinyl alcohol on the silica surface takes place, which is testified by obtained changes of the solid surface density in the presence of polymer. Thus, different non-electrostatic forces have to be responsible for PVA adsorption process on the SiO2 surface. Otherwise, the adsorption of negatively charged polymer chains on the negatively charged solid surface should not occur. Therefore, the polymer adsorption on the silica surface undergoes through the hydrogen bridges interactions. The hydrogen bonds can be created between silanol groups (both neutral (–SiOH) and charged (–SiO−, –SiOH2 +)) and polymer functional groups (–OH, –CH3COOH and –CH3COO−). The insignificant increase of the solid surface charge in the presence of polyvinyl alcohol is caused by the fact that PVA macromolecules are negatively charged. Thus, their adsorption can be treated as polyanion adsorption, which is accompanied by the creation on the adsorbent surface a greater number of positively charged surface groups. Moreover, at all investigated temperatures the greater increase of silica surface charge in the presence of higher molecular weight of PVA was obtained. It is caused by the fact that in the case of longer polymer chain, the negative charge originating from dissociated acetate groups is greater in comparison to the lower molecular weight of PVA. Thus, adsorption of PVA 38000 is connected with formation of a larger number of positively charged SiO2 surface groups and more distinct increase of the solid surface charge is observed. The temperature rise causes increase of the silica surface charge in the presence of polyvinyl alcohol. This effect is clearly visible at 35°C (Fig. 3). Such behaviour results from changes in conformation of adsorbing macromolecules. At low investigated temperature (15°C) conformation of adsorbed PVA chains is more coiled. Such structure of adsorption layer hinders access of negatively charged polymer groups to the solid surface active sites. Part of them was “closed” inside polymer coil and their adsorption on the adsorbent surface is impossible. For this reason, the great number of dissociated acetate groups does not undergo adsorption and insignificant increase of the solid surface charge was obtained. The temperature rise (35°C) causes improvement of solvent quality, which results in polymer coil developing and macromolecule conformation becomes more stretched (tails and loops structures are dominant). As a consequence, adsorbing acetate groups have a better access to the solid active sites. It ensures the possibility of adsorption of a greater number of acetate groups and the effect of surface charge density increase is more pronounced."
4,Conclusions,"The temperature changes in the range 15–35°C have a noticeable influence of the silica surface charge without and with adsorbed polyvinyl alcohol. At 15 and 25°C the surface charge of SiO2 in the absence of PVA is negative in the whole range of studied pH, whereas at 35°C only in the pH range 3.3–3.7 it is positive. The polymer adsorption causes increase of the solid surface charge density at all investigated temperatures and this increase is greater for higher PVA molecular weight. The temperature increase favours more stretched conformation of adsorbed polymer chains and a greater number of their acetate groups can be adsorbed on the silica surface through the hydrogen bridges. Thus, at highest investigated temperature (35°C) the most pronounced increase of the solid surface charge was obtained."
