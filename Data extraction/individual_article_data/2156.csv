0,Introduction,"Energy production from hydrogen gas has become one of the most discussed topics. The polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell is one of the major green energy technologies discussed today [1]. The fuel cells are classified based on the type of membrane utilized. It is this membrane that determines the fuel type used and the operating temperature of the fuel cell. To make the fuel cell successful in a commercial application the performance and the cost must meet the required targets. The improvement in the performance of the fuel cell majorly depends on its thermal and water management [2]. For water management various works have been reported with the adoption of flow channel modifications [3], optimizing operating parameters of the cell [4], purging techniques [5], and various coating techniques on bipolar plates and gas diffusion layers. For the PEMFC the operating temperature of the fuel cell must be maintained between 50 to 80 °C [6]. Thermal management of the fuel cell is essential as at elevated temperature material degradation and dehydration of the membrane occurs which will eventually result in large ionic resistance and ohmic losses. At lower operating temperature the kinetics of the electrochemical reaction is low and it also leads to water flooding in the Gas diffusion layer (GDL) and flow channel [6,7]. Due to this a great concern has been shown in improving the thermal management of the fuel cell. The various techniques applied for thermal management of fuel cells can be broadly classified into passive and active cooling techniques. The thermal management with heat spreaders, heat pipes, and PCM can be classified into passive cooling techniques. In active cooling techniques cooing with fans and liquid cooling are employed. A fuel cell produces a thermal energy equivalent to its electrical energy, so a fuel cell with a 100 W electrical power output generates equivalent thermal energy of 100 W [8–10]. So based on the electrical power of the fuel cell, suitable active or passive cooling techniques are employed each type having its own merits and demerits [11]. The liquid cooling technique is normally employed for a fuel cell stack greater than 10 kW. Various fluids such as water, ethylene glycol, and oil are used as coolants in liquid cooling techniques. To improve the performance of these coolants various works have been carried out with the mixture of water and ethylene glycol and various Nanofluids [12]. Zakaria et al experimentally investigated the effects of the Nanofluid prepared from Al2O3 in a mixture of water, ethylene glycol and found to improve the thermal management of fuel cell [13,14]. Islam et al improved the thermal and electrical conductivity of the TiO2 based Nanofluid in a mixture of water – ethylene glycol [15]. An experimental investigation on 2.4 kW PEMFC with the nanofluid based on ZnO shows better performance compared to Al2O3 and TiO2 [16]. Apart from these various nanofluids, the effects of the flow channels on the cooling plate were also studied. The numerical investigation by Rahgoshay et al showed that the cooling plate with serpentine flow channel showed improvement in thermal management compared to the parallel flow channel design [17]. Zakaria et al in their experimental work have reported the use of SiO2 based nanofluids as an alternative to the distilled water for PEM thermal management [18]. The major drawbacks of the liquid cooling method include coolant degradation, radiator size, and large parasitic power involved, so they are suitable for large-scale applications. For the small-scale applications of fuel cells, the use of passive cooling techniques reduces the complexity, cost, and weight of the system when compared with active cooling techniques. Moreover, these passive cooling methods help us to avoid the usage of pumps for the cooling system thereby reducing the parasitic power losses. In the passive cooling techniques, the heat spreaders sheets and heat pipes have been widely investigated. The material used as heat spreaders and heat pipes should have high thermal conductivity, low cost, and low density. The materials used for heat spreaders are usually made from copper, aluminum, and carbon materials [19]. The Pyrolytic graphite sheets (PGS) as heat spreaders for the passive thermal management of fuel cells were tested by Wen et al [20]. The PGS was further successfully employed in the PEM fuel cell stack and found to have an improvement in the performance of the cell [21]. Another major passive thermal management system employed in a fuel cell is heat pipes. The heat pipes come with different modifications in design to remove the thermal energy depending on the application. When compared with the heat spreaders the heat pipes can act as both active and passive thermal management systems without major modifications. Clement et al. utilized pulsating heat pipes for the thermal management of fuel cells and found that methanol as a fluid performed better compared to acetone and water [22]. The flat heat pipes were integrated with the bipolar plates to remove heat corresponding to 1.8 W/cm2 [23]. The major cons of heat spreaders and heat pipes are the non-availability of cost-effective material with very high thermal conductivity. Fluckiger et. al investigated the edge air-cooled fuel cell with a separator plate and found that a trade-off must be made between maximum specific power and minimum specific cost as an increase in the active area did not favor the cost involved [24]. The numerical investigation indicates that the fan power rating, fan type, position of multiple fans, and channel length impact the performance of the fuel cell stack [25]. Heras et al have proposed and built an optimized Oxidant/Cooling subsystem to improve the performance and reduce the cost of fuel cell stack [26]. Lee et al investigated an innovative flow field design on the cathode side for the passive air-cooled fuel cell, which improves the performance of the stack and retains the water content even in excessively dry air conditions [27]. Wen et. al. utilized a combination of passive cooling technique (Pyrolytic graphite sheets) and active cooling technique (small fans) for the thermal management of fuel cell stack and this technique has improved the thermal management of the stack by improving its performance [28]. The Phase Change Materials (PCM) is another passive thermal management system widely explored and utilized in various applications. When compared with other thermal management systems the cost of PCM is low, PCM can store the waste heat generated and it can later utilize this waste heat for preheating the fuel cell during cold start-up conditions. In this regard based on the application requirements, a suitable PCM is chosen and studied. The battery is an electrochemical device like a fuel cell, where the possibility of employing PCM for its thermal management is widely studied [29]. For the thermal management of batteries various combinations like PCM with fin structure [30,31], composites of carbon fiber and PCM [32], PCM with forced air cooling [33], and encapsulated PCMs [34] have been widely investigated. Huang et al have experimentally studied the application of paraffin and paraffin with expanded graphene for the thermal management of Lithium-ion batteries [35]. Kong et al proposed and found improvement by combining PCM with liquid cooling thermal management system for the continuous operation of Lithium-ion battery [36]. For the application of PCM in Fuel cell a suitable PCM with an appropriate melting point and Latent heat must be selected. In this regard, there have been extensive works performed with various PCMs available [37–40]. From the various works of literature, Stearyl Alcohol has a suitable melting point and high latent heat to be utilized in the thermal management of fuel cell [41–45]. The development of passive thermal management for the fuel cell is necessary to reduce or eliminate the parasitic power utilized by the cooling system. In this regard, the ability of PCM as passive thermal management for the fuel cell has not yet been explored. In this paper, we try to investigate the potential of utilizing PCM as passive thermal management in a PEM fuel cell. The effects of combining PCM along with the air cooling system for the thermal management of fuel cell are also studied. The thermal energy generated from the fuel cell is replicated by the heater plate. The FCTMS is studied under four modes of operations, the applied power is varied from 0.1 to 0.45 W/cm2 and their corresponding temperatures are recorded by the thermocouples placed in the cooling plate."
1,Experimental study,
2,Fuel cell thermal management system (FCTMS),"2.1 Fuel cell thermal management system (FCTMS) The FCTMS consists of a heater plate, cooling plate, PCM, support plate, and endplates. The dimensions of these elements are described in Table 1 . The heater plate is used to replicate the thermal energy generated from the fuel cell. The endplate, cooling plate with the cavity (as shown in Fig. 2), and the support plate are made of aluminum. The PCM must be selected properly to suit the FCTMS. The FCTMS was operated in 4 different modes of cooling operation as shown in Table 2 . In modes 2 and 4 the cavity inside the cooling plate is filled with 44 gm of PCM in its liquid state and later cooled to its solid state. A total of 5 holes of 2 mm diameter were drilled at the back of cooling plates, shown in Fig. 1 , for the provision of thermocouples. The cooling plate is placed on the top of the heater plate and the support plate is placed above the cavity of the cooling plate. A silicone gasket is placed between the cooling plate and the support plate to seal the PCM inside the cavity during melting. The heater, cooling, and support plates are placed between the endplates and fastened tightly."
3,PCM selection,"2.2 PCM selection Stearyl alcohol (1-Octadecanol) (CH3(CH2)16CH2OH) was purchased from LOBA CHEMIE PVT. LTD. Its basic physical and chemical properties as provided by the supplier are given in Table 3 . This study aimed to maintain the temperature of the Fuel cell within 60°C. The stearyl alcohol has a melting point in the range of 55-58°C, which is slightly less than the required temperature. Also, it has stable thermal properties, nontoxic, and low cost suitable for practical applications."
4,Characterization of PCM,"2.3 Characterization of PCM The following characterizations were done with the Stearyl alcohol to study its thermal conductivity, its phase change temperature during heating and cooling curves and to study its heat of enthalpy. The thermal conductivity was done with a C-ThermTrident Thermal conductivity Analyser. The phase change temperature during the heating and cooling curve and the heat of enthalpy was done with the instrument Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC)."
5,Experimental setup,"2.4 Experimental setup The block diagram of the experimental setup for examining the thermal management of FCTMS is shown in Fig. 2 . A flat customized electrical heater to simulate the heat generated from the PEM fuel cell is used FCTMS. The dimensions of the customized heater were chosen based on the active area of the Fuel cell that generates similar thermal energy. The power supplied to the heater was controlled by a DC power supply through the applied voltage. The heater plate is placed at the back of the cooling plate, which removes the heat generated from the heater. The temperature of the cooling plate is measured by five thermocouples placed at various locations as shown in Fig. 1. The temperature from the thermocouples is recorded by a data logger (KEYSIGHT 34912A LXI Data Acquisition) and these data are stored in a PC connected to the data logger. A DC cooling fan used for cooling is controlled through a DC power supply."
6,Experimental procedure,"2.5 Experimental procedure This study aims to maintain the temperature of the fuel cell within 60°C with the aid of the PCM and cooling fan. The experiment is conducted in four modes of operation as shown in Table 2. In all four modes of operation, constant power is supplied to the heater which in turn heats the cooling plate. The temperature in the cooling plate is measured by the thermocouples and recorded to the PC until the temperature reaches a steady-state value or for the duration of 3 hours if the temperature reaches 60°C. For the repeatability of the study, all the experiments were conducted twice and their corresponding readings were recorded. The heater was subjected to a constant power density altered from the range of 0.1 W/cm2 to 0.45 W/cm2."
7,Results and discussion,
8,DSC,"3.1 DSC Fig. 3 shows the melting (endothermic) and solidifying (exothermic) curves for the Stearyl alcohol obtained from the DSC. These curves are very much essential as it provides the phase change enthalpy and transition temperature of the Stearyl alcohol used in this study. From the heating curve of the Stearyl alcohol, we can observe that the endothermic transition occurs in a single peak. The onset of the endothermic peak starts at 57°C, offset at 62.5°C, the maximum peak of the curve occurs at 59°C, and the enthalpy of melting of the Stearyl alcohol was found to be 260 J/g. The cooling curve of the Stearyl alcohol exhibited two peaks during the exothermic transition phase. The combined enthalpy of both the curves during cooling was observed to be -253.7 J/g. The onset of the first curve during the exothermic transition occurs at 54°C and its offset is noticed at 52°C. The onset of the second curve is observed at the temperature of 47°C and its offset occurs at 45°C."
9,Thermal management of FCTMS,"3.2 Thermal management of FCTMS 3.2.1 Temperature distribution on the cooling plate The temperature distribution on the various locations of the cooling plate recorded by the thermocouple during mode 1 operation at 0.25 W/cm2 is shown in Fig. 4 . The difference in the temperature observed at various locations is not much (0.5°C). However, compared to other thermocouples, the thermocouple placed at the center of the plate recorded higher temperatures. Since the temperature difference between thermocouples is minimum, the temperature of the cooling plate is taken as the average of the readings recorded by the 5 thermocouples. 3.2.2 FCTMS Mode 1 Fig. 5 shows the temperature recorded on the cooling plate at various power densities during mode 1. For the power density of 0.25 W/cm2 and lower the FCTMS was able to hold the temperature below 60°C. It was only after increasing the power density to above 0.30 W/cm2 that the temperature of the cooling plate crossed 60°C. It is also observed from the graph that the cooling plate at the power density of 0.30 W/cm2 crossed the temperature of 60°C after 71 minutes and for the power density of 0.35 W/cm2 after 42 minutes. Thus, it can be deduced that the FCTMS requires a cooling technique when operated at the power density in the range higher than 0.25 W/cm2 in order to control the temperature within 60°C. 3.2.3 FCTMS in mode 2 The temperature of the cooling plate in mode 2 under various applied power densities is shown in Fig. 6 . The FCTMS in mode 2 shows better thermal management compared with FCTMS in mode 1. The FCTMS with PCM was able to contain the temperature of the cooling plate within 60°C efficiently till the applied power density of 0.30 W/cm2. However, when the applied power density was increased further the PCM was unable to hold the temperature of the cooling plate below 60°C. For the power density of the heater 0.32 W/cm2 the temperature of the cooling plate reached a steady state at 61.5°C and it crossed 60°C only after 132 minutes. When the heater power was increased further to 0.35 W/cm2 the FTCMS was able to hold the temperature below 60°C for 72 minutes and it reached a peak value of 65.6°C at the end of the 3 hours. When compared with mode 1, the maximum power density that can be applied with mode 2 was 0.05 W/cm2 (20%) higher. From the DSC curve, it can be observed that the onset of the heating curve is around 57°C. The PCM inside the FCTMS starts to change its phase from the solid to liquid around 57°C. During this phase transition, it will store heat from the cooling plate till all the PCM has changed its phase from solid to liquid state. The amount of heat removed can be increased by increasing the quantity of PCM used. Thus we can understand that the FCTMS with PCM can control the temperature as long as all the PCM inside converts from solid to liquid state. From the previous discussions it is clear that for the given quantity of PCM utilized, the time required for the cooling plate to reach the temperature of 60°C reduces as we increase the applied power density. If we increase the quantity of PCM utilized it can absorb more heat and results in an extension of the duration for the cooling plate to reach 60°C. Thus, by increasing the quantity of the PCM, we can control the temperature below 60°C for the duration of 3 hours for the power density higher than 0.30 W/cm2. So it can be concluded that the FCTMS with PCM can control the temperature within the 60°C for the power density in the range higher than 0.30 W/cm2 if the quantity of the PCM used can be increased further. 3.2.4 Mode 1 vs. Mode 2 The FCTMS in mode 2 shows better thermal management when compared with mode 1. From Fig. 7 it can be noticed that the thermal management with mode 1 and mode 2 is relatively similar till the power density of 0.25 W/cm2. At the power density of 0.30 W/cm2, the FCTMS under mode 1 crosses the temperature of 60°C after 71 minutes whereas under mode 2 FCTMS was able to hold the temperature below 60°C. When we consider the power density of 0.35 W/cm2, under mode 1 FCTMS crosses the 60°C after 42 minutes whereas it took 72 minutes (72% more time) under mode 2 to cross this temperature. Further from Fig. 6 under mode 2 for the power density of 0.35 W/cm2, it can be observed that after 55 minutes of operation there is a slight rise in the curve till the duration of 125 minutes and after 125 minutes of operation, the curve starts to rise again. This distinct middle region of the curve occurs due to the melting of the PCM from its solid state to the liquid state. This rise in curve after 125 minutes indicates that all the PCM has changed its phase from solid to liquid state. Thus for the quantity of PCM utilized the FCTMS under mode 2 was able to hold the temperature till 0.30 W/cm2 and even after that the cooling plate with mode 2 shows lower temperature compared to mode 1. 3.2.5 FCTMS under mode 4 The temperature of the FCTMS in mode 4 under various applied heater power is shown in Fig. 8 . It can be observed from the graph that in mode 4 the FCTMS was able to control the temperature below 60°C till the heater power density of 0.40 W/cm2. Even at 0.45 W/cm2, it was able to hold the temperature of the cooling plate below 60°C for about 91 minutes. At the power density of 0.45 W/cm2, we can observe that the curve starts to increase around the time 90 minutes and it continues to rise till the time duration of 125 minutes. It is during this period the phase change of Stearyl alcohol from solid to liquid is happening inside the FCTMS. The thermal management at this power density could be improved by increasing the quantity of the Stearyl alcohol inside the FCTMS. 3.2.6 FCTMS comparison of all Modes Fig. 9 shows the steady-state temperature of the cooling plate attained in various modes of operation. It can be understood that FCTMS under mode 4 shows better performance when compared with the other three modes of operation. The FCTMS in mode 4 shows better thermal management than FCTMS with the only fan. This indicates the addition of PCM has improved the thermal management of the cooling fan. In mode 3 the FCTMS can limit the temperature within 60°C till the power density of 0.35 W/cm2. The FCTMS in mode 4 was able to hold the temperature till 0.40 W/cm2, which is 14% higher than mode 3. Further at 0.45 W/cm2, FCTMS in mode 3 reached the limiting temperature in 31 minutes and in mode 4 it took 91 minutes, which is about 200% slower than mode 3. In this work, PCM was utilized as a passive thermal management system for a fuel cell of portable power generation and small-scale applications. So the performance of PCM and PCM combined with the fan is compared with that of the reported passive thermal management system. Wen et al. in their work utilized Pyrolitic graphite sheets (PGS) as a passive thermal management system and showed improvement in the performance of the cell. Table 4 shows the comparison of the power density applied in this work with other reported works."
10,Conclusion,"The FCTMS is studied at various power densities under the operation of modes 1 to 4. The following conclusions can be drawn from the results observed. 1. The FCTMS under mode 1 crossed the temperature of 60°C when loaded at the power density of 0.30 W/cm2. Till the power density of 0.25 W/cm2, the FCTMS did not cross the temperature of 60°C, thus a cooling system below this power density might not be required. 2. The FCTMS under mode 2 shows better performances compared to mode 1 at all the power densities. It can hold the temperature of FCTMS under 60°C till the power density of 0.30 W/cm2, which is 20% higher than mode 1. At 0.35 W/cm2 mode 2 can delay the time to cross 60°C by 72% compared to mode 1. 3. FCTMS with mode 4 shows the best performance when compared with all the other three modes. Under mode 4 the FCTMS can hold the temperature to the power density of 0.4 W/cm2, which is 14% higher than mode 3. At 0.45 W/cm2 mode, 4 can delay the time to cross 60°C by 200% compared to mode 3. 4. The Stearyl alcohol as passive thermal management of FCTMS shows good promise till the power density of 0.30 W/cm2 and the combination of PCM with cooling fan further improves the efficiency of the thermal management with the cooling fan."
