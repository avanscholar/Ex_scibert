0,Introduction,"Carboxymethyl Cellulose Sodium (CMC) is an anionic polymer compound and is commonly used in the paper-making and textile industries [1,2]. It plays a major role in improving adhesion and moisturizing. However, it is accompanied by a large amount of salt and alkali in wastewater [3,4]. Membrane separation technology, such as electrodialysis (ED) [5,6], and diffusive dialysis (DD) [7–9], is used as an environmentally friendly treatment process without secondary pollution and applied to the removal of macromolecules or the recovery of salt and alkali. Although the above methods are applicable, they are accompanied by a large amount of energy consumption and high processing costs. Moreover, for the recovery of alkali and salt, the stability of the membrane material in the lye will become a key factor restricting the recovery of alkali [10]. Therefore, it is great significance to developing an anti-fouling ultrafiltration membrane with low energy consumption, high flux, and stability in a strongly alkaline environment. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a water-soluble, biocompatible, and biodegradable synthetic polymer [11,12]. PVA has good hydrophilicity and extremely easy swelling characteristics [13,14], due to a large number of hydroxyl groups in its molecular chain, and these hydroxyl groups also become the reaction sites for PVA to form hydrogen bonds and cross-linked structures with other molecules [15,16]. However, when the concentration of PVA aqueous solution exceeds 10%, it is easy to gel at room temperature, which is not conducive to the preparation of the PVA membrane. Therefore, the preparation of the PVA membrane is generally made by solvent evaporation with low concentration PVA solution, or by blending PVA with polysilicon copolymers through the sol-gel method. PVA has been widely involved in the preparation of pervaporation (PV) [17,18] membranes. Wang et al. [19] used solvent evaporation to prepare a PVA PV membrane containing Schiff base network (SNW-1) nanoparticles. The study found that the separation factor is 1501, and the permeation flux reaches 187 g/m−2h of the membrane with 10 wt% loadings of SNW-1 at 75 °C. Sakarkar et al. [20] used solvent evaporation to prepare a PVA/TiO2 solution coated PVDF membrane for dye removal. The experimental results showed that as the PVA content increases, the hydrophilicity and antifouling performance of the membrane is better, and the dye removal rate is also increased. Hao et al. [7] prepared cationic exchange membranes using PVA and polysilicon as copolymers by the sol-gel method. The diffusion dialysis (DD) process for the alkali mixture indicates that the dialysis coefficients of NaOH (UOH) are around 0.0065–0.0086 m/h and the separation factors (S) are in the range of 24.4–51.6 for the NaOH/Na2WO4 system. Wu et al. [21] prepared a quaternized poly(2, 6-Dimethyl-1,4-phenylene Oxide) (QPPO) and PVA anion exchange membranes by sol-gel method. The diffusion dialysis (DD) process for the acid mixture suggests that the dialysis coefficient of HCl (UH) increases from 0.021 m/h to 0.049 m/h, but the separation factor (S) decreases from 39 to 26 for the HCl/FeCl2 system. The pervaporation (PV) membrane generally adopts the PVA surface coating method to form a dense selective layer on the surface of the support to increase the efficiency [22], or use PVA to blend with other fillers to prepare PV membranes by the thermally induced phase inversion (TIPS) method [23]. It is worth noting that the use of these PVA membrane is mainly DD membrane, and PV membrane. UF membranes with PVA as the subject material have a high swelling degree and difficult pore size control. There were few reports about the PVA UF membrane. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) has good chemical resistance, heat resistance, chemical inertness, and hydrophobicity [24–26]. Due to its excellent performance and good dispersion characteristics, PTFE emulsion is widely used in nanofiber membranes [27,28] and microporous membranes [29]. Zhang et al. [30] used PTFE as the support membrane, PTFE emulsion and carbon black (CB) were coated on the surface of the support membrane to prepare a PTFE/CB microporous membrane. The prepared PTFE/CB microporous membrane has high tensile strength and high hydrophobicity. Yu et al. [31] electrospun the PTFE/PVA spinning solution into a precursor nanofiber membrane, to introduce a dispersion of PTFE-hexafluoropropylene (FEP) by electrostatic spraying. The original fiber mesh structure of electrospinning is optimized for membrane emulsification. Generally speaking, PTFE has no pore-forming effect. We innovatively use the hydrophobicity of PTFE and the hydrophilicity of PVA, and use the difference in compatibility between the two phases to achieve the pore-forming effect of the UF membrane. In this study, we proposed a novel method for preparing PVA/PTFE UF membranes, which has not been reported in the previous literature. This work shows for the first time the use of PTFE emulsion as a porogen followed by cross-linking treatment to further improve membrane performance. So it's still green, reducing the use of a lot of organic solvents, water being used as the solvent. The preparation process is simple, cheap, and is suitable for large-scale production of low-cost UF membranes for the treatment of high-salinity cellulose wastewater. The gel properties of PVA solution were overcome by controlling the temperature of the aqueous solution of PVA/PTFE. The PVA/PTFE membrane was prepared by NIPS and cross-linking. It is worth noting that the newly developed PVA/PTFE membrane is in situ chemically cross-linked, simplifying the process procedure. At the same time, it can be heat-treated to further improve various properties of the membrane, providing new ideas for the synergistic modification of PVA membrane. In the separation process of CMC and saline-alkali, it has good CMC retention and saline-alkali separation rate, which provides a new strategy for the desalination and de-alkalization of solutions containing cellulose and its derivatives."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA-1799), polytetrafluoethylene concentrated dispersion (60 wt%), carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMC 300–800 mPa·S, USP) and Acridine Orange hemi (zinc chloride) salt (AO) were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Company. Polyethylene glycol (PEG, Mw = 1000) was provided by Tianjin Comair Chemical Reagent Co., LTD. Hydrochloric acid (HCl), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium chloride (NaCl) and glutaraldehyde (GA) were produced by Tianjin Fengchuan Chemical Reagent Technology Co., LTD. All chemicals are used without further refinement."
3,Preparation of PVA membrane,"2.2 Preparation of PVA membrane As is illustrated in Fig. 1 , PEG1000 (10% to the mass of PVA) and deionized (DI) water were put into a conical flask. After complete dissolution, 17.5 wt% PVA was added and stirred at 95 °C and 200 r/min for 2 h to fully dissolve the PVA, and then varied amount PTFE emulsion (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% to the mass of PVA) was added with further heating and stirring for 6 h. Casting solution was obtained with the PTFE particles evenly dispersed. The casting solution cooled naturally to room temperature (25 °C). Then, 0.2 mL hydrochloric acid and 2 wt% GA was added drop by drop slowly with gradually increasing the temperature from 25 °C to 60 °C. This solution was kept warm for 50 min and defrosted in a vacuum oven for 30 min. The casting solution was uniformly coated on the glass plate, followed by immersing in an ethanol coagulation bath. The membrane was formed by the NIPS process and then it was heated at 120 °C for 1 h. Chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane was successfully prepared. The membrane, without GA in the casting solution, was named heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane."
4,Membrane characterization,"2.3 Membrane characterization The morphology of the PVA/PTFE membrane was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Phenom XL, Holland) and true color confocal microscopy (CSM, CSM700, Germany). The chemical structure of the membrane surface was tested by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Nicolet iS50, USA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-alpha, USA). The water contact angle of the membrane surface was based on a dynamic contact angle measuring instrument (DSA100, Germany). The tensile properties of the membrane were tested using universal testing machine (FKV1000, China). The thermodynamic properties of the membrane were studied using simultaneous thermal analysis and mass spectrometry (STA449F3, Germany)."
5,Membrane separation performance,"2.4 Membrane separation performance The separation performance of the PVA/PTFE membrane was tested in a lab-scale cross-flow filtration system (Fig. S1) at 0.2 MPa and 25 °C. The membrane module was stabilized at 0.2 MPa for 30 min before data collection. The membrane flux is calculated using Eq. (1): (1) J W = V A ∗ t where JW is the flux (L/(m2h)), V is the volume of membrane permeation (L), A is the effective surface area of membrane (m2) and t is the testing time (h). The rejection of salt and alkali is calculated using Eq. (2): (2) R S % = C f , s − C p , s C f , s where Cf,s, and C p,s are the concentrations of the feed solution and permeation solution, respectively. In the process of testing the salt permeate performance, the conductivity meter is used to test the salt concentration of the feed liquid and the permeate liquid respectively. Acridine orange dye was utilized to characterize the cellulose removal performance of the membrane (Fig. S2). The CMC concentration in the test process was 1 g/L, the pressure at 0.2 MPa and 25 °C. In the process of determining CMC concentration, the standard curve of CMC was determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometer, and the CMC concentration corresponding to absorbance was calculated according to the standard curve (Fig. S3). Before the swelling test, the membranes were initially dried to a constant weight in the oven. Then, several groups of membranes with a mass of M1 (about 0.05 g) were weighed in an analytical balance and immersed in deionized water at room temperature for 2 h to achieve adsorption equilibrium. Finally, the membranes were carefully taken out and quickly dried the liquid on the membrane surface with filter paper and weighed as M2 in mass. The swelling degree of the membranes was calculated by Eq. (3). (3) η % = M 2 − M 1 M 1 where M1 and M2 are dry membrane weight (g) and the swelling after reaching adsorption equilibrium membrane weight (g); The anti-fouling property of the membrane was tested by using CMC (2 g/L) solution as the pollution model. The operating pressure was 0.2 MPa and the temperature was 25 °C. Flux recovery rate (FRR), total pollution (Rt), irreversible pollution (Rir), and reversible pollution (Rr) of membranes can be calculated by the following formula: (4) FRR % = J W 2 J W 1 × 100 (5) R t % = 1 − J p J W 1 × 100 (6) R ir % = J W 1 − J W 2 J W 1 × 100 (7) R r % = J W 2 − J p J W 1 × 100 where Rt = Rr + Rir, JW1 and JW2 are water flux before and after pollution, Jp is the flux in the CMC solution. Reversible membrane pollution is caused by concentration polarization, but irreversible pollution can be attributed to the adsorption and deposition of CMC on the membrane surface."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of PVA/PTFE membranes,"3.1 Characterization of PVA/PTFE membranes The intermolecular interaction between the PVA molecule and the cross-linking agent was investigated by FTIR. As shown in Fig. 2 , The peaks at 2925 cm−1 and 3400–3200 cm−1 can be assigned to -CH2- (stretching vibration), and OH (stretching vibration), respectively. Because there are a large number of hydroxyl groups on the PVA molecular chain and it is a multi-associative body, the absorption band shifted to low frequency. At the same time, it represented the existence of a host number of hydrogen bonds between PVA molecules, leading to its easy swelling characteristics [32]. The peaks at 1094 cm−1 and 1120 cm−1 can be associated with alcohol hydroxyl, and 1417 cm−1 and 1645 cm−1 can be indicated the -CH2- (bending vibration and variable angle vibration) and absorbed water (bending vibration). The peaks at 1176 cm−1 can be linked to the -CF2 group (symmetrical stretching) [33]. The peak at 1220 cm−1 should belong to the -C-O-C- bond (stretching vibration), which can be caused by the PVA self-cross-linking，and the cross-linking of GA and PVA. It indicated that both physical cross-linking and chemical cross-linking make the PVA membrane have a spatial cross-linking structure. The surface chemical composition of the PVA/PTFE membrane was measured with XPS. As showed in Fig. 3 (A), the full spectrum results showed that they are composed of C1s, O1s, and F1s peaks, and their electron binding energies are 285.0 eV, 532.2 eV, and 689.4 eV, respectively. Fitting and splitting the peaks of C1s as showed in Fig. 3(BD). It is found that there are two peaks of CO (286.6 eV) and C-C/C-H (285.0 eV) [34]. Compared to the three kinds of membranes, it is found that the uncross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane has a low CO peak intensity, indicated that PVA molecules are not dehydrated and the cross-linking has not proceeded. After heat cross-linking, the increasing intensity of the CO peak, suggested that the hydroxyl groups on the PVA segment were dehydrated and the ether bond began to form. After GA cross-linking, the CO peak intensity was the highest, indicated that cross-linking degree is more thorough by GA than that by heating. The C/O ratio and degree of crosslinking of the three membranes also showed that GA cross-linking is beneficial to the formation of the PVA cross-linking network (Table 1 ). TG and DTG curves of PVA/PTFE membranes showed after the cross-linking treatment, the thermodynamic properties of the membrane are stable and unchanged at the actual operating ambient temperature (Fig. S4). It can be seen from Fig. S4(B) that the three-stage weight loss of PVA is 50–150 °C, 275–400 °C, and 425–500 °C [35]. The membrane added with PTFE exhibited a fourth stage weight loss at 500–600 °C. The membranes begin to degrade at 50 °C, which was mainly due to the evaporation of water in the material. The second part was the rupture of the PVA molecular chain and the weight loss of hydroxyl groups. The third stage was the cyclization reaction and the weight loss of the remaining hydroxyl groups [36]. The fourth stage of weight loss was PTFE particles. Via chemical crosslinking, the weight loss temperature of the membrane shifted to high temperature. This showed that the cross-linked structure improved the thermal stability of the membrane. The crystallinity of the membranes was characterized by XRD in Fig. S5. There were two different peaks in the XRD pattern (18.15° and 19.80°). 2θ = 18.15° was the (100) crystal plane of PTFE [37]. 2θ = 19.80° represented the (101) crystal plane of PVA. With increasing the degree of cross-linking, the peaks became lower and wider, because the cross-linking diminished the intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds in PVA [38,39]. The intensity of the peaks at 18.15° and 19.80° decreased with the degree of the cross-linking, which indicated that the cross-linking hindered the crystallization of PVA molecular chains. During the heat treatment of PVA at 100–200 °C, the bound water was first removed, and then the molecules moved to form a crystal structure. Finally, the crystal structure was destroyed, and intermolecular dehydration and other transformations occurred [40]. During the heat treatment of PVA and PEG (120 °C 1 h), part of the PEG molecules are oxidized to form a new chemical bond-C-O-C-. The PEG molecules are bonded together. At the same time, PEG and PVA can form hydrogen bonds to improve the performance of the membrane. (as shown in Fig. 2, there was a -C-O-C- bond absorption peak at 1220 cm−1. Fig. 5 showed a slight decrease in the peak strength of XRD, which also indicated that the crystalline structure was destroyed in the heat treatment stage, so a partial cross-linking structure can be formed). Fig. 4 (A) showed that the surface of the pure PVA membrane is flat, without protrusions and no visible holes on the surface, resulting in no flux of the PVA membrane [41]. As showed in Fig. 4 (BD), PTFE particles can be seen on the surface of the membrane, leading to the formation of large interfacial pores on the surface of the membrane. This is mainly because PTFE particles are hydrophobic material, and PVA is a hydrophilic polymer. In the casting solution with water as the solvent, the incompatibility between the two phases makes the surface and interior of the membrane showed two-phase boundary interfacial pores, and plays a porogenic role [42]. Due to the addition of PTFE particles, during the phase inversion process of the membrane, there are gaps between the hydrophilic PVA and the hydrophobic PTFE particles. When immersed in an ethanol solution, water molecules are replaced, and the pores between the PVA and PTFE particles are filled with ethanol. After the membrane dries, a large number of pores are formed, which achieves the effect of pore formation. With the development of cross-linking, the surface of the membrane has a dense cross-linking structure and uniform distribution of the membrane surface pores. The bottom surface of the pure PVA membrane (Fig. 4(a)) showed large pores, while the pores shrunk significantly in the cross-linked membrane (Fig. 4 (b-d)). Folded structure was formed due to the dehydration and cross-linking of PVA molecules of the PVA/PTFE membranes. This folded structure would benefit to enhance the membrane performance and to improve the membrane strength. The addition of PTFE particles increased the pores inside the membrane, and the cross-section appeared consistent with the distribution of pores on the surface Fig. 4 (b’-d’), indicating that the prepared membranes have the same identity and are symmetrical membranes. This is mainly because the PTFE particles are uniformly dispersed in the membrane, and the pores between the two phases are evenly distributed, resulting in the same structure on the surface and inside of the membrane. The thickness of the membrane increased from 14.18 μm to 37.88 μm (Fig. S6), indicating that the addition of PTFE increased the porosity of the membrane and caused volume expansion. Heat cross-linking treatment and chemical cross-linking treatment did not change the membrane thickness much, indicating the cross-linking treatment only increased the cross-linking network of the membrane, but did not affect the basic structure of the membrane. The surface roughness of the PVA/PTFE membranes with different PTFE contents was obtained by true color confocal microscopy. In Fig. 5 (A-D), with the increase of PTFE content, the surface roughness of the membrane rose from 0.128 μm of pure PVA membrane to 0.767 μm of 15% PVA/PTFE membrane. The low roughness of the PVA/PTFE membrane with low PTFE content was contributed to the uniformly distribution of the PTFE particles in the membrane; However, roughness reached high to 0.767 μm with 15% PTFE content, due to the agglomeration of PFTE particles (Table S2). In order to verify the influence of the concentration of PTFE nanoparticles on the structure of the PVA/PTFE membrane, we conducted EDX experiments. As shown in Fig. 7 (a-d) of the EDX of the surface of the PVA/PTFE membrane, obvious agglomeration is noticed when the concentration of PTFE is more than 10%. it can be seen that the distribution of PTFE particles in the membrane is related to the surface roughness of the membrane. The main reason is that the content of PTFE in the membrane increases, and the dispersing effect of PTFE particles in the casting liquid is not good, which leads to local agglomeration during the membrane making process, which not only increases the internal defects of the membrane but also improves the surface roughness of the membrane."
8,Influence of cross-linking mode on membrane performance,"3.2 Influence of cross-linking mode on membrane performance The data of pure PVA/PTFE membrane were shown in Fig. S7. Under the condition of 0.1 MPa, the flux decreased rapidly with time, while the rejection increased. Both tend to be stable after 30 min, therefore, the stabilization of the membrane required a minimum of 60 min (Pre-load 30 min). The initially rejected solution contained cellulose molecules visible to the naked eye, but cellulose molecules disappeared in the rejected solution after 30 min, indicating that under the initial conditions of pure PVA/PTFE membrane, the membrane pores were too large to effectively reject CMC. Since PVA is a water-soluble polymer, its properties are still unstable after membrane formation only by NIPS, and it needs to be passed through cross-linking treatment to improve the stability of the membrane (Fig. S10). In Fig. 6 (A), as the temperature rose from 110 °C to 140 °C, the flux dropped from 387.26 (L/m2h) to 110.46 (L/m2h), and the rejection to CMC rose from 99.46% to 99.68%. In Fig. 8 (B), the time of heat treatment at 120 °C extended from 20 min to 120 min, the flux dropped from 759.76 (L/m2h) to 40.76 (L/m2h) and the rejection rose from 98.9% to 99.63%. With the increase of time and temperature of the heat treatment, more PVA molecules formed cross-linking network via dehydration of hydroxyl groups, resulting in a decrease in flux and an increase in rejection. As shown in Fig. 6 (C, D), the flux dropped from 359.76 (L/m2h) to 153.36 (L/m2h), and the rejection increased from 99.49% to 99.78% with increasing the GA concentration from 0% to 4%. At the same time, the elongation at break and tensile strength of the membrane increased from 28.96% to 463.80%, and from 25.18 MPa to 29.75 MPa, respectively. This was explained by the fact that increased energy is required for a fracture of the GA cross-linked PVA chains, resulting in the increases of both the tensile strength and elongation at the break of the membrane. It was found that when the GA amount was greater than 2%, flux and rejection of the membrane were stable and mechanical strength was good."
9,The separation performance of PVA/PTFE membranes,"3.3 The separation performance of PVA/PTFE membranes The performance of pure PVA/PTFE membrane under 0.1 MPa was shown in Fig. S9. With the increase of CMC concentration, the flux of pure PVA/PTFE membrane slowly dropped to equilibrium, and the rejection rate also slowly rose to around 99.20%. This is because solution viscosity and osmotic pressure increased with the increase of CMC concentration, accelerating the flux attenuation of the membrane. As shown in Fig. 9 (A, B), when the CMC concentration increased from 0.5 g/L to 3 g/L, the fluxes of both heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membranes and chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membranes decreased drastically. The main reasons were: 1) As the CMC concentration increased, concentration polarization caused more CMC molecules to aggregate, which increased the mass transfer resistance. 2) As the concentration of CMC solution increased, its viscosity became larger, and its binding force to water molecules increased. 3) As the concentration of CMC solution increased, the osmotic pressure increased, and the operating pressure was partially used to offset the osmotic pressure, resulting in a decrease in the actual driving pressure. Fig. 7 (C) showed that the flux and rejection of chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane for CMC solution increased with increasing the temperature of the feed solution from 25 °C to 50 °C. It indicated that the movement of water molecules was intensified at high temperature, contributing to the increased flux; and the entanglement and shrinking of the PVA molecules at high temperature, leading to enhancement of CMC rejection [11]. Therefore, it was benefit to improve the separation performance of the chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane by enhancing the processing temperature. The swelling degree of the membranes was shown in Fig. 7 (D). The swelling degree of the PVA/PTFE membrane is larger than that of the PVA membrane, due to the steric hindrance of the added PTFE particles to PVA. The swelling rate of the membranes decreased by heat cross-linking and chemical cross-linking, because less water binding to the cross-linked PVA [43]. The flux of pure PVA/PTFE membrane under 0.1 MPa was shown in Fig. S12. In NaOH/NaCl different concentrations (0.5–5 g/L), the trends of pure PVA/PTFE membranes were similar to those of PVA/PTFE membranes prepared by the two cross-linking strategies. However, in NaCl solution, compared with heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane, the flux decay of pure PVA/PTFE membrane was as high as 42.21%, and the NaCl transmittance was unchanged. Compared with the chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane, the flux attenuation was larger and the transmission rate of NaCl was lower. This was mainly due to the poor structural stability of pure PVA/PTFE and heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membranes. In NaOH solution, the flux of pure PVA/PTFE membrane only increased by 35.71% compared with that of heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane. The main reason was that the operating pressure was lower at 0.1 MPa, and the rate of OH− immersed into the membrane matrix decreases, which slowed down the destruction of membrane structure. Compared with the chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane, the transmittance of NaOH decreased. This indicated that a large amount of OH− was still consumed in the process of structural destruction in the membrane. The PVA/PTFE membrane flux and salt-alkali optional transmitting rate (OTR) in different concentrations of NaCl and NaOH aqueous solutions were tested. In Fig. 8 (A, B), with the increase of NaCl concentration, the flux of heat cross-linked and chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membranes decreased by 16.48% and 25.09%, respectively. However, the salt transmitting rate of the heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane is lower than that of the chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane, because the low degree of cross-linking of the heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane. And the electronegativity of the hydroxyl groups in the heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane was also more than that of the chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane. As shown in Fig. 8 (C, D), with the increase of NaOH concentration, the flux of heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane and chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane increased by 104.63% and 73.05%, respectively. When the NaOH concentration surpassed 2 g/L, the flux of the two membranes rose sharply due to the interaction between OH− and uncross-linked OH groups, which aggravated the swelling of the membrane, and even caused defects in the membranes. The molecular weight cut off of the two membranes may not be able to explain this problem (Fig. S13), but mass attenuation of the two cross-linked membranes in lye also explains this phenomenon (Fig. S14). However, at low concentrations, the alkali OTR of heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane and chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane were 88.62% and 97.21%, respectively, which were lower than those of salt OTR. The main reason was due to the hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl groups on the PVA molecular chain and OH−. On the other side, the alkali OTR of the heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane was lower than that of the chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane, because a large number of hydroxyl groups in the heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane inhibited the transport of OH− across the membrane [44]. To verify the membrane performance in the actual separation process, OTR and CMC rejection of the aqueous solutions with 1 g/L CMC and different concentrations of NaCl and NaOH were tested. As shown in Fig. 9 (A, B), with the increase of NaCl concentration, the flux of heat cross-linked and chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membranes decreased by 21.21% and 11.13%, respectively. OTR and CMC rejection of the two membranes were similar. The flux attenuation of the heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membranes in NaCl and CMC solution (21.21% in Fig. 9 (A)) was higher than that only in NaCl solution (16.48% in Fig. 8(A)), because the CMC tended to penetrate into the larger pores (Fig. S11 (A), 0.43 μm) of the heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membranes, resulting in partially blockage of the pores. However, The flux attenuation of the chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membranes in NaCl and CMC solution (11.13% in Fig. 9(B)) was much lower than that only in NaCl solution (25.09% in Fig. 8(B)). This mainly was due to the contamination of CMC on the surface of the chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membranes with smaller pore size and narrower pore size distribution (Fig. S11 (B)). A CMC buffer layer was produced on the membrane surface to hinder the enrichment of salt, which weakened the concentration polarization of the membrane. As shown in Fig. 9 (C, D), With the increase of NaOH concentration, the flux of heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane and chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane increased by 38.64% and 38.70%, respectively. Although the flux of the cross-linked membranes in NaCl and CMC solutions decreased on account of CMC deposition and concentration polarization, the flux of those membranes in NaOH and CMC solution increased owing to the deformation of the cross-linked structure of PVA at high NaOH concentration. At the same time, the alkali OTR of the two membranes in NaOH and CMC solution was greatly lower than that in the NaOH solution without CMC (Fig. 8 (C, D)), especially at low NaOH concentrations. The enrichment of CMC on the membrane surface and in the membrane pores, causing more hydroxyl groups from CMC interacting with PVA and NaOH, slowing down the transmission of OH−. Under the condition of high NaCl concentration (10 g/L), the heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane and the chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane still showed a stable processing capacity, the flux attenuation was small, and the CMC rejection and NaCl OTR increased slightly. Under the action of a high concentration of NaOH, the flux of the heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane increased by 74.09%, the CMC rejection rate was lower than 90%, and the NaOH OTR remained unchanged. The flux of the chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane increased by 46.74%, the CMC rejection rate was 93.30%, and the NaOH OTR remained stable. This showed that under high alkali conditions, the internal structure of the heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane was partially destroyed, and defects increased, which led to a decrease in membrane performance. The chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane has stronger tolerance and a more stable structure, which was suitable for high-alkali environments."
10,Anti-fouling ability comparison of commercial membrane and cross-linked PVA/PTFE membranes,"3.4 Anti-fouling ability comparison of commercial membrane and cross-linked PVA/PTFE membranes CMC (2 g/L) solution was used to simulate the membrane fouling process. To facilitate comparisons, all permeate fluxes were normalized based on the initial flux. As shown in Fig. 10 (A, B), the flux trend of the PVA/PTFE membrane and commercial membranes in water and CMC cycle tests with time was given. When the CMC solution replaced pure water, the flux decline rates were in the order of chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane (91.23%)>PAN membrane (86.89%)>PSF membrane (81.73%)>heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane (79.10%)>PES membrane (67.59%). It was found that the flux of the chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane decreased the most, resulting in the largest pollution, mainly due to the highest porosity of the membrane surface (Fig. S14), and the existence of a large number of small pores on the surface of the membrane (Fig. 6D), the membrane specific surface area was large, CMC molecules deposition on the membrane surface aggravated the membrane pollution. However, the surface porosity and specific surface area of the heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane were smaller (Fig. 6C), the deposition sites of CMC molecules on the membrane surface reduced, and the membrane fouling was less. After washing, the FRR of the chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane was the highest, while the FRR of the heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane was lower. This was because the CMC molecule itself also contained a large number of hydroxyl groups, which formed a hydrogen bond with the PVA molecular chain [45], preventing the separation of the CMC molecule. At the same time, there were more hydroxyl groups on the heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane, which can be more stably combined with CMC molecules, resulting in a decrease in the FRR of the heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane. Its hydrophilic membrane surface helping to remove the deposited CMC layer (Fig. S15). As shown in Fig. S16, the heat cross-linked and chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membranes still maintained a good flux recovery rate after 5 cycles. The flux recovery rate of heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane was stable at 79%, and the flux recovery rate of chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane was stable at 81% (Table S1). This showed that the anti-fouling performance of the membrane was stable. The flux attenuation caused mainly by two parts. Rir was mainly caused by CMC irreversible pollution to the membrane surface and pores, resulting in a significant decrease in membrane flux. After washing with water, the membrane flux recovered to a greater extent, and the recovered part is Rr. This was mainly because CMC formed an unstable filter cake layer on the membrane surface under the effect of concentration polarization [46], which resulted in augmented mass transfer resistance and greater flux attenuation. It showed that concentration polarization has the greatest impact on membrane performance."
11,Stability of the membrane,"3.5 Stability of the membrane Fig. 11 showed the stability test by separating the CMC solution of the heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane and chemical cross-linking PVA/PTFE membrane. It is found that the flux of the heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane decreases by 42.99% from the initial to 24 h and its rejection rate remains at 98.50%. The flux of chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane remained balanced after 4 h, only attenuated by 16.77%, and the flux remained at 89.20 L/m2h. The rejection rate remained at 99.40%. It showed that the chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane had better stability. Fig. S17 shows the surface morphology of the two membranes after 24 h of operation, indicating that the chemically crosslinked membranes have good structural stability."
12,Performance comparison of reports in literature,"3.6 Performance comparison of reports in literature In this study, we prepared a cross-linked PVA bulk membrane with blending PTFE particles. However, most studied on PVA membranes in literature were the ones with PVA coating on ceramic (Al2O3) or organic (PE or PVDF) support membranes (Table 3 ). Therefore, the hydrophilic PVA/PTFE membranes with low water contact angles (around 24°) were suitable for separation chemicals, such as CMC, with high rate of reversible fouling and moderate flux. At the same time, the high rejection to CMC (more than 99.3%) and high OTR to salt and alkali (more than 90%) made those cross-linked PVA/PTFE membranes have great potential in separation of waste cellulose derivates and salts."
13,Conclusion,"In this study, a series of PVA/PTFE membranes with different PTFE contents were prepared through heat cross-linking and chemical cross-linking. The separation performance of the membranes in the mixture of CMC, salt and alkali was studied. The results concluded that PVA/PTFE UF membrane has obvious advantages in CMC rejection rate (99.3% for heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane and 99.4% for chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane) and salt-alkali passage (93.0% for heat cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane and 93.4% for chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane). The chemical cross-linked PVA/PTFE membrane has a good separation performance in CMC/NaCl/NaOH wastewater with a high CMC rejection rate to 95.3% and OTR more than 90%. The cross-linked PVA/PTFE membranes showed excellent anti-fouling property and stability in alkali conditions, suggesting a great potential in the treatment of cellulose derivates wastewater."
