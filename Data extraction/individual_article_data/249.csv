0,Introduction,"The Paris Agreement on Climate Change targets at 1.5 °C global temperature increase by 2100. To reach this target, it is imperative to deploy the sustainable strategies, i.e. both to reduce anthropogenic emissions in related sectors towards zero level and also capture CO2 from the atmosphere for negative emissions [1–4]. As an essential source of renewable energy, solar energy annually intercepted by our Planet can reach ∼ 49,800 exajoules, which is over 25 times higher than the projected global primary energy consumption (1,900 exajoules) in year 2100 [5]. However, our utilization of solar energy still needs huge improvement as seen from this fact: the most matured solar photovoltaics (PV) only supplies 2.8 % of the global electricity production in 2019 [6]. With world population and human activities forecast to increase, it is of vital importance to diversify solar harnessing methods beyond solar PV [7]. One such promising zero-emission technology is the phototransformation of light alcohols (PTLAs), such as methanol, ethanol and iso-propanol, etc., in hydrogen fuel and useful chemical feedstocks. Generally, the PTLAs involves dehydrogenation steps that convert LAs into clean hydrogen fuel for fuel cells, and carbonyl compounds (e.g. aldehydes, ketones, and/or carboxylic acids, etc.) for producing wide varieties of organic compounds with applications including as fragrances, food, agrochemicals, materials and pharmaceuticals, etc [8]. To date studies on H2 fuel production from LAs typically use promoters (e.g., water [9–13], acid [14–16], and base [17,18]). Promoters benefit catalytic reactions, but there still remain problems: water promoter based reactions emit CO2; and acid/base promoters limit catalyst selection, and lead to complicated product purification and cost increase [15,19]. Promoter-free strategies for PTLAs are thus becoming increasingly attractive. While promoter-free strategies have been developed, some issues remain, such as greenhouse gases emissions [20–23], reliance on noble metals [24–27], and the requirement for full UV light irradiation [28]. Recently, our group made a breakthrough by overcoming the above issues using monocomponent MoS2. However, the short lifetime of the carriers restricted H2 production efficiency (617 μmol h−1 g−1), and generated gaseous formaldehyde. This in turn needs ∼ 5 atm pressure to be liquefied, thus complicating product (H2-formaldyhyde) separation [29]. This has inspired us to explore new strategies to address above combined challenges. As a widely applied 2D semiconductor photocatalyst, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is based on abundant elements, and has excellent photochemical stability, a visible light responsive bandgap (∼ 2.7 eV), and Lewis and Brönsted basic functions [30–35]. The noble-metal free SnS also tends to form 2D structures but has a near infrared bandgap, complementing g-C3N4 [36]. Taking advantage of these properties, a 2D/2D heterojunction between g-C3N4 and SnS is first developed to evaluate the performance of PTLAs for photocatalytic alcohol to self-separable hydrogen (PATH) and valuable chemicals. The characteristics and catalytic behaviour of 2D SnS/g-C3N4 are then elucidated in detail, and the reaction mechanism explored."
1,Experimental section,

H2 (99.999 %), Ar (99.997 %) and CO2 (99.95 %) were purchased from BOC gas, Australia."
3,Preparation of photocatalysts,"2.2 Preparation of photocatalysts 2.2.1 Preparation of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) sample A desired amount of melamine was placed in a crucible and heated the crucible in a furnace at 600 °C for 4 h with a ramping rate of 10 °C/min. Grinding of the resultant products affords yellow powder of g-C3N4. 2.2.2 Synthesize of SnS/g-C3N4 photocatalysts To prepare SnS/g-C3N4 photocatalysts, firstly, 0.5 g of tin (ii) chloride and 0.19 g of thioacetamide were added into 40 mL deionized (DI) water (18.2 Ωm) with varying amounts of surfactant CTAB. After a homogeneous solution was obtained, the desired amount of yellow colored g-C3N4 powder was mixed with this solution under continuous stirring at room temperature. The resultant suspension was then transferred into an autoclave followed by heating at 180 °C for 24 h. The resultant solid was collected after cooling down and subsequently cleaned by washing with DI water for three times followed by drying at 60 °C for 12 h. The obtained solid was further annealed at 400 °C for 2 h in argon under atmospheric pressure. After annealing, the final solid turned black and was used for all the experiments. Various SnS content loadings of 5, 10, 20, and 33.33 wt% (the weight ratio of Sn precursor to g-C3N4) was prepared by following the above procedure."
4,Characterization of photocatalysts,"2.3 Characterization of photocatalysts High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDS) characterizations were performed on a 200 kV JEOL JEM 2100 HR-TEM at room temperature. Images were captured by a TVIPS TemCam-XF416 CMOS camera. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) elemental maps of the materials were acquired by an Oxford X-Max 80 mm2 silicon drift EDS detector. STEM-EDS elemental mapping was done on 200 kV JEOL 2100 F FEGTEM and Scanning Electron microscopy (SEM) was performed using a Zeiss Ultraplus analytical FESEM at Center for Advanced Microscopy, Australian National University. The samples were prepared with ethanol solution and deposited on Si substrate for SEM analysis. UV–vis measurement was conducted on Cintra 2020 (GBC scientific Equipment) using quartz cuvette as a sample container. A blank without sample was measured as background before testing the samples. Powder X-ray diffraction measurement was done on a PANalytical Empyrean XRD using Cu Kα (λ=1.5406 Å) radiation with a generator voltage and current of 45 kV and 40 mA, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Nexsa (ThermoFisher Scientific) spectrometer. The system work function was calibrated for each sample by setting the main line of the C 1s spectrum to 284.8 eV. Each high resolution spectrum was fitted with a Gaussian-Lorentzian (70 %-30 %) line shape using a Shirley background. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurement was done on a commercial Bruker E500 spectrometer equipped with an ER4122 SHQ resonator with the following parameters: 150 mW, 9.8 GHz light and 0.5 G modulation amplitude. Liquid solution EPR measurements were analysed using a quartz flat cell. For spin trap experiments, 3 mg of SnS/g-C3N4 samples was dispersed in 10 mL solvent (methanol/ethanol/iso-propanol), followed by solar illumination for 4 h at room temperature. For each alcohol, the same procedure was carried out to produce mutiple EPR spectra for average. A small volume of the illuminated solution was then mixed with a certain volume of DMPO aqueous solution (150 mM). The reaction mixture was then used for EPR measurement. For reference purpose, an aliquot of this mixture was taken prior to illumination and its EPR spectrum was recorded. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurement was performed using XAFCA beamline at the Singapore Synchrotron Light Source (SSLS) [37]. XAFS spectra were obtained in Sn L edge at room temperature. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurement was done on Bruker Alpha II FTIR spectroscopy equipped with an ATR accessory in the range of 200−4000 cm−1. Spectra were converted into absorbance by Bruker OPUS software. Thermal gravimetric (TGA) measurement was performed on a TGA Q 500 instrument in the range of 25–800 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 flow rate of 40 mL/min. 3 mg of each sample was used for TGA measurement. Electrochemical impedance was done on a PARSTAT 3000 station with at three different frequencies (1.2 kHz, 2.4 kHz and 4.8 kHz) at a constant voltage of 0.5 V. A traditional three electrode system was used, in which saturated Ag/AgCl electrode, Pt wire and a self-made electrode deposited with photocatalysts act as reference, counter and working electrodes respectively. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was obtained with Horiba LabRAM system equipped with a confocal microscope, a charge-coupled device Si detector (detection range between 532 − 1600 nm). The excitation wavelength was 405 nm used to acquire the PL spectrum for the studied materials."
5,Photocatalysis test,"2.4 Photocatalysis test Photocatalytic hydrogen production from methanol was conducted in a 15 mL quartz bottle reactor with a silicone rubber septum under room temperature and atmospheric pressure. A 300 W Microsolar lamp (Beijing Perfect light Technology Co., Ltd) with an optical filter of AM 1.5 G was horizontally placed alongside the reactor. A certain amount of photocatalyst was added into the reactor while 90 min sonication was performed to disperse the photocatalysts in 10 mL alcohol (methanol/ethanol/iso-propanol). After that, the reactor was degassed by Ar gas for another 30 min to remove the residual air from the reactor. The products from the photocatalytic methanol decomposition were analysed by GC (Nexis 2030, Shimadzu Scientific instruments) which equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and a flame ionization detector (FID) and a ShinCarbon (100/120, 1 mm ID, 1/16ʹʹ OD) column. Before and after light irradiation, 50 μL of aliquot from the dead space of the reactor was taken out by a micro-syringe and manually injected into the GC, which then worked as references. Typically, the photocatalytic reaction was carried out for 4 h, while the irradiation time for stability test was varied between methanol, ethanol and iso-propanol. An Agilent 7890 A GC equipped with a FID and 7010 Triple Quadruple GC/MS/MS with helium as carrier gas were used to analyse the end products after photocatalytic reaction. Injections were split in 100:1 with a split flow of 150 mL/min and delivered through an autosampler. The inlet temperature was 220 °C, while oven temperature was set in the range of 40−240 °C, among which a ramping rate of 5 °C/min was applied in the range of 40−100 °C with no hold time and another ramping rate of 20 °C/min used in the range of 100−240 °C with a hole time of 3.5 min. Scans were measured from 10 mass to 300 mass using 300 ms scan time. The FID temperature was set to 250 °C and the injection volume was 1 μL."
6,Site-selective photodeposition of Ag and MnOx,"2.5 Site-selective photodeposition of Ag and MnOx The selective growth of Ag and MnOx on SnS/g-C3N4 heterojunction was performed with slight modification from previous method [38–40]. The site-selective photodeposition was conducted in a 15 mL quartz bottle reactor with a silicone rubber septum under room temperature and atmospheric pressure. In a typical approach, a certain amount of photocatalyst was added into the reactor followed by mixing the AgNO3 (0.2 mM) and trisodium citrate (Na3C6H5O7, 4 mM) into DI water (10 mL). After that, we have performed 30 min sonication to homogeneously mix the all ingredients in the reactor. Next, the reactor was degassed by Ar gas for another 30 min to remove the residual air from the reactor. A 300 W Microsolar lamp (Beijing Perfect light Technology Co., Ltd) with an optical filter of AM 1.5 G was horizontally placed alongside the reactor for 3 h illumination. After completion of irradiation, the sample was centrifuged and cleaned with DI water for five times followed by drying at 60 °C for 12 h. The photodeposition of MnOx was similar to Ag deposition except that 0.2 mM of MnCl2 added into DI water without any stabilizer and illuminated for 24 h."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Materials characterization,"3.1 Materials characterization Powder X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed to reveal the nature of the crystallinity of the materials prepared in this work. In Fig. 1 a, the characteristic peak associated with g-C3N4 can be observed at 2θ = 27.78°, which has been reported as the (002) plane with a d-spacing of 0.32 nm [41]. This can be ascribed to the interlayer stacking of the conjugated aromatic system. The crystal structure analysis reveals that the SnS appeared with multiple peaks, consistent with previous studies on SnS [42]. After forming a heterojunction with 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets (see Note S1, Fig. S1a), SnS retains its all feature peaks with one new peak at 2θ = 27.78° which is from (002) planes of g-C3N4. This indicates that 2D g-C3N4 was successfully integrated with SnS without shifting the positions of characteristic diffraction peaks. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was performed to study the prepared materials. In Fig. 1b, the lattice fringes separated by a c.a. 0.32 nm distance can be ascribed to the (002) plane of g-C3N4 nanosheets. A layered SnS (orthorhombic) (see Fig. S1b) phase with interplanar d-spacing of c.a. 0.28 nm was observed in Fig. 1c, which can be attributed to the (111) plane d-spacing of SnS. The SAED pattern (inset in Fig. 1c) reveals the polycrystalline nature of SnS, consistent with XRD results, while representing some larger grains with preferred orientation. Additionally, SnS nanosheets have a lateral size of up to tens of nanometers. The TEM image of SnS/g-C3N4 heterostructures shows that SnS nanosheets are randomly and tightly anchored near the edges of g-C3N4 sheets (Fig. 1d). Both HRTEM image and SAED pattern confirm that the heterostructures consist of both SnS and g-C3N4 components (Fig. S1c), as evidenced by the characteristic interplanar distances of 0.32 nm and 0.28 nm corresponding to (002) planes of g-C3N4 and (111) planes of SnS, respectively, (Fig. 1e and its inset). STEM-EDS elemental mapping verifies the co-existence and indicates the spatial distribution of C, N, S, and Sn species in the heterostructures, as shown in Fig. 1f. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to obtain surface chemical states of the photocatalysts. The survey spectrum of SnS/g-C3N4 heterojunction shows the signals of S, Sn, C, and N elements (Fig. S2), indicating their coexistence. Seen from Fig. 2 a, the binding energies of Sn 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 in SnS/g-C3N4 were shifted to 486.23 eV and 494.45 eV compared with those of 486.81 eV and 495.10 eV in SnS, respectively. The binding energies of these two orbitals can be ascribed to the Sn2+, providing evidence for the existence of SnS, and their small shifts in SnS/g-C3N4 compared with SnS suggest some interactions between the SnS and g-C3N4 nanosheets [43,44]. The S 2p spectrum is a doublet (Fig. 2b) representing the spin-orbit splitting of the S 2p3/2 (S2− phase) and S 2p1/2 lines (S2− phase), while observing minor So impurities [45]. After forming the heterojunction, both the peaks of S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 shifted to lower binding energies around 161.44 and 162.64 eV, respectively, which, however, represents the monosulfide phase of the surface [46]. As shown in Fig. 2c, the deconvolution of C 1s peak generates characteristic peaks at 288.20 and 284.44 eV ascribed to the sp2-bonded C atom bonded to N within the s-triazine ring (NCN) and sp2 CC in graphitic carbon, respectively, while the weak peak at 286.20 eV indicates possible surface oxidation of carbon (for example CO) [47]. It is likely that the synthesis of g-C3N4 plays a role in this oxidation. After forming the heterostructure, the peak intensities of NCN bonds undergo a slight energy reduction to 288.14 eV, indicating the nature of highly ordered g-C3N4 nanosheets [47]. A new peak at 285.90 eV with a marginal height is observed, which could be attributed to a higher oxidization state of C atoms in CO bonds [47]. In Fig. 2d, the spectrum deconvolution of N 1s of pure g-C3N4 shows three peaks, which are attributed to sp2-bonded nitrogen (N–CN, 398.47 eV), a resonance form of the melamine structure involving –NH2 group (400.95 eV) [48] and Π excitation of carbon atom (403.77 eV) [49]. However, the peak at 401.1 eV is assigned to CNH uncondensed amino (-NH2) groups, signalling the incomplete loss of NH3 from melamine [47,48] while peak at 404.44 eV coincides with same Π excitation within the s-triazine [48,49]. Basically, the electron density could induce the variation of binding energies because of electron screening effects. Once 2D g-C3N4 forms junction with SnS, the interfacial charge carrier migration would result in significantly different variation the in electron concentration, hence making the binding energies shift toward lower energy or higher energy direction [46,50,51]. The deconvolution of the C 1s, N 1s, Sn 3d and S 2p peak areas provides indication about the component mole ratio in the heterojunction and it is found that about 62 % of SnS interact with g-C3N4 surface (Table S1). The above XPS results are consistent with the XRD (Fig. 1a) and FT-IR results (see Fig. S3). In order to investigate the electronic structure of the resulting SnS nanosheets on the g-C3N4 surface, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy was performed for both SnS and SnS/g-C3N4 heterostructure. Theoretically, the L-edge XAFS spectra of Sn has L1, L2 and L3 edges where L1, L2 and are ascribed to the transition of electrons from 2s1/2 to np3/2, 2p1/2 to nd3/2 and 2p3/2 to nd5/2 states, respectively [52]. It is clearly evident from Fig. 2e that there are a white line (∼ 3955 eV) and some fine structures in the L3-edge region. The zoom in figure shows that the white line is significantly different before and after forming the heterojunction [52]. The peak intensities of the white line and the fine structures for SnS/g-C3N4 were significantly changed from those of SnS, associated with the electronic structure change after forming the heterojunction due to the presence of unoccupied 5d-symmetry orbitals in SnS [52]. By analysing the L3 white line and the peak intensities for SnS and SnS/g-C3N4 heterojunction, it is revealed that there may be a strong interaction built up between SnS nanosheets and 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets."
9,Evaluation on PTLAs,"3.2 Evaluation on PTLAs A description of all operating parameters and their optimization in terms of PATH efficiency, including surfactant loadings, growth time, annealing temperature and pressure, catalyst dosage, effects of bare catalysts and heavier alcohols, and solar light intensity are optimized for SnS/g-C3N4 photocatalyst in terms of PATH efficiency (see Note S2, Fig. S4a-e, Fig. S5a, b, c, Fig. S6a, b, Fig. S7a, b, and Fig. S8). After the optimization of the SnS/g-C3N4 photocatalyst in PTLAs, its stability was further examined for different alcohols by employing AM 1.5 G filter. As seen from Fig. 3 a, the H2 production increases over the irradiation time until reaches a plateau after 100 h. This is because the produced H2 inside the reactor will build up partial pressure and hence slow down methanol decomposition, and, the active sites of SnS/g-C3N4 may be partially blocked by the adsorption of evolved liquid products. After three cycles of experiment (120 h for each cycle), about 1273.692, 1173.745, and 1140.358 μmole. g−1. h−1 of H2 was released from methanol in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd cycle, respectively (Table 1 ), indicating the PATH efficiency in the next cycle was as high as ∼ 95 % that of the previous cycle. These efficiencies are more than twice the reported values [29]. Taking methanol as a model PTLAs, the apparent quantum efficiency was calculated to be 5.78 % while the solar to hydrogen efficiency (STH) conversion efficiency was around 2.46 % (Note S3). Apart from methanol, ethanol can also be decomposed by SnS/g-C3N4 while it remains stable for 90 h (Fig. 3b). In a similar fashion, iso-propanol system was examined for H2 formation whereas the stability test for iso-propanol is found to be relatively shorter (72 h) than those of methanol and ethanol test (Fig. 3c). This is because the in-situ produced acetone may experience hydrogenation, reducing the H2 generation further [53]. The initial and specific reaction rates for photo-redox induced methanol, ethanol, and iso-propanol systems were also determined using the nth order polynomial fit for each cycle (Table 1). Clearly, Table 1 shows that the photocatalytic performance can be maintained at about 95 % in the subsequent cycle for all the three light alcohols, and the initial and specific reaction rates enabled by photo-excitation are in close proximity for each PTLAs. All these consistently demonstrated reaction reversibility using 2D SnS/g-C3N4 heterojunction. Importantly, the stability of SnS/g-C3N4 heterojunction before and after PTLAs reactions was verified using the powder XRD patterns, which showing same characteristic peaks (Note S4, Fig. S13a). This can be further co-supported by excellent thermos-stability even under 450 °C (Fig. S13b). More importantly, the ultra-efficient PTLAs to hydrogen conversion over SnS/g-C3N4 heterojunction has an extra advantage over traditional thermos-catalytic processes [54–56] since it is still completely free from COx side-products (Note S5, Fig. S14, S15 and Table S2). The liquid-phase products were investigated by GC-FID and gas-chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy (GC/MS/MS) (Note S6, Fig. S16-21). Methylal and methyl formate (MF) appeared after methanol decomposition in Fig. 3d, and 1, 1-diethoxyethane (DEE), ethyl acetate (EA), and acetaldehyde emerged after ethanol decomposition in Fig. 3e. The scenario for iso-propanol was simpler, showing only one peak assigned to acetone (Fig. 3f). However, among the liquid products, the selectivity, or product distribution, of producing methylal and MF was calculated to be 54.28 and 45.71 %, respectively, over methanol photodecomposition, wherein 95.59, 2.38 and 2.01 % for DEE, EA and acetaldehyde in ethanol system, respectively. Evidently, with the SnS/g-C3N4 heterojunction in this work, the reaction pathways and resultant products are different from the previous works where the gaseous formaldehyde was consistently observed in methanol photodecomposition [28,29]. Compared with gaseous formaldehyde, our received liquid methylal and MF can be easily separated from H2 fuel. Furthermore, the ethanol decomposition shows a much higher selectivity of DEE over the acetaldehyde formation, and only one main product of acetone (100 % selectivity) was generated from iso-propanol (Fig. S16-21). All these provide evidence that the employed SnS/g-C3N4 heterojunction can multivalorize LAs by selectively generating a wide category of valuable liquid chemicals with H2 fuel."
10,SnS/g-C3N4 Z-scheme heterojunction enabled photoredox activities,"3.3 SnS/g-C3N4 Z-scheme heterojunction enabled photoredox activities Among electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, Nyquist plots can describe the nature of charge transfer across the SnS/g-C3N4 heterojunction. As is seen from Fig. 4 a, the curvature radius of the composite is much smaller than that of pure g-C3N4 and SnS. This implies that the SnS/g-C3N4 heterojunction effectively improves charge carrier transport after separation. Mott-Scottky analysis was performed to provide insight into the band structures of g-C3N4 and SnS as shown in Fig. 4b. The Mott-Scottky plot of SnS shows a negative slope, suggesting its p-type nature, while that of g-C3N4 has a positive slope, which indicates an n-type semiconductor. [57] The flat band potentials can be estimated from the x-axis intercepts of the linear region, with values of 1.45 V and -1.58 V (vs Ag/AgCl) obtained for SnS and g-C3N4, respectively. [58] Using the bandgap (Note S7, Fig. S22) and Mott-Schottky data, the potential Z-scheme band diagram was plotted as shown in Fig. 4c. It is known that charge carriers can easily transfer across the interfaces and the recombination/coupling between electrons from SnS and holes from g-C3N4 is greatly enhanced in Z-scheme heterojunction [59], which benefit the electron-hole separations for both SnS and g-C3N4, thus substantially extending the lifetime of both electrons@g-C3N4 and holes@SnS. The electron-hole separation of SnS/g-C3N4 heterojunction was significantly improved compared with that of pure g-C3N4, which was verified by the dramatically decreased (∼100 times) photoluminescence intensity of g-C3N4 after forming heterojunction (Fig. 4d) [46]. The spatially-separated longer-lifetime electrons at conduction band (CB) of g-C3N4 and holes at valence band (VB) of SnS directly improved heterojunction’s PATH performance, compared with single components (SnS or g-C3N4), and also modified reaction pathways during PTLAs. It is worth highlighting here that the above mentioned p-type SnS and n-type g-C3N4 forms a Z-scheme heterojunction instead of a conventional p-n heterojunction [60,61]. The reason is that the electrons tend to remain at g-C3N4 and holes stay at SnS, thus forming a direct Z-scheme junction, and no depletion region exists in the atomically thin area to form a p-n heterojunction [60,61]. However, the strong peak located at 480 nm is attributed to the transition between the lone pair (LP) valence band and the Π* conduction band with energy more than 2 eV, which is a characteristics signature for materials like carbon nitride as shown in Fig. 4d [62]. Other two peaks located at 495 and 540 nm are ascribed to the localized defect-related states that endow various kinds of radiative recombination [63,64]. One way to identify such radiative recombination is the broadening of PL emissions which are clearly observed from Fig. 4d. Besides carrier lifetime extension, the Z-scheme heterojunction can also widen the spatial separation of reductive/oxidative energy levels of photoexcited electrons/holes so as to possess high redox capacities [66]. In this work, high oxidative capacity over the Z-scheme structure was investigated by EPR, where the free radical intermediates during the PLTAs were studied, as shown in Fig. 4e. In presence of 5, 5-Dimethyl-1-Pyrroline-N-Oxide (DMPO) spin trap, oxygen centered radical intermediates such as CH3O , CH3CH2O , and (CH3)2CHO were detected, for methanol, ethanol and iso-propanol, respectively. Radical yields were highest for iso-propanol and methanol. These short-lived intermediates were also captured as fragmented molecules in GC-MS-MS experiments (Fig. S16-21). Based on the above analyses, it is inferred that the abovementioned free radical intermediates were generated from the alcohol molecules through the oxidization by photoexcited holes from valence band of SnS. These intermediates will be further transformed into carbon-centered radical which undergoes combination/disproportionation reaction to form the specific liquid products as discussed in next section. Meanwhile, the liberated protons from alcohol molecules were reduced to H2 by accepting the electrons from conduction band of g-C3N4. In order to verify the proposed Z-scheme mechanism working for reducing the alcohol molecules into H2 and other valuable chemicals, we have performed selective grown of Ag and MnOx on the surface of heterojunction under the solar irradiation. The results of the site selective photodeposition were analysed through STEM-EDS elemental mapping as shown in Fig S23 and 24. As shown in Fig S23 that the photoproduced electrons at CB of g-C3N4 bring about the photoreduction of Ag+ to Ag, which mostly distributed on the g-C3N4 surface. This is because the electrons mostly concentrated on the CB and readily available for the reduction reaction. Note that the elemental distribution of Sn slightly populates the Ag distribution in the mapping due to the fine structure of the characteristics x-ray lines (Lα) for both elements cannot be resolved well under STEM analysis. However, the elemental distribution of sulphur shows that photodeposition of Ag particles is dominant on the g-C3N4, not SnS, surface in the heterojunction. Opposite to the Ag growth on the heterojunction, the photogenerated holes at VB of SnS prompted the photooxidation reaction of Mn2+, which resulting in very preferential MnOx deposition on the SnS surface as observed from Fig S24. The distribution of MnOx is obviously on the SnS site, indicating that the photooxidation of Mn2+ was basically driven by the localized photoinduced holes on the VB. The above results verify the proposed Z-scheme mechanism, which can effectively separate the photoproduced electrons and holes in space after charge carriers (electrons from SnS and holes from g-C3N4) directionally transfer across the interfaces for recombination. As a result, a neat balance of the photoproduced electrons and holes to the respective reductive and oxidative sites could be attained, which enhanced the photoredox performance from alcohols."
11,Reaction mechanism,"3.4 Reaction mechanism The mechanism of methanol photooxidation (Scheme 1 ) has been described previously [67]. It begins with the photoexcitation of the catalyst, upon which it undergoes an electron transfer reaction with methanol [29]. The resulting methanol radical cation readily deprotonates to afford the methoxy radical, which can then undergo further reaction [68,69]. The catalyst is regenerated by a further electron transfer reaction with the proton to afford hydrogen. The methoxy radical (CH3O ) readily undergoes a 1, 2 intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer to form the more stable carbon-centered radical [70]. In the absence of oxygen or other reagents, the only radical sinks are hydrogen atom transfer with methanol, a null reaction, or bimolecular radical termination. Termination can occur in two ways: the carbon centered radical can combine with the original methoxy radical to afford a hydroxy ether (A in Scheme 1), or it can undergo combination or disproportion with another carbon-centered radical. In this latter case, disproportion is favoured for steric reasons and leads to production of formaldehyde (B in Scheme 1) and methanol (starting material). The resulting products can then undergo further reactions. Specifically, the hydroxy ether A can either react with further methanol via the Tishchenko Reaction [71] to afford methylal (C in Scheme 1), or it can react with the acetaldehyde B via standard aldehyde protection chemistry [72] to afford methyl formate (D in Scheme 1) and methanol (starting material). Product analysis shows that only methylal and methyl formate are observed in similar amounts, which is consistent with the initial generation of both A and B, both of which react further to form C and D. For higher alcohols, ethanol and iso-propanol, the same basic reaction scheme is possible, although the product ratios differ. Specifically, the reactivity of B declines with increasing substitution to the extent that in the case of iso-propanol, B is a ketone rather than an aldehyde and formation of D is impossible. For ethanol, some ethyl formate (D) is formed but unreacted acetaldehyde (B) is also observed, and the major product is thus 1, 1-diethoxyethane (C). Additionally, the relative populations of the oxygen and carbon-centred radical tautomers increasingly favours the carbon-centred radical as it becomes more substituted, and hence more stabilized. This, along with increasing steric hindrance, results in decreasing cross-termination between the oxygen and carbon centred radicals (and hence decreasing formation of A and products derived from A), in favour of the disproportionation products (i.e. B), which in the case of iso-propanol are formed exclusively."
12,Conclusion,"In this work, we show that 2D SnS/g-C3N4 heterostructures exhibit ultra-efficient and -stable phototransformation of light alcohols without any promoter at room temperature and free from COx by-products. The multivalorized products, i.e. H2 fuel and liquid products, are easily self-separable. The hydrogen production efficiency from each studied alcohol exceeds the corresponding reported values whereas and furthermore is demonstrated excellent reversibility (>95 %) during long-term operations (up to 360 h in total). The mechanism was proposed based on reactive intermediates, derivative products and products selectivities. The phototransformation of light alcohols by 2D SnS/g-C3N4 heterostructures in this work exemplifies selective reaction pathways, where the unreactive alcohols can be activated as intermediates, for further combination/disproportionation towards valued liquid products. Some key advantages of this work: (i) mutivalorization of PTLAs into self-separable H2 fuel and liquid products; (ii) greater utilization of H elements from alcohol molecules for high H2 production efficiency with excellent reversibility; (iii) selective redox reactions to avoid COx formation; and (iv) in-situ combination/disproportionation of carbonyl products into higher value-added liquid chemicals. This work will advance the existing understanding of the selective roles of photoexcited electrons/holes in the heterojunction to attain the valuable fine products with zero emissions, and provide inspiration for the design of zero-emission catalysts with high product selectivity for various solar-based applications."
