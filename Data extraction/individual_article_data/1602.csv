0,Introduction,"The global depletion of crude oil requires new technologies to be developed for the production of synthetic fuels and chemicals from alternative energy resources. For this reason the interest in the century-old Fischer–Tropsch (F–T) synthesis [1] has been renewed in recent years. While in traditional F–T synthesis, syngas (H2 + CO) is mainly converted into hydrocarbons over iron- or cobalt-based catalysts [2–4], recent efforts have also been devoted to the production of higher terminal alcohols which can be used directly as “alkanol” fuels or fuel additives to boost the octane rating, and intermediates for valuable chemicals such as plasticizers, lubricants and detergents [5–8]. The present large-scale production of higher terminal alcohols is based on homogeneous hydroformylation of C n (n ≥ 3) petroleum-derived terminal olefins with H2 and CO [9,10] which, however, involves the formation of branched aldehydes/alcohols due to the Markovnikov rule. Therefore, the advantages of higher alcohols synthesis via heterogeneous F–T synthesis are related to the polymerization-type chain growth mechanism providing mainly, if not exclusively, terminal alcohols/aldehydes from syngas in the absence of a target olefin. Various types of heterogeneous catalysts including Rh noble metal [11–15], CoCu [16–28] and CuZn [29,30] mixed metals as well as hydrodesulfurization-type MoS2 [31–33] were all tested for higher alcohols synthesis via CO hydrogenation. CoCu-based catalysts were found to be among the most promising ones for various reasons. As compared to Rh noble metal, they would simply be much more cost-effective, and with respect to activity and selectivity, they would most probably outperform both CuZn and MoS2. CoCu-based catalysts for higher alcohols synthesis were first developed by the Institut François du Pétrole (IFP) in the later 1970s [34]. They reported the formation of C1–C6 mixed iso- and n-alcohols over catalysts promoted with V, Cr, Zn, Al and Mn etc. [35–39]. The feed gases used at IFP were either CO/CO2 H2 or COH2, where the former was operated in a manner similar to the industrial methanol synthesis (the selectivity of alcohols was calculated excluding CO2). After the initial reports by IFP, a large number of patents (filed by Mobil Oil, BP and Chem Systems) [40–43] and papers [17–20,44,45] focusing on promoted CoCu catalysts for higher alcohols saw the light of the day. More recently, such catalysts have been examined in detail [21–30,46–63]. It seems to be clear by now that the detailed catalyst formulation as well as the methods of their preparation are key to the performance for higher alcohols synthesis."
1,Design and synthesis of cobalt–copper catalysts,"While IFP chose to prepare their CoCu-based catalysts either by co-precipitation of the respective metal carbonates or by thermal decomposition of a homogeneous precursor obtained by complexation of the metal ions with citric acid, we gave preference to co-precipitation as oxalates. One of the reasons for doing so was associated with the capability of the oxalate anion to coordinate with different metals so as to create polymeric structures [64,65]. Mixed CoCu-oxalate polymers may be regarded as an example of an MOF (Metal Organic Framework) structure. The approach is conceptually different from that used by IFP because it considers the close proximity of both metals at the instant of oxalic co-precipitation. Thermal stripping of the CO2 from the oxalate ligand in a subsequent step then allows the formation of nano-sized mixed-metal CoCu particles. To produce active catalysts in alternative routes chosen by IFP, a solid state chemical reaction during calcination and roasting of the precursors between 400°C and 1000°C would become necessary and most probably entail unwanted side effects such as sintering or loss of active metal through inactive compound formation (by reaction with other metal oxides, for example). Indeed, several reports appeared in the literature in which doubts were casted over the reproducibility of the preparation conditions and performance stability of the IFP catalyst formulations [8,22]. Another attractive feature of the oxalate route of catalyst preparation is that a third metal may be included in the co-precipitation. This additional metal may eventually, but not necessarily, form an independent oxalate framework structure decomposing thermally so as to provide a metal oxide, rather than metal, which can act as a dispersant/support or promoter in close contact with the active CoCu bimetallic phase. This short critical review will highlight ternary systems such as “CoCuMn”, “CoCuMo” and “CoCuNb”. Specifically, we shall demonstrate our recent achievements in the design and synthesis of such catalysts as well as in the production of long-chain C8–C14 and short-chain C2–C5 alcohols respectively."
2,Binary cobalt–copper model catalysts: preparation and activation,"2.1 Binary cobalt–copper model catalysts: preparation and activation Bimetallic CoCu model catalysts prepared via the oxalate route were examined in detail for their preparation and performance [61]. From a general point of view, it is well known from thermodynamics that bulk cobalt–copper alloys do not exist. Both metals show low solubility (phase diagrams show a maximum of 9 at%) into each other. Since one of our hypotheses for why CoCu might be a good choice for terminal alcohol production was both metals to be as closely associated to each other as possible, we developed oxalate co-precipitation [66] in which oxalate ligands undergo double-chelation with both metals as indicated in Scheme 1. To produce active catalysts from such mixed-metal precursor, the oxalate ligand has to be thermally stripped off which may lead to either CO2 or CO: (1) MeC2O4 →Me + 2 CO2 (2) MeC2O4 →MeO+CO+CO2 According to Eqs. (1) and (2), either metal or metal oxide is formed depending on whether CO2 and/or CO are the gaseous products. The extent to which metal oxide forms depends on the chemical environment during the decomposition (of course, the reaction stoichiometry in Eq. (2) has to be adapted for metal oxide formation other than MeO). The decomposition may be conducted either in the presence of an inert gas (Ar) or in hydrogen and/or CO. In reducing atmospheres, a pure metallic phase may eventually be achieved depending on the nature of the metal (in ternary CoCuMn, for example, a complete reduction of Mn-oxides to metallic states is impossible). Fig. 1 provides an example for H2-assisted temperature-programmed decomposition (TPDec) of cobalt–copper mixed oxalates in comparison to pure cobalt and copper oxalates. Generally, the decomposition features occur at temperatures between 200°C and 400°C. However, while the Co2Cu1- and Co3Cu1-mixed oxalates (indices stand for atomic ratios of metals) decompose at ∼320°C, peaks of pure cobalt and copper oxalate are located at 370°C and 265°C. This observation clearly shows that the mixed-metal oxalate must be regarded a distinct phase with decomposition properties leading to an “association” rather than to completely phase-separated and independent states of the metals. Further characterization studies by electron spectroscopy and microscopy show that H2-assisted decomposition of cobalt–copper oxalate may result in the formation of core@shell structured CoCu particles. It is to be emphasized that a Co@Cu structure, in the case of oxalate mixed metal decomposition, is the result of a self-assembly which is different from Cu@Co with inversed structure as produced by some groups using wet-chemistry techniques, such as colloidal methods or galvanic replacement [67–72], and applied by Nafria et al. [72] in both CO and CO2 hydrogenation. A copper-rich shell in self-assembled Co@Cu catalysts has recently been identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) [61,63], and confirmed by DFT theoretical calculations [63]. Interestingly, such core@shell structure can be inversed when the oxalate precursor is being activated in the presence of CO. Obviously, CO adsorption can induce an anti-segregation of Cu and Co whereby Co is chemically “pumped” to the surface thereby exchanging for surface Cu. According to DFT [63], CO adsorption on Co in Co0.25Cu0.75/Co(0001) is markedly weaker than that on pure Co even though Co appears to be electronically unaffected by the presence of Cu, according to a density of states analysis. It has also been shown that the CO-covered anti-segregated surface is thermodynamically favored over that of a CO-covered fully segregated surface. If CO is present at high coverage, the surface can become enriched by 1.00 mL Co; the layer sequence of CoCu may therefore be anticipated to be completely inverted under CO hydrogenation conditions. While activation of cobalt–copper oxalate in H2 results in the formation of a clean metallic surface, the CO-assisted decomposition of the oxalate precursor produces cobalt particles encapsulated by an “onion-like” graphitic carbon shell whose precursor carbon probably originates from the Boudouard reaction (2CO+[]ad→ Cad +CO2). As shown in Fig. 2 , the shell thickness obtained from carbon association is ∼2–3nm. The layered structure suggests graphene-type sheets to pile up on to each other. Such graphitic carbon seems to be rather stable in H2 for temperatures up to about 500°C, but can be more easily oxidized to CO2 at around 350°C [61]. Since the F–T process involves net reducing conditions, we anticipate such a catalyst to retain its graphitic carbon shell during CO hydrogenation. Additionally, according to Fig. 2, encapsulated particles are associated with face centered cubic metallic Co or Cu; the indicated lattice spacing of ∼0.208nm can be attributed to the (111) plane. We note that graphene or graphitic carbon encapsulated catalysts with iron rather than Co or CoCu particles have recently been developed using various preparation methods [73–75]. Such encapsulated particles usually show high activity and long-chain products selectivity and it has been claimed that this performance is most probably associated with a confinement effect."
3,Binary cobalt–copper model catalysts: catalytic performance,"2.2 Binary cobalt–copper model catalysts: catalytic performance Graphitic carbon encapsulated CoCu catalysts have been shown to be much more active in CO hydrogenation than the CoCu metallic catalyst. As shown in Fig. 3 , the Co2Cu1 catalyst activated in CO (Co2Cu1[CO]) has a much higher CO hydrogenation activity than that activated in H2 (Co2Cu1[H2]). The CO conversion at steady-state is 27.1% for Co2Cu1[CO], while it is only 5.7% for Co2Cu1[H2]. However, in terms of the steady-state alcohols selectivity, the Co2Cu1[H2] catalyst (∼35 wt%) is higher than that of the Co2Cu1[CO] catalyst, ∼16 wt%. Additionally, Fig. 3 also shows that for both catalysts, the steady-state activity and selectivity are reached only after several hours’ time-on-stream. This run-in period, in terms of selectivities, seems to be longer for Co2Cu1[H2] (∼6h) than for Co2Cu1[CO] (∼2h). Therefore, it must be concluded that major textural and chemical restructuring of the catalyst is occurring during these early times of operation at elevated synthesis pressures. While significant chemical changes are associated with the initial transformation of the oxalate precursor into active catalyst at atmospheric pressures of H2 or CO, the high-pressure synthesis seems to cause further changes for thermodynamic (oxygenates production is strongly favored by increasing pressures) and kinetic reasons. It is to be stated, though, that the mechanistic and chemical details of this late restructuring are not known at present. Further research efforts will be necessary to improve our understanding in this regard. The ASF-plots of alcohols at steady-state after Co2Cu1 oxalate activation in H2 and CO, respectively, are also shown in Fig. 3. It is seen that strictly linear ASF-distributions are observed for alcohols over the entire C n range. The chain lengthening probabilities (α) are 0.3 and 0.48 for Co2Cu1[H2] and Co2Cu1[CO], respectively. A somewhat different behavior will be obtained by summing up all carbon-containing product species in Ctotal for each C n . When doing so, a linear ASF behavior is found for Co2Cu1[H2] with α-values of 0.41 for the entire C n range while such linearity with α =0.68 is found for Co2Cu1[CO] only if the C1 contribution is discarded [61]. In fact, inspecting the ASF behavior for hydrocarbons formation (including paraffins and olefins) a large positive deviation is seen for methane. On the other hand, the C2 hydrocarbons (ethane and ethylene) remain below ASF expectations. Exceeding methane production is most probably a consequence of massive CO dissociation during the activation process followed by stepwise hydrogen reaction. More detailed catalytic performance data for CoCu catalysts from our group, as well as from the literature, are also compiled in Table 1 . It is seen from our studies that the catalytic activity (CO conversion) and chain-lengthening probability increase with rising Co relative amounts. The selectivities for alcohols, alkanes and alkenes formation remain almost unchanged for catalysts with a Co/Cu ratio of 1/2, 1/1 and 2/1. A further increase of the Co/Cu ratio to 4/1 results in a decrease of alcohols selectivity and correlates with an increase of alkanes and alkenes selectivities. All catalysts produce alcohols with a selectivity significantly higher than 30%. The ASF chain lengthening probability of CoCu continuously increases with rising Co amounts, but remains within the range of values representative for a chain lengthening up to about C5. The combined alcohols/alkenes selectivity reaches nearly 50%. Note that both alcohols and alkenes appear with terminal functionality; branched isomers are never detected in more than trace amounts. The CO2 selectivity over all CoCu catalysts is below 3 wt%. Increasing the Co relative amounts results in a slightly decreasing CO2 production, which is in accordance with the fact that Co is less active than Cu in the water gas shift reaction. Similar to our study, Xiao et al. [76] activated their Co3Cu1 model catalyst in syngas and obtained very similar results to ours for Co2Cu1[CO]. Quite different from our method of oxalate co-precipitation, the Spivey group prepared bimetallic CoCu nanoparticles using SB-12 as surfactant in the liquid phase, and the catalysts were also studied for their suitability in higher alcohols synthesis [49]. As compiled in Table 1, they reported on the catalytic performance of Co@Cu core-shell as well as CoCu mixed nanoparticle structures in the absence of a support. Different from our study with only terminal alcohols production over CoCu catalysts, it seems from their study that various oxygenates (both linear and iso) such as alcohols, aldehydes and ketones, were produced along with large amounts of CO2. Additionally, the production of long-chain C4+ alcohols was not reported in their study."
4,Ternary cobalt–copper–manganese catalysts: structural properties and catalytic performance,"2.3 Ternary cobalt–copper–manganese catalysts: structural properties and catalytic performance While CoCu catalysts in the absence of a generic support may have remarkable selectivities to terminal alcohol production in CO hydrogenation (see Table 1 in paragraph 2.2), their activity and overall stability are usually not sufficient with regard to the possibility of a large-scale industrial implementation. We therefore undertook to increase the activity and provide long-term stability of the catalytic performance by including a third metal in the oxalate co-precipitation. Several metals were tested for this purpose and their choice was guided by the need to (i) increase the specific surface area (the BET area of Co1Cu1 is ∼10 m2 /g) and (ii) boost the alcohol selectivity for slates with specific chain lengthening characteristics. With regard to (i), we opted for Mn in the first place anticipating that the thermal decomposition of the Co-Cu-Mn co-precipitated oxalate framework would lead to metallic and metal oxide phases and therefore to higher BET areas as compared to CoCu. Furthermore, while bimetallic Co and Cu show low solubility into each other [77] the addition of Mn can reduce the large Co–Cu miscibility gap [78]. As mentioned previously, an intimate mixing of the metals is being considered key to improving the catalytic performance. Of course, with regard to (ii), the occurrence of an oxide phase in activated catalysts is usually regarded essential for enhancing terminal alcohol formation. Ternary “CoCuMn” catalysts prepared according to the oxalate route indeed demonstrated high performance in terminal alcohol formation. In particular, long-chain alcohols optimizing the C8 to C14 slate were produced with high selectivity over these catalysts [59]. The reported selectivity to combined terminal alcohols/olefins was usually higher than 60 wt% and occasionally rose up to 95 wt%. The ASF chain-lengthening probabilities for alcohols were higher than 0.6, but usually below 0.9, and allowed optimizing the C8–C14 slate as feedstock for plasticizers, lubricants or detergents. Before discussing the catalytic performance in more detail, we summarize the structural and chemical characteristics of a catalyst with nominal Co1Cu1Mn1 composition. Quite different from CoCu mixed oxalates which decompose thermally into a metallic phase with core@shell structure, Mn oxalate, either pure or as part of an oxalate polymer framework, turns into Mn5O8 during H2-assisted TPDec. Fig. 4 clearly identifies this mixed-valence oxide structure, Mn2 2+Mn3 4 +O8, which is best described as consisting of anionic [Mn3 4+O8]4 − planar sheets separated by Mn2 + cation layers. Mn5O8 most likely acts as a dispersant and promoter (see the activity/selectivity data below) in close contact with a metallic phase containing Co, Cu, Mn and their aggregates. The BET specific surface area is ∼170 m2/g for Co1Cu1Mn1 which is much larger than that of Co1Cu1. Besides the presence of an Mn5O8 oxidic phase, a metallic phase with all three metals being present in the same particles is also formed during H2-TPDec of the Co1Cu1Mn1 oxalate framework. This is shown in Fig. 5 which presents atom maps recorded from a single CoCuMn metallic grain using Atom Probe Tomography (APT) [59]. For these experiments a passivated sample of the catalyst was conditioned to form a nano-sized tip which was subjected to laser-assisted field evaporation. The image provided here is a section through a 3D tomographic reconstruction so as to reveal the intragranular structure of the nanoparticles. The results provide a striking demonstration of the core-shell chemical structure, with major amounts of Co forming the core, and all three elements being clearly present in an otherwise Cu-dominated outer shell of about 2nm thickness. Our synthesis also stimulates the formation of very small nano-sized CoCuMn precipitates, which occur inside the core structure. Furthermore, only small amounts of oxygen are detected. We therefore conclude that the “CoCuMn” phase formed during decomposition of the oxalate framework is largely metallic. We now turn to the detailed catalytic performance of Co1Cu1Mn1 catalysts. For comparison purposes, we also refer to bimetallic catalysts both in the absence and presence of an MnO x -support (whereby MnO x refers to Mn5O8 formed in a separate rather than simultaneous oxalate precipitation step; the occurrence of other Mn-oxide phases cannot be excluded here). Fig. 6 summarizes the activity, selectivity and α-ASF chain-lengthening probability for Co1Cu1, Co1Cu1Mn1 and Co1Cu1/MnO x . It is obvious that all three catalysts are active in terminal alcohol and olefin production. While the ROH selectivity (S ROH) increases with decreasing reaction temperatures for Co1Cu1Mn1, it runs through a broad maximum at ∼250°C for Co1Cu1 and at ∼220°C for Co1Cu1/MnO x. S ROH values of close to 60% at otherwise low CO conversion are obtained for Co1Cu1Mn1 at 190°C, while for Co1Cu1 and Co1Cu1/MnO x the maximum S ROH values are ∼30% and ∼40%, respectively. It is also obvious from Fig. 6 that the enhanced 1-alcohol selectivity entails a respective decrease in the n-alkane (S RH) and 1-alkene (S R=) selectivity for Co1Cu1Mn1. This trade-off between S ROH and (S RH + S R=) is not observed for Co1Cu1 and Co1Cu1/MnO x . The selectivity for alcohol production of the ternary Co1Cu1Mn1 catalyst prepared through oxalate co-precipitation therefore outperforms that of the bimetallic ones. CO2 production is unwanted but frequently reported to be difficult to control [34]. CoCu catalysts, quite differently, usually produce less CO2 than other catalysts such as CuZn-, Mo2S- and FeCu-based catalysts. As shown in Fig. 6, the CO2 selectivity (S CO2) is quite low for Co1Cu1Mn1 and Co1Cu1/MnO x over a range of temperatures. Under conditions of increasing CO conversion, an enhanced CO2 production is frequently related to the occurrence of the water–gas shift reaction, CO+H2O→CO2 +H2, which may be beneficial if feeds with higher than nominal H2/CO ratios are required. The most intriguing observation for Co1Cu1Mn1 catalysts is the high α-ASF chain-lengthening probability for 1-alcohols production. The α-values range from 0.6 to above 0.8 for temperatures between 250°C and 190°C and therefore achieve the purpose of maximizing the yields of C8–C14 terminal alcohols. However, the Co1Cu1 and Co1Cu1/MnO x catalysts fail to produce the envisaged C8–C14 slate of terminal alcohols. Instead, Co1Cu1 shows a chain-lengthening probability of 0.31 suitable for short-chain alcohol production up to about C6, which is what the literature reports for either supported or unsupported CoCu catalysts [16–19,21,22,49,50,79–81]. The Co1Cu1Mn1 results are encouraging with respect to a possible industrial application. Therefore, a detailed study of the catalytic performance of this ternary system has been performed by changing the relative amounts of Mn in “CoCuMn” from 1 to 0.1 for both Co1Cu1 and Co1Cu4 [59]. As shown in Fig. 7 , all catalysts are selective in 1-alcohol/1-alkene production at low temperatures while they are more selective in n-alkane production at higher temperatures. The highest S ROH value is observed for Co1Cu4Mn0.1 under conditions of low CO conversion. Actually, the sum of S ROH and S R= for this catalyst is above 95%, with negligible CO2 formation. This selectivity pattern is close to ideal; however, the catalyst activity is insufficient. A good compromise between activity and ROH/R= selectivities is presently only obtainable at medium temperatures around 240°C. The Co1Cu1Mn1 catalyst still performs best at this point in time and appears to be a suitable candidate for further optimization. Another interesting result for CoCuMn catalysts is related with the time-on-stream (TOS) behavior. As shown in Fig. 8 , a very long induction period up to 10h is observed for the products selectivity. The alcohols selectivity is ∼13 wt% at the very beginning but increases to ∼27 wt% after 1h of TOS and keeps nearly constant for 6h TOS before further increasing to ∼40 wt% after 11h TOS which corresponds to the steady-state level. It is remarkable that the steady state performance suffers from no deterioration even after 80h TOS indicating a very good stability of the Co1Cu1Mn1 catalyst. The long induction period to steady-state behavior suggests the occurrence of major reconstruction of the catalyst under the reaction conditions. Another important result indicating catalyst reconstruction is related with the ASF distribution behavior of “total carbon” at different TOS. As shown in Fig. 8, a linear ASF behavior is obtained only after 4h TOS. With TOS below 4h, the long-chain C6 + products show a high (negative) deviation from the linear ASF distribution; the deviation decreases with increasing TOS and finally vanishes after 6h. Similar to our study, more recently Zhang et al. [55] and Pei et al. [82] also envisaged CoCuMn catalysts for higher alcohols synthesis. While Zhang et al. studied the effect of surfactant (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and pluronic P123 triblock copolymer (EO20PO70EO20)) on CuCoMn catalysts for higher alcohol synthesis Pei et al. prepared CoCuMn catalysts using activated carbon as the support through incipient wetness impregnation. For both studies, the highest alcohols selectivity claimed by the authors is around 40%, with relatively lower chain-lengthening probability when surfactants are used in the preparation."
5,Ternary cobalt–copper–molybdenum catalyst,"2.4 Ternary cobalt–copper–molybdenum catalyst The preparation of ternary CoCuMo catalysts using the oxalate route is quite different from that of CoCuMn and CoCu catalysts. As neither cationic nor anionic Mo species can be precipitated as oxalates, a different strategy had to be developed for the preparation of CoCuMo with varying relative composition. Accordingly, while Co and Cu were precipitated as oxalates, ammonium was entrained as either MoO3 or (NH4)6Mo7O24 . 4H2O due to its insolubility in 2-propanol solvent as used for oxalate precipitation. The presence of Mo in CoCu catalyst, similar with CoCuMn, causes a dispersion effect; the BET surface area for Co1Cu1Mo1 being ∼185m2/g. The catalytic performance of CoCuMo catalysts in terms of activity, selectivity and α-ASF chain-lengthening probability is shown in Fig. 9 . It is obvious that all catalysts are active in 1-alcohol (ROH) production. While the ROH selectivity (S ROH) increases with decreasing reaction temperatures, S ROH values above 60% are obtained for Co1Cu1Mo1 at 170°C. From the viewpoint of alcohols formation, Co1Cu5Mo1 probably shows the most intriguing pattern. At a reaction temperature of 200°C nearly 95% of the products appear as 1-alcohols. Unfortunately, the CO conversion is low under these conditions and reaches values of about 7%. Additionally, for Co1Cu5Mo1 the αROH chain-lengthening probability for the C1–C7 range is close to 0.2, which means that methanol formation is dominating under these conditions. Thus, this catalyst formulation is neither very suitable for the production of short-chain alcohols as a substitute for gasoline fuel nor for that of long-chain alcohols as a feedstock for plasticizers, surfactants or lubricants. For low-temperature conditions and small CO conversion, Co1Cu1Mo1 produces, almost exclusively, 1-alcohols and CO2 and it may thus be argued that this selectivity pattern is due to the mechanistic effects of the FT reaction, rather than to the water–gas shift reaction. The most remarkable observation with CoCuMo catalyst is the α-ASF behavior for terminal alcohols. As shown in Fig. 10 , Co1Cu1Mo1 shows a double-ASF distribution in the same figure with α 1 = 0.28 for C1–C7 alcohols and α 2 = 0.88 for C7 + alcohols. In fact, this particular behavior holds for the entire range of investigated temperatures. According to Fig. 9, α-values above 0.9 for C7 + are more of the rule than the exception. As for the C1–C7 range of 1-alcohol production, we point out that the α-values of Co1Cu1 and Co1Cu1Mo1 are very similar. It may be inferred that similar catalytic sites are responsible for the formation of this range of alcohols in both types of catalysts. We also note that double-ASF distributions, as reported here for Co1Cu1Mo1, are not unusual in F–T research. They were observed in studies with Fe-based catalysts [83–85] and attributed to the coexistence of two different types of active sites. The same Co–Cu–Mo catalyst system promoted with K has been recently studied by Prieto et al. [24]. Based on DFT calculations, they developed a CoCuMo catalyst from a molybdate precursor compound whose crystalline structure isomorphically accommodates Cu2+ and Co2 + cations in a wide range of compositions. Based on Scanning Electron Microscopy evidence coupled to energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), the authors claimed a uniform distribution of Co and Cu within the molybdate compounds, which provides superior mixing of Co and Cu. From their results, the total alcohol selectivity (not including CO2) was ∼47% C at otherwise < 2% CO conversion. Different from our “CoCuMo” catalysts, but similar to IFP studies in the 1970s, K-CoCu/MoO x , seemed to produce mainly ethanol and short-chain alcohols."
6,Ternary cobalt–copper–niobium catalyst,"2.5 Ternary cobalt–copper–niobium catalyst Previous F–T research with Co/Nb2O5 catalysts demonstrated a good selectivity to long-chain products [86–89]. The occurrence of Strong Metal Support Interaction (SMSI) was reported important in these studies. With this background, we developed a new type of “CoCuNb” catalyst via oxalate precursors which, after hydrogen-assisted activation and in the absence of a generic support material, turned out to produce primary alcohols (and olefins) with high selectivity [62]. Such CoCuNb catalysts were found to contain an Nb-oxide phase conditioned as nanoparticles acting as a dispersant for (larger) Co–Cu metallic particles. We start reviewing our previous work on the structural and chemical characterization of such catalysts before presenting their catalytic performance both from earlier and very recent so far unpublished results. Fig. 11 (a) shows results from X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS) for the Nb 3d binding energy range. Nb4 + and Nb5 + oxidation states are both detected in variable amounts for two representative samples of Co1Cu1Nb1 and Co1Cu1Nb0.4. The 3d peak deconvolution clearly shows the relative portion of Nb4 + to increase when lowering the Nb nominal amount in “CoCuNb x ”. According to the classical SMSI concepts developed by Tauster et al. [90], the occurrence of reduced oxidation states in metal oxides with variable stoichiometry is mandatory to provoke SMSI behavior. An electron transfer from reduced surface cations, Nb4 + in our case, to the metallic phase (CoCu here) was invoked, possibly leading to the formation of a Schottky barrier at the metal-oxide/metal interface. For Co/Nb2O5 catalysts in which Nb2O5 was used as a generic support material the group of Schmal reported NbO2 to form under reducing conditions [91]. Another interesting observation from XPS studies is associated with the significant changes in the surface composition when Nb was added to CoCu. As shown in Fig. 11(b), while the surface abundance of Cu largely exceeds its bulk value in Co2Cu1 the reverse is true for CoCuNb: both, Co1Cu1Nb0.4 and Co1Cu1Nb1 formulations show a large suppression in the Cu surface abundance. Instead, a pronounced excess of Nb is observed. Therefore, it might be concluded that the Co@Cu core-shell structure as present in CoCu binary [61] and CoCuMn ternary [59] formulations are not maintained in “CoCuNbO x ”. The XRD patterns (Fig. 11c and d) for “CoCuNb” show diffraction of fcc Cu (JCPDS#04-0836) at 43.3°, 50.3° and 74.1° suggesting the bulk of such samples contains extended regions of crystalline Cu. This is different from Co2Cu1, where nearly no Cu diffraction is observed. Instead, new diffraction lines at 44°, 51.1°, and 75.5° (Co or CoCu) appear. This would be in accordance with the occurrence of Co@Cu core-shell structures in which Cu occurs in thin nanometer-sized layers at the surface of the particles and therefore contributes little to bulk diffraction. This view is in line with the XPS results. The diffraction of Nb-related species is absent, which is probably due to the formation of amorphous Nb-oxides, or such oxidic phases associated with nanosized structures on the particle surface. The (HR)TEM images of Co2Cu1Nb0.2 catalyst shown in Fig. 12 clearly demonstrate the occurrence of a bimodal particle size distribution. The size of the larger CoCu particles is in the range of 25–40nm, peaking at 30–35nm and thus covering the average size of 34nm as determined from measurements of the specific surface area S BET for binary Co2Cu1. Quite differently, the minority component, Nb, shows up in particles with smaller size ranging from 4 to 8nm. The TEM images suggest these particles to act as “spacer” specimen enfolding the larger CoCu particles and thus conferring “CoCuNb” catalysts a considerable increase in the specific surface area, S BET. By way of example, S BET increases from 20.4 to 49.6 m2/g by adding Nb0.2 to Co2Cu1. S BET values larger than 110 m2/g are observed for Co2Cu1Nb≥ 0.6 and Co2Nb1. Additionally, the HRTEM shown in Fig. 12(c) and (d) suggest an intimate contact between metal and NbO x . A lattice spacing of ∼0.205nm, attributed to the (111) plane of face-centered cubic (fcc) Co can be identified in close proximity to NbO x “spacer” particles. On the other hand, hexagonal close-packed (hcp) Co can be unequivocally identified (Fig. 12d). The comparative study of the catalytic performance of “CoCuNb” and “CoCu” catalysts demonstrates the promotion effect of Nb in terms of both activity and alcohols selectivity. Fig. 13 provides the catalytic results for Co2Cu1, Co2Cu1Nb0.2, Co2Cu1Nb0.6 and Co2Cu1Nb1 catalysts at 220°C. It is clearly seen that the ternary Co2Cu1Nb x catalysts show higher activity and alcohols selectivity than the binary Co2Cu1 catalyst, proving the presence of Nb promotes the formation of alcohols. The alcohols selectivity is ∼45 wt% for Co2Cu1Nb x , independent of the Nb content. The alkenes selectivity increases with increasing Nb content which correlates with the decreasing alkanes’ selectivity. However, the activity of the catalysts decreases significantly with higher Nb contents in Co2Cu1Nb x . According to Fig. 13, the Co2Cu1Nb0.2 formulation seems to perform somewhat better than the other catalysts. To identify the optimum relative amounts of Co and Cu in catalysts with low Nb content we investigated Co x Cu y Nb0.2 ternary systems with x/y ratios ranging from 2/1 to 1/8. As shown in Fig. 14 , high alcohol selectivities S ROH up to 55 wt% are observed for temperatures between 180°C and 240°C. A further increase of the temperature beyond this range causes a sharp drop in S ROH. The combined 1-alcohol/1-olefin maximum selectivity reaches ∼73 wt% at about 200°C; however, the CO conversion remains below 10%. Increasing the Co/Cu ratio from 1/8 to 2/1 results in a continuous increase of the conversion but eventually causes a decrease in the terminal alcohol selectivity for Co/Cu (x/y) ratios exceeding 1/2. The best catalyst in terms of alcohols formation turns out to be Co1Cu2Nb0.2, which provides S ROH values between 43 wt% and 49 wt% at CO conversions ranging from 12 to 21%. It must be noted that changing the Co/Cu ratios in “CoCuNb” catalysts has almost no effect on the α-ASF chain-lengthening probability of alcohols. A typical α-value (range from 0.2 to ∼0.4) is being observed for all the catalysts measured at different conditions. The detailed products distribution obtained for Co2Cu1Nb0.2 at 220°C suggests the formation of mainly short-chain C2–C5 1-alcohols."
7,Discussions,
8,Comparison of different catalysts for higher alcohols synthesis,"3.1 Comparison of different catalysts for higher alcohols synthesis The catalytic results for “CoCuMn”, “CoCuMo” and “CoCuNb” ternary catalysts demonstrated good performance in higher alcohols synthesis through CO hydrogenation. Further comparison of these catalysts with other catalytic systems such as FeCu-, MoS2-, Mo2C- and Rh-based catalysts are compiled in Table 2 . Generally, CoCu-based catalysts (“CoCuMn” and “CoCuMo”) show higher chain-lengthening probability than all other catalysts, which allows us to tune the selectivity toward long-chain C8–C14 alcohols used as feedstock for plasticizers, lubricants and detergents. The “CoCuNb” formulation, however, provides a chain lengthening probability of ∼0.3, which is slightly lower than that for CuFe-based catalysts reported in the literature. Such α-values optimize the C2–C5 slate of alcohols for fuel additive applications. The CO2 production over CoCu-based catalysts is quite low whereas for CuFe- and Mo-based catalysts (including “CoCuMo”) it is relatively higher. The total alcohols selectivity on CoCu-based catalysts is usually higher than 40 wt%; if alkenes are included values of more than 60% are reached for functionalized products. Further comparison of the catalytic performance among various catalyst systems is difficult since significantly different reaction conditions are usually applied. However, we anticipate that CoCu based catalysts would be much more cost-effective than Rh. Furthermore, with respect to the catalytic performance (activity and selectivity) they seem to outperform Mo-based and FeCu-based catalysts, which makes them potential candidates for a scale-up in an industrial application."
9,Active phase composition,"3.2 Active phase composition While there is no doubt that Co@Cu core shell systems form from CoCu-mixed oxalate precursors during thermal activation in the presence of hydrogen, there is no experimental proof at present that such systems provide the active phase under harsh conditions of CO hydrogenation. Actually, there are indications that phase separation takes place in CoCu bimetallic catalysts, however, the immediate proximity of both metals in the oxalate precursor seems to have a positive effect on the active phase formation and the resulting catalytic performance. The same arguments hold for “CoCuMn” catalysts, as discussed on the basis of Fig. 6. While for a Co1Cu1Mn1 catalyst we identified a core-shell chemical structure of the nano-sized metal particles, with major amounts of Co forming the core, and all three elements available in an otherwise Cu-dominated outer shell of about 2nm thickness, we have not yet been able to detect such core-shell structures after CO hydrogenation. We suspect that during reaction deep reconstruction takes place so as to form a catalytically active phase susceptible for long-chain alcohols synthesis. Furthermore, with regard to ternary CoCuMn, an oxidic phase of Mn was identified as consisting of Mn5O8 with mixed valences of Mn (+2 and +4); this phase was shown to be in close contact with metallic Co and Cu and resulted in a dispersion and promotion effect to enhance the overall activity and selectivity in alcohol formation. For “CoCuNb” catalysts, besides metallic CoCu after activation, both Nb2O5 and NbO2 (valence states +5 and +4) seemed to be present according to surface characterization by XPS. Additionally, a bimodal particle size distribution was observed, where larger (20–40nm) CoCu particles were separated from each other by small (4–8nm) NbO x particles. Thus, similar to the Mn case, metal/metal-oxide interfaces seem to play an important role, possibly involving SMSI (Strong Metal Support Interaction) effects. Notwithstanding, an atomistic model of the catalytically active surface phases for ternary “CoCuMn” and “CoCuNb” is still to be developed and will need the use of high-resolution operando characterization techniques."
10,Mechanistic aspects,"3.3 Mechanistic aspects The chain lengthening mechanism leading to F–T products has been a topic of debate ever since the discovery of the reaction. Even hundred years after the discovery of the reaction at BASF (Badische Anilin and Soda Fabrik) it is obvious that a generally accepted mechanism does not exist. To review the various suggestions would be out of the scope of the present paper. Quite generally, however, while some of these suggestions invoke a common mechanism for hydrocarbon and oxygenate formation, others claim different mechanisms apply. It also seems that oxygenates and, in particular, alcohols are thought to be formed via a CO insertion mechanism whereby the target bond of the “insertion” is still under discussion. A further complication is that the mechanism depends on the nature of the catalysts. For example, Mo- carbides or sulfides, Rh- and CuZn-based catalysts, do not operate according to F–T type chain-lengthening mechanisms while CoCu- and FeCu-based catalysts do. This is also directly reflected in the ASF (Anderson-Schulz-Flory) behavior, which clearly shows straight long-chain product formation is possible using CoCu-based catalysts (“CoCuMn”, “CoCuMo”, Table 2). Turning to bimetallic CoCu and ternary “CoCuNb” catalysts, see Table 3 , the α values for paraffins (C2 +), olefins (C3 +), and alcohols (C2 +) are found to systematically increase in the order α alcohols < α alkenes < α alkanes [62]. This is different for “Co1Cu1Mn1” where all products were formed with nearly identical chain lengthening probability [59]. While this would be in accordance with a common growth mechanism, leading to a “kinetic branching” with a different termination step, it must be emphasized that a microscopic mechanism for the F–T reaction cannot be derived from the ASF behavior. We finish our excursion into mechanistic pathways by making a few comments on the “formate” type mechanism previously suggested by our group on the basis of quantitative Chemical Transient Kinetics (CTK) experiments with Co- and Ni- based catalysts [94,95] as well as CoCu bimetallics [96]. The CTK results obtained with all these catalysts have in common that (i) catalyst surfaces are “crowded”, i.e. surface coverages with carbon, oxygen and hydrogen exceed the monolayer limit under steady-state conditions, (ii) water formation occurs delayed with respect to methane formation, (iii) hydrocarbon chain lengthening is time-correlated with the appearance of gaseous CO (the entire CO is being irreversibly chemisorbed during the first seconds after abruptly triggering the CO hydrogenation) and (iv) back-transients (reactor emptying) shows CO and argon to be removed with nearly the same time constant while chain-lengthened products have a unique and much longer time constant. Findings (iii) and (iv) are clearly indicative of a CO insertion mechanism to occur. This is also supported by ASF-plots in which the chain lengthening probability, once it occurs, is directly proportional to the CO pressure in the reactor. Since the catalyst surface is saturated with adsorbed species (argument i), an insertion into a Me–C (or Me–H) bond appears unlikely. On the other hand, since during the very initial stages of the CTK experiment CO molecules are being dissociated without immediate water formation (by reaction with hydrogen) we anticipate that surface hydroxyl is being formed and acting as the target of the insertion process. This will lead to the formation of surface (bidentate) formate or formate-derived species as indicated in Scheme 2 . It should be noted that such formates were clearly identified in DRIFTS measurements of the CO hydrogenation with Co-based catalysts [97]. Hydrogenation of μ1-formates may then lead to surface alkoxys which either get further hydrogenated to produce alcohols or suffer another CO insertion into the O–C bond to progress in chain growth. Of course, hydrogenation of alkoxy intermediates would also allow production of both saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons. Scheme 2 summarizes the various possibilities. It is clear that the suggested mechanism has not been proven in every detail; however, it is compatible with the entire set of CTK observations. Any mechanistic considerations beyond those made above must await further operando-type measurements."
11,Conclusion and perspectives,"This review provided an overview of our research achievements over the past years with regard to “higher” alcohol production by catalytic syngas reaction over CoCu-based catalysts. Several ternary catalyst formulations such as “CoCuMn”, “CoCuMo” and “CoCuNb” were investigated and compared to each other with regard to their structure–performance relationship. Different from more classical recipes of catalyst preparation, these ternary formulations were designed using oxalate-precipitated MOF-type precursors in the absence of a generic support material. After activation, which generally consisted in stripping off CO and CO2 from the chelating oxalate ligand during temperature-programmed heating of the polymeric MOF precursor, metallic phases in close contact with a dispersing metal oxide (Mn5O8 in the case of “CoCuMn”) were found to form. Metallic phases in activated catalysts contained also core@shell type structures (Co@Cu, in particular). Future structural characterization studies will have to address the question of the relevance of such core@shell structures during catalytic reaction conditions. We have not succeeded so far to demonstrate that interface structures in Co@Cu/Mn5O8 are really responsible for the catalytic performance of “CoCuMn”. While Mn5O8 with mixed valences of Mn (+2 and +4) was clearly identified in CoCuMn, both Nb2O5 and NbO2 (valence states +5 and +4) seem to be present in “CoCuNb”. Similar to the Mn case, such NbO x plays the role of a “promoting dispersant”. Electron microscopy studies revealed nanoparticles of NbO x to act as spacers for keeping the larger CoCu particles separate from each other. While “CoCuNb” catalysts most likely develop SMSI behavior we have not yet succeeded in revealing how such effects influence the catalytic performance. It is most remarkable, though, that the relative metal amounts in “CoCuNb” and CoCuMn” can be adjusted so as to optimize the C2–C5 slate or, respectively, the C8–C14 slate of higher alcohols. Other oxygenates, such as aldehydes, were observed in insignificant amounts over CoCu-based catalysts; carboxylic acids and ketones were not seen at all. Our more recent studies with CoMn-based catalysts showed, however, that n-aldehydes can be formed besides alcohols if the CO/H2 partial pressures are suitably chosen [98]. Both “CoCuNb” and CoCuMn” catalysts have a remarkable long-term stability in CO hydrogenation which is a prerequisite for considering them as candidates in large scale industrial applications as fuels (additives) or feedstock for lubricants, detergents or plasticizers. There is no doubt, however, that any further progress in designing suitable catalyst formulations for either type of catalyst will be measured against the possibility of reducing the tradeoff between selectivity to alcohols formation and catalytic CO conversion (activity) in reaction temperature variation measurements. For thermodynamic reasons, high alcohol yields can only be expected at low temperatures. So, if we succeed in increasing the catalyst activity under these conditions, an industrial utilization may come into reach. We recall that long-chain alcohols are presently synthesized in a homogeneous two-step process by hydroformylation of a target olefin first and conversion of the resulting aldehyde into alcohol subsequently. The terminal functionalization to form n-alcohols in this process is limited, however (Markovnikov rule). Using the heterogeneous “one pot” F–T technology may have advantages in this respect since strictly terminal oxygenates are formed as a result of a polymerization-type growth process of the hydrocarbon scaffold on the surface of the catalysts. Conversely, this growth is dictated by the ASF distribution and common unit operations of chemical engineering would be necessary to sorting C n products with unique n. A more detailed discussion of the pros and cons of “heterogeneous hydroformylation” must await a more rigorous economic efficiency analysis."
