0,Introduction,"The 1970s energy crisis has created much doubt and uncertainty in a world that could depend on the cheap and unbounded supply of fossil fuels. Therefore, finding a more sustainable resource that could replace traditional energy sources has drawn considerable attention and effort among the global scientific community [1,2]. Among the renewable energy sources, biomass-based energy is considered carbon neutral as the amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere during combustion is equal to the same amount captured through photosynthesis over the lifetime of the plant [3]. Biomass has an integral role in the current and future energy to meet the growing global energy demand and achieve sustainable energy development goals. Biomass-based energy is cleaner and more sustainable alternatives to those generated from fossil fuels [4,5]. Due to this result, biomass utilization for biofuel synthesis and production has been one of the top interests in recent years. Thermochemical conversion is the most feasible technique to convert biomass into biofuel, which is divided into combustion, torrefaction, pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction, and gasification [6,7]. The main goal of thermochemical conversion is to eliminate undesirable by-products by optimizing process parameters. Pyrolysis is a promising technique to convert biomass into biofuel at high temperatures (250−600 °C) in an inert condition. Indeed, the application of pyrolysis technology to the production of bio-based fuels and chemicals from biomass is an emerging approach [8]. The products of biomass pyrolysis are divided into bio-oil, biochar, and syngas, which could be employed for energy generation sources or other applications with outstanding attributes such as friendly environment, low costs, and biodegradation [9]. Numerous studies have focused on the pyrolysis behavior and characterization of lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis related to the product distribution, reactions, and modeling process at an industrial scale [10]. However, the composition, yield, and quality of products depend upon the operating parameters of the pyrolysis process (e.g., temperature, heating rate, and catalyst type) and biomass feedstocks. By changing these conditions, the composition and properties of the compounds formed during the pyrolysis process could be affected [11,12]. Pyrolysis is becoming increasingly important in today’s energy industry due to the number of high-value products yielded from the process. A number of articles on the pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass have been published during the previous decade, each based on a different set of parameters. For example, Zhang et al. [13] reviewed the composition and physicochemical properties of bio-oil from biomass fast pyrolysis liquefaction. They have outlined the issues that need to be resolved in order to improve the process. Isahak et al. [14] published an updated study on biomass thermal conversion for bio-oil conversion, focusing on feedstock characterization, reactor construction, product formation, and upgrading. Kan et al. [15] investigated the parameters and pretreatment processes that affect biomass pyrolysis. Guedes et al. [16] investigated the effect of pyrolysis process parameters such as temperature, reaction time, heating rate, gas flow rate, feed rate, particle size, and biomass composition on bio-oil yield and quality. Hu and Gholizadeh [17] reviewed various pyrolysis processes, focusing on the impact of key parameters, process configuration, reactors, and catalysts on the pyrolysis process. Furthermore, the state-of-the-art of pyrolysis technology commercialization, as well as the remaining problems in the commercialization phase, were reviewed. Over the last decade, researchers have also concentrated on developing an energy-efficient pyrolysis method by optimizing pyrolysis parameters for high-quality biofuel output. Sharma et al. [18], for example, critically reviewed the then current state of statistical modelling studies in biomass pyrolysis in order to recognize information gaps for future study. Kaczor et al. [19] include a review of works on mathematical modelling of the biomass pyrolysis mechanism, including model types, number of dimensions, observed phenomena, reactor style and dimensions, and model validation methods. Table 1 summarizes the novelty of current in relation to already published articles. To clarify further, the present study is intended to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date technical review on the effects of pyrolysis operating conditions (e.g., temperature, heating rate, pressure, particle size, biomass feedstock, reactor type, etc.) on the product yield and quality. Following that, a brief discussion of the pyrolysis product and various upgrading methods is provided. Finally, the economic assessment and technical orientation for the development of biomass pyrolysis are presented as well."
1,Pyrolysis reaction and process,"Pyrolysis consists of an endothermic reaction in which the decomposition of organic matter occurs at elevated temperatures in the absence of oxygen. The reactor temperatures typically vary between 250 and 600°C, which depend on the composition of the biomass feedstock and the desired outputs distribution (i.e., proportion of solid, liquid, and gaseous products). According to Neves et al. [20], when subjected to the pyrolysis process, the polymer structure and compositions (i.e. cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) of biomass materials start to break down as heat is introduced to the reactor, as presented in Fig. 1 . Pyrolysis is in the leading phase compared to other processes such as gasification and combustion that is followed by secondary gas-phase cracking and/or oxidation reactions to generate gaseous products. Generally, pyrolysis can be broadly classified as conventional (slow) and fast based on the heating rate only. Thus, for slow pyrolysis: t heating >> t r and for fast pyrolysis: t heating << t r where t heating: the time required to heat the fuel to the pyrolysis temperature and t r : characteristic pyrolysis reaction time (t r) [21]. A broader classification is presented in Table 2 based on the operating conditions such as temperature, heating rate, and residence time. Changing these parameters can alter the product distribution in the pyrolysis process, which is often performed at atmospheric or slightly elevated pressure. Thus, pyrolysis is divided into slow, intermediate, fast, ultra-fast, or flash pyrolysis, categorized by the differences in temperature, heating rate, residence time, and final products, as presented in Table 2. Torrefaction is a form of mild pyrolysis that is used to produce carbon-rich solid fuels from biomass [21,22]. Typically, the process occurs in an inert gas environment; however, the vacuum [34] or hydropyrolysis method, which creates a pressurized hydrogen atmosphere [35], is occasionally observed in practice. Pyrolysis can include a primary and a secondary reaction. In primary pyrolysis (typically between 250 and 500 °C), the thermal-induced breaking of the chemical bonds in the organic raw materials molecules results in both condensable and non-condensable gases. Secondary pyrolysis includes processes such as cracking, polymerization, dehydration, condensation, charring, among others. Elsewhere among the current literature, studies provide an additional review on the reaction chemistry of pyrolysis [36,37]. Besides temperature and heating rate, feedstock particle size is another important criterion that can influence the pyrolysis process. Smaller particles are required to maximize liquid products during fast pyrolysis. In contrast, intermediate pyrolysis does not have an upper limit requirement on particle sizes allowing for more diverse selections of biomass feedstock [38]. Furthermore, the liquid outputs from the intermediate pyrolysis process have demonstrated a significant improvement in terms of their properties that are similar to conventional diesel and biodiesel [39,40]. Slow pyrolysis is a conventional method characterized by low heating rates and long residence time of solid and vapor that has been used for centuries in the production of charcoal [41]. In intermediate pyrolysis, the biomass feedstock is burned at higher heating rates in multiples of 100 °C/min and the residence time of vapor varies between 10 to 30 min [42,43]. In contrast, fast pyrolysis typically requires high heating rates ranging between 10 and 1000 °C/s accompanying a short residence time of approximately 0.5 to 2 s. Fast pyrolysis produces mostly bio-oil that makes up between 65% and 80% based on dry biomass volume [44,45]. In fast pyrolysis, the liquid portion of the final products is comprised of between 20 to 30 wt% in water content [46] and a wide range of different organic compounds, including acids, alcohols, aldehydes, phenols, sugars, furans, nitrogen, and oxygenated compounds [47]. Besides, flash pyrolysis (very or ultra-fast pyrolysis) occurs at rapid heating rates, ranging between 1,000 and 10,000°C/min. The process occurring during flash pyrolysis is likened to that of an ablative process [48]. In order to maximize liquid product yield in the final outputs, cooling and condensation of volatile compounds produced from the primary reactions should happen prior to the secondary decomposition reactions, which will then lead to the formation of lighter gaseous products. Depending on the types of pyrolysis, most of the biomass is converted into bio-oil and syngas for energy production, while about 10–20% converts into a solid form (biochar). Biochar, also known as biomass-derived charcoal, is made up of carbonaceous solid residue and ash based on the organic and inorganic components of biomass [49]. Besides its main application as activated carbon for filtration and purification, biochar can also be used as catalyst supports and precursor materials for carbon nanotubes [50,51]. During pyrolysis, non-condensable gases such as CO, CO2, and other light hydrocarbon gases are also released on top of the resulting biochar and condensable vapors. Pyrolysis process conditions such as temperature, heating rate, pressure, and residence time, as well as the quality and composition of biomass feedstock, highly affect the output yield distribution and physio-chemical properties of the final products [52]. These will be discussed in detail in section 4."
2,Lignocellulose biomass composition and pyrolysis behavior,
3,Lignocellulose biomass composition,"3.1 Lignocellulose biomass composition Lignocellulosic biomass is plant-derived biomass that can be broadly classified into the following four categories: hardwood, softwood, farm waste, and grasses [53]. Around the world, although billion tons of agricultural residues are generated annually [54,55], the majority of these are either burned in open fields or disposed of as waste [56]. Lignocellulosic biomass is an organic material that is naturally recalcitrant to biodegradation and contains the following main components [57]. In general, the structure of lignocellulosic biomass is illustrated in Fig. 2 . As discussed previously, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin are the three main components of lignocellulosic biomass [58]. Cellulose is a linear polymer, which is unbranched and represented by links of β-(1 bis4)-D-glucopyranose units. The enzymatic digestibility of lignocellulosic biomass is affected by cellulose crystallinity, as highly ordered areas are structurally more compact and hence naturally resistant to enzymes, acids, and swelling underwater. Analyses have shown that, in comparison with crystalline cellulose [59,60], amorphous cellulose could quickly be hydrolyzed at a higher rate [61]. In addition, the cellulose degree of polymerization also indicates the recalcitrance of biomass. The shorter the cellulose chain is, the faster the cellulose hydrolysis is. Studies have reported that the decrease in the polymerization degree can enhance the level of enzymatic hydrolysis, but these outcomes must be carefully interpreted as changes in the polymerization degree always involve changes in other variables, such as crystallinity [62]. Among the main components of biomass, lignin is the most recalcitrant constituent of the plant cell wall by which a natural barrier is formed to protect against the chemical and enzymatic degradation of plant cells. Unlike cellulose and hemicellulose, lignin is not a carbohydrate. It plays an important role in connecting together the other two components and preventing the penetration of other solutions or enzymes [63]. Lignin is a three-dimension polymer containing phenolic groups with a structural and cross-linked design, providing structural integrity and rigidity to the plant cell walls. Besides that, the important aspects expected to affect the level of biological degradation of lignocellulose by enzymes are the crystallinity and accessible surface area of cellulose, the degree of polymerization of cellulose, and the degree of hemicellulose acetylation [64]. Hemicellulose possesses both linear and branched linear polymers that are obtained from a class of different anhydrous sugars. However, due to a poor polymerization level, hemicellulose is the least resistant to mechanical and chemical degradation. Hemicellulose is always present with cellulose and lignin in the plant cell wall and is rarely found existing by itself in nature [65]. Hemicellulose is often regarded as a natural barrier to enzymatic hydrolysis, although the inherent crystallinity of cellulose and complex molecular structure of lignin plays a much more effective role in protecting the plant cell walls against degradation and decomposition. For biomass pretreated using either acid hydrolysis or liquid hot water methods, enzymatic hydrolysis has been shown to achieve greater efficiency in the absence of hemicelluloses in biomass [66,67]. In brief, the fraction of the main components in lignocellulosic biomass such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin was given in Table 3 . In addition, the range of components under the broader classification of hardwood (H), softwood (S), farm waste (W), and grasses(G) are also shown in the table. An in-depth analysis of the pyrolysis of these components would be particularly beneficial for achieving a better understanding of the pyrolytic mechanism of biomass and facilitating its direct applications relevant to fuels, chemicals, and bio-materials. From Table 3, it can be seen that cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose are the three main compositions affecting directly the product yield of the pyrolysis process. Depending on various the plant variety, the composition of obtained biomass from such plant varieties is different, resulting in significant differences in the yield of products after the pyrolysis process. In a study of Bourguignon et al. [88], they have compared the yield and components of synthesized biofuel via fast pyrolysis of various kenaf varieties. Resultantly, they found that the large differences in anatomy and composition of kenaf varieties are considered as the primary factors affecting the achieved target of liquid biofuel. In another study, Kelkar et al. [89] have analyzed the components of the eight grass species and evaluated the effects of biomass composition of such eight grass species on the yield of obtained products. They declared that biomass composition and thermal properties are responsible for the differences in pyrolysis products although the classification of grass varieties is found to have insignificant effects on product composition. Also, Oginni et al. [90] have analyzed the characterization of pyrolysis products for dedicated bioenergy crops such as two clonal varieties of Miscanthus and two varieties of Switchgrass. As a result, there is an insignificant difference in the biochar yields between varieties of Miscanthus and Switchgrass though the bio-oil yields could change in the wide range of 45–51%. Based on the above-mentioned analysis, it could be clarified that there is a close relationship between plant varieties and obtained product yields, this is due to the differences in the biomass composition between those plant varieties resulting from the soil characteristics, cultivation and climate conditions."
4,Pyrolysis behavior of lignocellulose biomass,"3.2 Pyrolysis behavior of lignocellulose biomass As analyzed, 40 to 60% of lignocellulosic biomass is cellulose which is made up of glucose monomers linking together by β-(1-4) glycosidic bonds. Generally, the cellulose pyrolysis behavior could be illustrated in Fig. 3 . The long-chain cellulose polymers exist regardless of biomass types but are differentiated by their degree of crystallinity and polymerization, as well as chain termination [91,92]. Yang et al. [93] relied on thermogravimetric analysis in examining the characteristics and pyrolysis behavior of the main components of biomass. Among the main findings, the authors revealed that the decomposition of cellulose mainly occurs at a temperature range of 315–400 °C. Nevertheless, there is still a wide range in the activation energy, specifically 166–250 kJ/mol [94], required for the breaking down of cellulose given the types of cellulose, parameters, computation processes, and other factors involved. Focusing on microcrystalline cellulose, Adenson et al. [94] applied the optimization techniques and regression objective function to estimate the required activation energy in a slow pyrolysis process which was recorded to be 199 ± 2.0 kJ/mol. As previously mentioned, operating conditions (temperature, heating rate, and residence time) highly influence the product yield of the pyrolysis process. At low temperatures, the conversion of cellulose produces more levoglucosenone (LGO) [95]. In contrast, low-molecular-weight linear compounds, e.g., hydroxyacetaldehyde (HAA), are more present in the final products of pyrolysis at high temperatures (>450 °C) [96]. Furthermore, the yields of levoglucosan (LG, the major component of pyrolysis-oil), which is thermally stable, are higher with short vapor residence time in a high-carrier-flow-rate environment [97]. Ansari et al. [98] demonstrated via thin-film pyrolysis experiments that the degradation of anhydrosugars and furans resulting in light oxygenate compounds increased with temperature. Using pyrolysis-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and in-situ infrared spectroscopy, Chen et al. [99] concluded that several organic compounds, including dehydrated saccharides, furans, and other low molecular weight compounds, are formed via many competing reactions in cellulose pyrolysis. In different research examining cellulose pyrolysis behavior, an experiment was set up using synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet single photoionization. The results showed a low yield of HAA produced as the results of secondary pyrolysis reactions [100]. Applying a different approach in their experiment, Xin et al. [101] utilized a generalized two-dimensional perturbation correlation infrared spectroscopy in their analysis of cellulose pyrolysis temperatures. The scientists first observed that the intramolecular dehydration of cellulose chains was initiated at temperatures below 300 °C. At between 300–430 °C, the following reactions, including decarbonylation, ring-opening polymerization, and aromatization begun. The majority of deoxygenation and condensation occurred once temperatures reached above 430 °C and up to 650 °C. According to Lu et al. [102], when performing a quantum chemical calculation, the formation of a number of characteristic chains ends, namely levoglucosan-terminated end, as well as other dehydration units, was the results of the primary breaking-up reactions of cellulose. These intermediate components and their formation patterns hold the key in determining the outcomes in the final product distribution. In their study, Zhang et al. [103] investigated the different conversion mechanisms of chain-end types in pyrolysis of anhydro-oligosaccharides. The results confirmed that when applying an integrated methodology consisting of the cleavage of glycosidic bonds followed by dehydration reactions, the formation of LG was more favorable compared to the results obtained from the other method, such as ionic and radical mechanism [104]. A recent study by Fang et al. [105] used a different methodology in which density functional theory, or DFT, a computational approach was applied to the pyrolysis of 13C-glucose. In conclusion, they confirmed that two major C4 furans found in bio-oil, namely 3-hydroxy-γ-butyrolactone and 3-(2H)-furanone, were largely the products of glucose C3–C6 fragment. In addition, the formation mechanisms of furfurals-based compounds like furfural (FF), 5- hydromethylfurfural (HMF)) [106,107] and others were also investigated. Researching into hemicellulose pyrolysis may offer measurable gain in understanding the pyrolysis reaction mechanism of native hemicellulose over monosaccharides or polysaccharides. Decades of studies have introduced a wide range of pretreatment processes that aid the subsequent extraction of hemicellulose from biomass. These pretreatments include hot pressurized water, alkali-based solutions such as hot alkali and alkaline peroxide, autohydrolysis/ steam explosion, wet oxidation, enzyme- or diluted-acid-based hydrolysis, microwave-assisted heating, organosolv, ozonolysis, etc. [108,109]. Nevertheless, due to hemicellulose being highly susceptible to degradation, no single method has been confirmed to successfully extract all hemicelluloses from biomass, including matrix of polysaccharides. Alkali solutions have commonly been used in the process of extracting hemicellulose [110,111]. One of the advantages of this method is its ability to retain the original integrity of hemicellulose by sustaining its highly polymerized structure. Consequently, such an approach yields a considerable amount of char as the result of thermal decomposition [112]. Moreover, the removal of acetyl groups of native hemicelluloses in the alkali-based extraction process limits the production of acids. In their experiment, Wang et al. [113] attempted to extract hemicellulose from a number of different biomass sources, including softwood species, i.e., Scot pines (Pinus sylvestris) and Chinese hemlock (Tsuga chinensis), hardwood species, i.e., blue gum (Eucalyptus saligna) and Manchurian ash (Fraxinus mandshurica), and agricultural residues, i.e., rice and corn straw. When applying dimethyl sulfoxide, which is a neutral solvent, into the process, the researchers were able to minimize the negative impact on hemicellulose structure while also preserving the acetyl groups and other branched polymers found in hemicellulose [112]. In the same study, the authors also revealed important distinctions in the characteristics of hemicelluloses extracting from the different biomass sources. In the case of softwood, polysaccharides including D-galacto-D-gluco-D-mannan and L-arabino-(4-O-methyl-D-glucurono)-D-xylan made up the main components of hemicelluloses, namely Pinus sylvestris (PSH) and Tsuga Chinensis (TCH). On the other hand, hardwood hemicelluloses, namely Eucalyptus saligna (ESH) and Fraxinus mandshurica (FMH), consisted mainly of (4-O-methyl-D-glucurono-D)-xylan, as well as high level of O-acetyl groups and uronic acids. Finally, hemicelluloses (CSH and RSH) from rice and corn straw contained mainly L-arabino-(4-O-methyl-D-glucurono)-D-xylan. According to the above study, hexose and xylose were the two types of monosaccharide found in softwood hemicellulose and hardwood/straw hemicellulose. The maximum achieved temperature in softwood hemicellulose pyrolysis was around 310 °C and appeared to be the highest among those occurring in hemicellulose pyrolysis from hardwood and straw. The specific temperatures were as follows, 274 °C for ESH and 286 °C for FMH in hardwood hemicellulose and 291 °C for CSH and 286 °C for RSH in straw hemicellulose. Furthermore, the activation energy reported in softwood hemicellulose pyrolysis (160 kJ/mol) was slightly higher than that of both hardwood and straw hemicellulose (150 kJ/ mol). This small difference in activation energy could be due to the prevalence of hexose over pentose sugars in the form of β-1,4-glycosidic linked polymers present in softwood hemicellulose resulting in its higher thermal stability. On the contrary, a greater amount of char, approximately 33 wt%, was yielded in the case of hardwood hemicelluloses, as opposed to 25−30 wt% found in softwood and straw hemicelluloses. The greater availability of pentose units with side branches resulted in an increase in the structural complexity of hemicellulose. Consequently, in the process of breaking the glycosidic linkages in these high-structure hemicelluloses, one could form many large molecular weight radicals. These radicals would then be converted into char when subjected to polymerization [112]. Considering the outputs, the product distribution from hemicelluloses pyrolysis was different among softwood, hardwood, and straw biomass. Particularly, large quantities of acids and furfural, as well as five-carbon compounds, were observed in hardwood and straw-derived hemicelluloses. In contrast, the products of softwood hemicelluloses pyrolysis were mainly six-carbon compounds (e.g., HMF and anhydrosugars). Furthermore, the researchers also found that when the neutral solvent was used, the hemicelluloses yielded from the process had a higher molecular weight than that of alkali-based extraction. This result highlighted the fact that the polysaccharides were only partially extracted. All in all, further examination of different methods of hemicellulose pyrolysis is warranted in order to gain an important understanding of the overall hemicellulose pyrolysis behavior. The different oxygen-containing functional groups found in lignin (e.g., carboxyl, carbonyl, hydroxyl, and methoxyl groups) are the main drivers behind lignin’s reactivity. With regard to the H/G/S composition ratio of lignin, softwood has a lower number of methoxyl groups (92–96/ppu) that can be found in hardwood (132–146/ppu) [114]. A correlation between methoxyl group contents and the production of pyrolysis char from lignin has been observed. The absence of methoxyl groups in C3/C5 positions in type-G and type-H lignin’s aromatic ring promotes further condensation; however, this isn’t the same case for type-S lignin [115,116]. Moreover, the further breaking up of these methoxyl groups into smaller molecular radicals during lignin pyrolysis enables the stabilization of large-molecule fragments and simultaneously stops their polymerization into char. Consequently, the higher methoxyl group contents in lignin results in a lower amount of char production. During lignin pyrolysis, the transformation of methoxyl groups highly influences the final outputs [116,117]. At high temperatures, type-S phenols can be transformed into type-G phenols, monophenols, or even catechols. The conversion is largely supported by the thermal decomposition of methoxyl groups. Indeed, when reaction temperatures increase from 400 to 800 °C, the formation of type-S phenols is hindered by the rising temperature. On the other hand, higher temperatures enhance the production of both type-H and type-G phenols, even maxing out the latter at 600 °C [118]. Organic compounds with low molecular weight, such as methane and methanol, are also present in the final products in the transformation of methoxyl groups in lignin [119,120]. During pyrolysis, low-temperature dehydration of lignin components enables the removal of side-chain aliphatic hydroxyl groups resulting in an unsaturated side chain. The types of biomass also have influences on the distribution and makeups of phenolic hydroxyl groups. Particularly, guaiacyl phenolic hydroxyl group units are mainly found in softwood lignin, while there are indications of negligible amounts of both p-hydroxyphenyl and syringyl phenolic hydroxyl groups. On the contrary, hardwood lignin contains mainly aliphatic hydroxyl groups, followed by guaiacyl phenolic, syringyl phenolic, and p-hydroxyphenyl in decreasing amounts. Comparing between grass and wood lignin, the former possesses a higher concentration of p-hydroxyphenyl. Overall, a correlation has been found between the types of lignin, the final phenolic pyrolysis products, and the distributions of phenolic hydroxyl groups [121,122]. Additionally, oxygen-containing groups, namely carboxyl and carbonyl groups, have also been detected in lignin. In breaking down these groups, smaller molecules, such as CO2, CO and formaldehyde, are formed and attached to the side chains of phenolic compounds [117,119]. Despite the progress made in the development of various extraction methods, successful separation of native lignin from biomass remains a complex and difficult task due to the high-level structure of lignin and its linkages with the remaining components found in organic plant matters. In their search for the best way to isolate lignin, researchers have demonstrated several preparation methods, such as Klason, Kraft, Björkman, organosolv, and sulfite pulping process [123–125]. Nevertheless, these various treatments have only been successful to a certain extent in altering the physiochemical properties of native lignin. Fig. 4 provides an example of a possible chain of reactions in lignin pyrolysis. At temperatures below 200°C, the reactions start out with a series of lignin softening, also known as glass transition, in which lignin is transformed into several liquid intermediates [126]. The second stage, which occurs at temperatures between 200 and 350 °C, involves the depolymerization of these intermediates, turning them into aromatic alcohols known as monolignols, including coniferyl, sinapyl, and p-curamryl alcohols. These organic compounds are then transformed into methoxyphenols, namely 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol, by severing the C=O and C=C bond [127]. As temperatures continue to increase above 350 °C and reach up to 500 °C, alkylphenols and phenol can be found in the decomposition of methoxyphenols via several pyrolysis reactions, such as dealkylation and demethoxylation process [128,129]. Finally, high temperatures above 500 °C allow for a secondary degradation of methoxyphenols to produce aliphatic, namely methanol [98]. The distribution of the biomass's three main components could influence the pyrolytic product yield. High cellulose and hemicellulose contents promote the production of bio-oil, while a greater concentration of lignin results in more biochar. Due to its structural complexity and stability, it is more difficult to break up lignin during pyrolysis leading to a higher yield of char [130]. These variations not only influence the yield, but also affect the final composition of the products obtained from the pyrolysis process. Based on their findings, Pǎrpǎriţǎ et al. [131] revealed that the type of biomass directly affects the percentage of different compounds found in the bio-oil. They discovered from the experiments that in comparing the content between bio-oil yielded from the pyrolysis of forest-based biomass (e.g., sawdust from Eucalyptus globulus, Norway spruce) and from agricultural biomass (e.g., energy grass, Brassica rapa), the former exhibits greater amount of carboxylic acids, furans, and ketones, while also showing a lower quantity of phenols. Stefanidis et al. [132] focused on the study of each individual biomass component pyrolysis. Firstly, for cellulose pyrolysis, sugars, mainly in the form of levoglucosan, have the highest concentration found in the liquid products. Simple organic compounds such as aldehydes, alcohols, phenols, and ketones were found in lesser amounts. Secondly, the authors found that the bio-oil of lignin pyrolysis was made up almost entirely of complex, high-molecular-weight phenols. Lastly, ketones, phenols, acids, and aldehydes could be found in the bio-oil from hemicellulose pyrolysis. In the study of Chang et al. [133], they identified phenol as the main component in bio-oil obtained from pyrolysis of palm kernel shell as the result of the thermal decomposition of lignin-derived intermediate, p-coumaryl alcohol. On the other hand, acetic acid was more abundant in the wheat straw and pine sawdust bio-oil due to the larger presence of cellulose and hemicellulose in this raw biomass. Thus, the composition of the biomass, especially its hydrogen-to-carbon (H/C) ratio, has an important bearing on the pyrolysis yield."
5,Effects of key pyrolysis parameters,
6,Pretreatment of biomass for the pyrolysis process,"4.1 Pretreatment of biomass for the pyrolysis process The thermal processing of biomass is hampered because raw forms of biomass are highly complex, both mechanically and chemically. Grinding and pelletization, for example, make the products denser and more uniform in terms of physical and chemical properties [134]. The pretreatment of the biomass can improve the quality of the product of pyrolysis, such as bio-oil. Biomass is generally alkali rich and therefore causes ash-related problems [135]. The Cl and S contents in the biomass form acidic products on combustion and can corrode metal surfaces and cause pollution [136]. Acidic or alkaline pretreatment can improve the hydrocarbon and energy contents while decreasing the high moisture generally associated with the process of pyrolysis. Further, the low energy content and high moisture content of biomass pose a problem during pyrolysis. As a result, if dwelled into, thermal pretreatment is also a viable alternative. One of the simplest mechanical pretreatments available is the grinding of the biomass. Grinding, though cost dense, can decrease the size of the particles available. This improves the heat flow between the substrates and decreases the level of polymerization during pyrolysis, thereby yielding better quality bio-compounds [137]. It was observed that the composition of bio-oil was different when the particle size was small. Another mechanical pretreatment is to densify the biomass before pyrolysis. The low density is what causes the lower rate of heat transfer between the substrates. On densification by using mechanical force, i.e., compaction, the void spaces in the biomass decrease, which increases the heat generation and durability [138]. Furthermore, it decreases the moisture content in the biomass and increases the energy content. Chemical pretreatments include a large variety of treatments. The most common are the acidic and alkaline pretreatments of the biomass. Acidic pretreatment involves the removal of compounds of sulfur, chlorine etc., which tend to have a negative effect on the bio-oil. The treatment generally involves the use of dilute acids (H2SO4 widely) to cleave the C-O bonds. Further, this process decreases the tendency of the product to corrode metals. The inorganic compounds may also cause an increase in undesirable characteristics, like viscosity, which can be avoided using acidic treatment [139]. Casoni et al. [140] utilized a different approach in their study while focusing on the performance of biomass pyrolysis, as well as acid- and fungus-treated biomass. The experiments found that cellulose-only pyrolysis (i.e., in the absence of lignin) yielded the highest bio-oil amount. Furthermore, acid and fungus application to the biomass feedstock showed contrasting impacts in the pyrolytic liquid yield. The presence of enzymatic activity in mushrooms was shown to promote the degradation of lignin structure, thus making it more susceptible to thermal breaking during pyrolysis reactions. Hence, fungus-treatment of biomass could increase the liquid yield. On the contrary, acid pretreatment showed a negative effect on liquid yield because of its tendency to protect cellulose fibers from thermal decomposition. Alkaline pretreatment involves treating the biomass with alkaline solutions like NaOH, NH4OH, etc. Alkaline pretreatments tend to decrease the degree of polymerization and improve the internal surface area of treated biomass [141]. Further, alkaline pretreatment can decrease the ash content. Another widely used method is the Ammonia Fibre Expansion (AFE) to improve the structure of biomass. The procedure is conducted in a reactor with pressure and temperature control under a steady flow of ammonia. On increasing the pressure rapidly, the ammonia evaporates, and the system of the temperature starts dropping. This process is mainly used to eliminate the acetyl groups. The results also show enhanced durability, thermal stability, and particle density of the biomass [142]. The process also does not affect the kinetics or mechanisms of pyrolysis, which is an added advantage. Steam explosion is a cost-effective method that is used to improve the biomass structure. It has a low energy consumption and does not require any chemical addition. The biomass is loaded in a vessel, and water is added. The required temperature and pressure are obtained by heating the mixture. The steam-biomass mixture is held for a while, and then the pressure is reduced, causing explosive decompression. The steam explosion treatment also shows a decrease in alkaline and alkaline earth metals [143]. This form of pretreatment can be used to get rid of oxygenated compounds which are not required. The commonly used thermal pretreatment is called torrefaction. Torrefaction is the thermal pre-heating of biomass to change the fibrous structure and to decrease the moisture levels [144]. Torrefaction is of two types: dry and wet. Dry torrefaction involves pre-heating the biomass in an inert and dry atmosphere in the absence of oxygen. The process helps in the migration of oxygen and carbon, which is important to increase the density of the biomass. Also, dry torrefaction improves the ability of the pyrolysis process to provide a bio-oil with enhanced aromatics and calorific values. The residence time and temperature of the torrefaction play an important role in the products formed during pyrolysis. Wet torrefaction is a process of biomass pretreatment using hot-compressed water as a reaction medium [145]. Unlike dry torrefaction, wet torrefaction produces a liquid by-product containing dissolved sugars. The process is suitable based on the hydrophobicity of the source. Both dry and wet torrefaction form solid by-products and gives a substantial improvement in the solid biomass structure and quality. It also shows a better pyrolysis yield and quality of bio-oil."
7,Effects of temperature,"4.2 Effects of temperature In pyrolysis, temperature plays an important role in providing the thermal energy required to break up the chemical bonds of different biomass molecules. As such, researchers have focused on the role of temperature having on the biomass pyrolysis process and the resulting bio-oil yield, as demonstrated in several experimental studies [16]. Among the different approaches, thermogravimetry/differential thermal analyses (TG-DTA) is a technique that has been commonly applied in laboratory-scale studies in simultaneously measuring the changes in mass and temperature of the biomass [146]. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is the thermal analysis component that is used to discern the difference in physical and chemical characteristics of materials resulting from changing temperatures within a predetermined range and at a specific heating rate. Concurrently, the observed mass loss resulting from dehydration and decomposition can be analyzed in the thermogravimetric analyzer (TG) and the subsequent carbonization process at high temperatures. Because the feedstock's physical and chemical composition plays a fundamental role in pyrolytic behavior, the TG-DTA analysis provides a clear idea about the degradation and activation energy of different pyrolysis stages [147]. Typically, there are three identifiable zones in the TGA curve of biomass. These three separate zones are categorized as follows: dehydration (first zone), decomposition (second or also known as main pyrolysis zone), and carbonization (third zone). Temperatures record in the second zone of the TGA curve, in which the largest percentage of biomass weight is lost due to the decomposition of main biomass components and the determination of the optimal thermal condition for pyrolysis. The DTA uses a sample’s (alumina or aluminum) temperature as a reference for comparing the temperature of the test sample. Prior to reaching the exothermic or endothermic phase in which the melting or decomposition process takes place, these two temperatures are expected to be more or less equal [148,149]. Results from several studies have identified that a temperature range between 300 and 550 °C is the most ideal for the formation of liquid yield. Nevertheless, it is highly influenced by the biomass feedstock and other changing variables [150–152]. This is absolutely matched with the weight loss characteristic of main components in biomass such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, illustrated in Fig. 5 . According to Tsai et al. [153], higher oil yield was obtained when the temperature of rice husk pyrolysis increased from 400 to 500 °C, corresponding to 11.26 to 35.92% in oil yield respectively. The growth rate in oil yield with the increase in temperatures slowed down as temperatures got up to above 500 °C. The oil yield maxed out at around 40% as temperatures reaching up to 800 °C. The study of Lazzari et al. [154] confirmed the optimal temperature range for mango seed almond pyrolysis was between 450 and 650 °C. In this case, the maximum bio-oil yield (38.8%) occurred at the upper limit of the temperature range (650 °C). While higher temperatures generally have a positive influence on the liquid yield from pyrolysis, the opposite case is found to be true because extremely high temperatures have a detrimental effect on the liquid yield of the final products. This effect is further explained by the high-temperature induced secondary cracking of the volatiles favoring higher gas formation over liquid yield [14]. The above behavior was demonstrated by Jung et al. [155] in performing sawdust pyrolysis using a fluidized bed reactor. The authors observed a positive change in bio-oil yield from 56 to 72 wt% with rising temperatures from 350 to 405 °C; however, the yield dropped to 61 wt% as temperatures climbed up to 510 °C. Furthermore, a similar behavior was observed in the pyrolysis of rice straw as the highest bio-oil yield was attained at 445 °C; any increase or decrease in temperature resulted in lower yields. Zheng et al. [156,157] further provided examples in supporting this theory as they revealed from their experiments that temperatures below 420 °C did not provide sufficient heat for the rice husk or sawdust pyrolysis in a fluidized bed reactor. On the other hand, high temperatures above 540 °C limited the yield of liquid fuel. They concluded that the optimal range of temperatures for rice husks or sawdust pyrolysis would be between 420 and 540 °C. A wide range of temperatures has been found for the pyrolysis of different biomass types in maximizing liquid yield. For cotton stalk, temperatures ranging between 480 and 530 °C are considered to be the most ideal [158]. Examples of biomass sources and their corresponding optimal pyrolysis temperatures and maximum liquid yield are listed as follows (in increasing order of temperatures): neem de-oiled cake (400 °C, 40.2 wt%) [159], Cynara cardunculus L. (400 °C, 56.23 wt%) [160], rice husk (450 °C, 70 wt%) [161], poplar (455 °C, 69 wt%) [162], cassava stalk (469 °C, 61.39 wt %) [163], cassava rhizome (472 °C, 63.23 wt%) [163], sugarcane bagasse (475 °C, 56 wt%) [164], Jatropha seed shell cake (470 °C, 48 wt%) [165], residues from palm tree (500 °C, 72.4 wt%) [166], pistachio shell (550 °C, 20.5 wt%) [167], olive bagasse (600 °C, 72.4 wt%) [160]. As shown in Fig. 6 , feedstock characteristics and related pyrolytic operating conditions highly affect the bio-oil yield. Higher bio-oil yields are commonly found in the pyrolysis of woody biomass. Among these, clean wood (CW) and poplar pyrolysis [44,171] have achieved the highest bio-oil yield compared to other energy crops, as well as other agricultural residues. It can be reasoned that the levels of cellulose and hemicellulose containing in woody biomass are higher than those found in the other biomass types. Coming in second place in terms of bio-oil yields after woody biomass is energy crops (reed) which is followed by agricultural residues. In a study of Azargohar et al. [168], they observed a continuous increase in bio-oil yield with rising pyrolysis temperatures from 400 to 550 °C in wheat straw pyrolysis. However, they revealed that bio-oil production began to drop when temperatures exceeded 500°C, particularly in the case of flax straw and sawdust. When the same pyrolysis conditions were applied, Pattiya [172] confirmed in their studies that temperatures between 475 and 510 °C were the most suitable for achieving the highest yield of organic products in the case of cassava stalk and rhizome. Furthermore, the makeups of the initial biomass feedstock have a significant influence on the optimal pyrolysis temperatures. As demonstrated by Biswas et al. [173], the study suggested that the optimal pyrolysis temperature to attain the highest bio-oil yield is determined by each individual biomass component. Temperature variations can have an impact on the quality of the liquid outputs from biomass pyrolysis. Low-temperature pyrolysis yields bio-oil that is made up mainly of alkanes, aliphatic nitriles, amides, esters, and long-chain fatty acids. Furthermore, higher pyrolysis temperatures are conducive to the cracking of aliphatic species in forming aromatics. Consequently, lower hydrogen to carbon (H/C) ratio and higher concentration of organo nitrogen compounds are found in the resulting bio-oil. In their study, Ly et al. [174] revealed the presence of shorter aliphatic carbon-containing compounds and small molecules of alcohols and ketones, as well as their derivatives, in bio-oil products obtained from high-temperature pyrolysis. Additionally, an increase in pyrolysis temperatures could lead to a higher concentration of phenols but lower amounts of ketones and acids [161]. Nevertheless, an increase in temperatures did not alter the concentration level of water, nitrogenous substances, and other organic compounds such as aldehydes and ethers. The hydrogen-to-carbon content in pyrolysis products provides a good insight into the output quality. In particular, higher content of carbon and hydrogen is essential in producing high-quality bio-oil; however, higher oxygen content negatively affects the calorific value of bio-oil [175]. Among the studies examining the content quality of biomass pyrolysis liquid outputs, Ateş and Işikdaǧ [176] indicated a lower oxygen content and a higher carbon and hydrogen contents were found in the pyrolysis products of wheat straw and oat straw when the temperature is increased. In the experiment examining the pyrolysis behavior of the biomass key components, Quan et al. [177] found that the cellulose and hemicellulose pyrolysis each yielded 30.83 and 18.67% in liquid product, while just a little over 0.5% in liquid yield was produced by lignin pyrolysis at the temperature of 500 oC. Since cellulose has high volatility than hemicellulose, high cellulose content can result in high bio-oil yield [178]. Utilizing a variety of different biomass feedstock, including jatropha cake, palm kernel shell, and empty fruit bunch formed from oil palm, Kim et al. [165] concluded that the biomass pyrolysis with high cellulose and hemicellulose contents produced a high amount of bio-oil. On the other hand, there were no significant differences in product outputs from the pyrolysis of corncob, straw, and oregano stems, as demonstrated in the study by Yanik et al. [179]. Despite the higher lignin content found in corncob, its pyrolysis did not yield a greater amount of char compared to that of straw and stalk pyrolysis. These findings could be explained by the high heating rates applied in this particular study. In the pyrolysis process, operating temperature conditions have a significant impact on the final product composition [180,181]. Common fast pyrolysis products include bio-oil, biochar, and syngas. The bio-oil is strongly influenced by the operating temperatures and biomass types, while its physicochemical properties and content, such as percentage of hydrocarbon, acidity, and viscosity, depend on the catalysts used and operating temperature of the process [182,183]. Boxiong et al. [184] examined the effects of temperature on the yields of different pyrolysis products, including bio-oil, bio char, and syngas, using waste tire at temperatures between 350 and 500 °C. When temperatures increased within the above interval, the researchers observed an increase in syngas formation between 23.7 and 35.5 wt%; simultaneously, there was a decrease in the bio-oil production from 32.1 to 40.5 wt%. Moreover, they also found that higher temperatures (>500 oC) were more favorable in the production of syngas. In the pyrolysis process, the temperature is the main driving force behind the thermal cracking of biomass compounds. Higher yields of bio-oil, as opposed to biochar, are commonly found in low to moderate-temperature pyrolysis products [185,186]. At very high temperatures, which are the prerequisite for secondary cracking of vapor, bio-oil and syngas start to form in the final pyrolysis products. Thus, temperature increases have a favorable effect on liquid yield, but at extremely high temperatures, the reverse effect is found in the majority of the experiments examined. It happens when secondary cracking of the volatiles occurs at extremely high temperatures, resulting in a higher gas yield. Another important consideration in optimizing pyrolysis temperature is biomass composition. The following components typically make up the main contents in biomass, cellulose (40–50%), hemicellulose (20–40%), lignin (16–33%), extractives (0–15%), and negligible amounts of inorganic minerals [15,18]. Biomass composition also affects the optimal temperature in the pyrolysis process due to the fact that different temperatures favor the decomposition of each component. Particularly, temperatures between 370 and 400 °C are ideal for lignin decomposition. However, lower ranges of temperatures are found to be more suitable for breaking up cellulose and hemicellulose components in biomass (330–370 °C and 200–350 °C, respectively) [187,188]. A summary of optimal temperatures among different types of biomass pyrolysis can be found in Table 4 . For most common biomass feedstocks, which have a similar composition in the cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin contents, the typical temperature range for the pyrolysis process is 400 to 600 °C. According to the preceding discussion, there is a favorable relationship between biomass conversion efficiency and temperature since the increased amount of energy available during high-temperature reactions promotes the decomposition of biomass bonds. The yield of gaseous products increases with increasing temperature because secondary cracking reactions of pyrolysis vapors and secondary decompositions of char occur at higher temperatures, resulting in an overall rise in gaseous product yield. The amount of char produced is also affected by the temperature of the pyrolysis. Low temperatures produce more char; while high temperatures produce less."
8,Effects of heating rate,"4.3 Effects of heating rate The heating rate is another important consideration in biomass pyrolysis due to its strong influence on the decomposition process. The experiment performed by Onay et al. [193], analyzing the pyrolysis effects of rapeseed using three different heating rates, including 100, 300, and 800 °C/min, in a fixed bed reactor. The researchers observed an approximately 58% spike in bio-oil yield as heating rates went up from 100 to 300 °C/min. The growth rate in bio-oil yield was insignificant as the heating rate reached above 300 °C/min. Several studies have found variations in heating rates for optimal production of the liquid-based products in the pyrolysis process of different biomass types. For example, in their experiment involving the pyrolysis of sesame stalk in a fixed bed reactor with heating rates between 100 and 700 °C/min, Ateş et al. [194] found that the maximum bio-oil amount was attained at 500 °C/min. Meanwhile, Tsai et al. [153] analyzed the pyrolysis process of rice husk with variations of heating rates between 100 to 500 °C/min. The highest oil yield was obtained at 200 °C/min and then stabilized above this threshold. Similarly, higher heating rates also improved the liquid product yield in the pyrolysis of soybean in a fixed bed reactor. This result was from the experiment conducted by Uzun et al. [195], in which they recorded a 23.36% increase in bio-oil yield with an increase in the heating rate of 5−700 °C/min. Pütün et al. [196] analyzed the product composition in pyrolysis of tobacco residues performed in a fixed bed reactor. At the heating rate of 7 °C/min, the reaction achieved 27% in oil yield, which was the maximum percentage in the liquid product at this level. The bio-oil yield increased by 10% once the heating rate reached up to 300 °C/min., Moralı and Şensöz [197] found no significant change in the yield of bio-oil over a range of heating rates between 7 and 50 °C/min when using hornbeam shells as the feedstock for their pyrolysis reaction. The results suggested that variations in heating rates did not have a real and significant impact on the pyrolysis outputs of this particular biomass. Interestingly, Şensöz et al. [198] found the opposite effect of heating rate on the liquid product yield from biomass pyrolysis. Applying olive bagasse as the feedstock in the pyrolysis process performed in a fixed bed reactor [199], they observed a decreasing bio-oil yield with increasing heating rates. Indeed, the bio-oil amount was reduced by approximately 3.4−8.4% when heating rates rose from 10 to 50 °C/min. Besides, they provided contrasting results to those observed in previously referenced studies which might suggest the presence of other influencing factors in the pyrolysis process. In a study by Razuan et al. [200], they found opposite effects that heating rate had on the pyrolysis of different biomass types. Applying the same pyrolysis conditions to palm stones and palm kernel cake, they found that the bio-oil yield from the pyrolysis of palm stones decreased as heating rates rose from 5 to 10 °C/min. However, for palm kernel cake pyrolysis, the opposite effect was observed in which the liquid yield increased with a positive change in heating rates. Ben Hassen-Trabelsi et al. [201] recorded a drop in bio-oil yield from 80 to 5 wt% in the pyrolysis of waste animal fats as the heating rate was increased from 5 to 15 °C/min. Analyzing the difference in feedstock composition can offer an explanation for the diverging pyrolytic behavior as a result of changing heating rates. It is believed that the high heating rates can lead to further cracking of condensable vapors found in the pyrolysis of triglycerides materials. Şensöz and Angin [202] found no difference in the chemical compositions of bio-oil output from safflower seed press cake pyrolysis under three different heating rate values of 10, 30, and 50 °C/min. A pronounced effect that higher heating rates had on the water content of bio-oil was demonstrated in the study by Uzun et al. [195]. Particularly, increasing heating rates reduced the water content and improved the overall quality of bio-oil. Rapid heating was possibly responsible for the retardation of the secondary dehydration reactions leading to a lower water content in bio-oil produced. Higher heating rates also decreased the oxygen content in the liquid outputs of pyrolysis. This observation indicates a likely increase in oxygenated gases, such as CO2 and CO, under high heating rate conditions [203]. The conventional method associated with biochar production is characterized by the slow pyrolysis of biomass. Specifically, the slow pyrolysis process required in biochar production typically involves a low heating rate, typically 0.1–0.8 °C/s [31,45] and longer residence time ranging anywhere between 5 to 30 min up to as long as 25 to 35 h in some cases with temperatures of 300–550 °C. Typically, woody biomass is known to yield more product than herbaceous biomass due to the former containing fewer minerals [204]. Higher temperatures reduce the biochar yield because the main organic components of biomass, namely cellulose and hemicellulose, are completely burned at higher temperatures [205,206]. Researchers are inconclusive in generalizing the common trends describing the effect different heating rates have on pyrolytic product yields (Fig. 7 ). However, it can be safe to conclude that the nature of biomass feedstock and operating conditions are the main determinants in bio-oil and biochar production in slow pyrolysis. Fast pyrolysis is able to achieve the highest level of bio-oil outputs (75%) at temperatures around 500 °C [170,208] owing to very high heating rates, short residence times, and rapid quenching of vapors maximizing the production of the liquid product [209]. Biochar and syngas can also be found among the products of fast pyrolysis; however, an increase in syngas yield means a reduction in the yields of both bio-oil and biochar [210]. Under fast pyrolysis conditions, which require high heating rates ranging between 10 and 1000 °C/s and very short residence time-varying in the range of 0.5 and 2 s, bio-oil outputs could achieve between 65 and 80% of the initial dry biomass volume [45,211]. In general, fast pyrolysis favors the production of liquid yields, which could be as high as 75% of the total final products. Higher heating rates in fast pyrolysis can shorten the time biomass being exposed to the high temperature, as well as minimize the disruption and time lag between the primary and secondary cracking process. Consequently, the combined effect of a higher heating rate and fast vapor condensation limits the secondary cracking and promotes the production of light compounds and aromatics [212,213]. There are several clear distinctions between the primary and secondary cracking processes. In the former, the production of non-condensable gases, such as CO, CO2, H2O, and H2, light hydrocarbons such as C1-C3 alkanes, bio-oil, and biochar occurs via the decomposition of biomass. On the contrary, since the secondary cracking process involves both a longer residence time and higher temperatures, it limits the production of bio-oil in favor of biochar and gas yield [214]. The presence of the secondary cracking process can have a further impact on the characteristics of bio-oil in terms of its content and quality. Thus, based on the above discussion, it can be said that fast heating most likely prevents secondary dehydration reactions, resulting in a decrease in water content in the bio-oil. At higher heating speeds, the oxygen content of the pyrolysis liquid product is also reduced. It implies that the formation of oxygen-containing gases like CO2 or CO accelerates to high heating speeds."
9,Effects of particle size,"4.4 Effects of particle size The size of biomass particles is another important factor affecting bio-oil yield. Due to its large influence on the heating rate and heat transfer process during pyrolysis, it is considered one of the primary operating parameters in catalytic pyrolysis. According to the current literature [215], researchers have confirmed a negative correlation between particle size and heat transfer on the subsequent bio-oil yield. Particularly, larger biomass particle sizes retard the heat transfer across the diameter of particles leading to a negative impact on the bio-oil yield. In contrast, biomass with smaller particle sizes allows for more even heating and optimization of pyrolysis residence time, creating favorable conditions for bio-oil production. Such a hypothesis has been supported by several studies confirm that the positive effect of smaller size particles on bio-oil yield and quality obtained from different biomass sources [216,217]. The use of smaller particle sizes between 355 and 500 μm in pyrolysis has been considered to be effective in limiting agglomeration [218]. Feedstock sizes in the range of a few hundred microns can promote heat and mass transfer, especially in the earlier steps in the pyrolysis process. The following parameters have an important role in the liquid production of the fast pyrolysis process, such as chemical kinetics, the degree of heat and mass transfer, and phase transition. In turn, these factors are strongly dependent on biomass particle sizes. It has been demonstrated that decreasing particle sizes to below 2 mm can enhance heat transfer and increase overall bio-oil yield [219]. The smaller particle size promotes the mass and heat transfer, which increases the biomass degradation using a relatively shorter residence time [219]. Biomass particle size is the main determinant in controlling the heat transfer rate [52]. In fast pyrolysis, high heating rate and short residence time are easier to attain in the presence of small particles in biomass feedstock. On the other hand, the heating rate suffers from larger particle sizes which favor the production of char [195]. Fig. 8 presents the effect of biomass particle size on the product yield. According to past and current research findings, particle sizes ranging between 60 to 125 μm are optimal in maximizing the bio-oil yield (Fig. 8a) [220]. However, some researchers have agreed that biomass particle sizes of 150 to 300 μm are the most optimal in the production of pyrolysis oil [221–223]. The bio-oil yield would be decreased along with the increase in biomass particle sizes (Fig. 8b and Fig. 8c). However, all researchers agreed that the increase in biomass particle sizes to over-large sizes has resulted in deteriorating the yield of all products. It has been shown that particle sizes under certain thresholds can retard thermal conductivity and are extremely susceptible to fast decomposition leading to secondary reactions of vapor and increase in syngas yield. For example, by changing particle sizes between 0.425 and 1.8mm. As seen from the results obtained in the above-referenced studies, the type of biomass and other related factors have direct influences on the choice of optimal particle size in achieving the highest bio-oil yield. Generally, particle sizes can also affect the product yield in the pyrolysis process. It has been shown that large particle sizes retard the heat transfer rate leading to high biochar yield with a lower overall amount of bio-oil and syngas. On the other hand, biomass pyrolysis of smaller particle size shows improvement in bio-oil production due to the greater heat transfer [225,226]. All in all, the optimization of bio-oil yield in pyrolysis can be done by selecting the right temperature and particle size of feedstock. However, it remains challenging in drawing general conclusions or simple rules of thumb on how varying particle sizes of biomass affect the pyrolysis liquid products. The array of contrasting findings from within current literature further highlights this particular issue. In certain instances, when greater financial gains received from the higher pyrolytic liquid yield could offset the extra costs incurred by the additional milling process of biomass, the resulting smaller particle sizes are then deemed favorable in attaining optimal liquid product yields. In general, the relationship between particle size and biomass pyrolysis could be given in Table 5 . Because of the contradictory details on the optimal biomass size found in the literature, it is difficult to generalize this parameter to a pyrolysis method. Furthermore, biomass size reduction is correlated with milling costs and can be considered if the extra cost is compensated by improved pyrolytic liquid yield."
10,Effects of pressure,"4.5 Effects of pressure Another key factor affecting the product distribution in biomass pyrolysis is pressure. Pyrolysis performed at high-pressure results in a greater percentage of biochar and syngas compared to those found in atmospheric-pressure pyrolysis [237]. The high biochar yield under high pressure is due to the addition of volatile matter to carbon-rich material as a result of increased residence time [238]. In the latter case, CO has been found to make a significant portion of syngas produced. When applying increasing pressure to the pyrolysis process (i.e., reaching 1 MPa), CO production is typically replaced by CH4, H2, and CO2 [239]. This particular change in gas formation could be attributed to higher pressures causing the vapors to stay longer inside the reactor. The longer residence time, in turn, advances the secondary cracking process, which results in higher biochar and gas yields. Moreover, the decrease in oxygen and hydrogen contents, along with augmentation of CO2 in syngas is resulted from decarboxylation reaction. In spite of its negative impact on bio-oil yield, high pressure pyrolysis condition allows for reduced oxygen content and higher calorific of bio-oil compared to that found in pyrolysis performed under atmospheric pressure [240]."
11,Effects of the residence time,"4.6 Effects of the residence time The pyrolysis residence time is highly dependent on the ability to apply and maintain a predetermined level of temperature during the entire process. In batch processing, achieving the intended outcomes typically requires a residence time that is sufficient to complete the process. Longer residence time is the prerequisite for secondary reactions in which the carbonization and thermal cracking have potentially decreased the yield of bio-oil [153,241]. Furthermore, the residence time is an important parameter for outlining the steps in designing pyrolysis reactors. The effects of residence time on the product yield and bio-oil component are presented in Fig. 9 . In the study of Pattiya et al. [244], the authors focused their investigation on the effect of feeding rate by conducting the pyrolysis of both stalk and rhizome obtained from cassava in a free-fall reactor. The bio-oil yield was decreased by 8−12% when the feed time increased from 1 to 3 h with the feeding rate of 100 g/min. In another study by Islam et al. [164], they observed a reduction in bio-oil and biochar yield, but the gas yield was increased under rising vapor residence time from 5 to 20 s when performing pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse using a fixed bed reactor. Generally, longer residence times have been considered more favorable for the secondary cracking of vapors which resulted an increase in the accumulation of fine char particles in the reactor tube, transfer line and hot filter. The presence of metals in char fines coupled with the permeable structure further facilitates the secondary reactions leading to a reduction in liquid yield. The effects of residence time on biomass pyrolysis are summarized in Table 6 ."
12,Effects of the flow rate of carrier gas,"4.7 Effects of the flow rate of carrier gas Pyrolysis produces high vapor-content products that could be subjected to further cracking, repolymerization, and re-condensation of char residues resulting in a lower bio-oil yield [203,248]. In order to limit these secondary reactions, it is strongly recommended to quickly extract the vapors from the reactor during the initial thermal decomposition. Among three commonly used inert gases (helium, nitrogen, and argon), nitrogen is the most commonly used gas in the pyrolysis process due to its low cost [249]. The inert gas does not react readily with other components in bio-oil due to low reactivity. The mixing of vapors with carrier gases can delay and eventually stop the secondary reactions. Hydrogen and methane are examples of reactive carrier gas that could potentially promote the hydrocarbon content in bio-oil. It is generally observed that the high gas flows can result in shorter vapor residence time occurring in the hot pyrolysis reaction zone. In the study of Onay [250], the analysis of safflower seed pyrolysis was performed under two different conditions, static condition and with a rapid gas flow rate of 100 cm3/min. The bio-oil yield was increased by 23 wt% under the rapid gas flow rate, compared to the bio-oil (44 wt%) obtained from static condition pyrolysis. Asadullah et al. [251] performed the palm kernel shell pyrolysis and confirmed a 14% increase in the bio-oil amount and lower the yield of both biochar and syngas by increasing nitrogen flow rate from 1 to 2 L/min. Moreover, slight positive changes in liquid yield with an increase in gas flow rates were also observed in similar experiments conducted in Heo et al. [248] and another study by Huang et al. [252]. Pattiya et al. [244] identified a diminishing return when the gas flow rate reached above a certain upper threshold. The bio-oil yield was enhanced when the gas flow rate increased from 1 to 1.5 L/min, whereas the gas flow rate above 1.5 to 3 L/min showed no significant effect on the bio-oil yield. In recent literature, studies have proved that the increase in inert gas flow rate can enhance the overall bio-oil yield. Nevertheless, very high gas flow rates can result in lower amounts of liquid products due to the incomplete vapor condensation resulting in a more favorable gas yield. Additionally, the fast flowing of inert gas can flood out some parts of the biomass from the reactor prior to the completion of the pyrolysis [229,253]. The trend of the nitrogen flow rate on product yield is presented in Fig. 10a, where the highest bio-oil yield was obtained with a nitrogen flow rate of 4 L/min, while the yield trend of gas and biochar appeared to be opposite. However, the increase in nitrogen flow rate to a higher value could lead to reduction in the bio-oil yield [224]. In contrast, with a low nitrogen flow rate <4 L/min, the increase in nitrogen flow rate could increase the bio-oil yield (Fig. 10b), this was considered as an expected result because secondary reactions were provided more time to convert the organic fraction into bio-oil [254]. Table 7 summarizes the literature of biomass under various gas flow rate. It is worth mentioning that the biomass composition has a certain degree of influence on the pyrolysis process. Combining high temperature and longer vapor residence time can enhance the production of oxygen-free bio-oil [203]. Thus, it is important to take into account other variables in order to optimize the vapor residence times in maximizing yield and improving the quality of bio-oil produced from pyrolysis."
13,Effects of moisture and ash in biomass,"4.8 Effects of moisture and ash in biomass Moisture found in the initial biomass feedstock can have a direct influence on the quality of bio-oil [30]. As a general guideline, the moisture content in the initial biomass feedstock should not exceed 12% in order to limit the water content in bio-oil products [257]. There are varied effects that high moisture content has on the characteristics of bio-oil, such as low calorific value, high stability, and high viscosity. Furthermore, depending on how viscous the liquid fuels are, it is one of the main determinants that affect the design and operation modes of the fuel injection system, fuel atomization, and subsequent combustion characteristics. In general, the increase in moisture level (but lower the limited value) would lead to a rise in bio-oil yield (Fig. 11a) [257,258]. In addition, the concentrations of H2, CH4, and CO (Fig. 11b) were reduced due to the high water content in the bio-oil. Nonetheless, the increase in the CO2 concentration could be observed when the moisture increased. This result could be attributed to the reaction (CO + H2O = CO2 + H2) [259]. Furthermore, ash content plays an important role in the product distribution of biomass pyrolysis. The level of ash content exhibits an opposing relationship with bio-oil compared to that of biochar and syngas. Higher ash content suggests a low bio-oil yield. Meanwhile, high biochar and gas production can be expected. Considering other common chemical elements, sodium and potassium have been found to lower the liquid products from pyrolytic reactions. The presence of sulfur and ammonium phosphate in biomass has been shown to significantly affect both bio-oil production and char formation [260]. By lowering the ash level in biomass from 5.36 to 1.03 wt%, the organic yield increased from 34.71 to 61.34% [166]. Examining different types of biomass in their study, Lee et al. [261] confirmed that the high ash content lowered the bio-oil yield while increased the char formation. Biomass with high volatile material content and low amount of ash resulted in high bio-oil production, as demonstrated in the study by Pattiya and Suttibak [163]. Similar results were found in Razuan et al. [200], Abnisa et al. [262], Pattiya et al. [244], and Fu et al. [263]. It has been observed that biomass having high volatile material content and greater reactivity is more favorable for the production of bio-oil [264]. Jung et al. [155] further supported this statement using the results from their investigation of rice straw and bamboo sawdust pyrolysis. In their experiment, biomass feedstock with high volatile material content yielded high amount of bio-oil. Analyzing the outputs from the pyrolysis of sewage sludge and lignocellulosic biomass, Alvarez et al. [265] observed a high char yielded in sewage sludge pyrolysis due to high ash content. Furthermore, Lim et al. [266] pointed out several other factors that also have a positive influence on the bio-oil yield, such as greater concentration of volatile matters, high heating value, carbon and nitrogen contents. Furthermore, lower levels of the following variables, such as moisture, ash content, fixed carbon, and other elements like oxygen, hydrogen, and sulfur can also promote bio-oil production from pyrolysis."
14,Effects of reactor type and production scale,"4.9 Effects of reactor type and production scale It would not be a complete and thorough analysis of the pyrolysis process without sufficient discussions on pyrolysis reactors. In recent years, pyrolysis reactors have been the subject of several important pilot-scale studies covering a wide range of reactor designs and operations, such as fixed bed, bubbling fluidized bed, circulating fluidized bed, rotating cone feeder, auger, ablative, among others [267,268]. Three types of the reactor (i.e., auger reactors, bubbling fluidized bed, and circulating fluidized bed reactors) have the most commercial potential and technical capability for widespread application is given their advantages in terms of simplistic designs, ease-of-operation, better temperature control, and more efficient heat transfer [269]. In recent times, there has been a noticeable development in the budding “intermediate pyrolysis” technology involving auger reactors [270,271]. Intermediate pyrolysis is characterized by much lower heating rates which allow for extended solids residence time in comparison to fast heating rates and generally short residence time associated with fast pyrolysis [272]. In spite of the lower yield, bio-oil obtained from the intermediate pyrolysis process is considered to be more stable, lower in oxygen content, and possessive of low molecular weight compounds [42,273]. There are three main components making up a typical pyrolyzer which include a reactor, cyclone, and condenser. The biomass feedstock went through several processes taking place inside each of these parts as it undergoes the pyrolysis process. The first step involves the combustion of biomass as the feedstock is transformed by various thermochemical reactions. The separation phase then takes place in the cyclone as liquid and gaseous products are segregated from the solid products [44]. Finally, the rapid cooling and quenching of vapor products occur in the condenser yielding bio-oil and other non-condensable gases. These various non-condensable gaseous products are often returned back into the pyrolyzer to be used for heating up and fluidizing the initial mixture. In some instances, the use of catalysts in pyrolyzers has been shown to be effective in enhancing the quality of the final products or transforming them into other products of higher economic value, which are known as catalytic pyrolysis and catalytic upgrading, respectively [274,275]. Depending on various reactor type, the products could be formed with various yield, this could be seen in Fig. 12 . Different types of reactors exist depending on the pyrolysis process (i.e., fast versus slow pyrolysis). Common types of reactor, such as drum reactor, rotary kiln reactor, and screw/auger reactor, are often used in slow pyrolysis systems. On the other hand, fast pyrolysis systems often include the application of rotating cones, entrained flow, vacuum, and ablative reactors [45,276]. The effects of reactor type on bio-oil yield are summarized in Table 8 . Commercial-scale pyrolysis applications are demonstrated by the examples of plants designed and installed by companies and research centers like VTT and Metso (Table 9 ). The reactors utilized among these different commercial applications include fluidized bed, circulating fluidized bed, ablative, vacuum pyrolysis, and rotating cone reactors. Overall, the fluidized bed has been observed to be the most popular choice among reactor types utilized among commercial-scale biomass pyrolysis plants."
15,Effects of heat source,"4.10 Effects of heat source Traditionally, biomass pyrolysis is performed by applying heat generated from either an external combustion source or an internal electric resistance heater. Recently, more advanced heating methods have been introduced, including plasma, microwave-assisted, and solar heating [288–291]. Compared to electrical heating methods used in conventional biomass pyrolysis, microwave-assisted pyrolysis relies on the same principle of microwave heating which applies electromagnetic radiation in heating up the materials inside the reactor. There are advantages to microwave pyrolysis relative to the other methods, notably high heating rate and large variation in particle sizes [292]. Microwave radiation could provide effective, rapid, energy-efficient, and homogeneous heating in the pyrolysis process. Studies have confirmed the positive effect on the quality and quantity of bio-oil obtained from microwave pyrolysis. Observed in their study, Halim and Swithenbank [293] obtained a much higher liquid product yield from microwave-assisted pyrolysis. The bio-oil also has a lower oxygen content of approximately 35 wt% compared to 43−45 wt% of bio-oil generated from the conventional slow pyrolysis of rubber wood. Robinson et al. [294] further highlighted the value-added compounds, such as LG and light phenols, in bio-oil obtained from microwave pyrolysis over conventional methods. Rapid heating and quick quenching processes associated with microwave pyrolysis are possible factors in delivering these positive results. The benefits offered by microwave pyrolysis however, are shadowed by the challenges plaguing its industrial application, such as maintaining uniform heating of biomass, large capital investment costs, and improvement on energy conversion efficiency [292]. Renewable energy sources, such as solar energy, offer an environmental-friendly and effective solution in providing a high temperature and fast heating rate source of thermal energy required for biomass pyrolysis. For the solar pyrolysis using beech wood, Zeng et al. [295] detected a large reduction in bio-oil yield (27−62 wt%) as temperatures increased from 600 to 1600 °C, while still preserving the high heating value in the resulting bio-oil (i.e., 30 MJ/kg) [296]. Other factors, including heating rate and particle size, have shown a notable influence on bio-oil production. Specifically, the amount of bio-oil dropped from 60.6 to 37.5 wt% when the heating rates increased from 5 to 50 °C/s [295]. Furthermore, the increase in biomass pellet length also negatively affects bio-oil yield caused by the presence of secondary tar reactions. Nevertheless, the high capital costs associated with solar equipment, such as heliostats, combined with the intermittent nature of solar energy provided the key obstacles in wider application of solar pyrolysis. Dealing with the intermittent problem, solution has been offered in using molten salt as the heat storage for concentrated solar energy; nevertheless, the technology is seldom used in bio-oil production [297]. Further research on the application of solar energy in biomass pyrolysis is still much needed."
16,Pyrolysis products and their properties,"Bio-oil, bio-char, and pyro-gas are essential byproducts of biomass pyrolysis [29]. The key constituent of pyrolysis substance is bio-oil, also known as pyrolysis oil, pyrolysis liquid, pyrolysis tar, bio-crude, wood liquid, wood oil, or wood distillate, among other names. This is often a dark brown, free-flowing liquid with a strong smoky, pungent odor [298]. This is an intensely polar substance that is largely immiscible with nonpolar petroleum-derived fuels. The solid residue left over from the pyrolysis of carbonaceous biomass is known as bio-char. The properties of bio-char are primarily determined by the process and biomass used. Pyro-gas is primarily composed of CO, CH4, CO2, and H2 and has a heating value of 6.4–9.8 MJ/kg [29]. It is used internally as process heat for pyrolysis. Bio-oil is a microemulsion made up of both continuous and discontinuous phases. The continuous phase is an aqueous solution of cellulose and hemicellulose decomposition products, as well as small molecules from lignin decomposition [299]. The pyrolytic lignin macromolecules dominate the discontinuous phase. Thus, bio-oils are complex mixtures of water and a wide range of organic compounds, the majority of which are acids, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, phenols, esters, furans, carbohydrates, multifunctional compounds, and massive molecular oligomers [39]. The moisture, salts, aldehydes, and large molecular oligomers are mostly responsible for inferior fuel properties. Table 10 compares the properties of different lignocellulosic biomass as well as inorganic material-based bio-oil to petroleum-based heavy fuel oil. The table shows that bio-oils have a high moisture and oxygen content, as well as a high viscosity and solid residues. Because of the significant (35-40 wt% on dry basis weight) oxygen content, the heating value of bio-oils usually varies between 15 and 25 MJ/kg, which is just 40–50% of the heating value of petroleum-based fuels (42–45 MJ/kg) [300]. Another unfavorable characteristic of bio-oil is its poor pH of 2-4.4 owing to the existence of carboxylic acids [15]. High oxygen content combined with the presence of acids may result in polymerization, agglomeration, or in situ oxidative reactions that increase acidity and volatility. One of the major disadvantages of using biomass as pyrolysis feedstock is the wide variety of the various biomass feedstocks, which jeopardizes downstream processes' feasibility. Because of their catalytic impact and the technological challenges that arise as a result of their existence, inherent inorganic elements such as alkali and alkaline earth metals significantly add to the enhancement of compositional heterogeneity concerns. As comprehensive study focusing on alkali and alkaline earth metals and certain trace metals (Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn) have been published in 2021 [306]. Bio-oil, on the other hand, is complex, thermally and chemically reactive, highly oxygenated, acidic, and corrosive to conventional materials, and, due to its unique composition, non-miscible with fossil fuels. Because of these characteristics, as well as inferior fuel properties, bio-oil is often required to be upgraded in order to be compatible with advanced combustion devices."
17,Upgrading of bio-oil,"The bio-oil upgrade is a critical step in the pyrolysis process to increase liquid fuel suitability for industrial use [30,307]. These treatments aim to reduce the high oxygen content of bio-oil [308], thus raising the hydrocarbon content of the fuel [309], enhancing its heating value [310] and other properties such as acidity and viscosity [311,312]. The upgrading route of bio-oil can be divided into three routes: physical, chemical, and catalytic [39,58]. Emulsification, Supercritical fluids, and solvent addition are three prominent pathways of the physical route. Three prominent catalytic routes are hydrocracking, hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), and steam reforming. The esterification process is mostly used in chemical upgrading."
18,Physical route,"6.1 Physical route Emulsification is the most basic method for improving bio-oil. As previously said, the existence of polar compounds in bio-oil, such as phenol, substituted phenols, and aromatic carboxylic acids, among others, renders it immiscible with hydrocarbon fuels [39]. They can be emulsified with diesel oil with the aid of surfactants. However, because of the corrosion problems involved with this procedure, it is seen as a short-term solution. Supercritical fluids (SCFs) have unusual transport properties, such as the ability to dissolve compounds that are not usually soluble in the solvent's liquid or gaseous phases, thus facilitating liquefaction/ gasification reactions [313]. SCFs have recently been used to improve oil yields and quality. Because of their superior properties, organic solvents such as ethanol, butanol, acetone, 2-propanol, n-hexanol, and methanol have been used. These solvents have a major impact on the yield and consistency of bio-oil. Another form of physical upgradation is solvent addition, in which the bio-oil is treated with polar solvents such as methanol to change its viscosity [58]. One drawback of this process is the high cost of separating valuable chemicals."
19,Catalytic route,"6.2 Catalytic route Hydrocracking is a thermal cracking mechanism (>350 °C) that is followed by hydrogenation at relatively high pressure (100–2000 psi), resulting in improved end product consistency [3,314]. Dual-function catalysts perform this operation, with silicaalumina or zeolite (HZSM-5, HY) catalysts providing the cracking function [315]. Furthermore, platinum and tungsten oxide catalyze the reactions, and nickel serves as a hydrogenation catalyst [316,317]. Alumina is often used as catalyst support [318]. Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), also known as hydrotreating, is a high-pressure, moderate temperature mechanism that removes oxygen by reacting it with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst [278]. It forms water and saturated carbon-carbon bonds by reducing the oxygenated compounds in bio-oil such as acids, aldehydes, esters, ketones, and phenols [58]. HDO of bio-oil is carried out at temperatures ranging from 250°C to 600°C [260] and pressures up to 300 bar [30,260]. High pressure results in increased hydrogen solubility and closer proximity to the catalyst base, allowing for a faster reaction rate and less coke forming [260]. Sulphide CoMo/Al2O3, NiMo/Al2O3 systems are widely used for HDO [279]. Steam reforming transforms petroleum fractions to more volatile products of higher octane numbers, and it is the result of many reactions, including cracking, isomerization, and dehydrogenation [29]. Hydrocarbons are converted into syngas (CO + H2) in this process through a high-temperature reaction with steam. Steam reforming of bio-oil is thought to be CO2-neutral, making it a sustainable path to hydrogen or synthesis gas [319]."
20,Chemical route,"6.3 Chemical route Organic acids from unprocessed bio-oil can be converted into their corresponding esters using alcohols in the presence of catalysts in catalytic esterification [39,58]. The esterification process will strip the majority of the acids, reducing the corrosiveness of bio-oil and increasing its stability. This esterification reaction is usually catalyzed by solid acid, solid alkali, or ionic liquid ion exchange resins, which can produce a significant amount of carbon residue and cause catalysts to deactivate rapidly [320]. One of the issues with this approach is the separation of consumed alcohols."
21,CO2–based benefits from the use of biomass and its pyrolysis,"Consumption of pyrolysis materials is more beneficial in terms of lowering CO2 emissions than other fossil-based commodities. Life cycle assessment is also used to measure the environmental advantages of biomass pyrolysis. Within this framework, impact assessment over the entire product life can be thoroughly examined by different scalar methods of study. For example, environmental toxicity and human health impacts of air pollutant emissions provide effective indicators for product footprints at the local level. Other measures, such as acidification and eutrophication, are examples of regional environmental effects. Global-scale assessments often use global warming potential (GWP) and ozone depletion potential as indicators. Studies have mostly paid attention to the life cycle assessment focusing on GWP of pyrolysis products. The different usages of biochar obtained from biomass pyrolysis result in a range of net GWP (−1500 to 160 kg CO2/ton), suggesting both reductions (negative values, reduction in CO2) and increase (positive values, increase in CO2) in GHG emissions relative to fossil fuels consumption [321]. The application of biochar in soil has been shown to be the most effective in curbing GHG emissions [321,322] and also more advantageous in terms of environmental benefits than power generation. In an example of a co-firing power plant using both biochar and coal, a decrease in GWP was observed despite the variation in those values depending on the cofiring ratio [280,323]. In terms of production scale, small-scaled bioenergy facilities have a lower GWP per unit than those used in larger-scale power generation due to the lower transportation energy requirements of biomass in small-scale operations. Cleary & Caspersen [281] supported this result in their investigation of smaller scale bioenergy facilities (250 kW) and large-scale production of electricity (211 MW). Feedstocks derived from energy crops and woody biomass residues have shown the greatest benefits in terms of GWP. Regardless of the final applications of biochar products obtained from biomass pyrolysis, the use of the above-mentioned feedstocks results in net GWP between −1000 to −1500 kg CO2/ton. Additionally, feedstocks yielded from agricultural residues also result in potential net GWP benefits (i.e., −700 to −900 kg CO2/ton). On the other hand, the use of cardboard feedstocks has yielded mixed results, which depends on the final application of the biochar products [282]. Indeed, when the resulting biochar is combusted for energy generation, the GWP value is 160 kg CO2/ton above that of fossil fuels which indicates a negative effect. On the other hand, biochar intended for soil application results in a slight net GWP benefit of -70 kg CO2/ton. Depending on the pyrolysis technologies used, the net GWP benefit can be lower than that of a fossil-based energy system. As reported, replacing fossil fuels with bio-oil yields a net GWP range between −0.6 to 2.9 kg CO2/L (Lijó et al., 2014). In other examples, the application of synthetic biofuels obtained from poplar wood pyrolysis results in lower GWP values than fossil fuels (i.e., 54.4% lower) [324]. Similarly, up to 70% reduction in GWP values was observed when using bio-oil obtained from pine trees over residual fuel oil [325]. Several factors influencing the GWP range include pyrolysis technologies, energy demand, and bio-oil yields. Considering these varying factors, evaluating GWP benefits yielded from different pyrolysis technologies needs to be done on an individual basis and guided by the conservative principles set by the ISO life cycle assessment regulations. Taking into account the incomplete knowledge on the benefits of carbon storage and sustainability aspects of biochar application, researchers caution the interpretation and dissemination of GWP results. Particularly, GWP reported in recent studies is mainly based on results obtained from laboratory models or small-scale studies, such as bench and pilot-scale. Therefore, scaling up pyrolysis operation for commercial plants may not yield similar results. Sourcing and production of feedstock are primary factors that directly affect the GWP of pyrolysis products."
22,Economic assessment of biomass pyrolysis,"Despite the positive environmental values brought by biofuel, issues surrounding production cost and overall competitiveness to traditional fossil fuels remain the biggest obstacles in finding market opportunities for pyrolysis technologies. Table 11 provides a list of different fuels obtained from pyrolysis products and respective life cycle costs, which depend on a wide range of variables such as feedstock costs, product yields and values, production scale and capacity, and life expectancy of manufacturing plant, and discount rates. These types of cost can be grouped in terms of both fixed cost (installation costs, depreciation of assets, labor and maintenance-related costs, and interest rates charged on investment) and variable cost (feedstock cost based on prices and quantity, transportation cost overhead costs including utilities and waste disposal, among others) [281,321]. Successful commercialization of pyrolysis technologies hinges on whether such applications prove to be profitable, which depends heavily on the above-mentioned factors and the availability of supporting policy and financial incentives for the production and consumption of biofuels and other types of renewable energy [326,327]. As seen in Table 11, the prices of feedstock can range anywhere between $50 to $97/ton and make up approximately 30−54% of the liquid fuel production cost, which can be concluded from the above table with the given cost of biomass and product. Feedstock costs are determined on the methods used in its production, including sourcing, collection, and processing of the raw materials and related transportation costs. There are examples of studies on the economics of biomass energy production found in the current literature. Production costs are lower for agricultural residues (i.e., rice straw) than energy crops, as reported by Kung and Zhang [334] Furthermore, costs associated with the transportation of feedstock and intermediate products play an important role in determining the overall production costs of liquid fuels [335]. There are different feedstock price ranges in which fuel production using slow and fast pyrolysis processes can still be profitable. Brown et al. [336] confirmed that feedstock prices could be as high as $83 per dry ton in slow pyrolysis to $64/ton in both fast and slow pyrolysis, of which fast pyrolysis is found to be more profitable in the latter case [334]. Besides feedstock costs, other important factors in driving the life cycle costs of pyrolysis fuels are technologies and product yield. The quality and yield of the upgraded bio-oil product, catalyst cost [322], and catalyst lifespan [337] are equally important factors that should be taken into account when performing production economic analysis. Additionally, the yield of liquid fuels obtained from corn stover pyrolysis was found to have strong influence on the overall competitiveness of the liquid products intended for use as transportation fuels, regardless of the use purposes (i.e., production of electricity and heat) of other pyrolysis co-products [332,336]. A few pyrolysis products have higher economic values than others. In Kung et al. [321] investigation on poplar wood pyrolysis, the researchers revealed that fast pyrolysis is more advantageous in terms of profit-making than slow pyrolysis due to the former process producing higher economic value bio-oil over biochar. Bio-oil can further be used to generate higher-value products such as electricity. Nikolaidis and Poullikkas [338] also hinted at the economic viability of large-scale pyrolyzer applications in producing high-value products such as hydrogen. The step of converting pyrolysis co-products into those with higher values can help to improve the overall profitability of the pyrolysis process [327,339]. The above assumption might hold true for some pyrolysis chemicals; however, it has also been pointed out that Kraft lignin-derived chemicals cannot compete with their fossil-fuel-based counterparts in terms of profitability due to the former feedstock’s inhibitive cost of $500/ton [326]."
23,Technical orientation and logistics for the future development of biomass pyrolysis,"An important approach in improving the profitability of pyrolysis fuel production is by scaling up production capacity [327,339]. The large-scale operation can reduce overall costs by lowering fixed per-unit costs, yet variable costs might increase due to an increase in inventory costs. To overcome this negative effect and increase the cost effectiveness of large-scale biofuel production, operations can be arranged so that production activities are in close proximity to the biomass sources, therefore minimizing the transportation costs. With advances made in pyrolysis conversion efficiencies, the related economic and environmental performance of biofuel production will be improved. Another approach is to leverage on the use of mobile pyrolysis systems due to their ease of installation near the feedstock source. The high mobility of such systems enables its movement across different biomass distribution sites and can cover a potentially large geographic area. The collection and processing of this highly dispersed amount of biomass can yield extra benefits to the regional forest ecosystems by reducing the risk of wildfires. Examining the issue from the logistics angle, higher transportation costs are associated with increased difficulties in handling and transporting of raw biomass materials as compared to final pyrolysis products [340]. By moving the production sites closer to the biomass sources and then transporting the yielded bio-oil to central power plants by a distance of between 100 and 500 km, the transportation costs are significantly reduced and deemed a much better alternative than transporting the raw biomass materials [341,342]. In addition, the decentralized approach to bioenergy production, in which the pretreatment process occurs at or near the source of biomass [343], offers several important advantages in terms of the overall efficiency of the biomass supply chain and production capacity of the biofuel production process. The role of the pretreatment process is to convert the raw biomass into biofuel precursors and other value-added chemicals through various thermochemical pretreatment processes. Some of the biofuel precursors can include soluble sugars/carbohydrates, major biomass components (hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin, minerals, and other organic volatile materials), torrefied biomass pellets, bio-oil, and biochar products. Interestingly, the hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass can offer alternative means of transporting liquid form of biomass through pipelines and on tanker ships similar to those used for crude oils. This can potentially offer important benefits to various stakeholders in the bioenergy industry. For farmers, agricultural residues can be used as feedstock in the pyrolysis process for the production of biofuel and biomaterial, which offer important financial gains. The development of remote biomass pretreatment centers among rural farming communities present not only develops new employment opportunities for the local population but also valuable infrastructure investment prospects to the regional economy. Furthermore, the economics of biorefineries operations and pyrolytic production of biofuel are further enhanced by the availability of resulting precursors from the pyrolysis process. The quality of precursors (i.e., its purity and energy density) produced from the various decentralized pretreatment centers is controlled to ensure it meets the specific requirements for each biorefinery; hence, eliminating the additional costs incurred during the extra pretreatment and detoxification step taken place at the biorefineries sites [50]. Key adjustments made to reactor configurations can significantly improve current pyrolysis technologies in terms of their efficiency and effectiveness. Particularly, by improving the heat transfer and boosting the pyrolysis reactions within the reactor, one can improve the quality of bio-oil produced (i.e., bio-oil with a lower fraction of molecular weights and level of acidity [344], thus improving its thermal stability). The collection of ash among the bed materials is a common occurrence in the pyrolysis of biomass materials with high alkali metal content, which can negatively affect the bio-oil yield. The combination of optimized temperature control and heating rate with the use of small particle size has been shown to be effective in minimizing agglomeration [218,345]. One study, in particular, has recently proposed the use of a novel ablative reactor in processing whole wood chips and rods in the pyrolysis process. The technology will effectively eliminate the additional energy spent on grinding up the initial feedstock materials if it is successfully implemented [346]. Recently, efforts have been put forward in finding effective solutions to optimize the catalytic pyrolysis process. One of the proposals is the replacement of catalysts [337] over sand, minerals, among others which are commonly used as bed materials [31,347]. Researching the next-generation catalysts that are more effectiveness in terms of its robustness and thermal stability can help to improve the performance and energy efficiency of the pyrolysis process. Consequently, it can further improve the quality of bio-oil by effectively limiting the presence of oxygen-containing groups in the liquid product [275,348]. Calcium oxide and acidic catalysts have shown positive effects on the catalyst application in the pyrolysis process. In one study, the use of oxide catalyst is confirmed to promote pyrolysis reactivity and absorb carbon dioxide to produce calcium carbonate [275]. The resulting calcium carbonate can be easily extracted from the bio-oil and biochar product and is readily repurposed. On the other hand, the use of acidic catalysts is proven to be more effective than base catalysts in breaking up grass-type biomass during fast pyrolysis [349] due to its ability to increase the rate of pyrolysis reactions and shorten carbon chain length [350]. Catalytic steam reforming is another promising catalytic application to improve the pyrolysis process. The reactions involved in the catalytic-present steam reforming of bio-oil facilitate the conversion of bio-oil into more valuable products such as industry-grade chemicals and transportation fuels, including gasoline, diesel, jet fuel [3,274,351]. The combining of both catalytic steam reforming and a water-gas shift reaction can turn pyrolysis-obtained syngas into hydrogen [337]. Even though there are still several shortcomings to the catalytic pyrolysis process (i.e., collection of carbon and mineral inside the reactor [351], they are overcome by the potential in yielding higher value products. Co-pyrolysis of biomass is a process in which two or more materials are used as feedstock. The use of the co-pyrolysis approach can improve the properties and yield of bio-oil. Co-pyrolysis also contributes to lower production costs and provides a possible solution for waste management [352] which in turn can yield positive environmental benefits [353]. Brebu et al. [119] provided the evidence in supporting this conclusion when demonstrating the co-pyrolysis of pine cones and waste polymer, which boosted bio-oil yield from 48 to 70 wt%. They also observed an improvement in bio-oil quality. Last but not least, integrated biomass fast pyrolysis and gasification, turning it into a combined heat and power plant, is another promising alternative that could make pyrolysis more attractive for wider commercial application [354] and as an environmental-friendly approach to energy production. Specifically, regarding the latter point of the above statement, a life cycle assessment modeling of an integrated pyrolysis system that is capable of bio-oil production and electricity generation showed an impressive reduction in CO2 emissions (72–99%) compared to conventional fossil-based methods of electricity production [170,355]. Moreover, a separated reactor configuration containing a multi-stage compressor and stripper could be easily retrofitted into existing pyrolysis reactors without much additional cost as part of the bio-oil upgrading process [356]. The newly integrated pyrolysis system provides greater flexibility and enhances the quality, economic values, commercialization potential of pyrolysis products. Stepwise pyrolysis is a pyrolysis process that involves more than one temperature step at which a different product can be obtained separately based on the differences in temperatures required for decomposition of major biomass components, namely cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin [357,358]. Stepwise pyrolysis has shown to be effective as a fractional condensation method of pyrolysis vapors. As demonstrated by [358], there are positive gains in applying the stepwise method in corncob pyrolysis, including higher quality of liquid outputs and greater control in the selection of value-added compounds in the resulting pyrolytic products. Specifically, in the first step of the process, acetic acid (also known as ethanoic acid), furfural, and phenolic compounds (4-vinylphenol and 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol) could be obtained, while the collection of hydrocarbons was gained in the second step. Furthermore, the application of staged cooling and condensing of pyrolysis volatiles with the use of two or more condensers at distinct temperatures is an effective strategy in improving bio-oil quality [359,360]. Integrating polygeneration systems in biomass pyrolysis is an innovative approach that has gain traction in recent years [361,362]. The process provides efficient utilization of all pyrolysis products, including bio-oil, biogas, and biochar) through optimization of the thermochemical conversion. In their study of pyrolysis polygeneration system of cotton stalk on a laboratory scale, Chen et al. [363] showed that bio-oil yield of 30 wt% with a high concentration of furans and phenols was obtained at an optimal temperature range between 550 and 750 °C. Under the same condition, the experiment yielded approximately 30 wt% of solid biochar with approximately 28 MJ/kg in calorific value and equally high-calorific-value biogas (8−9 MJ/m3). In a different study, Zhang et al. [358] revealed positive gains in the production of high-value products from pyrolysis polygeneration of poplar chip and bamboo in a moving bed reactor. A wide range of studies covering different aspects of biomass pyrolysis technology, from reactor configuration and heating source to single and poly-step pyrolysis process, have been carried out in the search for solutions in optimizing the current technologies. Further research direction could aim to examine the combined effect from the integration of these different technologies on the overall pyrolysis process. Specifically, attention is needed in analyzing the economic viability of these different technologies in finding the best technical solution for producing bio-oil."
24,Conclusion,"The valorization of lignocellulosic biomass via pyrolysis has been proven to be a promising route for renewable energy generation. This study presents a comprehensive review on the effects of key pyrolysis parameters on the product distribution and mechanism. Pyrolysis process conditions such as temperature, heating rate, pressure, and residence time, as well as the quality and composition of biomass feedstock, highly influence on the output yield distribution and physio-chemical properties of the final biofuel production. High bio-oil yields are commonly found in the pyrolysis of woody biomass. The bio-oil produced from low-temperature pyrolysis mainly contained alkanes, aliphatic nitriles, amides, esters, and long-chain fatty acids while high-pyrolysis temperatures are conducive to the cracking of aliphatic species and the formation of aromatics. In summary, by understanding the pyrolysis mechanisms, the selection of suitable pyrolysis conditions and feedstocks can optimize the desired biofuel fraction and produce high-quality bio-oil. Future work should focus on the advanced biomass conversion technique to lower the overall production cost of biofuel."
