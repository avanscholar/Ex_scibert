0,Introduction,"Packaging materials protect foods against mechanical damage, chemical agents and microbiological activity. Packaging plays an important role in preservation, distribution and marketing of foodstuff extending the shelf-life (Falguera, Quintero, Jiménez, Muñoz, & Ibarz, 2011; Giuggioli, Girgenti, Briano, & Peano, 2017). Most of the food packaging materials are synthetic, petrochemical based plastics. They have low cost and have good mechanical properties, heat sealing capability and act as a barrier to gases and aroma compounds (Tharanathan, 2003). Nowadays, consumers are aware of environmental problems. Biodegradable polymeric compounds are an alternative to synthetic polymers for food packaging, as they are abundant and renewable (Cazón, Velazquez, Ramírez, & Vázquez, 2017). Moreover, these polymers are biodegradable and edible allowing a direct use as food coating. They can also provide adequate barrier to moisture, oxygen and solute movement (Bourtoom, 2008). Among natural polymers, cellulose constitutes the most abundant renewable resource available. Cellulose can be isolated from wood, cotton, hemp and other plant-based materials. Plants produce over ten billion of tons of cellulose per year globally, making this polysaccharide the largest organic carbon reservoir. Therefore, cellulose is considered an almost inexhaustible source of raw materials for food packaging (Wang, Lu, & Zhang, 2016; Xu, Chen, Rosswurm, Yao, & Janaswamy, 2016). Cellulose is a linear chain with two anhydroglucose rings covalently linked through an oxygen in a β14 glycosidic bond (Wang et al., 2016). Due to its crystallinity, cellulose is not soluble in water, restricting its potential applications. For example, the use of cellulose as the basis of biodegradable films instead of using cellulose as a reinforcing agent in films based on another polymer (Fernandes et al., 2010; Khan et al., 2012; Roohani et al., 2008). In addition, due to the insolubility of cellulose, derivatives have been used to develop biodegradable films (Park, Weller, Vergano, & Testin, 1993; Shivakumara & Demappa, 2016). Recently, several methods have been developed to dissolve cellulose as a previous step for film production, which allows the development of biodegradable cellulose-based films, more than only uses cellulose as a reinforcing agent. These methods could use solvents like tetrabutylammonium fluoride/dimethyl sulfoxide system, N-methylmorpholine N-oxide, ionic liquids, NaOH aqueous solution, LiCl/N,N-dimethylacetamide, NaOH/urea, NaOH/thiourea aqueous solution and other more complex solutions like aqueous metal solutions composed of transition metal ions and nitrous ligands (Isik, Sardon, & Mecerreyes, 2014; Lindman, Karlström, & Stigsson, 2010; Wang et al., 2016). On the other hand, cellulose-based films still has some disadvantages, such as poor mechanical properties (Almeida, Frollini, Castellan, & Coma, 2010). Some effective strategies to improve the mechanical performance include the combination of cellulose with other biodegradable polymers or the addition of plasticizers. It allows improving film properties meanwhile maintaining biodegradability. Plasticizers are non-volatile compounds usually of low molecular weight. The low molecular size of a plasticizer allows occupying intermolecular spaces between polymeric chains. This changes the three-dimensional molecular organization of polymers, reducing the energy required for molecular motion and the formation of hydrogen bonding between chains. As a consequence, an increase in the free volume and the molecular mobility is observed (Vieira, Da Silva, Dos Santos, & Beppu, 2011). The most commonly used plasticizers are polyols, mono-, di- and oligosaccharides. Polyols are particularly effective for plasticizing hydrophilic polymers. Glycerol has been systematically incorporated in most of the hydrocolloid-based films (Vieira et al., 2011). Thus, adding glycerol can reduce brittleness and increase flexibility. On the other hand, glycerol can also have a negative effect increasing film permeability (Shivakumara & Demappa, 2016). Composite polymers could offer a simple and relatively inexpensive method to develop new materials. Mixing a brittle polymer with a rubbery one may result in a material with good rigidity and toughness (Morgado, Frollini, Castellan, Rosa, & Coma, 2011a). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a polymer suitable for mixing with cellulose to change mechanical properties of the composite film. Besides, it is easily soluble in water, non-toxicity and biodegradable (Frone, Nicolae, Gabor, & Panaitescu, 2015; Wahyuningsih, Iriani, & Fahma, 2016). Mechanical properties of films are important to ensure integrity during transportation, handling and storage of packaged foods (Rouhi, Razavi, & Mousavi, 2017). Mechanical properties including toughness, burst strength and distance to burst (maximum deformation) depend on film composition and components properties (Vieira et al., 2011). Measurement of these properties allows predicting how the material will behave under different food processing conditions and comparing the performance with other polymers. Water adsorption is important because packaging films should maintain moisture levels in a packaged product. This property indicates the swelling capacity of the film in contact with food, liquids, or during storage at high relative humidity. Water adsorption capacity can affect the mechanical properties of films. On the other hand, water adsorption can be useful for some applications, for example, as adsorbent pads in food packaging (Cha & Chinnan, 2004). The presence of micropores in the structure of some biopolymers, like cellulose, and the combination with plasticizers and other hydrophilic polymers are relevant to the swelling capacity (El Seoud, Fidale, Ruiz, D’Almeida, & Frollini, 2008; Han, 2014; Leceta, Guerrero, & De La Caba, 2013; Zhang & Han, 2008). The barrier properties to ultraviolet radiation (UV) of films are an important parameter. UV radiation is responsible for the oxidation of lipids. This oxidation leads to the appearance of undesirable flavours and odours, decreasing the shelf life of packaged foods. Hence, an appropriate formulation of the biodegradable films with barrier properties against the UV light can help to slow the oxidation process of the lipids (Guo, Ge, Li, Mu, & Li, 2014). Morever, an important parameter of optical properties is the transparency because it has a direct impact on the consumer acceptability. A transparent packaging allows the consumer to easily view the product content to judge its visual quality (Imran et al., 2012). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) is a useful way to study the molecular structure. The width and intensity of the peaks are sensitive to the environment and conformation of macromolecules at the molecular level, the combinations of polymers could produce intermolecular interactions, resulting in changes in the FTIR spectra (Xiao, Zhang, Zhang, Lu, & Zhang, 2003). The aim of this study was to evaluate biodegradable composite films obtained from mixtures of cellulose, glycerol and PVA. Polynomial models were obtained to describe the effect of the mixture on functional properties like toughness, burst strength, distance to burst and water adsorption. Light barrier properties, transparency, structure by scanning electron microscopy and spectroscopy analysis (FT-IR and UV–VIS-NIR), and thermal properties of films by differential scanning calorimetry were also evaluated."
1,Materials and methods,"Microcrystalline cellulose, extra pure (average particle size 90 μm), urea 99.5% for analysis, sodium hydroxide 98% and sodium bromide 99% extra pure anhydrous and acetic acid 99.5% were purchased from Acros organics (Geel, Belgium). Polyvinyl alcohol full hydrolysed, was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, US). Glycerol was purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA, US)."
2,Preparation of films,"2.1 Preparation of films The NaOH/Urea method was used for dissolving cellulose (Cai & Zhang, 2006). The process is shown in Fig. 1 . Films were prepared following a modified method (Cai & Zhang, 2006). Briefly, an aqueous solution containing NaOH:urea:H2O (7:14:79 w/w) was used as solvent for cellulose. Desired amount of cellulose, 3–4% (w/w) of total weight solvent solution (17–23 g of cellulose per 570 g of solvent solution), was dispersed in the solvent at room temperature. The mixture was vigorously stirred during 1 h. Cellulose suspension was frozen at −20 °C for 24 h. Then, the mixture was thawed at room temperature stirring vigorously during 1 h to obtain a transparent solution. Desired glycerol concentration (2.5% w/w or 5% w/w) was added stirring vigorously during 1 h until a homogeneous solution was obtained. A defined volume of 30 ml was cast in Petri dish to a 0.5 cm thick layer, and then immersed in a coagulation bath of acetic acid (4% v/v) for regeneration. The resulting wet films were washed with running distilled water until pH 7. The wet films were immersed in a PVA bath for 1 h. The PVA bath was prepared by dissolving PVA in water to obtain a final concentration of 2%, 5% or 10% (w/w) Finally, the film was dried in a Petri dish at room temperature for 2 days. The dried film was peeled from the plates and samples were cut to a specific size and stored in desiccators for 5 days at 51 or 0% RH as needed for each test."
3,Film thickness measurement,"2.2 Film thickness measurement Thickness (mm) of films was measured using a thickness meter ET115S (Etari GmbH, Stuttgart, Germany) at 5 locations of each film and average values were reported. Thickness was measured prior to characterization tests."
4,Mechanical properties,"2.3 Mechanical properties A texturometer (TA-XTplus, Stable Micro System, UK) was used to measure mechanical properties. Toughness was measured following the standard method ASTM D-882 (https://www.astm.org/Standards/D882.htm). An initial grip separation of 40 mm and crosshead speed of 50 mm/min were set up. Ten samples of 15 × 100 mm, were cut from each film formulation and stored in desiccators at 51% RH for 5 days at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C). Both ends of the films were fixed using mechanical grips and the strength was measured. The toughness of a material is the capability to absorb energy and plastically deform without fracturing. Thus it is the amount of energy per unit volume that a material can absorb before rupturing (Rouhi et al., 2017). Toughness was calculated as the area under stress – strain curve per specimen volume, following Eq. (1) (Budi Santosa & Padua, 1999). (1) T = E n e r g y V o l u m e n = ∫ 0 ε f σ d ε Burst strength (BS) and distance to burst (DB) were calculated from puncture test. Puncture test determines the film strength to penetration of a cylindrical probe at constant speed and the distance at the breaking point (Spotti, Cecchini, Spotti, & Carrara, 2016). Fig. 2 shows a diagram of this measure. Four squares of each film of 30 mm side were obtained and stored in desiccators at 51% RH for 5 days at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C). The sample was fixed to a film support rig (HDP/FSR), and compressed at 60 mm/min until rupture (Spotti et al., 2016)."
5,Water adsorption,"2.4 Water adsorption Water adsorption was determined by the gravimetric method. Three samples of each film were cut into 3 × 3 cm squares and stored in desiccators with silica gel for 5 days at 20 ± 1 °C. Dry samples (Wdry) were weighed in analytical balance with 0.1 mg resolution. Each sample was immersed in a closed container with 100 ml of distilled water and stored at 20 ± 1 °C for 24 h to allow samples reaching equilibrium. Then the excess surface water was removed from swollen films with aid of filter paper. Immediately, wet film samples were weighed and moisture content (%W) of films was calculated using equation 2. (2) % W = W w e t − W d r y W d r y · 100 Where Wwet is the wet weight and Wdry is the dried weight. Each test was performed by triplicate."
6,Scanning electron microscopy,"2.5 Scanning electron microscopy Film surfaces and sectional views were examined by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Films samples were coated on slides with adhesive carbon tape and metalized with gold and observed with a high-vacuum microscope (JEOL JSM-6360LV, Jeol Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV."
7,Light barrier properties and transparency,"2.6 Light barrier properties and transparency The ultraviolet and visible light barrier properties of the film were analysed in a spectrophotometer V-670 (Jasco Inc, Japan) using transmittance mode at 2 nm intervals in UV–VIS-NIR regions (190 nm–2500 nm). The transparency of the films was calculated from the percent transmittance of light at 600 nm, following the Eq. (3) (Han & Floros, 1997): (3) Transparency = (log%T600)/x Where %T600 is the percent transmittance at 600 nm and x is the film thickness (mm). Two replicates of each treatment were tested."
8,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,"2.7 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy FT-IR ABB Bomen 102 (ABB Ltd, Zurich Switzerland) equipped with a Universal Attenuated Total Reflectance (UATR) accessory SPECAC Golden Gate with diamond crystal was used to collect the FTIR spectra of the films. Samples were conditioned at relative humidity of 65 ± 2% and 21 ± 1 °C for at least 48 h prior to the test. FTIR spectra were collected at a spectral resolution of 4 cm−1 over the range from 400 to 4000 cm−1."
9,Thermal properties of films,"2.8 Thermal properties of films The thermal stability of the developed films was analysed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) using a Q1000 equipment (TA instruments, New Castle, DE, USA). The samples were conditioned in hermetic aluminium pans, with a sample weight around 2–4 mg. The test was carried out at a heating rate of 10 °C/min from 50 to 400 °C, in inter atmosphere of N2 (50 ml/min)."
10,Statistical design and analysis,"2.9 Statistical design and analysis Cellulose, glycerol and polyvinyl alcohol concentration was considered as operational variable (denoted A, B and C, respectively) and the effect on the select dependent variable (T, BS, DB, and %W) was calculated. The set of experiments followed the Box–Behnken design, a second-order, incomplete, factorial design (Box & Behnken, 1960). The experiment design was statistically analysed using the Design Expert® 10.0.6 software (Stat-Ease, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). The model was validated through multifactor analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. Differences between mean values in the experiments were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Cooḱs distance was applied the detect outliers (Cook, 1977)."
11,Results and discussion,"NaOH/Urea solution was used to dissolve cellulose. NaOH/urea system is less expensive and less toxic for the environment than other usual solvents. NMMO/H2O system seems to be the most powerful as it dissolves highly concentrate solutions. However, it requires elevated temperature for dissolution. NaOH/urea system requires low temperatures for the dissolution of cellulose (Morgado et al., 2011a). Composite films were prepared using cellulose, glycerol and polyvinyl alcohol at several levels following the experimental design showed in Table 1 . Cellulose ranged from 3 to 4% (w/w), glycerol ranged from 0 to 5% (w/w) because glycerol concentration over 5% destabilized cellulose solution. A minimum concentration of PVA 2% (w/w) was stablished to avoid rupture of films during drying. Therefore, PVA ranged from 2 to 10% (w/w). The results of dependent variables (T, BS, DB and %W) are also shown in Table 1. The relationship between independent (cellulose, glycerol and polyvinyl alcohol) and dependent variables (T, BS, DB and %W) of the films was modelled using polynomial equations. Samples of experiment 1, 2 and 13 were measured by SEM, UV–VIS-NIR, FTIR and DSC, to analyse how the variation of glycerol and PVA content affects the morphological, optical, structural and thermal properties of the films. The average thickness of films was 0.0633 mm."
12,Effect on toughness (T),"3.1 Effect on toughness (T) Films obtained showed values of toughness in the range of 0.25–44.30 MJ/m3. Experimental data fitted well to a quadratic model. Experiment 10 was ignored because it was detected as an outliner. The multifactor analysis of variance (ANOVA) is shown in Table 2 . F-value was 61.03 (p-value <0.0006) implying that the model was significant. The value of r2 was 0.9928, and the adequate precision obtained was 23.89 indicating an adequate signal. The evaluation of F-values of the three variables confirmed that toughness was highly affected by the linear effect of PVA concentration and the interaction cellulose-glycerol, followed by the quadratic terms of PVA concentration and the interaction glycerol-PVA. Eq. (4) predicts the response of toughness (T). (4) T = 65.18 − 43.48 C e l l u l o s e ( % ) − 1.36 G l y c e r o l ( % ) − 7.99 P V A ( % ) + 0.52 C e l l u l o s e ( % ) · G l y c e r o l ( % ) − 2.53 C e l l u l o s e ( % ) · P V A ( % ) − 0.32 G l y c e r o l · P V A + 7.12 C e l l u l o s e ( % ) 2 + 0.07 G l y c e r o l ( % ) 2 + 0.32 P V A ( % ) 2 The response surface describing the effect of the concentration of cellulose, glycerol and polyvinyl alcohol on toughness is shown in Fig. 3 . Increasing PVA concentration increases toughness values, reaching higher toughness values at lower concentrations of cellulose (from 0.30 to 10.55 MJ/m3 with the increase of PVA concentration). PVA plays a plasticizer role enhancing toughness of the developed films. This behaviour agrees with the formation of links between chains of cellulose and PVA that allowed the sliding of the polymer chains during the mechanical test, thus improving the capability to absorb energy and plastically deform without fracturing of the film. However, the value of toughness decreases when increasing glycerol concentration (from 23.41 to 10.55 MJ/m3). Other authors have reported similar results in synthetic polymers (Lourdin, Bizot, & Colonna, 1996) or tapioca starch films (Chang, Abd Karim, & Seow, 2006) where the glycerol showed a negative effect on toughness values. The presence of small amounts of glycerol produced a competition for hydrogen bonds between polymer‐polymer and polymer‐plasticizer. The interaction cellulose-glycerol reduced the direct interaction among cellulose chains, reducing toughness properties (Chang et al., 2006). The values of toughness obtained are comparable to those of PVA films reinforced with glycerol, bacterial cellulose nanocrystal and boric acid. In this work, values of 43.15 or 94.11 MJ/m3 were found for the highest or lowest concentration of glycerol, respectively. Glycerol had a negative effect on films toughness at concentrations higher than 20% (Rouhi et al., 2017). On the other hand, composite films of nanofibrillated cellulose, cationic hydroxyethylcellulose and glycerol showed lower values of toughness. The maximum value obtained of all combinations was 16.9 MJ/m3 (Spoljaric, Salminen, Luong, & Seppälä, 2015). Using the model obtained in our work, it is possible to select the right formulation to obtain films with any toughness into the range of study."
13,Effect on burst strength (BS),"3.2 Effect on burst strength (BS) Films showed values of burst strength in the range from 1395 to 12014 g. Experimental data fitted well to a linear model. The multifactor analysis of variance (ANOVA) is shown in Table 2. The F-value was 9.50 (p-value <0.0022) implying that the model was significant. The value of r2 was 0.7216, and the adequate precision value was 7.960, indicating an adequate signal. F-values of variables indicate that the linear effect of PVA concentration is the only significant term. Therefore, burst strength was only affected by the linear effect of the PVA concentration. Equation 5 predicts the response on burst strength (BS) using real values for the components of the mixture. (5) BS = − 2717.18 + 892.46 Cellulose ( % ) − 100.73 Glycerol ( % ) + 981.39 PVA ( % ) The response surface obtained after evaluating the effect of the concentration of cellulose, glycerol and polyvinyl alcohol on burst strength of films is shown in Fig. 4 . As predicted, the value of burst strength increases as the PVA concentration increases, being minor the variations suffered by the value of burst strength depending on the concentration of cellulose and glycerol. The burst strength values obtained from films with the highest concentration of PVA were eight times higher than the values obtained for films with 2% PVA. This behaviour is probably due to the plasticizing effect of PVA as it combines easily with several polymers increasing the mechanical properties of the composites (Frone et al., 2015; Wahyuningsih et al., 2016). Adding PVA increased the thickness, causing an increase of the burst strength values of films. On the other hand, values of burst strength were lower for films with higher concentrations of glycerol and lower concentrations of PVA probably due to incompatibility of glycerol with cellulose, affecting negatively the mechanical properties. Furthermore, increasing the cellulose proportion in the composite resulted in low values of burst strength, probably due to the cellulose crystallinity. Therefore, brittle films were obtained when the cellulose concentration increases. Although the variations on burst strength values due to glycerol and cellulose were negligible in comparison with the effect of PVA. Similar effect of adding PVA was also observed in films based on carboxymethyl cellulose with polyvinyl alcohol (Muppalla, Kanatt, Chawla, & Sharma, 2014). The values of burst strength (called puncture force in the cited reference) of carboxymethyl cellulose with PVA were in range of 0.9–3.9 N, lower than the burst strength values of the regenerated cellulose films with PVA reported in a range of 13.7–117.8 N (Muppalla et al., 2014). The values obtained were also higher than the reported values of kefiran–whey protein with nanoparticle incorporation of montmorillonite and nano-TiO2, with burst strength values between 1.8 and 4.5 N (Zolfi, Khodaiyan, Mousavi, & Hashemi, 2014). Pea starch based films with guar gum reported BS values in the range of 6.9–37.7 N (Saberi et al., 2016). BS values reported of kefiran films with chitosan addition were from 6.49 to 18.94 N (Sabaghi, Maghsoudlou, & Habibi, 2015). Thus, the films developed of cellulose with glycerol and PVA showed higher burst strength values than the average values obtained in the other types of biodegradable films. On the other hand, the plasticizing effect of glycerol increasing the values of burst strength in hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose films has been reported. In contrast, adding glycerol up to 30% had no significant effect on the burst strength of chitosan films (Leceta et al., 2013; Shivakumara & Demappa, 2016)."
14,Effect on distance to burst (DB),"3.3 Effect on distance to burst (DB) When packed product has protuberances, films should have good uniaxial mechanical properties in order to maintain integrity (Leceta et al., 2013). The films obtained showed values of distance to burst in the range from 1.60 to 6.04 mm. Experimental data fitted well to a linear model. Experiment 12 was ignored because it was detected as an outliner. The multifactor analysis of variance (ANOVA) is shown in Table 2. F-value was 8.60 (p-value <0.0040) implying that the model was significant. The value of r2 was 0.7207, and the adequate precision value was 7.304, indicating an adequate signal. Evaluating the F-values of variables, only the linear effect of the PVA concentration is a significant model term. Like in the case of BS, distance to burst was only affected by the linear effect of the PVA concentration. Equation 6 predicts the response on distance to burst (DB) using real values for the components of the mixture. (6) D B = 0.65 + 0.11 C e l l u l o s e ( % ) − 0.03 G l y c e r o l ( % ) + 0.39 P V A ( % ) The response surface for the effect of concentration of cellulose, glycerol and polyvinyl alcohol on distance to burst of films is shown in Fig. 5 . As predicted, the value of distance to burst increases as PVA concentration increases. This was due to the plasticizing effect of PVA because it combines with other polymers and modifies the mechanical properties of the composite (Frone et al., 2015; Wahyuningsih et al., 2016). The distance to burst values obtained for cellulose films are similar to values reported for other biodegradable films, i.e. brea gum films with beeswax and glycerol had values of distance to burst or maximum deformation from 3 to 4.5 mm (Spotti et al., 2016). Films made from kefiran–whey protein containing nanoparticle of montmorillonite and nano-TiO2 showed values in the range of 8–12 mm meanwhile pea starch based films with guar gum had DB values in the range from 2.66 to 9.93 mm (Saberi et al., 2016; Zolfi et al., 2014)."
15,Effect on water adsorption (%W),"3.4 Effect on water adsorption (%W) Fig. 7 shows the appearance of the wet film compared with the dry films. Films showed values of %W in the range from 136.35 to 222.09%. Experimental data fitted well to a linear model. Experiment 10 was ignored because it was detected as an outliner. The multifactor analysis of variance (ANOVA) is shown in Table 2. F-value was 18.47 (p-value <0.0002) implying that the model was significant. The value of r2 was 0.8471, and the adequate precision was 13.138, indicating an adequate signal. Eq. (7) predicts the response of %W: (7) % W = 45.12 + 29.95 · C e l l u l o s e ( % ) − 3.65 · G l y c e r o l ( % ) + 7.37 · P V A ( % ) The response surface describing the effect of the concentrations of cellulose, glycerol and PVA on %W is shown in Fig. 6 . The value of %W increases when increasing PVA concentration, with no significant variations in the %W, as a function of the concentration of cellulose and glycerol. Cellulose polymers have a high crystalline structure inaccessible to water molecules, but also have a paracrystalline or amorphous region to which water molecules can gain access, thus making them hydrophilic. Furthermore, crystallinity of microcrystalline cellulose (used to obtain regenerated cellulose) is higher than that of pre-treated cellulose, because of the partial removal of amorphous regions (Bedane, Eić, Farmahini-Farahani, & Xiao, 2015). For that reason, the results obtained in the present work showed that the interval of concentration of cellulose studied did not affect the water adsorption probably due to high crystallinity. Fig. 7 shows the appearance of the films wet or dry. Results from cellulose films without glycerol and the lowest concentration of PVA are comparable to other studies. Films based on regenerated cellulose from high cellulose pulp of steam-exploded sugarcane bagasse showed values of adsorbed water in a similar range from 50 to 72.24% as a function of steam temperature and coagulation time (Phinichka & Kaenthong, 2016). A value of 90.02% in adsorbed water was reported for films with 8% of cellulose and prepared by ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride. In the present study, films containing 3.5% of cellulose without glycerol and the lowest concentration of PVA showed an adsorbed water of 66%. Difference between studies can be due to the difference of cellulose concentration and dissolving method, which could affect the final properties of cellulose films (Mahmoudian, Wahit, Ismail, & Yussuf, 2012). On the other hand, glycerol is a highly polar molecule with a strong attraction to water promoting entrapment of large amount of water molecules inside the polymer network (Zhang & Han, 2008). But in the present study, glycerol did not show a significant effect on the %W. Probably due to the low concentration or the superficial layer of PVA that covered the film. PVA has an important hydrophilic character showing a more significant effect on the %W values than glycerol, although the two compound are hydrophilic (Wahyuningsih et al., 2016). This affinity of glycerol and PVA for water was also observed in films from soy protein isolate blended with PVA and plasticized with glycerol (Su et al., 2010). Films from wheat gluten changed water affinity as a function of the proportion of glycerol and hydrophobic liquid (Song & Zheng, 2008). Also, chitosan films were plasticized with glycerol, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol (Han, 2014)."
16,Scanning electron microscopy,"3.5 Scanning electron microscopy The films were analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 8 shows the surface and a lateral view of films obtained in experiments 1, 2 and 13. The films are opaque during preparation but became translucent after drying. The surface structure of films was a homogeneous internal matrix, indicating a dense structure. The reinforcing effect of glycerol can be observed comparing experiments 1 and 2. It can be observed an increase in thickness caused by PVA in experiment 13. This agrees with the measured toughness and burst strength values. The increase in the concentration of PVA softens the surface of the film, decreasing the roughness and leaving a surface free of possible pores."
17,Light barrier properties and transparency,"3.6 Light barrier properties and transparency It is important to pay attention to the oxidation of lipids due to UV light in the range of 200–280 nm, because it is one of common oxidation initiators in food systems (Guo et al., 2014). The transmittance of light in the range of UV, visible light and near infrared at selected wavelengths at 190 nm and 2500 nm of the cellulose-based films is shown in Fig. 9 . The absorptions in the range 190–400 nm (UV region) is higher in the films with the high level of glycerol (5%) and the low level of PVA (2%) (experiment 1). Increasing PVA to 10% (Experiment 13) showed a very low absorption in the UV region. The results suggested a UV protective effect of the films with glycerol applied as food packaging in foods with oxidative deterioration. The effect of glycerol decreasing the UV light transmission was also observed in hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, where treatment containing glycerol had lower transmission than the control film of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (Imran et al., 2012). In the NIR region, the absorptions at 1450 and 1950 nm were related to the first overtone of the OH stretch and the combined stretch and deformation of OH groups of glycerol. The absorption at 2260 nm is likely related to a combination of CH and OH stretch overtones, the latter from cellulose, and absorption at 2302 nm is primarily related to CH combination vibrations (CH3 and CH2) from carbohydrates and organic acids (Martelo-Vidal & Vázquez, 2014). The values of transparency obtained were 16.70, 36.25 and 13.67 to experiment 1, 2 and 13, respectively. Although the transmittance values for experiment 13 were greater than the other experiments, the transparency value obtained was low, because transparency are affected by film thickness (Elsabee & Abdou, 2013). Considering that the transparency values for low density polyethylene films were about 15–20 and 38.2 for polypropylene films (Lee, Son, & Hong, 2008), the films developed had optimal values of transparency, similar to the values of synthetic polymers."
18,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR),"3.7 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) FT-IR in absorbance mode is useful to characterize the presence of specific and important chemical groups in the films and confirm the presence of crosslinking in the optimized film. FT-IR spectra of cellulose films of experiment 1, 2 and 13 are shown in Fig. 10 . The FT-IR spectrum of the selected films showed similarities between them. The strong and broad band between 3700 and 3000 cm−1 are attributed to the stretching vibration regions of OH group (Fan, Dai, & Huang, 2012). The −OH band is sensitive to hydrogen bonding and can be compelled to a shifted wavenumber in FT-IR spectra. This is important, because the mechanical properties of the developed films can be affected by the intensity of the hydrogen bonding. Compared with the spectrum of experiment 2, the bands for films of experiment 1 and 13 at 3400 cm−1 became sharpened and displaced to a higher wavenumber, due to the glycerol and PVA content. Hydroxyl groups in C2, C3 and C6 contribute to the formation various kinds of inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonds. Therefore, the change observed at 3400 cm−1 suggested the existence of hydrogen bonding interactions between cellulose-glycerol-PVA molecules (Acharya, Hu, Moussa, & Abidi, 2017; Xiao et al., 2003; Zhang, Ruan, & Gao, 2002). Similar behaviour has been reported for PVA-glycerol films (Rouhi et al., 2017). There was no absorption band of free OH at 3600 cm−1, hence the hydroxyl groups are generally associated with the inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonding (Rouhi et al., 2017). The vibration bands at 2902 cm−1 and 2938 cm−1 are attributed to the aliphatic CH stretching from alkyl groups, being more intense with the presence of glycerol and PVA. The bands for experiment 2 at 2900 cm−1 shifted to high wavenumbers for experiment 1 and 13 as a result of the interaction between the glycerol and PVA with CH2 in the cellulose molecules (Xiao et al., 2003). The bands at 1375 cm−1 and 1365 cm−1 are associated to the CH bending (Fan et al., 2012). The absorbance peak observed at 1653 cm−1 and 1644 cm−1 was attributed to the HOH bending of the adsorbed water. The intensity of the stretching HOH band at 1644 cm−1 increased with the addition of glycerol (Fan et al., 2012; Rouhi et al., 2017). Around 1057 cm−1 it was observed the characteristic peak of cellulose, due to the COC pyranose ring stretching vibrations of aliphatic primary and secondary alcohols from the cellulose (Rouhi et al., 2017). The sharp peak at 895 cm−1 and 915 cm−1 corresponds to the glycosidic CH deformation with ring vibration contribution and OH bending, which is characteristic of β-glycosidic linkages cellulose (Liu et al., 2011). It was observed an increase of the absorbance at 895 cm−1 in films with glycerol. These interactions showed that the glycerol remained in the film during the regeneration process, demonstrating that it was not washed away by the wash water."
19,Thermal properties of films,"3.8 Thermal properties of films The DSC curves of the films developed (Fig. 11 ) could be divided into two main regions. The first region between 30 °C and 100 °C, corresponding to the volatilization of water from the films samples, and the second region, between 180 °C and 390 °C, corresponding to the depolymerization of the components of the films (Morán, Alvarez, Cyras, & Vázquez, 2008; Phinichka & Kaenthong, 2016). The temperature corresponding to the peak height in the DSC curve is taken as Tmax (Liu et al., 2011). It was observed an endotherm peak (Tmax) at 221 °C, corresponding to the fusion endotherm of the PVA (Nishio & Manley, 1989). This peak was larger and sharper for DSC curve of sample of experiment 13, due to the higher PVA content (10%). Films with glycerol were more difficult to clearly detect the melting endotherm in the DSC curves. The presence of glycerol softened the endothermic peaks (Maria, de Carvalho, Sobral, Habitante, & Solorza-Feria, 2008), probably because of the interactions between cellulose-glycerol-PVA that thermally stabilize the samples. Films showed peaks between 225 and 325 °C, corresponding to the onset temperature of thermal degradation of cellulose (Liu et al., 2011), which are attributed to the decomposition processes involving the main chains of the polymers. As shown in Fig. 11, the increase in PVA in cellulose films, increased thermal stability of the films, which is attributable to the increased interaction between the plasticizers and cellulose films (Morgado, Frollini, Castellan, Rosa, & Coma, 2011b). This effect was also observed in regenerated cellulose films immersed in different α-monoglycerides (Xiao et al., 2003)."
20,Conclusions,"It was possible to develop biodegradable composite films based on cellulose and polyvinyl alcohol with improved mechanical properties and high capacity to adsorb water. These properties could be useful in some applications in the food industry and as an alternative to synthetic films. Polyvinyl alcohol enhanced the toughness of composite films based in cellulose and glycerol acting as a plasticizer. However, toughness decreased when increasing glycerol concentration. Glycerol showed an anti-plasticizing behavior when added directly to the cellulose solution. Soaking the final regenerated cellulose film, instead of adding the plasticizer to the initial solution is an alternative to avoid the anti-plasticizing effect. The plasticizing effect of PVA was also observed in the values of burst strength and distance to burst. Furthermore, PVA caused an increase in the thickness of the films affecting burst strength and distance to burst. It is important to notice the high values obtained for burst strength in comparison with values obtained for other types of biodegradable films. The adsorbed water increased up to 222% when 10% of PVA was used. SEM analysed showed PVA softens the surface of the film, obtaining a dense structure. Glycerol content produced a UV protective effect on the films, an important application in food packaging to prevent oxidative deterioration of food. Furthermore, cellulose-glycerol-PVA films had optimal values of transparency, like the values of synthetic polymers. FTIR and DSC analyses showed an interaction between the components of the films. The mathematical models obtained allow predicting the measured properties for any formulation in the range of study."
