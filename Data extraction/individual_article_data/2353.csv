0,Introduction,"Biohydrogen production from biomass substrates is attracting more and more attention nowadays, since it can remove organic biomass wastes while simultaneously supplying clean hydrogen energy [1–4]. However, low yield and rate, and high cost are main obstacles in the development and application of biohydrogen technology. Cassava, which is grown extensively all over the world, is a kind of low-cost biomass and can grow well in barren and droughty areas. It mainly contains moisture (60–70%), starch (15–20%) and free sugars (4–6%). Because of no competition for lands with food crops and high productivity, cassava is considered as the ideal energy crop. According to Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the global and China’s cassava production reached 228 and 4.4 million tons in 2007. At present, most cassava is used in chemical and textile industry, and few are used to produce fuel ethanol [5]. If cassava is used to produce hydrogen in biological fermentation, it will make great contribution to biomass energy. Hydrogen production from starch was conducted in some researches, but hydrogen yields were only 100–200 ml H2/g starch [3,4,6–12]. Conventional dark fermentation only can produce 2–4 mol hydrogen from 1 mol hexose with the production of acetate and butyrate [13], which can lead to environmental pollution. To solve this problem, many efforts were devoted to the utilization of organic acids solution produced from dark fermentation for further methane and hydrogen production in another process [14–16]. Our recent work showed that the combination of dark and photo fermentation could greatly improve hydrogen yield from 240 to 402 ml H2/g starch [17]. Cassava starch was first hydrolyzed into reducing sugar by gelatinization or enzymatic hydrolysis, which was utilized by anaerobic bacteria in dark fermentation to produce hydrogen, carbon dioxide and volatile fatty acids (VFAs). Then the VFAs from dark fermentation were further fermented by pure photosynthetic bacteria Rhodopseudomonas palustris to produce hydrogen. However, the amylase and glucoamylase used for enzymatic hydrolysis may be too expensive for biohydrogen production. Condition optimization and bacterial strain improvement are required to obtain higher hydrogen yield at lower cost. Recently we successfully isolated mixed photosynthetic bacteria from activated sludge, which has higher hydrogen productivity and adaptability to environment. There are few reports about hydrogen production by mixed photosynthetic bacteria in the literatures [18]. In this study, response surface methodology (RSM) was conducted to explore the effects of substrate concentration, fermentation temperature and pH on hydrogen yield from gelatinized cassava starch in dark fermentation. Mixed photosynthetic bacteria and cell immobilization were used to improve hydrogen yield in the following photo fermentation."

2,Bacterial strains and culture medium,"2.1 Bacterial strains and culture medium The anaerobic activated sludge, which was collected in a methane plant, was boiled for 30 min to inactivate methanogens and acclimated for three times (each time for 72 h) to harvest mixed spore-forming hydrogen-producing bacteria. The mixed hydrogen-producing bacteria, primary bacterial strain of which was identified as Clostridium species (mainly Clostridium butyricum) after analysis of biochemical characteristics and 16S r DNA sequence (data not reported), were used as the inoculum in dark fermentation. The basal medium for hydrogen production contained (g/l): peptone, 4.0; l-cysteine, 0.5; NaCl, 3.0; MgCl2, 0.1; FeCl2, 0.1; K2HPO4, 2.5; vitamin liquid, 10 ml; trace element liquid, 10 ml.

Mixed photosynthetic bacteria (PSB) isolated from active sludge, the primary bacterial strain of which was identified as R. palustris species after analysis of biochemical characteristics and 16S r DNA sequence in our previous study [19], were used as the inoculum in photo fermentation. The isolation method was as follows: 5 g active sludge was put in a conical flask mixed with 50 ml deionized water and then oscillated for 20 min at 120 r/min. 5 ml bacteria suspension stated above was added in a 100-ml bottle mixed with basal medium with acetate as carbon resource. The bottle was sealed with rubber stopper and placed in an illuminated incubator equipped with a microcomputer (Shanghai Boxun SPX-300I-G, China) at 30 ± 0.5 °C under a light intensity of 2000 lux. 7 days later, small quantities of red mixed bacteria were discovered on the bottle wall. The red bacteria were cultured again for 3 days in the same medium. The same procedure was operated for 3 times to enrich the mixed photosynthetic bacteria. The basal medium for photo fermentation contained (g/l): KH2PO4, 0.5; K2HPO4, 0.6; NaCl, 0.2; MgSO4, 0.2; CaCl2·2H2O, 0.05; NaHCO3, 2.0; sodium glutamate, 1.87; vitamin liquid, 1.0 ml; trace element liquid, 1.0 ml.

3,Experimental operation,"2.2 Experimental operation Cassava starch (10–20 μm of particles), which mainly contained starch (85.3%), moisture (14.3%), protein (0.2%), lipid (0.1%) and ash (0.1%), was used as substrate in dark fermentation. Cassava starch was gelatinized for 15 min at 112 °C and then used for hydrogen production. Batch tests were performed in 300-ml transfusion bottles. 25 ml pre-cultured activated sludge was added into each bottle mixed with 225 ml autoclaved medium. Substrate concentration, temperature and pH were adjusted according to the experimental design in Table 1 . The fermentation reactors were fitted with rubber stoppers and purged with N2 gas for 20 min to ensure an anaerobic environment. The initial pH for hydrogen production was adjusted with 6 M NaOH and 6 M HCl solution. The fermentation temperature was controlled by a constant temperature water bath. Biogas rich in hydrogen was discharged from the fermentor headspace and collected with a 1-L graduated container. The residual liquid of dark fermentation, which mostly contained acetate and butyrate, was collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 4800 rpm. The residual was diluted according to an optimal concentration of 20 mM acetate [13] and then added into the autoclaved medium for photosynthetic bacteria. The initial pH for hydrogen production in photo fermentation was adjusted to 7.0 ± 0.02 with 6 M NaOH and 6 M HCl solution. The fermentor with a rubber stopper was purged with N2 gas for 20 min to ensure an anaerobic environment. The fermentor inoculated with immobilized mixed photosynthetic bacteria was placed in an illuminated incubator equipped with a microcomputer (Shanghai Boxun SPX-300I-G, China) at 30 ± 0.5 °C under a light intensity of 200 W/m2 (about 6000 lux). Incandescent lamps (100 W) were used as input light resources and a light meter (TES-1334A, Taiwan) was used to measure illumination intensity. VFAs amounts were measured after the photo fermentation."
4,Cell immobilization,2.3 Cell immobilization Mixed photosynthetic bacteria (PSB) were acclimated and enriched for 72 h in growth medium. 0.75 g sodium alginate was dissolved in 24.25 ml sterile water at 3% (w/v) and heated for 15 min at 112 °C. This solution was cooled to 30–40 °C and mixed with 25 ml enriched PSB suspension. The mixed solution was then drawn into a 100-ml graduated syringe and developed into gel. The cells immobilized in the sodium alginate were injected into 1.5% CaCl2 solution gradually through the syringe. The diameter of immobilized gel granules was 3–4 mm.
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The produced biogas rich in H2 and CO2 was measured with a graduated glass syringe and analyzed every 12 h on a gas chromatograph (GC, Beijing Beifen-Ruili SP-3400, China) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 5 A column (φ3 mm × 3 m). The operating temperatures of the injection port, the oven and the detector were 50, 50 and 100 °C, respectively. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 30 ml/min. The VFAs in the liquids were analyzed on another gas chromatograph (GC, Thermo Finigan TRACE 2000, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a DB-Waxtre column (φ5 mm × 2 m). The operating temperatures for the injection port, the oven and the FID were 200, 240 and 280 °C, respectively."
6,Experimental design and kinetics analysis,"2.5 Experimental design and kinetics analysis To investigate the effects of substrate concentration, fermentation temperature and pH on hydrogen yield, a central composite design (CCD) was used to optimize the experimental factors. 20 batch experiments were conducted as designed in Table 1. The ranges of cassava starch, fermentation temperature and pH were 5–15 g/l (central value = 10 g/l), 25–45 °C (central value = 35 °C) and 5.5–7.5 (central value = 6.5) respectively. The levels of initial substrate concentration, fermentation temperature and pH were determined by the following equation: (1) X i = A i − A 0 Δ A where Xi denotes the code value of the ith test variable, Ai is a real value of the ith test variable, A0 is the value of Ai at the center point, and ΔA is the step change value of variable. The experimental design for X1 (cassava starch), X2 (temperature) and X3 (pH) was described in Table 1. The response was hydrogen yield (mol H2/mol hexose). In this study, the experimental design contained 20 trials and all the experimental data were the averages (±standard deviation) of values obtained in independent experiments conducted in triplicate. The regression analysis was carried out by generating a second-order regression equation using Design Expert 7.1.3: (2) Y = α 0 + α 1 X 1 + α 2 X 2 + α 3 X 3 + α 12 X 1 X 2 + α 13 X 1 X 3 + α 23 X 2 X 3 + α 11 X 1 2 + α 22 X 2 2 + α 33 X 3 2 where Y is the response value obtained from RSM, αi, αj and αij are the parameters estimated from the regression equation. The volume of hydrogen produced in batch experiments was produced from 250 ml medium and modified to standard temperature and air pressure. The hydrogen yield (mol/mol or ml/g) was defined as the ratio of hydrogen produced (mol or ml) to the initial starch (mol or g). All the experimental data were the average (±standard deviation) of values obtained in independent experiments conducted in triplicate."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Optimizing culture conditions for hydrogen production in dark fermentation,"3.1 Optimizing culture conditions for hydrogen production in dark fermentation The response surface analysis was conducted based on hydrogen yield. The effects of starch concentration, fermentation temperature and pH on hydrogen yield were studied. By implying the experimental data (Table 1) in regression analysis, the following equation was obtained to describe the response surface of hydrogen yield: (3) Y = 2.07 − 0.35 X 1 − 0.044 X 2 + 0.014 X 3 + 0.018 X 1 X 2 − 0.036 X 1 X 3 + 0.017 X 2 X 3 − 0.44 X 1 2 − 0.10 X 2 2 − 0.15 X 3 2 where Y is the predicted hydrogen yield, X1, X2 and X3 are the coded values of starch concentration, temperature and pH respectively. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine the significance of the fit of the polynomial equation for the experimental data. In Table 2 , the model F-value 18.07 indicated the model is significant. There is only a 0.01% chance that a “Model F-Value” could occur due to noise. The p-value is used to check the significance of each independent variable. The smaller the p-value, the bigger the significance of corresponding variable [20]. In this study, p-value less than 0.05 indicate model terms are significant. In this case X2, X 1 2 , X 2 2 and X 3 2 are significant model terms. Here, the R 2 value of 0.942, which could explain 94.2% variability of the response, indicates the regression model (Eq. (3)) fit the experimental data quite well in this study. The response surfaces are illustrated in Fig. 1 , which depicts the interactions between two variables when keeping another one at zero level. The highest points in Fig. 1 indicate the optimal culture conditions for maximum hydrogen yield. According to Fig. 1a and b, hydrogen yield increased remarkably when cassava starch increased from 0 to 10.4 g/l. However, hydrogen yield started to decrease when cassava starch was higher than 10.4 g/l. This can be attributed to excessive substrate and large quantities of byproducts in hydrogen production process, which will cause substrate and byproduct inhibition [13]. Fig. 1a and c shows that temperature had a great influence on hydrogen yield. When temperature increased from 25 to 31 °C, hydrogen yield increased with the temperature. This indicates low temperature can decrease the bacteria’s metabolism and hydrogen productivity. However, higher temperature than 31 °C leaded to a downtrend in hydrogen yield. This may be because high temperature can cause the denaturation of active substance in bacteira, which will decrease the hydrogen productivity of bacteria [21,22]. In Fig. 1b and c, when pH was lower than 6.3, hydrogen yield increased with the pH. However, when pH increased further to 8.2, hydrogen yield slightly decreased. This may be caused by pH variance, which can cause the charge variation of cell membrane and the decrease of hydrogenase activity [22]. Based on the response surface analysis from Eq. (3), the optimal conditions for hydrogen production were 10.4 g/l starch, 31 °C and pH 6.3. To validate the optimization effect by response surface method in this study, the optimized condition (10.4 g/l starch, 31 °C and pH 6.3) was designed for hydrogen production to compare with the culture condition of zero level in the experiments (10 g/l starch, 35 °C and pH 6.5), which was marked as original condition. The results were shown in Fig. 2 and Table 3 . Under optimized condition, the hydrogen yield and maximum HPR were 351 ml H2/g starch (2.53 mol H2/mol hexose) and 334.8 and ml/l/h respectively, which were much higher than 277 ml H2/g starch (2.00 mol H2/mol hexose) and 248.4 ml/l/h under original condition. As shown in Table 3, soluble metabolite products from dark fermentation were mainly acetate and butyrate, which accounted for 53.5–58.0% and 29.5–35.2% respectively. The formation of acetate and butyrate is companied by the hydrogen production, and they could be used as substrate for hydrogen production in photo fermentation. Therefore, they are important indicators for hydrogen yield [7]. Produced acetate, butyrate and SMP under original condition were 5.2, 2.7 and 9.0 g/l respectively. In comparison, the optimized condition could produce more acetate, butyrate and SMP, which were 5.9, 3.9 and 11.0 g/l respectively. In following experiments, they would be further used for hydrogen production in photo fermentation."
9,Hydrogen production by mixed photosynthetic bacteria in photo fermentation,"3.2 Hydrogen production by mixed photosynthetic bacteria in photo fermentation In our previous study, the primary bacterial strain of mixed photosynthetic bacteria (PSB) was identified as R. palustris species after analysis of biochemical characteristics and 16S r DNA sequence [19]. To compare the hydrogen productivity, the same amount (25 ml) of immobilized PSB, free PSB, immobilized R. palustris and free R. palustris were used to produce hydrogen from 20 mM acetate by photo fermentation in 250-ml transfusion bottles, which were shown in Fig. 3 . The pure R. palustris produced more hydrogen during the first 48 h compared to the mixed PSB. This suggested that some acetate was rapidly metabolized by R. palustris and the remaining acetate was metabolized at a higher rate by some other bacteria in the population compared to R. palustris. Hydrogen yields of immobilized and free PSB were 2.23 and 1.83 mol H2/mol acetate respectively. Hydrogen yields of immobilized and free R. palustris were 2.14 and 1.80 mol H2/mol acetate respectively. Hydrogen yield of immobilized PSB (2.23 mol/mol) was 24% higher than that of free R. palustris. This may be due to two reasons: (1) the synergism of mixed photosynthetic bacteria can enhance the activity of hydrogenase and improve the hydrogen productivity of mixed photosynthetic bacteria. (2) Cell immobilization can increase the bacteria concentration, which is favorable for hydrogen production [23]. Immobilized PSB were used to produce hydrogen from residual solution of dark fermentation in the following photo fermentation. Residual solution from dark fermentation mainly contained acetate (53.5–58.0 wt%) and butyrate (29.5–35.2 wt%). In photo fermentation, immobilized mixed photosynthetic bacteria were used as the inoculums. Our study found that the optimal concentrations of acetate and butyrate for hydrogen production were 20 mM and 15 mM respectively, and excessive substrate would inhibit the hydrogen production [13]. In this study, residual solution from dark fermentation was diluted according to 20 mM acetate before photo fermentation. Hydrogen yield and hydrogen production rate were shown in Table 4 . Hydrogen yields under optimized and original conditions were 489 ml H2/g starch (3.54 mol/mol hexose) and 409 ml H2/g starch (2.95 mol/mol hexose) respectively. The SMP data in Tables 3 and 4 showed that most SMP was utilized in photo fermentation. Removal ratios of acetate, butyrate and SMP reached 94.8–95.2%, 97.5–98.1% and 96.5% respectively. By combination of dark and photo fermentation, the hydrogen yield of 351 ml H2/g starch (2.53 mol H2/mol hexose) and 277 ml H2/g starch (2.00 mol H2/mol hexose) under optimized and original conditions in dark fermentation were significantly increased to 840 ml H2/g starch (6.07 mol H2/mol hexose) and 686 ml H2/g starch (4.95 mol H2/mol hexose) respectively."
10,Comparison with relevant studies,"3.3 Comparison with relevant studies The hydrogen production performance of this study is compared with previous relevant studies reported in the literature. As indicated in Table 5 , the hydrogen yield in dark fermentation of this study (351 ml/g) is higher than those of other studies in single-step anaerobic fermentation (133–298.7 ml/g). The optimal substrate concentration 10.4 g/l optimized by RSM in this study is lower than most substrate in other studies. This can relieve the effects of substrate inhibition and enhance the hydrogen yield [13]. The optimal temperature and pH for hydrogen fermentation varied from culture to culture according to the inoculums, but mostly fell in the range of 30–40 °C and 5.0–7.0. The optimal fermentation temperature and pH in this study were 31 °C and 6.3 respectively. Combination of dark and photo fermentation can increase the theoretical hydrogen yield from 4 to 12 mol/mol hexose significantly [13]. In Table 5, hydrogen yields from cassava starch on combining dark and photo fermentation are shown. Hydrogen yield of 840 ml/g starch in this study is higher than most reported values. Yokoi et al. obtained a hydrogen yield of 870 ml/g starch from sweet potato remainder (contained 49% starch) by a mixed culture of C. butyricum and E. aerogenes, and then combining the photo fermentation of Rhodobacter sp. M-19 in two-step repeated batch cultures [24]. However, the sweet potato remainder used in Yokoi’s study contained cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin, which may contribute to hydrogen production. Yokoi attributed all the hydrogen yields to starch with no consideration of these compositions. Although this study obtained a little lower hydrogen yield than Yokoi’s research, mixed bacteria used in the dark and photo fermentation of this study were more adaptable to various feedstock, fermentation environments and industrial application."
11,Conclusions,"Mixed bacteria, response surface methodology (RSM) and cell immobilization used in this study can effectively enhance the hydrogen yields in dark and photo fermentation. In dark fermentation, the maximum hydrogen yield of 351 ml H2/g starch and production rate of 334.8 ml H2/l/h were obtained based on RSM analysis. In photo fermentation, immobilized PSB could give a hydrogen yield of 489 ml H2/g starch. In our previous study, the maximum hydrogen yield from hydrolyzed starch by combination of dark and photo fermentation was 402 ml H2/g starch [17]. In this study, the hydrogen yield was enhanced to 840 ml H2/g starch by the application of mixed bacteria, RSM and cell immobilization. Besides, this study avoids the use of enzyme, thus greatly reduces the production cost and promotes the application of biological hydrogen. However, the experimental hydrogen yield is only 50.6% of the theoretical value and needs further improvement."
