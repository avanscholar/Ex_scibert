0,Introduction,"The development of technologies for the production of clean energy from renewable sources is increasingly attracting the attention of the society nowadays. Biotransformation of organic waste into biogas can be considered an interesting alternative among the several approaches to accomplish that. In fact, many benefits can be gained from this method. From an environmental point of view, biodegradation reduces both the volume and the organic content of the waste, minimizing their impact on the ecosystem in the case of inadequate disposal. As regards to economic advantages, a high-energy renewable fuel is produced in the form of biogas while waste handling and disposal costs are reduced (Alibardi and Cossu, 2015; Han et al., 2005; Wong et al., 2014). Improvements in the management of the waste associated with the compliance with the local regulations also imply political benefits from the organic waste biodegradation. Hydrogen (H2) has been widely recognized as a clean energy source with zero pollutant emissions and high specific energy content (142 kJ/g). Such characteristics make it an ideal alternative to fossil fuels (Levin et al., 2004). Among the biological methods to produce this gas, dark fermentation stands out because it is a simple technology and, at the same time, it allows to obtain H2 from a great variety of substrates, enhancing the sustainability and viability of the production system (Das, 2009). Municipal and industrial wastes are among the most commonly used wastes in anaerobic fermentation processes due to their physical and chemical characteristics, low cost and great availability (Nathao et al., 2013). The attractiveness of municipal waste (e.g., food waste (FW), kitchen waste and paper waste) is justified by the fact that they consist essentially of organic matter. Therefore, anaerobic digestion is considered to be a feasible alternative method to both decrease the costs associated with treatment of such wastes and recover renewable energy in the form of biogas (Izumi et al., 2010). Anaerobic digestion is a natural process that occurs in four consecutive biochemical stages in which distinct groups of microorganisms (bacteria and archaea) degrade complex organic compounds into simpler products in the absence of oxygen. In a simplified way, the anaerobic digestion process can be divided into two stages: fermentation and methanogenesis. The fermentation stage can be subdivided into three phases: hydrolysis, acidogenesis and acetogenesis (Palmisano and Barlaz, 1996). Hydrogen is an important intermediate in the anaerobic degradation of organic matter (Liu et al., 2006). Therefore, to enable obtaining a high hydrogen yield and consequently a gas rich in H2, it is necessary to interrupt the anaerobic digestion process in the acidogenic phase. To achieve this, favorable operating conditions for acidogenic bacteria should be established while the activity of H2-consuming microorganisms (both methanogenic archaea and homoacetogenic bacteria) should be prevented (Ntaikou et al., 2010). However, during the dark fermentation of organic wastes, typically only 10–20% of the energy contained in the substrate is converted into gaseous products as hydrogen and carbon dioxide, while 80–90% of the initial chemical oxygen demand (COD) such as soluble metabolic products, including volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and ethanol, remains in the liquid phase (Cooney et al., 2007; Schievano et al., 2012). Therefore, a second stage of treatment (i.e., anaerobic digestion for methane production) can be combined with the fermentative hydrogen production stage to optimize the use of the remaining organic matter and therefore increase energy recovery (Kyazze et al., 2007). In this context, two-stage anaerobic digestion has been identified as a promising method because it allows the reduction of organic load and increases the overall energy conversion efficiency by generating two gases with high combustion power (Liu et al., 2013). The separation of hydrolysis/acidogenesis and methanogenesis phases could increase the stability of the whole process by controlling the acidification phase in the hydrogen production phase (first stage) and hence preventing the inhibition of the methanogenic population during methane generation phase (second stage) (Fu et al., 2017). Recently, it has been shown that co-digestion of two or more substrates with complementary characteristics can result in synergistic effects, which may lead to improvements in biogas yield, process stability and costs reduction through the processing of different wastes in a single installation over traditional mono-digestion (Wu et al., 2016). Besides the optimization of anaerobic digestion reaction stoichiometry, co-digestion of different wastes can positively influence digestion performance with respect to sludge degradation. Xie et al. (2017) reported that synergistic effects can be reflected in increased biogas yields, accelerated biodegradation processes or a combination of both. Crude glycerol is an industrial waste that has been attracting much attention worldwide due to the expansion of the biodiesel production. Consisting of a by-product of the production chain of this biofuel, the growing market for biodiesel leads to a higher amount of glycerol available in the market. Due to its high biodegradability (≈100%) and for being a carbon source easily assimilated by bacteria and yeasts under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Mata-Alvarez et al., 2014; Thompson and He, 2006), glycerol is considered as an ideal substrate to be co-digested with other residues. Furthermore, the biological conversion of glycerol represents a promising path towards an economic viability in the biofuel sector (Fountoulakis and Manios, 2009). Studies reported in the literature mainly focused on the sequential production of H2 and CH4 employing food waste as substrate (Chu et al., 2008; Han et al., 2005; Lee and Chung, 2010; Pisutpaisal et al., 2014; Wang and Zhao, 2009). Some have demonstrated the increase of H2 yield from the co-digestion of organic waste with sewage sludge (Kim et al., 2013a,b; Kim et al., 2004; Sreela-or et al., 2011; Tyagi et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2008a). One-stage H2 production from the digestion of organic waste or sewage sludge with crude glycerol as co-substrate were also evaluated (Fountoulakis and Manios, 2009; Rivero et al., 2014; Sittijunda and Reungsang, 2012; Zahedi et al., 2016). Nevertheless, information on two-stage anaerobic systems for H2 and CH4 production using mixtures of more than two wastes is still scarce. The aim of this study was to perform a technical and energetic evaluation of a two-stage anaerobic co-digestion process for hydrogen and methane production employing a ternary mixture of food waste, sewage sludge and glycerol as substrate. Different glycerol concentrations (namely 1% and 3% v/v) were tested and their effect on biogas generation was assessed. Besides that, the overall energy recovery resulting from the anaerobic co-digestion process was also assessed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Feedstock samples,"2.1 Feedstock samples Three different wastes, namely food waste (FW), sewage sludge (SS) and raw glycerol (GL), were used as substrates in this study. Samples of FW were collected during an entire week at the university restaurant of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Brazil. The composition of FW was as follows: Fruits and vegetables (57.4%); Grains (13.5%); Meat (bovine, poultry, fish) (26.3%) and rejected materials (bones and wastes not visually identified) (2.8%). The percentages are based on wet weight. FW samples were shredded in a kitchen mill (Philips Walita – Rl7630) and subsequently diluted with water to make a stock solution, which was then stored in a freezer at −20 °C to avoid degradation that would possibly occur at room temperature. Such procedure was important to ensure that the substrate composition was maintained invariant during the experiments. After this preparation, the FW was characterized in order to have more detailed information about this substrate (Table 1 ).The sewage sludge (SS) used in this work was collected from the primary settler of a municipal sewage treatment plant located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The sludge sample was stored in plastic containers and kept under refrigeration at 4 °C. Before each test, the sludge was removed from the refrigerator and maintained at room temperature. Crude glycerol (GL) originated from the transesterification of soybean oil (60%) and animal fat (40%) was supplied by a research center (CENPES/PETROBRAS), located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. To prevent possible disturbances in the experiments related to overloading and microorganisms inhibition, the glycerol was diluted with water to make a stock solution of 10 g VS/L, which was then stored at room temperature. The characterization of the three substrates (FW, SS and GL) used in the several assays is shown in Table 1."
3,Inoculum,"2.2 Inoculum The inoculum used in this study consisted of anaerobic digester sludge obtained from a municipal sewage treatment plant, located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The pH and volatile solids (VS) concentration of the inoculum were approximately 7 and 28.3 g/L, respectively. The anaerobic digester sludge sample was preserved at 4 °C until the experiments were carried out."
4,Batch experiments,"2.3 Batch experiments 2.3.1 Biochemical hydrogen potential (BHP) Laboratory scale co-digestion experiments were performed to evaluate the Biochemical Hydrogen Potential (BHP) of the substrates. Batch tests were carried at in glass bottles of 250 mL hermetically closed with nylon caps, coupled with manometers of 1 kgf/cm2 and valves which allowed N2 injection (for oxygen depletion) and sampling of the gas produced over time (Fig. 1 ) (Alves, 2008). The working volume of each bottle was 120 mL and the remaining (130 mL) consisted of the headspace volume. The bottles were filled with substrate (60 mL) and inoculum (60 mL) in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio (Tyagi et al., 2014). The substrate concentration in all experiments was 10 gVS/L, regardless of the waste combinations used (Alibardi and Cossu, 2015). The ratio between substrate volatile solids and inoculum volatile biomass (Food/Microorganisms ratio)) was 0.5 gVS/gVS. The inoculum used in BHP tests underwent a heat-shock pre-treatment method (100 °C for 30 min) to inactive H2 consuming bacteria and avoid methane generation (Dong et al., 2010). The pH of the mixture of substrate and inoculum was adjusted to 5.5 using a 1 M HCl solution. Before the batch tests with ternary mixture (i.e., FW, SS and GL), the proportion of food waste and primary sewage sludge (FW + SS) enabling higher H2 production to be achieved was determined in a preliminary experiment. The proportions of 1:1 and 2:1 (v/v) were evaluated. The primary sludge has undergone heat pre-treatment at a temperature of 100 °C for 30 min in order to inhibit the activity of methanogenic archaea and favor the predominance of H2 producing bacteria (Massanet-Nicolau et al., 2008). Subsequently, the addition of glycerol in the mixture comprising FW and SS was evaluated. The ternary mixtures were supplemented with 1% and 3% GL (v/v) relative to the volume of the substrate pre-established in each experiment. Samples containing a mixture of food waste and primary sludge, without addition of glycerol, were used as control in the tests with ternary mixtures. Blank tests using only the pre-treated inoculum (no substrate addition) were also conducted to assess the hydrogen production attributed only to the seed biomass. After these preparations, the bottles were flushed with N2 gas for 3 min to ensure anaerobic conditions and incubated in an orbital shaker under mesophilic conditions (35 ± 1 °C) at 150 rpm for 36 h. All tests were carried out in triplicate. The pressures in each bottle were frequently monitored, while gas samples were regularly collected over time every 4 h to determine the content of H2 in the biogas. 2.3.2 Biochemical methane potential The acidified effluents resulting from the H2 production phase (acidogenesis stage) were used as substrate for CH4 production (methanogenesis stage). There was no separation of the solid and liquid fractions from the acidified effluents. BMP tests were carried out in the same experimental apparatus used for the BHP tests (Fig. 1). In this stage, however, the pH was set at 7 using a 1 M NaOH solution and the Food/Microorganisms ratio was 0.33 gVS/gVS. Moreover, the anaerobic sludge used as inoculum in the BMP tests was not subjected to heat-shock pretreatment, but only acclimated to the operating conditions (temperature of 35 °C and rotation at 150 rpm) for 5 days for establishment of the methanogenic biomass (Angelidaki et al., 2009) The bottles were flushed with N2 gas and incubated for 40 days. The pressure of each bottle was monitored on daily basis, while gas samples were collected to determine the content of CH4 in the biogas. As carried out in the BHP experiments, blank tests using just the inoculum as substrate were also prepared to measure the amount of methane produced by the seed biomass only. All tests were carried out in triplicate. Effluent samples from the acidogenic experiments with the mixture of food waste and primary sludge, without addition of glycerol, were used as control. Fig. 2 shows a simplified flowchart representing the two-stage lab-scale anaerobic digestion system with the main operating settings."
5,Analytical methods and data analysis,"2.4 Analytical methods and data analysis Chemical oxygen demand (COD), pH and volatile solids (VS) were analysed in triplicate according to standard methods (APHA - American Public Health Association, 2005). Total carbohydrate content was determined by the colorimetric method developed by Dubois et al. using glucose as the standard (Dubois et al., 1956). The concentration of proteins was determined using the Bradford method (Bradford, 1976), with bovine serum albumin as a standard reference. The H2 content in the biogas was determined by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC2010) using Carboxen 1010 PLOT column and a thermal conductivity detector (DCT). The injector, detector and oven temperatures were 220 °C, 230 °C and 130–135 °C (6 min), respectively. Argon was used as the carrier gas (Adorno and Tomita, 2014). The CH4 content in the biogas was determined using a Micro CG (Varian CP 4900) coupled to a PPQ (10 mesh) column. The temperature of the column and the thermal conductivity detector (DCT) were 50 °C and 250 °C, respectively, while the injection temperature was 80 °C. Helium was used as the carrier gas (Santos et al., 2014). The biogas samples were collected and stored in gas ampoules. The volumetric biogas production was estimated by means of the manometric method, whereby the measured pressure is converted to biogas volume under the testing conditions, using the ideal gas law. The volumetric biogas production under the Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) conditions (i.e., 273 K and 1 atm) can then be assessed. The calculation of the biogas generation potential was carried out using Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2) (Harries et al., 2001). The volumetric hydrogen and methane production was calculated, respectively, by multiplying the volumetric biogas production by the H2 and CH4 content in the biogas (%), as assessed by gas chromatography analysis. The pressures in each test bottle and the atmospheric pressures obtained from the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) (www.inmet.com.br) were used for data analysis. (2.1) V t,t + 1 = P F × V UF × C R × T F × 1000 (2.2) Accumulated biogas ( mL ) = V t,t + 1 + V AG where V t,t + 1 is the volume of biogas produced in the time interval between t and t + 1; P F is the internal pressure of the biogas inside the bottle (mbar); V UF is the useful volume of the bottle (L); C is the molar volume (22.41 L/mol); R is the Universal gas constant (83.14 L mbar/(mol k)); T F is the temperature (K) and V AG is the accumulated biogas volume measured in the previous time period (mL). Biogas yield was calculated by dividing the biogas production potential by the amount of VS removed. A modified Gompertz model (Eq. (2.3)) was employed to fit the experimental data from the Biochemical Hydrogen Potential (BHP) and Biochemical Methane Potential (BMP) tests. Based on the cumulative hydrogen and methane production obtained in the batch experiments, the following parameters of the Gompertz equation were determined: hydrogen/methane production potential (P), maximum hydrogen/methane production rate (Rm) and the lag phase time (λ). (2.3) H or M = P exp - exp R m e P ( λ - t ) + 1 where H and M represents, respectively, the cumulative hydrogen and methane volume (mL), P is the hydrogen/methane production potential (mL), Rm is the maximum hydrogen/methane production rate (mL/h), λ is the lag phase time (h), e is equal to 2.718 and t represents the incubation time (hour or day). The values of P, Rm and λ were determined by fitting the cumulative H2/CH4 volume over time with the modified Gompertz equation using the Solver function in Microsoft Excel 2013. The residual sum of squares between the experimental and estimated data was minimized to improve model fit. The energy conversion efficiency was calculated based on the density and calorific value of the H2 and CH4 gases, i.e., 0.09 kg/m3 and 0.72 kg/m3 and 142 kJ/g and 55.6 kJ/g, respectively (Peixoto et al., 2012)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,First phase of the two-stage anaerobic digestion process: Hydrogen production,"3.1 First phase of the two-stage anaerobic digestion process: Hydrogen production The first set of experiments was carried out with binary mixture consisting of FW and SS. Two FW:SS ratios (namely 1:1 and 2:1 (v/v)) were tested in order to determine the proportion of such substrates to be used as the control for the co-digestion assays with glycerol as co-substrate (i.e., ternary mixture experiments). The cumulative H2 volume data was fitted to the modified Gompertz Equation (Table 2 ). Lag phase time is an important parameter to be assessed during anaerobic digestion, as it expresses the start-up performance in terms of biogas production (Fu et al., 2017). As the H2 production was only monitored every 4 h within 36 h of acidogenic test, the duration of the lag phase of the microbiota was estimated by the modified Gompertz model. The estimated lag phase in the control experiment (FW) was 7.9 h, while in the tests co-digesting SS and FW, the adaptation time lasted was 8.7 and 8.4 h for the tests using FW:SS ratios of 1:1 and 2:1, respectively. All tests with the binary mixture of FW and SS yielded higher H2 production as compared to the experiments carried out with only one of these substrates (control samples) (Fig. 3 A). The FW:SS ratio of 2:1 led to higher maximum accumulated H2 volume (12 mL H2) as compared to the 1:1 ratio (8.2 mL H2). On the other hand, in the control test with only FW, the accumulated H2 volume reached 7.1 mL H2, while in the tests employing SS as single substrate, no H2 generation was observed. Similar findings were reported by Kim et al. (2011), who attributed the insignificant H2 production to the intrinsic characteristics of the sludge used, such as low carbohydrate content and low biodegradability. However, these authors observed opposite results when the sewage sludge was co-digested with other types of organic wastes. It is interesting to note that the accumulated H2 production achieved in the co-digestion of FW and SS was greater than the sum of the accumulated H2 volume attained in both control experiments (with either FW or SS as single substrate). Taking into account these findings, a synergistic effect may be envisaged between these two substrates, which may have contributed to correct the imbalance of nutrients and improve biodegradation (Zhou et al., 2013). The maximum H2 content in the biogas corresponded to 35.9%, value obtained in the experiments with the FW:SS ratio of 2:1. In terms of H2 yield, the highest value was also achieved at the same FW:SS ratio (92.5 mL H2/g VS), corresponding to an increase of 90% in relation to that obtained in the control sample (48.7 mL H2/g VS) (Fig. 3B). Kim et al. (2013b) also reported an increase in H2 production when the FW:SS ratio increased from 1:1 to 2:1. These findings can be justified by the higher availability of organic matter in the organic food residues, mainly in the form of soluble carbohydrates. Zhou et al. (2013) reported that the addition of SS to FW had a positive effect only when the percentage of the former was less than 50% of the total mixture. Therefore, the use of FW and SS as main and secondary substrates, respectively, seems to be promising to maximize H2 production (Shin et al., 2003). In view of the results obtained, the FW:SS ratio of 2:1 was selected for the ternary mixture co-digestion assays with glycerol supplementation. After defining the most appropriate FW:SS ratio for maximizing the H2 yield, two series of experiments were carried out in the presence of both substrates supplemented with 1% and 3% (v/v) glycerol. A control test with the binary mixture FW:SS at the ratio of 2:1 was repeated for data validation with previous experimental data and comparison with the ternary mixture samples. The increase in the organic load with the addition of glycerol had a positive impact on H2 production when compared to the fermentation without this co-substrate. Moreover, the addition of glycerol promoted an increase in H2 content in the biogas from 36% (FW + SS) to 56.5% and 54% in the 36 h-fermentation experiments with 1% and 3% GL, respectively (Fig. 4 A). Considering an acidogenic fermentation phase lasting less than 2 days, the H2 content in the biogas was quite significant in relation those reported in the literature, typically varying between 18.7 and 60% (Han et al., 2005; Lee and Chung, 2010). No CH4 was detected within the acidogenesis stage. The cumulative H2 volume data was fitted to the modified Gompertz Equation, and the results are shown in Fig. 4B. Table 2 summarizes the modified Gompertz model parameters. The lag phase corresponded to approximately 5.3 and 2.9 h in the hydrogen fermentation tests with 1% and 3% (v/v) of GL, respectively. On the other hand, the estimated lag phase in the control experiment (FW + SS without GL) was 8.1 h. The results indicate that the microbial adaptation period was shorter when glycerol was supplemented to the fermentation medium. The higher the glycerol content, the more the lag phase was reduced. The cumulative hydrogen production ranged within 23.2–28.5 mL in the experiments with glycerol, but amounted only to around 12.2 mL in the control experiment in the absence this co-substrate. After 24 h of fermentation, H2 generation practically stopped in all tested conditions and maximum cumulative production of this gas was reached. The results showed that the glycerol addition can accelerate bacterial growth and therefore the hydrolysis of the substrates, maximizing the productivity of H2. Indeed, higher H2 yields were achieved in the experiment employing ternary mixtures with 1% and 3% GL, corresponding to 140.2 and 177 mL H2/g VS, respectively (Fig. S1A, Supplementary Material). Such values are about 48.2% and 87% higher than that observed in the control experiments (binary mixture of FW + SS) without GL addition (i.e., 94.6 mL H2/g VS). Such results are in agreement with those reported by Fountoulakis and Manios (2009), who evaluated the co-digestion of a mixture of olive mill wastewater and slaughterhouse wastewater (1:4) together with 1% (v/v) glycerol in batch reactors. These authors observed that the H2 yield increased upon addition of glycerol, reaching 15 mL H2/g VS. The maximum hydrogen production rate observed in the co-digestion of FW + SS with 1% and 3% GL reached the peak after 8 h, and amounted to 17 mL H2/(gVS h) and 11.5 mL H2/(gVS h), respectively (Fig. S1B). On the other hand, the maximum specific hydrogen production rate in the control experiment (i.e., 9.8 mL H2/(gVS h)) was only noticed at longer incubation times (12 h). The enhanced H2 production achieved with GL as substrate can be attributed to several factors, such as the increase of simple carbon compounds and the provision of nutrients and micronutrients (phosphorus, nitrogen, calcium and others), which may have stimulated H2-producing bacteria (Thompson and He, 2006; Zahedi et al., 2016). Given the aforementioned characteristics, GL can be directly used for bacterial growth during fermentative processes (Thompson and He, 2006). Silva et al. (2017) reported that the addition of GL to food waste (binary mixture) reduced the period of acclimation of the microorganisms (lag phase), accelerated bacterial growth and consequently enhanced the hydrolysis of the substrates, maximizing H2 production. Besides that, these authors evaluated the GL consumption over the experiments with 1% and 3% GL and related it with H2 production. The use of higher GL content enhanced microbial adaptation to this substrate, led to higher H2 production and, at all conditions tested, the concentration of GL dropped very fast. Consequently, it was completely consumed within the first 8 h of incubation. The same behavior is likely valid for the ternary mixture experiments conducted in the current research. In this first stage of the anaerobic digestion system (acidogenesis), the VS and COD removal efficiency in the experiments with FW + SS + 1%GL and FW + SS + 3%GL did not exceed 10% and 20%, respectively. Such low COD abatement is typically found for the acidogenesis stage of anaerobic digestion, during which the organic compounds are mainly converted into soluble metabolic products (VFA and alcohols) (Cooney et al., 2007). On the other hand, the carbohydrate removal attained after 36 h of fermentation for the same samples was 44.2% and 49%, respectively. The incomplete carbohydrates removal in the acidogenesis phase is possible related to the complex nature of the organic material present in the food residues, mainly composed of fruit, vegetables and meat. Although the residues of fruits and vegetables are mostly composed of readily biodegradable carbohydrates that can be easily converted to H2, they are also made up of bark, roots and other parts which are rich in slowly biodegradable organic compounds (cellulose and lignin), retarding the hydrolysis rate (Pichtel, 2014; Yang et al., 2015). The results also revealed that removal of carbohydrates in the tests with 1 and 3% GL was found to be proportional to the increase in the concentration of glycerol in the fermentation medium, and considerably higher when compared to the control sample (FW + SS) (Fig. 4C). This means that the carbohydrates from glycerol are easily biodegradable, which favors their conversion during anaerobic fermentation. Moreover, the higher the carbohydrate removal, the more H2 was produced. In fact, biogas and hydrogen production was reported to linearly correlate with carbohydrate content of substrates while proteins and lipids, exhibiting up to 20 times lower hydrolysis rate (Lay et al., 2003), did not contribute significantly for their generation (Alibardi and Cossu, 2016). Therefore, promptly biodegradable carbohydrate content represents a key parameter in the identification of suitable wastes (organic fraction of municipal solid waste, food waste or agro-industrial residues) for use in dark fermentation reactors. Fig. 4D illustrates the evolution of the pH during the hydrogen fermentation of the ternary mixture containing food waste, sewage sludge and glycerol. The stability of the acidogenic system was confirmed by the narrow range of pH values, varying from 5 to 5.5. pH values within 5–6 are often considered ideal to avoid methanogenesis and enhance H2 generation (Guo et al., 2010). There were no abrupt pH variations, demonstrating that the acidogenic system was kept stable, favoring microbial activity of hydrogen-producing microorganisms (Zahedi et al., 2016). Cappai et al. (2014) demonstrated that different pH values exert a remarkable influence on hydrogen yields using food waste as substrate. In their work, it was clearly shown that adequate pH control is one of the key factors in hydrogen production through dark fermentation. Given that the remaining organic matter content was substantial, a subsequent methanogenic stage was studied to exploit the energy potential of the non-converted substrate."
8,Second phase of the two-stage anaerobic digestion process: Methane production,"3.2 Second phase of the two-stage anaerobic digestion process: Methane production After 36 h of incubation, H2 production ceased and the acidified effluents from the acidogenesis stage were used as substrate for methanogenesis. The pH of the substrates was adjusted to 7 and all bottles were inoculated with non-pretreated digested sludge for the methane production stage. The results showed that the CH4 content in the biogas remained above 50% in the tests with addition of glycerol (Fig. 5 A), with maximum values close to 80%. As reported in previous investigations, the percentage of CH4 in the biogas resulting from digestion of organic residues and co-digestion of organic residues and sewage sludge in two-stage anaerobic digestion systems under mesophilic conditions varies within 47–80% (Han et al., 2005; Lee and Chung, 2010; Nathao et al., 2013; Siddiqui et al., 2011). The methane production profiles over time (both experimental data and theoretical curves based on modified Gompertz model (Eq. (2.3)) are shown in Fig. 5B. The cumulative methane volume observed in the ternary mixture experiments employing 1% and 3% GL was 451.4 and 285 mL, respectively. On the other hand, it amounted to around 308.6 mL in the control experiment in the absence this co-substrate (Fig. 5B). As indicated in Table 3 , where the modified Gompertz model parameters are displayed, the lag-phase of the methanogenic stage was lower than 24 h, meaning that methane was produced before 1 day of incubation. It is also worth to highlight that in the methanogenic tests with the acidified effluent from the FW + SS + 1%GL mixture, a stable CH4 production was observed during all the monitoring period. Conversely, in the experiment with FW + SS + 3%GL, an abrupt reduction in the biogas CH4 content to less than 20% was observed in the 15th day (Fig. 5A). This consequently reduced the cumulative amount of methane generated within that period (Fig. 5B). Such instability in the methanogenesis process may have occurred due to the metabolic products formed with the addition of higher amounts of glycerol (3%) in the first stage of the anaerobic digestion, as discussed further below. The highest methane yield (i.e., 342 mL CH4/g VS) was achieved with ternary mixture with 1% GL followed by that with 3% GL (224.4 mL CH4/g VS) (Fig. S2A). The CH4 yield obtained with 1% GL represents an increase of 39.5% as compared to that observed for the control test without addition of this co-substrate (245 mL CH4/g VS). It is interesting to note that this pattern is distinct from that observed in the acidogenic phase, in which higher hydrogen yield was noticed in the experiment with the highest glycerol content. The methane production rates observed in the co-digestion of FW + SS with no glycerol (control test), 1% and 3% GL reached the peak at about the fifth day of incubation, amounting to 20.3 mL CH4/(gVS d), 21.7 mL CH4/(gVS d) and 28.8 mL CH4/(gVS d), respectively (Fig. S2B). The pH remained stable within the optimum range (i.e., 7–7.5) (Razaviarani et al., 2013) for CH4 production throughout almost the entire monitoring period of the methanogenic phase, except for the ternary mixture FW + SS + 3%GL, for which a decrease in the pH value to 6.6 was observed on the 15th day of monitoring (Fig. 5D). It is possible to observe that the sharp decrease in pH directly affected the CH4 content in the biogas and the cumulative CH4 volume under these conditions. Concentrations higher than 1% v/v glycerol can result in the accumulation of VFA in the fermentation bottles, which can hamper methanogenic activity and potentially destabilize BMP experiments (Nghiem et al., 2014). As reported for one-stage anaerobic digestion systems, in some cases, the sludge buffering capacity may be sufficient to absorb the additional VFA produced during the co-digestion (Jensen et al., 2014). The adverse effect of VFA accumulation was also noticed by Martín et al. (2013), who studied the anaerobic co-digestion of orange peel waste with residual glycerol (ratio of 1:1 on COD basis) under mesophilic and semi-continuous conditions. These authors observed that the process remained stable at organic loads (expressed in terms of volatile solids) up to 2.1 g VS/L. At higher organic loads, the accumulation of VFA and a decrease in the pH destabilized the process. Fountoulakis et al. (2010) also reported the occurrence of inhibition of the anaerobic co-digestion of residual glycerol and sewage sludge under mesophilic conditions due to the accumulation of volatile fatty acids and consequent decrease in the pH resulting from the increase of glycerol concentration in the mixture. The same authors reported that the increase in glycerol from 1% to 3% in the mixture decreased the pH values from 7.0 to 5.5. Nevertheless, the transitory period of inhibition was followed by a gradual adaptation of the microbial consortium, which was reflected in an increase of methane production in the following days of monitoring. The possible formation of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) during the acidogenic fermentation of the ternary mixture containing FW + SS + 3%GL could have contributed to the higher presence of propionic acid in the residual effluent. The use of higher GL concentrations has been reported to lead to higher yield of H2, being accompanied by the production of 1,3-PDO (Silva et al., 2017). Glycerol degradation in methanogenic systems occurs by the conversion of 1,3-propanediol to propionic acid (Watanabe et al., 2013). Therefore, it is possible that the presence of such acid influenced the CH4 production and caused abrupt changes in the pH of the medium. Investigating the anaerobic digestion of food waste, Izumi et al. (2010) observed that the concentrations of all VFA decreased abruptly within the first 6 days of experiment, except for propionic acid, whose consumption took about 16 days due to its slow degradation. According to Sunyoto et al. (2016), the energy required to anaerobically oxidize propionic acid to acetate (+76.1 kJ/mol) is almost double that required for the formation of butyrate (+48.1 kJ/mol). Thus, the acetate formation rate from propionic acid becomes reduced, and, consequently, a lower CH4 production is achieved. According to Kim et al. (2013a), some studies report that the concentration of propionic acid in one-stage anaerobic digestion systems targeting CH4 production is greater than in the two-stage anaerobic digestion processes designed for both H2 and CH4 generation. Nartker et al. (2014) supplemented glycerol from biodiesel industry to primary sewage sludge aiming at increasing the gas production and methane content in the biogas through a continuous anaerobic co-digestion process. Glycerol was systematically added to the primary digester in proportions varying from 0 to 60% of the total organic loading rate (OLR). Under these conditions, the operation of the digesters remained balanced and stable, and inhibition was only observed when the glycerol load was further increased to 70% of the total OLR. This suggests that high glycerol loads can be handled as long as its supplementation is gradual to allow adaptation of the bacterial community. In the methane production stage, a decrease in the organic matter content at the end of the experiment was noticed for all samples. The removal percentage of COD and VS for the samples FW + SS, FW + SS + 1%GL and FW + SS + 3%GL varied in the range of 49–61% and 41–47%, respectively. Approximately half of the remaining organic matter from the acidogenesis phase was converted or stabilized during methanogenesis. Comparing the samples with 1 and 3%GL, the highest COD removal (60% in average) was observed for samples with lower glycerol addition (Fig. 5C). This result is compatible with those commonly reported in the literature for the treatment of organic residues in two-stage anaerobic digestion systems, which are between 40 and 95% (Chu et al., 2008; Han and Shin, 2004; Liu et al., 2013; Wang and Zhao, 2009). The findings therefore suggest that the soluble and remaining organic matter from the acidogenic stage was efficiently used to produce CH4. Co-digestion of FW, SS and GL was also efficient in terms of protein removal, as more than 70% of this component was removed in sample containing 1%GL. According to Forster-Carneiro et al. (2007), lipids and proteins are ideal substrates for the production of methane, since they are able to generate biogas with higher methane content when compared to carbohydrates. Overall, the results demonstrate the feasibility of using the effluents from the acidogenic phase of anaerobic digestion of ternary mixtures with crude glycerol as substrate for the CH4 production, with good organic matter removal efficiency. Moreover, the results indicate that the use of lower glycerol content (1% (v/v)) for the sequential production of H2 and CH4 in the two-stage anaerobic digestion system led to a better degradation of the organic residues. Consequently, a higher performance in terms of CH4 yield and CH4 content in the biogas was observed as compared to the tests with addition of 3% glycerol. Similar results were reported by Kanchanasuta and Sillaparassamee (2017), who investigated the CH4 production, in a semi-continuous system, using the products resulting from the acidification stage of the co-digestion of palm oil and glycerol (0.75% and 1% v/v, respectively). These authors noticed that a higher CH4 production was achieved at lower GL content (44 L CH4/kg TS). Some authors have reported that organic substrates with higher H2 production potential may result in lower CH4 conversion in two-stage anaerobic digestion systems and vice versa. Thus, experimental conditions that maximize H2 production may not necessarily be beneficial for CH4 production (Alibardi and Cossu, 2015; Chu et al., 2012; Kanchanasuta and Sillaparassamee, 2017; Rafieenia et al., 2017)."
9,"Overall assessment of the two-stage anaerobic digestion system performance: H2, CH4 and energy yields","3.3 Overall assessment of the two-stage anaerobic digestion system performance: H2, CH4 and energy yields The addition of 3%GL to food waste and sewage sludge led to 87% increase in the H2 production as compared to control experiments (FW + SS). The extra carbon and nutrients provided by glycerol significantly improved the carbohydrates hydrolysis and, consequently, the H2 production without causing instability to the anaerobic fermentation system. On the other hand, the acidified effluent sample resulting from the H2-production stage with 1%GL was more efficient in terms of CH4 production. A 39.5% increase in CH4 generation was reached by employing the ternary mixture in relation to the control experiment (FW + SS). An overview of the H2 and CH4 yields by two-stage anaerobic digestion system is shown in Fig. 6 . The most significant results in terms of the combined production of H2 and CH4 production were obtained for the ternary mixture experiments using 1% glycerol. Based on the H2 and CH4 yields obtained in the anaerobic co-digestion assays with glycerol supplementation, the energy yields corresponding to each gram of VS removed were calculated (Table 4 ). The H2 energy efficiency is noticeably lower than that of CH4, since hydrogen offers less energy per volume. Therefore, it can be stated that, in energy terms, the H2 production is not competitive with CH4 generation. Such behavior was evidenced in the work carried out by Zhu et al. (2008b), which used potato waste as substrate in a two-stage mesophilic anaerobic digestion system aimed at hydrogen and methane production. The highest energy recovery in this study was obtained through the co-digestion of FW + SS + 1%GL, proving the positive effect generated by the combination of the three substrates. The total energy yield harvested from this sample was 15.5 kJ/g VS, of which only 11.5% came from H2 production. The standardization of the initial volatile solids concentration in 10 g VS/L in all co-digestion assays allowed a better comparison of the overall energy efficiency of the two-stage H2 and CH4 production with that achieved in a one-stage CH4 production process described by Alves (2016). Assessing the co-digestion of food waste, sewage sludge and glycerol (1% v/v) under similar operating conditions to that of the present study, this author reported a CH4 yield of 352.2 mL CH4/g VS, representing an energy yield of 14 kJ/g VS. In this study, the overall energy yield (considering both the H2 and CH4-related energy) obtained through the two-stage anaerobic digestion of the ternary mixture with 1%GL was 15.5 kJ/g VS. This is 10.7% higher than that reported by Alves (2016). The results indicate, under these substrate conditions, biogas is more efficiently produced in two-stage acidogenesis-methanogenesis process as compared single-stage methanogenesis due to better degradation and conversion of waste organic compounds (Kim et al., 2013a). This is actually in line with previous investigations, showing that more bioenergy can be achieved in two-stage anaerobic digestion processes. Nathao et al. (2013) reported an energy yield 18% higher in a two-stage anaerobic digestion process than that obtained in a one-stage one, whereas Kim et al. (2013a) observed a 59.6% higher energy yield when co-digesting rice straw and crude sewage sludge in a two-stage anaerobic digestion system."
10,Conclusions,"The addition of glycerol (1% and 3% v/v) in the mixture of food waste and sewage sludge efficiently increased the hydrogen and methane production and therefore the energy yield through the two-stage anaerobic digestion process. Stable H2 and CH4 production was observed in the experiments with 1% glycerol throughout the monitoring period. Conversely, the results revealed that the use of higher amounts of glycerol (i.e., 3%) led to process instabilities (pronounced pH and methane yield drops), which are possibly attributed to the accumulation of metabolic products formed during anaerobic digestion. At the end of the two-stage anaerobic digestion process, the highest organic matter removal was obtained in the test with 1% GL (around 77% and 55.4% in terms of COD and SV, respectively). The findings of this study indicate that the separation between the acidogenic and methanogenic phases may be suitable for both the treatment complex wastes with high pollution potential and energetic use of gases produced via anaerobic co-digestion."
