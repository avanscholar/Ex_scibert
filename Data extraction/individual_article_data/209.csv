0,Introduction,"Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) can generate green and cost-effective hydrogen by converting the electrical energy derived from the oxidation of organic matter by microorganisms with limited external energy input (Kadier et al., 2016). The electrical energy recovered from wastewater via anode oxidation is channelled to the cathode for hydrogen production. For this process, the theoretical cell voltage required is only 0.123 V, whereas 1.23 V is required for conventional electrolysers (Rousseau et al., 2020), (Shiva Kumar and Himabindu, 2019). The present of the bioanode could offset the potential needs (starting from −0.2 V vs. SHE) in the biocathode and provide up to 1/3 of the total energy required for the production of hydrogen in an MEC (Lim et al., 2020). Nevertheless, major bottlenecks are still preventing the deployment of MECs. Low current densities generated at the anode and kinetic imbalances between the anode and cathode, and overpotentials are the main limitations apart from preserving and optimising the microbial activity in MECs fully catalysed by microorganisms (Jeremiasse et al., 2010), (Lim et al., 2017). To avoid these limitations and by-product build-up in the anodic and cathodic compartments, recirculation and replacement of the electrolytes is important for maintaining the system (Lim et al., 2020). In addition, optimisation of the feeding mode can also prevent the pH from shifting away from neutral, as the system relies on microorganism catalytic activity. A simple strategy of maintaining pH between 6.4 and 8.4 and avoid drastic fluctuations was demonstrated using a periodic polarity reversal method (Jianget al., 2016). The strategy could limit the medium replacement frequency while increasing hydrogen production by 5.3 times. However, the method required reversal intervals (min. 2 h) to switch the polarity, which might cause a production delay. Another study investigated the impact of different feed modes in overcoming mass transport limitations (Jafaryet al., 2017). In this study, the effects of batch recirculation and flow rate were compared in order to increase mass transport, enhance electrocatalytic reactions on electrode surfaces and limit by-product accumulation. The authors evaluated and compared nine different recirculation batch systems with various recirculation flow rates and reservoir volumes. The highest power density of 36 W m−3 was achieved using a recirculation method with a 0.04 L anode working volume compartment and a medium circulating over 2 L reserve tanks. The results also showed improvements of 40% and 32% of current outputs compared to batch and continuous systems, respectively. The author reported in a later study that hydrogen production can be enhanced under different feeding modes, from 0.17 (batch) to 0.45 (circulation batch) m3 hydrogen m−3 catholyte day−1 at 1.1 applied cell voltage (Jafaryet al., 2019). However, this study did not take into account the impact of the cell voltage on the performance of the system. Experiments have also been conducted to study the impact of the applied potential on the bioelectrodes in half-cell setups. The results showed that the bioelectrodes could only perform oxidation or reduction reactions in a specific range of potentials. The crucial impact of the cathodic potential on hydrogen production was reported by Batlle-Vilanova et al. (Batlle-Vilanovaet al., 2014). The authors applied a range of potentials varying from −0.4 to −1.8 V vs. SHE to a biocathode and reported that the optimal hydrogen production (0.89 ± 0.1 m3 hydrogen m−3 catholyte day−1) was −1.0 V vs. SHE. In fact, the standard potential for proton reduction to hydrogen is −0.41 vs. SHE at pH 7.0 and 25 °C, which means that the overpotential in their study was as high as 0.59 V. On the other hand, bioanode enrichment and biofilm formation are generally carried out at constant applied potentials between −0.6 and + 0.5 V vs. SHE (Santoro et al., 2017). Several studies have confirmed that the bioanode produced maximum current densities at an anodic applied potential of 0 V vs. SHE (Aelterman et al., 2008), (Hari et al., 2016). Based on the literature, a practical applied voltage for a MEC fully catalysed by microorganisms should be 1.0 V vs. SHE. The first proof-of-concept study combining bioanodes and biocathodes for hydrogen production was reported by Jeremiasse et al. (2010). When a range of cell voltages from 0.2 to 0.8 V was applied, the cathodic potential decreased from −0.2 to −0.6 vs. SHE, and current densities increased exponentially from zero to 3.5 A m−2. However, only the biocathode potential vs. current density was presented, and no information about the bioanode potential evolution was given. It has also been reported that maintaining bioanode catalytic activity by controlling its potential, especially to avoid abiotic oxidation reactions, is essential for the biosustainability of the system (Lim et al., 2017). We recently reported that a bioanode could lose its catalytic activity in MEC when the cell voltages higher than 1.2 V were applied (Lim et al., 2020). In this study, a bioanode was subjected to different feeding modes in order to improve its performance in terms of current densities and hydrogen production in a MEC. Batch, fed-batch and continuous feed modes with different flow rates and HRTs were investigated in order to evaluate their impacts on MEC performance. The optimal feed mode was then used in a chronoamperometry test to study the electrochemical behaviour of the bioelectrodes for hydrogen production. A range of applied cell voltages between 0.3 and 1.6 V was used. During the tests, electrode potentials and cell current were monitored in conjunction with hydrogen production, product conversion rate, electrolyte properties and recovery efficiency."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Cell setup and operation,"2.1 Cell setup and operation A microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) was constructed as described by Lim et al. (2020) (see Fig. 1 (a)) using two pieces of clear Perspex with a size of 7 × 7 × 2 cm. The centre part of the Perspex block was removed to create an inner chamber of 5 × 5 × 1 cm (working volume = 25 mL). Two plain carbon felts were used as anode and cathode with a size of 4.8 × 4.8 × 0.2 cm. The projected area of the electrodes was calculated as 25 cm2. Cathode surface (facing to membrane) was coated with 0.5 mg/cm2 Pt as catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and Nafion as chemical binder. A cation exchange membrane (CMI-7000, Membranes International, Inc.) was used as a separator sandwiched between the chambers. An Ag/AgCl reference electrode (RE-5B Ag/AgCl, BASi, USA) was inserted from the top of each chamber. A glass tube with a size of ø 2.54 × 15.5 cm (working volume = 80 mL) was custom-made as described by Lim et al. (2017). It was connected to the top of the cathodic chamber for gas collection. The MECs were set up in duplicate. In addition, a duplicate control experiment was also set up with no voltage applied to the cell. Inocula was collected from a parent microbial fuel cell (MFC) and a control MFC (without resistor connected between anode and cathode) fed with glucose and glutamic acid and operated over a year. The inocula were premix with fresh medium (50% v/v) before injected separately into anode and cathode chambers. The MECs were enriched at a fixed applied cell voltage of 0.3 V under batch conditions. At the beginning, the anodic medium replacement was done for every 24 h when the potential dropped to less than half of its peak value. Along the enrichment process, the replacement was adjusted accordingly to the performance growth up to every 12 h to avoid starvation and longer recovery time. The cathodic medium was replaced once every two cycles of anodic medium replacement. Both the anodic and the cathodic media contained 50 mM PBS at neutral pH. Carbon sources, i.e., 10 mM acetate and 10 mM bicarbonate, were added to the anodic and cathodic media, respectively. A nitrogen source (5 mM ammonium), specific trace elements, and vitamins were also added into the media in accordance with Lim et al. (2020). An additional sulphate source (3 mM) was added into the cathodic media to promote the growth of the biocathodic hydrogen producer, sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB). The MECs had been continuously operated for more than 3 months at the time when this study was initiated."
3,Potential and cell voltage monitoring,"2.2 Potential and cell voltage monitoring As showed in Fig. 1 (b), cell voltage (V1) and anode (V2) and cathode (V3) potentials were monitored using a multichannel data logger (NI-USB-6225, National Instruments, UK) during the experiments. All potential values except applied cell voltage are reported vs. SHE unless stated otherwise."
4,Chronoamperometry under feed modes,"2.3 Chronoamperometry under feed modes A four-channel potentiostat (PS) (Quad, Whistonbrook Technologies, UK) was used to control the cell voltage during the experiments. An applied voltage of 0.9 V was supplied to the MECs during evaluation of the anodic feed modes, i.e., batch, fed-batch and continuous modes, unless stated otherwise. Under batch mode, the anodic medium was replaced manually every 24 h. A peristaltic pump (Watson Marlow 120U/DM3, UK) was used to feed fresh medium into the anodic chamber under fed-batch and continuous modes. Fed-batch mode feedings were performed using a preset on-off timer (Electric Timer Switch ETU17, Timeguard, UK) connected to the peristaltic pump. The timer was set ‘on’ for 10 min for every 6-h gap, and the peristatic pump was set at a flow rate of 3 mL min−1 (HRT = 5 h) unless stated otherwise. No timer was used to control the pump under continuous mode. The medium was continuously fed into the anodic chamber under a flow rate of 0.15 mL min−1 (HRT = 2.78 h). Previous literature has shown that continuous and batch modes produced the same amount of current density (Pannell et al., 2016), (Lay et al., 2015). The reason why lower HRT was chosen for continuous mode compared to fed-batch is to determine whether the HRT could further improve the current density. The purpose of the setting is (a) to determine if higher organic loading rate and fresh electrolyte replacement could produce a better anodic performance, and (b) to evaluate the best control strategy (batch, fed-batch or continuous mode) for bioanode in corresponded to biocathode performance. Fresh cathodic medium was replaced and refilled every 24 h from the top of the gas collector for all three anodic conditions. All experiments were carried out in duplicate at a constant temperature of 26.5 ± 2.5 °C. In the second part of the experiments, chronoamperometry analysis was performed under fed-batch mode. The anode and cathode feeding conditions were similar as described above. A range of voltages between 0.3 and 1.6 V were applied to the MEC. As the tests were focused on the anode performance, each applied voltage was performed in 24 h to obtained four stable and repeatable anodic cycles. The graphs of electrode potentials and current density with respect to applied voltage were plotted. The potentials and current densities were calculated based on the mean value of four anodic cycles."
5,Sample analysis,"2.4 Sample analysis All liquid samples were taken at the end of each chronoamperometry test (24 h) and filtered through 0.2 μm syringe filters in order to remove suspended solids and biomass before measurements. pH and conductivity were measured using a portable pH meter (HI9025 microcomputer pH meter, Hanna Instruments, UK) and conductivity meter (HI 8733, Hanna Instrument, UK), respectively. For total carbon analysis, a total carbon analyser (TOC-5050 A, Shimadzu, UK) equipped with an autosampler (ASI-5000 A, Shimadzu, UK) was used. The total organic/inorganic concentrations are presented as the carbon concentration relative to the carbon dioxide concentration. All values are reported in mg HCO3 − equivalent L−1. The presence of organic compounds was analysed using a gas chromatograph (Tracera GC-2010 Plus, Shimadzu, UK) equipped with a Barrier Ionization Discharge (BID) detector (280 °C) and an autosampler (AOC-20i, Shimadzu, UK). A column (Zebron ZB-WAX-Plus capillary column 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, Phenomenex, UK) was used to separate the compounds. All filtered samples were acidified with 1.0 M HCl at a ratio of 9:1 prior to the analysis. The gas volume produced at the cathodes was measured with a gas collector using the water replacement method, and the actual gas volume was recorded every 24 h. The samples were collected through a septum on the top of the glass tube by using a gas tight syringe (1 MR-GT, SGE Analytical Science) and analysed using a gas chromatograph (GC-8A, Shimadzu) connected to a chart integrator (Chromatopac C-R8A, Shimadzu). Two columns of molecular sieve 5 A (mesh range 40–60) and Chromosorb 101 (mesh range 80–100) were used and operated under isothermal conditions at 40 °C. The carrier gas was research grade 99.999% helium flowing under a pressure of 100 kPa. A thermal conductivity detector was used to detect the gas components (H2, N2, O2, CO2, and CH4) based on their retention times."
6,Production rate and efficiency calculation,"2.5 Production rate and efficiency calculation Cathode hydrogen production was computed as: (1) Q h = V h / ( A cat × t ) where Qh (L H2 m−2 cathode day−1) is the hydrogen production rate, Acat (m2) is the projected cathode surface area (2.544 × 10−3 m2), t (day) is the production time, and Vh (L) is the actual hydrogen volume. The volume Vh was calculated as Vh = Vg × Xh, where Vg (L) is the headspace volume of the gas collected in the glass tube and Xh is the fraction of hydrogen in the gas samples determined from the GC analysis. Qh can also be reported in m 3 H 2 m −3 catholyte day −1 using the formula Qh = (Vh/1000)/(Vcat × t), where Vcat is the catholyte volume (m3) inside the cathodic chamber (chamber operating volume – electrode space = 1.924 × 10−5 m3). The efficiency of the hydrogen recovery from cathode Rcat was calculated as: (2) R cat = Q recovery / Q t × 100 % where Qrecovery (C) = η·F·z is the charge utilised to reduce protons to hydrogen, η is hydrogen produced in mole, F is Faraday constant (96,485 C mol−1), z is the valency number of hydrogen formation which is 2. Meanwhile, Qt (C) = ∫ I (t) dt is total charge supplied from the power supply and anode, or in other term total charge transferred between anode and cathode. The overall energy recovery ηe + s of the system based on hydrogen yield is calculated as: (3) η e + s = W h / ( W e + W s ) × 100 % where Wh, We, and Ws (J) are the energy content of the hydrogen recovered, the supplied electrical energy and the energy released from substrate oxidation, respectively. If other reduced products in the catholyte are considered, then the overall energy efficiency ηtotal is written as: (4) η total = W t / ( W e + W s ) × 100 % where Wt = Wf + Wa + Wb + Wh + Wm. Wf, Wa, Wb and Wm are the energy contents of formate, acetate, butyrate and methane recovered. The standard enthalpies of combustion for hydrogen, formate, acetate and butyrate are −285, −254, −870 and −3545 kJ mol−1, respectively. Therefore, Wf, Wa, Wb, Wh, and Wm were calculated by multiplying the enthalpy values by the total moles of products produced or consumed. We was computed by multiplying the applied voltage value by the total charge flow between the anode and cathode, which is also equal to Qc. Qc (C) = ∫ I (t) dt is the total charge supplied from the power supply and anode, or in other words, the total charge transferred between the anode and cathode. The energy contribution by external power input (ee) and substrate (es) in the system at a specific applied voltage was calculated as (5) e e = W e / ( W e + W s ) × 100 % (6) e s = W s / ( W e + W s ) × 100 %"
7,Microbial community analysis,"2.6 Microbial community analysis After the chronoamperometry analysis, MECs was continuously operated under the fed-batch mode for another 3 months at different (0.3 and 0.9 V) applied voltages. Microbial community analysis was carried out on biocathode samples only. A small sample weighing approximately 0.2 g was trimmed from the centre of each biocathode. DNA was extracted from the sample using a PowerSoil DNA kit (MO BIO, USA). The extracted DNA samples were kept at −20 °C and analysed by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China). The sequencing method and data analysis carried out by the company were similar to Izadi et al., 2021."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Impact of anode feed mode on hydrogen production,"3.1 Impact of anode feed mode on hydrogen production The impacts of the anodic feeding modes on hydrogen production at the cathode were evaluated in this section. The electrode potentials and the hydrogen production rate were recorded as shown in Fig. 2 . Three feed modes with different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) were tested: batch (HRT varied from 24 to 48 h), fed-batch (HRT of 5 h) and continuous (HRT of 2.78 h) modes. As illustrated in Fig. 2 (a), the first batch cycle (24 h: Day 0–1) ended within 24 h after the medium was replaced, while the second batch cycle (48 h: Day 1–3) was extended to 48 h. The second batch cycle was purposely extended to study the impact on the bioanode when the substrate was depleted. The time needed for the bioanode potential to return to its initial value (i.e., for the bioanode to recover) was longer after the second cycle. This result shows that the time needed for recovery is proportional to the depletion period, which is known to be detrimental to microbes and can change the entire bioanode community balance (Ruiz et al., 2015). Indeed, the relative abundance of electrogenic microorganisms might decrease during the depletion period and affect electricity production after recovery (Saheb-Alam et al., 2019). As shown in Fig. 2 (a), peak current densities increased from 1.3 to 2.5 A m−2 when the feed mode was switched from batch to fed-batch (Day 3 to Day 4), and the HRT decreased to 5 h. Consistent fed-batch feedings had a positive impact on the bioanode potential, which remained stable at −0.2 V vs. SHE. A similar impact was observed on the biocathode potential, which stabilised at −1.1 V vs. SHE. Despite the stable potential profiles, significant variations in the current density associated with the fed-batch mode were observed. When the feed mode was switched from fed-batch to continuous (HRT 2.8 h), a more constant current density was measured, which plateaued at 2.3 A m−2. More stable potential profiles were also noticed under continuous mode. The applied voltage was set at 1.0 V for the first part of the tests from batch to fed-batch mode and at 0.9 V for the second part from fed-batch to continuous mode. Slight changes of current density (−0.10 A m−2) and potentials (anode: +0.05 V, cathode: 0.05 V) were noticed after the switch. In a similar study, bioanode feed was also controlled and recirculated from a reservoir (2 L vs. 40 mL anodic chamber) to maximise the operating volume and minimise the mass transport limitation, which in turn increased the oxidation reaction by approximately 3.6 times (Jafaryet al., 2017). As presented in Fig. 2 (b), the hydrogen production rate was not recorded at the beginning of the experiment under batch mode (Days 0–3). This is because no gas sample was collected under the batch feed mode. A remarkable hydrogen production rate was observed when the anode feed mode was switched from batch to fed-batch. However, an overshoot hydrogen production rate was observed immediately after the beginning of the switch (day 5: 22.7 ± 2.6 L m−2 cathode day−1). The value was almost two times higher than the average hydrogen production rate for the days after (day 6–11: 12.6 ± 0.4 L m−2 cathode day−1 or 0.32 ± 0.01 m3 hydrogen m−3 catholyte day−1). The operation of the bioanode under specific feedstock properties, such as low substrate concentration and low medium conductivity, is the likely explanation (Winfield et al., 2011). reported that anolytes with low feedstock (1 vs. 20 mM acetate) and conductivity values (100 vs. 1500 μS) can cause a power overshoot in a mature bioanode. In addition, the authors also reported that the same phenomenon occurred when a bioanode originally developed in a neutral environment was suddenly exposed to pH 3.0 for 24 h. However, when the same pH and conductivity tests were run on the cathode, the overshoot phenomenon did not occur unless a low power output was observed. In a later study, Kim et al. (2017) found that the overpotential created by electron depletion in a bioanode is the main factor in the power overshoot occurrence. In their observations, the power overshoot became significant when the anodic overpotential was greater than the cathodic overpotential. In present study, when anodic feed was switched from fed-batch to continuous mode (Days 12–14) with a lower HRT (5–2.78 h), hydrogen production rate was further increased to 14.6 ± 0.8 L m−2 cathode day−1 (or 0.37 ± 0.02 m3 hydrogen m−3 catholyte day−1). The purpose of the higher feed rate is meant to maintain bioanode condition (e.g., pH and conductivity) and mass transport limitation (e.g., provide constant substrate concentration). The strategy has been proved effective to increase the bioanode performance. Lay et al. (2015) studied anode fed-batch and continuous modes under a range of recirculation rates between 1.2 and 7.2 times the reactor volume per hour in an up-flow microbial fuel cell. They found that cell performance was strongly correlated with the anodic recirculation rate. Recirculation not only increases anodic mass transfer but also proton transfer through the membrane, thus leading to lower internal resistance. In addition, the authors also reported that the bioanode performance was higher and optimised under the fed-batch mode. In a similar study, Panell et al. (Pannell et al., 2016) reported that low current density and limited anode efficiency were associated with limited substrate diffusion to the bioanode. In their study, no significant current (5.8 ± 0.06 A m−2) difference was noticed whether the bioanode was operated under fed-batch mode or continuous mode; however, the conversion efficiency was better under the continuous mode (39%) than under the fed-batch mode (19%). The authors suggested that the continuous feeding mode increases substrate supply and hence more rapidly maximises the current that the bioanode can generate. Another study showed that imposing recirculation and decreasing HRT could enhance the hydrogen production rate and cathodic recovery from 0.14 to 0.45 m3 hydrogen m−3 catholyte day−1 and 56–65%, respectively (Jafaryet al., 2019). The anode feed mode can increase microbial electrochemical cell performance, especially when the bioanode is the main power support. However, in this study, the continuous mode corresponded to an HRT of 2.78 h, which was almost two times lower than the fed-batch mode HRT (5 h). No significant improvement was observed on the hydrogen production rate operated due to the limited effect of fluid dynamics to reduce mass transfer resistance under continuous mode. Besides, the continuous mode required two times more electrolyte than the fed-batch mode, while the hydrogen production rate was only increased by 15% (fed-batch: 12.6 ± 0.4 vs. continuous: 14.6 ± 0.8 L m−2 cathode day−1). Considering the trade-off between the medium volume requirement and the hydrogen production rate, the fed-batch feed mode with an HRT of 5 h was chosen for the second part of the study."
10,Chronoamperometry tests under fed-batch mode,"3.2 Chronoamperometry tests under fed-batch mode Further experiments were conducted to assess the improvement of the anode performance using the fed-batch feed mode described in the previous section. A range of cell voltages was applied between 0.3 and 1.6 V and the electrochemical properties and hydrogen production rates were followed, as shown in Fig. 3 . Fig. 3 (a) shows that the anode and cathode potentials diverged from each other when the applied cell voltage increased from 0.3 to 1.6 V. Interestingly, there are three noteworthy potential regions that can be identified from the figure. These regions are: (i) the cathode activation region (0.3–0.8 V), (ii) transition region (0.8–1.1 V) and (iii) anode limitation region (1.1–1.6 V). (i) Cathode activation region: in the cathode activation region (0.3–0.8 V), the cathode potential started to decrease from −0.6 to −1.0 V with the assistance of the external power supply. Moreover, the anode potential remained stable at −0.3 V for applied voltages between 0.3 and 0.5 V but slightly increased to −0.26 V at 0.7 V applied voltage. The results are in agreement with the current density and hydrogen production observed in Fig. 3 (b) and (c). For applied voltages between 0.3 and 0.5 V, the current densities were negligible except at 0.7 V, at which the current density was 0.52 A m−2. The cathode potential at applied voltages of 0.3 and 0.5 V also showed sluggish performance in terms of current densities and hydrogen production, as the reduction potential at the cathode remained insufficient to drive the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, a small amount of hydrogen (0.26 dm m−2 day−1) was detected at an applied voltage of 0.7 V, as presented in Fig. 3 (c). (ii) Transition region: in the transition region (0.8–1.1 V), the cathode potential reached its lowest point of −1.13 V when the cell voltage increased from 0.7 to 1.0 V, as shown in Fig. 3 (a). In this region, the anode potential slightly increased from −0.26 to −0.15 V. The potential increase was due to the requirement for the anode to produce more energy through the oxidation reaction to support cathodic hydrogen production when the cathode had reached an adequate reduction potential (−1.13 V). The maximum current density (2.38 A m−2; see Fig. 3 (b)) and hydrogen production rate (12.1 dm hydrogen m−2 cathode day−1; see Fig. 3 (c)) in this region were measured at an applied cell voltage of 1.0 V. In our previous study, we conducted a similar chronoamperometry test by feeding the bioanode every 24 h (Lim et al., 2020). However, the production rate in this previous test was two times lower (5.9 dm hydrogen m−2 cathode day−1) than that in this study. Therefore, increasing the anodic feeding rate can directly enhance the biocathode performance in terms of current density and hydrogen production. Nevertheless, the total feeding volume in this study was four times higher (HRT 5 vs. 24 h) than that in the abovementioned study. In real applications, low HRTs could provide more substrate to the bioanode and lead to more wastewater being treated (Cao et al., 2019). However, this would vary on a case-by-case basis depending on the bioanode capability and the wastewater organic composition and concentrations (Fazli et al., 2018). (iii) Anode limitation region: in the anode limitation region (1.1–1.6 V), the current density and hydrogen evolution dropped slightly after the external applied voltage was further increased from 1.0 to 1.6 V. In contrast to what was observed in the cathode activation region, the cathode potential remained stable at −1.13 V, while the anode potential steadily increased from −0.15 to +0.46 V (Fig. 3 (a)). At this point, the cathode reached its optimal potential to support the hydrogen evolution reaction. The reduction potential was at the lowest point that could support water reduction into hydrogen. Therefore, increasing the applied voltage beyond 1.1 V only resulted in forcing the anode potential to rise, while the cathode potential was limited by its catalytic activity. The loss of energy via overpotentials caused a decrease in the current density. The increases in anode potential at applied cell voltages higher than 1.1 V led to a loss of catalytic activity, resulting in a drop in the current densities measured and in turn in the hydrogen produced (see Fig. 3 (b) and (c)). Indeed, when the applied voltage was increased from 1.0 to 1.6 V, the current density dropped from 2.38 to 2.09 A m−2, while the hydrogen production rate decreased from 12.1 to 9.3 dm hydrogen m−2 cathode day−1. At high applied cell voltages, abiotic reactions such as water electrolysis overtake biocatalytic activity at the anode, which is detrimental to the biofilm (Lim et al., 2017). Our previous study showed that the viability of the bioanode can be severely hindered by abiotic reactions when the anode potential reaches +1.0 V (applied cell voltage = 2.0 V) (Lim et al., 2020)."
11,Electrolyte properties,"3.3 Electrolyte properties Fig. 4 shows the anodic and cathodic electrolyte properties, including pH, conductivity, total organic and inorganic carbon, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) compound concentrations. The samples were collected and taken at the end of each chronoamperometry analysis (at 24 h). According to Fig. 4 (a), the pH changed less significantly at the anode (ΔpH 1.5) than at the cathode (ΔpH 4.0) over the course of the experiment. It can be assumed that the feed mode limited the accumulation of by-products (e.g., H+, CO2) in the anodic compartment, thus preventing the pH from diverging from its initial value and maintaining the catalytic activity of the bioanode. In contrast, due to the much higher HRT at the cathode, an important pH change was observed, as previously reported in studies focusing on dual-chamber BESs (Jianget al., 2016), (Kyazzeet al., 2010). As shown in Fig. 4 (b), the conductivity values of both electrolytes diverged from 7.8 to 5.5 at the anode (−27%) and 10.0 mS cm−1 cathode (+25%), respectively. In addition to the changes in pH, the change of conductivity can also be attributed to changes in the composition of the electrolytes in terms of organic and inorganic compounds produced and degraded and/or washed-out during the experiment (Tremouli et al., 2017). For example, acetate was used as a carbon source at the anode but also contributed to the anodic conductivity (Zhaoet al., 2017). In their study, when the acetate was consumed and oxidised to protons and CO2, the conductivity value decreased. In this study, the pH and conductivity shifts were mainly significant only at high applied cell voltages, i.e., in the anode limitation region as referred to in Fig. 3 (a). As depicted in Fig. 4 (a), the changes in pH and conductivity occurred within the transition region, in which the catalytic activities of the anode and cathode were maximal and in which the highest current densities and hydrogen production rates were reached (Fig. 3 (b) and (c)). Fig. 4 (c) and (d) show the total inorganic and organic carbon contents in the anolyte and catholyte in relation to the applied voltages. It should be noted that acetate was used as the sole carbon source at the anode and that no acetate crossover from the anode to the cathode was observed during the experiment (data not shown). On one hand, the organic carbon results depicted in Fig. 4 (c) show that the acetate consumption at the end of anodic cycle started to increase in the transition region (0.7–1.2 V) before reaching a plateau in the anode limitation region (≥1.2 V), with a decrease from 650 to 200 mg L−1. On the other hand, the inorganic carbon concentration remained constant at approximately 600 mg L−1 throughout the experiment despite the increases in applied voltage. The inorganic carbon content in the catholyte (Fig. 4 (d)) increased, exhibiting the opposite trend as the consumption of organic carbon observed at the anode (Fig. 4 (c)). The acetate was consumed and oxidised to protons and carbon dioxide, which contributed to the inorganic concentration measured in the catholyte (see Rousseau et al., 2020). The dissolved carbon dioxide (e.g., HCO3−, CO3 2−) was transferred from the anode to the cathode through the CEM, which is not effective in blocking anion crossover resulting ionic transport activated by electrical polarity between anode and cathode when higher voltages were applied. The same observation was also reported in our previous study (Lim et al., 2020). The organic carbon concentration in the catholyte remained at 25 mg L−1 in the cathodic activation region (≤0.7 V), followed by a small increment to 40 mg L−1 in the transition region due to the formation of a small quantity of organic compounds and a plateau in the anode limitation region. Organic compounds present in the catholyte were analysed to determine fatty acid contents. Fig. 4 (e) depicts the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) contents produced during the chronoamperometry analysis. Small acetate (maximum concentration 13.5 mg L−1 at 1.0 V) and butyrate (maximum concentration 21.0 mg L−1 at 1.4 V) concentrations built up as the applied voltage increased, especially between 0.3 and 1.0 V. Formate was first detected at low applied voltages (cathode activation region) followed by acetate (transition and anode limitation regions) and butyrate (anode limitation region) at higher applied voltages. The acetate concentration decreased to zero as the butyrate concentration increased at higher applied voltages (anode limitation region). It is suggested that chain elongation may have occurred at the higher applied voltages. Formate (C1) could be used as an electron donor addition to the cathode to form acetate (C2), which would be further elongated to produce butyrate (C4). The chain elongation process has been reported in several studies when a biocathode was operated for a long period of time with cathode potentials below −0.8 V (Raes et al., 2017; Jourdin et al., 2018; Vassilevet al., 2018). Nevertheless, the concentrations of acetate and formate in this study were lower than expected (<100 ppm). An elongation mechanism was reported when higher formate or acetate concentrations (e.g., >1000 ppm) were detected. Although the cathodic cycle (days vs. weeks) was short, pH could also have been the cause of the low concentrations that inhibited the chain elongation process. In most prior studies, the cathodic pH was controlled at neutral or less than 7.0; however, in this study, the pH increased to as high as 11.0 (see Fig. 4 (a)) at applied voltages above 0.9 V. As depicted in Fig. 4 (d), the crossover of CO2 from anode to cathode provided a carbon source for the biocathode to produce SCFAs. SCFAs and alcohols have generally been found in addition to hydrogen production in microbial electrosynthesis cells (MSCs) when CO2 is present as a carbon source (Vassilevet al., 2018; Ganigué et al., 2015; Bajracharya et al., 2017; Song et al., 2019). In addition to the liquid products, a trace amount of methane was also detected through GC analysis (Fig. 3 (c)). Interestingly, the methane production was considerable small during the chronoamperometry analysis after more than three months of bioelectrode cultivation. Even though the catholyte was rich in hydrogen and CO2 during the cathodic hydrogen production, methanogenesis was under control due to the high pH (>11.0) in the cathode. The hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was favourable than acetolactic routes under alkaline conditions (pH > 9.0) but significantly inhibited for pH over 12.0 (Wormald et al., 2020). Methanobrevibacter sp. was found with less than 1.0% abundance in our biocathodes (Fig. 6 (b)). The species was responsible to the presence of methane in the biocathodes (See Section 3.5 for further discussion)."
12,Energy recovery and input,"3.4 Energy recovery and input Fig. 5 presents the energy recovery and input for the MEC. Based on the data in Fig. 5 (a), the overall energy recovery (calculated as hydrogen yield in terms of Joules), ηe + s, increased from 0 to 90% when the applied voltage was increased from 0.3 to 1.0 V. The energy recovery decreased to 48% when the applied voltage was further increased from 1.0 to 1.6 V. A similar trend was observed for the beginning of the cathodic hydrogen recovery (total electrical charge recovered as hydrogen), Rcat, which increased from 0 to 94% when the applied voltage was increased from 0.3 to 1.0 V. However, the Rcat value remained stable when higher voltages were applied (1.0–1.6 V). Jafaryet al. (2019) reported cathodic hydrogen efficiencies of 56 and 65% with hydrogen production rates of 0.17 and 0.45 m3 hydrogen m−3 catholyte day−1, respectively, under anodic batch and batch circulation operation. In their study, the authors applied a fixed voltage of 1.1 V for all experiments. Xu et al. (2014) reported a coulombic efficiency of 63%, cathodic hydrogen recovery of 37%, and energy input percentage of the power supply of 67% for a membraneless MFC fully catalysed by microorganisms. The authors also conducted that study using a single applied voltage of 0.9 V. In our study, Rcat and ηe + s are presented under a range of applied voltages of 0.3–1.6 V. Rcat indicates the effectiveness of the MEC, especially of the cathode, in producing hydrogen. The Rcat trend was different from the ηe + s trend, as the calculation also considers the energy recovery from the substrate. As shown in Fig. 4 (c), substrate consumption was increasing as the applied voltage was increased from 0.3 to 1.6 V and presumably provided more energy to the MEC for hydrogen production. However, as depicted in Fig. 3 (b), no further increment could be observed in the current density after 1.0 V. This provides evidence that no extra electrical charge was transferred from the anode to the cathode. The use of a bioanode contributed to the reduction in external energy required to produce hydrogen in the cathode. Similar overestimated results were also observed by Lim et al. (2020), who calculated recovery values Rcat using total electrical charge and enthalpy of combustion. Conventional water electrolysis, i.e., using proton exchange membranes or alkaline electrolysis to produce industrial-scale hydrogen, has an electrical recovery efficiency of 70–80% (Shiva Kumar and Himabindu, 2019). The bioanode used in MECs plays an important role in reducing the energy required from the external power supply. At the optimal hydrogen production rate at 1.0 V applied voltage (in the transition region), the energy contribution from substrate oxidation (bioanode) was 35%, while the remaining 65% was provided by a power supply (Fig. 5 (b)). There was only a 3% increase in the overall energy recovery values when short-chain fatty acids and methane were taken into consideration (see Supplementary data: Figure S 2). The results confirm that hydrogen was the main product in this study despite the CO2 crossover from the anode to the cathode."
13,Microbial community,"3.5 Microbial community The microbial communities of the biocathodes operated at different applied voltages are presented in Fig. 6. At the time of the analysis, the communities were kept stable for at least 3 months under the anode fed-batch mode with a specific applied voltage (0.3 or 0.9 V) condition. Fig. 6 (a) shows that 80% of the community of all samples (controls, 0.3 and 0.9 V) was Proteobacteria, and that the next most abundant phyla in order Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Chloroflexi, which together comprised 95% of the community. The high abundance of Proteobacteria is consistent with the presence of electrochemically active species, as reported in several BES studies (Hari et al., 2016), (Cao et al., 2019), (Croese et al., 2011). Within these phyla, Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltaproteobacteria were found to be abundant at the class level Fig. 6 (b)). However, no specific pattern could be obtained from the abundance of these classes in Control 2; meanwhile in Control 1, Beta- and Deltaproteobacteria were abundant. In contrast, Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria were dominant in the 0.3 V samples, and Alpha-, and Deltaproteobacteria were dominant in the 0.9 V samples. Deltaproteobacteria is the cluster mainly consisting of gram-negative, ferric-iron and sulphur reducers. As both reducers are well-known electrochemically active microbes, the high abundance of Deltaproteobacteria, especially in 0.9 V samples is consistent with the bioelectrochemical activity of the biocathodes at this cell voltage. Further inspection at the order Fig. 6 (c)) and family Fig. 6 (d)) levels revealed that the community further converged into specific subclusters: Rhizobiales (Alpha-), Rhodocyclales and Burkholderiales (Betaproteobacteria), Pseudomonadales (Gammaproteobacteria) and Desulfovibrionales (Deltaproteobacteria). All these species are important microbes in biocathodes with distinct functions, as different communities are enriched at the applied voltage conditions. In summary, strict anaerobes such as nitrogen-fixing and ammonia-oxidising microbes (Zhanget al., 2011), (Al-Mamun et al., 2016) are dominant in biocathodes at a low applied voltage (0.3 V), while sulphur-reducing bacteria (Croese et al., 2011), (Luoet al., 2020) are dominant at a higher applied voltage (0.9 V). Strict aerobes and nitrogen-fixing or ammonia-oxidising species such as Nitrobacter, Achromobacter (Zhanget al., 2011), Pseudomonas (Zafar et al., 2019), Sphingobacterium, Acinetobacter (Rabaeyet al., 2008), and denitrifying bacteria (Al-Mamun et al., 2016), (Srinivasan et al., 2016) and unclassified species (Milner et al., 2016) have been found to be dominant biocathodes supplied with nitrate or ammonium and oxygen and operated under a microbial fuel cell mode (i.e., with a cathode potential ≥ −0.2 V according to an MFC bioanode limitation). These exoelectrogens were also found in our system Fig. 6 (b)) when the cathode potential was −0.6 V (i.e., at 0.3 V applied voltage) (see Fig. 3 (a)). Nevertheless, when the cathode potential was lowered to −1.1 V (by further increasing the applied voltage to 0.9 V) the community evolved, and Desulfovibrio sp. dominated the biocathode community. The results were aligned with previous studies that reported on hydrogen-producing biocathodes under a common cathodic environment: an anaerobic, sulphate-containing, and low potential (<−0.4 V vs. SHE) condition (Croese et al., 2011), (Luoet al., 2020), (Pisciotta et al., 2012). Similar observations were found by the network-based taxonomy classification as depicted in Fig. 6 (c) and (d) (only phylum and genus were shown; see Supplementary data: Figure S 4 for a complete information). Proteobacteria appeared as the main cluster and was followed by Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, which had similar connections (Fig. 6 (c)). Biocathodes under similar operating conditions (controls, 0.3 and 0.9 V applied voltages, respectively) tended to converge into the same groups (comprised of similar mixtures of communities). The groups moved closer when it came to more detailed classifications at the class level. Finally, the applied voltage groups (0.3 and 0.9 V) separated from the control group but converged closer to each other at the order, family and genus levels (Fig. 7 (d)), suggesting that the tuning of the community was dependent on the applied voltage condition. Fig. 7 is the proposed electron flow and metabolic pathway for an SRB dominating biocathode operated under alkaline condition. Five pathways namely electrolysis (abiotic), bioelectrolysis (biotic hydrogen production), electrosynthesis, methanogenesis, and nitrogen cycle have been proposed to explain the hydrogen evolution along with oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, and short chain fatty acid production. In the bioelectrolysis process, the main product, hydrogen, was produced by SRB at applied voltage of 0.9 V with the cathodic potential of −1.1 V vs. SHE. The SBR growth was considered sulphate dependent under a low sulphate concertation (3 mM) (Limet al., 2018). Therefore, energy was conserved via sulphate reduction reaction that coupled with the hydrogen production through a membrane bound enzyme, hydrogenase. At the end of cathodic cycle (24 h), pH raised from 7.5 to 10.6 due to the proton removal in catholyte (see Fig. 4 (a)). As the cathodic potential was lower than standard hydrogen evolution potential at the same pH (E’ of H+/H2 at pH 10.6 is −0.63 V vs. SHE), abiotic hydrogen evolution (abiotic process) could occur at the cathode surface. The abiotic/biotic ratio in hydrogen production increased when lower cathodic potential was applied. In our previous study (Lim et al., 2017) under the same cathodic condition, biotic hydrogen started to evolve (2.0 L m−2 day−1) at −0.9 V vs. SHE while only trace amount of abiotic hydrogen was detected on a control (plain carbon felt). The abiotic hydrogen (3.0 L m−2 day−1) was increased up to 41% of the total hydrogen produced in the biocathode (7.3 L m−2 day−1) when the cathodic potential was fixed at −1.0 V vs. SHE. A hydrogen-rich environment was created in the cathode as hydrogen production increased. Trace amount of methane was detected along with hydrogen in gas samples. The methanogenesis (optimal pH is between 6 and 8) was inhibited by high pH in the cathode and less than 0.009 L m−2 day−1 was recorded from the chronoamperometry analysis (see Fig. 3 (c)). Apart from methanogens, other non-SRB could also use the hydrogen as reducing power for growth and cause energy loss in the MEC (see Fig. 5 (a)). A 10% total energy lost was estimated at 0.9 V applied voltage condition. Besides the methane, trace amount of N2 and O2 was also detected in the gas samples resulting from ammonia oxidation. Anmmomia-oxidisng, nitrifying and denitrifying were found in the biocathode community (see Fig. 6). Zhan et al. (Zhanet al., 2014) reported active ammonia oxidation activity produced significant nitrogen (15 mL in 5 days) as by-product in their electricity generating bioanode. In our case, however, the nitrogen cycle bacteria were found in biocathode with a very low abundance (Fig. 6 (b)) because of the unfavourable cathodic condition and high pH environment. Short-chain fatty acids (formate, acetate, butyrate) were also detected in the catholyte samples with a maximum concentration 21 mg L−1 (see Fig. 4 (e)). Based on the results, bioelectrosynthesis was occurred in the biocathode community either via directly electron transfer from cathode or Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (conversion of hydrogen and carbon dioxide to acetate)."
14,Conclusions,"The performance of microbial electrolysis cells fully catalysed by microorganisms was improved by controlling the anode feed mode in conjugation with the HRTs. Under anodic batch mode (HRT of 24 h), no hydrogen production was recorded. Substrate depletion due to high HRT was the main factor contributing to the low performance of the bioanode. The performance of the bioanode was enhanced when the feed mode was switched from batch to fed-batch mode (HRT of 5 h). The averaged hydrogen production rate was 12.6 ± 0.4 L m−2 cathode day−1 (0.32 ± 0.01 m3 hydrogen m−3 catholyte day−1) in the fed-batch mode. Under the continuous mode (HRT of 2.78 h), the production rate was further increased by 15%, reaching 14.6 ± 0.8 L m−2 cathode day−1 (0.37 ± 0.02 m3 hydrogen m−3 catholyte day−1). However, this small increase in the production rate required 2.14 times more electrolyte. Hence the fed-batch mode of HRT of 5 h was selected as optimal. A range of cell voltages between 0.3 and 1.6 V was applied to an MEC fully catalysed by microorganisms under the anode fed-batch mode. Based on the chronoamperometry results, three regions were identified, exhibiting differences in terms of catalytic activity of each bioelectrode, namely, the cathode activation (0.3 – 0.8 V), transition (0.8 – 1.1 V), and anode limitation (1.1 – 1.6 V) regions. The maximum hydrogen production and averaged current density recorded were 12.1 ± 2.1 L m−2 cathode day−1 (or 0.40 ± 0.06 m3 hydrogen m−3 catholyte day−1) and 2.38 ± 0.61 A m−2, respectively at 1.0 V applied voltage. Nevertheless, the maximum current density was reached at 1.2 V applied voltage with a value of 2.50 ± 0.18 A m−2. The maximum hydrogen production was recorded within the transition region and not necessarily at the highest current density. At lower applied voltages (<0.8 V), the cathode was unable to perform water reduction due to higher positive potentials, while at higher applied voltages (>1.1 V), organic substrate oxidation was hindered by competitive abiotic reactions. PH and conductivity remained the main factors limiting the performance of dual-chamber MECs. The change in pH value was more important inside the cathodic chamber, increasing from pH 7.5 to 11.5, versus a decrease from pH 7.0 to 6.5 at the anode. It can be assumed that the pH shift at the anode was alleviated by feed control. The conductivity also experienced changes in the anode and cathode, varying by −27 and + 25%, respectively. High cathodic efficiency (based on total electrical charge recovered as hydrogen) was maintained above 81% at applied voltages greater than 1.0 V. However, maximum energy recovery (based on enthalpy of combustion) only occurred at 1.0 V applied voltage with a value of 90.3%, of which 34.8% was contributed by substrate oxidation from the bioanode."
