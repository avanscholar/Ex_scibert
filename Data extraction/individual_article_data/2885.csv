0,Introduction,"Enantiopure epoxides are used as chiral building blocks for synthesizing various fine chemicals including pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and functional polymers. There are many approaches that can be used to synthesize chiral epoxides. 1 In particular, the asymmetric epoxidation of prochiral alkenes to their corresponding epoxides is a straightforward method for producing enantiomerically enriched epoxides. 2 The Sharpless epoxidation is an efficient enantioselective method for oxidizing allylic alcohols using a titanium/tartrate/tert-butyl hydroperoxide system. 3 Many chemical catalysts containing transition metals, such as metal–salen complexes and chiral metalloporphyrins, have been developed for the enantioselective epoxidation of alkenes. 4–8 The biological production of epoxides using monooxygenases or cytochrome P-450s has also been studied. 9–12 The biological synthesis of epoxides has several advantages over chemical synthesis, such as superior chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and enantioselectivity, and better environmental sustainability. Styrene monooxygenase (SMO), which is involved in styrene degradation in some microorganisms, has been well studied as a biocatalyst for producing epoxides. 13–15 SMO consists of two enzymes: flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent monooxygenase (SMOA) and a flavin oxidoreductase (SMOB). SMO catalyzes the epoxidation of styrene and its derivatives to their corresponding (S)-epoxides with high enantioselectivity, using NADH as an electron donor. 11,13 Some SMO genes have been isolated and their substrate specificities investigated. Most SMOs have shown broad substrate specificities toward substituted styrene derivatives and heterocyclic styrene analogues with excellent enantiomeric excess. 14–16 Furthermore, it was reported that the SMO of Pseudomonas sp. catalyzed the epoxidation of unconjugated alkenes such as 1-allylbenzene as well as conjugated styrene derivatives. 17,18 Recently, we have reported the isolation and characterization of styrene-assimilating bacteria, Rhodococcus sp. ST-5 and ST-10. 19,20 Furthermore, we have cloned the novel SMO coding genes, expressed them in Escherichia coli (E. coli), and characterized them. 21,22 Herein we report a bioproduction system for synthesizing various chiral (S)-epoxides using a recombinant E. coli biocatalyst, which contains Rhodococcus sp. ST-10 SMO and Leifsonia sp. alcohol dehydrogenase (LSADH). 23 LSADH regenerates NADH using 2-propanol and supplies NADH for the SMO epoxidation reaction. The biocatalyst exhibited a broad substrate specificity for various aromatic, heteroaromatic, and aliphatic alkenes, and for sulfides, and produced the corresponding chiral epoxides and sulfoxides with superior enantiomeric excesses (ee)."
1,Results and discussion,
2,Biocatalyst preparation,"2.1 Biocatalyst preparation The FAD-dependent monooxygenase (styA) and flavin oxidoreductase (styB) SMO genes from Rhodococcus sp. ST-10 and the LSADH gene (lsadh) were successfully expressed in E. coli transformant cells, and were used as biocatalysts for the production of epoxides (Fig. 1 ). In order to regenerate NADH, LSADH was used because it exhibits high activity and solvent tolerance in the presence of 15% 2-propanol as the hydrogen donor. 24 An aqueous/organic biphasic reaction system was used for the conversion of styrene, because styrene oxide is unstable under aqueous conditions. Table 1 shows that the highest production level of styrene oxide (150mM) was obtained by using the E. coli biocatalyst, which contains SMO and LSADH in the presence of 2-propanol. Under the same conditions, a negligible amount of product was obtained by using the host and control E. coli cells possessing pET-ST10styAB or pETDuet-LSADH only (Table 1). The E. coli cells possessing pET-ST10styAB produced a small amount of styrene oxide (29.3mM) in the presence of glucose as an energy source, although the yield was much lower than that of the SMO–LSADH co-expression system with 2-propanol. The results indicate that LSADH effectively regenerated NADH in comparison with the internal NADH regeneration process in the cells. Moreover, the addition of 2-propanol to the reaction mixture increases the (S)-styrene oxide productivity. This may be because 2-propanol increases substrate solubility in the aqueous phase as well as the membrane permeability of the E. coli cells, which improves the accessibility of the biocatalyst to the styrene substrate. This has previously been observed for the asymmetric bioreduction of ketones by LSADH with 2-propanol. 25"
3,Optimization of the biocatalyst reaction conditions,"2.2 Optimization of the biocatalyst reaction conditions The biotransformation of organic compounds often suffers from low productivity, because of the low solubility of substrates and products in the aqueous phase and their toxicity to the biocatalysts. These problems can be overcome by using an aqueous/organic biphasic system with biocatalysts. Panke et al. have used bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (BEHP) as an organic carrier solvent for the production of (S)-styrene oxide with recombinant Pseudomonas SMO. 26–28 The organic solvent and concentration of 2-propanol in the biphasic reaction were optimized for our process, based on the production of (S)-styrene oxide. Table 2 shows that the production levels of styrene oxide after 12h varied greatly depending on the organic solvent used, although the ee values of (S)-styrene oxide were not affected (>99%, data not shown). The highest production of (S)-styrene oxide was obtained when octyl acetate was used as the organic phase. Acetate esters, including pentyl, hexyl, and octyl acetate, showed higher production levels than other solvents, whereas negligible amounts of the product were observed when using methyl, ethyl, and propyl acetate. This suggests that the 1-octanol/water partition coefficient (log P ow) of the solvents, which is an indicator of their biocompatibility and solubility in water, 29 strongly influenced the production of styrene oxide. The production level decreased for solvents below a log P ow value of 1.7. However, additional factors influenced the production level. We have previously reported that the Rhodococcus sp. ST-10 SMO is strongly inhibited by styrene and styrene oxide. 22 Therefore, we speculated that partitioning the substrate and the product in the aqueous phase may be a more significant factor than the organic solvent. The highest production was observed with octyl acetate. Therefore, it was used for further experiments in the aqueous/organic biphasic system. Suitable 2-propanol concentrations in the octyl acetate/water biphasic reaction mixture were examined. Figure 2 shows that the optimum 2-propanol concentration was approximately 6% (v/v) for the total reaction mixture volume. No styrene oxide production was detected in the absence of 2-propanol. However, styrene oxide production decreased above a 2-propanol concentration of 10%. The high concentration of 2-propanol in aqueous solution strips away the water bound to the protein and alters the protein structure. This could explain the optimum 2-propanol concentration. Therefore, an appropriate 2-propanol concentration was required for the effective biotransformation of styrene, although 2-propanol was distributed through the two phases and its effect on the E. coli biocatalyst was complicated."
4,Time course of (S)-styrene oxide production,"2.3 Time course of (S)-styrene oxide production The time course of the accumulation of (S)-styrene oxide, the consumption of styrene in the organic phase, and the 2-propanol concentration in the reaction mixture were determined under the optimized reaction conditions. After 24h, approximately 200mM of styrene was converted into (S)-styrene oxide and the accumulation of the product reached a maximum of 156.4mM (Fig. 3 ). However, 450mM of 2-propanol was consumed after 24h, which was inconsistent with the amount of (S)-styrene oxide produced. The mismatch between the NADH/2-propanol consumption and the epoxide production was probably caused by the formation of H2O2 by the auto-oxidation of free reduced FAD (FADH2) with molecular oxygen. 30–32 A significant decrease in the biocatalytic activity was observed after long reaction times. Rhodococcus sp. ST-10 SMO is inhibited by high concentrations of styrene oxide. 22 Therefore, accumulated styrene oxide likely inhibited the epoxidation activity even in the biphasic reaction system. Park et al. have reported that styrene oxide showed critical toxicity to E. coli cells and decreased the epoxidation activity during feed-batch biphasic biotransformation with recombinant Pseudomonas SMO. 27 Therefore, the reaction must be controlled in order to avoid the inhibitory effect of styrene oxide, and to improve the tolerance of the biocatalyst to the substrate, product, and organic solvent."
5,Synthesis of various chiral epoxides,"2.4 Synthesis of various chiral epoxides The substrate scope and the biocatalyst were evaluated though bioconversion experiments using various alkene substrates (Table 3 ). The E. coli biocatalyst, which contained the Rhodococcus sp. ST-10 SMO and LSADH, showed broad substrate specificity, and a high conversion for the styrene derivatives 1–13, with the exception of 2-bromostyrene 7. Higher conversion yields were obtained for 2- and 4-fluorostyrene 5, 6, and for 4-methylstyrene 10 than for styrene 1. The biocatalyst exhibited excellent enantioselectivity for most substrates (>90%) except for 2-methylstyrene 9, allylbenzene 14, and methyl p-tolylsulfide 18. There was no strong correlation between the conversion rate or the conversion yield and the electron-donating or -withdrawing effects of the substituents in the aromatic ring of the styrene derivatives. The p-halogenated styrenes 4, 6, and 8 showed high initial conversion rates, although the ee of the products were slightly lower. The methyl-substituted styrenes 9 to 12 also showed high initial conversion rates, although a decrease in enantioselectivity was observed for 2-methylstyrene (9) (62.8% ee). These results suggest that the type of substituent and its position in the styrene derivatives affected the conversion rate and enantioselectivity. Moreover, most styrene derivatives only gave epoxide products, whereas indene was also converted into 2-indanone in addition to (1S,2R)-indene oxide. This was probably because indene oxide is unstable and underwent a spontaneous chemical reaction. 33 When vinylpyridines 16 and 17 were used as the substrate, 2-vinylpyridine 16 was efficiently converted into the corresponding epoxide, whereas only a small amount of product was obtained from 4-vinylpyridine 17. Gennaro and co-workers have reported that P. fluorescens ST SMO also has higher productivity for 2-vinylpyridine than for 4-vinylpyridine. 15 They proposed that this is caused by the absence of an electron withdrawing group conjugated to the double bond of the vinyl group. An SMO isolated from a metagenomic library, styrene monooxgenase subunit A (SmoA), catalyzes the sulfoxidation of aromatic sulfides to (R)-sulfoxides with a higher enantioselectivity than the SMO from Pseudomonas putida VLB120, StyA. 11,34 Therefore, we confirmed that the Rhodococcus sp. ST-10 SMO also catalyzed the sulfoxidation of methyl p-tolylsulfide. The Rhodococcus sp. ST-10 SMO showed enantioselectivity (54.5%) similar to that of SmoA (60%) 34 for methyl p-tolyl sulfide, although the product was the (S)-enantiomer, opposite to the enantiomer obtained from SmoA. The enantioselective epoxidation of an aliphatic 1-alkene to (S)-epoxyalkane by SMO has not been previously reported. Hellemond et al. reported that SMOA could not catalyze the epoxidation of linear 1-alkenes, including 1-octene. 34 In contrast, the Rhodococcus sp. ST-5 and ST-10 SMOs can convert 1-hexene and 1-octene into the corresponding (S)-epoxides. 22 We have demonstrated that E. coli biocatalysts can convert these linear alkenes; 1-hexene was converted into (S)-1,2-epoxyhexane with high ee. Our E. coli biocatalyst is a powerful tool for producing various enantiomerically pure (S)-epoxides with 2-propanol as a hydrogen donor in an aqueous/organic biphasic reaction system."
6,Conclusion,"We have successfully constructed an E. coli biocatalyst, which co-expressed the Rhodococcus SMO and LSADH genes, in order to produce enantiomerically pure (S)-epoxides. A biphasic reaction system (octyl acetate/buffer, 1:1) with 2-propanol 6% (v/v) as a hydrogen donor was optimized for the efficient conversion of styrene derivatives. We demonstrated that our biocatalytic system enantioselectively converts various alkenes into their corresponding (S)-epoxides with good yields."

Helium gas was used as the carrier at 15psi and the split ratio was 50. Both the injector and detector temperatures were 250°C and the measurements were performed isothermally with a flame ionization detector. HPLC analysis was performed using a HPLC system (LC-10, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with an OD-H and an OF column (Chiralcel, Daicel Corp., Osaka, Japan) for the analysis of methyl p-tolyl sulfide 18, allylbenzene 14 and their corresponding products. The mobile phase was hexane/2-propanol (49:1) with a flow rate of 1mL/min. The column was kept at 40°C, and the products were monitored at 254nm. The analytical conditions and retention times (r t) of each compound are expressed in Table 4 . GC–mass spectrometry (MS) analysis was performed using a mass spectrometer (QP-5000, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a GC system (GC-17A, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The sample (1μL) was dissolved in ethyl acetate and injected into an HP-1MS capillary column (30m×0.25mm i.d., 0.25μm film; Agilent Technologies, Tokyo, Japan). The carrier gas was He, with a flow rate of 1.7mL/min (14.5psi), the split ratio was 26, and the linear velocity was 47.4cm/s. The 1H NMR spectra were measured on a 400MHz spectrometer (Bruker 400, Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany) in CDCl3. All signals are expressed as ppm with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the reference. Optical rotations were measured with a polarimeter (JASCO P-1030, JASCO, Tokyo, Japan). The absolute configurations of the products were confirmed by comparison of retention times of authentic compounds by GC/HPLC, or with specific rotations reported in the literature."

10,Preparation of biocatalysts,"4.3 Preparation of biocatalysts The genes coding SMO (StyA and StyB) and LSADH were prepared by PCR as previously described. 22,35 The amplified fragments were treated with restriction endonucleases and ligated with compatible pETDuet-1 vector restriction sites (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The constructed plasmid was introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3), which possessed pG-KJE8 (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan), 22 a chaperone carrying plasmid.

When the OD660 reached 0.5, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.1mM in order to induce the expression of the recombinant protein, and the cells were incubated at 18°C for a further 24h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 33,800×g for 10min and stored at −80°C."
11,Biotransformation and purification of epoxides,"4.4 Biotransformation and purification of epoxides The E. coli biocatalysts (wet weight 0.3g) were resuspended in 50mM of potassium phosphate buffer (KPB) (1mL, pH 7.5) containing 1mM of NAD+, and 0.2mM of FAD. The cell suspension (1mL), the 200mM organic solvent solution of the substrate (1mL), and 2-propanol (0.12mL) were transferred into a 50mL tube. The tube was filled with pure oxygen gas and tightly sealed. The reaction was performed with vertical shaking (300rpm) at 25°C for 24h. The reaction mixture was centrifuged, and then the organic phase was recovered and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The amounts of product and substrate were measured by chiral GC or HPLC.
