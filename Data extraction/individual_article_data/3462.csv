0,Introduction,"With more than 50 million metric tons produced annually worldwide [1], hydrogen plays a strategic role in petroleum refining (i. e. hydrocracking, hydrodesulphurisation, hydroisomerization, dearomatisation), in ammonia production and in a range of applications of the electronics industry [2]; moreover, it is also recognized as a clean, efficient and versatile energy vector [3]. Large-scale H2 generation has been so far dominated by fossil fuels: nearly 50% via steam reforming of natural gas, and about 46% from oil/naphtha reforming and coal gasification [4]. Water electrolysis, typically limited to small scale and so far representing only 4% of the world hydrogen production, is now receiving increased attention due to the possibility to use renewable power supply in the logic of a sustainable growth. Renewable energy resources such as photovoltaic and wind have been explored for electrolytic production of hydrogen from water [5]. However, use of solar and wind energy is limited by stability issues caused by intrinsic seasonal and weather-dependent character. Dutton et al. investigated the effects of power fluctuations on alkaline electrolyzers powered by wind turbines: although short-term variations do not have significant effects, intermittent operations protracted over several days resulted in pressure fluctuations with adverse effects on gas purity level [6]. In general, intermittent electrolysis operations may lead to damage and degradation of the separators due to local overload, deactivation of the electrode catalysts, corrosion caused by shortcut currents, gas crossover and pressure equalization between cathode and anode [7]. The capacity factor of intermittent renewable sources usually falls below 40% [8]. Salinity Gradient Power (SGP), the renewable energy extracted from mixing two solutions at different salinity, is recently attracting growing interest among the scientific community. Unexploited estuarial SGP, released when river and seawater mix together, has an estimated global potential of 2000TWhyr−1, which is more than 10% of the current world energy demand [9]. In principle, considering that energy requirement of electrolyzes falls in the range of 53–70kWhkg−1 [10], an efficient utilization of the available SGP would produce up to 38Mtyr−1 of hydrogen. One of the primary technologies capable to exploit SGP is Reverse electrodialysis (RED) [11–20]. A typical scheme of RED unit is illustrated in Fig. 1. Anion exchange membranes (AEM) and cation exchange membranes (CEM) are alternatively stacked between spacers to create adjacent low concentration and high concentration compartments (there after indicated as LCC and HCC, respectively). The chemical potential difference causes the transport of ions through ion exchange membranes from HCC to LCC solutions. Specifically, for NaCl solution, Na+ ions tend to diffuse through CEMs towards the cathode, while Cl- ions diffuse through AEMs in the opposite direction towards the anode; overall, a positive potential is generated on the left side of the stack. Transport of ions through the membranes occurs if an electrical load is connected to the electrodes placed at both sides of the membrane pile: the ionic current in the cells is converted into electron current at the electrodes by redox reactions. The electrical current and the potential difference over the electrodes can be used to generate electrical power [21]. The open circuit voltage (OCV) of the unit is given by the sum of Nernst potential raise over the cell pairs. The potential generated by RED depends on the properties of the membranes, spacer material, geometry, number of cell pairs, operating conditions including salinity gradient level, temperature, flow velocity etc. For ideally permselective ion exchange membranes, the theoretical potential generated by a single cell pair is about .0.076 V for brackish water (0.1M)/seawater (0.5M), 0.13 V for seawater (0.5M)/brine (5M), 0.21 V for brackish water (0.1M)/brine (5M). The thermodynamic threshold for water electrolysis is 1.23V at 25°C [22]. Among the currently available water splitting technologies, alkaline polymer electrolyte (APE) water electrolysis works in alkaline environment using non-precious metal catalysts [23,24]. A scheme of a typical APE water electrolysis unit for hydrogen production consisting of a single cell equipped with a anion selective membrane (ASM) is reported in Fig. 2. When a direct current is applied to the electrodes, electrons flow from the anode to the cathode where hydrogen ions (protons) are reduced to gaseous hydrogen. Driven by the electrical field between the two electrodes, hydroxide ions are transferred through the AEM to the anode, and here are oxidized to O2 returning electrons to the positive terminal. The half reactions occurring at the electrode surfaces of APE water electrolysis are: (1) 2H 2 O + 2e - → 2OH - + H 2 (2) 2OH - → H 2 O + 1 2 O 2 + 2e - resulting in the following overall reaction: (3) H 2 O → 1 2 O 2 + H 2 Few previous attempts in using RED for hydrogen production are reported in literature. In 2006, Seale patented a RED system for simultaneous generation of electricity and electrolytic production of hydrogen [25], followed by a patent of Logan et al. in 2014 [26]. Integration of reverse electrodialysis with microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) in a system called “microbial reverse-electrodialysis electrolysis cell (MREC)” was proposed by Logan et al. with the aim to produce hydrogen from renewable biomass [27–29]. Hatzell et al. investigated the use of thermolytic ammonium bicarbonate solutions for energy capture in a closed-loop RED system using either oxygen reduction or hydrogen evolution [30]. The promotion of H2 evolution directly at the cathode of a RED unit is generally considered unpractical due to requirement of both electrodes with low overpotentials and limited number of cells [31]. On the other hand, the optimization of operative conditions and materials for SGP-RED and APE water electrolysis, individually, might offer the advantage of maximizing both energy generation and hydrogen production. Moreover, the system offers the opportunity of SGP storage in the form of hydrogen. In this work, the potential of an innovative SGP-RED-APE system for hydrogen production driven by SGP as non-fluctuating renewable energy source is implemented and tested. The performance of the RED stack, fed with NaCl solutions at molar concentration of 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 5M (mimicking brackish water, seawater, RO retentate and brine, respectively), acting as power supplier to alkaline water electrolysis unit, is investigated in terms of generated power density and voltage. The APE system is optimized for catalyst and polymer binder loadings and temperature with the aim to get the highest power density at 1.8V."
1,Theoretical background,
2,Reverse electrodialysis,"2.1 Reverse electrodialysis For NaCl solutions, the open circuit voltage of a RED unit generated across CEM and AEM is: (4) O C V = N R T F [ α C E M ln c H C C γ H C C Na + c L C C γ L C C Na + + α A E M ln c H C C γ H C C Cl − c L C C γ L C C Cl − ] where N is the number of cell pairs, R the gas constant (8.314Jmol−1 K−1), T the temperature (K), F the Faraday constant (96,485Cmol−1), α the membrane permselectivity, c the molar concentration (molL−1), and γ the activity coefficient. Subscripts ‘HCC’ and ‘LCC’ stand for High concentration compartment and Low concentration compartment, respectively. The overall performance of RED stack, evaluated in terms of voltage (V), current (I) and gross power density (P d ), is limited by the total internal resistance of the stack (R stack ). According to Ohm’s law, the voltage drop is linearly related to the current as: (5.1) V = O C V - R s t a c k · I R stack is given by the sum of the total cell pairs resistance (R cells ) and the active resistance of the electrode compartments, also known as blank resistance (R blank ): (5.2) R s t a c k = R c e l l s + R b l a n k In order to extrapolate the measured value of power density to the case of a stack where the effect of blank resistance is negligible (for a high number of cell pairs), we estimate a “corrected” stack voltage V corr by subtracting the voltage drop due to the cell pairs resistance from the OCV: (5.3) V c o r r = O C V − R c e l l s I c o r r where the “corrected” current Icorr is defined as (5.4) I c o r r = V c o r r R u and Ru is the external load. The electric power density P d , plotted versus the current density i (Wm−2), exhibits a typical parabolic trend described by a second order equation: (6.1) P d = 1 N A V 2 R u = 1 N A ( O C V R s t a c k + R u ) 2 R u = − a ⋅ i 2 + b ⋅ i where A is the active area of a single membrane, a and b are two fitting parameters. According to Eq. (6.1), P d reaches its maximum value P d, max =b2/4a for a maximum current density i max = b/2. A “corrected” power density P d, corr is calculated by combining Eqs. (5.3)–(5.4) with Eq. (6.1): (6.2) P d , c o r r = 1 N A V c o r r 2 R u = 1 N A ( O C V R c e l l s + R u ) 2 R u"
3,Alkaline water electrolysis,"2.2 Alkaline water electrolysis From a thermodynamic point of view, the variation in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the electrochemical reaction is expressed by: (7) Δ G = − n F Δ E ° where ΔE° is the equilibrium cell voltage and n is the number of electrons involved in the redox reaction. At standard ambient conditions (25°C and 1atm), a ΔG = 237.2kJmol−1 is theoretically required to initiate the water electrolysis reaction, corresponding to a reversible cell potential of 1.23V. Due to inherently slow electrode kinetics, an overpotential above the equilibrium cell voltage is required to overcome the activation barrier of the electrochemical reactions. In addition, transport-related resistances due to the ionic transfer in the electrolyte and membrane, and to gas bubbles covering the electrode surfaces, call for an extra-energy input that causes a potential drop through the cell. As a consequence, in industrial practice, the cell potential ΔEcell is always 1.8–2.0V at the current density of 1–3kAm−2 [32]. The power consumed by the electrolyser (P e) is given by: (8) P e = Δ E c e l l I e where Ie is the current flowing through the system. According to the Faraday's laws, the hydrogen production rate (HPR) (molh−1) is theoretically estimated by: (9) H P R = 3600 ⋅ I e z F η where z represents the equivalent electrons per mole of hydrogen, η is conversion efficiency factor set at 80% [30,33] and 3600 is a conversion constant (seconds per hour)."
4,Materials and methods,
5,Reverse electrodialysis,"3.1 Reverse electrodialysis The electrolyte solution, consisting of 0.3M K4Fe(CN)6, 0.3M K3Fe(CN)6 and 2.5M NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Italy), was prepared by dissolving reagents in deionised water (PURELAB, Elga LabWater®, 0.055μScm−1), and re-circulated at a flow rate of 20Lh−1 between the anodic and cathodic compartments to sustain the redox reaction. Feed solutions were prepared by using analytical reagent grade NaCl (Carlo Erba, Italy) dissolved in deionised water, and recirculated at flow velocity of 0.7cms−1 using a Masteflex L/S digital peristaltic pums (Cole-Palmer, US). The conductivity of saline solutions was measured by YSI (US) model 3200 Conductivity Instrument. A cross flow RED stack (REDstack B.V., The Netherlands), equipped with AEM-80045 and CEM-80050 ion exchange membranes (Fujifilm Manufacturing Europe B. V, The Netherlands) with active area of 10×10cm2, was operated in cross-flow configuration ( Fig. 3a). Main properties of ion exchange membranes are reported in Table 1 Spacers made in PET (Deukum GMBH, Germany) with thickness of 270µm, were placed between membranes to create compartments. Standard power density tests were carried out with 25 membrane pairs. The electrode compartments are composed of 10×10cm2 inert Ti-Ru/Ir mesh (MAGNETO Special Anodes B. V., The Netherlands). Flow temperatures were stabilized at 25°C by using a Digital Plus RTE201 thermostatic bath (Neslab, US); SPER SCIENTIFIC 800012 multi-channel Pt100 resistance thermometer with sensitivity ±0.1°C and pressure gauges RF-D201 (DUNGS®, Germany) were used to monitor temperatures and pressures. A resistance box (high dissipation five decade) in the range of 0.1–1000Ω (CROPICO, Bracken Hill, US) was used to load the SGP-RE unit. The resulting DC voltage drop across the resistors and current were measured by Agilent 34422A 6½ Digit Multimeter. In order to measure the power really consumed by the electrolyte and LCC/HCC multichannel recirculation peristaltic pump, a Hioki 3333 POWER HiTESTER (Japan) was used."
6,Alkaline water electrolysis,"3.2 Alkaline water electrolysis A single cell APE water electrolysis unit (Fig. 3b) was used in electrolytic tests for hydrogen production driven by RED stack. The two side blocks of the cell were made of steel terminal plates and polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) inner plates sealed by expanded Teflon (GORE GR 05, W. L. Gore & Associates Inc.). Sheets of anodic and cathodic materials based on 1.7mm thick porous Ni foam (INCO Advanced Technology Materials Co, Ltd.) with active area of 2×2cm2 and pore diameter of 0.58mm were used as a electrode. Gold plated nickel was used as current feeder/electrolyte (10% w/w potassium hydroxide, KOH) distributor. The electrolyte was fed to the APE water electrolysis unit at flow velocity of 1.6cms−1. Experiments were performed in the temperature range of 25–65°C. Highly active spinel family metal oxides based on Ni served as catalysts. NiCo2O4 and NiFe2O4 (prepared by co-precipitation method as detailed in [35]) were used for coating anode and cathode, respectively. Catalyst-binder ink was prepared by mixing different amounts of catalyst material and polymer binder solutions (consisting of a 60% w/w suspension of polytetrafluoroethylene, PTFE) in equal portions with deionised water and isopropyl alcohol. After sufficient homogenization of catalyst-binder ink in an ultrasonic bath, catalyst coated electrodes (CC-GDL) were prepared by spraying the catalyst-binder ink on the nickel foam placed on the hot plate at 120°C to ensure quick evaporation of the solvents and forming catalytic layer. In all experiments, the NiCo2O4 load in the anode was the same as that of the NiFe2O4 load in the cathode; loads were varied in the range of 5–15mgcm−2. The CC-GDL was then heated at 325°C for 15min to bind the catalyst to the Ni foam. Composition of the prepared catalytic layers varied from 75% w/w of catalyst+25% w/w of PTFE to 95% w/w of catalyst+5% w/w of PTFE. The AEM, specifically tailored for high ionic-conductivity, was composed of low-density polyethylene (ExxonMobil TM, LD 605BA) and a water-soluble component of poly (ethylene glycol-ran-propylene glycol) (PEG–PPG) (Sigma-Aldrich) blended with anion selective resins made of styrene-divinyl benzene copolymer matrix with quaternary ammonium functional groups (MEGA Co., Czech Republic). The detailed preparation and activation protocol of the membrane is described elsewhere [36]. Relevant properties of the AEM are presented Table 2. A voltage of 1.5–2V was applied to the electrolysis unit by DC power source Statron 3251.1 (Statron Gerätetechnik GmbH, Germany) in order to evaluate the dependence of the current on input voltage (load curve). In order to determine resistances of the membrane and solution (Rm+s), anode (Ra) and cathode (Rc), Solartron SI 1287 Electrochemical Interface was used to input perturbation signal in the frequency range of 65kHz–10Hz and amplitude of 20mV at 1.8V, and Solartron SI 1250 Frequency Response Analyzer to investigate the changes in the input signal after passing through the system. Experiments were carried out at the corresponding conditions of the alkaline water electrolysis. Fig. 4 shows equivalent circuit used for fitting the data from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Reverse electrodialysis,"4.1 Reverse electrodialysis Fig. 5 shows the polarization curves of the SGP-RED unit at different LCC and HCC concentration. The diagram confirms the linear relationship between current and voltage according to Eq. (5.1). When feeding the SGP-RED stack with 0.1M NaCl//5M NaCl solutions at flow velocity of 0.7cms−1 and room temperature, the highest OCV (3.4V) was measured; at zero voltage, a shortcut current (I shortcut) of 0.89A was determined. Under these conditions, the internal areal resistance (IAR), evaluated from the slope of the V vs I straight-line, was 15.3Ωcm2 per cell. When reducing the HCC concentration to 1M NaCl, the OCV decreased by 38% down to 2.1V, while I shortcut remarkably reduced by 60%. The observed enhancement of IAR to 23.5Ωcm2 per cell is coherent with previous investigations [16]. When shifting from 5M NaCl to 1M NaCl, the consequential reduction of HCC solution conductivity (from 248mScm−1 to 86mScm−1) does not affect significantly the stack resistance. Computing the HCC compartment areal resistance for a spacer thickness of 270µm and a obstruction factor of 1.212 [37], the observed increase of the areal resistance from 0.13 to 0.38Ωcm2 per cell accounts for less than 2% of IAR. On the other side, the smaller ionic flux resulting from a reduced salinity gradient slows down the exchange of ions between the compartments, leading to a lower average conductivity in the LCC compartment. This contribute to the total resistance by one order of magnitude more than the HCC salinity. For a LCC feed concentration of 0.1M NaCl (conductivity: 9.8mS/cm), the activity gradient (γHCCcHCC-γLCCcLCC) reduces by 87% when decreasing HCC solution concentration from 5M to 1M (activity coefficients are from [38]). Increasing LCC concentration has a negative impact on the RED performance [17]. The combination 0.5M NaCl//5M NaCl resulted in a 45% decrease of OCV (1.9V) with respect to the case 0.1M NaCl//5M NaCl. Although less relevant, it is worth mentioning the consequent 20% reduction of the stack resistance. The measured OCV for 0.1MNaCl//1M NaCl is slightly larger (∼10%) than for 0.5M NaCl//5M NaCl, and the apparent permselectivity (calculated as actual OCV divided by the theoretical one predicted by Eq. (4) when assuming α=1) is 84% and 57%, respectively. As expected, the membrane permselectivity decreased when the salt content increased as a result of a weakened Donnan exclusion of co-ions [39], so playing a controlling role of RED performance at high solution concentration. The lowest OCV (0.71V) and I shortcut (0.17A) were measured in correspondence of the lowest feed salinity ratio (0.5M NaCl//1M NaCl). Although the above results indicate the possibility to increase the SGP-RED performance by working at high HCC and low LCC concentration, some operative limitations exist: NaCl concentration around 5M negatively affects the membrane permselectivity (the apparent permselectivity calculated for the combinations 0.1M NaCl//5M NaCl and 0.5M NaCl//5M NaCl is 65 and 57%, respectively), while LCC concentration below 0.1M enhances the Ohmic losses [40,41]. Gross power density (per membrane pair, MP) curves resulting from RED unit operated at different LCC and HCC concentrations are illustrated in Fig. 6a. The highest P d, max (3.0Wm−2 MP) was obtained when working with 0.1M NaCl//5M NaCl solutions; the maximum of the parabolic curve was attained for a current density i max of 45Am−2. However, a significant reduction (−63%) was observed for a 5-fold increase of the LCC concentration (0.5M NaCl), resulting in a P d,max of 1.1Wm−2 MP; under the same condition, i max decreased by 33%. Experimental tests carried out with 0.1M NaCl//1M NaCl resulted in a P d,max of 0.77Wm−2 MP and in a i max of 17.9Am−2. Mixing 0.5M NaCl (mimicking seawater salinity) and 1M NaCl (mimicking brine from RO operated at 50% recovery factor) led to impractically low values of P d,max around 0.1Wm−2 MP. Fig. 6b compares the experimentally measured maximum power density with the corrected values extrapolated for the case of a stack where the effect of blank resistance is negligible. Rblank, estimated as the intercept of the regression line of measured Rstack at different number of cell pairs (10, 15, 20 and 25), resulted in a value of 0.5Ω. For the different LCC:HCC combinations, the corrected maximum power density (according to Eq. (6.2)) was about 20–25% higher than the one experimentally determined. Early investigations by Audinos et al. attained a maximum power density of 400mW/m2 when mixing river water and brine [42]. More recently, Veerman et al. reported a maximum power density of 0.93Wm−2 for a RED operated with artificial seawater and river water [43]. The maximum power density reported so far for mixing seawater and river water is about 2.2Wm−2 [41]: this work uses commercial Fuma-Tech membranes and benefits from very thin spacers. The first tailor-made membranes designed specifically for RED achieved a highest power density of about 2.6Wm−2 MP [44,45]. A power density of 6.7Wm−2 was achieved by Daniilidis et al. with 0.01M NaCl//5M NaCl at 60°C [40]. Tedesco et al. claimed a Pd of 12Wm−2 MP, the highest value so far reported in literature, when using 0.1M NaCl as diluate and 5M NaCl as concentrate at 40°C [17]. When using artificial feed solutions (brackish water and saturated brine corresponding to ≈0.03M and 4–5M NaClequivalent, respectively), power densities up to 2.7Wm−2 MP have been reported from experiments on a pilot-scale RED plant (125 cell pairs, 44×44cm2) located in Sicily [46]. Keeping constant the salinity ratio to 10, the better performance detected when working with more concentrated solutions (0.5M NaCl//5M NaCl instead of 0.1M NaCl//1M NaCl) is due to the reduction of Ohmic losses as a consequence of the increased conductivity of the solutions. Changes in LCC and HCC concentration had a moderate impact on the fitting parameter a (Eq. (6.1)), which is related to stack resistance, showing values from 0.0013 (0.5M NaCl//5M NaCl) to 0.0024 (0.1M NaCl//1M NaCl). Parameter b, which is related to the electromotive force over the membranes is sensitive to the salinity gradient and varied from 0.029 (0.5M NaCl//1M NaCl) to 0.13 (0.1M NaCl//5M NaCl) [15]. Fluid recirculation across the stack requires a given amount of pumping energy that increases with flow velocity; therefore, the net amount of power density is sensitive to the energy loss in the SGP-RE system due to pressure drop [15,47]. Referring to the operative conditions resulting in the generation of the highest gross power density (0.1M NaCl//5M NaCl and flowrate of 0.7cms−1), pressure drops detected in low (ΔpLCC) and high concentration compartments (ΔpHCC) were 0.06 and 0.14bar, respectively. As a result, the theoretical value of net power density represents about the 80% of the gross power density."
9,APE water electrolysis tests,"4.2 APE water electrolysis tests 4.2.1 Effect of catalyst loading The electrode activity depends on many parameters, including the loading level of the catalytic material. In the present study, experimental investigations were carried out in the range of 5–15mgcm−2 (keeping constant the binder loading at 15% w/w) and at working temperature of 65°C; the corresponding electrolysis load curves are shown in Fig. 7. Current density enhanced by 12% (from 107mAcm−2 to 120mA/cm2) at 1.8V when the catalyst loading was increased from 5mgcm−2 to 10mgcm−2. The better performance is due to the increase of contact area available to electrochemical reaction, leading to a higher hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) rate. The enhancement in process efficiency was more noticeable at higher voltage: current density increased by 24% at 2 V. However, further increase of the catalyst load from 10 to 15mgcm−2 at 1.8V resulted in a performance loss, and current density reduced by 26% (from 120mAcm−2 to 89mAcm−2). This is probably due to the decrease of the electron contact for the catalyst particle. It represents one of the three essential demands on the composition of the catalytic layer in order to achieve optimal three phase contact in the catalytic layer, i.e. catalytic particle has to be in contact with reagent, electrons and ions. Evidence for an optimal catalyst loading is reported in literature. Ma et al. tested different MEA based on supported Iridium/titanium carbide electrocatalysts prepared at different Ir catalyst loading for polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolysis [48]. A remarkable improvement of the cell performance (current density increased by about 20% at 1.8V) was detected when Ir loading in the anode varied from 1.0mgcm−2 to 2.5mgcm−2 due to the enlarged electrochemically active area. On the other hand, for higher catalyst loading, the performance gain was almost completely lost as a consequence of the increase in Ohmic resistance attributed to a thicker catalyst layer. 4.2.2 Effect of binder loading In MEA, a polymer binder is required in order to attach a catalytic layer to a gas-diffusion layer, so creating a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) [46–52]. GDE improves the stability of the catalyst by counteracting its rapid loss. Additionally, in case of massive gas bubbling at the electrode, the appropriate choice of binder loading improves the adhesion of the catalyst layer. In the present work, PTFE was used as a polymeric binder ensuring adequate mechanical stability to the GDE. Table 3 summarizes the experimental results obtained from tests on the alkaline electrolyser operated at 10mgcm−2 catalyst loading. Data indicate that the best performance was achieved for a binder loading of 15% w/w, and a current density of 120mAcm−2 at 1.8V was measured at temperature of 65°C and electrolyte flow rate of 5mLmin−1. It was also observed that the current density declined by 55% when the binder loading was reduced to 5% w/w: a low content of polymeric binder in the catalyst layer reduces the utilization surface at the gas/electrolyte/electrode interface, thus resulting in a lower current density at the same potential. On the other hand, when the binder loading was increased to 25% w/w, the current density decreased by 52%: an excessive binder content results in catalyst area coverage that avoids an efficient electron exchange and leads to an increase of electrode resistance. Moreover, high loading levels of polymeric binders reduce gas permeability of GDE. Song et al. investigated the effect of Nafion® content in the Pt black catalyst of a PEM fuel cell electrode: a binder loading greater than 35% w/w in the cathode led to a significant loss of performance even with a little further increase in Nafion® content due to blockage of the catalyst sites and a reduction of gas permeability in the catalytic layer, while an opposite trend was detected when increasing the binder content from 15% to 35% w/w [52]. Temperature enhances the electrochemical reaction rate and reduces the electrode overpotential, thereby improving the cell performance. As reported in Table 3, for a 15% w/w binder loading, the current density increased by +128% when the temperature shifted from 25°C to 45°C; further increase of the temperature from 45°C to 65°C resulted in a 110% increase of current density; at the average, the increase of current density was 2.3mAcm−2 °C−1. Santarelli et al. investigated the influence of temperature on a high-pressure PEM electrolyser for hydrogen production; they observed an improvement of current density by about 20% when increasing the temperature from 42 to 58°C at cell voltage higher than 1.8V and pressure of 7bar [53]. For HER on pure nickel electrodes operated at 2.5atm, a decrease of 115mV for a current density of 100mAcm−2 was observed when the temperature increased from 70 to 150°C [54]. 4.2.3 Cell resistance Table 4 shows the results from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements for the resistance of single components in the electrolytic cell, on the bases of the equivalent electrical circuit shown in Fig. 8. The in situ measurements displayed a slightly decreasing Ohmic resistance of the heterogeneous AEM and electrolyte solution (Rm+s) within the range of 0.22–0.19Ω for a temperature interval of 25–65°C, due to a progressive increase of ion mobility. A similar decreasing trend of AEM resistance with temperature was reported by Fontananova et al. [34]. In the investigated range of temperature, while there was no significant variation of the polarization resistance of the cathode (R c ), the anode resistance (R a ) fell down by 50% when heating the system from 25°C to 65°C. In general, the higher polarization resistance of the anode with respect to the cathode is due to the fact that oxygen evolution reaction is significantly slower and has got more energy than HER [23]."
10,Hydrogen production rate,"4.3 Hydrogen production rate Fig. 8 shows the effect of the main operating parameters on the performance of the water electrolysis unit. The HPR, normalized per electrode surface area (4cm2), was sensitive to changes in the temperature: it increased by 0.9cm3 cm−2 h−1 per°C, reaching a maximum value of 44cm3 cm−2 h−1, corresponding to 1.8·10−3 molH2 cm−2 h−1. The positive impact of increasing temperature is explained in terms of reduction of the electrode overpotential and enhancement of solution conductivity [23,54]. The highest HPR was achieved for an optimal binder loading of 15% w/w, decreasing by 50–60% when the binder loading was either reduced to 5% w/w or increased to 25% w/w. The impact of catalyst loading was less relevant: the HPR variation margin was below 20% when changing catalyst loading by ±50% higher or lower with respect to its optimal level (10mgcm−2). Luo et al. tested a microbial reverse-electrodialysis electrolysis cells (MRECs) using ammonium bicarbonate as thermolytic solution [55]. The 7-cell pairs membrane stack configuration (cathode projected area: 7cm2, effective area of each membrane: 8cm2, electrode chamber volume: 30mL each allowed a maximum volumetric hydrogen production rate of ~ 1.5m3 H2 m−3d−1 (expressed per volume of anolyte), corresponding to 1.1·10−5 molH2 cm−2 h−1. Hatzell et al. investigated the production of hydrogen and generation of electrical power in a closed-loop ammonium bicarbonate reverse electrodialysis systems with 20 cell pairs and total active membrane area of 0.87m2, projected electrode area of 207cm2, Ti Pt/Ir anode, two different cathodes for hydrogen evolution reaction or oxygen reduction reaction, operated at low concentrate solution flowrate of 400mLmin−1 [25]. In the case of direct hydrogen and electricity generation, the maximum energy extracted as hydrogen gas at the limiting current point was ~10.6Whm−3 (95% of the total generated energy, including electrode overpotentials) corresponding to 1.6·10−5 molH2 cm−2 h−1, that is significantly lower than HPR observed in the present APE water electrolysis unit. If a HER based RED was operated at the peak power position, 4.75Whm−3 were obtained from hydrogen (~50% of the total generated energy, including electrode overpotentials) corresponding to 7.1·10−6 molH2 cm−2 h−1. The experimental activity allowed at identifying the best operational conditions for APE water electrolysis cell at catalyst loading of 10mgcm−2, polymer binder of 15% w/w and temperature of 65°C. Driving the system at 1.8V, the polarization curve in Fig. 7 indicates a current density of 120mAcm−2, corresponding to a current of 0.48A considering geometrical electrode surface area of 4cm2. The intersection point (0.48A, 1.8V) of polarization curves for the SGP-RED unit and the APE water electrolysis cell, corresponds to a power of 0.86W, is illustrated in Fig. 9. A “process efficiency” can be defined as the ratio of H2 generation rate (moles of H2 per m2 of electrode surface area per second) on the electric current density (expressed as flux of charges in moles of electrons per m2 of electrode surface area per second, normalized by the number z of electrons required for the generation of a molecule of H2). As a check of consistency of results, the highest H2 generation rate of 5.0·10−3 molH2 m−2 s−1 obtained in this work for a current density of 1200A/m2 (F=96,485Cmol−1, z=2) results in a process efficiency of 80%. In order to achieve this target, the number of cell pairs in the SGP-RED stack was slightly increased to 27, giving a OCV of 3.7V that is generated when working with 0.1M NaCl//5M NaCl at room temperature and 0.7cms−1. At laboratory scale, the measured power really consumed by the multichannel peristaltic pump used to recirculate electrolyte and HCC/LCC solutions was 23W, overall resulting in a negative net power density generated by the SGP-RED unit. At large scale, efforts in testing and improving the reliability of renewable energy production from salinity gradient are ongoing: experimental activity on the first large-scale RED pilot plant (equipped with almost 50m2 of IEMs), installed in the South of Italy in the framework of the REAPower project, demonstrated the possibility to reach a net power output of 30–40W when using artificial NaCl solutions [56]. In perspective, the integration of RED into pre-existing industrial plants (e. g. RO membrane desalination) might reduce or eliminate the energy input required to recirculate diluate and concentrate streams. Concerning the APE water electrolysis unit, the power consumed by the pump recirculating the electrolyte was 5.5W."
11,Conclusions,"This work proves the viability of Salinity Gradient Power as renewable and non-intermittent energy source for indirect production of hydrogen. The integration, at lab-scale, of a reverse electrodialysis (SGP-RED) unit fed with different NaCl solutions mimicking highly concentrated brine (5M), RO concentrate (1M), seawater (0.5M) and brackish water (0.1M) - with an alkaline polymer electrolyte (APE) water electrolysis cell, resulted in a maximum hydrogen production rate of 44cm3 h−1 cm−2 of electrode surface area (optimal conditions: LCC 0.1M NaCl//HCC 5M NaCl, 15% w/w polymer binder loading, 10mgcm−2 catalyst loading, 65°C). At salinity ratio of 50, the maximum gross power density achieved by the SGP-RED unit equipped with 25 cell-pairs was about 3Wm−2 MP. The use of brine (from solar ponds or membrane distillation [15]) has the interesting potential to mitigate the impact of desalination industry on the environment; in addition, hydrogen is today recognized as an intrinsically eco-friendly energy vector assuring zero-CO2 emission. A successful scale-up of SGP-RED to industrial level strongly depends on the availability of ion exchange membranes exhibiting low electrical resistance, high permselectivity and stability under real conditions. Specifically, the influence of multivalent ions (mostly Mg2+ and SO 4 2 - ) present in natural water sources, as well as the impact of fouling on long-term performance, need to be deeply investigated. Concerning APE water electrolysis, further research efforts need to be addressed on the development of better performing electrodes, use of more stable and active electrocatalysts, synthesis and fabrication of highly conductive polymer electrolyte membranes exhibiting good chemical and mechanical stability in corrosive OH− environment [24,32,57,58]."
