0,Introduction,"Mixed microbial cultures-based production of chemicals is gaining attention as alternative against climate change and dependence on fossil fuels. However, products generation efficiency remains challenging (Villano et al., 2017). Bio-electrochemical systems (BES) has been proved as feasible technology to obtain a wide assortment of value-added products by taking advantage of the several redox reactions involved in anaerobic digestion of organic substrates just before methane production is achieved (Nevin et al., 2010). Suppressing methanogenesis is considered a novel issue in the field of BES since methanogens compete for substrate and against electrogenic activity for higher energy-containing products generation like hydrogen (Microbial Electrolysis Cell, MEC), electricity (Microbial Fuel Cell, MFC) or bio-alcohols (Microbial Electrosynthesis, MES) (Bajracharya et al., 2016; Chae et al., 2010; Santoro et al., 2017). Bio-alcohols production by MES is related to acidifying microorganisms and hydrogen producing bacterial activity (i.e., Clostridium sp.) which could switch from the hydrogen and acid-producing phase to the alcohol-producing phase due to its capability of biphasic fermentation under autotrophic conditions using VFAs as electron acceptors (Kondaveeti and Min, 2015; Min et al., 2013; Sharma et al., 2013a). In addition, these microorganisms also have the capability of uptake electrons from a solid cathode electrode in their metabolism “electrothrops” and can release more reduced products than the original substrate after several metabolic transformations (Giddings et al., 2015; Santoro et al., 2017). Consequently, this fermentation process accomplishes with the assistance of small amounts of external voltage (commonly 0.6–1.0 V) applied through electrodes (Rabaey and Rozendal, 2010). The additional voltage drives electrons from an anode electrode to a cathode electrode, where bio-alcohols producing mixed cultures are found attached as biofilms (Pant et al., 2012). In particular, direct electrons supply to the cultures influence metabolic pathways by affecting the intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) balance (Villano et al., 2017). The conversion of NAD from its oxidized form (NAD+) to its reduced form (NADH) provides the cells with a mechanism for accepting electrons coming from the cathode and hence modifying the oxidation reduction potential (ORP) of the reaction medium towards more favorable conditions for reduced products generation (Rosenbaum et al., 2011). These mechanisms have been proposed as an effective way to overcome common thermodynamic limitations associated to reductive reactions found in traditional fermentation process. Besides, recent studies using MES, have reported improvement in hydrogen, solvent and alcohol production at higher efficiency rates compared to conventional fermentation methods (Pant et al., 2012). Therefore, microbial reduction of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) into bio-alcohols is so far the preferred application of MES since acetic acid and butyric acids can be easily produced from renewable and waste materials (Mamimin et al., 2017). However, extracting bio-alcohols impose several drawbacks to the system since they are intermediate products in methane generation process and are mean to be consumed by methanogens in the late phase of anaerobic digestion (methanogenesis); thus, remaining in the solution for short periods of time with small recoverable amounts (Schievano et al., 2016). Suppression of methane-producing microorganisms would be an advantage for bio-alcohols recovery (Kaur et al., 2014). Methane production control techniques have been extensively studied in the field of dark fermentation by mixed cultures (Steinbusch et al., 2009a, 2009b). However only few research has been conducted on methanogens inhibition in MES operation (Chae et al., 2010; Rajesh et al., 2014, 2018a; Tiwari and Ghangrekar, 2015). In an MES operation, bacteria and archaea can compete for the available substrate with production of bio-alcohols and methane, respectively. The higher cathode potentials through applied voltage can enhance the bacteria reaction kinetics and increase their metabolism to consume more substrate and leave less available substrate for the methanogens, which result in lower methane production rate (Sleutels, 2010). However, it has been also shown that increased cathode potentials enhanced methane production in MES (Lee et al., 2018) suggesting that external power supply alone cannot suppress methanogenic activity (Agler et al., 2011). Addition of chemicals like 2-bromoethanesulfonate or methyl viologen (MV) as methanogens inhibitor has been tested successfully, but it is desirable that nontoxic compounds are utilized and less expensive techniques are applied (Kaur et al., 2014; Kondaveeti and Min, 2015; Steinbusch et al., 2009a, 2009b). Literature reports feasible methods to inhibit methanogens under traditional fermentation process without adversely affecting bio-alcohols producer microorganisms, including pH control of the reductive medium in the range of 5–6 and heat shock applied to the inoculum source (Chae et al., 2010; Steinbusch et al., 2009a, 2009b). However, methanogens activity tends to stabilize pH to neutral values which can be detrimental for bio-alcohols production (Qiao et al., 2015). It has been proposed a way to overcome this issue by maintaining an acidic environment; thus, the proton electrochemical gradient across the cytoplasmic layer of microorganisms can redirect the overall production and consumption of protons to bio-alcohols generation (Jadhav et al., 2018). Additionally, it has been found that bacteria are predominant microbes over archaea under acidic conditions in a continuous anaerobic digestion reactor of waste activated sludge, where pH 5.0 suppressed the community towards dominance of bacteroidetes including acidogens which could not convert organics into methane (Latif et al., 2017). Biological reduction of acetic and butyric acids into bio-alcohols belongs to the alcohol-producing phase which has been hypothesized to be induced physiologically by low pH (Min et al., 2013). Maintenance of acidic conditions was stablished as key factor for the stability of the system in the present study (Jadhav et al., 2018; Steinbusch et al., 2008; Wang and Yin, 2017). Mentioned technique is considered environmentally and cost friendly without generation of harmful byproducts. However, their effectiveness has not been deeply assessed under MES conditions yet. The present research investigated the effect of continuous pH control of the inoculum for the inhibition of methanogenesis on bio-alcohols production improvement in single chamber MES reactors under various concentrations of VFAs (2.0, 6.0 and 8.0 g-COD/l). Furthermore, dynamics of mixed cultures were assessed by measuring soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) variations, VFAs consumption, pH variation and methane production. The obtained results are aimed to contribute towards the development of bio-based and sustainable bio-fuels production."
1,Materials and methods,
2,MES reactors configuration and operation,"2.1 MES reactors configuration and operation Single chamber MES reactors were fabricated using perplex glass having a volume of 360 ml (Fig. S1a). Carbon brushes (2.5 × 5 cm) were used as anode and cathode electrodes after pretreatment, as described in previous literature (Feng et al., 2010). Anode and cathode electrodes were connected to a DC power supply through a Potentiostat (Array 3645A; 0-36V/0-3A; circuit specialists Ln., USA) adjusted at 0.8 V with the negative lead connected to the cathode electrode with an external resistance of 10 Ω, while the positive lead of the circuit was connected directly to the anode, following the design of previous studies (Kondaveeti and Min, 2015). MESs were operated in fed-batch mode having different VFA concentrations equivalent to the sCOD value of 2.0, 6.0, and 8.0 g/l. The feed solution consisted of a mixture of 125 ml ADS and 125 ml of growth medium solution (GM). The growth medium recipe was as follows: 1) vitamin solution 5.0 ml/l; 2) mineral solution 12.5 ml/l, 0.62 g/l of NH4CL and 0.26 g/l of KCL. Vitamin and mineral solutions were prepared as described in previous studies (Kondaveeti and Min, 2015; Li et al., 2016). Acetic (AC) and butyric (BC) acids were used as the sole carbon source for the microorganisms as detailed in Table S1. The MESs were inoculated with anaerobic digestion up flow effluent sludge (ADS) collected from Yongin Respia wastewater treatment plant (Yongin-si Korea) (Lee et al., 2018) and operated under strict anaerobic conditions (N2-purging) in an incubator, maintain a temperature of 30 °C. More details in operation MESs during experiment period is given in the Supplementary text. Methanogens control technique consisted of pH adjustment and was carried out by adding small amounts (approx. 200 μl) of 2 M HCL each 2 days, thus pH of solution remained constant around 5. Prior supplementation and sealing of the reactors, headspace and solutions were purged with nitrogen gas for 15–20 min, to ensure strict anaerobic conditions and minimize the effect of dissolved oxygen. Feed solution pH was regulated to 5.0 with either 2 M NaOH or 2 M HCL to avoid acids ionization and promote alcohols production (Min et al., 2013). Finally, gas bags were placed for gas collection and reactors were incubated at 30 °C in a stirrer (180 rpm) to avoid mass transfer limitations (Ganigué et al., 2015; Schievano et al., 2016). Each batch started again when a decrease in cell voltage was noticed. For this process, the solutions were replaced in the exactly as described earlier. Additionally, three extra control reactors were operated under 2.0, 6.0 and 8.0 g-COD/l of VFAs concentration with the same operational conditions excepting that methane production control technique was not applied. Reactors were operated during three consecutive cycles of ten days each one after adaptation period which consisted of two additional cycles until constant current generation was achieved."
3,Analysis and calculation,"2.2 Analysis and calculation Voltage and current (I = P/V) were measured across an external resistor of 10 Ω with a 5 min interval using data acquisition system in a personal computer as described in a previous report (Min et al., 2005). Liquid samples of 5 ml were collected (0, 3, 5 and 10 days operation) for alcohols, VFAs pH and sCOD measurements using a sterile and nitrogen purged syringes. Bio-alcohols were detected by gas chromatography (GC; Agilent USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and fitted with a HP innowax column (Agilent, USA). The injector, oven and detector temperature were 150, 220 and 230 °C respectively. Helium was used as a carrier gas with a flow rate of 5 ml/min (Kondaveeti and Min, 2015). Samples preparation for alcohols analysis were made by Liquid-Liquid Extraction (LLE) technique, using ethyl ether as organic solvent (Adorno et al., 2014). VFAs concentrations were measured by ion chromatography (IC-861, Metrohm, USA chromatogram) equipped with an organic acids column (61,005.200 organic acids 290/7.8). Samples for VFAs analysis were filtered using an acrodisc (0.2 μm) syringe filter and analyzed directly. pH and COD values were measured under standard methods (APHA, 2005). Gas samples were taken from gas bags using gas syringe (Hamilton, USA) to analyze gas composition which was carried out using gas chromatogram (GC) equipped with TCD (Thermal conductivity detector) and carboxen column (Supelco, USA). The oven, detector, and injector were maintained at 150, 150 and 200 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas with a flow rate of 6 ml/min. All analytical systems were calibrated with standard chemicals in a range of sample concentrations."
4,Alcohol yield calculation,"2.3 Alcohol yield calculation The efficiency of bio-alcohols production was assessed through alcohol yield calculations which is defined as the share of the consumed substrate (acetate and butyrate) that is converted into total alcohols. It is calculated from Eqs. (1) and (2). (1) ΔVFA = VFA i − VFA f (2) A = Δ P ΔVFA where ΔVFA is the total consumed VFAs expressed as g-CODVFAs (VFA i is the initial substrate concentration, VFA f is the final substrate concentration). ΔP Represents the total production of alcohols in (g-CODAlcohols) regardless chemical composition and A is the alcohol yield in g-CODAlcohols/g-CODVFAs."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Bio-electrochemical performance of MES under different organic loading rates,"3.1 Bio-electrochemical performance of MES under different organic loading rates All the MESs having pH adjusted inoculum irrespective of initial VFA loading could reach at a stable current generation state after 2.5 days of operational period. The current generation was noticed to be increased with operation days and reached at its maximum around 3–5 days of operation and then decreased as the substrate availability decreased in the respective MES (Fig. 1 ). This behavior of current generation profile in batch mode of operation is usual for BES (Barbosa et al., 2017; Noori et al., 2016). More importantly, the current consumption profile under an applied potential of ~0.8 V suggests that bio-alcohol producing microorganisms are electron consumers and might have an important role in the stabilization of the electrochemical reduction process (Kracke et al., 2018). During stable current generation, the MES with 2.0 g-COD/l could recover a maximum current value of 5.32 mA, which was noted significantly higher as compared to the MES operated under 6.0 (3.6 mA) and 8.0 g-COD/l (0.44 mA) substrate concentration. The cathode potential profile also followed the same trend and the highest value of average cathode potential of 0.87 V was recorded for the MES operated with lowest substrate loading rate (i.e. 2.0 g-COD/l) followed by 6.0 and 8.0 g-COD/l (Table 1 ). This particular trend of current production possibly points towards the substrate accumulation effect i.e. at higher substrate concentration VFA accumulation might hamper the metabolism of bio-alcohol fermentation bacteria same as reported in earlier studies (Lee et al., 2018). This particular assertion was further testified using CV analysis, which is the most reliable technique to understand the electrochemical kinetics of BES (Paul et al., 2018). The CV analysis was performed for MES operated under different substrate concentrations during the biomass growth cycles at stable current densities. It should be noted that all CV measurements were conducted under strict anaerobic conditions to avoid any disturbance from oxygen. The comparative CV plots obtained at different substrate concentration are shown in Fig. 2 , which demonstrates clear redox current peaks at each substrate concentrations. It is very difficult to identify current peaks corresponding to a particular reaction due to complexity of the inoculum-substrate correlation in the system and the actual reaction and electron transfer is not straightforward (Pocaznoi et al., 2012). However, the distinct redox peak appeared around the formal potential of −0.3 V to −0.5 V might point towards biofilm bound mediated electron transfer (Choi et al., 2014). Besides the peak current, which corresponds to certain redox reaction on the electrodes, large background current (non-faradic) also could be obtained. This particular behavior of CV, suggests activity of non-catalytic microbial moieties exo-polysaccharide matrix (Harnisch and Freguia, 2012). It is clear from the CV plot that the MES with 2.0 g-COD/l could produce large redox current with a value of 53 mA at reduction cycle and 75 mA at oxidation cycle. The respective current response of 30 mA and 32 mA for MES with 6.0 g-COD/l and 9.6 mA and 17 mA from MES operated with 8.0 g-COD/l was noted significantly lower. This result is also coherent with the previous current generation results as shown in Fig. 1a and thus suggesting 2.0 g-COD/l is a better substrate concentration for bio-alcohol fermentation from VFAs in MESs."
7,Effect of pH control and substrate concentration on bio-alcohols production,"3.2 Effect of pH control and substrate concentration on bio-alcohols production VFAs are considered as good building blocks for bio-alcohols, but methanogenesis need to be properly controlled to produce a high amount of bio-alcohols with minimized consumption of VFAs by methanogens. One of the most effective ways to inhibit methane formation is to apply a low pH medium configuration (Bajracharya et al., 2017). In a previous study, setting a low pH condition (pH 5) just at the beginning of experiment seemed to be not enough to suppress the methanogenic activity during operation (Gavilanes et al., 2019). This observation suggests that higher alcohol production in a MES can be guaranteed by continuously controlling pH (Ki et al., 2017). MES control reactors were initially operated with 0.8 V external power supply after initial adjustment to pH 5.0 to prevent methane-producing microorganism development. However, under this condition, no bio-alcohol production was observed, and instead methane was only the transformed product from the initial input substrate. The recovered methane concentration in terms of sCOD was noticed to be 7.3, 4.8 and 1.5 g-COD/l in MES operated with VFA concentration of 2.0, 6.0 and 8.0 g-COD/l, respectively. Additionally, fast pH recovery from 5.0 to near neutral values (7.0) was noticed over the operation time, which likely induced methanogenic activity (Choi et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2018) (Fig. 3 ). In our previous study, we also observed pH increase in a dual chamber MES with initial adjustment to pH 5. However, alcohol production was still observed, and it gradually decreased with methane production in the later operation period (35% methane in 1 day of operation to 50–60% in 5 days) (Gavilanes et al., 2019). This preferable methane production over bio-alcohols can be explained with the fact that conversion of VFAs to methane is energetically more favorable reaction from the thermodynamic point of view which agree with the observed performance during this experiment (Steinbusch et al., 2009a, 2009b). This favorable methanogenic process would utilize a large fraction of substrate by methanogenic archaea, which therefore reduces bio-alcohol production insignificant (Rajesh et al., 2018b). The MES operated at consistently maintained pH 5 (Fig. 3) demonstrated no methane gas generation under different substrate concentration, suggesting this method as highly effective for eliminating methanogens from ADS. Bio-alcohol production in MESs was peaked at fifth day of operation at each loading of VFA, probably because of generation of alcohol during the stationary bacterial growth phase (Min et al., 2013). The MESs at each operating condition produced mix bio-alcohol mainly composed with methanol, ethanol and propanol (Table 2 ). Maximum production of the individual component of mix bio-alcohol viz. ethanol, methanol and propanol was obtained from the MES at 8.0 g-COD/l, and the values were 6.9 ± 0.11 mM, 7.39 ± 0.038 mM, and 0.88 ± 0.013 mM, respectively. Reduced alcohol production was observed with the values of 5.6 ± 0.2 mM, 6.95 ± 0.76 mM and 0.9 ± 0.019 mM at 6.0 g-COD/l and 2.5 ± 0.11 mM, 0.87 ± 0.2 mM and 0.6 ± 0.085 mM at 2.0 g-COD/l, respectively (Fig. 4 ). Ethanol production was notably higher over methanol under 2.0 g-COD/l during whole operation, unlike 6.0 and 8.0 g-COD/l configurations where produced methanol amount was higher after 5-days operation possibly due to microbial growth inhibition driven by ethanol accumulation during eailer stages (Agler et al., 2011). The other study on MES reducing high concentrations of VFAs mixture (acetic and butyric acids 20.5 g-COD/l) reported possible ethanol oxidation since it was not observed after some period of time. Anaerobic bacteria could use ethanol directly as the electron donor (Sharma et al., 2013a). The produced maximum concentration of methanol, ethanol and propanol as main constituent of bio-alcohol in this study was found substantially higher compared to the methanol concentration of 3.45 mM, 0.336 mM and 0.7 mM recovered after 5 days of operation from a dual chamber MES operated under 8.0 g-COD/l VFA concentration without any methane suppression techniques. This result clearly suggests advantage of pH adjustment as methane supersession during microbial electrosynthesis of bio-alcohol from VFAs. In addition, several other authors also depicted low acidic pH as an effective strategy to suppress methanogens to reduce substrate competition between alcohol, VFA or electricity producing microorganisms (Fang and Liu, 2002; Ganigué et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2014). For example, Villano et al. (2017) reported 85% recovery of value-added products such as C2–C4 volatile fatty acids, ethanol, and hydrogen from glucose under pH ranging from 4.5 to 5.5 (Villano et al., 2017). The mechanisms of the formation of bio-alcohols in MES by mixed cultures have not been fully understood. However, it is generally suggested that the redox pairs (NADH/NAD+) shuttle electrons from cathode to microorganisms providing reducing equivalents. Electrotrophs then directly convert acetate or butyrate to their corresponding alcohols according to the following reactions (Khosravanipour Mostafazadeh et al., 2017; Logan and Rabaey, 2004) NAD + + H + + 2 e − → NADH Acetate Butyrate + n e − + n H + → bio − alcohols Clostridium species are one of the common bio-alcohols producers in MES systems. For example, C. pasteurianum accepts electrons from cathode and enhances notably the production of net NADH-consuming products such as butanol (by glucose fermentation) and 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) by glycerol fermentation (Khosravanipour Mostafazadeh et al., 2017). MES configurations with mixed cultures can handle the complexity and variability of organic wastes with efficient conversion to a mixed and variable spectrum of useful bioproducts, either esters or a mixture of alkanes and bio-alcohols, which open a novel approach in biorefinery industry (Agler et al., 2011). Furthermore, NADH consumption is higher than conventional fermentation process which requires high substrate purity and generate huge amounts of residual organic matter as byproducts (Schievano et al., 2016). Additionally, bio-alcohol fermentation in a single chamber MES in this study was found better as compared to the results obtained from a dual chamber MES operated under same conditions, but without methanogen suppression (Gavilanes et al., 2019). Furthermore, without methanogen suppression, the process turned unsustainable in the time since maximum bio-alcohols production was observed within 3-days operation before it started to decrease or being re-consumed for methane generation (Gavilanes et al., 2019). It confirms advantage of a single chamber MES over a dual chamber MES in terms of alcohol production and reactor fabrication costs. It should be noted that a dual chamber MES require to have a proton exchange membrane to separate anode and cathode, which accounts almost 62.5% of total capital cost (Ge and He, 2016). Therefore, a single chamber MES is more economical then a dual chamber MES for practical applications. Moreover, the bio-alcohol generation in this study were also noted higher as compared to the other recent studies, with no or other methanogen suppression technique applied (other than pH adjustment), suggesting superiority of pH adjustment over other methanogen suppression techniques (Table 3 ). Although heat pre-treatment can be also used in effectively suppressing methanogens in mixed cultures, this method have some possible disadvantages of reducing the value of biomass as an organic source and also causing the formation of inhibitory compounds to bio-alcohols producing bacteria (Wang and Yin, 2017). More investigations are needed to determine the optimum pretreatment method for enhancing alcohol production in full scale MES studies with economic analysis considering chemical and energy usages."
8,VFA reduction and conversion to bio-alcohols with COD balance,"3.3 VFA reduction and conversion to bio-alcohols with COD balance VFAs consumption profiles showed faster substrate degradation at the substrate loading of 2.0 g-COD/l followed by 6.0 and 8.0 g-COD/l (Fig. 5 ). Among two substrates, acetic acid was the more preferred substrate at each loading conditions and therefore recorded high reduction efficiency of 52.8%, 52% and 47.6%, respectively at 2.0, 6.0 and 8.0 g-COD/l loading rates as compared to 39.44%, 18.24% and 39.8%, respectively for butyric acid. In this study, about half of the initial acetic acid input was consumed under all substrate concentrations. However, butyric acid consumption was relatively smaller than with acetic acids possibly due to different metabolic pathways of the microorganisms attached on the cathode electrode. The preference of acetate in MES over butyrate is probably due to high toxicity of butyric acid for the alcohol fermenting microorganisms (Mamimin et al., 2017). Wu et al. (2015) reported cell growth and solvent production inhibition by smalls amounts of un-dissociated butyric acid. The enhanced degradation of acetate over butyrate suggest towards structure of acetate, which makes it more preferable for anaerobic microorganisms (Shanthi Sravan et al., 2018). However, both the substrates were used to derive methanol in earlier studies, yet the reduction pathways are unknown for mix culture consortium (Kondaveeti and Min, 2015; Sharma et al., 2013b). Therefore, it will be undesirable to make any comment on the toxicity issues of butyric acid on the alcohol-producing consortium. In addition, total reduction of VFAs in combined form was observed to be 46%, 36% and 44% in MES operated with VFA loading of 2.0 g 6.0 and 8.0 g-COD/l, clearly suggesting that the microbial consortia could not immobilize entire amount of initial VFA to the desired end product. By converting produced bio-alcohol amounts into COD basis, it is possible to get a general overview of the process. In this case, the maximum total bio-alcohols concentration after fifth day of operation of MES was found to be 0.38 ± 0.04, 1.0 ± 0.02 and 1.15 ± 0.07 g-COD/l at the substrate loading of 2.0, 6.0 and 8.0 g-COD/l, respectively. Kondaveeti and Min (2015) reported bio-alcohol production equivalent to COD concentration of around 0.3 g COD/l and 0.4 g COD/l without and with mediator (methyl viologen) utilization by a dual chambered MES reactors. Present research enhanced bio-alcohol production up to 2.8 times without need of external electron shutters or mediators in a single chamber MES. Observed differences might be due to less internal resistance in single chamber configuration, absence of ethanol-degrading microorganisms driven by methane control operation and higher obtained cathode potentials (Latif et al., 2017; Wang and Yin, 2017). The cumulative production of the bio-alcohols (ethanol, methanol and propanol) in terms of sCOD progressively increased from day zero to the end of the cycle in all the MES (Fig. 5). The equivalent concentration of bio-alcohol at day 10 of operation was noted to be 3.5 g-COD/l in the MES operated at 8.0 g-COD/l VFA, which was found to be 2.9 and 1.2-times higher than the value of 1.2 g-COD/l and 2.87 g-COD/l, respectively obtained for MES operated with the VFA concentration of 2.0 g-COD/l and 8.0 g-COD/l. The equivalent soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) removal trend was also found to be similar to the VFA reduction profile (Fig. 4). Final COD reduction efficiency after ten days of operation was also recorded higher at the loading rate of 2.0 g-COD/l with a value of 44.4% followed by 8.0 g-COD/l (42.77%) and 6.0 g-COD/l (31.2%). As methane production was not detected during operation, degradation of sCOD might be related with bacterial growth. However, sCOD values were maintained between the expected ranges, meaning that <40% of the initial sCOD was lost during operation for all substrate concentrations. Remained sCOD belongs to non-transformed VFAs and produced bio-alcohols."
9,Bio-alcohol yield and process efficiency,"3.4 Bio-alcohol yield and process efficiency The composition of bio-alcohols in this experiment was found to be consistent with organic loading rate may be due to the similarity of the microbial consortia used in the MES (Gavilanes et al., 2019). However, the product specificity and concertation could be increased by regulating the initial VFA concentration as shown in Table 1. In this case the MES operated with VFA loading rate of 2.0 g-COD/l proved to be more productive recovering the maximum bio-alcohols yield of 0.71 g-CODAlcohols/g-CODVFAs in three days of operation followed by 0.605 and 0.594 g-CODAlcohols/g-CODVFAs at the substrate loading of 6.0 and 8.0 g-COD/l, respectively (Fig. 6 ). Alcohol yield gradually decreased with time, and by the end of the batch cycle i.e. after ten days, the best performance was observed under 2.0 g-COD/l VFAs of organic load reaching yield of 0.35 ± 0.08 g-CODAlcohols/g-CODVFAs, followed by 6.0 g-COD/l (0.314 ± 0.073 g-CODAlcohols/g-CODVFAs) and 8.0 g-COD/l (0.248 ± 0.041 g-CODAlcohols/g-CODVFAs). Moreover, bio-alcohol yield is representing the amount of bio-alcohols that were recovered from the converted substrate, achieving a final conversion efficiency of 35% for the MES operated with 2 g-COD/l followed by 31.4% and 24.8%, respectively for MES operated at 6.0 g-COD/l and 8.0 g-COD/l. The lower alcohol yield under relatively high VFA concentrations (6.0 g-and 8.0 g- COD/l) could be due to high initial VFA concentration and more alcohol accumulations. Butyric acid has been reported as highly toxic for alcohol producer microbes (Appels et al., 2008; Mamimin et al., 2017; Villano et al., 2017). Moreover, these results are comparable with the conversion efficiency of 35% obtained for ethanol production with hydrogen as electron donor in an earlier study by Steinbusch et al. (2008). In this study, external mediator was not used for electron shuttling, suggesting it as a sustainable method for bio-alcohol production with less complications and energy spent than conventional alcohol production methods using external electron donors (Steinbusch et al., 2008)."
10,Conclusion,"This study demonstrates continuous pH adjustment as an excellent strategy to suppress methanogenesis for improving bio-alcohol fermentation in MES. Maximum bio-alcohol production was noted in fifth day of operation and highest concentration was recorded for the MES with 8.0 g-COD/l; whereas the MES with 2.0 g-COD/l outperformed others MESs in terms of methane yield. In addition, electrochemical properties of MES with 2.0 g-COD/l was noted higher than the other VFA loadings, leading to achieve the highest overall conversion efficiency of 35%. This suggests optimum VFA loading and low pH control are essentially required for efficient alcohol production in MES."
