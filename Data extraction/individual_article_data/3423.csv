0,Introduction,"Dependence on fossil fuels as the main energy sources has led to serious energy crisis and environmental problems. Therefore, due to the environmental considerations as well as the increasing demand for energy in the world, more attention has been paid to develop new energy sources [1]. Owing to that, there has been interest in the utilization of biomass for production of environmental friendly biofuels. As known, biomass is a CO2 neutral resource in the life cycle, while CO2 is a primary contributor to the global greenhouse effect. Hence, increasing attention is being paid to biomass as a substitute for fossil fuel to reduce the global greenhouse effect, particularly under the commitment of the Kyoto Protocol. Biomass used as an energy resource can be efficiently achieved by thermo-chemical conversion technology: pyrolysis, gasification or combustion. Gasification process is one of the most promising thermo-chemical conversion routes to recover energy from biomass. During gasification process, biomass is thermal decomposed to small quantities of char and ash, liquid oil and high production of gaseous products under limited presence of oxygen following Eq. (1). The yields of end products of gasification and the composition of gases are dependent on several parameters including temperature, biomass species, particle size, heating rate, operating pressure and reactor configuration [2]. (1) Biomass + heat → H 2 + CO + CO 2 + CH 4 + Hydrocarbon + Char The concern of using biomass in gasification to produce a hydrogen rich product has been getting particular attention in recent years. The reasons may be attributed to: (1) hydrogen is a clean and efficient energy source and is expected to take an important role in a future energy demand; (2) hydrogen is a safe source and can be easily stored as a gas or a liquid; (3) hydrogen has good properties in fuelling engines in automobiles; and (4) most important, current and future energy technologies are extensively increasing the possibility of utilizing hydrogen with economic acceptance. Apparently, how to force the biomass gasification process into shift towards the maximum hydrogen rich end product is becoming a priority topic [3]. Various types of biofuels can be produced from gasification process after catalytically upgrading the syngas by using Fischer–Tropsch (FTS) synthesis and Higher Alcohol synthesis (HAS) technologies [4]. Through the FTS reaction, syngas can be converted to a wide range of long chain hydrocarbon products, like gasoline, naphtha, diesel and wax. The long chain hydrocarbons produced from the FTS reaction are distilled and hydro-cracked before being used as a liquid transportation fuel [5]. There are also many types of alcohols such as methanol and ethanol that can be produced using HAS technology. The syngas produced from gasification process will be catalytically converted to alcohols under this technology. Ethanol is an important renewable liquid fuel for motor vehicles. The production of ethanol from biomass can significantly reduce both the dependency on fossil fuel sources and environmental pollution [6]. Oil palm (Elaeis guianensis) originally originates from West Africa. It grows well in wet and humid places like Malaysia. In the present time Malaysia is the world’s largest producer and exporter of palm oil. Its currently accounts for 51% of the world palm oil production and 62% of the world exports. Palm oil production in Malaysia has increased from 2.57 million metric tons in 1980 to 17.8 million metric tons in 2009 [7]. Beside palm oil availability, Malaysian palm oil also generates huge quantity of oil palm biomass including oil palm trunks, oil palm fronds, empty fruit bunches (EFB), shells and fibers in the production of palm oil. There was annual generation of 9.66, 5.20 and 17.08 million tons for fiber, shell and empty fruit bunches respectively [8]. Oil palm is a multipurpose plantation and also a prolific producer of biomass as raw materials for value-added industries [9]. For example, fresh fruit bunch contains only 21% palm oil, while the rest 6–7% palm kernel, 14–15% fiber, 6–7% shell and 23% empty fruit bunch (EFB) are left as biomass [10]. In Malaysia, there has been a strong interest in the utilization of oil palm biomass for the production of environmental friendly biofuels. The implementation of biofuels program in Malaysia is in line with the government policy in ensuring a sustainable development of the energy sector as well as promoting a clean environment. For examples, the government has embarked on the growth of renewable energy as the fifth fuel after oil, gas, hydro, and coal, initiated earlier under the Third Outline Perspective Plan (OPP3), 2000–2010 [11], and the ninth Malaysian plan (9MP), 2006–2010 [12]. Till now, a lot of work has been done and many processes are being investigated on hydrogen-rich gas production from biomasses [13–18]. Among them, thermo-chemical processes (gasification and pyrolysis) are the most promising and applied solutions for “second generation fuels”. Presently, many research works related to the gasification of biomass using different operating processes such as types of gasifiers (fixed bed, moving bed and fluidized bed), gasification agents (air, oxygen, steam or their mixtures) and operating conditions (temperature, pressure, equivalent ratio (ER)) have been presented and extensive researches have been conducted on small and medium size air gasifiers to produce low BTU fuel gas and power [19–26]. Gasifying agent is one of the most important parameters in the gasification process. It plays an important role during the gasification reactions. The agent can be air, pure oxygen, steam or their mixtures. Air is cheap and widely used in the gasification process, however, it contains large amount of nitrogen, which reduces the heating value of the syngas produced. On the other hand, if pure oxygen is used, the heating value of syngas will increase but at the same time, the operating costs will also increase due to the oxygen production [27], and the same can be said for using steam as gasifying agent. The low calorific value syngas produced from air gasification can be directly utilized as fuel for gas turbines and gas engines [28] or can used as an industrial feedstock for heat and power generation. Yet, the condensable organic compounds (tar) need to be removed using hot gas cleaning method or catalytic reforming of tar. Currently, oil palm biomass (shell, fiber and EFB) can be converted to the high-value products via thermo-chemical conversion processes. Yang et al. [21] have investigated the use of the palm oil wastes as a feedstock to produce hydrogen-rich gas via pyrolysis process in fixed bed reactor. The authors reported that the palm oil wastes could be ideal biomass sources for biofuels production The total gas yield was enhanced by increasing reactor temperature with the maximum ∼70wt.% of gas yield achieved per raw biomass sample with good portions of H2 (33.49vol.%). Kelly-Yong et al. [29] have studied the thermodynamic analysis of hydrogen production from oil palm biomass in gasification reaction using supercritical water (SCW) technology. The authors reported that the utilization of SCW medium in biomass gasification can directly deal with high moisture content of biomass (>50%). Therefore, preliminary treatment such as biomass drying could be avoided which will automatically reduce the operating cost of the process. In addition, the feasibility study of obtaining hydrogen from palm oil biomass (0.117kg H2 kg−1 biomass) was obtained. Abdullah et al. [30] investigated the fast pyrolysis of EFB using 150g/h fluidized-bed reactor to produce bio-oil. The results showed that the maximum bio-oil production was 55.1wt.% at 450°C at only 1.03s vapor residence time. This study focuses on using EFB, a waste from the palm oil industry as a feedstock material using air gasification process in bench scale fluidized bed gasifier. Different operation conditions namely reactor temperature, feedstock particle size and equivalence ratio will be investigated to achieve an improved performance of EFB conversion to energy with a high yield of hydrogen-rich gas."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Feedstock preparation and properties,"2.1 Feedstock preparation and properties The EFB sample investigated in this study was collected from Seri Ulu Langat palm oil mill, Dengkil, Selangor. EFB used in this work is the biomass remaining as a by-product of industrial process after removal of the nuts. Samples received were relatively dry having less than 10wt.% moisture, and were in the form of whole bunches. Particle size reduction was required to allow gasification of the EFB on the available 600g/h reactor. The bunches were first manually chopped into small pieces that could be fed in a shredder. After that, a Fritsch grinder with a screen size of 1.0mm was used to obtain the feedstock size of less than 1.0mm. The distribution of feed particle size after grinding is given in Table 1 . After extensive feeding trials, it is found that only particles between 0.3 and 1.0mm were easily fed. Both the size fraction below and above this range frequently led to blockage of the available feeder. The proximate and elemental analyses were carried out in a TGA (Mettler-Toledo TGA/SDTA 851) and CHNS/O analyzer (LECO CHNS932), respectively. The results are listed in Table 2 . EFB had a very high volatile content (>80wt.%) and low amounts of fixed carbon (<10wt.%). The calorific value of EFB (∼17MJ/kg) was measured in a bomb calorimeter (Parr 1341); this is lower than that of coal, possibly due to the low fixed carbon and high oxygen contents in the EFB [31]. The ultimate analysis indicates that EFB is environmental friendly, with trace amounts of nitrogen, sulfur and mineral matter."
3,Experimental procedure,"A fluidized bed bench scale gasification unit operating at atmospheric pressure was employed for all runs. Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of this unit, which consists of three main systems: reactor (gasification reactor and heating furnace), condenser and purification (condenser, glass wool filter and dryer) and gas storage (gasbags). The reactor is a cylindrical configuration made of stainless steel with a length of 600mm and a diameter of 40mm. Three thermocouples were inserted in the middle of the heating furnace, middle of the reactor tube and bottom of the reactor tube, respectively. Biomass was fed into the reactor by a feeder on the top of the reactor, which were continuously carried out at a constant flow rate. The feeding capacity of biomass was 10g/min. The heating medium in the reactor was inert sand of size between 0.3 and 0.5mm. The fluidizing gas was air, entering from the base of the reactor. The condensable part of the product gas was collected from the ice water condenser, whereas the incondensable gases leaved the system through glass wool/silica gel filter and then were collected by gasbags for gas chromatography (GC) analysis. The tar product was trapped in the water cooler, ice condenser walls and glass wool/silica gel filter. Dichloromethane (DCM) was used to remove the tar from condenser walls and filter. The dissolved product was then filtered using filter paper and the filtrate was heated in an oven at 70°C for about 2h to evaporate any rising solution. The heated filtrate was then weighed to get the weight of tar. The yield of the products was quantified as mass basis. The solid product called charcoal was removed from the reactor and separated from the sand bed then weighed to get the solid mass. The yield of the total product gas was then calculated by difference."
4,Product gas analysis,"3.1 Product gas analysis 0.5mL of the product gas was analyzed in gas chromatography (GC) Agilent Technologies model HP6890N with TCD and FID detectors. A 30m HP-Molesieve capillary column was used to separate the permanent gases. The internal diameter and film thickness of the column were 0.53mm and 0.5μm, respectively. The oven temperature was set at 70°C and carrier gas flow rate (Argon) was 6mL/min. The splitless inlet and TCD detector temperature were 60 and 200°C, respectively. The TCD was calibrated with standard gas (Air Product, Malaysia) mixture containing CO, CO2, H2 and CH4 in nitrogen at periodic intervals."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Thermogravimetric analysis of EFB,"4.1 Thermogravimetric analysis of EFB The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed under 10mL/min air with a heating rate of 10°C/min. The thermal degradation characteristics of different particle size dried feedstock are displayed in Fig. 2 by thermogravimetry (TG) and differential thermogravimetry curves (DTG), respectively. The EFB samples showed a small DTG peaks around 100°C, which are indicative to the moisture content, followed by big peaks around 300°C, which are indicative to the decomposition of cellulose and hemicellulose, while the humps apparent around 450°C are indicative to the decomposition of lignin. Similar weight loss rate was observed in other researches [32,33]. The distinction between hemicellulose and cellulose breakdowns was not fully understood but it had been established that hemicellulose broke down at lower temperature compared to cellulose [34]."
7,Effect of reactor bed temperature on product yields,"4.2 Effect of reactor bed temperature on product yields The yields of final products from EFB gasification under different temperatures are shown in Fig. 3 . As shown in Fig. 3a with temperature increasing from 700 to 1000°C, the total gas yields increased sharply from 62.68 to 91.7wt.%, while liquid, char and tar yields reduced gradually. Meanwhile, varying temperature showed a great influence on gas product components. The main gas products are H2, CO, CO2, CH4 and some C2 hydrocarbons traces (C2H4 and C2H6). As shown in Fig. 3b, H2 content increased progressively from 10.27 to 38.02vol.% as temperature increased from 700 to 1000°C. CH4 yield also increased from 5.84 to 14.72vol.%., whilst CO2 content decreased in general with temperature increasing, particularly at 1000°C. The CO yield was initially increased from 21.87 to 33.35vol.% as temperature increased to 800°C, then decreased to 33.08vol.% at temperature 900°C, before it increased again to 36.36vol.% as temperature continuously increased to 1000°C. The C2H4 and C2H6 yields were relatively small and the influence of temperature was insignificant. The thermal cracking of gas-phase hydrocarbons at high temperature might explain the variation of gas product distribution observed [35]. At high furnace temperature, the gas species generated from biomass at pyrolysis zone could undergo further reactions (secondary reactions) such as tar cracking and shifting reaction, leading to much more incondensable gases (including H2) generated. Therefore, the total yield of gases products increased significantly as temperature increased from 700 to 1000°C. The main reactions involved could be expressed using the following Eqs. (2)–(10) [35,36]. Among them, Eqs. (2)–(6) are principle or heterogenous gasification reactions whilst Eqs. (7)–(11) are homogenous and secondary reactions. In terms of increasing H2 production, Eqs. (5), (7)–(10) are the main reactions of interest for EFB gasification at atmospheric pressure and temperature between 700 and 1000°C. The other gases component might increase or decrease with the occurring of secondary reactions. As a result, more H2 can be obtained when secondary reactions occur significantly. From the above analysis, it can be concluded that higher temperature (1000°C) is favorable for thermal cracking of tar and shift reaction. (2) C + O 2 → CO 2 (3) C + ( 1 / 2 ) O 2 → CO (4) C + CO 2 → 2 CO (5) C + H 2 O ( g ) → CO + H 2 (6) C + 2 H 2 → CH 4 (7) CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2 (8) CH 4 + H 2 O ( g ) → CO + 3 H 2 (9) CH 4 + CO 2 → 2 CO + 2 H 2 (10) Tar + H 2 O ( g ) → CO + H 2 O + CH 4 + H 2 + C m H n (11) C m H n + n H 2 O → nCO + [ n + ( m / 2 ) H 2 ] The lower heating value (LHV, MJ/m3) of the gas products can be calculated using the following equation [21,35]. (12) LHV = ( 30.0 x CO + 25.7 x H 2 + 85.4 x CH 4 + 151.3 x C n H m ) x 4.2 CO, H2, CH4 and CnHm in the above equation are the molar ratio of the CO, H2, CH4 and other hydrocarbon (C2H2 and C2H6) in the gas product. As shown in Fig. 3a, the heating value of total gas products increase steadily as the temperature increases. At 1000°C, LHV of gas products reached 15.55MJ/m3, which belongs to be medium level of heat values for gas fuels that can be directly used for gas engine, gas turbine or boiler for power generation. Also it can be used for the chemical formation of methanol and methane [31]."
8,Effect of feedstock particle size on product yields,"4.3 Effect of feedstock particle size on product yields The second series of experiment was performed to establish the effect of feedstock particle size on the EFB gasification product yields. In this study, the experiments were conducted by using three different feedstock particle size ranges, namely <0.3mm, 0.3–0.5mm and 0.5–1.0mm with constant reactor temperature of 850°C. As shown in Fig. 4 a, the smallest particle size of <0.3mm produced a gas yield of 74.79wt.%, about 2% higher than larger particle size of 0.5–1.0mm, which produced a gas yield of 72.74wt.%, while particles size of 0.3–0.5 produced a gas yield 73.33wt.%. The total gas yield decreased with feedstock particle size increased, while char and tar yields increased with increasing of feedstock particle size. An increase in feedstock particle size causes greater temperature gradient inside the particle so that at a given time the core temperature is lower than of the surface, which possibly gives rise to an increase in the char and liquids yields and decrease in gases [37]. Fig. 4b showed that the smaller EFB particles produced more CO, CH4 and less CO2 than the larger ones, while hydrogen yields was almost the same (32.99 and 33.93vol.%) for particles size of <0.3mm and 0.3–0.5mm, respectively, then decreased to 21.57vol.%. for particle size of 0.5–1.0mm. However, in this study it was observed that the smallest feedstock particle size of <0.3mm obtained maximum yield of gas product, while the feedstock particle size in range of 0.3–0.5mm obtained the optimum gas composition and highest LHV of gas product."
9,Effect of equivalence ratio (ER) on product yields,"4.4 Effect of equivalence ratio (ER) on product yields The equivalence ratio (ER) is defined as the ratio of oxygen (air) required for gasification to oxygen (air) required for stoichiometric combustion of a given amount of biomass [38]. In this work, ER was varied from 0.15 to 0.35 in increments of 0.05, keeping final temperature of the reactor at 850°C and feedstock particle size at range of 0.3–0.5mm. The air flow rate entering the reactor was varied to investigate the effect of ER. As shown in Fig. 5 a, with increased in ER, char and tar yield decreased from 13.65 to 2.12wt.% and 9.83 to 2.82wt.% respectively, while gas yield increased from 70.75 to 86.46wt.%. The lower heating value (LHV) of the gases decreased slightly from 15.38 to 12.35MJ/m3. Increase in ER increases oxidation reaction and decrease the product gas quality. However, too high ER cause low concentrations of H2 and CO with high CO2 content in the product gas. As shown in Fig. 5b, with ER varied from 0.15 to 0.35, the H2 content increased and reached to maximum value of 27.42vol.% at ER of 0.25 and then dropped to 18.37vol.% with further increase in ER, while the CO2 content increased steadily, from 16.66vol.% to 36.05vol.%; CH4 and other hydrocarbons traces content were on the contrary. It can be explained that in the gasification process, oxidization reactions are always strong, and oxidization reactions of combustible product gases strengthen with ER, which results in more CO2. Several groups [39–41] investigated the effect of ER in air gasification of biomass in a fluidized bed gasifier. They found that with increase in ER, H2, CO increased initially and then decreased, while CO2, CH4 and other hydrocarbons content were progressively decreased, which are similar with our findings. Through the analysis on the experimental results of varying ER, it can be understood that the optimum value for ER is 0.25, which maximum hydrogen content can be obtained."
10,Cost analysis,"Performance data of fluidized bed biomass gasifier system used in this study is given in Table 3 . Due to the low efficiency of bench scale gasification unit, the system needs to be scaling-up. The principal costs of H2 production from EFB biomass using fluidized bed gasifier are estimated as follows: It is assumed that 6kg/h (144kg/d) of EFB would be the raw material for gasification process to produce 0.052kg H2/kg EFB (7.48kg H2/d=84.13Nm3/d). The capital cost of this system covers fluidized bed gasifier, furnace and construction expenditure. Costs of operation, interest, maintenance and other expenses are assumed as shown in Table 4 . Based on the operating parameters and data of capital cost, the calculation result of H2 product cost from this system is RM 6.7 for every kilograms of EFB which is equal to $2.11/kg EFB ($0.18/Nm3). For comparison, Table 5 presents other researcher’s cost analysis on H2 through different processes."
11,Conclusions,"In this study, air gasification of EFB, one of the most abundant biomass found in Malaysia, was carried out in bench scale fluidized bed gasifier. The operating parameters namely reactor temperature, biomass particle size and equivalence ratio were tested to determine their effects on total products yields, product gas composition and LHV gas. The main products of EFB air gasification were solid charcoal, liquid oil, tar and hydrogen-rich gas product. Temperature was an important factor in this process. As the temperature increased from 700 to 1000°C the gas yield increased significantly whilst solid, liquid and tar yields progressively decreased. The gas products mainly consisted of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4. High temperature is favorable for the increasing gas products including H2, CO, CH4. The LHV gas increased with temperature and reached to 15.55MJ/m3 at 1000°C. The EFB particle size had an influence on the total gas yield and gas composition; smaller EFB particle size produced more CH4, CO and less CO2. On top of that, LHV gas increased with smaller EFB particle size. ER had complex effect on the gasification products. The ER of 0.25 was found to be optimum to yield a maximum H2 production of 27.31vol.% at 850°C in this work. Based on the operating parameters and data of capital cost, the estimation cost of H2 from this system is RM 6.7/kg EFB ($2.11/kg EFB=$0.18/Nm3)."
