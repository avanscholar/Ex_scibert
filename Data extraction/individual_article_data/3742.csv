0,Introduction,"Higher alcohols usually include C1 to C6 alcohols, which have good value for use as cleaning fuels, petrochemical feedstocks and gasoline additives for increasing the octane number. The synthesis of higher alcohol from syngas (derived from coal, biomass and natural gas) has attracted wide attention due to the scarcity of energy resources and environmental protection. In the past few decades, several catalyst systems for the synthesis of higher alcohols have been developed, including noble metal Rh-based catalysts, modified methanol synthesis catalysts, modified Fischer–Tropsch (FT) synthesis catalysts, and Mo-based catalysts [1]. Initially, MoS2-based catalysts were mainly used in hydrodesulfurization in the petroleum industry, which have the advantages of no noble metal component, high resistance to sulfur poisoning and less deactivation by coking [2]. In the 1980s, Dow Chemical Company reported that the alkali metal promoted MoS2-based catalyst shows high activity and selectivity for the higher alcohol synthesis from syngas [3]. The addition of alkali metal promotes the associative adsorption of CO through a formate mechanism and reduces the hydrogenation activity of the catalyst, thereby increasing significantly the selectivity and STY to alcohols. On the other hand, the alkali metal promoters can neutralize the surface acidity of catalyst, inhibiting the dehydration reaction of alcohol products [4]. Further research found that the addition of Co, Ni, Rh and Pd promoters is favorable for improving the alcohol production, especially the C2+OH selectivity [5]. For a K-modified MoS2 catalyst, the incorporation of cobalt can result in the substantial structure changes and promote the alcohol chain growth. The incorporated Co atoms mainly exist in two major forms: Co–Mo–S or Co9S8 phases, which have very different catalytic properties. The Co–Mo–S phase is suggested to be the active site for CO non-dissociative/dissociative adsorption, non-dissociative CO insertion, carbon chain growth and thus favorable for the alcohol formation. While the Co9S8 phase which promotes CO and H2 dissociative adsorption is involved in the formation of by-product hydrocarbons and inactive for the alcohol synthesis [6–8]. The composition of the two phases strongly depends on the preparation methods [9]. The common methods for the preparation of alkali modified Co-MoS2 catalysts include impregnation/coprecipitation methods, reverse microemulsion technique and mechano-chemical activation and so on [6,10,11]. Taking the impregnation as an example, the as-prepared Co-MoS2 catalyst mainly contained the Co–Mo–S phase if the Co/Mo atomic ratio less than 0.4. Higher cobalt content will result in the formation of Co9S8 [12]. The activation of catalyst before reaction also has a significant impact on the catalytic performance, because major physical and chemical restructuring seems to take place during the activation. The relevant studies on the bimetallic CoCu synthesis alcohol catalyst reveal that CO-activated catalyst shows higher activity and Anderson–Schulz–Flory (ASF) chain lengthening probability than pure H2- or syngas-activated catalyst, but alcohol selectivity is relatively lower [13]. Detailed characterization results indicate that major restructuring occurs during activation. The CO activation leads to the segregation of Co on the catalyst surface and forms an “onion-like” graphitic carbon shell. So far, few studies have been made on the activation of Mo catalysts. Our previous work reported that for the Mo-based oxide catalyst, the syngas-activated catalyst shows the highest activity for the synthesis of higher alcohols than that of the pure H2- or CO-activated catalysts [14]. The reason is attributed to that the syngas activation had an appropriate reduction capacity and produced a large amount of Moδ+ (1 < δ < 4) species and multivalent state Co species on the surface of catalyst. Their synergistic effects enhance the cooperativity and equilibrium between the CO dissociation, hydrogenation and CO insertion and thus promotes the formation of higher alcohols. For the sulfide K2CO3/MoS2 catalyst, Sun et al. reported that the pretreatment with H2, CO or syngas before reaction could effectively shorten the time of induction period and promote the catalytic activity [15]. The reason is suggested to be related to the sulfur losing and K element dispersion on the surface of catalyst. In this paper, we synthesized a nanosheets structured K–Co–MoS2 by a one-step hydrothermal synthesis combined with the wetness impregnation and investigated the influence of the activation procedure on the catalytic performance. The catalyst structures were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the catalytic performance for the higher alcohols synthesis was investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The K–Co–MoS2 catalysts were prepared by a hydrothermal method combined with incipient wetness impregnation. (NH4)6Mo7O24•4H2O (99.0%), Co(NO3)2•6H2O (98.5%), CS(NH2)2 (99.0%) and K2CO3 (99.0%) were supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd and used as received without any pretreatment. Firstly, the Co-MoS2 composite was prepared by a hydrothermal method. In a typical procedure, 1.3568 g of (NH4)6Mo7O24•4H2O was dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water. After complete dissolving, 2.3400 g of CS(NH2)2 and 0.8947 g of Co(NO3)2•6H2O were added in turn to the solution under stirring, and formed a red transparent solution. The solution volume was adjusted to 90 mL by adding deionized water. After stirring for 30 min, the mixed solution was transferred to a 150 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. Then the Teflon-lined autoclave was sealed and heated at 473 K for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained black precipitate was collected, washed by ethanol and deionized water for several times, and then dried at 323 K for 12 h. The as-prepared Co-MoS2 was then impregnated with K2CO3 aqueous solution. After ultrasonic dispersion for 20 min, the mixture was dried at 338 K for 3 h and calcined in flowing argon at 723 K for 90 min. The atomic ratios of K/Mo and Co/Mo were 0.5 and 0.6, respectively."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Power X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Rigaku D/max-γA rotating-anode diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source at 40 kV and 200 mA with a scan range of 10°–70°. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed using a JEM-2100F field emission transmission electron microscopy, a JEM-2010 transmission electron microscopy and a H-7650 transmission electron microscopy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was collected on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The binding energy of C 1 s (284.8 eV) was used as a reference to correct the binding energy of the catalysts. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was determined by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K using a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 analyzer."
4,Catalytic activity measurement,"2.3 Catalytic activity measurement The catalytic activity was measured in a fixed bed stainless steel reactor with an internal diameter of 8 mm. In each experiment, 0.5 g of catalyst was mixed with quartz sand to obtain a total volume of 2 mL, which was then loaded in the reactor tube. Before reaction, the catalyst was first activated in a flow of activation gas (pure H2 or 5% H2/N2) under 400 °C for 8 h. Then the reactor temperature was lowered to the reaction temperature and syngas (30% CO, 60% H2 and 10% N2) was introduced into the reactor. The product gas was cooled down in a trap surrounded by ice-water and separated into gas and liquid phase under reaction pressure. The details of the product analysis were described in our previous work [16]. All activity measurements were performed at 5.0 MPa, 583 K, and Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) of 4800 h−1. Because the alcohol synthesis required an induction period, all the activity data shown in this study was measured after more than 48 h of reaction. The intrinsic activity of the catalyst, as expressed by the approximate turnover frequencies (TOFs) for C2+OH formation and CO conversion was estimated assuming all surface Mo atoms are active. The accurate TOFs cannot be assessed due to the lack of a suitable probe molecule to titrate the amount of active sites [17]. In this work, the surface amount of Mo atoms was calculated based on the XPS and BET results, as suggested by the literatures [18,19]. The TOFs values for C2+OH formation and CO conversion were calculated according to the following equations. TO F C 2 + OH ( s − 1 · per surface Mo ) = mol C 2 + OH ( s − 1 ) · N A No . surface Mo atoms TO F co ( s − 1 · per surface Mo ) = mol reacted CO ( s − 1 ) · N A No . surface Mo atoms Where N A is the Avogadro constant, the No. surface Mo atoms represents the amount of surface Mo atoms, which is determined by the following formula. No . surface Mo atoms = No . surface total atoms × surface Mo atomic content ( % ) No . surface total atoms = surface area ( 0.5 g catalyst ) ∑ i = 1 … n X i × A i Where Xi is the surface atomic content of i atom, which is obtained from the XPS result. Ai is the surface area of i atom, which is estimated according to the ion radius. The BET surface area of catalyst is 0.9363 m2/g."
5,Results and discussion,
6,XRD results,"3.1 XRD results The XRD patterns of the catalysts activated in different atmospheres and then reacted for 48 h are shown in Fig. 1 . For comparison, the XRD pattern of the fresh sample is also presented. The fresh K–Co–MoS2 catalyst shows very weak diffraction intensities, indicating a low crystallization degree. The peaks at 13.7°, 33.1°, 39.8°, 58.9° are attributed to MoS2 and those at 27.9°, 36.2°, 46.7°, 55.0° correspond to CoS2 species. Besides, the CoMo2S4 (2θ = 15.4°, 31.1°) phase is also detected. It is worth noting that no any peaks assigned to Co9S8 are found. The results indicate that for the preparation of Co-MoS2 catalysts, hydrothermal synthesis can more effectively inhibit the formation of Co9S8 phase as compared to other methods, such as the impregnation or sulfuration [12]. After activated and reacted, the diffraction peaks assigned to Co9S8 were observed (2θ = 29.8°, 47.5°, 52.1°), as shown in Fig. 1. The different activation conditions have different impacts on the formation of Co9S8. By comparison, the sample activated in pure H2 shows weaker diffraction intensities of Co9S8 than that of the sample activated in 5% H2/N2, indicating that the pure H2 activation inhibits effectively the formation of Co9S8 during the reaction."
7,TEM results,"3.2 TEM results The morphology and structure of the as-prepared MoS2, Co–MoS2 and K–Co–MoS2 catalyst were characterized by TEM technique. As shown in Fig 2 (a), the MoS2 exists as thin 2D nanosheets with the lateral size more than 100 nm. Moreover, the MoS2 nanosheets are interconnected with each other due to high surface energy of 2D materials, forming the 3D petal-like structure and indicating that the few-layer nanosheets are flexible and foldable. After the incorporation of Co and K, as shown in Fig. 2(b and c), the obtained Co-MoS2 and K–Co–MoS2 particles remain the layered nanosheets structure and no aggregation occur, indicating that the incorporated Co and K are well dispersed and anchored on the MoS2 nanosheets. Fig. 2(d) shows the HRTEM image of the K–Co–MoS2 nanosheets, in which the characteristic interlayer distance of 0.63 nm for 2H-MoS2 is detected, corresponding to the (002) plane of MoS2. Furthermore, the nanosheets organized MoS2 shows exposed edge sites and abundant defects, which are regarded as the active center for CO hydrogenation [20,21]. Another group of lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.25 nm is assigned to the (210) plane of CoS2. The HRTEM image clearly confirms that the Co atoms are located at the edges of MoS2 nanosheets and form a tight binding between each other, displaying the advantage of hydrothermal synthesis. The used catalysts are also investigated by TEM technique. As shown in the Fig. 3 , the catalysts activated in different atmospheres show different degrees of aggregation after reaction. The sample activated by 5% H2/N2 aggregates obviously and forms some large size, irregular particles after reaction. In contrast, no significant aggregation is observed for the catalyst particles activated by pure H2, suggesting that the high pure hydrogen can inhibit the aggregation of catalyst particles during the reaction."
8,XPS results,"3.3 XPS results The surface chemical composition of the fresh and used K–Co–MoS2 catalysts is analyzed by XPS technique. Fig. 4 shows the XPS spectra of Mo 3d for the K–Co–MoS2 catalysts. For the fresh K–Co–MoS2 catalyst, the characteristic binding energies of Mo4+ 3d 5/2 (229.5 eV) and Mo4+ 3d 3/2 (232.8 eV) are observed. After reaction, the Mo valence state of K–Co–MoS2 catalysts remains unchanged. It is noted that the binding energy of Mo4+ of the catalyst activated by pure H2 shifted obviously to lower levels compared to that of the catalyst activated in 5%H2/N2 at same temperature. Similar result is also observed for the S 2p spectra as shown in Fig. 5 . The reason can be attributed to that pure H2 activation promotes the electron transfer from Co to increases the electron cloud density, intensifies the electromagnetic shield for the inner shell electron due to the formation of SH groups, and thus decreases the electron binding energy. The XPS spectra of Co 2p for the fresh and used K–Co–MoS2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 6 . From the Co 2p core-level spectra, the binding energies of 779.3 eV and 794.2 eV are assigned to Co 2p 3/2 and Co 2p 1/2, respectively, confirming the existence of CoS2 species [22,23]. Furthermore, the difference of binding energy between Co 2p 3/2 and Mo 3d 5/2 with 549.8 eV is relatively close to the value of 550.0 eV reported in the literature with the cobalt atoms located in a MoS2 phase [24,25], which is regarded as an evidence for the formation of Co–Mo–S phase. Based on the fact and combined with TEM results, it is suggested that Co atoms in CoS2 are located on the edges of MoS2 platelets, forming the Co–Mo–S phase. The peaks at 781.8 eV and 798.2 eV and two satellite peaks at 784.1 eV and 801.5 eV are attributed to the Co2+ in the Co9S8, in good agreement with the previous reports [26]. For the fresh K–Co–MoS2 catalyst, the Co 2p peak assigned to CoS2 is strong while that of Co9S8 is very weak, indicating that the Co atoms in fresh catalyst are mainly in the form of Co–Mo–S phase. The different activation conditions have different impacts on the existing state of cobalt. After activated by 5% H2, the Co 2p peaks corresponding to Co9S8 increase significantly after reaction, revealing that a large amount of Co atoms are separated from the Co–Mo–S to form the Co9S8. In contrast, the pure H2-activated catalyst shows relatively weaker Co 2p peaks of Co9S8, indicated that the pure H2 activation can more effectively inhibit the formation of Co9S8 during the reaction, in accordance with the XRD and TEM results."
9,Catalytic performance,"3.4 Catalytic performance The catalytic performance for higher alcohol synthesis over the K–Co–MoS2 catalysts was tested and the activity data have been recorded after an induction period of 48 h. As shown in Fig. 7 , the catalyst activated in pure H2 shows the higher activity toward the higher CO conversion and alcohol selectivity compared to the sample activated in 5% H2. Furthermore, the selectivity to C2+OH increases significantly. The intrinsic activity of the catalyst, as expressed by the approximate turnover frequencies (TOFs) for C2+OH formation and CO conversion was evaluated assuming all surface Mo atoms are active (Table 1 ). The accurate TOFs cannot be assessed due to the lack of a suitable probe molecule to titrate the amount of active sites [17]. In this work, the surface amount of Mo atoms was calculated based on the XPS and BET results, as suggested by the literatures [18,19]. First, the surface atomic concentration was obtained through the XPS analysis. Then combined with the BET result and ion radius data, the amount of surface Mo atoms was estimated and used for calculating the TOFs per surface Mo. From the Table 1, the catalyst activated in pure H2 has the higher intrinsic activity. The TOFs values for CO conversion and C2+OH formation are 0.33 s−1 and 0.04 s−1, respectively, higher than that of the Rh-based catalyst [27,28], which is the most selective catalyst for the C2+OH production (mainly ethanol). For the MoS2-based catalysts, cobalt is an effective promoter for improving the C2+OH selectivity and STY of total alcohol. The incorporated Co atoms mainly exist in two major forms: Co–Mo–S or Co9S8 phases. Systematic researches on preparation–structure–activity relationship indicate that the two phases have very different catalytic properties [29,30]. Co9S8 contributes little to the alcohol production, and it is stable under typical reaction conditions. The Co–Mo–S phase is generally regarded as the active phase for the formation of C2+ alcohols, because those active H-species could be easily adsorbed on the Co–Mo–S sites via the hydrogen spillover and thus increasing the rate of hydrogenation reaction [31]. The generally accepted model of Co–Mo–S phase proposed by Topsoe and Topsoe [32] consists of MoS2 particles with Co atoms located at the edges of the MoS2 slabs. The sulfur atom is shared between Co and Mo and the electron transfer from Co to Mo involves an electron transfer from Co–S bond to a Mo–S bond [33]. The content of the two phases (Co–Mo–S and Co9S8) strongly depends on the catalyst preparation method and the Co concentration [8]. For the presented catalyst synthesized via the hydrothermal method, the characterization results clearly demonstrate that the Co atoms are mainly located at the edge of MoS2 nanosheets, forming the Co–Mo–S phase. No separated Co9S8 phase is found ever if the Co/Mo atomic ratio is up to 0.6, showing an obvious advantage in comparison to the conventional impregnation method [12]. The structural feature leads to a high dispersion of active sites on the catalyst surface, thus showing a high intrinsic activity for higher alcohol synthesis. The syngas-exposure reaction environment easily results in the separation of the Co atoms from the edge of MoS2 to form the Co9S8, and therefore reduces the catalyst activity, especially the C2+OH selectivity [34]. The catalyst activation before reaction can inhibit effectively the formation of Co9S8. For the presented K–Co–MoS2 catalyst, the characterization results indicate that the pure H2 activation can suppress the separation of Co atoms maximally and remains most of the Co atoms in the form of Co–Mo–S phase compared to 5% H2/N2 activation gas. The reason is attributed that in pure hydrogen atmosphere, the sulfur on the Co–Mo–S edge can be more easily hydrogenated to form the SH groups. The formation of SH groups promotes the electron transfer from Co to Mo through sulfur atoms and enhances the anchoring of Co to MoS2, therefore stabilizing the Co–Mo–S phase [35]. Furthermore, the formation of SH groups also leads to a low sulfur-covered Co–Mo–S edge and a significant increase in coordinatively unsaturated site (CUS). The abundant CUS provides more Lewis acidity site, thus enhancing CO adsorption and improving the catalyst activity [36]. Consequently, the catalyst activated in pure H2 shows higher activity, especially the C2+OH selectivity toward the higher alcohols synthesis. The work provides some new insights for the preparation and activation mechanism of Mo-based catalysts for the higher alcohol synthesis."
10,Conclusions,"We synthesized a nanosheets structured K–Co–MoS2 by a one-step hydrothermal synthesis combined with the wetness impregnation. The fresh catalyst has a high dispersion of Co–Mo–S active phase and No Co9S8 is found. The pure H2 activation before reaction suppresses maximally the formation of Co9S8 and stabilizes the Co–Mo–S active phase during the reaction, thus showing a high intrinsic activity for the higher alcohol synthesis. It is suggested that the pure H2 atmosphere is favorable to hydrogenate the sulfur on the Co–Mo–S to form SH groups, which promotes the electron transfer from Co to Mo and thus stabilizes the Co–Mo–S active phase."
