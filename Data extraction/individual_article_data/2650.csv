0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a good energy carrier and is well considered as a substitute to the fossil fuels due to its high energy content and non-polluting nature during combustion. In recent years, fermentative hydrogen production is given more attention than other biological production methods like photofermentation and biophotolysis due to its less-energy requirement and higher volumetric hydrogen production rate (HPR) [1]. There are many factors affecting the usage of dark fermentative biohydrogen production for energy purpose, such as feedstock availability, feedstock amount, feedstock cost, reactor configuration, reactor operation mode and hydrogen conversion rate. Organic wastes/wastewaters are ideal feedstock for green bioenergy production due to having both environment protection and energy production advantages. Most investigations on continuous hydrogen production from industrial wastewaters have been conducted in continuously stirred-tank reactors (CSTRs) [1]. Nevertheless, bacterial cells washout under short hydraulic retention time (HRT) is a major problem associated with the CSTR, that leads to the process instability and inefficient hydrogen production [2]. To overcome this drawback of CSTRs, immobilization technologies have been extensively researched in the last decade [3]. Immobilized cells reactors are able to retain high cell mass concentration under shorter HRT, and capable of improving the operational stability and production rates of hydrogen fermentation [3]. Immobilization techniques applied in hydrogen production are generally categorized as surface attachment (biomass attached to the surface of the solid support matrix and induced biofilm formation), entrapment (biomass enclosed within a porous matrix) and self-aggregation (biofilm formation and granulation by self flocculation of biomass or addition of cross linking agents). Among them, entrapment is widely used due to its ability to retain higher cell mass concentration at shorter HRT and providing anaerobic condition to the microorganisms in the carrier material [4]. Nonetheless, mass transfer limitation do occur in the entrapment method [5]. Some strategies have been adopted to improve the cell biomass concentration and hydrogen production performance in continuous hydrogen production systems: rapid granulation formation by intermittent pH change [6], addition of carrier materials (such as activated carbon [7] and plastic carrier support [8]), entrapped immobilized cells [4] and self-granulation [9]. The entrapped immobilized cells were successfully employed in various hydrogen producing bioreactors such as column bioreactor [10], CSTR [11], fluidized-bed [12] and draft-tube [13]. The HPRs have been reported to vary from 2.1L/L-d to 368.6L/L-d with respect to the type of feedstock, carrier material and reactor operational conditions [14,15]. Immobilized beads preparation has been reported to affect hydrogen production and microbial community structure due to toxicity of the chemicals used in preparation steps [16]. We recently used a newly developed hybrid immobilized-material (HY-IM) as an entrapment carrier material for hydrogen-producing bacteria and showed stable hydrogen production up to ten-repeated batch cycle operations [17]. In addition, the performances of the immobilized beads were not affected due to non-toxic polymers used in the preparation steps. However, for further application of the HY-IM, it is necessary to examine its stability and durability via long-term operations in a continuous system. Thus, the present study reports the operational stability (over 175days) of the HY-IM for continuous hydrogen production from beverage industry wastewater (BWW) by entrapping hydrogen-producing mixed culture. The effects of HRT and the corresponding changes in microbial communities were also investigated, in addition to total energy analysis and its application in a model beverage industry."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Enrichment of hydrogen producing mixed cultures,"2.1 Enrichment of hydrogen producing mixed cultures Heat-treated compost (80°C for 30min) was employed to enrich the stable hydrogen producing microbial community from sucrose. Enrichment experiments were carried out in serum vials (125mL) with a working volume of 50mL under strict anaerobic condition. The PYS medium contained the following nutrients (g/L): peptone, 10; yeast extract, 10; resazurin, 0.001; l-cysteine-HCl, 0.5; sucrose, 10. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.0. Five successive transfers in PYS medium with 24h grown mixed culture as inoculum (10%) were done to obtain the mixed-culture. The developed culture was stored at 4°C."
3,Immobilized cells preparation and wastewater composition,"2.2 Immobilized cells preparation and wastewater composition The immobilized cells were prepared by adding the pellet biomass of freshly (24h) grown enriched mixed culture. The prepared cell suspension was mixed with a mild constant stirring in sodium-alginate (2%), activated carbon (2%), woko gel (2%) and chitosan (2%) for the entrapment and encapsulation. The alginate-cell mixture was extruded into sterile calcium chloride solution (0.2M) for cell entrapment in alginate beads. The beads formed (5–6mm) were further hardened by stirring the beads in a fresh solution of calcium chloride (0.2M) for two more hours. Finally, the beads were washed thrice with sterile distilled water and dried and then stored in a refrigerator until being used in the experiments [17]. The characteristics of the BWW were pH 2.6–3.4, chemical oxygen demand (COD) 760–900g/L and total reducing-sugar 660–750g(hexose equivalent)/L."
4,Operation of immobilized-cells CSTR,"2.3 Operation of immobilized-cells CSTR The entrapped immobilized cells (10% w/v) were packed in a CSTR having internal compartments (Fig. 1 ). The total volume of the immobilized-cells CSTR was 1.0L with a working volume of 0.56L. The reactor was agitated with a magnetic stirrer at a rotation speed of 60rpm. The reactor was initially operated in a batch mode for 24h to allow the growth of cell biomass, and then switched to a continuous mode with an HRT of 8h. The HRT was gradually reduced (after the reactor reached a steady-state condition) to 1.5h. The BWW substrate concentration was 20g total reducing-sugar(hexose equivalent)/L. The reactor was operated at a temperature of 37°C without any pH control. The basal medium used was followed from the Endo formulation [18] and contained the following ingredients (g/L): NH4CO3, 5.24; NaHCO3, 6.72; K2HPO4, 0.125; MgCl2⋅6H2O, 0.1; MnSO4⋅6H2O, 0.015; FeSO4⋅7H2O, 0.025; CuSO4⋅5H2O, 0.005; CoCl2⋅5H2O, 0.00012."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The biogas volume was measured using a wet-gas meter (Ritter, Bochum, Germany). The hydrogen production efficiency was evaluated using the hydrogen content in biogas, hydrogen yield (HY) and hydrogen production rate (HPR). Biogas composition (H2 and CO2) was analyzed with a gas chromatograph having a thermal conductivity detector (China Chromatograph 8700T). The effluent samples were used to measure the soluble metabolic products (SMP), volatile suspended solids (VSS) and COD using the methods described elsewhere [19]. Hydrogen yield was computed as mol-H2 /mol hexose."
6,Microbial community analysis and scanning electron microscopy,"2.5 Microbial community analysis and scanning electron microscopy The hydrogen-producing microbial communities at various HRTs were monitored by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) technique. The PCR amplification and DGGE analysis were followed as per the method described in our previous study [20]. For scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, the bacterial suspension was filtered through a 0.47μm membrane and washed with phosphate saline buffer (pH 7.3) and immersed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde buffer solution for 2–3h for bacterial cell fixation followed by a series of dehydration process with graded ethanol (30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, 95% and absolute ethanol) for 30min each. The dehydrated cells were dried and sputter coated with platinum and subjected to SEM (HITACHI, S3000H) analysis."
7,Results and discussions,
8,Reactor performance under various HRTs,"3.1 Reactor performance under various HRTs HRT is an important operating parameter that influences the hydrogen production rate and operational stability of a biohydrogen-producing reactor. Keeping constant substrate concentration and decreasing HRT are efficient strategies to avoid substrate inhibition, washout of non-hydrogen-producing bacteria, and development of a stable hydrogen-producing microbial community in a continuous fermentative hydrogen production system [1]. As shown in Table 1 , the BWW substrate concentration was kept constant at 20g/Lhexose equivalent, while the organic loading rate (OLR) was increased from 60 to 320g/L-dhexose equivalent by a gradual decrease in HRT from 8h to 1.5h. Fig. 2 shows the profiles of biogas production rate (BPR), HPR, HY, pH, H2 (%) and CO2 (%) at various HRTs during the continuous operation. The performances of the reactor under steady-state conditions at each applied HRT are summarized in Table 1. A stable hydrogen production was noted after two days post switching from the batch mode to continuous operation. Similar start-up time was also reported by Guo et al. [21] using glucose substrate in a continuous operation with l-cysteine addition. In the present study, immobilization of bacterial cells might have provided a suitable anaerobic environment similar to l-cysteine, and probably served to reduce the start-up time. After the start-up period, the HPR gradually increased from 2.16L/L-d (batch operation) and stabilized to 12.9L/L-d at 8h HRT (Fig. 2). On further step-wise shortening of HRT from 8h to 1.5h with corresponding OLRs of 60 to 320g substrate/L-dhexose equivalent, the HPR was found to gradually increase from 12.9L/L-d (HRT 8h) to a peak value of 55.4L/L-d (HRT 1.5h). Experimental results clearly show that HRT significantly affected the hydrogen production performance. The observed increase in HPR as a result of shortening HRT might be attributed to the efficient immobilized cells with better ability to sustain high OLR. The maximum HPR (55.4L/L-d at 320g/L-dhexose equivalent and 1.5h HRT) obtained in this work is quite higher than an earlier reported value of 7.6L/L-d at 1920g COD/L-d and 0.5h HRT [22] using condensed molasses solubles substrate. Hydrogen content in the biogas varied from 43.7% to 47.1%. The maximum HY of 1.7mol H2/mol hexose was achieved at 6h HRT, but at 1.5h HRT the HY dropped to 1.50molH2/mol hexose. Previous reports [15,22] also shown that shortening HRT elevated the HPR and lowered the HY, probably due to the washout of hydrogen-producing bacteria under short retention time. During the entire operation period in our study, no external alkali-chemicals were added to control the pH. Without any pH control during the entire operation the pH fluctuated between 5.6 and 6.3 indicating a well-buffered system capable of resisting severe pH changes (if any) during hydrogen fermentation. The maximum HPR (55.4L/L-d) from BWW obtained in the present study was quite higher than other reported values using pure substrates and wastewater feedstock by an entrapped immobilized cells reactor (Table 2 ) except the value of 368.6L/L-d achieved by Wu et al. [15]. The difference might be mainly attributed to the use of sucrose substrate by Wu et al. [15] and granular sludge formation apart from variation in the type of inoculum, carrier material, reactor type, and operational conditions (pH, OLR, HRT, and temperature). Fig. 3 shows the HPR obtained from the wastewater feedstock employed in fermentative hydrogen production [22,25,26,27,28]. A maximum HPR of 34L/L-d was obtained from corn-syrup waste in a novel biohydrogen reactor with a gravity settler [27]. However, it is also indicated that the reactor was operated at moderately high HRT of 8h and low OLR of 81g COD/L-d when compared to 1.5h HRT and high OLR of 320g/L-dhexose equivalent in this study. Thus, the present work demonstrated superior performance of handling high OLR at low HRT (1.5h) and showed an enhanced hydrogen production performance from BWW. This is to authors’ knowledge, the first ever reported high-rate hydrogen production (55L/L-d) from real wastewaters in dark fermentative hydrogen production. As indicated by Lin et al. [1] in a continuous hydrogen production from wastewaters, the HPR values were much lower than 10L/L-d; this major variation might be attributed to the high COD nature of the feedstock, lack of fermentable sugars, and/or co-existence of hydrogen-consuming bacteria."
9,Effect of HRT on soluble metabolites distribution,"3.2 Effect of HRT on soluble metabolites distribution Table 1 summarizes the concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs; butyrate, acetate, lactate and formate) and solvents (ethanol and butanol) at various HRTs. The VFA concentrations did not vary significantly (in the range of 15.8 to 17.08g COD/L) as HRT was decreased from 8h to 1.5h. On the other hand, the solvent concentrations were largely affected by the HRT shifts with values varying from 3.4g COD/L at HRT 3h to 1.4g COD/L at HRT 1.5h. Fig. 4 illustrates the percentage distribution of soluble metabolites over the HRT variation. The percentage of butyrate concentration reduced from 59.9% at HRT 8h to 46.9% at HRT 1.5h. Acetate and ethanol concentrations were relatively higher at moderate HRTs whereas lactate concentration increased from 1.5% at HRT 8h to 19.3% at HRT 1.5h. The fraction percentages of propionate and butanol concentrations were less than 5% indicating an efficient hydrogen production process because the formation of propionate and butanol consumes hydrogen. Formate concentration remained below 0.9% irrespective of the HRT shifts. The soluble metabolites profile obtained in this study indicates a mixed-type fermentation of BWW. (1) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 4 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COO - + 2 HCO 3 - + 4 H + + 4 H 2 Δ G O ′ = - 206.0 kJ / mol (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COO - + 2 HCO 3 - + 3 H + + 2 H 2 Δ G O ′ = - 254.0 kJ / mol (3) CH 3 CHOHCOO - + 0.4 CH 3 COO - + 0.7 H + → 0.7 CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COO - + 0.6 H 2 + CO 2 + 0.4 H 2 O Δ G O ′ = - 183.9 kJ / mol (4) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 CH 2 OH + 2 HCO 3 - + 2 H 2 Δ G O ′ = - 235.0 kJ / mol In anaerobic fermentation, a distribution pattern of VFAs and alcohols reflects the metabolism of hydrogen-producing microorganisms [29,30]. The butyrate and acetate production (Eqs. (1) and (2)) and their conversion ratios have been considered as effective indicators to assess the performances of dark fermentative hydrogen production under continuous operation [31]. The butyrate to acetate concentration ratios were in the range of 0.65 to 1.0. This ratio value was found to strongly correlate with HY in the HRT range of 6h to 1.5h, indicating a significant role of butyrate to acetate concentration ratio on the HY. In other words, lower concentration ratio of butyrate to acetate associated with higher HY as also reported by another study [32]. Increased lactate production from 0.27g COD/L to 3.43g COD/L significantly affected the hydrogen yield (HY) but not HPR. A similar phenomenon was reported by Kim et al. [33] where a lactate concentration of 10g COD/L affected HY but not HPR. In fact, under mixed acidogenic fermentation (Eq. (3)), apart from the substrate, acetate and lactate can also be used to produce hydrogen, CO2 and butyrate by some Clostridium spp. under short HRT [34]. Ethanol concentration (Eq. (4)) varied from 1.24g COD/L (HRT 1.5h) to 2.65g COD/L (HRT 4h) which result is quite similar to a study using molasses [35]. The association of higher production of lactate and ethanol under higher OLR observed in this study was consistent with the findings of some studies [36,37]. Table 3 summarizes the COD mass balance at steady-state conditions under different HRTs based on the distribution of soluble metabolites, cell biomass, and hydrogen. The closure of COD balance at 96–101% indicates the accuracy of the experimental data and correct interpretation of the reactor performance. The limited variation of less than 4% in the COD recovery could be due to the marginal error of the determination methods used [38]."
10,Microbial structure and morphology changes,"3.3 Microbial structure and morphology changes PCR–DGGE analyses provides valuable information on overall diversity and changes in microbial community structure, and is also helpful in determining their corresponding role in a continuous hydrogen production [39]. Fig. 5 shows the DGGE profiles of the bacterial communities under steady-state conditions of applied HRTs. Table 4 lists the DGGE band sequence affiliations. The bacterial communities prevailing at different HRTs were mainly composed of eight groups of bacteria namely Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Clostridium celerecrescens, Clostridium pasteurianum, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Klebsiella oxytoca, Selenomonas lacticifex and Clostridium perfringens. At an HRT of 1.5h with peak HPR of 55.44L/L-d, these six species of Clostridium genus were dominant. K. oxytoca and S. lacticifex did not appear at HRT 1.5h. K. oxytoca (band 8) appeared at HRT 4h but disappeared with shortening HRT. A study [39] also reported a similar dynamics of K. oxytoca with HRT shifts. The higher ethanol concentration (2.6g COD/L) at HRT 4h could be associated with the presence of Klebsiella species that are known for hydrogen production and excretion of ethanol and acetate [40]. Selenomonas lacticifex appeared in the reactor at HRTs 3h and 2h but disappeared at HRT 1.5h. The difference in cell biomass concentrations at HRT 3h (6.3gVSS/L) and 1.5h (3.5gVSS/L) might be due to the population dynamics of the self-flocculating and granule forming Selenomonas spp. as previously reported [41]. Selenomonas spp. are non-spore forming bacteria that produces lactate, propionate and acetate [42]. They have been detected in hydrogen producing reactors with continuous operation [43,44]. At the OLR of 160g/L-dhexose equivalent, S. lacticifex appeared in the reactor; but high OLR of 320g/L-dhexose equivalent led to its disappearance with a subsequent drop in HY from 1.66 to 1.50mol/mol hexose and a subsequent increase in HPR from 36.01 to 55.44L/L-d (Table 1). A similar effect of OLR was also reported by Luo et al. [44] where the appearance of Selenomonas spp. in a CSTR at low OLR improved the HY; whereas the disappearance of Selenomonas spp. at high OLR improved the HPR but gave a drop in HY. The Clostridium spp. (C. butyricum, C. tyrobutyricum, C. celerecrescens, C. pasteurianum and C. acetobutylicum) detected in our study have been reported as potential hydrogen-producing bacteria in continuous operations [4,34,39,44]. The DGGE analysis clearly showed that HRT significantly affected the composition of microbial community structure in continuous hydrogen production. The cell biomass concentration was in the range of 2.8–6.3gVSS/L (Table 1). The peak cell biomass concentration was 6.3gVSS/L at HRT 3h but drastically reduced to 3.5gVSS/L at HRT 1.5h. The cell biomass concentration (2.8–6.3gVSS/L) obtained in this study was much lower than that of a previous study [45], probably due to the washout of self-flocculating bacteria under short HRT, although this did not significantly affect the HPR. It has been shown that even with a low cell biomass concentration of 0.49gVSS/L the HPR could also reach 6.82L/L/h in an UASB reactor fed with xylose [46]. The appearance of granular cell biomass with its increased concentration at HRT 3h in the present study indicates the presence of self-flocculating granule forming bacteria (Selenomonas sp.); moreover, the results that granular structure changed and cell biomass concentration reduced at HRT 1.5h could be due to the absence of Selenomonas sp., as evident from DGGE analyses. However, the formation of granules in hydrogen-producing reactors is unpredictable and cannot be associated often with short HRTs. As evident from earlier reports [39] the self-flocculated granules formed at short HRTs with the appearance of specialized bacterial species (e.g. C. pasteurianum and Streptococcus sp.) with a high cell biomass concentration of 79.4gVSS/L. In contrary, there is a report [22] indicating with silicone immobilized cells in a CSTR fed with condensed molasses solubles did not have any granular sludge formation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 6 ) illustrate the appearance of the bacterial distribution at various stages of immobilized cells reactor operation. Fig. 6 shows the structure of the immobilized cells before and after fermentation. As shown in Fig. 6b, the porous nature was seen in the immobilized cells which provided a better mass transfer between the substrates and bacterial cells, and also acted as a reservoir of bacterial cells. Even at the shortest HRT (1.5h) the bacterial cell biomass was retained in the immobilized carrier and provided the operational stability of the reactor. The suspended cells have the appearance of uniform rod-like bacterial cells (Fig. 6c). The morphology of the granular cell biomass is shown in Fig. 6d and e. The granular layer mostly comprised of bacilli and cocci shaped bacteria."
11,Energy production rate,"3.4 Energy production rate The energy production rate (EPR) at various HRTs was calculated based on the higher heat combustion value of hydrogen and ethanol. As shown in Table 5 , peak EPR of 641kJ/L-d was obtained at HRT 1.5h. The highest ethanol production rate was obtained at HRT 4h and dropped upon further shortening of HRT. The EPR obtained in this study was quite higher than a value (372kJ/L-d) obtained from an ethanol-type fermentation using molasses [35]. This suggests that beverage wastewater is a high energy yielding feedstock capable of producing both hydrogen and ethanol. To demonstrate the application of BWW to hydrogen production in electricity generation and CO2 emission reduction by our process, we selected the Mainland China’s coco-cola manufacturing unit [48] as a model to calculate the onsite energy production. Table 6 shows the bioenergy generation and CO2 emission reduction from fermentation of BWW. As indicated in Table 6, the volume of hydrogen production was 5500m3-d, which is equivalent to 216,025mol/d (i.e., 9001mol/h). This hydrogen can generate 9024kW-d electricity (at 50% conversion efficiency) when a fuel cell is used with an annual electricity generation rate of 3293MWh. Furthermore, the electricity generation of 3293MWh from the bioenergy process is expected to replace 24% of the total electricity consumption (13,847MWh) for the coco-cola manufacturing unit, and could reduce the carbon dioxide emission of 2,832 ton CO2 equivalents/yr for coal-based power plant (IEA., 2012) [49]."
12,Significance of the experimental data,"3.5 Significance of the experimental data According to the experimental results, immobilized cells operation is suitable for efficient hydrogen production from beverage wastewater. Hybrid immobilized-bacterial cells show stable operation over 175days. Furthermore, addition of selectively enriched culture in the immobilized carrier significantly reduces the start-up time of the reactor and achieves a stable hydrogen production after two days of reactor operation. Other reports also reveal that enriched mixed culture addition leads to reducing start-up time and improving operational stability of a bioreactor for continuous hydrogen production, due to the selective population of efficient hydrogen-producing bacteria [50,51]. Among the various entrapped immobilized cells applied on continuous hydrogen production, glucose and sucrose were widely studied substrates, while few studies use wastewaters as a feedstock for hydrogen production (Table 2). The reported HPR values of pure substrates were 8.6 to 369L/L-d, whereas for wastewater was 2.1 to 8.7L/L-d. It is noted that HRT and OLR are the important parameters in continuous hydrogen production. Usually, short HRT with high OLR is favorable for higher hydrogen production rate [15,22]. The immobilized cells reactor fed with BWW gave an optimal hydrogen production rate (55.4L/L-d) at a high OLR of 320g/Lhexose equivalent than that of other tested OLRs. Therefore, it is important to maintain the proper OLR to obtain an efficient hydrogen production. The microbial community analysis demonstrated the dominance of Clostridium sp., throughout the experimental conditions which resulted in efficient hydrogen production from BWW. The granular sludge formation was observed under low HRTs (2–3h), while further lowering of HRT to 1.5h resulted in the disappearance of granular cell biomass in the reactor, probably due to the washout of self-flocculating bacteria (Selenomonas sp). Many reports [15,39,52] indicate that successful granular sludge formation under HRT less than 4h high hydrogen production rate and yield were obtained with pure substrate (glucose, starch and sucrose). In the present study the granular sludge was affected at low HRT of 1.5h which significantly reduced the HY but not the HPR; this is quite similar to a report [22] using immobilized cells system with condensed molasses solubles. The application of immobilized cells to retain the hydrogen-producing bacteria at low HRTs would be an appropriate strategy for efficient and cost effective sustainable hydrogen production from industrial wastewaters."
13,Conclusions,"As demonstrated in this study HRT plays a crucial role in (1) determining the efficiency of hydrogen production and (2) forming granule in immobilized cells reactors with continuous operation from BWW. At HRT 1.5h the maximum HPR of 55L/L-d was obtained, while at HRT 3h the maximum cell biomass concentration was achieved due to the presence of self-flocculating Selenomonas sp. Even at HRT 1.5h, the immobilized beads could act as a reservoir for retaining the bacterial cells inside the carrier, thus showing an improvement in hydrogen production and operational stability of the reactor. The energy production rate (641kJ/L-d) confirmed the efficiency of the process and shows BWW is a feasible feedstock for sustainable hydrogen production with high energy yield. Furthermore, the BWW to hydrogen production process is capable of replacing 24% of electricity consumption in a model beverage industry, apart from 2,832 ton CO2 reduction annually."
