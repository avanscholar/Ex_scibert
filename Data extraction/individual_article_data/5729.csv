0,Introduction,"Aerogels have immense prospects as oil sorbents (Feng, Nguyen, Fan, & Duong, 2015; Liu, Geng, Chen, & Wang, 2017; Yang, Chen, Mu, Hao, & Ma, 2015; Yang, Zhang et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015), waste-treatment materials (Gao, Huang, Zhang, Wu, & Li, 2017; Yu et al., 2017), and as materials for biological tissue engineering (Cai et al., 2014; Naseri et al., 2016; Si et al., 2016), energy storage (Yang, Zhang et al., 2015; Yang, Chen et al., 2015), and thermal insulation (Cuce, Cuce, Wood, & Riffat, 2014; Han, Zhang, Wu, & Lu, 2015; Rudaz et al., 2014; Wicklein et al., 2015), because of their extraordinarily physical properties including high porosity, ultra-low density, ultra-high specific surface area, and low thermal conductivity. However, the commonly used inorganic silica aerogels exhibit very poor mechanical properties. Recently, a large number of bio-based and petroleum-based composite aerogels containing cellulose (He et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2017), poly(furfuryl alcohol) (Wang, Sun, Long, Wang, & Schiraldi, 2016), polyaniline (Zhao, Chen, & Chen, 2017), chitosan (Zhao et al., 2016), alginate (Shang et al., 2016), polyimide (Nguyen et al., 2016), polyrotaxane (Jiang, Kato, Mayumi, Yokoyama, & Ito, 2017), and epoxy (Arndt, Gawryla, & Schiraldi, 2007) have been fabricated. Inorganic/organic composite aerogels have been rapidly developed to realize mechanical strength higher than those of inorganic aerogels. The poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) aerogel has been considered a promising substitute for conventional foams because of its relatively low cost, biodegradability, and low thermal conductivity (Chen, Wang, & Schiraldi, 2014; Chen, Hollinger, Wang, & Schiraldi, 2014; Chen, Liu et al., 2014; Liu, Medina, & Berglund, 2017; Shang, Yang et al., 2017; Shang, Ye et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2015). However, the low mechanical strength and easy flammability of the aerogels limit its potential applications. PVA/montmorillonite (MMT) and PVA/laponite nanocomposite aerogels exhibit improved compressive modulus, and their heat and smoke release rates are significantly lower than those of commercial polystyrene foams (Chen, Hollinger et al., 2014). Therefore, highly flame-retardant PVA-based aerogels are extremely promising for automobile interiors, insulating foams, and packaging. PVA composite aerogels exhibit excellent flame retardant by adding a variety of halogen-free flame retardants. Wang et al. (2015) incorporated ammonium polyphosphate modified by piperazine (PA-APP) in PVA/MMT aerogels to enhance the flame retardancy and mechanical properties of the aerogels. Furthermore, to improve the mechanical properties of the PVA-based aerogels, different crosslinking methods such as irradiation crosslinking (Chen et al., 2015), were used, and crosslinking agents such as divinylsulfone (Chen, Liu et al., 2014), borate (Shang, Yang et al., 2017; Shang, Ye et al., 2017), aldehydes (Bryant, Noble, & Koval, 1997), tetraethoxysilane (Uragami, Okazaki, Matsugi, & Miyata, 2002), and gelation (Wang et al., 2017) were added to the aerogels. The crosslinking of the PVA/MMT composite aerogels using borax not only enhanced the compressive property but also improved flame retardancy (Shang, Yang et al., 2017; Shang, Ye et al., 2017). The crosslinked PVA/MMT with gelatin composite aerogels exhibited a kind of co-continuous network microstructure, which could improve the compressive property of the resulting aerogels and increase the limiting oxygen index (LOI) value (Wang et al., 2017). Although the PVA-based composite aerogels exhibit enhanced flame retardancy and compressive properties than the pure PVA aerogels, the mechanical properties and flame retardancy of the composite aerogels are still limited in order for them to successfully substitution high-performance foam materials. Alginate, as a kind of natural polysaccharide, is an inherently flame-retardant biomaterial. A kind of nonflammable alginate/MMT nanocomposite aerogels was prepared by post-crosslinking, and the crosslinked alginate/MMT aerogels exhibited excellent flame retardancy with LOI > 60% and enhanced compressive strength (Shang et al., 2016). Additionally, the cause of death in fire hazard is not only heat, but also the toxicity of smoke. Most deaths in a fire hazard are mainly owing to smoke toxicity, which is caused by the inhalation of toxic smoke and coma. The main components of smoke include toxic gaseous decomposition products and many tiny solid particles. Therefore, low smoke toxicity of materials can effectively improve the chances of surviving a fire. The bottleneck in the development of advanced flame-retardant materials is to simultaneously realize excellent mechanical properties and high flame retardancy and no smoke toxicity. In this study, we prepared PVA/alginate/MMT composite aerogels by a green freeze-drying method and proposed a new “two-step” crosslinking approach to simultaneously enhance the fire safety and mechanical properties of PVA/alginate composite aerogels. The thermal stability of the PVA/alginate/MMT composite aerogels was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and the flammability of the PVA-based aerogels was evaluated by LOI and vertical burning and cone calorimeter tests. Finally, the flame-retardancy mechanisms of the PVA/alginate/MMT composite aerogels were systematically investigated."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA-1750, M w ¯ = 75000–80000) were supplied from Shanghai Epi Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Sodium montmorillonite (MMT) was produced from Shijiazhuang Lingshou Fengheng Mine Product Processing Plant (China). Sodium alginate (A) was purchased from Tianjin Zhiyuan Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (China). Boric acid (BA) was purchased from Tianjin Hengxing Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (China). Calcium chloride (CaCl2) was purchased from Laiyang Economic and Technological Development Zone Fine Chemical Factory (China). Ethyl alcohol was purchased from Tianjin Bohuatong Chemical Factory (China)."
3,Preparation of PVA/alginate/MMT aerogels,"2.2 Preparation of PVA/alginate/MMT aerogels 4 g PVA was dissolved in 100 mL deionized water at 85 °C under vigorously stirring for 2 h to prepare a PVA solution (4 wt%), following which 4 g of MMT and 4 g of sodium alginate were slowly added to 100 mL of the 4 wt% PVA solution stirred at 2000 rpm and continued for 2 h at 85 °C to obtain a uniform PVA/alginate/MMT composite hydrogel. The hydrogel was poured into a mold, and rapidly frozen in liquid N2. Finally, the sample was dried in a freeze-dryer (FD-1A-50 type, Boyikang Co. Ltd., China) at −55 °C and 10 Pa for 48 h. P, A, and M represent PVA, alginate, and MMT, respectively, and the numbers denote their corresponding relative weight content in wt% in deionized water. The product is referred to as P4A4M4 aerogel."
4,Preparation of crosslinked P4A4M4 aerogel,"2.3 Preparation of crosslinked P4A4M4 aerogel The pH value of the P4A4M4 hydrogel (80 g) was adjusted to 11 using ammonia water at 25 °C, following which 2 mL 0.05 M boric acid solution was added dropwise, manually stirred for 5 s and rapidly poured into a mold and stood for 2 h at room temperature. After that, the obtained hydrogel was frozen in liquid nitrogen and freeze-dried at −55 °C and 10 Pa for 48 h. This crosslinked sample was named P4A4M4/BA aerogel, where BA referred to borate ions as the crosslinking agent. The obtained P4A4M4 aerogel was immersed in a saturated CaCl2/ethanol solution for 6 h at room temperature to make it crosslink completely. Then, it was dried in a vacuum oven (0.1 × 104 Pa) at 60 °C for 12 h to remove ethanol. The crosslinked P4A4M4 aerogel with calcium chloride was named as P4A4M4/Ca, where Ca referred to calcium chloride as the crosslinking agent. The two-step crosslinked P4A4M4 composite aerogel was prepared by the pre-crosslinking of boric acid and post-crosslinking of calcium chloride, and it was named P4A4M4/BA/Ca aerogel. The theoretical element contents of B and Ca in the aerogel were calculated as 1.08 × 10 −2 wt% and 3.1 wt%, respectively. The relatively element content of Ca in the P4A4M4/BA/Ca aerogel was 3.8 wt% (see in Table S1, Supplementary data), however, the relatively element content of B was very low to be detected by SEM-EDS measurement. The preparation process of the crosslinked PVA/alginate/MMT composite aerogels is illustrated in Scheme 1 ."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The apparent density of the PVA-based aerogels was calculated by measuring the weight and dimension data using digital calipers and analytical balances. Compressive property was measured on the cylindrical specimens by using a universal testing machine (Zwick Z020, Germany) with a 5 kN load cell at 10 mm/min. The dimension of the cylindrical specimens was ˜2 cm in diameter and height. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was conducted on a Vertex 70 spectrometer (Brucker, Germany) using a KBr disk in the wavenumber range of 4000–400 cm −1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of the aerogels were performed using an XRD instrument (D/Max-2500 type, Japan Science Co.) in a 2θ range from 4 to 60° at scanning a speed of 3°/min. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried on a TGA Q500 (TA Instruments, Germany) thermogravimetric analyzer. The samples were heated from 25 to 700 °C at 10 °C /min under N2 flow of 40 mL/min. The LOI values were measured on an oxygen-index meter (HC-2C type, Jiangning Analysis Instrument Co., China) according to ASTM D2863-2009. The dimensions of all samples were 120 × 10 × 10 mm3. The UL-94 vertical burning test was conducted on an instrument (CZF-2 type, Jiangning Analysis Instrument Co., China) according to ASTM D3801-2010. The dimensions of all samples were 125 × 10 × 10 mm3. Cone calorimeter test was conducted on a cone calorimeter (Fire Testing Technology, U. K.) according ASTM E1354/ISO 5660. The specimen with dimensions of 100 × 100 × 10 mm3 was wrapped in an aluminum foil and exposed at a heat flux of 50 kW/m2. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SM-6700 F, Japan Electronics Corp.) was used to observe the morphology of the aerogels and char residues (CRs) after the cone calorimeter test. The samples were cyrofractured in a liquid nitrogen and coated with a conductive platinum layer before imaging. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy apparatus (EDS, INCA type, British Oxford Instrument Co.) was conducted to measure the surface relative elemental compositions of the char layer after the cone calorimeter test."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Structure characterization of the aerogels,"3.1 Structure characterization of the aerogels The effect of crosslinking on the microstructure of the PVA-based composite aerogels was investigated. FT-IR spectra of the PVA-based aerogels and BA are shown in Fig. 1 (a). Compared to the PVA aerogel, the peaks at 3298, 1713, and 1255 cm−1 of the P4A4M4 aerogel became weaker and broader, which was ascribed to intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between the hydroxyl groups (−OH) and unreacted ester groups of PVA and the hydroxyl groups (−OH) of sodium alginate. In case of the P4A4M4/BA composite aerogel, the peak intensity at 3298 cm−1 increased, and the peak of δOH at 1647 cm−1 shifted to 1623 cm−1 due to the crosslinking of borate ions with the hydroxyl groups of PVA and sodium alginate. After the post-crosslinking of the P4A4M4 aerogel using calcium chloride, the characteristic peaks of the P4A4M4/Ca composite aerogel at 2917 and 1373 cm−1 became weaker owing to the formation of an egg-box structure between alginate and Ca2+, which limited the stretching vibration of CH on the hexatomic ring. Further, the absorption at 1025 cm−1 due to the CO stretching vibration obviously decreased because of the formation of the COCaCO crosslinking structure (Kumar et al., 2017). Similarly, the intensity of the −OH stretching vibration at 3298 cm−1 on the six-membered ring also decreased due to the restricted stretching vibration. In case of the P4A4M4/BA/Ca aerogel, the −OH stretching vibration peak became wider and the peak at 3298 cm−1 shifted to 3450 cm−1. This is because the peaks of some hydroxyl groups associated with each other shifted to higher wavenumbers and overlapped with the peaks at low wavenumbers, thereby widening the peaks. The FT-IR results confirmed that the intermolecular interactions of the PVA/alginate/MMA aerogel were strengthened through pre-crosslinking with boric acid and post-crosslinking with calcium chloride. XRD patterns of the raw materials and PVA composite aerogels are shown in Fig. 1(b). For P4A4M4, the diffraction peak of PVA at 20.0° disappeared and that of MMT at 6.2° became smaller and broader. Meanwhile, the diffraction peaks of alginate at 19.0° and 38.4° disappeared while those at 28.3° and 49.1° shifted to 27.1° and 46.5°, respectively, which was ascribed to the hydrogen bonding interactions between alginate and PVA. Upon the crosslinking of borate ions, the peaks of PVA in the P4A4M4/BA aerogel shifted to lower angles from 27.1° and 32.6° to 26.9 and 32.3°, respectively. For the P4A4M4/Ca composite aerogel, nearly all the diffraction peaks disappeared, which implies that the ordered structure of PVA and alginate in the aerogel was destroyed by the post-crosslinking of Ca2+. For the P4A4M4/BA/Ca aerogel, the diffraction peaks still appeared because the microstructure of the P4A4M4/BA aerogel acquired by the first step crosslinking of borate ions was retained, and the diffraction peaks shifted from 27.1° and 32.3° of P4A4M4/BA to 27.5° and 32.8° by the post-crosslinking of Ca2+, respectively. The results indicated that the aggregation structure of the crosslinked PVA-based composite aerogels was changed due to the crosslinking action and hydrogen bonding interaction of different components. The proposed chemical crosslinking mechanisms of different PVA based composite aerogels is shown in Fig. 1(c). The morphology of the PVA based aerogels and element distribution by SEM-EDS were shown in Figs. 2 , S1 and Table S1 (Supplementary data). The P4A4M4 aerogel formed a three-dimensional network cell structure (Fig. 2(a) (a’)). Upon the crosslinking of B(OH)4 − with PVA and alginate, borate ions permeated into the network structure, thereby leading to the formation of a more uniform network cell structure (Han, Lei, & Wu, 2014; Kumar et al., 2017; Spoljaric, Salminen, Luong, & Seppälä, 2014). As a result, the cell density of the P4A4M4/BA aerogel (Fig. 2(b, b’)) increased and the cell size decreased. For the P4A4M4/Ca aerogel, the cell size slightly decreased compared to that of the P4A4M4 aerogel (Fig. 2(c)). In the 2 × 103 magnification micrograph in Fig. 2(c’), some block-like micro particles were observed to be adhered to the cell walls of the aerogels. Apparently, Ca2+ promoted the gelation of alginate and formed calcium alginate particles. For the P4A4M4/BA/Ca aerogel, the cell size decreased (Fig. 2(d)). In the 2 × 103 magnification micrograph in Fig. 2(d’), many micro and nanoparticles were attached to the cell wall, which acted as crosslinking points to reinforce the intermolecular interactions in the PVA composite aerogel. Thus, the enhanced intermolecular interaction is beneficial to increase the mechanical strength of aerogels. The distribution of Ca and B elements in the P4A4M4/BA/Ca aerogel is shown in Fig. 2(e) and (f). It can be seen that B and Ca are evenly distributed in P4A4M4/BA/Ca aerogel, and the content of Ca is much higher than that of B."
8,Mechanical properties of the aerogels,"3.2 Mechanical properties of the aerogels The physical properties of the PVA-based composite aerogels are summarized in Table S2 (Supplementary data). The densities of the P4A4M4 and P4A4M4/BA aerogels are 0.106 and 0.098 g/cm3, respectively. It is worth noting that the densities of the P4/A4/M4/Ca and P4/A4/M4/BA/Ca aerogels distinctly increased, which was attributed to the formation of a large amount of calcium alginate particles at the cell wall. Compared with the non-crosslinked P4A4M4 aerogel, the crosslinked PVA-based aerogels maintained their shapes during freeze-drying with slight volume shrinkage. Moreover, the mechanical properties of the PVA-based aerogels were compared, as shown in Fig. 3 . The compressive modulus and specific modulus of P4A4M4 dramatically increased to 2.1 MPa and 19.5 m2/s2, which were 6.0 and 5.7 times higher than those of the pure PVA aerogel, respectively. Upon crosslinking of borate ions, the compressive modulus and specific modulus of P4A4M4/BA aerogel increased to 4.6 MPa and 47.2 m2/s2, respectively. Following post-crosslinking with calcium ions, the compressive modulus and specific modulus of P4A4M4/Ca aerogel increased to 7.6 MPa and 32.5 m2/s2, with an increase of 2.6 and 0.7 times compared with those of P4A4M4 aerogel, respectively. In contrast, upon pre-crosslinking with borate ions and post-crosslinking with calcium ions, the compressive modulus and specific modulus of the P4A4M4/BA/Ca aerogel further increased to 17.3 MPa and 56.5 m2/s2, respectively, 7.2 and 1.9 times higher than those of P4A4M4 aerogel, respectively, which was ascribed to the incorporation of borate and calcium ions into the network, thus providing more physical crosslinking points for PVA-based aerogels. These results revealed that the compressive properties of the PVA/alginate/MMT aerogel are significantly enhanced after two-step crosslinking."
9,Thermal stability,"3.3 Thermal stability The thermal stability of the PVA-based aerogels was evaluated by TGA and differential thermogravimetry (DTG) (Fig. 4 (a) and (b)), respectively. The corresponding data are summarized in Table 1 . For the PVA aerogel, the onset thermal decomposition temperature (T 5%) at 5% weight loss was 250.7 °C. The main thermal weight loss between 300 to 400 °C was attributed to the decomposition of the hydroxyl groups in the PVA macromolecules and the yield of the final residue was only 4.4%. For the P4A4M4 aerogel, thermal decomposition temperature at maximum thermal weight loss rate (T max) decreased to 291.5 °C, and the residue yield increased to 56.0%. Upon crosslinking with borate ions or CaCl2, the T max of P4A4M4/BA and P4A4M4/Ca composite aerogels decreased to 280.6 and 273.6 °C, respectively, which were ascribed to the decomposition of hydroxyl groups from the composite aerogels. Following post-crosslinking of the aerogel with Ca2+, T5% for P4A4M4/Ca and P4A4M4/BA/Ca aerogels obviously decreased, and the maximum weight loss rates for P4A4M4/Ca and P4A4M4/BA/Ca aerogels significantly decreased from 5.8%/min for the P4A4M4 aerogel to 1.5%/min and 1.3%/min, respectively, and the corresponding residue yields increased to 68.0% and 69.4%, respectively. The incorporation of Ca2+ in P4A4M4 aerogel decreased the weight loss rates in second stage and increased the thermal stability due to the formed Ca2+ egg-shaped stable crosslinked complex structure (Fig. 1(c). This result demonstrates the two-step crosslinking strategy improved the char yield of the PVA/alginate/MMT composite aerogels."
10,Combustion behaviors,"3.4 Combustion behaviors The LOI values and the UL-94 vertical burning rating of the PVA-based aerogels are shown in Table 1. For the P4A4M4 aerogel, the LOI increased from 21.0% of pure P4 aerogel to 27.0%, and a UL-94 rating changed from no rating of P4 to V-0 rating. Upon the crosslinking of borate ions, the LOI of the P4A4M4/BA aerogel increased to 28.0%. For the crosslinked P4A4M4/Ca and P4A4M4/BA/Ca aerogels, the LOI values distinctly increased to 37.5% and 40.0%, respectively, which was because the intrinsically flame-retardant material, calcium alginate particles, acted as barriers on the cell wall to hinder the propagation of combustible gases and heat transfer. The combustion behaviors of the PVA composite aerogels were further investigated by cone calorimeter tests. The heat release rate (HRR) curves and total heat release (THR) are shown in Fig. 5 , and the cone calorimeter test data are listed in Table 2 . As shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), the HRR value of the pure PVA aerogel dramatically increased with time and a peak HRR (pHRR) of 202.2 kW/m2 at 39 s was achieved for a THR of 11.0 MJ/m2. For the P4A4M4 aerogel, the pHRR and THR values decreased dramatically to 94.0 kW/m2 and 10.3 MJ/m2, respectively. After crosslinking of borate or Ca2+ ions, the THR values for P4A4M4/BA and P4A4M4/Ca aerogels decreased to 6.5 and 7.5 MJ/m2, with the reduction of 36.9% and 27.2%, respectively, compared to those of the P4A4M4 aerogel. After two-step crosslinking, the pHRR and THR values of the P4A4M4/BA/Ca aerogel further decreased to 82.1 kW/m2 and 5.3 MJ/m2, with a reduction of 12.7% and 48.5%, respectively, compared to those of P4A4M4 aerogel. In addition, for the P4A4M4 aerogel, the time to ignition (TTI) was 6 s, whereas it prolonged to 14 s of the crosslinked P4A4M4/BA/Ca composite aerogel, and the time at the pHRR (TpHRR) was extended from 23 s of P4A4M4 aerogel to 98 s, which was because the small crosslinked cell structure and intrinsically flame-retardant calcium alginate particles distributed at the bubble wall more effectively slowed the diffusion of combustible gases. The results indicated that the two-step crosslinking of the P4A4M4 aerogel more effectively decreased the HRR and hindered the flame spread rate. The flame spread index (FGR) is the ratio of the pHRR of the materials to the corresponding time (t pHRR). A smaller FGR value implies a smaller flame spread rate and a lower fire hazard. Therefore, the FGR values represent the fire hazard safety. As shown in Table 2, the FGR value of the crosslinked P4A4M4/BA and P4A4M4/Ca composite aerogels reduced remarkably; especially, the P4A4M4/BA/Ca aerogel showed an FGR value of only 0.8 kW/m2·s, with a reduction of 80.5% compared to that of the P4A4M4 aerogel, thus demonstrating enhanced fire hazard safety. The specific extinction area (SEA) represents the smoke produced by the material per mass of the volatile unit. The smoke production rate (SPR), total smoke production (TSP), and SEA curves are shown in Fig. 5(c)–(e). PSPR and PSEA represent the peak values of the smoke production rate (SPR) and specific extinction area (SEA), respectively, and the corresponding data are listed in Table S3 (Supplementary data). The PSPR and PSEA values of the crosslinked P4A4M4 composite aerogels decreased compared to those of the P4A4M4 aerogels. The PSPR and PSEA values of P4A4M4/BA/Ca aerogel decreased further to 6 × 10−4 m2/s and 5.2 m2/kg, respectively. In addition, the peak values of CO (PCO) and CO2 (PCO2) production yields of the crosslinked P4A4M4/BA/Ca composite aerogels were obviously lower than those of the P4A4M4 aerogels. The total smoke release (TSR) values of the P4A4M4/BA and P4A4M4/Ca composite aerogels dramatically decreased to 11.1 and 8.0 m2 /m2, with a reduction of 48.6% and 63.0% compared to those of the P4A4M4 aerogel, respectively. In particular, the TSR value of the P4A4M4/BA/Ca composite aerogel further decreased to only 1.7 m2 /m2 with a reduction of 92.1% compared to that of P4A4M4 aerogel (21.6 m2 /m2), indicating its superior ability to suppress smoke toxicity. The results implied that the two-step crosslinked P4A4M4/BA/Ca aerogel more effectively suppresses the spread of toxic combustible gases during combustion."
11,Flame-retardancy mechanisms,"3.5 Flame-retardancy mechanisms The effective heat of combustion (ratio of THR and total mass loss, EHC = THR/TML) represents the combustion heat per unit gas mass. As shown in Table 2, the THR/TML values of the P4A4M4/BA and P4A4M4/Ca composite aerogels decreased from 1.59 MJ/m2·g for the P4A4M4 aerogel to 1.35 and 1.15 MJ/m2.g, respectively. After the two-step crosslinking, the THR/TML value of the P4A4M4/BA/Ca composite aerogel further decreased to 0.86 MJ/m2.g. The decrease in the THR/TML values could be attributed to the gaseous flame-retardant mechanism. From the aforementioned TGA results in Section 3.3, the crosslinked P4A4M4/BA/Ca composite aerogel exhibited an earlier thermogravimetric loss, and calcium alginate particles could produce H2O and CO2 through decarboxylation between 200 and 230 °C, which effectively reduced the concentration of combustible gas and insulate the entry of external air and the transfer of heat (Zhang et al., 2011). Thus, the gas-phase flame-retardancy effect of the P4A4M4/BA/Ca composite aerogel is more effective than that of other PVA-based aerogels. Fig. 5(f) illustrates the CR yield curves obtained via the cone calorimeter test. The CR yield value of the P4A4M4 aerogel was 50.0%. Upon crosslinking of borate ions, the CR yield of the P4A4M4/BA composite aerogel increased slightly to 50.5%. After crosslinking with Ca2+, the CR yields of P4A4M4/Ca and P4A4M4/BA/Ca aerogels increased to 68.9% and 73.5%, respectively, indicating that the incorporation of calcium ions was the main reason for the increase in the CR yield. The results confirmed that two-step crosslinking of the aerogel with borate and Ca2+ ions could effectively promote the carbonization reaction of the P4A4M4 composite aerogels. To further elucidate the effect of borate and Ca2+ crosslinking on the flame-retardancy mechanism of the PVA composite aerogels, digital photos of the residues of the PVA-based aerogels after the cone calorimeter tests are shown in Fig. 6 . The PVA aerogel produced a very small carbonized residue (Fig. 6(a)). The P4A4M4 aerogel formed a complete and compact char residue (Fig. 6(b)), and some fiber-like cracks were distributed at the surface of the residue. The crosslinked P4A4M4/BA aerogel presented a more compact char residue with small cracks (Fig. 6(c)). The P4A4M4/Ca aerogel exhibited some long cracks on the surface of the residue (Fig. 6(d)), which were attributed to the volume shrinkage of the aerogel during its combustion. In case of the P4A4M4/BA/Ca aerogel, a more uniform and compact char residue had formed (Fig. 6(e)). This result indicated that the two-step crosslinking of the aerogel promoted the formation of a denser char residue, which effectively prevented the flammable gases from diffusing further into the interior of the composite aerogel. Therefore, the highly efficient flame retardancy and low smoke toxicity of the crosslinked PVA composite aerogel were mainly ascribed to the condensed phase flame-retardant mechanism. To better understand the flame retardancy of the PVA composite aerogels, the surface morphology of the residues after the cone calorimeter test was observed by SEM (Fig. 7 (a–e)), and the corresponding chemical components of the residues at the surface of the PVA/alginate/MMT aerogels were determined by EDS analysis (Fig. 7(f) and Table S4, Supplementary data). For the PVA aerogels, the carbon residue presented a needle-like microstructure with a diameter of ˜0.5 μm and length of ˜5 μm (Fig. 7(a)), and the relative average content of C and O in the char residue at the surface were 21.6 At% and 78.4 At%, respectively. In the P4A4M4 aerogel, the residue formed a dense char layer, and particles with different sizes were distributed on the surface (Fig. 7(b)). The relative average contents of Na and Si elements in the char residue were 1.3 At% and 19.5 At%, respectively, and the average relative contents of C and O in the char residue at the surface decreased to 17.1 At% and 62.1 At%, respectively. Thus, these particles possibly originated from the thermal decomposition products (such as Na2O and SiO2) of sodium alginate and MMT. As shown in Fig. 7(c), for P4A4M4/BA, few irregular particles of size 6–8 μm were distributed on the surface of the char layer. The average relative atomic content of Na and Si in the residue increased to 2.3 At% and 25.3 At%, respectively. In case of the P4A4M4/Ca aerogel (Fig. 7(d)), many relatively regular particles approximately 2–4 μm in diameter were distributed on the surface of the char layer. The average relative atom content of Ca increased to 18.7 At%. It was suggested that these spherical particles possibly originate from the thermal decomposition product (CaO) of calcium alginate. For the P4A4M4/BA/Ca aerogel, a large number of particles with dimensions ranging from 100 nm to 1 μm were distrubted at the surface of the char layer (Fig. 7(e)). As shown in Fig. 7(f), the average relative atomic contents of Ca and O in the residue increased to 21.7 At% and 46.3 At%, respectively, whereas those of C and Si in the residue decreased to 8.5 At% and 3.9 At%, respectively. Thus, these particles at the surface of residue were suggested to originate from the decomposition products (such as CaO, SiO2 and Na2O) of calcium alginate and MMT. Based on these results, we proposed the flame-retardancy mechanisms of the PVA composite aerogels. The addition of MMT and sodium alginate could promote the formation of a dense char layer on the PVA/alginate/MMT aerogel. The post-crosslinking of Ca2+ plays an important role in the improvement of the flame retardancy of the crosslinked P4A4M4/Ca/BA aerogels. The flame-retardancy mechanism of the crosslinked P4A4M4/Ca/BA aerogels is illustrated in Fig. 7(g). In the P4A4M4/BA/Ca composite aerogel, a large amount of micro- and nanoscale inorganic particles (such as CaO, SiO2) decomposed from alginate during combustion were distributed at the surface of residue and formed a barrier between the condensed phase and flame to insulate the diffusion of flammable gases. The accumulation of the nanoﬁllers at the surface of the residue in nanocomposites was because of their lower surface free energy than those of polymers (Lewin, 2003, 2006). Additionally, calcium ions catalyzed the carbonization reaction of P4A4M4 aerogel to form a thicker and denser residue layer, which could effectively inhibit the heat transfer and the smoke propagation. Thus, the P4A4M4/BA/Ca aerogel showed highly efficient flame retardancy and ultra-low smoke toxicity."
12,Conclusions,"A new environment-friendly two-step crosslinking approach was developed to simultaneously improve the compressive property and fire safety of PVA/alginate/MMT composite aerogels. By the two-step crosslinking of borate and Ca2+ ions, the compressive modulus and specific modulus of the P4A4M4/BA/Ca composite aerogel significantly enhanced, and the LOI value increased to 40.0%. Cone calorimeter tests reveal that the pHRR and THR values of the P4A4M4/BA/Ca composite aerogel distinctly decreased. Remarkably, the TSR value of the P4A4M4/BA/Ca composite aerogel was considerably lower than those of the P4A4M4 aerogel, indicating its superior smoke suppression ability. In addition, the FGR value of the P4A4M4/BA/Ca composite aerogel was lower than that of the P4A4M4 aerogel by 80.5%, demonstrating its higher survival chances under a fire hazard. The flame-retardant mechanism of the crosslinked P4A4M4/BA/Ca composite aerogels involved a combination of the gaseous phase and condensed phase flame retardancy. The highly efficient flame-retardantcy, ultra-low-smoke-toxicity PVA/alginate/MMT composite aerogel with good sustainability is a promising alternative to conventional flame-retardant insulation foams."
