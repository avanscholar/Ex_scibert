0,Introduction,"Biodiesel, a biodegradable and renewable form of energy, emitting less carbon monoxide, sulfur compounds, particulate matter and unburned hydrocarbons than traditional diesel [1], is usually composed of fatty acid methyl esters formed by transesterification of renewable triglycerides such as vegetable oils and animal fats with methanol. The vegetable oils being exploited for biodiesel production constitute the edible oils like rapeseed, soybean, palm, and sunflower, of which there is a big gap in the demand and supply. An increase in the production of biodiesel will only be possible by making available new feedstock apart from these edible fatty oils, for both economic and ethical reasons [2]. More than 350 oil-bearing crops have been identified [3]; oils from 75 plant species have been converted to biodiesel and the iodine value (IV) and cetane number (CN) varied from 4.8 to 212 and 20.56 to 67.47, respectively [4]. Many of them are highly unsaturated oils, which are unsuitable as starting materials for direct transesterification to produce biodiesel since their IVs and CNs do not meet the specifications of EN14214 that contains a specification for IV (120, maximum) and CN (51, minimum) [5]. Hempseed oil obtained by expression of hempseed which is a waste of hemp planting is such a typical highly poly-unsaturated vegetable oil with an iodine value of 164g I2/100g. To use the highly un-saturated oils as raw materials for biodiesel production, selective hydrogenation is essential and practical to reduce the degree of un-saturation without increasing the totally saturated components [2]. It is difficult to get the selectivity with the conventional nickel [6] and noble metal-based catalysts like platinum [7] and palladium [8] since these catalysts resulted in the formation of significant quantities of saturated components with high melting points, which compromised the cold-weather behavior of the product obtained [2]. Fortunately, supported copper catalysts possess high selectivity for hydrogenating linolenate (C18:3) to oleate (C18:1) with oleate C18:1 unreduced, therefore, the percentage of saturated is scarcely changed during the hydrogenation process. Acidic oxides like SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, ZnO, and sepiolite have been wildly employed as support for copper catalysts in the hydrogenation [2,9]. Ravasio et al. [10] investigated catalytic performances of copper catalysts on different acidic supports and the effect of catalyst preparation method on the catalytic activity. Cu/SiO2 prepared by chemisorption–hydrolysis (CH) method had a good copper dispersion over supports, and it exhibited high activity and promising selectivity for hydrogenating C18:3 to C18:1 with C18:1 unreduced. Copper catalyst on the less acidic supports like alumina and sepiolite presented less activity but very high selectivity, whereas Cu/TiO2 and Cu/ZnO catalysts with much less acidic supports gave poor results of both activity and selectivity. Copper catalyst prepared by the conventional incipient wetness technique did not show any activity even after very long reaction time. Basic oxides, such as MgO, CaO, SrO, and BaO, have been rarely reported as support for copper catalysts in the hydrogenation except MgO. Derouane et al. [11] used a Cu/MgO catalyst for the hydrogenation of ethylene and they proposed that surface Cu2+ ions were the active species. Okkerse et al. [12] studied a similar catalyst (Cu–Mg–SiO2) for soybean oil hydrogenation and they found that the active center consisted of copper metal crystallites. However, little attention has been focused on the acidity and basicity of the Cu supported catalysts and its effect on catalytic activity toward hydrogenation. Alkaline earth metal oxides (AMOs) including MgO, CaO, SrO, and BaO, have been intensively studied as heterogeneous basic catalysts for transesterification of triglycerides with methanol. AMO became active for transesterification after a thermal pretreatment and the catalytic activities were predominant upon their alkalinities [13]. As the basic strength increased in the order of MgO<CaO<SrO<BaO, which was attributed to the decrease of electro-negativity of the conjugated metal cation of AMO, the catalytic activities of transesterification exhibited in the same sequence. SrO had basic sites stronger than H_=26.5 and gave a biodiesel yield in excess of 95% at 65°C within 30min in the transesterification of soybean oil to biodiesel [14]. Taking into account that AMO presented high catalytic activity for transesterification and copper supported catalyst showed promising hydrogenation selectivity, we developed Cu/AMO as a bi-functional catalyst for transesterification and selective hydrogenation [15]. In the previous work, we explored the catalytic performances of Cu/AMO catalysts for one-pot process combining transesterification and selective hydrogenation under hydrogen pressure conditions and tested the hydrogenated biodiesels obtained. The present study aimed to give a detailed study of the effects of reaction conditions on the transesterification and selective hydrogenation over Cu/AMO catalysts and to give a detailed characterization of Cu/AMO catalysts using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), N2 adsorption, CO2-Temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD), H2-Temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Refined hempseed oil, obtained from Xishuangbanna Dai autonomous prefecture, Yunnan province, China, was used as the starting material since it had an IV of 164g I2/100g which was higher than 120g I2/100g required by EN 14214. The acid value was less than 0.1mg KOH/g. According to GC analysis, the fatty acid consisted of palmitic acid 6.64%, stearic acid 2.76%, oleic acid 10.12%, linoleic acid 54.31%, linolenic acid 23.76%, and traces of other acids. All chemicals used were of analytical grade, which were purchased from Beijing Chemical Co. Ltd., China."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation MgO, CaO, SrO, BaO, and CuO samples were prepared by the conventional precipitation method from metal nitrates using ammonium bicarbonate as precipitate [15]. Cu/AMO were prepared by the CH method [10]. The support was added to a (Cu(NH3)4)2+ solution prepared by adding NH4OH to 100mL Cu(NO3)2·3H2O solution (0.2mol/L) until pH was 9. After 20min under stirring, the slurry was slowly diluted in order to allow hydrolysis of the copper complex and deposition of the finely dispersed product to occur. After that, the solids were separated by filtration, dried overnight at 120°C. Prior to each reaction, the as-prepared catalysts were calcined at 1000°C in vacuum for 5h. The loading amounts of copper oxide were calculated on the basis of the amounts of the initial materials."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Phase identification of calcined Cu/AMO catalysts was performed by powder XRD patterns on a Japan Rigaku D/Max-2500 diffractometer, operated at 28kV and 40mA. The powders were ground and then loaded in sample holders for data collection, using Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.54178Å) and a scanning speed of 10°min−1 over a 2θ range of 5–90°. The phases of the as-prepared catalysts were identified by comparing their peak positions and relative intensities with standard JCPDS files. The texture properties of calcined Cu/AMO were determined from nitrogen adsorption isotherms measured at liquid nitrogen temperature (−196°C) using a Micromeritics Instrument Corp. ASAP 2020. Prior to any adsorption measurement each sample was degassed at 250°C for 8h to eliminate air and water vapor from the capillaries of the pore structure of the solids. Specific surface areas and pore size distributions of the samples were obtained using the BET and BJH calculation methods, respectively. The morphology of calcined Cu/AMO was investigated by SEM, and the images were obtained using a HITACHI S-4700 SEM working at 20kV, and the samples were gold coated prior to analysis. The size of used Cu/SrO catalyst was investigated using a HITACHI H-800 transmission electron operated at 200kV. The basicity of Cu/AMO catalysts was investigated by CO2-TPD, which was performed in a straight quartz tube in Ar flow, using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The standard procedure consisted of pretreatment, saturation, and desorption steps. For each measure 100mg of catalyst powders was pre-heated at a fixed temperature of 500°C for 1h under Ar flow to remove any adsorbate from the surface. Then the sample was cooled down to room temperature and CO2 flow was let in for half an hour for adsorption saturation. After that, the sample was kept under Ar flow for half an hour to purge any gaseous CO2 traces. Afterward, the TPD measurement was performed under heating up to 800°C at a heating rate of 5°C/min. The carrier Ar flow rate was fixed at 25ml/min to avoid re-adsorption of carbon dioxide. The redox properties of as-prepared catalysts were investigated by H2-TPR, which was carried out in the same straight quartz tube used for the CO2-TPD measurements. A 100mg of the calcined Cu/AMO catalysts was out-gassed at 200°C under N2 for 1h. After cooling to room temperature under N2, the gas was switched to 5% H2/N2, and the sample was heated to 800°C at a heating rate of 5°C/min. The amount of H2 consumed was monitored by a TCD. The surface chemical states of the representative strontium oxide supporting copper oxide catalyst was analyzed by XPS, and the XPS measurements were performed with an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions (base vacuum of ∼10−8 Pa) at room temperature. MgKα radiation (hυ =1253.6eV) was used as the X-ray source. The binding energy (BE) values were referenced to the C 1s peak of contaminant carbon at 284.6eV with an uncertainty of ±0.2eV."
5,Reaction procedure and product analysis,"2.4 Reaction procedure and product analysis The catalytic performance of AMO and Cu/AMO were evaluated in the one-pot process combining transesterification of hempseed oil with methanol and selective hydrogenation of un-saturated bonds [15]. For a typical reaction, 100g of hempseed oil and necessary anhydrous methanol (molar ratio of methanol to hempseed oil of 3:1–15:1) with 3g of catalyst immersed was charged into a 500mL stainless steel autoclave, which equipped with a stirrer and a cooling jacket surrounded by a heating mantle controlled by a PID temperature controller. The autoclave was purged with nitrogen, and the last traces of N2/air were removed by a number of pressurizing/depressurizing cycles with H2 before the reaction and then the autoclave was pressured and the contents were heated to designed temperature with a rate of 5°C/min, in all the experiments with constant stirring at 1000rpm to ensure the lack of external mass transfer limitations. Samples were taken out from the reaction mixture every 30min. At the end of reaction, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, vented of H2 and the product mixture was removed. The catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture by filtration, washed with methanol and dried in vacuum. The alcohol phase (glycerin and methanol in excess) was separated from the non-polar organic phase (methyl esters and un-reacted glycerides) by decantation. The products collected were immediately analyzed by a GC3420 gas chromatograph, equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a BFSP-0677-02 column [15]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 Crystal structure XRD patterns of AMO supporting 10wt.% copper oxide samples and used 10wt.% Cu/SrO were displayed in Fig. 1 a. After a careful comparison of diffraction data against a database maintained by the International Centre for Diffraction Data, it is found that Cu/MgO showed the mixed phases of MgO and Mg0.85Cu0.15O, Cu/CaO contained CaO and Ca2CuO3 cuprates, Cu/SrO was comprised of Sr2CuO3 and SrO, and Cu/BaO presented BaCO3 and BaCuO2 cuprates. The used Cu/SrO catalyst showed mixture phases of SrO and Cu, suggesting that the Sr2CuO3 in fresh Cu/SrO catalyst has been reduced to Cu and SrO. AMO have been rarely reported as supports for copper catalyst except MgO, and the phase compositions of MgO supporting copper catalyst have been investigated. Nagaraja et al. [16] reported that Cu/MgO catalysts existed in the phases of MgO and CuO after calcination in air at 450°C for 4h and presented high catalytic efficiency in the vapor phase hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. The experimental Cu/AMO catalysts were designed to be bi-functional, combining heterogeneous bases for transesterification and copper species for selective hydrogenation. Heterogeneous bases show weak basic strength and exhibited no or weak activities for base-catalyzed transesterification with pretreatment normally at relatively low temperatures of around 450°C. It should be noted that basic oxides adsorb carbon dioxide, water, and oxygen to form carbonates, hydroxides, and peroxides on exposure to atmosphere, which lead to the poison of strong basic sites and decrease of basic strength, thus removal of the adsorbed species from the surfaces by high temperature pretreatment is essential to reveal the oxide surfaces [17]. The high temperature pretreatment at 1000°C [17] in this work is undertaken to activate the basic sites of Cu/AMO samples. XRD patterns of Cu/SrO catalysts with different CuO loadings were showed in Fig. 1b. 1% Cu/SrO catalyst showed characteristic diffraction peaks of well-crystallized SrO. The absence of diffraction peaks of Cu-containing compound may be attributed to the high degree of dispersion on the SrO surface, or to the amount being smaller than that detectable via the XRD technique. The XRD patterns of the Cu/SrO catalysts with higher CuO loading amount between 3% and 10% exhibited new peaks of Sr2CuO3. As can be further seen from Fig. 1b, with the increase of CuO loading amount, the intensity of characteristic peaks of Sr2CuO3 increased, and the intensity of SrO peaks weakened, which indicated that the increasing addition of CuO to SrO favored the formation of Sr2CuO3 by solid reaction. On further increasing the CuO loading amount from 20% to 30%, the patterns of the Cu/SrO catalysts presented new peaks of SrCuO2 with the disappearance of peaks of SrO. The phase evolution of Cu/SrO catalysts with different CuO loading amounts is probably attributed to solid-state reactions between SrO and CuO at a high temperature of 1000°C, yielding a strontium-rich solid compound of Sr2CuO3 at a low CuO loading of 1–10wt.% and a copper-rich solid compound of SrCuO2 at a high CuO loading of 10–30wt.%. 3.1.2 Morphology and textural properties SEM images of the as-prepared Cu/AMO and TEM image of used 10wt.% Cu/SrO were showed in Fig. 2 . Cu/MgO and Cu/CaO catalysts consisted of particles in diameter of 50–150nm, and Cu/BaO showed large aggregated particles, which may be formed by sintering. It can be seen from a macroscopic image in Fig. 2d that the as-prepared Cu/SrO catalyst particles were uniform on a large-scale. At higher magnifications, Fig. 2e revealed that Cu/SrO catalyst particles consisted of many interconnected nano-sheets with thicknesses of 50–100nm, which were formed by solid-state reactions of the uniform spherical particles with the average particle size of 35–70nm. As can be seen from Fig. 2f, sphere copper particles with diameter of about 6nm were observed on sheet-like substances in the used Cu/SrO sample. The specific surface areas and average pore sizes of Cu/AMO, AMO, CuO and used 10wt.% Cu/SrO are listed in Table 1 . Cu/AMO catalysts presented lower specific surface areas and larger average pore sizes than AMO. This result indicated that the addition of CuO to AMO led to the decreases of the specific surface areas and increases of pore sizes of the supports, which were probably due to the sintering of AMO and CuO confirmed by the XRD and SEM results of Cu/AMO samples (XRD and SEM data of AMO and CuO not shown). With the increase of CuO loading from 1 to 10wt.%, the BET specific surface increased and reached a maximum of 2.52m2/g at a CuO loading of 10wt.%, and the average pore size of Cu/SrO catalysts decreased from 51.9 to 39.0nm. A further increase of the CuO content resulted in the decrease of specific surface area and increase of average pore size of Cu/SrO catalysts. Cu/AMO catalysts after calcination showed specific surface areas ranged from 1.11 to 18.04m2/g and presented average pore size in the range of 28.1–72.3nm. The used Cu/SrO sample showed specific surface area of 2.38m2/g and average pore size of 41.2nm. 3.1.3 Basicity The strength and amount of basic sites of as-prepared Cu/AMO samples were analyzed by CO2-TPD and the corresponding plots are displayed in Fig. 3 . A desorption peak was observed for Cu/AMOs catalysts, of which the position and area depended on alkaline earth metal oxide support. CO2 desorption temperature increased in the order of 10% Cu/MgO<10% Cu/CaO<10% Cu/SrO<10% Cu/BaO, suggesting that the basic strength increased in the same order. CaO, SrO and BaO supporting CuO catalyst desorbed CO2 at higher temperatures (>600°C) in comparison to that of 420°C in the case of MgO supporting CuO catalysts, suggesting that the strengths of basic sites in these three catalysts were very high, which was conformed by the Hammett indicators results [15]. Table 1 showed carbon dioxide desorption peak of used 10wt.% Cu/SrO and the surface density of CO2 desorbed amount of Cu/AMO and used Cu/SrO. The used Cu/SrO sample showed a lower desorption peak temperature than fresh Cu/SrO, suggesting that a decrease of basic strength occurred in the reaction. The fresh 10% Cu/SrO sample presented the largest surface density of CO2 basic sites among the Cu/AMO samples. The influence of copper oxide content in Cu/SrO catalysts on the basic strength and amount of basic sites was showed in Fig. 3b. A broad desorption peak between 690 and 720°C was observed for all the Cu/SrO catalysts, and the position and intensity was closely related to the CuO loading. The 1% Cu/SrO catalyst with the lowest CuO loading showed a CO2 desorption peak extending from 650 until 780°C, with the maximum value at 713°C. By increasing the amount of CuO loading on the SrO support, the desorption peak become less intense and the maximum desorption peak shifted towards lower temperatures, which corresponded to decreases of basic strengths. The evolution of basic strength of Cu/SrO catalysts with different copper oxide contents may be attributed to the phase compositions, Cu/SrO catalysts with a copper oxide loading between 1% and 10% contained SrO, which was classified as a super base [17], and Sr2CuO3, which may correspond to the intensive desorption peaks at high desorption temperatures, and a higher copper oxide loading led to the disappearances of SrO but formation of copper-rich compounds of SrCuO2, which may result in the decrease of basic strength of Cu/SrO catalysts. Table 1 showed that the amount of basic sites and surface density of basicity of CuO/SrO catalysts decreased with the increase of copper oxide content, which may be attributed to the decreases of SrO content. 3.1.4 Redox properties The H2-TPR profiles of Cu/AMO catalysts were illustrated in Fig. 4 . A single reduction peak was observed for 10wt.% Cu/MgO and 10wt.% Cu/CaO catalysts, while two reduction peaks appeared for 10wt.% Cu/SrO and 10wt.% Cu/BaO catalysts, indicating that AMO support affected the redox properties of copper-based catalysts, which may be attributed to the different copper-containing species of the copper oxide supporting catalysts. Cu/MgO sample presented a single reduction peak in the range of 360–380°C, which was attributed to the reduction of Mg0.85Cu0.15O solid solution formed by the dissolution of copper in the MgO lattice. The reduction of Cu/MgO sample occurred at higher temperature than reported Cu/MgO catalysts [18] which were calcined at lower temperatures and consisted of CuO and MgO. The single reduction peak between 425 and 435°C of Cu/CaO catalyst may be assigned to the reduction of Ca2CuO3 cuprate. The bimodal distribution of the Cu species on the Cu/SrO and Cu/BaO catalysts may be interpreted as the reduction of bulk Cu-containing species at high temperatures and the reduction of surface well dispersed Cu-containing species at low temperatures. Fig. 4a further revealed that the reduction peak area of 10wt.% Cu/SrO was larger than those of other Cu/AMO catalysts, which suggested that Cu/SrO catalyst showed more reduced copper species after reduction than those of other alkaline earth metal oxide supporting copper oxide catalysts. Cu/AMO catalysts showed higher reduction temperatures than that of bulk CuO [18], which could indicate a strong synergistic interaction between copper oxide and alkaline earth metal oxide in the samples. Bridier et al. [19] found that Cu/Al2O3 catalyst calcined at 900°C exhibited a shoulder peak at 327°C and a broad low-intensity peak at 447°C that were assigned to the reduction of relatively large copper oxide particles and reduction of CuAl2O4 [19], respectively. The redox properties of copper catalysts were closely related to the calcined temperature, and the high calcined temperature resulted in the high reduction temperature, which is consistent with the high reduction temperatures of experimental Cu/AMO calcined at 1000°C. Thus, it can be concluded that copper-containing species of Cu/AMO catalysts presented different reduction behaviors and Cu/SrO catalyst showed more reduced copper species amount than those of other alkaline earth metal oxide supporting copper oxide catalysts. The redox properties of Cu/SrO catalysts with copper oxide contents in the range of 1–30% were further investigated by H2-TPR, and the corresponding profiles were showed in Fig. 4b. A broad low-intensity reduction peak between 420 and 510°C and an intensive peak in the range of 540–640°C were detected for all the Cu/SrO catalysts, of which the peak at low temperatures may be assigned to the reduction of surface well-dispersed copper compounds, and the peak at high temperature could be ascribed to the reduction of bulk copper compounds. With the increase of copper oxide loading from 1 to 10wt.%, the maximum reduction temperature of the low-temperature peak shifted to lower values, and the corresponding peak area increased, which suggested the decrease of copper oxide-strontium oxide interaction and increase of well dispersed surface Sr2CuO3. A further increase of copper oxide loading resulted in the increase of reduction temperature and the decrease of peak areas, which may be attributed to the increase of particle sizes of Sr2CuO3 and SrCuO2 and decrease of surface copper-containing species. Reddy et al. [18] observed a similar phenomenon in the TPR analysis of Cu/MgO catalysts and claimed that the higher reduction temperature at lower loadings could be attributed to the metal-support interaction and the shift of reduction temperature to lower values with the increase of Cu loading might due to the increased contribution of uniformly dispersed CuO crystallites. Fig. 4b also showed that T max of the higher-temperature reduction peak shifted to lower temperatures with the increase of copper oxide loading, indicating that the bulk copper species of Cu/SrO catalyst with higher copper oxide loading can be reduced easier. The increase of copper oxide loading also led to the increase of reduction peak areas, which suggested that Cu/SrO catalyst with higher copper oxide loading presented more reduced copper species. It seems that 10wt.% Cu/SrO catalyst presented more amount of surface copper species than Cu/SrO catalysts with other CuO loadings and bulk copper species of Cu/SrO catalysts can be reduced easier with high copper oxide content. 3.1.5 Surface chemical state XPS was used to evaluate the surface chemical states of the representative 10% Cu/SrO catalyst before and after the catalytic reactions, and the XPS spectra were illustrated in Fig. 5 . Fig. 5a showed that all the expected elements including O, Sr and Cu as well as C are present on the surface of Cu/SrO catalyst before and after the catalytic reactions. A careful examination of the Cu 2p core levels was further conducted to provide information on the oxidation state of copper species in the Cu/SrO catalyst before and after the catalytic reaction, and the Cu 2p region spectra were showed in Fig. 5b. The spectrum of Cu/SrO catalyst before the catalytic reaction showed Cu 2p1/2 photoelectron peak at 952.90eV, Cu 2p3/2 photoelectron peak at 933.35eV whose half width was 4.55eV and a shake-up satellite at 940–947eV, which are characteristic of Cu2+ with electron configuration of d9 [20]. These results indicated that copper in the 10% Cu/SrO catalyst before the catalytic reaction existed in the oxidation state of Cu2+. Typically, the Cu 2p3/2 BE of CuO is found at ca. 933.50eV [21]. The variation of the Cu 2p3/2 BE values in 10% Cu/SrO catalyst from CuO is an indication of the formation of different copper species in calcined Cu/SrO catalyst. Consistent theoretical results and experimental data of core-level XPS on Sr2CuO3 cuprates were reported by Waidacher et al. [22] who found that Sr2CuO3 presented Cu 2p3/2 photoelectron peak at about 933.20eV. XRD results showed that 10% Cu/SrO catalyst consisted of Sr2CuO3 and SrO phases. Taking these XPS results and XRD results into account, Cu 2p3/2 photoelectron peak at 933.35eV can be attributed to Sr2CuO3 cuprates. After the one-pot process combining transesterification and selective hydrogenation under hydrogen pressure of 3.0MPa at 180°C, the shake-up satellite peak disappeared and the BE of the Cu 2p3/2 signal was lowered to 932.60eV, accompanied by a decrease in the pea half width to 3.30eV, which indicated that Cu2+ in Sr2CuO3 has been reduced. Dong et al. [23] assigned the BE of the Cu 2p3/2 signal at 932.60eV to the metal copper, which is in line with the results reported by Sheffer et al. [24]. It is likely that the copper species in the 10% Cu/SrO catalyst before the reaction is mainly in the form of CuSr2O3, which has been reduced to metallic copper after reaction under hydrogen pressure of 3.0MPa at 180°C. As the O1s BE decreases, electron pair donation becomes stronger, which suggested that the basic strength of the catalyst increases; the XPS BE of oxygen reflects the basic strength of a heterogeneous base [17]. Fig. 5c showed the O1s region of 10% Cu/SrO before and after the reaction. The BE of O1s in the pure SrO is 531eV [25]. As can be seen from Fig. 5c, the O1s BE of 10% Cu/SrO before the catalytic reaction is 531.20eV, which shifts to higher BE by 0.20eV. The slight positive shift of BE indicated that the addition of copper oxide lead to a slight decrease of the basic strength of Cu/SrO catalyst compared with SrO, which was in agreement with the basic strength results of SrO and 10% Cu/SrO catalyst investigated by CO2-TPD. It can be further seen from Fig. 5c that the O1s BE of 10% Cu/SrO after the catalytic reaction is 531.70eV, which further shifts to higher BE by 0.50eV compared to 10% Cu/SrO sample before catalytic reaction. This result suggested that the basic strength of 10% Cu/SrO catalyst decreased after the catalytic reaction, which can be conformed by the CO2-TPD result of used Cu/SrO catalyst. The decreased basic strength of used Cu/SrO catalyst may be attributed to the coverage of reactants or products."
8,Catalytic performance of Cu/AMO catalysts,"3.2 Catalytic performance of Cu/AMO catalysts Stoichiometrically, 3mol of methanol are required for transforming each mole of triglyceride to produce 3mol fatty acid methyl esters; but in practice, a large excess of methanol were required to shift the equilibrium transesterification reaction favorably because the transesterification reaction is reversible [14]. Fig. 6 a shows the influence of the molar ratio of methanol to oil on biodiesel yield over Cu/AMO catalysts. As the molar ratio of methanol to oil rose from 3 to 12, the biodiesel yield increased sharply for all the Cu/AMO catalysts. A further increase of molar ratio of methanol to oil made weak increase of biodiesel yield. When the molar ratio of methanol/oil was over 12:1, glycerol separation became more difficult, thus decreasing the biodiesel yield. Thus, 12:1 was chosen for the molar ratio methanol/oil in the following reactions. With the molar ratio of methanol to oil of 12:1, Cu/AMO catalysts showed biodiesel yields in the range of 73–96% and the biodiesel yield increased in the order of Cu/MgO<Cu/CaO<Cu/BaO<Cu/SrO. Biodiesel yield of 96% was obtained for Cu/SrO catalyst, which was intensively studied to reveal the optimum reaction conditions for transesterification and selective hydrogenation. Yield and fatty acid methyl esters compositions of biodiesels obtained over Cu/SrO catalysts with different CuO loadings were illustrated in Fig. 6b. With the increase of copper oxide loading from 1% to 10%, biodiesel yield increased from 90% to 96%, C18:3 and methyl linoleate (C18:2) decreased gradually and C18:1 increased consequently. A further increase of copper oxide loading from 10% to 30% resulted in the decrease of biodiesel yield and slight increases of C18:3 and C18:2 and a decrease of C18:1. As a result, the CuO content of 10% is the optimum value for Cu/SrO catalyst for transesterification and the selective hydrogenation under conditions employed in our study. Fig. 6c showed the dependence of yield and compositions of biodiesel on the hydrogen pressure over 10% Cu/SrO catalyst. An increase of hydrogen pressure leads to a slight decrease of biodiesel yield, which may be attributed to the specific low concentration of methanol in the system medium owing to the increase of hydrogen gas amount. Furthermore, it can be seen that the increasing hydrogen pressure favored the selective hydrogenation. As the hydrogen pressure increased from 0 to 3.0MPa, C18:3 and C18:2 reduced sharply and C18:1 increased significantly. A further increase of hydrogen pressure from 3.0 to 5.0MPa made a weak decrease of C18:3 and C18:2 and increase of C18:1. The amount of saturated C18:0 and C16:0 were not affected by the hydrogen pressure. A higher hydrogen pressure will need a higher equipment investment, thus resulting in higher cost for biodiesel production. Hydrogen pressure of 3.0MPa was selected for one-pot process combining transesterification and hydrogenation. Fig. 6d presented the influence of reaction temperature ranging from 60 to 220°C on biodiesel yield and fatty acid methyl esters compositions over 10% Cu/SrO catalyst. As the temperature exceeded over 60°C, biodiesel yield reduced slightly. This may be attributed to the methanol vaporization and bubble formation and thus inhibition of the reaction on the three-phase interface [14]. Fatty acid methyl esters composition almost did not change until reaction temperature increased to 150°C, suggesting that selective hydrogenation did not occur when reaction temperature was lower than 150°C. Increasing reaction temperature resulted in the decrease of poly-unsaturated C18:3 and C18:2 and increase of C18:1 with saturated components unchanged. Fig. 6e showed the evolution of catalytic performance of 10% Cu/SrO catalyst toward biodiesel yield and the compositions of fatty acid methyl esters with time. No significant difference of biodiesel yield in the reaction time of 30–300min was observed, indicating that the transesterification of hempseed oil with methanol can be completed over 10% Cu/SrO catalyst within 30min. Fatty acid methyl esters composition changed slightly in the initial 120min, suggesting that the rate of selective hydrogenation was slow in this induction period, which may be corresponded to the time of reducing copper catalyst. With the increase of reaction time from 120min to 180min, poly-unsaturated C18:3 and C18:2 decreased drastically and C18:1 increased accordingly. A further increase of reaction time led to a slight decrease of poly-unsaturates. It can be concluded that 10% Cu/SrO catalyst presented promising catalytic performance for transesterification and selective hydrogenation to produce biodiesel and increasing reaction temperature, hydrogen pressure and time favor the selective hydrogenation."
9,The recycling of Cu/SrO catalysts in the one-pot process combining transesterification and selective hydrogenation,"3.3 The recycling of Cu/SrO catalysts in the one-pot process combining transesterification and selective hydrogenation The recycling of Cu/SrO catalysts in the one-pot process combining transesterification and selective hydrogenation was investigated. After a one-pot reaction was completed, Cu/SrO catalyst was recovered by filtering, washed with methanol and dried in vacuum. Fresh hempseed oil and methanol were added in amounts similar to the initial reaction. The biodiesel yield and composition of methyl esters of Cu/SrO catalysts in the successive one-pot process were showed in Fig. 6f. As can be seen, biodiesel yields catalyzed over Cu/SrO were in excess of 92% every time and the Cu/SrO catalyst maintained sustained transesterification activity even after being used for 8 cycles and the biodiesel yield was only slightly decreased. The slight decrease of transesterification activity may be attributed to the slight decrease of strength and amount of basic sites of used Cu/SrO catalyst. Cu/SrO catalyst used one time showed promising activity and selectivity for selective hydrogenation since only a small increase of poly-unsaturates and a small decrease of mono-unsaturate was observed. With a further increase of repeated times of Cu/SrO catalyst, poly-unsaturated C18:3 and C18:2 increased and mono-unsaturated C18:1 decreased, suggesting that loss of hydrogenation activity occurred for used Cu/SrO catalyst, which could be ascribed to the catalyst loss in the repeated experiments."
10,Relationship between catalytic performance and structural properties of the bi-functional catalysts,"3.4 Relationship between catalytic performance and structural properties of the bi-functional catalysts It was found that Cu/MgO and Cu/CaO had larger surface areas of 18.04 and 12.78m2/g, respectively, whereas Cu/BaO and Cu/SrO had the lowest of 1.11 and 2.52m2/g, respectively. However, it was interesting to note that, despite having lower surface areas, Cu/BaO and Cu/SrO presented much higher biodiesel yields than those of Cu/MgO and Cu/CaO. The order of basic strengths and biodiesel yields of Cu/BaO and Cu/SrO catalysts are found higher than Cu/CaO and Cu/MgO. The basic strength of Cu/AMO catalysts and the catalytic activity for transesterification in terms of biodiesel yield increased in the same order of Cu/MgO<Cu/CaO<Cu/SrO, which strongly suggested that the catalytic activities of Cu/AMO catalysts toward the transesterification are associated with their basic strengths. Cu/SrO showed a lower basic strength than Cu/BaO, but presented a higher biodiesel yield, which may be ascribed to a larger surface density of basicity than Cu/BaO, as shown in Table 1. The effect of copper oxide content on the biodiesel yield obtained over Cu/SrO catalysts could be attributed to the evolution of specific surface areas of Cu/SrO catalysts because a high catalytic activity can be obtained on a catalyst with a high surface area if the catalysts exhibit a similar chemical structure and acid–base behavior because of the larger contact surface with reactants over the catalyst with a higher surface area [26]. Thus, it seems that the catalytic performance toward transesterification is closely correlated to the basic strengths, surface density of basicity, and specific surface areas of alkaline earth metal oxide supporting copper oxide. The copper catalysts were usually charged into the oil in the oxidized form and were partly reduced to Cu (I) and/or Cu (0) during use [27]. Johansson [28] found that the most ideal copper catalyst for fat hydrogenation seems to consist of small copper metal crystallites partially covering a layer of oxidic copper which was resistant to further reduction. The experimental Cu/AMO catalysts were prepared by the CH method and charged into the oil in the oxidized form. The transesterification over SrO can be completed in a short reaction time of about 0.5h [14], while the hydrogenation of unsaturated bonds over copper catalysts required much longer time [10] since the copper catalysts should be reduced by hydrogen gas and the H2 molecular adsorbed by the copper site required to dissociate as well. It is assumed that the transesterification of hempseed oils with methanol firstly took place on the strong basic surface of Cu/SrO catalysts, producing hempseed methyl esters. Hempseed methyl esters were then adsorbed at the oxidic copper surface, which is possibly activated by a limited reduction of copper compound to metal [28]. Cu/SrO catalysts presented strong basic strengths, suggesting that Cu/SrO showed a strong tendency of electron donating, which will increase the density of electron cloud around copper ions and then retard the reduction and thus improve the adsorption ability of oxygen-containing compound. The used Cu/SrO catalyst showed a weaker basic strength than fresh one, and the copper species in oxidized form have been reduced to Cu (0), which may lead to the decrease of adsorption ability of oxygen-containing compound and then lead to the decrease of catalytic activity of repeated Cu/SrO catalysts toward selective hydrogenation. H2-TPR results showed that Cu/SrO catalyst presented surface copper species and bulk copper species, and the former can be reduced easier. The surface copper species of Cu/SrO were gradually reduced to metallic copper in the reaction medium at 180°C and 3.0MPa hydrogen pressure, which were conformed by the XPS and XRD results and the red color of the used Cu/SrO catalyst after the one-pot process combining transesterification and selective hydrogenation. It is found that with the increase of copper oxide content from 1% to 10%, the amount of surface copper species of Cu/SrO catalyst increased, resulting in the increase of active copper amounts and then leading to the improved catalytic activity for selective hydrogenation with poly-unsaturated C18:3 and C18:2 decreased significantly and mono-unsaturated C18:1 increased accordingly. A further increase of copper oxide content led to the decrease of surface copper species, and also resulted in the decrease of hydrogenation activity. Therefore, the evolution of catalytic activity of Cu/SrO catalysts with different copper oxide contents for selective hydrogenation may be attributed be the amount of surface copper species. It can be concluded that the surface copper species of Cu/SrO catalysts have been reduced to metallic copper and the catalytic activity for selective hydrogenation was closely correlated to the amount of reduced surface copper species."
11,Conclusions,"Alkaline earth metal oxides supporting copper oxide (Cu/AMO) catalysts formed alkaline earth cuprates. MgO, CaO, and BaO supporting copper oxide presented particles in diameter of 50–150nm, while CuO/SrO catalyst consisted of interconnected nano-sheets with thicknesses of 50–100nm. Increasing of hydrogen pressure and reaction temperature favored the decreases of poly-unsaturated C18:3 and C18:2 and increase of C18:1 with saturated C18:0 unchanged. The catalytic activities toward transesterification are strongly dependent on strength and amount of basic sites. The surface copper species of CuO/SrO catalysts were reduced to metal atoms after the reaction, which was closely correlated to the activity of selective hydrogenation."
