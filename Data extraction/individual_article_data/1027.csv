0,Introduction,"The problems associated with fossil fuels consumption, such as greenhouse gases emission, finite resources, and high cost of exploitation have accelerated efforts towards finding carbon neutral, renewable, and economical alternatives. Although there may be no solution satisfying all criteria, biodiesel has attracted a great deal of attention over the last few decades. Biodiesel is most commonly produced through the transesterification of vegetable oils and animal fats, which inevitably produces 100 Kg of crude glycerol per ton of biodiesel [1–3]. The large increase in biodiesel production has therefore caused an undesirable oversupply of glycerol. It is predicted that 3 megatons of glycerol will be produced by 2020, while its commercial demand is expected to remain below 0.5 megatons. This surplus has led to a significant decrease in the price of glycerol over the past few years and to the consideration of glycerol as a waste rather than a co-product, which may jeopardize biodiesel policies. Consequently, discovering new applications of glycerol in fuel and chemical industries is indispensable to avoid the continuous fall of glycerol price and improve the economics of biodiesel production [4,5]. One of the most promising alternatives is using glycerol as a renewable source to produce hydrogen via steam reforming (SR) process. The type of catalyst employed in this process strongly influences the product selectivity and yield. In order to favor hydrogen production, the catalyst must promote the rupture of C–C, O–H, and C–H bonds and facilitate the water gas shift (WGS) reaction, whilst preserving the C–O bonds [3,6,7]. To date, most studies in this area have been devoted to Pt, Pd, Ir, Rh, Ru, Co, and Ni based catalysts. Among the above-mentioned active metals, Ni has received the most attention due to its high ability to break C–C bonds and also promote the WGS reaction, high availability, and low cost. However, most Ni-based catalysts suffer seriously from coking and metal sintering, which lead to a decrease in catalysts’ activity and stability [3,4,8,9]. To overcome these obstacles, different approaches have been employed including (i) tailoring metal dispersion and metal/support interactions by embedding Ni in specific structures such as perovskites, layered-double hydroxides, and oxide solid solutions, and (ii) introducing a wide range of additives and promoters to create specific surface centers, mainly acid/base, bimetallic or redox sites [7,10]. The NiAl2O4 spinel structure has been well recognized as one of the structures for tailoring the Ni dispersion in Ni-based catalysts used for SR reactions [10–14]. Embedding Ni in the spinel structure of NiAl2O4 provides high stability and distribution for the metallic Ni particles after reduction and consequently, decreases the coke formation [10,11]. It is well acknowledged that smaller Ni particles have a higher saturation concentration of carbon than larger Ni ones because of their higher surface/volume ratio [15,16]. This leads to a smaller driving force for carbon diffusion and so, a higher resistance to coke formation for the catalysts with smaller Ni particles. Despite its benefits, the potential of NiAl2O4 spinel as a catalyst in SR reactions has only been slightly exploited so far, particularly in SR of biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons. It is probably because of the following difficulties frequently encountered when using NiAl2O4 spinel as a catalyst for SR reactions: (i) It is well acknowledged that the active phase in SR reaction is the reduced metallic nickel (Ni0). Considering the fact that NiAl2O4 spinel is more difficult to reduce than NiO, the formation of NiAl2O4 can lead to a lower number of Ni0 active sites after reduction [17–20]. One of the most important factors affecting the reducibility of NiAl2O4 is the distribution of nickel between tetrahedral and octahedral sites, the former one being more difficult to reduce. The distribution of nickel between tetrahedral and octahedral sites is highly dependent on the synthesis method of NiAl2O4, particularly the thermal treatment (calcination) step [21–23]. To better exploit the potential benefits of using NiAl2O4 in SR reactions, the development of a synthesis method that improves the reducibility of NiAl2O4 is therefore pivotal. (ii) Once NiAl2O4 is reduced, the catalyst consists of metallic Ni species dispersed over Al2O3 support. Due to the presence of acid sites (mainly of Lewis type), alumina promotes side reactions such as dehydration, isomerization, and polymerization, which produce unsaturated hydrocarbons that are coke precursors. One possible strategy to improve the resistance of Ni-based alumina-supported catalysts toward coking is to modify them by the addition of either alkaline oxides or rare-earth oxides [23–27]. CeO2, a rare-earth oxide known for its oxygen storage capacity, has been widely used as a promoter for Ni-based alumina-supported catalysts in SR reactions of hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds, such as glycerol. Studies performed on steam reforming of glycerol (SRG) revealed that the addition of CeO2 to Ni-based alumina-supported catalysts enhanced their catalytic performance by (i) improving the stability of Al2O3, (ii) enhancing the dispersion of metallic nickel active sites, (iii) preventing the sintering of metallic nickel species, (iv) favoring the WGS reaction, and (iv) especially, suppressing coke formation [3,23,25,26,28,29]. In this context, the main objective of the present work is to propose a novel method for the synthesis of NiAl2O4 spinel, which involved the synthesis of Ni-Al mixed-metal alkoxide through a solvothermal method followed by a two-step calcination procedure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this method has been proposed for the preparation of NiAl2O4. For comparison purposes, NiAl2O4 spinel was also prepared by two other methods: (i) the conventional one-step calcination of Ni-Al mixed-metal alkoxide and (ii) the two-step calcination of Ni-Al mixed-metal hydroxide obtained from the conventional co-precipitation method. The potential of the synthesized catalysts for hydrogen production via SRG was thoroughly investigated. In addition, a detailed study was performed to investigate the influence of CeO2 addition on the rate of coke formation over the NiAl2O4 spinel synthesized by two-step calcination of Ni-Al mixed-metal alkoxide. To rationalize the catalytic performance of the developed materials in SRG reaction, the fresh and used catalysts were characterized by XRD, N2 physisorption, H2-TPR, XPS, SEM, TEM, TGA, and Raman spectroscopy."
1,Experimental procedure,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation A novel and simple synthesis method was developed for the preparation of NiAl2O4 spinel. In this method, a Ni-Al mixed-metal alkoxide designated as (Ni,Al)-Glycerate was prepared by a solvothermal method as a precursor for NiAl2O4 spinel. All reagents were of analytical grade and were used without any further purification. In a typical synthesis, 1.32 g of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (99.9 %, Fisher Scientific) and 3.48 g of Al(NO3)3·9H2O (99+ %, Acros) were added to glycerol (> 99.5 %, VWR International) so as to obtain the concentration of 20 gmetal nitrates Lglycerol −1. The mixture was stirred at 50−60 °C for 2 h. Thereafter, the obtained solution was transferred into a 460 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 160 °C for 7 h in an electric oven. After the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature naturally, the resultant olive-green gelatinous precipitate ((Ni,Al)-Glycerate) was collected by centrifugation, washed several times with ethanol and dried at 100 °C overnight. Finally, the as-synthesized (Ni,Al)-Glycerate was calcined in two different ways to obtain NiAl2O4 spinel: (i) one-step calcination that was performed under air flow during the entire period of time (raising the temperature from 25 °C to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in air and maintaining the temperature at 900 °C for 3 h in air) and (ii) two-step calcination, in which the calcination atmosphere was switched from argon to air when the temperature reached 900 °C (increasing the temperature from 25 °C to 900 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1 in argon and keeping the temperature at 900 °C for 3 h in air). Hereafter, the NiAl2O4 samples prepared by one-step and two-step calcination of (Ni,Al)-Glycerate are abbreviated to NiAl_G1 and NiAl_G2, respectively. For comparison purposes, NiAl2O4 spinel was also prepared by the conventional co-precipitation method. First, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (99.9 %, Fisher Scientific) and Al(NO3)3·9H2O (99+ %, Acros) were dissolved in distilled water to obtain a Al3+/Ni2+ molar ratio of 2. Next, a 0.6 M ammonium hydroxide solution (28.0–30.0 %, Anachemia) was added to the nitrate solution at the rate of 3 mL min−1 until the pH changed from 4 to 8. The precipitate was then washed with distilled water several times and dried at 100 °C overnight. The obtained powder was calcined using the aforementioned two-step calcination method. The NiAl2O4 catalyst synthesized via the co-precipitation method is designated as NiAl_C. CeO2-promoted NiAl_G2 catalyst was prepared using the conventional dry impregnation method. To this end, 10 wt.% CeO2 was added into the NiAl_G2 catalyst by using Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (99 %, Sigma-Aldrich) as metal precursor. After the impregnation step, the obtained paste was firstly dried at 100 °C overnight and then calcined at 800 °C for 2 h in air. The prepared catalyst is labeled as Ce/NiAl_G2."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by using a Bruker SMART APEXII X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ =1.54059 Å). Bragg angles between 10° and 90° were scanned with a step size of 0.04° and a counting time of 0.6 s per step. The mean crystallite diameters of NiAl2O4, CeO2, and Ni were calculated using Scherrer’s equation from the diffraction peaks at 2θ of 37.010°, 28.555°, and 44.508°, respectively. Prior to the XRD analysis, the reduced samples were prepared by treating the as-synthesized catalysts in a 20 % H2/Ar flow (62.5 mL min−1) at 800 °C for 1.5 h. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were acquired using a Micromeritics, TriStar 3000 analyzer. While specific surface areas were calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method in the relative pressure range of 0.05-0.3, pore size distributions were determined by the Barret-Joyner-Hallender (BJH) method. Prior to measurements, all samples were outgassed at 200 °C for 3 h. H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) analysis was performed using a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 chemisorption analyzer. In a typical experiment, ∼ 30 mg of freshly calcined catalyst was loaded in a U-type quartz reactor and heated to 900 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1 in a gas mixture of 10 vol.% H2/Ar (total flowrate of 50 mL min−1). A cold trap submerged in a Dewar flask containing a mixture of 2-propanol and liquid N2 was used to remove the water formed during reduction from the gas stream before reaching the TCD detector. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed using a Kratos Axis Ultra spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray radiation source operating at 300 W. Peak fitting and calculation of relative atomic concentrations were performed with a CasaXPS software. The C-C/C–H C 1s signal set to a binding energy of 285.0 eV was used as an internal reference to correct the binding energy scale. Prior to the XPS analysis, the reduced samples were prepared by treating the as-synthesized catalysts in a 20 % H2/Ar flow (62.5 mL min−1) at 800 °C for 1.5 h. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques were employed to examine the morphology of catalysts and the type of coke. SEM and TEM analyses were carried out on a JEOL 6360 electron microscope (accelerating voltage: 15 kV) and a JEOL JEM 1230 electron microscope (accelerating voltage: 120 kV), respectively. TEM images were also analyzed by Digimizer image analysis software to determine the average particle size of Ni0. For each sample, the size of more than 100 Ni0 particles selected in several TEM images was measured to obtain the particle size distribution and the average particle size of Ni0. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was employed to investigate both the amount and the type of carbon species deposited on the catalysts in the course of SRG reaction. The TGA tests were performed using a TGA Q5000 V3.17 Build 265 instrument. In a typical test, ∼ 20 mg of used catalyst was heated from ambient temperature to 800 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1 under 50 mL min−1 of air flow. The weight change as a function of temperature was recorded in this process. Raman spectroscopy was applied to study the nature and graphitization degree of carbon deposits formed during SRG reaction. The Raman spectra were collected using an Olympus BX40 microscope with a 50× long distance objective in the back-scattering geometry and an excitation wavelength of 532 nm with a laser power of 6.25 mW. For each sample, at least three Raman spectra were recorded in different areas to assure the homogeneity of the investigated material."
4,Catalytic performance evaluation,"2.3 Catalytic performance evaluation The SRG reaction was performed in a fixed-bed tubular stainless steel reactor (internal diameter of 11 mm and total length of 400 mm) under atmospheric pressure at 630 °C with a water to glycerol molar ratio (W/G) of 9, a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 19,600 cm3 gcat −1 h−1, and a glycerol solution to argon molar ratio of 1. In a typical experiment, 0.5 g of as-prepared catalyst was loaded on a perforated plate, which was installed in the middle of reactor to support the catalyst bed. Prior to the SRG reaction, the catalyst was reduced in situ at 800 °C under a 62.5 mL min−1 of 20 % H2/Ar flow for 1.5 h. The reactor temperature was monitored and controlled by a temperature controller (Omega, CN-7800) that was connected to a K-type thermocouple located in the catalyst bed. Argon (99.99 %, Praxair) and hydrogen (99.99 %, Praxair) were supplied from the top of reactor using Brooks (5850 i Series) mass flow controllers. Thereafter, the reactor was cooled down to the reaction temperature under argon flow to completely eliminate the residual hydrogen. After the reactor temperature was stabilized, the glycerol solution with a W/G molar ratio of 9 (prepared from > 99.5 % glycerol (VWR International)) was introduced into the top of reactor though a 0.25 mm needle by using a HPLC pump (Isocratic Bodman Digital Pump). The reactor effluent was passed through an ice bath to separate the liquid products. The flowrate of outlet gas stream was subsequently measured using a Brooks (5850 i Series) mass flowmeter. The gaseous products were analyzed online by a microGC (Agilent 3000A Micro GC) equipped with a Molsieve column (10 m × 320 μm × 12 μm), a PLOTU column (8 m × 320 μm × 30 μm), and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The analysis of liquid products was carried out using a combination of gas chromatography (Agilent 7820A, with a 600 μm ×2.2 mm ×2 m glass packed column, equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID)) and liquid chromatography (Shimadzu SPD-M20A HPLC, with an Agilent Poroshell 120 HILIC-Z column, equipped with a refractive index detector (RID)). The performance of the synthesized catalysts in SRG reaction was reported in terms of total glycerol conversion ( X G l y c e r o l , t o t a l ), glycerol conversion into gaseous ( X G l y c e r o l , g a s ) and liquid ( X G l y c e r o l , l i q u i d ) products, H2 yield ( Y H 2 ) , and gaseous ( S i ) and liquid ( S i ' ) products selectivity. These parameters were calculated using the following equations: (1) X G l y c e r o l , t o t a l = ( G l y c e r o l i n − G l y c e r o l o u t G l y c e r o l o u t ) × 100 (2) X G l y c e r o l , g a s = ( m o l e s o f C a t o m s i n t h e g a s e o u s p r o d u c t s m o l e s o f C a t o m s i n t h e f e e d ) × 100 (3) X G l y c e r o l , l i q u i d = ( m o l e s o f C a t o m s i n t h e l i q u i d p r o d u c t s m o l e s o f C a t o m s i n t h e f e e d ) × 100 (4) Y H 2 = ( m o l e s o f H 2 p r o d u c e d 7 × m o l e s o f g l y c e r o l i n t h e f e e d ) × 100 (5) S H 2 = ( m o l e s o f H 2 p r o d u c e d m o l e s o f C a t o m s i n t h e g a s e o u s p r o d u c t s ) × ( 3 7 ) × 100 (6) S i = ( m o l e s o f C a t o m s i n s p e c i e i m o l e s o f C a t o m s i n t h e g a s e o u s p r o d u c t s ) × 100 where i refers to CO2, CO, CH4, and C2+. C2+ includes the sum of all other gaseous hydrocarbon products such as ethane, ethylene, acetylene, and propane. (7) S i ' = ( m o l e s o f C a t o m s i n s p e c i e i ' m o l e s o f C a t o m s i n t h e l i q u i d p r o d u c t s ) × 100 where i ' refers to acetaldehyde, acetic acid, acetone, acrolein, allyl alcohol, dihydroxyacetone, ethylene glycol, formaldehyde, glyceraldehyde, hydroxyacetone (acetol), methanol, and 1,2-propanediol. To perform carbon balance, the moles of carbon atoms in the gaseous and liquid products were measured by gas and liquid chromatography techniques as mentioned above. In order to calculate the moles of carbon atoms in the carbon deposits, an air flow was passed over the catalyst after each SRG experiment and the amount of CO2 and CO evolved was measured using the microGC. Based on the conversions of glycerol to gaseous, liquid, and solid (carbon deposits) products, the carbon balance error can be calculated using the following equation: (8) C a r b o n b a l a n c e e r r o r = 1 − m o l e s o f C a t o m s i n t h e o u t l e t m o l e s o f C a t o m s i n t h e i n l e t × 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of fresh catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of fresh catalysts The crystalline structures of all the calcined and reduced catalysts were examined by XRD and the corresponding patterns are illustrated in Fig. 1 (a) and (b). As can be seen in Fig. 1(a), NiAl2O4 was the only crystalline phase detected for the calcined NiAl_G1, NiAl_G2, and NiAl_C catalysts with clear peaks at 2θ of 19.071°, 31.407°, 37.010°, 44.997°, 59.663°, 65.537°, and 77.745° (ICDD # 00-010-0339). In the case of CeO2-promoted NiAl_G2 catalyst, the reflections at 2θ of 28.555°, 33.082°, 47.479°, and 56.335°, which correspond to the cubic phase of CeO2 (ICDD # 00-034-0394), were also identified in addition to the peaks associated with the NiAl2O4 phase. For all the reduced catalysts (Fig. 1(b)), the main diffraction peaks perfectly match those of Ni0 phase (ICDD # 00-004-0850). In addition, a nickel-aluminum mixed oxide (Ni2Al18O29, ICDD # 00-022-0451) was simultaneously formed upon NiAl2O4 reduction. It should be mentioned that the NiAl2O4 phase was probably still present in all the reduced samples because of the high temperature needed for its total reduction. Regarding the Ce/NiAl_G2 catalyst, the diffraction peaks associated with the fluorite structure of CeO2 almost disappeared after the reduction treatment. As revealed by Kamonsuangkasem et al. [3], the disappearance of CeO2 characteristic peaks might be due to the transformation of CeO2 to a highly-dispersed CeAlO3 phase, while no diffraction peaks corresponding to that phase were observed because of its high dispersion. The CeAlO3 phase can be formed during the reduction treatment upon the incorporation of cerium species into the alumina structure where the surface of ceria is in good contact with the alumina surface [26]. It has been reported that the formation of CeAlO3 can prevent the sintering of nickel species [3]. Calculating the average crystallite size of Ni0 using the Scherrer’s equation indicated that the Ni0 crystallite size of Ce/NiAl_G2 catalyst was smaller than that of NiAl_G2 catalyst (Table 1 ). The physical properties of the calcined catalysts determined from N2 physisorption measurements are provided in Fig. 2 and Table 2 . The NiAl_G1 and NiAl_G2 catalysts, synthesized via one- and two-step calcination of (Ni,Al)-Glycerate, show narrower pore size distributions with smaller average pore diameters and higher BET surface areas than the material prepared by the co-precipitation technique (NiAl_C). These results reflect the more developed mesoporous structure of the NiAl2O4 samples prepared from (Ni,Al)-Glycerate over the one prepared by the conventional co-precipitation technique. This can be attributed to the large volume of gases released during the calcination of (Ni,Al)-Glycerate precursor. After impregnating CeO2 promoter into NiAl_G2, the BET surface area and total pore volume were decreased probably because the small and some large pores were blocked and partially filled with the CeO2 promoter. The H2-TPR profiles of the freshly calcined catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . A Gaussian-type deconvolution was applied to determine the type of reducible species and their corresponding H2 consumption (Table 3 ). Regarding the NiAl_G1, NiAl_G2, and NiAl_C catalysts, a strong peak was detected between 700 and 900 °C, which can be associated with the reduction of NiAl2O4 spinel structure. For NiAl_G2 and NiAl_C, a very small peak was also recorded between 400 and 500 °C, which can be assigned to the reduction of free NiO [10,30]. However, the major reduction occurred at high temperature (Table 3), indicating that there is a very small amount of free NiO on the surface of catalysts. These results are well in agreement with the aforementioned XRD results, which showed the presence of NiAl2O4 as the only Ni containing phase for all the calcined catalysts. As can be seen in Fig. 3 and Table 3, the peak maximum recorded for the high-temperature peak shifted towards a lower temperature by about 30 °C for NiAl_G2 and NiAl_C, indicating that these two catalysts are more reducible than NiAl_G1. There could be two possible reasons why the high-temperature reduction peak for the NiAl_G2 and NiAl_C catalysts shifted to lower values in comparison to that of NiAl_G1. First, the reduction of NiAl2O4 might be promoted by H2 spillover effect on Ni0 species formed over the surface of NiAl_G2 and NiAl_C upon the reduction of NiO species at the temperature range of 400−500 °C. H2 spillover, which is a well-known phenomenon in supported metal catalysts such as Ni, can facilitate the reduction of catalyst support [31–33]. Second, more Ni2+ ions might be kept at octahedral sites by using two-step calcination method for NiAl_G2 and NiAl_C. According to literature [21–23], Ni2+ ions occupy both tetrahedral (NiT 2+) and octahedral (NiO 2+) sites of NiAl2O4 structure. The nickel ions in tetrahedral sites tend to move below the surface and are more shielded than the ones in octahedral sites. Hence, NiT 2+ and NiO 2+ correspond respectively to “hard to reduce” and “easy to reduce” nickel. It is also worth noting that nickel distribution between tetrahedral and octahedral sites is highly influenced by the thermal treatment (calcination) step. Bearing these facts in mind, it might be argued that using the two-step calcination method resulted in the formation of more “easy to reduce” nickel than “hard to reduce” one for NiAl_G2 and NiAl_C, whereas using one-step calcination method (only air) led to the formation of more “hard to reduce” nickel than “easy to reduce” one in the case of NiAl_G1. By comparing NiAl_G2 and NiAl_C catalysts, the former one showed a slightly lower maximum peaks, as well as a bit higher amounts of H2 consumption for the detected species. These results confirm the higher reducibility of NiAl_G2 compared to NiAl_C. It can be ascribed to the more developed porous structure and higher surface area of NiAl_G2, which can provide a greater dispersion of nickel active sites and/or an easier access of H2 to the nickel active sites. Concerning the Ce/NiAl_G2 catalyst, two characteristic peaks can be observed. The first reduction peak, which is a low intensity broad reduction peak in the temperature range of 300–600 °C centered at 435.7 °C, may correspond to both the elimination of the surface oxygen atoms on the small CeO2 crystallites and reduction of free NiO. The other reduction peak that is a strong peak located at 825.84 °C may be assigned to the reduction of NiAl2O4, simultaneous reduction of CeO2 surface and formation of CeAlO3, and reduction of bulk CeO2 [3]. The amount of H2 consumption detected at high temperature was much higher than that of low temperature. XPS analysis of the calcined and reduced NiAl_G catalysts offered valuable information about the oxidation state and the surface composition of nickel species. The XPS spectra of Ni 2p3/2 core level for the calcined catalysts are displayed in Fig. 4 , and the binding energies of Ni 2p3/2, O 1s, and Al 2p core levels are summarized in Table 4 . The Ni 2p3/2 peak exhibits a good symmetry in both samples, thereby proving the presence of one single type of Ni2+ species. This peak was attributed to Ni2+ ions in the structure of NiAl2O4 spinel [34,35]. Although Ni2+ ions are mainly in the form of NiAl2O4 structure for both catalysts, the binding energy of Ni 2p3/2 level in NiAl_G1 is higher than that of NiAl_G2. To discuss this matter further, the reduced samples were also analyzed using the XPS technique. Fig. 5 shows that the Ni 2p3/2 XPS spectra of the reduced NiAl_G1 and NiAl_G2 catalysts is deconvoluted into two peaks at ∼ 852.5 and 855.70, which respectively correspond to the Ni0 and Ni2+ species [36,37]. The ratio of the Ni0 peak area to the entire Ni peak area can be postulated as the surface reduction degree. As listed in Table 5 , the surface reduction degree of the reduced NiAl_G2 catalyst is higher than that of the reduced NiAl_G1 catalyst, 26 % for NiAl_G2 vs. 17 % for NiAl_G1. It can therefore be inferred that NiAl_G2 had retained a higher reducibility than NiAl_G1. This result is consistent with the H2-TPR results. The morphological characteristics of (Ni,Al)-Glycerate precipitate before and after two-step calcination (NiAl_G2 catalyst) were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As depicted in Fig. 6 , both samples exhibit almost the same morphology, a very well-defined platelet structure. This figure suggests that the initial morphological features of (Ni,Al)-Glycerate precipitate were maintained along the calcination treatment. The conservation of initial morphology during the calcination stage has already been reported for some metal oxides prepared by calcination of their alkoxides [38]. To verify whether the (Ni,Al)-Glycerate precipitate is a mixed-metal alkoxide, the distribution of elements was studied by EDS technique. The obtained results show that the distribution of Ni and Al are quite even and the Ni/Al ratio of (Ni,Al)-Glycerate precipitate almost coincides with that of initial solution. It can therefore be said that the (Ni,Al)-Glycerate precipitate was a mixed-metal alkoxide and not a mixture of pure Ni and Al alkoxides. TEM analysis was further used to study the morphology and the Ni0 particle size distribution of the reduced catalysts. TEM representative images, as well as the Ni0 particle size distributions, are displayed in Fig. 7 and the average Ni0 particle sizes are summarized in Table 6 . As can be seen in Fig. 7, the synthesis of NiAl2O4 catalyst from the (Ni,Al)-Glycerate precursor led to the enhancement of porous structure development, as reflected in the values of specific surface areas (Table 2). It is also noteworthy to mention that the NiAl_G2 catalyst shows a more uniform Ni0 particle size distribution than NiAl_G1 and NiAl_C. In the case of CeO2-promoted NiAl_G2 catalyst, a more homogeneous distribution of smaller particles is observed. This result suggests that the Ni sintering under high-temperature conditions was strongly inhibited because of the interaction between the Ni particles and the surrounding CeO2 and/or CeAlO3 particles. As listed in Table 6, the calculated average Ni0 particle sizes are in close agreement with the average crystallite sizes estimated from the XRD results (Table 1). The Ce/NiAl_G2 catalyst shows the smallest Ni0 particle size of 13.75 nm and almost the most homogeneous Ni0 particle size distribution among all prepared catalysts."
7,Catalytic activity in steam reforming of glycerol,"3.2 Catalytic activity in steam reforming of glycerol All SRG tests were performed under the following conditions: T = 630 °C, P =1 atm, W/G = 9, and glycerol solution to argon molar ratio = 1. These operating conditions were selected in accordance to the optimal conditions predicted from thermodynamic analysis of SRG reaction for hydrogen production [39,40]. Prior to the evaluation of the catalytic performance of the developed materials, a blank test was performed to study the conversion of glycerol under the abovementioned conditions in the absence of catalyst. As shown in Table 7 , both glycerol conversion into gaseous products and hydrogen yield were quite low in the blank test (XGlycerol-gas = 27.84 % and H2 yield = 11.17 %). In the absence of catalyst, both glycerol and liquid oxygenated hydrocarbons generated during the thermal decomposition of glycerol could not be easily converted into gaseous products. As a result, high values of 11.77 and 38.59 % were obtained for the unconverted glycerol and glycerol conversion into liquid products, respectively. More detailed information on the blank test can be found in Table 7. The carbon balance between the total number of moles of carbon in the input and output streams of the reactor was determined as described in the experimental procedure. For all the catalytic tests presented in this study, a carbon balance error of less than 5 % was obtained, indicating a high accuracy in the measurements and elemental balance analysis. However, the carbon balance error determined in the case of blank test was larger (around 20 %), which might be attributed to the possibility of the formation of some liquid products during the blank test that could not be detected by GC and HPLC analysis. 3.2.1 Influence of synthesis method on the catalytic performance of NiAl2O4 spinel in SRG Fig. 8 (a) illustrates the average values of total glycerol conversion, glycerol conversion into gaseous products, and H2 yield for the NiAl_G1, NiAl_G2, and NiAl_C catalysts. The catalytic activity reached the steady state after 30 min for all the investigated catalysts and remained stable during 4 h of operation. Therefore, the average results at the steady state were used for the comparison of developed catalysts. As can be seen, all catalysts show a very high total glycerol conversion: 97.43, 100, and 95.28 % for the NiAl_G1, NiAl_G2, and NiAl_C catalysts, respectively. However, in terms of glycerol conversion into gaseous products, the NiAl_G2 catalyst exhibits a high value of 95.42 %, whilst the values are much lower for NiAl_G1 (79.88 %) and NiAl_C (87.35 %). Considering the H2 yield, a similar trend is observed. While a high value of 76.38 % was obtained in the case of NiAl_G2, NiAl_G1 and NiAl_C provided much lower values of 58.56 % and 65.40 %, respectively. Fig. 8(b) and (c) show, respectively, the gas products selectivity and the molar ratios of H2/CO and CO2/CO for the above-mentioned catalysts. The gas phase mainly consists of H2, CO2, CO, and small amounts of CH4 and heavier hydrocarbons (C2+) for all catalysts, although the products selectivity is a function of catalyst. As can be seen, both H2/CO and CO2/CO molar ratios decrease in the following order: NiAl_G2 > NiAl_C > NiAl_G1, indicating that the NiAl_G2 catalyst has a higher activity in the WGS reaction. Moreover, the NiAl_G2 catalyst shows a lower selectivity towards CH4 and C2+ compared to NiAl_G1 and NiAl_C, suggesting that NiAl_G2 possesses a higher catalytic activity in the steam reforming of intermediates produced during the thermal decomposition of glycerol. According to these results, it is obvious that the activity of the developed NiAl2O4 catalysts in both SRG and WGS reactions decreases in the following order: NiAl_G2 > NiAl_C > NiAl_G1, which is in accordance with the H2-TPR results discussed in detail in Section 3.1. Analyzing the liquid products provides important information about the reaction pathways in SRG process. The glycerol conversion into liquid products and the liquid products selectivity (dry glycerol-free basis) for the NiAl2O4 catalysts prepared by different methods are summarized in Table 8 . As can be seen, the NiAl_G2 catalyst shows the lowest value of glycerol conversion into liquid products (0.92 %) compared to NiAl_G1 (14.52 %) and NiAl_C (3.45 %). Being the most reducible of the three synthesized NiAl2O4 materials and therefore having the largest amount of metallic Ni after reduction, NiAl_G2 promoted better the conversion of glycerol into gaseous products compared to the NiAl_G1 and NiAl_C catalysts. The main liquid products detected for these catalysts were acetaldehyde, acetic acid, acetone, acrolein, allyl alcohol, dihydroxyacetone, ethylene glycol, formaldehyde, glyceraldehyde, hydroxyacetone, methanol, 1,2-propanediol, and ethanol. Based on these products and referring to the existing literature [3,4,41–46], three main reaction pathways can be proposed for glycerol conversion in SRG reaction (Fig. 9 ). In the first pathway, ethylene glycol was produced as a common product by glycerol dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis. Ethylene glycol was then converted to acetaldehyde and ethanol. The dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of glycerol also produced glyceraldehyde and methanol, respectively. In the second pathway, the activation of the terminal OH of glycerol on the Lewis acid sites led to glycerol dehydration to hydroxyacetone (acetol) [46]. This reaction pathway could be simultaneously accomplished through the conversion of hydroxyacetone to various products including formaldehyde, 1,2-propanediol, acetone, acetaldehyde, and acetic acid. In the third pathway, the glycerol dehydration to acrolein was caused by the protonation of the secondary OH of glycerol on the Brønsted acid sites [46]. The detected products verifying this pathway were allyl alcohol, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, and methanol. These results constitute proof of the presence of acidic sites on the surface of the synthesized NiAl2O4 catalysts. According to literature [41,43,44], the glycerol dehydration and hydrogenation reactions are favored by the acidity of catalyst surface. In considering the liquid products selectivity, acetone was the main product identified for the NiAl_G2 and NiAl_C catalysts with selectivity values of 57.85 % and 42.07 %, respectively. These values are considerably higher than that reported for the NiAl_G1 catalyst (25.82 %). On the other hand, glyceraldehyde, dihydroxyacetone, and hydroxyacetone were identified only for the NiAl_G1 catalyst; with selectivity values of 19.58 %, 14.03 %, and 11.00 %, respectively. Considering the reforming pathways for glycerol, acetone is one of the liquid products obtained near the end of the reaction pathways, while glyceraldehyde, dihydroxyacetone, and hydroxyacetone can be obtained during the first steps of the reaction pathways in glycerol reforming. These results confirm that while the formation of liquid products was more favorable over the NiAl_G1 catalyst, the GSR process was shifted towards final liquid intermediates and gaseous products over the other two catalysts, particularly NiAl_G2. In order to investigate the coke formation over NiAl_G1, NiAl_G2, and NiAl_C, the used catalysts (after 4 h of reaction) were investigated by TGA, TEM, and Raman spectroscopy. As can be seen in Fig. 10 (a), the used NiAl_G2 catalyst shows about 10 wt.% weight loss in the temperature range of 450−650 °C with a maximum weight loss percentage/°C ratio at 582 °C. For the used NiAl_C catalyst, a total weight loss of around 5 wt.% was observed in the temperature range of 450−650 °C with a maximum weight loss percentage/°C ratio at 600 °C. In the case of NiAl_G1 catalyst, a very small weight loss was noticed, which makes the determination of the temperature corresponding to maximum weight loss percentage/°C ratio difficult. According to the literature [3,42], high temperature peaks (above 450 °C) are assigned to the oxidation of graphitic carbon species. Moreover, the higher the graphitic ordering of carbon deposits, the higher the oxidation temperature. Considering the temperatures for the maximum weight loss percentage/°C ratios, the graphitic ordering of carbon deposits detected on the used NiAl_G2 catalyst is lower than that observed for the used NiAl_C catalyst. From the TGA results displayed in Fig. 10(a), the rate of coke formation was calculated and shown in Fig. 10(b). It is obvious that the rate of coke formation for NiAl_G2 (0.026 gcoke gcat −1 h−1) is much higher compared to NiAl_G1 and NiAl_C (0.002 and 0.014 gcoke gcat −1 h−1, respectively). This behavior can be attributed to the presence of a higher number of Ni0 active sites on the NiAl_G2 catalyst. It is a well-known fact that coke formation needs more Ni0 active sites than steam reforming [47,48]. Therefore, the higher number of Ni0 active sites promoted both steam reforming and coke formation over the NiAl_G2 catalyst. Ni0 particles are closely involved in the formation of filamentous carbon through a nucleation-growth mechanism. According to Fig. 10(c), the TEM images reveal the formation of filamentous carbon on the surface of the used NiAl_G2 and NiAl_C. Fig. 11 shows the Raman spectra of the used NiAl_G1, NiAl_G2, and NiAl_C catalysts after 4 h of reaction. For NiAl_G2 and NiAl_C, two characteristic peaks can be observed. The first one is located at around 1345 cm−1 (D-band) and attributed to the disordered structural form of crystalline carbon species. The other peak is found at around 1580 cm−1 and associated with the graphitic carbon with high degree of crystallinity, order, and symmetry. The relative intensity of the D- and G-bands (ID/IG) provides valuable information regarding the degree of crystallinity of carbon deposits formed during SRG. Smaller ID/IG values indicate higher crystallinity because of the higher contribution of the graphitized carbon [44,49,50]. The ID/IG was 1.30 for NiAl_G2 and 1.07 for NiAl_C, showing that the degree of crystallinity was more pronounced for the NiAl_C catalyst. Therefore, the carbon formed during SRG reaction over NiAl_C is harder to remove by oxidation reaction. In the case of NiAl_G1, no Raman spectra with a sufficient signal to noise ratio was obtained due to the presence of a very small amount of coke deposition. These results are in good agreement with the TGA results discussed previously. In conclusion, it is clear that among the three investigated catalysts, the NiAl2O4 catalyst prepared by two-step calcination of (Ni,Al)-Glycerate is the most active one in SRG to produce hydrogen. According to our previous work [51], the addition of CeO2 at a small loading (ca. 10 wt.%) can effectively decrease the rate of coke formation during SRG reaction. Therefore, a comprehensive study was further performed to investigate the effect of CeO2 addition on the catalytic performance of NiAl_G2 catalyst. 3.2.2 Influence of CeO2 addition on the catalytic performance of NiAl_G2 catalyst in SRG Fig. 12 (a) compares the average values of total glycerol conversion, glycerol conversion into gaseous products, and H2 yield for the NiAl_G2 and Ce/NiAl_G2 catalysts. Although the total glycerol conversion is 100 % for both catalysts, the Ce/NiAl_G2 catalyst shows lower values of glycerol conversion into gaseous products and H2 yield compared to NiAl_G2. This behavior might be attributed to the segregation of some cerium species on the surface of nickel atoms, which made a portion of nickel active sites hard to access [23,26,51–53]. In order to discuss further about the influence of CeO2 addition on the catalytic properties of NiAl_G2, the gas products selectivity and the molar ratios of H2/CO and CO2/CO are illustrated in Fig. 12(b) and (c). As can be seen in Fig. 12(b), there are some differences in the selectivity values of the detected gaseous products. The C2+ selectivity increases from 2.70 % to 5.04 % with the addition of CeO2, suggesting that the addition of CeO2 decreases the CC bond breaking capacity of NiAl_G2. It can be attributed to the segregation of some cerium species at the surface of nickel atoms, which lowers the number of accessible nickel active sites. From Fig. 12(c), one can see that the addition of cerium to the NiAl_G2 catalyst increases both H2/CO and CO2/CO molar ratios. According to literature [3,25,26,54], the presence of cerium species in close contact with the nickel species promotes the WGS reaction, thus increasing the H2/CO and CO2/CO molar ratios. The influence of CeO2 addition on the glycerol conversion into liquid products and the liquid products selectivity (dry glycerol-free basis) is presented in Table 9 . The glycerol conversion into liquid products for the Ce/NiAl_G2 catalyst is six times higher than that for NiAl_G2. This result is another indication of the segregation of some cerium species at the surface of nickel atoms, which leads to a decrease in the CC bond breaking capacity by lowering the number of accessible nickel active sites. By using the liquid products selectivity shown in Table 9 and adding up the selectivity values of the liquid products corresponding to the reaction pathways shown in Fig. 9, the total selectivity for the pathway II is significantly higher than those for the other two pathways. Considering the liquid products selectivity reported for NiAl_G2 (Table 8), the same trend can be observed after adding up the selectivity values for each pathway. Therefore, it can be argued that the pathway II is the dominant pathway for glycerol conversion in SRG reaction over both NiAl_G2 and Ce/NiAl_G2 catalysts. It is however worth mentioning that the Ce/NiAl_G2 catalyst exhibits a remarkably lower total selectivity value for the pathway II compared to NiAl_G2, namely 48.40 % (the sum of selectivity of acetone and acetol) vs. 77.9 % (the sum of selectivity of acetone, acetol, and 1,2-propandiol), without considering the common products that can be produced in more than one pathway. As pointed out earlier, this pathway is initiated by the activation of the terminal OH of glycerol on the Lewis acid sites, which account for the strong acid sites of the catalysts [46]. On the basis of these considerations, one may say that the surface acidity decreased after the addition of CeO2 to NiAl_G2. In order to investigate the effect of CeO2 addition on coke formation, the used Ce/NiAl_G2 catalyst was examined by TGA, TEM, and Raman spectroscopy, and the obtained result was compared with that for the used NiAl_G2. As can be seen in Figs. 11 and 13 , carbon formation was almost completely suppressed by the addition of CeO2 to the NiAl_G2 catalyst. As revealed by XRD analysis, a highly dispersed CeAlO3 phase was formed on the Ce/NiAl_G2 catalyst during the reduction stage. The CeAlO3 phase possesses the ability to impede the growth of filamentous carbon on nickel surface. The presence of active oxygen atoms on the CeAlO3 surface creates an oxidative environment around the nickel active sites and therefore, the carbon atoms can be immediately gasified before the nucleation and growth stages [3,55]. 3.2.3 Catalytic stability of Ce/NiAl_G2 In order to investigate the stability of Ce/NiAl_G2, a SRG experiment was performed for 16 h under the following conditions: T =630 °C, P =1 atm, W/G = 9, and glycerol solution to argon molar ratio = 1. As can be seen in Fig. 14 , the values of glycerol conversion into gaseous products, H2 yield, and gaseous products selectivity are quite constant over 16 h on stream. Moreover, Table 9 shows that the glycerol conversion into liquid products and liquid products selectivity are similar to those obtained during 4 h of SRG reaction. These results imply the promising stability of Ce/NiAl_G2 over 16 h of SRG reaction. Fig. 15 (a) and (b) show the results of TGA analysis for the used Ce/NiAl_G2 catalyst after 16 h of reaction. Considering the weight loss of 0.6 wt.% detected in the range of 450−600 °C and 16 h as time on stream, the rate of coke formation is as low as 0.0004 gcoke gcat −1 h−1. Moreover, the carbon deposits were oxidized at a lower temperature in the case of Ce/NiAl_G2 (∼536 °C) compared with NiAl_G2 (∼580 °C), indicating the cooperative effect of CeO2 in the gasification of carbon deposits and/or the less graphitic nature of the carbonaceous species formed in the presence of CeO2 [51,56]. To further investigate the nature of carbon deposits, the used Ce/NiAl_G2 catalyst was also analyzed by TEM and Raman spectroscopy. As can be seen in Fig. 15(c), only few filamentous carbon was found after a much more detailed and meticulous analysis. In addition, the Raman spectra of Ce/NiAl_G2 shown in Fig. 16 is characterized by a small and broad peak ranging from 1275 to 1525 cm−1, which confirms the presence of a very small amount of carbon species with low degree of graphitization."
8,Conclusion,"The present study dealt with the development of a highly active and stable nickel-based catalyst for SRG reaction by employing two approaches: (i) embedding Ni in a more easily reducible NiAl2O4 spinel with a highly porous structure and (ii) introducing CeO2 as a promoter into NiAl2O4 spinel. The major findings of this work can be summarized as follows: 1 A novel method was developed for the synthesis of NiAl2O4 spinel. In this method, a Ni-Al mixed-metal alkoxide was firstly obtained by a solvothermal method and subsequently subjected to a thermal treatment through one- or two-step calcination techniques. 2 The effect of preparation method on the physicochemical properties of NiAl2O4 spinel and its catalytic performance in SRG was investigated. Three NiAl2O4 spinel catalysts were prepared by one-step calcination of Ni-Al mixed-metal alkoxide, two-step calcination of Ni-Al mixed-metal alkoxide, and conventional co-precipitation method followed by two-step calcination technique. Among these catalysts, the NiAl2O4 spinel prepared by two-step calcination of Ni-Al mixed-metal alkoxide showed the highest catalytic activity towards SRG reaction for hydrogen production. The characterization results showed that the NiAl_G2 catalyst was more readily reducible and possessed a more developed porous structure with a higher surface area. 3 In order to decrease the rate of carbon deposition, 10 wt.% of CeO2 was added into the NiAl2O4 catalyst prepared by two-step calcination of Ni-Al mixed-metal alkoxide. The TGA results showed that coke formation was suppressed to a large extent by the addition of CeO2. The formation of a well-dispersed CeAlO3 phase hindered the growth of filamentous carbon on nickel surface and enhanced the gasification of carbon deposits by providing an oxidative environment around nickel active sites. 4 To assess the stability of Ce/NiAl_G2, a SRG test was carried out for 16 h. The obtained results revealed that the catalytic activity was retained over 16 h of SRG reaction and the rate of coke formation was as low as 0.0004 gcoke gcat −1 h−1. These results confirm the high potential of Ce/NiAl_G2 as catalyst for SRG reaction."
