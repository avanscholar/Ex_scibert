0,Introduction,"Using solar energy to achieve the conversion and utilization of renewable energy is a major scientific challenge facing the world today [1–4]. The ultimate goal of breaking through this scientific challenge is to achieve hydrogen energy as the main energy source in the future [5,6]. In recent years, the using of photocatalytic water-splitting to produce hydrogen has attracted the extensive attention [7–10]. In this context, the preparation of catalytic materials is particularly important. With the extension and application of graphene, C3N4 and other layered materials in the field of photocatalysis, it has been found that the edge of layered materials have many active sites for catalytic reactions [11,12]. During the whole photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction process, e− is coupled with H+ at the active sites to form hydrogen. Therefore, the migration rate of electrons and the number of active sites are important factors to affect the catalytic activity of photocatalysts [13,14]. Recently, MoSx has attracted wide attention in the field of photocatalysis due to its high activity and earth-abundance [15–17]. Studies have shown that the active sites for hydrogen evolution of MoSx are mainly determined by its unsaturated sulfur [18]. Unsaturated sulfur atoms are only on the edge of MoSx [19]. According to literature, unsaturated sulfur atoms exposed on the edge of MoSx are easily bonded to H+ in solution and finally electron-reduced to form hydrogen [20]. Since, the catalytic activity of two-dimensional MoSx nanosheets is related to the number of active unsaturated sulfur atoms on the edge [21,22]. However, there are Van der Waals forces between the two dimensional MoSx nanosheets, where Van der Waals forces stack the MoSx nanosheets on top of each other so that the unsaturated sulfur atoms at the edges are covered [23] Therefore, it is particularly important to suppress interlayer stacking, increase the amount of unsaturated sulfur and shorten the electron transport path by changing the morphology of molybdenum sulfide [24,25]. Hence, in this experiment, we controllably synthesized MoSx with three-dimensional nanoflower structure by adding polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The three-dimensional flower structure of MoSx is assembled by two-dimensional nanosheets, which effectively avoids stacking between nanosheets and exposes more active sites. The nanoflower structure effectively shortens the electron transport path and exposes the unsaturated Mo atoms and S atoms at the edges. These unsaturated atoms also promote the edge activity of sulfur, thus acting as active sites [26,27]. Finally, MoSx showed prominent Photocatalytic evolution hydrogen activity in the dye-sensitized system. However, the recombination of photogenerated carriers is still inevitable in the reaction process, which is one of the reasons why MoSx cannot fully exert its catalytic activity. Generally, the construction of a heterojunction photocatalyst is an effective method for extending the light absorption range and improving the efficiency of carrier separation [28,29]. In particular, in recent years, researchers have found that constructing p-n heterojunction photocatalysts can provide an internal electric field between p-type and n-type semiconductors. Such interfacial electric field can greatly improve the insufficient regulation of photogenerated carriers in the design of catalysts in the past [30,31]. Under the action of the internal electric field, the photogenerated electrons and holes in the p-type and n-type semiconductors migrate to the conduction band (CB) of the n-type semiconductor and the valence band (VB) of the p-type semiconductor [32], which greatly promotes the separation and migration of electron-hole pairs. Therefore, the construction of p-n heterojunction is particularly necessary to accelerate spatial separation of charges and enhance photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. As a p-type semiconductor, CoWO4 has the advantages of narrow band gap and easy excitation by visible light [33]. In addition, sufficient thermal stability, good quantum size effect, and excellent catalytic performance have caused CoWO4 to attract widespread attention and research in the field of photocatalysis [34,35]. Hence, in order to suppress the recombination of n-type MoSx photo generated carriers CoWO4 nanoparticles are anchored in situ on the surface of MoSx by hydrothermal method. The p-n heterostructure MoSx/CoWO4 is successfully constructed. The loading of p-type semiconductor CoWO4 nanoparticles on n-type MoSx produces a large number of nano p-n heterojunctions between then. This artificial p-n heterojunction design can more effectively use the internal electric field to promote carriers separation and thus accelerate the generation of H2."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation of MoSx,"2.1 Preparation of MoSx Typically, 1.75 g (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and 3.8 g H2NCSNH2 were added into 60 mL of deionized water and stirred at room temperature to achieve a homogeneous solution. Next, 1.25 g polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was added into the above solution. Afterword, the homogeneous solution was transferred to 80 mL Teflon-lined reaction kettle and maintained at 200 ℃ for 24 h. After the reaction finished, the precipitate obtained by centrifugal separation was rinsed with anhydrous ethanol and deionized water for several times. The product was collected after drying at 70 ℃."
3,Preparation of p-n heterojunction photocatalyst MoSx/CoWO4,"2.2 Preparation of p-n heterojunction photocatalyst MoSx/CoWO4 First, 200 mg MoSx was placed into 20 mL of deionized water and then placed in ultrasound for one hour. Second, 0.0647 g C4H6CoO4·4H2O and 0.059 g NaWO4 (molar ratio = 1:1) were dissolved in 30 mL of deionized water under constant stirring for 20 min. Finally, the above two solutions were transferred into a 80 mL Teflon-lined reaction kettle and heated at 160 ℃ for 12 h in an oven. After the reaction, the washing and collecting method of the precipitate was consistent with MoSx. The prepared sample is denoted as MoSx/CoWO4-40 (40%wt CoWO4). The other samples were labeled as MoSx/CoWO4-X (with 10, 20, 30, 50, 60 wt% of CoWO4), which the different content of CoWO4 can be achieved by adjusting the amount of C4H6CoO4·4H2O and NaWO4. Additionally, pure CoWO4 was synthesized consistent with the above method (see Scheme 1 )."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations The morphology and microstructure of MoSx, CoWO4 and MoSx/CoWO4 were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6701F, JEOL, 50 kV) and field emission transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM1200EX, JEOL, 100 kV). The element composition, valence state and optical properties of the samples were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250 xi) and ultraviolet visible diffuse reflection spectrum (UV-2550 shimadzu). The crystal structures of samples were investigated via taking a Cu Kα X-ray diffractometer (XRD). The specific surface areas, pore volume and average pore size of the samples were measured at 77 K with an ASAP 2020 M instrument. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra of the samples were detected on the FluoroMAX-4 spectrometer (Horiba, France). The photoelectrochemical analysis was carried out on an electrochemical analyzer (VersaStat4-400, Advanced Measurement Technology, Inc) equipped with standard three-electrode batteries, which was consist of a Pt sheet as a pair of electrodes, a calomel electrode as a reference electrode, and a working electrode made of FTO conductive glass (impregnation surface 1 cm2). The electrolyte was 0.2 M Na2SO4. A 300 W xenon lamp was employed as light source."
5,Photocatalytic performance,"2.4 Photocatalytic performance The photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction was carried out in a multi-channel reaction system (PCX50A Discover) equipped with a 5 W LED as light source. The reaction container is 63 mL quartz bottle. Typically, 0.01 g catalyst and 0.02 g Eosin Y (EY) were dispersed 30 mL 15% triethanolamine (TEOA) aqueous solution (pH = 10). Prior to illumination, nitrogen was pumped into the reaction bottle to expel other gas to ensure that the reaction takes place under anaerobic condition. Subsequently, the reaction bottle was placed in a nine-channel reaction system to evolve hydrogen. The amount of H2 evolution was analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (TCD, 13Xcolumn, Ar as carrier)"
6,Results and discussion,
7,XRD analysis,"3.1 XRD analysis The crystalline phases of CoWO4, MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4-X (20, 40, 60) were analyzed by XRD. In Fig. 1 A, the XRD pattern of CoWO4 exhibits diffraction peaks at 18.95°, 24.47°, 30.61°, 36.40°, 41.29°, 52.06°, 54.10°, 65.06° and 71.59° which are corresponded to (1 0 0), (1 1 0), (1 1 1), (0 2 1), (1 0 2), (1 3 0), (2 2 1), (2 3 1) and (3 0 2) crystal faces of CoWO4 (PDF#72–479). The clear and sharp diffraction peaks indicate that CoWO4 has good crystallinity and no other impurities. Similarly, the peak position of MoSx in Fig. 1B matches well with the standard cards (Mo15S19 PDF#40-936, Mo2S3 PDF#65-6963) [36]. All the peaks show obvious broadening and shortening, indicating that MoSx with good layered structure have smaller average particle size and more active sites, which may be one of the reasons for the good catalytic activity of MoSx. In the spectrum, the diffraction peaks of Mo15S19 at 12.27° and 18.44° match the crystal planes of (1 0 1) and (0 1 3). Meanwhile, other diffraction peaks are located at 32.48°, 35.24°, 43.07° and 57.66°, which correspond to the (1 0 2), ( −1 1 1), ( −1 1 3) and (3 1 1) crystal planes of Mo2S3, respectively. The characteristic diffraction peaks of MoSx/CoWO4 are shown in Fig. 1C. The characteristic diffraction peaks of two pure substances appear in the composite material. With the increase of loading of CoWO4, the characteristic peaks of CoWO4 tend to increase gradually in the composite material, while the characteristic peak of MoSx appears to be lower and lower. Therefore, the MoSx/CoWO4 composite photocatalyst is successfully constructed."
8,SEM and TEM analysis,"3.2 SEM and TEM analysis SEM and TEM are important means to study the morphology of samples. As depicted in Fig. 1A, pure MoSx exhibits the structure of 3D nanoflowers and its diameter is about 300–400 nm. It can be clearly seen from the Fig. 2 A that nanoflowers are composed of many smooth nanosheets. However, different from the 2D nanosheets structure, the 3D nanoflowers structure avoids the superposition of the nanosheets, which can expose more edge active sites. Furthermore, this 3D nanoflowers structure have good advantages in the adsorption of EY and the adhesion of nanoparticles. Fig. 2B shows that CoWO4 nanoparticles are evenly grown on the surface of MoSx nanoflowers. Combined with Fig. 2(C–E), the richly layered structure of MoSx not only provides attachment sites for CoWO4, but also has a good dispersing effect on CoWO4. It can be seen from Fig. 2E that CoWO4 nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed on the MoSx surface by the nanoflowers structure, while other CoWO4 nanoparticles exist in the form of agglomeration. From the HRTEM images in Fig. 2 (F–G), it can be clearly seen that there are lattice fringes with lattice spacing of 0.731 and 0.479 nm, which correspond to the (1 0 1) and (0 1 3) planes of Mo15S19 respectively. In addition, lattice fringe with spacing of 0.275 nm can be observed in the Fig. 2F, which corresponds to the ( −1 1 1) plane of Mo2S3. The above analysis results are consistent with the XRD analysis results, which means that the MoSx exists in the form of multiple molybdenum sulfide. In Fig. 2G, the close contact interface between CoWO4 and MoSx can be clearly observed, which means the formation of heterojunction between p-type CoWO4 and n-type MoSx. Among them, lattice fringe with lattice spacing of 0.246 nm can be observed in the bright region corresponding to the (0 2 1) plane of CoWO4, which is consistent with XDR results. The formation of heterojunction plays a vital role in accelerating electron transfer. By analyzing the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) image (Fig. 2H), it can be seen that Mo, S, Co, W and O elements exist in MoSx/CoWO4-40 heterojunction photocatalyst."
9,XPS analysis,"3.3 XPS analysis The surface chemical composition and element valence state of MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4 photocatalyst were characterized by XPS. The XPS spectrum of MoSx/CoWO4 in Fig. 3 A shows that Mo, S, Co, W and O exist on the surface of sample. Fig. 3B display the Mo 3d spectrum of pure MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4. The Mo 3d spectrum for both pure MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4 present three doublet peaks indicating that there are three Mo species with different chemical states: Mo4+, Mo5+ and Mo6+. For pure MoSx, the Mo 3d spectrum present an obvious doublet peaks with electron binding energies (BE) of 228.18/231.38 eV that belonged to Mo4+ 3d [37]. Besides, a weak doublet peaks with electron BE of 232.18/235.78 eV are ascribed to Mo6+ 3d and the third doublet peaks with electron BE of 229.03/233.03 eV are likely assigned to Mo5+ 3d [38]. The weak peak at 225.33 eV is attributed to S 2 s. In Fig. 3C, the S 2p spectrum of MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4 are split into two S doublets (S2− and S2 2−). For S 2p spectrum of MoSx, the peaks at 161.03 and 162.28 eV are detected, corresponding to S2− 2p3/2 and S2− 2p1/2, respectively [23]. Meanwhile, the peaks at 163.33 and 164.43 eV are clearly observed, which can be ascribed to S2 2− 2p3/2 and S2 2− 2p1/2, respectively [39]. By analyzing Fig. 3(B–C), both binding energies of Mo 3d and S 2p of MoSx/CoWO4 shift to lower binding energy region than the original MoSx. The shift of binding energies in the spectra indicate that there is a strong interaction between CoWO4 and MoSx, which may be related to the existence of p-n heterojunction [40,41]. From the Fig. 3D, the peaks of Co 2p located at 781.18 (Co 2p3/2) and 797.18 eV (Co 2p1/2) [42]. At the binding energies of 786.18 and 797.18 eV, there were two satellite peaks corresponding to hydroxides and cobalt salts adsorbed on the catalyst surface [43,44]. In Fig. 3E, the peaks of W 4f can be divided into two peaks at 37.32 eV (W 4f5/2) and 35.19 eV (W 4f7/2) with the binding energies of W(VI) in WO4 2− [45]. The peak of O 1 s (Fig. 3F) is observed at the binding energies of 530.88 eV, which can be contribute to the the Co-O in CoWO4 [46]."
10,BET analysis,"3.4 BET analysis The specific surface area and pore structure of MoSx, CoWO4 and MoSx/CoWO4-40 were determined by N2 adsorption–desorption measurements. The instrument used was ASAP 2020. The BET equation is shown in formula (1): (1) V a V m a = c ( p / p ∗ ) ( 1 - p / p ∗ ) 1 + ( c - 1 ) p / p ∗ V a - the absorption amount under pressure p; V m a - the saturated adsorption capacity of monolayer; p ∗ - the saturated vapor pressure; c - Adsorption constant; As shown in Fig. 4 A–C, The the N2 adsorption-desorption curves of all samples have the characteristic of type IV adsorption-desorption isotherms. According to IUPAC classification, the hysteretic loop of the samples are type H3, which is associated with slit-like pores formed by the aggregations of the plate-like particles [47]. Table 1 also lists the specific surface area (SBET), average pore size, and pore volume of all catalysts for comparison. The specific surface areas of pure MoSx, CoWO4 and MoSx/CoWO4-40 are 13.06, 28.01 and 23.61 m2/g, respectively. The SBET of MoSx/CoWO4-40 increase significantly with the loading of CoWO4, which means the successful combination of MoSx and CoWO4. It can be seen from the pore size distribution curves that the pore size distributions of all catalysts are between 2 and 50 nm, which belongs to the division of mesoporous materials. Passing the Table 1 , the MoSx/CoWO4-40 has the smallest average pore size, which indicates that the catalysts are mutually filled by in-situ hydrothermal method. Besides, the increase of SBET of catalyst is more conducive to the adsorption of dye molecules, and the increase of pore volume is conducive to the diffusion and transfer of materials, thereby improving the photocatalytic activity [48]."
11,UV–vis DRS analysis,"3.5 UV–vis DRS analysis The optical properties of MoSx, CoWO4 and MoSx/CoWO4-40 were studied by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectrometry. In Fig. 5 A, the 3D nanoflower MoSx has obvious light absorption intensity in the near ultraviolet to near infrared region. As for CoWO4, it shows strong light absorption characteristics when the wavelength is less than 480 nm, which can be attributed to its intrinsic band absorption [49]. In the visible light region, a significant absorption peak appears at about 580 nm. This absorption peak can be interpreted as the characteristic absorption band of electron transition of d orbital in CoWO4 [50]. MoSx/CoWO4-40 exhibits strong light absorption characteristics in the same range of 200–800 nm as MoSx. Furthermore, MoSx/CoWO4-40 presents a light absorption peak at 580 nm, which also indicates a successful combination of MoSx and CoWO4. The band gap energy of CoWO4 can be calculated by the formula: (αhν)1/2 = A(hν − Eg ), where α, h, ν, Eg , and A are the absorption coef-ficient, Planck’s constant, light frequency, band gap and a constant, respectively. In Fig. 5B, the band gap of CoWO4 is 2.1 eV. Through the above analysis, it can be concluded that loading the appropriate amount of CoWO4 on MoSx can improve the utilization efficiency of visible light."
12,Photocatalytic H2 evolution performance,"3.6 Photocatalytic H2 evolution performance Under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm), the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of EY sensitized MoSx, CoWO4 and MoSx/CoWO4-X (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60) are shown in Fig. 6 . In Fig. 6A, the hydrogen production of pure MoSx in 30 mL 15% TEOA aqueous solution (pH = 10) reaches 234 μmol after 5 h under visible light irradiation. On this basis, the hydrogen production rate of MoSx reaches 4680 μmol g−1 h−1. Combined with the SEM and BET analysis results, MoSx exhibits high hydrogen production activity, which can be attributed to the following reasons. On the one hand, MoSx has a 3D nanoflower structure, which can inhibit the stacking between nano-sheets and shorten the electron transport path. At the same time, special nanoflower structures can expose high density active sites. On the other hand, a larger pore size may be more conducive to the full contact between catalyst and sacrificial reagent. In addition, MoSx exhibits strong light absorption properties, which may be one of the reasons why MoSx shows high hydrogen production activity. Conversely, it can be seen from the Fig. 6A that CoWO4 has almost no catalytic activity. However, when CoWO4 and MoSx are combined to form MoSx/CoWO4 p-n heterojunction photocatalyst, the hydrogen production activity of MoSx/CoWO4 has obvious advantages compared with pure MoSx and CoWO4. With the increase loading of CoWO4, the hydrogen production of MoSx/CoWO4-X increased first and then decreased. In Fig. 6B, when the loading of CoWO4 reaches 40%, the hydrogen production of MoSx/CoWO4-40 reaches the maximum (470 μmol). The hydrogen production rate of MoSx/CoWO4-40 reaches 9414.4 μmol g−1 h−1. For MoSx/CoWO4-X, when the loading of CoWO4 is less than 40%, the hydrogen production of MoSx/CoWO4-X increases as the CoWO4 loading increases. For the above phenomenon, it can be understood that the combination of CoWO4 and MoSx leads to the formation of the internal electric field, which accelerates the separation and migration of electron-hole pairs, thereby promoting efficient hydrogen production. Furthermore, when the CoWO4 is overloaded, a shielding effect is caused to weaken the absorption of visible light resulting in a decrease in hydrogen production activity [51,52]. The pH value of the reaction solution has an important influence on the hydrogen production activity of the catalysts. Fig. 7 (C–D) show the hydrogen production of MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4-40 at different pH values. In Fig. 7(C, D), when pH values of TEOA aqueous solution varied from 5 to 11, the hydrogen production activity of MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4-40 achieve maximized at the pH of 10 an 9, respectively. However, the hydrogen production activity of MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4 decrease significantly under the reaction conditions of under more acidic and more basic. Under acidic conditions, TEOA is easily protonated, which weakens its ability to donate electrons, resulting in lower lifetime and utilization of excited dye molecules. Eventually, the lifetime and charge utilization of excited state EY (EY*) are reduced, which led to the reduction of the hydrogen production activity of the catalyst under acidic conditions [53,54]. Besides, the H+ concentration is greatly reduced under strong basic condition, which leads to the decrease of the thermodynamic driving force of hydrogen evolution. In view of the above analysis, MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4-40 stability tests are carried out in TEOA solution with pH = 10. In order to prevent degradation of EY, we add 20 mg of EY to the reaction system after the end of each cycle and before the next cycle. In Fig. 7E–F, the hydrogen evolution activity of MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4-40 after four cycles present a significant decreasing trend. Since Min et al. previously reported that the addition amount of EY had a great vital on the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst [55,56]. In order to avoid the influence of excessive EY on the stability of the catalyst, the addition amount of EY is reduced from the initial 20 mg to 5 mg when the catalyst is tested for cycle stability again. Finally, we found that the hydrogen production activity of MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4-40 remained relatively stable after four cycles. Compared with the previous test results, the stability of MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4-40 has been greatly improved. In addition, Min et al. also reported that excessive eosin in sensitized system would cause shielding effect and thus reduce the stability of the catalyst [55,56]. Therefore, it can be concluded that the decreased hydrogen-producing activity of MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4-40 in the previous stability test is caused by the shielding effect of EY. Hence, MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4-40 have good stability. In addition, We compare the hydrogen production rates of MoSx and CoWO4 in other systems reported in the literature with our current work. The comparison results are shown in Table 2 . It can be found that the hydrogen evolution activity of MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4-40 is still higher than that reported in literature. In summary, MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4 have efficient and stable catalytic properties."
13,The PL and TRPL spectra,"3.7 The PL and TRPL spectra In order to further understand the interaction mechanism between EY and catalyst, the photoluminescence quenching of EY in the presence of the MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4-X (20, 40, 60) are examined. In Fig. 8 A, EY presents the maximum emission peak at 538 nm, which corresponds to the rebound quenching process of the EY excited state electrons. Under the irradiation of visible light, EY is excited by light, which leads to the transition of electron from ground state to excited state. Because of the short lifetime of the excited state electron, if the excited state electron can not be transferred effectively, it will fluoresce and quench in the form of a radiative transition [56]. The large number of excited electrons quenched means that the utilization of electrons during the reaction is extremely low, which results in that pure EY cannot decompose water to produce hydrogen under light. When MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4-X (20, 40, 60) are added to EY solution, the fluorescence intensity of EY decrease significantly. The above phenomenon reflects that the addition of MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4 can promote the increase of the utilization rate of EY excited state electrons. At the same time, it also indicates that there is electron migration between the excited state EY and MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4. The fluorescence quenching efficiency of EY follows the rule of MoSx/CoWO4-40 > MoSx, which is the same order as the difference of hydrogen evolution activity. Min et al. Reported that the excited state EY (EY*) potential is −3.45 ev [55]. Therefore, there is enough driving force between EY* and MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4 to facilitate the injection of electrons from EY* into MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4. Compared with MoSx, the fluorescence quenching efficiency of MoSx/CoWO4-40 on EY is the highest. Therefore, the electron migration between EY* and MoSx/CoWO4-40 is not only driven by energy level difference, but also may be related to the orientation induction of internal electric field of MoSx/CoWO4. The interaction between MoSx, MoSx/CoWO4-X (20, 40, 60) and EY was studied using transient fluorescence spectroscopy. The fitting curves of carrier life attenuation are shown in Fig. 8B. The TRPL attenuation spectrum curve of EY is fitted by a single exponential decay dynamics function (2): (2) I ( t ) = B 1 e - t / τ 1 Additionally, the other samples for MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4-X (20, 40, 60) exhibit biexponential decay. The exponential functions to fit the curves are applied, which correspond to the function (3): (3) I ( t ) = ∑ i = 1 , 2 B i exp ( - t / τ i ) I - the normalised emission intensity; t - the time after the pulsed laser excitation; B i - the amplitude (pre - exponential factor); τ i - the TPRL decay time; The fitting parameters and catalyst decay life are shown in Table 3 . In order to observe the fluorescence life of texcited electrons more intuitively, the average life is adopted as the judgment. The average life is calculated by function (4): (4) < τ > = ∑ i = 1 , 2 B i τ i 2 / ∑ i = 1 , 2 B i τ i < τ > - the average lifetime; B i - the amplitude (pre - exponential factor); τ i - the TPRL decay time; The average lifetime of EY is 1.31 ns, which is consistent with that reported by Min et al. [55,66]. When MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4 are added to EY solution, the second-order exponential fitting is needed. Among them, the average attenuation lifetime of MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4 is lower than the average attenuation lifetime of EY, which is consistent with the phenomenon reported by Zhang et al. [67–69]. The long lifetime and short lifetime for MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4 samples may respectively correspond to the lifetime of single EY and EY coupled with the MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4 samples. In addition, Zhen et al. reported that singlet excited state EY (EY1*) would not involve electron transfer [66]. It can be clearly seen that with the addition of MoSx/CoWO4, the long lifetime is increasing. This phenomenon indicates that the existence of MoSx/CoWO4 can significantly prolong the lifetime of the single excited state EY (EY1*), which will facilitate the transition from the single excited state EY (EY1*) to the triplet excited state (EY3*) and the generation of strongly reducing dye radical species (EY−). With the addition of MoSx/CoWO4, the short lifetime is gradually shortened, which means that the electrons of EY− can be quickly transferred to the active site of MoSx/CoWO4 to participate in the reaction."
14,Photoelectrochemical analysis,"3.8 Photoelectrochemical analysis The charge transfer kinetics of photocatalysts MoSx, MoSx/CoWO4-20, MoSx/CoWO4-40 and MoSx/CoWO4-60 photocatalysts were evaluated by photocurrent response (i-t), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). In Fig. 9 A, the photocurrent response curves were measured under the successive On/Off illumination cycles. It is worth noting that the photocurrent response of MoSx/CoWO4 is significantly higher than that of pure MoSx under the proper loading of CoWO4. The order of photocurrent response from high to low is as follows: MoSx/CoWO4-40 > MoSx/CoWO4-20 > MoSx > MoSx/CoWO4-60. These catalysts retain the above phenomenon after repeated light irradiation and reproduce well. Interestingly, the above rule is consistent with the hydrogen evolution performance analysis. Among them, when the loading amount of CoWO4 reaches 60%, the photocurrent response of MoSx/CoWO4-60 is lower than that of MoSx. This can be attributed to the excessive shielding effect of CoWO4, Which inhibits the absorption of light by MoSx/CoWO4-60. By analyzing the comparison results of the photocurrent response, it is found that the formation of MoSx/CoWO4 p-n heterojunction accelerates the spatial separation and migration of charge carriers [47]. Under the action of the built-in electric field, the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes in the photocatalyst is greatly improved. This means that the p-n heterojunction has a significant inhibitory effect on the recombination of photogenerated carriers [70]. This is well consists with the PL results. Besides, the resistance encountered during charge transfer is confirmed by EIS test. The arc radius of the EIS curve reflects the charge transfer rate of the working electrode and the electrolyte solution at the contact interface [41]. The smaller radius of the curve means the faster charge transfer. Obviously, the arc radius of MoSx/CoWO4-40. More efficient separation of electrons and holes and faster interface charge transfer occur under the interfacial electric field of the MoSx and CoWO4. When the load of CoWO4 reaches 60%, the impedance of heterojunction photocatalyst MoSx/CoWO4-60 is the largest. The excessive CoWO4 coating may hinder the electron transfer and lead to the decline of activity of hydrogen evolution. The electrochemical hydrogen evolution activity of catalyst is determined by linear sweep voltammetry in Fig. 9C. We measured the LSV curves of MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4-X (20, 40, 60) under light and dark conditions, respectively. In the process of cathode polarization, the cathode current density of MoSx/CoWO4-X (20, 40) is higher than that of MoSx, which is conducive to H2 formation reaction: 2H+ + 2e− = H2 [21]. Compared with dark conditions, the cathode current densities of MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4-X (20, 40, 60) increase significantly under light conditions. The above phenomena fully prove that MoSx and MoSx/CoWO4-X (20, 40, 60) have good optical response. In addition, MoSx/CoWO4-40 has the largest cathode current density under light conditions, which further illustrates that p-n heterojunctions have an important role in accelerating electron transfer. The above analysis shows that proper loading of CoWO4 is beneficial to promote the effective formation of p-n heterojunction, thus accelerating charge transfer, reducing charge recombination and improving hydrogen evolution activity of catalyst."
15,Potential reaction mechanism,"3.9 Potential reaction mechanism In order to more clearly illustrate the separation and migration mechanism of the photogenerated charges, the position of conduction band potentials (ECB) and valence band potentials (EVB) of the sample are determined. Fig. 10 A is the Mot-Schottky curves of MoSx and CoWO4. The flat band potential are evaluated by Mott -Schottky plots. Their flat band potential can be determined by equation (5): (5) 1 / C 2 = 2 ( N D e ε ε 0 ) - 1 · ( E - E fb - κ T / e ) C - the capacitance of the space charge region; N D - charge carrier concentration; e - electron charge; ε 0 - vacuum permittivity; ε - dielectric constant of MoSx and CoWO4; E - electrode applied potential; E fb - flat band potentials; T - absolute temperature; κ - Boltzmann constant; In Fig. 10A, MoSx and CoWO4 correspond to n-type semiconductor with positive slope and p-type semiconductor with negative slope, respectively [71]. As a consequence, the flat band potential (Efb) for MoSx and CoWO4 are −0.60 and 2.41 V versus SCE, respectively. It is well known that the ECB of n-type semiconductors is negative about 0.1 or 0.2 V than the Efb. By contrast, for p-type semiconductors, the EVB is more positive about 0.1 or 0.2 V than the Efb [71,72]. And thus, the ECB of MoSx and EVB of CoWO4 are roughly reckon up to be −0.80 V and 2.61 versus SCE. Under the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), the ECB and EVB of MoSx and CoWO4 are −0.56 and 2.85 V vs NHE (ENHE = ESCE + 0.241 V), respectively. Combined with band gap data of CoWO4 in Fig. 5B, the ECB of CoWO4 is computed about 0.75 V vs NHE by the equation: EVB = ECB + Eg. Since the band gap of MoSx cannot be obtained in Fig. 5B, we used XPS valence band spectrum to finally determine the ECB of MoSx. In Fig. 10B, the EVB corresponding to MoSx is finally determined to be 1.28 V vs NHE. Combined with the above calculation results, the band positions of p-type semiconductor CoWO4 and n-type semiconductor MoSx before and after contact are plotted in Fig. 11 (A–B). The Fermi level of p-type semiconductor CoWO4 is close to the valence band (VB). Interestingly, the Fermi level of n-type semiconductor MoSx is close to the conduction band (CB). Therefore, the positions of energy bands before contact of the two semiconductors are shown in Fig. 11A. The CB of MoSx is more negative and the VB of CoWO4 is more positive. When the two semiconductors are in contact, the Fermi level of MoSx is more negative than the Fermi level of CoWO4, which provides a thermodynamic pathway that promotes the transfer of electrons [73,74]. At this point, electrons in n-type semiconductor MoSx transfer to the p-type semiconductor CoWO4 surface, while holes in p-type semiconductor CoWO4 will diffuse to the MoSx surface [40]. Electrons and holes are enriched in CoWO4 and MoSx respectively until Fermi energy levels of the two semiconductors are equal. As a consequence, an internal electric field is formed between two kinds of semiconductors, which is directed by n-type semiconductor MoSx to p-type semiconductor CoWO4. Finally, the energy band structure after contact is shown in Fig. 11B. In Fig. 11B, MoSx and CoWO4 are simultaneously excited by visible light to produce photogenerated electrons and holes. Under the action of p-n heterostructure internal electric field, electrons on the CB of CoWO4 migrate to the CB of MoSx. At the same time, the holes on the VB of MoSx migrate to the VB of CoWO4. Therefore, the presence of the p-n heterojunction not only accelerates the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes but also suppresses the recombination of carriers."
16,Reaction mechanism,"3.10 Reaction mechanism Based on the above discussion, we finally conclude the possible photocatalytic reaction mechanism of p-n heterojunction photocatalyst (MoSx/CoWO4). Since MoSx is a 3D nanoflower structure, modification of CoWO4 nanoparticles on MoSx can disperse CoWO4 nanoparticles well. In addition, smaller size CoWO4 nanoparticles can shorten the charge transport distance to promote the separation of electron-hole pairs [75]. Because of the interface electric field on the contact interface, every CoWO4 nanoparticle near the coverage point can be regarded as a miniature photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells. Therefore, a certain amount of CoWO4 nanoparticles modified on layered MoSx can form a large number of miniature photoelectrochemical cells. In these miniature photoelectrochemical cells, photogenerated electrons and holes are induced to undergo directional migration. As an electron porter, EY is added to the reaction system. Because of the good 3D layered structure of MoSx/CoWO4, EY is adsorbed on the surface of CoWO4 and MoSx. EY absorbs photonsto form singlet excited state EY1*, which subsequently produces alowest-lying triplet excited state EY3* via an efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) [56]. The EY3* with a triple excited state is reduced and quenched to generate free radical EY.−, which eventually sends electrons to the CB of CoWO4 and MoSx. Under the action of the interfacial electric field, electrons in the CB of CoWO4 migrate to the CB of MoSx and eventually participate in the reduction reaction at the active site of MoSx to form H2. The electron paths provided by EY molecules are as follows {1}: { 1 } EY + h v → E Y 1* → ISC E Y 3* E Y 3* + TEOA → E Y - ∙ + TEO A + E Y - ∙ ( e - ) → (1) CoWO4 ( e - ) (2) MoSx ( e - ) (3) CoWO4 ( e - ) → MoSx ( e - ) 2 e - + 2 H 2 O → H 2 + 2 O H - Under visible light irradiation, part of the electrons that participate in the reaction with the proton come from photogenerated electrons generated by the semiconductor being excited by visible light. MoSx and CoWO4 are excited by visible light, in which photo generated electrons transition from the valence band of the two semiconductors to the conduction band while leaving photo generated holes in the conduction band. Under the influence of the internal electric field, the photogenerated electrons on the CB of CoWO4 migrate to the CB of MoSx to participate in the reduction reaction. In contrast, the photogenerated holes in the VB of MoSx migrate to the VB of CoWO4 and are eventually consumed by TEOA. The electron and hole migration paths are as follows {2} (see Fig. 12 ): { 2 } CoWO 4 + h v → CoWO 4 ( e - CB + h + VB ) MoSx + h v → MoSx( e - CB + h + VB ) CoWO 4 ( e - CB ) → MoSx( e - CB ) MoSx( h + VB ) → CoWO 4 ( h + VB ) 2 e - + 2 H 2 O → H 2 + 2 O H - CoWO 4 ( h + VB ) + TEOA → TEO A +"
17,Conclusion,"In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized MoSx with 3D nanoflower structure, which effectively inhibits interlayer stacking and exposes more active sites. On this basis, the controllable coverage of CoWO4 nanoparticles on MoSx is realized by simple hydrothermal method. The MoSx/CoWO4 p-n heterojunction photocatalyst is successfully constructed. The formation of p-n heterojunction was confirmed by X-ray diffraction(XRD), Model-Schottky (MS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XPS) analysis. Because MoSx has good photosensitivity, it can greatly promote the absorption of visible light by MoSx/CoWO4. Under the action of the internal electric field, the p-n heterojunction photocatalyst induces rapid separation and transfer of carriers, thereby promoting efficient hydrogen production. Eventually, the hydrogen production rate of MoSx/CoWO4 heterojunction photocatalyst reached 9414.4 μmol g−1 h−1. The new p-n junction photocatalyst constructed in this study is of great significance for meeting energy needs in the future."
