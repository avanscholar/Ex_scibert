0,Introduction,"Electrospinning, a broadly employed technology for non-woven fiber preparation via the electrostatic force between polymer solution and collection plate using natural and synthetic polymers as raw materials, has attracted widely attention [1]. The range of the radius of nanofibers prepared by electrospinning technique is stable relatively, usually from several nanometers to several microns. Electrospun nanofiber has many advantages such as extremely high specific surface area and porosity, wide ductility of size and shape, the controllability of the nanofiber components and the design of the nanofiber formation [2]. Electrospinning is regarded as a well-known and versatile technique to fabricate fiber materials including composite fiber, porous structure fiber, polymer fiber and so on. Electrospun polymer nanofibers have potential array of wide ranging applications such as filtration, material enhancement, insulation isolation and energy storage, etc [3,4]. The electrospun nonwoven fibrous membranes prepared with biocompatible materials are widely used in biomedical fields, such as wound dressing, artificial tissue scaffold and so on [5]. Chitosan, also named as poly N-acetyl-2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose, is a linear and semi-crystalline macromolecular polysaccharide [6]. Chitosan is one of the rare alkaline polysaccharides in nature that does not dissolve in neutral water but solubilizes in acidic aqueous solutions [7]. Chitosan has excellent biological properties, such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-toxicity, low immunogenicity and antibacterial activity [8]. Its antibacterial activity comes from the positively charged -NH2 in the chain, which could engender electrostatic interaction with anionic groups on the microorganism cell membrane, change the permeability of cell membrane and result in the decline of microbial cells [9–12]. Because of the excellent biological properties of chitosan, it has potential array of wide ranging biomedical applications such as wound healing, wound dressing, antibacterial encapsulation, tissue engineering scaffolds, separation membranes, biosensors, drug delivery, etc. [13–15]. However, chitosan due to the existence of amino groups on the chains is not electrospinnable [16]. A common approach to improve the electrospinnability of CS is to blend it with other easily-electrospinnable polymers such as Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) [17], Polyethylene oxide (PEO) [18] and Polylactic acid (PLA) [19]. PVA is usually selected as an electrospun material, because of its great water solubility, high tensile strength and flexibility. Due to the low toxicity and biocompatibility, PVA has been investigated in the medical field such as implantable medical devices, artificial pancreas, hemodialysis and drug delivery applications [20]. The graphene oxide (GO) prepared via modified Hummer’s method has low production cost and sufficient supply [21]. GO contains abundant oxygen containing functional groups, such as hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxyl and epoxy groups, on its nanosheet basal plane and edge. These functional groups interact strongly with polar solvents and polymer matrices to disperse GO better in the polymer matrix [22]. Thus, GO possesses great hydrophilicity [23]. Since GO nanosheets act as an implantable and biocompatible platform for accelerated cell growth and tissue regeneration, it could serve in widely range of biomedical applications which demand great implantable performance and biocompatibility. Thus, it is excellent to enhance the properties of chitosan without compromising its biocompatibility [24]. Besides, polymer composite materials with GO have been used widely in biomedical field due to the excellent antibacterial performance of GO towards gram positive bacteria and negative bacteria [25–27]. Electrospun fibers due to nano-scale structure are conducive to absorption of drug and permeation of water, which act as the decisive factor for wound healing effect [28]. So electrospinning is widely used in ranging biomedical applications such as wound healing, wound dressing and so on. Chitosan/PVA nanofibers have been obtained by electrospinning mixed polymeric solutions with different ratios of chitosan and PVA. Electrospun nanofibrous membrane due to its excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, low immunogenicity, antibacterial activity and cell binding capacity which could promote the healing of wound efficiently, has been used in the range of wound healing and wound dressing [29]. In this work, we proposed a strategy of fabricating CS/PVA/GO composite nanofibrous membranes with enhanced antibacterial performance. Through the proposed preparation procedure, electrospinning solution of CS/PVA/GO can be obtained and then used for the fabrication of CS/PVA/GO composite nanofibrous membranes. The morphology of the electrospun composite nanofibers was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The structure, crystallinity, thermal stability and hydrophilic property of the nanofibrous membranes were measured using attenuated total refraction Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and contact angle measurement. Additionally, the antibacterial activity of composite nanofibers against Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus was investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials CS was supplied by Zhejiang Golden-Shell Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., with a 90%–91% deacetylation degree. PVA (degree of polymerization is 1700, deacetylation degree 87%–89%) was obtained from Aladdin Industrial, Inc. Acetic acid was commercially available from Tianjin Zhiyuan Reagent Co., Ltd. Graphite powder was purchased from Qingdao Tianyuan graphite Co., Ltd. Concentrated H2SO4 was purchased from Beijing Chemical Works. Sodium nitrate was supplied by Tianjin Kermel Co., Ltd. Potassium permanganate was obtained from Tianjin Chemical Reagent Factory and H2O2 (30%) were obtained from Xilong Chemical Co., Ltd. The Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus were obtained from Guangdong culture collection center. Distilled water was used in this study. All of the materials unless otherwise stated, were of analytical grade and all of the materials were used as received without further treatment."
3,Preparation of GO dispersion,"2.2 Preparation of GO dispersion Graphene oxide was obtained by the modified Hummer’s method [30]. Dried graphite powder was stirred slowly in cold concentrated H2SO4 and then sodium nitrate was added to the suspension. Potassium permanganate was added gradually and the temperature of the mixture was controlled in the range of 12 °C–14 °C. The mixture was stirred for 4 h. Then, the temperature of mixture was reached up to 35 °C for 30 min. After that, distilled water was slowly added to the mixture with the temperature maintained in the range of 45 °C–50 °C. Afterwards, the dilute suspension was stirred at 90 °C for an additional 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of a certain amount of distilled water and 30% H2O2 solution. Gradually, the colour of the dispersion turned from dark brown to yellow. Several repeated filtration were carried out to wash the mixture using distilled water until the pH value of solution reached 6–7. Then it was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min and solid content of the sediment was determined. The GO mixed solution of 0.01 g/mL, formed by adding appropriate amount of distilled water, was treated with ultrasonic to obtain the uniform GO dispersion."
4,Preparation of electrospun CS/PVA/GO composite nanofibrous membranes,"2.3 Preparation of electrospun CS/PVA/GO composite nanofibrous membranes CS solution was prepared by dissolving 5 wt% of CS powder in distilled water with 5% w/w acetic acid. PVA powder was dissolved into distilled water at 70 °C, stirring to obtain PVA solution (5 wt%). The CS/PVA/GO electrospun precursor solutions were prepared as follows: GO dispersion (1 wt%, aqueous solution), CS solution (5 wt%) and PVA solution (5 wt%) were mixed with a certain volume. Chitosan solution was mixed with aqueous PVA solution in a weight ratio of 3:7, 2:8 and 1:9. The content of GO was 0 wt%, 1 wt%, 3 wt% and 5 wt% of CS, respectively. The electrospun precursor solution was adequately stirred but the stirring speed was not too fast, avoiding influencing the spinning process and the nanofibrous membranes forming, because of the formation of bubble in the solution. Afterwards, electrospinning process was conducted by an apparatus comprised of the following parts: a syringe, a high voltage power and a metal plate for collecting nanofibers. A 10 mL syringe with electrospun precursor solution was linked to a flat-end metal needle with inner diameter of 0.7 mm. Set up the electrospinning parameters as follows: DC voltage was 23 kV, collecting distance between needle tip and collector was 15 cm. The needle was displayed with a horizontal plane of 15° and perpendicular to the collecting plate. The electrospinning process was carried out by pushing the polymer solutions into the needle, which depended on the gravity of the electrospun precursor solutions. The whole process was undertaken at the ambient temperature of 25 °C with a relative humidity of less than 45%. After 12 h of electrospinning process, the collector with electrospun nanofibers was dried overnight at room temperature. The schematic illustration is portrayed in Fig. 1 ."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The morphology of CS/PVA/GO composite nanofibrous membranes was observed by scanning electron spectroscopy (JSM-7500F, JEOL). Prior to the analysis, the samples were coated with gold using a sputter coater. FTIR spectroscopy was used to determine the chemical functional groups of CS/PVA/GO composite nanofibrous membrane. This method was performed using TensorⅡFTIR (Bruker). The spectral range was 4000-400 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1. XRD analysis was used to determine the overall crystallinity of the composite nanofibrous membranes. The XRD patterns of membranes were obtained using D/max-2200VPC XRD (Rigaku) with a scanning rate of 5° min−1 over a 2θ range of 5°–40°. Differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) data of membranes were recorded on a Diamond DSC (Perkin-Elmer) at a heating rate of 5 °C/min under nitrogen atmosphere, and a temperature range of 40 °C–250 °C. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), determining thermal stability of composite nanofibrous membranes, was carried out on a TG 201F1 (Netzsch) at heating rate of 10 °C/min under nitrogen, and a temperature range of 40 °C–600 °C. Contact angle measurements were carried out in a JC 2000C contact angle system offered by Shanghai Zhongchen Digital Technic Apparatus Co., Ltd. A drop of water (5 μL) was deposited on the membrane surface and the drop shape was recorded by a digital camera."
6,Antibacterial activity assay,"2.5 Antibacterial activity assay Antibacterial activity of composite nanofibrous membranes was investigated against E. coli (ATCC 8739) and S. aureus (CMCC 26003) via agar disk diffusion method with the determination of the inhibition zones (mm). The plates, filled with sterilized Luria-Bertani agar medium, were inoculated with microbial strains. The samples were cut into small rectangle pieces (10 × 10 mm) and put them on the inoculated agar plates. Then the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h in an incubator. After incubation, radius of zone of inhibition formed was measured via Digimizer software."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Morphology of composite nanofibrous membranes,"3.1 Morphology of composite nanofibrous membranes SEM images of the CS/PVA/GO composite nanofibrous membranes are showed in Fig. 2 . It was obvious that CS/PVA/GO composite nanofibrous membranes were fabricated through electrospinning process. Highly uniform and smooth composite nanofibers were formed without the occurrence of bead defects for all the nanofibers. Some bulges could be detected (especially in Fig. 2F–H), which was believed to be the GO sheets [31], showing the shape of spindle and spherical. The average diameter of nanofibers was determined by measuring the diameters of 30 random selected fibers via Digimizer software. Uniform and smooth morphology of the nanofibers were obtained with a narrow diameter distribution of approximately 83 ± 10 nm. As the increasing of content of GO, the mean diameter of nanofibers increased. The amino group of chitosan was protonated in the solution, resulting in the viscous solution, and higher voltage was required to obtain the stretched jet. While the supply voltage and electric field were constant, the spinning process was more difficult and as a result, the mean diameter of the composite fibers increased."
9,Structural properties of CS/PVA/GO composite nanofibrous membrane,"3.2 Structural properties of CS/PVA/GO composite nanofibrous membrane 3.2.1 FTIR The FTIR spectra of different proportion of CS/PVA/GO composite nanofibrous membranes are showed in Fig. 3 . A showed FTIR spectra of CS/PVA with different GO, the weight ratio of CS and PVA was constant (1:9), and the weight ratio of CS and GO was different (a: CS:GO = 1:0, b: CS:GO = 1:0.01, c: CS:GO = 1:0.03, d: CS:GO = 1:0.05). Fig. 3B showed FTIR spectra of CS/PVA without GO (a: pure CS, b: CS:PVA = 3:7, c: CS:PVA = 2:8, d: CS:PVA = 1:9, e: pure PVA). Fig. 3C showed FTIR spectra of CS/PVA with GO, the weight ratio of CS and GO was constant (1:0.01), and the weight ratio of CS and PVA was different (a: CS:PVA = 3:7, b: CS:PVA = 2:8, c: CS:PVA = 1:9). In Fig. 3, the peak at 3357 cm−1 was due to the characteristic peak of OH and NH [32], where showing a broad peak. CS/PVA composites exhibited CH stretching vibration at approximately 2937cm−1 while shifting to a slightly lower wavenumber in pure chitosan [33]. In Fig. 3A, it was observed obviously that there appeared an absorption peak at 1710 cm−1 which was concerned with CO stretching vibration of carboxyl groups on the edges of GO. The CO peak (1740 cm−1) of residual ester groups of PVA weakened and OH in-plane coupled vibration peak (1327 cm−1) enhancement referred to the destruction of original hydrogen bonds of CS/PVA composites and formation of strong interaction among CS, PVA and GO, with the increasing of GO. COH, observed at 1370 cm−1, weakened with the increasing of GO due to the strong hydrogen. In Fig. 3B, the peak at 1740 cm−1 was concerned with CO bond of residual ester groups of PVA. The peak at 1652 cm−1 and 1590 cm−1 corresponded to the bending frequency of the amide I & amide II group, which shifting slightly to 1565 cm−1 in CS/PVA composites [34]. The peak at 1370 cm−1, concerned with COH stretching vibration, enhanced with the increasing of PVA. The peak of OH bending vibration was observed at 1248 cm−1 [35]. Meanwhile, the characteristic bands for saccharide structures were at 895 cm−1, 1060 cm−1 and 1152 cm−1. In Fig. 3C, there were not obvious changes on functional groups in composite system. It could be attributed to the epoxy and carboxyl groups of GO have acted with the amino groups of CS, though. The peaks of secondary amino groups and amide groups formed would be covered by the peaks of amino groups and amide groups which have existed in composite system before. 3.2.2 XRD To evaluate crystalline structure of the different proportion of CS/PVA/GO composite nanofibrous membranes, XRD curves are performed in Fig. 4 .A showed XRD curves of CS/PVA with different GO, the weight ratio of CS and PVA was constant (1:9), and the weight ratio of CS and GO was different (a: CS:GO = 1:0, b: CS:GO = 1:0.01, c: CS:GO = 1:0.03, d: CS:GO = 1:0.05). Fig. 4B showed XRD curves of CS/PVA without GO (a: pure CS, b: CS:PVA = 3:7, c: CS:PVA = 2:8, d: CS:PVA = 1:9, e: pure PVA). Fig. 4C showed XRD curves of CS/PVA with GO, the weight ratio of CS and GO was constant (1:0.01), and the weight ratio of CS and PVA was different (a: CS:PVA = 3:7, b: CS:PVA = 2:8, c: CS:PVA = 1:9). As illustrated in Fig. 4A, two sharp diffraction peaks appeared at 2θ = 16° and 22.5°, respectively. With the increasing of GO content, the crystallization peak became broad which indicated that the addition of GO had decreased the crystallinity of CS/PVA composites. In Fig. 4B, pure CS showed the characteristic diffraction peak at 2θ = 20.2° [36] which disappeared in CS/PVA composites, showing the good compatibility between CS and PVA. For pure PVA, there was two typical peaks at around 2θ = 16° and 22.5° which became broad in CS/PVA composites. It was concerned with the decrease of the original crystallinity of PVA by addition of CS. The same conclusion could be obtained in Fig. 4C. 3.2.3 DSC The DSC curves of different proportion of CS/PVA/GO nanofibers are showed in Fig. 5 .A showed DSC curves of CS/PVA with different GO, the weight ratio of CS and PVA was constant (1:9), and the weight ratio of CS and GO was different (a: CS:GO = 1:0, b: CS:GO = 1:0.01, c: CS:GO = 1:0.03, d: CS:GO = 1:0.05). Fig. 5B showed DSC curves of CS/PVA without GO (a: pure CS, b: CS:PVA = 3:7, c: CS:PVA = 2:8, d: CS:PVA = 1:9, e: pure PVA). Fig. 5C showed DSC curves of CS/PVA with GO, the weight ratio of CS and GO was constant (1:0.01), and the weight ratio of CS and PVA was different (a: CS:PVA = 3:7, b: CS:PVA = 2:8, c: CS:PVA = 1:9). In Fig. 5A, the peak at 75 °C was concerned with the glass transition temperature (Tg) of PVA, and the second sharp peak appearing nearby 185 °C was concerned with endothermic effect induced by melting of PVA [37]. These two endothermic peak both shifted to lower temperatures with the increasing of GO content due to the interaction between carboxyl, carbonyl groups on the edges of GO and hydroxyl, amino groups in composite system to decrease the crystallinity and form hydrogen bonds. As a result, the sharp peak became broad. In Fig. 5B, there was a peak at around 90 °C in the curve of pure CS which could be attributed to the evaporation of water absorbed by CS molecule. It was observed that, with the increasing of CS, the peaks at around 75 °C and 185 °C shifted to lower temperatures and became broad. The crystallinity of PVA decreased with the increasing of CS, resulting in the melting absorption peak becoming broad and shifting to low temperature. The broad glass transition peak was concerned with the molecule-grade blending between CS and PVA. Meanwhile, the plasticization of residual water in nanofibers contributed to the process to some degree. In Fig. 5C, with the increasing of CS, the glass transition peak of PVA became broad which was attributed to the molecule-grade blending between CS and PVA and the plasticization of residual water. The broad melting absorption peak was concerned with the decreasing of the crystallinity of PVA via the addition of CS. 3.2.4 TGA The thermal behavior of CS/PVA/GO composite nanofibrous membranes was analyzed through thermal gravimetric analysis, showed in Fig. 6 . Fig. 6A showed TGA curves of CS/PVA with different GO, the weight ratio of CS and PVA was constant (1:9), and the weight ratio of CS and GO was different (a: CS:GO = 1:0, b: CS:GO = 1:0.01, c: CS:GO = 1:0.03, d: CS:GO = 1:0.05). Fig. 6B showed TGA curves of CS/PVA without GO (a: pure CS, b: CS:PVA = 3:7, c: CS:PVA = 2:8, d: CS:PVA = 1:9, e: pure PVA). Fig. 6C showed TGA curves of CS/PVA with GO, the weight ratio of CS and GO was constant (1:0.01), and the weight ratio of CS and PVA was different (a: CS:PVA = 3:7, CS:PVA = 2:8, CS:PVA = 1:9). In Fig. 6A, the mass loss of nanofibers was relatively serious, reaching around 70%, at the range of 215 °C–350 °C. In this process, the degradation rate of PVA and CS molecules reached the maximum. The mass loss raised with the increasing of GO due to the decreasing of composite nanofibrous membranes thermal stability via degradation of oxygen containing functional groups on the structure of GO [38]. Meanwhile, the great thermal conductivity of GO accelerated the degradation of composite nanofibrous membranes [39]. In Fig. 6B, the thermal stability of CS/PVA composites decreased due to decrease of the crystallinity of PVA via the addition of CS. Meanwhile, the existence of water also decreased the thermal stability of composite nanofibrous membranes. With the increasing of CS, the initial decomposition temperature dropped due to serious decreasing of the crystallinity of PVA. In Fig. 6C, the little difference among samples of decomposition temperature was about 20 °C. And the less mass loss of composite nanofibrous membranes was result from the increasing of CS."
10,Contact angle,"3.3 Contact angle The hydrophilicity of CS/PVA/GO composite nanofibrous membranes surface was estimated by water contact angle measurement, showed in Fig. 7 . CS, PVA and GO are all hydrophilic materials which could be soluble in aqueous environment. In Fig. 7A–C, with the increasing of CS content, the contact angle of composite nanofibrous membranes decreased gradually. The good hydrophilicity of chitosan was due to the existence of hydrophilic amino and hydroxyl groups in the chain of CS, and the enhanced hydrophilicity was related to the increasing of CS. Comparing with 7A and 7D, the less content of GO (1% of the content of CS) showed inhomogeneous distribution (observed via SEM images) on the surface and interior of the fibrous membranes which affected the contact between the surface of membrane and water drop, coursing the increasing of contact angle. The same conclusion could be obtained via comparing 7B vs 7E and 7C vs 7F. In Fig. 7G and H, increasing the content of GO (reached 3% even 5% of CS), water penetrated into composite nanofibrous membranes and the contact angle significantly decreased. It could be attributed to the more content of GO would well distribute on the surface and interior of the fibrous membranes. And the addition of GO would increase the distance between fibers, conducive to water penetration into the membranes. The existence of abundant oxygen containing groups (carboxyl, hydroxyl and epoxy groups) on the GO nanosheets enhanced the hydrophilicity of nanofibrous membranes. When the content of GO was up to 3%, water drop showed wetting state on the surface of nanofibrous membranes. Here, it didn’t have a significant effect on the hydrophilicity of the nanofibrous membrane by increasing constantly the content of GO."
11,Antibacterial activity assay,"3.4 Antibacterial activity assay The antibacterial activities of the prepared blend CS/PVA/GO composite nanofibrous membranes were investigated against Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus by zone of inhibition tests. The results are showed in Fig. 8 . In Fig. 8A, it could be observed the inhibition zone which showed the good antibacterial activity of composite nanofibrous membranes against E. coli. In Fig. 8B, composite nanofibrous membranes showed the antibacterial activity against S. aureus. It could be obtained that the stronger relatively antibacterial activity against E. coli. originated from sample a and sample g, whose radius of inhibition zone attained 1.10 mm and 1.25 mm, respectively. Sample b, the radius of inhibition zone was 0.17 mm, showed the weak antibacterial activity against E. coli. The better antibacterial activity against S. aureus originated from sample c, which radius of inhibition zone reached 1.40 mm. The weak antibacterial activity belonged to sample b, the radius of which was 0.32 mm. The results showed the enhanced antibacterial activity of CS/PVA/GO composite nanofibrous membranes against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus."
12,Conclusion,"The antibacterial CS/PVA/GO composite nanofibrous membranes were fabricated successfully via electrospinning, where GO sheets, shaping spindle and spherical, were partially embedded into nanofibers. Uniform and smooth morphology of the nanofibers were obtained with a narrow diameter distribution of approximately 83 ± 10 nm. FTIR, XRD, DSC suggested that the good compatibility between CS and PVA induced the formation of hydrogen bonds between CS and PVA. The initial decomposition temperature of composites dropped due to the crystallinity of PVA decreased seriously, with the increasing of CS. Meanwhile, with the increasing of GO, the thermal stability of composite nanofibrous membranes decreased, mass loss of composite nanofibrous membranes reached 70%. Contact angle tests suggested that the good hydrophilicity was concerned with the increasing of CS. While increasing the content of GO, the distance between fibers increased. As a result, water showed wetting state on the surface of composite nanofibrous membranes and contact angle decreased significantly. In antibacterial activity tests, composite nanofibrous membranes showed good antibacterial activity against Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. Therefore, CS/PVA/GO composite nanofibrous membranes proved to be a promising approach to be used widely in wound dressing."
