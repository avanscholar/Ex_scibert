0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a potential energy carrier which, coupled with the use of electric engines and fuel cells (FC), could allow an efficient and environmentally friendly management of the energy resources [1]. However, the production of hydrogen from fossil fuels [2] causes the co-production of CO 2 , which is assumed to be the main responsible for the so-called “greenhouse effect”. The alternative way to obtain hydrogen from water is unproposable for large-scale production up to now, due to the intrinsic lack of energy production in the cycle. This will be so until “green” ways to split water are not developed. The production of hydrogen from renewables and biomasses [3–5], instead, could in principle allow the environmentally friendly use of energy without any increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. “Bioethanol”, i.e. ethanol produced from glucose-rich biomasses, is the typical renewable which allows the production of hydrogen [6,7], or even directly the “green” production of energy. Methanol, higher alcohols and other oxygenate compounds like formic acid can also be produced from biomasses with biotechnological processes and could also be applied as energy sources without any greenhouse effect. The typical utilization of FCs implies first the production of hydrogen through steam reforming (an endothermic reaction) or partial oxidation processes (an exothermic reaction) or using their combination like oxidative steam reforming [8] which allows to obtain an auto-thermal regime. After hydrogen purification, energy is produced with hydrogen-fuelled FCs. An alternative and in principle more direct approach is to feed directly the fuel to the FC anode. This is the case of the so-called “direct methanol fuel cells” (DMFC) [9], but it can be also applied to other fuels like, for oxygenates, ethanol and other alcohols and formic acid. The anode is constituted by a metal which is both active as the catalyst for fuel reforming and as an electrochemical anodic material. The simultaneous performing of the anodic oxidation of hydrogen shifts the steam reforming equilibria so that the reaction is accelerated and may be performed at lower temperatures. Palladium and its alloys are amply used in FC technologies because of their high stability in hydrogen, their ability to permeate hydrogen and also to their activity as catalyst for steam reforming of oxygenates like ethanol [10] and formic acid [11]. Cu-based catalysts are also useful for alcohol steam reforming [8]. Pd–Cu alloy has been considered as constituents of H 2 -permeable membranes [12,13]. Upon this work we investigated the production of hydrogen from propane, propene, isopropanol and acetone, i.e. four C3 organics, over a alumina supported Pd–Cu-based catalyst. The highly loaded noble metal catalyst we studied may be considered as a model for catalytic anodes for direct organic fuel cell, as well as catalysts for hydrogen production. The effect of the hydrogen production conditions (partial oxidation, steam reforming or oxidative steam reforming) and of the presence of oxygenated functional groups on the hydrocarbon skeleton will also be evaluated. Being isopropanol and acetone renewable substances, as metabolites of different microorganisms, and also possible candidates for fuel cells with direct feed [14], this study will also give indication on their possible utilization in green energy production."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The catalyst has been prepared by co-precipitation of the two metal hydroxides over γ -Al 2 O 3 and subsequently dried at 80°C for 48h. The catalyst composition Pd–Cu (1:5 atomic ratio, 30% metal w/w) supported on γ -Al 2 O 3 has been confirmed by microanalysis (EPMA). XRD shows the typical broad pattern of γ -Al 2 O 3 together with peaks of Pd and Cu oxides."
3,Catalytic tests,"2.2 Catalytic tests The catalytic experiments were carried out in a fixed-bed tubular quartz reactor containing 150mg of fresh catalyst mixed with 350mg of quartz particles; the whole catalytic run lasts ca. 9h, the time for each temperature is 45min. Product analysis was performed with two on-line gas-chromatographs (GC) in order to detect both carbon species and H 2 . A Agilent 5890 GC equipped with a PORAPLOT Q (HP) capillary column was connected to a TCD detector in series with a FID detector, and a GC HP 5890 equipped with molecular sieve column (100/120 Carbosieve SII) was connected to a TCD detector. Between them a Nickel Catalyst Tube has been employed to reduce CO and CO2 to CH 4 . In both cases a six-port valve with a 0.5cm 3 loop was used for the gas sampling of the outlet gases. The catalytic tests were performed in two different feeding conditions, as summarized in Table 1 . “Endothermic” steam reforming, was carried out by feeding stoichiometric water-to-organic ratios sufficient to obtain the “complete” steam-reforming reactions as reported in Table 2 . “Auto-thermal” steam reforming, was carried out by feeding organic–water–oxygen mixture allowing to obtain an auto-thermal regime in case of full conversion of the reactants (Table 1). Results are reported based on reactant conversion and product selectivities. In the case of water, negative conversion means that water is produced. Selectivity to H 2 has been defined as the fraction of hydrogen produced with respect to the theoretical full conversion of the organic reactant to hydrogen obtainable from its complete conversion by reacting with fed water and fed oxygen. Selectivity to carbon compounds has been defined as: moles of C-compound produced/moles of C-reactant reacted/stoichiometric coefficient."
4,Results,"The UV-Vis spectrum of the fresh catalyst shows an adsorption peak at 350nm with shoulders at ca. 500nm and at ca. 750nm whereas above 1000nm no adsorption has been detected. Thus UV-Vis analysis confirms that in the fresh catalyst Pd and Cu are in oxidized form, as found by XRD. FT-IR spectra of the adsorption of CO on the catalyst both in oxidized and reduced form are shown in Fig. 1 . Accordingly, CO adsorption over the evacuated fresh catalyst (Fig. 1, II) shows a strong peak at 2120cm - 1 which can be attributed to Cu + carbonyls. Weak components at 2100, 2065 and 1982cm - 1 suggest that reduced Pd particles may be present although may be formed by the reduction of Pd by CO. By pre-reducing the catalyst in H 2 at 723K the sample becomes black and the transmittance of IR radiation decreases very much (Fig. 1, I(a)). This shows that in these conditions Pd and/or Cu metals are formed. In agreement with this, the main CO adsorption band, very weak, is at 2100cm - 1 which can be ascribed to terminal CO over Pd 0 and/or Cu 0 . Our data show that, in agreement with the literature [15], Pd–Cu in reduced atmosphere above 620–670K are mostly reduced, but that in presence of O 2 and H 2 O, dynamic redox cycle can occur. For this reason we did not perform any pre-treatment of the fresh catalyst before the catalytic experiment, allowing the self-conditioning of the catalyst in the different reaction feed. Preliminary blank data showed that reaction of propane in the presence of O 2 started well above 800K whereas the reaction in presence of water and without O 2 starts above 900K. Fig. 2 shows the activity of the catalyst in propane steam-reforming reaction. Propane conversion starts above 800K. Propylene (70% selectivity) and CO 2 (30%) are the only products detectable at low temperature and very low conversion, whose selectivity decreases by increasing temperature. CO keeps a constant selectivity of 22% in the range 900–1100K. In the same range of temperature CH 4 and C 2 H 4 are also observed, their selectivity rising as well. Hydrogen selectivity shows a maximum of 45% at low propane conversion (around 5%) and decreases by increasing temperature down to a minimum of 22% at 1100K. At the same time H 2 O conversion slightly increases to 12% at 1100K. These data indicate that under SR conditions, propane dehydrogenation actually occurs already near 800K. C 3 H 8 = C 3 H 6 + H 2 . The outlet amounts of CO 2 , CO and hydrogen indicate, according to our thermodynamic calculations, that steam reforming of propane C 3 H 8 + 3 H 2 O = 3 CO + 7 H 2 is likely followed by water gas shift reaction CO + H 2 O = CO 2 + H 2 whose equilibrium is actually not reached even at 1100K, although the equilibrium tends to shift towards left by increasing temperature. The conversion of propane is strongly enhanced at higher temperatures, when methane and ethylene are observed. The far higher selectivity to ethylene with respect to methane suggests that, besides the likely occurrence of the cracking reaction C 3 H 8 = C 2 H 4 + CH 4 another reaction producing ethylene occurs, possibly the following one: C 3 H 8 + H 2 O = C 2 H 4 + CO + 3 H 2 . According to this picture, the conversion of water is much lower than the conversion of propane, which are fed with the correct stoichiometry for the SR reaction. The hydrogen yield actually increases by increasing temperature and reaches 16% at 1100K. The conversion/selectivity versus temperature curves of the propane “auto-thermal” steam-reforming reaction are shown in Fig. 3 . Propane conversion starts above 600K and reaches 20% at 775K when oxygen is completely converted and CO 2 with small amounts of CO and propylene are the C-containing products. After this first step, this trend of the reaction is constant in the range 775–925K, afterward propane conversion increases again by increasing temperature; at 1175K propane is also completely converted. In the range 925–1175K CO 2 selectivity decreases to 25% whereas CO and H 2 selectivity as well as H 2 O conversion grow significantly; propylene does not go over 10% whereas ethylene reaches a maximum of 20% at 1100K without substantial methane production. These data suggest that, at low temperatures, total combustion of propane C 3 H 8 + 5 O 2 = 3 CO 2 + 4 H 2 O is predominant while propene is likely produced by oxidative dehydrogenation: C 3 H 8 + 1 2 O 2 = C 3 H 6 + H 2 O . The amount of CO, CO 2 , H 2 and H 2 O observed in the outlet flow in the range 750–930K is in agreement with the thermodynamic equilibrium, showing that the retro-water gas shift is fast under these conditions, when CO 2 is first produced by oxidation. Above 930K the steam reforming reaction starts, and now the CO content is above that relative to the WGS equilibrium. This suggests that, while the retro-WGS reaction is fast, the direct WGS is quite slow, when CO is produced by steam reforming, as already shown above for the SR experiment. In the range 1000–1200K a reaction producing ethylene but not methane is observed again, although ethylene also is converted at even higher temperatures. The hydrogen yield grows steadily with increasing temperature and is 35% at 1100K and 65% at 1170K. The steam reforming of isopropanol has been investigated at higher flow rates due to the higher reactivity of this compound towards unwanted reactions. The conversion of isopropyl alcohol under steam-reforming conditions starts below 600K, as observed in Fig. 4 , being conversion complete at 850K. At the very beginning of the reaction (i.e. less than 10% of conversion) the only product observed is acetone which decreases by increasing temperature in favor of propylene formation which selectivity reaches a maximum of 85% at 850K, whereas acetone decreases up to 15% at the same temperature. CO starts to be detectable from 855K but its selectivity does not exceed 5% at 950K. Hydrogen selectivity is 10% at 950K. In the range 850–950K propylene selectivity decreases from 85% to 60% whereas acetone grows from 15% to 32%, the trend of H 2 O conversion is positive, anyway in this range of temperature isopropanol conversion is 100%. These data indicate that acetone is likely produced by dehydrogenation at low conversion, while propene is produced by dehydration: C 3 H 7 OH = C 3 H 6 O + H 2 . C 3 H 7 OH = C 3 H 6 + H 2 O . True steam reforming only occurs above 850K. However, in these conditions isopropanol is totally converted while propene is the main product. In auto-thermal conditions, as described in Fig. 5 , conversion of isopropyl alcohol gives rise mostly to the production of acetone which has been detected as the only product till complete conversion of both isopropanol and O 2 , reached at 500K. However, after total oxygen conversion, CO 2 is also produced with selectivity near 10%. Acetone selectivity decreases slowly by increasing temperature down to 22% at 1050K. Meanwhile, in the range 600–1050K C 3 H 6 and CO x were detected. C 3 H 6 selectivity is almost constant around 20% in the range 750–1000K, CO 2 reaches a maximum of 18% at 1050K whereas CO selectivity is 50% at the same temperature. In the range 750–1050K the trend of H 2 O conversion is positive. Hydrogen was detected above 850K and reaches 40% of selectivity at 1050K. This confirms that steam reforming only occurs above 850–900K with C–C bond breaking, total and partial oxidation of isopropanol (to CO 2 and acetone, respectively) the main reactions at lower temperature being given by C 3 H 7 OH + 1 2 O 2 = C 3 H 6 O + H 2 O , C 3 H 7 OH + 9 2 O 2 = 3 CO 2 + 4 H 2 O . The acetone conversion in SR conditions in the range 520–920K does not exceed 3%, as shown in Fig. 6 , with selectivities in CH 3 CHO and CO 2 selectivity decreasing by increasing temperature whereas CO selectivity grows reaching a maximum of 62% at 920K. In the temperature range above 850K conversion of acetone and water strongly increase, with the production of methane up to near 40% selectivity. In this range CO is still the main product (55% selectivity) and hydrogen selectivity is near 30%. In the presence of oxygen, the curve corresponding to acetone conversion (shown in Fig. 7 ) shows a plateau at 20% after total oxygen conversion at 550K. The main product is CO 2 , near 70%, with CO stable at 30% selectivity. Only above 850K the conversion of acetone increases steadily, reaching 40% at 1000K. In the same range CO 2 selectivity decreases to 40% whereas CO slightly increases to 40% and CH 4 was detected as well, 20% of selectivity at 1000K. At low temperature in SR conditions acetaldehyde should arise from acetone steam reforming: C 3 H 6 O + 2 H 2 O = C 2 H 4 O + CO 2 + 3 H 2 . At high temperature, acetaldehyde may later decompose: C 2 H 4 O = CO + CH 4 . Propene being the predominant product of isopropanol conversion at intermediate temperatures, the steam reforming of propene has also been investigated. The curves relative to steam reforming of propene performed in the same conditions as isopropanol are shown in Fig. 8 . Conversion of both propene and water grows steadily above 550K giving rise to CO and CO 2 and hydrogen as the largely predominant products. Only above 850K methane is also formed in small amounts. Hydrogen selectivity is always very high approaching 100% but decreases at the highest temperature in concomitance with the production of methane."
5,Discussion,"The four reactions studied here are shown in the Table 2 with the corresponding Δ H ∘ and η (thermal efficiency) values. The thermal efficiency can be defined as η = n H 2 LHV H 2 / n C - reactant LHV C - reactant , where η is the thermal efficiency, n H 2 the outlet hydrogen molar flow, nC-reactant the inlet molar flow of C-reactant, and LHV H 2 and LHV C-reactant the low heating values of hydrogen and ethanol, respectively. Table 2 shows the theoretical (i.e. calculated on stoichiometric basis) η for the reactions proposed. Thermal efficiency [16] relates to the increase in the heating value of the hydrogen produced with respect to the organic reactant and consequently measures the usefulness of the conversion to produce energy. According to the η values shown in the table in all cases the conversion increases the energy obtainable from the corresponding organic compound. Obviously this energy difference must be delivered in the hydrogen production step either by burning part of the reactant or by heating the furnace. Otherwise, isopropanol is the reactant which corresponds the highest thermal efficiency for steam reforming. This means that the conversion of isopropanol into hydrogen allows to increase more the heating value, with respect to isopropanol itself, with respect to the other reactants. The data summarized above show that our Pd–Cu/Al 2 O 3 catalyst is active for different reactions such as dehydrogenations, oxidative dehydrogenations, total oxidations. These reactions may occur in the conditions of endothermic and/or “auto-thermal” steam reforming of C3 organics. However, high conversions of water and organics together, to give carbon oxides and hydrogen (i.e. steam reforming), only is obtained at quite high temperature when propane, isopropanol and acetone are fed. The onset temperature for this reactivity is near 850K, and is likely the temperature needed to break the C–C double bond in reducing conditions, i.e. when oxygen is not present (SR) or is totally consumed (“auto-thermal” SR). At this so high temperature steam reforming occurs but the production of methane and ethene lowers the selectivities to CO x and hydrogen, the desired products. These hydrocarbons may form by cracking or incomplete reforming of the C3 organics, while methane may also be formed “de novo” by methanation of CO x . Interestingly, propene steam reforming is observed to be by far the fastest SR reaction over our catalyst. Highly selective propene SR is found to occur already in the range 600–800K. The faster conversion of propene with respect to propane does not seem to be surprising. In fact it is well known that palladium is able to activate olefinic C C double bonds towards, e.g. hydrogenation. The presence of this functional group may also explain the faster reaction of propene with respect to acetone, whose negatively charged oxygen is likely responsible for adsorption on the catalyst metal centers. Less easy may be to explain why isopropanol SR only occurs above 850K too, like acetone and propane. This in spite of the high selectivity to propene found upon IPA conversion in SR conditions. It is possible that either acetone, which is co-produced with propene from IPA, or IPA itself may poison the active sites for propene adsorption or steam reforming. The heterogeneously catalyzed gas-phase reforming of alcohols and ketones, in spite of their possible formation by biotechnological processes which makes them “renewable” raw materials for hydrogen and energy production, may not be a very promising approach. In fact, over our catalyst incomplete conversion to hydrogen of these oxygenates is observed and high temperature are needed for it. This means that the presence of oxygenated functional groups may not be useful for steam reforming, at least over Pd–Cu catalyst. On the contrary, the lower temperature and higher selectivity found for propene steam reforming over this catalyst seem to be interesting also in relation to the quite low prices of olefinic compounds, the availability of low-value mixed olefin-containing streams, and the possibility to convert bioalcohols into “renewable” olefins."
