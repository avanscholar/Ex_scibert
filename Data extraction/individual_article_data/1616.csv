0,Introduction,"Over the past decade, the scientific community has witnessed a tremendous increase in the number of research and papers published on the development of metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) and their compounds such as composites, hybrids, alloys, etc., and investigation of their effects on human society [1,2]. Metal oxide NPs are considered as a frontier between homogenous and heterogeneous catalysis due to their substantial features such as quantum scale, morphology, dielectric environment, inert-gap between the particles, and the catalytic performance [3–7]. Hence, using metal oxide nanocatalysts are considered as a great innovation for carrying out various types of chemical reactions like inorganic and organic reactions. Consequently, scientists believe that both green chemistry and nanoscience research focus on the fabrication of nanoscale composite using natural resources such as plants and soil. Employing the green and eco-friendly techniques such as solvent-free method [8], metal nanoparticle-catalyzed organic synthesis enhancement (NOSE) [6], magnetic nanomaterials-catalyzed integrating synthesis enhancement (MNISE) [7], and diverse NOSE approaches, which were carried out by green materials such as rutile-TiO2 [4] and bio-silica supported Fe2O3 nanoparticles [5], etc. could be so helpful options to facilitate carrying out the chemical reactions. Among various species of the metallic NC, vanadium containing structures have attracted so much attentions and have been widely used for large-scale purposes such as fuel cell [9] and environmental applications [10], due to its high activity, convenient synthetic process, noticeable thermal resistance, accessibility and high stability in the catalytic processes. Recently, various derivatives of vanadium compounds have been used in catalytic oxidation reactions. For instance, vanadium-functionalized clays for oxidation of the diesel desulfurization has been reported [11]. Perlite as one of the most instrumental natural resources has several advantages such as high density of rhyolite, heat treated and light weight, herbal structure, low conductivity, extreme surface area, nontoxic material and high potency for ion exchange. It also have so many exchangeable functional groups (silanol and alumina) onto the surface that are suitable active sites for chemical functionalization. That is why the attentions have been focused on employing these green materials for water treatment or catalysis purposes. There are numerous supporting approaches described in the literature for synthesis of nanocomposite with natural bases. These approaches usually suffer from the shortcomings such as low yields, harsh conditions, toxicity of solvent, low recovery, production of the undesirable byproducts, and expensive raw materials [12–28]. At this juncture, a NGSS (Nanocomposite-catalyzed Green Synthesis Supporting) is explored as a modern protocol to fabricate nanocomposites based on different natural substrates with more favorable catalytic properties such as enhanced the surface area, pore volume, formation of direct bonding between metal cations with the surface of clay materials, etc. Here, the presence of perlite as an appropriate basis can enhance the catalyst surface area that often makes more effectively and stability catalyst in the catalysis processes. The rectangle shape of vanadium pentaoxide particles was arranged on the perlite surface to give a spherical structure, because of mutual interactions between vanadium ions and the perlite surface. In continuation to this, we wish to report a simple oxidation method involving perlite supported V2O5 catalyzed oxidation of benzylic alcohols into the corresponding aldehyde with high yield at RT using environmentally benign H2O2 as a co-sole oxidant in acetonitrile under aerobic conditions (Fig. 1 )."
1,Experimental,
2,General,"2.1 General Without any further purification analytical grade chemicals were used upon purchased. All the chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Expanded Perlite was prepared from Kaneh Azar Co. (Tabriz, Iran). Crystalline structure and crystallite size of prepared samples determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) on JEOL with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 nm at 20 Kv, scanning rate 0.02 θ/sec) with wide angle ranging from 10°-80°. Surface morphology of all samples was investigated using scanning electron microscope (SEM, AIS 2100, Seron Technology). The surface area and the pore size distribution were estimated by multi point Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method and (Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda(BJH method, respectively. The elemental analysis of the fabricated nanocomposite was determined by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis (EDS), and scanning electron microscopy for elemental mapping (SEM-EDS) images were performed using JOEL-JEM 2100F microscope. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) transmission spectra were taken on Shimaduz FT-IR-8400 spectrophotometer using KBr pellet for sample preparation. After the recycling test, inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis of V, Al and Si was performed at the Service Central d’Analyse of CNRS at the French facility (Vernaison). The remided powders were prepared by acid digestion using concentrated ultra-high grade HNO3 solution (69%)."
3,Practical methods,"2.2 Practical methods 2.2.1 Preparation of perlite/V2O5 NC via green NGSS approach Solid powder of perlite/V2O5 NC was synthesized using green synthesis supporting (NGSS) method under solovothermal condition process. In brief, perlite (0.52 g) and ethylene glycol (EG, 30.0 mL) were well-mixed and were sonicated (20 KHz, 400 W) for 1 h to dissociate the flocculated perlite powder and obtain more uniform mixture. Afterward, ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3, 0.52 g) was affixed to the mixture (perlite and EG), was stirred and was kept for 4 h at 70 °C. At this stage, the mutation color of the solution was seen from the pale yellow to the darkest yellow until it was finally fixed on the golden yellow. Then, the yield was transformed to a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and sustained at 180 °C for 48 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the product was gathered by centrifugation and washed with ethanol and deionized water to remove and elimination any organic materials adsorbed on the surface. After that, NC was dried at 70 °C, and was pinpointed in crucible and calcined at 300 °C for 3 h. All experimental stages of NGSS process and alteration colors of perlite/V2O5 nanocomposite are shown in Scheme 1 . 2.2.2 Oxidation of benzyl alcohol derivatives by perlite/V2O5 NC In a general procedure for the oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds, the alcohol (1 mmol) was added to a mixture of H2O2 (1.0 mmol) and V2O5/perlite (20.0 mg) in CH3CN (2.0 mL), and then the mixture was refluxed at 82 °C for the specified time. The reaction progress was monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). After completion of the reaction, the catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture through filtration and the mixture was washed with ethyl acetate for two times (EtOAc, 5.0 mL) and then was decanted. The resulting solution was extracted with ethyl acetate (2.0 × 5.0 mL), and then dried with Na2SO4. The evaporation of EtOAc under reduced pressure gave the pure products in 90% yields. It should be noted that all oxidation reactions of the primary alcohols and its derivatives were performed in the existence of oxygen."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Characterization of perlite/V2O5 NC,"3.1 Characterization of perlite/V2O5 NC The physical properties of the composites (surface, porosity and crystallization) were investigated by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Elemental analysis, XRD, BET and FTIR, and XRF. Also, the catalytic activity, stability, and its recovery of this NC was examined by alcohol oxidation. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of perlite/V2O5 NC (pre-calcination, post-calcination, after oxidation) were precisely compared with individual perlite and V2O5, as shown in Fig. 2 A and B. As can be seen, the XRD pattern of raw perlite (pattern 1A) is similar to the patterns of the amorphous materials. In fact, the presence of the various metal oxides in different ratios, causes to obtain chaotic crystalline. Before the calcination process of perlite/V2O5 NC, the phase was indexed as vanadyl glycolate (VO(CH2O)2) (pattern 2A). With heating up to ~200 °C, the intensity of the peak appeared at 2θ = 11.04° was significantly increased. Two peaks at 2θ = 11.04° and 22.16° distinguished with miler indices (1 0 0) and (1 1 0), respectively, are related to the monoclinic phase of VO(CH2O)2. It should be noted that the presence of the perlite is effective on both intensity and width of the peak appeared at 2 θ = 20.16°. After the calcination process of perlite/V2O5 NC, the reflections were matched with orthorhombic V2O5 (JCPDS-00-041-1421) with cell dimensions of 11.5160 × 3.5656 × 4.3727 and space group Pmmn. In pattern (3A) belonging to perlite/V2O5 (post-calcination), the arc-shaped base line shows that some of the materials are in the amorphous form, as well. Moreover, some additional important data could be obtained from the XRD patterns of the fictionalized perlite, as shown in Fig. 2B. First, the peak intensities related to V2O5 phase are low because of the modification process. Second, no significant shift was observed in the position of the peaks in the diffraction pattern of V2O5. Third, no noticeable impurities can be observed in the graphs. Additionally, the crystallite sizes that were calculated trough Scherrer's equation, and also 2θ values related to the intense reflection, are arranged for both samples, as reported in Table 1S (see supporting file). The size, morphology, and uniformity of the prepared perlite/V2O5 NC were investigated through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) graphs with different magnifications, as illustrated in Fig. 3 . As can be seen in the images, before the NGSS process, the morphology of V2O5 (prepared at 300 °C) was agglomerated polygon shapes with the average size of 120.87 nm and the raw perlite was laminate-liked with wide diameter of approximately 1–2 μm, as shown Fig. 3(A and B). During applying of the NGSS route at 180 °C, it is noted that some of particles were gathered around themselves without any specific shape and stuck to the micro laminate-shape of the perlite. By studying several related references [29,30], we believe that the these particles is due to interaction between activated functional groups of perlite (silanol, alumina, and hydroxyl groups) and vanadyl glycolat, to prepare a complex structure (perlite/VO(CH2O)2) (Fig. 3C). In the sequentially stage (calcination stage at 300 °C for 3 h), it is appeared that V2O5 particles are spherically arranged around each other and placed on the edges of the perlite platelets, which are separately remained, as shown in Fig. 3D. It is worth mention to an important point, another factor that can be affect on the growth of V2O5 with spherical-like morphology is that when ammonium vanadate was interacted with ethylene glycol at high temperature and pressure, nitrogen gas is released. This gas helps to form a spherical structure [29,30]. From the SEM observations and XRD patterns, it can be emphasized that the composite of each them is formed. On the other hand, the oxidation reactions are not negatively affected on the perlite/V2O5 NC sphere-shaped particles, as shown in Fig. 3E, F. The sphere-shaped morphology of Perlite/V2O5 NC (after calcination) provide an extreme active surface area that was investigated and confirmed by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) technique. Specific surface area and total pore volume, which were obtained through the N2-BET measurement for desired final product are 134.33 m2 g−1 and 0.982 cm2 g−1, respectively (Fig. 4 ). The pore-size distribution was determined by using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method from the desorption branch of the isotherm. Also, the average pore diameter of the sample is 7.98 nm, which is attributed to the assembled nanoparticles of V2O5 and some macro-pores that were constructed by the perlite micro sheets. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of V2O5, perlite, and perlite/V2O5 NC (pre- and post-calcination and after oxidation reaction) were shown in Fig. 5 . Table 1 concisely reported all the FT-IR absorbance peaks that were appeared in the spectra, and also their assignments. The formation of vanadyl glycolate at 180 °C (before calcination) was confirmed by four main peaks that were observed in 1679 cm−1, 1000 cm−1 and 792, 671 cm−1, and coming from the [CH2O] group in vanadyl glycolate, V=O stretching bond and V–O bond, respectively (spectra B) [29–33]. With a glance at the spectra B (pre- and post-calcination), it is figured out that some of the absorbance peaks related to the vanadyl glycolate complex, were disappeared through the calcination process. According to Table 2 , by comparing the spectra related to pre-calcination and post-calcination (Fig. 5A), this is found that the peak belong to the V=O in vanadyl glycolate shifts to the higher wavenumber (1000 cm−1). Whereas, this value is ~1018 cm−1 for V=O bond in V2O5. Most likely, this shift in wavenumber is occurred because of the conversion of vanadium(IV) to vanadium(V) through increasing the temperature up to ~300 °C. Actually, in vanadyl glycolate structure, the increase in the number of the oxygen atoms (that is as electron-withdrawing groups) around the V=O groups causes the observed shift. The elemental analysis EDS (energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) was used to elucidate that the synthesized catalyst was made of V, O, Al and Si elements. From the EDS spectra, it is also proven that no remarkable impurities were observed in the structure of the perlite/V2O5 NC (Fig. 6 ). The EDS measurement of the perlite/V2O5 NC product was revealed that it is composed of V, Si, Al and O elements, which were detected in the atomic ratios 17.66%, 10.99%, 22.48% and 68.96%, respectively. In fact, the EDS analysis confirms that the prepared NC consists entirely stoichiometric ratio of 1:1 of perlite and V2O5 components. The SEM-EDS mapping images of the individual structure of perlite/V2O5 NC show that the Si, Al, O and V elements were well distributed in the whole structures of the sphere-shaped NC with high uniformity (Fig. 7 A). In addition, the SiO2, Al2O3, K2O, Na2O, CaO and MgO contents of the perlite which were determined by XRF is given in Table 2S (see supporting file). After catalytic oxidation, the nanocatalyst was simply isolated from the reaction mixture medium and dried at 70 °C. Afterward, electron scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and elemental analysis (EDS) were again taken and precisely investigated. The results showed that the structure of our produced catalyst is stable under oxidation reaction conditions. From the XRD pattern (see Fig. 1B), it was observed that all the main peaks of nanocatalyst was remained and no changes were occurred after the catalytic process. Also, to prove the stability of the catalyst after carrying out the catalytic reaction, SEM images of sample were prepared. According to Fig. 3E, F, the sphere-shaped structure of catalyst was well preserved. According to Fig. 5A, the main peaks of NC were observed in both post-calcination state and after oxidation of the benzylic alcohols. From this results in Fig. 5A, it can be concluding that no possible shift was detected in the wavenumber or in the intensity of absorption peaks. To obtain more confirmations about sphere-shaped morphology of our NC (after oxidation) conservation the EDS spectra were also taken, as presented by Fig. 6B. According to the obtained results, the weight ratios are remained constant without any change. SEM-mapping images were also confirming the uniformity of dispersed particles on the surface of NC after the oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol derivatives (Fig. 7B)."
6,Interpretation of the obtained results from the oxidation of alcohols on perlite/V2O5 NC,"3.2 Interpretation of the obtained results from the oxidation of alcohols on perlite/V2O5 NC For screening the performance of the produced nanocatalyst, oxidation of the primary aromatic alcohols was considered under mild conditions (acetonitrile as a convenient solvent, 1 mmol of H2O2, 0.02 g of nanocatalyst) for short times (~5 min). 3.2.1 Catalytic performance test Initially, to dissect the oxidation ability of the fabricated (perlite/V2O5 NC) catalyst, the oxidation of primary benzyl alcohol was compared under various factors. The influence of peroxide hydrogen or oxygen on the catalytic performance of primary benzyl alcohol in the existence of perlite and/or V2O5 is tabled in below table (Table 2). With an optimized reaction condition in hand, it is found that the highest oxidation level of phenylmethanol reaches 90% in acetonitrile among the utilized solvents in the presence of our nanocomposite (Table 2, entry 8). According the results shown above, perlite/V2O5 NC is the best option relative to each of its components. 3.2.2 Solvent effect To investigate the effects of medium, oxidation reactions of alcohols were carefully monitored in the presence of different solvents (ethanol, acetonitrile, ethylacetate, DMSO, dichloromethane, DMF, toluene, deionized water, and methanol) under O2, at room temperature. Table 3S reports the obtained results from the optimization reactions. As can be seen in the table, the highest reaction yield (90%) was obtained in CH3CN solution that is much more than that obtained in DMSO and DMF. Considering entries 1 and 2 of Table 4S (see supporting file), toluene and water are not suitable mediums for conversion of alcohols to carbonyl compounds. According to the comparison with other reports, for oxidation of the alcohol derivatives different green solvents such as water and ethanol have been used. For example, Zhang and his colleagues has reported oxidation of benzyl alcohols in water during 24 h [34]. Chen et al. has pointed out that the best oxidation of benzyl alcohols to their corresponding compounds (aldehyde and ketones) with high selectivity is occurred in water at 80 °C in 6 h [35]. The aldehydronative of alcoholic compounds in an aqueous media in the presence of Cp*Ir complex has been studied by the Kawahra research group [36]. In this work, the main factors of oxidation reactions such as reaction time, conditions, and required amounts of auxiliary (NC) are remarkably improved in comparison with other reports. 3.2.3 Effectiveness of hydrogen peroxide ratio As an additional study, the ability of the aqueous hydrogen peroxide as a green solvent was investigated in this report. A summary of the obtained results of screening the optimal amount of hydrogen peroxide and the obtained yields of the aerobic oxidation using different ratios of NC is reported in Table 5S (see supporting file) (from entry 1 to entry 7). By mention to the obtained results, increasing the amount of NC leads to the enhancement of the isolated yield of the oxidation reaction product (entries 1–3). Using higher content of catalyst helps to increase the oxidation revenue that reached 90% (entry 3). However, it is concluded that there is a synergistic catalytic effect between the prepared perlite/V2O5 NC and hydrogen peroxide that provide high effective conditions for oxidation reactions in presence of the least possible amount of H2O2. 3.2.4 Catalytic assessment An the next stage, the catalytic performance of perlite/V2O5 NC was monitored via screening the oxidation of diversified benzyl alcohol derivatives under mild conditions (5 min, 1 mmol of H2O2, 0.02 g of nanocatalyst). The various derivatives of benzyl alcohol including either electron-withdrawing or electron-donating substituents were smoothly converted to their corresponding aldehydes with high yields (Table 3 , entries 1–12). According to Table 3, methoxy-containing benzyl alcohol derivatives entries (6, 7 and 9) yielded the associated compounds in 92%, 70% and 90% isolated yields, respectively. Whereas, halogen-containing derivatives were oxidized in the obtained yields 75% for 4-chlorobenzyl alcohol and 83% for 4-bromobenzyl alcohol. As presented in Table 2, benzyl alcohol derivatives with electron-deficient substrates showed lower reactivity than electron-rich ones. For instance, 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol and 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol (entries 4 and 5) gave 65% and 72% yields, respectively. In the case of ortho-substituted derivatives, no significant difference was observed in comparison with para-isomer. Most likely, this is due to the existence of a steric hindrance in the structure. However, several catalysts with exclusive morphologies and structures have been reported for redox reaction purposes, and their catalytic performances in aerobic oxidation reactions have been evaluated, as reported in (Table 5S, see supporting file). Accordingly, intense conditions or longer reaction times are needed for catalyzing the reactions by reported catalysts in comparison with our presented catalyst."
7,Mechanistic studies,
8,The formation mechanism of perlite/V2O5 NC,"4.1 The formation mechanism of perlite/V2O5 NC Considering unique properties of ethylene glycol (EG) such as high boiling point (~197 °C) and excellent dielectric constant (37 at 25 °C), this is considered as a suitable solvent for mineral salts that are widely used in synthesis reactions of nanostructures [37–46]. For instance, Sun et al. have pointed out that EG was universally used as a strong coordinator agent via cross-linking with ion metal [47]. Jinang and her colleagues shown that the growth EG plays a key role as complexing agent in preparation of metal oxides (TiO2, SnO2, In2O3) nanowires. Additionally, glycolate derivatives could be converted to their common metal oxides when they are calcined under air atmosphere, at 500 °C for 2 h [48]. Uchaker and her co-workers reported that V2O5 hollow microsphere are synthesized by using EG under solovothermal route [29]. They also figured out that the EG plays a significant role as a reducing agent for vanadate ions (VO3 −) and acts as a chelating agent in the formation of vanadyl glycolate. During the reaction, micro-bubbles of nitrogen gas are produced and the accumulation of vanadyl glycolate nanoparticles is occurred around the N2 micro-bubbles, and hollow microspheres with high surface stability are formed (Scheme 2 ) [29]. Ragupathy et al. noted that pure nano-strips orthorhombic V2O5 are obtained using two simple procedures. In this case, the vanadyl ethylene glycolate (VO(CH2O)2) is formed, and then vanadium pentaoxide is prepared by calcination process at 600 °C for 3 h [31]. In general, the synthesis of our NC in presence of EG was carried out in three steps. The first step involves dispersing perlite in EG via ultrasound irradiation. The purpose of this step is to activate the functional groups (silanol, alumina) on the surface of perlite, which their related vanadium compounds with nanoscale were grown on the its surface in the next stages (Scheme 3 ) [49,50]. The second step is continued by adding the ammonium vanadium to a solution of perlite/EG, in which vanadyl glycolate is deposited on the perlite surface. This stage is done by interfacial penetration between the phases of the reactive species. Additionally, the size of the final composite particles is controlled by the Ostwald ripening. In the last stage, vanadyl glycolate was converted to vanadium pentaoxide under calcination conditions and the sphere-shaped structures were resulted [29]. After addition of the precursor (NH4VO3), the oxidation number is changed and it causes the color change in the solutions, as illustrated in Scheme 3. According to previous studies, EG is also used as reductant agent with chelating capability and is reacted with vanadate ion. Initially, the vanadate ion is reduced to dioxo vanadium ion and the color of solution is changed from bright yellow to golden yellow. This change in color is occurred because of the production of vanadyl glycolate with an unstable structure. In this case, Weeks et al. have reported that the glycolate contains square pyramid units of VO5. In this structure, the V=O with bond length 1.58 °A is lower than V─O with bond length 2.131 °A, and the square pyramids share edges in a two up-two down fashion to give chains of formula VO(OCH2CH2O)2 [30]. Therefore, it could be deduced that structure B is more stable than structure A. This glycolate chain with highly hydrolytic resistant is formed under solovothermal conditions. The evolution of the vanadyl glycolate reaction is illustrated schematically in Scheme 3 (reaction 3). Afterward, the violet precipitate was transformed to yellow powder of vanadium pentaoxide at 300 °C, as shown in Scheme 3, reaction 4. Most likely, the sphere-shaped morphology of the aggregated vanadyl glycolate nanoparticles is formed because of effective electrostatic forces between the ingredients. In fact, the aggregation of vanadyl glycolate around the high platelet of perlite minimize their interfacial energy. Perlite can cause effective polarized interactions with oxygen atoms of vanadyl glycolate due to having the substantial properties such as hydrphilicity and cross-linking capability with other similar groups such as silanol and alumina groups. (Scheme 3). These cross-linkages can effect on vanadium oxidation states and also lead to form electrostatics interactions. Researchers have reported a model of the environmental coordination of V(V+) sites in the silicate network [30]. It should be noted that the morphology of the individual nanoparticles was altered to sphere-shape upon transition from vanadyl glycolate to V2O5. This partial change in the morphology can be attributed to the disassembling during the annealing process because of lattice mismatch and accomping strain experienced during the transformation process. Also, the vanadium atoms interact with …V=O…V=O… chain and create a one-dimensional structure. There are several effective factors in the synthetic process such as Ostwald process, sintering temperature, the solvent type and its role, and etc. However, the morphology and size of the accumulated nanoparticles are remained intact. Scheme 3 displays all reactions growth steps of the vanadyl glycolate and V2O5 on perlite. The FT-IR pattern confirms the presence of the CH2O group of V=O and V–O bonds at 1500, 1000 and 570 cm−1. Also, The XRD patterns of NC (before and after the calcination process) help to confirm well-preparation of perlite/vanadyl glycolate and perlite/V2O5, respectively. The detailed mechanism of catalytic oxidation process involves the successive transformation of the alcohols. First, the formation of the reactive oxygen species, second, electron transfer and redox transformations of the vanadium oxidation states. This mechanistic suggestion is in full agreement with the reported results by Jinang et al. [51] and Kaichev et al. [43], who revealed that the main route for electro-oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding carboxylic acids on Pd–Ni–P or TiO2/V2O5 catalysts is an electron transfer process. Both researchers have pointed out that the structure of the functional groups are not changed and the cations are not reduced during the process."
9,Oxidation mechanism,"4.2 Oxidation mechanism The oxidation mechanism can be described in terms of the sequence of the elementary steps shown in Scheme 4 . It should be noted that this mechanism is in a great accordance with the micro kinetic proposed by Li and Iglesia [21] for oxidation of primary alcohols over multicomponent metal oxide catalysts. They have used mathematic modeling for determination of the main reaction steps. The catalytic cycle is started by the catalyst with a change in the oxidation state. According to Scheme 4, the alcohol is adsorbed by V(V+) at the first stage. In fact, the role and effectiveness of the pore sizes on the oxidation process is highlighted at this stage. This is assumed that the main role is being played by the empty cavities with average pore size (7.98 nm), which can provide the necessary oxygen for the formation of vanadium-hydrate (O=V(IV+)H2). In the next stage, high active radical species (O=V(IV+)-O-O●) are generated in the presence of the hydrogen peroxide, as presented in BET analysis section. Since, the formation of vanadium-hydrate species causes a noticeable reduction in the peak intensity of V=O bond (at ~1018 cm−1), and also a sharp peak is appeared at ~3434 cm−1 (due to H-binding) in the FT-IR spectra (Fig. 4), it can be deduced that the chemisorption of benzylic alcohol is a heterolytic process in which a proton from alcohol is transferred to vanadyl oxygen atom and the oxidation state of vanadium is changed from V(V+) to V(IV+) [52]. In the next step, aldehyde is formed via a proton-transferring process from CH2 groups to the catalyst. Thus, it is concluded that the nascent hydroxyl groups may be bonded with the vanadium cations. Ultimately, the –OH group is recombined with another –OH group to form H2O and related aldehyde is produced. However, it should be noted that the exact role of the bridge V─O─M (M: Si or Al) bond in the oxidative dehydrogenation of benzylic alcohol is still considered as a hot-topic for scientific discussions. For example, Kilos et al. have developed a plausible mechanism for the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde over VOx/Al2O3 catalyst in which only the terminal (V=O) bond and the bridge (V─O─V) bond are involved [53]. According to Table 2, benzyl alcohol derivatives were converted to their corresponding aldehyde in more yields. Therefore, it can be deduced that the adsorbed intermediated complexes react with lattice oxygen atoms to form the adsorbed aldehyde species. Also, several different catalytic systems such as Fe2O3/V2O5 and V2O5/TiO2 have been reported for assisting the formation of aldehydes from relative alcohols [18,47–49,54–56]."
10,Recyclability of the nanocatalyst,"4.3 Recyclability of the nanocatalyst The life time of heterogeneous catalyst and its level reusability are significant key factors for the particle applications. To indicate high efficacy, we performed a series of oxidation experiments of alcohols using our catalyst under the same standard reaction conditions (Fig. 8 ). After the completion of the reaction for the first time, the perlite/V2O5 NC is separated from the reaction mixture and is washed with a mixture of DI water/ethanol, then dried in the class 70 °C for 6 h. After these five cycles, it was observed that perlite/V2O5 NC declared much lower catalytic performance (the yield exceeded 80%), because the number of the active sites over the catalyst surface is decreased [57]. At the end of the each recycling stage, the remaining catalyst was collected and was investigated by performing an ICP-OES analysis. By the results of this analysis (Table 6S, see supporting file), it was verified that the amount of vanadium, aluminum, and silicon remained and did not change after five cycles. Therefore, this catalyst can be utilized at least 5 times without any significant change in its activity."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, a novel preparation method (NGSS) for perlite-supported vanadium pentoxide (perlite/V2O5) NC with sphere-shaped morphology and the pores in 7.98 nm mean size under solovothermal conditions is presented. In this regard, we have practically studied the performance of the prepared perlite/V2O5 in oxidation reactions of different benzyl alcohol derivatives to their corresponding aldehydes in 5 min at room temperature. The obtained results have disclosed that the most appropriate suggestion for NGSS method is functionalization of the metal oxide NPs with various natural substances like perlite to enhance their performances for alcohol oxidation reaction. Economic benefits of the presented strategy and also the great capability for recycling via a simple thermal treatment process, make perlite/V2O5 NC distinguished from other catalytic nanoscale systems. In this report, in addition of the introducing a convenient preparation route for a novel sphere-shaped catalytic system, preliminary insight for detailed mechanism for oxidation of primary benzylic alcohols to their aldehydes analogues has been comprehensively discussed. From the mechanistic aspect, this is shown that the main surface intermediates-states complexes (including reactive radicals) are formed during the catalytic process and well converted to the desired products and the selected oxidation reaction passes through a redox pathway. During the reaction, V(V) is reversibly converted to V(IV) in the presence of H2O2, and the structure of other functional groups (-OAl and –Si(OH)3) is remained intact. Overall, in this work, a novel heterogeneous sphere-shaped nanoscale catalytic system (perlite/V2O5 NC) based on a natural resource has been presented and successfully applied in oxidation reactions of alcohols. As the further project, additional applications such as electrochemical supercapacitor behavior and biological activities of the prepared perlite/V2O5 NC would be studied."
