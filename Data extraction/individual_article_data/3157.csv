0,Introduction,"The oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds is a topic of interest in organic chemistry, both at laboratory and industrial level [1,2]. Consequently, a wide range of methods has been developed over the years to address this transformation [2]. Commonly, stoichiometric approaches are used because of their high selectivities and yields [1,2]. These include such recognized methods as Swern or Oppenauer oxidations or reactions with chromium(VI) or hypervalent iodine oxidants [2a, 3]. However, these stoichiometric oxidants are not only relatively expensive but they also produce large quantities of toxic waste. Likewise, the swelling environmental apprehensions have led chemists to develop cleaner and greener reactions for chemical transformations [2]. Several approaches to catalytic alcohol oxidations based on transition metals or organocatalysts [4], as well as biocatalytic methods [5], have been described in recent times. However, despite this abundance of methods to select from, alcohol oxidation is still considered to be a challenging issue at the industrial scale. This occurs, in part, due to the large number of variables that have to be simultaneously optimized to make a feasible process, e.g.: (chemo)-selectivity, cost, safety, toxicity, environmental impact, etc. In particular, the majority of known methods for alcohol oxidation are unsustainable even at the laboratory level. Recently, within our interest on alcohol oxidations we have developed a series of transition-metal containing catalytic systems where various homogeneous and heterogeneous metal frameworks were evaluated in cooperation with different oxidants and additives [6]. It should be mentioned that for some catalytic oxidations of secondary alcohols, the full conversion of substrates to the corresponding ketones under mild conditions was reached [6]. To further develop these studies, we turned our attention to the design of new and simple organic molecules as potential organocatalysts on the oxidation of alcohols, since transition metal-free processes are pre-requisites in many pharmaceutical and other synthetic procedures. As such, we turned our attention to thiazole derivatives in view of our interest and experience in this type of organic scaffolds [7]. Herein we present the catalytic studies of one of such molecules, a tetrazole-amino-saccharin, namely 3-((2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)amino)benzisothiazole 1,1-dioxide (5) (Scheme 1 ), towards the oxidation of benzyl alcohols in a microwave assisted protocol."
1,Experimental section,
2,General methods,"2.1 General methods Unless otherwise noted, solvents and starting materials were obtained from Aldrich. All chemicals used were of reagent grade without further purification before use. Column chromatography was performed using silica gel 60MN and aluminium-backed silica gel Merck 60 F254 plates were used for analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC). Melting points were recorded and are uncorrected. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker Avance II 300 (UltraShield™ Magnet) spectrometer operating at 300MHz (1H) and 75MHz (13C). The chemical shifts are reported in ppm using TMS as internal standard. Carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen elemental analyses were carried out by the Microanalytical Service of the Instituto Superior Técnico – University of Lisbon. FT-IR spectra (4000–400cm−1) were recorded on a VERTEX 70 (Bruker) spectrometer using KBr pellets. Mass spectra were obtained on a VG 7070E mass spectrometer by electron ionization (EI) at 70eV. Chromatographic analyses were performed in a Fisons Instruments GC 8000 series gas chromatograph with a DB-624 (J&W) capillary column (DB-WAX, column length: 30m; internal diameter: 0.32mm), FID detector and the Jasco-Borwin v.1.50 software; GC conditions: Tinjection =240°C, Tinitial =140°C (1min) raised 10°Cmin−1 to 220°C (1min), carrier gas: He."
3,Synthesis of organocatalyst (5) and precursor compounds 2 and 4a,"2.2 Synthesis of organocatalyst (5) and precursor compounds 2 and 4a 3-Chloro-1,2-benzisothiazole-1,1-dioxide (saccharyl chloride, 2), 2-methyl-(2H)-tetrazole-5-amine (4a) and 3-((2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)amino)benzisothiazole 1,1-dioxide (5) were synthesised using protocols reported previously [6a, 8]."
4,Catalytic assays via MW irradiation,"2.3 Catalytic assays via MW irradiation Experiments with 2.5–5.0mmol of substrates and 6.25–12.50mmol of oxidant were conducted using a focused Anton Paar Monowave 300 microwave reactor in 10mL glass vessels with 10mm internal diameter, sealed with rubber membranes in a stirred mode with simultaneous cooling (IR temperature detector). The targeted temperature together with a maximum microwave power (50 or 100W) was set. The targeted temperature was reached within a few minutes. During the course of the reaction, the microwave power (20–30W) as well as the pressure (1–10bar) varied. At the end of the reaction, the reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature and the vessel cap was carefully opened to slowly release the pressure."
5,Gas-chromatography analysis,"2.4 Gas-chromatography analysis Succeeding the MW-assisted reaction, 7mL of acetonitrile together with acetophenone (1.25–2.50mmol; internal standard) were added to the reaction mixture. A final solution aliquot (1mL) was removed and centrifuged, and the supernatant was analyzed by GC for quantification of oxidation products."
6,Isolation and purification of oxidation products,"2.5 Isolation and purification of oxidation products Succeeding the MW-assisted reaction of benzyl alcohol (0.27g, 2.5mmol), 20mL of acetonitrile were added to the obtained reaction mixture followed by evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure (50°C) to obtain a crude oil. In turn, 10mL of distilled water was added to this crude and the mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2 (2×30mL) and washed by brine. The organic layers were combined and dried with MgSO4. After separation of MgSO4 by filtration and evaporation of the volatile materials under reduced pressure (50°C), the mixture was purified by flash silica gel column chromatography (n-hexane:diethyl ether=6:1) to give 0.184g (68% yield) of benzaldehyde (7a). 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ 10.06 (1H, s), 7.92–7.94 (2H, d, J = 7.4Hz), 7.71 (1H, dd), 7.61 (2H, d, J =7.6Hz). 13C NMR (CDCl3): δ 129.1, 129.4, 134.3, 136.9, 192.1. MS (EI) m/z 106 [M+]. (Similar procedure was used in the isolation of the remaining aldehydes)."
7,Computational details,"2.6 Computational details The full geometry optimization of all structures and transition states has been carried out at the DFT level of theory using the M06-2X functional [9] and 6-31G* basis set with the help of the Gaussian-09 program package [10]. It was shown [11] that the M06-2X functional demonstrates very good performance towards the main group thermochemistry reasonably treating the weak dispersion forces and, therefore, non-covalent interactions that is crucial for the systems under study. Single point calculations with the 6-311+G* basis set were then performed for the equilibrium geometries found. Final enthalpies and Gibbs free energies were calculated using the expressions H=E(6-311+G*)−E(6-31G*)+H(6-31G*) and G=E(6-311+G*)−E(6-31G*)+G(6-31G*). All calculations included the solvent effect correction using the SMD model with water taken as a solvent. No symmetry operations have been applied for any of the structures calculated. The Hessian matrix was calculated analytically for the optimized structures in order to prove the location of correct minima (no imaginary frequencies) or saddle points (only one imaginary frequency) and to estimate the thermodynamic parameters, the latter being calculated at 25°C at the ideal gas conditions. The nature of all transition states was investigated by the calculations of the intrinsic reaction coordinates (IRC) using the Gonzalez-Schlegel method [12]. The OO bond dissociation Gibbs free energy (ΔGbd) in TBHP⋯5 was calculated using equation ΣGp −Gr where Gp and Gr are the Gibbs free energies (with the corresponding entropic correction) of the radical products of decomposition and TBHP⋯5, respectively."
8,Results and discussion,"The tetrazole-amino-saccharin 5 is formed by two heterocyclic units, viz. tetrazole and benzisothiazole (saccharin), linked by an amine function. This compound was prepared using a convergent synthetic strategy whereby the two building blocks containing the heterocycles (2, 4a) were separately synthesised and then coupled to afford the target product (Scheme 1). The building blocks, tetrazoles and saccharins, themselves have relevant applications in major areas such as medicine, agriculture and food chemistry [7c]. These heterocyclic compounds are important building blocks in organic synthesis and are widely used in coordination chemistry as ligands [7c]. Furthermore, there are several tetrazolyl derivatives with a successful track record as organocatalysts. The most remarkable example is (S)-5-(pyrrolidin-2-yl)-1H-tetrazole (proline isoster) which has emerged as a ‘privileged’ organocatalyst to mediate a wide range of useful asymmetric reactions, including aldol, Michael, Mannich, α-amination reactions and so forth [13]. Worth mentioning, the synthesis of tetrazole-saccharin systems similar to 5 was found by some of us a few years ago [7a]. At the time, one of the main objectives that motivated the synthesis was the possibility of it application of these molecules systems in catalysis, either as ligands attached to a metal center or as organocatalysts. The results obtained during the study [7b] of the crystalline structure of compound 5 raised our attention to a factual possibility of its use as organocatalyst. Thus, in the solid state, 5 exists in the (2H)-2-methytetrazole-amino-saccharin tautomeric form (Fig. S1, Supplementary data). Pairs of molecules are linked in dimers through an intermolecular hydrogen bond involving the NH spacer group as proton donor and the nitrogen in position 4 of the tetrazole ring as acceptor: N12H12⋯N17′ (the symbol ′ after the atom number designates an atom belonging to a neighboring molecule). The configuration and intermolecular pattern of 5 in the solid state reveal the presence of different sites able to donate or remove electrons or protons. This observation led us to infer that this low-molecular-weight organic compound could effectively participate in the activation of some important substrates. In this context, we assumed to use the tetrazole-amino-saccharin 5 as organocatalyst toward the oxidation of benzyl alcohols in a solvent-free and microwave assisted process. Through a first assay at 150°C, with a acceptable amount of 5 (0.5mol% relatively to the alcohol), we found that the molecule exhibited a good catalytic efficiency on the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, under low power microwave radiation (20–30W) and using aqueous tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP, 70% H2O) as oxidant (Table 1 , entry 1). It is noteworthy that TBHP is an inexpensive oxidant commonly used in industry and, compared to concentrated hydrogen peroxide, is quite stable toward thermal decomposition [14]. Precisely, the thermodynamic stability of the oxidant becomes particularly important when we use microwaves as a source of heat. In other way, additional oxidants commonly tested in the oxidation of alcohols, such as urea-H2O2 (UHP), NaClO or NaIO4, consistently present worse results than either hydrogen peroxide or TBHP. Besides, microwave assisted organic synthesis is a recognized technique to reduce the reaction time, commonly by orders of magnitude, and for clean production with increasing yields. It also offers opportunities for reactions which are otherwise not feasible via conventional heating methods [15]. Encouraged by the initial catalytic activity of 5, and after optimization of reaction conditions involving benzyl alcohol 6a, we evaluated the scope of oxidation for a series of benzyl alcohol derivatives (6a–i, Table 1). Representative substrates possessing diverse substituents in the benzene ring have reacted under similar conditions to the best one (Table 1, entry 3) found for 6a, to form the correspondent aldehydes in significant yields (typically 50–70%, Table 1). For the majority of the benzyl alcohols tested, oxidation takes place in a short time period (30–40min) at temperatures not exceeding 130°C featuring considerable TOF (turnover frequency) values. Besides, the addition of the nitroxyl radical 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidyl-1-oxyl (TEMPO) to the reaction system of benzyl alcohol (6a) leads to a manifest decrease (around 50%) of the yield (Table 1, compare entries 3 and 5). The inhibitory effect of TEMPO on the alcohol oxidation process can be interpreted by the reactions illustrated in Scheme 2 . As a radical trap, TEMPO can react with free radical species (tert-butoxyl and hydroxyl radicals) generated from TBHP to form the peroxides 8 and 9. The efficiency of hydroxyl radicals for the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from alcohols, as well as their ability to oxidize nitroxides to the oxoammonium cation 10 via formation of this type of intermediates, is well documented [16]. Moreover, recently we observed the same inhibitory effect of TEMPO in the oxidation of secondary alcohols promoted by Cu(II) and Co(II) complexes [6a]. A very strong inhibitory effect was also observed when the oxidation of benzyl alcohol (6a) was carried out in presence of the carbon-radical trap CBrCl3 (Table 1, entry 6). In this circumstance, the reaction yield achieved was only 17% (Table 1, entry 6), a squat value when compared with the 75% yield (Table 1, entry 3) attained in the absence of CBrCl3. The result attained in presence of CBrCl3 is analogous to that achieved in absence of organocatalyst (14% by GC, Table 1, entry 14). In view of that, the assays performed with TEMPO and CBrCl3 suggest that the oxidation of benzyl alcohols by TBHP and promoted by derivative 5 should proceed mainly via a radical mechanism involving both oxygen- and carbon-centered radicals."
9,Theoretical studies,"3.1 Theoretical studies DFT calculations using substrate 6a as a model (non-substituted benzyl alcohol) have been performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol derivatives (6a–i) catalyzed by tetrazole-amino-saccharin 5 and to uncover a role of the organocatalyst in this process. A general mechanism was proposed using the above experimental observations, previous literature on TBHP chemistry [17] and computational results, and it is shown in Scheme 3 . The mechanism includes the homolytic OO bond cleavage in TBHP upon microwave irradiation to give tert-butoxyl ( t BuO) and hydroxyl (HO) radicals (steps 1 and 2). The latter highly reactive species abstracts the benzylic hydrogen atom from the alcohol molecule yielding the hydroxy benzyl radical, PhC(H)OH, and water (step 3). Further reaction (step 4) of this radical with an additional TBHP molecule (in the TBHP⋯5 associate) affords the t BuO radical and the geminal diol PhCH(OH)2 which, upon water elimination (step 5), is converted into the benzaldehyde PhC(H)O. 3.1.1 OO bond cleavage The calculated OO bond dissociation enthalpy in TBHP (41.2kcal/mol) is in good agreement with the experimental value (41kcal/mol) [18]. To verify if an interaction between TBHP and the organocatalyst 5 facilitates the formation of the t BuO and HO radicals, the structures of both 5 and associate TBHP⋯5 were calculated as well. Among the several possible structures of 5 (Fig. S2, Supplementary data), isomer 5a was found to be the most stable in H2O solution. The structure of this isomer corresponds to the experimental X-ray solid state data [7b]. In the associate TBHP⋯5, the molecules of TBHP and 5 are linked by two NH⋯O and OH⋯N hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1 ). Additionally, there is another H⋯O contact which is shorter than the sum of van der Waals radii of the hydrogen and oxygen atoms (2.59Å vs. 2.72Å). A different structure of TBHP⋯5 in which the NH group of 5 forms an H-bond with the terminal O atom of TBHP is less stable by 1.3kcal/mol. The OO bond dissociation Gibbs free energy (ΔGbd) in TBHP⋯5 was calculated for two decomposition models, viz.: (i) decomposition into the tert-butoxyl radical bound with 5 ( t BuO⋯5) and separate free HO and (ii) decomposition into the hydroxyl radical bound with 5 (HO⋯5) and isolated free t BuO (Scheme 4 ). In both cases, the calculated ΔGbd is even slightly higher to that found for the free TBHP molecule without an involvement of derivative 5 (31.4–31.5kcal/mol vs. 30.4kcal/mol). The ΔG value for radical formation was also calculated for the decomposition of TBHP⋯BzOH (i.e. without organocatalyst) and TBHP⋯5 into triplet associates t BuO⋯HO•••BzOH and t BuO ⋯5⋯HO (Scheme 3, step 2) respectively, in which both radicals and 5 or the solvent molecule are linked by H-bond(s). The calculated ΔG value for OO bond cleavage is also slightly higher (by 1.3kcal/mol) in the presence of 5. Thus, the organocatalyst 5 does not facilitate the generation of the HO and t BuO radicals, and its role should be expressed at later stages of the reaction. 3.1.2 Hydrogen abstraction The HO radical is a highly reactive species which has very short lifetime until it reacts with other species existing in a solution. Therefore, in the real solution, associates t BuO ⋯5⋯HO or t BuO⋯HO⋯BzOH initially formed upon the OO bond cleavage in TBHP⋯5 or TBHP⋯BzOH do not have sufficient time to decompose until the bound HO reacts with benzyl alcohol. This situation resembles the rebound mechanism established for the hydrocarbon hydroxylation with Cytochrome P450 [19]. The HO radical bound in t BuO⋯5⋯HO or t BuO⋯HO⋯BzOH can abstract the benzylic hydrogen atom from the alcohol to give the hydroxy benzyl radical PhC(H)OH and water. Transition states TS1c and TS1u for such catalyzed and uncatalyzed hydrogen abstractions, respectively, were found (Fig. 1). The calculated activation barriers (ΔG≠) of the H-abstraction are 3.3 and 7.8kcal/mol (see Fig. 2 ) for the catalyzed and uncatalyzed processes, respectively, demonstrating the pronounced effect of the organocatalyst in this reaction step. The formation of PhC(H)OH in this step is highly exergonic with the ΔG values of −34.7 and −34.2kcal/mol. Alternatively, the benzylic hydrogen atom may be abstracted from BzOH by the t BuO radical bound in t BuO⋯5⋯HO via TS1c’ to give PhC(H)OH and t BuOH. However, this process is by 1.9kcal/mol less favorable than the abstraction by the HO radical. Two radicals, t BuO and PhC(H)OH, formed in this step may also undergo recombination to give t BuOCH(OH)Ph which upon hydrolysis and water elimination transforms into benzaldehyde. However, taking into account the low concentrations and the high reactivity of these radicals, the probability of their trapping by the reagent, solvent, oxidant, catalyst or molecular oxygen is much higher than that of their encounter, and therefore, such a recombination step is not expected to be the main reaction channel. 3.1.3 Formation of aldehyde The PhC(H)OH radical should react at the benzylic carbon atom with an additional TBHP molecule to give the geminal diol PhCH(OH)2 via TS2c or TS2u (Fig. 1) with a concomitant cleavage of the OO bond and formation of the t BuO radical. The activation energies for this step are 19.6 and 22.1kcal/mol for the catalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions (Fig. 2). The diol is then converted into benzaldehyde upon water elimination. No transition state was found for an alternative concerted process of the hydroxyl hydrogen abstraction from PhC(H)OH by TBHP to give PhC(H)=O, t BuO and H2O. 3.1.4 Non-radical mechanism The oxidation of alcohols into aldehydes with peroxides is a two-electron redox process. Hence, for this reaction, a non-radical mechanism may also be proposed. Such a mechanism includes the heterolytic OO bond cleavage in the TBHP⋯BzOH (or TBHP⋯5) molecule with a simultaneous proton abstraction from benzyl alcohol by the liberating OH anion (Scheme 5 ). For this pathway, transition states TS3c and TS3u (Fig. 1) for the catalyzed and uncatalyzed processes, respectively, were found. The IRC calculations and subsequent geometry optimizations from the last points indicated that the final products of this step are the geminal diol PhCH(OH)2, t BuOH and, for TS3c, a tautomer of the organocatalyst with one of the tetrazole nitrogens to be protonated (5′) (Scheme 5). Thus, the OO bond cleavage, the CO bond formation and several proton transfers occur simultaneously at one step. Meanwhile, the energies of both TS3c and TS3u are higher than those of the corresponding transition states of the radical mechanism (TS1c and TS1u) by 8.3 and 8.2kcal/mol, respectively (Fig. 2). In this context, the non-radical mechanism is less favorable than the radical one for both catalyzed and uncatalyzed processes. 3.1.5 Energy profile and the role of the organocatalyst Analysis of the energy profiles for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol by TBHP with and without organocatalyst (Fig. 2) indicates that the rate limiting steps of the whole reaction are the OO bond cleavage and subsequent hydrogen abstraction from benzyl alcohol (BzOH). The overall activation barrier of the process is determined by the energy of TS1c or TS1u. Organocatalyst 5 does not facilitate the homolytic OO bond cleavage in TBHP. Instead, the role of the organocatalyst in this reaction is the facilitation of the H-abstraction from BzOH by the bound HO radical – one of the reaction steps which provides a contribution to the overall activation barrier. As a result, the overall activation barriers of the catalyzed and uncatalyzed reaction are 41.7 and 44.9kcal/mol. Note that the difference of these barriers, 3.2kcal/mol, corresponds to the ratio of the reaction rate coefficients of more than 200. Additionally, 5 facilitates the conversion of PhC(H)OH into diol by 1.2kcal/mol – the step which should also provide some contribution to the effective rate constant of the overall process. Even for the catalyzed reaction, the overall activation barrier is rather high that correlates with the experimental observations. Indeed, in the absence of microwave radiation, the yield of the product at the same conditions is very low (Table 1, entry 16). However, the MW irradiation permits the successful overcome this barrier due to rapid and strong local overheating, pressure enhancement and possible nonthermal effects on the preexponential factor in the Arrhenius equation."
10,Conclusions,"To conclude, we have demonstrated that the simple and low-weigth organic molecule 3-((2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)amino)benzisothiazole 1,1-dioxide (5), a tetrazole-amino-saccharin, can be successfully applied as catalyst for the oxidation of benzyl alcohols into the corresponding aldehydes, in a solvent-free and microwave assisted process using TBHP as oxidant. Experimental evidence supported by DFT calculations indicates that the oxidation of benzyl alcohols proceeds via a free radical mechanism. Activation of the substrates by the organocatalyst should occur at the stage of H-abstracting from benzyl alcohol with consequent formation of a benzylic C-centered free radical. The amino and tetrazole functions of the organocatalyst, possibly associated to its conformational rigidity, play an important role in the main reaction steps. The synthesis of novel azole-saccharin derivatives to be used as organocatalysts in other synthetic methodologies is under way in our laboratories."
