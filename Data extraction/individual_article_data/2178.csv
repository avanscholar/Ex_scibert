0,Introduction,"Consumption of primary energy worldwide reached 13.86 billion metric tons of oil equivalents in 2018 [1]. Global energy consumption has never been higher due to population growth and social development [2,3]. Fossil fuels accounted for more than three-quarters of consumption [4], leading to environmental impact through global warming and climate change, which is a major concern of our age [5]. Therefore, most researchers are primarily interested in renewable energy sources, such as solar, hydroelectric, hydrogen, wind, and biomass [6–8]. In recent years, renewable energy has become a more frequently used source of primary energy, and worldwide investment in clean energy has nearly doubled [1]. Global demand for primary biomass energy is predicted to increase from 26.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2020 to 35.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2040 [4]. Biomass is the principal source of renewable energy, and biomass liquid fuels have great potential to satisfy future energy requirements [9]. Triglycerides are composed of three long hydrocarbon chains attached to one glycerol molecule, and this molecular structure is similar to that of petroleum crude oil, making it an important alternative feedstock for use in place of petroleum [10–12]. Triglycerides occur widely in vegetable oils, animal fats, and microalgal plants, providing a huge raw material resource for transformation into drop-in fuels [2]. As early as 1900, during the Paris Exposition, peanut oil was used as a liquid fuel in a diesel engine for the first time [13,14]. In the 1930s and 1940s, a mixture of fatty acid ethyl esters produced from palm-tree oil was used as a substitute for petroleum diesel [15]. In 1947, tung oil was cracked to form hydrocarbons in China, which could be used as a liquid fuel [16]. Current combustion engines are not suitable for the direct use of high-viscosity vegetable oils, since they can cause problems of coking of the injectors, carbon deposits, oil ring sticking, and thickening of lubricating oils [17,18]. Conversion of triglycerides into upgraded, high-quality products is an essential prerequisite for their use as fuels [2]. For example, triglycerides are transesterified and free fatty acids are esterified to produce fatty acid methyl esters by using homogeneous or heterogeneous metal catalysts, enzyme catalysts, or photocatalysts [19–24]. However, some aspects still need to be improved, including cold-flow properties, oxidative stability, and low calorific value when using ester-based biodiesel [25,26]. Other methods for producing hydrocarbon-based liquid fuels, such as thermal cracking [2,27–29] and hydrogenation conversion [30–38], have also been utilized. Such technologies can yield hydrocarbons suitable for direct use as high-heat-value fuels, such as green diesel [6,39–43] and aviation biofuels [27,28,44–47]. This paper presents a brief overview of technologies for the conversion of triglycerides, including transesterification, thermal cracking, and hydrogenation, carried out by using basic or acid catalysts, enzyme catalysts, heterogeneous catalysts, or photocatalysts. The raw materials, catalyst choice, and reaction mechanisms for the different methods of high-quality fuel production are discussed. Some typical biodiesel production technologies and processes are analyzed. Upgrading methods for the conversion of green diesel into low cold-filter-point upgraded biofuels are also discussed. Life cycle assessment and greenhouse gas emissions in relation to biodiesel production are then analyzed. We also examine the prospects for future preparation of high-value biofuels based on triglycerides. Understanding the different triglyceride conversion methods should provide a significant guide for future research work."
1,Triglyceride raw materials,"Triglycerides occur widely in animal fats and plant oils and have been used as raw materials for biofuel production. Animal fats are mainly derived from fish oil, lard, chicken oil, butter, and so on, which are solids at room temperature. As shown in Table 1 , animal fats are characterized by a high saturated fatty acid content, and in their original form cannot be directly used as fuels for diesel engines [48]. Vegetable oils are also a significant source of triglycerides for energy fuels, and have been studied for many years, most commonly soybean oil [49], rapeseed or canola oil [50,51], palm oil [52], olive oil [53–55] and sunflower oil [56,57]. Generally, vegetable oils contain more unsaturated fatty acids, with good low-temperature fluidity, making them more suitable for the produce of biofuels. As further important sources of triglycerides, non-edible and waste oils, such as tung [58], pongamia [59], karanji [60], jatropha [61], castor [62], and cotton seed oils [63], as well as waste cooking oil [64,65] and acidic oil [66], are prime candidates for fuel production. The salient properties of common vegetable oils and fats are listed in Table 1. It has been shown that almost all triglycerides are composed of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids [12]. The fatty acids in triglycerides are typically palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic (octadecanoic) acid (C18:0), oleic acid (C18:1), linoleic acid (C18:2), arachidic acid (C20:0), eicosenoic acid (C20:1), and behenic acid (C22:0). Moreover, most triglycerides mainly contain the first four of these acids. Among the various kinds of triglyceride sources, palm oil is a sustainable oil mainly produced in Southeast Asia, and makes up the largest share of plant oils worldwide [75,76], accounting for 34% production and 33% consumption among all plant oils [77]. Due to its low cost and highest yield per hectare, palm oil is a potential feedstock for producing biofuels [78]. Sunflower and rapeseed oil are two further important vegetable oils, which mainly contain unsaturated fatty acids. The main producing areas of sunflower oil are concentrated in the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Argentina, Turkey, and Europe [79]. Sunflower oil has become a prime choice for biofuel production because it has a shorter cultivation period than other oil-producing crops [80]. Rapeseed oil is produced in many countries [81]. It is also known as canola oil; the name “canola” comes from a pairing of the words “[can]adian [o]il [l]ow [a]cid”, with Canada being the largest producer. Subsequent major producer countries are Germany, China, and India, producing approximately 7–10 million tonnes per year [81]. Besides the above oils, soybean oil is also widely used as a raw material for biofuel production. The United States is the largest producer of soybean oil, accounting for approximately 47% (16.4 million tonnes) of the global production [82]. Various kinds of non-edible and waste oils have also been investigated for transformation into biofuels. Tung oil originated in China, where approximately 100000 tons are produced annually, accounting for 70% of global production [83]. Jatropha oil is an oil-producing tree species suitable for biodiesel production, also grown in China. It can be grown in dry areas, and its seeds contain around 25–30 wt% jatropha oil. China plans to plant jatropha oil trees on 1.5 million hm2 in 2020 [84–86]. Another important non-edible oil is microalgal oil, which shows a photosynthetic efficiency of about 10–20 times higher than those of other oil crops, leading to much faster biomass generation and CO2 sequestration [40,87]. Moreover, it can adapt to variable waste water sources and does not require arable land [69,87–89]. Microalgal oil has shown tremendous potential with the best growth rates. Yet, it also has some drawbacks, microalgal oil is more expensive than any of the other oils, due to typical growth rates being much lower than the highest observed values and the expensive infrastructure needed to cultivate, harvest, and dewater the algae biomass. Acidic oil and waste cooking oil are produced during the processing and consumption of edible oil. The use of these two oils can address the problem of their environmental pollution or degradation and waste treatment [29]. Approximately 0.55–1.6 million tons per year of waste cooking oil is being produced due to increasing food consumption in China [90]. Compared with conventional triglycerides, waste cooking oil contains large amounts of water, impurities, and free fatty acids, which affect its viscosity, acid value, and stability. Hence, pretreatment is needed before the conversion process [28,91]."
2,Technologies for the conversion of triglycerides,
3,Transesterification (esterification) of triglycerides to produce biodiesel,"3.1 Transesterification (esterification) of triglycerides to produce biodiesel In the transesterification reaction, triglyceride and various short-chain alcohols undergo transesterification under the action of a catalyst to obtain fatty acid methyl esters and glycerol, as shown in Fig. 2 [92,93]. Transesterification conversions include acid-catalyzed conversion, base-catalyzed conversion, enzyme-catalyzed conversion, and photocatalytic conversion. Compared with petroleum, the esters produced by transesterification have superior features, including non-toxicity, biodegradability, and low levels of nitrogen and sulfur, which reduces environmental pollution [36,94–97]. Currently, the transesterification process is used to produce biodiesel, with large-scale production being conducted in the Americas, Europe, and Southeast Asia. In 2019, the US and Brazil were the two largest biodiesel producers in the world, with yields of 6.5 and 5.9 billion liters, respectively. Argentina produced around 2.5 billion liters of biodiesel in 2019 [98]. Europe is also a large biodiesel production area, with France producing approximately 3.0 billion liters [98]. In Southeast Asia, it is estimated that the total crude palm oil feedstock for biodiesel production amounted to 1.5 billion liters in Malaysia in 2019 [99]. Other Southeast Asian countries, such as Indonesia and Thailand, are also large palm oil producers and blended biodiesel consumers. 3.1.1 Transesterification by acid or basic catalysts A conventional industrial method based on a homogeneous catalyst, such as NaOH and KOH, is used for the transesterification of plant oils (such as palm oil and sunflower oil). The transesterification reaction is a reversible process, and excess alcohol can shift the equilibrium towards the product so that the actual amount of alcohol used is much greater than its stoichiometric ratio. The transesterification process involves a series of reactions, whereby triglycerides are gradually converted into diglycerides and monoglycerides, and finally into glycerol, each reaction producing an ester. Alcohols that can be used for transesterification include methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, and pentanol. The most commonly used is methanol, due to its low cost, short carbon chain, and strong polarity. The use of a methanol/ethanol mixture for transesterification may be beneficial, taking advantage of the excellent solvent performance of ethanol and the faster equilibrium conversion rate of methanol [100]. On the other hand, long-chain alcohols have proven to be beneficial for improving the cold-flow-point performance of biodiesel [101]. It should be noted that most non-edible and waste oils, important renewable feedstocks for biodiesel production, usually contain a large amounts of free fatty acids, which may cause a saponification reaction with basic catalysts, leading to their deactivation, hampering biodiesel purification and lowering its yield [95,102–104]. To overcome this, an additional pretreatment step, such as esterification, wasmay be carried out by using acid catalysts, such as H2SO4, to convert free fatty acids in a pretreatment process. The. However, the traditional pretreatment approach requires an excess of alcohol, increasing the material cost. Moreover, acid catalysts such as H2SO4 are highly corrosive to equipment, and the multiple purification processes and complicated increase operation the technical cost97, [105,106]. An improved approach involves dilution with glycerol and further reaction to form glycerol stearate at above 200 °C. Such pretreatment processes can effectively convert free fatty acids into triglycerides. Dow Dupont USA has also been engaged in the research and development of resin dehydration pretreatment of biodiesel feedstocks, aiming for the dehydration of raw oils and fats, and refining biodiesel products (removing impurities such as water, soap, and glycerides that have not been fully transesterified). 3.1.2 Transesterification by heterogeneous catalysts Compared with homogeneous catalysts, heterogeneous catalysts are recyclable and separable, eliminating purification and separation steps to reducing the cost and pollution, making them promising catalysts for transesterification processes [96]. Heterogeneous catalysts, such as metal and mixed-metal oxide (CaO, ZnO, MgO, and hydrotalcite) catalysts [107–109], modified mesoporous silica [110–112], ion-exchange resin [113,114], carbon-based catalysts [96], zeolites [115–117], and transition metal compounds [73,118], have been synthesized for transesterification processes. As listed in Table 2 , Foroutan et al. [19] transesterified waste oil by using a CaO@MgO catalyst, which obtaining a high biodiesel conversion of up to 98.37%, and the catalyst remained active over 3 cycles. Nonetheless, these catalysts also have some drawbacks, such as eventual deactivation, unsatisfactory activity, site leaching, and complex preparation processes. Mariam AlSharifi et al., by using Li/Zn-Cb2 transesterification waste canola oil, catalysts performance greatly stability, even after 7 times cycles used with the FAME products content over 96% [73]. And Arghyadeep De et al., prepared Cu/TiO2 catalyst converted the palm oil under the milder reaction condition at 45 °C, 45min, the conversion rate can reach up to 90% [119]. More homogeneous catalysts were used in transesterification conversion for biodiesel production. Nowadays, ever more research is being devoted to solid basic catalysts. CaO-based solid basic catalysts are common and popular, characterized by strong basicity, ease of preparation, and cost-effectiveness [19]. However, preparing a solid base catalyst that simultaneously shows high activity and good stability remains a challenge. Pure CaO shows the low activity as a transesterification catalyst because few active sites are exposed as a single-crystal solid phase [120]. Furthermore, if CaO is dissolved in methanol, the by-product glycerol will bind to Ca2+ ions, leading to a loss of active sites [121]. To improve the stability of catalysts, the transformation of a single-crystal solid phase to a composite crystalline solid phase, such as calcium/magnesia feldspar or perovskite spinel, is necessary. This increases the specific surface area of the catalyst, and the active sites are dispersed, thereby improving the activity. Liu et al. [107] successfully synthesized a magnetic nanoparticle catalyst coated with CaO (MgFe2O4@CaO) (Fig. 3 ), which showed improved activity, higher acid resistance, and better water resistance due to the synergy between magnesium and calcium. The initial yield of biodiesel was 98.3%, and the yield still reached 89% after fivefold reuse. In summary, the development directions and trends in solid base catalysts are to synthesize highly active and highly stable CaO-based supported catalysts, increase the specific surface area and the number of active sites, and improve the stability of catalysts modifying the crystalline solid phase [122,123]. 3.1.3 Production processes The biodiesel production technologies based on esters have been developed for many years and mature in industry production. Most production processes use vegetable oils and waste oils as feedstock, and liquid alkali catalysts as transesterification catalysts. Traditional industrial production technologies include Lurgi and IFP (French Institute of Petroleum) processes [128,129], main process flow are shown in Fig. 4 . Lurgi, a German company, its transesterification process is the most widely used in the world. Lurgi Biodiesel [130] is a proven technology for producing biodiesel from vegetable oils or animal fats, the typical feedstock is rapeseed, soya, tallow or palm oil. The technology operates at 65 °C under atmospheric pressure. In this process, oil and methanol are reacted in a two-stage mixer/settler arrangement, secondary glycerol refining reduces catalyst consumption, recycled methanol reduces costs, closed-loop water washing and recycling minimizes waste water [128]. Furthermore, after yield fully optimized, which can perform with 1 kg (kg) of feedstock producing 1 kg of biodiesel. Crude glycerol is the main co-product with a purity of more than 80%. Over 75 biodiesel production companies worldwide utilize Lurgi biodiesel production technology, mainly distributed in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, New Delhi and Kobe [131]. IFP process with two successive stages of reaction and glycerol separation, and such process use ion-exchange resins as glycerol traps, which can eliminate the water wash step also minimizes wastewater. Moreover, the final products biodiesel and glycerol can reach up to a high purity [132]. IFP biodiesel technology also has been performance industry production in Sweden, The United States and Spain et al. Other technologies have also been developed, such as the Crown biodiesel process, which uses a multistep transesterification reaction followed by neutralizing and washing steps, which can converts nearly 100% of the triglycerides in the oil fat to biodiesel (methyl ester) [133]. Then, methyl ester is stripped to remove the water and methanol, and final step is to chill and filter the methyl ester which can remove impurities that form at low temperatures. The QS biodiesel process is only a single-step reaction that can use varying quality feedstock, the company calls its technology Co-Sol-Plus, it provides that can reduction in transesterification processing time for 20–50%, and reduction 20–40% energy consumption compared to standard transesterification processes [134]. The BIOx process uses alcohol and THF as co-solvent to deal with the high FFA content feedstock, but such solvent with hazardous and toxicity [135]. Kreido biofuels STT (spinning tube-in-tube) process, only with a one-stage reactor, can produce the high purity glycerol and reduce biodiesel production cost. Due to green biodiesel having a broader application, technological development tends to hydrogenated oils and fats to produce green diesel (mentioned in section 3.3.5). 3.1.4 Transesterification by enzymatic catalysts Besides homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, enzyme catalysts are also widely used in the preparation of biodiesel. Compared with chemical conversion, transesterification by enzymatic catalysts has the following advantages [24,136–141]: (1) enzyme-catalyzed conversion is usually carried out under mild reaction conditions (<60 °C, atmospheric pressure) with low energy consumption; (2) side reactions, such as saponification, are avoided, improving the purity of the final product and making it easier to separate from by-products; (3) no solid waste or wastewater is produced, resulting in an environmentally friendly process. Therefore, biodiesel production through enzymatic transesterification has attracted much attention. Currently, lipases are the most commonly used enzyme catalysts in biodiesel production, which exist in animals, plants, and microorganisms. Due to their low cost, short incubation period, and higher yields, microbial lipases purified from bacterial, yeast, fungal, and algal resources have been widely investigated [26,142,143]. Theoretically, a ping-pong bi bi mechanism is widely accepted for lipase enzymatic conversion of triglycerides [142,144]. Firstly, nucleophilic addition generates an enzyme-substrate complex, and then glycerol is formed when the conjugate acid of the amine provides protons, and the alkyl oxygen atom of the substrate accepts the protons. Therefter, the oxygen atom of a methanol molecule adds to the carbon atom of the CO of the acyl-enzyme to form an enzyme–alcohol complex structure. Finally, the oxygen atom of the enzyme is eliminated, protons are transferred from the conjugate acid of the amine, and the biodiesel product is obtained. Transesterification processes by enzymatic catalysts are influenced by many factors, including reaction temperature, solvents (especially methanol), glycerol, lipase immobilization, and so on [145]. Enzymatic temperature is usually in the range 20–60 °C; low temperature will limit the lipase activity, whereas high temperature may destroy its molecular structure [146]. Traditionally, disulfide bonds are introduced to improve the thermal stability of lipases [147]. Polar solvents such as methanol, which can induce changes in the overall structure and active site conformation of lipase, tend to decrease its activity. To overcome this problem, the following methods are effective options: (i) screening for alcohol-resistant lipases; (ii) addition of ethanol to reduce the toxicity of methanol; (iii) directed evolution (Fig. 5 ) and rational design; (iv) immobilization (to enhance the stability of the lipase structure, further improving its alcohol resistance). As a by-product, glycerol may also cause enzyme deactivation, and it is important to control the molar ratio of acyl acceptor to oil [148]. The hydrophilicity of glycerol may lead to its adsorption on lipase; it needs to be removed during biodiesel synthesis or can be separated from the product at the end of the reaction. Generally, high-quality strains can be obtained by directional modification of lipase in different regions, including the thermally stable region, the alcohol tolerance zone, and the active area (Fig. 6 a). Currently, research is focused on the following points(Fig. 6): (i) protein engineering technology, aimed at directed modification of the lipase solvent channel site to improve the methanol tolerance of the enzyme [149–152]; (ii) genetic engineering, aimed at regulation of the integrated copy number, transcription, and translation level of the lipase, and its increased expression [153–155]; (iii) construction of whole-cell catalysts, selecting the high-display GPI protein as the anchoring protein to increase the display efficiency of the cell surface [156–158]; (iv) selection of a complex enzyme system with a synergistic effect for co-display, to improve the catalytic efficiency [159,160]. Cao et al. [152] used glucose as an additive in lipase-catalyzed transesterification to improve stability and methanol tolerance (Fig. 6b). Glucose molecules self-assemble on the surface of proteins through hydrogen-bonding and van der Waals forces and are also among the surface residues that protect the protein structure from the effects of the environment. Heater et al. genetically fused Proteus mirabilis lipase to Cry3Aa, allowing the directed evolution of lipase through genetically encoded immobilization; the improved Cry3Aa–PML catalyst for the conversion of waste cooking oil to produce biodiesel could be reused over 15 cycles [154]. Korman et al. [161] employed directed evolution to obtain lipase Dieselzyme 4, which showed excellent thermal stability and methanol tolerance. Compared to the wild-type enzyme, the half-inactivation time was increased 30 times at 50 °C and increased 50 times in 50% aqueous methanol solution. A Pichia pastoris whole-cell biocatalyst was prepared by modification and used for the transesterification of soybean oil to produce biodiesel at 25 °C, at which the ester yield reached 60.7% [158]. Ashjari et al. [160] immobilized Rhizomucor miehei and Thermomyces lanuginosa lipases on aldehyde-functionalized supports through multicomponent reactions. Compared with the free lipases, the thermal and co-solvent stabilities of their immobilized forms were increased, and they showed high reusability after five cycles. Lipases are invariably immobilized through covalent bonds or hydrogen bonds, which can enhance the stability of their structures, further enhance their capacity for reuse, and lower production costs [162–164]. On the other hand, lipases immobilized on carriers such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), active carbon, silica, or magnetic nanoparticles, through hydrophobic modification, show greatly reduced adsorption of glycerol, which improves their activity [137,160,165]. Hu et al. [165] immobilized Aspergillus niger lipase on a typical MOF (UiO-66), whereupon its hydrophobicity was improved; after ten successive cycles, it still retained 83.0% of its original activity (Fig. 7 ). Hu et al. [147] also immobilized Aspergillus niger lipase on M-ZIF-8 and M-ZIF-8-PDMS; hydrophobic macropores were formed in macroporous ZIF-8, which greatly suppressed glycerol adsorption. Besides immobilization methods, other techniques, such as enzyme pretreatment or post-treatment, combinations of lipases, and reactor design, have also been applied to improve biodiesel production [145]. Enzyme-catalyzed transesterification has a more complex reaction mechanism, leading to increased reaction times. This is in addition to the time required for cultivation of the lipases, which extends the time consumption of the process [166]. Thus, developing a high reactivity, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly enzymatic catalyst for biodiesel production in a reduced reaction time is the key goal of enzymatic conversion research [24]. 3.1.5 Esterification by photocatalysts In 1972, the discovery of the “Honda–Fujishima effect” opened a new chapter in photocatalysis research [167]. Photocatalytic conversion of fatty acids into biodiesel catalyzed by SiO2-supported Cr was reported by Corro et al. [38]. As illustrated in Fig. 8 , under solar irradiation at 35 °C, Cr/SiO2 photocatalyst can absorb photo-generated electrons e− and holes h+ due to the cooperative interaction of Cr3+ and Cr6+ moieties. The photo-generated holes h+ react with CH3OH to produce CH3O· radicals. Simultaneously, R–COOH and O2 react with electrons e− to form R–COOH· and superoxide species (·O2), respectively. Subsequently, R–COOH· reacts with CH3O· to produce methyl esters as components of biodiesel. This photo-catalyst showed great stability after tenfold reuse and enabled good conversion of the free fatty acid."
4,Pyrolysis or thermal cracking of triglycerides to produce pyrolytic oil,"3.2 Pyrolysis or thermal cracking of triglycerides to produce pyrolytic oil Pyrolysis or thermal cracking processes are conversion methods of triglycerides under external heating to produce hydrocarbons with or without a catalyst [168]. Such processes are usually carried out in the temperature range of 300–500 °C under atmospheric pressure [2]. This technique has several significant advantages over other methods, including feedstock flexibility (no need for pretreatment to remove impurities), cost-efficient catalysts (such as CaO, Na2CO3), no consumption of hydrogen, and the final hydrocarbon products have a similar chemical composition to that of petroleum oil [28,169–171]. Hence, the pyrolysis or thermal cracking method is considered one of the most promising for refining triglycerides [170]. 3.2.1 Uncatalyzed cracking Uncatalyzed cracking of triglycerides is carried out at 300–500 °C [172]. During the cracking process, complex reactions such as dehydration, decarboxylation, decarbonylation, fragmentation, polymerization, and rearrangement take place, leading to complex chemical products, including linear paraffin, cyclic paraffin, alkenes, aromatics, and fatty acids [10,29,173]. However, uncatalyzed cracking is always accompanied by low deoxygenation efficiency, leading to produce high acid values oil products [2,28]. The high-acid-value pyrolysis oil produced from non-catalytic cracking does not meet the requirements for fuel use [2]. 3.2.2 Cracking over basic catalysts Basic catalysts, such as CaO and Na2CO3, can be used to produce low-acid-value biofuels, since they are effective in deoxygenation [27,174–178]. As listed in Table 3 , the acid number of acidic waste oil is reduced from 77 mg KOH·g−1 to below 10 mg KOH·g−1 following catalysis by CaO and Na2CO3 [29]. The mechanism involves reaction of fatty acids with the basic catalyst to form fatty acid salts, which then decompose into various organic hydrocarbons through different reaction pathways, such as bond cleavage, disproportionation, isomerization, hydrogen abstraction, and aromatization (Fig. 9 ) [29,173,179]. It is worthy of mention that researchers have investigated bond dissociation energies (BDEs) through density functional theory (DFT) calculations using fatty acid salts as model compounds. By introducing alkali metal cations into the fatty acids, the BDE of the α carbon-carbon bond is lowered, allowing for the effective removal of carboxyl groups (Fig. 9 a) [10]. DFT calculations showed that metal ions could influence the BDEs in the decomposition of triglycerides. Long et al. [180] investigated the changing trend in activation energies for model fatty acid salts tested by a thermogravimetric analysis method. Their results showed that decomposition activation energies varied in the range 80–260 kJ/mol, confirming that metal ions substantially affect the dynamic pyrolytic behavior (Fig. 9 b). Thermal decomposition of the tin salt of the fatty acid required the lowest activation energy, and by using SnO, the catalytic cracking of soybean oil could be accomplished at the lowest reaction temperature. Fatty acid salts are deoxygenated through decarboxylation (DCO2) and decarbonylation (DCO) pathways to form long-chain fatty acid-free radicals, which then can be dehydrogenated to obtain terminal olefins and hydrogen radicals. Under high-temperature conditions, terminal olefins are further converted into linear paraffin, cyclic paraffin, and aromatics (Fig. 10 ). The proposed mechanism implies that terminal olefins are important reaction intermediates. According to product analysis data, olefins are the main products, accounting for 40%, of which terminal olefins account for around half. Olefins, especially terminal olefins, are important platform compounds with enormous potential for the molecular design of materials and energy applications. Hence, further research on base-catalyzed cracking of triglycerides should focus on improving the yield of olefins and their rectification and separation, as this imparts the pyrolytic products with higher economic value. Importantly, products with high olefins contents can easier be aromatized and isomerized for biofuel production. 3.2.3 Cracking over molecular sieve catalysts Using molecular sieves such as ZSM-5, NaY, USY, MCM-41, and SBA-15 (Fig. 11 ), linear hydrocarbons can be further converted into aromatics and isomeric hydrocarbons to improve fuel properties. Currently, zeolite ZSM-5 (Fig. 11a) is widely applied for the catalytic cracking of triglycerides [169,170,181], having advantages of i) strong acidity, coupled with a remarkable shape-selectivity for aromatic products, and ii) a three-dimensional well-connected micropore system, allowing it to crack coke precursors while maintaining high thermal stability [171,181]. However, ZSM-5 shows a greater tendency to form a gas fraction, especially for aromatics, due to its small pore size and high acidity [27,169]. Thus, the use of ZSM-5 will reduce the yield of liquid products, but the high aromatic hydrocarbon content makes the oil suitable for aviation biofuel production. Fangling et al. [10,27,28] used ZSM-5 to crack triglycerides to produce a liquid fuel that showed great potential for aviation fuel applications. Zeolites such as NaY and USY have also been used as cracking catalysts. Lu et al. [182] cracked rubber seed oil by using NaY and USY to obtain liquid fuel products. In this process, zeolite USY showed high catalytic activity and stability after six cycles. Other petroleum refinery technologies have employed mesoporous molecular sieves such as MCM-41 and SBA-15 [169,177,183,184]. MCM-41 has a high specific surface area and a regular pore structure with a size distribution in the range of 1.3–50 nm. The large pore size is more suitable for the diffusion of triglyceride molecules, and the carbon chains of its pyrolysis products are distributed around C12, making them suitable to produce green diesel. Compared with MCM-41, SBA-15 has thicker walls, endowing it with good stability. An important issue is that molecular sieve catalysts cannot always remove O atoms during the reaction, leading to pyrolysis oil with a high acid value. Therefore, composite catalysts have been prepared with a basic metal (such as Mg, Zn, Cu, or Ca) and its oxide (such as MgO, ZnO, CuO, or CaO) loaded onto mesoporous molecular sieves for high-value liquid fuel production (Fig. 11 b) [169,177,183–185]. Such composite catalysts can reduce the acid value of the liquid fraction while maintaining a high production yield (Table 3)."
5,Hydrogenation of triglycerides to produce hydrogenated oil,"3.3 Hydrogenation of triglycerides to produce hydrogenated oil Hydrogenation of plant oils is an alternative method for green diesel production. Compared with other techniques, hydrogenation can yield linear liquid hydrocarbons with a high cetane number that can be directly used as a transportation fuel [186]. Hydrogenation is typically carried out at 350–450 °C under an H2 pressure of 4–15 MPa using a heterogeneous catalyst [187]. Hydrogenation proceeds by the pathway shown in Fig. 12 [187–190]. Firstly, the unsaturated CC bonds of the triglycerides are hydrogenated to form saturated triglycerides. Secondly, further hydrogenation of the saturated triglycerides affords fatty acids and propane. Carboxylic acid groups must then be removed to yield long-carbon-chain paraffin, and this can be carried out through three deoxygenation pathways, namely decarboxylation (DCO2), decarbonylation (DCO), and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO). The catalytic conversion of fatty acids is mainly achieved by adsorption of the ester end on the catalyst surface and deoxygenation under suitable hydrogen pressure. The DCO2 pathway involves decomposition of the ester group into RCOO· and H·, α-C-C bond scission with the loss of CO2 to furnish a long carbon chain, and further reaction with H· to produce alkanes (Fig. 13 a). In the DCO pathway, the hydroxyl group of the acid reacts with H2 to afford H2O and a ketene, and then the other O atom is removed in the form of CO to produce an alkane (Fig. 13 b). Both the DCO2 and DCO pathways result in the loss of one carbon atom, whereas in the HDO route, reduction with H2 generates hydrocarbons without losing a carbon atom. Subsequent reactions of the fatty acid produce ketone, aldehyde, alcohol, and 3 mol of H2O (Fig. 13 c). H2 consumption decreases in the order HDO > DCO > DCO2. Thus, the HDO process has a higher H2 cost, but DCO and DCO2 produce non-environmentally favorable CO2 and CO, affecting catalyst activity. Hydrogenation catalysts, such as metal-based sulfides (phosphides, carbides, and nitrides), noble metals, non-noble metals, and bimetallic catalysts, have been investigated. These catalysts can facilitate the hydrodeoxygenation of triglycerides through different deoxygenation pathways (DCO, DCO2, and HDO). 3.3.1 Metal-based sulfide/phosphide/carbide/nitride catalysts Metal sulfide catalysts have been widely used for the desulfurization and denitrification of petroleum, and as commercial catalysts for the hydrogenation of triglycerides. According to the deoxygenation mechanism shown in Fig. 13 d, a metal sulfide catalyst reacts with a fatty acid, leaving a sulfur vacancy or coordinatively unsaturated site, which can facilitate highly enhanced desulfurization and denitrogenation activity, especially in combination with another metal modifier, such as Ni or Mo [193,194]. Researchers have applied NiMoS x for the hydrodeoxygenation of soybean oil, producing C17 and C18 hydrocarbons with high conversions and selectivities exceeding 90% (Table 4 ), whereby the final products could potentially be used as biodiesel. Loading sulfides on a catalyst can improve its stability, further decreasing operational costs [187,195]. However, some sulfur is likely to appear in the product, causing a pollution problem when the fuel is burned [196]. On the other hand, hydrogenation of triglycerides produces H2O as a by-product, leading to sulfur leaching and even shortening the lifetime of the catalyst. Considering the environmental impact of catalysts in fuel production, research on non-sulfide catalysts is attracting ever more attention [6]. Metal-based phosphide/nitride/carbide catalysts have been investigated for the hydrogenation of triglycerides. Metal phosphides exhibit excellent stability in terms of resistance to leaching and deactivation [197]. Transition metal phosphides have similar electronic structures to noble metals, but are much less expensive and show no phosphide loss [198]. Jeong et al. [199] hydrogenated palm oil over NiP/SiO2 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, and found that 10 wt% NiP/SiO2 showed more excellent stability than 1 wt% Pt/Al2O3. Due to sintering, a carbon deposit is found on Pt metal. Researchers [200] have suggested that metal phosphides have two main active sites during the hydrogenation process, namely Mδ+ and Brønsted sites; the Mδ+ sites are Lewis acidic and facilitate hydrogenation and demethylation reactions. Moreover, metal-phosphide-catalyzed hydrogenation of triglycerides is more likely to induce deoxygenation through the HDO pathway, because of the activated H2 at the Mδ+ position, and the H atom at the Brønsted PO–H position can react with the adsorbed oxygen intermediate. Metal nitrides have also been used for this purpose. Wang et al. [7] investigated the Mo2C/N-catalyzed hydrogenation of a lipid model for diesel-like liquid production, whereby nitrogen doping was found to increase dispersal molybdenum and to improve the hydrodeoxygenation activity of the catalyst. Li et al. [201] prepared a Co/N–C catalyst, which showed strong Lewis acidity and basicity due to the synergistic effects of Co and N–C. Catalytic deoxygenation processes through DCOx pathways to produce alkanes were favored. Liu et al. [202] loaded Pt on nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon (Pt/NMC), whereby nitrogen improved the dispersion and anchoring of the Pt metal, providing basic sites to adsorb fatty acids and decarboxylate them to alkanes. Thus, doped-nitride-catalyzed conversions of triglycerides to alkanes mainly proceed through DCOx pathways. Recently, metal carbides have also attracted increasing interest in the transformation of vegetable oils, due to catalytic performances akin to Pt-group metals, generating high yields of hydrocarbons [203]. Mo2C and W2C are the most commonly used metal carbide catalysts, showing excellent catalytic activity and selectivity [204,205]. Sousa et al. [206] used β-Mo2C/Al2O3 to hydrogenate sunflower oil at 360 °C and 5 MPa H2, achieving a conversion rate of up to 100%. The high catalytic activity of Mo2C can be ascribed to uniform penetration of carbon within the Mo lattice, which extends the Mo–Mo distance, increases the d-band electron density at the Fermi level of Mo, and endows the compound with platinum-like properties [207]. Basem and his colleagues [208] prepared a NiWC/Al-SBA-15 catalyst, which showed great potential for the hydrogenation of triglycerides, producing heptadecane with a conversion rate of up to 97.3%. Wang et al. loaded Mo2C and W2C onto active carbon for the hydrogenation of fatty acids for the production of diesel-like liquid fuels, and found that Mo2C showed superior catalytic activity to that of W2C [204]. A prepared Mo2C/AC catalyst was also used in the hydrogenation of soybean and rubber seed oils; conversion rates were up to 95%, and the main products were C15–C18 hydrocarbons [205]. Horáček et al. [50] compared three alumina-supported MoNx, MoCx, and MoPx catalysts for the hydrogenation of rapeseed oil, and found deoxygenation activity to decrease in the order MoCx > MoNx >> MoPx; the alumina-supported MoCx showed better deoxygenation activity, whereas the MoNx catalyst showed selectivity for hydrodeoxygenation at 350 °C and for hydrocracking at 370 °C. Phimsen et al. [209] applied NiS/NiP/NiC catalysts for the hydrogenation of spent coffee oil, and found the catalytic activities to decrease in the order NiC > NiP > NiS. They surmised that NiC more likely participated in cracking reactions to furnish more short-chain products, whereas NiS tended to yield long-carbon-chain products suitable for diesel, albeit with the lowest oil conversion rate. 3.3.2 Noble metal/non-noble metal bimetallic catalysts Noble metals, especially those of group VIII, Pt, Pd, and Ru, show outstanding activity and durability. Such noble metals, especially Pt, show an excellent dissociation ability for hydrogen, expediting the hydrodeoxygenation of triglycerides to produce biofuel. Jin with his partner [210] carried out the hydrodeoxygenation of palm oil over a Pt/N-AC catalyst under optimized conditions (listed in Table 4), whereupon the catalyst showed high conversion rates and selectivity (> 90%). Besides Pt, Pd is also a commonly used noble metal in catalysts for triglyceride hydrogenation. Indeed, Pd can activate and dissociate H2, favoring hydrogenation reactions. Xia et al. [211] prepared a Pd/NbOPO4 catalyst for the hydrogenation of palm and soybean oils under mild reaction conditions (180 °C, 3 MPa H2, 24 h), taking advantage of the combined effects of the great hydrogen activating ability of Pd and the superior Lewis acidity and unique structure of NbOPO4. Although this bimetallic system showed great catalytic activity, the high cost of the noble metal undoubtedly limits application on a large scale [189]. Thus, the development of cost-efficient catalysts continues to attract more attention. Inexpensive transition metal ions, such as Ni, Co, Cu, and Mo, have also been investigated to hydrogenate vegetable oil. The reported activity trends of such metal catalysts are in the orders: Pd > Pt > Au > Rh > Ir > Ru > Os and Ni > Co > Cu. Ni shows great catalytic activity and has become a promising candidate [33,212,213]. Kim et al. [214] carried out Ni-catalyzed conversion of soybean oil at 400 °C and 9.2 MPa H2 and achieved up to 95.0% conversion in 2 h. Compared with noble metals, transition metals only show their catalytic activity under more forcing reaction conditions, and their catalytic efficiencies are generally lower. Bimetallic hydrogenation catalysts also show good performance due to their synergistic effect. Ni-based bimetallic systems are most popular, because Ni is an inexpensive metal and performs well in hydrogenation processes. Yang et al. [215] investigated Al-MCM-41-supported Ni, W, and Ni–W catalysts for converting jatropha oil. As the result shows, the biofuel yields were about 19.3 and 12.5 wt% whlie using the monometallic Ni and W catalysts. Whereas, using the Ni–W bimetallic catalyst, the biofuel yield can increase to 63.5 wt%. Obviously, the catalytic performances of bimetallic catalysts generally exceed those of simple monometallic metal catalysts [216], especially when a transition metal is paired with a noble metal, as in Au-Ni [217], Ag-Ni [218], Pt-Ni [219], and Pt–Sn/Fe [220]. The noble metal catalytic activity can be exploited, but the overall cost of the catalyst is reduced. Chen et al. introduced metal auxiliaries (Ni, Co, Cu, Fe, Sn, Zn, La) on a Pt/SAPO-11 catalyst for the hydrodeoxygenation of castor oil, whereby mainly C8–C16 hydrocarbons (paraffin, iso-paraffins, and aromatics) were produced. Their research indicated that introducing metal auxiliaries decreased the specific surface area and the number of Brønsted acid sites of the catalyst, but increased the acidity of the Lewis sites and the dispersion of Pt metal, significantly improving the isomerization activity [220]. Lee et al. [192] prepared bimetallic PtRe loaded on USY as a catalyst; compared with the traditional single-metal Pt/USY catalyst, the resistance of PtRe/USY to CO was significantly improved, allowing it to be used over a greater number of catalytic cycles, and reducing its production cost. The preparation of low-cost precious metal-like hydrogenation catalysts is currently a hot topic in research. 3.3.3 Photocatalysts Hydrocarbons can also be obtained through photocatalytic conversion processes by using photocatalysts such as TiO2 [227,228]. However, pure TiO2 shows low photocatalytic efficiency due to rapid recombination between photogenerated holes and electrons. To overcome this problem, TiO2 can be modified with metals, such as Pb, Pt, Ag, Au, or Cu, or their oxides [229–231]. Huang et al. [232] carried out Pt/TiO2-photocatalyzed decarboxylation of fatty acids on a hydrogen-rich surface to obtain C n-1 alkanes in yields of up to 90% under mild conditions (30 °C, H2 pressure ≤ 0.2 MPa, and 365 nm light-emitting diode irradiation). Even soybean oil and tall oil fatty acids were converted in high yields of >95%. As shown in Fig. 14 , Huang et al. [232] firstly proposed photocatalytic decarboxylation of fatty acids over Pt/TiO2 under the H2 atmosphere. Firstly, bio-derived fatty acid is decarboxylated to form a long-chain radical. Under the low H2 pressure and room temperature condition, Pt nanoparticles of the Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst can activate and dissociate H2, effectively accumulating photogenerated electrons to reduce protons produced by dissociation of the fatty acid [233,234]. Hence, hydrogen dissociation and proton reduction jointly enrich the hydrogen on the Pt nanoparticles even when the reaction is conducted under low H2 pressure. Alkanes are formed because the hydrogen quickly quenches alkyl radicals before they can oligomerize. 3.3.4 Supports To improve the activity of a catalyst or to achieve a controllable reaction pathway to obtain a target product, supports have been extensively studied [190,235,236]. These have included: (i) active carbon (Fig. 15 a) [204,205,237], (ii) metal oxide supports: Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2, and TiO2 (Fig. 15 b) [49,196,235], and (iii) zeolite or molecular sieve supports: ZSM-5, MCM-41, SAPO-11, SBA-15, and Y zeolite (USY and NaY) (Fig. 15 c and d) [49,171,221,225,238,239]. Supports can significantly increase the specific surface area of a catalyst, improving its performance. A typical representative is activated carbon, which has a large specific surface area [189]. Hydrodeoxygenation mechanisms are mainly determined by the electronic properties, modulated by Brønsted acid sites and Lewis acid sites. Supports can provide these, allowing for a controllable reaction [225]. γ-Alumina (Al2O3) is the most commonly used support material, the strong Lewis acid sites that can promote catalysis and hydrolysis [240]. Srifa et al. [187] loaded Ni or Co onto γ-alumina (Al2O3) for the hydrodeoxygenation of palm oil. Ni and Co were found to increase further the acidities of the resulting catalysts, which exhibited superior activities (>90% yields) and good stabilities. ZrO2, as a reducing metal oxide, can contain a large number of oxygen vacancies, and so may trap electrons in its interior. Ni et al.82 loaded Ni onto a ZrO2 support; oxygen vacancies in ZrO2 affected the electron density of the Ni, such that the hydrogenation of triglycerides showed higher selectivity for heptadecane [196]. As inert support, SiO2 is also widely used in the hydrogenation of triglycerides. In addition to serving as conventional support, TiO2 is also a special semiconductor material, generating holes and electrons under UV light, and it can show outstanding redox performance (Section 3.3.3). Additionally, molecular sieve supports usually have large specific surface areas, which can promote the dispersion of active metal sites, and mesoporous molecular sieves are conducive to the diffusion of large molecules and promote the conversion of long-chain diesel-like hydrocarbons. Ahmadi et al. loaded CoMo onto ZSM-5, MCM-41, and SBA-15 supports for the hydrogenation of pyrolytic oil; of these, CoMo/MCM-41 gave the highest heavy oil (long-carbon-chain alkanes) yield [241]. USY zeolite with strong acidity and high hydrothermal stability has also been used as an acid catalyst [242]. As mentioned above, USY has been used as acidic support for bimetallic PtRe, and the improved hydrogenation activity of the catalyst allowed the conversion of triglycerides to prepare aviation fuel. Zeolites such as ZSM-5 and SAPO-11, with high specific surface areas and great adsorption capacities, show strong selectivity for isomeric and aromatic products, making them suitable for the conversion of triglycerides into aviation fuel (mentioned in Section 4.2) [12]. 3.3.5 Production process The typical green diesel production processes are NEXBLT and Ecofining processes (Fig. 16 ). Neste developed NExBTL process in Finland and UOP/Honeywell in the United States. Ecofinning process was jointly developed by UOP and the Eni refinery in Italy. Both can be converted natural oils and waste oils to green diesel, even can be transformed into aviation biofuel. Its raw materials with highly adaptable, such as palm oil, palm oil fatty acids, shepherd wallets, seaweed, jatropha, and animal fats. The NExBTL and Ecofining processes are based on traditional refining technology, both are two-stage processes of hydrodeoxygenation and isomerization allows seamless integration into existing purification processes, reducing equipment start-up time and reducing equipment investment and operating costs [243–245]. Neste is the leading producer of renewable diesel globally, with a production capacity of approximately 3 million tons annual [243]. Currently, NExBLT process has been applied to the steam methane reforming technology for H2 production, and then H2 can use in the hydrogenation and isomerization processes. Moreover, the gas products CO2 and H2 can further convert to methane for recycling used, reducing the cost. And due to the Neste MY Renewable Diesel™ has similar chemical consistency with fossil, it can be blend with fossil diesel without any restriction or used even at 100% concentration. Honeywell-Uop Oil Company, another renewable diesel producer, which produced with the innovative UOP Ecofining™ process. Compared with traditional diesel, Honeywell-Uop Renewable Diesel™ has a better cetane value up to 80, which translates to improve operational efficiency. The Neste MY Renewable Diesel™ can be used as a drop-in replacement in vehicles with no need for modifications. Besides this, Diamond Green Diesel, the United States company, which uses animal fat as raw material and applied Ecofining technology has achieved hydrogenated vegetable oil production with an annual production capacity of 500,000 tons. Additionally, both processes can be designed to produce aviation biofuel, Neste is partnered with Air BP to deliver aviation biofuel to customers in France and Sweden. Lufthansa and KLM use the Neste MY Renewable Jetfuel™ blended with fossil aviation fuel, continue with flights departing from Frankfurt and Schiphol. In the US and Europe, Neste's aviation biofuel annual capacity is about 100,000 tons. With the Singapore refinery expansion, Neste aviation biofuel will yield over 1 million tonnes by 2022 [246]. Honeywell Green Aviation Biofuel, made from various sustainable feedstocks, with great fuel properties meets or even exceeds the most rigorous aviation fuel standards. When blended up to 50% with petroleum-based aviation fuel, higher energy density allows aircraft to fly farther on less fuel, and performance exceeds critical aviation fuel specifications (such as flash point, freeze point, stability and heat value). Ecofining technology development has received strong support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency of American (DARPA) [247]."
6,Physicochemical properties of biofuels,
7,Physicochemical properties of biodiesel and green diesel,"4.1 Physicochemical properties of biodiesel and green diesel As shown in Table 5 , the density of biodiesel is usually higher than 0.860 kg/m3, and it can certainly meet the ASTM standard for diesel (Table 6 ). Its viscosity is 3.5–5.0 mm2/s, much lower than that of the raw material (compare the data in Tables 1 and 6). However, biodiesel consists of esters, with a high degree of oxygenation, resulting in poor heat values. As listed in Table 5, biodiesel samples have heat values lower than 38 MJ/kg. Thus, for the application of such biodiesel, it is normally blended with petroleum-based diesel, as in B2, B5, B10, B20, B30, B40, and so on, which are widely used as transportation fuels. Currently, green diesel is mainly composed by hydrocarbons, and it is primarily produced by the abovementioned pyrolysis and hydrogenation conversion methods. Its physical and chemical properties are very close to those of fossil fuels. From the data in Tables 5 and 6, green diesel has a lower density and viscosity than raw biodiesel, and because it is based on hydrocarbons, with little or no oxygen content, it has a higher heat value. Hence, green diesel has become the fastest-growing alternative biofuel."
8,Upgrading to produce high-value biofuel,"4.2 Upgrading to produce high-value biofuel Green diesel can be further upgraded to high-value biofuel by isomerization and aromatization processes, increasing aromatics and iso-hydrocarbons, thereby improving the cold-filter point [225]. Transition and noble metals are currently loaded onto activated carbon, SiO2, Al2O3, ZSM-5, ZSM-22, or SAPO-11 to synthesize highly dispersed catalysts for upgrading processes [224]. In particular, ZSM-5 and SAPO-11 are two supports that are widely used for molecular structure transformation [28,49,220,225] (Fig. 17 ). Li et al. [224] prepared a novel NiO-LiZSM-5 catalyst for the hydrogenation of waste oil to produce aviation biofuel, and its yield reached 91.7 mol%. Kim et al. [225] used a Pt/nano-beta (ZSM-5) catalyst for the hydrogenolysis of palm oil and achieved 55 wt% of aviation liquid biofuel with a freezing point of −48 °C. Besides aromatization, isomerization is an alternative pathway for upgrading liquid oil. SAPO-11 molecular sieves have a unique chemical function and structure. Their combination of unique cavity shape and weak average proton acidity on their outer surfaces endows them with excellent isomerization activity, making them prime candidates for catalysts [70,252]. Chen et al. [70] used a Pt/SAPO-11 catalyst for the hydrogenation of jatropha oil under reaction conditions of 325 °C and 3 MPa H2, and mainly obtained C17 and C18 hydrocarbons (iso-C17/18/n-C17/18 = 1.4). Other researchers have hydrogenated jatropha oil by using Ni-based bimetallic catalysts (NiMo or NiW) loaded on SAPO-11; the ratio of iso-C15-18/n-C15-18 hydrocarbons was up to 2.0, endowing the C9–C14 fraction with the desired freezing point of −55.1 °C. Moreover, approximately 8% of aromatics were produced during the hydrogenolysis process, imparting the product with great potential for aviation biofuel use [221]. Through isomerization and aromatization processes, the structures of hydrocarbons can be modified and decrease the cold-filter point of final biofuels, improving the competitiveness of biofuels and expanding their application scope, especially in cold areas."
9,Physicochemical properties of aviation biofuel fraction from high-value biofuel,"4.3 Physicochemical properties of aviation biofuel fraction from high-value biofuel Generally, aviation biofuel is separated by distillation and rectification after upgrading green diesel. Compared with diesel, aviation biofuel has stricter requirements for physical and chemical properties, due to engine characteristics and the operating environment [28,253]. Before application, biofuel must be tested to ensure that it meets all requirements, such as fluidity, volatility, corrosion performance, combustion characteristics, thermal stability, additives, and pollutants [12,254]. Aviation fuel is a multi-component fuel containing linear paraffin, cyclic paraffin, olefins, and aromatic compounds, mainly distributed around C8–C16 [11,255]. The major components, including paraffin (normal and iso-paraffins), cyclic paraffin, and olefins account for approximately 70–85%, endowing the oil with a high hydrogen-to-carbon ratio, improving its heat-to-weight ratio and ensuring cleaner combustion [28,253,256]. More specifically, paraffin, cyclic paraffin, and iso-paraffins account for around 20%, 25%, and 35–40%, respectively. Of these, iso-hydrocarbons reduce the freezing point, making aviation biofuel more suitable for flight in cold regions [257]. Another important component is the aromatic fraction, which accounts for about 5–25%. It should be noted that a higher aromatic content will result in smoke formation, leading to damage to the combustion chamber or turbine blades [258]. Some of the other properties listed in Table 6 also impose restrictions. Xu et al. [27,28,180] aromatized pyrolytic oil over ZSM-5 and further subjected the product to hydrogenation over Pt/C or Raney Ni catalysts to adjust the structure towards high-value biofuel production. Pyrolytic oil aromatized by ZSM-5 improved the aromatic hydrocarbon content, and the final hydrogenated oil could be separated into aviation biofuel and green diesel. In various physical and chemical performance tests, all values met the requirements for aviation fuel standards, especially the freezing point of −47 to −51 °C, indicating a great improvement in quality."
10,Life cycle assessment for biofuel production from triglycerides,"Life cycle assessment (LCA) was first proposed in 1970 [259] and fully developed in the early 1990s [260]. LCA is an approach to analyze the environmental impacts associated with a product or service [261], and is commonly applied as an industrial standard for climate change impact. Under climate change initiatives, low-carbon energies are emphasized and encouraged. Biomass is of more interest when carbon neutrality is presumed. Many LCA studies have been conducted on bioenergy and have indicated a low contribution to global warming [262,263]. The production of biofuels from triglyceride feedstocks has been widely evaluated for its potential to replace fossil fuels. The results from LCA of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions should be reviewed to assess the renewability and sustainability of biofuels."
11,LCA and GHG emissions analysis on biodiesel,"5.1 LCA and GHG emissions analysis on biodiesel 5.1.1 Transesterification The lifecycle GHG emissions from triglyceride-derived biodiesel obtained by transesterification cover a very broad range from 8.4 to 2793 g CO2 eq/MJ of biodiesel (Table 7 ). This broad range may be attributed to differences in feedstocks and supply chains. When waste cooking oil is used as the feedstock, the lifecycle GHG emissions are very low (8.4–24.0 g CO2 eq/MJ of biodiesel). These low emissions are mainly because such feedstocks are considered as waste and have no associated cultivation and fertilization. The GHG emissions from cultivation and fertilization usually contribute more than 50% to overall life-cycle GHG emissions [264]. When crop seeds (e.g., soybean, rapeseed) are used as feedstocks, the theoretical life-cycle GHG emissions ought to be lower than those from fossil fuels (87–98.8 g CO2/MJ [265,266]). However, a real case study in Brazil found higher life-cycle GHG emissions from rapeseed oil for biodiesel [267]. High emissions from rapeseed oil-derived biodiesel have been attributed to high emissions from feedstock production (over 78% of life-cycle emissions [268]). High production of palm oil with less fertilization ensures lower life-cycle GHG emissions from palm oil-derived biodiesel [269]. Although microalgae have a relatively high oil content, their life-cycle GHG emissions can be relatively high (up to 2.8 kg CO2 eq/MJ of biodiesel) due to the low level of production and high energy consumption in cultivation, harvesting, and drying [270]. 5.1.2 Pyrolysis LCA studies focused on triglyceride-derived biofuel obtained by pyrolysis are relatively rare. According to the pyrolysis process for lignocellulosic biomass, the process could have higher energy consumption, although the life-cycle GHG emissions are lower than those for fossil fuel (32.46–35.28 g CO2 eq/MJ of green diesel from hybrid willow, switchgrass, and miscanthus [263]). In a study of pennycress oil, which is less intensively cultivated in the agricultural sector, the life-cycle GHG emission was estimated as 30.1 g CO2 eq/MJ of biofuel [271]. The life-cycle GHG emission could be as low as 370 g CO2 eq/MJ of green diesel when microalgae are grown naturally in an open pond, whereas an intensively cultivated scenario could have emissions as high as 2.47 kg CO2 eq/MJ of biofuel [272]. If the microalgae cultivation is used to substitute traditional biological nutrient removal unit operations in a municipal wastewater treatment plant as a beneficial service, a much lower GHG emission (12.2 g CO2 eq/MJ of green diesel) is obtained [273]. 5.1.3 Hydrogenation Due to differences in conversion efficiency, hydrogenation-processed green diesel demands more feedstock and higher energy input during hydrogenation cracking, and so is usually associated with higher GHG emissions than transesterification-processed green diesel. A comparative study was conducted between hydrogenation and transesterification based on two different databases [274]. In the “Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions and Energy Use in Transportation Model (GREET)” developed by Argonne National Laboratory, hydrogenation-processed green diesel from soybean and palm oils had higher life-cycle GHG emissions (47.12 and 37.05 g CO2 eq/MJ of green diesel) than those of transesterification-processed biodiesel (34.01 and 23.45 g CO2 eq/MJ of green diesel). In the New EC database, the difference was not obvious. When waste cooking oil and algal oil were considered as feedstocks, the life-cycle GHG emissions were as high as 81.59 g [275] and 3.27 kg CO2 eq/MJ [272] of green diesel, respectively. 5.1.4 Biofuel-derived CO2 emissions All of the above-reviewed LCA studies treated biofuel-derived CO2 emissions as carbon neutral (i.e., no climate change impact) because the emissions can be offset by plant regrowth [276]. Based on this assumption, popular environmental analysis tools (e.g., SimaPro, GaBi, OpenLCA) usually fail to account for biofuel-derived CO2 emissions. However, the calculation of climate change impact of biofuel-derived CO2 emissions is not trivial. The calculation should consider the plant regrowth for compensating biofuel-derived CO2 emissions, emission from land-use practice change, and the difference in carbon sequestration [277]. Therefore, by integrating a reference scenario whereby the feedstock will be unused and left to decompose naturally, microalgal, palm, and waste oil are responsible for much lower GHG emissions than in regular LCA models. When using crop seeds as feedstocks, the GHG emissions could be higher than expected."
12,LCA and GHG emissions analysis by representative renewable biofuel production companies,"5.2 LCA and GHG emissions analysis by representative renewable biofuel production companies Some typical renewable biofuel companies also have LCA and GHG emissions analysis, such as Neste MY Renewable Diesel™. The lifecycle GHG emissions are 2.85 tCO2 e/a, which with 80% lower emission compared with the conventional diesel 13.72 tCO2 e/a. Moreover, such diesel also has 33% lower fine particulates, 30% lower hydrocarbons, 24% lower carbon monoxide, and 9% lower nitrogen oxides converted into high-quality fuel. As for Neste MY Renewable Jet Fuel™, reducing GHG emissions over 80% compared with petroleum-based fuels. Such fuel gives an immediate solution for reducing the direct carbon emissions of flying [285]. Additionally, Honeywell Green Diesel, produced by the UOP Ecofining™ process, has approximately 85% lower greenhouse gas emissions and low NOx emissions and ultra-low sulfur [286]. The UOP Renewable Jet Fuel™ reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 65–85% compared with petroleum-based fuels, when the UOP Renewable Jet Fuel blended with petroleum-based aviation fuel at the ratio of 1:1 [247]."
13,Relevant policies,"The industrialization of biofuel has hitherto been implemented to support various policies from governments and organizations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Recently, the EU has stipulated that transportation fuels used by cars, ships, and aircraft must contain a certain proportion of biofuel to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and alleviate the trend of climate warming. For example, Sweden plans to stop using fossil fuels for domestic flights by 2030, extending this to international flights by 2045 [287]. In May 2019, the United States Department of Energy (DOE) announced that it would provide more than $79 million in funding to develop bio-hydrocarbon fuel production technologies [287]. And the USA Energy Independence and Security Act set a mandatory renewable fuel standard (RFS) in 2022 that requires fuel producers to use at least 36 billion gallons of biofuel [288]. Brazil, another country in the Americas, has also promulgated a legal requirement that diesel sold on the market must be blended with 12% biodiesel, and that the blending ratio will increase every year; it should thus reach 15% by 2023 [289]. In Asia, a large amount of energy for transportation is consumed in China, and the state recently issued an incentive policy for biomass energy engineering projects and equipment manufacturing, encouraging the development and application of non-food biofuels (biodiesel, gasoline, and aviation kerosene) production technologies [287]. As a major producer and exporter of biodiesel, Indonesia is considering implementing a project involving fuel with a biodiesel content of 40% (B40) in 2021–2022. Moreover, Indonesia's National Energy Policy (KEN) aims to incorporate 30% biodiesel into public transportation nationwide by 2025 [290]. Similarly, Malaysia is another major biodiesel producer and exporter, and its biodiesel blend mandate was 10% in 2019. The Government of Malaysia (GOM) has since formulated a new five-year strategy to gradually increase the mixing ratio to 20% by 2020 [291]. In India, the “Biofuel Policy” introduced in 2018 encouraged the establishment of supply chain mechanisms to increase the country's biodiesel production [292]. As for aviation biofuel, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) decided to establish carbon-neutral growth by 2020 and to aim for a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 [225]."
14,Conclusions,"Biofuel can be produced from triglycerides through transesterification, thermal cracking, and hydrogenation conversion technologies. (i) Biodiesel produced by transesterification is commonly blended with petroleum diesel. Currently, industrial production of biofuel is mainly based on transesterification conversion, but the quality of such oil, with low density, low heat value, and poor stability, does not meet the requirements of the operation of modern transportation engines. (ii) In order to improve the properties of biofuel, green diesel, mainly composed of hydrocarbons and suitable for direct use as a transportation fuel, is produced by thermal cracking and hydrogenation conversion technologies. It is worthy of mention that the thermal cracking method has a broader feedstock range and can be used to convert raw materials with high acid value and undesirable impurities, such as waste and acidic oils. The resulting hydrocarbon-based biofuel can then be blended with petroleum diesel in any proportion. (iii) Moreover, the green diesel obtained through upgrading processes (including aromatization and isomerization) shows a low cold-filter point, improved economic value, and a further broadened scope of application. (iv) LCA analysis has indicated that microalgal, palm, and waste oils are associated with much lower GHG emissions, and so these raw materials have great potential for biofuel production. Considering the LCA and GHG emissions analysis for industrial processes, biofuels can lower GHG emissions by up to 85%. Such biofuels may be applied to provide an immediate solution for reducing direct carbon emissions. With the support of policies issued by governments and organizations, the production of biofuels from triglycerides through the development of feedstock production and advanced conversion technologies is being actively encouraged. In Europe, the United States, South Korea, Japan, China, and other countries, research is being carried out on microalgal oil cultivation and cultivation technologies. China also plans to develop woody oils, such as tung and jatropha oils, as raw materials for biofuels. Overall, the cultivation of triglyceride raw materials should be guided by the rule of “do not compete with existing food crops and land for food production”. At present, to improve biofuel production efficiency and to reduce environmental pollution, (i)the development direction of transesterification catalysts for biodiesel includes:the preparation of solid base catalysts with high stability and activity by regulation of crystalline solid phases (chemical conversion) and lipase immobilization for improved enzyme activity, thermal stability, and methanol tolerance through genetic engineering, protein modification, or directed evolution (biological conversion). (ii) Production technologies have gradually developed and have even achieved industrial production, leading to fuels with great combustion performances regarding green diesel. Representative industrial hydrogenation processes include the NExBTL process and the Ecofining process. (iii)Further studies should focus on strengthening the fundamental research on catalysts, and preparing low-cost, highly active, and stable catalysts to achieve directional deoxygenation conversion production. (iv)The new triglyceride conversion technology, photocatalytic hydrogenation conversion, which is carried out under mild reaction conditions, with low energy and hydrogen consumption, giving high conversion and selectivity, looks set to become a hot topic of research and also requires research and development effort to find new catalysts."
