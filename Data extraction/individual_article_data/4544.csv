0,Introduction,"Burns are defined as damages of the skin caused by excessive heat or caustic chemicals, as the most common causes. Burn injuries cause disruptions of the normal skin barrier and impairments of numerous host defense mechanisms that prevent infections [1]. Consequently, until full epithelialization occurs, burn patients remain vulnerable to various invasive microbial infections [2]. The wound healing process is directly affected by various local factors, oxygenation, and infection. The development of a suitable material for covering the wound and further prevent infection is a long-established requirement [3]. Researchers have been using different natural polymers, such as alginate and chitosan for the production of hydrogels. Their wide application in wound dressing fabrication is based on their similitude to the extracellular matrix (ECM), which further improves acceptance by biological systems through the inhibition of the immunological reactions frequently observed for synthetic polymers [4,5]. It is suggested by the biomaterial scientists that hydrogels are good dressing membranes for the healing of wounds and suitable applicant for the patients with burn wounds in the lowest time interval due to the justifications like; hydrogels have compatibility and structures like tissues of the body, moist and wettability in the area of wound remains maintained and the liquid and fluids lost from the body controls by hydrogels [6]. Different materials of polymeric dressing e.g. hydrogels, films, foams, alginates and hydrocolloids have their own different advantages. But, hydrogels among these are the most appropriate choice as compare to other dressing formulations due to the ability of ideal wound dressing requirements needed [6]. They show stability against extreme sharp and strong temperature fluctuations [7,8]. PVA is one of the most frequent and the oldest synthetic polymer in hydrogels due to its good biocompatibility and has been applied in several advanced biomedical applications e.g. wound dressing [9]. Chitosan a biopolymer is widely used as a backbone of hydrogels. In addition, chitosan is often used in antimicrobial hydrogels for its inherent antibacterial property. The alone use of chitosan limits the mechanical strength of the hydrogel during swelling so it suggested that polymer blending can be used to improve physicochemical properties (mechanical strength). For example, it is reported that chitosan based hydrogels cross-linked with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) showed an increased mechanical strength compared alone chitosan based system [10]. Lawsonia inermis is the species of genus Lawsonia, belongs to family Lythraceae [11,12]. It is well known that active ingredient beta-asarones present in leaf, rhizomes and roots tissue is totally responsible for all anti-microbial activities of the Lawsonia inermis [13]. The abundant free hydroxyls in Lawsonia inermis may show antimicrobial activity which is able to unite with the proteins and carbohydrates in the bacterial cell wall. They may inactivate the enzyme site [14]. Lawsone (2-hydroxy-napthoquinone) has also been reported to be an immune-stimulant [15,16]. One of the main constituents of henna is flavonoids. The flavonoids are well known for their role in wound healing. Henna leaf extracts have antimicrobial activity on the bacteria responsible for the common skin infections [17]. Suitable formulation design is necessary not only for drug delivery but also for accelerating the healing process while preventing microbial activity at the site of the injury. Several topical medications are being used in the management of wounds. Hydrogels are three-dimensional, cross-linked networks of water-soluble polymers which can be formulated in a variety of physical form. They have a highly porous structure that encapsulate drugs into the gel matrix and consequently drug release at a rate dependent on the diffusion coefficient of the drug molecule through the gel network [18,19]. Based on the above justifications the present study was designed to prepare and characterize high sheared poly(vinyl alcohol)/chitosan blended hydrogels films with Lawsonia inermis as wound dressing."

Then 5.4 ml glycerol and 1.5 g Chitosan were added subsequently. 1.2 g PEG was added to this mixture. The prepared solution was stirred at 40 °C for 12 min 15% Lawsonia inermis extract and 1.2 g of 1% (wet) glutaraldehyde solution were added with vigorous stirring for 3 min. The mixture was spread in a 5 cm diameter mold with 250–300 μm thickness of hydrogel film. The final composition of hydrogel has been presented in Table 1 .
15,Characterization of hydrogel film,
16,Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),"3.1 Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) The presence of chemical groups of hydrogel was analyzed by FT-IR spectroscopy (FT/IR-4100 type A). These specific chemical components were checked in PVA, CS, PVA/CS and extract loaded PVA/CS hydrogel films. These samples were grinded in to powder and mixed with KBr to press into disk form. FT-IR spectra in the range of 4000-400 cm−1, at room temperature and resolution of 4 cm−1 were obtained by FT-IR. Cross linking between PVA and Chitosan was monitored by FT-IR spectroscopy [24]."
17,SEM of hydrogel films,"3.2 SEM of hydrogel films The surface morphology of the films with and without drug was analyzed according to the study reported by Ribeiro et al. Using Scanning Electron Microscope (Quanta FEG 450. China), images of PVA/CS and extract loaded PVA/CS hydrogel film were obtained. Before SEM analysis, samples were gold sputter and placed in scanning electron microscope. SEM micrographs were then obtained at 30 KV and X50 [25]."
18,Swelling behavior,"3.3 Swelling behavior Hydrogel sample was cut (1cmx 1 cm) and initial weight (Wi) was calculated. This sample of hydrogel was kept in distilled water to show their swelling behavior at room temperature. Weight was calculated at regular time interval of 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 min by taking sample of hydrogel from distilled water. Final weight of hydrogel with full saturation was determined as (Wf). Calculation of swelling ratio was done by the following equation (1) [26]. (1) Swelling index = [ Wf-Wi/ Wi ]×100 Where Wi is the initial weight before swelling and Wf is the final weight after swelling."
19,pH determination,3.4 pH determination 1 g of hydrogel was taken and mixed with 25 ml of purified water. The pH of this mixture was determined by pH meter (Martini M1-150). Triplicates experiments were carried out and average values were determined [27].
20,In vitro drug release profile,"3.5 In vitro drug release profile Franz diffusion cell was used for the in vitro drug release study with cellulose acetate membrane using phosphate buffer solution of pH 7.4 and kept at temperature 37 ± 1 °C. Solution of 1 ml was withdrawn with regular interval of time of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 h and replaced with fresh dissolution medium. The sample was analyzed by HPLC (PerkinElmer Shelton, CT 06484 USA) with the following conditions, particle size 5 μm, column length is 220 × 4.6 cm, mobile phase Acetonitril/water, flow rate 1 ml/min, detection UV lamp, lambda was various with gradient system [24]."

The mixture was shaken for 2 h. It was filtered and analyzed using HPLC (PerkinElmer Shelton, CT 06484 USA) with the condition of 220×4.6 column length, acetonitrile/H2O (40/60) mobile phase and 1 ml/min flow rate [28]."
22,In vivo study,"3.7 In vivo study 3.7.1 Ethical standards All experiments were performed as per the guidelines of institutional animal ehtical committee of Gomal University, D.I.Khan, Pakistan under reference no. ERB/GU/07-2019. 3.7.2 Animals selection Rabbits were used as experimental animals for the in vivo evaluation of wound healing activity. Total 15 male New Zealand Rabbits of 4 months aged with average weight of 1–3 kg were selected from animale house, Faculty of Pharmacy, Gomal University Dera Ismail Khan. They were maintained in normal and standard laboratory conditions and fed with normal diet and water. Adequate ventilation and proper conditions of temperature and humidity were provided. 3.7.3 Wounds induction Wound is the breaking or loss of cellular or functional and anatomical continuity of living tissues. Wounds are produced by chemical, physical, microbial, immunological or thermal damage to the tissues [29]. Guidelines of Animal ethical committee were followed during experiments. Dorsal side of rabbits was shaved and sterilized with 70% ethanol. Overnight starved rabbits were anesthetized by ketamine (100 mg/kg) + xylazine (10 mg/kg) through i/m route. Melted wax at 80 °C was poured into a metal cylinder of 1 × 1 cm and kept on rabbits shaved back, waited for 8 min as the wax entirely solidified, the cylinder was gently removed. A marked distinct burn wound was produced on rabbit skin [30]. 3.7.4 Experimental design Rabbits were divided into three groups with 5 rabbits in each group. Group 1 served as test group and was treated with PVA/Chitosan hydrogel containing Lawsonia inermis extract. Group 2 served as standard group and was treated with standard wound healing agent i.e. silver sulfadiazine cream (Quench®). Group 3 was a control group and treated with blank hydrogel (PVA/Chitosan hydrogel without Lawsonia inermis leaf extract)."
23,Wound area measurement,"3.8 Wound area measurement Prior to the application of treatment, every day the changes occur in the diameter of the burn wound were measured (in mm) by digital caliper. The reduction in the wound size was calculated by the following equation (2) [31]. (2) % of wound closure = Wound area on day 0 - Wound area on day ( n ) Wound area on day 0 × 100 Where Day 0 is the initial sizes of wound before treatment and “Day n” is specific days (5th, 10th and 15th). The percentage wound contraction of each rabbit was determined and average was calculated for each group."
24,Histopathology of wounds,3.9 Histopathology of wounds The histopathological study was performed according to the previous study reported by Rukayat et al. with slight modifications [32]. The wounded area of rabbit's skin was excised on specific days and trimmed into sections. Using 10% formalin the trimmed sections were stored and then embedded with paraffin. For microscopic examination these sections of skin were stained with haemotoxylin and eosin (H&E).
25,Biochemical analysis,"3.10 Biochemical analysis Biochemical analysis was performed to check level of hydroxyproline and hexosamine in the wounded area. For this purpose hydroxyproline and hexosamine were estimated by the method used by the Woessner and Rukayat et al. Briefly, the wound tissues were dried using a vacuum drier at temperature of 125 ± 5 °C. It was then exposed to HCL (6 N) at 125 ± 5 °C for 3 h and neutralized to pH 6.8 and subjected to chloramine-T oxidation for 20 min. Ehrlich reagent was used to develop the color after addition of perchloric acid (0.04 M) solution. Using a digital photoelectric colorimeter (Wincom®, AE-11D, China), the light transmission was determined at 557 nm. The hexosamine was determined by hydrolyzing the dried wound tissues in 6 N HCL at 100 ± 5 °C for 8 h which was neutralized to pH 7 with 4 N Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and diluted with water. The diluted solution was mixed acetyl acetone and heated up to 95 ± 5 °C for 45 min. This solution was then cooled and ethanol (95%) and Ehrlich reagent were added. After thorough mixing for an hour, the absorbance was determined at 530 nm using a digital photoelectric colorimeter [32,33]."
26,Statistical analysis,"3.11 Statistical analysis Data of various measured values were collected, tabulated and analyzed by using one way ANOVA and level of significance (5%) p value (p ≤ 0.05)."
27,Results and discussion,
28,Phytochemical screening,"4.1 Phytochemical screening Lawsonia inermis leaves extract was subjected to phytochemical screening for the purpose of detection of chemical constituents which play important role in wound healing. Table 2 indicates the results of these phytochemical screening. Ethanolic extract of Lawsonia inermis leaves showed the presence of phyto-chemicals constituents including flavonoids, terpenoids, carbohydrates, alkaloids, tannins, saponins, anthraquinones, phlobatamins, and glycosides. Lawsonia inermis can be used for wound healing activity as it contains highly therapeutic and medicinal compounds which play a vital role against bacteria and promote wound tissue reconstruction. Similar test was performed by Nayak et al. and confirmed the presence of saponins, tannins, triterpenes and alkaloids [34]. Rao et al. concluded that due to the pharmacological ingredients present in Lawsonia inermis it can be used as antibacterial, antioxidant, analgesic, antifungal, antiviral, antiparasitic, antidermatophytic, and anti-infammatory [23]."
29,FTIR of hydrogel films,"4.2 FTIR of hydrogel films FTIR studies were conducted to determine the different functional groups and esterification reaction among the polymers used in the hydrogel preparation (Chitosan and PVA). It also reveals the various constituents present in the crude extract of Lawsonia inermis. Compatibility of the polymers with the crude extract loaded in the hydrogel was verified by FTIR spectra. The FTIR spectra of Lawsonia inermis (Fig. 1 ) showed the different vibrational bands which represents various pharmacologic groups. The broad band at 3375 cm−1 showed presence of hydroxyl group (OH) that indicate alcohol and phenol but here an active moiety Lawsone (2-hydroxy, 1,4-nephtaquinone) because OH is found in the aromatic ring of Lawsone. The absorption peak at 2961.02 cm−1 represents the C–H stretching which are found in alkane. Peak at 1647.22 cm−1 showed the carbonyl CO stretching which conform the quinine presence. Peak at 1398.70 cm−1 reveals C–H bending of alcohol. Absorption band at 1077.69 cm−1 indicates the C–OH stretching vibration that is assigned to primary alcohol present in the Lawsonia inermis crude ethanolic extract. These results are in agreement with Zulkifli et al., Wagini et al. and Rousta et al. [36–38]. The FTIR spectra of chitosan revealed peak at 3399 cm−1 related to N–H in NH2 of primary amines. Absorption band at 2922 cm−1 shows the C–H stretch of CH2OH group. The CO stretching of NHCOCH3 (amid I) is represented by absorption peak at 1647.3 cm−1. The spectra also showed peak at 1031.7 cm−1 indicating the presence of C–O mode that is the attachment of primary OH to the pyranose ring in the chitosan structure. Similar results were also confirmed by Wanule et al. [39]. FTIR spectra of PVA showed peak at 3365.20 cm−1 which indicates the presence of –OH stretching and intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Similarly C–H stretching of alkyl group and -C-O stretching were represented by 2943 cm−1 and 1095 cm−1 vibrational band respectively. These results were also demonstrated by El-Hefian et al. [40]. Spectrum of prepared hydrogel film in which Lawsonia inermis crude extract has been loaded was also observed and conform the presence of pharmacologic groups. All the characteristics peaks of extract were shown in the film which means that the drug is compatible with polymers. Cross linking between polymers was also checked by FTIR spectra. There was chemical cross linking between the chitosan and PVA molecules as Glutaraldehyde was used for this purpose (Fig. 2 ). Cross linking is due to covalent bond formation between amine groups of chitosan with bi functional aldehyde which has been preferred over hydroxyl group. Aldehyde react with both functional groups i.e. amine (–NH2) group of chitosan and hydroxyl (–OH) group of PVA. The spectra of prepared film showed the decrease in the vibrational band of amine (–NH2) group of chitosan from 3399 cm−1 to 3308 cm−1 due to the addition of Glutaraldehyde. As Mansur et al. investigated that simultaneous decrease in the vibrational band of amine (–NH2) and increase in the imine (–CN–) group takes place after chemical cross linking on addition of Glutaraldehyde [41]. Agnihotri et al. reported that chemical cross linking is essential for the improvement of mechanical properties of the film [42]. As chitosan shows poor mechanical strength on swelling so limits its usage for the purpose of disinfection of water, therefore need to cross link with other suitable polymer such as polyvinyl alcohol which has the properties of greater mechanical strength, hydrophilicity and proper chemical stability."
30,SEM of hydrogel film,"4.3 SEM of hydrogel film The surface morphology of Lawsonia inermis extract loaded hydrogel film was determined by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Excellent porous network structure of the hydrogel film was observed when morphological features were studied under SEM. Two SEM micrographs have been taken, one is blank hydrogel of Chitosan/PVA polymers (Fig. 3 A) and the other is loaded with crude Lawsonia inermis extract (Fig. 3b). Its porous structure indicates that hydrogel film can absorb water and exudates contents. The scanning electron microscopy result is in accordance with Yang et al. [42]. They prepared PVA/chitosan hydrogel for antibacterial and antioxidant properties. The SEM was performed and showed that hydrogel has porous structure which are interconnected like honey comb. The rough walls of the macro voids provide better water accessibility in the hydrogel amorphous region."
31,Swelling of hydrogel film,"4.4 Swelling of hydrogel film Fluid absorbing capacity of hydrogel film was determined by conversion of hydrogel to solvated state. Water was taken and stored by pores of hydrogel film or diffusion of water to the hydrogel polymeric matrix. Sample of hydrogel film (1 cm × 1 cm) was kept in distilled water at 25 °C and pH 7. The result was calculated which were 0, 200 ± 0.98%, 270 ± 1.03%, 292 ± 1.33%, 295 ± 1.42%, 296 ± 0.99% and 298 ± 1.02% respectively. Results showed rapid absorption of water content by hydrogel up to 40 min and then reached to equilibrium state in approximately 60 min. Further uptake of water by hydrogel was slowed down due to saturation of film. Overall data has been shown in Fig. 4 . Water molecule got absorb into the hydrogel film initially due to formation of hydrogen bonding between water molecule and hydrophilic group present in the polymers of hydrogel. Then more water adjusted in the region of the enclosed water to form cluster. Finally the excess molecules of water enter freely into the network of hydrogel and become more swollen. The OH groups of PVA and NH2 groups of chitosan form hydrogen bonding but excess OH groups of PVA attract more water molecules by formation of hydrogen bonding with water to swell up the hydrogel therefore the swelling ratio is increased with higher amount of PVA. Similar study was performed by Khurma et al. and concluded the same swelling mechanism [43]. It means that the prepared hydrogel film has water absorbing capacity and absorbs the exudates of burn wounds and provides environment necessary for healing of burn wounds. In order to check the stability of hydrogel film, its pH was determined at regular interval of time. The pH was calculated in triplicate and average was calculated. Average pH was 5.16 ± 0.046, 5.11 ± 0.081, 5.08 ± 0.057 and 5.01 ± 0.034 on 0, 10, 20 and 30 days respectively. pH values are shown in Table 3 . Results were analyzed by ANOVA at significance level of 0.05 which showed insignificant variation in pH at different days which conforms the stability of prepared hydrogel films. This pH of hydrogel is suitable and compatible for skin application and didn't cause irritation [31]."
32,In vitro drug release profile,"4.5 In vitro drug release profile The drug released from prepared hydrogel film has been shown in Fig. 5 . It was observed for 0 time, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 h and the results were recorded as 0, 45.8 ± 0.21%, 57.3 ± 0.37%, 65.7 ± 0.88%, 73.2 ± 0.50% and 81.5 ± 0.89% respectively. At the beginning it was observed that drug release from film was quick and then onward the released became slow with the passage of time as the medium was saturated and amount of drug in the hydrogel became lesser. Pore diffusion caused the released of drug from the film. Initially the abrupt and more release of drug from the hydrogel occur due to the high concentration of drug in the hydrogel film and quick swelling behavior as El-Kased et al. prepared topical hydrogel for wound dressing and found that initial quick release of drug is due to the high concentration of drug present in the polymeric film and abrupt swelling behavior. After some time the remaining drug release became slower due to the less concentration of drug in the film and more concentration in the medium [31]. It is also noticed that polymers of the film which are highly cross-linked release the drug slowly [44]."
33,Drug content determination,"4.6 Drug content determination The uniform distribution of the drug throughout the prepared hydrogel film was confirmed by drug content analysis. For this purpose the percent drug content was periodically determined for 30 days and it was 96.98 ± 1.1%, 96.85 ± 1.12%, 96.79 ± 0.96 and 96.72 ± 0.91% on day 0, day 10, day 20 and day 30 respectively as shown in Table 4 . This study revealed that there is insignificant statistical changes occurred during the mentioned period. The official limit of drug content is 100 ± 5% and the result of hydrogel film also within official limits."
34,In vivo study,"4.7 In vivo study 4.7.1 Wound area measurement Fig. 6 shows the overall quantitative percent wound closure in three groups while Fig. 7 shows the pictorial effect of hydrogel film in control, test and standard groups. Test group was treated with Lawsonia inermis extract loaded hydrogel film and their average wound contraction at day 5, 10 and 15 in were 63.58%, 82.69% and 96.76% respectively. Control group was treated with blank hydrogel film and their wound closure were 32.24%, 40.89% and 50.43% on day 5, 10 and 15 respectively. Standard group was treated with Quench® (silver sulphadiazine) cream and percent wound contraction were 65.31%, 84.47% and 99.54% on day 5, day 10 and day 15 respectively. After 15 days of treatment the test group showed insignificant difference (p > 0.05; ANOVA) with standard group in the wound contraction while significant difference was observed with control group as wound closure was significantly lower in the control group (p < 0.05; ANOVA). The results of the present study are in accordance with previous studies conducted by Mandawgade & Patil who found 97% healing of burn wounds in rats by ethanol extract of Henna [45]. Another study revealed 71% wound closure by ethanolic extract of Henna when compared to nitrofurazone ointment group that was 70% and untreated group that was 58% [46]. The wound healing properties of Henna is due to various constituents present in its herbal extract like flavonoids, gallic acid and terpines which promote faster wound closure [47]. Lawsone, the major component of Henna has many biological properties like antioxidant [48], analgesic, anti-inflammatory [49] and antibacterial [50]. Monoterpenoides have anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties [51,52]. The data was analyzed with ANOVA and represented as mean ± Std.D. The comparison of test group with control is indicated by ###. While ** p < 0.02 and *** p < 0.002 refers to statistical significance of test and standard group from control. 4.7.2 Histopathology of burn wounds The haemotoxylin and eosin stained burn wounds are presented in Fig. 8 . After histopathological examination it has been revealed that there is a significant difference between the test group and control group in wound healing after 15 days. The test group (Hydrogel film treated group) produced same results to the standard group. There was no noticeable difference on day 5 in the incised wounds of all the three groups. On day 10 and 15 the control group had a lower rate of wound healing as compared to the test and standard group. This difference was seen and evaluated by the angiogenesis expression, fibroblasts, macrophages and collagen formation. The macroscopic appearance also evidenced the higher wound healing in test group as compared to the control. The effect of Lawsonia inermis on wound healing in animal is also reported by the Towfik et al. [53]. Their results demonstrated that Lawsonia inermis extract is effective in wound healing and retained thick keratinization, higher proliferation and profound fibroblasts formation."
35,Biochemical study,"4.8 Biochemical study Hydroxyproline, the main constituent of collagen, is an amino acid which serves as a marker of collagen biosynthesis at the wound site. It is considered a key for collagen content and concentration of hydroxyproline is a measure of concentration of collagen. Therefore higher concentration of hydroxyproline indicates faster rate of healing wound. Collagen not only provides strength and integrity to the tissue matrix, but also plays a vital role in homeostasis and in epithelialization at the later phase of healing. Biochemical analysis showed increased hydroxyproline content, which is a reflection of increased cellular proliferation and there by increased collagen synthesis [54,55]. Similarly hexosamine which is component of glycosamineglycans helps in the stabilization of collagen fibers. Hexosamine the matrix molecule, which acts as ground substratum for the synthesis of new extracellular matrix, is increased during the wound healing. Increased hexosamine content reflects the stabilization of collagen molecules by enhancing electrostatic and ionic interactions [56–58]. The results of the biochemical analysis have been shown in Fig. 9 a and b. The test and standard group significantly enhanced the hydroxyproline content level in the wounds tissues as compared to the control group. The level of hydroxyproline in control, test and standard groups were 8 mg/g, 21 mg/g and 23 mg/g respectively. This difference indicates the faster healing of wounds in these two groups relative to the control. The hexosamine level in control, test and standard groups were 6 mg/g, 20 mg/g, and 22 mg/g respectively which suggested the improvement of stabilized collagen fibers in the wound tissues. Hence, enhanced hydroxyproline and hexosamine synthesis provides strength to repaired tissue and stimulates healing. Significant increases in hydroxyproline and hexosamine content were observed in the wounds after treatment with extract loaded hydrogel films and these findings were supported by the histopathological data."
36,Conclusion,"Based on the results of this study, a novel, non-toxic, biocompatible hydrogel dressings that consist of Chitosan/PVA along with Lawsonia inermis extract have been synthesized using high shear for initiation and crosslinking. Wound healing properties have been confirmed in vivo. Regardless of the isolation and purification of constituents, the overall effect is most likely a result of a combination of phenolic content, phytochemical composition, as well as anti-oxidant activity. Taken together our findings indicate that the Lawsonia inermis extract formulated hydrogel dressings accelerated the healing process in burn wounds. Furthermore, this study confirms Lawsonia inermis leaves as a potentially safe therapeutic strategy to accelerate wound healing. Further investigation to characterize the role of individual ingredients of the extract in burn wounds is thus suggested."
