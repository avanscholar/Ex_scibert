0,Introduction,"In recent decades, our dependence on fossil energy sources has caused serious environmental problems. The use of hydrogen as an energy carrier could contribute to sustainable energy development if renewable hydrogen production is contemplated. This is the reason why hydrogen production from biomass-derived sources has attracted much attention [1–3]. Bio-butanol can be produced from a sugary biomass by fermentation; a specific mixture (butanol/acetone/ethanol=6/3/1, mass ratio) is considered a model of the bio-butanol raw mixture obtained [4]. Oxidative steam reforming of bio-butanol is a potential strategy for hydrogen production due to the ease of bio-butanol transport, its renewable character and its high hydrogen content [5,6]. Furthermore, reformation of the preliminary liquid raw mixture (butanol/acetone/ethanol=6/3/1, mass ratio) is favourable in terms of energy, as no further distillation is necessary. Although there are few studies concerning bio-butanol reforming processes, other renewable higher alcohols, such as ethanol and glycerol have been extensively studied over supported metal catalysts, and the influence of the support on the catalytic behaviour of the samples is well recognized [2]. CeO2–ZrO2 oxides have been proposed as supports for catalytic reformation of ethanol and glycerol, because of their thermal stability and OSC [7,8]. Insertion of Zr4+ into the CeO2 structure leads to structural distortions of the ceria fluorite lattice which improve its OSC, thermal stability and resistance to sintering. Since Zr4+ is smaller than Ce4+, it can contribute to removing the strain associated with the increase of size accompanying the Ce4+ to Ce3+ transition, and therefore to enhancing the ceria redox capacity and facilitating oxygen mobility [9]. Computer simulation studies revealed that even small additions of ZrO2 greatly facilitate bulk Ce4+ reduction compared to pure CeO2 [10]. The surface basicity, OSC and metal-support interactions are characteristics of primary importance for catalysts used in reforming processes [11]. For CeO2–ZrO2 supports, both their composition and their method of preparation could determine these characteristics and consequently the catalytic behaviour of these catalysts in reforming processes. Ethanol steam reforming has been studied over different M/Ce1−x Zr x O2 catalysts. When Rh/Ce1−x Zr x O2 (x =0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8) were used as catalysts, Rh/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 showed the highest H2 and CO2 yield and the lowest deactivation rate due to the formation of carbon deposits [12]. Likewise, a study of ethanol steam reforming over Ni/Ce1−x Zr x O2 (x =0, 0.26, 0.59, 0.84, 1) revealed that Ni/Ce0.74Zr0.26O2 had the highest activity, which was related to it having the most reduced nickel available for reaction [13]. In fact, the high OSC of cubic Ce0.74Zr0.26O2 can increase the availability of surface oxygen, which can itself contribute to the WGS reaction and increase the H2 yield in reformation reactions [13]. The better catalytic performance in the auto-thermal reforming of ethanol over Ni/CeO2–ZrO2 samples than over Ni/ZrO2 has been related to the higher dispersion of nickel species and the higher OSC [7]. However, the segregation of bulk CeO2 in Ni/CeO2–ZrO2 catalysts with a support composition of Ce0.48Zr0.52O2 was related to poorer catalytic performance due to the less oxygen provided on the catalyst surface [7]. With respect to the metallic phase, the addition of a second metal to a monometallic catalyst can have several beneficial effects on the behaviour of the material in the reforming process; a review of this work was recently published [14]. We studied non-oxidative and oxidative steam reforming of the bio-butanol raw mixture over cobalt-based catalysts. The presence of small amounts of noble metals facilitated the reduction of the cobalt species thereby contributing to the enhanced performance of the catalysts [15–18]. Specifically, we have recently shown that the Rh and Ir addition to Co/ZnO catalysts decreases both the cobalt sintering and the carbon deposits under oxidative steam reforming of the bio-butanol raw mixture (OSRB) [18]. Taking into account our recent results regarding OSRB together with the background of the use of CeO2–ZrO2-supported catalysts in the reforming of higher alcohols, here we study the oxidative steam reforming of bio-butanol raw mixture (OSRB) over CoIr/Ce 0.82 Zr 0.18 O2 catalysts. The aim of this work is to establish the main parameters that influence the behaviour of CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18O2 in OSRB for H2 production. Catalysts were tested in OSRB at initial conversion values lower than 100% and this allowed to follow the deactivation. Different calcination temperatures of the support provided catalysts with a similar composition but different intrinsic characteristics which determine the catalytic behaviour. In order to establish the structure-catalytic behaviour relationship, catalysts were characterized using: temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), oxygen storage capacity (OSC), CO2 temperature programmed desorption (TPD), CO2 adsorption calorimetry, CO chemisorption followed by diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Ce0.82Zr0.18O2 supports were prepared using urea as the precipitation agent. An aqueous solution containing Ce(NO3)3.6H2O, ZrO(NO3)2.xH2O and urea was treated at 90°C under stirring for 6h. After filtration and thorough washing with water, the precipitate was dried at 70°C overnight and finally calcined at 500°C, 700°C or 900°C for 5h in air, yielding the supports Ce0.82Zr0.18500, Ce0.82Zr0.18700 and Ce0.82Zr0.18900, respectively. Catalysts, containing approximately 7% Co by weight and 0.3% Ir by weight, were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using an aqueous solution containing Co(NO3)2.6H2O and IrCl3.xH2O. The impregnated samples were dried at 70°C overnight and then calcined at 450°C in air for 5h. The catalysts were thus named: CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18500, CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18700 and CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The metal content was analyzed by inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry using ICP-OES Perkin Elmer Optima 3200RL equipment. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded at −196°C using a Micromeritics Tristar-II. Prior to the measurements, the samples were outgassed at 150°C for 2h. The specific surface area was calculated by multi-point BET analysis of the nitrogen adsorption isotherms. XRD patterns were recorded using a Siemens D-500 X-ray diffractometer with nickel-filtered CuK α1 radiation. The XRD profiles were collected between 2θ =20° and 100̊, with a step width of 0.05̊ counting 3s at each step. The mean crystallite size of the particles was calculated according to the Debye–Scherrer equation. H2-TPR, OSC and CO2-TPD experiments were performed using a Micromeritics AutoChem-II chemisorption analyser. For the H2-TPR experiments, about 40mg of each catalyst was pretreated at 100°C for 1h under flowing He. After cooling to room temperature, the sample was exposed to a flow of H2/Ar (12% vol/vol, 50mL/min), and the temperature was linearly increased at 10°C/min up to 800°C. The OSC of the catalysts was measured using the oxygen pulse injection method. Before analysis, the samples (50mg) were reduced with H2/Ar (12%, vol/vol, 50mL/min); the temperature was linearly increased at 10°C/min up to 800°C and was kept at 800°C during 5min. Then, they were cooled to 300°C under Ar flow (50mL/min). A stream of O2/He (10% vol/vol, 50mL/min) was periodically injected into the reduced sample until saturation and accordingly the consumption of oxygen was calculated. Prior to the CO2-TPD runs, the catalyst (100mg) was reduced under ﬂowing H2/Ar (12% vol/vol, 50mL/min) for 1h at 450°C and then cooled to 30°C under ﬂowing He. The adsorption of CO2 was carried out using a feed of CO2/Ar (10% vol/vol) for 1h. The reactor was then purged with He for 30min. The temperature was increased to 800°C at a rate of 10°C/min, under a He ﬂow. The CO2 adsorption was also evaluated by calorimetry. The adsorption enthalpy of CO2 was measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) using a Sensys evo DSC instrument (Setaram) equipped with a 3D thermal flow sensor. The sample was loaded into twin fixed-bed reactors, with one reactor serving as the reference. The sample was firstly reduced in H2/Ar (12% vol/vol) for 2h at 450°C and then cooled down to 30°C under Ar flow. A flowing mixture of CO2/Ar (10% vol/vol) was admitted to the catalyst at 30°C. The exothermic peak corresponding to CO2 adsorption was integrated to provide the total enthalpy of adsorption for the amount of CO2 adsorbed. The mean heat of adsorption per mole of adsorbed CO2 was determined by considering the total amount of CO2 adsorbed. XPS was performed using a VG Escalab 200R spectrometer with MgKα (hυ =1253.6eV) at a pressure of 4×10−9 mbar during data acquisition. The charging effect was corrected by referencing the binding energy of C 1s at 284.9eV and the spectra were curve-fitted using a Gaussian–Lorentzian procedure. In situ DRIFT spectroscopy of CO adsorption was recorded using a Nicolet Magna-IR 750 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled MCT detector and a Spectra Tech catalytic chamber. The spectra recorded consisted of 64 scans at 4cm−1 resolution. Prior to CO adsorption, the reduced samples were re-reduced in situ in the catalytic chamber under an H2/Ar flow (12% vol/vol) at 400°C and then cooled to room temperature under a He flow. Carbon monoxide (10% vol/vol CO/He) was brought into contact with the reduced catalysts at room temperature; the samples were outgassed with He at room temperature; and then their spectra were recorded. Raman spectra were recorded using a Jobin-Yvon Lab Ram HR 800 with a solid state laser at 532.1nm and a CCD detector. The Raman spectra of the catalysts were collected with the laser power limited to 0.7mW to minimize laser-heating effects. TEM images were obtained using a J1010 microscope. Ethanol suspensions of the samples were prepared by ultrasonic treatment and then they were deposited onto a copper grid to be studied."
4,Catalytic measurements,"2.3 Catalytic measurements Catalytic reforming tests were carried out in a Microactivity-Reference unit (PID Eng&TECH). The catalysts were mixed with inactive SiC (Prolabo, 0.5mm) and placed in a tubular fixed-bed reactor (305mm long, 9mm i.d., 316-L stainless steel) up to a catalytic volume of approximately 1mL. The temperature was measured using a thermocouple in direct contact with the catalytic bed. Before the reaction, the catalyst (300mg) was reduced under an H2/Ar mixture (H2/Ar 10% vol/vol) at 450°C for 1.5h. Two piston pumps were used to introduce bio-butanol (butanol/acetone/ethanol=6/3/1, mass ratio) and water separately, The liquid mixture was then vaporized and mixed with a controlled flow of dilution gas (Ar) and air to achieve the desired O2 concentration in the reactant flow (S/C=3; raw mixture/O2 =1/1.5; GHSV=7500h−1). The products were analyzed on-line with a Varian 450-GC equipped with a TCD detector, a methanizer and two FID detectors."
5,Results and discussion,"As stated in the Experimental section, three Ce0.82Zr0.18O2 oxides were prepared by precipitation and then calcination at 500°C, 700°C and 900°C and used as supports for CoIr catalysts with approximately 7% Co (wt/wt) and 0.3% Ir (wt/wt). Table 1 shows several characteristics of the calcined catalysts. Their BET surface areas declined with the increasing calcination temperature of the support: a decrease from 72m2/g (CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18500) to 25m2/g (CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18700) and 14m2/g (CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900). In all cases, the XRD patterns of the calcined catalysts (Fig. 1 ) exhibited diffraction peaks that were assigned to the support and to the presence of Co3O4 particles; no diffraction lines that could have been considered characteristics of Ir-containing phases were present. All the XRD patterns were dominated by the presence of peaks characteristic of CeO2 with a fluorite structure (JCPDS 00-034-0394). Moreover, the XRD patterns of CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18700 and CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900 showed a peak at 2θ =29.9° which corresponded to the more intense peak of tetragonal ZrO2 (JCPDS 01-088-1007); this indicates that the segregation of t-ZrO2 crystallites takes place at a calcination temperature of 700°C or higher. From the XRD pattern of CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18500, the formation of a Ce1−x Zr x O2 cubic solid solution is envisaged; since a slight displacement of the position of the peaks characteristic of CeO2 to higher 2θ angle values is noted ((111) diffraction peak from 28.54° in CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900 to 28.58° in CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18500). The crystallite size of CeO2 were calculated for all catalysts from the (111) peak, using the Debye–Scherrer equation. The size, which was in the range 11–36nm, increased significantly with increasing calcination temperature of the support (Table 2 ). For CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18500, in which no segregation of crystalline ZrO2 existed, the external surface obtained from XRD (77m2/g) was close to the BET surface area (72m2/g); at least in this catalyst the presence of mainly monocrystalline Ce1−x Zr x O2 grains is thus deduced. A crystallite size of 9nm and 10nm was calculated for t-ZrO2 in CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18700 and CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900, respectively; for this calculation, the (101) peak, which is the most intense of t-ZrO2, was used. The crystallite size of Co3O4 particles determined by XRD increased slightly when the calcination temperature of the support was increased from 500°C to 900°C; the crystallite size calculated from the (311) peak of the Co3O4 phase was in the 11–14nm range. This small increase in the crystallite size of Co3O4 is consistent with that which was observed in CeO2, as mentioned above (11–36nm). Fig. 2 shows the TPR profiles of the catalysts and those of the corresponding supports. Two broad peaks centered at 450–475°C and 690°C were clearly visible for Ce0.82Zr0.18500 and Ce0.82Zr0.18700 supports; the peak located at 450–475°C which intensity decreased with the increase of calcination temperature of the support, is related with the reduction of Ce4+ surface species. The TPR profiles of the three catalysts showed two main peaks of H2 consumption (peaks I and II); the minor contribution at about 700°C is related with the support reduction. The catalysts showed significant differences in both the TPR profile and the amount of H2 consumed (Table 3 ). The peak at the lower temperature (peak I) showed the maximum of H2 consumption at 144°C in the profile of CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18500 and CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18700, and at 162°C in the profile corresponding to CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900. Moreover, peak I corresponding to CoIr/CeZr500 was wider than for the other two catalysts and showed a shoulder at approximately 125°C. The amount of hydrogen consumed corresponding to peak I calculated by deconvolution appears in Table 3. As a reference, Table 3 also shows the theoretical H2 consumption necessary for the reduction of IrO2 to Ir and that necessary for the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO, which is the first step in Co3O4 reduction. In all the cases, the amount of H2 corresponding to peak I largely exceeded that required for the reduction of IrO2 to Ir; this excess of H2 is related to the reduction of Co3O4 particles in CoIr/Ce 0.82 Zr 0.18 O2 which are favoured, via hydrogen spillover, by the presence of Ir. This may be related to close contact between the cobalt and iridium species, as has already been proposed to occur in other Co-noble metal catalysts [19,20]. Moreover, a contribution to peak I of the reduction of Ce4+ species cannot be ruled out; recently the reduction of Ce4+ species at a temperature lower than 150°C was reported for Ir/CeO2 catalysts [21]. The amount of H2 consumption corresponding to the peak I exceeds by 104% (CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18500), 39% (CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18700) and 11% (CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900) that necessary to reduce IrO2 to Ir and Co3O4 to CoO. The extension of the reduction of cobalt species (and/or Ce4+ species) achieved at a low temperature (peak I) increases when the calcination temperature of the support decreases. Table 3 also compares the hydrogen consumed (peaks I and II) in the TPR experiments and the theoretical consumption of H2, assuming reduction of Co3O4 and IrO2 to Co and Ir, respectively. In all the cases, the experimental value (peaks I and II) was higher than the theoretical one and the amount of excess hydrogen consumed was in the order: CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18500 (46%)>CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18700 (29%)>CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900 (18%). Peaks II are related with the reduction of the remaining cobalt oxides and the partial reduction of Ce4+ species to Ce3+. As stated in the Introduction section, the addition of Zr4+ to ceria enhances the ceria redox capacity and facilitates bulk Ce4+ reduction [10]. Moreover, in our case, the presence of Co and Ir phases should significantly contribute to enhancing the degree of Ce4+ reduction; probably due to hydrogen spillover. The extent of the reduction of Ce4+ species was higher when the calcination temperature of the support was lower; a lower calcination temperature produces smaller crystallites of Ce1−x Zr x O2 or CeO2 and Co3O4 phases in the catalyst. Furthermore, less Ce1−x Zr x O2 may be present when the calcination temperature of the support was increased, as deduced from the XRD characterization; as stated above, the presence of Ce1−x Zr x O2 may produce an increase of the reducibility of the support with respect to CeO2. A change in the nature of the metal–support interaction and/or the number of interface sites with the change in the calcination temperature of the support is suggested [11]. The catalysts were compared in terms of their OSC because this parameter may be related to the different reducibility of catalysts and with their catalytic behaviour in the OSRB. To this end, the catalysts were reduced up to 800°C and then the uptake of O2 at 300°C was determined. To evaluate the effective amount of OSC related to the support, total values of O2 uptake were corrected according the Co and Ir redox contributions (oxidation to Co3O4 and IrO2); results are reported in Table 1. The OSC values showed a marked decrease in the O2 storage capacity when the calcination temperature of the support increased; OSC values varied from 319μmolO/gcat for CoIr/Ce 0.82 Zr 0.18 500 to 44μmolO/gcat for CoIr/Ce 0.82 Zr 0.18 900. The decrease of the OSC of the catalysts when the calcination temperature of the support increased is related to the decrease in oxygen mobility, the lower reducibility of the catalysts and probably the simultaneous decrease in the defect density in Ce1−x Zr x O2 or CeO2; using XRD, it was shown that an increase of calcination temperature produced an increase in the crystallite size of CeO2 (or Ce1−x Zr x O2) and the segregation of t-ZrO2. Although the surface area of the catalysts decreased when the calcination temperature of the support increased, it was shown previously that for Ce1−x Zr x O2 solids, OSC is directly correlated with the concentration of vacancy-interstitial oxygen defects, while the surface area exhibited much less of a correlation [22]. The XRD patterns of the reduced catalysts do not allow for identification of phases other than those corresponding to the support. After reduction, the XRD patterns did not show diffraction peaks characteristic of Co3O4 or those corresponding to reduced phases containing cobalt. It was expected that the reduction treatment would produce metallic Co particles. The most intense XRD peak corresponding to Cofcc (JCPDS 00-015-0806) is located at 2θ =44.2°; while that corresponding to Cohcp(JCPDS 01-089-4308) is at 2θ =47.4°. This latter peak would overlap with the (220) peak of cubic CeO2 (or Ce1−x Zr x O2). The low Ir content may account for the absence of peaks characteristic of Ir-containing phases. Raman spectra for the reduced catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . The band at approximately 460–465cm−1 was assigned to the F2g vibration of the fluorite-type lattice (Ce1−x Zr x O2 or CeO2). It can be viewed as a symmetric breathing mode of the oxide ions around the cerium ions [23]. The intensity and shape of the F2g band changed with the calcination temperature of the support; the intensity of the band was greater and it was located at a lower Raman shift as the calcination temperature was increased. The increase in the intensity of the F2g band is related to better crystallization of the cubic Ce1−x Zr x O2 or CeO2 when the calcination temperature was increased, in accordance with the XRD results. Although for CeO2 nanocrystals a decrease in the Raman shift of the F2g band referred to bulk CeO2 has been reported [23], the slight decrease in the Raman shift of the F2g band from CoIr/Ce 0.82 Zr 0.18 500 (465cm−1) to CoIr/Ce 0.82 Zr 0.18 900 (460cm−1) may be related to the different composition of Ce1−x Zr x O2 in the catalysts [24,25]; the XRD results showed the partial segregation of tetragonal ZrO2 in CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18700 and CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900 from the Ce1−x Zr x O2 solid solution. However, there was no evidence in any case of the formation of t-ZrO2 in the Raman spectra, since t-ZrO2 shows six active Raman bands (A1g +3Eg +2B1g) at 190cm−1, 270cm−1, 315cm−1, 455cm−1, 602cm−1 and 645cm−1 [26]. The other three bands centered at 480cm−1, 516cm−1 and 681cm−1, in the Raman spectra in Fig. 3 were attributed to surface cobalt oxides [27–29], which probably formed due to the ex-situ experimental set-up used to register the Raman spectra. The surface basicity of reduced catalysts was determined by CO2–TPD and by CO2 adsorption followed by calorimetry. Fig. 4A shows CO2–TPD profiles of the catalysts. Large differences were found between the CO2–TPD profile of CoIr/Ce 0.82 Zr 0.18 500 and those of the other two catalysts whose supports were calcined at higher temperatures (CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18700 and CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900). In the CO2–TPD profile of CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18500, three main CO2 desorption zones can be identified: the low temperature zone at 30°C–200°C (LT), the medium temperature zone at 200°C–400°C (MT), and the high temperature zone (HT) with CO2 desorption peaks at temperatures higher than 400°C. These desorption zones are related to the strength of basic sites on which CO2 is chemisorbed. The LT peaks are related to the formation of hydrogencarbonates that result from the interaction of CO2 with weak basicity hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support [30]. The MT peaks correspond to the formation of bridged and bidentate carbonates, and they are associated with the presence of M x+…O2− pairs of intermediate basic strength. The HT peaks can tentatively be assigned to the formation of relatively stable carbonates resulting from the reaction of low coordination O2− ions with CO2 [30]. The amount of desorbed CO2 from CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18700 and CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900 at MT and HT was lower than that desorbed from CoIr/CeZr500 (Fig. 4A). CO2 adsorption was also followed by calorimetry. Table 4 shows the total number of basic sites per gram of catalyst and the surface density of basic sites (number of basic sites per unit surface area) determined by this technique. Both values decreased with increasing calcination temperature of the support (from 500°C to 900°C). On CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18500, the total number of basic sites per gram of catalyst was almost ten times higher than that on CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900; and the surface density of basic sites was over twice that of CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900. The surface density of basic sites decreased almost linearly with the increase of CeO2 (or Ce1−x Zr x O2) crystallite sizes as shown in Fig. 4B. Table 4 also shows the mean heat of CO2 adsorption per gram of catalyst and per mmol of adsorbed CO2. Both these CO2 adsorption heat values decreased when the calcination temperature of the support was increased. This trend revealed that the mean basic strength per adsorption site declined with increasing support calcination temperature, in accordance with the CO2-TPD results. Besides the gradual support sintering, the increase in calcination temperature from 500°C to 700°C and 900°C produced a decrease in the total number of basic sites and the almost total disappearance of basic sites with moderate and strong strength. The reduced catalysts were also analyzed by XPS; Ce 3d, O 1s, Zr 3d, and Co 2p core level spectra were recorded for all the samples and are shown in Figs. 5A–D, respectively. Due to the overlapping of the Co 3p and Ir 4f levels, surface Ir was not determined by XPS. XPS Ce 3d profiles are usually fitted to eight components, four of them correspond to the Ce 3d5/2 level (v components) and the other four to the Ce 3d3/2 level (u components) [9]. Despite the large number of components that can be found when Ce3+ and Ce4+ are present, v′ and u′″ can be related to the presence of Ce3+ and Ce4+, respectively [9]. The XP spectra of all the catalysts showed both v′ and u′″ components, which indicates that both Ce3+ and Ce4+ are present (Fig 5A). In an attempt to estimate the abundance of Ce3+ species in the catalysts, the ratio (v′ area/total Ce 3d area) was calculated; the sequence of values of the ratio was CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18500>CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18700>CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900 which is in accordance with the trend of the degree of support reduction determined by TPR. Several differences exist in the XP spectrum of the O 1s core level (Fig. 5B) as a function of the calcination temperature of the support. Although in all cases the spectrum can be deconvoluted into two components, the catalysts differ in the relative abundance of the components and in the corresponding binding energy (BE) value. The O 1s component at a higher BE has been associated with the presence of surface OH related to adsorbed oxygen [31]. The contribution of this component to the total O 1s spectrum was: 15%, 7% and 6% for CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18500, CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18700 and CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900, respectively (Fig. 5B). The slightly higher O 1s BE value for CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18500 than those corresponding to CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18700 and CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900 (see Fig. 5B), would be related to the enrichment of Zr4+ in the CeO2 cubic lattice in the first compared to the other two [9]. The Zr 3d spectra also showed differences between the catalysts (Fig. 5C); the shift toward higher BE values of Zr 3d corresponding to CoIr/Ce 0.82 Zr 0.18 500 with respect to those of CoIr/Ce 0.82 Zr 0.18 700 and CoIr/Ce 0.82 Zr 0.18 900 would also pointed the enrichment of Zr4+ in the CeO2 cubic lattice in CoIr/CeZr500 [9]. All these data are in accordance with the XRD data shown before, which indicate the tetragonal ZrO2 segregation in CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18700 and CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900 and the formation of a Ce1−x Zr x O2 cubic phase based on CeO2 in CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18500. The Co 2p spectra of the catalysts appear in Fig. 5D. The bands with maxima at 780–781eV and 795–796eV correspond to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively; the width of the bands indicates the coexistence of both Co0 and oxidized cobalt species on the surface, while the latter were probably formed by oxidation of Co0 due to air contact before the XP spectra were registered. The band centered at 787.4eV which is a satellite peak characteristic of the Co2+ presence, is more intense in the CoIr/Ce 0.82 Zr 0.18 500 spectrum than in those of CoIr/Ce 0.82 Zr 0.18 700 and CoIr/Ce 0.82 Zr 0.18 900. In Table 5 , the surface Co/Ce+Zr and Ce/Zr atomic ratios of the reduced catalysts as determined by XPS are compared with those determined by chemical analysis. As shown in Table 5, for all the catalysts, the Co/(Ce+Zr)XPS values were higher than the ratios determined by chemical analysis. Moreover, Co/(Ce+Zr)XPS decreased with increasing calcination temperature of the support. In contrast, Ce/ZrXPS was slightly higher than Ce/ZrCA for CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18500 and CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18700 but lower for CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900; this may be related to the gradual segregation of t-ZrO2 as the calcination temperature of the support was increased. The reduced catalysts were also characterized by DRIFT using CO as the probe molecule; this method is said to be very useful for determining the characteristics of the surface metallic centers of bimetallic Co-based catalysts containing noble metals [16,18]. Fig. 6 shows the spectra corresponding to CO adsorption over the catalysts. The intensity of the υ(CO) bands followed the trend: CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18500>CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18700>CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900. Although it is difficult to extract quantitative information from DRIFT experiments, comparison of the intensity of the spectra in Fig. 6 indicates that the number of surface metallic centers on CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18500 is much higher than that on CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18700 and CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900; which is in accordance with the XPS results. After CO adsorption over CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18500, three main absorptions in the υ(CO) zones 2100–2000cm−1, 1950–1910cm−1 and 1900–1800cm−1 were observed; no bands above 2100cm−1 which could be related with the presence of oxidized cobalt species were found. The most intense absorption can be deconvoluted into two bands with maxima at 2058 and 2032cm−1. The band at 2058cm−1 can reasonably be assigned to CO adsorbed on Co, which interacts with a neighbouring cobalt atom producing a tilt of the CO group; but a contribution to this band of CO adsorbed on Ir cannot be ruled out [16]. Although the band at 2032cm−1 can be related to the presence of linear CO perpendicularly adsorbed to Co0, a contribution to this band of CO adsorbed to Ir atoms in small clusters interacting with the support cannot be ruled out [16]. The bands in the 1950–1800cm−1 region are usually assigned to bridge CO [32]. However, the simultaneous presence of bands at 1930, 1857–1880 and 2032cm−1 may also indicate the presence of [Co(CO)4]− species formed by disproportionation of cobalt carbonyl species coming from the adsorption of CO on very small cobalt entities [33]. Fig. 7 presents the OSRB behaviour of the catalysts at 500°C over a period of approximately 100h on-stream. The initial raw mixture conversion followed the trend: CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18500 (95%)>CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18700(90%)>CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900(70%). As mentioned above, a similar trend for the density of basic sites determined by CO2 adsorption and for the ratio (Co/Ce+Zr)XPS was found; the number of metal-support interfacial sites should change similarly. Although there are no mechanistic studies of OSRB, studies of oxidative steam reforming of ethanol over Ir/CeO2 catalysts indicate the participation of several active sites: ceria surface oxygen vacancies associated with basic hydroxyl groups; metal-support interfacial sites; and Ir surface atoms [11]. In our case, the most sintered catalyst, CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900, showed the poorest catalytic performance; probably due to the highest sintering of the metallic phase, and the lowest basicity and redox capacity of the support. Fig. 7 also shows the evolution of the concentration of the main products in the outlet gas, for all the catalysts. Although in all cases acetone was virtually the only reactant present in the outlet gas, from this work it was not possible to discern whether the acetone in the outlet gas was unconverted reactant or formed by ethanol dehydrogenation and then aldol condensation [34]. The distribution of products was quite stable for CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18500; this catalyst showed the highest H2 concentration in the outlet gas (approximately 70mol%). In contrast, CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900 showed a considerable change in the composition of the outlet gas over time: the H2 concentration decreased greatly (from 63mol% to 34mol%) and that of undesirable C2–C4 by-products (mainly ethylene and butanal) increased through time; while raw mixture conversion decreased sharply from 70% to 20%. After 100h of reaction, catalyst deactivation followed the order: CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900 (68%)>CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18700 (20%)>CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18500 (16%). Carbon formation and the sintering of metal particles have been recognized as major causes of catalyst deactivation in alcohol reforming processes. Moreover, both parameters are strongly influenced by the nature of the support [11,35]. The post-reaction catalysts were characterized by TEM, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy. The XRD patterns of the post-reaction catalysts were similar to those of the reduced catalysts and contained only peaks characteristic of the support. In all cases, the estimated CeO2 crystallite size of the post-reaction catalysts was only slightly higher than that of the calcined catalyst (Table 2). The carbonaceous deposits generated during the catalytic tests were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, as this technique allows their degree order to be estimated [36,37]. Fig. 8 shows the Raman spectra of catalysts in the 1000–1800cm−1 zone. In all cases, two characteristic bands centered at approximately 1340cm−1 (D band) and 1590–1600cm−1 appeared. The D band is characteristic of poorly structured carbonaceous deposits; while the band centred at 1590–1600cm−1 can be deconvoluted into two components: the component at 1575–1600cm−1 is assigned to the in-plane sp2 C–C stretching vibrations of well-structured carbon deposits (G’ component) and the component at the higher Raman shift (1600–1620cm−1, D’ component) is associated with less ordered deposits [36,37]. The intensity of the bands which can be related to the amount of carbonaceous deposits formed, followed the trend: CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900>CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18700>CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18500. A similar trend was found for the I G/I D ratio: CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900, I G/I D =0.61>CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18700, I G/I D =0.54>CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18500, I G/I D =0.50. A higher I G/I D ratio is related to the presence of more ordered carbon deposits. From the spectra in Fig. 8, the position of the G band (P G) was also determined. This has also been related to the degree of graphitization of carbonaceous deposits: a higher P G is related to greater order. P G values were: 1588cm−1 for CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900 and CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18700 and 1584cm−1 for CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18500 [36,37]. The TEM images of post-reaction catalysts (Fig. 9 ) also showed abundant carbon deposits over CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18700 and CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900. From the results mentioned above, it was deduced that a higher calcination temperature of the support led to the formation of a more carbon deposits showing a higher degree of graphitization. Coke deposited on the metal surface during OSRB could partially be oxidized to CO x by the oxide ions or hydroxyl groups coming from the support; and then the oxide or hydroxyl species on the surface would be recovered from O2 or H2O reactants. This process would result in a continuous coke-removal mechanism [38]. As stated above, in this work the calcination temperature of the support influenced the OSC of the catalyst; catalysts with lower OSC showed a lower capacity to activate water/oxygen [39]."
6,Conclusions,"The catalytic performance for OSRB of CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18O2 catalysts depends on the characteristics of the support, which are determined by the calcination temperature of the CeZrO2. An increase in the calcination temperature of the Ce0.82Zr0.18O2 from 500°C to 700°C and 900°C produced catalysts with a gradual increase in the crystallite size of the support, and a gradual lowering of both the degree of reduction of the support and the OSC. Moreover, the total number of basic sites decreased with the increase in the calcination temperature of the support from 500°C to 700°C and 900°C. A calcination temperature of 700°C or higher, produced the almost total disappearance of basic sites with moderate and strong strength. CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18500 showed the best catalytic performance in OSRB and it also showed the highest stability over time. CoIr/Ce0.82Zr0.18900 showed the highest deactivation over time and the greatest carbonaceous deposits; on this support, the water and/or oxygen activation at the metal-support interface which is necessary for carbon removal is not believed to be very efficient. However, the density of the structural defects in Ce0.82Zr0.18500, its OSC and its basicity characteristics are proposed to favour both oxygen diffusion from bulk to surface and the surface transfer of OH groups. These properties contribute to the oxidation of carbon deposits and maintain the catalyst stability."
