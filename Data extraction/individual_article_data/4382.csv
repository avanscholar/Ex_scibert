0,Introduction,"China has the world's largest shale gas reserves estimated at ~134 trillion m3 (EIA, 2013). There are 13 prioritized provinces for shale gas exploitation to satisfy growing energy demands (Qiu, 2011). Shale gas reservoirs are characteristically ultra-low porosity and permeability formations (Loucks et al., 2009), and their successful exploitation has relied on a combination of horizontal drilling, multi-stage hydraulic fracturing completions, innovative fracturing, and other stimulation methods. (Warpinski et al., 2009). Due to complex geological conditions and current hydraulic fracturing techniques, the demand for fracturing fluid, which contains over 90% freshwater, ranges from 10–24 × 103 m3 per well (Wang et al., 2013a, b). Unfortunately, a large volume of the fracturing fluid (over 70%) is still retained in the subsurface after flowback operation by the positive pressure differential and spontaneous imbibition during hydraulic fracturing due to a subcritical water saturation and high capillary pressure in the shale (Makhanov et al., 2014; Ghanbari and Dehghanpour, 2015). Interestingly, an abnormal phenomenon has occurred in some shale gas wells from the Horn River basin in Canada where low (or high) flowback efficiency corresponds to a high (or low) early gas production (Ghanbari and Dehghanpour, 2016). Some previous publications insist that this may be caused by a beneficial effect of fracturing fluid retention during shut-in on gas transport, especially such as microfracture creation and propagation improving the gas transport capacity due to water-rock interaction (Roychaudhuri et al., 2011; Dehghanpour et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2015; Xue et al., 2018). Clay hydration in shale inducing hydration forces is regarded as a primary mechanism of microfracture generation (Kang et al., 2017; Qian et al., 2017), and anisotropic stress conditions compared with isotropic stress conditions can play a more positive role in inducing microfractures with the help of hydration (Liu and Sheng, 2019). However, both in the Eagle Ford Shale and the Mancos Shale from the United States, a high confining pressure usually results in a decrease in fracture width and even eventually closure, and the closure of the fractures is more severe with increased content of swelling clays (Zhang and Sheng, 2017). The generation of water-induced microfractures based on the mechanical mechanism under the formation conditions has therefore always been a controversial topic. The fracture network created by hydraulic fracture consists of propped fractures and unpropped fractures, and the reduction of unpropped fracture aperture with production time typically results in a decline in gas production (Deng et al., 2013; Wu and Sharma, 2017). Therefore, the phenomenon occurring may be caused by the large volume of fracturing fluids retained contributing to maintaining unpropped fractures open therefore promoting high early gas production (Ehlig-Economides and Economides, 2011). This indicates that methods need to be developed to maintain open apertures under formation conditions during the production to enhance shale gas recovery. Recent studies have focused on chemical-mechanical coupled action stimulation on shale reservoirs. For calcite-rich shale samples, diluted acid has a significant effect on improving matrix permeability, but causes a reduction in the effective permeability for unpropped fractures due to the decrease of fracture roughness and fracture width at formation conditions (Pournik and Tripathi, 2014; Teklu et al., 2019). Of course, some shale microfractures' conductivity can be maintained or improved under closure stress because of non-uniform etching of the “fracture faces” (Wu and Sharma, 2017), or results from a change in shale's porosity due to carbonates dissolution or development of cracks (Harris, 2017). Unfortunately, the dilute acid imbibed into the clay-rich or calcite-poor shale may also impair matrix permeability (Teklu et al., 2017&2019). Organic-rich shale commonly is rich in clay but has a low calcite content, thus dilute acid may not work well on improving porosity and permeability in these systems. You et al. (2017) proposed that an oxidative burst in organic-rich shale reservoirs by oxidative fluids can have a significant effect in enhancing shale gas recovery. Oxidative dissolution of organic-rich shale components like organic matter (OM), pyrite and carbonate minerals, such as calcite and dolomite, can generate considerable dissolution pores and induced microfractures (Li et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2018; Mahoney et al., 2019). This also influences water imbibition behaviors due to a change in the imbibition path, correlating to an enhancement of shale porosity and permeability (You et al., 2018). Furthermore, oxidative dissolution of ductile and elastomeric OM may play an essential role in minimizing proppant embedment and improving fracture face conductivity (permeability) in maintaining long-term well productivity (Hull et al., 2019). However, previous studies did not take the influence of temperature and concentration of oxidative fluids on the oxidative dissolution into account, and the reaction kinetics between the organic-rich shale and oxidative fluid, which can characterize the process resulting in induced-pores and microfractures, have not been entirely determined. Moreover, the impact of oxidative dissolution on the conductivity of unpropped fracture of organic-rich shale is not clear. In this study, the Longmaxi (LMX) organic-rich shale from the Sichuan Basin was used to determine changes in the reaction rate, fracture width, and stress sensitivity of fracture permeability using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The mass concentration of H2O2 and experimental temperatures were varied to determine reaction rates at various conditions. These results are then applied to characterize the chemical reaction kinetic behaviors of shale oxidation and to reveal the effect on improving unpropped fracture conductivity in organic-rich shale using H2O2. Finally, we also discussed the implication of organic-rich shale oxidation for developing higher performance fracturing fluid, optimizing the conductivity of unpropped fracture network created by hydraulic fracturing, and enhancing shale gas recovery."
1,Material and methods,
2,Fluids,"2.1 Fluids Previous publications have shown that H2O2 can adequately cause the oxidative dissolution of organic-rich shale (Li et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2017; You et al., 2018), and is a low priced oxidizer with no potential hazardous effect to the environment because its decomposition products are water and oxygen. Thus, H2O2 was used in this paper to investigate the kinetic behaviors of organic-rich shale oxidation and associated engineering responses. Five concentrations of H2O2 (2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, and 10% by weight respectively; Error of mass concentration is less than± 0.1) were prepared by adding deionized water (DI water) into 30% by weight H2O2. H2O2 mass concentration values were determined by PAL-39 S hydrogen peroxide concentration meter (HPCM) at atmosphere temperature (25 °C). DI water (H2O) was used as a blank reference in the experiments."
3,Shale samples,"2.2 Shale samples Shale samples were selected from a fresh outcrop block of the LMX shale formation in the Sichuan Basin, China (Fig. 1 ). The LMX shale is widespread across the Sichuan Basin and the adjacent fold-thrust belts and is regarded as the most important marine shale gas play in south China (Zou et al., 2015). To date, more than 400 wells have been drilled and completed in the LMX, of which over 150 wells have obtained high early production. The Weiyuan, Changning, Fushun-Yongchuan, and Fuling shale gas areas in the Sichuan Basin have shown substantial commercial potential for shale gas production in the LMX (Feng et al., 2018). The primary oxidizing components in shales are pyrite and OM. Mineral compositions of the shale samples were previously reported (Chen et al., 2017; You et al., 2018). The average content of pyrite of this shale is 2.6% (Cheng et al., 2017). Total organic carbon (TOC) of this shale ranges from 2.1%–4.5% (Kang et al., 2016). The distribution of pyrite and OM of using argon-ion polished shale samples were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), as shown in Fig. 2 . In this experimental study, three types of shale samples including a plug sample, sliced sample, and crushed sample, were prepared as shown in Fig. 1. First, shale plugs were drilled from a large shale block parallel to the lamination with a diameter of 2.50 cm. Some of the plug samples were further sliced into specimens with a thickness of 4.0–5.0 mm, and their surfaces were polished with 600 mesh metallographic sandpaper. Finally, at least 10 g of core fragments (380–830 μm) were collected during this process. To facilitate the subsequent testing, the core fragments were further crushed and passed through a 200 mesh sieve (i.e., particle size is less than 75 μm)."
4,Experimental studies,"2.3 Experimental studies 2.3.1 Measurement and characterization of OM in shale before and after oxidation The crushed shale samples were divided into four groups, and the sample weight of each group was 2.0 g. In order to distinguish the effect of DI water and of oxidation due to a fact that 10% by weight H2O2 consists of water and oxidant agent as stated in previous section, the first two groups were exposed to DI water as a blank contrast, and the other two groups were exposed to 10% by weight H2O2. They were all conducted for 72 h under room temperature conditions in an open system (solid-to-fluid ratio 1:20 g/mL). Solid-liquid separation of each group was performed using filter paper at the end of the experiments. TOC in the filtrates were tested using SHIMADZU TOC-LCP SSM-5000AH total organic carbon analyzer. Meanwhile, the crushed samples were dried under 60 °C for 48 h prior to quantifying chemical elements percentage and oxygen functional groups of OM using AXIS Ultra DLD X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Besides, Rock-Eval pyrolysis was then performed on the crushed samples using a YQ-VI oil and gas display evaluation instrument. The specific analysis process is shown in Fig. 3 . 2.3.2 Method for determination of mass concentration of H2O2 during the reaction Characterizing the change in molar concentration of a solution in the process of the reaction is necessary to explore kinetic behaviors of chemical reaction (Kang et al., 2016). To calculate the molar concentration of H2O2 during the reaction, the mass concentration and associated density at some time are necessary to be obtained according to Eq. (1). Unfortunately, solid-phase products formed as the oxidation reaction goes on, can lead to a failure to directly test the mass concentration, because HPCM does not work well for impure H2O2 accordfing to how it works. However, these products have a relatively low influence on the redox potential (Eh) of H2O2, and Eh can be directly and timely measured by a Thermo Scientific Orion Star A-series oxidation-reduction potentiometer (ORP). To indirectly calculate the mass concentration, the functional relationship between Eh and mass concentration of H2O2 was investigated. For reasons of experimental safety and requirements, 100 ml 12% H2O2 by weight was first prepared using HPCM and contained in a 200 ml beaker. Meanwhile, its Eh was tested three times using ORP to obtain the average value. Next, 12% H2O2 by weight was diluted gradually to a more and more low concentration by adding DI water many times. The more times DI water is added, the less amount of DI water is added in each time, and the more data points are obtained. After each addition, it was stirred well and removed the excess liquid to keep the volume of the liquid at 100 ml prior to measuring the mass concentration and associated Eh. In this process, different mass concentration range from 12% to 0.1% but the same volume of H2O2 were prepared, and the associated Eh were determined. All the measurements were conducted at room temperature in an open system. 2.3.3 Reaction kinetic experiments Sliced samples were used to determine the kinetic parameters of shale and H2O2 reaction. First, the sliced samples were dried at 60 °C for 48 h before measurement of the mass, and observation of the sample surface using a camera was conducted. Second, the samples were placed in heat-resistant plastic bottles filled full with ~350 ml H2O2, which ensures that the amount of oxidative fluid is sufficient. Third, to maintain a stable temperature in these plastic bottles, they were submerged 1 cm below the liquid level in a thermostatic water container (Fig. 4 ). Finally, once each set of experiments is completed according to the designed time, the shale samples were taken out of the fluids and washed with DI water, and then the first step was repeated. The concentration of residual H2O2 was tested once the fluid temperature in the bottles was close to the indoor temperature (25 °C). Table 1 shows the specific plan of the experiments. It's necessary to note that each sliced sample is only used for an experiment at conditions of a designed temperature (range 40–80 °C), a mass concentration of H2O2 (range 2–10%), and a reaction time (6–72 h). All the sliced samples after the reaction will not be repeatedly exposed in the fluid of another reaction. For example, when reaction time is 72 h and temperature is 80 °C, five sliced samples were used in the reaction, corresponding to different mass concentrations (2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, and 10%). The same goes for 40 °C 50 °C, 60 °C and 70 °C. Eh value of those oxidative fluids with the reaction running were measured at 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 60 h, and 72 h. Especially, in order to determine the mass loss of sliced samples in different reaction times at the same mass concentration at the temperature of 40 °C, there were six sliced samples used in the reaction corresponding to different reaction times (6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, and 72 h) in each mass concentrations (2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, and 10%). The specific experimental values of temperature, concentration, and reaction time are shown in Table 1. 2.3.4 Evaluation of stress sensitivity of unpropped fracture To reduce the influence of differences between samples on the analysis of experiment results, the long shale plugs without visible microfractures, as shown in Fig. 1, were cut into four short plugs. Besides, a single fracture was artificially created along with the lamination and the axial direction of each short plugs (Fig. 5 a), in which the fracture ran through the plug and bisected it by using a self-build device for making fractures in a core, according to the method of Wang et al. (2015). Nitrogen was used to remove the rock particles of the fracture surface before that the two parts are held together with transparent tape (Fig. 5b). The artificial fracture may play a dominant role in determining the permeability of shale plugs due to the tight matrix. Therefore, the average fracture width of shale plugs can be calculated according to the Poiseuille formula that points out the permeability of fracture is a function of fracture width. The specific information of the short plugs is shown in Table 2 . To reveal the effect of oxidative dissolution with H2O2 on the stress sensitivity of unpropped fracture, four shale short plugs were divided into two groups according to the average fracture width. For example, sample LY-1 and LY-3 are close in the average fracture width, so that sample LY-1 was exposed to DI water as a blank contrast and sample LY-3 was exposed to 10% H2O2 by weight (solid-to-fluid ratio 1:20, g/mL). Similarly, for sample LY-2 and LY-4, the former was exposed to DI water and the latter was exposed to 10% H2O2 by weight. Both were treated for 72 h at room temperature in the atmosphere as shown in (Fig. 5b). After that, all the plugs were taken out and dried under 60 °C for 48 h prior to the evaluation of the stress sensitivity. Permeability measurements of the shale plugs were performed using the CMS-300 core-automatic determination instrument during the loading or unloading of net confining pressures (3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 25 MPa), which is equal to the difference between pore pressure and confining pressure. The net confining pressures thus can be increased or decreased by gradually increasing and decreasing the confining pressure while keeping the pore pressure unchanged. After each of the stress states is maintained for a while (30 min in this study), measurement of the permeability was repeated three times to obtain their average value. Then, the relationship between net confining pressures and permeability was obtained. The stress sensitivity coefficient (Ss) for the fractured plugs can be calculated using the experimental data according to the method of Xiao et al. (2016). Finally, the fracture surface of all the plugs was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Quanta 450)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Kinetic behaviors of oxidative dissolution of organic-rich shale,"3.1 Kinetic behaviors of oxidative dissolution of organic-rich shale Previous studies have determined the change in shale components such as OM, pyrite, dolomite, and calcite, and other minerals in H2O2 (Chen et al., 2017; You et al., 2018). In this study, the dissolution mechanism of OM in shale is explored further, and the influence of H2O2 concentration and temperature on the reaction rate are quantified. 3.1.1 Mechanism of oxidative dissolution of OM H2O2 directly oxidizes the OM in a peroxidic-type reaction by a two-electron process without oxygen generation, which is regarded as a simple case (Schumb et al., 1955). Another relatively complex reaction is the reaction of OM with hydroxyl radicals (OH+), which is the main oxidative reactant in H2O2 oxidation (Levitt, 1955). During the reaction between the crushed organic-rich shale sample (380–830 μm) and 15% by weight H2O2 (solid-to-fluid ratio 1:20 g/mL) the pH of the fluid is always less 7.0 (Chen et al., 2017), and reaction 1 can be used to determine the generation of OH+ under acidic conditions due to a fact that H2O2 is protonated (Xiang and Lee, 2000). H 2 O 2 + H + ⇔ H 2 + OOH ⇔ H 2 O + OH + By measuring TOC in the crushed shale sample before and after oxidation, the OM removal rate of the LMX shale outcrop in this study treated H2O2 for 240 h is up to 87.5%, in which the mass concentration range is always controlled in 10–15% by weight during the oxidation treatment. (Chen et al., 2017). Correspondingly, in this study, TOC concentration in H2O2 after the reaction average is 91.36 mg/L, which is almost three times as much as that of the DI water (30.88 mg/L). Overall, the OM consists of two parts: the solid organic matter (SOM, or so-called kerogen) which can be removed by H2O2, and the extractable organic matter (EOM, or so-called bitumen) which is easy to be dissolved by organic solvents such as chloroform (Solum et al., 2013; Li et al., 2016). Interestingly, Table 3 lists the results of the Rock-Eval pyrolysis for the crushed shale samples after the treatment with DI water or H2O2, in which S1 and S2 correspond to EOM and SOM, and indicates that after the treatment for 72 h, H2O2 not only can remove 56.87% SOM but can also remove 55.34% EOM. To analyze the change in the OM chemical components due to oxidation, we used the Gaussian-Lorentzian peaks to de-convolute the high-resolution XPS spectra of O1s and C1s for the crushed shale samples treated with DI water or H2O2. The results indicate a significant reduction in the proportion of carbon observed by the change in the spectra area of C1s in Fig. 6 a, while a shift to the right of spectra of O1s, as shown in Fig. 6b. The C1s and O1s spectra of the samples oxidation were further quantified using the XPS peak fit analysis technology, as shown in Fig. 7 . By observing Fig. 7a and b, both of the samples had three different peaks at binding energies of 284.6 eV, 285.7 eV, and 287eV, representing the following groups in turn: C–C or C–H, C–O (alcohol, phenol or ether), and CO (carbonyl). Moreover, a new peak occurs at binding energies of 288.5 eV (representing COOH (carboxyl)) after treatment with H2O2. (Gong et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2013a, b). Interestingly, the decrease from 26.32% to 15.52% of C–O accompanies an increase from 5.53% to 10.38% of CO. The O1s spectra of the samples were also further quantified as shown in Fig. 7c and d, in which peaks at binding energies of 531.2 eV, 531.9 eV, 532.8 eV, and 533.4 eV represent COOH/C(O)O, CO, C–O and –OH related groups, respectively (Arrigo et al., 2010). With the disappearance of C–OH and C–O due to oxidation, a significant increase from 30.08% to 92.70% of CO and a slight increment from 5.08% to 7.30% of COOH can be observed. During black shale weathering, aromatic and/or branched aliphatic kerogens accumulate carbonyl oxidation products and preferentially lose aliphatic relative to aromatic carbon (Petsch et al., 2001). Similarly, H2O2 breaks the weak covalent bonds and simultaneously converts oxygen-containing functional groups on the condensed aromatics to more hydrophilic molecules (Liu et al., 2013), in which the partly aromatic ring appended by containing O/N/S groups, such as benzofuran, indol, benzothiophene, phenol, and anisole, can be over oxidized into small-molecule fatty acids (Zhang et al., 2016). Thus results the decrease in carbon in a shale sample after oxidation while the increase in TOC in the filtrates can be explained with the proposed type I (aliphatic ester), II (phenoxy) and III (ethers) of OM oxidative dissolution in Fig. 8 . Moreover, several covalent bonds are introduced into the oxygen functional groups, such as Type IV (alcohols) and V (phenolic) (Mae et al., 1997). Unfortunately, these products generated by the process of type II & III may further experience other processes such as type IV &V, which is regarded as one of the reasons that the increase of CO accompanies the reduction of the C–O. So-called oxidative dissolution is defined as when the oxidizing agent breaks several covalent bonds within the OM and then persistently transforms macromolecular compounds into small molecular compounds, especially the aromatic/branched alkyl fragments which are attached to the kerogen macromolecule and then cleaved (Petsch et al., 2001). Besides, the kerogen generated by sediment diagenesis can form asphaltene by the cracking and solid bitumen by the degradation (Tissot and Welte, 1984; Curiale, 1986). In the process of the evolution of kerogen → asphaltene → solid bitumen, all three of them called geomacromolecules can adsorb and even occlude other organic compounds defined as free molecules, presenting as noncovalently bonded moieties inside the geomacromolecular structure (Zhao et al., 2012; Liao et al., 2009).Interestingly, some of the adsorbed or occluded hydrocarbons in geomacromolecules can be released with mild oxidation treatment. Moreover, stronger oxidative degradation of geomacromolecules, such as treatment with H2O2, can realize reliable isolation of some more occluded compounds like series of 3-ethylalkanes from the asphaltenes (Cheng et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2010). These compounds released due to oxidation results in decrease of TOC in shale, which is regarded as a part of oxidative dissolution of organic-rich shale in this study. 3.1.2 Functional relationship between molar concentration of H2O2 and associated Eh Based on the experimental results, Eh of H2O2 increase with the mass concentration is shown in Fig. 9 a, in which the functional relationship between them can be reflected as an exponential function described as Eq. (2). Meanwhile, the change in density of H2O2 with the mass concentration is shown in Fig. 9b. Note that these data are obtained from the authority websites (Fig. 9b). There are two reasons for the use of the data from the Internet than the experiment data by ourselves. First, the data from the authority websites have been accepted as highly credible. After all, the density of different mass concentrate (0–30%) of H2O2 at room temperature has (25 °C) been publicly known. Second, some measurement errors may be introduced repeatedly during we measure the density of different mass concentrations of H2O2, influencing the processing of subsequent experimental data. Similarly, the change in density of H2O2 with the mass concentration was determined by Eq. (3). When Eq. (2) and Eq. (3) are substituted into Eq. (1), the molar concentration was then calculated using Eq. (4). As a consequence, the molar concentration can be obtained by testing the Eh in H2O2 during the reaction. (1) C = 10 ρ w M (2) w = 1.4862 × 10 − 10 e 3.8515 × 10 − 2 E h (3) ρ = 0.0045 w + 0.9781 (4) C = 0.0029 × 10 - 20 e 7.703 × 10 - 2 E h 2 + 0.4276 × 10 - 1 0 e 3.8515 × 10 - 2 E h 3.1.3 Influence of H2O2 concentration on reaction rate During the oxidation reaction process, the Eh value of the fluid decreased gradually with time as shown in Fig. 10 . (the Eh value of the fluid decreased gradually with the prolongation of oxidation time). It indicates that the shale sample reacts with H2O2 insistently in the all process of the experiments in one direction as long as there is a positive concentration based on the experiment plan in this study. Furthermore, the decrease of the Eh value was relatively fast in initial 24 h, which indicates that reaction rate is higher in the initial stage than that in the other stage. Similarly, Chen et al. (2017) reported that the dissolution rate of CL shale crushed samples (380–830 μm) by H2O2 obtained from the slope of fitting straight line of 0–24 h was 87 times greater than that of 48–240 h. In this study, the oxidative dissolution of shale is regarded as a surface reaction as determined by Fig. 11 . The reaction thus is assumed to run only on the liquid-solid interface. Referring to the kinetic reaction theory, the associated equation can be expressed as Eq. (5) (Li, 2009), and the oxidative dissolution between H2O2 and the organic-rich shale is defined as a typical multiphase reaction. Considering of the influence of differences across the shale samples size and the amount used of H2O2 in this study on the experimental results, the ratio of the fluid volume to the surface area of a sample (V/S) are introduced into Eq. (5), and the reaction rate can be calculated by Eq. (6). (Li, 2009, 2013). Fig. 12 shows that the average reaction rate decreases with time while increases with an increase in the molar concentration of H2O2. A high concentration gradient of H2O2 can help OH+ to easily flow through the diffusion boundary layer formed by reaction products on the sample surface and plays an important role in promoting the reaction rate according to Fick's diffusion law. Moreover, due to the fact that the reaction products cannot desorb and diffuse into solution in time and the increase of H2O2 consumption during the reaction, there is a gradual decrease in the reaction rate. In Fig. 13 , the reaction rate constant (K′) and reaction order (m) of Eq. (6) can be obtained by a power function fitting of the relationship between the average reaction rate vs. the concentration of H2O2, and they are 9.39 × 10−8 and 1.24, respectively.Then, the corresponding reaction kinetic equation under 40 °C is expressed as Eq. (7). A smaller K′ indicates that the reaction between shale and H2O2 occurs slower, and a large m indicates that the concentration of H2O2 plays a more significant role in the reaction rate (Fertani-Gmati et al., 2014). Furthermore, similar reaction kinetic equations are listed as Eqs. (8)–(11) under other different temperatures by substituting K′ and m from Table 4 into Eq. (6). (5) J = K C m (6) J ′ = ( C 1 − C 2 Δ t ) V S = K ′ C m (7) J ′ = 0.94 × 10 − 7 C H 2 O 2 1.24 ( 40 0 C ) (8) J ′ = 0.99 × 10 − 7 C H 2 O 2 1.27 ( 50 0 C ) (9) J ′ = 1.06 × 10 − 7 C H 2 O 2 1.32 ( 60 0 C ) (10) J ′ = 1.14 × 10 − 7 C H 2 O 2 1.43 ( 70 0 C ) (11) J ′ = 1.21 × 10 − 7 C H 2 O 2 1.46 ( 80 0 C ) 3.1.4 Influence of temperature on reaction rate Fig. 14 shows an increasing reaction rate between H2O2 and a shale sample with increasing temperature. Especially when the mass concentration of H2O2 is greater than 6%, the reaction rates quickly increase. This phenomenon coincides with the change in the reaction order with increasing temperature, as listed in Table 4. By observing the trend, an exponential function relationship between J′ and T can be obtained, indicating that the shale oxidative dissolution reaction obeys the Arrhenius reactions in this study, and the relationship between K and T thus can be described using Eq. (12) (Xu et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2015). If taking the role of H2O2 concentration into account, we can substitute Eq. (12) into Eq. (6) obtaining Eq. (13). The influence of T on J′ is shown in Fig. 15 , where a linear relationship between ln J′ and 1/T in Eq. (14) by taking the logarithm of Eq. (13) is shown. The activation energy (E a ) and frequency factor (K 0 ) can be calculated by the intercept and slope of the fitted straight line and the results are listed in Table 5 . Eq. (15) is the activation energy equation under 2% of mass concentration of H2O2, in which the activation energy of the oxidative dissolution of organic-rich shale is 3.51 kJ/mol. Similarly, the energy equations listed in Eq. (16)–(19) corresponding to other different mass concentrations of H2O2 the data from Table 5 into Eq. (13). It should be noted that formulas Eq. (15)–(19) are calculated based on the reaction kinetic equation at 80 °C according to the method reported from Kang et al. (12) K = K 0 E X P ( − E a R m T ) (13) J ′ = K 0 E X P ( − E a R m T ) C m (14) ln J ′ = − 1 T E a R m + ln ( K 0 C m ) (15) J ′ = 0.40 × 10 − 6 E X P ( − 3506.92 R m T ) C H 2 O 2 1.46 ( 2 % ) (16) J ′ = 0.84 × 10 − 6 E X P ( − 5578.44 R m T ) C H 2 O 2 1.46 ( 4 % ) (17) J ′ = 2.41 × 10 − 6 E X P ( − 9068.41 R m T ) C H 2 O 2 1.46 ( 6 % ) (18) J ′ = 5.58 × 10 − 6 E X P ( − 11148.74 R m T ) C H 2 O 2 1.46 ( 8 % ) (19) J ′ = 7.51 × 10 − 6 E X P ( − 12100.03 R m T ) C H 2 O 2 1.46 ( 10 % )"
7,Effect of oxidative dissolution on unpropped fracture conductivity,"3.2 Effect of oxidative dissolution on unpropped fracture conductivity A direct result of oxidative dissolution is the decrease of the shale sample masses, and the effect of the concentration and temperature on the reaction rate can be reflected by the change in the dissolved mass of the shale sample. Fig. 16 indicates that the average dissolved mass (q) not only increases with a temperature increase but also increases with an increase in the concentration of H2O2. This may indirectly prove the conclusion of the previous section, that increasing the concentration or temperature attributes an improved reaction rate. Meanwhile, the oxidative dissolution of a sample surface as judge from the color change due to the removal of OM and several naked visible induced microfracture,s are observed in Fig. 11. This section thereby focuses on the effect of oxidative dissolution on improving unpropped fracture conductivity, which can be evaluated according to the change of fracture width and fracture stress sensitivity before and after treatment with H2O2. 3.2.1 Increasing the fracture width According to the rock components and microfracture development in shale reservoirs, oxidative dissolution can preferentially occur in the fracture network (Li et al., 2018). Previous publications show that the oxidative dissolution of OM occurring on the fractures surface of coal may have a significant effect on increasing fracture width (Jing et al., 2018). For organic-rich shale, based on the mass change of the sliced samples before and after the treatment with H2O2 as measured during previous experiments, the increment of the fracture width due to oxidative dissolution can be calculated according to the method reported by Kang et al. (2016). Fig. 17ã e shows that under 40 °C, the fracture width directly relates to the dissolved mass per unit area of the shale samples, which increases and then trends to a stable state with reaction time. Interestingly, an increasing mass concentration of H2O2 can cause the time needed to become stable to increase and accompanies the increase of fracture width. For example, an increase of fracture width was 23.89 μm for the sample treated with 10% by weight H2O2, which is almost three times as much as that of the sample treated with 2% by weight H2O2. On the other hand, Fig. 17 f shows an increase in fracture width with the temperature at the same concentration and time, and the most significant increase of fracture width is 36.31 μm, in which the sample was treated with 10% by weight H2O2 for 72 h at 80 °C. 3.2.2 Reducing the stress sensitivity of unpropped fractures Fig. 18 a shows a decreasing tendency of the dimensionless permeability (the value that the permeability under test effective stress ratioes to permeability under initial effective stress) of both shale plugs with the increasing uploaded stress. The two curves are essentially overlapping when the uploaded stress is less than 10 MPa, while sample LY-3 treated with H2O2 shows a relatively higher dimensionless permeability with increasing stress than that of sample LY-1 treated with only DI water. Furthermore, higher dimensionless permeability occurs on sample LY-3 than that of sample LY-1 during the process of unloading stress. When the stress reaches 3 MPa, their dimensionless permeability is 0.39 and 0.30 respectively. Interestingly, for samples LY-2 and LY-4 with relatively low initial permeability, whether during loading or unloading process, sample LY-4 treated with H2O2 shows a higher dimensionless permeability than that of sample LY-2 treated with DI water, as shown in Fig. 18b. Their dimensionless permeabilities under a confining pressure of 3 MPa are 0.33 and 0.12, respectively. (20) S s = 1 − ( k i k 0 ) 1 / 3 lg σ i σ 0 The above phenomenon can be further characterized by the S S as shown in Eq. (20) for the fractured plugs, in which a larger S S indicates that the fracture width has a tendency to decrease under stress, causing a decrease in fracture permeability (Xiao et al., 2016). According to the calculation based on the data in Fig. 17, the Ss of the samples treated with DI water are 0.52 and 0.59, while the sample treated with H2O2 are 0.48 and 0.52. Considering that the LMX shale samples after exposure to DI water has a higher level of stress sensitivity than before treatment (Wang, 2014; Zhang and Sheng, 2017; Wu et al., 2019), the oxidative dissolution appears to be an effect method to reduce the stress sensitivity of shale fracture permeability rather than intensifying it. During stress loading, the brittle minerals in shale such as quartz in high concentrations play a significant role in resisting fracture closure (Kang et al., 2016). Compared to the clay minerals and OM, these minerals with a relatively higher Young's modulus can help the recovery of the fracture permeability during stress unloading (Li and Sakhaee Pour, 2016). Previous experiments have confirmed that the majority of minerals in a typical shale barely react with H2O2, except for pyrite, carbonate minerals and minimally chlorite (You et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2017). Taking into consideration the distribution of OM and pyrite in Fig. 2, oxidative dissolution shows a non-uniform surface-etching profile similar to the effect of diluted acid on carbonate-rich shale, forming or increasing surface asperities to resist the conductivity reduction due to the fracture closure (Wu and Sharma, 2017). Furthermore, Fig. 19 a shows that after soaking in DI water, no obvious hydration-induced micro-fractures on the shale sample surface occurred due to a weak effect of the hydration as observed by SEM of the fracture surface. However, after oxidation dissolution, a large number of micro-scale cracks were found, as shown in Fig. 19b and c. These observations are consistent with previous publications as shown in Fig. 19d ~ f, in which the oxidation-induced microfractures and pores always occur when OM or pyrite are present on a microscale (Chen et al., 2017; You et al., 2018; Hull et al., 2019). Therefore, these dissolution induced-microfractures can play a significant role in improving channels and forming surface asperities, allowing for maintained a relatively better fracture conductivity during the stress loading."
8,Implications for enhancement of shale gas recovery,"Hydraulic fracturing, an important technology for economic production of shale gas well, creates a complex fracture network unlocking shale gas resources. Water-based fracturing fluids, as the most effective operation fluids at present, are widely applied in the shale gas wells. Unfortunately, a larger number of fracturing fluid retention after the fracturing operations, arousing the formation damaged and impairing the stimulation effect of hydraulic operations (Bostrom et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). Moreover, the reduction of unpropped fracture aperture even closure with production time typically leads to a rapid decline in oil and gas production (Deng et al., 2013; Wu and Sharma, 2017). Because these unpropped fractures, which may be induced fractures branching from the main propped fractures or natural fractures, have a larger contact area with shale matrix than the propped fractures, which control a wider range of seepage zone (Carpenter, 2016; Wu and Sharma, 2017; You et al., 2018). Therefore, in the case that water phase retention is inevitable, the injection of oxidative reagents during the fracturing may play an important role in protecting and even improving the conductivity of these unpropped fractures under stress loading, which is likely to delay the rapid decline of gas well production and enhance shale gas recovery. However, the calculation of the average reaction rate extremely depends on the design of reaction time interval in experiment plan. For explame, a shorter reaction time interval will lead to a faster reaction rate calculated. Therefore, these experimental results in this study can be obtained only according to the experimental plans in this paper. Next, this study did not take into consideration the influence of pressure on the oxidative dissolution. Furthermore, it did not provide more experimental data exploring the influence of oxidative dissolution on the stress sensitivity for different fracture widths. Thus, more works on oxidative dissolution for improving unpropped fracture conductivity under simulated formation conditions are needed."
9,Conclusion,"Based on this study, the following conclusions are drawn: (1) Crushed LMX shale samples after exposure to H2O2 for 72 h had 56.87% of solid OM and 55.34% of extractable OM removed, and TOC concentration of H2O2 increased almost three times as much as that in the DI water at the same conditions. Some oxygen-containing functional groups (C–O) such as aromatic carbonyl/carboxyl, aliphatic ester, phenolic, phenoxy or hydroxyl, and ethers were oxidized and then cleaved, and meanwhile some organic adsorbed and occluded components were released from the geomacromolecules including kerogen, asphaltene and solid bitumen due to oxidation. It is the primary mechanism of oxidative dissolution of OM. (2) The reaction rate of oxidative dissolution significantly depends on the concentration and temperature of H2O2. The relationship between the reaction rate and concentration can be described with a power function, and the relationship between the reaction rate and temperature can be reflected as an exponential function. The activation energy of the oxidative dissolution of shale ranges from 3.51 to 12.10 kJ/mol with a mass concentration of H2O2 from 2% to 10% by weight. (3) Oxidative dissolution of shale components can increase fracture width while reducing the stress sensitivity of unpropped fracture due to the non-uniform surface-etching profile and oxidation-induced pores and microfractures, which shows promising potential on maintaining and improving unpropped fracture conductivity. (4) The injection of oxidative reagents during the fracturing may play a role in protecting and even improving the conductivity of the unpropped fractures under stress loading, which is likely to delay the rapid decline of gas well production decline and enhance shale gas recovery."
