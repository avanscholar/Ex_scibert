0,Introduction,"Hydrogen ( H 2 ) is a clean and promising fuel when it is ultimately derived from renewable energy sources. It is also efficient and environmentally friendly, since it has high energy content, and water is the sole end product after combustion [1,2]. H 2 can be produced sustainably by anaerobic bacteria degrading carbohydrate-rich substrates to organic acids, H 2 and CO 2 . Dark-fermentation of carbohydrate-rich substrates as biomass presents a promising route of biological H 2 production, compared with photosynthetic routes [3]. For example, fermentative H 2 process produces H 2 at higher rate (0.5– 65.0 l H 2 l - 1 d - 1 ) than light driven process (0.04– 4.3 l H 2 l - 1 d - 1 ) [4]. In addition, the major advantages are rapid bacterial growth rates, low energy demands, minimal pollution generation, operation without light sources, no oxygen limitation problems and low capital costs for at least small-scale production facilities (100– 1000 l H 2 h - 1 ) [4,5]. The isolation and identification of fermentative H 2 producers with a high yield and high production rate of H 2 are important for development of commercial sustainable biohydrogen production process. Various H 2 -producing strains including species of Enterobacter spp. [6], Clostridium spp. [7] and Bacillus spp. [8] have been identified and studied. Among the H 2 producers, mesophilic bacteria have been studied most extensively. Normally, it is observed that H 2 production yield of 1– 2 mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose are obtained with mesophiles, while thermophiles display a yield higher than 2 mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose [9]. H 2 yields can be improved by increasing H 2 production through acetate end product reaction, and decreasing or preventing butyrate, ethanol and propionate product reaction. One way to accomplish this is through fermentation process with thermophiles or extreme thermophiles, operating at temperatures higher than 60 ∘ C [9,10]. Thus, a higher temperature is more feasible for the conversion reaction toward H 2 due to favorable thermodynamics conditions. Thermophilic bacteria are therefore considered as most promising microorganisms than mesophilic bacteria for H 2 production [11]. Maximum theoretically H 2 production yield could be obtained by thermophilic (50– 55 ∘ C ) bacteria or extreme thermophilic (55– 80 ∘ C ) bacteria [9]. Thermophilic bacteria are able to utilize a wide range of organic wastes [12]. Thermophilic mixed and pure cultures have been examined for their potential as H 2 producers [13–15]. High H 2 production rate and less variety of fermentation end products were observed under thermophilic conditions compared to mesophilic ones [16]. These properties make application of thermophiles for H 2 production economically and technical feasible. However, a limited number of bacteria can convert carbohydrate into H 2 with a satisfactory yield and productivity. The aim of the present study is to isolate, characterize and identify a thermophilic fermentative bacterium from a sequencing batch reactor digesting palm oil mill effluent for continuous H 2 production. Operational conditions for optimal H 2 production process in terms of carbon and nitrogen sources, temperature and pH were investigated. Metabolic pathways and kinetic parameters for hydrogen production from glucose were identified."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Isolation of the bacterial strain,"2.1 Isolation of the bacterial strain Anaerobic sludge was obtained from a H 2 -producing anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) running at steady state conditions for approximately 3 months. ASBR was operated at 60 ∘ C with a hydraulic retention time of 2d and organic loading rate of 60 g COD l - 1 d - 1 in continuous mode. The palm oil mill effluent (POME) was fed into the reactor as substrate. The sludge sample was transferred anaerobically (under N2:CO2=80:20) into 50ml BA medium prepared as previously described [17]. The medium was further supplemented with sucrose 10 g l - 1 and incubated at 60 ∘ C for 24h at strict anaerobic conditions. The culture was then serially diluted in the same medium solidified by 0.3% (w/v) Gelrite (Kelco) and incubated anaerobically at the same temperature as that used for the primary enrichment. Colonies from each dilution series were inoculated to fresh liquid medium and analyzed further for H 2 production. The strain with the highest level of H 2 production was named PSU-2. In this study, the characterization of PSU-2 isolate and its H 2 production properties were investigated."
3,Microscopic examination and biochemical tests,"2.2 Microscopic examination and biochemical tests Characterization and morphology of the strain PSU-2 isolate were determined according to Bergey's manual of determinative bacteriology [18]. Morphological studies were performed with light microscope (Eclipse E400; Nikon) equipped with digital camera (Nikon) and a transmission electron microscope, JEM-2010, JEOL. Gram staining was performed by Hucker method [19]. For biochemical characterization, substrate utilization and fermentation end products profiles were investigated. Arabinose, fructose, galactose, glucose, mannose, rhamnose, xylose, cellobiose, lactose, maltose, sucrose, trehalose, raffinose, inulin, pectin, starch, xylan, cellulose, mannitol and glycerol were tested for hydrogen production at concentration of 10 g l - 1 ."
4,Strain identification,"2.3 Strain identification Total genomic DNA was extracted from strain PSU-2 isolate using the Ultraclean Soil DNA Kit (MoBio Laboratory Inc., USA). The region of the 16S rRNA genes corresponding to position 27–1492 in the 16S rRNA of Escherichia coli was PCR-amplified using 16SF ( 5 ′ -GAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG- 3 ′ ) and 16SR ( 5 ′ -GAAAGGAGGTGATCCAGCC- 3 ′ ), as described by Dahle and Birkeland [20]. The double stranded PCR products were sequenced using an ABI PRISM Big Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Closest matches for partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were identified by database searches in GenBank using BLAST [21]. Alignments for phylogenetic analysis were made by using CLUSTAL X [22]. Phylogenetic trees were then constructed using the neighbor-joining method with MEGA 2.1 [23]. Bootstrapings analysis [24] for 1000 replicates was performed to estimate the confidence of tree topologies. The DNA base composition of strain PSU-2 was determined by HPLC as described elsewhere [25]."
5,H 2 production in batch,"2.4 H 2 production in batch In batch fermentation H 2 production, 10ml of microbial suspension at exponential growth phase ( OD 660 = 0.5 ) was transferred into 90ml basic anaerobic (BA) medium supplemented with sucrose as carbon source to final concentration of 10 g l - 1 . Medium was dispensed anaerobically in 250ml serum bottle capped with rubber stopper and closed with aluminum caps. The headspace was replaced with nitrogen gas. To determine the effects of operating parameters (temperature, initial pH, type and concentration of substrate) on H 2 production, pH value, type and concentration of substrates, temperature and nitrogen source were alternately varied. The pH was set to various levels (in the range of 4.0–9.0 with increments of 0.5) in serum bottle using 2N HCl and 2N NaOH. The incubation temperature was varied from 35 to 80 ∘ C with increments of 5 ∘ C . The concentrations of all components in medium except for sucrose concentration were fixed in experiment to study the effect of substrate concentration. Sucrose concentrations in the medium varied from 5 to 50 g l - 1 with increments of 5 g l - 1 . All experiments were done in triplicates. Liquid samples from the serum bottles were taken for the analysis of pH, substrate utilization and fermentation end products. The volumetric H 2 production rate ( ml H 2 l - 1 h - 1 ) was calculated from the total gas production rate and the concentration of H 2 in the headspace. The molar H 2 production rate ( mmol H 2 l - 1 h - 1 ) was calculated using the ideal gas law as molar H 2 production rate ( mmol H 2 l - 1 h - 1 ) = volumetric H 2 production rate ( ml H 2 l - 1 h - 1 ) / ( RT ) , where R = 8.314472 ( 15 ) J K - 1 mol - 1 equal to R = 0.08205784 L atm K - 1 mol - 1 , and T = 333 K [26]. Hydrogen production yield was calculated as total molaric amount of H 2 divided by molaric amount of consumed sucrose ( mmol H 2 / mmol sucrose ) . Cell growth was initially investigated based on simple Monod equation [27]. Linearization of Monod equation was done to find out the kinetics parameters with the help of Lineweaver–Burk plot. Regression analysis was used to find the best fit for a straight line on a plot of 1 / μ vs 1/S to predict values of μ max and K S , where μ is specific growth rate ( h - 1 ) , S is substrate concentration ( g l - 1 ) , μ max is maximum specific growth rate ( h - 1 ) and K S is half saturation constant ( g l - 1 ) . The effect of nitrogen source on the hydrogen production yield and growth of strain PSU-2 was observed with modified BA medium where inorganic nitrogen source NH 4 Cl was replaced by organic nitrogen source (peptone) to final concentration of 1 g l - 1 . The effect of nitrogen source was studied with 10 g l - 1 of glucose, sucrose and starch as carbon sources. The C:N ratios in inorganic nitrogen medium of glucose, sucrose and starch were 38:1, 75:1 and 770:1, respectively. The C:N ratios in organic nitrogen medium of glucose, sucrose and starch were 35:1, 71:1 and 714:1, respectively."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods The cell concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 660nm using spectrophotometer. One unit of absorbance is equal to 0.45 g dry cell l - 1 . The volume of gas produced was recorded daily using a gas meter with water displacement method. The H 2 concentration in the gas phase was measured by using a gas chromatograph (MicroLab, Arhus, Denmark) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a s-m stainless column packed with Porapak Q (50/80 mesh). Fermentation liquid end products (volatile fatty acids and ethanol) were determined by gas chromatograph (HP 5890 series II) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and HP FFAP column (dimensions 30 m × 0.53 mm × 1.0 mm ). The GC-TCD and GC-FID conditions were set according to Liu et al. [28]. Lactate and formate were determined by suppressed ion chromatography, which consisted of HPLC pump (HP 1100, Waldbronn, Germany). Sucrose was analyzed by phenol–sulfuric acid method [29] and volatile suspended solids (VSS) were measured according to the standard methods [30]."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Identification and phenotypic characterization,"3.1 Identification and phenotypic characterization Isolated H 2 -producing bacteria have a rod shape, with a length from 0.3 to 2.3 μ m . The cells had a rounded ends and spore forming. They occurred singly or in pairs, though rarely in chains (Fig. 1 ). They exhibited gram-positive staining in lag growth phase. 16S rRNA analysis revealed that PSU-2 is a member of the genus Thermoanaerobacterium. The closet phylogenetic relative was Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum DSM571 (formerly Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum), where the recorded similarity of the 16S rRNA genes was 98% of 1478bp. The 16S rRNA accession number at GenBank and EMBL databases is AM408569. A phylogenetic tree was constructed (Fig. 2 ). The phenotypic characteristics properties of isolate PSU-2 were also consistent with those of the Thermoanaerobacterium spp. and most of them have been reported to produce H 2 [31–33]. Several species of the genus Thermoanaerobacterium are known for their H 2 production characteristics, including T. thermosaccharolyticum, T. polysaccharolyticum, T. zeae, T. lactoethylicum and T. aotearoense. All these organisms have optimal growth conditions at 55– 70 ∘ C and at pH 5.2–7.8 [34]. The PSU-2 isolate showed growth with various type of carbohydrate as the sole carbon and energy source under thermophilic condition (Table 1 ). As shown in Table 1, the substrate spectrum of strain PSU-2 comprises a variety of macromolecules such as starch, dextran and xylan. The substrate spectrum of PSU-2 except rhamnose and dextran was identical to the one of the T. thermosaccharolyticum type strain, DSM571, while except peptone was identical to T. thermosaccharolyticum strain FH1. Thus we concluded on the basis of the 16S rRNA gene analysis and the substrate spectrum that PSU-2 represents a new strain within the species T. thermosaccharolyticum. Effective fermentative bacteria should use various type of substrates especially complex carbohydrate [10,33]. Therefore, the level of H 2 production of T. thermosaccharolyticum PSU-2 from various types of carbohydrates was examined. The concentration of each substrate was fixed at 10 g l - 1 . T. thermosaccharolyticum PSU-2 was able to produce H 2 from various types of carbohydrate (Fig. 3 ). The highest level of H 2 production, around 250 ml H 2 g - 1 substrate, was obtained from starch, xylose and sucrose. However, H 2 production from xylan and cellulose was quite low (54 and 44 ml H 2 g - 1 substrate, respectively). The low hydrogen production from xylan and cellulose could be explained with end fermentation products profile. Propionate was the main end product from xylan fermentation, while ethanol was the main end product from cellulose fermentation (data not shown). Formation of reduced metabolites as propionate and ethanol was already shown to disfavor hydrogen production [5]. There have been many reports indicating that Thermoanaerobacterium spp. possess the capability to utilize complex carbohydrate such as starch, xylan, cracked corn, cellulose and simple sugar accompanied with H 2 and acid production [15,17,32,33]. The ability of the bacterium to utilize complex carbohydrate demonstrates its capability to produce H 2 from renewable resources such as biomass [34]. Thus strain PSU-2 could be a promising candidate for the thermophilic fermentative H 2 production with possible application for H 2 production from organic wastewater that usually contains a mixture of sugars."
9,Effect of operational parameters on H 2 production,"3.2 Effect of operational parameters on H 2 production The H 2 production of strain PSU-2 was highly dependent on fermentation conditions such as pH, temperature and substrate concentration (Fig. 4 ). The PSU-2 isolate was strict anaerobe and favored the growth in weak acidic environment. The maximum growth rate was observed at pH 6.25, while no or poor growth was observed below pH 4. At pH 5.5 and 6.5, growth was favored compared to higher pH values, showing the acid tolerance nature of PSU-2 isolate, which was in consensus with reported values [35]. Low pH (pH 4) facilitates formation of acidic metabolites, which may destabilize the cell's ability to maintain internal pH, resulting in the lowering of intracellular level of ATP and inhibiting substrate uptake [36]. Higher pH (7.0–9.0) restricted the growth of bacterium and also the H 2 production [7]. Fig. 4A shows the H 2 yields of PSU-2 isolate at different pH levels. At pH 6.25, the maximum cell yield, H 2 production rate and yield were 0.267 g cell g - 1 sucrose, 5.73 mmol H 2 l - 1 h - 1 and 4.91 mol H 2 mol - 1 sucrose, respectively. Therefore, the results obtained showed that a pH 6.25 is optimal for the growth and H 2 production of PSU-2. The growth of stain PSU-2 was observed at temperatures from 45 to 65 ∘ C with optimal temperature of 60 ∘ C . This is in a range previously reported for the genus Thermoanaerobacterium [37]. Cell yield, H 2 production yield and rate of strain T. thermosaccharolyticum PSU-2, a moderate thermophile, decreased when temperature was elevated above 60 ∘ C (Fig. 4B). Dropped of cell yield, H 2 production yield and rate at temperatures higher than 60 ∘ C could be attributed to protein deactivation [38]. The initial substrate concentration usually plays an important role in H 2 production [39]. The isolate PSU-2 was used to investigate the effect of substrate concentration on cell yield and H 2 production. Sucrose with different concentrations (5– 50 g l - 1 ) at pH 6.5 was tested in batch cultures. It was observed that the H 2 production rate and cells yield of PSU-2 increased positively with sucrose concentration up to 20 g l - 1 and then H 2 production rate decreased gradually along with increasing sucrose concentration (Fig. 4C). Cell yield and rate of H 2 production decreased when sucrose concentration increases above 20 g l - 1 . The most probable reason is substrate inhibition [8], end products inhibition [13] or combination between both types of inhibition. The end product inhibition may be due to accumulation of acetate, it being a weak acid, and therefore impairing the growth and also increasing osmolality. The increase of sucrose concentration also contributes to the osmolality [40]. When the concentration of sucrose was 20 g l - 1 , the maximum H 2 production rate of 12.12 mmol l - 1 h - 1 was achieved. In contrast H 2 production yield decreased with increasing sucrose concentration, decreased from 5.45 mol H 2 mol - 1 sucrose ( 5 g l - 1 ) to 0.87 mol H 2 mol - 1 sucrose ( 50 g l - 1 ) . This implies that hydrogen production by T. thermosaccharolyticum PSU-2 is a compromise between technical efficiency based on H 2 yield and economic efficiency based on H 2 production rate when substrate concentration is increased. Cell growth and substrate consumption kinetics of strain PSU-2 were investigated with Monod model. Lineweaver–Burk plots were considered to predict the values of maximum specific growth rate ( μ max ) and half-saturation constant ( K S ) (Fig. 5 ). The values of μ max and K S of strain PSU-2 were 0.31 h - 1 and 1.47 g l - 1 , respectively, using sucrose as a substrate."
10,H 2 production and soluble metabolites production characteristics,"3.3 H 2 production and soluble metabolites production characteristics Fig. 6 A shows the pH and biomass concentration during fermentation of sucrose when the initial pH was not controlled. The pH decreased from 6.0 to 4.2 within 24h. The decrease of pH was attributed to the accumulation of organic acids. As fermentation progresses, various organic acids (mainly acetate and butyrate) accumulate resulting in a significant decrease in pH in the culture medium. This decrease in pH caused a significant decrease in H 2 production. H 2 production began when cell growth entered the early exponential phase (4h) and the rate of H 2 production reached a maximum in the late exponential phase (Fig. 6B). Most of H 2 was produced in the late exponential phase and early stationary phase. H 2 production was accompanied with the production of VFA and alcohols. T. thermosaccharolyticum PSU-2 produced H 2 through acetate and butyrate as main fermentation end products. Low amounts of propionic acid and lactic acid were produced by this strain (Fig. 6C). Butyric acid and acetic acid constituted more than 80% of total end products. In general, production of these two organic acids favors the production of H 2 , according to Eqs. (1) and (2). Theoretically, 4mol of H 2 are produced from 1mol of glucose in acetate ( C 2 H 4 O 2 ) type fermentation: (1) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 4 H 2 + 2 CO 2 + 2 C 2 H 4 O 2 , with only 2mol of H 2 produced when butyrate ( C 4 H 8 O 2 ) is the main fermentation product: (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 2 H 2 + 2 CO 2 + C 4 H 8 O 2 . It has been reported that butyric acid to acetic acid (B/A) ratios are directly proportional to H 2 yields [41]. The B/A ratios observed in batch culture ranged from 0.9 to 1.1 on a molar basis. Therefore, in this study, Eq. (3) was used to characterize the stoichiometric reaction for the production of H 2 from glucose using a B/A ratio of 1.0. (3) 3 C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 8 H 2 + 6 CO 2 + 2 C 2 H 4 O 2 + 2 C 4 H 8 O 2 . This would result in a theoretical H 2 yield of 2.67 mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose. Experimental H 2 yield of 5.06 mol H 2 mol - 1 sucrose recorded in our experiments was obtained with sucrose at initial concentrations of 5 g L - 1 producing 2.53 mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose. However, this value is still lower than the theoretical maximal value, but this could be explained by the conversion of some of the substrate into microbial biomass. Kim et al. [41] reported that approximately 11% of the substrate, sucrose, is converted to microbial biomass. The maximum H 2 production rate and yield of strain PSU-2 were 12.12 mmol H 2 l - 1 h - 1 and 2.53 mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose, respectively. Maximum H 2 production yields from different reported strains were compared with that of PSU-2 isolate. Thermotoga elfii [42], Calidicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus [9], C. thermocellum [43], C. thermolacticum [44], C. thermobutyricum [45] and C. thermosaccharolyticum [46] are known to posses H 2 -producing abilities under thermophilic and hyperthermophilic conditions, corresponding to 2.7, 3.3, 1.95, 1.5, 1.9 and 1.72 mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose, respectively. Strain PSU-2 had H 2 yield nearly equivalent to those of T. elfii and C. saccharolyticus."
11,Effect of nitrogen source on growth of strain PSU-2,"3.4 Effect of nitrogen source on growth of strain PSU-2 The volume of produced hydrogen ( ml l - 1 ) , H 2 yield ( mol H 2 mol - 1 substrate), cell yield ( g cell g - 1 substrate) and concentrations of fermentation by-products during 2d cultivation are summarized in Table 2 . During 2d of batch cultivation, PSU-2 produced 2195ml of H 2 gas per liter of inorganic nitrogen amended medium, and 6762ml of gas per liter of organic nitrogen amended medium using sucrose as substrate. Organic nitrogen amendment medium improved the H 2 production with 68% compared to inorganic nitrogen amended medium. Source of nitrogen, organic or inorganic, resulted in different metabolic profiles of hydrogen production. The productivity of ethanol in inorganic nitrogen amended medium was increased 3 times (10.5–10.9mM) when compared with organic nitrogen amended medium (2.4–2.9mM). Acetate production in inorganic nitrogen amended medium was in the same levels in both medium when using glucose and starch a carbon sources, while it increased 2 times (17.8mM) compared to organic nitrogen amended medium (8.1mM) when using sucrose as carbon source. In contrast, butyrate production in organic nitrogen amended medium was increased 10 times (6–11.6mM) compared to inorganic nitrogen amended medium (0.5–1.4mM). Propionate was not produced in presence of either organic or inorganic nitrogen source. Strain PSU-2 tends to grow and produced more H 2 when medium contains organic nitrogen source. C:N ratios of inorganic nitrogen amended medium (38:1) and organic nitrogen amended medium (35:1) were almost the same, and the increase of bacterial biomass and hydrogen production was most probably due to peptone, a source of amino acids which can be essential growth factors for the bacteria. Strain PSU-2 performs ethanol–acetate type fermentation in inorganic nitrogen amended medium and butyrate–acetate type fermentation in organic nitrogen amended medium. The nitrogen source in the medium affected the substrates fermentation of T. thermosaccharolyticum PSU-2, caused a change in H 2 yield. H 2 production yield ( 2.53 mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose) of butyrate–acetate type fermentation was high, whereas H 2 production yield ( 0.75 mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose) of ethanol–acetate type fermentation was low (Fig. 7 ). H 2 yield was about 3 times higher than the maximum H 2 yield quantified when strain PSU-2 was cultivated in inorganic nitrogen amended medium. The different fermentation yields in the medium used were due to the difference in the nitrogen source. The presence of peptone as organic nitrogen source enhanced production of H 2 by strain PSU-2. The cell yield in presence of organic nitrogen amended medium increased 2 times compared to inorganic nitrogen amended medium. The utilization of such organic nitrogen sources could be energetically more advantageous from aspect of cell material synthesis [15,33]. Results obtained showed that presence of organic nitrogen resulted in a complete shift in the metabolism of the cell, production of butyrate, which was accompanied by further production of ATP and additional reducing power. H 2 can be produced if surplus electrons are formed in the reaction, and then protons are reduced by hydrogenase [47]. Deficient organic nitrogen in medium prevented the H 2 production by the bacteria and modified metabolic pattern toward the production of reduced end product such as ethanol [33]. Therefore, it appears that the organic nitrogen amendment could be responsible for increased H 2 production. The fact that ethanol was obtained in similar concentrations as acetate for all cultivations, where inorganic nitrogen amended media were used, explains the decrease of H 2 yield to less than 2 mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose. In case of H 2 production associated with ethanol production, mixed acetate–ethanol type fermentation could be described with following equation: (4) C 6 H 12 O 6 + H 2 O → 2 H 2 + 2 CO 2 + C 2 H 4 O 2 + C 2 H 6 O . Therefore, in case of H 2 production associated with butyrate, the fermentation pathway could be described with Eq. (3). It was proposed that shift of ethanol–acetate type fermentation to butyrate–acetate type fermentation is due to organic nitrogen amendment. The suggested metabolic pathway deduced for carbohydrate fermentation by strain PSU-2 was shown in Fig. 7. Organic nitrogen stimulation for butyrate–acetate type fermentation achieved maximum H 2 production yield of 2.67 mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose. Inorganic nitrogen stimulation for ethanol–acetate type fermentation achieved maximum H 2 production yield of 1.0 mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose."
12,Conclusions,"A strict anaerobic thermophilic bacterial strain with high production rate and yield of H 2 , named T. thermosaccharolyticum PSU-2, was isolated. T. thermosaccharolyticum PSU-2 appeared a suitable candidate for the thermophilic fermentative H 2 production due to its capacity to use various types of carbon source, acid tolerance and high H 2 production rate. The level of fermentative H 2 production by this strain was influenced by the medium pH and the initial sucrose concentration. The optimum initial sucrose concentration, pH and temperature were 20 g l - 1 , 6.25 and 60 ∘ C , respectively, which resulted in a respective maximum H 2 productivity of 12.12 mmol H 2 l - 1 h - 1 . This strain might be applicable to the treatment plant of organic wastewater that usually contains a mixture of sugar."
