0,Introduction,"The stability of proteins can be influenced by environmental stresses such as heat and cold stresses, or detergent and solvent stresses [1–4]. The mechanism of adaptation to stresses is in general by accumulation of small molecules known as osmolytes [1–3]. The osmolytes (e.g., polyols, sugars and amino acids) are accumulated in intracellular environment under different stress conditions and protect protein structures without perturbing their functional groups [5–8]. Osmolytes such as sorbitol, sucrose and glycerol are also commonly used for protein stabilization in biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries [7,9–11].The osmolytes usually stabilize protein structures through preferential hydration or preferential exclusion [11–13]. Unlike osmolytes, monohydric alcohols such as methanol exhibit denaturing effect on tertiary structures of protein [14–16]. The disruptive effect of the alcohols on the structure of proteins varies significantly by the type of used alcohol, and correlates with the alcohol’s hydrophobicity [15,17,18]. Despite that, alcohols have attracted attention as they mimic the microenvironments near or in cellular membranes [14,19]. Although most of proteins are soluble, many require transport across cellular membranes to reach their destinations in cells, or function in proximity to membranes [14,19]. While interactions between individual osmolytes and proteins have been studied extensively and their effects on protein structures are well-established [20–22], much less is known about the effects of mixtures of stabilizing osmolytes and destabilizing solvents (or destabilizing osmolytes such as urea and alcohols) [23–26]. This is despite the fact that mixtures of protein – stabilizing, and –destabilizing osmolytes are always present in cells, highlighting the importance of studying such combinatorial effects on protein structures [27–29]. In one such study, it was shown that the stabilizing osmolytes, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) mitigates the denaturation effect of urea on chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 [27]. In additions, Pazhang et al. indicated that trehalose and glycerol stabilize thermolysin effectively in the presence of hydrophilic (DMF) and hydrophobic (n-propanol) solvents, respectively [9]. Another study has shown that the stabilization effect of polyols (sorbitol and glycerol) on trypsin has a correlation with log P of solvents and the molecular properties of polyols [10]. However, due to the limited number of studies on the combinatorial effect of osmolytes, our current understanding of the mixture effects on protein stability remains elusive. Maycobacterial pyrazinamidase (PZase) is a metalloenzyme with 185 residues [30],which converts pyrazinamide (PZA), an important first-line drug used in the short-course treatment of tuberculosis [31], into its active form of pyrazinoic acid [32]. It has been suggested that PZA resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is ascribed to mutations in pncA gene which affect the enzyme activity and stability [33–37]. Doustdar et al. have shown that the PZA- resistant Mycobacteriums have PZases with decreased stability [38]. Therefore, the stability of PZase in the bacterial cell plays an important role in the effectiveness of tuberculosis treatment with PZA. Consequently, the study of the enzyme stability in the mixture of stabilizer and destabilizer molecules will provide insight into the stability of PZase in cellular environment. In this work, the activity and stability of PZase were studied in the absence and presence of alcohols (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and n-propanol). Also, the combinatorial effect of osmolytes (sorbitol, sucrose and glycerol) and alcohols on the thermostability of PZase was investigated. Our results showed that methanol decreases PZase stability unexpectedly. To better understand the mechanism underlying this unexpected issue, we employed molecular dynamics simulation to study the structure of PZase in more detail, in the presence of methanol. The results showed that methanol can replace the water molecules on the hydration shell of PZase and can interact with the hydrophobic residues of the protein, and therefore destabilize the enzyme structure."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals and Bacterial Strains,"2.1 Chemicals and Bacterial Strains E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA) was used for the expression of recombinant enzymes. Ni-NTA sepharose columns were purchased from QIAGEN, USA. Other chemicals were prepared from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany)."
3,The recombinant enzyme expression and purification,"2.2 The recombinant enzyme expression and purification To produce recombinant PZase, E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed by previously- constructed pET-28a (+) vector harboring PZase gene from Mycobacterium tuberculosisis strain H37Rv [38]. Transformed cells were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 50μg/ml kanamycin for 16hours at 37°C with shaking at 250rpm. Then, 2ml of the culture was inoculated into 200ml of the fermentation media (with 50μg/ml kanamycin). The expression of recombinant enzyme was induced by isopropylthio-D-galactoside (IPTG) and the cells were incubated overnight at 22°Cwith shaking at 200rpm. The cells in 200ml culture were centrifuged at 10000×g for 20min, re-suspended in 50mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0). The bacterial cells were disrupted by sonication, and protein purification was carried out by Ni-NTA agaroseas previously described [30]. Finally, the purified enzyme was dialyzed against 50mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5)."
4,Enzyme assay and protein concentration determination,"2.3 Enzyme assay and protein concentration determination The enzyme activity was measured by a modified Wayne test [39]. The reaction mixture containing 60mM PZA, 500mM Tris (pH 7.5) and 2mM mercaptoethanol was prepared. After adding 50μl of the enzyme solution (200μg/ml) to 50μl of the reaction mixture, the enzymatic reaction mixture was incubated at 37° for 3min. Following this, 890ml of 0.1M Gly − HCL (pH 3.4) and 10ml of 20% FeNH4(SO4)2 were added to the enzyme reaction mixture, and then the precipitates were collected by centrifugation (15000×g for 5min), and the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 480nm. One unit of the enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce 1μmol of pyrazinoic acid in 1min using pyrazinoic acid as a standard. Protein concentration was measured by Bradford [40] using bovine serum albumin as a standard."
5,Enzyme activity in alcohols,"2.4 Enzyme activity in alcohols To study the effects of alcohols on the activity of PZase in the presence of alcohols, the desired concentration (0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35% and 40% (v/v)) of the alcohols (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and n-propanol) were prepared in the enzymatic reaction mixtures in pH 7.5. Then the enzyme activity was measured in the different concentration of the alcohols."
6,Thermostability in alcohols in the absence and presence of polyols,"2.5 Thermostability in alcohols in the absence and presence of polyols The time course of irreversible thermo-inactivation was determined by incubation of the enzyme solutions at 40°C in the absence and presence of the alcohols (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and n-propanol). For thermostability measurement, the effect of different concentrations (5% to 30%) of each alcohol on the thermostability of PZase was examined. The results indicated that differential effects on the thermostability of the enzymes are most prominent when using 10% (v/v) of alcohols (data not shown). As a result, to determine the thermostability of PZase, the enzyme solutions containing 0.2mg/ml of the enzyme in10% of alcohols were incubated at 40 °C. At regular intervals, samples were removed, cooled on ice for 30minute (for protein refolding and termination of the enzyme thermal inactivation). Finally, the residual activity was determined at 25 °C as described above. In each experiment, the activity of the enzyme solution kept on ice was considered as a control (100%)."
7,Circular Dichroism (CD) measurements,"2.6 Circular Dichroism (CD) measurements CD spectra were recorded in far-UV (200–250nm) and near-UV (260–320nm) ranges on a Jasco spectropolarimeter J-715 (Tokyo, Japan) for 0.2mg/ml and 1.5mg/ml of PZase in 50mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5), respectively, using 1mm path length quartz cell. The secondary structure parameters were evaluated using J700 CD-JASCO software. To obtain the CD spectra of PZase in the presence of different alcohols, the CD spectra of the enzyme were measured in the presence of 10% (v/v) of each alcohol in far-UV and near-UV ranges."
8,Fluorescence intensity spectra,2.7 Fluorescence intensity spectra Tryptophan fluorescence of PZase was measured using a Perkin Elmer luminescence spectrometer LS 55 in the absence (control) and presence of 10% (v/v) of alcohols. Samples were excited at 295nm and the emission was recorded between 300 to 400nm. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (25°C) and the protein concentration was 20μg/ml in 50mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5).
9,Effect of osmolytes on the enzyme thermostability in the presence of alcohols,"2.8 Effect of osmolytes on the enzyme thermostability in the presence of alcohols To examine the effects of osmolytes (sorbitol, sucrose and glycerol) on the thermostability of PZase in the presence of different alcohols, enzyme solutions (0.2mg/ml) containing 20% (w/v) of sorbitol and sucrose or 20% (v/v) of glycerol were prepared in the presence of 10% (v/v) of each alcohol. The solutions were then incubated at 40 °C for different times and the residual activity of each sample was determined after cooling on ice. For these experiments, enzyme/alcohol/osmolyte solutions that were kept on ice were considered as a control (100%)."
10,Calculation of half-life and k in of PZase,"2.9 Calculation of half-life and k in of PZase For measuring the half-life and rate constant of enzyme inactivation (k in), the residual activity versus incubation time was evaluated. In this study, the decrease in the logarithm of residual activity with respect to the duration of enzyme incubation was linear, which shows that enzyme inactivation is a first order reaction. Therefore, the following equations were used to determine the rate constant of enzyme inactivation (k in) and the half-life of the enzyme, respectively: ln ( A c t i v i t y ) = ln ( A c t i v i t y ) 0 − k i n t a n d H a l f l i f e = 0.693 k i n"
11,Computational methods,"2.10 Computational methods All molecular dynamics simulations were done using the GROMACS simulation package, versions 4.5.4 [41]. The GROMOS 96 force fields were implemented in the GROMACS [42]. The starting conformation for the simulations of the enzyme was obtained from Protein Data Bank (PDB ID, 3PL1 [30]).The protein was solvated with either simple point charge (SPC) water [43] or a mixture of methanol and water, and placed in a cube large enough to contain the proteins and 1.1nm of solvent on all sides. For a neutral simulation cell, water molecules at the most positive or negative electrical potential were replaced with the counter ions Cl− and Na+, respectively. The GROMACS topologies of methanol were generated by Automated Topology Builder (ATB) server [44]. All force field parameters for these molecules were defined based on the existing GROMOS 96 parameter set [42]. In all simulations, temperature (300K) and pressure (1bar) were controlled by Berendsen algorithm with гT =0.1ps and гP =0.1ps, respectively [43]. Lennard-Jones interactions were calculated with a 0.9/1.4nm twin-range cut off. Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm used for handling the long-range interactions and the short-range electrostatic interactions were calculated to 0.8nm [45]. Neighbor lists were updated every 10 steps. A time step of 2fs was used for the integration of equation of motion. Bond length was constrained using the LINCS algorithm [41]. All atoms were given an initial velocity obtained from a Maxwellian distribution at the desired initial temperature. All of the MD simulations were then energy-minimized by steepest descent energy minimization. Then, the restraints on PZase were removed and systems were simulated for 1000ps under constant volume conditions, and finally the equilibration was completed with a 1000ps of NPT simulation. After equilibration, the production runs at the constant temperature and pressure conditions were 150ns long."
12,Results,
13,The activity of PZase in the presence of organic solvents,"3.1 The activity of PZase in the presence of organic solvents To study the effect of the alcohols on the activity of the enzyme, PZase activity was determined in the presence of different concentrations of the solvents (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and n-propanol). Our results indicated that the decrease in the enzyme activity is larger in the presence of methanol compared to other alcohols (Fig. 1 ). On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 1, isopropanol had the least effect on the activity of PZase."
14,The effect of alcohols on the thermostability of PZase,"3.2 The effect of alcohols on the thermostability of PZase It has been shown that the destabilizing effect of organic solvents such as alcohols directly correlates with their log P, with larger log P’s corresponding to more destabilization effects [10,14]. To examine the stability of PZase in different alcohol solutions, we incubated the enzyme at 40°C for different durations in the absence and presence of 10% of the alcohols. Our results indicated that the half-life of the enzyme decreased significantly compared to the control (with half- life of 173.2min) in the presence of the solvents (Fig. 2 and Table 1 ). Interestingly, our results showed that the thermostability of PZase decreases with an increase in solvent’s log P (hydrophobicity), except for methanol (Table 1). Therefore, contrary to previous reports, we observe a shorter half-life (20.3min) for the enzyme in methanol compared to that of the enzyme in ethanol (half-life=31.5min), despite the smaller log P of methanol."
15,The effect of the alcohols on the of PZase structure,"3.3 The effect of the alcohols on the of PZase structure To follow the structural change of the enzyme in the presence of alcohols, the far-UV CD and near-UV CD spectra of PZase was studied in the absence and presence of 10% (v/v) of each alcohol. The far-UVCD results showed that methanol, similar to isopropanol and n- propanol, decreased the secondary structure (α-helical and β-strand structures) of PZase (Fig. 3 A). However, ethanol has a much milder effect on the secondary structure of the enzyme (Fig. 3A). The near-UV CD results showed that the alcohols also disrupt the tertiary structure of PZase (Fig. 3B). Among the studied alcohols, the decrease in the tertiary structure of the enzyme is less in the presence of ethanol, compared to the solutions of other alcohols (Fig. 3B). These results indicated that methanol, isopropanol and n-propanol decreased the tertiary structure of PZase in a similar manner. To further examine the tertiary structure of PZase, the intrinsic fluorescence of the enzyme was investigated by exciting the enzyme at 290nm, which is a measure of the change in the position of the Trp residues in the enzyme. The results showed that the decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence of the enzyme is more in the presence of methanol, compared to other alcohols (Fig. 4 ). This means that the tertiary structure of the enzymes was significantly affected by 10% (v/v) of methanol. However, higher decreases in fluorescence intensity of the enzymes in the presence of methanol (Fig. 4) relative to isopropanol and n-propanol (which have more destabilizing effects compared to methanol) can be due to the polarity of methanol [46]."
16,The combinational effect of osmolytes and alcohols on the stability of PZase,"3.4 The combinational effect of osmolytes and alcohols on the stability of PZase It has been shown that sorbitol, sucrose and glycerol can increase the PZase stability [47]. To examine the effects of these osmolytes on the kinetic stability (or thermal irreversible denaturation) of PZase in the presence of the alcohols, the enzyme was incubated in 10% of each alcohol in the presence of 20% of sorbitol, sucrose or glycerol. As depicted in Fig. 5 and Table 2 , sorbitol, sucrose and glycerol have the highest stabilizing effects on PZase in the presence of methanol compared to other alcohols, as quantified by their effects on the relative half-life of the enzyme, (half-life in methanol plus sorbitol, sucrose or glycerol was equal to 8.5, 2.9 and 3.0, respectively). The results showed that the relative half-life of the enzyme decreases with an increase in the solvent’s log P in the presence of sorbitol and sucrose (Fig. 6 and Table 2). Mixtures of glycerol, however, did not show a similar trend: While its mixture with methanol had the highest relative half-life, in other solvents the relative half-life of the enzyme increased with increment in the solvent’s hydrophobicity (Fig. 6). It should be noted that in this experiment the relative half-life was defined as half-life of the enzyme in the presence of 10% of alcohols with 20% of osmolytes relative to the enzyme’s half-life in the presence of 10% of alcohols."
17,The detailed structural analysis of the enzyme in the presence of methanol,"3.5 The detailed structural analysis of the enzyme in the presence of methanol The results presented in section 3-2 showed that methanol, unexpectedly, decreases the thermostability of PZase more than ethanol. To better understand the structural effects of methanol on the enzyme, MD simulations were performed on the PZase structure in water and methanol (methanol and water mixture). The averages for the root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) of the Cα’s are shown in Fig. 7 as a function of the residue number. The results of our MD simulations reveal that methanol increases the average atomic RMSF of PZase from 0.10 (in water) to 0.14 (in methanol). Therefore, the RMSF per residue for the overall mobility of the residues in the methanol solution was larger than that in water. The results confirmed that the PZase structure is more flexible (or unstable) in methanol solution compared to water. Interestingly, the RMSF results showed that two regions of PZase are in particular more sensitive to the presence of methanol, as they show more of an increase in their fluctuations relative to other regions of the enzyme, in the presence of methanol compared to water (Fig. 7A). The first region (region5-40) is located between Ile 5 and Asp 40 (Fig. 7B), and the second region consists of His51 to His71 (Fig. 7B) which is known as the loop 51–71 [38]."
18,The distribution of the solvent molecules in the systems,"3.6 The distribution of the solvent molecules in the systems To study the local solvent density around PZase, the radial distribution functions (RDFs) of methanol and water molecules were calculated (Fig. 8 ).The results indicated that the distribution of the methanol molecules in the distance between 0.4 to 0.6nm is more than that of water molecules, which show that the van der Waals (VDW) interactions of the methanol molecules with PZase is more than that of water molecule (Fig. 8). Therefore, the hydrophobic interactions (or VDW interactions) between the enzyme and methanol were more than that of water molecules, which can lead to a decrease in the enzyme stability."
19,Hydrogen bond interactions,"3.7 Hydrogen bond interactions To investigate the hydrogen bonds between PZase and solvents including water and methanol, the number of hydrogen bonds was calculated in the mixture (water and methanol) during the simulation time (150ns). As shown in Fig. 9 , the hydrogen bonds of the water molecules decrease during simulation time. The number of hydrogen bonds between water molecules and PZase decrease from 289 (at starting point of simulation time) to 259 (at end of simulation time). In the case of methanol, the results indicated that the number of hydrogen bonds increase from 30 (at the starting point of simulation time) to 59 (at end of simulation time). These results showed that methanol is replaced with water molecules on hydration shell of PZase during simulation period, which can destabilize the enzyme structure."
20,Discussion,"Tuberculosis is a global health problem [48] and the activity and stability of PZase is important for the effectiveness of its treatment by PZA [32,35,38]. To study the activity and stability of PZase in more details, the alcohols methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and n-propanol were selected on the base of their log P, then the activity and the stability of the enzyme was examined. The results showed that methanol decreases the activity of PZase more than other alcohols. To study the stability of PZase in the alcohols and the alcohol/osmolyte mixtures, the kinetic stability of the enzyme was determined. The effect of alcohols (solvents) and combinatory effect of osmolytes and alcohols (or solvents) on the kinetic stability of proteins are important in the cellular condition and biotechnological applications [9,10,23,24,49]. Therefore in this study, instead of thermodynamic stability studies such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis (which is unclear issue for irreversible alterations [49]) and melting temperature (Tm) calculation, the kinetic stability of PZase (which its stability in the bacterial cell is important for tuberculosis treatment by PZA [38]) was investigated in the presence of alcohols and alcohol/osmolyte mixtures. To study the kinetic stability of PZase, the thermal irreversible denaturation (or thermostability) of the enzyme was determined. Our results indicated that alcohols decrease the thermostability of PZase. With the exception of methanol, the stability of PZase decreases with an increase in alcohols’ log P (hydrophobicity). Previous reports suggested the following ranking for the alcohols, based on their destabilizing effect on the tertiary structure of the studied proteins: trifluoroethanol (TFE)> n-propanol > ethanol > methanol [14,15,17]. In the other study, it indicated that with a rise in the alcohols (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and n-propanol) log P, their destabilization effects increase [10]. With an increase in hydrophobicity, the hydrophobic interactions between alcohols and hydrophobic regions of the protein surface increase, which derives the protein structure to an unfolded state [14,15]. Therefore, the observed increase in unfavorable hydrophobic interactions between PZase and ethanol, isopropanol, and n-propanol, lead to further denaturation of PZase as the alcohols’ hydrophobicity increases. The far-UV and near-UV CD, as well as intrinsic fluorescence studies, showed that methanol, similar to isopropanol and n-propanol, have a strong disruptive effect on the secondary and tertiary structures of PZase compared to ethanol. It has been shown that inhibition and denaturation of enzyme play a major role in reducing the enzymatic activity in the presence of solvents [50]. Therefore, according to the CD and fluorescence results, the decrease in the enzymatic activity was due to the enzyme’s denaturation in the presence of methanol. The far-UV and near-UV CD, intrinsic fluorescence and thermostability results showed that, in contrast to low log P of methanol, the destabilization effect of methanol on PZase structure is more than that of ethanol. This was an unexpected effect of methanol on the enzyme stability, and means that the hydrophobic interactions alone cannot explain the destabilizing effects of methanol on PZase (discussed below). To investigate the combinatory effect of osmolytes and alcohols on the thermostability (thermal irreversible denaturation) of PZase, sorbitol, sucrose and glycerol were selected based on their difference in the stabilization mechanism [51–53]. Our results showed that the stabilization effect of sorbitol in methanol (with relative half-life of 8.5 folds) is more than other alcohols. In addition, with an increase in the alcohol’s hydrophobicity, the stabilization effects of sorbitol decreases. Sorbitol is excluded preferentially from the non-polar residues in the denatured protein, which results in the preferential exclusion due to its polarity [51,54]. A rise in the hydrophobicity of the solvent makes it difficult for the polar sorbitol to be excluded from the exposed hydrophobic regions of the denatured protein [10]. Therefore, an increase in the stabilization effect of sorbitol coincident with a decrease in solvent’s hydrophobicity can be due to the effective preferential exclusion of sorbitol from hydrophobic regions on the denatured protein in polar solvents [10]. This is the reason why the stabilization effect of sorbitol on PZase (or the relative half-life of the enzyme in sorbitol) in the presence of methanol was more compared to other alcohols. The stabilizing effects of sucrose on PZase decreases with an increase in alcohols log P. It has been shown that sucrose raises the surface tension of solutions, thereby leading to preferential hydration of proteins and stabilizing their structures [52,54,55]. With an increase in alcohol’s hydrophobicity, the alcohol molecules which are likely to be located in the vicinity of PZase’s hydration shell, may possibly orient such that their OH groups face the shell and their hydrophobic moieties face the solvent (alcohol and water) bulk, therefore disrupting the hydrogen bonds between water molecules which are in the surface of the shell. This causes a decrease in the surface tension and therefore a decrease in the stabilization effects of sucrose on PZase in hydrophobic solvents. Glycerol had the most stabilization effect on PZase (with relative half-life of 3.0 folds) in the presence of methanol. It has been indicated that the stabilization effects of glycerol increase with an increment in alcohol’s log P [10]. Therefore, the stabilization effect of glycerol in the presence of methanol despite its low log P was unexpected. To investigate the unexpected behavior of the enzyme (the stability of PZase and more stabilization effect of glycerol on the enzyme) in the presence of methanol, the MD simulations were performed in the absence (water) and presence of methanol (mixture of methanol and water). The RMSF results showed that the flexibility of region 5–40 and loop 51–71 in PZase increases in the presence of methanol. Taken together with CD, fluorescence and thermostability results it can be suggested that methanol disrupts the tertiary structure (or stability) of PZase by increasing the flexibility of region 5–40 and loop 51–71 of the enzyme. As a result, region 5–40 and the loop 51–71 are crucial for the stability of the tertiary structure of PZase. On the other hand, Doustdaret al. previously showed that the loop 51–71 has a critical role in the activity of PZase: Among different studied mutants, MUT2 (L151S) had the highest flexibility in the loop, and also showed the lowest PZase activity [38]. Therefore, the larger decreases in the PZase activity (reported in this study) in the presence of methanol can be ascribed to an increase in the flexibility of loop 51–71 induced by this alcohol. However, further studies such as site directed mutagenesis are required to decipher the importance of region 5-40 and loop 51–71 on the activity and stability of PZase. The RDF results indicated that methanol molecules have favorable van der waals (VDW) interactions (or hydrophobic interaction) with the enzyme. Several valuable studies showed that VDW interactions are important for binding of different ligands (such as drugs) or solvents to proteins [56–60]. Shao showed that methanol molecules accumulate on protein surfaces and have favorable VDW interactions with the protein, which results in the weakening of the intra-protein non-polar interactions, leading to the full expansion of a model protein, BdpA [61]. Therefore it is perceivable that methanol also forms hydrophobic interactions with PZase, which results in the destabilization of the protein structure. Yu et al. suggested that methanol is a refolding additive since it promotes the folding of both α-helix and β-hairpin via decreasing the folding free energy barrier [16]. Therefore, one can speculate that methanol is likely to affect folding (or refolding) of proteins through hydrophobic interactions. The evaluation of the number of hydrogen bonds between PZase and mixture of water and methanol showed that methanol molecules can be replaced with water molecules on the first layer of hydration shell on PZase during simulation time. Hwang et al. showed that methanol molecules accumulate near protein surfaces and are replaced with water molecules in methanol/water solution, resulting in the destabilization of BBA5 peptide [62]. This suggest that the replacement of methanol molecules with water molecules in hydration shell of PZase can be attributed to more severe destabilizing effect of methanol on PZase. The results of this work showed that glycerol had more stabilizing effect on PZase in the presence of the polar solvent, methanol. Vagenende et al. suggested that glycerol prevents protein aggregation by an amphiphilic orientation in the hydrophobic regions on the surface of lysozyme [53]. In this situation glycerol molecules are oriented such that the C atoms contact the hydrophobic surface region of the protein and the O atoms point toward the solvent [53]. Therefore, it can be concluded that the C atoms of glycerol interact with the hydrophobic surface regions of PZase and prevent the unfavorable hydrophobic interactions between these regions and methanol, which, in turn, stabilizes the structure of the enzyme. On the other hand, the O atoms of glycerol, presumably, disrupt the hydrogen bonds between methanol and the hydration shell of PZase, which leads to more stabilization of PZase in the presence of methanol."
21,Conclusion,"Overall, this study showed that the stability of PZase decreases with increment in the hydrophobicity of all studied alcohols, except for methanol. The combinatorial effects of alcohols and osmolytes indicated that the stabilization effect of sorbitol and sucrose also decrease with an increase in alcohol’s hydrophobicity. However, except for methanol, the stabilization effect of glycerol increases with an increment in alcohol’s hydrophobicity. Therefore, the effect of methanol on the stability of PZase in the absence of osmolytes, and also in the presence of glycerol was unexpected. To better understand, the mechanism underlying this unexpected behavior, MD simulations were performed. The results showed that PZase have two regions with enhanced flexibility (region5-40 and loop 51-71) in the presence of methanol compared to water. An increase in the flexibility of region 5-40 can be the cause of the decreased stability of PZase in methanol. Moreover, the enhanced flexibility of loop 51-71in the presence of methanol is responsible for the decrease in the enzymatic activity. Finally, the results showed that in addition to the hydrophobic interactions (VDW interaction), methanol molecules can interact with PZase via hydrogen bonds. Therefore, the stronger destabilizing effect of methanol on PZase can be due to the replacement of methanol molecules with water on the enzyme’s hydration shell and also the increased stabilizing effect of glycerol on PZase can be a result of the disruption of the hydrogen bonds between methanol molecules and the shell by glycerol."
