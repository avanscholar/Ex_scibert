0,Introduction,"The demand for reliable and effective energy alternatives to fossil fuels has been increasingly rising in recent years [1]. In particular, hydrogen is recognized as a promising future energy carrier because it is clean, recyclable, and efficient. One of the critical components of H 2 energy technology is to develop a safe, economical, and sustainable way of H 2 production. Biological H 2 production (e.g., photolysis of water, light-dependent or -independent fermentative pathways) appears to be a good candidate, as it is considered the most environment-friendly means of producing H 2 [2,3]. Dark fermentation with mainly acidogenic bacteria (such as Clostridium sp.) produces H 2 while converting organic substrates into volatile fatty acids and alcohols. These soluble metabolites can be further degraded or mineralized via photo-fermentation (with, photosynthetic bacteria, such as purple nonsulfur bacteria) resulting in more H 2 production [4]. The highest theoretical H 2 yield can be achieved through combination of dark and photo- H 2 fermentation [5,6]. However, the major drawback of photo-fermentation systems is the slow H 2 production rate primarily due to slow growth of photosynthetic bacteria and poor light conversion efficiency of the photo-bio-reactors (PBR) [7]. Meanwhile, the phototrophic H 2 production is sensitively repressed by the presence of ammonia, nitrogen, and oxygen in the environment [8]. Therefore, the photo-fermentation process would most likely be a rate-limiting step when dark and photo-fermentation are combined to trigger high-yield H 2 production. Consequently, the rate of phototrophic H 2 production must be substantially improved before achieving an effective and economically feasible integrated bio- H 2 -producing system. The carbon and nitrogen substrates are usually the most critical factors affecting the kinetics of cell growth and bio-hydrogenation [7–13]. In this study, butyric acid (HBu) was used as the sole carbon source because HBu is known to be the dominant soluble metabolite of dark H 2 fermentation when carbohydrates were used as the carbon substrate [14]. Moreover, HBu had higher substrate conversion efficiency than acetate, which is the other abundant metabolite obtained from dark fermentation [15]. As the nitrogenase-driven H 2 -producing activity of photosynthetic bacteria (such as Rhodopseudomonas palustris WP3-5) is strongly inhibited by an excessive amount of NH 4 + ions [8], glutamic acid that shows minor inhibitory effects on nitrogenase activity [16] was used as the nitrogen source. Furthermore, since iron is an important cofactor for the synthesis of nitrogenase [8,17], an appropriate supply of ferric ion ( FeCl 3 ) in the medium may also play a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency of the phototrophic H 2 production. Therefore, the effect of FeCl 3 concentration on photo- H 2 production should also be identified. For a multifactor system like this work, using a single-variable (i.e., “one-factor-at-a-time”) approach for experimental design appears to be improper because the single-variable design cannot reveal the interactions between the factors, and thus the results obtained may be biased from the true optimum [18]. Therefore, in this work, a powerful and commonly adopted statistical experimental design methodology (i.e., response surface methodology; RSM) was utilized to determine the optimal medium conditions for phototrophic H 2 production. There were few reports in the literature describing the use of the RSM approach to improve the efficiency of bio-hydrogen production. Shi and Yu [19] used response surface analysis to reveal the interactive effects of cell concentration and light intensity on the performance of photo- H 2 production with Rhodopseudomonas capsulate. Mu et al. [9] applied central composite design to investigate the individual and interactive effects of pH, temperature, and substrate concentrations on anaerobic H 2 production. In this work, RSM was utilized to identify the optimal concentrations of FeCl 3 , glutamic acid, and butyric acid in the medium to enhance phototrophic H 2 production of an indigenous isolate R. palustris WP3-5. This improvement in phototrophic H 2 production would be beneficial to the development of a successful integrated dark/photo- H 2 fermentation process for high-yield H 2 production [5,6]."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganism and medium,"2.1 Microorganism and medium R. palustris WP3-5 isolated from a wastewater treatment plant located in central Taiwan [20] was used for phototrophic H 2 production. The bacterium was grown with Rhodospirillaceae medium [20] consisting of (in g/l) K 2 HPO 4 , 0.5; KH 2 PO 4 , 0.5; MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O , 0.2; NaCl, 0.4; CaCl 2 · 2 H 2 O , 0.05; yeast extract, 0.2; iron citrate solution (1.0g/l), 5ml/l; trace element solution, 1ml. The trace element solution contained (in mg/l) ZnCl 2 , 70; MnCl 2 · 4 H 2 O , 100; H 3 BO 3 , 60; CoCl 2 · 6 H 2 O , 200; CuCl 2 · 2 H 2 O , 20; NiCl 2 · 6 H 2 O , 20; NaMoO 4 · 2 H 2 O , 40; HCl (25%), 1ml/l. For preculture, the carbon source was butyric acid with an initial concentration of 2.0g/l. The cells were grown anaerobically at 32 ∘ C for 48h under illumination with tungsten filament lamps ( light intensity = ca .7000 lx ). The anaerobic condition was created by sparging the medium with argon gas. The initial pH value of the medium was adjusted to 7.1 by 0.1N NaOH."
3,Operation of PBR,"2.2 Operation of PBR The PBR was a sealed glass vessel with a working volume of 100ml (Fig. 1 ). Light source, a conventional tungsten filament lamp (100W) adjusted to ca. 10000lx, was mounted on both sides of the PBR (Fig. 1). The initial cell concentration of R. palustris WP3-5 was 0.875g/l. The batch reactors were controlled at 32°C, pH 7.1, and an agitation rate of 100rpm. A gas collecting device was used to monitor gas production (Fig. 1) and the gas volumes were calibrated to 25°C and 760mmHg. The compositions of gas products were measured with respect to time. The culture samples were also collected from the sealed glass vessel at designated time intervals to determine cell concentration, pH, and residual butyric acid concentration. The cumulative H 2 production was simulated by modified Gompertz equation (Eq. (1)) [21,22] and the kinetic parameters for photo- H 2 production were estimated via Sigma Plot 8.0 (SPSS Inc., Point Richmond, CA, USA): (1) H = H max exp - exp R max , H 2 × e H max ( λ - t ) + 1 , where H denotes cumulative H 2 production (ml), H max denotes maximum cumulative H 2 production (ml), R max denotes maximum H 2 production rate (ml/h), t denotes culture time (h), and λ denotes the lag time (h) required for the onset of H 2 evolution. The hydrogen production performance was mainly assessed by maximum cumulative H 2 production, overall H 2 production rate, and H 2 yield. The definitions of the latter two parameters are given as follows: (2) Overall H 2 production rate = Maximum cumulative H 2 production (ml) Culture time for H 2 evolution (h) · Culture volume (1) , (3) H 2 yield = Amount of H 2 produced ( mol ) Amount of substrate (acetic acid or butyric acid) consumed (mol) ."
4,Experimental design,"2.3 Experimental design To investigate the effects of butyric acid, glutamic acid, and FeCl 3 on phototrophic H 2 production, a central composite design was used for the experimental design. Twenty batch experiments were conducted (Table 1). The concentration range of butyric acid, glutamic acid, and FeCl 3 was 1000–2000g/l (central value = 1500g/l), 200–600mg/l (central value = 400mg/l), and 25–75 mg/l (central value = 50mg/l), respectively. The levels of initial butyric acid, glutamic acid, and FeCl 3 concentrations were determined by the following equation [21]: (4) X ¯ i = Xi - Xi * Δ Xi , where X ¯ i denotes the code value of the i th test variable, Xi is a value of the i th test variable, Xi * is the value of Xi at the center point of the experimental area, and Δ Xi is the step change value. The experimental design for X 1 (butyric acid), X 2 (glutamic acid), and X 3 ( FeCl 3 ) is described in Table 1 . Stepwise regression analysis was carried out by generating the second-order regression equation as follows: (5) Y = α 0 + α 1 X 1 + α 2 X 2 + α 3 X 3 + α 11 X 1 2 α 22 X 2 2 + α 33 X 3 2 + α 12 X 1 X 2 + α 13 X 1 X 3 + α 23 X 2 X 3 , where Y is the expected response value predicted from RSM; α i , α j , and α ij are the parameters estimated from the regression results. Four responses (performance index; PI) were used to assess the effectiveness of phototrophic H 2 production with R. palustris WP3-5. The four PIs were (i) the H 2 yield that represents the conversion of carbon substrate to the desired product— H 2 , (ii) maximum H 2 production rate ( R max ) that represents the intrinsic kinetics of H 2 production, (iii) overall H 2 production rate ( R overall ) that indicates overall H 2 production efficiency by taking into account the lag time, and (iv) the lag time ( λ ) required for the onset of H 2 evolution. Table 2 summarizes the results of all the H 2 production PIs with respect to different operation conditions."
5,Overlay 3-D contour surface plot,"2.4 Overlay 3-D contour surface plot Many response surface problems involve the analysis of multiple responses. In this study, the hydrogen yield ( Y H 2 ) is important and needs to be considered while analyzing the optimal conditions for the other PIs (e.g., R max , R overall , and λ ). Simultaneous consideration of two responses ( Y H 2 and the other PI) involves the process of first building an appropriate response surface model for each response ( R max , R overall , or λ ), followed by finding a set of operating conditions that could keep Y H 2 in a desired range when optimizing the other index. Overlay contour plots were often used to determine appropriate operating conditions in similar cases [19,23,24]. However, for a system involves more than two design variables (like in this study), overlaying contour plots would become awkward, since they are usually 2-D plots. To apply the contour plot in this work, a new overlay 3-D contour surface plot was developed based on the overlay 2-D contour plot [18,25]. In this new overlay contour plot, the contour surfaces were generated from the results of model simulation indicated in Eq. (5), which can be rewritten as a second-order equation: (6) α 33 X 3 2 + ( α 13 X 1 + α 3 + α 23 X 2 ) X 3 + ( α 0 + α 1 X 1 + α 2 X 2 + α 11 X 1 2 + α 22 X 2 2 + α 12 X 1 X 2 - Y ) = 0 . As a result, X 3 can be easily solved as (7) X 3 = - ( α 13 X 1 + α 3 + α 23 X 2 ) ± ( α 13 X 1 + α 3 + α 23 X 2 ) 2 - 4 α 33 ( α 0 + α 1 X 1 + α 2 X 2 + α 11 X 1 2 + α 22 X 2 2 + α 12 X 1 X 2 - Y ) 2 α 33 . Based on Eq. (7), contour surfaces can be drawn in a 3-D plot with X 1 , X 2 , and X 3 as axes. Each overlaying 3-D contour plot in our H 2 production system contained three independent variables (i.e., concentrations of butyric acid, glutamic acid, and FeCl 3 ) and three binary responses ( Y H 2 - R max , Y H 2 - R overall , and Y H 2 - λ ). The regions for the two responses could be found, while the overlay space of the two response regions is considered the optimal region."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods The cell concentration of the culture was determined regularly by an optical density measurement at a wavelength of 660nm (i.e., OD 660 ) using a spectrophotometer (model U-2001, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The OD 660 values were converted to dry cell weight concentration via proper calibration. Butyric acid concentration was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-14B, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a 15-m-long capillary column (Type no. 11052, Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA). Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 20ml/min. Detailed procedures for GC operation were described elsewhere [14,26,27]. The gas products ( H 2 and CO 2 ) were also analyzed by gas chromatography (Model 9800, China Chromatography, Taipei, Taiwan) using a thermal conductivity detector. The carrier gas was argon and the column (2.159mm in inner diameter and 4m in height) was packed with Porapak Q (China Chromatography, Taipei, Taiwan). The detailed operation procedures were also given in our recent work [14,26,27]."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Effect of medium composition on H 2 yield,"3.1 Effect of medium composition on H 2 yield The response surface analysis was conducted based on the response of H 2 yield ( Y H 2 ). The model describing the response surface of H 2 yield is as follows: (8) Y H 2 = 5.471 + 0.0575 x 1 - 0.0646 x 2 + 0.3134 x 3 + 0.0515 x 1 2 + 0.1717 x 2 2 - 0.5001 x 3 2 + 0.0825 x 1 x 2 - 0.0275 x 1 x 3 - 0.17 x 2 x 3 . The regression coefficient ( R 2 ) was 0.849. The optimal medium composition for the highest Y H 2 could not be obtained, because a saddle point occurs on the response surface of H 2 yield."
9,Effect of medium composition on maximum H 2 production rate ( R max ),"3.2 Effect of medium composition on maximum H 2 production rate ( R max ) The R max values were obtained from simulation of the experimental data with modified Gompertz equation (Eq. (1)). The near-unity R 2 values (Table 2) indicate that the modified Gompertz equation is well suited to describe the time-course profiles of phototrophic H 2 production by R. palustris WP3-5. The R max values indicated in Table 2 were used as the response values for response surface analysis. A second-order regression equation was generated for the response surface as follows: (9) R max = 22.6 + 0.17 x 1 + 4.1 x 2 + 1.7 x 3 - 0.2 x 1 2 - 2 x 2 2 - 3.4 x 3 2 + 0.3 x 1 x 2 - 0.7 x 1 x 3 - 0.2 x 2 x 3 where x 1 , x 2 , and x 3 indicates the coded value of the three test variables (concentration of butyric acid, glutamic acid, and FeCl 3 ), respectively. The regression model (Eq. (9)) fits the experimental data quite well with a high R 2 value of 0.925. The 3-D response surfaces are illustrated in Fig. 2 based on Eq. (5). The highest points in Fig. 2 indicate optimal operating condition attaining the highest R max . According to Fig. 2a, the R max significantly increased with increasing glutamic acid concentration. A similar trend was also observed in Fig. 2b. The highest R max occurred when glutamic acid concentration was between 600 and 700mg/l. These results indicate that glutamic acid is a key factor affecting R max . Moreover, inspection of the results of final cell dry weight concentration (Table 2) shows that increasing glutamic acid concentration led to a substantial increase in cell growth. Hence, the glutamic acid concentration is critical to both photo- H 2 production and cell growth. Furthermore, Fig. 2c shows that FeCl 3 concentration was also an important factor to R max , as the R max value increased as FeCl 3 concentration increased from 8.0 to 54mg/l. However, when FeCl 3 concentration exceeded 54mg/l, R max became independent of FeCl 3 concentration. Unlike glutamic acid and FeCl 3 , butyric acid concentration had little influence on the R max value (Figs. 2a and 2c). The response surface analysis shows that the medium composition leading to a predicted optimum R max value(24.9ml/h/l) was a butyric acid concentration of 1832mg/l, a glutamic acid concentration of 607mg/l, and a FeCl 3 concentration of 54mg/l (Table 3)."
10,Effect of medium composition on overall H 2 production rate ( R overall ),"3.3 Effect of medium composition on overall H 2 production rate ( R overall ) The response surface analysis was also conducted to investigate the effects of FeCl 3 , glutamic acid, and butyric acid on the overall H 2 production rate ( R overall ) . The second-order polynomial model used to describe the response surface for R overall is as follows: (10) R overall = 12.1 + 0.76 x 1 + 0.88 x 2 + 0.65 x 3 - 0.63 x 1 2 - 0.92 x 2 2 - 1.76 x 3 2 + 0.21 x 1 x 2 - 0.12 x 1 x 3 - 0.59 x 2 x 3 . The regression coefficient ( R 2 ) was 0.963, suggesting that the regression model fits the experimental data accurately. According to Eq. (10), the 3-D response surfaces were generated as shown in Fig. 3 . The highest points on the surfaces represent the optimal operating condition for R overall . As depicted in Fig. 3, the R overall increased initially with increasing the concentration of glutamic acid, butyric acid, and FeCl 3 until an optimum was reached (Figs. 3a–c). Thereafter, further increases in concentration of glutamic acid and butyric acid resulted in a slight decline in R overall , whereas the R overall decreased rapidly with increasing FeCl 3 concentration once the FeCl 3 concentration exceeded 65mg/l (Figs. 3b and c). These results indicate that the concentration of FeCl 3 , glutamic acid, and butyric acid all had a significant individual influence on R overall . Moreover, Fig. 3c shows that the reciprocal interaction between concentration of FeCl 3 and glutamic acid had a relatively higher effect on the R overall , thereby being critical to the improvement of R overall . The response surface analysis for R overall gave an optimal butyric acid, glutamic acid, and FeCl 3 concentration of 1842, 506, and 52mg/l, respectively. By fitting the second-order polynomial model (Eq. (10)), the optimal R overall value is estimated as 12.6ml/h/l. It is noticed that the optimal medium composition for R overall and R max was quite similar (Table 3), suggesting that the factor of lag time ( λ ) virtually had a minor effect on the optimal medium condition for H 2 production rates."
11,Effect of medium composition on time delay,"3.4 Effect of medium composition on time delay Using the results listed in Table 2, the second-order polynomial model generated to describe the response surface for lag time ( λ ) is as follows: (11) λ = 50.27 + 19.22 x 1 - 5.46 x 2 - 0.8 x 3 + 8.67 x 1 2 + 10.52 x 2 2 + 20.76 x 3 2 - 7.48 x 1 x 2 - 0.01 x 1 x 3 + 14.3 x 2 x 3 . Simulation of the experimental data with Eq. (11) was quite successful as the regression coefficient ( R 2 ) was as high as 0.953. The response surface is plotted in Fig. 4 , in which the lowest points present the optimal medium composition resulting in the shortest time delay. As depicted in Figs. 4a and b, the lag time increased with increasing butyric acid concentration (Figs. 4a and b), indicating that the high butyric acid concentration seemed to inhibit H 2 production, causing a longer lag time. Moreover, Figs. 4b and c show that the lag time may be shortened while using a FeCl 3 concentration of 50–60mg/l, indicating that a suitable FeCl 3 concentration would be needed to trigger the phototrophic H 2 production. Based on the response of the shortest lag time, the predicted optimum concentration for butyric acid, glutamic acid, and FeCl 3 was 891, 352, and 52mg/l, respectively, giving the shortest λ value of 39.2h by fitting the second-order polynomial model (Eq. (11)). It is noted that the minimization of λ predicted a much lower HBu concentration than that for maximizing R max and R overall (Table 3). This is quite reasonable, because by using a lower HBu concentration, the inhibitory effect of HBu on cell growth could be avoided during the early cultivation stage, thereby leading to a shorter λ . However, this compromise was at the expense of poor H 2 production rates due to a lower concentration of carbon source (Table 3). Apparently, for the purpose of optimizing H 2 -producing performance, it is not suitable to choose λ as the primary PI in the response surface analysis."
12,Overlay 3-D contour surface plot,"3.5 Overlay 3-D contour surface plot Despite that the response surface analysis on Y H 2 could not attain an optimum value, it is still desired that the operation system be kept at a high H 2 yield ( Y H 2 ) while optimizing medium composition for the highest R max and R overall , and the lowest λ . For this purpose, a new overlay 3-D contour surface plot was developed to optimize three binary responses, including Y H 2 - R max , Y H 2 - R overall , and Y H 2 - λ . As indicated in Figs. 5 a–c, the space between the two response surfaces (developed by Eq. (8)) was the high Y H 2 region. In this region, the value of Y H 2 was higher than 5.5mol H 2 / mol HBu. In Fig. 5a, the region where the spots were located was the optimal region of R max . In this region, the values of R max were higher than 24ml/h/l. From the results listed in Table 3 , the optimum point for R max was indeed located in this optimal region. Therefore, the predicted optimal medium composition for optimal R max (i.e., 1832, 607, and 54mg/l for butyric acid, glutamic acid, and FeCl 3 , respectively) also attained a high yield ( Y H 2 > 5.5 mol H 2 / mol HBu). The predicted optimal values of R max and Y H 2 are shown in Table 3. Likewise, in Fig. 5b, the region where the spots were located was the optimal region of R overall ( R overall > 12.5 ml / h / l ). The overlay space of the two response regions was the optimal region, in which the optimum point for R overall was also located (Table 3). Hence, the optimal medium composition for R overall (i.e., 1842, 506, and 52mg/l for butyric acid, glutamic acid, and FeCl 3 , respectively) could also attain a high Y H 2 . The predicted optimal values of R overall and Y H 2 are shown in Table 3. Moreover, Fig. 5c shows the region for λ < 45 h . The overlay space of two response regions was the optimal region, and from Table 3, the optimum point for λ was also located in this optimal region. Thus, the medium composition for the lowest λ (i.e., 891, 352, and 52mg/l for butyric acid, glutamic acid, and FeCl 3 , respectively) could also attain a high Y H 2 . The predicted λ and Y H 2 values are also indicated in Table 3. The foregoing results indicate that the favorable medium compositions determined by response surface analysis (Table 3) were able to attain the optimal response of R max , R overall , or λ with a reasonably high Y H 2 at the same time."
13,Confirmation of predicted optimal performance and comparison with literature,"3.6 Confirmation of predicted optimal performance and comparison with literature It is indispensable to justify whether the RSM approach could accurately identify medium conditions leading to optimal H 2 -producing performance. According to the results of surface response analysis on R max , the best combination of butyric acid, glutamic acid, and FeCl 3 concentrations were 1832, 607, and 54mg/l, respectively, giving a predicted optimal R max value of 24.9ml/h/l (Table 3). Confirmation experiments were performed using the predicted optimal medium composition and obtained an R max value of 24.7ml/h/l, which was very close to that predicted by RSM. This appears to validate the feasibility of using RSM to optimize the phototrophic H 2 production with R. palustris WP3-5. Moreover, as indicated in Table 3, the performance of phototrophic H 2 production under the optimal medium composition is compared with the reported values in the literature. It is evident that the H 2 -producing performance is in general better than most of the results obtained by comparable studies in all PIs. This, again, indicates that response surface analysis was a powerful and effective tool in enhancing the performance of phototrophic H 2 production."
14,Conclusions,"This work is a successful demonstration of using statistical experimental design methodology to obtain favorable medium composition leading to improvement of H 2 -producing performance of an indigenous photosynthetic bacterium R. palustris WP3-5. By choosing concentrations of carbon source (butyric acid), nitrogen source (glutamic acid), and essential metal ion ( FeCl 3 ) as the target factors, optimization was achieved via response surface analysis using the PI of maximum H 2 production rate ( R max ), overall H 2 production rate ( R overall ), H 2 yield ( Y H 2 ), and time delay ( λ ) . Since the response surface for H 2 yield did not exhibit an optimum value, an innovative overlay 3-D contour surface plot was developed, showing that the predicted optimal medium compositions for R max , R overall , and λ were all located in the overlay regions with the constraint of Y H 2 > 5.5 mol H 2 / mol HBu . The optimal medium composition for the highest R max was a butyric acid concentration of 1832mg/l, a glutamic acid concentration of 607mg/l, and a FeCl 3 concentration of 54mg/l, giving a R max , R overall , λ , and Y H 2 value of 24.9ml/h/l, 12.3ml/h/l, 70.1h, and 5.71mol H 2 / mol HBu, respectively. The R max predicted by response surface analysis was confirmed experimentally with a good consistency. The optimal H 2 -producing performance obtained in this study is better than that reported in the literature. Thus, the RSM approach is effective and useful in enhancing H 2 production of R. palustris WP3-5, making it more feasible to integrate dark and photo- H 2 fermentation processes for a high-yield and high-efficiency production of H 2 ."
