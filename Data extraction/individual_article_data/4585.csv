0,Introduction,"Permanent magnets based on rare-earth-transition metal (RE–TM) intermetallics have been widely applied as components of electric motors, wind power generators, electroacoustic devices, computer peripherals, medical equipment, and magneto mechanics [1–4]. The production volume of such magnets increases rapidly with the rapid growth demand of environment-friendly devices [5,6], in particular wind power stations [7], electric cars [8], aircrafts with electric propulsion [9]. A large scale of application of permanent magnets stimulates seeking for new magnetic materials [10] and studies aimed at improvement of the magnetic properties of the known ones, in particular, by their grinding to nanoscale microstructure [3,4]. According to long-term predictions [11,12], textured nanocomposites, composed of a mixture of magnetically soft and magnetically hard phase nanograins, will form a new generation of permanent magnet materials, which will possess a two-fold higher specific magnetic energy in comparison to that of the current magnets [13]. This concerns particularly nanostructured magnets and nanocomposites made by rapid cooling of liquid alloy [14,15], high energy ball milling [16–18], powder hot plastic deformation [19], electric current sintering [20] or spark plasma sintering [21,22]. It is now commonly accepted that nanostructured materials exhibit improved magnetic properties. For example, the high-energy ball dry-milling, followed by spark plasma sintering [22], permitted the synthesizing of nanocrystallized SmCo5 magnets with the coercivity reaching 4.1 T. This technological procedure allows to obtain homogeneous small-sized grains that provide effective magnetic flux pinning. Hydrogen treatment of ferromagnetic materials is a perspective method for their grinding to nanoscale microstructure since hydrogenation-disproportionation-desorption-recombination (HDDR) are the transformations, which appear in intermetallics during their interaction with hydrogen and in vacuum at high temperatures (up to 950 °C) [23]. Though the HDDR process has been known since the middle of the eighties of the 20th century, new useful features of this method have recently been found and a series of papers have been published over the recent few years. Particularly, the data on the peculiarities of hydrogen interaction with RE–TM intermetallic compounds, which must be taken into account when using hydrogen treatment, are presented in a review paper [24]. It was proposed to spread the application of the HDDR method to recycling and secondary usage of magnets from worn out devices [25–28], besides, this method is in perspective for the preparation of nanocomposites [29,30]. The combined method of hydrogen treatment, based on the HDDR process with its advantageous effect of grinding to nanoscale microstructure, justified on relations between the microstructure dispersity of disproportionated and recombined material, has recently been developed for grinding ferromagnetic alloys to nanoscale microstructure [31]. It has already been shown that the coercivity of SmCo5-based powders increases substantially as a result of HDDR treatment [32] and maximum coercivity μ 0 H C = 4.7 T for powder material is achieved by grinding the HDDR treated sample [33]. Recently, a new processing method, based on the HDDR technique, has been proposed and applied for obtaining anisotropic Nd–Fe–B/α-Fe nanocomposite powder [29]. This method was also used to obtain nanoscale sintered anisotropic Nd2Fe14B-, SmCo5-, and Sm2Co17-based magnets [34–36]. Generally, there are different methods of using hydrogen to improve the properties of magnets. It is possible to grind powder particles to microstructure and then sinter them at low temperatures or to follow the HDDR procedure described in our previous papers [34–36]. The results obtained recently on using HDDR for grinding the sintered SmCo5-based magnets to microstructure are presented in the proposed manuscript. The aim of this research is to demonstrate the great potential of the HDDR process on the improvement of magnetic properties of the Sm–Co-type magnets. Enhanced coercivity, up to 5T, of the SmCo5 sintered magnets obtained after treatment by the HDDR route is reported."
1,Sample preparation and experimental details,"A parallelepiped-shaped magnet of sintered SmCo5, with a base of 20 mm and height of 10 mm was applied as a starting material for the studies performed here. The specimen was cut by the electro-spark erosion method, as shown in Fig. 1. The HDDR technique was used for the treatment of plates with sizes ≈ 10 × 10 × 2 mm3 and parallelepipeds with sizes ≈ 1 × 1 × 2 mm3. Disproportionation was carried out by solid hydrogenation-disproportionation (HD) [37] at a temperature of 650 °C, without holding at this temperature, when hydrogen pressure reached the values up to 1.1 MPa. Recombination was carried out in a vacuum at a temperature of 850 °C without and with 1 h holding time, and at a temperature of 950 °C. The phase content of specimens was analyzed by X-ray diffraction, using DRON-2.0 with Fe-К α radiation source. The X-ray patterns for plates (≈ 10 × 10 × 2 mm3) and powders were measured after grinding a piece of the sample (≈ 1 × 1 × 2 mm3). For powders, the X-ray patterns were collected by two ways. In the first method, a measurement was carried out for the powder dispersed randomly in the sample holder. In the second method, powder particles were oriented in a magnetic field, fixed in epoxy, and then the X-ray pattern was measured. The Powder Cell program package was used for phase identification [38]. The microstructure of the alloys was investigated by an electron microscopy JSM-6490 (JEOL) scanning system equipped with an INCA ENERGY 350 column. The samples were polished with diamond paste. A mixture of nitrogen acid (2.5 and 5 vol%) and ethyl alcohol was used for etching. The material was investigated in the polished and etched states. The magnetic properties of parallelepiped- (≈ 1 × 1 × 2 mm3) or cube-shaped (2.2 × 2.2 × 2.2 mm3) samples were measured by using the Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS). The anisotropy of the HDDR-treated magnet was determined by the degree of texture (DoT), defined as (M r(‖) - M r(⊥))/M r(‖)× 100(%), where M r(‖) and M r(⊥) [22] are the remanence along the direction parallel and perpendicular to the alignment direction, respectively."

3,Phase content of starting sintered materials,"3.1 Phase content of starting sintered materials The data in Fig. 2 a reveals that the sintered magnet consists of SmCo5 phase with the CaCu5-type structure. Diffractogram recorded for the plate is shown in Fig. 2 b. The sintered material was textured and SmCo5 grains were aligned along the crystallographic c-axis, since increased 001 and 002 peaks were noticed in Fig. 2 b. Thus, the initially sintered magnets were characterized by the CaCu5-type structure (Fig. 2a) with textured grains (Fig. 2 b). A disproportionation regime was chosen in such a way that the alloy containing the SmCo5 phase remained. In such a case, the material is anisotropic after HDDR [39]. Disproportionation products; SmH2±x and Co, were revealed on the surface of the plate sample as a result of interaction of the alloy with hydrogen ( Fig. 3 a), besides, the CaCu5-type phase traces exist within the alloy (Fig. 3 b). After recombination, the SmCo5 phase was oxidized and Sm2O3 and Co were present on the plate surfaces. The sample was crushed into powder and the powder particles were oriented in magnetic field for determining the phase composition and texture within the alloy after HDDR. The ferromagnetic phase with CaCu5-type structure recombined at temperatures of 850 °С was found ( Fig. 4 a), and a part of the sample became anisotropic after 1 h holding during recombination at 850 °С (Fig. 4 b). A similar result was obtained as a result of recombination at 950 °C. The initially sintered magnet exhibited a coarse microstructure with two ferromagnetic phases SmCo5 and Sm2Co7, and the Sm-rich regions ( Fig. 5, Table 1)."
4,Magnet microstructure after recombination,"3.2 Magnet microstructure after recombination A clear demarcation of the areas of ferromagnetic SmCo5 and Sm2Co7 phases ( Fig. 6 a, Table 1), similar to that observed in the starting alloy, is a characteristic feature of the morphology of the sintered magnet after disproportionation and recombination at a temperature of 850 °C without holding. The Sm2Co7 phase exhibits a homogeneous microstructure with a grain size of 80–130 nm (Fig. 6 b). The presence of a mixture of coarse grains with a size of 180–370 nm and fine grains with a size of 70–100 nm is the characteristic feature of the SmCo5 phase. The sintered magnet after recombination at a temperature of 850 °C with 1 h holding exhibits similar morphology as that in the initial state, with similar distribution of SmCo5 and Sm2Co7 phase-constituents (Fig. 6 c). The microstructure is fine-crystalline with a grain size of 80–120 nm. The amount of the Sm2Co7 phase in the magnet decreases with increasing recombination temperature to 950 °C (Fig. 6 d, Table 1). The Sm-rich regions become coarser. The magnet microstructure remains fine-crystalline though the grain size increases to 90–170 nm."
5,Magnetic properties of the SmCo5 magnet after hydrogentreatment,"3.3 Magnetic properties of the SmCo5 magnet after hydrogentreatment The hysteresis loops of HDDR-processed sintered magnets, measured after different recombination conditions, are shown in Fig. 7. A high coercivity is found in all cases. Its magnitude (μ 0 H C) varies from 4.90 to 4.97 T. Magnetization of all samples does not reach saturation in the magnetic field up to 9 T. The remnant magnetization increases from 27.7 to 43.5 with increasing holding time at 850 °C from 0 to 1 h, and to 46.7 Am2/kg with increasing recombination temperature up to 950 °C. The hysteresis loop rectangularity varies from 77 to 74.6 and to 78.8% in the respective conditions. The magnets are anisotropic with the degree of texture equal to 13% (Fig. 7 b). The remanent magnetic moment M R of the sample with coercivity of about 5 T increases by 5% as a result of treatment in the field of 16 T in comparison with the value obtained as a result of treatment in 9 T."
6,Comparison of the obtained results with literature data,"As it was already mentioned [2–4], a formation of nanoscale structures in RE-TM type magnets is the best way to improve their magnetic properties. Hydrogen treatment by HDDR route is very promising among other nano structuralization methods. The results presented in this paper reveal an excellent effect of hydrogen treatment on magnetic properties of the sintered SmCo5 magnets, namely their coercivity. Besides, it was shown earlier that it is possible to obtain sintered [34–36] anisotropic [39] ferromagnetic materials with nanoscale microstructure [31] by the HDDR process. It means with the usage of this relatively simple in fulfillment method one can dissolve the problem of texturing of nanostructured materials and their sintering as well. However, it must be noted that the properties of the magnet treated by HDDR process depend on many parameters: phase and microstructure state of starting materials; hydrogen pressure, temperatures and reaction time during hydrogenation, disproportionation, and during desorption, recombination reactions. Here, we demonstrate promising possibilities of the HDDR on the coercivity of sintered SmCo5 type magnets. In particular, it can be seen by comparison of the data for coercivity of SmCo5 based materials - powders and sintered magnets obtained in various ways ( Table 2). Data given in the Table 2 were taken for the samples with μ 0 H c> 2 T. The result presented in this work is reaches one of the highest value of coercivity. We are convinced that coercivity will be further increased by optimizing the parameters of the HDDR. Since, the results presented here are the results of early stage only of a large research required to obtain the nanoscale anisotropic sintered RE-TM type magnets and then the nanocomposites. Below, there are some reflections on HDDR details presented in the paper: The parameters of thermal treatment of the SmCo5 alloy are determined based on the texture-development mechanism during HDDR, namely, the materials become anisotropic if the reaction of disproportionation is not completed, i.e., if the ferromagnetic phase residues remain in the material [39]. According to the X-ray diffraction data, the content of the ferromagnetic phase in the alloy after disproportionation is small. This explains why the recombined materials exhibit a partial texture only with a degree of texture equal to 13%. The recombined material texture parameter most likely depends on the quantity of ferromagnetic phase remaining after disproportionation. According to the X-ray diffraction analysis data, the disproportionated material recombines in a vacuum within the temperature range 850–950 °C [50]. The CaCu5-type structure phase is formed during recombination already at a temperature of 850 °C. It is inhomogeneous and most likely, this is because of low residual magnetization [51]. The 1 h holding during recombination at a temperature of 850 °С results in homogenization of this phase, which leads to the increase in the residual magnetization and the reaching of high coercivity. The increase of the recombination temperature up to 950 °С causes the formation of a larger quantity of the SmCo5 phase regions with simultaneous decrease of the volume occupied by the Sm2Co7 phase. As a result, the residual magnetization increases a little. However, the coercivity starts to decrease because the grain size increases. The SmCo5 type materials are very stable to oxidation in air. We revealed only small amount of Sm2O3 oxides as on surface of the sintered plates as in grinded ones into powder also. Similar results obtained for SmCo5 powders after HDDR were reported by Kubis et al. [33]. One of the reasons for such behavior may be high chemical activity of HDDR treated SmCo5 alloy caused by very fine microstructure. In the proposed and other studies, for example [33], a relatively high hydrogen pressure was applied. It is worth noting that it is possible to decrease the hydrogen pressure during HDDR [31,32,52,53]. The results of the present study confirm the perspectives of using hydrogen treatment for improvement of the permanent magnets properties and a necessity of further development of this method."
7,Conclusions,"The after-sintering treatment of the sintered SmCo5-based magnets, with the use of the hydrogenation-disproportionation-desorption-recombination (HDDR) technique, was found to be promising for reaching favorable magnetic properties. It was revealed that variation of conditions for the second stage of HDDR – desorption and recombination, in particular, variation of temperature and duration of treatment, provide significant impact on the hysteresis loop. The coercivity may reach high values for such sintered magnets. In addition, the remanence of the magnets depends on desorption and recombination conditions. It increases with increasing recombination temperature and with increasing treatment time. The sintered magnets treated by the HDDR technique are partially textured, provided that the disproportionation is carried out in the conditions appropriate for the texture-development mechanism: the materials become anisotropic, if the residues of the ferromagnetic phase remain in the material. The use of the HDDR method for the treatment of the SmCo5-based ferromagnetic alloys with the aim of obtaining a fine-grained microstructure is a perspective method for increasing the coercivity of these types of magnets. The parameters of the HDDR process must be optimized in order to obtain improved properties and after their optimization, this technique will provide a scientific and technological platform for the development of anisotropic nanocomposites."
