0,Introduction,"Acetals are important intermediates for the protection of carbonyls in multistep organic synthesis and functional additives in food and cosmetic industries and biodiesel fuels [1–3]. A large number of synthetic strategies of acetals have been explored due to their extensive applications [4–6]. The mainstream path for the production of acetals is acetalization of aldehydes/ketones with normal primary alcohols driven by heating and/or light irradiation [4,5] in the presence of strong Lewis acids or organic acids catalysts (Fig. 1 a) [6–8]. The direct oxidation reaction of alcohols over various catalysts (Fig. 1b) could only generate esters by using an excess amount of base to accelerate the protonation process and the final yields [9,10]. The selective oxidation of alcohols into aldehydes/ketones is usually essential for the following acetalization, resulting in two-step reaction paths with the help of oxidant and acid successively under harsh conditions (Fig. 1c) [11,12]. The construction of effective strategies that fulfill environment-friendly principles is a research priority for the vital application of pharmaceutical intermediates and fine chemicals industries [13–16]. From the aspect of atom efficiency, the direct and selective transformation of alcohols into acetals will largely depress the consumption of oxidant, energy, and unwanted additives and remains a great challenge for the development of a mild and green catalytic system. Electrocatalytic approaches are now recognized as a tunable and powerful alternative in synthetic chemistry via the controllable potential or current to partially replace some additives and could generate some unstable but functional compounds under mild conditions. However, non-targeted and commercial electrodes (such as platinum, carbon rod, and reticulated vitreous carbon) are usually used as the current collectors [17–19]. Moreover, the strategies for improving the transformation of substrates also involve various functional mediators, expensive ligands, and sacrificial transition metal electrodes. There is a consensus in the literature that the composition and structure of commercial electrodes could change the electrocatalytic process in various electrochemical reactions (e.g. water splitting, nitrogen reduction reactions, and carbon dioxide reduction reactions) [20–25]. However, the exploration of well-designed electrodes to boost the electrocatalytic efficiencies for organic synthesis still remains in its infancy till now. Herein, we renew the function of well-studied carbon monoliths as de novo electrode materials to change the original reaction paths of classic organic chemistry (Fig. 1a–c) into a direct coupling path of alcohols into acetals (Fig. 1d). DFT calculation and experimental results demonstrated the key role of increased nitrogen contents in pulling down the valence band of carbon monoliths and enhancing the preferred adsorption of O–H groups of benzyl alcohol molecules. An obvious polarization of pre-adsorbed O–H groups indicates its strong interaction with the carbon monolith surface for the further activation process, leading to a novel conversion path of alcohols into acetals, which is not available in classic organic reaction systems, especially for these reactions without cocatalysts and functional additives. The excellent electrochemical stability of nitrogen-doped carbon monoliths further ensures long-term cycling performance."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation,"2.1 Preparation 40 g of dicyandiamide (99.5%, Acros organics) and 1 g of d-(+)-Glucose (99.5%, Vetec) were mixed into deionized water with stirring and heating, and the mixture was evaporated to remove the solvent. The obtained dry powers were heated at elevated temperatures (900, 1000, and 1200 °C) under N2 atmosphere at 2.3 °C/min for 2 h. The samples were collected after cooling down to room temperature, and noted as NxC (x is the content ratio of N to C). 5 mg of as-obtained sample and 100 μL of Nafion solution (5 wt%, Sigma Aldrich) were dispersed into 900 μL of water/ethanol (v/v = 2:7) to form a uniform ink by sonicating. A certain amount of ink was added dropwise onto the hydrophilic treatment of carbon cloth (1 × 1 cm2, W0S1002, CeTech), and then dried at 60 °C. The loaded carbon cloth electrodes were used as working electrodes for the following electrochemical synthesis reactions. The control sample of activated carbon was got by heating carbon black at 900 °C."
3,Electrochemical measurements,"2.2 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical reactions: The electrochemical experiments were performed on an electrochemical station (CHI 660E, Shanghai CH Instruments Company) in a standard three-electrode system by using a homemade undivided cell with Ti mesh counter electrode and Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The electrochemical reactions were conducted in 20 mL of methanol (99.9%, Adamas) with benzyl alcohol (0.5 mmol, 99.8%, Aldrich), and lithium perchlorate (1 mmol, 99.99%, Aladdin) at room temperature. Methanol was not only used as the solvent, but also as the reactant. The electrocatalytic stability tests of catalysts were evaluated for five consecutive cycles. Electrochemical adsorption: The experiments were carried out in the undivided cell containing benzyl alcohol (1.5 mmol), methanol (20 mL), and lithium perchlorate (1 mmol). The adsorption experiment was performed at 1.8 V versus Ag/AgCl for 2 min before the transformation of benzyl alcohol. The residual volume of benzyl alcohol in solution was extracted and analyzed on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS, Shimadzu QP2010SE) with dodecane as the internal standard. And the adsorption volume for benzyl alcohol (Cads) was calculated using the equation of nads = nini − nres (nini and nres represent the initial and residual contents, respectively)."
4,Products analysis,"2.3 Products analysis After the reaction, a mixed solution containing 500 μL of the solution, 500 μL of deionized water, 500 μL of dichloromethane, and 0.2 μL of dodecane was extracted and then dried by anhydrous sodium sulfate. The extracted solution was analyzed in GC–MS to determine the components of the products. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) was calculated as follow: FE = Ni × n × F/Q, where Ni is the number of moles for the specific product (mole); n is the number of electrons exchanged for product formation, which is 2 e in this reaction; F is the Faradaic constant of 96,487 C/mol; Q is the passed charge."
5,Characterizations,"2.4 Characterizations Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out on FEI Nova NanoSEM 450 field emission scanning electron microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis were conducted on a JEM-2100F microscope with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded at an ESCALAB 250 photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer, respectively. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) measurements were conducted on an Avio 200 spectrometer for metal elements detection."
6,Theoretical calculation,"2.5 Theoretical calculation The DMol3 program on Materials Studio was performed by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations with generalized gradient approximation method with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional (GGA-PBE) [26,27]. The double numerical plus polarization (DNP) basis set was employed and described the valence orbitals of the atoms and the DFT Semi-core Pseudopots method was adopted for core treatment [28]. The 5 × 5 supercells with 12.3 × 12.3 Å and 120° were used as a typical model, and 15 Å of vacuum layer thickness was set to avoid the interactions graphene layers. The k-piont integration was sampled using a 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack grid. The contents and types of nitrogen in the graphene lattice were estimated according to the XPS elements analysis results. The adsorption energy (E ads) was calculated using the following equation: E ads = E BA+catalyst − E BA − E catalyst, where E ads is the adsorption energy and E BA+catalyst, E BA, and E catalyst are the energies of the absorbed benzyl alcohol on the catalyst, benzyl alcohol molecule, and catalyst, respectively."
7,Results and discussion,"In order to fabricate large-area electrodes for real uses in electrolyzer, we firstly prepared carbon monoliths materials via a modified nanoconfinement method from a mixture of dicyandiamide and glucose (Fig. S1) [29–31]. The as-prepared monolith samples were directly dispersed into carbon cloth (Fig. 2 a), named as NxC with the same catalyst loadings but varied N/C ratios (x: 0.02, 0.05, and 0.13, Table S1). Indeed, the as-deposited carbon monoliths could maintain their hierarchical structure (Figs. 2b and S2, S3) after coating on carbon cloths. The primary subunits of carbon monolith materials were nitrogen-doped graphene layers with a homogeneous distribution of nitrogen atoms along with the whole sample (Fig. 2c). There was only a slight increase in the numbers of defects with more nitrogen dopants according to the similar ID/IG values from Raman spectra (Fig. 2d). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Fig. 2e) further confirmed the presence of nitrogen dopants mainly in the form of pyridinic N and graphitic N (Fig. 2f). DFT calculation results of NxC models (Figs. 2g and S4) with the same N contents according to the XPS analysis results indicated that the introduction of more nitrogen atoms could gradually open the bandgap of the carbon framework [32]. Indeed, the enlarged bandgap was further validated by the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) plots of NxC samples (Fig. 2h) with slightly enlarged high-frequency semicircles and thus relatively lower electronic conductivity induced by nitrogen doping. Simultaneously, the valence bands of NxC samples were pulled down (Fig. 2g), boosting their oxidation power for possible catalytic reactions. Inspired by the success in tuning the electronic structures of carbon monoliths, we initially tested the possibility of electrochemical transformation benzyl alcohol and methanol to benzaldehyde dimetyl acetal on NxC electrodes in a home-made electrolyzer (Fig. S5) only using lithium perchlorate as the electrolyte. Electrochemical reactions could not proceed without applying a working voltage, indicating a stable system without any reaction between the reactants and electrolyte/electrodes (Fig. S6). Enhanced current density could be offered by N0.13C anode at relatively lower potentials as compared to that of bare carbon cloth electrode (Fig. 3 a), rather speaking for the activity of our N0.13C anode toward the electrochemical transformation of alcohols. Indeed, benzyl alcohol and methanol could be completely coupled into benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal by N0.13C anode with an optimized catalyst loading of 0.5 mg/cm2 (Fig. S6b) at 1.8 V versus Ag/AgCl under ambient conditions in 48 h (Figs. 3b and S7) with high selectivity (70–99%) along with the whole reaction. The N0.13C anode could give a yield of up to 17.1% within 3 h independent on the cathode materials (Fig. S8), including Ti mesh, Pt mesh, and C rod. As control anodes, highly conductive bare carbon cloth and nitrogen-free activated carbon electrodes (Fig. 3c) could only provide yields of acetal to be 2.1 and 4.8%, respectively. All these results demonstrate the key role of NxC anode in boosting the electrocatalytic coupling of benzyl alcohol with methanol. Unlike the conventional two-step conversion of alcohols to acetals via an oxidation reaction to give aldehydes/ketones using various oxidants followed by an acid-catalyzed acetalization reaction, our technique on the basis of well-designed NxC anodes exhibits a very high atomic economy without consuming any oxidant or acid. The fact that the N0.13C anode could provide a reproducible activity for acetal production in either air or Ar atmosphere (N0.13C* of Fig. 3c) directly exclude the involvement of oxygen gas in the electrocatalysis process. However, the formation of benzaldehyde accompanies the whole reaction till complete conversion to benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal (Fig. 3d). A trace amount of formaldehyde (4.6 μmol) was also detected (Fig. S9a), again demonstrating the key role of NxC anodes in the dehydrogenation of alcohols. Methanol was disassociated into methoxy radicals [33] on the anode as proved by the quenching reaction using butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) (N0.13C** of Figs. 4 c and S9b) with the as-formed protons reduced to hydrogen gas on the cathode (Fig. S9c). We also carefully analyze the metal-free feature of NxC catalysts because even a trace amount of metal might change the catalytic performance of various electrodes for specific reactions [34–36]. The preparation process was carefully controlled by using high-purity reagents and high-quality corundum crucible to avoid introducing metal species. Only carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen elements were detected in the prepared NxC samples according to the XPS (Fig. S10) and inductivity coupled plasma (ICP, data not shown) analysis results, indicating the metal-free nature of NxC. Moreover, the nitrogen-free carbon sample calcined by the same conditions with NxC samples could only give a much lower yield (4.8%), which further indicates the negligible contribution of unknown metal-containing impurity, if there is some, to the final catalytic performance, again speaking for the key role of NxC carbon monoliths as highly active species in our electrocatalytic system. In order to glean the real role of metal-free NxC materials in the coupling reaction, we firstly investigated the interaction between benzyl alcohol molecule and carbon surface by theoretical calculations. The similar geometries of pre-adsorbed benzyl alcohol molecules on typical NxC models (Figs. 4a–c and S11), independent on the dopant concentrations, show preferred adsorption of O–H groups to the holey defects of carbon matrix, indicating the roles of defects as active sites for coupling reaction of alcohols. However, increasing the nitrogen contents could make more electrons flow from O–H groups to defects according to the electron density difference stereograms, even though nitrogen dopants are usually considered as electron-rich heteroatoms in the carbon matrix [37,38]. This phenomenon confirms the key contribution of the lowered valence band of NxC models, rather than the nitrogen atoms themselves, to the polarization of O–H groups, benefitting the capture of benzyl alcohol molecules as further confirmed by the calculated adsorption energies with a trend of N0.13C > N0.05C > N0.02C (Fig. 4d). The enhanced adsorption volumes (Fig. 4e) of benzyl alcohol molecules on the NxC anodes under a fixed working potential further validate experimentally their strong interaction with alcohol molecules, benefitting the activation process and even triggering a novel conversion path of alcohols to acetals [39,40]. Indeed, the even lowered valence bands of NxC catalysts gradually promoted the yields for acetals under fixed conditions (Fig. 5 a) and also boosted the Faradaic efficiencies (Figs. 5b and S12) for the electrocatalytic conversion of benzaldehyde dimethyl acetals from 32% via 48% to 71% for N0.02C, N0.05C, and N0.13C anodes, respectively. It should be noted that all NxC materials with similar surface areas [29] and nanostructures (Fig. S3) exhibit comparable mass diffusion efficiencies, as also reflected by the similar slopes of their EIS plots (Fig. 2h) at a low frequency. Even with a relatively higher resistance unwanted for electrocatalysis, the N0.13C anode still acted as the best-in-class one among all NxC electrodes and was used for all following reactions. The reusability of the N0.13C anode is important for real uses in a sustainable way. A slight decrease in the current density of the N0.13C anode at the same working potential in the first circle of reuse is reasonable due to the strong adsorption of reactants from the anode surface, resulting in a slight decrease in the yield of the target product from 17.1% to 14.1% and thus a carbon balance of 93%. Nevertheless, the structure (Fig. S13) of the N0.13C material was maintained well after uses, ensuring the reproducible yields of acetals and very high carbon balance (>98%) in the following 4 runs of recycling reactions (Fig. 5c, d). As an effective and durable metal-free electrode, the N0.13C anode also provided satisfying reactivity for the electrochemical transformation of aromatic alcohols with various functional groups and different aliphatic alcohols (Table S2). In combination the control reactions (Fig. 3c) with the general activity for direct coupling reaction of various substrates, we demonstrated the key importance of well-designed NxC electrodes in capturing and activating the O–H groups of benzyl alcohols (exemplified with benzyl alcohol molecules) without the help of any scarifying additive, and heterogeneously catalyzing the tandem dehydrogenation and acetalization of alcohols into acetal via a new coupling path of alcohols (Fig. 5e). The NxC anodes accelerate the cascade conversion of benzyl alcohol via benzaldehyde to benzaldehyde dimetyl acetal. As a result, the nitrogen-rich NxC anodes could also increase the selectivity to benzaldehyde dimetyl acetal by depressing the residue of benzaldehyde during the reaction progress at the earlier stage and achieve complete conversion."
8,Conclusion,"In conclusion, we have demonstrated the de novo function of carbon monoliths with programmable valence bands as metal-free anode materials for boosting a new synthetic path of acetals from the direct coupling of alcohols. Without the assistance of mediators or organic ligands that are widely used in homogeneous electrochemical systems, we successfully control the reaction path and the efficiency by tuning the valence bands of carbon monoliths to strengthen the pre-adsorption and polarization of benzyl alcohol on anodes, which is durable and reusable for real-life reactors. The effective strategy might be applied to other important reactions, such as carbon dioxide reduction or C–H activation reactions, to create novel tandem reaction paths for the production of high value-added compounds."
