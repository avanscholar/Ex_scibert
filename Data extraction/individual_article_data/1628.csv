0,Introduction,"Electrochemical transformation has offered a tunable and efficient alternative in synthetic chemistry due to its precise control offered by the external potential or current [1–3]. Among these transformations, electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) utilizes chemisorbed hydrogen (Hads), which is electrochemically generated via proton or water reduction, to reduce multifunctional chemicals under ambient conditions [4,5]. It avoids the difficult activation of low-soluble H2 in solvents, and thereby the elevated pressure and temperature that are usually desired in thermocatalysis [6,7]. Moreover, the cathodic ECH can be paired with anode oxidation of organics in a single electrochemical cell, leading to a theoretical maximum electron efficiency of 200% [8–10]. In addition, it provides a direct conversion of “waste electricity” that is generated from solar, wind, etc., into easy-to-store and value-added chemicals [7,11], thus getting rid of the risk to store and transport gaseous H2. Recently, the ECH of biomass-derived oxygenates, such as aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, and phenols [12–15], has received progressively increasing attention, owing to the effective electro-refinement toward valuable platform chemicals under room temperature and atmospheric pressure condition without using H2 gas or consuming any organic hydrogen donors [16]. For example, carbonyl can be electrocatalytically hydrogenated with two Hads to produce alcohols, or with four Hads to form alkyls [17,18]. However, the competition with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) that consumes Hads unfortunately reduces the Faradaic efficiency of ECH [19]. Electrocatalysts that afford active and selective ECH but prohibit HER are highly desirable [20,21]. Precious metals (e.g., Pt, Pd, Ag, etc.) deliver the active ECH of carbonyl with low onset overpotential [19,22]; however, suffer from poor Faradaic efficiency, high cost, and low earth-abundance. For example, Ag surface can chemisorb and activate the carbonyl group of 5–hydroxymethylfurfural that is then reduced by Hads at −1.1 to −1.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl [23], showing high Faradaic efficiency and selectivity toward 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan. Nonetheless, the HER competes with the ECH, leading to a drastic decrease in its efficiency and selectivity at a more negative potential (≤−1.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl) due to the poor binding energy of Hads on Ag. Thus, development of efficient, high-performance, and non-precious electrocatalysts is urgently demanded. Layered transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), conventionally used for thermocatalytic hydrogenation (e.g., hydrodesulfurization and hydrodenitrification) [24], have attracted significant research interest. In general, MoS2 features its adjustable physiochemical properties after interlayer swelling/exfoliation or surface modification [25–29], giving the useful possibility of optimizing intermediate chemisorption and kinetics during ECH. For instance, it is expected that the consequently strengthened surface chemisorption can stabilize Hads toward hydrogenation rather than self-recombination to gaseous H2 [30]. Furthermore, it can effectively activate unsaturated bonds (e.g., CO), enabling a rapid elementary step on catalyst surface. Moreover, surface hydrophobicity benefits the adsorption of hydrophobic substrates from aqueous electrolytes, surmounting the limitation offered by mass diffusion [31]. However, till date, TMDs have been rarely investigated for ECH, because they are currently believed to be active for the competitive HER [32]. Herein, in situ intercalation of ammonium or alkyl-amine (dimethylamine (DMA), diethylamine (DEA), or dipropylamine (DPA)) during MoS2 synthesis was introduced to engineer its interlayers, accomplishing benchmarking ECH in an aqueous system. Noteworthy, intercalated MoS2 obviously expands the (002) d-spacing from 6.15 to 9.40–10.14 Å relying on the size of intercalants, and more importantly enables effective electronic modulation and hydrophobicity enhancement along with phase transition (2H → 1T). The one intercalated by DMA (MoS2-DMA) afforded the efficient ECH of furfural (FAL) to furfuryl alcohol (FOL) with high Faradaic efficiency of 86.3%–73.3% and selectivity of >95% at −0.25 to −0.65 V (vs. RHE), outperforming non-intercalated MoS2 and other conventional metals (e.g., Pt, Pd, Ag, etc.). The activity dependence on interlayer intercalation was ascribed to the ameliorated surface bindings and hydrophobicity. The bindings of Hads and FALads, synchronously strengthened on the edge-sites of MoS2-DMA, accelerated the surface elementary step via Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism. Moreover, the improved hydrophobicity promotes FAL affinity to overcome diffusion limitation."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation To synthesize MoS2-DMA, ammonium heptamolybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 0.35 g) and thiourea (1.82 g, molar S/Mo = 12.0) were dissolved in a solvent mixture containing N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 1.7 mL) and H2O (8.3 mL), and then the contents were heated at 240 °C for 3 h in a teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The as-obtained precipitate was thoroughly washed with water and ethanol, and then dried at 50 °C under vacuum. Similarly, MoS2-DEA and MoS2-DPA were fabricated following the similar method but by replacing DMF with N,N-diethylformamide (DEF), and N,N-dipropylformamide (DPF), respectively. To prepare MoS2 and ammonium-intercalated MoS2 (MoS2-A), H2O (10 mL) was adopted as the solvent. When the reaction was carried out for a short time MoS2-A was produced as an intermediate product, and non-expanded MoS2 was obtained when the reaction time was extended to 12 h."
3,Physical measurements,"2.2 Physical measurements X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were taken on a ZEISS ULTRA55 and JEOL 2100F, respectively. Aberration-corrected TEM (AC-TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) were performed on JEOL JEM-ARM 200F. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on Thermo scientific (Escalab 250Xi), using C 1s (284.6 eV) as a reference. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) experiment was conducted on the 1W1B beamline at Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The electron beam energy was 2.5 GeV. Thermogravimetric-mass (TG-MS) analysis was collected on the TG/DTA-MS (Q600) equipped with mass detector (GSD 301T2). The N and C contents in the samples were determined by CHN elemental analysis on a Vario EL Elementar. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were collected on a Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer. 1H NMR analysis was conducted on a Bruker 300 MHz spectrometer (DRX300). Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was performed on Agilent 6120 LC-MS. Electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were measured using a Bruker A300-10/12 electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer."
4,Electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical measurements MoS2-based materials were loaded onto a piece of carbon cloth (CC, 1 cm × 2 cm) that has been pre-treated by HNO3. A 30 mg of catalysts, 270 μL of 5% PVDF and 40 μL of 5% Nafion were dispersed in 1 mL of water–ethanol ( V H 2 O / V EtOH =4), and then sonicated for 30 min to obtain a homogeneous ink. 120 μL of the ink was carefully dropped on the CC, and naturally dried overnight. Electrochemical tests employing a H-type electrolytic cell with a Nafion membrane (Nafion 117, Sigma-Aldrich) separator were conducted on a CHI 650E electrochemical workstation. A piece of MoS2-loaded CC, a graphite rod and a Ag/AgCl (3 mol/L KCl) electrode were the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. The cathodic and anodic electrolyte was 40 mL Na2B4O7 solution (pH 9.18) containing 0.035 mol/L of FAL. Before test, the electrolyte was degassed by a flow of N2 for 30 min. Chronoamperometry measurements were operated at different applied potentials (−0.25 to − 0.65 V vs. RHE). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was conducted in 40 mL Na2B4O7 solution (pH 9.18) without and with 0.035 mol/L of FAL. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured with 10 mV amplitude over a frequency range of 10000–1 Hz at a fixed applied potential."
5,Product analysis,"2.4 Product analysis Products can be qualitatively analyzed by LC-MS (Agilent 6120) in a positive ion mode. Quantitative analysis of H2 and products were measured by gas chromatography (GC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), respectively. The H2 gas produced in the cathode chamber is directly vented into the gas sampling loop of GC (FULI 9790) at every ten minutes. The Faradaic efficiency of the H2 was calculated using the following equations (Eqs. (1) and (2)): (1) n H 2 ( m o l ) = ( α × f l o w r a t e × t o t a l r e a c t i o n t i m e ) / 1000 22.4 , (2) F E H 2 % = n H 2 × z × F t o t a l c h a r g e p a s s e d × 100 % , where, α is the volume fraction of H2 determined by GC, n H 2 is amount of substance of H2, and F is the Faraday’s constant (F = 96,485 C/mol), z is the number of transferred electrons. For H2, z = 2. Liquid products were collected from the cathode chamber and analyzed by HPLC (SHIMADZU LC-20AT) equipped with a UV detector at 216 and 240 nm. The column (INERTSUSTAIN C18) was operated at 40 °C with a binary gradient method containing H2O and CH3OH at a flow rate of 0.8 mL min−1. The CH3OH fraction is 20%. The conversion (%) of FAL, the efficiency (%) of hydrogenation products and selectivity (%) were calculated based on the following equations (Eqs. (3)−(5)): (3) Co n v e r s i o n % = m o l e o f s u b s t r a t e c o n s u m e d m o l e o f i n i t i a l s u b s t r a t e × 100 % , (4) F E % = m o l e o f p r o d u c t × z × F t o t a l c h a r g e p a s s e d × 100 % , (5) Se l e c t i v i t y % = m o le o f p r o d u c t m o le of F O L + m o le o f h y d r o f u r o i n × 100 % . In order to quantify the hydrofurin after ECH, we synthesized hydrofuroin according to the previous report [33], and then subjected it to HPLC to obtain a quantitative calibration curve. The hydrofuroin was reduced from 1,2-di(furan-2-yl)ethane-1,2-dione by NaBH4 in the presence of MoCl5. The obtained mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2 and dried in vacuum. It was further refined using an HPLC (Shanghai Xuancheng, LC3000) equipped with column (COSMOSIL, C18-MS-II), and reconstituted in acetonitrile‑d 3 (99.8 at.%,) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%) for 1HNMR analysis (Fig. S1 online). DMSO was the internal standard to determine the hydrofuran content. The hydrofuroin was then subjected to HPLC for quantitative calibration that was used to quantify the hydrofuran in ECH."
6,Theoretical calculation,"2.5 Theoretical calculation Generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was used for the exchange–correlation energy. The kinetic energy cutoff for the plane-waves expansion was 400 eV. The self-consistent field (SCF) tolerance was 1 × 10−6 eV. The Brillouin zone was sampled by 3 × 3 × 1 k-points. The MoS2 (6.15 Å) crystal adopted a trigonal prismatic MoS6, and the MoS2-A (9.40 Å) and MoS2-DMA (9.80 Å) took a MoS6 octahedral coordination, using a 2 × 2 × 1 super-cell with ammonia or dimethylamine in interlayers. A vacuum thickness of 12 Å was chosen to simulate the surface properties. The hydrogen binding energy (ΔE H) could be used to describe the stability of chemisorbed hydrogen, which was obtained according to the following equation: (6) Δ E H = 1 n ( E surf + n H - E surf - n 2 E H 2 ) , where, n is the number of H atoms in the calculation. The furfural binding energy (ΔE FAL) was obtained according to the following equation: (7) Δ E F A L = E s u r f + F A L - E s u r f - E F A L , which was taken by vertical adsorption configuration."
7,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 a exhibits the schematic illustration of a one-pot hydrothermal process introduced to fabricate MoS2 with varied interlayer structures. The reaction between heptamolybdate and excessive thiourea (molar S/Mo = 12.0) at 240 ℃ for 3 h resulted in NH4 +-intercalated MoS2-A that obviously expanded its interlayer d-spacing to 9.40 Å. As reaction time was prolonged to 12 h to eliminate NH4 + intercalation, typical MoS2 with non-expanded interlayers was received. When the solvent consisted of a mixture of DMF and H2O (V DMF/V H2 O = 0.2), hydrolysis-derived DMA+ cations served as the intercalant to achieve MoS2-DMA with a further expansion in the spacing to 9.80 Å. Via switching DMF to DEF and DPF, counterparts intercalated by DEA+ (MoS2-DEA) and DPA+ (MoS2-DPA) could be obtained, respectively. Fig. 1b depicts their XRD patterns aligned with standard Si. MoS2 presents the pattern of a 2H phase (ICDD No. 03-065-7025), with the characteristic (002) peak at 2θ = 14.36° (d 002 = 6.15 Å). In contrast, MoS2-A and MoS2-DMA show the shifted peaks to 2θ = 9.39° and 9.05°, respectively, corresponding to the expanded d-spacing of 9.40 and 9.80 Å. The well-retained (010) and (110) planes, as well as the disappearing (013), indicate the expanded lattice along c axis, but negligible in ab plane [34]. Such structures were confirmed by TEM (Fig. 1c–e). MoS2, MoS2-A, and MoS2-DMA show the (002) d-spacing of 0.62, 0.94, and 0.98 nm on curled-up edges, respectively, but the (010) plane remains the same on flat-lying nanosheets. Moreover, flower-like morphology consisting of nanosheets was observed in all the three samples by SEM (insets of Fig. 1c–e) and TEM (Fig. S2 online). Controlled experiments were carried out with a low thiourea feeding (molar S/Mo = 2.0), consistent with MoS2 formula. NH4 + was derived from both ammonium heptamolybdate and thiourea, and the feeding NH4 +/Mo ratio herein was only 4.9 and obviously lower than that for preparing MoS2-A (24.9). This could rule out the impact due to excessive NH4 +. As a result, non-expanded 2H-MoS2 was obtained after carrying out the reaction for 3 h (Fig. 2 a). When additional NH4Cl (NH4Cl/Mo = 33.0) was introduced, the diffraction peak corresponding to expanded (002) emerged at 2θ = 9.39° (d = 9.40 Å). It further moved to 2θ = 9.05° in presence of (CH3)2NH2Cl ((CH3)2NH2Cl/Mo = 33.0), which is consistent with the larger d-spacing (9.80 Å) of MoS2-DMA. Apparently, the intercalation of NH4 + and DMA+ accounts for the expanded interlayers in MoS2-A and MoS2-DMA, respectively. Accordingly, the presence of NH4 + and DMA+ intercalants was confirmed by FTIR and TG-MS analysis (Figs. S3 and S4 online). The former shows the characteristic bands associated with NH4 + and DMA+, and the latter detects NH3 and DMA released from MoS2-A and MoS2-DMA upon heating, respectively. According to elemental analysis, N content was negligible in MoS2, but it obviously increased to 2.2% in MoS2-A (Fig. S5 online), as a result of NH4 + intercalation. In MoS2-DMA, it remained at a similar level (2.1%); however, C content drastically increased to 5.4%, owing to the intercalating DMA+ with two methyl groups. The molar ratios of S/N close to 8.0 were determined on MoS2-A and MoS2-DMA, indicating a 2 × 2 × 1 MoS2 super cell intercalated by two NH4 + or DMA+. Furthermore, the size of intercalants was taken into account. Regarding the thermodynamically favoured configurations (Fig. 2c), NH4 + and DMA+ possess a size of 1.47 Å (H) × 1.64 Å (L) and 1.82 Å (H) × 4.14 Å (L), respectively. The difference between the (002) d-spacing of MoS2-DMA and MoS2-A is only 0.40 Å, obviously smaller than that between the lengths of NH4 + and DMA+ (2.50 Å). When DMA+ was replaced, respectively, by DEA+ and DPA+ with longer carbon chains but slightly increased heights (2.03 and 2.10 Å), only tiny shifts to lower degrees were observed for the (002) peaks corresponding to the d-spacing of 10.01 and 10.14 Å (Fig. 2b), respectively. As indicated, DMA+, DEA+, and DPA+ adopted a similar intercalation to pose carbon chains parallel to the monolayers of MoS2 (Fig. 2c). It was assumed that the two layers of cations intercalated into MoS2, leading to the simulated (002) d-spacing quite close to the experimental value (Fig. S6 online). Regarding the hydrophobic carbon chains, alkyl-amine intercalation into MoS2 was expected to enhance the surface hydrophobicity. The results of water contact angle (CA) test (Fig. 2d) revealed that the values on MoS2 and MoS2-A were 26° and 36°, respectively, indicating that wetting of the surface was very favourable. After introducing alkyl functional groups, water formed distinct droplets and the CAs on MoS2-DMA, MoS2-DEA and MoS2-DPA increased to 60°, 72° and 85°, respectively. As defined [35], a water CA of 65° is the boundary between intrinsic hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity on the basis of differences in the structure of interfacial water. Obviously, MoS2-DMA, MoS2-DEA and MoS2-DPA turned hydrophobic compared to MoS2 and MoS2-A. As typical TMDs, MoS2 affords phase transition (2H → 1T) sensitive to its expandable interlayers [36–38]. The MoS2, MoS2-A, and MoS2-DMA samples were analyzed by EXAFS (Fig. S7 online), and the FT fitting curves of Mo K-edge are displayed in Fig. 3 a. Clearly, MoS2 is characterized by two main peaks at 2.40 and 3.16 Å, corresponding to the nearest Mo–S and Mo–Mo distances in the trigonal prismatic MoS6 of 2H-MoS2 [39], respectively. In contrast, the Mo–Mo distance visibly shifts to 2.76 Å for MoS2-A and MoS2-DMA, consistent with the observation on intercalated 1T-MoS2 consisting of distorted MoS6 octahedral coordination [39]. Phase transition was further evidenced by XPS. The core-level Mo 3d profiles (Fig. 3b) show the peaks assigned to the Mo 3d5/2 (228.5–229.0 eV) and 3d3/2 (231.6–232.1 eV) of Mo4+ in MoS2, and that to the S 2s (226.3 eV) [40]. Further deconvolution identified the gradually improved 1T species and the reduced 2H, when interlayer expanded. The proportion of 1T species in MoS2, MoS2-A, and MoS2-DMA was quantified to be 23.5%, 48.6%, and 70.5%, respectively. The accordant variation was observed in the S 2p profiles (Fig. 3c), confirming the phase transition from 2H to 1T along with interlayer expansion. Similar phase transition was previously evidenced when 2H-MoS2 swelled to an expandable interlayer spacing (6.04–10.21 Å), relying on intercalant sizes [37,40]. Herein, the intercalating NH4 + and DMA+ weakened the coupling of adjacent atomic MoS2 layers, and consequently acted as the driving force for the phase alteration [36]. The formation of 1T phase was confirmed by AC-TEM. Octahedral 1T phase is visible on a single MoS2-DMA nanosheet, along with the trigonal prismatic 2H configuration (Fig. 2d). The HAADF-STEM image further shows the zigzag chain lattice of Mo–Mo bond in 1T phase (Fig. S8 online), in which the distance between the nearest two Mo atoms agrees with the EXAFS results. Moreover, EDS analysis confirmed the presence of Mo, S, N, and C elements (Fig. S9 online), and the corresponding elemental mapping (Fig. 3e) revealed their uniform distribution throughout the nanosheet. Noteworthy, MoS2-DMA presents observable crystalline defects (Fig. S10 online) that are ascribed to sulfur coordinated defects according to EPR (Fig. S11 online) [41,42], and are possibly active for ECH applications [43]. In order to investigate electrocatalytic performance, the ECH of FAL was conducted in a gas-tight two-compartment electrochemical cell equipped with a piece of proton exchange membrane (Nafion 117) as the separator. A buffer of Na2B4O7 (0.05 mol L−1, pH 9.18) was adopted as the electrolyte. First, the performance with or without FAL (Fig. 4 a–c) was compared. In the polarization curves, both MoS2 and MoS2-A exhibit decreasing current after introducing FAL, as well as increasing charge-transfer resistant in EIS, which indicates the disfavored ECH of FAL compared to HER. In sharp contrast, MoS2-DMA delivers the improved current and accordingly the reduced resistant in presence of FAL, indicating the occurrence of favorable ECH. Afterwards, the ECH was operated at various fixed potentials (−0.25 to −0.65 V vs. RHE) for 2 h, which produces target FOL via hydrogenating FAL with two Hads, and H2 by-product via HER. The formation of very limited hydrofuroin indicates the electrocatalytic reduction by Hads, rather than via radical processes. As depicted in Fig. 4d, MoS2 delivers FOL Faradaic efficiency of only 43.8% at −0.25 V, and H2 is the dominant product. Increasing efficiency of 60.7% is achieved on MoS2-A to produce FOL; nonetheless, HER is still obvious. In sharp comparison, MoS2-DMA affords the obviously improved efficiency for FOL (86.3%) and the depressed one for H2 (9.4%) under the same condition. The promoted ECH on MoS2-DMA was found to be remarkable in a wide potential range of −0.25 to −0.65 V, reaching the high efficiency exceeding 73.3%. Accordingly, MoS2-DMA delivers a climbing FAL conversion with increasing potentials, always higher than those of MoS2-A and MoS2 (Fig. 4e). Moreover, the FOL selectivity is maintained at >95%, highlighting an efficient hydrogenation to target alcohols. A further comparison among MoS2-DMA, MoS2-DEA, and MoS2-DPA was evaluated at −0.25 V (Fig. 4f). The latter two possessed the same flower-like nanostructures with MoS2-DMA (Fig. S12 online), but the prolonged carbon chains of intercalating alkyl-amines. They afforded decreasing conversion and efficiency. It is supposed that the long carbon chains in DEA+ and DPA+ cover part of active sites, and the highly hydrophobic surface prohibits water wetting and reduction that produces Hads for subsequent ECH. In further comparison with metal catalysts such as Pt, Pd, Ag, Cu, and Ni, MoS2-DMA featured the higher Faradaic efficiency and selectivity toward FOL. Although previous study reported higher FOL efficiency (>90%) on Ni2P and Cu3P [30], debate was still remained because strong alkali (1.0 mol L−1 KOH) that would easily cause the Cannizzaro disproportionation reaction of FAL was adopted. The pH effect of electrolytes on the ECH of FAL was then examined (Fig. S13 online). It turns out that MoS2-DMA exhibits the best performance at pH 9.18. The FOL efficiency remains stable at around 80% at pH 6.5 and 10.5; however, the FAL conversion declines visibly. A strong acidic condition (e.g., 0.5 mol L−1 H2SO4) disfavours the ECH owing to easy H+ reduction to H2; while a strong alkaline solution (e.g., 1.0 mol L−1 KOH) causes the disproportionation of FAL to furanic acid and FOL even without applied potential. Moreover, a recycle test (Fig. S14 online) revealed the robust service-life of MoS2-DMA, with high Faradaic efficiency (75%–80%) after four successive cycles. In each test for 2 h, the current only drops slightly, and recovers to the same level again when new electrolyte is used (Fig. S15 online). SEM (Fig. S16 online) and XRD (Fig. S17 online) measurements confirmed the morphological stability and well-retained interlayer structure after ECH. Accordingly, XPS was further used to identify a negligible decrease of 1T proportion that is the key to fulfil the requirement of ECH (Fig. S18 online). XPS results present slight surface oxidation, which is possibly associated with the strong bonding of OH− on the oxophilic surface of MoS2 [44]. However, the MoS2-DMA retains the high ECH activity (Faradaic efficiency and selectivity) in cycling tests, indicating the negligible influence on the ECH. In mechanism study, an isotope labeling test (Fig. S19 online) was conducted with Na2B4O7/D2O electrolyte to identify the hydrogen source. The received products on MoS2-DMA were analyzed by LC-MS. The molecular mass of FOL was determined to be 100, consistent with the normal FAL added with two D. In comparison, the FOL obtained using Na2B4O7/H2O as electrolyte presented a molecular mass of only 98. It was thus demonstrated that the hydrogen source of ECH was H2O in the electrolyte. Therefore, the ECH may eventuate through the following steps: H2O discharges on catalyst surface to form active hydrogen (Hads) via Volmer process [45], which can hydrogenate FALads to FOL, or to H2 via a Tafel/Heyrovsky step. In this regard, enhanced hydrogen binding energy (HBE) on surface sites is desirable for ECH, because it can stabilize Hads toward FAL hydrogenation, rather than H2 evolution. For Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism [46], the catalyst surface further requires strengthened furfural binding energy (FBE) to effectively activate the C=O moiety. Density functional theoretical (DFT) calculation was further performed on MoS2 samples with various intercalants, to acquire the HBE and FBE associated with phase (2H or 1T) and interlayer chemistry. The slabs with a typical 2H configuration were adopted for non-expanded MoS2, and the 1T slabs intercalated by NH4 + and DMA+ were taken for MoS2-A and MoS2-DMA, respectively (Figs. S20 and S21 online). Electron density diagram (Fig. 5 a) demonstrates that the phase transition from 2H to 1T obviously causes electron localization around Mo and S atoms in MoS2-A and MoS2-DMA. The overlap of potential energy surface (PES) between slabs and intercalants is also visible, indicating possible electronic perturbations. This is consistent with EPR measurement (Fig. S11 online), which shows the varying g values of S vacancy due to electronic interactions with NH4 + and DMA+. Fig. 5b further depicts the projected density of states (PDOS) of the three models. MoS2-A and MoS2-DMA afford enriched d states around the Fermi level (E F), in comparison with semiconducting 2H-MoS2. Such alteration should be ascribed to the phase transition (2H → 1T), as well as the electronic perturbations by NH4 + and DMA+. MoS2-DMA acquires even higher PDOS at the E F than MoS2-A, in line with its more overlapping of PES (Fig. 5a). Accordingly, MoS2, MoS2-A, and MoS2-DMA present the d-band center (εd ) of −2.18, −0.95, and −1.54 eV, respectively, indicating the varied binding energies with reaction intermediates or substrates [47]. Further, the binding energies of Hads and FALads that are the reactive species of a Langmuir–Hinshelwood surface reaction (inset of Fig. 5c) were analyzed. Both Mo and S sites on the edge and basal plane were considered. The (100) and (010) planes were equivalent in a hexagonal crystal, herein (100) was adopted as the representative. The results summarized in Fig. 5c illustrate that the bindings on the basal plane are weaker than those on edge sites, which is in good accordance with the results of previous reports [48,49]. Significant attention should be paid on the sites with both negative HBE and FBE, which ensures the effective chemisorption of Hads and FALads toward hydrogenation. Thereby, the Mo-sites on (100) planes that are marked in a yellow background in Fig. 5c are of great concern. Among them, the binding of Hads on MoS2 is relatively weaker (HBE: −0.07 eV), preferring HER [50]; while the FALads binding on MoS2-A is not strong enough (FBE: −0.49 eV) to activate C=O for hydrogenation. Only MoS2-DMA could synchronously afford strong Hads (−0.45 eV) and FALads (−1.73 eV) bindings on the Mo-sites, thereby benefiting the stabilized Hads to hydrogenate activated FALads, and enabling a fast surface elementary step. Moreover, MoS2-DMA gains improved hydrophobicity due to alkyl-amine intercalation (Fig. 2d). Its surface favors FAL approaching toward catalytic sites to surmount the diffusion limitation. To this end, the ECH over time was monitored at a negative potential of −0.45 V (vs. RHE), at which the formation of Hads could be regarded as a fast equilibrium step owing to rapid H2O discharge. Obviously, MoS2-DMA delivers the feature of a zero-order reaction (Fig. S22a online), indicating the negligible limitation by FAL transport [51]. Comparative analysis indicates that the limitation turns to obvious on MoS2 and MoS2-A, which afford a first-order reaction profile. When the initial FAL concentration ([FAL]) is varied from 0.025 to 0.045 mol L−1, the rate for generating FOL over MoS2-DMA exhibits negligible dependence on [FAL], but linear dependence over MoS2 and MoS2-A owing to their hydrophilic surface (Fig. S22b online). The ECH of FAL relies on the following three factors: HBE, FBE, and surface hydrophobicity, which essentially determine the stability of Hads, the activation of FAL, and the mass transport of FAL, respectively. These factors were compared for MoS2, MoS2-A, and MoS2-DMA (Fig. 5d). Obviously, only MoS2-DMA deserves all the merits, thereby accomplishing superior ECH performance. Both MoS2 and MoS2-A suffer from their poor surface hydrophobicity, and unsatisfied bindings with either Hads or FALads. For the first time, interlayer engineering was introduced to turn MoS2 from a typical HER electrocatalyst to an efficient candidate for ECH. This discovery undoubtedly provides a roadmap for catalyst design in electrochemical synthesis. In a further set of experiments, the efficacy of MoS2-DMA for the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of other subtracts (Fig. 6 ) was examined, e.g., 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (5-HMF), cinnamaldehyde (CAL), and p-nitrophenol (p-NP). Chronoamperometry experiments were operated at −0.25 V for 2 h, ensuring considerable conversion (30%–60%). The ECH of 5-HMF effectively produced 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF) with Faradaic efficiency of 75% and high selectivity of > 99%. In case of CAL, the efficiency to produce cinnamyl alcohol (COL) exceeded 68% and the selectivity was close to 90%. In general, α,β-unsaturated aldehydes prefer the C=C hydrogenation rather than the C=O in thermocatalysis [52]. The high selectivity of 90% via ECH provides a new route to produce valuable unsaturated alcohols. High selectivity and efficiency (>99%) were also observed in the reduction of p-NP to p-aminophenol (p-AP), highlighting the good efficacy of MoS2-DMA."
8,Conclusion,"In this study, for the first time non-precious MoS2 was developed as the active and selective electrocatalysts for ECH via facile interlayer engineering. The optimal MoS2-DMA accomplished efficient reduction of FAL to FOL with high Faradaic efficiency (86.3%–73.3%) and selectivity (>95%) at −0.25 to −0.65 V (vs. RHE), outperforming non-intercalated MoS2 and most conventional metals (e.g., Pt, Pd, Ag, Ni, Cu, etc.). Its efficacy in ECH was also highlighted for various substrates. Regarding the easy oxidation of MoS2-DMA at highly positive potential, a rational coupling with high-performance anodic electrocatalysts (e.g., Ni-based hydroxides, phosphides, selenides, etc. [53]) in future is expected to realize the efficient electro-refinement of biomass with doubled electron efficiency. Moreover, the insight into ECH over intercalated MoS2 identified the intrinsic correlation between reaction kinetics and interlayer chemistry, and well interpreted how MoS2, the typical H2 evolution electrocatalyst, could be modulated toward efficient ECH. The intercalation of alkyl-amines afforded effective regulation on HBE, FBE, and surface hydrophobicity to achieve accelerated hydrogenation kinetics. This is inspirational for catalyst design in electrochemical synthesis, based on the booming water-splitting electrocatalysts developed recently."
