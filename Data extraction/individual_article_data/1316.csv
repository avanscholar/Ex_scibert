0,Introduction,"The ever-increasing world population and economic growth result in 4 Gigatons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere per year, and most of them come from fossil resources [1]. Renewable energy can mitigate carbon emissions while maintaining a sustainable world [2–4]. However, wind and solar energy are highly intermittent, causing the supply and demand mismatch that severely destabilizes power grids. One solution is to transform surplus renewable electrical energy into chemicals, which can be stored off-grid for an extended period. For instance, electrochemical CO2 reduction to chemicals such as formate not only reduces globally accelerating CO2 emissions but also produce value-added products [5–17]. Among all of the CO2 electro-conversion processes, CO2-to-formate has the potential to be economically feasible for large-scale applications [18]. A recent study demonstrated that electrochemical CO2 reduction exhibits a Faradaic efficiency of 95 % towards formate generation at relatively low overpotential, paving the road to commercialization [9]. Indeed, formic acid/formate has been widely used in many fields, such as food and feed additives, as well as leather-tanning and dye-fixing agents [19]. Besides, formate is a platform chemical to produce other chemicals, including alcohols, carboxylic acids, plastic monomers, pigments, etc. [20,21]. Moreover, it is also the potential hydrogen storage material for fuel cell applications [22–25]. However, the market size of the formic acid/formate is relatively small, as only less than one million tons of formic acid/formate was produced per year [26]. In comparison, the annual methanol production reached ∼ 97 million tons in 2019 [27]. Methanol is an alternative fuel [28–33] and one of the most important organic feedstocks to synthesize other chemicals in the chemical industry [34,35]. Methanol, as a liquid hydrogen storage carrier, harbors more hydrogen content than formic acid/formate [36]. Hence, converting formic acid/formate to methanol can improve the supply of formic acid//formate from CO2 electro-reduction and satisfy the methanol demand. Hydrogenation of esters to the corresponding alcohols is a fundamental chemical process in organic chemistry. For instance, formate esters such as methyl formate and ethyl formate have been used as the feedstocks for methanol synthesis [37–43]. Also, formate is studied as the intermediate of CO2 hydrogenation in liquid phase [44]. In particular, copper-based catalysts promote the hydrogenation of ester bonds while, at the same time, they are relatively inactive for CC bond hydrogenolysis [45–49]. Adkins et al. [50] investigated various esters’ hydrogenation over copper-based catalysts at high pressures in the liquid phase. Although the Cu catalyst exhibited fairly good catalytic performance, the byproduct, water, inhibited the catalyst activity and lowered the desired alcohol products’ yield. Researchers have come to realize the importance of interaction between Cu metal and support to address this challenge [51–53]. Notably, the surface property of oxide support such as Lewis/Bronsted acid or base also plays a role in the activity and selectivity of catalysts. ZnO, ZrO2, Al2O3, and SiO2 supported catalysts are commonly used in ester hydrogenation [46,51–53]. The possible synergetic effect between the metal catalyst and the support may promote the conversion of formate esters to methanol. However, it is still not well understood how the catalyst synthesis method affects the interactions between metal and support and thus improves catalytic performance. We prepared various catalysts for the hydrogenation of ethyl formate to methanol in ethanol solvent in this work. There are three questions to be answered: what is the best-performed metal oxide supported metal catalyst for converting ethyl formate to methanol? What is the structure-activity relationship of the catalyst? And how does the catalyst synthesis method affect catalyst performance?"
1,Results and discussion,
2,Catalyst and the solvent screening,"2.1 Catalyst and the solvent screening The hydrogenation of ethyl formate to methanol over various catalysts, including various Cu and Pd based catalysts, was investigated under the same reaction conditions, as shown in Fig. 1 . It was found that Cu/ZrO2 was superior to other metals or bimetallic catalysts in terms of improving the yield of methanol. The Pd-based catalysts were generally less active in the hydrogenation of ethyl formate. Comparing Pd/ZrO2 with Pd-Fe/ZrO2 and Pd-Re/ZrO2, alloying Fe with Pd seemed to slightly improve the methanol yield at the expense of producing more gaseous byproducts, while adding Re decreased the activity of the Pd/ZrO2 catalyst. Surprisingly, adding Zn suppressed the activity of the Cu/ZrO2 catalyst significantly, as no methanol was produced on the Cu-Zn/ZrO2. The Pd-Cu bimetallic catalysts had the same activity as the physical mixture of Pd/ZrO2 and Cu/ZrO2. Still, the performances of both bimetallic catalysts were inferior to that of the Cu/ZrO2 catalyst. Our findings agree with other groups’ observations that Pd was not active for the hydrogenation of formic acid/formate [54]. Various metal oxides supported Cu catalysts were prepared to investigate the hydrogenation of ethyl formate (Table 1 , entries 1, 4–9). All the tested metal oxides, except ZnO, displayed the promotional effects on the Cu catalyzed hydrogenation of ethyl formate to methanol. In particular, ZrO2, an amphoteric metal oxide support, was superior to other oxides for promoting selective hydrogenation of ethyl formate to methanol. Chen et al. [55] used the supported Cu catalysts and the Pd-Cu bimetallic catalyst to hydrogenate formate to methanol in 1,4-dioxane (Table 1, entries 10–13), indicating that the acidity or basicity of the support would affect the selectivity of methanol production. It also has been reported that the weak Lewis acid sites on the ZrO2 surface, which are located close to the Cu nanoparticles, facilitate the formation of methanol [56,57]. In contrast, the Cu/Al2O3 catalyst was less selective in the ethyl formate hydrogenation since it also catalyzed the conversion of ethanol to produce a considerable amount of 1,1-diethoxy-ethane (Figure S1, Scheme S1). It is suggested that ethanol was absorbed on the surface of Al2O3, a weak acid, and underwent dehydration to produce acetaldehyde, which further reacted with ethanol to form 1,1-diethoxy-ethane. For comparison, the weak basic support, e.g., ZnO, showed no promotional effect on the ethyl formate-to-methanol reaction. The basic catalyst would be deactivated soon with the trace amounts of carbon dioxide and water, which are the by-products of the ethyl formate hydrogenation reaction [58]. The yield of methanol with either unsupported copper or ZrO2 only (Table 1, entries 7, 8) is lower than that with Cu/ZrO2, indicating that the interaction between the ZrO2 support and Cu particles can enhance the performance of the Cu/ZrO2 catalyst. The presence of water may deactivate the Cu/ZrO2 catalysts. Here, different amounts of deionized water were deliberately added to the anhydrous ethanol as the solvents. As a result, we observed that water has a significantly negative effect on the hydrogenation reaction, as shown in Table 1. Compared with aqueous ethanol solution (Table 1, entries 2, 3), the methanol yield reached up to ∼ 53 % with the Cu/ZrO2 catalyst in the absence of deionized water (Table 1, entry 1). With increasing the percentage of deionized water in ethanol from 0 to 0.5 %, the methanol yield decreased sharply to only ∼ 3.1 %. Simultaneously, a large amount of CO2 (∼ 24 %) was produced (Table 1, entry 2), which suggested that a trace amount of water diverted the ethyl formate conversion pathway from hydrogenation to decomposition. Ilinich et al. [59] indicated that the Cu/Al2O3 catalyst was deactivated in the water-gas shift reaction due to the passivation of the catalytically active surface by the dense shell of hydrogen-bonded hydroxides strongly adsorbed over CuOx crystallites. The same group also revealed a correlation between the degree of catalysts deactivation and the OH− group FTIR band intensity. Likewise, water was readily dissociated over the Cu/ZrO2 surface. Thus, the formation of strongly adsorbed OH− groups over copper oxide might cause the catalyst’s deactivation in ethyl formate hydrogenation."
3,Structure-activity relationship of Cu/ZrO2,"2.2 Structure-activity relationship of Cu/ZrO2 To further optimize the Cu/ZrO2 catalysts’ performance, various reaction conditions and catalyst properties were investigated in detail, including reaction temperature, reaction pressure, copper loading, and calcination temperature of the catalysts. Fig. 2 shows that increasing the reaction temperature from 100 °C to 140 °C led to a remarkable increase in the methanol yield. A minor enhancement in the methanol yield was observed by further increasing the reaction temperature from 140 °C to 160 °C, whereas more gaseous products, especially CH4, were produced. At 180 °C, much less methanol was produced, inferring that hydrogenation is an exothermic, reversible reaction [60]. Therefore, increasing the reaction temperature could lower the equilibrium conversions, while, at the same time, more byproducts were produced at elevated temperatures. The rate of hydrogenation was strongly affected by hydrogen pressure, as shown in Fig. 3 a. Increasing the reaction pressure from 200 psi to 400 psi nearly doubled the yield of methanol (from ∼ 26.9 % to ∼ 52.9 %). However, the methanol yield was kept nearly unchanged as the H2 pressure further increased from 400 psi to 1000 psi, implying that the hydrogenation of ethyl formate on Cu-based catalyst is a Langmuir-Hinshelwood surface adsorption mechanism [61–63] and 400 psi of H2 could saturate the catalyst surface. The first-order kinetics was observed when the hydrogen pressure was low, while the reaction order became zero order as the hydrogen pressure was higher than 400 psi. Different Cu loading on ZrO2 was tuned for the selective conversion of ethyl formate to methanol, as shown in Fig. 3b. The yield of methanol increased with copper loading and achieved the highest value when the copper loading was about 20 wt%. Interestingly, the methanol yield decreased with a higher copper loading, i.e., 40 %. It is well accepted that nucleation, growth, and coalescence of oxide and metal nanoparticles on planar and porous substrates are complex processes [64–66]. Liu et al. [67] demonstrated that specific copper surface areas and associated dispersions were strongly metal loading dependent. They found that copper dispersion and copper surface area increased with low copper loading but decreased at higher copper loading, which further influenced the product yield of the catalytic reaction system. Different calcination temperature was investigated to understand the interaction between Cu and ZrO2. Fig. 4 a shows the methanol yield over various Cu/ZrO2 catalysts at different calcination temperatures. The methanol yield increased from ∼ 20 % to ∼ 53 % over the Cu/ZrO2 catalysts, with the catalyst calcination temperature increased from 400 °C to 600 °C. In comparison, the yield of methanol was only ∼ 30 % over the Cu/ZrO2 catalyst calcined at 700 °C. Correspondingly, a significantly different variation of the structure evolution was observed in the copper and zirconia phases as the function of the calcination temperature for the catalyst synthesis, as shown in Fig. 4b. Upon the calcination temperature from 400 °C to 700 °C, a progressive increase of the Cu phase's crystallite size was identified, as reflected from a continuous sharpening and intensification of the Cu (111) diffraction peak for the samples. Only the weak and broad diffraction peaks of Cu and ZrO2 were observed for the catalysts calcined at 400 °C and 500 °C, indicating the amorphous or semi-crystalline nature of the zirconia. As the calcination temperature increased to 600 °C, the diffraction peaks of the metastable tetragonal ZrO2 phase (t-ZrO2) appeared. As the temperature up to 700 °C, the intensity of the tetragonal ZrO2 peaks increased drastically. The crystallite sizes of the copper particle were estimated from the main peak at about 43° using the Scherrer equation, and the values for all the catalysts at 600 °C, 700 °C, and 800 °C are 19.3 nm, 27.5 nm, and 32.5 nm, respectively. Note that the catalyst activity declined when the calcination temperature was higher than 600 °C. The lower yield of methanol with the larger copper particle size was thus verified. To further understand the structure-activity relationship of the Cu/ZrO2 catalyst, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) of the fresh and spent Cu/ZrO2 catalysts at different calcination temperatures was performed. Note that the spent catalysts were collected after the first run of reaction, separated from the liquid phase, and dried overnight at 80 °C in an oven. Fig. 5 showed that only one broad peak, which refers to the reduction of CuO, was observed in each TPR spectrum of all the tested samples. As the catalyst calcination temperature of the different Cu/ZrO2 samples increased from 400 °C to 600 °C, the CuO reduction peak was kept at approximately 188 °C. As the calcination temperature raised to 700 °C, the CuO reduction peak became broader. The peak reduction temperature was shifted to 197 °C, implying a larger CuO crystallite size that led to a lower methanol yield. On the other hand, compared with the fresh Cu/ZrO2 catalysts, spent catalysts could be reduced at lower reduction temperatures. Thus the spent CuO was more easily reduced than fresh CuO and might have a higher activity toward the hydrogenation of ethyl formate. The HRTEM was employed to investigate the morphology of catalysts, and the results are shown in Fig. 6 . All tested catalyst samples with 20 wt% copper loading were prepared at different calcination temperatures by the impregnation method. When the catalyst was calcined at 400 °C, the copper particles were non-uniform and asymmetric, surrounding by the ZrO2 particles (Fig. 6a). As the calcination temperature raised to 600 °C, the Cu (1 1 1) crystalline facet was detected, the Cu particles might be formed on the surface of ZrO2, but the Cu particles mixed with ZrO2 were not readily distinguished, as seen in Fig. 6b. Furthermore, the SEM images (Figure S2) showed that the Cu particles of Cu/ZrO2-600 dispersed more uniformly than those of Cu/ZrO2-400. In contrast, as can be seen in Fig. 6c, the large Cu particles of Cu/ZrO2-700 were segregated from ZrO2, indicating that the interactions between Cu and ZrO2 were much weakened (Scheme 1 ), which was inferior to the hydrogenation of ethyl formate. To identify the surface chemical composition, XPS was used to analyze three 20 wt% Cu/ZrO2 catalysts: Cu/ZrO2-400, Cu/ZrO2-600, and Cu/ZrO2-700. All binding energy values are calibrated to the C 1s signal, which is set at 284.6 eV. Fig. 7 a shows the high-resolution XPS scans of Cu 2p with four classic-type peaks near 932.4 eV (Cu(0) 2p3/2), 934.2 eV (Cu(2+) 2p3/2), 952.3 eV (Cu(0) 2p1/2) and 954.2 eV (Cu(2+) 2p1/2) [68–72] in fresh Cu/ZrO2-400. For the spent catalyst, the binding energy of the Cu 2p3/2 peaks displayed a noticeable shift, indicating that a portion of Cu° in the fresh catalyst was transformed to Cu2+ after the reaction. Cu° is the primary valence state of the metallic copper in the fresh catalyst, while the percentage of Cu2+ in the Cu/ZrO2-400 catalyst was markedly increased from 45.9 % before the reaction to 60.6 % after the reaction, shown in Table 2 . In contrast, the Cu/ZrO2-600 catalyst exhibited the best activity; however, it’s Cu2+ 2p2/3 XPS peak intensity only increased slightly after the reaction (Fig. 7b), which implied that the Cu/ZrO2-600 catalyst was rather stable in the hydrogenation of ethyl formate. The binding energy of Cu2+ in Cu/ZrO2-600 is similar to that in Cu/ZrO2-400, while the percentage of Cu2+ in Cu/ZrO2-600 is about 50 % higher than that in Cu/ZrO2-400. The formation of the oxidation valence state of Cu in two catalysts may be due to different causes: the former is ascribed to the larger Cu particle size. More copper particles are exposed at the external surface of the ZrO2 support, leading to the readiness toward oxidation. The latter may be due to the electron transfer from the copper to the support. Fig. 7c shows that the amount of Cu2+ in the Cu/ZrO2-700 catalyst increased significantly after the reaction. On the other hand, the Zr 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks of all the Cu/ZrO2 catalysts have similar binding energies, ∼181 eV and ∼184 eV, for Zr 3d5/2 and Zr 3d3/2, respectively (Figure S3), suggesting that the ZrO2 support is relatively stable. According to the above results, it can be concluded that the interaction between ZrO2 and Cu would affect the valence state of Cu and further affect the selectivity and the activity of catalysts. The change in the percentage of Cu2+ in the various Cu/ZrO2 catalysts may imply the stability of the catalysts. Interestingly, fresh Cu/ZrO2-600 has much more %(Zr 3d3/2) than others (Table S1). The stability test results with the 20 wt% Cu/ZrO2 catalysts echoed the XPS characterization results. The spent Cu/ZrO2-600 catalyst showed no loss in activity in the second recycle run (Fig. 8 ). Correspondingly, XPS characterization revealed that the Cu valence states only changed slightly before and after the reaction (Table 2). In contrast, the methanol yields decreased from ∼20.3 % over the fresh 20 wt% Cu/ZrO2-400 catalyst to ∼ 15.7 % over the spent one. Likewise, the methanol yields decreased from 26.8 % to 23.8 % over the fresh and spent 20 wt% Cu/ZrO2-700 catalysts, respectively. The reduced catalyst activity in recycling experiments is likely ascribed to the considerable change in the percentage of Cu2+. It is reasonable that the Cu/ZrO2-600 is the most stable catalyst among the three tested catalysts due to the rather stable electronic structure of Cu. Note that the methanol yields decreased obviously with the significantly increased Cu2+ content in both Cu/ZrO2-400 and Cu/ZrO2-700. However, the high percentage of Cu2+ does not necessarily relate to the low catalyst activity. Among all three fresh catalysts, the Cu/ZrO2-600 catalyst has the highest amount of the Cu2+ content and the highest activity."
4,Conclusion,"This study demonstrated that zirconia supported copper catalysts synthesized by impregnation were superior to the other supported metal or bimetallic catalysts toward converting ethyl formate to methanol. However, the reaction conditions such as temperature and hydrogen partial pressure had profound effects on the selectivity and yield of methanol. The presence of a low amount of water substantially decreased the methanol yield. Under the optimized conditions, i.e., 160 °C and 400 psi H2, up to 53 % of methanol was yielded from the hydrogenation of ethyl formate in anhydrous ethanol solvent over the 20 wt% Cu/ZrO2-600 catalyst. The Cu loading and the calcination temperature in the preparation process of the Cu/ZrO2 catalysts affected the Cu − Zr synergistic interaction, such as the crystalline structures, the dispersion of Cu particles on ZrO2 surfaces, as well as the valence state of Cu. As the calcination temperature increased from 400 °C to 600 °C, the amorphous ZrO2 was transformed into the tetragonal crystalline ZrO2, on which the Cu particles were well dispersed. However, copper particles were segregated from ZrO2 as the catalyst was calcined at 700 °C, indicating the weak interaction between Cu and ZrO2, which also lowered catalysts’ activity. The XPS spectra revealed that the percentage of Cu2+ in Cu/ZrO2-600 varied slightly before and after the reaction, which implied that the catalyst was stable. The findings in this work will facilitate the catalyst development for converting formate to methanol, which may expand the production of formate from CO2 electro-reduction while further satisfying the ever-increasing market demand for methanol."

7,Catalyst preparation,"4.2 Catalyst preparation A series of metal/ZrO2 catalysts were prepared by impregnation. The excess NaOH was added into 20 mL deionized water, and the ZrO(NO3)2 was dissolved in 10 mL deionized water. Then the ZrO(NO3)2 solution was added dropwise into the NaOH solution at 80 °C and stirred for 2 h. After centrifuging and washing with deionized water for 4 times, the ZrO2 precursor was obtained. The metal precursors (Cu(NO3)2, Pd(NO3)2, Zn(NO3)2, Fe(NO3)3, ReCl3) was dropwise added into the slurry solution of the ZrO2 precursor and stirred overnight. After that, the solutions were dried in a 50 °C oil bath while stirring. Dry solid was calcined in a muffle furnace at the set temperature for 3 h in the air atmosphere. The calcined catalysts were then reduced with H2 (50 mL/min) at 400 °C for 3 h to obtain the metal/ZrO2-x (x means the calcination temperature). To prepare Cu catalysts supported on other metal oxide materials, the Cu precursor, Cu(NO3)2, and the metal oxide support, e.g., Al2O3, ZnO, SiO2, etc., were mixed in 10 mL deionized water and stirred overnight to load Cu on different supports. The solids were separated by centrifugation and washed with deionized water for 4 times. The catalysts were calcinated in the air at 600 °C for 3 h and then reduced in H2 (50 mL/min) at 400 °C for 3 h."
8,Catalyst characterization,"4.3 Catalyst characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured on a Rigaku SmartLab powder X-ray diffractometer using Co-Kα radiation source (λ= Å) at a 2θ step of 10° - 90° with a step size of 0.02°. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was tested on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 (Chemisorption Analyzer) instrument. In a typical measurement, the catalyst sample (50 mg) was purged with helium gas (50 cm3/min) at 100 °C for 10 min. The catalyst was then cooled down to room temperature, and the H2 pulses were injected from a calibrated on-line sampling valve. The samples' morphology and structure were analyzed by FEI Quanta 200 F field emission SEM, JEM-2100 F TEM. XPS was measured by a Qtac-100 LEISS-XPS instrument, using monochromatic Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV)."
9,Catalytic reaction,"4.4 Catalytic reaction All reactions were carried out in a 30 mL stirred micro-reactor. In a typical run, solid catalyst (0.1 g) and ethyl formate (0.18 g) was added into 10 mL ethanol in the reactor. The micro-reactor was then sealed and purged three times with high purity nitrogen and hydrogen, respectively, and then charged with H2 to the set pressure. The reactor was heated to the desired temperature at a ramp rate of 2 °C /min. After the 20-h reaction, the reactor was cooled down to room temperature. The gas-phase products were analyzed by a GC-TCD (GC-2014, Shimadzu) before dissembling the reactor. High-purity N2, CO2, CH4, and H2 were calibrated, and the calibration results were used to quantify the gaseous products. After dissembling the reactor, the samples were collected and centrifuged, and the liquid-phase products were analyzed by a GC-FID (GC-2010, Shimadzu). The product yield was calculated using the following equation: Y i e l d % = n i n 0 × 100 % Where n0 is the moles of ethyl formate before reaction, ni is the moles of product i after the reaction."
