0,Introduction,"The ongoing reduction of oil reserves and the environmental problems arising from their use gives rise to research interest in renewable resources of organic carbon, such as biomass and its derivatives (polyols, carboxylic acids, esters etc). The transformation of biomass to value added chemicals and fuels [1] is of high scientific and industrial interest. Unlike oil and gas, biomass contains a high percentage of oxygen (10–50 wt%). Therefore, the shifting from a petrochemical economy to a bio-economy requires the development of new efficient catalytic processes for the total or partial deoxygenation of biomass to fuels or chemicals. Oxygen removal can be achieved by hydrodeoxygenation or hydrogenolysis, dehydration, decarbonylation and decarboxylation of the CO bond. Among them, hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is one of the most attractive route for oxygen removal from biomass [2–5] and its derivatives [6–10]. Glycerol, a by-product of various industrial biomass conversion processes (saponification, fermentation of sugars, transesterification of oils and fats), is a low-cost renewable feedstock for the production of chemicals which are at the moment produced via petroleum-based routes [11]. Glycerol hydrodeoxygenation (removal of an oxygen atom from glycerol in the presence of hydrogen) to 1,2-propanediol is a process of high commercial and environmental value. 1,2-propanediol is a value added chemical with a wide range of applications in daily life (pharmaceuticals, food and tobacco industry, as antifreeze agent etc) and is conventionally produced by hydration of the fossil derived propylene oxide [12]. However, the need of external H2 supply in combination with its properties (high flammability and diffusivity) is the main disadvantage of this process. A promising, alternative approach is the in-situ hydrogen production directly on the active sites of the catalyst and its consecutive consumption for HDO. Hydrogen could be formed either sacrificing part of the feedstock or by adding a H2 donor compound in the feed (CTH-catalytic transfer hydrogenation). CTH is an effective method for the reduction of functional groups by transferring hydrogen either to unsaturated bonds (hydrogenation), i.e. CC, CC, CO, NO, NN, CN, or to single bonds (hydrogenolysis), i.e. CO, CN, CS and CHalogen and has been reviewed extensively [13–16]. Biomass and its derivatives are promising sources for hydrogen production. The group of Dumesic [14] demonstrated for the first time that it is possible to produce hydrogen via a liquid phase reforming reaction (APR) of polyols derived from biomass (such as ethylene glycol, methanol, glycerol, sorbitol) under mild reaction conditions (523 K). Any compound (organic or inorganic) with low oxidation potential containing hydrogen can act as hydrogen donor. The low oxidation potential makes feasible the hydrogen transfer from the donor to the substrate under mild reaction conditions [15]. Ideally, low cost and highly available renewable compounds should be selected as H2 donors. Usually, compounds containing hydrogen bonded to elements or groups with similar electronegativity to that of hydrogen itself, provide better hydrogen donor properties [16]. Alcohols, hydrazine, formic acid and formates, amines, hydrides of boron, aluminum, silicon etc. are common H2 donors. An additional advantage is obtained when the H2 donor’s decomposition products have large negative enthalpies of formation [16]. This property allows the stability of the dehydrogenation product, preventing the reverse reaction (to donor formation). For this type of reactions, it has been reported that adjacent sites on the catalyst surface are necessary for donor and acceptor molecules [17] as this facilitates the hydrogen transfer and avoids condensation reactions to heavier by-products. In addition, as the H2 donor is going to be used in a combined reaction cycle, the catalyst and the reactions conditions used for the hydrodeoxygenation should also favor the dehydrogenation of the H2 donor. To further improve the performance to the desired product, parallel H2 donor reactions, beyond that of dehydrogenation, should be minimized. Moreover, in the selection of H2 donor, the competitive adsorption between donor and acceptor on the catalyst surface should be taken into account as they may also affect the performance of the process. Two approaches have been explored for glycerol HDO to 1,2-propanediol without external H2 supply. The first one is the HDO of glycerol with H2 produced via aqueous phase reforming (APR) of a part of the glycerol [18–26]. This concept, has been studied at temperatures between 180–250 °C and for 1–24 h reaction time, using mainly noble metal (Pt, Ru) but also Cu and Ni based catalysts. Glycerol conversion varies between 18% and 100%, showing 24–70.2% selectivity to 1,2-propanediol. The second approach, is glycerol HDO through catalytic transfer hydrogenation reactions (CTH), using a hydrogen donor molecule (alcohols, formic acid) with H2 to be formed via dehydrogenation or decomposition of the donor molecule [27–37]. Table 1 summarizes literature data referring to glycerol HDO via CTH employing several H2 donors. The majority of the catalysts evaluated are mono- and bimetallic Cu based catalysts. Glycerol conversion ranges from 28 to 100% and 1,2-propanediol selectivity between 64–95%, at 180–220 °C and for relative long reaction time 10–24 h. Our group has thoroughly studied the reaction of glycerol hydrodeoxygenation, under initial inert conditions and over a Cu:Zn:Al catalyst, using methanol as H2 donor [38]. The Cu:Zn:Al catalyst efficiently catalyzes CO bond hydro-dehydrogenation, showing poor activity for CC bond cleavage. Thus, it has been proved an efficient material for the combined reaction cycle of methanol APR and glycerol HDO, obtaining high yields to 1,2-propanediol (76.2%) at short reaction times (1 h) [37]. Over the Cu:Zn:Al catalyst, methanol reforming proved the main H2 source [36]. The key factor for the efficient operation of the reaction system is its availability to H2, as it tunes the conversion routes of glycerol and thus the target product selectivity [37,39]. When the system is in excess of hydrogen formed via methanol APR, glycerol HDO mainly proceeds via dehydration-hydrogenation route with hydroxyacetone as the main intermediate product [39], while the kinetics of the combined reaction cycle is adequately described by a Langmuir – Hinshelwood reaction model [40]. The present work explores the effect of various biomass-derived hydrogen donors in liquid phase hydrodeoxygenation of glycerol to 1,2-propanediol, over a Cu:Zn:Al catalyst. Methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, 2-propanol, 1-propanol, formic acid, 1-butanol, 2-butanol and tert-butanol were tested as hydrogen donors. The effectiveness of each compound to transfer hydrogen was compared with that of glycerol and water in the feed, under inert atmosphere."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst synthesis,"2.1 Catalyst synthesis The Cu:Zn:Al bulk catalyst with metal mass composition 49:26:3.5 was prepared by the oxalate gel co-precipitation method. An alcoholic solution of oxalic acid was rapidly injected into the alcoholic solution of metal precursors (Cu(NO3)3·3H2O, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, Al(NO3)3·9H2O), under vigorous stirring. Ethanol was used as the alcoholic solvent. After 1 h stirring and aging, ethanol was separated using rotary evaporator. Afterwards, drying (120 °C, 12 h) and stepwise calcination (up to 360 °C) were followed."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The surface area of the fresh calcined sample was determined by N2 adsorption at −196 °C using a multipoint BET analysis method with an Autosorb-1 Quantachrome flow apparatus. Prior to the measurements, the samples were treated under vacuum at 250 °C overnight. The active copper metal surface area was determined by a dissociative N2O adsorption method. The experiment was performed in a gas flow system equipped with a quadrupole mass analyzer (OmniStar™, PFEIFFER). Typically, a fresh catalyst sample (150 mg) was placed in a U-shaped quartz reactor and pre-treated in flowing He for 0.5 h at 250 °C, followed by cooling at room temperature. Catalyst pre-reduction was performed by raising the temperature to the reduction temperature (420 °C) at a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 in a 10% H2/He flow for 0.5 h, followed by cooling to 50 °C under He flow. Then, the sample was exposed to N2O flow for 0.5 h at 50 °C in order to oxidize the surface CuO to Cu2O by adsorptive decomposition of N2O. Finally, TPR was carried out on the freshly oxidized Cu2O surface in order to reduce Cu2O to metallic Cu, increasing the temperature from room to 450 °C with 10 °C min−1 ramp rate using 10% H2/He flow. Copper surface area and particle size was calculated using data adopted from the literature [41]. The diffractogram of the catalyst was obtained using a Siemens D500 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. An TG209 Tarsus (Nertzsch) thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) instrument was employed for characterization of the fresh reduced and calcined and used catalytic samples. TG209 works in conjunction with a controller and associated software to make up a thermal analysis system. A small quantity of the sample was placed in an aluminium sample cap and the temperature was raised from room temperature to 900 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 in synthetic air flow (100 cm3 min−1)."
4,Activity tests,"2.3 Activity tests The reaction tests were carried out in a 100 ml monel batch reactor (Parr Instruments) equipped with an electronic temperature controller and a mechanical stirrer. In glycerol HDO tests using glycerol reformation as H2 source, the effect of operating conditions such as reaction time, reaction temperature and glycerol concentration was studied under 2.0 MPa N2, by varying the parameters at ranges of t = 0–2 h, T: 180–250 °C and CGLY: 4–20 wt%, respectively. The reactivity and selectivity of each H2 donor to H2 was tested by conducting tests with 30 ml aqueous solution of 66 mmol H2 donor as a feed, without the presence of glycerol, at 250 °C, for 1 h reaction time, under 2.0 MPa N2, and over 0.5 g Cu:Zn:Al. The effect of hydrogen donor concentration on glycerol HDO was investigated by varying the donor/glycerol molar ratio from 1.8 to 20.5 for the alcohols and from 0.5 to 5.5 for the formic acid, at constant initial glycerol concentration (4 wt% or 13 mmol). The tests with the combined feed were conducted at 250 °C, for 1 h reaction time, under 2.0 MPa N2, using glycerol/catalyst mass ratio = 2.4 (0.5 g Cu:Zn:Al). The reaction sequence was as follows: loading of the reactor with reaction mixture and the appropriate amount of catalyst, purging of the reactor with 2.0 MPa N2 (two times) in order to remove air, leakage check and final purging with 2.0 MPa N2, increasing the reactor temperature at 250 °C under constant stirring (500 rpm). Before the catalytic test, the catalyst was reduced at 420 °C for 2 h in a flowing mixture of 30% H2/N2. At the end of the reaction, the system was forced to cool to room temperature and the gas products were collected in a gas bag. Catalyst powder in the liquid phase was recovered by filtration. Liquid samples were analyzed by GC (Agilent 7890 A, FID,DB-Wax 30 m × 0.53 mm × 1.0 μm). Gas analysis was performed in an Agilent GC (7890 A, Molecular 175 Sieve and Poraplot columns) equipped with thermal conductivity detector. The typical HDO liquid products detected were: 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO), ethylene glycol (EG), hydroxyacetone (HA), 1-propanol (1-PrOH), ethanol (EtOH), acetaldehyde (acetal) and propanal (propionaldehyde). Low quantities of side liquid products with 4–6 C atoms (i.e. butane-1,2-diol, hexane-2,5-dione) were also identified by GC–MS analysis. The gaseous products were mainly CO2 and H2. CO was also detected but due to the low reaction temperature (250 °C) and the high activity of the CuZnAl catalyst towards the water gas shift reaction its concentration is very low. In addition, products exclusively related to H2 donor reactions were also detected (their possible formation reactions are given in SI). In glycerol HDO tests using glycerol reformation as H2 source the carbon balance in all experiments was 87% (unless otherwise is stated). In glycerol HDO tests using H2 donor dehydrogenation/reforming as H2 source the glycerol’s carbon balance was depended on the H2 donor. For example glycerol’s carbon balance in the presence of: methanol is 92%, 2-propanol is 92%, ethylene glycol is 90%, formic acid is 87%, 1-propanol is 81%, ethanol 69%, 1-butanol is 68%, 2-butanol is 56% and tert-butanol is 73% (unless otherwise is stated). The conversion of glycerol, product selectivity, yield and productivity were calculated using the equations given below: C o n v e r s i o n , % = m o l e s i n - m o l e s o u t m o l e s i n ∙ 100 S e l e c t i v i t y t o l i q u i d p r o d u c t i , % = C a r b o n m o l e s o f p r o d u c t i C a r b o n m o l e s o f g l y c e r o l r e a c t e d ∙ 100 Y i e l d o f p r o d u c t i , % = m o l e s o f p r o d u c t i g l y c e r o l m o l e s i n ∙ 100 C o n s u m p t i o n o r f o r m a t i o n r a t e = r e a c t e d o r f o r m e d m o l e s w c a t a l y s t ∙ h G l y c e r o l ' s c a r b o n b a l a n c e , % = g C o f p r o d u c t s + g C o f n o n r e a c t i n g g l y c e r o l i n i t i a l g C o f g l y c e r o l ∙ 100 1,2 - p r o p a n e d i o l p r o d u c t i v i t y = k g 1,2 - P D O k g c a t a l y s t ∙ h ∙ 100 Standard Gibbs energy of reactions, ΔG˚R = Σ (n ΔG˚f, products) – Σ (m ΔG˚f, reactants) Where: n, m = the stoichiometry coefficients of reactants and products, respectively ΔG˚f = the Gibbs energy of formation at 298 °C, 1 atm, assuming that all reactants and products behave as an ideal gas [42]."
5,Results & discussion,
6,Catalyst basic characterization,"3.1 Catalyst basic characterization A Cu:Zn:Al catalyst with 49:26:3.5 wt% metal composition, prepared by oxalate gel co-precipitation method, was chosen to be evaluated in glycerol hydrodeoxygenation - H2 donor reforming/dehydrogenation tandem reaction system. The Cu:Zn:Al catalyst has been proved to be an efficient material for the combined reaction cycle of methanol APR and glycerol HDO, as it efficiently catalyze CO bond hydrodehydrogenation and do not promote the CC bond cleavage reactions to degradation products [37]. In addition, it is a low cost and easy to prepared catalytic material. In Table 2 are summarized the main physicochemical and morphological characteristics of the fresh Cu:Zn:Al catalyst. The BET surface area of the calcined sample was calculated to be 72 m2 g−1 and the active copper surface area measured by dissociative N2O adsorption was calculated to be 57 m2 gcat −1, while the Cu particle size is in the nanometer scale (5.8 nm). The broad peaks of CuO and ZnO which are observed in the XRD pattern of the fresh calcined catalyst (Fig. 1 ) imply good dispersion of both oxidic crystal phases, which is in agreement with the dispersion measurements using the N2O surface oxidation technique. In addition, Cu:Zn:Al catalyst showed satisfactory stability. Upon catalyst reuse, an initial activity loss of 35.0% was observed, due to Cu agglomeration, however the catalyst performance was improved and stabilized after the third run, because of Cu redispersion, as evidenced by the measurement of the active Cu area before and after reaction. The main reason for the agglomeration of the Cu particles proved to be the presence of water in the reaction solution. Worthy to note that during the five consecutive uses, the active sites maintained their structural integrity, with metallic Cu° being the active site for the selective conversion of glycerol [37]."
7,Glycerol hydrodeoxygenation with in-situ H2 production via glycerol aqueous phase reforming (APR),"3.2 Glycerol hydrodeoxygenation with in-situ H2 production via glycerol aqueous phase reforming (APR) In order to optimize the Cu:Zn:Al catalyst performance in glycerol HDO using glycerol reforming as H2 source, the effect of various operating conditions like reaction time, temperature and glycerol concentration was investigated. The results expressed as glycerol conversion, selectivity to products and 1,2-propanediol yield are presented in Fig. 2 . Besides, 1,2-propanediol (which is the main reaction product), other products detected in liquid phase were hydroxyacetone, 1-propanol, ethylene glycol and low amounts of methanol, ethanol and propanal. In the gas phase, the main products detected were H2, CO2 as well as CO, though at much lower concentration levels. CO could be considered an intermediate product of glycerol reforming as it further reacts with water (via WGS reaction) producing CO2 and H2. The effect of reaction time (0–2 h) was studied by keeping the reaction temperature constant at 250 °C. As it is shown in Fig. 2A, glycerol conversion is favored by the increment of reaction time, as expected, reaching 72% after 2 h of reaction. 1,2-propanediol is the main product formed, with a maximum selectivity (40.9%) at 1 h, followed by hydroxyacetone. Hydroxyacetone is the intermediate product of 1,2-propanediol formation, thus justifying the opposite trend of the two reactants selectivity lines. Glycerol APR is also favored by the increase of reaction time, as the total amount of the formed H2 is doubled with the increase of reaction time from 0.5 to 1 h. The total amount of the formed H2 was calculated taking into account the unreacted H2 and the H2 that was consumed for the formation of the hydrogenation products detected. The higher selectivity to hydroxyacetone (32.2%) in short reaction times, is attributed to lower formation rate of hydrogen. The slight decrease on 1,2-propanediol selectivity that is observed in relatively longer reaction times (2 h) is mainly related to glycerol conversion reactions to heavier products (as it is indicated by the lower by 12% glycerol’s carbon balance). Ethylene glycol selectivity remains almost constant. Ethylene glycol could be formed either via glycerol reforming or via glycerol hydrogenolysis [26,43,44]. A sequential hydrodeoxygenation of ethylene glycol leads to ethanol formation (with increasing selectivity 0.05 - 0.2%). The selectivity to ethanol as well as to propanal (˜0.8% selectivity) and methanol (0.3-0.4% selectivity) were low and thus not shown in Fig. 2A. The increase of reaction temperature from 180 °C to 250 °C, has also a positive effect on glycerol conversion and on 1,2-propanediol yield as well, which increases from 5.1% to 27.6%, (Fig. 2B). The selectivity to the desired diol presents its maximum value (43.1%) at 220 °C. At the same time, the consecutive HDO reaction of the desired product to 1-propanol is only slightly promoted by the temperature increment (1.5% selectivity). It seems that the extent of glycerol conversion to HDO products gradually decreases with the increase of reaction temperature, in favor of glycerol conversion to heavier products (like butane-1,2-diol, hexane-2,5-dione etc). In contrast to 1,2-propanediol, overall ethylene glycol selectivity decreases indicating that high temperatures do not favor glycerol hydrogenolysis reaction. The effect of glycerol concentration was studied by varying glycerol concentration from 4 to 20 wt%, at 250 °C and for 1 h reaction time (Fig. 2C). The observed decrease on glycerol conversion from 68.1% to 54.4% was expected considering the lower catalyst / glycerol mass ratio, with the increase of glycerol concentration in the feed. HDO product selectivity decreases with the increased amount of glycerol. The main reason is that denser glycerol solutions favor the side glycerol reactions to heavier products, more likely condensation reactions (glycerol’s carbon balance decreases by 23% with glycerol concentration from 4 to 20 wt%). Tuning the operating conditions allowed us to improve the performance of the Cu:Zn:Al catalyst in glycerol HDO without any other H2 donor. Low glycerol/catalyst mass ratios (2.4), and the combination of short reaction times (1 h) and high reaction temperatures (250 °C) favor glycerol conversion and 1,2-propanediol yield. Under the optimum operating conditions (t = 1 h, T = 250 °C, Cgly = 4 wt%, 2.0 MPa N2, wcat = 0.5 g), glycerol is converted by 68.1%, showing 27.8% yield to 1,2-propanediol (40.9% selectivity)."
8,Efficiency of H2 donors,"3.3 Efficiency of H2 donors Before the evaluation of each H2 donor in glycerol hydrodeoxygenation reaction, preliminary tests using plain aqueous solution of H2 donors were conducted. These tests aimed to determine the reactivity of each compound in the absence of glycerol from the feed. All the experiments took place at 250 °C, over 0.5 g Cu:Zn:Al, using equimolar concentration (66 mmol) of each H2 donor. Table 3 presents the consumption rate of the individual compounds, the formation rate of hydrogen, the selectivity of each donor to H2 and the standard Gibbs energy of dehydrogenation or reforming reactions. The total number of the formed H2 moles were calculated based on the products detected in each experiment and the stoichiometry of their respective reactions. The consumption rate and the conversion of hydrogen donors increases with the following order: ethylene glycol < methanol < 1-butanol < 2-butanol < tert-butanol < ethanol < 2-propanol < formic acid < 1-propanol. Except tert-butanol, hydrogen production was feasible, with the hydrogen formation rate to increase as follows: tert-butanol < ethylene glycol << 1-butanol < ethanol ˜ 1-propanol ˜ 2-butanol < 2-propanol << formic acid < methanol. H2 is formed via reformation of methanol and formic acid or via dehydrogenation of the other H2 donors. The standard Gibbs energies, ΔG˚R in Table 3 qualitatively correlate with H2 formation rate and the thermodynamics of each reaction. Dehydrogenation reactions is thermodynamically less favored (ΔG˚R = 20–30 kJ/mol) than reforming reactions (ΔG˚R = −43.5 to −3.5 kJ/mol), as the dehydrogenation products have lower negative Gibbs energies of formation. Methanol and formic acid are the most selective donors to H2. The very high H2 selectivity (150%) of methanol is expected as one third of it derives from the water participating in the water gas shift reaction which is also promoted under the reaction conditions. Despite the low consumption rate of methanol (32.0 mmol H2 gcat −1 h−1), it is entirely consumed in the reforming reaction, presenting a carbon to gas conversion (CtG) equal to 24% and H2 production rate equal to 95.8 mmol H2 gcat −1 h−1. In literature, the aqueous phase methanol reforming reaction has been studied using fix bed and batch reactors, at temperatures between 80–230 °C, over noble metal (Pt, Ir) and Ni catalysts [14,45–48]. The H2 formation rate reported ranges between 3.6·10-2 and 5.0 mmol H2 gcat −1 h-1 and the CtG between 4.9 and 41.7%, with the best result reported for Ni-Ce/Al2O3 catalyst, at 230 °C [46]. The increased production rate of H2 (compared to literature data) is probably due to the higher reaction temperature (250 °C) which favors the endothermic reforming (ΔH = 50 kJ/mol) as well as to the presence of the copper catalyst which favors CO and CH bond scission reactions. In contrast to methanol, formic acid reacts faster to H2, CO2 and CO, showing 88 mmol H2 ∙gcat −1 h−1 H2 formation rate, equal to its corresponding consumption rate (Table 3, entry 2). Ethylene glycol (Table 3, entry 3) shows satisfactory selectivity to H2, however, its low consumption rate (11.7 mmol gcat -1 h-1) does not allow the production of higher amounts of H2 (11.9 mmol H2 gcat -1 h-1). Most likely, the Cu:Zn:Al catalyst and the type of reactor used, did not favor ethylene glycol conversion (8.8% conversion), as the majority of the works that study hydrogen formation from ethylene glycol have been conducted over Pt and Ni based catalysts, using fix bed reactors [49]. The selectivity to H2 of the alcohols with higher number of C atoms is much lower, because of their simultaneous consumption (like, dehydration, etherification, condensation reactions) to hydrocarbons formation. Ethanol shows low selectivity to H2, as large part of it is consumed to heavier products like diethylether, butanol etc (eq. 7–15 SI). Focusing on H2 formation rate of propanols (1- and 2-propanol) and butanols (1- and 2-butanol), it seems that secondary alcohols present higher activity to dehydrogenation reactions and higher selectivity to H2, than primary alcohols. Upon alcohol dehydrogenation, two H atoms are removed from alcohol’s molecule, one from the OH group and the other one from the C attached to OH (α-hydrogen) [50]. In the presence of a suitable hydrogen acceptor, secondary alcohols are dehydrogenated forming hydrogen and ketone. In the absence of a hydrogen acceptor, alcohol may follow various reaction routes like dehydrogenation, dehydration, reductive coupling and disproportionation [16]. An α-hydrogen of a primary alcohol is less likely to react as a hydride species, than that of a secondary alcohol, because of the smaller electron-releasing inductive effect of one alkyl group as against two [16]. Tertiary alcohols, like tert-butanol, having no α-hydrogen atoms, do not show any activity on H2 production, instead, they are more prone to condensation reactions forming ethers. More details about the possible reactions taking place in the presence of an aqueous solution of H2 donor as a feed are given in SI."
9,Effect of glycerol on H2 donor conversion,"3.4 Effect of glycerol on H2 donor conversion The effect of glycerol on conversion of each H2 donor, was investigated at 250 °C, for 1 h reaction time, using aqueous solution of 66 mmol H2 donor and 13 mmol glycerol as feedstock. Glycerol and H2 donor conversion, together with the corresponding ones obtained in the absence of glycerol are tabulated in Table 4 . The addition of glycerol in the feed has a significantly negative effect on methanol’s and 1-propanol’s conversion, which decrease by 86.8% and 53.3%, respectively. The observed decrease in methanol conversion can be attributed to the competitive adsorption between the two reactants on the same active sites, with the stronger adsorption of glycerol suppressing methanol conversion [36]. Despite the low methanol conversion in the combined reaction cycle, the produced hydrogen is mainly formed via methanol reforming as it was proved by conducting hydrodeoxygenation tests using labeled 13CH3OH [36]. Similarly, in the case of 1-propanol, a weaker adsorption of 1-propanol compared to that of glycerol, on the same catalytic sites could be assumed. On the other hand, the conversion of ethanol, 2-butanol and tert-butanol show a remarkable increase with the addition of glycerol. At the same time the carbon balance of both glycerol and H2 donors decreases. It is common for glycols like glycerol to react with alcohols (ethanol, tert-butanol, 1-propanol, 1-octanol etc) forming ethers [51,52]."
10,Effect H2 donor on glycerol hydrodeoxygenation,"3.5 Effect H2 donor on glycerol hydrodeoxygenation The effect of H2 donor on glycerol hydrodeoxygenation was investigated varying H2 donor concentration, at 250 °C, for 1 h reaction time, keeping constant the initial concentration of glycerol (13 mmol). Figs. 3, 5 & 6 present glycerol conversion, 1,2-propanediol yield and H2 formation rate, as a function of H2 donor/glycerol molar ratio (0–20.5). Lower range of molar ratio (from 0.5 to 5.5) was tested only in the case of formic acid. As it is shown in Fig. 3 , the addition and the increase of H2 donor concentration do not negatively affect glycerol conversion. The only exceptions are formic acid and ethylene glycol. The addition of low amounts of formic acid in the feed (molformic acid / molglycerol = 0.5–1) results in an increase by 10% on glycerol conversion. However, using higher formic acid concentration glycerol conversion decreases. The negative impact of increased formic acid concentration on glycerol conversion could be attributed to competitive adsorption between glycerol and formic acid on the same active sites. The faster adsorption of formic acid compared to glycerol, inhibits glycerol adsorption on catalytic surface and subsequently its conversion. Similar results regarding the effect of formic acid on glycerol conversion were also observed by Gandarias et al. [30]. In order to eliminate the effects of the competitive adsorption, they carried out hydrodeoxygenation tests using a semi-continuous reactor, in which the formic acid was gradually added in the feed. Similar to formic acid, ethylene glycol addition in the feed (molethylene glycol / molglycerol = 1.8), causes a reduction on glycerol conversion by 26.4%, while a further increase in molar ratio up to 20.5, has no effect on glycerol conversion, presenting a zero order dependence on ethylene glycol concentration, (Fig. 3). On the other hand, the presence of glycerol in the feed does not significantly affect ethylene glycol conversion (Table 4, entry 4). The Fig. 4 shows the weight loss as a function of temperature for the spent catalyst after the experiment using as a feed : A) aq. solution of 4 wt% glycerol and ethylene glycol (molar ratio glycerol/ethylene glycol = 1.8), B) aq. solution of 4 wt% glycerol as well as the fresh reduced CuZnAl catalyst (for comparison reasons). Focusing on catalyst A, the initial weight loss (˜1.6% of the initial weight) up to 200 °C is assigned mainly to water loss. From 200 °C to 365 °C a weight increase is observed due to copper reoxidation (Cu° or Cu2O to CuO), justifying by the weight profile of the fresh reduced sample. However, the weight of the used A catalyst increases only by 2.7% (compared to the corresponding of the fresh reduced that increases by 12%), most likely due to simultaneous removal of the strongly adsorbed components (reactants and/or products) from the catalyst surface. Obviously the formation of these species is favored by the presence of ethylene glycol, as indicate the higher weight loss of the catalyst A compared to the catalyst B. At higher temperatures the catalyst weight remains practically constant, revealing the absence of carbonaceous deposits (coke). Based on the above, the reduction on glycerol conversion could be attributed to the competitive adsorption phenomena between glycerol and these strongly adsorbed species on catalyst surface [53]. These species may be ethylene glycol itself and/or various adsorbed species formed via various reactions of ethylene glycol, and may negatively affect the catalyst performance during the HDO reaction by blocking the active catalytic sites and preventing glycerol adsorption. The formation of 1,2-propanediol is feasible in the presence of all compounds used in this study. Figures S1-S9 depict glycerol conversion and the selectivity to HDO products as a function of molar ratio, for each H2 donor. The increase of H2 donor concentration in the feed, does not affect the HDO products distribution, with 1,2-propanediol as the major product, followed by hydroxyacetone. Figs. 5 and 6 present the variation of 1,2-propanediol yield and H2 formation rate for all the H2 donors, as a function of molar ratio (molH2 donor / molglycerol). The corresponding data obtained using plain glycerol are also included at zero point of x axis. By increasing donor concentration in the feed, H2 formation rate increases, leading to higher 1,2-propanediol yields. The higher H2 availability, not only favors the hydrogenation rate of hydroxyacetone, but also inhibits the side glycerol’s reactions thus promoting glycerol HDO. This is valid for most of H2 donors. Therefore, the highest molar ratio mol H2 donor / mol glycerol = 20.5 used was proved the most effective for 1,2-propanediol yield. However, ethylene glycol, formic acid and tert-butanol behave differently achieving better results for lower molar ratios equal to 1.8, 1 and 5.1, respectively. In addition, in the case of 2-propanol, the yield (59.6%) obtained using mol2-propanol / molglycerol = 20.5 was comparable to that obtained using mol2-propanol / molglycerol = 10.9 (58.5%). Hence, the mol2-propanol / molglycerol = 10.9 was chosen as the optimum ratio for 2-propanol. Fig. 7 presents the optimum results of the combined reaction cycle for each donor (including glycerol), expressed as glycerol conversion and 1,2-propanediol yield. Glycerol conversion ranges between 50–96% and increases with the following order: ethylene glycol < glycerol < formic acid ≈ tert-butanol < 1-propanol < 2-propanol < ethanol < 1-butanol ≈ methanol ≈ 2-butanol. In parallel, 1,2-propanediol yield ranges between 26.3–74% and increases as follows: tert-butanol ≈ glycerol < ethylene glycol < formic acid < 1-propanol ≈ 2-butanol ≈ ethanol < 1-butanol < 2-propanol < methanol. The same trend is also observed for the intrinsic rates (TOF) of glycerol consumption and 1,2-propanediol formation, which ranges between 9.39–18.20 h−1 and 5.23–13.91 h−1, (Table S1, SI). The relationship between 1,2-propanediol and hydrogen is clearly shown in Fig. 8 which combines 1,2-propanediol mmoles as a function of the total mmoles of H2 formed using the optimum molar ratio for each H2 donor. The linear dependence demonstrates that the high availability of hydrogen is the key factor for achieving high 1,2-propanediol yield, regardless the source of the hydrogen. Methanol was proved the best H2 donor, with 95.8% glycerol conversion and 74% 1,2-propanediol yield (77.2% selectivity), followed by 2-propanol that showed similar activity and 58.5% 1,2-propanediol yield (68.9% selectivity). The values of glycerol conversion and 1,2-propanediol yield that were obtained using methanol as H2 donor are comparable to that obtained with external H2 addition at 8.0 MPa [37], indicating the superiority of the combined reaction cycle. In addition, compared to catalytic systems evaluated in glycerol HDO under inert initial conditions (Table 1), the presence of methanol results in at least 2.5 times higher productivity to 1,2-propanediol (1.465 kg1,2-PDO kgcat −1 h−1), demonstrating its effectiveness as H2 donor. Worthy to note that, due to different experimental parameters that were used by the various research groups in the literature, the direct comparison between the achieved results is not easy. For that reason, 1,2-propanediol productivity was chosen as a benchmark in order to compare the results presented in the present manuscript with the corresponding achieved in the literature. 2-propanol’s productivity to 1,2-propanediol (1.16 kg1,2-PDO kgcat −1 h−1) is also commendable. Worthy to note that Cu:Zn:Al catalyst used, shows superior performance in the presence of all H2 donors, achieving high yields to 1,2-propanediol for short reaction time (1 h). Despite the low methanol conversion, the amounts of H2 and 1,2-propanediol mmoles that are formed in the present of methanol are higher compared to the other donors (Fig. 8). As it is shown in Table 3(entries 1&2, tests with donor and water as a feed), methanol together with formic acid, proved the most selective compounds to H2. The advantage of methanol compared to the rest alcohols lies in the fact that methanol reforming intermediates react faster and more readily to hydrogen giving three times the moles of H2 that are formed via the dehydrogenation of the rest alcohols. Formic acid could be considered as the most efficient molecule for H2 production, since a comparable amount of H2 is produced, using almost four times lower acid concentration in the feed, (Fig. 6). However, as a H2 donor in glycerol hydrodeoxygenation, formic acid shows moderate performance (39.8% yield in 1,2-propanediol), as its high consumption rate inhibits glycerol conversion. The negative effect of formic acid concentration on glycerol conversion and 1,2-propanediol selectivity is more pronounced at higher molar ratio molformic acid /molglycerol 5.5. Under these conditions glycerol converts only by 33.7% with 9% selectivity to 1,2-propanediol (Figure S2, SI). In this case, despite the high H2 availability, the majority of the atomic hydrogen that is formed directly on the active sites is not consumed by glycerol or intermediates, but is desorbed as molecular H2 in the gas phase. Moreover, almost 30% of the reactant glycerol is consumed in undesired parallel routes. It is possible that glycerol reacts either with formic acid or CO2 forming products such as allyl alcohol (prop-2-en-1-ol) and glycerol carbonate [54,55]. The low 1,2-propanediol yield that was obtained using ethylene glycol as H2 donor, is related both to inhibition effect of ethylene glycol on glycerol adsorption on the active sites, and to the lower H2 formation rate under the applied reaction conditions. Even thought, H2 formation rate increases with the increase of ethylene glycol concentration, similar to formic acid, the majority of the formed hydrogen is not consumed for HDO reaction but it is adsorbed as molecular H2. 2-propanol is one of the most widely used H2 donors [56–58] and one of the first H2 donors (together with ethanol) that was tested in glycerol hydrodeoxygenation [27,29,31]. As it is shown from Figure S5 in SI the effect of 2-propanol concentration on HDO products selectivity is more significant for ratios mol2-propanol / molglycerol > 5.1, because of the larger extent of 2-propanol dehydrogenation reaction. The main consumption reactions of 2-propanol are, its dehydrogenation to hydrogen and acetone (eq. 16, SI) and its dehydration to propylene (eq.17, SI). The latter in a next step hydrogenates to propane (eq.18, SI). Based on 2-propanol’s selectivity to acetone, propane and propylene (Fig. 9 ), it is suggested that the extent of 2-propanol dehydrogenation reaction depends on the initial 2-propanol /glycerol molar ratio. Solutions with high 2-propanol concentration (mol2-propanol / molglycerol > 10.9) favor mostly the dehydrogenation reaction, while the more dilute in propanol (mol2-propanol / molglycerol < 10.9) favor 2-propanol dehydration reaction (Fig. 9). In any case, part of the hydrogen, produced via dehydrogenation of 2-propanol, is consumed to propane production. The moderate performance of 1-propanol as H2 donor can be attributed to its low selectivity to H2 (Table 3, entry 5) and to the inhibition effect of glycerol on 1-propanol conversion (Table 4, entry 5). The results of the variation of 1-propanol’s concentration on glycerol HDO showed that in order for the contribution of 1-propanol to H2 production to be substantial, its molar amount should be at least 20 times higher than that of glycerol. However, with the increase of 1-propanol concentration in the feed, in parallel with the H2 formation, its extent to hydrocarbon formation reactions becomes dominant. As it is shown in Figs. 3 & 6 , the increase of ethanol and butanols concentration in the feed led to higher H2 formation rates and to almost complete glycerol conversion. However, in that case only a small portion of the formed H2 is consumed to HDO reaction, keeping the selectivity to the desired diol at moderate levels (Figures S4, S7, S8, SI). As it was mentioned above, ethanol favors glycerol consumption to more volatile products like monosubstituted (3-ethoxy-propane-1,2-diol, 2-ethoxy-propane-1,3-diol), disubstituted (1,3-diethoxy-propane-2-ol, 2,3-diethoxy-propane-1-ol) and trisubstituted (1,2,3-triethoxy-propane) ethers [59]. The extent of glycerol condensation reactions increases with the increase of butanols concentration in the feed. This is mainly due to low water concentration in the feed (4 wt% glycerol + 78 wt% 2-butanol + 18 wt% H2O) which promotes this type of reactions, in agreement with the results observed using denser glycerol solution (Fig. 2C). Despite the sufficient H2 availability in the reaction system (produced via butanol’s dehydrogenation), only a small portion of the formed H2 is consumed in the reactions leading to the desired diol, maintaining the selectivity to 1,2-propanediol at the same levels (Figures S7 & S8, SI). Finally, the lower yield of 1,2-propanediol similar to that obtained using glycerol reforming as hydrogen source, was achieved in the presence of the tertiary alcohol. The reduced ability of the tert -butanol for hydrogen production renders it an inefficient H2 donor. In addition, similarly to the other butanols, the increase of tert-butanol concentration favors glycerol conversion to unknown products, resulting in a decrease in HDO products selectivity (Figure S9, SI)."
11,Conclusions,"This work deals with the one–step production of 1,2-propanediol via glycerol hydrodeoxygenation, under initial inert conditions. The reaction was studied in liquid phase using water as solvent, over Cu:Zn:Al catalyst. Using bare glycerol aqueous solution, it was found that the main reaction product is 1,2-propanediol. This implies that glycerol serves as hydrogen donor most probably via aqueous phase reforming route. Under the optimum operating conditions (4 wt% aqueous solution of glycerol, mglycerol/mcatalyst = 2.4, 250 °C, 1 h), glycerol is converted by 68.1%, with 27.8% yield (40.9% selectivity) to 1,2-propanediol. Several compounds like methanol, formic acid, ethanol, ethylene glycol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol and tert- butanol were examined for their ability to act as H2 donors. Except for tert-butanol, all the other bio-compounds presented significant rates to H2 formation. Interesting results were obtained when tested in mixture with glycerol. The catalytic results of the combined reaction cycle of glycerol hydrodeoxygenation – H2 donor reforming/dehydrogenation, depend on the nature of the H2 donor compound. The presence in the feed and the increase of H2 donor concentration enhances both the activity and the target product yield, with no effect on the distribution of the hydrodeoxygenation products. Negative effect on glycerol conversion and 1,2-propanediol yield, was observed with the addition of ethylene glycol and formic acid in the feed. Due to their stronger adsorption on catalyst surface, compared to glycerol, the presence of these two compounds inhibits the conversion of glycerol, leading to lower yields. In the presence of ethanol, 1-butanol and 2-butanol, glycerol conversion is enhanced but not towards the target product. The presence of these donors in the feed favors glycerol condensation reactions or reactions between donors and glycerol. Methanol was proved the best H2 donor, showing 95.8% glycerol conversion and 74% 1,2-propanediol yield (77.2% selectivity), followed by 2-propanol. Although glycerol conversion in the presence of both donors was almost complete, 2-propanol resulted in lower 1,2-propanediol yield due to its lower selectivity to H2. Formic acid also presented encouraging results, as its activity in the catalytic hydrogen transfer is favored by low molformic acid / molglycerol ratios. In general, small molecules such as methanol and formic acid are more selective to H2 in contrast to alcohols with higher number of carbon atoms. Their low selectivity is ascribed to high extent of parallel consumption routes like dehydration, condensation and etherification."
