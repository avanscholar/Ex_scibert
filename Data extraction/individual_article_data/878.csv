0,Introduction,"The dependence on diminishing non-renewable petroleum resources and their adverse effects on the environment such as greenhouse gases and other toxic pollutant compounds are driving the advancement of new clean energy sources (Bundhoo et al., 2015). To alleviate issues related to fossil fuel use, considerable efforts have been made to search for an alternate sustainable energy source. Hydrogen is one of the cleanest fuel sources with high energy content (142 MJ/kg) as compared to other hydrocarbon fuels (Arimi et al., 2015; Kumar et al., 2016). Owing to the advantages of hydrogen as a fuel, the South Korean government proclaimed a venture for hydrogen economy targets at industrializing 6.2 million hydrogen vehicles by next 20 years (https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20190117000468). Presently, 96% of the global hydrogen is chiefly produced from fossil fuels whereas 4% of hydrogen is generated from electrolysis of water (Das et al., 2014; Kadier et al., 2016). Numerous biological approaches have been explored for hydrogen production utilizing agricultural leftover, crop residues, etc. through dark fermentation (Lin et al., 2016) and photofermentation pathways (Azwar et al., 2014; Morsy, 2017; Li et al., 2020). Still, biohydrogen production is not yet realistic due to several constraints associated with the process. Biophotolysis process comprises hydrogen production through sunlight energy conversion, but costly bioreactor, slow hydrogen production rates, etc. confine its practical application (Das et al., 2014). Furthermore, hydrogen production through dark fermentation offers comparatively simple process, and the exploitation of the various feedstocks makes them striking method for the clean and sustainable hydrogen production (Rittmann and Herwig, 2012). Nowadays, owing to the increasing intake of starch food materials in the diet, the utilization of generated waste starch materials/residues has gained an attention to a greater extent. A potato-based starch factory with annual starch production of 10 kiloton discharges large amounts of waste (~900 ton) per day every year. Besides, the residual potato waste releases methane as they turn rotten since they comprise ample polysaccharides, proteins, etc. (Fang et al., 2011) which creates a severe problem of environmental pollution. Hence, there is a need to develop environmentally friendly process which can directly convert starch-based waste biomass materials into chemicals and fuels. Starch-based substrates are carbohydrate-rich compounds, which can be exploited for hydrogen production using amylase-secreting hydrogen producer strains. The Parageobacillus thermoglucosidasius strain is well known as a producer of thermostable α-amylase (Saeed et al., 2021) with the ability to utilize hexose and pentose sugars and starch for generating biofuels such as hydrogen (Mohr et al., 2019). On account of the recognized amylase activity of this strain, we assumed that hydrogen fermentation process could be established even from raw starch using this strain. Assuming that the generated potato residue is suitable substrate for hydrogen production, still there are hardly any research studies reported using starch-based biomass feedstocks. Hitit et al. (2017) reported 8.3 mmol of hydrogen/chemical oxygen demand (COD) using mixture of glucose and potato starch through multi-step anaerobic fermentation process. In the present study, hydrogen production in one step was attempted through dark fermentation utilizing potato peel waste biomass (PWB) by thermophillic amylase producer Parageobacillus thermoglucosidasius KCTC 33548 strain. The foremost hurdle for commercializing the hydrogen technology is low yields, which is due to the generation of organic acids, alcohols, and soluble metabolites during hydrogen fermentation (Sivagurunathan et al., 2016). Numerous attempts have been directed towards improving the performance of anaerobic microbial strains by including some carrier, trace elements (Zhang et al., 2013; Luo et al., 2015) and through metabolic bioengineering approach for overexpressing hydrogenase genes (Zhang et al., 2011). Nowadays, the swift growth in nanomaterial application has improved the biofuel process efficiency. For hydrogen producing microbial strains, the use of nanoparticles (NPs) triggers the bioactivity of microbes due to their special physicochemical properties. Stimulation of bioactivity is mainly facilitated by electron–electron transport (Lin et al., 2016) and modification of hydrogenase gene expression levels (Hsieh et al., 2016). The addition of miniscule amount of metal ions such as Zn, Fe, Ni, etc. is crucial for overall microbial growth and its metabolic activities (Budiman and Wu, 2018). Amidst metal ions, Fe is usually preferred owing to its prospective as a stimulator for hydrogen generation which is linked with ferredoxin present in the enzyme as an electron carrier (Budiman and Wu, 2018). Among the various studied NPs, Fe3O4 NPs which hold super paramagnetic, biocompatible, and high co-reactivity properties can expedite the electron transfer rate during hydrogen production (Tiang et al., 2020). The impact of Fe3O4 NPs on hydrogen yields, enhanced hydrogenase activities, and the trend of electron transfer during hydrogen production process have not been explored till date. The present study reports the effect of Fe3O4 NPs on hydrogenase activities and hydrogen generation from glucose, pure starch, and starch-based biomass waste using amylase producing strain, P. thermoglucosidasius. The use of cheap and renewable carbohydrate resources for hydrogen production is almost carbon–neutral process and it may unravel drawbacks such as hydrogen yield, storage, and the associated safety concerns. Based on the reported scientific information and technical accomplishments, the carbohydrate-driven vehicles could become reality with rigorous R&D efforts in the upcoming times. To our knowledge, there are no such studies reported on the improved conversion of starch-based PWB into hydrogen using Fe3O4 NPs and their correlation with hydrogenase activities expressed by P. thermoglucosidasius under anaerobic dark fermentation conditions at 55 °C. Hence, the present study attempted to assess the influence of Fe3O4 NPs on hydrogen production using starch biomass and the mechanism of action at enhanced levels of hydrogen production. To attain this objective, the impact of various concentrations of Fe3O4 NPs on hydrogen production from glucose was initially studied. Further, the improvement in hydrogen production using PWB was evaluated using optimized concentration of Fe3O4 NPs. The modified Gompertz model was employed to examine the kinetic parameters of hydrogen production from glucose and starch substrates. The ultimate aim of the current study is to develop a commercially viable hydrogen production process using cheaper substrates and improving hydrogen yields. In this study, PWB was used as a substrate which is abundantly available waste material generated by the starch industry in large amounts, to significantly reduce substrate cost. Another aspect was to enhance the level of hydrogen production using Fe3O4 NPs. The inclusion of Fe3O4 NPs improved hydrogen production by 4.15-fold, which is one of the highlights of the current study. Further, the correlation of hydrogenase gene expression was elucidated in the presence of Fe3O4 NPs and accordingly the mechanism of action of Fe3O4 NPs on hydrogen production was discussed. Overall, this process can be an emerging approach for biorefinery applications to valorize starch-based waste residues generated from food processing/agriculture, etc. This study proposes new perceptions into the promising application of P. thermoglucosidasius strain for large-scale hydrogen production using starch biomass feedstocks."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Initially, PWB was washed and then oven dried at 50 °C overnight followed by grinding to obtain PWB powder. This powder was stored in a container till further use. Dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) and Folin-Ciocalteau reagent were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Hydrogen peroxide, ammonia solution (25–30%), potato starch, and dextrose were obtained from Samchun Chemicals, Korea. Ferrous chloride (FeCl2) and ferric chloride (FeCl3) were purchased from Junsei Chemicals, Japan."
3,Synthesis and characterization of magnetic iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles,"2.2 Synthesis and characterization of magnetic iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles Fe3O4 NPs were synthesized by mixing 1 M FeCl2 with 3 M FeCl3 in deionized water as previously reported (Maharjan et al., 2020). The synthesis of Fe3O4 NPs was confirmed by characterization using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. The morphology of Fe3O4 NPs was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. Further, to determine the crystallinity and thermal stability of Fe3O4 NPs, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were conducted, respectively. The magnetic characteristic of NPs was determined by the vibrating-sample magnetometer technique."
4,"Microbial strain, medium, and incoculum preparation","2.3 Microbial strain, medium, and incoculum preparation Parageobacillus thermoglucosidasius KCTC 33548 was obtained from Korean Collection for Type Cultures (KCTC). P. thermoglucosidasius was cultivated in growth medium containing 10 g/L soluble starch, 5 g/L peptone, 3 g/L malt extract, 3 g/L yeast extract, and 3 g/L K2HPO4. The strain was maintained in glycerol stock at −80 °C. The fermentation medium for hydrogen production consisted of 5 g/L peptone, 3 g/L yeast extract, 1.5 g/L NaCl, 1 mL/L stock solution (1.05 M nitrilotriacetic acid, 0.91 M CaCl2·2H2O, and 0.59 M MgSO4·7H2O). Various carbon sources such as glucose, pure starch, and PWB were used at different concentrations for hydrogen production. For inoculum development, a 50 µL of P. thermoglucosidasius glycerol stock was inoculated in the growth medium (50 mL) and incubated anaerobically at 55 °C with shaking at 150 rpm. After 24 h, 5% (v/v) inoculum was added to a stoppered serum bottle (125 mL) containing 50 mL fermentation medium. All experiments were performed till 96 h in triplicates."
5,Hydrogen fermentation,"2.4 Hydrogen fermentation All preliminary optimization studies to investigate the effect of temperature, pH, concentration of Fe3O4 NPs and L-cysteine were performed using 10 g/L glucose as carbon source in serum bottles (125 mL) containing 50 mL fermentation medium. 2.4.1 Effect of temperature and pH on hydrogen production The effect of temperature and pH on hydrogen production by P. thermoglucosidasius were studied using 10 g/L glucose in the fermentation medium. P. thermoglucosidasius cells were grown at various temperatures (50, 55, and 60 °C) in the fermentation medium of various pHs (4.5, 6.5, and 8.0). 2.4.2 Effect of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and L-cysteine on hydrogen production For hydrogen fermentation experiment, various concentrations of Fe3O4 NPs (0, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 mg/L) and L-cysteine (0, 50, 150, 250, 350, 450, and 550 mg/L) were added to the medium. The pH of the fermentation medium was set at 6.5 and all inoculated flasks were incubated at 55 °C. To circumvent the oxidation of Fe3O4 NPs and increase the solubility of reagents, fermentation medium was purged using nitrogen gas before adding reagents. Each experiment was performed in triplicates to confirm the precision of the obtained outcomes. During the hydrogen fermentation process, the concentration of hydrogen and other metabolic products were measured every 12 h. On the basis of achieved results, the best condition for each parameter exhibiting the maximum hydrogen production rate was chosen, i.e. 55 °C, pH 6.0, Fe3O4 300 mg/L, and L-cysteine 350 mg/L. To study the permutation of the optimized parameters exhibiting higher hydrogen concentration, further experiments were performed using starch substrates. 2.4.3 Hydrogen production using pure starch and raw potato peel waste biomass substrate Initial studies on direct starch fermentation by P. thermoglucosidasius strain were performed in serum bottle (125 mL) containing 50 mL of sterilized fermentation medium (as mentioned above) supplemented with 25 g/L of potato starch and raw PWB powder as carbon source. To attain higher hydrogen production levels using starch substrates, the optimized concentrations of Fe3O4 (300 mg/L) and L-cysteine (350 mg/L) were supplemented to the fermentation medium. All inoculated bottles were incubated under anaerobic conditions at pH 6.5 and 55 °C with shaking at 150 rpm in dark condition. Further, main batch fermentations were carried out in 500 mL bottle with the working volume of 200 mL of fermentation medium supplemented with 25 g/L of potato starch powder and raw PWB substrates. One mL fermented broth sample was removed at regular time intervals from the serum bottles using a sterile syringe to determine soluble metabolic products content using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. All experiments were conducted at least in triplicates."
6,Hydrogenase and amylase activity determination,"2.5 Hydrogenase and amylase activity determination P. thermoglucosidasius cells grown in the optimized fermentation medium were collected at different time intervals and then the harvested cells were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was treated with lysozyme–ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to obtain membrane vesicles through osmotic lysis in high sugar concentration (Blbulyan and Trchounian, 2015). The osmotically lysed cells were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min to separate cell debris and membranes from the soluble protein fraction. The supernatant containing soluble protein was used for cytoplasmic soluble hydrogenase and the membrane pellet was used for membrane-associated hydrogenase activity measurements. Hydrogenase activity of membrane-associated fraction and whole cells were measured by observing the reduction of methylene blue at 570 nm with a UV–visible spectrophotometer. Approximately 10 μL of whole cells or cell extracts was added to the 2.0 mL reaction system containing phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and methylene blue (Lenz et al., 2018). The hydrogenase activity of cytoplasmic soluble fraction was determined using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as the electron acceptor under anaerobic conditions at a wavelength of 365 nm using a UV–visible spectrophotometer. One unit of enzyme activity was expressed as the amount of enzyme required to catalyse 1 μmol of substrate (hydrogen) per min (Jugder et al., 2015; Lenz et al., 2018). Protein concentration was measured as per bicinchoninic acid protocol using bovine serum albumin as standard (Jugder et al., 2015). Amylase activity was determined according to the Miller method using 1% starch substrate as described by Ballschmiter et al. (2006)."
7,Zymogram staining of hydrogenase isoforms,"2.6 Zymogram staining of hydrogenase isoforms Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE, 10%) was performed using the electrophoresis technique designated by Laemmli (1970) and gels were stained for hydrogenase activity with respect to the direct method described by Garvie (1969). Native PAGE was performed at pH 8.3 using 10% acrylamide as resolving gel with 5% stacking gel. P. thermoglucosidasius cells grown in hydrogen fermentation medium with and without Fe3O4 NPs were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Then, the harvested cells were washed with an equal volume of Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.0). Further, cells were resuspended in the same buffer and sonicated under the same conditions used for hydrogenase activity determination (as described in the above section). After sonication, the obtained supernatant containing membrane fraction samples (~50 μg of protein) were applied in sample wells and electrophoresed at a constant voltage of 120 V for 3 h. After electrophoresis at pH 8.3, the hydrogenase enzymes were located by immersing the gel in a solution consisting of 50.0 mg of NAD+, 10.0 mg of nitro-blue tetrazolium, 2.0 mg of phenazine methosulphate in Tris-HCl buffer. Hydrogenase activity staining was performed by constant flushing the gel with hydrogen gas until the activity bands appeared (Ballantine and Boxer, 1986)."
8,Kinetic parameter analysis by modified Gompertz model,"2.7 Kinetic parameter analysis by modified Gompertz model Cumulative hydrogen production was determined using a modified Gompertz model as described in Eq. (1), which is commonly used to evaluate the kinetic parameters of hydrogen production experiments. (1) H t = H max e x p - e x p R max e H max λ - t + 1 where H(t) is the cumulative hydrogen production (mL) at time t, Hmax is the maximum hydrogen production (mL), Rmax is the maximum hydrogen production rate (mL/h), λ is the lag phase (h), t is the incubation time (h), and e is the Euler's number (e = 2.71828) (Wang and Wan, 2009). The average hydrogen production rate (R) can be expressed using the equation (2). (2) R = H ( t ) λ + H ( t ) / R max"
9,Analytical methods,"2.8 Analytical methods Total carbohydrate concentration was estimated by the colorimetric technique as reported by Dubois et al. (1956). The concentration of crude protein was determined from total Kjeldahl nitrogen using 6.25 as the conversion factor. Lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose contents were measured as per the analytical methods reported by Sluiter et al. (2011). Starch concentration was estimated by quantifying the glucose generated after starch saccharification using amylase by the Miller method (Gao et al., 2012). To estimate the ash content, a 1.0 g sample was heated at 600 °C for 6 h to obtain a constant weight. The fermented broth sample was taken from the serum bottles using a sterile needle and syringe. Cell growth of P. thermoglucosidasius during hydrogen fermentation was monitored using a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) at a wavelength of 660 nm (Zheng et al., 2019). To measure the hydrogen composition, a 1 mL gas sample was taken from the headspace of the bottle using a sterile syringe and injected into gas chromatography (GC, GOW-MAC, Series 580) attached to a thermal conductivity detector. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas for the analysis, and its flow velocity was fixed at 15 mL/min at a column temperature of 50 °C. The temperatures of detector and injector were set at 90 and 80 °C, respectively. All samples were centrifuged and the obtained supernatant was analysed for metabolic products generated during hydrogen fermentation using an HPLC system (Young-Lin, Inc., Korea) as previously reported (Zheng et al., 2019). COD was measured according to the standard method (Rodger and Bridgewater, 2017)."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Biochemical composition of potato peel waste biomass,"3.1 Biochemical composition of potato peel waste biomass The chemical composition of PWB was examined to evaluate its viability for hydrogen production. Dry PWB was composed of 53.1 ± 2.29% (w/w) starch, 21.1 ± 1.17% cellulose, 9.19 ± 0.41% pectin, 3.06 ± 0.50% lignin, and 1.98 ± 1.58% ash. It appears that some of the starch is removed during the starch processing industry and the content of pectin and cellulose in PWB increases. It has been deduced that pectin and cellulose components in PWB could form an intricate linkage to limit the agility of enzyme molecules which can affect abundantly on hydrogen production levels. These results suggest that concerning the maximum starch content (~53%), PWB is prospective raw substrate for hydrogen production."
12,Effect of physical parameters on hydrogen production,"3.2 Effect of physical parameters on hydrogen production Optimization of physical parameters, particularly pH and temperature, is essential to achieve the maximum concentration of the desired end product. As illustrated in Fig. 1 a, the maximum cell biomass (0.39 ± 0.018 g/L) was detected at 55 °C, followed by at 50 °C (0.37 ± 0.013 g/L) and 60 °C (0.23 ± 0.009 g/L) after 24 h of fermentation. The growth profile correlated well with the higher maximum cumulative hydrogen yield (31.9 ± 1.11 mL) obtained at 55 °C. At 50 °C, hydrogen production yield was slightly lower than at 55 °C. Considering these slight variations and the highest cell growth at 55 °C, this temperature was chosen for all experiments. Significant differences were also noticed when P. thermoglucosidasius was grown in fermentation media with different pH ranges of 4.5, 6.5, and 8.5. As depicted in Fig. 1b, the maximum cell biomass was observed at pH 6.5 (0.42 ± 0.011 g/L), while cell biomass was minimal at pH 8.5 (0.29 ± 0.0015 g/L). Cell growth rate at pH 6.5 was also higher than at other pHs, and correspondingly the maximum hydrogen production (29.2 ± 1.31 mL) was observed at pH 6.5. Based on the obtained highest yield and productivity of the process, pH 6.5 and temperature 55 °C were considered as the optimum condition for maximum hydrogen production."
13,Effects of Fe3O4 nanoparticles on cell growth and hydrogen production performance,"3.3 Effects of Fe3O4 nanoparticles on cell growth and hydrogen production performance The influence of Fe3O4 NPs (in the range of 0–500 mg/L) on hydrogen production using glucose substrate (10 g/L) is demonstrated in Fig. 2 a. The hydrogen yields steadily improved from 11.3 ± 0.53 mL for the control (without Fe3O4 NPs) to 46.9 ± 2.1 mL for 300 mg/L Fe3O4 NPs at 24 h. The maximum hydrogen production rate of 1.95 ± 0.03 mL/h was achieved after 24 h of fermentation using 300 mg/L Fe3O4 NPs. The supplementation of 300 mg/L Fe3O4 NPs enhanced hydrogen production levels by 4.15-fold in contrast to the control. The hydrogen yield was lowered when the Fe3O4 NP concentration increased above 300 mg/L. With further increasing Fe3O4 NP concentration (400 mg/L), the reduction in hydrogen yield (24.1 ± 1.21 mL) was observed, which might be toxic to P. thermoglucosidasius cells. As displayed in Fig. 2b, the biomass yield was higher than that of the control as Fe3O4 NP supplementation was increased up to 300 mg/L. A cell biomass of 0.78 g/L was recorded as the highest when the optimum concentration of Fe3O4 NPs (300 mg/L) was employed during the hydrogen fermentation process. The increase in biomass concentration was 2.22 times higher than the control (0.35 mg/L). However, higher concentrations of Fe3O4 (>300 mg/L) affected cell growth negatively, causing cell death due to oxidative stress (Gadhe et al., 2015). Consequently, it can be concluded that an appropriate concentration of NPs stimulated the growth of P. thermoglucosidasius cells and hydrogen production using glucose, whereas surplus addition of Fe3O4 NPs revealed inhibition of P. thermoglucosidasius cells and decreased hydrogen production. Fig. 2c presents the data related to the effect of Fe3O4 NPs on soluble metabolic products generated during hydrogen fermentation using glucose substrate. Mainly, acetic acid, ethanol, formic acid, and lactic acid were formed as metabolic products. The increased concentration of Fe3O4 NPs (300 mg/L) accelerated acetic acid formation (Fig. 2c). At the optimum concentration (300 mg/L) of Fe3O4 NPs, the total concentration of metabolic products increased considerably in comparison to the control. However, the ethanol yield decreased with increasing NP concentration, whereas the proportion of acetate increased at the optimum concentration of 300 mg/L NPs. NPs may possibly function as “channels” facilitating effectual electron transfer at extracellular level amongst associated microbial cells (Jiang et al., 2014). The addition of magnetite NPs improved the rate of electron transfer which enhanced levels of methane production (about 33%) (Cruz Viggi et al., 2014). It has been substantiated that the application of NPs at particular concentration enhanced hydrogen production levels but further increase in concentration of NPs repressed hydrogen fermentation due to oxidative stress (Mohanraj et al., 2014; Gadhe et al., 2015). As demonstrated in Fig. 2d, the control experiment exhibited the utmost oxidation reduction potential (ORP) values, whereas the addition of Fe3O4 NPs curtailed ORP values mostly due to the reduction by ferric/ferrous ions in the hydrogen fermentation medium (Reddy et al., 2017). After 24 h of fermentation, the lowest ORP were observed. As presented in Table 1 , the hydrogen production parameters were fitted using the modified Gompertz equation. Supplementation of Fe3O4 NPs during fermentation using glucose substrate generated higher amount of hydrogen than the control with Hmax and Rmax being increased up to 300 g/L Fe3O4 and then declined with increasing NP concentration. The maximum hydrogen production, Hmax was 45.9 mL with 300 mg/L Fe3O4 NPs, correlating well with the experimental value (46.2 ± 2.31 mL). From the obtained results, it has been substantiated that the inclusion of Fe3O4 NPs had striking influence on overall kinetics of hydrogen production."
14,Effect of L-cysteine on cell growth and hydrogen production performance,"3.4 Effect of L-cysteine on cell growth and hydrogen production performance L-cysteine is a growth promoting factor and is known to enhance nitrogenase and hydrogenase activities (Zhao et al., 2012). Therefore, the influence of various concentrations of L-cysteine on hydrogen production was studied using 10 g/L glucose as a substrate and presented in Fig. 3 a. As compared to the control experiment (i.e. without L-cysteine), supplementation of cysteine yielded higher titers of hydrogen. A maximum hydrogen production of 46.4 ± 2.11 mL was obtained at 250 mg/L L-cysteine. The hydrogen yield started to decline with increasing L-cysteine concentration above 250 mg/L, which might be attributable to the inhibition of metabolic pathway involved in hydrogen production. The maximum biomass yield and the associated hydrogen production profile using various concentrations of L-cysteine are shown in Fig. 3b. As the concentration of L-cysteine increased from 0 to 250 mg/L, dry cell weight also increased accordingly from 0.35 g/L to 0.91 g/L. Cell growth declined with further increasing L-cysteine concentration beyond 250 mg/L. A particular concentration ranges of L-cysteine can support growth, but higher amounts of L-cysteine can be toxic to cell growth, which will ultimately inhibit microbial cells (Xie et al., 2013). Excess L-cysteine might interact with disulfide bonds in proteins, causing extracellular polymeric substance matrix aggregation and ultimately leading to cell death (Wen et al., 2019). Although L-cysteine acts as a growth promoting factor, the current study demonstrated that only particular concentrations (<250 mg/L) of cysteine may favor the growth of microbial cells during hydrogen fermentation. Alternatively, cysteine can expedite hydrogen production levels with the reduction in ORP of the fermentation broth. The ORP level of the microbial cells was less than −190 mV in the presence of L-cysteine below 250 mg/L, which proved to be appropriate for encouraging the growth of P. thermoglucosidasius cells during 24–36 h of fermentation. With increasing L-cysteine concentration, the ORP of tested broth samples dropped. The highest ORP values were noticed in the control set (data not shown). The obtained results very well corroborated with the reported studies claiming that increasing L-cysteine concentration can effectively reduce ORP values of broth sample (Zhao et al., 2012). At 550 mg/L L-cysteine, the lowest ORP was observed and hence the lowest hydrogen yield was observed, signifying that excessive concentration of cysteine suppressed hydrogen production. The profile of ORP values in the presence of various concentrations of L-cystiene was more or less similar to the profile obtained for Fe3O4. Various factors such as Hmax, Rmax, and λ values were assessed by correlating data obtained during hydrogen fermentation experiment with Eq. (1) as presented in Table 1. With increasing L-cysteine concentration, both Hmax and Rmax values increased initially and then decreased. The highest Hmax fitted by Eq. (1) was 45.4 mL using 250 mg/L cysteine and the experimental value was 44.5 ± 2.31 mL, exhibiting no substantial difference between these values. The experimental Rmax value was also similar to the fitted value. Higher concentrations of L-cysteine (above 250 mg/L) resulted in the decrease in Hmax and Rmax values."
15,Combined effect of Fe3O4 and cysteine on hydrogen production using pure starch and raw potato peel waste biomass substrate,"3.5 Combined effect of Fe3O4 and cysteine on hydrogen production using pure starch and raw potato peel waste biomass substrate P. thermoglucosidasius strain is known to secrete thermostable α-amylase enzymes (Saeed et al., 2021) required for the hydrolysis of starch materials to generate simple sugars which can be diverted to produce value added fuels such as hydrogen (Mohr et al., 2019). Owing to the known amylase secreting ability of this strain, it was utilized for hydrogen fermentation from raw starch substrates. After inoculation in the fermentation medium, the lag phase lasted 6–7 h. In the exponential phase, the strain exhibited an increase in amylase activity and simultaneously starch degradation began 12 h after fermentation. Fermentation experiments were performed at 55 °C, which favoured the process of amylase secretion and starch hydrolysis. Simultaneously, the released simple sugars after starch hydrolysis served as a carbon source for hydrogen fermentation by P. thermoglucosidasius. Amylaseenzyme hydrolyses the glycosidic bonds in starch molecules and converts them into simple sugars. The α-amylase activity was determined every 12 h of fermentation according to the standard assay procedure as described above (Saeed et al., 2021). Table 2 represents data related to amylase enzyme activities secreted by P. thermoglucosidasius at different time intervals during the hydrogen fermentation process. The maximum amylase activity (5.76 ± 0.303 U/mL) was obtained using potato starch after 36 h of fermentation. In the case of using PWB substrate, the maximum amylase activity (3.51 ± 0.143 U/mL) was achieved after 48 h (Table 2). An additional advantage of using this strain is that the optimal pH and temperature for hydrogen fermentation are also suitable for amylase secretion. After enzymatic hydrolysis of starch, the generated glucose molecules were further utilized by P. thermoglucosidasius strain for hydrogen fermentation. The maximum amylase activities secreted by Bacillus sp. at 55 °C have been reported previously (Arfah et al., 2015). The impact of Fe3O4 and cysteine on hydrogen production by P. thermoglucosidasius using potato starch and raw PWB (25 g/L) substrates were evaluated (Fig. 4 ). The hydrogen production profile using pure potato starch (25 g/L) was studied in 50 mL and 200 mL fermentation medium as shown in Fig. 4a and 4b, respectively. At a concentration of 25 g/L potato starch in 50 mL medium, the strain yielded maximum 62.0 ± 2.76 mL of cumulative hydrogen with a production rate of 0.861 mL/h in 72 h. The maximum hydrogen production rate was 1.01 mL/h after 48 h of fermentation (Fig. 4a). In the case of hydrogen fermentation in 200 mL, higher amount of cumulative hydrogen (167 ± 7.80 mL) was generated with a production rate of 2.32 mL/h after 72 h of fermentation. A maximum hydrogen production rate of 2.81 mL/h was obtained after 48 h of fermentation (Fig. 4b). Total COD values of 13.4 g/L and 4.21 g/L were recorded for 0 h and 48 h of supernatant samples generated during hydrogen fermentation using pure starch substrate, respectively. For economical production of hydrogen, utilization of cheap raw materials such as agricultural residues and wastes is needed, which can aid in reducing the total production cost. In this study, PWB was used as an abundantly available waste material comprising high starch content as a substrate for hydrogen production. Additionally, the bacterial strain P. thermoglucosidasius possessing the ability to secrete amylases was employed for the hydrolysis of raw PWB material at 55 °C, which generates glucose required for the hydrogen fermentation process in a single step, a sustainable strategy. In the case of hydrogen production using raw PWB substrate, P. thermoglucosidasius succeeded in the hydrolysis and conversion of starch substrate to hydrogen. Fig. 4c and 4d illustrate the profile of the cumulative hydrogen yield and production rate using PWB substrates in 50 mL and 200 mL, respectively. Lower hydrogen production was obtained using PWB because PWB contains only ~ 53% starch. As shown in Fig. 4c, using 25 g/L PWB in 50 mL, amylase secretion and glucose accumulation started after 12 h of fermentation. After this period, hydrogen production began, generating a maximum cumulative hydrogen of 31.7 ± 1.35 mL after 72 h with a maximum production rate of 0.528 mL/h. The profile of hydrogen production using 25 g/L PWB in 200 mL is displayed in Fig. 4d. The maximum cumulative hydrogen yield was 71.9 ± 3.20 mL after 72 h and higher production rate of 1.26 mL/h was obtained after 36 h of fermentation (Fig. 4d). COD values were determined to be 11.4 g/L and 5.20 g/L for PWB substrate used during hydrogen fermentation at 0 h and 48 h, respectively. It is evident that both glucose and maltose did not accumulate during the fermentation and were metabolized as soon as they were released. The pattern of soluble metabolite profile observed during hydrogen fermentation was almost similar to that obtained using glucose (as shown in Fig. 2c). For all experiments conducted using starch substrates, unutilized starch was found in the broth at the end of the fermentation process. This may be due to the less amylase activity which might not be sufficient to hydrolyze starch and hence there was no further increase observed in hydrogen production levels. Numerous studies have been reported using hydrolysed starch for hydrogen production involving multiple processing steps (Su et al., 2009, Cheng et al., 2011, Ramprakash and Muthukumar, 2015, Taherdanak et al., 2015, Lin et al., 2016, Zagrodnik and Łaniecki, 2017). However, there are few studies reported using raw starch biomass for hydrogen production. Although the maximum hydrogen yield obtained using a starch substrate in this study is lower than those of the reported studies, it cannot be compared since they used multiple steps such as pretreatment and hydrolysis for hydrogen production. These are the steps which contribute majorly (~50–70%) to the overall production cost of fuels/chemicals at commercial scale. Recently, Hu et al. (2020) reported hydrogen production (128 mL/g) from starch agricultural leftover through photo-fermentation, but they used commercial amylases for biomass hydrolysis and conducted hydrolysis separately at 80 °C. Hence, this process requires additional steps for pretreatment and hydrolysis of biomass, which may not be commercially viable. On the other hand, our process is single step and simple, which will have a huge impact on the overall process cost at the industrial level. In this study, 47.9 mL/g of hydrogen was generated from raw PWB using a single step hydrogen fermentation process that could perform simultaneous pretreatment and hydrolysis of starch due to the amylase secreting ability of the microbial strain. In addition, the optimal fermentation temperature of 55 °C, which did not require strict sterile conditions, was favourable for starch hydrolysis and amylase secretion by P. thermoglucosidasius strain. This is one of the significant aspects concerning industrial scale hydrogen production, where maintaining aseptic conditions is challenging and costly. The only drawbacks of this process are low yield and productivity, which can be improved by further optimizing several parameters and enhancing amylase activity. In addition, strain improvement by inserting additional hydrogenase genes and deleting the genes responsible for the production of the soluble metabolic products will aid in increasing hydrogen yield by diverting the pathway."
16,Enzyme activity and zymogram profiles of hydrogenase,"3.6 Enzyme activity and zymogram profiles of hydrogenase Hydrogenase activity of P. thermoglucosidasius cells harvested during hydrogen fermentation using PWB (25 g/L) was estimated as described above (section 2.5). The addition of Fe3O4 NPs has been shown to improve the hydrogen production yield. Consequently, hydrogenase enzyme levels in P. thermosidasius were determined when cells were grown in hydrogen fermentation medium with and without Fe3O4 NPs. Cells were harvested at different time intervals and cell extracts were prepared. To detect the location of enzymes, the obtained membrane-associated fraction, cytoplasmic soluble fraction, and whole cells were used for hydrogenase activity determination. As shown in Fig. 5 a, the maximum hydrogenase activity was obtained after 36 h of fermentation. Among the fractions used to detect the location of enzyme, the membrane-associated fraction exhibited the highest hydrogenase activity (3.67 ± 0.151 U/mg of protein), followed by the cytoplasmic soluble fraction (1.90 ± 0.083 U/mg) and whole cells (0.20 ± 0.008 U/mg) (Fig. 5a). After confirming the cellular location of hydrogenase enzyme, the membrane-associated hydrogenase activity was estimated and compared for the cells grown with and without Fe3O4 NP addition in the fermentation medium as shown in Fig. 5b. A 2.3-fold increase in membrane-associated hydrogenase activity was observed in membrane-associated extracts of cells grown in the presence of Fe3O4 NPs after 36 h of fermentation as compared to the control (Fig. 5b). Hydrogenase enzymes play a pivotal role in hydrogen production through the conversion of electrons generated during substrate oxidation under anaerobic conditions (Sinha and Pandey, 2011). Mainly, [Ni-Fe]-hydrogenases and [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenases are well known for their catalytic activities associated with Fe and Ni cofactors present in the active sites of enzymes. Therefore, Fe and Ni are predicted to be responsible for the enhancement in hydrogenase activities and consequently the efficiency of the dark fermentation process. Because hydrogenase enzymes are categorized into [Fe-Fe] and [Ni-Fe] hydrogenase, appropriate concentrations of Fe3O4 NPs can provide the key element for bacterial growth and hydrogenase activity which resulted in increased hydrogen yield (Mohanraj et al., 2014). Several studies revealed that Fe3O4 NPs improve ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity by enhancing electron transfer rate which consequently increases hydrogen yield during fermentation process (Han et al., 2011; Mohanraj et al., 2014). The overall progress in hydrogen production profile is most likely due to improved hydrogenase activity and better electron transfer efficiency in P. thermoglucosidasius cells in the presence of Fe3O4 NPs. The obtained results are in compliance with the reported studies about the possible role of Fe2O3 NPs in accelerating the hydrogenase activity and electron transfer of hydrogen producer strain (Engliman et al., 2017). The specific activity of hydrogenase (U/mg of protein) was observed to vary depending on the medium. The medium exhibiting high hydrogen productivity revealed the corresponding high hydrogenase activity of cells grown in the medium containing Fe3O4 NPs (Engliman et al., 2017). Thus, the increase in hydrogenase activity in the presence of Fe3O4 NPs could be ascribed to improved hydrogen production in the respective medium. It is well known that bacterial hydrogenases exhibit isozyme forms. To attain a better understanding of hydrogenase expressed in different conditions (i.e. with and without Fe3O4 NPs), the hydrogenase zymogram staining was implemented using native PAGE analysis (Fig. 5c). In the hydrogenase zymogram gel, two bands corresponding to hydrogenase isoforms Hyd 3 and Hyd 4 were observed when cells were grown in fermentation medium without Fe3O4 NPs. However, cells grown in the presence of Fe3O4 NPs produced additional two hydrogenase isoforms Hyd 1 and Hyd 2 bands with more electrophoretic mobility. These results suggest that the two additional hydrogenase isoforms (Hyd 1 and Hyd 2) in the extract of P. thermoglucosidasius cells were expressed in the presence of Fe3O4 NPs in the fermentation medium. Hence, the improved hydrogen production in the presence of the Fe3O4 NPs can be correlated with the expression of the additional hydrogenase isoforms Hyd1 and Hyd 2. The induction of specific hydrogenase isoforms (Hyd 1 and Hyd 2) expressed in the presence of Fe3O4 during hydrogen production by P. thermoglucosidasius requires further investigation. There is currently no information related to the stoichiometry of the large and small subunits of the hydrogenase enzymes, presenting a new topic for future research."
17,Characterization of microbial cell and potato peel waste biomass containing Fe3O4 nanoparticles after fermentation,"3.7 Characterization of microbial cell and potato peel waste biomass containing Fe3O4 nanoparticles after fermentation For further scrutinizing the structural and functional features of Fe3O4 NPs applied during hydrogen fermentation using PWB substrate, SEM and FTIR analysis were conducted. To comprehend the effects of Fe3O4 NPs on the exterior morphology of P. thermoglucosidasius cells after hydrogen fermentation using PWB substrate, SEM analysis was performed. P. thermoglucosidasius cells treated with Fe3O4 NPs exhibited more agglomeration than those without Fe3O4 NPs. Mostly, aggregates on the cell surface are resulted from proteins associated with bacterial nanowires that are expressed in response to Fe3O4 NPs (Lin et al., 2016), which supposedly enhance glucose transportation through the microbial cell wall. Several studies have been reported in relation to the enhancement in electron transport rate through bacterial nanowires (Lin et al., 2016). As depicted in FTIR analysis, the FTIR spectrum of Fe3O4 NPs adsorbed on PWB substrate recovered after 96 h of hydrogen fermentation experiment was almost similar to that of the control. The peak at 3434 cm−1 is ascribed to the O–H stretching, while the peaks at 2925 and 2860 cm−1 correspond to C–H stretching vibrations. The peaks at 1650 and 1420 cm−1 are H-O–H bending of water molecules and C = O stretching, respectively. The absorption peak at 595 cm−1 corresponds to Fe-O vibration indicating the purity of Fe3O4 NPs (Bertolucci et al., 2015)."
18,Possible mechanism of Fe3O4 nanoparticle action on hydrogen production,"3.8 Possible mechanism of Fe3O4 nanoparticle action on hydrogen production The overall outcomes of the present study revealed that the use of Fe3O4 NPs can meritoriously increase the rate of both substrate utilization and hydrogen production. The probable mechanism of this improved impact is projected in Fig. 6 . ORP is an important feature in augmenting the titres of hydrogen production. The ORP value of the fermented broth sample was observed to decline from −179.5 to −293.4 mV in the presence of Fe3O4 NPs (300 mg/L) as shown in Fig. 2d. The overall improvement in hydrogen production rate in the presence of Fe3O4 NPs (300 mg/L) is due to the increased electron transfer rate (Mohanraj et al., 2014) and hydrogenase activity of P. thermoglucosidasius cells. In addition, the generated metabolite profile recommended that supplementation of Fe3O4 NPs triggered modification in the hydrogen fermentation pathway, causing increased acetate and reduced ethanol production levels (Fig. 2c). As shown in Fig. 6, hydrogen fermentation occurs through two different modes: (i) the formate pathway in which glucose is converted to hydrogen by formate hydrogen lyase and (ii) the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)-dependent pathway relying on hydrogenase activity with NAD+ reoxidation. Fe is known as a vital component of cytochromes in anaerobic microbes. Hence, it can be assumed that the addition of Fe3O4 NPs can promote microbial cell growth and hydrogenase activity of microbes during the hydrogen production process (Wu et al., 2017). The present study indicated that the hydrogenase activity was enhanced from 1.58 to 3.67 U/mg of protein after inclusion of Fe3O4 NPs (300 mg/L) as presented in Fig. 5b. Moreover, Fe is a main element of Fe-S proteins (Wu et al., 2017) responsible for the transfer of electrons towards hydrogenase enzymes essential for hydrogen production. The mechanisms propose that optimal level of Fe3O4 NPs conceivably elevate both hydrogenase enzyme activity and electron transfer rate in microbial cells during the hydrogen fermentation process. In addition, supplementation of Fe3O4 NPs exhibited alterations in the hydrogen production metabolic pathway, resulting in enhanced acetate titres and declined ethanol production levels. As depicted in Fig. 6, 1 mol of glucose consumes 4 mol of NADH molecules during ethanol fermentation (red box), whereas no NADH is consumed during acetic acid fermentation (green box), which allows extra NADH to convert H+ to H2."
19,Conclusions,"In the present study, the hydrogen yield potential, ORP, and hydrogenase activities from PWB with Fe3O4 NPs and L-cystiene addition under dark fermentation were assessed. Hydrogen fermentation using pure starch and PWB generated maximum cumulative hydrogen yields of 167 and 71.9 mL with maximum production rates of 2.81 and 1.26 mL/h, respectively. The overall attained results revealed that the inclusion of Fe3O4 NPs exhibited bacterial aggregation and stimulated hydrogenase activity, which in turn improved hydrogen yield and productivity. The current work highlights the prospective opportunity of utilizing PWB for hydrogen production using starch degrading P. thermoglucosidasius strain."
