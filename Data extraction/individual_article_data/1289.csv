0,Introduction,"Biodiesel consists of a long-chain of Fatty Acid Ethyl (FAEE) or Methyl (FAME) Esters formed from the transesterification of triglycerides (TG) with alcohol, generally methanol or ethanol, in a chemical reaction also known as alcoholysis. It also produces glycerol as a byproduct, which has some commercial value. Biodiesel has combustion-related properties similar to those of petroleum diesel; it also operates in compression ignition (diesel) engines and requires very little or no engine modifications [1]. Biodiesel can be blended in any proportion with petroleum diesel to create a biodiesel blend or can be used in its pure form. The use of biodiesel instead of diesel in conventional engines can result in substantial reduction in emission of unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and particulate matters [1,2]. Therefore, biodiesel could alleviate the high demand for energy and fossil fuels, such as diesel and coal, and could give abilities to achieve sustainable development pathways. Main sources of TG are edible oils/fats, such as animal fats and vegetable oils (soybean, canola and palm oil) so they compete with their destination as food for human consumption (first generation of biofuels). Recently, sources of non-edible oils (so-called second generation) such as Jatropha curcas have been investigated as an alternative to the edible vegetable oils [3–5]. These sources of raw materials do not satisfy the existing demand for transport fuels [6–9], so there has been an increasing interest to produce biofuels from other sources such as lignocellulosic materials from industrial wastes (included in the second generation of biofuels) and microalgae (third generation). Potentially, they offer great opportunities in the longer term and do not need to compete for arable land and precious freshwater [10,11]. Microalgae are considered the most promising non-edible source of TG for producing biofuels. Some microalgae are excellent sources of lipids with cell contents of up to ca. 30% w/w in actively growing cells, and over 50% w/w in stationary phase cells [12] (e.g., Scenedesmus obliquus has between 30 and 43% w/w of lipids [13]; Nannochloropsis sp 21.6–35.8% [14]; Chlorella emersonii 63% [15]; Chlorella pyrenoidosa 16–64% [16]), and these lipids can be converted to biodiesel by transesterification. Moreover, they have rapid growth, and the productivity of intensive outdoor microalgae cultivation is approximately 5–27 times that of the oilseeds such as canola, soybean, and palm oil [11]. Spirulina platensis (blue-green algae) is a species that can be a good source to produce biodiesel [17], since its multicellular structure and self-aggregation capacity it can be sedimented by gravity in the harvesting process, which is a relatively inexpensive separation method [18]. Industrial production of biodiesel has faced two major problems. First, when using a homogeneous catalyst, usually sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, it is necessary to separate the biodiesel from the catalyst after the reaction, which is complex and expensive. Also, a high purity of the raw material with low contents of free fatty acids and water is required [19], because the presence of such compounds results in soup formation, catalyst consume reducing its effectiveness, and finally negatively affecting the reaction yield [20]. Second, conventional biodiesel is synthesized at low temperatures (∼60 °C) and atmospheric pressure [21], which implies 1–4 h of reaction [22]. An attractive alternative is the supercritical transesterification process because reaction time is shorter and it is avoided the use of a catalyst. The reaction conditions in supercritical transesterification are much higher (>240 °C and >8.1 MPa) than conventional transesterification, which could result in the degradation of the fatty acid esters formed and promote side reactions affecting the reaction conversion [3]. However, in a more recent development in the area it has been proposed process intensification by using a co-solvent with a critical point lower than that of the alcohol in the non-catalytic supercritical transesterification [23–29]. This would allow decreasing the critical point of the mixture such that the reaction is carried out at moderate conditions, enhancing the mutual solubility of the oil-alcohol mixture, reducing the transport limitations, and increasing the reaction rates [25,26,30]. In the literature there are several studies regarding the use of co-solvents in the non-catalyzed supercritical transesterification of vegetable oils, using carbon dioxide [26,27,31,32] or hexane [28,29,33]. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one work that used microalgae as a source of TG [29]. Najafabadi, et al. [29] investigated the effect of different types of co-solvents, such as diethyl ether, chloroform and hexane, for in situ transesterification of Chlorella Vulgaris C oil. In that work, it was shown that the addition of hexane as co-solvent almost did not increase the reaction yield from 6% w/w (weight of FAME/dry weight of biomass) without co-solvent to 7% w/w at 290 °C and 60 min without pressure control along the reaction. Among the potential co-solvents for supercritical transesterification, SuperCritical (SC) carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the most promising because is non-flammable, non-toxic, not corrosive in the presence of water, and can be obtained from renewable resources in large quantities with high purity and low cost [34,35]. It is easily removable solute leaving no residue in the final product (high volatility) because it is a gas at atmospheric conditions, therefore is readily recoverable by recycling processes. Also, it has favorable critical parameters, compared to typical alcohols used in biodiesel synthesis (Table 1 ) and it is a suitable co-solvent for short and intermediate chain length organic molecules [26,36]. Han et al. [26] obtained that as the CO2/methanol ratio increased (at constant temperature), the FAME yield for the supercritical reaction of methanol with soybean oil increased. They found that the optimum temperature was 280 °C when the molar ratio of CO2 to methanol was 0.1, and at higher molar ratios this curve remains almost unchanged. Similar results were obtained by Jiang and Tan [23] on supercritical transesterification reaction of coconut oil with methanol. They indicate that by adding CO2 in the 30:1:3 molar ratio (methanol/oil/co-solvent) the FAME yield was increased from 42% w/w (without co-solvent) to 63.6% w/w. In general, the experimental conditions set for obtaining high yields (70–>95% ester content) by supercritical transesterification are between 270–350 °C, 10–45 MPa, 1:20–1:43 oil to alcohol molar ratio, and 4–110 min [3]. There is some restrictions, for example, pressures above 20 MPa may not be industrially viable for the high implementation costs [37–39], and temperatures above 300 °C and long reaction periods commonly cause degradation of the esters [3,40]. This work is focused on the intensification of the supercritical transesterification process of microalgae oil by employing CO2 as a co-solvent and in this way contributes to state of the art in the biodiesel production of the third generation. Moreover, it is proposed to investigate the effect of alcohol type in the process to determine which is superior concerning reaction yield. Therefore, the objective of this research is to study the effect of reaction temperature and use of CO2 as co-solvent on the transesterification reaction yield using TG from microalgae, and methanol and ethanol as alcohols at supercritical conditions to produce biodiesel."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Spirulina platensis oil, extracted by cold-pressing and supplied by Insumos Naturales (Chillán, Chile), was used for supercritical transesterifications. Dynamic viscosity (η) of the oil was determined using a rheometer (TA Instruments Discovery HR-2) at 40 °C, with cone/plate geometry (truncation height 55 mm for the 40 mm diameter, 2° cone). A flow ramp with a shear rate ( γ ˙ ) from 1 s−1 to 100 s−1 for 600 s was used to obtain the linear relation with shear stress ( τ = η ⋅ γ ˙ ). The density (ρ = m/v) was obtained by measuring 1.7 ml with a micropipete (Satorius Proline 1000–5000 μl) and weighing it on an analytical balance (RADWAG AS 82/220.R2) at 20 °C in triplicate. A molecular weight of 845.19 (g mol−1), reported by El-Shimi et al. [41], was used in the calculations. Anhydrous ethanol (grade A.C.S., 99.99%) and anhydrous methanol (grade A.C.S., 99.90%) from J.T. Baker was provided by Soviquim (Santiago, Chile), CO2 (food grade,>99.9%) was provided by Indura S.A. (Santiago, Chile)."
3,Experimental setup for supercritical transesterification reactions,"2.2 Experimental setup for supercritical transesterification reactions Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of a supercritical reaction unit custom-designed and manufactured by Eurotechnica (Bargteheide, Germany). The co-solvent from a CO2 cylinder was fed to a cooling bath Labtech LCB-R08 (Hopkinton, MA) at −5 °C. A high-pressure syringe pump from Teledyne Isco (Lincoln, NE) model 260D drove the liquid CO2 to the heated reactor (DI = 17.4 mm; L = 304.8 mm; V = 72 cm3) up to 20 MPa. The controlled temperature was measured with a K-type thermocouple located inside the vessel. Reaction temperature was reached by means of electrical resistors placed around the reactor wall."
4,Ratio of the amount of oil (with alcohol at 1:40 molar ratio) and CO2 in the reactor,"2.3 Ratio of the amount of oil (with alcohol at 1:40 molar ratio) and CO2 in the reactor Before carrying out the experimental design experiments, it was necessary to determine the relationship between the amount of oil (and alcohol mixture in molar ratio 1:40) and the amount of CO2 in the reactor up to 20 MPa at different temperatures (200 or 300 °C). The amount of mixture was initially deposited in the reactor and the amount of CO2 was determined by mass balance of the syringe pump, before and after pressurization. Therefore, the range of the CO2-to-alcohol used for the experimental designs of methanolysis and ethanolysis, which are shown below, were based on the size of the reactor."
5,Experimental procedure,"2.4 Experimental procedure The cooling bath is turned on until it reaches the set point of temperature and a constant pressure (V-3 shut). Then V-1 and V-2 are closed. The initial conditions of the pump (volume, temperature, and pressure) are recorded. For above the reactor was introduced the amount of microalgae oil and alcohol (methanol or ethanol) mixture calculated previously (V-4 shut). The reactor and V-5 are closed. The reactor is heated to the desired temperature. The syringe pump is pressurized up to approximately 10 MPa (V-3 open), then V-4 is opened, and the system is pressurized up to 20 MPa. When the pressure is reached, V-3 and V-4 are closed. The final conditions (at stable temperature and pressure) of the pump are recorded. After 30 min of reaction, the product obtained was collected in glass vial, which were kept in a desiccator to eliminate the remaining alcohol, and then closed and refrigerated until the separation of phases by decantation."
6,Experimental design,"2.5 Experimental design Table 2 shows the factorial experimental design 22 with two central points (6 experiments) used for both methanol and ethanol. In this work were studied two process variables that affecting the supercritical transesterification reaction yield (Y); temperature (A) and CO2-to-alcohol (B). The response was calculated as the percentage of the mass of Fatty Acid Alkyl Ester product (FAAE, the upper layer) to the initial mass of oil (Eq. (1)). (1) Y = M F A A E M o i l 100 % For all experiments, the alcohol-to-oil molar ratio was maintained constant at 40:1, reaction time at 30 min, and reaction pressure at 20 MPa."
7,Analysis of samples and data processing,"2.6 Analysis of samples and data processing FAAE samples from microalgae for methanolysis were sent to GC-FID analysis (protocol ISO 15304 [42]) to external laboratory DICTUC S.A. (Santiago, Chile) to determine the composition of FAME of each experiment. STATGRAPHICS Centurion XVII was used for the statistical analysis of the results. An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was carried out to determine which effects are statistically significant with a confidence level of 95%. The goodness of fit of the linear models was analyzed using different statistics, such as correlation coefficient (R2), Standard Error of the Estimate (SEE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Durbin-Watson statistic (DW)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Preliminary experiments,"3.1 Preliminary experiments Preliminary experiments were conducted before the experimental design in order to characterize the Spirulina oil and delimit the CO2-to-alcohol domain of study. Dynamic viscosity (@40 °C) of Spirulina platensis oil was 20.62 mPas and density (@20 °C) was 949 kg m−3. For the same oil, El-Shimi et al. [41] reported values of 58 mPa s (at 40 °C) and 892 kg m−3 (at 27 °C), respectively, which differs mainly in viscosity, but they used another method of oil extraction (Soxhlet), which can modify the characteristics and composition of the oil [43]. While for some vegetable oils similar values have been reported of 21–46 mPas (at 50–35 °C) [44] and 914–916 kg m−3 [45] respectively. Ratio of the amount of oil (with alcohol at 1:40 molar ratio) and CO2 in the reactor are shown in Fig. 2 a and b for methanolysis and ethanolysis respectively."
10,Supercritical transesterification with methanol as alcohol: methanolysis,"3.2 Supercritical transesterification with methanol as alcohol: methanolysis The results obtained in the transesterifications with microalgae oil with methanol or ethanol are shown in Table 3 . The ANOVA (Table 4 ) indicates that both effects (A and B) have a p-value of less than 0.05, and therefore the null hypothesis of the equality of means of the levels of each factor is rejected, that is, they are statistically significant with a 95% confidence level. On the contrary, the interaction of these effects (AB) is not significant (p-value > 0.05). This results can also be seen in the Pareto diagram (Fig. 3 a), where it can be seen that both variables had a positive effect on the reaction yield, despite the B effect is higher than A. In general, a higher reaction temperature improves the solubility of the reactants and affects the kinetics of the reaction by increasing the kinetic energy of the particles and the relative probability of collisions between them, which would increase the yield. An increase in the reaction temperature would also allow a more accessible breakdown of the triglyceride bonds and their combination with the methyl group of the alcohol to become FAME. Due to the trend obtained, it is possible that higher temperatures allow better conversions. However, high temperatures for long reaction times would decompose the formed FAMEs and increase the operational cost of heating [40]. Using CO2 as a co-solvent could increase the mutual solubility between methanol and oil under supercritical conditions. The critical point of CO2 is lower than that of methanol (Table 1), which allows the reaction mixture to form a single phase at lower temperatures [26]. Mathematical model developed includes the main effects on reaction yield (Eq. (2)). In Fig. 4 a response surface graph is shown using the model obtained. The R 2 statistic indicates that the adjusted model explains 99.4% of the variability in yield. The SEE shows that the standard deviation of the residuals is 0.011. The MAE of 0.007 is the average value of the residuals. The DW statistic tests of 1.9 (p = 0.52) indicates no serial autocorrelation in the residues with a level of significance of 5.0%. According to goodness-of-fit analysis, the model adjusts appropriately to the experimental data obtained. (2) Y M e t O H = ( 0.251 + 0.00055 × A + 98.0 × B ) × 100 % Table 5 shows the characterization of the product obtained in each experiment, with the FAME composition. That indicates that the amount of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids varies depending on the operational conditions used in each experiment, which would affect its physical and chemical properties [46]. A higher reaction temperature or quantity of co-solvent increased the degree of unsaturation of the product, that could be because the oil conversion to FAMEs increased and the FAMEs produced still did not decompose at those temperatures. Polyunsaturated FAMEs are much less thermally stable than saturated and monounsaturated FAMEs in supercritical methanol [40]. A high reaction temperature increase cis/trans isomerization, hydrogenation and pyrolysis of FAMEs [47]. Shin et al. [47] evaluated the thermal stability of FAMEs in supercritical methanol and the results demonstrated that transesterification in supercritical methanol should be carried out at less than 325 °C (at 23 MPa and 20 min) to avoid thermal degradation of polyunsaturated FAMEs. Imahara et al. [40] found similar results, who concluded that the supercritical methanol transesterification lower than 300 °C, preferably 270 °C with a pressure higher than 8.09 MPa, is appropriate to keep the maximal yield and thermal stabilization of biodiesel. Salar-García et al. [4] determined the relationship between temperature and time in the decomposition of saturated (C16:0), monounsaturated (C18:1) and polyunsaturated (C18:2) FAMEs. The results showed that at 300 °C and 30 min the decomposition of none of them still did not happen."
11,Supercritical transesterification with ethanol as alcohol: ethanolysis,"3.3 Supercritical transesterification with ethanol as alcohol: ethanolysis ANOVA (Table 6 ) indicates that both effects (A and B) and interaction (AB) have a p-value higher than 0.05, and therefore they are not significant for the yield with 95% confidence level. Similar to methanolysis, in ethanolysis both variables had a positive effect on the yield. However, the interaction of AB has a negative impact on the response (Fig. 3b). The R 2 indicates that the adjusted model (Eq. (3)) explains 71.9% of the variability in yield. The SEE shows that the standard deviation of the residuals is 8.8. The MAE of 4.8 is the average value of the residuals. The DW statistic was 0.635 (P = 0.095), which indicates that there is no serial autocorrelation in the residuals with a level of significance of 5.0%.

12,Comparison of ethanolysis and methanolysis,"3.4 Comparison of ethanolysis and methanolysis Highest reaction yields obtained in this work for methanolysis (72% at 300 °C and 0.003 g CO2/g methanol) and ethanolysis (68% at 300 °C and 0.001 g CO2/g ethanol) are within the reported ranges [48–50], but still they could be improved by changing operational conditions, such as longer reaction time and higher alcohol-to-oil molar ratio. Comparing the results obtained between methanolysis and ethanolysis at the same operational conditions, higher conversions could be achieved with ethanol as alcohol according with reported works [51,52]. For example, at 200 °C and 0.001 g CO2/g alcohol we obtained 65% of yield in ethanolysis, and at the same conditions we calculated a yield of 46% in methanolysis (Eq. (2)). This observation can be partially explained by the solubility of these alcohols in oil. The Hildebrand solubility parameter (δ) is defined as the square root of the cohesive energy density and provides a quantitative estimate of the degree of interaction between compounds, where similar δ values indicate a greater miscibility than others. Some vegetable oils have a solubility parameter between 18.3–20.5 MPa0.5 [53], and the fatty acids have a solubility parameter between 18.0–20.8 MPa0.5 [53], while methanol and ethanol have a solubility parameter of 29.7 and 26.2 MPa0.5, respectively [54]. Because of ethanol solubility parameter is lower than the methanol and it is closer to the oil/fatty acids solubility parameter, the conversions are higher with ethanol compared to the conversions obtained with methanol. Even more, CO2-alcohol mixture density is 11.5% greater in the case of ethanol than methanol (calculated by mass weighting of individuals densities under reaction conditions studied), which suggests that oil solubilized better in a CO2-ethanol mixture, promoting a single-phase reaction, and hence, a higher reaction yield. However, it is important to mention that despite higher reaction yields estimated with ethanol, the amount required is 44% (by mass) more than with methanol (at constant oil-to-alcohol molar ratio), because of its higher molecular weight, which would imply a higher solvent and energy costs negatively affecting the environmental life cycle of the process. Therefore, a life cycle analysis should be carried out [55] and an economic study of the processes studied to determine which alcohol is preferable to use to improve the sustainability and renewal of the transesterification process."
13,Conclusions,"For the methanolysis reaction at the range of operational conditions studied in this work, a linear regression model was obtained relating yield reaction with temperature and CO2-to-methanol mass ratio, which provides an accurate description of the experimental data. The effect of both factors was statistically significant (95% level of confidence) and positive on reaction yield, being more important the effect the use the co-solvent in the supercritical transesterification than the reaction temperature. The use of a greater amount of CO2 as a co-solvent allowed improving the performance of the reaction, possibly due to the decrease of the critical point of the mixture, which would allow reducing the severe operating conditions of the supercritical reaction technology. FAME composition profile of the experiments were determined, and it was found that temperature and CO2-to-methanol mass ratio increased the degree of unsaturation, which indicates that the physical-chemical properties of the product would be affected. For the ethanolysis reaction, it was determined that the effect of the variables studied was not statistically significant, and the experimental design proposed should be strengthened with the addition of replicas or central points. Experimentally higher yields were obtained in methanolysis than ethanolysis, because more amount of CO2 could be used, but at the same operational conditions higher yields could be obtained in ethanolysis, which is attributed to the higher solubility of ethanol with the oil and fatty acids and the higher mixture density. Anyway, 44% (w/w) more ethanol than methanol is required, which increases the consumption of alcohol and energy, and an economic study must be carried out, and the life cycle of the processes must be analyzed."
