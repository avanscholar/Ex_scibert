0,Introduction,"The continuing detrimental effects of particulate emissions from different engineering combustion systems on health and atmospheric air quality, despite continuous strict global particle emissions legislation, necessitates further examination of their formation and toxicity. Poly aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), found adsorbed onto the surface of soot particles, are the principal source of this toxicity [1]. The connection between poly aromatic hydrocarbons and soot formation is reasonably well-understood, with PAHs considered to be the principal soot precursors. Following the formation of single aromatic rings, the rings grow via a number of mechanisms into larger species and eventually form into soot particles. Fine particles pose a greater risk to human health as they can be inhaled and carry PAHs deep into the lungs [2]. The United States Environmental Protective Agencies (US EPA) has listed 16 potentially toxic PAHs which are cited worldwide. Out of these 16 PAHs, benzo[A]pyrene is considered the most toxic [3]; its link with human lung cancer has been established [4], and is therefore amongst the most studied PAHs [5]. The 16 priority US EPA PAHs investigated in this study, with abbreviations, is shown in Table 1 . Alcohol based biofuels are considered to be potential sustainable alternative fuels, either on their own or as blending components, because they can be obtained from a variety of potentially sustainable materials which can be sourced worldwide [6]. Several experimental and numerical studies have been carried out to investigate the combustion characteristic of alcohol biofuels including ethanol, propanol, and butanol, where the addition of alcohol fuels to fossil fuels reduced the emissions of polyaromatic hydrocarbons and particulates matter. Amongst all the alcohol fuels, ethanol is widely considered as a liquid alternative fuel [7,8]. Ethanol and its blends with other fuels have been previously studied in different combustion systems, such as tube reactors and flames [9–18]. From these studies, it can be concluded that the addition of ethanol to fossil fuel suppressed the sooting tendency and PAHs formation. Esarte et al., 2011, 2012 studied the effect of the addition of ethanol to acetylene pyrolysis in a flow tube reactor and reported that the addition of ethanol promotes the formation of carbon monoxide and methane, which in turn prevents much of the fuel carbon forming soot and PAHs. Propanol and butanol have been studied in flow reactors[11,17,19], shock tubes [20–25], flames [26–33], and engine [34–38]; these works focus on enhancing the understanding of the gas phase processes during the combustion process. However, some studies have investigated the effect of butanol isomers on the formation of PAHs and soot propensity[13,33,39]. For example, Vikeri et al., 2017 studied the effect of 1-butanol, 2-butanol, isobutanol, and tert‑butanol on the formation of PAHs and soot in a pyrolysis tubular flow reactor at a temperature range of 1273 K −1473 K and found that the soot mass increased with increasing β H-atoms due to the ease of unimolecular decomposition at these sites. They also found that the total PAHs concentration decreased with an increase of temperature from 1273 K - 1473 K with the highest concentration of PAHs formed at 1273 K regardless of the isomers examined. Nonetheless, the details of soot and growth of PAHs from the pyrolysis of propanol and butanol isomers that can be drawn from the current literature is limited, and the influence of alcohol carbon chain length and hydroxyl group position on the gas-phase and particle-phase PAHs and their toxicity are still not well understood. Further, understanding of links between specific alcohol isomers and individual PAHs growth mechanisms remain incomplete. Therefore, in order to improve understanding of the influence of alcohol fuel molecular structure on soot and PAHs formation and their relative toxicity, a homologous series of C2 to C4 alcohol fuels have been investigated and reported in this paper. The results show the influence of alcohol composition, including chain length, C/O ratio and hydroxyl group position, on soot and PAHs formation, and estimated toxicity, in a pyrolytic environment. The particulates were generated from the pyrolysis of alcohol fuels in a laminar flow reactor. C2 to C4 alcohols were entrained in nitrogen and were pyrolysed at fixed concentration of 10,000 ppm on carbon atoms basis, at a temperature range of 1323 to 1623 K under oxygen free conditions. The soot produced from the pyrolysis of the test fuels was collected from the exit of the reactor, and the gaseous PAHs at the exit of the reactor were also collected on resin. Both the soot-borne and resin-borne PAHs were then extracted from the samples using accelerated solvent extractor (ASE). This was followed by identification and quantification of the extracted PAHs using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy (GCMS). The oxygen free pyrolysis and the temperatures range used in the experiments resemble roughly the conditions at the core of diesel engine sprays during the premixed and early diffusion stages of combustion. The above literature review is summarised in Table 2 ."
1,Experimental methodology,
2,Experimental setup and conditions,"2.1 Experimental setup and conditions 2.1.1 Sampling generation The experiments on the alcohol fuels were carried out in a high temperature flow reactor facility described in detail previously [45–48], therefore only a brief description is given here. The reactor tube was 1440 mm long with an inside diameter of 104 mm and it was vertically positioned and heated electrically. The pyrolysis of the C2 to C4 alcohol fuels was carried out at a fixed concentration of 10,000 ppm on a carbon atom basis in a heated nitrogen stream flowing through the reactor tube, at a temperature range of 1323 to 1623 K at atmospheric pressure. Oxygen-free nitrogen procured from BOC was used as the carrier gas with a fixed flow rate of 20 l/min (STP conditions) and was metered through a mass flow controller. The soot and gaseous products generated by the pyrolysis of fuels were collected at the exit of the tube reactor on a 70 mm glass microfibre filter paper (chosen as it should not contain any PAH prior to soot sampling) and XAD-2 resin respectively. Figure 1 shows in schematic form the tube reactor used for all experiments, with gaseous and liquid fuel supply lines and sample paths for soot and XAD-2 resin collection. The accuracy (including linearity and based on actual calibration supplied by the manufacturer) of the Bronkhorst mass flow controller was ±0.5% Rd plus ±0.1% FS, while the uncertainly in readings from the k-type thermocouples utilised was ± 1 °C. All soot masses were weighed on a mass balance of 1 μg resolution. The longitudinal temperature profile used in this work has been previously reported [49]. For this study the gas residence time, which is the ratio of tube reactor volume/gas flow rate at a set temperature was t(s) = 4479/T. Table 3 shows the soot yield ((Conc. soot (mg/m3) /(carbon inlet (mg)/N2 inlet (m3)))*100) and the residence time for each fuel and temperature tested. 2.1.2 PAHs extraction The particle and gas-phase PAHs were extracted from the soot collected on the filter paper and on the XAD-2 resin using a Thermofisher Scientific Dinox-150 accelerated solvent extractor (ASE) using dichloromethane (DCM) as the solvent. DCM has a lower boiling point (40 °C) compared to all PAHs (218–536 °C) and can be easily evaporated during subsequent concentrations of the extracted PAHs for GC analysis. DCM has been used previously by many researchers for PAH extraction[45,50]. The method used for the extraction can be found in the supplementary data, Table S1. For each soot and resin sample, the ASE extraction was repeated three times and a total of 60 ml of extraction was generated from the three extractions. 2.1.3 PAHs concentration The 60 ml extract was first concentrated to 15 ml by gently blowing pure nitrogen across the surface of the extraction vial, which was placed on a heated block; the temperature of the block was maintained at 40 °C by a PID controller. The 15 ml extraction was then transferred to a 15 ml graduated glass tube and subsequently concentrated further to 1 ml. 2.1.4 PAHs analysis The 1 ml concentrated samples were analysed using Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry with a Restek Rxi-17Sil MS (Fused silica, 30 m* 250 µm*0.25 µm) column. Pure helium was used as a carrier gas with a flow of 2 ml/min. A GC automatic liquid sampler (ALS) was used with an injection volume of 1 µL in a split-less mode. The GC oven was initially heated to a temperature of 65 °C and held for 0.5 min, then ramped up as follows: to 220 °C at a rate of 15 °C/min and held for 1 min; to 330 °C at a rate of 4 °C/min and held for 0.5 min; post-run at 339 °C for 5 min. Total run time for each sample was 39.83 min and the transfer line was maintained at a temperature of 290 °C. The MS used was a single quadrupole in electronic ions (EI) mode, with MS source and quad temperatures of 230 °C and 150 °C respectively. For quantification of PAHs, an external standard mix was used containing the 16 EPA priority PAH, detailed in Table 1. This was procured from Sigma Aldrich at a 2000 μg/ml concentration diluted in dichloromethane (DCM). As the PAHs on the particulate and in a gaseous phase were present at a wide range of concentrations, the external standard was first diluted from 2000 to 50 ppm and then further serially diluted to six calibration standards. For dilution, high purity DCM was procured from Sigma Aldrich. An internal standard mix of 2000 μg/ml concentration diluted in dichloromethane was also procured from Sigma Aldrich. The internal standard mix was further diluted to the middle concentration of the calibration standards and was added to all the samples and calibration standards vials for PAHs quantification as recommended by EPA Method TO-3A. EPA Method TO-3A for the internal standard was adopted for PAH quantification where different PAH of the 16 were assigned to one or more of the specific deuterated PAH within the internal standard. The internal standard mix contained five deuterated PAHs and more details can be found in supplementary data, Table S2. Fig. 2 shows a sample chromatogram of the 20 ppm calibration standard measured in selected ion mode. The numbered peaks shown in Fig. 2 are the 16 priority PAHs e.g. number 1 is Naphthalene while number 16 is Benzo (g,h, i) perylene, while the five smaller peaks apparent in the chromatogram, labelled a to e, are the deuterated PAH utilised as internal standards."
3,C2 C4 alcohol fuel molecules,"2.2 C2 C4 alcohol fuel molecules Five, 99.6% certified AR grade, alcohol fuels were sourced from Sigma Aldrich and their properties are shown in Table 4 . These fuels consisted of the C2 C4 straight chain alcohol (ethanol, 1-propanol and 1-butanol) and C3 C4 straight chain alcohol isomers (1-propanol,2-propanol and 1-butanol,2-butanol). The C4 branched alkyl chain alcohol isomers (isobutanol and tert‑butanol) were not included as the primary focus of the current study was the impact of the hydroxyl group as opposed to the presence of methyl branching within an alkyl moiety. Figure 3 shows the test fuel molecular structure. Therefore, the following effects of the alcohol fuel molecular structure on the soot propensity and PAHs formation at temperatures between 1323 K and 1623 K were investigated: Influence of increasing alkyl chain length and hydroxyl group position on soot propensity, and on the amount of gas-phase and particle-borne PAHs, and the estimated toxicity of PAHs. Possible mechanisms that lead to individual PAH growth from alcohol molecules."
4,Results and discussion,In this section of the paper the experimental results and discussion are presented.
5,Fuel effects on soot mass concentration,"3.1 Fuel effects on soot mass concentration Figure 4 shows the mass of soot collected from the C2 C4 alcohols at a range of temperatures from 1323 K to 1623 K, where the mass of soot collected from the filter was normalised with the volume of gas drawn through the filter. The measurement of soot mass concentration and PAHs from ethanol pyrolysis was repeated 5 times so as to assess the repeatability of experimental analytical processes, and in Fig. 4, and throughout, where shown in results figures, the error bars show plus and minus one standard deviation from the mean value, where the mean value is obtained from repeated ethanol pyrolysis. Ethanol was chosen as a reference fuel due to the higher oxygen to carbon ratio relative to the other test fuels and observed a lower mass of soot collected for a constant supply of 10,000 ppmC (Table 3). Apparent from Fig. 4 is an increase in soot concentration concurrent in general with an increase in the carbon number of the alcohols, and also with increasing temperature up to 1523 K. Figure 4 shows that the mass concentration of soot collected increased with increase of temperature of the tube reactor from 1323 K to 1523 K and subsequently slightly decreased at 1623 K for all the fuels examined. Also apparent in Fig. 4, is that the soot mass concentration for all fuels changed significantly from 1323 K to 1423 K, and in future work; however, the exact initiation temperature of elevated soot formation for each fuel was not investigated further in the current work which focused on the relative effects of fuel molecular structure on soot and PAHs formation at consistent temperature conditions. This increase in the mass concentration of soot with rising temperature is consistent with that reported previously in the literature [9,10,54]. It is apparent from Fig. 4 that the pyrolysis of the C3 and C4 alcohol fuels produced a considerably higher mass of soot in comparison to C2 alcohol. Increasing the carbon number of C2 C4 alcohol fuels increased the mass concentration of soot at all temperatures tested, with 2-propanol an exception at 1523 K and 1623 K producing more mass of soot than 2-butanol. The pyrolysis of ethanol produced considerably lower soot mass concentrations, in comparison to the C3 and C4 alcohols. For instance, at 1523 K ethanol produced 2.8 times less the mass of soot than 2-propanol. At a temperature of 1323 K, ethanol produced no soot and this observation is supported by similar findings by other researchers [10]. The observed increase in soot mass with both alcohol carbon number and C/O ratio is further explored in Section 4.3. It is also evident from Fig. 4 that the 2-propanol isomer yielded more soot than 1-propanol at all temperatures tested. For instance, at a temperature of 1523 K 2-propanol produced 1.5 times more soot mass concentration than 1-propanol. This difference in soot mass between the two propanol isomers might be due to the difference in the formation rate of the propargyl radicals (C3H3), as reported in the literature [55]. The propargyl radical is considered to be one of the main precursors in the formation of the first aromatic ring [56,57] which is a prerequisite to subsequent PAHs growth and initial soot particle inception. Propargyl radicals also play an important role in the formation of the two-ring species e.g. indene and naphthalene, via phenyl and propargyl, and propargyl and benzyl, reaction sequences [58,59] without first forming a benzene ring. Furthermore, it has also been reported that 2-propanol yields more propene by the four-centre molecular dehydration reaction as compared to 1-propanol; in turn, propene converts readily into propargyl radical leading to a greater yield of soot mass [30]. Considering the C4 butanol isomers, the position of the hydroxyl group influenced the yield of soot mass, with 2-butanol observed to produce more soot mass than 1-butanol. For example, at 1623 K 2-butanol produced 1.3 times more soot mass concentration as compared to 1-butanol. This trend of high soot mass by 2-butanol could be due to the two butanol isomers having different reaction pathways via the four-centre elimination reaction, both butanols predominantly consumed by H-abstraction [31,40]. The higher sooting tendency of 2-butanol is likely to be due to the higher availability of β H-atom compared with 1-butanol [40]. The consistent production of more soot by 2-butanol relative to 1-butanol is in agreement with similar findings reported in the literature [26,32] and also with the influence of OH position observed in the case of propanol. In summary, the results in Fig. 4 for the C2 to C4 alcohol fuels show that an increase in carbon number (and thus also C/O ratio given the pyrolytic conditions) increased the soot mass concentration at all temperatures, except in the case of 2-propanol at 1523 K and 1623 K. Furthermore, a difference can be observed in the conversion of C3 and C4 alcohol isomers to soot mass concentration, with secondary alcohols yielding higher soot mass at all temperatures than the corresponding primary alcohols for reasons discussed above."
6,Fuel effects on gas-phase and particle-phase PAHs,"3.2 Fuel effects on gas-phase and particle-phase PAHs Figure 5 shows the total PAH measured (sum of the 16 US EPA priority PAH speciated) for each of the C2 to C4 alcohols tested. Figure 5a presents the gas-phase (GP) PAH mass concentration extracted from the XAD-2 resin per unit volume of gas drawn through the resin. The concentration of lighter species 2, 3, and some 4 ring PAHs up to pyrene is much greater in the gas phase, however, in this study heavier species were also observed in the gas phase, details can be found in supplementary data, Tables S3 and S4. The high concentration of lighter PAHs in the gas phase is in agreement with previous studies [60]. Figure 5b shows the particulate-phase (PP) PAH that has been extracted from the particulate deposited on the filter paper per unit volume of gas drawn through the filter. Figure 5c shows the particulate-phase PAH extracted but this time normalised with the mass of soot collected on the filter, while Fig. 5d is the ratio of PP/GP normalized per volume of gas. In Fig. 5a, the C3 and C4 alcohol fuels show decreasing concentrations of gas-phase (GP) PAH with increasing temperature in the range of 1423 K to 1623 K. This is likely to be due to a decrease in the concentration of lighter PAHs (2 and 3 rings) at higher temperatures above 1423 K as shown in Figure 8. It is likely that the decrease in the GP PAH concentration with increased temperature is the result of increased rates of conversion of GP PAHs to heavier PAHs, and subsequently to soot particles. Ethanol pyrolysis resulted in a significantly lower GP PAH concentration in comparison with that for C3 and C4 fuels at all temperatures (Fig. 5a), and this may potentially be attributable to the slower formation of intermediate PAH precursors (i.e. acetylene) from ethanol pyrolysis. It is also interesting to note from Fig. 5a that pyrolysis of 2-propanol resulted in the highest concentration of GP PAH at all temperatures relative to the primary alcohols tested, despite a shorter carbon chain length and lower carbon to oxygen ratio than 1-butanol. One possible reason might be that the pyrolysis of 2-propanol may produce species including propargyl radical, vinyl acetylene, acetylene, and 1,3 butadiene [28], which are precursors for aromatic ring formation [1,56,61,62] and PAH growth [63], thus increasing the amount of GP PAH. Figure 5a shows a clear influence at low temperatures (1323 K to 1423 K) of the effect of hydroxyl group position on GP PAH concentration, while at higher temperatures (1523 K to 1623 K) this effect is diminished. A possible explanation for this observation is that at higher temperatures the rates of chemical kinetics are much faster (due to the effective collision of fast-moving particles) [64], with temperature effects thus being dominant compared with any influence of fuel molecular structure. In Fig. 5b, the C2 C4 fuels show much lower concentrations of particle phase (PP) PAHs per unit volume of gas than the corresponding concentrations for the gas phase (GP) PAHs shown in Fig. 5a. A possible explanation is that some of the particle phase (PP) PAHs condensing onto the particulate surface underwent surface reactions or were incorporated (layered) into the particle [65] and were therefore not extractable by the solvent during the ASE process. Figure 5c, shows a high PP PAH concentration for the C3 and C4 fuels at the lowest pyrolysis temperature of 1323 K, but that this concentration decreased drastically when the temperature rose to 1423 K and it decreased further as the temperature reduced to 1523 K. It is suggested that as the temperature rises the PP PAH condensation process onto the particulate surface results not only in adsorbed PAHs that can be subsequently removed through solvent extraction, but also in the incorporation of PAHs into the soot particle structure which can no longer be removed by solvent extraction [60]. The incorporated PAHs may be contributing to the increased mass of soot with increased in temperature, observed in Fig. 4. It is also possible that the decrease in the PP PAHs with increasing temperature is due to a more organised soot micro-texture [66], which makes it less reactive [67] with PAH and thus reducing the amount of adsorbed PP PAHs. The high amount of PP PAHs at 1323 K, might be due to the smaller particle size distribution at 1323 K °C and relatively large total surface area of soot particle presented for the condensation of particle-phase PAHs [45]. The slight increase in the PP PAH in the temperature range of 1523 K to 1623 K, suggested that relatively more mass of PP PAHs was deposited on the soot surface, while the amount of soot reduced with further increases in temperature as shown in Fig. 4. Figure 5c, show that the effect of OH position on the PP PAH was greater in the temperature range of 1323 to 1423 K. At 1323 K, 1-propanol produced approximately three times more PP PAH concentration than 2-propanol, and likewise, 1-butanol produced approximately five times more PP PAH than 2-butanol. A possible explanation for the greater mass of PP PAHs for 1-propanol and 1-butanol at 1323 K is that less carbon is being converted into soot mass as shown in Fig. 4, hence, more carbon was available for PAHs formation at the lowest temperature. Figure 5d shows the ratio of GP PAH to PP PAH. It can be seen that at lower temperatures that the level of GP PAH significantly outweighs that of PP PAH, however, at higher temperatures this ratio drops below 20:1 for all fuels, indicating that the relative consumption of GP PAH to PP PAH and soot has accelerated. Interestingly, Fig. 5d also shows that the ratio of GP to PP PAH is lower for ethanol relative to the longer chained alcohols at all temperatures, perhaps suggesting that the molecular structure of ethanol inhibits the formation of the initial benzene ring and 2 or 3 ring PAHs but does not detrimentally effect rates of larger PAH formation. Reconsidering the GP and PP PAH concentrations shown in Fig. 5a and 4b the GP PAH concentration for the C3 and C4 fuels decreased with increasing temperature, while the PP PAH concentrations were less temperature sensitive. An explanation for these observations might be that the rate of gas-phase GP PAH formation, their growth, and eventual conversion into soot particles was much faster than the rate at which these PAHs condensed onto the soot particle surface, especially since the GP PAHs had considerably lower saturation temperatures than the PP PAHs."
7,"Effects of carbon to oxygen ratio (C/O) on soot mass, GP and PP PAHs","3.3 Effects of carbon to oxygen ratio (C/O) on soot mass, GP and PP PAHs Figure 6 shows the effect of the alcohol carbon to oxygen ratio on the soot mass, and gas-phase and particle Phase PAHs, each normalized against the carbon to oxygen ratio of each alcohol tested (Table 4). It is apparent from Fig. 6a that 2-propanol consistently produces the highest mass of soot at all temperatures except 1323 K, whereas without the normalization a greater mass of soot was produced by 2-butanol at the two lower temperatures tested (Fig. 7 a). Considering the primary alcohols, it can be seen in Fig. 6a that at 1423 K an increase in soot mass with increasing alcohol chain length persists despite normalising of the measured masses (Fig. 4) with an increasing C/O ratio (Table 4), with this effect diminishing at higher temperatures. Figure 6b shows the total gas-phase PAH (µg of PAH/m3 of gas) normalized against the carbon to oxygen ratio of each alcohol. The Figure shows that when GP PAH was normalized with C/O ratio, differences in the mass of GP PAH produced by each fuel persisted but decreased in magnitude at the lowest tested temperature of 1323 K. In particular, it can be seen that the C/O normalised values of GP PAH for the C3 and C4 alcohols are now appreciably lower but still somewhat greater than that displayed by ethanol. At higher temperatures of 1523 K and 1623 K, the effect of carbon to oxygen ratio can be seen to be minimal. Figure 6c shows the total particle-phase PAH (gas and particle phases, µg of PAH/m3 of gas) normalized against the carbon to oxygen ratio of each alcohol. Comparing Fig. 6c with Fig. 5c shows minimal impact on the distribution of PP PAHs when the data for PP PAHs were normalized against the carbon to oxygen ratio. It is interesting to note that the 2-propanol and 1-butanol are brought together at the lowest tested temperature. However, at higher temperatures, above 1423 K, there are no effects on the PP PAHs of molecular structure and C/O ratio. These results reflect a significant effect of temperature the PP PAHs. Figure 7a shows the mass of soot (mg/m3 of gas) plotted against the carbon to oxygen ratio of the alcohol fuel tested. It can be observed from Fig. 7a that the soot mass increased with increase in carbon to oxygen ratio, irrespective of fuel molecular structure due to less oxygen per mole of carbon being available; however, 2-propanol, does not follow this trend, as discussed previously in Section 3.1. It is also evident from Fig. 7a that at constant C/O ratio the secondary alcohols produced more mass of soot than the corresponding primary alcohols, especially in the case of 2-propanol. However, it should be noted that as the C/O ratio increased, the alcohol carbon chain length also increased. Figure 7b shows the total gas-phase PAH (µg of PAH/m3 of gas) plotted against the carbon to oxygen ratio. It can be observed from this Figure a general trend of GP PAHs for all the alcohol fuel molecules to increase up to a C/O ratio of 3 and then slightly decrease at higher ratio. The effect of isomerisation is also evident from Fig. 7b. Figure 7c shows the total particle-phase PAH (µg of PAH/m3 of gas) plotted against the carbon to oxygen ratio. It can be observed from Fig. 7c that PP PAHs increased at the higher C/O ratios, particularly at the lower temperature of 1323 K and less so at the higher temperatures. From the presentation of the above results, it is apparent that there is a relationship between C/O ratio and soot mass, and GP and PP PAHs. It is therefore necessary now to consider possible reasons for this relationship and possible pathways through which this relationship is realised. In this context, however, it should be noted that the oxygen present in the reactor is fuel bound, and it is suggested that it is important to consider whether this oxygen becomes freely available as an oxidizing species or whether it remains carbon-bound. The discussion that follows considers the relationships between C/O and soot mass, GP and PP PAHs in the context of whether the CO bond is likely to break or not. Eveleigh et al. [68] used similar experimental conditions and the same facilities as for this work to evaluate the conversion rates of fuels (ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, acetone, and toluene mixed with n-heptane) to particulate matter (PM). Carbon-13 labelling was employed to label specific carbon atoms in the fuel molecule to 13C, which allowed the determination of the contribution of particular fuel carbon atoms to particulate matter by means of isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The technique allowed carbon atoms that were directly connected to the hydroxyl group (OH) and other oxygen bonds to be traced. It was found that the fuel carbon-oxygen bonds remained mostly intact and the greatest contribution to PM mass came from the fuel carbon atoms that were not bonded to oxygen. For example, for ethanol pyrolysis, the methyl carbon contributed 68% to the PM mass thus suggesting that the oxygen mostly might not be freely available to participate in the reaction pathways and, therefore, the influence of fuel-bound oxygen is likely to be lower on PAH and soot formation, compared with that for free molecular oxygen in reactors running with oxidising conditions. Eveleigh et al. [68] also found that the carbon atom attached to the OH group of 1-propanol and 2-propanol contributed 16% and 22% of the soot mass, respectively, which might be reflected in the difference in soot mass produced by the isomers stated in Section 3.1. According to Westbrook et al. [69], the CO bond in various oxygenated molecules survives the fuel-rich ignition intact, suppressing fuel carbon from forming soot precursors and readily producing carbon monoxide. In the context of compression engine Westbrook et al. [69], suggests that the strong carbon monoxide bond does not break, and thus the carbon and oxygen atoms remains inaccessible for soot production or to impact on soot formation pathways. The above literature therefore suggests that for small alcohols like ethanol, the likelihood is that the CO bond would not break most of the time (around 70%), and hence the low mass of soot for ethanol compared with higher alcohols can not only be attributed to a lower C/O ratio, as it is likely that the low mass of soot is also due to a smaller number of carbon atoms available for soot formation [15,70,71]. As with ethanol, it is also likely that in higher alcohols the oxygen atom merely reserves a carbon atom from forming soot. It is likely therefore that in the case of the alcohols reported in this study, the difference in their C/O ratio may not be the sole or the strongest influence on soot formation, potentially arising from varying ratios of free oxygen and carbon impacting on soot precursor formation pathways; instead, it is likely that increasing fuel carbon chain length has a significant impact in increasing PM mass. Another possibility, accepting the CO bond within the alcohols remained intact, is that the higher soot mass, GP and PP PAHs production, for example from propanol relative to ethanol (Figs. 4 and 5), might be due to increasing available carbon concentration to form soot (given that all experiments were undertaken on a constant total fuel carbon basis of 10,000 ppm). Nevertheless, it is suggested that the probability of this having occurred is likely to be low as the results shown in Fig. 6a, c, and e are normalized with the C/O ratio but continue to show trends of soot, GP, and PP PAHs concentration with increasing carbon chain length, especially at the lower temperatures at which slower reaction rates can be expected. This suggests that the predominant fuel influence when considering the primary alcohols, at conditions at which PAH formation and conversion to soot is to an extent limited by temperature (for example 1323 K and 1423 K in the current study), is likely the alkyl chain length, rather than the available carbon concentration."
8,Effects of alcohol carbon number and OH position on PAH ring distribution,"3.4 Effects of alcohol carbon number and OH position on PAH ring distribution Figure 8 shows the PAH concentration of straight-chain C2 to C4 alcohol fuels grouped based on the number of rings. Figure 8 The results presented in Fig. 8 provide information on the effect of alcohol size and hydroxyl group position on the growth of PAHs. It can be observed from Fig. 8a,b, and c that increasing the alcohol carbon number increased the concentration of PAH of all sizes (as defined by number of rings) at all temperatures. Figure 8 shows that for C3 and C4 alcohol fuels the total PAH concentration (GP + PP) increased from the level for 2 ring species to a maximum level for those with 3 rings, and then decreased progressively in the case of 4, 5, and 6 rings. While in the case of the C2 alcohol, the PAH concentration increased continuously for 2, 3, 4, and 5 rings and then decreased in the case of 6 rings. It is apparent from Fig. 8 that the pyrolysis of C3 and C4 alcohols fuels produced considerably higher concentrations of the three ring PAHs (for example, phenanthrene) as compared to 2, 4, 5 or 6 rings. For example, 1-butanol yielded a significant amount of three ring PAH in the temperature range 1323 K and 1423 K and the concentration of three ring decreased with a further rise in temperature. This suggests rapid growth and subsequent conversion of the 3 ring PAHs into soot particles at higher temperatures (Fig. 8c). The three ring PAHs play an important role in the growth of 4 to 6 rings PAHs, probably due to more growth sites at which a new ring could be added rapidly through the HACA mechanism. It can be seen that for C3 and C4 fuels the PAH ring concentration increased with increase in temperature from 1323 K to 1423 K and tended to decrease between 1523 K to 1623 K, while a contrary trend can be observed for C2 alcohol, between 1523 K and 1623 K. Further, the pyrolysis of ethanol yielded higher concentrations of 3,4 and 5 rings at higher temperatures (Fig. 8a). From Fig. 8b it can be seen that the concentration of two ring PAH remained constant with rising temperatures. Figure 8b and 8c show that the concentration of four ring PAHs were relatively close for the two C3 and C4 fuels despite having different carbon chain lengths and C/O ratios. Considering the heavier PAHs (i.e. those with 5 and 6 rings), Figure 8a,b, and c present that for the C4 alcohol the abundance of heavier ring PAHs was higher than that for the C2 and C3 alcohols. It can be seen that for the C2 at all temperatures the concentration of 5 ring PAHs was higher than that for the 6 ring PAHs. This difference in the concentration of the 5 and 6 ring PAHs could possibly be ascribed to the difference in the conversion rate of these rings to the soot particles. For the C3 fuel, the formation rate of 5 ring PAHs and its growth to 6 rings is reasonably close to each other in the temperature range of 1323 to 1423 K. In Fig. 8d and 8e, the effect of OH position on the ring concentration distribution was very evident in the temperature range of 1323 to 1423 K, with 2-propanol producing higher concentrations of all PAH sizes relative to 1-propanol. For example, 2-propanol produced three times more concentration of 3 ring PAHs as compared to 1-propanol in this temperature range. The higher three ring PAH concentration for where the OH group was present on the second carbon of the C3 alcohol suggests that the conversion of 3 rings PAH to heavier rings PAH was low at lower temperatures [72]. It is clear from Fig. 8e that at the lower temperatures of 1323 K and 1423 K there was an effect on the distribution of rings with 1-butanol, with an accumulation of 3 ring PAH at 1323 K, while in the case of 2-butanol a similar effect on 3 and 4 rings is apparent, albeit at a higher temperature of 1423 K. From the results presented in Fig. 8, it can be concluded that the concentration of the 4,5 and 6 rings PAHs for the C3 and C4 fuels decreased with the rise of pyrolysis temperature from 1323 to 1623 K, while it increased for ethanol."
9,Impact of alcohol carbon number and OH position on individual PAH growth,"3.5 Impact of alcohol carbon number and OH position on individual PAH growth Figure 9 shows the influence of fuel and temperature on the abundance of various individual PAH, either known to be important species in PAH formation mechanisms or to have high relative toxicity. Figure 9 shows the concentration of Naphthalene (NPH), Acenaphthylene (ACY), Phenanthrene (PHN), Pyrene (PYR), Benzo [A] Pyrene (B[a]P), and Benzo [k] Fluoranthene (B[k]F). These PAHs were selected from the cumulative totals by PAH shown in Fig. 8 for further discussion. Figure 9a shows that the concentration of naphthalene increases with an increase in the fuel carbon number in the temperature range of 1323 K to 1423 K, while at higher temperatures the concentration of naphthalene was less effected by the alcohol structure. This might have occurred due to faster conversion with increasing temperature of 2 ring naphthalene to the higher ring PAHs. Ethanol formed its highest concentration of naphthalene at 1523 K while the C3 and C4 alcohol formed their highest amounts at lower temperatures. Comparing now the C3 and C4 alcohol isomers, Figure 9a shows that at the lower temperature of 1523 K both 2-propanol and 2-butanol produced the highest concentrations of naphthalene, while at both the lowest and highest temperatures of 1323 K and 1623 K there is no such distinct influence of the OH position. In the case of the C3 and C4 alcohols, it has been reported that the propargyl radical pathway for the formation of the first aromatic ring is a dominant pathway for propanol and butanol fuel molecules [33,55], where two propargyl radicals recombined to form a first aromatic ring. After the formation of the first aromatic ring, the benzene ring loses a hydrogen atom, resulting in a phenyl radical which could readily form two-ring naphthalene via the HACA mechanism [62,73]. Although the formation of naphthalene via the HACA mechanism is dominant, it could also be formed by recombining cyclopentadienyl radicals [1]. Once the two-ring naphthalene has been formed, it further grows to three rings acenaphthylene and phenanthrene via the HACA mechanism as shown in Fig. 9b and 9c. In Fig. 9b, the C2 fuel produced a low concentration of acenaphthylene as compared to the C3 and C4 fuel. From Fig. 9b the effect of OH position was notable in the temperature range of 1323 K to 1423 K. For example, at 1323 K, 2-propanol produced almost double the acenaphthylene concentration as compared to 1-propanol, while at 1323 K 1-butanol produced twice the concentration of acenaphthylene as compared to 2-butanol at the same temperature. Figure 9c shows that in the temperature range of 1323 K to 1423 K the concentration of phenanthrene increased with increasing alcohol carbon number. It also shows that 2-propanol produced a higher concentration of phenanthrene at 1323 K and 1423 K than 1-propanol. For example, at 1323 K, 2-propanol produced more than four times the concentration of phenanthrene as compared to 1-propanol. As shown in Fig. 9c, the concentration of phenanthrene is high for 1-butanol at 1323 K and 1523 K, while at 1423 K and 1623 K 2-butanol had a higher concentration. Either the benzenoid phenanthrene or three ring acenaphthylene could grow to form pyrene. From Fig. 9d, it can be seen that the concentration of phenanthrene in all the test fuels tended to be higher than that for acenaphthylene at the low temperature range of 1323 to 1423 K and at higher temperatures the contrary trend can be observed. It is therefore suggested that at lower temperatures pyrene growth via phenanthrene dominates through the HACA mechanism, while at higher temperatures pyrene growth is mostly via acenaphthylene. The effect of temperature on the formation of phenanthrene has been reported in a modelling study [74]. The kinetic modelling shows that the pathway of phenanthrene formation from naphthalene could be observed at the lower temperature while the conversion of naphthalene to acenaphthylene became the more favourable pathway beyond 1000 K [74]. Figure 9e shows that all the test fuels produced a substantial amount of pyrene at all temperatures, suggested to be attributable to all the 2 ring and 3 ring PAHs growing via pyrene to form heavier PAH, especially the B2 group (high toxicity group) by the HACA or HAVA mechanisms. Other possible pathways are the PAC (Phenyl addition and cyclization and MAC (methyl addition cyclization) [75,76]. It can be seen from Fig. 9f and 9g that in the case of ethanol pyrolysis the concentration of benzo[a] pyrene and benzo[k] fluoranthene increased with increasing temperature while for C3 and C4 pyrolysis the concentration of benzo[a] pyrene and benzo[k] fluoranthene decreased with increasing temperature."
10,PAH toxicity index,"3.6 PAH toxicity index This section evaluates the carcinogenicity of the particulate generated from the test fuels at different temperatures and mainly focuses on the B2 group PAHs due to their high toxicity level. A PAH toxicity index was calculated as the sum of the products of the concentration (Ci) of individual PAHs and their individual toxicity equivalent factor (TEF), as shown in Eq. (1). Nisbet and LaGoy (1992) [42] proposed TEFs as found in Table 1, and are widely used to estimate PAH toxicity. (1) Toxicity index = ∑ i = 1 n ( TEFi * Ci ) The PAH toxicity of the C2 C4 alcohols series fuels on a mass of soot basis is shown in Fig. 10 . It can be observed from Fig. 10 that at the lowest temperature all the tested fuels exhibit very different toxicity levels, while it is interesting to see how close at the calculated toxicity of particulates from each fuel is at higher temperatures. It is apparent from Fig. 10 that 1-propanol had the highest toxicity at 1323 K. For example, the toxicity of 1-propanol at 1323 K was 1.6 times of 2-propanol, 2.2 times that of 1-butanol and 10.8 times that of 2-butanol. The high toxicity of the 1-propanol soot at 1323 K, can be attributed to a relatively high concentration of toxic benzo [a] pyrene condensing onto the soot particles. At this point, it is important to mention that the toxicity level increased 10 times in each PAH growth step from acenaphthylene to benzo [a] anthracene and then to most toxic benzo[a] pyrene. The contribution of other B2 group species to the high toxicity of 1-propanol toxicity can be found as supplementary data, Table S5 and Table S6. The low ring number PAHs possessing low carcinogenicity, and which are classified as group D (low toxicity group), were present at relatively low concentrations on the soot mass collected. The low ring PAHs have high vapour pressure and low boiling point as compared to the B2 group. Therefore, the group D PAHs may have a low condensation rate on the soot surface [54]. 2-propanol has the second highest toxicity at 1323 K while ethanol has the lowest. However, at the highest tested temperature, ethanol has the highest toxicity. It is interesting to note that the primary alcohols are more toxic than the corresponding secondary alcohols at the lowest and highest temperatures. Finally, it is interesting to note that at the lower temperatures of 1323 to 1423 K the abundance of soot mass is relatively low for all fuels as can be seen in Fig. 4, however Fig. 10 shows that the toxicity of the extractable PAHs condensing on the soot particles was much higher than it was at temperatures higher than 1423 K. This observation suggests that low temperature combustion systems which are designed for reducing NOx, might at the same time produce more toxic particulates."
11,Conclusions,"The influence of carbon number and hydroxyl group position in short chain alcohols on the mass of soot formed and the mass and composition of the 16 priority PAH, listed by the EPA, at pyrolytic conditions was investigated in a high temperature tube reactor. To investigate the effects of alkyl chain length, ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol were chosen, while the secondary alcohols (2-propanol and 2-butanol) were included to provide insight as to the effects of OH position along a straight alkyl chain. All experiments were conducted at a consistent fuel inlet concentration of 10,000 ppm on C1 basis at a constant residence time of t(s) = 4479/T, and at a temperature range from 1323 to 1623 K at ambient pressure. The results obtained showed that alkyl chain length, C/O ratio, and hydroxyl group position had an impact on the total soot mass produced from the pyrolysis of the alcohol fuels. The soot mass concentration increased with carbon number, which was expected given the increase in the C/O ratio. Normalisation with the alcohol C/O ratio continued to show lower soot mass in the case of ethanol relative to 1-propanol and 1-butanol at 1423 K, suggestive of an influence of alkyl chain length further to that of determining the C/O ratio of each fuel. The secondary alcohols (2-propanol and 2-butanol) consistently generated higher soot mass as compared to primary alcohols (1-propanol and 1-butanol), which is likely attributable to higher rates of decomposition to soot precursors in the case of the secondary alcohols. Increasing alcohol carbon number had an appreciable impact on the GP PAH concentration, with ethanol pyrolysis resulting in a significantly lower GP PAH concentration relative to that for 1-propanol and 1-butanol at all temperatures; this observation remained valid when normalising with C/O ratio, with the exception of the highest temperature of 1623 K. The effect of hydroxyl group position on the GP and PP concentration was noticeable in the lower temperature range of 1323 to 1423 K. Meanwhile, the concentration of PAH rings increased with an increase in alcohol carbon number. It was found that the pyrolysis of C3 and C4 alcohols fuels produced considerably higher concentrations of the three ring PAHs as compared to 2, 4, 5, or 6 rings, with concentrations of the former peaking at 1323 to 1423 K before decreasing appreciably at higher temperatures. This rapid formation and apparent consumption are suggestive of the significant role of the three ring PAH in the subsequent formation of 4 to 6 rings PAHs and soot particles. It was observed that the pyrene formation pathway was temperature dependant and was mainly dominated by phenanthrene in the temperature range of 1323 K to 1423 K, as indicated by a high ratio of phenanthrene to acenaphthylene for all of the C2 to C4 alcohols. However, at higher temperatures of 1523 K to 1623 K pyrene formation was mainly via the acenaphthylene pathway, with a significant reduction in the ratio of phenanthrene to acenaphthylene observed. A significant impact of pyrolysis temperature on the calculated toxicity of the particulates was apparent, with a greater abundance of toxic PAHs at low temperature, despite lower temperatures producing smaller soot mass concentrations. The highest toxicity of all the short chain alcohols investigated was observed in the case of 1-propanol at 1323 K, attributable to a relative concentration of benzo[a]pyrene. At the highest temperature of 1623 K, differences in particulate toxicity arising from changes in fuel composition were less apparent, with the highest level exhibited by ethanol. The presented results showed that there are significant effects of fuel molecular structure on the formation of soot and PAHs, and thus potential implications for air quality and public health in the development of future alcohol based fuels. However, to better understand the influence of the OH group on the decomposition reaction pathways it is recommended that further investigations determine fuel effects on the abundance of smaller hydrocarbons intermediate and precursor species, such as acetylene, propyne, 1,3 butadiene, and benzene, towards mitigating these impacts through fuel design and optimisation of combustion processes."
