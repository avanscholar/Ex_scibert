0,Introduction,"In the current scenario, the valorization of biomass has attracted much attention due to the widespread applications as value-added chemical intermediates, biofuels, and biomaterials [1]. The extensive utilization of biomass for versatile industrial applications is owing to the cost efficiency and eco-friendly nature [2]. In this context, biomass-derived lignin and cellulose emerged as a renewable feedstock for the extraction of essential fine chemicals such as acetophenone (AP) and 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO) respectively [3,4]. γ-butyrolactone (GBL) is commonly used as a clean solvent, intermediate in the manufacture of rubber additives, precursor for 2-pyrrolidone, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and herbicides [5]. Conventionally, GBL can be synthesized in two ways, either by the maleic anhydride (MA) hydrogenation or from the 1,4-BDO dehydrogenative cyclization [6,7]. However, the MA hydrogenation is not an environmentally benign process due to the emission of CO2. Consequently, dehydrogenative cyclization of 1,4-BDO attracted more attention owing to the cost-effective manufacture of GBL from renewable biomass. To date, a variety of Cu-based catalysts on different supports have been extensively investigated for the dehydrogenation of 1,4-BDO. For instance, Cu-Cr-Mn [8], Cu-ZnO-ZrO2-Al2O3 [7], Cu-ZnO-Al2O3 [5], Cu/MgO [9], Cu-SiO2 [10] and Cu/CeO2 [11] respectively. Nevertheless, the GBL selectivity apparently relies on the basic sites and the ratio of Cu°/Cu+ ions present in the active catalyst. In contrast, acidic sites present in the catalyst show a great impact on the synthesis of tetrahydrofuran (THF) via cyclic dehydration pathway [12]. 1-pheylethanol (PhE) is used as an important pharmaceutical ingredient in the synthesis of ibuprofen and fragrance intermediate in the perfume industry [13]. In this regard, catalytic hydrogenation of AP provides a significant approach for the synthesis of PhE. In recent years, several noble metal catalysts containing Pt [13], Pd [14], Ru [15], Rh [16] have been developed for AP hydrogenation. However, these catalysts are highly cost-effective, less abundant for large-scale production thereby paving the way for the synthesis of inexpensive non-noble metal catalysts. Commercially, the Rani Ni catalyst has been employed, which is environmentally not benign and has low selectivity due to the formation of other by-products [17]. Therefore, it is essential to improve the yield of PE by applying suitable economical catalysts. Cu-based heterogeneous catalysts have been proved to perform excellent activity for selective hydrogenation of AP into PhE [18]. However, the acidic/basic nature of the support and the surface ratio of Cu°/Cu+ ions present in the active catalyst influence the selectivity of PhE [19]. Nevertheless, some unsolved issues are typically noticed in the individual 1,4-BDO dehydrogenation and AP hydrogenation in both the liquid and vapor phase reaction conditions. For instance, mild product selectivity, facile catalyst deactivation high-energy utilization and harsh reaction conditions. In this context, researchers are exploring an alternative and effective reaction condition with diverse catalytic systems. In recent years, the coupling of two dehydrogenation-hydrogenation reactions on a unique catalyst in the same reactor system has received more attention due to time-saving nature, cost efficiency, low energy consumption, high product yield, and H2 economy [20]. Therefore, direct catalytic coupling reactions using 1,4-BDO as a sustainable hydrogen source, emerged as an alternative route for the synthesis of a variety of fine-chemicals [21–26]. In view of that, gas-phase direct coupling of 1,4-BDO and AP has performed over Cu-based catalysts at atmospheric pressure [25]. Among them, MgO supported Cu catalysts have exhibited remarkable activity and high selectivity to produce GBL and PhE respectively. MgO is an environmentally benign solid base, extremely used as an adsorbent, catalyst, and support for various catalytic reactions under mild conditions [27]. Commercial MgO is a fine powder obtained by the thermal decomposition of MgCO3 or Mg(OH)2 which has several disadvantages such as low specific surface area, irregular morphology, and grain size. Therefore, porous MgO with a high specific surface area has been synthesized by various methods such as sol-gel, CVD, a hard-template technique using SBA-15 and CMK-3, etc [28]. However, these approaches are not only expensive but also time-consuming for practical catalytic applications. In comparison with the synthetic templates, naturally available biomaterials are cheap with a diverse hierarchical structure. Among them, rice grains as exo-template is a convenient approach for the synthesis of biomorphic MgO/carbon with desirable BET surface area and adequate basic properties [29]. Herein, the first time we explored the superior activity of biomorphic MgO/Carbon supported Cu catalysts for the vapor phase direct coupling of 1,4-bdo dehydrogenation and AP hydrogenation. Furthermore, individual dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions also executed on the same catalysts and the activity results are compared with the coupling reaction. The present study describes a simple, cost-effective synthesis of MgO/Carbon supported Cu nanoparticles for the simultaneous production of more value-added products under industrially viable conditions."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of Cu/C-MgO materials,"2.1 Synthesis of Cu/C-MgO materials Biomorphic MgO/Carbon was prepared in accordance with the original report by Ma et al. [29]. In this preparation, magnesium acetate tetrahydrate [(Mg (Ac)2 4H2O, Sigma Aldrich, 98 %] and rice grains used as raw material for magnesia and high surface area carbon precursors respectively. Typically, 10 g of Mg (Ac)2 4H2O transferred in a beaker was dissolved in 20 mL of ultrapure millipore water, 20 g of rice grains are mixed to the above solution and sealed with a glass lid. The resulted mixture heated on a heating plate until the aqueous solution is totally absorbed by rice grains. The obtained solid magnesium acetate-rice mixture was dried overnight at ambient temperature and thermally treated at 773 K under N2 gas flow (4.2 L/h) for 3 h following complete carbonization at 983 K for 1 h. The synthesized MgO/Carbon composite after carbonization at 973 K is dark in colour. The finally obtained biomorphic MgO/Carbon was labelled as C-MgO. A series of Cu/C-MgO catalytic materials are synthesized by impregnation method using Cu (NO3)2 3H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9 %) as a copper precursor and C-MgO as support. In this preparation C-MgO used as active support for synthesis of different Cu loading catalysts by using the required amount of aqueous copper nitrate solution. The above solution is stirred continuously for 4 h at ambient temperature and the excess of water is removed by using a rotatory evaporator. The attained solid was further dried at 343 K for 12 h in a vacuum oven and followed by thermal activation at 623 K for 4 h under N2 flow (99.999 % pure). The obtained catalysts are indicated as 5Cu/C-MgO, 10Cu/C-MgO, 15Cu/C-MgO, and 20Cu/C-MgO respectively."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The specific XRD analysis of all the samples characterized on a Rigaku Ultima-IV XRD instrument furnished with a Ni filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.54 Å). All the diffractograms were acquired in the 2θ range from 10 to 80° with an interval of 0.01° and a scan rate of 1° min−1 operating at a current of 20 mA and 40 kV voltage. To properly explore the crystalline phase, the typical XRD patterns were compared with standard compounds available in the PDF-2 ICDD database. The Cu crystallite size of catalyst samples is determined by substitution of the peak height at a half of the maxima value in the Scherrer’s equation. The N2-BET surface area of all catalysts including the support material taken on a ASAP 2020 (M/s. Micrometrics corp., USA) unit by the sorption of N2 at 77 K. Prior to BET analysis, degasification treatment of samples was done at 423 K for 4 h to extract the residual gases and moisture content. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation was applied to measure the surface area of all the copper catalysts including C-MgO support. The pore size distribution values are calculated from desorption curve employing BJH method, and the total pore volume (Vtotal) is obtained at the relative pressure (P/P0) value of 0.99. The reduction patterns of Cu/MgO/C catalysts carried out on an Auto Chem 2950 chemisorption analyser (M/s. Micrometrics, USA). The reduction performance of CuO clusters existing in the thermally activated Cu/C-MgO catalysts was promptly investigated by H2-TPR. Briefly, 100 mg of the sample loaded in a narrow quartz tube and increased the temperature up to 900 K with a heat ramping of 10 K min−1 in the presence of 5% H2/Ar flow (30 mL/min). The amount of H2 ingested during the reduction was analysed by a TCD detector properly calibrated with Ag2O. The surface basic strength of the catalyst is assessed by the CO2-TPD using a 10 % CO2 balanced He gas mixture. In general, 100 mg of the Cu material placed in a U-shaped quartz tube and exposed to 10 % CO2/He mixture gas with a flow rate of 30 mL/min for about 30 min. Consequently, the sample is purged with He (99.999 %) gas at a mild temperature of 373 K for 1 h to eliminate physically adsorbed CO2 and moisture. At that point, the sample temperature was gradually raised from 373 to 1173 K in 20 mL/min He gas flow. The specified amount of CO2 desorbed was observed by the TCD equipped GC with at a constant heating of 10 K per minute. Thermal analysis (TGA-DSC) of the samples was measured using a NETZSCH STA 449 F1 Jupiter thermal analyser under Ar from 300 to 900 K at a heat ramp of 10 K min−1. The amount of copper loading present in the samples was accurately measured by using the icap6500duo ICP-OES Analyzer (M/s. Thermo Scientific, USA). Before the ICP-OES analysis, the desired amount of Cu catalytic material was dissolved in aquaregia and prepared a stock solution. The surface morphological features and the unique distribution of active particles among the catalyst samples were properly investigated by electron microscopy measurements. The conventional FE-SEM analysis is carried out on a JEOL JSM 5600 microscope equipped with a secondary electron detector and a tungsten filament as an electron source. Additionally, the elementary composition of the specific sample is detected by employing an Oxford Inca EDX system. The TEM analysis of Cu samples carried out on an electron microscope JEOL JEM 2000EXII operating at a standard voltage of 180 kV. The Cu material is well dispersed in methanol solvent under sonication and placed a drop of methanol on copper grids coated with carbon. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of Cu samples are characterized on a Kratos Axis 165 Surface Analysis System at a base pressure of 1 × 10−9 mbar. Prior to the XPS analysis, all the samples were reduced under H2 flow at 523 K for 3 h. The pre-reduced samples were carefully placed in the analyser and excited with Mg Kα monochromatic radiation (hυ=1253.6 eV) functioning in a constant-pass energy mode (20 eV). The specific B.E values of all the active elements corrected by considering C1 s XPS peak (284.6 eV) as a standard reference with a possible precision of ±0.1 eV. N2O pulse chemisorption analysis is performed on a micro quartz reactor generally attached to a multi-port sampling value and a GC having TCD connected to a Porapak-T column. In a typical procedure, around mass of 100 mg catalyst is pre-heated gently at 523 K for 1 h under He (99.999 % pure) followed by reduction in 5%H2/Ar gas mixture at the same temperature for 3 h. Subsequently, the sample was cooled down to 363 K, and the pulse chemisorption was done by injecting 6% N2O/He mixture gas on the active catalyst using a 6-port valve in the TCD signal. The number of moles of surface Cu atoms undergoes reaction with N2O assumed in accordance with the following stoichiometric equation [30]. N 2 O g +2 C u s → N 2 g +C u 2 O s The Cu dispersion (DCu) is precisely assessed as the percentage of total number of surface atoms of Cu to the whole Cu atoms present in one-gram mass of the sample. The metal surface area of copper (SCu) was measured by multiplying the Cu metal area of cross-section (6.803 × 10−20 m2) with the number of surface atoms of Cu per 1 g catalyst. The Cu particle size (PCu) is determined assuming spherical shape of the metal particles by the following equation: (1) P a r t i c l e S i z e , ( P C u , n m ) = % C u l o a d i n g × 6 × 10 3 100 × ρ × D C u"
4,Results and discussion,
5,Thermo gravimetric analysis,"3.1 Thermo gravimetric analysis The TG analysis of oven-dried magnesium acetate/rice grains sample was carried out under N2 flow and the corresponding thermogram is shown in Fig. 1 . The weight loss of about 10 % in the decomposition temperature region of 303−473 K is ascribed to the physisorbed water. The major weight loss (∼62 %) up to 723 K with two endothermic DSC curves can be distinguished at 583 K and 623 K can be ascribed to the gradual decomposition of rice grains and magnesium acetate respectively. The smooth decrease of weight fraction to 6% with temperature increase up to 973 K indicates the carbonization of organic species present in the mixture. Furthermore, the homogenous distribution of MgO particles into the black carbon matrix derived from rice grains takes place during the pyrolysis. The calculation based on weight loss from the TGA results indicates that MgO content in the resultant MgO/Carbon composite (C-MgO) is about 31 %."
6,Powder X-Ray diffraction (XRD),"3.2 Powder X-Ray diffraction (XRD) The XRD of calcined Cu/C-MgO samples (Fig. 2 a) display well-resolved patterns at 2θ values of 35.52°, 38.68°, 48.76°, 58.16°, 66.23°, and 68.03° respectively. The diffraction patterns confirm the existence of CuO phase (JCPDS No. 05−661) [30]. In addition, the presence of the crystalline MgO phase also observed at 42.82°, 62.24°, and 78.52° (JCPDS card No. 04-829) with corresponding d spacing at 2.11 nm, 1.49 nm and 1.22 nm, respectively. The gradual rise in the intensity of CuO in X-ray diffraction lines observed at 2θ values of 35.52°, 38.68°, and 48.76° with increasing in the copper content from 5 to 20 wt.%. In contrast, calcined catalysts with lower Cu loading (<10 wt.%) show crystalline MgO phase and poorly marked X-ray diffractions of CuO. The effect of Cu loading on CuO/MgO X-ray intensity ratio of calcined catalysts is illustrated in the supplementary information (Fig. S1). The intercept of the straight line on to the X-axis intersects at ∼4 wt% Cu, where the intensity ratio is zero. The XRD results typically demonstrate that CuO possesses amorphous nature up to 4 wt% Cu loading in the catalyst sample. The XRD of reduced Cu/C-MgO catalysts (Fig. 2b) exhibit diffraction patterns at 2θ values of 43.41°, 50.53°, and 74.18° with corresponding d values of 2.09 nm, 1.81 nm, and 1.28 nm respectively confirm the presence of Cu° phase (JCPDS Card No. 04-836). However, the d values of Cu° at 43.40° (d = 2.09 nm) and MgO at 42.82° (d = 2.11 nm) are extremely close, so the diffraction lines are unseparated properly in the XRD. The peak intensities of reduced Cu catalysts significantly raised after a gradual increase in the Cu loading from 5 to 20 wt.%. The Cu crystallite size in the reduced catalysts measured from the Scherrer’s formula and the resulting values are shown in the Table 1 . From Fig.S1 (supplementary information), there is a continuous decreasing trend of Cu/MgO ratio which is in line with Cu loading. The point of intersection on the X-axis reveals that the metallic Cu is in the amorphous phase up to 2 wt.% Cu loading in the reduced samples. The apparent deviation in the X-axis intercept values for both calcined and reduced samples (Fig.S1) ascribed to the reorganization of Cu and MgO phases during the H2 reduction process. The crystallite size of Cu in the reduced and spent catalyst (not shown here) for combination reactions shows not much difference, indicating that there is no any agglomeration of Cu particles during the reaction. Boudart et al. investigated that magnesia could stabilize the metal particles so as to prevent sintering and volatilization [31]."
7,H2-TPR,"3.3 H2-TPR The H2-TPR reduction profiles of the freshly prepared Cu/C-MgO catalysts of various copper loadings are illustrated in Fig. 3 a, which shows a single broad reduction peak at 584, 596, 598, and 610 K respectively. Several literature reports suggest this kind of single-stage reduction of CuO species on the MgO support may be ascribed to the complete reduction of CuO → Cu° [9,18]. The reduction behaviour of the samples suggests that synergism between the metal and support declined with the addition of Cu loading. On comparison, it can justify that 5Cu/C-MgO, 10Cu/C-MgO catalyst samples have enhanced dispersion of active Cu2+ species within the MgO support. It further confirms the copper dispersion tends to minimize with more Cu metal loadings, which is reliable with the N2O pulse chemisorption results. It is equally evident that the reduction peak is shifted to a more elevated temperature with rising in Cu content which can be attributed to the formation of bulk copper oxide at higher loadings [32]. The obtained H2-TPR patterns are consistent with XRD analysis (Fig. 2) which suggests the increase in the crystallite size of CuO with Cu content. Moreover, the H2 utilization rate is raised regularly as shown in Table 1. The reduction of 5Cu/MgO, 10Cu/C-MgO and 15Cu/C-MgO catalyst samples with an intense broad peak centered at ∼597 K indicates the presence of easily reducible Cu2+ species. It is reported that surface defect sites present in the MgO facilitate the formation of well-dispersed CuO that undergoes reduction at lower temperatures [33,34]. Similar behaviour is also observed with Cu/Al2O3 in which the lowering of reduction temperature attributed to the formation of a surface aluminate (CuAl2O4) species, which readily reduces to Cu° even at 523−623 K [35]."
8,CO2 TPD,"3.4 CO2 TPD The total basicity of Cu/C-MgO samples was analyzed by TPD of CO2 in the temperature region of 373–1023 K and the results are illustrated in Fig. 3b. The pure C-MgO support exhibits three well-resolved desorption patterns for the weak, moderate, and strong basic sites at 580, 730, and 890 K respectively. The weak basic sites attributed to the release of bicarbonates formed on Bronsted OH groups. Meanwhile, desorption of bidentate carbonates from Mg-O pairs and unidentate carbonates from low coordination oxygen ions are responsible for moderate and strong basic sites respectively [33]. As mentioned earlier, the template effect of biomorphic carbon increases the dispersion of MgO and produces strong basic sites over the surface. It is exposed that CO2 desorption and the strength of basic sites decrease dramatically with an increase in copper loading (Table 1). This can be ascribed to the generation of acidic nature from the CuO decreases the strength of medium and stronger basic sites [12]."
9,BET surface area and pore size distribution,"3.5 BET surface area and pore size distribution Cu/C-MgO samples exhibit N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms (Fig. 4 a) with characteristic type-I hysteresis loops, indicating the presence of the microporous structure of carbon in the samples. The BET surface areas of C-MgO and Cu/C-MgO catalysts are presented in Table 1, as assessed from their N2 sorption isotherms. C-MgO sample shows a high surface area of 304 m2/g, clearly demonstrates the template effect of rice grains for the generation of porous MgO [36]. After incorporation of copper, the specific surface area decreases gradually from 261 to 153 m2/g with an increment in the Cu loading from 5 to 20 wt.% respectively. This indicates that Cu/C-MgO samples contain a certain amount of bigger copper particles resides outside of micropores may block pores and decreases the specific surface area. The BJH pore size distribution curves were acquired from the desorption branch of N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms are displayed in Fig. 4b. The PSD curve of C-MgO sample comprises narrow pore size distribution in the range of 2−10 nm can be ascribed to the mesoporous MgO. This unusual PSD pattern is obviously altered from that of MgO prepared by the direct thermal dissociation of magnesium acetate [37]. The PSD curve of Cu/C-MgO samples exhibits similar patterns with the support that indicates the structure is retained even after incorporation of metal into the support."
10,N2O pulse chemisorption,"3.6 N2O pulse chemisorption N2O pulse chemisorption is used to identify i) the total amount of surface atoms of Cu, ii) Cu metal dispersion (DCu), iii) surface area of Cu metal (SCu) and iv) particle size of Cu (PCu). The obtained N2O chemisorption results for all the copper catalyst samples are summarized in Table 3. It can be clearly observed the particle size (PCu) values calculated from N2O chemisorption are almost in agreement with the crystallite size obtained from XRD of reduced catalysts (Table 1). Additionally, the number of surface copper atoms and Cu metal surface area (SCu) is enhanced with the addition of copper content from 5 to 10 wt.%, then diminished after further increase up to 20 wt.% Cu. This decreasing tendency indicates that sintering may take place on the catalyst surface when the Cu loading is greater than 10 wt.% and therefore the metallic surface area (SCu) of the catalyst also reduced. In contrast, increasing tendency in the particle size (PCu) with the copper amount from 5 to 20 wt.% may be due to the agglomeration of active Cu metallic species on the support medium. On contrary, a gradual decrease in the metal dispersion is observed possibly because of weak metal-support interactions onto the support environment. Moreover, particle size of the metal also impacts the rate of dispersion which is consistent with the XRD and TPR results (section 3.2 &3.3). The N2O pulse chemisorption results endorsed that 10Cu/C-MgO catalyst to be the best among all the tested samples owing to the optimal Cu dispersion (DCu) and high metal surface area of Cu (SCu)."
11,X-ray phoelectron spectra (XPS),"3.7 X-ray phoelectron spectra (XPS) The Cu 2p spectra of in-situ reduced Cu/C-MgO samples under H2 are typically presented in Fig.S2 (supplementary information) and their corresponding B.E. values of Cu, Mg, and O are listed in Table 2 . As shown in the figure, a characteristic intense peak around 932.8–933.6 eV (Cu 2p3/2) among all the samples clearly suggests the presence of either Cu° or Cu+ in the near-surface-region. Based on the XRD and TPR results, the copper oxide species in all the catalysts are expected to be completely reduced into metallic copper at 280 °C. In addition, no satellite peak within the region of 940−943 eV, further support the absence of Cu2+ and confirm the primary existence of metallic Cu or Cu+ species over the catalyst surface, as described in the literature [38]. Typically, satellite peaks in XPS are gained because of the shakeup of transitions by charge transfer between ligand to metal 3d orbitals. The presence of satellite is characteristic for Cu2+ compounds but not seen in metallic Cu or Cu+ compounds as the 3d orbitals are filled [39]. From Table 2, the core-level O 1s spectra exhibits two well fitted broad bands after deconvolution in the range of 530–533 eV and the Mg 2p B.E value is almost 51 eV for all the samples. Therefore, it can be ascertained there is no observable variation of surface concentration of MgO with the addition of Cu loading. The lower binding energy values of 10Cu/C-MgO may be due to the strong metal-support interaction. Further, the pronounced enrichment of Cu/Mg atomic ratio in the 10Cu/C-MgO catalyst can be ascribed to the active presence of large amounts of Cu° species on the surface compared to other samples [40].The presence of highly dispersed metallic copper species in the active catalyst is also consistent with the N2O chemisorption results."
12,Electron microscopy analysis,"3.8 Electron microscopy analysis SEM image and EDAX spectrum of biomorphic MgO/Carbon (C-MgO) prepared after pyrolysis at 773 K and successive carbonization at 973 K are presented in the supplementary information (Fig. S3). Nevertheless, it shows the presence of various randomly distributed gibbous particles illustrates the carbon features derived from the template. Whereas, the particles agglomerated with urchin-like structure should be attributed to the surplus MgO present on the surface. It is previously reported that calcination followed by carbonization treatment creates micropores in the MgO/Carbon sample [29]. However, due to the limitation of the SEM instrument, we can only differentiate the variation of micropores which facilitate a rise in the surface area of the sample, as mentioned in Table 1. The chemical composition of the C-MgO specimen display signals as corresponding to Mg, O and, C, respectively (Fig. S3, supplementary information). The amount of MgO (wt. %) calculated from EDAX analysis is typical ∼31 %, which is in good agreement with the TGA results. The TEM image of biomorphic C-MgO displayed in Fig. S4 (supplementary information), which clearly indicates the surface coverage of MgO particles over the carbon matrix throughout the sample. The high-resolution TEM image revealed the lattice fringes with periodic d-spacing of 2.1 Å assigning to the 200 plane of the MgO nanoparticles plane [41]. Furthermore, the HRTEM image of biomorphic C-MgO showed that the MgO particle size about 5−6 nm, which is reliable with the powder XRD measurements (5.5 nm, Table 1)."
13,"Dehydrogenation of 1,4-Butanediol (1,4-BDO)","As per the literature, the proposed reaction pathway for the dehydrogenative cyclization of 1,4-BDO to GBL on Cu/C-MgO catalysts was illustrated in Scheme 1 . Initially, 1,4-BDO was dehydrogenated to 4-hydroxybutanal (4-HB) with a loss of one mole of hydrogen. Subsequently, 4-HB rapidly undergoes hemi-acetalization to give 2-hydroxytetrahydrofuran (HTHF). The HTHF was further undergoing dehydrogenation with the second loss of hydrogen leading to GBL [7,12]. In summary, dehydrogenation of 1 mol 1,4-BDO produces 1 mol GBL and 2 mol of H2, while the catalytic dehydration of 1,4-BDO generates THF and water respectively. As shown in Scheme 1, the selective dehydrogenation of 1,4-BDO into GBL is challenging due to the THF formation by an endothermic dehydration reaction. The 1,4-BDO dehydrogenation activity depends on the copper metal surface area, the number of acidic/basic sites, and the ratio of Cu0/Cu+ ions in the active catalyst. In most cases, it is believed that THF can be extensively produced on the acid catalyst. Nevertheless, the Cu0 active species can catalyze dehydrogenative cyclization reaction of into GBL. Whereas electropositive Cu+ ions may function as Lewis acid sites and accountable for the formation of THF through dehydration pathway [12]. Initially, a blank run was carried out with the quartz sieves as an inert reaction medium and no observable change in the conversion of 1,4-BDO was observed. The catalytic reactions are carried out in a micro-reactor linked to a TCD equipped GC as reported elsewhere [42] to confirm the evolution of in-situ H2 along with GBL. To find out the finest temperature and Cu catalyst for the 1,4-BDO dehydrogenation, activity tests were carried out over all the copper catalysts in the temperature range of 473–573 K (Fig. 5 a). It clearly shows that the dehydrogenation activity of Cu/C-MgO catalysts increased linearly with temperature up until 523 K for all copper loadings. With a further rise in temperature, conversion of 1,4-BDO drops progressively which is ascribed to the aggregation of metallic Cu particles. In addition, coke deposition may take place at higher temperatures due to the cracking of the reactant molecule on the catalyst surface. Likewise, the selectivity to GBL also tends to decrease in a similar fashion beyond 523 K (Fig. 5b). This can be attributed to the formation of THF by dehydration at elevated temperatures as shown in Fig. S5 (supplementary information). The influence of copper content on the dehydrogenation activity of the Cu/C-MgO catalysts has been investigated under similar reaction conditions, and results including the TOF values are illustrated in Table 3 . It can be carefully observed that the conversion of 1,4-BDO increased dramatically with the copper amount from 5 to 10 wt.% and then reduced with a further rise in the copper content. The gradual diminish in the conversion for 15 and 20 wt.% Cu catalysts is due to lesser number of surface-active Cu atoms evidenced by N2O chemisorption. Similarly, the reaction rate also follows a similar trend and reached a maximum of 6.225 × 10−5 mol. g-1. s-1 (entry 2, Table 3) for 10Cu/C-MgO and then decreased gradually. It is noteworthy the yield of GBL increased linearly with the metal surface area of copper in the dehydrogenation of 1,4-BDO over the Cu/C-MgO catalysts (Fig. 6 & Table 3). The correlation between the metal surface area and dehydrogenation activity of ethanol has been reported over the supported Cu catalysts [43]. The reaction activity is majorly depends on number Cu atoms available/participate in the 1,4-BDO dehydrogenation. Additionally, the turnover frequency (TOF) calculated at 523 K improved dramatically from 209 × 10-3 to 429 × 10-3 mol. s-1 per Cu atom when the metal particle size increases from 16.5–43.4 nm. Consequently, there is a gradual decrease in the GBL selectivity with increasing in the Cu loading. This could be ascribed to the generation of acidic sites at higher Cu loadings which diminish the strength of the surface basicity (Table 1). Based on the above results, 10Cu/C-MgO typically operating at 523 K can be treated as the best catalyst to get significant activity and selectivity."
14,Hydrogenation of acetophenone (AP),"To perceive the experimental conditions of the coupled reaction, individual AP hydrogenation was carried out using external H2 over Cu/C-MgO catalysts at atmospheric pressure. As mentioned in Scheme 2 , the reaction involves hydrogenation of carbonyl group followed by hydrogenolysis of PhE into EB. Therefore, it is crucial to improve the PhE selectivity by adopting suitable catalyst composition and reaction specifications. The effect of reaction temperature on the AP hydrogenation activity for the series of Cu/C-MgO catalysts (5−20 wt.%) was graphically represented in Fig. 6a. It can be observed that when the temperature is increased from 473 to 498 K the conversion of AP is virtually constant among all the samples. However, there was a great fall in the specific activity above 498 K owing to the exothermic character of catalytic AP hydrogenation. The fractional conversion of AP at 498 K enhanced from 38 to 87 % with rise in the copper content from 5 to 10 wt.% and then decreased to 47 % with a further increment in the Cu content to 20 wt.%. The relative decrease in the conversion can be attributed to the sintering of metal particles at high Cu loadings (15 and 20 wt.%). In contrast, the PhE selectivity of all the catalysts tends to drop linearly with the temperature from 473–573 K (Fig. 6b). This can be ascribed to the generation of more acidic sites at higher reaction temperatures that favors the formation of the EB by successive hydrogenolysis of PhE (Fig. S6, supplementary information). Therefore, based on the above results, it can be judicially confirmed that 10Cu/C-MgO is the suitable catalyst and 498 K represent the best temperature to achieve the utmost conversion of AP (∼87 %) and high selectivity of PhE (∼75 %). The enhanced activity of 10Cu/C-MgO catalyst compared to other catalysts is due to the presence of a greater number of surface-active copper sites as confirmed from the N2O chemisorption (Table 3). High selectivity of PhE in the hydrogenation of AP, however, remains a challenging task undoubtedly owing to the complex reaction network with several consecutive steps [7]. Typically, noble metals like Ru, Pd, and Pt supported materials can catalyze chemo-selective hydrogenation of AP, but required harsh reaction conditions, and toxic organic solvents [9,10]. The mentioned reaction conditions are unviable towards large-scale production of PhE due to severe operating cost and potential safety issues emerged in the reactor system. Conversely, non-noble Ni-based catalysts equally had a low selectivity towards PhE due to intrinsic activity of Ni for catalytic hydrogenation of the aromatic ring and hydrogenolysis which gives other byproducts like 1-cyclohexyl ethanol, ethylcyclohexane, and ethylbenzene respectively. Besides, very few supported Cu catalysts found to be extremely selective to PhE [8], in both liquid and vapor phase but required high reaction pressure and organic solvents are the primary disadvantages. Furthermore, independent acetophenone hydrogenation cannot give desirable yields of PhE and not an atom-efficient process. Fascinatingly, there are numerous reports for the gas-phase selective synthesis of GBL along with hydrogen production from 1,4-BDO [18,20]. In addition, 1,4-BDO is directly available from renewable resources, an attractive choice of reagents [5]. However, the most significant advantage of 1,4-BDO as a reducing agent goes on the fact that it can act irreversibly. 1,4-BDO is, therefore, an alternative to formic acid as a non-reversible reducing agent and may provide advantages with the catalyst systems that do not react via metal hydrides. In some recent reports, 1,4-BDO was employed as a H2 source (donor) for the hydrogenation of benzaldehyde to yield benzyl alcohol over Cu supported on CeO2-Al2O3 as an active catalyst [23,31]. Likewise, in this report, selective synthesis of PhE from AP has been achieved using 1,4-BDO as H2 donor over Cu/C-MgO as a potential catalyst and the specific details are in the forthcoming sections."
15,"Direct coupling of 1,4-BDO dehydrogenation and AP hydrogenation","In the direct catalytic coupling process, two or more value-added products can be synthesized simultaneously under similar reaction conditions without external H2 supply with maximum energy utilization, increased lifetime of the catalyst, hydrogen economy, and time-saving process. In contrast, pilot-scale industry reactions obviously needed viable reaction conditions in terms of low cost, time-saving methods and high yields of desired products, hence the coupling reaction process emerged as an alternative process towards the synthesis of a variety of fine chemicals. According to the previous explanations, the coupling reactions undoubtedly representsa superior advantage than independent reactions in terms of numerous experimental aspects. The gas-phase dehydrogenation-hydrogenation coupling of 1,4-BDO and AP (1:2 mol ratio) was carried out on Cu/C-MgO material under N2 atmosphere at ambient pressure (Scheme 3 )."
16,Influence of Cu loadings on catalytic performance,"6.1 Influence of Cu loadings on catalytic performance Blank run without active catalyst at 498 K offered no direct transformation of both the reactants 1,4-BDO and AP respectively. The effect of active Cu content on the reactivity for the direct catalytic coupling reaction is described in Fig. 7 a. The conversion of 1,4-BDO (X1,4-BDO) raised from 53 to 98 % with the addition of active Cu content from 5 wt% (5Cu/C-MgO) to 10 wt% (10Cu/C-MgO) and then decreased to 68 % with a further addition in the Cu content to 20 wt.% (20Cu/C-MgO). Consistently, the conversion of AP (XAP) represents a similar trend and attenuated from 51 to 91 % up to 10 wt% (10Cu/C-MgO) then decreased to 65 % for the 20Cu/C-MgO catalyst. It is noteworthy that the XAP is always lower than X1,4-BDO which characteristically hinge on the quantity of in-situ H2 released from the dehydrogenation of 1,4-BDO. In contrast, the selectivity of GBL (SGBL) and PhE (SPhE) are invariably equal to 99 % for all the Cu loadings. It clearly demonstrates the optimal amount of Cu performs an effective role on catalytic performance. Incomparably, the enhanced activity of 10Cu/C-MgO catalyst compared to other catalysts is due to the active occurrence of large amount of surface copper active sites as confirmed from the N2O chemisorption (Table 3). In addition, the improved activity can be plausibly attributed to the small particle size, significant dispersion, and strong metal-support interaction as observed from XRD, TEM, N2O chemisorption, and TPR respectively. Secondly, the presence of moderate basic sites, as evidenced from CO2-TPD analysis immensely contributes to the high selectivity of GBL (SGBL) and PhE (SPhE) respectively. The relative decrease in the conversion at high Cu content (15Cu/C-MgO and 20Cu/C-MgO) can be typically attributed to the sintering of metal particles. Further, the low specific surface area might provide limited space for the adsorption of reactants which results in a steep drop in the activity at higher Cu loadings. According to efficient activity, it is observed that 10 wt.% Cu is the best loading out of all catalysts in terms of improved activity together with selectivity."
17,Temperature effect on selectivity/activity,"6.2 Temperature effect on selectivity/activity The effect of temperature on the activity of 1,4-BDO and AP direct coupling reaction over the best catalyst (10Cu/C-MgO) is studied in the selected T range from 473–573 K and results obtained are depicted in Fig. 7b. With the increase in the T from 473 to 498 K, X1,4-BDO improved from 90 to 98 % and then leveled-off till 523 K followed by a marginal decrease in the X1,4-BDO to 94 % at 573 K. While the XAP attenuated from 84 to 93 % up to 498 K and tend to drop continuously with a further hike in the T and attain 61 % at 573 K. All products steady selectivity is achieved until temperature of 498 K and there is a significant change in their distribution with elevation in the T above 498 K. For example, the target educts i.e., SGBL & SPhE are virtually equal and held at ca. 99 % up to 498 K above which the selectivity came down significantly. For instance, the selectivity of by-products like tetrahydrofuran (THF) & ethylbenzene (EB) increased beyond 498 K (Fig. S7, supplementary information). In general, reaction at elevated temperature has tendency to form high coke deposition which obviously block the active Cu species. At such elevated reaction temperature, PhE usually undergoes hydrogenolysis to EB under the influence of coke deposition [43]. It is usually agreed that THF is certainly formed at the expense of GBL by dehydration on acidic nature of the catalyst at high reaction temperature [7]. In summary, 498 K represents the finest temperature to achieve good activity and selectivity."
18,Time on-stream performance of 10Cu/C-MgO catalyst,"6.3 Time on-stream performance of 10Cu/C-MgO catalyst The long-term stability of the 10Cu/C-MgO catalyst for the coupling reaction was properly studied with time on the best catalyst at 498 K for 30 h and graphically represented in Fig. 8 . It is noticeable from the figure that the X1,4-BDO and XAP were constant at 98 % and 95 %, respectively revealing that the catalyst activity was stable under the working reaction conditions. The prior results on individual AP hydrogenation represent XAP is around 87 % and SPhE is 75 % where the mole ratio of AP:H2 is kept as 1:1. Contrarily, in the coupled process, the mole ratio of 1,4-BDO: AP is maintained as 1:2 where the XAP and SPhE is invariably 95 % and 99 % respectively. The competitive adsorption of 1,4-BDO and AP facilitates the instant desorption of PhE from the catalyst surface during the coupled reaction. This clearly indicates that the in-situ generated H2 from 1,4-BDO is efficiently utilized for the successful conversion of AP into the desired product PhE in the simultaneous reaction. The proposed mechanism (Scheme 4 ) provides an understanding of the direct coupling reaction merely following the Langmuir Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism on the surface of solid Cu/C-MgO catalysts. Initially, dehydrogenation of 1,4-BDO takes place on the active Cu site by the abstraction of a proton from the hydroxyl groups over the surface basic nature to give alkoxide intermediate. Secondly, the transfer of hydride ion generates a highly unstable 4-hydroxy butanal (4-HB) and the simultaneous utilization of in-situ hydrogen by the adsorbed AP on the adjacent dual Cu sites produce PhE. The following step involves hemi acetylation of 4-hydroxybutanal (4-HB) to 2-hydroxy tetrahydrofuran (HTHF). Finally, transfer of among the intermediate oxide ion and the removal of a hydride ion from the CH group produces the GBL. The reduced Cu/C-MgO catalyst typically contains both Cu+ ions and metallic Cu (Cu0) in consistent with the XPS results. It is noteworthy that, Cu+ ions stabilize the methoxy and acyl groups while Cu0 site was favorable for the dissociation of H2 [7]. The electrostatic repulsion between the active Cu species and bulk phenyl group in AP facilitates desorption of PhE. However, the hydrogenolysis of PhE may take place before desorbing from the active Cu site to form ethylbenzene (EB) depending on the partial pressure of H2 [7]. While the electropositive Cu+ ions may act as Lewis acidic sites and facilitates the dehydration of 1,4-BDO to inevitably generate THF. The present catalytic system achieved unusual activity by means of conversion and selectivity during coupling reaction as illustrated in Fig. 8. As indicated in the literature, the catalytic dehydrogenation-hydrogenation coupling activity depends on the homogeneous alignment of metallic Cu particles and synergistic interactions between metal and the support. Furthermore, the exceptional thermal stability of Cu/C-MgO catalyst controls the aggregation of active Cu species during the long-term activity. In summary, the moderate basicity of C-MgO accurately regulate the acidic sites and facilitate the strong interaction with Cu particles illustrate the remarkable strategy for the better activity. In addition, the synthesis of biomorphic C-MgO supported Cu nanoparticles by exo-template method is a simple, fast, economical and eco-friendly one compared the other reported methods."
19,Conclusions,"In summary, this study has revealed the prospect of gas-phase direct catalytic coupling of biomass-derived 1,4-BDO and AP in a single step under identical reaction conditions. Biomorphic C-MgO derived from rice grains has a tendency to form nano size Cu species due to high surface area and unusual surface textural properties. However, the high basic nature of C-MgO is facilitating the selective formation of γ-butyrolactone along with hydrogen as a byproduct. In-situ liberated H2 can be effectively utilized in the hydrogenation of acetophenone. This H2 is proved to be more active/selective than externally supplied H2. Further, the amount of Cu content also has a robust influence on the catalytic activity. Based on the above findings, reaction conditions are optimized and the efficient catalyst loading was identified. Among the tested catalysts, 10 wt% Cu/C-MgO exhibited the best performance with an unprecedented yield of γ-butyrolactone (≥97 %) and 1-phenylethanol (94 %) could be successfully achieved. Moreover, the reported catalysts exhibit prolonged catalytic activity up to 30 h and can be easily separated after the reaction."
