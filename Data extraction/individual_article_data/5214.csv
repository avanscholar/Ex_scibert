0,Introduction,"Alcoholism is a global social and health problem. Functioning of almost all organ systems is compromised by chronic alcohol intake (Altura and Altura, 1999; Thurman et al., 1999; Kershaw and Guidot, 2008; Djukić et al., 1999a). Recent reports confirmed that prolonged alcohol consummation in man is associated with infertility, decreased testosterone level and increased oxidative stress (OS) (Emanuele and Emanuele, 2001; Uygur et al., 2014). Metabolism (i.e. elimination) of excessively consumed ethanol follows zero-order kinetics, as capacity of catabolizing enzymes, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) in the liver is overloaded (Lieber, 1994). In such circumstances (when blood alcohol concentration exceeds 20 mM), ethanol oxidation proceeds additionally by hepatic microsomal mono-oxygenases, particularly cytochrome P450 2E1 isoenzyme, which rate of the reaction is ten times higher than those with ADH (Cederbaum, 2010a). Leaking of reducing equivalents (protons, H+ and electrons, e−) adheres to such types of redox reaction and contributes to OS development (Rukkumani et al., 2004). Generated reactive oxygen and/or nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) cause peroxidation of unsaturated lipids and oxidation/nitration of proteins and DNA. Disturbance of overall antioxidative defense capacity implies changed antioxidative enzyme activities, depletion of glutathione (GSH) and nicotine amide dinucleotide phosphate (NAD(P)H, accompanied with energy devastation, results in OS and cell death by apoptosis, eventually (Kershaw and Guidot, 2008; Cederbaum, 2010a). Disulfiram (tetraethylthiuram disulfide, bis[diethylthiocarbamyl] disulfide) (DSF) has been used in aversive therapy of alcoholism for almost 60 years. It inhibits enzyme ALDH (both isoforms, ALDH1A1 and ALDH2) (Moreb et al., 2012). Increased acetaldehyde blood concentration initiates unpleasant symptoms, so-called DSF-ethanol reaction (DER): flushing, palpitation, dyspnea, hypertension, increased pulse rate nausea, vomiting, cyanosis and decreased blood pressure (Djukić et al., 1999a, 1999b; Marcato et al., 2011). Since messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) for ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2 and ALDH1A3 is detected in human testes, DSF may induce inhibitory effect on testicular ALDH1 isoenzymes (Nishimtura and Naito, 2006; Zhai et al., 2001). The DSF metabolism comprises several pathways, including instant reduction into two molecules of diethyldithiocarbamates (DDTCs) that bind copper (Cu); undergoe methylation and conjugation with glucuronic acid; become oxidized into sulphate; and decomposed to carbon disulphide and diethylamine (Deitrich and Erwin, 1971; Lipsky et al., 2001). Dithiocarbamates are potent metal-chelating agents, used in the therapy of nickel and Cu poisonings (Sunderman, 1964). Additionally, many studies have reported on Cu-DDTC anticancer effect (Barth and Malcolm, 2010; Guo et al., 2010). Essential bioelements, such as zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), Cu, magnesium (Mg) and selenium (Se) play an important role in physiological, metabolic and oxidative cell signaling pathways in mammals (Rotter et al., 2015). Many studies have shown that various toxicants can cause OS in the testes with detrimental consequences to male fertility (Turner and Lysiak, 2008). In particular, alcohol metabolism contributes to the production of ROS, while DSF demonstrates both, antioxidant and pro-oxidant effect (Cederbaum, 2010b; Das and Vasudevan, 2005; Cunningham and Bailey, 2001; Wadhwa and Mumper, 2013). Since bioelements status interlopes with red-ox homeostasis, herein, we investigated if and if positive, in which extent alcohol and/or DSF per se affect bioelements' and red-ox status in testes of the subacutely exposed rats during individual and/or combined exposures (the later one assumes cessation of further alcohol intake, since DSF is introduced). In this line we measured content of bioelements (Zn, Cu, Fe, Mg and Se) and OS parameters [superoxide anion radical (O2 •–), GSH and oxidized glutathione (GSSG), lipid peroxidation (LPO) by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) decomposition and activities of total superoxide dismutase (tSOD), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR)] in testes of the exposed rats."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Animals,"2.1 Animals Adult male Wistar rats (weights of 220–250 g), kept in cages under standardized housing conditions (ambient temperature: 23 ± 2 °C, relative humidity: 55± 3% and a light/dark cycle: 13/11 h), had free access to standard laboratory pellet food and tap water. The rats were adapted to laboratory conditions for two-weeks. Lately, the applied procedures, were performed between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. The experimental animals were treated accordingly to Guidelines for Animal Study, No. 12032014/9 (Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection – Veterinary Directorate)."
3,Experimental design,"2.2 Experimental design The animals were randomly divided into five major groups, subdivided into minor groups (n = 6), according to the duration of applied treatment: control (C) groups – not treated rats, C21 and C42, rats that had free access only to food and water for 21 and 42 days, respectively; olive oil (OL) groups – OL21 and OL22-42 , rats that received 0.5 mL of olive oil (solvent for DSF) from 21-42 days; alcohol (A) groups – A1, A3, A10 and A21; DSF groups – DSF1, DSF3, DSF10 and DSF21; and A+DSF groups – A21+DSF22, A21+DSF22-24, A21+DSF22-31 and A21+DSF22-42 – rats previously treated with alcohol for 21 days and lately with DSF only, from 22 to 42 days. The animals received daily 3 mL 20% ethanol/kg and/or 0.5 mL of suspended 178.5 mg DSF/kg in olive oil, by gastric intubation. After the treatment, the animals were anesthetized with a 50 mg of sodium pentobarbital/kg injection, followed by decapitation. The testes were removed immediately and stored at -80 °C, until analyzing. The concentrations of Zn, Fe, Cu, Mg and Se and OS parameters (O2 •–, total SOD, decomposition of H2O2, MDA, GSH and GSSG and activities of GST and GR) were measured in testes homogenates."
4,Reagents,"2.3 Reagents All reagents and chemicals were of analytical grade. We used ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid – EDTA, nitrobluetetrazolium - NBT, nitric acid - HNO3 (65%) from Fisher Chemical, UK; perchloric acid - HClO4 (65%), hydrochloric acid - HCl, sodium hydroxide-NaOH, metaphosphoric acid - MPA, sodium perchlorate, ortho-phosphoric acid, diethyl ether, 2-methyl butane, kits for Glutathione-S-transferase and Gluthatione reductase determination from Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, USA; sodium phosphate -Na2HPO4, potassium dihydrogen phosphate - KH2PO4, glycerol, paraformaldehyde, trichloroacetic acid - TCA, thiobarbituric acid - TBA, cadmium chloride (CdCl2·H2O), metals standard solutions (Cd, Cu, Zn, Mg, Fe) and malondialdehyde bis(dimethylacetal) - MDA from Merck, Germany; sodium pentobarbital Vetanarcol (0.162 g/mL) from Werfft - Chemie, Vienna, Austria; saline solution (0.9% w/v) and deionized water from Hospital Pharmacy Military Medical Academy, Belgrade, Serbia; and Ransod commercial kits for Superoxide dismutase determination from RANDOX Laboratories, UK."
5,Analysis of metals,"2.4 Analysis of metals Testes samples (around 1 g) were mineralized with a mixture of the concentrated acids, HNO3 and HClO4 (4:1, v/v). Mineralized dried samples were diluted to 10 mL with 0.1 M HNO3. The concentrations of Cu, Zn, Fe, Mg and Se were analyzed with atomic absorption spectrometer (Analyst 200, PerkinElmer) equipped with air-acetylene flame. Relevant metal standard solutions were prepared according to the PerkinElmer Pure Atomic Spectroscopy Standards guidelines (NIST traceable CRM, AccuStandard). The absorption wavelengths were 216.51 nm, 213.86 nm, 305.91 nm, 285.21 nm and 196.05 nm for Cu, Zn, Fe, Mg and Se measurements, respectively. Metal contents in the testicular tissue are expressed as μg/g wet tissue (Cu, Zn, Fe and Mg) and ng/g wet tissue (Se)."
6,Tissue homogenates for biochemical analysis of redox status,"2.5 Tissue homogenates for biochemical analysis of redox status The whole procedure of tissue preparing was performed on ice. Around 100 mg of the testes tissue was transferred into 1 ml ice-cold buffered sucrose (0.25 mol/L sucrose, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA in sodium– potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) and homogenized twice with a Teflon pestle, at 800 rpm for 15 min, at 4 °C (Tehnica Zelezniki Manufacturing, Slovenia). The homogenates were centrifuged at 2500 rpm, for 30 min, at 4 °C. Supernatants were sonicated by three cycles (30s sonication and 15s pause) and used for analysis of OS markers and protein measurements. The samples were stored at -80 °C until analysis."
7,Tissue homogenates for glutathione determination,"2.6 Tissue homogenates for glutathione determination The whole procedure of tissue preparing was performed on ice. Around 100 mg of the testes tissue was transferred into 1 ml ice-cold saline solution followed by addition of 1 ml ice-cold MPA (5% w/v) for deproteinization. Homogenization was performed twice with a Teflon pestle, at 800 rpm for 15 min, at 4 °C (Tehnika Zelezniki Manufacturing, Slovenia). The homogenates were immediately centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 25 min, at 4 °C and supernatants were proceeded for chromatographic analysis."
8,Measurements of redox status,"2.7 Measurements of redox status 2.7.1 Superoxide anion radical assay Quantification of O2 •– was based on nitrobluetetrazolium (NBT) reduction to yellow colored monoformazan by O2 •– with absorbance measurable at 550 nm (Auclair and Voisin, 1985). The results are expressed as nmol of reduced NBT/mg proteins. 2.7.2 Superoxide dismutase assay Activity of tSOD was determined by Ransod commercial kits, based on the indirect spectrophotometric measurement of red colored complex (formazan dye), produced by 2-(4-iodophenyl)3-(4-nitrophenol)-5-phenyltetrazolium and O2 •– (substrate for tSOD). The formation of colored complex (measured at 505 nm) decreases with tSOD activity increasing, due to O2 •– depletion. The results are expressed as units of tSOD/mg proteins. 2.7.3 Decomposition of H2O2 assay Kinetics of H2O2 decomposition was assayed according to the procedure of Yi L. and Herb E.S. (2007) (Yi and Herb, 2007). The rate of H2O2 decomposition is proportional to the absorbance (at 240 nm) decrease. Results are expressed as μmol of H2O2/min/mg proteins. 2.7.4 Glutathione-S-transferase assay Activity of GST was assayed spectrophotometrically by Habig et al. method (1974). The underlying principle of the method is the conjugation of GSH to 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), catalyzed by GST. The absorption maximum of formed GS-DNB conjugate occurs at 340 nm. The results are expressed as units of GST/mg proteins (Pabst et al., 1974). 2.7.5 Glutathione reductase assay Activity of GR was assayed indirectly. Glutathione reductase catalyzes the reduction of GSSG into GSH. Further on, GSH reacts with 5, 5-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid forming chromophore (at 412 nm) 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB) and GS-TNB. The absorbance increase corresponds to GR activity (i.e. to GSH). The results are expressed as units of GR/mg proteins (Worthington and Rosemeyer, 1976). 2.7.6 Malondialdehyde assay Malondialdehyde was measured spectrophotometrically by the method of Ohkawa et al. (1979). Briefly, TBA reacts with MDA (in ratio 2:1) generating a fluorescent red complex (532 nm). The results are expressed as nmol MDA/mg proteins. 2.7.7 HPLC-UV determination of reduced and oxidized glutathione Simultaneous measurement of GSH and GSSG was performed with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV) method by Begic et al. (2017). An isocratic chromatographic separation was carried out on ZORBAX Eclipse AAA (4.6 × 150 mm, 3.5 μm) analytical column (Agilent Technologies), at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, at 40 °C and UV detection, at 215 nm. Mobile phase consisted of 100 mM sodium perchlorate solution (pH 2.8 adjusted with 0.1% ortho-phosphoric acid) (Begic et al., 2017). The results were expressed as nmol GSH or GSSG/mg proteins and as the ratio GSSG/GSH."
9,Protein determination,"2.8 Protein determination The Lowry method was used for protein measurement in tissue homogenates (Lowry et al., 1951)."
10,Statistical analysis,"2.9 Statistical analysis One-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc multiple test was used (software GraphPad Prism, version 5.01) for statistical data analysis. Values are presented as the means ± standard deviation. Correlation analysis were performed by Spearman's test. Differences were considered statistically significant for p < 0.05."
11,Results,
12,The metal status,"3.1 The metal status Alcohol intake resulted in decrease of Zn by 21% and 23% after 10 and 21 days, respectively and increase of Fe by 31% after 21 days, whilst Cu and Mg levels in testes were not changed (Fig. 1 ). In DSF groups, Zn decreased by 17% during 1–10th day and Cu by around 28% (1–21st day), while Fe increased by 47% at 21st day. No changes in Mg content were observed (Fig. 1). In the A21+DSF groups, Zn decreased by 17%, 14%, 16% and 19% after DSF administration (at 22, 24, 31 and 42 day of overall treatment), respectively, while Cu increased by 73% and 42% after 3 and 10 days of introduced DSF, respectively; Fe increased by 59% at 21 day of DSF ingestion (i.e. 42nd day of the treatment); and no changes in Mg content were observed (Fig. 1). Selenium concentrations were hardly detectable (in only 13% of the samples Se was measurable) and the obtained results did not show significant differences across the experimental groups (Fig. 1). According to our results status of examined metals in OL groups did not show statistically significant differences compared to the C groups (Figs. 1–3 )."
13,The redox status,"3.2 The redox status Alcohol caused: i) an increase in testicular O2 •– by 167% and 194% on 10th and 21st day of the treatment, respectively; ii) gradual reduction of tSOD and GST activities on the 3rd, 10th and 21st day by 29%, 48% and 53%, and by 37%, 42% and 66%, respectively; iii) decrease in H2O2 decomposition by 25%was observed at 21st day; iv) an increase in testicular MDA by 16%, 34%, 40% and 49% after 1, 3, 10 and 21 days of exposure; v) GSH decrease by 35%, at 10th day; vi) no changes were in GSSG levels (Figs. 2 and 3). Administration of DSF, alone, provoked: i) an increase in O2 •– by 263%, 262%, 278% and 415% on the 1st, 3rd, 10th and 21st day, respectively; ii) a reduction in tSOD and GST activities by18%, 57%, 61% and 68% and by 41%, 39%, 48% and 67% after 1, 3, 10 and 21 days, respectively; iii) a decrease of GR activity at 1st day for 28%; iv) no changes in the enzymes’ activities that decompose H2O2; v) MDA levels decrease from 3-21st day by around 26%; vi) a decrease of GSH at 10th day for 43%; and vii) no effect on GSSG level (Figs. 2 and 3). Introduction of DSF from 22-42nd day in the group of rats previously treated with alcohol (for 21 days) resulted in following changes, compared to the A21 group: i) a gradual decrease of O2 •– for 35%, though yet significantly over the C groups and MDA closed to C group; ii) a reduction in tSOD at 21st day for 33%; iii) no changes in rate of H2O2 decomposition and activity of GST; iv) an increase of GR activity for 54% at 10th day; v) an increase of GSH at 10th and 21st day for around 28%; and vi) no effect on GSSG level (Figs. 2 and 3)."
14,Discussion,"We showed that subacute exposure of male rats to alcohol and DSF affects status of bioelements and redox status in testicular tissue. Disrupted bioelements’ status can impair structure and functioning of metalloproteins/metalloenzymes, including antioxidative defense, cell signalization and cell survival (Djordjevic et al., 2008). Transition metals participate in the production of FRs through Fenton-like reaction, thus contributing OS development (Djuric et al., 2015). The applied DSF dose (178 mg/kg) was calculated according to the lowest therapeutical dose for aversive treatment of alcoholics (125 mg/70 kg = 1.78 mg/kg) which was multiplied by a factor of insecurity 100 (10 for differences between species and 10 for differences within species). Even higher doses of DSF orally administered to rats did not provoke any adverse effects (Koivusalo, 1959; Badawy and Bano, 2016; Nabekura et al., 2003). In regard to DSF liposolubility, olive oil was used as the vehicle. No significant differences between OL- and C- groups were achieved for the measured parameters. The chosen duration of treatments is adequate for the evaluation of the obtained toxic effects (Thorne, 2001). Our results confirmed that subacute alcohol intake does not affect testicular Cu. According to the literature, it may be linked to the decreased activity of ceruloplasmin (Cu-transporter protein, 95% Cu is bind to this protein) in patients with alcoholic liver steatosis, in spite of normal levels of apoceruloplasmin (Uhlikova et al., 2008). On the other side, DSF applied individually and after subacute alcohol intake decreased instantly and significantly content of testicular Cu (Fig. 1). The obtained discrepancy may be explained by the formation of DDTC-Cu(I) (the principal DSF metabolic pathway that occurs in liver) and changed kinetics of DDTC-Cu(I) elimination from the testes (Blackburn et al., 2014; Han et al., 2013). However, subacute alcohol ingestion itself provoked changes in rat testes (based on the results of redox status and elevated Fe that probably resulted in some physiological dysfunctionalities, including transported mechanism for the DDTC-Cu(I) elimination (Djukić et al., 1999a). The ability of DSF to bind Cu is recognized as the key mechanism of enzyme inhibition, including SOD, dopamine-β-hydroxylase, carboxylesterase and cholinesterase, as well as antitumor characteristic of since DDTC-Cu complex induces OS in tumor cells, unlike copper alone (Uhlikova et al., 2008; Dalecki et al., 2015). According to the literature, reduced Zn concentrations were obtained in testes in A, DSF and A+ DSF groups (Fig. 1) (Morawska et al., 2003; Sun et al., 2016; Hee et al., 1988). The maintenance of testicular Zn homeostasis is of great importance for the proper functioning of reproductive system. Zinc deficiency impairs angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, which in turn leads to testosterone depletion and spermatogenesis inhibition. Defects in spermatozoa are frequently observed in the Zn-deficient rats (Bedwal and Bahuguna, 1994). Since Zn reacts easily with –SH groups of amino acids and proteins, its decline may correspond to GSH depletion, which we determined to be by 10%, compared to controls (Fig. 3) (Trachootham et al., 2010; Bonda et al., 2004). Disulfiram, like other thiols of low molecular weight (d-penicillamine, N-acetil cistein, captopril, tetrathiomolybdate etc.), demonstrates antioxidant and pro-oxidant effect (Wadhwa and Mumper, 2013), which is in line with our results. Pro-oxidant activity of DSF were recognized in O2 •– increase and tSOD and GST activities decrease (Fig. 2), hence it act as Cu ionophore. Contrary, free –SH group in DDTC preserves GSH reserves (Fig. 3) and is responsible for DFS antioxidant effect (Trachootham et al., 2010; Bonda et al., 2004). Postponed increase of testicular Fe was accomplished in all three major experimental groups (A10-21, DSF1-21 and A21+DSF22-42) (Fig. 1), which is in accordance to in vitro study of Perez-Gallardo et al. on S. cerevisiae ISC mutants (2013) that reported on ROS overproduction (during fermentation process) associated with Fe release from Fe–S-containing enzymes, at cellular and mitochondrial levels (Pérez-Gallardo et al., 2013). Considering Fe pro-oxidative effect, elevated O2 •–, by around 194% was anticipated (Fig. 2). Overproduction of ROS refers to Fenton reaction, in which Fe2+ reacts with H2O2. Dismutation of O2 •–, catalyzed by tSOD, leads to the production of H2O2, which may homolytically cleaves into two harmful hydroxyl radicals (HO•). Increased testicular Fe content (Fig. 1) can be associated with its binding to –SH groups of DDTC. Higher levels of O2 •–, in DSF group, may be attributed to lower reducing potential of Fe-complexes [Fe(DTTC) 2, i.e. Fe(SH)2], compared to free Fe (Buettner and Jurkiewicz, 1996; Buettner, 1993). Increased testicular Fe may be responsible for deleterious effect of ROS on testicular tissue and impaired reproductive male function in alcoholics, as well alcoholics treated with DSF (Dosumu et al., 2012). Contrary to this, lower O2 •– in A21+DSF22-42 groups can be atributed to partly deteriorated organ functions upon subacute alcohol exposure (Djukić et al., 1999a, 1999b). Applied DSF treatment after cessation of alcohol intake resulted in decreased O2 •– and MDA levels; not reactivated tSOD and enzymes that decompose H2O2 into water (H2O) and oxygen (O2) [catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)] (Fig. 2). Decreased concentrations of Zn and Cu (Fig. 1) caused by the exposure to alcohol and DSF are in a relation with significantly reduced tSOD activity in this group (A+DSF), as they are active sites of this enzyme (Fig. 2). Also, delayed increase of Fe in the A+DSF groups corresponded to significantly reduced activities of tSOD and enzymes that decompose H2O2 (Figs. 1 and 2), as Fe supports ROS production through Fenton reaction and contributes OS development. High Fe concentrations affect sperm count, motility and morphology (Marzec-Wróblewska et al., 2012). Recent evidence has implicated that GSH-bound Fe corresponds to cytosolic Fe pool. However, (Fe-S) clusters (inorganic prosthetic groups) may be bound to GSH from cysteine residue of glutaredoxin, which is an important oxidoreductase found in all forms of living organisms (involved in reduction of glutathionylated proteins, regulation of Fe homeostasis, repairing of Fe–S clusters and is important in response to an oxidative signal in cells) (Hider and Kong, 2013). Embedded in mitochondria membrane, Fe–S proteins regulate respiratory electron transport and are essential for the enzymes activity (Schilke et al., 1999). No changes in Mg homeostasis in testes of rats under the applied treatments justify robust capacity of Mg homeostasis maintenance (Fig. 1). Based on our results we cannot reach a conclusion about the effect of alcohol and/or DSF on Se in testes, due to analytical limitation (we detected Se in only 13% of the samples) (Fig. 1). As a cofactor of antioxidant enzyme GPx, Se plays a significant role in proper reproductive system functioning. Positive correlation between Se intake and fertility was acclaimed, i.e. its deficiency alters procreation processes (Pieczyńska and Grajeta, 2015). Our results are in line with many previous studies focusing on the molecular mechanisms of alcohol toxicity and impaired red-ox homeostasis (Howida, 2014; Oremosu and Akang, 2015). We showed that subacute administration of alcohol has a strong ability to induce OS in rat testes. Elevated levels of O2 •– (Fig. 2), increased LPO (Fig. 2) and depletion of GSH (deceased GSSG/GSH ratio) (Fig. 3) have proven that development of OS in rat testes upon alcohol consummation is an important mechanism of reproductive toxicity. Sulfhydryl group can be oxidized in the presence of transition metal ions (such as Cu, Fe), which further provide thiyl radical chain type of FRs reactions, dependent on pH, their concentration and metal-binding capability (Winterbourn and Hampton, 2008). It has also been confirmed that -SH may be directly involved in Fenton-like reaction instead of hydrogen peroxide, which implies possible further generation of thiyl type of radicals (Wadhwa and Mumper, 2013; Munday, 1989). These findings are in line with studies on alcohol induced testicular toxicity associated ROS overproduction and LPO (Dosumu et al., 2012). Also, observed decrease in SOD and GST activity and rate of H2O2 decomposition (Figs. 2 and 3) caused by alcohol intoxication is in accordance with the literature (Howida, 2014). Disulfiram has shown beneficial effect on only few measured OS parameters (O2 •– and MDA) that were previously affected by subacute exposure to alcohol. By imitating GSH/GSSG red-ox and metal binding activities, DSF/DDTC red-ox couple can lead to improvement of impaired red-ox homeostasis in rat testes previously induced by exposure to alcohol. Both, DSF and GSH are –SH containing compounds with strong reducing properties, hence they can share their influence on red-ox balance (Buettner and Jurkiewicz, 1996; Buettner, 1993). Further on, high metal-binding affinity of DSF/DDTC modifies red-ox homeostasis, directly and/or throughout changes of corresponding metalloproteins/metalloenzymes functions."
