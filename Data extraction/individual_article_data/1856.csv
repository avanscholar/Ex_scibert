0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is an alternative clean energy carrier for the future. Biological process is a promising way for hydrogen production from renewable biomass. Biohydrogen can be produced by obligate anaerobes, facultative anaerobes and photosynthetic bacteria [1,2]. However, biohydrogen production in industrial scale is still difficult to be accomplished due to the high production cost. Therefore, development of the microbes with high production rate and hydrogen yield is needed to construct the efficient biohydrogen production systems. Since the fermentative hydrogen production from biomass needs to be performed using mixed culture in open air, modification of bacterial strains by feasible non-GMO (genetically modified organisms) mutation breeding methods is always indispensable for the improvement of the hydrogen productivity. Microbial mutation breeding methods have been widely used in the fermentation industry, including physical mutation methods such as ultraviolet radiation and ion beam [3], and chemical mutagenesis methods such as sodium azide, diethyl sulphate and ethyl methanesulphonate [4]. In these conventional mutation methods, the safety for the health of the operators and the mutation efficiency issues are always the major concerns. As a physical mutation method, ion beam implantation which is based on the low-pressure plasmas generated at vacuum conditions has been developed for organisms’ mutation [5]. While in recent years, the so called glow discharge plasma sources generated at atmospheric pressure and low gas temperature have attracted increasing attentions due to their unique features and potential applications in many fields, such as biological and chemical decontamination of warfare agents, and sterilization of heat-sensitive medical instruments [6]. Compared with the conventional low-pressure ion beam implantation operated at vacuum conditions, due to the removal of the complicated and expensive vacuum systems, the atmospheric pressure and low gas temperature plasma technology can generate the inert gas-based plasma jets within a very small region and can be operated easily with high safety and different doses. Among the novel plasma generating systems mentioned above, an atmospheric and room temperature plasma (abbreviated as ARTP) driven by a radio-frequency (RF) power supply with water-cooled, bare-metallic electrodes have the advantages of lower capital costs, low plasma temperature and flexible operations, and thus show promising applications in biotechnology [7–9]. Up to now, most papers focused on the fundamental physical research and their applications in medical fields, for example, the plasma sterilization of contaminated materials and decontamination of chemical and/or biological warfare agents. Recently, our studies showed that the ARTP generated by a radio-frequency (RF) power supply and using helium was around 25–40°C, and showed a diverse breakage of plasmid DNA and oligonucleotides with the variation of the plasma dosage [7,10]. The ARTP also made the bacterial gene damage pattern significantly different from UV and chemical mutagenesis as analyzed by umu test [10]. These results suggested that ARTP can be used as a rapid mutation tool for microbial breeding. The ARTP mutation method has been successfully applied for the mutation of Streptomyces avermitilis, enabling to generate a mutant with higher productivity of avermectin [11]. A similar atmospheric-pressure plasma was also reported to affect the heterotrophic pathway of Escherichia coli as well as its morphology [12]. Additionally, because the ARTP equipment can be made compact and the operation is easily performed at the mild conditions, it can be expected to be a promising tool for use in biotechnology. Enterobacter aerogenes, a facultative anaerobe, shows a relatively high hydrogen production rate [13], and has two routes to produce hydrogen: formate pathway and NADH pathway [14–16]. Also, by its aerobic growth and the exhaustion of residual oxygen in the culturing system, the facultative anaerobe can help to automatically create a strictly anaerobic environment for hydrogen production by a microbial consortium containing the anaerobes [17]. Therefore, E. aerogenes is a potential bacterial strain for biohydrogen production. Mahyudin et al. obtained a mutant of E. aerogenes mutant AY-2 by double mutation using allyl alcohol and proton suicide methods, which could produce 1.17mol of hydrogen production per mole glucose consumed, while the wide-type E. aerogenes HU-101 could only produce 0.56mol of hydrogen production per mole glucose consumed [18]. Even though many studies have been carried out to enhance hydrogen production mainly by optimizing the cultivation conditions of E. aerogenes, the hydrogen yield is still lower than the theoretical value of 2molH2/mol-glucose. In this paper, we studied the mutation of E. aerogenes using the ARTP generated with helium gas, and examined the cell growth, glucose consumption, hydrogen production and metabolic flux distribution of a typical E. aerogenes mutant. Furthermore, the genetic stability of the mutant for hydrogen production was also examined."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microbe and medium,"2.1 Microbe and medium E. aerogenes IAM1183, purchased from the Institute of Applied Microorganisms of the University of Tokyo, Japan, was cultivated at 37°C, 170rpm. The culture medium (1l) consisted of glucose 15.0g, tryptone 5.0g, (NH4)2SO4 2.0g, KH2PO4 14.0g,K2HPO4·3H2O 6g and MgSO4·7H2O 0.2g [19,20]. All chemicals used were of analytical grade."
3,Protocols for helium-based ARTP mutation of E. aerogenes,"2.2 Protocols for helium-based ARTP mutation of E. aerogenes Fig. 1 shows the experimental protocols for the mutation by the helium-based ARTP. The ARTP system consisted of a coaxial-type plasma generator and a slider which can be moved up and down. The atmospheric-pressure helium plasma jet issued from the coaxial-type plasma generator mainly consists of different chemically active species [7], which can be irradiated upon the stainless steel plate located at the downstream of the plasma torch nozzle exit for microbial mutation. The distance between the plasma torch nozzle exit and the treated sample (or the slider) could be adjusted by moving the slider up and down. The detailed descriptions of the experimental setup can be found in our previous paper [7]. For mutation of E. aerogenes, 50μl of the culture (OD600 =2.0) was dipped onto a sterilized stainless steel plate (8.0mm in diameter) and dried in sterile air for a few minutes. The metal plate with the bacterial cells was then treated by the helium plasma jet. In order to obtain a uniform and low-temperature glow discharge plasma jet which is suitable for the treatment or mutation of the bacterial samples, the apparatus was operated at the helium gas flow rate of Q He =15.0slpm (standard liters per minute) and RF power input of 100W. Under these operating conditions, the plasma temperature on the surface of the metal plate was 25–40°C. Unless otherwise stated, the time for the treatment of E. aerogenes by ARTP was 3min. After treatment of the bacterial samples, the metal plate was washed with 2ml of sterilized saline solution. Then, 200μl of the elute was spread on a solid agar plate. After cultivation at 37°C overnight, colonies were selected, and then inoculated into a 70ml closed serum bottle with 30ml of the medium. The serum bottle was air-sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and degassed with 100% of aseptic nitrogen for 5min prior to inoculation. The cultivation was performed for 18h at 37°C and 170rpm. Based on the hydrogen productivity of the mutants, we selected the best bacterial strain for metabolic flux analysis and confirmation of the genetic stability."
4,Subcultures of mutant strains,"2.3 Subcultures of mutant strains The stability of the mutants was evaluated by the serial subcultivation. After the target mutant was incubated on the solid medium, a colony was transferred into a 70ml closed serum bottle with 30ml of the fresh liquid medium and cultivated for 18h (the first subculture). The culture obtained in the serum bottle was then seeded as the inoculum into a 70ml closed serum bottle with 30ml of the fresh liquid medium once again, and cultivated for 18h (the second subculture). The above culture was repeated for 25 subcultures. The hydrogen production was checked in the 70ml closed serum bottle in every subculture."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The optical density of the cells at 600nm (OD600) was measured by using an ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer (UV757CRT, Shanghai Precision & Scientific Instrument Co. Ltd.). Based on the standard curve of dry cell weight (DCW) vs OD600, the cell concentration in terms of DCW was calculated. The pH value of the culture was measured by a pH meter (Model 828, ORION). Gas composition was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC112A, Shanghai Precision & Scientific Instrument Co. Ltd.) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 2m×3mm (inner diameter) stainless steel column packed with TDX-01 (80–100 mesh). The temperatures of the injector, detector, and column were kept at 120°C, 120°C, and 80°C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 10ml/min [21]. The concentrations of the anaerobic metabolites including organic acids and alcohols were analyzed in a high-performance liquid chromatograph (Shimadzu 10A), equipped with a refractive index detector (RID) and a Shimadzu SCR-102H column after pretreatment with a 0.45-μm-thick membrane filter. 5mM of HClO4 was used as a mobile phase at a flow rate of 1ml/min [21]. The concentration of reducing sugars was measured by 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) colorimetry [22]."
6,Evaluation of mutagenesis of E. aerogenes by ARTP,"2.5 Evaluation of mutagenesis of E. aerogenes by ARTP The lethality rate of the bacterial strain was evaluated based on the following equation: Lethality rate ( % ) = U − T U × 100 where U is the total colony count of the sample without treatment, and T is the total colony count after treatment by the plasma. All the colony numbers were obtained by the CFU (Colony-Forming Units) method on the solid medium. The mutation rate and the positive mutation rate were calculated using the following equations: Mutation rate ( R M ) ( % ) = M T × 100 Positive mutation rate ( R P ) ( % ) = P M × 100 where M is the total CFU of the mutant strains with either changed hydrogen productivity or growth compared with the wild strain, and P is the CFU of the mutants with improved hydrogen productivity than that of the wild strain."
7,Metabolic flux analysis,"2.6 Metabolic flux analysis Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) was based on the assumption of a pseudo-steady state for all intracellular concentrations of the metabolites and molar balances for all anaerobic metabolites involved in E. aerogenes [15,23,24]. In our research, the major products are acetate, lactate, ethanol, hydrogen and carbon dioxide in addition to small amounts of succinate and 2,3-butanediol. We did the metabolic flux analysis, based on the metabolic map of E. aerogenes, which had been reported [15,20]. For the stoichiometric model, we made assumptions as follows: (1) Under anaerobic conditions for hydrogen production, tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation can be neglected. (2) Molecular formula of E. aerogenes cell was C4.2H8O1.25N0.68P0.1, and the production of CO2 in the synthesis process of biomass is neglected. Synthesis of biomass only utilizes glucose-6-P as the substrate, and N and P are ignored [25]. (3) Hydrogen is formed not only from the formate pathway, but also the NADH pathway [16]. According to the analysis of metabolite production, the flux distributions were estimated for the anaerobic metabolism of the original E. aerogenes and its mutant strain."
8,Results,
9,Mutation and selection of mutants with improved hydrogen productivity,"3.1 Mutation and selection of mutants with improved hydrogen productivity After treatment of cells by the helium-based ARTP for 3min, the lethality rate of E. aerogenes reached 98.9%. This lethality rate was a key factor for obtaining more mutants with changed physiology. Since 50μl of the culture (OD600 =2.0) (1×107 cells) was used for the plasma treatment, at the cell lethality rate of 98.9%, about 1×105 cells still survived for mutant screening. Further analysis in terms of hydrogen productivity and cell growth showed that all the survived colonies were mutants. Of the mutants, the positive mutation rate which showed the improved hydrogen productivity was estimated to be about 10%. Then, a mutant showing the highest hydrogen productivity was chosen to study its culture performance and alteration of metabolism pertaining to hydrogen production, and compared with the original wild strain (Table 1 ). Measurements were performed after 18h cultivation when the E. aerogenes cells just entered into the stationary phase in the present culture. As seen from Table 1, the mutant showed an obvious enhancement of the hydrogen production and a slight increase in cell concentration. Compared with the wild strain, the hydrogen production per liter of the medium and per gram dry cell weight (DCW) by the selected mutant were increased by 14.5% and 12.2%, respectively. However, the mutant strain consumed less glucose than the wild strain did. After 18h cultivation for the wild strain and the mutant, lactate, ethanol and acetate were confirmed to be the main metabolites. The mutant produced less lactate, ethanol and acetate in per liter of medium than the wild strain."
10,Metabolic flux analysis for the mutant,"3.2 Metabolic flux analysis for the mutant According to the measurements of the biomass and metabolites, the results of MFA for the wild E. aerogenes and its mutant strain were obtained (Fig. 2 ). The carbon recovery rates were close to 100% (Table 2 ). The MFA results indicated that the mutant showed an increase in the hydrogen production flux from the formate and NADH pathways, compared with the wild strain. The mutant also exhibited higher lactate, ethanol, acetate, and succinate fluxes than those of the wild strain, while the flux of 2,3-butanediol formed in the mutant decreased. The total hydrogen flux of the mutant was higher than that of the wild strain. As shown in Table 2, the hydrogen yield of the wild E. aerogenes was 0.897molH2/mol-glucose, and that of the mutant generated by ARTP was 1.134molH2/mol-glucose. The total hydrogen yield of the mutant was increased by 26.4% compared to that of the wild strain. The hydrogen flux by NADH pathway in the mutant increased to 14.9 times that of the wild strain. To further understand the intracellular metabolic change for the mutant, Table 2 lists the important metabolic parameters, such as ATP yield and oxidation state balance. Compared with the wild strain, ATP yield in the mutant increased from 2.33 to 2.42mol of ATP per mol of consumed glucose. A reduced oxidation state balance was acquired in the mutant, as shown in Table 2."
11,Discussion,"In this study, the mutants generated by the helium ARTP were confirmed to be E. aerogenes according to the 16S rDNA sequence analysis (data not shown), indicating that the mutation operation worked well under the aseptic conditions. For the ARTP, the power input, the distance between the plasma torch nozzle exit and the sample plate, and the gas flow rate are the key parameters for affecting the bacterial mutation efficiency. To keep the temperature of the plasma jet below 40°C and effective mutations, the RF power input, the distance between the plasma torch nozzle exit and the sample plate, and the gas flow rate were set to 100W, 2.0mm and 25.0slpm, respectively [7,11]. Under these determined operating conditions, the ARTP intensity or dose applied to the bacterial sample will be only dependent on the treating time. In our previous study, by the treatment of S. avermitilis with ARTP, the lethality rate of the cells increased with the exposure time, and at the lethality of around 98.2%, a mutation rate of 30% and positive mutation rate of 21% were reached [11]. Longer exposure time led to high lethality, which affected the mutation rate. Therefore, in case of E. aerogenes, for effective mutation and screening of the mutants, we controlled the exposure time to 3min, and the corresponding lethality rate was 98.9%. For the mutation efficiency of E. aerogenes by ARTP, when the lethality rate reached 98.9%, the occurrence probability of the mutations by ARTP was estimated to be 10−2. Of the mutants, the positive mutation rate which showed the improved hydrogen productivity compared to the wild strain was estimated to be about 10%. The increase ratio of the hydrogen production using the ARTP process was also comparable with that using other physical mutagenesis, chemical mutagenesis or genetically modified methods. In this study, the hydrogen yield of wild E. aerogenes was 0.897molH2/mol-glucose, and that of the mutant generated by ARTP was 1.134mol H2/mol-glucose. The total hydrogen yield of the mutant was increased by 26.4% compared to that of the wild strain. Mahyudin et al. studied effects of chemical and physical mutation methods on hydrogen production of E. aerogenes HU-101 [18]. By treatment of allyl alcohol and proton suicide method, the best mutant of E. aerogenes could finally reach 1.17mol/mol-glucose of hydrogen yield, which was the same level as that obtained by ARTP mutation in this study. Moreover, in our previous studies, we overexpressed formate dehydrogenase FDH-H and formate hydrogen lyase activator protein FHLA in the wild strain of E. aerogenes, its hycA-deleted mutant by knockout the formate hydrogen lyase repressor and hybO-deleted mutant by knockout of the uptake hydrogenase, respectively. Compared with the control strain, the hydrogen yield was increased by 15.7% [14]. In addition, since the fermentative hydrogen production from biomass needs to be performed using mixed culture in the open air, modification of bacterial strains by feasible non-GMO (genetically modified organisms) mutation breeding methods is always indispensable for the improvement of the hydrogen productivity. Therefore, ARTP was proved to be a feasible non-GMO mutation method to generate good mutants of the hydrogen-producing E. aerogenes. One mutant with the highest hydrogen productivity was selected for the further analysis. Improvement of the hydrogen production per liter of medium and per DCW for the mutant showed that the cellular metabolism was altered by the plasma mutation. The general anaerobic metabolites of E. aerogenes are lactate, 2,3-butanediol, formate, ethanol, acetate and succinate [15,16,26]. After 18h of cultivation, lactate, ethanol and acetate were detected to be the main metabolites for both the wild strain and the mutant, which was the same as observed in our previous study [15,16]. 2,3-Butanediol and succinate could be neglected because of their low concentrations. No formate was detected in the medium, indicating that formate was quickly utilized for hydrogen production after its formation in both the mutant and the wild strain [13,16,17]. However, the mutant produced less lactate, ethanol and acetate than the wild strain. In order to examine the changes in the metabolism of the mutant, MFA was carried out in this study, whose validity has been confirmed by our previous study [15]. The MFA was reasonable since the analysis gave a carbon recovery rate of nearly 100%. Incidentally, the total hydrogen yield obtained from the experimental measurements of hydrogen production and glucose consumption was equal to the sum of the hydrogen yields estimated from NADH and formate pathways in the hydrogen metabolism, indicating again that the two pathways contribute to the hydrogen production by E. aerogenes. For the glycolysis pathway, as shown in Fig. 2, the increase of hydrogen production flux from the formate and NADH pathways in the mutants showed larger fluxes of phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate formation. For the mutants, the NADH pathway contributed more to the increased total hydrogen yield than the formate pathway did. Also, these results showed that, in order to achieve a higher hydrogen production yield, control of the NADH pathway will be of significance. Furthermore, two important parameters, the ATP yield and the oxidation state balance were estimated for further illustrating the metabolic change of the mutant by the ARTP treatment. The higher ATP yield in the mutant could provide more energy for cell growth, which was in agreement with the cell growth enhancement of the mutant. The results of the improved cell growth demonstrated that cellular metabolism was changed [25]. In order to calculate the oxidation state balance, the oxidation states of C, H and O were taken as 0, −0.5 and +1, respectively, so the oxidation state of a molecule with a formula of C x H y O z can be expressed as z −0.5y [15,25]. The three anaerobic metabolites in E. aerogenes, i.e., 2,3-butanediol, ethanol and hydrogen, have the respective negative oxidation states of −3, −2 and −1, mainly contributing to the intracellular redox state balance. The change of cellular oxidation state reflected the change of cellular metabolism [25]. Hydrogen production was a result of the overflow of cellular reducing power inside the cells [15]. More negative oxidation states imply an excess of reducing power inside the cells, contributing to the enhanced hydrogen production from the NADH pathway [15,27]. The increase of the hydrogen flux by the NADH pathway, higher ATP yield and more negative oxidation states in the mutant suggested that mutation by ARTP could alter the global metabolism of E. aerogenes. Stability of the mutant was evaluated by serial subcultures. The calculated ratio of hydrogen productivity (hydrogen volume per liter of medium after 18h culture) of the mutant to that of the wild strain remained almost constant during the production of the subcultures. Within the 25 subcultures, hydrogen production stability of the mutant was maintained (data not shown), suggesting that mutation of E. aerogenes by ARTP enabled the mutants with high genetic stability to be generated. In our previous studies, the genetic effects of the helium ARTP were demonstrated by using the plasmid DNA and oligonucleotides [7,10]. The gene damage pattern by ARTP was clearly different from UV and chemical mutagenesis as analyzed by umu test [10]. These preliminary data suggested that ARTP can cause diverse breakage among the bases of DNA. Combining with the ARTP genetic effect [7] and mutation for S. avermitilis, we presumed that the chemically active species generated by the ARTP were the main factors in the mutation of E. aerogenes, which finally changed the global cellular metabolism. However, for living microbial cells, the precise mechanism of the genome mutation by the ARTP is still unclear, which need be further studied by combining with molecular biotechnology such as various Omics technologies for comparative analysis of various mutants and the wild strains."
12,Conclusion,"The helium-based ARTP was used to create mutants of E. aerogenes by globally altering their metabolism and hydrogen productivity. A positive mutant showed improved hydrogen yield, which was increased by 26.4% and mainly attributed to the increase in hydrogen production by the NADH pathway. ATP yield and oxidation state balance indicated that the cellular metabolism was changed by the mutation. The genetic stability of the mutant for hydrogen production was maintained after more than 25 subcultures. This paper indicated that ARTP was effective to generate mutants of the hydrogen-producing E. aerogenes. The increase of the hydrogen productivity from the NADH pathway by the mutant made the strain promising for the further studies of the biological processes."
