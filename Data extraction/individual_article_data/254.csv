0,Introduction,"Higher substituted imines are extensively used as intermediates in the manufacture of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals [1]. Conventional production draws on reductive amination (alkylation) of aldehydes/ketones with amines that are derived from the reduction of nitro-compounds at elevated H2 pressures (4–12 bar) [2–4]. Hydrogen is not a naturally occurring feedstock and current production (ca. 95%) is fossil fuel based, notably by methane steam reforming and coal gasification [5]. Issues linked to sustainable H2 production are now the driver for the search of more efficient routes to imines. Work to date has focused on batch liquid phase catalytic oxidation of amines [6] (e.g. benzylamine over Au [7] and Cu [8]) and oxidative condensation of alcohols with amines [9] (e.g. benzyl alcohol and aniline over Cu [10], Pd [11] and Au [12]) at (O2/air) pressures up to 5 atm. The multi-step nature of the oxidative route where the amine reactant must be generated first is a decided drawback [13]. We propose to integrate the nitro- → amine reduction step (Fig. 1 , step (I)) and reaction with aldehyde (step (III)) in a “one pot” imine production that circumvents multiple reactor operation. The alcohol dehydrogenation (step (II)) is used to generate aldehyde and hydrogen that is utilised in –NO2 hydrogenation. This removes the requirement for an external supply of pressurised H2 and can be step-changing in terms of sustainability and process efficiency. Synthesis of imines via coupling of alcohol dehydrogenation with nitro-compound reduction has not been studied to any significant extent. The viability of batch liquid phase coupling of benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation (as hydrogen donor) with nitrobenzene hydrogenation has been demonstrated for reaction over Mg6Al2(OH)16CO3 supported Pd but amine (>7% yield) was generated as by-product [14]. Xiang et al. [15] have reported imine synthesis from nitrobenzene and furfural over Pd-Au/Al2O3 (with MeOH as hydrogen source). We can also flag work dealing with batch conversion of nitroarenes and benzaldehyde over iron powder (with HCl as hydrogen donor) [16] and nitrobenzene with benzyl alcohol over TiO2 supported Au-Pd and Ru-Pd [17]. A move from batch to continuous processing has significant benefits in terms of economics, high throughput and quality control. This has been identified as a priority for sustainable production in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical sectors [18]. Studies of continuous gas phase operation employing a hydrogen “borrowing’’ strategy have predominantly dealt with coupling of dehydrogenation and hydrogenation [19–22] with no report of cross-coupling of alcohols with nitro- reactants for imine synthesis. Baiker et al. [23,24] studied the formation of dimethyldodecylamine by gas phase conversion of dimethylamine and 1-dodecanol over Cu/Al2O3 and observed loss of activity and selectivity in the absence of an external hydrogen supply. Deactivation has been a feature of coupling reactions involving alcohols and amines over supported Cu and Ni catalysts and attributed to nitride formation, coking and amine deposition [25]. We have previously established the viability of hydrogen transfer (from 2-butanol dehydrogenation) for nitrobenzene reduction over Cu/SiO2 [26]. In this study, we extend that work to evaluate feasible imine production in the absence of external H2 using a combination of Cu/SiO2 and supported Au catalysts with benzyl alcohol and nitrobenzene as reactants (Fig. 1). Nitroarene hydrogenation over supported Au shows a dependency on support reducibility [27], where Au on TiO2 and MgO exhibited differences in chemoselective amine production rates [28]. We evaluate H2 utilisation and catalyst stability as two critical considerations for sustainable imine production."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation and activation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation and activation Cu/SiO2 was prepared by deposition-precipitation with NaOH (Riedel-de Haën, 99%) as precipitation agent. Silica powder (Sigma-Aldrich, 20 g) was dispersed in an aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%, 0.03 M, 200 cm3). The suspension was stirred (600 rpm) at ambient temperature for 1 h and NaOH (2 M) added dropwise until pH > 10 to ensure full deposition as Cu(OH)2 [29]. The mixture was heated in air to 353 K with subsequent ageing for 4 h to facilitate homogeneous deposition [29]. The solid obtained was separated by filtration, washed with distilled water until pH = 7 and dried at 393 K. The dried sample was calcined in air (at 10 K min−1 to 723 K for 4 h) to generate a supported copper oxide (CuO) [29]. Gold on MgO (Sigma-Aldrich, 10 g) was prepared by impregnation with aqueous HAuCl4 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%, 5 × 10-2 M, 50 cm3). The slurry was heated (at 2 K min−1) to 353 K at 600 rpm and maintained in a He purge for 5 h. Gold on TiO2 (P25, Degussa) was prepared by deposition-precipitation using urea (Riedel-de Haën, 99%) as basification agent. An aqueous solution of urea (100 fold excess) and HAuCl4 (5 × 10-3 M, 400 cm3) was added to the support (15 g) and the suspension stirred and heated to 353 K under reflux (2 K min–1). The pH progressively increased to reach ca. 7 after 3–4 h as a result of thermal decomposition of urea. The solid was separated by filtration, washed with distilled water and dried in 45 cm3 min−1 He at 373 K for 5 h. The catalyst precursors were sieved (ATM fine test sieves) to mean particle diameter = 75 μm. Prior to ex situ characterisation and catalytic testing, samples were activated in 60 cm3 min−1 H2 at 2–4 K min−1 to 523–545 K, held for 1–2 h and passivated at ambient temperature in 1% v/v O2/He."
3,Catalyst characterisation,"2.2 Catalyst characterisation Metal loading was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Shimadzu AA-6650 spectrometer with an air-acetylene flame) analysis of the diluted extract in aqua regia (25% v/v HNO3/HCl). Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and H2 chemisorption were conducted on the CHEM-BET 3000 (Quantachrome Instrument) unit with data acquisition/ manipulation using the TPR WinTM software. The sample was loaded into a U-shaped Pyrex glass cell (3.76 mm i.d.) and heated in 17 cm3 min−1 (Brooks mass flow controlled) 5% v/v H2/N2 at 2–4 K min−1 to 523–545 K. The activated samples were swept with 65 cm3 min−1 N2 for 1.5 h, cooled to reaction temperature (498 K) and subjected to H2 chemisorption by pulse (10 μl) titration. The effluent gas passed through a liquid N2 trap and H2 consumption was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). In blank tests, there was no measurable H2 uptake on the (SiO2, TiO2 or MgO) supports. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained using the Micromeritics Gemini 2390p system. Prior to analysis, the samples were outgassed at 423 K for 1 h in N2. Total specific surface area (SSA) and cumulative pore volumes were obtained using standard BET and BJH analysis. Metal particle morphology (size and shape) was examined by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM, JEOL 2200FS field emission gun-equipped unit), employing Gatan Digital Micrograph 1.82 for data acquisition/manipulation. Samples for analysis were prepared by dispersion in acetone and deposited on a holey carbon/Cu grid (300 Mesh). Surface area weighted mean metal size (d) was based on a count of up to 800 nanoparticles according to (1) d = ∑ i n i d i 3 ∑ i n i d i 2 where ni is the number of particles of diameter di . Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of the samples pre- and/or post-reaction were performed on a SDT Q600 simultaneous TGA/DSC analyser (TA Instrument) by monitoring temporal mass and heat flow changes with temperature. The samples (ca. 10 mg) were heated in 100 cm3 min−1 air at 373 K for 1 h and ramped to 1073 K (at 20 K min−1). Elemental (C, H and N) analysis for samples post-reaction was carried out on an Exeter CE-400 elemental analyser. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) analysis was conducted on an Axis Ultra instrument (Kratos Analytical) under ultra-high vacuum conditions (<10-8 Torr) with a monochromatic Al Kα radiation (1486 eV). The C1s, Cu 2p 3/2, Au 4f 5/2 and 4f 7/2, N 1s and Si 2p spectra were collected. Characteristic Cu 2p 3/2 binding energies (BE) for metallic Cu and CuO are 932.8 eV [30] and 934.0 eV [31], respectively. Values in the 83.6–84.2 eV and 87.2–88.4 eV ranges for 4f 7/2 and 4f 5/2 levels have been reported elsewhere [32] for metallic Au. We define adventitious carbon as any carbon associated with air exposed samples [33]. The C 1s profile for this adventitious carbon is characterised by a principal peak at 284.5 eV, indicative of alkyl species (CC, CH) [34], and was used as an internal standard to compensate for charging effects. The spectra were calibrated against the Si 2p (of SiO2, BE = 103.5 eV) [35] and fitted with abstraction of the Shirley background using the Gaussian-Lorentzian function in XPSPEAK 41."
4,Catalytic procedure,"2.3 Catalytic procedure Reactions (stand-alone benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation and nitrobenzene hydrogenation and cross-coupling) were carried out at ambient pressure in situ after activation in a continuous flow fixed bed vertical glass reactor (i.d. = 15 mm) at 423–523 K. A layer of borosilicate glass beads served as preheating zone, ensuring that the reactant(s) (benzyl alcohol and/or nitrobenzene) was (were) vaporised and reached reaction temperature before contacting the catalyst bed. Isothermal conditions (±1 K) were maintained by diluting the catalyst with ground glass (75 μm) and continuously monitored by a thermocouple inserted in a thermowell within the catalyst bed. The reactant(s) was (were) delivered to the reactor via a glass/teflon air-tight syringe and teflon line using a microprocessor controlled infusion pump (Model 100 kd Scientific). Dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol and hydrogenation of nitrobenzene were tested separately in a co-current flow of N2 with benzyl alcohol (GHSV = 1.0 × 104 h−1, molar metal to reactant feed rate n metal/F = 3.8 × 10−3 – 5.0 × 10−2 h) and H2 with nitrobenzene (GHSV = 1.0 × 104 h−1, n metal/F = 8.0 × 10-3–1.2 × 10−2 h), respectively. The coupled reaction was carried out in N2 (GHSV = 2.0 × 103 h−1, n metal/F = 1.2 × 10−1–3.6 × 10−1 h). In blank tests, passage of each reactant through the empty reactor or over the (SiO2, TiO2 or MgO) support alone did not result in any detectable conversion. The reactor effluent was condensed in a liquid nitrogen trap for subsequent analysis using a Perkin-Elmer Auto System XL gas chromatograph equipped with a programmed split/splitless injector and a flame ionization detector, employing a DB-1 (50 m × 0.33 mm i.d., 0.20 μm film thickness) capillary column (J&W Scientific). Data acquisition and manipulation were performed using the TurboChrom Workstation Version 6.3.2 (for Windows) chromatography data system. Benzyl alcohol (Riedel-de Haën, ≥99%), benzaldehyde (Fluka, ≥98%), nitrobenzene (Riedel-de Haën, ≥99%), aniline (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99%), toluene (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), N-benzylideneaniline (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) and N-benzylaniline (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) were used as received without further purification. The (H2, N2, O2 and He) gases were of high purity (BOC, >99.98%). Reactant (i) fractional conversion (X i) is defined by (2) X i = [ r e a c t a n t ] i,in − [ r e a c t a n t ] i,out [ r e a c t a n t ] i,in and composition (N j) with respect to product j by (3) N j ( % ) = [ P r o d u c t ] j,out ∑ j = 1 n [ P r o d u c t ] j,out × 100 where subscripts “in” and “out” refer to the inlet and outlet gas streams, respectively. Activity is quantified in terms of reaction rate (R, mmol molmetal −1 h−1), determined from time on-stream measurements as described elsewhere [28]. Repeated reaction with different samples from the same batch of catalyst delivered raw data reproducibility and mass balances within ±5%."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Cu/SiO2: characterisation (pre-reaction) and catalytic response in stand-alone and cross-coupling reactions,"3.1 Cu/SiO2: characterisation (pre-reaction) and catalytic response in stand-alone and cross-coupling reactions The physicochemical characteristics of Cu/SiO2 given in Table 1 reveal a lower SSA than the silica support (223 m2 g−1) but a comparable pore volume (SiO2 = 0.35 cm3 g–1). Activation by TPR (Fig. 2 (AI)) generated a positive (H2 consumption) peak at the final isothermal hold (545 K) where the H2 consumed matched the requirements for Cu2+ → Cu° reduction (Table 1). Hydrogen chemisorption capacity is a critical catalyst characteristic for hydrogenation applications. We have noted previously low H2 uptake on Cu/SiO2 (25 μmol gCu −1) at ambient temperature [26] that can be linked to the filled d band [36]. Hydrogen adsorption on Cu is an activated process, where Cu/SiO2 showed higher uptake at 498 K (Table 1). This value is appreciably lower than that recorded for silica supported hydrogenation metals such as Pd (1650 μmol gPd −1) [37] and Ni (614 μmol gNi −1) [38]. STEM analysis (Fig. 2 (AII)) revealed the presence of Cu particles at the nano-scale (1–6 nm, Fig. 2 (AIII)) with a surface area weighted mean of 3.1 nm. The coupled dehydrogenation-hydrogenation system requires a higher dehydrogenation rate relative to hydrogenation to ensure sufficient H2 supply for reaction. We first examined separately the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol (in N2) and hydrogenation of nitrobenzene (using an external H2 supply) over Cu/SiO2. Benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation generated benzaldehyde (Fig. 1, step (II)) as the sole product over the 423–498 K temperature range. Toluene formation (≤10% selectivity, step (V) in Fig. 1) was observed for reaction at 523 K. Full selectivity to the target benzaldehyde at T < 498 K is consistent with that reported for K-Cu/TiO2 [39]. Benzyl alcohol hydrogenolysis over Cu/MgO required temperatures ≥ 513 K [40]. We have previously established pseudo-first order kinetics for catalytic dehydrogenation (of 2-butanol) [26] and nitroarene hydrogenation [41]. The associated Arrhenius plots (423–498 K) using the extracted pseudo-first order rate constants (k) are presented in Fig. 3 with an associated apparent activation energy for the dehydrogenation reaction of 37 kJ mol−1. We could not find any reported activation energy for benzyl alcohol conversion to benzaldehyde. The value (20 kJ mol−1) recorded for n-octyl alcohol dehydrogenation (over Cu/Al2O3-MgO) is lower [42]. Nitrobenzene hydrogenation (Fig. 1, step (I)) over Cu/SiO2 resulted in exclusive production of aniline with no hydrodenitrogenation or aromatic ring reduction. The apparent activation energy (32 kJ mol−1, Fig. 3) falls within the range (12–54 kJ mol−1) reported for reaction over supported Ag [43], Pd [44] and Ni [45] catalysts. The prerequisite for our coupled system to work in the absence of an external H2 supply (i.e. in N2) is that the quantity of hydrogen generated in the benzyl alcohol → benzaldehyde step meets the stoichiometry (=3) for the nitrobenzene → aniline transformation (Fig. 1, steps ((IIII))). A four-fold higher benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation rate than nitrobenzene hydrogenation satisfies this requirement. Temporal variations in conversion for reaction at 498 K (where the highest selective benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation rate was achieved) are shown in Fig. 4 . The coupled reaction generated imine and benzaldehyde with no detectable hydrogenolysis to toluene (step (V), Fig. 1) and/or amine from further hydrogenation of imine (step (IV)). This represents the first reported continuous imine synthesis via coupled alcohol dehydrogenation and nitroarene hydrogenation without external H2. Imine generation in N2 demonstrates that the catalyst “borrows” hydrogen generated from the alcohol dehydrogenation (step (II), Fig. 1) with an “auto-transfer” in the catalytic reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline (step (I)). As aniline is a strong nucleophile, it undergoes facile condensation with benzaldehyde to the target imine (step (III)) [46]. This represents innovation in process intensification and enhanced sustainability over conventional multi-stepped methodologies that require an external H2 supply [2,3,8,10,47]. A temporal decline in conversion was observed (Fig. 4). Baiker [23] studying the gas phase (T = 510 K, P = 1 atm) cross-coupling alkylation of dimethylamine with 1-dodecanol over Cu/Al2O3 reported a severe loss of activity that was ascribed to the formation of copper nitride (Cu3N) from NH3 generated by the disproportionation of dimethylamine. Temperature is a critical process variable that influences reaction rate and product distribution [48]. Imine formation rate (R), molar (benzaldehyde/imine) product ratio (N CO/N CN) and hydrogen utilisation efficiency, expressed as the ratio of mol H2 generated from benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation to mol imine produced (H2/CN) are presented as a function of temperature (448–498 K) in Table 2 . An increase in temperature at the reaction stoichiometry (inlet alcohol/nitroarene (–OH/–NO2) = 3) resulted in a greater imine formation rate (by a factor of 50) with a higher imine content in the product and improved H2 utilisation. The increased reaction rate can be attributed to greater hydrogen availability (from the Arrhenius plot in Fig. 3) in tandem with improved H2 chemisorption capacity of Cu/SiO2 at higher temperatures as determined from H2 titration measurements. It should however be noted that product ratio (N CO/N CN) was greater than that (=2) shown in the reaction scheme (Fig. 1) and H2/CN exceeded the stoichiometry requirement (= 3) for full H2 utilisation, necessitating further process optimisation. It has been demonstrated that –OH/–NO2 is critical in determining product distribution in liquid phase cross-coupling [14]. A higher –OH/–NO2 served to increase the imine formation rate (Table 2). This suggests competition between nitrobenzene and benzyl alcohol for surface sites where higher alcohol content in the feed favours alcohol dehydrogenation with greater hydrogen release that contributed to the hydrogenation step. Shimizu et al. [49] proposed that dehydrogenation was rate determining in the coupled reaction of aniline with benzyl alcohol in N2 for amine (N-benzylaniline) synthesis over Ni/Al2O3. Hydrogen utilisation (H2/–C=N) and product ratio (N CO/N CN) were largely insensitive to variations in –OH/–NO2 (Table 2). Incomplete H2 utilisation can be linked to the low hydrogenation activity of Cu catalysts. Incorporation of a second metal with greater hydrogenation capability can serve as a means of increasing imine production. The second metal must not promote side-reactions (benzyl alcohol hydrogenolysis and imine hydrogenation). Supported Pd, Pt and Ni exhibit high activity in the reduction of unsaturated functions (e.g. –NO2 and –C=O) but promote hydrogenolysis, generating a range of by-products (e.g. toluene) [50,51]. In contrast, nano-scale Au has displayed unique chemoselectivity for hydrogenation of –NO2 in the presence of other reactive groups (e.g. –C=O) [3]. Supported Au was chosen in this study as a suitable candidate to improve hydrogen utilisation directed at enhanced imine production rates."
7,Supported Au: characterisation (pre-reaction) and catalytic response in stand-alone dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions,"3.2 Supported Au: characterisation (pre-reaction) and catalytic response in stand-alone dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions It has been shown that –NO2 adsorption/activation at TiO2 and Au-TiO2 interface sites deliver enhanced selective nitroarene reduction rates [52]. In order to probe possible support effects, we also examined the performance of Au/MgO as an additive in the cross-coupled reaction. The TPR profile of Au/TiO2 (Fig. 2 (BI)) exhibits a single H2 consumption peak (Tmax = 378 K) that exceeded the amount needed for Au3+ reduction to Au° (Table 1), suggesting partial support reduction [53]. Reduction of Au/MgO (Fig. 2 (CI)) generated a weak and broad higher temperature (Tmax = 510 K) signal, where H2 consumption (Table 1) was appreciably lower than that required for precursor reduction. This can be ascribed to reduction pre-TPR, during catalyst synthesis and drying [54]. Representative STEM images (BII, CII) and particle size distributions (BIII, CIII) are provided in Fig. 2. Au/TiO2 is characterised by a narrow particle size range (1–6 nm) and a mean (3.2 nm) close to that of Cu/SiO2. In contrast, Au/MgO bore larger Au particles (1–15 nm, mean = 7.7 nm) that is a consequence of synthesis by impregnation, which results in weaker metal-support interaction and agglomeration during thermal treatment [55]. Gold particle size < 10 nm has been identified as critical for activity in hydrogenation applications [36]. A significantly higher H2 chemisorption capacity was recorded for Au/TiO2 relative to Au/MgO (Table 1). This can be linked to the smaller Au particle size [56] and a contribution due to the Au-TiO2 interface [57] that facilitates H2 activation/dissociation. The performance of Au/TiO2 and Au/MgO can be assessed against Cu/SiO2 in stand-alone benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation and nitrobenzene hydrogenation in Fig. 5 . The results establish lower (by an order of magnitude) dehydrogenation rates for the two Au catalysts (Fig. 5 (A)). Negligible activity for gas phase alcohol dehydrogenation over supported Au is consistent with results for ethanol dehydrogenation over Au/SiO2 at T < 523 K [58]. Au/TiO2 delivered a significantly higher nitrobenzene hydrogenation rate than Cu/SiO2 and Au/MgO (Fig. 5 (B)), which correlates with H2 chemisorption capacity (Table 1)."
8,Cu + Au Physical mixtures: catalytic response in cross-coupled reactions,"3.3 Cu + Au Physical mixtures: catalytic response in cross-coupled reactions We first assessed the catalytic action of mixed (Cu + Au) catalysts, varying the Cu/Au molar ratio (10, 20 and 80). The results are presented in Fig. 6 and Table 3 where benzaldehyde and the target N-benzylideneaniline were the only detected products. Imine production was enhanced on incorporating Au/TiO2 with Cu/SiO2 with a rate increase at higher Au content (Cu/Au from 80 to 10). This demonstrates the contribution of Au/TiO2 to harness the hydrogen (generated from dehydrogenation, Fig. 1, step (II)) and promote nitroarene reduction (step (I)) with subsequent condensation (aniline + aldehyde) to imine (step (III)). We envision a synergism between Au and Cu that is illustrated in Fig. 7 . The supported Cu phase promotes alcohol dehydrogenation with hydrogen abstraction (step (I)). Fridman et al. [59] have proposed a two-step H abstraction mechanism for Cu catalysed cyclohexanol dehydrogenation. Interaction between metal and abstracted hydrogen results in the formation of transient (Ru-H [60], Ag-H [46] and Ni-H [49]) species. Hydrogen on Cu sites (Cu-H) can “spillover” across the Cu-SiO2 interface, the physical interface with Au/TiO2 and onto Au sites (step (II)) [61] with auto-transfer in the catalytic conversion of nitrobenzene to aniline (step (III)) and subsequent condensation (step (IV)). Further hydrogenation of imine to N-benzylaniline was not observed. This may be due to competition with nitrobenzene for surface hydrogen. We obtained full hydrogen utilisation (H2/CN = 3) and imine formation (N CO/N CN = 2) over Cu/SiO2 + Au/TiO2 at Cu/Au = 10. This represents unprecedented performance in terms of atom efficiency and hydrogen usage when compared with conventional pressurised batch liquid phase reactions. Activity and selectivity in the coupled reactions over the physical mixture were invariant (at Cu/Au = 10) for up to 6 h on-stream (Fig. 6 (A)), which is a marked improvement in stability relative to Cu/SiO2 (Fig. 4). We could find no published study of catalytic coupled reactions over physical combinations of Cu + Au catalysts. We should note work where mixtures of (graphite) supported Pd (or Pt) with supported bimetallic Fe-Ce exhibited higher stability and activity relative to the individual catalysts in the hydrogenation-isomerisation of 1,3-butadiene to butane [62]. Incorporation of Au/MgO with Cu/SiO2 (Table 3, Fig. 6 (B)) also served to enhance the imine production rate with increasing Au content (Cu/Au = 20 → 10). This is again indicative of a cooperative effect in terms of alcohol dehydrogenation at Cu sites with hydrogen release and use in–NO2 reduction on Au/MgO. The promotional effect was not as significant as that observed with Au/TiO2, which exhibited higher nitrobenzene hydrogenation activity (Fig. 5 (B))."
9,Cu/SiO2 vs. Cu/SiO2 + Au/TiO2: catalyst characterisation (post-reaction),"3.4 Cu/SiO2 vs. Cu/SiO2 + Au/TiO2: catalyst characterisation (post-reaction) Given the decline in activity with time on-stream for Cu/SiO2 (Fig. 4), we subjected a spent sample to characterisation measurements in order to identify the possible cause for deactivation. We also carried through the same analyses for a spent Au/TiO2 + Cu/SiO2 (Cu/Au = 10) physical mixture that delivered full conversion/hydrogen utilisation over 6 h on-stream (Fig. 6 (A)). Catalyst deactivation in reactions involving alcohols and amines (or nitro-compounds) has been ascribed to active site occlusion/poisoning (nitride formation [23], coke [63] and amine/nitro-compound deposition [25]) and/or changes to the oxidation state of the active metal [64]. Analysis by XPS provides information on surface composition and the chemical/electronic state of the supported metal phase. Spectra over the C 1s (A) and Cu 2p 3/2 (B) binding energy (BE) regions are shown in Fig. 8 . The C 1s profile for unused Cu/SiO2 (AI) exhibited a contribution due to adventitious carbon (BE = 284.5 eV) with a secondary peak (BE = 286.1 eV) corresponding to C–OH or C–O–C [34]. An additional peak at 288.7 eV for spent Cu/SiO2 (AII) can be tentatively linked to the carboxyl functionality in benzoate species (BE = 288.6–289.1 eV) [65]. The Cu 2p 3/2 spectrum for the passivated unused Cu/SiO2 (BI) presents a principal peak at BE = 933.2 eV characteristic of electron deficient copper (Cuδ+ = 933.0–933.6 eV) [66]. The spectrum also shows a secondary peak at higher BE (934.1 eV) that corresponds to CuO (BE = 934.0 eV [31]) and may be due to surface Cu oxidation during passivation [67]. Post-reaction (BII), a peak at higher BE (936.5 eV) suggests a surface ionic Cu species [67,68] that can be attributed to copper benzoate formation. The formation of a surface benzoate has been proposed elsewhere [69] for benzaldehyde hydrogenation over oxide (SiO2, TiO2, ZrO2 and CeO2) supported Cu under similar reaction conditions (T = 373–623 K). The occurrence of Cu benzoate resulting from surface reaction of benzaldehyde with water (release from –NO2 reduction) can reduce the number of available active sites and inhibit benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation, limiting hydrogen generation and subsequent nitrobenzene reduction/imine formation. The spectrum for used Cu/SiO2 over the N 1s region (396–400 eV, not shown) did not present any detectable signals. We have no evidence for the formation of copper nitride and/or surface nitrogenous species (T = 510 K, P = 1 atm) as was proposed elsewhere [23]. The XPS profile of the (Au + Cu) physical mixture post-reaction (Fig. 8 (AIII)) exhibits a C 1s peak at 287.8 eV that falls within the BE range (287.3–287.9 eV) reported for –C=O species [70–72] and can be assigned to surface benzaldehyde. Liu and co-authors [71] attributed a C 1s signal at 287.8 eV to residual aldehyde on surface copper during furfural hydrogenation. In the Cu 2p 3/2 BE range (Fig. 8 (BIII)), peaks characteristic of Cuδ+ and CuO were observed with no signal at BE > 936 eV for Au/TiO2 + Cu/SiO2. The comparison of XPS profiles for the spent Au/TiO2 + Cu/SiO2 and Cu/SiO2 suggests the occurrence of surface benzaldehyde and benzoate species, respectively. Suppressed benzaldehyde → benzoate transformation results from the addition of Au/TiO2. The incorporation of Au/TiO2 with Cu/SiO2 provides a more efficient site for nitrobenzene hydrogenation and aniline condensation with benzaldehyde (Fig. 7). This can ameliorate Cu deactivation as benzaldehyde reaction and –NO2 reduction (with H2O generation) proceeds at Au sites. The BE for Au 4f 7/2 (83.2 ± 0.2 eV) and Au 4f 5/2 (86.7 ± 0.2 eV) were lower than the reference Au° (84.0 eV and 87.8 eV) [73], suggesting the formation of an electron rich (Auδ−) phase as a result of electron donation from TiO2 [74]. There was no measurable difference in Au BE pre- and post-reaction (Fig. S1, Supplementary Material). The possible formation of carbonaceous deposits was further evaluated by TGA-DSC and elemental (C, H and N) analysis; the results are presented in Fig. 9 . Pre-reaction, Cu/SiO2 (I) and Cu/SiO2 + Au/TiO2 (II) exhibited a similar (2–3% w/w) mass loss at T ≤ 373 K due to water release (Fig. 9 (A)). Both spent samples displayed an additional higher temperature mass loss that can be attributed to combustion of carbonaceous species [63]. Elemental analysis (see inset Table in Fig. 9 (A)) revealed a higher carbon content on the spent Cu/SiO2 compared with the physical mixture. There was no measurable nitrogen, consistent with XPS results. The DSC profile of the spent Cu/SiO2 (Fig. 9 (B)) exhibited two exothermic mass losses (at 602 K and 702 K) during temperature programmed oxidation, indicative of different structural carbon deposits. The lower temperature exothermic mass loss matches that (553–613 K) corresponding to combustion of amorphous aromatic carbonaceous species [75,76]. Based on the DSC work of Siqueira et al. [77], the exothermic mass loss at higher temperature can be attributed to combustion of (copper) benzoate species. The DSC profile for the used Cu/SiO2 + Au/TiO2 mixture presents a principal mass loss at a lower temperature (582 K) with a secondary shoulder at 690 K. This is indicative of limited deposition of surface benzoate as suggested by XPS."
10,Conclusions,We have established the viability of “hydrogen-free’’ imine (N-benzylideneaniline) production via continuous gas phase cross-coupling of benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation with nitrobenzene hydrogenation and condensation over physical mixtures of supported Cu and Au catalysts. Dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde over Cu/SiO2 (mean Cu size = 3.1 nm) delivered a ten-fold higher rate than Au/TiO2 (mean Au size = 3.2 nm). The latter exhibited significantly greater H2 chemisorption capacity and nitrobenzene hydrogenation rate. Reaction over Cu/SiO2 promoted cross-coupling to imine where an increase in temperature and inlet reactant alcohol/nitroarene ratio (–OH/–NO2) served to enhance imine formation. The Cu catalyst suffered a severe temporal decline in activity linked to carbon (benzoate species from XPS and TGA-DSC measurements) deposition. Low hydrogen utilisation is due to the limited hydrogenation capacity of Cu. Incorporation of Au/TiO2 with Cu/SiO2 resulted in (4-fold) higher imine production rate with full hydrogen utilisation at Cu/Au = 10. This is the result of synergism between Cu and Au where hydrogen release from benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation on Cu is transferred to Au for nitrobenzene reduction (to aniline) and subsequent condensation with benzaldehyde to the imine. The promotional effect of Au/TiO2 was greater than that observed with the addition of Au/MgO due to the greater H2 chemisorption capability and –NO2 reduction capacity of Au/TiO2. Coupled reaction over Cu + Au exhibited stable performance with time on-stream where hydrogenation and condensation at Au sites circumvents Cu deactivation. Our results establish the feasibility of continuous stable gas phase imine synthesis using a “hydrogen borrowing’’ strategy over combined supported Cu and Au catalysts.
