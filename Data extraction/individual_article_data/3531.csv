0,Introduction,"The requirement for alternate resources for obtaining chemicals which are presently derived from non-renewable (in short cycle), fossil feedstocks have attracted researchers across the world to work on the renewable resource, viz., biomass. Among biomass non-edible to humans, lignocellulosic materials (cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin), which can be derived from agricultural wastes have dominated the research domain for chemical synthesis. In an acidic medium, cellulose undergoes hydrolysis reaction to yield glucose which upon further dehydrocyclization gives 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF). Similarly, hemicelluloses (xylans) can yield xylose, arabinose and furfural under the acidic conditions. Once these sugars and furans are obtained, those can act as platform chemicals to synthesize value added chemicals by undergoing oxidation (acids), hydrogenation (sugar alcohols), isomerization, hydrogenolysis (glycols), and reforming (alkanes, hydrogen) reactions. Glucose, derived from cellulose is used as a food additive but it can also be converted to many useful chemicals such as ethanol (fermentation) [1], sorbitol and mannitol (hydrogenation) [2,3], 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (dehydrocyclization) [4], hydrogen (hydrogenolysis/cracking/reforming) [5–7] and gluconic and glucaric acid (oxidation) [8–12]. Gluconic acid has many diverse industrial applications such as, biodegradable chelating agent, water soluble cleansing agent, an ingredient for concrete and as an intermediate in the food and pharmaceutical industries [13]. Calcium gluconate is used as a detoxifying agent after exposure to HF [14]. Gluconic acid has an annual estimated market of 6×104 ton and on industrial scale is currently prepared by fermentation of glucose by Aspergillus niger [10,15]. However, fermentation method has many drawbacks such as slow reaction rate and disposal of dead microbes and excretory substances of microbes [16,17]. To overcome these drawbacks, replacement of enzymes with heterogeneous catalysts is a viable option. There have been few reports on the aerobic oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid carried over supported transition metals catalysts including Pd, Pt, Rh and Au supported on various supports like TiO2, Al2O3 and activated carbon (AC) [8,10,11,18–27]. Among those, gold catalysts have been extensively studied by various research groups [10,18,19,23–27]. It is claimed that gold nanoparticles (NP) supported on activated carbon show good catalytic activity in the oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid done at 50°C [22]. Another report claims better turnover frequency (TOF) values per surface Au atom of 45s−1 at 50°C, pH 9.0 and 56s−1 at 50°C, pH 9.5 in the case of gold catalyst supported on ZrO2 [28]. In most of these studies metals suffer from over oxidation and thus they eventually deactivate [22–24,27]. Study on particle size effect shows that rate of reaction is inversely proportional to Au size indicating that reaction is structure-sensitive. In Au/C catalyst, Au with 1.9nm particle size gives maximum yield [29]. It is also observed that these metals undergo sintering during the reaction and thus drop in activity is reported [30]. Moreover, in all these reactions, homogeneous base (1–20equiv.) is used to maintain the reaction solution pH between 9 and 11. The increase in pH (>11) typically leads to degradation reactions and hence it is required to charge the homogeneous base in continuous mode to maintain the pH [22]. Additionally, handling of corrosive homogeneous base is also a major problem. It is known that glucose oxidation carried out in a media other than alkaline is a very slow process. Under acidic conditions, AC supported Au–Pt bimetallic catalysts show 64% conversion and turnover frequency (TOF) of 295h−1 [8]. Most of the reports use high pressures of oxygen in the reactions. There are only few reports available in the literature on the oxidation of xylose to xylonic acid using heterogeneous catalysts [31]. Electro-catalytic oxidation of xylose to xylonic acid using Au and Pt electrodes in alkaline medium is known [32]. To avoid the use of homogeneous base and to develop a method which is environmentally friendly and harmless, we have employed Pt-supported on solid acid and basic supports. In this paper, we report the liquid phase aerobic oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid (Scheme 1 ) using Pt/hydrotalcites (HT). To compare the results we have also carried out reactions with Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with the addition of homogeneous base (Na2CO3) and solid base (HT). Oxidation of xylose to xylonic acid is also performed. In the US DOE report, sugar alcohols, sorbitol and xylitol obtained by hydrogenation of glucose and xylose, respectively are named among the 12 value added chemicals obtained from biomass [33]. These sugar alcohols are low calorie sweeteners and find application in oral hygiene products. Sorbitol is used as humectant and utilization of xylitol is known in cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. Moreover, sugar alcohols have non-diabetes and anti-caries properties because of low amount of lactic acid formation [34,35]. Recently, exploitation of sorbitol for the production of hydrogen and C5, C6 hydrocarbons has been investigated [6,36]. Additionally, a spectrum of other functional chemicals such as, 1,4-sorbitan, sorbose, isosorbide, glycols, lactic acid, vitamin C etc. are produced from sugar alcohols [37,38]. Due to widespread applications of sugar alcohols demand for those is increasing day by day [39,40]. Sorbitol (annual production: 6.5×105 ton) and xylitol (annual production: 2.4×104 ton) are commercially prepared by hydrogenation of glucose and xylose using (Raney) nickel catalyst [41,42]. However, catalyst deactivation is a major problem in these reactions [43–45]. Efforts have been taken to rise above the disadvantages associated with nickel based catalysts by synthesizing Fe, Mo, Sn, Cr promoted nickel, and nickel supported on ZrO2, TiO2 and ZrO2/TiO2 catalysts [3,43]. Hydrogenation of glucose over supported metal catalysts has been extensively studied by the researchers in the last few decades [2,46–50]. Ru catalysts are expansively used for the glucose hydrogenation, but the catalysts are observed to be deactivating during the continuous use [51]. Typically, neutral (AC, SiO2) [2,46,47] or mildly acidic (Al2O3) [3] supports have been used in the study. Enzymatic conversion of glucose is another route for the production of sorbitol but enzymes, soluble in water are difficult to separate after use and hence intricate to recycle [52]. Xylose hydrogenation using supported metal catalysts and enzymes is well known [39,53–58]. It is shown that hydrogenation of xylose is possible over Ru/C catalyst [59]. Recently, it is reported that the reduced Ni/Cu/Al hydrotalcite catalyst at 125°C and 30bar H2 pressure can convert glucose to yield ca.70% sorbitol [60]. In the current work we have studied glucose and xylose hydrogenation using Pt supported on acidic, γ-Al2O3 and basic, HT supports under mild reaction conditions (Scheme 1). Good yield and selectivity has been achieved at optimum reaction conditions. Even though solid base catalysts have been used in several industries, extensive catalytic studies on them are scanty compared to the solid acid catalysts [61]. Application of homogeneous bases in reactions such as isomerization, addition, alkylation and cyclization is well documented. But the homogeneous nature makes their separation and recycling very tricky. Beside this, use of homogeneous bases makes the overall process corrosive and most of the times it needs to be added in the stoichiometric amount. On the other hand solid bases are easily separable from reaction mixture, safe to handle and can be recycled. In recent past, solid base catalysts such as, basic zeolites, hydrotalcites, apatites, chrysotile, sepiolite, basic metal oxides like MgO, CaO and mixed oxide like SiO2-MgO, SiO2-CaO, Al2O3-MgO, etc. have been used instead of homogeneous bases [61–67]. It is understood that in solid base catalysts like metal oxides, surface O2− species form the Lewis base site [61,64]. Hydrotalcites (HT) are anionic clays having a double layered structure with OH− and HCO3 − groups. They have the general formula, [Me2+ 1−x Me3+ x (OH)2] x+(A n−) x/n ·mH2O and naturally occurring hydrotalcite is hydroxycarbonate of magnesium and aluminum having formula Mg6Al2(OH)16CO3 ·4H2O. They are known to show catalytic activity in numerous base catalyzed reactions such as, aldol condensation, Knoevenagel and transesterification [68–70]. HT supported metal catalysts are applied in the oxidation reactions of alcohols [71]. This class of catalysts shows applications in chemical synthesis, in isomerization reactions and as additive in polymer and in medicine [72–74]. Layered double hydroxides of Mg and Fe have been used in catalysis; water purification and anion exchange [75–77]. Basic nature of hydrotalcites has been studied extensively to use them in few other reactions [78,79]. In this work, our aim of using basic support like HT is to shun the use of homogeneous base in oxidation reactions and to make the overall process environmentally benign and safe. It is thought that properties pertaining to strong interaction between metal and basic support may help us in achieving higher activities in oxidation and hydrogenation reactions."

6,Catalytic reactions and analysis,"2.5 Catalytic reactions and analysis 2.5.1 Glucose and xylose oxidation reactions and analysis Glucose and xylose oxidation reactions were carried out in a batch mode reactor (Parr autoclave, USA) with a teflon beaker. The reactor was charged with 3.9mmol of glucose or 4.7mmol of xylose in 30mL water. Subsequently supported metal catalyst was added. While reactions were conducted using Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, either 0.2g of Na2CO3 or 0.3g HT was added in the reaction mixture. In this work during the course of reaction (intermediate addition) to maintain the pH of the solution, no base was added. The reactor was flushed 3 times with oxygen and then environment of oxygen was maintained (atmospheric oxygen pressure). The autoclave was then heated to desired temperature under slow stirring (100rpm). After attaining the reaction temperature, stirring was increased to 700rpm Reaction mixture was analyzed using HPLC (Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with HC-75 H+ (9μm, 7.8mm×305mm) column while succinic acid (0.5mmol) is used as an eluent (0.5mL/min). The refractive index detector (model no. RID-6A) was used for the detection and calibration of compounds. The calibration of compounds was done using commercially available standards. 2.5.2 Glucose and xylose hydrogenation reactions and analysis Glucose and xylose hydrogenation reactions were carried out in a batch reactor (Amar equipments, India). The reactor was charged with 0.83mmol of glucose or 1.00mmol of xylose in 35mL water. During reactions catalyst/substrate ratio was kept constant at 1:2 (wt/wt). When reactions were conducted using HT, 0.075g of HT was added. Experiments were conducted at temperatures ranging between 60°C and 190°C under 8–24bar of hydrogen pressure. The reactions were conducted for 2–6h. Reaction mixture was analyzed using HPLC (Agilent, USA) equipped with HC-75 Pb++ (9μm, 7.8mm×300mm) column.

7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalysis,"3.1 Catalysis 3.1.1 Results 3.1.1.1 Oxidation reactions Oxidation of glucose was carried out over Pt supported on γ-Al2O3 and HT catalysts in water medium at 50°C under atmospheric oxygen pressure (Table 1 ). The Pt/HT and Pt/γ-Al2O3 +Na2CO3 catalysts gave similar oxidation results (entry 1 and 2). Pt/HT catalytic system without addition of any homogeneous base gave good performance for the oxidation of glucose showing 83% gluconic acid yield after 12h reaction time (entry 1). Along with gluconic acid ca. 8% fructose formation was also observed. Whereas in conventional system in which homogeneous base, Na2CO3 was used along with the Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst 82% gluconic acid yield was observed (entry 2). In this reaction ca. 5% fructose formation also was observed. Careful inspection reveals that actually after 6h, higher gluconic acid yield was observed with Pt/HT catalyst (73%) than Pt/γ-Al2O3 +Na2CO3 catalyst (65%). The Pt/γ-Al2O3 +HT catalytic system afforded maximum gluconic acid yield of 56% after 8h of reaction. In all these experiments, almost complete conversion of glucose was achieved. It is important to note here that in all the reactions besides desired products, we also observed formation of oxalic acid, malonic acid, lactic acid etc. in minor amount (4–5%). Blank run (non catalytic, entry 6) did not show any activity under the reaction conditions. Bare HT could not convert glucose to oxidation products; however, 20% yield of fructose was observed (entry 4), which is in line with the literature wherein it is reported that basic catalysts are capable of isomerizing glucose [80–82]. Similarly, reactions done using only γ-Al2O3 +Na2CO3 (entry 5) did not yield any oxidation product but formation of fructose was observed (19%). These results clearly indicate that not only basicity but metal also is necessary to obtain oxidation products. To check the stability of gluconic acid under the reaction conditions, catalytic runs with gluconic acid as substrate over HT, γ-Al2O3, Pt/HT, Pt/γ-Al2O3 +Na2CO3 and Pt/γ-Al2O3 +HT were carried out and we did not observe any conversions. This clearly implies that gluconic acid is stable and does not participate in any further reactions or undergoes any degradation reactions under our reaction conditions. Table 2 summarizes the results for xylose oxidation reaction. As seen, maximum yield of 65% was attainable with Pt/γ-Al2O3 +Na2CO3 catalytic system (entry 2). On the other hand, Pt/γ-Al2O3 +HT (entry 3) showed maximum yield of 53% and Pt/HT catalyst showed 57% yield (entry 1). Xylose oxidation carried out in the absence of catalyst did not show any conversions (entry 6). Along with oxidation products, arabinose, lactic acid, tartaric acid formation and some other unidentified products were also observed. Formation of the minor products (ca. 5%) arises due to isomerization reaction of xylose when reactions were done using bare HT and γ-Al2O3 +Na2CO3 catalytic systems at 50°C. Our earlier work on the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethyl furfural to yield 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) using Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst in the presence of homogeneous base, showed that increase in oxygen partial pressure gives poor FDCA yields [83]. This might be due to the presence of higher concentration of oxygen in water at elevated pressures which causes oxidation of active metal [84]. In this work we did reactions over Pt/HT with varying pressure (1bar, 5bar) and we achieved marginally less gluconic acid yield at 5bar (51%, 24h). The catalysts could be recycled effectively at least for 3 times with a loss of ca. 10% activity after each catalytic run. This loss of activity might be due to the leaching of Pt in the solution which was confirmed by ICP-OES analysis (please refer catalyst characterization section). 3.1.1.2 Hydrogenation reactions Hydrogenation of glucose was studied over Pt/γ-Al2O3, Pt/HT and Pt/γ-Al2O3 +HT catalysts at 90°C using 16bar hydrogen pressure. Amongst all the catalytic systems, Pt/γ-Al2O3 +HT catalytic system gave the best result (Table 3 ). As observed, Pt/γ-Al2O3 +HT showed 68% sugar alcohols yield with 92% conversion (entry 4). Under similar reaction conditions, Pt/HT (entry 3) showed 39% sugar alcohol yield (80% conversion) and the lowest activity was observed for Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst (8.4% yield, 15% conversion, entry 2). In the absence of any catalyst only 2% conversion with 0.5% sugar alcohol yields is observed (entry 1). Besides C6-sugar alcohols, formation of C5-sugar alcohol (xylitol), ethylene glycol, 1,2-propanediol, glycerol, gluconic acid and levulinic acid is observed. The results clearly indicate that Pt/γ-Al2O3 +HT catalytic system gives maximum yield (68%) of C6-sugar alcohols compared to any other catalysts. The results imply that change in support affects the activity of catalyst and hence reactions with only supports were carried out. It is interesting to note here that without catalyst (†ESI Table S1, entry 1) and with γ-Al2O3 (†ESI Table S1, entry 2) as a catalyst maximum of 4% conversion is possible after 6h. However, when basic catalyst is introduced the conversion increased to 80% (†ESI Table S1, entry 3) yielding 39% fructose and 16% sugar alcohols. As explained earlier (Section 3.1.1.1), isomerization of glucose is possible under the alkaline medium. It is also evidenced that the HT in hydroxide form has the most basic properties which may help achieve higher isomerization activity [85]. Reaction with γ-Al2O3 +HT (entry 4) also showed higher glucose conversions (72%) with 42% fructose and 18.6% sugar alcohol formation. Contrary to the recent report wherein it is shown that alkaline medium (NaOH) yields less sorbitol compared to acidic or neutral medium [60], we observed that better yields are possible in alkaline medium (solid base). Fig. 1 depicts the effect of temperature on the catalytic activity over Pt/γ-Al2O3 +HT catalyst. As seen, increase in temperature to 130°C does not necessarily increase the sugar alcohols yield even though conversion was increased to 99% in 2h. This in fact lowers the yield for C6-sugar alcohols formation (56%) at the expense of increase in the yield for glycols (1,2-propane diol, glycerol, ethylene glycol) and other products like levulinic acid and xylitol (39%). On the other hand decrease in temperature to 60°C reduced the conversion levels to 28% with 21% yield of C6-sugar alcohols. In view of above results, 90°C reaction temperature is optimum to obtain higher conversions (80%) and 58% C6-sugar alcohols yield in 2h of reaction time and 92% conversion with 68% yield of C6-sugar alcohols could be obtained in 4h (Table 3, entry 4). From the figure it is clear that we could achieve very high carbon balance since there is typically only 5–7% difference between conversion and total product yields. It is known from the literature that hydrogen solubility follows Henry's law which means that solubility of hydrogen in water is directly proportional to pressure and temperature [84]. To understand how these factors would play role in our catalytic system we altered the pressures. The increase in pressure from 16 to 24bar did not alter the catalytic results (16bar: 68% yield with 92% conversion; 24bar: 67% yield with 93% conversion, 4h). However, if 8bar hydrogen pressure is used then activity was decreased (54% yield with 93% conversion, 8h). Hydrogenation of xylose is studied over catalysts, Pt/γ-Al2O3, Pt/HT and Pt/γ-Al2O3 +HT at 60°C with 16bar hydrogen pressure (Table 4 ). In these reactions also Pt/γ-Al2O3 +HT catalytic system showed the best activity (82% yield with 99% conversion) among all the catalysts evaluated. It can be seen that highest TOF was observed for Pt/γ-Al2O3 +HT system. The effect of temperature was studied and it was found out that 60 and 90°C reaction temperatures are the best (Fig. 2 ). Although At 60°C conversion is less (82%) than other temperatures, the selectivity for sugar alcohols is highest, i.e. 87.8%. Maximum 82% yield of xylitol+arabitol could be obtained from xylose at 60°C within 4h. Effect of supports on the yields of sugar alcohols has been studied by conducting reactions with bare supports (†ESI Table S2). Similar to glucose hydrogenation, xylose hydrogenation has been studied by applying various H2 pressures. Yield of sugar alcohols obtained after complete conversion, at any pressure, seems to be similar (ca. 80%). But the noteworthy point is that the time required for total conversion of xylose is different. Xylose conversion was 95% at 24bar (80% yield of sugar alcohols), 82% at 16bar (72% yield) and 63% at 8bar (58% yield) after 2h. Complete conversion with 82% yield occurs after 4h at higher pressure but it takes 6h for complete conversion at 8bar Recycle study has been done for Pt/γ-Al2O3 +HT catalytic system for glucose and xylose hydrogenation. In case of glucose hydrogenation, activity decreases by 20% after 1st cycle and 12% after 2nd cycle. However, in xylose hydrogenation, catalyst shows good recyclability up to 3rd cycle with negligible decrease in the yield after each run (1st run: 82%; 2nd run: 80%; 3rd run: 74%). These results can be correlated to the fact that during reactions Pt is not leached out in the solution (refer catalyst characterization section). 3.1.2 Discussion It is well documented that solid base can suppress the cracking reaction, which generally occur on acidic catalysts (γ-Al2O3) [86]. It is suggested that over solid bases no strong adsorption of complexes (through ‘O’ of the product) is possible which means that the products formed will be readily removed from the surface to avoid undergoing further reactions (glycols, coke). This can improve the yield for sugar alcohols and acids derived from C5 and C6 sugars (glucose and xylose) by suppressing further reactions of acids/alcohols and formation of coke. This may indicate the reason for the better results on Pt/HT compared with Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. To prove this we conducted the experiments to check the adsorption of sorbitol on HT and γ-Al2O3. The results presented in Table S3 (†ESI) however shows that there is no considerable difference in the adsorption of sorbitol on either HT or γ-Al2O3. This may imply that to obtained enhanced activity over Pt/HT catalyst compared to Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst weak or strong adsorption of product may not be the reason. It is known from the literature that at the surface of a basic support typically, oxide ions form ion pairs with low coordinated metal ions [87]. Usually, hydrogen molecule is split heterolytically over supported metal (Pt) to give rise to hydrogen ions (H+ and H−). In case of base support, there is a possibility of retention of the molecular identity of H atoms during a reaction as is reported earlier [87]. It is possible that hydrogen ions are immobilized on the set of active sites (O2− – metal cation pair) and that these sites are separated from each other and hence migration and recombination of hydrogen ions to form hydrogen molecule is not possible. This ultimately may give rise to rich environment of hydrogen ions on the support. This pool of hydrogen ions then may be available for the hydrogenation reaction thus increasing the activity of a catalyst. The other possibility for increased activity in case of Pt supported on basic support is that the basic support can give rise to electron-rich metallic particles. In fact it is reported that electron rich Pd particles are possibly formed when MgO is used as a support [88]. A similar phenomenon is also reported for Pt particles supported on hydrotalcites [89,90]. In yet another report it is evidenced that since Pt particle size is almost same in all the tested catalysts, it is the electronic ligand effect produced by basic support that enhances the hydrogenation activity [91]. The strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) is first reported for Pt/MgO catalyst and it was showed that higher metal dispersion achieved by SMSI enhances the hydrogenation activity [92]. In case of our catalysts, better hydrogenation activity with Pt/HT may arise due to SMSI in Pt/HT compared to Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst as we observed that over HT support Pt is well dispersed to give rise to average particle size of 1.9nm while in case of Pt supported on γ-Al2O3 average particle size of Pt was 20–30nm (TEM study, refer Section 3.2). In oxidation reactions metal in zero oxidation state is most active [93] and as discussed above when Pt is present on basic support (HT, MgO) it may have more electron rich environment. This may be the reason for higher oxidation activity for Pt/HT catalyst. Moreover, Pt particle size decreases if there is a strong metal support interaction and thus in Pt/HT catalyst particle size of Pt was observed to be much less than Pt supported on γ-Al2O3. This again will improve the oxidation activity on Pt/HT catalyst. An attempt was made to carefully look at the Pt(4f) core level using XPS as any electronic perturbation associated with Pt can result in changes in the binding energy values Figure S1 (†ESI). Unfortunately, this was not successful as Pt (4f) binding energy values (71eV) falls almost at the same energy for Al (2p) (73eV) making it extremely difficult to get any meaningful binding energy shifts. However, we believe that from earlier reports Pt might present in more electron rich state on HT [89–92]. Besides this we performed TPR studies to know the hydrogen consumption by both Pt/HT and Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The data is plotted in Figure S2 (†ESI). It is evident from the figure that in case of Pt/HT catalyst higher amount of hydrogen (22.9cm3/g) is consumed as compared to Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst (18.8cm3/g). This may imply that Pt present on HT is in more electron rich environment; however, it is essential to prove this point beyond doubt. There is a possibility of catalytic transfer hydrogenation of aldehydes while solid base is used as a support (catalyst). However, this possibility is ruled out in our study as with only HT as a catalyst (in absence of Pt) minor sugar alcohols formation was observed (†ESI Tables S1 and S2). The best hydrogenation activity for Pt/γ-Al2O3 +HT catalytic system can be attributed to the fact that presence of HT may influence the isomerization of glucose to make it available in open chain form. It is proved that concentration of open-chain glucose in water at equilibrium is very small. Dissolving glucose in alkaline medium yields fructose by undergoing keto-enol tautomerizations reactions as known by Lobry de Bruyn-Albeda van Ekenstein transformation. The enolate ion thus formed as an intermediate is present in an open-chain form (in water) and this higher concentration of ion is available for hydrogenation reactions. It is not possible to obtain similar concentration of glucose in an open chain form under neutral and acidic reaction conditions and hence it is suggested that higher yields are possible when Pt/γ-Al2O3 +HT catalyst is used for the reaction (Table 3). It is interesting to point out here the difference in activity/selectictivity for Pt/γ-Al2O3, Pt/HT and Pt/γ-Al2O3 +HT catalysts. Careful observation of the data from Table 3 reveals that when Pt/γ-Al2O3 is used (entry 2) no fructose formation is observed. However, when Pt/HT catalyst is used (entry 3), fructose (isomerization product of substrate, glucose) is obtained in high quantity (14%, 6h). In comparison over Pt/γ-Al2O3 +HT catalyst (entry 4, 3%, 2h) fructose formation was seen. As shown in Table S1 (†ESI) when bare HT is used for the reaction (entry 3) almost 39% fructose formation was possible. Compared to this if bare γ-Al2O3 is used in the reaction no fructose formation was seen (†ESI Table S1, entry 2). Considering this, it is obvious to expect that if a basic support is used to impregnate Pt then higher concentrations of mannitol should form in the reaction (via fructose formation and its further hydrogenation). Now, again looking at sugar alcohols formation data from Table 3, with Pt/HT catalyst sorbitol is formed with 26% yield while mannitol (a hydrogenation product of fructose) has 19.5% yield (entry 3). Whereas with Pt/γ-Al2O3 +HT system, 53% sorbitol yield is obtained with only 12% mannitol yield. Moreover, when Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is used (without addition of any base) formation of mannitol was not observed. These results indicate that higher the fructose formation, higher the mannitol yield and lower is the sorbitol yield (Table 3, entry 3 and 4). We would like to bring to notice that pH of the reaction solution in case of Pt/HT catalyst was observed to be 9.3 while with Pt/γ-Al2O3 +HT catalyst it was 8.4 and with Pt/γ-Al2O3 it was 5.5 (Table 3). This difference in pH makes the variation in products yield, since higher pH enhances the concentration of glucose in the enolate form (open chain) which ultimately leads to fructose formation. The above explanation about presence of glucose in higher concentration in open chain form under alkaline conditions also holds true for oxidation reactions. In oxidation reactions, gluconic acid can be formed in high yields if higher concentration of glucose in open chain form is available in solution. Moreover in Pt/HT catalytic system, reaction solution pH is about 9.3 (Table 1) which means that it falls in the exact range of pH 8–10 at which maximum oxidation activity is reported to be possible [28]. At the same time Pt/γ-Al2O3 +HT system shows pH of 8.7 (Table 1) which is on the lower marginal side of best pH range to obtain higher oxidation results and hence shows slightly less activity than Pt/HT catalyst. As discussed above glucose may undergo Lobry de Bruyn-Alberda van Ekenstein transformation (Fig. 3 ) under alkaline medium to yield enolate ions, enediol and fructose formation. To prove that the higher concentrations of open chain form glucose is possible under alkaline conditions we performed UV studies. From the literature it is very well known that glucose is UV active if it is present in open chain form due to exposure of CHO group. Based on this fact we performed UV of glucose (0.233g) dissolved in only water (10mL) under neutral conditions (pH=6.7). The peak at λ max =266.2nm was visible as a small hump (Fig. 4 ). However, after addition of mineral base (Na2CO3, 0.066g) in the glucose solution (glucose, 0.233g in 10mL water: same glucose concentration solution as was used for oxidation reaction) the peak at λ max =267.8nm was increased many folds. This proves that under alkaline conditions, glucose is present in open chain form. Moreover, we carried out additional studies on using NaOH instead of Na2CO3 as a base. With the addition of NaOH with same mole as that like Na2CO3, we observed additional peak appearing at λ max =310.5nm, which can be assigned to enediol anion as reported earlier [94]. Along with this peak we also observed peak at λ max =270nm ascribed to CHO group. To understand why after addition of NaOH additional peak appears, we checked the pH of the solution and found out that with the addition of NaOH, pH was 13.84 while after addition of Na2CO3, pH of the solution was 11.48. It is hence understood that with high pH values (due to NaOH) glucose is converted from cyclic form to open chain form to yield, enolate ion and subsequently gives rise to enediol formation. We could not perform the experiments with the addition of HT since it is a solid base and after adding the same it is difficult to do UV analysis."
9,Characterizations,"3.2 Characterizations Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of fresh and spent catalysts used in hydrogenation reactions. It can be observed that most of the peaks are retained in the spent catalyst. However, careful observation suggests that in Pt/HT catalyst Pt peaks are very small indicating that Pt particle size may be very small and Pt might be well dispersed on the support. The peaks appeared at 35.23°, 43.34° and 62.63° correspond to the lattice plane (111), (200), and (220) are characteristic peak for the hydrotalcite (JCPDF file No. 45-0946). On the contrary in Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, sharp peaks for Pt could be seen at characteristic peak positions. Diffraction through lattice plane (111) gives peak at 39.70°, similarly peak at 46.20°, 67.22°, 81.22° and 85.67° correspond to lattice plan (200), (220), (311) and (222). These sharp peaks imply that Pt has agglomerated to form big particles. The additional peak at 24.5° in spent catalyst can originate from absorbed carbon species. The TEM images and particle size distribution of fresh Pt/HT catalyst (Fig. 6 ) indicate that Pt nanoparticles of average size of 1.9nm are highly dispersed on HT support. On the other hand, in case of Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, Pt nanoparticles with average size of 20–30nm are present. This information points out that the Pt has a strong interaction with basic support (HT) which helps to have higher dispersions and stabilization of metal particles (Section 3.1.2). The oxidation reactions are structure sensitive [29], and thus smaller particle size of Pt obtained over Pt/HT catalysts are naturally more active than the Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Table 5 summarizes the results on the characterization of fresh and spent catalysts. It can be noticed that surface area of bare HT decreases to 159m2/g after loading of Pt when used in oxidation reaction. However, after the oxidation reaction, surface area decreases to 73m2/g. This implies that catalyst may undergo some structural changes during the reaction. In Pt/γ-Al2O3-spent catalyst marginal decrease in surface area was seen. The temperature programmed desorption study done with carbon dioxide as a probe molecule gave 0.88mmol/g as basicity value for bare HT catalyst (Table 5). The basicity remains almost constant after Pt loading (0.81mmol/g). The TPD-NH3 was done to check the acidity of γ-Al2O3 and Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts (Table 5). The pH values for Pt/HT, Pt/γ-Al2O3 are 9.30 and 5.52, respectively (Table 5). However addition of HT to Pt/γ-Al2O3 changes the pH to 8.5. This is natural since HT has basicity (pH 9.24). The possibility of leaching of Pt during reactions was studied by ICP-OES technique. In case of Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts 3.3% and in Pt/HT 3.2% Pt loading in fresh catalysts was found which is in line with the actual loading (3.5%). The spent catalyst used for hydrogenation reactions shows similar concentration of Pt implying that there is no leaching of Pt in the solution. This result is corroborated by not observing any Pt in the reaction solution. Spent catalyst from oxidation reaction showed loss of only 0.03% of Pt in the solution in the case of Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 0.018% in the case of Pt/HT catalyst."
10,Conclusion,Catalytic oxidation and hydrogenation over Pt supported on basic supports can offer a convenient way to advance the valorization of glucose and xylose to yield acids and alcohols. The oxidation carried out at 50°C is a feasible way to achieve as high as 83% gluconic acid yield by suppressing the side reactions. Sugar alcohols yield of 68% could be achieved with Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst suspended with basic support (HT). The basicity of support might be helpful in stabilizing metal particles to give higher dispersions and make them electron rich which helps in attaining higher yields. The alkaline medium is useful to build higher concentration of glucose in open chain form which readily gets converted to corresponding acids and alcohols. Hence a combined effect of metal as well as acidic and basic sites renders these multifunctional catalysts ideal for both hydrogenation and oxidation of substrates like glucose and xylose.
