0,Introduction,"The coal pyrolysis-based staged conversion technology is an effective method to realize clean and efficient utilization of low rank coal [1,2]. For the past few years, various coal pyrolysis technologies have been carried out pilot scale-up or industrial demonstration in China. However, there are still some problems including tar with low yield and low quality (high content of heavy fractions), difficulty in dust separation and so on [3]. Hydropyrolysis, coal pyrolysis process in H2 atmosphere, is an effective process to promote tar production, and has remarkable effect of desulfurization and denitrification, but is hindered by the high cost of H2 and severe reaction conditions [4–6]. Thus, finding a cheaper hydrogen-rich gas to take the place of pure H2 becomes an important research direction of coal pyrolysis process. CH4 is suggested to be a low-cost substitute of pure H2 owing to the high H/C ratio and large reserves of natural gas, shale gas, coalbed gas and methane hydrate were discovered. Egiebor et al. [7] studied coal pyrolysis in CH4 atmosphere and found radicals as CHx and H from CH4 can react with coal radicals during coal pyrolysis. Wu et al. [8] studied microwave pyrolysis of coal in CH4 atmosphere and found tar yield and content of light-weight oil were improved. Liao et al. [9] studied coke-oven gas as coal pyrolysis atmosphere and found tar yield were improved compared with coal hydropyrolysis at the same H2 partial pressure. Gu et al. [10] investigated the feasibility of using coke-oven gas instead of pure H2 as coal pyrolysis atmosphere. The results indicated coke-oven gas can take the place of pure H2 as coal pyrolysis atmosphere and increase conversion and tar yield. In recent years, several integrated processes of coal pyrolysis with hydrocarbon reforming to improve yield and quality of tar, including CO2 reforming of CH4 [11], aromatization of CH4 [12] and steam reforming of CH4 [13], C2H6 [14] and C3H8 [15] have been developed. The results of isotopic tracer showed that radicals from dissociation of CH4 could stabilize radicals from coal pyrolysis [14–16]. The above researches indicated that amount of radicals as CHx and H in coal pyrolysis atmosphere is the key to enhance tar production. Oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) is a significant way of converting methane directly and efficiently to ethane and ethylene [17]. The scientific community widely agrees that OCM reaction pathway involves three steps: (1) methane activation to CH3 radicals by breaking of CH bond and abstraction of hydrogen, (2) homogeneous coupling of CH3 radicals to C2H6 in gas phase, and (3) oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4 [18]. At first step, CH4 can be activated by oxygen to form CH3 radicals without a catalyst at temperatures above 600 °C [17,19–21]. Therefore, a mixture of CH4 and O2 as atmosphere of coal pyrolysis is expected to acquire high tar yield and quality. Coal pyrolysis in O2/CH4 atmosphere has been studied at pressure of 140 psi and temperature of 450 °C for 17h [22]. The results showed that the mixture of CH4 and O2 as coal pyrolysis atmosphere can improve tar yield. However, the atmospheric pressure and short reaction time are more conducive to the industrial utilization of coal pyrolysis. Therefore, the effect of O2/CH4 atmosphere on tar production during coal pyrolysis under atmospheric pressure for short reaction time should be studied. Herein, coal pyrolysis in O2/CH4 atmosphere under atmospheric pressure for short reaction time was studied to verify its effectiveness in improving tar yield. Effect of reaction temperature on yield, fraction distribution and composition of tar was explored to understand formation of tar during coal pyrolysis in O2/CH4 atmosphere. To better understand the effect of O2/CH4 atmosphere on tar production, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR of tar from coal pyrolysis in N2, CH4 and O2/CH4 atmospheres were also analyzed."
1,Experimental,
2,Coal sample,"2.1 Coal sample Naomaohu coal from Naomaohu coal mine of Xinjiang province, China was first crushed to a size below 175 μm and then dried in vacuum drying oven at 110 °C for 8 h. The proximate and ultimate analyses of Naomaohu coal are shown in Table 1 ."
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure The experiments of coal pyrolysis were carried out on an atmospheric fixed-bed reactor as shown in Fig. 1 . The coal sample of 5 g was used in each experiment. The experiment in N2 atmosphere was carried out with N2 of 200 mL/min, while N2 of 100 mL/min was replaced by H2, CH4 or O2 / CH4 in coal pyrolysis in H2, CH4 or O2/ CH4 atmosphere, respectively. The O2/CH4 ratios of 5:95, 10:90, 15:85 and 20:80 were investigated. The reactor was heated to the reaction temperature with 10 °C/min and the reaction time is 30 min. The liquid and gaseous products were condensed by cold trap at -20 °C. The water in liquid product was separated by using the method of ASTM D95-05e1 (2005). Tar yield ( Y Tar ) was calculated by Eq. (1): (1) Y Tar = m Liquid - m Water m Coal × 1- A ad - M ad ×100% where m Liquid , m Water and m Coal are the weights (g) of liquid product, water and coal, respectively; A ad and M ad are ash and moisture contents (wt.%) of coal sample based on air dry basis, respectively. Char yield was calculated similarly to that of tar. Tar yield is average value of three equivalent experiments, and the experiment relative error is within ±1%. The compositions (N2, O2, H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H6, C2H4, C3H8, C3H6) of gaseous products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) equipped with two thermal conductivity detector and a flame ionization detector (FID). The volumes of compositions in the gaseous products (Vi ) were calculated by Eq. (2): (2) V i = V N 2 x N 2 × x i Where V N 2 and x N 2 are the volume (mL) and volume content (Vol.%) of N2, respectively; x i is volume contents (Vol.%) of H2, CO, CO2, C2H6, C2H4, C3H8 and C3H6."
4,Analysis of tar,"2.3 Analysis of tar Prior to analysis, the water in liquid product dissolved in CS2 was adsorbed by Na2SO4. The obtained tar was concentrated at 50 °C to remove solvent. The compositions of tar were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by GC-mass spectrometry (MS) / FID (Agilent 7890B-5977B). Here, GC–MS/FID was equipped with a HP-5 ms capillary column (30m×0.25 mm×0.25 μm) and helium as carrier gas with 1 mL/min. The inlet temperature, injection volume, and split ratio was 300 °C, 0.4 μL and 50:1, respectively. The initial temperature of GC was 50 °C (5 min hold), and heated to 110 °C at 3 °C/min (5 min hold), then to 190 °C at 2 °C/min (10 min hold), and to 210 °C at 1 °C/min (10 min hold) and to 290 °C at 5 °C/min (5 min hold). The separated substance simultaneously entered into FID and MS at a 1:1 ratio by 3-way splitter with make-up gas device. The content of each compound of tar was determined by FID signal with the area normalization method. The boiling range distribution of tar was analyzed by simulated distillation gas chromatograph according to ASTM D2887. NMR spectra of tar were obtained with a Bruker Advance II 400 M spectrometer."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effect of O2/CH4 ratio on coal pyrolysis in O2/CH4 atmosphere,"3.1 Effect of O2/CH4 ratio on coal pyrolysis in O2/CH4 atmosphere The low tar yield is one of the important factors restricting the industrialization of coal pyrolysis process. In consequence, the effect of O2/CH4 ratio on tar production was understood macroscopically. Fig. 2 illustrates the effect of O2/CH4 ratio on tar and char yields during coal pyrolysis at 650 °C. According to Fig. 2, as the ratio of O2/CH4 increases, tar yield increases first and then decreases as a whole, except at the O2/CH4 ratio of 5:95. The tar yield reaches 18.15 wt.% at the O2/CH4 ratio of 15:85, which is about 1.24 and 1.7 times as those in CH4 and N2 atmosphere, respectively. The char yield shows a downward trend with increasing the ratio of O2/CH4, except at the O2/CH4 ratio of 15:85. The volumes of C2H6, C2H4, C3H8, C3H6, H2, CO and CO2 are shown as Fig. 3 . As the ratio of O2/CH4 increases, the volumes of C2H6, C2H4 and H2 increase and then decrease, and reach the maximum at the O2/CH4 ratio of 15:85. The volumes of C3H8 and C3H6 are basically the same. The volumes of CO and CO2 increase with increasing the ratio of O2/CH4 in all process. When the mixture of CH4 and O2 as coal pyrolysis atmosphere, coal-oxygen and methane-oxygen reactions mainly occur. In methane-oxygen reaction, methane could be activated by oxygen to form radicals as CHx and H which may bind to coal radicals to improve tar yield. However, coal-oxygen reaction may inhibit the release of coal volatiles and decrease tar yield. Coal-oxygen and methane-oxygen reactions compete with each other during coal pyrolysis in O2/CH4 atmosphere. At the O2/CH4 ratio of 5:95, it has the same volumes of C2H6, C2H4 and H2 and higher volumes of CO and CO2 compared with that in pure CH4 atmosphere, which indicates oxidation reaction of coal is dominant and the release of coal volatiles is inhibited. At the O2/CH4 ratio of 15:85, the maximum volumes of C2H6, C2H4 and H2, and higher char yield than that of 10:90 indicate methane-oxygen reaction is dominant and radicals as CHx and H from methane-oxygen reaction bind to coal radicals to improve tar yield."
7,Effect of temperature on coal pyrolysis in O2/CH4 atmosphere,"3.2 Effect of temperature on coal pyrolysis in O2/CH4 atmosphere As previously discussed, the tar yield obtains the maximum at the O2/CH4 ratio of 15:85. The effect of temperature on tar and char yields in O2/CH4 atmosphere at the ratio of 15:85 was studied and compared with those in N2 and CH4 atmospheres, and presented in Fig. 4 (a) and (b). Coal pyrolysis in O2/CH4 atmosphere shows higher oil yield than those in N2 and CH4 atmospheres at the temperature above 550 °C, indicating O2/CH4 atmosphere is more effective for tar production. The tar yield increases with increasing temperature, and achieves 18.15 wt.% at 650 °C, which is about 1.24 and 1.7 times as those in CH4 and N2 atmosphere, respectively. When pyrolysis atmosphere is CH4, the tar yield is improved at the temperature above 600 °C, which may be due to catalytic effect of Fe2O3 and CaO in coal ash on coal pyrolysis and activation of CH4 by CaO to produce H2 [23–26]. The char yield shows a downward trend with increasing in these three atmospheres. Coal pyrolysis in CH4 atmosphere shows higher char yield than that in N2 atmosphere at the temperature above 600 °C. Coal pyrolysis in O2/CH4 atmosphere shows higher char yield than that in N2 atmosphere at 650 °C. The volumes of C2H6, H2, CO and CO2 are shown as Fig. 5 . From Fig. 5(a)–(c), the volumes of C2H6, H2 and CO in three atmospheres increase with increasing temperature. From Fig. 5(a), the volume of C2H6 in O2/CH4 atmosphere is higher than those in N2 and CH4 atmospheres at 650 °C. From Fig. 5(b) and (c), the volume of H2 and CO in O2/CH4 atmosphere is higher than those in N2 and CH4 atmospheres at all temperatures. The volume of H2 in CH4 atmosphere is higher than that in N2 atmosphere at 600 and 650 °C. From Fig. 5(d), As temperature increases, the volume of CO2 increases and then decreases, and reach the maximum at 550 °C. In CH4 atmosphere, higher volume of H2 and char yield than those in N2 atmosphere at 600 and 650 °C indicate cracking of CH4 produces H2 and carbon, which enhances tar formation. In O2/CH4 atmosphere, the decrease of CO2 volume at the temperature above 550 °C indicates oxidation reaction of coal is inhibited and methane-oxygen reaction is dominant. The higher char yield and volume of H2 than those in N2 atmosphere indicate methane cracking reaction has occurred. Both methane-oxygen and methane cracking reactions can promote tar formation during coal pyrolysis."
8,Effect of O2/CH4 atmosphere on fraction distribution of tar,"3.3 Effect of O2/CH4 atmosphere on fraction distribution of tar Tar quality of coal pyrolysis is the key for its processing and utilization. Understanding the effect of O2/CH4 atmosphere on fraction distribution of tar can promote process optimization and industrialization. The effect of O2/CH4 atmosphere on tar production was further understood by comparing the contents of the individual fractions in tar from coal pyrolysis with different temperatures in N2, CH4 and O2/CH4 atmospheres. Fig. 6 shows the effect of temperature on fraction distribution of tar in N2, CH4 and O2/CH4 atmospheres. From Fig. 6(a), the content of light oil from O2/CH4 atmosphere is similar with that from N2 atmosphere, and the temperature has a little influence on production of light oil in these two atmospheres. The CH4 as pyrolysis atmosphere increases the content of light oil obviously at 650 °C and is higher than those of N2 and O2/CH4 atmospheres, indicating the addition of O2 to CH4 inhibits light oil production at 650 °C. According to Fig. 6(b), the content of phenol oil from O2/CH4 atmosphere is lower than that from CH4 atmosphere at 650 °C. This indicates that the addition of O2 to methane is unbeneficial to phenol oil formation compared with pure CH4 atmosphere. The results in Fig. 6(c) show that the introduction of O2/CH4 atmosphere has favorable effect on naphthalene oil production at 650 °C. And the contents of naphthalene oil from coal pyrolysis with different temperatures in N2, CH4 and O2/CH4 atmospheres are close to each other at temperature below 650 °C. The contents of wash oil from these three atmospheres in Fig. 6(d) show that the wash oil content from O2/CH4 obviously increases compared with pure CH4 atmosphere at 650 °C. It is indicated that the addition of O2 to CH4 can enhance wash oil formation at 650 °C. The contents of wash oil from O2/CH4 and CH4 atmospheres increases continuously with increasing temperature. From Fig. 6(e), the content of anthracene oil from O2/CH4 and CH4 atmospheres are slightly higher than that from N2 atmosphere at 600 °C, and the content are 1.6 and 1.3 times as that from N2 atmosphere at 650 °C, respectively. It is indicated that the addition of O2 to methane can improve the anthracene oil content. The change trends of anthracene oil contents with increasing temperature in O2/CH4 and CH4 atmospheres are similar to that of wash oil. Fig. 6(f) shows the asphalt content. The content of asphalt from O2/CH4 is higher than those from N2 and CH4 atmospheres at 550 °C, 600 °C and 650 °C, which indicates that the addition of O2 to methane is conducive to the improvement of asphalt content at temperature above 550 °C. The preceding results suggest the addition of O2 to methane was found to improve the content of asphalt at 550 °C. The contents of anthracene oil and asphalt are improved when O2 is added to methane and the temperature is 600 °C. The addition of O2 to methane shows favorable effects on formation of naphthalene oil, wash oil, anthracene oil and asphalt at 650 °C, but inhibits light oil and phenol oil formation compared with pure CH4 atmosphere."
9,Effect of O2/CH4 atmosphere on composition of tar,"3.4 Effect of O2/CH4 atmosphere on composition of tar The composition of tar was obtained with GC–MS/FID and divided into aliphatics, aromatics, phenols, alcohols and others. A more comprehensive understanding of the effect of O2/CH4 atmosphere on tar production was obtained by comparing the contents of aliphatics, aromatics, phenols and alcohols in tar from different reaction temperatures and atmospheres. Fig. 7 illustrates the contents of aliphatics, aromatics, phenols and alcohols in tar. From Fig. 7(a), the contents of aliphatics from O2/CH4 atmosphere at the temperature above 550 °C are higher than those from N2 and CH4 atmospheres, and the content is 2.46 and 2.07 times as those from N2 and CH4 atmosphere at 650 °C, respectively, which may be that radicals as CH3 from methane-oxygen reactions are directly bonded to coal pyrolysis radicals [27]. The contents of aliphatics from three atmospheres at the temperature below 550 °C are basically same. The contents of aromatics from O2/CH4 and CH4 atmospheres have a certain increase at 650 °C, as shown in Fig. 7(b). The aromatics contents from O2/CH4 and CH4 atmospheres at 650 °C are 1.9 and 1.56 times as that from N2 atmosphere, respectively, which may be due to radicals ( H and CH3.) preventing condensation of coal radicals [28]. From Fig. 7(c), the mixture of CH4 and O2 can enhance formation of phenols at 650 °C, but the content is lower than that from CH4 atmosphere. This indicates the presence of a small amount of O2 in CH4 is unbeneficial to formation of phenols compared with pure CH4 atmosphere. The contents of aromatics and phenols from O2/CH4 atmosphere increase continuously with increasing temperature. Fig. 7(d) shows the content of alcohols. The addition of O2 to methane increases the alcohols content, especially at 600 °C and 650 °C. To sum up, the addition of O2 to CH4 is conducive to formation of aliphatics, aromatics and alcohols, but unbeneficial to formation of phenols compared with pure CH4 atmosphere."
10,1H-NMR and 13C-NMR of tar,"3.5 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR of tar The hydrogen and carbon distribution of tar in N2, CH4 and O2/CH4 atmospheres were determined by 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR, and their spectra are shown as Figs. 8 and 9 . The proton distribution is divided into several parts by chemical shift [29], and presented in Table 2 . The proportion of total aromatic and monocyclic aromatic hydrogen in tar from O2/CH4 atmosphere are lower than that from N2 atmosphere. The Hβ proportion of tar from O2/CH4 atmosphere have an increase compared with that from N2 atmosphere. From these results, it can be inferred that the CH3 radicals could combine with cracked CC or C–H bond in α position of aromatic ring, leading to an increase of Hβ proportion in tar. The carbon distribution of tar in N2, CH4 and O2/CH4 atmospheres were shown in Table 3 [30]. The proportion of aliphatic carbon in tar from O2/CH4 atmosphere is higher than that from N2 atmosphere, indicating the addition of O2 to CH4 can improve the proportion of aliphatic carbon. In addition, the proportion of CH + CH2 in tar from O2/CH4 atmosphere decreases and that of CH3 increases compared with that from N2 atmosphere, which may be CH3 directly combines with coal pyrolysis radicals and extends the number of carbon in alkyl-substituents. This is accordant with the result of 1H-NMR that has higher proportion of Hβ in tar from O2/CH4 atmosphere."
11,Conclusions,"The O2/CH4 atmosphere can improve tar yield of coal pyrolysis under atmospheric pressure compared with N2 atmosphere and tar yield reaches 18.15 wt.% at the O2/CH4 ratio of 15:85 and temperature of 650 °C, which is 1.24 and 1.7 times as those from CH4 and N2 atmosphere, respectively. The addition of O2 to methane was found to improve the content of asphalt at 550 °C and the content of anthracene oil and asphalt at 600 °C. The addition of O2 to methane shows favorable effects on formation of naphthalene oil, wash oil, anthracene oil and asphalt at 650 °C, but inhibits light oil and phenol oil formation compared with pure CH4 atmosphere. The addition of O2 to CH4 is conducive to formation of aliphatics, aromatics and alcohols, but unbeneficial to formation of phenols compared with pure CH4 atmosphere. The mixture of CH4 and O2 as coal pyrolysis atmosphere can improve proportion of aliphatic carbon and extend the number of carbons in alkyl-substituents. The preceding results can drive a conclusion that CH3 generated from methane-oxygen reaction can directly combine with coal radicals, resulting in an increase in tar production and changes in the fraction distribution and composition of tar."
