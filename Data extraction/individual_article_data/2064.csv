0,Introduction,"The advent of the integrated biorefinery promises access to the individual components of lignocellulosic biomass for the production of biobased chemicals and materials [1,2]. The lignin fraction is of particular importance as it is the second most abundant biopolymer after cellulose, comprising up to 30% of the total renewable carbon on Earth and is the principal natural source of aromatics [3–7]. Lignin is generated by the oxidative polymerization of three primary monolignols, coniferyl alcohol, sinapyl alcohol, and para-coumaryl alcohol, leading to the formation of guaiacyl (G), syringyl (S), and para-hydroxyphenyl (H) units, respectively (Fig. 1 a) [2,5,8]. The coupling generally occurs at the β-position of the monolignol species, generating arylglycerol-β-aryl ethers (β-O-4), pinoresinol (β-β), diaryl ethers (4-O-5′), biphenyls (5–5’) and phenylcoumarans (β-5) as the five most common interunit linkages, with the β-O-4 predominating (about 50% of the linkages in most lignocellulosic plants, Fig. 1b) [9–11]. In 2010, an estimated 50 million tons of lignin was obtained as a coproduct of cellulose production in the paper and pulp industry. Most of that lignin, roughly 98%, was consumed in situ as a power source, with only 2% being used as a chemical feedstock [12,13]. In contrast, it has been estimated that an expanded biorefining industry may generate over 65 million tons of available lignin or as much as 60% more than is needed to satisfy internal energy requirements [14]. But regardless of its source, lignin remains underused for chemical production because of its heterogeneous structure [15–17] and the limited technology for its selective conversion [9,18] We have suggested that one approach to improved lignin utilization would be to isolate and convert lignin very early in any production process [19]. This concept has since evolved into the “lignin first” approach, and has resulted in a number of elegant processes for the transformation of whole biomass into useful chemicals and materials [20,21]. Nonetheless, given that the focus of biomass conversion remains on the production of fuel, the great majority of biorefinery operations still depend on a sequence of biomass pretreatment and generation of an isolated residual lignin [22–24]. The lignin's functional group profile resulting from any isolation process is critical to decisions regarding the process most suitable for its conversion to high value compounds. As a result, development of conversion processes tailored to these isolated lignins are of current high interest to the biorefining industry [2,8,13,25–39] with catalytic methods being of particular interest [18,37] We have carried out extensive work in the use of organosolv pretreatment to isolate a highly pure lignin fraction that shows improved reactivity as a chemical feedstock and which we believe would be ideal for tailored catalytic conversion [40–44]. Detailed NMR analysis of this lignin revealed that its functional group profile contains a high proportion of benzyl ethers and alcohols, along with the introduction of carbonyl groups at the benzyl position of the lignin aromatic substructures (Fig. 2 ) [45]. Examination of this functional group profile in the context of catalytic conversion led us to consider directed carbon-hydrogen activation (CHA) as a selective means to modify lignin's structure. The structural features introduced during organosolv lignin production are well recognized as directing groups for catalytic CHA, which allows cleavage of a C–H bond and installation of a wide range of functionality [46] ortho to the directing group in a straightforward and atom-economical manner [47–52]. Murai's complex, [RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3], (1) has been shown to be particularly active for the catalytic ortho-alkylation of appropriately substituted aromatic ketones [53–56]. The scope of the Murai reaction is broad, and includes cyclic aromatic and heteroaromatic ketones. The olefinic component includes vinyl silanes and aromatic or aliphatic olefins [53]. Alkylation is initiated by the formation of the catalytically active Ru (0) species 1a via olefin-assisted elimination of hydride ligands from 1 (Fig. 3 ) [57–60]. Given the close correlation between those functional groups best suited for enabling the Murai reaction and the functional group profile of the lignin we are able to generate from our organosolv process, we hypothesized that CHA could be used for the alkylation of organosolv lignin or its fractions. Further, research related to lignin functionalization using the Murai reaction is scarce. Recently, acylation of biomass-derived 2-formyl heteroaromatics using the Murai reaction was reported, showing the applicability of this reaction to lignocellulosic biomass functionalization [61,62]. Accordingly, we have conducted out an initial investigation into the reactivity of discrete monomeric, dimeric and polymeric lignin models bearing different benzylic and ring substitutions with olefins under Murai conditions. Our goal was to understand the reactivity of several different functional groups as a basis for later catalytic studies with isolated lignin. With respect to the eventual use of this process for lignin functionalization, our study examines the ease of alkylation as a function of the substrate complexity, the model employed (phenolic, non-phenolic), and a matrix of reaction conditions (time, substrate/olefin ratio and catalyst loading)."
1,Results and discussion,
2,Alkylation of monomeric and dimeric lignin models bearing a benzylic keto group,"2.1 Alkylation of monomeric and dimeric lignin models bearing a benzylic keto group The Murai reaction uses a carbonyl group at the benzylic position of an arene as a directing group for the alkylation of the ortho-C-H bond. Initial screening reactions with several different directing groups (see SI) confirmed that carbonyl directing groups were optimal. Based on this, we tested different monomeric and β-O-4 dimeric lignin models with a carbonyl group in the benzylic position (Fig. 4 ). The monomeric lignin models are commercially available, and the dimeric lignin models were synthesized by bromination of the starting acetophenone, followed by reaction with phenol in presence of K2CO3 (See Experimental section). The results of the alkylation reaction of lignin models 2a - 2f with 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene (3) using catalyst 1 are shown in Table 1 . Carrying out the reaction for 18 h with a 4:1 ratio of olefin/substrate afforded an excellent yield (76%) of the dialkylated acetophenone 5, along with 7% of the monoalkylated 4 (Table 1, entry 1). Similar results were found for lignin model 2b, which afforded 90% CHA products (72% dialkylated 7 and 18% monoalkylated 6, entry 2). The synthesis of compounds 5 and 7 are noteworthy given that large alkyl groups were effectively introduced between flanking substituents leading, in the case of compound 7 to a hexasubstituted arene. When dimeric model 2c was treated with a twofold excess of olefin 3 in the presence of 1, monoalkylated product 8 was obtained in good yield (Table 1, entry 3), while alkylation of monomethoxy model 2d required a fourfold excess of 3 to get a reasonable yield of monoalkylated product 9 (43%). In contrast to monomeric models 2a and 2b, increasing numbers of OMe groups led to significantly lower yields of alkylation. Compound 2d gave a 19% yield of dialkylated product 10 (Table 1, entry 4), while 2e and 2f afforded no dialkylation. Monoalkylated product 11 was obtained in a 28% yield when the dimethoxy model 2e was used (entry 5) while trimethoxy dimeric lignin model 2f gave a low yield of monoalkylated product 12 (Table 1, entry 6). We initially assumed that the lower yield for alkylation of dimeric models was the result of greater steric hindrance at the site of alkylation. Our ability to generate the highly substituted 7, however, argued against a strictly steric explanation. A series of experiments with phenolic lignin models offered additional insight. Since phenolic groups are present in both native and technical lignin, we investigated alkylation of phenolic models 13a - 13c with 3 catalyzed by 1 (Fig. 5 ). In each case, using a variety of conditions, we found that monomeric phenols did not undergo coupling with 3 (Table 2 ), but instead afforded recovery of starting material (Table 2, entries 1–5). Of particular interest was a competitive reaction using a mixture of nonphenolic model 2a, which successfully undergoes coupling (Table 1, entry 1), and an equimolar amount of phenolic model 13a. After 16 h of reaction, coupling was fully inhibited (Table 2, entry 6). Repeating the reaction with 0.5 eq of pure phenol (Table 2, entry 7) also led only to the recovery of starting material. To test whether catalyst 1 was preferentially coordinating to the phenol oxygen instead of carbonyl, which would prevent alkylation, we examined the alkylation of the sterically hindered phenolic acetophenone 13c, whose t-Bu groups flanking the phenolic OH would be expected to inhibit catalyst coordination. No coupling product was isolated from the reaction of 13c after either 1 or 24 h of reaction (Table 2, entries 4 and 5). We suggest that deactivation of 1 results from its reaction with the acidic hydrogens of the phenolic substrate, which has been shown to deactivate the catalyst [63]. Importantly, catalyst 1 has been used under different conditions for the hydrogenolysis of the aryl-ether C–O bond of β-O-4 lignin models structurally similar to 2c-f to generate acetophenones and phenols [64–66]. Under those conditions, phenols were observed in low yield (6%) in the presence of catalyst 1 (eqn (1). Accordingly, although the reactions are not quenched, the lower yields of alkylated products observed with our dimers may result from increased steric hindrance coupled with trace amounts of phenols formed from cleavage of the β-O-4 bond. (1) Sterics play a role in the regiochemistry of alkylation. For example, monoalkylation of the 3,4-dimethoxy substituted lignin models 2a and 2e occurs selectively at the sterically less crowded of the two available ortho-positions [58]. Although it has been reported that the oxygen of the meta-methoxy group has a directing effect in the ortho-C-H bond activation of acetophenones [59], this is overcome by the buttressing effect generated by the steric interaction of the adjacent methoxy groups [58]. For the 3,4,5-methoxy substituted dimeric model 2f, this effect, when combined with the much larger substituent at the alpha-position of the carbonyl reduces the overall yield of the alkylated product by making it harder for the metal center to bind the C–H bond for both ortho positions (Fig. 6 ). Based on the generally accepted mechanism of the Murai reaction [57–60], dialkylated products are formed without dissociation of the monoalkylated products when electron-donating groups are present in the para-position (eqn 2) [57]. Once the Ru catalyst complexes the ketone substrate, the π-electron-donating methoxy group at the para-position stabilizes intermediate 14 by resonance, which allows the Ru center to cleave the other ortho-H atom and react further with an excess of olefin to generate the dialkylated product 15 [57,58]. (2)"
3,Alkylation of α-benzylic alcohol lignin models,"2.2 Alkylation of α-benzylic alcohol lignin models Benzylic alcohols and ethers are present in native lignin and are also introduced during organosolv isolation of lignin, but our preliminary screening suggested that they were ineffective as directing groups for Ru-catalyzed CHA (see SI). We therefore developed an indirect approach using a tandem oxidation/CHA for the alkylation of the α-benzylic alcohol lignin models in Fig. 7 catalyzed by 1. In this process, the benzyl alcohol is converted to the corresponding ketone in situ via catalytic transfer hydrogenation of the olefin, resulting in a substrate that undergoes CHA (Fig. 8 ) [68,69]. The catalytically active Ru (0) species 1a, generated as in Fig. 3, serves a dual role. Initially, 1a oxidatively adds to the OH bond of the benzylic alcohol 17 to form hydrido (alkoxy)ruthenium species 18. After β-hydride elimination, the corresponding ketone 2c results. The ruthenium dihydride species generated after oxidation then reacts with excess olefin to regenerate the Ru (0) species that catalyzes the desired CHA reaction with the newly generated ketone [70]. It has been proposed that the oxidation of the alcohol can also be catalyzed by the Ru(II)-hydride complex [68]. This approach provided a successful one-pot approach for the alkylation of benzylic alcohols with 3 (Table 3 ) [68,69]. Lignin model 16a underwent oxidation/CHA with an excess of olefin 3 to afford dialkylated product 19 in 78% yield (Table 3, entry 1) along with a small amount of 4′-methoxy acetophenone (2g). Increasing the number of methoxy groups on the benzylic alcohol influences the kind and amount of CHA alkylation product formed. After 24 h of reaction with dimethoxy model 16b, an excellent yield of alkylated products is observed, with most of the material being dialkylated product 5 (67%), along with 24% of the monoalkylated product 4 (Table 3, entry 2). As with the oxidation of substrate 2a, monoalkylation occurs at the least hindered ortho site of the benzyl alcohol. Compound 16c also undergoes a smooth oxidation/alkylation in high yield, with the proportion of mono-vs dialkylation being a function of the amount of olefin used. When using 2.5 equivalents of alkene 3/mol of 16c, monoalkylated product 6 was isolated as the major product (Table 3, entry 3), whereas increasing the amount of 3 to 4 equivalents/mol increased the amount of the dialkylated product 7 from 13 to 45% (Table 3, entry 4). Also, in the first case, a small amount of residual ketone 2b was detected, whereas, in the latter, no ketone was isolated. Finally, we also examined the alkylation of dimeric model 17. Our results show that the alkylation of 17 is affected by reaction time and olefin concentration. Using a smaller excess of olefin, the alkylation is sluggish, and affords a 27% yield of monoalkylated product after 24 h of reaction. Increasing the amount of olefin 12 from 2.5 to 4 equivalents almost doubles the amount of monoalkylated product 8 (Table 3, entries 5 and 6), while doubling both the time of reaction and the amount of olefin to increases the yield of 8 to 71% (entry 7). The lack of the π-electron-donating methoxy group at the para position of model 17, which, as we showed in the last section, facilitates the formation of dialkylated products, and explains why dialkylated products were not formed in the reaction even when using a high amount of olefin."
4,CHA of polymeric lignin models,"2.3 CHA of polymeric lignin models After evaluation of the alkylation of monomeric and dimeric lignin models, the alkylation of polymeric lignin models 20 and 21 (Fig. 9 ) was also examined. Lignin model 20 was prepared by the polymerization of 2-bromo-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethenone in the presence of K2CO3, whereas 21 was obtained by the NaBH4 reduction of polymer 20 [71,72]. These polymeric lignin models mimic the linear structure of a series of linked β-O-4 units and have been employed in parallel studies on lignin valorization [64,73,74]. Polymers 20 and 21 were characterized using FTIR and NMR, and their spectra are similar to those reported previously [71]. Polymer 21 exhibited an Mn = 3120-4288 and Mw = 7045–7310, also similar to reported values [64,71]. We evaluated different treatments for the CHA of these polymers which are summarized in Table 4. After each reaction, the mixture was filtered and the precipitate was collected, dried, and characterized by NMR and FTIR. Under the same alkylation conditions as were used for the dimeric models, ketone model 20 was reacted for 24 h with 4 equivalents of olefin 3 (Table 4 , entry 1). FTIR analysis showed only minimal differences from the starting polymer (K1, Fig. 10 ). The 1H NMR spectra showed no significant change in the polymeric structure after treatment. We also examined the effect of increasing the loading of catalyst, the reaction time, and the olefin concentration (K2, Table 4, entry 2), and observed minimal change from the NMR of the starting polymer. In contrast, when alcohol model 21 was subjected to the tandem oxidation/CHA conditions, we observed an initial formation of ketone groups (product A1) based on the appearance of a CO stretching band at 1674 cm−1 (Fig. 11 ). This change can be attributed to oxidation of the α-alcohols of the polymeric lignin model by the catalyst, similar to the transformations summarized in Tables 3 and 4. NMR analysis of the reaction product from 21 before and after reaction also revealed the appearance of hydrogens associated with methyl groups from the 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene, suggesting that oxidation/alkylation may be occurring, but because the yields are low we are unable to verify the extent of alkylation. Factors that reduce the effectiveness of alkylation of monomeric and dimeric models also may be influencing the poor behavior of 20 and 21 towards alkylation. Sterically, the models contain regular repeating β-O-4 units which differs from isolated lignin, in that the models will exhibit improved packing of the polymer chains, reducing access to the reactive alkylation sites. In addition, any phenol generated from C–O bond cleavage may cause deactivation of the catalyst. The OH endgroups on the polymer may also be affecting the reaction, but based on the results shown in Table 2, we do not believe their concentration is high enough to fully quench the reaction. These observations may be compounded by the low solubility of the polymers [64,71]. Changing the reaction medium to 1,4-dioxane or a mixture of 1,4-dioxane and toluene (1:1) was also evaluated, but the result was similar. Future work will examine optimizing the CHA reaction for more complex lignin oligomers and polymers, for example, by employing organosolv lignin, which exhibits good solubility in common organic solvents."
5,Conclusions,"Our study has shown that the Murai CHA reaction successfully functionalizes monomeric and dimeric lignin models in good to excellent yield. Although alkylation occurs first at the least crowded ortho-position of the arene, the ability to introduce functionality into sterically crowded locations on the models is noteworthy. Further, substituted benzyl alcohols also undergo alkylation via a tandem oxidation/alkylation sequence. When combined with the ability to introduce appropriate CHA directing groups into lignin via organosolv processing of lignocellulosic biomass, this new methodology suggests a potentially powerful approach for lignin functionalization and valorization in the biorefining industry. While sterics play a role in the effectiveness of the reaction, the sensitivity of 1 to the presence of free phenolic units indicates that capping of the phenols in technical lignin (e. g., via acetylation or silylation) will be effective [67]. The ability to functionalize polymeric lignin will obviously be the next step to achieve in this research, utilizing isolated organosolv lignin, which has improved solubility in comparison the polymeric models examined in this paper. These approaches will be examined in future work."

9,Synthesis of α-benzylic alcohols,"4.3 Synthesis of α-benzylic alcohols Different monomeric lignin model compounds were synthesized using a method similar to that reported in a previous study [74,75,81] 1-(4-Methoxyphenyl)-1-ethanol (16a).
