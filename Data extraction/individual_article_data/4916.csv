0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is an emerging new energy carrier with significant environmental impact as its combustion is clean of pollutants. It is anticipated that in medium to long term, hydrogen will be a key player in the global economy. Nowadays, a large amount of hydrogen that is commercially used for ammonia production and refining processes, is produced from fossil fuels such as natural gas, naphtha, heavy oil and coal via catalytic reforming and partial oxidation processes [1]. One of the limitations of current hydrogen generation is the depletion of these sources and the substantial amounts of CO2 emitted to the atmosphere during the process steps associated with its production. Biomass has been proposed as an alternative feedstock for hydrogen production not only because it is renewable but also because it is a CO2 neutral energy supply. Hydrogen can be produced from biomass mainly via two thermochemical processes, the gasification [2,3] and the flash pyrolysis [4–6] followed by steam reforming of the pyrolysis oil. Fast pyrolysis of biomass produces 60–75wt% of liquid, 15–25wt% of solid char, and 10–20wt% of non condensable gases, depending on the feedstock used [7]. The pyrolysis oil, known as bio-oil, is a mixture of acids, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, ketones, sugars, phenols, guaiacols, syringols, furans, and multifunctional compounds [8]. With the addition of water, bio-oil, can be separated in two distinct fractions: a monomer-rich aqueous fraction (containing typically 20wt% organics) and a hydrophobic fraction composed mainly of oligomers derived from lignin [9]. Steam reforming can be used to convert the entire bio-oil or each of the fractions of the oil to a hydrogen rich stream. Despite the fact that the hydrogen yields obtained from the whole oil are higher than when only the aqueous, carbohydrate-derived fraction is processed, the economics of the whole bio-oil reforming are less favorable [10]. On the other hand, the water-insoluble fraction can be used in high value applications producing phenolic resins and fuel additives [11]. An integrated approach in which the water insoluble fraction of the bio-oil is used for the production of high added value products and the water soluble one is steam reformed to hydrogen, presents certain advantages in terms of feasibility. Our research activities in biomass utilization focus on the production of hydrogen via reforming of the aqueous fraction of bio-oil. Thermodynamic calculations of steam and autothermal reforming of particular model compounds of bio-oil, acetic acid, ethylene glycol and acetone, were performed in order to define the optimum conditions for maximizing hydrogen production [12,13]. It was found that the bio-oil oxygenates in the presence of steam are easily converted to hydrogen rich mixtures achieving maximum hydrogen yield (80–90%) at 625°C without any coke formation for operation under atmospheric pressure and steam/carbon >1. During the last decade, steam reforming of bio-oil components, has been persistently studied, focusing on acetic acid as one of the most representative compounds [14–28]. Chornet and coworkers [14,15] explored the mechanism of thermal decomposition and steam reforming reactions over commercial Ni reforming catalysts. The effect of different parameters like temperature, steam to carbon ratio and space velocity was investigated in the presence of commercial Ni [16] and Ni–Al coprecipitated catalysts [17,18]. The influence of the metal (Ni and noble metals) and the support type (Al2O3, La2O3/Al2O3, MgO/Al2O3) on acetic acid reforming were investigated by Basagiannis and Verykios [19,20,21]. Steam reforming of model compounds and full bio-oil was investigated over Pt, Pd and Rh supported on ZrO2, Al2O3 and CeO2–ZrO2 [22,23]. Much less attention has been given to acetone steam reforming. It was mainly investigated as a by-product of acetic acid reforming in the presence of commercial nickel [16,22] and Pt/ZrO2 catalysts [24] and over Pd–Cu/γ-Al2O3 catalyst under auto-thermal and endothermic steam reforming conditions of C3 organics [25]. A serious side effect of the reforming reactions is the formation of carbonaceous species, which deposit on the catalyst surface. Carbon deposits on the catalyst can be minimized by inhibiting the surface reactions leading to solid carbon formation via the presence of specific metals [22] and by the use of specially designed reactors [26]. The concept of sequential cracking and coke burn off was successfully studied by the group of Mirodatos and coworkers [27,28] as an alternative heat integrated process for bio-oil processing. Earlier work on methane steam reforming, partial oxidation and dry reforming demonstrated the superior performance of Ni catalysts supported on various types of calcium aluminates [29–33]. These catalysts showed high hydrothermal stability, low coke productivity and high hydrogen yield. The molar ratio of CaO to Al2O3 and the catalyst preparation method has been reported as crucial factors that affect both the activity and the coke production rate in methane dry reforming and partial oxidation [30,34]. The aim of the present work is to investigate the thermal decomposition/reforming in the absence/presence of steam and the catalytic steam reforming of two representative bio-oil components, acetic acid and acetone. The influence of active metal (Ni and noble metals) and the type of calcium aluminate used as catalysts support on hydrogen yield and coke deposition is evaluated for acetic acid and acetone steam reforming."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The carriers employed, xCaO·yAl2O3 with two different molar ratios x/y =l/2 and 12/7, were prepared by solid state reaction between CaCO3 (J.T. Baker, Analyzed Reagent) and γ-Al2O3 (Catapal alumina) calcined at 1100°C for 20h. The particles formed were grounded and the fraction 108–180μm was used for catalyst preparation. Details on their preparation can be found elsewhere [35]. The wet impregnation method was applied for the preparation of catalysts. The precursors used for Ni, Rh and Ir metals were Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, RhCI3·3H2O and IrCl3·4H2O, respectively. The aqueous solutions of the precursors were mixed with the support particles and stirred for 1h at 70°C. The solvent was removed via evaporation under mild vacuum conditions and the samples afterwards were dried overnight at 120°C. The catalysts were calcined in air flow at 600°C for 4h and at 900°C for 6h. The nominal metal composition of the final catalysts was 5wt% for Ni and 0.5wt% for noble metals Rh and Ir. The catalysts were reduced at 750°C in 25% H2/He flow for l h before the reforming experiments. The catalysts are referred to as zMe/Ca2Al (where z is the metal wt% and Me is Ni, Rh or Ir) for samples supported on CaO·2Al2O3 and zMe/12Ca7Al for those supported on 12CaO·7Al2O3."
3,Catalyst-characterization,"2.2 Catalyst-characterization X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Siemens D500 diffractometer, with Cu-Kα radiation. The morphology of the synthesized materials was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on a JEOL 6300 microscope, coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX; Oxford Link ISIS-2000) for local elemental composition determination. The surface area of the calcium aluminate catalysts was measured by N2 adsorption at 77K, using the multipoint BET analysis method with an Autosorb-1 Quantachrome flow apparatus. The samples were dehydrated in vacuum at 250°C overnight, before surface area measurements. NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) was used to determine the acidic properties of the catalysts. The experiments were performed in a gas flow system using a U-tube reactor connected online with a quadrupole mass analyzer (Omnistar, Balzers). The catalysts (200mg) were pretreated at 650°C for 0.5h and then cooled to 100°C under He flow. The pretreated samples were saturated with 5% NH3/He for 1h at 100°C, with subsequent flushing with helium at 100°C for 1h to remove the physisorbed ammonia. TPD analysis was carried out from 100 to 700°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min. Quantitative analysis of the desorbed ammonia was based on (m/z) 15. The used catalysts were transferred to a CHN stoichiometric analyzer LECO 800, for the measurement of the carbon deposited on the catalyst."
4,Catalytic testing,"2.3 Catalytic testing The experiments were performed at atmospheric pressure in a laboratory unit equipped with a mass flow controlled system, a fixed bed quartz reactor and an online gas chromatograph. An HPLC pump (Gilson 350) was used for the feeding of the liquid reactants (a mixture of acetic acid or acetone and water) to the reactor through a preheater. The fixed bed quartz reactor was equipped with coaxial thermocouple for temperature monitoring. The external diameter of the reactor tube in the catalytic zone is 10mm whereas the external diameter in the pre- and post-catalytic sections is 6mm to minimize the extent of gas phase reactions. The reactor was heated electrically by a tubular furnace, with three independently controlled temperature zones. The temperature in the middle of the catalytic bed was measured with a coaxial thermocouple. The hot gases exiting the reactor were cooled to condense the liquid products and the unconverted reactants. The gas phase products were analyzed with an online gas chromatograph (Varian 3700) equipped with TCD. To separate the products, two columns were used: Porapak Q for CO2, C2H4 and C2H6 and MS 5A for H2, O2, N2, CO and CH4. The liquid products were analyzed offline in gas chromatograph (Varian 3300) equipped with FID using an HP-FFAP column. The experiments were performed in a temperature range from 550 to 750°C at atmospheric pressure. The duration of the runs in each temperature examined was 1h. A steam to carbon molar ratio of 3 was used for all the experiments. This ratio even though lower than that of the actual aqueous phase of the bio-oil [26] was selected so as the differences in coking affinity observed among the catalysts to be more distinct. The catalyst (0.05g) diluted with quartz particles (0.10g) was placed in the quartz reactor. The inlet flow of the liquid mixture was set at 6 and 4.5cm3/h for acetic acid and acetone reforming, respectively. Helium was used as diluent with a flow of l00cm3/min. The reforming tests were performed at constant space velocities. The gas hourly space velocity GC1HSV (defined as the volume of gas C1-equivalent species in the feed at standard temperature and pressure per unit volume of catalyst per hour) was 34500h−1 for acetic acid and 28500h−1 for acetone. The carbon balance in all experiments was 100%±2%."
5,Model compounds of bio-oil—acetic acid and acetone,"2.4 Model compounds of bio-oil—acetic acid and acetone Two model compounds were used in this study: acetic acid and acetone. Acetic acid is the most representative compound of the bio-oil as its concentration can reach 12% [8]. Acetone is also representative of the ketones present in the oil with concentration up to 2.8% [8]. These oxygenated compounds can form hydrogen according to the overall steam reforming reaction of oxygenates C n H m O k (1) C n H m O k +(2n − k)H2O→ nCO2 +(2n + m/2− k)H2 Thus, the maximum stoichiometric yield of hydrogen can be calculated as (2) (2+ m/2n − k/n)molH2/molC. The maximum stoichiometric yield for acetic acid and acetone is 2 and 2.67molH2/molC, respectively. However, the yield of hydrogen according to thermodynamic and experimental results is always lower than the stoichiometric maximum because of the two main undesirable products, CO and CH4 formed during reforming via reverse water gas shift and methanation reactions. In addition to these, decomposition reactions are always of importance under typical temperatures of the reformer as bio-oil components are in general thermally unstable [14,36,37]. As a result, thermal decomposition (cracking) for most oxygenates can occur forming a mixture of gases and coke as described in the following reaction: (3) C n H m O k →C x H y O z +gas (H2, CO, CO2, CH4…)+coke The terms conversion, and product yield were used to describe the catalytic results in reforming of the two oxygenates. The conversion of the oxygenate (acetic acid or acetone) is defined as the ratio of the moles of carbon converted to products (gaseous and liquids) to the moles of carbon in the feed (4). To affirm the accuracy of the calculations, the conversion was also calculated based on the amount of organic feed remained unconverted in the liquid products (5). The deviation of the two values of conversion was lower than 0.5%. However to avoid misunderstanding, the experimental results (conversion) mentioned below is based on Eq. (4). (4) Conversion % = moles of carbon converted to products moles of carbon in the feed × 100 or (5) Conversion % = ( moles of oxygenated compound ) in − ( moles of oxygenated compound ) out ( moles of oxygenated compound ) in × 100 The product yield is defined as the percentage of the amount of the experimentally produced component to the theoretical one. For the carbon containing products (productc) the maximum theoretical amount is based on the carbon atoms of the reactants (i.e. 1mol of acetic acid or acetone can produce 2 or 3mol of carbon monoxide, respectively). (6) Yield of produc t C % = moles of produc t C theoretical moles of produc t C based on C atoms × 100 Especially, for the definition of hydrogen yield the theoretical amount is the stoichiometric hydrogen produced from the complete steam reforming reaction (2). (7) Yield of hydrogen % = moles of hydrogen produced theoretical moles of hydrogen × 100"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of the supports and the catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of the supports and the catalysts The supports and catalysts prepared and their properties are compiled in Table 1 The X-ray diffractograms of the two supports are presented in Fig. 1a and b. The Ca2Al support (CaO=21.6wt%) consisting of CaO and Al2O3 at a molar ratio 1/2 appears to be a mixture of three crystal phases: CaAl2O4, Al2O3 and CaAl4O7 phase. The presence of more than one phases of Ca and Al can be attributed to the mild conditions (1100°C for 20h) which have been used for the calcination of the support. In general temperatures higher than 1300°C are applied for the formation of monophasic calcium aluminates [38]. The formation of phases with higher Ca/Al ratios is more kinetically favored [39]. This is the case for the support with the composition CaO/Al2O3 =1/2, which exhibits as major crystal phase the one corresponding to molar CaO/Al2O3 =1/1. The SEM images of this sample and the EDX (Fig. 2a) show that there are two different areas which have different morphological and structural properties. The phase which constitutes the core of the particle is consisted mainly of Al2O3, and the external shell with a different porosity and high CaO/Al2O3 ratio. Combination of the XRD and the SEM-EDS results, lead to the conclusion that the two mixed calcium aluminate phases are not uniformly distributed throughout the pellet but are mostly located to the outer layers. Analogous observations have been reported in the literature pointing that porous isolated regions with sizes up to 100μm containing mostly alumina are formed. The higher Ca content at the external part and the surface of the pores was attributed to the slow Ca diffusion through a diffusion barrier consisting of the denser mixed calcium aluminate phases [39]. On the other hand, the support consisting of CaO/Al2O3 with a ratio of 12/7 (rich in CaO) is a monophasic one as the diffractogram (Fig. 1b) shows the presence of the corresponding mixed phase of Ca12Al14O33. The formation of this phase after 20h of heat treatment at 1100°C is due to the fast kinetics of the Ca rich phase formation [38,39]. This is an indication that any metastable phase formed during the calcination process has been fully transformed to the equilibrium stable phase. The SEM images and the EDX analysis (Fig. 2b) of a cut grain show that both component elements Ca and Al are uniformly distributed in the pellet in agreement with the XRD results. Table 1 presents also the crystal phases of the catalysts supported on calcium aluminates. It is observed that there are differences in the crystal phases of the Ca and Al from that of the initial support used. The change in the crystal phase composition of the catalysts supported on the Ca2Al support is due to the hydration during the wet impregnation of the metal and the subsequent conversion of the hydrated forms to the dehydrated ones during calcination. As the support was immersed to the precursor containing aqueous solutions and treated for 1h under agitation, hydration of the calcium aluminate phases could not be avoided [38,39]. Evidence of the hydration is provided by the different crystal phases identified for the final catalysts which had been calcined at 600°C for 4h and at 900°C for 6h. For the Ni catalysts supported on Ca2Al support and prepared by wet impreganation using NiNO3 solutions the changes in the crystal phases (see Table 1) are limited to the inversion of the relative intensities of the two mixed calcium aluminates phases Ca2Al/CaAl>1 and the absence of any alumina reflections. Both the noble metal (Rh and Ir) supported catalysts prepared via wet impregnation using chlorides salts, show strikingly different reflection patterns. Apart from the two CaAl2O4 and CaAl4O7 phases, the reflections of the Ca12Al14O33 are identified, indicating the partial change in the structure of the supports. The differences obtained in the crystal structures of the Ni and noble metal catalysts supported on Ca2Al may be due to the different acidic strength of the precursor solutions. The chlorides solution as more acidic than the nitrates solution can facilitate the hydration of the calcium aluminates. The catalysts supported on the 12Ca7Al support also show differences in their crystal structure after the deposition of the metals (Table 1). Worthy to note that a mixed calcium iridium phase (Ca2IrO4) was identified in the diffractogram of 0.5IrCa2Al sample, confirming the intermediate dissolution of the support to the acidic precursor solution. Almost all the catalysts supported on calcium aluminates exhibit low surface areas mainly due to the supports used. Both supports were prepared via solid state reactions between CaCO3 and γ-Al2O3 under relatively severe calcination conditions, resulting in low surface areas. The intermediate hydration and partial dissolution of calcium aluminate phases followed by heat treatment at 900°C and subsequent formation of the dehydrated phases is also evident from the increase of the surface areas of almost all the final catalysts supported on both supports. It is well postulated in the literature [38] that the mixed phases formed after hydration show increased surface areas compared to those initially formed via solid state reactions. The SEM images supported by the EDS line scan of the catalysts prepared indirectly point to the dispersion of the Ni and noble metals. The densed packed morphology of the Ca2Al support does not allow for the diffusion of the Ni to the bulk as evidenced from the SEM mapping across a planar section of the pellet (Fig. 3a). On the other hand, the open structure of the 12Ca7Al permits the easy diffusion of Ni to the bulk of the pellets as evidenced from the almost uniform distribution of the Ni (see Fig. 3b) and thus the dispersion of Ni with this catalyst is expected to be lower. Calculations of the Ni crystallites sizes based on Scherrer formula provide also indications about differences in metal dispersion. For the 5Ni/Ca2Al sample, the size of Ni crystallites is 35nm while for the 5Ni/12Ca7Al is almost doubled (72nm). Indications of the Rh dispersion are not easily deduced based on the SEM images, due to the low loading 0.5wt% (SEM not shown). The same is also valid for the 0.5Ir/12Ca7Al sample, whereas with the 0.5Ir/2CaAl, iridium seems to be preferentially attached to calcium, forming big crystallites of Ca2IrO4 as evidenced from XRD (Table 1) and SEM images (Fig. 4 ). To check if the type of the metal deposited on Ca2Al support affects the acidity of the final catalyst, ammonia-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD-NH3) experiments were employed. Desorption profiles of ammonia as a function of temperature are presented in Fig. 5 . It is clear that the addition of Ni or Rh metal on the Ca2Al support slightly affects the acidic strength of the support. The same results were also observed with the catalysts supported on 12Ca7Al carrier (not shown). The desorption of ammonia at relatively low temperature, 170°C, indicates the presence of weak acidic sites present in all the catalysts examined. A small peak observed at 360°C in the profiles of the supports is characteristic of acidic sites with higher strength which may arise from the free Al2O3 as identified by XRD (Table 1). However, it is of minor importance as its intensity is very low and it vanishes in the presence of Rh and Ni. With regard to the total number of acidic sites, the addition of the metals does not affect the very low acidity of the support, which is quantified at around 20μmol NH3/g catalyst. Overall, a few weak acid sites are present on the surface of the catalysts supported on calcium aluminates."
8,Thermal reactions in the presence and absence of steam,"3.2 Thermal reactions in the presence and absence of steam As mentioned before, bio-oil components are thermally unstable under reforming conditions. To investigate the extent of thermal reforming and/or decomposition, runs were conducted in the absence of catalyst at the maximum temperature used in this study, 750°C. The reactor was packed with quartz particles of the same weight and particle size as with the catalytic tests. The mixture of the bio-oil component – acetic acid or acetone – with steam at constant S/C ratio of 3 was used as feed. The temperature was kept constant at 750°C for the 3h testing. The results are presented in Table 2 . It is clear that the extent of homogeneous reactions is quite important with conversion in the range of 23% for acetic acid. The product distribution allows us to speculate about the network of the reactions occurring under these conditions. Acetic acid can undergo a series of transformations either purely homogeneous in the gas phase or on the particle surface and the reactor walls. Acetic acid is mainly converted to a mixture of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4. The hydrogen yield, 14%, indicates that acetic acid is partially reformed. The relatively high yield of methane (3.5%) indicates that decarboxylation reaction also takes place while the absence of ethylene from the products implies that CO is not produced via the ketene route but most probably directly from acetic acid [19,22]. Overall, acetic acid forms a mixture of products mainly via parallel decomposition (8), complete reforming (9), decarboxylation (10) and to a lesser extent via ketonization (11) reactions. (8) CH3COOH→2CO+2H2 (9) CH3COOH+2H2O→2CO2 +4H2 (10) CH3COOH→CH4 +CO2. (11) 2CH3COOH→CH3COCH3 +CO2 +H2O Decomposition reactions may also occur in the absence of steam. For that reason separate experiments in which the feed was pure acetic acid were also performed. The results are also included in Table 2. Acetic acid decomposes to a significant extent, around 30% conversion. Hydrogen appears in traces while carbon dioxide and methane are the main products. Their yields approach 15 and 12%, respectively. This indicates that decarboxylation (10) is the main reaction taking place. The higher than 1 ratio of CO2/CH4 ratio implies that part of CO2 is formed via a parallel thermal ketonization reaction (11). The low amount of acetone detected in the reaction products is due to the sequential acetone decomposition at the high reaction temperature applied. The lower conversion of acetic acid in the presence of steam compared to that in the absence of steam (23% vs 30%), can be attributed to the stabilization effect of steam [20] and the lower partial pressure of acetic acid. The degree of acetone conversion in the presence of steam is quite high approaching 65% at 750°C (Table 2). Acetone as more thermally unstable than acetic acid undergoes thermal reactions to higher extent. The distribution of the products between the acetone and acetic acid homogeneous reactions are quite different. The high yields of methane and acetic acid, 31.25 and 10.40%, respectively, indicate that the main route to the products is the decomposition of acetone to ketene (12) and its further hydration to acetic acid (13) [40,41]. Ketene hydration via reaction (14) can contribute also but to a lesser extent to the formation of CH4 and CO2 [40]. The high amounts of carbon monoxide and acetic acid may also arise from the “alternative” reforming of acetone via reaction (15) [42]. (12) CH3COCH3 →CH2CO+CH4 (13) CH2CO+H2O→CH3COOH (14) CH2CO+H2O→CH4 +CO2 (15) CH3COCH3 +2H2O→CH3COOH+CO+3H2. The conversion of acetone in the absence of steam is around 70% (Table 2). CO and CH4 are the main products with 46 and 20% yield, respectively. According to literature [41,43] decomposition of acetone follows reaction (16) producing CO and methyl groups that further react and give methane, ethylene and hydrogen. In addition, acetone further decomposes to ketene and methane via reaction (12) while ketene formed may be converted via reaction (17) to ethylene and CO [41]. Even though in small amounts, ethylene was found in the products stream. (16) CH3COCH3 →CO+CH3 +CH3 (17) 2CH2CO→2CO+C2H4 Steam stabilizes the acetone in the same way as in the case of acetic acid based on the conversions attained. In addition, in the presence of steam the conversion remains stable with time on stream while in the absence of it, acetone conversion decreases from initial values of 70% to 40% during the third hour."
9,Reforming activity of the calcium aluminate support,"3.3 Reforming activity of the calcium aluminate support The contribution of calcium aluminate support (CaO/Al2O3 =1/2) to the steam reforming reaction of acetic acid and acetone was also examined. Fig. 6 shows the conversion and the product yields obtained during the 3h testing at 750°C with S/C=3 for both feeds. A clear decrease of the activity with time on stream is observed for both the organics. The differences observed to the degree of conversion and the product distribution between the two bio-oil components are also evident. The calcium aluminate support itself shows, during the first hour of testing, a conversion of acetic acid around 45%, considerably higher than that in the presence of quartz (see Table 2). The catalytic action of the calcium aluminate is also confirmed by the differences observed in the product distribution. Appreciable amounts of C2 olefins and especially of ethene are formed. The activity of calcium aluminates in steam reforming of bio-oil has also been reported [44]. Carbon dioxide and methane as main products indicate that decarboxylation (10) of acetic acid takes place on the surface of the support along with complete reforming to CO2 and H2 (9). Acetone, ethane and ethylene are mainly produced via ketonization (11) and C2 formation reactions ((18) and (19)). (18) 2CH3COOH→C2H4 +2CO2 +2H2 (19) 2CH3COOH→C2H6 +2CO2 +H2 The performance of the support decays with time on stream most probably because of the deposition of carbon. Indeed the amount of carbon deposited on the support as measured after the 3h testing was 1.8wt%. The presence of ethylene among the products implies that calcium aluminate activates the dehydrogenation reactions which lead to unsaturated products and finally coke. Calcium aluminate is highly active in acetone reforming (Fig. 6). During the first hour of testing the acetone conversion approaches 90%. The activity decreases with time on stream but still remains at high levels around 70% during the third hour. Compared to the “inert” quartz the support suppresses the reactions leading to methane formation (12) and (14) while it favors steam reforming to H2 and CO. The presence of acetic acid in the product mixture is less pronounced compared to that in the case of quartz especially during the first hour of testing while is slightly increased during the third hour when the calcium aluminate is partially deactivated. The amount of coke deposited on the calcium aluminate after 3h testing is 2.16wt% which is higher than the one produced via thermal reactions (see Section 3.7) indicating that part of it is due to catalytic actions."
10,Acetic acid steam reforming over catalysts,"3.4 Acetic acid steam reforming over catalysts 3.4.1 Nickel catalysts Acetic acid reforming tests were performed in the presence of Ni supported on calcium aluminate catalysts at 550, 650 and 750°C using S/C ratio=3. The results obtained with the catalysts containing 5 and 10wt% Ni supported on the two different calcium aluminates are presented in Fig. 7 . The support affects significantly both, the conversion of acetic acid and the product yields. The 5NiCa2Al catalyst is by far more active than the catalyst supported on calcium aluminate with different CaO/Al2O3 ratio, 12/7. Even at low temperature, 550°C, more than 50% of acetic acid is converted with hydrogen yield up to 35%. At higher temperatures, 650 and 750°C, full conversion is attained with hydrogen yield almost 90%, approaching the values of thermodynamic equilibrium [12]. Carbon oxides, CO and CO2, are the main carbon containing products, while in minor amounts methane and acetone are formed. It is important to mention that no deactivation was observed during the 1-h duration of the experiments. The lower activity of the catalyst supported on 12Ca7Al compared to that of Ca2Al in the reforming of methane was attributed to the lower reducibility of Ni2+ which interacted strongly with the Ca12Al14O33 phase as confirmed by the absence of metallic Ni peak in the XPS spectra of 5Ni12Ca7Al catalyst [31,34]. As already mentioned in Section 3.1, SEM images show that indeed Ni particles are incorporated into the bulk of 12Ca7Al support thus decreasing the actual metal surface area. In contrast, with 5NiCa2Al catalyst most of Ni is distributed at the boundaries of the grains facilitating the high degree of dispersion. In addition, the smaller crystallites of nickel over the latter support contribute to the difference in dispersion and consequently to the activity in acetic acid reforming. Increase of Ni loading from 5 to 10wt% (Fig. 7) as expected increase the conversion significantly over both Ni catalysts supported on Ca2Al and 12Ca7Al, as much higher number of accessible metallic sites are present on the catalyst surface. Considering the results obtained from acetic acid reforming in the presence of the inert quartz and the bare support it is clear that the addition of the metal (Ni) is essential for complete acetic acid conversion. Hydrogen and carbon oxides as main products indicate that reforming and water gas shift are the main reactions taking place. Even with the 5Ni/12Ca7Al catalyst, which shows low conversion at 750°C, the main reactions are the reforming and the water gas shift. The production of acetone at low temperatures 550°C reveals that ketonization (11) reaction also proceeds but to a minor extent. Traces of methane detected may arise from the decarboxylation (10) reaction. 3.4.2 Noble metal catalysts Noble metals (Rh and Ir) supported on Ca2Al catalysts were also tested for their performance in reforming of acetic acid. The conversion obtained (Fig. 8 ) is lower compared to that of Ni catalysts under the same reaction conditions. This can be attributed to the much lower loading used with noble metal catalysts. Concerning the products distribution, substantial differences are also observed. The extent of ketonization reaction (11) especially with Rh catalyst is quite high at temperatures ≤650°C. The high activity of noble metals in ketonization reaction has also been mentioned in the literature [19]. At 650°C up to 45% acetone yield is achieved demonstrating that ketonization reaction prevail along with reforming and water gas shift reactions. The high yield of acetone inevitably leads to low hydrogen selectivity and hence yield as shown in Fig. 8. Hydrogen yield remain at very low levels even at 650°C. Only, at 750°C the yield approaches 80%. Iridium shows quite low activity to acetic acid reforming compared to Rh catalysts in agreement with data from literature [45,46]. The much lower conversion of acetic acid over the 0.5Ir/2CaAl catalyst compared to that over 0.5Ir/12Ca7Al may be due to the significantly lower dispersion of Ir over the former catalyst as evidenced by the presence of large Ca2IrO4 crystallites detected in XRD (Table 1) and SEM (Fig. 4). For the Rh catalyst the effect of the support type (Ca/Al ratio) on the activity is not so pronounced as with Ni catalysts. Present results do not allow us to draw certain conclusions about the different interaction of the Rh with the two supports."
11,Coke deposition during acetic acid reforming,"3.5 Coke deposition during acetic acid reforming Carbon deposition is one of the major drawbacks for the successful realization of bio-oil reforming. For this reason the coke production rate of the catalysts was studied in a separate series of experiments conducted at constant temperature of 750°C for 3h time on stream. The used catalysts were transferred to stoichiometric CHN analyzer for the measurement of deposited carbon. The results of coke together with the conversion of acetic acid attained are compiled in Table 3 . The amount of coke deposited is expressed as (i) wt% coke on catalyst defined as the percentage of the amount of coke produced after 3h time on stream divided by the amount of the catalyst used and (ii) as the percentage of the moles of C in the feedstock that are converted to coke. Nickel loading affects not only the conversion of the oxygenate but the amount of coke produced as well. The catalyst with the maximum nickel loading used in this study, 10wt%Ni, shows the highest amount of coke deposited on its surface (15wt%) after 3h TOS at 750°C. Decreasing the amount of the active metal to 5wt% leads to drastic decrease in coke deposits which nevertheless remain at relatively high levels. The type of support affects also the resistant to coking. The catalyst supported on the mixed calcium aluminate CaO/Al2O3 =1/2 shows reduced affinity to coking compared to that on calcium aluminate CaO/Al2O3 =12/7 in agreement with previous studies in methane dry reforming [34]. Noble metal containing catalysts, exhibit much lower carbon deposition over both supports. As the acidity of the Ni and Rh supported catalysts was found almost similar (see Section 3.1), the much lower coking rate over the Rh catalysts should be entirely attributed to nature of the metal. Besides, the lower affinity for carbon formation of noble metal catalysts is well known in literature [45]. It is to be noted that even though the results as presented (wt% on catalyst) are not very encouraging, nevertheless coke presented as the percentage of C fed to the reactor that is converted to solid carbon is very low even in the presence of the less resistant to coke 10Ni/Ca2Al catalyst. The 10Ni/Ca2Al sample which shows the maximum coke, 15wt% on catalyst deposited after 3h TOS, presents an average value of coke formation rate of 0.28% molcoke/molC fed to the reactor. Almost an order of magnitude lower coke formation rate is observed with 0.5Rh/Ca2Al catalyst not surpassing 0.03%. Even though not directly comparable, literature data on coke formation rates in the presence of promising catalysts are in the same order [20]. Coke formed under steam reforming conditions arises from thermal and catalytic routes as well. In the presence of inert quartz a relatively small amount of coke 0.96wt% based on quartz was observed under thermal steam reforming conditions (Table 3), demonstrating that acetic acid is thermally decomposed to coke to a limited extent. In the absence of steam acetic acid is decomposed to carbonaneous species to a higher degree (1.44wt% coke based on quartz). The higher amounts of coke formed over all tested catalysts imply that catalytic routes related to reforming reactions also contribute to the deposition of solid carbon to an extent that depends on the type and loading of the metal and the specific characteristics of the support."
12,Acetone steam reforming over catalysts,"3.6 Acetone steam reforming over catalysts Acetone reforming was conducted under the same experimental conditions as with acetic acid, over the best performing catalysts—Ni and Rh supported on CaO·2A12O3. Fig. 9 illustrates the activity of the catalysts and the product distribution. As with acetic acid, acetone reforms primarily to a mixture of H2, CO2 and CO and to a much lesser extent to CH4. In addition to these products, very low amounts, not surpassing 0.1% of acetic acid is formed. As presented in Section 3.2, acetone in the presence of steam can form substantial amounts of acetic acid via the following two routes: directly from acetone via the “alternative” reforming reaction (15) and indirectly via the ketene formation ((12) and (13)). However, over the highly active Ni and Rh catalysts, these reaction routes either do not proceed or the acetic acid formed is sequentially fully reformed. The performance of Ni and Rh catalysts is pretty much the same, as over both catalysts the conversion of acetone increases from 25% at 550°C to 100% at 750°C. The ratio of CO2/CO at the maximum temperature used is 1.73 and 1.14 for Nickel and Rhodium catalysts, respectively which are close to that predicted from WGS equilibrium. With Rh catalyst the hydrogen yield 82%, at 750°C, approaches that predicted from equilibrium calculations [12], while with Ni catalyst hydrogen yield remains at lower level. The lower hydrogen yield is attributed to increased methane production as clearly shown in Fig. 9. Methane is probably formed together with ketene via the decomposition reactions of acetone ((12) and (14)). The results suggest that it is more likely that Ni favors the decomposition reaction of acetone to ketene and methane. In general, under the same conditions (S/C, temperature and W/F) both the acetic acid and acetone show almost the same reactivity in steam reforming over the 5Ni/Ca2Al and 0.5Rh/Ni2Al catalysts."
13,Coke deposition during acetone steam reforming,"3.7 Coke deposition during acetone steam reforming The amount of carbon deposited after 3h testing under acetone reforming conditions, on the surface of the Ni and Rh catalysts, was also measured (Table 4 ). Coke deposits as measured after thermal reforming and decomposition of acetone are also tabulated. Unexpectedly, both Ni and Rh catalysts show almost the same tendency to form coke which amounts to ca 1.40wt% on catalyst or 0.03% moles C/mol of C fed into the reactor. As with acetic acid, acetone also undergoes thermal reactions in the presence or even in the absence of steam which lead to the formation of solid carbon. The bare support which shows a remarkable activity in reforming of acetone (initial conversion 90%, see Fig. 6)) contributes to a significant degree to coke formation (2.16wt%). However, as the surface of the support is modified by the presence of the active metals and the high reforming activity prevails that of the support induced reactions, the formation of solid carbon is slightly limited. It is speculated that the major part of carbon deposits over the Ni and Rh catalysts might arise from the reactions of acetone on the support resulting in the same coke deposition rate. Further work is in progress for the complete characterization of the nature and the location of the coke deposits over the Ni and Rh catalysts."
14,Conclusions,"Steam reforming of bio-oil and its fractions is one the most promising routes for hydrogen production. Model compounds of bio-oil such as acetic acid and acetone has been selected as representative components according to their concentration in the complex mixture for testing them separately in steam reforming reaction in the absence of catalysts (thermal) and in the presence of active catalytic materials. The main conclusions of this work are as follows: - Both acetic acid and especially acetone, at 750°C and very high space velocities, are thermally steam reformed and decomposed to a mixture of carbon containing products COx and CH4 and low amounts of hydrogen. Acetone can form substantial amounts of acetic acid in the presence of steam as the latter seems to promote the alternative reforming (oxidation) of acetone to acetic acid. The amount of coke formed via homogeneous reactions is quite low for the two oxygenates. Ni (5wt%) and noble metal catalysts (0.5wt% Rh and Ir) supported on calcium aluminate supports with different Ca/Al ratios (1/2 and 12/7) showed high activity in steam reforming of acetic acid. The performance of Ni catalysts supported on 12CaO·7Al2O3 was lower than that supported on CaO·2Al2O3 due to the increased surface dispersion of Ni on the latter support. Ni/CaO·2Al2O3 catalyst exhibited high hydrogen yield approaching equilibrium values in the temperature range of 650–750°C. Rh catalyst was also active but at higher than Ni temperatures most probably because of the much lower metal loading. The resistance to coking depends also on the type, loading of metal and the type of support. Under the conditions used in this study all catalysts presented low coke tendency expressed as moles C/mol of C fed into the reactor). Rh catalyst supported on CaO·2Al2O3 showed the lowest deposition rate. Acetone steam reforming using the best performing catalysts – 5%Ni/CaO·2Al2O3 and 0.5%Rh/CaO·2Al2O3 – showed that both catalysts are equally active in the temperature range examined with the Rh catalyst showing slightly higher hydrogen yield. The similarity in their performance might be attributed to high extent of acetone conversion mostly on the support especially at the highest temperature used. Coke deposits over both catalytic materials were very low and almost in the same range confirming the high extent of thermal steam reactions."
