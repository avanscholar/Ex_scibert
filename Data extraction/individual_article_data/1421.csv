0,Introduction,"Alcohol fuel has been used as a petroleum-based fuel additive for several decades. It has enormous potential for energy independence, emissions reduction and resource sustainability. It is a well-established fact that alcohol fuels have a positive effect on the reduction of post-combustion soot emissions in spark-ignition (SI) and compression ignition (CI) engines. Besides, the high latent heat of vaporization and low flame temperatures for alcohol fuels could be a promising way to increase power output and decrease thermal losses. The engine and emission performance for the alcohol fuel blended with conventional petroleum-based fuels has been investigated extensively. Agarwal [1] reviewed a host of literature and concluded that ethanol addition can improve the engine power performance and reduce emissions of CO and unburned hydrocarbons (HC) for SI engine and, in the meantime, make a significant reduction in CO and NOx emission in CI engine. However, the lower energy content of ethanol causes a higher specific fuel consumption, i.e. an undesirable fuel economy. In addition, the problematic miscibility of anhydrous ethanol in diesel, arising from the existence of hydroxyl (OH) moiety yielding a dipole moment in the molecule and thus hindering the solution of alcohol in non-polar hydrocarbon, incurs serious consequences on the engine operation due to phase separation between diesel fuel and ethanol [2]. These drawbacks of ethanol are mitigated as carbons in the alcohol increase. Therefore, n-butanol and higher alcohols blended in diesel fuel attracted widespread research focused on engine combustion. Rakopoulos et al. [3] investigated the engine and emission performance for blends of n-butanol and conventional diesel fuel at blending ratios of 8%/92%, 16%/84% and 24%/76% by volume. The decreasing NOx and CO emissions and increasing HC emission, as well as a slight increase of brake thermal efficiency and lower exhaust gas temperatures were observed as the butanol percentage increased in the blend. Yao et al. [4] discussed the influence of n-butanol addition to diesel on engine performance and emissions with different injection strategies. The results showed a significant reduction in soot and CO emissions with the inclusion of n-butanol in diesel, and the lowest soot emission was reached with the highest n-butanol fraction (15% by volume) in this study for the triple-injection strategy. Yilmaz et al. [5] studied the n-pentanol/diesel blends of 5%, 10%, 20%, 25% and 35% (by volume) n-pentanol in a diesel engine. They observed a decrease in exhaust gas temperature, CO and NOx emissions and an increase in HC emissions with 5% n-pentanol blend. Apart from the above-mentioned researches under engine operation, the influence of n-alcohol on the autoignition of n-alcohol/diesel blends was also studied in a constant-volume combustion chamber. Lapuerta et al. [6] measured the IDTs of ethanol/diesel and n-butanol/diesel blends with different volume fractions of alcohol both from 0 to 100 percent in a constant-volume combustion chamber equipped with a common-rail diesel injector. They found that IDTs increased directly with the increase in alcohol content in diesel. Ma et al. [7] investigated three sets of n-pentanol/diesel blends with the volume ratio of n-pentanol to diesel being 0% (pure diesel), 20% and 40% and measured their IDTs in an optical constant-volume combustion chamber under ambient temperatures from 800 K to 1200 K and different oxygen concentrations of 10%, 15% and 21%. Pure diesel showed the highest reactivity at all oxygen concentrations. At atmospheric circumstances, i.e. 21% oxygen concentration, the reactivity of blends increased with the decrease in n-pentanol content. However, under lower oxygen concentrations of 10% and 15%, the IDTs of blends with 40% n-pentanol turned out to be shorter than those with 20% n-pentanol. This counter-common-sense result was actually a complicated interaction of flow and ignition, the so-called spray ignition process. To better understand universally the formation mechanism of emissions and the effect of alcohol addition to diesel on homogeneous combustion, combustion chemistry studies of alcohols are perceived as an effective way to elucidate the role of fuel-bound oxygen during combustion. Considerable chemical models pertinent to pure alcohols were proposed and validated against corresponding experiments [8]. Besides, the influence of alcohol addition to hydrocarbon fuels was properly studied by either experiment or modeling. Fikri et al. [9] measured the IDTs of a stoichiometric mixture of ethanol (20%) blended with n-heptane (18%) and isooctane (62%) by volume in a high-pressure ST covering temperatures from 690 K to 1200 K and pressures at 10, 30, and 50 bar. Zhang et al. [10] investigated the autoignition of three sets of n-heptane/n-butanol blends (80% / 20%, 50% / 50%, and 20% / 80%) and two neat fuels (n-heptane and n-butanol) under post-reflected-shock conditions covering temperature range of 1200–1500 K, pressures of 2 and 10 atm, and equivalence ratios of 0.5 and 1.0. Huang et al. [11] developed a reduced chemical kinetic mechanism of n-heptane/n-butylbenzene/n-pentanol/ polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) blend to simulate diesel combustion and emissions for engine application. Ma et al. [12] formulated a combined reduced mechanism for the combustion simulation of diesel/biodiesel/alcohol (up to n-pentanol) and simulated 0-D IDTs, 1-D premixed flame speed and 3-D spray combustion flames. These two newly developed reduced mechanisms [11,12] were not, however, validated with IDTs and other combustion properties. Different blends of alcohol and diesel have been studied, as described previously, in a constant-volume combustion chamber, where, however, the ignition process actually contains physical processes—the atomization of liquid fuel jet, the vaporization of fuel droplets, the mixing of fuel vapor with air, etc.—and pure chemical process—the pre-combustion reactions of fuel/air mixture. For this reason, undertaking relevant research in terms of the chemical process itself is quite meaningful and significant. The typical experimental setups for this purpose include ST and rapid compression machine (RCM). However, no report on homogenous combustion of n-alcohol/diesel blends was found in previous studies. The current work presents the IDTs for blends of diesel and n-alcohol (from ethanol to n-pentanol) over extensive temperatures and various pressures by using a heated ST and a heated RCM. In addition, a detailed mechanism was selected to simulate the experimental results. On the whole, the measured data presented here will serve as a useful data set for the community."
1,Experimental approach,
2,Heated ST,"2.1 Heated ST The intermediate-to-high temperature IDTs were measured in the heated ST which has been elaborated in the previous literature [13]. This tube with inner diameter of 90 mm is composed of a 4 m driver section and a 5 m driven section. The inner surface along the stainless-steel tube of the driven section was honed thoroughly to minimize the post-reflected-shock pressure rise due to non-ideal flow. The incident shock wave was yielded by the sudden break of diaphragms between the driver and driven sections. Five piezoelectric pressure transducers spaced axially on the remote 1-m test tube were used to identify the time of incident shock arriving at (also reflected shock departing from) the end wall. The onset of ignition was detected by monitoring electronically excited OH* emission chemiluminescence near 306 nm. The time interval between the reflected shock leaving the end wall and the extrapolation of the maximum slope of OH* emission to the baseline is defined as the IDT, as shown in Fig. 1 . The tailored gas consisting of helium and nitrogen was used as the driver gas to extend the test time when the IDT exceeded 2 ms. The inherent pressure rise due to the non-ideal effect after the passage of reflected shock was also detected in present experiments with a range of (dp/dt)•(1/p0)=0–3%, which would be incorporated in the simulations after conversion to volume profiles."
3,Heated RCM,"2.2 Heated RCM The heated RCM used here is a typical reactor to measure low-to-intermediate temperature IDTs. A more detailed introduction could be found in the published literature [14]. A creviced piston was adopted in the RCM to suppress the roll-up vortex during compression and thus increase the post-compression homogeneity [15,16]. The piston was driven by compressed air into a cylindrical chamber within 30–45 ms. A pressure transducer flush-mounted in the end wall recorded the whole pressure history from pre-compression to post-combustion. A typical pressure history of two-staged ignition is shown in Fig. 2 . The IDT in the RCM is defined as the time from the end of compression (EOC) to the local point of steepest pressure rise. According to this definition, there are two kinds of IDTs for RCM experiments, i.e. the first-stage IDT, which reflects the time difference between EOC and the onset of the first-stage ignition, and the total IDT. In the present experiments, a minimum of four runs under the same initial conditions were conducted and the average-close one was reported. The inert mixture was also subjected to the compression process while maintaining the initial condition, the pressure trace of which can be seen in Fig. 2. The obtained pressure trace was used to interpret the heat loss effect on the IDT when performing kinetic simulations."
4,Mixture preparation,"2.3 Mixture preparation When preparing the reactant mixture, the blended fuel of diesel and n-alcohol (the purity of ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, and n-pentanol is ≧99.5% with water ≦0.005%, 99.7%, 99.8%, and >99.5%, respectively; all supplied by Aladdin®) was injected into the stainless steel fuel tank for both ST and RCM. Afterward, the high-purity (99.999%) N2 and O2 were introduced in sequence. For the RCM, another mixing tank was used to prepare the inert mixture by replacing the O2 with N2. The mixture was magnetically stirred for 1–2 h prior to experiments. On account of the low saturated vapor pressure of diesel components, the experimental apparatus was heated and maintained at a fixed initial temperature (150 °C in this work) to prevent condensation. According to the initial conditions (initial temperature, initial pressure, and mixture composition), the temperature and pressure behind the reflected shock were calculated by the Gaseq software [17]. For the RCM, the compressed temperature (TC ) at the EOC was derived based on the adiabatic core hypothesis: ∫ T 0 T C γ γ − 1 d T T = ln ( p C p 0 ) where T 0, p 0, and p C are initial temperature, initial pressure, and compressed pressure respectively and γ refers to the specific heat ratio of reactant mixture. Wang et al. [18] and Yu et al. [19] both conducted a thorough uncertainty analysis and estimated the uncertainties of ±20% and ±10% for the ST and RCM, respectively."
5,Test conditions,"2.4 Test conditions Alcohol fuels used in this study blend with diesel fuel mainly in the proportion of 20% by volume. According to Agarwal [1], ethanol blended in the diesel fuel up to 20% reduces emissions and can be used in present constant speed CI engines without any hardware modification. The effect of equivalence ratio, pressure, and n-alcohol content on the IDTs of blends was investigated in this work. In addition, two sets of n-alcohol/diesel blends, one having identical cetane number (CN) and the other having identical oxygen content (mass fraction, w%), were studied under the same condition of 20% n-alcohol/80% diesel blend. The diesel fuel used in this work conforms to the China-VI standard and has a CN of 52 [20]. The CN of four n-alcohols, according to Abou-Rachid [21], was graded as 11 for ethanol, 12 for n-propanol, 17 for n-butanol, and 20 for n-pentanol. The volume fraction of each n-alcohol was determined based on the CN (43) and oxygen content (6.65%) of 20% ethanol/80% diesel blend. IDTs of all blends were measured under N2-diluted condition. In the present study, the initial temperature of the reactive mixture remains unchanged during the whole experiment for a fixed fuel/air mixture. The desired compressed temperature is obtained only through adjustment of compression ratio. To keep the compressed pressure in the vicinity of the desired pressure, the initial pressure has to be changed concurrently in the opposite direction against the variation of compression ratio when performing the next experiment. The test conditions are listed in Table 1 . All experimental data are supplied in the Supplementary Material."
6,Modeling method,"To simulate the IDTs of blends containing diesel fuel, a proper diesel surrogate must be determined. Qian et al. [22] proposed three sets of diesel surrogates: a three-component surrogate, a five-component surrogate, and a seven-component surrogate. Yu et al. [19] studied the ignition and oxidation characteristics of the three-component surrogate and found that the three-component surrogate has reasonable accuracy in predicting the experimental results. Therefore, the three-component surrogate, composed of 41.3% n-hexadecane, 36.8% isocetane, and 21.9% 1-methylnaphthalene by mole, was chosen to represent diesel fuel in the kinetic model. A recently released detailed mechanism [23–25] containing 492 species and 17,790 reactions from the CRECK modeling group was adopted to simulate the n-alcohol/diesel blends, considering the availability of all n-alcohols and diesel surrogate components investigated in the present work. The OpenSMOKE++ framework [26] developed by the CRECK Modeling Lab was chosen to conduct numerical simulations of reacting systems. It can handle modeling of but is not limited to ST and RCM. In addition, it provides necessary numerical tools for the sensitivity and rate of production analyses. Compared to the Chemkin-Propackage [27], it occupies lesser computer resources and can handle several modeling cases simultaneously while maintaining the calculation speed. Another reason for the substitution of OpenSMOKE++ is the limitation of Chemkin-Pro-in handling a maximum of six reactants and products in one elementary reaction. Therefore, the Chemkin-Propackage is not suitable for the mechanism selected in the current study. Figure S1 compares the performance of OpenSMOKE++ framework and Chemkin-Propackage in simulating IDTs under the same condition. The mechanism used for modeling comparison is an earlier version of current mechanism [28] but without n-pentanol sub-mechanism. It can be seen that both numerical tools are consistent in modeling results under identical conditions. As mentioned above, ST and RCM both depict non-idealities that would shorten the ST IDT due to post-reflect-shock pressure rise and, generally, prolong the RCM IDT due to heat loss during and after the compression of the piston. The pressure rise of 3% in the ST and the pressure history of the inert mixture in the RCM were both converted to volume profiles which were then incorporated into the CONV model to accommodate the non-ideal factors. This method is referred to as the VPRO model [29]. Both latest-version and old-version mechanisms as well as all derived RCM volume profiles are supplied in the Supplementary Material."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Effects of pressure and equivalence ratio on IDTs,"4.1 Effects of pressure and equivalence ratio on IDTs Fig. 3 shows the IDTs measured at different pressures along with CONV and VPRO simulations. Both the first-stage IDTs and total IDTs are presented for the RCM experiment. It can be seen that the IDTs demonstrate a monotonic decrease with increasing pressure over the entire temperature range, including the first-stage IDTs. In general, the HT modeling results depict relatively good agreement with experiments when the VPRO model is employed. With a gradual decrease in temperature, early onset of the negative-temperature-coefficient (NTC) region is observed in simulation, leading to noticeable discrepancies between experiments and simulations. However, as the temperature further decreases to the low-temperature (LT) region, the simulations regain their agreement with experiments. If focusing more on the NTC region, the disagreement of simulations with experiments can be found much serious at higher pressure of 15 bar. Fig. 4 compares the IDTs of 20% n-butanol/80% diesel blend for different equivalence ratios at 15 bar. At intermediate-to-high-temperature, the simulations depict a good agreement with the experimental data. As observed previously, the early onset of the NTC region is also noticeable under these simulation conditions. Besides, the experiments and simulations for three equivalence ratios at 15 bar in the NTC region show marked differences to a similar extent, which means that discrepancy originates from the predictive inability of the current mechanism at higher pressures. In the LT region, as the equivalence ratio increases from 1 to 2, the modeling results exhibit significant deviation from experimental data. Noting that in the current work the increase in equivalence ratio correlates with the reduction in oxygen concentration while maintaining the fuel concentration, the IDTs decrease with an increase in the equivalence ratio. Interestingly, the divergence of IDTs occurs at elevated temperatures. This phenomenon is rooted in the competition of H-atom abstraction from fuel molecule and high-temperature branching reaction. A high equivalence ratio means low oxygen concentration, thus resulting in a relatively slower rate of ignition-promoting reaction H + O2 OH+O in the HT region. Therefore, for the mixtures at a higher equivalence ratio of φ=2, the difference of IDTs with those at lower equivalence ratios will become pronounced if the temperature keeps increasing. That is to say, three lines would diverge from each other."
9,Effect of alcohol component on IDTs,"4.2 Effect of alcohol component on IDTs The effects of alcohol components on IDTs are displayed in Fig. 5 . Figure 5(a) compares the predictive ability of two detailed mechanisms in different versions. The old-version mechanism [28] has been validated extensively, but one prominent flaw of this mechanism is the inability to properly predict the ST IDTs at intermediate-to-high temperatures [18,30,31], which can be observed in Fig. 5(a). However, this discrepancy between experiments and simulations has been narrowed down with the latest-version mechanism. Figure 5(b) shows the IDTs of four sets of n-alcohol/diesel blends measured in ST along with the simulated IDTs. It shows that different n-alcohols blended in diesel fuel cannot be distinguished when igniting under high temperatures. Generally, the ignition of the fuel molecule is highly dependent on the molecular structure. This structure-relevant dependency, however, shows relatively less importance when igniting at high temperatures. For those molecules with similar structures but different carbon chain lengths, the high temperature would break them down into several similar or smaller radicals whose reaction rates are mainly controlled by the temperature, thus showing minor variations in the IDTs. In the NTC region, the diversity of molecule length and configuration exerts a strong influence on the autoignition of fuel molecules due to the occurrence of LT reactions. For the linear n-alcohol molecule, the OH moiety bonded to the carbon skeleton weakens the C–H bond connected to the α-C to the point of making C–H the weakest bond in the molecule [32]. This leads to an easy breaking of this bond, resulting in the H-abstraction at α-C being a major pathway in the LT region. Then, the addition of O2 to α-hydroxyalkyl radical (α-ROH) would directly form an aldehyde and HO2 rather than undergoing conventional LT chain branching pathways as alkanes [33]. This inhibition of reactivity could be compensated to some extent by the increase of carbon chain length because the stabilization of hydroxyalkyl peroxy radicals (R(OH)OO) and subsequent isomerization and decomposition reactions, i.e. the LT chain branching sequence, are favored at the remote carbon site away from the OH moiety. Therefore, the reactivity of n-alcohol/diesel blends increases as the n-alcohol blended in the diesel varies from ethanol to n-pentanol, as the experimental data show in Fig. 5(c). In fact, the difference in reactivity at high temperatures would become relatively prominent for the fuels with different molecular structures. Apart from four diesel/n-alcohol blends, simulations of neat diesel fuel are presented in Fig. 5(b) and (c). It can be seen that in terms of simulations, diesel ignites fastest in the LT region whereas slowest in the HT region. Due to the low reactivity of n-alcohol in the LT region, as discussed above, its addition to diesel would absolutely decrease the LT reactivity of diesel fuel. However, α-H abstraction from the weak α-C–H bond of n-alcohols at high temperatures would facilitate subsequent β-scission leading to faster fuel decomposition than alkanes. Therefore, diesel/n-alcohol blends display overall higher reactivity than diesel fuel at temperatures over 1000 K. If the temperature falls below 700 K, all reaction systems of n-alcohol/diesel blends step into the region purely dominated by LT reactivity. As described above, for the n-alcohol with no less than 4 carbons, there exists a high probability of hydroxyalkyl peroxy (R(OH)OO) radicals isomerizing to hydroxyalkyl hydroperoxyl radicals (Q(OH)OOH) via a favorable six-member transition ring formed between α-C and γ-C after the H abstraction from γ-C of n-alcohol and subsequent O2 addition to γ-ROH. For n-propanol, the γ-C is actually a primary carbon, where the H abstraction by small radicals progressesslowly than that on a secondary carbon [34], so the n-propanol/diesel blend presents a less effective LT chain branching pathway, leading to an overall lower reactivity. This difference in reactivity between n-propanol and higher n-alcohols is captured via the appearance of a stronger IDT decrease from n-propanol/diesel blend to n-butanol/diesel blend as compared to the relatively weaker decrease from ethanol/diesel blend to n-propanol/diesel blend as well as from n-butanol/diesel blend to n-propanol/diesel blend, as shown in Fig. 5(c). Another unusual but interesting behavior of n-alcohol/diesel blends in the LT region is the intersection of IDTs between ethanol/diesel blend and n-propanol/diesel blend, as marked in Fig. 5(c). To interpret this unusual reactivity order for the blends, the participation of diesel fuel in the autoignition ought to be properly considered. Zhang et al. [10] discussed that n-butanol acted as a scavenger for OH radical which would play a vital role in the LT hydrogen atom abstraction pathway of n-heptane, thus rendering the reactivity of n-butanol/n-heptane blends lower than pure n-heptane. In the current cases of n-alcohol differing in n-alcohol/diesel blends, the behavior of IDTs could be a consequence of the divergence in OH radical consumption. Ethanol has only two kinds of a hydrogen atom, α-H and β-H, while n-propanol has α-H, β-H and γ-H attached to the carbon chain. The β-H in ethanol is primary hydrogen, but that in n-propanol is secondary hydrogen. Although the C–H bond at the n-propanol β-C is slightly stronger than the usual secondary n-alkane C–H bond due to the OH moiety, its bond dissociation energy is still lower than that of ethanol β-C. Therefore, when reacting at similar low temperatures, n-propanol is prone to consume more OH radicals, which are predominantly produced from the LT chain branching reactions of hydrocarbons in diesel for the H abstraction compared to ethanol, eventually resulting in a tendency toward lower reactivity. It should be noted that this ignition-delay-time-intersection behavior only reflects an inclination of change in reactivity of the blends, rather than representing an absolute comparison of IDTs between them. This LT reactivity increase of ethanol/diesel blend can also be embodied by the first-stage IDTs shown in Fig. 5(d). In reality, for the autoignition in the LT region, blends are subjected to LT reactions before the first-stage ignition and then the reactivity of reactants is suppressed until the occurrence of hot ignition during which the accumulated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) rapidly decomposes into two OH radicals at around 1050 K [35]. The temperature deeply affects the reaction rate for the first-stage ignition whereas the time afterward until the hot ignition share minor variances for different low temperatures, as shown by the measured pressure traces for stoichiometric n-propanol/diesel blend at 10 bar in Fig. 6 . For the LT region, the pressure rise after the first-stage ignition appears similar at three temperatures, resulting in a similar second-stage duration afterward. The total IDT in LT region is highly related to the first-stage ignition where the fuel consumption is considered of little variance during the LT reaction process. In the NTC region, the reactant after the EOC undergoes shorter LT reaction duration, and the pressure rise after the first-stage ignition gradually decreases until no LT heat release occurs after the EOC, then entering the HT region. The evaluation of the mechanism can be carried out based on the modeling results of IDT presented in Fig. 5(b) and (c). It can be seen that the predicted ignition delays depict an earlier shift from the HT region to the LT region and predicted ignition times in the NTC region are considerably shorter than the experiments. Additionally, when the VPRO model is employed, the mechanism depicts an increase in reactivity as compared to the CONV model for both ST and RCM. This phenomenon is mainly owing to the onset of autoignition during the compression of the piston in RCM [36]. Therefore, if the reactivity of the molecule described by the mechanism is inappropriately high, the early ignition of the mixture during the compression will depict a noticeable discrepancy between VPRO and CONV predictions. Figure 5(d) shows the experiments and simulations of the first-stage IDT measured in RCM. It can be seen that the simulations fail to accurately predict the first-stage IDTs but reactivity order is the same as experiments for different blends."
10,IDTs under identical CN,"4.3 IDTs under identical CN It is well-known that CN is a critical property target for the fuel used in CI engine combustion. Because of the CN gradually increasing from ethanol to n-pentanol, different blends with the same content of alcohol in diesel fuel show different CN. Therefore, equal-CN blends were formulated by adjusting the volume fraction of each alcohol to investigate the autoignition of different n-alcohol/diesel blends with identical CN. The measured and simulated IDTs are shown in Fig. 7 . The differences of ST ignition data among four blends are still imperceptible and the RCM IDTs of different blends have the same reactivity order from ethanol/diesel to n-pentanol/diesel as the blend sets shown in Fig. 5(c). Still, the LT IDTs of ethanol/diesel blend intersect with those of n-propanol/diesel blend and, furthermore, have a tendency to cross those of n-butanol/diesel blend. The approach of IDTs of n-butanol/diesel blend to n-propanol/diesel is undoubtedly the consequence of the increase in n-butanol content from 20% to 23.5% in the n-butanol/diesel blend. As discussed previously, n-alcohol shows lower LT reactivity than n-alkane with the same carbon chain length because the addition of O2 to α-ROH radical directly forming an aldehyde and HO2 is a chain termination pathway, thus essentially inhibiting the LT ignition of n-alcohol. Additionally, after O2 adds to β-ROH, the derived β-R(OH)OO radical almost exclusively reacts via the Waddington type reaction [37] to form a β-alkylhydroperoxide alkoxy (β-R(O)OOH) which would undergo a rapid decomposition to two aldehydes and one OH radical [38]. These chain propagating reactions compete directly with the LT chain branching pathways and therefore inhibit the whole reactivity. In summary, the existence of OH moiety decelerates the LT reactions of n-alcohol and consequently the IDTs of n-alcohol/diesel blends increase as the content of n-alcohol in blends gradually increases. This decrease in reactivity of n-butanol/diesel blend is also captured by the first-stage IDTs displayed in Fig. 7(d), which means that the total IDTs in LT region are closely connected with the first-stage IDTs, as discussed in Section 4.2. It is noteworthy that the IDTs of different n-alcohol/diesel blends with the same CN in the LT and NTC region still have discrepancies whereas, according to Westbrook et al. [34], the IDTs for fuel at engine-relevant conditions tend to correlate well with its octane number. The experimental results here show a complicated behavior. In fact, the CN test is run at specified conditions with a standardized engine. For different test fuels, the compression ratio of engine is varied until combustion starts at the top center. Obviously, if the droplet breakup and atomization after spray injection are negatively affected, the test fuel's propensity for autoignition in chemical terminology must increase to meet the same CN requirements. Shin et al. [39] investigated the effect of several physical properties of fuel on spray characteristics and found that the atomization process would be hindered for fuel with an increase in density and viscosity. From the properties of different alcohols tabulated by Kumar et el. [40], it can be found that both density and viscosity increase with the carbon chain increasing from ethanol to n-pentanol. Therefore, it is reasonable that the homogeneous IDTs are different for four diesel/alcohol blends with the same CN and are ranked in the sequence presented in Fig. 7. However, additional work is needed to accurately clarify the relationship between CN and IDTs. Simulations were performed based on the VPRO and CONV models with, more or less, identical conclusions as reached in the previous sections."
11,IDTs under identical oxygen content,"4.4 IDTs under identical oxygen content Due to the existence of OH moiety, n-alcohols and n-alkanes of the same carbon chain length are destined to be different in properties. For example, the lower heat value (LHV) of n-alkanes is higher than that of n-alcohol fuels. The extent of the energy content loss, however, decreases with the increase in the carbon chain length of n-alcohols, for the oxygen content (w%) gradually decreases and, meanwhile, the carbon and hydrogen content increases. In addition, the oxygen content in fuels makes it possible to reduce the smoke and NOx and fuel economy penalties when cooperating with the optimized engine operating conditions like retarding injection timing and increasing EGR ratio [41]. Therefore, another set of n-alcohol/diesel blends with the same oxygen content was established to study their autoignition characteristics. Fig. 8 presents the IDT experiments and modeling results of four n-alcohol/diesel blends. The indistinguishability of HT ignition data for different blends is also observed and the reactivity of blends in the NTC region still presents the same order as previous sets of blends, namely increasing from ethanol/diesel blend to n-pentanol/diesel blend, as shown in Fig. 8(b) and (c). An overlap of ignition data between ethanol/diesel and other blends also exists as a prominent characteristic, and with the content of n-alcohol in other blends increasing further compared to the equal-CN blend set, the ethanol/diesel blend at the lowest experimental temperature depicts the highest reactivity among the four blends. This behavior actually emphasizes the conclusion made in Section 4.2 that the intersection of ignition data represents a tendency toward reactivity alteration rather than an absolute comparison between different n-alcohol/diesel blends. As shown in Fig. 5(c), although 20% ethanol/80% diesel blend is more reactive than 20% n-propanol/ 80% diesel blend at low temperatures, it still reacts slower than n-butanol/diesel and n-pentanol/diesel blends with the same volume fraction of n-alcohol. This reactivity order, however, is reorganized in the current case because it is the content of n-alcohol to dominate the LT reactivity of blends. Furthermore, even if the increments of n-alcohol content among three sets of blends gradually increase from n-propanol (20%–20.5%–25.6%), n-butanol (20%–23.5%–31.4%) to n-pentanol (20%–25.8%–37.2%), the IDTs in the intermediate-to-high-temperature region depict identical order as that in Fig. 5(c). A similar modeling approach is employed as in previous sections with somewhat identical behavior of mechanism observed in predicting the experimental data. Although the kinetic model underpredicts the reactivity of blends, as shown in Fig. 8(d),the order of first-stage IDTs for four blends is properly reproduced by the chosen mechanism."
12,Kinetic analyses,
13,Sensitivity analyses,"5.1 Sensitivity analyses As discussed in the above sections, the detailed mechanism chosen to simulate experiments overpredicts the reactivity of all blends in the intermediate-to-high-temperature region. This discrepancy between experiments and simulations is necessarily due to the inaccurate representation of dominant reactions. Therefore, sensitivity analyses were conducted to understand how the IDT depends on the parameters of various reactions contained in the mechanism. For the cases in the current study, the parameters refer to the pre-exponential A-factors in the Arrhenius reaction-rate expressions and the sensitivity coefficient of a particular reaction is defined as the ratio of the difference in IDTs calculated with a doubled A-factor and the original one to the IDT calculated with the original A-factor, expressed as S i = τ ( 2 k i ) − τ ( k i ) τ ( k i ) where ki denotes the reaction constant of reaction i and τ(2ki ) is the IDT with a doubled rate constant. Based on this definition, the reaction with a positive sensitivity coefficient exhibits the promotive effect on the reactivity while that with a negative one indicates the inhibitive effect. Sensitivity analyses were carried out for four 20% n-alcohol/80% diesel blends at three temperatures of 675 K, 800 K and 1300 K—representing LT, NTC and HT region respectively—to identify the dominant reactions at different temperatures, as shown in Fig. 9 . For clarity, in sensitivity analyses at 675 K and 800 K, corresponding to Fig. 9(a) and (b), only the reactions relevant to n-alcohols are displayed. Additional sensitivity analyses on diesel-related reactions are supplied in the Supplementary Material. The descriptions of certain species denoted by specific names are tabulated in Table 2 . As presented in Fig. 9(a), the highly influential reactions relating to n-alcohols at low temperatures are H abstraction by OH radical from n-alcohol molecules and subsequent oxygen addition steps. For longer carbon chains (C>3), the isomerization of R(OH)OO to form Q(OH)OOH radicals becomes significant. Specifically, the hydrogen bonded to α-C being abstracted by OH radical reduces the reactivity without exception for all n-alcohols (R306, R8648, R7968, and R9832) because the α-ROH easily attracts oxygen at low temperatures and undergoes a rapid decomposition to yield HO2 and aldehydes. This behavior inhibits LT chain branching in two ways: first, it would hamper the LT reaction pathways as those of n-alkanes, and meanwhile, these H-abstraction reactions consume large OH radicals generated from the oxidation of diesel fuel in the blends. By contrast, reaction R9370 forming primary butyl and β-ROH radicals shows a promotive effect on the reactivity. If the abstracted hydrogen is at γ or at a carbon site farther away from OH moiety, the products of H-abstraction and subsequent O2 addition would undergo intramolecular isomerization and then the second O2 addition to accomplish conventional LT chain branching, thus exhibiting a promotive effect on the reactivity, like R4479, R4482, R4447, R4464 and R4462. The dominant reactions in the NTC region are almost identical to those at low temperatures, except for R4481 and R4473. These two reactions show positive sensitivity coefficients at 675 K but negative ones at 800 K. This phenomenon is closely related to the different reaction pathways of Q(OH)OOH radicals. Like O2 addition to α-R radical directly yielding an aldehyde and HO2, an analogous reaction occurs for O2 addition to α-Q(OH)OOH generating a carbonyl hydroperoxide and HO2 radical, namely R4481 and R4473 for n-pentanol and n-butanol, respectively [42]. This pathway tends to consume Q(OH)OOH radicals available to undergo the chain branching process, thus inhibiting the reactivity of the whole system. However, when reacting in the NTC region, the branching ratios of species introducing LT chain branching pathway encounter considerable reduction, and thus the competition between consumption pathways of Q(OH)OOH radicals (R4481 vs. R4482, R4464 vs. R4473) become less intense. Besides, the formed carbonyl hydroperoxides from R4481 and R4473 (NC4-OQOOH for n-butanol and NC5-OQOOH for n-pentanol) could decompose to OH radicals. Hence such reactions are favorable in promoting reactivity when the temperature is in the NTC region. Figure 9(c) shows reactions controlling HT reactivity of the system. In contrast to those at LT and NTC region, the dominant reactions at high temperatures concern small radicals rather than fuel-relevant radicals. In the HT region, large molecules undergo rapid thermal decomposition (i.e. β-scission reactions) prior to the onset of ignition to form active small radicals which eventually control the HT reactivity. This is responsible for practically indiscernible differences in IDTs as shown in previous sections. It is noteworthy that among those small radicals, HO2 takes an active part in both promotive and inhibitive reactions. The reaction of HO2 radical with other radical yields reactive OH radical, like R75, or H2O2 molecule which leads to chain branching via its decomposition to two OH radicals, like R125. Similarly, the reaction generating HO2, R22, tends to promote the system reactivity. However, two HO2 radicals reacting to form one H2O2 molecule (R20) has a positive sensitivity coefficient because this reaction wastes one HO2 radical on the production of H2O2 compared to R125."
14,Preliminary mechanism tune-up,"5.2 Preliminary mechanism tune-up As presented above, the comparison between predictions and experiments indicates a considerable discrepancy in the low-to-intermediate-temperature region as well as an early transition of modeling IDTs from ST to RCM region. The overprediction of reactivity at relatively high temperatures of RCM test conditions would incur serious preignition during the compression process when simulating with the chosen mechanism, thus further sabotaging the reliability and accuracy of predictions. To improve the predictive ability, the mechanism needs to be properly refined. However, it is not scientifically rigorous to modify a mechanism without precise research on certain species. This work presented a preliminary tune-up of the mechanism to highlight the possible directions of mechanism refinement. From the sensitivity analyses on diesel fuel molecules shown in Fig. S2, it can be seen that the reactions with inhibitive or promotive effects are almost the same in both LT and NTC region; only the importance of each reaction varies at different temperatures. At a low temperature of 675 K, due to the dominance of LT chain branching, the first step that generates alkyl radical (R, i.e. NC16H33 in the current case) in the reaction sequence shows a noticeable promotive effect on the reactivity; meanwhile, the dissociation of alkylperoxy radical (ROO, i.e. hexadecylperoxy NC16H33-OO in the current case) to form HO2 and an alkene becomes the most inhibitive reaction because it precludes the subsequent chain branching from the very beginning. By contrast, reactions related to the evolution of hydroperoxyalkyl radical (QOOH, i.e. NC16-QOOH in the current case) show less significant influence on the IDTs. However, with the onset of the NTC region where less ROO radicals succeed in participating in the subsequent LT chain branching pathway, those reactions that approach the accomplishment of chain branching, like the O2 addition to QOOH and subsequent dissociation to generate OH radicals and ketohydroperoxide, present a rather promotive effect while those proceeding oppositely show the most inhibitive effect on the autoignition. According to the aforementioned sensitivity analyses, R7302: NC16-QOOH => HO2 + 1.6NC10H20 has a significant influence on the IDTs in the NTC region while a meager effect in the LT region. Besides, the reaction R7269: NC16H33-OO => HO2 + 1.6NC10H20 plays a major role in the kinetics of NTC behavior either [43]. However, this reaction is not being considered because it equally affects the LT reactivity of fuel. The rate constant of R7302 in the revised mechanism is amended by only altering the pre-exponential A-factor from 1 × 1011 to 3 × 1011 which is same as the old version of CRECK model [28]. Figure 10 depicts the predictability between the current and revised mechanisms. The revised mechanism shows a transition consistent with the experimental data into the low-temperature region. Additionally, the reactivity in the NTC region has decreased leading to better prediction of experimental results. Although the improvements are noticeable for 20% n-butanol/80% diesel blend, the discrepancies in simulated IDTs for 20% ethanol/80% diesel, 20% n-propanol/80% diesel and 20% n-pentanol/80% diesel are significant as compared to the experiments, which might relate to the inaccuracy of corresponding sub-mechanisms of n-alcohols. To study the predictive performance of the current mechanism for only diesel fuel, IDTs measured in the same ST [18] and RCM [20] as this work were plotted together in Fig. 11 . The experiments under identical conditions were selected; only one set of volumetric profiles for RCM modeling was available. The CONV modeling results indicate that compared to the diesel/n-alcohol blends simulations, the intermediate-to-high-temperature IDTs of diesel fuel are better predicted by the current mechanism, though overprediction of reactivity emerges after incorporating volumetric profiles into the simulations (i.e. VPRO modeling approach). This may, to some extent, be proof that the low-to-intermediate-temperature misprediction of the current mechanism mainly results from the limitation of n-alcohol sub-mechanisms. Therefore, further research into the n-alcohol mechanism is imperatively needed. Simulations by using the revised mechanism were also performed, as shown in Fig. 11. The underprediction of RCM IDTs between 800 K and 850 K is alleviated, which indicates the effectiveness of increasing the pre-exponential A-factor of R7302. It should be emphasized that a second thought must be given to optimizing a not-being-extensively-validated mechanism only by focusing on one reaction. There are many other factors that one should consider, like the interaction between reactions and the uncertainty of the modeling method. Our previous work [30] refined several reactions at the same time and thus achieved a relatively satisfactory prediction with the revised mechanism. In addition, Mittal et al. [44] compared the 0-D approach with the CFD modeling method in simulating the RCM IDTs and found that 0-D simulations via the VPRO approach ensure an accurate prediction of first-stage IDTs while overpredict the pressure rise in the first-stage ignition, eventually leading to shorter total IDTs. This might be a subtle reason for the inability of the current mechanism to accurately simulate the experiments. Nevertheless, the preliminary mechanism tune-up performed here eventually serves the purpose of providing a possible way to refine the current mechanism."
15,Conclusion,"The present study formulated three sets of n-alcohol (ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, and n-pentanol)/diesel blends and measured their IDTs in a heated ST and a heated RCM over a wide temperature range to compare the autoignition characteristics of four blends while maintaining the alcohol content, the CN or the O2 mass fraction of four blends, corresponding to three different sets of blends. In addition, a recently-released detailed mechanism suitable for diesel surrogates and n-alcohol from ethanol to n-pentanol was used to simulate the experimental ignition data. Due to the existence of predictive inaccuracy of the mechanism, sensitivity analyses at three temperatures of 675 K, 800 K and 1300 K were conducted to investigate the reactions governing the system reactivity and thus devise a suitable methodology to improve kinetic modeling predictions. The study concluded with the following noticeable observations: (1) The IDTs gradually decrease with pressure increasing, while the blend at a higher equivalence ratio shows lower reactivity. (2) The IDTs at high temperatures diverge for mixtures at different equivalence ratios, which is due to the decrease in O2 concentration that, in turn, suppresses the HT chain branching reaction H + O2 OH+O. (3) For 20% n-alcohol/80% diesel blends, the IDTs in the NTC region decrease in ascending order of carbon chain length of n-alcohol, while those measured in ST cannot be distinguished. A similar trend is observed for the blends with the same CN. Due to the content of n-propanol, n-butanol and n-pentanol in the blend set of identical O2 mass fraction increasing more prominently from 20%, the IDTs of the three blends in the NTC region are approaching those of 20% ethanol/80% diesel but still in the same order of reactivity as 20% n-alcohol/80% diesel blends. (4) At low temperatures, the intersection of IDTs of 20% ethanol/80% diesel blend with the other three blends is observed. This behavior originates from the different consumption rates of OH radicals which are majorly produced via the LT chain branching of diesel fuel. For those n-alcohol molecules which expediently undergo H abstraction by OH radical, like n-propanol, n-butanol and n-pentanol, the stock of OH radicals in the system is lower than that in the 20% ethanol/80% diesel blend, thus hindering the reactivity of the whole system. (5) Simulations of the ST part are in relatively good agreement with experiments, except for an earlier transition into the RCM region, unlike the experimental data. The detailed mechanism overpredicts the intermediate-to-high-temperature reactivity of all blends, while regains its predictive ability at low temperatures. (6) According to the sensitivity analyses, the O2 addition to Q(OH)OOH radicals forming carbonyl hydroperoxides and HO2 presents positive sensitivity coefficients at 675 K while negative ones at 800 K for both 20% n-butanol/80% diesel and 20% n-pentanol/80% diesel blends. This is primarily owing to the reaction of O2 addition to Q(OH)OOH radical then proceeding this pathway would partly prevent Q(OH)OOH radical from undergoing conventional LT chain branching pathway at a lower temperature of 675 K but facilitate the conversion from chain termination into chain propagation at the temperature of 800 K in the NTC region. (7) The revised mechanism after a preliminary tune-up mitigates the error between simulated and experimental IDTs especially for 20% n-butanol/80% diesel blend while the other three blends depict relatively noticeable discrepancies."
