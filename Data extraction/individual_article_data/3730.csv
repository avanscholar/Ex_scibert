0,Introduction,"Biomass is a renewable energy resource. Comparing with fossil fuel, biomass for energy production can lead to zero CO2 emission in a very short life cycle period since carbon in the form of CO2 and energy are fixed by photosynthesis during biomass growth [1]. Conversion of biomass to energy is undertaken using two main process technologies: thermo-chemical and bio-chemical/biological. Thermochemical gasification of biomass is likely to be a cost-effective process to produce fuel gas. However, a large portion of biomass wastes is wet biomass containing up to 95% water and this wet biomass causes high drying costs if classical gas-phase gasification process is used [2]. Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) can advantageously avoid high drying costs, and therefore, more attention has been paid to SCWG recently. The earliest report on SCWG of wood is that of Modell [3,4] from MIT in 1978. After that, a large number of experimental investigations for the gasification of biomass model compounds and real biomass in supercritical water (SCW) have been carried out [5–19]. In 2005, Osada et al. identified three temperature regions for SCW gasification as follows [19,20], 1) Region I (500–700 °C supercritical water) biomass decomposes and activated carbon catalyst is used to avoid char formation or alkali catalyst facilitates the water-gas shift reaction. 2) Region II (374–500 °C, supercritical water) biomass hydrolyzes and metal catalysts facilitate gasification. 3) Region III (below 374 °C, sub critical water) biomass hydrolysis is slow and catalysts are required for gas formation. In region II, biomass gasification was operated at supercritical temperatures (374–500 °C), which will produce more hydrogen and less methane [21]. The use of a catalyst can allow low-temperature operation while maintaining useful kinetics. Lower temperature operation allows lower capital costs because of lower pressure operation, requiring less containment structure, and less severe attack on the reactor walls, which allows the use of less costly alloys [20]. There are four types of catalysts, including activated carbon, metal, metal oxide and alkali, used for SCWG in the literature. Metal catalysts, such as noble metal Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh [5,15,22,23] and metal Ni [5,9,10,22–37], were usually used in SCWG. Generally, alkali, such as NaOH, KOH, Na2CO3, K2CO3 and Ca(OH)2, is used as a catalyst or promoter for SCWG [10,11,13,38–40]. Some researcher also used activated charcoal [7,8] and metal oxides as catalysts in SCWG [41]. Nickel has been widely used as catalyst in steam reforming reactions, sub or supercritical water gasification because of its high activity and low cost. Elliot and his coworkers [5] tested the several different forms of nickel catalysts at 623K and 17–23MPa with the batch reactor, and the product of CH4-rich gas was obtained. Minowa [9,10,22] studied the effect of a reduced nickel catalyst with different supports on cellulose decomposition in hot-compressed water. He found that the nickel catalyst catalyzed the steam reforming of aqueous products and the methanation reaction. Osada [24] and Sato [25] investigated on lignin and cellulose gasification in SCW using nickel catalyst with different supports. Vogel's group [26] compared α-alumina supported nickel to Raney nickel. High yields of methane were achieved and nearly tar-free byproduct water, i.e., nearly complete gasification of wood at temperatures from 370° to 420 °C. The Raney-nickel catalyst was clearly more active, and the α-alumina supported catalyst was abandoned. Cortright and coworkers [27] from University of Wisconsin reported that a tin-promoted Raney-nickel catalyst was used for hydrogen production from sugars and alcohols at temperatures near 500K in a single-reactor aqueous-phase reforming process, and the performance of this non-precious metal catalyst compares favorably with that of platinum-based catalysts [28] for production of hydrogen from ethylene glycol, glycerol and sorbitol. Azadia [29] studied the hydrothermal gasification of glucose in the presence of transition metal chelates consisting of nickel(II) acetylacetonate (Ni(acac)2), cobalt(II) acetylacetonate (Co(acac)2), iron(III) acetylacetonate (Fe(acac)3) and Raney-nickel particles It was found that Raney-nickel was a more effective catalyst for glucose gasification compared to homogeneous Ni(acac)2, Co(acac)2, and Fe(acac)3 catalysts. Azadia [30] also used supported and unsupported metal catalysts consisting of Raney-nickel, Raney-cobalt, Raney-copper, carbon-supported ruthenium, and alumina-supported ruthenium for gasification of glucose near-critical water. DiLeo reported on the SCWG of methanol, phenol, guaiacol and glycine using Ni wire as a catalyst [31–33]. These results show that homogeneous, uncatalyzed gasification in supercritical water is slow, but rates are greatly increased by added Ni wire. Youssef [34] conducted gasification and partial oxidation of 0.25 molar glucose solution over different metallic nickel (Ni) loadings on different catalyst supports (θ-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3) in supercritical water. This study showed that approximately the same hydrogen yield can be obtained from the synthesized low nickel alumina loading (18 wt%) catalyst as with the 65 wt% nickel on silica–alumina loading commercial catalyst. Yan [35] investigated on the generation of hydrogen from polyethylene glycol (PEG)-contaminated wastewater by supercritical water gasification (SCWG) with Ni/ZrO2 heterogeneous catalysis. Taylor [36] proposed an approach to produce nickel catalysts supported on 1-D carbon supports for the supercritical water gasification of cellulose. This work is the first time in the literature that Ni-based catalysts have been both synthesized and evaluated under supercritical fluid conditions. Lee [37] also gasified glucose in supercritical water over Ni/activated charcoal. Ni/activated charcoal catalyst showed a good yield of hydrogen, but it was deactivated due to coke deposition especially at low temperatures below 923K and also due to sintering of nickel particles. The catalytic performance of Ni catalyst for SCWG of biomass may strongly be influenced by the nature of support because the support affects dispersion and stability of the metal as well as it may play a catalytic role in the reaction. Alumina-based supports are often used in catalysts because of their mechanical and chemical resistance under reaction conditions [42]. However, the main problem found when using these Ni catalysts is deactivation by sintering and carbon deposition. Some metal oxides, such as CeO2, are known promoters of carbon removal from catalyst surfaces [43]. Also, the hydrogen yield from cellulose gasification in SCW can be improved with addition of CeO2 [44]. In this paper, Ni/γAl2O3 and Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 catalysts were prepared by an impregnation method. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM, BET specific surface area measurements, XRF and TGA. The performance comparison of the two catalysts was conducted by gasification of glucose in supercritical water with an autoclave reactor."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Ni/γAl2O3 and Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 catalysts were prepared by impregnation of a commercial γAl2O3 with aqueous solutions of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Ce(NO3)3·6H2O. Firstly, 100 ml solution was prepared with a mixture of certain amount of nickel nitrate, cerium nitrate and γAl2O3. Ni-loading and Ce-loading in the different catalysts were selected in order to achieve theoretical mass fraction of Ni and Ce to 20% and 5%, respectively. The solution was heated under stirring for about 3 h until water evaporation was finished and then the solid residue was grounded into powders. Subsequently, it was calcined into catalyst precursors in air with a 7 K min−1 ramp from 30 K to 973 K, holding 5 h at 973 K, and then natural cooling to ambient temperature. The precursors were reduced to the catalysts by H2 (50 ml/min) with a 9 K min−1 ramp from 30 K to 923 K, hold 2.5 h at 923 K and then natural cooling to ambient temperature. Catalysts have been placed in airtight containers with drying at 333 K before used."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Elemental analysis was conducted on the Bruker S4 PIONEER X-ray fluorescence spectrum (XRF) using Ru target and 4 kW maximum power. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of catalysts were conducted at 77 K in the Beckman Coulter SA3100 plus instrument. Samples were degassed at 573 K for 60 min, prior to measurements. Surface area was determined using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) methods. X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of the synthesized catalysts were obtained from a PANalytical X'pert MPD Pro diffractometer using Ni-filtered Cu Kα irradiation (wavelength 1.5406 Å). The sample morphologies were observed (before and after the catalytic tests) by a JEOL JSM-6700F field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Thermo-gravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out using a DSC/DTA-TG (NETZSCH STA449C) with air carrier to determine the amount of coke deposited on catalysts."
4,Catalytic testing,"2.3 Catalytic testing Fig. 1 is the schematic diagram of autoclave with 140 mL for catalytic testing [44]. It is designed for the temperature up to 923 K and pressure up to 35MPa. The autoclave is fabricated from 316 L stainless steal. The pressure was monitored by means of pressure transducer (PA23/8465, Keller) and the temperature inside the reactor was monitored by type K thermocouple. The autoclave was heated by 1.2 kW temperature controlled electric furnace and cooled by water. After cooling down to room temperature, the product gas is sampled and measured using a wet test meter. Analysis of the gaseous products is accomplished by use of a Hewlett–Packard model 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with thermal conductivity detectors. The carrier gas is N2 and carrier gas flow rate is 10 ml min−1. A Carbon-2000 capillary column is used, operating at 333 K for 7 min. A standard gas mixture with 6 Kinds of contents used for calibration is bought from and compounded by Beijing AP Beifen Gases Industry Limited Company. Feedstock was prepared with glucose loading of 9.09 wt%. Glucose solution (11 g) and catalyst (0.2 g) mixed together and then added into the reactor. The reaction temperature and pressure of all tests were controlled at 673 ± 3.0 K and 24.5 ± 0.5MPa, respectively. The reactor was heated from ambient temperature to 673 K for 40 min, and hold 20 min at 673 K. The temperature inside the reactor was cooled to below 473 K in 1 min and below 373 K in 2.5 min. The H2 yield was calculated as the moles of hydrogen produced during gasification process, per mass unit of glucose (kg). (1) H2 yield=moles of H2produced/kg of glucose The hydrogen selectivity [28] was given by, (2) %H2 selectivity=(molecules H2 produced/C atoms in gas phase) (1/RR) *100 where RR is the H2/CO2 reforming ratio, which depends on the reactant compound. RR values for glucose is 2. We have analyzed the uncertainty of experimental data, and the results show that the uncertainty of gas yield is less than 2.67%, that of pressure is less than 0.83%, that of temperature is less than 2.29%, and that of hydrogen selectivity is less than 3.42%."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalytic activity,"3.1 Catalytic activity Fig. 2 displays the gas yield of glucose gasification in SCW with different catalysts. The experimental results showed that the product gas is composed of H2, CH4 and CO2, and CO is a trace component of the product gas, which is consistent with the thermodynamic calculation in our previous work [45]. It is shown in Fig. 2 that H2 yield and CH4 yield are 1.3 mol/kg and 0.8 mol/kg without addition of catalyst, respectively. H2 yields of 10.5 mol/kg and 12.7 mol/kg respectively were obtained with addition of Ni/γAl2O3 and Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 catalysts, which increased by more than 7 and 8 times compared to no catalyst addition, and CH4 yields were also increased by 257.5% and 212.5%, respectively. Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 activity was slightly higher than Ni/γAl2O3 by comparison of H2 yield. Fig. 3 shows effects of the catalysts on H2 selectivity. It is can be seen that H2 selectivity of glucose gasification in SCW without catalyst is only 19.2%, and it can increase to 45.2% and 51.8% respectively with addition of Ni/γAl2O3 and Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 catalysts. Thus, the catalysts only greatly improved H2 yields, but also the H2 selectivity. Also, Ce addition in Ni/γAl2O3 can improve H2 selectivity further."
7,XRF,"3.2 XRF Table 1 shows the results from the element analysis of Ni/γAl2O3 and Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 catalysts measured by XRF. It is been that the mass fraction of Ni and Ce in the catalysts is slightly lower than the feed ratio. The possible reason is that the catalysts before tested can not be avoided to absorb the water in the air. Ni/Al, Ni/Ce and Ce/Al values of the catalysts is close to feed ratio, which means that the active ingredient in the catalysts prepared by impregnation is almost no loss."
8,BET,"3.3 BET N2 adsorption/desorption results for Ni/γAl2O3 and Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 . Both materials give typical type II N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms which is characteristic for macroporous (d > 50 nm) and non-porous adsorbents. BET analysis showed that γAl2O3 support had a surface area of 140.0 m2/g, while the surface area of catalysts prepared by impregnation had only a little decrease compared with the support, and the surface area of Ni/γAl2O3 and Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 were still as high as 114.7 m2/g and 104.1 m2/g, respectively. As shown in Table 2 , the surface area of Ni/γAl2O3 and Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 decreased by 42.5% and 32.8% after gasification reaction. Yu [46] reported on the similar loss in surface area of CuO/Al2O3 for phenol oxidation in supercritical water because the catalyst experienced morphological changes during exposure to SCWO conditions. For SCWG, the possible reasons for surface area decrease are as follows, 1) Catalyst sintering maybe takes place in supercritical water gasification of biomass; 2) Solid catalyst is almost impossible to avoid the coking in heterogeneous catalytic reactions using organic compounds as reaction materials."
9,XRD,"3.4 XRD Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of Ni/γAl2O3 precursor, catalyst after H2 reduced, catalyst after used and γAl2O3 support. Ni/γAl2O3 precursor exhibited the characteristic peaks of NiO at 2θ angle of 37°, 43°, 62.5° and 75°. There was no characteristic peaks of Ni(NO3)3 and others except for γAl2O3, which means that Nickel nitrate was totally decomposed at high temperature to be the catalyst precursor. H2 Reduced Ni/γAl2O3 exhibited the characteristic peaks of Ni0 at 2θ angle of 44.6° 52° and 76°, which means most Ni in bulk phase of catalyst precursor was reduced and Ni/γAl2O3 was prepared successfully. XRD patterns in Fig. 5 show that the diffraction peaks is almost unchanged by comparison of H2 reduced catalyst and the catalyst after used. Fig. 6 displays the XRD patterns of Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 precursor, catalyst after H2 reduced and catalyst after used. Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 precursor exhibited not only the characteristic peaks of NiO at 2θ angle of 37°, 43°, 62.5° and 75°, but also the characteristic peak of CeO2 at 2θ angle of 28.6°, 33.1°, 47.4° and 56.3°. H2 Reduced Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 exhibited the characteristic peaks of Ni0 and the characteristic peak of CeO2, which means that Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 was also prepared successfully by impregnation method. It is can be seen from Fig. 6 that compared with characteristic peaks intensity of Ni0 in Ni/γAl2O3 catalyst, that of Ni0 in Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 catalyst decreases because of the addition of Ce, which means that Ce maybe hinder the growth of metallic Ni on the surface of γAl2O3 support. Also, Fig. 6 shows that the diffraction peak intensity of CeO2 in catalyst after used is lower than the H2 reduced catalyst."
10,SEM,"3.5 SEM Fig. 7 shows the SEM images of Ni/γAl2O3 and Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 catalysts before and after gasification reaction. It is can be seen that active phase particles of 20–30 nm diameter dispersed highly on the sponge-like γAl2O3 support with the large size pore (>50 nm, which is in agreement with the result of N2 adsorption/desorption). This catalyst structure can improve mass transfer in the reaction and effective use of catalyst active site, which results in the high catalytic activity. From the SEM images of Ni/γAl2O3 and Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 catalysts before and after used, it can be seen that very small amount of active phase particles can be found in the catalysts after used because of carbon deposition on the catalyst surface covering with the active phase particles. Also, it can be observed that the sponge-like structure of γAl2O3 support has been agglomeration and most large size pores are disappearing, which means that the catalysts were sintered during the gasification reaction. The sintering will also impede the catalyst active site to play a role in hydrogen production by biomass gasification in SCW."
11,TGA,"3.6 TGA Coke deposition on catalyst surface in varying degrees was observed from the catalyst samples after reaction. The amount of coke deposited on catalyst was determined by a thermo-gravimetric analyzer with air as carrier gas. The results in Table 3 show that the weight loss of Ni/γAl2O3 catalyst is 33.3% and that of Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 catalyst is slightly lower 30.3%, which equivalent to the amount of coke deposition is 0.5 g C/g Cat. and 0.433 g C/g Cat., respectively. From the results of catalysts surface area and amount of coke deposition, Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 is better than Ni/γAl2O3 in anti-coke deposition, which shows that Ce can play a role to inhibit the coke deposited on catalyst. Therefore, Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 has a higher hydrogen production activity than Ni/γAl2O3. Fig. 8 displays the results of TG analyses of used catalysts with air as carrier. It can be seen that oxidation peaks of Ni/γAl2O3 at about 859 K and Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 at about 786 K. Oxidation peaks at low temperature can be ascribed to carbon on nickel surfaces [47] whereas the peaks at temperatures higher than 823 K are ascribed to oxidation of coke deposits with different degree of graphitization [48]. As it is observed in Fig. 8, most of the coke deposited on Ni/γAl2O3 was in the form of graphitic coke (859 K) while for Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 catalyst was in the form of filamentous coke (786 K) on nickel surfaces."
12,Conclusion,"Gasification of glucose in SCW was conducted with Ni/γAl2O3 and Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 catalysts synthesized by impregnation method. Compared to no catalyst addition, H2 yields and selectivity of glucose gasification increased sharply with addition of Ni/γAl2O3 and Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 catalysts. Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 activity was slightly higher than Ni/γAl2O3 by comparison of H2 yield and H2 selectivity. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM, BET specific surface area measurements, XRF and TGA, and it was found that carbon deposition on the catalyst surface and catalyst sintering, which was the major reason for catalyst deactivation, occurred like as the other thermochemical reactions using hydrocarbon as reactant. Ni/CeO2-γAl2O3 is better than Ni/γAl2O3 in anti-coke deposition because of Ce addition."
