0,Introduction,"With the world's oil reserves running down and the increasing environmental concerns due to the pollution generated from the burning of fossil fuels, finding a renewable environment-friendly alternative energy source is a major concern and vital need. Hydrogen (H2) is a potential candidate due to its low contamination levels that would significantly help to reduce pollution and the greenhouse effect. When burned as fuel, the only vapour that produces is water, no CO2, as in the case of the other fossil fuels and no other pollutants. Hydrogen is already produced in large scale and used as feedstock in the chemical, petrochemical, electronics, and metallurgical processing industries [1,2]. Nevertheless, only a small fraction is currently used for energy purposes. Storage, transport, and delivery are examples of the most crucial problems to be solved while building up a sustainable energy system based on hydrogen [1]. For its industrial use, hydrogen is normally generated within the facilities where is needed. This strategy can probably be used in many other instances, where there is no great need for massive distribution. However, H2 is not so readily available on Earth, so it needs to be produced from other molecules. It is associated in nature with many different elements such as carbon to form methane and oxygen to form water. Currently, 95% of H2 derives from fossil fuels (natural gas, oil) and biomass. Production processes include the reforming of methane and high-temperature gasification of charcoal [3]. The electrolysis of water can also obtain hydrogen. Still, this method is very far from being economically competitive [4]. Since the ground-breaking work of Fujishima and Honda in 1972 [5], a lot of interest has been devoted to the production of H2 via semiconductor photocatalysis. Heterogeneous photocatalysis has become one of the most auspicious routes for H2 production since it allows the direct use of sunlight to produce this gas from water and from biomass [6–8]. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is still considered the benchmark photocatalyst due to its high activity, chemical stability, nontoxicity, adequate physical properties, and relatively low cost [9,10]. However, it shows some limitations, including the low efficiency under visible light excitation due to its relatively wide bandgap (3.2 eV), low surface area and easy recombination of the electrons and holes. Some strategies for improving the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 are the combination with other semiconductors for Z-scheme photocatalysis, doping with heteroatoms, loading with metals and coupling with carbon materials, among other strategies [11–14]. Coupling TiO2 with carbon nanomaterials, in particular, has been particularly explored to the unique synergies created between the two phases [15–17]. It has been demonstrated that the nanostructured carbon materials may confer enhanced electronic properties to the resulting hybrid materials. Activated carbon [18], carbon nanotubes and nanofibers [19–21], graphene derivatives [22], nanodiamonds [23], and carbon nitride [24] have been combined with TiO2 for applications ranging from water and wastewater treatment, production of solar fuels and chemicals. Specifically carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been combined with TiO2 in several studies, taking advantage of their unique conductive features, which may facilitate charge separation at the CNT/TiO2 interface. Haldorai et al. [25] reported the synthesis of hybrid materials composed by multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and TiO2 via a sol-gel method loaded with Pt nanoparticles. Enhanced H2 production was achieved using a MWCNT/TiO2 composite loaded with 1.5 wt% Pt under visible light irradiation and a mixture of Na2S and Na2SO3 as hole scavenger. Hierarchical MWCNT/Pd@TiO2 hybrids have been successfully used for H2 evolution from ethanol and glycerol aqueous solutions under UV–vis and solar light irradiation [26]. La-modified TiO2/carbon nanotubes nanocomposites with TiO2 in the form of nanorods or nanoparticles have been applied for H2 production under UV–vis radiation using aqueous solutions of different alcohols such as ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol [27]. In a previous work [20], we have found that the presence of CNTs in CNT/TiO2 composites significantly enhanced H2 generation under near-UV to visible light irradiation. In that study, the carbon phase was maintained at 20 wt%, while the CNT/TiO2 synthesis procedure and the type of metal co-catalyst were varied. Herein, we explore the effect of the CNT load in the efficiency of CNT/TiO2 hybrid materials obtained by a one-pot oxidation/hydrothermal synthesis procedure. A study on the production of H2 from aqueous solutions of glycerol and methanol, used as biomass model molecules, is also presented. High-power UV-LEDs were chosen as the radiation source for maximizing H2 production while reducing costs associated with electrical energy."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials and chemicals,"2.1 Materials and chemicals Titanium (IV) oxide powder anatase (99.8% metal basis), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98%), nitric acid (HNO3, 65 wt%) and glycerol (≥99.5%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Methanol (CH4O, ≥ 99.9%) was supplied from Fluka. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were purchased from Shenzhen Nanotech Port Co., Ltd. (purity > 95%, length = 5–15 μm and diameter < 10 nm). Dihydrogen hexachloroplatinate (IV) hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O) was acquired from Alfa Aesar. A direct-Q millipore system was used to obtain ultrapure water."
3,Catalysts synthesis and characterization,"2.2 Catalysts synthesis and characterization The CNTs were firstly purified with a 50 vol% solution of H2SO4 at 120 °C for 3 h under reflux to remove residual catalytic metal precursors. The CNT/TiO2 composites were prepared by a one-pot route combining oxidation and hydrothermal treatment by immersing different contents of CNTs and TiO2 into a 10 M nitric acid solution (Scheme 1 ). This procedure promotes a better dispersion and attachment of TiO2 particles at the surface of CNTs due to the presence of oxygenated groups such as phenols and carboxylic acids at the surface of the carbon nanomaterials [20]. The suspension was then heated to boiling temperature under reflux for 3 h. Then, the suspension containing the oxidized CNT/TiO2 composites was washed continuously with ultrapure water until achieving the pH ~ 6 and dried at 120 °C for 12 h. Platinum (1 wt%) was loaded on the prepared catalysts by incipient wet impregnation and the resulting materials were dried at 110 °C for 12 h. Then, the catalysts were thermally treated under N2 flow for 1 h, and reduced under H2 for 3 h at 200 °C. The catalysts were labeled as Y%CNT-Pt/TiO2, where Y corresponds to the weight percentage of CNTs (1, 5, 10, and 20 wt%) in the CNT/TiO2 composite. The optical absorption of the powder solids was acquired by measuring the diffuse reflectance (DR) UV–Vis spectra using a JASCO V-560 UV–Vis spectrophotometer, equipped with an integrating sphere attachment (JASCO ISV-469). The spectra were recorded in diffuse reflectance mode and transformed to equivalent absorption Kubelka-Munk absorption units. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out at room temperature on a JASCO (FP 82000) fluorescence spectrometer equipped with a 150 W Xenon lamp as the light source. The excitation wavelength was set at 250 nm, using excitation and emission bandwidths of 5 and 10 nm, respectively. Impedance spectroscopy was performed under dark conditions at room temperature over a wide range of frequencies (40 Hz–100KHz), using Tegam3550 equipment. The measurements were carried out in a conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell: a working electrode with the synthesized catalysts immobilized on a gold electrode, a reference electrode (AgCl) and a platinum counter electrode. The electrolyte consisted of an aqueous solution containing 5 μM of NaCl and potassium hexacyanoferrate (ІІ) and potassium hexacyanoferrate (ІІІ) to form the redox couple Fe3+/Fe2+. Before the deposition of the materials, the gold electrodes were first cleaned with a Piranha solution, rinsed in distilled water and then dried. Then, ethanolic suspensions of the nanocomposites were spread over the gold electrodes and dried. Thermogravimetric analyses were performed by heating the sample in air flow from 50 °C to 900 °C at 20 °C min−1 using an STA 490PC/4/H Luxx Netzsch thermal apparatus. The specific surface area of the powder materials was determined using a Quantachrome NOVA 4200e multi-station equipment using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method."
4,Photocatalytic experiments,"2.3 Photocatalytic experiments The photocatalytic experiments were conducted in a cylindrical borosilicate glass reactor using a four UV-LED system as a light source (λ max = 384 nm), placed at a distance of 3.5 cm from the reactor. The nominal LED intensity reaching the reactor was c.a. 550 W m−2, as measured with a spectroradiometer (USB2000+, Ocean Optics, USA). In a typical experiment, the reactor was filled with 100 mL of methanol or glycerol aqueous solutions (2.5 M). The catalyst load was fixed at 0.5 g L−1, and the experiments were performed at ambient temperature (~25 °C). Before starting the photocatalytic reaction, the suspension was degassed under N2 flow for 20 min. Then, the irradiation was turn on, and the hydrogen evolution was followed using an Inficon Micro GC 3000 gas chromatograph apparatus equipped with a molsieve column and a micro-TCD detector using as carrier gas argon."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalysts characterization,"3.1 Catalysts characterization TEM micrographs of Pt/TiO2 revealed a good dispersion of Pt nanoparticles, with an average size of c.a. 5 nm, over spheroidal TiO2 particles with dimensions of 100–200 nm diameter (Fig. 1 a). In the case of the composite materials, long filaments with diameters of c.a. 10 nm, corresponding to CNTs, appear surrounded by TiO2 particles of bigger dimensions. Pt nanoparticles tend to be preferably attached to the carbon phase rather than in the TiO2 particles. This may be related to the creation of defects at the surface of the CNTs during the hydrothermal oxidation step, which act as anchoring sites for the Pt nanoparticles as can be visualized in Fig. 1b for the 20%CNT-Pt/TiO2 material. The thermogravimetric analysis confirmed the carbon content (wt.%) in the neat TiO2 and the CNT-Pt/TiO2 materials (Fig. 2 ). The hybrid materials were exposed to thermal treatment under airflow, and the weight loss was determined (Table 1 ). The CNT content in the materials, determined by TG, corresponds to the difference between the weight loss obtained for the composites and that obtained for bare TiO2. Results from the TG analyses show that TiO2 is quite stable under the conditions used during the thermal treatment, with no significant mass loss observed from the TG profile (Fig. 2). In the case of the CNT-Pt/TiO2 materials, excellent thermal stability was observed up to 550 °C. A very pronounced weight loss was observed between 550 and 700 °C for all the composites materials, attributed to the gasification of CNT, which increased with the CNTs content. The CNT content determined from the TG analysis somewhat agreed with the nominal CNT percentages of the prepared nanocomposites (Table 1). The SBET of neat TiO2 and CNT-Pt/TiO2 composites obtained from the N2 adsorption isotherms at −196 °C are displayed in Table 1. The TiO2 used in this work has an SBET of 11 m2 g−1. As expected, the introduction of the carbon phase leads to an increase of the SBET of the resulting composites, which in case of the materials with 1 and 5 wt% CNTs agrees with the theoretical values, obtained from the average surface area of each component in the composite material (values in brackets, Table 1). In the case of the composites containing 10 and 20 wt%, a slight increase in the SBET comparing with the theoretical value is observed, which may be attributed to the action of CNTs as dispersing medium for TiO2 particles [28]. The optical properties of the prepared materials were investigated by diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectroscopy (Fig. 3 a). As expected, the absorption spectrum of neat TiO2 shows the characteristic band edge around 400 nm, corresponding to the bandgap transition of the metal oxide semiconductor. The presence of Pt nanoparticles leads to a slight increase in the absorption in the visible range. The presence of CNTs promoted a further rise in absorption mostly in the visible range, increasing with the CNT content, which has been ascribed in several studies to the light absorption capacity of carbon materials and also to electronic interaction between CNT and TiO2 phases [28,29]. Comparing with Pt/TiO2, a slight decrease in the bandgap potential (E g ) was observed by the introduction of the carbon phase, as estimated from the prospective Tauc plots (Table 1). These observations may indicate the possibility of surface charge mobility between the CNT and the TiO2 upon photoexcitation. Photoluminescence (PL) analysis of optical semiconductors is a powerful tool for studying electronic species and their mechanisms of photoactivation and deactivation. Thus, to emphasize the optical response of the composite materials, PL measurements for bare TiO2, Pt/TiO2, and the CNT-Pt/TiO2 composites were performed. The band peaking between 375 and 425 nm, which appears in all spectra, is attributed to the band gap transition of the metal oxide semiconductor, while the bands in the 450–550 nm wavelength range are ascribed to PL excitons resulting from surface defects or vacancies [30] (Fig. 3b). Loading Pt nanoparticles over TiO2 leads to a dramatic decrease in the PL intensity due to their action as electron sinks, avoiding electron-hole recombination [31]. A progressive reduction in the PL signal was observed by the introduction of an increasing amount of the carbon phase in the composite materials. The quenching in the PL intensity for the CNT-Pt/TiO2 composite may indicate that photogenerated electrons can be transferred from TiO2 to the CNTs and Pt, thereby hindering the recombination with the holes [30,32,33]. These results may be rationalized in terms of the work function of each of the components of the synthesized nanohybrids: 4.2 eV for TiO2 [30] and 5.05 eV for CNTs [34], respectively, using vacuum level as reference. As the work function of TiO2 is smaller than the work function of CNTs, photoinduced electrons will flow from TiO2 to CNTs until their two Fermi levels are aligned. The Schottky barrier formed at the CNT/TiO2 interface acts as an efficient electron trap [35], thereby decreasing the recombination of charge carriers, leading to lower PL intensity. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is useful for differentiating electrical conduction processes and for analyzing the electrical behavior of materials [36]. From the experimental plotting of the impedance of Pt/TiO2 and CNT-Pt/TiO2 composites, it is clear that the incorporation of CNTs induces changes in the electrical properties of Pt/TiO2. The perfect dispersion of the experimental values indicates that Pt/TiO2 has good electrical properties (Fig. 4 ). On the other hand, the spectra consist of a semicircle due to Pt/TiO2 and CNT-Pt/TiO2 interphase charge transfer, indicating a non-Debye behavior [37]. A smaller radius of the arc in Nyquist plots means smaller resistance and increased electron mobility, which is observed by loading Pt on TiO2 [36]. Overall, these results indicate that the presence of CNTs lead to enhanced charge mobility in the hybrid materials, which is known to be a crucial factor accounting to nanomaterials performance as photocatalysts."
7,Photocatalytic H2 generation,"3.2 Photocatalytic H2 generation The effect of coupling CNTs to Pt/TiO2 was studied in the photocatalytic generation of hydrogen under UV-LED irradiation using methanol and glycerol as sacrificial agents. Methanol has been used in several studies as sacrificial electron donor for H2 production due to its simple molecular structure, high H:C ratio and to the possibility of being obtained from green processes [20,38]. Glycerol, a derivative from the industrial production of biodiesel via transesterification process, has also been widely used as sacrificial electron donor for photocatalytic H2 generation [39,40]. The mechanism of H2 production using Pt/TiO2 and methanol solutions has been described in the literature [20,41]. Involves the adsorption of methanol at the surface of TiO2 forming methoxy species, which are gradually oxidized via photogenerated holes, while H2 is produced from the available protons formed during the oxidation of such species. Finally, the adsorbed species are reduced by the photogenerated electrons on the surface of the Pt nanoparticles. In the case of glycerol, it has been reported that, in addition to acting as an electron donor, it is the primary source of hydrogen compared to water [39]. Lalitha et al. proposed that using Cu2O/TiO2 catalysts, glycerol is attacked by hydroxyl radical formed from water reaction with photogenerated holes, suffering several dehydration steps forming smaller intermediates and ultimately H2O and CO2 [42]. Another possibility is the direct dehydrogenation of the molecule through reaction with holes [43]. In the present work, it was found that, in general, the presence of CNTs promote an increase in the photoefficiency of the process compared with the Pt/TiO2 (Fig. 5 ), clearly indicating the beneficial effect of CNTs on the photocatalytic performance of CNT-TiO2 hybrids for hydrogen production. Among the materials tested, the composite containing the lowest CNT content (1 wt%) was the most effective for H2 generation, with 2327 and 2091 μmol g−1 of this gas being formed after 120 min of irradiation using aqueous solutions of either methanol (Fig. 5b) or glycerol (Fig. 5d), respectively. These results represent a 2.7- and a 5-fold increase in H2 production when compared with those obtained using Pt/TiO2, respectively. The photocatalytic performance of the CNT-Pt/TiO2 nanocomposites decreased when the CNT content exceeded 1 wt%. The materials containing 5 and 10 wt% CNTs present similar behavior toward H2 production. Although the amounts of H2 generated using these two materials is substantial lower comparing with 1%CNT-Pt/TiO2, they still show better performance than Pt/TiO2. In the case of the material with the highest CNT content (20 wt%), no positive effect on H2 production was observed. Previous works have reported that CNTs may play distinct roles in CNT-TiO2 photocatalysts, depending on their intrinsic textural and electronic properties and the radiation wavelength used [19,25–27]. As described in the previous section, the surface area of the hybrid materials increased with the CNT content. Nevertheless, the best performing photocatalyst (1%CNT-Pt/TiO2) and Pt/TiO2 have a similar surface area. Thus, the enhanced activity of the composite material may not be related to the action of CNTs as co-adsorbent. It was verified that the introduction of CNTs did quench the intensity of luminescence of Pt/TiO2 (Fig. 3b), indicating a decrease in electron-hole recombination promoted by the carbon phase in the hybrid catalysts. Since the materials were submitted to UV light, the photoactivation mechanism is expected to occur through direct excitation of TiO2, followed by charge separation and electron transfer to the CNT phase, and ultimately to Pt nanoparticles, which act as electron sinks. This rationalization is also in line with the results from the Nyquist plots (Fig. 4) of CNT-Pt/TiO2 materials, which indicated improved electron mobility compared with Pt/TiO2. The decrease in the photoactivity of the hybrid materials for CNT contents higher than 1 wt% may be related to light scattering caused by an excessive amount of the carbon phase [28,44]. This effect was more pronounced for 20%CNT-Pt/TiO2, which showed lower activity than Pt/TiO2 for H2 generation using both methanol and glycerol aqueous solutions. Thus, the enhanced activity of 1%CNT-Pt/TiO2 may be ascribed to enhanced mobility of charge carriers, mostly to the efficient electron-hole separation, and to an appropriate CNT load which did not affect light penetration in the aqueous suspensions. Another aspect worthy of discussion is the fact that when using aqueous solutions of glycerol, it was observed an inducing period before H2 started to be produced (~15 min for 1%CNT-Pt/TiO2 and ~30 min for the reactions using the other catalysts). This behavior may be related to the multistep degradation of glycerol, suggesting that it may act as the primary source of H+, rather than water. The results confirmed that biomass-derived compounds such as methanol and glycerol might act as sacrificial reagents for H2 production using the catalysts proposed in this work. Finally, the stability of 1%CNT-Pt/TiO2 was assessed by using the same catalyst sample in 3 consecutive reactions (Fig. 6 ). After each run, the catalyst was separated, washed with water and dried overnight and then re-suspended in fresh solutions of methanol and glycerol. It was found that 1%CNT-Pt/TiO2 was very stable at least during three cycles of utilization using both methanol and glycerol aqueous solutions, which make this a promising catalyst for photocatalytic H2 production under UV-LED irradiation. In previous works, it has been reported that when the impregnation/reduction route is used for decorating TiO2 with Pt nanoparticles, the reduction occurs from the external to internal sites [40,45]. Once the outer layer is reduced to metallic Pt, the reduction of the interior is hindered by the outer shell. When the catalyst is exposed to light, oxidized sites may be reduced following a phenomenon analogous to in situ metal photo-deposition, which may rationalize the successive increase in the amount of H2 generated in the second and third cycles."
8,Conclusions,"CNT-Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts prepared by a simple one-pot oxidation and hydrothermal route were successfully used for photocatalytic hydrogen production from methanol and glycerol aqueous solutions. Loading TiO2 with CNTs in the 1–10 wt% range leads to an increase in the H2 production rate. This synergic effect is related to an increase in the efficiency of charge separation and mobility in the hybrid materials promoted by CNTs. The 1%CNT-Pt/TiO2 material displayed the highest photoactivity for H2 production under UV-LED (384 nm) irradiation. Also, this catalyst shows excellent photostability during at least three cycles of utilization. Although the reactions using methanol result in higher H2 production (2327 μmol g−1 comparing with 2091 μmol g−1 obtained with glycerol), the synergic effect observed by the introduction of 1 wt% of CNT is more pronounced in the reactions using glycerol as sacrificial agent (5-fold increase in H2 production comparing with Pt/TiO2)."
