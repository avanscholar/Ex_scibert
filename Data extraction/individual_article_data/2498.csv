0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is an important energy carrier, and has potential for motive power application, including cars, boats, and portable electronics. Hydrogen can be produced from fossil sources, e.g., natural gas, coal, etc. However, this process releases additional carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. An alternative, carbon-neutral route for hydrogen production is the reforming of biomass-derived alcohols, e.g., ethanol and butanol [1,2]. Ethanol has been extensively studied for decades, while butanol can be another important resource via fermentation of biomass [3,4]. The availability of butanol can be improved in two ways: first, by producing improved strains of bacteria, e.g., the bacteria Clostridia, which was reported to be effective in breaking down and fermenting biomass, especially from cellulosic resources [4,5], and second, by improved equipment for managing fermentation and reducing water and energy consumption [4,6]. Compared with ethanol, butanol has more carbon atoms and higher heat value but is more difficult to be activated for hydrogen production [7]. Thus, the process for hydrogen production from butanol can be a concern. Among the processes for hydrogen production from alcohols, steam reforming (SR) has long been used in the industry, but a high heat input is required because SR needs a strong endothermic reaction. Catalytic partial oxidation (CPOX) is a self-sustaining heat process for hydrogen production from alcohols, in which oxygen or air, instead of water, is fed with alcohols, and the heat of the reaction can be adjusted by regulating the ratio of O2/alcohol [8–10]. CPOX of butanol can be an effective route for hydrogen production. In CPOX, butanol is converted and oxidized into CO or CO2 with H2 production via Eqs. (1) and (2) [11]. (1) C 4 H 9 OH + 3 2 O 2 = 4 CO + 5 H 2 + 114.4 kJ / mol (2) C 4 H 9 OH + 7 2 O 2 = 4 CO 2 + 5 H 2 + 1247.2 kJ mol There are several concerns with CPOX. One concern is sintering because the oxygen is consumed at the leading edge of the catalyst bed where temperatures can be 1000 °C or higher [12,13]. Another concern is the oxidation of the active component, e.g., nickel metal, at the leading edge in the oxidative atmosphere of CPOX, in which the reaction zone will move downstream; eventually, all of the active components in the catalyst bed will be oxidized and lose activity [14,15]. In addition, the carbon deposition or coking can be a severe issue, because butanol has more carbon atoms than ethanol, and a higher activation energy is needed to break the C–C bond; without the appropriate catalysts, carbon will be extracted and cover the active sites, blocking the channel of catalyst bed and resulting in deactivation [7,16]. In the previous work [14] on auto-thermal reforming (ATR) of ethanol with oxygen and water, LDH-derived Ni-based catalysts were proved effective for their thermal stability and high resistance to oxidation and coking in ATR process. LDH, also called hydrotalcite-like compound, can be used as catalysts and catalyst supports [17], and has been intensively studied for its catalytic applications, including carbon dioxide reforming of methane [18], photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue [19], oxidation of cyclooctene, cyclohexene, and cyclohexane by iodosylbenzene [20], epoxidation of styrene with molecular oxygen [21], etc. In the present work, a thermodynamic analysis was firstly carried out to find the optimal conditions for hydrogen production via CPOX of n-butanol. The aforementioned LDH-derived catalysts were then tested in CPOX of n-butanol. Characterizations were tested as well to find the relationship between the structure and the reactivity in CPOX of butanol."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The LDH-derived Ni-based catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation [14]. Three aqueous solutions of nitrate salts of nickel, magnesium, aluminum, and iron (Alfa Aesar, AR) with molar ratios of Ni/Mg/Al/Fe = 0.35/2.65/1.0/0, 0.35/2.65/0.5/0.5, and 0.35/2.65/0/1.0 were prepared, respectively, and the solutions of sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide (Alfa Aesar, AR) at CO3 2−/OH−1 = 16 were also prepared as a precipitator. Then, the three solutions of metal nitrates were precipitated by the sodium salt solution at pH 10.5 ± 0.5, respectively. The obtained precipitations were aged at 78 °C for 24 h, filtrated and washed with deionized water 3 times, dried at 105 °C, and calcined at 650 °C for 4 h. The obtained catalysts were named as NiMgAl for Ni0.35Mg2.65AlO4.5±δ , NiMgAlFe for Ni0.35Mg2.65Al0.5Fe0.5O4.5±δ , and NiMgFe for Ni0.35Mg2.65FeO4.5±δ , respectively."
3,Characterizations,"2.2 Characterizations X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were carried out with an X-ray diffractometer (Siemens D5000) equipped with a graphite monochromator for Cu K alpha radiation at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 30 mA. The BET surface area and pore size distribution of the catalysts were measured by N2 adsorption at liquid N2 temperature of −196 °C with an automatic adsorption instrument (Autosorb-1, QuantaChrome). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded by an Ultra DLD spectrometer (Kratos, UK) using Al K alpha radiation (1486.6 eV). The binding energies were calibrated relative to the C1s peak from the carbon contamination of the samples at 284.6 eV. The samples were reduced at 650 °C, and then transferred into the chamber for XPS test."
4,Catalytic performance test,"2.3 Catalytic performance test Catalytic partial oxidation (CPOX) of butanol was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor. Catalysts (grain size of 20–40 mesh) were loaded and reduced with a H2/N2 mixture at 700 °C for 4 h. A feed of butanol was introduced by a pump (Shimadzu LC-20AD) and vaporized at 160 °C, then mixed with oxygen and nitrogen (nitrogen is used as an internal standard for calibration). The mixture gases were then introduced into the reactor through heated lines. The gases were analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC 2014), which includes Porapaq-QS columns and 5A columns connected with a TCD for analysis of the permanent gases and a Q-Plot capillary column with a FID for analysis of the organics. The following parameters were defined to gauge the performance of the catalysts: X butnaol = F butanol in − F butanol out F butanol in S i carbon - containing product = F i carbon - containing product n i · ( F butanol in − F butanol out ) Y H 2 = F H 2 product F butanol in In the above equations, X butanol and S i represent the butanol conversion and the selectivity to the i product, respectively. F i, in or out is the molar flow rate of the i species at the inlet or at the outlet of the reactor, and n i is the stoichiometric factor between the carbon-containing products and the butanol. Y H 2 is the hydrogen yield, which is the molar ratio of the produced H2 based on imputed butanol. Mass balance on carbon and hydrogen typically has a margin of error of ±3%."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Thermodynamic analysis on temperature and feed in CPOX of butanol,"3.1 Thermodynamic analysis on temperature and feed in CPOX of butanol The equilibrium compositions in CPOX of n-butanol were analyzed using the minimization of the total Gibbs free energy, and C1–C4 products were included. The thermal decomposition of butanol was firstly analyzed and is shown in Fig. 1 (A). CH4 is the major product within the 25 °C−1000 °C range, with a maximum of 56.2% at 602 °C. There are C2, C3, and C4 products observed below 200 °C, especially for the butane, which reaches as high as 29.4% at 25 °C. At higher temperatures, e.g., 250 °C or above, these C2–C4 products decrease, except for two olefins: the propylene, which emerges and reaches 6.55% near 380 °C, and the ethylene, which emerges near 300 °C and increases with increasing temperature, and reaches 17.9% at 1000 °C. CO is another major C1 product, which reaches 30.4% at 284 °C and decreases slightly with increasing temperature. On the contrary, CO2 starts at 25.0% at 25 °C, but declines sharply and disappears near 300 °C. Hydrogen, which is almost invisible below 600 °C, increases slightly with increasing temperatures, and reaches 12.6% at 1000 °C. These results suggest that the thermal decomposition of butanol cannot be an effective route for hydrogen production. With both butanol and oxygen in the feed of CPOX for hydrogen production, an apparent difference is found in the equilibrium compositions. As shown in Fig. 1(B), which has a molar ratio of O2/butanol = 1, all of the C2–C4 products disappear, suggesting that the CPOX of butanol is thermodynamically unfavorable to these C2–C4 products. CH4, CO, and CO2 are the three major C1 products: CH4 and CO2 dominate the equilibrium compositions below 300 °C, but decrease sharply with temperatures higher than 300 °C; CO becomes the major composition at 600 °C and above, because the exothermic water-gas shift reaction (WGSR, or CO + H2O = CO2 + H2) plays an important role in the ratio of CO/CO2. Hydrogen, as the objective product, emerges near 350 °C and reaches 43.1% at 1000 °C. With oxygen in the feed, water was found and reaches 3.36% near 562 °C. No O2 remains in the equilibrium gases. With more oxygen in the feed, as shown in Fig. 1(C–F), the content of methane decreases significantly, and reaches 1% from 901 °C at O2/butanol = 1.5–702 °C at O2/butanol = 3.0. The CO and CO2 both increase with higher ratios of O2/butanol. The most significant change was found in water: there is only a trace of water at O2/butanol = 1.0 (Fig. 1(B)), but the water composition increases with higher O2/butanol ratios (Fig. 1(C)–(F)), especially at low temperatures. For O2/butanol = 3.0, the water composition varies from 16.5% to 33.3%, indicating that more hydrogen atoms are extracted from the butanol and transformed into the water instead of into H2. H2, also as a product of the water-gas shift reaction, reaches relatively high values near 45.2–55.0% at 700 °C or above at O2/butanol = 1.5–2.0, suggesting that an optimal O2/butanol ratio may be at 1.5–2.0 for the CPOX test."
7,Experimental results of the NiMgAlFe catalyst with different feeds and temperatures,"3.2 Experimental results of the NiMgAlFe catalyst with different feeds and temperatures Analysis of thermodynamics points out the equilibrium compositions, while the yield of the product gas is determined by the dynamics or reaction rates via different reaction routes over different catalysts; therefore, this needs to be proved by CPOX experiments. For the transformation routes of butanol in CPOX, the first step is the adsorption of butanol over the catalysts, where butanol can be activated and dissociated with O2. Then the resulting intermediate species, such as the C4, C3, C2, and C1 species, can react with the O2 and the H2O. Accordingly, via adjusting the oxygen in the feed, the activation of butanol and the intermediate products can be modified; thus, the reaction routes can be diverted to obtain a high hydrogen yield [22,23]. Meanwhile, the overall heat can be adjusted to be self-sustaining as well, compared with endothermic steam reforming of butanol [8]. To find the application possibilities of CPOX for hydrogen production, the experiments on CPOX of butanol were carried out with different ratios of O2 to butanol at 700 °C over a selected catalyst of NiMgAlFe (Ni0.35Mg2.65Al0.5Fe0.5O4.5±δ ), which is an LDH-derived catalyst. All data were recorded at the 1-h point at different temperatures with various ratios of O2 to butanol. As shown in Fig. 2 , the conversion of butanol was near 100% at 700 °C when O2/butanol is 1.5, suggesting that all butanol had been converted. The yield of H2 was near 3.76 mol-H2/mol-butanol, indicating that about 75.2% of hydrogen from butanol was transformed into H2, while the remaining hydrogen atoms from butanol were transformed into water as well as hydrocarbons (mostly as methane). Among these products, about 16.0% of the hydrogen atoms were transformed into water, and about 8.8% of the hydrogen atoms were transformed into methane. Meanwhile, for the carbon in butanol, the selectivity to CO is near 81.2%, the selectivity to CO2 is near 8.2%, and the selectivity to methane is about 10.6%. These results suggest that to obtain a higher yield of H2, more hydrogen should be extracted from methane and water. With more oxygen introduced into the process, the yield of H2 reaches a maximum of 4.01 at a ratio of O2/butanol = 2.0. The reason can be found in the products of water and methane: the yield of water drops to 0.74 mol-H2O/mol-butanol and the selectivity to methane decreases to 9.2%. Changes in the selectivity to CO and CO2 were found with higher O2/butanol ratios, from 2.5 to 3.5. The selectivity to CO decreased constantly with a constant increase in the selectivity to CO2. A much higher O2/butanol, e.g., 3.0 or 3.5, led to a much lower yield of H2 because more butanol was converted to water and CO2, despite a slight decrease in the selectivity to methane. As shown in Fig. 2, when the O2/butanol ratio reached 3.5, the yield of water was 1.88 mol-H2O/mol-butanol. These results suggest that an optimal ratio of O2/butanol can be near 2.0. To find the effects of temperature, the LDH-derived catalyst of NiMgAlFe was tested in CPOX of butanol at different temperatures. As shown in Fig. 3 , a low initial hydrogen yield was observed at 600 °C, and the hydrogen yield then increased to about 3.59 mol-H2/mol-butanol, but declined to about 2.56 mol-H2/mol-butanol at 20-h. A higher hydrogen yield near 3.98 mol-H2/mol-butanol was observed at 650 °C; however, it declined at 11-h and dropped to 2.52 mol H2/mol butanol. This decrease in hydrogen yield can be attributed to the by-products: C2H4, C2H6, C3H6 and C3H8 were found overtime in the product gas, especially for the C2H4, which is considered as the main precursor of coke during CPOX test. As observed in the spent catalysts after test of CPOX at 600 °C and 650 °C, there was severe coking, which resulted in activity loss. Stable activity was observed at 700 °C: the hydrogen yield remained stable near 4.02 mol-H2/mol-butanol. With a higher temperature of 750 °C, the hydrogen yield reached 4.38 mol H2/mol butanol, which can be attributed to a lower selectivity to the CH4 near 5.8%, as compared with 9.2% at 700 °C. These results suggest that temperature plays an important role in reaction routes, especially for temperatures lower than 700 °C."
8,"Experimental results of NiMgAl, NiMgAlFe and NiMgFe at 700 °C in CPOX of butanol","3.3 Experimental results of NiMgAl, NiMgAlFe and NiMgFe at 700 °C in CPOX of butanol NiMgAlFe was found to be effective in auto-thermal reforming (ATR) of ethanol for hydrogen production [14], in which aluminum and iron play an important role in stability. To find the effects of Al and Fe in CPOX of n-butanol, the LDH-derived Ni–Mg–O catalysts with aluminum and/or iron were then tested in the CPOX process. As shown in Fig. 4 (A), the NiMgAl catalyst, Ni0.35Mg2.65AlO4.5±δ , produced about 3.68 mol-H2/mol-butanol at the beginning, but then declined and reached about 2.02 mol-H2/mol-butanol at 31-h. The reason can be found within the carbon-containing products: although the conversion of butanol was near 100%, the selectivity to CO decreased from 69.7% to 58.9%, and the selectivity to CO2 decreased from about 20.4% to 13.1%. The selectivity to CH4 varied slightly from 4.5% to 6.1%. The selectivity to ethane remained within 1.1%–1.9%. The selectivity to ethylene increased and reached 15.5%, while the selectivity to propylene increased to 2.2%. With iron in the NiMgAlFe, a stable performance was observed: the conversion of butanol remained at 100%, and the H2 yield reached 4.03 mol-H2/mol-butanol in the 31-h test. All of the carbon-containing products (CO, CO2 and CH4) were stable in the product gas, and the selectivity to other products, e.g., ethane and propane, were below 0.2%, and the ethylene and propylene almost disappeared. Over the NiMgFe, in which the aluminum was completely replaced by iron, a similar stable performance was observed as well. The average H2 yield near 3.92 mol-H2/mol-butanol over NiMgFe was slightly lower than that of NiMgAlFe, and the reason can be attributed to the higher selectivity to ethane at 1.3% and to propane at 0.2%; meanwhile, only traces of ethylene and propylene were found in the gas."
9,Characterizations of the LDH-derived Ni-based catalysts,"3.4 Characterizations of the LDH-derived Ni-based catalysts The variation of these LDH-derived Ni-based catalysts in CPOX can be found in the structural and electronic properties. The nitrogen physisorption was then conducted to measure the textural properties of these catalysts. NiMgAlFe has a higher surface area of 178.2 m2/g, as compared with NiMgAl at 149.5 m2/g and NiMgFe at 133.2 m2/g. Fig. 5 of N2-physisorption shows how the texture of these LDH-derived catalysts varies. All of the samples show typical adsorption–desorption isotherms of macropores and/or mesopores. A high adsorption volume was observed with high iron content in NiMgAlFe and NiMgFe, while NiMgFe has the highest value of 1.198 cm3/g. The pore size distribution indicates that with iron, the pore size becomes larger, and the average pore size increases from 21.6 nm in NiMgAl, to 24.3 nm in NiMgAlFe, and to 34.1 nm in NiMgFe. These results indicate that Fe can effectively increase the surface area and pore volume, and can bring about a higher average pore size in NiMgAlFe and NiMgFe. To find the crystal structures, the catalysts were screened by X-ray diffraction (XRD), as shown in Fig. 6 . For the oxides of these Ni-based catalysts, there are peaks of the face-centered cubic (FCC) phase of periclase (MgO, PDF #: 45–0946) in NiMgAl. Because NiO can form a similar FCC structure (PDF #: 47–1049), there are probably mixed crystals of Mg(Ni)O, e.g., Mg0.4Ni0.6O (PDF #: 34–0410), in a Fm-3m space group [24,25].With iron in NiMgAlFe and NiMgFe, there was a trace of the spinel phase of NiFe2O4. For the reduced samples (Fig. 6(B)), no obvious differences were found in the XRD patterns, and no Ni0 metal was found as well, suggesting either that there was no Ni0 species or that the Ni0 was in an amorphous state [26]. For the spent NiMgAl catalysts after the 31-h CPOX test (Fig. 6(C)), the peaks of Mg(Ni)O intensified, and the particle size, estimated by the peak at 43.5°, significantly increased to 35.4 nm from 5.2 nm in the reduced NiMgAl catalyst. On the contrary, the peaks of the NiMgAlFe remained broadened, and the particle size was about 9.4 nm; the particle size of the NiMgFe was about 14.8 nm. The results indicate that better thermal stability was observed in the NiMgAlFe with both aluminum and iron, while sintering was observed over the NiMgAl without iron. These findings were consistent with the results of CPOX, in which a stable performance was obtained over the NiMgAlFe with better thermal stability, while a fading performance was observed over the sintered NiMgAl catalyst during the CPOX process. To find the electronic state of the Ni species, the reduced and spent catalysts were screened with XPS as well, and the spectra of Ni 2p were recorded and are shown in Fig. 7 . Within the region of Ni 2p3/2, over the reduced NiMgAl catalysts, the peak near 852.6 eV can be attributed the Ni0 metal, while the peaks near 855.8 eV and 863.2 eV can be attributed to the Ni2+ species and the shakeup peak, respectively [27–29]. These results suggest that these Ni0 species could be in an amorphous state, which cannot be found in the XRD. For the catalysts of NiMgAlFe and NiMgFe with iron, the peak of Ni0 intensified and indicates that there are more Ni0 species. The quantitative results show that the percentages of Ni0 calculated are 10.9% in NiMgAl, 27.0% in NiMgAlFe, and 18.7% in NiMgFe, respectively. After the 31-h CPOX of butanol, the spectra of Ni 2p3/2 showed a similar trend: there are weak peaks of Ni0 species over the NiMgAl with 12.4% Ni in a metal state, and stronger peaks of the Ni0 species were observed over the NiMgAlFe and NiMgFe, with 33.0% and 26.8% of Ni0, respectively. The results suggest that oxidation may not be the main reason for the decrease in activity for NiMgAl, but the sintering could be the main reason for deactivation during CPOX. Compared with NiMgAl, more Ni0 species with thermal stability result in higher activity in NiMgAlFe and NiMgFe, which is also consistent with the results of activity tests, in which NiMgAlFe and NiMgFe performed better than NiMgAl. Based on the characterizations, the NiMgAl has a surface area of 149.5 m2/g and a Ni0 content of 10.9%, which resulted in a relatively high activity in the beginning; because sintering was found during the CPOX test, as indicated by the XRD, the activity of the NiMgAl faded over time. With iron in the NiMgAlFe, there were a surface area of 178.2 m2/g, an average pore size of 24.3 nm, and more Ni0 (about 27.0%); more importantly, the thermal stability was proved by XRD and XPS; thus the H2 yield remained stable at 4.03 mol-H2/mol-butanol. For the NiMgFe with an average pore size of 34.1 nm, and a Ni0 content of 18.7% was found by XPS; therefore a H2 yield was obtained with 3.92 mol-H2/mol-butanol. As compared with auto-thermal reforming (ATR) of ethanol, which produced a H2 yield at 2.5–3.7 mol-H2/mol-ethanol [14], CPOX of butanol over the LDH derived NiMgFeAl catalyst with a H2 yield of 4.03 mol-H2/mol-butanol shows potential as an alternative route for hydrogen production."
10,Conclusions,"The equilibrium compositions in CPOX of butanol were analyzed using the minimization of the total Gibbs free energy. Results suggest that a higher hydrogen production can be achieved by feeding the O2/butanol near 2.0 and keeping the temperatures at 700 °C. LDH-derived Ni-based catalysts were tested in CPOX of butanol, and the Ni0.35Mg2.65Al0.5Fe0.5O4.5±δ catalyst showed stable activity for hydrogen production: the H2 yield remained stable near 4.03 mol-H2/mol-butanol in the 31-h test. Characterizations indicate that with iron in the Ni0.35Mg2.65Al0.5Fe0.5O4.5±δ catalyst, a higher surface area was obtained at 178.2 m2/g, with an average pore size of 24.3 nm and a mean particle size of 5.6 nm; after the 31-h test of the CPOX of butanol, 27.0% of the Ni0 remained stable in the oxidative atmosphere of the CPOX, and the mean crystal particle size remained near 9.4 nm. These results help to explain the stability of CPOX."
