0,Introduction,"Alcohol is a primitive addictive factor which causes several social and health problems (Galicia-Moreno and Gutierrez-Reyes, 2014). Although moderate alcohol consumption is recognized for its health benefits such as protection from heart stroke, diabetes, and hypertension (Berger et al., 1999; Sacco et al., 1999), excessive and prolonged alcohol consumption causes alcohol liver diseases (ALD) which are mainly responsible for chronic liver disease, fibrosis cirrhosis and hepatic carcinoma, which can be summed-up with premature mortality elevation and life expectancy shortening (Coelho et al., 2013; Gao and Bataller, 2011). In the progression of ALD, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to play a crucial role (Song et al., 2006). Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), one of the three main enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism, metabolizes ethanol to more reactive products elevating ROS generation and is a major target in current therapeutic medicine against alcohol toxicity (Knockaert et al., 2011; Lu and Cederbaum, 2008; Tanaka et al., 1997). CYP2E1 in mitochondria also contributes to the overproduction of mitochondrial ROS and depletes glutathione (GSH) in ethanol exposure (Knockaert et al., 2011). Since ROS are produced in the ethanol metabolic process, cells have developed several protective measures against harmful effects of ROS and maintain the balance between free radicals and antioxidant function (Wu and Cederbaum, 2003). Acute or chronic ethanol exposure is responsible for excessive ROS production in hepatocyte alcohol metabolism and then for the lipid peroxidation, antioxidant depletion, DNA damage, oxidative damage of cellular protein and membrane lipids, hepatocyte injury, which eventually results in cell death (Hemnani and Parihar, 1998; Jaeschke et al., 2002; Wu and Cederbaum, 2003). Hence, maintaining the balance between ROS-triggered apoptotic effect and systemic response against it is crucial in regulating the progression of ALD (Wang, 2014). Drugs like corticosteroids, antiviral, and immunosuppressant are currently prescribed for liver diseases (Abou Seif, 2014). However, such therapeutic agents are inadequate to recover livers from diseases such as fatty liver, cirrhosis, and hepatitis; they often inflict hepatic damages in prolonged use (Abou Seif, 2014). Hence, developing natural product based therapeutic agents is of high interest in managing ALD. Sasa quelpaertensis is a native Korean dwarf bamboo known to inhabit only at mount Halla, Jeju Island, Korea (Kim et al., 2014b). Its leaf extracts contain a mixture of amino acids, polysaccharides, and more importantly polyphenols such as p-coumaric acid and tricin (Kim et al., 2013a, 2015a,b) and are reported to show beneficial biological properties such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, lipid metabolism, antiviral, and anticancer activities (Kim et al., 2013a,b, 2014a,b). It is well known that the more phenolic and flavonoid constituent extracts have, the more potent their antioxidant activity is (Khorasani Esmaeili et al., 2015). Health promoting efficacy of S. quelpaertensis leaf extracts has been further examined in more practical contexts recently: they are shown to exhibit protection against radiation induced oxidative stress in mice (Kim et al., 2015a,b) and to attenuate oleic-induced lipid metabolism in HepG2 cells (Kim et al., 2013a). Interestingly, it turns out that different concentrations of ethanol, an efficient solvent for S. quelpaertensis yielding high content of polyphenolic compounds in the extract (Kim et al., 2013b), in solvent medium produce leaf extracts of widely varying potency. For instance, 70% ethanol extract of S. quelpaertensis is identified for modulating antioxidant enzymes in dextran sulfate sodium-induced mouse colitis (Yeom and Kim, 2015). Various fractions (chloroform and ethyl acetate) of 80% ethanol extracts also showed high content of phenolic acids and flavonoids predominantly p-coumaric acid, ruitin and myricetin (unpublished data). In this study, we evaluated different extracts of S. quelpaertensis (Distilled water (DW), 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% EtOH extracts) for their cytoprotective effect against alcohol-induced cytotoxicity. Identifying 80% ethanol extract of S. quelpaertensis leaves (SQEE80) the most effective against alcohol-induced toxicity, we investigated its hepatoprotective effect against alcohol-induced oxidative stress and antioxidant enzyme expression using HepG2 cells followed by assays using mouse models. In mouse models, we induced liver injury through oral administration of ethanol with or without SQEE80 and investigated the toxicity of ethanol on liver and hepatoprotective effect of SQEE80 on ethanol toxicity."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Bamboo extraction preparation,"2.1 Bamboo extraction preparation S. quelpaertensis leaves purchased from Jeju Plant Resource Lab in 2015 at dry condition were pulverized into 1 mm fine powder to increase the surface area. Then, coarse powder of (5 g) S. quelpaertensis leaf extract (SQE) was obtained by dissolving the pulverized fine powder in 100 mL of distilled water (SQEDW), 20% (v/v) EtOH (SQEE20), 40% (v/v) EtOH (SQEE40), 60% (v/v) EtOH (SQEE60), and 80% (v/v) EtOH (SQEE80), respectively, in ultrasonic bath (Power sonic 520, Hwashin Co., Korea) for 90 min. The extraction process was carried out in triplicate to maximize the yield. The solution was filtered by using Whatman No. 2 filtering papers (Whatman International Limited, Kent, England) and concentrated to dryness by using rotary vacuum evaporator (Hei-VAP Precision, Heidolph, Germany). Dried samples were stored under −20 °C until usage."
3,Cell culture,"2.2 Cell culture HepG2 cells, human liver epithelial-like monolayer hepatoblastoma cells, were used for in vitro assays. Although derived from the liver tissue of a hepatocellular carcinoma patient, HepG2 cells exhibit many characteristic functions of normal human liver hepatocytes and are widely used in liver related studies (Balasubramaniyan et al., 2007; Knasmüller et al., 2004; Louvet and Mathurin, 2015; Reddy et al., 2008). HepG2 cells of initial passage number 100 were obtained from Korean cell line bank (The Korean cell line bank (KCLB) number 88065). Cells were cultured in 75 cm2 cell culture flasks (SPL Life sciences, Korea) containing Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics (100 U/mL of penicillin and 100 μg/mL of streptomycin, Gibco Life Technologies, NY, USA), and incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in a humidified chamber. Cells reached >80% confluence were subcultured at the density of 4 × 106 cells/dish. HepG2 cells of >95% viability were used in the current study."
4,MTT and colony formation assay to measure cytotoxicity and cytoprotective effect of SQE in ethanol exposed HepG2 cells,"2.3 MTT and colony formation assay to measure cytotoxicity and cytoprotective effect of SQE in ethanol exposed HepG2 cells Thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed to assess the cell viability as previously described (Sun et al., 2011). In brief, HepG2 cells (1 × 104/well) were seeded in 96-well plates in triplicate and allowed for 12 h to adhere to each other at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in a humidified chamber. Then, cells were treated with varying concentrations (0, 3.9, 7.8, 15.6, 31.2, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, and 1000 μg/mL) of various SQEs (SQEDW, SQEE20, SQEE40, SQEE60, SQEE80), respectively, and incubated in a humidified chamber. Similarly, cells were treated with identical set of concentrations of various SQEs, respectively, with simultaneous exposure to 800 mM ethanol and incubated similarly. After 24 h incubation, 15 μl of MTT (5 mg/mL of stock, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each well of both batches for 4 h incubation. Then formazan crystals were dissolved in 100 μL/well of solubilization buffer [10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 50% dimethyl formamide (Sigma-Aldrich)] and absorbance of each well was read at 540 nm using an immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate reader. In parallel, we performed colony formation assay to assess the clonogenesity of HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells (1 × 103) were seeded in 6-well plates and incubated for 10 days to form normal colonies, and, after an overnight attachment, cells were exposed to varying concentrations of different SQEs with or without EtOH for 24 h. The cells were then washed with DPBS and allowed to grow for 10 days (Wu et al., 2015). Medium was replaced at every three days. Then the cells were fixed with a methanol/acetic acid (3:1) mixture for 5 s at room temperature. The fixed cells were washed with DPBS and stained with 0.4% crystal violet for 30–60 s. Stained cells were washed with distilled water several times, air dried, and the number of colonies was counted by eye. Confirming that SQEE80 was the most effective extract fraction through preliminary experiments, we utilized it throughout the rest of this study."
5,DCF-DA assay,"2.4 DCF-DA assay Production of intracellular ROS was evaluated using 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) assay as previously described with minor modifications (Žegura et al., 2004). In brief, HepG2 cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 104/well in 96-well plates in triplicate and allowed to adhere to each other for 12 h in a humidified chamber at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cells were then treated with varying concentrations (0, 250, and 500 μg/mL) of SQEE80 with a simultaneous application of 800 mM ethanol in order to induce ethanol cytotoxicity. After 24 h exposure, cells were incubated with 2.5 mM of DCF-DA fluorescent dye for 30 min in dark. Fluorescence intensity at excitation wavelength of 485 nm and emission wavelength of 530 nm was determined using a microplate reading spectrofluorometer."
6,Griess assay,"2.5 Griess assay Production of nitric oxide (NO) in culture supernatants of HepG2 cells was measured in the form of nitrite, a quantitative measure of NO using Griess reagent as previously described (Senthil Kumar et al., 2012). In brief, HepG2 cells (1 × 105 cells/mL) were incubated in triplicate in 96-well plates for 12 h and treated with or without SQEE80 (250, 500 μg/mL) in the presence of ethanol (800 mM) and allowed for 24 h for incubation. After that, culture supernatants were reacted with equal volume of Griess reagents (0.2% naphthylethylene diamine in distilled water and 2% sulfanilamide in 10% phosphoric acid) at room temperature for 10 min in dark. The absorbance at 570 nm was measured by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate reader. The nitrite concentration in culture supernatants was measured using a standard curve of freshly prepared sodium nitrite."
7,Western blot,"2.6 Western blot HepG2 cells were cultured in 10 cm diameter cell culture dishes in two replicates at a density of 4 × 106 cells/dish. After an overnight incubation, cells were treated with or without SQEE80 (250, 500 μg/mL) in the presence of ethanol (800 mM) and allowed for 24 h for incubation at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in a humidified chamber. Cells were washed twice with cold DPBS and harvested by scraping. Harvested HepG2 cells or liver tissues were homogenized in TNN buffer (40 mM Tris, pH 8; 120 mM NaCl; 0.1% Nonidet P-40; 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF); 0.5 μg/mL leupeptin; 2 μg/mL aprotinin; 10 mM sodium orthvanadate). Protein concentration was measured by Bio-Rad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) protein assay and equal amount of protein (40 μg/well) was electrophoresed in 10–15% SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). After being transferred to, nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) were blocked with 2% skim milk and incubated with primary antibodies (Glutathione peroxidase (GPX)-1, Catalase: Santacruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA; CYP2E1: Millipore, Temecula, CA; β-Actin: Sigma, Saint Louis, USA) over night at 4 °C. The membranes were washed three times and incubated again with IgG-horse-radish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) for 45 min at room temperature. Binding of each antibody was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (WestOne, iNtRON, Sungnam, Korea) and densitometric analysis was performed using ImageJ software (version 1.47)."
8,Propidium iodide (PI) staining assay,"2.7 Propidium iodide (PI) staining assay PI staining was performed as previously mentioned (Yao et al., 2011) to identify the possibility of SQEE80 to decrease the proportion of apoptotic sub-G1 cells in ethanol exposed HepG2 cells. In brief, HepG2 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well and allowed to adhere to each other for 12 h under the condition of 37 °C, 95% humidity, and 5% CO2. Cells were incubated for 24 h with or without SQEE80 (250, 500 μg/mL) in the presence of ethanol (800 mM) and washed in ice cold DPBS followed by centrifugation. Then, cells were fixed with 70% EtOH at 4 °C for 15 min and the cell pellets were re-suspended in PBS contained 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution. After centrifugation, cells were incubated with a solution containing 100 μg/mL of PI (Sigma) and 100 μg/mL of ribonuclease A. After 30 min, the proportion of sub-G1 cell population was assessed using CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA)."
9,Animals,"2.8 Animals C57BL/6 mice of 8–9 week, weighing 20–25 g were purchased from Orientbio, Inc. (Sungnam, Korea). Mice were housed in a well-ventilated room on a 12 h:12 h light: dark cycle under a constant temperature (23 ± 1 °C) and humidity (50 ± 10%), and supplied with an NIH-07 approved diet and water according to the guidelines of Institutional Ethical Committee of Jeju National University. This research was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee of Jeju National University (accreditation No. 2016-0053)."
10,SQEE80 and alcohol administration in vivo,"2.9 SQEE80 and alcohol administration in vivo Binge drinking model was used for in vivo evaluation of SQEE80’s hepatoprotective effect (Song et al., 2006). After trying a series of ethanol concentrations (20, 30, 50, and 60% w/v) (data not shown) at a dose of 5 g/kg body weight (BW), we selected 30% (w/v) ethanol as the most effective concentration to induce hepatotoxicity. Mice were divided into four groups, (1) healthy control group, (2) ethanol stimulation group (EtOH 5 g/kg BW only), (3) low-dose treatment group (EtOH (5 g/kg BW) plus SQEE80 (10 mg/kg BW)) (4) high-dose treatment group (EtOH (5 g/kg BW) plus SQEE80 (100 mg/kg BW)],)), and were treated respectively as follows: mice in ethanol stimulation group received EtOH 5 g/kg BW orally through gavage in every 12 h for a total of 3 doses; mice in low-/high-dose treatment groups received EtOH and SQEE80 simultaneously in respective concentrations; mice in healthy control group received DPBS. Mice were sacrificed at 4 h after final dose, and blood and liver samples were collected. We repeated experiments two times with 3–4 mice in each treatment group separately."
11,Tissue processing and hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&E) staining,"2.10 Tissue processing and hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&E) staining Mice liver tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin immediately after sacrifice. Fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin wax and sliced into 3 μm thickness sections. Tissue sections were mounted on glass slides and stained with H&E (Sigma-Aldrich). Stained sections were observed under a fluorescent microscope and images of representative section areas were obtained using Olympus DP-72 microscope camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan)."
12,Measurement of serum ethanol content,"2.11 Measurement of serum ethanol content Mouse blood samples were collected via cardiac puncture under diethyl ether anesthesia using a heparinized syringe and centrifuged in 1200 rpm for 10 min to separate serum. The serum ethanol content was determined by using respective ethanol assay kit (Megazyme International Ireland, Bray, Co., Wicklow, Ireland) according to manufacturer’s instructions."
13,Lipid peroxidation assay in liver,"2.12 Lipid peroxidation assay in liver SQEE80’s inhibitory potential against lipid peroxidation was measured as previously described with minor modifications (Patro et al., 2002). Liver tissues were homogenized using taco™Prep bead beater (GeneReach Biotechnology Co., Taichung city, Taiwan) in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris; pH 8.0) with protease inhibitors (2 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM PMSF, 10 μg/mL aprotinin, 10 μg/mL leupeptin). Resulting homogenates were centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min at 4 °C and protein concentration of the supernatant was measured by using Bradford protein assay method. Proteins were mixed with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and incubated in ice for 10 min. After centrifuging at 2000 g for 15 min at 4 °C, 0.67% (w/v) thiobarbituric acid (TBA, 0.67% (w/v) solution in 50 mM TBA) was added to equal volume of supernatant and heated at 100 °C for 10 min. After cooling, the supernatant was separated by centrifugation at 1000 g for 10 min at 4 °C and absorbance of supernatant was measured at the wavelength of 532 nm using an ELISA plate reader. Standard curve of malondialdehyde (MDA) was used to acquire the formation of MDA-equivalents in liver tissues."
14,Measurement of GSH level in liver,"2.13 Measurement of GSH level in liver The level of GSH, an important anti-oxidant intra-cellular thiol capable of defending cellular components against oxidative stress in mammalian cells, in liver tissue was assayed using a commercially available colorimetric assay kit (Glutathione colorimetric assay kit, Bio vision, Milpitas, CA, USA). First, liver tissues were homogenized in 0.4 mL of GSH buffer and 5% sulfosalicylic acid was added to each sample to remove protein or thiols. Following the manufacturer’s instruction, each sample’s GSH concentration was determined using the generated GSH standard curve."
15,Immunohistochemical staining,"2.14 Immunohistochemical staining Liver tissue sections embedded in paraffin wax were deparaffinized in a series of xylene solutions and rehydrated in graded ethanol solution. Tissue sections were, then, heated in sodium citrate buffer (pH 6) for 20 min and immersed in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide solution in distilled water in order to block the endogenous peroxide activity. Nonspecific bindings were blocked by incubating tissues with goat serum for 30 min. Then tissues were reacted with primary anti-CYP2E1 enzyme (1:500, Millipore, Temecula, CA) antibody overnight at 4 °C and biotinylated anti-rabbit serum for 45 min. Avidin-biotin complex was formed using HRP-labeled Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector) and HRP binding sites were explored with 3, 3′-diaminbenzidine (DAB, Vector) and counterstained with hematoxylin. Negative controls of anti-CYP2E1 enzyme was obtained by replacing primary antibody with rabbit IgG, polyclonal isotype - control (1:500, abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). Images of at least three portions of each section from each animal (two to three sections per each mouse) were obtained using Olympus DP-72 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and quantitative analysis of positively stained cells was performed using ImageJ 1.46 software."
16,Statistical analysis,2.15 Statistical analysis Data were presented as the mean ± S.E.M. for each group. Statistical analysis was performed by using Student’s t-test for two group comparisons or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s multiple comparison correction for multi-group comparisons. P < 0.05 was considered significant in this study.
17,Results,
18,Effect of SQE on HepG2 cell viability,"3.1 Effect of SQE on HepG2 cell viability Cytotoxicity of different SQEs (SQEDW, SQEE20, SQEE40, SQEE60, and SQEE80) on HepG2 cells was examined by using MTT assay (Table 1 ). Viable cell percentage decreased when treated with SQEDW, SQEE20, and SQEE40 in both 24 h and 48 h incubation. However, SQEE60 did not show any significant change in cell viability even at the highest concentration tested (1000 cells μg/mL) in 24 and 48 h incubation. Interestingly, cell viability increased in SQEE80 (0–1000 μg/mL) treated cells after 24 h incubation at high concentrations of SQEE80 compared to untreated control: by 10% at 250 μg/mL, by 20% at 500 μg/mL, and by 18% at 1000 μg/mL (p < 0.05) compared to untreated control. The colony forming assay that measures cell proliferation and bears more direct connection to cell viability produced more pronounced results (Fig. 1 A). As in MTT assay, the relative colony number showed a decreasing pattern in SQEDW, SQEE20, SQEE40, and SQEE60, but it increased dose dependently in SQEE80 at high concentrations compared to untreated control: by 42% at 125 μg/mL, by 68% at 250 μg/mL, by 58% at 500 μg/mL, and by 68% at 1000 μg/mL (p < 0.05; Fig. 1A and B). These results signify that SQEs from DW and lower EtOH concentrations (20–60%) are not potent in enhancing cell viability of HepG2 cells while SQE from 80% EtOH (SQEE80) is significantly beneficial on HepG2 cell survival."
19,Cytoprotective effect of SQE against alcohol-induced toxicity,"3.2 Cytoprotective effect of SQE against alcohol-induced toxicity As we revealed in our previous study (Ra et al., 2017), the viability of EtOH exposed (24 h) HepG2 cells is significantly reduced at EtOH concentrations higher than 400 mM (viability reduction by 17% at 400 mM, by 25.5% at 800 mM, and by 37.4% at 1600 mM). To induce significant toxicity without causing too much damage, we exposed HepG2 cells to 800 mM EtOH in this study. Cytoprotective effect of different SQEs (SQEDW, SQEE20, SQEE40, SQEE60, and SQEE80) was examined in ethanol-stimulated HepG2 cells by using MTT assay (Table 2 ) and colony forming assay (Fig. 2 ). In MTT assay, we observed significant reduction of cell viability in cells exposed to EtOH at 24 h (19–22% reduction) and 48 h (24–30% reduction) compared to untreated control. Also, none of SQEDW, SQEE20, and SQEE40 showed protective effect against alcohol-induced cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells. But, SQEE60 increased the viable cell population by 18.2% at 500 μg/mL (P < 0.05) and significant cell viability increase was also observed in a wide range of concentrations for SQEE80 treatment (by 7%, 5.6%, 5.2% at 125, 250, 500 μg/mL, respectively; p < 0.05) compared to EtOH only treated group in 24 h incubation. These results suggest that although SQEDW, SQEE20, and SQEE40 did not have cytoprotective effect against alcohol-induced cytotoxicity and SQEE60 exhibited cytoprotective effect only at a specific concentration (500 μg/mL), SQEE80 showed cytoprotective effect over wider concentrations (125, 250, and 500 μg/mL) against alcohol-induced cytotoxicity of HepG2 cells in 24 h incubation and hence more potent. In the colony forming assay (Fig. 2A), SQEDW, SQEE20, SQEE40, and SQEE60 did not show protective effect on EtOH stimulated HepG2 cells, but SQEE80 showed a dose dependent increase in relative colony numbers (by 1.7 fold at 62.5 μg/mL, by 1.9 fold at 125 μg/mL, by 2 fold at 500 μg/mL and 1000 μg/mL; p < 0.05) compared to untreated control (Fig. 2A, B). These results clearly indicate that SQEE80 (62.5–1000 μg/mL) exhibited cytoprotective effect against EtOH induced cell death, which may be beneficial to long term hepatic damage due to ethanol. Considering the cell viability and cytoprotective potential, we selected the SQEE80 as the most effective extract against alcohol-induced toxicity and retained for further investigation."
20,Effect of SQEE80 on ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) production,"3.3 Effect of SQEE80 on ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) production The level of intracellular ROS production was measured by DCF-DA assay (Fig. 3 A). ROS production was increased by 35% (p < 0.005) in HepG2 cells stimulated by ethanol alone compared to untreated control group, but HepG2 cells treated with SQEE80 without ethanol stimulation did not show any change of ROS production compared to untreated control. Remarkably, however, ROS production was decreased in ethanol stimulated HepG2 cells treated with SQEE80 compared to those without SQEE80 treatment. The reduction of ROS production was 22.9% (p < 0.05) and 37.7% (p < 0.05) with 250 μg/mL and 500 μg/mL of SQEE80 treatments, respectively. Ethanol stimulation also increased the NO production in HepG2 cells by 2.1 fold but SQEE80 exposure without ethanol stimulation did not make significant change in NO production compared to untreated control. However, ethanol stimulated HepG2 cells treated with SQEE80 showed decrease in the NO production (by 56.0% in 250 μg/mL and 30.6% in 500 μg/mL, respectively) compared to those without SQEE80 treatment (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that SQEE80 treatment has the potential to reduce ROS and RNS production in HepG2 cells under ethanol stimulation."
21,Effect of SQEE80 on activation of antioxidant enzymes in HepG2 cells,"3.4 Effect of SQEE80 on activation of antioxidant enzymes in HepG2 cells We assessed the effect of ethanol and SQEE80 on the activity of antioxidant enzyme catalase and GPX-1 in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4 ). In HepG2 cells stimulated by ethanol alone, catalase activity was decreased by 1.4 fold (p < 0.05) compared to untreated control but it was increased by 1.6 and 1.9 fold when HepG2 cells were treated with 250 μg/mL (p < 0.05) and 500 μg/mL (p < 0.05) SQEE80 without ethanol stimulation, respectively. Furthermore, SQEE80 treatment with 250 μg/mL (p < 0.05) significantly increased the activity of catalase by 1.7 fold even in ethanol stimulated HepG2 cells compared to those without SQEE80 treatment (Fig. 4A and B). Although the activity of GPX-1 was not significantly affected in ethanol stimulated HepG2 cells compared to untreated control, it increased significantly by 6 and 11 folds (both p < 0.05) compared to untreated control when treated with 250 and 500 μg/mL of SQEE80 without ethanol stimulation, respectively. More importantly, treatment with both doses of SQEE80 in ethanol stimulated cells increased the hepatic GPX-1 activity significantly (p < 0.05) compared to cells without SQEE80 treatment (Fig. 4A and C). Staining of catalase (Fig. 4D) showed a band at 82 kDa, much higher than the expected size at 64 kDa, while GPX-1 (Fig. 4E) showed a band at 25 kDa (expected size at 24 kDa) and β-actin (Fig. 4F) showed a band at 40 kDa (expected size 42 kDa) in mouse liver tissue. The activation of antioxidant enzymes by SQEE80 may be responsible for decreasing ROS production in ethanol stimulated HepG2 cells."
22,Effect of SQEE80 on decreasing apoptotic DNA formation in alcohol-induced HepG2 cells,"3.5 Effect of SQEE80 on decreasing apoptotic DNA formation in alcohol-induced HepG2 cells PI staining assay was performed to evaluate whether SQEE80 down-regulated the amount of sub-G1 cell population in ethanol stimulated HepG2 cells. As shown in Fig. 5 A and B, formation of apoptotic DNA in sub-G1 group was significantly increased (by 7 fold; p < 0.05) in ethanol stimulated cells (6.17%) compared to untreated control (0.84%). However, SQEE80 treatments (250 and 500 μg/mL) decreased the apoptotic DNA in sub-G1 group in ethanol stimulated cells by 62.2% and 55.5% compared to those without SQEE80 treatment, respectively. Though seemed marginal, the 6% apoptosis of HepG2 cells occurred in a short period of time (24 h) after EtOH exposure could, in fact, lead to substantial cell mass loss if prolonged. The results suggest SQEE80’s potential in reducing alcohol-induced apoptosis and preserving cell mass."
23,Effect of SQEE80 on macroscopic and histological changes in liver,"3.6 Effect of SQEE80 on macroscopic and histological changes in liver Binge model of alcohol consumption was used in this study to mimic human acute liver injury. Representative macroscopic views and histopathological changes of livers in each group are indicated in Fig. 6 . Alcohol-stimulated group livers (Fig. 6B–D) were clearly light tinged compared to that of healthy control (Fig. 6A). Histological analysis of liver tissues showed severe micro vesicular steatosis with high number of lipid droplets in ethanol stimulation group. Furthermore, we observed loss of cellular boundaries and ballooning degeneration in ethanol stimulation group (Fig. 6F and J) compared to healthy control (Fig. 6E and I). Pathologically, ballooning of hepatocytes involved not only swelling and vacuolation but also change of cellular structure. However, SQEE80 treatment attenuated above mentioned histological changes with increasing concentrations of SQEE80 (10 mg/kg BW (Fig. 6G and K) and 100 mg/kg BW (Fig. 6H and L), respectively). Most clear attenuation was observed in high-dose treatment group. Histological observation clearly unveiled the significance of SQEE80 in relieving alcohol-induced liver damage by reducing areas of micro vesicular steatosis, ballooning degeneration, and sinusoidal dilation."
24,"Effect of SQEE80 on serum ethanol content, lipid peroxidation, and reduced GSH levels in liver","3.7 Effect of SQEE80 on serum ethanol content, lipid peroxidation, and reduced GSH levels in liver To determine the protective effect of SQEE80, we also measured the serum ethanol content after binge administration of ethanol. As shown in Fig. 7 A, we observed 3.3 fold increase of serum ethanol content in the ethanol stimulation group compared to healthy control group (p < 0.005), but this escalation was depressed by 56.1% (p = 0.055) in low-dose treatment group and by 56.9% (p < 0.05) in high-dose treatment group, respectively, compared to ethanol stimulation group. The results interestingly suggest SQEE80’s protective effect of decreasing the alcohol-induced serum ethanol content. The TBARS assay was performed to study SQEE80’s capacity to alter the alcohol-induced lipid peroxidation in mouse liver (Fig. 7B). Our results revealed higher TBARS formation in ethanol stimulation group compared to healthy control (by 1. 8 fold). But the TBARS formation was decreased by 0. 6 fold in low-dose treatment group and by 0. 7 fold in high-dose treatment group, respectively. The effect of SQEE80 on alcohol-induced GSH level is shown in Fig. 7C. Ethanol stimulation significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the expression of non-enzymatic antioxidant GSH in liver by 73.5% compared to healthy control group. Interestingly, however, the suppressed glutathione level was increased by 1.5 fold in low-dose treatment group and by 3.2 fold (p < 0.05) in high-dose treatment group compared to ethanol stimulation group. These results further suggest the efficacy of SQEE80 in decreasing the alcohol-induced ROS."
25,Effect of SQEE80 on expression of CYP2E1 in ethanol exposed liver,"3.8 Effect of SQEE80 on expression of CYP2E1 in ethanol exposed liver Exposure to ethanol is considered to increase the hepatic CYP2E1 at centrilobular region and immunohistochemical analysis was performed to evaluate the intensity of CYP2E1 expression. Our results exhibited high intensity expression of CYP2E1 in ethanol stimulation group as expected (Fig. 8 B and G) compared to healthy control group (Fig. 8A and F) whereas SQEE80 treatment of ethanol stimulated group mice exhibited slightly mitigated expression in low-dose (Fig. 8C and H) and high-dose treatment groups (Fig. 8D and I), respectively. There was no positive staining in the negative control (Fig. 8E and J). As indicated in Fig. 8K, this visual observation was directly confirmed in the quantitative analysis. The number of CYP2E1 positive cells was increased (p < 0.005) by 70.4% in ethanol stimulation group compared to healthy control. More importantly, the number of CYP2E1 positive cells in ethanol stimulation group was decreased by 17.2–21.3% when 10 mg/kg BW (p < 0.05) or 100 mg/kg BW (p < 0.05) of SQEE80 was treated, respectively. Staining of CYP2E1 (Fig. 8L) showed a band at 60 kDa, (expected size at 64 kDa). In parallel, we performed western blot to validate the expression of CYP2E1 in liver tissue homogenates. As shown in Fig. 8M and N, the expression of CYP2E1, observed largely in centrilobular region of liver, was increased significantly by 66% (p < 0.05) in ethanol stimulation group compared to healthy control. Consistent with immunohistochemical results, the expression of CYP2E1 was decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in low-dose treatment (by 53.3%) and high-dose treatment groups (by 59.6%), respectively, compared to ethanol stimulation group. These results imply SQEE80 has the potential to suppress the expression of metabolic enzyme CYP2E1 and therapeutic utility in alcohol-induced liver damage."
26,Discussion,"Oxidative stress is a fundamental workhorse in ALD and exploring antioxidants to ameliorate detrimental effects of it and to prevent ethanol hepatotoxicity is a rational strategy (Senthil Kumar et al., 2012). In the present study, we used in vitro and in vivo models of alcohol toxicity including HepG2 cells and binge mouse model to investigate the hepatoprotective effect of extracts of Sasa quelpaertensis Nakai Leaf, an edible bamboo mainly cultivated in Jeju Island, South Korea. In the current study, we disclosed that SQE is not toxic to HepG2 cells at 24 h incubation even at sufficiently high doses and adopted this incubation time for subsequent experiments. We also conducted a preliminary study with a series of ethanol concentrations and determined to use 800 mM ethanol to induce cytotoxicity without too much damage on HepG2 cells (data not shown). Determining the ethanol concentration and exposure time, we further investigated the preventive potential of SQEE80 against alcohol-induced oxidative stress in HepG2 cells by using various concentrations of SQEE80 and determined to use 250 and 500 μg/mL for further experiments. Ethanol metabolism results in increased production of ROS, which plays a major role in development of alcohol liver damage. ROS are reactive molecules that have the ability to take electrons from other molecules (Balasubramaniyan et al., 2007) and damage lipid, protein, and DNA in the cell (Schieber and Chandel, 2014). Accumulation of ROS overwhelms cell’s natural antioxidant protection and develops oxidative stress which can be directly assayed by DCF-DA assay (Wang and Joseph, 1999). Our results showed a marked increase of ROS in ethanol stimulated cells compared to untreated control, but SQEE80 treatment decreased the ROS production with increasing concentrations of SQEE80 suggesting SQEE80’s capacity to decrease the alcohol-induced oxidative stress in HepG2 cells. When we further evaluated the effect of alcohol-induced oxidative stress on the function of crucial antioxidant enzyme catalase and GPX-1 in oxidative stress, exposure to SQEE80 without alcohol stimulation significantly increased the expression of catalases (250 μg/mL) and GPX-1 (250 and 500 μg/mL) in HepG2 cells. These results suggest SQEE80 can attenuate the alcohol-induced oxidative stress by promoting the activity of antioxidant enzyme catalase and GPX-1. Apart from ROS, RNS formed in ethanol metabolism are also involved in alcohol-induced oxidative stress with the possibility of decreasing ethanol metabolizing enzyme activity and causing alcohol-induced liver damages (Deng and Deitrich, 2007). Our results indicate that the production of NO was increased in ethanol stimulation group compared to untreated control though not significant and SQEE80 treatment decreased the production of NO in ethanol stimulated HepG2 cells. It is identified that the oxidative stress and ROS produced through ethanol metabolism damage mitochondria by altering mitochondrial membrane potential and/or permeability, eventually leading to cell death (McVicker et al., 2007). Therefore, oxidative stress induced cell death signifies a new milestone in developing novel therapeutic targets. In the present study, we observed a significant increase in cell death (sub-G1 phase) in ethanol stimulation group and SQEE80 treatment significantly decreased it in ethanol stimulated HepG2 cells compared to cells without treatment possibly due to its potential to reduce the alcohol-induced ROS production. Results of HepG2 cell model confirm the significance of SQEE80 as a putative hepatoprotective agent against alcohol-induced oxidative stress. Liver is the organ where 90% of ethanol is metabolized and most of alcohol-induced oxidative damage accumulates (Louvet and Mathurin, 2015). In the slightly modified binge model used here, ethanol challenged mouse liver showed a light tinged appearance compared to healthy control and severe micro vesicular steatosis, loss of cellular boundaries, ballooning degeneration, and sinusoidal dilation, which were attenuated in SQEE80 treatment particularly at high concentration (100 mg/kg BW). These results pinpoint that SQEE80 treatment is effective in improving the alcohol-induced histopathological changes in liver and emphasize the validity of SQEE80 as a component in attenuating alcohol-induced oxidative stress in human liver. Interestingly, the beneficial effect of 30% EtOH extract of S. quelpaertensis leaves was previously identified as an effective hepatoprotective agent against alcohol toxicity via its potential in reducing serum ALT and AST, lipid peroxidation, and histological changes (Lee et al., 2008). But, in this study, we uncovered that SQEE80 is superior to other SQEs (SQEDW, SQEE20, SQEE40, and SQEE60) in alleviating alcohol-induced oxidative stress. Our findings agree with the results of recent studies based on flaxseed (Anwar and Przybylski, 2012) and dropwort (Choi et al., 2011) where 80% EtOH extraction resulted in higher amount of flavonoids and antioxidant capacity. Similarly, 80% EtOH extract of Pseudosasa japonica bamboo leaves was revealed to possess antioxidant capacity, which was considered to be related to the high level of polyphenols contained (You et al., 2006). We showed that SQEE80’s antioxidant effect could decrease the alcohol-induced oxidative stress, which suggests the possibility of SQEE80 on creating enhanced antioxidant effect and mitigating the alcohol-induced oxidative stress. According to our previous study, the high flavonoid and phenol content of SQEE80 was responsible for observed high 1, 1-diphenly-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity and 2, 2′-azino-di-2-ethyl-benzthiazoline sulphonate (ABTS) radical scavenging activity devoted for SHE’s antioxidant properties (Ra et al., 2017). Blood ethanol content is a major parameter which determines the amount of ethanol circulating to the metabolizing organs such as liver (Hernandez and Lopez-Sanchez, 2016) and is reported to cause considerable liver injury at high concentrations (Bertola et al., 2013). Binge drinking, in particular, can pump up blood ethanol concentration to a high level fast and poses as a more serious health hazard. US National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholismdefines binge drinking as a pattern of drinking that can increase blood ethanol content more than 0.08% (80 mM) for humans (Shukla Shivendra et al., 2013). When we measured the ethanol content in mouse serum, the level we observed in ethanol stimulation group of binge alcohol model (95.4 mM) was comparable to the human binge drinking as reported previously (Bertola et al., 2013), validating the use of binge mouse model simulating as a surrogate of human binge drinking and acute alcohol abuse. But SQEE80 (10 and 100 mg/kg BW) treatment decreased the serum ethanol content significantly. Furthermore, serum ethanol content has been found to be associated with the degree of histopathlogical changes observed in the current study, where histopathological changes were decreased when serum ethanol content was reduced with SQEE80 treatment. This again supports SQEE80’s potential to be a hepatoprotective therapeutic agent against alcohol-induced oxidative damage. It has been known that hepatic lipid peroxidation is associated with alcohol-induced oxidative stress (Louvet and Mathurin, 2015) and, according to previous reports, binge ethanol induction significantly increases the lipid peroxidation in liver (Song et al., 2006). Though not significant, our data also showed increased lipid peroxidation in ethanol stimulation group whereas a decreasing pattern of lipid peroxidation was observed when treated with increasing concentrations of SQEE80. This also confirms the possibility of SQEE80 in decreasing alcohol-induced oxidative stress in liver. CYP2E1 is in the central pathway of ethanol metabolism which generates ROS such as superoxide anion radical and hydrogen peroxide (Lu and Cederbaum, 2008) and can be consider as a major contributor in alcohol-induced oxidative stress. Our data showed that binge ethanol induction significantly increased the CYP2E1 expression, but SQEE80 treatment decreased the expression of CYP2E1, suggesting that the SQEE80 attenuated oxidative stress by decreasing the expression of CYP2E1. As a consequence we focused on antioxidants’ protective role against alcohol-induced adverse effects of ROS. The expression of main antioxidant GSH was significantly decreased in ethanol stimulation group, reflecting the depletion of GSH by ethanol-induced ROS production increase. In this study, we elucidated that SQEE80 dose dependently increased the expression of non-enzymatic antioxidant GSH and SQEE80’s potential to reduce oxidative damage of ethanol stimulated liver via CYP2E1 reduction by promoting GSH expression. Furthermore, the SQEE80’s potential in increasing the expression of ethanol metabolizing enzyme catalase can also be responsible for decreasing the serum ethanol content."
27,Conclusion,"Current study reports the potent hepatoprotective effect of SQEE80 against acute alcohol consumption. Such effect is manifested by attenuating the oxidative stress which affects when prolonged. SQEE80 decreases CYP2E1 expression, lipid peroxidation, and GSH level. It enhances the expression of antioxidant enzyme catalases and GPX-1. Histopathological changes due to prolonged/acute ethanol metabolism is also mitigated by SQEE80 treatment. Hence, developing natural product based therapeutic agents is of high interest in managing ALD. Concequently our results suggest the possibility of SQEE80 as a potential hepatoprotective natural material and warrants further investigation."
