0,Introduction,"The global warming as a result of anthropogenic emissions of CO2 is by far the greatest challenge of mankind. In 2018, emissions of carbon dioxide from anthropic sources of combustion reached the historic value of 33.1 GtCO2 [1]. At this point, without efficient abatement measures and actions, the goals established by the Paris agreement [2] will be virtually impossible to attain. Therefore, a variety of efforts has been placed into developing economically feasible strategies to enable the capture of CO2. This concept can be achieved by following two main strategies: Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) or Carbon Capture Utilization (CCU). The latter is a rather novel concept of carbon footprint reduction and it is based on converting carbon dioxide into fuel or valuable chemicals. Several strategies have been proposed to accomplish this. They can be chemical, electrochemical, photochemical or biochemical catalytic processes [3–11]. A myriad of products can be obtained from CO2 such as organic or inorganic carbonates, amides, urea, salicylic acid, syngas, fuel hydrocarbons or fuel alcohols [12]. Despite the numerous catalytic concepts developed for the valorisation of CO2, heterogeneous catalysis has been one of the most studied strategies for that purpose, especially due to the industrial know-how of operation and scale-up of such catalytic processes. Methanol (CH3OH) is considered one of the most promising platform molecules obtainable directly from CO2, since it can be integrated in numerous upgrading processes, making a closed carbon cycle economy possible [13]. The direct substitution of petroleum based fuels by methanol in internal combustion engines has also been shown to be feasible [14,15]. Moreover, unlike CO2 derived methanol, the use of fossil fuels causes urban air pollution, which leads to an increase in the occurrence of respiratory diseases and deaths from cardiovascular and respiratory ailments due to alveolar inflammation, as demonstrated by epidemiological studies [16]. Hence, a methanol economy can aid the improvement of urban pollution and public health, as well as help mitigating the greenhouse effect, if it is derived from CO2. Methanol consumption and demand has been growing intensely worldwide, and that growing trend is even more evident in China, where the government has set goals to tackle air pollution [17]. In light of this context, methanol as fuel or platform molecule is rising as one of the most promising energetic transition solutions. Therefore, the development of novel catalytic materials can be focused on accomplishing the clean and selective production of methanol from CO2. So far, the only large-scale process of CO2 conversion into methanol is the Vulcanol® process, developed by Carbon Recycling International at the George Olah plant in Iceland. This process uses copper oxide (CuO), zinc oxide (ZnO) and/or aluminium oxide (Al2O3) as heterogeneous catalysts [18]. Various studies have been performed in order to improve the activity of the CuO/ZnO catalysts by modifying or combining the oxides used to support Cu. In one example, a zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) support was added for its lower affinity towards water and showed better activity than other supports due to its synergy with Cu. With these improvements, a methanol selectivity of 45.8% was achieved at 240 °C [19]. Also with a CuO/ZnO/ZrO2 catalyst, a high selectivity of 97% towards methanol was reported by Arena et al., in a pressurized flow process at 50 bar and 180 °C, although CO2 conversion was merely 2.7% [20]. Notwithstanding the efforts towards improvement of catalyst support, Cu based catalysts have historically and currently carried the disadvantage of significant carbon monoxide (CO) formation and low methanol selectivity at higher conversion rates [21–23]. There was one variable which has enabled the classic CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst to present a 98% selectivity towards methanol whilst still converting 95% of CO2, which was the CO2/H2 molar ratio of 1/10 and pressure of 360 bar [24]. Despite the great results observed at these conditions, hydrogen gas has been shown to be the main economic cost at an industrial process of CO2 conversion into methanol [25], even if H2 is produced from water electrolysis and used in a 1/3 ratio [26], meaning a process employing a 1/10 ratio of CO2 to H2 would hardly be economically feasible. Thus, different research groups aim to develop a process to selectively hydrogenate CO2 into methanol, with high CO2 conversion rates. Although the economic cost of the metals involved in the catalyst is of great importance to the feasibility of any industrial process, catalysts made of cheaper metals such as copper or zinc have an important drawback, which is their incompatibility with water or even moisture present in the gas mixture - they are deactivated if in contact with water, and over high CO2 partial pressures [27]. The hydrogenation of CO2 into methanol has also been catalysed by noble metals, but even then, selectivity remains an issue - particularly at CO2 conversion rates higher than 10% - with the use of noble metals commonly active on hydrogenations, such as Pd, Pt, Ir, Rh or Ag either leading to CO [28–30] or methane (CH4) as the main product [31–35]. A few decades ago, rhenium on cerium oxide (Re/CeO2) and rhenium on zirconium dioxide (Re/ZrO2) were used in the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol by Hattori et al., although the major products were in fact CO and CH4, respectively [36]. Supported rhenium catalysts have also been tested in the hydrogenolysis of formic esters to methanol, wherein titanium dioxide (TiO2) had the greatest selectivity towards methanol [37]. Rhenium catalysts have often been studied in the hydrogenation of carbonyl and carboxylic groups, both in homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, showing great results and selectivity towards the hydroxyl group [38–43]. Those evidences suggest that rhenium oxide supported on titanium dioxide (ReOx/TiO2) could perform well as a catalyst for the hydrogenation of CO2 into methanol. In fact, shortly before this work was completed, Ting et al. have published their work with conversion of CO2 into methanol over a Re/TiO2 catalyst in a batch process, at 150 °C, CO2/H2 ratio of 1/5, total pressure of 60 bar, in 1,4-dioxane as solvent, over a 24 h reaction period. In those conditions, a turn-over-number (TON) of 44 was obtained, with a selectivity of 82% towards methanol and with carbon monoxide being the secondary product [44]. Employing high pressures and temperatures has been one of the most successful approaches to enhance methanol selectivity. These new attempts are based on pushing the thermodynamic equilibrium by removing the products from the gas mixture due to condensation of water and methanol. Nonetheless, these processes still struggle with selectivity, mainly at higher CO2 conversion rates [45–47]. The supercritical condition is attained by carbon dioxide above P = 74 bar and T = 31 °C [48]. The utilization of supercritical carbon dioxide for its hydrogenation reaction has been studied by Evdokimenko et al. [49] and Bogdan et al. [50], who have respectively reported the hydrogenation of CO2 into carbon monoxide and methane in supercritical conditions using different catalysts. Nonetheless, neither author has studied the same reaction below or near the mixture’s critical point, so it was not possible to evaluate the beneficial effect of the supercritical conditions on conversion rate or selectivity. Kommoß et al. [46] have performed the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol using a CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst at 150 bar and analysed the possibility of in situ phase separation of reaction products within the reactor, in order to shift the thermodynamic equilibrium by removing methanol. Their density measurements of H2/CO2 mixtures show that an increase in molar ratio of H2/CO2 beyond 1/1 leads to a dramatic decrease of the mixture density, when pressure is maintained at 150 bar. At these conditions, temperature variations from 200 °C up to 400 °C had a negligible effect on mixture density. Additionally, these authors have also performed a view cell experiment in order to analyse phase separation and have observed that, for a mixture of H2−CO2−CH3OH−H2O (62:13:10:15), it occurs at 206 °C for a pressure of 150 bar. The latest works point to the fact that achieving high conversion and selectivity rates requires a judicious choice of reaction conditions, in order to establish an ideal correlation between phase equilibria and CO2 conversion. It is noteworthy that an increase in temperature helps maintaining a homogeneous system within the reactor at high pressures, but it usually produces a negative impact on reaction selectivity. Furthermore, the use of supercritical fluids, which are known to combine the great diffusibility of gases with the high density of liquids, leads to a high space-time yield, due to a higher density of gaseous reactants being in contact with the catalyst at a given residence time, and it is also an essential condition not only to process large amounts of CO2, but also because most of the CO2 obtained from CCS processes is compressed to high pressures. Herein we report a high-pressure continuous supercritical flow process with a highly selective and efficient ReOx/TiO2 catalyst for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol, designed to maximize the conversion rate without compromising selectivity or phase homogeneity. The high pressure allows this system to convert a large amount of CO2 almost exclusively into methanol, since at 200 °C methanol selectivity was 98% and CO2 conversion was 18%. To our knowledge, this is the best combination of methanol selectivity and CO2 conversion rate reported in literature thus far, since other processes employing CO2/H2 ratios of 1/4 or higher either need to compromise conversion rates in order to increase selectivity or the opposite."
1,Experimental section,

Hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide were acquired from Special Gases, at 99.5% purity. Carbon monoxide and methane analytical standards were acquired from White Martins at 99.99% purity. Analytical standards for methanol (CH3OH), ethanol (C2H5OH) and 2-propanol (C3H7OH) were acquired from Sigma Aldrich at 99.999% purity. All single-way and double-way valves were purchased to high-pressure company (HIP, USA). All of the reactors used were produced in house using stainless steel 316L and Swagelok® fittings."
3,Catalyst synthesis,"2.2 Catalyst synthesis The ReOx/TiO2 was obtained from rhenium precursor Re2O7, which was dissolved in water, in sufficient amount to yield 6% in mass to the TiO2 P25 support. A wet impregnation method was employed, and the catalyst was then dried at 120 °C in air. The remaining evaluated catalysts ReOx/SiO2, ReOx/Al2O3, Ir/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 were synthesized in analogous methods of wet impregnation of their inorganic precursors Re2O7.xH2O, IrCl3.xH2O and PdCl2 on the corresponding support. The catalysts were all pre-reduced in situ at 250 °C under 1 mL min−1 H2 at 20 bar for 1 h previously to all catalytic tests."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Surface area and pore volume of the catalyst before and after reduction with H2 were measured by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms with a Nova 1200e surface area analyser from Quantachrome. Samples were pre-treated under vacuum at 300 °C for 3 h. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the catalyst after thermal reduction with H2 were obtained with a Rigaku Miniflex diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation, 40 kV tension and 30 mA current, with a step of 2θ of 0.02° at 2°/min. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were performed using a conventional XPS instrument (Scienta Omicron ESCA+) with a high-performance hemispheric analyser (EAC2000) using monochromatic Al Kα (hν =1486.6 eV) radiation as the excitation source. The XPS high-resolution spectra were recorded at a constant pass energy of 50 eV with a 0.05 eV per step. Peak fitting of the high-resolution spectra was processed using the CasaXPS software (Casa Software Ltd). Rhenium percentages on the catalyst were evaluated by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) in a Spectro Arcos spectrometer, samples were previously digested by heating in HNO3:HCl 1:3. Transmission electron microscopy images were acquired at on a JEOL 2100 F microscope, operating at 200 kV of acceleration voltage with a field emission gun. The images were acquired in conventional TEM and Scanning-TEM (STEM), to increase contrast between ReOx and TiO2. The catalyst was previously reduced under H2 at 250 °C and 20 bar, in order to achieve similar dispersions to the ones in the catalytic tests. Afterwards, the solid was dispersed in isopropanol with sonication, and dripped onto an ultrathin carbon film coated Cu grid (Ted Pella). STEM images were acquired by high-angle annular dark field detector with a spot size of 1 nm; histogram of nanoparticle size distribution was evaluated through these images by measuring particles and fitting the histogram with a log-normal function. Temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was performed in a CatLab microreactor coupled with a mass spectrometer, both from Hiden Analytical. The catalyst was pre-treated at 100 °C for 30 min under 100 mL min−1 Ar, then measured from 50 to 950 °C, at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, under 30 mL min−1 Ar and 1 mL min−1 H2. Infrared (IR) spectrometry studies were performed in a Shimadzu IR Prestige 21 spectrometer, measuring spectra of 64 scans at a spectral resolution of 4 cm−1. A sample of 20 mg of ReOx/TiO2 was pressed into a pellet and placed into a Specac IR high-temperature transmission cell. The catalyst was pre-treated at 250 °C under a flow of 10 mL min−1 H2 and 50 mL min−1 argon (Ar) prior to measurements. The reaction was studied by flowing 10 mL min−1 of CO2 and 30 mLmin−1 of H2 in 50 mL min−1 of Ar, at ambient pressure and at several temperatures."
5,Catalytic tests,"2.4 Catalytic tests 2.4.1 Catalyst screening in batch reactions In order to evaluate the activity and selectivity of prospective catalysts, 10 mg of catalyst was added to a 10 mL stainless steel reactor manufactured in house. The reactor was degassed with a flow of 1 mL min−1 of N2 for 5 min, then pressurized with 20 bar of H2 and heated to 250 °C. After a pre-treatment time of 1 h, hydrogen pressure was increased to 50 bar, and CO2 was added until total pressure reached 100 bar. The reaction proceeded for 18 h, after which gaseous products were analysed via Gas Chromatography using a Thermal Conductivity Detector (GC-TCD) and water soluble products (e.g. alcohols) were collected in ultrapure water and analysed via Gas Chromatography using a Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID). 2.4.2 Supercritical flow reactions The supercritical flow reaction system was fed by two gas cylinders of industrial purity (99.5%) hydrogen and carbon dioxide (a) using a 500 mL syringe pump Isco model 500D (b) which pressurized the gas mixture of CO2 and H2 and controlled the flow rate. The reaction mixture was evaluated as described in Section 2.3.3 Analytical methods. The gaseous reaction mixture then flowed through a 1 cm³ (ID: 4.1 mm) high-pressure stainless-steel tubular reactor manufactured in house (c), packed with 290 mg of the ReOx/TiO2 heterogeneous catalyst. The reactor was equipped with a thermostat (Type J, 3 mm x 150 mm) and pressure gauge (NOVUS HUBA 520), and it was heated by a tubular oven (WT industria, Brazil) (d). The pressure was controlled at the desired value with a spring-loaded piston backpressure valve (CITUA, Brazil) (e) installed at the end of the flow system, and a six-way sampling valve (Rheodyne® 7000 L)(f) was used to collect samples and evaluate CO2 hydrogenation under pressure. Samples were acquired every half hour during four hours, both by bubbling the gas mixture in ultrapure water, in order to analyse alcohols, and by collecting the gas in a pressurized vessel, for methane and carbon monoxide analysis. The experimental apparatus is depicted on Scheme 1 . Previously to the reaction, a flow of 1 mL min−1 of H2 was pushed through the reactor at 250 °C in order to pre-reduce the catalyst for 1 h. After each experiment, the system was purged with a flow of H2 of 1 mL min−1, at 250 °C and 20 bar, so as to avoid contaminations from one reaction to the next. 2.4.3 Analytical methods The products collected in water were analysed via GC-FID in a Trace GC from ThermoScientific and in a GC–MS QP5000 from Shimadzu, both equipped with a Stabilwax DA 60mx0.25mmx0.25um capillary column from Restek. Gaseous products were analysed via GC-TCD in a Shimadzu QP2010 equipped with a Carboxen 1010 Plot capillary column 30mx0.53 mm from Supelco. In order to rule out the formation of liquid products that were undetectable by our GC-FID such as formaldehyde and formic acid, samples collected in water were also analysed by HPLC-RID in a Shimadzu chromatographer equipped with a Shodex SH1011 column and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) 0.05% as eluent. A more detailed description of analytical methods can be found on Supplementary Information section A3."
6,Thermodynamic analysis,"2.5 Thermodynamic analysis Equilibrium conversion and product selectivities were estimated using Aspen Plus V.8.8 software. The equilibrium state at any given temperature and pressure of a system with a set of chemical components is obtained by minimizing Gibbs free energy, which was achieved using RGibbs module set for phase and chemical equilibria determination [51]. Usual analysis at RGibbs required only pressure and temperature conditions, without specification of the involved reactions or stoichiometry (although subjected to atom balance constraints). The SRK EOS modified by Mathias [52], using pure and binary interaction parameters as described by Bennekom et al. [53], was used in this study. The reactants and products selected were H2, CO2, CO, CH3OH, CH4 and H2O. Higher alcohols were not analysed due to its negligible production under reaction conditions. After a first run at 200 °C and 100 bar, sensitivity analysis varying temperature (150−250 °C), pressure (1, 40, 80, 100 and 120 bar) and CO2/H2 proceeded. A more detailed description can be found on Supplementary Information section A4.2."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst screening in batch reactions,"3.1 Catalyst screening in batch reactions The first goal of this work was to evaluate what was the most suitable combination between metal and support to address the reduction of carbon dioxide. Five catalysts were prepared and used in batch reactions of CO2 hydrogenation, and the activity and selectivity of those catalysts were analysed (Tables 1 and 2 ). Under batch conditions, the ReOx/TiO2 catalyst yielded the largest methanol space time yield of 328 mmol g−1 h−1, while the ReOx/SiO2 catalyst was far behind with 62 mmol g−1 h−1. The performance of the remaining rhenium, palladium and iridium-based catalysts tested under batch conditions was poor (Table 1). As observed on Table 2, among the catalysts based on rhenium oxide nanoparticles, TiO2 had the greatest selectivity towards methanol, at 96%, with ethanol as the secondary product. The selectivity towards methanol decreased slightly, to 83% and 90% with SiO2 and Al2O3, respectively, and methane emerged as the secondary product - especially on ReOx/SiO2, where methane selectivity was 12%. When varying the active metal, the shift on selectivity was much more expressive. With iridium as active metal, the main product was still methanol, at 54%, and an increase in ethanol selectivity to 6% was observed. Nevertheless, methane selectivity has risen to 31% and carbon monoxide to 9% over Ir/TiO2. Meanwhile, over Pd/TiO2 the major product was carbon monoxide, with 55% selectivity. Methanol was still observed over Pd/TiO2 with 43% selectivity, and methane at 1%. It is also noted that when CO2 hydrogenation was conducted over pure TiO2, only a small amount of carbon monoxide was detected. Therefore, ReOx/TiO2 was chosen as the catalyst to develop a continuous flow process for the reduction of CO2 under supercritical conditions."
9,Catalyst synthesis and characterization,"3.2 Catalyst synthesis and characterization The ReOx/TiO2 catalyst was successfully prepared with no additives and using water as solvent, adhering to the principles of green chemistry [54] and characterized by various techniques. The elemental analysis was performed with ICP-OES and confirmed the calculated amounts of 6.0 wt% rhenium on P25 titanium oxide support. Surface analysis by BET showed surface area of 59.3 m² g−1, a pore size of 8.6 nm and a pore volume of 0.290 cm³ g−1, values which are close to those reported for the unmodified P25 support [55]. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of ReOx/TiO2 can be found on Figure SI 1. The XRD patterns of ReOx/TiO2 are shown in Figure SI 2 and are essentially the same as those seen in commercial TiO2 P25. The reason for the absence of ReOx reflections on XRD might be the size of nanoparticles in the nanocluster range, in contrast with a highly crystalline TiO2 diffraction pattern. Transmission Electron Microscopy images of the pre-reduced catalyst show nanoparticles averaging 1.0 ± 0.3 nm. The TEM images and particle size distribution can be found in Fig. 1 . As observed on the TEM images, the nanoparticles are fairly well distributed on the P25 support, and size distribution is also quite sharp. The characterization techniques show that this catalyst is quite similar in size and particle distribution to other ReOx/TiO2 catalysts in literature, which also show clusters of around 1 nm or less, being highly dispersed on the support [39,42,44,56,57]. Despite the size similarity of the particles, the ReOx/TiO2 reported herein contains more of the highly oxidized species Re7+ and presents no signs of species on oxidation states lower than Re4+. Rhenium species between 4+ and 0, including metallic Re, have been reported by others that employed much higher reduction temperatures of 500 °C or 700 °C [37,39,47]. The H2-TPR of this catalyst (Fig. 1c) reveals that only a small amount of hydrogen is consumed at temperatures lower than 300 °C, suggesting that even at the highest employed temperature of 250 °C, the oxidation state of rhenium is not significantly reduced. Since reaction temperatures of 150, 200 and 250 °C were studied, a pre-treatment step of 250 °C was performed before each experiment in order to equalize the oxidation state of ReOx/TiO2 and thus ensure that any effects on conversion and selectivity observed from reaction temperature variation could be duly attributed. XPS data of the pre-reduced catalyst ReOx/TiO2 are found on Fig. 1d, and show mainly Re7+ (74.3 at%), alongside with Re6+ (18.8 at%) and Re4+ (6.9 at%). On the catalyst surface, a percentage of 3 at% of rhenium was detected. Metallic Re° was not detected, suggesting that it was either not formed (at the reduction temperature used) or it oxidized during sample handling (the reduction step for XPS analysis was performed ex situ). Further XPS data can be found on Supplementary Information Figure SI 3 and Figure SI 4. It should be noted that the catalyst, although pre-reduced, was not handled in inert atmosphere and was exposed to air previously to the acquirement of XPS, meaning that in situ amounts of Re4+ could in fact be higher than measured, since even a brief exposure of Re4+ to air will affect the species identified in XPS, as demonstrated by Rozmysłowicz [57]. Okal et al. have also studied how particle size affects oxidation of metallic Re° nanoparticles, using XPS and TEM measurements. These authors have found that small nanoparticles oxidize much easier than large ones - even at room temperature, Re° nanoparticles of 2 nm briefly exposed to oxygen were oxidized to Re4+, Re6+ and Re7+, demonstrating that O2 produces a dramatic effect on the oxidation of small clusters of metallic rhenium, even at 20 °C. An increase in temperature up to 150 °C leads to a higher extension of oxidized species, especially of Re7+. Therefore, the presence of a small amount of oxygen might affect the rhenium species present during the reaction [58]. Regarding binding energies of Re species from XPS, the values encountered for Re7+ 4f7/2 was 45.88 eV, which is 1 eV lower than the value reported in literature, of 46.9 eV for Re/γ-Al2O3 catalyst [58] and closer to the one found for similar Re/TiO2 catalysts, of 46.1 eV [40]; binding energy detected for Re6+ was 44.15 eV, slightly lower than the value reported for Re/γ-Al2O3, of 44.5 eV [58]; finally, for Re4+ binding energy of 42.51 eV was detected, which is similar to values reported in literature for Re/γ-Al2O3 [58]. The values encountered here can indicate a charge transfer from TiO2 to ReOx, in a way that increases the Re electron density. Also, Re is reported to be highly dispersed on TiO2 when compared to other supports like Al2O3 and SiO2 [42], implying that TiO2 surface can stabilize the Re clusters by means of strong interaction between the oxides, in a possible surface Re-O-Ti bond."
10,Supercritical flow reactions,"3.3 Supercritical flow reactions In order to evaluate the impact of temperature, pressure and space velocity on CO2 conversion rate and product selectivity, the flow reaction was performed at a fixed CO2/H2 molar ratio of 1/4 and a flow rate of 0.5–2 mL min−1. This flow rate was measured at the syringe pump, which was at the same pressure as the reactor, but at a temperature of 0 °C. Weight hourly space velocities (WHSV) calculated at each reaction condition can be found in Table 3 , along with values for methanol space-time yield (STY), CO2 conversion rate and product selectivity for each reaction condition tested. The main obtained results are summarized on Fig. 2 . These values are superior to those usually reported for the production of CH3OH from CO2 [59]. It is noted that blank reactions were performed both with an empty reactor and with the reactor filled with pure TiO2 - no CO2 conversion was observed at either blank reaction. Flow reactions at ambient pressure were also studied at several temperatures, yet those yielded no methanol. At ambient pressure and a temperature range of 100–350 °C, the main product is CO. These results can be found in Supplementary Information section A2. The results show that an increase in temperature leads to a significant increase in conversion rates, likely due to a kinetic effect. At 250 °C, a conversion rate of 41% was achieved. Nevertheless, at 250 °C, methane selectivity increased to 35% at the expense of methanol selectivity, which fell from 98 to 65%. The reaction of CO2 methanation is exothermic (ΔH298 K = −165 kJ mol−1), meaning its thermodynamic equilibrium is shifted away from CH4 at higher temperatures. Yet, the hydrogenation of CO2 into CH4 is kinetically limited, explaining why increasing temperature leads to the formation of more CH4 [60]. Thus, 200 °C can be considered an optimal temperature for this process, since methanol selectivity was 98% and CO2 conversion was 18%. At 150 °C, selectivity was the same as at 200 °C, although the CO2 conversion rate fell to merely 4%. To evaluate the impact of pressure on the reaction rates and product selectivity, the hydrogenation of CO2, was performed in a set of three different pressures: 40, 80 and 100 bar, at a fixed temperature of 250 °C. As expected, the CO2 conversion rate grows slightly with an increase in pressure, which could be explained not only by the higher density of the substrate mixture, but also by the improvement in diffusion rates of the gaseous reactants and products within the solid catalyst. Moreover, an interesting effect on selectivity is observed as well – higher pressures yield methanol more selectively, while lower pressures give more methane. It was considered that this result could reflect a phase behaviour effect – if methanol condensation could happen inside the reactor at lower pressures, that would be the reason why less methanol is observed at lower pressures, as opposed to an actual impact of pressure on selectivity. This hypothesis was discarded, as it is supposed that at T =250 °C, there is a single phase at the whole range of pressures studied. This assumption is based on the fact that the operating temperature of 250 °C is higher than the critical temperature of all mixture components but water [61]. Water as a single component would have a saturation pressure of P = 40 bar according to REFPROP software [62]. This saturation pressure is far larger than the partial pressure of water at the most unfavourable reaction conditions, which is approximately Pwater =11 bar. Because of this large difference, it is assumed that all components, including water and methanol, are in the gas phase at any pressure at the reaction temperature of 250 °C. A more comprehensive analysis of phase behaviour at all conditions tested can be found on Supplementary Information section A4. The mechanism of the CO2 hydrogenation into methanol can either follow the formate route or the reverse water-gas-shift (RWGS) route, as illustrated on Scheme 2 . The analysis of reaction intermediates and side products can lead to a better understanding of which mechanistic path the catalyst leads to [63–66]. Sahki et al. have evaluated the impact of pressure on CO2 hydrogenation mechanisms catalysed by CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 [67]. These authors have verified that when the pressure increases from 1 to 75 bar, the selectivity towards methanol increases significatively from 5.3% to 47.1%. According to Sahki et al., higher pressures favour the formate route, since the increase in pressure is accompanied not only by an increase in methanol but also by a decrease in CO amount [67]. Gaikwad et al. also confirmed the same effect of pressure on the CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 selectivity towards methanol [68]. However, there is not much information about the impact of pressure on other types of catalysts. In fact, this information could give important insights about the mechanism by which CO2 is converted. The study of Hartardi et al. is one of the few examples that approaches this subject [69]. These authors have evaluated the impact of pressure on the conversion and selectivity of several gold-based catalysts (e.g. Au/ZnO). Their results show that increasing pressure improved selectivity towards methanol, but contrary to what was reported by Sahki et al., the amount of CO did not decrease upon an increase in pressure [69]. These differences suggest that the conversion of CO2 might follow different mechanisms. Our results show that when the pressure increases from 40 to 100 bar, methanol selectivity improves significatively from 40% to 65%, and CH4 falls from 60% to 35%, whereas CO selectivity maintains a marginal value. The fact that CO selectivity does not follow the same tendency as CH3OH selectivity suggests that ReOx/TiO2 catalyst does not follow the RWGS route for methanol formation, and that the small amount of CO observed could result from the decomposition of methanol, which is an endothermic process (ΔH298 K = 90.6 kJ mol−1) [45]. To better understand the selectivity of this reaction, an infrared spectroscopic study of the substances adsorbed on the catalytic surface was performed under a flow of CO2 and H2. The spectra obtained can be seen on Fig. 3 . The spectra became visibly more intense as the temperature increased from R.T. up to 250 °C. Bands at ca. 1423 and 1687 cm−1 can be attributed to surface bicarbonates on TiO2 [70]. These could be observed on the spectra in all the tested temperatures, although in low intensity. High intensity bands were detected at 1539 cm−1 and 1342 cm−1, and were attributed to vibrational modes of adsorbed formate species on ReOx/TiO2 surface, based on their frequencies [70,71]. These formate species appeared at 150 °C, and their intensities increase at higher temperatures, which is the same tendency observed in the methanol production. These results indicate that methanol is produced through the formate (HCOO*) intermediate route, instead of following the RWGS route, as noted on Scheme 2. Interestingly, although no gaseous CO is observed neither in the infrared spectra nor in GC-TCD analysis of reaction products collect during this experiment, adsorbed CO species were detected on the sample by the in-situ FTIR data. At 200 °C and 250 °C, a CO stretching mode can be attributed to the band at 2021 cm−1, corresponding to linearly adsorbed CO [72]. Chemisorbed CO in bidentate configuration can also be observed, especially at 250 °C, at 1923 cm−1 and at 1872 cm−1 [73]. Nonetheless, no gaseous CO is observed, which would reveal a band at 2170 cm−1. The comparison between linear CO and polydentate modes shows that the sample is more populate by the latter. This may be due to a stronger chemisorption of bridged CO, whereas linearly adsorbed CO can be more easily desorbed [72,74]. The adsorbed CO species observed could contribute to the formation of methane. Selectivity towards CH4 increased to 35% at 250 °C, which is also the temperature where chemisorbed CO can be more clearly observed at 2021 cm−1, at 1923 cm−1 and at 1872 cm−1. Therefore, it is possible that the adsorbed CO acts as an intermediate species to the formation of CH4, rather than being desorbed as gaseous CO. The reaction pathway leading to CH4 can be found on Scheme 2. The increase in intensity in general as temperature increases, and the appearance of chemisorbed CO at ca. 2023 cm−1, which is a typical frequency of metal carbonyls, might suggest that Re is being reduced as the reaction occurs, by chemisorbed H* on catalyst surface. [72] Over the ReOx/TiO2 catalyst, an increase on pressure favours selectivity towards methanol against methane. This could be explained by the thermodynamic equilibrium of the CO2 hydrogenation reactions. Both the hydrogenation of CO2 into CH3OH (Eq. (1)) and into CH4 (Eq. (2)) lead to a volume contraction, due to the stoichiometry of said reactions. Yet, this effect is larger on (Eq. 1). Hence, according to Le Chatelier’s principle, an increase in pressure should favour CH3OH more than CH4. (1) CO2 + 3 H2→ CH3OH + H2O (2) CO2 + 4 H2→ CH4 + 2 H2O It is worth mentioning that our results in flow supercritical conditions are distinct from the previously published by Ting el al. [44]. They have used a similar catalyst produced by wet impregnation of ammonium perrhenate (NH4ReO4) in TiO2 ST-01 to perform CO2 reduction at 150 °C, yielding methanol at 82% selectivity at a turn over number of 44 [44]. Although both catalysts use rhenium over TiO2, they exhibit important differences regarding the synthesis (e.g. rhenium precursor, titanium oxide variety and reduction temperature), which might explain the differences obtained, especially for both conversion rate and selectivity. However, the main difference is the CO2 hydrogenation process itself. They have used a batch system containing 1 mL of 1,4-dioxane, H2/CO2 ratio of 1/5, and a reaction time of 24 h, which makes this system substantially different from the continuous supercritical flow process described here. Therefore, no direct and fair comparison can be done between both works. In order to evaluate the performance of the ReOx/TiO2 catalyst in comparison to the thermodynamic equilibrium of the CO2 hydrogenation reaction, a thermodynamic assessment was performed. The main results of the thermodynamic equilibrium simulation are summarized on Fig. 4 , and further data can be found on Supplementary Information. The simulation showed that CO2 conversion is favourable at high pressures and at low temperatures. Although these conditions enhance CO2 conversion, they also seem to favour methane formation. High pressure and low temperature hinder carbon deposition and favour methanation reaction [75]. It is relevant to mention that not many studies were performed in the literature considering both CH3OH and CH4 at equilibrium. In one hand, methanation reactions from CO and CO2 both present a low ΔG value, leading to high CH4 selectivity and yield at the expense of CH3OH and CO at a wide range of temperature and pressure [60,76,77]. On the other hand, CH4 is not considered as a favourable product over traditional Cu-based catalysts often used for methanol synthesis from CO2 [29], which justifies its removal from the thermodynamic analysis in those cases. With ReOx/TiO2 as catalyst, CH4 is present at considerable selectivity, meaning it must be included. The performed analysis (Fig. 4) shows that methanol and carbon monoxide selectivity at the thermodynamic equilibrium are nearly zero as CO2 is almost fully converted to CH4, although trends can be investigated. Results suggest that methanol selectivity is thermodynamically favoured at high pressures and high temperatures. A similar trend is observed for CO selectivity, although decreasing pressure affects it positively. The assessment of thermodynamic equilibrium shows that the production of methanol and carbon monoxide are concurrent, with the latter being more prominent than the former in almost every case, especially at higher temperatures. Experimental results depicted on Figure SI 5 and Fig. 2 show that methanation is favoured at higher temperatures for the ReOx/TiO2, while thermodynamics suggest that CH4 selectivity should be close to 100% throughout the 150−250 °C temperature range. This large difference between the composition of the thermodynamic equilibrium and the one observed over ReOx/TiO2 is probably due to kinetic effects, both related to the CO2 methanation reaction itself, which has been previously reported to be kinetically limited [77,78], and also to the introduction of ReOx/TiO2 as catalyst, which has significantly influenced the selectivity of the CO2 hydrogenation reaction towards the desired methanol production, in spite of the thermodynamics of this reaction predicting that it would be the least favoured product. Continuous reaction processes, like this one, are highly influenced by the residence time inside the reactor. Higher space velocities have been shown to decrease CO2 conversion, since they lead to shorter residence times [45,46,68,79,80], which is confirmed by experimental results in this work (Fig. 5 and Table 3). Interestingly, at higher space velocities, selectivity to methanol is increased, since less methane is being produced, which is in agreement with the work presented by other authors [78,80]. This may happen because CO2 can only be completely reduced to methane at longer contact times with the catalyst, which is expected since the hydrogenation of CO2 into CH4 is kinetically limited, in spite of being thermodynamically favoured [60]. Space velocity also directly affects the methanol space-time yield (STY), as the WHSV relates the hourly mass flow of the reagents to the mass of catalyst present in the reactor, and STY is a parameter of methanol hourly production per mass of catalyst. A reduction in the conversion rate from 41% to 22% is noticed when WHSV increases from 4 h−1 to 19 h−1. Even so, the increase on WHSV still led to an increment in the STY from 407 mmol g−1 h−1 to 1248 mmol g−1 h−1. Thus, at higher WHSV, STY increases despite the lower conversion rates, since the loss of conversion is not as pronounced as the increase on reactant flow. In the case of the process described here, the increase on selectivity at higher space velocities also contributes positively to methanol STY. The literature suggests that reactions conducted with separation of reaction products through condensation of methanol and water would lead to high methanol yield due to the effect of product removal on the equilibrium [45]. Thus, phase equilibria can have a high relevance in pressurized CO2 hydrogenation processes [51]. The evaluation of the phase behaviour in the process described herein using each experimental outlet composition (Table SI 3) shows that, even at extreme conditions (low temperature and high pressure), there is no water nor methanol condensation, since either considering pure components or the CH3OH-H2O binary mixture (Figure SI 12), the partial pressure still remains lower than that of dew point. Therefore, results from this study show that high methanol yields are also possible at gas phase when operating at supercritical conditions, given the right catalyst."
11,Conclusion,"A highly selective process for the conversion of CO2 into methanol using a supercritical flow process is reported, without solvents and additives, catalysed by ReOx/TiO2. An unprecedented high selectivity to methanol (98%) at ∼20% conversion rate was achieved at a relatively mild temperature of 200 °C when using 100 bar of pressure (CO2/H2 molar ratio of 1/4). On the other hand, an increase in temperature to 250 °C led to a higher conversion rate, though partly due to an increase in methane production. The methanol selectivity at 250 °C could be increased with a higher space velocity, at the cost of decreasing CO2 conversion rate. The high pressure used in the flow process was shown to be an important variable not only in conversion rate but also in selectivity. These results open an interesting doorway to develop continuous supercritical processes at mild temperatures."
