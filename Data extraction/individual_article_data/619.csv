0,Introduction,"Transforming the fossil resource based economy into a sustainable one, as currently planned by many industrial countries, will come along with massive changes in the way energy and chemicals are produced and used. This holds great potential for biotechnological processes since nature supplies us with an easy and readily available renewable resource in form of crop plants. Although these plants provide sugars and fats that can be directly fed to biotechnological processes, they also have downsides, mainly stemming from their large areal demand: i) the amount of light that is fixed into chemical energy of the desired substrate is rather low (2.4–3.7% (Zhu et al., 2008) compared to >14% with photovoltaics coupled with electrolysis (Rothschild and Dotan, 2017)), ii) there is a conflict of the production of food with substrates for biotechnology because both use the same agricultural area, iii) industrial cultivation of crops poses threats to our ecosystems in form of water consumption, erosion, pesticides (Woodhouse, 2010) and many more. One strategy to mitigate these problems is to use alternative renewable resources: surplus glycerol has been widely used as a substrate for biotechnological processes and residual biomass can be hydrolyzed into its sugar monomers or directly gasified to produce energy-rich synthesis gas. This energy-rich gas can then in turn be converted to methanol, which is the feed-stock for the so-called “methanol-economy”, or directly fed to microbes for synthesis gas fermentation. These concepts are under research by a great number of research groups and have also partially been commercialized (Takors et al., 2018). Energy rich gas in form of hydrogen can also be produced in a sustainable way by coupling photovoltaics to electrolysis that have a substantially higher areal efficiency than crops. Hydrogen gas can be mixed with CO2 and used as synthesis gas. CO2 can also be hydrogenated to formic acid that is the substrate for the “formate based bio-economy” (Yishai et al., 2016). Alternatively, the direct electro-catalytic production of formic acid is investigated by some research groups (Lee et al., 2015). Synthesis gas, formate and methanol can be used by acetogens or methanogens in anaerobic processes to produce highly reduced organic compounds like short-chained fatty acids and alcohols or methane with high yield and energy efficiency (Claassens et al., 2019). Other biomolecules, like sugar, that have a high demand of ATP for their synthesis are, however, not suitable as products for these organisms because of thermodynamical reasons: In acetogens, biosynthesis of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, the first sugar-phosphate in gluconeogenesis, from acetyl-CoA requires 3 mol ATP and one reduced ferredoxin per mol acetyl-CoA. Yet acetyl-CoA synthesis yields only 0.5 ATP/mol even in the most optimistic case (Bertsch and Müller, 2015). Sugars synthesis therefore needs additional ATP. For this purpose, hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria are well suited as they can use synthesis gas and at the same time are able to breath oxygen to generate ATP that is necessary to produce these energy rich compounds (Takors et al., 2018). These concepts for a future bioeconomcy and the corresponding products are illustrated in Fig. 1 . In this study, this approach is showcased by the production of trehalose, an industrially relevant sugar (Ohtake and Wang, 2011), from synthesis gas. As a host Cupriavidus necator H16, formerly known as Ralstonia eutropha H16, was chosen as it is well understood and genetic tools are available (Unrean et al., 2019). First, the natural occurring trehalose metabolism in this bacterium was elucidated by bioinformatic methods and the accumulation of said sugar was shown experimentally. Next, the organism was engineered for the secretion of trehalose, resembling the approach applied previously (Ducat et al., 2012) for secretion of sucrose from cyanobacteria. And finally, production of trehalose from a hydrogen-gas enriched gas mixture and other, non-carbohydrate substrates with the engineered C. necator strain was shown."
1,Material and methods,
2,Bioinformatic analysis,"2.1 Bioinformatic analysis In order to identify genes responsible for glycogen or sugar synthesis, a homology search was performed using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (Altschul et al., 1990). Additionally, the STRING database (Szklarczyk et al., 2019) was used to identify possible gene interactions and annotations. Enzyme functionalities and reaction maps were collected from the KEGG database (Yi et al., 2020). For each protein, a template was chosen from an organism in which the function of the respective protein was characterized in former studies: Since in C. glutamicum ATCC 13032, homologs to most genes could be found, the protein sequences of this organism were used as a reference except for the sequences GlgA and TreF that were not present in its genome, and for the GH15-family hydrolase that was not characterized. For these proteins, sequences from E. coli K-12 MG1655 (GlgA and TreF) or C.necator H16 (GH15-family hydrolase) were used as a template. Homology was evaluated based on the score that was normalized to the score of the template itself."
3,Construction of expression plasmids,"2.2 Construction of expression plasmids All expression plasmids used in this study derive from the XylS/Pm-based expression plasmid pSEVA228 of the Standard European Vector Architecture (SEVA) library (Martínez-García et al., 2015). In general, restriction/ligation cloning was used for the construction of plasmids. In brief: Genes of interest were amplified with PCR from genomic DNA (gDNA) templates. gDNA was extracted from E. coli DH5α, E. coli BL21(DE3), P. putida KT2440 or N. lactamica DSM 4691 using the “Genomic DNA from tissue” kit by MACHEREY-NAGEL GmbH & Co. KG (Germany) or was directly ordered from the DSMZ GmbH (Germany). Forward primers included a restriction enzyme recognition site, followed by the Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) AGGAGGCTTCAT, directly followed by the start codon. PCR products and pSEVA228 plasmids were purified, digested with suitable restriction enzymes and ligated with T4 ligase. For the site-specific mutations in the treB gene, overlap extension PCR (OE-PCR) was used in three rounds of PCR (Higuchi et al., 1988): In a first round, up- and downstream fragments (1.2 kB upstream, 0.3 kB downstream) were PCR-amplified using specific primers carrying the site-specific base changes. After gel purification, equal molarities of both fragments were mixed in a new Q5 PCR reaction without primers, using an annealing temperature of 60 °C and an elongation time corresponding to the full length constructs for 15 cycles. 8 µL of this reaction was directly used without purification in the third and final round of PCR in a 50 µL reaction including the flanking primers treB_E385A_fw2 and treB_V383N_fw2 with restriction enzyme recognition sites. This was restriction digested, purified and ligated as described above. All purification and extraction steps were performed using kits by MACHEREY-NAGEL or NIPPON Genetics EUROPE GmbH (Germany). All enzymes were ordered from New England Biolabs GmbH (Germany). A complete list of plasmids used in this study can be found in Table 1 ."
4,Transformation & conjugation,"2.3 Transformation & conjugation Ligated DNA was transformed into competent E. coli DH5α λ-pir following the method of Chung et al. (Chung et al., 1989). Resulting colonies were checked with colony-PCR, followed by sequencing using suitable primers. For expression in C. necator H16, the plasmids were then transferred via conjugation with the sitting drop method using the helper strain E. coli HB101 (pRK600) as described by others (de Lorenzo and Timmis, 1994) into C. necator H16. C.necator H16 strains with the desired plasmids were then selected by streaking the conjugation mixture on either minimal medium with 300 mg L−1 kanamycin using citrate as a carbon source or in Lysogeny-Broth (LB) medium with 300 mg L−1 kanamycin and 100 mg L−1 streptomycin."
5,Cultivation media and heterotrophic cultivation procedures,"2.4 Cultivation media and heterotrophic cultivation procedures E. coli DH5α and BL21(DE3) and C. necator H16 cultures for plasmid and genomic DNA extraction, as well as for transformation, were grown in LB medium. C. necator was additionally cultured in minimal medium: For the initial screenings of the different transport proteins, a modified low-phosphate minimal medium was used (de Aragão et al., 1996) as trehalose and phosphate share a similar retention time in our HPLC method and peaks are thus likely to overlap making quantification difficult at high phosphate concentrations. The medium consisted of (per liter): 0.19 g EDTA, 0.06 g ferrous ammonium citrate, 0.5 g MgSO4, 0.01 g of CaCI2·2H2O and 5.0 g of (NH4)2SO4. Additionally, 1 mL L−1 of a trace element solution was added, consisting of (per liter): 0.3 g of H3BO3, 0.2 g of CoCl2·6H2O, 0.1 g of ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.03 g of MnCI2∙4H2O, 0.03 g of Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.02 g of NiCI2·6H2O and 0.01 g of CuSO4·5H2O. For the heterotrophic and autotrophic cultivations of C. necator H16 (pSEVA228-setA), a phosphate-rich, modified MR medium (Lee and Lee, 1996) was used to buffer the acidic carbon source and the carbonate in autotrophic cultivations. Modified MR medium consisted of (per liter): 6.67 g KH2PO4, 4.0 g (NH4)2HPO4, 1.4 g MgSO4·7H2O. Citric acid was replaced with the carbon source of interest, e.g. sodium acetate, fructose etc. For the sake of simplification, the same trace element solution was used as in the low-phosphate medium. The missing iron solution was supplied as a 100x stock solution of (per liter) 19 g EDTA, 6 g ferrous ammonium citrate. Cultures in shake flasks were incubated at 37 °C for E. coli and 30 °C for C. necator and P. putida in a rotary shaker (ThermoFisher, USA) at a rotation frequency of 220 rpm. Antibiotics were used when necessary in solid or liquid media: 300 mg L−1 kanamycin for C.necator (50 mg L−1 for E. coli), 34 mg L−1 chloramphenicol (E. coli), 100 mg L−1 streptomycin (E.coli). The inducer 3-methylbenzoic acid was in general used at a concentration of 0.1 mM."
6,Autotrophic cultivation of C. necator H16 (pSEVA228-setA),"2.5 Autotrophic cultivation of C. necator H16 (pSEVA228-setA) Autotrophic cultivation of C. necator H16 (pSEVA228-setA) was carried out in air-tight butyl-rubber sealed 500 mL security-coated glass bottles with a working volume of 25 mL. Bottles and sealings were autoclaved separately. After sterilely filling medium into the bottles, they were tightly sealed and gassed with a mixture of 6:1 of H2:CO2 for 5 min through a syringe needle. A second syringe needle was stung through the rubber to release the pressure. After that, 71 mL of pure oxygen were added with a sterile syringe. Inoculation and sampling were also achieved through the rubber sealing with sterile syringes. Each bottle was inoculated with 0.4 mL of LB-grown C. necator pre-cultures. Bottles were shaken at a temperature of 30 °C and a frequency of 100 rpm in a shaking incubator. All critical operations were done in an explosion protected fume hood."
7,Optical density and sugar analytics,"2.6 Optical density and sugar analytics Optical densities (OD) were measured at 600 nm in a microplate reader (TECAN, Switzerland) using a volume of 200 µL in transparent microplates. ODs were correlated to optical densities measured in a photometer with a light path of 1 cm and then to CDW using a correlation described by others (Grunwald et al., 2015). Sugar concentrations were measured following a previously published protocol (Löwe et al., 2017) with a Shodex SH1011 column. In brief, an Agilent 1100 series (Waldbronn, Germany) system was used with filtered 0.5 mM H2SO4 as mobile phase, a flow rate of 0.45 mL min−1 and a column temperature of 30 °C. 20 µL of filtered and diluted sample were injected and analyzed by their refractive index (RI) signal. In order to quantify intracellular sugars in the experiments with the low-phosphate medium, cells were centrifuged and the pellets were lysed with 0.1 M NaOH at 80 °C for 1 h. In cultivation experiments with high-phosphate medium, trehalose was hydrolyzed prior to analysis with the cell-lysates containing the trehalase TreF from E. coli. The cell lysate was produced as follows: E. coli (pSEVA228-galP-TreF) was grown in 25 mL of LB with 50 mg L−1 kanamycin and 0.1 mM of the inducer 3-MB. When cultures entered stationary phase, the fermentation broths were centrifuged and concentrated by a factor of 50 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Cells were then mixed with glass beads and lysed in a ball mill (RETSCH GmbH, Germany) for 15 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged and the supernatant was stored at 8 °C. For the hydrolysis of trehalose, mixtures with 10% lysate and 90% sample were incubated for 2 h, filtered and analyzed by HPLC."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Bioinformatic identification of trehalose and glycogen synthesis genes,"3.1 Bioinformatic identification of trehalose and glycogen synthesis genes Recently, autotrophic sugar production and secretion have been engineered and demonstrated in cyanobacteria by various studies (Ducat et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2020; Thiel et al., 2019). An impressive proportion of the fixed carbon can be directed to sugar synthesis and exported from the cell. As both cyanobacteria and C.necator are using the Calvin Cycle under autotrophic conditions for carbon fixation, it was assumed that a similar concept might be applied to C. necator. Homologs of genes for the synthesis of the cyanobacterial osmolytes sucrose or glycosylglycerol are missing in C. necator, however. Instead, gene clusters for the synthesis of trehalose are present. Trehalose is a disaccharide accumulated by some bacteria under conditions of stress like elevated salt concentrations (Giaever et al., 1988). There are three pathways for the synthesis of trehalose which all seem to be present in C.necator (compare Fig. 2 ): 1. 1 The otsAB pathway that is well described in Escherichia coli (Giaever et al., 1988), is responsible for the production of trehalose from glucose-6-phosphate and UDP-glucose. 2. The treYZ pathway connects glycogen and trehalose metabolism. It uses glycogen as a substrate for trehalose synthesis and was extensively studied in Corynebacterium glutamicum (Carpinelli et al., 2006). 3. The trehalose synthases TreS and TreSB catalyze the reversible conversion of maltose to trehalose, but is not suitable for trehalose accumulation since almost equal amounts of maltose would be co-accumulated. As maltose has a reactive aldehyde group in contrast to all known osmolytes, this is a rather unlikely way to produce trehalose. TreS/TreSB instead seem to be involved in trehalose degradation/cycling (Ruhal et al., 2013). All genes involved in trehalose synthesis are organized in two gene clusters in C. necator. The otsAB cluster is located on chromosome 1 and treYZ, treSB and the genes involved in glycogen synthesis are located in a gene cluster on chromosome 2. When comparing the genes for glycogen production in various organisms, it is interesting to note that C. necator does not contain any homolog of the glgA or glgM genes which are responsible for glycogen synthesis in all known organisms that form glycogen. The only way to produce glycogen would be through the synthesis of trehalose by OtsAB, conversion to maltose-phosphate by TreSB and elongation of glycogen by GlgE (illustrated in Fig. 2). This pathway of glycogen synthesis has not been described in other organisms, but as trehalose and glycogen metabolism seem to be closely intertwined (Ruhal et al., 2013), it seems likely that the trehalose based synthesis of glycogen could be more wide-spread in bacteria. Since glycogen metabolism has never been experimentally addressed in C. necator, this needs further investigation."
10,C. necator H16 accumulates trehalose under conditions of salt stress,"3.2 C. necator H16 accumulates trehalose under conditions of salt stress Next, it was tested whether or not C. necator H16 is actually accumulating trehalose under laboratory growth conditions. In former publications, it was found that E. coli produces trehalose when cells are stressed by increased osmotic pressure (Giaever et al., 1988) which was attributed to the protective nature of trehalose (Ohtake and Wang, 2011). As C. necator H16 possesses two pathways for trehalose synthesis, it might also serve as a protective molecule in conditions of salt stress like in E. coli. To test whether this is true, C. necator H16 was cultivated in shake flasks with 150 mM NaCl or without salt. As a control, the influence of 3-methylbenzoate (3-MB) on trehalose synthesis was checked since it is one of the preferred inducers for the XylS/Pm expression system that was used later on in this study for gene expression in C.necator for further genetic engineering. In fact, cell lysates of cultures that were grown over-night and analyzed by HPLC with a sugars and organic acids column, showed a peak in response to salt addition with a retention time equal to a trehalose standard. To confirm that the peak corresponded to trehalose, the samples were treated with cell lysate of cells expressing the cytoplasmic trehalase TreF from E. coli. Cleavage with TreF resulted in the formation of glucose as the sole product while at the same time the peak corresponding to trehalose disappeared from the chromatogram, validating that the accumulated compound was indeed trehalose. It can be excluded that the glucose originated from other cell storage compounds like maltose or glycogen as the TreF containing cell lysate did not show any detectable maltose or glycogen hydrolyzing activity and did not contain any sugars by itself, which was tested in a control experiment. Table 2 summarizes the optical densities, the trehalose concentrations and estimated trehalose mass fraction of the cells at the time of sampling one day after inoculation."
11,Engineering C. necator H16 for trehalose secretion,"3.3 Engineering C. necator H16 for trehalose secretion Having shown that C. necator is able to accumulate trehalose intracellularly, the next step was to genetically modify the strain to secrete the disaccharide into the medium, following the approach that has been demonstrated in cyanobacteria in previous works (Ducat et al., 2012): There, the osmolyte sucrose that is naturally produced by some bacteria in response to salt stress was secreted by means of the sucrose permease CscB from E. coli. Originally, CscB has been characterized as a sucrose/H+-symporter (Peng et al., 2009; Sahintoth et al., 1995) that transports sucrose into the cell driven by the force of the membrane potential. A trehalose/H+-symporter has unfortunately never been described in the literature, neither has an antiporter or channel protein for trehalose been found in bacteria. In Drosophila melanogaster, the trehalose facilitator Tret1-1 has been characterized (Kanamori et al., 2010). Yet functional expression of eukaryotic membrane proteins has been proven difficult in bacteria in many cases (Schlegel et al., 2010). Therefore, this was not the ideal protein candidate for trehalose secretion. In order to find a way to secrete sugars in C. necator, three different transport proteins were tested (illustrated in Fig. 3 ): 1. Converting trehalose to maltose by trehalose synthase A (TreS) from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 and secretion by the maltose/H+-symporter MalY that is found in Neisseria meningitidis (Derkaoui et al., 2016) (strategy (I) in Fig. 3). For this purpose, the malY gene from Neisseria lactamica, a close relative of N. meningitidis with safety class I, was used. The two genes were combined in the bicistronic expression plasmid pSEVA228-malY-treS. 2. Engineering the trehalose PTS IIC subunit of E. coli DH5α (treB gene) for facilitated transport of trehalose (strategy (II) in Fig. 3). Other PTS transport subunits II have been shown to switch from phosphorylation to facilitated transport when amino acids in the highly conserved GITE-motif are mutated (Otte et al., 2003; Ruijter et al., 1992). In the TreB protein, the homologous sequence equaling to “GVTE” is spanning from amino acid position 382 to 385. The two mutations E385A and V383N were chosen as they were successful for the mannitol PTS IIC transport subunit (Otte et al., 2003) and the glucose PTS subunit II ptsG in E. coli (Ruijter et al., 1992), respectively. The mutated versions of treB were constructed and ligated into the multiple cloning site of pSEVA228. As a control the wild type treB gene was also tested. On top of trehalose secretion, facilitated transport of maltose through TreB as reported by Decker et al. (Decker et al., 1999) (strategy (III) in Fig. 3) was also evaluated. For this purpose, a bicistronic gene expression cassette with treB with treS was constructed. 3. Expression of the sugar efflux transporter gene setA from E. coli. The protein product has been shown to transport glucose and lactose (Liu et al., 1999b). In addition, several saccharides, among them maltose, were able to inhibit transport of lactose. It was speculated that these saccharides might also be substrates for SetA (Liu et al., 1999b) (strategy (IV) and (V) in Fig. 3). The setA gene from E. coli BL21 was cloned into pSEVA228 yielding pSEVA228-setA. Additionally, setA and treS were combined in the plasmid pSEVA228-setA-treS to additionally check for a possible secretion of maltose alone. A complete list of the tested expression plasmids can be found in Table 1. All plasmids were evaluated for their ability to confer sugar secretion to C. necator with 150 mM NaCl and expression of the respective genes were induced with 3–MB using fructose as a carbon source. Trehalose secretion was evaluated after one day of cultivation. The expression plasmids pSEVA228-setA and pSEVA228-setA-treS showed an increased secretion of sugars, reaching titers of 128 and 120 mg L−1 after one day, respectively, indicating that SetA can in fact additionally transport trehalose. Low sugar concentrations, between 6 and 26 mg L−1, were found for all other transport systems in the culture medium, even for the negative control (wild-type TreB alone). This residual maltose/trehalose peak is probably a result of unspecific secretion, cell lysis or due to centrifugation of the cells. It is very likely that in the experiment with plasmid pSEVA228-setA-treS, maltose and trehalose were both secreted, but as maltose and trehalose show a similar retention time in the HPLC method used, the disaccharides could not be separated in this experiment. TreB in combination with TreS also led to a secretion that was slightly higher than the negative control with the TreB wildtype enzyme. Facilitated transport of maltose through TreB has been described as a side reaction (Decker et al., 1999) and additionally, facilitated transport is not pushed by the proton motive force. This might explain the minor capability of TreB to transport maltose compared to SetA. Since trehalose is a more interesting and valuable sugar than maltose, the following cultivation studies were performed with the strain C. necator H16 (pSEVA228-setA). The finding that SetA can secrete trehalose also raised the question whether or not this protein is responsible for the secretion of trehalose in other bacteria that are naturally accumulating trehalose in the culture medium like Corynebacterium glutamicium (Wittmann et al., 2004) or various Micrococcus strains (Kizawa et al., 1995). In the two strains C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 and Micrococcus luteus NCTC 2665, no significant homolog of SetA could be found. Therefore, the proteins involved in trehalose export remains elusive in these strains, but might have the potential to be a further source of a trehalose transport protein."
12,Engineering of the GITE-motif of the PTS transport subunit for decoupling was not predictable,"3.4 Engineering of the GITE-motif of the PTS transport subunit for decoupling was not predictable The lack of trehalose secretion by TreB variants shows that the effect of mutations is not predictable enough for rational engineering of the PTS transport subunits for facilitated transport. Interestingly, although the TreB(E385A) protein did not show any facilitated transport, the strain overexpressing this protein grew considerably slower (data not shown). If this approach is to be followed in the future, it would be interesting to perform semi-rational protein engineering of residues in and near the GITE-motif with saturation mutagenesis. Alternatively, a selection scheme for facilitated transport of TreB could be developed, for example by coupling the TreB gene with the reversible trehalose synthase TreS and a maltose phosphorylase and thereby allowing growth only with a facilitated transport of trehalose by TreB without phosphorylation. Such selection schemes have been successful in E. coli in other studies (Otte et al., 2003; Ruijter et al., 1992)."
13,Sugar/H+-symporters are not suitable for sugar secretion with a normal PMF,"3.5 Sugar/H+-symporters are not suitable for sugar secretion with a normal PMF In the experiments with constructs using MalY as the secretion protein, no significant amount of sugar was detected either. The activity of TreS was tested by enzyme assays with the lysate of these cells to exclude a problem with the conversion of trehalose to maltose. In C. necator, it is expected that the proton motive force (PMF) at pH 7 in the cultivation medium promotes higher proton concentrations on the periplasmic site of the membrane. In fact, a conventional PMF (i.e. higher intracellular pH) and ATP synthase activity in the plasma membrane was recently shown for C. necator (Poladyan et al., 2019). Therefore, maltose secretion with a symporter does not seem very likely. This leaves the question: Why did sugar transport work with the sucrose/H+-symporter CscB in S. elongatus in the first place? As Ducat et al. noted (Ducat et al., 2012), the membrane potential is reversed in S. elongatus because of the high pH outside of the cell. However, this does also mean that ATP cannot be generated at the inner membrane by canonical proton-translocating ATP synthases. It is likely that ATP is rather produced at the thylakoid membrane of these organisms and that the plasma membrane does not have an active transmembrane gradient. This might also contribute to the high pH tolerance of this organism that can thrive at pH > 9 (Mortezaeikia et al., 2016) and is in line with the transport of carbonate via a Na+-gradient or in an ATP dependent manner (Schwarz et al., 2011). In any case, for a bacterium with a text-book proton motive force (PMF) like C.necator H16, an H+/symporter is not supposed to function as a secretion protein. SetA, in contrast, was found to act as an antiporter (Liu et al., 1999a), and thus uses the PMF in the other direction, i.e. for the export of sugar."
14,Production of trehalose from organic substrates by engineered strains,"3.6 Production of trehalose from organic substrates by engineered strains After the initial screenings for trehalose secretion, the best performing C. necator (pSEVA228-setA) strain was next characterized in shake flasks using different substrates. It was of special interest to analyze whether trehalose formation is a general feature in conditions of salt stress for this organism. Apart from fructose which is metabolized by the Entner-Doudoroff pathway in C. necator, acetate and succinate were also used as substrates as this will cause C. necator to run gluconeogenesis. In addition, glycerol was tested as a cheap substrate that can be metabolized natively by C. necator, and even acts as a good substrate when the strain is engineered in this respect (Fukui et al., 2014). The results of these shake flask experiments are shown in Fig. 4 . These experiments clearly show that trehalose can also be produced and secreted using non-carbohydrate substrates. Trehalose production from carbohydrates is an already established process (Ohtake and Wang, 2011), thus using alternative substrates, like glycerol might be an interesting alternative. Growth on glycerol of wild-type C. necator was extremely slow in our experiments as has also been previously reported by others (Fukui et al., 2014). After a very long lag-phase of more than 7 days, the culture was only captured after reaching stationary phase 15 days after inoculation. Nevertheless, the mere production of trehalose could be shown in this case from glycerol as well. Table 3 summarizes the concentrations of trehalose formed, the cell dry weight and the respective product/substrate yields for all the substrates after reaching the stationary phase. In case of glycerol, only the final value could be measured and be taken into consideration for estimating the yields and cell dry weights. Fructose and succinate lead to higher biomass and trehalose yields than acetate, which makes sense when considering its metabolism: Using Acetyl-CoA synthetase, 2 equivalents of ATP are necessary for the conversion of acetate to Acetyl-CoA which in turn has to be processed via the glyoxylate-shunt to succinate. This means that directly using succinate as a substrate “costs” the cell 4 ATP less than the equivalent of acetate. Even when considering that one NADH is generated in the glyoxylate shunt, succinate will be the more energy efficient substrate per gram and also requires fewer enzymatic conversion steps and hence less protein investment by the cells. The product/substrate yield YP/S of glycerol is probably slightly overestimated since there should have been some evaporation of cultivation medium after 15 days that is difficult to measure. However, the value of 0.137 is in line with the yield of fructose that also enters the metabolism at a similar level (i.e. glycerol is directly converted into a C3-sugar). The product/substrate yields of around 0.1 g g−1 for fructose, succinate and glycerol are excellent starting values for further optimization: It has to be stressed that by the expression of setA, only a pull strategy was implemented – i.e. trehalose production is increased by draining the product from the cell – but did not yet push the flux in the direction of trehalose. Enforcing the flux in the direction of trehalose by overexpression of the trehalose synthesis genes, for example otsA and otsB, should increase the production rate and yields considerably. This will be part of future research projects."
15,Production of trehalose from a H2/CO2 mixture by engineered strains,"3.7 Production of trehalose from a H2/CO2 mixture by engineered strains Finally, the production of trehalose with C. necator H16 (pSEVA228-setA) from gaseous substrates was tested. Cultivations with a H2/CO2/O2 gas-mixture in modified MR-medium resulted in formation of up to around 0.47 g L−1 trehalose when using 150 mM NaCl as depicted in Fig. 5 . No side product formation was observed. Lower salt concentrations resulted in lower trehalose production while higher salt concentrations led to higher trehalose and lower biomass formation. These data confirm the salt dependence of trehalose formation in this strain from gaseous substrates as well. As it was not possible to measure residual hydrogen and leakage of hydrogen in the gas phase, it was difficult to estimate the yields of trehalose. Judging from the ratio of trehalose and biomass, the cultivations with the gas mixture as substrate formed 0.434 g trehalose per gram of biomass, which is in the same order of magnitude as for the heterotrophic substrates (0.233 g g−1 for acetate, 0.279 for succinate, 0.233 for fructose and 0.305 for glycerol). In fact, when fed on gaseous substrates, more carbon was directed to trehalose than in the heterotrophic cultivations. However, flocculation of biomass in the gas-based fermentations was observed and thus the value might be over-estimated. Using the very simplified assumption that trehalose and biomass have similar yields from hydrogen and that a stoichiometry of 3.154 g(CDW)/mol(H2) can be reached as determined in former studies (Tanaka et al., 1995), the product/substrate yield can be estimated to be in the order of 0.953 g (Trehalose)/mol(H2). How does that compare to the maximal theoretical yield? If one assumes that the Calvin cycle needs around 9–12 ATP to form one mol of glyeraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) (Bar-Even et al., 2010) and ATP can be generated from hydrogen with a stoichiometry of 2.5 ATP/H2 (using the cytoplasmic hydrogenase of C. necator H16 and a ATP/NADH ratio of 2.5), a maximal yield of 1 mol trehalose per 26.8–31.6 mol H2 is obtained which equals to 10.8–12.8 g(Trehalose)/mol(H2). Therefore, it can be estimated that 7.5–8.8% of the maximal theoretical yield was reached in the experiments. Even though increased trehalose formation was not yet engineered in this work, but just leakage from the cell, this yield is already a good starting point and it can be expected to come closer to the maximal values when further metabolic engineering is applied."
16,Applications of trehalose produced from gaseous substrates,"3.8 Applications of trehalose produced from gaseous substrates Trehalose is used by the food and pharma industry and is more valuable than, for example, glucose or sucrose (food grade trehalose sells for ~3$/kg (O’Brien-Nabors, 2016) in contrast to glucose and sucrose that sell below 1$/kg (Elvers, 2017)), but also than other products like ethanol or methanol (Straathof and Bampouli, 2017) that can be produced from synthesis gas and are already commercialized. Apart from that, the process is well suited for the production of 13C-labeled sugar since the price of 13C-labeled CO2 is magnitudes lower per carbon and by using a surplus of hydrogen, a high yield of labelled sugar from 13CO2 should be possible. Another interesting use-case are scenarios where hydrogen gas and electricity are available, but space is sparse like on space missions: edible sugar could be produced without the need of large areas for plant growth and with a possibly better efficiency. While finalizing this manuscript for publication, a similar study had been published on bioRxiv (Nangle et al., 2020) in which, among other products, sucrose was produced from a gaseous mixture by expression of sucrose synthesis genes and a sucrose porin in C. necator. Sugar produced from CO2 was successfully used to feed heterotrophic processes as shown by Nangle et al. and former studies (Ducat et al., 2012; Löwe et al., 2017), but this biotechnologically produced sugar (by S. elongatus or C. necator) will likely be too expensive in the beginning in a commercial setting. Therefore, engineering C. necator and other hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria directly will probably be the better route."
17,Conclusion,"In this study, the production of the sugar trehalose from carbon dioxide, hydrogen and oxygen gas was shown by engineering the hydrogen-oxidizing bacterium C.necator H16 for trehalose leakage. Sugar secretion with the sugar efflux transporter A from E. coli thus allows for many promising applications. Compared to other hydrogen utilizing microorganisms like acetogens or methanogens, hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria can breathe oxygen and thereby generate the required ATP. Therefore, a lot more processes for the production of ATP-demanding compounds in the future with this remarkable class of microorganisms should be investigated."
