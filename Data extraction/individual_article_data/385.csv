0,Introduction,"Energy from various renewable resources can be chemically stored as hydrogen, which can generate electric power via a hydrogen fuel cell system when required [1–3]. Hence, hydrogen is a promising energy carrier with high energy density and environmentally friendly properties. However, because hydrogen is a highly flammable gas, there are difficulties involved in its storage and transportation. To overcome these problems, the use of a liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) has been suggested [4]. Formic acid (HCOOH; FA), which can produce and transport hydrogen via hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions, is a stable LOHC with high hydrogen density (4.4 wt% and 53 g/L) [5–9]. Furthermore, it is obtained from biomass processes and direct conversion of H2 and CO2 [5–8,10–14]. Therefore, developing appropriate catalysts to produce hydrogen efficiently from FA will promote the practical use of FA as a hydrogen source or LOHC. Particularly for heterogeneous catalysis of formic acid dehydrogenation (FAD, HCOOH → H2 + CO2) to produce hydrogen, palladium-based catalysts typically demonstrate high performance.[7,15,16]. However, because of the high cost of palladium (Pd), developing an improved catalyst through an efficient synthesis process is highly required. Catalysts can be designed rationally when understanding the reaction mechanism and catalytic factors affecting the activity. Previously, we determined that the reaction pathway of FAD is the formate anion dehydrogenation pathway, which starts with the adsorption of formate anions (HCOO–) on Pd, and that the combinative desorption of hydrogen (H* + H* → H2 + 2*) is the rate-determining step [17]. The catalytic factors have been investigated in various previous studies, including ours. Small Pd is advantageous because it ensures a large number of active sites [18–22] and even alleviates the activation barrier of FAD [18,23]. Functional groups/metal oxides are frequently introduced into the catalyst to reduce the size of Pd and to modify the electronic structure of Pd via strong interaction between the functional groups/metal oxides and Pd [20,21,24–34]. Moreover, certain functional groups such as amine (NH2–) exhibit a proton-scavenging effect, which captures protons (H+) from FA to generate formate anions (HCOO–) [7,21,24,25,28,30,32,35–37]. The formation of the formate anions improves the catalytic activity, because the formate anion is the initial reactant of FAD [17]. In addition, it has been reported that the fouling of reactants and products within the micropores of catalysts or on the catalyst surfaces is a major deactivation factor for the FAD reaction [38–42]. In this study, based on this understanding, we rationally designed a highly active catalyst for FAD and established a method for preparing the designed catalyst. In detail, since carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have recently attracted attention due to their unique tubular morphology and π-electron density, CNTs were adopted as a support. Moreover, the absence of micropores would facilitate the mass transport of reactants or products that can be fouled within the micropores [38]. Generally, to prepare metal-impregnated CNT catalysts with ultrafine nanoparticles, distinctive preparation methods are required due to the hydrophobic nature of CNTs, such as functionalizing the CNT prior to metal impregnation or using acetonic/alcoholic solutions [43–48]. However, to facilely prepare the catalyst via a conventional chemical reduction method using NaBH4 aqueous solution, we utilized (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES), which has both a hydrophobic methyl group and a hydrophilic amine group, to overcome the hydrophobicity of CNTs [15,20,36]. APTES was also expected to introduce amine functional groups into CNTs [15,20,27,30]. Moreover, the synthetic process was carried out at ∼ 2 °C in the presence of trisodium citrate (Cit), a stabilizing agent, resulting in a smaller Pd size [7]. Consequently, the prepared catalyst can have ultrafine Pd nanoparticles with an average Pd size of 1.76 nm, resulting in the desirable catalytic activity for FAD with high turnover frequency values of 2560 h−1 at 30 °C and 8137 h−1 at 50 °C."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Commercially available chemicals were used without further treatment. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs, MR99) were purchased from Carbon Nano-material Technology (Korea). Palladium(II) chloride (Pd(Cl)2, 99%), (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES > 99%), trisodium citrate (Cit, ≥99.9%), sodium borohydride (NaBH4, ≥98.0%), formic acid (HCOOH ≥ 98%), sodium formate (HCOONa, ≥99.0%), and activated carbon were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 35.0–37.0%) was purchased from Samchun Pure Chemical Co. (Korea). Water was distilled and deionized to obtain Milli-Q water with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ·cm. Moreover, 0.05 M of H2PdCl4 solution was prepared in advance by dissolving PdCl2 in 0.5 M HCl (at 1:10 M ratio)."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation For the facile preparation of catalysts, a conventional chemical reduction method using NaBH4 in the aqueous solution was adopted. In detail, 0.5 g of CNTs was dispersed in 150 mL water, and 1 g of Cit and 0.6 mL of APTES were added to the solution. The mixture was sonicated for 10 min and stirred for 0.5 h at 1000 rpm to disperse CNTs. Subsequently, 5 mL of 0.05 M H2PdCl4 was added to the solution. After an additional 0.5 h stirring at 1000 rpm, a NaBH4 solution (0.15 g NaBH4 in 30 mL of Milli-Q water) was introduced dropwise. The resulting suspension was stirred for 0.5 h to fully reduce Pd ions. Subsequently, the catalyst was washed using 4 L of Milli-Q water and dried for 16 h in an oven at 105 °C. It should be noted that the synthetic temperature was maintained at ∼ 2 °C, as the low temperature ensures higher catalytic activity by forming a smaller Pd size (Fig. S1 in the Supporting Information). The concentrations of Cit and APTES were optimized (Figs. S2 and S3). Moreover, it was confirmed that the time for each preparation step barely affected the catalytic activity (Fig. S4). In order to investigate the effect of Cit and APTES, the catalysts were prepared without either Cit or APTES, and with either Cit or APTES."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization 2.3.1 Transmission electron microscopy Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a JEM-ARM200F (Cs-TEM) equipped with a cold field emission gun and a spherical aberration corrector in an objective lens operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Spherical aberration enabled the observation of ultrafine Pd nanoparticles with a point resolution of 0.11 nm in TEM mode. The particle size distribution and average size of Pd particles were obtained by calculating > 200 Pd particles. 2.3.2 High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were acquired using a JEM-ARM200F (Cs-STEM) equipped with a cold field emission gun and a spherical aberration corrector in a condenser lens operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. To confirm the presence of single atoms, HAADF-STEM images were taken. Moreover, the distribution of C, N, Si, and Pd was investigated by energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping. 2.3.3 Pulsed-CO chemisorption To measure the dispersion and average size of Pd in the catalysts, pulsed-CO chemisorption was performed using a BEL-CAT-II catalyst analyzer (BEL Japan). The catalysts were pretreated with 5 vol% of H2/Ar at 150 °C for 0.5 h. Then, the adsorption of pulsed-CO was carried out at 50 °C, and the amount of adsorbed CO was quantified. The dispersion and average Pd size were calculated based on a stoichiometric Pd/CO ratio of 2. 2.3.4 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the catalysts in the regions of C1s, N1s, Si2p, and Pd3d was carried out using a K-alpha instrument (Thermo Scientific, UK) equipped with AlKα µ-focused monochromatic radiation (1486.6 eV) at a current of 3 mA and a voltage of 12 kV. The binding energies were calibrated by correcting the binding energy of C1s of each sample at 284.5 eV. 2.3.5 N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were determined at –196 °C by a BELSORP-mini II with high-precision surface area and a pore size analyzer (BEL Japan). The specific surface areas and pore size distribution were analyzed using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda methods, respectively. 2.3.6 Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy The Pd contents were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) with a Shimadzu Model ICPS-8100 instrument. To dissolve Pd from the catalysts, they were pretreated in aqua regia (3:1 volumetric ratio of HCl and HNO3) at 95 °C for 4 h. Subsequently, the solution was filtered to remove support powder and diluted for analysis. 2.3.7 X-ray diffraction X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a powder X-ray diffractometer (Smartlab, Rigaku) while maintaining current at 30 mA and voltage at 40 kV. To obtain high-resolution profiles, 1.0°/min scan speed and 0.2° step size were adopted. 2.3.8 X-ray absorption fine structure X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectra of the catalysts were taken from the 7D-XAFS beamline of the Pohang Light Source (PLS-II) at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (South Korea). The monochromator was a Si (111) crystal with a beam energy of 2.5 GeV and a ring current of 300 mA. The X-ray signal was collected at room temperature. The energies of the incident (I 0) and fluorescent (I f) beams were measured while the ionization chamber was purged with N2 gas. The energy was calibrated using Pd foil (E 0 = 24,350 eV). The step and duration time of the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) were 1.0 eV and 2 s, respectively. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data were processed using the Athena program (Demeter, US). 2.3.9 Fourier-transformed infrared Gas-phase spectroscopy was carried out using a Fourier-transformed infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer (Nicolet iS50, Thermo Scientific) having a 2-m gas cell to analyze gases generated during FAD reactions. The generated gas was captured in a Tedlar gas sampling bag and transferred into the FT-IR cell. A small amount of water vaporized from the reactant solution was detected while the generated gas was analyzed by FT-IR. The reference gases were introduced into the FT-IR cell with target composition controlled by a mass flow meter. The compositions of the reference gases were determined as 20 ppm and 50 ppm CO gases and a mixture gas of CO and CO2 for comparison."
5,Reaction test,"2.4 Reaction test Hydrogen generation from formic acid was tested by a semi-batch reactor, as adopted in previous studies [17,18]. One neck of a two-necked reactor was connected to a burette which was filled with mineral oil, and the other was closed with a rubber septum. The target amount of catalyst containing 11.75 μmol of Pd was loaded in the reactor, whose temperature was controlled by the water bath. The catalysts were gently ground in a mortar after drying, and they were used as prepared. Hence, the powder size of Pd/CNTs would be similar to the size of carbon nanotubes (∼10 nm thickness and ∼ 10 µm length), while that of Pd/C would be the size of activated carbon (<140 µm). Lefferts et al. have systematically shown that a trace of oxygen can suppress the deactivation of Pd/Al2O3 by CO [49], but we have demonstrated several times that the air conditions and hydrogen conditions barely affect the catalytic activity of Pd/C [17,18]. The difference in oxygen effect would originate from the different supports (Fig. S5). Hence, for convenience, the catalysts were not reduced and the reaction system was not purged. Various reactant solutions were prepared with different ratios and concentrations of FA and SF, and the reactant solution was maintained at the reaction temperature in an oven. Then 9 mL of the reactant solution was injected into a closed rubber septum via syringe. All reactions were carried out with vigorous stirring at 1000 rpm to avoid external mass transport limitations. When the reaction started, the generated gas extruded the mineral oil in the burette. The mass of extruded oil was measured by a compacted balance every 3 s. Then the mass value was converted to volume by the density of mineral oil (0.838 g/mL). This reaction system demonstrated the high reproducibility and reliability of our previous studies [17,18]. The conversion of FA at each time can be calculated from the molar number of the generated gas, since the total reaction of formic acid dehydrogenation is HCOOH → H2 + CO2. This is available because no side reaction such as dehydration occurred under our reaction conditions, as will be demonstrated by FT-IR analysis."
6,Turnover frequency,"2.5 Turnover frequency The TOF was calculated based on the total number of Pd atoms (bulk Pd atoms) using the following equation: T O F h - 1 = P ∙ V R ∙ T 2 N ∙ t . P is the atmospheric pressure (1 atm), V is the volume of gas generated during the reaction until the conversion of FA reached 20%, R is the gas constant (0.082 L·atm·K−1·mol−1), T is the temperature of the gas that is reasonably assumed as the room temperature (298 K), N is the total number of Pd (11.75 μmol), and t is the time that was required for 20 % conversion of FA. Note that TOF values were calculated at 20% conversion of FA, because the reaction was carried out by a semi-batch reactor."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Synthetic strategy to immobilize ultrafine Pd particles on carbon nanotubes,"3.1 Synthetic strategy to immobilize ultrafine Pd particles on carbon nanotubes The immobilization of ultrafine particles on CNTs requires specific methods, because of the hydrophobicity of CNTs, which are composed solely of carbon without any functional groups [50]. Common approaches are doping functional groups or using alcohol/acetone as a solvent [43–48]. Here, we adopted APTES to overcome the hydrophobicity of CNTs in order to immobilize ultrasmall Pd particles on CNTs. A strategy for synthesizing ultrafine Pd nanoparticles impregnated on amine-functionalized CNTs (NH2-CNTs) is described simply in Scheme 1 . The Pd precursor, CNTs, APTES, and Cit were dispersed in aqueous solution while stirring vigorously. The hydrolysis of APTES, consisting of Si–O–CH2CH3, would occur readily in the presence of water to form Si–O–Si bonds, resulting in APTES-coated CNTs. Meanwhile, Pd particles were impregnated on the support from the nucleation of the Pd precursor by NaBH4 reduction. During the growth of nucleated Pd particles, both Cit and APTES would prevent severe agglomeration of Pd particles by stabilizing Pd precursors and reducing surface instability of nucleated particles. Moreover, all synthetic processes were performed at ∼ 2 °C, where particle growth was limited by the slow reduction of Pd precursor [51,52], resulting in enhanced catalytic activity (Fig. S1). Because the concentrations of Cit and APTES also affect the Pd size, which determines the catalytic performance [20,27,28,51], their concentrations were optimized (Figs. S2 and S3). The stirring and reduction time during the preparation barely influenced the catalytic performance (Fig. S4). The catalyst is denoted as Pd/CNT, and if either Cit or APTES was used, it is described in the parentheses. Furthermore, to confirm the advantage of using CNTs, Pd supported on activated carbon catalysts was also prepared in the same manner and compared. The roles of Cit and APTES in the formation of Pd nanoparticles were concretely investigated using TEM, as shown in Fig. 1 . The outer diameters of CNT ranged from 10 to 20 nm (Fig. S6). When Pd was impregnated onto CNTs without Cit and APTES, severely aggregated Pd particles were mainly observed, and a small number of ∼ 3-nm-sized Pd particles were also observed (Fig. 1a). Although the particle size distribution of this catalyst is obtained, the average Pd size was not calculated due to inaccuracy caused by the bimodal distribution. Instead, the average Pd size was identified as 13.9 nm by CO chemisorption. The presence of Cit lowered the surface instability of Pd nanoparticles during the Pd impregnation [53], preventing the severe agglomeration of the Pd particles and keeping the size of Pd particles in Pd/CNTs (Cit) small, with an average of 2.93 nm (Fig. 1b). When Pd particles were impregnated on activated carbon that contains innate functional groups, notably smaller Pd particles with an average size of 2.09 nm were produced (Fig. S7b). The different Pd sizes formed on CNTs and activated carbon are attributed to the hydrophobicity of CNTs, which limits the formation of ultrafine Pd nanoparticles on CNTs [50]. To overcome the hydrophobicity of CNTs, APTES, having both a hydrophobic methyl group and a hydrophilic amine group, was utilized. The presence of APTES during Pd impregnation on CNTs reduced the size of Pd particles to an average of 2.03 nm (Fig. 1c). The Pd size was further reduced by utilizing both Cit and APTES, so this catalyst was composed of ultrafine Pd nanoparticles with an average size of 1.76 nm (Fig. 1d). This demonstrates the synergetic effects of Cit and APTES on the impregnation of ultrafine Pd particles onto CNT. Note that the average sizes determined from TEM images were consistent with those obtained by CO chemisorption (Table 1 )."
9,Amine functional groups on carbon nanotubes,"3.2 Amine functional groups on carbon nanotubes As mentioned above, the hydrolysis of APTES forms Si–O–Si bonds between APTES, and subsequently, an APTES layer would cover CNTs. Meanwhile, Cit is a representative stabilizing agent that is easily removed by water filtration [19]. Cit would not exist in the prepared catalysts. The TEM images of CNTs and Pd/CNTs (Cit and APTES) show the form of the APTES-introduced catalyst. While CNTs had a pristine surface, Pd/CNTs (Cit and APTES) contained Pd particles and thin layers (Fig. 2 a). The HAADF-STEM images in Fig. 2b and 2c demonstrate that most Pd exists in the form of ultrafine Pd nanoparticles, while a few single Pd atoms indicated by orange arrows also exist. Some previous research reported that single Pd atoms are notably active toward the gaseous formic acid dehydrogenation reaction [54,55]. Nevertheless, since the number of Pd particles greatly exceeded that of single atoms, as identified by STEM images, and gaseous formic acid dehydrogenation differs from the aqueous phase reaction [17], the effect of single Pd atoms may be neglected in this catalyst. Meanwhile, the EDS mapping in Fig. 2c shows that nitrogen and silicon were widely distributed over the CNTs. The composition of this thin layer was further confirmed by XPS in the N1s and Si2p regions, as shown in Fig. 2d and 2e, respectively. Whereas CNTs displayed no characteristic peaks in those regions, Pd/CNTs (APTES) and Pd/CNTs (Cit and APTES) exhibited characteristic peaks related to nitrogen and silicon species. The single peak at ∼ 400 eV in the N1s region was attributed to C–NH2 [15,27,28], and one peak at ∼ 102 eV in the Si2p region arose from silane [56,57]. These results confirm that the APTES consisting of C–NH2 and silane was successfully coated on CNTs, resulting in amine-functionalized CNTs (NH2-CNTs). These amine functional groups changed the hydrophobicity of the catalysts. The water droplets were maintained for a while on the pelletized Pd/CNTs, but the pelletized Pd/CNTs (Cit and APTES) absorbed the water droplets immediately (Fig. 3 ), showing that the amine functional groups improved the hydrophilicity of CNT. Also, it is notable that, when Pd was impregnated on CNTs previously treated by APTES, the catalytic activity was lower than that of Pd/CNTs (Cit and APTES) (Fig. S8). This indicates that, in addition to a role in providing amine functional groups, APTES had a role in generating smaller Pd particles by stabilizing Pd precursors and Pd particles during the synthetic process as a stabilizing agent, similar to Cit. In summary, the combination of Cit and APTES enabled the impregnation of ultrafine Pd nanoparticles with an average size of 1.76 nm onto amine-functionalized CNTs. Both the Pd nanoparticles and the amine functional groups were contiguously distributed, as shown by STEM-EDS mapping in Fig. 2c. Their close contact was confirmed by electron transfer between them in the XPS spectra of the Pd/CNTs (APTES) and Pd/CNTs (Cit and APTES), as shown in Fig. 4 a. Specifically, the Pd0 peak was shifted to a higher binding energy due to interaction with amine functional groups, which typically improved the catalytic activity of Pd for the FAD reaction [27,58–60]. Notably, the high proportion of Pd2+ was attributed to the small Pd, which has a higher proportion of readily oxidized surface Pd atoms [17,18,27,52]. This is evidenced by the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra in Fig. 4b. The Pd–O peak at 1.5 Å originating from the surface Pd atoms interacting with oxygen was similar between Pd/CNTs catalysts, whereas the Pd–Pd peak at 2.5 Å originating from the bulk Pd atoms was considerably reduced in the catalyst with a small Pd size. Moreover, it should be noted that the white lines of XANES in Fig. 4c were quite similar between Pd/CNTs (Cit), Pd/CNTs (APTES), and Pd/CNTs (Cit and APTES), but the Pd2+ peak in the XPS of the catalysts with the amine functional groups was much more pronounced. This result also indicates the strong interaction between Pd and amine functional groups in the catalysts, possibly attributable to Pd–N interaction."
10,The effect of Pd size and amine functional groups on catalytic activity,"3.3 The effect of Pd size and amine functional groups on catalytic activity The activities of these catalysts for the FAD reaction were measured using two different reactants: FA only and a FA/SF mixture solution, as shown in Fig. 5 a and b, respectively. It should be recalled that, since the FAD follows the formate anion dehydrogenation pathway where the reaction starts with the adsorption of HCOO–, the concentration of HCOO– critically affects the catalytic activity of FAD [17]. In this regard, SF is a typical additive used to improve the FAD activity by producing HCOO–. Pd/CNTs with mostly aggregated Pd particles exhibited negligible catalytic activity with both reactants. This is because the large Pd particles have a small number of active surface atoms, and it is thermodynamically difficult to desorb hydrogen from them [18,23,61]. Pd/CNTs (Cit) with 2.93 nm average-sized Pd particles showed catalytic activity only when the FA/SF mixture was used as a reactant. Due to the negligible concentration of HCOO– in the FA-only solution, the catalytic activity was only noticeable in an FA/SF mixture solution having a considerably higher concentration of HCOO–. Meanwhile, Pd/CNTs (APTES) and Pd/CNTs (Cit and APTES) demonstrated high catalytic activities for both FA-only and FA/SF mixture reactants, although the activity of Pd/CNTs (Cit and APTES) was higher than that of Pd/CNTs (APTES) due to smaller Pd size. It is a meaningful result that the catalysts with amine functional groups were highly active even for the FA-only reactant. This can be attributed to the proton scavenging effect of amine functional groups, which traps protons from formic acid to generate HCOO– near Pd particles, resulting in significant catalytic activity even in the FA-only reactant, which contained a low concentration of HCOO–. The different catalytic activity of the catalysts with and without amine functional groups for the FA-only reactant solution is strong experimental evidence of the proton-scavenging effect of the amine functional groups. On the other hand, similar-sized Pd particles were impregnated onto APTES-coated activated carbon to confirm the advantage of using CNTs that have no micropores. This Pd/C (APTES) catalyst displayed noticeably lower catalytic activity than Pd/CNTs (Cit and APTES) despite the presence of amine functional groups and the similar size of Pd particles (Table S2 and Fig. S11), indicating that CNTs are a superior support to activated carbon. The textural properties of CNTs and activated carbon were analyzed by N2 adsorption–desorption to find out the origin of the higher catalytic activity of Pd/CNTs (Cit and APTES; Fig. S12). The surface areas of CNTs and activated carbon decreased after APTES coating and Pd impregnation, but their characteristic textural properties, such as the pore size distribution, were maintained. In particular, the micropores were still present in the activated carbon. There are several studies showing that the micropores are inappropriate to facilitate mass transport, resulting in hampered catalytic activity compared with the catalyst with mesopores [31,37,62–64]. Therefore, it can be deduced that the absence of micropores in CNTs would facilitate mass transport. To summarize, because of the minimized Pd size, the promoting effect of the amine functional groups, and the absence of micropores in CNTs, Pd/CNTs (Cit and APTES) demonstrated the highest catalytic activity among the prepared catalysts. For simplicity, this Pd/CNTs (Cit and APTES) catalyst was renamed Pd/NH2-CNT."
11,Catalytic tests of Pd/NH2-CNT under various conditions,"3.4 Catalytic tests of Pd/NH2-CNT under various conditions A series of reactions were carried out over the prepared catalysts under various conditions for further investigation. As the catalytic activity was significantly dependent on the reactant composition, the influence of FA and SF was tested by varying the concentration of each reactant (Figs. S14 and S15). When 0.5 M SF was introduced into the 0.5 M FA-only reactant, the catalytic activity was significantly increased, with the turnover frequency (TOF) values at 50 °C changing from 5791 to 7281 h−1, as shown in Fig. 6 a and c. However, further increase in the SF concentration above 0.5 M barely impacted the activity of Pd/NH2-CNT. The activity of the catalysts without amine functional groups continuously increased with the SF concentration (Fig. S14), showing the difference originating from the proton scavenging effect. Since, in the presence of SF, the concentration of formate anions would easily be saturated near the Pd particles by the amine functional groups, the catalytic activity was not changed with increasing SF concentration. Meanwhile, the SF-only solution demonstrated a greatly retarded hydrogen production rate due to low concentration of H+, as shown in Fig. 6b and c. When 0.5 M FA was added to the 2.0 M SF-only solution, the catalytic activity was abruptly improved from 176 to 8137 h−1. Then it was increased steadily with increasing FA concentration from 0.5 M to 2 M. The catalytic performance of Pd/NH2-CNT at different temperatures was measured using the FA-only and FA/SF mixture solutions, as shown in Fig. 7 a and b. Naturally, the catalytic performances improved steadily when the reaction temperature was ramped. The TOF values observed over this catalyst were 1544 h−1 at 30 °C and 5791 h−1 at 50 °C in the absence of SF, and 2560 h−1 at 30 °C and 8137 h−1 at 50 °C in the presence of SF (Fig. 7c). These are among the highest values when compared with the previously reported catalysts (Table S3). Moreover, even a trace of CO, which can be unfavorably generated via dehydration of FA, was not detected in the product gases, with a detection limit of 10 ppm CO (Fig. S16). The activation energies of several catalysts were calculated from the Arrhenius correlation with the various reactant compositions in Fig. 8 (Figs S17–S21). Note that the values in Fig. 8 are not the real activation barrier, which is determined only by the rate-determining step, but they are the apparent activation energies that each reaction step can affect. Hence, the changes in the apparent activation barrier can originate from the change in each of the steps. Similarly to the catalytic activities, the activation energy for the FAD reaction was dependent on the presence of SF. When the activation energies of FA-only and FA/SF mixture solutions were compared, the FA/SF mixture solution demonstrated lower activation energy. As the FA-only solution has a low concentration of HCOO–, it requires additional energy for deprotonation. Meanwhile, FA/SF mixture solutions do not require the activation energy for deprotonation, due to a sufficient amount of HCOO– being present [17,62]. This indicates that the deprotonation ability of the amine functional groups was temperature-dependent, similarly to the deprotonation equilibrium of HCOOH. Meanwhile, the mass transport limitation, which would occur significantly more for a microporous carbon support, lowers the apparent activation energy [65]. If the activation barriers of the FAD reaction excluding mass transport over CNT-supported and carbon-supported catalysts were the same, the apparent activation energy should be lower over carbon-supported catalysts due to limited mass transport in micropores of carbon. However, despite the mass transport limitation, carbon-supported catalysts had higher apparent activation energies than CNT-supported catalysts. This result indicates that CNT-supported catalysts have lower activation barriers for the FAD reaction excluding mass transport than carbon-supported catalysts. Therefore, it is concluded that the electronic effect of CNTs on Pd is another advantage leading to the lower activation barrier of the FAD reaction over CNT-supported catalysts than over carbon-supported catalysts."
12,Repeated use of catalysts,"3.5 Repeated use of catalysts To provide insights for practical application, the consecutive FAD reactions were performed with and without the regeneration process, as shown in Fig. 9 . For the catalytic test with the regeneration process, Pd/NH2-CNT was regenerated by washing with water and drying overnight at 105 °C after each reaction. The catalytic activity of Pd/NH2-CNT was steadily reduced when the catalyst was regenerated, mainly due to the sintering of Pd particles (Fig. S22), but the catalytic activity was still high even at the fourth period. The catalytic test without the regeneration process was performed over the same Pd/NH2-CNT catalyst. In detail, the Pd/NH2-CNT catalyst was dispersed in the 2.0 M SF solution, and subsequently, the pure FA equivalent amount of the 0.5 M FA was injected. After the reaction was terminated (any gas was not generated), the same amount of the pure FA was re-injected. Without the regeneration process involving washing and drying, the catalytic activity was considerably diminished just after the second injection of the FA, and furthermore, the reaction was completely terminated despite the presence of the reactant. No additional gas was produced after the third injection of FA, indicating that the catalyst was completely deactivated. Such distinctive deactivation behavior observed in the case without a regeneration process could be attributed to either the fouling of reactants/products on Pd or the accumulation of CO adsorbed on Pd as critical deactivation factors, as demonstrated by many previous studies [38–42,49]. Therefore, the cyclic regeneration involving washing and drying should be carried out in the practical application of the FAD reaction. It is also noted that the stability is the drawback of Pd/NH2-CNT, but we expect that, in the near future, such deactivation can be overcome by additional treatment such as a mesoporous silica coating that prevents Pd sintering.[43]"
13,Conclusion,"Based on the understanding of the FAD reaction, Pd/NH2-CNT was rationally prepared. Pd/NH2-CNT demonstrated extraordinary catalytic activity for FAD, with TOF values of 2560 h−1 at 30 °C and 8137 h−1 at 50 °C. Systematic investigation confirmed that this desirable catalytic performance was attributable to the minimized Pd size, the promoting effect of the amine -functional groups, and the absence of micropores in CNTs. This study provides a strategy to develop a highly active and low-cost catalyst and suggests the necessity of the regeneration process for repeated usage. This would provide insights for developing the practical application of a hydrogen production and storage system using formic acid in the near future."
