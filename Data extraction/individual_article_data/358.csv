0,Introduction,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an environmentally benign oxidant, being widely used for pulp- and paper-bleaching [1,2], wastewater treatment [3–6], oxidation of substrates [7–14], and fuel in fuel cells [15–20]. H2O2 is currently manufactured mainly by the anthraquinone process, in which an anthraquinone (such as 2-ethylanthraquinone or the 2-amyl derivative) is reduced by hydrogen (H2) to the corresponding anthrahydroquinone using a palladium catalyst [21–23]. The anthrahydroquinone then undergoes autoxidation by dioxygen (O2) to generate H2O2, accompanied by re-production of the anthraquinone. The high cost of the anthraquinone process resulting from recycling of the extraction solvents, the hydrogenation catalyst and the expensive quinone has precluded the much wider use of H2O2 as a green oxidant and fuel. Direct synthesis of H2O2 from a mixture of H2 and O2 has provided an alternative route for the on-site generation [24–29]. However, H2 and O2 gases need to be diluted in high-pressure CO2 or N2 solution to prevent serious fire hazard, substantially lowering the yields of H2O2 [24–29]. On the other hand, electrochemical 2e− reduction of O2 has received increasing attention because of the research development on fuel cells [30–37]. A direct electrosynthesis strategy has recently been reported by delivering separate H2 and O2 streams to an anode and cathode parted by a porous solid electrolyte, wherein the electrochemically formed H+ and HO2 − recombine to produce pure aqueous H2O2 solutions [38]. Because of the high cost of storage and transport of hydrogen gas, the electrolyzer type cell is preferred. However, higher cell voltages and electricity cost are required to drive the reaction to produce H2O2 [38]. Thus, the production of H2O2 by photocatalysis is a more sustainable process, because H2O and O2 are the earth-abundant and environmentally benign source materials and solar-light is used as the energy to drive the reaction between H2O and O2 [39–49]. This review focuses on recent mechanistic insights in solar-light-driven H2O2 production by oxidation of H2O and by reduction of O2 as well as the usage of H2O2 as a green oxidant and fuel."
1,4e− H2O oxidation combined with 2e− O2 reduction,"The first example of the photocatalytic H2O2 production by 4e− H2O oxidation combined with 2e− O2 reduction without hole scavengers was reported by combination of photoinduced electron transfer (ET) from the excited state of Ru(II) complex, [RuII(4,7-Me2phen)3]2+* (* denotes the excited state and 4,7-Me2phen = 4,7-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline) to O2 in the presence of an acid and the catalytic 4e− oxidation of H2O by [RuIII(4,7-Me2phen)3]3+ with a H2O oxidation catalyst (WOC) as shown in Scheme 1 [50]. ET from the photoexcited state of Ru(II) complex (Ru2+*) to O2 produces Ru(III) complex and O2 •– species. O2 •– is protonated in the presence of an acid to produce hydrogen peroxyl radical (HO2 •), which disproportionates to yield H2O2 and O2 [50]. A diversity of metal complexes and nanoparticles (NPs) is capable of catalyzing the 4e−/4H+ H2O oxidation by the Ru(II) photocatalyst to produce O2 [51–61]. Hence, the net reaction of the photocatalytic 2e−/2H+ O2 reduction and the catalytic 4e−/4H+ H2O oxidation is the photocatalytic H2O oxidation combined with O2 reduction to produce H2O2 [50]. When [(Cp*)(bpy)CoIII(H2O)]2+ (bpy = 2,2’-bipyridine and Cp* = η5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) was used as a WOC with a photocatalyst, [RuII(4,7-Me2phen)3]2+, for the 2e−/2H+ O2 reduction in H2O containing ScIII(NO3)3, the quantum yield (Φ) of the photocatalytic H2O2 production at λ = 450 nm was determined as 37% [50]. The solar energy conversion efficiency of H2O2 production was determined using simulated solar-light (1 sun) to be 0.25% [50]. The solar-light-driven H2O2 production proceeds via photoinduced ET from the Ru(II)* to O2 to produce Ru(III) complex and O2 •– species that binds to Sc3+ to produce O2 •–-Sc3+ [62–64], which disproportionates in H2O to yield H2O2, while H2O is oxidized to O2 by four equivalents of Ru(III) photocatalyst with a WOC [50]. The photodriven production of H2O2 by oxidation of H2O by O2 was also achieved using NiFe2O4 NPs composed of earth-abundant metal ions as a WOC [65], [RuII(4,7-Me2phen)3]2+ as a photocatalyst in H2O containing ScIII(NO3)3 under visible-light illumination (λ > 420 nm) (Fig. 1(a) ) [66]. NiFe2O4 NPs catalyst could be recycled by repeatedly adding Ru(II) complex to the reaction solution after cessation of production of H2O2 due to the decomposition of Ru(II) complex. The H2O2 concentration increased to reach 3.3 mM, indicating the high stability of NiFe2O4 NPs (Fig. 1(b)) [66]. The initial rate of H2O2 production with use of NiFe2O4 NPs with diameters of 120 and 91 nm was 22 and 33 times faster, respectively, as compared to that with use of NiFe2O4 NPs with a diameter of 1300 nm (Fig. 1(a)) [66]. Such an increase in catalytic reactivity occurs due to the increase in surface area of the WOC [66]. Heteropolynuclear cyanide metal complexes containing different metals such as Fe3[CoIII(CN)6]2 act as WOCs in the photocatalytic H2O2 production by oxidation of H2O by O2 with a photocatalyst, [RuII(4,7-Me2phen)3]2+, and a Lewis acid, ScIII(NO3)3, under visible-light illumination (λ > 420 nm) in H2O [67]. The catalytic reactivity was improved by changing the Fe-to-Co ratio in the (FeII x CoII 1−x ) moiety of (FeII x CoII 1−x )3[CoIII(CN)6]2 and the maximum catalytic reactivity was obtained with the Fe-to-Co ratio of 0.75 [67]. A larger Fe ratio in the (FeII x CoII 1−x ) moiety would have more active sites for the H2O oxidation catalysis, whereas a smaller Fe ratio would stabilize high-valent metals formed during the catalytic H2O oxidation [67]. Such two opposite effects of Fe in H2O oxidation catalysis was balanced to obtain the best ratio of Fe (x = 0.75) in (FeII x CoII 1−x )3[CoIII(CN)6]2 for the photocatalytic H2O2 production [67]. Polymeric CN-bridged heteronuclear metal complexes, M(II)[Ru(II)(CN)4(bpy)] (M(II) = Ni(II), Fe(II) and Mn(II)), act as bifunctional catalysts for both the 4e−/4H+ H2O oxidation to O2 and the 2e−/2H+ O2 reduction to H2O2 in photocatalytic H2O2 production by oxidation of H2O by O2 [68]. The highest TON (turnover number) of 247 was obtained based on the monomer unit of Ni(II)[Ru(II)(CN)4(bpy)] that was employed as a bifunction photocatalyst for the H2O2 production by oxidation of H2O by O2 in CH3OH/H2O (5:1 v/v) containing ScIII(NO3)3 under illumination (λ > 390 nm) [68]. No H2O2 was produced in pure CH3OH, manifesting that water is the electron source of O2 reduction [68]. The catalytic mechanism of the photocatalytic H2O2 production with Ni(II)[Ru(II)(CN)4(bpy)] is proposed as shown in Scheme 2 [68], where ET from the photoexcited state of Ni(II)[Ru(II)(CN)4(bpy)] to O2 with Sc3+ to produce [Ni(II)[Ru(III)(CN)4(bpy)]]+ and O2 •–-Sc3+ that disproportionates with H+ to produce H2O2 [68]. Four equivalents of the Ru(III) moiety in [Ni(II)[Ru(III)(CN)4(bpy)]]+ oxidize water by the catalysis of the Ni moiety in Ni(II)[Ru(II)(CN)4(bpy)] to evolve O2 [68]. The dual function of M(II)[Ru(II)(CN)4(bpy)] as a single catalyst for the 4e−/4H+ H2O oxidation and the 2e−/2H+ O2 reduction provides an efficient integrated way to produce H2O2 by photocatalytic oxidation of H2O by O2. Hydrogen peroxide production by combining the catalytic 4e−/4H+ H2O oxidation to O2 and the photocatalytic 2e−/2H+ O2 reduction to H2O2 using the same homogeneous solution described above inevitably competed with the further oxidation of H2O2 with a WOC to preclude production of H2O2 that is stable enough to obtain high concentrations (> 10 mM). Hence, the photocatalytic H2O2 production by oxidation of H2O by O2 was performed with use of a two-compartment cell that consists of a semiconductor photocatalyst anode, which was separated by a Nafion membrane from a carbon cloth cathode in the presence of Ru complexes and ScIII(NO3)3 in an O2-saturated aqueous solution to obtain high concentrations of H2O2 in contrast to those with a one-compartment cell [69]. A schematic representation of such a two-compartment cell is shown in Fig. 2 , where WO3 or BiVO4 was employed as a photoanode for the photocatalytic H2O oxidation [70–73] and a carbon mesh cathode was used for the 2e−/2H+ O2 reduction to H2O2 with a Ru complex [69]. The best performance was obtained when [RuII((MeO)2bpy)3]2+ ((MeO)2bpy = 4,4’-dimethoxy-2,2’-bipy- ridine) was used as a photocatalyst for the 2e−/2H+ O2 reduction in an O2-saturated H2O containing ScIII(NO3)3 (0.10 M) employing the carbon mesh cathode and the BiVO4 photoanode for the photocatalytic H2O2 production by the H2O oxidation by O2 [69]. The mechanism of visible-light-driven H2O2 production by the catalytic H2O oxidation by O2 in the two-compartment cell is shown in Scheme 3 [69], where ET from photoexcited state of Ru(II) complex ([RuII((MeO)2bpy)3]2+*) to O2 with Sc3+ occurs to produce Ru(III) complex and O2 •–-Sc3+ species [62–64] that disproportionates with H+ to produce H2O2 in competition of back ET from O2 •–-Sc3+ species to Ru(III) complex [50]. The photoexcitation of BiVO4 results in generation of holes and electrons, which oxidize H2O to O2 and reduce Ru(III) to Ru(II), respectively [69]. The solar energy conversion efficiency in the solar-light-driven H2O2 production by oxidation of H2O by O2 using a two-compartment cell was much improved by employing monoclinic bismuth vanadate (BiVO4), which was modified with metal oxide(hydroxide) (M=O(OH), M = Fe, Ni) as a photoanode [74–76] and a cobalt chlorin complex adsorbed on carbon paper (CoII(Ch)/CP) as an efficient and selective catalyst for the 2e−/2H+ reduction of O2 [77,78] (Scheme 4 ) [79]. The best solar-to-H2O2 energy conversion efficiency was obtained as 6.6% and 0.89% under 0.05 sun and 1 sun irradiation, respectively [79]. These values are much larger than that of swichgrass (0.2%), which has been considered more recently as a biomass crop for ethanol and butanol (i.e., biomass fuel) [80]. Due to the global shortage of clean fresh water around the world, it is highly desirable to use seawater instead of pure water for solar-light-driven H2O2 production as a solar fuel, because seawater is the earth's richest water source. More efficient solar-light-driven production of H2O2 by the H2O oxidation by O2 was made possible by using seawater rather than pure water and O2 in the air with use of a two-compartment cell composed of m-WO3/FTO photoanode and CoII(Ch)/CP cathode [81]. The rate of photocatalytic H2O2 production in seawater was markedly enhanced as compared with that in pure water. After 24 h simulated solar-light irradiation, the concentration of H2O2 produced in seawater increased up to 48 mM, which could be directly used to operate an H2O2 fuel cell [81]. The virtually the same enhancement of solar-light-driven H2O2 production was observed using an NaCl solution, in which the concentration of Cl− was the same as that in the seawater [81]. The oxidation of Cl− rather than H2O by photogenerated hole upon photoexcitation of WO3 occurred to produce chlorine (Cl2), which was converted to HClO depending on the pH of the solution [82]. HClO decomposed to produce O2 and Cl− under simulated solar-light irradiation [83]. Thus, the solar-light-driven water oxidation is accelerated by Cl− [81]. The solar energy conversion efficiency for the solar-light-driven H2O2 production in seawater was determined to be 0.55% under simulated 1 sun illumination [81]. TiO2 was reported to photocatalyze the production of H2O2 by Au NP loading to yield H2O2 on a 10 mM level [84]. Au/TiO2 exhibited an efficient photocatalytic activity to attain the quantum yield (Ф = molecules produced/incident photons) of 13% at the light wavelength (λ = 355 λ 23 nm) [84]. However, 4% ethanol was necessary as a hole-scavenger for the photodriven production of H2O2 to proceed [84]. Aliphatic alcohols are frequently used as hole-scavengers for the photocatalytic H2O2 production by the 2e−/2H+ O2 reduction [85–88]. Graphitic carbon nitride (GCN), a metal-free polymeric semiconductor with a graphitic stacking structure of melem sheets also promotes selective 2e−/2H+ O2 reduction with ethanol to produce H2O2 [89–91]. However, the g-C3N4 catalyst is not capable of photocatalyzing H2O2 production by the water oxidation by O2 [92], because the top of the valence band (VB) lies at approximately 1.4 V vs. NHE (normal hydrogen electrode) at pH 7 [93], which is insufficient for water oxidation (ca. 0.8 V) [94,95]. Incorporating aromatic diimides into graphitic carbon nitrides (g-C3N4) results in positive shifts of the oxidation and reduction potentials due to their high electron affinity [96]. Thus, incorporation of an electron deficient pyromellitic diimide (PDI) unit into the g-C3N4 network by thermal condensation (Scheme 5(a) ) made it possible to act as a photocatalyst for H2O2 production by H2O oxidation by O2 without hole scavenger [97,98]. The g-C3N4/PDI catalyst contains an electronic band structure capable of oxidizing H2O and reducing O2 as well [97,98]. Photoexcitation of the g-C3N4/PDI catalyst at λ < 470 nm (A in Scheme 5(c)) results in formation of hole (h+) and electron (e−) pairs at 2,6- and 1,4-positions on the melem unit, respectively (B in Scheme 5(c)). The hole oxidizes H2O, whereas the electron reduces O2 to produce a superoxo radical (C in Scheme 5(c)). Rapid reduction of the radical by another e− at the para position produces 1,4-endoperoxide species (D in Scheme 5(c)), which is readily transformed to H2O2 by the reaction with H+ (Scheme 5(c)) [97,98]. The efficient formation of the endoperoxide species suppresses the e−/H+ or 4e−/4H+ O2 reduction, facilitating selective 2e−/2H+ O2 reduction to produce H2O2 [98]. Moreover, no decomposition of H2O2 occurred in the presence of g-C3N4/PDI [98]. However, the amount of H2O2 produced after 48 h photoillumination was 30 μmol when the solar energy conversion efficiency was only 0.1% under simulated 1 sun irradiation, which should be much improved [97]. The solar energy conversion efficiency of photocatalytic H2O2 production with g-C3N4/PDI was improved by hybridizing g-C3N4/PDI with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) by simple hydrothermal-calcination sequence to attain 0.20% under simulated 1 sun illumination [98]. Strong interaction between g-C3N4/PDI and rGO promotes photoinduced charge separation of h+ and e− [98]. The rGO acts as a trapping site for conduction band electron of the photoexcited g-C3N4/PDI moiety as well as an active site promoting selective 2e−/2H+ O2 reduction, thus promoting efficient H2O2 production under simulated solar-light illumination [98]. Charge transfer (CT) interaction between electron donor (D) and electron acceptor (A) units of copolymers results in formation of D-A couples with low HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) gaps. The energy level hybridization by π-conjugation along the polymer chain and π-stacking between the chains forms a lower band-gap semiconductors with high conductivity to achieve efficient charge separation. High temperature and high pressure hydrothermal conditions were used to synthesize methylene-cross linked resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) resins composed of a large number of quinoid forms of resorcinol acting as A, which are π-conjugated with inherent benzenoid forms of resorcinol as D [99]. The π-stacking of the benzenoid-quinoid D-A pairs leads to hybridization of the HOMO-LUMO levels, resulting in formation of semiconductors with low band-gaps. RF resins act as highly active D-A polymer photocatalysts to promote H2O2 production by oxidation of H2O by O2 using visible-light up to 700 nm [99]. Simulated solar-light illumination (1 sun) of the RF resin with O2 in H2O at barometric pressure produced H2O2 with the solar energy conversion efficiency of 0.5% [99]. In nature, water is oxidized in the photosystem II (PSII) to extract four electrons and four protons from two molecules of water, reducing the plastoquinone (PQ) in the quinone pool to produce plastoquinol (PQH2) [100,101]. The overall solar-light-driven 4e−/4H+ H2O oxidation, accompanied by reduction of PQ, is given by Eq. (1), where PQ is reduced by H2O to produce O2 and PQH2 [100,101]. (1) 2H2O + 2PQ → O2 + 2PQH2 Photodriven 4e−/4H+ H2O oxidation of by p-benzoquinone derivatives (X-Q), which is a potential functional mimic of PSII, was made possible by using a nonheme iron(II) complex, [(N4Py)FeII]2+ (N4Py = N,N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)-N-bis- (2-pyridyl)methylamine) as a WOC [Eq. (2)] [102]. Photoirradiation of an MeCN solution containing 2,3-dichloro- 5,6-dicyano-p-benzoquinone (DDQ), [(N4Py)FeII]2+ and H2O using a Xe lamp resulted in O2 evolution with nearly 100% yield on the basis of the initial concentration of DDQ, while DDQ was reduced by H2O to produce DDQH2 [102]. The yield of O2 evolution was reduced due to the oxidation of DDQH2 by O2 to produce H2O2 with the regeneration of DDQ in long light irradiation time [Eq. (3)] [102]. Other p-benzoquinone derivatives, such as p-benzoquinone, p-chloranil, toluquinone and duroquionone, with [(N4Py)FeII]2+ can also oxidize water to evolve O2 under photoillumination [102]. (2) 2H2O + 2X-Q → O2 + 2PQH2 (3) DDQH2 + O2 → DDQ + H2O2 The catalytic mechanism of the photodriven H2O oxidation by X-Q with [(N4Py)FeII]2+ to evolve O2 is shown in Scheme 6 , where DDQ is employed as an oxidant [102]. Photoexcitation of DDQ results in formation of the triplet excited state (3DDQ*) via intersystem crossing from the singlet excited state (1DDQ*) [103,104]. Fe(II) species is oxidized by 3DDQ* via ET to produce Fe(III) and DDQ•– species. The rate constant was determined by laser-induced transient absorption measurements to be 1.0 × 1010 M−1 s−1, which is close to the diffusion-limited rate constant at 298 K. Fe(III) species produced by the photoinduced ET reacts with H2O to generate the iron(III)-hydroxo (FeIII-OH) complex and H+, whereas DDQ•– is protonated to form DDQH• (pathway a in Scheme 6). Iron(III)-hydroxo complex is further oxidized by 3DDQ* via ET to generate the iron(IV)-oxo [FeIV(O)] complex and DDQH• (pathway b in Scheme 6) [102]. The formation of iron(IV)-oxo was detected by the laser-induced transient absorption measurements (λ max = 690 nm) [102]. Then, ET from FeIV(O) to 3DDQ* occurs to generate the iron(V)-oxo [FeV(O)] complex and DDQ•–. The rate constant of the photoinduced ET was determined to be 9.4 × 109 M−1 s−1, which is also close to the diffusion-limited rate constant at 298 K (pathway c in Scheme 6) [102]. A nucleophilic attack of H2O to FeV(O) generates the iron(III)-hydroperoxo [FeIII(OOH)] complex and H+ (pathway d in Scheme 6) [102]. Iron(III)-hydroperoxo species is oxidized thermally by DDQ to produce the iron(III)-superoxo [FeIII(O2 •–)] complex and DDQH• species (pathway e in Scheme 6), followed by O2 release to regenerate iron(II) complex (pathway f in Scheme 6) [102]. It was confirmed that iron(III)-hydroperoxo was oxidized by DDQ thermally to evolve O2, when iron(III)-hydroperoxo complex was independently prepared by the oxidation of iron(II) complex by H2O2 [102]. DDQ can be replaced by other p-benzoquinone derivatives (X-Q) to achieve photocatalytic oxidation of H2O by X-Q with iron(II) complex to evolve O2 [102]. The combination of the photocatalytic 4e−/4H+ H2O oxidation by X-Q with iron(II) complex (i.e., [(N4Py)FeII]2+) and 2e−/2H+ O2 reduction by X-QH2 would enhance the production of H2O2 by oxidation of H2O by O2."
2,2e−/2H+ Oxidation of H2O,"In addition to the 4e−/4H+ H2O oxidation to evolve O2 (the reverse reaction of the 4e−/4H+ O2 reduction), the 2e−/2H+ H2O oxidation affords H2O2 [Eq. (4)] [105,106]. The combination of the 2e−/2H+ H2O oxidation with the 2e− reduction of 2H+ [Eq. (5)] results in water splitting to produce H2O2 and H2 [Eq. (6)] [106]. (4) 2H2O – 2e− → H2O2 + 2H+ E 1/2 = 1.77 V vs. RHE (5) 2H+ + 2e− → H2 (6) 2H2O → H2O2 + H2 The photoelectrochemical water splitting to H2O2 and H2 has been achieved with use of a WO3/BiVO4 photoanode [107–109] under simulated solar-light illumination by applying potential much lower than that applied to the electrode in electrolysis (ca. > 0.4 V) (Fig. 3 ) [110]. H2O2 was produced only in the presence of KHCO3 in H2O and the maximum selectivity (η(H2O2)) for H2O2 production reached 54% in the presence of a high concentration (2.0 M) of HCO3 − in H2O at 5 °C, and the H2O2 concentration produced was 2.0 mM [110]. When KHCO3 was replaced by other electrolytes, H2O2 was hardly produced [110]. Although the role of KHCO3 for the photoelectrocatalytic production of H2O2 has yet to be well clarified, HCO3 − oxidation in the holes of BiVO4 may produce HCO4 − and C2O6 2–, which act as an effective catalyst for the 2e−/2H+ H2O oxidation [107]. The Faraday efficiency of photoelectrocatalytic production of H2O2 and O2 reached 100% in the anode reaction, indicating that the oxidized products of H2O were only H2O2 and O2 [110]. The maximum η(H2O2) value was improved to 73% by using an Sb-modified anode containing mixed metal oxides such as CuSbO x /FTO and InSbO x /FTO [111]. The TON based on the number of loaded metal oxides exceeded 82,000 [111]. The H2 gas was evolved as a reductive product of protons in Eq. (2) on the Pt cathode with 100% Faraday efficiency [110]. Bi2WO6 is also used as a suitable electrode for H2O2 production by 2e−/2H+ oxidation of H2O. The rate of H2O2 production was optimized by Mo-doping and enlarged specific surface area [110]. The FTO/Bi2WO6:Mo electrode afforded the maximum Faraday efficiency of 79% at 3.2 V (vs. RHE), exhibiting good durability at least for 6 h electrolysis [110]. Combination of a WO3/BiVO4 photoanode with a HCO3 − electrolyte for the 2e−/2H+ oxidation of H2O and an Au cathode for the 2e−/2H+ reduction of O2 resulted in solar-light-driven production of H2O2 (η anode(H2O2) ≈ 50% and η cathode(H2O2) ≈ 90 %) without applied potential between the photoanode and cathode under simulated solar-light illumination when an Au-supported porous BiVO4 sheet (Fig. 4 ) was employed as a photocatalyst [111]. A composite electrode (WO3/BiVO4+Au), which was supported by both porous WO3/BiVO4 and Au on a single FTO substrate, was prepared to achieve simultaneous H2O2 production by the 2e−/2H+ H2O oxidation combined with the 2e−/2H+ O2 reduction on a single photoelectrode substrate (photocatalyst sheet) without separating anode and cathode solutions under simulated solar-light illumination (Fig. 5(A) – (C)) [111]. The WO3/BiVO4 electrode was obtained by a two-step process using the same procedure on half of an FTO substrate and the Au sheet was prepared by the same sputtering method on another half of an FTO substrate (Fig. 5(A) and 5(B)) [111]. H2O2 was produced under photoirradiation even on this composite electrode containing WO3/BiVO4 and Au on a single FTO substrate in an aqueous solution containing KHCO3 (2.0 M). The concentration of H2O2 reached approximately 130 μM after 60 min light photoirradiation [111]. The realization of H2O2 production by using WO3/BiVO4 with an Au electrode under solar-light illumination suggests that an ultimate simple system is made possible by oxidative and reductive H2O2 generation by using BiVO4 photocatalyst powder with Au particles as a cocatalyst (Fig. 5(D) ) [111]. In fact, H2O2 (ca. 220 μM for 60 min) was produced by using Au-supported BiVO4 photocatalyst powder suspended in H2O containing KHCO3 (2.0 M) under simulated solar-light illumination [111]. A BiVO4/WO3 photoelectrode was modified with Al2O3 by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method and solar-light-driven production of H2O2 in H2O containing KHCO3 (2.0 M) was achieved by using the Al2O3/BiVO4/WO3 photoelectrode and a biomass-derived carbon cathode without applying any external bias potential to obtain Faraday efficiencies of 44% for the cathode and 60% for photoelectrode [112]."
3,Hydrogen peroxide fuel cells,"Hydrogen peroxide obtained by the photocatalytic oxidation of water or seawater by O2 (vide supra) was used as a fuel in a one-compartment H2O2 fuel cell composed of a Prussian blue-structured polynuclear cyanide complex (FeII 3[CoIII(CN)6]2) adsorbed on a carbon cloth (CP) cathode and a nickel mesh anode [17–20,113]. Such a membraneless one-compartment H2O2 fuel cell utilizes H2O2 for both oxidant and reductant to achieve a theoretical output potential of 1.09 V (Scheme 7 ), which is only slightly lower but comparable to that can be obtained from a hydrogen fuel cell (1.23 V) [15]. The reaction solution (pH 1.3) containing H2O2 (52 mM) in the CoII(Ch)/CP cathode produced after photocatalytic 4e−/4H+ H2O oxidation with the FeO(OH)/BiVO4/FTO photoanode and the 2e−/2H+ O2 reduction with CoII(Ch)/CP cathode (Scheme 4) was transferred to an H2O2 fuel cell, which exhibited an open circuit potential and a maximum power density of 0.79 V and 2.0 mW cm−2, respectively (Fig. 6 ) [79]. The conversion of chemical energy to electric energy using H2O2 as a solar fuel was achieved to obtain the solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency of the total system as 3.3%, because the energy conversion efficiency of the H2O2 fuel cell was ~50% [79]. It is desired to replace a Ni anode used for one-compartment H2O2 fuel cells because Ni is vulnerable to H2O2. An anodic catalyst composed of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and vitamin B12 (CNT/VitB12) was reported to promote the H2O2 oxidation, improving the cell performance of a membraneless H2O2 fuel cell [114]. The open circuit voltage (OCV) and maximum power density of the 100 mM H2O2 fuel were determined to be 0.233 λ 0.005 V and 53.8 λ 0.4 μW cm−2, respectively [114]. A metal-free conducting polymer, poly(3,4- ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT), was utilized as a cathodic catalyst for the 2e−/2H+ H2O2 reduction to H2O with a Ni anode to obtain open circuit potentials in the range of 0.5 to 0.6 V with power densities in the range of 0.20 to 0.30 mW cm−2 [115]. The H2O2 fuel cell performance would be improved by optimizing PEDOT formulations or by switching to other next generation conductive polymers capable of developing anodic catalysts that facilitate H2O2 oxidation, leading to a complete metal-free membraneless one-compartment H2O2 fuel cell [115]. A membraneless microfluidic fuel cell (MMFC) with a single stream in the cotton threads is shown in Fig. 7 , where a capillary coupled with gravity forces is used to move the reactant solution transport through the cotton threads without any external pump [13]. The MMFC consists of a cover plate, Ni mesh adopted as an anode to catalyze H2O2 oxidation, and Prussian blue (PB)-coated CP employed as a cathode to catalyze H2O2 reduction [13]. The cover and supporting plates composed of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) are used to fix and support electrodes, respectively. Thirty cotton threads are placed in parallel on the electrodes to form a flow channel for the reactant. In this MMFC, fuel crossover or diffusion mixing between fuel and oxidant can be avoided [13]. The MMFC generated an open circuit potential of 0.66 V with a maximum power density of 5.5 mW cm−2, which are larger than those of other H2O2 MMFCs reported previously [116–121]. The MMFC was applied to develop a self-powered H2O2 electrochemical sensor on the basis of the proposed fuel cell structure [13]."
4,Oxidation of organic substrates with photogenerated H2O2,"Hydrogen peroxide has been widely used for selective oxidation of organic substrates with oxidation catalysts [7–14]. The rational development of a series of oxidation catalysts for direct C–H or C–C bond activation with H2O2 has now reached maturity for use in selective late-stage functionalization of organic compounds [122–128]. Because H2O2 can be produced from H2O as a reductant and O2 as an oxidant (vide supra), combination of photodriven production of H2O2 by oxidation of H2O by O2 with the thermal oxidation of organic substrates by H2O2 with a catalyst provides a cost effective method for selective photodriven oxidation of organic substrates using only H2O and O2 as an oxygen source and an oxidant, respectively. Photocatalytic production of H2O2 by oxidation of H2O by O2 with [RuII(4,7-Me2phen)3]2+ as a photocatalyst and [(Cp*)CoIII(bpy)(H2O)]2+ as a water oxidation catalyst was combined with the catalytic hydroxylation of benzene with H2O2 using [(Cp*)CoIII(bpy)(H2O)]2+ that acts not only as a WOC but also as a benzene hydroxylation catalyst to yield phenol with TON > 500 (Scheme 8 ) [129]. This TON is much larger than those reported for photocatalytic hydroxylation of benzene with O2 using organic photocatalysts [130–132]. Photoexcitation of Ru(II) complex resulted in formation of Ru2+* and ET from Ru2+* to O2 in the presence of ScIII(NO3)3 to produce Ru(III) complex and O2 •–-Sc3+ species that disproportionates to produce H2O2 and O2 in the presence of H+ (Scheme 8, pathways (b) and (c)) [129]. Ru(III) complex is used as an oxidant to oxidize water with [(Cp*)CoIII(bpy)(H2O)]2+ (Scheme 8, pathway (a)). Phenol Production by benzene hydroxylation has also been achieved by combination of the catalytic benzene hydroxylation with H2O2 and photocatalytic H2O2 production by oxidation of H2O by O2 with use of a CN-bridged polynuclear Fe(II)-Ru(II) complex (FeII 2[RuII(CN)6]), incorporated into mesoporous silica-alumina (sAl-MCM-41), FeII 2[RuII(CN)6]@sAl-MCM-41, acting as a triple functional catalyst for benzene hydroxylation catalyst, WOC and a photocatalyst for the 2e−/2H+ O2 reduction to H2O2 [133]. The catalytic durability was significantly improved by the incorporation of FeII 2[RuII(CN)6] into sAl-MCM-41. Remarkably, the selectivity of product to phenol was higher than 99%, indicating that no over-oxidation products, such as p-benzoquinone, were produced [133]. The TON of the formation of phenol reached 2500 at 114 h photoirradiation [133]. The proposed catalytic mechanism of photodriven benzene hydroxylation by O2 with FeII 2[RuII(CN)6]@sAl-MCM-41 in MeCN containing H2O is shown in Scheme 9 [133]. Photoexcitation of FeII 2[RuII(CN)6] resulted in ET from FeII 2[RuII(CN)6]* to O2 with Sc3+ to form FeII 2[RuIII(CN)6]+ complex and O2 •–-Sc3+ species that disproportionates with H+ to produce H2O2 and O2 [50]. FeII 2[RuIII(CN)6]+, which exhibits high oxidizing ability (E 1/2 = 1.24 V vs. SHE) [133], can produce phenol by oxidizing the Fe(II) moiety to a high-valent iron species effective in both oxidation of water and hydroxylation of benzene with H2O2 [133]. The catalytic oxidation of organic substrates with H2O2 combined with the photocatalytic H2O2 production by oxidation of H2O by O2 provides a new strategy to achieve one-pot oxygenation of substrates using O2 as the greenest oxidant and H2O as the most environmentally benign oxygen source. An unbiased photoelectrochemical (PEC) tandem cell composed of a FeOOH/BiVO4 photoanode, a Cu(In, Ga)Se2 solar absorber, and a graphitic carbon nitride/reduced graphene oxide hybrid cathode (Fig. 8 ) was developed to achieve photocatalytic stereoselective ethylbenzene hydroxylation to obtain (R)-1-phenylethanol with TONs larger than 4.3 × 104, a TOF (turnover frequency) of 12.9 s−1 and high enantioselectivity (ee > 99%) [134]. A sufficient photovoltage is generated by the solar absorber, producing H2O2 in situ by 2e−/2H+ reduction of O2 combined with 2e−/2H+ oxidation of H2O in the absence of external bias. As a counter electrode in the PEC tandem cell, graphitic carbon nitride (CN) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hybrid film was used as an effective cathode material for the 2e−/2H+ reduction of O2 using electrons extracted from water oxidation at the BiVO4 photoanode [132]. In order to increase the electrochemical active surface area, rGO was used as a supporting layer for CN [135]. The recombinant peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita (AaeUPO) catalyzed selectively the ethylbenzene hydroxylation with H2O2 to yield (R)-1-phenylethanol [134]. Thus, integration of unbiased PEC system with peroxygenases has been demonstrated to promote C-H oxyfunctionalization using solar-powered electrons extracted from H2O."
5,Conclusion and perspective,"Combination of 2e−/2H+ reduction of O2 with photodriven 4e−/4H+ oxidation of H2O resulted in photocatalytic H2O2 production by oxidation of H2O by O2. A homogeneous photocatalytic system for photodriven production of H2O2 by oxidation of H2O by O2 is composed of a Ru(II) complex acting as a photoredox catalyst for 2e−/2H+ O2 reduction to produce H2O2 and a Co(III) complex acting as a redox catalyst for 4e−/4H+ H2O oxidation to evolve O2. Heterogeneous photocatalysts for water oxidation can also be used to be combined with a Co(III) chlorin complex for 2e−/2H+ O2 reduction to achieve photodriven production of H2O2 by oxidation of H2O by O2. Both 2e−/2H+ H2O oxidation and 2e−/2H+ O2 reduction yield H2O2 simultaneously. Thus, simultaneous H2O2 production by the 2e−/2H+ H2O oxidation and the 2e−/2H+ O2 reduction has been achieved using a single photocatalyst sheet without separation of anode and cathode solutions under simulated solar-light illumination. H2O2 produced by photodriven H2O oxidation by O2 is used as a fuel in H2O2 fuel cells to obtain electricity. Solar-light-driven production of H2O2 by H2O oxidation by O2 is also combined with green oxidation of organic substrates with H2O2 when O2 is used as the greenest oxidant and H2O as the most environmentally benign oxygen source. The best solar-to-H2O2 energy conversion efficiency has so far been limited to 6.6% and 0.89% under 0.05 sun and 1 sun, respectively [79]. The further improvement of the efficiency of solar-light-driven production of H2O2 will be made by the combination of 2e−/2H+ H2O oxidation and 2e−/2H+ O2 reduction, facilitating the use of H2O2 as a solar fuel in fuel cells as well as a green oxidant."
