0,Introduction,"Lead acid battery (LAB) has been a reliable energy storage device for more than 150years since Plante invented LAB in 1859 [1–3]. Due to its characteristics of safety, reliable performance and mature manufacture, lead acid battery has been applied in various applications, such as start, light and ignition (SLI) batteries for automobiles [4], uninterruptable power supply (UPS) [5], electric vehicles (especially for electric bicycles and tricycles) [6] and the storage of electricity generated by renewable energies or pulse power source in hybrid electrical vehicles [7,8]. The applications of LAB can be classified into four user modes: (i) Infrequent discharge for UPS, in which condition, LAB is under fully charged condition at most time of its service life; (ii) Frequent, shallow depth of discharge for SLI applications; (iii) Deep charge-discharge duty in electric vehicles; (iv) The forth situations, probably the most rapid-developing application of LAB in 21st century, are the applications of LAB under partial state of charge (PSoC) duty, such as battery module in hybrid electric vehicles and the grid-scale energy storage of electricity generated by renewable energy. For grid-scale energy storage, LABs works as an electrical load when renewable energy generates extra energy. When the requirement of load can't be satisfied by renewable energy, LABs release power. In this case, LABs in renewable energy storage undergoes insufficient charge, which is also called PSoC conditions [9,10]. In PSoC duty, the negative active materials (NAM) of LAB faces sulfation, namely, the electrochemically active PbSO4 with small particle size grows into non-electrochemically active PbSO4 with large particle size which can be hardly charged into its active state of sponge Pb [11]. The sulfation of negative electrode is one of the main problems that shortens the cycle life of LAB, resulting in high electricity storage cost of renewable energy storage. It's of great necessity to enhance the service life of the negative electrode in LAB under PSoC operation. Sulfation of negative electrode can be solved by inhibiting the growth of PbSO4 particles. The addition of carbon materials into the NAM could reduce the sulfation problem [12–20]. Although, carbon materials greatly enhances the electrical double layer capacitance and the conductivity of negative plates at PSoC condition, the effect of carbon materials on the electrochemical process is thought mainly due to altering of the active surface which serves as nucleation sites for the deposition of Pb in negative electrode [15,16]. This role of carbon materials is just like the role of BaSO4, which reduces the particle size of PbSO4 by severing as nucleation sites for the growth of PbSO4. Despite of the positive effect of carbon materials, the production of lead-carbon composite electrode is somewhat technically difficult due to the change of the density of leady-oxide-based pastes, the lowered over-potential of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the instability of lead-carbon composite electrode and also the higher self-discharge rate [21]. Another way to reduce the sulfation of negative electrode is to explore sulfation inhibitor in the electrolyte of LAB. The addition of sulfation inhibitor in the electrolyte is a facile method which can be adopted in industrial production easily [22–28]. Wang et al. designed a kind of polysiloxane-based gel electrolyte for LAB, the polysiloxane-based gel electrode possesses higher HER over-potential than traditional silica gel electrolyte [22]. Hence, the LAB based on the polysiloxane-based gel electrolyte exhibits higher capacity. Based on this case, the formation of gel electrolyte is very important for the PSoC operation of LAB [23]. Polyaspartic acid (PASP) seems to be an effective additive in the sulfuric electrolyte, especially in gel-based-electrolyte for LAB working under PSoC duty [24–26]. In 2006, Pavlov et al. reported that PASP controls the crystallization process of PbSO4 and modifies the shape and size of PbSO4 crystals [24]. In 2012, Pavlov further demonstrated the superior performance of PASP in electrolyte for a lead-carbon composite electrode [25]. In 2016, Tantavichet et al. discovered that the addition of 0.005 (w/v)% PASP in the gelled electrolyte could greatly enhance the performance of LAB in both 100% depth of discharge (DoD) and PSoC duty [26]. Notably, some other materials may be also suitable for both liquid electrolyte and gel-electrolyte. Deyab found the positive effect of l‑serine on increasing the HER overpotential of negative electrode [27]. The electrolyte additives mentioned above reduce the particle size of PbSO4 [28]. Subsequently, the electrochemically active PbSO4 reduces polarization, which leads to low HER rate of negative electrodes and cyclic stability of LABs [16]. Since both organic additives and carbon materials [29–31] can be added to alter the electrochemical performance of negative electrode in LAB. In this paper, polyvinyl alcohol/nano-carbon colloid (PCC) was prepared through simple dissolution process. Experiment results demonstrate that PCC exhibits positive effect on suppressing the growth of PbSO4 and improving the cyclic stability of LAB under insufficient charge condition. This paper proposes a new way for enhancing the performance of lead acid battery without changing the structure and design of LAB."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of polyvinyl alcohol/nano-carbon colloid (PCC),"2.1 Preparation of polyvinyl alcohol/nano-carbon colloid (PCC) To synthesize the polyvinyl alcohol/nano-carbon colloid (PCC) additives, first, a kind of water-soluble polymer, polyvinyl alcohol (20g), was dissolved in water (500mL) at a fixed temperature of 95°C with a stir stirring for 2h, and then a kind of nano-sized carbon material, acetylene black (1g), was added in the solution slowly with the help of ultrasonic treatment for another 2h. PCC was collected and preserved for use. As shown in Fig. 1 , the nano-carbon precipitated in the water (Fig. 1), while, PCC has good stability in water (Fig. 1b). The concentration of PCC in sulfuric acid electrolyte (s.g. 1.24gcm−3) for container formation or electrochemical test was 2 v%, which is shown in Fig. 1c. The PCC added in sulfuric electrolyte also shows good stability."
3,Battery assembly and test,"2.2 Battery assembly and test A 2V battery with commercial negative plates and positive plates (obtained from Meineng group, Zhejiang province, China) was assembled. The unit 2V battery was composed of 7 positive plates and 8 negative plates. Each plate has a geometric area of ca. 7cm×4cm. H2SO4 solution with specific gravity of 1.24gcm−3 was used as electrolyte in container formation process. The nominal 2-h capacity (C2) of the assembled battery was 12Ah. The charge-discharge test of LAB was carried on a battery tester (CT2001B, LANHE, China). The formation process was carried out in a standard industrial formation process, which was applied in our previous study [29]. After formation, the battery goes capacity test with a constant charge current of 0.2C2 to 2.45V and a constant charge voltage of 2.45V for 6h, the discharge current is 0.5C2 with a cut-off voltage of 1.8V. The test of insufficient charge of lead acid battery was shown in Fig. 2 . After fully charged, the battery goes discharge and last for 120h (5days) at discharged state, then the battery goes three charge-discharge cycles, repeat the above process for 4 times."
4,Physical and electrochemical characterization,"2.3 Physical and electrochemical characterization The morphologies of the negative plates were observed with a field emission scan electron microscope (SEM) (SU8020, Hitachi, Japan). For three-electrode electrochemical investigations, a pure lead electrode with geometric area of 2cm×2cm was applied. H2SO4 with specific gravity of 1.28 was used as electrolyte. The pretreatment of lead electrode was described in our previous work [16]. Cyclic voltammetry, steady polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were tested on an electrochemical work station (Parstat 2273, Ametek, USA). Steady polarization was test with chronoamperometry method and the current response was collected after 1200s when a certain potential was set. The EIS results were simulated via Zsimpwin software. In the three electrode measurement, all the potentials were quoted with respect to a mercurous sulfate electrode (MSE) (Hg/Hg2SO4/K2SO4 (saturated), 0.65V vs. SHE)."
5,Results and discussions,"To demonstrate the positive effects of PCC towards lead acid battery, two parallel experiments (PCC1 and PCC2) were carried out. As shown in Fig. 3a, LAB with PCC added in the electrolyte has a relatively smaller capacity than the control battery at initial 10cycles. However, higher capacity of LAB with PCC was observed from 18 to 24cycles. The coulombic efficiency of LAB usually is higher than 90% due to the high HER overpotential on Pb electrode and high oxygen evolution overpotential on PbO2 electrode. The coulombic efficiency of the control battery and LAB with PCC was displayed in Fig. 3b. Owing to the addition of PCC in the electrolyte in LAB, the LAB with PCC has a much higher coulombic efficiency than the control battery, which can be seen from the 10th (Fig. 3c) and 24th (Fig. 3d) charge-discharge curves. As shown in Fig. 4a, the capacity of the control battery is relatively lower than the LAB with PCC within the 12cycles under insufficient charge condition. Great difference has been seen in the coulombic efficiency (Fig. 4b), the LAB with PCC has a much higher coulombic efficiency than the control battery. The control battery only has a coulombic efficiency of 83.65% after exposed at discharged condition for 120h. With the accumulation of time at discharged condition for 480h, the control battery only has a coulombic efficiency of 79.81%, much lower than LAB with PCC (90%–95%). This result is due to the lowered charge acceptance of lead negative electrode, since sulfation of negative electrode occurs when LAB was exposed at discharged condition for long time [9]. The subsequent reaction is the HER reaction on Pb negative electrode, which decreases the coulombic efficiency. Although the coulombic efficiency of LAB with PCC lowers after 120h exposed at discharged condition, the coulombic efficiency of LAB with PCC was much higher than the control battery. Within 12 charge-discharge cycles, LAB with PCC always has a coulombic efficiency above 90%. The above results demonstrated that, PCC can improve the charge acceptance of negative electrode under insufficient charge conditions. The charge-discharge curves of LAB with PCC and control battery (Fig. 4c) reveals the much better charge acceptance of LAB with PCC than the control battery. Current-time curve at the constant voltage charge process reveals that the hydrogen evolution rate of LAB with PCC was lower than the control battery (Fig. 4d). Namely, the side-reaction of HER was lowered by adding PCC in electrolyte, which is the reason for the enhanced charge acceptance of LAB with PCC additive. Large PbSO4 particle size will make Pb electrode less electrochemically active, hence the HER on the sulfated negative electrode will be more preferential than the non-sulfated one. The preferential HER on sulfated lead negative electrode is the reason for the lowered coulombic efficiency. The sulfation of negative electrode will thus result in the subsequent loss of water and the failure of LAB to store electricity. SEM was used to observe the PbSO4 accumulated on the surface of the negative plates of LAB, as can be seen, the LAB with PCC in electrolytes has smaller PbSO4 particle size (Fig. 5a) accumulated on the surface of negative plates of LAB than the control battery (Fig. 5b). The PCC used in electrolyte reduces the particle size of PbSO4 effectively. Eelectrochemical experiments were carried out to study the influence of PCC on the electrochemical behavior of Pb electrode. Cyclic voltammograms from −1.4V to −0.7V (Fig. 6a) were carried out to study the electrochemical behavior of Pb in 5M H2SO4, the oxidation peak tends to increase due to the activation of surface. After the activation of Pb surface, the oxidation peak tends to be steady. The nano-carbon materials in the colloids do not show clear effect on the reversibility of Pb/PbSO4 redox couple, probably because of the unabsorbed state of nano-carbon materials in the electrochemical test cell. However, in a compressed LAB, especially a valve-regulated LAB, the nano-carbon materials absorbs on the surface of negative plate, because the internal oxygen combination reaction pushes the nano-carbon onto the surface of Pb plates. Nano-carbon on the surface of negative plates thus can work as the electrochemical active sites for the deposition of Pb in the charge process [32]. The hydrogen evolution behavior has been greatly influenced by the addition of PCC in electrolyte. The Pb electrode has a higher overpotential of HER, which is caused by the polyvinyl alcohol in PCC. The HER rate has been lowered by the addition of PCC which can be seen from the lower current response after the addition of PCC in electrolyte. Steady polarization (Fig. 6b) also demonstrated the lowered HER rate after the addition of PCC in electrolyte. The lowered HER rate of Pb electrode with PCC added in the electrolyte will endow LAB a high charge acceptance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Fig. 7 ) was used to study the electrode/electrolyte interface of Pb/H2SO4 system. The as prepared Pb electrode was polarized at −1.2V for 20min to eliminate the oxides on the surface of Pb. The EIS was measured at −1.0V, −1.1V and −1.2V respectively. Clear tendency can be observed that the impedance of Pb electrode with PCC in electrolyte was much higher than the Pb without PCC in electrolyte. The Nyquist plot shows a charge-transfer dominated behavior. Hence a classical R(QR) equivalent circuit was used to simulate the electrical behavior. In the equivalent circuit, Rs stands for the ohm resistance, Qdl represents the non-ideal electrical double layer capacitor behavior and Rct is the charge transfer resistance of HER on Pb electrode. The simulated results of the electrical elements are listed in Table 1 . As shown in Table 1, the clear tendency was seen that the Rct of Pb with PCC in electrolyte was much higher than Pb electrode without PCC. As an example, at −1.0V the charge transfer resistance of Pb with PCC is 219.2Ω, which is higher than Pb without PCC in electrolyte (169.3Ω). At −1.2V, the charge transfer resistance of Pb with PCC is 25.76Ω, which is higher than Pb without PCC in electrolyte (19.22Ω). The increased charge transfer resistance of Pb electrode with PCC in electrolyte demonstrated the HER inhibitor effect of PCC on Pb electrode during the charge process of LAB."
6,Conclusion,"In summary, the PCC added in the electrolyte of LAB has the following function (shown as schematic diagram shown in Fig. 8 ): (i) PCC can reduce the particle size of PbSO4 on Pb electrode when Pb electrode is under insufficient charge condition, the reduced particle size of PbSO4 makes it more electrochemically active; (ii) polyvinyl alcohol in PCC works as HER inhibitor altering the Pb/HSO4 interface, and thus inhibiting the HER rate on Pb surface; (iii) carbon in the PCC may absorbed on the surface on Pb electrode, thus increasing the electrochemical active surface during the charge process of Pb/PbSO4 electrode. Since polyvinyl alcohol and acetylene black are very common, and the preparation of PCC is rather simple, PCC holds great potential to be used in the present lead acid battery industry."
