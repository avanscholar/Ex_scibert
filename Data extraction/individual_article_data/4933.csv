0,Introduction,"Synthetic polymer membranes are of great interest in research and industry for a broad range of applications (biomedical applications, water purification, fuel cells, electrolyzers, etc.) due to their ability to selectively transport species with comparably low carbon footprint and energy requirements [1]. In energy production applications such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, polymer electrolyte membranes (PEMs) are used to transport ions between the two electrodes in order to maintain charge neutrality, while limiting the transport of oxidation and reduction products which may degrade the opposing electrolytic catalysts [2–4]. There has been extensive research on both cation (such as Nafion® 117 [5–12]) and anion (such as Selemion AMV [13–21]) exchange membranes as both of these commercially available membranes are used heavily in electrochemical systems including direct methanol fuel cells for Nafion® and vanadium redox fuel cells for Selemion AMV. Artificial photosynthesis devices are one class of electrochemical cell which splits water into hydrogen and oxygen [22], and also converts carbon dioxide into high-end products such as alcohols [23]. The polyelectrolyte membrane (PEM) in these devices plays a critical role in allowing the transport of ions (protons or hydroxyls depending on the device architecture) while hindering the transport of the many products produced due to a lack of selectivity by the metallic catalysts. Thus, it is critical to understand the transport and co-transport behavior (permeability) of these membranes to solutes (such as alcohols examined herein) which can impact device performance. The permeability of a solute is dependent on its diffusion through and solubility within that polymer membrane, as can be seen from Equation (1), known as the solution-diffusion model [24]. (1) P i = D i ⋅ K i where P i is the permeability coefficient, D i is the diffusivity coefficient, and K i is the solubility coefficient. The solution-diffusion model is commonly used for dense polymeric films (such as Nafion® and Selemion AMV) as it can be used to quantify a solute's sorption into, diffusion within, and desorption from the membrane. Recently, we have adopted an in situ attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared (ATR FTIR) spectroscopy technique to probe the permeability of polymer membranes to complex mixtures as it allows for facile determination of solute concentrations without the need for ex situ analyses [5,13,25,26] which require offline analysis [27–30]. This technique has distinct advantages over other in situ techniques such as pH [31,32] and conductivity [33,34] probes which have been used to quantify permeability without the need for aliquotic sampling, as those techniques can only quantify the permeability of a single solute through overall changes in solution character. This technique encompasses the benefits of in situ probe-based systems and multicomponent ex situ characterization. Using this methodology, the transport and co-transport behavior of the CO2 reduction products MeOH, acetate, and formate were investigated in the cation exchange membrane Nafion® 117 [5]. Interestingly, emergent transport behavior was observed where the permeability to acetate and formate generally increased in co-transport experiments while the permeability to MeOH decreased [5]. These changes were found to be correlated with solute sorption, whereas diffusion coefficients were similar, suggesting changes in solute solubility were driving the varying co-transport behavior. This type of co-transport behavior was also studied for the anion exchange membrane Selemion AMV for a different series of alcohol CO2 reduction products, namely MeOH, EtOH, and PrOH [13]. In that case, a combination of changes in solubility and diffusivity across the binary pairs and ternary mixture were found to impact the membrane permeability to each solute. For instance, permeability to MeOH increased in co-permeation with EtOH and/or PrOH while permeability to PrOH increased in co-permeation with MeOH and/or EtOH. Such changes were found to be a consequence of both solubility and diffusivity changes through competitive sorption and flux coupling [13,35]. Here, we employ in situ ATR FTIR spectroscopy to again monitor the permeation of a series of CO2 reduction product alcohols, however, here we investigate transport behavior for the cation exchange membrane Nafion® 117. Nafion® 117 consists of a polytetrafluoroethylene backbone, the chemical makeup of the chemically/thermally stable and inert Teflon™, while the side chains are polyvinylfluoroether with pendant sulfonate groups, allowing for increased swelling, and therefore, permeability of solutes. Permeability experiments were conducted for unary, binary, ternary and quaternary mixtures (16 total permeation feed solutions) using our custom-built diffusion cells outfitted with in situ ATR FTIR spectroscopy to monitor the temporal receiver cell solution concentrations of MeOH, EtOH, PrOH, and Ace. Solute sorption/desorption experiments are also performed to evaluate solute solubility for each of the 16 solute feed combinations and used to calculate solute diffusivities using the solution-diffusion model (Equation (1)). The relative changes in alcohol permeability and permselectivity are discussed, as are the underlying changes in solubility and diffusivity across this large array of solute combinations in transport and co-transport experiments."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All chemicals were used as received. Acetone (Ace) and methanol (MeOH) were purchased from British Drug House (BDH®) Chemicals (Poole, UK), ethanol (EtOH) from EMD Millipore Corporation (Burlington, MA), and n-propanol (PrOH) from Alfa Aesar (Haverhill, MA). Ultrapure (type 1) deionized (DI) water was obtained from a Labconco® Waterpro BT Purification System (18.2 MΩ cm at 28 °C, 1.2 ppb TOC) (Kansas City, MO). Nafion® 117 Lot T06C032 was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Haverhill, MA) and Lot 1709FS5172 was purchased from the Fuel Cell Store (College Station, TX), experimentally similar Lots. Nafion films were cut into 2 cm diameter circles utilizing a hammer-driven sharp, metal stamp and equilibrated in deionized water for at least 24 h prior to use."
3,Preparation of solutions for diffusion-cell experiments,"2.2 Preparation of solutions for diffusion-cell experiments Solutions were prepared in 25 mL volumetric flasks. A small amount of ultrapure water followed by the requisite quantities of MeOH, EtOH, PrOH, and/or Ace were gravimetrically pipetted into the volumetric flask. The flask was shaken to homogenize the solution and filled to the desired 25 mL volume with ultrapure water. All permeation experiments used donor solutions that were 1.0 M of each solute(s) in ultrapure water."
4,ATR-FTIR spectroscopy calibrations,"2.3 ATR-FTIR spectroscopy calibrations The attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR FTIR) spectrophotometer utilized was a Mettler Toledo ReactIR 15 with a 9.5 mm AgX Dicomp probe (Au, diamond, C22) (Columbus, OH). Five solutions were prepared ranging from 0.025 M to 0.25 M in ultrapure water. The ATR FTIR spectroscopy probe was placed in a vial of ultrapure water at 25 °C and the spectra recorded to serve as the background for subsequent spectra. After acquiring the ultrapure water spectrum, the probe was fully dried before placing into the desired calibration solution. At least three spectra were obtained for each calibration solution. Between each calibration solution, ultrapure water spectra were acquired to ensure full cleanliness of the probe. 256 scans were acquired for each spectrum and averaged to increase the signal to noise ratio. The spectra were collected from 650 cm−1 to 2500 cm−1 and each spectrum was baselined at 1149 cm−1 setting each spectrum to equal zero absorbance at this wavenumber. A two-point baseline was positioned around each peak of interest to quantify the peaks’ heights while rescinding any changes in the baseline over time: MeOH from 1033 to 983 cm−1 for its peak at 1018 cm- 1, EtOH from 1055 to 1033 cm−1 for its peak at 1044 cm−1, PrOH from 983 to 941 cm−1 for its peak at 963 cm−1, and Ace from 1770 to 1669 cm−1 for its peak at 1700 cm−1."
5,Permeation experiments,"2.4 Permeation experiments Permeation experiments were conducted in a custom-built diffusion-cell apparatus (Auburn University Glassblower, Auburn, AL) as discussed previously [25,26]. Briefly, each half-cell holds 25 mL of solution, and both halves were jacketed for thermal control using a recirculation bath to maintain the diffusion-cell temperature at 25 °C. The hydrated Nafion® 117 membrane was fastened between the two diffusion cells via metal clamp and the surface area of the membrane accessible for transport was 1.14 cm2 25 mL of ultrapure water was placed into the receiver cell and the donor solute solution was placed in the donor cell. Each cell contained a magnetic stir bar to ensure proper mixing. The probe was placed in the receiver cell and the experiment initiated. Parafilm was placed atop each cell to mitigate potential evaporation. The thickness of each membrane was measured before and after each experiment to quantify membrane swelling."
6,Characterization of solutes solubility,"2.5 Characterization of solutes solubility Solute solubility was determined using solute sorption/desorption experiments [36–39]. Fully hydrated membranes were placed in 1.0 M solute(s) mixtures. The mixtures were prepared just as the solutions for the diffusion-cell experiments, however, only 10 mL of solution were placed in the 20 mL scintillation vials. Fully hydrated Nafion films were blotted dry, cut into rounds using a 19 mm hammer-driven hole punch, and were then weighed, measured for thickness, and measured for diameter. The films were then placed in the 1.0 M solute(s) solutions and allowed to absorb solute(s) to equilibration for 3 days. After 72 h, the films were removed from the vials, blotted dry, weighed, measured for thickness, measured for diameter and then placed in 10 mL of pure DI water. This was repeated until the sorption solution (originally pure DI water) did not contain any solute(s) after 72 h. Each sorption experiment was performed in triplicate with different membranes and alcohol solutions for replicability. Solute concentrations in the desorption solutions were determined using multiple techniques for accuracy, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. To calibrate the HPLC for desorption solutions, known concentrations of solute(s) were prepared at 0.003, 0.012, and 0.025 M concentrations as the predicted desorption concentrations were within this range [38]. Solutions were prepared analogous to the ATR FTIR calibration solutions described above, however, a 250 mL volumetric flask was used instead of a 25 mL flask as the concentrations are dilute. To quantify the concentration of alcohols, the samples were determined by HPLC equipped with RI detector using an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The column temperature was maintained at 60 °C. The mobile phase was composed of 5 mM sulfuric acid in deionized water running at 0.55 mL/min. The injected sample size was 10 μL. Solute concentrations determined using NMR spectroscopy were performed on a 600 MHz Avance II Bruker NMR (Auburn Chemistry Dept., AL) spectrometer using TopSpin 3.2. The sorption solutions were transferred into NMR tubes gravimetrically, as was deuterium oxide (the deuterated solvent, in a 90 vol% H2O/10 vol% D2O ratio) and benzyl alcohol (as the spectral reference material). Each solution was tested in triplicate, with 4 scans each using a water suppression technique, by presaturation during relaxation delay and mixing time, as the concentration(s) of solute(s) are dilute."

8,Quantitative multicomponent aqueous solute concentrations using in situ ATR FTIR spectroscopy,"3.1 Quantitative multicomponent aqueous solute concentrations using in situ ATR FTIR spectroscopy In order to monitor receiver-cell solute concentrations for multicomponent transport experiments we deploy in situ ATR FTIR spectroscopy and first validate our capability to do so quantitatively for mixtures of our solutes of interest. The absorption of light as it passes through an analyte is described by the Beer-Lambert Law. As described previously, due to pathlength equivalence at each wavenumber, we utilize an effective molar absorptivity, ε λ , such that A λ = ε λ C, where A λ is the absorbance at wavenumber λ and C is the solute concentration [5,13]. The concentration of a single solute can be determined from the measured absorbance from the ATR FTIR spectra given these effective extinction coefficients are known. Spectra were obtained for MeOH, EtOH, PrOH, and Ace in 1.0 M aqueous solutions with the ATR FTIR spectrophotometer to assess spectral overlap and potential wavenumbers of interest. In each spectrum, the absorbance of pure DI water is subtracted such that the spectra shown in Fig. 1 a correspond solely to the absorbance contributions from MeOH, EtOH, PrOH, and Ace, respectively. Each solute displays distinct absorption peaks at various wavenumbers due to their dissimilar dipole moments when absorbing IR radiation [27]. (See Fig. 2) To determine effective molar absorptivities of each solute, a series of standard aqueous solutions of MeOH, EtOH, PrOH, and Ace at known concentrations from 0.025 to 0.25 M were prepared and their ATR FTIR spectra acquired (Fig. 1b for the four-component mixture). This concentration range was chosen to be consistent with the concentration range of interest for subsequent diffusion-cell experiments and analysis via the Yasuda model [28]. The wavenumbers were chosen, noted via asterisks in Fig. 1a, to minimize overlap between solutes and maximize sensitivity to changes in concentration; i.e. larger effective extinction coefficients are preferred as ε λ = dA/dC. Each calibration was performed three separate times using newly prepared solutions. The effective molar absorptivity at each wavenumber of interest for each solute was determined from a linear least-squares regression fit of the acquired absorbances from all three calibration experiments (Fig. 3 ). Overall, excellent linear fits to the acquired absorbance data and typical squared correlation coefficients (R2) values greater than 0.98 were obtained (see Table S1 for a compilation of all calculated effective molar absorptivities and associated R2 values). For multicomponent solutions, the absorbance, A i , at each wavenumber i is a summation of the absorbance contributions from each solute j: (2) A i = ∑ i = 1 j = 1 n ε i , j C j The concentration of n aqueous solutes using water-subtracted FTIR spectra can thereby be calculated using a system of n equations. For two solutes (A & B), Equation (2) can be written to describe the absorbance at two wavenumbers (A1 & A2) for two unknown concentrations (CA and CB). (3) A 1 = ε A 1 C A + ε B 1 C B (4) A 2 = ε A 2 C A + ε B 2 C B These equations can be solved simultaneously through rearrangement and substitution as shown in Equations (5) and (6), where CB can first be obtained directly absorbance data (Equation (6)) followed by CA (Equation (5)). (5) C A = A 1 − ε B 1 C B ε A 1 (6) C B = ε A 1 A 2 − ε A 2 A 1 ε A 1 ε B 2 − ε A 2 ε B 1 Equation (2) can also be expanded for three solutes (A, B and C) utilizing the absorbances at three wavenumbers (A1, A2 and A3) to calculate for the three unknown concentrations (CA, CB and CC) (Equations (7)–(9)). (7) A 1 = ε A 1 C A + ε B 1 C B + ε C 1 C C (8) A 2 = ε A 2 C A + ε B 2 C B + ε C 2 C C (9) A 3 = ε A 3 C A + ε B 3 C B + ε C 3 C C Similarly, this expansion for four solutes using the absorbances at four distinct wavenumbers is used to determine the four unknown concentrations (Equations (10)–(13)). (10) A 1 = ε A 1 C A + ε B 1 C B + ε C 1 C C + ε D 1 C D (11) A 2 = ε A 2 C A + ε B 2 C B + ε C 2 C C + ε D 2 C D (12) A 3 = ε A 3 C A + ε B 3 C B + ε C 3 C C + ε D 3 C D (13) A 4 = ε A 4 C A + ε B 4 C B + ε C 4 C C + ε D 4 C D These equations were utilized to calculate multiple components in solution from the known effective extinction coefficients. To validate this methodology for determining the concentrations of the multiple solutes of interest, a series of two-component solutions were prepared with solute concentrations of 0.025 M, 0.05 M, 0.10 M, 0.15 M, and 0.25 M. Each set of experiments contained five equal solute concentrations and two opposing concentrations (0.025 M of solute A and 0.25 M of solute B and vice versa) to ensure that the equations and effective molar absorptivities held, even if there was overlap or differing solute concentrations. Each of the solute concentrations were determined from the solution absorbance and the above described effective extinction coefficients and systems of concentration equations. Fig. 3 shows a comparison between the measured and actual concentrations of each solute for of the three solute combinations (Fig. 3a–d) and the four solute (MeOH, EtOH, PrOH, and Ace) mixture (Fig. 3e). Analogous plots for each of the binary component mixtures are shown in Fig. S1. The identity line (y = x) is provided as a guide as this corresponds to complete agreement between the actual and measured solution concentrations. As is clear from Fig. 4 , the concentrations calculated from the infrared absorbances and effective molar absorptivities are very close to the identity line, with all lying within 0.02 M, signifying excellent agreement. Comparable results have been previously reported for MeOH, EtOH, and PrOH and their binary and ternary mixtures [13]. The results here confirm these prior results and expand upon these validations to additional binary, ternary and here even quaternary mixtures. Overall, we find this facile technique can be used to determine unknown concentrations of these four solutes in their various complex mixtures, and as demonstrated in the following sections, the in-situ monitoring of solute concentrations in these complex mixtures."
9,"Permeability of Nafion® 117 to MeOH, EtOH, PrOH, and Ace","3.2 Permeability of Nafion® 117 to MeOH, EtOH, PrOH, and Ace Nafion® 117 is a dense, non-porous membrane, and its permeability to solutes is described by the solution-diffusion model [24]. Permeation of a solute from the donor chamber through a dense and hydrated polymer membrane to the receiver chamber is a consequence of the chemical potential difference and permeability of the membrane to the solute is extracted from measuring the time-resolved receiver cell concentration. Utilizing our custom-built diffusion cell with in situ ATR FTIR spectroscopy, the permeabilities of Nafion® 117 to MeOH, EtOH, PrOH, and Ace in one, two, three and four component mixtures were determined using the Yasuda model to extract permeability from concentration versus time data for hydrated polymeric membranes [28]. The Yasuda model (Equation (14)) describes the transport of ions and small molecules through hydrated, dense polymeric membranes [28,29] to calculate the diffusive permeability of the solute i, P i , (14) ln ( 1 - 2 C i t C i 0 ) = P i ( − 2 A t V ℓ ) where C i t is calculated from the measured absorbance in the receiver cell with in situ ATR FTIR spectroscopy, C i 0 is the initial feed concentration of solute i (1.0 M), and the membrane thickness, l, is measured with a using a digital caliper (±1 μm) after the permeation experiment to account for osmotic de-swelling [5,30] effects. This model is commonly used for measuring permeability in hydrated, dense, polymer membranes such as hydrogels, dialysis membranes, and ion exchange membranes such as Nafion® 117 and Selemion AMV [5,13,29,30,40]. Diffusion cells were jacketed at 25 °C, well mixed with teflon-coated stir bars, covered with parafilm to diminish evaporation effects, and each permeability experiment was performed in triplicate. The 3D ATR FTIR spectra and extracted concentration versus time data for the single component permeability of Nafion® 117 to MeOH are shown in Fig. 4. All permeation experiments utilized donor solutions that were 1.0 M of the solute of interest for that experiment. In Fig. 4, data from each of the three permeation experiments is fitted with the Yasuda model (dotted lines), the permeability calculated and used to calculate an average extracted permeability which is used shown on Fig. 4 using the Yasuda model (solid line). This average permeability is extracted from each set of diffusion cell experiments for each solute and is the value used for calculations and comparisons herein. Analogous single component concentration versus time plots for all other solutes are provided in Fig. S2 a-d and the permeabilities of Nafion® 117 to each species are given in Table 1 . The permeability to MeOH is within the reported literature range [5,41–47], as a validating check that this technique is adequate for quantifying membrane permeability. Compared to MeOH, the permeabilities to EtOH and PrOH decrease 12% and 19% respectively, consistent with their larger molecular size; kinetic diameters for MeOH, EtOH, and PrOH are 0.38 nm, 0.43 nm, and 0.47 nm respectively [48]. In that respect, acetone is an outlier as it is a large solute (kinetic diameter of 0.47 nm [48]), yet displays the highest permeability. Ace enolizes in water resulting in a more positive hydroxyl carbon and behaves as a diol in these solutions [49]. Ace's behavior here is anticipated as it has previously been found to exhibit a higher diffusivity in polymer thin films than both MeOH and EtOH [50], and is known for exhibiting a similarly higher permeability [51] in polymer membranes attributed to a combination of lower solute viscosity and differences in swelling behavior [52]. This follows the trends observed by Godino et al. where viscosity and permeability are proportional when observing methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, and 2-propanol transport through Nafion® 117; see Fig. S3 [52]. As the viscosity of the solute increases, the transport rate decreases as the solution is less available to transport through the available free volume."
10,"Multi-component permeability of Nafion® 117 to MeOH, EtOH, PrOH, and Ace","3.3 Multi-component permeability of Nafion® 117 to MeOH, EtOH, PrOH, and Ace Multi-component permeability experiments were performed to calculate true selectivity for all six binary pairs, all four three-component sets, and the complex mixture of all four solutes investigated herein. These experiments thereby incorporate any solute-solute interactions or solute-membrane interactions that impact transport behavior in these more complex mixtures. All permeation experiments utilized donor solutions that were 1.0 M of each of the solutes of interest for that experiment. To begin, a representative concentration versus time plot for all six of the binary pairs of solutes is shown in Fig. 5 ; see Fig. S4 a-f for analogous plots for other multicomponent experiments. The concentration versus time data for each solute in each experiment was fitted using the Yasuda model to extract the permeability for each solute in each case (Table 2 ). From a cursory glance at Table 2, it is clear that the multi-component permeabilities for some solutes in mixtures deviate from their single solute permeability, while others do not. As multiple solutes transport through the same membrane fractional free volume, an overall decrease in permeability of individual solutes could be expected. However, the two component permeabilities increased in 21% of the cases when compared to the single component permeabilities. Permeability to MeOH was found to increase in binary permeation experiments with all three co-solutes. In a binary mixture with EtOH, the MeOH permeability increases but is within the standard deviation of our data. Meanwhile, the largest and most significant increase (17%) is observed for co-permeation with acetone. Alternatively, the permeability to PrOH is observed to both increase and decrease depending on the co-solute in the binary mixture. For instance, the permeability to PrOH decreases 25% in co-permeation with EtOH, while in co-permeation with Ace it increases 5%. Similar behavior is observed for EtOH, where the permeability to EtOH increases 20% in co-permeation with PrOH and decreases 6% in co-permeation with Ace. As the permeability for MeOH, EtOH, and PrOH in Nafion® 117 is an order of magnitude greater than that measured for their transport in Selemion AMV, we make no attempt at direct comparison of their transport and co-transport behavior here other to note this difference, and that it is a consequence of both higher solubility and diffusivity for these solutes (as described below [13]). These changes in solute permeability can also be assessed through the lens of permselectivity to examine changes in relative permeability, and how these permeability changes would impact membrane separations. Membrane selectivity (αi/j), calculated using Equation (15), quantifies a membrane's preference for transporting one molecule compared to another based upon their relative permeability values (Pi and Pj for components i and j, respectively). (15) α i / j = P i P j Here, selectivity is calculated using the traditional single-solute diffusion cell experiment permeabilities and denoted as the ‘ideal’ selectivity. As this ideal selectivity is based on the single-solute permeability values, it does not consider any specific interactions between solutes and the membrane which may impact solute transport behavior. The selectivity from the binary pair diffusion cell experiments is also calculated and denoted the ‘true’ selectivity. Obtained values for both ideal and true selectivity for each binary pair of solutes are shown in Table 3 . For consistency, the order of preference for the numerator permeability in calculating the permeability was MeOH, EtOH, PrOH, and Ace which results in selectivity values less than one in some cases. The ‘ideal’ selectivity is the traditional selectivity determined from diffusion cell experiments and generally used for membrane selection. As shown in Table 3, large differences are observed between these two selectivity values illustrating the importance of investigating multi-component transport behavior to account for the complex array of solute-solute and multiple solute-membranes interactions which can occur. For instance, for EtOH and PrOH the true selectivity was 60% greater than the ideal selectivity due to an increasing EtOH permeability in the presence of PrOH, and a decreasing PrOH permeability in the presence of EtOH. Alternatively, for MeOH and Ace, the permeability to Ace is unchanged and permeability to MeOH increases in the binary case resulting in a higher selectivity for MeOH. Overall, these differences between ideal and true selectivity values ranged from insignificant (e.g. for EtOH and Ace) to quite large (60% for EtOH and PrOH) depending upon the solute pair, and these type of effects have been previously attributed to complementary and competitive sorption within the membrane [38,53,54] as well as coupled fluxes [55,56]. The permeability values for the three- and four-component diffusion cell experiments were then considered. As with the binary pairs, evaluation of the changes in permeability for three and four solute mixtures also displays complex behavior depending on the solutes. In the three solute permeabilities, decreased permeability is observed for MeOH and PrOH in all cases compared to both the single-solute and binary pair permeabilities. Alternatively, the permeability to Ace is slightly decreased but within the standard deviation of its single solute permeability. Meanwhile, the change in permeability to EtOH in two three-component mixtures with MeOH, namely MeOH–EtOH-PrOH and MeOH–EtOH-Ace, exhibit lower EtOH permeabilities while permeability to EtOH, PrOH, and Ace is unchanged compared to the single solute permeabilities. In the four-component mixture, permeabilities to PrOH and Ace were close to those from single solute experiments, while permeabilities to MeOH and EtOH increased. This last mixture is quite interesting as one expects the permeability to generally decrease with these additional solutes co-permeating and thereby occupying the limited membrane fractional free volume. As Nafion® 117 is not a crosslinked membrane, the presence of different solutes can influence the size and arrangement of both hydrophobic regions and ionic clusters and lead to differences in solute uptake, diffusivity and ultimately permeability. Overall, the variation in permeability in direction and magnitude for different co-solute mixtures highlights the complexity in predicting multi-solute transport behavior from single-solute permeability experiments."
11,"Solubility and diffusivity of MeOH, EtOH, PrOH, and Ace in Nafion® 117","3.4 Solubility and diffusivity of MeOH, EtOH, PrOH, and Ace in Nafion® 117 The well-known solution diffusion model (Equation (1)) describes permeability of a membrane to a solute as the product of the thermodynamic solubility and the kinetic diffusivity [5,47,57,58]. The solubility of a membrane to a solute describes the thermodynamic partitioning, or the membrane's affinity, of a solute into the membrane, and the diffusivity describes the solute movement through the polymer membrane. Characterization of these quantities can thereby provide insight into the essential properties that govern the observed permeabilities. The solubilities of MeOH, EtOH, PrOH, Ace, and their binary mixtures in Nafion® 117 are shown in Table 4 . First, we examine the solubilities from single-component solutions. A range of values from 0.4 to 1.0 have been reported for the solubility of MeOH in Nafion® 117 with measurements from a variety of techniques and different membrane pretreatments [5,7,59]. The solubility found here is in the middle of this reported range. Interestingly, the solubility to EtOH and PrOH are increasingly greater than that of MeOH in contrast to the observed decreasing solute permeabilities for these larger solutes. It should also be noted that this trend is also consistent with the relative alcohols' solubility parameters for MeOH, EtOH, and PrOH which show an increasing solubility with decreasing solubility parameter; solubility parameter decreases with increasing alkyl chain length [60]. However, Ace falls outside of this trend as it has the smallest solubility parameter, yet a solubility lower than both EtOH and PrOH but higher than MeOH. This is a confirmation of our description above from the solute permeabilities that the solute size is a primary contributor to the observed differences in permeability. The solubility to Ace again does not follow this trend as its solubility falls between that of MeOH and EtOH indicating a higher membrane affinity to Ace than MeOH, however this higher solubility alone would not account for Ace exhibiting the highest permeability. The solubilities extracted from binary solution sorption measurements are more complex and are found to increase, decrease, or remain unchanged depending on the co-solute. The solubility of MeOH increases significantly (86%) in the presence of EtOH, but decreases with PrOH (9%) or Ace (35%) as the co-solute. The solubility of EtOH increases with MeOH as the co-solute (20%), yet is essentially unchanged with either PrOH or Ace as the co-solute. For MeOH, EtOH, and PrOH the solubility increases in the binary mixture case if the co-solute is MeOH or EtOH, and decreases or remains unchanged if the co-solute is PrOH or Ace. Ace, again, is an outlier in this respect as, while its solubility does decrease with PrOH as the co-solute, its solubility decreases with MeOH and remains unchanged with EtOH as the co-solute. Relating these changes in solute solubility to the observed changes in solute permeability also does not follow a single trend (e.g. decreasing solubility and decreasing permeability are not universally linked across the binary pairs). For instance, while the permeability and solubility to MeOH both increase with EtOH as the co-solute, the permeability to MeOH increases and the solubility decreases with Ace as the co-solute. Interestingly, for PrOH, the changes in permeability and solubility are inversely correlated. The permeability to PrOH decreases and the solubility increases with MeOH and EtOH as the co-solutes, while the permeability increases and solubility decreases with Ace as the co-solute. The solute diffusivities, shown in Table 5 , are calculated from the measured permeability and solubility for each solute using the solution-diffusion model (Equation (1)). Changes in solute diffusivity are thereby also dependent on co-solute(s) and is directly linked (inversely) to the relative changes in solubility discussed above. Each solute's diffusivity increases from single to multicomponent experiments when co-transporting with PrOH, and nearly all increase when co-transporting with Ace (either increased or relatively unchanged). For co-transporting with MeOH, both EtOH and PrOH diffusivities decrease while Ace increases. Meanwhile, the diffusivity of each solute co-transporting with EtOH decreases from single to multicomponent experiments. Again, these diffusivity changes do not directly correlate to changes in solute permeability, just as the solute solubilities do not correlate. In other words, the transport of these 4 charge neutral solutes through charged Nafion is driven by changes in both solubility and diffusivity. A final lens through which to view these changes is through changes in the solubility-selectivity and diffusivity-selectivity (ratios of solubility and diffusivity, respectively). This analysis gives a good visual representation of how the relative differences in permeability, solubility, and diffusivity between the single and binary component experiments are impacting transport behavior. Solubility selectivity and diffusivity selectivity are calculated for each binary pair using the single component data (ideal selectivity, solid bars) and binary data (true selectivity, outlined bars) and presented in Fig. 6 , the values are contained in Table S2. For instance, the two binary pairs with the largest differences in permselectivity—MeOH/PrOH and EtOH/PrOH—both show large differences in diffusivity selectivity (Fig. 6b). In the case of EtOH and Ace, while changes in permeability, solubility, and diffusivity were observed, all three of the selectivities (permselectivity, solubility-selectivity, and diffusivity-selectivity) are essentially unchanged. For MeOH/EtOH copermeation the slightly increased permselectivity is due to an increasing solubility-selectivity and decreasing diffusivity-selectivity nearly offsetting one another and not the presence of a co-solute having no impact on the transport behavior. Alternatively, the opposite is observed (decreasing solubility-selectivity and increasing diffusivity-selectivity) for MeOH/Ace also leading to a slightly increased permselectivity. Meanwhile, for PrOH and Ace a 20% increase in permselectivity is observed which is a result in a significant increase in the solubility-selectivity (38%) and smaller decrease in diffusivity-selectivity (13%). While observation of these changes is an important first step, a firm understanding on the underlying phenomena leading to these disparate changes for these structurally similar alcohol solutes (and the transport behavior of complex mixtures in general) remains an open challenge in membrane science."
12,Conclusions,"An in-situ ATR FTIR spectrometer probe was used to accurately characterize up to 4 simultaneous solutes in solution, following calibrations for each solute at each wavenumber of interest. Exploiting the measured effective extinction coefficients, the permeabilities to MeOH, EtOH, PrOH, and Ace were determined in single, double, triple, and quadruple component aqueous diffusion cell experiments. The observed changes in permeability are complex and, in some cases, significant. This was exemplified by comparison of ‘ideal’ and ‘true’ permselectivity determined from single solute and two-solute diffusion cell experiments, respectively, which were found to vary by as much as 60% (for EtOH/PrOH). The underlying cause of these changes was probed using a well-known sorption-desorption technique to measure membrane solubility for each solute and binary pairs of solutes from aqueous solutions. Changes in solute solubility and diffusivity are inversely correlated (as expected through the solution-diffusion model) and changes in solubility and diffusivity were found to impact the observed permeability. Understanding the transport behavior for solutes in complex mixtures is a challenge requiring significant more experimentation to elucidate governing trends in behavior based on solute and membrane characteristics. For the series of solutes here, changes in their permeation behavior in Nafion® 117 are a result of changes in both solubility and diffusivity and are shown to have potentially large impacts on the resulting permselectivity."
