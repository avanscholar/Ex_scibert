0,Introduction,"The undue exploitation and utilization of non-renewable resources like traditional fossil fuels has caused increasingly serious environmental pollution and energy crisis. It is believed that hydrogen energy is an available candidate of fossil energy due to its cleanness, efficiency, and recyclability. To date, much attention has been paid to the electrolysis of water which was considered as a straight-forward and simple method for production of high purity hydrogen [1]. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as a half reaction of the electrolysis of water happens on cathode with the help of electrocatalysts. At the moment, Pt-based electrocatalysts exhibit highly excellent HER performance because of the appropriate hydrogen adsorption free energy [2]. Nevertheless, high costs, low reserves, and catalyst poisoning have restricted the large-scale applications of Pt-based electrocatalysts in industry. Therefore, the exploitation and development of non-noble metal electrocatalysts with high performance and stability has become a significant and hot research [3]. The transition metal phosphides (TMPs), such as Ni3P [4,5], Cu3P [6], and Co2P [7,8], show superior performance for HER, which are expected to replace Pt-based electrocatalysts. The excellent properties of TMPs are attributed to the fact that P atoms with high electronegativity can attract electrons from metal atoms to expose highly active sites and the negatively charged P can act as a base to trap positively charged protons [9]. While these TMPs showed high catalytic activity, the obvious drawbacks were usually uncontrollable in structure and morphology, and which were restricted by the implementation of nanometer and sufficient security [10,11]. Phytic acid (PA) displays strong cross-link ability to the metal derived from six phosphate groups[12], which can be used to prepare TMPs through chelation with metal to control the morphology and molecular structure of product. Lou et al synthesized Ni-doped FeP/C hollow nanorods utilizing PA as etchant and phosphorus source, which exhibited excellent HER properties with the overpotential of 72, 117, and 95 mV for 10 mA cm−2 in acidic, neutral, and alkaline solution, respectively[13]. In addition, the PA is a green phosphours source, which prevents the production of toxic gases like phosphine gas (PH3) from hypophosphites (NH4H2PO2 and NaH2PO2)[14,15]. Hence, it is worth researching PA to safely and controllably synthesize TMPs, especially for the research of preparing three-dimensional (3D) nanostructured TMPs catalysts that has not yet been reported. Note that the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as another half reaction of water electrolysis on anode, principally decides the energy consumption of overall water splitting because of its slow kinetics process[16,17]. To decrease the energy consumption and enhance energy conversion efficiency of water electrolysis, substitution of anodic reaction is a practical and highly effective strategy. Reactions that replace OER currently incorporate anodic degradation currently incorporate anodic degradation (urea[18], toluene[19], hydrazine[20]), anodic synthesis (amine[21], 5-hydroxymethylfurfural[22], lignocellulose[23]), and low potential reaction of metal (Fe3+/Fe2+ and Fe/Fe2+)[24,25]. Formaldehyde (HCHO), a harmful pollutant, exists in industrial wastewater far and wide. Generally, HCHO wastewater is treated by physicochemical oxidation requiring a large number of reagents like hydrogen peroxide with high consumption or biological method with harsh condition and limits[26,27]. Electrocatalytic oxidation of formaldehyde is a simple and highly efficient method for innocent treatment of HCHO, which is subject to the development of electrocatalyst. To date, Pt-group catalysts such as Pt, Au, Pd, which are sdudied widely, display outstanding activity for electrocatalytic oxidation reaction of formaldehyde (FOR), but they can't be applied on a large scale because of the poisoning and high price[28]. Besides, Tang et al reported the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of formaldehyde to methanol in 0.1 M Na2SO4 using a Pt single-atom catalyst for the first and only time[29]. Therefore, high-efficiency non-noble metal catalysts, such as Ni and Co based transition metal catalysts for electrocatalysis, are urgently needed to be developed and applied to the electrocatalytic oxidation and hydrogenation of formaldehyde so as to realize the harmlessness and resource recovery of HCHO. Simultaneously, FOR and HER can be coupled to optimize the hydrogen production, which has been hitherto unconfirmed. Moreover, the catalytic efficiency of electrocatalysts is able to be improved by tuning their conductivity, morphologies and structural composition, as reported[30], which is our strategy and goal. In this work, we reported NiCo-NiCoP nanoparticles embedded into P-doped carbon nanotube on carbon cloth (NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC) as multifunctional electrocatalyst, which was synthesized via the chelation of PA and cobalt–nickel carbonate hydroxide nanowires, followed by the thermal reduction reaction and phosphating reaction by carbon and P source derived from PA. The HER performance of the electrocatalyst as well as the optimization of FOR to water splitting were systematically investigated in alkaline solution. Subsequently, a two-electrode electrolyzer was constructed using the NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC as cathode and anode. The two-electrode electrolyzer was able to achieve the same current density (50 mA cm−2) with a lower voltage of 1.76 V in HCHO-based water splitting compared to that of conventional water splitting (2.07 V), which save about 320 mV. Besides, hydrogenation reduction reaction of formaldehyde occurred at the cathode at the same time, which realized the upgraded conversion and resource utilization of HCHO. This work not only provided a controllable approach to safely synthesize 3D nanostructured TMPs utilizing PA as P source and chelating agent, but also presented a new construction of electrochemical cell to achieve efficient hydrogen energy preparation and environmental management simultaneously."

3,Synthesis of cobalt–nickel carbonate hydroxide on carbon cloth (Ni-Co-precursor/CC),"2.2 Synthesis of cobalt–nickel carbonate hydroxide on carbon cloth (Ni-Co-precursor/CC) In a typical procedure, a piece of CC (2 × 3 cm2) pretreated by oxygen plasma (Atto-BLS, Diener Electronic) for 10 min was placed in a 15 mL limpid pink solution containing 1.0 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.5 mmol Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 4.5 mmol urea. Subsequently, the obtained solution placed CC was shifted into a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. Then hydrothermal treatment was carried out at 120 °C for 6 h.

After cooling to room temperature naturally, the sample was cleaned by ethanol and then dried in oven at 60 °C for 6 h. In addition, the different amounts of PA (0.45, 0.9, and 1.2 µM) and solvent (DMF and deionized water) were considered to study the effect to product."
5,Synthesis of NiCo-NiCoP nanoparticles embedded into P-doped carbon nanotubes on carbon cloth (NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC),"2.4 Synthesis of NiCo-NiCoP nanoparticles embedded into P-doped carbon nanotubes on carbon cloth (NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC) The Ni-Co@PA/CC (Co/Ni-PA/CC) was transferred into a tube furnace and heated at 450 °C for 2 h under Ar-H2 (10%) atmosphere to synthesize the final sample NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC. The mass loading of NiCo-NiCoP@PCT is ∼ 0.45 mg cm−2. In addition, the different calcination temperature of 350, 550, and 650 °C were also applied for this synthesis."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization Phase component of the as-prepared catalysts were tested by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Germany Bruker, D8 Advance) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). In Situ X-ray Diffraction of High Temperature (HT-XRD) experiment was implemented under Ar-H2 (5%) mixture gas in a white Al2O3 crucible with 12 mm inner diameter. Each scan was gathered between 20° and 60° in 0.02° increments with the scanning speed of 0.04° per second. To insure sufficient time to trace the reaction during the calcination course, the time interval was set for 600 s each scan. Morphologies of the catalysts were confirmed by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Regulus 8100) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100F Field Emission Electron Microscope, JPN, 200 kV). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS, Ulvac-Phi) was employed to detect the surface chemical state of samples."
7,Electrochemical measurements,"2.6 Electrochemical measurements All the electrochemical tests were carried out with an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760e, CH Instruments Inc.) in 1.0 M KOH media with or without HCHO using three-electrode or two-electrode configuration. In the three-electrode configuration, as-made catalysts were directly employed as the working electrode with Hg/HgO electrode(reference electrode) and carbon rod (counter electrode). For two-electrode electrolysis, NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC was employed as both anode and cathode. 5 mg 20 wt% Pt/C or RuO2 was dispersed in 500 µL D.I water, 450 µL ethanol, and 50 µL Nafion generating a uniform suspended solution to prepare corresponding electrode with 5 µL which was dripped onto the glassy-carbon electrode. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were achieved by sweeping the potential from 0 to − 0.65 V vs. RHE (from 0 to 2.4 V in the two-electrode configuration) with a potential scan rate of 5 mV s−1. Overall electrochemical measurements were implemented without iR-correction. Alternating current impedance was tested at a frequency ranging from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz with an amplitude of 10 mV. The obtained electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) patterns were fitted using a simplified equivalent circuit, which was composed of a resistance (Rs), charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and a constant phase element (CPE). The parallel Rct and CPE are connected in series with Rs, and the matching arguments were evaluated by the Levenberg-Marquardt minimization program. The electrochemical bilayer capacitance was measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at non-faradaic voltages to calculate the efficient electrochemical area of catalytic reaction. The current–time curves were tested by chronoamperometric methods. The produced hydrogen was detected by an online gas chromatograph (HXSP-GC950, China, TCD, nitrogen as a carrier gas and 5 Å molecular sieve column). The produced methanol was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (LC, shodex, R1-201H). Formaldehyde concentration was analyzed by the Acetylacetone spectrophotometric method referring to GB 13197–91 in a Unico-UV 2100 UV–visible spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 414 nm."
8,Results and discussion,"Herein, the heterostructured NiCo-NiCoP nanoparticles embedded into P-doped carbon nanotubes on carbon cloth (NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC) was synthesized through the chelation of PA and Ni-Co-precursor nanowires along with the subsequent thermal reduction. The according synthesis schematic diagram was shown in Fig. 1 a. First, the Ni-Co-precursor nanowires were synthesized on CC by hydrothermal method. Second, the Ni-Co@PA was coated on the surface of Ni-Co-precursor nanowires via the complexation reaction between metal ions and PA, the according molecular structure as shown in Figure S1 . At last, the heterostructured NiCo-NiCoP nanoparticles embedded into P-doped carbon nanotubes on carbon cloth were synthesized by phosphating and thermal reduction reactions. The obtained NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC was evaluated as bifunctional electrocatalysts for HER and FOR in a coupled system as shown in Fig. 1 b. First, the HCHO was oxidized on the anode into CO2 to achieve pollutant degradation (HCHO + 8OH− → CO2 + O2 + 5H2O + 8e−). Second, compared to the OER, the FOR with lower anodization voltage decreased the energy consumption of hydrogen production with small water splitting voltage. Third, the upgraded conversion from HCHO pollutant to CH3OH fuel was achieved by simultaneous hydrogenation on the cathode using the hydrogen source in water along with HER (HCHO + 4H+ + 4e− → CH3OH + H2). The photographs of the synthesized samples at each step were shown in Figure S2 , and the final black sample of NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC was different from the previous samples. Firstly, according to previous research[31], the successfully synthesized Ni-Co-precursor nanowires with smooth surface (Fig. 2 a and S3b) were observed by SEM compared to the pristine carbon cloth ( Figure S4 ). The XRD (Fig. 2 e) confirmed that the nanowires was Co(CO3)0.5(OH)·0·.11H2O (JCPDS No. 48–0083) with characteristic peaks at 26.75° (220), 30.44° (300), 33.82° (221), 35.30° (040), 36.53° (301), 39.61° (231), and 47.30° (340). It was worth noting that the wide peak around 25° came from the CC substrate. Moreover, Ni element was also detected by EDS elemental mapping ( Figure S3 d), implying the Ni doping into Co(CO3)0.5(OH)·0··11H2O After the complexation reaction with PA, the Ni-Co-precursor was transformed to core–shell structure of Ni-Co@PA, and the morphology of nanowires was retained, as shown in Fig. 2 b and S3b. The characteristic peaks of Co(CO3)0.5(OH)·0·.11H2O were still observed by XRD in Fig. 2 e, confirming the retention of the Ni-Co-precursor. And the elemental mapping showed the distribution of P ( Figure S3 e), confirming the introduction from PA. At last, among the process of calcining Ni-Co@PA at 450 °C for 2 h with H2/Ar atmosphere, the phosphating reaction of P and reduction reaction of C from PA were carried out to synthesize NiCo-NiCoP nanoparticles embedded into P-doped carbon nanotubes. The SEM images in Fig. 2 c, 2d and S3c revealed the rough and porous nanowires. The XRD pattern (Fig. 2 e) confirmed the NiCoP phase (JCPDS No. 71–2336) with characteristic peak at 40.98° (111), meanwhile the peaks located at 44.50° corresponded to the (111) lattice planes of metallic Ni (JCPDS No. 04–0850) or Co (JCPDS No. 15–0806), demonstrated the NiCo phase. To investigate the phase transformations during the calcination of Ni-Co-precursor, an in situ X-ray diffraction of High Temperature (HT-XRD) was measured every 20 °C in the range of 300–700 °C for keeping 10 min each time in Ar/H2 atmosphere. These diffraction peaks at 34.63°, 42.8°, 52.02° and 56.96° were attributed to Al2O3 substrate, which reflected from the crucible. In Fig. 2 f, the diffraction peak at 33.6° according to (221) of Co(CO3)0.5(OH)·0·.11H2O could be found below 350 °C. As observed, the new diffraction peaks at 44.17° appeared above 325 °C, indicating the prior growth of (111) plane of NiCo. It is worth noting that the (111) plane of NiCoP at 40.4° was gradually evolved from 450 °C. When the temperature rose to ∼ 550 °C, a new peak sited in 50.97° began to arise, which corresponded to the (200) plane of NiCo. As a whole, with the increase of temperature, the sequence of the phase transformations was (111) plane of NiCo, (111) plane of NiCoP and (200) of NiCo. This result was consistent with the XRD results at different calcination temperatures of 350 °C, 450 °C, 550 °C, and 650 °C, as shown in Figure S5 . In addition, the morphology of nanowire remained well below 550 °C, while nanowires collapsed into nanoparticles on the CC at high temperature of 650 °C ( Figure S6 ). Therefore, the calcination temperature of 450 °C was beneficial to the formation of phase and the optimization of morphology. Moreover, we investigated the effect of the concentration of PA, solvent, and the calcination temperature on morphologies and structures of samples. As shown in Figure S7 , with the increase of PA, the nanowires gradually disappeared due to the faster acid etching of PA with high concentration. In addition, when the deionized water instead of DMF was used in the process, no nanowires were remained ( Figure S7 a), implying that the DMF slowed down the reaction between Ni-Co-precursor and PA. The surface chemical state and compositions of Ni-Co-precursor/CC, Ni-Co@PA/CC, and NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC were tested by XPS measurement. XPS spectrums of Ni 2p, Co 2p and P 2p core levels of three samples were corrected by C1s peak at 284.5 eV for accuracy, which were showed in Fig. 2 f-h. The XPS survey spectra ( Figure S8 ) revealed the presence of Co, Ni, P, O, C in Ni-Co@PA/CC and NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC, which confirmed the introdution of P by PA. As illustrated in Fig. 2 f, the peaks located at 874.5 eV and 856.3 eV in NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC can be put down to the spin–orbit doublets characteristic of Ni 2P3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 spectrum species accompanied by corresponding satellite peaks located in 880.3 and 861.1 eV[32], suggesting the appearance of Ni-POx. Compared to Ni-Co-precursor/CC and Ni-Co@PA/CC, the peaks of Ni 2p for NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC were positively shifted, indicating the partially charged Ni from the Ni-P bonding[33]. In addition, the new binding energy (BE) peaks at 853.1 eV and 870.4 eV in NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC assigned to Ni, suggesting the presence of metallic NiCo[34]. Similarly, compared to Ni-Co-precursor/CC and Ni-Co@PA/CC, the positive shift of Co 2p and metallic Co were also detected in NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC, which was consistent with that of Ni. For the P 2p region in NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC, the BE peaks at 130.4 and 129.5 eV were matched to the Ni/Co-P bonding[35]. Moreover, the peak sited in 133.1 eV of NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC was attributed to P-O bonding from oxidized P species during air exposure[36]. Furthermore, peaks at 132.9 and 131.8 eV in Ni-Co@PA/CC were matched to P = O and P-O bonding respectively corresponding to the molecular structure of PA, while no characteristic peak appeared in Ni-Co-precursor/CC indicating the introduction of P from PA. In addition, the existence of P-C bond at 285.1 eV was verified in NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC, confirming the formation of P-doped carbon which did not formed in Ni-Co-precursor/CC and Ni-Co@PA/CC, as shown in Figure S9 [37]. As reported, the formation of P-doped carbon were expected to improve electroconductivity and stability of catalyst, and even supply extra active sites[38,39]. The structure, crystal lattices and elements distribution of Ni-Co-precursor/CC, Ni-Co@PA/CC, and NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC were studied by transmission electron microscope (TEM) after preliminary ultrasonic treatment. Low-magnification TEM characterization exhibited that the Ni-Co-precursor/CC nanowires with the diameter of about 50 nm were successfully synthesized, as shown in Fig. 3 a. Moreover, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of as-prepared Ni-Co-precursor/CC in Fig. 3 b revealed the lattice fringes with the interplanar interval of 0.264 nm corresponding to the (221) of Co(CO3)0.5(OH)·0·.11H2O In Figure S10 a, Ni, Co, O elements of Ni-Co-precursor were distributed in the nanowire morphology, implying the Ni doped Co(CO3)0.5(OH)·0·.11H2O After chelate reaction between PA and Ni-Co-precursor/CC, the nanowires were remained, but their diameters slightly increased (Fig. 3 c). Interestingly, the HRTEM image of Ni-Co@PA/CC in Fig. 3 d indicated that the internal clear lattice fringes with the interplanar interval of 0.264 nm corresponded to the (221) plane of Co(CO3)0.5(OH)·0·.11H2O This retained crystalline phase was consistent with the XRD results in Fig. 2 e. While, the coating part with a thickness of ∼ 10 nm of nanowire was amorphous, demonstrating the chelation between Ni-Co-precursor and PA. EDX elemental mapping in Figure S10 b confirmed the successful introduction of phosphorus onto nanowires. After calcining at 450 °C, the obtained NiCo-NiCoP@PCT showed that the discrete nanoparticles with sizes of 3–10 nm were encapsulated in nanotubes with wall thickness of 3–5 nm (Fig. 3 e, f). The Fig. 3 g showed the obtained carbon shell was still amorphous. Furthermore, the HRTEM image in Fig. 3 h revealed that the nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanotubes were composed of NiCo and NiCoP, and the lattice fringes of 0.176 nm, 0.203 nm and 0.218 nm corresponded with the (200), (111) of NiCo and (111) of NiCoP, respectively. At the same time, the interfaces between the (200) and (111) of NiCo and the (111) of NiCoP were marked, confirming the formation of heterostructured NiCo-NiCoP nanoparticles. The heterostructure with unique electronic structure are beneficial to electrocatalytic reaction via minishing the tight binding of H atoms and improving the adsorption energy of H2O molecules for HER, and affording powerful hydroxyl acquisition to form high valence Ni/Co species for OER proved by previous reports[40]. In addition, EDX elemental mapping of NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC demonstrated that the P and C elements were evenly sporadic in the nanowire morphology, while Ni and Co elements were dispersive in the form of discrete particle (Fig. 3 i). The results above demonstrated that the catalyst were consisted of P-doped carbon tube and enclosed NiCo-NiCoP particles. The electrocatalytic HER performance of NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC along with CC, Ni-Co-precursor/CC, Ni-Co@PA/CC, and 20 wt% Pt/C were examined in three-electrode configuration. As shown in Fig. 4 a, the pure CC was inert for HER. The NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC exhibited the optimal HER catalytic activity with an overpotential of 135 mV to 10 mA cm−2, which was superior to Ni-Co@PA/CC (351 mV), and Ni-Co-precursor/CC (376 mV). The onset potential of NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC was about 61 mV vs RHE and greater than 20 wt% Pt/C (10 mV). However, when the potential exceed 340 mV vs RHE, the larger current density was achieved for NiCo-NiCoP@PTC/CC compared to 20 wt% Pt/C, indicating the more superior practicality of NiCo-NiCoP@PTC/CC. In addition, the HER activity of NiCo-NiCoP@PTC/CC was optimized by PA concentration and calcination temperature to determine the optimal condition of 0.6 μM PA and 450 °C, as shown in Figure S11 . The comparison of different PA concentrations under 450 °C showed that the introduction of more PA is beneficial to the HER performance while maintaining the nanowire structure. And calcination temperature mainly influenced the formation of phase and morphology of catalysts. The optimal temperature of 450 °C was beneficial to the formation NiCo and NiCoP phase for improving the intrinsic activity, and also was beneficial to the uniformity of the structure for facilitating the exposure of the active sites. Furthermore, monometallic Co-CoPx@PCT/CC and Ni-NiPx@PCT/CC were synthesized by the same method ( Figure S12,S13 ), and the morphology of Co-CoPx@PCT/CC was similar to that of NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC. However, the Co-CoPx@PCT/CC was amorphous and Ni-NiPx@PCT/CC possessed the definitive crystalline phases, which indicated that phosphating of Ni was more likely to occur. The HER activity of NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC preceded that of Ni-NiPx@PCT/CC and Co-CoPx@PCT/CC ( Figure S14 a), which manifested that the synergistic effect of bimetallic alloys and phosphates enhanced the electrocatalytic performance, as previously reported[41,42]. Moreover, the HER performance of NiCo-NiCoP@PCT preceded the numerous previously reported transition metal-based electrocatalysts in alkaline media, as displayed in Table S1 . In order to estimate the HER kinetics of the as-prepared catalysts, the Tafel plots were obtained through calculation. In Fig. 4 b, the Tafel slope of 77.79 mV dec–1 manifested the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism of HER on NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC, which was larger than 20 wt% Pt/C (43.74 mV dec–1) and significantly less than that of bare CC (415.74 mV dec–1), Ni-Co-precursor/CC (249.71 mV dec–1), and Ni-Co@PA/CC (216.15 mV dec–1). And the impedance spectroscopy (Fig. 4 c) was obtained of as-prepared electrocatalysts to further investigate the HER kinetics of the interface between electrolyte and electrode. The charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC (18.3 Ω cm−2) with the overpotential of 360 mV was less than that of CC (1582 Ω cm−2), Ni-Co-precursor/CC (234.5 Ω cm−2) and Ni-Co@PA/CC (129.6 Ω cm−2), indicating the excellent kinetics of NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC during the HER process. Furthermore, the impedance measurements of NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC at different overpotentials were performed, as shown in Figure S15 . The Rct values decreased observably from 258.8 Ω cm−2 at 160 mV to 10.06 Ω cm−2 at 460 mV along with the increased overpotentials. The double-layer capacitances of Ni-Co-precursor/CC, Ni-Co@PA/CC, and NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC were tested by cyclic voltammograms (CVs) in Figure S16 . The double-layer capacitance was linearly proportional to the electrochemical area at the solid–liquid interface[43,44]. As exhibited in Fig. 4 d, the double-layer capacitance of NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC (5.07 mF cm−2) was visibly larger than those of Ni-Co-precursor/CC (2.98 mF cm−2), and Ni-Co@PA/CC (2.33 mF cm−2). The larger double-layer capacitance corresponded to more active sites on the surface of NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC, which may be caused by the special structure of NiCo-NiCoP nanoparticles and P-doped carbon nanotube. Furthermore, after being corrected by double-layer capacitance, the NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC electrode possessed the efficient HER activity, which was much better than that of Ni-Co-precursor/CC and Ni-Co@PA/CC, implying the better intrinsic catalytic activity of NiCo-NiCoP@PTC/CC ( Figure S17 ). In order to comprehensively evaluate the catalytic performance, the long-term stability was investigated through chronoamperometric measurement. As shown in Fig. 4 e, the catalytic activity of the NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC maintained for ∼ 10 h with approximately 20 and 170 mA m−2, indicating the excellent durability for HER. On contrast, the i-t curve at same overpotential of 180 mV of 20 wt% Pt/C decline greatly, which also showed the stability advantage of the NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC. Moreover, the LSV curve and SEM image of NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC after i-t measurement at (400 mV vs. RHE showed imperceptible change in current density and morphology compared with the original state (Fig. 4 f and S18), further demonstrating the superior durability of NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC. OER with slow kinetics was replaced normally by more efficient and meaningful oxidation reaction to decrease the energy consumption of water electrolysis and optimize the hydrogen production. The comparison between FOR and OER of CC, Ni-Co-precursor/CC, Ni-Co@PA/CC, NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC, and RuO2 was carried out in the three-electrode system (Fig. 5 a). It was clear that bare CC electrodes possessed poor OER and FOR performance for the tiny current density and large potential. As for OER, the RuO2 possessed the best activity with an overpotential of 270 mV for 10 mA cm−2, preceding Ni-Co-precursor/CC (350 mV), Ni-Co@PA/CC (329 mV) and NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC (314 mV). As for FOR, the NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC exhibited the optimal FOR property, requiring merely 1.27 V vs. RHE to obtain 50 mA cm−2, which preceded Ni-Co@PA/CC (1.38 V) and Ni-Co-precursor/CC (1.64 V), implying the introduction of phosphorus was beneficial to FOR. It was more important that the FOR activity of NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC was better than that of RuO2 with a negligible current density and large potential (greater than1.55 V) for 10 mA cm−2, although RuO2 electrode showed best OER activity. The NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC possessed the much better FOR performance than OER performance, and the according potential to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2 was reduced from 1.54 V to 1.18 V vs. RHE. Further, the current densities at 1.6 V vs. RHE in Fig. 5 b confirmed the NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC possessed the best FOR activity among all samples. The corresponding current densities of CC, Ni-Co-precursor/CC, Ni-Co@PA/CC, and NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC were noticeably increased to 17, 42, 155, and 253 mA cm−2, respectively, obviously bigger than those of OER. Therefore, using the NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC as anode to replace OER with FOR was an effective and significant process for energy-saving hydrogen production of water electrolysis, meanwhile the wastewater containing HCHO was degraded by anodic oxidation. Comparison of FOR with the reported literatures were listed in Table S2 , which confirm the most excellent FOR performance of NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC. In addition, the FOR activity of NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC was superior to Ni-NiPx@PCT/CC and Co-CoPx@PCT/CC ( Figure S14 b), which manifested that the synergistic effect of bimetal Co and Ni enhanced the electrocatalytic oxidation performance, as previously reported[45]. In order to study the FOR mechanism, the CV curves of NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC anode in 1.0 M KOH with and without 14 mg mL−1 HCHO were carried out, as shown in Fig. 5 c and Figure S19 . The obvious redox peaks of CV curve in 1.0 M KOH without HCHO were attributed to the formation of Co/NiOOH and the reductive transformation from Co/NiOOH to CoII/NiII [46,47]. With the addition of HCHO, the redox peaks disappeared. But, the onset potential of FOR at around 0.3 V vs. Hg/HgO was detected, which was consistent with the initial position of the oxidation peak of CoII/NiII to CoIII/NiIII. Therefore, the FOR process was reasonably speculated as follow. First, the superficial CoII/NiII of NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC were firstly oxidized to the Co/NiOOH; Second, the HCHO were quickly oxidized by the Co/NiOOH, accompanying with corresponding reductive transformation from Co/NiOOH to CoII/NiII, which was consistent with the disappeared redox peak[21]. It means that the FOR process involves electrochemical oxidation (4 CoII/NiII + 4OH− → 4 CoIII/NiIII + 2H2O + 4e−) and chemical redox reaction (4 CoIII/NiIII + HCHO → 4 CoII/NiII + CO2 + H2O), which is summarized as HCHO + 4OH− → CO2 + 3H2O + 4e−. Hence, for the FOR applying NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC as electrocatalyst, the actual active substances were supposed to be Co/NiOOH[45]. In addition, the ex-situ XPS of NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC before and after FOR ( Figure S20 ) showed the valence variation and confirmed the formation of NiOOH and CoOOH species, which verified the catalytic active sites in FOR. Meanwhile, the XPS spectrums of C 1 s before and after FOR were consistent, indicating the stability of carbon in the catalyst, and the disappearance of the partial P 2p peaks might be caused by the electrochemical oxidation and dissolution of P to form NiOOH and CoOOH[48]. Therefore, the introduction of P benefits the FOR performance, because Ni2+ and Co2+ shift positively with the negative shift of P in XPS results which aids the formation of high valence Ni/Co species like Co/NiOOH. Besides, the current density of FOR increased with increasing addition of HCHO from 0 mg mL−1 to 12.5 mg mL−1, as shown in Fig. 5 d. The excess HCHO (14 mg mL−1) gave rise to a negligible change, possibly because the saturation or excessive adsorption of HCHO molecules on the electrode retarded the diffusion of electrolyte[49,50]. The chronoamperometry curves in Fig. 5 e revealed the quick response with adding HCHO until 14 mg mL−1 (0.46 M), and the zigzag might be caused by stir. The good linearity (R2 = 0.992) between current density and the HCHO concentrations (from 0 to 11.2 mg mL−1 or 0 to 11200 ppm) at the same potential was markedly showed in Fig. 5 f from Fig. 5 d, which could be applied to detect the wide concentration of HCHO in wastewater. Given the outstanding performance of NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC for both FOR and HER as mentioned earlier, a coupled electrolyzer system was constructed by combining the hydrogen evolution on cathode and HCHO oxidation on anode via bifunctional electrocatalyst of NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC (schematic in Fig. 6 a). As observed in Fig. 6 b, the NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC||NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC system can reach 50 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of 1.76 V (saved 320 mV) in 1.0 M KOH with 14 mg mL−1 HCHO, while a larger voltage of 2.08 V was required in 1.0 M KOH without HCHO. Figure S21 showed differences in voltage required to achieve same current density between HCHO-based and conventional water electrolysis, which likewise proved FOR optimized the electrolysis of water. Moreover, the superior catalytic properties and systems with low electrolysis voltage outperform multitudinous reported electrolyzers in alkaline media, as compared in Table S3 . In addition, the durability of the NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC||NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC was examined for 10 h in 1.0 M KOH with and without 14 mg mL−1 HCHO at an implemented voltage of 2 V, as shown in Fig. 6 c. It was obvious that there were considerable differences in current density and the retention. And as observed, the conspicuous damping in 1.0 M KOH with 14 mg mL−1 HCHO was due to the consumption of HCHO, which could be confirmed by the superior stability in 1.0 M KOH. In the inset of Fig. 6 c, when adding HCHO every half an hour in the i-t testing, a rapid ascent of current density was observed, which further indicated that NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC possessed an excellent activity and wonderful stability for FOR. And the lower maximum current density after addition was due to the high concentration of formaldehyde lead to the locally decreased PH as well as the step-down transmission dynamics[50]. Moreover, the relationship of production and HCHO degradation was explored as shown in Fig. 6 d. As observed, the amount of hydrogen production in 1.0 M KOH with HCHO was about eight times higher than that in 1.0 M KOH without HCHO, demonstrating the improvement of HER by coupling FOR. Furthermore, CH3OH was produced by hydrogenation reduction reaction of formaldehyde at the cathode, which realized the upgraded conversion of HCHO to small molecular fuel by using hydrogen sources in water. The small amount of O2 production indicated that partial OER has occurred. Besides, the continuous production of CO2 and CH3OH were simultaneously corresponded to the removal of HCHO. The above results proved the favorable coupling of HER and FOR."
9,Conclusion,"In conclusion, we manifested a controllable strategy to synthesize a heterostructural and morphologically particular NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC electrocatalyst via chelation of nanostructured metal-containing precursors with PA as well as the subsequent thermal reduction. This NiCo-NiCoP nanoparticle with sizes of 3–10 nm embedded carbon nanotube with coarse surface showed multifunctional electrocatalytic performance. First, the obtained NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC exhibited the outstanding HER electrocatalytic property with a small overpotential (10 mA cm−2) of 135 mV in 1.0 M KOH media. Second, the obtained NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC exhibited excellent activity to FOR with merely 1.31 V for 50 mA cm−2, reducing 330 mV compared to OER (1.64 V). Moreover, the upgraded conversion of HCHO to small molecular fuel of CH3OH was realized by hydrogenation reduction reaction at the cathode with hydrogen sources from water. Therefore, a two-electrode electrolyzer employing the NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC coupled on both cathode and anode merely needed 1.41 V to deliver 10 mA cm−2 and could produce same 50 mA cm−2 at lower voltage for HCHO-containing water electrolysis compared with conventional water electrolysis (decreased 320 mV). The excellent electrocatalytic activities of NiCo-NiCoP@PCT/CC could be ascribed to the synergy of PCT with the effective transmission of electron and the heterostructural NiCo-NiCoP with high intrinsic catalytic activity as well as the abundant active sites due to the special nanostructure. This work not only provided a controllable approach to synthesize 3D nanostructured metal phosphating catalyst, but also presented a new avenue to realize the combination of efficient hydrogen preparation and environmental treatment along with the electrocatalytic conversion and recycling of waste."
