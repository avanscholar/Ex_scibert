0,Introduction,"In the early 1874, the visionary writer Jules Verne predicted that “water will be the coal of the future” in his science fiction tale “The Mistery Island”. A century later, Fujishima and Honda could state in the lab the prediction made by Verne [1]. In this widely referenced experiment they showed that band gap excitation of anatase TiO2 in a photoelectrochemical cell with a Pt counter electrode and an applied bias resulted in water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen. This scientific result has becoming the inspiring step in the development of a large studied field of the photocatalysis focusing on the water splitting reaction. Although the extensive research over the years in order to refine the process, nobody has come up with a system that is both efficient and inexpensive enough to produce sufficient hydrogen to be used as a clean-burning fuel on the roads, in industry, and at home. The relevancy of this discovery is getting more evident taking into consideration the socioeconomical and environmental situation in the last decades. It is widely believed that hydrogen will play an important role in this global system since it is considered the ultimate clean energy carrier. Hydrogen can be produced from a variety of feedstocks. These include fossil resources, such as natural gas and coal, as well as renewable resources, such as biomass and water with input from renewable energy sources (e.g. sunlight, wind, wave or hydro-power). A variety of process technologies can be used, including chemical, biological, electrolytic, photolytic and thermo-chemical [2]. Each one is in a different stage of development, and offers unique opportunities, benefits and challenges. At present, H2 is mainly produced from CO and CH4 from fossil fuels by a steam reforming reaction which is accomplished by coupling with water gas shift and hydrogen purification reactions [3]. However, the forthcoming effective reduction of fossil fuel reserves as well as the serious environmental problems associated with CO2 production has inspired the development of viable alternatives. Among these, the solar photocatalytic application for hydrogen production by photoreforming in which sunlight and water are used as the hydrogen source is a highly appreciated alternative [4]. In spite of these attractive particularities, the actual hydrogen production rates are still far from a practical application status. Thus, several reported works on high scale reactors indicated that the obtained H2 productions are quite modest [5]. It is clear that the optimization of the photocatalytic system is crucial in order to make this attractive technology feasible under the industrial point of view. In this sense, Rodríguez et al. recently showed that hydrogen generated from solar sources could be competitive with that obtained from non-renewables, and point towards design strategies that can significantly aid in the reduction of solar-fuels production costs [6]. Similarly, Pinaud et al. clearly demonstrates that if technical progress is made to meet material performance targets and with appropriate plant-scale engineering, direct solar hydrogen produced by water splitting reaction can be produced at a cost which meets the US Department of Energy target threshold of $2.00–$4.00per kg H2 [7]. These authors performed an exhaustive analysis which revealed that improvement in the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (STH, which correlates the hydrogen production rate and energy of incidence solar light) of the panel-based systems could substantially drive down their costs. For a given STH of 10% and a photocatalyst lifetime of ten years, the price of hydrogen was estimated to be $1.6per kg, which could meet the mentioned target hydrogen price. In a recent perspective analysis, Domen et al. argued that due to the limitation of UV-active photocatalyst to increase the STH, it is necessary to develop and activate narrow-band-gap semiconducting photocatalysts for practical operation despite the present low activity of photocatalysts with absorption edge wavelengths longer than 600nm for the overall water-splitting reaction [8]. These authors finally conclude that photocatalytic systems must be designed bearing scalability in mind. Over the last three decades the overall photocatalytic water splitting process has been extensively studied pursuing to enhance the photoefficiency of the process [9]. However, the earliest research focused more on developing good photocatalysts than on actually understanding the process itself. Recent advances in the tailoring of new photocatalysts for solar water splitting pass through the comprehension of the band electronic structure which subsequently would lead to improvements using band engineering."
1,General considerations on H2 production reaction,"From a thermodynamic point of view the water splitting reaction is energetically unfavoured process. Thus, water transformation into H2 and O2 is an uphill reaction which needs the standard Gibbs free energy change of 237kJ/mol. 2H+ +2 e− →H2 Hydrogen evolution half reaction 2 OH− +2h+ →½ O2 +H2O Oxygen evolution half reaction H2O→H2 +½ O2 Overall water splitting The redox potentials for both reduction and oxidation processes determine the possible candidate photocatalyst by the positions of the valence and conduction bands and therefore strongly limit the range of possible photocatalysts. Both the reduction and oxidation potentials of water should lie within the band gap of the photocatalyst. Regarding to the formal electronic structure of a potential photocatalyst for H2 production, there are two important requirements to be accomplished: (i) The band gap should be 1.23eV < Eg < 3.26eV. (ii) The band positions should be located as follows: the bottom of the conduction band should be more negative than the redox potential of H+/H2 (0V vs NHE) meanwhile the top of the valence band should be more positive than the redox potential of O2/H2O (1.23V). Thus, from a thermodynamic point of view the water splitting reaction should be easily achieved using a photoinduced catalytic process involving any materials which satisfy the above conditions. However, the overall photocatalytic water splitting reaction is an endothermic reaction. This means that, in order to overcome such an energy barrier, photons of higher energy are needed. Within the great number of photoactive semiconductors proposed for water splitting ans photoreforming reactions, till now TiO2 is the most efficient one. However, the reported photonic efficiencies from solar to hydrogen by TiO2 photocatalytic water-splitting are still low. This is mainly due to the following reasons: (1) Recombination of photo-generated electron/hole pairs: conduction band electrons can recombine with valence band holes very quickly and release energy in the form of unproductive heat or photons; (2) Competitive fast backward reaction: As mentioned before the water cleavage into hydrogen and oxygen is an energy unfavoured process, thus backward reaction could easily proceeds and strongly competes with water splitting; (3) Failure to absorb visible light photons: The band gap of TiO2 is about 3.2eV and only UV light can be utilized for hydrogen production. Since the UV light only accounts for about 4% of the solar radiation energy, the efficiency of process becomes drastically low. In order to resolve the above mentioned handicaps different approaches have been proposed in the literature. Thus, the recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers has been afforded since the starting research works are mainly focused on TiO2 based catalysts [10]. Indeed, for pure TiO2, non-radiative recombination appears to be the main de-excitation channel for anatase-based nanosystems. The study of structural defects closely related to morphology variables such as size, shape, secondary particle size and porosity play a key role in controlling light-matter interactions. Hence, numerous studies have been devoted to overcome such problems, which include doping with metal or non-metal elements [11–14], controlling the structure and facets [15–17], and introducing defects into nanocrystals [18]. There are two main approaches for suppressing the reverse reaction: either the use of sacrificial reagents or the creation of a physical separation between the corresponding photoactive sites on the surface of the photocatalyst. In this sense, the separation of the photoactive sites would require surface separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes which is commonly accomplished by the use of specific co-catalyst. This point will be explicitly discussed in Section 5. As widely stated, water splitting reaction on TiO2 as model semiconductor still shows a very low efficiency. Thermodynamically, oxidation of water to produce O2 is more feasible than the formation of peroxo and hydroxyl species. However, due to the slow kinetics of the O2 evolution reaction, the formation of such alternative species appears to become kinetically competitive with O2 production. For this reason sacrificial agents such as methanol or EDTA could be used to improve hydrogen productivity. Thus the oxidation of sacrificial organic compounds by these highly reactive species would enhance the performance of the reduction half-reaction. If we consider renewable compounds as sacrificial target molecules the environmental interest of the process would be increased at the same time as efficiency. On this basis, photoreforming can be considered a more feasible process than water splitting under the thermodynamic point of view [19]. If we consider the H2 evolution half reaction by means of a photoreforming process, a generally accepted mechanism involves the oxidation of water molecules by photoinduced holes in the semiconductor. In this step, OH radicals can be produced which can attack the alcohol (acting as sacrificial agent in the oxidation half reaction) and abstract an alpha hydrogen to form a RCH2-OH radical [20]. Photoreforming was initially studied by using methanol, the simplest molecule, however in recent papers biomass derived compounds were considered, providing this process an additional interest. Thus, H2 were obtained from ethanol, [21,22]. glycerol [23,24], glucose [25,26], sucrose [27], and other biomass derived compounds [28]. In a recent paper Bahruji et al. studied in detail the H2 production reaction by photoreforming of different alcohols and proposed a chemical mechanism of H2 production reaction [29]. These authors proposed interesting rules that could govern the alcohol photoreforming reaction: (i) the alcohol must have a hydrogen in the α-position; (ii) primary alcohols undergo decarbonylation yielding a single molecule of CO2 and hydrogen plus an alkane (the exception being methanol which produces no alkane); (iii) methylene groups produced in the reaction undergo complete oxidation to yield carbon dioxide; (iv) the dominant pathway for methyl groups produced at the surface from the photo-reforming process is recombination with hydrogen and desorption. Other operational parameters such as alcohol concentration and incident light intensity have been reported to condition the progress of the reaction [30,31]. In spite of the huge amount of results concerning to the hydrogen production by photoreforming, the productivity obtained in each case is quite difficult to compare due to the high variety of operational conditions (reactor type, flows, lamp types and power,…). This fact would point out the strong necessity to standardize the results by providing the photonic efficiency."
2,Photoreforming from oxygenates,"As above pointed out, the production of hydrogen by a photoreforming process shows two clear advantages with respect to water splitting reaction. Firstly the use of sacrificial agent which could help in the reduction half-reaction and secondly the use of biomass derived substrates would provide an added-value to the overall process [32]. This coupled process represents an environmental friendly and cost effective method for wastewater treatment, with simultaneous production of energy. During photoreforming process, instead of water the organic compounds can act as scavengers of photoinduced holes and photogenerated oxygen, thereby retarding electron-hole recombination as well as hydrogen–oxygen backward reaction. This way the resulting hydrogen production rates become enhanced. As it can be expected, in this case when complete oxidation of the sacrificial agent is achieved, the rate of hydrogen production would drop to values comparable to those obtained from pure water. Within this framework, the use of biomass derived compounds such as carbohydrates is gaining increasing interest as an abundant, renewable and clean feedstock for hydrogen production [33,34]. Kawai et al. firstly demonstrated the possibility to convert carbohydrates, not only sugar or starch but also cellulose, in the presence of water and a RuO2/TiO2/Pt into hydrogen [35]. From this staring result many attempts have been reported considering different target molecules and catalysts. In this sense, as a general trend, the complex molecular structure of carbohydrates with respect to simple alcohols (methanol or ethanol) leads to a lower productivity. For this reason the mechanism of carbohydrate full degradation still need of further studies in order to be improved. Thus, Fu et al. investigated the photocatalytic reforming of glucose over different noble metal supported TiO2. They concluded that glucose molecule would be bonded to the surface undercoodinated Ti atoms through its hydroxyl groups. Once adsorbed, the glucose molecule would trap a photogenerated hole, oxidizing and forming a RCH2O radical. This radical would continue the reaction through a further attack over another glucose molecule and by a subsequent deprotonation and oxidation carboxylate species could be formed. Finally, the [R′COOH]− decarboxylates via a photo-Kolbe reaction resulting in eventual CO2. On the other hand, the H+ from glucose deprotonation will be transferred to the Pt particles and then reduced to H2 by photogenerated electrons. They also stated that the rate of hydrogen production is strongly dependent on the initial pH of the solution, reaching the maximum production at higher pH values (pH>11). Glucose shows a pKa value of ca 12.3 so when the pH is far below this point, glucose is present in its molecular form bonding to TiO2 surface by means of the hydroxyl groups. At higher pH the molecule dissociates and the anionic form of the molecule is able to capture more efficiently the photogenerated holes. At pH values higher than the pKa glucose molecule turns negatively charged as TiO2 surface hampering the adsorption and therefore the H2 evolution rate. Furthermore, the existence of α and β anomericity for saccharide molecule has also certain influence in the reaction rate probably due to the way the molecule is adsorbed at the surface [36]. Taking into account these mechanistic considerations, as expected the hydrogen production by photoreforming of mono-, di- and poly-saccharides decreased with increasing the molecular complexity [37]. Another possibility arises from the use of different oxygenated substrates non derived in this case from biomass such as waste pollutants or even methane. In the first case, the possibility of the assembly two interesting processes, hydrogen formation and pollutant degradation, appears of great relevance [38]. Thus, a wide variety of organic pollutants in water has been photoreformed achieving in all cases to complete mineralization simultaneously to the production of H2. These examples include the degradation of dyes [39], aldehydes [40], phenolic compounds [41] and even olive mill wastewater [42]. As in the case of biomass derived substrates, as the molecule is simpler the efficiency of the H2 evolution is higher. Finally the methane photoreforming has been also proved as a feasible way to produce H2 [43,44]. When Pt/TiO2 was photoirradiated in the flow of water vapour and methane around room temperature, hydrogen and carbon dioxide were the main products, and only trace amounts of ethane and carbon monoxide were also observed.43 The hydrogen production rate over Pt/NaTaO3:La was two times higher than that over Pt/TiO2 and the reaction selectively lasted for a long time without deactivation [45]."
3,Different H2 producing photocatalysts,"Since the first works describing the photocatalytic water splitting reaction the number of systems proposed has been exponentially grown [46,47]. As mentioned in the previous section, suitable materials should fit the band energy conditions in order to proceed the water oxidation and reduction reactions. Considering these electronic pre-requirements many photoactive semiconductors have been studied (Fig. 1 ). Among these TiO2, SrTiO3, and La:NaTaO3 were firstly studied though their major disadvantage is that they only absorb light in the ultraviolet region of the solar spectrum [48,49]. However, in spite of the large number of the proposed systems, only a few actually show an appreciable activity for water photolysis. Recently, other UV-active systems such as Nb- and Ta-based oxides have been also considered for this reaction [50]. In this sense, in a recent paper, Soldat et al. proposed new types of BaTaO3 system prepared by a citrate route. The obtained photocatalysts showed interesting hydrogen production rates associated to the improved charge carrier separation [51]. In the last years most relevant results regarding such systems are related to TiO2 based photocatalysts. In this case the research has been focused in the structural and morphological modification of TiO2, the development of two or more components photocatalyst that are more complicated than TiO2 or its the combination with a wide range of possible co-catalysts. Thus, it has been reported that the particular morphology of TiO2 could have a notable effect on the H2 production (Fig. 2 ) [52]. Teng et al. argued that owing to the higher surface energy of the {001} TiO2 facets, nanosheet-based photocatalyst shows higher hydrogen production activity and recyclability than the nanorod-based one. In the same direction, Wang et al. also pointed out that hierarchical anatase TiO2 nanoflowers consisting of {001} facet dominating nanosheets shows improved photocatalytic H2 evolution [53]. The coexistence of different exposed planes could promote electron transfer from {001} to {010} when they are photoexcited enhancing the photoexcited carrier lifetimes which is closely linked to the number of {001}–{010} quasi-heterojunctions. Similarly, Wang et al. also showed that the preparation of TiO2 particles with a high percentage of reactive facets (∼85%) leads to 1.4–5 times higher performance than their counterparts in photocatalytic hydrogen production [54]. On the contrary, Gordon et al. proposed exactly the opposed trend [55]. These authors argued that the photocatalytic activities of oxygen deficient anatase Pt-TiO2 showing preferentially {101} facet exposed are more active for the production of hydrogen from methanolic solutions under solar illumination. Therefore the control of the reactive facet of TiO2 has clearly turned as a promising strategy for increasing the hydrogen production that needs further studies. Besides these specific studies concerning to the exposed facets, the origin of the intrinsic photoactivity for hydrogen production related to the structural and/or morphological features of TiO2 is still not clear enough. In a recent paper, Montes-Navajas et al. tried propose a correlation between the structural and morphological features of different bare commercial TiO2 (without any supported co-catalyst) [56]. Unfortunately, from their results it was possible to conclude that upon solar irradiation the photocatalytic activity tendency appears difficult to rationalize. These authors found that it was not possible to correlate well with crystallographic phases present and it seems to derive from more complex interplay of different factors such as the presence of impurities, surface area, degree of crystallinity, particle size and morphology. Thus, from all the TiO2 samples studied it results that Evonik P25 showed the best H2 production. In this sense, Obregón et al. recently point out the strong influence of structural and morphological features of TiO2 on the Cu active sites with the hydrogen evolution production [57]. In spite of the complexity in certain cases, heterostructured systems provide an attractive and flexible approach for enhancing the reaction efficiency. Two or more semiconductors coupling with the appropriate electronic band positions would lead to a more efficient separation of the photoinduced charge carriers [58–60]. As discussed in the previous section, for the particular case of H2 production through proton reduction, the studied systems must have conduction band levels sufficiently higher than the H+/H2 redox potential. Following this approach different heterojunctions based on TiO2 coupled with other semiconductors such as CdS [61–63], ZnO [64], SnO2 [65], WO3 [66], Bi2O3 [67], Fe2O3 [68], ZrO2 [69,70], MoO3 [71], g-C3N4 [72,73] or graphene [74,75] to form heterojunctions. Among these proposed composite systems CdS decorated TiO2 have received considerable attention due to the appropriate band alignment which leads to a highly efficient electron transfer. In this sense Fang et al. proposed a ternary design in which a transfer path for the photoexcited electrons of CdS to the core Au particles via the TiO2 nanocrystal bridge effectively suppresses the electron-hole recombination on the CdS photocatalyst [62]. Similarly, Zhou et al. proposed different CdS/M/TiO2 (M =Au, Ag, Pt, Pd) ternary heterojunctions for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution [76] Furthermore the different band structure of TiO2 polymorphs has been also used, in this case for homojunction formations, showing enhanced charge separation (Fig. 3 ). Thus, anatase-rutile and anatase-brookite heterostructures has been reported to exhibit better H2production with respect to the single TiO2 catalysts [77–82]. Indeed, by choosing the adequate anatase-rutile fraction and modification of in the TiO2 it is possible not only to enhance the reaction rate but also supress the CO production during photoreforming reaction [83]. This selectivity improving could be caused by the modification of the surface acidity/basicity features of the homojunction. Therefore the control of this simple homojunction would provide interesting additional benefits to hydrogen production reaction. Besides traditional oxide photocatalysts mostly based on TiO2 systems different alternatives have been studied. Thus, for the sake to propose alternative materials able to use the visible region of the solar spectrum other systems like (Ga1−x Zn x )(N1−x O x ) [84], Fe2O3 [85], WO3 [86,87], CdS and g-C3N4 [88,89] have been explored as potential photocatalysts. In this sense, (Ga1−x Zn x )(N1−x O x ) system has been extensively studied by Domen’s group for the overall water splitting reaction [90,91]. This solid solution alone shows a scarce photoactivity, however when it is loaded with a specific co-catalysts the reaction proceeds with a high hydrogen yield [92]. By the moment, this system loaded with Rh2−y Cr y O3 co-catalyst shows the best visible light photocatalyst for water splitting, reaching a quantum efficiency of 5.6% under visible light irradiation (Fig. 4 ) [93,94]. Among the new photocatalysts for hydrogen production recently proposed in the literature, perhaps the most interesting ones are metal sulphides and graphitic carbon nitride. This particular interest is based in their notably photoactivity under visible light irradiation. The origin of the visible photoactivity of metal sulphides can be attributed to the participation of S 3p orbitals (being more negative than O 2p) on the construction of the valence band, which increase the width of the band itself. Therefore, in contrast to metal oxides many of them (CdS, MoS, AgS) exhibit a narrow band gap. In spite of their remarkable visible photoactivity, there exists an inherent drawback, i.e., photocorrosion in which chalcogenide itself could be oxidized by the photogenerated holes [95]. Among the available sulphides, CdS with band gap of 2.4eV is probably the best-studied metal sulphide photocatalyst for hydrogen production reaction, although its high toxicity upon photocorrosion. Such problem greatly obstructs its practical application due firstly to the loss of activity and more importantly to the metal leakage pollution (particularly serious in the case of cadmium) produced during the reaction. It is believed that photocorrosion occurs in these chalcogenide photocatalysts when their activity irreversibly decreases even with the re-addition of sacrificial agent. Various efforts have been made to improve the stability of sulphide-based photocatalysts and retain its high photoactivity. The use of specific sacrificial reagent which would hinder the sulphide photocorrosion process is widely reported as a first attempt to stabilize the sulphide structure against photocorrosion. Thus, S2−, SO4 2− or S2O3 2− species have been extensively used as sacrificial hole scavenger [46]. In the presence of such species, chalcogenides show a remarkable photoactivity for water reduction. Regarding to the photocatalytic systems, the proposed approaches passed through the coupling sulphides with wide-bandgap semiconductor or oxidation co-catalyst [96], and constructing a solid solution [97–99], complex core–shell [100] or shelter [101] heterostructures which could protect the unstable semiconductor inside the core. An exotic example of the preparation of complex heterostructures is reported by Hu et al. [102] These authors described a series of multi-heterostructured metal chalcogenides (CdS-Te, NiS/CdS-Te, and MoS2/CdS-Te) with a surprising shish-kebab-like morphology synthesized by a microwave-assisted pyrolysis of dithiocarbamate precursors (Fig. 5 ). CdS-Te and CdS-Te-based composites exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity and photostability for water splitting into H2. In recent years, a considerable attention has been paid to CuInS2 due to its environmentally benign metal components with respect to CdS based photocatalysts and excellent solar-harvesting properties. CuInS2 is a direct bandgap (∼1.5eV) semiconductor which has a large optical absorption coefficient (>105 cm−1) and is considered a promising semiconductor for photovoltaic devices and other optoelectronic applications [103]. As in the case of CdS different heterostructured systems complex have been reported in the last years in order to enhance its photocatalytic performance [104,105]. As an example, a complex ternary solid solution formed by AgInS2-CuInS2-ZnS was proposed by Tsuji et al . some years ago [106]. Then, other solid solutions based on CuInS2 have been reported. Thus, Ren et al . described the preparation of a (CuIn) x Cd2(1−x)S2 solid solution by a hydrothermal method [107]. Loading of Pt as co-catalyst results in a substantial improvement in H2 evolution (2456μmol/h·g) with respect to Pt-loaded pure CdS (40.2 μmol/h·g). Moreover, these authors reported that the activity of this system shows a high stability in the photocatalytic process after long use experiments. Considering the high number of research works publish in the last years, the second promising candidate for hydrogen production reaction is g-C3N4 [108]. Thus a high variety of complex systems have been proposed for the optimization of its photocatalytic performance. These approaches passed through the formation of surface coupling hybridization with other semiconductors (such as TiO2 [109], SnO2 [110], CdS [111], or graphene [112]), construction of mesoporous structures [113], doping with metal (Fe, Ag, Au, Pd) or non-metal species (S, B and P) or sensitizing with organic dyes [114]. Thus, although the intrinsic photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 itself can be considered low, the control of the synthetic parameters as well as the designing of complex heterostructures leads in most of the cases to a notably photoactivity compared to the former components. In this sense, Wu et al. reported that the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 is strongly related to the presence of structural defects generated during the calcination process. These defects produce additional optical absorption in the visible spectra of g-C3N4 and weakened photoluminescence [115]. These authors demonstrated that the structural control could have a strong impact on the final hydrogen production of g-C3N4 (Fig. 6 ). The photoactivity enhancement could also be achieved by the formation of heterostructure systems. By coupling process, g-C3N4 based heterostructures can be formed by combining with visible light active semiconductor materials (such as CdS, Bi2WO3, and BiOI), leading to a more efficient photogenerated charge separation if the band diagram of both fit adequately. In addition, it can combine with large band gap photocatalysts (such as TiO2, ZnO, and ZnWO4), which can largely broaden the application of the g-C3N4 based nanocomposites (Fig. 7 )."
4,The co-catalyst factor,"As discussed in Section 2, in order to achieve a large-scale and sustainable hydrogen production process from water, the photocatalytic system usually requires a high efficient photocatalyst. Therefore, most of the proposed photocatalyst are oxide type exhibiting an n-type character. That means that upon excitation, they would readily accumulate excited holes on their surfaces showing high oxygen evolution activity. In this case, the counterpart excited electrons would prefer to stay in the bulk of the semiconductor; as a result, metal nanoparticles can often effectively transport such electrons to the surface by guiding them along the metal–semiconductor interface [116]. Thus, the participation of a co-catalyst has been extensively considered for the hydrogen production reaction which could improve either reduction or oxidation half-reactions (Fig. 8 ) [117,118]. Although along this section we will focus our attention to reduction co-catalyst due the great impact in the H2 production reaction, it can be highlighted that for O2 evolution reaction several co-catalysts (such as MnOx, IrOx, CoOx or CoPi) have been also proposed [72,117,119]. As mentioned, practically the whole studied photocatalytic systems need a high-active co-catalyst for reducing the overpotential of proton reduction and enhancing hydrogen evolution efficiency. For the wide number of metal co-catalysts discussed, different roles have been proposed in the literature which tried to explain the function of such co-catalysts in the reaction. The first role invoked concerns to the improvement of the electron-hole lifetime by trapping of photogenerated travelling electrons. Another possibility argued is related to its participation in the reaction of the organic with the surface, usually through dehydrogenation/decarbonylation reactions [120]. Even more, Joo et al. recently proposed an alternative striking pathway that does not involve electron transfer to the metal but requires the metal co-catalyst to act as a catalyst for the recombination of the hydrogen atoms made via the reduction of protons on the surface of the semiconductor instead [121]. Till now this task assumed for reduction co-catalysts has been reasonably accomplished by noble metals (Pt, Au, Ag or Pd). The most accepted mechanism explaining the interaction between the metal and the active semiconductor involves the creation of a Schottky barrier that would inject electrons from the semiconductor conduction band toward the metal Fermi level [122]. By driving the photogenerated electrons to the metal active sites they serve as cathodic centers for H2 production. This leads to the increase in the electron transfer rate to the adsorbed species, retarding the possibility of their recombination with holes. Noble metals generally show a more stable metallic state which would prevent its oxidation during water splitting reaction making them useful as active co-catalysts. The main drawback for a widespread use is their scarcity and the subsequent high price of them. For this reason, alternative transition metal co-catalysts such as Cu, Ni or Fe have been widely proposed [123]. However, metals in an oxidised state are expected to follow a different electron transfer mechanism due to the loss of metallic properties. Moreover, in recent papers it has been proposed transition sulphides such as CuS [124], NiS [125] or MoS [126] as effective hydrogen production co-catalysts. However, as it was stated previously such candidates suffer drastic anodic photocorrosion processes and trend to form S or sulfate [127]. Finally, the last approach to novel co-catalyst systems consist on bimetallic formulations by mixing different noble metals or noble-transition metals. In the following sub-sections we will describe in more details the results obtained by noble metal and transition metal based co-catalysts."
5,Noble metal based co-catalysts,"5.1 Noble metal based co-catalysts As it was mentioned before, the occurrence of dispersed metal particles on the semiconductor catalyst would increase the electron transfer to the adsorbed species and therefore enhance the efficiency of the process. This point is of great relevance for the photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction. Historically, the traditional metal co-catalysts used were based on noble metal particles [128]. On the basis of the large literature describing the parameters that would govern the co-catalysts efficiency, a clear view of their role is still limited. As pointed out by Yoshida et al. the efficiency of different noble metal co-catalysts can be related to the work function of each one [32]. In principle, the work function of each metal should then play a role in the formation of Schottky barrier. Taking into account this consideration, Pt appears as the most active noble metal for hydrogen generation. In spite of this general conclusion, the final hydrogen production efficiency is strongly dependent not only on the type of metal co-catalyst but also on its nature and concentration [129]. In this sense, the preparation procedure used for the metal decoration could have great influence on its final photocatalytic performance. In fact, even when we use the same metal, the deposition method clearly affects to the photoactivity [130,131]. As a general trend, the specific morphology (dispersion and metal particle size) and oxidation state appears as the key parameters which would condition the photocatalytic activity. Thus, Navarro et al. stated that for particles in the metallic oxidation state the morphology does not have a relevant influence indicating that the active site would be located in the metal-semiconductor interface [131]. On the contrary, for partial oxidised metal particles it has been observed improved photoactivities probably due to better e− conductivity of the partially charged Pt particles that may enhance the trapping electrons and thereby extending the electron/hole carriers separation. In a recent paper Luo et al. stablished an interesting correlation between electrocatalysis and photocatalysis by noble metal based materials [132]. Thus, since in electrodes for electrocatalytic applications the size and shape of noble metal arise as a crucial parameter to be controlled, they proposed the same condition for photocatalytic materials. These authors argued that conventional deposition methods (photodeposition or impregnation methods) do not allow controlling such morphological parameters. Thus, they obtained nano-cubic and nano-spherical Pt particles prepared via a shape-and-size-controlled synthesis and loaded onto a CdS semiconductor. They finally stated that for both morphologies cluster size is the determining parameter, being the shape effect more significant for larger Pt particles than for smaller particles. In the same line, Xing et al. have synthesized isolated metal atoms (Pt, Pd, Rh, or Ru) stably by anchoring on TiO2 by a facile one-step method [133]. Such isolated metal atom based photocatalysts show excellent stability for H2 evolution being 6–13-fold more photoactive than the metal clusters loaded on TiO2 by the traditional method. In this sense, Schweinberger et al. proposed a successful method for preparing Pt clusters smaller than 2nm supported on CdS surface by means of laser ablation [134]. These authors found that the maximum hydrogen production rate was achieved by Pt46 cluster and described a clear size effect within the studied sizes. Moreover, such size effect has been interpreted by considering two electron transfer steps: first from the semiconductor to the cluster and second from the cluster to the hydrogen atom. In a recent paper, Li et al. incorporated the metal particle localization on the support as a crucial parameter to be considered [135]. Thus, when PtO clusters co-catalyst is located on the (001) face of TiO2 the H2 production rate observed was higher. This fact has been related to shorter migration path of the photogenerated electrons compared with Pt at (001) face. This would result in a rapid capture of photogenerated electrons by metallic clusters and their avoiding electron/hole recombination. In the case of gold, it is clear that deposition method affects in a greater extent to the morphological features of the metal deposits [136]. It is widely reported that gold deposition method difficulty leads to small size and narrow distribution gold particles, especially when compared to platinum [137]. As mentioned before, the greater ability of Pt with respect to Au to act as electron sink and would be linked to the difference between their respective work functions. This effect may be also associated to the smaller size of Pt nanoparticles with respect to Au ones. Furtherly, in addition to the particular metal morphological aspects the interface contact with the support would be also of great importance. Thus, Jovic et al. described that the creation of highly active three phase interfacial sites “hot-spots” formed by the intimate contact of Au nanoparticles with anatase and rutile would lead to enhanced photoactivity [138]. A further aspect to be considered for gold and also silver based co-catalysts concerns the possibility of visible photoactivity through their plasmon excitation (Fig. 9 ) [139,140]. It has been reported that the localized surface plasmon (LSP) has important applications in photocatalysis. This is mainly due to the following aspects: (i) direct injection of energetic electrons to semiconductors, resembling dye sensitizations [141]; (ii) enhancement of electron–hole pairs generation in the regions of semiconductor in vicinity to the metal nanoparticles, due to amplified near-field electromagnetic field and resonant photon scattering, i.e. via resonant energy transfer (RET) [142]. Within this excitation mode, the electronic mechanism and reaction scheme drastically change (Fig. 9). Upon visible light irradiation TiO2 is totally inactive and the Au NPs would act preferentially as light harvesters injecting hot electrons into the conduction band of TiO2 promoting water reduction to H2. Considering this role of light harvester, high visible light absorption by gold might be the control parameter for the overall photocatalytic efficiency. In this case, contrary to UV-irradiation conditions, the Au particle size would not play a key role in the photocatalytic activity [143]. This reverse electronic mechanism would imply that the reduction site would be placed at TiO2 and the oxidation site on the metal nanoparticle. Recently, Kowalska et al. reported the action spectra for different Au-TiO2 systems with varying gold and TiO2 sizes for the isopropanol oxidation reaction [144]. They demonstrated that under plasmonic excitation a direct relationship between the gold size with the photocatalytic activity can be established. Thus, under visible irradiation, the greater the gold particle size (e.g., broader particle size distribution with larger mean and higher moments, particularly the variance), the higher the efficiency exhibited due to the larger number of photons absorbed. As above pointed out, the higher performance observed in this case would be related to the extended plasmonic effect observed on large particles. On the contrary, under UV conditions, smaller gold particles clearly produce higher photoactivities. Very recently, suggested that the co-existence of large (>10nm) and small (<5nm) Au nanoparticles in Au-TiO2 catalysis prepared by multistep photodeposition method contributed to stronger SPR photoabsorption, enhanced H2 evolution rate from 2-propanol in aqueous suspensions under visible light irradiation. In these cases, smaller Au nanoparticles acted as a reduction site for H2 evolution. Similarly, silver showing a slightly lower work function than Pt or Au has been used as a suitable co-catalyst for H2 production reaction.32 However, probably due to the lower photoactivities obtained the number of published papers is scarce."
6,Non-noble metal co-catalysts,"5.2 Non-noble metal co-catalysts As it has been discussed in the previous section, platinum has been frequently used onto semiconductor surfaces as a co-catalyst. However, if we pursue a scaling up production for water splitting-hydrogen generation, the use of any platinum-based (or in general noble metal based) material is quite questionable due to the scarcity of this noble metal on the Earth’s crust which lead to an important economic problem. In this sense recent important advances have been achieved in the direction of mimicking the catalytic active sites of natural hydrogenases which are based on earth-abundant elements such as Cu, Fe, Co, Ni [145–150]. Among these transition metal co-catalysts and although the reported rates till now are still far from those obtained for noble metals, copper based catalysts appear as a promising candidate [151]. In spite of the great number of papers dedicated to the study of Cu-based photocatalysts for hydrogen generation, the nature of the active copper species (Cu2O or CuO) and other external factors governing its photoactivity is less understood [152]. As already mentioned, the oxidised state of transition metal co-catalysts makes a difference with respect to noble metal ones and includes an additional parameter to be considered. Thus, within the discussion about the copper active species, some authors claimed that Cu2O species are responsible for the photoactivity for H2 generation from water reduction [153]. Thus, Xi et al. correlated the presence of easily reducible Cu2O species toward metallic Cu during the H2 production reaction with the improved photocatalytic activity. Similarly, Jung et al. associated the higher photoactivity of Cu-TiO2 systems to the dispersion and reducibility of CuOx (Cu+/Cu0) species [154]. On the other hand, other authors argued that the presence of CuO would be responsible for the enhanced separation of photoinduced electrons and holes [155]. In the same direction, Ampelli et al. reported the improving effect of Cu2+ incorporation into the TiO2 structure and the simultaneous creation of oxygen vacancies [147]. Thus, embedded CuOx@TiO2 systems showed higher photocatalytic performances with respect to impregnated samples [156]. Within this context, Korzhak et al. investigated the relationships between the quantum efficiencies of the photocatalytic hydrogen production and the textural characteristics of a Cu-doped TiO2 system [157]. In this case the photoactivity was correlated to the Cu nanostructure obtained and especially with deterioration of the electronic interactions between the components of metal−semiconductor composites with growth of the metal nanoparticles size. On this basis, the interaction with TiO2 is expected to stabilize the copper oxides against photocorrosion and could enhance the activity by a most efficient process. Thus, well dispersed CuOx nanoparticles would be easily reduced during the reaction forming well dispersed copper metal particles which would favour electron trapping. Recently, Valero et al. prepared two set of Cu-TiO2 systems by means of different deposition methods [158]. They proposed that easily reduced Cu2+ species obtained preferentially by chemical reduction method could be the responsible of the higher photoactivity of Cu-TiO2 (Fig. 10 ). Moreover, the final metal cluster size, dispersion and oxidation state could be strongly influenced by the structural and surface support features [57]. Although Ni-TiO2 system has been also proven to be an alternative candidate to noble metal co-catalyst systems little investigation in relation to photocatalytic H2 production can be found in the literature. As in the case of copper based systems, confusion exists as to whether NiO or Ni is the active co-catalyst species [159,160] In a recent paper, Chen et al. presented interesting experimental evidences suggesting that highly dispersed metallic Ni (∼1 nm sized clusters) would be the active co-catalyst species [161]. Moreover, the 0.5 wt.% Ni/TiO2 photocatalyst showed superior activity to a 2wt.% Au/TiO2 reference photocatalyst."
7,Bimetallic co-catalysts,"5.3 Bimetallic co-catalysts As afore mentioned, in a metal-semiconductor configuration the excited electrons need overcome the Schottky in order to be transferred from the semiconductor to the deposited metal. Thus the height of the Schottky barrier would determine the efficiency of electron transfer. The extent of the Schottky barrier is directly related to the work function of metal as well as the conduction band electron affinity of the semiconductor. Taking into consideration this premise the work function of the metal could be tuned by the introduction of another metal with different work function [162]. The formation of a bimetallic co-catalyst has been proposed to promote the photocatalytic activity of the TiO2-based photocatalytic system instead of their monometallic counterparts. Several examples of this approach have recently appeared in the literature considering noble metal and transition metal homo- and heterojunction. As monometallic co-catalyst platinum has been extensively used since it shows the higher photocatalytic performance for hydrogen production. However different bimetallic formulations have been proposed denoting the wide field to be explored. Thus, bimetallic Pt-Au [163,164] or Pt-Ag [165,166] have been recently proposed for the hydrogen production reaction showing improved photoactivities with respect to the monometallic co-catalyst (Fig. 11 ). It is clear that noble metals are expensive and rare candidates to be used even in low loading percentage, making their practical use certainly doubtful. The development of alternative noble metals-free substitutes have been discussed in the previous section pointing out copper and nickel as promising alternative to Pt. Upon this consideration, it can be deduced that the Cu–Ni bimetallic co-catalyst might have an expected better performance due to the synergy between both metals [167]. The study of these heterostructured co-catalysts in different configurations (core-shell, alloys) is opening new possibilities in the development of highly efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen generation. On the basis of all the above discussion reported in the literature it is clear that different parameters could strongly determine the role of co-catalyst in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. Thus, factors such as the loading amount, the dispersion and size of co-catalyst metal particles have considerable influence on the photocatalytic activity. These points would suggest that in addition to the electrocatalytic activity of surface redox reactions, electronic interaction at the co-catalyst-semiconductor interface is crucial."
8,Conclusion,"From the huge number of contributions published in the last years it is clear that the photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction from water is an attractive reaction. The potential conversion of solar energy and renewable resources (such as alcohols or biomass derivatives) into valuable fuels by photoreforming process is undoubtedly not only attractive but also very necessary under the point of view of the global sustainability. However, much heavier efforts are needed to understand the behaviour of complex molecules such as carbohydrates. As it can be envisaged along this short overview the development of highly efficient photocatalytic material is by the moment a crucial task that might be strongly reinforced. On one hand the investigation of highly active semiconductors or heterostructured systems that could (i) use as much as possible the solar radiation and (ii) optimize the electronic mechanism of photogenerated pairs separation. Secondly the incorporation of efficient reduction (and even oxidation co-catalysts, only slightly mentioned in this review) co-catalysts economically suitable for this application that could enhance the photocatalytic efficiency by improving the charge transfer to adsorbates. By now, the low quantum efficiencies reported and the absence of adequate scaling-up studies, lead to practical lack of industrial application. Unfortunately, we have to admit that Verne's prediction of a “solar fuels” industry from water is still no more than a futuristic concept. For this reason the development of a suitable photocatalyst is extremely decisive and might encourage us to emphasize our efforts for this scope."
