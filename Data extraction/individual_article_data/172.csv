0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) is widely considered to be the clean energy vector of the future, with the gradual transition from a fossil fuel economy to a hydrogen economy expected to take place over the next decade. This transition demands low cost and environmentally friendly methods for H2 production, distribution and storage, with the former arguably the greatest obstacle to the development of a sustainable hydrogen economy [1–3]. Currently, H2 is produced industrially via steam methane reforming (SMR) followed by the water/gas shift reaction (WGSR) when necessary [2,4,5]. Both are energy intensive technologies with a significant carbon footprint. Amongst the various alternative technologies that have been proposed for future hydrogen production, water-splitting and alcohol-photoreforming using sunlight and semiconductor photocatalysts represent two of the more promising pathways. Over the past decade, an enormous amount of research effort has been directed towards the development and optimization of semiconductor photocatalysts for solar hydrogen production, with M/TiO2 photocatalysts (M = Pd, Pt or Au) dominating this research space due to their high activity and photo-corrosion resistance [6–14]. A wide range of semiconductor materials have been studied in relation to H2 production from water or biofuels under UV or solar excitation. TiO2 (Eg = 3.0–3.3 eV, depending on the polymorph) is the most studied of these semiconductors and is considered the archetypal photocatalyst in most applications [15,16]. Absorption of electromagnetic radiation with E > Eg generates electron-hole pairs (e− – h+), which either recombine or migrate to the surface of TiO2 particles to drive redox reactions. Bare TiO2 surfaces (and most other semiconductors) are ineffective for generating H2, due to the rapid electron-hole pair recombination and the large overpotential for H2 evolution on bare titania surfaces [17,18]. Surface modification of TiO2 with high workfunction metal co-catalysts (e.g. especially Pd, Pt and Au) [11–14,17–21] or creating junctions with other semiconductors (e.g. Cu2O, CuO) [3,22–24] are effective in promoting H2 evolution by suppressing electron-hole pair recombination (increasing the availability of charge carriers) and also creating cathodic sites for H2 evolution. These high work function metals (Pd ɸ = 5.6 eV, Pt ɸ = 5.7 eV and Au ɸ = 5.3–5.6 eV) form Schottky junctions with TiO2 [25,26], readily accepting electrons from the conduction band of TiO2 to reduce hydrogen ions to molecular hydrogen. The Fermi level of these metal co-catalysts is ideally located between bottom of TiO2 conduction band and the H2O/H2 redox couple, allowing facile transfer of electrons from TiO2 to the metal co-catalysts and subsequently to aqueous protons in solution. Because of the diffuse nature of sunlight, H2 production rates for even the most active of photocatalysts are considerably lower than those of current SMR/WGSR technologies, therefore requiring a larger amount of catalyst to achieve meaningful H2 production rates. Amongst the alternatives to expensive platinum group metal co-catalysts (Pd, Pt and Au), metallic nickel (Ni) is the most logical candidate, since Ni is cheap, abundant and similarly has a high work function (Ni ɸ = 5.3 eV) [25–27]. Relative to M/TiO2 systems (Pd, Pt and Au), knowledge of Ni/TiO2 photocatalysts and their potential for solar H2 production lags far behind, motivating further investigations. Work to date on Ni/TiO2 systems has been hampered by uncertainty about the exact nature of the dispersed Ni-related species on TiO2 responsible for promoting H2 evolution (e.g. NiO [28–34], Ni [27,35–38] or NiNiO [13,39,40]. Table 1 summarises literature on Ni/TiO2 semiconductor photocatalysts for H2 production. Fan et al. reported that NiO/TiO2 interfaces form effective p-n heterojunctions which facilitate H2 evolution under UV excitation by acting as electron-trapping sites [28]. TiO2 is an intrinsic n-type semiconductor due to lattice oxygen vacancies, whereas NiO is a wide band gap p-type semiconductor (Eg = 3.6–4.0 eV) [41,42] After photoexcitation of TiO2, it was proposed that photoexcited electrons will migrate to NiO, which acts as the proton reduction site. Other groups have suggested that Ni/NiO core/shell structures can activate TiO2 for H2 evolution [13,39,40]. Bahruji et al. found that NiNiO/TiO2 photocatalysts yielded better photocatalytic activity compared to NiO/TiO2 photocatalysts under the same testing conditions [13]. Recently, Chen et al. conducted a detailed study of Ni/TiO2 photocatalysts for H2 production in ethanol-water mixtures under UV excitation [27]. It was determined by XPS, Ni K-edge and Ni L-edge XANES that Ni0 was the dominant nickel species on the surface of the Ni/TiO2 photocatalysts, with the optimal Ni loading for hydrogen production being 0.5 wt%. Indeed, the 0.5 wt% Ni/TiO2 photocatalyst prepared using Degussa P25 (85 wt% anatase + 15 wt% rutile) demonstrated superior photocatalytic activity to a 2 wt% Au/P25 TiO2 reference photocatalyst (2 wt% is the optimal co-catalyst loading for Au on TiO2) at low ethanol concentrations (<10 vol%). Chen et al. also tested NiO/TiO2 photocatalysts in ethanol-water mixtures under UV [27], but these showed negligible initial activity and a long induction period before H2 evolution commenced, suggesting that reduction of NiO to Ni0 via electron transfer from the TiO2 conduction band occurred during UV irradiation. It should be noted that H2 production rates reported by Chen et al. were up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than in other literature studies (∼10–20 mmol g−1h−1 depending on the ethanol concentration), which suggests the need for caution and the requirement for further studies to confirm the high rates achieved. Further characterisation studies are also needed to confirm Ni0 as the active co-catalyst species. The addition of sacrificial hole scavengers such as methanol or ethanol is a commonly used practice in semiconductor photocatalysis to facilitate electron-hole pair separation following photoexcitation. The sacrificial hole scavengers act as electron donors and are progressively oxidised by valence band holes at the photocatalyst surface (e.g. CH3OH + 2 h+ → HCHO + 2H+; HCHO + H2O + 2 h+ → HCOOH + 2H+; HCOOH + 2 h+ → CO2 + 2H+), serving also as additional proton sources for generating H2 [20,21,43–47]. The oxidation potentials for alcohol photoreforming are much lower than that of water (c.f. CH3OH + H2O + 6 h+ → CO2 + 6H+, 0.03 V versus NHE; CH3CH2OH + 3H2O + 12 h+ → 2CO2 + 12H+, 0.08 V versus NHE; H2O → H2 + 1/2O2, 1.23 V versus NHE) [48]. Due to the relative ease of alcohol oxidation, and the suppression of electron-hole pair recombination in the semiconductor in the presence of the alcohol, photocatalytic H2 production rates in alcohol-water mixtures are typically 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than those achieved in pure water. During alcohol photoreforming, the dominant pathway is alcohol oxidation to an alpha hydroxy radical, followed by subsequent oxidation of the alpha hydroxy radical to the aldehyde, followed by slower oxidation or photoreforming of the aldehyde, processes which eventually lead to acids, CO2, CO, CH4 and various other hydrocarbon products depending on the alcohol. Alcohol photo-oxidation and photoreforming pathways are complex, especially for triols such as glycerol. H2 production rates are strongly dependent on the hole scavenger used [11–14,18,20,27,49–52]. Bowker et al. investigated the Au/P25 TiO2 system under UV, and found that H2 production rates decreased in the order methanol > 1-propanol > ethanol > 1-butanol > 2-propanol ≫ tertiary butanol at a fixed alcohol concentration of 0.1 vol% [11]. Bahruji et al. conducted a detailed study of the Pd/P25 TiO2 system under UV using 20 different sacrificial reagents, and established the reactivity order triols > diols > 2° alcohols > 1° alcohols > 3° alcohols again at a 0.1 vol% alcohol concentration [49]. Yang et al. studied H2 production from pure alcohols over a 1 wt% Pt/anatase photocatalyst, and observed that rates decreased in the order methanol ≈ ethanol > 1-propanol ≈ 2-propanol > 1-butanol [14]. These studies have attempted to correlate hydrogen production rates with specific properties of the alcohol, such as structure, polarity, polarizability and alcohol oxidation potential [14,21]. These works provide a reasonable guide as to the general reactivity pattern followed by M/TiO2 photocatalysts at a few specific alcohol concentrations. What is not clear in current literature is the influence of alcohol concentration on photocatalytic hydrogen production rates in M/TiO2 systems (the vast majority of studies reported to date have used a single alcohol concentration, typically 0.1–10 vol%). Only a few studies have probed the effect of alcohol concentration in detail [27,53–62]. Wu et al. reported efficient hydrogen production from aqueous methanol-water mixtures containing Au/TiO2 photocatalysts under UV irradiation [53]. The optimal methanol concentration was 5 M methanol, yielding a H2 production rate of ∼3.333 mmol g−1 h−1. Stelmachowski et al. examined a wide range of TiO2-based photocatalysts (co-catalysts = W, Mn, Cr, Ni, Co, Pt, Pd, Au and Ag) in aqueous glycerol solutions [54]. The highest H2 production rate achieved was 24.2 mmol g−1h−1 for a 0.042 wt% Pt/TiO2 at a glycerol concentration of 4.5 wt%. Daskalaki et al. conducted a systemic study of Pt/TiO2 in glycerol-water mixtures [56]. The optimum reaction conditions were 0.1–0.5 wt% Pt and a glycerol concentration of 1 M. Sadanandam et al. studied H2 production from a 1 wt% Co/TiO2 photocatalyst in a range of glycerol-water mixtures (1–20 vol%) under UV excitation, reporting an optimum H2 production rate of 11 mmol g−1 h−1 in 5 vol% glycerol-water mixtures [60]. Recently, Chen et al. compared the photocatalytic activity of 0.5 wt% Ni/TiO2 and 2 wt% Au/TiO2 photocatalysts in a wide range of ethanol-water mixtures (0–100 vol% alcohol) under UV irradiation [27]. The optimal ethanol concentration was 95 vol% for Ni/TiO2 (rate = 24.3 mmol g−1 h−1) and 80 vol% for Au/TiO2 (rate = 32.4 mmol g−1 h−1). To our knowledge, no study has yet been reported comparing the performance of different M/TiO2 photocatalysts in different alcohol-water systems (e.g. methanol-water, ethanol-water, ethylene glycol-water and glycerol-water) and at different alcohol concentrations (e.g. 0–100 vol%). It is not clear at all whether different M/TiO2 photocatalysts (e.g. M = Ni, Pd, Pt, Au) show the same general H2 production patterns with alcohol type and alcohol concentration, motivating a detailed experimental investigation. This study aimed to systematically compare the performance of a 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst and a 2 wt% Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst for H2 production in different alcohol-water systems under UV excitation, placing particular emphasis on the effect of alcohol type (methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol) and alcohol concentration (0–100 vol%) on H2 production rates. The objectives of the study were; (i) to compare the activity of Ni/P25 TiO2 and Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts for H2 production in a wide range of alcohol-water mixtures under exactly the same testing conditions; (ii) to rank the alcohol sacrificial agents in terms of their ability to promote hydrogen evolution as a function of their concentration; (iii) for each alcohol, to determine the optimum alcohol concentration for H2 production; (iv) to further explore relationships between photocatalytic H2 production rates and specific properties of the alcohols (such as the standard oxidation potential or viscosity of the alcohol-water mixtures). The overarching aim of the study was to validate the potential of Ni/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts as low cost alternatives to Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts for solar H2 production in alcohol-water mixtures."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate (≥97%), glycerol (≥99%), urea (≥99.5%), sodium hydroxide (≥98%), ammonia (28 wt%), H2O2 (30 vol%), HF (40 wt%), Degussa P25 TiO2, absolute ethanol (≥99.5%), Ni foil (99.99%) and NiO (≥99.9%) were all obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. All solutions were prepared using milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ cm resistivity). All alcohols used for the H2 production tests were of high purity (>99.9%) and obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The methanol and ethanol were of HPLC grade (>99.99%). A reference photocatalyst, 2 wt% Au/P25 TiO2, was prepared using the deposition-precipitation with urea method described by Zanella et al. [63]. Relevant characterization data for the 2 wt% Au/P25 TiO2 reference photocatalyst is provided in reference [64]."
3,NiO/P25 TiO and Ni/P25 TiO photocatalyst synthesis,"2.2 NiO/P25 TiO and Ni/P25 TiO photocatalyst synthesis A NiO/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst precursor (NiO loading = 0.63 wt%) was prepared by the complex precipitation method [65]. Briefly, nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate and glycerol (1:2 M ratio) were added to milli-Q water (200 mL) to form an aqueous nickel(II)-glycerol complex. The exact mass of nickel (II) nitrate hexahydrate and glycerol were 0.247 g and 0.16 g, respectively. P25 TiO2 (10 g) was then added to the solution containing the nickel(II)-glycerol complex with continuous stirring. The nickel-glycerol complex was then precipitated on the P25 TiO2 support by the dropwise addition of 0.5 M NaOH under constant stirring until a pH of 12 was reached. The resulting suspension was stirred for a further 1 h, and then the resulting light green powder (i.e. Ni(OH)2/P25 TiO2) was collected by vacuum filtration. After washing repeatedly with milli-Q water, the Ni(OH)2/P25 TiO2 powder was dried overnight at 70 °C in air. The 0.63 wt% NiO/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst was obtained by calcination of the Ni(OH)2/P25 TiO2 powder at 300 °C for 2 h. The 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst was obtained by heating the 0.63 wt% NiO/P25 TiO2 precursor under a H2/N2 flow (10 vol% H2, 100 mL min−1) at 500 °C for 2 h [66]. This treatment reduced Ni(II) species to metallic form as evidenced by a change in the colour of the powders from green (characteristic of NiO) to grey (characteristic of finely dispersed Ni0) [27]. Detailed physico-chemical characterization studies were subsequently conducted on both the NiO/P25 TiO2 precursor and Ni/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst."
4,Isolation of anatase and rutile from P25 TiO2,"2.3 Isolation of anatase and rutile from P25 TiO2 To examine the role of anatase-rutile heterojunctions in P25 TiO2 in promoting H2 production, anatase and rutile nanoparticles were isolated from P25 TiO2 by selective chemical dissolution using procedures described by Ohno et al. and Ohtani et al., respectively [67,68]. The anatase component was isolated as follows. Aqueous ammonia (2.5 wt%, 20 mL) was added dropwise to a chilled aqueous H2O2 solution (30 wt%, 600 mL) with constant stirring. Degussa P25 TiO2 powder (5.40 g) was then added to the NH3-H2O2 solution and the resulting suspension was stirred for 12 h at room temperature. The anatase product was then collected by centrifugation at 4400 rpm for 30 min and the yellow supernatant discarded. The anatase powder was washed repeatedly with water and then oven dried at 100 °C for 24 h. The rutile component was isolated by adding P25 TiO2 (30g) to a 7 wt% of aqueous HF solution (1 L) with constant stirring for 24 h at 20 °C. The residual powder was collected by centrifugation at 4400 rpm for 30 min, and the supernatant discarded. The rutile powder was washed repeatedly with milli-Q and then calcined at 550 °C in air for 2 h to remove any residual fluoride. In the text below, the isolated anatase and rutile powders are referred to as anatase and rutile, respectively. Subsequently, 0.5 wt% Ni/anatase and 0.5 wt% Ni/(85% anatase + 15% rutile) photocatalysts were prepared using the method described in Section 2.2. For the preparation of the latter, a physical mixture of isolated anatase (85 wt%) and isolated rutile (15 wt%) was first prepared. This had the same weight fractions of anatase and rutile as P25 TiO2, but no anatase-rutile heterojunctions. Relevant characterization data for the isolate anatase and rutile phases is provided in Ref. [69]."
5,Photocatalyst characterization,"2.4 Photocatalyst characterization UV–Visible absorbance spectra were recorded over the range 220–1400 nm on a Shimadzu UV-2101 PC spectrophotometer equipped with an ISR-240A integrating sphere attachment. Barium sulphate was used as a reflectance standard. TEM images were collected using a TECNAI 12 transmission electron microscope, operated at an electron accelerating voltage of 120 kV. Powder samples were dispersed in absolute ethanol and then 1 µL of the resulting dispersion placed on carbon coated copper TEM grids for analysis. HRTEM microstructural characterization was performed using a JEOL 2010F transmission electron microscope equipped with a field emission source operated at 200 kV. The point-to-point resolution of the electron microscope was 0.19 nm, and the resolution between lines was 0.14 nm. For STEM-HAADF-EDX characterization, the instrument used was a Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN microscope equipped with a field emission electron source operated at 200 kV. The point-to-point resolution was 0.24 nm and the resolution between lines was 0.10 nm. Samples were deposited from alcohol suspensions onto holey-carbon Cu grids for analysis. Powder XRD patterns were taken on a PANalytical Empyrean diffractometer equipped with a Cu anode X-ray tube and a curved graphite filter monochromator. XRD data was collected from 2θ = 10–90° (step 0.02°, scan rate 2° min−1) using Cu Kα X-rays (λ = 1.5418 Å, 40 mA, 40 kV). Anatase and rutile crystallite sizes (L) were determined from the powder XRD data using the Scherrer equation and line-widths of the anatase (1 0 1) reflection at 2θ = 25.3° and rutile (1 1 0) reflection at 2θ = 27.4°, respectively. The rutile:anatase ratio in the samples was determined according to the method described by Ding et al. [70]. % Rutile = 1 1 + 0.8 I A / I R × 100 where IA is the peak intensity for the anatase (1 0 1) reflection, and IR is the peak intensity for the rutile (1 1 0) reflection. Ni K-edge EXAFS data was collected on the BL01B1 beamline of the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (SPring-8). The storage ring was operated at 8 GeV and a ring current of 44–65 mA. A Si(1 1 1) single crystal was used to monochromatize the X-ray beam, and two ion chambers filled with Ar and N2 were used as detectors of I 0 and I, respectively. The 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2 and 0.63 wt% NiO/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts were pressed into thin pellets for the EXAFS measurements, with a specific pellet thickness and density chosen to achieve an edge jump of ∼0.4. All data reported here was collected in transmission mode. For EXAFS analysis, the oscillations were extracted from the EXAFS data by a spline smoothing method, and then normalized by the edge height around 50 eV above the absorption threshold. R-space plots were obtained by performing a Fourier transformation of the k 3-weighted EXAFS oscillation from k-space to r-space over the range 30–140 nm−1. In-situ quick XAFS (QXAFS) analyses were performed following a similar procedure to Okumura et al. [71]. Briefly, 0.63 wt% NiO/P25 TiO2 samples were pressed into 1 mm thick pellets of 7 mm diameter. Multiple pellets were stacked in a custom built quartz holder to achieve an edge jump of 0.3 or greater. The holder was then transferred into an aluminium cell sealed by Kapton windows and connected to a gas flow reaction system. Flow cell gas concentrations were carefully monitored using a quadrapole mass spectrometer in real time. In-situ XAFS analyses on Ni K-edge were carried out at 60 s intervals at 400 °C in either O2:He gas or H2:He gas (both has mixtures had at a fixed volume ratio of 1:99) for Ni oxidation and reduction cycles, respectively. N2 physisorption isotherms were determined at liquid nitrogen temperature (−195 °C) using a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 instrument. Specific surface areas were calculated from the N2 adsorption data according to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method using P/P0 values in the range 0.05–0.2 [72]. Cumulative pore volumes and pore diameters were calculated from the adsorption isotherms by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method [73]. Samples were degassed at 100 °C under vacuum for 1 h prior to the N2 physisorption measurements. All samples had similar N2 physisorption isotherms that could be classified as Type II according to the IUPAC convention for adsorption isotherms. Photoluminescence measurements were performed in air at room temperature using a Perkin-Elmer LS-55 Luminescence Spectrometer. Spectra were excited at 310 nm and photoluminescence spectra were recorded over a range of 330–600 nm using a standard photomultiplier."
6,Photocatalytic hydrogen production tests,"2.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen production tests Photocatalytic hydrogen production tests on the Ni/P25 TiO2, Ni/anatase, Ni/(85% anatase + 15% rutile) and Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts were carried out in a tubular Pyrex reactor (105 mL volume). Photocatalyst (6.5 mg) was placed in the reactor and flushed under a N2 flow for 30 min to remove oxygen. Then, 20 mL of an alcohol-water mixture (0–100 vol% alcohol) was injected into the reactor through a rubber septum and the resulting photocatalyst dispersion stirred continuously for 1 h in the dark (no UV excitation). The reactor was then exposed to UV light, supplied from a Spectraline model SB-100P/F lamp (100 W, 365 nm) at a distance of 10 cm from the reactor. The photon flux at the sample was approximately 6.5 mW cm−2 (the UV flux from the Sun is approximately 5 mW cm−2). Hydrogen evolution was monitored by taking gas head space samples (1 mL) at 20 min intervals and injecting these into a Shimadzu GC 2014 equipped with a TCD detector and Carboxen-1010 plot capillary column (L × I.D. 30 m × 0.53 mm, average thickness 30 μm). H2 evolved was quantified against an external calibration curve of peak area versus moles of H2. Photocatalytic tests for each sample were carried out in triplicate."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Photocatalyst characterization,"3.1 Photocatalyst characterization Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were conducted on the Ni/P25 TiO2 and Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts to establish the approximate mean size and dispersion of the supported Ni and Au co-catalysts. Metallic Ni nanoparticles were difficult to discern by conventional TEM for the 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst due to the similarity in the atomic number of Ni and Ti. However, using HRTEM and EDX, Ni nanoparticles could be readily identified on the surface of the P25 TiO2 support (Fig. 1 (a)–(e)). EDX spectra recorded over the low and high contrast areas “a” and “b” in STEM/HAADF imaging mode allowed identification of Ni and TiO2 particles (Fig. 1(a) and (b)). The low contrast areas are TiO2 and the high contrast areas are Ni-containing particles. To get a better insight into the nature and structure of the nickel-containing particles, HRTEM analysis was carried out at the location of Ni nanoparticles indicated in Fig. 1(c). At the nominal Ni loading of 0.5 wt% (confirmed by XRF, Table 5), the Ni nanoparticles were ∼5–8 nm in size. The metallic nature of the nanoparticles was confirmed by the detailed lattice fringe analysis provided in Fig. 1(d)–(e). Fig. 1(d) shows two anatase particles and a Ni nanoparticle oriented along the (1 1 0) crystallographic direction. The Fourier Transform image recorded over the Ni particle shows spots at 2.04 Å, corresponding to (1 1 1) crystallographic planes of Ni metal [28,40]. Fig. 1(e) shows a FT image with spots at 2.04 and 1.76 Å, corresponding to the (1 1 1) and (2 0 0) crystallographic planes of Ni metal [28]. The HRTEM analyses thus conclusively establish the presence of Ni metal nanoparticles on the surface of the 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst. It should be noted that the HRTEM analysis was performed approximately 1 month after the H2 reduction step used in the synthesis of the photocatalyst (to reduce supported NiO to Ni, Section 2.2). This suggests that the re-oxidation of Ni nanoparticles to NiO proceeds slowly at room temperature (this has important implications for H2 production tests discussed below where we strongly advocate metallic Ni as the active co-catalyst for H2 production). For the 2 wt% Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst, the mean size of the Au nanoparticles was also in the same range (5–8 nm), with the gold nanoparticles being easy to discern from the P25 support even at low magnification (Fig. 1(f)). Powder XRD patterns for P25 TiO2, 0.63 wt% NiO/P25 TiO2, 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2 and 2 wt% Au/P25 TiO2 are shown in Fig. S1. The XRD patterns for all photocatalysts were dominated by peaks due to anatase and rutile in the P25 TiO2 support. The anatase:rutile weight ratio for all photocatalysts was ∼6:1, in good agreement with the manufacturer’s specifications. Average anatase and rutile particle sizes, estimated from the FWHM of the anatase (1 0 1) and rutile (1 1 0) reflections using the Scherrer equation, were 25 nm and 50 nm, respectively. The data confirms that co-catalyst deposition did not change the phase composition of the P25 TiO2 support. No obvious diffraction patterns were seen for NiO or Ni due to the low nominal loadings used here. For the 2 wt% Au/P25 TiO2 sample, very weak and broad peaks around 44° and 64° could be discerned and assigned to fcc Au(2 0 0) and Au(2 2 0) reflections, respectively (note: the most intense Au(1 1 1) reflection is obscured by signals from the P25 TiO2 support). UV–Vis absorbance spectra and corresponding Tauc plots for P25 TiO2, 0.63 wt% NiO/P25 TiO2, 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2 and 2 wt% Au/P25 TiO2 are shown in Fig. 2 . All samples showed intense absorption below 400 nm due to the P25 TiO2 support (Eg ∼ 3.15 eV was determined from the Tauc plots for P25 TiO2). The 0.63 wt% NiO/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst precursor was a light green colour and showed distinctive absorption features at visible wavelengths corresponding to d-d transitions (electron configuration of Ni2+ is 3d8). In contrast, the 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst prepared by H2 reduction of the precursor was grey, absorbing strongly across the entire visible spectrum consistent with the presence of supported metallic nickel nanoparticles. The Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst showed an intense absorption feature centred between 560 and 590 nm, associated with the characteristic Au 5d → 6 sp localised surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Au nanoparticles dispersed on TiO2 [64]. Band gap energies for the P25 TiO2, 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2 and 2 wt% Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts were similar (∼3.15 eV), with the estimation of Eg for the metal co-catalyst modified samples complicated by the metal nanoparticle absorption features. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data for the 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2 and 2 wt% Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts has been reported elsewhere [27,64], and confirmed that metallic Ni and Au were the dominant co-catalyst species on the surface of these photocatalysts. In-situ Ni K-edge X-ray absorption analyses were subsequently conducted to better understand the NiO to Ni reduction process used to “activate” the Ni/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts for H2 production (Figs. 3–5 ). These measurements were very useful for identifying the chemical state of nickel (metallic Ni or NiO) on P25 TiO2 during reduction or oxidation treatments. For the experiments, pellets of the 0.63 wt% NiO/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst precursor were prepared, then transferred to an in-situ cell and subjected to alternating cycles of reduction (1 vol% H2 in He) and oxidation (1 vol% O2 in He) at 400 °C. A reduction temperature of 400 °C was selected so that the reduction process did not happen too quickly (note that we used a reduction temperature of 500 °C when preparing the photocatalyst for H2 production tests). In-situ XAS data collected at the Ni K-edge for the reduction and reoxidation of 0.63 wt% NiO/P25 TiO2 precursor are shown in Fig. 3, along with reference data for Ni foil and NiO. The XANES spectrum of NiO shows intense absorption at ∼8350 eV, which is characteristic of an octahedral NiO6 coordination [28]. The Ni K-edge XANES spectrum for the 0.63 wt% NiO/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst heated to 400 °C similarly showed a strong absorption peak at ∼8350 eV, confirming the presence of NiO (at time = 0). Following introduction of 1 vol% H2 into the sample chamber, a complete reduction of the supported NiO to metallic nickel occurred, evidenced by the disappearance of the 8350 eV feature and the appearance of a distinct shoulder at lower photon energies typical for metallic Ni (the spectrum obtained after H2 treatment at 400 °C was near identical to that of the metallic Ni reference foil). Cycling between an oxygen-containing atmosphere and a hydrogen-containing atmosphere at 400 °C resulted in either NiO or Ni0 being present on the P25 TiO2 surface (Fig. 3), respectively. Finally, the reduced sample was cooled from 400 °C to room temperature under a 1 vol% H2 atmosphere, and then exposed to a 1 vol% O2 atmosphere. No reoxidation of Ni0 to NiO occurred, even after several hours. This supports our earlier statement above that the reoxidation of supported metallic nickel nanoparticles on TiO2 was very slow under ambient conditions (our experience shows that full reoxidation is not achieved even after two years in a close vial at room temperature). Fig. 4 shows the mole fractions of Ni and NiO present as a function of time during the reduction and oxidation steps, determined from the Ni K-edge XANES spectra of Fig. 3. Note that at 400 °C, the oxidation of Ni0 to NiO is rapid (∼12 min) compared to the reduction of NiO to Ni0 (60–70 min). Corresponding R-space plots are shown in Fig. 5. At 400 °C in O2, the NiO/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst showed characteristic peaks at 1.92 Å and 2.90 Å which can be readily assigned to Ni-O and Ni-Ni radial distances in NiO, respectively [28,74–76]. It should be noted that these values were larger than those determined for the NiO reference powder at room temperature (1.65 Å and 2.63 Å, respectively). The larger Ni-O and Ni-Ni radial distances in the in-situ experiment at 400 °C can be attributed to thermal expansion of the NiO lattice, and also possibly the incorporation of oxygen intersitials which are known to cause lattice expansion due to ionic repulsion and thereby increase both Ni-O and Ni-Ni distances [77]. Following H2 reduction at 400 °C, these two features disappeared and were replaced by an intense peak at 2.1 Å corresponding to Ni-Ni in metallic nickel with fcc symmetry based on additional signals at ∼4–6 Å which confirm long range order (Fig. 5) [75,76]. The XANES and EXAFS data thus provide strong evidence that metallic Ni is the dominant (and perhaps only) surface species on the TiO2 support after the H2 reduction treatment (a result qualitatively supported by the HRTEM and UV–vis data presented in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively). Metal co-catalysts (e.g. Ni or Au) are proposed to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 for H2 production under UV excitation by accepting photoexcited electrons from conduction band of TiO2 and serving as cathodic sites for H2 evolution [4,6,8–11,14,17–19,24,27,49–51,64]. Photoluminescence spectra collected in air for P25 TiO2, 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2 and 2 wt% Au/P25 TiO2 are shown in Fig. 6 , and provide direct evidence for suppression of electron-hole pair recombination in the P25 TiO2 support in the presence of the added co-catalysts. Following UV excitation, P25 TiO2 gave a very intense and broad photoluminescence signal centred around 390 nm, which contains contributions from direct and indirect band gap transitions (radiative de-excitation) in anatase and rutile, though mainly the former since anatase is the dominant TiO2 polymorph in P25 TiO2 [78]. The high intensity of the photoluminescence signal observed for P25 TiO2 indicates rapid electron-hole pair recombination occurs following UV excitation. Following deposition of Ni or Au nanoparticles on P25 TiO2, the photoluminescence signal observed was much weaker, confirming that Ni or Au effectively suppresses electron-hole pair recombination in TiO2 by creating a rectifying Schottky junction with TiO2 [21,64]. This result is consistent with expectations, since the Fermi levels of supported Ni nanoparticles and 5 nm Au nanoparticles are located at −0.23 V and −0.27 V versus NHE (cf. the conduction band levels of anatase and rutile are located at −0.5 and −0.7 V versus NHE) [21,36,37]."
9,Effect of co-catalyst loading on photocatalytic hydrogen production rates,"3.2 Effect of co-catalyst loading on photocatalytic hydrogen production rates In preliminary work, we set out to identify the optimum co-catalyst loading for H2 production via alcohol photoreforming for both the Ni/P25 TiO2 and Au/TiO2 systems (Fig. 7 , Table S1-2). The experiments were performed at a fixed alcohol concentration of 10 vol% under UV excitation (365 nm, 6.5 mW cm−2). The optimum Ni loading was 0.5 wt% in each of the four alcohol-water systems, with H2 production rates at all Ni loadings following the order glycerol > ethylene glycol > methanol > ethanol. For Au/P25 TiO2, the optimum Au loading was around 2 wt%, with H2 production rates also following the order glycerol > ethylene glycol > methanol > ethanol. Interestingly in the Au/P25 TiO2 system, the dependence of the rate on the co-catalyst loading was less important than that seen for the Ni/TiO2 system. Based on these preliminary findings, we selected 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2 and 2 wt% Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts for a detailed investigation of the effect of alcohol concentration on H2 production rates."
10,Effect of alcohol concentration on photocatalytic hydrogen production rates,"3.3 Effect of alcohol concentration on photocatalytic hydrogen production rates The photocatalytic performance of the 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2 and 2 wt% Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts were evaluated in methanol-water, ethanol-water, ethylene glycol-water and glycerol water mixtures at alcohol concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 vol% under UV excitation (365 nm, 6.5 mW cm−2). Fig. 8 (a)–(d) shows plots of H2 production versus time for the 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst in the four different alcohol-water mixtures. In all alcohol-water systems, the H2 evolution with time was linear confirming that the photocatalyst was stable under the applied testing conditions. Further, there was no induction period before the H2 evolution commenced, consistent with metallic nickel nanoparticles being the active co-catalyst species for H2 evolution (Ni0 was the only surface species at the commencement of the experiment and after the experiment, evidenced by UV–Vis spectroscopy and TEM analyses on the as-synthesized and post-reaction photocatalysts). Hydrogen production rates determined from Fig. 8 are summarized in Fig. 9 and Table S3-6. Fig. 9 shows that H2 production rates for the 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst were highly dependent on the alcohol concentration, with the optimum concentration for methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol being 40, 95, 20 and 10 vol%, respectively. H2 production rates at the optimum concentration were 31.1, 24.3, 24.6 and 26.0 mmol g−1 h−1, respectively. In comparison with data presented in Table 1, these rate are amongst the highest yet reported for a Ni/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst. Corresponding plots of H2 production versus time for the 2 wt% Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst are shown in Fig. S2, with the H2 production rates extracted from Fig. S2 plotted in Fig. 10 and listed Table S3-6. The data for the 2 wt% Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst showed close similarities to the 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst in the different alcohol-water systems, showing similar optimum alcohol concentrations (for methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol, the optimum alcohol concentration for the Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst was 40, 80, 20 and 15 vol%, respectively). H2 production rates at the optima were 29.7, 32.4, 26.4 and 32.7 mmol g−1 h−1, respectively. Comparing Figs. 9 and 10, it can be seen that the 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst displayed superior performance to the 2 wt% Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst in methanol-water mixtures, whereas the latter generally demonstrated slightly better performance in the other alcohol-water mixtures (except at ethanol concentrations <10 vol% where Ni/P25 TiO2 had a slight advantage). However, the main finding of this study is that for all four alcohol-water systems studied, the same general pattern of H2 production versus alcohol concentration was observed for both the 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2 and 2 wt% Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts. The quantum efficiency (QE) is an important parameter used in the quantitative comparison of photocatalyst performance for a particular photoreaction [79,80]. Taking the H2 production data determined for the 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2 and 2 wt% Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts in 10 vol% alcohol, we calculated the quantum efficiencies for these photoreactions (see supporting information). For 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2, QE values of 22.2, 16.4, 30.3 and 36.8% were determined in 10 vol% methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol, respectively (Table 1). For 2 wt% Au/P25 TiO2, QE values of 23.9, 14.6, 36.5 and 42.9% were determined in 10 vol% methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol, respectively (see supporting information). The data indicates that our photocatalyst test system is well optimised, especially in terms of catalyst concentration, thereby allowing effective capture of incoming UV photons. The data reflects the excellent hole scavenging abilities of the four alcohols, meaning that a significant fraction of the photoexcited electrons are used in the production of H2. The equation used here to calculate the QE is based on a 2 photon → 2 electron → one molecule of H2 mechanism. However, current doubling is certainly a possibility here [81,82], wherein the following reactions give a 1 photon → 2 electron → one molecule of H2 mechanism. hν(TiO2) → hvb + + ecb − R + hvb + → R + R + → R2+ + ecb − 2H+ + 2ecb − → H2 Indeed, the oxidation potentials of many alpha hydroxy radicals (R +) obtained by alcohol photo-oxidation have oxidation potentials more negative versus NHE than the TiO2 CB, which should favour the current doubling pathway. As the current doubling path is still under debate, we have stuck with the 2 photon path in our quantum yield calculations which is the convention for the field (note: for the current doubling path, the quantum yields reported herein would need to be halved since half the number of electrons would be needed to produce the same amount of H2). The shift in the optimum alcohol concentration for H2 production with alcohol type warrants further discussion. Table 2 shows redox equations for methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol reforming, as well as calculated standard oxidation potentials (versus NHE) calculated from the Gibbs free energy change for the reforming reactions. If we consider in the first instance only methanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol (i.e. alcohols with a O/C ratio of 1), then the molar ratio H2O:alcohol required for the reforming reaction are 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1 respectively. Accordingly, it is intuitive that methanol reforming should occur at a lower water concentration than ethylene glycol reforming, with the reforming of the latter occur at a lower water concentration than glycerol reforming. Indeed, that is the exact trend seen in the photocatalytic data of Figs. 9 and 10, with the optimum concentration for H2 production being 40 vol% in methanol-water mixtures (at this concentration the molar ratio H2O:methanol = 3.4:1), at 20 vol% in ethylene glycol-water systems (molar ratio H2O:ethylene glycol = 12.5:1) and at ∼10–15 vol% in glycerol-water systems (molar ratio H2O:glycerol = ∼30:1). Clearly both alcohol and water are needed to achieve high H2 production rates (in the absence of added alcohol, H2 production rates were ∼1 mmol g−1 h−1 for both the 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2 and 2 wt% Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts under UV, with rates in pure alcohol also being very low). The observation that the optimum alcohol concentration for each alcohol-water system differed somewhat from the theoretical molar H2O:alcohol ratios predicted for methanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol reforming (Table 2) hints at other factors being important to the photoreaction rate, especially for ethylene-glycol and glycerol-water mixtures at higher alcohol concentrations. An important experimental parameter that likely influenced the optimum alcohol concentration for the ethylene glycol-water and glycerol-water systems was solution viscosity. At high concentrations, aqueous solutions of ethylene glycol and glycerol become viscous, which has obvious implications for photoreactions in terms of transport of reactants and products to and from the photocatalyst surface, respectively. At 30 °C, viscosities of neat methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol are 0.659, 1.280, 13.868 and 612 centipoise (cP), respectively [83,84]. In Fig. S3, H2 production rates for the 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst were plotted against solution viscosity for each alcohol-water system. Corresponding data for the 2 wt% Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst is plotted in Fig. S4. In the case of ethylene glycol-water and glycerol-water mixtures, H2 production rates decreased very sharply with increasing viscosity (i.e. increasing alcohol concentration). For the methanol-water and ethanol-water systems, the viscosity change over the whole range of concentrations tested (0–100 vol%) was 1–2 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the ethylene glycol-water and glycerol-water systems, and hence solution viscosity would have a much lesser impact on H2 production rates. Finally, it is apparent from Figs. 9 and 10 that the optimum concentration for ethanol photoreforming (80–95 vol% depending on the photocatalyst) was much higher than them optimal concentrations determined for the other alcohols. Whilst the theoretical molar ratio H2O:ethanol for ethanol reforming is 3:1, the lower O/C ratio of 0.5 and the presence of the ethyl group (not present for any of the other alcohols) clearly have an impact on the optimum ethanol concentration. Although a detailed analysis of the other was not performed here (i.e. products other than H2), it is reasonable to assume that much of the H2 produced during ethanol photoreactions over the 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2 and 2 wt% Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts originated from the partial oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde (i.e. CH3CH2OH + 2 h+ → CH3CHO + 2H+ followed by 2H+ + 2e− → H2) instead of the full photoreforming reaction (CH3CH2OH + 3H2O + 12 h+ → 2CO2 + 12H+ followed by 12H+ + 12e− → 6H2) [20,21,43–48]. We performed some preliminary analyses on the other gaseous products formed during ethanol photoreforming, detecting H2 (dominant product), CO2, O2, CO, CH4 and C2H4. The H2/CO2 ratio far exceeds that expected from ethanol photoreforming (CH3CH2OH + 3H2O → 2CO2 + 6H2 which should yield a H2:CO2 = 3:1), indicating that only a small fraction of the ethanol is fully reformed. Some CO2 formed was also likely dissolved in the aqueous reaction medium). This would explain why the optimum ethanol concentration was very high, since the partial oxidation route produces H2 but does not consume H2O. Cleavage of the CC bond in ethanol or acetaldehyde or acetates (formed via CH3CHO + 2 h+ + H2O → CH3COOH + 2H+) is possibly the rate limiting step in the full ethanol photoreforming reaction. Ethylene glycol and glycerol also contain CC bonds, though each carbon atom in these alcohols is also bonded to oxygen, making the stepwise oxidation of the alcohol to the aldehyde and eventually to CO2 thermodynamically easier though the mechanisms involved are complex. Ethylene glycol is first oxidised to glycolaldehyde (HOCH2CH2OH + 2 h+ → HOCH2CHO + 2H+), glycolaldehyde to glyoxal (HOCH2CHO + 2 h+ → HOCCOH + 2H+), glyoxal to glycolic acid (HOCCOH + H2O → HOCOCH2OH), glycolic acid to oxalic acid (HOCOCH2OH + 4 h+ + H2O → HOOCCOOH + 4H+) and finally oxalic acid to CO2 (HOOCCOOH + 2 h+ → 2CO2 + 2H+) [85,86]. For glycerol-water mixtures, the mechanism is still under investigation, but the major photocatalytic processes involved are thought to be the oxidation of glycerol to glycolaldehyde and formic acid (HOCH2CH(OH)CH2OH + H2O + 4 h+ → HOCH2CHO + HCOOH + 4H+) [82] and the secondary oxidation of glycolaldehyde to formic acid and formaldehyde (HOCH2CHO + H2O + 4 h+ → HCOOH + HCHO + 4H+) followed by the simple photocatalytic oxidation of formic acid and formaldehyde to CO2 [87]."
11,Effect of alcohol structure on photocatalytic hydrogen production rates,"3.4 Effect of alcohol structure on photocatalytic hydrogen production rates Following examination of the influence of alcohol concentration on photocatalytic hydrogen production rates, the structural effect of the alcohols was investigated. To minimize the impact of solution viscosity on H2 production rates, we have made the analyses at an alcohol concentration of 10 vol%, at which concentration all alcohols gave solutions of very similar viscosity (between 1 and 2 centipoise). Table 3 shows H2 production rates determined for the 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2 and 2 wt% Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts in 10 vol% methanol-water, ethanol-water, ethylene glycol-water and glycerol-water mixtures (data collected for the same photocatalysts at 80 vol% alcohol is also tabulated). The data for both photocatalysts collected at 10 vol% reveals the same general trend, with H2 production rates decreasing in the order glycerol > ethylene glycol > methanol > ethanol. In order to understand the trend seen in the H2 production rates, the structure and physical properties of the four different alcohols are further considered. Table 4 summarises key physical properties of the four alcohols studied in this work. In Figs. 11 and 12 we have plotted H2 production rates against specific properties of the alcohols, namely (i) the number of alpha hydrogens on the alcohol, (ii) the number of OH groups on the alcohol, (iii) alcohol polarity and finally (iv) exp(−ΔE°), where ( i n t h e l a t t e r c a s e w i t h H (in the latter case with H2 production rates normalised to alcohol polarity; the justification for which is discussed below). Linear correlations are seen for (i), (iii) and (iv), with (ii) deviating most from linearity due to ethanol having an O/C ratio of 0.5, whereas the O/C ratio is 1 for all the other alcohols tested. The photoreforming of the alcohols can be represented by the following general equation [48]: C x H y O z + (2x − z)H2O → xCO2 + nH+ + ne− where x, y and z are the number of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the alcohol, respectively, and n is the number of protons or electrons liberated. The photoreaction will proceed via the formation of alpha hydroxyl radicals in the aqueous media followed by oxidation to the corresponding aldehyde, which accounts for the importance of α-H atoms on the alcohol to achieving high H2 production rates [11]. The dependence of H2 production rates on alcohol polarity and alcohol oxidation potential are in accord with the findings of Yang et al. for the Pt/TiO2 system and Al-Azri et al. for Pd/TiO2, Pt/TiO2 and Au/TiO2 systems [14,21]. The standard oxidation potentials (Eox°) calculated for methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol (Table 2) were 0.016, 0.084, 0.009 and 0.004 V versus NHE, respectively, all significantly lower than the oxidation potential of water (1.23 V versus NHE). Glycerol and ethylene glycol afforded the highest H2 production rates for Ni/P25 TiO2 and Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts (Table 3), which can be rationalised in terms of their low oxidation potentials making them the best sacrificial hole scavengers. Considering a simple electron transfer reaction between an electron donor and an electron acceptor (valence band holes in TiO2 in this case) [88], the experimental reaction rate for such reactions may follow the relation: k exp ∝ exp - E V B Ti O 2 o - E ox o / RT where E VB ( T i O 2 ) o and E ox o the valence band potential of TiO2 (2.7 V for anatase) and the oxidation potential of the donor (alcohol or water), respectively [21,36,37]. For a zero order reaction, the rate = k. If electron transfer from the alcohols or water to TiO2 was the overall rate limiting step in photocatalytic H2 production over Ni/P25 TiO2 and Au/P25 TiO2 surfaces, then H2 production rates could be expected to correlate with exp - E VB Ti O 2 o - E ox o . Fig. 12(b) confirms a linear relationship between the H2 production rates normalised against alcohol polarity and exp - E VB Ti O 2 o - E ox o for both the Ni/P25 TiO2 and Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts. To construct the figure, the reaction rate for each photocatalyst in 10 vol% alcohol (negating the effect of viscosity) was divided by the alcohol polarity (negating the polarity effect), then plotted versus exp - E VB Ti O 2 o - E ox o . Data for 2 vol% alcohol, where the solution viscosity was very close to that of pure water, followed the same general trend. In Fig. 12(b), data for methanol showed an obvious deviation from linearity, which may be due to the partial poisoning of the photocatalyst by reaction-derived CO or formats during reaction (thereby lowering the H2 rate compared to expectations based on the standard oxidation potential of the alcohol), as has previously been reported by other groups [11–13]."
12,Synergistic role of anatase-rutile heterojunctions in H2 production over the Ni/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst,"3.5 Synergistic role of anatase-rutile heterojunctions in H2 production over the Ni/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst Previous studies of P25 TiO2 photocatalysts have demonstrated the critical role of anatase-rutile heterojunctions in promoting rates of aqueous dye degradation and also photocatalytic H2 production [69,89]. Under UV excitation, both anatase and rutile generate charge carriers (electron-hole pairs). Rutile is a direct band gap semiconductor whereas anatase is an indirect band gap semiconductor, thus rates of electron-hole pair generation (and also recombination) are much faster in rutile than in anatase [90]. By fusing anatase and rutile nanoparticles, as is the case in P25 TiO2, conduction band electrons in rutile can migrate into the conduction band of anatase, whilst valence band holes in anatase migrate into the valence band of rutile [86]. The net effect of the anatase-rutile heterojunctions in P25 TiO2 is thus a significant improvement in charge separation following photoexcitation which increases the number of charge carriers (holes and electrons) reaching the photocatalyst surface and participating in photoreactions [91–96]. To date, this is the most convincing argument forwarded to explain why P25 TiO2-based photocatalysts generally display superior photocatalytic activities to single polymorph TiO2 photocatalysts (e.g. pure anatase, brookite or rutile) [97]. To determine the extent to which anatase-rutile heterojunctions promoted photocatalytic H2 production in the 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2 system, we prepared further photocatalysts using anatase and rutile nanoparticles isolated from P25 TiO2 by selective chemical dissolution (see methods section). Fig. S5 shows XRD patterns for the anatase and rutile nanoparticles isolated by this approach, which were almost pure phase. From these isolated anatase and rutile nanoparticles, a 0.5 wt% Ni/anatase photocatalyst, a 0.5 wt% Ni/Rutile photocatalyst and a 0.5 wt% Ni/(85% anatase + 15% rutile – physical mixture) photocatalyst were prepared, and their performance evaluated against the 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst for H2 production in 10 vol% alcohol-water mixtures under UV excitation. Results are shown in Fig. 12 and Table 5 . Fig. 13 (a)–(c) show that all photocatalysts were stable under the testing conditions; linear H2 production with time. Also, all three photocatalysts showed the same general trend in H2 production rates, with rates decreasing in the already observed order glycerol > ethylene glycol > methanol > ethanol (Table 5 and Fig. 13(d)). However, in all alcohol-water systems tested, H2 production rates were significantly higher for the 0.5 wt% Ni/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst than the other Ni/TiO2 catalysts, emphasizing the importance of interfacial electron and hole migration at the anatase-rutile interface to the high photoactivity of P25 TiO2. Such migration is not possible in the case of Ni/Anatase or Ni/Rutile or Ni/(85% anatase + 15% rutile – physical mixture) photocatalysts. Actually, the activity of Ni/(85% anatase + 15% rutile – physically mixed) seems to scale with the content of anatase and rutile phases as previously reported on Au/TiO2 (anatase + rutile) – physically mixed) [64]. Results indicate that anatase–rutile heterojunctions enhance the photocatalytic performance of M/P25 TiO2 phototcatalysts for H2 production in alcohol-water mixtures, with the effect largely independent of the metal co-catalyst on the TiO2 support."
13,Schematic of photocatalytic H2 production in the Ni/P25 TiO2 (or Au/P25 TiO2) system,"3.6 Schematic of photocatalytic H2 production in the Ni/P25 TiO2 (or Au/P25 TiO2) system Fig. 14 shows a schematic energy diagram of the key processes leading to H2 evolution over the Ni/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts [27,36,37]. Photoexcitation under UV generates electron hole pairs in both TiO2 polymorphs [91,95,98], with electrons proposed to be accumulated in the conduction band of anatase and holes in the valence band of rutile due to the favorable offsets of their respective valence and conduction bands. The valence band holes migrate to the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles (especially to the surface of rutile) and oxidize alcohols and to a lesser extent water to generate H+, whilst electrons in the conduction band of the TiO2 nanoparticles (mainly in anatase) migrate onto Ni0 nanoparticles (or Au0 nanoparticles) which serve as cathodic sites for H2 evolution (2H+ + 2e− → H2). The appropriate Fermi level position of Ni0 (or Au0) together with its high work function creates an effective Schottky barrier preventing the unwanted migration of electrons back into the conduction band of TiO2."
14,Conclusion,"Ni/P25 TiO2 and Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts exhibit similar photocatalytic activity for H2 production in alcohol-water mixtures under UV excitation. For both photocatalyst systems and alcohol concentrations up to ca. 10 vol%, H2 production rates were found to decrease in the order glycerol > ethylene glycol > methanol > ethanol. This trend can be attributed to the combined effect of alcohol polarity and redox potential with respect to the VB of TiO2. H2 production rates were also strongly dependent on the alcohol concentration, which varied in optimum concentration from 10 vol% for glycerol to around 80–90 vol% for ethanol. These large variations are linked to the viscosity of the alcohol-water solutions, in addition to alcohol polarity and redox potential. Isolating the two component phases of P25 TiO2, decorating them with Ni nanoparticles, then physically mixing these in a 6:1 wt ratio did not achieve the same H2 production performance as that observed for Ni/P25 TiO2. Accordingly, anatase-rutile heterojunctions in the P25 TiO2 support were identified as being important for enhancing charge separation in Ni/P25 TiO2 under UV, increasing the number of charge carriers available for photoreactions and thus affording very high H2 production rates. Rates reported here for Ni/P25 TiO2 are amongst the highest known for a non-precious metal-based photocatalyst system."
