0,Introduction,"Canada's federal and provincial governments mandated the addition of 2% renewable diesel to petro-diesel in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, a sector that contributes around 25% to global emissions [1]. Of the renewable resources, biomass is the only one that can be directly converted to a liquid renewable fuel to replace fossil fuel. 9% of the world's boreal forests are found in Canada; 94% of them are owned by the Government of Canada and most of this is leased to private companies [2]. With proper harvesting practices and land-use planning, this feedstock (the forests) can be used as a resource for biofuels. In addition, in Western Canada, about 27 million tons of agricultural residue is available that is not used for soil conservation and livestock [3]. These lignocellulosic feedstocks are also good candidates for biofuel production. Fast pyrolysis is a well-known thermochemical conversion technology that can convert solid biomass to an intermediate liquid product (bio-oil), gas, and biochar in the absence of oxygen and at a high heating rate. The bio-oil can be further upgraded to a transportation fuel through hydroprocessing technology to produce renewable diesel and gasoline. The properties of renewable diesel from biomass are similar to those of petro-diesel [4]. Many studies are available on the conversion of biomass to bio-oil through fast pyrolysis [5–10]. These studies found that bio-oil quality and quantity are a function of feedstock type, pyrolysis reactor, heating rate, and particle size distribution of the feed. Bio-oil yield varies by feedstock because of the differences in the chemical and elemental composition of biomass. Researchers have studied various pyrolysis reactors such as fixed bed, bubbling bed, fluidized bed, cyclone bed, vacuum reactor, etc. [9,10]. Of the reactors, the fluidized bed reactor yields the most bio-oil because it allows for the right contact between biomass and the fluidizing medium. As fast pyrolysis is a well-understood and commercially viable process, many studies have carried out techno-economic analyses of bio-oil production from different biomass feedstocks. The production cost of bio-oil is between 0.13 $ L−1 and 0.65 $ L−1 [11–14]. The reported total capital cost is between 40 M$ and 150 M$ for a 1000 dry t d−1 pyrolysis plant [15,16]. The differences in bio-oil production cost are due to feedstock type, biomass cost (harvesting and transportation cost), bio-oil yield, and pyrolysis plant capital cost. Biomass cost is location-specific and depends on yield, cultivation method, and transportation cost. To upgrade bio-oil to renewable diesel, hydroprocessing technology is generally used; it is well established in the petroleum industry. Hydrogen (H2) is used to upgrade the bio-oil to the hydrocarbon range by removing the oxygen in the form of water. A few techno-economic studies are available on the upgrading pathway from bio-oil, which acts as an intermediate. Wright et al. determined the H2 production costs of naphtha and diesel through the fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing of corn stover in the United States for a 2000 dry t d−1 plant; the costs are 0.94 $ L−1 and 0.64 $ L−1 in the H2 production and the purchase scenarios, respectively [17]. In 2010 in the United States, Brown et al. explored fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing technology for corn stover to the gasoline and diesel range for the same plant capacity and reported the production cost to be 0.79 $ L−1 [18]. Their study included a 90 M $ boiler and a 30 M $ turbine to produce electricity, which raised the capital costs to 492 M $. Shemfe et al. investigated the production of gasoline and diesel through fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing technology in a 72 t d−1 plant from pine wood in the United Kingdom [19]. The estimated cost is 2.17 $ L−1 gasoline equivalent; their figure is very high because the plant the authors considered had a low capacity (72 t d−1). A few more studies investigate different end products through fast pyrolysis and the upgrading process [20–24]. The above-mentioned studies focused on a single feedstock in techno-economic assessments of transportation fuels, were conducted in different jurisdictions, and are based on the authors' assumptions, and so the renewable fuel costs differ considerably. The production cost of renewable diesel depends significantly on the pyrolysis plant location (which affects biomass transportation cost), the logistics of bio-oil use, and the feedstock itself. These factors need to be considered in an integrated way. Earlier studies put limited focus on integration. The current study addresses these gaps. Recent work by the authors estimated the production cost of renewable diesel from Canadian aspen hardwood in a hydrogen purchase scenario [25]. The current study focuses on the comparative experimental and techno-economic assessment of woody biomass and agricultural residues used to produce renewable diesel and gasoline. These assessments are essential to ultimately determine which feedstock is the best to use for the production of renewable diesel and gasoline under the same process conditions. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no study that compares the fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing of several Canadian biomass feedstocks to produce renewable diesel and gasoline in hydrogen purchase and hydrogen production scenarios. In addition, it is important to explore the differences in the production cost of renewable diesel as a function of biochar selling price to improve the applicability of the pyrolysis process. Therefore, the effects of byproduct (biochar) selling price on the production cost of renewable diesel for three feedstocks in two scenarios, hydrogen production and purchase, were also investigated. In addition to process modelling for techno-economic assessment, experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of process parameters on bio-oil yield in a fluidized bed reactor for three Canadian biomass feedstocks (spruce, corn stover, and wheat straw). This study is an assessment of the production of renewable diesel and gasoline through fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing technology for a plant capacity of 2000 t d−1 from Canadian feedstocks. A process model was developed using both experimental and literature data. The specific objectives are: 1. To characterize the physical and chemical properties of three Canadian biomass feedstocks (spruce hardwood, corn stover, and wheat straw) and perform fast pyrolysis experiments using a fluidized bed reactor at temperatures of 400–550 °C for three particle size distributions (0.125–0.425 mm, 0.425–1 mm, and 1–2 mm); 2. To develop a detailed process and cost model for fast pyrolysis and the hydroprocessing unit for a plant capacity of 2000 dry t d−1 to determine renewable diesel and gasoline costs; 3. To estimate the production cost of renewable diesel and gasoline through two scenarios: a. The hydrogen production scenario: H2 used for hydroprocessing is produced through steam reforming the non-condensable gases. This scenario includes a power generation unit. b. The hydrogen purchase scenario: H2 used for hydroprocessing is purchased from outside sources. 4. To analyze the effects of byproduct costs (biochar selling price) on the renewable diesel cost for all three feedstocks and to estimate the net energy ratio to understand the production of useful sustainable renewable energy with respect to the consumption of fossil fuel input on the overall process, from harvesting to renewable fuel production"
1,Materials and method,
2,Feedstock preparation,"2.1 Feedstock preparation Three lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks – spruce, wheat straw, and corn stover – were selected for this study. Spruce (Picea abies) wood chips, corn stover (Zea mays ssp. mays L.), and wheat straw (Triticum aestivum L.) were collected from Weyerhaeuser in Drayton Valley, from southern Alberta, and from northern Alberta, Canada, respectively. The feedstock particle sizes supplied were inappropriate for the fast pyrolysis experiments and so were ground to less than 2 mm and dried in an oven at 100 °C. The samples were then classified into three size distributions (0.125–0.425 mm, 0.425–1 mm, and 1–2 mm) using screens. To avoid contact with atmospheric moisture, the prepared samples were stored in properly sealed plastic bags. Table 1 summarizes the biomass properties of the feedstocks [26–29]. A proximate analysis of the biomass was conducted in LECO TGA 701 to determine the percentages of moisture, volatile, fixed carbon, and ash using ASTM d7582, and an ultimate analysis was carried out in a Carlo Erba EA1108 Elemental Analyzer to determine the CHNS (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur) and oxygen. For accuracy, both analyses were done three times. The average values are reported in the Table 1."
3,Experimental set-up,"2.2 Experimental set-up Fast pyrolysis experiments of three Canadian feedstocks – spruce, corn stover and wheat straw –were conducted in a laboratory-scale batch fluidized bed reactor. Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the fast pyrolysis apparatus. The reactor system consists of a feeder, a fluidized bed reactor, a cyclone separator, a nitrogen flow meter, a biochar collector, and condensers. The biomass feeder consists of two manually operated valves. The fluidized bed reactor is made of stainless steel and has a 120 cm long cylindrical tube with an internal diameter 10 cm. A 35 cm high detachable reactor bed is placed at the end of the long cylindrical tube and, to ensure the uniform distribution of nitrogen gas for the fluidization of the reactor feed, a perforated plate is embedded at the top of the bed. The internal diameter of the holes in the perforated plate is 40 μm. The reactor is heated indirectly by a vertical split furnace with three heated zones, and a K-type thermocouple is used to monitor the temperature of the experiments. The temperature is calibrated to estimate errors in reaction temperature, which are within ±5%. 100 g of biomass is introduced into the reactor after the targeted reactor temperature is reached. Nitrogen is used as the fluidizing gas, and silica sand, with a particle size of 230–330 μm, is used as the fluidizing bed material. The sand-to-biomass ratio is 5:1. The pyrolysis vapor produced in the reactor is passed through the cyclone, which is made of stainless steel. The cyclone can separate the smallest solid particles of 10 μm and collects the biochar in the char collector under the cyclone. After the solid residues are separated, the pyrolysis vapor is passed through a series of glass condensers. To condense the vapor, the condensers are cooled in a cooling medium, a mixture of ice and cold water. The liquid, after condensation, is collected in glass pots connected to the end of the condensers. Finally, non-condensable gases are passed to the vent with fluidizing gas nitrogen."
4,Product characterization,"2.3 Product characterization An Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC/MS) is used to analyze bio-oil samples of different biomass feedstocks. The GC/MS consists of a gas chromatograph coupled to a quadrupole mass spectrometer with a capillary column (J&W Scientific DB-5, 30mx0.25 mm, 0.25 mm). In this analysis, the injector temperature is 200 °C; the volume of injected sample is 1 μL; the split ratio is 100:1; and the oven temperature is held at 40 °C for 1 min, then increased to 50 °C (at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1) and up to 300 °C (at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1). A micro gas chromatograph (Varian CP 4900) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) is used to analyze the composition of the non-condensable gaseous samples. In the micro GC, the injector temperature, column temperature, and column pressure are 100 °C, 100 °C, and 30 psi. The analyzed compositions were used as yield data in the process model for the reactor design and subsequently in the economic analyzer to estimate renewable diesel production cost. Fig.2 shows experimental procedure to produce bio-oil through fast pyrolysis process in a fluidized bed reactor."
5,Modelling,
6,Process modelling,"3.1 Process modelling Fig. 3 is the process flow diagram of biomass feedstock conversion to transportation fuel. The conversion has five major unit operations: the biomass pre-treatment, the pyrolysis and product separation, the hydroprocessing and fractionation, the steam reforming, and the power production. Aspen Plus® software is used to model these processes. The process conditions are summarized in Table 2 [17,24,25,30], and Table 3 represents the mass flow of output streams for fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing technology. The biomass pre-treatment unit consists of a grinder, dryer, and screen separator. The biomass as received from the supplier is not appropriate for pyrolysis because of the particle size and moisture content. Therefore, the biomass, supplied at a particle size 6–10 mm, is fed into a crusher to reduce it to less than 2 mm and from there to a screen separator to remove the oversized from the required undersized feed. The oversized are returned to the crusher for further grinding. The final undersized feed is dried in a rotary dryer to lower the moisture content to 7 wt%. The initial moisture content of spruce, corn stover, and straw biomass as received is 50%, 25%, and 14%, respectively, by weight. After this pre-treatment, the processed feed is sent to the fluidized bed pyrolyzer. The pyrolysis unit consists of a fluidized bed reactor, a cyclone separation unit, a condenser, and a bio-oil storage tank. In the pyrolyzer, biomass is rapidly heated to 450–550 °C (depending on the feedstock) and atmospheric pressure to yield bio-oil, gases, and biochar. Biochar is separated in the cyclone separator. The efficiency of the cyclone is assumed to be 95%. After the separation of the solids, the pyrolysis vapor is sent to a series of condensers to get the liquid products and non-condensable gases that are used in the hydrogen generation unit to produce H2. The bio-oil produced through fluidized bed fast pyrolysis process from different biomass feedstocks consists of several organic compounds such as acid, aldehyde, ketone, phenol, carbohydrate, toluene, alcohol, etc., of similar composition to other bio-oils reported in the literature [17,25]. Therefore, in this study, the operating conditions considered for upgrading bio-oil from several biomass feedstocks through hydroprocessing technology is assumed to be similar to those reported by Wright et al. [17] and Patel et al. [25] and are described in the subsequent paragraphs. The hydroprocessing unit has three stages: first stage hydrotreating, second stage hydrotreating, and hydrocracking. As the names suggest, all three processes are done in a H2-rich atmosphere, and the mass ratio of hydrogen required to upgrade the bio-oil is 1:30; this ratio is taken from the literature [17,25]. Hydrotreating is also known as a low-temperature hydrogenation process and is done in a fixed bed reactor at a temperature and pressure of between 180 and 250 °C and 70–150 bar, respectively [31]. The treated oil is further upgraded at an extremely high temperature (300–400 °C) and pressure (150–200 bar) in the second stage hydrotreater. In both stages, sulfided nickel‑molybdenum is used as the catalyst bed. The bio-oil produced through the fast pyrolysis process is highly acidic, unstable, immiscible with hydrocarbons, and corrosive due to the high oxygen content, all of which need upgrading. In the first stage hydrotreater, the raw bio-oil is stabilized by converting the acidic and ketonic compounds such as acetic acid, benzoic acid, etc., through partial hydrodeoxygenation to small acid and alcohol compounds with some lighter gaseous compounds such as methane, ethane, etc., through the decarbonylation and methanation reactions. Then the first stage hydrotreated oil is processed in the second stage hydrotreater to remove all the oxygen atoms in the form of water through a complete hydrodeoxygenation reaction in presence of excess hydrogen and a catalyst. In this stage, all the phenol and phenol-derived compounds, aldehyde and acid intermediates, alcohol, guaiacol, etc., are converted to C4–C14 hydrocarbons (such as paraffin, aromatics, naphtha compounds, indene, etc., with lighter gaseous compounds). Finally, the upgraded oil from the second stage hydrotreater is passed to the hydrocracking unit, which operates between 400 and 500 °C and a pressure around 200 bar in the presence of the same sulfided nickel‑molybdenum catalyst [17,25]. Hydrocracking, hydrodealkylation, depolymerisation, and deoxygenation are the major reactions in the hydrocracker that break the high molecular weight compounds in the hydrotreated oil to low molecular weight compounds in diesel and gasoline ranges. The off-gases from both the hydrotreater and hydrocracker units are sent to the power generation unit and the hydrocracked oil is processed in the fractionation unit to produce gasoline and diesel fuel [32,33]. Table 3 summarizes the yield of major outputs from the different feedstocks from fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing technology. For this modelling, two H2 scenarios were considered, merchant hydrogen and hydrogen production (at the plant site). For the merchant scenario, H2 is purchased from an external source at a cost of 0.73 $ kg−1 [34]. For the H2 production scenario, H2 is produced on site through steam reforming of non-condensable gases from pyrolysis in a fixed bed reformer. As hydrogen produced from reforming of uncondensable gases (produced from fast pyrolysis) is sufficient for the upgrading of bio-oil, no extra natural gas is considered for the analysis. In the reformer, temperature and pressure are maintained at 800–850 °C and 20–25 bar in the presence of a noble metal Pt/Al2O3 catalyst [35]. This catalyst activates the reforming reaction to enhance H2 production over carbon monoxide (CO). Before entering the reformer, the reactants (both the non-condensable gases and steam) are compressed to a pressure of 23–30 bar. Then the products from the reformer are sent to a high temperature water gas shift (WGS) reactor to convert the CO to H2 in the presence of water. In the WGS reactor, carbon monoxide reacts with water to form H2 and carbon dioxide at a temperature of 300–450 °C in presence of an iron oxide catalyst (FeO) [36]. Electricity is generated in the plant by combusting the off-gases from the hydroprocessing unit. The combustion of off-gases takes place in the presence of water and air to produce high-pressure steam (50 bar), and the generated steam is used in the single-stage turbine to produce electricity for the facility."
7,Economic parameters,"3.2 Economic parameters The equipment cost for fast pyrolysis and upgrading technology is estimated through the Aspen Process Economic Analyzer (APEA). First, the complete process model is developed in the Aspen Plus® platform using both experimental and literature data. Once the process model is successfully analyzed, it is used to estimate the equipment cost for the entire process. In techno-economic model, each piece of equipment is mapped and sized to the actual design parameter. The design parameters were obtained from the literature and vendor data. To estimate the total plant investment cost, Peters and Timmerhaus's method [37] was used and is summarized in Table 4 . Once equipment is purchased, it is installed at a cost of 3.02 times the total purchased equipment cost; these are the project's direct costs. Installation costs include piping, electrical, yard improvement, building, equipment, installation, etc. [37]. The indirect cost is 0.89 times the total equipment purchase cost and is made up of the contractor's fee, legal expenses, construction expenses, and engineering and supervision costs [37]. The direct and indirect costs, combined with contingency and location factor, form the capital cost for the pyrolysis and hydroprocessing units. It is assumed that the pyrolysis and hydroprocessing plants are situated at the same place to avoid bio-oil transportation costs and that the hypothetical plant is located in the Western Canada. The cost model uses regional labor, supervisor, and utility rates. The feedstocks considered in the analysis are locally available biomass. Table 5 summarizes the key characteristics of the plant assumed for this analysis; the same approach was used recently by Agbor et al. [38] The plant lifetime is assumed to be 20 years with plant construction beginning three years before start-up. The plant construction cost distribution is 20%, 45%, and 35%, respectively, for years 3, 2 and 1 [25,34]. The efficiency of the plant is assumed to be 70% in the first year, 80% in the second, and 85% in the third year and beyond. Plant maintenance costs are assumed to be 3% of the total project investment cost. A location factor of 10% of the total fixed investment is considered to accommodate jurisdictional requirements [25,34]. A camping cost of 5% of the total project investment is considered for the spruce hardwood because it is assumed that harvesting takes place in a remote forest location where accessibility and communication are difficult [39]. No camping cost is considered for the agricultural residues because of the easy access to the harvesting area [25]. To estimate the present production cost of the renewable diesel and gasoline, a discounted cast flow (DCF) analysis was developed with an internal rate of return of 10% for a 20-year plant life. Table 5 includes the inflation factor used for the different cost components. After capital cost, operating cost plays an important role in the analysis. Variable operating costs include raw material cost, maintenance cost, operating labor cost, plant overhead cost, general and administrative costs, operating charges, water disposal cost, and utilities. In the H2 purchase scenario, raw materials include biomass, H2 purchase cost, nitrogen, sand, and upgrading catalysts, and in the H2 production scenario, raw materials include biomass, nitrogen, sand, and upgrading and reforming catalysts. The cost of the reforming catalyst used in the analysis for the hydrogen production scenario is significantly lower than the purchase cost of hydrogen from the external source, which uses natural gas as the feedstock. Therefore, the raw material cost for the H2 purchase scenario is higher than in the H2 production scenario. Table 6 lists biomass yield and delivery costs. The biomass delivery cost has two components, field cost and biomass transportation cost. The harvesting method is different for woody biomass than for agricultural residue and is described in detail elsewhere [38,40]. Of the feedstocks considered, harvesting costs are lowest for woody biomass because of the high yield per hectare, and yield is lowest for wheat straw. The lower yield raises the transportation cost. In the H2 production scenario, there is a cost for the catalyst used in the hydrotreaters, hydrocracker, reformer, and shift reactors; in the H2 purchase scenario, however, the reforming catalyst cost is excluded. The lifetime of the catalyst is considered to be 1 year; after that, it is replaced. The catalyst costs used in the hydroprocessing unit were derived from Wright et al. [17] and in the reformer from Zhu et al. [33]. The costs of electricity, nitrogen, H2, and sand used in our cost analysis are, respectively, 0.056 $ kWh−1 [41], 0.04/100 $ g−1 [42], 0.74 $ kg−1 [34], and 7.8 $ t−1 [43]. To run a 2000 t d−1 capacity plant continuously, the number of employees (including laborers and supervisor) is assumed to be 13 and 18, respectively, per shift, for the H2 purchase and production scenarios, and three shifts per day are assumed. Operating charges for the plant are assumed to be 25% of the total labor cost and plant overhead to be 50% of the sum of the operating and the maintenance costs [25,39]. Table 5 lists the operating charges included in the analysis. All costs are reported in 2016 US dollars. For the analysis, renewable diesel and gasoline are considered the main products with biochar as the byproduct. Diesel and gasoline are separated in a fraction column after the hydroprocessing operation. To estimate the production cost of individual renewable fuels, we assumed that diesel cost is a function of gasoline cost (diesel cost = gasoline cost +0.05 $ L−1) for the specific location [44]. We also assumed that the biochar can be sold at a price of 100 $ t−1 on a dry basis [45]."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Results of experimental work on fast pyrolysis in fluidized bed reactor,"4.1 Results of experimental work on fast pyrolysis in fluidized bed reactor 4.1.1 Experimental results on the effects of temperature on pyrolysis yield Fig. 4 (a), (b), and (c) show the influence of temperature on the fast pyrolysis yield of spruce, corn stover, and wheat straw, respectively, in a fluidized bed reactor. As each figure shows, bio-oil yield increases with increases in temperature and, at a certain point, decreases. The temperature at which maximum bio-oil yield is achieved differs by feedstock. The temperatures are 490 °C, 460 °C, and 460 °C and the maximum bio-oil yields are 64%, 49%, and 55% by weight for spruce, wheat straw, and corn stover, respectively. Gas yield increases and biochar yield decreases with increases in temperature for all the feedstocks. The product distribution trends for all the feedstocks are similar; this is because they share the same biomass decomposition kinetics. At low temperatures, activation energy is not sufficient to break the solid feedstock to pyrolysis vapor. Thus, biochar yield is highest at low temperatures and some unconverted biomass is found with the biochar. However, with increases in temperature, bio-oil yield increases because of increased volatile compounds in the pyrolysis vapor from the fast pyrolysis process. With further increases in temperature (for spruce, to 490 °C, and for corn stover and wheat straw, to 460 °C), bio-oil yield decreases because of the secondary cracking reaction of the pyrolysis vapor, which forms more low molecular weight non-condensable gases (see Fig. 4). The bio-oil yield for wheat straw is lowest because of its low carbon content and high oxygen percentage. These same product distribution trends have been reported by other researchers [46–49]. 4.1.2 Experimental results on the effects of particle size on pyrolysis yield The effects of particle size distribution on bio-oil yield were also studied for each feedstock at a particular temperature. The temperatures, selected based on the highest bio-oil yield, are 460 °C for corn stover and wheat straw and 490 °C for spruce. Three particle size distributions were selected: 0.125–0.425 mm, 0.425–1 mm, and 1–2 mm. The average diameter of the smaller particles (0.275 mm) is one-fifth the size of the larger ones (1.5 mm). Fig. 5 shows the differences in bio-oil and biochar yield with changes in particle size distribution. At a low particle size, maximum bio-oil yield is attained, and, with increases in particle size, the weight of the bio-oil yield drops. The drop in yield with increased particle size is related to heat transfer conditions during the pyrolysis process. The energy required to heat the entire biomass particle in a particular time is related to its heat transfer coefficient, which is related to particle thickness. The smaller particles easily convert to pyrolysis vapor but the pyrolysis vapor yield is lower for the large particles. Bio-oil yield for spruce, corn stover, and wheat straw decrease from 67% to 59%, 57.5% to 49%, and 52% to 44.3% by weight with particle size increases of 0.125–0.425 mm, 0.425–1 mm and 1–2 mm, respectively [13,50,51]. It takes more time for heat to transfer from the particle surface to the center for big particles than for small ones, and since fast pyrolysis has a very short residence time, solid biomass cannot decompose to gas in that time. Bio-char yield thus increases with increased particle size, as shown Fig. 5, and is highest for large particles. 4.1.3 Experimental results on the bio-oil characterization Bio-oil is a complex mixture of organic compounds, mainly acids, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, ketones, sugars, phenols, phenol derivatives, etc., that are formed by the decomposition of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Table 7 shows the percentage of different compounds identified by the GC/MS in the bio-oil from different biomass feedstocks (spruce at 490 °C and corn stover and wheat straw at 460 °C); these figures were used for the process simulation. The main acid compounds identified are acetic acid and carboxylic acid. Phenol and phenol-derived compounds are present in large portions compared to other organic compounds. These compounds are formed by depolymerization of the lignin compounds, which present in a ring form. Generally, cellulose decomposes to form mainly ketones and aldehyde through condensation reactions [52]. The amounts of organic compounds vary depending on the percentages of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin content in the feedstock."
10,Techno-economic model,"4.2 Techno-economic model 4.2.1 Differences in renewable diesel cost as a function of capital cost (H2 production and H2 purchase scenario) Table 8 lists the main costs in the production of transportation fuel through fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing technology from three biomass feedstocks (spruce, corn stover, and wheat straw) for a plant capacity of 2000 t d−1. All three feedstocks were assessed in the H2 production scenario; however, only spruce hardwood was assessed in the H2 purchase scenario. From Table 8, it can be observed that cost of renewable diesel is lowest for spruce, H2 production scenario. Therefore, the authors wanted to see how the cost of renewable diesel differs in the hydrogen purchase scenario. A significant capital cost contribution comes from the reforming unit in the H2 production scenario (as shown in Table 8 and Fig. 6 .); therefore, the authors wanted to analyze the trade-offs between the H2 production and H2 purchase scenario for the renewable diesel production cost. This is the reason behind the assessment of the hydrogen purchase scenario for spruce hardwood. The installed equipment cost for the H2 production unit in the H2 production scenario is almost 100 M$ more than in the H2 purchase scenario. In the spruce hardwood hydrogen production scenario, the pretreatment and pyrolysis unit, hydrotreating unit, hydrocracking and fractionation unit, electricity generation unit, and H2 production unit make up 19%, 18%, 33%, 15%, and 15%, respectively, of the total purchased equipment cost; this cost breakdown is shown in Fig. 6. The hydrocracking and fractionation unit cost is highest because this unit consists of one hydrocracker and several fractionation columns to separate the flue gas, diesel, and gasoline. In the H2 purchase scenario analysis, electricity production and H2 production unit costs are not considered; the total equipment cost thus falls by 30%, thereby reducing capital costs and renewable production cost from 1.11 $ L−1 (in the H2 production scenario) to 0.98 $ L−1 for spruce. The installed capital costs are 322.7 M$ and 300.6 M$, respectively, for corn stover and wheat straw in the H2 production scenario for a 2000 dry t d−1 plant and the corresponding renewable diesel production costs are 1.19 $ L−1 and 1.27 $ L−1. Fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing plant capital costs are lower for agricultural residues than for woody biomass for two reasons. The first is that agricultural residue feedstock has a low moisture content and so less feedstock is handled in the biomass pretreatment unit. The second reason is a lower bio-oil yield from the pyrolyzer for agricultural residues. The lower capital cost lowers the cost of the hydrotreaters, hydrocracker, and fractionation columns because they handle lower capacities of bio-oil than generated from spruce hardwood. Annual operating costs are 170.6 M$, 133 M$, and 123 M$, respectively, for spruce, corn stover, and straw in the H2 production scenario. 4.2.2 Cost distribution of renewable diesel cost Fig. 7 shows the operating cost distribution of renewable diesel for spruce (H2 purchase and production scenarios), corn stover (H2 production scenario), and wheat straw (H2 production scenario) for a plant capacity of 2000 t d−1. Renewable diesel production costs for spruce hardwood are 1.11 $ L−1 and 0.98 $ L−1, respectively, in the H2 production and purchase scenarios. In both scenarios, raw material cost contributed significantly to the cost of renewable diesel, followed by capital cost, maintenance cost, utility cost, and camping cost. Raw material costs are 0.52 $ L−1 and 0.49 $ L−1 in the H2 purchase and the H2 production scenarios, respectively. In the H2 production scenario, the raw material cost is low because there are no H2 purchase costs, but capital costs are high because of the costs to install a H2 reforming plant and an electricity generation plant. The capital costs are 0.15 $ L−1 and 0.10 $ L−1, respectively, in the H2 production and the purchase scenarios. The utility cost is significantly lower in the H2 purchase scenario (0.05 $ L−1) than in the H2 production scenario (0.09 $ L−1) because less equipment is needed. For this analysis, the biochar produced in the fast pyrolysis process is considered revenue instead of an energy source; in other words, the electricity produced in the power generation unit is consumed in the plant and there is no excess for revenue. Plant maintenance and overhead costs are high in the H2 production scenario because more equipment is needed during operation. For corn stover and wheat straw, the renewable diesel production costs' present values are 1.19 $ L−1 and 1.27 $ L−1, respectively, in the hydrogen production scenario. Both are higher than the renewable diesel production costs in both spruce scenarios because of the higher transportation fuel yield. For corn stover and wheat straw, the raw material cost makes up a significant portion of the renewable diesel production cost, 0.47 $ L−1 and 0.56 $ L−1, respectively. These costs are higher than for spruce wood because of the lower agricultural residue yield per hectare than woody biomass (see Table 6). As stated earlier, there is no camping cost in agricultural residue harvesting, as the fields are easily accessible. Capital costs are 0.19 $ L−1and 0.21 $ L−1 and maintenance costs are 0.12 $ L−1and 0.13 $ L−1, respectively, for corn stover and straw. Cost ranges are explained in more detail in the sensitivity analysis discussion."
11,Effects of byproduct selling price on renewable diesel production cost,"4.3 Effects of byproduct selling price on renewable diesel production cost To make the pyrolysis process competitive with conventional fossil fuel technologies, it is necessary to identify the value of biochar as a byproduct, and making it marketable will enhance the feasibility of this process. In this study, an attempt is made to understand the effects of byproduct costs on the production cost of renewable diesel. Fig. 6 (a) and Table 9 show differences in renewable diesel cost with a biochar selling price of 0 to 500 $ t−1 on a dry basis [45]. The diesel production cost decreases with increases in the selling price of biochar. For both the hydrogen production and purchase scenarios of spruce wood, the renewable diesel cost fell by almost 15% when biochar cost increased from 0 to 500 $ t−1. However, for wheat straw and corn stover, renewable diesel costs fell by 29.7% and 23.3%, respectively, when biochar cost increased from 0 to 500 $ t−1, as agricultural residues produce more biochar than woody biomass, which increases the biochar revenue and which is reflected in the renewable diesel cost. Therefore, the byproduct cost has a significant effect on the production cost of the main products."
12,Sensitivity analysis,"4.4 Sensitivity analysis Fig. 8 (b), (c), (d) and (e) show the economic and process parameter sensitivities of spruce (in the H2 production and purchase scenarios) and of agricultural residues (in the H2 production scenario) on the production cost of renewable diesel in terms of present worth. All the parameters were changed by ±20%. The cost of renewable diesel in $ L−1 ranges from 0.82 to 1.22, 0.93–1.38, 0.99–1.48, and 1.07–1.59, respectively, in the spruce H2 purchase scenario, the spruce H2 production scenario, the corn stover H2 production scenario, and the wheat straw H2 production scenario. Of all the parameters, bio-oil yield is most sensitive to the production cost of the renewable diesel for all the feedstocks for both the H2 production and the purchase scenario. Optimizing the process conditions (i.e., reactor design, temperature, and particle size) could increase the bio-oil yield, which would reduce production costs. The diesel cost fell to 0.82 $ L−1 from 1.22 $ L−1 and 0.99 $ L−1 from 1.38 $ L−1 in the H2 purchase and the production scenarios, respectively, when bio-oil yield was increased by 20% for spruce feedstock. When bio-oil yields for corn stover and wheat straw were increased by 20%, the renewable diesel costs fell from 1.19 to 0.99 $ L−1and 1.27 to 1.07 $ L−1, respectively. After bio-oil yield, raw material cost is the most influential parameter. When raw material costs were increased by 20%, diesel costs increased from 0.98 to 1.08 $ L−1 and 1.11 to 1.20 $ L−1, respectively, for the spruce feedstock H2 purchase and the H2 production scenarios. For corn stover and straw, renewable diesel cost also increases with an increase in raw material cost. The other influential parameters are the internal rate of return (IRR) and capital cost. The cost of renewable diesel increases with an increase in these parameters. By increasing the IRR by 20%, the $ L−1 cost of renewable diesel increases by 3%, 4%, 5.4%, and 5%, respectively, in the spruce H2 purchase scenario, the spruce H2 production scenario, the corn stover H2 production scenario, and the wheat straw H2 production scenario. Capital cost and renewable diesel cost are directly proportional to each other."
13,Net energy ratio analysis,"4.5 Net energy ratio analysis By definition, the net energy ratio (NER) is the ratio between the energy output in terms of renewable energy to the energy input from non-renewable resources [32,53–55]. To calculate the NER for fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing technology, the following operations are considered: biomass cultivation, harvesting, biomass transportation to the plant, the fast pyrolysis process, reforming, power generation, and hydroprocessing. In the H2 purchase scenario, H2 reforming and the power generation unit are not included. The NER is the ratio of efficient renewable energy production to the consumption of energy from a fossil fuel. For this analysis, diesel and electricity are assumed as the energy input from conventional sources. By definition, if the NER of a process is greater than 1, then the process is considered energy efficient. Specifically, for new technology for renewable resources, which are economically very demanding, an NER greater than one is required to see any energy and emissions benefits. In this study, the NERs for spruce, corn stover, and wheat straw were estimated to be 2.16, 1.5, and 1.16, respectively, for fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing technology in the H2 production scenario. For all three feedstocks, the NER shows that less fossil fuel is consumed than the energy produced through renewable energy. Of all the biomass considered, spruce is found to have the highest NER; this is because it yields more transportation fuel and consumes less diesel during harvesting than agricultural feedstock. These NER numbers were compared with published results for similar pathways and different feedstocks and are in good agreement. For example, Miller and Kumar analyzed the NER for canola and camelina feedstock for the production of renewable diesel and reported NERs from 1 to 2.3 [32]. The NER ranges are a result of feedstock type, oil extraction method, and upgrading technology. Wong et al. also did an NER analysis for renewable diesel production and reported NER values of 1.55 to 1.9 depending on the feedstock type [56]. The output energy from biomass feedstock fast pyrolysis and upgrading technology is higher than the fossil fuel energy input, which helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
14,Comparison of renewable diesel production costs with published values,"4.6 Comparison of renewable diesel production costs with published values Because of their lower costs and availability, petro-fuels from crude oil are more attractive than renewable diesel to investors and end users. Renewable diesel from fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing technology has a comparatively higher capital cost than diesel from conventional methods. Further research and development along with government support is needed for large commercial-scale development of the technology. Production costs of transportation fuels from fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing reported in the literature range from 0.64 to 1.3 $ L−1, depending on the biomass [4,19]. Recently, Li et al. studied different fractions of bio-oil and upgraded them to gasoline and diesel fractions through hydroprocessing for red oak feedstock and reported a production cost of 0.8 $ L−1 [57]. Following their sensitivity study, they found that feedstock cost, capital cost, and product yield are more sensitive than other factors to transportation cost. Differences in the production cost of the upgraded biofuel are due to location factor and product yield. To the best of our knowledge, there is no Canadian techno-economic assessment study of upgrading bio-oil from different feedstocks and comparing the production costs of the end products. In this study, we looked at three Canadian biomass feedstocks and two scenarios (H2 purchase and production) to estimate the present value of renewable diesel and gasoline. The production costs of renewable diesel are 0.98 $ L-1, 1.11 $ L−1, 1.19 $ L−1, and 1.27 $ L−1, respectively, for the spruce H2 purchase scenario, the spruce H2 production scenario, the corn stover H2 production scenario, and the wheat straw H2 production scenario for a plant capacity of 2000 dry td−1. Finally, the production cost of renewable diesel found in this analysis was compared with the production cost of conventional diesel. After provincial taxes and the market margin are deducted from the rack price, the production costs of petro-diesel and gasoline were calculated to be 0.48–0.68 $ L−1 and 0.43–0.6 $ L−1, respectively, from January 2017 to November 2017 [44]. The price of conventional fuel changed considerably because of market conditions and is highly unpredictable. The cost calculated for renewable diesel in this study is higher than the conventional diesel cost, and the cost of renewable diesel from the spruce H2 purchase scenario is at the higher end of the petro-diesel cost. This analysis considered a standalone pyrolysis and hydroprocessing unit. The cost of renewable fuel could be reduced if this unit can be combined with an existing refinery where a H2 production unit is already established. This option can be explored and more research is required in the technical aspects of the hydroprocessing technology to make this process real."
15,Conclusion,"This study performed experimental work on the production of bio-oil from three different Canadian biomass feedstocks. The experimental data, along data from the literature, were used to develop techno-economic models to assess the use of three biomass feedstocks to produce renewable diesel and gasoline through fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing technology for a plant capacity of 2000 t d−1. The production cost of renewable diesel ranges from 0.98 to 1.27 $ L−1 depending on the feedstock type in the hydrogen production scenarios. The sensitivity analysis showed that bio-oil yield is most sensitive to renewable diesel production cost, followed by raw material cost, capital cost, and IRR. The raw material cost is approximately 53% of the production cost in the spruce hydrogen purchase scenario, whereas in the hydrogen production scenario, raw material costs range from 40 to 44% of the production cost of renewable diesel for all the feedstocks. To make the process cost competitive with existing refinery technology, more attention should be paid to reducing both biomass feedstock and capital costs of the whole pathway. The plant location and collaboration with an existing refinery could help to commercialize this technology. In this study, an attempt is made to investigate differences in the production cost of renewable diesel as a function of selling price of biochar, which ranges from 0 to 500 $ t−1 on a dry basis. With an increase in the selling price of biochar, the renewable diesel cost decreases significantly. With an increase in cost from 0 to 500 $ t−1, the renewable diesel cost falls from 1.02 to 0.85, 1.14 to 0.98, 1.25 to 0.95, and 1.36 to 0.95 $ L−1, respectively, in the spruce hydrogen purchase scenario, spruce hydrogen production scenario, corn stover hydrogen production scenario and wheat straw hydrogen production scenario. Therefore, consideration of biochar as a byproduct could improve the economic feasibility of the pyrolysis and hydroprocessing technology. Hydroprocessing technology is well understood in the petroleum refinery sector, but thus far it is not completely commercialized nor mature enough for bio-oil upgrading technology. To estimate the capital cost for the analysis, the authors relied on assumptions, lab-scale experimental data, and the literature, as real time plant data is not available. It is necessary to overcome these challenges to make this technology competitive and cost effective with existing conventional transportation fuel industries. Therefore, the impacts of the major challenges were investigated in the sensitivity analysis to understand the effect of process and financial parameters on the production cost of renewable diesel. We conclude that it is important to upgrade this technology from lab-scale to pilot and small-scale commercial plants, and future techno-economic studies are required to understand the implications of cost estimates."
