0,Introduction,
1,Hydrogen: the fuel of the future,"1.1 Hydrogen: the fuel of the future As the world population grows and emerging economies continue to develop, the global appetite for energy is expected to continue to expand. Given this projected exponential increase, proven fossil fuel reserves are likely to be depleted by the end of this century [1]. An even more pressing concern is the threat of irreversible climate change resulting from greenhouse gas emissions associated with the combustion of these fossil fuels. It would be socially and economically beneficial to act immediately to reduce greenhouse gas emissions rather than to permit business as usual and then adapt to the consequences [2]. Technologies such as wind power and solar photovoltaics have demonstrated that a renewable, low-carbon future for electricity generation is possible. However, two thirds of the global primary energy market requires fuel, not electricity. Molecular hydrogen (H2) is the cleanest available fuel; the only combustion products being heat energy and water. In addition, H2 is also the lightest and the most efficient fuel [3]. H2 therefore has the potential to become the sustainable fuel of the future, but only if it can be produced by a sustainable process."
2,Biophotolytic H2 production,"1.2 Biophotolytic H2 production The aim of the Solar Hydrogen Project at Imperial College London is to produce H2 from sunlight and water [4]. This is achieved with the help of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (C. reinhardtii), which possesses the metabolic machinery to produce H2 under anaerobic conditions. In the first stage of this biophotolytic H2 production process, the photosystem II (PS II) reaction centre, located within the chloroplasts of C. reinhardtii cells, captures the energy carried by photons and uses it to split water into oxygen molecules, protons and electrons. Under aerobic conditions, these photosynthetic protons and electrons are principally used for carbon dioxide fixation in the Calvin Cycle, which leads to the production of glucose, the energy store of the algal cell [5]. In the absence of oxygen, the electrons are transported by the protein ferredoxin to the iron-only hydrogenase enzyme, which catalyses the process of proton–electron recombination to produce H2. In addition, the hydrogenase enzyme also receives a supply of reductants from the degradation of organic molecules such as starch [6]. The main drawback of biophotolytic H2 production is that the function of the hydrogenase enzyme is strongly inhibited in the presence of oxygen and the process is therefore self-limiting [7]. Depriving the algae of sulphur has proven to be the most effective way of achieving significant and prolonged H2 production [8]. Sulphur-deprivation (S-deprivation) of C. reinhardtii diminishes its ability to repair the D1 protein within PSII, resulting in a gradual decrease in PSII activity and the associated oxygen production rate [9]. Since the oxygen consumption rate by respiration remains unaffected, the algae soon begin to consume more oxygen than they are producing, and eventually metabolically bring themselves into the stage of anaerobic H2 production [10]."
3,Nutrient-controlled H2 production,"1.3 Nutrient-controlled H2 production One limitation of the S-deprivation method of H2 production is the requirement to spatially and temporally separate the algal growth and H2 production stages. In a typical experiment, C. reinhardtii cells are grown aerobically, in the presence of sulphur, in one photobioreactor (PBR), the algal biomass is then extracted by centrifugation, re-suspended in a sulphur-deplete medium and placed in a second PBR to initiate H2 production [8,11–14]. The aim of this paper is to show that the growth and H2 production stages are able to take place in a single PBR without the need for centrifugation or any other separation process. This has been achieved by measuring and controlling the sulphur concentration in the algal medium. The parameters of the biophotolytic H2 production process have been successfully modelled by response surface methodology [15], s-systems formulation [16] and flux balance analysis [17] techniques. This theoretical work provides the basis for understanding the nutrient uptake by C. reinhardtii cells. The paper will also draw on the lessons learned during sulphur re-addition experiments, which have been used to extend the duration of biophotolytic H2 production [18–20]. We have built on this work by experimentally investigating sulphate and acetate uptake rates under different illumination conditions and in different PBRs, with the ultimate aim of being able to initiate spontaneous H2 production in any of these systems."
4,Materials and methods,
5,Photobioreactors,"2.1 Photobioreactors 2.1.1 Stirred-tank and vertical-column Four different PBR geometries were used in this study: stirred-tank, vertical-column, tubular and flat-plate [21]. The Solar Biofuels consortium 250 ml stirred-tank PBRs [21] have been used to analyse C. reinhardtii growth under different light regimes. Algae in the stirred-tank PBRs grew under heterotrophic conditions, with acetate in the growth medium acting as the predominant carbon source. Plankton Light Reactor vertical-column 2 L PBRs from Aqua Medic were used to grow C. reinhardtii stock cultures for use in future experiments. The vertical-column reactors were agitated by means of an air-lift system so that the algae grew mixotrophically, with carbon dioxide and acetate as the carbon sources. The stirred-tank and vertical-column PBRs had two major experimental limitations, namely that only a fixed light intensity was available (42.5 W m−2 in the vertical-column reactor and approximately 25.0 W m−2 in the stirred-tank reactors) and that all concentration and optical density (OD) measurements had to be carried out by sampling. 2.1.2 Tubular The Sartorius Biostat PBR 2S was used as the tubular reactor of choice for this study. This 3 L reactor features a tubular helix, where the algae are exposed to a large illumination surface area, located around a central vessel housing a thermocouple as well as pH, dissolved oxygen (pO2) and OD probes for in situ measurements. The main limitation of the Sartorius PBR is that the complexity of its design, together with the nature of its peristaltic pump, making it very difficult to minimise H2 leaks through diffusive losses from the reactor [4]. As a result, the Sartorius PBR has been used primarily to measure C. reinhardtii growth kinetics under different light intensities. The Sartorius PBR has been run as an open system to encourage mixotrophic algal growth. 2.1.3 Flat-plate The Imperial College flat-plate reactor has been specifically designed to enable quick measurement of the key parameters in the biohydrogen production process [22]. The reactor is characterised by cool-white non-heating illumination provided by an LED array, an excellent surface-to-volume ratio and the presence of a thermocouple, and pH and pO2 probes for in situ measurements. Agitation is provided by means of an air-lift system similar to the one used in the vertical-column reactor; during H2 production, the agitation loop is closed and the trapped gas is circulated around by means of a diaphragm pump. OD is monitored through the use of a calibrated photodiode, which measures the attenuation of LED light by the algal culture. The flat-plate reactor is hydrogen-tight and it is equipped with a membrane-inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS) system used to measure H2 production rates and yields. Nutrient uptake rates (sulphate and acetate) in all PBRs have been measured by extracting 8 ml samples at regular time intervals (usually twice per day) and processing them using the relevant analysis technique."
6,Measuring instruments,"2.2 Measuring instruments 2.2.1 Sartorius tubular PBR inventory A Pt100 Type 25-3 thermocouple was used to measure the temperature in the Sartorius PBR and feed this data back to the Sartorius control tower. Temperature was maintained at 25 °C by means of a water bath in the double-layered central vessel. The Hamilton Easyferm Plus K8 160 pH electrode was used to measure the activity of hydrogen ions surrounding this probe. The Oxyferm FDA 160 oxygen tension probe, also from Hamilton, was used to measure the pO2 by means of a Clark electrode suspended in oxylyte electrolyte. The Sartorius Fundalux II OD probe, containing an LED that operates in the 870–910 nm wavelength range, was used to measure the optical thickness of the algal culture. 2.2.2 Imperial College flat-plate PBR inventory The temperature in the flat-plate PBR was measured using a K-type thermocouple from Omega. Two probes from Consort were used: the SP10T pH electrode and the SZ10T galvanic pO2 electrode. OD was measured using a photodiode operating with an absorption bandwidth of 650–700 nm. All the measurements were recorded using a National Instruments data-logging and control system based around the National Instrument Compact RIO processor and running LabView software [22]. 2.2.3 MIMS Membrane-inlet mass spectrometry is an analytical technique used to measure in situ concentrations of dissolved gasses or volatile organic compound in aqueous solutions [23]. A compact quadrupole Pfeiffer Vacuum Prisma mass spectrometer running Windows Quadstar 422 software was used. Gaseous species dissolved in the liquid phase of the flat-plate PBR pervaporate through a thin polydimethylsiloxane membrane (permeable to all the gasses involved, including H2) and are transported by the argon carrier gas to the inlet of the mass spectrometer. The H2 pervaporation rate at the specified membrane dimensions was calculated to be 9.3 ml/h [22]. Since this value is higher than typical wild-type C. reinhardtii H2 production rates [24,25], it was possible to use MIMS to directly and continuously observe the H2 production rate of the algae. 2.2.4 Calibrations The pH probes were calibrated using three buffer solutions with known pH values (pH 4.01, pH 7.00 and pH 9.12). The pO2 probes were calibrated to 0% oxygen in nitrogen-saturated water, 20.9% in air-saturated water and 100% in oxygen-saturated water. The OD probe reading was autozeroed in distilled water. The photodiode was calibrated using spectrophotometric measurements. MIMS was calibrated in the gas-phase by correlating the mass spectrometer ion current output with H2 flow rates using a digital mass flow controller from Porter."
7,Medium,"2.3 Medium 2.3.1 TAP C. reinhardtii cultures are known to grow well in the tris–acetate phosphate (TAP) growth medium [26]. The TAP medium provides all the necessary nutrients for algal growth (carbon, nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus and trace metals) but it also contains expensive ingredients such as acetate, ammonium and phosphate [13]. Optimising the use of acetate is important for limiting biohydrogen production costs, particularly in large-scale systems [27]. Since S-deprivation induces the onset of anaerobic H2 production, controlling sulphate levels is an intuitive way of controlling H2 production. The TAP medium has an initial pH of 7.0 and it is overloaded with all key nutrients except for acetate, which normally runs out in the first three days of algal growth [28]. 2.3.2 TAP-S The most practical way of inducing H2 production is by replacing the sulphur-replete TAP medium with TAP-S, its sulphur-deplete counterpart [8]. This is typically achieved by replacing the sulphate salts in the TAP medium with their chloride derivatives to make TAP-S and exchanging the algal growth medium by centrifugation. The concentrations of the key components of the TAP and TAP-S media are shown in Table 1 . 2.3.3 Modifications It is possible to make other small variations to the TAP medium without reducing algal growth rates. For example, it is possible to reduce the concentrations of sulphate and ammonium salts in the TAP medium, as long as these changes do not result in the deprivation of one of these key nutrients. It is also possible to change the concentration of acetate if it is matched by an equivalent change in the concentration of the buffer solutions (tris and phosphate solutions) and as long as the medium is titrated back to pH 7.0 using sodium hydroxide. The 5xTAP* medium (Table 1) has been overloaded with acetate (five times the standard TAP concentration) to investigate acetate uptake kinetics during the entire algal growth stage. The increase in the acetate concentration has been balanced by an increase in the concentration of the phosphate buffer. The TAP12 medium has been prepared to facilitate nutrient-controlled H2 production in the flat-plate reactor at a light intensity of 12 W m−2 (Table 1) – the acetate and sulphate concentrations have been optimised for these conditions; this will be demonstrated later in the Results and Discussion section."
8,Analysis techniques,"2.4 Analysis techniques 2.4.1 Spectrophotometry Spectrophotometry was used to determine the OD of an algal culture by light scattering. OD, measured in absorbance units (AU), has a linear correlation with the chlorophyll content and the algal cell count of that culture (results not shown). A Lambda 40 UV/Vis Spectrometer from Perkin–Elmer Instruments running the UV WinLab software was used to measure OD at the algal PSII absorption peak of 663 nm [22]. The OD reading at this photosynthetic wavelength maximum is the most responsive measurement to changes in the optical thickness of the culture [22]. At 663 nm, 1 AU is equal to 14.0 mg/l of chlorophyll, or approximately 3.5 million algal cells. Algal samples were analysed in a 1.5 ml cuvette and the instrument was autozeroed with the light scattering measurement from a cuvette filled with deionised water. Spectrophotometric OD measurements were also used to calibrate the flat-plate reactor photodiode for experiments at specific light intensities. 2.4.2 Ion chromatography Ion chromatography (IC) was carried out using the 882 Compact IC Plus instrument with an 863 Compact Autosampler from Metrohm running the MagIC Net software. The technique used the Metrosep A Supp 10 separation column, which is capable of analysing compounds whose concentrations differ widely. The concentrations of compounds coming off the column were measured by means of a conductivity detector. The sodium-based anion solution (liquid phase) consisted of 3.2 mM Na2CO3, 1.0 mM NaHCO3 and 5.0 μM NaClO4. Deionised water was used as the rinse and 0.1 M sulphuric acid as the regenerator. The liquid phase was pumped through the instrument using a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Algal samples were spun down in a mini-centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 10 min: the purified medium was used for IC and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the algal pellet was discarded. Samples of 25 μl were injected into the IC instrument. The anion concentrations corresponded to the area occupied by their respective peaks. These areas were calibrated against concentration using CertiPUR Anion Multi-Element Standards from Merck at concentrations of 1 ppm, 10 ppm, 50 ppm, 100 ppm and 200 ppm (1 ppm = 1 mg/l). The anions coming off the column included phosphate ( P O 4 3 − ) and sulphate ( S O 4 2 − ) with a retention time of 12.2 min and 22.0 min respectively. It was subsequently determined that the phosphate concentrations present in the algal growth medium were not sufficiently high to be tracked by this technique. IC was therefore primarily used to measure the sulphate uptake during algal growth. 2.4.3 High-performance liquid chromatography HPLC was performed using the Hewlett Packard Series 1050 instrument running HPCORE ChemStation software. The technique was based on a well-established procedure designed to investigate the concentration of fermentative products such as organic acids and alcohols [29]. The Aminex HPX-87H Ion Exchange Column from BioRad (HPLC Organic Acid Analysis Column) was used at a temperature of 58.0 °C together with a BioRad guard column. Compounds were detected by means of a UV detector operating at 210 nm. The liquid phase consisted of 4 mM sulphuric acid, which was peristaltically pumped through the column at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Having been spun down at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, 50 μl medium samples were injected into the instrument by means of an autosampler. HPLC was principally used to measure the acetate (CH3COO−) uptake during algal growth. A strong acetate peak was observed with a residence time of 15.1 min and the peak area was calibrated against acetate concentration using 20,000 ppm, 5000 ppm 1000 ppm and 200 ppm standards prepared from 99.99% pure acetic acid."
9,Data-fitting,"2.5 Data-fitting 2.5.1 Interpretation A logistic (sigmoid) function has been frequently and effectively used to fit kinetic parameters to algal growth and nutrient uptake data [30,31]. When modelling growth kinetics, OD may be described as a function of time using Equation (1). In this formulation, the parameter K represents the maximum OD obtained in a particular experiment. The parameter t 0 is the inflexion point of the function, which may be normalised to compare growth rates of algal cultures with diverse starting ODs and different start-up rates. The most important parameter is r, the specific growth rate of the culture. Equation (2) may be used to convert r to the doubling time (T d), the most common unit for describing algal growth. By differentiating Equation (1) with respect to time, it is possible to determine the gradient at t 0 (Equation (3)), which is the maximum growth rate (r max) of the culture. (1) OD ( t ) = K / ( 1 + exp ( − r ∗ ( t − t 0 ) ) ) (2) T d = ln ( 2 ) / r (3) r max = ( K ∗ r ) / 4 In the case of nutrient uptake, an inverted form of the logistic function, shown in Equation (4), has been fitted to experimental data in order to reflect the observed decrease in nutrient concentration. In this scenario, K becomes the total quantity of a nutrient that has been consumed and r becomes the corresponding consumption/uptake rate. C(t) is the time-dependent nutrient concentration function while C f is the final nutrient concentration following the experiment. The final nutrient concentration can be calculated using the pre-determined initial nutrient concentration, C i and the total quantity of nutrient consumed, K (Equation (5)). (4) C ( t ) = K / ( 1 + exp ( r ∗ ( t − t 0 ) ) ) + C f (5) C f = C i − K 2.5.2 Modelling Fitting a logistic curve to discrete experimental data requires the simultaneous optimisation of three independent parameters, a task that has been studied extensively in the field of ecology [32]. The accepted procedure is to assign a random initial value to K, then minimise the total least squared error in r and t 0. This assigns the correct shape to the logistic curve and K is subsequently recovered by linear optimisation. Figs. 1–3a standardise the inflection time t 0 to 60 h to enable a more effective comparison of algal growth and nutrient uptake curves at different light intensities."
10,Sulphur-deprivation,"2.6 Sulphur-deprivation Centrifugation and dilution are accepted methods for causing sulphur-deprivation in C. reinhardtii [8,33]. Nutrient control is the novel sulphur-deprivation technique that will be developed in this paper. The details of each procedure are given below. 2.6.1 Centrifugation The S-deprivation process has traditionally been initiated by centrifugation [7]. The algae were first grown in TAP medium until the required chlorophyll content has been obtained; approximately 20 mg/l of culture is sufficient for H2 production, but higher chlorophyll concentrations are desirable [13]. Once ready, the culture was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min and a dark green pellet of algal cells formed at the bottom of the centrifugation vessel. The TAP medium was discarded and the algae were washed with, and re-suspended in, TAP-S medium in the flat-plate reactor, where they proceeded to use up all available oxygen before commencing anaerobic H2 production. At least 20% of algal cells are lost during centrifugation, with additional cells damaged by the compressive stress endured during the process [11]. The centrifugation process is very time, energy and labour intensive, and it is therefore impractical for any large-scale application, thus motivating the need for a nutrient-controlled method of H2 production. 2.6.2 Dilution The dilution method is an alternative way of inducing S-deprivation. The aim is to dilute a small inoculum of algal cells (growing in TAP) in a large volume of TAP-S. The algae continue to grow until all sulphur is used up, at which point the oxygen consumption stage and subsequent H2 production begin. A dilution of 10% cells/TAP-S has been proven to work experimentally and has therefore been used in this study [33]. The main disadvantage of the dilution method is that the algae never achieve the high cell densities common to the centrifugation method due to the significantly lower number of PS II reaction centres. The H2 yield following dilution is approximately a factor of five lower than that of centrifugation [18]. On the other hand, dilution is a lot more energy efficient and does not require any specialised equipment. 2.6.3 Nutrient control The nutrient control method of H2 production has been developed in this study to optimise algal growth and maximise H2 production without the need to exchange media by centrifugation at any stage of the process. This has been achieved by accurately measuring algal growth rates and acetate and sulphate uptake rates under different growth conditions. The intention is that, given a set of conditions, it is possible to predict exactly how quickly the algae will grow and precisely how much acetate and sulphate they will require to get there. On this basis it is possible to set-up a growth medium (for example TAP12, Table 1) that will enable the sulphur to run out just as the algae attain their maximum OD, leading to spontaneous and effective H2 production."
11,Results and discussion,
12,Algal growth and nutrient uptake as functions of light intensity,"3.1 Algal growth and nutrient uptake as functions of light intensity 3.1.1 Application of the logistic model C. reinhardtii cc124 cells were grown in the Sartorius tubular reactor under six different light intensities: 15, 20, 25, 30, 45 and 60 W m−2. It has been previously shown that C. reinhardtii grows well within this light intensity range: there is a sufficiently high photon flux density to drive photosynthesis without causing photoinhibition [11,34]. The temperature (25 °C) and agitation rate (flow rate of 2200 ml/min) were constant for all experiments. Algal OD was measured by a spectrophotometer at 663 nm and correlated to the chlorophyll content of the culture. In the abundance of light and nutrients, the algae initially grow exponentially, with a doubling time of 6.2–11.1 h, depending on the light intensity. As the culture becomes thicker, algal cells increasingly inhibit their own access to illumination. This becomes a saturating factor that slows down the growth rate and eventually terminates growth. This behaviour has been accurately fitted by a logistic curve (Supplementary Fig. 1(a)). Residuals between the experimental data and the logistic fit have been minimised by the method of least squares and the largest remaining residual is only 1.7 mg/l Chl (4.8%). The application of the logistic model facilitates the extraction of two important kinetic parameters: the specific growth rate, r, and the maximum OD, K, which are both functions of light intensity. Sulphur and carbon, in the form of sulphate and acetate, are two of the key nutrients required for algal growth. The 5xTAP* growth medium used in these experiments has been overloaded with both sulphate and acetate in order to observe the entire nutrient uptake sequence. Sulphate concentrations have been measured by IC and acetate concentrations have been measured by HPLC. Since the concentration of both nutrients decreases as the algae grow, a reverse logistic function has been fitted to the experimental nutrient uptake data (Supplementary Fig. 1(b) for sulphate and Supplementary Fig. 1(c) for acetate). The reverse logistic function provides an excellent fit to the experimental data and enables the extraction of the kinetic parameters r, the specific nutrient uptake rate, and K, the total quantity of nutrient consumed. These parameters are functions of both the light intensity and of the algal growth rate. 3.1.2 Algal growth kinetics: light saturation The starting OD, age, circadian rhythm and reproductive phase of the starter culture used during an algal growth experiment are all difficult to control and may influence initial growth kinetics [31,35]. This results in a large temporal spread of experimental algal growth curves, with a wide variety of t 0 values. Since t 0 is by definition the mid-point of any logistic curve, we have chosen to standardise it to 60 h to enable a more effective comparison of algal growth curves at different light intensities, as shown in Fig. 1a. It is worth noting that since algae grow quicker at higher light intensities, the original value of t 0 tends to be lower under those conditions. The change required to standardise t 0 to 60 h is therefore greater, which creates certain artefacts in Fig. 1a; for example, the initial growth rates at high light intensities appear to be lower than at low light intensities, which is not actually the case. Increasing the light intensity has two main effects on C. reinhardtii growth kinetics. Firstly, the higher light intensity leads to a higher photosynthesis rate [5], increasing the overall algal growth rate. Secondly, the higher light intensity increases the overall irradiation incident on the culture, increasing the maximum OD. Plotting the specific algal growth rate against the light intensity (Fig. 1b) reveals a non-linear correlation between these two parameters. While the specific growth rate does increase with light intensity, it also saturates to a maximum value μ max. Previous work on algal growth kinetics has revealed that the growth rate not only saturates at μ max, but may also experience subsequent photoinhibition [36]. This behaviour has been summarised by the Aiba model (Equation (6)) [37]. (6) μ = ( μ max ∗ I ) / ( k s + I + ( I 2 / k i ) ) where μ – specific growth rate (also called r) [h−1] μ max – maximum specific growth rate [h−1] I – light intensity [W m−2] k s – light saturation term [W m−2] I 2/k i – photoinhibition term [W m−2] The parameters of the Aiba model were recovered in a similar way to their logistic model counterparts: k s and k i values were optimised using the method of least squares before μ max was recovered by linear optimisation. The algal growth rate was determined to saturate to a μ max of 0.154 h−1 (doubling time of 4.5 h) and no photoinhibition was observed in the 15–60 W m−2 light intensity range. The maximum OD did not show a statistically significant increase with light intensity; the linear correlation coefficient R was equal to 0.250 with a p-value of 0.633 (Fig. 1c). This result supports the claim [38] that the PBR geometry and hydrodynamic conditions have a more significant influence on the maximum OD than light intensity does. 3.1.3 Nutrient uptake kinetics: sulphate and acetate demand The sulphate and acetate uptake kinetics have been analysed in a similar way to the algal growth kinetics. Fig. 2a shows a comparison of the sulphate uptake reverse logistic curves at different light intensities, with t 0 standardised to 60 h and the initial sulphate concentration set to 48 mg/l (to offset any small variations in the initial sulphur concentration of the 5xTAP* medium). Sulphate uptake rates increase with light intensity and follow an Aiba model with a μ max of 0.231 (Fig. 2b), resulting in a similar curve as Fig. 2b for the specific algal growth rate. The total sulphate uptake appears to increase linearly with light intensity over the range studied (Fig. 2c: the correlation coefficient R is 0.626 with a p-value of 0.184). Sulphur is a key component of the photosynthetic mechanism of C. reinhardtii; it is required to repair the D1 protein, a major component of the PSII reaction centre [9]. Higher light intensities result in higher photosynthesis rates, increasing the frequency of the PSII repair cycle and therefore increasing both the sulphur uptake rate and the overall demand for sulphur. Fig. 3a shows a comparison of the acetate uptake reverse logistic curves at different light intensities, with t 0 standardised to 60 h and the initial sulphate concentration set to 5100 mg/l. The acetate uptake rate once again follows the Aiba light saturation model, with a μ max of 0.154 (Fig. 3b). However, the total acetate uptake appears to decrease linearly with light intensity (Fig. 3c: the correlation coefficient R is −0.893 with a p-value of 0.016). Acetate is the main source of carbon during C. reinhardtii growth [27]. Higher light intensities increase the algal growth rate, resulting in an increased demand for carbon and consequently an increase in the acetate uptake rate. At the same time, the increase in the rate of photosynthesis leads to higher rates of inorganic carbon fixation via the Calvin cycle [21]. A higher proportion of the overall carbon required by the algal cells can therefore be obtained from the ambient carbon dioxide via the Calvin cycle, resulting in a decrease in the total acetate uptake. This observation only holds if the algae are grown under these photomixotrophic conditions, in the presence of both carbon dioxide and acetate. The correlations in Figs. 2c and 3c may be used to design an algal growth medium to facilitate batch H2 production by nutrient control for any light intensity in the Sartorius reactor. For example, at a light intensity of 40 W m−2, a medium with an initial sulphate concentration of 29.4 mg/l and an initial acetate concentration of 3160 mg/l is required. Given these starting nutrient concentrations, the algae will use up all sulphate and acetate just as they obtain their maximum OD, leading to spontaneous H2 production by sulphur-deprivation. However, these relationships between light intensity and total nutrient uptake are specific to a particular PBR under a particular set of controlled conditions (temperature, agitation), and their application is therefore very limited. A reactor-independent correlation is required to develop a more flexible nutrient control technique."
13,Reactor-independent nutrient uptake,"3.2 Reactor-independent nutrient uptake In addition to the Sartorius tubular reactor, experiments were also carried out in stirred-tank, vertical-column and flat-plate reactors. An agglomeration of all the algal growth and nutrient uptake kinetic data is shown in Table 2 . Unlike the other PBRs, the stirred-tank reactor was a closed system and the algal growth conditions were consequently photoheterotrophic (acetate only). As a result, acetate uptake kinetics was different from those of the other PBRs and was excluded from further study. The stirred-tank PBR was operated under two light regimes: continuous illumination and 14 h/10 h light–dark cycles. Some of the quickest growth rates were observed in the flat-plate reactor, even though it was operated at a lower light intensity than the other reactors. This is because irradiation is incident on a flat reactor surface, and this PBR features a large surface-to-volume ratio and a turbulent agitation system, which maximise photon use efficiency [22]. As discussed previously, the specific sulphate and acetate uptake rates are determined by the rate of photosynthesis and are therefore functions of the specific algal growth rate. It follows from the same argument that the total sulphate and acetate uptake quantities are also functions of the specific algal growth rate. These correlations have been substantiated in Fig. 4 a and b for sulphate, and Fig. 4c and d for acetate. Both the sulphate uptake rate (Fig. 4a: the correlation coefficient R is 0.81 with a p-value of 0.01) and the total sulphate uptake (Fig. 4b: the correlation coefficient R is 0.74 with a p-value of 0.009) have been found to increase linearly with the algal growth rate. Correlations with a p-value lower than 0.010 are considered statistically significant. The random spread of different PBR data points above/below the linear regression line indicates that the correlation is reactor-independent. The acetate uptake rate increases linearly with algal growth rate (Fig. 4c: the correlation coefficient R is 0.97 with a p-value of 0.000). The total acetate uptake decreases linearly with the algal growth rate (Fig. 4d: the correlation coefficient R is −0.86 with a p-value of 0.003) because higher algal growth rates imply higher photosynthesis rates and a lower contribution of acetate towards the overall carbon requirements of the algal cells. All acetate-related correlations are also statistically significant and reactor independent. It is now possible to prepare a medium for batch H2 production by nutrient control for any photomixotrophic PBR under a wide variety of ambient conditions – all that is required is an initial measurement of the algal growth rate under those conditions. For example, if the growth rate is measured to be 0.1 h−1, the nutrient control medium needs to contain 29.5 mg/l of sulphate and 3060 mg/l of acetate."
14,Comparison of H2 production by different sulphur-deprivation techniques,"3.3 Comparison of H2 production by different sulphur-deprivation techniques 3.3.1 Dilution H2 production by S-deprivation experiments was carried out in the Imperial College flat-plate PBR at a light intensity of 12 W m−2. MIMS was used to measure H2 production rates and yields as described previously in Ref. [22]. S-deprivation was initiated by dilution, centrifugation and nutrient control methods. In the dilution method, a 10% v/v inoculum of growing algal cells was diluted in the sulphur-deplete TAP-S medium. In the first 25 h of the experiment, the algae grew aerobically to a maximum OD of 8.6 mg/l Chl (Fig. 5 a). At this point, the algae had already run out of the little sulphur that was present in the inoculum and the culture promptly became anaerobic 30 h into the experiment (Fig. 5b). H2 production commenced as soon as the anaerobic conditions were imposed and a maximum H2 production rate of 0.18 ml/l/h was reached at 96 h (66 h of anaerobic conditions). In addition to photolytic H2 production, some H2 was also produced by the catabolism of substrate, as evidenced by the decrease in OD from 8.6 mg/l Chl to 1.5 mg/l Chl over the course of the experiment. The H2 production duration was 182 h, resulting in a H2 yield of 23.6 ml/l. This yield is consistent with that measured in other dilution experiments in the literature [33,35]. The dilution method is clearly not optimised for H2 production in the flat-plate PBR at 12 W m−2 since the maximum OD of 8.6 mg/l Chl does not provide nearly enough PSII reaction centres for effective H2 production. 3.3.2 Centrifugation In the centrifugation method of S-deprivation, a fully-grown algal culture was pelleted out using a centrifuge and the algal cells were re-suspended in the sulphur-deplete TAP-S medium. The algal OD following centrifugation was 24.5 mg/l Chl, significantly higher than the maximum OD reached during the dilution method (Fig. 5c). A period of 24 h was required before the rate of photosynthesis became sufficiently downgraded by S-deprivation to induce anaerobic conditions (Fig. 5d). H2 production was initiated at this time and lasted for 147 h, reaching a maximum H2 production rate of 1.11 ml/l/h at 66 h (42 h of anaerobic conditions). The OD decreased over the course of the experiment, reaching a final value of 13.4 mg/l Chl, indicating that almost half of the available biomass was used for the production of H2 and other fermentative by-products such as organic acids and alcohols. The H2 yield was 102.7 ml/l, almost five times higher than the H2 yield from the dilution method, largely due to the greater number of PSII reaction centres (higher chlorophyll content) at the start of the H2 production stage. The H2 production rates and yields using the centrifugation technique are consistent with those measured in the literature for wild-type C. reinhardtii [8,25]. 3.3.3 Nutrient control The nutrient control method of sulphur-deprivation combines the high starting OD of the centrifugation method with the spontaneous H2 production of the dilution method. Since the TAP12 growth medium has been carefully optimised to provide just enough sulphate and acetate for C. reinhardtii growth, the algae attain a substantial maximum OD of 32.3 mg/l Chl (Fig. 6 a) 91 h from the start of the experiment. This OD is even higher than the starting OD of the centrifugation method because an excess of 20% of the algal cells are typically lost during the centrifugation and re-suspension procedure [13]. The entire sulphate concentration of 28.0 mg/l is consumed during the 90 h of algal growth at a specific uptake rate of 0.127 h−1 (Fig. 6b). The starting acetate concentration of 2550 mg/l is also used up during the algal growth stage at a specific uptake rate of 0.112 h−1 (Fig. 6c). The nutrient control experiment went through two anaerobic stages: a brief anaerobic stage between 15 and 69 h and a longer anaerobic stage from 90 h until the end of the experiment (Fig. 6d). The first anaerobic stage was likely caused by a large increase in the oxygen demand of the rapidly growing algal culture, which could not entirely be satisfied by photosynthesis. Since the flat-plate reactor was operated as a closed system, this resulted in anaerobic conditions during the mid-point of the algal growth stage. This phenomenon has already been observed at low photon flux densities, such as those associated with a light intensity of 12 W m−2 [39]. A peak H2 production rate of 0.25 ml/l/h was observed during the first anaerobic stage. The second anaerobic stage was the result of the regular S-deprivation procedure. It lasted for 210 h and reached a maximum H2 production rate of 1.30 ml/l/h at 130 h (40 h into the second anaerobic stage). The OD reduced to 21.3 mg/l Chl by the end of the experiment and the H2 yield was 112.7 ml/l. The H2 yield achieved by nutrient control was 9.7% higher than the H2 yield achieved by centrifugation. This is because the nutrient control method takes advantage of every grown algal cell, while the centrifugation procedure loses a proportion of available cells during the medium separation and exchange stages. The nutrient control method of S-deprivation results in a higher H2 production rate (Fig. 7 a) and a larger H2 yield (Fig. 7b) than either the centrifugation or dilution method. It does not require the energy intensive medium exchange procedure central to the centrifugation method. Unlike the dilution method, the initial concentrations of sulphate and acetate have been optimised to facilitate effective algal growth (and subsequent H2 production) for a specific set of ambient conditions in the flat-plate reactor. The H2 production by nutrient control does take a longer time to get started, but this time delay has been used effectively to grow algal biomass with optimum nutrient input. It is also the only method that can easily be scaled up for large continuous systems."
15,Conclusion,"C. reinhardtii growth kinetics have been successfully fitted by a logistic model, allowing the extraction of two important kinetic parameters, the specific growth rate and the maximum OD. The specific growth rate was found to increase with light intensity up to a saturation value of 0.154 h−1 (4.5 h doubling time), while no photoinhibition was observed in the 15–60 W m−2 light intensity range. Contrary to expectation, the maximum OD did not show a statistically significant increase with light intensity. A similar reverse logistic model has been used to fit sulphate and acetate uptake kinetics and to obtain the specific nutrient uptake rates and the total quantities of nutrient consumed. These two parameters are functions of the light intensity as well as of the specific algal growth rate. Higher light intensities (or higher specific growth rates) imply higher photosynthesis rates, increasing the turnover of the PSII repair mechanism and therefore increasing the demand for sulphur, both in terms of the specific sulphate uptake rate and of the total quantity of sulphur required. Similarly, higher light intensities (higher specific growth rates) lead to an increase in the specific acetate uptake rate. On the other hand, they also result in increased carbon dioxide fixation by the Calvin cycle and a corresponding decrease in the total quantity of acetate consumed. Evaluating the nutrient uptake rates and the total nutrient consumption as functions of the algal growth rate has revealed a set of statistically significant correlations, with a random distribution of data points indicating reactor independence. It is now possible to prepare a medium to facilitate batch or continuous H2 production by nutrient control in any photomixotrophic PBR geometry under ambient conditions as soon as the algal growth rate at those conditions has initially been measured. Three different methods of sulphur-deprivation were compared under similar conditions (same light intensity, wavelength, temperature and agitation) in the Imperial College flat-plate PBR. The dilution method of S-deprivation resulted in a maximum H2 production rate of 0.18 ml/l/h; the H2 production duration was 182 h, giving a H2 yield of 23.6 ml/l. The centrifugation method was more energy intensive overall, but the higher initial OD led to an improved H2 production rate of 1.11 ml/l/h. The H2 production lasted for a period of 147 h with a H2 yield of 102.7 ml/l. The nutrient control method of H2 production combined the high initial OD of the centrifugation method with the spontaneous H2 production of the dilution method. A starting sulphate concentration of 28.0 mg/l and a starting acetate concentration of 2550 mg/l were used to achieve algal growth up to an OD of 32.3 mg/l Chl (after 90 h) under nutrient-optimised conditions. The subsequent H2 production stage lasted for 210 h, with a maximum H2 production rate of 1.30 ml/l/h and a H2 yield of 112.7 ml/l. The nutrient control method of S-deprivation was easy to implement and it proved superior to its counterparts based on all the relevant H2 production criteria, indicating that it should be the method of choice for H2 production experiments as well as for scaled-up applications of biophotolytic H2 production."
