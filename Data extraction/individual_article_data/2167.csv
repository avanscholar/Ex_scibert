0,Introduction,"The olive oil industry has been playing an important role throughout the Mediterranean region, which accounts for approximately 95% of the worldwide olive oil production (Ergüder et al., 2000). The manufacturing process of olive oil usually produces an oily phase, a solid residue and a dark colored aqueous phase, the latter of which arises from the water content of the fruit (vegetable water). The so called olive mill wastewater (OMW) consist of a mixture of this vegetable water, some soft tissues from olive pulp in a relatively stable oil emulsion, and the process waters of the machinery cooling and fruit washings steps. In Mediterranean countries, annual OMW production is estimated to be over 30millionm3 (Sabbah et al., 2004), and around 1millionm3 of this quantity is produced in Turkey (Eroğlu et al., 2004). This dark colored wastewater has a high chemical oxygen demand (COD) and a high biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) values reaching up to 200g/L and 100g/L, respectively. OMW is generally composed of water (83–94%), organic matter (4–16%) and mineral salts (0.4–2.5%) (Ramos-Cormenzana et al., 1996; Paredes et al., 1999). The main organic constituents are oils (1–14%), polysaccharides (13–53%), proteins (8–16%), organic acids (3–10%), polyalcohols (3–10%) and polyphenols (2–15%) (Cabrera et al., 1996). As a consequence, the disposal of such a pollutant waste material is an important environmental problem that needs to be solved urgently. In general, most of the treatment processes used for high-strength industrial wastewaters have also been applied to olive mill wastewater. A number of OMW treatment methods have been employed in recent years and these can be divided into physico-chemical and biological ones (Pizzolato et al., 2002; Oukili et al., 2001). Dark color is one of the main indicators of water pollution, since it holds up the transmission of sunlight into a stream and reduces the photosynthetic activity of microorganisms (Kadirvelu et al., 2000). Color removal and the treatment of polluted water can be achieved with one or more of the following methods: adsorption, chemical degradation, photodegradation or biodegradation processes (Pizzolato et al., 2002; Oukili et al., 2001; Dias et al., 2004). Much of the research in color removal from wastewaters has been conducted by adsorption in low-cost materials such as silicates and zeolites (Yeh and Thomas, 1995; Mansi, 1996) and by advanced oxidation processes (H2O2/UV, UV/TiO2, O3/UV, Fe2+/H2O2) (Bellekhal et al., 2006; Liao et al., 1999). Although the photobiological H2 production capability of diluted OMW samples was found to give satisfactory results (highest H2 yield by 2% (v/v) OMW containing media was 14 L H 2 / L OMW ) , enhancement of the photobiological system is needed due to the dark color and bacteriostatic effects of OMW (Eroğlu et al., 2004). One of the powerful treatment processes for the inexpensive removal of color from water is adsorption. Adsorption techniques have proven successful in removing colored organics (Santi et al., 2008). Several adsorbents (such as activated carbon, natural clay, bentonite, silica, cement, charcoal, etc.) are eligible for such a purpose (Crini, 2006). Clay treatment is widely used in industry for separation, purification, and recovery processes. Adsorption with natural clays has great importance due to the ease of operation, comparable low-cost of application, and relatively high specific surface area. Oukili et al. (2001) proposed the use of the clay as adsorbent and hydrogen peroxide as oxidant for the physico-chemical treatment of OMW, in order to clarify water from the black-brownish color and to reduce the amounts of both polyphenols and the COD. Within this study, the bleaching led to 87% decrease of polyphenols and 66% decrease of COD, whereas the structure of clay had an effective catalytic and adsorbent effect on the removal of polyphenols. The color was observed to be changed from black-brown to translucent yellow. This remaining yellow-colored liquid can be retreated by other processes such as biological ones in order to remove the phenolic compounds that are responsible for the yellow color. After post-treatment using clay, Al-Malah et al. (2000) observed the decolorization of OMW with 81% removal efficiency of phenolic compounds and 71% of organic matter. In that study, a series of treatment steps composed of settling, centrifugation and filtration was consecutively used to condition OMW. Next, the filtrate was subjected to a post-treatment process with adsorption on clay molecules. The maximum adsorption capacity for the tested concentrations of clay was reached in less than 4h. It appears that the adsorption of phenols and organics was reversible and mainly caused by the hydrophobic interactions. The main objective of the current study is to develop a suitable two-stage process including clay pretreatment process followed by photofermentation; this will yield an efficient hydrogen production in addition to the significant remediation of OMW. Clay pretreatment technique was chosen due to its confirmed remediation potentials (Eroğlu et al., 2006). Photofermentation experiments were to be carried out in small-scale bioreactors (55mL) under indoor conditions, which gave the opportunity to investigate comparative experiments by operating several parallel runs. Attempts in this two-stage process also include extensive analyses to investigate the effect of pretreatment on photofermentation. Such a study is unique in this research area due to the simultaneous comparison of many parameters. These analyses are total phenol, total sugar, color, specific organic acids, phenols, amino acids, sugars, alcohols, gases evolved, cell concentration and pH. The precision of these results was also checked by applying mass balance equations on each stage of the process. The overall results obtained throughout this study may open a new opportunity for the olive oil industry and biohydrogen research as a result of the effective utilization of OMW at the end of these combined processes."
1,Methods,
2,Olive mill wastewater,2.1 Olive mill wastewater Olive mill wastewater samples were collected from a centrifugal olive oil mill in Izmir district (Western Anatolia).
3,Pretreatment with clay,"2.2 Pretreatment with clay Cloisite® Na+ was used as natural, white colored and fine-grained clay material. Characteristics of clay molecules were given by Eroğlu (2006). Clay pretreatment process was carried out by following the procedures given in Eroğlu et al. (2006)."
4,Photofermentative hydrogen production,"2.3 Photofermentative hydrogen production Effluent of clay pretreatment process was exposed to further manipulations such as dilution, pH change (6.8), and sterilization before being fed into photobioreactors for hydrogen production. The photofermentative hydrogen production experiments with Rhodobacter sphaeroides O.U.001 were performed in a 55ml glass vessel, under the illumination of a 150W tungsten lamp by following the procedures given in Eroğlu et al. (2006)."
5,Analysis,"2.4 Analysis Properties of OMW samples including COD, BOD, color, total phenols, and total solid (TS) content, elemental carbon/nitrogen/hydrogen, several metallic and non-metallic content were determined as given previously (Eroğlu et al., 2004). The Folin–Ciocalteu method was used to assay total phenolic content in this study (Slinkard and Singleton, 1977). Total sugar content of olive mill wastewater samples were analyzed by applying the Nelson–Somogyi method cited in Yıldız (2006). Liquid samples were initially filtered through a 5μm Nylon filters (R0-000381-55, Varian) for their organic acid, sugar, amino acid and alcohol analysis by HPLC system (Varian ProStar HPLC) in Middle East Technical University’s Central Laboratory. Twenty microliter of liquid samples were analyzed by a MetaCarb 87H (300×7.8mm, 5μm) HPLC column for their organic acid content. 0.008M H2SO4 was used as the mobile phase. The standard analysis of photobioreactor effluents was performed at 35°C with a mobile phase flow rate of 0.6mL/min. The flow rate and temperature were adjusted and maintained by an HPLC pump (ProStar 240 Quaternary Gradient Solvent Delivery Module). ProStar 330 PDA (210nm) was used to detect the column separation. Recording and integration of the chromatogram data was carried out through an electronic data acquisition unit. The relation between peak areas and component concentrations were determined by the construction of calibration curves for different concentrations of pure organic acid standards. All parameters of sugar and alcohol analysis are the same as those given for organic acids, except the detector type. ProStar 350 RI was used to detect the column separation. Amino acid content of the liquid samples (20μL) were analyzed by an Inertsil ODS-3 (250×4.6mm, 5μm) HPLC column. 0.1M NH4H2PO4 and 1M of MeCN was used as the mobile phase. The standard analysis of photobioreactor effluent was performed at 40°C with a mobile phase flow rate of 1mL/min. The flow rate and temperature were adjusted and maintained by an HPLC pump (ProStar 240 Quaternary Gradient Solvent Delivery Module). ProStar 330 PDA (254nm) was used to detect the column separation. Gas chromatographic analysis of phenolics was performed with a Varian CP-3800 GC, equipped with a flame ionization detector, split/splitless injector and a 30m×0.32mm×0.5μm cross-linked PEG capillary column (HP-INNOWax). Prior to injection, original solvent extraction technique using n-hexane was developed. The initial temperature of the column was 80°C for 1min followed with a ramp of 15°C/min and a final temperature of 230°C for 2min. The temperatures of the injector and detector were 240°C and 275°C, respectively. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 25ml/min. Column head pressure was kept constant for 13min at 12psi. An injection volume of 0.5μL was employed using the autosampler; with an initial split ratio of 50:1 followed by a 20:1 ratio after 30s."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Properties of olive mill wastewater,"3.1 Properties of olive mill wastewater The olive mill wastewater samples utilized throughout this study were obtained from a traditional olive oil mill in Izmir–Bornova (Western Anatolia). Since the physico-chemical properties of OMW depend on local and seasonal factors (i.e., type of processed olive fruit; oil extraction technique; harvesting time; cultivation area and etc.), a detailed analysis of each sample is extremely essential for such studies. The main characteristic properties of the OMW samples are given in Table 1 . As can be seen from Table 1, the OMW samples were slightly acidic with pH values around 4. It has a significant amount of COD (52.1g/L), BOD5 (23.8g/L), total solid matter (17.8g/L), total phenol (12.2g/L) and total sugar (15.1g/L) content. The dark color (61,500 PtCo APHA) corresponds with the high amount of solids and phenolics. Solid particles such as the olive fruit residues (i.e. olive pulp, husk, and some lignin derivatives) are known to consist of hardly biodegradable and light-absorbing aromatic compounds (Hamdi et al., 1991). On an elemental basis, this OMW sample contains relatively higher amounts of Fe (13.5g/L), K (2.68g/L), B (4.93g/L), Zn (2.01g/L), and Mo (1.78g/L). The presence of Mo and Fe are important on the aspects of H2 production since they are the inclusions of nitrogenase enzyme which is the stimulator of H2 production mechanism (Vignais and Billoud, 2007). According to the C/H/N elemental analysis on a dry basis, the molar C/N ratio was calculated as 73.8M/M. Evaluation of this parameter is essential for photosynthetic hydrogen production studies, since hydrogen production is favored under high C/N conditions (Erogˇlu et al., 1999). On the basis of organic acids, OMW samples contain relatively higher amount of acetic acid (9.71g/L), with aspartic (7.32g/L) and glutamic acid (7.65g/L) as the main amino acids. Additionally, ethanol (2.32g/L), normal-phenol (2.34g/L) and meta-cresol (2.56g/L) are present at higher levels with respect to the other alcohols and phenols, correspondingly."
8,Clay pretreatment process,"3.2 Clay pretreatment process According to the color, COD, and total phenol changes of OMW after clay pretreatment this technique was found to be a good alternative for a two stage hydrogen production process. High amounts of color (65%), COD (31%) and total phenol (81%) removal efficiencies were achieved after clay treatment process when 20g of clay added to 1L of raw OMW sample."
9,Comparison of photofermentation with or without clay pretreatment,"3.3 Comparison of photofermentation with or without clay pretreatment The aim of this part of the work is to gain further insight into photofermentation stage that was carried out with the effluent of clay treatment process. This two-stage process was compared with a single-stage process (photofermentation by using raw OMW without any pretreatment) as a control. The volumetric ratio of either the pretreatment effluent or raw OMW fed to the photobioreactor was kept constant at 4% (v/v). In addition to the analysis of hydrogen production and bacterial weight to determine the productivity and bacterial growth during the photofermentation process, time-course analysis were also obtained for the pH, total phenol, total sugar, color, specific organic acids, phenols, amino acids, sugars and alcohols. The average data are presented from two or three independent measurements; standard errors did not exceed 5% and are all shown as error bars in the subsequent figures. The total volume of hydrogen gas production, bacterial growth, pH and color changes of the effluent of clay treatment (4% (v/v)) and the raw OMW (4% (v/v)) media are given in the following figures (Figs. 1 and 2 , respectively). Correspondingly, total phenol and total sugar content over time for photofermentor liquids are shown in Fig. 3 . Changes in organic acids, sugars, phenolics, and amino acid content of photofermentor liquid are all given in the consecutive figures (Figs. 4–7 , respectively). As shown in Fig. 1, the clay pretreatment processes significantly enhance the hydrogen production. Compared to photofermentation with raw OMW (32mL), the amount of hydrogen production was improved by 100% as a result of clay pretreatment process (63mL). In spite of this, clay pretreatment effluent of OMW resulted in lower bacterial growth (Fig. 1) due to the removal of some biodegradable carbon sources such as biologically-digestible meta and ortho substitutions of phenolics (Fig. 6) and total sugars (Fig. 3). Another reason can be attributed to the enhancement of the nitrogenase enzyme which catalyzes hydrogen production during the limitations of nitrogen source (Vignais and Billoud, 2007; Koku et al., 2002). Excess amounts of nitrogen represses the synthesis of nitrogenase and decreases hydrogen production (Koku et al., 2002). As a result of the clay pretreatment process the amount of elemental nitrogen in the media was depleted, which leaded an enhancement on the nitrogenase enzyme and the hydrogen gas. No significant pH variation was observed during the photofermentation of clay effluents (Fig. 2). R. sphaeroides O.U.001 absorbs light energy at a wide range of light spectrum including the non-visible parts (i.e., 400–950nm), and contains the photosynthetic pigments of bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids of spheroidene series (Uyar et al., 2007). Nonetheless, most of the raw OMW samples absorb these wavelengths and have a shadowing effect on the photosynthetic bacteria. Consequently, color depletion (Fig. 2) enhances the photofermentative hydrogen production process. Phenol, m-cresol and o-cresol consumption rates (Fig. 6) were highest during the exponential phase of bacterial growth (around the first 25h). This finding correlates with the color depletion during the first 25h (Fig. 2). The results of the single-stage photofermentation experiment with the untreated-raw OMW sample showed that the hardly degradable para-cresols were not utilized during photofermentation process (Fig. 6a). After the exponential growth phase, the phenolics were significantly consumed and thus the photofermentor liquid becomes darker with higher light absorbance values due to the photosynthetic bacterial cell growth and accumulation of light-harvesting pigments such as carotenoids and bacteriochlorophyll. As a result of the clay treatment process, a high removal of total phenolic content (90%) was observed, in contrast to a moderate removal of total sugar (20%) and other organic content (i.e., organic acid, alcohol, and amino acids). Owing to the high depletion of its phenolic content (Fig. 6), the predominant organic constituent of the clay treatment effluent that remains is acetic acid. Aspartic acid, glutamic acid, ethanol, normal-phenol and meta-cresol are also present at higher concentrations. There is not a significant change on the organic acid consumption behaviors of the photofermentor liquid, either with raw OMW or with the effluent of clay treatment. The main difference is attributable to the prolonged consumption of acetic acid throughout the exponential hydrogen production for the experiments with clay effluents (Fig. 4b). This is due to the higher light penetration capability of the media at which acetate utilization through photosynthetic pathway was gained. For the effluent of clay treatment, the glucose consumption rate was significantly increased (Fig. 5b) after the stationary phase of bacterial growth and hydrogen production (around 100h) (Fig. 2). For each processes, the highest portion of the organic compounds was consumed during the exponential phase of bacterial growth (around the first 25h)."
10,Biological hydrogen productivities of photofermentative systems with or without clay pretreatment,"3.4 Biological hydrogen productivities of photofermentative systems with or without clay pretreatment The main reasons for the enhancement of photofermentative hydrogen production following clay treatment process are especially attributed to the efficiency of color removal (65%) and the decrease in compounds that are known to be toxic to bacterial cells. To be more precise, a detailed analysis of photofermentation stage with the effluent of clay treatment process is considerably required. The results of a single-stage and a two-stage process are compared on the context of hydrogen production and substrate consumption in Table 2 . In this table, the concentrations of organics at the inlet and at the outlet of photobioreactors (PBR) were given to illustrate the substrate consumption at the photofermentation step. According to these results the two-stage process appears to be a good alternative, in accordance with its significantly higher hydrogen production potential (32L/L), hydrogen production rates (0.016L/L/h or 0.084L/g/h), and light conversion efficiency (0.23%) results. One of the important aspects of the photobioreactor design is the light conversion efficiency (η), which depends on light intensity, irradiated area, duration time of H2 production and total amount of H2 production (Miyake and Kawamura, 1987). The Light conversion efficiency (η) is defined as the ratio of the total energy value of the obtained hydrogen (heat of combustion) to the total energy input of the photobioreactor by solar radiation and is calculated with the following formula (Miyake and Kawamura, 1987): (1) η ( % ) = 33.61 · ρ H 2 · V H 2 I · A · Δ t H 2 where V H 2 is the volume of H2 produced (L), ρ H 2 is the density of the hydrogen gas produced (g/L), I is the light intensity (W/m2), A is the irradiated area (m2) and Δ t H 2 is the duration of hydrogen production (h). Two expressions were used for the determination of gas production rate within the present study. The first is the average gas production rate per volume of culture (r g), which is calculated by dividing the total volume of gas produced by the volume of the culture and by the duration of gas production, with the unit of L/L/h. The second expression is the average gas production rate per bacterial dry weight ( r g 1 ) that is obtained by the time averaging of individual rates and has the unit of L/g/h. The individual rates for a certain period were calculated by dividing the volume increment of gas produced by the average cell concentration and by the duration of that period. Rate values of the current study are comparable with the rates mentioned in the literature. In the present study, r g and r g 1 results are within a range of 0.006–0.016L/L/h, and 0.021–0.084L/g/h, respectively. Sunita and Mitra (1993) found a rate of 0.002L/L/h from sewage wastewater by free cells and 0.003L/L/h by immobilized cells. Sasikala and Ramana (1991) observed a hydrogen production rate of 0.005L/L/h and 0.002L/g/h with 50% wastewater of lactic acid fermentation plant, using free R. sphaeroides O.U.001. Also, Zhu et al. (1999) calculated a relatively higher hydrogen production rate of 0.059L/L/h with tofu wastewater. The immobilization process and use of a different strain (i.e., R. sphaeroides RV) might account for their higher rates. Türkarslan et al. (1998) obtained 0.006L/g/h with the mixture of malate and diary plant wastewater. Koku et al. (2003) reported a maximum rate of 0.018L/g/h, in malic acid and sodium glutamate media. Eroğlu et al. (2004) observed the maximum rates (0.009L/L/h and 0.021L/g/h) for the case of 1% OMW containing media, using R. sphaeroides O.U.001in 400mL column photobioreactors. The hydrogen production potential (HPP), which is defined as total hydrogen gas produced per volume of OMW, has a value of 31.5L/L as a result of the clay pretreatment process, which is relatively higher than the literature. For example, Sasikala and Ramana (1991) reported a potential of 4.5L/L for 10% lactic acid fermentation plant wastewater. In another study of the same group (Sasikala et al., 1992), 1.0L/L was obtained for the case with free cells and 3.0L/L with immobilized cells in 10% distillery wastewater. Zhu et al. (1999) determined HPP as 1.9L/L for tofu wastewater, utilizing immobilized cells in agar gels. In our previous study with olive mill wastewater, we reported the highest potential as 14L/L in 400mL column photobioreactors (Eroğlu et al., 2004). Yetiş et al. (2000) observed 8.6L/L HPP values by the supplementation of malate into sugar refinery wastewater. As a consequence, hydrogen production from OMW appears to be a favorable process. Purple non-sulfur bacteria are known to be among the most metabolically diverse prokaryotes, with the capability of utilizing a wide variety of substrates as carbon and nitrogen sources (Koku et al., 2002). According to the previous experimental studies on photoheterotrophic growth, R. sphaeroides is known to utilize several carbon sources, such as lactate, butyrate, pyruvate, acetate, citrate, fumarate, malate, succinate, glucose, fructose and glycerol (Koku et al., 2002). In the present study, significant utilization of acetic, butyric, lactic and propionic acids as well as glutamic acid, aspartic acids, glucose, mannitol, n-phenol and m-cresol constituents were observed (Table 2). For a two-stage process, much higher amounts of organic acids were consumed in parallel to enhanced hydrogen production. Although n-phenol and m-cresol removal percentages (85%) were obtained to be higher for the clay effluent case, the total amount of their consumption is much higher during the experiments with raw OMW sample, which is initially rich in phenolic content. With regard to the clay treatment process, phenolic compounds in the photofermentor inlet were highly depleted. As a matter of fact, bacteria can easily utilize these biologically-degradable phenolic compounds present at lower concentrations. It appears that this is the first report in the literature for the consumption of phenol, m-cresol, o-cresol, arabinose and mannitol by photosynthetic bacteria."
11,Process evaluation,"3.5 Process evaluation The experimental and theoretical yields of hydrogen that could be produced from the consumption of organic substrates present in OMW are compared in Table 3 . Theoretical amounts were obtained by considering that all of the substrate was used for hydrogen and carbon dioxide production according to the following reaction (Sasikala et al., 1993): (2) C x H y O z + ( 2 x - z ) H 2 O → ( y / 2 + 2 x - z ) H 2 + x CO 2 According to Table 3, hydrogen yields on the basis of the net amount of OMW (4% v/v of the photobioreactor fluid) was obtained as 2.40 and 2.83g/LOMW for the single-stage and two-stage processes, respectively. Both of these values are relatively higher than the experimental results (1.50mg/LOMW for one-stage and 2.72g/LOMW for two-stage). In relation to the elemental analysis single-stage and two-stage processes were obtained to have 2.57molC/LOMW (30.8g/L) and 1.34molC/LOMW (16.1g/L), respectively. According to the inlet compositions of the PBR, the analyzed carbon content was 25.4g/L for single-stage processes and 12.3g/L for two-stage processes which are close to the total amounts calculated by the elemental analysis results. However, it should not be overlooked that the additional amounts, resulting from the undetected organic substrates (such as short chain fatty acids, citric acids, complex sugars, etc) would increase theoretical values. These calculations showed that the amount of experimental hydrogen gas production is in the range of the theoretical yield. In particular, the main organic compounds for hydrogen production are acetic, lactic, propionic, glutamic and butyric acids as well as phenol and meta-cresol. By applying the clay pretreatment technique, it was observed that a higher amount of substrate was converted into hydrogen. Lower substrate conversion was observed for the one-stage process due to the probable shift of the metabolism for bacterial growth and PHB synthesis instead of hydrogen evolution."
12,Conclusions,"Compared to the photofermentation with raw OMW ( 16 L H 2 / L OMW ) , the amount of hydrogen production was improved by 100% during photofermentation with the effluent of clay pretreatment process ( 31.5 L H 2 / L OMW ) . The main reasons for the improvement of hydrogen production by clay treatment can be attributed to the high removal of the hardly biodegradable compounds such as phenols (∼80%); minor removal of organic acids, sugars and amino acids (∼20%) that are known to enhance photofermentative hydrogen production; and the color depletion (∼65%) of raw OMW which might cause a shadowing effect on the photosynthetic bacteria. Another reason can be attributed to the enhancement of the nitrogenase enzyme which catalyzes hydrogen production during the limitations of nitrogen source (Vignais and Billoud, 2007; Koku et al., 2002). As a result of the clay pretreatment process, the amount of elemental nitrogen in the media was depleted that leaded an enhancement on the nitrogenase enzyme and the hydrogen gas. Main organic compounds resulting higher hydrogen production rates were found to be acetic, lactic, propionic, and butyric acids. It also appears that this is the first report in the literature for the consumption of phenol, m-cresol, o-cresol, arabinose and mannitol by photosynthetic bacteria. Based on these hydrogen production results with the effluent of clay pretreatment process (HPPmax is around 30L hydrogen per 1LOMW), the biological hydrogen production potential of olive mill wastewater for the Mediterranean countries (generating more than 30millionm3 of OMW per year) would be circa 109 m3 H2 per year, which would result in approximately 3000GWh/y electricity through an appropriate fuel cell application having around 70% conversion efficiency."
