0,Introduction,"With the rapid development of economy and continuous improvement of people's living standards, the demand for energy has continued to rise. At present, fossil energies such as coal, oil, and natural gas are still the world's main energy sources, but they are limited and non-renewable. At the same time, the large consumption of fossil energy can not only produce a large amount of toxic and harmful gases such as nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides, but also cause a greenhouse effect, which will further affect the living environment of human beings. To cope with the energy crisis and environmental pollution problems, the development of non-polluting, renewable, high–energy density clean energy is of great practical significance for safeguarding people's living standards and the global ecological environment. Among many new energy sources, hydrogen has the high energy density, and its combustion product is water without carbon emission and environment pollution; therefore, hydrogen is regarded as one of the most ideal energy sources [1,2]. Therefore, the development of hydrogen energy is crucial to solve the current energy and environment problems. Among many hydrogen production methods, electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production have received extensive attention. Electrocatalytic water splitting by utilizing the renewable nature energy (such as wind and water energy) is one of the most effective hydrogen production technologies that can be developed on a large scale because of the non-pollution nature [3–6]. Photocatalytic water splitting is a promising hydrogen production technology, which can continuously utilize the inexhaustible sunlight to excite semiconductor photocatalysts to realize hydrogen production without any pollution [7–9]. Therefore, it is very important and necessary to develop these two clean hydrogen production technologies: electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting. Electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting are all the non-spontaneous energy-consuming reactions under standard temperature and pressure conditions. Thermodynamically, the energy required for 1 mol of water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen is 237.2 kJ; because of the influence of water splitting kinetics, it always needs more energy consumption [10]. In electrocatalytic water splitting, the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involve multi-electron transfer process, which produces the overpotential and causes the energy loss [11,12]. In photocatalytic water splitting, until now the light absorption ability, photogenerated carrier separation efficiency, and the number of reactive sites still limit the activity of photocatalytic hydrogen production, leading to a low solar energy conversion efficiency [13]. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop effective strategies to reduce the overpotential of electrocatalytic water splitting and improve the hydrogen production efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting to realize the efficient energy conversion. As we all know, almost all of the catalytic reactions are carried out at the surface or the interface of the catalyst. Therefore, the surface states of the catalyst (size, component, structure, morphology, defects, number of reaction reactive sites, etc.) strongly affect the catalytic activity [14,15]. When the designed catalyst contains multiple phase components, the interfaces are formed between the different components. The interfacial structures and properties can influence the transfer efficiency of charge carrier, charge distribution, the number of active sites, and so on, which strongly affect the catalyst's performance [15,16]. Therefore, the surface and interfacial regulation of electrocatalysts and photocatalysts can play an important role to improve the hydrogen production efficiency from water splitting. Although some excellent reviews have summarized the methods for the improvement of electrocatalytic or photocatalytic water splitting performances, there is almost no review about the general method for the improvement of both electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting performances, and the relationship between electrocatalysts and photocatalysts in water splitting is needed to be revealed. Therefore, it is of significance and necessary to summary the general method, surface and interfacial regulation, for the improvement of both electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting performances, and reveal the relationship between electrocatalysts and photocatalysts in water splitting. In this review, the basic principles and performance evaluation parameters of electrocatalytic and photocatalytic hydrogen production are first introduced, followed by a comprehensive summary of the research progress in electrocatalysts and photocatalysts for hydrogen production from water splitting. Subsequently, special focus is put on the surface and interfacial regulation strategies of electrocatalysts and photocatalysts for improving their H2 production performances from water splitting. The main methods contain morphology regulation, doping and surface defect engineering, heterojunction construction, and cocatalyst modification. These strategies can regulate and optimize the electronic structure, exposed crystal plane, charge transfer, conductivity, surface and interfacial properties, and provide more active sites for electrocatalysts. Meanwhile, they can adjust the band structure, exposed crystal plane, and charge transfer path; optimize the light absorption; provide more active sites; and promote the effective separation of photogenerated carriers for photocatalysts. Finally, we also highlight the development of HER and OER electrocatalysts have the important positive effect on promoting the solar-to-hydrogen conversion in photocatalytic water splitting systems because they can be used as cocatalysts in photocatalytic water splitting because of their similar properties. We hope this review can inspire and expand the applications of surface and interfacial regulation strategies in future study of advanced electrocatalysts and photocatalysts to realize the efficient hydrogen production."
1,Basic principles and performance evaluation parameters of electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting,
2,Basic principles of electrocatalytic water splitting,"2.1 Basic principles of electrocatalytic water splitting Theoretically, the minimum voltage required for electrocatalytic water splitting is 1.23 V (relative to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) potential) [17]. However, because of the need to overcome the activation barrier inside the electrode, the solution resistance, and contact resistance, it is usually necessary to apply a voltage greater than 1.23 V to achieve pure water electrolysis. The mechanism of electrocatalytic water splitting is shown in Fig. 1. The water electrolysis cell contains a cathode, an anode, and an electrolyte; the corresponding hydrogen and oxygen evolution catalysts are placed on the cathode and anode. When the voltage applied between the anode and cathode meets the requirement of water splitting, the water can be split into hydrogen and oxygen; this process involves cathodic HER and anodic OER. In different electrolytes, the process of the two half reactions of electrocatalytic water splitting is different. In acidic media: Cathode (HER) 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2 Anode (OER) 2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e− In neutral or alkaline media: Cathode (HER) 4H2O + 4e− → 4OH− + 2H2 Anode (OER) 4OH− → 2H2O + O2 + 4e− Total reaction: 2H2O (l) → O2 (g) + 2H2 (g) HER is a multistep process that occurs on the surface of the cathode electrode. In acidic media, HER has two possible reaction mechanisms: Volmer–Heyrovsky or Volmer–Tafel [3,18]. As shown in Fig. 2 , the first step of the acidic HER is the Volmer reaction (discharge reaction, H+ + e− → Hads), electron transfers to the catalyst surface can react with the H+ in the solution at the active site to form the adsorbed hydrogen atoms (Hads). Subsequently, the second step is desorption and aggregation of the adsorbed hydrogen atoms (Hads) for H2 production; this process may be carried out through different reaction paths. When the adsorbed hydrogen atoms (Hads) have a low occupancy on the catalyst surface, an electron transfers to Hads and combines with another H+ in the solution to form H2; this process is a Heyrovsky reaction (electrochemical desorption process, Hads + H+ + e− → H2). When the adsorbed hydrogen atoms have a high occupancy on the catalyst surface, two adjacent Hads can combine together to form H2; this process is called Tafel reaction (chemical desorption process, Hads + Hads → H2). The difference between the HER reaction in an alkaline medium and an acidic medium lies in the first step (Volmer reaction), hydrogen protons (H+) in acidic media are derived from hydronium ions (H3O+), whereas hydrogen protons (H+) in alkaline media are derived from water molecules (discharge reaction, H2O + e− → OH− + Hads); the subsequent desorption and aggregation of the adsorbed hydrogen atoms (Hads) for H2 production have the similar procedure with that in an acidic medium. OER, as another half reaction of electrocatalytic water splitting, involves a four-electron transfer process with the sluggish kinetics, which can strongly influence the electrocatalytic water splitting performance. The reaction processes of OER in acidic and alkaline media are also different. As shown in Fig. 3 , Suen et al. [19] detailed the possible reaction pathways of OER in acidic and alkaline media. OER reaction process in acidic media (M represents the active site on the catalyst surface): Step 1: M + H2O → M-OH + H+ + e− Step 2: M-OH → M-O + H+ + e− Step 3: 2M-O → 2M + O2 or M-O + H2O → M-OOH + H+ + e− Step 4: M-OOH → M + O2 + H+ + e− Total reaction: 2H2O (l) → O2 (g) + 4H+ (aq) + 4e−; OER reaction process in alkaline or neutral media: Step 1: M + OH− → M-OH + e− Step 2: M − OH + OH− → M-O + H2O + e− Step 3: 2M-O → 2M + O2 or M-O + OH− → M-OOH + e− Step 4: M-OOH + OH− → M + H2O + O2 + e− Total reaction: 4OH− (aq) → 2H2O (l) + O2 (g) + 4e− [19]. In the aforementioned steps, there are two possible reaction paths in step 3. One is to generate oxygen by direct bonding of two adjacent adsorbed oxygen atom intermediates (M-O); the other is to further produce peroxide intermediate (M-OOH) and generate oxygen through subsequent reaction."
3,Basic principle of photocatalytic water splitting,"2.2 Basic principle of photocatalytic water splitting Since 1972, Fujishima and Honda [8]firstly discovered that the TiO2 photoelectrode can split water into hydrogen and oxygen under ultraviolet light; the use of semiconductors as photocatalysts for water splitting has received extensive attention. The mechanism of photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production is shown in Fig. 4; when the light with sufficient energy irradiates on the semiconductor photocatalyst, the electrons in the valence band are excited and transfer to the conduction band, and the corresponding holes are generated on the valence band. The positions of the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of the photocatalyst are very important for realizing the pure water splitting because they represent the redox capability of photogenerated electrons and holes. It is required that the position of the CB bottom of the semiconductor is more negative than the reduction potential of H+/H2 (0 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode [NHE] at pH = 0), and the position of the VB top is more positive than the oxidation potential of O2/H2O (1.23 V vs. NHE at pH = 0), so that the photogenerated electrons and holes can meet the basic thermodynamic conditions for pure water splitting. Most of the photogenerated electrons and holes recombine in the photocatalyst interior, and only a small part of the photogenerated electrons and holes can successfully migrate to the photocatalyst surface. The photogenerated electrons and holes that migrate to the photocatalyst surface can be used to reduce H+ to H2 and oxidize H2O to O2, respectively. Generally, the process of photocatalytic pure water splitting for hydrogen production is very difficult to achieve. Therefore, it is usually necessary to add a sacrificial agent to the reaction system to realize the half reaction of photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production. The photogenerated electrons are used to reduce H+ to H2, and the corresponding photogenerated holes are used to oxidize the sacrificial agent. Generally, the alcohol, sulfide, organic acid, and so on can be used as the sacrificial agents [20–22]. Photogenerated holes are easily captured and consumed by the sacrificial agent with high reducibility; therefore, this process is easier to proceed than direct oxidation of water to produce O2 in photocatalytic pure water splitting. In this way, the recombination of photogenerated carriers can be effectively suppressed, and the performance of photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production can be further improved. From the mechanism of photocatalytic water splitting, we can obtain the influence factors for photocatalytic hydrogen production: light absorption ability, energy band positions, separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, and the number of surface active sites. To achieve the efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production performance, the following conditions must be met. First, the energy band positions of the photocatalyst must meet the requirement of photocatalytic water splitting, so that the photogenerated carrier can have the sufficient redox capacity to take part in the water splitting reaction. Second, the photocatalyst should have the good light absorption capacity, so that more photogenerated electrons and holes can be generated. Third, the photogenerated electron–holes need to be effectively separated and transfer to the surface to participate in the photocatalytic reaction. Fourth, the surface of the semiconductor photocatalyst needs the suitable cocatalyst, which can effectively reduce the reaction barrier and provide the active sites for water splitting to efficiently avoid the recombination of photogenerated carriers. Only if these conditions are fulfilled, the efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting can be realized."
4,Performance evaluation parameters of electrocatalytic water splitting,"2.3 Performance evaluation parameters of electrocatalytic water splitting The performance evaluation parameters of electrocatalytic water splitting mainly include overpotential, Tafel slope, exchange current density ( j 0 ), stability, Faraday efficiency, and adsorption strength of the intermediate on the catalyst surface. 2.3.1 Overpotential (η) In the electrocatalytic water splitting system, because of the existence of kinetic energy barrier, it is usually necessary to apply an additional driving force, that is, an additional potential to drive the electrochemical reaction, this additional potential is the overpotential (η). Both HER and OER require the overpotentials; as shown in Fig. 5 , the actual voltage required to split water (Eapp) is greater than the thermodynamic equilibrium voltage (E0 = 1.23 V) [23,24]. There are three types of overpotentials: activation overpotential, concentration overpotential, and resistance overpotential. The activation overpotential is an inherent property of the electrode material; different materials have different activation overpotentials. Therefore, only selection of a suitable electrocatalytic material can reduce the activation overpotential. The concentration overpotential is caused by the ion concentration difference between the electrolyte and electrode surface due to the slow diffusion rate of ions at the beginning of electrode reaction, and the concentration overpotential can be reduced by improve the material transport to the electrode, e.g. by stirring. The most important resistance overpotential is generated at the surface and interface of the test system, which causes the measured overpotential of the electrode larger than the true value. The resistance overpotential is generally eliminated by the ohmic drop compensation (IR compensation), which can obtain the accurate overpotential during the electrocatalytic water splitting. In the three-electrode system, the resistance overpotential is mainly derived from the resistance between the Luggin capillary tip and the working electrode surface. This resistance is the R in the IR compensation, the IR compensation can be expressed as the following formula [25]. E correction = I × R E corrected = E uncorrected - E correction = E uncorrected - I × R E is the potential and I is the current through the entire system. For HER, η HER = E HER – 0 V; for OER, η OER = E OER – 1.23 V. The excellent electrocatalyst for water splitting should have a small overpotential and reduce the energy consumption; therefore, the overpotential is an important parameter for evaluating the performance of electrocatalytic water splitting. At present, a method for evaluating the performance of a catalyst by comparing the required overpotential at the same current density has been widely recognized, such as 10 mA/cm2 (η 10) [26,27]. For an electrocatalyst with a strong redox peak during the HER or OER (current density greater than 10 mA/cm2), overpotentials at 50 and 100 mA/cm2 can also be used as the evaluation parameters for eletrocatalytic water splitting. 2.3.2 Tafel slope Tafel slope is a very important evaluation parameter for the electrocatalytic water splitting kinetics; The Tafel plot can be converted to a plot of log|j| versus η by the polarization curve obtained from a linear sweep voltammogram. The linear part of the Tafel plot can be represented by the Tafel equation: η = a + b × log|j|, where η is the overpotential, a stands for the Tafel constant, b is the Tafel slope, and j is the current density. The smaller the value of the Tafel slope indicates the smaller the overpotential required at the same current density and the better the electrochemical performance of an electrocatalyst. The mechanisms and rate-determining steps of electrocatalytic HER and OER can be obtained based on the value of Tafel slope [17,28]. For HER, the Tafel slope values for three extreme conditions can be obtained by the Butler–Volmer equation [29]: (1) When the Tafel slope is 120 mV/dec, the Volmer reaction of the first step in HER (discharge reaction, acidic media: H+ + e− → Hads or alkaline media: H2O + e− → OH− + Hads) is slow, the Volmer reaction is the rate-determining step. (2) When the Tafel slope is 40 mV/dec, the first Volmer reaction in HER is faster, and the subsequent adsorbed hydrogen atoms are combined to produce H2 by electrochemical desorption (Heyrovsky reaction, acidic media: Hads + H+ + e− → H2 or alkaline media: Hads + H2O + e− → H2 + OH−), the Heyrovsky reaction is the rate-determining step in HER. (3) When the Tafel slope is 30 mV/dec, the first Volmer reaction in HER is faster, and the subsequent adsorbed hydrogen atoms are combined to produce H2 by chemical desorption (Tafel reaction, acidic or alkaline media: Hads + Hads → H2). From the Tafel slope, we can recognize the reaction mechanism of HER and corresponding rate-determining step, and further improvement methods can be proposed in accordance with the reaction mechanism and the corresponding rate-determining step. For OER, the reaction is a four-electron transfer process and involves the production of three intermediates (OH∗, O∗ and OOH∗) on the catalyst surface. Tafel slope reflects the intrinsic activity of the catalyst and can determine the rate-limiting step in OER. When the Tafel slope is 120 mV/dec, the single electron transfer step is the rate-determining step, which is the first reaction step in the OER (electrochemical adsorption of OH− and formation of OH∗); When the Tafel slope is 90 mV/dec, the second electron transfer step is the rate-determining step, which is the process of generating the O∗ intermediate in the OER reaction; When the Tafel slope is 60 mV/dec, the third electron transfer step is the rate-determining step, which is the process of generating OOH∗ intermediates in the OER; When the Tafel slope is 30 mV/dec, the forth electron transfer step is the rate-determining step, which is the dehydrogenation process of OOH∗ intermediates to produce O2 [19,30–32]. The smaller the value of Tafel slope, exhibiting the rate-determining step is at the ending part of the multi-electron transfer process, the better the OER performance of an electrocatalyst. From the Tafel slope, we can recognize the OER mechanism and the corresponding rate-determining step, which are beneficial to the design of further modification method. 2.3.3 Exchange current density (j 0) The exchange current density is the intrinsic property of the electrocatalyst. It depends only on the catalyst itself under specific temperature and electrolyte, which reflects the electron transfer ability and the difficulty of electrode reaction [33]. The intrinsic reason of overpotential is the exchange current density, and electrode reaction with larger exchange current density needs smaller overpotential. As per Tafel equation (η = a + b × log|j|), the value of exchange current density (j 0) at an overpotential of zero can be obtained by extrapolating the linear portion of Tafel plot to the intersection with the X-axis. The electrocatalyst with a good catalytic property should have a large exchange current density (j 0). 2.3.4 Stability Stability is another important parameter for evaluating the performance of the HER and OER electrocatalyst, and it is important for the practical application. The stability test involves three different techniques: cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry, and chronopotentiometry. After a number of CV cycle tests, the smaller the change in polarization curve compared with the initial polarization curve, the better the stability of the electrode. When the stability test is performed by the chronoamperometry, small potential fluctuation (during a long-term constant current test) means the good stability of the electrode. Similarly, when the stability test is performed by the chronopotentiometry, small current fluctuation (during a long-term constant voltage test) means the good stability of the electrode. 2.3.5 Faradic efficiency In the process of electrochemical reaction, the electrons supplied from the external circuit take part in the electrode reaction to obtain the target product, and the conversion ratio is called Faradic efficiency. In general, the loss of Faradic efficiency lies in the generation of heat and other side reactions (production of non-target products). For HER and OER, the corresponding Faradic efficiency can be obtained by comparing the amount of H2 and O2 measured in the electrochemical experiment with the theoretical amount of H2 and O2, respectively. 2.3.6 Adsorption strength of the intermediate on the catalyst surface The HER and OER activities depend largely on the bonding strength of the intermediates (H∗, OH∗, O∗ and OOH∗) on the catalyst surface during water splitting. The density functional theory (DFT) can be applied in the process of HER and OER; the change of Gibbs free energy (ΔG) during the reaction can directly describe the bonding strength of the intermediate product on the catalyst surface. By comparing ΔG, we can initially evaluate the performance of the catalyst. In HER, the adsorption free energy of H∗ is a very important parameter. Generally speaking, a good HER catalyst should have an optimal hydrogen adsorption–free energy, which represents the binding strength of catalyst to H∗ [34]. The weak adsorption causes difficulty in the combination between the produced H∗ and catalyst; the strong adsorption causes difficulty in desorption of H∗ from the catalyst surface, which are all detrimental to HER. The standard hydrogen electrode potential is defined as zero; therefore, the hydrogen adsorption free energy of a good HER catalyst should be negative but close to zero. As shown in Fig. 6 , Ni-doped CoP showed the optimal hydrogen adsorption energy (−0.03 eV) and the best HER activity with the smallest overpotential of 144 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and Tafel slope of 52 mV/dec in 0.5 M H2SO4 [35]. The OER involves a four-electron transfer process and the formation of multiple intermediates (OH∗, O∗, and OOH∗); the DFT calculation is used to describe the four reaction steps involved in the OER process, in which the changes in Gibbs free energy are named ΔGI, ΔGII, ΔGIII, and ΔGIV. The overpotential is defined as follows: η = max (ΔGI, ΔGII, ΔGIII, ΔGIV) – 1.23 eV. Among the ΔGI, ΔGII, ΔGIII, and ΔGIV, the reaction step with the maximum ΔG represents the rate-determining step of OER. As shown in Fig. 7 , both NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and NiFeV LDHs have the maximum ΔG in the second reaction step; therefore, the second reaction step is the rate-determining step during OER. Under the same rate-determining step, the smaller the value of ΔG, the smaller the overpotential required of OER and the better the OER activity. The ΔGII of NiFeV LDHs is 1.64 eV, which is smaller than that of the NiFe LDHs (1.89 eV). Therefore, NiFeV LDHs has better OER activity than NiFe LDHs [36]."
5,Performance evaluation parameters of photocatalytic water splitting,"2.4 Performance evaluation parameters of photocatalytic water splitting There are three important parameters in photocatalytic water splitting need to be noted, containing the photocatalytic H2 and O2 production rate, quantum efficiency, and stability. 2.4.1 Photocatalytic H2 and O2 production rate The performance of photocatalytic water splitting can be obtained by directly measuring the amount of H2 or O2 produced in a certain period under light irradiation, which is the most intuitive parameter for evaluating the photocatalytic performance. The unit of H2 and O2 production rate is μmol/h or μmol/h/g; when H2 and O2 are produced in a large amount, mmol/h or mmol/h/g can be used as the unit. The normalized unit facilitates the performance comparison between different photocatalysts under the similar experimental condition. 2.4.2 Quantum efficiency The different test conditions of photocatalytic water splitting in different research groups, such as the top irradiation type, the area of light irradiation, the intensity of light, the choice of light source (Xe lamp or Hg lamp), etc., affect the activity of photocatalytic water splitting, which makes it difficult to directly compare the activity of photocatalytic water splitting in different research groups and even the same photocatalyst. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) can reflect the efficiency of light conversion into chemical energy, which cannot be affected by the factors such as light source, light intensity, and light area and can reflect the inherent activity of the photocatalyst. Therefore, it is the best and effective indicator for evaluating the performance of photocatalytic water splitting in different conditions and research groups; the calculation formulas of the overall quantum efficiency and apparent quantum efficiency are formula (1) and formula (2,3), respectively [37]. (1) Overall quantum efficiency = the number of reacted electrons the number of absorbed photons × 100 % (2) Apparent quantum efficiency = 2 × the number of produced hydrogen molecules the number of incident photons × 100 % ( H 2 production ) (3) Apparent quantum efficiency = 4 × the number of produced oxygen molecules the number of incident photons × 100 % ( O 2 production ) 2.4.3 Stability As an excellent photocatalyst, it not only needs the good photocatalytic water splitting performance, but also needs the good stability. Stability is an important parameter for evaluating the practical application of photocatalyst. To test the stability of the photocatalyst, a long-term circulation experiment is needed. The smaller the performance fluctuation during the circulation experiment, the better the stability of the photocatalyst."
6,Research progress in electrocatalysts and photocatalysts for hydrogen production from water splitting,
7,Research progress in electrocatalysts for hydrogen production from water splitting,"3.1 Research progress in electrocatalysts for hydrogen production from water splitting Electrocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production involves HER and OER; therefore, both the choices of cathode and anode materials are important for the electrocatalytic water splitting. To date, precious metal Pt-based materials are currently the most outstanding HER electrocatalysts, and precious metal–based RuO2 and IrO2 are currently the most outstanding OER electrocatalysts [38,39]. However, these precious metal-based materials are not abundant in the earth, which limits their large-scale practical applications and increases the cost of hydrogen production from water splitting. Therefore, the current research on the electrocatalyst for water splitting is mainly concentrated on the abundant and low-cost materials on the earth. 3.1.1 Research progress in HER electrocatalysts After years of research, many non-noble metal–based HER electrocatalysts have been developed; among them, the transition metal sulfides, nitrides, phosphides, carbides, and borides have received extensive research and attention. 3.1.1.1 Transition metal sulfides Transition metal sulfides have attracted much attention because of their abundant reserves, good electrical conductivity, and metal-like properties. In recent years, the application of transition metal sulfides in electrocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production has also been gradually discovered, such as MoS2 and WS2 with a typical two-dimensional layer structure and pyrite structure of NiS2, CoS2 and FeS2. In 2005, Hinnemann et al. [40]first discovered that the Mo edge structure in (1010) crystal plane of MoS2 was very similar to the active site of nitrogenase, and the calculated free energy of atomic hydrogen bonding at the edge of MoS2 was very similar to the free energy of the atomic hydrogen bonding with noble metal Pt (Fig. 8 ); it is theoretically proved that MoS2 might be a very promising HER electrocatalyst [40]. Subsequent experimental results further confirmed that the MoS2 edge site was indeed a very favorable HER active site. For example, Chung et al. [41] used sodium molybdate as a molybdenum source and L-cysteine as a sulfur source to synthesize an edge-exposed MoS2 structure by hydrothermal reaction; they revealed a linear relationship between the exchange current density and the number of edge sites of sulfur in MoS2, demonstrating that the HER active sites was at the edge of sulfur in MoS2 nanosheets [41]. Yan et al. [42]synthesized the MoS2 nanosheets with a thickness of 4–6 nm by a solvothermal method using (NH4)2MoS4 as a precursor and mixed N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and water solution as a solvent; they verified the existence of the bridged S2 2− or apical S2− in MoS2 nanosheets by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis and these unsaturated sulfur sites played a positive effect on the HER performance of MoS2 (with a low onset potential of −90 mV and a small Tafel slope of 53 mV/dec in 0.5 M H2SO4) [42]. MoS2 can present two typical phase structures (2H and 1T), depending on the Mo coordination by the six S atoms [43]. Among them, metallic 1T-MoS2 has better electrical conductivity and more catalytic active sites for HER than that of the semiconducting 2H-MoS2 because of its distorted octahedral coordination structure [43,44]. Li et al. [45]synthesized the cracked monolayer 1T MoS2 with a porous structure through the sonication-assisted lithium intercalation of the initial 2H MoS2; the cracked monolayer 1T MoS2 exhibited a significantly improved HER activity with a lower overpotential of 156 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a smaller Tafel slope of 42.7 mV/dec than that of 2H MoS2 (274 mV and 75.3 mV/dec, respectively) in 0.5 M H2SO4 because of the increased electrical conductivity and catalytic active sites [45]. WS2 and MoS2 have many similarities in structure and physicochemical property; therefore, it also receives extensive attention in HER. For example, Cheng et al. [46] selected WCl6 and S as precursors to synthesize the single-layer 2H-WS2 nanosheets by the high-temperature solution-phase method, and it exhibited efficient and durable HER activity with a small overpotential of 100 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope of 48 mV/dec in 0.5 M H2SO4, which can match to the extensively studied MoS2 [46]. Voiry et al. [47] reported the synthesis of monolayer WS2 nanosheets containing a high concentration of 1T phase WS2 by chemical stripping using the lithium-ion intercalation method; it showed better HER activity than the as-exfoliated 2H phase MoS2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 because of the increased number and catalytic activity of active sites [47]. Hydrogenases can promote the combination of protons and electrons to produce hydrogen at a low potential, and their HER activities are even better than those of Pt [48,49]. Most of the hydrogenases contain Ni and Fe metal ions, and their active sites of HER are the metal sulfide clusters contained in the protein. Inspired by the structure of hydrogenases, Ni- and Fe-based sulfides have also been widely studied as electrocatalysts for HER. For example, Kong et al. [50] firstly found that both FeS2 and NiS2 can be used as active non-precious metal HER catalysts in an acidic electrolyte, and FeS2 had a better HER stability than NiS2 under acidic conditions. Feng et al. [51] reported that Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays in situ grown on nickel foams can be used as a HER catalyst, and it was found that Ni3S2 with high-index crystal face exposure exhibited the ultrastable and excellent HER activity with an overpotential of 170 mV at 10 mA/cm2 under neutral media (pH 7). Tang et al. [52]synthesized the NiS2 nanosheets array on carbon cloth (CC) by a direct sulfurizing treatment of Ni(OH)2/CC using the S powder at 500 °C for 60 min in the Ar atmosphere, which showed the HER performance with an overpotential of 149 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 104 mV/dec in 1.0 M KOH. Cobalt sulfide is also used in HER, and recent studies have shown that CoS2 even has better HER activity than FeS2 and NiS2 in acid solution [50,53]. Zhang et al. [54]synthesized the CoS2 nanopyramid array on 3D carbon fiber paper through the one-step solvothermal method using CoCl2 and thiourea as a precursor, which exhibited an ultrahigh HER activity with a small overpotential of 70 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope of 70.1 mV/dec in 0.5 M H2SO4. Ma et al. [55]synthesized the ultrathin NiCo2S4 nanoflakes on Ni foam by the hydrothermal sulfurizing treatment of NiCo-LDH precursor in thioacetamide solution, and it can be used in HER in 1.0 M KOH with the performance of a small overpotential of 65 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 84.5 mV/dec. 3.1.1.2 Transition metal nitrides Transition metal nitrides have unique physical and chemical properties. On the one hand, the internal nitrogen atom modification changes the nature of the metal d-band leading to the shrinkage of metal d-band, which makes the electronic structure of the transition metal nitride more similar to precious metals (Pd and Pt) [56]. On the other hand, nitrogen atoms are often embedded in the lattice because of the small ionic radius, causing the metal atoms to be arranged in a close packing manner, so that the transition metal nitrides often have good conductivity [57]. At the same time, they generally have high corrosion resistance; therefore, they have a great application value in HER because of their abundant advantages. For example, Gao et al. [58]synthesized the atomically thin metallic Ni3N 2D nanosheets that exhibited the efficient HER activity with a low overpotential of 59 mV at 10 mA/cm2, a high exchange current density of 0.32 mA/cm2, and a low Tafel slope of 59.79 mV/dec in 0.5 M H2SO4. Xie et al. [59]fabricated the atomically-thin MoN nanosheets through ultrasonic exfoliation of bulk MoN in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, which showed the HER activity with a overpotential of 230 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 90 mV/dec in 0.5 M H2SO4. Chen et al. [60]firstly reported the synthesis and application of Ni-Mo bimetallic nitride nanosheets (NiMoNx) in electrocatalytic HER in 2012; the NiMoNx exhibited the high HER activity with the low onset potential of −78 mV and Tafel slope of 35.9 mV/dec in 0.1M HClO4 [60]. Yin et al. [61]synthesized the bimetallic Ni-Mo nitride nanotubes by calcining the NiMoO4 nanotube precursor in an NH3 atmosphere at 550 °C for 2 h, which also showed a superior HER activity with a low overpotential of 89 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a low Tafel slope of 79 mV/dec in 1.0 M KOH. Xue et al. [62]fabricated cobalt nitride porous nanowire arrays on CC, and it exhibited a good HER activity with a low overpotential of 97 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and Tafel of 93.9 mV/dec in 1.0 M KOH. Jia et al. [63]reported the synthesis of Ni3FeN nanoparticles by calcining the ultrathin NiFe-LDH nanosheets precursor in an NH3 atmosphere at 550 °C for 2 h; it can be used in electrocatalytic HER and showed the good HER activity with an overpotentials of 158 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and Tafel of 42 mV/dec in 1.0 M KOH [63]. 3.1.1.3 Transition metal phosphides Transition metal phosphides generally have superior hydrodesulfurization activity, and both hydrodesulfurization and electrocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting have reversible hydrogen atom adsorption and desorption processes. Transition metal phosphides generally have good conductivity and chemical stability, and many reports have shown that transition metal phosphides have superior HER activity. For example, Popczun et al. [64]firstly proved that Ni2P had HER activity from an experimental point of view, by heating the nickel acetylacetonate in 1-octadecene, oleylamine, and tri-n-octylphosphine to 320 °C for 2 h to obtain the Ni2P nanoparticles with the size of about 21 nm and depositing the Ni2P nanoparticles on Ti foil to obtain the Ni2P/Ti electrode which exhibited excellent HER activity with a small overpotential of 96 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope of 46 mV/dec in 0.5 M H2SO4 [64]. Pu et al. [65]used electrodeposition to obtain Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles on Ti sheets, using NaH2PO2 as a phosphorus source to convert Ni(OH)2 into Ni2P nanoparticles by calcination in an Ar atmosphere, and the Ni2P/Ti electrode exhibited excellent HER activity with the overpotentials of 120 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 60 mV/dec in 0.5 M H2SO4 [65]. Cobalt phosphide also has been proven to be a highly efficient HER electrocatalyst, and various morphologies of cobalt phosphide (nanowires, nanosheets, and nanoparticles) were synthesized and used in electrocatalytic HER [66–68]. For example, Tian et al. [67] synthesized the self-supported nanoporous CoP nanowire arrays on CC (CoP/CC) via the phosphidation treatment of the Co(OH)F/CC precursor, which demonstrated the good stability and HER activity with a low overpotential of 67 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope of 51 mV/dec in 0.5 M H2SO4. Moreover, the CoP/CC electrode also showed good HER performances in neutral and basic electrolytes [67]. There are similar FeP-related reports, which showed that it has a certain degree of application in HER [69,70]. For example, Liang et al. [69] fabricated the self-supported FeP nanorod arrays on CC via a low-temperature phosphidation of the Fe2O3 nanorod array precursor, and it exhibited a good HER activity with a low overpotential of 58 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope of 45 mV/dec in 0.5 M H2SO4. Theoretical calculations have shown that molybdenum phosphide has similar properties to Rh and Pd precious metals in HER, Xiao et al. [34] verified the application of molybdenum phosphide in HER. They synthesized the Mo3P and MoP materials with different degrees of phosphorization by controlling the reaction temperature of Mo and P precursors. As shown in Fig. 9 , MoP with a higher P content had a better HER performance with a lower overpotential of 138 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a smaller Tafel slope of 54 mV/dec in 0.5 M H2SO4 than that of Mo3P. 3.1.1.4 Transition metal carbides Transition metal carbides (TMCs, M = Mo, W, V, Ta, Fe, Co, Ni, etc.), with structures consisting of carbon (C) atoms occupying the interstitial sites of their parent metals, have shown impressive catalytic performance toward the HER owing to their high electrical conductivity, excellent chemical stability, wide pH applicability, and earth abundance [71–73]. Furthermore, theory calculations have showed that the d orbitals of M atoms will be broadened with the help of hybridization with s and p orbitals of C atoms, thus forming a similar Pt d-band state and owning the properties of Pt-like electrocatalysts [74]. Therefore, TMCs as the promising catalyst candidates toward the HER have got extensive research. Xiao et al. [75]reported and synthesized the porous molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) nanorods through facile carburization of anilinium molybdate in hydrogen, which exhibited a competitive HER performance in acidic media with a low overpotential of 150 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope of 58 mV/dec (IR drop corrected). Wang et al. [76]synthesized the layer-stacking porous WCx nanoparticles decorated onto CC by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technology using CH4 gas as carbon precursor; the WCx@CC electrode exhibited the good stability and excellent HER performance with a small onset potential of 70 mV, an overpotential of 140 mV at 10 mA/cm2, and Tafel slope of 79 mV/dec in acidic media. Peng et al. [77]synthesized the vanadium carbide nanoparticles encapsulated in graphitic carbon network nanosheets, and it exhibited efficient HER activity with a small Tafel slope of 56 mV/dec and a low overpotential of only 98 mV at 10 mA/cm2 in 0.5 M H2SO4. Other TMCs such as Co2C [78] and Ni3C [79] also show the application in HER. 3.1.1.5 Transition metal borides Transition metal borides also attracted some attention in electrocatalytic HER because of their metallic characters and high stability in both acidic and basic media [80]. The researches about the application of transition metal borides in HER mainly concentrate on Ni- , Fe- , Co- , and Mo-based borides. For example, Chen et al. [81]synthesized the ultrathin nickel boride (NixB) through the reaction between sodium borohydride and nickel nitrate, which exhibited the HER activity with an overpotential of 277 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 152.1 mV/dec in 1.0 M KOH. Furthermore, adding the functionalized carbon nanotubes during the synthesis process of NixB can further improve the HER activity of NixB. Li et al. [82]developed the FeB2 nanoparticles as a HER electrocatalyst through the chemical reduction of Fe2+ using LiBH4 in an organic solvent, which showed a good HER activity with a low overpotential of 61 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 87.5 mV/dec in 1.0 M KOH, and DFT results demonstrated that the boron-rich active sites in FeB2 were beneficial to HER. Chen et al. [83]synthesized the CoB electrocatalyst on Ni foam by a simple electroless plating method and further annealing treatment, and it showed the electrocatalytic activity toward HER with an overpotential of only 110 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 96 mV/dec in 1.0 M KOH. Vrubel and Hu [84]firstly reported the non-precious molybdenum boride (α-MoB) were active HER catalysts in 2012, α-MoB exhibited good HER activity in both acidic and alkaline conditions, and the HER activity of α-MoB in acidic conditions (1M H2SO4) was a little better than that in alkaline conditions (1M KOH) with an overpotential of 212 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 55 mV/dec. Recently, synthesis of bimetallic boride exhibits a better HER activity than single metal boride. For example, Gupta et al. [85]reported the synthesis of Co-Mo-B catalyst by reduction of the mixed solution of cobalt chloride and sodium molybdate using NaBH4; the optimal Co-Mo-B catalyst exhibited a better HER activity than the CoB with a lower overpotential of 66 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a smaller Tafel slope of 67 mV/dec in 1 M NaOH. To give a comprehensive understanding for the mentioned HER electrocatalysts, a brief summary of the important conditions and kinetic parameters is presented in Table 1 . 3.1.2 Research progress in OER electrocatalysts After years of research, many non-noble metal–based OER electrocatalysts have been developed; among them, the metallic oxides, hydroxides, and bifunctional transition metal sulfides, nitrides, phosphides, and borides have received extensive attention. 3.1.2.1 Metallic oxides Perovskites are a large class of materials with ABO3 structure, where A represents alkaline metal or rare earth metal ions and B represents transition metal ions. These kinds of materials have received wide attention because of their low cost, adjustable structural composition, fascinating physical, chemical, and catalytic properties [86]. Recently, they have also demonstrated the application of electrocatalytic OER in alkaline solutions with good activity. For example, Zhu et al. [87]reported the synthesis of SrNb0.1Co0.7Fe0.2O3–δ perovskite nanorods by a facile electrospinning method, and it showed good durability and highly efficient OER activity with a low overpotential of 390 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope of 61 mV/dec in 0.1 M KOH. Wang et al. [88]synthesized a new kind of La0.5Sr0.5Ni0.4Fe0.6O3–δ perovskite catalysts by a typical sol–gel route, which shows good stability and good OER activity with a onset potential of 1.47 V, an overpotential of 352 mV at 10 mA/cm2, and a Tafel slope of 85 mV/dec in 1.0 M KOH. The spinel-type oxides have the structural formula A'B'2O4, which have good electrical conductivity and remain stable at high anodization potentials in alkaline solution, indicating that they are well suitable as OER electrocatalysts [19]. Most of the spinel oxides for OER are composed of ferrite and cobaltate combined with other transition metals/alkali metals ions. For example, Li et al. [89]synthesized a serious of ferrite spinel oxides by electrospinning and reported their applications in electrocatalytic OER, and they also discovered the OER activity tendency among the ferrite spinel oxides (CoFe2O4 > CuFe2O4 > NiFe2O4 > MnFe2O4). Wang et al. [90]synthesized the hierarchical hollow urchin-like NiCo2O4 nanomaterial by using a hard templating method followed by thermal decomposition, and it was used as an OER electrocatalyst in an alkaline medium (1.0 M NaOH) with an overpotential of 419.3 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 51.3 mV/dec. Wang et al. [91] reported the OER application of spinel Co3O4; they found that Co2+ and Co3+ in Co3O4 played different roles in OER, and Co2+ played a more important role in OER. Gao et al. [92] synthesized the hierarchical spinel NiCo2O4 hollow microcuboids constructed by 1D nanowires, which exhibited superior OER activity with a low overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope of 53 mV/dec and good stability. Other metal oxides such as NiO and MnO2 also have been reported as effective OER electrocatalysts [93–95]. 3.1.2.2 Transition metal hydroxides Currently, transition metal hydroxides have also been extensively studied as OER electrocatalysts, which are mainly obtained by the hydrothermal method, chemical precipitation method, and electrodeposition method. Subbaraman et al. [96]systematically studied the OER activity of 3d transition metal (Ni, Co, Fe, Mn) hydroxides and found that the OER activity trend of these hydroxides was Ni > Co > Fe > Mn; the increasing OER activities were derived from the decreasing strength of the OHad-Mn+ interaction (Ni < Co < Fe < Mn, M as the transition metal sites). Jiang et al. [97] reported that the growth of Co(OH)2 on the carbon nanotube/polyimide film can be used as an efficient electrocatalyst for OER, which afforded a low overpotential of 317 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope of 49 mV/dec in 1.0 M KOH. Kong et al. [98]synthesized the free-standing holey Ni(OH)2 nanosheets by a sol–gel method. Because of the holey structure which could provide more channels for ions adsorption and interfacial charge transfer, it showed a good OER activity with a low overpotential of 335 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope of 65 mV/dec in 1.0 M KOH. LDHs are a class of clays with brucite-like layers and intercalated anions [99]. Recently, the earth-abundant 3d transition metal (especially Fe, Co, Ni, and V) LDHs have exhibited superior OER activities in alkaline media because of their special structures, and NiV, NiFe, and CoFe-LDH are the most typical representatives among them [32]. Fan et al. [100] reported a monolayer of NiV-LDHs that showed a current density of 27 mA/cm2 at an overpotential of 350 mV and a Tafel slope of 50 mV/dec in 1.0 M KOH for water oxidation without ohmic-drop correction; mechanistic studies indicated the superior high intrinsic catalytic activity was attributed to the enhanced conductivity, good electron transfer, and abundant active sites in NiV-LDHs [100]. Lu et al. [101]synthesized the three-dimensional NiFe-LDH nanosheets on nickel foam. Because of the inherently high activity and unique three-dimensional structure, NiFe-LDH nanosheets exhibited a low OER onset potential; the overpotential required at a current density of 30 mA/cm2 was only 280 mV, and its Tafel slope was 50 mV/dec in 0.1 M KOH. These OER performances were even better than the commercial 20 wt% Ir/C catalyst. Yu et al. [102] deposited CoFe-LDH on Cu nanowires by electrodeposition; the hierarchical Cu@CoFe LDH core–shell nanostructure had large surface area and active sites, which facilitated electron transport and gas release, thus achieving high OER activity with a low overpotential of 240 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope of 44.4 mV/dec in 1.0 M KOH. The other layered double hydroxides such as NiCo-LDHs, NiMn-LDHs, and CoMn-LDHs also have been reported as good electrocatalysts for OER [103–105]. 3.1.2.3 Bifunctional transition metal sulfides, nitrides, phosphides, and borides Bifunctional materials which can be used in both HER and OER have received a lot of attention, focusing on transition metal sulfides, nitrides, phosphides, and borides. Compared with transition metal oxides and hydroxides, they have better conductivity which is beneficial to OER. For example, Zhang et al. [106]synthesized the MoS2/Ni3S2 heterojunction, which showed the excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 218 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 88 mV/dec in 1.0 M KOH. Ouyang et al. [107]synthesized the hierarchically porous Ni3S2 nanorod array on Ni foam through hydrothermal sulfidizing of the calcined Ni foam in thiourea solution, and it can be used as the OER electrocatalyst which showed the OER activity with a low overpotential of 217 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 107 mV/dec in 1.0 M KOH. Sivanantham et al. [108] reported the synthesis of hierarchical NiCo2S4 nanowire arrays by hydrothermal sulfidizing of the Ni-Co-carbonates hydroxide precursor in Na2S solution, and it exhibited the good OER activity with a low overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 40.1 mV/dec in 1.0 M KOH. Zhang et al. [109]prepared Ni3FeN on Ni foam by calcining the NiFe(OH)x precursor at 500 °C for 2 h in NH3 atmosphere, which showed the excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 202 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope of 40 mV/dec in 1.0 M KOH. Tang et al. [110]synthesized Fe-doped CoP nanowire arrays on Ti foil, which required a low overpotential of 230 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope of 67 mV/dec in 1.0 M KOH during OER. Xiong et al. [111] reported the synthesis of FeP nanorods by a phosphorization of iron oxyhydroxide precursors, and it showed the durable and efficient OER activity with an overpotential of 350 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 63.6 mV/dec in 1.0 M KOH. As mentioned in HER, Fe2B can also be used in electrocatalytic OER, it demonstrated a good OER activity with an overpotential of 296 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 52.4 mV/dec in 1.0 M KOH [82]. However, these materials are inherently unstable at high anode potentials, and their surfaces are easily converted to the corresponding hydroxides or oxyhydroxides during the OER process. These oxide layers can protect the inner core from further oxidation and supply the active sites for OER. To give a comprehensive understanding for the mentioned OER electrocatalysts, a brief summary of the important conditions and kinetic parameters is presented in Table 2 ."
8,Research progress in photocatalysts for hydrogen production from water splitting,"3.2 Research progress in photocatalysts for hydrogen production from water splitting Photocatalytic water splitting is the most promising hydrogen production technology, which can continuously convert solar energy into clean hydrogen energy. Therefore, photocatalysts for water splitting have been extensively explored, mainly including metal oxides, sulfides, and nitride semiconductor materials. 3.2.1 Metal oxide photocatalysts TiO2 with the bandgap of about 3.2 eV is the first reported photocatalyst that can split water to produce hydrogen under ultraviolet light irradiation, and it has attracted much attention because of its low cost, environmental friendliness, and stable physical and chemical properties. TiO2 has three crystal structures: rutile, brookite, and anatase. Among them, rutile and anatase TiO2 exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production. Yu et al. [112]reported the synthesis of anatase TiO2 with a high-exposure (001) crystal plane, and it exhibited excellent photocatalytic H2 production performance of 16.675 mmol/h/g under simulated sunlight irradiation by loading Pt as a cocatalyst and using ethanol as a sacrificial agent. ZnO with the bandgap of about 3.37 eV also had the application in photocatalytic H2 production. For example, Peng et al. [113]prepared the Pt-loaded ZnO nanoparticles and studied its photocatalytic H2 production activity in different sacriflcial reagents (triethanolamine [TEOA] and methanol) under Xe-lamp irradiation; the results showed that it had a better H2 production performance in methanol solution (5.4 μmol/h/g) than in TEOA solution [113]. Other oxide semiconductors such as SrTiO3 and Ga2O3 also exhibit a certain degree of photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production [114,115]. However, these metal oxide photocatalysts generally have wide bandgaps (>3.0 eV), which can only absorb ultraviolet light that is about 4% in the solar spectrum. Therefore, the solar light cannot be effectively utilized, which limits their application to some extent. Recently, some metal oxide semiconductors with visible-light absorption also exhibited the application in photocatalytic H2 production. For example, Manikandan et al. [116] synthesized the mixed-valence Sn3O4 (co-existence of Sn2+ and Sn4+) with a narrower bandgap of 2.4 eV, which showed the photocatalytic H2 production activity of 16.67 μmol/h/g under visible-light irradiation (λ > 400 nm) with the help of Pt as a cocatalyst and methanol as a sacriflcial reagent [116]. Zhang et al. [117] reported the synthesis of Cu2O-octapods particles with a narrower bandgap of about 1.9 eV; it showed the photocatalytic H2 production activity of 7.255 mmol/h/g under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) with methanol as a sacriflcial reagent. Kong et al. [118] prepared the visible light–responsive InVO4 photocatalyst (absorption edge at 532 nm); with the help of MoS2 as the cocatalyst and methanol as a sacriflcial reagent, it exhibited the photocatalytic H2 activity of 200.67 μmol/h/g under visible-light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). 3.2.2 Metal sulfide photocatalysts Metal sulfides generally have suitable energy band positions and good light absorption; therefore, they are widely concerned in photocatalytic hydrogen production. CdS as a typical sulfide semiconductor has a bandgap of about 2.4 eV, and it has the good light absorption and suitable band position with enough reduction ability for H2 production. When loaded with the suitable cocatalyst, CdS can exhibit the excellent performance in photocatalytic H2 production. For example, Yan et al. [119]reported the synthesis of CdS photocatalyst modified with Pt and PdS cocatalysts; its hydrogen production rate reached 29.24 mmol/h/g in Na2S and Na2SO3 solution under visible-light irradiation. In addition, it exhibited a quantum efficiency of 93% under 420 nm. Li et al. [120]synthesized the almost vertical 1D/2D CdS/MoS2 heterostructure by adding glucose in the synthetic process, which exhibited high photocatalytic H2 production activity under visible-light irradiation with a hydrogen production rate of 9.73 mmol/h/g and quantum efficiency of 60.3% at 420 nm in Na2S and Na2SO3 solution. With the expansion of sulfide systems, a series of metal sulfide solid solutions with an adjustable component have been synthesized and exhibited excellent photocatalytic hydrogen H2 performance. For example, Li et al. [121] synthesized a series of Zn1-xCdxS solid solutions; as shown in Fig. 10 , the solid solutions with different components had different light absorption ability, and their energy band positions can be adjusted. The optimal Zn0.5Cd0.5S without a cocatalyst exhibited the excellent visible-light photocatalytic H2 production performance of 7.42 mmol/h/g in Na2S and Na2SO3 solution [121]. Huang et al. [122]synthesized the twinning Cd0.6Zn0.4S solid solution integrated with wurtzite–sphalerite phase junctions and rich sulfur vacancies, and it exhibited remarkable visible-light photocatalytic H2 production performance of 42.66 mmol/h/g and quantum efficiency of 18% at 420 nm without a cocatalyst in Na2S and Na2SO3 solution. Other metal sulfides solid solutions such as Mn1-xCdxS and (CuIn)xZn2(1-x)S2 also have the applications in photocatalytic H2 production [123,124]. Besides these, other metal sulfides such as ZnIn2S4 and In2S3 with good light absorption also exhibited the photocatalytic H2 production activity [125,126]. For example, Chai et al. [125]synthesized a series of ZnIn2S4 floriated microspheres by a facile hydrothermal method, and they found that the hydrothermal temperature and pH value could strongly influence the crystal structures, morphologies, and light absorption of ZnIn2S4; the ZnIn2S4 floriated microspheres prepared hydrothermally at 160 °C with pH = 1.00 had the optimal visible-light photocatalytic H2 production activity of 8.42 mmol/h/g and quantum efficiency of 34.3% at 420 nm with 1.0 wt% Pt as a cocatalyst in Na2S and Na2SO3 solution [125]. Although metal sulfide photocatalysts generally have good photocatalytic H2 production activity, the photocorrosion phenomenon may exist under light irradiation because S2− in sulfide photocatalysts is easily oxidized by photogenerated holes, the photocorrosion of photocatalysts leads to a decrease in photocatalytic H2 production activity. Although many experiments have been carried out by adding Na2S/Na2SO3 as the sacrificial agent to reduce the photocorrosion, more protection measures still need to be explored. 3.2.3 Nitride and oxynitride photocatalysts Since 2009, Wang et al. [127]has reported for the first time that graphite phase carbonitride (g-C3N4) has the photocatalytic H2 production activity under visible-light irradiation; the g-C3N4 photocatalyst has been extensively studied in photocatalytic water splitting. Among many carbon nitride allotropes, g-C3N4 is considered to be the most stable one, and the π-conjugated graphite-like layer formed by the sp2 hybridization between C and N makes it to have the smallest direct band structure [128]. The structure of g-C3N4 is a two-dimensional framework consisting of an N-bridged triazine ring (Fig. 11 ), which gives it high thermal stability and chemical stability [129]. In the two-dimensional structure of g-C3N4, the layers are connected by Van der Waals forces. G-C3N4 is usually obtained by thermal polycondensation of nitrogen-rich precursors such as urea, dicyandiamide, and melamine; the synthesis method is simple, and the raw materials are inexpensive [130]. The g-C3N4 is a visible light–responsive polymer semiconductor with an energy band of about 2.7 eV, and the corresponding optical absorption band edge is about 460 nm [131]. The CB and VB positions of g-C3N4 span the oxidation and reduction potentials required for water splitting, and the low reduction potential of CB is very favorable for photocatalytic H2 production [132]. For example, Li et al. [133]synthesized the macroscopic foam-like holey ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets through a long-time calcination of bulk g-C3N4 in air; the ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets with a large Brunner−Emmet−Teller (BET) surface area of 277.98 m2/g exhibited the good visible-light photocatalytic H2 production of 2.86 mmol/h/g and quantum efficiency of 4.03% at 420 nm with the assistance of Pt as a cocatalyst and triethanolamine as a sacrificial agent [133]. Luo et al. [134] synthesized the ultrasmall CoP cocatalyst particle–modified g-C3N4 nanosheets by phosphating of the Co3O4 quantum dots/g-C3N4; it showed a good visible-light photocatalytic H2 production activity of 1.074 mmol/h/g and quantum efficiency of 6.1% at 420 nm in triethanolamine solution [134]. Ta3N5 with a greater light absorption ability than g-C3N4 has been synthesized, and its band gap is about 2.1 eV. Its CB position is negative than the potential required for H2 production, which can be used for photocatalytic H2 production. For example, Yuliati et al. [135]used mesoporous carbon nitride as template to synthesize the high-efficiency Ta3N5 nanoparticles for visible-light photocatalytic H2 production from water splitting. The synthesized Ta3N5 has a high specific surface area and low defect density; therefore, its photocatalytic H2 production activity (136 μmol/h/g) was almost an order of magnitude higher than that of bulk Ta3N5 (14.6 μmol/h/g) [135]. Ta3N5 can also be used as a photoelectrode to realize hydrogen production by the photoelectrochemical water splitting. Li et al. [136]synthesized the vertically aligned Ta3N5 nanorod arrays used for photoelectrochemical water splitting, which exhibited excellent photoelectric conversion efficiency. In addition to nitrides, metal oxynitrides have also exhibited the application in photocatalytic H2 production. For example, Chen et al. [137] reported the synthesis of the Ni(OH)2-modified TaON photocatalyst, where Ni(OH)2 is the cocatalyst, and its application in photocatalytic H2 production, and the Ni(OH)2/TaON composite showed the visible-light photocatalytic H2 production activity of 31.5 μmol/h/g with methanol as a sacrificial reagent. Luo et al. [138] synthesized the BaTaO2N with co-exposed (100) and (110) facets by the one-pot flux-assisted nitridation approach; because of the effective charge transfer between the different crystal plane, this BaTaO2N exhibited nearly 10-fold higher photocatalytic H2 production (32 μmol/h/g) than that of BaTaO2N with only (100) facet with methanol as a sacrificial reagent [138]. To give a comprehensive understanding for the mentioned HER photocatalysts, a brief summary of the important conditions and activity parameters is presented in Table 3 ."
9,Surface/interfacial regulation methods in electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting for efficient hydrogen production,"It is well known that almost all catalytic reactions are carried out on the surfaces and interfaces of the catalysts; the possible surfaces and interfaces illustration of catalysts are shown in Fig. 12 [139]. Therefore, the surface and interfacial conditions of the catalysts (component, structure, morphology, defects, active sites, etc) will strongly affect their catalytic activities. Reasonable surface and interfacial regulation of the electrocatalysts can effectively increase the number of active sites, optimize the adsorption and desorption processes of intermediates, improve the conductivity, and promote the charge transfer. Reasonable surface and interfacial regulation of the photocatalysts can effectively expand light absorption, increase the number of active sites, and promote the separation of photogenerated carriers. Therefore, surface and interfacial regulation is of great significance for the improvement of both electrocatalytic and photocatalytic H2 production from water splitting. Tables 4 and 5 summarized the reaction conditions and kinetic and activity parameters of the mentioned HER electrocatalysts and photocatalysts in the surface and interfacial regulation strategies."
10,Morphology regulation,"4.1 Morphology regulation Morphology regulation and control as a method of surface/interfacial regulation is very important for electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting. Changes in surface morphology of the catalyst can cause a series of changes in specific surface area, size, charge carrier transport path, the number of reactive sites, etc., which have significant impacts on the catalytic activity. Therefore, morphology regulation of the electrocatalysts and photocatalysts is an important way to optimize their water splitting activity for H2 production. 4.1.1 Morphology regulation in electrocatalytic water splitting MoS2 has a wide range of applications in electrocatalytic HER, but the bulk MoS2 often exhibits poor HER activity. Many researches have reported that the morphology regulation of MoS2 could effectively improve the electrocatalytic HER performance relative to the bulk MoS2. For example, Wang et al. [140]successfully converted the bulk MoS2 into distorted MoS2 nanosheets structure by high-energy ball milling technology. The obtained MoS2 nanosheets could expose more surface active sites; therefore, its electrocatalytic HER activity got a great improvement (onset potential of 103 mV and a Tafel slope of 104 mV/dec) comparing with the bulk MoS2 (onset potential of 203 mV and Tafel slope of 164 mV/dec) under the same test conditions in 0.5 M H2SO4 [140]. Similarly, Ji et al. [141]dispersed the bulk MoS2 in DMF and used ultrasound method to obtain thin-layered MoS2 nanosheets; its electrocatalytic HER performance with an overpotential of 215 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 65 mV/dec were far superior to those of the bulk MoS2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 [141]. Our group synthesized the MoS2/Ni3S2 heterostructure with different morphologies through using different sulfur sources (thioacetamide, L-cysteine and thiourea) during the synthesis; we found that MoS2/Ni3S2 heterostructure synthesized by thioacetamide as the sulfur source with the morphology of Ni3S2 nanorods wrapped in MoS2 nanosheets had the best HER activity 1.0 M KOH (the lowest overpotential of 91 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and Tafel slope of 48.62 mV/dec) because of its abundant active sites and favorable carrier transport [142]. Zhai et al. [143]synthesized the heterogeneous MoS2/NiS electrocatalyst with different morphologies (aggregations, nanowires, and nanocuboids) by controlled addition of dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate and cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide as surfactants; among them, the MoS2/NiS nanocuboid showed the optimal HER activity with the lowest overpotential of 92 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and Tafel slope of 113 mV/dec because of its enlarged surface areas and active sites [143]. Devaguptapu et al. [144]reported the synthesis of NiCo2O4 with different morphologies (nanoneedles, sphere-like, and flowerlike structures) using temple-free, SiO2 hard template and Pluronic-123 (P-123) soft template, respectively, via the hydrothermal method followed by calcination, as shown in Fig. 13 a; among them, the flowerlike nanoneedle assembly NiCo2O4 catalyst exhibited the highest OER catalytic activity and stability because of its three-dimensional architecture with increased surface areas and mass transfer [144]. Faber et al. [145]synthesized the CoS2 with three morphologies (thin film, microwires, and nanowires) and studied the influence of different morphologies on HER activity in detail (Fig. 13b), and they found that microstructures and nanostructures could increase the effective surface area of the electrode and accelerate the release of hydrogen bubbles from the electrode surface, which can reduce the overpotential of HER and improve the mechanical stability of CoS2 electrode [145]. The control of crystal plane is also a kind of morphology regulation, and the different exposed crystal planes show different water splitting performance. Exploring the synthetic method for the electrocatalyst with a high-exposed active crystal plane is an effective way to improve its electrocatalytic water splitting activity. Feng et al. [51]first reported that Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays exposing the { 2 ¯ 10} high-index facet on nickel foam showed higher HER activity with an overpotential of 170 mV at 10 mA/cm2 than that of Ni3S2 nanoparticles with an overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mA/cm2 under neutral media (pH 7); theoretical and experimental analysis exhibited that the superior activity was attributed to the synergistic catalytic effects of the nanosheet arrays and exposed { 2 ¯ 10} high-index facets [51]. Dong et al. [146] synthesized a (003) crystal face–exposed Ni3S2 nanoporous film on a nickel foil by a two-step process (first anodizing and then vapor phase sulfidizing), which reached a current density of 10 mA/cm2 with the overpotentials of 135 mV and showed a low Tafel slope of 75.7 mV/dec during alkaline HER; their superior activity was attributed to the nanoporous morphology and the exposed (003) crystal face [146]. Therefore, it can be seen that the reasonable morphology regulation of the electrocatalysts can optimize these parameters such as surface area, size, exposed crystal face, and the number of reaction active sites, which can improve the electrocatalytic water splitting activity. Therefore, the morphology regulation can play an important role in optimizing the performance of electrocatalytic water splitting for H2 production. 4.1.2 Morphology regulation in photocatalytic water splitting Morphology regulation is equally important in photocatalytic H2 production from water splitting. For examples, Yu et al. [147] synthesized a series of CdS with various morphologies by adjusting the sulfur sources and solvents used in the synthetic process and studied the influence of morphologies on the photocatalytic H2 production activity in detail. When ethylenediamine was used as a solvent, and using thiourea, thioacetamide, and L-cysteine as sulfur sources could produce nanorods, nanowires, and urchin-like shape of CdS, respectively; among them, urchin-like CdS had the best H2 production activity (13.1 mmol/h/g) because of its unique microstructure and large specific surface area. Furthermore, using L-cysteine as the sulfur source to optimize the solvent selection, it was found that when tetraethylenepentamine was used as the solvent, the produced CdS nanorods with about 1 μm in length and 22 nm in diameter had the highest photocatalytic H2 production performance of 16.06 mmol/h/g with a quantum efficiency of 37.7% at 420 nm among all samples; it is because these CdS nanorods with small diameter could facilitate the migration of photogenerated carriers to the surface active sites quickly. Yuliati et al. [135] used mesoporous carbon nitride as a template to synthesize Ta3N5 nanoparticles for photocatalytic H2 production under visible light. The synthesized Ta3N5 had high specific surface area and low defect density; therefore, its photocatalytic H2 production activity (136 μmol/h/g) was almost an order of magnitude higher than that of bulk Ta3N5 (14.6 μmol/h/g) [135]. Niu et al. [148] synthesized the ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets (2 nm) with a high specific surface area (BET) of 306 m2/g through thermal oxidation etching of the bulk g-C3N4 at 500 °C for 2 h in air; the obtained ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets showed a significantly improved UV–visible light photocatalytic H2 production activity of 3,410 μmol/h/g than that of the bulk g-C3N4 (631.5 μmol/h/g) because of the large BET and improved electron transport ability [148]. The control of the crystal plane is also an effective method among morphology regulation to improve the photocatalytic H2 production. Generally, exposed crystal face with high unsaturated coordinating atoms should exhibit good photocatalytic activity. In 2010, Yu et al. [112]reported the synthesis of TiO2 with the high-exposed (001) crystal plane, by using Pt as the cocatalyst and ethanol as the sacrificial agent; it exhibited superior photocatalytic H2 production activity of 16.675 mmol/h/g even better than that of commercial P25 (11.17 mmol/h/g) [112]. Pan et al. [149] synthesized the three kinds of anatase TiO2 which were respectively dominant exposure in {001}, {101}, and {010} crystal faces by controlling the ratio of TiOSO4 to HF and the time of hydrothermal reaction, as shown in Fig. 14 a–d. It was experimentally proved that the order of photocatalytic H2 production of different crystal faces was {001} < {101} < {010} (Fig. 14e and f), which was different from the traditional viewpoint that {001} crystal face–exposed TiO2 has the best activity. The authors proposed a new mechanism that different crystal faces exposure could cause changes in the surface and electronic structure of the photocatalyst, causing the differences in the redox ability and photocatalytic H2 production activity [149]. Therefore, the reasonable morphology regulation can play an important role in optimizing the photocatalytic water splitting performance. Development and synthesis of photocatalysts with large BET, good charge transfer paths, and more exposed reaction active sites can effectively improve the photocatalytic H2 production activity."
11,Doping and surface defects construction,"4.2 Doping and surface defects construction Doping and construction of surface defects are the effective ways to improve the performances of electrocatalysts and photocatalysts, which can optimize and adjust the electronic structure, improve the conductivity, and increase the surface active sites of catalysts. 4.2.1 Doping and surface defects construction in electrocatalytic water splitting In electrocatalytic water splitting, doping is an effective method to improve the activity. Effective and reasonable doping can adjust the electronic structures, improve the conductivity, and optimize the adsorption and desorption process of the reaction intermediates on the surface of electrocatalysts. For example, Zhang et al. [150]reported the applications of Fe- , Co- , and Ni-doped MoS2 in alkaline electrocatalytic HER; they found that all Fe, Co, and Ni doping could improve the HER activity of pristine MoS2 (an overpotential of 308 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and Tafel slope of 201 mV/dec), and among them, Ni-doped MoS2 showed the best HER activity with an extremely low overpotential of 98 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and Tafel slope of 60 mV/dec (Fig. 15 a and b); in addition to the improved conductivity by Ni doping, the experimental and DFT calculation (Fig. 15c) results showed that Ni doping in MoS2 nanosheets could efficiently lower the kinetic energy barrier of the initial water dissociation step, promote the desorption of the formed OH− from the catalyst surface, and optimal the adsorption free energy of H∗ [150]. From theoretical calculation results, Zhang et al. [151] found that Mn doping into CoS2 could obtain the most favorable hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (ΔGH∗), and the increased density of states near the Fermi level of CoS2 caused by Mn doping indicated that the conductivity got further promotion which was beneficial to the electrons transfer in HER; the experimental results further verified that the Mn-doped CoS2 nanowires had a significant improvement in HER activity with a lower overpotential of 43 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a smaller Tafel slope of only 34 mV/dec than the initial CoS2 nanowires with an overpotential of 187 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 87 mV/dec in 0.5 M H2SO4 [151]. The roles of reasonable doping in electrocatalytic HER are mainly to improve the conductivity of the electrocatalyst, adjust the electronic structure of the electrocatalyst, and optimize the adsorption and desorption of the reaction intermediate on the surface of the electrocatalyst. Many similar studies about doping in the improvement of electrocatalytic HER were also reported, such as Mo-doped Ni3FeN, V-doped Co4N, and N-doped Ni3S2 [152–154]. Construction of surface defects is also an important method in the surface and interfacial regulation strategy, such as oxygen vacancy defects, which can improve the conductivity and increase the active sites of electrocatalysts. For examples, Zhang et al. [155]synthesized the NiO nanorods with abundant surface oxygen vacancies by a mild cation exchange method; the theoretical and experimental results indicated that the existence of surface oxygen vacancies could significantly enhance the conductivity and promote the HER reaction kinetics of the NiO nanorods, which exhibited the excellent HER activity with a lower overpotential of 110 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a smaller Tafel slope of 100 mV/dec than that of NiO with poor oxygen vacancies (a overpotential of 160 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 170 mV/dec) under alkaline conditions [155]. Luo et al. [156]synthesized mesoporous MoO3–x and exhibited the outstanding HER activity in acidic or alkaline electrolytes; the authors explained that the excellent HER activity was attributed to the internal pores (20–40 nm) which was beneficial to the charge transfer, and oxygen vacancies that could narrow the bandgap and improve the conductivity. In addition, the oxygen vacancies near Mo5+ were also considered to be the active sites of HER [156]. Xu et al. [157] designed an efficient Co3O4-based OER electrocatalyst with high surface area and abundant oxygen vacancies on the surface by a plasma engraving strategy; the generated oxygen vacancies on Co3O4 surface played important roles for the enhanced OER activity, which could improve the conductivity and create more active defects for OER [157]. In addition to the oxygen vacancies, other vacancies have also been reported in electrocatalytic water splitting; for example, Liu et al. [158] reported the synthesis of ultrathin CoSe2 nanosheets with atomic thickness, which showed the excellent OER activity with a lower overpotential of 320 mV and a smaller Tafel slope of 44 mV/dec than the bulk CoSe2. They proved that theCo vacancies formed in the ultrathin CoSe2 nanosheets could effectively serve as active sites to promote the OER activity [158]. 4.2.2 Doping and surface defects construction in photocatalytic water splitting Reasonable doping is an effective method for improving the photocatalytic water splitting performance by expanding the light absorption and promoting the separation of photogenerated carriers. For examples, Zhang et al. [159] synthesized the interior and surface Cu-doped ZnxCd1-xS solid solutions, respectively; the experimental results showed that both the two doping methods could enhance the photocatalytic H2 production activity and the surface Cu-doped ZnxCd1-xS had a better enhancement effect. The authors explained that the enhanced H2 production activity of interior Cu-doped ZnxCd1-xS was due to the introduction of a new donor level populated by partially filled Cu 3d orbitals above the VB of ZnxCd1-xS and a broadened light absorption range; the enhanced H2 production activity of surface Cu-doped ZnxCd1-xS was due to the generation of a new electrons transfer path (electrons directly transfer from the valence band of ZnxCd1-xS to surface CuS particles) and the rapid participation of photogenerated electrons in the H2 production through the active sites (CuS particles). Wang et al. [160]synthesized the surface P-doped g-C3N4 through the heat treatment of the mixture of NaH2PO2 and g-C3N4; P doping could cause the increased light absorption, upshifted CB position with improved reduction potential and effective separation of photogenerated carriers in g-C3N4. Therefore, the P-doped g-C3N4 exhibited the significantly improved photocatalytic H2 production activity of 916.2 μmol/g/h (quantum efficiency of 6.52% at 420 nm), which was about two times higher than that of the pristine g-C3N4 [160]. Construction of reasonable surface defects has been widely studied in photocatalytic water splitting, which can be an effective method for the enhanced photocatalytic H2 production. For example, Tan et al. [161]treated the mixed SrTiO3 and NaBH4 at different temperatures in the Ar atmosphere to obtain a series of SrTiO3 with different levels of surface oxygen vacancies; the produced surface oxygen vacancies could significantly enhance the photocatalytic H2 production activity of the original SrTiO3 (as shown in Fig. 16 ). The authors thought that the oxygen vacancies expanded the light absorption range and promoted the separation of photogenerated carriers, which were the reasons for the improvement of photocatalytic H2 production activity [161]. Zuo et al. [162] calcined a mixture of ethanol, hydrochloric acid, titanium isopropoxide, and 2-methylimidazole in air at 500 °C for 5 h to obtain the blue TiO2-x with abundant oxygen vacancies, and the introduction of oxygen vacancies could shorten the energy bandgap and expand the light absorption range which was beneficial to the improvement of visible-light photocatalytic H2 production. In addition to oxygen vacancies, the surface sulfur vacancies could also play an important role for the improvement of photocatalytic H2 production. For example, Zhang et al. [163]synthesized Zn-Cd-S solid solution with surface sulfur vacancies in hydrazine hydrate, and surface sulfur vacancies in Zn-Cd-S solid solution could shorten the band gap and expand the light absorption range, which caused a four-fold enhanced photocatalytic H2 production activity than that of Zn-Cd-S solid solution without sulfur vacancies. In a similar report, Wang et al. [164] synthesized the ZnS with controllable sulfur vacancies, which could expand its light absorption range from ultraviolet light to visible light and greatly enhance the visible-light photocatalytic H2 production performance than that of pure ZnS without sulfur vacancies. Huang et al. [122]reported that the twining Cd0.6Zn0.4S solid solution with rich sulfur vacancies showed a remarkable visible-light photocatalytic H2 production activity (42.66 mmol/g/h) with Na2S/Na2SO3 solution as a sacrificial agent; the surface sulfur vacancies were a benefit to the absorption of sacrificial agent (S2−) and the consumption of photogenerated holes, which improved the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers [122]. Therefore, it can be seen that the design of doping and surface defects plays a very important role in improving the photocatalytic H2 production from water splitting."
12,Heterojunction construction,"4.3 Heterojunction construction Heterojunction construction is the most important method in interfacial regulation engineering for electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting, which can optimize the interface structure, improve the adsorption and desorption abilities of intermediates on the catalyst surface during electrocatalytic water splitting, and accelerate the rapid transfer and effective separation of photogenerated carriers during photocatalytic water splitting. 4.3.1 Heterojunction construction in electrocatalytic water splitting Heterojunction construction is widely used in electrocatalytic water splitting, and it can optimize the interfacial property and make full use of the advantages of the two kinds of electrocatalysts. For examples, Yang et al. [165]synthesized a self-supported MoS2-Ni3S2 heterojunction on Ni foam, and Ni3S2 nanorods and ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets constituted a three dimensional hierarchical heterostructure that exhibited a superior electrocatalytic water splitting activity in 1.0 M KOH (the overpotential required for HER to reach 10 mA/cm2 is 98 mV, Tafel slope is 61 mV/dec; and the overpotential required for OER to reach 10 mA/cm2 is 249 mV, Tafel slope is 57 mV/dec). The excellent activity of MoS2-Ni3S2 heterojunction is attributed to the favorable interface which is beneficial for the absorption and desorption of H and O intermediates, more exposed active sites, and the favorable charge transport along 1D Ni3S2 nanorods immobilized on Ni foam [165]. Chen et al. [166]successfully synthesized the 1T-VS2@MoS2 heterojunction by a two-step method; the metal phase VS2 promoted the efficient charge transfer, and MoS2 with more exposed edge sites can act as the active sites for the electrocatalytic HER. The synergistic effect in the 1T-VS2@MoS2 heterojunction realized a superior electrocatalytic HER activity with a low overpotential of 177 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope of 54.9 mV/dec. Similar report shows that the MoS2 nanosheet–modified CoS2 nanowire heterojunction exhibited an excellent electrocatalytic HER activity than MoS2 or CoS2 alone [167]. In addition to these, some other reports on heterojunctions include the optimization of the absorption and desorption process of H2O, H, or O intermediate through interface engineering, which can promote the kinetics of the catalytic reaction. For examples, Zhang et al. [168] reported the synthesis of Ni(OH)2/MoS2 heterojunctions with rich active interfaces which could achieve a better alkaline HER activity (ηoneset is 20 mV, η10 is 80 mV and Tafel slope is 60 mV/dec) than that of MoS2 alone, as shown in Fig. 17. Furthermore, the DFT calculation was used in the key reaction steps of electrocatalytic HER to study the synergistic effect of Ni(OH)2/MoS2 heterojunction, as shown in Fig. 18; the Ni(OH)2/MoS2 heterojunction exhibited less water-activated adsorption free energy (ΔGH2O) and hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH) in both the Ni(OH)2/MoS2 interface and the MoS2 side or Ni(OH)2 side in Ni(OH)2/MoS2 heterojunction. Therefore, the construction of the Ni(OH)2/MoS2 heterojunction can effectively reduce the kinetic barrier of the initial water splitting step and hydrogen intermediate desorption and aggregation [168]. Similar reports include the Ni(OH)2–Ni3N nanosheet heterojunction [169], Co(OH)2@MoS2 heterojunction [170], and so on, which showed the similar mechanism for the enhanced HER activity. 4.3.2 Heterojunction construction in photocatalytic water splitting During the photocatalytic water splitting for H2 production, construction of suitable heterojunction is a widely studied topic, which can effectively promote the separation of photogenerated carriers and improve the photocatalytic H2 production activity [171]. Usually, the formation of type II heterojunction with staggered band structure is beneficial to the photogenerated carrier separation. As shown in Fig. 19 , photocatalyst I (PS I) and photocatalyst II (PS II) are excited by light with enough energy (hv > Eg), the photogenerated electrons in the CB of PS I can transfer to the CB of PS II, and the photogenerated holes in the VB of PS II can transfer to the VB of PS I because of the staggered band structure, which can effectively improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers. Meanwhile, the interface of heterojunction plays an important role in photocatalysis, because it is the only way for photogenerated carrier transfer. Close contact and good matching interfaces is good for facilitating the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers. For examples, Hu et al. [172]deposited InVO4 nanoparticles (20 nm) on g-C3N4 nanosheets to form a close-contact g-C3N4/InVO4 type II heterojunction by the hydrothermal method; because of the staggered energy band positions of g-C3N4 and nano-InVO4, the formed interface electric field and closely contacted heterogeneous interface effectively promoted the separation and transfer of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, which greatly improved the photocatalytic H2 production activity of g-C3N4 or InVO4 alone [172]. Zhang et al. [173] synthesized a core–shell CdS/g-C3N4 heterojunction by the spontaneous adsorption of g-C3N4 on the CdS nanowire (Fig. 20 a–c), which can achieve the efficient separation of photogenerated carriers under visible light because of the formation of close-contact type II heterojunction, as shown in Fig. 20d [173]. Therefore, the photocatalytic H2 production activity got improved in the CdS/g-C3N4 heterojunction system (Fig. 20e), which is higher than that of g-C3N4 alone; more importantly, the photocorrosion of CdS can be effectively inhibited by the transfer of photogenerated holes from the VB of CdS to the VB of g-C3N4, and the stability of CdS/g-C3N4 heterojunction was improved. Other similar reports include the AgIn5S8/TiO2 heterojunction [174], TiO2/g-C3N4 heterojunction [175], ZnS/g-C3N4 heterojunction [176], and so on, which all exhibited the enhanced photocatalytic H2 production activities. The p–n junction is also one kind of semiconductor heterojunctions, as shown in Fig. 21 a. When the p-type and n-type semiconductors contact with each other, carrier diffusion occurs at the contacted interface because of the different Fermi levels, the electrons in the n-type semiconductor will diffuse into the p-type semiconductor, and the holes in the p-type semiconductor will diffuse into the n-type semiconductor; the diffusion of the electrons and holes will continue till the Fermi level of the system reaches equilibrium. Because of the diffusion, a space charge region is formed at the interface, called the built-in electric field, and the direction of the electric field is directed to the p-type semiconductor [177]. When the p–n junction is irradiated by light with enough energy, the semiconductors are excited and produce the photogenerated electrons and holes; under the driving of the built-in electric field, the photogenerated electrons in the CB of the p-type semiconductor will rapidly migrate to the CB of the n-type semiconductor, and the photogenerated holes in the VB of n-type semiconductor will rapidly migrate to the VB of p-type semiconductor, which can effectively promote the spatial separation of the photogenerated carriers and improve the photocatalytic activity. For examples, Chen et al. [178]successfully grew p-type Cu2S on n-type CdS by in situ deposition and constructed many nanoscale p–n junctions (Fig. 21b), the photogenerated carriers were effectively separated because of the built-in electric field (Fig. 21c); therefore, the photocatalytic H2 production activity of CdS was greatly enhanced (Fig. 21d). In addition, the authors loaded p-type Cu2S on the other n-type semiconductors (ZnIn2S4 and TiO2) to construct p–n junctions, and the photocatalytic H2 production activity could still get promoted, demonstrating the universality of the p–n junction to improve the photocatalytic H2 activity [178]. There are other similar reports about the application of p–n junctions in the improvement of photocatalytic H2 production, such as Co3O4/CdS [179], Cu3P/CdS [180], Cu2O/TiO2 [181], and so on. Although the aforementioned heterojunction systems can improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, they all reduce the redox abilities of the photocatalysts, which is not good for the photocatalysis. Developing the efficient heterojunction systems with the efficient separation efficiency and maintained redox abilities of photogenerated carriers is really very important for photocatalytic water splitting. In recent years, Z-type heterojunction systems have been extensively studied, as shown in Fig. 22 a. Under light irradiation with enough energy, the photogenerated electrons in the CB of photocatalyst PS II can migrate and recombine with the photogenerated holes in the VB of photocatalyst PS I either directly or by bridging (electron transport medium or redox couple); thus the photogenerated electrons on the CB of PS I and the photogenerated holes on the VB of PS II can be effectively separated and maintain the corresponding redox ability to take part in the photocatalytic water splitting [177]. For examples, Zhang et al. [182]reported the application of the CdS/WO3 Z-type heterojunction in photocatalytic H2 production; the CdS/WO3 heterojunction exhibited five times higher H2 production activity than that of CdS alone under the same conditions due to the efficient charge transfer and separation. Xu et al. [183]successfully fabricated the 2D/2D Fe2O3/g-C3N4 direct Z-scheme photocatalyst via an electrostatic self-assembly method, and the Z-scheme charge transfer route can realize the spatial isolation of charge carriers and maintain the strong redox ability of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in Fe2O3/g-C3N4 system (Fig. 22b), which achieved about 13-fold photocatalytic H2 production activity than that of g-C3N4 alone and the good stability (Fig. 22c and d) [183]. Wang et al. [184] synthesized the ZnO/CdS hierarchical composite by a hydrothermal and chemical bath deposition process and further verified the direct Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism by the in situ XPS measurements and detection of the production of hydroxyl radicals, which exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalytic H2 production performance. Other reports about Z-scheme heterojunctions include WO3/g-C3N4 [185], CoTiO3/g-C3N4 [186], CdS/cobalt-benzimidazole coordination polymers [187], etc.; they all show the enhanced photocatalytic H2 production activity. The maintained strong redox ability of Z-scheme heterojunction makes it to be the most promising system for pure water splitting."
13,Cocatalyst modification in photocatalytic water splitting,"4.4 Cocatalyst modification in photocatalytic water splitting The cocatalyst plays an important role in photocatalytic water splitting for H2 production; a suitable cocatalyst-modified photocatalyst can realize the significantly enhanced and efficient photocatalytic H2 production. The main functions of the cocatalyst in photocatalytic water splitting are (1) providing the active sites for the redox reaction and reducing the kinetic energy barrier or activation energy of the reaction and (2) rapid transfer of photogenerated carriers to participate the photocatalytic reaction. Among them, the rapid transfer of photogenerated holes can effectively inhibit the photocorrosion of some photocatalysts such as metal sulfide and nitride semiconductors. Photocatalytic water splitting contains two important half reactions, which are H2 production and O2 production; therefore, the cocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 and O2 production have been extensively studied to improve the performance. Precious metals Pt and Pd are excellent cocatalysts in photocatalytic H2 production, but they are greatly limited because of their high cost and limited reserves. In recent years, many inexpensive and abundant cocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 production have been developed. For examples, Yu and Ran [188] synthesized the Cu(OH)2 nanoparticle–modified P25 (TiO2) photocatalysts, where Cu(OH)2 nanoparticles are the cocatalyst; the loading of Cu(OH)2 as the cocatalyst can greatly improve the photocatalytic H2 production of P25 because of the effective charge transfer, and the optimal photocatalytic H2 production activity was got when the loading amount reached to 0.29 mol%, which was 205 times higher than that of P25 without a cocatalyst [188]. There are other similar reports on the use of hydroxides as cocatalysts to enhance the photocatalytic H2 production performances, such as Ni(OH)2-modified CdS and g-C3N4, where Ni(OH)2 is the cocatalyst, and Co(OH)2-modified CdS, where Co(OH)2 is the cocatalyst [189–191]. Non-precious metal–based Ni as a cocatalyst has been reported for improving the photocatalytic H2 production activity; for example, Kong et al. [192] utilized the rapid light-assisted reduction method to obtain the Ni(0)-modified g-C3N4 composites. The Ni/g-C3N4 showed the superior photocatalytic H2 production activity because of the efficient electrons transfer and abundant active sites supplied by Ni(0) [192]. Some transition metal sulfides have also been reported as the cocatalysts for efficient photocatalytic H2 production; for example, Liu et al. [123] synthesized the noble metal–free NiS–modified MnxCd1-xS solid solution, where the noble metal–free NiS is the cocatalyst. Fig. 23 b showed the mechanism that photogenerated electrons could quickly transfer to the cocatalyst (NiS) active sites and participate in the photocatalytic H2 production reaction under light irradiation; the optimal sample exhibited 18.6 times higher H2 production activity than that of Mn0.5Cd0.5S without the cocatalyst and even better than that of the Pt-loaded Mn0.5Cd0.5S (Fig. 23a) [123]. There are other reports about transition metal sulfides as cocatalysts for the improvement of photocatalytic H2 production activity, such as WS2-modified CdS [193], NiS-modified CdS [194], NiS-modified g-C3N4 [195], CoSx-modified g-C3N4 [196], and CuxS-modified Mn0.5Cd0.5S [197], where WS2, NiS, CoSx, and CuxS are cocatalysts, respectively. Because of the superior electrocatalytic HER performances of transition metal phosphides and nitrides, many of them were introduced into photocatalytic H2 production systems as cocatalysts, which exhibited superior performances for improving the photocatalytic H2 production. For example, Ye et al. [198] reported the synthesis of Ni2P-modified g-C3N4, where Ni2P is the cocatalyst. Ni2P/g-C3N4 exhibited a superior photocatalytic H2 production activity (82.5 μmol/h/g), which was even higher than that of Pt-loaded g-C3N4 (72 μmol/h/g); the photo-excited electrons can rapidly transfer from g-C3N4 to Ni2P, which can realize the efficient separation of photo-excited carriers, and Ni2P as the active sites can be beneficial to the photocatalytic H2 production [198]. Similar cocatalysts are also widely used in photocatalytic H2 production, such as CoP/CdxZn1-xSe, Cu3P/g-C3N4, Ni3N/g-C3N4, CoxP/CdS, and NixP/g-C3N4 composites [199–203]. Reduced graphene oxide is regarded as a good electronic conductor because of its good electrical conductibility, and it has been widely used as a cocatalyst to transfer photogenerated electrons in photocatalytic H2 production activity [204–206]. Currently emerging two-dimensional materials such as ultrathin black phosphorus (BP) and Ti3C2Tx as cocatalysts also showed excellent activity in photocatalytic H2 production. For example, Ran et al. [207] synthesized the BP-modified ZnS, Zn0.8Cd0.2S, and CdS composites, which showed a high photocatalytic activity and apparent quantum yield for H2 production because of the high charge mobility, massive active sites, and favorable band structure of BP [207]. Ran et al. [208] reported the Ti3C2 MXene nanoparticle as a cocatalyst integrated with CdS achieved a super high visible-light photocatalytic H2 production activity of 14.342 mmol/h/g and an apparent quantum efficiency of 40.1% at 420 nm, which was attributed to the favorable Fermi level position (forming Schottky junction), electrical conductivity, and abundant H2 production active sites of Ti3C2 nanoparticles [208]. These cocatalysts are all good H2 production active sites, which are beneficial to the photocatalytic H2 production at the surface of photocatalysts, and the rapid reaction of photogenerated electrons can reduce the recombination of photogenerated carriers. In addition to designing the reduction cocatalysts for the efficient photogenerated electrons transfer, developing the oxidation cocatalysts for effective photogenerated holes transfer also can improve the photocatalytic H2 production activity. For examples, Di et al. [209] reported the synthesis of the cobalt-phosphate (Co-Pi)–modified CdS nanorod and its application in photocatalytic H2 production. As shown in Fig. 24 a, the photogenerated holes were effectively captured by the Co-Pi cocatalyst and then rapidly consumed by the sacrificial agent of lactic acid, which avoided the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. The photocatalytic H2 production result (Fig. 24b) showed that Co-Pi cocatalyst modification significantly increased the activity of CdS, and the optimal Co-Pi/CdS exhibited the H2 production activity of 13.3 mmol/h/g with an apparent quantum efficiency of 24.3% at 420 nm, which was even better than that of 1.0 wt% Pt/CdS (11.3 mmol/h/g). Ai et al. [210] synthesized the MnOx-decorated 3D porous C3N4 via a simple salt template–assisted method, and they found that loading of MnOx as hole-trapping sites could effectively promote separation of charge carriers, which further improved the photocatalytic H2 production activity of 3D porous C3N4 for about 3.5 times. Yuan et al. [179] synthesized the amorphous Co3O4-modified CdS nanorods by a one-step solvothermal reaction; the photogenerated holes in CdS could transfer to the Co3O4 cocatalyst and then get consumed by the sacrificial agent of Na2S and Na2SO3 solution under visible light because of the formation of the p–n junction, which could promote the separation of photogenerated carriers and improve the photocatalytic H2 production activity of CdS for about 33 times [179]. In addition to the improved H2 production activity, the loading of oxidation cocatalysts for effective transfer the photogenerated holes to participate in photocatalytic reaction can also avoid the self-oxidation of sulfide photocatalysts; thereby their stability can be improved. Recently, it has been found that the loading of spatially separated dual cocatalysts (both reduction and oxidation cocatalysts) on photocatalysts can further enhance the photocatalytic H2 production activity, and because of the synergistic effect of dual cocatalysts, it can show better photocatalytic activity than the loading of single cocatalyst [211]. For examples, Zhang et al. [212] synthesized the spatially separated Pt and CoOx cocatalysts on the internal and external of porous TiO2 nanotubes by atomic layer deposition; with Pt as the reductive active sites and CoOx as the oxidative active sites, the photogenerated carriers got efficient separation under the synergistic effect of dual cocatalysts, and the photocatalytic H2 production activity of the sample was far higher than that of CoOx or Pt-loaded TiO2 [212]. In a similar report, Meng et al. [213] utilized the crystal face heterojunction of TiO2 to realize the loading of spatially separated dual cocatalysts (Co3O4 as the oxidative active sites and Pt as the reductive active sites) to achieve the efficient photocatalytic H2 production. Liu et al. [214] used an ingenious method to synthesize the spatially separated dual cocatalysts (Cu2-xS and MoS2)–modified Mn0.5Cd0.5S photocatalysts, as shown in Fig. 25 ; the p–n heterojunction between Cu2-xS and Mn0.5Cd0.5S could accelerate the photogenerated holes transfer to the Cu2-xS and the photogenerated electrons could transfer to the MoS2 which is the active sites for H2 production. Because of the synergistic effect of dual cocatalysts, the photogenerated carriers can realize efficient separation, and the photocatalytic H2 production activity of Mn0.5Cd0.5S can get remarkable improvement than those of Cu2-xS alone– or MoS2 alone–modified Mn0.5Cd0.5S [214]."
14,The relationship between the electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting,"Electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting are two very promising hydrogen production methods, which can utilize and convert the nature energy (wind and water energy for electrocatalytic water splitting and solar energy for photocatalytic water splitting) to the clean, renewable, and high–energy density H2 energy. They all utilize electrons and holes to take part in the water splitting for the H2 and O2 production on the surface of the catalyst; the most different is the source of electrons and holes. The electrons and holes in electrocatalytic water splitting come from the supplied electrical energy, and the electrons and holes in photocatalytic water splitting are derived from the excited semiconductor by the solar light. Water splitting reaction derived by the electrons and holes takes place on the surface or the interface of the catalyst. therefore, the surface and interfacial properties of the catalyst play important roles for both electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting activity. Some surface and interfacial regulation strategies, such as morphology regulation, construction of heterojunction, cocatalyst modification, doping, and construction of surface defects, play active roles in improving the electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting performances. The most important point is that the development of advanced electrocatalysts is beneficial to the improvement of photocatalytic water splitting performance because the property and feature of advanced electrocatalyst are similar with the cocatalyst in photocatalysis, which plays an important role during the photocatalytic water splitting. Some advanced electrocatalysts can be used as superior cocatalysts in photocatalysis, which can provide more active sites, reduce the reaction energy barrier, and demonstrate good performance in promoting photocatalytic water splitting. Transition metal phosphides, the star materials in HER because of the superior electrical conductivity and Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption, have been widely used as cocatalysts in photocatalytic water splitting. For example, Shi et al. [215]reported that the CoP as the cocatalyst can dramatically improve the performance of photocatalytic pure water splitting of P-doped CdS, which can effectively promote the transfer of photogenerated electrons for H2 production. There are some similar reports such as Ni2P- and MoP-modified CdS [216,217]. Transition metal nitrides, another commonly used HER electrocatalysts, which have superior electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance, also can be used as cocatalysts in photocatalytic H2 production. For example, Chen et al. [201] reported the photocatalytic H2 production performance of the noble metal–free Ni3N-modified g-C3N4, with Ni3N as the cocatalyst, is even slightly higher than that of 3 wt% Pt-modified g-C3N4. NiFe-LDH is recognized as a superior OER material, which can also be used as the efficient cocatalyst in photocatalytic water oxidation. For example, Bai et al. [218]synthesized the NiFe-LDH nanosheets–modified Fe2O3/BiVO4 heterojunction, which could effectively hinder the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and improve the performance of photocatalytic water oxidation. Therefore, the development of advanced electrocatalysts has an important meaning for the photocatalytic water splitting."
15,Summary and outlook,"Hydrogen as a clean, pollution-free, and renewable energy can effectively solve the energy shortage and environmental pollution problems around the world. Photocatalytic and electrocatalytic water splitting for H2 production have been widely studied because of their many advantages, such as being pollution-free, easy product separation, and so on. In this review article, we first introduce the mechanism and performance evaluation parameters of electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting in detail; we point out that the main problems for electrocatalytic H2 production from water splitting are the overpotential and slow kinetics which can cause the waste of energy, and the main problem for photocatalytic H2 production from water splitting is the low conversion efficiency from solar energy to hydrogen energy. Then, we introduce the research process in electrocatalysts and photocatalysts, which are used for H2 production from water splitting. It is well known that almost all catalytic reactions are carried out on the surfaces and interfaces of the catalysts; therefore, the surface and interfacial conditions of the catalysts (component, structure, morphology, defect, active site, etc) will strongly affect their catalytic activities. Therefore, we summary the surface and interfacial regulation methods of the electrocatalysts and photocatalysts in detail, which contain morphology regulation, doping and construction of surface defects, construction of heterojunction, and cocatalyst modification. The implementation of these strategies can enhance the electrical conductivity, provide the favorable carrier transport path, obtain more active sites, change the surface and interfacial property for the favorable adsorption and desorption of reaction intermediates for electrocatalytic water splitting, expand the light absorption, support more active sites, and promote the efficient separation of photogenerated carriers for photocatalytic water splitting. These strategies are of great significance for realizing the efficient H2 production from water splitting. We hope that more efficient photocatalysts and electrocatalysts for water splitting can be explored, and more surface and interfacial regulation methods can be developed and applied to further improve the water splitting activity. During the photocatalytic water splitting, the cocatalysts for both H2 and O2 production are very similar to the electrocatalysts for HER and OER, respectively. Some metal sulfide, nitride and phosphide electrocatalysts have been widely used as cocatalysts in photocatalytic water splitting systems. Therefore, the development of electrocatalysts is very important for their application in photocatalytic water splitting fields. Exploring more efficient catalysts and developing more surface- and interface-modified strategies can improve the electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting activities, which can effectively reduce the energy loss during electrocatalytic water splitting and improve the conversion efficiency from solar energy to H2 energy. We hope that the photocatalytic and electrocatalytic water splitting can achieve large-scale practical application for H2 production and, ultimately, solve the energy crisis and environmental pollution problems."
