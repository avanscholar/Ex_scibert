0,Introduction,"Environment pollution and energy crisis are two major issues hindering the sustainable development of modern society [1,2]. Developing renewable energy technologies such as fuel cell, hydrogen evolution, photocatalysis, have been hailed as a promising avenue to reduce the dependence on fossil fuel, and facilitate environmental remediation and clean energy generation [3–8]. Particularly, the technologies with simultaneous energy recovery and waste treatment received special attentions. Due to the intriguing features including carbon-free, clean and high energy density, hydrogen were widely regarded as an ideal alternative to fossil fuel [9]. Microbial electrolysis cell (MECs), as a technology on the basis of microbial fuel cells (MFCs), can harvest electrons from the anode oxidation of organic matters by microbial community for hydrogen production on cathode with the external input of electrical energy, providing a novel pathway for hydrogen production and wastewater treatment [10–12]. However, the MEC is not feasible to degrade some persistent organics, such as azo dye due to their bio-refractory nature [13], and sensitive to ion concentration, pH and temperature. The stringent conditions for bacteria cultivation, complex microbial reaction mechanism and poor oxygen reduction kinetics hindered its practical applications [14–16]. Photocatalysis technology has a promising potential for solar energy utilization, attributing to the nature of solar energy, such as cost-free, clean and abundance. It has been reported that photoelectrochemical cells (PEC) provide a new avenue for hydrogen evolution and organic waste degradation, through photoelectrochemical reduction of H+ on cathode and the strong oxidation of organics on the anode, respectively [17–20]. However, the hydrogen production in PEC system usually needs external electric energy input, making this system inefficiency from the aspects of energy recovery. To mitigate the issue of requiring external energy input and combine the benefit of waste degradation, Wu et al. proposed a solar-driven dual photoelectrode photocatalytic fuel cell (PFC) based on n-type semiconductor photoanode and p-type semiconductor photocathode for hydrogen production and phenol degradation without the external energy input [21]. Uptonow, several solar-driven photocatalysis systems with composite semiconductor materials have been reported for hydrogen production [22–25]. However, continuous illumination is required to ensure the photocatalytic reaction throughout the reaction period, since the photocatalytic hydrogen production and organic removal are closely rely on solar irradiation. Therefore, the hydrogen production is hardly maintained in the absence of solar radiation at night. The combination of photoelectrodes with capacitors is a promising way to solve the above-mentioned issues. The excited photogenerated electrons under the light irradiation can be stored in capacitor and then discharged for hydrogen production under dark. This design can effectively alleviate the recombinationofthephotogeneratedelectrons and holes, and expand the application of solar energy conversion and storage. Supercapacitor (SC) with the features of fast charging/discharging, long cycling ability andlow cost can store energy through ion adsorption or redox reaction, exhibiting a potential for electron collection and storage under solar irradiation and discharging under dark in PFC. For example, Zhou et al. reported a dual-photoelectrodes solar-charged PFC using WO3 nanofibers as photoelectrode with electron storage capacity and C/Cu2O nanowire arrays as photocathode. The photogenerated electrons were stored in the framework of WO3 nanofibers and then continuously discharged for hydrogen production. The results showed that the PFC system had a hydrogen production of 93.08 μmol/cm2 and a total organic carbon removal rate of 82.12% under visible light for 8 h, and a hydrogen production of 7.50 μmol/cm2 under dark for 4 h [13]. In spite of efficient photocatalysis and supercapacitance performance, the catalysts such as WO3 showed a low stability in alkaline environments. In addition, the photocatalysts including CdS, WO3 and Cu2O suffered from photocorrosion in the water. Porous carbon can be a promising alternative for the preparation of SC due to its high surface area, tunable pore size, good electrical conductivity and excellent chemical stability. In principle, the energy storage mechanism of carbon-based SC can be divided into double layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance [26]. It was reported that the accessible surface area and pore structure can improve the double layer capacitance, while the introduction of heteroatom can alter the electronic structure of carbon and enhance the pseudocapacitance [27]. Interestingly, carbon derived from biomass (such as from plants, animals, and sewage sludge) generally has abundant pore structure, surface area and inherent heteroatom doping [28,29]. Among different biocarbons, natural bamboo charcoal stands out as one of the most commonly used precursors for electrodes in electrochemical energy conversion and storage. For example, Yang et al. synthesized oxygen reduction reaction catalyst using bamboo brunches, and found that the as-prepared bamboo charcoal catalyst delivered a comparable performance to Pt/C in MFCs, due to its hierarchical pore structure, high specific surface area, inherent nitrogen and phosphorus doping [30]. These features also satisfy the requirement of the SC preparation. Indeed, Deng et al. reported a carbonaceous SC synthesized from bamboo charcoal material, and the as-prepared SC exhibited a specific capacitance of 61 F/g at a low current density of 0.1 A/g [31]. Similarly, Gong et al. used potassium ferrate to fulfil the synchronous carbonization and graphitization of bamboo charcoal, the as-prepared SC delivered a high specific capacitance of 222.0 F/g at 0.5 A/g in 6 M KOH [32]. These results confirmed the feasibility of bamboo charcoal for SC application. However, the fabrication of carbon SCs device in PFC system was rarely reported. On the basis of these considerations, the aim of this work is to develop a green supercapacitor assisted photocatalytic fuel cell (SC-PFC) system for continuous hydrogen production. The system composed of a TiO2 photoanodeand pyrrole deposited Ni foam cathode (Ni-PPy) for simultaneous organic compounds degradation and hydrogen production using bamboo derived activated carbon as SC for electron storage (Fig. 1 ). The SC in this system can storage electrons under light irradiation and discharge for hydrogen production under dark, consequently achieving an uninterrupted hydrogen production. Furthermore, a porous Ni-PPy cathode and chemical bias was proposed in the system to overcome the overpotential of hydrogen evolution and ensure the hydrogen production on cathode. This work provides a feasible approach for simultaneous wastewater treatment and energy recovery by using a SC-PFC system."

Acetone, ethyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, NH4F, HCl, Na2SO4, NaOH, SO4, and (NH4)3PO4 were from Tianjin Fengchuan Chemical reagent Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China). Nafion (5 wt%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Pyrrole monomer was purchased from Macklin. In addition, the titanium plates were purchased from Qingyuan Metal Production Co., Ltd. (Hebei, China). Bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens Mazel) was collected from campus. And nickel foam with 1.7 mm in thickness was purchased from Taiyuan Lanke Battery Sales Department (ShanXi, China)."
3,Preparation of anode and cathode,"2.2 Preparation of anode and cathode TiO2 nanotubes were synthesized as photoanode according to our previously work [2]. In detail, the photoanode was prepared through a two-step oxidation process. A Ti plate with a diameter of 80 mm (corresponding to the surface area of ~50.27 cm2) was polished using sandpapers (360 mesh and 180 mesh, respectively). After that, the Ti plate was ultrasonically washed with acetone, ethanol, and nanopure water (18 MΩ) for 15 min for further processing. Then, the prepared Ti plates were oxidized in electrolyte (ethylene glycol, 3 v.% deionized water and 0.3 wt% NH4F) with a two-electrode configuration, in which the prepared Ti plate was used as working electrode and a Pt plate (1 cm × 1 cm) as counter electrode. To ensure a uniform formation of TiO2 nanotubes, two electrodes were kept at a spacing of 2.5 cm in parallel during the oxidation process. The two-step oxidation process was performed as follows: the Ti plate was first oxidized at 55 V for 1 h and then sonicated in methanol for 10 s. After that, the obtained Ti plate was oxidized at 55 V for 3 h using the same solution again. Finally, the prepared Ti plate was annealed at 450 °C in a muffle for 1 h at a heating rate of 2.5 °C/min. The Ni-PPy cathode was prepared by depositing pyrrole monomer on nickel foam using electrodeposition method. The nickel foam was first cut into a semicircle with a diameter of 80 mm, and ultrasonically washed in acetone, 1 M HCl and nanopure water (18 MΩ) for 15 min, respectively, and then dried in air. Subsequently, the nickel foam was placed in an electrolyte composed of 100 mL of 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 3 mL of pyrrole monomer for electrodeposition with a three-electrode configuration, in which the nickel foam served as working electrode, a Pt plate (1 cm × 1 cm) as counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode (saturated KCl) as reference electrode. Finally, the obtained Ni-PPy was cleaned using nanopore water and then dried in air. The electrodeposition was performed at a constant potential (0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl) for 20 min based on a potentiostat (CHI660E, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., Ltd., China). During the electrodeposition, N2 gas (≥99.999% purity, the same below) was continuously sparged into the electrolyte to remove the dissolved oxygen."
4,Preparation of bamboo charcoal supercapacitor,"2.3 Preparation of bamboo charcoal supercapacitor The bamboo charcoal was prepared as previously described [30]. Briefly, the bamboo branches were washed with nanopure water and dried at 100 °C overnight. Then, the dried bamboo brunches were used as precursors and pyrolyzed at 900 °C for 2 h in a tube furnace (GSL-1200X, Hefei Kejing Materials Technology CO., China) in a N2 atmosphere. The resulting products were then ground into a fine bamboo charcoal powder. The SC was fabricated by loading bamboo charcoal powder on a Ti plate (80 mm in diameter) using wet spraying method. In detail, the obtained bamboo charcoal powder and 5 wt% Nafion emulsions with a mass ratio of 4:1 were added into ethyl alcohol. After that, the mixture was stirred and sonicated for 30 min, respectively. The stirring and sonication procedures were repeated 3 times to obtain well dispersed particles. Finally, the obtained mixture was sprayed on the surface of the Ti plate and then dried at 90 °C. The as-prepared SC was donated as bamboo charcoal/Ti with a bamboo charcoal loading rate of 2 mg/cm2."
5,Structure of the system,"2.4 Structure of the system The SC-PFC system for organic matter degradation and hydrogen production was fabricated and operated in an acrylic reactor, as shown in Fig. 1a. The Ni-PPy and homemade TiO2 nanotubes disk were used as cathode and photoanode, respectively. The as-fabricated SCs served as electronic storage devices, which was coaxially connected to the photoanode. The cathode and anode were separated by using a cation exchange membrane to maintain the chemical bias. A 300 W xenon lamp (PLS-SXE-300, Beijing Perfect light Co, china) with 368 nm was employed as light source (the light irradiance of 3.6 mW/cm2). Ultraviolet light can pass through the quartz glass to the surface of photoanode during the measurements. Anolyte was 100 mL of 1 M NaOH and 2 v.% glycol, and catholyte was 70 mL of 0.5 M H2SO4. The photoanode and cathode were connected by an external circuit. Fig. 1b depicts the mechanism of organic matter degradation and hydrogen production in the SC-PFC system. Under the light irradiation, part of photogeneratedelectrons is transferred to cathode and remaining part is stored in SCs, whereas photogenerated holes can produce plenty of radicals for ethylene glycol degradation. In cathode, the electrons from anode or SCs can be used for hydrogen evolution under both light and dark. The N2 at a flow rate of 150 mL/min was continuously injected into the electrolyte until the experiments were finished. The current and potential changes in the system were collected through a data acquisition instrument (Agilent 34972A, The Netherlands)."
6,Photoelectrochemistry/electrochemistry,"2.5 Photoelectrochemistry/electrochemistry The photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared electrodes was characterized on an electrochemical station (CHI 660E, Shanghai Chenhua Instruments, China). Specifically, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) measurements of bamboo charcoal/Ti were accomplished to evaluate the performance of supercapacitor in 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH 1, adjusted by using H2SO4) with a standard three-electrode configuration, where the as-prepared bamboo charcoal/Ti electrode was employed as the working electrode, and Ag/AgCl and Pt plate (1 cm × 1 cm) were used as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurement of the Ni-PPy cathode was performed at a scanning speed 5 mV/s from −0.2 to −1.0 V in 0.5 M H2SO4. The voltage-current curve of the system was measured by LSV at a scan rate of 20 mV/s with two-electrode configuration, in which the cathode served as the counter and reference electrodes, the anode was used as working electrode, as previously described [13]. The power density and current density were obtained by normalizing the power and current to the surface area of electrode (ca. 50.27 cm2)."
7,Data calculation and analyses,"2.6 Data calculation and analyses Morphologies of samples were acquired by using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7001F, Japan). Elemental mapping analysis was conducted using an Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS, Oxford instrument, UK) detector attached to the JSM-7001F microscope. The element components and valence state on the surface of bamboo charcoal were obtained on a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer with a 150 W monochromatic Al K source. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) of pollution was analyzed based on the standard method [33]. In detail, the mixture containing 2.5 mL of contaminants, 0.7 mL of LH-D reagent and 4.8 mL of LH-E reagent was heated for 10 min at 165 °C. The mixture was then cooled down to room temperature using water bath, and the value of COD was analyzed based on a COD detector (5B-3C V8, Lian Hua Technology, China). Hydrogen production on the cathode was detected by a gas chromatograph (GC 7900, Techcomp, Shanghai, China) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). N2 was used as the carrier gas, a hydrogen generator ACTS (SPH-300, Beijing BCHP Analytical Technology Institute, Beijing, China) as hydrogen source, and an automatic air source device (SPB-3, Beijing BCHP Analytical Technology Institute, Beijing, China) as air source."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization 3.1.1 Photoanode and cathode Morphologies of TiO2 nanotube anode and cathode were acquired by using SEM. Fig. 2 a and b show the top view and cross-section images of photoanode. It can be found that TiO2 nanotubes were regularly arranged on the surface of Ti plate with 60–80 nm in diameter during anodic oxidation process. Fig. 2b showed the tubular nanostructure on the cross-section of TiO2 nanotube anode. These hollow microstructure and the long nanotube arrays might facilitate the electrolyte penetration and the utilization of light on the surface of anode. As shown in Fig. 2c, the structure of Ni foam was illustrated. It can be found that the Ni foam possessed a porous three-dimensional skeleton structure with a pore size >100 μm. This structure can facilitate the mass transport of ion and hydrogen gas. After the electrodeposition, a layer of PPy was closely attached onto the surface of skeleton. One can see from Fig. 2d that the PPy on Ni foam exhibited a rough surface, which might extend the high specific area of cathode and thus offer more electrochemical active sites for cathode reaction. Consequently, the improved active sites probably promote the reduction of H+ by photogenerated electrons from the external circuit and improve the separation of electron-hole pairs on the photoanode. In addition, Ni foam as an ideal electrode material for catalyzing hydrogen evolution can also facilitate the electron transfer and the hydrogen production during the operation [34]. 3.1.2 Supercapacitor Morphologies of bamboo charcoal are shown in Fig. 3 a and b, it is clear that the bamboo charcoal exhibited an interconnected microstructure with interstitial porosity, which was made of irregular carbon particles with small sizes of ~1 μm. In order to examine the element distribution on the surface of bamboo charcoal, the elemental mapping images were obtained based on an EDS detector. From Fig. 3c–e, one can see that the elements of N and P were distributed homogeneously within the bamboo charcoal, indicating the inherent P and N incorporation in the natural bamboo charcoal materials. To gain a deeper understanding of the physical structure of bamboo charcoal, the specific surface area of bamboo charcoal was estimated based on the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. 3f). It can be found that bamboo charcoal exhibited a type IV isotherm shape with capillary condensation in the range of 0.3–0.4 P/P0 due to the presence of mesopores in the form of aggregates of particles, and a sharp upturn H4 hysteresis loop locating at the high relative pressure region, as commonly found in micro/mesoporous carbons [35]. Based on multi-point BET method, the specific surface area of bamboo charcoal can be estimated as 583.37 m2/g, which was higher than literature reported [36]. The pore distribution of bamboo charcoal was plotted and shown in Fig. 3g, it can be seen that two obvious peaks can be identified at ~10 nm and 40 nm with a pore volume of 0.22 cm3/g, suggesting that the pore distribution of bamboo charcoal was dominated by mesopores. The relatively high specific surface area and dominated mesoporous structure can increase the accessible electroactive surface area and pores for ion transfer, and consequently improve the electrochemical performance. The element component and valence state on the surface of bamboo charcoal was also evaluated by using XPS. From the XPS survey spectrum in Fig. 4 a, the P 2p, C 1s, N 1s and O 1s electrons can be found at ~133, ~284, ~400, ~533 eV, respectively. These results showed that P, N and O were indeed existed the carbon matrix of bamboo charcoal, at the concentrations of 0.49 at.% for P, 0.43 at.% for N and 10.08 at.% for O. To further identify the detailed chemical configuration of these elements, the high-resolution spectra of C 1s, O 1s, N 1s and P 2p were recorded and shown in Fig. 4b–e. It can be found that high-resolution C 1s mainly exhibits three peaks at ~284.04, 284.64 and 286.89 eV, which can be assigned to CC/C–C, CN/C–P and C–O, respectively (Fig. 4b). As shown in Fig. 4c, deconvolution of the O 1s spectra yielded three subpeaks, CO at 530.40 eV, C–OH/ C–O–C at 531.59 eV and chemisorbed oxygen (COOH) at 533.11 eV. The oxygen related functional group including C–O, CO and COOH can enhance the hydrophilicity of electrode materials, and hence increase the contact surface area of electrolyte and enhance the mass transport of ions [37–39]. The N1s spectra (Fig. 4d) composed of three peaks at ~398.16, ~400.10 and ~401.00 eV, which are corresponded to pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N and graphitic-N, respectively. Additionally, three subpeaks was observed in the high-resolution of P 2p, 132.68 eV for P-C, 133.36 eV for P-N and 134.13 eV for C-O-PO3. It has been reported that N- and P-doping can increase electrochemical active sites, improve the wettability of electrolyte on the surface of electrode, and therefore improve the electrochemical activity of materials [40,41]."
10,Performance of supercapacitor,"3.2 Performance of supercapacitor The electrochemical tests of the as-prepared bamboo charcoal/Ti were performed with a three-electrode configuration. The electrochemical performance and charge storage capacity of supercapacitors were first evaluated using GCD measurements at different current densities within −1.0–0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). As shown in Fig. 5 a, one can see that the GCD time decreases with the increase of current density. Notably, the nonlinear potential-time curves suggested that the capacitance was not only dominated by double layer capacitance resulting from the pure electrostatic attraction between ions and the charged electrode surface, but also the pseudocapacitance arising from the rapid reversible redox or faradaic charge transfer reaction [26]. The specific capacitance of bamboo charcoal/Ti from GCD measurements was calculated using the following equation [42]: C sp = I × Δ t Δ V × m where I is the discharge current (A), Δ t the discharge time (s), Δ V the potential window (V), and m the mass (g) of bamboo charcoal/Ti. Fig. 5b depicts the influence of current on the specific capacitance of bamboo charcoal/Ti. One can see that the specific capacitance was declined with increasing current density. The specific capacitance was calculated as 268 F/g at 0.05 A. The decreased specific capacitance at high current densities can be due to the insufficient mass transport of ions in the inner pores of bamboo charcoal/Ti electrode. In addition, cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were conducted at different scan rates, as depicted in Fig. 5c. It can be found that the shape of the CV curves keeps almost same even at a higher scan rate, suggesting that the bamboo charcoal/Ti had a high electrochemical stability. During the charge storage process, the ions reversibly adsorb and desorb at the interfaces of electrolyte and carbon materials. Specific capacitance of bamboo charcoal/Ti was calculated from CV measurements using the following equation [42]: C sp = Q Δ V × ( ∂ v ∂ t ) × m where Q is the area under the CV curve, ∂ v/∂ t the scan rate, ΔV the potential window and m the mass of bamboo charcoal/Ti. Fig. 5d illustrated varies of specific capacitance at different scan rates. During the CV process, the electrolyte ions reversibly adsorb and desorb at the surface of the porous carbon, and the rapid reversible redox or faradaic charge transfer reaction occurred on the active sites [43]. It can be seen that the specific capacitance decreased with increasing scan rate. This might be attributed to the insufficient adsorption-desorption or redox reaction of ions on the electrode surface at a higher scan rate [44]. It was reported that the accessible surface area and pore structure can improve the ion accessibility of the electrode, and consequently enhance the double layer capacitance. The introduction of heteroatom (N, P, O, etc.) can alter the electronic structure of carbon, and enhance improve the pseudocapacitance [27,45–47]. The improvement of accessible electroactive surface area and active sites can effectively improve performance of SCs [26,27]. Notably, the bamboo charcoal/Ti exhibited a capacitive performance comparable to or even higher than that derived from natural bamboo leaves [36]. In addition, it can be also found that the retained capacitive performance of bamboo charcoal/Ti at high current densities was larger than 75% of the initial capacitive performance at low current densities and scan rates, exhibiting a similar or even better stability than those synthesized from bamboo precursors [43,48]. These results indicated that the as-prepared bamboo charcoal/Ti electrode exhibited a considerable capacitive performance and stability for charge storage."
11,Cathode reduction for hydrogen production,"3.3 Cathode reduction for hydrogen production To investigate the performance of hydrogen production, the SC-PFC system was tested under different conditions (Fig. 6 a). It can be found that the hydrogen production tended to increase gradually with the prolongation of illumination time. In the initial absence of light, the hydrogen production was nearly zero, and then continually increased in the first 4 h under the AM 1.5 illumination under closed circuit. The amount of the hydrogen production was calculated as 33 μmol/L. Notably, the hydrogen production underwent a slow increase in the first 1 h and then sharply increased, this differentiated from the linear increase in the previous studies [13,49]. Indeed, the variation of hydrogen production can be reflected by the photo-current (Fig. S1), which increased slowly at the beginning 1 h and then underwent an accelerated increase, probably due to the electron storage of bamboo charcoal/Ti occurred in the first 1 h. After keeping in the dark for 4 h (from 4 to 8 h), the hydrogen generation was found to be almost zero. It seems that the hydrogen generation using electrons stored in SC was failed in the system. This is also reflected by the current-time curve, in which no obvious discharge current was observed (Fig. S1). To reveal the reasons for the failure of hydrogen production, the attentions were turned to the cathode potential. The electrochemical performance of the Ni-PPy cathode was evaluated by using LSV. A shown in Fig. 6c, one can see that the onset potential of hydrogen evolution on the cathode was around −0.35 V vs. Ag/AgCl, and the cathode displayed a negligible current generation at a potential high than −0.35 V. However, it can be found that the cathode potential in the SCs-PFC system was about −0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl during the discharging when keeping in the dark (Fig. 6b), significantly higher than onset potential of hydrogen evolution (−0.35 V vs. Ag/AgCl). These results concluded that the cathode potential was probably the critical factor affecting the hydrogen production, the inefficient hydrogen production might be attributed to the higher cathode potential, compared to the onset potential of hydrogen evolution. To verify this viewpoint, the cathode potential was lowered when the PFC system was kept under light for another 4 h under open circuit condition (from 8 to 12 h). Apparently, the cathode potential continuously decreased from an initial value of −0.34 to about −0.74 V (Fig. 6b). One can see that the cathode potential from 8 to 12 h was much lower than that from 1 to 4 h. When changing from open circuit to closed circuit, a rapid discharging was observed with a sharp decline of current from 8 to 12 h, probably resulting from a lower potential which provides a higher overpotential than that from 1 to 4 h. As a result, obvious hydrogen production was observed from 12 to 16 h when the PFC system was kept in dark with the connection of anode and cathode. During the discharging in dark, the bamboo charcoal/Ti was used as the electron donor once the anode and cathode were connected, this can also be confirmed by cyclic voltammetry of bamboo charcoal/Ti. As shown in Fig. 6d, it is seen that the current response of bamboo charcoal/Ti SC was significantly increased after charging, indicating that the PFC system used the electrons stored in the bamboo charcoal/Ti for hydrogen production as long as the cathode potential was lower than onset potential of hydrogen evolution. With the prolongation of discharging from 12 to 16 h, the amount of hydrogen production reached up to 13 μmol/L, which was about one-third of the value obtained from 1 to 4 h. Therefore, these results showed that the as-developed SC-PFC system provided a feasible avenue for hydrogen production in dark by using SCs as electron reservoirs. Based on the constraint conditions of hydrogen evolution (lower than thermodynamic potential), the cathode potential from 4 to 8 h might be lowered in the system from several aspect in the further, such as developing high efficiency anode catalyst, developing high performance SCs."
12,Anode oxidation for ethylene glycol degradation,"3.4 Anode oxidation for ethylene glycol degradation The degradation of organic matter was also evaluated in the system. It can be seen from Fig. 7 a that the system had a COD removal rate of 48% at the first 24 h underlight irradiationcondition, exhibiting a viable degradation capacity for ethylene glycol. A possible explanation was that the SC can store the photogenerated electrons under the illumination, thus the recombination of photogeneratedelectrons and holes was inhibited and plenty of radicals were formed by holes oxidization, eventually enhancing the decomposition of ethylene glycol. After illumination, the system was kept in dark with the disconnection of anode and cathode for 9 h (from 24 to 33 h), it is seen that the system exhibited a negligible change of COD removal. Even with the connection of anode and cathode (from 33 to 42 h), the COD removal rate still remain almost the same as that at the end of the first 24 h. This was due to the reason that the holes cannot be produced on the anode in the absence of light, the lack of oxide species on the anode lead to the inhibition of the degradation of ethylene glycol. Current density of the system was continuously recorded under alternate light and dark conditions, as shown in Fig. 7b. It can be seen that the photocurrent was instantly raised to 0.23 mA cm−2 when applying illumination. Once the light was turned off, the photocurrent density immediately declined to about 0.18 mA cm−2, and then further slowly decreased. This phenomenon can be attributed to the SCs connected to the photoanode, which lead to a prolonged discharge time. At the same time, the potential of photoanode was also measured. It is clear that the anode exhibited a similar potential change to that of current response. Notably, the anode potential is below −0.35 V (onset potential for hydrogen evolution) under the illumination, further confirming the capacity of hydrogen production without external energy input. The power generation of the system was further evaluated, as shown in Fig. 7c. One can see that the as-developed system delivered a maximum power density of 0.12 mW/cm2 using ethylene glycol as substrate, suggesting that the system was capable of generating electricity, degrading organic pollution, and producing hydrogen simultaneously. From above experimental data, it can be found that the hydrogen production was 32 μmol/L (8.96 × 10-2 μmol/cm2) under illumination and 13 μmol/L (3.64 × 10-2 μmol/cm2) under dark, the removal rate of ethylene glycol was 48% within 24 h, and the power density was 0.12 mW/cm2. The SC-PFC system had a much lower hydrogen production and removal rate, but exhibited a significant higher power output, compared to the similar work reported by Zhou et al. (hydrogen production: 93.08 μmol/cm2 under illumination and 7.5 μmol/cm2 under dark, phenol removal rate: 82.12%) [13]. However, it should be noticed that the factors including materials, reactor size and substrate etc. are different, a direct comparison may not be reasonable. Considering the capacity of electron storage of SC, the anode integrated with SCs can facilitate the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, thus enhance the efficiency of the photoelectrocatalysis conversion and increase the total energy gain. Therefore, based on the experimental data, the calculated light-to-fuel energy conversion efficiency increased by 50% (from 0.022% to 0.033%) after the integration of supercapacitors in a full light-dark cycle, this efficiency is much higher than 0.008% of the NaYF4-Yb3+-Er3+/CdS photocatalyst under NIR light irradiation [50]. This suggested that the SC-PFC design indeed increased the energy advantage or benefits of the system, compared to traditional PFC."
13,Repeatability analysis,"3.5 Repeatability analysis The stability of the system and the reproducibility of data were verified by cycling tests. As shown in Fig. 8 a, the COD concentration gradually decreased over time, and the degradation curve was triplicated with a degradation time of ~24 h. At the same time, the current density of the system was also recorded, as depicted in Fig. 8b. It can be found that both degradation and current density curves were highly similar during three cycles, showing that the as-developed system had a good stability and reusability of ethylene glycol degradation and electricity generation."
14,Conclusions,"In this paper, we proposed a SC-PFC system for wastewater treatment, electricity generation and uninterrupted hydrogen production. In this system, the SCs can store the photoelectrons under the illumination and then release electrons for hydrogen production under dark conditions. The electrochemical tests revealed thebehaviors of the bamboo charcoal/Ti and its satisfactory performance. The as-developed system exhibited a capacity of ethylene glycol degradation, electricity generation and hydrogen production without external energy input. In addition, cycling tests confirmed the stability and reliability of the system. These results showed that the as-developed SC-PFC system provided a new insight for energy recovery and waste treatment."
