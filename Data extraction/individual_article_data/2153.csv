0,Introduction,"Biological hydrogen production from organic substrates using phototrophic microorganisms, in relation to wastewater treatment is a promising approach for bioenergy generation [1,2]. Photoheterotrophic hydrogen production involves endogenous catabolism of organic compounds as a source of reducing power [3]. Bacterial and cyanobacterial species have been studied for photoheterotrophic hydrogen production [4]. Photoheterotrophic hydrogen production using microalgae is attracting great interest because of its potential ability to degrade organic pollutants, which serve as carbon and energy sources during hydrogen production [5,6]. Microalgal hydrogen production using organic compounds such as acetate, starch and glucose has been reported [7], but application of such substrates for commercial hydrogen production might not be economically feasible [8]. Different wastewaters streams such as municipal wastewater, piggery wastewater and agricultural runoff have been utilized for microalgal cultivation [9], but their use for microalgal hydrogen production has not been thoroughly investigated. Optimization of microalgal photoheterotrophic hydrogen production by replacing synthetic organic substrates with real wastewater effluents would contribute significantly to bioenergy research. The effluent of dark-fermentation is rich in short chain VFAs (volatile fatty acids) such as acetate and butyrate, which can serve as alternative substrates for microalgae photoheterotrophic cultivation and subsequently the hydrogen production [10]. Oxygen evolved during microalgae cultivation due to photosynthetic activity inhibits the oxygen sensitive hydrogenase and hydrogen production [11]. Most research related to phototrophic hydrogen production has therefore been performed under anaerobic conditions [12], but the effect of evolved oxygen on hydrogenase with respect to its activity and hydrogen evolution should be examined when new microalgal strains are being investigated [13]. We investigated heterotrophic hydrogen production by the microalga M. reisseri YSW05 using acetate- and butyrate-rich effluents derived from conventional microbial fermentation to mimic wastewater from municipal wastewater treatment facilities. Parameters such as the effluent dilution, pH and light/dark cycle were optimized to achieve higher biomass production, consumption of acetate and butyrate, and hydrogen production. The influence of oxygen evolved during microalgal photoheterotrophic cultivation on hydrogenase activity was simultaneously evaluated with apparent hydrogen production."
1,Material and methods,
2,Seed sludge for fermentation and isolation/identification of microalga,"2.1 Seed sludge for fermentation and isolation/identification of microalga Seed sludge used in this study was collected from the anaerobic digesters of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (Wonju, Water Supply and Drainage Center, South Korea). The inoculum was acclimatized to glucose for 1 month in an anaerobic continuous culture at 35 °C with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 12 h [14]. We used glucose as the substrate with a concentration of 14,063 mg/L (15,000 mg COD/L). Microalga was isolated from the effluent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (Wonju Water Supply and Drainage Center, South Korea) [15] and cultured in 50% bold basal medium (BBM) (1:1 v/v BBM and filter sterilized wastewater effluent). Ten milliliters of microalgal suspended culture (OD 680 nm = 1.4 and volatile suspended solids; VSS = 1.9 g/L) was inoculated into 100 mL of autoclaved BBM medium in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask [15]. The flask was incubated on a rotary shaker (SH-804, Seyoung Scientific) at 27 °C and 150 rpm under continuous illumination using white fluorescent light with an intensity of 40 μ/m/s for 3 weeks. Morphology of the microalga was observed under a light microscope (Supplementary Fig. 1a). PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification of genomic DNA isolated from the microalga was conducted using universal forward and reverse primers. A single amplified LSU rDNA (large subunit ribosomal DNA) (D1–D2) band with a size of ∼850-bp was recorded for isolate. The LSU-rRNA gene has a higher evolutionary rate than SSU-rRNA (small subunit ribosomal RNA) gene and should offer a better tool for the discrimination of closely related species using short diagnostic sequences. Based on the LSU rDNA (D1–D2) sequence, we concluded that the microalgal isolate YSW05 was closely related to M. reisseri HF536547 with 97% sequence similarity. The DNA sequence was deposited in the NCBI database with the accession number FR751195. A phylogenetic tree based on the LSU-rDNA D1–D2 sequence was constructed using MEGA 4.0 to determine the phylogenetic associations of the isolated strain of microalga with similar sequences in Genbank (Supplementary Fig. 1b). This analysis revealed that YSW05 grouped together with M. reisseri JN169781 in a clade with high bootstrap support; these two sequences showed 93% sequence similarity."
3,Experimental batch setup for the combined system,"2.2 Experimental batch setup for the combined system A schematic diagram of the combined apparatus is shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. Fermentative bacterial hydrogen production was carried out using synthetic wastewater in the dark-fermentation hydrogen production (1st stage), followed by photo-heterotrophic microalgal hydrogen production (2nd stage) using the effluent from the dark-fermentation reactor. The fermentation effluent was autoclaved, and filtered with 0.2 μm GF/C (Glass fiber filter, Type C) filter before loading into the photo-heterotrophic reactor. Thus, the transfer of fermentative bacteria from the 1st stage to the 2nd stage was eliminated. The average residual glucose fraction in the dark-fermentation effluent was estimated using phenol-H2SO4 methods [16]. Synthetic wastewater added to the 1st stage contained the following nutrients (in mM): glucose, 44.5; NH4HCO3, 59.5; K2HPO4, 0.72; MgCl2 6H2O, 0.49; MnSO4 6H2O, 0.06; FeSO4 7H2O, 0.09; CuSO4 5H2O, 0.02; CoCl2 5H2O, 0.00045; and NaHCO3, 23.8. The fermentative hydrogen production experiment was carried out in triplicate using 120 mL serum bottles with a working volume of 80 mL at HRT 6 h and pH 5.5, and the fermentation effluent (40 mL) discharged from the dark-fermentative bacterial hydrogen production was collected in a stabilization tank where parameters such as the dilution ratio (dark-fermentation effluent: deionized water) and pH of the effluent were adjusted before loading the effluent into the photo-heterotrophic microalgae reactor using a graduated syringe. The headspace of each bottle was flushed with N2 (99.99 v/v) gas and sealed tightly with a butyl rubber stopper and an aluminum crimp. Solution pH, COD (chemical oxygen demand) and VFAs content of the fermentation effluent were 4.9, 160 and 2430 mg/L, respectively. Photo-heterotrophic microalgal hydrogen production was conducted at 25 °C in 120 mL serum bottles under white fluorescent light illumination (6.4 W/m2). Each batch experiment was conducted in triplicate. The effects of initial pH (4.9–9.0), effluent dilution (1:0–1:2) and light/dark cycle on hydrogen production from the organic carbon rich fermentation effluent were investigated for 5 days of incubation period. The effluent had abundant acetate (1500–1650 mg/L) and butyrate (840–880 mg/L). Light conversion efficiency was calculated using the following equation (1) [17]. (1) η = [ 33.61 · ρ H 2 · V H 2 ( I · A · t ) ] × 100 where, V H2 is the produced H2 volume in L, ρH2 is the density of produced hydrogen gas in g/L, I represents the light intensity in W/m2, A is the irradiated area in m2, and t is the duration of hydrogen production in h. The definition of HY (hydrogen yield) is indicated in equation (2) [18]. (2) HY = Amount of H 2 produced / amount of carbon substrate consumed Theoretical H 2 produced / amount of carbon substrate consumed × 100 The theoretical amount of H2 produced was calculated based on the stoichiometric conversion of acetate and butyrate to H2 (equations (3) and (4)). (3) CH3CH2CH2COOH + 2H2O → 2 CH3COOH + 2H2 (4) CH3COOH + 2H2O → 4H2 + 2CO2"
4,Hydrogenase activity analysis,"2.3 Hydrogenase activity analysis Microalgae cultivated at different initial pH for 0–5 days were harvested by centrifugation (3000 g, 4 °C, 15 min) and washed twice with 20 mM phosphate buffered (pH 7.5) 1% NaCl solution. The resulting pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of the same buffer, and the cell suspension was flushed with oxygen-free nitrogen gas for 15 min under anaerobic conditions. Hydrogenase activity was quantified by the amount of hydrogen evolved from 1 mL of methyl viologen assay buffer consisting of 20 mL 1 M Tris at pH 8 and 300 mg MV (methyl viologen) that was reduced by sodium dithionite [19]. Hydrogen formation was determined by gas chromatography (GC6890A, Agilent, US). Assays were performed in seal-lock vials (20 mL) with equal volumes of liquid and gas phase. The sample was injected into 10 mL of basal buffer containing 5 mM MV and 5 mM sodium dithionite and incubated in a shaker at 28 °C for 30 min. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of hydrogenase evolving 1 μmol hydrogen gas per minute. Protein concentration in crude extracts was determined by the Bradford method [20] using bovine serum albumin."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Solution pH was measured with a pH meter (Thermo Orion 290A, Orion Corporation), VSS was analyzed by standard methods [21]. Hydrogen gas production was calculated by headspace measurements of gas composition and the total volume of biogas produced at each time interval using Eq. (5): (5) V H,i = V H,i−1 + C H,i (V G,i −V G,i−1) + VH(C H,i −C H,i−1) where V H,i and V H,i−1 are the cumulative hydrogen gas volumes at the current (i) and previous (i−1) time intervals, V G,i and V G,i−1 are the total biogas volumes at the current and previous time intervals, C H,i and C H,i−1 are the fraction of hydrogen gas in the headspace of the bottle measured using gas chromatography at the current and previous intervals, and VH is the total volume of headspace in the reactor [22]. Hydrogen gas in the vessel headspaces was measured periodically using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-14, Japan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a molecular sieve 5A (80/100 6 ft × 1/8 ft) column using Ar as a carrier gas. The temperatures of the injector, detector and column were maintained at 80, 110 and 60 °C, respectively. VFAs were analyzed using a flame ionization detector (ShimadzuGC-8A, Japan) equipped with a glass column packed with 10% REOPLEX 400. Temperatures of the injector port, detector and column were 240, 240, and 140 °C, respectively. All P-values were generated using the one-way ANOVA test of the GraphPad Prism5 software."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of effluent dilution on photoheterotrophic microalgal biomass and hydrogen production,"3.1 Effect of effluent dilution on photoheterotrophic microalgal biomass and hydrogen production Hydrogen production in the combined dark and photoheterotrophic system is illustrated in Fig. 1 . During dark-fermentation (first stage), soluble metabolites (i.e., VFAs and alcohols) produced by the bacterial strains were contained in the fermentation effluent. The microalga, M. reisseri was used to assimilate such soluble metabolites from the effluent as organic carbon source for heterotrophic cell growth in the second stage (Supplementary Fig. 2). Bacterial dark-fermentation showed a maximum hydrogen production of 3125 mL/L using synthetic wastewater at HRT 6 h and pH 5.5, with generation of organic-rich effluent containing 0.8 mM of residual glucose (Fig. 3 b). The experimental conditions were similar to a previous study, since hydrogenic microorganisms were dominant at lower pH values (<5.8) [14]. Effect of dark-fermentation effluent dilution on photoheterotrophic microalgal biomass and hydrogen production is shown in Fig. 1a and b. The residual glucose was completely consumed by M. reisseri in the second reactor (data not shown). Increase of dilution ratio (effluent: deionized water) from 1:0 (undiluted) to 1:2 decreased the biomass and hydrogen production at pH 6.8, 8.0 and 9.0 (Table 1 ), but such correlation of the biomass and hydrogen production with dilution ratio was not observed at pH 4.9. It is assumed that excess hydrogen ions at low pH harm the algal cells directly, leading to acidification of the cell interior and damage the PSII (photosystem II) of photosynthetic system. Maximum biomass production, hydrogen production and HY were 1.35 ± 0.03 g/L, 191.2 ± 14.7 mL/L and 14.3%, respectively, with dilution ratio of 1:0 at pH 8.0 (Table 1 and Fig. 1a and b). High concentrations of organic substrate in the undiluted (1:0) effluent supported the maximum microalgal biomass production, which correlated with the maximum hydrogen production. Dilution of the effluent significantly decreased the biomass production and subsequent hydrogen generation. The variation in the hydrogen production was thus, due to the effect of dilution ratio of substrate on microalgal biomass production. A significant decrease in hydrogen production by photosynthetic bacteria at high dilution ratios has been reported previously [23]. In contrast, a decreased hydrogen production was observed with undiluted effluent [24]. Thus, the effect of effluent dilution should be investigated to optimize the photoheterotrophic microalga biomass and hydrogen production."
8,Effect of light/dark cycle on photoheterotrophic microalgal hydrogen production,"3.2 Effect of light/dark cycle on photoheterotrophic microalgal hydrogen production Light/dark cycle is an essential parameter for photosynthesis-based microalgal hydrogen production. Effect of light/dark cycle on photoheterotrophic hydrogen production by M. reisseri in the combined system is illustrated in Fig. 1c. Light conversion efficiency reached a maximum value of 1.32 ± 0.21% under a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle, compared to 1.05 ± 0.08% with a continuous light cycle (Table 2 ). Higher light conversion efficiency has been reported with 18 h light/8 h dark cycle compared to continuous light [25]. However, continuous light condition supported higher hydrogen production and yield compared to a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle at all tested pH values in the present study (Table 2). Maximum hydrogen production, HY and hydrogen production rate were 191.2 ± 14.7 mL/L, 14.3% and 3.07 ± 0.04 mL/h, respectively, under continuous light illumination at pH 8 with dilution ratio of 1:0. Light serves as the energy source for hydrogen production in photoheterotrophic microalgae and affects the consumption rates of organic acids [26]. Heterotrophic algal hydrogen production was higher (with a shorter lag time) in the presence of light at a pH range of 7.5–8.5 which can be attributed to the availability of excess photon energy to microorganism for more metabolic activities in the presence of light [27]. In chlorophyllous algae, transport of electrons through photosystem associated with the hydrogenase results in hydrogen evolution during the light cycle, while hydrogen production terminates and is consumed during the dark cycle [25,28]. This explains the apparently decreased hydrogen production during the light/dark cycle compared to continuous light condition, indicating that the length of exposure to light and dark has a significant effect on hydrogen production."
9,"Effect of initial effluent pH on microalgal biomass production, and butyrate and acetate consumption","3.3 Effect of initial effluent pH on microalgal biomass production, and butyrate and acetate consumption Effects of initial pH on microalgal biomass production, and butyrate and acetate consumption during photoheterotrophic cultivation of M. reisseri YSW05 are shown in Fig. 2. Microalgal growth was negligible at pH 4.9, which was consistent with a previous study [29]. It is assumed that excess hydrogen ions at low pH harm the algal cells directly, leading to acidification of the cell interior and damage the PSII of photosynthetic system. Initial pH to 6.8 and 8.0, improved the biomass production of M. reisseri YSW05 to 1.26 ± 0.04 and 1.35 ± 0.03 g/L, respectively, but an initial pH of 9.0 decreased biomass to 1.01 ± 0.02 g/L (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 2a and Table 1). Optimum pH values for microalgal growth have been reported in the range of 7.0–8.0 [30]. Phototrophic algae species (Heterocapsa triquetra and Prorocentrum minimum) experienced a reduction in their growth at pH 9.0 and entered stationary growth phase at pH > 9.2 [30]. Linear growth was observed throughout the 2 days of cultivation at pH 6.8 and 8.0. Microalgal growth was faster during the first 2 days of cultivation at pH 8.0 (i.e., 24 h doubling time) compared to other pH conditions. During exponential growth phase, algal cells grow rapidly with a doubling time of 24 h in synthetic media [31]. M. reisseri displayed a similar growth pattern in the present study (Fig. 2a). This result supports our contention that dark-fermentation effluent can be used for microalgae cultivation. VFAs are the major intermediate products of organic waste matter degradation, and short chain VFAs such as acetate, propionate and butyrate can be consumed rapidly by microorganisms in organic wastewater ecosystems. Uptake of acetate and butyrate from the dark-fermentation effluent by M. reisseri YSW05 as a function of pH was investigated (Fig. 2). Low consumption of both acetate and butyrate was observed at pH 4.9, which correlated with the negligible growth observed at the same pH. Increase of the effluent pH to 6.8 and 8.0 improved the removal of acetate to 83.7 and 90.5%, and that of butyrate to 31.8 and 54.5%, respectively, during 2 days of operation. Acetate was preferentially consumed by M. reisseri as more than 90% of it was consumed after 2 days cultivation, while 45.5% of the initial butyrate remained, even after 3 days of cultivation at pH 8.0. Microalga consumed 45% of acetate at pH 9.0, suggesting that carbon limitation is not necessarily the reason for growth inhibition of phototrophs at high pH values. Microbial degradation of propionate and butyrate, in contrast to acetate, is known to be difficult under anaerobic conditions due to thermodynamic limitations. However, in a mixture, acetate is preferentially consumed, followed by propionate and butyrate, due to the carbon number hierarchy in their respective structures [17]. Lower concentrations of acetate had an inhibitory effect on the thermophilic butyrate-degrading co-culture [32]. In this study, the initial concentration of acetate was higher than that of butyrate (Fig. 2), which probably promoted up to 54.5% butyrate consumption at pH 8.0. The ability to reuse organic-rich wastewater effluents, which are abundantly available from municipal and industrial treatment facilities, is one of the greatest advantages of applying microalgae for hydrogen production, making photo-heterotrophic systems an attractive strategy for microalgal biomass production."
10,Effect of initial effluent pH on microalgal photoheterotrophic hydrogen production and hydrogenase activity,"3.4 Effect of initial effluent pH on microalgal photoheterotrophic hydrogen production and hydrogenase activity Hydrogen production by the microalgal photoheterotrophic system with dark-fermentation effluent under different initial pH conditions was estimated using the modified Gompertz equation. Hydrogen production improved from 0.25 ± 0.01 to 8.68 ± 0.13 mM as the initial pH increased from 4.9 to 8.0 (Fig. 2) at dilution ratio of 1:0. Elevation of pH to 9.0 reduced the hydrogen generation to 3.04 ± 0.02 mM. The residual concentrations of butyrate were 4.13 ± 0.11 mM and 6.67 ± 0.34 mM at pH 8.0 and 6.8, respectively (Fig. 2b and c). Hydrogen production demonstrated an effect in response to organic substrate concentration such as acetate (HAc) and butyrate (HBu), indicating that hydrogen production at pH 6.8 was lower than that at pH 8.0. A HY of 14.3% (1.92 ± 0.06) was observed for acetate and butyrate combined substrate at pH 8.0 in the present study (Table 1 and Fig. 2e). Butyrate mixed with acetate contributes mainly to algal cell growth and promotes greater conversion of hydrogen [33]. Hydrogen production obtained with the photoheterotrophic eukaryotic microalgae system in the present study was comparable with greater R max values than other studies (Table 3 ). Kinetic parameters of hydrogen production with dark-fermentation effluent at different initial pH values are shown in Table 1. Increasing initial pH reduced the lag time (λ) and improved the hydrogen production. The average λ of 10 h at pH 4.9 was reduced to 6 h at an initial pH of 8.0 (Table 1). Optimum hydrogen production for the microalga M. reisseri YSW05 was observed at an initial pH of 8.0. In case of green algae, the pH range of 8.0–9.0 has been reported as optimum for hydrogen production [34]. The variation in optimal pH value for hydrogen production among these algae likely reflects their adaptation to different environments. Table 1 also shows pH dependence of the hydrogen production rate; productivity was ca.10 times higher at pH 8.0 than at pH 4.9. These results suggest that the initial pH of effluent should be neutral to slightly alkaline to improve hydrogen production. Hydrogenase activity is an important indicator of hydrogen production. Microalgal hydrogenase activity can be assessed by measuring the hydrogen production with reducing agent, sodium dithionite using the artificial electron mediator MV. Specific hydrogenase activity improved as the initial pH increased from 4.9 to 8.0, which in turn enhanced photo-heterotrophic hydrogen production. Significant hydrogenase activity was observed between pH 6.8–8.0 for green algae such as Closterium littorale, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Scenedesmus obliquus, but comparatively less activity and hydrogen production were detected at lower or higher pH values due to inactivation of hydrogenase [35]. However, in our study, comparable hydrogenase activity was observed at pH values of 4.9 and 9.0 which implicate that the hydrogenase of M. reisseri can be tolerant to operational pH changes used in wastewater treatment, probably due to intrinsic cell structure of algae. Specific hydrogenase activity at an initial pH 8.0 reached a maximum of 22.23 ± 1.95 U/mg-protein (P < 0.0001) at 36 h of cultivation, after which it dropped significantly (Fig. 3). Low hydrogenase activity observed at pH 4.9 and 9.0 may be due to slower metabolic activities, which resulted in significantly less hydrogen production at these pH values (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Oxygen content in the headspace increased due to water splitting and subsequent oxygen evolution in photosystem II during photosynthesis (Fig. 3). The highest hydrogenase activity of 21.3 U/mg-protein was observed at 1.5% headspace oxygen, above which the hydrogenase activity declined. Hydrogenases are extremely sensitive to oxygen, and exposure to low concentrations of oxygen completely inhibits their activity [11]. The hydrogenase activity decreased with increasing partial pressure of oxygen, but its activity was not completely inhibited even at high partial pressure of oxygen (19%), indicating that the hydrogenase of M. reisseri might be oxygen tolerant up to near atmospheric concentration (Fig. 3a). A recent effort in this direction has identified oxygen tolerant hydrogenase in eukaryotic microalgae strains that exhibited hydrogen production at almost atmospheric partial pressure of oxygen [13]. Determining the features of such hydrogenases that make them oxygen tolerant may provide important clues for engineering enzymes for biohydrogen technologies."
11,Conclusions,"Acetate/butyrate rich effluent supported the growth and hydrogen production of microalga M. reisseri. Maximum hydrogen production of 191.2 ± 14.7 mL/L was observed with undiluted effluent at pH 8.0, which correlated with the highest biomass production. Continuous light was more effective for growth and hydrogen production than dark/light. Hydrogenase in this system might be oxygen tolerant as it showed an activity at almost atmospheric oxygen level. Our findings indicate that VFA rich effluents can be used as substrates for cultivation of microalgae and subsequent hydrogen production. The economic evaluation of using renewable carbon sources for promoting algae growth with concurrent hydrogen production should be investigated further."
