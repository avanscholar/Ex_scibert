0,Introduction,"The chemical transformation of carbon dioxide (CO2) to value-added chemicals or fuels has attracted increasing attention in recent years because this technology can simultaneously alleviate CO2 emission and the dependence on fossil fuel [1,2]. Specifically, the hydrogenation of CO2 to produce formic acid is a promising strategy with the development of renewable hydrogen, since the target product is widely used in many applications such as fuel cell, hydrogen production and pesticide [3–5]. Owing to the inherent chemical stability of CO2, efficient realization of this transformation is hugely challenging in the absence of catalysts. Over the last decades, homogeneous catalysts such as ruthenium and iridium pincer complexes have been intensively investigated, in some case, demonstrating outstanding activity and selectivity [6–8]. For example, a high active Ir-based pincer complex catalyst is demonstrated by Nozaki and coworkers showing a high turnover number (TON) of 3500000 [9]. Despite the unparalleled performance, some disadvantages of homogeneous catalysts including separation and recycling issues, the expensive metal centers and air-sensitive ligands greatly hamper the practical application of homogeneous catalysts [10]. In contrast, heterogeneous catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to FA are very attractive because they can be easily separated and recycled. Unfortunately, heterogeneous catalysts generally show inferior catalytic activity related to homogeneous counterparts because of the insufficient atom utilization and low-dispersed active sites. Accordingly, the design of efficient heterogeneous catalysts with abundant active sites for CO2 hydrogenation to FA is a crucial task. Recently, nanostructured noble metals such as Ru, Rh, Ir etc., have been demonstrated as effective catalysts for hydrogenation of CO2 to FA [11–16]. The cost and the scarcity of noble metals pose hurdles for its wide application. On the other hand, transition metals have attracted researchers’ attention owing to their low price and the existence of empty d orbitals for coordinating with CO2 to change the CO bond length, but they usually exhibit poor performance than precious metal catalysts [17–19]. Distinct from the crystalline transition metals, amorphous transition metal borides have been demonstrated superior catalysts in hydrogenation reactions [20–22]. For instance, mesoporous CoB nanochains via using micelle-directed method reveal enhanced activity and selectivity hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol [23]. This amorphous structure provides similar electron-rich active sites and highly dispersed metal centers to those of homogeneous catalysts, where the ligands work as electron donors for metal centers. The electron-rich metals in amorphous catalysts are proposed to facilitate the H2 activation by the formation of metal hydride (MH), then CO2 molecules can insert the MH bond, which is the crucial step for the CO2 activation [24]. In addition, a large number of abundant dangling bonds and unsaturated atoms in amorphous catalysts facilitate the adsorption of reactant gas. Therefore, the development of amorphous metal borides is a promising direction to obtain high catalytic performance for the hydrogenation of CO2 to FA in a heterogeneous catalytic system. Here, amorphous NiRu0.1B alloy catalysts with controlled compositions were synthesized by using a simple chemical reduction method. The obtained catalysts with optimized composition are then used in liquid-phase hydrogenation of CO2 to FA, showcasing an enhanced activity and selectivity (HCOOH yield: 557.3 umol g−1 h−1) related to amorphous NiB (435.7 umol g−1 h−1). The high performance of amorphous NiRu0.1B catalysts can be attributed to the electron-rich metal and abundant unsaturated atoms in amorphous alloys as well as the synergy of bimetals."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All of the chemicals including nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O), ruthenium trichloride (RuCl3), sodium borohydride (NaBH4), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) dimethyl formamide (C3H7NO), ethanol (C2H5OH), and trimethylamine (C6H15N) were purchased from the Aladdin and used without any further purification."
3,Sample preparation,"2.2 Sample preparation The NiB amorphous alloy was prepared by a simple chemical reduction method. Briefly, an aqueous solution of NaBH4/NaOH (2 M/0.2 M) was added dropwise to a NiCl2 solution (0.85 M) at ice-water bath with intense stir under a N2 atmosphere to prevent oxidation. The solution was continued to stir for about 0.5 h until no bubbles were released. An excess of NaBH4 was used to completely reduce the Ni2+ ions. The black precipitate was washed with distilled water to remove soluble boron species and Na+ ions. Finally, the sample was washed with ethanol and stored in ethanol until use. To synthesize NiRuB, the preparation procedures are similar to those of the above NiB amorphous materials. The difference is that NiCl2 solution is replaced with the mixed solution of NiCl2 solution (0.85 M) and RuCl3 solution (1 g/100 mL). The molar ratio of Ni and Ru in the product was determined by feeding different molar ratios of Ni/Ru in the precursor. The as-prepared sample was donated as NiRuxB, where x refers to the theoretical molar ratio of Ru/Ni, (x = mol Ru/Ni). For comparison, the crystallized samples are also prepared by calcination at different temperatures. Briefly, the fresh synthesized NiB and NiRu0.1B samples were centrifuged and dried in a vacuum oven at 70 °C for 6 h. Then the samples were roasted in Ar gas at different temperatures for 2 h. The sample was donated as NiB-y and NiRu0.1B-y (y is different roasting temperature). The preparation of Ni-Ru composite was similar to those of the NiRuB. The difference is that the mixed solution NaBH4/NaOH is replaced with the solution of hydrazine hydrate solution (2.5 M). The as-prepared sample was donated as NiRux, where x refers to the theoretical molar ratio of Ru/Ni, (x = mol Ru/Ni)."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The final Ni and Ru content in the amorphous alloy was determined by an inductive coupled plasma emission spectrometer (ICP, a Jarrel-Asm Atom Scan 2000) (see Table S1). The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm curves were obtained at 77 K with a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 instrument, and the specific surface area (SBET), pore size (DP) and pore volume (VP) were obtained according to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) models, respectively. The phase structure of the material was measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation with the scanning rate of 5 °/min. The morphologies and particle size were investigated by and transmission electronic micrograph (TEM, JEM-2010) equipped with the Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The surface electronic states of the samples were explored by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; ULVAC-PHI PHI5000 Versa Probe using Al Kα radiation)."
5,Activity test,"2.4 Activity test The CO2 hydrogenation reaction was performed in a 50 mL home-made autoclave (Shanghai Yanzheng) (see Fig. S1). Firstly, 500 mg catalyst, 10 mL solvent (DMF) and 2.5 mL triethylamine (TEA) were added with a stirring rate of 600 rpm. The air in autoclave was removed by injecting the H2 (99.99 %). After then, H2 and CO2 with a special ratio were introduced to the desired pressure. The reaction temperature was controlled by a thermo-heating machine with a constant temperature. When the reaction is finished, the temperature is firstly cooled to room temperature. The gaseous products are sampled and analyzed by using a gas chromatograph (HP-PLOT Q column connected to the FID detector and TDX-01 connected to TCD detector). The liquid products were collected and analyzed by both the ion chromatography (Dionex DX-320) equipped with an analytical column (Dionex IonPac AS19-4 μm Analytical Column) and the liquid chromatogram (Agilent 1260) equipped with an analytical column (Agilent C18 analytical column)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Structural characteristics,"3.1 Structural characteristics The crystal phase of as-prepared samples was firstly characterized by the wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 1 a, a broad peak of both NiB and NiRuxB samples at around 45 ° was observed in XRD patterns, indicating the amorphous feature of obtained samples [25]. No other diffraction peaks of NiO, RuO2 or crystalline metals (Ni, Ru) were observed, revealing the probable formation of single-phase amorphous alloys. The introduction of Ru element did not impact the amorphous structure of NiB, as demonstrated in XRD patterns. However, this broad peak of NiB slightly shifted to lower region with increase of Ru content in the amplificated XRD patterns (Fig. 1b), suggesting that the large Ru atoms substituted the small Ni atoms [26]. Generally, amorphous metals are considered as metastable phase, which are very sensitive to high temperature. In order to study the thermal stability of amorphous metals, all the samples were calcinated at different temperatures. The amorphous structure of the NiB and NiRu0.1B samples remains unchanged at 200 °C (Fig. S2a–b). However, the high temperature (> 400 °C) caused to the crystallization of NiB and NiRu0.1B [26]. For the crystallized NiB sample, the crystal phase can be mainly assigned to the crystal type of Ni3B [27]. The morphology and structure of NiB and NiRu0.1B samples were then examined by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). According to Fig. 1c–d, as-prepared NiB samples were shown to be interconnected nanoparticles with an average size of approximately 40 nm, and the HRTEM image indicated the characteristic amorphous structure of NiB with long-range disordered and short-range ordered (Fig. 1e). After introduction of Ru, the particles size of NiRu0.1B sample decrease to ∼25 nm (Fig. 1f–g), indicating that the addition of easily reducible Ru metals is beneficial to improve the particle dispersion. The HRTEM observation showed that NiRu0.1B still maintained an amorphous structure, which is in agreement with XRD analysis (Fig. 1h). Amorphous feature of NiRu0.1B sample was further verified by the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) (Fig. 1i) with the halo-like diffusion rings. The elemental mapping using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) illustrates the spatial distribution of Ru and Ni species, representing the uniform distribution of Ni and Ru in NiRu0.1B alloy. The B was also uniformly dispersed in the NiRuB composite, indicating the sufficient contact between B with Ni and Ru (Fig. 1j–k), and the B content was estimated as Ni70.2Ru5.8B24 (atom%) for NiRu0.1B composite from the EDX result. The final metal content in all samples was determined by ICP analysis, suggesting that the Ru/Ni ratios in all samples were almost close to the feeding molar ratios (Table S1). The specific surface area and pore size analysis of all samples were also summarized in Table S2. The addition of Ru slightly increased the surface area and partially increased the pore volume and pore diameter compared to pure NiB (Fig. S3) owing to the decreased particle size of NiRuB. The high surface area is expected to supply abundant active sites for achieving high activity of CO2 hydrogenation. After the heat treatment of NiB and NiRu0.1B, the specific surface area of the crystallized NiB and NiRu0.1B gradually decreases as the temperature increased owing to the agglomeration. The XPS spectra indicated that Ni species on the surface were mainly present in metallic state with the binding energy of 853.0 eV (Fig. 2 a). Another peak in the XPS spectrum at 856.5 eV can be assigned to the nickel oxide because of the inevitable oxidation exposure at air [28,29]. The Ru species corresponding to the binding energy of 280.3 eV were determined to be metallic state in the NiRu0.1B samples (Fig. 2b) [30]. Another peak at 284.8 can be ascribed to metallic Ru 3d3/2 [31]. The peak located at 188.0 eV can be ascribed to the boron alloying with metals (B-M), whereas the one peak at 191.7 eV corresponds to the boron-oxo species (B-O) [32]. due to the inevitable oxidation exposed at air [33]. The proportion of B-O and B-M were calculated in the Table S3 for indicating the degree of oxidation, revealing that NiRuB was more difficult to oxidize compared with NiB. To some extent, the oxidation species indicated the CO2 hydrogenation activity due to the blocking effect on activate sites. The metallic Ni and Ru in NiRu0.1 was determined with the corresponding peak of 853.5 eV and 280.5 eV, respectively. However, compared to Ni and Ru in NiRu0.1 composite, the binding energies of Ni and Ru in NiRuB alloy moved to the negative regions [34,35], indicating that the metal worked as an electron acceptor. While the binding energy of B shifted towards the high binding energy, indicating that B was an electron donor, allowing the electrons to transfer from B to Ni and Ru (Fig. 2c). The addition of Ru made Ni more receptive to electrons due to the higher electronegativity of Ru (2.2) than Ni (1.91), enhancing the ability of Ni to accept electrons [36]. However, the binding energies of Ni and Ru shifted positively when the excess amount of Ru was added (molar ratio Ru/Ni > 0.15). Fig. 2d showed the H2-TPD spectra of NiB and NiRuB with different molar ratios. As seen in Fig. 2d, NiRuB exhibited two desorption peaks, indicating the existence of two different hydrogen species. The low temperature peak (below 200 °C) was associated to the desorption of weak chemisorption or physical adsorption (Fig. S4a) [37], while the peak at higher temperature (around 300 °C) referred to the adsorbed hydrogen on the metal surface which interacted with B element. All the NiRuB samples exhibit the weak hydrogen adsorbed peak related to pure NiB sample, indicating the weakening MH bond strength on NiRuB catalysts [38]. According to the valence bond theory, the H2 is easy to disassociate and adsorb on electron-deficient nickel site, thus forming the strong Ni-H [39]. However, the incorporation of Ru into NiRuB sample makes the Ni with enriched electrons due to the electronegativity of Ru, resulting in a weaker Ni-H bond, which was conductive to CO2 insertion. In addition, the peak area of H2 desorption peak of NiRuB increased significantly compared to NiB and crystalline NiRuB catalysts probably because amorphous alloy provides the abundant active site for H2 dissociation and adsorption (Fig. S4b) [40]."
8,Catalytic performances,"3.2 Catalytic performances The CO2 hydrogenation reaction was conducted in a home-made reactor and the reaction conditions was optimized by using NiB catalyst. Firstly, the source of all carbon products was verified by replacing CO2 with N2. No products were detected in the absence of CO2, suggesting that CO2 was the only carbon source. As Fig. 3 a shown, the activity of hydrogenation of CO2 was proportional to the total reaction pressure. The CO2 hydrogenation to formic acid is volume reduce reaction. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the equilibrium always moves in the direction of volume reduce [41]. Therefore, the activity of CO2 hydrogenation for producing FA increased with the increase of reaction pressure. The increased collision frequency between CO2 and H2 was also responsible for the high activity at high pressure. The H2/CO2 ratio was also a factor affecting the reaction, demonstrating that the CO2 molecules cannot be efficiently activated at low H2/CO2 ratio, and excess hydrogen impeded the CO2 absorption on the catalyst surface (Fig. 3b). In this study, we selected an optimized H2/CO2 ratio as 0.2. Finally, the solvent property in term of polarity was studied in Fig. 3c, suggesting that the activity performed in the high polarity of the DMF (6.4) was superior than that of low polarity solvents such as ethanol (4.3) and cyclohexane (0.1). The high polarity solvent (DMF) can be fully contacted with the supercritical CO2 (CO2 partial pressure = 7.5 MPa), thus increasing the activity. As shown in Fig. S5, the NiRu0.1 appeared decreased activity relative to NiRu0.1B, which was ascribed to the B electron donating effect to metal, leading to the slowly rate of H2 activation for CO2 hydrogenation, which could be also certified in the XPS analysis. Likewise, the catalysts exhibited an inferior catalytic performance due to the inversion reaction (Fig. S5). In the process of CO2 hydrogenation to formic acid, HCOOH is easily decomposed and reverse to CO2 and H2. Therefore, the organic amines (TEA) in the solution have play a role in hindering the reversed reaction, which enhanced the HCOOH formation. Bimetallic catalysts have been demonstrated as efficient catalysts in the CO2 hydrogenation owing to the synergistic effect [42–44]. In this work, the catalytic performance of NiRuB alloys with different Ru/Ni ratios was then investigated based on the optimized reaction conditions. As shown in Fig. 3d, NiRu0.1B exhibited the highest CO2 hydrogenation activity with the formic acid yield of 557.3 umol g−1 h−1. The increased activity of NiRu0.1B compared to NiB catalyst was ascribed to the smaller particle size and the high surface area, providing more active sites for H2 and CO2 activation. Moreover, the addition of Ru made the Ni sites more electron-rich, which was conducive to the formation of the MH bond and promoted the CO2 insertion into the MH bond. However, further increasing the amount of Ru in NiRuB catalysts resulted in a declined activity because the excess Ru causes the decrease of the electron density on the metal surface, as revealed by XPS. In this study, the addition of Ru also improves the yield of CH4 probably because the Ru metal is a good methanation catalyst [45,46]. The CO2 hydrogenation activity of NiRu0.1B sample calcinated at 200 °C, 400 °C, and 600 °C were also investigated to examine the relation between crystallization and catalytic activity. As shown in Figs. 4 a and S6a, the activity of both NiB and NiRu0.1B decreased with the increase of calcination temperature (crystallization). Lower specific surface area caused by agglomeration at high temperatures is partly responsible for the low FA yield. The leached B from the sample at high temperature led to the decreased electron density of metals (Fig. S7a–c), which is not favor to the formation of the metal-H bond where the CO2 molecule is insufficient to insert. The cyclic stability experiment was conducted by separating the catalyst after the first reaction and reused for the next reaction. The reusability test of amorphous NiB and NiRu0.1B samples was carried out five times under the same reaction conditions (Figs. 4b and S6b). The cyclic stability revealed that the NiB surface was coated with a layer of flocculent after reaction, which blocks the active sites and declines the activity. Slight decreased activity was ascribed to the little Ni and Ru lixiviation (Table S4). The NiRu0.1B exhibited better stability compare with NiB catalysts, because alloying Ni with Ru increases the anti-oxidation ability of Ni (Fig. S8a–b). As shown in Fig. S9, the structure of NiRu0.1B after reaction remained unchanged from the XRD patterns, which indicated the structural stability of the catalyst in CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Further analysis of the XPS results on NiB and NiRuB after cyclic stabilization showed that NiB was more prone to oxidation after the reaction, further demonstrating the antioxidant properties of the bimetallic amorphous alloy in the reaction (Fig. S10). The proposed mechanism for the hydrogenation of CO2 to formate was indicated in Fig. S11. The CO2 was firstly captured by the TEA in the reaction solution, forming carbamate zwitterion intermediate, which can reserve CO2 in the liquid. This weakly chemisorbed CO2 could migrate to the interface of NiRuB and be activated. In the same time, H2 could dissociated to the activated H species on the interface, resulting in the M−H formation. Due to the electron donated effect of B, the M-H was easier to fracture and the carbamate zwitterion intermediates were hydrogenated by the H species, leading to a higher reactivity of nucleophilic attack to the carbon center of CO2 [47,48]."
9,Conclusion,"In conclusion, we prepared the amorphous NiRu0.1B catalysts by using a simple chemical reduction method, displaying a high activity in CO2 hydrogenation under an optimized reaction condition. The excellent catalytic performance was attributed to the high electron density of the metal due to the electron-donating effect of B. These electron-rich metal active sites produce reactive metal hydride species, which were conducive to the CO2 activation. Moreover, the high electronegativity of Ru further increased the electron density of the Ni metal, facilitating the CO2 hydrogenation activity. The addition of Ru in amorphous alloy also prevented the amorphous alloy oxidation at a certain extent, resulting in a well stability compared to pure NiB catalysts. The excellent catalytic activity and recyclability of amorphous metal alloy make it an ideal catalyst for application in the production of useful chemicals from CO2 in the future."
