0,Introduction,"As concerns increase over the supply of oil and changes in global climate, there is an urgent need to develop a clean and renewable energy source. H2 is the most promising succession of fuel evolution, which has several technical, socio-economic and environmental benefits to its credit. H2 has the highest energy density of the known fuels (142kJ/g), and produces water as the sole by-product of combustion (Boyles, 1984). H2 is now universally recognized as an environmentally friendly/safe, renewable energy resource and ideal alternative to fossil fuels (Nejat Veziroğlu and Şahin, 2008). Hydrogen can be produced from non-fossil primary energy by water electrolysis, thermochemical processes, radiolytic processes and biological process. The first three processes are, however, highly energy intensive and not always environmentally friendly (Kothari et al., 2008). Considering global greenhouse gas impact and the facilitation of resource recovery, biological H2 production from renewable biomass, therefore, appears likely to play an important role in bioenergy generation. On the other hand, biological hydrogen production processes using renewable sources even wastewater are less energy intensive and environmental friendly. These processes can be classified as biophotolysis, photo-fermentation, fermentative hydrogen production (FHP) and hybrid systems (Das and Veziroğlu, 2001). Among them, Fermentative H2 production is an exciting research and development area that offers a novel industrial technology for producing H2 from a variety of renewable resources or even wastewaters using a low energy and continuous process (Chong et al., 2009). The use of organic wastes as the carbon source for sustainable energy may possibly define hydrogen's future use. In all feasible fermentation processes exploited by known microorganisms, H2 is produced in combination with volatile fatty acids and/or alcohols. Therefore, the maximum theoretical yield of 12molH2/mol glucose from the complete conversion of glucose to H2 and CO2 is never attained in any known biological in vivo system (Westermann et al., 2007). The metabolic flexibility of these hydrogen producing microorganisms allows the production of a range of end-products. The H2 yield from glucose depends on fermentation pathways and end-products. It has been widely accepted that the highest theoretical yield of 4molH2/mol glucose can be obtained if acetate is the sole by-product of metabolism (Eq. 1); while a maximum 2molH2/mol glucose is associated with butyrate as the end by-product (Eq. 2) (Hawkes et al., 2007). (1) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2H 2 O = 2CH 3 COOH + 2CO 2 + 4H 2 (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 = 2CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 2CO 2 + 2H 2 . In practice, however, high H2 yields are associated with a mixture of acetate and butyrate products, and low H2 yields are associated with propionate and reduced end-products (Westermann et al., 2007). Therefore, it appears there are some crucial metabolic activities in H2 production which may be ignored in the currently proposed metabolic reactions and equations. The typically low H2 yield associated with FHP continues to be a challenge for developing a viable industrial process (Das, 2009; Liu et al., 2008). An enormous research effort has been mounted to improve H2 productivity and yield in the last decade, mostly focussed on searching hydrogen producing microbes and engineering based research, including the online reduction of H2 partial pressure, the optimization of operation conditions, and the isolation of wild, pure and/or mixed cultures of H2 producing organisms (Wang et al., 2008; Levin et al., 2006; Hussy et al., 2003). So far, a H2 yield lower than 2mol/mol glucose has been reported in most studies. Very little is presently known about the attainable yields or the possibilities for improving the yield in the future. From the evolutionary perspective, the low yield is due to the fact that microorganisms capable of producing H2 have developed their metabolic pathways preferentially for cell growth rather than H2 synthesis. It is now expected that hydrogen production yield can be improved significantly by metabolic engineering (Jones, 2008; Davila-Vazquez et al., 2008). Another main problem regarding FHP is the gas separation as the gas produced in FHP process is a mixture of primarily H2 and CO2. The partial pressure of H2 is a particularly important factor for continuous H2 synthesis. Hydrogen formation pathways are sensitive to H2 concentrations and are subject to end-product inhibition. With the increase of H2 concentrations, H2 synthesis decreases and metabolic pathways shift to production of more reduced products. The concentration of CO2 also affects the H2 production rate and yield. The synthesis of succinate and formate uses CO2, pyruvate, and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) via the hexose monophosphate pathway (Das and Veziroğlu, 2001). This pathway competes with reactions in which H2 evolution from NADH is driven by the necessity of deoxidizing the residual NADH of metabolic reactions such as NADH+H+ →NAD+ +H2. Thus rapid gas removal and separation of H2 are essential. In a H2 production system, anaerobic bacteria break down organic substrates via enzymatic oxidation to generate building blocks and produce metabolic energy for growth (Westermann et al., 2007). Fig. 1 outlines possible central metabolic pathways in fermentative H2 production from organic substances (Liu et al., 2006). H2 synthesis is mainly driven by the anaerobic metabolism of pyruvate synthesized during glycolysis (Carere et al., 2008). Pyruvate is oxidized to acetyl-CoA (AcCoA) with cogeneration of formate or ferredoxin which further leads to the formation of H2. In addition, enteric bacteria and some strict anaerobes can produce formate from pyruvate by pyruvate-formate lyase. However, it is unknown whether or not H2 production from formate occurs in strict anaerobes. Except for the recognition of its complexity, the metabolic flux network associated with fermentative H2 production has not been well understood. It is known that various extracellular metabolites including ethanol, acetate, butyrate and lactate can be produced during fermentation. The conversion of pyruvate to these reduced end-products involves oxidation of NADH. The NADH concentration increases if the formation of these metabolites can be blocked. H2 evolution from NADH is driven by the necessity of deoxidizing the residual NADH of metabolic reactions such as NADH+H+ →NAD+ +H2. Thus, if metabolic reactions can be controlled to increase the amount of residual NADH, the H2 yield can be improved further. There is a need for an extensive analysis and detailed understanding of metabolic fluxes and their regulatory circuits leading to H2 formation. It is important to have fundamental knowledge of how the metabolic pathway flux responds to varying genetic and environmental perturbations and whether the pathways can be deliberately redirected towards H2 synthesis rather than the production of these unwanted metabolites. The potential of metabolic engineering for redirecting electron flux to H2 production remains to be exploited (Levin et al., 2006; Oh et al., 2008). It can be rather difficult to predict which of the various approaches could ultimately succeed in substantial enhancement of H2 yields, allowing the H2 production process to become commercially competitive. In order to achieve a high H2 production yield, the cellular metabolic pathways must be redesigned and/or redirected. This requires an extensive analysis and understanding of metabolic pathways and their regulation in the H2-producing microorganisms (Oh et al., 2008). One novel aspect of metabolic engineering is to focus on system of interacting biochemical reactions as a network instead of individual enzymatic reactions (Stephanopoulos et al., 1998). A metabolic network is an abstract representation of cellular metabolism. The analysis of metabolic networks can help to understand and utilize cellular metabolic processes in order to promote hydrogen production for commercial use. Although metabolic pathways associated with hydrogen production have been described in a few anaerobes (Papoutsakis, 1984; Hallenbeck, 2005), how anaerobic bacteria regulate flux distribution under different environmental conditions remains to be elucidated. In this regard, the determination of metabolic fluxes is of central importance to metabolic engineering as the flux is a fundamental determinant of cell physiology and the most critical parameter of a metabolic pathway. In this review paper, we aimed to provide guidelines for improving hydrogen production in strict anaerobes by exploring its metabolic network. In order to achieve that, we will focus on discussing biochemistry fundamentals of metabolic fluxes so as to get a better understanding of the metabolic networks associated with FHP. The paper firstly introduces biochemical reactions and some key enzymes involved in metabolic networks. We describe some main factors that would influence metabolism and outline recently developed and used techniques to analyze metabolic fluxes. Finally, future directions with emphasis on fermentative hydrogen production by strict anaerobes are discussed."
1,Metabolic networks associated with fermentative hydrogen production,"In order to analyze metabolic fluxes in the hydrogen production network, the biochemistry of anaerobic fermentation needs to be fully understood. It is comprised of biochemical reactions and enzymes catalyzing the reactions."
2,Biochemical reactions and metabolic pathways,"2.1 Biochemical reactions and metabolic pathways Fig. 2 shows common biochemical pathways driven by their relevant enzymes involved in the FHP from glucose by anaerobes. It should be noted that some pathways shown in Fig. 2 may not occur in all anaerobes. For example, NADH oxidation by ferredoxin reduction does not seem to exist in many facultative anaerobes. Formate synthesis is not found in all strict anaerobes. The FHP begins with the conversion of glucose to pyruvate by the Embden-Meyerhof (EM) pathway and Pentose phosphate (PP) pathway, or Entner–Doudoroff (ED) pathway in many cases (Fuhrer et al., 2005). The detailed reactions and corresponding enzymes can be found in elsewhere (Oh et al., 2008; Manish et al., 2007; Senger and Papoutsakis, 2008). Here, the equations are only balanced for carbon and reducing energy (NADH and FdH2), so pyruvate production from glucose is presented as Eq. (3) for simplicity. (3) Glucose → 2 Pyruvate + 2 NADH + 2ATP. The availability of pyruvate allows H2 production. In facultative anaerobes, such as Escherichia coli, it proceeds via pyruvate formate lyase (PFL) and formate hydrogen lyase (FHL), and can be written as Eqs. (4a) and (5) (4a) Pyruvate → AcCoA + Formate (5) Formate → H 2 + CO 2 . In a FHP system using strict anaerobes, such as clostridia, H2 production process seems more complicated. It has been proposed that these microorganisms contain an NADH ferredoxin oxidoreductase (NFOR) and H2 production proceeds through pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR), NFOR and hydrogenase, and the relevant reactions are presented as Eqs. (4b), (6a) and (7). However, not all clostridia possess NFOR. Some of them may contain a potential bifurcating hydrogenase which oxidizes NADH and ferredoxin simultaneously to produce H2 (Eq. 6b) (Schut and Adams, 2009). Unlike other clostridia, C. kluyveri uses butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase/Etf complex to catalyze coupled ferredoxin and crotonyl-CoA (a reduction product from AcCoA) reduction with NADH (Eq. 6c) (Li et al., 2008), following H2 production catalyzed by hydrogenase (Eq. 7). (4b) Pyruvate → AcCoA + FdH 2 + CO 2 (6a) NADH ↔ FdH 2 + NAD + (6b) NADH + 2 FdH 2 → 2 H 2 + NAD + (6c) 2 NADH + Crotonyl − CoA ↔ 2NAD + + FdH 2 + Butyryl − CoA (7) FdH 2 ↔ H 2 . Other by-products, including acids and solvents, can be synthesized from some of the major intermediate metabolites, such as phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), pyruvate and AcCoA. The formation of succinate from PEP takes place as Eqs. (8) and (9). (8) PEP + CO 2 → Oxaloacetate (9) Oxaloacetate + NADH → Succinate + NAD + . Lactate production from pyruvate can be represented by Eq. (10). (10) Pyruvate + NADH ↔ Lactate + NAD + . Acetate production from AcCoA through the phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase is one of the most commonly metabolic mechanisms occurring in the FHP processes using all hydrogen producing bacteria, which can be represented by Eq. (11). (11) AcCoA → Acetate + ATP. Production of butyrate and butanol shares the same precursor, butyryl-CoA. The formation of butyryl-CoA from AcCoA through a series of enzymes, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase, β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase and butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase can be represented as Eq. (12). (12) 2 AcCoA + 2 NADH → Butyryl − CoA + 2 NAD + . Butyrate production from butyryl-CoA via phosphotransbutyrylase and butyrate kinase can be represented by Eqs. (13a) or (14b) if butyrate is produced via CoA-transferase. (13a) Butyryl − CoA → Butyrate + ATP (13b) Butyryl − CoA + Acetate → Butyrate + AcCoA. Butanol is produced through butyraldehyde dehydrogenase and butanol dehydrogenase, as shown by Eq. (14). (14) Butyryl − CoA + 2 NADH → Butanol + 2 NAD + . Ethanol production from AcCoA can be represented by Eq. (15). (15) AcCoA + 2 NADH ↔ Ethanol + 2 NAD + . In addition, it is essential to incorporate biomass constituting equations into the network when doing metabolic flux analysis. The methods for constructing biomass constituting equation of a particular organism have been recently reviewed by Senger (2010). There are several biomass constituting equations reported in the literature (Sridhar and Eiteman, 2001; Manish et al., 2007; Oh et al., 2008; Cai et al., 2010). Most of them are not organism-specific and are derived from other well-studied organisms. Some inconsistence has been observed between estimated results and experimental data. Therefore, fundamental studies are required to determine which components of the biomass constituting equation must be specified for a new organism and which can be derived from other organisms. Overall, the distribution of all end-products can significantly affect the hydrogen production yield. Although the hydrogen yield has been addressed frequently in many reports in recent years, maximum and/or theoretical yield in an FHP system using a specific bacterium still remain controversial. In principle, the maximum hydrogen yield may reach 12mol of H2 per mole of glucose (Eq. 17) when glucose is converted to acetate through dark fermentation (Eq. 1), and acetate is further converted to H2 through photo-fermentation (Eq. 16) (Nath et al., 2005). This means that the maximum hydrogen yield of 4mol of H2 per mole of glucose may be obtained when acetate is the only end-product during the fermentative hydrogen production process. However, the theoretical analysis by Chen et al. (2006) reveals that the maximum hydrogen yield on glucose by C. butyricum is 3.26mol/mol when all AcCoA are converted to acetate. Kim et al. (2009) and Oh et al. (2008) reported that 8.7molH2/mol glucose can be obtained if glucose metabolism is directed to the PP pathway and NADP(H) generated from the PP pathway is utilized for hydrogen production, although it might not be thermodynamically feasible. Thus, it seems necessary to include themodynamic constrains in metabolic flux analysis to improve accuracy and applicability in future estimation of the achievable hydrogen yield. (16) 2 CH 3 COOH + 4 H 2 O = 4 CO 2 + 8 H 2 (17) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 H 2 O = 6CO 2 + 12 H 2 ."
3,Hydrogenases and other enzymes,"2.2 Hydrogenases and other enzymes The enzymes directly involved in the metabolism of molecular H2 are named as hydrogenases. The hydrogenases catalyze the reversible conversion of reaction 2H+ +2e− ↔H2 and other metabolic processes, including (i) redox balancing, (ii) derivation of energy from H2 oxidation, (iii) production of reduced intermediates, e.g. NADH, (iv) proton respiration and/or (v) proton-gradient build-up (Valdez-Vazquez and Poggi-Varaldo, 2009). The hydrogenases can be classified into three groups with respect to the metals present in the active sites of their dinuclear active center: the [FeFe] hydrogenases, the [NiFe] hydrogenases and the “metal-free” hydrogenases (Vignais et al., 2001). The first two groups contain iron–sulfur (Fe―S) clusters for electron transport, an Fe atom connecting with CO and CN ligands, while the last group contains a single Fe atom and no iron–sulfur clusters. The function of the first two groups differs from each other in that [NiFe] hydrogenases are about 10−1–10−2 times less active, and less sensitive to oxygen inhibition than [FeFe] hydrogenases (Frey, 2002). They can also be divided into H2 uptake hydrogenases and H2-evolving hydrogenases based on their functions. For example, the E. coli genome encodes four [NiFe]-hydrogenases: hydrogenase-1 (Hyd-1), hydrogenase-2 (Hyd-2), hydrogenase-3 (Hyd-3) and hydrogenase-4 (Hyd-4). The first two are uptake hydrogenases and the other two are H2-evolving hydrogenases, while the Hyd-4 is not expressed without being activated (Vardar-Schara et al., 2008). In Citrobacter amalonaticus Y19, there also exist at least two hydrogenases: a H2-evolving hydrogenase FHL and an uptake hydrogenase similar to the Hyd-1 or Hyd-2 of E. coli. These hydrogenases were induced at different times during cultivation (Kim et al., 2008). Since most H2-producing bacteria contain multiple hydrogenases with different functions, to identify, quantify and characterize the hydrogenases with respect to bacteria, carbon/nutrient sources and process conditions is essential for the enhancement of process performance and H2 yield. Experimental analysis of the enzymatic activities can provide useful information to adjust the group of functionally related fluxes from the corresponding pathways without perturbing the metabolisms (Vignais et al., 2006). The identification and grouping of these specific enzyme activities are important for the manipulation of the enzymatic reactions to enhance H2 synthesis via overexpression of H2-evolving hydrogenase and the elimination of uptake hydrogenases. Other enzymes can also exert control over some or overall metabolic fluxes in the central carbon pathways. These enzymes are responsible for apparently different biological functions in the metabolic network encountering different physiological demands or environmental changes. The inhibition and competition among enzymatic reactions affect H2 formation. However, roles of these multiple enzymes in hydrogen evolution and consumption, enzymatic interactions and energy metabolism have not been well understood. Therefore, the research proposed on how other enzymes affect the production of H2 can be helpful to fill a significant scientific gap in the literature. NFORs catalyzing the reduction of ferredoxin by NADH are other key enzymes involved in an alternate pathway for hydrogen production. The production of H2 from NADH (NADH:H2 pathway) is thermodynamically unfavorable and only occurs under a very low partial pressure of hydrogen. Some studies proposed that this pathway could potentially be utilized to enhance H2 production, as verified by Woodward et al. (2000) through in vitro reconstitution of pentose phosphate pathway-dependent H2 production and by Veit et al. (2008) through constructing a synthetic ferredoxin-dependent NAD(P)H:H2 pathway in E. coli BL21. In these cases, hydrogen production could be significantly improved in a FHP process using anaerobic microorganisms through the NADH: H2 pathway provided. Two key enzymes are involved in lactate production — lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and NAD-independent LDH (iLDH). LDH is responsible for the formation of lactate from pyruvate with the regeneration of NAD+, while iLDH catalyzes the production of pyruvate from lactate. They can be found in a variety of bacterial systems (Garvie, 1980), including aerobes, facultative anaerobes and even strict anaerobes such as Clostridium tyrobutyricum (Zhu and Yang, 2004). The lactate formation from pyruvate is one of the most NADH-consuming pathways. Genetic knockout of lactate formation in Enterobacter aerogenes has resulted in some improvement of the hydrogen yield (Lu et al., 2010). Butyrate formation is another NADH-consuming pathway, which can be divided into a central pathway from acetyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA and the subsequent pathway for the production of butyrate from butyryl-CoA. Genes encoding the enzymes involved in the central pathway have been studied in three different types of organisms. In Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens ATCC 19171T, all six genes: thl (thiolase), crt (crotonase), hbd (β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase), bcd (butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase), etfβ (electron transfer protein [ETF]-β) and etfα (ETF-α), are clustered and arranged in this order, whereas B. fibrisolvens ATCC 51255 and OB156 have the same arrangement except that crt is absent (Asanuma et al., 2005). Clostridium acetobutylicum, C. tetani and C. perfringens were reported to have five of these six genes form a cluster except for thl, which is located elsewhere in the genome (Louis et al., 2007). Two different pathways associated with the formation of butyrate from butyryl-CoA have been described in the literature. Several cluster I clostridia have phosphotransbutyrylase (encoded by ptb) and butyrate kinase (encoded by bk) (Walter et al., 1993; Nölling et al., 2001; Shimizu et al., 2002; Brüggemann et al., 2003), while an alternative pathway that uses a CoA-transferase to transfer the CoA-moiety onto acetate from butyryl-CoA has been described for some butyrate-producing bacteria (Diez-Gonzalez et al., 1999; Duncan et al., 2002)."
4,Key operation factors influencing metabolism and its flux network,"H2 production accompanies the formation of organic acids as metabolic products, but the anaerobes are incapable of further breaking down these acids. The proportion of these products depends upon the microorganism, the substrate and growth conditions. Therefore, understanding how they affect the metabolic pathways during the fermentation is essential. The biochemical kinetics and mechanisms of substrate uptake, cell growth, H2 synthesis, and formation of intermediates and by-products in the FHP process have been investigated in many previous studies. The resulting data can provide fundamental insight into microbial activities and biochemical mechanisms. These parameters are very important for the optimization and modeling of the H2 production process."
5,Hydrogen producing bacteria,"3.1 Hydrogen producing bacteria Different bacterial strains have different abilities to produce hydrogen and to contribute the metabolic network, depending on metabolic pathways they employ under various conditions. Some anaerobes may possess special metabolic routes, which make them differ from others. For example, the hydrogen formation pathways employed by facultative and strict anaerobes can be very different. Some species, including E. coli (Fischer and Sauer, 2003), Bacillus subtilis (Dauner et al., 2001; Zamboni and Sauer, 2003), Corynebacterium glutamicum (Wittmann and Heinzle, 2002), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Gombert et al., 2001) and C. amalonaticus (Oh et al., 2008), rely mainly on the EM pathway and in some cases on the PP pathway for glucose metabolism, while some other species, such as Zymomonas mobilis (Fuhrer et al., 2005), utilize the ED pathway to metabolize glucose. The most important difference among these pathways is energy generation, which may affect cell growth and final product accumulation. According to the studies conducted by Oh et al. (2008) and Kim et al. (2009), the maximum hydrogen yield can be obtained if metabolic fluxes are redirected to the PP pathway which generates more NADH for hydrogen production. Thus it would be necessary to examine which pathway is the main route for glucose catabolism by hydrogen-producing strains. In a study by Lin et al. (2007), fermentation product yield was compared among four Clostridium species under the same growth conditions with glucose and peptone as substrates (Table 1 ). The result showed that C. beijerinckii performed the highest hydrogen yield, while C. tyrobutyricum possessed the lowest yield. It also showed that in addition to production of common products including acetate, butyrate, carbon dioxide and hydrogen, ethanol was only produced in the fermentation process using C. acetobutylicum M121, while propionate could be produced by C. butyricum ATCC19398. Using the species C. butyricum, lactate formation has so far only been found in FHF systems using strains of C. butyricum ATCC19398 (Lin et al., 2007) and W5 (Wang and Jin, 2009), while ethanol was produced by strains of C. butyricum TISTR1032 (Pattra et al., 2008), CGS5 (Chen et al., 2005) and W5 (Cai et al., 2010). It is thus reasonable to note that strain C. butyricum ATCC19398 was able to produce hydrogen from glucose with a higher hydrogen yield than the other three strains of C. butyricum. Ren et al. (2007) reported that the distribution of fermentation products varied with strains. Except the acetate as the common product using all six species tested, C. populeti grown on cellobiose was found to produce more butyrate than the other species. No detectable ethanol was found in their processes. In contrast, C. phytofermentans produced a significant amount of ethanol and no detectable butyrate. As a result, hydrogen production by C. phytofermentans was the lowest among all six species. From the above, it may be concluded that a strain for a FHP favoring ethanol formation could lead to a low hydrogen production."
6,Substrates,"3.2 Substrates Substrates can affect metabolic pathways employed by strains and thus the concentrations and distribution of the end-products. For example, when C. butyricum VPI 3266 was grown on glucose–glycerol mixtures instead of glucose alone, 1,3-propanediol was formed and the production of other acids, resulting in low H2 yield (Saint-Amans et al., 2001). This indicates that the formation pathway of 1,3-propanediol is only activated when glycerol is used as a substrate, leading to reducing hydrogen production. In a study by Ramachandran et al. (2008), hydrogen production and end-product synthesis patterns by C. termitidis CT1112 were compared in batch fermentation with cellobiose or α-cellulose. A high H2 production yield was obtained by the C. termitidis using α-cellulose as a carbon source. This result was in consistence with synthesis patterns of soluble end-products, as this strain appeared to be favorable for acetate production rather than ethanol and lactate synthesis when it grew on α-cellulose (Ramachandran et al., 2008). In another study by Wang et al. (2008), the impacts of carbon sources on hydrogen production by C. butyricum W5 were investigated and it was found that molasses fermentation demonstrated a high hydrogen yield, while accumulating more butyrate and less lactate among different sugars (glucose, fructose, lactose, sucrose, waste potato starch and molasses) utilized. There are also some other studies about the effect of various substrates on hydrogen production, as summarized in Table 2 . It seems that different strains have their own favored carbon sources for hydrogen production. Thus, it is necessary to investigate what kinds of carbon sources are preferable by target hydrogen producing strains. A number of studies revealed that substrate concentrations have a great impact on carbon distribution and hydrogen production. Oh et al. (2002) reported FHP by Rhodopseudomonas palustris P4 using glucose as a substrate. Hydrogen production rate increased with increasing glucose concentration, but the hydrogen yield consistently decreased. It was suggested that with the increase of glucose concentration, more carbon flux is directed to the formation of reduced by-products such as ethanol rather than organic acids (Oh et al., 2002). Jo et al. (2009) found that initial glucose concentrations had a strong influence on the formation of metabolites, such as butyrate, acetate, lactate, hydrogen, etc., according to the overall carbon distribution in C. tyrobutyricum JM1. When the initial glucose concentration increased from 27.8 to 222.4mM, hydrogen production increased with a concomitant increase in butyrate and acetate concentrations, and decrease of lactate concentration. Beyond this threshold, hydrogen production decreased with concomitant decrease of butyrate and acetate, whereas lactate and ethanol productions increased. A similar trend with xylose in hydrogen production by Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum W16 was proved in the studies by Ren et al. (2008). From the above, a low hydrogen yield may be resulted from high initial substrate concentrations. This may be due to growth inhibition by substrate and fermentative products, or both. Therefore, to select strains with tolerance to high levels of substrates and accumulating products could be a helpful strategy for enhancing hydrogen productivity and yield."
7,pH,"3.3 pH The pH is believed to be the most important growth parameter which effects significantly on the metabolic and enzymatic reactions, and the product distribution in FHP process. Many hydrogen producing bacteria are pH sensitive for their biochemical performances. Zhu and Yang (2004) found that the metabolic pathway in C. tyrobutyricum ATCC 25755 was switched from butyrate to lactate and acetate formation when pH decreased from 6.3 to 5.7 or less. The metabolic shift was found to be associated with pH effects on the expression levels of various acid-forming enzymes. According to the specific enzyme activity, PTB, which is responsible for butyrate formation, and iLDH, catalyzing lactate utilization, had a high expression levels at pH 6.3. In contrast, a high expression level of PTA, which is responsible for acetate formation, and LDH, catalyzing lactate production, were detected at pH 5.0. The same metabolic pathway shift was observed in C. tyrobutyricum JM1 as changing pH from 6.3 to 6.0, resulting in decreasing hydrogen production with a decrease in butyrate concentrations (Jo et al., 2008). Cai et al. (2010) found that C. butyricum W5 had the lowest hydrogen yield at pH 7.0 when lactic acid was the dominant acid and more ethanol was produced, while the highest hydrogen yield occurred at pH 6.0 when butyric acid became the dominant acid and less ethanol was produced. These results revealed that a high hydrogen yield was accompanied by a high butyrate production, while the low hydrogen yield was associated with more lactate and/or ethanol produced (Calli et al., 2008). Chen et al. (2005) also proved that optimal hydrogen production was accompanied by a high ratio of butyrate to total soluble by-products in the case of fermentation with C. butyricum CGS5. However, a high butyrate production was obtained at pH 5.5, and butyrate production decreased when pH increased from 5.5 to 6.5 (Chen et al., 2005). Therefore, pH effects on product formation vary among microorganisms, and it is necessary to characterize how pH affects fermentation performances using different species."
8,Metabolic flux analysis,"The metabolic fluxes of a biological production system represent the degree of engagement of various pathways in overall cellular functions and metabolic processes. The quantification of the magnitude of pathway fluxes in vivo is very important for metabolic engineering design in order to maximize valuable metabolite production. Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) is a powerful tool to calculate intracellular fractional changes of metabolic system outputs (metabolic fluxes and chemical composition/concentration) in response to extracellular perturbations of various metabolic and process parameters (enzyme activity and operation conditions) (Hawkes et al., 2002). MFA quantifies intracellular fluxes on the basis of stoichiometric analysis and mass balances (Stephanopoulos et al., 1998), and provides a comprehensive understanding of the regulation underlying a metabolic network despite the overwhelming complexity of cellular responses. It can analyze the capability of the H2 producing bacterium to produce H2 and other metabolites. This information would allow the development of metabolic pathways and process optimization strategies that favor H2 synthesis, leading to a high H2 yield. Currently, there are two measurement-based techniques that can be used to analyze fluxes in the metabolic network, namely metabolite balance techniques and tracer-based techniques, and MFAs based on the two techniques are flux balance analysis and fluxomics respectively. Several computer programs have been developed for both MFAs to assist with flux resolution."
9,Flux balance analysis,"4.1 Flux balance analysis Flux balance analysis was first developed to determine intracellular fluxes from measured extracellular fluxes, such as substrate uptake rates and product formation rates by applying metabolite balancing, which is based on the stoichiometry of all reactions in the metabolic network (Varma and Palsson, 1994). Before any calculation can be made, the reaction network from substrate to products needs to be constructed and pseudo-steady state needs to be assumed. Under this assumption, the incoming fluxes of each intracellular metabolite pool balance the outgoing fluxes, which can be described as one linear equation for each intracellular pool given below: d x / d t = S ⋅ v = 0. In this equation, x is the m ×1 concentration vector for intermediates; t is time; S is the m × r stoichiometric matrix in which the element of the ith row and jth column corresponds to the stoichiometric coefficient of metabolite i in reaction j; v is a r ×1 reaction rate vector; and the degree of freedom is defined as F= r − m where m represents the number of intracellular metabolites and r means the number of reactions. If all F fluxes can be measured, the system becomes determined and all the fluxes can be calculated; if not all F fluxes can be measured, it becomes undetermined although sometimes it can be solved by optimization programs (Oh et al., 2008). Flux balance analysis has been widely used for estimating metabolic pathway fluxes and their response to genetic and environmental perturbations in several microorganisms (Manish et al., 2007; Sauer et al., 1996). In a study by Cai et al. (2010), an in silico central metabolic flux model for anaerobic glucose fermentation was constructed for hydrogen production by C. butyricum W5 and used to predict the phenotypic behavior of this strain during the FHP when the specific growth rate was chosen as an objective function. MFA indicated that carbon partitioning at three key nodes (PEP, pyruvate and AcCoA nodes) in C. butyricum W5 was affected in varying degrees by operational pH and initial glucose concentration, respectively (Fig. 3, Fig. 4 ). At the PEP node, the fraction of carbon flux to OAA increased with a simultaneous decrease in the fraction to pyruvate when pH decreased from 7.0 to 6.5 or when initial glucose concentration increased from 4g/L to 8g/L, respectively. At the pyruvate node, the fraction of carbon flux to lactate consistently decreased with a decrease in pH from 7.0 to 6.0 or initial glucose concentration from 10g/L to 4g/L, respectively. By comparison, the fraction of carbon flux to AcCoA at first decreased and then increased when the conditions changed as above. Carbon partitioning at the AcCoA node between acetate and butyrate was not much affected by the pH changes, but varied under different initial glucose concentrations. The fraction from AcCoA to ethanol at pH 7.0 was about three times higher than that at other pH values. From the above analysis, it seems that none of the three nodes is rigid nodes. MFA has also been used for developing strategies to optimize the productivity of many metabolites such as organic acids (Delgado and Liao, 1997), amino acids (Vallino and Stephanopoulos, 1993), alcohols (Çakır et al., 2004), antibiotics (Kim et al., 2004) and hydrogen (Oh et al., 2008)."
10,Fluxomics,"4.2 Fluxomics If not all intracellular fluxes can be solved by flux balance analysis, tracer-based techniques can be used as complementary methods (Tang et al., 2009). The methods discussed here use substrates labeled with isotopes 13 C, and then labels are distributed over different metabolic pathways until an isotopomeric steady state is reached. In this state, isotopomer distributions can be measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and mass spectrometry including liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS), gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Typically, the fluxomics approach begins with analysis of the labeling patterns in proteinogenic amino acids from biomass. Emmerling et al. (2002) utilized the labeling of proteinogenic amino acids using NMR to estimate the intracellular carbon flux distribution in wild-type and pyruvate kinase-deficient E. coli. Zhao and Shimizu (2003) utilized amino acid labeling and GC–MS to estimate the flux distribution in the metabolic network of E. coli K12 growing on different carbon sources. The same approach was used for examination of metabolic flux response to overexpression and modification of glucose 6-phosphatase dehydrogenase during l-lysine production in C. glutamicum (Becker et al., 2007). Labeling patterns in the amino acids using GC–MS and NMR were used to quantify intracellular fluxes and investigate the central carbon metabolism of Synechocystis species (Yang et al., 2002). Additionally, the labeling of amino acids measured by GC–MS, as well as that of secreted metabolites by NMR, were used to determine the flux distribution through different pathways in Actinobacillus succinogenes (McKinlay et al., 2007) and how intracellular fluxes respond to CO2 and H2 perturbations (McKinlay and Vieille, 2008). Alternatively, the 13 C MFA experiments can also be performed by measuring intracellular amino acids using NMR (Wahl et al., 2004; Drysch et al., 2004), GC–MS (Kromer et al., 2004) and LC–MS (Iwatani et al., 2007); or by measuring secreted metabolites using MALDI-TOF-MS (Wittmann and Heinzle, 2001), GC–MS (Wittmann and Heinzle, 2002), and capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOF-MS) (Toya et al., 2007). In order to identify fluxes from the labeling patterns, a mathematical model is firstly required to describe the relationship between fluxes and the labeling state of the system over time. Thus several different methods have been widely studied, including the iterative averaging isotopomer method (Schmidt et al., 1999), the cumomer method (Wiechert et al., 1999), the isotopomer path tracing method (Forbes et al., 2001), the fractional labeling method (Riascos et al., 2005), the elementary metabolic unit method (Antoniewicz et al., 2007) and the nonlinear optimization procedure (Suthers et al., 2007). The next step is to solve the fluxes that best explain the observable data using the Nelder–Mead method, sequential quadratic programming, the range-restricted evolutionary algorithm, the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm, the generalized reduced gradient method, trust region methods, or a spatial branch and bound algorithm (Tang et al., 2009; Riascos et al., 2005; Wiechert et al., 2001)."
11,Computer programs implementing MFA,"4.3 Computer programs implementing MFA Although the metabolic network is assembled in vitro, mathematical modeling of the complicated network requires appropriate software program, which supports flux analysis independently of kinetic mechanism and parameters. The software provides a powerful tool for estimating and predicting the stoichiometry of the different products during H2 production and may enable the design of much better control operation strategies, improving the performance of H2 production. Table 2 lists some common software programs available for MFA, and summarizes their advantages, disadvantages and functions. All the reviewed programs are free of charge for non-commercial usage. The first five are for flux balance analysis while the last three are for fluxomics. The software MetaFluxNet, developed by Lee et al. (2003), was first applied for large-scale metabolic flux analysis of E. coli to demonstrate its usefulness, and then applied in metabolic engineering of E. coli for the enhancement of succinic acid production (Lee et al., 2005), as well as metabolic flux analysis of hydrogen production in C. amalonaticus Y19 (Oh et al., 2008). The FluxExplorer was developed later and integrated more analytical methods than MetaFluxNet, including minimization of metabolic adjustment (Papp et al., 2004; Segre et al., 2002) and singular value decomposition (Famili and Palsson, 2003; Price et al., 2003). It also supports systems biology mark-up language (SBML) and has been successfully used to rebuild a metabolic network in mammalian mitochondria (Luo et al., 2006). The third program, CellNetAnalyzer, is a package for MATLAB (Mathworks, Inc.) and the further development of FluxAnalyser. It can be used to analyze metabolic networks as well as signaling and regulation networks (Klamt et al., 2006; Klamt et al., 2007). The fourth, OptFlux, is an open-source and modular software for in silico metabolic engineering (Rocha et al., 2010). It is the only one that is able to perform strain optimization among all software discussed. These four software programs are all based on linear programming techniques to calculate the intracellular fluxes. The fifth one, COMPFlux, is based on non-linear programming. It has been applied to analysis of intracellular fluxes in the bacterium C. acetobutylicum (Desai et al., 1999) and the yeast S. cerevisiae (Maczek et al., 2006). Other programs listed in Table 2 were specially developed for 13 C data analysis. Among them, 13C-FLUX is the most powerful tool which can deal with any metabolic network, any type of flux assumptions and all measurement techniques. The 13C-FLUX requires quite a complex set of input data for the system (Wiechert et al., 2001). In comparison, FiatFlux (Zamboni et al., 2005) is easier to operate, and can calculate metabolic flux ratios exclusively from MS detected 13 C data while FCAL is mainly used to analyze metabolic flux ratios from NMR detected 13 C data (Szyperski et al., 1999; Maaheimo et al., 2001; Solà et al., 2007; Jouhten et al., 2009). Additionally, several other programs can be used to calculate fluxes, such as MATLAB (Wittmann and Heinzle, 2002; Becker et al., 2007) and Metabologic (Zhu et al., 2003). These programs are not discussed here because they are complicated and require programming experience. Although many techniques and software programs have been developed for analysis of metabolic flux network as reviewed above, flux balance analysis has not been widely applied to hydrogen production in strict anaerobes. It would be worthwhile to utilize MFA for elucidation of the metabolic network for hydrogen production in strict anaerobes and to consequently determine which pathway has the potential for genetic modification and will contribute to higher H2 yield."
12,Prospects of fermentative hydrogen production by strict anaerobes,"Strict anaerobes were believed to have an additional pathway contributing to hydrogen generation (Vardar-Schara et al., 2008). However, the highest yield achieved in strict anaerobes has been reported to be lower than 3mol of H2 per mole of glucose in the literature. Facultative anaerobes Enterobacter cloacae IIT-BT 08 and E. coli BL-21 have been found to be able to enhance their hydrogen yield up to 3.9mol of H2 per mole glucose by random mutagenesis followed by decreasing hydrogen partial pressure (Kumar and Das, 2000; Mandal et al., 2006) and to 5.2mol of H2 per mole glucose by introduction of a synthetic NAD(P)H:H2 pathway (Veit et al., 2008) respectively. In order to exploit their potential for hydrogen production, future directions are discussed as follows."
13,Reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic network for hydrogen-producing strict anaerobes,"5.1 Reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic network for hydrogen-producing strict anaerobes With the advent of genomics, genome-scale metabolic networks have been reconstructed for a number of organisms including Clostridium sp., and were used to examine the potential for improving production of biofuels such as butanol and ethanol. Lee et al. (2008) reconstructed the C. acetobutylicum network consisting of 502 reactions and 479 metabolites. It was used as an in silico model to investigate the effect of hydrogen flux on solventogenic metabolism. It was confirmed that decreasing hydrogenase flux is one of the most promising strategies for improving the butanol-producing capability of C. acetobutylicum. Roberts et al. (2010) presented a genome-scale model consisting of 577 reactions and 525 intracellular metabolites for C. thermocellum and used it to predict gene deletions and environmental conditions that would enhance ethanol production. It was found that gene deletions to inhibit acetate production and NADH oxidation, as well as the addition of lactate or malate to the growth medium, can increase ethanol secretion. Techniques for the reconstruction of metabolic networks in microorganisms have been well developed and used, as reviewed by Feist et al. (2009). It is possible to reconstruct genome-scale metabolic network for other Clostridium that is capable of producing hydrogen and will facilitate efforts to engineer Clostridium for hydrogen production."
14,Applying MFA to better understand the metabolic network associated with hydrogen yield in strict anaerobes,"5.2 Applying MFA to better understand the metabolic network associated with hydrogen yield in strict anaerobes The metabolic pathways of hydrogen production by some strict anaerobes such as C. acetobutylicum have been described in many papers. However, most of them have multiple metabolic pathways, and they are liable to change pathways in accordance with environmental conditions. Thus, the response of the metabolic fluxes to different situations needs to be considered. Although MFA has been widely reported to elucidate the complex metabolic network in various species, only MFA using metabolite balancing was applied to fermentative hydrogen production by facultative anaerobes. The application of MFA should be extended to strict anaerobes that have the potential for hydrogen production. Thanks to recent development of genetic tools available for strict anaerobes (Desai and Papoutsakis, 1999; Tummala et al., 2003; Green and Bennett, 1998; Zhu, 2003; Heap et al., 2007), gene deletion studies can be applied to MFA to validate the genome-scale model. In order to improve the accuracy of in silico MFA, incorporation of the tracer based technique and thermodynamics constrains into genome-scale model is encouraged for increasing our understanding of the behavior of strict anaerobes and may lead to improvements in hydrogen production."
15,Improve hydrogen production in strict anaerobes via metabolic engineering,"5.3 Improve hydrogen production in strict anaerobes via metabolic engineering It has been suggested that the combination of dark and photo-fermentation has the potential to achieve hydrogen yields close to the theoretical stoichiometric yield of 12mol of H2 per mole of glucose (Das, 2009). However, the hydrogen yield in dark fermentation needs to be significantly improved before combination with photo-fermentation. Based on refined genome-scale model of strict anaerobes, MFA can be performed to predict metabolic engineering strategies that would improve hydrogen production. With the availability of genetic tools developed for strict anaerobes, it will be possible to significantly enhance hydrogen production via metabolic engineering."
