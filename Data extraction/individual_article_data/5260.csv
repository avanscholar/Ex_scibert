0,Introduction,"The South China Sea is rich in oil and gas resources. U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates the South China Sea contains approximately 11 billion barrels of oil and 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas (NG) in proved and probable reserves [1]. It is also reported that oil and gas resources in the South China Sea make up one third of China’s total oil and gas resources, and equaling 12 percent of the world total [2]. However, the NG in the South China Sea is quite different from that in other inland areas due to its high concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is widely distributed from 7% to more than 80% [3]. It cannot be transported directly because commercial NG transportation requires CO2 concentration in pipeline NG and liquefied NG should be lower than 2% and 0.2%, respectively [4]. To utilize these CO2-rich NG conventionally, a large amount of CO2 needs to be removed from offshore NG, which will not only increase energy consumption and lead to 2.5 ~ 7% of NG loss in the processing unit [5]. but will also cause greenhouse effect since most of the removed CO2 is released into the atmosphere directly. The key alternative to solve this problem is using CO2 as feedstock integrated with NG conversion process to produce high value-added products. NG-CO2 dry reforming, combining CO2 and natural gas to produce synthesis gas (syngas) mixed with hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO), is one of the most critical technologies in the integrated system and has gained much attention for many years [6–8]. The autothermal NG-CO2 dry reforming technology developed by our laboratory has been successfully applied for industrial demonstration with daily conversion and utilization of CO2 up to 60 ton [9,10] (Fig. 1 ). Compared with conventional NG-steam reforming technology, the mole ratio of H2 to CO in the syngas out of NG-CO2 dry reforming reactor is lower than 1.2 [9] which does not adapt for most syngas conversion processes like methanol synthesis, conventional Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis etc. However, it is more suitable for the syngas to produce high-value added linear olefins via F-T technology developed by our laboratory [11–13]. Unlike conventional F-T process, the F-T to olefins (FTO) technology requires low H2/CO mole ratio (less than1) and can reach high selectivity of light olefins with carbon number lower than 15 and total olefins up to 60% and 80%, respectively [14]. Furthermore, the carbon number of FTO products shows a significant narrow range and high selectivity distribution, selectivity of C2-C15 compositions accounting for more than 90% [14]. In order to verify the feasibility of original FTO synthesis process and find suitable reaction conditions after enlarged production, an FTO pilot plant has recently been under construction in Shaanxi province, China (Fig. 1). The pilot plant is mainly comprised of the core FTO synthesis unit, decarbonization unit and oil washing unit, which are the basis for us to model related process. However, syngas production unit and products refinement units are not included in the pilot plant. The production capacity of FTO pilot plant is 5000 tons/a of mixed hydrocarbons which are simply separated as heavy hydrocarbons, light hydrocarbons and by-product gas. CO2-rich NG dry reforming integrated with FTO technology to produce high value-added LAO products has great potential in China because there is a huge gap between China’s large demand for linear olefin (LAO) and current low production capacity (Fig. 2 ). Based on the report from IHS MarkitTM, China consumed 13% of global linear alpha-olefins (LAO) but only produced lower than 2% in 2016 [15]. Moreover, the present comonomers of C8+ LAO products in China almost completely depend on importing [16]. Thus, it is necessary to analyze the technical and economic feasibility of this promising and urgently needed technology in China. There are many studies on natural gas dry reforming [9,17–19] and direct synthesis of light olefins from syngas [12,20–22]. However, most of them concentrate on preparation, improvement, structure and property evaluation of related catalysts [7,11,23,24]. Aramouni et al. [23] reviewed and studied the effects of active metals, supports and promoters on the activity and stability of selected catalysts. Zhao et al. [20] modified the iron catalyst for direct synthesis of light olefin and improved its selectivity to light olefins, activity and stability in the reaction. Several studies have been conducted on the thermo-dynamic [18,25], kinetic [26], exergy and optimal operation [19] of dry reforming [19] and FTO reactors [27,28]. Abdel et al. [18] studied the effect of particle size on thermodynamic equilibrium of methane dry reforming and carbon formation. The optimal operating conditions were found to be close to carbon limits, highlighting the need for active metal particle size to be less than 5–6 nm to minimize coking. Wang et al. [29] investigated the influence of reactor structure and operating conditions on dry reforming of methane (DRM), using a two-dimensional reactor model. Xie et al. [26] proposed a comprehensive and thermodynamically consistent micro-kinetic modeling for the DRM reaction under different reaction conditions. Mandić et al.[27] studied the dynamic performance of a milli-scale fixed bed reactor for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) using a dynamic pseudo-homogeneous 1D reactor model and found that the reactor simulations showed highly nonlinear behavior due to phenomena coupling and fast dynamics due to system small scale and intensified rates within. A few studies focus on techno-economic analysis of CO2-rich natural gas reforming to produce syngas and chemicals [5,30,31]. Graciano et al. [5] analyzed an integrated process for production of liquid transportation fuels from CO2-rich natural gas found in the new offshore fields of the Brazilian coast, using the tri-reforming and Fischer-Tropsch technologies. Hernández et al. [32] optimized the operating conditions of a process that reforms biogas with CO2 and/or steam to produce methanol using a mathematical optimization approach. Many studies performed the feasibility analysis and techno-economic comparisons of coal/ natural gas/ oil based olefins production systems [33–38]. Vincenzo assessed the techno-economic performance of two technologies for olefins production from naphtha and natural gas [34]. Xiang et al. [33]. compared the techno-economic performances of coal based methanol-to-olefins (CMTO) plant and coal based Fischer–Tropsch-to-olefins (CFTO) process and found that the techno-economic performance of CFTO is inferior to that of the CMTO due to the lower olefins selectivity of CFTO process. Man et al. [39] proposed a novel co-feed process of coke oven gas assisted coal to olefins (CTO) and found that the energy efficiency of the co-feed process increases about 10%, while at the same time, the life cycle carbon footprint is reduced by around 85% in comparison to the conventional CTO process. To the best of our knowledge, there is little research on techno-economic analysis of direct synthesis technology of light olefins from syngas due to its immatureness and complexity in downstream separation units. Most studies concentrate on the feasibility evaluation of diesel, gasoline and other liquid fuels production via Fischer-Tropsch process from biomass and other fossil fuels [5,38,40]. Moreover, research on design, simulation and techno-economic evaluation of the integrated process which couples CO2-rich NG dry reforming and direct synthesis of light alpha olefins via FTO technology is still rare. Therefore, in order to achieve highly efficient conversion and utilization of CO2 rich natural gas in South China Sea and solve the current situation of alpha olefin supply shortage in China, we analyzed the feasibility of CO2-rich NG dry reforming integrated FTO process to high value-added linear alpha olefins system. Due to the complex composition and wide carbon number distribution in the mix at the FTO reactor outlet, we designed specific separation and purification processes to obtain urgently needed final products by the market. The final products were separated as C2-C7 monomer olefins, poly alpha olefin (PAO) base oil, C1-C4 monomer alcohol, detergent alcohol, plasticizer alcohol etc… Based on the market demand and prices of related products, economic performance of the whole linear alpha olefin production system was evaluated in order to support a new way for CO2-rich natural gas utilization."
1,Methodology,
2,Process design and simulation,"2.1 Process design and simulation In this work, the flowsheet simulation software Aspen Plus is used to obtain the mass and energy balance sheet of the integrated system. The evaluated plant is assumed newly constructed in China. The feedstock is offshore natural gas from the South China Sea which contains high CO2 composition (39.4%mol). The production capacity of this plant is 507,610 tons of hydrocarbons & alcohols, including 69.2% of olefins, 9.1% of alkanes, 21.7% of alcohols (Table 5). Meanwhile, the system generates 29,072 tons of hydrogen by-product. A brief process diagram of CO2-rich NG dry reforming for linear olefins production system is shown in Fig. 3 . Natural gas with ~ 40% carbon dioxide, is mixed with CH4 and part of recycling CO2 from FTO process, together with oxygen enter the dry reforming reactor. Syngas with H2/CO molar ratio of 0.5 out of dry reforming unit is mixed with recycling gas from multistage cooling and separation unit. Then the mixture gas will enter the FTO synthesis reactor at 255℃ after a series of heat exchanging. The reaction pressure of FTO synthesis is 0.5 MPaG [14]. Outlet gas from FTO reactor is cooled to 120℃ and then enters flashing tank I to be separated into heavy hydrocarbons and gaseous product. The gaseous product will be further cooled to 40℃ and enters flashing tank II to be separated into light hydrocarbons and gaseous flow. The gaseous flow is compressed to 3MPaG and separated partial light hydrocarbons which will enter olefins refinement unit together with other light products from flashing tank II and multistage cooling and separation unit. Light hydrocarbons will be further refined into the following products [41]: ① the final high purity monomer olefins (1-pentene, 1-hexene and 1-heptane); ② n-alkanes rich products (C5, C6, C7 and other mixture) which will be processed into individual n-alkanes via hydrofining technology in subsequent alkane separation unit; ③ C8 ~ C12 rich hydrocarbons and other oxygenated chemicals within this boiling point range which will be further processed in fraction cutting and polymerization unit; ④ heavy hydrocarbons (C13+) which will be further treated via hydroformylation technology in fraction cutting unit. Gaseous flow from compression unit enters water scrubbing and decarbonization unit to remove carbon dioxide and alcohol& aldehyde components and produce clean light hydrocarbons. Carbon dioxide will be partly recycled to dry reforming unit for H2/CO molar ratio adjustment. Then, the light hydrocarbons enter multistage cooling and separation unit to produce monomer olefins (ethylene, propylene and butylene), alkanes (methane, ethane, propane and butane), C5 ~ C7 hydrocarbons, C8 ~ C12 hydrocarbons and flue gas. Methane separated from light hydrocarbons will be recycled to dry reforming unit for natural gas supplement. Final products out of alcohols refinement unit are monomer alcohols from ethanol to heptanol, plasticizer alcohol and detergent alcohol [41]. Final products out of alkane separation unit are monomer alkane products from pentane to C15 alkane and C16+ alkane mixture. Fig. 4 is the Aspen models we built to calculate the mass and energy balance of CO2-rich NG dry reforming for LAO production system [42,43]. In view of the complexity, the simulation was performed using “hierarchy” blocks, i.e., each major subsystem was calculated separately before being integrated into the total system. The NRTL-RK method was selected as the global property method. The blocks were divided into following parts: CO2-rich NG dry reforming to produce syngas unit (DRY-REF) [44], direct synthesis of light alpha olefins via FTO unit (R1) [14], gaseous products compression unit (COMPR), water scrubbing and decarbonization unit (SEP3) [45], multistage cooling and separation unit (SEP4), olefins refinement unit (SEP5), fraction cutting and polymerization unit (SEP6) [46,47], alkanes separation unit (SEP7), alcohols refinement unit (SEP8), hydroformylation unit (SEP9) [48,49] etc.. The key operating parameters of equipment models are listed in Table 2. 2.1.1 CO2-rich natural gas dry reforming process (DRY-REF) The Aspen model built for CO2-rich natural gas dry reforming process is shown in Fig. 5 . The PENG-ROB state equation is selected as the local property method in this unit. The natural gas containing 39.5%mol of CO2 composition, is heated to 600℃ through a series of heat exchangers (E101 ~ E104) and is mixed with preheated oxygen, recycling CO2 flow before entering the dry reforming reactor (R101). The dry reforming reactor operates at 2.2 MPaG with 900℃~950℃ outlet temperature [8,50]. A kind of highly coking-resistant and active nickel-based catalyst is loaded in the fixed bed [51,52]. The conversion rate of CH4 and CO2 can reach higher than 96% and 40%, respectively. The content of (H2 + CO) in the syngas out of dry reforming reactor is 73.9% and the remaining content of CH4 is lower than 1% (shown in Table 1 ). Syngas out of the reactor will be cooled to 40℃ through subsequent heat exchangers and then enter a flashing tank (F101) for dehydration. The dry syngas will then go to MDEA unit for CO2 removal (F102) [53] and pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit [54] (F103) for hydrogen recovery. Ryield reactor models were used to simulate commercial MDEA decarbonization unit and PSA unit. The adjusted syngas out of PSA unit with a H2/CO molar ratio of 0.5 will be mostly used as FTO feedstock for LAO production and partially (no more than 1%) used for hydroformylation process with small part of recovered hydrogen. The main reactions in dry reforming unit are shown as follows: (1) CO 2 + CH 4 → 2 C O + 2 H 2 Δ H = 247.3 k J / m o l (2) C H 4 + 1 2 O 2 → C O + H 2 Δ H = - 35.6 k J / m o l (3) CH 4 + 2 O 2 → CO 2 + 2 H 2 O Δ H = - 880 k J / m o l (4) CO 2 + H 2 → C O + H 2 O Δ H = 41 k J / m o l 2.1.2 FTO process The FTO process has long offered a way of producing lower olefins directly from syngas. But the hydrocarbons out of FTO reactor typically follow the Anderson-Scholz-Flory (ASF) distribution which is characterized by a maximum C2-C4 hydrocarbon fraction of about 56.7% and a methane fraction of about 29.2%. However, an improved FTO process developed by our laboratory broke the ASF rule with high selectivity of low-carbon olefins production (constituting around 60.8% of the carbon products) but little methane (≤5%). The cobalt carbide quadrangular catalyst was used and loaded in a slurry bed. The H2/CO molar ratio of feedstock is 0.5 with operating pressure 0.5 MPa and temperature at 250 ~ 260 ℃ [12,14] (Table 3 ). Main reactions in FTO process include hydrocarbons and oxygenates synthesis reactions which are listed as Eqs. (5)–(8). Side reactions mainly include water–gas-shift and coking reactions which are listed as Eqs. (9),(10). The FTO reactor simulation is based on the experiment results reported by our laboratory, thus a Ryield reactor model is selected. Compositions of outlet hydrocarbons are shown in Table 2. (5) nCO + 2 n + 1 H 2 → H ( CH 2 ) n H + n H 2 O (6) O l e f i n s y n t h e s i s : n C O + 2 n H 2 → ( CH 2 ) n + n H 2 O (7) A l c o h o l s y n t h e s i s : n C O + 2 n H 2 → H ( CH 2 ) n O H + ( n - 1 ) H 2 O (8) A l d e h y d e s y n t h e s i s : n C O + ( 2 n - 1 ) H 2 → ( CH 2 ) n O + ( n - 1 ) H 2 O (9) W a t e r - g a s - s h i f t r e a c t i o n : C O + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2 (10) C o k i n g r e a c t i o n : 2 C O → C + CO 2 2.1.3 Olefins refinement unit (SEP5) Light hydrocarbons from flashing tank II and compression unit are separated into C5-C7 hydrocarbons (alkanes & olefins) and oxygenated chemicals (alcohols & aldehydes) within the same boiling point range (flow 7), C8-C12 hydrocarbons (alkanes & olefins) and oxygenated chemicals (alcohols & aldehydes) with in the same boiling point range (flow 5), and C13+ hydrocarbons (alkanes & olefins) and oxygenated chemicals (alcohols & aldehydes) with in the same boiling point range (flow 6) through distillation units (D501, D503) [55] (Fig. 6 ). Mixed material (flow 7) enters extraction tower (D502) where water is used as extractant to extract alcohols and aldehydes from light hydrocarbons. Then, the aqueous solution (flow 9) containing oxygenated chemicals is set into alcohol refinement unit (SEP8). C5-C7 hydrocarbons (flow 10) mixed with light hydrocarbons from multistage cooling and separation unit (SEP 4) are separated into C5 rich hydrocarbons (flow 13), C6 rich hydrocarbons (flow 15) and C7 rich hydrocarbons (flow 16) through distillation process (D504, D505) [56]. Then, they will be further refined and separated into pentene (flow 21), hexene (flow 28) and heptene (flow 35) as final products. The alkanes removed will then go to the alkane separation unit (SEP 7). 2.1.4 Multistage cooling and separation unit (SEP4) The purified gas (flow 14) obtained from decarbonization unit (SEP3) enters multistage cooling and separation unit (SEP 4)[57]. In the multi-stage cooling, condensation and flash separation process, the gas phase flow of each separation tank will enter the next separation tank after cooling and partial condensation, while the gas phase flow of the last separation tank, which mainly contains hydrogen and carbon monoxide, will be recycled to the FTO reactor (Fig. 7 ). The condensate at the bottom of each separation tank is sent to demethanizing tower (D402) except for the last separation tank. Sequential separation process which is widely applied in the industry, is adopted to separate alkane and olefin with corresponding carbon number. 2.1.5 Fraction cutting and polymerization unit (SEP6) Aspen model of fraction cutting and polymerization unit is shown in Fig. 8 . C8 ~ C12 hydrocarbons (alkanes & olefins) and oxygenated chemicals (alcohols & aldehydes) within the same boiling point range (flow 1) enters extraction tower (D601) where alcohol and water are used as extractant (flow 3) before going to extraction tower (D602) where water is used as extractant (flow 6). The refined C8 ~ C12 hydrocarbons (flow 8) enters olefin polymerization unit (R602) to produce PAO base oil after mixing with hydrocarbons with same carbon number (flow 31) from multistage cooling and separation unit (SEP 4) [58]. n-Hexadecane is used as anti-solvent (flow 10) in extraction and distillation units to separate oxygenated chemicals. 2.1.6 Alcohols refinement unit (SEP8) The aqueous solution containing aldehydes from the above-mentioned separation unit enters dehydrating tower (D801) to separate a large amount of water (flow 5), and then it enters membrane separation unit (F801) to separate the remaining water so that the residual moisture of flow 8 is less than 0.3% (Fig. 9 ). Then flow 8 enters the hydrogenation unit (R801) which hydrogenates the aldehyde to produce alcohol corresponding to the carbon number. The alcohol is further separated into C1 ~ C7 single-alcohol and plasticizer alcohol (C8 ~ C12) (flow 24) [59]and detergent alcohol (C13+) (flow 25) [60] by thermally coupled distillation towers. 2.1.7 Technology evaluation index To evaluate the technical feasibility of the integrated system for LAO production, carbon efficiency and energy efficiency were selected as key assessment factors. Carbon efficiency, defined in Eq. (11), refers to the ratio of carbon fixed in the product to the carbon in the feed material input [43]; energy efficiency, defined in Eq. (12), refers to the ratio of heat fixed in the product to all energy input of the system, including raw materials and utilities [61] (Table 4 ). (11) η C - E f f i c i e n c y = ∑ i f Product - i ∙ C Number - i ∑ j f Feed - j ∙ C Number - j (12) η E - E f f i c i e n c y = ∑ i m Product - i ∙ LHV product - i W utilities + ∑ j m Feed - j ∙ LHV feed - j where f Product - i and f Feed - j are the mole flow of i product and j feedstock, respectively; C Number - i and C Number - j are the number of carbon atoms contained in i product and j feedstock. In Eq. (12), m Product - i and m Feed - j are the mass flow of i product and j feedstock, respectively; LHV product - i and LHV feed - j are the low heating value of i product and j feedstock. W utilities is the net work equivalent input of electricity, steam, water and other utilities."
3,Process economic model,"2.2 Process economic model The scope of economic assessment refers to the whole LAO production system from CO2-rich NG dry reforming for syngas to products refinement. The capital investments of various process subsystems are identified and the annual production cost (PC) is comprised of annual capital cost (ACC), fixed cost (FC) and operating cost (OPC) [62,63]. The mass weighted production cost is also calculated based on the total annual production scale of this integrated system. Furthermore, the net present value (NPV) and its sensitivity analysis are also performed [64], because it is an essential indictor in investment planning to analyze the economic feasibility of a project. The plant is assumed to be newly constructed in China. The most important economic evaluation parameters are shown in Table 5. The following equations of (12)–(18) are used to calculate PC and NPV of the evaluated system. (13) NPV = ∑ t = 1 n R t ( 1 + i ) t where Rt is the value of net cash inflow minus outflows during the economic life of integrated chemical plant; i is the desired rate of return which is assumed 12%; t is the economic life of the evaluated plant which is assumed 20 years. (14) PC = A C C + F C + O P C The annual capital cost can be calculated by (15) ACC = R F × T P I (16) RF = i × i + 1 t / [ i + 1 t - 1 ] where ACC is the annual capital cost; RF is the annual capital recovery factor [65]; TPI is the total project capital invest; i represents the annual discount rate on loans and is assumed 7% [66]; and t represents the economic life of integrated chemical plant, which is assumed 20 years. In order to evaluate the total capital invest (TPI), the capacity factor model is applied as follows: (17) TPI s d = T P I r e f × ( S s d S r e f ) n where TPI s d and T P I r e f are the total capital invest of the designed project and referential similar project, respectively; S s d and S r e f are the size of the designed project and reference project, respectively and generally used main product scale as the indicator; n represents the scale coefficient and is set as 0.6 [62]; The fixed cost involves project management, equipment maintenance, and other general expenses. In this study, fixed cost (FC) is calculated as 5% of the total capital invest [67]. The operating cost (OPC) involves the cost of raw material and energy (MC) like CO2-rich offshore natural gas, fuel gas, oxygen etc., purchased utilities (UC) like electricity, steam, fresh water etc., labor (LC), and by-products (BC). The by-product costs are negative because they are sold at market price. (18) OPC = M C + U C + L C + B C Production capacity including hydrocarbons and oxygenates of the integrated system is assumed 50.76 × 104 ton/a. Table 6 shows the market prices of materials and utilities consumed in this LAO production system. And the prices of main products are also listed as the basis for internal rate of return (IRR). Price of CO2-rich offshore natural gas is lower than current commercial natural gas in China because of its higher content of CO2 and lower heat value (22.5 MJ/Nm3). Fresh water, electricity and steam prices are based on the industry purchasing prices in recent years [68]. Prices of high value added chemicals including alkanes, olefins and oxygenates are based on the retail prices in the last two years [69]. The mass weighted product price (MWPP) is defined in Eq. (18). (19) M W P P = ∑ i m i P i ∑ i m i where mi is the mass flow of i product and Pi is the market price of i product."
4,Result and discussion,
5,Material and energy results,"3.1 Material and energy results Fig. 3(b) shows the Aspen process model we built to calculate the mass and energy balance of CO2 rich NG dry reforming for LAO production system. The steam results (shown in supplemental information Table S1) of this integrated system is calculated by Aspen Plus, based on an annual output of 507,610 ton of hydrocarbon alcohols. The production system consumes 2.27 × 105 Nm3/hr of fresh CO2-rich NG which enters dry reforming unit after mixing with recycling CH4 (8.11 × 103 Nm3/hr) and part of recycling CO2 (11.16 ton/hr) from multistage cooling and separation units. The dry reforming outlet gas flow (3.69 × 105 Nm3/hr), with a H2/CO molar ratio of of 0.5, and less than 1.5% of CH4, is sent to FTO reactor (R1) to produce mixture containing alkene, alkane, alcohol, aldehyde etc. The FTO product distribution is mainly based on laboratory data, and the CO single pass conversion rate is 35.8%. After heat exchange, flashing and compression, the FTO product is further separated into gas phase (1.25 × 103 ton/hr), light hydrocarbon (11.14 ton/hr) and heavy hydrocarbon (3.01 ton/hr). The gas phase then enters decarburization separation unit to remove CO2 (191.44 ton/hr) and oxygen compound (5.87 ton/hr) before going to the multi-stage condensation and separation unit to separate low-carbon monomer olefin (C1=~C4=) and final product alkane (C1-~C4-). The other hydrocarbon mixture from this unit is separated into C5 ~ C7 (15.05 ton/hr) and C8+ (2.4 ton/hr) by distillation range. Then C5 ~ C7 and C8+ enter olefin refining and fraction cutting and polymerization units, respectively. The raw material of the olefin refining unit comes from light hydrocarbon intermediate products (26.19 ton/hr) from the by-product of the system, and the final product of the olefin refining unit is C5 ~ C7 monomer olefin (14.47 ton/hr), while the other alkane products separated enter to alkane refining unit. The whole system also integrates PAO base oil production unit and hydroformylation unit to produce higher alcohol. Table 7 presents the output of the integrated system's final products, including 2.01 × 105 ton/a of monomer alkane products, 3.15 × 105 ton/a of monomer olefin products, and 6.95 × 104 ton/a of monomer alcohol products. In addition, the system produces 3.62 × 104 ton/a of high value-added PAO base oil products that are urgently needed in the market. High carbon alcohols including plasticizer alcohol (1.16 × 104 ton/a) and detergent alcohol (2.91 × 104 ton/a) are also produced to mitigate the situation of total dependence on imports in China. In terms of CO2 emission, after deduction of the recycling CO2, the synthesis system produces 1.44 × 106 ton/a of CO2 due to water-shift conversion in the FTO reactor. However, the total CO2 consumption in the syngas production process is 1.41 × 106 ton/a since CO2-rich natural gas is used as feedstock of the integrated system, and the mole fraction of CO2 in the raw material is 39.39%. As a result, the entire system emits only 3.19 × 104 ton/a of CO2 and the unit carbon emission is equivalent to 0.06 ton-CO2/ton-hydrocarbon, which is 98% lower than that of conventional coal-based F-T system which is 4.92 ton CO2 per ton product. According to Aspen's material balance and energy balance results, the carbon efficiency and energy efficiency of the integrated system are calculated. As shown in Fig. 10 , the carbon efficiency of the system is 60.8%, which is 90.8% higher than that of the conventional coal-based FT system (32.6%); the energy efficiency is 35.44%, which is equivalent to the conventional coal-based FT system and the main reason is that the system produces high value-added LAO products and high-carbon alcohol products, so the downstream separation, purification and refining processes are complex, resulting in high energy consumption, of which the energy consumed by utilities (electricity/steam) accounts for 43.28%."
6,Economic analysis results,"3.2 Economic analysis results 3.2.1 Production cost and NPV results The capital investment of this integrated system is 7.2 billion RMB, in which the equipment cost accounts for 56.7% and the auxiliary facilities account for 24.2% (Table 8 ). 59.2% of equipment capital investment comes from syngas production and conversion system including CO2-rich natural gas dry reforming, FTO units. Based on the results of material and energy balance, market price of raw materials and utilities used in the system, and investment data etc., the average production cost per ton product is calculated to be 8839 RMB/ton (Table 9 ), of which the operating cost (OPC) accounts for 80%, the annual capital cost and fixed cost account for 13% and 7%, respectively (Fig. 11 ). Raw material consumption (NG) accounts for 52.92% of the total operating cost due to the high CO2 content in offshore natural gas; the cost of utilities (electricity & steam) accounts for 46.99% of the total operating costs because the separation process of downstream products is complex, in which the separation and refining of monomeric alkanes, olefins and alcohols consumes a large amount of steam and electricity. Additionally, in the syngas production unit, the by-product hydrogen produced through PSA purification process is sold at the market price, which reduces the production cost by 834 RMB/ton. Gas-to-liquids (GTL) is also an alternative solution for natural gas to produce high value-added products especially in gas resources rich countries. Shell Pearl GTL plant in Qatar produces 120,000 barrels liquid products per day, of which 70% are diesel fuels and 30% are petrochemical feedstocks [71,72]. With the feedstock requiring 9.85 MMBtu per barrel of output, and considering the NG price varying from $2/MMBtu to $6/MMBtu in Qatar, the levelized cost of liquids ranges from $62.1/bbl to $101.5/bbl [73]. Given that the current average price of diesel and petrochemical feedstock is $82.6/bbl and $193.9/bbl respectively, the break-even NG price is $6.32/MMBtu at 12% desired rate of return, which is available in Qatar but still lower than the NG price ($6.73/MMBtu) used in our case located in China. 3.2.2 Sensitivity analysis Based on the production capacity and mass weighted product price (11264 RMB/ton) shown in Table 8, considering 12% of desired rate of return, the net present value (NPV) of the integrated LAO production system is positive and much higher than zero, indicating that the production system is fairly risk-resistant and economically feasible. In addition, the effect of NG price on the system production cost is analyzed (Fig. 12 ). The results show that for every 0.2 RMB /Nm3 increase in NG price, the production cost of the system increases by 718 RMB /ton. Moreover, the sensitivity of natural gas price and MWPP on the system’s NPV is also analyzed. Under the present mass weighted product price, when the NG price is higher than 1095.2 RMB /1000Nm3, the system’s NPV will start to be negative. Considering the range of natural gas price is 0.5 ~ 2 RMB/Nm3, the mass weighted product price should range from 9127 to 14,513 RMB/ton to reach the positive NPV. 3.2.3 Economic performance comparison of various olefins production routes Based on 50.76 × 104 ton/a of olefins production capacity, the economic performance of conventional oil to light olefins (OTO), coal to light olefins via methanol (CTO) and the offshore CO2-rich natural gas to linear alpha olefins via F-T technology (NGFTO) was analyzed [33,74,75]. Production costs of olefins (PC) and net present value (NPV) of various routes are selected as economic comparison indexes. The main parameters of economic comparison analysis are listed in Table 4. Materials input &output as well as capital investment of CTO and OTO can be found in Table S2 of supplemental information. The production cost of NGFTO system is 32.6% and 57.6% higher compared with that of CTO and OTO routes, because the complex downstream products refinement processes of NGFTO system result in high utilities consumption (Fig. 13 ). The NPV value of NGFTO, however, is much higher and more positive than that of CTO and OTO routes which are both negative. The main reason lies in that the MWPP of NGFTO (11264 RMB/ton) is 70.8% and 74% higher than that of CTO (6594 RMB/ton) and OTO (6473 RMB/ton) routes, respectively. Nevertheless, the capital invests of NGFTO is 43.4% lower than that of CTO route. Furthermore, sensitivities of feedstock prices on PC and NPV of various olefins production routes were analyzed. The NPV of CTO and OTO routes will be positive if the coal and petroleum prices decrease by 30% and 21.7%, respectively. The NPV and olefins production cost of OTO route are more sensitive on feedstock price because the petroleum cost occupies more than 75% of total cost."
7,Conclusion,"In order to avoid the high carbon emissions and energy loss caused by decarburization in commercial NG production while utilizing CO2-rich NG in the South China Sea, this paper designs a CO2-rich NG dry reforming integrated with FTO technology to produce high value-added LAO products, which provides a new route for direct, efficient and high-value utilization of CO2-rich NG. The material and energy balance of the integrated system is calculated via Aspen plus process modeling, based on which the whole system is evaluated by carbon efficiency, energy efficiency and direct carbon emissions. The results show that the net CO2 emission of this system is only 0.06 ton-CO2/ton-product after deducting the CO2 utilized by the integrated system; the carbon efficiency of the system is 62.2%, which is 90.8% higher than that of the conventional coal-based FT system; the energy efficiency (35.4%) is lower to that of the conventional coal-based FT system and this is mainly because the system produces high value-added LAO products and high-carbon alcohol products, so the downstream separation, purification and refining processes are complex, resulting in high energy consumption, 43.3% of which is consumed by utilities (electricity/steam). Meanwhile, the economic performance of the system is evaluated by production cost and NPV. The results show that the average production cost per ton product is 8839 RMB/ton, 80% of which is operating cost (OPC). In term of NPV, under the current price of raw material and product, considering 12% of desired rate of return, the system's NPV is positive and much higher than zero, indicating that the production system has high risk-resistance and economic feasibility."
