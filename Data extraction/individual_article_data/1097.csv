0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is in the spotlight as a versatile energy carrier because it is a carbon-free energy source with a high mass-specific energy density of 33.3 kWh/kgH2 (lower heating value) that does not emit pollutants when reacting with oxygen to convert its chemical energy into other forms [1]. Hydrogen-related industries estimate the hydrogen demand potential in the US to reach 20–63 million metric tons per year (MMT/yr) by 2050, approximately two- to six-fold larger than that reported in 2015 (10 MMT/yr) [2]. Hydrogen is also expected to supply 14% of the US final energy demand by 2050 if policy, capital, and R&D supports are actively provided at the government level [2]. Other countries, including Europe and the UK, South Korea, Japan, and China, are also predicting similar hydrogen energy growths by 2050 (24%, 20%, 13%, and 10% of the final energy demand, respectively) [3–6]. The efficient production of hydrogen is key to realizing hydrogen economy. The Hydrogen Council estimates that hydrogen energy will meet ∼ 15% of the global energy demand by 2030 if the hydrogen production cost drops to $1.80/kgH2 [7]. Currently, majority of the hydrogen is produced from natural gas through steam methane reforming (SMR) [8]. This process is an important near-term hydrogen production technology owing to its low hydrogen production cost (<$1.5/kgH2 in 2016) and high energy efficiency (70–80%) [9]. However, since SMR releases carbon as carbon dioxide (7 kgCO2/kgH2), it must be combined with carbon capture, storage, and utilization to reduce carbon emissions [10]. From a long-term perspective, the development of hydrogen production technologies with zero carbon emissions is essential. Water electrolysis (WE), which produces hydrogen from water, is currently attracting significant attention as a sustainable method for producing hydrogen without carbon emissions, assuming that it is electrically powered by other renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power [11,12]. Depending on the operating temperature and electrolyte used, practical WE is classified into four types: alkaline WE, anion exchange membrane WE (AEMWE), proton exchange membrane WE (PEMWE), and solid oxide WE [13–15]. Among them, AEMWE and PEMWE are efficient methods of producing hydrogen from alkaline and acidic media, respectively, at relatively low operating temperatures. Both employ thin solid polymer membranes as electrolytes, attaining high energy efficiency (∼80%), high hydrogen purity (>99.99%), and device compactness [11,15,16]. These characteristics are advantageous for on-site hydrogen production that can respond immediately to hydrogen demand. Although there are slight differences in the technology maturity of AEMWE and PEMWE, both are attracting significant attention as the next-generation hydrogen production technologies. These technologies have long been advancing through extensive research; however, their practical application is still facing cost performance issues, and much effort is being devoted to making them more cost-effective [17]."
1,AEMWE,"1.1 AEMWE An alkaline water electrolyzer comprises two electrodes (cathode and anode) separated by a diaphragm in a liquid alkaline electrolyte (e.g., 25–30 wt% KOH), as shown in Fig. 1 a. The cathodic and anodic electrochemical reactions are: (1) Cathode-HER (hydrogen evolution reaction): 2H2O + 2e− → H2 + 2OH− (2) Anode-OER (oxygen evolution reaction): 2OH− → 1/2O2 + H2O + 2e− (3) Overall: H2O → H2 + 1/2O2 The diaphragm serves to separate the hydrogen and oxygen gases produced at the cathode and anode, respectively, and selectively permeates water molecules and hydroxide ions. The advantages of this technology are its low dependence on precious metal catalysts, long-term stability, and ease of handling. Moreover, alkaline WE is a fairly mature hydrogen production technology ready for commercial use. However, the typical alkaline water electrolyzer has some limitations, including its high air sensitivity, whereby the hydroxide ions in the concentrated KOH electrolyte tend to react with CO2 in air to form K2CO3 [18]. This reaction reduces the concentration of hydroxide ions and reactants for the anodic reaction, and forms K2CO3 precipitates that clog the diaphragm pores. Additionally, CO2 is dissolved in the electrolyte, thereby lowering its pH. Another disadvantage is the low maximum operating current density, which is caused by the high ohmic losses in the liquid electrolyte and diaphragm [19]. Cross-diffusion of the product gases through the diaphragm also poses a problem, risking the formation of flammable hydrogen and oxygen gas mixtures and lowering the hydrogen purity [20]. The inability to operate at high pressure is another disadvantage, whereby, a high operating pressure is beneficial for minimizing ohmic loss from gas bubbles and for compressing and storing hydrogen [12]. AEMWE has received much attention in recent years because it can improve these disadvantages while displaying the advantages of conventional alkaline WE. AEMWE uses a polymeric anion-conducting membrane, comprising a cross-linked polymer backbone and positively charged functional groups such as quaternary ammonium ions, instead of a diaphragm [21]. This membrane is called an anion exchange membrane (AEM). Fig. 1b illustrates the typical configuration of an electrolyzer for AEMWE: Water at the cathode side is electrochemically reduced to form hydrogen gas and hydroxide ions (Eq. (1)). The resulting hydroxide ions migrate through the AEM to the anode side and are electrochemically oxidized to form oxygen gas and water (Eq. (2)). Thus, using an AEM instead of a porous diaphragm increases the hydrogen discharge pressure in the cathode and reduces ohmic losses by minimizing the gap between the two electrodes [22]. Currently, this gap is < 1 mm, and this configuration is called a zero-gap configuration [23]. Cross-diffusion of the product gases can also be reduced by using an AEM; however, it depends on the thickness and properties of the membrane. Furthermore, since the AEM is an electrolyte, it eliminates the need for a highly concentrated KOH solution [24]. Despite these advantages, AEMWE still lacks membrane and catalyst stability, cell cost savings, and voltage efficiency, which are some issues that can be significantly improved by studies actively involving AEMWE."
2,PEMWE,"1.2 PEMWE PEMWE is a technology designed to overcome the disadvantages of conventional alkaline WE and has >10 years of history than AEMWE [25–27]. The typical configuration of an electrolyzer for PEMWE (Fig. 1c) is similar to that of an AEM water electrolyzer, except that its electrolyte is a proton exchange membrane (PEM), a polymeric proton-conducting membrane with a cross-linked polymer backbone and negatively charged functional groups such as sulfonate ions [28]. However, the electrochemical reactions at the cathode and anode differ from those in AEMWE: (4) Cathode-HER: 2H+ +2e− → H2 (5) Anode-OER: H2O → 2H+ + 1/2O2 + 2e− (6) Overall: H2O → H2 + 1/2O2 In this case, water is supplied to the anode and dissociates to produce protons and oxygen gas (Eq. (5)). The protons then travel through the PEM to the cathode side and are electrochemically reduced to hydrogen gas (Eq. (4)). The overall reaction (Eq. (6)) is the same as that of AEMWE; however, PEMWE generally achieves a higher maximum current density at the same cell voltage, resulting in higher voltage efficiency [26]. High-purity hydrogen (>99.99 vol%) is another advantage of PEMWE [11]. Additionally, similar to AEMWE, PEM water electrolyzers can operate at high pressure on the cathode side. Finally, although PEMWE is in a more mature technology stage than AEMWE, it is struggling with high cost issues [17], mainly related to the use of corrosion-resistant materials that can withstand its acidic and corrosive environment. The PEM water electrolyzer components, such as the catalysts, porous transport layers (PTLs), and bipolar plates, all require high corrosion resistance; however, few materials meet this requirement. Thus, catalysts are usually based on platinum group metals (Pt, Ru, and Ir) [29,30], while PTLs and bipolar plates are mostly made of Ti, stainless steel, and graphite [26]."
3,HER catalysts for low-temperature WE,"1.3 HER catalysts for low-temperature WE The operating cell voltage (Vc) required for WE under standard conditions (25 °C, 1 atm) is (7) Vc = 1.48 V + iR + ηc + ηa where 1.48 V is the thermo-neutral cell voltage [13], defined as the minimum cell voltage required for driving the cell reaction at constant temperature; iR is the voltage loss due to ohmic resistance that originates from the cell components (e.g., electrolyte and contact resistances); ηc and ηa are the overpotentials for HER and OER, respectively. For energy efficient WE, Vc must be reduced: iR can be minimized by optimizing the electrolytic cell design and reducing the electric/ionic resistances of the components, while ηc and ηa can be reduced by introducing an appropriate catalyst (decreasing activation overpotential) and enhancing mass transfer of the reactants and products (decreasing concentration overpotential). Because the activation overpotential decreases with increasing catalytic activity, many researchers are focusing on the development of active HER and OER catalysts. However, for practical WE, the catalyst stability, cost, and catalyst material availability should also be considered when designing a catalyst. Catalysts based on precious metals (Pt, Ru, and Ir) generally show high HER and OER activities and stabilities, thereby ensuring high WE performances for certain lifetimes. However, precious metals are unsuitable for the cost reduction and sustainability of the hydrogen production by WE because their high cost and limited reserves may impede large-scale implementation of WE. In fact, the catalyst is a minor cost item in present commercial PEM water electrolyzers. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has estimated that precious metal catalysts currently account for <10% of the cost of a 1 MW PEM water electrolyzer stack [31]. However, once PEMWE technology becomes widespread, this reliance on precious metals will be a serious bottleneck. The manufacturing cost per system is typically lower with higher production volumes within the scope of economies of scale. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has estimated that the higher the annual production rate (APR), the lower the cost of the PEM electrolyzer stack [32]. The stack cost becomes more dependent on the cost of catalyst-coated membranes (CCMs) in which precious metal catalysts accounts for 13–46%, as the APR increases. For example, for a 1 MW PEM water electrolyzer stack, the portion of CCM cost increases from about 37% to 50% as the APR increases from 10 to 1,000 unit/yr. Moreover, given the rising precious metal costs due to limited supply and growing demand, the catalyst cost is expected to have a more decisive impact on the stack cost in the near future. Cost analysis of AEM water electrolyzers is still challenging as few companies have commercialized them. However, a similar situation is expected in AEM water electrolyzers. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop non-precious catalysts comprising earth-abundant elements for both HER and OER. For HER, two mechanisms are adopted: Volmer-Tafel and Volmer-Heyrovsky depending on the catalyst [33]. Under acidic conditions, the Volmer reaction comprises the electrochemical reduction of a proton to an adsorbed hydrogen atom (Had), which is then desorbed via chemical (Tafel) or electrochemical (Heyrovsky) reaction. (8) Volmer: H+ + e− → Had (9) Tafel: Had + Had → H2 (10) Heyrovsky: Had + H+ + e− → H2 Under alkaline conditions, a water molecule is electrochemically reduced to produce an Had and hydroxide ion (Volmer reaction). Subsequently, the Had combines with another adjacent Had (Tafel reaction) or is electrochemically reduced by a water molecule to a hydrogen molecule and hydroxide ion (Heyrovsky reaction). (11) Volmer: H2O + e− → Had + OH− (12) Tafel: Had + Had → H2 (13) Heyrovsky: Had + H2O + e− → H2 + OH− Because of these differences, the development of acidic and alkaline HER catalysts must be approached from different perspectives. Under acidic conditions, the adsorption energy of the hydrogen atom on the catalyst surface is a decisive factor that determines the catalytic activity. Applying Sabatier’s principle to HER, an ideal catalyst must bind strongly enough to the hydrogen atoms in the Volmer reaction, but not too strongly to produce hydrogen molecules (H2) in the Tafel or Heyrovsky reactions, which involve hydrogen atom desorption. Indeed, the hydrogen binding energy is generally a good physical descriptor for acidic HER [34,35], giving a volcano-shaped relationship between the hydrogen binding energy and catalytic activity (exchange current density) (Fig. 2 a) [35]. A similar relationship applies to alkaline HER (Fig. 2b) [36]. However, in alkaline HER, three species (water molecules, adsorbed hydrogen atoms, and hydroxide ions) are involved, indicating that the adsorption of a hydrogen atom, water molecule dissociation, and hydroxide ion desorption should be optimized when developing alkaline HER catalysts [34,37]. The key to reducing the catalyst cost is to increase the activity and stability of the catalyst for HER, while reducing the use of Pt. The development of Pt-based catalysts alloyed with earth-abundant transition metals is one option [38]; however, the ultimate goal should be to develop an HER catalyst composed only of earth-abundant elements. This review introduces the recent developments in non-precious HER catalysts for polymer electrolyte WE, focusing on catalysts that have been evaluated at the zero-gap full-cell level. Most reported catalysts are often limited to evaluation at the half-cell level, owing to the complexities of full-cell testing methods and catalyst preparation. However, their verification in full-cells is essential for practical application because of features that cannot be evaluated in half-cells, such as triple-phase boundary formation, ohmic and mass transfer resistances in the electrodes of the full-cell. To this end, herein, we introduce the results of frontier research showing the performance of full-cells using non-precious HER catalysts and discuss the issues and solutions for applying non-precious HER catalysts to full-cells."
4,Test protocol for the performance of HER catalysts,
5,Half-cells,"2.1 Half-cells Generally, the performance of an HER catalyst is electrochemically evaluated by half-cell and full-cell systems. The half-cell (three-electrode) system is advantageous because it is simple to configure and focuses only on the half-cell reaction occurring at the working electrode. Catalysts are typically applied to the working electrode in two ways, depending on their type. Particulate catalysts are applied to the electrochemically inert electrode (e.g., glassy carbon) as a slurry comprising a mixture of the catalyst, ionomers, and solvents such as ethanol and isopropyl alcohol. After loading the slurry on the electrode, drying is necessary prior to electrochemical measurement to fix the catalyst layer on the electrode surface. Conversely, some catalysts are formed directly on a substrate. In this case, the substrate is directly used as the working electrode without a separate catalyst fixation process. A typical example is electrodeposition of the catalyst on a glassy carbon electrode or PTL. The choice of counter electrode is highly important when configuring a half-cell system. The Pt counter electrode, which is often used in half-cells, is dissolved in small amounts during OER in the catalyst test. The dissolved Pt ions are then redeposited on the working electrode by the applied HER potential. This makes the performance test of non-precious HER catalysts inaccurate [39]. The overall catalytic activity is generally determined from the HER polarization curves in which the HER current increases exponentially with the increasing overpotential (Fig. 3 a). The overpotential at a certain current density is a representative measure of the catalytic activity. Although, there is no standardized value for the current density to address the activity, a value of 10 mA/cmgeo 2 is usually adopted, corresponding to the 12.3% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of solar water splitting [29,40]. The catalytic activity is also determined by the onset potential, which is the potential at which the reaction starts. As with the overpotential, the lower onset potential implies the higher catalytic activity. Notably, a low onset potential does not always guarantee low overpotential (Fig. 3a). The onset potential is only an indicator of how thermodynamically favorable the HER is on the catalyst. The HER kinetics is usually related to the current density, which is proportional to the number of active sites, and the overpotential is a combination of these two factors. The Tafel plot also provides information on the catalytic activity through the Tafel slope and exchange current density (Fig. 3b). In the Tafel plot, the overpotential (η) is plotted against the logarithm of the current density (j), and part of the Tafel plot shows a linear relationship according to the Tafel equation [41]. Theoretically, a Tafel slope of 120 mV/dec is obtained when the Volmer step is the rate determining step (RDS). If the Heyrovsky or Tafel step is the RDS, then a Tafel slope of 40 or 30 mV/dec, respectively, is observed [41,42]. The exchange current density (j0 ) is the current density at an equilibrium potential (η = 0), indicating the spontaneous reaction rate of an electrochemical reaction. Thus, the exchange current density is related to the intrinsic catalytic activity, and is obtained by extrapolating from the Tafel plot. Generally good catalysts have a low Tafel slope and high exchange current density. The stability of an HER catalyst is characterized in two ways: The first is to measure the change in HER-related current at a constant applied potential over a long period. Usually, the applied potential is set to a value capable of inducing a current density ≥ 10 mA/cm2. In some cases, the change in potential at constant current density (∼10 mA/cm2) is observed for stability testing. The second method is to perform repetitive potential cycles within the range of potentials in which HER occurs. Testing HER catalysts in a half-cell system allows the evaluation of the catalytic activity and stability and the elucidation of HER mechanisms. However, in actual polymer electrolyte WE (AEMWE and PEMWE), HER is also affected by factors other than the catalytic activity and stability. Catalysts are applied in higher amounts in polymer electrolyte WE than in half-cell tests. Furthermore, compared to half-cell tests generally performed at a level of tens of mA/cm2 owing to the limited proton supplement in aqueous electrolyte, the polymer electrolyte WE operates at current densities of several A/cm2 with a massive water supplement. These extended conditions additionally require in-depth consideration of the ohmic and mass transfer losses through the catalyst [43,44]. The formation of uniform triple-phase boundaries, where electron/proton conductors, catalysts, and reactant/product pathways meet, also becomes an important factor [45,46]. For these reasons, the results of the half-cell test may not be reflected in the actual polymer electrolyte WE. Therefore, to accurately evaluate the catalytic performance, it is necessary to evaluate it at the full-cell level wherein the actual WE is performed."
6,Full-cells,"2.2 Full-cells Full-cell systems differ significantly from half-cell systems, wherein the cathodic and anodic reactions must be considered simultaneously. When evaluating an HER catalyst in a full-cell system, it is important to set the system conditions so that the limitation of HER kinetics by that of OER can be minimized. The bath-type cell comprises two electrodes immersed in liquid electrolytes, separated by a membrane (e.g., solid polymer electrolyte) or diaphragm (Fig. 1a). The advantage of this full-cell type is that it is easy to configure. However, the electrolysis efficiency is low due to the high ohmic resistance. In a zero-gap full-cell (Fig. 3c), the gap between the anode and cathode is minimized using a thin (<1 mm) membrane to reduce the electrolyte ohmic resistance, thereby improving the electrolysis efficiency. The compactness of the zero-gap full-cell also enables efficient cell stacking for large-capacity electrolyzers. Although the configuration may vary slightly, a zero-gap full-cell is typically composed of a central membrane, catalyst layers where electrochemical reactions take place, PTLs that facilitate uniform reactant distribution over the catalyst layer, and bipolar (separator) plates with flow channels for reactant/product transport. Generally, a PTL is also used as the current collector (distributer), and the catalyst layer and PTL are collectively referred to as the electrode (anode/cathode). AEM and PEM water electrolyzers are zero-gap full-cells. In a PEM water electrolyzer (Fig. 1c), water molecules supplied to the anode side are oxidized (Eq. (5)) to form oxygen gas, protons, and electrons. The product oxygen gas exits the cell through the flow channel along with any unreacted water. Hydrogen gas is formed on the cathode by the reduction of the protons passing through the PEM and escapes out of the cell. AEM electrolyzers have a similar fluid flow, except that the water can also be supplied to the cathode side (Fig. 1b). However, the materials for the catalysts, PTLs, and bipolar plates are different. Unlike AEM water electrolyzers, for PEM water electrolyzers operating under acidic conditions the corrosion resistance of the materials must be considered. Thus, the catalyst components usually comprise precious metals such as Pt, Ru, and Ir. Moreover, most PTLs and bipolar plates for PEM water electrolyzers are made of Ti or stainless steel, which withstand acidic and corrosive conditions. Particularly on the anode side where OER occurs, more careful material selection is required because of extreme oxidizing conditions with highly positive potential. For instance, carbon-based materials are only used on the cathode side because they are unstable under the harsh conditions of the anode side [47,48]. AEM water electrolyzers have relatively more room for material choices than PEM water electrolyzers, and carbon-based materials and non-precious metals can be used for both the anode and cathode sides. This makes AEM water electrolyzers more cost-effective than PEM water electrolyzers. A core technology common to both electrolyzers is to fabricate a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) comprising a cathode, anode, and membrane (Fig. 3c). MEA is fabricated by sandwiching a membrane between the porous cathode and anode, to facilitate the inflow/outflow of the reactants/products. Catalysts are applied to the MEA by CCM and catalyst-coated substrate (CCS) methods [49,50]. In the CCM method, the cathode and anode catalysts are coated (e.g., spraying and decal transfer) on each side of the membrane [51,52], while in the CCS method the catalyst is directly coated on the PTLs. The former method is usually preferred for particulate catalysts as it shows better membrane/catalyst interfacial contact than the latter method [52], which results in higher catalyst utilization efficiency. The CCS method is advantageous for mass production because the process is relatively simple; however, it shows limited membrane/catalyst interfacial contact. Although hot-pressing improves the interfacial contact, the intense heat and pressure applied during the process may damage the MEA structure [53]. The nature of the catalyst synthesis also determines how the MEA is fabricated. For example, electrodeposited catalysts are generally applied to an MEA by the CCS method because they are formed directly on the conductive PTL [54,55]. The as-fabricated MEA is combined with other cell components, such as the bipolar plates, to form a zero-gap full-cell. The full-cell performance is typically evaluated by scanning the cell voltage or current at 40–90 °C. Fig. 3d shows the schematic of a typical polarization curve obtained in a full-cell. The curve is divided into three regions (activation, ohmic, and concentration polarizations), depending on the relationship between the current density and cell voltage. The activation and concentration polarizations, where the cell voltage rapidly increases, are the regions dominated by catalytic activity and mass transfer, respectively. The ohmic polarization, in which the current density and cell voltage show a linear relationship, is a region mainly affected by the ohmic resistance of the cell. Generally, good performing water electrolyzers achieve high current densities at low cell voltages. Thus, the catalyst activity, mass transfer of reactants/products and overall cell conductivity should be improved. There are no absolute indicators for evaluating the full-cell performance; however, many studies have used the current density, which can be obtained at cell voltages approximating 2 V, as a performance indicator. Alternatively, cell voltages that can be obtained at a specific current density are also often used. The full-cell stability is evaluated by measuring cell current (or voltage) changes at a specific cell voltage (or current) for a long period. This is similar to the stability test in a half-cell system but is typically performed at a much higher current density of at least hundreds of mA/cm2. Compared to the half-cells, the full-cells are structurally more complex and have more testing condition parameters. In the half-cell test, only the catalytic activity is evaluated, and the test conditions are controlled by a few parameters, such as the electrolyte type and test temperature. In contrast, the catalytic activity, overall cell conductivity, and mass transfer have a complex effect on the evaluation of the catalyst performance of a full-cell system. These factors are affected by the material properties of the cell components (e.g., catalytic activity, electronic/ionic conductivity, and porosity), MEA fabrication methods, cell assembly conditions (e.g., compression pressure), and cell operating conditions (e.g., fluid flow rate, temperature, and pressure). Thus, in a full-cell, these parameters must be optimized individually for the applied catalyst, and in the process, the results may differ from those of the half-cell test [56]. There is no standardized test protocol for the HER catalyst performance in a full-cell system. MEA fabrication methods vary slightly by catalyst type and research group, and other cell components, such as PTLs, membranes, and bipolar plates, also differ from group to group. These differences hinder the equal comparison of the reported absolute performances of HER catalysts in full-cells."
7,Non-precious HER catalysts for zero-gap cell applications,"Many research groups are developing more active and stable non-precious HER catalysts to reduce the cost of the electrolyzers. However, the activity and stability of most catalysts are tested at the half-cell level, and the test conditions are different for each group, making objective comparison difficult. McCrory et al. tested previously reported non-precious catalysts under identical conditions, allowing objective comparison [40]. However, it is still necessary to ensure that the performance of these catalysts is well reflected in an actual full-cell. Particularly, for non-precious HER catalysts, since the mass-specific activity is lower than that for precious HER catalysts, a full-cell test requires large catalyst loadings, which significantly increases the ohmic and mass transfer resistances. Therefore, catalyst optimization at the full-cell level is strongly recommended. Section 3.1 briefly introduces non-precious HER catalyst materials developed in the half-cell stage, while Section 3.2 focuses on the catalysts tested at the full-cell level."
8,Candidate materials developed from the half-cell test,"3.1 Candidate materials developed from the half-cell test 3.1.1 HER catalysts for alkaline WE Among the various types of non-precious HER catalysts for alkaline WE, Ni-based alloys are the most studied. Pure Ni is a commercially available representative non-precious HER catalyst material (e.g., Ni/CeO2-La2O3/C; Acta 4030, Acta SpA) [57]. Recently, to further improve the performance of pure Ni catalysts, studies have been conducted to control the surface morphology or change the support material [58,59]. Ni can also be alloyed with other transition metals, such as Co, Cu, Mo, and Fe [60,61]. These hetero-atoms tune the electronic configuration of the Ni atom, making it more favorable for HER. Raj et al. extensively investigated the catalytic activity of Ni-based alloys toward HER, reporting that Mo-containing Ni-based alloys are strong candidates as Pt alternatives [62–64]. This has facilitated research on NiMo alloys for alkaline HER. Various factors, such as high surface area by Mo dissolution, favorable reaction energetics by NiMo alloy formation, and hydrogen trapping and sink functions of Mo, have been proposed to explain the high activity of NiMo [65–67]. These factors assume that Ni is the main active site, while Mo plays a role in aiding Ni catalysis. However, it has been recently reported that the oxidized Mo species on the NiMo surface serve as the main active sites for HER, whereas Ni assists Mo catalysis [68]. Among the known catalysts comprising NiMo alloys, MoNi4 supported by MoO2 cuboids on Ni foam (MoNi4/MoO2@Ni) displays the highest activity, with an overpotential of 15 mV at 10 mA/cm2 on a half-cell basis [69]. Together with Ni, Co and Fe are promising candidate materials for alkaline HER catalysis. However, pure Co does not show as high HER activity as pure Ni under alkaline conditions, owing to its slow water dissociation kinetics [70]. One way to promote the water dissociation kinetics is to alloy Co with Mo or Ni [71,72]. Chen et al. reported Co3Mo alloy nanoparticles formed on MoO3 nanosheets with a high HER activity of 68 mV at 10 mA/cm2 [71]. Pure Fe is an inexpensive material but has poor catalytic activity toward HER [73], while stainless steel (FeCr alloy) is a representative material of Fe-based alloys for HER in alkaline media. Various attempts, including surface modification and doping with active species, to increase the activity of stainless steel have afforded unsatisfactory HER activity [74–76]. Therefore, Fe was alloyed with different transition metals, such as Mo, Ni, and Co [77–79]. Cabello et al. reported an FeCo alloy catalyst with a 1:1 Fe-to-Co content, prepared by microwave-assisted electrochemical deposition [79], which showed an onset potential of 145 mV for HER under alkaline conditions. Transition-metal-based carbides and nitrides have emerged as promising HER catalyst materials because of their favorable physical and chemical properties for HER catalysis [80]. Ni-based carbides and nitrides are commonly studied in ternary systems using Co, Fe, or Mo, or in hybrid systems in which two or more catalytic materials are mixed. For example, Chen et al. recently reported a catalyst in which N atoms are doped into a NiMo alloy, and this catalyst performed high enough to show an overpotential of 11 mV at 10 mA/cm2 under alkaline conditions [81]. Song et al. also developed a highly active Ni3N/Ni hybrid catalyst (12 mV at 10 mA/cm2) by interface engineering of Ni3N and Ni [82]. In addition to Ni, various nitride and carbide catalysts based on Co, Mo, or W, etc. have also been reported [80]. Transition-metal-based chalcogenides, such as sulfides and selenides, are also considered promising candidates, owing to their low cost and simple preparation method [83]. Compared to the original metals, these materials exhibit superior HER performances because of their negatively polarized chalcogen anions, which aid proton adsorption and lower the HER overpotential [84,85]. However, sulfides and selenides solely made of Ni generally have poor catalyst performances compared to other Ni-based materials [86]. Therefore, they are often combined with other metals or metal-based materials [87–89]. Compared to Ni-based sulfides, Ni-based selenides generally exhibit slightly higher catalytic performances [83,90]. For example, an electrodeposited Co-doped NiSe2 film exhibited an overpotential of 64 mV at 10 mA/cm2 [91]. Mo- and Co-based sulfides have also been studied, of which MoS2 is highly investigated, owing to its high HER activity and stability under acidic conditions [29]. However, these materials generally do not work better under alkaline than acidic conditions. This performance can be improved by adding a secondary transition metal such as Co, Ni, or Fe [92–94]. Recently, Tang et al. developed a Co-doped MoS2 nanocluster catalyst with an overpotential of 84 mV at 10 mA/cm2 [92]. Selenides based on Co or Mo have also been investigated using similar methods [95,96]. Transition-metal-based phosphides have also been considered as HER catalysts for decades [97]. Phosphide P atoms serve as bases to trap positively charged protons, improving the HER activity of the materials [98,99]. Early study investigated the amorphous transition metal–phosphorus alloy film catalysts prepared by electrodeposition, while as the study progressed, phosphide materials were formed in various ways. Ni- and Co-based phosphides are among the most studied materials. One example is the 3D microporous NiFeCoP formed on a Ni mesh (NiFeCoP/NM) reported by Zhou et al. [100], which showed a remarkably low overpotential of 33 mV at 10 mA/cm2 under alkaline conditions (Fig. 4 ). Phosphides are sometimes doped with small amounts of other non-precious elements to increase their HER activity [101]. 3.1.2 HER catalysts for acidic WE Various non-precious alloys and compound catalysts are also used for acidic HER. Under acidic conditions, the hydrogen bonding energy is a major factor in determining HER activity. Therefore, the design and understanding of non-precious catalytic materials is more straightforward in acidic than in alkaline HER. However, the corrosion resistance of the catalyst material must also be considered because the material must endure the highly corrosive acidic environment. From this viewpoint, single-component transition metal catalysts, such as Ni and Co, are unsuitable for acidic HER, owing to their low HER activity and stability. However, these properties can be greatly improved by alloying with other transition metals or forming compounds with non-metallic elements such as P, S, and Se [29]. Such catalysts are often covered with a protective carbon layer to improve their activity and stability [102,103]. Ni and Co are the most studied materials for acidic HER alloy catalysts and are often alloyed with Cu, Mo, W, or each other. NiMo alloys also exhibit high HER activity under acidic conditions [102,104]. Ito et al. reported a porous NiMo alloy catalyst covered with N-doped graphene with nanometer-sized holes (NiMo-NHG) that exhibited high HER activity and stability (Fig. 5 ) [102]. The catalyst showed a low overpotential of 30 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a negligible decrease in activity after 240 h stability testing at 20 mA/cm2 on a half-cell basis. They attributed this high activity and stability to the N-doped graphene overlayer that aids hydrogen adsorption/desorption and delays NiMo dissolution. Wang et al. reported ternary NiMoZn alloy catalysts prepared by electrodeposition [105]. They optimized the catalyst by controlling the Zn content to change the Ni and Mo oxidation states. The optimized NiMoZn catalyst (48.8:49.2:2 at.%) showed high HER activity (38 mV at 10 mA/cm2) and stability. Co-based alloy catalysts, such as CoCu, CoFe, and CoNi, were also investigated [106,107]. Feng et al. chemically synthesized CoM (M = Fe, Cu, Ni) alloy catalysts embedded in N-enriched porous carbon frameworks (CoM-NC) and tested their catalytic activity toward acidic HER [107]. Among them, the Co0.75Fe0.25-NC catalyst showed the lowest overpotential (202 mV at 10 mA/cm2) under acidic conditions. Transition-metal-based phosphides are being actively studied in acidic HER, owing to their high HER activity and corrosion resistance. Six transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, and W) are known to form transition-metal-phosphides that can be applied to HER [29]. The P atoms in these phosphides, with higher electronegativities than those of metal atoms, serve as bases to attract protons during HER and increase the corrosion resistance of the alloys [97]. These properties positively influence the HER activity and stability under acidic conditions; however, an excessive increase in the catalyst P content leads to loss of conductivity [108]. Therefore, it is important to properly control the P content within a range where the HER activity and conductivity are balanced. Under acidic conditions, phosphides comprising a single transition metal have significantly high HER activity. Wang et al. synthesized a NiP nanocatalyst supported on carbon fiber paper (CP@Ni-P) via Ni electrodeposition and subsequent phosphorization treatment, which exhibited an overpotential of 98 mV at 10 mA/cm2 under acidic conditions [109]. The CP@Ni-P catalyst showed high activity toward HER under both acidic and basic conditions. Zhou et al. reported that the interconnected urchin-like CoP microsphere film on a Ti foil delivered 10 mA/cm2 at an overpotential of 45 mV and maintained its catalytic activity for 15 h stability testing at 20 mA/cm2 under acidic conditions [110]. They attributed this high HER activity and stability to the low charge transfer resistance and high surface area of the catalyst. Han et al. reported metal-phosphide-containing porous carbons as catalysts for HER [111]. They prepared two phosphides, MoP (MoP@PC) and FeP (FeP@PC), with a uniform MoP/FeP distribution and large surface area, with respective overpotentials of 47 and 52 mV at 10 mA/cm2. A Cu3P catalyst was reported by Wang et al. [112]. They synthesized Cu3P nanoparticles coated with a N, P-codoped carbon shell (Cu3P@NPPC), which exhibited significantly improved HER performance (89 mV at 10 mA/cm2) compared to that of bulk Cu3P (292 mV at 10 mA/cm2) under acidic conditions. This improvement was attributed to the synergistic catalytic activity of the Cu3P nanoparticles and N, P-codoped carbon-shell-coated structure. Many studies have also been conducted on phosphides using secondary elements or materials [29,42,101]. For example, Bopella et al. reported a 2D CoP/NiCoP hybrid nanosheet network supported on a N-doped carbon matrix (CoP/NiCoP/NC) for a pH-universal HER catalyst [113]. The catalyst showed overpotentials of 75, 60, and 123 mV at 10 mA/cm2 for alkaline, acidic, and neutral electrolytes, respectively. They attributed this high HER activity to the collective effects of the electronic structure, CoP/NiCoP interfacial coupling, and enlarged surface area. In recent years, transition-metal-based chalcogenides have also been considered as promising materials for HER catalysis under acidic conditions. Among them, transition-metal-based sulfides are the most studied. These materials show high HER activity under acidic, alkaline, and neutral conditions because they are structurally similar to the active centers of hydrogenases and nitrogenases, which catalyze the formation of molecular hydrogen in biological systems [29]. Additionally, the electronegativity of S, which is higher than those of transition metals, favors proton adsorption thereby enhancing HER activity [114]. Mo sulfides are among the most popular sulfides as HER catalysts. Wang et al. recently reported a highly efficient MoS2 catalyst for HER by introducing single-atom vacancy defects that serve as active sites [115]. They intentionally formed single S vacancies on pristine MoS2 nanosheets using mild H2O2 etching, which lowered the MoS2 HER overpotential from 220 to 131 mV at 10 mA/cm2 under acidic conditions. MoSx can be approached with a similar strategy. Guo et al. developed a defect-rich MoSx catalyst by depositing MoSx on large-surface-area carbon nanofiber arrays [116], which achieved an overpotential of 127 mV at 10 mA/cm2 under acidic conditions. Additionally, other elements/materials can be introduced to increase the activity of the Mo sulfides. Hu et al. developed a MoS2/CoNi2S4 composite catalyst through density functional theory calculations, with hydrogen and hydroxide bonding energies that favor acidic and alkaline HER [117]. This catalyst showed fairly low overpotentials of 78 and 81 mV at 10 mA/cm2 for acidic and alkaline HER, respectively, with negligible activity loss after stability testing at 10 mA/cm2 for 48 h under both acid and alkaline conditions. Co–, Ni-, and Fe-based sulfides have also been studied as acidic HER catalysts, and generally have lower HER activities than Mo-based sulfides under acidic conditions [29,83]."
9,Application of the developed catalysts to zero-gap full-cells,"3.2 Application of the developed catalysts to zero-gap full-cells Half-cell evaluation is a suitable method for evaluating the intrinsic HER performances of non-precious catalysts as it provides an environment to focus solely on HER catalysis. Therefore, this method is a very useful analytical tool for a scientific approach to catalysts. Additionally, the three-electrode systems used for half-cell evaluation are universal, allowing the HER performance of non-precious catalysts reported by different research groups to be compared on the same basis (e.g., overpotential, Tafel slope, and exchange current density). Naturally, even in half-cell evaluations, various parameters, such as temperature, electrolyte, and potential scan rate, affect these values. Full-cell (e.g., PEM/AEM water electrolyzer) catalyst evaluation is more practical than half-cell evaluation because it tests the catalyst under actual operating conditions of WE. A larger amount of catalyst is generally required when constructing a full-cell than with a half-cell, and thus, a catalyst synthesis route capable of producing sufficient catalyst is highly desirable. The scalable synthesis method is a prerequisite for future commercialization. It is also important to distribute a catalyst firmly and evenly throughout a membrane (CCM) or PTL (CCS) for high catalyst utilization during MEA fabrication. This process depends on the type of catalyst and determines the number of triple-phase boundaries, which are the real active sites in a membrane-based water electrolyzer. For particulate catalysts, uniform catalyst coating is achieved by optimizing the composition of the catalyst slurry and the coating method. However, for an electrodeposited catalyst, uniform electrodeposition is induced by surface pretreatment of the substrate (PTL). Generally, a full-cell is evaluated up to a current density more than ten-fold higher than that of a half-cell. This indicates that the catalyst should endure much harsher conditions, which is particularly related directly to the durability of non-precious catalysts. The cell components (e.g., PTL and gasket) and conditions (e.g., compression pressure, water feed rate, temperature, and hot-press) also affect the overall cell performance, and all these factors must be optimized according to the applied catalyst. Owing to this complexity, reported academic catalyst evaluations at the full-cell level are uncommon. Moreover, research on catalysts is focused on competitively implementing high performance at the half-cell level without considering their applicability to real systems, further limiting examples of catalysts developed at the half-cell level that have been actually applied to zero-gap full-cells. Indeed, although these catalysts may perform well in half-cells, the catalyst synthesis method is often very demanding, while thermodynamic stability is poor (low entropy state owing to complex structures). Therefore, it is difficult to manufacture MEAs using these catalysts, and when created, the performance and durability at the full-cell level are unsatisfactory. Thus, the development of catalysts should be based on an understanding of the complexity of zero-gap full-cell systems, giving priority to the ease of catalyst/electrode fabrication for manufacturing MEAs of appropriate structures that consider the various overpotentials. Particularly, the gap between catalysts developed at this half-cell level and their actual full-cell applications in terms of large-scale mass production of MEAs significantly increases. The performance evaluations of several full-cells introduced below have very special implications in terms of the applicability of the developed catalyst to zero-gap full-cells. Notably, as the number of reported full-cell results increases, the full-cell evaluation method becomes more standardized, enabling the determination of the true performance of a catalyst in a water electrolyzer. 3.2.1 AEMWE The biggest obstacles to improve the performance of AEM water electrolyzers are the AEM stability and ionic conductivity; however, the development of a catalyst with high activity is also important. Particularly, a deep understanding of how to integrate the developed catalyst into an actual AEM water electrolyzer is essential. This section presents a few reported examples of the application of non-precious HER catalysts to AEM water electrolyzers. Pavel et al. investigated the effect of loading a commercial Ni/CeO2-La2O3/C HER catalyst on the AEMWE performance [57]. They used a commercial CuCoOx mixed oxide catalyst (Acta 3030, Acta SpA) and an AEM (A201, Tokuyama) as the OER catalyst and membrane, respectively. The AEM electrolysis cell potential at 470 mA/cm2 decreased from 2.01 to 1.89 V as the HER catalyst loading increased from 0.6 to 7.4 mg/cm2, indicating that the cell performance increased with increasing HER catalyst loading. For a cost-effective AEM water electrolyzer, it is important to maximize catalyst utilization to achieve maximum cell performance with minimal catalyst loading. The utilization of the catalyst was greatly improved by directly electrodepositing the Ni catalyst on the carbon paper (Ni/CP) used as the cathode and anode [54]. In this study, a Ni/CP catalyst with a markedly high roughness factor was prepared through the optimization of Ni electrodeposition conditions. The MEA composed of these electrodes and a commercial AEM (A201, Tokuyama) showed a high cell performance of 150 mA/cm2 at 1.9 V with an extremely low Ni loading (8.5 μg/cm2). The HER activity of Ni can be increased by introducing other non-precious elements to form alloys or compounds [29,118]. However, few cases of applying these catalysts to actual AEM water electrolyzers exist. There are several reports of Ni-based alloy catalysts applied to AEM water electrolyzers, such as NiMo, NiCu, and NiFeCo. Xiao et al. reported the first AEM water electrolyzer working with pure water, using a NiMo HER catalyst [24]. They achieved a stable cell performance of 400 mA/cm2 at ∼ 1.85 V by introducing a stainless-steel fiber felt cathode for high NiMo loading (40 mg/cm2). The scale-up version of an AEM water electrolyzer using a NiMo catalyst has also been recently reported [119]. To fabricate a large-area electrode (100 cm2), an electrodeposition method was introduced to form NiMo catalyst on Cu foam, which was used as the cathode. With this cathode, the electrolyzer performed at room temperature, in the current range 20–55 A, at cell potentials of 2.2–2.9 V. The electrolyzer also showed stable performance for 24 h at a cell potential of 2.05 V. Chen et al. reported a highly efficient AEM water electrolyzer using NiMo catalysts for both cathode and anode, but in slightly different forms [81]. The cathode NiMo catalyst (NiMo-NH3/H2) was prepared by reducing NiMoO4 under an NH3/H2 (5% H2) atmosphere at 550 °C. Fe electrochemical doping was additionally performed when this catalyst was applied to the anode. The AEM water electrolyzer comprising these catalysts exhibited a cell performance of 1 A/cm2 at 1.77 V and a stable performance at 0.5 A/cm2 for 25 h (Fig. 6 ) [81]. NiAlMo powder deposited on a stainless steel gradient porous metal framework by plasma spraying was also applied to an AEM water electrolyzer [120]. This powder is the raw material of Raney-type NiMo and displays high HER activity [121,122]. Although this study focused on NiAlMo application to the anode, the AEM water electrolyzer with NiAlMo applied to both cathode and anode achieved a cell potential of 2.1 V at a current density of 2 A/cm2. NiCu alloy catalysts are also well known for their high stability and HER activity under alkaline conditions. Faid et al. synthesized NiCu mixed metal oxide (MMO) nanosheets containing Ni, NiO, CuO, and hydroxide species by chemical reduction [123]. The NiCu MMO catalyst supported on carbon black was superior to those obtained with metallic NiCu alloy catalyst. The high HER activity of the NiCu MMO catalyst was attributed to the combined effects of Ni to induce hydrogen adsorption, NiO to induce water dissociation and hydroxide ion adsorption, and CuO to stabilize NiO. The optimized AEM water electrolyzer using NiCu MMO catalyst as the cathode exhibited a high cell performance of 1.85 A/cm2 at 2 V (Fig. 7 ) [123]. A NiFeCo alloy powder was also used as the cathode catalyst for AEM water electrolyzers [124]. The MEA, fabricated by sandwiching a polybenzimidazole (PBI)-based membrane between the NiFeCo cathode and NiFeOx anode, showed a cell performance of 1 A/cm2 at 1.9 V. Some compound catalysts such as transition metal sulfides have also been applied to AEM water electrolyzers. Ganessan et al. demonstrated an AEM water electrolyzer, operating with a NiFeS cathode and anode, with a cell performance of 274 mA/cm2 at 2.0 V [125]. The NiFeS catalyst was simply prepared by sequential electrochemical deposition of NiFe and NiFeS on Ni foam. Co3S4 nanosheets (Co3S4 NS/NF), fabricated by sequential Co electrodeposition, calcination, and sulfurization on Ni foam, were also used as a cathode catalyst in AEMWE by Park et al. [114]. The S content was controlled by the sulfurization time, and the catalyst with the highest S content (14.72 at.%) exhibited the highest HER activity. The MEA fabricated with the Co3S4 NS/NF cathode showed a cell performance of 0.431 A/cm2 at 2.0 V and stable performance at 0.5 A/cm2 over 12 h. There was one case where a phosphide catalyst was applied to an AEM water electrolyzer. Chang et al. reported Ni12P5/Ni3(PO4)2 hollow spheres (HS) with a core–shell structure as a bifunctional catalyst in which the Ni12P5 core and Ni3(PO4)2 shell are responsible for high HER and OER activities, respectively [126]. With this bifunctional catalyst, a stable and high-performance AEM water electrolyzer (0.358 A/cm2 at 1.8 V) was realized, which was competitive with the electrolyzer using IrO2 anode and Pt black cathode (399 mA/cm2 at 1.8 V) under the same testing conditions. Table 1 summarizes the reported performances of AEM water electrolyzers using non-precious HER catalysts as cathode materials. Very limited cases of non-precious HER catalysts developed in half-cell systems have been applied to AEM electrolyzers. This is probably because WE under alkaline conditions has mostly been investigated for conventional alkaline water electrolyzers using aqueous KOH electrolyte and separator/diaphragm. AEMWE is a relatively recent technology boosted by the development of AEM. Therefore, the accumulation of technologies and knowledge in materials, processes, and manufacturing techniques required for the fabrication of MEAs for AEMWE is necessary. Particularly, the fabrication technology of MEAs requires thorough experimental knowledge. Apart from this lack of existing data, absolute comparison of the catalyst performances (Table 1) is difficult because the evaluation conditions of each research group are different. Generally, transition-metal-based alloy catalysts performed slightly better in AEM water electrolyzers than did compound catalysts. One possible cause for this is the low electrical conductivity of the compound catalysts. Up to now, the NiMo-NH3/H2 catalyst clearly showed the highest performance among the catalysts applied to AEM water electrolyzers, with a current density of 1/A cm2 at a cell voltage of 1.77 V and a mass-specific activity of 0.33 A/mg [81]. This catalyst also showed the highest HER activity in the half-cell test (11 mV at 10 mA/cm2); however, the results of a half-cell test do not necessarily match those of a full-cell test. For the NiCu MMO catalyst [123], the overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 measured in a half-cell system was 200 mV, which is much larger than that of NiMo-NH3/H2. The performance of this catalyst was comparable (∼0.8 A/cm2 at 1.75 V) to that of NiMo-NH3/H2 in a full-cell system. These examples indicate that assessment of the catalyst activity with only a half-cell test is incomplete. The true performance of the catalyst should be measured at the full-cell level, which has progressed to the optimization of the MEA fabrication. These results suggest a direction for the development of non-precious HER catalysts for AEM water electrolyzers. For these catalysts to be integrated into AEM water electrolyzers, scalability and reliability must first be secured in the catalyst synthesis method. Moreover, a deep understanding of MEA fabrication using these catalysts is necessary. The formation of triple-phase boundaries is usually determined during MEA fabrication. Therefore, the MEA optimization process is critical to reconcile these catalysts with AEMs, PTLs, and ionomers [52,127]. The porosity and conductivity of the catalyst layer should also be considered. Because non-precious HER catalysts often have lower mass-specific activity than do precious HER catalysts, a larger amount of non-precious catalyst must be applied to the MEA, resulting in a thicker catalyst layer. To induce a facile HER reaction, even in such a thick catalyst layer, it is important to secure sufficient catalyst porosity and conductivity. 3.2.2 PEMWE There are more reports of applying non-precious HER catalysts to PEM than to AEM water electrolyzers. Ni and/or Co-based alloys also show good HER activity under acidic conditions, some of which have been applied to PEM water electrolyzers. Kim et al. studied NiW catalysts for PEMWE prepared by electrodeposition [128]. They introduced electrochemically prepared Cu nanowires as a base material to increase the surface area of the electrodeposited NiW catalyst. The HER catalytic activity (NiW/Cu NW/CP) showed volcano-like behavior according to the W content, and an overpotential of 56 mV at 10 mA/cm2 was obtained at the optimum W content (4 at.%). With this catalyst, a cell performance of 1.79 A/cm2 at 2.0 V was achieved in PEMWE [128]. For Co-based alloys, Co3O4, CoCu, and CoMo catalysts have been studied for HER in PEMWE. Co3O4 is a potential bifunctional catalyst for both HER and OER in WE, owing to its structural features and high electrical conductivity [129,130]. Ampurdanés et al. evaluated the Co3O4 HER catalyst performance in PEMWE [129]. They found the optimal composition of the Co3O4 catalyst as an HER catalyst by adjusting the Co3O4 powder-to-carbon black (Vucan XC72) ratio, and the optimized catalyst showed 0.55 A/cm2 at 2.05 V in PEMWE. The electrodeposited CoCu alloy on carbon paper (CoCu/CP) in PEMWE was studied by Kim et al. [106]. They experimentally confirmed that by alloying with Co, theoretically, Cu can provide a counterbalance for the hydrogen adsorption energy for efficient HER and improve corrosion resistance. At the optimum composition, the CoCu/CP catalyst showed a cell performance of 1.2 A/cm2 at 2.0 V in PEMWE. The nanocrystalline CuMo alloy catalyst was also applied to a PEM water electrolyzer [131]. Cu itself is not highly active toward HER under acidic conditions [132]. However, Cu alloyed with a small amount of Mo through electrodeposition showed high HER activity. The addition of Mo to Cu altered the Mo electronic structure and formed high-surface-area nanocrystalline CuMo grains, which affected HER activity. The CuMo catalyst comprising the optimum Mo content (6.4 at.%) exhibited a cell performance of 0.5 A/cm2 at 1.9 V and a high mass activity of 3.4 A/mg in PEMWE [131]. A ternary alloy catalyst, CuNiMo, was also recently applied to a PEM water electrolyzer by Choi et al [133]. They used electrodeposition method to fabricate CuNiMo alloys with a wide composition range and found the composition optimized for HER. The Cu44.4Ni46Mo9.6 catalyst showed an overpotential of 18 mV at 10 mA/cm2 with a Tafel slope of 27.7 mV/dec in a half-cell test. This catalyst also showed high performance (1.62 A/cm2 at 1.9 V) and stability in a PEM water electrolyzer. PEM water electrolyzers using transition metal phosphide HER catalysts have also been reported. Kim et al. achieved electrodeposited NiP catalysts with high P contents by introducing pulse-reverse electrodeposition involving NiP electrodeposition and selective Ni dissolution [55]. The selective Ni dissolution also increased the surface area. The P content was controlled within 8–34 at.%, and the highest HER activity was exhibited at a P content of 22 at.%. The electrodeposited NiP on carbon paper (Ni78P22/CP) with 22 at.% P was applied to a PEM water electrolyzer, resulting in a cell performance of 1.31 A/cm2 at 2.0 V. Electrodeposited NiP becomes amorphous with increasing P content, and HER activity is primarily determined from this content [55,134]. However, for the crystalline NiP, the crystallinity affects HER activity, not the P content [135,136]. Owens-Baird et al. studied two structural polymorphs (cubic and monoclinic) of NiP2 [135]. Their theoretical calculations showed that cubic NiP2 is a semimetal, while monoclinic NiP2 is an n-type semiconductor. In both half-cell tests, the HER activity was higher for cubic than for monoclinic NiP2 under acidic conditions, which was also reflected in the PEM water electrolyzer. These results demonstrated that the bulk-phase structure of NiP2 also affects the HER activity. Fe-based phosphide alloys are also attractive as HER catalysts for PEMWE. Sapountzi et al. developed a facile and scalable synthesis of a nanocrystalline FeP catalyst and demonstrated this catalyst as an HER catalyst [137]. They attributed the high HER activity to the preferential [010] orientation of the catalyst [136], which showed a cell performance of 0.2 A/cm2 at 2.06 V in a PEM water electrolyzer at very low temperature (22 °C). King et al. first demonstrated a commercial PEM water electrolyzer operating with CoP as the cathode material [138]. At a current density of 1.86 A/cm2, the cell potential of the PEM water electrolyzer was 2.27 V, which was 0.220 V higher than that of the PEM water electrolyzer using Pt black as the cathode material. Although the CoP cathode performance was inferior to that of Pt black, this study showed the potential of non-precious HER catalysts for application to commercial PEM water electrolyzers. Compound catalysts such as transition metal sulfides have also been applied to PEM water electrolyzers. Mo sulfides are promising HER catalysts under acidic conditions, owing to their high HER activity and stability [26,29]. However, few studies that apply Mo sulfides to PEM water electrolyzers exist. Corrales-Sánchez et al. applied three forms of MoS2 catalysts [pristine MoS2, MoS2 physically mixed with carbon black (MoS2/C), and MoS2 supported on reduced graphene (MoS2/rGO)] to PEM water electrolyzers [139]. They optimized several conditions, including the catalyst-to-carbon ratio, catalyst loading, and hot-pressing, to ensure superior catalytic performances. The best cell performance was 0.3 A/cm2 at 1.9 V with MoS2/C (47 wt%). Amorphous MoSx and molecular MoSx clusters have also been recognized as efficient HER catalysts, owing to their similar active sites to those of MoS2 [140]. Ng et al. synthesized two types of Mo sulfide catalysts supported on carbon black, namely MoSx and [Mo3S13]2− nanoclusters [141]. The MoSx-based PEM water electrolyzer showed a cell potential of 1.86 V at 0.5 A/cm2, while that with [Mo3S13]2− nanoclusters was 1.81 V. Additionally, S-doped Mo phosphide (MoP|S) supported on carbon black was tested and showed 1.81 V at 0.5 A/cm2 in the PEM water electrolyzer. Lu et al. applied amorphous MoSx (a-MoSx) with increased S vacancies to a PEM water electrolyzer [142], wherein the S vacancies in a-MoSx are main active sites for HER [29,140]. They increased the S vacancies in a-MoSx by introducing remote H2 plasma. The a-MoSx-based PEM water electrolyzer achieved 2.76 V at 1 A/cm2, which is superior to that of the Pt-based alternative (3.05 V). Kim et al. studied the electrodeposited a-MoSx on carbon paper as a PEM water electrolyzer cathode [56]. They investigated the chemical state of S in a-MoSx and observed that the intrinsic HER activity of a-MoSx increased with increasing proportion of high-binding-energy S atoms. The best cell performance obtained with a-MoSx was 0.38 A/cm2 at 1.9 V. [Mo3S13]2− clusters anchored to N-doped carbon nanotubes (Mo3S13-CNCNT) were also applied to PEM water electrolyzers [143]. The catalyst exhibited an overpotential of 188 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 58 mV/dec in 0.5 M H2SO4, which are comparable to other Mo sulfide results. However, the catalyst outperformed in a PEM water electrolyzer, with 4 A/cm2 at 2.36 V (Fig. 8 ) [143]. The stability of the electrolyzer was also guaranteed for 100 h at 1 A/cm2. Another MoSx cluster, [Mo3S4]4+, has also been applied as cathode material for PEM water electrolyzers [144]. Two types of [Mo3S4]4+-based complexes, [Mo3S4(H2O)3(acacbutyl)3]+ and [Mo3S4Pd(H2O)3(acacbutyl)3]+, were synthesized and tested. With [Mo3S4Pd(H2O)3(acacbutyl)3]+ catalyst, they achieved a PEM water electrolyzer showing a cell performance of ∼ 0.4 A/cm2 at 2.3 V. A bimetallic FeMoS was reported by Morozan et al. [145]. The small amounts of Fe incorporated in the amorphous MoSx increased the HER activity, with an overpotential of 140 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 57 mV/dec. In a PEM water electrolyzer, the MEA using the FeMoS cathode delivered a current density of 1 A/cm2 at 1.85 V. Other transition metal sulfides were also reported. Kim et al. integrated the fern-like NiCoOS catalyst on carbon paper as a cathode for a PEM water electrolyzer [146]. They fabricated the catalyst by NiCoO electrodeposition and subsequent S ion exchange reaction. The catalyst with the highest overall HER activity achieved a cell performance of 0.72 A/cm2 at 2.0 V. Fe sulfides with different stoichiometries were also implemented as cathode catalysts in the PEM water electrolyzers [147]. The HER catalytic activity was in the order FeS2 > Fe3S4 > Fe9S10 in proportion with the S atomic density, where S2 2− ions contribute to the catalytic activity. The reported performances of PEM water electrolyzers using non-precious HER catalysts as cathode materials are summarized in Table 2 . As an alloy catalyst, the Cu44.4Ni46Mo9.6 catalyst exhibited a considerably high performance (2.5 A/cm2 at 2.0 V) in a PEM water electrolyzer [133]. Compound catalysts, such as Mo3S13-NCNT, also exhibited significantly high performances in full-cell systems [55,143]. Notably, the catalyst formed by electrodeposition showed a significantly high performance in the PEM water electrolyzer. Electrodeposited catalysts usually display poor contact with the membrane in the fabrication of MEAs, which degrades the MEA performance in PEM fuel cells [148,149]. However, in a PEM water electrolyzer, these catalysts compete well with other particulate catalysts. Although few examples exist, the same holds for AEM water electrolyzers. Ease of catalyst synthesis and MEA optimization are essential for the development of non-precious HER catalysts for PEMWE [150,151]. Particularly, in PEMWE, it is important to secure the porosity and conductivity of a non-precious catalyst because the difference in mass-specific activity between a precious and non-precious catalyst is often large. Additionally, consideration of the non-precious catalyst corrosion resistance is highly important [152,153]. Currently, the stability of most non-precious HER catalysts is measured at constant cathodic potential/voltage or current density, where a reducing environment is created in both half-cell and full-cell systems. However, the severe corrosion of non-precious HER catalysts in open circuit must also be considered."
10,Conclusion: Summary and outlook,"In this review, we highlight the recent advances in the non-precious HER catalysts implemented in the AEM and PEM water electrolyzers. To date, many non-precious HER catalysts have been discovered and studied; however, comparatively, practical applications of catalysts to AEM and PEM water electrolyzers are limited. In AEM electrolyzers, Ni-based materials have been mostly used as HER catalysts and sometimes applied simultaneously as OER catalysts. A wider variety of HER catalysts, including transition metal alloys, phosphides, and sulfides, have been studied in PEMWE. These studies have demonstrated the potential of non-precious HER catalysts as alternatives to Pt-based materials. However, several challenges in non-precious HER catalysts implemented in AEM and PEMWE remain: (1) Catalysts need to be evaluated in AEM and PEM full-cell electrolyzers. Many non-precious HER catalysts have only been evaluated at the half-cell level, yet the practical applicability of a catalyst can only be assessed in real AEM and PEM electrolyzers. (2) An established standardized evaluation method for HER catalysts in AEM and PEM water electrolyzers is essential to equally compare the different catalysts developed by different research groups. From the current data, it is difficult to compare the performance of various catalysts because the anode catalyst, temperature, and membrane of the electrolyzer differ. Not all research groups can set the components of the electrolyzer exactly to the same values; however, a minimum commonality should be established without disturbing the research. (3) The development of new materials with improved HER activity is always desirable. Although many non-precious metal catalysts with high HER activity have been reported, robust catalysts that equal Pt are yet to be developed."
