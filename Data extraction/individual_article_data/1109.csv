0,Introduction,"Currently, fossil fuels present the bulk of world energy resources [1]. The perennial overconsumption of these fuels, however, has not only led to numerous debilitating effects on the environment, such as global warming and air pollution, but it will also unmistakably end in these resources depletion [2]. Consequently, an increasing focus on alternative sources of energy has arisen to reduce fossil fuels dependency [3] Fermentative biogas rich in hydrogen or methane from organic wastes is widely considered as a clean and environmentally-friendly source of energy [4,5], as it combines waste treatment and renewable energy production [6]. Further, it can be produced by several methods comprising biological and electrochemical processes. Bio-photolysis of water, photo fermentation, and dark fermentation have grown in popularity in bio-hydrogen production. Such interest is due to their low investment costs compared with photocatalytic, oxidation, and other chemical technologies [1]. Dark fermentation (DF) has particularly attracted a marked interest because it could be conducted under ambient conditions (temperature, pressure), has low energy requirements, low operating costs, and it can also produce valuable products (e.g. volatile fatty acids (VFA), hydrogen) from a variety of organic wastes [7]. Additionally, it offers simultaneous waste stabilization, volume reduction, and energy recovery [8]. Notwithstanding, the main weaknesses of dark fermentation are its low hydrogen yield and the rapid accumulation of volatile fatty acids, resulting in a drop in pH under the range of optimum pH (5.5–5.6), and consequently the inhibition of the process [9]. Some approaches such as the pretreatment of the substrate have been developed to enhance process productivity. For instance, mechanical, thermal, chemical, and biological actions have reported positive impacts on hydrogen production by DF. These processes allow process intensification as well as biodegradability improvement, which in turn accelerate the organic matter degradation with faster kinetics [10,11]. However, given that the pretreatment approach requires a considerable amount of either energy, chemicals, or energy and chemicals [9], post treatment has been suggested to produce biogas from the DF effluent [12]. Bio-electrochemical systems have been developed and proposed as a technology suitable to be integrated with DF [9,13]. Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC), specifically, is the most promising post-treatment technology to enhance biohydrogen production since it offers many advantages in comparison with other technologies. Typically, MEC operates mostly at voltages beneath 1.0 V and lower voltages than those of water and water-alcohol electrolysis [14]. In the anode compartment of the MEC, organic molecules are oxidized by microbes, generating electrons and protons that are then transported to the cathode, where hydrogen is produced. Some researchers reported that hydrogen production with a DF and MEC integrated process was 13 times higher than that with traditional DF [5], and 3 times higher when compared to DF alone [15] with a hydrogen yield of 1608.6 ± 266.2 mL H2/g CODconsumed from agro-industrial wastewaters and 236 mL H2/gCOD using palm oil mill effluent as a substrate, respectively. Wang et al. [16] also stated a 41 % increase in overall hydrogen yield (9.1 mmol H2/g COD to 33.2 mmol H2/gCOD) from cellulose by integrating dark fermentation with MEC. Other studies similarly confirmed the efficiency of coupling DF and MEC [9,15] Previous work showed that the MEC reactor effluent contains a high concentration of VFA, mainly acetic acid and butyric acid [17], which can be further converted into methane via anaerobic digestion. Thus, biomethanation as a tertiary treatment of the MEC effluent could increase process efficiency. The possibility of connecting both microbial fuel cell and MEC to dark fermentation was explored by Wang et al. [16]. However, the goal of the present work is to propose a new integrated process for the production of hydrogen and methane by combining DF, MEC and biomethanation. Indeed, supplying a tertiary treatment for the existing coupled process could bring new avenues for combining green energy technologies. Therefore, the three-stage approach is the trend of the field. Herein, it’s noteworthy that there are various factors affecting hydrogen and methane production of the coupled processes through DF and MEC. Hence, further research efforts toward a deeper understanding of the process. These include microbiological (e.g. inoculum source, adaptation), architectural (electrodes material, MEC configuration, surface area of electrodes, applied voltage) [18–20] and physico-chemical parameters (e.g. pH, temperature) [21,22]. The optimization of a set of different parameters is therefore required to obtain maximum yields and process efficiency, and ultimately high energy yields. The conventional method of varying a parameter and fixing others is comparatively inefficient when optimizing multiple parameters because the interaction between them is not observed. Accordingly, experimental design techniques using different mathematical models such as factorial design, Taguchi’s method, and response surface methodology (RSM) have been developed to promote operating conditions optimization [23]. It was selected to monitor the substrate to inoculum ratio because it has been shown to impact microbial growth, and an optimum ratio would allow the microorganisms to use the available substrate effectively. The applied voltage has also been the topic of analysis in this study. Preliminary reports have shown that the posed voltage could speed up the organic matter degradation, maintain the pH inside the digester, and stabilize the process. Electrode spacing is another influential factor in process performance optimization. These parameters have been separately studied so far. Indeed, their effect on hydrogen and methane production has not been exhaustively explained yet [17,24–26]. Methodic investigations, through the optimization of the combined effects of these controlled variables and the provision of the relationship between the controlled parameters and gas generation effectiveness, would be a valuable leap in understanding how this technology fits the existing infrastructure and where it might be best applied. To the best of our knowledge, no work on the simultaneous optimization of methane and hydrogen has ever been reported. Hence, this study pioneers the assessment of the implementation of a three-stage integrated process of dark fermentation, microbial electrolysis cell, and biomethanation for hydrogen and methane production. The appraisal of hydrogen and methane production potential from food waste was made in three stages, denoting the threefold purpose of this study: (1) to develop a new integrated bioprocess for hydrogen and methane production and evaluate its performance and energy recovery (2) to investigate the effects of the substrate to inoculum ratio, the electrode distance of the MEC reactor, and the applied voltage between the two electrodes providing data about how three key factors could affect and act together on hydrogen and methane production from food waste by the three-stage process, and (3) to use the dual response surface methodology to determine the optimal conditions. A factorial design for three parameters at three levels each was used to develop the model."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Substrate and inoculum,"2.1 Substrate and inoculum In this study, food waste was used as substrate. It was collected from a catering company which provides meals for schools, daycare centers for children and canteens in Potsdam (Germany). The food waste was crushed in a kitchen blender and stored in a freezer at −18 °C until its use for chemical analyses and fermentation experiments. No further pretreatment of the FW was applied. The composition and characteristics of the FW are shown in Table 1 . The inoculum for fermentation experiments consisted of a mixture of digestate from an agricultural biogas plant operating on dairy manure and crop silages and digestate from various anaerobic digestion experiments at laboratory scale with manures, crop feed stocks and organic wastes. For application of the inoculum for DF, it was pretreated by heat treatment in an autoclave at 100 °C for 20 min to kill methanogens and then enriched for hydrogen production by adding peptone and glucose performing two consecutive cycles of dark fermentation for 6 days as reported by [27]. Before adaptation, the inoculum was enriched with nutrients (g/L):NH4Cl (1), KH2PO4 (0.3), K2HPO4(0.3),MgCl2 (0.25), CaCl2 (0.1), MgSO4 (3),CuSO4 (0.01), FeSO4 (0.1), Na2MoO4 (0.01), Ni(NO3)26H2O (0.0003), NaHCO3(3.45),KHCO3(1.72) [1] in order to provide optimum conditions for microbial growth and biomass conversion in terms of nutrient supply. Chemical parameters of the inoculum are presented in Table 1."
3,Dark fermentation experiments,"2.2 Dark fermentation experiments Dark fermentation experiments were conducted on batch mode using an automatic methane potential test system (AMPTS II, Bioprocess Control, Lund, Sweden) allowing up to 15 parallel batch experiments [28]. Tests were carried out in 500 mL glass bottles with a working volume of 400 mL. The initial pH was adjusted to 6 ± 0.2 using 1 M NaOH and/or 1 M HCl [29]. Bottles were flushed with nitrogen to achieve anaerobic conditions and then incubated in a heated water bath at 37 °C for 4 days. The content of each bottle was continuously mixed by a slowly rotating stirrer at 30 rpm time intervals of 60 s to ensure homogenous mixing of the reactor content in the experimental setting. Biogas produced was passed through a 3 M NaOH solution in order to remove carbon dioxide. The volume of hydrogen was calculated as the sum of hydrogen volume produced daily corrected for the hydrogen volume produced by the blank test and normalized to standard conditions (gas temperature 0 °C, pressure 1013 hPa, dry gas)."
4,Electrochemical set up,"2.3 Electrochemical set up A single chamber MEC was used for hydrogen production from DF effluent directly after the DF step. Both anode and cathode were made from carbon rod (CP-Handels GmbH, Germany) with a surface area of 16 cm2 and 19 cm2, respectively. All experiments were conducted using an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and carried out for 3 days under potentiostatic control using a potentiostat equipped with 5 independent channels. The reference electrode, placed near to the cathode, and the anode were immersed perpendicularly inside the bottles and fixed at the desired distance apart from each other. Wires were deployed to connect the system to the power supply. The bottles were closed very tightly using silicone rubber stoppers and screw caps. Besides, silicon was used to seal the bottles and to eliminate any gas leakage from the bottles. Reactors were heated in a water bath at 37 °C. The volume of hydrogen produced in MEC reactors was measured using the AMPTS as described in section 2.2. The effluents of MEC were conserved in sealed bottles at −18 °C to preserve the final composition to be tested in the third stage of methane production."
5,Methane production,"2.4 Methane production In order to start the third step for methane production, untreated inoculum was added to the reactors. The substrate to inoculum ratio for biomethanation was fixed to 0.5 [30] based on the VS of the electrolysis cell effluents, and the required volumes of food waste and inoculum were adjusted to meet a final working volume of 400 mL. Biomethanation was conducted for 14 days at a mesophilic temperature of 37 °C. The AMPTS II system was used for fermentation experiments, gas upgrading, and methane volume measurement as described in section 2.2."
6,Chemical analysis,"2.5 Chemical analysis The analysis of total solids (TS), volatile solids (VS), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were performed according to DIN standard methods [31]. Volatile fatty acids (VFA) including acetic (C2), propionic (C3), butyric and i-butyric (C4 and iC4), valeric and i-valeric (C5 and iC5), and caproic and i-caproic (C6 and iC6) acids were determined using a gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a PERMABOND®FFAP capillary column (Machery-Nagel GmbH & Co KG, Düren, Germany), and a ﬂame ionization detector [31]. The TS content of the food waste samples and effluents were corrected for losses of organic acids and alcohols during oven drying, as described by [32]. Methane and hydrogen yields that are based on VS refer to the corrected TS and VS content. The experiments of all conditions were performed once time admitting that replicates could have increased the accuracy."
7,Experimental design,"2.6 Experimental design A full factorial experimental design tool of the software Statistica12 was used to investigate the effect of the substrate to inoculum ratio (S/X) (X1), the applied voltage during MEC experiments (X2), and the distance between the two electrodes of the electrolysis cell (X3) on hydrogen and methane production in the three-stage process,. X1, X2 and X3 were used as independent variables, while H2 and CH4 volumes were used as dependent variables. The independent variable levels used in the design were S/X ratio (X2) (0.5; 1; 1.5); applied voltage (X2) (0.4 V; 0.6 V; 0.8 V) and the distance between the two electrodes (X3) (2 cm; 3 cm; 4 cm). Taking into account that food waste with high degradability efficiency was used as substrate, a substrate to inoculum ratio range of 0.5–1.5 was assumed unlikely to favor VFA accumulation and inhibit the process [33]. Previous studies reported that a practical voltage of 0.4 V is required to overcome the electrodes over potentials and the ohmic losses and high applied voltage harmed the microbial activity [15]. The selected levels of the electrode spacing were thus maintained to avert short-circuiting and provide sufficient surface for the electrons and protons to travel from the anode to the cathode [34]. The design of experiments (DOE) was used to analyze the effects of the studied factors on the two responses. In order to fit the response and correlate it to variables, a quadratic model mathematically described with the following equation Eq. (1) was used. (1) Y = b 0 + ∑ i = 1 n b i X i + ∑ i = 1 n b i i X i 2 + ∑ ∑ i < j = 1 n b X i X j Where Y is the corresponding response variable and Xi are the actual values of the independent variables, b letters are the coefficients of the function (b0 the offset coefficient; bi the linear; bij the interactions; and bii the quadratic coefficients). The optimal conditions were determined using dual-response surface methodology (DRS). The DRS approach has been developed to conduct a simultaneous optimization of multiple responses. This method combines the two individual desirabilities into a single objective function which presents the relationships between the two responses [35]."
8,Calculations,"2.7 Calculations The energy yields (kJ/gVS) were calculated based on hydrogen and methane superior heat of combustion (12.74 kJ/L and 35.16 kJ/L, respectively) as reported by García-Depraect et al. [36]. The overall energy yield generated from the three-stage process was determined as the energy obtained from H2 generation together with the energy yield from CH4 production."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Statistical experimental design,"3.1 Statistical experimental design Table 2 shows the design matrix of coded and encoded independent factors and observed responses. By applying the DOE analysis to experimental data using factorial design, the polynomial model of hydrogen volume was described by the following equation Eq. (2): (2) Y = − 15338.8 + 8994.2 X 1 + 27133.6 X 2 + 12442 X 3 − 5270.6 X 1 2 − 22005.9 X 2 2 − 1846.3 X 3 2 + 18501.2 X 1 X 2 − 9042.0 X 1 X 3 − 25768.3 X 2 X 3 − 8257.9 X 1 X 2 2 − 2959.7 X 1 2 X 2 + 1182.3 X 1 X 3 2 + 3967.1 X 1 2 X 3 + 4213.3 X 2 X 3 2 + 19687.6 X 2 2 X 3 − 984.8 X 1 2 X 2 2 − 502.6 X 1 2 X 3 2 − 3338.7 X 2 2 X 3 2 According to Eq. (2), the three variables X1, X2, and X3 had favorable effects due to their positive coefficient (8994.2; 27133.6; 12442). On the other hand, the interaction effects of the three variables had different implications on hydrogen production. Table 3 shows the statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) for hydrogen response. Higher F-values and the p-value lower than 0.05 indicate the significance of the model term [12]. In the case of hydrogen volume, results show that the linear term of the substrate to inoculum ratio (X1) and the interaction between the linear term of the applied voltage and that of the electrode distance (X2X3) are relevant for hydrogen formation at 99 % probability level given that the p-values,0.00049 and 0.0052 respectively, are lower than 0.01. Besides, the linear term of the distance between the two electrodes (X3) had a significant effect on hydrogen production at 95 % probability level since the p-value (0.032) is lower than 0.05. Furthermore, ANOVA analyses also indicate that there is a significant interaction not only between the linear term of the substrate to inoculum ratio and the quadratic term of the applied voltage (X1 X 2 2 ), but also between the quadratic term of the substrate to inoculum ratio and the linear term of the electrode distance ( X 1 2 X 3 ), and the quadratic term of the substrate to inoculum ratio and the linear term of the applied voltage ( X 1 2 X 2 ) owing to the p-values of 0.037, 0.020 and 0.036, respectively. Based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) and keeping the significant terms, the empirical model of hydrogen generation could be described as follow: Other terms with p-values exceeding 0.05, were conceived as having non-significant effects on hydrogen formation. The experimental values versus those predicted for hydrogen potential are presented in Fig. 1 . The figure reveals that the experimental values and those predicted are well distributed, and there exists a noteworthy correlation between them. In this view, a regression coefficient (R2) of 0.9159 implied that 91.59 % of the variability in the response could be explained by the empirical model. Based on ANOVA analysis and keeping the significant terms, the empirical model of hydrogen generation could be described as follow (3) Y = − 15338.8 + 8994.2 X 1 + 12442 X 3 − 22005.9 X 2 2 − 25768.3 X 2 X 3 − 8257.9 X 1 X 2 2 − 2959.7 X 1 2 X 2 + 3967.1 X 1 2 X 3 The empirical model of methane volume was described by the following equation Eq. (4): (4) Y = 14976.7 − 4935.4 X 1 − 39955.9 X 2 − 9823.1 X 3 + 2245.7 X 1 2 + 30023.8 X 2 2 + 1629.3 X 3 2 + 4527.3 X 1 X 2 + 1547.6 X 1 X 3 + 30136.2 X 2 X 3 − 4646.1 X 1 X 2 2 − 2959.7 X 1 2 X 2 ° − 195.3 X 1 X 3 2 − 113.9 X 1 2 X 3 − 5065.0 X 2 X 3 2 − 23792.7 X 2 2 X 3 + 1789.4 X 1 2 X 2 2 − 6.6 X 1 2 X 3 2 + 3959.9 X 2 2 X 3 2 According to Eq. (4), the applied voltage was the most influential factor on CH4 volume owing to its high coefficient followed by the electrode distance while, the substrate to inoculum ratio had the lowest effect on CH4 formation due to its lower coefficient. ANOVA analyses shown in Table 4 implied that only the linear term of the substrate to inoculum ratio (X1) and the interaction between the quadratic term of the substrate to inoculum ratio and the linear term of the applied voltage ( X 1 2 X2) had a significant effect on methane production due to the p-values of 0.0054 and 0.0501, respectively, and the F-values of 14.204 and 5.311, respectively. Other linear terms, quadratic terms and interaction effects between the three factors were determined as insignificant (p > 0.05). Consequently, the methane generation could be expressed by the following equation: (5) Y = 14976.7 − 4935.4 X 1 − 2959.7 X 1 2 X 2 As shown in Table 3, the regression coefficient (R2) of 0.8377 shows a satisfactory fit between the experimental data and the empirical model. Fig. 1, for instance, depicts the calculated cumulative methane potential versus the predicted values."
11,Effect of process parameters on hydrogen generation,"3.2 Effect of process parameters on hydrogen generation Fig. 2 shows the profiles for the predicted values and desirability for hydrogen production. Based on the desirability function, optimum conditions, resulting in a maximum hydrogen generation of 1736 mL were reached at a substrate to inoculum ratio of 1.5, a 4 cm- electrode spacing and an applied voltage of 0.6 V. Three-dimensional response surface plots were used to assess the effect of the three selected parameters where one of them was kept at its optimum value and the two others were varied within the experimental range as shown in Fig. 3 . The two response surface plots shown in Fig. 3a and b had an obvious peak, suggesting that the maximum hydrogen potential could be determined inside the experimental boundaries [12]. The substrate to inoculum ratio is a key parameter affecting the course of the anaerobic digestion process and, thus, hydrogen formation. Fig. 3a illustrates the interactive effect of the substrate to inoculum ratio and the electrode distance at constant applied voltage (0.6 V). The RSM indicated that the H2 potential gradually increased with higher substrate to inoculum ratio. An increase in the substrate to inoculum ratio from 0.5 to 1.5 caused an increment in hydrogen production from 459.5 mL to 1810.4 mL to 1810.4 mL equivalent to hydrogen yields of 76.08 mL H2/gVSin and 99.93 mL H2/gVSin respectively. Therefore, the high amount of the substrate seems to ensure a fast diffusion of the substrate into the inoculum. In this study, the low S/X ratios (0.5, 1) were found to trigger lower hydrogen productivity. This finding goes beyond previous reports [33,37]. This outcome could be explained by the fact that higher inoculum concentration and deficient substrate availability may lead to enhance a wide variety of hydrogen consuming bacteria activity including alcohol dehydrogenase, homoacetogenes, sulfate and nitrate reducing bacteria, thereby, more of the carbon source would be devoted to secondary metabolic products than to hydrogen. Giving these points it can be concluded that a substrate to inoculum ratio of 1.5 contributes positively to the hydrogen balance in the digester. The inter-electrode distance (from anode to cathode) of the MEC is another crucial parameter affecting hydrogen production from food waste. Electrode distance has a direct effect on electrons transfer between the electrodes. Accordingly, it was defined as a major factor in determining electrochemical process efficiency [38]. Shorter electrode distance decreases the internal resistance solution, which in turn increases bio-hydrogen formation but an appropriate distance should be set to avoid the formation of any short circuit. As depicted in Fig. 3b, hydrogen production rose with the increase in electrode distance from 2 to 4 cm. Accordingly, a maximum hydrogen potential of 1636 mL was achieved at a 4 cm-electrode spacing. Conversely, other studies reported that hydrogen production increases with the decline in electrode distance. Among them, Kadier et al. [39] and Cheng et al. [26] who found that the hydrogen production rate in MEC increased by decreasing the distance between the two electrodes; therein, the optimum electrode spacing for the maximum hydrogen production they achieved was 2 cm. This finding agrees with Onaran et al. [40] who investigated the effect of electrode spacing in a single MEC reactor by varying the distance from 0.3 cm to 1.5 cm and found that the hydrogen volume and the electrode distance were directly proportional at lower distances and inversely proportional at higher distances. For instance, the hydrogen volume they found jumped from 39.77–104.15 mL with increasing the electrode spacing from 0.3 to 0.5 cm to subsequently drop at higher distances. Even so, the results of this study are in line with findings of a previous study [41] which showed that hydrogen formation from acetate rises with the increase in electrode spacing. One reason for beneficial results at higher electrode spacing could be the fast degradation characteristics of food wastes, which result in a high flow rate of protons [42]. Accordingly, the availability of the substrate would limit the transfer of protons and, to avoid the cathode fouling, protons have to travel a large distance. Fig. 3b depicts the variation of hydrogen potential with electrode spacing and the applied voltage at constant S/X (1.5). The quadratic term of the applied voltage has a significant effect on hydrogen generation (Table 3, p < 0.05). Thus the relationship between the voltage and hydrogen generation was not linear. In fact, the addition of electricity to the MEC reactor on one side caused an increase in the potential difference between the anode and the cathode, helping electrons transfer toward the cathode, and on the other side, involved the microbial anode system formation, accelerating the oxidization rate of organic matters [44]. According to the plot in Fig. 3a, hydrogen formation rose from 717 mL to 1384 mL when increasing the voltage from 0.4 V to 0.6 V but a further increase in voltage to 0.8 V reduced the hydrogen production to 1262.6 mL. Apparently, the application of 0.4 V could not deliver enough electrons to neutralize protons raised from food waste degradation to produce hydrogen gas. Specifically, hydrogen formation was limited by accessible electrons at low voltage, generating low volumes of hydrogen gas despite protons’ existence. This finding is in agreement with other researches. Khongkliang et al. [17] reported that the optimum applied voltage in terms of hydrogen production was 0.6 V. Besides, Pham et al. [45] obtained maximum hydrogen recovery efficiency from acetate under an applied voltage of 0.6 V. Similarly, Krishnan [46] achieved the highest hydrogen rate of 2830 mL/L at an applied voltage of 0.5 V among a range of voltages from 0.1 to 0.8 V. According to Krishnan et al. [46], hydrogen production started to drop from 2532 to 1950 mL L−1 when the voltage went up from 0.6 to 0.8 V. Less effective hydrogen performance at higher voltages could have been caused by the inhibition of microbial activity at high voltages, thereby influencing the oxidation process in the anode. Ultimately, an applied voltage of 0.6 V is enough to conduct MEC and is recommended as optimal for hydrogen production in this study. Fig. 3b shows an ellipse chapped counter plot. The interaction of the distance between the two electrodes and the applied voltage was significant (p < 0.05), although the linear term of the applied voltage does not have a significant individual effect on hydrogen generation (p > 0.05). The parameters ‘interaction, shown in Fig. 3b, proved that the electrode distance was effective at lower voltages, whereas the applied voltage was effective at all electrode distances. Overall, the applied voltage becomes more effective on hydrogen generation."
12,Effect of process parameters on methane production,"3.3 Effect of process parameters on methane production Table 5 summarizes organic acids production from MEC reactors effluent. It is clear that the concentration of total VFAs of all reactors is greater than 10 g/L, which could be used for the methane production process. Fig. 4 shows the interaction between the selected factors on methane production from the acetic-effluent. It seems that the substrate to inoculum ratio is the most influential factor on methane production. Fig. 5 shows the profiles for the predicted values and desirability for methane production. Based on the desirability function, optimum conditions resulting in a maximum methane generation of 1612 mL were defined at a substrate to inoculum ratio of 1.25, an electrode distance of 3 cm and an applied voltage of 0.7 V. What is striking about the data in Table 5 is that the acetic acid and butyric acid were the mostly found acids in all runs. Interestingly, it has been previously reported that methane production increases with high butyric acid concentration [31]. According to Table 5, reactors with 3 cm-electrode spacing present a high concentration of butyric acids in comparison with other reactors. On the other hand, acetate is another main VFA and a direct precursor of methane production. A previous study proved a positive relationship between acetate and methane [47]. Our results show that the percentage of acetic acid was high at an electrode distance of 3 cm and thus a maximum methane production was achieved at this particular distancing. Fig. 4a depicts the variation of methane potential with the S/X and the applied voltage in the MEC at a constant distance. The theoretically-highest methane volume would be obtained at 0.7 V. Methane production went up with increasing the voltage from 0.4 V to 0.7 V and then decreased at higher voltages. This was possibly because the metabolic pathway tended to be butyric acid and acetic acid when the applied voltage equals 0.7 V. Recently, Prajapati et al. [19] have reported that the application of high voltages led to a steady rise in the concentration of VFA, mainly valeric acid and butyric acid. In this context, Onaran et al. [40] achieved a maximum VFA content at an applied voltage of 1 V. Also, Cheng et al. [44] reported that the most effective voltage for butyric and acetic acid generation was 0.24 V and 0.48 V."
13,Overall process optimization,"3.4 Overall process optimization Firstly, the responses were optimized individually. The optimum hydrogen production was obtained at an S/X of 1.5, an electrode spacing of 4 cm, and an applied voltage of 0.6 V. The theoretical optimal conditions, resulting in a maximum methane production were predicted at an S/X of 1.25, an electrode spacing of 3 cm, and an applied voltage of 0.7 V. Accordingly, by applying a dual response surface methodology and combining the two responses into a single objective function, as shown in Fig. 6 , the optimum process parameters resulting in maximum hydrogen (1542.3 mL) and methane volumes (1551.5 mL) were expected to occur at an S/X of 1.5, an electrode spacing of 3.5 cm, and an applied voltage of 0.5 V. On the other side, yields were expected to be 85.13 mL H2/gVSin and 364.9 mL CH4/gVSin for hydrogen and methane, respectively. These yields lie within the middle to upper range of hydrogen and methane yields that are obtained from food wastes in literature under mesophilic conditions and without severe pre-treatment of the substrate (e.g. [40–43]. However, it needs to be considered that yields are also significantly influenced by the chemical composition of the food waste which can vary in a wide range between food waste samples [44,45]. In brief, this study confirmed the feasibility of the new hybrid process for the production of hydrogen and methane. Additionally, as there is a lack in the literature on the optimization of an integrated process with two responses, it could be proven that the simultaneous optimization method provides requirements."
14,Changes in pH and organic matter,"3.5 Changes in pH and organic matter The alterations in organic matter and the pH will be briefly analyzed to contextualize and trace the efficiency of the integrated system approach in substrate degradation, and then identify possible bottlenecks. Table S1 provides the characteristics of the DF effluents. In this study, the VS removal efficiency attained a maximum value of 25.64 % similar to Varanasi et al. (2019) [52]. These data corroborated that the dark fermentation was in favor of organic matter releasing from solid to soluble state. Moreover, considerable amounts of VFA were left at the end of the DF with a concentration ranged from 8.49 g/L to 16.33 g/L. The detectible organic acids were predominantly acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and valeric acid. Concerning VFA buildup, the change in pH outputs was also tested and showed a significant drop in almost digesters. More interestingly, Table S1 reports that the ammonia concentration was a non-inhibitory level, as only a concentration greater than 3500 mg/L has been suggested to inhibit dark fermentation [53]. Taken together, the acidogenic microorganisms speedily converted solid organic matter to VFA, leading to the acid condition inside digesters. This phenomenon might explain the fall of the hydrogenogens activity and potentially lead to digester failure. These observations raise the possibility to connect the dark fermentation reactor to a second reactor to further use the DF-effluent rich in volatile fatty acids. Moreover, soluble metabolites content was monitored for MEC effluents to assess the conditions indoors reactors and gain more insight into the performance of the integrated system (Table S2). A slight increase in VS withdrawal efficiency was observed and attained a maximum level of 30.7 % associated with a TVFA fall. Hereafter, the voltage application effectively intensified the microbial activity, accelerated the decomposition and the conversion of organic matters, and thereby improved their consumption. As shown in table S2, the VFA within the MEC effluents producing hydrogen from the liquid fraction of DF mainly included richness of acetate and butyrate and poor amounts of valeric and propionic acids. This metabolic pathway accords with prior reports [5,54,55] and broadly confirms the less performance of butyric acid as electron contributor for hydrogen generation. Meanwhile, propionic acid was straightforwardly converted to acetic acid in the MEC digester. In particular, the decomposed portions of acetate were estimated to be in the range of 2.9 g/L and 7.8 g/L. Nevertheless, the residual butyrate concentrations were greater than that of acetate and alternated between 4 g/L and 10 g/L. As shown in table S2, some reactors revealed a rise in the TVFA amount. This rise likely stemmed from greater VFA production than consumption rates. On the other hand, it has been reported that the posed voltage contributed on the degradation of organic matters, leading to excessive protons [56]. However, the pH values slightly dropped at the end of the MEC experiments compared with those of DF experiments. Accordingly, it was thought that protons generated at the anode by the oxidation of VFA were consumed at the cathode. Consequently, the MEC led to faster consumption of VFA as well as leaving other simple organics. Thus far, the remainder generated from the MEC effluents, can still be consumed with a tertiary treatment in order to realize supplementary organic matter conversion to further recover energy and to meet environmental standards disposal. Table S3 highlights the third reactor performances. What stands out in the table is the total consumption of volatile fatty acids. In other words, the residual VFA applied to the third stage was consumed by methanogens for methane generation. Correspondingly, the pH increased at the end of the third reactor accompany with VFA conversion. Moreover, The VS reduction efficiency was enhanced reaching a maximum value of 82 %. These findings asserted the benefits of combining multiple processes on polishing effluent’s quality and highlighted the importance of each step from present and forthcoming tendencies. Overall, the pH was thought to be a vital sensitive parameter that governs the functioning and the efficiency of any bioreactor. Accordingly, the drop in pH by consequent accumulation of organic acids could be challenging the DF step. Besides, the incomplete substrate conversion observed in the DF reactor threatens the performance of the DF reactor. Therefore, the hydrogen DF step gives the impression to be a pretreatment step able to provide a potential substrate for MEC. It has been already stated that using MEC as a DF post-treatment is more favorable as compared to direct application of complex organic wastes. Additionally, we need to keep in mind that the high hydraulic retention time of the DF could trigger a huge cost investment [57]. Thus, the DF stage might be the bottleneck step for the studied process."
15,Energy recovery through three-stage system,"3.6 Energy recovery through three-stage system In the aspect of energy output the energy yield from the produced hydrogen was 1.08 kJ/gVSin corresponding to 7.76 % of total energy recovery. The methanogenic digester yielded 12.83 kJ/gVSin corresponding to 92.24 % of the total energy recovery. The energy yield from the generated hydrogen was low compared with that from methane as a result of the lower hydrogen yield and energy density based on volume suggesting that the improvement of the energy recovery was still limited in a two-stage hydrogen production process. Thus, the third-stage of methane production played a crucial role in providing a high overall energy yield of the hybrid system. Table 6 highlights a comparison of H2 yields, CH4 yields and total energy yields achieved in the current study with previous studies using two- or three-stage systems. Results from this study are consistent with some previous results but they were quite different from others. The sequential dark fermentation and methanation for hydrogen and methane co-production possessed the easiest operation condition, while gas and energy yields were predominantly still slightly lower than in the proposed three-stage process. In this regard, Nathao et al. [58] achieved yields of 55 mL H2/ gVSin and 94.8 mL CH4/g VSin for hydrogen and methane generation from food wastes, respectively, equivalent to a total energy recovery of 3.96 kJ/gVSin. Similarly Wang et al. [59] achieved an energy yield of 7.42 kJ/gVS through dark fermentation followed by biomethanation. According to Table 6, by coupling dark fermentation, photofermentation (PF) and anaerobic digestion Ghrimie et al. [60] achieved 184 mL H2/ gVS, 99.3 mL CH4/gVSin and 5.55 kJ/gVSin of hydrogen yield, methane yield and energy yield, respectively, treating food wastes. Although these yields are lower in comparison with results of the current study, higher energy yields from DF and Anaerobic Digestion (AD) are also reported, such as in the study of Ding et al. [61] and Yue et al. [10]. High yields were likely achieved due to pretreatment approaches that were applied in these studies and strengthened the hydrolysis and biodegradability of FW thereby enhancing fermentation performances. These kind of pretreatment strategies require an amount of energy and chemicals addition which increases the total production costs [52]. The use of MEC might demand less energy input and costs for unit operation [62]. However, a detailed energy balance and profitability analyses would be necessary for profound evaluation of these complex processes. Further integrated processes have been previously investigated for hydrogen and methane co-generation including a three-stage process of lactate fermentation followed by DF and AD [36], and three-stage DF – Photofermentation – AD-systems [63–65] (Table 6). Overall, the developed three-stage process in this study is promising in respect of gas production performance and energy productivity."
16,Feasability analysis,"3.7 Feasability analysis The present work contends that food wastes are useful for obtaining commercial marks in bioprocesses using laboratory scale system. Therefore, the scaling up of such biotechnologies is a pending task to deal with. Previous works have documented the existence of full scale dark fermentation systems for hydrogen production and concluded that the enhancement of the energetic yields of dark fermentation is mandatory to reduce system costs and provide this technology with excellent application potential [66]. Indeed, Balanchandar et al. [67] promoted a comprehensive approach in moving from lab scale to pilot biohydrogen production from dark fermentation, thereby offering more commercial application opportunities. By conducting a pilot scale, they reached 1.62 folds increase in cumulative hydrogen production when compared to bench scale. Hence, the findings obtained from the current study show promise for future systems, since yields of 85.13 mL H2/gVSin and 364.9 mL CH4/gVSin can pave the way for the commercial production of hydrogen and methane using an upscale system. However, this combined process is still at its early stage, and its commercial applicability is limited. In particular, the MEC up-scaling might be challenging, especially when considering short electrode distances and high feedstock volumes. Likewise, the main challenges for methanogenesis reactor are the requirement of different media as well as the microbial growth is not constant. Besides, a high demand for the maintenance and appropriate operation of the three-stage system should be taken in consideration for the whole process. Therefore, comprehensive future studies would be necessary to authenticate the high performance of the hybrid system under bench-scale conditions and in continuous operation mode, and to subsequently up-scale the three-stage system. Moreover, process control and monitoring hold a great potential to make this system advance on its road to practical application. Further investigation is essential in the operational control of the process to understand the intricate relationships between the numerous parameters and factors that affect the whole process, and therefore overcome the bottlenecks. Finally, if the productivities proved herein can be successfully attained in a pilot scale, later biorefineries will obviously benefit from covering the proposed process."
17,Conclusion,"The present study was undertaken to design a novel process for the conversion of food wastes into two biofuels, namely hydrogen and methane, and optimize its productivity. In this regard a three-stage process for food waste valorization through sequential dark fermentation, microbial electrolysis cell, and biomethanation was successfully operated, with emphasis on reaching high hydrogen and methane production yields. Furthermore, the substrate to inoculum ratio, applied voltage, as well as electrode distance has proved to be vital factors to enhance the process productivity. Accordingly, statistical optimization using response surface methodology was conducted to determine optimum conditions in terms of hydrogen and methane potentials. Results have shown that combining a substrate to inoculum ratio of 1.5, a MEC voltage of 0.5 V, and an electrode distance of 3.5 cm, the highest hydrogen yield (85.13 mL H2/gVSin) and methane yield (364.9 mL CH4/gVSin) were reached, corresponding to an energy yield of 13.91 kJ/gVSin. On the other side, results showed that the interaction between the applied voltage and the anode-cathode spacing had a significant effect on hydrogen production. As well a significant interaction between the substrate to inoculum ratio and the applied voltage on methane generation was observed. Hence, it seems that parameters interact with each other, impacting process’s efficacy. Besides, this study attempted also to investigate the organic matter consumption through the three-stage and showed an impressive polishing effluent quality. Furthermore, High process performance reveals that the three-stage system could provide a promising new path for biological hydrogen and methane formation using food wastes. There is a definite need for further investigation on energetic and economic feasibility, continuous operation and up-scaling of the developed process. Hence, a full modeling control and simulation study are required to more understand the process, overcome its bottlenecks, and envisage its scale up."
