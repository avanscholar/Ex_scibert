0,Introduction,"Solar energy is sustainable and more abundant than other energy resources. High-performance nanostructured material is essential for sunlight-driven hydrogen fuel production through water splitting and quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells. Hundreds of inorganic photocatalytic materials have been synthesized since the famous study of photocatalytic water splitting using a TiO2 electrode was reported by Japanese scientists Fujishima and Honda in 1972 [1]. The applications of these materials in energy and environmental fields, such as the photocatalytic hydrogen fuel production from water, quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells, air and water purification, photocatalytic antibiosis and organic synthesis, have been investigated extensively [2–6]. Photocatalytic material has become one of the most active fields of current international academia. Developing visible-light-activated, inexpensive, efficient, and chemically stable photocatalysts is a challenge. The semiconductor TiO2 is affordable and safe and has characteristically high photocatalytic activity and strong oxidation capabilities and is thus considered the most applicable photocatalytic material. However, with a wide band gap of 3.2eV, the TiO2 semiconductor can absorb only ultraviolet (UV) light at wavelengths lower than 387nm, and only 3–5% of incoming sunlight meets these requirements. Therefore, TiO2 utilizes solar energy inefficiently. Additionally, only a small number of photo-generated electrons and holes migrate to the surface of the photocatalyst due to the recombination loss of the photo-generated carriers in the TiO2 nanostructure, leading to a variety of catalytic oxidation and reduction processes [7–10]. These two factors have limited the application of the TiO2 photocatalyst. Scientists have employed a variety of methods for bulk and surface modifications to extend TiO2 light response and improve photocatalytic activity with some success. Many studies on metal-doped TiO2 have been conducted to improve the photocatalytic degradation rate of organic pollutants under UV and visible irradiation. The doping metals used included Fe, Sn, Pt and other transition metal ions [11–14]. Because transition metal ions contain multiple valence states, doping transition metal ions into the TiO2 lattice was equivalent to the introduction of defects, which acted as shallow traps for photo-generated electrons and holes resulting in extended recombination time and improved photocatalytic activity. Non-metal doping systems included N–, C–, S–, and F-doped TiO2 [15–18]. Non-metal doping enabled the excitation of TiO2 by visible irradiation. However, the origin of photocatalytic activity under visible irradiation has not been understood completely. Possible reasons for the visible light response include a narrowed band gap, an isolated band formed above the valence band, and oxygen vacancy defects and Ti3+ color centers [15,19,20]. Photocatalytic performance was also improved through the deposition of noble metal nanoparticles on the TiO2 surface. Pt, Ag, and Au have been studied widely [21–23]. Photo-generated electrons are captured easily by molecular oxygen on the surface of the noble metal. Schotky barriers formed at the TiO2 and noble metal interface may serve as shallow electron trapping sites and inhibit the combination of photo-generated electrons and holes. Metal doping, non-metal doping and noble metal deposition can improve the photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 photocatalyst to some extent. However, the disadvantage of the above three modifications is that the performance of the photocatalyst typically is related to the synthesis procedure and doping concentration. Syntheses were not reproducible in many cases. Sensitization is another method that is often used for TiO2 modification and that would extend the TiO2 light response range, induce visible light excitation and improve the overall efficiency of charge separation and photocatalytic activity [24–27]. Inorganic semiconductor quantum dots compared with organic dye sensitizers have a higher light absorption coefficient, an increased stability towards photobleaching, the potential for multi-electron excitation and the ability to adjust absorption wavelengths over a wide range by varying quantum dot sizes. Common semiconductor nanocomposite systems included TiO2/CdS, TiO2/CdSe and TiO2/PbS. Poor narrow band gap semiconductor chemical and photochemical stabilities limited the application of these TiO2-based nanocomposites in areas, such as antibiosis and environmental pollution control. However, TiO2-based nanocomposites are uniquely advantageous for photocatalytic hydrogen production through water splitting and quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells. CdS has been studied extensively as a visible light-activated photocatalyst. However, low photocatalytic efficiency and corrosion were reported for CdS without sacrificial reagents. CdS has typically been combined with wide-band-gap semiconductors or embedded into inorganic porous or layered materials to improve photocatalytic activity and stability. TiO2/CdS is a typical nanocomposite system [10,28–34]. The optical response region of the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite photocatalyst encompassed nearly all of the visible and UV regions. TiO2 normally was used to support CdS nanoparticles in the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite. The separation effect of TiO2 improved the dispersion of CdS nanoparticles, and therefore, a higher specific surface area and more active sites were obtained. Finally, the conduction band of CdS is more negative than that of TiO2. Photo-generated electrons in the CdS conduction band transfer to the TiO2 conduction band while photo-generated holes remain in the CdS valence band as a result of the potential gradient at the interface between the two semiconductors. The recombination between photo-generated electrons and holes was suppressed as a result of the separation effect, and thus, the energy conversion efficiency and overall photocatalytic activity would be improved. The TiO2/CdS nanocomposite, which exhibits CdS visible light absorption characteristics, TiO2 UV absorption characteristics, the support effect and the interfacial charge separation effect, has positive research value and applicability in the photocatalysis and photovoltaic industry. The authors have designed and synthesized the nanocomposite material [35,36] and currently focus on the microstructure and performance of the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite. The latest research progress on the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite, the TiO2/CdS-based multiple nanocomposite, and the interfacial charge transfer between TiO2 and CdS were introduced in this work."
1,TiO2/CdS nanocomposite powder,"A TiO2/CdS nanocomposite powder was prepared and used as a photocatalyst. The photocatalytic properties of the powder were reported closely related to the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite microstructure. The TiO2 and CdS morphology nanostructures and the contact area and interaction between the TiO2 and CdS phases affected the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite powder photocatalytic activity and stability. The ideal structure of TiO2/CdS nanocomposites requires that CdS quantum dots are dispersed uniformly on the surface of the TiO2 support, which would avoid the aggregation of CdS nanoparticles and improve the contact area and photocatalytic activity. Scientists developed a variety of synthesis methods to prepare the high-performance TiO2/CdS nanocomposite powder, including chemical bath deposition [37–55], bifunctional organic molecule linking [56–60], one-step synthesis [61–68], physical mixing [69,70], reverse micelles [71] and impregnation methods [72,73]."
2,Chemical bath deposition,"2.1 Chemical bath deposition Chemical bath deposition (CBD) is the simplest and most common synthesis method used for the preparation of TiO2/CdS nanocomposite powder. A two-step process was developed during CBD. A TiO2 nanostructure with a specific morphology was prepared first and then immersed into solutions containing Cd2+ and S2 −. The formation rate of CdS was controlled carefully during synthesis. Bai et al. [37] synthesized and dispersed TiO2 nanotubes into an aqueous solution of thiourea. Then, a CdCl2 aqueous solution was added gradually. TiO2/CdS nanocomposite powder was obtained by refluxing the mixture at 60°C. The authors varied the mass ratios of TiO2 and CdS and studied the activity and stability of the nanocomposite. CdS was found to exhibit a hexagonal phase, and the dispersion of CdS onto the surface of the TiO2 nanotube significantly affected the degradation efficiency of pollutants. Zhu et al. [38] prepared a bamboo-like TiO2/CdS nanocomposite in a tetrahydrofuran solution using TiO2 nanotubes as a support, CdSO4 and pure sulfur powder as CdS precursors, and excess KBH4 as a reductant. CdS nanoparticles were formed inside the TiO2 nanotubes. The bamboo-like TiO2/CdS nanocomposite exhibited much higher photocatalytic activity in the degradation of dye under visible irradiation. Cao et al. [39] employed a similar chemical reduction method for the preparation of a TiO2/CdS core/sheath heterostructure nanowire. The authors found that the thickness of the CdS sheath could be controlled by the precursor concentration, and a possible multi-site growth mechanism was proposed. CdS nanoparticles in another study were formed on TiO2 nanosheets by immersing Pt/TiO2 nanosheets in Cd(NO3)2 and Na2S alcohol solutions successively [40]. The morphology of TiO2 was found to greatly influence the hydrogen production rate under visible irradiation. The highest apparent quantum efficiency at a wavelength of 420nm reached 13.9%, and no significant losses in photocatalytic activity and photocorrosion were observed. Li et al. [41] also studied the photocatalytic performance of the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite via water splitting under visible irradiation. Titanate nanotubes with different pore diameters were dispersed in a Cd(Ac)2 solution for ion exchange, and the sulfurization process was performed using thiourea at a moderate temperature. The apparent quantum yield for hydrogen production reached approximately 43.4% under visible light near 420nm. Zhang et al. [42] reported a similar method. The TiO2/CdS nanocomposite was prepared via ion exchange and a subsequent sulfurization process. CdS nanoparticles were formed simultaneously with the conversion of titanate nanotubes into TiO2 nanotubes. The TiO2/CdS nanocomposite in the work of Li et al. [43] was prepared by preplanting CdO as crystal seeds into ordered mesoporous TiO2 and then converting CdO to CdS quantum dots through ion exchange. The TiO2/CdS photocatalyst was used in the oxidation of NO gas in air and the degradation of organic pollutants in an aqueous solution. TiO2 was used in most cases as the support material for the dispersion of CdS quantum dots, while CdS was selected as the support material and modified using TiO2 nanoparticles in a few studies. Jang et al. [44] reported a TiO2/CdS nanocomposite photocatalyst consisting of bulk CdS decorated with TiO2 nanoparticles. The photocatalytic activity for simultaneous hydrogen production and decomposition of H2S dissolved in alkaline water was examined, indicating that hydrogen originated from both H2S and H2O. Jang et al. [45] in another study synthesized CdS nanowires using a solvothermal method and modified CdS with TiO2 nanoparticles using a sol–gel method and hydrothermal treatment to improve the crystallization and contact between the two phases. The TiO2/CdS nanocomposite exhibited high photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production from water containing sulfide and sulfite as hole scavengers. The improvement in photocatalytic activity was ascribed to the efficient interfacial charge separation caused by the unique configuration of the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite. Researchers employed different methods to control the CdS formation rate and optimize the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite photocatalyst microstructure in the above CBD method. For example, thiourea was used rather than Na2S as a precursor of CdS; KBH4 was used as a reductant to control the concentration of S2−; TiO2 was alternately immersed in two precursor solutions; the location and concentration of Cd2+ was controlled by the replacement of Na+ in titanate via ion exchange; CdO was embedded into a TiO2 matrix during synthesis to improve dispersion and avoid the aggregation of CdS nanoparticles."
3,Bifunctional organic molecule linking,"2.2 Bifunctional organic molecule linking The size and dispersion of CdS quantum dots in the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite prepared by direct chemical precipitation are difficult to control. A new strategy to solve this problem was developed in which CdS quantum dots were tethered to the surface of TiO2 through bifunctional molecular linkers. The TiO2/CdS nanocomposite prepared using this method contains strong covalent bonds and interactions, which ensure the even dispersion of CdS quantum dots and the high efficiency of interfacial electron transfer from the CdS nanoparticles to the TiO2 matrix. Kim et al. [56] synthesized TiO2 nanotubes and CdS nanoparticles separately and used 2,3-dimercapto-succinic acids (DMSA), which contain two thiol groups and two carboxylic acid groups at each terminus, as the bifunctional molecular linkers. Strong Ti–O–C bonds were formed as a result of hydroxyl group reactions with DMSA carboxylic acid groups on the TiO2 surface. Moreover, CdS quantum dots are bonded with DMSA thiol groups. Zhou et al. [57] prepared a TiO2/CdS nanocomposite using thiolactic acid as a bifunctional molecular linker. A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image showed CdS quantum dots deposited on the outer surface of the TiO2 nanotube. Remarkable photocatalytic activity and stability were observed. Qian et al. [58] reported similar results, wherein a mesoporous TiO2 substrate and mercaptopropionic acid as a bifunctional linking molecule were selected to disperse and stabilize CdS quantum dots. The TiO2/CdS nanocomposite with a bifunctional linking molecule exhibited higher photocatalytic activity and a lower loss ratio than TiO2/CdS prepared using a direct CBD method. Cysteine was also used with the thiol and carboxylic acid groups as a bifunctional linking molecule. It should be noted that the microstructure of the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite might be affected due to the oxidative decomposition of the bifunctional molecule linkers during the photocatalytic reaction."
4,One-step synthesis,"2.3 One-step synthesis The two methods mentioned above are both two-step syntheses. Researchers have developed simple one-step hydrothermal (solvothermal) and sol–gel syntheses in which TiO2 and CdS were prepared simultaneously. Ding et al. [61] reported a one-step high-temperature solvothermal method for the synthesis of a TiO2/sulfide nanocomposite. The TiO2/CdS nanocomposite was synthesized at 350°C with Ti(OBu)4 and CdSO4 as precursors and ethanol as a solvent. The authors ascribed the superior visible-light-driven photocatalytic efficiency to the effective heterointerface and high crystallinity. A one-step hydrothermal method was often used for CdS/titanate nanotube syntheses. Chen et al. [62] reported the one-step hydrothermal synthesis of CdS/titanate nanotubes using TiO2, Cd(NO3)2 and thioacetamide as precursors. Researchers confirmed the effective dispersion of CdS nanoparticles, intimate multipoint contacts between CdS and titanate nanotubes and high apparent quantum yield for hydrogen production. Kukovecz et al. [63] used a similar one-step hydrothermal method, in which a cadmium ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid complex (Cd-EDTA) was introduced into the synthesis system to control the formation rate of CdS. The advantage of one-step synthesis is the intimate contact between TiO2 and CdS due to simultaneous formation."
5,Microstructure and application,"2.4 Microstructure and application Fig. 1 shows TEM images of the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite in the literature, where the microstructures of TiO2 in the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite consisted primarily of nanotube, nanowire and mesoporous architectures. CdS existed in the form of quantum dots and dispersed on the surface of nanotubes and nanowires, inside the nanotubes and within the mesopores of the TiO2 support. One-dimensional nanostructures, nanotubes and nanowires have larger surface areas, high sedimentation rates and charge transport capabilities. Additionally, the tubular morphology of nanotubes limits the radial growth of CdS nanoparticles and facilitates the migration of reactants and reactive species in a photocatalytic reaction. Mesoporous TiO2 also has a large specific surface area and contains more reactive sites. The mesoporous structure provides a rigid template for the growth and stability of CdS quantum dots. The continuous pore structure of mesoporous TiO2 facilitates the migration of reactants and reactive species in a photocatalytic reaction. Moreover, mesoporous TiO2 may absorb photons through multiple scattering. The TiO2/CdS nanocomposite powder was used primarily as a visible light photocatalyst for the degradation of organic pollutants and photocatalytic hydrogen production from water. The photocatalytic activity of the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite powder reported in the literature was compared, as presented in Table 1. Numerous studies indicated that the photocatalytic activity of the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite was superior to TiO2 and CdS individually under the same conditions. The photocatalytic performance of the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite is related to its microstructure and synthesis methods. Target pollutants included organic dyes, such as rhodamine B (RhB), methylene blue (MB), methyl orange (MO), and some small molecules, such as 4-chlorophenol (4-CP). Pt co-catalyst and sacrificial reagents, such as sodium sulfite/sulfide significantly improved the hydrogen production efficiency of the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite in photocatalytic water splitting. Because CdS quantum dots may be lost due to photocorrosion during the photocatalytic reaction, the measurement of stability through recycling experiments was an important part of the performance studies. The results indicated that the TiO2 support improved the stability of CdS quantum dots and reduced the loss ratio."
6,TiO2/CdS nanocomposite film,"The TiO2/CdS nanocomposite film was prepared by loading CdS quantum dots as inorganic sensitizers onto TiO2 nanostructures, which are grown or deposited directly on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) or Ti-conductive electrodes. The TiO2/CdS nanocomposite film has strong absorption in the visible region. Varying the size of the CdS quantum dots can control the absorption of the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite film. Additionally, the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite film was typically used as a photoelectrode in the photoelectrochemical cell and has also been developed into a new type of solar cell, that is, a quantum-dot-sensitized solar cell, as a result of the ideal band gap and conduction band potential of CdS [74]. Similar to the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite powder, the photocatalytic performance and the photoelectrical conversion efficiency of the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite film are related to the microstructure [75]. The CdS deposition methods can be divided into in situ and ex situ syntheses. The in situ synthesis included chemical bath deposition [76–107], electrodeposition [108–113], photodeposition [114,115], chemical vapor deposition [116,117] and spray pyrolysis deposition [118]. High surface coverage of CdS quantum dots on the TiO2 support, efficient charge transfer due to the direct contact between CdS quantum dots and the TiO2 support, and a wide size distribution of CdS quantum dots typically was reported for a TiO2/CdS nanocomposite film prepared using in situ synthesis. The pre-synthesized monodispersed CdS quantum dots in the ex situ synthesis were deposited on the TiO2 support directly or via linker molecules [119–122]. The size and size distribution of the CdS quantum dots can be controlled precisely, and the CdS quantum dot coverage is typically less than the monolayer coverage. However, the introduction of bifunctional organic linker molecules complicated the interfacial charge transfer from the CdS quantum dots to the TiO2 substrate, which may also cause adverse effects to the light absorption and charge separation processes."
7,Successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction,"3.1 Successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction CBD is the most widely used synthesis method for the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite powder as mentioned above. Researchers developed an improved chemical deposition method for the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite film called successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) or sequential chemical bath deposition (S-CBD) to slow the deposition rate and control the loading of CdS quantum dots. The precursors of CdS in this method were dissolved and placed into two separate beakers; first, the TiO2 electrode was dipped into a solution containing Cd2+, rinsed with the solvent, dipped into another solution containing S2- and rinsed again with the solvent. The deposition process was repeated several times to obtain a suitable loading amount of CdS. SILAR, or S-CBD, is the most widely used method for the simultaneous synthesis and deposition of CdS quantum dots onto the TiO2 film. Baker et al. [76] prepared the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite film using the SILAR method with CdSO4 and Na2S as CdS precursors. They found that the SILAR method facilitated the size control of the CdS quantum dots. Maximum incident photo-to-charge carrier efficiencies of 55% and 26% were measured for CdS-sensitized TiO2 nanotubes and nanoparticulate architectures, respectively. Wu et al. [77] reported the synthesis of CdS-sensitized TiO2 nanowires. TiO2 nanowires obtained via a Ti substrate thermal oxidation treatment were immersed successively in aqueous solutions of Cd(NO3)2 and Na2S for the loading of CdS quantum dots. The photocurrent density suggested effective performance for photocatalytic application and hydrogen production. Highly ordered TiO2 nanotube films in the work of Sun et al. [78] were modified with CdS quantum dots via the S-CBD method. The significant photocurrent and cell efficiency (4.15%) confirmed the promising application of the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite film in a solar cell. Lee et al. [79] prepared a CdS/CdSe co-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrode using the S-CBD method with Cd(NO3)2 and Na2S as CdS precursors. The further deposition of the ZnS layer improved the hydrogen evolution rate. Zhou et al. [80] studied the influence of cationic precursors on the deposition rate of the CdS quantum dots and the performance of the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite film prepared using the SILAR method. Two cationic precursors, Cd(NO3)2 and Cd(Ac)2, were compared. A higher deposition rate and better photoelectrical conversion efficiency was achieved when Cd(Ac)2 was used in the synthesis. Wang et al. [81] showed that a TiO2 nanorod array grown on transparent conductive glass was modified with CdS quantum dots via the S-CBD method using Cd(NO3)2 and Na2S as precursors, indicating that the photoelectrochemical properties of a CdS-sensitized TiO2 nanorod array were comparable to those of the commonly used CdS-sensitized TiO2 nanotube array. Cheng et al. [82] reported the synthesis of CdS-sensitized TiO2 inverse opals using the SILAR method. The three-dimensional periodical pore structure of the TiO2 inverse opals provided a high surface area for CdS loading and electron transport path. Researchers have introduced sonication and microwaves into the synthesis process in addition to the conventional CBD. Xie et al. [83] developed a sonication-assisted sequential chemical bath deposition method in which TiO2 electrodes were immersed successively in precursor solution during sonication. Sonication promoted the diffusion of precursors inside the TiO2 nanotubes and avoided the clogging of CdS quantum dots at the mouth of the TiO2 nanotubes. Enhanced photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic activities were observed for this sonication-assisted technique. Zhu et al. [84] introduced microwave irradiation into the synthesis and developed a microwave-assisted chemical bath deposition method. Microwave irradiation led to the rapid deposition and intimate contacts between the CdS quantum dots and the TiO2 substrate."
8,Electrodeposition and photodeposition,"3.2 Electrodeposition and photodeposition The deposition process in the SILAR method was divided into several reaction cycles to slow the deposition rate and control CdS loading. However, rapid deposition when using aqueous precursor solutions resulted in the clogging of CdS quantum dots at the mouth of the TiO2 nanotubes, which was unfavorable for the diffusion of precursors into the TiO2 nanotubes and the formation of CdS quantum dots inside the TiO2 nanotubes. Additionally, the process was time-consuming because it required repeated immersion and washing steps. Electrodeposition and photodeposition were also reported for the synthesis of the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite film. The formation of CdS quantum dots in electrodeposition and photodeposition occurred via an electrochemical and photochemical process, respectively. Therefore, varying the applied potential value or the light irradiation intensity can control the deposition rate of CdS. Banerjee et al. [108] prepared CdS quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotubes using the electrodeposition method with CdCl2 and Na2S2O3 as precursors. A solution temperature of 70°C and an applied potential of -0.65 V versus a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were found to be the best conditions for a rapid and controlled deposition. Yu et al. [109] reported an in situ constant current electrodeposition method for the synthesis of CdS quantum dot-sensitized hierarchical TiO2. Electrodeposition was completed at 90°C with a current density of 0.5mAcm− 2. Cd(NO3)2 and thiourea were used as precursors of CdS and 1/1 (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/water was used as a solvent. The authors believed that the in situ electrodeposition ensured a high surface coverage of TiO2 and direct attachment between the CdS quantum dots and the TiO2 matrix. Shao et al. [110] reported similar electrodeposition. CdS quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays were prepared via one-step electrodeposition in the presence of TiO2 and CdS precursors. Electrodeposition prevented the assembling or clogging of CdS nanoparticles at the mouth of the TiO2 nanotubes and improved the contact area between CdS and TiO2. Furthermore, the size and distribution density of the CdS nanoparticles can be tuned easily by controlling the electrolyte concentration. Liu et al. [111] introduced sonication into the electrodeposition process and developed a sonoelectrochemical deposition method. The sonication-assisted synthesis improved the combination between the CdS and TiO2 nanotubes as well as the dispersion and stability of the CdS nanoparticles. Jin-nouchi et al. [114] reported a photodeposition technique for the preparation of the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite film. The in situ photodeposition process was completed in an ethanol solution of S8 and Cd(ClO4)2 under UV irradiation. Additionally, the SILAR and self-assembled monolayer methods were studied for comparison. The results of Jin-nouchi et al. [114] indicated that the CdS quantum dots were distributed in the mesopores of the TiO2 film without pore-blocking in the photodeposition sample and with partial pore-blocking in the SILAR sample, whereas only the upper portion of the film is covered with the CdS quantum dots in the self-assembled monolayer sample. Other advantages of photodeposition included the ability to control the particle size and loading of CdS quantum dots by irradiation time and the efficient charge transfer between CdS and TiO2 due to the photocatalytic formation of the heteronanojunction."
9,Other synthesis methods,"3.3 Other synthesis methods CBD, electrodeposition and photodeposition are within the scope of solution methods. The interfacial charge transfer from the CdS quantum dots to TiO2 in the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite film prepared using these solution-based deposition methods may be affected negatively by the chemical species at the interface between CdS and TiO2. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) provides an interfacial method for the direct growth of a CdS sensitizer on a TiO2 substrate. Compact physical contact and increased loading of CdS quantum dots typically were reported in the CVD method. For example, CdS and CdSe nanorods were deposited onto TiO2 nanorod arrays by CVD based on a vapor-solid process with CdS and CdSe powders as precursors in Luo et al. [116]. Lee et al. [117] reported the growth of CdS nanorod-coated-TiO2 nanowires on conductive glass using the CVD method. Other methods, such as spray pyrolysis deposition, have also been used for the preparation of a TiO2/CdS nanocomposite film. A mixture solution containing CdCl2 and thiourea in Hwang et al. [119] was sprayed onto a mesoporous TiO2 film heated on a hot plate, and deep yellow CdS quantum dots were formed with the increase in spraying time."
10,Microstructure and application,"3.4 Microstructure and application A TiO2 film with one-dimensional or mesoporous structures has advantages in terms of surface area and interfacial charge transfer as mentioned above. Therefore, TiO2 nanotubes, TiO2 nanorods, mesoporous TiO2 and TiO2 inverse opals typically were selected supports for CdS quantum dots in the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite film. TiO2 nanotube arrays were prepared using electrochemical anodization of a Ti substrate. The length, orientation and diameter of the nanotubes can be tuned by controlling electrochemical reaction conditions. TiO2 inverse opals with a three-dimensional periodical pore structure offered a high specific surface area and porosity for CdS loading and facilitated electron transport and light trapping due to multiscattering. Fig. 2 shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite film in the literature. Well-ordered nanorod arrays, nanotube arrays and inverse structures were observed in Fig. 2. The CdS nanoparticles were deposited on the inner and outer surfaces of the TiO2 nanotubes and TiO2 opal and on the top of the TiO2 nanorods and nanotubes. The TiO2/CdS nanocomposite film was used primarily as an electrode in a photoelectrochemical cell for photoelectrical water splitting and in quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells. The photocatalytic activity and photoelectric properties of the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite film reported in the literature were compared, as presented in Tables 2 and 3. Photocatalytic water splitting in the photoelectrochemical cell provides an ideal method for hydrogen fuel production. Sensitized solar cells are considered alternatives to silicon-based solar cells and other semiconductor photovoltaic devices Quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells in contrast to dye-sensitized solar cells have the advantages of a tunable band gap, high extinction coefficients and improved stability. Though the power conversion efficiency of quantum dot-sensitized solar cells has grown rapidly to over 4% in the past few years, the efficiency remains much lower than that of dye-sensitized solar cells (11–12%) and requires further optimization [109,123–125]. The photoelectric performance of the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite film was typically evaluated using incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and power conversion efficiency (PCE). Researchers indicated that IPCE, PCE and the photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 photoelectrode increased significantly after modification with CdS quantum dots. The microstructure and synthesis method significantly influenced the photoelectric properties of the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite film."
11,TiO2/CdS-based multiple nanocomposite,"The composite of different semiconductors may facilitate the charge separation and transfer because of the formation of a potential gradient at the interface between different nanostructures. Other components were added and a variety of TiO2/CdS-based multiple nanocomposites were developed to further improve the photocatalytic properties of the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite [126–144]. Kim et al. [126] reported a ternary hybrid of CdS/TiO2/WO3. The TiO2/WO3 binary hybrid was first synthesized using a sol–gel method, and then CdS quantum dots were deposited onto the TiO2/WO3 binary hybrid using the CBD method with Na2S and Cd(Ac)2 as precursors. The photoreduction of polyoxometalate and photocurrent tests indicated that the photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical activities of the CdS/TiO2/WO3 ternary hybrid were much higher than those of the bare CdS and any binary hybrids. The enhancement in activity was ascribed to the cascadal electron transfer from CdS to TiO2 to WO3 through the interfacial potential gradient. The authors believed that such a cascadal electron transfer in the hybrid structure facilitated charge separation and retarded charge recombination. TiO2/CdS in Zhao et al. [127] was loaded on activated carbon fibers using a dip-coating method. The ternary hybrid showed enhanced activity for the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue. Meng et al. [128] reported the synthesis of a fullerene modified TiO2/CdS nanocomposite. The delocalized conjugated electronic structure and electron-accepting ability of fullerene were believed favorable to the interfacial charge separation. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was attributed to the increase in specific surface area and photo-absorption as well as the cooperative effect of CdS and fullerene. Wu et al. [129] designed and fabricated a triple heterojunction of CdS/TiO2/BDD. The TiO2 nanotubes were grown on p-type boron-doped diamond (BDD), and then the CdS nanoparticles were assembled onto the surface of TiO2 and BDD using S-CBD. The triple heterojunction showed a 36.5% improvement in the initial photocurrent and a 78% reduction in the photocorrosion rate in contrast to the TiO2/CdS single heterojunction. The authors believed that TiO2 acted as acceptor for photogenerated electrons, while BDD acted as a sink for photogenerated holes. The charge transfer in the triple heterojunction promoted charge separation and led to an enhanced photocurrent and remarkably inhibited photocorrosion. Lv et al. [130] reported the synthesis of CdS–TiO2-chemically reduced graphene oxide (RGO) composites. RGO in this TiO2/CdS-based multiple system acted as an electron acceptor and transport material. The introduction of RGO improved the photocatalytic activity of TiO2/CdS due to the increase in specific surface area, the adsorption of the substrate and the reduction of charge recombination. White et al. [131] prepared a multiple nanocomposite of Pt/TiO2/CdS/zeolite Y. The zeolite-based assembly promoted a statistical colocalization of the three nanoparticles. The new components in the TiO2/CdS-based multiple nanocomposites introduced above can be divided into an inert component and an active component. Activated carbon fiber and zeolite Y were inert components, and they were used as adsorbents or supports and were not involved directly in the charge separation and transfer process. Meanwhile, WO3, fullerene, BDD and RGO were active components. WO3 and BDD are inorganic semiconductors. WO3 in the TiO2/CdS-based nanocomposite acted as an electron acceptor, while BDD acted as a sink for photo-generated holes. The positions of the semiconductor valence and conduction bands should match so that a potential gradient could form at the interface to promote the separation and transfer of photo-generated electrons and holes. Fullerene and graphene belong to the carbon family. They act as electron acceptors and transport materials because of the well-known delocalized conjugated structure."
12,Interfacial charge transfer,"The interfacial charge transfer between CdS and TiO2 is shown in Fig. 3. The processes include (1) electron injection from the excited CdS quantum dots to TiO2, (2) electron transport and collection, (3) electron trapping, (4) recombination of electrons and holes, (5) electron reactions with species in the electrolyte, and (6) hole reactions with species in the electrolyte [109,145]. The mechanism and kinetics of the excited-state interfacial charge transfer and energy conversion efficiency are influenced greatly by CdS quantum dot size, surface functionalization and the interface between donor and acceptor nanostructures. Related research achievements in recent years are introduced below [146–151]. Blackburn et al. [146] studied the electron transfer dynamics in the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite prepared using the S-CBD method. The transient absorption dynamics were found to be multiexponential. A comparison of the transient absorption dynamics for TiO2/CdS and ZrO2/CdS in the visible and mid-IR regions indicated that electron transfer occurred on a time scale of approximately 10–50ps. Another work showed that a time-resolved microwave conductivity technique was used to investigate charge injection from CdS into TiO2 in the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite [147]. The authors confirmed that efficient electron injection from CdS quantum dots to TiO2 produced long-lived charge carriers. The quantum yield for electron injection into TiO2 per photon absorbed by the CdS sensitizer was near unity. Tachibana et al. [148] studied the controlling parameters in charge recombination kinetics at the interface of TiO2/CdS using sub-microsecond to millisecond transient absorption. The transient absorption spectra suggested an efficient electron injection from CdS to TiO2. Charge recombination kinetics for TiO2/CdS appear multiexponential, similar to the transient absorption dynamics observed for dye-sensitized TiO2. A detailed analysis of the charge recombination dynamics using nonadiabatic electron transfer theory revealed that the recombination half time correlated with the crystallinity size of CdS. Excited-state electron transfer from CdS quantum dots to TiO2 via molecular linkers was studied in addition to direct electron transfer. Chain length and molecular linker properties influenced excited-state deactivation and interfacial electron transfer. Dibbell et al. [149] prepared the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite using mercaptoalkanoic acid as bifunctional molecular linkers. Varying the chain length of the mercaptoalkanoic acid controlled the interparticle separation between CdS and TiO2. Electron injection and interfacial charge recombination were investigated using steady-state emission quenching, nanosecond time-resolved emission, and nanosecond transient absorption. The electron injection yield decreased with increasing chain length and interparticle separation. Electron injection occurred on multiple time scales. A fast component (<10− 8 s) accounted for the majority of injections, while the remainder occurred on the microsecond time scale. Interfacial charge recombination occurred on the microsecond time scale, and the kinetics were independent of chain length. Bifunctional phenylene-containing linkers were used by Dibbell et al. [150] to improve the electronic coupling of CdS and TiO2. Electron injection through 4-mercaotobenzoic acid occurred on multiple time scales, with faster component (<10− 8 s) and slower components (10− 7–10−6 s). The fast component was approximately as efficient as that through short-chain mercaptoalkanoic acid."
13,Conclusion,"TiO2/CdS nanocomposites are members of a class of materials with potential applications in the photocatalysis and photovoltaic industry. Improvements to TiO2/CdS nanocomposite photocatalytic and photoelectric performance are a challenge. The photocatalytic performance of nanostructured materials is closely related to microstructure and surface properties. Therefore, synthesis method development and microstructure optimization are expected to further improve the photoelectric properties and power conversion efficiency of the TiO2/CdS nanocomposite. Additionally, further extensive studies on the charge transfer processes would provide useful guidance for the design and preparation of TiO2/CdS nanocomposites."
