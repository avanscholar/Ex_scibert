0,Introduction,"Sustainable catalysis mainly deals with the replacement of stoichiometric reagents used in synthetic transformations with catalytic routes to develop greener, and more cost-effective chemical processes. It develops a new avenue to the sustainable production of pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. In recent years first-row transition metal-based catalysts have emerged as homogeneous catalysts for (de)hydrogenation and many organic transformations. In the last few decades the homogeneous catalysis transformation is mainly dominated by the noble metals and it has a huge impact on human life. In recent times, the increasing demand and cost of noble metal precursors force us to replace homogeneous catalysts with more abundant and sustainable metal salts for the (de)hydrogenation or related reactions like dehydrogenative coupling or hydrogen borrowing reactions. Thus, the use of 3d-transition metals in organic transformation has been paid more attention in modern science with respect to traditional precious metal-based catalysts [1]. The development of base metal-assisted homogeneous catalysts applied for the (de)hydrogenation and sustainable catalysis with the controlled release of dihydrogen [2]. The use of 3d metals in sustainable catalysis is more predominant compare to their heavier homolog 4d/5d metal complexes due to the less cost, lower toxicity, and more abundant on earth's crust [3]. At this stage we should also mention that the one-electron transfer assisted redox-active reaction is an effective alternative pathway for the 3d metal-based catalysis system. To prevent the single electron transfer reaction some extra efforts are required in the ligand system for the successful design of the dehydrogenation catalysis. The synthetic application of dehydrogenative oxidation or coupling methodologies like acceptorless alcohol dehydrogenation (AAD) which differs from classical oxidation is highly demanding since hydrogen is the only by-product. Apart from the AAD, the tandem reaction like acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling (ADC) reaction or borrowing hydrogenation (BH) opens up a new avenue for the organic synthesis where dihydrogen and/or water is the only by-product which affords more environmentally friendly and sustainable process [2d]. Here we are highlighting the current application of the homogeneous 3d transition-metal catalyzed for the hydrogen formation from methanol, formic acid, and bio-alcohols via the dehydrogenation reaction pathways and the selected organic transformation where methanol, formic acid, or bio-alcohols are used as substrates (Scheme 1 )."
1,Hydrogen production and organic transformations from methanol,"Hydrogen fuel is a carbon-zero fuel and considered as one of the most effective alternatives to non-renewable fuels. Apart from the available techniques present, various sustainable techniques are developing day by day to produce hydrogen from readily available materials such as water or biomass. The storage and transportation of gaseous hydrogen are considered as the major challenges of the hydrogen economy although some techniques are developed for the storage of the gaseous hydrogen, like chemical storage, metal hydrides, MOF, liquid organic hydrogen carriers (cycloalkanes, N-heterocycles, formic acid, ammonia, and hydrazine, etc.) [2b]. Among them, liquid organic hydrogen carriers or the hydrogen generation from the hydrogen-rich organic substrates are considered as the more appropriate solution to this problem. Methanol, formic acid, and other polyols which are derived from biomass are potential substrates for the hydrogen production via the acceptorless dehydrogenation reaction."
2,Dehydrogenation of methanol,"2.1 Dehydrogenation of methanol Methanol is considered as the future fuel in terms of energetically effectiveness and ground transportation capability due to its efficient energy storage capacity by volume, user-friendly, abundant, and low leaking ability than hydrogen and also it is a sustainable raw material for synthetic hydrocarbons. Apart from the use of methanol as fuel it is also a good source for hydrogen production due to its high gravimetric hydrogen content of 12.6% and also represents a valuable feedstock for a chemical energy carrier [4]. Although the relevant issues on the methanol economy are high energy cost for generating the hydrogen, less energy density than ethanol and gasoline. Various noble metal and also base-metal-assisted homogeneous systems show effective catalysis for the hydrogen production from the aqueous methanol via dehydrogenation pathways and many reviews on this topic are already cited in the literature [5]. Here we are summarizing the current literature for the hydrogen production from the methanol where the 3d base metal homogeneous systems are used. In 2013, the first base metal catalyzed dehydrogenation of the methanol for the hydrogen production was reported by Beller and co-workers. (Scheme 2 ) [6]. Iron complexes 1 and 2 with the PNP pincer-type ligand (macho) supports are used for the catalytic dehydrogenation of methanol in a basic aqueous solution and yielded a TOF of 414 h−1 and 702 h−1 respectively. A maximum TON of 9834 in 46 h was achieved with the catalyst 2 (1 μmol). It is postulated that due to the “non-innocent” nature of the ligand, the outer-sphere mechanism of the alcohol dehydrogenation is the favorable pathway via the metal-ligand cooperativity. In presence of base, an amine deprotonation generates an amido intermediate which act as the catalytically active species. Bernskoetter, Holthausen and Hazari has reported the same reaction catalyzed by the iron pincer complexes (3 and 4) under a base-free condition (Scheme 3 ) [7]. It was observed that the presence of 10 mol% LiBF4 as a Lewis acid co-catalyst plays a significant role in the dehydrogenation of aqueous methanol with catalyst 3 and yield of the reaction remarkably increased with the maximum TON up to 51,000 with 0.006 mol% catalyst loading in 94 h. The mechanistic studies support the metal-ligand cooperativity and the role of Lewis acid as co-catalyst in the methanol dehydrogenation steps. At the initial step, dehydrogenation of methanol takes place and formaldehyde is formed which undergoes water addition to generate methanediol and further dehydrogenation of methanediol generates a Fe-formate intermediate. The LA facilitates the decarboxylation of the Fe-formate species by generating CO2 and H2 and completing the catalytic cycle. In 2017, the Beller group reported the first example of Mn-pincer catalyst for the selective dehydrogenation of aqueous methanol under the basic condition to H2 and CO2 (or carbonate) (Scheme 4 ) [8]. More than 20,000 TON value was achieved over one month of time by the catalyst 5 which indicates the long-term stability of the catalyst compared to its Fe analog (1). The active amido species is the key intermediate for the dehydrogenation of methanol afforded gaseous hydrogen and dehydrogenated C1 products."
3,Organic transformations using methanol,"2.2 Organic transformations using methanol In recent years, methanol also has been used as an attractive alternative methylating agent in the synthesis of fine chemicals [9]. The research group of Morrill has reported an earth-abundant (cyclopentadienone)iron carbonyl complex (6) as an excellent borrowing hydrogenation catalyst for methylation of ketone, indoles, oxindoles, amines, and sulfonamides functionality using methanol as methylating agent [9a]. The detailed mechanistic studies have disclosed that the additive Me3NO activate the precatalyst (6) via decoordination of CO, which reacts with methanol in presence of base to form formaldehyde and an iron hydride species. The generated formaldehyde undergoes aldol condensation with substrate (ketone) followed by dehydration to form an enone, which reacts with the iron-hydrogen species affording the C-methylated product with regeneration of the active iron complex (Scheme 5 ). Later on, the same research group has reported the one-pot conversion of allylic alcohol to α-methyl ketone derivatives using the catalyst 6 under similar reaction condition at more elevated temperature [10] (Scheme 6 a) whereas the research group of Renaud has reported a three-component tandem reaction of alkylation to form α-methylated ketone derivatives using complex 7 where methanol is used as the methylating source (Scheme 6b) [11]. The Morrill group has also reported the β-C(sp3)-Methylation of alcohols via borrowing hydrogen techniques using iron catalyst 7 (Scheme 6c) [12]. The Mn catalyst 8 was also reported by Sortais group [9b] for the α-methylation of ketone derivative using methanol as methylating agent whereas Liu group [9c] reported the double α-methylation of ketones using the Co(BF4)2 and L1 ligand as catalyst and methanol as the methylating source (Scheme 6d)."
4,N-methylation and N-formamide formation reactions using methanol,"2.3 N-methylation and N-formamide formation reactions using methanol In 2020, the Morrill's group has reported the commercially available nitroarenes into N-methylarylamines with good yields using a well-defined PN3P–Mn complex (8) with methanol as a hydrogenating agent as well as the methylating agent (Scheme 7 ) [13]. Mechanistic studies indicate that the base treatment of complex 8 formed an active dearomatized [Mn]-complex which afforded aniline and formaldehyde upon transfer hydrogenation of nitrobenzene and methanol. A condensation of aniline and formaldehyde afforded N-methyleneaniline followed by hydrogenation with the Mn-hydride provided the N- methylated product and the catalytically active species was regenerated by completing the catalytic cycle. In 2016, the Beller's group reported selective N-methylation of substituted primary aryl amines catalyzed by the Mn pincer complex 5 in presence of a base and methanol (methylating agent) under mild reaction conditions (Scheme 8 ) [14]. In 2017, the research group of Sortais has reported the selective mono-N-methylation of aniline derivatives using 5 mol% of Mn-pincer complex 8 in presence of catalytic amount of base (20 mol% t BuOK) with excellent yields, (Scheme 9 ) [15]. In the same year, the Beller's group also reported the same reaction with Mn-catalyst 9 (2 mol%) in presence of base, and methanol as solvent at 100 °C using the borrowing hydrogen methodology (Scheme 10 ) [16]. In 2017, Liu's research group reported a cobalt-catalyzed [Co(acac)2 in combination with ligand L1 (PP′3) and base (K3PO4)] methylation of benzyl amines and aniline derivatives using methanol (Scheme 11 ) [17]. Several control experiments and deuterium-labeling experiments indicate that a PP′3 ligand coordinated Co species was formed which in the presence of base and methanol afforded a cobalt-methoxy complex. β-hydride abstraction generates a Co-hydride intermediate by releasing formaldehyde which reacts with the amine to produces a methanolamine coordinated Co-hydride intermediate. The hydride transfer leads to the formation of the Co-methylamine coordinated complex which releases the methylamine as final product and Co-methoxide complex is regenerated. In 2017, the research group of Milstein has reported an Mn-pincer complex (10) catalyzed N-formylation of amines with methanol via liberation of hydrogen (Scheme 12 ) [18]. The reaction was performed in absence of any additives, bases, or hydrogen acceptors, under mild conditions where various primary and secondary amines are selectively formed N-formylated products with good to moderate yields. Mechanistic studies and the DFT calculation indicate that the metal-ligand cooperation plays a significant role for the methanol coordination to the active amido species and the coordinated alkoxy intermediate undergoes a β-hydride elimination to form a hydride complex via rare hemilabile arm opening of the amine by forming a nine membered metallacycle. The generated Mn–H intermediate eliminates the molecular H2 by forming the amido species and completing the cycle. In 2017 the research group of Bernskoetter reported Fe-hydride complex 4a catalyzed N-formylation of secondary amines via the dehydrogenative coupling with methanol and maximum TON up to 600 was achieved using 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline as substrate (Scheme 13 ) [19]."
5,Hydrogen production & organic transformations from formic acid (FA),
6,Dehydrogenation of formic acid,"3.1 Dehydrogenation of formic acid Another most important chemical resource for hydrogen production is formic acid (FA), which is an abundant and biodegradable liquid. Formic acid dehydrogenation makes a promising contribution to the safe and reversible storage, transport, and use of hydrogen. Dehydrogenation of formic acid (FA) has attracted much attention due to its reversible hydrogen storage potential with a 4.4% hydrogen content although it has a wild application as a transfer hydrogenating reagent for the organic transformation [2b,c,20]. Several studies already have addressed the noble metal catalyzed dehydrogenation of FA for the hydrogen formation with high selectivity of H2/CO2 formation [21]. Herein we are disclosing the use of the 3d transition metal catalyst system for dehydrogenation of formic acid for the H2 formation as well as the hydrogen source for the several organic transformations. The first hydrogen production from formic acid with an iron-based catalyst system was reported by Beller in 2010, under light-driven conditions (Scheme 14 ) [22]. A TOF of 200 h−1 and TON of 126 resulted from the action of HCO2H/NEt3 (5:2) in DMF as a solvent with in situ generated complexes [Fe3(CO)12/PPh3/L2] [L2: 6,6′′-(phenyl)-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine] and [Fe3(CO)12/PPh3/L3] [L3: 1,10-phenanthroline] at 60 °C. The visible light is necessary for synthesizing the Fe-hydride active intermediate which drives the catalytic cycle whereas the presence of PPh3 also plays a crucial role to stabilize the intermediates. The research group of Beller reported a promising protocol for dehydrogenation of FA using iron-based catalytic system at ambient temperature without any base and additive-free conditions (Scheme 15 ) [23]. A maximum TOF of 9425 h−1 and 92,417 TON was reported at 80 °C with a 0.005 mol% [Fe(BF4)2·6H2O/L1]. In the dehydrogenation of formic acid, Fe-hydride species [Fe(H)(L1)]+ is a key intermediate which is formed by the treatment of Fe(BF4)2·6H2O and ligand L1 with formic acid. In 2013, Milstein and co-workers have reported decomposition of formic acid to CO2 and H2 using an iron-based pincer complex (11) with TON up to 100,000 (after 10 days) at 40 °C in the presence of trialkyl amines (Scheme 16 ) [24]. The long-term stability of the complex 11 is the key factor for such exceptional catalytic activity. A mechanism of dehydrogenation of FA was described where the complex 11 first protonated to form a cationic intermediate 11b which eliminates H2 to generate intermediate 11c. Due to the unavailable vacant site on the metal center, a non-traditional β-hydride elimination mechanism was proposed, where the oxygen bound iron formate complex 11c undergoes an intramolecular isomerization to generate a hydrido-formate complex 11d which regenerates the iron-dihydride complex 11 with the elimination of CO2. In 2014, Schneider and Hazari disclosed Fe(iPrPNHP) complex 3a as catalyst for the FA dehydrogenation in presence of LiBF4 (10 mol%; a Lewis acid as co-catalyst) in dioxane enable to reach a TON of 983642 and TOF 196728 h−1 (Scheme 17 a) [25]. The presence of Li+ acts as a Lewis acid with the weakly coordinating anion facilitated the decarboxylation process of iron formate intermediate which increases the catalytic activity. In the same year, Enthaler and Junge reported (tBuPCP)Ni-hydride catalyst (12a) system for the dehydrogenation of FA in the mixture of octyldimethylamine in propylene carbonate as solvent at 80 °C and the highest TON of 626 was achieved via the catalytic cycle of Ni-hydride 12a and Ni-formate 12b intermediates. (Scheme 17b) [26]. The Ravasio's group has also explored a copper-based catalyst [Cu(OAc)2] and HCOOH/amine system for the production of H2 from FA (Scheme 17c). In this system the catalytic activity is tuned by using different amines; however, the best conversion is achieved in presence of highly basic dibutyl amine and triethylamine [27]. The research group of Gonsalvi, has reported dehydrogenation of formic acid (TON = 6061) using an iron catalyst [Fe(BF4)2·6H2O/L4] under the base and additive-free conditions (Scheme 18 ) [28]. The detailed mechanistic studies highlighted that a metal-hydride intermediate plays a significant role in the dehydrogenation reaction. Again in 2016, the research groups of Gonsalvi and Kirchner reported the dehydrogenation of FA using PN3P–Fe pincer complex (13) under mild reaction conditions. They reported a detailed investigation of the effect of additives, bases, catalyst loading, temperatures. A TOF of 2635 h−1 and TON = 10,000 was observed using 0.01 mol% catalyst in presence of the equivalent amount of triethylamine (Et3N) at 80 °C (Scheme 19 ) [29]. Details mechanism studies have depicted that the formate ligand switches from η1-O to η1-H coordination to Fe is taken place to generate a dihydride intermediate. In 2018, Hazari and Bernskoetter reported an iron precatalyst (14) with isonitrile and borohydride ligands with a substituent on the nitrogen of the macho ligand. This complex is used for the dehydrogenation of FA and it is showed that the catalytic activity can be tuned without the metal-ligand cooperating (MLC) ligand system although the TON value showed poor catalytic activity (Scheme 20 ) [30]. In 2019, the research group of Beller reported the first cobalt-based pincer complex (15) for the dehydrogenation of FA with a TON up to 7166 after 70 h in an aqueous medium under mild reaction conditions. With the support of KIE experimental and DFT calculation, it is proposed that the N–H group is stabilizing the transition state (15b) through hydrogen bonding of N–H…OOCH in the outer coordination sphere supports the hydride (15c) formation. The C–H activation step of the formate intermediate which leads to CO2 release was observed as the rate-determining step of the reaction although the catalyst may be deactivated due to the coordination of in-situ generated little amount of CO to metal center (Scheme 21 ) [31]. In 2019, Tondreau and coworkers reported dehydrogenation of FA using Mn(I) complex [(tBuPNNOP)Mn(CO)2]Br (16) with the maximum TOF of 8500 h−1 in presence of Et3N under mild reaction condition and maximum TON of 20000 was achieved under the constant pressure protocol [32]. A detailed mechanistic study of this catalyst was done by the Marino group in 2021 [33]. They revealed that the catalysis proceeds via Mn–H intermediate (16c) which was formed after CO2 release, followed by the evolution of the H2 with the amine assisted pathway (Scheme 22 ). In 2020, the research group of Beller reported a stable phosphine-free effective Mn-catalyst for the formic acid dehydrogenation with maximum TON of 5763 and yielded >14 L (H2:CO2 mixture) after 45 h. During the catalysis process, the accumulation of FA causes an increase in pH, which is responsible for the decline of catalytic activity. However, the catalytic activity can be preserved by maintaining a particular pH (below 6.5) by using a buffer solution or by adding HCOOH periodically/continuously (Scheme 23 ) [34]. Later, the same research group has reported an improved hydrogen productivity (>10 L after 12 h and TON>7500) by using new Mn(I) κ2-NN catalyst (18) for the selective dehydrogenation of FA with a very minimal amount of CO formation (<50 ppm) (Scheme 24 ) [35]. Hazari and Bernskoetter reported an excellent iron complex (19) containing (iPrPNMeP) ligand moiety for the FA dehydrogenation reaction. The system has shown an excellent catalytic activity (TON of 100,000 which is comparable to some precious metal systems and 62,000 h−1 TOF) with catalyst loading of 0.0001 mol% under mild and additive free conditions in the toluene and t BuOH solvent mixture. The detailed mechanistic studies and the DFT calculation predict that the improved stability of the catalyst with the iPrPNMeP ligand is the key factor for excellent catalytic activity. (Scheme 25 ) [36]. In 2021, the Cantat research group reported a catalyst system of PP(NH)PCoX2 (X = Cl, OAc) (20a, 20b) for the dehydrogenation of formic acid where the theoretical studies have shown that the intermolecular H-bonding with the ligand system (PNH), plays a significant role for the formic acid activation [37]. The catalytic activity of Co–H complex (20c) was separately synthesized and a maximum TOF of 67 min−1 and TON of 458 was reported without any bases and additives under mild reaction conditions (Scheme 26 )."
7,Organic transformations using FA,"3.2 Organic transformations using FA In 2011, the research group of Beller reported the combination of Fe(BF4)2·6H2O and tetraphos ligand L1 [L1 = P(CH2CH2PPh2)3] for the conversion of substituted nitroarenes to corresponding anilines employing formic acid as a dihydrogen source. The best result, up to 95% yield was obtained with 0.02 mmol of catalyst loading whereas the isolated complex[FeF(L1)]+ (A) also showed a similar catalytic activity under the same reaction condition. A Fe–H complex in presence of CsF is also equally active for the same reaction which suggests that a Fe–H/F complex intermediate involves in the formic acid dehydrogenation process and followed by the nitro compound undergoes three subsequent catalytic cycles to afford the amine as the final product (Scheme 27 ) [38]. In 2017, Beller group reported a methodology for the transfer hydrogenation of substituted quinolines and N-heteroarenes using formic acid as hydrogen source (Scheme 28 ) [39]. A catalytic system of [Co(BF4)2·6H2O] with various phosphine ligands were reported where tris(2-(diphenylphosphino)phenyl) phosphine ligand (L5) showed the excellent reactivity however this catalytic combination is only active with formic acid under base-free condition and other formate sources remain inactive."
8,Hydrogen production & organic transformations from bio-alcohol,"Bioalcohols (eg. bioethanol, glycerol), which can be simply defined as alcohols derived from biomass (agricultural residues or paper industry residues) have made a potential contribution to biofuel for their renewable characteristics and minimal undesired effect on atmospheres. Biomass is processed mainly through thermochemical and biochemical/biological methods to generate biofuels. Ethanol can be directly produced from biomass via fermentation and ethylene glycol or glycerol are the by-products of the bio-refinery [40]. The growing demand for renewable fuels has forced the search for agriculturally derived products and to create more energy efficiency options. Here we are discussing the selected examples of dehydrogenation reactions of bio-alcohols catalyzed by 3d base-metal complexes for the production of hydrogen gas, or use as bio-fuels as the renewable energy system."
9,Dehydrogenation of bio-alcohol,"4.1 Dehydrogenation of bio-alcohol In 2015, Crabtree and Hazari group reported a maximum TON of 770 and 880 respectively with the iron complexes 2 and 3a (0.02 mol%) for the selective conversion of glycerol to lactic acid in the water/NMP (N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone) solvent mixture with NaOH as base at 140 °C after 6 h [41]. The catalytically active Fe-amido species activate the glycerol and formed glyceraldehyde as the dehydrogenated product by the elimination of H2. The formed glyceraldehyde is afforded to lactic acid in presence of basic water through a series of base catalyzed reactions (Scheme 29 ). The glycerol also served as the hydrogen source in transfer hydrogenation reaction of acetophenone to 1-phenylethanol with a good yield in presence of catalyst 2 and base. (Scheme 30 ). In 2017 Dumeignil and Gauvin reported iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) based PNP-pincer complexes (21 and 1) for the oxidative transformations of 1-butanol into the corresponding carboxylic acids with the generation of hydrogen as only the by-product (Scheme 31 ) [42]. The manganese catalyst proved to be more efficient than their iron counterparts, under similar reaction conditions however the dehydrogenation reaction afforded more yield in absence of water which is mechanistically different from the Ru-catalyzed reaction. Several bio-sourced alcohols are also converted to corresponding acid with good to moderate yields under optimized reaction conditions catalyzed by 21 and 1."
10,Organic transformations from bio-alcohol,"4.2 Organic transformations from bio-alcohol The bioalcohols like methanol ethanol are suffering from low energy density and the high miscibility with water suppresses down the utilization of them as biofuel. An alternative approach to synthesize relatively higher energy density alcohol like n-butanol via Guerbet [43] type condensation reaction was reported. To date, noble metal based (Ru [44], Ir [45]) complexes constitute significant catalytic activity for the upgrading of ethanol into 1-butanol. Among these, the acridine-based ruthenium complex reported by the Milstein's group served as a promising activity with a TON of 18209 [46]. Recently some 3d metal catalysts is also reported with good effectiveness for this transformation which are covered here. In 2017 Liu and co-workers reported a PNP-[Mn] catalyst (5) for an efficient reaction of ethanol to 1-butanol via Guerbet type condensation. The synthesis of 1-butanol was reported with maximum TON up to 114120 using 0.0001 mol% catalyst loading under optimized reaction conditions in 168 h with high selectivity. The detailed mechanistic studies and the control experiment depicted that the N–H moieties of pincer manganese catalyst play a significant role via metal-ligand cooperation for the dehydrogenation of ethanol and the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde during catalytic cycle (Scheme 32 ) [47]. In 2019, the same research group also implemented the same Mn-catalyst for upgrading ethanol with methanol into iso-butanol. The reaction of ethanol and methanol (4 ml ethanol and 41.6 ml methanol) with 0.031 mol% Mn-catalyst (5), 280 mol% NaOMe afford a maximum TON of 9233 and TOF up to 833 h−1 under optimized reaction condition (Scheme 33 ) [48]. Recently, the research group of Wass disclosed the Mn catalyst (22) with phosphine-based chelating ligands for the transformation of ethanol and methanol to iso-butanol. A maximum TON of 206 and selectivity up to 74% was reported with the bis(diphenylphosphino)methane (dppm) ligand and it is observed that during the catalysis, formate was formed which further underwent Cannizzaro-type reaction with methanol to form isopropanol (Scheme 34 ) [49]. The dehydrogenative coupling reaction with the alcohol and amine opens a new read-map for the organic synthesis where various types of diol derivatives are used to synthesize many value added products. In 2016, Milstein's group reported cobalt pincer complex (23) catalyzed direct synthesis of 1,2,5-substituted pyrroles afforded from dehydrogenative coupling of 1,4-diols and amines with the liberation of water and hydrogen gas as the sole by-products although NaBEt3H as additive and t BuOK as base are required for the reaction (Scheme 35 a) [50]. In 2017, the same group also reported a synthesis route to afford benzimidazoles from aromatic diamines and alcohols via the dehydrogenative coupling process using the same Co complex (23) under similar reaction conditions (Scheme 35b) [51]. The cyclic imides can also be synthesized using acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling methodology from diols and amines catalyzed by an earth-abundant manganese pincer complex (24) where hydrogen gas is only the sole by-product (Scheme 35c) [52]. In 2015 the research group of Beller also reported the synthesis of various lactones through a dehydrogenative pathway catalyzed by the iron pincer complex (2) in which molecular hydrogen is only the by-product (Scheme 36 ) [53]."
11,Hydrogen production from the LOHC and dehydrogenation of N-heterocycles,"As we discussed earlier, hydrogen fuel faces difficulties in storage, transport, and safety issues. Several efforts are made for the development of a hydrogen storage system (solid or liquid chemicals) that can be capable of fast refueling at ambient temperatures and pressure. However, liquids storage material has practical advantages over solids by means of distribution, delivery, and risk and several liquids organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) material was developed. Although each system has its own limitation like alkene-arenes pairs for the hydrogen storage suffers from endothermic nature during H2-release [54]. Alan Cooper and Guido Pez [55,56] used an organic heterocycle H2-storage strategy for first time followed by other nitrogen containing organic ring were used which makes H2-release thermodynamically feasible with H2-content in the range of 5.3–7.3 wt%. The harsh reaction condition limited the catalyst lifetime although several systems are reported for the efficient hydrogen production from the LOHC system [57,58]. Here we are discussing the selected example of the sustainable homogeneous 3d transition-metal catalyst for the dehydrogenation of LOHC system. In 2014, Jone's research group reported an iron-based catalyst (2) for the reversible hydrogenation/dehydrogenation of N-heterocycles [59]. Catalytic cycle of dehydrogenation involves a penta-coordinated iron hydride amido intermediate, whereas during dehydrogenation trans-Fe(H)2 species is to be active intermediate. They have also demonstrated that N-atom in heterocycle plays a crucial role during catalysis and it undergoes a sequential amine dehydrogenation and isomerization rather than direct alkane dehydrogenation. In 2015, the same group reported a cobalt pincer catalyst (25) for the acceptorless, reversible hydrogenation/dehydrogenation of N-heterocycle compound. Mechanistic investigation suggests that dehydrogenation occurs through a cooperative manner in which N–H moiety is participative during catalysis but during hydrogenation, the catalyst containing both N–H and N–Me remain active [60]. In 2020, Rueping's research group presented PhPNP-Mn (26) catalyst for the acceptorless dehydrogenation/hydrogenation of N-heterocycles. The air and moisture stable Mn catalyst system tolerates several functional groups and leads to high yield under mild conditions (Scheme 37 ) [61]. In 2020 the research group of Banerjee reported a Ni-catalytic system for dehydrogenation of N-heterocycles with 99% yield although molecular oxygen is used as an oxidant (Scheme 38 ) [62]. Dehydrogenation involves a stepwise process with enamine-imine tautomerization followed by CC double bond isomerization. The catalytic system was tolerated in the presence of alkoxy, alkyl, chloro, primary amine, free hydroxyl, internal and terminal olefin, ester and trifluoromethyl groups. This protocol is also helpful in the synthesis of ligands and drugs although this system is not used as a LOHC system."
12,Conclusion,"In this review, we have summarized the recent significant improvements in the reactivity of homogeneous 3d base-metal catalysts for the dehydrogenation and useful organic transformations using methanol, formic acid (FA), and bio-alcohols. Particularly, homogeneous first-row transition metal-based dehydrogenation finds significant improvements in the ‘hydrogen economy’ and dehydrogenation of formic acid as a green LOHC. Furthermore, we have described the considerable progress of easy and safe storage of hydrogen in liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) particularly in N-heterocycles."
