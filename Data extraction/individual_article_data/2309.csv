0,Introduction,"Food spoilage is mainly caused by the presence and growth of food microorganisms. It has been demonstrated that the shelf life of products can be extended by very good packaging. Nowadays, consumers have paid more attention not only to the safety of packaging, but also to the biodegradability of packaging materials. Therefore, there are many efforts on replacing traditional plastic materials with biodegradable material. In this field, one kind of biodegradable films, prepared by the edible polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids etc, is much more attractive. However, there is no one degradable film that is perfect since each film has its own advantages and disadvantages. Normally, several active components are mixed together to form a film. After tested, the drawbacks of the film will be overcome, and the overall performance will be therefore optimized. Recently, there are lots of significant progress on the investigation of composite materials for film preparation (Zhou, Xu, Zhang, & Zhang, 2019). Curdlan, an extracellular polysaccharide, is mainly fermented by bacteria of the Rhizobium family which is considered as non-pathogenic and non-toxic microorganisms. Curdlan is soluble in alkaline solution but not in water or alcohol. Importantly, a gel can be formed using curdlan in water dispersion system under heating conditions. It has been proved that the thermogel of curdlan formed at 80 ℃ is still stable even at a lower temperature. Curdlan has been attracting increased attention due to its safe and biodegradable characteristics of preparing blending film. And nowadays, curdlan is widely used in many kinds of foods (Zhai & Iwata, 2019), such as tofu, noodles, jellies and low-fat meat products. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a non-toxic, hydrophilic, and highly polar synthetic biodegradable polymer. PVA is an environmentally friendly material which can be easily degradable to carbon dioxide and water. Pure PVA film has good elongation at break and gas permeability. Meanwhile, it also has good chemical stability. It has now been implanted in human body as a biofilm (Dominguez-Martinez et al., 2016). However, due to its hydrophilicity nature, even if it is applied to the surface of food, it can be easily removed by water wash. Besides, PVA has excellent application in food preservation, whereas, it fails to preserve the foods with high water content. Therefore, researchers have blended PVA with other substances to improve the properties of films that can be used for food preservation. Marvdashti (Monjazeb Marvdashti, Koocheki, & Yavarmanesh, 2017) used PVA to improve the physicochemical properties of Alyssum homolocarpum seed gum (AHSG) films resulted in significantly increasing the moisture content, solubility, elongation at break (EB) and transparency. Feng et al. (Feng, Liu, Makino, García Martín, & Cummins, 2017) studied the effect of modified chitosan/PVA antibacterial packaging on sausage storage. There was no significant difference observed in the hardness and elasticity of sausages on days 1 and 29. It was also found that as storage time increases, the microbial growth is significantly inhibited. Zhen et al. (Yu, Li, Chu, & Zhang, 2018) developed silica in situ enhanced chitosan/PVA biodegradable films which the permeability of oxygen and moisture reduced by 25.6 % and 10.2 %, respectively, extending the preservation time of cherries up to 3 times. To improve the functional properties, it is proposed to mix degradable films with other functional compounds (Acosta, Jiménez, Cháfer, González-Martínez, & Chiralt, 2015). Essential oils are naturally derived from plants and have been recognized as safe substances by the US Food and Drug Administration (Calo, Crandall, O’Bryan, & Ricke, 2015). It is quite often to employ essential oils as an active packaging substance to improve shelf life and food quality. Thyme essential oil is a natural, safe and non-toxic plant secondary metabolite (Lin, Zhu, & Cui, 2018). Studies have shown that thyme essential oil has excellent antibacterial effects on a wide range of bacteria{Perdones, 2016 #116;Yu, 2018 #106}, including Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7, Salmonella, etc.(Cui, Ma, Li, & Lin, 2016), mainly because thyme essential oil contains phenolic substances, especially thymol and carvacrol (Altan, Aytac, & Uyar, 2018). Hu, Zhang, Xiao, & Wang (2018) added the cinnamon-thyme-ginger compound essential oil to the chitosan film, and the composite film showed long-acting antibacterial activity against E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus, and also their thermal stability was significantly improved. However, when exposed to air conditions, the volatility, hydrophobicity and special flavor of thyme essential oils limit its use in food preservation. A study has shown that the escape of volatile matter can be controlled by encapsulating it in an aqueous dispersion (Valencia-Sullca et al., 2016). Tehrany (Jiménez, Sánchez-González, Desobry, Chiralt, & Tehrany, 2014) incorporates lecithin liposomes containing eugenol or cinnamon leaf essential oil into the chitosan film to increase the retention of volatile compounds. Chilled meat is fresh meat that is immediately cooled to 0–4 °C after the slaughter of live animals, and maintained at 4 °C in the process of production, transportation and sales (Moreira, Oliveira, Silva, & Saraiva, 2019). Oxidative deterioration of cold meat can cause discoloration, shortened shelf life, and nutrient loss. Besides, oxidation also produces an unpleasant odor due to the production of aldehydes, ketones, alcohols and other toxic compounds (Falowo, Fayemi, & Muchenje, 2014). Furthermore, the decomposition of protein molecules in meat and the volatile alkaline nitrogen formed by microbial reproduction can produce an unpleasant odor, bitterness and reduce meat quality (Cai et al., 2014). At present, meat clings film on the market is mainly low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polydichloroethylene (PVDC) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). These films are easy to use and have a good freshness retention effect. However, the materials such as PVC are difficult to degrade after use, which causes serious damage to our environment. Therefore, people are constantly looking for a degradable film containing an active substance as an alternative to chilled meat preservation. In these regard, thyme essential oils have been proven that it has excellent antibacterial and antioxidant properties. So far, some articles have been published concerning on this particular essential oil and its application on food preservation (Jamroz, Juszczak, & Kucharek, 2018). Therefore, the present study was conducted to address the literature gap and to study the detailed applications on the essential oil blending film with improved qualities by increasing its mechanical properties and water vapor barrier properties. Further, this study also explored the essential oil blending film for chilled meat preservation and to determine the effect of thyme essential oil on the film."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Curdlan((C6H10O5)n, 70−80 kDa) was purchased from Taixing Dongsheng Biotechnology Co., Ltd Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) ((C2H4O)n, polymerization degree, 1797; alcoholysis degree, 96.0–98.0 %) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd Thyme essential oil was purchased from Nanjing Qingqing Reagent Co., Ltd Glycerine, tween 80, and lactic acid were purchased from Nanjing Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd."
3,Film preparation,"2.2 Film preparation 2.2.1 CD/PVA blending films The PVA dissolved in water was weighed and stirred at 90 °C for 30 min to prepare PVA solution (5 wt%); similarly, curdlan was dissolved in water, which contributes to the preparation of curdlan water suspension (5 wt%). Further, curdlan water suspension with the PVA solution was gently mixed according to the mass ratio of the two is 5:0, 4:1, 3:2, 2:3, 1:4, 0:5. Glycerin (20 % of dry matter) and Tween 80 (20 % of dry matter) were added, with the mixed solutions adjusted to pH 4.0 using lactic acid. Then the final mixture was stirred evenly and homogenized at 8000 rpm for 30 s. Fifty milliliters of film-forming liquid was immediately poured into a polytetrafluoroethylene plate (18 cm × 18 cm) by solution extension method and allowed to heat at 100 ℃ for 2 min, and cool at room temperature. After drying at 25 ℃ and RH50 % for 24 h, the film was peeled off. 2.2.2 CD/PVA/thyme essential oil blending films Firstly, The PVA/curdlan mixed solution at the ratio of 4:1 was prepared. Then, the thyme essential oil of the base material at different concentrations of 1.0 %, 1.5 %, and 2.0 % were added to the mixed solutions. Again, the glycerin (20 % of base material content) and Tween 80 (20 % of base material content) were added to the mixed solutions, and the pH was adjusted to 4.0 using lactic acid. The final mixture was stirred evenly, and homogenize at 8000 rpm for 30 s. Fifty milliliters of film-forming liquid was immediately poured into a polytetrafluoroethylene plate (18 cm × 18 cm) by solution extension method and allowed to heat at 100 ℃ for 2 min, and cool at room temperature. After drying at 25 ℃ and RH 50 % for 24 h, the film was peeled off."
4,Film properties,"2.3 Film properties 2.3.1 Mechanical properties The sample film was cut into a rectangle having a width of 80 mm × 20 mm, and the sample to be tested was placed at RH 50 %, and equilibrated for 12 h at 25 ℃, and then the sample was taken out for measurement. The tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (EB) were determined using a texture analyzer equipped with a tension grip (A/TG) according to the method of Zhao and Park (2004). The film specimens were mounted on the self-tightening roller grips of the testing machine and stretched at a rate of 0.8 mm s−1 until breaking. Each group was repeated six times. The tensile strength is calculated by Eq. (1), and the elongation at break is calculated by Eq. (2): (1) TS = F / (d × W) Where ‘TS’ is the tensile strength (MPa), ‘F’ is the maximum tensile force (N) of the film at the break, ‘d’ is the thickness of the film (mm), and ‘W’ is the width of the film (mm). (2) EB=[(Dmax-D0) / D0]×100 % Where ‘EB’ is the elongation at break (%), Dmax is the maximum length (mm) at which the film is stretched at the break, and D0 is the original length (mm) of the film. 2.3.2 Moisture content The film was dried at 100 ℃ until constant weight, further, the initial and dried sample weight was recorded. Each set of blending films was subjected to three replicate measurements. The moisture content (%) was calculated using Eq. (3): (3) MC=(m1-m0) / m0 Where m1 and m0 are initial and dried sample weight, respectively. 2.3.3 Water vapor permeability The water vapor permeability (WVP) was measured using the method of Liming Zhang, Wang, Dong, Sun, & Zhao (2019) with some modifications and employed the simulation cup method. Anhydrous calcium chloride powder (20 g) was added into the test cup, with a distance between the calcium chloride powder and cup rim of less than 5 mm. The cups were placed in a chamber at 25 ℃ and 75 % RH and the internal and external sides of the film were kept in at a confirmed water vapor pressure difference. The cups were removed and weighed every 12 h. The measurement was repeated three times for each group. WVP was calculated as follows using Eq. (4): (4) WVP=(mL) / (AtΔP) where ‘m’ is the mass of moisture that permeated through the film (g), A is the permeation area (m2), L is the film thickness (mm), t is the permeation time (s), and ΔP is the pressure difference between the two sides of the film (Pa). 2.3.4 Microstructure of the film Microstructure analysis of the cross-section of the film was carried out using a cryo-scanning electron microscope (Cryo-SEM) (XL-30ESEM, PHILIPS). The natural cross-section of the film to be tested was frozen by liquid nitrogen at a low temperature, and the cross-section of the film to be tested was observed under a cryo-scanning electron microscope to determine the change in the microstructure of the film. 2.3.5 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) The film sample was placed in an oven and dried at 40 ℃ to a constant weight, and the sample film was measured using a Fourier infrared spectrometer (Nicolet Is10,Thermo Fisher) (Chetouani, Elkolli, Bounekhel, & Benachour, 2017). The dried sample film was placed on the surface of the attenuated total reflection probe, and the scanning was carried out 32 times, and the scanning wavelength range was 550−4000 cm−1 to obtain an infrared spectrum. 2.3.6 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) The thermal properties of CD/PVA films were determined by Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)(DSC-2000PC, NETZSCH). The 3∼5 mg films were cut into small pieces and placed in a sample tray of DSC equipment. The samples were scanned at a heating rate of 10 ℃/min in a temperature range of 25–600 ℃. A DSC curve was obtained. 2.3.7 X-ray diffraction The film to be tested was dried to constant weight and placed in a diffraction scanning chamber for measurement. A diffraction curve was obtained over a range of angles from 5° to 55°. The difference in crystallinity was analyzed from the graph."
5,Application to chilled meat preservation,"2.4 Application to chilled meat preservation 2.4.1 Packing chilled meat with the blending film Chilled meat (black pork tenderloin) was divided into equal portions (65 g each) and packed using the blending film. Five sample groups were packed with different blending films and stored in the refrigerator at 4 °C for 20 days. Control:Pure curdlan film; L.0: CD/PVA = 4/1; L.1: 1.0 % thyme essential oil composite film; L.2: 1.5 % thyme essential oil composite film. L.3: 2.0 % thyme essential oil composite film 2.4.2 Antibacterial activity analysis Total plate count (TPC) and Escherichia coli were counted for each treatment group according to the standard methods in Chinese Standards GB4789.2-2016 and GB 4789.3-2016. The pork samples (10 g) were blended with distilled water (90 mL), and then serially diluted. One milliliter diluted sample was spread on the colony counting plate to determine total plate counts (TPC). The plates were incubated at 37 ± 1 ℃ for 24 h. Escherichia coli was incubated on plates containing eosin methylene blue medium for 48 h, and the bacterial colonies on the plate were counted under the same conditions and expressed as log10 colony forming units (cfu/g). 2.4.3 Determination of TVB-N According to the Chinese standard GB5009.228-2016 (Zhou et al., 2019), the volatile base nitrogen of chilled meat was determined, and the semi-micro nitrogen method was used for determination. 2.4.4 Evaluation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) Lipid peroxidation was measured using a TBARS assay according to the method described by Zheng et al. (2018). First, a standard curve of malondialdehyde (MDA) was constructed using titration end point (TEP) solutions of different concentrations. The standard curve was constructed using the MDA content in the test tube as the abscissa and the absorbance value measured at 532 nm as the ordinate. The TBARS value of chilled meat was measured as follows. Samples (5 g) were accurately added to 15 mL of A solution (weigh 75.0 g of trichloroacetic acid, 1.0 g of disodium EDTA and 1.0 g of propyl gallate dissolved in ddH2O, makeup to 1 L). A 5-mL aliquot of the filtrate was transferred to a plugged test tube, followed by solution B (5 mL), mixed evenly, and reacted for 40 min in a water bath at 100 ℃. The absorbance was measured at 532 nm. The MDA content was calculated according to the MDA standard curve, while the TBARS value was expressed as mg MDA/kg. 2.4.5 Color According to the method described by Liu, Wu, & Tan (2010), the color of the chilled meat were measured by a color difference meter. The color difference meter was corrected with a white plate, and the surface color of the cold meat was measured using a viewing angle of 2°. All readings were performed in triplicate. 2.4.6 pH The pH was determined according to Chinese Standard GB 5009.237-2016. The samples (10 g) were homogenized in distilled water (90 mL). The pH values were then measured on each sampling day using a digital pH meter (Orion 3-Star Plus, Thermo Scientific, USA). All readings were performed in triplicate."
6,Statistics analysis,"2.5 Statistics analysis Data were analyzed by single-factor analysis of variance and Duncan’s multiple comparison test (P < 0.05) using SAS software (the SAS system for windows 9.0, English), and the results are presented as means ± standard deviation of triplicate measurements."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Films properties,"3.1 Films properties 3.1.1 Mechanical properties The change in tensile strength and elongation at break of curdlan/polyvinyl alcohol blend film is shown in Fig. 1 . It is found that the tensile strength of curdlan/polyvinyl alcohol blend film decreases as the proportion of polyvinyl alcohol increases. The pure curdlan film has the lowest tensile strength, and the addition of polyvinyl alcohol improves the tensile strength of the blended film. When the ratio of curdlan to polyvinyl alcohol is 4:1, the elongation at break of the composite film is the highest, although it is not as good as the pure polyvinyl alcohol film, but it is twice as high as that of the pure curdlan film. As the amount of polyvinyl alcohol added increases, the elongation at break of the blend film is reduced. It is known that a brittle matrix having a low elongation can be produced due to the intermolecular interaction and the presence of hydrogen bonds between polymer chains. According to the results (Ansorena, Marcovich, & Pereda, 2017), plasticizers were added to reduce the friction between polymer chains, thereby improving their mechanical properties. The −OH in the polyvinyl alcohol and the −OH in the curdlan produce intermolecular hydrogen bonds, so that the film forms a uniform network structure and can improve mechanical properties. However, when the blending ratio of PVA is increased, the compatibility of the film is deteriorated, and it is difficult to form a complete colloidal structure, so that the elongation at break of the blended film is lowered. Therefore, in the subsequent study, the film was formed at a blending ratio of 4/1. The tensile strength of ordinary food packaging bags is usually 5–15 Mpa, and the elongation at break is about 200 %. As shown in Fig. 1a, the tensile strength of the CD/PVA blending film decreases slightly with the addition of thyme essential oil. Meanwhile, the amount of thyme essential oil added at 2.0 % on the dry matter of the film liquid, the tensile strength of the film was reduced to 10.4 MPa. Fig. 1b shows that the elongation at break of the CD/PVA blend film increases with the addition of thyme essential oil. It was observed that 2.0 % of essential oil addition reached the elongation at break of the film to 225.99 %, which was significantly higher than that of the elongation at break of the blend film without thyme essential oil. This study showed that the elongation at break of the blend film was obviously improved, due to thyme essential oil addition. The essential oil can act as a plasticizer to enhance the elongation at break of the blending film, and increases the compatibility between the polyvinyl alcohol and the curdlan. In the presence of thyme essential oil, the weaker polymer-oil interaction in the film network replaces the polymer-polymer interaction, which resulted in the decrease of in the density of the film matrix. Also,it helps to improve the structure of the composite film with more dense, which facilitates the movement of the polymer chain and improves the flexibility of the film, thereby increasing the breaking elongation of the film. It was reported that the elongation in the film of alginate and applesauce was improved with the increase of oregano, cinnamon and lemongrass essential oils (Rojas-Graü et al., 2007). We also found this similar results in our study. 3.1.2 WVP and moisture content The thickness of the film is an important factor affecting transparency, permeability and mechanical properties. The thickness of the film decreases as the blend ratio of curdlan decreases. As shown in Table 1 , the pure curdlan film has a higher moisture content due to the water retention of curdlan. The moisture content (MC) of the blend film decreases as the blend ratio of polyvinyl alcohol increases. The WVP of the blend film decreases with the addition of polyvinyl alcohol. Therefore, the addition amount of polyvinyl alcohol is increased, and the barrier property of the composite film is also enhanced. When CD/PVA = 4/1, WVP is only 1.64 × 10−10 g/m2/Pa/s The reason may be that polyvinyl alcohol has a high barrier property, and it can be blended with a polysaccharide, and the structure of the film is made tighter due to the intermolecular force. Wu et al. (2017) prepared a composite film by blending starch with PVA, and its WVP was in the range of 0.1∼1 × 10−9g m−1 Pa−1s−1. The WVP rate of CD/PVA blend film was lower than that of the PVA blend film which has been studied. Table 1 shows that the blending film containing higher water content, and the absence of essential oil. The results revealed that the water content of the blend film decreases with the addition of thyme essential oil, and the WVP was also the same. Shojaee-Aliabadi et al. (2013) also found similar results by adding thyme essential oil to carrageen film. Hosseini, Razavi, & Mousavi (2009) pointed out that the hydrophobicity of essential oils which may affect the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the film. The reason may be that the thyme essential oil has a hydrophobic group, and the essential oil component interacts with the hydroxyl groups of the blending film to reduce the hydroxyl and water molecules. The interaction happens due to the presence of lipid globules enhances the tortuosity factor of the vapor diffusion path through the film, resulting in a decrease in the WVP and water content of the blending film. Similar results were obtained in the present study using chitosan, sodium alginate and different types of essential oils. The presence of thyme essential oil and curdlan increases the compatibility of polyvinyl alcohol and curdlan due to the presence of intermolecular forces (Hu et al., 2018). The structure of the blending film becomes more uniform as the amount of essential oil increases. The reason may be due to the dense of the film structure, thus, the gas permeation path was blocked, which increases the barrier property of the film. 3.1.3 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) The thermal stability of the film reflects the degree of tolerance of the film to temperature changes and provides a strong basis for practical use in production. When the sample is heated to the melting stage, its components require additional energy to vibrate and separate the bonds from the crystal arrangement. Fig. 2 a shows the results of differential thermal scanning of a pure curdlan film and a CD/PVA = 4/1 blending film. The graph shows the enthalpy change of the composition of the composite film during the heating process. After adding polyvinyl alcohol, the DSC curve thermal conversion peak shifts slightly to the right. The heat absorption peak of the pure CD film corresponds to a temperature of up to 309 ℃. When PVA is added, the heat absorption peak conversion temperature of the film is up to 342 ℃. Compared with the pure curdlan film, the thermal stability of the blending film is enhanced. The CD/PVA blending film has a melting range of 342–343 ℃, indicating strong intermolecular interactions between the molecules. These intermolecular interactions can be mainly attributed to the good thermal stability of the curdlan. The crystallinity of polyvinyl alcohol is relatively high, and the two are compounded and blended to produce intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which makes the blending film structure more compact, thus enhancing the thermal stability of the polyvinyl alcohol and the curdlan blending film. It has been determined that the hydrogen bond interaction of the biofilms which are mixed with konjac glucomannan (KGM) and curdlan is much larger than that of other single matrix films (Wu et al., 2012). Therefore, the stability of the blending film can be greatly improved. In practical applications, the heat treatment of food makes the thermal stability of the composite film practical, which greatly limits the stability of the outer packaging. Ghanbarzadeh & Oromiehi (2009) reported that the melting point temperature is directly reflected by the phase transition temperature in the DSC spectrum. Fig. 2b shows the differential thermal scanning results of different thyme essential oil composite films. During the whole heating process, the structure of each component phase has changed, which corresponds to different enthalpy changes. Although increase of thyme essential oil addition, the DSC curve heat absorption peak gradually shifts to the left and the phase transition temperature decreases, which means that the thermal stability of the composite film with thyme oil added decreases with the increase of essential oil addition. Jouki, Mortazavi, Yazdi, & Koocheki (2014) found the same phenomenon by adding thyme essential oil to the seed gel film. The cause of this phenomenon can be explained by the molecular structure of thyme essential oil, which reduces its influence on the total chain mobility in the CD/PVA film. The plasticizing effect was caused by thyme essential oil because of its absorption of water molecules. Both the thermal phase transition temperature and the thermal stability of the composite film will be reduced after thyme essential oil added. This trend is consistent with that obtained by Ghasemlou, Khodaiyan, Oromiehie, & Yarmand (2011). 3.1.4 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) Fig. 3 a shows the results of infrared scanning spectroscopy of a pure matrix film and a CD/PVA = 4/1 blending film. Theoretically, a hydroxyl group having no hydrogen bonding has an absorption peak around 3600 cm−1 (Monjazeb Marvdashti et al., 2017). If intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds are formed, the absorption peak moves to a lower frequency due to stretching vibration. When PVA is added to the mixture, the stretching vibration absorption band moves to a lower frequency, as shown in the figure, representing the absorption peak of intramolecular or intermolecular hydrogen bonds at a wave number of 3317 cm−1, which is absorbed after the addition of polyvinyl alcohol. The peak slightly shifts to the right and the hydrogen bond appears to increase. This phenomenon is called the ""red shift"" effect, mainly because the PVA backbone is linked to a large number of hydroxyl groups (−OH), which produces intermolecular hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups in the available polysaccharides. The −OH bond is elongated and reduced. The energy required to stretch the −OH bond. At 2919 cm−1, the absorption peak representing C–H increases with the addition of polyvinyl alcohol, at 1651 cm−1 due to the presence of CO and CO stretching vibrations from acetate groups in PVA. The absorption peak shows an increasing trend. The symmetry deformation of −CH2 and −CH3 causes peaks at 1418 cm−1 and 1367 cm−1 to change. In addition, the COC group is stretched at a peak of 1030 cm−1, and the film spectrum also shows peaks of about 924 cm−1 and 848 cm−1, which are attributed to the vibration (Pereira, de Arruda, & Stefani, 2015) of the main chain CC in PVA and the presence of β-glycosidic bond in curdlan. Compared with the pure curdlan film, the intermolecular force between the curdlan and the polyvinyl alcohol is changed, and the properties of the blending film are also changed. It can be seen from Fig. 3b that the absorption peak at the wavenumber of 3288 cm−1 represents an intramolecular or intermolecular hydrogen bond, and the absorption peak at this point increases with the addition of thyme essential oil and shifts to the right, possibly in the polysaccharide and PVA. The hydroxyl group produces an intermolecular hydrogen bond with the phenolic hydroxyl group in the thyme essential oil. The C–H stretching absorption wave number of olefin is 3100∼3010 cm−1, and the main characteristic absorption of alcohol and phenol is the stretching vibration absorption peak of OH and CO. The absorption peak at 2913 cm−1 represents C–H stretching vibration; the wave number 2873 cm−1 is mainly −CH3 symmetric stretching vibration. The absorption peak of CO at 1680 cm−1 showed an enhanced tendency, indicating that the intermolecular force between the substances changed after the addition of thyme essential oil (Li, Ye, Liu, & Zhao, 2015). −CH2 scissor vibration at 1418 cm−1, and the absorption peak was enhanced. The COC group is stretched at a peak of 1030 cm−1. At peaks at wavenumbers of 924 cm−1 and 848 cm−1, these peaks are attributed to the vibration of the PVA backbone CC (Pereira et al., 2015) and the presence of β-glycosidic bonds. With the increase of the content of thyme essential oil added, it can be found that the β-glycosidic bond inside the curdlan is weakened, which provides a good basis for the subsequent better combination with curdlan. 3.1.5 X-ray diffraction The degree of crystallinity is closely related to the properties and structure of the composite film and is an important parameter for characterizing the composite film material. Crystallinity has attracted tremendous attention because it is closely related to the stability of the material. Fig. 4 show an XRD analysis of blending films. Crystallization is closely related to the arrangement of molecules in the films. As the crystallinity increases, the melting point of the molecule increases. Fig. 4a shows XRD analysis of pure matrix films and CD/PVA = 4/1 blending films. Crystallization is a molecular arrangement in which the crystallinity is proportional to the melting point of the molecule; the crystalline region is a regularly arranged region, and the amorphous region is a randomly arranged region. A substance with high crystallinity exhibits a narrow and high peak shape; a low crystallinity substance exhibits a peak width and a low peak shape (Salama, Abdel Aziz, & Sabaa, 2018). As can be seen in Fig. 4a, the absorption peak of the pure curdlan film at 2θ = 15° is a wide and low shape, and the crystallinity is low. However, in the similar absorption peak region 2θ = 22°, the absorption peak of the CD/PVA blending film is narrow and high, the crystallinity increases with the addition of polyvinyl alcohol, and the stability of the blending film increases. It can be seen from the XRD pattern of the blending film in Fig. 4b that the film without thyme essential oil addition has a sharp and high absorption peak at 2θ = 20° and 2θ = 37°, and the corresponding crystallinity is higher. However, when the similar absorption peak regions are 2θ = 22° and 2θ = 37°, the absorption peak width was low and the crystallinity decreases as the content of the thyme essential oil increases, and the thermal stability of the blending film also slightly decreases. 3.1.6 Cryo-scanning electron microscopy Cryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) provides a better understanding of the relationship between WVP, mechanical and film structure characteristics. Fig. 5 shows the cryo-SEM pictures of the different sample films. The SEM images represent the surface of the cross-sections of the investigated films. As can be seen from Fig. 5a, the pure curdlan film has a flat surface and exhibits a uniform structure, in which the polysaccharide chains aggregate to form a continuous and dense network. In the Fig. 5b, it is indicated that after added polyvinyl alcohol, the granular structure at the cross section of the composite film is reduced. And importantly, there is no obvious phase separation, crack or pore on the surface, which is a fibrous block network structure, but the network structure is relatively dispersed. When the Cryo-SEM test film is destroyed by liquid nitrogen, the CD/PVA blending film has a rough cross section due to its brittle structure, while the pure CD film has a relatively smooth cross section, mainly due to its good film formation properties and flexibility. The results are consistent with Limpan (Li et al., 2015). The two materials have good compatibility. PVA is incorporated into the CD film to form a uniform fiber structure, and interaction forces such as hydrogen bonding are generated between the two to maintain the stability of the network structure and make the film denser, thereby improving the mechanical properties and WVP of the film. In Fig. 5b, it was observed that the CD/PVA = 4/1 blending film has a fibrous cross-section; whereas, in Fig. 5c–e, as the content of thyme essential oil increases, the blending film has a tighter microstructure and a smooth surface. The film containing thyme essential oil has a relatively smooth surface, and without no micropores. A rough counter resulting in a loose texture was observed in thyme essential oil-free films (Fig. 5a and b). With the additional thyme essential oil, the compatibility between the components of the blending film was increased to improve the microstructure of the composite film. This optimized structure is the reason why the WVP of the films with higher oil content is lower (Perdones, Chiralt, & Vargas, 2016). Comparing Fig. 5e with Fig. 5b, it can be found that the blending film with 2% thyme essential oil is smoother and finer than the film without thyme essential oil, and has no fibrous structure. Tween 80 as a surfactant can emulsify thyme essential oil. Incorporating emulsified thyme essential oil into CD/PVA blending films (Fig. 5c–e) increased the degree of compactness and developed finer film networks of higher density. This trend is consistent with that obtained by Hashemi Gahruie, Ziaee, Eskandari, & Hosseini (2017). As with the results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, it seems that thyme essential oil acts as a plasticizer to increase the compatibility between the polyvinyl alcohol and the curdlan and hence enhanced the elongation at break of the blending film."
9,Application the blending film to chilled meat preservation,"3.2 Application the blending film to chilled meat preservation 3.2.1 Antibacterial activity analysis As seen from the Table 2 that under the refrigerated condition at 4 ℃, the total bacterial count in the sample of each treatment group was increased with the increase of storage time. Whereas compared with the control group, the microbial growth of the four treatment groups L.0, L.1, L.2, and L.3 was significantly inhibited. At the beginning of storage, the total number of colonies and Escherichia coli in the control group increased rapidly, while the microbial growth was inhibited by the group treated with the composite film. The storage period reached up to six days. The total bacterial count of the control group which became corrupt meat exceeded 6.0 and the Escherichia coli exceeded 4.0. With the increase of thyme essential oil, the L.0 group has been closed to metamorphism on the 8th day, the total bacterial count has exceeded the limit of 106 CFU/g on the 10th day, and L.1 has deteriorated on the 10th day. The shelf life of L.2 and L.3 were extended up to fourteen days. The blending film with thyme essential oil had more antibacterial effect, which was mainly due to the activity in thyme essential oil. The composition has a strong surface activity and is continuously released when exposed to meat (Moradi, Tajik, Razavi Rohani, & Mahmoudian, 2016). It can penetrate the phospholipid bilayer of the microbial cell film, resulting the death of the microorganisms caused by the imbalance of water (Gómez-Estaca, López de Lacey, López-Caballero, Gómez-Guillén, & Montero, 2010). 3.2.2 Determination of TVB-N TVB-N is commonly used to determine the freshness of meat products. Owing to the presence of bacteria, the proteins in meat are decomposed into amines and ammonia. These substances are volatile and they are the one of the important factors which affecting the smell of meat. As shown in Fig. 6 a, the TVB-N values of the five groups of chilled fresh meat were different after refrigeration treatments. The results revealed that the freshness of the meat was significantly increased even after storing it for a long period. However, when compared to the control and L.0 group, the other three groups did not show any significant result. When the storage time was eight days, the TVB-N values of the control, L.0 and L.1 group had increased significantly. At 4 °C storage, the control treatment group had exceeded the limit of 15 mg/100 g at 10 days, and the L.0 and L.1 treatment groups exceeded the limits to 14 days and 16 days, respectively. It is worth noting that the TVB-N values of the L.2 and L.3 treatment groups did not exceed the limit during the storage period of 16 days. 3.2.3 Evaluation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) TBARS is an important indicator of the degree of fat oxidation in meat and meat products. Fig. 6b shows the effect of different treatments on TBARS of chilled meat. The TBARS value of the control group without the film wrapping process increased rapidly since day 2. Although the TBARS of the film wrapping samples were also increased, it is slower than the control group, especially the L.3 group. As the added amount of thyme essential oil increased, it was observed that the TBARS activity of the chilled meat packaged with blending film was lower. This study confirmed that thyme essential oil could be released into packaged meat products. Due to its excellent antioxidant properties, the oxidation process of cold meat can be delayed. Therefore, the period of TBARS is no longer than 16 days. During the initial storage period, there were significant differences of the TBARS value between the untreated group and the other treated groups. Besides, on 12 days, the TBARS value of the cold meat treated with the composite film became smaller, and the TBARS value without the film treatment was not similar. It was found that each treatment group did not exceed the limit of 1.0 mg MDA/kg for 16 days. 3.2.4 Color Fig. 7 shows that the whiteness L* value of the cold meat increased during the whole storage process. The L value of the control group was slightly higher than that of the other film-coated treatment groups at the beginning of storage. This may be because the blending film was packed on the surface of fresh meat, and the sample was insulated from contact with air to reduce the oxidation process. When the storage period reaches 10 days, the L* value of the control group rises faster, and the L* value of other treatment groups increases with slight change. As the content of thyme essential oil increased, the L* value of the blending film-wrapped treatment group also changed, but the difference was not significant. The L* value of the L.3 group during the storage period was minimum. This may be attributed to the antibacterial and anti-oxidant effects of thyme essential oil, which enhances the preservation effect of the composite film. As the storage period increases, the thyme essential oil gradually diffuses into the wrapped meat, delaying the change of its lightness. The a* value refers to the redness, which is mainly affected by the color of myoglobin in the meat and meat products and the degree of oxidation. During the storage of cold meat, the oxygenated myoglobin in the meat was oxidized to high iron myoglobin and the color of the meat changes from red to brown. The a* value is also an important indicator for determining the degree of oxidation of meat and meat products when performing colorimetric analysis. It can be concluded from Fig. 7b that after various treatments, the a* value of the chilled meat exhibits a downward trend throughout the storage period. At the initial stage of storage, the value of the sample was changed greatly, but the medium-term trend became stable, and the value of a* was increased later in the control group. The a* value of the control group was not covered by the film changed greatly. At 14 days, the a* value of the Control group suddenly decreased, and the change range was significantly larger than that of the other treatment groups. The a* values of the three treatment groups such as L.1, L.2, and L.3 were wrapped with different amounts of thyme essential oil composite film, showing a decrease midway through the storage. The film has better color protection and oxidation resistance. In the first 6 days, the b* values of the Control group and the L.0 group were significantly different from those of the other three groups, indicating that the degree of oxidation of cold meat was increased at this time. After that, the b* value of each treatment group became smaller and became flattered. This may be due to the partial degradation of oxidation products generated during the initial storage period. At the end of the storage period, the b* values of each treatment group tend to be balanced. Compared with the control group and the L.0 treatment group, the total increase of b* values in the other groups was smaller. It was concluded that the slower oxidation of chilled meat was due to the stronger antioxidant capacity of thyme essential oil. Similar results were reported by Jridi et al. (2018). 3.2.5 pH pH is one of the indicators of whether meat and meat products are fresh (Cullere et al., 2018). It can be observed from Fig. 8 that the storage under 4 °C, the control group had a massive change in pH at the beginning of storage. Whereas, in other chilled meat packed with film the pH change was not significant. Since, the meat produces ammonia and amines through the oxidation process, therefore, the protein in the meat was decomposed by some proteolytic enzymes which were produced by microorganisms. It was noticed that the protein was decomposed to release a basic group, which causes the pH of the meat to rise. According to the Chinese standards, the meat is degraded when the pH value is above 6.4. At 12 days, the chilled meat without packing has deteriorated, and its pH exceeds 6.4, while the pH of packed meat was below 6.4."
10,Conclusion,"In this work, one novel blending film was prepared by curdlan/polyvinyl alcohol. Our results demonstrated that when the ratio of curdlan and polyvinyl alcohol composite film is 4:1, the mechanical properties of the composite film were the highest. After tested, the tensile strength was 11.81 MPa and the elongation at break reached 189.31 %, respectively. On the other hand, the WVP of the blending film was improved. Further, the functional properties of the curdlan/polyvinyl alcohol blending films were optimized by adding thyme essential oil. It was proved that in the presence of thyme essential oil, the elongation at the break of the blending films were significantly improved but not the WVP of the films. Importantly, the active antioxidant property of the blending film was improved using thyme essential oil. Finally, the shelf life of chilled meat was extended upon 10 days by using this new blending film. Our work provides a theoretical basis for the application of blending films in food preservation."
