0,Introduction,"Due to the rapid increase and sharp fluctuations in crude oil prices and increasing concern for environmental protection, new alternatives in the field of power supply are required to reduce the dependency on fossil energy resources and convert energy in a cleaner way. Hydrogen and/or hydrogen rich gas mixtures (syngas) receive much interest in high temperature fuel cell (HTFC) technologies [1–4] as well as in several chemical industries such as in the production of methanol, higher alcohols, detergents, ammonia and synthetic fuels (synthetic Diesel) [5]. Such gas mixtures can be produced from hydrocarbon fuels, such as oil and natural gas, by steam reforming, partial oxidation and autothermal oxidation, which is a combination of the prior mentioned processes [6]. The thermal partial oxidation (TPOX) process has several promising characteristics [7,8]. It is an exothermic process and has a good dynamic response time in comparisons with the other processes. It can also be applied to almost all gaseous as well as liquid hydrocarbons. Additionally, since catalyst does not involve in the process, catalyst deactivation problems are not pertinent. However, to achieve high syngas yields, the process has to be performed at low air fuel ratios. At such reaction conditions, the adiabatic flame temperatures decrease and hence the reaction kinetic is slowed down. Moreover, the tendency for soot formation increases. Therefore, thermodynamic and kinetic analysis should be performed to determine the practical operating conditions of the process. Diesel represents an attractive choice for on-board hydrogen production vehicles. It has a very high hydrogen density as well as high energy content. It has also a wide distributed infrastructure with standard storage systems. However, it was shown that reforming of high molecular weight hydrocarbons such as Diesel and n-heptane results in a reduced overall fuel conversion into hydrogen [9]. Besides, the complexity and variability of Diesel fuel make it difficult to study the thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors of the TPOX process. Consequently, several surrogates have been proposed to represent Diesel fuel such as n-heptane, n-hexadecane and Cetane. Ristori et al. [10], and Fournet et al. [11], used a detailed n-hexadecane (C16H34) model as diesel fuel surrogate. Dagaut [12] used a mixture of n-hexadecane, iso-octane, n-propylcyclohexane and n-propylbenzene, and 70/30 percent mixture of n-heptane and toluene. On the other hand, Ranzi et al. [13] proposed a lumped kinetic scheme for n-alkanes up to n-hexadecane. However, the models described in Refs. [10–12], were validated with the steady state jet- stirred reactor (JSR), while others were validated by the comparison with the experimental data of n-heptane [13]. Moreover, several researches were conducted to develop kinetic schemes for n-heptane oxidation [14–16]. However, some of these models have no detailed transport data [15,16]. In this work, the partial oxidation process of n-heptane (as diesel surrogate) has been numerically investigated. Equilibrium and kinetic analyses are performed with the CHEMKIN simulation package in order to investigate the influence of temperature, the air ratio λ and the residence time on the process. In the kinetic investigations, the process has been simulated in two different reactor configurations: freely propagating flames and well-mixed batch reactor. The comprehensive mechanism of Curran et al. [14] is applied for the kinetic calculations."
1,Equilibrium analysis of the partial oxidation process of n-heptane,"The analysis is used to identify the appropriate operating parameters and to investigate the product composition, which is expected to be important for design purposes. The thermodynamic analysis is performed using the EQUIL code of CHEMKIN 3.7 [17]. With EQUIL, thermodynamic equilibrium calculations are performed by minimizing the Gibbs free energy of a reacted mixture. For such analysis, the amount of individual elements in the initial state and the thermodynamic property data of each of the possible species likely to be present in the equilibrium state are provided. In the present study, the species included in the mechanism developed by Curran et al. [14] (561 species) are selected. The thermodynamic data required for the analysis include: the specific heat C p,k , the standard enthalpy H k o , and the standard entropy S k o . The corresponding mixture properties are then expressed as a function of these values and the mole fraction of the kth species y k . The Gibbs function is given by: (1) G = ∑ k = 1 n g ¯ k N k where g ¯ k is the partial molal Gibbs energy function, N k is the number of moles of each species k in the system, and n is the total number of species. For ideal-gas mixtures, the partial molal Gibbs function is given by: (2) g ¯ k = g k ( T , P ) + R T ln ( y k ) where g k is the Gibbs function for pure species k, evaluated at the system temperature T, and pressure P, and R is the universal gas constant. The equilibrium solution is subjected to the mass conservation of the individual element or the atomic population. (3) p j = ∑ k = 1 k n j k N k , j = 1 , … M where n jk is the number of jth atom in kth species, p j is the population or moles of the j atom in the system, M is the number of different elements present in the system."
2,Kinetic analysis,"The thermodynamic analysis does not involve chemical reactions and hence does not offer any insight to the kinetic behavior of the reaction mechanism or the feasibility of the TPOX process for real applications. Thus, kinetic analysis is also performed to obtain further understanding of the process behavior and to estimate the proper operating conditions for real applications. In the kinetic analysis, the reaction rates and the energy balance equation are considered. However, in some of the cases, where analysis is performed at constant temperature, the energy equation is not included. In such cases, only the mass balance equations for different species are considered. In the analysis, two different reactor configurations are considered: the free flame and the batch reactor. In the free flame reactor model, the laminar flame speed and syngas composition are estimated, while in the batch reactor model the progress of the TPOX process and the species profile of different species appear in the TPOX of n-heptane with time are investigated. These models are included in CHEMKIN tools; PREMIX for free flame model [18] and SENKIN for batch reactor model [19]."
3,Free flame model,"3.1 Free flame model The freely propagating flame configuration provides information about the propagation properties of rich flames, which occur in the partial oxidation process. The simulations are performed with PREMIX code; the chemical kinetics simulation code of CHEMKIN 3.7. In PREMIX, the kinetic model, the thermodynamic properties and transport effects are considered. This model is capable of predicting temperature and species profiles by solving the conservation equations for laminar premixed flame. The model equations for laminar, non-isothermal steady flow of chemically reacting mixture of ideal gases are given as follows: The mass flow rate is expressed as (4) M ˙ = ρ u A The energy equation (5) M ˙ ⅆ T ⅆ x − 1 c p ⅆ ⅆ x ( λ t A ⅆ T ⅆ x ) + A c p ∑ i = 1 K ρ Y k V k c p k + A c p ∑ i = 1 K ω ˙ k h k W k = 0 and the chemical species mole balance (6) M ˙ ⅆ Y k ⅆ x − ⅆ ⅆ x ( ρ A Y k V k ) − A ω ˙ k W k = 0 , k = 1 , … , K The density ρ in the above equations is determined using the ideal-gas law for a mixture of ideal gases: (7) ρ = P W ¯ R T where x is the spatial coordinate, T the gas temperature, M ˙ the mass flow rate, Y k and W k are the mass fraction and the molecular weight of species k in the mixture, respectively, and R the universal gas constant, P the pressure, c P the heat capacity of the mixture, h k the specific enthalpy of the kth species, ρ the mass density, W ¯ the mean molecular weight of the mixture, u the velocity of the gas mixture, λ t the thermal conductivity of the mixture, ω ˙ k the molar rate of reaction of the kth species per unit volume, V k the diffusion velocity of the kth species. The rate at which the specified species is formed or consumed, ω ˙ k is given by: (8) ω ˙ k = W k ∑ l = 1 N R ( ν k l ″ − ν k l ′ ) k j ( ∏ reactant c ν k l ′ − 1 K C ∏ products c ν k l ″ ) where N R is the number of reactions and ν k l ″ and ν k l ′ are the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants A k in a system of chemical reactions (9) ∑ k = 1 N S ν k l ′ A k ⇔ ∑ k = 1 N S ν k l ″ A k The reaction velocity coefficient k j (in Eq. (8)) is determined from the modified Arrhenius expression: (10) k j = k j o T β j exp ( − E a , j R T ) where k j o is the collision parameter, β j the temperature exponents and E a,j is the activation energies of reaction j. The input data are the reactants mass fractions and the pressure. In addition, the temperature profile and the intermediate species are provided as initial guess. With appropriate reaction mechanisms, kinetic data, and suitable thermodynamic and transport properties, the profiles of individual species, gas temperature, gas velocity, the laminar flame speed and the adiabatic flame temperature can be obtained in a number of grid points within the computational domain which covers the laminar flame length."
4,Batch reactor model,"3.2 Batch reactor model The batch reactor configuration corresponds to the perfect mixing between the reactants and the products. This case shows the limits of enhancing fuel conversion by improving mixing inside the reactor. The batch reactor simulations are performed with SENKIN, the chemical kinetics simulation code of CHEMKIN 3.6 [19]. The code predicts the time-dependent chemical kinetics behavior of a homogeneous gas mixture in a closed system. The simulations are performed at constant pressure and at a given temperature. Hence, the reaction rates are only considered without the energy equation being solved. In such case, only the mass balance equations for the different species are considered. (11) ⅆ Y k ⅆ t = v ω ˙ k W k where Y k is the species mass fraction of the kth species, v is the specific volume, W k is the molecular weight of the kth species and ω ˙ k is the net molar production rate of the kth species and given by Eq. (10). In isothermal well-mixed batch reactor, the input data are the reactants mass/mole fractions, the temperature and the pressure. With suitable reaction mechanisms and kinetic data, the profiles of different species can be obtained as a function of time."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Equilibrium analysis,"4.1 Equilibrium analysis In equilibrium analysis, the adiabatic flame temperature, the syngas composition and the reforming efficiency are computed for different n-heptane/air mixtures (different λ values) and different inlet temperatures. 4.1.1 Effect of temperature and air ratio The effect of the air preheating temperature on the adiabatic flame temperatures is shown in Fig. 1 (a). For a given mixture inlet temperature, higher adiabatic flame temperature is observed with higher λ values. At an air preheating temperature of 1000 K, the adiabatic flame temperature is 1300 K for λ = 0.32, while it is 1700 K and 1800 K for λ = 0.4 and 0.45, respectively. In order to achieve higher adiabatic flame temperature at low λ values, the air inlet temperature and thus the mixture inlet temperature must be increased. However, this may increase the risk of self-ignition. In Al-Hamamre and Trimis [20], the ignition behavior of Diesel/air mixtures was experimentally investigated. By making use of the ignition delay time behavior it was possible to stabilize the low temperature oxidation (cool flame) of Diesel/air mixture with λ = 0.4 and λ = 0.45 between 773 K to about 873 K without the risk of self-ignition. Moreover, the intermediate temperature oxidation region was stabilized for more than 5 h up between 873 K 973 K for the same λ values. However, all available mechanisms for n-heptane oxidation do not include the reaction roots that can describe the behavior in the intermediate temperature oxidation region [20]. Fig. 1(b) shows the reforming efficiency as function of the process temperatures and for different λ values. In the present work, the reforming efficiency is defined as the ratio between the heating values of the gas mixture, which is produced from the reforming process, to the heating value of the original fuel [8,21], (12) η = ( n H 2 × LHV H 2 + n CO × LHV CO ) n fuel × LHV fuel It can be observed that the maximum reforming efficiency (87.1%) is achieved at λ = 0.32 and for process temperature above 1300 K. Additionally, the reforming efficiency increases with increasing the process temperature and remains nearly constant for T process > 1100 K for most λ values. This trend can be explained by considering Fig. 2 (a–c) which shows the equilibrium mole number of CO, H2, CO2, H2O, CH4 and C2H2 as a function of T process for different λ values: 0.25, 0.32 and 0.4 respectively. The mole number is defined as the number of mole of the species produced in the process divided by the initial number of mole of the fuel. For lower temperatures, the complete combustion product (CO2 and H2O) appears in the product as it is shown in Fig. 2(a–c) and hence the calculated reforming efficiency is low. Moreover, with high process temperature, the possibility of hydrocarbons formation such as CH4 and C2H2 is reduced. As depicted in Fig. 2(a–c), the CH4 mole number approach zero when T process > 1100 K for λ = 0.32 and λ = 0.4 and at T process > 1600 K for λ = 0.25. This behavior shows the importance of the process temperature in increasing the reforming efficiency by enhancing the conversion of n-heptane to syngas. Another factor that affects significantly the reforming efficiency is the air ratio. The equilibrium analysis shows that for λ values above or below 0.32 the reforming efficiency decreases. At λ = 0.25, 0.4 and 0.45, the calculated values are 74, 77 and 71 percent respectively. This is because for λ < 0.32, the tendency for hydrocarbon formation such as C2H2 increases at the expense of carbon monoxide and hydrogen formation as presented in Fig. 2(a). On the other hand, with λ > 0.32, more oxygen is available in the process and hence the yield of complete oxidation products increase as shown in Fig. 2(c). However, the thermodynamic approach is adequate under near stoichiometric conditions but fails to predict the hydrocarbon formation and the significant decrease in efficiency for very rich mixtures [2,3]. 4.1.2 Effect of pressure The progress of reaction processes depends on the reaction temperature and pressure, the inlet gas composition and its temperature and the reactor volume. These factors affect the selectivity of the product depending on the type of reaction, i.e., exothermic or endothermic, the number of moles in the reactant and product sides. In this section, the effect of pressure in the TPOX process is investigated. Fig. 3 shows the hydrogen yield and the adiabatic flame temperature for λ = 0.4 at different pressures: 1, 10, 20, and 40 atm. It is clear from the figure that the pressure has a marginal effect on the adiabatic flame temperature and hydrogen yield only for T ad < 1500 K. By increasing the operating pressure from 1 atm to 40 atm at T in = 300 K, the adiabatic flame temperature is increased by 1.0 percent and the hydrogen yield is decreased by about 3.0 percent. This effect becomes negligible with increasing the adiabatic flame temperature. This means that the high temperature eliminates the pressure effect. The effect becomes obvious by referring to Fig. 4 (a) and (b), where the H2, H2O, CO and CO2 behaviors are presented at different reaction temperatures and pressures. It can be observed that the effect of pressure appears within the adiabatic temperature range 500 < T ad < 1500 K. Within this range, the H2 and CO mole numbers decrease, while those of CO2 and H2O increase. Outside this range the pressure effect is almost insignificant. This is because the partial oxidation reaction of n-heptane is affected significantly by the pressure increase due to the difference between the number of moles in the product and reactant sides (Le Chatelier's principle), Δn = n P − n R = 10.5. However, the effect of pressure on the complete oxidation reaction is much lower with Δn = 3. The respective partial and complete oxidation reactions are given as follows; (R1) C 7 H 16 + 3.5 ( O 2 + 3.77 N 2 ) → 7 CO + 8 H 2 + 13.2 N 2 , Δ H = − 585.48 kJ / mol (R2) C 7 H 16 + 11 O 2 → 7 CO 2 + 8 H 2 O , Δ H = − 4853.5 kJ / mole"
7,Kinetic analysis,"4.2 Kinetic analysis 4.2.1 Analysis using free flame model In the free flame model, the laminar flame speed and the adiabatic flame temperature in the lean and rich fuel side are estimated as a function of λ and at different pressures. Additionally, the syngas composition and the flame structure for λ = 0.4 and at preheating temperature of 700 K is investigated. 4.2.1.1 Laminar flame speed and adiabatic flame temperature Fig. 5 shows a comparison between the calculated and measured burning velocity of n-heptane. It can be observed that there is a difference not only between the simulated values, but also with the experimental ones. The values of Davis and Law [22] are lower than those presented by Gibbs and Calcote [23] in the fuel lean region, while they match in the rich region. The model, developed at Chalmers University [24] with 57 species and 290 chemical reactions, predicts lower burning velocities over the whole investigated range of λ (from λ = 0.3 to λ = 1.5), while those predicted using the model of Ref. [25] are higher in the fuel lean range but match the experimental values in the rich region. The lateral model consists of 44 species and 210 reaction steps; however, it does not include the low temperature oxidation range. The kinetic model of Curran et al. [14] is the most comprehensive model for n-heptane oxidation and it includes the cool flame reaction paths (low temperature oxidation reactions). The model includes 561 species and 2539 chemical reactions. As it is observed in Fig. 4, the model predicts reasonably well the laminar flame speed over the investigated λ range. For mixture inlet temperature of 298 K and at 1 atm pressure, the behavior can be well correlated with the following 6th degree polynomials S L = − 1384.6 λ 6 + 7414.3 λ 5 − 15517 λ 4 + 15962 λ 3 − 8382.8 λ 2 + 2165.4 λ − 215.28 Moreover, when the laminar flame speeds of rich fuel n-heptane/air mixtures are plotted on a logarithmic scale versus the inverse of the adiabatic flame temperatures, as depicted in Fig. 6 , the behavior follows an Arrhenius type expression, i.e. (13) S L = A L exp ( − E a 2 R T ad ) where A L is a pre-exponential factor of the laminar flame speed and equal to 446.6 cm/s, E a is the activation energy and R is the universal gas constant. The activation energy appears in the expression is equal to 98.438 kJ/mol and it corresponds to a global reaction involve in the partial oxidation process. This behavior is similar with that reported in Ref. [26] for the stoichiometric combustion of CH4, and also similar to that found in Ref. [27] for rich methane flame at pressure of 6 bar and an initial temperature of 673 K. In order to provide a better estimation of the feasibility of partial oxidation in a non-catalytic reactor, calculations of the adiabatic flame temperature and the laminar flame speed for different preheating temperatures are carried out. In Fig. 7 (a) the adiabatic flame temperature as a function of air ratio and for different preheating temperatures are presented. The results obtained from the simulations are presented for the fuel lean case and for the fuel rich case (TPOX conditions) as well. It can be noticed that T ad decreases by either decreasing or increasing the air ratio. For mixture inlet temperature of 298 K and at 1 atm pressure, the a 5th degree polynomials can be used to describe the relation between the air ratio and the adiabatic flame temperature T ad = − 1458.5 λ 5 + 8549.5 λ 4 − 17486 λ 3 + 13308 λ 2 − 1302.4 λ + 642.37 In Fig. 7(b) the laminar flame speeds of preheated n-heptane/air-mixtures are presented. At an air ratio of 0.4 and without preheating, the laminar flame speed with 5.0 cm/s is already 8.0 percent less than the stoichiometric value (40 cm/s). The main reason for the slow flame propagation is the decrease of the adiabatic flame temperature with the decrease in the air ratio. Thus, intensive preheating is necessary at low air ratio in order to increase the adiabatic flame temperature and achieve stable reaction, which is required for an efficient syngas production. High adiabatic flame temperatures also offer an additional effect of enhancing the conversion of C2H2, which is considered as soot precursor, and thus reduce the soot formation rate and at the same time accelerate the soot oxidation rate. The pressure effect on flame speed is considered in order to investigate the feasibility of performing high pressure TPOX. Fig. 8 shows the laminar flame speeds of n-heptane/air-mixtures as a function of the air ratio and for different pressure values. It can be observed that with increasing pressure, the laminar flame speed deceases. For example, at λ = 0.4 and at a pressure of 1.0 atm, the laminar flame speed is 5.0 cm/s, while at 20 atm pressure it is reduced to 3.0 cm/s. The effect becomes even more significant in the fuel lean side. Therefore, it can be concluded that the higher is the pressure the less is the flame stability. 4.2.1.2 Flame structure and syngas composition In order to obtain more details about the structure of the TPOX reaction, the mole fractions of the main species and the temperature profile are presented as a function of the distance in the flame and the residence time in Fig. 9 for an air ratio of λ = 0.4 and preheating temperature of 700 K. The residence times are found by converting length scales by (14) τ j = ∑ i = 1 i = j Δ x i V i where τ j is the residence time, Δx i mesh width and V i the calculated mean local gas velocity [27,28]. The local gas velocity, the gas density and the flame temperature are calculated at every grid point over the entire laminar flame length. Therefore, temperature and density effects are taken into account when V i is calculated. From the figure, it can be observed that the flame consists of: an initial narrow flame front in which fast oxidation reactions (R1) and (R2) take place and a long post oxidation regime characterized by slow endothermic reforming reactions. The main products of the first region are H2, H2O and CO. In the post flame zone, the water gas shift reaction (WGS) (R3) and reforming reactions with H2O take place (R4) and (R5). In the WGS zone, the temperature and the CO concentration decreases and that of H2 and CO2 increase. The CH4 and C2H2, which is supposed to be a soot precursor, are formed in the initial fast reaction zone then decrease slowly in the WGS and reforming zones as shown by (R4)–(R7). Thus, the concentration of CO increases once again in the reforming zone. The heat of reaction for the following reactions is calculated based on the standard heat of formation data available in Ref. [29]: (R3) CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + 2 H 2 Δ H = − 41.5 kJ / mol (R4) CH 4 + 2 H 2 O → CO 2 + 4 H 2 Δ H = + 165.05 kJ / mol (R5) CH 4 + H 2 O → CO + 3 H 2 Δ H = + 206.16 kJ / mol (R6) C 2 H 2 + 2 H 2 O → 2 CO + 3 H 2 Δ H = − 35.87 kJ / mol (R7) C 2 H 2 + 4 H 2 O → 2 CO 2 + 5 H 2 Δ H = − 46.43 kJ / mol As mentioned previously, kinetic schemes including appropriate thermal and transport data are required to solve the free flame model for given boundary conditions. However, the simulation is performed only to a relatively short residence time in this model (0.63 s in Fig. 6). The calculated reforming efficiency at the specified conditions at a residence time of 0.63 s is equal to 52.19%. With this time range, no information is available about the actual equilibrium time. This is due to the strong non-linearity of the model which makes it difficult to solve with the free flame model of CHEMKIN (PREMIX) for higher residence time, especially with such complex mechanisms [28]. Consequently, a simplification of the problem can be made by excluding the energy equation and the effect of transport properties by using an isothermal well-mixed batch reactor model. 4.2.2 Analysis using batch reactor model A representative example of species having major concentrations, which are produced using simulation in a batch reactor, is presented in Fig. 10 for λ = 0.4 and for a process temperature of 1650 K (which is equal to the adiabatic flame temperature at preheating temperature of 700 K). Similar to the simulation using the free flame model, it can be again observed that the TPOX process consists of three different regions: oxidation zone, WGS zone and reforming zone. In this figure, the time axis is presented using a logarithmic scale to bring out better clarity in the short time range. The different reactions that take place in the mentioned regions and the variation of the syngas composition with time are already discussed in section 4.2.1. For different λ values and temperature levels, the behavior of the chemistry remains the same, only the concentration levels and equilibrium time change. 4.2.2.1 Effect of temperature and air ratio The temperature represents an important factor in the partial oxidation process. It affects both the oxidation period and the overall process time. The oxidation period is located by drawing a tangent line at the point of inflection at the oxygen curve. The start of the period is estimated by the intercept of this tangent with the horizontal line which is drawn at the initial oxygen concentration. The end of the period represents the intercept of the tangent line with the zero oxygen concentration line as shown in Fig. 11 (a), which presents the specification of the oxidation period for λ = 0.4 at T process = 1300 K, while Fig. 11(b) shows the oxidation time as a function of the process temperature and at λ = 0.4. Since the oxidation period is very short, the time axis is presented in logarithmic scale for bringing out better clarity. It can be observed that the higher the reaction temperature the shorter is the oxidation time. For example, at λ = 0.4 and T process = 1300 K, the oxidation time (τ) is about 0.0029 s, while it is 2.0 × 10−5 at T process = 1900 K (Fig. 11 (b)). In Fig. 12 the time-dependent hydrogen concentrations for several temperatures are plotted for λ = 0.32 (Fig. 12(a)), λ = 0.4 (Fig. 12(b)) and λ = 0.45 (Fig. 12(c)). It can be seen that for a temperature of 1300 K more than 100 s are required to achieve equilibrium. This means that a large reactor volume is needed. The result suggests applying temperatures in the range of 1600–1800 K in order to achieve the equilibrium in acceptable reactor volume. For λ = 0.32, to achieve such high adiabatic temperatures, a preheating of the air over 1300 K is needed as shown in Fig. 1(a). At this temperature level the risk of self-ignition increase. 4.2.2.2 Effect of air ratio The syngas yield and hence the reforming efficiency is highly dependent on the composition of the original n-heptane/air mixtures, i.e. the air to fuel ratio or simply the air ratio. By increasing the air ratio, the temperature level within the TPOX process increases, without the need for intensive preheating, and hence the reaction kinetic is accelerated. This can be observed by comparing Fig. 12(a)–(c). For λ = 0.40, a temperature level of about 1650 K–1700 K can be reached when the fuel-air mixture is preheated to a temperature level in the range of 700–750 K. At a process temperature of 1650 K, 89% of the syngas equilibrium value can be achieved in 2.2 s. This corresponds to a reforming efficiency of 68.51%. This value can also be achieved in 0.99 s at a process temperature of 1700 K. At λ = 0.45 and mixture inlet temperature of 700 K (T process = 1800 K), for a residence time of 2.2 s the reforming efficiency can be as high as 70%. This value is close to the value computed by Vourliotakis et al. [3], using a reactor network approach with the kinetic scheme of Ref. [14] for n-heptane. In their work, a reactor network approach was used to predict the syngas yield and the reforming efficiency of the TPOX of heptane in porous media based reactor; act as a fuel processor for SOFC (Solid Oxide Fuel Cell). The TPOX reactor was previously described in Al-Hamamre et al. [7]. The reactor network used in their computations was the one used before in Vourliotakis et al. [1] in which the estimated overall residence time was 2.2 s. In Vourliotakis et al. [3], the computed efficiency at λ = 0.45 and for mixture inlet temperature of 700 K was approximately 67% and the maximum reforming efficiency was 70% obtained at λ = 0.47. Nevertheless, the value computed in this work for λ = 0.40 with mixture inlet temperature of 700 K at a residence time of 2.2 s is relatively higher than the calculated value in Ref. [3]. However, in the work described in Ref. [3] neither residence time nor thermal loads data were provided to allow real comparison. 4.2.2.3 Effect of pressure The kinetic analysis shows that the high pressure affects the path of the chemical reactions. At high pressure the oxidation zone is shorter than that at lower pressure. This is presented in Fig. 13 which shows the concentration profiles of the main species as a function of time, for λ = 0.4, T process = 1600 K and pressure equal to 1 atm and 40 atm. Increasing the pressure reduces the oxidation time, i.e. accelerate the oxidation reactions. For example, at 1 atm pressure, the oxidation time is about 6.0 × 10−04 s, while at 40 atm it is reduced to 5.0 × 10−05 s. However, since the progress of the complete oxidation products is faster at high pressure, it can be concluded that the complete oxidation reaction is the one which is accelerated by the increase in pressure. This is indicated by fast progress of the CO2 and H2O concentration and the slow progress of the H2 and CO concentrations in comparison with the concentration of these species at 1 atm. However, since the process temperature in Fig. 13 lies outside the temperature range 500 K < T process < 1500 K (the range in which the pressure affects the equilibrium composition of the TPOX process), the final equilibrium state in the figure is not affected. This is also an indication that the second region (shift-reforming reactions region) recovers the delay in the CO and H2 progress. 4.2.3 Comparison with the free flame model In order to investigate the validity of the free flame and batch reactor models, mole fractions of H2, CO and O2, for an air ratio of λ = 0.4 and the same adiabatic flame temperature (1650 K), as predicted by these two models are presented in Fig. 14 . From the figure it can be observed that by neglecting the diffusion effect, and hence due to perfect mixing, as it is the case with batch reactor configuration, the reactions are highly accelerated. However, this effect is limited only to the oxidation zone where the concentration gradients are high. The batch reactor predicts a faster oxidation zone (1.0 ms oxidation time) than the free flame model (3.0 ms). This shows that the reaction is mass transfer controlled in the oxidation region but not in the slow reforming region. With the batch reactor model, it is possible to perform simulations and to obtain solutions over long residence time, and hence prediction of the equilibrium time is possible. This is essential for sizing the TPOX reactor in order to achieve an acceptable syngas yield for effective operation of the energy generation unit (fuel cell or burner-boiler unit) as well as reducing unconverted hydrocarbon emissions. It is observed that the partial oxidation process, under fuel rich conditions is rather a slow process. The two slow regions, i.e., the WGS and the reforming regions, appear in the simulations obtained from the free flame model, where the transport effect is considered, and also in the batch reactor model, where the transport effect is neglected. Therefore, this process is likely to be kinetically controlled."
8,Conclusions,"In this work thermodynamics and kinetics investigations for the thermal partial oxidation of n-heptane are performed. The effect of several parameters including the mixture inlet temperature, the air ratio (λ), the pressure and the residence time are investigated. Thermodynamics analysis shows that the maximum reforming efficiency can be achieved at λ = 0.32 and T process ≥ 1300 K. At these conditions, the maximum syngas (H2 and CO) concentrations that can be achieved is y H2 = 28and y CO = 25 percent. However, the kinetic analysis shows that time needed to reach equilibrium at such conditions is more than 100 s. The results also suggest applying reaction temperatures in the range of 1600–1800 K in order to achieve the equilibrium in acceptable reaction time. For λ = 0.4 and 0.45, a temperature level of about 1700 K can be reached with an air preheating temperature of less than 1000 K. Moreover, the pressure has a marginal effect on the adiabatic flame temperature and hydrogen yield only in the temperature range 500 < Tad < 1500 K. Within this range, the H2 and CO mole numbers decrease, while those of CO2 and H2O increase. Nevertheless, this effect becomes negligible with the increase in adiabatic flame temperature, i.e., the high temperature eliminates the pressure effect. In the TPOX process of n-heptane, three different regions can be distinguished: fast oxidation region followed by two slow regions: the WGS and the reforming regions. These regions are identified using two different models: the free flame model and the batch reactor one. By comparing the two models, it is found that the transport properties of the reactive species affect the TPOX process in the oxidation region, while the process in the WGS and reforming reaction region is kinetically controlled."
