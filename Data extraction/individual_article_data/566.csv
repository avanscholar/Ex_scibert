0,Introduction,"High density and high thermal stability are critical for advanced jet fuels to guarantee high specific impulse and prevent deposits caused by thermal oxidation under long-time supersonic flight (Türker and Variş, 2014; Zhang et al., 2017) Besides, good low-temperature properties, e.g., low freezing point and low viscosity are also necessary to ensure proper function of fuel in high altitude and cold weather (Gollis et al., 1962). Decalins have been confirmed as one of the most thermally stable component of jet fuels due to the unique dicyclic structure with hydrogen-detonating capability (Heyne et al., 2009). In addition, they has higher density (about 0.88 g/mL) compared with conventional kerosene (about 0.78 g/mL) and acceptable low-temperature properties (freezing point of −43 °C, viscosity about 2.84 mm2/s at 20 °C) (Gollis et al., 1962; Silva et al., 2009). Actually, decalins are an important component of jet fuel JP-7 and JP-900 (Lovestead and Bruno, 2009; Roan and Boehman, 2004). However, decalins are currently produced by hydrogenation of naphthalene, a product from coal tar and sometimes petroleum distillation, which dramatically limits its accessibility. Recently, using biomass-derived chemicals as alternative resources to produce jet fuel has attracted intensive attention as response for depleting fissile resources and decreasing greenhouse gas emission (Cheng and Brewer, 2017; Nie et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016; Zou et al., 2012). Corma’s group reported the co-conversion of aromatics such as toluene, o-dimethylbenzene and mesitylene with 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to synthesize alkylcyclohexane as component of kerosene (Arias et al., 2015). It is worth noting that the aromatics can be obtained not only from refineries but also from lignin through depolymerization and hydrodeoxygenation (Huang et al., 2015; Jongerius et al., 2013), and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural can be produced from dehydration of hexoses, glucose and fructose (Dai et al., 2017; Hansen et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2013). Therefore, it presents a promising approach to produce jet fuels based on the efficient utilization of biomass and refinery derivatives. However, such synthesized hydrocarbons are not satisfied as advanced jet fuels because of the relatively low density. Thus many efforts have been made to synthesize polycyclic hydrocarbons with higher density by conversion of ketones (Sheng et al., 2015) (Deng et al., 2015a, 2016; Pozdeev et al., 2011; Sheng et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2014), 2-methylfuran (Zhang et al., 2018), olefins (Deng et al., 2015b), terpenes (Meylemans et al., 2013, 2011, 2012; Nie et al., 2014), phenols (Nie et al., 2017a, 2017b) and so on through various CC coupling reactions like aldol condensation, oligomerization, Diels-Alder addition and alkylation. Very recently, Zhang and Li’s group synthesized a mixture of polycycloalkanes containing about 77% decalin by a consecutive operation of dehydration of cyclopentanol to cyclopentene, oligomerization/rearrangement of cyclopentene, and then hydrogenation (Chen et al., 2016). This work offers a new route for synthesizing decalin from biomass-derived chemicals, although it requires a relatively complicated reactions and separations. Notably, branched alkanes can be synthesized in large scale from butene and isobutane by alkylation and hydrogen transfer catalyzed by liquid acid like H2SO4 in one-pot reaction (Corma and Martínez, 1993). Also Tsai synthesized methyldecalin and ethyldecalin using methylcyclohexane and cyclohexene in one-pot reaction (Tsai, 1990). Actually, cyclohexene can be produced in-situ from dehydration of cyclohexanol under the catalysis of acid, which suggests that branched decalins may be produced directly from alcohols and alkanes. Furthermore, it has been reported that branched decalins have lower freezing point than decalins meanwhile still keep good density and thermal stability (Gudzinowicz et al., 1963). With these considerations, in this work we reported a one-pot production of branched decalins (mainly methyldecalin and ethyldecalin) using cyclic alcohols (including cyclohexanol, cyclopentanol) with cyclic alkanes (including methylcyclohexane and methylcyclopentane) as feedstock. It is worth noting that the cyclic alcohols can be produced in industrial scale by the selective hydrogenation of phenols and furfural respectively (Fang et al., 2017; Li et al., 2015; Nakagawa et al., 2014; Yao et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2014) and have been widely used in synthesizing high-density biofuels (Chen et al., 2016; Zhao and Lercher, 2012), whereas methylcyclohexane and methylcyclopentane are bulk chemicals from refineries and can also be produced through hydrocracking of lignin (Chen et al., 2015; Kasakov et al., 2015; Zhao and Lercher, 2012). Notably the synthesized branched decalins have outstanding fuel properties like lower freezing point and comparable density and heating value compared with decalin. Therefore, this work is expected to provide a scalable way to produce branched decalins as excellent component of advanced jet fuels."
1,Experiment,"The co-conversion of cyclic alcohols (cyclohexanol, cyclopentanol) with cyclic alkanes (methylcyclohexane, methylcyclopentane) was conducted in a 1 L flask equipped with a condensate reflux and mechanical agitation under N2 atmosphere. If not specified, the reaction conditions were as follows: 194.7 mmol cyclic alkanes and 609 mmol 98%H2SO4 were added into flask and stirred firstly, and then 194.7 mmol cyclic alcohols were added dropwise by constant pressure funnel in 30 min at 25 °C, and subsequently the mixture was stirred for another 30 min. After the reaction, the upper organic phase was washed with water and 5% NaOH solution and then dried over anhydrous MgSO4 overnight. It should be noted that in some cases considerable solid coke was produced, so the carbon yield was calculated for each reaction by weighting the mass of recovered organic phase products. The liquid products were analyzed by an Agilent 6890/5975 gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) equipped with HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.5 mm), and a gas chromatograph equipped with a HP-5 capillary column and a hydrogen flame ionization detector (FID). The conversion and selectivity were calculated as follows: C arbon yield ( % ) = ∑ mass of recovered organic phase products ∑ mass of original reactant × 100 Conversion ( % ) = ∑ reactant converted ∑ original reactant × 100 Selectivity ( % ) = ∑ alky - decalins formed ∑ all the products in liquid × 100"
2,Result and discussion,"GC-MS analysis shows branched decalins (Fig. 1 a) are the main products from the reaction of cyclohexanol with methylcyclopentane, and cyclohexene is the only detectable intermediate. So the reaction of cyclohexene with methylcyclopentane was also checked. As shown in Fig. 1b, the product distribution is almost identical to the reaction of cyclohexanol with methylcyclopentane. In both reactions, decalins substituted with two methyl or one ethyl groups (C12 branched decalins) are the major products in the liquid hydrocarbon with weight percent of 83.2%, decalins substituted with one methyl group (C11 branched decalins) and more alkyl groups (C13 branched decalins) are minor products with weight percent of 2.6% and 0.6%, respectively. The formation of branched decalins is believed to be consecutive reactions of dehydration, alkylation, rearrangement and hydrogen transfer as shown in Scheme 1 . At the beginning, cyclohexanol is dehydrated to cyclohexene and then protoned to cyclohexylium ions with the presence of protonic acid (reaction 1). This is followed by the hydride transfer from cyclohexylium ion to methylcyclopentane to produce methylcyclopentan-1-ylium ion and cyclohexane (reaction 2). Subsequently the alkylation occurs between methylcyclopentan-1-ylium ion and cyclohexene, followed with skeleton rearrangement and hydrogen transfer to produce branched decalins (C12) along with a new methylcyclopentan-1-ylium carbocation (reaction 3 and 4. The propagation cycle is terminated through self-alkylation of methylcyclopentan-1-ylium ion with methylcyclopentane by releasing a proton (reaction 5). At the same time, cracking and methyl shifting can occur for the C12 compounds to produce some C11 and C13 products. The dehydration/oligomerization of cycloalcohol can also produce branched decalins (Scheme 2 ). As shown in Fig. 2 , all cyclohexanol is converted quickly, but the carbon yield of liquid product is only 32.7%, and the selectivity of branched decalins is only 31.9%. The reason is that a large amount of cyclohexanol is converted to polymerized molecules and even coke though the rapid polymerization of cyclohexylium ions due to the lack of hydrogen donor. With the addition of cyclohexane to the reaction system, the carbon yield of liquid hydrocarbons and selectivity of branched decalins are increased to 57.3% and 38.0%, respectively. But the conversion of cyclohexane is only 5.2%, so the role of cyclohexane is more likely as solvent to suppress the polymerization. However, when methylcyclohexane is used, both the carbon yield (67.1%) and the selectivity (72.1%) increase obviously, with the considerable conversion of methylcyclohexane as 23.7%, which means methylcyclohexane is more active than cyclohexane in the reaction. Note that, no reaction takes place for methylcyclohexane alone, so the increase in the carbon yield and selectivity mainly attribute to the reaction (reactions 2–4) between methylcyclohexane and cyclohexylium. Additionally, the dilution effect of methylcyclohexane also contributes to suppressing the side polymerization reaction. The carbon yield and selectivity further increase to 76.7% and 76.3% respectively, in the case of methylcyclopentane being used. Also the conversion of methylcyclopentane reaches a higher level of 50.8%, because its five-membered ring has smaller steric hindrance in the reaction compared with the six-membered methylcyclohexane. In addition, the strain of five-membered ring makes the reaction 3 and 4 go smoothly. In this condition, the carbon yield increases to 76.7%. In addition, solid acids including HPW, Nafion, HY and Hβ have also been checked in the dehydration/oligomerization of cycloalcohol (Table S1). Unfortunately, only alkylated products were observed with trace or no decalins detected (Fig. S1), which indicates that the acidity of these solid acids is not strong enough to facilitate rearrangement reaction and hydrogen transfer. Protonic acid is the key to ignite the first step of the reaction, namely dehydration of cyclohexanol to cyclohexene and then generation of cyclohexylium ions, so sufficient acid is necessary to ensure considerable conversion and selectivity. Fig. 3 shows that, with the increase of H2SO4 dosage from 487 mmol to 609 mmol, both the conversion of methylcyclopentane and the selectivity of branched decalins increase because more acid is favorable to both the alkylation and the hydrogen transfer reactions. Further increase of the amount of acid slightly improves the selectivity, while the carbon yield is reduced slightly. The result with different reaction temperature reveals that a mild temperature favors the formation of branched decalins, as shown in Fig. 4 . At 0 °C, the reaction between methylcyclopentane and cyclohexanol takes place hardly as seen by the low conversion of methylcyclopentane, also the product distribution is almost identical to that the dehydration/oligomerization of pure cyclohexanol (GC spectra, Fig. S2). But the carbon yield and branched decalins selectivity are improved to some degree compared with the reaction of pure cyclohexanol, attributed to the aforementioned solvent effect. When the temperature is increased to 10 °C, new products are formed from the reaction of methylcyclopentane with cyclohexanol (GC spectra, Fig. S2), and the conversion of methylcyclopentane and branched decalins selectivity are significantly increased. The reaction at 25 °C is slightly improved as compared that at 10 °C, and almost no change at higher temperature of 35 °C. This suggests the reaction between cyclohexylium ion and methylcyclopentane (reaction 2–4) can take place smoothly at 25 °C. It can be seen that the self-alkylation of cyclohexanol leads to much side-reactions, and a low cyclohexanol/methylcyclopentane ratio is desirable to achieve high carbon yield and high selectivity of branched decalins. So we conducted the reaction by continuous dropping cyclohexanol into methylcyclopentane slowly to keep low cyclohexanol/methylcyclopentane ratio. As shown in Fig. 5 , when both cyclohexanol and methylcyclopentane are added at one time, the reaction is totally the self-alkylation of cyclohexanol with very low conversion of methylcyclopentane, thus both the carbon yield and selectivity of branched decalins are very low. In the case of continuous feeding cyclohexanol, that is, methylcyclopentane and H2SO4 are added in one batch and cyclohexanol is dropped in gradually, the reaction between cyclohexanol with methylcyclopentane is improved greatly, and with the increase of feeding time the conversion of methylcyclopentane, carbon yield and selectivity of branched decalins are all increased continuously. Furthermore, as a demonstration to scale up the reaction, the doubled amount of methylcyclopentane and H2SO4 are added in one batch and then double amount of cyclohexanol is dropped in gradually. In this case the conversion of methylcyclopentane, selectivity of branched decalins and carbon yield can be improved to 64.8%, 85.4% and 86.5%, respectively. It also should be noted that the water produced from the dehydration reaction decrease the concentration of H2SO4, as a result the selectivity of branched decalins is decreased to 66.7% when the catalyst is directly used in the second run. We further explored the reaction with wider range of reactants, including the couplings of cyclohexanol with methylcyclohexane, cyclopentanol with methylcyclohexane, cyclohexanol with methylcyclopentane, cyclopentanol with methylcyclopentane under the optimum condition (i.e. 389.4 mmol cyclohexanol and 389.4 mmol cyclic alkanes, 1.2 mol 98%H2SO4, cyclohexanol added in 240 min at 25 °C). As shown in Table 1 , all the alcohols are completely converted, but the carbon yield and selectivity of branched decalins are higher for the reaction with cyclohexanol. As for the reactivity of alkanes, methylcyclopentane is more active than methylcyclohexane, which results in higher carbon yield and selectivity of branched decalins. Overall, the cyclohexanol/methylcyclopentane coupling is the most effective in producing branched decalins but the cyclopentanol/methylcyclopentane one is the worst. It is also noted that the product distribution of branched decalins is a little different when different reactants are used (Table 1 and Fig. S3). Specifically, the cyclohexanol/methylcyclopentane coupling majorly produces C12 products (96.2%), the cyclohexanol/methylcyclohexane coupling produces C12 (77.5%) but with considerable C13 products (21.0%), the cyclopentanol/methylcyclopentane coupling produces smaller molecules of C11 (87.7%) and C10 products (9.6%), whereas the cyclopentanol/methylcyclohexane coupling produces C12 (79.4%) and some C10 products (20.6%). To explicit the potential of branched decalins as fuel component, the four products synthesized were separated by vacuum distillation for test. Table 2 , Figs. S4 and S5 show they all have high density of 0.88–0.89 g/mL, small viscosity of 21.7–22.5 mm2/s (−40 °C), and super freezing point of less than −110 °C for the fuels produced from cyclopentanol/methylcyclohexane, cyclohexanol/methylcyclopentane and cyclopentanol/methylcyclopentane couplings. The fuel synthesized from cyclohexanol/methylcyclohexane has a relatively high freezing point of -51 °C due to the presence of considerable C13 and C14 compounds. Also the formation of C10 and C11 compounds in cyclohexanol/methylcyclopentane and cyclopentanol/methylcyclopentane systems results in relatively higher density attributed to the very small amount of methyl groups, moreover the comparison between these two systems indicates the C11 has better low-temperature properties, like lower freezing point and smaller viscosity than C12 and C10 compounds."
3,Conclusion,"In summary, we have developed a new and simple route for directly producing branched decalins from cyclic alcohols (cyclohexanol, cyclopentanol) and cyclic alkanes (methylcyclohexane, methylcyclopentane) through alkylation and hydride transfer in a one-pot process at room temperature. During these processes, the cyclic alcohols can be converted completely, and methylcyclopentane is more active to take part in the reaction with high conversion of 64.8%, branched decalins selectivity of 86.5% and carbon yield of 85.4%. Cyclic alkanes not only serve as solvent to prevent coke formation but also take part in the reaction to suppress the self-alkylation of cyclic alcohols. The obtained fuels have high density of ∼0.88 g/mL, small viscosity of ∼22 mm2/s (−40 °C), low freezing point of −51 °C ∼ −110 °C and heat value of ∼37 MJ/L, thus having good potential as advanced jet fuels."
