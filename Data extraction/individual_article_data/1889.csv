0,Introduction,"Interest in hydrogen production by biological processes has been growing in recent times. Among the biological processes for hydrogen production, dark fermentation (DF) has emerged as a preferred one due to the spontaneity of the reaction, faster kinetics, substrate versatility, and ability to function throughout the day (Mu et al., 2006; Nath and Das, 2004). Additionally, DF can also utilize organic waste streams in liquid and particulate forms as feedstock for hydrogen production. However, the hydrogen yield of DF is low because, a large fraction of the energy content of the feedstock ends up as alcohols and volatile fatty acids in the aqueous phase (Xie et al., 2008a,b; Van Ginkel and Logan, 2005; Wang et al., 2008). From a stoichiometric perspective, the theoretical hydrogen yield, Y, from pure feedstock such as glucose or sucrose assuming complete conversion with acetic acid as the aqueous end product can be estimated as 4M H2/M glucose and 8M H2/M sucrose, respectively. Yet, typical yields measured under laboratory conditions have been 30–50% of the theoretical hydrogen yield due to alcohol and acid formation. From an energy conversion perspective, the theoretical energy conversion efficiency in the case of glucose is about 33.5% (Xie et al., 2008a). Recent research efforts have focused on improving the practical yield by DF. Common approaches that have been proposed include culture manipulation such as use of high-hydrogen-producing cultures or metabolic engineering of H2-producing cultures; feedstock manipulation such as optimizing initial concentration, pretreatment, and nutrient augmentation; pH manipulation including initial pH adjustment and/or continuous pH control; head space pressure manipulation via intermittent vs. continuous pressure release, drawing vacuum, or gas-sparging; and high temperature operation. A good number of reviews of those approaches by different researchers have been published (Nath and Das, 2004; Das, 2009; Hallenbeck, 2009; Wang and Wan, 2009). In this study, feedstock manipulation was evaluated as a means to improve the viability of DF on the basis of net energy gain rather than on the basis of hydrogen yield as had been done up to now. The net energy gain is the energy that can be generated from the hydrogen less the total energy expended in mixing the reactor contents, heat-treatment of the seed, and raising the temperature of the feedstock to the operating temperature. Majority of dark fermentation studies have been done at mesophilic temperatures requiring external heat energy for maintaining the reactor temperature. Many of those studies had utilized heat-treatment of the seed to suppress methane formers, requiring additional heat energy. In addition, certain amount of energy has to be expended for mixing the reactor contents. Thus, the energy analysis of the DF process has to include these energy requirements to assess the net energy gain by the process. Since the aim of the study is to evaluate the feedstock effect and compare the results to literature studies all of which have used mixing, the energy required for mixing was not considered in the net energy gain analysis. Many studies have evaluated the effects of initial feed concentration with and without co-substrates to maximize hydrogen yield. For instance, Skonieczny and Yargeau (2009) evaluated the effect of initial COD concentration of glucose blended with synthetic wastewater at various pH values, and concluded that higher COD concentrations generally resulted in higher hydrogen production at each pH tested. Venkata Mohan et al. (2007) compared hydrogen production from synthetic chemical wastewater as the primary carbon source with glucose and domestic sewage as co-substrates. They reported that hydrogen production from the reactors fed with the co-substrates was higher than that from glucose alone. In this study, it is hypothesized that dairy cattle manure, currently one of the largest waste streams in the crop and livestock industries, could be used as an amendment to sugary wastes to improve the hydrogen yield. The premise of this hypothesis is that cattle manure can provide macro and micronutrients (ammonia, phosphorous, potassium, metals) required for bacterial growth. Robbins et al. (1979) have reported that, dry manure includes ether extract (2.5–2.8%), total nitrogen (2%), ammonia as N (0.5%) and acetic acid as VFA (0.1%). A second premise is that, cattle manure could provide the buffering capacity necessary to maintain an optimal pH of 5–6 for DF without any initial pH adjustments or continuous pH control (Perera and Nirmalakhandan, 2010). The third premise is that dairy wastes could serve as co-substrate because of its organic content (Hills, 1980). Organic content of cattle manure has been reported to include cellulose (∼28%), hemicelluloses (∼28%) and lignin (∼12%) (Robbins et al., 1979; Ong et al., 2000). The proposed hypothesis was tested in batch experiments with dairy cattle manure as the supplement and sucrose as the primary carbon source. A fourth premise is that native micro-flora in cattle manure could include hydrogen producing organisms. This premise is based on the results of previous study by Perera and Nirmalakhandan (2010). The goals of this study were to (i) evaluate experimentally, the feasibility of improving the net energy gain from sucrose by DF using organic wastes as co-substrates; and (ii) assess theoretically, the PEEG that can be extracted from the end products of DF via AD and MFC; and (iii) compare estimates of PEEG from these experiments with estimates made from literature reports."
1,Theoretical background,
2,Energy content of hydrogen produced by DF,"2.1 Energy content of hydrogen produced by DF The energy that can be generated from the hydrogen produced by the DF process E df [kJ/g COD feedstock] can be estimated as: (1) E df = G ρ H 2 ( LHV H 2 ) / VC where, G is the volume of hydrogen produced [L]; ρ H 2 is the density of gaseous hydrogen [8.9×10−5 kg/L]; LHV H 2 is the lower heating value of hydrogen [120,000kJ/kg]; V is the liquid volume in the reactor [L]; and C is the COD concentration of the feedstock [g COD/L]."
3,Energy consumed for maintaining fermentation temperature,"2.2 Energy consumed for maintaining fermentation temperature Heat energy required E f [kJ/g COD feedstock] to raise the reactor contents from ambient temperature [T a] to the fermentation temperature [T f] can be found from: (2) E f = V ρ w c p,w ( T f - T a ) / VC where, V is the volume of liquid in the reactor, assumed to be water [L]; ρ w is the density of water [=1kg/L]; c p,w is the specific heat of reactor contents [=4.2kJ/kg-K]; and C is the COD concentration of the feedstock [g COD/L]."
4,Energy consumed for pretreatment,"2.3 Energy consumed for pretreatment Heat energy required E p [kJ/g COD feedstock] for pretreatment of the seed can be estimated from (3) E p = mc p,s ( T p - T a ) 10 - 3 where, m is the mass of seed per unit mass of feedstock [g/g COD of feedstock] and c p,s is the specific heat [kJ/kg-K] of seed that is pretreated by heat treatment and added to the reactor; and T p is the temperature at which the heat treatment is done."
5,Net energy gain,"2.4 Net energy gain Assuming negligible heat loss, the net energy gain by the process E n [kJ/g COD feedstock] in batch reactors can therefore be estimated from: (4) E n = E df - ( E f + E p ) Most dark fermentation studies have reported hydrogen yield, Y, in terms of mole hydrogen produced per mole feedstock. The net energy gain defined above can be estimated from the reported yields from the following equation: (5) E n = YCkV ( LHVH 2 ) ( MW H 2 / MW f ) 10 - 3 VC - ( E f + E p ) where, k is the COD equivalent of the feedstock (g feedstock/g COD), and MW is the molecular weight. In this study, T a was set equal to the Standard Ambient Temperature of 25°C. From Eqs. (2), (3), and (5), it can be deduced that lower fermentation temperatures and higher feedstock concentrations can be beneficial in improving the net energy gain per unit mass of the feedstock. It can also be noted that if the seed is pretreated by methods other than heat-treatment (E p =0), the net energy gain could be higher. Many researchers have resorted to fermentation at above-ambient temperatures and higher initial COD levels to increase the yield. Faster reaction rates and hence smaller reactor volumes, improved hydrogen yield, and suppression of solvent producers and inhibitory effects of volatile fatty acids have been cited as justifications for fermentation at higher temperatures. Smaller reactor volumes and hence lower heating energy have been cited as justifications for higher feedstock concentrations (Das and Veziroglu, 2001; Wang et al., 2008; Mu et al., 2006; Nath et al., 2006; Gilroyed et al., 2008). But, high-temperature fermentation may result in negative net energy gain if the improvement in hydrogen yield is not high enough to offset the energy required to heat the reactor (Perera et al., 2010). On the other hand, higher COD levels can lower the hydrogen yield and net energy gain due to substrate inhibition (Ezeji et al., 2004) while increasing the feedstock cost. Thus, it is necessary to optimize these process modifications in terms of net energy gain. The effect of initial sucrose concentration on hydrogen yield at a fixed temperature of 35°C has been evaluated by Kim et al. (2006a). In that study, anaerobic digester sludge was used as seed, which was heat-treated at 90°C prior to seeding the reactor. Their results were extended in this study to estimate the net energy gain as a function of initial sucrose concentration. Hydrogen yield reported by Kim et al. (2006a) and the net energy gain estimated by us using Eq. (5) are plotted as a function of initial sucrose concentration in Fig. 1 . In plotting the net energy gain, two cases were considered- one including heat treatment and another excluding heat treatment. As can be noted in Fig. 1, hydrogen yield increased with initial sucrose concentration up to 30g COD/L and dropped thereafter, with further increase of sucrose concentration. The net energy gain was mostly negative over the range of initial concentrations tested (10–60g COD/L) even when the energy required for heat treatment was not included, because the heat energy required to raise the temperature of the feed to 35°C is more than what could be derived from the hydrogen generated. In a study of hydrogen production from glucose at concentrations ranging from 10–40g/L, Su et al. (2009) found similar reduction in hydrogen yield as the concentration exceeded 20g/L. To verify whether the improvement in hydrogen yield by DF through above-ambient temperature operation and high feedstock concentrations is justifiable or not, net energy gain was estimated from literature data on DF of sucrose and glucose at different temperatures and initial feedstock concentrations. The results of this evaluation summarized in Fig. 2 indicate that higher temperatures and/or higher feedstock concentrations tested in the past have not always translated into positive net energy gain by DF because of energy required to heat the reactors on one hand, and the formation of alcohols and acids, on the other. From this evaluation, it can be deduced that, for the DF process to be sustainable and economically viable, input of all material and energy resources should be as low as possible and additional energy should be extracted from the end products to the extent possible."
6,Improving net energy gain,"2.5 Improving net energy gain One approach to improve the energy efficiency and the net energy gain is to recover additional energy from the end products of dark fermentation by follow-up processes such as: photofermentation to produce additional hydrogen (Su et al., 2009); anaerobic digestion (AD) to produce methane (Xie et al., 2008a); or microbial fuel cells (MFC) to produce electricity (Oh and Logan, 2005). The energy efficiency of such two-step configurations could be as much as 89% (Xie et al., 2008a,b). When certain waste organic materials are used as feedstock for DF, photofermentation may not be a feasible follow-up process, because the color of the effluent may result in rapid light extinction. As such, the analysis in this study is limited only to AD and MFC. Since different DF test conditions result in different hydrogen yields and different end products at different concentrations, the potential for electrical energy gain (PEEG) is proposed as a metric to compare, rationalize, and corroborate results from sources. The PEEG from DF, DF+AD, and DF+MFC under different test conditions can be readily estimated if the hydrogen volumes and the concentrations of the end products of DF are known."
7,Estimating potential for electrical energy gain (PEEG),"2.6 Estimating potential for electrical energy gain (PEEG) In the case of DF, PEEG can be estimated considering fuel cells (FC) to convert the energy content of hydrogen to electricity at an assumed efficiency of η FC =65% (Rittman, 2006). (6) PEEG DF = η FC E n In the case of AD, PEEG can be estimated considering anaerobic digestion of the volatile fatty acids and alcohols in the effluent of DF to produce the methane for driving an internal combustion engine (ICE) coupled to an alternator. The methane generation potential of the volatile acids and alcohols in the effluent of DF can be estimated from stoichiometry. Typical efficiency η IC of the ICE/alternator combination to convert the lower calorific value of methane to electrical energy can be taken as 30% (Rittman, 2006). (7) PEEG AD = η IC ∑ a i p i LHV CH 4 10 - 3 VC where, a i is the methane potential of aqueous end product i (g CH4/g product i), p i is the mass of end product i (g); and LHV CH 4 is the low heat value of methane (=50,000kJ/kg). Since typical anaerobic digestion temperature, T d is about 35°C, some energy will be required to raise the temperature of the effluent of the DF process to the digestion temperature, if the DF temperature is less than 35°C. In such cases, Eq. (7) has to be amended as follows: (8) PEEG AD = η IC ∑ a i p i LHV CH 4 10 - 3 - V ρ w C p,w ( T d - T f ) VC In the case of MFC, PEEG can be estimated from the ΔG values for the end products, assuming an efficiency η MFC of 60% (Rittman, 2006). (9) PEEG MFC = η MFC ∑ p i Δ G i 10 - 3 VC where ΔG i is the Gibbs free energy of product i (kJ/kg). Even though this is a simplified approach for estimating PEEG, it provides a rational basis to compare results obtained under different test conditions."
8,Methods,
9,Reactor set up,"3.1 Reactor set up Average of one to two days-old screened cattle manure was obtained from the waste pile of a nearby dairy farm. Manure samples were spread to a thickness of 1cm in aluminum trays and heat-treated for 2h at 104°C and allowed to reach ambient temperature to inhibit methanogens (Oh et al., 2003). Serum bottles (250mL) were used as batch reactors with liquid volume of 150mL. Five sets of reactors (R1–R5) were set up in triplicate with different amounts of manure: 2.5g in R1; 5.0g in R2; 10.0g in R3; 15.0 in R4; and 20.0g in R5. All five reactors were supplemented with 0.67g of sucrose to attain 5g COD/L for testing different sucrose-to-manure ratios: 26.8% in R1; 13.4% in R2; 6.7% in R3; 4.5% in R4; and 3.4% in R5. The manure-to-liquid ratios (MLR) in the reactors were: 6.1% in R1; 12.2% in R2; 24.3% in R3; 36.2% in R4; and 48.0% in R5. These ratios were selected based on preliminary tests done at various ratios to assess the optimal range for hydrogen production. The reactors were operated without any external seeding, pH adjustments, gas-sparging or buffers, under ambient temperature (25°C) with continuous stirring at 150rpm using magnetic stirrers."
10,Analytical methods,"3.2 Analytical methods Gas volume was measured by releasing the pressure intermittently (daily) using the reversible displacement method (Gadhamshetty et al., 2009). Gas samples were collected from the headspace of the reactors using a gas tight syringe and analyzed with gas chromatograph (GC) (SRI Instruments, model 8610, Torrence, CA) equipped with molecular sieve column (Alltech Molesieve 5A 80/100 6ft×1/8ft×0.085) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Temperatures of injection point, oven, and detector were 100, 70, 100°C, respectively. Argon was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 30mL/min. The GC is capable of analyzing hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and methane. Biogas volume of 0.5mL was extracted from the headspace of the reactors with a gas tight syringe, and injected into the GC for analysis. Three samples were analyzed from each reactor and averaged. Liquid samples were drawn daily from the reactors with a gas tight syringe were analyzed for pH, COD and reducing sugar, once in 2days. Cole Parmer electrode probe was used to measure pH and COD was measured using Hach Standard Method. Reducing sugar was analyzed by the di-nitro salycilic acid (DNS) assay. Concentrations of acetate, butyrate, propionate and ethanol were measured using gas chromatograph (SRI Instruments, model 8610A, Torrence, CA) with a flame ionization detector (FID) (Alltech AT-Steel P/W Haysep q 80/1, 6×1/8ft×0.085) using helium as carrier gas. The operational temperature of injector port, oven and the detector were 200, 200 and 220°C, respectively. Injection volume was 1μl from filtered liquid sample."
11,Results and discussion,"Volume of hydrogen and mass of aqueous end products produced in the five test reactors at sucrose:manure ratios ranging from 3.4% to 26.8% are presented in Table 1 . Estimates of PEEG per unit g sucrose fed to DF by DF, DF+AD, and DF+MFC at those ratios are also summarized in Table 1. In these estimates, the specific heat of manure was calculated using heat balance equation given by Nayyeri et al. (2009)."
12,Manure as a nutrient source,"4.1 Manure as a nutrient source Previous studies had shown that hydrogen could not be produced from pure sucrose, unless supplemented with required nutrients in sufficient quantities (Perera and Nirmalakhandan, 2010). In that study, the control reactor, which was fed with sucrose and seeded with hydrogen-producing cultures did not produce any significant biogas or hydrogen (<21mL with hydrogen content <12%). Results from reactors R1–R5 in the current study, which produced much higher biogas volumes (>300mL with high hydrogen content >50%) without any other nutrient supplements confirm the first premise that cattle manure as a supplement could provide the nutrients necessary for hydrogen production from sucrose."
13,Manure as a buffering agent,"4.2 Manure as a buffering agent Methane was not detected in any of the reactors. While the heat treatment of the manure helped suppress methane formers, the fact that the pH in all the reactors (Fig. 3 ) remained below the favorable range for methane formation (Speece, 1996) further ensured that hydrogen-consuming methane formers were inhibited throughout the process. pH of all the reactors remained between 4.0 and 5.5 except in R1 (Fig. 3). Within the first 24h, the pH in all reactors increased from the initial pH of 4.1 with increase of cattle manure content. Except in reactor R1, pH in all the other reactors stabilized within the optimal range reported in literature for fermentative hydrogen production. While most studied had resorted to initial pH adjustment or continuous pH control to achieve the optimal pH range for hydrogen production (Van Ginkel et al., 2001; Hwang et al., 2004; Kawagoshi et al., 2005), the pH profiles in these reactors remained within the optimal range in spite of continued acid production by DF. This observation and the fact that the pH profiles are consistent with the manure supplement added to the reactors affirm the second premise that manure is able to provide buffering to maintain pH without any external pH management. The decrease in pH in R1 is attributed to the limited buffering capacity of the small amount of manure added to this reactor. This conclusion is further confirmed by the results of the reducing sugar analysis, which showed that 50% of the readily degradable sugar remained in R1 reactor while more than 95% of the sugar was consumed in the other four reactors."
14,Hydrogen yield,"4.3 Hydrogen yield The hydrogen yields (M H2/M sucrose added) at different manure supplements are presented in Table 1. Even though all the reactors were dozed with the same amount of sucrose (0.67g), the yields in reactors R1–R4 increased from 3.1 to 5.3M H2/M sucrose with manure supplement as the manure:liquid ratio increased from 6% in R1 to 36% in R4. However, in reactor R5, at the manure:liquid ratio of 48%, the yield dropped somewhat to 4.6M H2/M sucrose. The yields found in this study are compared in Fig. 4 with the yields reported in the literature on the basis of initial mass of sucrose added. For this comparison, the ten literature studies that had positive net energy gain in Fig. 2 were selected. This comparison suggests that higher initial concentrations and/or higher temperatures do not necessarily translate to higher yields. These results support the third premise that dairy cattle manure could serve as a low-cost co-substrate to improve hydrogen yield from sugary wastes. Even though none of these reactors were inoculated with hydrogen-producing seeds, the high productivity in all these reactors validated the fourth premise that heat-treated manure by itself is enriched with native hydrogen-producing microflora, corroborating the results reported by Perera and Nirmalakhandan (2010)."
15,Net energy gain,"4.4 Net energy gain Hydrogen volumes generated in this study were extended to estimate the net energy gain by the DF process, E n, as outlined in the theoretical section, under two scenarios: one excluding the energy input for heat-treatment of the manure (E p =0) and another, including the energy input for heat-treatment of the manure (E p from Eq. (3)). As can be seen from Table 1, in the first case, the trend of net energy gain followed that of hydrogen yield, increasing with manure supplement up to 15g in R4 and dropping when the manure supplement increased to 20g in R5. As mentioned earlier, this decrease in energy is attributed to lower yield resulting from poor mixing. Nevertheless, the net energy gain was positive at all manure supplementation levels because, these reactors were run at 25°C, requiring no energy input for heating the feedstock. In the second case, when the energy required for preheating the manure is included, the net energy gain decreased with increase of manure supplement; the net energy gain was positive in R1 and R2 reactors, while that in R3, R4, and R5 reactors was negative. Even though higher manure levels improved the hydrogen yield, the higher energy needs for pre-heating the manure resulted in negative net energy gain. From these results, it can be concluded that pretreatment by methods other than heat-treatment would be preferable to achieve higher net energy gains from dark fermentation."
16,"PEEG from DF, DF+AD, and DF+MFC","4.5 PEEG from DF, DF+AD, and DF+MFC Estimations of the potential for electrical energy generation (PEEG) via the following options are summarized in Table 1 for the five reactors: Option A1: electrical energy via fuel cells (FC) fed with the hydrogen produced by DF, excluding energy for heat-treatment of manure. Option A2: electrical energy via fuel cells (FC) fed with the hydrogen produced by DF, including energy for heat-treatment of manure. Option B: electrical energy via internal combustion engine/alternator (ICE) fed with methane produced by AD of end products of DF. Option C: electrical energy via microbial fuel cells (MFC) fed with the end products of DF. Option A1+B: electrical energy via fuel cells (FC) fed with the hydrogen produced by DF, excluding energy for heat-treatment of manure+electrical energy via internal combustion engine/alternator (ICE) fed with methane produced by AD of end products of DF. Option A2+B: electrical energy via fuel cells (FC) fed with the hydrogen produced by DF, including energy for heat-treatment of manure+electrical energy via internal combustion engine/alternator (ICE) fed with methane produced by AD of end products of DF. Option A1+C: electrical energy via fuel cells (FC) fed with the hydrogen produced by DF, excluding energy for heat-treatment of manure+electrical energy via microbial fuel cells (MFC) fed with the end products of DF. Option A2+C: electrical energy via fuel cells (FC) fed with the hydrogen produced by DF, including energy for heat-treatment of manure+electrical energy via microbial fuel cells (MFC) fed with the end products of DF. In Option A, PEEG values directly followed the trend E n: when the energy for heat-treatment is excluded (A1), the maximum PEEG was 2.7kJ/g in R4; when the energy for heat-treatment is included (A2), the maximum PEEG was 0.9kJ/g. In Option B, PEEG increased with manure content was negative. Increased manure levels contributed to increased aqueous end products that were amenable to anaerobic digestion. However, since the end products from DF were at ambient temperature, the heat energy required to raise their temperature to the digestion temperature of 35°C resulted in net negative electrical energy generation potential. In Option C, the PEEG increased with manure levels, and was positive in all reactors. The positive net electrical energy generation by MFC is attributed to its higher efficiency and its ability to function at ambient temperatures. PEEG values estimated for DF+AD and DF+MFC, excluding and including the energy required for heat-treatment are compared in Fig. 5 . Of the scenarios considered here, the potential for electricity generation is highest in the case of dark fermentation followed by microbial fuel cells. This comparison, although based on simplified theoretical estimates, shows that manure as a low-cost supplement can be beneficial in improving the energy conversion efficiency by the DF process, if non-thermal pretreatment methods could be utilized instead of heat-treatment. Based on the results presented in Table 1, dark fermentation followed by anaerobic digestion could be a feasible option, if waste heat is available for raising the temperature of the products of DF to the digestion temperature."
17,Comparison with literature results,"4.6 Comparison with literature results Data from the limited number of literature studies that had reported the mass of end products were selected to estimate PEEG in those studies for comparison with those found in this study. All the studies selected for this comparison had used heat-treatment of the seed to suppress methanogens; however, sufficient data were not included in those studies to estimate the heat energy input for heat-treatment. As such, this comparison was done excluding the energy for heat-treatment, considering AD as the follow-up process. In addition, since different studies had used different test conditions, the PEEG values were normalized relative to the working volume in the reactors. From comparison shown in Fig. 6 , PEEG values found in R4 and R5 reactors can be seen to be significantly higher than those reported by others. The higher PEEG values found in this study are due to the low fermentation temperatures and the additional hydrogen produced from the manure; while the lower values in the literature studies are due to DF under mesophilic temperatures. However, it has to be noted that, to benefit from this finding, the manure has to be pretreated with non-thermal pretreatment methods such as acid treatment."
18,Conclusions,"This study demonstrated the feasibility of improving hydrogen yield from dark fermentation of sucrose supplemented with dairy cattle manure. Results of this study indicated that, dairy cattle manure as a supplement could provide not only the organisms and nutrients but also buffering capacity to maintain optimal pH for hydrogen production, while serving as a co-substrate to increase the hydrogen yield. Compared on the basis of net energy gain and the potential for electrical energy generation, the combination of dark fermentation and microbial fuel cells appears to be the most energy-efficient one."
