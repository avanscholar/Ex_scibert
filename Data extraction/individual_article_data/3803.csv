0,Introduction,"Liver diseases are important health problems worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the deadliest cancers, and chronic excessive alcohol use is a major cause of illness and death from chronic liver disease (Yoon et al., 2012; McKim et al., 2002). The life-threatening liver diseases caused by alcohol abuse—fatty liver (steatosis), hepatitis, and cirrhosis—are associated with alcohol abuse (You et al., 2018). Alcohol metabolism changes the redox state of the liver, leading to alterations in the hepatic metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, and uric acids. This induces a wide spectrum of hepatic damage, the most characteristic of which are persistent inflammation and interference with lipid metabolism (Gyamfi & Wan, 2010). In the liver, alcohol is metabolized to acetaldehyde, which interacts with cellular macromolecules such as lipids and proteins, leading to damage to membrane lipids and modulation of enzyme activities. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), and catalase (CAT) catalyze the conversion of alcohol to acetaldehyde (Quertemont, 2004). ADH catalyzes the formation of acetaldehyde from alcohol with simultaneous reduction of NAD+ to NADH, which elevates xanthine oxidase activity and so increases production of superoxides (Lieber, 2005). CYP2E1 is involved in the microsomal alcohol oxidizing system, which connects the oxidation of alcohol and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. CAT also oxidizes alcohol into acetaldehyde concurrently with a decomposition of H2O2 (Lieber, 2004). It is worth noting that ethanol can be converted by one of those three enzymes, independent of each other, not as a logical 'pathway' or a three-step procedure involving all three enzymes (Fig. 3). Experimental and clinical studies show that alcohol-induced oxidative stress is an early step in the development of liver diseases. Several pathways contribute to alcohol-induced oxidative stress; one of the most important is the induction of CYP2E1 by alcohol, leading to lipid peroxidation in hepatocytes (Han et al., 2015). CYP2E1-mediated oxidation drives the formation of metabolites such as acetaldehyde and reactive oxygen species (ROSs), which contribute to the clinical and pathological spectra of alcohol-associated hepatotoxicity (Jin, Ande, Kumar, & Kumar, 2013). The pathogenesis of alcohol-induced liver diseases is mediated not only by oxidative stress, but also by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signaling (Gao & Bataller, 2011), whereas alcohol toxicity is associated with activation of transcription of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), resulting in the expression of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines (e.g., TLR4, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12), chemokines, lipid mediators, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (Iimuro, Gallucci, Luster, Kono, & Thurman, 1997; Mandrekar & Szabo, 2009). Long-term alcohol consumption can also increase hepatic lipogenesis and result in the accumulation of fat droplets in hepatocytes, which may render the liver more susceptible to oxidative stress. Fatty liver is characterized by the accumulation of triglycerides due to alcohol-induced increased fat synthesis. Chronic alcohol ingestion increases the level of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), a master transcription factor that regulates the expression of several lipogenic enzymes, including fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (Han et al., 2015). Many natural products have been reported to inhibit the effects of ingested alcohol, thus providing an alternative to synthetic medicines for preventing alcohol-provoked liver injury and dysfunction (Bourogaa et al., 2013). Herbal medicines have been used for thousands of years and show promise for treating medical illnesses or improving physical performance. The root of Panax ginseng C.A. Mey (hereafter referred to as ginseng) has been used as an herbal medicine for over 2000 years in Asian countries, including China, Korea, and Japan, and is believed to exert beneficial effects on health and to promote longevity. Recently, intensive biochemical and molecular studies have demonstrated the pharmacological effects of ginseng on the central nervous system and cardiovascular, endocrine, and immune systems, as well as against various cancers (Ellis & Reddy, 2003; In et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2012). These studies suggested that the preventive effects of ginseng are due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and cytoprotective activities, which are associated with beneficial effects on liver function and against liver disease. For instance, ginseng wine, in a special application form used in traditional Chinese medicines, is commonly used as a folk remedy to treat a variety of diseases in China. However, the specific soaking method used in its production and the mechanism(s) of its effects are unclear. The main bioactive compositions of ginseng are triterpene saponins, termed ginsenosides, which are considered to be responsible for a variety of pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-tumor, and anti-aging activities (In et al., 2017, Xie et al., 2012). Up to now, more than 150 ginsenosides have been detected in the genus Panax (Christensen, 2009). According to their aglycone structures, ginsenosides are divided into three groups: dammaranes, ocotillols, and oleananes. The dammarane triterpenes to which most ginsenosides belong can be generally further classified as protopanaxadiols (e.g., Rb1, Rb2, Rb3, Rc, Rd, Rg3, and Rh2) and protopanaxatriols (e.g., Re, Rf, Rg1, Rg2 and Rh1) (Qi, Wang, & Yuan, 2011, Yang et al., 2015). Transcriptomics analysis provides a large amount of information that can be used to predict the roles of individual genes activated in response to external stimuli. It can collect almost all of the transcription sequence information of a tissue or an organ of a species quickly and comprehensively. Many studies have successfully used transcriptome analysis to screen for differentially expressed genes and the related mechanisms (Srivastava, George, & Karuturi, 2019; Henry, Furtado, & Rangan, 2018). Here, we investigated the effect of ginseng wine on subchronic alcohol-induced liver injury and the underlying molecular mechanism by performing a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals and reagents,"2.1 Chemicals and reagents Authentic standard ginsenosides Rh2, 20(S)-Rg2, F1, Rd, Rb1, Rb2, Rf, 20(S)-Rg1, Rb3, Rc, 20(S)-Rh1, 20(R)-Rh1, 20(R)-Rg2, 20(S)-Rg3, 20(R)-Rg3, CK, 20(S)-PPT, and Re were purchased from Lyle Biological (Luoyang, Henan, China), and F4 and Rg5 from Mansite Biological (Chengdu, Sichuan, China). HPLC-grade acetonitrile was from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Other reagents (analytical grade) were from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Xicheng, Beijing, China). Ultra-pure water was prepared using a Milli-Q50 SP Reagent Water System (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA)."
3,Preparation of ginseng wine and HPLC analyses of ginsenosides,"2.2 Preparation of ginseng wine and HPLC analyses of ginsenosides To prepare ginseng wine containing high levels of ginsenosides, we optimized the following conditions: form of ginseng to be soaked (whole or sliced root), alcohol concentration (35, 45, or 55%; similar to commodity ginseng wines), solid/liquid ratio (g dry weight [d.w.]/mL) (1:20 or 1:30 ginseng/alcohol ratio), and soaking time (1–42 days). Experiments were conducted in triplicate, and roughly 25 g d.w. of ginseng was soaked for each treatment. HPLC was performed using a Shimadzu HPLC system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with two LC-10AT VP pumps, a SPD-M20A ultraviolet detector, and a SIL-20AC TH autosampler controlled by analytical software (LC Solution-Release 1.23SP1). A reversed-phase column (Diamonsil C18 5 μm 250 × 4.6 mm i.d., Dikma, Beijing, China) was used for separation, and the column temperature was set at 25 °C. The solvent system comprised water (A) and acetonitrile (B), with the following gradient program: 0 min, 21% B; 0–14 min, 21% B; 14–24 min, 30% B; 24–55 min, 32% B; 55–75 min, 33% B; 75–100 min, 35% B; 100–120 min, 37% B; 120–130 min, 60% B; 130–140 min, 70% B; and 140–150 min, 80% B. The flow rate was 0.8 mL/min and the injection volume was 10 µL. The detection wavelength was set at 203 nm to enable the monitoring of multiple ginsenosides simultaneously (Li et al., 2018). To identify the ginsenosides in ginseng wine, a stock solution of 20 mixed authentic standards was prepared, and 2-, 4-, 6-, 10-, 16-, and 20-μL volumes of these were injected for assessment of linearity. Linearity (R2 > 0.999) was established within the range of 0.88–10.8 μg with high precision, stability, and repeatability (all relative standard deviations < 5%) for each of the 20 ginsenosides."
4,"Mice and RNA extraction, library construction, and sequencing","2.3 Mice and RNA extraction, library construction, and sequencing The animal model was based on previous literatures with slight modifications (Xiang, Zhu, Li, & Ling, 2012; Zhao, Chen, & Li, 2008). Kunming mice purchased from Huafukang Biotechnology Company (Changping, Beijing, China) were housed in individually ventilated cages and maintained on a 12-h dark/light cycle in a temperature-controlled laboratory animal house (24 °C, 50% humidity) on our campus, and had ad libitum access to food and water. After 7 days acclimation to a liquid diet, all mice (6–8 weeks old) were randomly divided into three groups (n = 8 each); the control group (CG), alcohol group (AG), and ginseng wine group (GG). The mice were intragastrically administered distilled water, 55% alcohol, or ginseng wine at 20 mL/kg per day, respectively. After feeding for 4 weeks, the animals were euthanized and liver tissue was removed and stored at −80 °C for transcriptomic analyses. Animal procedures were conducted according to protocols approved by the Animal Ethics Committee, Beijing Forestry University, and all efforts were made to minimize the pain and suffering of the animals. The sampled complete and/or incomplete liver tissues from the eight mice in each intervention group were put together and divided randomly into three portions. After mixing completely, total RNA from each of the three portions was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA degradation and contamination were assessed in 1% agarose gels, and their concentrations were measured using a Qubit RNA Assay Kit in a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). A total amount of 3 mg of RNA was used as input material for each of the RNA preparations. Finally, three samples with RNA integrity number (RIN) values above 8 were used for library construction. Sequencing of the libraries was performed using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s recommendations, and four index codes were added to attribute a sequence to each sample. Briefly, mRNA was purified from total RNA using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. Fragmentation was conducted using divalent cations at an elevated temperature in a proprietary Illumina fragmentation buffer. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using random oligonucleotides and SuperScript II. Second-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using DNA polymerase I and RNase H. Remaining overhangs were converted into blunt ends by adding an exonuclease and polymerase. After adenylation of the 3′-ends of the DNA fragments, Illumina PE adapter oligonucleotides were ligated to prepare for hybridization. To select cDNA fragments 200 bp in length, the library fragments were purified using an AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, MA, USA). DNA fragments with ligated adaptor molecules on both ends were selectively enriched using an Illumina PCR Primer Cocktail in a 10-cycle PCR. Products were quantified using an ABI StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA, USA) and an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). The clustering of index-coded samples was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation System using a TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After cluster generation, the library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform."
5,Gene annotation and expression profiling,"2.4 Gene annotation and expression profiling After sequencing, raw reads were cleaned by removing adapter and low-quality sequences using SeqPrep and Sickle software. The obtained clean reads were subsequently mapped to a known mouse genome (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release89/fasta/mus_musculus/dna/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa.gz) by sequence alignment using TopHat2 software and then assembled as genes using Cufflinks software. Next, all genes were functionally annotated via gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway databases using the Blast2GO (https://www.blast2go.com/) and KAAS (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/kaas/) software, respectively. In addition, the COG, NR, SWISS-PROT, and PFAM databases were used to generate the data presented in the Supplementary Materials. Expression of the annotated genes was profiled by calculating the fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) values, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by comparing their FPKM values using edgeR software (version 3.8.2); P < 0.05 and a false discovery rate < 0.05 were considered indicative of statistical significance. Subsequently, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed based on these DEGs using Goatools (https://github.com/tanghaibao/Goatools) and KOBAS (http://kobas.cbi.pku.edu.cn/home.do), respectively."
6,Validation of DEGs by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting,"2.5 Validation of DEGs by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting The DEGs identified by transcriptome sequencing analysis were validated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) using an Applied Biosystems 7900 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Foster, CA, USA). Primers spanning exon-exon boundaries were designed for qRT-PCR, which was performed using Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) and SYBR Green (Bioneer Inc., Seoul, Korea). The housekeeping gene β-actin was used for normalization of the data. The sequences of the primers used are listed in Table 2. The expression level of a gene in a given sample was represented as 2−ΔΔCt, where ΔΔCt = [ΔCt (experimental)] − [ΔCt (medium)] and ΔCt = [Ct (experimental)] − [Ct (housekeeping)]. Whole liver tissues were homogenized in a PRO-PREP Protein Extraction Solution (iNtRON Biotechnology Inc., Seongnam, Korea). A total of 20 μg of whole protein was used for determination of the CAT and SREBP-1C levels. NE-PER (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA) was used for extraction of nuclear and cytosolic proteins according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The protein samples were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes using a semi-dry transfer process. Next, the membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% (w/v) skim milk powder in TBS. The blots were subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies against CAT and SREBP-1C (1:1000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). On the following day, the primary antibody was removed, and the blots were washed with TBS/T (0.1% Tween 20 in TBS), followed by incubation with the appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The binding of all antibodies was detected using an ECL detection system (iNtRON Biotechnology Inc., Kirkland, WA, USA). The intensity of the immunoreactive bands was determined using TotalLab TL120 software (Nonlinear Dynamics Ltd., Newcastle, UK). Specificities of the antibodies used in our study are described in the instruction of the purchased antibodies."
7,Statistical analysis,"2.6 Statistical analysis All experiments in this study were conducted in triplicate, the results were expressed as mean ± SD, and the data were analyzed by SPSS software (version 17.0, Chicago, USA) and Excel 2016. Comparisons across groups were performed with SPSS 17.0 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) after homogeneity of variance testing, and means were compared by Tukey’s test. Confidence levels for statistical significance were set at a P value < 0.05."
8,Results and discussion,"Alcohol abuse has become a major social as well as clinical problem, with 20% of alcoholics developing fibrosis and subsequent cirrhosis, neither of which have an acceptable cure unless liver transplantation is carried out (Hines & Wheeler, 2004). The liver is the major site of xenobiotic metabolism and excretion, accounting for 90% of alcohol metabolism, thus it is the organ most adversely affected by excessive consumption of alcohol. Alcohol absorbed by the intestinal tract gains access first to the liver, resulting in a variety of liver ailments (Bourogaa et al., 2013). However, for most alcoholics or for some traditional cultural considerations, drinking seems inevitable. Therefore, trying to reduce the damage of liver is urgently needed to avoid the health hazards associated with alcoholism."
9,Optimization of soaking conditions,"3.1 Optimization of soaking conditions To make ginseng wine with the most species and the highest content of ginsenosides, we optimized the four factors as follows: alcohol concentration, 55%; material to liquid ratio, 1:20; a form of ginseng, whole ginseng; and soaking time, 36 days. Fig. 1 B shows the HPLC profile of ginseng wine made using the optimized conditions, from which a total of 11 ginsenosides, all of them being polar (as indicated by their occurrence at the left side of the profile), were identified and quantitated using 20 authentic ginsenoside standards as references (Fig. 1A). No less-polar ginsenosides were detected in the ginseng wine (Fig. 1B), implying that up to 55% ethanol did not induce transformation of polar ginsenosides into less-polar ginsenosides. Next, we analyzed the ginsenoside species and contents of ginseng wine up to day 42; the optimal values of the other three factors were used. The ginsenosides remained nearly indissoluble until day 6; subsequently, the total content of the 11 ginsenosides increased linearly to 3.91 mg/mL up to day 36 and leveled off thereafter (Fig. 1C). Fig. 1D shows the concentrations of the 11 individual ginsenosides during soaking. The final concentrations of Rg1, Re, Rb2, and Rh1 were 1.68, 0.83, 0.45, and 0.31 mg/mL, respectively. Negligible levels of the other seven ginsenosides were detected (total content, 0.64 mg/mL [16.79%])."
10,Validation of transcriptomic data,"3.2 Validation of transcriptomic data 3.2.1 Comparison of transcriptome profile with the reference mouse genome The mouse-liver gene expression profiles were assessed by constructing and sequencing total-liver-tissue cDNA libraries using the Illumina Hiseq4000 platform. Liver tissues of CG, AG, and GG mice yielded 49.790, 47.861, and 47.876 million raw reads, respectively, and had a total length of 21.83 Gbp (Table 1 ). After trimming of low-quality reads and adaptor sequences, 48.460, 47.086, and 46.813 million clean reads remained, respectively, and had a total length of 21.35 Gbp (97.80% of the raw reads). To validate these transcriptional profiles, the data were subjected to sequence alignment with a reference mouse genome. The numbers of total reads mapped to the reference sequence (mapped reads in Table 1) were 40.227, 41.961, and 42.059 million, which accounted for 83.01%, 89.11%, and 89.85% of the total mapped reads in CG, AG, and GG mice, respectively. In addition, the numbers of clean reads possessing unique and multiple locations on the reference genome, and those mapped to the positive and negative strands of the reference genome (reads mapped to + and −, respectively) were obtained (Table 1). These results showed that the transcriptome data were suitable for analysis. 3.2.2 GO, KEGG, and COG functional annotations To further validate the transcriptomic data, we exploited the GO, KEGG, and COG databases to analyze the genetic annotation of the reads mapped to the reference genome. GO analysis annotated 13,616 genes that could be further assigned into three main categories, of which 8345, 10,015, and 11,705 were included in “cellular component”, “molecular function”, and “biological process”, respectively (Fig. S1). We next conducted a KEGG biological pathway analysis (Fig. S2). In total, 13,029 genes were assigned to 290 KEGG pathways and were categorized into the following five functional categories: “cellular processes”, “environmental information processing”, “human diseases”, “metabolism”, and “organismal systems.” In a COG analysis, 6387 hits were assigned to 26 functional classifications (Fig. S3). And NR, SWISS-PROT, and PFAM databases were also used to provide supplementary information, and they annotated 22,221, 22,127, and 20,132 genes, respectively. Therefore, a large number of genes were accurately annotated, providing support for subsequent experiments."
11,Ginsenosides ameliorate alcohol-induced liver injury,"3.3 Ginsenosides ameliorate alcohol-induced liver injury 3.3.1 DEGs in the liver tissues of CG, AG, and GG mice Next, we compared the transcriptome profiles of the liver tissues of CG, AG, and GG mice. In total, 701 genes in the liver tissue of AG mice were differentially expressed (over 1.5-fold, P value < 0.05) compared to in CG mice, among which 385 genes were upregulated and 316 were downregulated (Fig. 2 A). Nine hundred eighty-one DEGs were identified in GG compared to CG mice (458 and 523 genes up- and down-regulated, respectively), and 638 DEGs in GG compared to AG mice (272 and 366 genes up- and down-regulated, respectively) (Fig. 2A). To evaluate the mechanism by which ginsenosides influence alcohol-induced liver injury, we subjected the 638 DEGs in GG compared to AG mice to GO analysis using the DAVID database with the default parameters. The 272 up- and 366 down-regulated DEGs were enriched mainly in the terms “oxidation-reduction process”, “catalytic activity,” and “lipid biosynthetic process” (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the ginsenosides ameliorated the alcohol-induced liver damage. In the liver, alcohol is metabolized to acetaldehyde, which interacts with and damages cellular macromolecules (Niemelä, 1999). Chronic and excessive ethanol consumption impairs fat oxidation, stimulates lipogenesis, and causes sustained inflammation by interfering with the hepatic metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, and uric acid (You & Crabb, 2004). Fat accumulation in the liver increases its sensitivity to the second round of effects that lead to inflammatory damage to hepatocytes (Roberto et al., 2013). Oxidative stress, endotoxins, and cytokines are the agents of the second round of effects and are related to the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (Yoon et al., 2012). Next, we assessed the main genes and pathways related to the effect of the ginsenosides on alcohol-induced liver injury by KEGG analysis; the results were verified by qRT-PCR and western blotting. Table 2 shows the qRT-PCR primer sequences. 3.3.2 Ginsenosides in ginseng wine regulated the three main enzymes in alcohol metabolism Alcohol is metabolized in liver to acetaldehyde mainly via three enzymes: ADH, CYP2E1, and CAT (Fig. 3 A). The Adh1 mRNA level was higher in AG and GG mice (FPKM values, 1871 and 787, respectively) than in CG (719) mice (Fig. 3A). Therefore, subchronic alcohol ingestion significantly (2.6-fold; P < 0.05) increased the Adh1 mRNA level; this enhancement was significantly reduced (to 1.3-fold) by the ginsenosides. Similarly, the mRNA level of Cyp2e1 was significantly (3.7- and 2.5-fold) upregulated in AG (4021) and GG (2566) mice compared to CG (1086) mice, and it can be inferred that enhancement of the alcohol-induced Cyp2e1 mRNA level was also reduced by the ginsenosides. The Cat mRNA level was upregulated 1.3-fold in AG, and was upregulated significantly 3.1-fold in GG compared to CG mice. The transcriptome data were validated by qRT-PCR. The results were consistent with the mRNA sequencing data; i.e., the relative expression of Adh and Cyp2e1 was decreased but that of Cat increased in GG compared with AG mice (Fig. 4 A). According to the western blot data, the hepatic CAT protein level was significantly increased in GG compared to AG mice (Fig. 4B). Therefore, ginsenosides may accelerate ethanol metabolism to prevent peroxide accumulation and ameliorate liver damage. The results of catalase with increased levels in GG compared to AG might as well suggest that GG caused more ROS and thus more catalase was needed to restore proper homeostasis. However, a large number of literatures have proved that the majority of ginseng’s pharmacological activities were closely linked to its antioxidant property (Zhang et al., 1996; Keum et al., 2000; Kitts, Wijewickreme, & Hu, 2000; Bae & Lee, 2004). And it has also been revealed by pharmacological investigations that ginseng extract and/or some of its ginsenosides exert hepatoprotective effects against oxidative stress (Voces et al., 1999; Xie et al., 2006). Therefore, the hypothesis that ginseng wine might cause increased ROS levels in the liver is probably unfounded and unlikely. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3A, acetaldehyde can be sequentially oxidized to acetic acid in the alcohol metabolism. However, for the step of acetaldehyde being oxidized to acetic acid, there were no pathways of concern were significantly affected by the treatments in our transcriptome analysis (data not shown). 3.3.3 Ginsenosides suppressed alcohol-induced enhancement of lipogenesis Chronic alcohol ingestion increases hepatic lipogenesis, resulting in the accumulation of fat droplets in hepatocytes, rendering the liver more susceptible to oxidative stress. SREBP-1, one of the SREBPs which are basic transcription factors known mainly for their control of genes that govern biosynthesis of cholesterol and fatty acid and control the expression of genes involved in lipogenesis, such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA synthetase, and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase. In addition, they can induce the expression of ATP-citrate lyase, malic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. These enzymes generate NADPH and cytosolic acetyl-CoA, which are essential for lipogenesis (Horton, Goldstein, & Brown, 2002; Brown & Goldstein, 1997). The lipogenic role for SREBP-1 was underscored in vivo by the elevation of fatty acid biosynthesis and triglycerides levels in the livers of transgenic animals, which overexpressed either the mature form of SREBP-1a or SREBP-1c (Shimano et al., 1997). Shimomura, Bashmakov, and Horton (1999) also suggested that increased levels of nuclear SREBP-1c contribute to the elevated rates of hepatic fatty acid synthesis that lead to steatosis in diabetic mice. CD36, also known as fatty acid translocase (FAT), is a free-fatty-acid uptake transporter. Upregulation of hepatic CD36 expression causes lipid deposition, while its downregulation suppresses hepatic lipid accumulation (Miquilena-Colina et al., 2011). The mRNA levels of Srebp-1c and Cd36 were significantly (2.1- and 2.2-fold) higher in AG mice (FPKM values 1700 and 1783) and 1.4- and 1.1-fold higher in GG mice (791 and 864) than in CG mice (565 and 831), respectively (Fig. 3B). qRT-PCR confirmed that Srebp-1c expression was decreased in GG compared to AG mice (Fig. 4A); this was verified at the protein level by western blotting (Fig. 4B). Therefore, the ginsenosides suppressed lipogenesis in mice with the alcohol-induced liver injury. 3.3.4 Ginsenosides suppressed the alcohol-induced increase in oxidative stress Oxidative stress is a feature of alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity and contributes to the progression of alcoholic liver injury by causing hepatocellular damage and increasing the inflammatory response (Lieber, 2004). CYP2E1 generates ROS (such as the superoxide anion radical and hydrogen peroxide) and, in the presence of iron catalysts, produces powerful oxidants such as the hydroxyl radical (Lu & Cederbaum, 2008). ROS overproduction due to upregulation of CYP2E1 can cause peroxidation of membrane lipids, damage to proteins and nucleic acids, and disrupt the oxidant-antioxidant balance. Alcohol intake may induce the activation of CYP2E1, resulting in the production of ROS and oxidative stress (Cederbaum, Lu, & Wu, 2009; Louvet & Mathurin, 2015). Under normal physiological conditions, the hepatic antioxidant system prevents excess oxidative stress, but this system can be impaired by heavy alcohol consumption (Hagymási, Blazovics, & G., Kocsis. I., Fehér, J. , 2001). The Cyp2e1 mRNA level was significantly upregulated (3.7-fold) in AG mice and upregulated (2.5-fold) in GG mice compared to CG mice (FPKM values, 4021 and 2566, respectively, vs. 1086). The Gsta2 mRNA level was significantly upregulated (2.1-fold) in AG mice (1376) and upregulated (1.2-fold) in GG mice (869) compared to CG (724) mice (Fig. 3B). qRT-PCR showed that the increase in the Gsta2 mRNA level was of lesser magnitude in GG mice than in AG mice (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that the antioxidant properties of ginsenosides might be related to their amelioration of alcohol-induced liver injury. 3.3.5 Ginsenosides ameliorate alcohol-induced damage by an anti-inflammatory effect Chronic alcohol intake can increase the plasma levels of endotoxin/LPS in the portal circulation, resulting in activation of Kupffer cells (KC) via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α (Szabo & Bala, 2010). LPS recognition by TLR4 results in recruitment of the adaptor molecules myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF), which activate NF-κB (Takeda & Akira, 2004). Activation of NF-κB increases the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, enzymes such as COX-2, and adhesion molecules (Yoon et al., 2012). The Tlr-4 mRNA level was significantly upregulated (2.5-fold) in AG mice and upregulated (1.5-fold) in GG mice compared to CG mice (FPKM values, 1685 and 1053, respectively, vs. 674) (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the ginsenoside Re reportedly suppresses the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and NF-κB activation by inhibiting the binding of LPS to TLR-4 on immune cells (Shin et al., 2006). Consistent with the RNA sequencing data, the upregulation of the Tlr-4 mRNA level in GG mice was of lesser magnitude than that in AG mice (Fig. 4A). Together, these results suggest that ginsenosides ameliorate liver injury by suppressing TLR-4 expression."
12,Conclusions,"We conclude first that the optimum combination of conditions for making ginseng wine was: 55% alcohol, 1:20 material to liquid ratio, whole ginseng root, and soaking for 36 days. Moreover, 55% ethanol did not induce transformation of polar into less-polar ginsenosides. Transcriptome data showed that after subchronic consumption of alcohol, the expression of genes (Cyp2e1 and Adh1) involved in the metabolic pathway of alcohol to acetaldehyde were increased while those changes were significantly attenuated by ginseng wine except Cat, thus we speculated that ginseng wine could accelerate the metabolism of ethanol by strengthening the catalase pathway and suppress CYP2E1 and ADH pathway to prevent peroxides accumulation thereby decreased the damage to the liver. Additionally, subchronic alcohol consumption also increased the expression levels of genes related to SREBP-1C, GSTA2 and TLR4, which are the important transcription factors involved in lipogenesis, oxidative stress and inflammatory, respectively. And these increases in expression were also attenuated by ginsenosides. Overall, our findings demonstrated that the ginsenosides in ginseng wine ameliorated alcohol-induced liver injury, possibly by regulating the expression of the enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism, as well as modulating oxidation, inflammation, and lipogenesis."
