0,Introduction,"Chronic alcohol consumption is a major risk factor leading to several diseases and disorders which include alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and coronary heart disease (CHD) [1]. Enhanced oxidative stress, generation of free radicals, increased lipid peroxidation, overproduction of nitric oxide and derangements in metabolism led to alcoholic damage and related diseases [2,3]. Liver is the principal organ affected by alcohol consumption as it is the primary site for alcohol metabolism. Alcohol initiates several signalling pathways in which reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) plays central role [4]. Moreover, alcohol-induced excessive ROS/RNS generation could react with cellular macromolecules by inactivating enzymes, denaturing proteins and causing DNA damage [5]. Earlier studies revealed that chronic alcohol consumption creates imbalance between antioxidant and proxidants in liver [6]. Since the importance of alcohol-induced oxidative/nitrosative stress in the pathogenesis of ALD is well recognised thereby effective treatments are necessary for alcohol related diseases [7]. As people are addicted to alcohol use and are unable to quit its consumption, the best way to reduce the burden of alcohol related diseases and deaths is the development of therapeutic strategies. In this scenario, people are looking for herbal medicines for the treatment of alcohol related diseases. Phyto-extracts of medicinal plants has synergistic effects in exerting protective effects and management of oxidative stress caused by free radicals by attenuating the amount of lipid and protein oxidation in tissues [8,9]. Moreover, antioxidative mechanisms of herbal medicines play a major role in protecting the liver against alcohol-induced damage. Eighty percent of global population still relies on medicines based on herbal drugs [10,11]. Studies on several herbal extracts have modulated oxidative/nitrosative stress and organ damage induced by alcohol [12,13]. In modern science, the effective medicine that can protect from various liver diseases without side effects are not available. So, it is necessary, to discover the new natural medicines to treat liver disorders more efficiently. Pterocarpus santalinus, is a small to medium sized deciduous tree belong to Fabaceae family. It is widely distributed in the tropical regions of the world, especially in India, Sri Lanka, Taiwan and China [14]. Recent reviews explored the phytochemistry, pharmacology and ethnomedicinal values of P. santalinus [14,15]. P. santalinus extract showed anti-microbial [16], antioxidant [17], hepato-protective [18], anti-diabetic [19], gastro-protective [20] and wound healing mechanisms [21]. Also available literature demonstrated the presence of several phytocompounds components in heartwood powder in particular santalin A, B and Y, pterocarpol, pterocarptriol, isopterocarpalone, pterocarpodiolone, cryptomeridol and several non specific compounds such as isoflavones, isoflavonoid glucosides, triterpenes, sesquiterpenes, β-sitosterol, lupeol, epicatechin, lignans and pterostilbeans [22,23]. Since, it is a valuable source of various phyto-compounds, we hypothesized that P. santalinus can be used as an effective therapeutic agent against various ailments. Hence, the present study was designed to study the therapeutic potential of P. santalinus against alcohol-induced oxidative/nitrosative stress and hepatic damage in rats."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Preparation of extract,"2.1 Preparation of extract Heartwood powder of P. Santalinus was purchased in local market and was used to prepare P. santalinus heartwood extract (PSE). Heartwood powder was placed in mixture of methanol and sterile distilled water (80:20, V/V) for 48h and the mixture was thoroughly stirred until extract has been dissolved. The mixture was then centrifuged at 2500rpm for 10min and the supernatant was filtered and evaporated to dryness at 45°C with a rotary evaporator. The extract was dissolved in distilled water and then used for experimentation."
3,Animals,"2.2 Animals Two month old male albino Wistar rats weighing 120–140g were procured from Sri Venkateswara agencies, Bangalore, India. Animals were maintained on a standard pellet diet (M/s. Hindustan Lever Ltd., Mumbai, India) and water ad libitum with 24h light-dark cycle in University animal house. After acclimatization for a week, animals were divided into four groups (n =8) viz., group-I, served as controls, group-II, alcohol, group-III, PSE alone and group-IV, alcohol and PSE. Alcohol (20%) was administered at a dose of 5g/kg b.wt/day, PSE was administered at a dose of 250mg/kg b.wt/day. Control rats received iso-caloric glucose instead of alcohol. All treatments were given orally using intubation tube for a period of 60days. Experimentation and animal maintenance were done with prior approval of institutional animal ethics committee. At the end of experimental period the animals were fasted over night and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Immediately blood was collected into heparinised tubes by cardiac puncture and plasma was separated by centrifugation at 3000rpm for 10min. Liver tissue was collected and stored at −80°C until assays were carried out. A part of liver tissue was fixed in 10% neutral formalin solution for histo-pathological analysis."
4,In vitro assays,"2.3 In vitro assays Phytochemical screening of the plant extract which include alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, tannins, saponins, glycosides and terpenoids were carried out as described previously [24]. The radical scavenging effect of PSE was demonstrated by using standardized methods as described previously [25]. The ability for scavenge the stable free radical, DPPH was measured as a decrease in absorbance at 517nm and the percentage of inhibition was calculated. Nitric oxide (NOx) produced from sodium nitroprusside was measured by Griess reaction [26]. The absorbance of the chromophore formed during diazotization of nitrite with sulphanilamide and subsequent coupling with naphthalene diamine was read at 546nm and percentage of inhibition was calculated."
5,In vivo studies,"2.4 In vivo studies 2.4.1 Measurement of plasma marker enzymes and lipid profile Plasma aspertate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and gamma glutamyl transferase (γGT) levels, total cholesterol (TC), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) were determined by using commercially available kits (Span diagnostics, Surat, India) as described previously [27]. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) were calculated by using the formula of Friedewald et al. [28]. 2.5 Measurement of lipid peroxides and nitric oxide levels Lipid peroxidation extent was measured both in plasma and liver as described previously [29]. Total NOx in the form of nitrite and nitrate levels in plasma and liver was measured by the method of Sastry et al. [30]. 2.6 Assays of enzymic and non-enzymic antioxidants in liver Liver tissue was homogenized (10% w/v) in tris buffer (0.1M, pH 7.4), centrifuged (10,000x g for 20min at 4°C) and the supernatant was used for all the biochemical parameters. Total glutathione (GSH) content was measured by the method of Ellman’s [31] and the activities of glutathione reductase (GR) [32], glutamine-s-transferase (GST) [33], glutathione peroxidise (GPx) [33], catalase [34] and superoxide dismutase (SOD) [35] were determined. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. [36]. 2.7 Western blot analysis Rat liver was homogenized in radio immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing 50mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 150mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.4% deoxy cholate, 1% NP-40 containing protease inhibitors including 1mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF), and phosphatase inhibitors including 10mM β-glycerophosphate, 10mM NaF, 0.3mM Na3VO4 and 0.3mM aprotinin. The lysate was sonicated and centrifuged at 14,000x g for 15min at 4O C. Cellular protein was mixed with SDS sample buffer subjected to electrophoresis and transferred onto PVDF membranes. After blocking the PVDF membrane in non-fat dry milk (5%) in Tris buffered saline (TBS) for 1h at room temperature, membranes were incubated for overnight with iNOS (Cat# N32020; Transduction laboratories, Lexington, USA) and Tubulin (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) primary antibodies. Then, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG conjugated to HRP) for 1h at room temperature. Before and after incubation with secondary antibodies, membranes were washed with TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20. Membranes were analyzed quantitatively by means of image J software (NIH). 2.8 Histopathological studies A portion of liver was dissected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution for 24h as described by Raghuramulu et al. [37]. The fixed tissue was processed routinely, and then embedded in paraffin, sectioned to 3–5μm thickness, deparaffinised and rehydrated using standard techniques. Morphological changes in liver sections were observed by staining with hematoxylin and eosin. 2.9 Statistical analysis Data were subjected to statistical analyses values are mean±SD of 8 rats in each group. Student t-test followed by Duncan’s Multiple Range (DMR) test followed by one-way ANOVA was performed to find out significant difference between groups. A p <0.05 was considered statistically significant."
6,Results,"In vitro phytochemical analysis of Pterocarpus santalinus heartwood extract (PSE) revealed the presence of alkaloids, phenols, tannins, flavonoids, saponins, glycosides and triterpeniods. Significant phytocompounds and their chemical structures presented in Fig. 1 . Fig. 2 a and b represents the increased 1,1- diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) and nitric oxide radical scavenging activity of PSE compared with synthetic antioxidant butylated hydroxy toulene (BHT). The percentage of DPPH and nitric oxide radical scavenging activities were increased with an increase in concentrations (5–25μg/ml) and maximum scavenging activity was showed at 25μg/ml. The hepato-protective effect of PSE against alcohol-induced liver damage in rats was presented in Table 1 . Alcohol-induced liver damage is evidenced from the leakage of liver marker enzymes into plasma. Alcohol administered rats showed significant increase in the levels of plasma AST, ALT, ALP, LDH and γGT enzymes compared with other groups. Administration of PSE to alcohol administered rats significantly decreased these enzyme levels close to normal values. The effect of PSE on alcohol-induced alterations in plasma lipids and lipoproteins were represented in Table 2 . A significant increase in plasma levels of TC, LDL-C, VLDL-C and TG was observed whereas, reduced HDL-C level were observed in alcohol administered rats compared to other experimental groups. These lipids and lipo protein alterations were restored closer to normal levels in PSE and alcohol administered rats. TBARS levels were used as an index of lipid peroxidation in plasma and liver, the data were presented in Fig. 3 (a) and (b). Administration of PSE to alcohol administered rats significantly (p <0.05) prevented the elevation in TBARS level in comparison with alcohol alone administered rats. Nitrite and nitrate levels are an index of NOx production. NOx levels were measured in plasma and liver and the data were presented in Fig. 4 (a) and (b). Alcohol administered rats showed significant increase in plasma and liver NOx levels. However, administration of PSE to alcohol administered rats significantly prevented the elevation of NOx levels in both plasma and liver. iNOS protein expression was analyzed by using western blotting and the data was presented in 4(c). Data revealed that more than 2.5 fold increase in iNOS protein expression was observed in alcohol alone, PSE and alcohol administered rats. However, administration of PSE alone did not show significant change in iNOS expression compared to controls. The effect of PSE on enzymic and non enzymic antioxidants in alcohol administered rats were summarised in Table 3 . The activities of antioxidant enzymes viz., GPx, GST, GR, SOD, catalase and the content of GSH was markedly decreased in alcohol administered rats in comparison to the other experimental groups. Treatment of PSE to alcohol administered rats significantly (p <0.05) increased these levels close to normal levels. Alcohol-induced histological changes in liver tissue were presented in Fig. 5 . Microscopic examination of liver sections of alcohol fed rats showed degeneration of tissue and necrotic changes with distortion of normal architecture, prominence and widening of liver sinusoids were observed in comparison with other experimental groups. Administration of PSE to alcohol administered rats rectified these histopathological alterations in liver."
7,Discussion,"In this study, phytochemical screening of extract showed presence of alkaloids, phenols, glycosides, flavonoids, saponins and terpenoids. Higher free radical scavenging and inhibition of nitric oxide production activity of PSE was observed as dose dependent manner. Phenolic and flavonoid compounds were reported as scavengers and inhibitors of lipid peroxides as well as nitric oxide production [20,38]. Elevated levels of serum hepatic marker enzymes are indicative of loss of functional integrity of cell membranes and cellular leakage. Transaminases (ALT and AST) are located in cytoplasm and mitochondria of hepatocyte, and are better markers for detecting liver damage [39]. ALP is a membrane bound enzyme, LDH is an intracellular enzyme and γGT is a microsomal brush border enzyme found notably in liver. In the present study plasma ALT, AST, ALP, LDH and γGT levels were increased in alcohol administered rats when compared to other groups of the study. Administration of PSE to alcohol administered rats showed significantly lowered concentrations of these plasma liver marker enzymes. Chronic alcohol-induced generation of ROS/RNS and increased lipid peroxidation products would have created damage to the hepatocyte membrane and resulted in the leakage of liver marker enzymes into the circulation. Phenolic compounds lignans, pterolinuses and stilbenes present in PSE might have played effective role in stabilising the hepatocyte membrane damage induced by alcohol. Chronic alcohol consumption enhances the accumulation of lipids in liver which act as a stimulus for secretion of lipoproteins into blood and resulting in the alterations of lipids and lipoprotein pattern. In this study, plasma lipids and lipoproteins were increased in alcohol administered rats which were restored by the administration of PSE near to normal. And also decreased HDL levels were hiked by the administration of PSE to alcohol administered rats. Chronic alcohol consumption increases the biosynthesis and decreases the catabolism of lipids resulting in hyperlipidaemia. Alcohol consumption increases HMG-CoA reductase activity, which catalizes the rate limiting step of cholesterol biosynthesis [40]. Moreover, chronic alcohol consumption blocks the secretion of VLDL and decreases the transportation of triglycerides and release of free fatty acids from lipoproteins [41]. Phyto-extracts contain several active components acting on different molecular targets/sites in a coordinated fashion at various levels at a time to rendering the protection or ameliorating the alcohol-induced damage [42,43]. Phenolic compounds lignans, and stilbenes present in PSE might have played a role in decreasing the expression of key enzymes involved in the lipid biosynthesis and prevented the accumulation of fatty acids and triglycerides in liver. Lipid peroxidation is one of the main manifestations of alcohol-induced oxidative damage and has been found to play important role in the progression ALD. Chronic alcohol consumption induced oxidative damage by producing hydroxyl radicals, superoxide anions, nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxides [39]. Polyunsaturated fatty acids present in the membrane are chief targets for alcohol-induced generation of ROS/RNS [5]. In this study, plasma and liver homogenate showed significantly increased TBARS levels from alcohol administered rats when compared to controls. Administration of PSE to alcohol administered rats significantly lowered these lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels and brought near to normal levels. Moreover, alcohol consumption enhanced the NOx production in both plasma and liver, which is due to the increased iNOS activity. Our data reveals that, chronic alcohol consumption augmented the iNOS protein expression more than 2 fold, whereas the administration of PSE could not affect iNOS protein expression at transcriptional or translational level. The restoration of nitrite/nitrate levels would be attributed to strong nitric oxide scavenging activity of PSE. And also from our observations we can suggest that PSE exhibit potent free radical scavenging activity which can prevent the further steps involved in the disease progression. Increased NOx reacts with superoxide and produces peroxynitrite (ONOO-), a potent oxidant causing nitrosation of tyrosine resulting inactivation of several proteins and enzymes [44]. Phenolic compounds intercept the free radical chain propagation by donating hydrogen atom and forming a stable product which prevent further oxidation of lipids. Generally phyto-compounds neutralizes free radicals, quenching oxygen, inhibiting oxidative enzymes like CYP450, chelating metal ions and maintain cell membrane integrity [45]. Probably, the phyto-compounds present in PSE might have played a role in the restoration of TBARS and NOx levels to normal levels. Endogenous antioxidant enzymes include SOD, CAT, GST and GPx constitute a mutually supportive team of first-line of defence against oxidative damage [46]. These antioxidants plays an important role in scavenging ROS, reduction of hydrogen peroxide and maintaining redox balances in biological system. In this study, the enzymic antioxidants GPx, GST, GR, SOD and CAT were significantly decreased in alcohol administered rats which were restored near to normal by the administration of PSE to alcohol administered rats. Furthermore the content of GSH was significantly decreased in alcohol administered rats when compared to control rats on other hand administration of PSE to alcohol administered rats improved the GSH content near to normal levels. GSH, non-enzymic antioxidant act as direct ROS scavenger and plays an important role in protecting the cells against lipid peroxidation [47]. The decreased content of GSH might be due to the increased leakage of γGT, a liver marker enzyme which plays essential role in GSH metabolism by transferring glutamyl moiety to a variety of acceptors leaving cysteine product to preserve the intracellular homeostasis of oxidative stress [48]. Multiple phyto-compounds present in PSE might have involved in maintaining membrane integrity thereby prevented the leakage of liver marker enzymes and restored the GSH content in the liver. Several reports revealed that chronic alcohol administration to rats significantly decreased enzymic and non-enzymic antioxidants in liver and were restored by the administration of several phyto-extracts [49,50]. Antioxidants are regulated by regulatory proteins like nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) which induces the expression of antioxidant response element (ARE) which in turn enhances the expression of antioxidant enzyme genes [51]. Studies on phyto-compounds explored the role of phenols and tri-terpenoids in the activation of Nrf2 [52]. The restoration of antioxidant status against alcohol-induced alterations by PSE might have attributed to activation of antioxidant regulatory proteins, detoxifying metabolic products which exert potent free radical scavenging activity. Alcohol-induced fatty liver can progresses into advanced stages of ALD i.e., steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma [53]. In this study liver histopathological changes in alcohol administered rats showed tissue congestion, necrotic changes and vacuolization in hepatocytes. Alcohol-induced liver damage by ROS/RNS was evidenced from the spill of liver marker enzymes and hyper-lipidemea which was further confirmed by the histopathological changes. Administration of PSE to alcohol administered rats showed near to normal hepatic architecture. Phenolic compounds reported to reduce the formation of hepatic stellate cells and fibrous connective tissue [54]. Based on our studies we concluded that PSE has shown strong therapeutic potential against alcohol-induced hepatic damage by reducing the formation of ROS/RNS followed by enhancing antioxidant status of the liver. Therapeutic properties of phyto-compounds present in PSE have probably shown a concerted mode of action and conferred protection against alcohol-induced damage."
