0,Introduction,"Bioremediation is a technology that has been applied to remove pollutants in the environment. The technology requires enzymes to catalyze biodegradation or transformation of the compounds reducing their toxicity. Laccases, oxidoreductive enzymes produced by various bacteria, fungi and insects, are among effective enzymes for biotechnological applications (Viswanath et al., 2014; Loera et al., 2006; Morozova et al., 2007). Among these, laccases from white rot fungi are well-known and popularly used in bioremediation (Viswanath et al., 2014). Typically, these fungal laccases are extracellular proteins involving in carbohydrate degradation, pigment formation and detoxification (Loera et al., 2006). Laccases are capable of catalyzing oxidation of various organic compounds including phenols, aminophenol, methoxyphenol, aromatic amines, acids, alcohols and synthetic polymers (Giardina et al., 2010; Madhavi and Lele, 2009; Fabbrini et al., 2001; Majcherczyk et al., 1999; Nishida et al., 2001). In scrutiny, these laccases catalyze four single-electron oxidations in concurrent with substrate reduction to four-electron reductive cleavage of the dioxygen bond with four Cu atoms (Giardina et al., 2010). Laccase is an effective biocatalyst with various applications including bioremediation, chemical synthesis, paper pulp bleaching and wine stabilization (Kunamneni et al., 2008). However, the application of the enzymes for environmental remediation is still limited due to the cost, recovery, recycling and stability of the enzyme (Arregui et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2011). Alternatively, immobilization of laccase on inert or insoluble materials may be applicable for effectively continuous treatment of contaminants since enzymes are reusable. This strategy is able to prolong the working life of enzymes, increase their stability, and applicable for effective and economical treatment of various organic compounds including phenolic substrates, catechol, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and dyes (Fernandez-Fernandez et al., 2013; Pang et al., 2015; Lante et al., 2000; Li et al., 2018; Jankowska et al., 2019). Immobilization of laccase can be performed by various methods including adsorption, entrapment, encapsulation, covalent binding and self-immobilization (Fernandez-Fernandez et al., 2013). Moreover, many supports have been used to be the base for enzyme attachment. Among these supports, nanoparticles, e.g. nano-sized zinc oxide, provide large surface area reducing mass transfer resistance for substrate and allowing a higher enzyme loading (Husain et al., 2011; Misson et al., 2015). Since zinc oxide nanoparticle is considered the richest nanostructured material with biocompatibility and stability properties, it is extensively used in biotechnology and medical science (Wahab et al., 2012; Kołodziejczak-Radzimska and Jesionowski, 2014). Zinc oxide is one of cheap materials and excellent reducing agent for ecological pollutants and environmental remediation (Haq et al., 2017). Zinc oxide nanoparticle also provides a variety of structures with potential applications in many fields of nanotechnology (Kołodziejczak-Radzimska and Jesionowski, 2014). Previous study demonstrated that porous zinc oxide nanoparticle provides a great substrate to support stabilization of laccase with improved temperature stability (Ghorbani et al., 2018). Although the suspended zinc oxide nanoparticle is a good support for enzyme immobilization, the suspended zinc oxide nanoparticles with enzymatic activity could overflow from the bioprocess, resulting in the decrease in efficiency of the bioreactor to remove organic compounds. Using zinc oxide nanoarray, which is fixed on the glass and covalently binds to enzyme, possibly minimizes, and prolongs the use of the enzyme in the reactor. Tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA), an aliphatic alcohol, is a pollutant often detected in water environments. The contamination of this compound has been usually due to the intensive use of TBA as an industrial solvent directly used in manufacture of perfumes, paint removes, methacrylate, floatation agents, pharmaceutical, wax, lacquer, cleaning agents and food flavorings, and improper disposal of the TBA-containing waste (Deeb et al., 2003). TBA is also known as a denaturant for ethanol which is an octane booster in unleaded gasoline (Deeb et al., 2003). TBA is also an intermediate or a feedstock in production of fuel oxygenates including MTBE and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) as well as a by-product from biodegradation of MTBE and ETBE under anaerobic conditions (Deeb et al., 2003; Wilson, 2003). TBA is; hence, usually detected in groundwater plumes where gasoline is spilled or leaked from storage tanks as well as in urban run-off (Deeb et al., 2003). TBA is a contaminant of concern due to its toxicity and possible carcinogenicity (Cirvello et al., 1995; McGregor, 2010). Due to its possible adverse health effects and cancer risks, California has set drinking water notification level and response level of 12 and 1200 µg/L for TBA, respectively (California Environmental Protection Agency and Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment OEHHA, 1999; California State Water Resources Control Board and Division of Drinking Water, 2020). In this study, we developed, characterized and evaluated the efficiency of immobilized laccase on zinc oxide nanostructure to catalyze biodegradation of TBA in comparison to the suspended enzyme. Kinetic parameters of both suspended and immobilized laccase as well as the repeatability testing of immobilized laccase were also established. The knowledge from this study is useful for assessing the possibility of using laccase and immobilized laccase on remediation of TBA."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals 3-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), 25% glutaraldehyde (GLU), 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS), TBA, zinc acetate dihydrate, zinc nitrate hexahydrate, hexamethylenetetramine, monoethanolamine, 2-methoxy ethanol, sulfuric acid, 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and laccase from Trametes versicolor (with the enzyme activity of 1.03 U/mg) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO)."
3,Zinc oxide nanoarray fabrication,"2.2 Zinc oxide nanoarray fabrication Zinc oxide seed layer preparation and nanoarray growth were conducted based on the modified method of Vasudevan et al. (2011). The detailed procedures are described as follows. 2.2.1 Preparation of zinc oxide seed layer To prepare zinc oxide seed layer, 0.43 g zinc acetate dihydrate and 0.12 mL monoethanolamine were mixed in 3.88 mL of 2-methoxy ethanol. The solution was stirred at 60 °C for 30 min to produce a homogenous zinc oxide sol gel. Then, 20 µL of the sol-gel was used to prepare zinc oxide seed layer on 19.4 cm2 glass slide (7.62 cm length x 2.54 cm wide) by convective deposition at speed of 750 µm/s. Finally, the coated glass slide was annealed at 300 °C for 30 min prior subsequent use. 2.2.2 Zinc oxide nanoarray growth Zinc oxide hydrothermal solution was prepared by dissolving 0.743 g (2.5 mmol) zinc nitrate hexahydrate and 0.350 g (2.5 mmol) hexamethylenetetramine in 100 mL deionized water. The solution was diluted with deionized water at a ratio of 1:4 (v/v) to obtain 100 mL diluted solution in Duran® glass bottle. The glass slide coated with zinc oxide seed layer was; then, soaked in prepared solution, incubated in convection oven at 90 °C for 3 h, rinsed with deionized water and dried at 60 °C for 30 min prior use in surface modification step. The morphology and elemental information of zinc oxide nanoarray was investigated by a Quanta FEI 450 scanning electron microscope (SEM) with and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (Field Electron and Ion Company, OR). Moreover, zinc oxide on the glass slide were structurally characterized using both Bruker D8 Advance X-ray Diffractometer (XRD) with CuKα radiation of wavelength 1.5418 Å (Billerica, MA) and PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR spectrometer) equipped with a solid-state attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory (PerkinElmer Inc., MA). All the infrared spectra presented in this study have been made on samples scraped from glass slides and embedded in KBr matrix."
4,Surface modification of zinc oxide nanostructures,"2.3 Surface modification of zinc oxide nanostructures Surface structure of zinc oxide was functionalized to facilitate laccase immobilization using sequential method (Hou et al., 2014). The hydroxyl (OH-) group at the surface of zinc oxide was modified to alkyl amine (NH3 +). Then, the alkyl amine was subsequently modified to aldehyde functional group facilitating laccase immobilization through the binding to amino groups of the enzyme. Briefly, 8 mL of 2% APTES in acetone was added to the zinc oxide nanostructure coated on the glass slide and stirred at 90 rpm, 45 °C for 24 h. Then, the coated glass slide was placed in 8 mL of 5% GLU in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 2 h. After that, the structure was washed several times using distilled water to remove unbound GLU, and was dried at 60 °C for 30 min. The structure of modified surface was finally characterized by XRD and FTIR using the instruments previously described."
5,Laccase immobilization,"2.4 Laccase immobilization Laccase solution consisting of 1 mg/mL laccase in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 was prepared and promptly measured laccase activity before immobilization process. The functionally modified zinc oxide nanostructure on 1 cm2 glass slide, cut from 19.4 cm2 glass slide from surface modification step, was placed in the 1 mL laccase solution in 10 mL plastic tube with screw cap and the reaction was gently stirred at 90 rpm, 4 °C for 48 h to allow enzyme immobilization. Note that immobilization of laccase was characterized by SEM-EDX, FTIR spectrometer, XRD and enzyme activity assay. To determine enzyme activity, the glass slide was removed from the enzyme solution and washed with 7 mL of 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer to remove unbound enzyme. Remaining laccase activity was; then, measured in the enzyme supernatant and washing solution."
6,Laccase activity assay,"2.5 Laccase activity assay Laccase activity was tested using ABTS as a substrate. Each reaction contained 62 µL of enzyme solution and 1938 µL of 1.0 mM ABTS in acetate buffer, pH 4.5. To test laccase activity, the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 5 min and stopped the reaction using 100 µL of sulfuric acid. Oxidation of ABTS by laccase yields the production of greenish ABTS+ (Palmieri et al., 1997). The amount of ABTS+ was monitored at absorbance of 420 nm using UV–visible spectrophotometer. One unit of the enzyme (U) represented the oxidation of 1 µmol ABTS per min at 25 °C using the extinction coefficient (ℇ420 nm) of 0.036 µM/cm (Palmieri et al., 1997)."
7,Enzyme immobilization yield and efficiency,"2.6 Enzyme immobilization yield and efficiency Enzyme immobilization yield was the percentage of immobilized enzyme activity, which can be determined by subtracting the laccase activity in enzyme supernatant after immobilization (As) and in all washing solution (Aw) from the initial laccase activity in the enzyme solution before adding the functionally modified zinc oxide (Ai), to the initial laccase activity in enzyme solution as presented in Eq. (1). (1) Immobilization Yield (%)=[(Ai–(As+Aw))/Ai]x100 In contrast, enzyme immobilization efficiency was the percentage of immobilized enzyme activity (αi) in free enzyme activity (αf) as presented in Eq. (2). (2) Immobilization Efficiency (%)=(αi/αf)x100 In this study, the immobilization yield and efficiency of the method was determined based on data from 6 replicates."
8,Biodegradation test,"2.7 Biodegradation test Biodegradation of TBA catalyzed by both immobilized and suspended laccase was carried out in 25 mL test tubes (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ). The experimental design consisted of two controls and experimental sets with the different type of laccase (immobilized vs. suspended laccase). Note that laccase-free controls were prepared in condition with and without addition of zinc oxide nanostructure on the glass slide. In the experiment with suspended laccase, the enzyme was added into test tube at the same amount of laccase immobilized on glass slides (approximate 0.88 mg/10 mL solution). Biodegradation tests (n = 3 per each condition) using either suspended or immobilized laccase were performed using 100 mg/L TBA solution, prepared by diluting TBA in 10 mL 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer. The reaction tubes were placed at room temperature and normal illumination persisting in laboratory (39.79 cd) without agitation. The samples (100 µL) were collected every twelve hours between 0 and 108 h from the test tubes. The activity of the enzyme in collected samples was suspended by addition of 5 µL sulfuric acid. Samples were then stored at 4 °C prior to the analysis of TBA by gas chromatography. The kinetics of the enzyme biodegradation reaction by both free and immobilized laccase was determined in this study. To obtain the kinetics parameters, biodegradation tests using either suspended or immobilized laccase were conducted using four different TBA concentrations (approximate 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/L, and n = 3 per each experiment) in 25 mL test tubes with the reaction volume of 10 mL. Initial biodegradation rates of each experiment were calculated by averaging the slopes of TBA disappearance (in the linear region) in triplicate and were normalized to measured activity of the enzyme as shown in the Eq. (3): (3) V=(C0–Ct)/(t x U) when V represents the initial TBA biodegradation rate (mg TBA/h∙U), C0 is the initial concentration of TBA (mg/L), Ct is the concentration of TBA at the equilibrium (mg/L), t is the time point that biodegradation reaction firstly reaches the equilibrium at 36 h and U is the activity of enzyme (enzyme unit/L). A plot of the initial biodegradation rates as a function of TBA concentration was generated as described by the Michaelis-Menten equation as shown in Eq. (4) (Michaelis et al., 2011): (4) V=(VmaxS)/(km+S) where V is rate of TBA biodegradation catalyzed by laccase (mg TBA/h∙U); Vmax represents the maximum TBA biodegradation rate (mg TBA/h∙U); S is TBA concentration (mg/L); km (the Michaelis constant) is the substrate concentration (mg/L) at which the biodegradation rate of TBA is half of Vmax. To determine the kinetic parameters including km and Vmax, Lineweaver-Burk plot, a modified Michaelis-Menten equation, was generated by plotting reciprocal of V as a function of reciprocal of initial TBA concentration as shown in Eq. (5) (Lineweaver and Burk, 1934). (5) [1/V] = (km /Vmax∙S) – (1/Vmax) From the graph, the slope (a) and intercept (b) of the linear curve were calculated by the least–square method. Vmax and km were determined based on the slope and intercept values as described in Eqs. (6) and (7), respectively. (6) Vmax=1/b (7) km=a∙Vmax"
9,Enzyme repeatability,"2.8 Enzyme repeatability To evaluate the repeatability of the immobilized laccase on zinc oxide nanostructure, the degradation tests (n = 3) were performed in 25-mL test tubes (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ) with the reaction volume of 10 mL. The immobilized laccase on zinc oxide nanostructure was placed in the tube with the initial TBA concentration of 100 mg/L at room temperature without agitation. The samples (100 µL) were collected every twelve hours from the test tubes until equilibrium reached. The activity of the enzyme and TBA concentration in collected samples were analyzed. Once equilibrium reached, the leftover aqueous solution in the reaction tube was discarded and replaced with fresh 10 mL of 100 mg/L TBA. The experiments were run three times with the same immobilized laccase samples at 0, 96 and 528 h. Note that the immobilized enzyme was kept in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer between round 2 and 3 (between 192 and 528 h)."
10,Analysis of TBA,"2.9 Analysis of TBA Analysis of TBA was performed using Varian Star 3400 CX Gas Chromatography equipped with a Flame Ionization Detector, and a stainless steel-coated gas chromatography packing column (2 m length x 2.0 mm id) with 10% Carbowax 20 M on 80–100 mesh Chromosorb. TBA in aqueous samples was quantified by directly injecting 1 µL of samples previously filtered by 0.45 µm syringe filters, into the injector set at 200 °C in pulse-splitless mode. The oven was isothermally set at 80 °C for 3 min with the flow of nitrogen gas of 30 mL/min. Detector was set at 320 °C with the hydrogen and air flow of 40 and 300 mL/min, respectively. The peak of TBA occurred at a retention time of 2.05 min. TBA standards prepared by diluting pure TBA in deionized water were used to produce an external calibration curve. With this method, the accuracy and method detection limit for TBA analysis was determined as ± 5% and 7.25 mg/L, respectively."
11,Results and discussion,
12,Characterization of zinc oxide nanoarray,"3.1 Characterization of zinc oxide nanoarray Zinc oxide were successfully grown on glass slide. Based on the SEM image, zinc oxide had rod shape morphology with 40 nm width in average ( Fig. 1A). The size of zinc oxide crystal was in agreement with that reported in Vasudevan et al. (2011), who applied hydrolysis method to generate zinc oxide nanorod. The EDX mapping ( Fig. 2) also confirmed the presence of zinc oxide. It is possible that the other peaks observed in the spectrum beyond zinc and oxygen are due to the glass substrate consisting of silicon dioxide. The crystal of zinc oxide on glass slide were also characterized by X-ray Diffractometer in-plane mode. Fig. 3 demonstrates the XRD pattern of immobilized laccase on zinc oxide nanoarray, surface-modified zinc oxide nanoarray and zinc oxide nanoarray in comparison to the standard diffraction pattern for zinc oxide phase (ICSD Collection Code: 290,322). The similar XRD pattern of zinc oxide nanoarray was also reported in literatures (Vasudevan et al., 2011; Saleh et al., 2012). The diffraction patterns confirm the presence of zinc oxide as thin film on the surface of the glass slide without any structure destruction after surface modification and enzyme immobilization. XRD spectra also show the decrease of the diffraction peak after surface modification and laccase immobilization. This is possibly due to the intercalation of functional groups during successive surface modifications. Note that the diffraction peak at around 10° results from the application of APTES in surface modification."
13,Laccase immobilization on zinc oxide nanoarray,"3.2 Laccase immobilization on zinc oxide nanoarray In this study, we immobilized laccase on surface-modified zinc oxide nano-arrays. The attachment of the enzyme on zinc oxide nanostructure was demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. Fig. 1B revealed the characteristic of immobilized laccase on glass slide after immobilization process. Laccase immobilization resulted in the change of zinc oxide nanostructure in rod shape (40 nm width in average) to nanosphere (80 nm diameter in average). This might be due to the effect of chelation between Cu2+ in laccase and zinc oxide nanostructure as previously demonstrated and described earlier (Rani et al., 2017). The increase in size and change in morphology is an evidence to demonstrate the attachment of laccase on zinc oxide nanostructure. EDX mapping was also conducted to determine the elements containing in either zinc oxide nanoarray or immobilized laccase (Fig. 2). It was shown that immobilized laccase possessed a higher mass fraction of oxygen content when compared to the zinc oxide nanoarray (36.6 vs. 23.3% wt.). An increase in oxygen content in the immobilized laccase suggests the complete immobilization of the enzyme on zinc oxide nanoarray. Similar behavior was also observed for the immobilization of either Pachyrhizus erosus peroxidase onto surface modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes-buckypaper/polyvinyl alcohol composite membrane (Jun et al., 2019) or horseradish peroxidase onto iron magnetic nanocomposite (Mohamed et al., 2017). Besides the SEM image, FTIR was applied to demonstrate functional groups involved in laccase immobilization. Fig. 4 shows the FTIR spectrums obtained from zinc oxide nanoarray, surface-modified zinc oxide nanoarray, immobilized laccase on zinc oxide nanoarray located on the glass slides, and laccase. FTIR spectrum of zinc oxide reveals the characteristic band of hydroxyl functional group at 3430 cm−1 (stretching). This band involves OH groups within the bulk of zinc oxide or surface OH groups. In contrast, the vibration band with the peak at 539 cm−1 represents the stretching mode of Zn–O bond. After surface modification, the peaks at 1073 and 1696 cm−1 were observed representing Si–O–Si and C˭N stretching vibration, respectively. Si–O–Si bond indicates the successful bonding of APTES and zinc oxide, while C˭N bond results from the bonding between amine group of APTES and aldehyde group of GLU. Although the FTIR pattern of the immobilized laccase resembled that of both functionalized zinc oxide nanoarray and pure laccase, there was an increase in the peak intensity at 1635 cm−1 in the immobilized enzyme when compared to the modified zinc oxide nanoarray or pure laccase. This reflects the increase in amide bonds that join laccase and functionalized zinc oxide. These FTIR results justified that the covalent bonds were formed during construction of the immobilized laccase. The activity of immobilized enzyme was measured based on ABTS reaction. Based on six-replicate experiments, immobilization yield and immobilization efficiency of the immobilized laccase was estimated at 88.6 ± 1.19% and 91.3 ± 2.13%, respectively. While the immobilization efficiency of laccase in this study was comparable to that of Sanjay et al. (2014), which applied silicon dioxide for laccase immobilization, the immobilization yield of this study is higher (88.6% vs. 75.8%). This suggests that zinc oxide nanoparticle is an alternative support for effective laccase immobilization."
14,Biodegradation of TBA,"3.3 Biodegradation of TBA Laccase is considered a versatile enzyme capable of catalyzing biodegradation of various organic contaminants. This enzyme catalyzes redox reaction and requires organic compounds and oxygen molecules as electron donor and electron acceptor, respectively. The carbon atoms in organic compounds are converted to carbon dioxide, while oxygen in oxygen molecules are reduced to water, as a by-product of the reaction. Laccase can be obtained from various organisms including fungi, plants, insects and bacteria (Morozova et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2001; Upadhyay et al., 2016). Among these, fungal laccase from T. versicolor, a white rot fungus, possessed the highest redox potential which is attractive for biotechnological applications (Reinhammar, 1972). Hence, T. versicolor laccase has been applied for catalyzing biodegradation of various organic pollutants including aliphatic and aromatic alcohols (Fabbrini et al., 2001), azo dyes (Borchert and Libra, 2001; Legerska et al., 2018), pharmaceuticals (Tran et al., 2010), ether (Hundt et al., 1999), aliphatic thioether and endocrine disruptors (Hongyan et al., 2019; Macellaro et al., 2014). In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of suspended and immobilized laccase from T. versicolor, on degradation of 100 mg/L TBA. The results revealed that immobilized and suspended laccase could remove TBA at the removal efficiency of 55.1 ± 2.69% (from 101 ± 2.90–51.7 ± 2.08 mg TBA/L) and 49.3 ± 3.77% (from 101 ± 1.61–45.5 ± 2.01 mg TBA/L), respectively, within 108 h of experiment ( Fig. 5). In contrast, enzyme free controls with and without zinc oxide nanostructure on the glass slides could not remove TBA from water (Fig. 5). These evidences suggested that removal of TBA in aqueous solution was not due to the adsorption of TBA on zinc oxide nanostructure, but the effect of the enzyme. To our knowledge, this study is the first to reveal the capability of laccase in catalyzing degradation of TBA. It is possible that laccase enzyme could catalyze sequential abstraction of electrons from the substrates as proposed for aromatic compounds degradation (Kurniawati and Nicell, 2008). However, further investigation should be performed to understand the role of laccase on TBA degradation, the optimal condition for TBA catalysis, and degradation pathway. Interestingly, the degradation efficiency of TBA by the immobilized laccase is slightly higher than suspended laccase. This is in agreement with other studies that revealed the higher efficiency of immobilized laccase on degradation of organic compounds. It was reported that Bacillus subtilis MTCC2414 laccase immobilized by entrapping method using sodium alginate was better in catalyzing degradation of synthetic Yellow GR dye than that of suspended laccase (Narayanan et al., 2015). Similarly, covalent binding immobilization of Panus conchatus laccase on carboxylated polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was more efficient in removal of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol than suspended laccase (Yinghui et al., 2002). These suggest that enzyme immobilization could be a way to improve the efficiency of enzyme on catalyzing degradation of organic contaminants."
15,Enzyme kinetics,"3.4 Enzyme kinetics In this study, we conducted experiments to establish kinetic parameters including km and Vmax for both suspended and immobilized laccase on degradation of TBA. The biodegradation rate from biodegradation experiments using different initial TBA concentrations and type of laccase (suspended vs immobilized laccase) were obtained and used for modeling. It was shown that the data sets from experiments using free and immobilized laccase were well fitted to the Michaelis-Menten Model ( Fig. 6). km and Vmax values presented in Table 1 were calculated from the slope and intercept of the Lineweaver-Burk Plot ( Fig. 7). From the calculation, the apparent km value of immobilized T. versicolor laccase was about 2.03 times higher than free laccase (at the same amount of the enzyme) on TBA substrate. This implies that immobilized laccase has lower affinity towards TBA. It is possible that the increase in km value may result from various possible factors such as the loss of enzyme flexibility that possibly affects substrate binding and the steric hindrance of enzyme active site. Although the immobilization of laccase lowered affinity between TBA and laccase, Vmax of the immobilized laccase was about 1.53 times higher than suspended laccase. It is possible that the turnover of laccase was limited by high affinity of substrates and/or products. Decrease in affinity between substrate and enzyme or product due to enzyme immobilization may make the enzyme available for subsequent reaction cycles. Thus, increasing exchange rates might concomitantly increase both km and Vmax. Note that the increase of both km and Vmax of immobilized laccase was also observed in other studies (Songulashvili et al., 2012; Bagewadi et al., 2017). Table 2 compares the specific biodegradation rate of TBA biodegradation catalyzed by various enzymes. It was shown that both suspended and immobilized laccase from T. versicolor had the highest specific biodegradation rate compared to other enzymes produced by individual bacterial strains or mixed bacterial consortia. This is in agreement with the fact that fungi have a higher degrading effectiveness than bacteria (Muhonja et al., 2018)."
16,Repeatability of immobilized laccase,"3.5 Repeatability of immobilized laccase The repeatability of enzyme is essential for cost-effective use in environmental and industrial application (Tran and Balkus, 2011). The repeatability of the enzyme was; hence, evaluated in this study. Results from repeatability test using the immobilized laccase was shown in Fig. 8. While no change in TBA concentration was observed in enzyme-free control, the immobilized laccase was capable of degrading TBA for all three cycles (Fig. 8). The degradation of TBA catalyzed by the immobilized laccase slightly decreased from 44.4 ± 2.61% for the cycle 1 to 39.6 ± 6.76% for the cycle 3. These results suggested that immobilization of laccase could allow a repetitive use of the enzyme for biodegradation of TBA. Interestingly, the storage of immobilized enzyme in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer between round 2 and 3 for 336 h had a small effect on the degradation efficiency (44.1 ± 18.6% for cycle 2 vs 39.6 ± 6.76% for cycle 3). Hence, the immobilized laccase could be stored in 0.1 M phosphate buffer for future uses with minimal effect on enzyme catalytic capability."
17,Scalability and future research direction,"3.6 Scalability and future research direction Scalability of the process can be performed by immobilizing the enzyme on glass bead or other similar materials and placing them in a reaction tank. This might be an alternative reactor that can be used in conjunction with pump-and-treat system for ex-situ treatment of organic compounds in subsurface water. Alternatively, it is possible to build a long vertical water conduit containing many layers of glass with immobilized laccase. Passing the contaminated water through the conduit with up-flow direction might be alternative approach to treat organic compounds in contaminated water. Although the immobilized laccase could be used for treatment of TBA in water, the operational parameters including pH, temperature, enzyme loading and initial contaminant concentration, etc., may affect the performance and repeatability of the immobilized enzyme in real world applications. To understand the effects of these parameters on the immobilized laccase, further investigations or assessments must be performed."
18,Conclusion,"The present study described the method used for laccase immobilization on zinc oxide nanostructure. The attachment of the immobilized enzyme was confirmed by SEM image, and the immobilization yield and efficiency were determined as about 89% and 91%, respectively. Biodegradation of TBA catalyzed by both suspended and immobilized laccase was observed. To our knowledge, this study is the first to reveal the ability of laccase on catalyzing biodegradation of TBA. Based on kinetic data, both Vmax and km determined for immobilized enzyme were higher than those of suspended enzyme for biodegradation of TBA. The higher in maximum velocity of reaction probably resulted from the change in affinity between enzyme and substrate. Additionally, the immobilized laccase could be reused for biodegradation with minimal effect on removal efficiency. Enzyme immobilization on zinc oxide nanostructure is; thus, a promising and economical strategy to conserve catalytic enzyme for treatment of TBA."
