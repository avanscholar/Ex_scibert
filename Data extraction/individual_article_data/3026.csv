0,Introduction,"With the crises of energy and environment, Hydrogen, an efficient and clean energy source, has been widely regarded as an ideal substitute for fossil energy for which it provides high combustion heat and leaves no contaminant. Since TiO2 was first used for water-splitting by Honda and Fujishima in 1972, the photocatalytic conversion of solar energy into hydrogen energy to achieve the cycle of water-hydrogen-water has become a great potential strategy to solve the increasingly serious energy and environmental crises [1]. Although visible light occupies nearly half of the sunlight, very few visible-light-responded semiconductors, different from ultraviolet photocatalysts (TiO2, SrTiO3, NiTa2O7, etc), can split water into hydrogen and oxygen in a “H2O” ratio [2–6]. Most visible-light-driven photocatalysts can only be excited to produce H2 or O2. Fortunately, originating from natural photosynthesis, the construction of Z-scheme system skillfully exploited the H2-evolving and O2-evolving photocatalysts to parry the above unwelcome shortcoming and was successfully applied in overall water splitting under visible light irradiation. The Z-scheme system is made up primarily of two different semiconductors for generating H2 and O2 and an electron mediator for conducting electrons. And the conventional electron mediator is often an electron acceptor/donor pair such as Fe3+/Fe2+, IO3 −/I2, [Co(bpy)3]3+/[Co(bpy)3]2+, etc. However, some obvious limitation from these pairs were also found in the practical application. For instance, they can absorb strongly the desired visible light by the pholocatalysts, only in a specified pH working condition [7–11]. Moreover, the environmental pollutant can not also exist in the solution of this system since the contaminants can disturb the circulation between the electron acceptor pair and donor pair. Recently, more and more solid conducting media, such as noble metals and carbon materials, have been used to substitute for the electron acceptor/donor pair to construct the all-solid-state Z-Scheme photocatalytic systems. These all-solid-state systems not only break the restrictions of the traditional redox pair, but also possess a high electron conduction capability. The common electron conducting media such as Au, Ag, Pt are often noble metal and their high cost are not conducive to the application of Z-scheme systems [12–14]. But nowadays, graphene as a new category of carbonaceous material has been one of the most watched electron-conducting materials due to its superior electrical, optical and chemical properties. Compared to noble metals, graphite as the raw material of graphene is far more abundant reserves on the earth [15–20]. Thus, graphene was used to construct the all-solid-state Z-scheme system and showed a great potential in electron conduction between the two semiconductors [21–23]. The metal sulfide semiconductors (CdS, CuGaS2, ZnIn2S4) were always employed as an H2-evolving or O2-evolving photocatalyst in these all-solid-state systems due to their appropriate conduction band and valence band potential [12,13,21–28]. Although these sulfide semiconductors exhibited the good photocatalytic performance, their own metal ions (Cd2+, Ga3+, In3+) are known to be toxic strongly, limiting the wide application of these photocatalysts. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on the all-solid-state Z-schemes without using the toxic metal semiconductors in water splitting until now, although they were desired strongly. In this work, a Z-scheme photocatalytic system of RGO-Cu2O/Fe2O3 was constructed for the first time by one-step solvothermal synthesis, as shown in Scheme 1 . RGO was used as a charge transfer medium between Cu2O and Fe2O3. The RGO-Cu2O/Fe2O3 composites were capable of producing hydrogen under visible-light irradiation in the absence of noble metal plating or sacrificial agents. The effect of the relative amount of Cu2O, Fe2O3 and graphene on the photocatalytic activity of the RGO-Cu2O/Fe2O3 photocatalysts is systematically investigated. Moreover, the TC was tried to introduce into the hydrogen production system, which could be seen as a sacrificial agent. And the hydrogen production and TC degradation was simultaneously achieved in one system. In addition, diverse organic compounds used as sacrificial agents are also investigated in this system."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of graphite oxide,"2.1 Synthesis of graphite oxide Graphite oxide (GO) was synthesized via a modified Hummer's method. In the first place, Flake graphite (3 g), P2O5 (2.5 g) and K2S2O8 (2.5 g) were added into 12 mL 98% H2SO4. The mixture was stirred at 353 K for 2 h. Then, the treated mixture was diluted with 500 mL of distilled water and filtered under vacuum. During filtration, the other 500 mL distilled water was added slowly to the above mixture to remove the residual acid. Finally, the obtained product was dried at 323 K overnight. The pre-oxidized graphite solid was put into 120 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid and stirred under ice-cooling conditions. After addition of KMnO4 (15 g), the solution changed to dark green. Then, the dark green solution was stirred at 308 K for 2 h in the ice-water bath. After that, 250 mL of water and 20 mL of 30% H2O2 was slowly added into the suspended mixture one after another. The obtained yellow solution was filtered and washed with 330 mL of dilute hydrochloric acid solution (10 wt%) several times to remove the metal ions. Finally, the product was dried at 333 K in vacuum for 1 day."
3,Synthesis of RGO-Cu2O/Fe2O3 photocatalysts,"2.2 Synthesis of RGO-Cu2O/Fe2O3 photocatalysts 50 mg of GO was dispersed in 20 mL of ethanol under sonication for 1 h. Then, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.4728 g) and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (0.3036 g) were put into the above solution and constantly stirred until the solid was dissolved. After the pH of the mixture was slowly adjusted to 10 with 6 M NaOH solution, a stable brown viscous homogeneous solution was formed. The suspended mixture was moved into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 453 K for 24 h. The precipitate was centrifuged and washed with distilled water and ethanol several times, and dried at 333 K with a vacuum oven for 12 h. The product was marked as G50-7/3, because of m(Cu2O):m(Fe2O3) is 7:3. For comparison, the same method was used to synthesize different complexes of the RGO-Cu2O/Fe2O3 photocatalyst."
4,Material characterizations,"2.3 Material characterizations The crystal structures of the as-prepared samples were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å), (D/MAX-2500 diffractometer, Rigaku, Japan). The scan rate of 7°min−1 was set. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was used to investigate the sample using transmission electron microscopy (Tenai G2 F30 S-Twin, FEI). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted using a Thermo ESCALAB 250X (America) electron spectrometer using 150 W Al Kα X-ray sources. The UV–vis diffused reflectance spectra (DRS) of the samples were measured on an UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-2450, Shimadzu, Japan). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of samples were measured on a Perkin-Elmer LS 55 at room temperature using a fluorescence spectrophotometer."
5,Photocatalytic H2 production,"2.4 Photocatalytic H2 production The photocatalytic water splitting experiments were implemented in a Lab-H2 photocatalytic H2 production system. A 300 W Xenon arc lamp equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter was chosen as a visible light source and was placed above 20 cm away from the reactor in system. In this paper, 50 mg catalyst was dispersed into 140 mL of distilled water with sonication for 30 s. And then, 60 mL of a 100 mg/L TC aqueous solution was added and the solution was stirred in the dark for 30 min. The oxygen dissolved in the aqueous solution was removed by pumping vacuum before irradiation. The above solution was constantly stirred to keep the uniformity of the catalyst suspension under visible light irradiation. The quantitative gas was collected after 6 h of the reaction and was analyzed to get the specific content of hydrogen by gas chromatograph (GC-14C, Shimadzu, Japan, TCD, Nitrogen as a carrier gas). In order to ensure the accuracy of the experiment, the reaction vessel and accessories were rigorously cleaned and carefully rinsed with distilled water before the experiment."
6,Photocatalytic degradation of TC,"2.5 Photocatalytic degradation of TC TC, a colorless small molecular contaminants, was chosen to assess the activity of the photocatalysts under visible light irradiation. 50 mg of photocatalyst powder was put into 100 mL of a 40 mg/L TC aqueous solution. Prior to the photocatalytic reaction, the suspension was stirred in the dark for 30 min to achieve a adsorption/desorption equilibrium. A cut-off filter was placed around a 300 W xenon arc lamp to ensure the solution irradiated with visible light. At given time intervals, 5 mL of the suspension was sampled, centrifuged and filtered to remove the photocatalyst. The concentration of the remaining TC was analyzed in sequence by its absorbance (A) at 357 nm using a UV–vis spectro-photometer. C/C0 was defined as the degradation rate, where C was the TC concentration after illumination and C0 was the initial TC concentration when adsorption and desorption balanced."
7,Results and discussion,"The Morphology of RGO-Cu2O/Fe2O3 photocatalysts is characterized by TEM, as shown in Fig. 1 a. The low-magnification TEM image shows the nanosized Cu2O and Fe2O3 have a nonuniform and dense dispersion on the surface of RGO sheet showing that the RGO sheet and Cu2O or Fe2O3 have a strong interfacial contact for G50-7/3 prepared by an in situ chemistry approach. To further obtain the microscopic morphology and structure information of the sample, the high-magnification TEM image (Fig. 1b) is observed and shows that on the RGO surface grows the disorder spherical Cu2O and foliate Fe2O3, with the average crystallite size of 100 nm. In addition, the HRTEM images clearly exhibit the crystalline-structural details of Cu2O and Fe2O3 nanoparticles. Fig. 1c shows the HRTEM image of Cu2O nanoparticles, verifying its highly crystallized structure, where one set of lattice planes can be clearly observed at 0.210 nm, corresponding to the (200) plane of the Cu2O phase [29–31]. Similarly, Fig. 1d shows the HRTEM image of Fe2O3 nanoparticles, proving its highly crystallized structure, where one group of lattice planes can be clearly observed at 0.362 nm, which corresponds to the (012) plane of the Fe2O3 phase [32–34]. The combination of TEM images and HRTEM image proved that Cu2O and Fe2O3 nanoparticles were successfully loaded on the RGO surface. Fig. S1 shows the STEM image and the elemental distribution of the RGO-Cu2O/Fe2O3 composites, demonstrating that the Cu2O and Fe2O3 nanoparticles are well separated on the RGO sheets. The combination of TEM, HRTEM and STEM characterizations confirm that Cu2O and Fe2O3 nanoparticles have been successfully loaded on the surface of RGO and are spatially well separated. In the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of RGO-Cu2O (G50-10/0), RGO-Fe2O3 (G50-0/10) and RGO-Cu2O/Fe2O3 (Fig. S2), the diffraction peaks of composites can well correspond to cubic phase Cu2O (JCPD Card No. 75-1531) and Fe2O3 (JCPDS Card No. 87-1165). Compare with Cu2O and Fe2O3, the XRD pattern obtained by reduction of graphene oxide (GO) cannot be distinguished, due to its low quantity and poor crystallinity. Among various photocatalytic systems containing graphene, successful reduction of GO to RGO plays a key role in the photocatalytic activity. The RGO-Cu2O/Fe2O3 samples were characterized through Raman spectroscopy to confirm the reduction of GO under the ethanol-thermal condition. The Raman spectra of different samples in Fig. 2 a contain two distinct peaks at ∼1580 cm−1 and ∼1350 cm−1, which can be assigned to the D and G bands from the vibrations of sp3 and sp2 carbon atoms in a graphitic 2D planar structure, respectively. The intensity ratio of ID/IG is calculated to estimate the reduction degree of GO. Compared with the ID/IG of GO (0.93), the increased ID/IG of G50-10/0 (1.04), G50-7/3 (0.989) and G50-0/10 (1.06) indicates the decrease of sp3 carbons and subsequently the successful reduction of GO to RGO under the ethanol-thermal condition. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was also utilized to investigate the valence of Cu, Fe and C in the RGO-Cu2O/Fe2O3 composite. The two peaks located at 711.6 and 724.6 eV (Fig. 2b), are typical for Fe (III) demonstrating that Fe (III) is not reduced during the ethanol-thermal process, still in the form of Fe2O3 [32,34]. Meanwhile, the typical XPS peaks of Cu (2p) at 932.7 and 952.6 eV (Fig. 2c) indicate that Cu2O exists in the RGO-Cu2O/Fe2O3 composites [29,30]. There are several peaks of C1s located at 284.8, 286.3 and 288.3 eV (Fig. 2d), corresponding to CC, CO, CO, respectively. Compared with XPS charts of GO in Fig. S3, the weak peaks of CO and CO in RGO-Cu2O/Fe2O3 give a circumstantial evidence for the reduction of GO. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the G50-10/0, G50-0/10 and RGO-Cu2O/Fe2O3 nanocomposites are shown in Fig. S4. Pure Cu2O nanoparticles has an absorption edge at 610 nm corresponding to the band gap of 2.0 eV (Fig. S3c and Fig. S4c) [29]. Pure Fe2O3 nanoparticles possess an absorption edge at 645 nm corresponding to its band gap of 1.9 eV (Fig. S4b and Fig. S4d) [33]. The introduction of RGO leads to the red shift of absorption edges and the enhancement of visible light absorption, owning to the interaction of RGO with Cu2O and Fe2O3, which plays an important role in the enhancement of the photocatalytic performance. The band positions of the photocatalyst can also be estimated with the band gap energies, as shown in Fig. S4e. The ECB of Cu2O and Fe2O3 are −0.2 and 0.5 eV, and the EVB of Cu2O and Fe2O3 are estimated to be 1.8 and 2.4 eV respectively. The results are in agreement with the reported papers [35–40]. Photocatalytic hydrogen production without any scavenger on various samples was evaluated under visible-light illumination. The influence of the Cu2O/Fe2O3 ratio on the photocatalytic H2 production rate was investigated with fixed RGO amount (20%). The denoted Cu2O/Fe2O3 ratio was calculated from the starting mass ratio, and the actual mass ratio was also measured by ICP-MS (Table S1 in the Supporting Information). The denoted Cu2O/Fe2O3 ratio was close to the actual one. The G50-10/0 showed a photocatalytic hydrogen production of 0.38 × 10−6 mol/h/g and a dramatic increase in the H2 production up to 0.60 × 10−6 mol/h/g was achieved with the Cu2O/Fe2O3 ratio of 7:3, which was about 1.5 times higher than that of RGO-Cu2O (Fig. 3 a). After that, continuous decrease of H2 production rate was observed with further decrease of the Cu2O/Fe2O3 ratio. Then the other group using TC as a scavenger was also conducted. It can also be seen in Fig. 3a that the changing trend of test data between two groups is accordant, and the H2 production rate with TC are much larger than that without TC. The maximum H2 production with TC reached to 4.86 × 10−6 mol/h/g and has been raised seven times compared to the one in pure water in the case of G50-7/3. The photocatalytic H2 production was largely improved by the addition of TC. The consumption of TC was also investigated in Fig. 3b, which indicated that TC was indeed consumed during H2 production. These results proved that the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes has been enhanced by the combination of RGO, Cu2O and Fe2O3 and showed that TC had a great potential as the scavenger in photocatalytic H2 production. The effect of different TC amounts was investigated in Fig. S5. It is clear that the hydrogen production increases first and then decreases with the increasing of TC concentration. The increasing of TC concentration increases the hydrogen production, but excess TC increases the pH of the solution, changing the reduction potential of hydrogen against H2 production. Moreover, the recycling experiment was also added in Fig.S6 and the result showed that RGO-Cu2O/Fe2O3 had a certain stability for photocatalytic performance. In order to clarify the effect of the combination of Cu2O, RGO and Bi2O3 on the charge separation further, Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was also investigated. Fig. S7 shows the PL spectra of the Cu2O, RGO-Cu2O and RGO-Cu2O/Fe2O3 samples, which all show the broad emission peaks centered at 720 nm, while RGO-Cu2O/Fe2O3 composite samples exhibit lower emission intensity than pure Cu2O. PL emission results from the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pair, and the intensity is proportional to the recombination rate. Therefore, the low PL intensity in the RGO-Cu2O/Fe2O3 composites indicates that the recombination of electron-hole pairs has been depressed. The lowest PL intensity is observed in G50-8/2, which possesses the highest separation ratio of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The result further proves that the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes has been enhanced by the combination of RGO, Cu2O and Fe2O3. However, due to the vacuum condition for hydrogen production system, the sample of the best hydrogen production does not correspond to G50-8/2. Thus, the photodegradation of TC was conducted under normal condition and the effect of GO content was also investigated. The best photocatalytic activity (84.24%) and the optimum content of RGO agent (50 mg) was achieved by G50-8/2, in good agreement with charge recombination rate estimated from the PL intensity. (Fig. S8 in the Supporting Information). The H2 production rate of the G50-7/3 composite using different scavengers was also studied. In Fig. 3c, the addition of methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) had little effect on the H2 production compared to the one without any scavenger, and the degradation of MB and MO were only 3.2% and 0.32%, indicating these two dyes are not good hole scavenger in our RGO-Cu2O/Fe2O3 system. TC showed the highest H2 production rate among various scavengers, which was even about five times higher than the one using methanol. Among those adopted organic compounds, there were more oxygen-containing groups (OH, CO) in TC, which can form coordination bonds (CuO, FeO) with Cu2O and Fe2O3, increasing the adsorption of TC on the catalyst (Table S2 in the Supporting Information). And it also can be seen that TC possesses more reductive groups than MB and MO, which enables itself to consume holes better. For these reasons, TC has shown the excellent consumption capability for hole as a sacrificial agent, which rendered it a good application potential in this photocatalytic H2 production. To clarify the photocatalytic reaction mechanism in this system, a control group of experiments were carried out with different samples, which showed diverse activities for water splitting. Compared with the highest H2 production with the G50-7/3 composite in Fig. 3d, there was only trace hydrogen detected from Cu2O/Fe2O3 composite, suggesting that RGO played an important role in the transportation of photogenerated carriers. Moreover, it is known that the photocatalytic performance depends on the position of the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB), which generates the e− and h+ that play important roles in hydrogen production. In theory, compared with the CB edge potential of Cu2O and Fe2O3, only the CB edge potential of Cu2O (−0.2 eV vs. NHE) is more negative than the standard redox potential of H+/H2 (E0(H+/H2) = 0 eV) (Fig. S4e), which has met the basic requirements of hydrogen production. According to those data, a Z-scheme route was the most plausible explanation for the reaction system. To further clarify the mechanism, the comparative test was conducted in the reaction system of hydrogen production over G50-8/2 sample using TC as the scavenger without evacuation. Fig. 4 a showed the removal ratio of TC increases from 20% to 75% with the condition changing from an anaerobic vacuum environment to an aerobic vacuum environment. It was suggested that electrons were indeed generated and used to hydrogen production during the photocatalytic reaction in the absence of oxygen and the electrons were converted into O2 − to the degradation of TC under aerobic condition. And the greatly enhanced degradation also revealed that O2 − plays a significant role in photocatalytic process, which indirectly validated the investigation on degradation mechanism in Fig. 4b. Moreover, Fig. 4b also showed the OH made a greater contribution to degradation than h+. For the comparison of valence bands (Fig. S4e), only the VB edge potential of Fe2O3 satisfies the demand for generation of OH, which is in good agreement with the experimental results [11]. In summary, combining comparative test and degradation mechanism experiment further demonstrated the electron transport in the reaction system followed a Z-scheme route. In addition, based on results of the capture test and comparisons displayed in Fig. 3a and b, a competitive mechanism of electrons and holes was proposed. It can been seen that RGO-Cu2O not only generated H2 but also degraded TC in hydrogen production system, which indicates that the h+ of Cu2O in G50-7/3 was consumed by e− from Fe2O3 as well as TC and meant that Fe2O3 was not the only hole contributor in TC degradation. With the decrease of the Cu2O/Fe2O3 ratio, Cu2O was replaced by Fe2O3 as the amount of Fe2O3 increased and the h+ of Cu2O was increasingly consumed by e− from Fe2O3 and the degradation of TC was gradually reduced. Thus, the degradation of TC depends on the cooperation between Cu2O and Fe2O3. This also explains why the ratio corresponding to the highest hydrogen production (Cu2O/Fe2O3 = 7/3) was inconsistent with that of the highest TC degradation (Cu2O/Fe2O3 = 8/2). The degradation of TC during hydrogen production and its intermediate products were analyzed by HPLC–MS and the mass spectra of different time period are displayed in Fig. S9. It can be seen in Fig. S9 that the original m/z value of TC is 445, which is consistent with the molecular mass of TC. Owning to the existence of OH, TC was broken down into two parts first, of which m/z values were 275 and 161. Next, as the methyl, alcohol hydroxyl and carbon bond skeletons of the two parts were digested one by one, their m/z values of 275 and 161 were reduced to 122 and 132, respectively. Then the rest of the above two parts continued to be degraded into small inorganic compounds such as CO2, NH4 + and H2O. At the final stage of the reaction, the mass spectrum peak at m/z = 445 still existed, suggesting that the consumption of TC in the process of hydrogen production depended mainly on OH and h+. The detailed degradation process of TC and its intermediate products was displayed in Fig. 5 [41–47]. Based on the above results, a Z-scheme mechanism was proposed for the complete reaction system as illustrated in Scheme 2 . Under visible-light irradiation, electrons are excited from the VB to the CB in both Cu2O and Fe2O3. RGO was used as a solid-state medium to transport excited electrons efficiently from the CB of Fe2O3 to the VB of Cu2O, inhibiting the recombination of the electrons and holes within Cu2O or Fe2O3. H2O was reduced to H2 by the electrons accumulated on the conduction band of Cu2O, while TC was oxidized into small molecules by photo-generated holes accumulated at the VB of Cu2O and OH generated by the VB of Fe2O3. Here, the holes in Cu2O are consumed by two competing routes, combining with e− from Fe2O3 and reacting with TC, and a maximum H2 production rate were achieved by compromise of the two pathways."
8,Conclusion,"In conclusion, a series of RGO-Cu2O/Fe2O3 composites have been successfully synthesized by a one-step solvothermal method. The TC degradation was first introduced into hydrogen production to consume the useless holes in a clever way and exhibited an excellent boost capability as a sacrificial agent. The H2 production using TC over the G50-7/3 composite is about eight times higher than that in pure water and five times higher than that using methanol. RGO plays a significant role in the construction of a Z-scheme photocatalytic system and the introduction of TC degradation, which undertakes the transportation of electrons from the CB of Fe2O3 to the VB of Cu2O and makes up for the defect of the redox pair in degradation. It has positive significant for the treatment of medical and industrial wastewaters to apply them as useful sacrificial agents to photocatalytic water splitting."
