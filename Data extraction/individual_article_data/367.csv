0,Introduction,"Pentanediols, including 1,2-pentanediol (1,2-PDO) and 1,5-pentanediol (1,5-PDO), are highly valued chemical feedstock, which can be used to produce cosmetics, polyesters, thermoplastic polyurethanes, plasticizers and printing inks [1–3]. Pentanediols can be produced from furfural, a product that can be obtained in bulk volume from the hemicellulose in lignocellulosic biomass by hydrolysis followed by dehydration reactions [4–6]. Specifically, the hydrogenation of the carbonyl functionality of furfural produces furfuryl alcohol (FA). The further hydrogenation of the furan ring in FA produces tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), and the subsequent hydrogenolysis of which produces 1,5-PDO [7], as is shown in Scheme 1 . The noble-metals, such as Pt-based, Rh-based and Ir-based catalysts modified with Re, Mo or W, etc. are active for this reaction route [8–14], but they are costly. Other routes for the conversion of THFA to 1,5-PDO involve the dehydration of THFA to form dihydropyran in aqueous phase, and then the subsequent hydration to form 2-hydroxytetrahydropyran and its isomeride that can be further hydrogenated to produces 1,5-PDO [15]. This reaction route involves multiple steps, and the side reactions could take place in the varied steps, negatively affecting the selectivity. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop a simplified one-pot process to produce the diols directly from furfural. The existing results have demonstrated that the non-noble metal-based catalysts, such as Cu or Ni catalysts, show activity for the conversion of furfural to diols [16–18]. For example, Cu-based catalysts can catalyze the selective hydrogenation of furfural to FA and minimize the occurrence of the further hydrogenation of the furan ring in FA to THFA [19]. The subsequent hydrogenolysis of FA via the opening of the furan ring can then produce diols [17]. However, the Cu-based catalyst shows low thermal stability [19], and the sintering of Cu species in hydrothemal conditions restricted the application of the Cu-based catalyst for conversion of furfural to diols [20]. In comparison, both Co and Ni-based catalysts show higher stability than Cu-based catalyst. Nevertheless, both Co and Ni-based catalysts are generally very active in hydrogenation of the furan ring in furfural, producing THFA that is difficult to undergo hydrogenolysis to form diols [18,21]. This leads to the low yields of 1,5-PDO over Co or Ni-based catalyst. The solution of this is to suppress the deep hydrogenation of the furan ring in FA and thus creates more changes for the conversion of FA to the diols. Unfortunately, the transition metals like nickel are intrinsically active for hydrogenation of CC bonds in alkenes. To lower the activity, the electronic properties of nickel species have to be modified. It has been well documented that the formation of alloys with a second metal could change the electronic properties of the nickel [22,23]. This might modify the hydrogenation activity of nickel for the CC bonds in the furan ring of FA. The retainment of FA in the reaction medium would enhance the chance for its further conversion to pentanediols. In this study, Fe was introduced to alloy nickel as it is known that the Ni–Fe alloy could form via reduction of the mixture of their oxides together [24,25]. Mg–Al layer double hydroxides (LDH) were used as the precursors of support of the catalyst, due to the generation of abundant mesopores from the calcination of the LDH precursor [19], for achieving the high dispersion of the metal species. The catalysts were evaluated in the conversion of furfural in ethanol and pressurized hydrogen atmosphere to produce 1,5-pentanediol (1,5-PDO) and 1,2-pentanediol (1,2-PDO). The effect of Fe on the distribution of basic sites of NiFe-based catalysts and the roles of Ni–Fe alloy were also investigated. The results show that the formation of Ni–Fe alloy can facilitate the reduction of metallic sites and improve the formation of hydrogenation sites. The bimetallic Ni–Fe catalysts thus can maintain a superior catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of furfural or FA to form diols, which cannot be achieved over monometallic Ni-based catalyst. The synergy between Ni species and Ni–Fe alloy is responsible for the superior activity for the production of diols from furfural and FA."
1,Material and methods,
2,Feedstock materials,"2.1 Feedstock materials Ni(NO3)2⋅6H2O, Mg(NO3)2⋅6H2O, NaOH, ethanol and Na2CO3 were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. THFA and Al(NO3)3⋅9H2O were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Fe(NO3)3⋅9H2O, furfural, FA, 1,5-PDO, 1,2-PDO, and 1-PO and were obtained from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. All reagents were analytical grade and were used directly without further pretreatment."
3,Catalyst synthesis,"2.2 Catalyst synthesis A series of NiFe-based catalysts were synthesized via a co-precipitation method. The catalysts with different molar ratio of Ni, Fe, Mg and Al were prepared for obtaining the catalyst with both Ni species and Ni–Fe alloy using Mg–Al LDH as the precursor. Generally, the total concentration of Ni(NO3)2, Fe(NO3)3 and Mg(NO3)2 in the solution was 0.75 mol/L, and the concentration of Al(NO3)3 in the solution was 0.25 mol/L. The solution of the nitrates and the NaOH solution (4.0 mol/L) were simultaneously added into Na2CO3 solution (0.125 mol/L) drop by drop, and the pH value was maintained at 10 ± 0.5 at 40 °C. The mixture was then further stirred, and the temperature was increased to 65 °C for crystallization for 0.5 h. After that, the mixture was aged at 65 °C for 24 h, and then the mixture was filtered and washed using deionized water until the pH of the filtrate was neutral. The precipitate collected was further dried at 80 °C for 12 h, and the LDH precursor was obtained. The prepared NiFeMgAl catalysts were defined as NixFeyMgAl, where x and y represent the molar ratio of Ni and Fe. In addition, Ni2·0MgAl (Ni2+: 0.5 mol/L, Mg2+: 0.25 mol/L and Al3+: 0.25 mol/L), Fe2·0MgAl (Fe3+: 0.5 mol/L, Mg2+: 0.25 mol/L and Al3+: 0.25 mol/L), MgAl (Mg2+: 0.75 mol/L and Al3+: 0.25 mol/L) and other catalysts (Ni1·6Fe0.4, Ni1·6Fe0·4Mg and Ni1·6Fe0·4Al) were also prepared using the same co-precipitation method for comparison. Before the catalytic experiment, the prepared precursor was firstly calcined at 600 °C for 4 h in a muffle furnace in static air, and then the sample was further reduced at 600 °C for 2 h to obtain the metallic species under a mixed H2/N2 flow (H2: 60 mL/min; N2: 60 mL/min)."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test The catalysts were evaluated for the hydrogenation of furfural in an autoclave reactor with a volume of 10 mL. Generally, solvent and reactant were mixed, and then the mixture and catalysts were loaded to the reactor vessel at room temperature. The reactor was purged initially with H2 for three times, and then further charged with H2 to specific pressure. The reactor was heated to the reaction temperature within ca. 30 min, and a stirring rate of 600 rpm was used. The reactor was maintained at the required temperature for a specified reaction time. After that, the liquid products were collected for the further characterization. The spent catalyst was collected and washed with ethanol, and then dried at 40 °C in a vacuum drying oven for 10 h for the reusability experiment or the further characterization."
5,Catalysts characterizations,"2.4 Catalysts characterizations To investigate the crystallinity of the NiFe-based catalysts, X-ray diffraction spectrometer (XRD, Rigaku Ultima IⅤ) equipped with a Cu target (K α-radiation source, λ = 1.5406 Å) was used, and the scanning rate was 20°/min. The scanning rate was 20°/min and the scanning range was 5 to 80°. The crystalline size was calculated by using the Debye-Scherrer equation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM 2100 plus instrument) was employed to investigate the micro-morphologies of the catalysts. Typically, the samples were firstly dispersed in ethanol to form supernatant, which was further added dropwisely on a copper mesh for the analysis. To probe the textural properties of the catalysts, the calcined NiFe-based catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption analysis at 77 K with the instrument of Biaode SSA–6000 using the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) method. The catalysts were degassed at 120 °C for 120 min to remove the physically adsorbed moisture before the analysis. The alkalinity properties of the catalysts were measured by temperature programmed desorption (Biaode PCA-1200 instrument) using CO2 as the probing molecule (CO2−TPD). Typically, 100 mg of catalysts was degassed at 150 °C for 30 min in a flow of helium (30 mL/min), and then the catalyst was cooled to 50 °C, and a flow of CO2 (40 mL/min) was introduced for 1 h for the adsorption. Before the ramping, helium was purged for 1 h to remove the physically adsorbed CO2 on/in the sample. After that, the sample was heated from 50 to 800 °C under a constant helium flow (30 mL/min) using a ramping rate of 20 °C/min. The signal of desorbed CO2 was recorded by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The H2-uptake of the catalyst was measured by temperature programmed desorption (Vodo VDSorb 91x instrument) using H2 as the probing molecule (H2−TPD). Typically, 100 mg of catalysts was degassed at 150 °C for 30 min in a flow of Ar (30 mL/min), and then the catalyst was cooled to 50 °C, and a flow of 10% H2/Ar (40 mL/min) was introduced for 1 h for the adsorption. Before the ramping, Ar flow was purged for 1 h to remove the physically adsorbed H2 on/in the sample. After that, the sample was heated from 50 to 800 °C under a constant Ar flow (30 mL/min) using a ramping rate of 20 °C/min. The signal of desorbed H2 was recorded by a TCD. To measure the reduction behaviors of the calcined samples, the temperature programmed reduction in hydrogen (H2-TPR) was carried out using a Vodo VDSorb 91x instrument. Generally, 10 mg of the sample was used, and a 5% H2/Ar mixed gas with a flow rate of 10 smL/min was employed as the carrier gas. The samples were heated from room temperature to 700 °C with a ramping rate of 20 °C/min, and the signal was recorded by using a TCD. In-situ Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was used to investigate the reaction process of the hydrogenation of FA over the catalysts. The characterization was performed on a Nicolet iS50 spectrometer equipped with a modified Harrick Praying Mantis DRIFT cell. The reduced catalysts were placed in the DRIFT cell, and then FA was added dropwisely on the surface of the catalyst. After that, the catalysts were heated from room temperature to 200 °C at a ramping rate of 10 °C/min and maintained at this temperature for 20 min in a constant hydrogen flow (50 mL/min). The spectra were recorded simultaneously by the detector. The LDH precursor of the catalyst was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TG) with the HCT-1 microcomputer differential thermal balance (from Beijing hengyuan experimental equipment Co., Ltd.). Typically, 10 mg of the catalyst was loaded into a ceramic crucible, and then it was heated from room temperature to 105 °C in air atmosphere and maintained at this temperature for 20 min to remove the physically adsorbed moisture. After that, the sample was further heated to 900 °C at a ramping rate of 20 °C/min in an air flow (50 mL/min). To determine the reactant conversion and yield of the liquid products, a gas chromatography coupling with a mass spectrometer (GC–MS, Shimadzu GC−MS−QP 2020 instrument) equipped with a Wax pillar column (30 m of length, 0.25 mm of internal diameter, 0.25 μm of film thickness) was used. Typically, the liquid products were diluted to ca. 2 wt% using acetone as the solvent before the analysis, and the mixture of 0.5 μL was injected into the injection port. The column temperature was firstly maintained at 40 °C for 3 min and then further heated to 250 °C and maintained at 250 °C for 5 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas, and the ramping rate was 20 °C/min. The targeting products were analyzed and identified with the standard spectra of the National Institute of Standards and Technology library (NIST 2014), and an external method was used to calculate the concentration of the targeting products. The conversion of reactant is calculated using the following equation: (1) C o n v e r s i o n ( % ) = M o l e o f reactant c o n v e r t e d M o l e o f r e a c t a n t l o a d e d × 100 % The yield of liquid products is determined by the following equation: (2) Y i e l d ( % ) = M o l e o f pro d u c t p r o d u c e d M o l e o f r e a c t a n t l o a d e d × 100 %"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterizations of catalysts,"3.1 Characterizations of catalysts 3.1.1 X-ray diffraction Fig. 1 (a) and (b) show the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of LDH structures in the Ni-based catalysts composed with Mg and Al. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 11.3, 22.8, 34.7, 39.1, 46.4, 60.6 and 61.9° were assigned to the (003), (006), (012), (015), (018), (110) and (113) crystal faces of magnesium aluminum hydroxide hydrate (JCPDS 35–0965), respectively. When Mg and Al were not present simultaneously in the precursor, the LDH structure can also been formed, as is shown in Fig. 1(b). Ni1.6Fe0.4 and Ni1·6Fe0·4Mg exhibited the diffraction peaks of iron nickel carbonate hydroxide hydrate (JCPDS 51–0463), and Ni1·6Fe0·4Al showed the diffraction peaks of nickel aluminum carbonate hydroxide (JCPDS 48–0594). The various formulations of the Ni-based catalysts affected the type of the precursor formed, which might further have important effects on the dispersion of Ni species. After the calcination, the Ni-based catalyst without the introduction of Fe or with a low content of Fe exhibited the diffraction peaks of NiO, as evidenced by the peaks at 2θ = 37.3, 43.4, 63.0, 75.6 and 79.6° belonging to the (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) crystal planes of NiO (JCPDS 75–0197), respectively. With the increase of Fe content, NiFe2O4 phase was formed in the NiFe-based catalyst (JCPDS 54–0964), and the calcined Fe2·0MgAl catalyst exhibited the diffraction peaks of MgFeAlO4, as is shown in Fig. 1(c). When Ni, Fe, Mg and Al were not present simultaneously, the diffraction peaks of the samples varied from one to another. NiO phase was present in both Ni1·6Fe0.4 and Ni1·6Fe0·4Al (Fig. 1(d)), and MgNiO2 was the main crystal phase in Ni1·6Fe0·4Mg due to the strong interaction between Ni and Mg [26]. After the reduction of the calcined catalysts with hydrogen, the XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 1(e) and (f). Ni2.0MgAl showed the diffraction peaks of metallic Ni species (JCPDS 87–0712), and the NiO species was also detected due to the passivation after the reduction. Ni1.8Fe0.2MgAl and Ni1·6Fe0·4MgAl with a low Fe content exhibited the diffraction peaks of FeNi3 (JCPDS 65–3244). With the increasing of Fe content, the diffraction peaks were assigned to Fe0·64Ni0.36 phase (JCPDS 47–1405). The catalysts, such as Ni0·4Fe1·6MgAl and Fe2·0MgAl, with a high Fe content, exhibited the diffraction peaks of metallic Fe species (JCPDS 87–0721). In addition, other NiFe-based catalysts also showed FeNi3 as the main phase, as is shown in Fig. 1(f). Mg had a strong interaction with Ni species, and MgNiO2 was detected in the reduced Ni1·6Fe0·4Mg catalyst. The particle size of Ni species or NiFe species was also calculated based on the typical diffraction peak, and the results are shown in Table 1 . It was found that the catalysts with Mg–Al LDH as the carrier exhibited high capability to disperse Ni species or NiFe alloy (Table 1, Entries 1 to 6). With the increasing of Fe content, Ni or NiFe crystallite size also increased gradually (Table 1, Entries 2 to 7), indicating that the introduction of Fe might facilitate the sintering of metallic species or Fe species might be inclined to grow over the Mg–Al carrier. Compared with different Ni1·6Fe0.4-based catalysts, the presence of both Mg and Al was of great importance to the dispersion of Ni or NiFe species, as Ni1·6Fe0.4 catalyst showed the biggest crystallite size than that in Ni1·6Fe0·4MgAl (40.2 nm vs 4.3 nm, Table 1, Entries 3 and 9). To further investigate the morphology and elemental compositions of the catalysts, the sample was characterized by TEM. 3.1.2 Transmission electron microscope Fig. 2 shows the results of TEM images of the Ni2·0MgAl and Ni1·6Fe0·4MgAl catalysts. The two samples exhibited the nanoflake-like structure, and the metallic particles were highly dispersed on the support. An obvious sintering of metallic species can be observed in Ni1·6Fe0·4MgAl catalyst when compared with the Ni2·0MgAl catalyst. The size of the Ni particles and Ni–Fe alloy was further characterized, as is shown in Fig. 2. Ni2·0MgAl showed a smaller Ni particles size, which was consistent with the results of XRD (Table 1, Entry 1). The introduction of Fe to Ni-based catalyst resulted in the sintering of Ni species and facilitated the growth of Ni–Fe alloy particles (Fig. 2(a)), which was also confirmed by the XRD results. As shown in Fig. 3 (a), the interlayer spacing of ca. 2.0488 nm was attributed to the (1 1 1) crystal face of FeNi3, further confirming the presence of FeNi3 phase. Fig. 3 (b)–(f) show that Ni, Fe, Mg, and Al were uniformly dispersed on the surface of the Ni1·6Fe0·4MgAl catalyst, further indicating that Mg–Al LDH as the precursor was beneficial for the dispersion of metallic Ni or NiFe species. The various formulations in Ni-based catalyst can also affect the porous structure of the catalysts, which was further investigated with N2 physical adsorption/desorption characterizations. 3.1.3 N2 physical adsorption/desorption Specific surface area, pore volume and pore size of the calcined Ni-based catalysts are shown in Table 1. Compared with other Ni-based and NiFe-based catalysts, Fe2·0MgAl exhibited the lowest surface area than other samples. Even though the Mg–Al LDH structure was present in Fe2·0MgAl catalyst, as is shown in Fig. 1(a), but Fe, as the trivalent metal ion, might destroy the porous structure of the catalysts. From Ni2·0MgAl to NiFeMgAl catalysts, the surface area firstly increased and then decreased with the increasing of Fe content, indicating that the introduction of Fe with a low content could facilitate the formation of mesoporous structure, but the increasing Fe content to a higher value could destroy the porous structure, resulting in a decreased surface area. It can conclude herein that the balanced distribution of both divalent and trivalent metal ions benefits for the formation of mesoporous structure of the catalysts. As is shown in Table 1 (Entries 9 to 11), Ni1·6Fe0.4 or Ni1·6Fe0·4Mg without the presence of MgAl or Al resulted in a lower surface area. Meanwhile, the pore volume and pore size were also improved due to the merging and growth of the pores with a small size to the big ones with a larger size. The various chemical compositions of the catalysts dramatically affected the formation of mesoporous structure. Fig. 4 shows the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and corresponding pore-size distribution curves of the catalysts. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of all samples were assigned to characteristic IV isotherms with H3-type hysteresis loops, confirming the presence of mesoporous structure in the catalysts [27]. In addition, the pore size distribution of all the samples were concentrated in the range of 2–30 nm, and the catalysts (Ni1·6Fe0.4 and Ni1·6Fe0·4Mg) without the presence of Al showed a bigger pore size than other catalysts, indicating that Al can lower the pore size of catalyst and facilitate the dispersion of metal Ni or NiFe species due to the formation of Mg–Al or Ni–Al LDH (Fig. 1(a) and b). The different physicochemical properties and the crystallite size in the catalysts might affect the reduction behaviors and the interaction between Ni species and the carrier, which was further investigated with the H2−TPR characterization. 3.1.4 Temperature programmed reduction in hydrogen Fig. 5 (a) and (b) show the H2−TPR curves of the various catalysts. Compared with Ni2·0MgAl and NiFeMgAl catalysts, the catalyst with the introduction of Fe species exhibited the hydrogen consumption peaks at a lower reduction temperature. Ni species in Ni2·0MgAl catalyst were more difficult to be reduced, due to the strong interaction between Ni species with MgO and Al2O3 [28]. With regard to NiFeMgAl catalyst, the hydrogen consumption peaks gradually shifted to a lower temperature with the increasing Fe content. The formation of Ni–Fe alloy, as is confirmed in Fig. 1(c), indicated that the strong interaction between Fe and Ni might help to enhance the reducibility of nickel oxide [23]. With regard to the Fe2·0MgAl catalyst, two reduction peaks centered at 512 and 750 °C belonged to the reduction of various Fe oxide species [29], as the XRD results indicated (Fig. 1(c)) that iron oxide could react with MgO and Al2O3 species, forming the MgFeAlO4 oxide that was apparently more difficult to be reduced. The formation of Ni–Fe bimetallic oxides could benefit for decreasing the reduction temperature, and the dissociation of hydrogen by Ni accelerated the reduction of Fe species or Ni–Fe alloy. Fig. 5(b) shows the H2−TPR profiles of Ni1·6Fe0.4, Ni1·6Fe0·4Mg and Ni1·6Fe0.4Al. Ni1.6Fe0.4 without the support exhibited a lower reduction peak due to weak interaction between Ni and Fe species. In addition, the catalysts were also characterized by H2−TPD to determine the amounts of exposed metallic sites of the Ni-based catalysts. Fig. 5(c) shows that Ni1·6Fe0·4MgAl possessed the highest amount of metallic hydrogenation sites, and the hydrogen uptake of Ni1·6Fe0·4MgAl was 72.7 μmol g−1, which was higher than that of other catalysts. Ni2.0MgAl catalyst exhibited a higher hydrogen desorption temperature, and a lower amount of the exposed metallic hydrogenation sites might be due to the incomplete reduction of Ni species in Ni2.0MgAl. Varied catalysts exhibited different hydrogen desorption peaks, and the desorption of hydrogen shifted to a higher temperature with the increase of Fe content, which might be due to that Fe species and Ni–Fe alloy sites enhanced the hydrogen adsorption ability [30]. Various chemical compositions of the catalysts played important effects on the textural properties and the reductivity of the catalysts. The impacts on the decomposition of the catalysts precursors during the calcination were also investigated with the TG characterizations. 3.1.5 Thermogravimetric analysis Fig. 6 shows the TG and DTG curves of Ni-based and Fe-based catalysts for investigating the decomposition of the LDH precursors during the calcination process under air. Two successive weight losses were observed for the decomposition of LDH precursors. The first weight loss, which centered at 105–250 °C, was assigned to the removal of interlayer water molecules and the dehydroxylation of the OH functional groups in LDH structure [31,32]. The second weight loss, which was observed at the temperature ranging from 300 to 700 °C, was attributed to the elimination of the carbonate anions located in inter-laminar spaces [33]. In addition, the weight loss of the different precursors was also calculated. With the increasing of Fe content, the mass loss gradually decreased, indicating that the presence of Ni ion, a divalent ion, benefited for the formation of LDH structure, which can contain more carbonate anions. Fig. 6(b) indicated that the temperatures of the first weight loss decreased with the increasing of Fe content, and the formation of Mg–Al LDH structure might suppress the removal of interlayer water molecules and the dehydroxylation of the OH functional groups [34]. On the contrary, the temperatures of the second weight loss in NiFeMgAl gradually increased and were higher than that of monometallic Ni2·0MgAl and Fe2·0MgAl, illustrating that the coexistence of Ni–Fe composites facilitated the improvement of the thermal stability and benefited for the retainment of carbonate anions. The catalysts composed of various elements might also affect the different distributions of basic sites, which were further characterized with CO2-TPD. 3.1.6 Temperature programmed CO2 desorption CO2-TPD was conducted to determine the distribution of basic sites, and the results are shown in Fig. 7 and Table 2 . The peaks ranging from 50 to 150 °C were attributed to weak basic sites; the peaks centered at 150–400 °C were assigned to the basic sites with moderate strength and the desorption peaks centered at 400–700 °C belonged to the basic sites with strong strength [35]. Ni2.0MgAl catalyst showed the lowest number of basic sites, mainly the ones with the weak to moderate strength. With the increase of Fe content, the catalysts exhibited a higher number of basic sites. As is shown in Table 2, the Fe2·0MgAl catalyst with the highest content of Fe possessed the highest number of basic sites. In addition, Ni1·6Fe0·4MgAl catalyst showed a higher amount of strong basic sites than other NixFeyMgAl catalysts, indicating that various formulations could tune the distribution of basic sites, especially for basic sites with strong strength. The presence of Fe species can benefit the formation of abundant basic sites, especially the ones with the strong strength. The co-existence of Ni and Fe species in the formulation of the catalysts also showed positive effects on the formation of the basic sites with the moderate strength. This was related to the change of the porous structures affected by these two metal species, resulting in the redistribution of metal species and the formation of new basic sites. The above results showed that the various chemical compositions of the catalysts dramatically affected the physicochemical properties of the catalyst, which might further impact the catalytic activity and was further investigated."
8,Catalytic activity,"3.2 Catalytic activity Table 3 shows results for the hydrogenation of furfural over the synthesized catalysts versus the different reaction temperatures. The monometallic Ni2·0MgAl catalyst showed a higher catalytic performance than other catalysts even though the reaction temperature was 110 °C. Furfural conversion of 81.1% was observed, which was higher than that of NiFe-based and Fe2·0MgAl catalysts (Table 3, Entries 1 to 5). Ni2.0MgAl catalyst has the highest content of nickel that acted as the active sites for the conversion of furfural via hydrogenation [36]. The rather low conversion of furfural over Ni1·6Fe0·4MgAl catalyst indicated the importance of nickel sites for the hydrogenation reactions. With the increase of reaction temperatures, the activity of all the catalysts was improved. Furfural was firstly hydrogenated to FA, and then the subsequent hydrogenation of FA to THFA was observed, especially over the Ni2·0MgAl catalyst (Table 3, Entries 6, 11 and 17). With the addition of Fe to the formulation of the catalysts, however, the complete hydrogenation of furan ring to form THFA was suppressed (Table 3, Entries 7 and 12). The FA formed thus had the chance to be further transformed into the diols via the hydrogenolysis reactions. It is worth noting that the NiFe-based catalysts could also facilitate the hydrogenolysis of FA to produce 2-MF, which was due to the presence of Ni–Fe alloy sites [37]. Fe2.0MgAl catalyst showed the lowest catalytic activity towards the hydrogenation of furfural. With the absence of Ni, Fe showed negligible performance for hydrogenation. The hydrogenation of furfural over Fe2·0MgAl was mainly attributed to the transfer hydrogenation over the abundant basic sites, as is confirmed by the hydrogenation of furfural in nitrogen atmosphere (Table S1). Diols as the targeting products were produced over Ni1·6Fe0·4MgAl, and the sum yield was 48.6% (Table 3, Entry 12), which should be attributed to the synergistic effect between Ni and Ni–Fe sites. The formation of Ni–Fe alloy can lower the catalytic activity of the catalyst and, most importantly, shift the targeting products from THFA to FA, creating the chance for the formation of the diols via hydrogenolysis of FA. As shown in Table 3, the yield of THFA can be up to 87.6% over Ni2·0MgAl (Entry 11), while the yield of FA can be up to 80.7% over Ni1·0Fe1·0MgAl (Entry 13). The production of the diols was optimized via changing the reaction parameters. The increase of catalyst loading did not further improve the diols yield due to the presence of side reactions (Table 3, Entry 16), indicating that the availability of the catalytic sites was not the main reason for the low yields of the diols. The reduction temperature of the catalysts could affect the alloying process of Ni and Fe, which was further investigated. The results indicated that increasing reduction temperature at 700 °C benefited the reduction of Ni species and the formation of Ni–Fe alloy (shown in Fig. S1). A higher yield of THFA was achieved (Table 3, Entries 17 to 19). On the contrary, when the reduction was performed at 500 °C, the alloying of Ni and Fe was difficult (shown in Fig. S1), and THFA was also produced as the main products with FA as the reactant. Therefore, 600 °C was the optimal reduction temperature, which can achieve the balanced distribution of both Ni species and Ni–Fe alloy for producing diols from furfural (Table 3, Entries 7 and 12). This is because that the metallic species are required for hydrogenation of furfural to FA, while the NiFe alloy formed is crucial for preventing the further hydrogenation of FA to THFA. Other NiFeMgAl catalysts were further evaluated to obtain the catalyst with the optimal formulation for the production of diols. As is shown in Table 3 (Entries 2 to 25), the results indicated that Ni1·6Fe0·4MgAl exhibited the superior catalytic activity among the investigated catalysts. In the formation of the diols, FA was an intermediate product, and the experiments with FA as the starting reactant were also tried. It was found that the yield of THFA obviously decreased over the catalyst with the introduction of Fe, further confirming that the alloying of Ni and Fe could efficiently suppress the formation of THFA and benefit for the ring-opening of FA to produce diols. A higher yield of diols (56.9%) was achieved over the Ni1·6Fe0·4MgAl catalyst (Table 4 , Entry 3). Ni1.0Fe1.0MgAl and Fe2·0MgAl showed a negligible activity towards the conversion of FA. When the reaction temperature was further increased to 200 °C, no obvious improvement of diols yield was observed, even though the yield of THFA was lowered, and the by-product (2-MF) could also be produced at an elevated reaction temperature (Table 4, Entries 7 to 10) [37,38], indicating that NiFe species was beneficial to produce 2-MF from FA. As the formation of THFA from FA was not completely suppressed, it would inevitably affect the hydrogenolysis of FA to produce diols. Other reaction conditions, such as hydrogen pressure and catalyst loading on the production of diols, were also further investigated. The results for the effects of hydrogen pressure are shown in Table S2. When the hydrogen pressure was increased from 4 to 6 MPa, the yield of diols, however, showed a negligible change (Table S2, Entries 1 to 14), as the production of THFA was not suppressed. Ni1.6Fe0.4MgAl still exhibited the highest yield of diols than other catalysts. A higher catalyst loading was also considered, no obvious increase of the diols yield was observed. Conversion of FA to THFA was inevitable, which might be due to the low activation energy of the production of THFA compared with that for producing diols. The specific roles of Ni species and Ni–Fe alloy in the hydrogenolysis of FA to diols were further investigated."
9,Understanding the roles of metal Ni and Ni–Fe alloy in hydrogenation of FA,"3.3 Understanding the roles of metal Ni and Ni–Fe alloy in hydrogenation of FA The roles of Ni and Ni–Fe species were investigated via evaluation of a series of Ni1·6Fe0.4-based catalystsin the hydrogenolysis of FA. As is shown in Table S3, Ni1·6Fe0.4 catalyst with the biggest FeNi3 particles size showed a lower conversion of FA, and the production of diols could also be achieved (Table S3, Entry 2). With regard to Ni1·6Fe0·4Mg and Ni1·6Fe0·4Al, the yield of diols was lower than that over Ni1·6Fe0·4MgAl, and the yield of THFA gradually increased (Table S3, Entries 3 to 5). Compared with these three catalysts, using Mg–Al LDH as the precursor could benefit for the dispersion of hydrogenation sites and the formation of more basic sites. Basic sites, especially for the basic sites with moderate and strong strengths, might be responsible for higher diols yield [16]. In addition, the mechanically mixed Ni2·0MgAl–Ni1.6Fe0.4and Fe2·0MgAl–Ni1.6Fe0.4 were also investigated as the catalysts (Table S3, Entries 6 and 7). Even though Ni species and Ni–Fe sites were present during the hydrogenation of FA, THFA was obtained as the main product, indicating that the coordination between Ni species and Ni–Fe sites was of great importance to suppress the complete hydrogenation of furan ring to form THFA and catalyze the hydrogenolysis of FA to produce diols. Herein, the possible reaction pathways were proposed in Scheme 2 , and diols with a higher yield can be achieved over NiFeMgAl catalyst with both Ni species and Ni–Fe alloy sites, as is shown in Scheme 2(b). To further investigate the hydrogenation process of FA over the different catalysts, the in-situ DRIFTS characterization of the hydrogenation of FA on surface of the catalyst was conducted, as shown in Fig. 8 , Fig. S2 and Table 5 . Fig. 8 showed the changing of various functional groups [39–41], and the representative functionalities were summarized in Table 5. The spectra of standards, such as FA, diols and THFA, were also analyzed and the results are shown in Fig. S2 (b). A higher ratio of CC in aromatic ring to C–O was observed over Ni2·0MgAl than that over Ni–Fe based or Fe-based catalysts, indicating that a strong adsorption of CC in furan ring took place over Ni2·0MgAl catalyst. The alloying of Ni and Fe species could effectively lower the adsorption of CC in furan ring on surface of the catalyst, which thus suppressed the complete hydrogenation of furan ring of FA to form THFA. The results in Table 3 have also confirmed that a higher yield of THFA was achieved over Ni2.0MgAl. The ratio of C–O–C to C–O decreased from Ni2·0MgAl to Fe2·0MgAl, and the adsorption of the FA over Ni2·0MgAl was higher than other catalysts (Table 5, Entries 2, 6, 10 and 14). The adsorption of C–O–C in furan ring was responsible for the ring-opening of furan ring to form diols rather than the adsorption of CC in furan ring. A ratio of Ar–C (hydroxymethyl group on the furan ring) to C–O over the catalyst followed the order: Fe2·0MgAl > Ni1·6Fe0.4 > Ni1·6Fe0·4MgAl > Ni2.0MgAl. The hydrogenation or ring-opening of FA resulted in the decrease of the abundance of Ar–C group and the formation of -(CH2)n-group [42], as is shown in Fig. S3. Herein, Ni1·6Fe0·4MgAl catalyst, possessing the strong adsorption of C–O–C and weak adsorption of CC in furan ring, exhibited superior activity for the hydrogenation of furfural to diols, which can be attributed to the synergy between Ni species and Ni–Fe sites over Ni1·6Fe0·4MgAl."
10,Catalytic reusability,"3.4 Catalytic reusability The results for the reusability of the prepared catalysts are shown in Fig. 9 . After the reuse of the catalyst for four times, a negligible decline in THFA selectivity over Ni2·0MgAl and an obvious increase in THFA selectivity over Ni–Fe based catalysts were found. However, conversion of FA was still up to 100.0%, and the decreasing catalytic activity to produce diols might be due to the partial deactivation of the active sites. XRD and TG characterizations of the spent catalysts were further performed. Fig. 10 shows that a slight increase of Ni or Ni3Fe particles size occurred during the recycle process. The particle size should not be responsible for the decreasing diols selectivity. As is shown in Fig. 10 (b), TG analysis of the spent and fresh catalysts was carried out, and the spent catalyst showed an obvious weight loss when compared with the weight increment that was due to the oxidation of metallic species of the fresh catalyst in air [43]. These results confirmed that the formation of coke resulted in the deactivation of the catalyst. When the spent Ni1·6Fe0·4MgAl catalyst was further regenerated at 600 °C for 30 min in hydrogen flow, the regenerated Ni1·6Fe0·4MgAl catalyst showed a comparable diols selectivity with the fresh Ni1·6Fe0·4MgAl catalyst (Run 5). The polymeric substance could decompose via pyrolysis during the treatment with the reduction. Therefore, the bimetallic Ni–Fe catalysts can maintain a superior catalytic activity and stability for the hydrogenation of furfural or FA, and the deactivated catalyst can be recycled via the simple regeneration. However, how to further improve the diols selectivity over the Ni–Fe catalysts and the stability of the Ni–Fe catalysts needs to be taken into further consideration."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, the hydrogenation of biomass-derived furan compounds to diols was investigated over NiFe-based catalysts. The results showed that the use of Mg–Al LDH as the precursor of the support benefited for the dispersion of metallic sites via facilitating the formation of the mesoporous structures. The introduction of Fe to Ni-based catalyst weakened the interaction between Ni species with the support, enhanced the formation of the abundant basic sites with moderate and strong strengths and formed the Ni–Fe alloy species on surface of the catalyst. Monometallic Ni-based catalyst catalyze the full hydrogenation of furfural to THFA, due to the strong adsorption of CC group in furan ring on surface of the catalyst. The presence of Ni–Fe alloy could enhance the adsorption of C–O–C group in the furan ring and weakened the adsorption of CC group in furan ring, which can thus suppress the further hydrogenation of FA to form THFA. The synergistic effect between Ni species and Ni–Fe alloy in the NiFe-based catalysts achieved the effective hydrogenation of furfural to FA and created the opportunities for the subsequent hydrogenolysis of FA to form diols. The catalyst was resistant to sintering in the hydrogenation of furfural to diols, and it could be recycled via simply pyrolysis of the carbonaceous polymer formed during the reduction with hydrogen."
