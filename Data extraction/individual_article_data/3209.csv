0,Introduction,"It was reported in Outlook for Energy [1], about 25% more affordable and reliable energy for homes, transportation, business and industry will be needed from 2014 to 2040 due to increase in the world's population from about 7.2 billion to 9 billion by 2040. It is expected that fossil oil will still be predominant in 2040 for the transportation sector, while the demand for diesel engines in the transportation sector will increase from 35% in 2014 to about 40% by 2040. This will cause a challenge to the availability of diesel fuel and increase in emissions from diesel engines. In addition, the cleaner production and sustainability of energy, which are concerned about the operations and maximization of waste reduction, reusing and recycling in the environments [2], has drawn increasing attention for environmental protection. It can be seen from the literature that several techniques have been applied to solve these problems like the use of emission catalysts, different fueling systems, modern combustion technologies or alternative fuels. In recent years and even in the future, the use of alternative fuels (biofuels) in diesel engines seems to be attractive and promising because the biofuels can be produced from renewable and sustainable sources. Among all the alternative fuels, biodiesel, lower and higher alcohols or their blends with diesel fuel have been utilized in many studies to investigate their effects on the combustion, performance and emissions characteristics of different diesel engines. In most of the former investigations, the effects of using different percentage of an alternative fuel, and hence different percentage of oxygen, in the blended fuels were studied. However, very few studies were conducted using blended fuels with the same oxygen content. For example, Wang et al. [3] used blends of diesel with biodiesel, ethanol or diglyme with the same oxygen content for comparison; but the carbon, hydrogen and lower heating values of their blended fuels were almost different. Their experiments were conducted with five diesel–biodiesel blends and diesel–diglyme blends with oxygen concentration of 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10%, and four diesel–ethanol blends with oxygen concentration of 2, 4, 6 and 8%, under ﬁve engine loads and at the engine speed of 1800 rpm. It was found that different blended fuels having the same oxygen content, have different effect on the emissions, especially on PM emission. On the other hand, a few studies have been performed to compare the influence of different alternative fuels, each having the same blending ratio, on the performance and emissions of diesel engines. For instance, Kumar et al. [4] examined the impact of higher alcohol/diesel blends on the combustion and exhaust emissions of a single-cylinder, naturally-aspirated, constant-speed (1500 rpm), four-stroke, direct-injection (DI) diesel engine under four loads (1.3, 2.6, 5 and 5.3 BMEP). The tests were performed with pure ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) and four blended fuels (30% by volume of iso-butanol, n-pentanol, n-hexanol or n-octanol blended with ULSD). The results revealed that the iso-butanol blend had the longest ignition delay (ID), highest peaks of pressure and heat release rate (HRR) and the shortest duration of combustion (DOC) in comparison with the other tested fuels. In regard to the emissions, it was observed that iso-butanol blend had the lowest smoke opacity, NOX and CO emissions and highest HC emission compared to the other tested fuels. The lowest HC value was recorded for n-octanol blend. In addition, Yilmaz et al. [5], examined the effect of quaternary blends of diesel (D), biodiesel (B), higher alcohols (propanol (Pro) and pentanol (Pen)) and vegetable oil (VO) on fuel properties and engine performance and emissions on a four-cylinder diesel engine generator at different engine loads with constant engine speed of 1800 rpm. Four blended fuels of DB (D50-B50), DBVOPro (D40-B40-VO10-Pro10), DBVOPen (D40-B40-VO10-Pen10) by volume percentages were used. It was found that DBVOPro had higher BSFC and lower NOX compared to DB. It was also observed that the addition of both higher alcohols into the DB caused increase in CO and HC emissions. In another study, Atmanli [6] analyzed the basic fuel properties, engine performance and exhaust emissions of a diesel engines fueled with diesel (D), biodiesel (B), propanol (Pr), n-butanol (Bu) and 1-pentanol (Pe). Experiments were carried out on a four-cylinder indirect injection (IDI) diesel engine generator under a constant engine speed of 1800 rpm with four engine loads. Six fuels and blends were used, including pure diesel, pure biodiesel, D50B50, D40B40Pr20, D40B40Bu20 and D40B40Pe20 (by volume percentage). In respect of basic fuel properties, it was found that addition of all the alcohols into the blends of diesel–biodiesel caused an improvement in cloud point and cold filter plugging point and slight decreases in cetane number (CN), lower heating value (LHV), density, kinematic viscosity and flash point. In regard to the engine performance, the results showed that the Pr blend had the highest brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC); while the Bu blend had the highest brake thermal efficiency (BTE). For emissions, all the ternary blends caused an increase in CO (Pe blend had the highest CO emission), while HC emissions were reduced signiﬁcantly with the Bu blend and the Pe blend but increased with the Pr blend in comparison with D50B50. It was also found that all the ternary blends could lead to reduction of NOX, with the Pe blend having the lowest NOX emissions. Yilmaz et al. [7] also investigated the influence of some higher alcohols on the performance and exhaust emissions of a four cylinder IDI diesel engine generator under different loads and at an engine speed of 1800 rpm. 10% (by volume percentage) of propanol, n-butanol, and 1-pentanol was added separately into the waste oil methyl ester (B100) to form the blended fuels, B90Pr10, B90Bu10, and B90Pe10, respectively. It was observed that all the blended fuels led to increases in BSFC and exhaust gas temperature in comparison with B100. However, the BTEs of B90Pr10 and B90Bu10 were reduced, while B90Pe10 had a slight rise in BTE compared to B100. In regard to emissions, all the blended fuels had lower CO and NOX emissions compared to B100; while B90Pe10 had the lowest HC emissions among all the tested fuels. Imdadul et al. [8] analyzed the influence of biodiesel (B), n-butanol (Bu) and pentanol (Pe) on the performance and regulated emissions of a single cylinder, four-stroke, DI diesel engine under different engine speeds. Seven fuels were tested, including diesel (D), D85B15, D70B15Bu15, D70B15Pe15, D80B20, D60B20Bu20 and D60B20Pe20 (by volume percentage). It was found that the blended fuels containing an alcohol improved the brake power and BSFC and reduced the CO and HC emissions in comparison with those of diesel fuel, while, the effect of pentanol was better than that of n-butanol on the engine performance and emissions. According to the aforementioned literature review, most of the former studies are focused on (a) effect of increasing alternative fuel concentrations; (b) effect of using the same percentage of different alternative fuels and (c) effect of different alternative fuels blended to the same oxygen concentrations (but different fuel C, H and LHV), using biodiesel or a few alcohols. All of those studies, according to the authors' knowledge, have been performed with blended fuels having different percentages of carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) contents and different lower heating values (LHV). The differences in C, H, O and LHV do not allow the establishment of similar conditions for comparing various fuels in regard to the engine performance and emissions. Engine performance and emissions are affected by many factors, which include the C/H ratio, oxygen content and lower heating value of the fuel. It is of interest to know how the blended fuels would affect engine performance and emissions if such parameters are fixed. In addition, there is lack of investigation on comparing the effects of lower alcohols (methanol and ethanol) with higher alcohols (butanol, pentanol and propanol) on the same engine under the same operating conditions. Therefore, the present research aims at covering the above knowledge gaps by conducting experiments on a diesel engine with six blended fuels which have almost the same percentages of C and H and the same percentage of O in the resultant composition and hence they also have almost the same lower heating values as shown in Table 3 , involving the use of biodiesel produced from waste cooking oil and both lower and higher alcohols. The use of constant or almost constant O, C, H and LHV for all the blended fuels proposed in this study provides a unique and similar condition for comparing the effects of different blended fuels, allowing the effects of these parameters be neglected and the influence of other fuel properties be identified."
1,Experimental setup and procedure,"The tested engine was a 4-cylinder direct injection (DI), water-cooled diesel engine. Similar engines are still used in Hong Kong and China for the small trucks. An eddy-current dynamometer and Ono Sokki heavy diesel engine test system were employed to control the engine speed and torque. The specifications of the engine and schematic diagram of the experimental setup are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1 , respectively. A heated flame ionization detector (300 HFID, CAI Inc.) was used to record HC, NOX was measured by using a heated chemiluminescent analyzer (600 HCLD, CAI Inc.) and CO and CO2 were analyzed through the non-dispersive infrared analyzers (300 NDIR, CAI Inc.). All the sampled gaseous emissions were directly taken from the engine exhaust line. Before each test, the gas analyzers were calibrated with zero and standard (span) gases. In regard to the measurement of particulate emissions, the exhaust gas was sampled from the exhaust manifold through an insulated and heated sampling line to prevent the condensation of volatile substances and deposition of solid particles on the interior pipe wall. A two-stage mini-diluter (Dekati Ltd, Finland) was employed to dilute the exhaust gas. The first stage of diluter was heated by use of an electrical heater while the second stage was not heated. The actual dilution ratio (DR) in the present study was calculated according to the following equation. (1) D R = [ C O 2 ] e x h a u s t − [ C O 2 ] b a c k g r o u n d [ C O 2 ] d i l u t e d − [ C O 2 ] b a c k g r o u n d where [CO2] exhaust is the CO2 concentration of the exhaust gas before dilution, [CO2] background is the CO2 concentration in the background and [CO2] diluted is the CO2 concentration after dilution. In this research, depending on the engine operating conditions, the first-stage dilution ratio varied from 5.3 to 5.8 and the second-stage dilution ratio varied from 44.4 to 57.5. The first-stage output from the dilutor was connected to a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM 1105, Rupprecht & Patashnick Co., Inc.) for measuring the particulate mass concentration while the second-stage diluted exhaust gas with a sampling rate of 3 L/min was sent to a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS, TSI Inc.) for recording the particle size distribution and number concentration with a size range of 15–750 nm. The SMPS consists of a TSI 3022 condensation particle counter (CPC) and a TSI 3071A differential mobility analyzer (DMA). For particle number concentration and size distribution, four measurements were recorded at each operating condition and the average of the four measurements is presented. In addition, all gaseous emissions and particulate mass concentration were recorded over a period of 5 min to obtain the average values over the 5-min period. The fuel consumption was measured with an electronic balance with a precision of 0.1 g. The exhaust gas temperature was measured with a K-type thermocouple. In the present study, the experiments were conducted at a constant engine speed of 1800 rpm with five engine loads of 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90% of the full engine torque, corresponding to 28.5, 85.5, 142.5, 199.5 and 256.5 Nm. The engine was warmed up for several minutes before starting of measurements. Then, at each operating condition, the engine was allowed to run for a few minutes until the exhaust gas temperature, the cooling water temperature, the lubricating oil temperature as well as the CO2 concentration reached the steady-state conditions and data were recorded subsequently. Seven fuels were used in present research, which include ULSD (ultra-low-sulfur diesel) (D), waste cooking oil biodiesel (B), lower alcohols (methanol (M) and ethanol (E)) and higher alcohols (2-propanol (Pr), n-butanol (Bu) and n-pentanol (Pe)), were blended with various blending mass percentages to obtain six blended fuels with constant fuel oxygen, almost constant carbon and hydrogen contents and almost constant lower heating values. The six blended fuels are designated as DB (D53.7 B46.3), DBM (D82.74 B9.26 M8), DBE (D79.25 B9.26 E11.49), DBPr (D75.71 B9.26 Pr15.03), DBBu (D72.22 B9.26 Bu18.52) and DBPe (D68.76 B9.26 Pe21.98). In each blended fuel, the fuel oxygen content was maintained at 5.0%. When an alcohol was added, the biodiesel was kept at 9.26% to provide 1% oxygen while the content of diesel fuel was reduced and the alcohol was added to contribute 4% of the oxygen. Since methanol has the highest oxygen content, hence DBM contains only 8% methanol, comparing with 21.98% of pentanol for DBPe. It can be seen from Table 3 that the carbon contents vary from 82.2% to 81.7%, the hydrogen contents differ from 12.8% to 13.3% and the lower heating values change from 40.2 MJ/kg to 40.3 MJ/kg for the blended fuels. Fuel samples were prepared and observed for three weeks to understand the stability of the six blended fuels. For all the blended fuels, no phase separation was observed during the experiments. Except DBM, the other blended fuels were stable for three weeks. For the DBM sample, phase separation occurred after approximately 10 h. The use of surfactants (emulsiﬁers), co-solvents [9] or higher percentage of biodiesel can solve the miscibility problem of methanol in DBM fuel. Since all the alcohol blended fuels (irrespective of DBM) were stable with 9.26% of biodiesel (using low percentage of biodiesel to better sensing of alcohols' effects on the parameters) without using any chemical surfactants, the methanol suffered a phase separation in DBM fuel; while the chemical surfactants (or higher percentage of biodiesel) could not be utilized for DBM fuel due to fixing of a same condition compared to the other blended fuels. Therefore, since no phase separation occurred during the experiments for the DBM case, the results pertaining to DBM are included in this study for comparison. All the alcohols used in this study had high purities of over 99.8%. In addition, the biodiesel was produced by a local company (Dynamic Progress) using waste cooking oils collected from the restaurants and the biodiesel qualities were in compliance with EN14214 standard. The compositions of the waste cooking oil biodiesel are shown in Table 2 and the properties of the tested fuels are presented in Table 3. The steady state experiments of this study were repeated two times for ensuring that the data were repeatable within the experimental uncertainties of the measurements. The experimental uncertainties at 95% confidence level in the measurements were calculated based on the methods proposed by Moffat [10] and the results are presented as the error bars in the Figures. The experimental results were compared using the two-tailed Student's T-test to verify if they are significantly different from each other at 95% significance level."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Engine combustion,"3.1 Engine combustion The following parameters were selected to analyze the effect of alternative fuels on the engine combustion characteristics and performance: in-cylinder pressure, heat release rate (HRR), ignition delay (ID), duration of combustion (DOC), coefficient of variation (COV) of indicative mean effective pressure (IMEP), COV of maximum cylinder pressure derivative (Max (dP/dθ)), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and brake thermal efficiency (BTE). Combustion characteristics were obtained according to the in-cylinder pressure and HRR measurements on the average of 500 cycles to minimize the influence of cycle-to-cycle variations. First Law of Thermodynamics was employed to convert the pressure data to heat release rate data by using the commercial software DEWESoft™ (DEWETRON GmbH). Start of combustion (SOC) is defined as zero crossing of heat release (which means the beginning of rapid pressure rise or the beginning of heat release) in the unit of crank-angle degree (°CA). Ignition delay is the interval between start of fuel injection (8 °CA BTDC) and SOC. End of combustion (EOC) is the point at 95% of heat release. Duration of combustion is defined as the interval between SOC and EOC. Typical curves of in-cylinder pressure and HRR are shown in Fig. 2 for low (28.5 Nm), medium (142.5 Nm) and high (256.5 Nm) engine loads. Fig. 3 (a and b) reveals the peak in-cylinder pressure and peak HRR, respectively. The similar in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate curves of the blended fuels with diesel (Fig. 2) indicates that alternative fuels have undergone similar combustion process, including a premixed combustion phase followed by a diffusion combustion phase. Figs. 2 and 3 (a) illustrate that the in-cylinder pressure increases, with the peak value occurring further away from the top dead center, with rise in the engine load for all the tested fuels which is due to more fuel consumption at higher loads [15]. Similar behavior was observed in Refs. [9,12,16,17] with diesel, DB, DBE and DBM. However, for HRR, Figs. 2 and 3 (b) show that the peak HRR increases with rise in load only from 28.5 Nm to 142.5 Nm (except for D and DBPe at 199.5 Nm) and then it decreases at the high load (256.5Nm) for all the tested fuels. Similar trend in the peak HRR (rise in peak HRR at low and medium loads and reduce at high engine load) was also reported in the literature [12,16,18] for diesel, biodiesel and DBE. Figs. 2 and 3 (a) illustrate that all the blended fuels cause a slight reduction in the peak in-cylinder pressure at the low engine load (except DB and DBM) and a slight rise at the medium and high loads in comparison with diesel fuel. However, on the average of five loads, peak in-cylinder pressures of all the blended fuels have only about 1% increase (almost similar) compared to that of diesel. Thus, there is no significant difference between the blended fuels on the peak in-cylinder pressure. The small drop in peak in-cylinder pressure at low load for the blended fuels is due to the lower combustion temperature and the higher ignition delay (compared to other loads and use of diesel) which cause initiation of combustion further away from the top dead center during the expansion stroke [12,16]. For HRR, all the blended fuels (irrespective of DB) leads to an increase in the peak HRR at all loads compared to pure diesel, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3 (b). This increase in the peak HRR can be attributed to the better volatility and lower viscosity (better fuel atomization) of the alcohols and the longer ignition delay associated with the lower cetane number of the alochols which cause accumulation of more fuel during the delay time to burn in the premixed burning phase and hence the higher peak HRR [4,19,20]. In contrast, the higher viscosity and lower ignition delay of biodiesel cause decrease in the peak HRR in comparison with diesel. On the average of five loads, the higher alcohols have the same trend in the increase of peak HRR, about 22.1% increase for DBPe, DBPr and DBBu, compared to that of pure diesel. However, the lower alcohols cause less increase in the peak HRR, being 14.8% for DBE and 5.9% for DBM. In contrast, biodiesel has a reduction of 3% in the peak HRR. Same behavior (increase in peak HRR for alcohols and reduction in peak HRR for biodiesel) was also found in Ref. [4] for DBB and DBPe and [17] for DB. It can be inferred that the magnitude sequence of the peak HRR is almost dependent on the ignition delay of the fuels (as shown in Fig. 4 (a)). Fig. 4 (a and b) indicates the variations of ignition delay and duration of combustion of the tested fuels, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 4 (a and b) that the increase in engine load causes decrease in ID and increase in DOC for all the tested fuels. The ID is reduced due to increase in in-cylinder temperature [21] as a consequence of rise in engine load. For DOC, the increase in load leads to rise in duration of fuel injection, air/fuel mixture formation [22] and fuel combustion. Fig. 4 (a and b) demonstrates that all the blended fuels (except DB) cause increase in ID and drop in DOC in comparison with those of diesel fuel. The lower cetane number and higher latent heat of evaporation of the blended fuels, as a consequence of the alcohols, cause decrease in in-cylinder temperature and increase in ID compared to diesel fuel [23–25]. For DB, the higher bulk modulus and higher viscosity of biodiesel cause earlier start of combustion and reduction in ID [26,27]. The drop in DOC with use of alcohol in the blended fuels has various reasons. Firstly, the addition of alcohols into the blended fuels leads to achieve higher HRR in the premixed combustion phase caused by the longer ignition delay [28]. Secondly, faster flame propagation of alcohols can shorten the DOC [29]. Thirdly, oxygen content of alcohols can decrease the pyrolysis process and enhance the oxidation during combustion resulting in shorter DOC [30]. On the average of five engine loads, the increase in ID is in the order of DBPr (9.7%), DBPe, DBBu and DBE (6.7%) and DBM (1.7%) compared to diesel, while DB has a reduction of 3.9% in ID. The longest ID of DBPr is due to the slower H-abstraction and inhibition of isomerization in the branched chain alcohols (2-propanol was tested) compared to the straight chain alcohols [31]. For DOC, the average results show that the higher alcohols have similar effect in reduction of DOC (about 2.3% for pentanol, propanol and butanol) while the lower alcohols have less influence in reduction of DOC (1.1% for methanol and ethanol) compared to that of diesel. In addition, biodiesel has an identical DOC (only 0.6% increase which was not significant with T-Test at 95% level) in comparison with that of diesel. It can be found that the sequence of DOC is almost opposite the ID of the fuels. Coefficient of variation in indicated mean effective pressure (COVIMEP) is an important parameter of cyclic variability. COVIMEP is defined as the cyclic variability in indicated work per cycle. This parameter is calculated based on the standard deviation in IMEP divided by the mean IMEP, and is usually expressed in percent, while an excess of 10% in COVIMEP could result in vehicle drivability problems [32]. Fig. 5 (a) shows that the COVIMEP (for 500 working cycles) of all the tested fuels varies with engine load while the maximum and minimum COVIMEP are recorded at 28.5 Nm and 85.5 Nm, respectively for all the tested fuel, except for DBM and DBE. The higher COVIMEP at the lowest load (28.5 Nm) indicates a bigger variation of indicative work done among each cycle due to less stable combustion associated with the lower combustion temperature and incomplete combustion. The average data in Fig. 5 (a) reveals that despite of a slight reduction in COVIMEP by using DBM (only 1.6%), the application of alternative fuels causes increase in COVIMEP in the order of DBBu and DB (9%), DBE (7.8%), DBPe (5.8%) and DBPr (2.7%) compared to that of diesel fuel. Coefficient of variation in maximum cylinder pressure (COV Max(dP/dθ)) is another indicator of combustion process which shows whether the combustion process of an engine is fast and robust or that is slow and less repeatable [32]. COV Max(dP/dθ) also can implicitly reflect the level of combustion noise. Fig. 5 (b) illustrates that the COV Max(dP/dθ) (for 500 working cycles) of all the tested fuels (irrespective of DBBu) increases from low load (28.5 Nm) to medium load (142.5 Nm) and then decreases until the highest tested load (256.5 Nm). It can be clearly seen from Fig. 5 (b) that the use of different fuels has various effects on COV Max(dP/dθ) compared to diesel. Biodiesel causes a reduction of 3% and methanol has an identical value (only 0.5% reduction) in COV Max(dP/dθ) in comparison with diesel; while the other blended alcohols fuels lead to increase in COV Max(dP/dθ) in the sequence of DBPe (12.8%), DBPr and DBBu (7.5%) and DBE (1.4%). Fig. 6 indicates the variation of exhaust gas temperature (EGT) with engine load. It is clearly observed that the increase in engine load causes increase in EGT for all the tested fuels. With increase in engine load, more fuel is injected into the cylinder for burning which causes the rise in in-cylinder temperature and thus increase in EGT [6]. The average data in Fig. 6 shows that all the alternative fuels lead to slight decreases (about 1.5% for all blends) in EGT compared to diesel. This small reduction in EGT is due to the lower heating value and higher latent heat of evaporation (cooling effect) of the alcohols and biodiesel which can reduce the combustion temperature [33] and thereby reduce the EGT compared to diesel fuel. According to Fig. 6, the maximum reductions are recorded at 256.5 Nm for all the blended fuels which shows that the alternative fuels have a strong influence on reductions of EGT only at higher engine loads."
4,Engine performance,"3.2 Engine performance Variations of BSFC and BTE are presented in Figs. 7 and 8 , respectively. It can be seen that the best engine performance occurs at 199.5 Nm which has the highest BTE and the lowest BFSC for all the tested fuels. At low engine loads, the combustion temperature is low, therefore incomplete combustion takes place; on the other hand, at very high loads, the combustion temperature is high and the fuel/air ratio is richer, however there is not enough time for mixing of fuel and air, resulting in incomplete combustion and decrease in BTE and increase in BSFC. Fig. 7 also illustrates that all the blended fuels have higher BSFC (except for DBM at 256.5 Nm) at all the tested loads compared to diesel fuel. Lower calorific value (due to using alcohols and biodiesel) and lower density (due to use of alcohols) of the blended fuels are the reasons leading to the increase in BSFC compared to ULSD [6,14,34,35]. And in order to maintain the same output power by the blended fuels, more fuel is required. The increases in BSFC on the average of five loads are found as about 6.6% (DBE, DB, DBPr and DBPe), 4% (DBBu) and 2.3% (DBM) compared to that of diesel. For BTE, the average results of five loads show that DBM (3.5%) and DBBu (1.5%) have higher BTE and other blended fuels have similar BTE (about 1% reduction which is not significant with T-test) in comparison with diesel fuel. The higher or similar BTEs (despite of increases in BSFC) of the blended fuels is due to the lower fuel viscosity, improvement in fuel atomization and increase in oxygen contents which improve the combustion process for converting the chemical energy of fuel into the useful engine work and thereby increase the BTE compared to ULSD [16]. It can be inferred from the above results that DBM shows the best performance, because it has the lowest BFSC among all the tested blended fuels and the highest BTE among all the tested fuels. Methanol has the shortest chain and the lowest molecular weight [14] among all the tested alcohols which leads to easier ignition and better combustion and hence resulting in the lowest BSFC and the highest BTE. In addition, the lowest boiling point of methanol among the tested alcohols causes reduction in heat losses and hence resulting in higher BTE."
5,Exhaust gaseous emissions,"3.3 Exhaust gaseous emissions Fig. 9 shows the variation of BSCO2 with engine loads. It can be seen from Fig. 9 that the behavior of BSCO2 is almost similar to that of the BSFC (Fig. 7) at different engine loads. It is also found that the lowest BSCO2 is recorded at 199.5 Nm (which also has the lowest BSFC) and the highest BSCO2 is observed at 28.5 Nm (which also has the highest BSFC) for all the tested fuels. Fig. 9 also illustrates that all the blended fuels (except DB) can reduce BSCO2 compared to diesel fuel. Similar trend in reduction of BSCO2 with ethanol and DBE was reported in Refs. [16,28,36] and a slight increase and no significant effect in CO2 was found in Ref. [37] using pure biodiesel (5.63% increase), DB50 (2.77% rise) and DB20 and DB10 (identical) compared to diesel. The lower carbon-to-hydrogen ratio and the higher oxygen content of the blended fuels cause reduction of BSCO2 in comparison with ULSD [36,38,39]. The reduction percentages in BSCO2 are 8.2% for DBM, 3.2% for DBBu and about 1.8% for DBE, DBPe and DBPr, compared to ULSD, which are similar to the results of BSFC. Moreover, DB has an identical BSCO2 (a slight increase of 1.4% was not significant with T-test) compared to diesel. It can be inferred that only DBM is effective on the reducing BSCO2, with a magnitude of 8.2%, which is due to its lowest BSFC (Fig. 7) among all the tested fuels. The other blended fuels have almost similar effect on the BSCO2 compared to diesel. The effects of increase in in-cylinder temperature and complete combustion as a subsequence of rise in engine load (except at 256.5 Nm) on reduction of BSCO emission can be seen in Fig. 10 . Similar behavior was observed in Ref. [28] for DBE. Fig. 10 also depicts that all the blended fuels (except DBM at 85.5 Nm) cause BSCO increase at lower loads (28.5 and 85.5 Nm) and decrease at higher loads (199.5 and 256.5 Nm) compared to diesel fuel. On the average of five loads, the reductions in BSCO using all alternative fuels are in the order of DBM (23.9%), DB (11.3%), DBPr and DBBu (6.4%), DBPe (3.5%) and DBE (only 0.4%) in comparison with diesel. Other studies also found reductions in CO for DB and DBBu [40] and for DBPe [41]. At low load the effect of lower combustion temperature (cooling effect due to higher latent heat of evaporation) dominates the effect of oxygen content of the blended fuels (complete combustion), which suppress the CO oxidation process, resulting in the increase in BSCO emission compared to diesel [21,36]. However with rise in engine load, the effect of combustion temperature becomes weaker and it can be seen at higher tested loads the BSCO emissions of the blended fuels are lower than that of ULSD. It can be found from the above results that DBM has the highest influence on reduction of BSCO (23.9%) which can be attributed to better combustion and performance (lowest COVIMEP and BSFC and highest BTE) of DBM compared to the other blended fuels. After DBM, DB shows high effect on reduction (11.3%) in BSCO which can be attributed to the long duration of combustion, and hence longer time for oxidation of CO to CO2, as shown in Fig. 4 (b). Fig. 11 depicts that the increase in load causes decrease in BSHC for all the tested fuels. At low engine load the combustion temperatures are insufficient to initiate complete combustion resulting in increments of BSHC emissions for all the tested fuels. However, at higher loads the combustion temperatures are high enough to achieve a more complete combustion, leading to decrease in BSHC for all the tested fuels. Fig. 11 shows that all the blended fuels (irrespective of ethanol at 85.5 Nm) can reduce the BSHC from 85.5 Nm to the highest engine load (256.5 Nm). The increase in BSHC at the lowest load with the blended fuels is similar to that in the case of BSCO (Fig. 10), which is due to incomplete combustion as a consequence of higher latent heat of evaporations of alcohols and biodiesel compared to ULSD. However, the effect of higher oxygen content of the blended fuels is a dominant factor at higher engine loads (from 85.5 Nm to 256.5 Nm) which causes more complete combustion and increases the oxidation of unburned hydrocarbons at higher in-cylinder temperatures [42] resulting in lower BSHC emissions compared to ULSD. Some studies also found a rise in THC at lower and even medium loads and a reduction at higher load with the use of alcohols blends (like DBE [28,43], DBBu and DBPe [6] and BPn [7]) compared to diesel. In addition, other studies found that the use of DE and DBE [25,44,45], DBPe [41] and diesel blended with ethanol or methanol [46] can increase the combustion quality, due to more oxygen content in the fuel, and reduce the THC, in comparison with diesel fuel. On the average of five engine loads, the reductions in BSHC are in the order of DBM (24.3%), DBPe, DBPr and DB (12.3%) and DBE and DBBu (8.8%) compared to diesel fuel. It can be concluded from the above results that, similar to BSFC and BSCO, the effect of using DBM on reduction of BSHC (24.3%) is higher than the other blended fuels which is due to better combustion and performances of DBM (lowest COVIMEP and BSFC and highest BTE). The other blended fuels have almost similar impacts on the reductions of BSHC. Fig. 12 shows that the BSNOX approximately decreases with rise in load which is in line with other studies with use of diesel and DBE [16,28] and diesel, DBu and DPe [4]. Fig. 12 also reveals that all the blended fuels (except DB at all loads and DBPe at 28.5 Nm) cause decreases in BSNOX at all the tested loads compared to diesel fuel. On the average of five loads, reductions in BSNOX with use of the blended fuels are in the order of 19.3% (DBPr), 14.2% (DBM), 11.7% (DBPe), 4.7% (DBE) and (DBBu); while DB has an increase (5.8%) in BSNOX in comparison with that of diesel. Despite of the huge effect of combustion temperature on formation of NOX, it can be found from the above results that length of combustion duration (residence time) also has an effect on NOX formation. Because, DBPr has the highest impact on the reduction of BSNOX (23.3%) among all the tested blended fuels due to its shortest duration of combustion, as shown in Fig. 4 (b), for formation of NOX. On the other hand, DB leads to rise in BSNOX (5.8%) which can be attributed to the highest duration of combustion. In addition, Koivisto et al. [31] reported that the increase in alcohol branch (from 1-Octanol to 3-Octanol or adding two methyl group branches to 3-Octanol to form 3,7-Dimethyl-3-octanol) caused reduction in NOX emission due to increase in ignition delay and decrease in adiabatic ﬂame temperature. The 2-propanol used in this study has higher branch than the other alcohols, which DBPr has the longest ID (Fig. 4 (a)) and lowest NOX (Fig. 12). Reduction in BSNOX was also reported in some studies using ethanol [16,28], butanol and pentanol [4] and butanol and propanol [14]. In addition, the increase in NOX using biodiesel was also reported in many studies as mentioned in the review paper [47]. It can be inferred from the above result that the effects of higher latent heat of evaporation and lower heating value of alcohol fuels are dominant factors compared to other parameters (like lower cetane number and higher oxygen content of blends which increase the combustion temperature) which cause reduction in BSNOX for different loads."
6,PM emissions,"3.4 PM emissions Fig. 13 illustrates that the increase in engine load (except at 28.5 Nm) leads to rise in BSPM for all tested fuels. The small reduction in BSPM from low load (28.5 Nm) to medium load and then increase until the highest load (256.5 Nm) was reported in other studies [12,16] for DBE and diesel. At higher engine loads, the shorter time available for soot oxidation [19] causes increase in soot formation, resulting in a rise of BSPM. Also, the fuel/air mixture is richer and there is lower oxygen concentration for soot oxidation. Moreover, the ignition delay becomes shorter; therefore, more fuel is burned during the diffuse combustion period, resulting in a rise in PM emissions [42]. Fig. 13 also shows that the utilization of blended fuels (except DB at 25.8 and 85.5 Nm) has a positive effect on the reduction of BSPM at various loads compared to ULSD. According to the average of five loads, the reductions in BSPM are in the sequence of DBE and DBM (70%), DBBu (61%), DBPr (46.2%), DBPe (32.6%) and DB (only 5.2%) compared to diesel fuel. This finding is in line with some other studies for DBE [12,48], pentanol [42], butanol and pentanol [49] and DBE and DBM [15]. The reasons for the decrease in BSPM with oxygenate fuels can be attributed to the following factors. Firstly, there are lower aromatic and sulfur contents (except DB) in the blended fuels [42]. Secondly, higher oxygen content of the blended fuels enhances the soot oxidation, because through the hydroxyl radical (•OH) formation, the oxygen component consumes the soot precursors which causes lower soot formation [33]. Thirdly, the carbon to hydrogen mass ratio of all the blended fuels is lower than that of diesel fuel [42]. It is found from the above results that all the alcohol fuels have huge effects on the reductions of BSPM; while DB shows a small effect (only 5.2% reduction) on BSPM compared to the other tested fuels. The small impact of DB on the reduction of BSPM is due to its shortest ignition delay and hence longer diffusion combustion period, (resulting in higher particle mass formation). In addition, the bonding of two oxygen atoms of biodiesel as R (CO) OR with one carbon [50,51] causes the decomposition of CH3O(CO)• radical to form CO2 (CH3+CO2) instead of CO formation (CO + CH3O) [52–54]. While, for reduction in soot formation, each oxygen atom can remove one carbon atom from the reactive pool (consuming the soot precursors by oxygen atoms); however, for biodiesel, the two oxygen atoms can only remove one carbon atom which is less efﬁcient [50,54] compared to the fuels containing one oxygen atom in their structure like alcohols. Therefore, biodiesel shows the weakest effect on the reduction (only 5.2%) of BSPM in comparison with the other blended fuels with alcohol (especially DBE and DBM with 70% reduction). On the other hand, the lowest BSPM of the DBE and DBM fuels can be attributed to the shorter chains of methanol and ethanol which lead to easy extraction of oxygen atoms from the decomposition of their molecule structures resulting in higher consumption of soot precursors by these free oxygen atoms compared to the longer-chain alcohols like propanol, butanol and pentanol. Figs. 14 and 15 depict that the increases in engine load cause increases in both total number concentration (TNC) and geometrical mean diameter (GMD) of the PM for all the tested fuels. In other studies, the increases in TNC and GMD of diesel and DBE [16], diesel and pentanol [42] and diesel, butanol and pentanol [49] with rise in engine load were also reported. Some factors have influences on the increase of TNC with rise in engine loads. For example, lower availability of time for soot oxidation at high loads [19] causes increase in particulate formation; richer mixture at high loads, reduces oxygen concentration for soot oxidation; shorter ignition delay at high loads causes burning of more fuel during the diffuse combustion period [42]; or incomplete combustion due to lack of enough mixing time for fuel and air at high loads. Moreover, as the number of particles increase, the particles coagulation rate increases and hence larger particles are formed, leading a rise of GMD [55]. Figs. 14 and 15 also show that all the blended fuels have a positive influence on reduction of TNC (irrespective of DBPr and DBPe at 142.5, 199.5 and 256.5 Nm) and GMD for different loads. On the average of five loads, the reductions in TNC are in the order of DBE (37.3%), DBBu (31.1%), DBM (22%), DB (9%) and DBPe (only 1.1%) compared to diesel; while DBPr has an identical TNC (only 0.2% increase which was not significant with T-test) with diesel. For GMD, the average results show that the decreases are in the sequence of DBPr, DBE, DBBu and DBPe (10.3%) and DB and DBM (5.25%) in comparison with diesel fuel. The decreases in TNC and GMD with use of alternative fuels (ethanol, butanol and pentanol) were also found in the literature [12,16,42,49]. Lower aromatic and sulfur contents (except DB) and lower carbon to hydrogen mass ratio of the blended fuels [42] and higher oxygen content (enhances the soot oxidation) [33] of the blended fuels contribute to the reductions in TNC and GMD compared to those of diesel fuel. In regard to the effect of ID on PM, Koivisto et al. [31] found that the use of an alcohol caused increase in total particle number and smaller particle size compared to those of hydrocarbon fuels due to longer ignition delay of the alcohols. In the present study, the highest TNC and lowest GMD are also recorded for DBPr which has the longest ignition delay."
7,Conclusions,"The present experimental research was conducted to investigate the impact of using biofuels on the combustion, performance and emissions of a diesel engine at a constant engine speed of 1800 rpm with five engine loads (10%–90% of the full load). Seven fuels were used, including diesel (D), biodiesel (B), two lower alcohols (methanol (M) and ethanol (E)) and three higher alcohols (2-propanol (Pr), n-butanol (Bu) and n-pentanol (Pe)) with various blending mass percentages to obtain constant fuel oxygen content and almost constant carbon and hydrogen contents and lower heating values. The blended fuels are designated as DB, DBM, DBE, DBPr, DBBu and DBPe. The major conclusions drawn from the present study include the following points based on the average results of the five engine loads and compared to the reference fuel (diesel). • The peak in-cylinder pressures of all blends had only about 1% increases (almost similar). • For the peak HRR, the higher alcohols caused higher increase of peak HRR (22.1%) and the lower alcohols (DBE with 14.8% and DBM with 5.9%) caused lower rise in peak HRR; while, the DB had a reduction of 3% in peak HRR. • All the blended fuels (except DB with 3.9% reduction) led to the increase in ID in the order of DBPr (9.7%), DBPe, DBBu and DBE (6.7%) and DBM (1.7%). • For the DOC, the higher alcohols had a similar effect in reductions of DOC (2.3%), methanol and ethanol caused a slight drop of 1.1% in DOC; while biodiesel had similar DOC. • For engine performance, all blends had higher BSFC in the order of about 6.6% (DBE, DB, DBPr and DBPe), 4% (DBBu) and 2.3% (DBM). • DBM (3.5%) and DBBu (1.5%) had higher BTE and other blends had similar BTE. • In regard to the emissions, the reductions in BSCO2 were found as 8.2% (DBM), 3.2% (DBBu) about 1.8% (DBE, DBPe and DBPr); while DB had similar BSCO2. • All the blended fuels caused reduction in BSCO in the order of DBM (23.9%), DB (11.3%), DBPr and DBBu (6.4%), DBPe (3.5%) and DBE (only 0.4%). • Also all blends had lower BSHC in the sequence of DBM (24.3%), DBPe, DBPr and DB (12.3%) and DBE and DBBu (8.8%). • Reductions in BSNOX were recorded in the order of 19.3% for DBPr, 14.2% for DBM, 11.7% for DBPe and 4.7% for DBE and DBBu; however DB caused an increase of 5.8% in BSNOX. • Reductions in BSPM were in the sequence of DBE and DBM (70%), DBBu (61%), DBPr (46.2%), DBPe (32.6%) and DB (only 5.2%). • All blends caused reductions in TNC in the order of DBE (37.3%), DBBu (31.1%), DBM (22%), DB (9%) and DBPe (only 1.1%); while DBPr had similar TNC with diesel. • For GMD, the decreases were in the sequence of DBPr, DBE, DBBu and DBPe (10.3%) and DB and DBM (5.25%). Despite all the blended fuels have almost the same C/H/O compositions and lower heating values, there are some differences in the influence of each fuel to the combustion, performance and emissions of the diesel engine, even among those fuels with alcohols. According to the average of five engine loads, it was observed that all the tested blended fuels using alcohols had almost similar trends on the engine combustion, performance and emissions; while, the use of biodiesel blend (DB) had opposite trends in some parameters. In detail, the alcohols blends had higher HRR, ID and COV Max(dP/dθ) and lower DOC, BSCO2 and BSNOX in comparison with diesel fuel; however, biodiesel blend (DB) had lower HRR, ID and COV Max(dP/dθ), higher BSNOX and similar DOC and BSCO2 compared to those of diesel fuel. It is noticeable that all the blended fuels with alcohol can reduce both NOx and particulate emissions, which are major problems with diesel engines. Moreover, they have higher PM reduction effects than the DB fuel. In addition, it was found that DBM showed the best engine performance (highest BTE among all the fuels and lowest BSFC among all the blends) and had the lowest emissions (BSCO2, BSCO, BSHC, BSPM and BSNOX (after DBPr)), COVIMEP and COV Max(dP/dθ) (after DB) compared to all the other tested fuels. In contrast, DB had the weakest influences, compared to the other blended fuels."
