0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is considered a promising energy vector in the context of the increasing worldwide energy demand [1]. Even more, its use for transport applications in vehicles equipped with Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) represents an environmentally friendly alternative that produces electricity efficiently [2]. Hydrogen obtained from any carbon-containing molecule (such as hydrocarbons or alcohols) will inevitably contain a certain amount of carbon oxides. As it was mentioned, PEMFC are especially attractive to motorize electrical vehicles due to their low operation temperature, low weight, low start-up times and high energy density [3]. Nevertheless, to operate at such low temperatures (80–120 °C), PEMFC needs platinum-based anodes that become severely poisoned by CO concentrations even at ppm levels [4]. Consequently, carbon monoxide must be removed from the hydrogen produced in the upstream process before it can be fueled to the PEMFC. Many alternatives have been proposed in the literature for this purification stage including, for example, adsorption processes with temperature or pressure swings [5,6], hydrogen separation in membranes reactors [7,8] or CO/CO2 methanation in catalytic reactors [9,10]. As it can be seen from some of our previous works, our approach was the implementation of catalytic reactors (located downstream the H2 production unit) where Water Gas Shift (WGS), Eq. (1), and CO preferential oxidation (COPROX), Eqs. (2) and (3), reactions take place. (1) CO + H 2 O ↔ C O 2 + H 2 (2) CO + 1 / 2 O 2 → C O 2 (3) H 2 + 1 / 2 O 2 → H 2 O To this purpose, we have developed catalysts for both reactions combining several metals with ceria ceria-lanthana, or ceria-praseodymia supports [11,12]; noble metals (Pt, Ir, Pd) were tested for COPROX reaction [13] while transition metals such as Co, Cr, Zn [14], Mn [15], Ni and Cu [16,17] were tested for both WGS and COPROX reactions. Besides, other authors have also shown that the performance of copper-ceria catalysts for WGS and COPROX reactions can be largely improved by dispersing it on a high surface area alumina carrier, which could be explained by an enhancement of the oxygen mobility on the small ceria particles dispersed on alumina [18]. Active catalyst is disposed regularly in the so-called structured reactors [19]. A particular group of those are the monolith reactors comprising regular channels where the active catalyst is located. In this configuration, the void fraction of the reactor is extremely high (ca. 70% to 90%), which allows to considerably reduce the pressure drop with respect to conventional fixed bed reactors loaded with cylindrical or spherical catalyst pellets [20]. Additionally, monolithic reactors have the following advantages compared to fixed bed reactors: higher effectiveness factors, lower overall mass transfer resistance and easier cleaning [21]. Cordierite monoliths washcoated with noble and transition metal-based catalysts supported on ceria, such as Au-Re/CeO2 [22], CoMn/CeO2 [23] or CuO-CeO2 [24], have shown to be very active in Water Gas Shift and CO preferential oxidation reactions. Based on what was previously stated, the aim of this work is to prepare, characterize and evaluate the catalytic performance for WGS and COPROX reactions of γ-Al2O3-coated cordierite honeycomb monoliths impregnated with Cu-Ni/Ce-Pr mixed oxides. Along the manuscript, the catalytic behavior of these systems is compared to their respective powder catalytic formulations reported in some of our previous works."
1,Experimental,"The samples studied in the present work were prepared by wet impregnation of γ-alumina-coated cordierite honeycomb monoliths (400 cells per square inch, square edges = 1.3 mm and 0.1 mm wall thickness, SBET = 150 m2/g, Poral volume = 0.44 cm3/g). Bare samples (1 cm wide and 1.5 cm length) were slowly submerged at a constant rate during 5 s into a Ce (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, Fluka >99.0%) or CePr solution (Pr(NO3)3·6H2O, Aldrich 99.9%) and kept submerged for 3 min. Solution concentration was calculated according to desired Pr content and poral volume in order to incorporate a single monolayer of the further mixed oxide [25]. The [Pr] to [Pr] + [Ce] ratio were varied among 5, 15, and 25 %. These monoliths were withdrawn at the same rate, blown 1 s per side with N2 to remove the excess of solution and, dried at 70 °C overnight. Finally, they were calcinated at a 450 °C for 5 h with a 10 °C/min rate. An adherence evaluation was performed following a similar procedure described in literature submitting the samples to an ultrasound bath in acetone at RT for 10 min (80 W) [26]. The whole procedure was repeated to obtain a loading of redox oxides (Ce or Ce-Pr) close to 30 %wt verified by the sample weight change (with a final SBET = 129 m2/g). According to the previous method applied for powder ceria-based samples [13], these monoliths were coated once with active phase by wet impregnation with Cu, Ni, or CuNi 1–1 mass ratio with nitrate solutions, following the same procedure described above in order to obtain an active phase content close to 5 %wt. relative to redox oxide mass (this value is hereafter considered as a nominal one). Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were performed in a Micromeritics Auto Chem II 2920 instrument, equipped with a TCD detector coupled to a Pfeiffer Quadstar mass spectrometer. An H2/Ar stream (4 %v/v H2, 50 cm3/min) was passed over 120 mg of samples (1.0 cm wide and 0.75 cm length monoliths), while operation temperature was raised from RT to 900 °C using a 10 °C/min temperature ramp. Preceding TPR tests, samples were treated at 450 °C for 60 min under airflow in order to clean the surface. SEM micrographs were acquired with a Zeiss microscope Zupra 40 model equipped with a Gemini Column and field electron emission. Energy dispersive spectroscopy were performed in the same equipment. Catalytic activity for WGS reaction was typically evaluated with a mass close to 630 mg of structured catalysts (i.e.: 1.0 cm wide and 1.5 cm length) loaded in an isothermal tubular stainless-steel reactor heated by an electrical oven. Total inlet flow was equal to 150 cm3/min (contact time ≈ 0.09 g.s/cm3) with the following gaseous concentration: CO: 8 %v/v, H2O: 24 %v/v, H2: 45 %v/v, and N2 as balance, unless other conditions were mentioned. Before the catalytic tests, solids were cleaned at 400 °C with air flow for 30 min, purged with N2, reduced with 150 cm3/min of H2 (50 %v/v in N2) and then purged again with N2. Finally, temperature was raised to 450 °C under the reactant stream. Concentrations of CO and gaseous products were performed in a gas chromatograph equipped with a Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD). CO conversion and WGS selectivity (as undesired methanation reactions could occur, Eqs. (4) and (5)) were calculated in terms of molar flows entering and exiting the reactor, as following: (4) C O 2 + 4 H 2 → C H 4 + 2 H 2 O (5) CO + 3 H 2 → C H 4 + H 2 O (6) x CO % = F CO in - F CO out F CO in ∙ 100 (7) Selectivit y WGS = F C O 2 out - F C O 2 in F CO in - F CO out COPROX reaction activity tests were carried out in the same equipment as WGS reaction. Gas mixture composition, both at inlet or outlet of the reactor, were analyzed by gaseous chromatography using TCD and Flame ionization detectors. Catalysts were pretreated with air at 250 °C for 30 min. Then, reactant stream was fed to the reactor, while temperature was lowered from 250 to 100 °C monitoring outlet gas composition at each temperature to calculate CO and O2 conversions, and selectivity towards CO2, defined by Eqs. (6), (8) and (10) respectively. All catalytic tests were performed with the same contact time if other value is not specified (0.1 g.s/cm3) and the following composition, CO: 1 %v/v, H2: 79 %v/v, O2: 0.85 %v/v and N2 as balance. (8) O 2 c o n v e r s i o n % = F O 2 in - F O 2 out F O 2 in ∙ 100 (9) λ = 2 F CO in F O 2 in (10) S CO 2 = 1 λ x CO X O 2"
2,Results and discussion,
3,Reactor set up and characterization of monolithic samples,"3.1 Reactor set up and characterization of monolithic samples The starting samples were cordierite monoliths coated with a thin layer of γ-alumina, close to 18 % of total thickness. These solids were impregnated with cerium or mixed cerium-praseodymium oxides and then with the active phase, Cu and/or Ni, in order to obtain the optimized chemical formulation previously found for WGS and COPROX powder catalysts [16,25]. The desired redox oxide layer was acquired after two sequential stages (each of them consisting of impregnation, drying, calcination, and ultrasound cleaning steps) in order to reach a mass increase of approximatively 30 %wt. The first one increased the monolith mass in 18 ± 3%wt., and the second 34 ± 7 %wt. It is worth to be mentioned that a third stage would provide the sample with an almost 75 %wt., and some clusters would appear inducing a notable decrease in surface area. A fourth impregnation stage would increase up to 110 %wt. (twice as bare monolith mass) and some channels were blocked. Further details can be found in Supplementary material section. Consequently, for these alumina-cordierite monoliths, it was always employed two impregnation stages. With the purpose of analyzing the catalysts synthesis results, two monoliths were submitted to SEM and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy to determine the Ce profile in γ-alumina coating. One sample was cut at half to observe the cross section and the other longitudinally. Results are reported in Fig. 1 as the normalized composition (related to the average value) versus unidimensional length and thickness. No appreciable differences were found (<10%) suggesting that uniform profiles in coating are easily achieved with this synthesis method. Despite of the many advantages of monolithic catalysts such as low pressure drop, high homogeneous flow and high mechanical resistance [27,20], one possible disadvantage to overcome is the sealing of the side of the structure in contact with a tubular reactor [28]. The main issues are the flow canalizations that could reduce the performance of monolithic catalyst by decreasing the reactants flow through inner channels inducing a non-uniform flow. A first catalytic activity test was made for WGS reaction with and without blocking the outer channels employing quartz wool to experimentally determine the effect of the reactant flow at the spaces between the monolith and the reactor. The results obtained showed a slight decrease in CO conversion when outer channels were blocked, suggesting that less catalyst is in contact with reaction flow during this test. In fact, for our monolithic samples only 6% of the catalyst mass is deposited at the outer faces (calculated as the area ratio of inner and outer faces); a scheme of the cross section of a monolith inside the reactor and WGS results can be found in Supplementary material. However, a non-uniform flow distribution may be present in free monolith and quartz wool may be force the gaseous fed stream to flow through inner channels when is employed. Therefore, a computational fluid dynamics simulation (CFD) was made to elucidate this situation. The flow distribution inside the monolith was analyzed utilizing CFD. Mass and momentum conservation equations were solved using the finite element method. The flow profile velocity of gas through the channels was described by the Navier-Stokes equation considering laminar flow. Further, the gas has been assumed to obey the ideal gas equation under steady-state, incompressible, and isothermal conditions. The symmetry of the system allowed to simplify the geometry regarding only one-quarter of the cylindrical reactor. As it can be observed, the highest flow is always achieved in the center of the channels irrespective of where they are located inside the reactor, suggesting a uniform flow in contact with catalyst coated in monolith cells except for those between the outer surface of the monolith structure and the inner channels of the steel tube. Due to this non-uniform flow distribution in whole monolith, the space velocity of the reactive flow is different in these individual external channels (Fig. 2 ). A slower flow in outer channels was obtained indicating that most of the gaseous stream is in contact with catalyst coated in inner cells, 86% of total flow. By a simple geometrical calculation 81% of sample is coated in the walls of the inner channels, implying that pressure drop is slightly higher the outer ones in correspondence with a slightly lower flow as it can be seen in Fig. 2b. Besides, this observation is in agreement with the experimental results found for WGS reaction previously mentioned, which showed no appreciable bypass canalizations. In addition, contact time can be further calculated as total mass and gaseous stream ratio as an acceptable approximation."
4,Study of Pr-promoted ceria catalysts for Water Gas Shift reaction.,"3.2 Study of Pr-promoted ceria catalysts for Water Gas Shift reaction. According to previous results obtained for powder catalysts, the addition of Pr improves ceria redox properties like oxygen storage capacity and reducibility, favoring the activity for WGS reaction [11]. This trend was analyzed in the present work for Cu/and/or Ni/CePr monolithic catalysts. Routinary blank tests were performed for both Water Gas Shift and CO Preferential Oxidation reactions before recording the data presented in figures. In both cases, no appreciable CO conversion was verified in the operating temperature range. The activity values, xCO and selectivity towards WGS are reported in Figs. 3 and 4 respectively. CO conversion for copper catalysts markedly increases with Pr content in agreement with the results previously found for powder samples; CH4 is not observed at the reactor outlet gas stream implying that methanation reactions do not occur over copper-based catalysts (complete WGS selectivity can be observed in Fig. 4 for the whole temperature range explored). However, mild CO conversion values can be achieved even at the highest temperature studied; in fact, CO conversion is only 50% at the highest temperature (450 °C) for the best sample (CuCePr25). On the other hand, Ni catalysts show high xco values, close to 100 % for temperatures higher than 350 °C irrespective of Pr content. At lower temperatures, the conversion falls promptly except for NiCePr25 sample which kept a reasonable conversion even at 300 °C. The opposite trend was found for the selectivity towards WGS which is high at low temperatures but markedly falls for T ≥ 350 °C due to the occurrence of methanation reactions, Eqs. (4) and (5). This low selectivity is probably favored for the particle agglomeration of active phase during calcination step, as it was reported for powder catalysts [29]. In fact, present methanation conversion values are somewhat higher compared with our previous results for alumina pellets catalysts with similar composition, indicating a strong influence of mechanical support in reaction performance [16,30]. This observation is in good agreement with results reported by Jarvi et al., who studied the CO methanation reaction over nickel-alumina structured catalysts and found a better performance for monoliths over pellets [31]. The authors explained their observation by higher Ni particle sizes present in monoliths in comparison with pellets, apparently these latter improved the particle dispersion. In addition, particle agglomeration also induces a marked effect of reducibility loss as it be discussed later suggesting a correlation between both features. The bimetallic samples are the most promising for WGS reaction since they show an acceptable activity and selectivity, achieving almost 85% of conversion and selectivity values higher than 0.7 in a clear contrast with nickel monometallic samples (which promoted either activity or selectivity). Recently, a DFT study reported that adsorbed C-O bond are strengthened by copper addition in Ni/CeO2 clusters, also by decreasing the CO dissociation energy, therefore, a CH4 production are hindered for this bimetallic catalyst [32]. Besides, at 400 °C the CuNi/CePr15 present the highest CO production by WGS among all samples studied in the present work (xco multiplied by selectivity) comparable with powder catalysts [33]. As it can be seen, this moderate Pr content is the most adequate followed by a slightly lower performance of CuNiCePr25 sample. Fig. 5 presents a temperature-programmed reducibility analysis for samples with 15 %at. of Pr. Catalysts, irrespective of the active phase, show a reduction event close at 80 °C that is not identified in the support profile (CePr15) [16] suggesting that these high reducible particles might be due to exposed edges of cut monoliths to fit in TPR reactor (shown in Fig. S3). The main events are located at the 100–340 °C range; no superficial reduction event of cerium-praseodymium mixed oxide, usually noticeable around 400 °C, can be identified, but a smooth peak might be observed at T ≈ 700 °C (close to bulk CePr cations reduction temperature) [16]. Besides, H2 uptake that can be calculated from profiles exceeds the theoretical required to reduce all active metal oxide, indicating that Ce and Pr cations are also reduced to some extent in the low temperature region (Table 1 ). This reduction step at low temperature aims to a synergic effect between the active phase and CePr oxide, which is more pronounced for copper catalyst. In fact, the most reducible species were shown by the copper catalysts, with a main peak at 171 °C and a shoulder at the low temperature side (located around 150 °C). This profile is quite similar to that observed for powder and alumina supported samples although peak positions are shifted to higher temperatures in the present case, indicating a slightly lower reducibility for monolithic catalyst [33,30]. In the case of Ni sample, less reducible species are observed with the main peak position close to 266 °C and a minor peak at 207 °C. Again, a similar peak distribution by comparing with powders was observed, but for the monolithic sample the reduction events are located at higher temperatures, revealing lower reducibility in consonance with the low WGS selectivity observed for the monoliths. Bimetallic catalyst shows a reduction profile similar to that of monometallic copper sample with a main peak at 165 °C and a very small shoulder at the low temperature side. Besides, a high temperature peak is observed at 240 °C, which might be assigned to the reduction event of nickel species (located 20 °C higher in the monometallic nickel monolith). These features suggest that reducibility behavior of bimetallic sample may be a combination of both monometallic catalysts, with a synergic effect of reduced copper species over nickel ones, in agreement with WGS activity and selectivity results. Therefore, reducibility improvement (Fig. 5) and selectivity (Fig. 4) may be correlated to a higher energy barrier for adsorbed-CO dissociation in CuNi cluster (as it was mentioned above), and a lower CO adsorption heat in NiCu alloy when copper is introduced [34]. The previous screening of catalysts helps to select the most promising sample including different features such as the active phase formulation and the promoter content. The bimetallic sample with 15 %at. of Pr is selected as the most adequate and submitted to different WGS reaction conditions with the purpose of exploring its performance. Two contact times were tested for this sample, 0.04 and 0.08 g s/cm3, easily achieved by changing the monolith length from 1.5 to 3.0 cm. The results show a slightly higher CO conversion at the higher contact time (results reported in Supplementary material) in the middle temperature range (325–400 °C) and no appreciable changes for higher temperatures, as a result of thermodynamic equilibrium limitations (400–450 °C), as will be discussed. The effect of the presence of CO2 in the feed is performed over CuNi/CePr15 sample and the results are reported in Fig. 6 . In this experiments, N2 flow is modified to balance CO2 contents (0 %v/v, 4 %v/v, and 8 %v/v). The equilibrium CO conversion values are also plotted in Fig. 6 for the sake of comparison, with dotted lines considering only WGS equilibrium and with solid lines including CH4 to this mixture (allowing to methanation reactions). As it can be seen, CO2 addition decreases dramatically the theoretical value for WGS reaction, whilst those lines corresponding to equilibrium considering the presence of CH4 remain almost unmodified, viz. the maximum theoretical xco decreased from 72 % to 52 % for WGS, but the values kept over 90 % if methane is included in thermodynamic equilibrium. The maximum CO conversion values (at highest temperature) decreased from 81% to 53% when reactor feed ratio CO2:CO changed from 0:1 to 1:1. This marked decrease was also reported by Özyönüm and Yildirim for an Au-Re-Ce monolithic catalyst [22]. It is interesting to note that the monolith almost achieves the CO conversion corresponding to WGS equilibrium at 400 °C and exceeds equilibrium values at 450 °C (for the three feed compositions studied), suggesting the occurrence to some extent of CO and/or CO2 methanation reactions, Eqs. (2) and (3). In fact, selectivity values are lower than 1 for T ≥ 375 °C in agreement with this previous observation. In addition, no appreciable changes in selectivity values towards WGS are found by CO2 incorporation at reactor feed stream (except for the highest studied temperature), indicating that CuNi/CePr15 sample might hinders CO2 methanation. In the low temperature region in Fig. 6 (T <350 °C) the equilibrium xco values show a minor change in contrast with CO conversion which drastically decreased by CO2 addition, i.e.: at 300 °C equilibrium values changed from 88 to 79% when experimental xco values dropped from 10 to 1% (comparing 0 and 8% CO2 content). Besides, the selectivity towards WGS is very close to 1 in this temperature range. Therefore, both features suggest that CO2 may block the CO adsorption on the surface of catalyst. As CO2 action is usually related to site blocking and decreasing catalytic activity, a stability analysis was performed with a feed stream including CO2. The same sample, CuNi/CePr15, was submitted to three sequential runs in the same WGS conditions, and xco and selectivity were monitored (see Fig. 7 ). The results do not reveal appreciable changes in catalytic activity performance, suggesting that CO2 presence (despite CH4 production) does not induce active sites blocking. Besides, no significant crystallite size increase seems to occur due to H2O exposure, in contrast with what was evident for the equivalent powder CePr supported-copper samples [16]. This is a positive feature of monolithic catalyst indicating that it is less affected by start-stop cycles, a common inconvenient in commercial catalysts [35]. In summary, the most promissory sample (CuNi/CePr15) has shown and acceptable activity-selectivity-stability performance with moderate contact times in comparison to literature cost-effective catalysts [36]."
5,Study of monolithic catalysts on CO preferential oxidation.,"3.3 Study of monolithic catalysts on CO preferential oxidation. According to previous results, Cu catalysts supported over pure ceria are highly active and selective for CO oxidation, partially hindering the simultaneous H2 conversion to water [17]. In the present work, this formulation was impregnated in a monolith with the purpose of determining its catalytic performance in comparison to powder samples. Contact time effect on catalytic performance of such samples was evaluated by testing three monoliths with different lengths at the same total molar flow, Fig. 8 (and evolution of molar flows with temperature can be found in Figs. S7-S9). CO conversion increased with contact time for all temperatures tested, with minor changes between the largest values (2.5 cm, and 3.8 cm), see Fig. 8a. Since this feature presented a maximum at 140 °C then, oxygen conversion and selectivity should also be analyzed with the purpose of determining optimal contact time. As it can be seen, oxygen almost achieves complete conversion for T >140 °C irrespective of monolith length but, oxygen conversion strongly depends on the contact time for lower temperatures, see Fig. 8b. In addition, selectivity decreases as temperature increases because H2 oxidation is favored over CO oxidation reaction [38] as it is show in Fig. 8c. This observation suggests that selectivity-xco plot might be considered in the analysis. In fact, the proximity to the ideal behavior (located at right upper corner of the plot) indicates that a monolith tested with a medium contact time, 2.5 cm, achieves the highest selectivity keeping an acceptable CO conversion, Fig. 8d. As it was previously mentioned, carbon monoxide and hydrogen oxidations are competitive reactions, Eqs. (4) and (5). Therefore, it was also analyzed on catalytic performance, the oxygen stoichiometric excess, called λ. CO conversion shows a maximum close to 140 °C irrespective of λ employed as it is show in Fig. 9 a (details about molar flows evolution with temperature can be found in Figs. S10-S12). A slight difference can be found for T ≥ 160 °C range, where a higher oxygen excess results in higher xco at each temperature evaluated, in agreement with our previous results for powder and alumina pellets catalysts [37,38] and copper-ceria monolithic system reported in literature [39]. On the other hand, O2 almost achieved full conversion for this high temperature region with no appreciable influence of λ value, Fig. 9b. However, for the low temperature region, x O 2 is lower for higher stoichiometric excess suggesting a zero or a negative O2 order in CO and H2 oxidation reactions [40]. In line with this, selectivity monotonically decreases with T suggesting a faster H2 oxidation in comparison with CO, also showing lower values for higher oxygen excess (again, favoring H2 oxidation), see Fig. 9c. In summary, λ should be carefully adopted according to reaction temperature to avoid the undesired reaction. In fact, among the oxygen excess values evaluated, the most adequate is the intermediate value (λ = 2) balancing CO conversion with a moderate O2 content as it can be deduced from the selectivity versus xco plot in Fig. 9d. A long-term run was performed on a monolithic sample with the purpose of determining the stability and tolerance to carbon dioxide and water. CO and O2 conversions are plotted in Fig. 10 . As it can be seen, both conversions remain stable for the first period of the test (t <19 h) while the monolith is in contact only with CO, O2, and H2, indicating an acceptable performance of this sample. After that period, CO2 is introduced to the reactor (t = 21 h) and the catalytic performance dramatically changes. However, this effect is reversible upon CO2 withdrawal, in agreement with the observations made by other authors for monolithic catalysts [41,42]. Since this trend was found in several systems, different reasons were reported to explain this phenomenon: an inhibitory effect of CO2 over Cu2+ and Cu+ species competing with CO and H2 adsorptions respectively [43], and the occurrence of the reverse Water Gas Shift reaction [44]. On the other hand, H2O and CO2 simultaneous addition (t = 47 h) induces a stronger inhibitory effect in both oxidation reactions and CO and O2 conversions drop significantly. Some authors suggested that CO-H2O surface complexes like hydroxyls or carbonates are responsible for site blocking [45]. Finally, CO2 and H2O are removed from gaseous stream after 50 h of test. At this stage, CO conversion did not return to the original values indicating a permanent change in the activity of the sites, probably due to some species were still attached to the surface of the sample."
6,Conclusions,"Monolithic catalysts were successfully prepared and tested for H2 purification reactions, Water Gas Shift and CO preferential oxidation. Different studies were carried out in order to determine suitability in reaction by analyzing the chemical formulation, reactor feed composition, and contact time effects on activity, selectivity, and stability. The samples gained almost a 35% of mass with only two impregnations with a uniform distribution along monolith. The flow regime for the catalysts inserted into the tubular reactor was studied; a laminar flow was determined for all channels with a lower mass flow in outer ones (those in contact with tube wall), suggesting that canalizations do not occur during reaction in agreement with the results found for a preliminary WGS run. The monoliths employed for WGS reaction included praseodymium promoted ceria in order to enhance activity and selectivity as same as powder samples previously tested. The analysis of the Pr content proved that the activity-selectivity ratio of the active phase can be modulated by the addition of the promoter. In fact, a moderate value (15 at.%) improved the activity towards WGS hindering methanation reactions in Ni-containing monoliths while the highest Pr content tested (25 at.%) showed the best behavior among copper samples. Besides, the active phase composition was also studied and bimetallic catalysts presented the best performance due to the interaction of copper with nickel particles in agreement with the synergic effect found in H2-TPR tests. The catalytic activity evaluation with different contents of CO2 at the reactor inlet demonstrated that WGS thermodynamic equilibrium was exceeded at the highest temperature evaluated, indicating the simultaneous presence of methanation reactions and proving that this catalyst may remove, with an acceptable contact time, 50–80% of the CO almost satisfying the COPROX process inlet requirements. Since this is a technological-oriented study, the bimetallic sample was also submitted to a stability test involving three consecutive runs in a WGS mixture atmosphere (CO-H2O-H2-CO2). CO conversions found were approximatively the same for different runs. In summary, the results obtained in the present work proved that this CuNi/CePr15 monolithic catalyst is active, selective, and stable. A Cu/ceria monolithic catalyst was submitted to COPROX reaction conditions. Temperature, contact time, and oxygen excess, were modified in order to improve activity-selectivity ratio. The results showed that the temperature should be carefully modified in order to balance CO and H2 oxidation reactions. By this reason, the selectivity-xco plots were also used to select the best parameters set. A sample >2.5 cm (with a total flow of 240 ml/min) does not show relevant improvement in CO conversion; in fact, it favors oxygen conversion decreasing the selectivity irrespective of the temperature employed. On the other hand, small contact times are not convenient to optimize CO conversion. Therefore, the moderate contact time was employed to evaluate the oxygen excess effect in catalytic performance. A value of λ = 2 was proved to be adequate for operation temperatures higher than 160 °C since larger λ tends to favor the undesired H2 oxidation. Otherwise, no important differences were found for different CO/O2 ratios at the 90–140 °C range, where CO and H2 reactions extent may be comparable one to each other. The selectivity-xco plot showed that the best parameters combination was λ = 2 and a temperature close to 130 °C. Then, this set was employed to carry out the long-term stability test of the sample. The first period proved that the catalyst was stable for several hours, and that the introduction of CO2 decreased xco and xO2 values but CO2 effect was reversible. However, the presence of H2O induced an undesired change in sample surface with a clear diminution of activity and selectivity in agreement with other catalysts reported in literature."
