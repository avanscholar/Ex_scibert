0,Introduction,"Growing concerns with severe global warming and fossil fuel depletion have prompted extensive research in pursuit of alternative and clean energy sources. Among the various candidates, hydrogen gas (H2) is regarded as the most promising future energy carrier as it has higher energy content by 2.75 times compared to hydrocarbon fuels (gasoline) and produces only water upon combustion. In addition, H2 can be directly used in a fuel cell, generating electricity with high efficiency (Momirlan and Veziroglu, 2002). The pioneering notion of a “Hydrogen Energy System” drew inspiration from the French science-fiction novel “The Mysterious Island” by Jules Verne (1874), where the idea of using H2 as an energy carrier first appeared (Mason, 2007). To date however, over 90% of the production of H2 remains based upon steam reforming of hydrocarbons and coal gasification, which starts from fossil fuels and requires high temperature and pressure conditions. Meanwhile, biological methods have great potential for the production of H2 in an environmentally friendly way. H2 is the most common element in the universe, and it is expected that the Earth’s early atmosphere was reducing one predominated by H2. At present, the atmosphere has turned to an oxidizing one, which was carried out mostly by biological processes that still continue (Vignais and Billoud, 2007). Many bacteria obtain energy by the oxidation of H2 assisted by a number of complex mechanisms, and O2 is released by the oxidation of water via photosynthesis. Meanwhile through a less well appreciated process, various species evolve H2 under anaerobic conditions. Actually, this is a proximate and everyday process for individuals: the bacteria in our digestive tract produce H2 (Cammack et al., 2001). However, most of this produced H2 is undetectable, because it is immediately recycled by other bacteria. Life depends on numerous series of chemical reactions, yet many of these reactions proceed too slowly on their own. Hence, nature has designed catalysts to greatly accelerate the rates of biochemical reactions, which we now refer to as enzymes (Copeland, 2000). The key enzyme involved in catalyzing H2 formation from protons or oxidation to protons is hydrogenase. The reaction (2H+2e− ↔H2) is reversible, and its direction depends on the redox potential of the components that are able to interact with hydrogenase (Vignais and Colbeau, 2004). In addition, nitrogenase, an enzyme that normally catalyzes the reduction of N2 to ammonia, is able to reduce protons to H2 as a byproduct under photo-heterotrophic conditions (McKinlay and Harwood, 2010). A study of hydrogenase is essential for understanding the H2 production mechanism, controlling cell metabolism, and finally increasing H2 production. Since 1931, when hydrogenase was first described by Stephenson and Stickland, extensive research has been conducted in this area (Mertens and Liese, 2004). The sequences of ca. 450 hydrogenases are now available, and they are well categorized by their specific characteristics and active site models have been developed (Meyer, 2007). In the present work, various aspects of hydrogenases (classification and properties), biological H2 production (BHP) systems, and genetic engineering work on hydrogenase for enhanced H2 production are reviewed."
1,Classification and properties of hydrogenase,"As categorized in Fig. 1 , various hydrogenases are known today, and all but one are involved directly or indirectly in energy metabolism either catalyzing H2 oxidation (H2 consumption) or H+ reduction (H2 evolution). One family of hydrogenase serves as H2-sensing components in the genetic regulation of hydrogenase expression, as found in several autotrophic Proteobacteria, e.g., Ralstonia eutropha, Rhodobacter capsulatus, and Bradyhizobium legyminosarum (Kleihues et al., 2000). Detailed investigation of sequences of various hydrogenases have confirmed that despite their diversity in many respects (size, structure, electron donors, etc.), hydrogenases could be split into three distinct classes, [NiFe]-, [FeFe]-, and [Fe]-hydrogenase depending on the metal atoms on their active sites (Meyer, 2007)."
2,[NiFe]-hydrogenase,"2.1 [NiFe]-hydrogenase [NiFe]-hydrogenases constitute the largest number of hydrogenases. It is considered that Ni-containing hydrogenases tend to be less sensitive than [FeFe]-hydrogenases to the inhibition by CO and O2 (Cammack et al., 2001). The core enzyme consists of a α, β heterodimer; the α-subunit being larger one and contains biometallic active site, whereas the small β-subunit possesses Fe–S clusters, which transfer electrons between the active site and electron accepter/donor binding site. As shown in Fig. 2 a, a bimetallic NiFe center is coordinated with the S-atoms of 4 cystein residues. Also, non-proteinous ligands, one CO and two CN are coordinated with Fe atom (Happe et al., 1997). A full sequence analysis of the small and large subunits led to the classification of [NiFe]-hydrogenases into four groups, which is consistent with the functions of the enzymes. Group I includes uptake [NiFe]-hydrogenases, which are generally found in Wolinella succinogenes, Aquifex aeolicus, Thiocapsa roseopersicina, and some Desulfovibrio sp. These enzymes are membrane-bound, which link the oxidation of H2 to the reduction of anaerobic electron acceptors, such as NO 3 - , SO 4 2 - , furmarate, or CO2 (anaerobic respiration) or to O2 (aerobic respiration), with the recovery of energy in the form of a proton-motive force. In terms of the structure, these enzymes are characterized by the presence of a long signal peptide at the N terminus of their small subunit (Sargent et al., 2006). The function of a signal peptide is to serve as signal recognition targeting the fully folded heterodimer to the membrane and the periplasm. Group II includes (a) cytoplasmic H2 sensors and (b) cyanobacterial uptake [NiFe]-hydrogenases, whose small subunit does not contain a signal peptide at its N terminus. Group II(a) enzymes remain in the cytoplasm, and their role is to detect the presence of H2 in the environment and to trigger a cascade of cellular reactions controlling the synthesis of hydrogenases (Kleihues et al., 2000). This type of hydrogenase has been found in Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Rhodobacter eutropha, Rhodobacter capsulatus, and Rhodopseudomonas palustris. I n contrast to the majority of hydrogenases, these enzymes are insensitive to O2. Group II(b) enzymes correspond to the uptake hydrogenases of the cyanobacteria Nostoc and Anabaena variabilis (Oxefelt et al., 1998; Happe et al., 2000a). These are induced under N2-fixing conditions and localized on the cytoplasmic side of either the cytoplasmic or thylakoid membrane. Group III, termed ‘bidirectional heteromultimeric cytoplasmic [NiFe]-hydrogenases’, function reversibly and can reoxidize the cofactors, such as cofactor 420 (F420, 8-hydroxy-5-5deazaflavin), NAD, or NADP. The dimeric hydrogenase module is associated with other subunits that are able to bind cofactors. Many members of this group are found in archea such as Methanothermobacter marburgensis and Methanosarcina mazei, which function to reduce So to H2S, use NADPH as electron donor, and provide reducing equivalents for heterodisulfide reductase (Ma et al., 2000). Group IV includes H2-evolving, energy conserving, membrane-associated hydrogenases which contain six or more subunits. The majority of these enzymes have been found in Archea, including Methanosarcina barkeri, Methanothermobacter marburgensis, and Pyrococcus furiosus. They catalyze H2 formation from reduced ferredoxin, which is generated by the oxidation of the carbonyl group of acetate to CO2 (Kunkel et al., 1998). Group IV hydrogenases have also been found in E. coli and R. rubrum, which reduce protons from water in order to dispose of the excess reducing equivalents produced by the anaerobic oxidation of C1 organic compounds of low potential, such as CO or formate (Sauter et al., 1992; Fox et al., 1996)."
3,[FeFe]-hydrogenase,"2.2 [FeFe]-hydrogenase Unlike [NiFe]-hydrogenases, composed of at least two subunits, many [FeFe]-hydrogenases are monomeric and contain only a catalytic subunit, which varies considerably in size. Besides the conserved domains of ca 350 residues containing the active site (H-cluster), they often comprise additional domains, which accommodate Fe–S clusters. The H-cluster consists of a binuclear [FeFe] center bound to a [4Fe–4S] cluster by a bridging cystein and attached to the protein by four cystein ligands. Non-proteinous ligands CN and CO are attached to both Fe atoms and two bridging sulfur atoms are coordinated with Fe atoms (Fig. 2b) (Adams, 1990). [FeFe]-hydrogenases have been found in anaerobic prokaryotes, such as clostridia and sulfate reducers, and in eukaryotes (Atta and Meyer, 2000; Horner et al., 2000). These are the only type of hydrogenases found in eukaryotes (Vignais and Colbeau, 2004). Generally, while [NiFe]-hydrogenases tend to be involved in H2 consumption, [FeFe]-hydrogenases are usually involved in H2 production. However, they were also reported to function as an uptake hydrogenase in D. Vulgaris, a formate dehydrogenase in Eubacterium acidaminophilum, and an electron “valve” that enables the algae to survive under anaerobic conditions (Graentzdoerffer et al., 2003; Happe et al., 2002; Pohorelic et al., 2002)."
4,[Fe]-hydrogenase,"2.3 [Fe]-hydrogenase This type of enzyme was found first in Methanothermobacter marburgenis, which catalyzes CO2 reduction with H2 to methane (Vignais and Billoud, 2007). It does not contain Fe–S clusters or nickel, and it was initially named as “metal free hydrogenase”. Later, it was renamed “iron–sulfur-cluster free hydrogenase” or simply [Fe]-hydrogenase (Shimas and Thauer, 2007). The structure of the active site and functional models have been reported in 2008 (Yang and Hall, 2008; Heinekey, 2009). This hydrogenase differs from the [NiFe]- and [FeFe]-hydrogenases not only by the primary and tertiary structures but also by the fact that the iron, required for enzyme activity is not redox active. They do not catalyze 2H+ +2e− ↔H2 reversible redox reaction."
5,Nitrogenase,"Nitrogenase, the enzyme that catalyzes N2 fixation, is essential for the maintenance of the nitrogen cycle on earth. A broad range of microorganisms, including both archaea and bacteria, has been found to contain this enzyme (Gallon, 1992). During N2 fixation, nitrogenase is also capable of producing H2. Nitrogenase occurs in molybdenum, vanadium, and iron forms, with unique metal centers located at the sites of nitrogen binding and reduction. Mo-nitrogenase is by far the most extensively characterized one, containing of two proteins: dinitrogenase (MoFe protein) and dinitrogenase reductase (Fe protein). The dinitrogenase is an α2β2 heterotetramer, which binds four [4Fe–4S] clusters that are organized into two ‘P clusters’ and two FeMo cofactors. The dinitrogenase reductase, responsible for the ATP-dependent electron transfer to the corresponding dinitrogenase, is a dimer of two identical subunits (γ2), and contains a [4Fe–4S] cluster bridging the two subunits. For a detailed explanation of the structure and mechanism of nitrogenase, Peters and Szilagyi (2006) can be essential. The reduction of nitrogen to ammonium, catalyzed by nitrogenase, is a highly endergonic reaction requiring ATP. Two ATP are required for each electron transfer, and thus, 16 ATP in total are required to fix one mole of N2, as shown in Eq. (i). However, in practice, nitrogenase tends to produce more H2 than this equation suggests (Cammack et al., 2001). In the absence of N2, nitrogenase acts as an ATP-powered hydrogenase, producing H2 exclusively (Eq. (ii)) (McKinlay and Harwood, 2010). The “alternative” nitrogenases contain vanadium or iron instead of molybdenum, which are structurally are similar to Mo-containing nitrogenases but have catalytic clusters containing FeVa cofactor or FeFe cofactor, respectively. As shown in Eqs. (iii) and (iv), these alternative nitrogenases favor H2 production, allocating a higher proportion of electrons to the reduction of H+ to H2 when compared to the conventional Mo-nitrogenase (Schneider et al., 1997). Currently, R. palustris CGA009 is the only photosynthetic bacterium known to posses all three nitrogenases. In addition, it was revealed that alternative nitrogenase expression is correlated with severe nitrogen starvation conditions (Oda et al., 2005). (i) Mo-nitrogenase : N 2 + 8 H + + 8 e - + 16 ATP → 2 NH 3 + H 2 + 16 ADP (ii) Absence of N 2 : 8 H + + 8 e - + 4 ATP → 4 H 2 + 4 ADP (iii) V-nitrogenase : N 2 + 12 H + + 12 e - + 24 ATP → 2 NH 3 + 3 H 2 + 24 ADP (iv) Fe-nitrogenase : N 2 + 24 H + + 24 e - + 48 ATP → 2 NH 3 + 9 H 2 + 48 ADP"
6,Biological hydrogen production,"BHP is an exciting new area that utilizes microorganisms that freely and efficiently produce H2 as a by-product during metabolism. Solar energy or electrons contained in organics or inorganics can be converted to H2 (McKinlay and Harwood, 2010). Microbes produce H2 for two principal purposes. The first is to dispose of excess reducing equivalents during fermentative metabolism that is either carried out in a dark anaerobic process or associated with the anoxic photosynthetic activity. Second, H2 is a by-product of the action of nitrogenase, the enzyme that is necessary for N2 fixation. As shown in Fig. 3 , BHP can be largely split into photo-driven and dark process depending on light energy requirement. It can then be further classified according to the feedstock sources."
7,Direct biophotolysis,"4.1 Direct biophotolysis Green algae and cyanobacteria directly decompose water into H2 and O2 with the help of light, as shown in Eq. (v). This is the simplest reaction, requiring only water and light, and it emits no greenhouse gases. Thus, it is considered as man’s ultimate H2 producing method (Zaborsky, 1998). However, organisms in nature examined so far have shown rather low rates of H2 production due to the complicated reaction system needed to overcome the large amount of free energy (+237kJ/mol H2). (v) 2 H 2 O → Light energy 2 H 2 + O 2 Δ G = 237 kJ Two photosynthetic systems are involved in this process: photo system I (PS I) and photo system II (PS II). In PS II, photons derived from light energy splits water into O2 and electrons (Fig. 4 ). The electrons are then activated in PS I, which will reduce ferredoxin (Fd). By the activity of hydrogenases, Fd(red) can be reoxidized, forming H2 (Das et al., 2008). [FeFe]-hydrogenase and nitrogenase mediate this reaction in algae and cyanobacteria, respectively. Otherwise, Fd(red) can donate electrons to NAD or NADP, which are subsequently re-oxidized by Group II [NiFe]-hydrogenase in cyanobacteria, also forming H2. As mentioned above, direct biophotolysis has many attractive points, but a central challenge is the suppression of hydrogenase and nitrogenase by byproduct O2 (McKinlay and Harwood, 2010)."
8,Indirect biophotolysis,"4.2 Indirect biophotolysis Extensive research has focused on decreasing hydrogenase O2-sensitivity, but mostly via indirect biophotolysis, in which H2 production is spatially or temporally separated from photosynthesis (Turner et al., 2008). In this process, compounds such as starch and glycogen accumulated during CO2 fixation are degraded to produce H2 by an anaerobic fermentation process (Fig. 4). This can proceed in the dark or in the light condition with cells that have impaired O2-evolving PS II. The spatial separation in this process refers to H2 production by nitrogenase in specialized cyanobacterial cells known as heterocysts, which maintain low O2 concentrations (Sakurai and Masukawa, 2008). Many types of green algae and cyanobacteria, besides having the ability to fix CO2 via photosynthesis, also have the ability to fix N2 from the atmosphere and produce enzymes that can catalyze the anaerobic fermentation process. The most intensively studied form of indirect biophotolysis is to grow Chlamydomonas reinhardtii photosynthetically and then switch the cells into a sulfur-limiting medium to decrease PS II activity (Melis, 2007; Oncel and Vardar-Sukan, 2009). In sulfur-limiting conditions, the water-splitting reaction producing O2 is suppressed while respiration proceeds at a high rate, thereby maintaining a low O2 concentration and allowing for H2 production."
9,Photo-fermentation,"4.3 Photo-fermentation Photo-fermentation bacteria obtain electrons from organics (acetate, butyrate, lactate, etc.) or inorganics ( S 2 O 3 2 - , H2S, Fe2+, etc.) (McKinlay and Harwood, 2010). Purple non-sulfur (PNS) bacteria are the most intensively studied species. They are not equipped with PS II, and hence cannot split water (Golomysova et al., 2010). Therefore, the difficulties associated with O2 inhibition are automatically eliminated. As shown in Fig. 5 , the substrate is oxidized during the TCA cycle, producing H+, CO2, and electrons. via consecutive electron transfer reactions (oxidation/reduction of NAD and Fd), the obtained electrons are finally released as H2 by nitrogenase (Koku et al., 2002). The ATP requirement for the nitrogenase activity is accomplished by light energy conversion in PS I or by the proton gradient developed during the electron transport. Uptake hydrogenase splits H2 into H+ and electrons which are then transferred to the quinine pool regenerating proton motive force and finally obtaining ATP. Therefore, the net amount of H2 production is the amount of H2 produced by nitrogenase minus that consumed by the uptake hydrogenase process. Photo-fermentation is a process that can theoretically achieve maximum H2 yield. Given that it can be applied to various types of organic substrates, it can be combined with wastewater treatment processes. However, this process consumes a considerable amount of energy, and more than 30% of the electrons is contributed to biomass growth (Honda et al., 2006). It also requires a nitrogen-limiting environment, but generally, actual waste contains nitrogen above the concentration that hinders H2 producing mechanism. Moreover, the final H2 yield can be reduced by the uptake hydrogenase activity (Kars and Gunduz, 2010)."
10,Dark fermentation,"4.4 Dark fermentation Fermentative bacteria such as Enterobacter sp., Bacillus sp., and Clostridium sp. are capable of producing H2 from carbohydrate-rich substrates in a dark environment. However, most of the studies have been focused on Clostridium sp. because the highest H2 yield (1.61–2.36molH2/mol glucose) was found for them and they are abundant in natural environments (Hawkes et al., 2002). The main advantage of this process is its fast H2 production rate. The highest H2 production rate ever documented was 15LH2/L-reactor/h, which is more than 100 times higher than those in photo-driven processes (Wu et al., 2005). In addition, problematic wastes including food waste, sewage sludge, and lignocellulosic waste have been successfully applied for dark fermentation (Kim et al., 2004; Ren et al., 2009). As a result, it addressed two crucial world issues simultaneously, a supply of energy and environmental protection. As shown in Fig. 6 , Clostridium sp. have diverse liquid metabolites. While some metabolites (acetate and butyrate) are related to H2 production, others are not. Four moles of electrons obtained from glycolysis reduce two moles of NAD+. Four moles of Fd2+ are reduced to four moles of Fd+ in the next step. As the H2 production by dark fermentation is one means of releasing electrons, four moles of H2 are generated in acetate production following Eqs. (vi) and (vii) because there is no further consumption of NADH and Fd. Two enzymes, NADH-Fd oxidoreductase and [FeFe]-hydrogenase, work in these reactions and their activity are influenced by environmental conditions such as pH, cell growth rate, and H2 partial pressure. Meanwhile, two moles of H2 are generated during butyrate production due to NADH reoxidization in a subsequent step. Although more ATP can be obtained during acetate production, as shown in Fig. 6, butyrate is the main metabolic product of Clostridium sp., because reaction (vi) involves an unfavorable redox change and requires acetyl-CoA as an activator (Bahl and Durre, 2001). In addition, acetate production results in a net generation of NADH which clearly must be rapidly re-oxidized to allow glycolysis to proceed (Jones and Woods, 1986). (vi) NADH + H + + 2 Fd 2 + → NADH-Fd oxidoreductase NAD + + 2 Fd + + 2 H + (vii) 2 Fd + + 2 H + → [FeFe]-hydrogenase + 2 Fd 2 + + H 2 ↑ According to Levin et al. (2004), H2 production by dark fermentation is considered the most practically applicable process. However, a fermentative H2 production alone can only convert, even in an optimal condition, less than 33% of the substrate, and hence second step process should be combined. The three possible known processes are methane fermentation, photofermentation, and microbial fuel cell (MFC). More H2 yield can be achieved in the “dark+photo fermentation process”, but this system is still in its infancy and deserves much further study. In addition, the negligible H2 production from protein and lipid substances also remains as an obstacle (Lay et al., 2003)."
11,CO gas fermentation,"4.5 CO gas fermentation The interest in CO gas fermentation lies in the shifting of the synthesis gas, derived from the gasification of carbon-rich materials, to produce more H2 in favor of CO. Biological processes, although generally slower than chemical reactions, have several advantages over chemical-catalytic processes, such as higher specificity, higher yields, lower energy costs, and generally greater resistance to poisoning (Bredwell et al., 1999). The metabolic pathway of CO gas fermentation is still not clear, but it was frequently stated that carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) is a major contributor to this. In addition to the CODH enzyme, there are at least two other proteins involved in the oxidation of CO to H2: a ferredoxin-like cofactor (Fe–S protein) and a terminal hydrogenase that evolves hydrogenase at a high rate. CODH is responsible for the oxidation of CO to yield CO2 and reducing equivalents. The latter are then transferred, via the Fe–S protein cofactor, to a hydrogenase to produce H2 (Klasson et al., 1992). The oxidation and reduction of ferredoxin are carried out in two consecutive reactions resulting in H2 production. The oxidation of CO in an anaerobic process with Fd is shown in Eqs. (viii), (ix), (x) below: (viii) CO + H 2 O + 2 Fd 2 + → CO 2 + 2 Fd + + 2 H + + 2 e - (ix) 2 H + + 2 Fd + + 2 e - → H 2 + 2 Fd 2 + Overall: (x) CO + H 2 O → H 2 + CO 2 , Δ G = - 20 kJ / mol The CO oxidation system by photosynthetic bacteria has several limitations: (1) it is highly sensitive to O2, (2) the bacteria grow very slowly when CO was provided as the sole carbon source in the light, and (3) it requires an organic substrate to yield consistent growth in light. However, the most significant problem is gas–liquid mass transfer problem (Cowger et al., 1992; Bredwell et al., 1999). The solubilities of CO and H2 are only 60% and 4% of that of O2, respectively (on a mass basis). The reactants, present in the gas phase, must be transported across the gas–liquid interface and diffuse through the culture medium to the cell surface to be consumed by the microbes. As there is a limitation to increase the mass transfer in completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR), columnar reactors, such as trickle-bed reactors and airlift reactors have been developed."
12,Genetic engineering of hydrogenase for the improved H2 production,"Genetic and metabolic modification of the enzymes, hydrogenase and nitrogenase, to optimize the flow of reducing equivalents to enzymes by redirecting the electron paths can be a very promising strategy to achieve a satisfactory amount of H2 from water or organic substances. In this section, the deletion of the gene for H2-uptake hydrogenase, the insertion of a gene for enzyme expression such as an over-expression or an increase the efficiency of H2 producing enzymes in cells, and increasing the O2 tolerance of hydrogenase will be discussed."
13,Elimination of uptake hydrogenase,"5.1 Elimination of uptake hydrogenase The elimination of uptake hydrogenase, which re-oxidizes the produced H2, is the main concern to achieve a satisfactory amount of H2. In many studies, mutants deficient in genes for uptake hydrogenases showed an increased production of H2 and H2 production rate (Ozturk et al., 2006; Kars et al., 2008). N2-fixing cyanobacteria possess two distinct [NiFe]-hydrogenases: an uptake and a reversible (or called bidirectional) enzyme while the non-N2-fixing one has only a reversible hydrogenase. The uptake hydrogenase (encoded by hup) catalyzes the consumption of the H2 produced during N2 fixation, and the reversible enzyme (hox) most likely plays a role in fermentation and/or acts as an electron “valve” during photosynthesis (Houchins, 1984). Hup occurs predominantly in heterocysts and reabsorbs some of the H2 that is produced, while Hox is present in both vegetative cells and heterocysts. One of the major obstacles to efficient H2 generation in cyanobacteria may be the presence of hydrogenases (Hup and/or Hox) that reabsorb the H2 produced by nitrogenase. Mutants produced by chemical mutagenesis or by the deletion of hup gene of the cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis produced significantly higher amounts of H2 than the wild-type (Mikheeva et al., 1995; Happe et al., 2000b). In the hup deletion mutant, gene inactivation led to a slight decrease in nitrogenase activity as measured by acetylene reduction. The effects of Hox deletion on H2 production were also reported by Masukawa et al. (2002) using three mutants from the heterocystous N2-fixing cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 with deletion of either one or both hydrogenases. The hupL (H2-uptake hydrogenase large subunit) disruption mutant produced H2 by 4- to 7-folds faster than that observed in the wild-type without negative effects on nitrogenase activities; however, inactivation of hox did not lead to a further improvement in H2 production. Synthesis of the Hup of Rhodobacter capsulatus is activated in the presence of H2 produced by nitrogenase (Colbeau and Vignais, 1992). Evidence of the molecular link to coregulate nitrogenase and hydrogenase biosynthesis in R. capsulatus has been reported by several researchers in which Reg A, a response regulator, acts not only as a coactivator of gene coding nitrogenase but also directly represses the hydrogenase gene operon; this repression is relieved by H2 (Leclere et al., 1988; Elsen et al., 2000). Based on this aspect, the approach to improve nitrogenase-dependent H2 photo-production is the inactivation of the putative competing H2 uptake activity. In Rhodobacter sphaeroides, mutations in hupSL (H2-uptake hydrogenase small and large subunits) had no effect on the nitrogenase activity. Accordingly, H2 uptake by hydrogenase, monitored by measuring the difference in H2 accumulation between a hupSL-deletion mutant and the wild-type strain, appeared to reach a maximum level (Lee et al., 2002). Another study showed that the use of a suicide vector for the site-directed mutagenesis of hupSL also increased H2 production significantly compared to the corresponding parental strain (Gokhan et al., 2008). Inactivation of all hydrogenases, including all uptake activities, in Thiocapsa roseopersicina (hypF-deficient mutant) under a N2-fixing condition, caused a significant increase in the H2 evolution capacity (Fodor et al., 2001). Ruiyan et al. (2006) also reported that a R. rubrum mutant deleted of hupL encoding the large subunit of the uptake hydrogenase produced an increased amount of H2. To date significant research has been performed to inhibit the uptake hydrogenase activity using different approaches (Kars and Gunduz, 2010)."
14,Genetic insertion of an enzyme to facilitate hydrogenase /nitrogenase,"5.2 Genetic insertion of an enzyme to facilitate hydrogenase /nitrogenase 5.2.1 Over-expression of hydrogenase/nitrogenase The functional [FeFe]-hydrogenase from the strict anaerobe bacterium Clostridium pasteurianum was expressed in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. to investigate the possibility of improving the H2-producing capacity of a photosynthetic microorganism. The Synechococcus mutant demonstrated the possibility of introducing a foreign hydrogenase into the other species of microorganisms, resulting in a significantly increased H2 production capacity. In addition to the nitrogenase-mediated photo-heterotrophic H2 production, Rhodospirillum rubrum produces H2 by formate–hydrogen lyase complexation in the dark; therefore, this strain produces H2 by nitrogenase and hydrogenase. R. rubrum, containing recombinant pRK415 with an insert of hydC coding for its own [FeFe]-hydrogenase, showed twice the accumulation of H2 in the presence of pyruvate under photoheterotrophic conditions, which was not observed in the absence of pyruvate. The same was true with R. rubrum containing recombinant pRK415 cloned with hydA coding for the Fe-only hydrogenase of C. acetobutylicum (Kim et al., 2008b). Furthermore, in order to render R. sphaeroides to produce H2 fermentatively as well, a 4.4-kb R. rubrum DNA encompassing a gene coding for pyruvate-formate lyase (PFL) with its putative maturation protein and a 29.4-kb R. rubrum gene cluster including formate-hydrogen lyase (FHL) complex, its maturation proteins, a transcriptional activator for FHL, and Fe-only hydrogenase with its maturation proteins were cloned and mobilized into R. sphaeroides. The recombinant R. sphaeroides evolved H2 during dark fermentative growth (Kim et al., 2008a). 5.2.2 Increasing the efficiency of hydrogenase/nitrogenase Ammonium, the salts of which are frequently used as nitrogen sources in the cultivation of PNS bacteria, is the second inhibitor of concern. It represses the synthesis of nitrogenase and inhibits nitrogenase activity (Koku et al., 2002). Efficiency of the enzymes is another important factor affecting the rate of hydrogen photo-production. In photosynthetic bacteria, net hydrogen production can be increased by improving the efficiency of nitrogenase. By knocking out glnB and glnK, genes encoding PII-like proteins, the problem of repression of nitrogenase by ammonium ions was overcome in R. sphaeroides (Kim et al., 2008b). Redirection of the electron flux from CO2 uptake in Calvin cycle to the NAD(P)-dependent [NiFe]-hydrogenase contributed to a sustained rate of hydrogenase-mediated H2 production in a mutant M55 of Syncechocystis PCC 6803, which lacks the NADPH-dehydrogenase. This strategy produces only low amounts of O2 during the PS II and shows a poor capacity to fix CO2. NADPH, therefore, was accumulated in the mutant cells, which could redirect electron flux to the hydrogenase (Cournac et al., 2004)."
15,Oxygen tolerance of hydrogenase,"5.3 Oxygen tolerance of hydrogenase Significant research has been conducted in an effort to increase the O2 tolerance of H2 producing enzymes, especially hydrogenases in a cyanobacterial system, by transferring the gene for O2-tolerant NiFe-hydrogenase from Thiocapsa roseopersicina into cyanobacteria (Xu et al., 2005). Sulfur-deprived Chlamydomonas reinharditti double mutant L159I-N230Y, which carries a double amino acids substitution, exhibited the maximum rate of H2 production over 10h during photosynthesis. Because O2 sensitivity is apparently linked to photosynthetic H2 production, this mutant achieves an increase in the O2 tolerance of the mutant strain. The features of this new mutant, compared to the wild-type, were a higher photosynthetic capacity and a high quantum yield of photosynthesis (Torzillo et al., 2009). Lee and Greenbaum (2003) discovered a new competitive pathway for O2 sensitivity in C. reinharditti H2 production by CO2 fixation, which can be inhibited if ATP requirements are not fulfilled. Genetic insertion of a polypeptide protein channel with a hydrogenase promoter into this strain can reduce the proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane by avoiding the ATPase channel in which ATP is produced during the proton transfer activity in algal cells. To improve the H2 production from water or organic materials using microorganisms, the contribution of the genetic engineering of enzymes responsible for H2 production may be required to increase the efficiency of H2 evolution. Further increases are expected by maximizing the H2 production rate, in technical aspects, from the optimization of the biotechnology of the process."
16,Application of hydrogenase in other fields,"Although the research on the employment of hydrogenases has mostly concentrated on the production of H2, their applications were not limited only to this. Hydrogenases have been used as an electrocatalyst, in bioremediation, and for the synthesis of fine chemicals. Hydrogenase from Thiocapsa roseopersicina has drawn much interest due to its high H2 production activity and stability to denaturing factors such as O2 and temperature (Kim et al., 2008c). The enzyme has also shown a stable H2 production capability under in vitro conditions for many days. Application of this enzyme to an electrode in combination with electron donors and carriers to produce the H2 in vitro systems and in two-compartment fuel cells revealed that O2-tolerant hydrogenase can be considered as having high potential for bio-electrocatalytic use (Kim et al., 2008c; Oh et al., 2008). Karyakin et al. (2002) immobilized the hydrogenases of Th. roseopersicina onto carbon electrodes to tunnel electrons between the enzyme and the electrode. The performance of hydrogenase-based electrodes was comparable to those of commercial H2 fuel electrodes; moreover, the former showed much higher tolerance to fuel impurities. H2 derived from hydrocarbons or alcohols via steam reforming or partial oxidation normally contains from 1.0% to 2.5% of CO, which significantly poisons platinum surfaces (Murthy et al., 2001). It was reported that hydrogenases from sulfate-reducing bacteria can act as reductase that converts Cr(VI), which is toxic and soluble to less toxic and insoluble Cr(III). According to Chardin et al. (2003), the [Fe]-hydrogenase from the Desulfovibrio vulgaris strain has high Cr(VI) reducing ability, and its reaction was directly correlated with the H2 consumption rate. In addition, hydrogenases have the potential to reduce halogenated pollutants such as tetrachloroethene (PCE) to less chlorinated ethens (Cammack et al., 2001). NADPH is the cofactor that is required for the production of various types of oxidoreductase, and its formation can be catalyzed by hydrogenases. The generation of NADPH was attempted using hydrogenases from Pyrococcus furiosus in both a batch and continuous mode (Greiner et al., 2003; Mertens et al., 2003)."
17,Concluding remarks,"The future ambit of an environmentally sustainable society will likely depend upon the development of BHP technologies. As it draws upon natural sunlight and water as well as abundant biomass, H2 promises remarkable potential for resolving pressing global challenges, not least because it represents a nearly infinite alternative energy source. Yet, challenges for researchers remain. By way of outlining existing developments of BHP, this study prompts researchers to, as Isaac Newton famously recommended, stand on the shoulders of giants and innovate. For example, the genetic engineering of hydrogenase for enhancing its stability and level of performance is a critical issue at hand as is the isolation of novel H2 producers. The imperative to improve technical aspects such as photo-bioreactors and the integration of processes of BHP also opens avenues along which careful and committed research may expand."
