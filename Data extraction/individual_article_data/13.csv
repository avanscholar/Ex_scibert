0,Introduction,"As a low-carbon clean energy, hydrogen energy overcomes the limitations of fossil fuel energy regarding environmental pollution, making it an ideal energy (Fajrina and Tahir, 2019). Visible-light hydrogen production technology has attracted much attention owing to its advantages, including effective utilization of solar energy and photocatalyst stability (Tang et al., 2019). Sacrificial agents play a key role in hydrogen production, with commonly used including triethanolamine (TEOA), methanol, ethanolamine, Na2SO3, and Na2S (Ong et al., 2016; Li et al., 2003; Natarajan et al., 2015). However, the addition of artificial increased the cost of hydrogen production and also the environmental pollution was very serious (Bao et al., 2021). Synergetic catalysis between pollutants and hydrogen production has recently been studied to realize efficient wastewater utilization (Li et al., 2018; Wei et al., 2020a). For example, dye wastewater (Wang et al., 2019; Vaiano and Lervolino, 2019), antibiotic wastewater (Wei et al., 2020b) have been studied in synergistic catalysis for hydrogen production. The chemical properties of sacrifice agents could be concluded that their surface not only contains negative charge, but is also closely related to the hydroxyl groups (Zhu et al., 2019). Alcohols, the representative compounds that are alkaline and have hydroxyl groups, although they are weakly alkaline. And in many literatures on hydrogen generation from wastewater, the influence mechanism of pollutants on hydrogen production has not been deeply explored (Zhou et al., 2019a; Patsoura et al., 2007). The alcohols like ethanol had been used as sacrificial agents, but the H2-producing activity was reduced compared with TEOA. Therefore, a series of organic alcohols including methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol and polyethylene glycol were selected as sacrificial agents. And the influence of various alcohol sacrificial agents on hydrogen production performance was explored through photoelectrochemical test, in the hope of providing theoretical guidance for further H2-producing from wastewater. High efficiency photocatalytic hydrogen production has higher requirements for photocatalysts. g-C3N4 has often been used as a nonmetal photocatalyst for hydrogen production, but is restricted by a high photogenerated carrier recombination rate and unsatisfactory photocatalytic performance (Zhang et al., 2020a, 2021). To obtain a desirable photocatalyst, many modified methods had been used, including element or quantum dot doping (Qin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2015), Z-type dual-system construction (Xu et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019a; Li et al., 2019a), photosensitization (Liu et al., 2019b), and interface modification strategy (Tian et al., 2021). For example, P-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets with a large pore structure were synthesized by P doping and heat treatment (Ran et al., 2015). Sulfur doping can change the structure, optical and electronic properties, and photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 semiconductors (Zhang et al., 2011). Experiments have shown that S doping can not only narrow the g-C3N4 band gap, but also change the conduction band position (Liu et al., 2010). To make g-C3N4 an economically viable photocatalyst for water splitting, the photodeposition of noble metal cocatalysts, such as Pt (Liu et al., 2019c; Mao et al., 2017) or compounds of Ag, Pt and Pd (Bhunia et al., 2019; Zou et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021), onto this semiconductor has been necessary. Furthermore, various inexpensive and abundant non-noble metal cocatalysts have been prepared, including transition metals (such as Ni, Co, and Cu) (Bi et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016), their oxides and sulfides (such as NiOx, CuO, NiSx, and MoS2) (Lakhera et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2018a; Qi et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2017), and polymetallic phosphates and sulfides (such as NiCoP and CuInS2) (Ma et al., 2020; Luo et al., 2020). The high hydrogen activity of g-C3N4 modified with NiS2 and WS2 was attributed to H+ capture by S2 2− as an interfacial reaction site, with metal sulfides as cocatalysts proven to have certain advantages in hydrogen production (Li et al., 2019b; Zhou et al., 2019b). For photocatalytic reactions, increasing the transfer of photogenerated charge to the surface improves the light utilization rate (Fan et al., 2012). And among non-noble metals, cobalt (5.0 eV) has a higher work function, which can promote the transfer of g-C3N4 photogenerated electrons (Bi et al., 2015; Hong et al., 2013). So the compounds of S2 2− and Co can obviously promote the photocatalytic hydrogen production in theory. Moreover, as a narrow bandgap semiconductor, the CoS2 has became a research hotspot recently. It not only had the strong absorption in visible light, but also showed a good electrochemical properties and had been gradually synthesized and applied in the study of photocatalytic hydrogen production, photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) and electrochemical properties of hybrid asymmetric supercapacitor (Zhang et al., 2020b; Wang et al., 2020; Vinoth et al., 2021). However, the carrier separation efficiency and electron transfer mechanism of CoS2 for g-C3N4 have not been clarified. So systematic study of the charge characteristics of materials and different hydrogen-producing systems, and detailed discussion of the internal relationship between efficient charge characteristics and photocatalytic activity, are important. Therefore, this study aimed to synthesize photocatalytic composite material CoS2@SCN to effectively promote water splitting. Thermal oxidation etching was used to reduce the charge transfer distance, S doping was used to improve optical performance, and electron transfer and hydrogen generation reactions were promoted by synthesis with CoS2 in situ. The relationships between material structure and catalytic activity, between catalytic system with different sacrificial agents and effective charge, were clarified by exploring characteristics including optical performance, photogenerated charge, and structure, to provide a theoretical basis for the further modification of photocatalytic materials and cooperative catalysis."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Preparation of materials,"2.1 Preparation of materials 2.1.1 Preparation of g-C3N4, CN and SCN All the chemicals were of analytical grade and provided by McLean reagent. g-C3N4, CN, and SCN were mainly synthesized by high-temperature polycondensation (Zhang et al., 2020a, b; Zhang et al., 2011). Melamine (2 g) and urea (2 g) were placed in a semi-covered crucible and calcined at 520 °C for 2 h in a muffle furnace at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1. After cooling, the product was ground into a yellow powder (g-C3N4) and further calcined at 600 °C for 2 h (thermal oxidation etching) to obtain two-dimensional (2D) g-C3N4 (CN) with a thin-layer structure. S-doped 2D g-C3N4 (SCN) was synthesized as described above by adding the appropriate amount of thiourea (mass ratios of thiourea to melamine and urea of 1:2, 1:1, and 2:1). 2.1.2 Preparation of CoS2@SCN The synthetic route of composite CoS2@SCN is shown in Scheme S1 (Zhao et al., 2020). SCN powder (500 mg) and CoCl2·6H2O (Co mass ratios of 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 wt% relative to SCN) were dispersed in deionized water (40 mL, containing 50% ethanol) for 2 h. Thioacetamide (TAA) was then added (2 equiv. Relative to CoCl2·6H2O). After continuous stirring for 10 h, the mixture was dried by rotary evaporation. After drying, the product was placed into a tube furnace and annealed at 350 °C under an Ar atmosphere with the annealing rate of 5 °C min−1 for 2 h to grow CoS2 on SCN in situ."
3,Physicochemical analysis,"2.2 Physicochemical analysis The crystal morphology of the catalysts was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD; Bruker D8, Germany) with a scanning range of 10–80°. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM; SU8010, Hitachi, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL-2100, electronics Co., Japan) were used to observe the morphology and nanostructure of the materials. The pore structure and specific surface area were analyzed using a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analyzer (SSA-7000). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; PHI5300, Perkin-Elmer PHI, USA) and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (Vertex 70049, Bruker, Germany) were used to characterize the elements and their chemical bonding, with an FT-IR scanning range of 400–4000 cm−1. Photoabsorption and photoluminescence (PL) properties were analyzed by UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–Vis-DRS) (UV-2600, Shimadzu, Japan) and fluorescence spectrophotometry (F-7000, Hitachi, Japan)."
4,Photocatalytic experiments,"2.3 Photocatalytic experiments Photocatalyzed hydrogen production experiments were performed using photochemical reaction apparatus. Catalyst (50 mg) and the different sacrificial agents solutions (30 mL) were added to a quartz tube, bubbled with N2 for 30 min (to remove oxygen from the solution), and then blocked with a turnover stopper. The types and concentrations of the sacrificial agent are 10 vol% TEOA and the equimolar amount of organic alcohol, including methanol, ethanol, ethyleneglycol, and polyethylene glycol. The quartz tube was then placed into the photochemical reactor, and the Xe lamp (500 W, λ > 420 nm) and magnetic agitator were switched on to start the photocatalytic reaction. The reaction time interval was 1 h, and the percentage of hydrogen in the quartz tube was detected by gas chromatography (TCD detector, N2 carrier gas, Agilent 7890B system, 5 Å molecular sieves)."
5,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements A CHI-600d electrochemical workstation and Xe lamp photoelectrocchemical testing system (CEL-PECX2000, 300-W Xe lamp with 420-nm cutoff filter) were used for photochemical tests. A standard three-electrode system under visible light and with Na2SO4 as the electrolyte (0.1 M) was used for these tests. The synthesized sample coated on F-doped SnO2-coated (FTO) glass was used as the working electrode, platinum wire as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode. The frequency range of EIS was 0.1–106 Hz with a voltage amplitude of 5.0 mV. The frequencies of Mott-Schottky tests were 200, 500, and 1000 Hz, and the test potential was −1.2 to 1.2 V. The photocurrent test interval was 25 s, with five cycles performed at the test voltage of 0 V. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve measured the potential from 0 to 1.25 V and the scanning rate was 0.05 V s−1."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Hydrogen production performance in different catalytic system,"3.1 Hydrogen production performance in different catalytic system 3.1.1 Optimization of catalytic performance Photoelectrochemical tests were used to evaluate the effects of elemental S and CoS2 contents on the catalytic performance of CoS2@SCN, with the results shown in Fig. S1. Fig. S1a and S1b show charge transfer impedance and photocurrent tests corresponding to SCN with different elemental S contents. When the contents ratio of S and g-C3N4 precursor were 1:1, the transfer resistance of photogenerated charge in the bulk phase was minimal and the photocurrent density was the best. The excellent catalytic performance of this material was also proven by its light absorption property and PL characteristics (Fig. S1c and S1d). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. S2a and S2b CoS2 loading of 2.5% gave worse visible absorption property compared with 5% and 10% CoS2@SCN, but an improved charge separation rate. This might be due to 5% and 10% CoS2@SCN mainly exhibited the color of black CoS2, which was darker than 2.5% CoS2@SCN, resulting in better light absorption property. However, as too high a CoS2 load did not promote electron transfer, 2.5% CoS2@SCN showed the best catalytic performance. Fig. S2c shows the EIS Nyquist spectra of 1, 2.5, 5, and 10% CoS2@SCN and its control catalysts 2.5% CoS2@CN and CoS2. The EIS circle radius was largest for 2.5% CoS2@CN, 1% and 5% CoS2@SCN, indicating that the charge transfer was most difficult. And 2.5% CoS2@SCN showed a relatively good charge transfer and separation ability. As shown by the photocurrent test in Fig. S2d, CoS2 (2.5% content) significantly promoted charge transfer in SCN and maintained the maximum photocurrent density. To simplify, the following mechanism analysis and tests used only the best performing 1:1 SCN and 2.5% CoS2@SCN, denoted as SCN and CoS2@SCN. 3.1.2 Hydrogen production performance of CoS2@SCN The catalytic performance of SCN was less than CoS2@SCN, which has been proved by the above test results such as light absorption, EIS and LSV. Fig. 1 a shows the results of activity tests for the photocatalytic decomposition of water using CoS2@SCN with different cocatalyst contents, with TEOA used as the sacrificial agent. 2.5% CoS2@SCN showed excellent hydrogen production activity, with an average hydrogen production rate of 223.6 μmol g−1 h−1. The photocatalytic performance comparison of CoS2@SCN with other non-noble metal cocatalysts system was shown in Table S1 and the CoS2@SCN exhibited relatively better. Fig. 1b shows when the sacrificial agent was methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, and polyethylene glycol, the hydrogen production activity significantly decreased, with ethylene glycol resulting in the highest hydrogen production activity of only 123.2 μmol g−1 h−1, indicating that these alcohols had inferior hole-capture abilities compared with TEOA."
8,Optical properties and charge transfer efficiency,"3.2 Optical properties and charge transfer efficiency 3.2.1 Photo-generated charge behavior of materials As shown in Fig. 2 a, thermal oxidation etching and doping with elemental S had a small enhancing effect on the visible-light-absorption capacity of g-C3N4, while loading with CoS2 clearly enhanced the visible-light-absorption capabilities of SCN. The absorption range was significantly redshifted and maintained a stable absorption capacity in the visible-light range. The photocurrents of g-C3N4, CN, SCN, and CoS2@SCN at different monochromatic wavelengths were obtained using I-t tests, with the results shown in Fig. S3. Then, the photocurrents at each wavelength were calculated, with their relationship with wavelength shown in Fig. 2b. In the visible light range, the photocurrent showed the same trend as the light absorption, which proved that the catalysts with stronger visible light absorption resulted in more charges being excited, and had a greater ability to convert it into photocurrent. It was interesting to find that the catalysts exhibited high photocurrent at 500–550 nm and this may be because g-C3N4 nanomaterials were sensitive to the wavelength at 500–550 nm and could maximize the light usage at 500–550 nm to convert light energy into chemical energy with high photocurrent. And Ye et al. also through transient absorption spectroscopy studied the carrier dynamics of g-C3N4 and proved that g-C3N4 may have photogenerated electron absorption signals in the near infrared and infrared regions (Ye et al., 2015). Fig. 2c shows the PL spectra of g-C3N4, CN, SCN, and CoS2@SCN. The fluorescence peak position of g-C3N4 was about 456 nm, and the PL peak intensity of SCN decreased significantly from 1021 to 131 after modification with CoS2. As shown in Fig. 2d, the bandgap widths of g-C3N4, CN, SCN were 2.64, 2.49, 2.48 eV respectively, as obtained using the Kubelka–Munk function (Ran et al., 2015). Furthermore, the band gap width decreased with gradual modification, indicating that the photocatalytic hydrogen generation reaction became easier when less energy was needed for electron transition. And we tested and calculated the light absorption and band gap width of CoS2, as shown in Fig. S4. CoS2 had a strong absorption in the whole wavelength range, and its band gap was almost 0 (Liu et al., 2020). It was considered that CoS2 and SCN formed a Schottky heterojunction, and this composite semiconductor was more consistent with the promotion principle of precious metals Pt for SCN (Xia et al., 2021). To further prove the carrier separation efficiency, EIS Nyquist plots were used to characterize and analyze the catalysts, as shown in Fig. 3 a. These plots showed only an arc, indicating that no resistance diffusion process of the photoelectric charge in solution (Shi et al., 2018b; Kern et al., 2002). Arcs with larger diameters in the high-frequency region indicate that charge transfer at the electrolyte-electrode interface is more difficult. The order of resistance was g-C3N4 > CN > SCN > CoS2@SCN, and so charge transfer capacity was in the order g-C3N4 < CN < SCN < CoS2@SCN. Therefore, modification by thermal oxidation etching, and S and CoS2 loading, all contributed to electron transfer and carrier separation. Furthermore, the impedance data obtained through fitting (Table S2) indicated that CoS2@SCN showed significantly reduced resistance, meaning that CoS2, as a cocatalyst of SCN, played an obvious role in charge transfer and made the largest contribution to carrier separation. The effective lifetime (τeff) of electrons in the photocatalyst conduction band is an important parameter for carrier recombination. Larger τeff result in a smaller interface electron recombination rate, making electron transfer easier. As shown in Fig. 3b, the Bode diagram showed that the modified catalysts had almost no peak in the low frequency region. With the phase value of the peak being much lower than that of the medium-frequency peak, indicating that the modification promoted the separation of charges and holes, and improved the charge transfer efficiency at the interface (Malara et al., 2015). Next, the peak frequency (fmax) was read from the maximum phase angle in the medium frequency region of Bode diagram and then calculated by Eq. (1), where ωmax corresponds to the peak phase angle frequency of the semicircle in the EIS spectrum (Sun et al., 2013; Dong et al., 2013). The τeff of g-C3N4, CN, SCN, and CoS2@SCN were calculated to be 1.9, 3.4, 6.1, and 73.9 ms, respectively (Table S3). This further explained why CoS2@SCN showed an excellent photocatalytic ability. (1) τ e f f = 1 ω m a x = 1 2 π f m a x According to the Mott-Schottky equation (Eq. (2)), where Cbulk is the capacitance of the space charge layer, ε r is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor, ε 0 is the dielectric constant of the vacuum, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, Nd is the carrier concentration, and VE and VFB are the applied voltage and the band potential respectively. The Nd is directly related to the slope corresponding to the linear part of the Mott-Schottky spectrum, with a smaller slope resulting in an Nd value (Zhang et al., 2019; Li et al., 2011; Luo et al., 2010). Therefore, Mott-Schottky tests of various catalysts at different frequencies (200, 500, and 1000 Hz) were conducted as shown in Fig. S5. The slope corresponding to the linear part, as shown in Table S4, clearly showed that the Nd were in the order g-C3N4 < CN < SCN < CoS2@SCN. The increase in Nd showed that modification of the photocatalyst reduced the electron-hole recombination rate and made the catalytic reaction occur more easily. (2) 1 C b u l k 2 = 2 ε 0 ε r e N d A 2 ( ( V E − V F B ) − k T e ) As shown in Fig. 3c, the photocurrent of each catalyst was observed at a voltage of 0 V, with the materials all showing rapid and obvious photocurrent responses when the light was switched on. CoS2@SCN gave a current 5 times higher than that of g-C3N4, which indicated that CoS2@SCN had an increased effective charge quantity and life compared with other catalysts. LSV curves (Fig. 3d) showed that the current density of both CN and SCN were higher compared with that of g-C3N4. When the voltage was 0.6 V, the photocurrent densities of CN and SCN increased to 3.6 and 4.8 μA cm−2, respectively, compared with 1.9 μA cm−2. And, loading with CoS2 significantly enhanced the current density to 76.7 μA cm−2, showing that CoS2 effectively transferred electrons and promoted the catalytic ability. The stability of CoS2@SCN was explored using hydrogen production stability test and photocurrent continuous test (Fig. S6), which maintained a good catalytic performance within the test range. 3.2.2 Effect of various alcohol sacrificial agents on hydrogen evolution As shown in Fig. 4 a, the charge transfer process in the catalytic system with different sacrificial agents was obviously different from that in the Na2SO4 electrolyte system. The radius of the circular arc represented the charge transmission resistance in the bulk phase of the catalyst. The slope of the oblique line corresponding to the low frequency region was related to the photoelectric charge diffusion resistance in solution, and was proportional to the charge diffusion rate in the electrolyte. The resistance values for each part, obtained by fitting the EIS spectrum, were shown in Table S5. Compared with the data in Table S2, the charge transfer resistance values decreased significantly in the presence of various alcohol sacrificial agents. This indicated that, after the hole was captured, the charge transfer ability was increased and the tendency of excited charge to return to the valence band was reduced. In the hydrogen-producing system, except for TEOA, ethylene glycol showed the lowest diffusion resistance, indicating that electrons in the ethylene glycol system were more likely to come into contact with H+ in solution to undergo rapid reaction. As shown in Fig. 4b, the Bode map showed that the peak frequencies in the intermediate frequency region were all 1.778 Hz, indicating that the effective charge lifetime in the catalyst conduction band was 85.9 ms, which was higher than that without sacrificial agent added (73.9 ms). This indicated that the key factor affecting the charge lifetime was carrier separation by the catalyst itself, while the effect of organic alcohols on photoelectric charge was more reflected in the redox reaction on the catalyst surface. Fig. 4c and d shows the photocurrent and photocurrent density of different systems, which were consistent with their hydrogen production performance in the overall trend. TEOA, as the best h+ trapping agent, showed the highest current performance, which was 5 time higher than that without sacrificial agent added. The current density of the organic alcohol system was also enhanced, indicating that the competitive reactions of organic-hole oxidation and e−-h+ complexation would occur in the presence of alcohols, promoting electron separation."
9,Relationship between catalytic efficiency and structure,"3.3 Relationship between catalytic efficiency and structure As shown in Fig. 5 a, g-C3N4, CN, SCN, and CoS2@SCN all had two distinct diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 13.1° and 27.4°, which corresponded to the (100) and (002) crystal planes of g-C3N4 (Zhang et al., 2020a, b; Zhang et al., 2011). It can be seen that there were also standard characteristic peaks at 2θ values of 17.623°, 21.451°, 46.534°, 57.166° and 59.597° (g-C3N4, JCPDS, 87–1526). The Bragg equation and Scherrer formula were used to calculate the layer spacing and normal particle size of (002) the crystal plane, respectively (Table S6). The results showed that CN obtained by thermal oxidation etching had a thinner lamellar structure, with a normal particle size of only 12.1 nm, with the structure of the thin lamellar layer being more conducive to electron transfer to the catalyst surface. Furthermore, in the XRD pattern, crystal faces (200) and (210) appeared at 2θ values of 32.33° and 36.23°, which corresponded to the two characteristic peaks of cubic CoS2 (CoS2, JCPDS, 41–1471) (Zhao et al., 2020). Furthermore, according to Table S7, loading with CoS2 did not change the layer spacing of SCN, but the normal particle size was increased, indicating that cubic cobalt sulfide CoS2 was successfully loaded on the SCN surface. As shown in Fig. 5b, obvious g-C3N4 chemical bonding features were observed at 800, 1200–1700, and 3000-3700 cm−1 in CN, SCN, and CoS2@SCN, respectively (Zhang et al., 2020a, b). The elements and their combined states in the catalysts were further analyzed by XPS, as shown in Fig. S7, 5c, and 5d. Fig. S7a shows the total XPS spectrum of the catalyst, with its element content listed in Table S8, and peak-fitting analysis of elements in samples was conducted. Fig. S7b shows the high-resolution C spectrum, with peaks at 288.4 and 284.8 eV corresponding to N–CN and CC structures. According to Fig. S7c, the N 1s binding energy of 398.5, 399.9, and 405.3 eV corresponded to CN–C, N-(C)3, and C–N–H, respectively (Xu et al., 2020). The binding energy of N-(C)3 shifted to a lower value with loading, which might be related to changes in hole spacing of the triazine ring, while the C–N–H peak migrated to a high binding energy owing to the reduction of free amino groups on the surface. As shown in Fig. 5c, the S 2p spectrum of CoS2@SCN showed an unsaturated disulfide bond peak at 162.2 eV, which was attributed to bridging ligand S2 2−, which can be used as the active site of H2 evolution. The C–S and S–N bond peaks replacing the N and C elements were located at 163.6 and 165.4 eV, respectively. The peak area showed that S mainly entered the lattice of CN by replacing N. The S–O bond was also observed at a binding energy of 168.5 eV, possibly due to SO4 2− formation on the catalyst surface (Zhang et al., 2011; Pan et al., 2017). And we can also see that the S element of SCN only had two peaks, which correspond to the C–S and SO4 2− bond respectively. By comparison, it could be found that the binding energy positions of the S of SCN were shifted after CoS2 was loaded. The spectrum of Co 2p is shown in Fig. 5d, with Co existed in the form of Co2+ combined with S2 2− with binding energies of 780.8 and 795.1 eV corresponding Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, and satellite peaks at the higher binding energy positions of 786.8 and 802.8 eV, respectively (Pan et al., 2017; Tong et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2017). Fig. S8 shows the surface and fine morphology of the catalysts. As shown in Fig. S8b, CN had the structural of a thin layer and had more active sites than g-C3N4, and this was also better explained by the BET in Table S9. The edges of SCN were more incomplete and the surface became uneven (Fig. S8c). CoS2@SCN mainly exhibited the morphology of SCN with no obvious CoS2 particles found. The corresponding EDS element mappings of SCN and CoS2@SCN samples are shown in Fig. S9. Comparing (a), (c), and (e) in the TEM spectra (Fig. 6 ) also showed that the thick block structure of g-C3N4 changed into a thin layer structure after thermal oxidation etching, with the same rule observed at the catalyst edge in Fig. 6b, d, and 6f. The electron diffraction pattern (inset) showed that g-C3N4, CN, and SCN all exhibited amorphous electron diffraction. Fig. 6g showed that the cocatalyst load increased the crystal thickness of SCN, which also promoted contact between CoS2 and SCN, facilitating the transfer of photoexcited charge from SCN. Fig. 6h shows cubic CoS2 nanoparticles formed by the orderly arrangement of numerous cubic crystal cells, in addition to lattice fringes shown on their crystal surfaces. According to the measurement and calculation of the electron diffraction spectrum, the spacing of the crystal plane (200) of CoS2 was 0.277 nm, which was consistent with the XRD calculation (Table S7). The N2 adsorption-desorption diagrams of the catalysts (Fig. S10) showed a type IV adsorption isotherm, while Table S9 showed that the specific surface area of CN was higher than that of g-C3N4 owing to the thermal oxidation etching. Furthermore, that of SCN was less than that of CN, because S was doped into the CN lattice, decreasing the spacing of nitrogen pores. The specific surface area of CoS2@SCN was lower than that of CN and SCN, which might be attributed to CoS2 entering the pores of SCN, occupying the pore volume and reducing the specific surface area of the materials. Fig. S11 shows the surface charge of the catalysts and sacrificial agents. Zeta potential test showed that the CoS2 surface was negatively charged, mainly contributed by the disulfide bond S2 2−, such that CoS2 effectively adsorbed H+ in solution. Sacrificial agents play a key role in the hydrogen production activity in hydrogen production systems. As holes are positively charged, a more electronegative surface charge results in the holes on the catalyst surface being easier to capture, inhibiting carrier recombination. Furthermore, after adding TEOA, the CoS2@SCN surface charge showed a slight negative deviation, which might be due to TEOA adsorption on the catalyst surface. TEOA adsorption mainly consumed holes (h+) on the catalyst surface, which resulted in more effective charge (e−), reducing the positive charge and resulting in the highest hydrogen production activity. As the charges of ethanol and ethylene glycol were shifted in the positive direction, their binding ability for holes became weaker, resulting in decreased hydrogen production activity. Therefore a mechanism was proposed for hydrogen production in the catalytic system with different sacrificial agents using CoS2@SCN. As shown in Fig. 7 , loading with CoS2 as cocatalyst was key to enhancing the photocatalytic capacity. After photoexcitation, electrons and holes were generated in the conduction band and valence band of SCN. These holes could oxidize the organic sacrificial agent adsorbed on the catalyst surface and effectively promote organic matters degradation. Meanwhile, the e−-h+ recombination rate was also reduced. Furthermore, CoS2 promoted electron transfer from SCN to CoS2, with CoS2 being used as an H+ adsorption site, facilitating more effective reduction of H+ to H2 using surface electrons."
10,Conclusions,"A novel preparation method was proposed for g-C3N4 doped with S and non-noble metal cubic CoS2 as cocatalyst, which was applied to water splitting with different sacrificial agent under visible light. Experiments showed that the catalyst had a strong visible light absorption ability with the photocurrent increased 5-fold, and efficient electron transfer ability, with resistance decreased 2490-fold and a long charge life of 73.9 ms. Therefore, CoS2@SCN showed superior performance for hydrogen production. Furthermore, organics with a negative charge were proven to react more easily with holes in the catalytic system. Organics can continue reducing charge transfer resistance (almost 1000-fold) and promote charge diffusion into the solution to promote the hydrogen production activity. This work is expected to provide a new reference and application value for the design of highly active non-noble metal photocatalysts and highly efficient synergistic catalytic hydrogen production systems."
