0,Introduction,"The utilization of abundant CO2, which is released from a variety of industrial processes and can worsen the global environment due to the greenhouse effect, as a carbon feedstock to supply energy and chemicals would contribute to establishing carbon-neural society [1–6]. Among various conversion routes, the hydrogenation of CO2 using renewable energy-derived H2 [7] into high-value multi-carbon (C2+) compounds has received much recent research interest [8–16]. In particular, the synthesis of olefins, including both lower (C2 − C4) and higher (C5+) α-olefins, which are key building-blocks or feedstocks in the current chemical industry for the production of polymers, oxygenates (e.g., alcohols, aldehydes, carboxylic acids and esters), and synthetic lubricants and surfactants [17–19], from CO2 is highly attractive. However, the selective conversion of CO2 to olefins is very challenging. This is not only because of the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of CO2 molecule but also due to the high reactivity of olefins toward hydrogenation. Furthermore, the C − C coupling should be manipulated to avoid the formation of CH4 or too heavier products to control the product selectivity. Thus far, several types of catalysts have been reported for the hydrogenation of CO2 to olefins [13–16,20–42]. Among these catalysts, the metal oxide/zeolite-based bifunctional catalysts [15,16,20–26] and the iron-based catalysts [24,27–42] have shown promising performances for the selective formation of olefins. The metal oxide/zeolite-based bifunctional catalyst, which integrates the hydrogenation of CO2 to CH3OH/dimethyl ether (DME) (eq 1) and CH3OH/DME to olefins (MTO) (eq 2) in tandem, has demonstrated high selectivity of C2 − C4 olefins (≥80%) in hydrocarbons [20–26]. In spite of the high lower olefin selectivity, the activity of this type of catalysts is generally not high because of the limited hydrogenation ability of metal oxides. Moreover, CO is also formed mainly on the metal oxide in parallel to CH3OH/DME via the reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) reaction (eq 3) and the selectivity of CO, which is calculated separately from that of hydrogenated products, is typically > 50% at a CO2 conversion of < 20%. The formation of CO becomes more serious by increasing the CO2 conversion upon increasing the reaction temperature. Thus, the single-pass yield of olefins from CO2 is limited to ~ 7% over most of the bifunctional metal oxide/zeolite catalysts [20–23,25]. Only a very recent study claimed a higher single-pass olefin yield of ~ 16% by controlling the CO selectivity at 26.5% at a considerable CO2 conversion via carefully designing the metal oxide to suppress the RWGS reaction [26]. The space–time yield of olefins, which is an important indicator of activity from the viewpoint of practical applications and is calculated by the weight of C2+ olefins formed per catalyst weight per hour, is also quite limited (typically < 0.15 g gcatal -1h−1) over the metal oxide/zeolite bifunctional catalyst due to the limited activity [20–23,25,26]. On the other hand, the hydrogenation of CO2 to olefins over the Fe-based catalysts is assumed to proceed via the following two steps, i.e., the RWGS reaction for CO2 to CO (eq 3) and the subsequent CO hydrogenation to olefins (eq 4), which is also known as the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to olefins (FTO) [24,27–42]. In other words, the Fe-based catalyst is considered to hold a stronger ability for CO hydrogenation. Thus, the design of catalysts composed of optimized active phases for the RWGS and FTO reactions has the potential to decrease the selectivity of CO and to offer higher yields and formation rates of olefins from CO2. CO2 + H2 → CH3OH → 1/2CH3OCH3 + H2O (1) nCH3OH (n/2 CH3OCH3) → C n H2 n + 1(n/2) H2O (2) CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O (3) nCO + 2nH2 → C n H2 n + nH2O (4) The synthesis of olefins by hydrogenation of CO has also attracted much attention in recent years under the background of utilizing abundant non-petroleum carbon resources such as natural or shale gas, coal and biomass to replace petroleum for the production of chemicals via syngas. Fe-based catalysts are one category of the most intensively studied catalysts for the FTO reaction [43–53], although cobalt carbides and metal oxide/zeolite bifunctional catalysts have recently been demonstrated to be efficient for CO hydrogenation to olefins [15,54–58]. It is proposed that the iron carbides, in particular χ-Fe5C2, formed under the syngas atmosphere functions as the active phase for the activation of CO and C − C coupling [48,52,53]. Heavy modification of Fe catalysts is usually necessary for obtaining high olefin selectivity during CO hydrogenation. The modifier plays an essential role in the Fe-catalyzed hydrogenation of CO2 or CO to olefins. The sole Fe catalyst usually shows limited selectivity of the C − C coupling products due to the formation of CH4 [36]. Alkali metal ions are typically indispensable for the selective formation of olefins over the Fe-based catalysts. It is proposed that the alkali metal ion and several non-metal dopants such as N and S function as electronic promoters to facilitate the activation of CO2 or CO [29–38,40–42,47–51]. The enhanced surface basicity by Na+ or K+ might also contribute to the adsorption of CO2 and the facile desorption of olefin products. In addition, metal oxides have often been exploited to enhance the formation of olefins over Fe-based catalysts. MnO x and ZnO are the most intensively investigated metal oxide promoters [29,34,37,42,48,49]. These metal oxides are proposed to work as structural promoters to help the dispersion of Fe species, thus promoting the conversion of CO2 or CO [29,32,48,53]. The state-of-the-art Fe-based catalysts with different modifiers could achieve olefin selectivity of ~ 75% at a CO2 conversion of ~ 35% with the simultaneous formation of CO with selectivity of ~ 20% (Table S1). The highest space–time yield of olefins is ~ 0.40 g gcat −1h−1. In spite of significant progress, the roles of different modifiers in the hydrogenation of CO2 and CO and the key factors that determine the activity and C2+ olefin selectivity remain under debate. The active phases for the RWGS and the FTO reactions are usually assumed to be Fe3O4 and iron carbides (typically χ-Fe5C2), respectively [33,40,41], formed in situ during the reaction and these phases are entangled with each other, hindering the rational design of efficient tandem catalytic systems for CO2 hydrogenation to C2+ olefins. Further, the Fe-based catalysts that have been reported for the hydrogenation of CO and CO2 to olefins are quite similar, but the comparative studies for the conversions of CO2 and CO to olefins are very scarce [59]. Herein, we report the hydrogenative conversions of CO2 and CO to olefins over the same Fe-based catalyst modified with Na+ and ZnO. The catalyst, which contains χ-Fe5C2 as almost the only iron phase under working conditions, shows high activity and selectivity towards the formation of C2 − C12 olefins by hydrogenation of either CO2 or CO. The single iron phase enables us to disentangle the active phases for the RWGS and FTO reactions and to elucidate the roles of modifiers in controlling the structure of iron species and in modulating the activation of CO2/CO and H2 and the formation of products. We further demonstrate that the proximity between ZnO and χ-Fe5C2 is crucial to CO2 conversion and product selectivity. The hydrogenation of CO2 is compared with that of CO over the same Fe-based catalysts to deepen the understanding of the role of each catalyst component and to offer guidance for the design of efficient catalysts for the synthesis of olefins from either CO2 or CO."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The Na- and Zn-modified Fe (denoted as Na − Zn − Fe) catalyst was synthesized by a sol–gel method. The Fe(NO3)3·9H2O of 5.0 g (12.4 mmol), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O of 3.7 g (12.4 mmol), NaNO3 of 0.084 g (0.1 mmol) and citric acid monohydrate of 5.2 g (24.8 mmol) were dissolved in deionized water of 30 mL, and the mixed aqueous solution was kept at 363 K for 3 h under continuous stirring to obtain a viscous sol. The obtained sol was heated in vacuum to 453 K and then kept at 453 K for 5 h to provide a gel. The gel was calcined in air at 673 K for 4 h. The contents of Na and Zn in the Na − Zn − Fe catalyst were 1.0 and 28 wt%, respectively, unless otherwise stated. The catalysts with different Na and Zn contents were synthesized by the same procedure. Moreover, the Zn-Fe with 28 wt% Zn and Na-Fe with 1 wt% Na catalysts were prepared by the same procedure without addition of NaNO3 and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, respectively. Pure Fe catalyst was obtained by the same procedure without addition of NaNO3 and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, while pure ZnO catalyst was also prepared by the same procedure with only adding the citric acid monohydrate and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O. To investigate the role of each component, we fabricated several model catalysts. A pure-phase χ-Fe5C2 was fabricated by a method of iron carburization [60]. In brief, 0.2 g of pure Fe catalyst, which was preliminarily fabricated by the sol–gel method, was first treated in H2 gas flow (100 mL min−1) in a quartz reactor at 723 K for 2 h, and then the carburization was carried out in a CO-H2 gas mixture with a CO/H2 ratio of 67:33 and flow of 50 mL min−1 at 723 K for 12 h. After the treatment, the reactor was cooled down to room temperature under the pure Ar gas with a flow of 50 mL min−1 to obtain the pure-phase χ-Fe5C2. By this method, a Na-modified χ-Fe5C2 (denoted as Na+−Fe5C2) and a Zn-modified χ-Fe5C2 (denoted as ZnO − Fe5C2) were also fabricated by the same procedure of H2 reduction followed by carburization of 1 wt% Na − Fe and 28 wt% Zn − Fe samples, which were preliminarily prepared by the sol–gel method."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was recorded on a Rigaku Ultima IV instrument using Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 30 mA) as the X-ray source. N2 physisorption was measured at 77 K on a Micromeritics Tristar II 3020 analyzer. Prior to the measurement, the sample was degassed at 573 K for 2 h before N2 adsorption. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurements were performed on a Phillips Analytical FEI Tecnai20 electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The sample was dispersed ultrasonically in ethanol for 5 min and a drop of solution was deposited onto a carbon-coated copper grid. Mössbauer spectroscopy measurements were performed typically at room temperature (293 K) on the MS-500 Mössbauer spectrometer (manufactured by Oxford, UK). The calculated parameters were calibrated with respect to α-Fe. The spectral lines consist of a set of Lorentzian lines fitted by the program according to the non-linear least square method. Phase identification was based on isomer shift (IS), quadrupole splitting (QS) and hyperfine field strength (Hhf) of each Lorentzian line. The relative content of each phase was determined by integrating the absorption peak area of each phase."
4,Catalytic reaction,"2.3 Catalytic reaction The conversions of CO2 and CO were both carried out on a fixed-bed high-pressure reaction device built by Xiamen HanDe Engineering Co., Ltd. Typically, the powdery catalyst (weight: 100 mg, grain sizes: 250–600 µm) diluted with quartz sands (900 mg) was loaded in a titanium reactor (inner diameter: 10 mm). Prior to each catalytic reaction, the catalyst was reduced in situ in the reactor with 5% H2 − N2 gas flow (25 mL min−1) at 673 K for 2 h under atmospheric pressure. After cooling to room temperature, the reactant gas with H2/CO2 ratio of 3:1 or H2/CO ratio of 2:1 was fed into the reactor. The reactant gas contained 4.0% Ar as an internal standard for the calculation of CO2 or CO conversion. The reaction was typically carried out at a pressure of 2.5 MPa and a temperature of 613 K. Products were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph, which was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and two flame ionization detectors (FIDs). A carbon molecular sieve (TDX-01)-packed column connected to TCD was employed for the separation and analyses of H2, Ar, CO, CH4 and CO2, while a RT-Q-BOND-PLOT column and a PONA capillary column connected to FIDs were exploited to separate and analyze the C1 − C12 hydrocarbons and oxygenates. The conversion of CO2 or CO and the product selectivity were calculated on a molar carbon basis. The selectivity of CO in the hydrogenation of CO2 via the RWGS reaction and that of CO2 in the hydrogenation of CO probably via the water–gas shift (WGS) reaction (eq. 5) were calculated separately from those of hydrocarbon products. Typically, the catalytic performance after 10 h of reaction was used for discussion. Carbon balances were all better than 90%. The C3H6 hydrogenation reaction was carried out on a fixed-bed reactor with the feed gas of C3H6, H2 and He. The C3H6 and products were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph, which was equipped with a flame ionization detector. CO + H2O → CO2 + H2 (5)"

6,Efficient catalyst for hydrogenation of CO2 to olefins,"3.1 Efficient catalyst for hydrogenation of CO2 to olefins We first investigated the effects of Na and Zn contents on catalytic behaviors of Fe catalysts for the hydrogenation of CO2 to obtain an efficient catalyst for the formation of C2+ olefins. The sole Fe catalyst exhibited a CO2 conversion of 18% with a 22% selectivity of CO, which arose from the RWGS reaction. The major hydrocarbon products on the sole Fe catalyst were CH4 and C2 − C4 paraffins, and the selectivity of olefins (mainly C2 − C4 olefins) was quite low (5.9%). The addition of 28 wt% Zn into Fe in the absence of Na only slightly increased CO2 conversion and decreased the CO selectivity, and no significant changes in the distribution of hydrocarbon products were observed by incorporating Zn into Fe (Fig. 1 a-b). The addition of Na into the 28 wt% Zn − Fe catalyst significantly increased the conversion of CO2, while the selectivity of CO changed only slightly. The CO2 conversion reached 38% at a Na content of 1.0 wt% and a further increase in Na content did not significantly alter the CO2 conversion (Fig. 1a). More importantly, the addition of Na significantly changed the distribution of hydrocarbon products (Fig. 1b). The selectivity of olefins including not only C2 − C4 but also C5 − C12 olefins increased remarkably on addition of a small amount of Na, whereas the selectivity of CH4 and C2 − C4 paraffins decreased dramatically at the same time. The selectivity of C2 − C12 olefins reached 78% as the Na content rose to 1.0 wt%. The further increase in the Na content up to 15 wt% only slightly altered the product selectivity. We further investigated the effect of Zn content in the presence of 1.0 wt% Na on catalytic behaviors of Fe catalysts. The change in Zn content in a range of 0–64 wt% displayed a maximum CO2 conversion (38%) at a medium Zn content of 28 wt% (Fig. 1c). It is of interest that the selectivity of CO showed a reverse trend to that of the CO2 conversion and was the lowest at the Zn content of 28 wt%. A further increase in the Zn content from 28 to 64 wt% rather increased the CO selectivity from 15% to 29%. The selectivity of olefins kept almost the same upon increasing the Zn content from 0 to 28 wt% and then decreased with a further increase in the Zn content to 64% (Fig. 1d). The increase in Zn content from 28 to 64 wt% promoted the formation of CH4 and C2 − C4 paraffins. Thus, the Na − Zn − Fe catalyst with a Na content of 1.0 wt% and a Zn content of 28 wt% offers the highest yield of C2+ olefins (25%) from CO2. This olefin yield is significantly higher than those obtained over metal oxide/zeolite bifunctional catalysts [20–23,25,26] and is also higher than most of the reported values over Fe-based catalysts (Table S1). The results described above suggest that the modification of Fe catalyst by Zn alone cannot significantly change the product distribution, and CH4 and C2 − C4 paraffins are the major products. The Na modifier is essential to the selective formation of C2 − C12 olefins. The CO2 conversion is also enhanced by the presence of Na modifier, whereas the selectivity of CO is not significantly altered at the same time. The co-presence of Zn modifier with Na with a proper content could improve the CO2 conversion and suppress the formation of CO."
7,Catalytic behaviors of Na − Zn − Fe catalyst for hydrogenation of CO2 and CO,"3.2 Catalytic behaviors of Na − Zn − Fe catalyst for hydrogenation of CO2 and CO We then performed in-depth studies with the Na − Zn − Fe catalyst (contents of Na and Zn = 1.0 and 28 wt%) for the hydrogenative conversions of not only CO2 but also CO under comparable conditions. To ensure that the intrinsic activities are compared, the reactions have been performed at a high gas-hourly space velocity (GHSV, 300000 mL g-1h−1) or a short contact time (0.012 s g mL−1) to keep the CO2 or CO conversion lower than 20%. Upon increasing the temperature from 553 to 643 K, the conversions of CO2 and CO increased from 2.4% to 21% and from 3.7% to 23%, respectively (Table 1 ). At the same reaction temperature in this region, the conversion of CO2 was about 1.3–1.5 times lower than that of CO. The increase in reaction temperature slightly decreased the CO selectivity from 36% to 30% in CO2 hydrogenation but increased the CO2 selectivity from 22% to 32% in CO hydrogenation. Thus, the WGS reaction (eq. 5) is promoted at a higher temperature in CO hydrogenation. It is noteworthy that the selectivity of CO usually increases remarkably with an increase in temperature during CO2 hydrogenation over the metal oxide/zeolite bifunctional catalysts due to the accelerated RWGS reaction at higher temperatures [20–26]. The observation that the CO selectivity decreases on increasing temperature during CO2 conversion (Table 1) suggests that the CO molecule formed by the RWGS reaction may be hydrogenated more facilely at higher temperatures over the present Na − Zn − Fe catalyst. It is of interest that the selectivities of hydrocarbon products are quite similar in the conversions of CO2 and CO, and are dependent slightly on reaction temperature in both cases. Olefins are the major products, and the selectivities of lower (C2 − C4) and higher (C5 − C12) olefins are 39–42% and 33–39%, respectively. A too higher temperature is unfavorable to the selectivity of C2 − C12 olefins due to the increased formation of CH4 and C2+ paraffins. The ratio of olefins to paraffins (O/P) decreased in particular at 643 K. The yields of C2 − C12 olefins were 11% and 12% in the conversions of CO2 and CO, respectively, at 643 K and GHSV of 300000 mL g-1h−1. We further carried out hydrogenative conversions of CO2 and CO at 613 K and a relatively lower GHSV (15000 mL g-1h−1) to increase the single-pass product yield. The conversions of CO2 increased to 38%, while the selectivity of C2 − C12 olefins kept unchanged at 78%, and thus the yield of C2 − C12 olefins increased to 25%, which outperformed most of the Fe-based catalysts reported to date (Table S1). Furthermore, the Na − Zn − Fe catalyst shows high space–time yields of C2+ olefins from CO2; the space–time yield of C2+ olefins reaches 3.4 g gcat −1h−1 at GHSV of 300000 mL g−1h−1 and 613 K. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest space–time yield of C2+ olefins reported in CO2 hydrogenation (Table S1). It is worth mentioning that the conversion of CO increased to 94% upon changing the GHSV to 15000 mL g-1h−1 at 613 K and the selectivity of C2 − C12 olefins kept at 77%, offering a C2 − C12 olefin yield of 51%. Thus, significantly higher CO conversion and C2 − C12 olefin yield could be achieved at longer contact time for CO hydrogenation than for CO2 hydrogenation. We investigated the effect of contact time on catalytic behaviors of the Na − Zn − Fe catalyst for CO2 and CO hydrogenation. The CO2 conversion increased almost proportionally at short contact times (0.00343 to 0.012 s g mL−1) and the increase became almost saturated when the CO2 conversion reached ~ 30% (Fig. 2 a). At a shorter contact time, CO was formed with higher selectivity, and an increase in the contact time decreased the selectivity of CO and increased that of hydrocarbons. This observation supports the idea that the conversion of CO2 proceeds via the RWGS reaction to CO followed by the FT reaction to hydrocarbons (Scheme 1 ). The selectivity of C2 − C12 olefins in hydrocarbons increased slightly from 74% to 78% at short contact times and then kept almost unchanged on further increasing the contact time (Fig. 2b). The CO conversion was also proportional to the contact time at shorter contact times, but unlike in CO2 hydrogenation, the conversion of CO did not saturate quickly and could reach 94% at a longer contact time (Fig. 2c). Moreover, the selectivity of CO2 and that of hydrocarbons in CO hydrogenation did not change significantly with the contact time. This observation is also quite different from that in CO2 hydrogenation and suggests that CO2 is formed in parallel to hydrocarbons via the WGS reaction in CO hydrogenation (Scheme 1). Similar to the trend in CO2 hydrogenation, the selectivity of C2 − C12 olefins in hydrocarbons did not change significantly with the contact time (Fig. 2d). We further calculated the conversion rate of CO2 or CO and the formation rate of C2 − C12 olefins in the hydrogenation of CO and CO2 at different contact times. The rates in the linear region in the plot of CO2 or CO conversion versus contact time (or at very short contact times) reflect the intrinsic rates. The results displayed in Fig. 3 show that the intrinsic rate of CO conversion is ~ 1.7 times higher than that of CO2 conversion, and the intrinsic formation rate of C2 − C12 olefins in CO hydrogenation is about twice larger as compared to that in CO2 hydrogenation. Therefore, it becomes clear that the hydrogenation of CO proceeds intrinsically faster than the hydrogenation of CO2 over the Na − Zn − Fe catalyst. The catalytic behaviors depended strongly on the pressure of reactants over the Na − Zn − Fe catalyst. In the hydrogenation of CO2, upon increasing the pressure from 0.5 to 2.5 MPa, the selectivity of CO decreased significantly from 79% to 15% accompanying with a remarkable increase in the selectivity of hydrocarbons from 21% to 85% (Fig. 4 a). At the same time, the conversion of CO2 increased from 24% to 38%. These observations clearly demonstrate that the hydrogenation of CO2 to hydrocarbons is much favored at a higher pressure over our catalyst. The significant decrease in the selectivity of CO and the corresponding increase in that of hydrocarbons on increasing the pressure also suggest that while the RWGS reaction of CO2 to CO occurs facilely at lower pressures, the subsequent hydrogenation of CO requires higher pressures. Further, a higher pressure is beneficial to the formation of C2 − C12 olefins; the selectivity of C2 − C12 olefins in hydrocarbons increased from 65% to 78% and that of CH4 decreases from 29% to 14% as the pressure increased from 0.5 to 2.5 MPa (Fig. 4b). This is likely because the chain growth is facilitated at a higher pressure. For the hydrogenation of CO, the CO conversion increased steeply from 19% to 97% with an increase in the pressure from 0.5 to 3.0 MPa (Fig. 4c). At the same time, the selectivity of hydrocarbons increased from 54% to 72% accompanying with a decrease in CO2 selectivity from 46% to 28%. This observation indicates that the FT reaction is favored over the WGS reaction at elevated pressures. Further, the selectivity of C2 − C12 olefins increased and that of CH4 decreased on increasing the pressure (Fig. 4d). This phenomenon is the same with that observed for CO2 hydrogenation (Fig. 4b), and further supports the idea that the conversion of CO2 to C2 − C12 olefins proceed via CO through the RWGS followed by the FTO reaction (Scheme 1). It is noteworthy that the selectivity of C2+ paraffins did not increase significantly even at longer contact times or high pressures, and the ratio of olefins to paraffins could still keep at > 8. This demonstrates that the present Na − Zn − Fe catalyst can function efficiently for the hydrogenation of CO but is capable of keeping olefin products from hydrogenation."
8,Structural features of the Na − Zn − Fe catalyst,"3.3 Structural features of the Na − Zn − Fe catalyst The Na − Zn − Fe catalyst with a Na content of 1.0 wt% and a Zn content of 28 wt%, which is efficient for the synthesis of C2 − C12 olefins from either CO2 or CO, has been characterized to gain insights into the chemical state of each component. XRD patterns showed that the calcined Na − Zn − Fe catalyst mainly consisted of ZnO phase and ZnFe2O4 spinel phase (Fig. 5 a). After H2 reduction at 673 K, Fe3O4 phase appeared instead of ZnFe2O4 besides ZnO. After CO2 hydrogenation, XRD peaks belonging to Fe3O4 disappeared and those assignable to χ-Fe5C2 was observed, indicating that the iron species was carburized to χ-Fe5C2 during the hydrogenation of CO2. Mössbauer spectroscopy was further employed to identify and quantify the Fe phases. The spectrum of the calcined Na − Zn − Fe catalyst was mainly composed of one doublet with isomer shift (IS) of 0.34 mm s−1 and quadruple splitting (QS) of 0.42 mm s−1 (Fig. 5b), which could be attributed to Fe3+ species [61,62]. The Na − Zn − Fe catalyst after H2 reduction showed two sextets with IS values of 0.30 mm s−1 and 0.59 mm s−1 (Fig. 5c), which were assignable to tetrahedral (A) and octahedral (B) sites of Fe3O4, respectively [52,62]. In addition, a doublet with IS of 0.32 mm s−1 and QS of 0.53 mm s−1 attributable to the high-spin Fe(III), and another doublet with IS of 0.79 mm s−1 and QS of 1.6 mm s−1 attributable to the high-spin Fe(II) were observed in the reduced Na − Zn − Fe catalyst [43,61,63]. This suggests the presence of poorly crystallized iron oxides [46,52]. After the hydrogenation of CO2, sextets with IS values of 0.19–0.24 mm s−1, QS values of 0.03–0.6 mm s−1 and Hhf values of 186, 216 and 112 kOe were observed (Fig. 5d). These sextets were assigned to the crystallographic sites of χ-Fe5C2 [36,52]. The quantification of these sextets reveals that the content of χ-Fe5C2 reaches as high as ~ 97% (Table S2). This result further confirms that the Fe species are almost completely carburized to χ-Fe5C2 species during the hydrogenation of CO2. The TEM with EDS was exploited to investigate the distribution of element and the structural information of the Na − Zn − Fe catalyst after reaction. The TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) results provided further evidence that ZnO and χ-Fe5C2 were the two major phases in the used Na − Zn − Fe catalyst (Fig. 6 a-b). Further, we found that ZnO and χ-Fe5C2 nanoparticles were in close contact with each other (Fig. 6b-c). The line-scan EDS analysis confirmed the close contact of ZnO and χ-Fe5C2 nanoparticles, and indicated that Na+ was dispersed on both ZnO and χ-Fe5C2 particles (Fig. 6d). In short, the characterizations reveal that χ-Fe5C2 is the predominant iron phase in the efficient Na − Zn − Fe catalyst after the hydrogenation of CO2. The working catalyst is composed of ZnO and χ-Fe5C2 in close contact, while Na+ is dispersed on both ZnO and χ-Fe5C2 particles."
9,"Roles of χ-Fe5C2, ZnO and Na+ in hydrogenation of CO2 and CO to olefins","3.4 Roles of χ-Fe5C2, ZnO and Na+ in hydrogenation of CO2 and CO to olefins To unravel the role of each component in the Na − Zn − Fe catalyst in selective hydrogenation of CO2 and CO into C2 − C12 olefins, we fabricated several model catalysts with well-defined phases. Pure-phase χ-Fe5C2 was fabricated by reduction and carburization [60] of an iron sample synthesized by a sol–gel method. The Na+−Fe5C2 and ZnO − Fe5C2 samples were fabricated by reduction and carburization of the Na+- and ZnO-modified Fe samples preliminarily prepared by the sol–gel method, respectively. Pure ZnO was also prepared by the sol–gel method. XRD patterns showed that the ZnO phase was detected in the ZnO and ZnO − Fe2C5 samples fabricated above (Fig. S1). The crystalline χ-Fe5C2 phase was observed in the as-fabricated χ-Fe5C2, Na+−Fe5C2 and ZnO − Fe5C2 samples. HRTEM studies demonstrated the lattice fringes attributable to ZnO and/or χ-Fe5C2 in these samples (Fig. S2). These results confirmed the successful synthesis of ZnO, χ-Fe5C2, Na+−Fe5C2 and ZnO − Fe5C2 model catalysts. N2 adsorption measurements showed that the specific surface areas of the ZnO − Fe5C2 sample and the used Na − Zn − Fe catalyst were 43–46 m2 g−1, larger than those of the ZnO, Fe5C2 and Na+−Fe5C2 samples (Table S3). We further estimated the sizes of ZnO and χ-Fe5C2 crystallites in these model catalysts by using XRD peaks with the Scherrer equation. The result showed that the crystalline sizes of ZnO in the model ZnO − Fe5C2 sample and the Na − Zn − Fe catalyst after CO2 hydrogenation were 30 and 32 nm, smaller than that in the model ZnO sample (38 nm). The estimated sizes of χ-Fe5C2 crystallites were ~ 25 nm in the model ZnO − Fe5C2 sample and the used Na − Zn − Fe catalyst, also smaller than those in the model χ-Fe5C2 and Na+−Fe5C2 samples (Table S3). TEM observations further demonstrated the difference in the average sizes of χ-Fe5C2 in the model χ-Fe5C2, Na+−Fe5C2 and ZnO − Fe5C2 samples as well as in the used Na − Zn − Fe catalyst (Figs. S3 and S4, and Table S3). These results not only confirm the successful fabrication of model catalysts with well-defined phases but also demonstrate that the size of χ-Fe5C2 phase in the catalyst becomes smaller in the presence of ZnO. We subsequently studied the catalytic behaviors of the ZnO, χ-Fe5C2, ZnO − Fe5C2 and Na+−Fe5C2 model catalysts for the hydrogenative conversions of CO2 and CO, and the performances of these model catalysts were compared with that of the Na − Zn − Fe catalyst. The characterization results indicate that the particle sizes of ZnO and χ-Fe5C2, surface area, and the phase compositions do not change significantly after 10 h of reaction for CO2 and CO hydrogenation over these model catalysts (Table S4 and Figs. S5-S9), and thus the catalytic performances can be direct related to the phase and component of the model catalysts. The sole ZnO catalyst showed a CO2 conversion of 9.3% with 85% CO selectivity during the hydrogenation of CO2, and CH4 was the major product in the hydrocarbons (Table 2 ). In the hydrogenation of CO, the CO conversion was only 4.2% and CH4 was also the major product over ZnO alone. These results imply that ZnO can catalyze the RWGS reaction, i.e., the hydrogenation of CO2 to CO, but it is less efficient for the hydrogenation of CO to hydrocarbons. It is of interest that the χ-Fe5C2 and Na+−Fe5C2 were less efficient for the conversion of CO2, but these two model catalysts showed high conversion of CO (75–82%) in the hydrogenation of CO, although the product distributions in hydrocarbons were similar in the hydrogenation of CO and CO2 (Table 2). This suggests that χ-Fe5C2 is efficient for the transformation of CO but is almost inactive for the conversion of CO2. The presence of Na+ on χ-Fe5C2 significantly changed the distribution of hydrocarbon products in CO hydrogenation; CH4 and C2 − C12 paraffins were the major products and the selectivity of C2 − C12 olefins was only 35% over χ-Fe5C2 alone, whereas C2 − C12 olefins became the major products with a selectivity of 78% over Na+−Fe5C2, and meanwhile the ratio of C2 − C12 olefins to paraffins increased markedly from 0.81 to 9.5. Similar roles of Na+ in changing the product selectivity were observed in the hydrogenation of CO2 by changing the catalyst from χ-Fe5C2 to Na+−Fe5C2 despite the low CO2 conversions. Previous studies proposed that the alkali metal promoter might contribute to enhancing the olefin selectivity through facilitating the formation of χ-Fe5C2 species [27,28,31,36,40]. Our present work undoubtedly demonstrates that Na+ plays a pivotal role in the selective formation of C2 − C12 olefins even though the catalyst is dominated by χ-Fe5C2. As compared to χ-Fe5C2 and Na+−Fe5C2, the ZnO − Fe5C2 catalyst showed a significantly higher CO2 conversion (35%) (Table 2). The product distributions in CO2 and CO hydrogenation over ZnO − Fe5C2 were similar to those over χ-Fe5C2 alone, and saturated paraffins including CH4 were the major products. The Na − Zn − Fe catalyst composed of Na+, ZnO and χ-Fe5C2 demonstrated both high CO2 conversion and high C2 − C12 olefin selectivity in the hydrogenation of CO2. We have further examined the stability of Na+−Fe5C2 and Na − Zn − Fe catalysts for CO2 and CO hydrogenation, and the results are displayed in Fig. 7 . Our Na − Zn − Fe catalyst was very stable in CO2 hydrogenation; both the conversion and product selectivity remained unchanged with time on stream during 100 h reaction. Since the CO2 conversion over the Na+−Fe5C2 was quite low, it was difficult to evaluate the stability of this catalyst in CO2 hydrogenation. We thus compared the stability of Na+−Fe5C2 and Na − Zn − Fe catalysts in CO hydrogenation. The result shows that the CO conversion over the Na+−Fe5C2 catalyst decreased from 82% to 73% within the first 50 h on stream, and then decreased slightly during the next 50 h. In contrast, the Na − Zn − Fe catalyst demonstrated high stability in 100 h of time on stream, and the CO conversion and product selectivity did not undergo significant changes. Further characterizations of the two catalysts after 100 h reactions revealed the sintering of χ-Fe5C2 in the Na+−Fe5C2 catalyst (Fig. S10), in which the particle size of χ-Fe5C2 increased from 30 nm to 46 nm. This phenomenon was reported in previous studies [50,64]. The sintering of χ-Fe5C2 during the long-term reaction was alleviated by presence of ZnO in the Na − Zn − Fe catalyst (Fig. S5). Thus, ZnO in the Na − Zn − Fe catalyst could avoid the sintering of the active phase and keep the catalyst stable in the long-term reaction. The results obtained with model catalysts enable us to gain in-depth insights into the role of each component in the Na − Zn − Fe catalyst, which is composed of Na+, ZnO and χ-Fe5C2, and demonstrates high CO2 or CO conversion and C2 − C12 olefin selectivity. There is no doubt that χ-Fe5C2 functions for the activation of CO and H2, and the C − C chain growth, working as the active site for the FTO reaction. Our present results unravel that ZnO mainly functions for the RWGS reaction, promoting the CO2 conversion to CO, although the presence of ZnO in the Na+−Fe5C2 may also contribute to enhancing CO conversion in the subsequently FTO reaction (Table 2) by decreasing the size of χ-Fe5C2 particles (Table S3). This is supported by the fact that without ZnO, the χ-Fe5C2 and Na+−Fe5C2 catalysts show high CO conversion but are less efficient for the conversion of CO2. Further, ZnO in the Na − Zn − Fe catalyst can keep the catalyst stable in long-term reactions by avoiding the sintering of χ-Fe5C2. Na+ plays a decisive role in enhancing the selectivity of C2 − C12 olefins by suppressing the formation of CH4 and C2 − C12 paraffins. The positive role of Na+ in suppressing the hydrogenation of olefins has been verified by using C3H6 as a model molecule. The hydrogenation of C3H6 to C3H8 was significantly suppressed by addition of Na+ to ZnO − Fe5C2 (Table S5). Na+ can suppress the hydrogenation ability of χ-Fe5C2 and facilitate the desorption of olefins due to the increased basicity. Scheme 2 displays a plausible reaction mechanism based on the results described above for the hydrogenation of CO2 to olefins. Our present work suggests that ZnO catalyzes the RWGS reaction. It is likely that CO2 and H2 molecules are adsorbed and activated on ZnO surfaces to form CO2* and H*, followed by the hydrogenation of CO2* to CO* and OH* species, and the OH* species is subsequently converted to H2O by another H* species. The CO* species formed nearby the interface may diffuse onto χ-Fe5C2, where the FTO reaction, i.e., the hydrogenation of CO to CH x (1 ≤ x ≤ 3) species, followed by C − C coupling to C n H m intermediates and then dehydrogenation to C2 − C12 olefins, takes place. The CO* species far from the interface may first desorb to gaseous phase and then diffuse to χ-Fe5C2 to be hydrogenated to C2 − C12 olefins. Na+ on χ-Fe5C2 surfaces plays crucial roles in enhancing the selectivity of C2 − C12 olefins by regulating the hydrogenation ability and facilitating the desorption of C2 − C12 olefins."
10,Effect of proximity between ZnO and χ-Fe5C2,"3.5 Effect of proximity between ZnO and χ-Fe5C2 The reaction mechanism proposed above indicates that the interplay between ZnO and χ-Fe5C2 is important to facilitate the tandem catalysis for the RWGS and subsequent FTO reactions. The proximity between ZnO and χ-Fe5C2 is expected to affect the catalytic performance. Many recent studies have pointed out that the spatial arrangement of different active components plays a pivotal role in bifunctional or multifunctional catalysis [57,58,65,66]. However, the effect of the proximity between the RWGS and FTO catalyst components in Fe-catalyzed CO2 hydrogenation is not known. We found that the dual-bed configuration with upstream ZnO and downstream Na+−Fe5C2 separated by a layer of inert quartz wool with height of 5 mm showed a lower CO2 conversion, whereas the CO selectivity was higher (Fig. 8 a). The increase in the proximity between ZnO and Na+−Fe5C2 by changing the integration manner from dual-bed mode in millimeter scale to granule stacking in one bed with micrometer scale (Fig. 8b) and further to mortar-mixing catalyst in one bed with micro-to-nanometer scale (Fig. 8c) significantly enhanced the CO2 conversion and decreased the CO selectivity. A further increase in the proximity between the two components into nano-scale by fabrication of Na − Zn − Fe catalyst with the sol–gel method, which is normally used in the present work, further increased the CO2 conversion and decreased the CO selectivity (Fig. 8d). Moreover, the increase in the proximity increased the selectivity of C2 − C12 olefins in hydrocarbons from 70% to 78% and decreased the selectivity of CH4 selectivity at the same time. The results described above clearly indicate that the closer proximity results in the higher CO2 conversion, the lower CO selectivity and the higher C2 − C12 olefin selectivity. Thus, the interface between ZnO and χ-Fe5C2 plays a key role not only in enhancing both CO2 and CO conversions but also in improving the olefin selectivity. The closer proximity and larger interface can facilitate the diffusion or transfer of CO from ZnO to χ-Fe5C2. We speculate that the rapid removal of CO from ZnO may accelerate the subsequent adsorption of CO2 and H2 on its surface sites, thus leading to higher CO2 conversion. Our present result that the CO selectivity decreases with an increase in the proximity also suggests the larger interface can increase the efficiency of CO hydrogenation, i.e., the FTO reaction on χ-Fe5C2. This synergistic effect is quite interesting and may imply that the hydrogenation of CO species diffused from the nearby ZnO via the interface is more efficient than the hydrogenation of CO molecules transferred via the gas phase. Regarding the change in the selectivity of hydrocarbon products, we speculate that the separation of χ-Fe5C2 from ZnO would lead to longer contact of the formed CO with ZnO, leading to higher CH4 selectivity. This is because ZnO mainly catalyzes the methanation of CO (Table 2). The increase in the proximity would facilitate the diffusion or transfer of CO from ZnO to χ-Fe5C2, on which CO is hydrogenated to C2 − C12 olefins. Thus, the selectivity of CH4 decreases and that of C2 − C12 olefins increases on increasing the proximity or interface between ZnO and Na+−Fe5C2. Therefore, the increase in proximity or interface between the RWGS and the FTO active phases or sites is a useful strategy for design of efficient tandem catalysts for the transformation of CO2 to olefins."
11,Conclusion,"The Na − Zn − Fe catalyst fabricated by a sol–gel method demonstrated high activity, selectivity and stability towards the formation of C2 − C12 olefins in the hydrogenative conversions of both CO2 and CO. The CO2 hydrogenation offered C2 − C12 olefin selectivity of 78% and C2 − C12 olefin yield of 25% at 613 K, while the selectivity and yield of C2 − C12 olefins were 77% and 51%, respectively, in CO hydrogenation under comparable reaction conditions. We attained a space–time yield of C2 − C12 olefins of 3.4 g gcat −1h−1 from CO2 hydrogenation over the Na − Zn − Fe catalyst, which is significantly higher than those reported to date. We unraveled that the hydrogenation of CO proceeded faster than that of CO2. It is clarified that the hydrogenation of CO2 proceeds by a tandem route via the RWGS to CO followed by the FTO to C2 − C12 olefins. Our Na − Zn − Fe catalyst is composed of ZnO and χ-Fe5C2 phases with Na+ dispersed on both ZnO and χ-Fe5C2. We disentangled the role of each component by carefully studying the model catalysts of ZnO, χ-Fe5C2, ZnO − Fe5C2 and Na+−Fe5C2, and the results revealed that ZnO works for the RWGS reaction, while χ-Fe5C2 is responsible for the hydrogenation of CO to hydrocarbons. Na+ in the catalyst enhanced the selectivity of C2 − C12 olefins by regulating the hydrogenation ability and facilitating the desorption of olefins. The presence of ZnO not only efficiently catalyzes the RWGS reaction but also improves the activity and stability of CO hydrogenation by controlling the size of χ-Fe5C2. We further discovered that a closer proximity between ZnO and χ-Fe5C2 is beneficial to both CO2 conversion and C2 − C12 olefin selectivity. The larger interface is proposed to facilitate the diffusion and transfer of CO intermediate from ZnO to χ-Fe5C2, favoring CO2 adsorption and subsequent CO hydrogenation, and thus the formation of C2 − C12 olefins."
