0,Introduction,"Water splitting, which needs a cathode and an anode in media, has been in limelight due to ecofriendly production of hydrogen from water, which has a high energy mass ratio without gaseous emissions compared to fossil fuel [1–3]. Another reason why water splitting has been become more interested is that the involved acidic and cathodic electrodes also can be applied for degradation of pollutants in wastewater, also known as electrochemical oxidation [4–6]. For practical usage, the electrode materials should possess highly electrocatalytic activity, long-term stability in given electrolytes, and cost-effectiveness not only for hydrogen production but also for electrochemical oxidation [7,8]. Platinum is known as a highly effective electrocatalyst, however, the low abundance and high cost of platinum significantly hinder its use in water electrolysis device, and platinum is not universally stable in a wide range of electrolytes such as wastewater [9,10]. Similarly, most electrodes are easily corroded in electrolytes and under the various conditions of wastewater. Copper, which has distinct characteristics such as cost-effectiveness and high thermal and electrical conductivity, have been widely used in various applications. However, bare copper has been regarded as not an appropriate material for electrochemical applications due to its poor anticorrosion property in strong electrolytes such as acidic environments and wastewater. As strategies to improve the anticorrosion property of copper, carbon coating and alloy of copper and other metals has been considered [11–16]. Although carbon coating on copper for electrochemical applications have been researched by using carbon black [15] and graphene [16], their low electrocatalytic activity and delamination problem from the copper cause different limitations for water splitting. Alloying has been considered as a means of changing the chemical composition by incorporating other metals to enable the use of copper in water splitting. Among the many types of metal alloys for anticorrosion, bimetallic copper-nickel alloys have garnered research interest, as nickel shows good resistance to corrosion in alkaline solution and interacts synergistically with copper [17–21]. According to H. Nandy and M. Negem who researched alloying via electrodeposition for the development of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) cathodes, the HER activity of copper-nickel alloys differs in acidic and alkaline solutions depending on the copper content of the surface [19,20]. However, although nickel deposited on copper foil shows decreased electrochemical impedance, the stability is still low and the electrocatalytic activity is less than satisfactory. Recently, nickel-copper alloy with graphitic carbon encapsulation have been researched as a HER catalyst through a sol-gel process and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method by Shen et al. [21]. In this case, it has been reported that the graphitic carbon encapsulation protects the alloy from corrosion and decreases the charge transfer resistance (R ct ) in acidic, neutral, and alkaline solutions. However, the electrocatalytic activity of alloy nanoparticles can be easily varied depending on type of substrate, mass loading of nanoparticles and formation technique [22]. Although CVD−grown monolayer graphene on copper-nickel alloy fabricated using electrodeposition has been researched by Huang et al., the process requires a long time for fabricating the single-crystal copper nickel alloy. To the best of our knowledge, other studies of graphene on copper nickel alloys did not focus on the electrochemical aspects [23,24], indicating CVD−grown graphene on copper nickel alloy as a HER catalyst has not yet been studied. In this research, we developed new synthesis method for copper-nickel alloy and succeeded graphene growth on the copper-nickel alloy at the same time for water splitting cathode. On copper foil, doctor-blade for carbon black, electrodeposition for nickel, and CVD methods for alloying process and graphene growth were carried out sequentially. The existence of carbon layer between copper and nickel facilitates the use of less nickel for synthesis of the copper-nickel alloy keeping the nickel and copper content on the surface. With the synergistic effect of copper-nickel alloy and graphene, outstanding stability and highly electrocatalytic activity of prepared sample were confirmed in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH. Importantly, graphene coated copper-nickel alloy even showed high stability and electrocatalytic activity compared to those of copper-nickel alloy and Pt through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) 2,000cycles and cathodic reaction for 24 h in acidic and alkaline media containing formaldehyde. As a HER cathode, high faradaic efficiency of graphene coated copper-nickel alloy were estimated by real time hydrogen measurements from acidic and alkaline wastewater respectively."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of graphene on copper-nickel alloy,"2.1 Synthesis of graphene on copper-nickel alloy Copper foil with dimensions of 1 cm × 2 cm × 25 μm (MTI Inc., USA; purity: > 99% Cu) was cleaned in acetone and deionized water. Amorphous carbon black with a particle size of 30−40 nm (Super P, Timcal) was dried in an oven at 120 °C for 12 h and placed in a vial with stainless steel balls for high-energy ball milling (HEBM). A binder was made by mixing 90 wt% amorphous carbon black and 10 wt% polyvinyl alcohol and poly acrylic acid before coating onto the copper foil. The amorphous carbon black mixture was uniformly coated on the copper foil by using the doctor-blade method. For nickel electrodeposition, nickel (II) sulfate hexahydrate (NiSO4·6H2O, 99%) was purchased from Kanto Chemical Company. As a cathode, the copper electrode coated with amorphous carbon black was immersed in 1 M nickel sulfate solution (200 mL) and Pt was used as a counter electrode. Nickel was deposited on the copper covered by carbon at constant current of 10 mA cm−2 for 30 min. After the electrodeposition process, the electrode was washed with deionized water for 1 min to remove the nickel sulfate on the surface and dried for 2 h at room temperature. Graphene was layered on the deposited nickel covered by carbon under low vacuum conditions at 1000 °C for 30 min through CVD. Before reaching 1000 °C, the furnace was purged with argon (50 sccm) and hydrogen (25 sccm) to get rid of impurities in the furnace, and methane (50 sccm) was introduced into the furnace at 1000 °C for 30 min. Further, to investigate the role of the carbon layer, samples of nickel deposited on copper with and without carbon layer were also heated at 1000 °C for 30 min under only argon (50 sccm) and hydrogen (20 sccm) environment. The cooling was controlled at a rate of 10 °C min−1."
3,Materials characterizations,"2.2 Materials characterizations For surface characterization, Raman spectra were acquired with a X-plora Horiba spectrometer (Horiba Jobin-Yvon, France) equipped with a 532 nm solid-state laser source. By employing a low laser power of 5.1 mW, damage to the sample from laser-induced heating was mitigated. The morphology of the electrodes was confirmed by field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; Hitachi S-4300SE) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXs). An X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS; Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., USA) equipped with a micro-focused Al-Kα source was used to analyze the chemical composition of the samples. The chemical composition depending on the depth profile was measured by angle resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AR-XPS; Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) using a theta probe system at 10, 30, 50, 70, and 90°."
4,Electrochemical evaluation,"2.3 Electrochemical evaluation A conventional three-electrode IVIUM Technologies VERTEX potentiostat/galvanostat was used for the electrochemical measurements. The electrochemical HER activity of the samples was analyzed in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH electrolytes. In the case of the three-electrode cell, the prepared samples were used as the working electrode, Pt mesh as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE, Hg/Hg2Cl2) as the reference electrode. LSV was performed at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1, and cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out by increasing the scan rate in 20 mV s−1 increments up to a scan rate of 300 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data were acquired at the overpotential in the frequency range of 100 k to 0.1 Hz as a Nyquist plot. A 24 h stability test and liner sweep voltammetry (LSV) for 2,000 cycles at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 were carried out using wastewater containing formaldehyde (0.5 M H2SO4 + 0.01 M formaldehyde and 1 M KOH + 0.01 M formaldehyde). The real amount of hydrogen produced at the electrode was measured by gas chromatography using a thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD; Agilent 7820a, USA) with a circulator for the accumulation system as shown in Fig. S7. The produced hydrogen gas from the wastewater through the electrolysis is moved to GC-TCD by circulator and the hydrogen concentration with Ar is measured by GC-TCD. The rest of hydrogen after being measured flow into reactor again and it is accumulated. Accumulated hydrogen flow in GC-TCD for measuring total hydrogen amount depending on the reacted time."
5,Result and discussion,
6,Preparation and characterizations of graphene on copper-nickel alloy,"3.1 Preparation and characterizations of graphene on copper-nickel alloy Fig. 1 shows the sample preparation steps and corresponding typical SEM images. The copper foil (denoted as Cu foil) was covered with amorphous carbon layer (denoted as Cu@C). Electrodeposited nickel on Cu@C (Ni on Cu@C) was placed in the thermal CVD chamber for growth of few-layer graphene (denoted as CuNi@G), as shown in Fig. 1a. The copper-nickel alloy was formed by the deposition of nickel on Cu@C under same heat treatment conditions without CH4 as a carbon source in the furnace (denoted as CuNi alloy; see details in the Materials and Method section). Morphological characterization by SEM (Fig. 1b−e) showed that carbon and nickel completely covered the entire copper foil. Minor variations were observed after each step, except in the case of CuNi@G. Fig. 1e shows the flake-like morphology formed by the irregular diffusion of nickel and copper in carbon layer, and heterogeneous nucleation of graphene on nickel, where the coverage by electrodeposition was not uniform and the graphene infiltrated the electrode. Raman spectroscopy is an ideal tool for characterization of carbon materials because of its fast and non-destructive characteristics. The Raman spectra of carbon-based materials are characterized by D and G peaks at ∼1350 cm−1 and 1580 cm−1, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2 a and S1a [25]. The D peak generally represents the disorder of graphene, and the G peak originates from the in-plane E2g mode. The 2D peak, which is located at ∼2700 cm−1 in the Raman spectrum of graphene, is more intense than the G peak, compared with the case for amorphous carbon and graphite. As shown in Fig. S1a, the D peak and G peak in the Raman spectra of Cu@C had a wide full-width at half maximum (FWHM) and relatively lower intensity than those of CuNi@G (Fig. 2a). Further, the 2D peak of Cu@C was very small compared with the 2D peak in the Raman spectrum of CuNi@G, which indicates that the carbon in CuNi@G is graphene. Fig. 2b−c show the Raman mapping data for CuNi@G based on the intensity (I D /I G and I 2D /I G ) ratios at 400 points. The defect state of graphene was evaluated by using the I D /I G ratio, and the number of graphene layers is represented by I 2D /I G [19,26]. The I D /I G ratio was below 0.2 and the I 2D /I G ratio was 1–2, except in the case of a few points (>2), indicating the presence of few-layer graphene on the entirety of the substrate, with a small number of defects. To understand the chemical composition and binding states of the surface, XPS was carried out. In case of Cu@C, there were four binding peaks at 284.5, 285, 286.5, and 288.1 eV, corresponding to sp2 carbon, sp3 carbon, C–O–C, and CO, respectively; these carbon-oxygen bonds indicate defects (Fig. S1c) [27,28]. Fig. 3 a shows two peaks at 284.5 and 286.5eV, corresponding to sp2 carbon and C–O–C bonding, accounting for the small defects of CuNi@G. Fig. S1b−e indicate that a large amount of carbon and a negligible amount of copper were the only species on the surface of Cu@C, where the carbon layer was too thick for deep penetration via XPS. However, Fig. 3b−c show that a large amount of Cu (based on the Cu 2p peak) and a relatively small quantity of nickel were also present on the surface of CuNi@G, indicating alloying of copper with nickel during growth of the graphene layer. Copper existed as only pure metallic copper and nickel existed as pure nickel and a small amount of nickel oxide in CuNi@G [29,30]. This surface phenomenon can be explained by vacancy diffusion, which is proportional to the temperature [31]. During the synthesis of graphene, copper and nickel simultaneously inter-diffuse to form an alloy. To confirm the role of the carbon film in the inter-diffusion of copper and nickel, nickel was deposited on copper with and without carbon black by electrodeposition and annealed at 1000 °C for 30 min under vacuum conditions. Nickel was clearly apparent on the copper with carbon black (based on XPS); however, no nickel was observed on the copper in the absence of carbon black (Fig. 3d). The presence of carbon black hinders the interdiffusion of copper and nickel so that the presence of nickel on the surface was clearly observed, even after high-temperature synthesis (Fig. 3e). Because the absence of sp3 carbon, corresponding to large defects, on the surface of CuNi@G was already confirmed from the Raman spectra (Fig. 2a) and XPS (Fig. 3a) analysis, it is clear that the majority of the carbon black did not move to the outer surface during graphene growth. Fig. 4 a shows the variations in the atomic proportion of carbon, copper, and nickel based on AR-XPS, where the data were acquired at various incident X-ray angles. By decreasing the incident X-ray angle, it is possible to generate a relatively thinner surface depth profile [32]. CuNi@G was analyzed at 20° intervals corresponding to X-ray angles of 10, 30, 50, 70, and 90°. As the incidence angle increased, the atomic percentage of carbon decreased, whereas that of copper and nickel increased. This indicates that at an angle of 90°, the X-rays penetrate the copper-rich region and an X-ray angle of 10° measures the few-layer graphene region, including a small copper-nickel alloy region. Further, the atomic percentage of copper compared with nickel increased sharply when the incidence angle was changed from 70 to 90°. This observation means that as the X-rays penetrate deeper into the surface, there is more copper than nickel, because the carbon layer prevents deep diffusion of nickel, which is consistent with the XPS profiles of the copper-nickel alloy with and without the carbon layer (Fig. 3d). In order to determine the chemical composition and morphology of the copper nickel alloy region, the copper-rich region and carbon black were physically torn off, followed by SEM and EDXs analysis. Fig. 5 a shows the SEM image of each layer after dividing CuNi@G into three parts. The EDXs mapping indicates that the three regions have different chemical compositions (Fig. 5b−e). More copper than nickel was present in the middle part, termed the copper-rich region, and there was a large amount of nickel as well as copper in the outer parts, termed the copper-nickel alloy region. This is corroborated well by the XPS and AR-XPS surface analysis data. Carbon was distributed evenly in the three parts (Fig. 5c) because the amount of carbon is relatively small compared to that of the other components and the carbon layer was easily detached when the electrode was physically divided into three parts. The presence of the carbon layer was confirmed by removal of the top layer, as shown in Fig. S2. EDXs mapping of the carbon layer showed that the majority of carbon black was localized in the copper-rich region; the detached carbon area is highlighted by red in Fig. S3. It seems that the major portion of carbon black was retained even after graphene growth at 1000 °C."
7,Electrochemical results and analysis,"3.2 Electrochemical results and analysis In order to investigate the HER performance, LSV experiment for CuNi@G was carried out in 0.5 M H2SO4 (pH 0) and 1 M KOH (pH 14) in the region of 0 to −0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The working electrodes of Cu foil, Cu@C, Ni on Cu@C, CuNi alloy and Pt mesh were also tested for comparison (Fig. S4). For specific comparison of electrocatalytic activity, Fig. S5 exhibit the onset & overpotential at −10 mA cm−2 (ŋ10) for all prepared electrodes as a bar graph. In acidic electrolyte, the CuNi alloy and CuNi@G were determined as 248 and 144 mV of ŋ10, and ŋ10 for the Cu foil, Cu@C, and Ni on Cu@C were 313, 413, and 307 mV, respectively. In alkaline solution, ŋ10 for the CuNi alloy and CuNi@G were 354 and 216 mV. ŋ10 for the Cu foil, Cu@C, and Ni on Cu@C were 632, 597, and 387 mV, respectively, indicating improved electrocatalytic activity depending on the materials on the substrate. The onset overpotential, which is the potential at which there is a current rise, was obtained from LSV and Tafel slope to specifically compare the electrocatalytic activities of prepared electrodes. The onset potentials of CuNi@G were 95 and 158 mV versus RHE in the acidic and alkaline media respectively, indicating higher electrocatalytic activity due to the alloy and graphene. The stabilities of electrodes were presented as dash lines over 2,000 LSV cycles at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 in the voltage range of 0 to −0.8 V versus RHE for around 20 h. Although the CuNi alloy was stable in acidic solution, CuNi@G showed a negligible change between the first cycle and 2,000th cycle. On the other hand, the CuNi alloy showed poor stability in the alkaline electrolyte, CuNi@G maintained good performance even after 2,000 cycles. To explain the HER kinetic, Tafel plots were used in Fig. 6 c and d. Tafel slopes show the similar trend with LSV regarding improved electrocatalytic activity depending on each process of CuNi@G. Tafel slopes of CuNi@G are 58 and 80 mV dec−1 in acidic and alkaline electrolytes respectively which is close to Tafel slopes of Pt (30 and 58 mV dec−1). Figs. S4c–d show Tafel slopes of Cu foil, Cu@C, Ni on Cu@C and CuNi alloy which are 129, 127, 107 and 100 mV dec−1 in acidic solution and 191, 201, 123 and 119 mV dec−1 in alkaline solution respectively. These results indicate that CuNi@G has the outstanding and stable kinetics toward HER in acidic and alkaline electrolyte compared to pristine metal and bimetallic alloy using copper and nickel. In general, HER mechanism of Pt, which shows Tafel slope of 30 mV dec−1 in acidic electrolyte, is known as Volmer-Tafel reaction (Volmer: H+ + e− → Hads, Tafel: 2Hads→ H2). The Tafel slope of CuNi@G (58 mV dec−1) is lower than other pristine metal and alloy using copper and nickel, however, it is not enough to explain that HER mechanism of CnNi@G is governed by Volmer-Tafel reaction because of still higher Tafel slope than that of Pt. Thus, it is elucidated that the HER mechanism of CuNi@G is close to Volmer-Heyrovsky reaction (Volmer: H+ + e− → Hads, Heyrovsky: H+ + Hads + e− → H2). To better understand the electrocatalytic activity, CV and ECSA experiments were performed. Fig. S6 presents typical CV graphs of CuNi@G and CuNi alloy in the non-faradaic region to explain the ECSA. From measurement of the current density at 0.44 V versus RHE at 20 mV s−1 increments over the scan rate range of 20–300 mV s−1, a proportional relationship was obtained, and Fig. 6e obtained from the CV data shows a linear relationship between the double-layer capacitance and the ECSA. The electrical double-layer capacitance of the CuNi alloy and CuNi@G were 203 and 384 μF cm−2, respectively, indicative of improvement of the ECSA of CuNi@G compared to that of the CuNi alloy. EIS analysis of the electrodes was carried out at the same overpotential from 100 k to 1 Hz and the Nyquist plot was used for analysis of the resistance. The Nyquist plots of Cu foil and Cu@C showed a relatively large semicircle compared to that of the CuNi alloy and CuNi@G (Fig. 6f). The solution resistance (R s ) of the Cu foil, Cu@C, Ni on Cu@C, CuNi alloy, and CuNi@G were 3.4, 1.7, 2.6, 1.4, and 1.9Ω, respectively, confirming that there was no significant difference. However, the charge R ct of Cu foil, Cu@C, Ni on Cu@C, CuNi alloy, and CuNi@G were 20, 24.2, 11, 7.4, and 4Ω, corresponding to the ŋ10 trend from the LSV analysis. Based on the improved ECSA and the lowest R ct value, it is confirmed that the HER performance of CuNi@G is outstanding compared to that of the congeners in the general electrolytes. The HER performance and stability of the electrodes in wastewater containing formaldehyde were evaluated, as exhibited in Fig. 7 . As shown in Fig. 7a−b, CuNi@G exhibited the highest stability in acidic and alkaline wastewater after 2,000 LSV cycles. The CuNi alloy showed no significant change in the stability between the 1st and 2000th cycle in acidic wastewater, but a small potential change was observed in alkaline solution. However, Pt mesh showed lower stability than those of the CuNi alloy and CuNi@G in acidic and alkaline solutions (Table S1). In order to investigate sustainable hydrogen production from wastewater, 24 h hydrogen evolution reaction test was carried out at constant voltage. Fig. 7c−d show the i−t curves of the CuNi alloy, CuNi@G, and Pt mesh at −0.2 V versus RHE. The poor stability of Pt was also confirmed by the i−t curve. High electrocatalytic activity of Pt was observed for the first hour; however, the current density became unstable over the next around 20 h. The current density of Pt decreased almost to the current density of CuNi@G in acidic wastewater. On the other hand, the stability of the CuNi alloy and CuNi@G in acidic and alkaline solutions containing formaldehyde was outstanding. Initial and final current density of each electrode were compared and exhibited in Table S2. The current retention after 24 h reaction show that Pt mesh has the poorest current retention in acidic (11.9%) and alkaline wastewater (68.6%) compared to others. In case of CuNi@G, the current densities after 24 h reaction were even increased instead of decrease in acidic (119.8%) and alkaline wastewater (109.4%) both. It is ascribed that electrochemically derived defect of graphene made the electrocatalytic activity slightly improved. Even though the CuNi alloy is highly stable in acidic solution, because of its inferior electrocatalytic activity compared with that of the other samples, the current density was lower than that of CuNi@G. CuNi@G with better electrocatalytic activity and high stability in acidic and alkaline wastewater is suitable as an outstanding cathode for use in hydrogen production and wastewater treatment. To quantify the real hydrogen amount from the wastewater, GC-TCD and circulation systems were used and Faradaic efficiency was determined as well, which describes the theoretical value when charge is transferred in the system through the electrochemical reaction. A calibration curve was constructed by using argon and hydrogen gas and, the accumulated hydrogen gas from the HER was measured at 10 min intervals by using the circulator system. Argon purging was also carried out for 1 h to remove the other gases to allow detection of only hydrogen from CuNi@G and oxygen from the Pt mesh by GC-TCD. The Faradaic efficiency was calculated by applying Eq. (1): (1) Faradaic efficiency ( % ) = A m o u n t o f p r o d u c t s ( m o l e ) × n I × t × 10 where t is the duration of the experiment, I is the current, and n is the number of electrons transferred. Fig. 8 shows that the amount of hydrogen produced with CuNi@G and the theoretical hydrogen production were comparable. By comparing the accumulated amount of hydrogen and the theoretical value, the Faradaic efficiency was determined as 88 and 92% at 30 mA for 40 min of reaction using acidic and alkaline wastewater, respectively. This indicates that the high stability and electrocatalytic activity of graphene and the alloy improve hydrogen production from wastewater [33,34]."
8,Conclusions,"In this study, we proposed the highly stable and electrocatalytic-active electrode by alloying copper with nickel during the graphene growth for the first time. Considering the copper and nickel diffusivity at high temperature (1000 °C), the carbon layer between copper and nickel was used to hinder the metals inter-diffusion. Moreover, CVD-grown graphene was characterized by Raman and Raman mapping at 400 points, indicating low defect and uniformity of graphene on the entire surface of copper-nickel alloy. The distributions of copper and nickel were confirmed through the XPS and AR-XPS and cross section of CuNi@G was analyzed by SEM with EDXs as well. With advantages of alloy and graphene, CuNi@G exhibits pH independent and great HER performance which is 4 times more improved than electrocatalytic activity of pristine copper foil and highly stable. Furthermore, the remarkable current retention which is even more than 100% (119, 109%) after 24 h reaction and the high Faradaic efficiency (88% and 92%) in the wastewater indicate that CuNi@G is a suitable not only for electrochemical oxidation cathode where it needs high stability and but also for hydrogen production from wastewater. Therefore, it is anticipated that this new synthesis method using carbon layer between copper and nickel for CuNi@G provides the new concept of carbon use for alloying. Furthermore, the high stability and electrocatalytic activity of CuNi@G demonstrate that it can be used future water splitting electrodes with other electrocatalysts for commercialization."
