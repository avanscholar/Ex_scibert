0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) is a considerable green and renewable energy. A lot of attention is presently paid to develop photo- or electro-catalysts to solve environmental issues and to produce solar hydrogen because of its high-energy capacity and environmental friendliness [1]. The photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water splitting with semiconductors under solar irradiation is a promising way to produce hydrogen, which has attracted many researchers to extensively investigate and develop appropriate semiconductor photocatalysts to increase their photocatalytic activity [2–7]. The enhancement of photocatalytic performance is generally owing to a fast transfer of photogenerated electrons from the semiconductor to metal leading to the longer lifetime of the excited charge carriers [8]. Besides, a suitable band gap (< 3.2 eV) and structure of the photocatalysts (heterojunction, p-n junction or phase junction), surface reactivity (doped cocatalysts), particle size and distribution of cocatalysts are also key factors for a photocatalytic reaction [9]. Recently, conjugated polymer nanostructures coupled with narrow band gap and unique π-conjugated electron systems as a new class of photocatalysts have received much attention in various photocatalysis applications such as water treatment [10–13] and green H2 production. [14,15]. However, the photocatalytic efficiency of pristine conjugated polymers is very low due to their rapid charge carrier recombination and sluggish reaction kinetics. A promising way to increase the photocatalytic property of conjugated polymer-based photocatalysts is their combination with semiconductors such as poly(benzothiadiazole) (BBT) [16], poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) [17], or polypyrrole (PPy) [18] modification with titania. Conjugated-titania composites with conjugated polymers present in general high absorption efficiency in the visible region, less electron-hole recombination, high charge carrier mobility, good stability and excellent biocompatibility. In addition, introducing cocatalysts in conjugated-titania heterostructures can remarkably enhance the photocatalytic efficiency due to the prolonged life time of the charge carriers and increased active sites. Although some conjugated polymer-semiconductor-based ternary structure nanocomposites have been successfully constructed such as Pt@TiO2/g-C3N4 [19], CdS/Cu7S4/g-C3N4 [20], Au/TiO2(P25)-gC3N4 [21], little attention has been paid to considering the multiple electron transfer pathways. Indeed, the multiple electron-transfer pathways are very important for the charge carrier separation and hot electron transfer and accumulation by manipulating deposition cocatalysts on different catalysts in a ternary system [22]. Based on the above considerations, here we successfully fabricated for the first time the ternary hybrid PPy-TiO2 nanocomposite with small Pt nanoparticles (2 nm) induced by radiolysis, and we controlled the deposition site on PPy, TiO2 or on both PPy-TiO2 (noted respectively (Pt-PPy)-TiO2, (Pt-TiO2)-PPy and Pt-(PPy-TiO2)). The photocatalytic performance of the different Pt-modified PPy-TiO2 composites for hydrogen production under both ultraviolet and visible light irradiation were investigated. The results indicate that Pt-(PPy-TiO2) structures exhibit significantly enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production due to more efficient electron separation and transfer compared with (Pt-PPy)-TiO2 and (Pt-TiO2)-PPy. Our work provides a promising method for the design of ternary nanostructures of metal-semiconductor-conjugated polymer hybrids with high photocatalytic activity for production of solar fuels."
1,Experimental Section,
2,Materials Preparation,"2.1 Materials Preparation PPy nanostructures were synthesized by chemical polymerization according to our previous work. In brief, hexagonal mesophases used as soft template were made of a mixture of NaCl (0.2 M), SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.8 g), cyclohexane as oil phase (6 mL) and surfactant (n-pentanol, 400 μL). FeCl3 used as oxidant (0.1 M) was added into the mixture, which was vortexed. PPy nanostructures were obtained by oxidation of Py by Fe3+ in the mesophases for 2 h. The mesophase was then destabilized by adding ethanol. Finally, the PPy nanostructures powder was collected by centrifugation, washing and drying [11]. TiO2 P25 was purchased from Evonik Industries AG. The PPy/TiO2 composite was obtained by putting PPy and TiO2 in contact under ultrasounds (30 min) in ethanol suspension. Different PPy/TiO2 mass ratios were obtained. For the photocatalytic tests the optimized mass ratio between PPy and TiO2 was found to be 1/4. Radiolysis is a powerful technique to synthesize metal nanoparticles (NPs) of controlled sizes and shapes [23]. Pt NPs were synthesized by radiolysis (using a panoramic 60Co γ source) at a dose rate of 4 kGy h-1. The metal salts or complexes (here PtII(acac)2 purchased from Aldrich) are reduced by solvated electrons and alcohol radicals induced by solvent radiolysis [14]. In the following preparation of samples process, the samples are using theoretical loading rate of Pt (1 wt%). The preparation route of (Pt-PPy)-TiO2 is the following: Firstly, the PPy nanostructures (20 mg) were added to an ethanoic solution containing platinum acetylacetonate (5 × 10-5 M). The tube containing the dispersion was closed with a septum, degassed with N2, and then irradiated with γ-rays (60Co γ source). After 30 min irradiation at a dose rate of 4 kGy h-1, the Pt-PPy powder was collected after centrifugation, it was then rinsed with water and ethanol and dried. In a second step, the Pt-PPy composite (20 mg) was mixed with TiO2 (80 mg) in 25 mL of ethanol under sonication. Finally, the (Pt-PPy)-TiO2 was dried in the oven at 60 °C for overnight (Fig. 1 a). Synthesis of (Pt-TiO2)-PPy. The synthesis procedure of (Pt-TiO2)-PPy was summarized in Fig. 1b. The preparation route is similar to that of (Pt-PPy)-TiO2. The only difference is that, in the first step, TiO2 (80 mg) was dispersed into 25 mL of an ethanol solution containing the PtII precursor (2 × 10-4 M). The dispersion was irradiated under N2 atmosphere. The following steps were the same like the above mentioned. Synthesis of Pt-(PPy-TiO2). PPy (20 mg) were mixed with TiO2 (80 mg) in an ethanol solution (25 mL) containing platinum acetylacetonate (2.5 × 10-4 M). Then the mixture was sonicated for 10 min to disperse the aggregated nanoparticles and then degassed with N2. The samples were exposed to γ-rays for 30 min (Fig. 1c). Samples with different loading rates of Pt on PPy-TiO2 were also synthesized labeled as x%Pt-(PPy-TiO2)."
3,Characterizations,"2.2 Characterizations Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL JEM 2010 UHR operating at 200 kV) was used to observe the morphology and the structures of nanomaterials. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the samples were recorded with a Cary 5000 Series, Agilent Technologies. Time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) technique was applied to investigate the lifetime of charge carrier of photocatalysts under different excitation wavelengths. A pulsed light source (Nd: YAG laser) equipped with an optical parametric oscillator (OPO; EKSPLA, NT342B) was used to excite the samples and a Gunn diode (30 GHz) was used to generate microwaves. The principle of TRMC was described in Supporting Information [24–26]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were carried out on an Alpha X-ray Spectrometer with monochromatic Al/Kα under ultrahigh vacuum. C 1s peak (284.6 eV) was used as reference. The electrochemical measurements were performed in Origalys workstation with a three-electrode system (the prepared sample electrode, counter electrode of Pt foil and a Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference). The working electrodes were prepared by dispersing the samples (3 mg) in ethanol (3 mL) on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate. The samples were then dried at room temperature. For photocurrent density with time (i-t) curve was recorded at a potential of −200 V. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution with an amplitude of 10 mV, Frequency: 0.1 Hz-1000 Hz at 0.2 V."
4,Photocatalytic tests,"2.3 Photocatalytic tests The photocatalytic activity of the different samples for hydrogen generation under UV and visible light was evaluated. 20 mg of the photocatalyst were dispersed in water-methanol mixture solution (20 mL, Vmethanol/ Vwater is 1/4) under stirring. The suspension was bubbled with N2 to remove oxygen and then illuminated under 300 W xenon lamp. For the experiments under visible irradiation, a filter cutting at 420 nm was used. Every 10 min (for UV light) or 1 h (for visible light), 0.2 mL of the gas was taken and injected in the gas chromatograph (GC, Shimadzu GC-14B) instrument to analyze the amount of H2."
5,Results and Discussion,
6,Characterizations of the photocatalysts,"3.1 Characterizations of the photocatalysts Fig. 2 presents the TEM images of Pt-(PPy-TiO2), (Pt-TiO2)-PPy, (Pt-PPy)-TiO2 nanocomposite materials. When the Pt precursor is irradiated in the presence of the PPy-TiO2 composite, Pt NPs are formed on both TiO2, on the polymer and at the interface, with a preferential deposition on PPy. The TEM images of Pt-(PPy-TiO2) present small and monodisperse Pt nanoparticles (black dots, ∼2.2 nm, Fig. S1) on the surface of the PPy-TiO2 composite (Fig. 2a–b). The yellow circled parts show preferential deposition of Pt NPs on PPy nanostructures (NSs). Fig. 2c–d shows TEM images of the samples with Pt NPs synthesized on TiO2 previous to the heterojunction with PPy: 2 nm Pt NPs uniformly dispersed on the TiO2 were observed. In addition, Pt NPs were found to deposit at the edges of TiO2 by radiolytic reduction [27] and Pt NPs were not observed on PPy. Fig. 2e–f present TEM images of the samples with Pt NPs synthesis on PPy NSs previous to the heterojunction with TiO2: Pt NPs of homogeneous size were well dispersed on PPy, and no Pt NPs were observed on TiO2. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 3 a. The absorption bands from 200 nm to 400 nm are observed owing to the electrons promotion of TiO2 from valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) [28]. Compared with bare TiO2, Pt-TiO2 show higher absorption under visible light and red shift (to some extent), which characterize the optical properties of Pt NPs on TiO2 [29]. Thanks to the strong absorption of PPy in the visible light region, Pt-(PPy-TiO2) shows high absorption intensity from 400∼800 nm, indicating a significantly improved activation under visible light. Moreover, based on the Kubellka-Munk method, the estimated band gap for TiO2, Pt-TiO2 and Pt-(PPy-TiO2) are 3.20 eV, 3.06 eV and 2.83 eV, respectively (Fig. 3b). The narrower band gap of Pt-(PPy-TiO2) is mainly attributed to the heterojunction of titania with PPy nanostructures, which can adsorb more photons to provide more photogenerated charge carriers and improve the photocatalytic property of the photocatalyst. The TRMC technique was used to evaluate the dynamics of charge-carriers in TiO2-based composites at different wavelengths. Fig. 4 a presents the TRMC signals at 360 nm excitation for pure TiO2, and its platinized form. Pt NPs accelerate the decay at short time range, and does not modify it at long time range [30]. Pt NP are known to be a sink for electrons, and a sharp fast decay of the signal for the Pt-modified samples is obtained: Pt NPs deposited on TiO2 act as electron scavengers decreasing the recombination of charge-carriers, which is beneficial for the photocatalytic activity [20]. Nevertheless, in our previous work, after introducing PPy in TiO2, the lower signal decay in PPy-TiO2 than pristine TiO2 was obtained, which may be due to PPy shield effect, fast recombination effect, or fast electron trapping [31]. Interestingly, Fig. 4a evidences that the TRMC signal of Pt-(PPy-TiO2) is not an addition of separate effects of Pt and PPy. A synergetic influence seems to occur. Indeed, the observed signal is quite flat, with a very slow decay. It indicates a real low amount of fast recombination and free e- with high lifetime resulting from good charge-carrier separations. Those effects should be favorable to the activity. Under visible illumination (at 420 and 450 nm), as expected, the TRMC signal is reduced. Pt-(PPy-TiO2) shows faster decay at very short range time compared to that of Pt-TiO2 and TiO2, which indicates more efficient electron trapping and transfer. Moreover, Pt-(PPy-TiO2) presents a slightly longer lifetime of electrons from the trend of long-rang decay than that of Pt-TiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 4b–c). The TRMC signals of (Pt-PPy)-TiO2, (Pt-TiO2)-PPy and Pt-(PPy-TiO2) under UV, at 360 nm, are shown in Fig. 4d: Unlike Pt-(PPy-TiO2), the composites (Pt-PPy)-TiO2 and (Pt-TiO2)-PPy present a fast-global decay, leading to a really low number of charge-carriers after 0.2 μs. It means that the synergetic effect is only observed on Pt-(PPy-TiO2), which leads to the most efficient electron transfer and the longest life time of electrons. In (Pt-TiO2)-PPy and Pt-(PPy-TiO2) the fast decay seems to be due to high level of recombination or at least, bad charge-carrier separation. The surface composition and chemical states of (Pt-PPy)-TiO2, (Pt-TiO2)-PPy and Pt-(PPy-TiO2) were studied by XPS spectroscopy (Fig. 5 a–d). The full spectrum of Pt-(PPy-TiO2) contains the signals of C, N, O, and Pt (Fig. S2). Pt 4f spectrum of Pt-(PPy-TiO2) shows that part of Pt in the composite is oxidized. The doublet at 70.78 eV (Pt 4f7/2) and 73.98 eV (Pt 4f5/2) corresponds to metallic Pt which are lower than pure metallic Pt (Pt 4f7/2 = 71.2 eV) due to the electron transfer happens from TiO2 and PPy to Pt nanoparticles with higher work function [32]. The binding energy at 74.95 eV (Pt 4f7/2) and 76.41 eV (Pt 4f5/2) are corresponding to PtO2, (Fig. 5a) [33]. Different valence states of Pt nanoparticles can provide higher active sites and more oxygen defects, which is beneficial for surface chemical adsorption and catalysis [19]. The characteristic peaks of Ti 2p3/2 (458.9 eV) and Ti 2p1/2 (464.6 eV) spectrum of (Pt-PPy)-TiO2, (Pt-TiO2)-PPy and Pt-(PPy-TiO2) show a slight shift (0.4 eV) toward higher binding energies compared to pure TiO2 (458.5 eV, Ti 2p3/2) (Fig. 5b). With reference to previous reports on TiO2 [34,35], such higher energy shifts suggest the formation of heterojunction and interactions of the ternary compounds [36]. The C 1s signal for the PPy is located at a binding energy of 284.9 eV (C-C), 286.2 eV (C-O) and 289.0 eV (O-C=O), respectively (Fig. 5c). The N 1s high resolution spectra in Fig. 5d can be fitted into two peaks, which can be attributed to N-C (399.9 eV) and N-C = O (409.1 eV) [37]. The transient photocurrent response curves of (Pt-PPy)-TiO2, (Pt-TiO2)-PPy and Pt-(PPy-TiO2) are shown in Fig. 6 a. As expected from the TRMC results, the photocurrent intensity of Pt-(PPy-TiO2) is 2.7 times higher than that of (Pt-PPy)-TiO2 and (Pt-TiO2)-PPy under AM1.5 G, which suggests enhanced efficiency of charge transfer and separation of electron-hole pairs in this sample. Additionally, EIS Nyquist plots were used to explore the interface charge transfer resistances of the electrode materials. The smallest semicircle in EIS for Pt-(PPy-TiO2) further demonstrated the highest efficient and fastest interfacial charge transfer ability than (Pt-PPy)-TiO2 and (Pt-TiO2)-PPy (Fig. 6b). These results are consistent with TRMC results and strongly support the excellent photocatalytic activity of Pt-(PPy-TiO2) shown by the following photocatalytic tests."
7,Photocatalytic tests for hydrogen generation,"3.2 Photocatalytic tests for hydrogen generation In order to achieve a good photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production, different volume ratios of methanol-water mixture (Fig. S3), sacrificial electron donors (Fig. S4), and mass ratios of PPy and TiO2 were investigated (Fig. 7 a). As shown in Fig. S2, hydrogen production with 1%Pt-(PPy-TiO2) increased with increasing methanol content until reached to 25%. The photocatalytic activity decreased when the Vmethanol/Vwater was more than 25%, and the very low conversion rate was obtained for the case of 100% water or pure methanol. F. Besenbacher et al. revealed a proton-transfer mechanism that proceeds via an H3O+-like transition state, which can explain why the methanol-water mixture presents higher photocatalytic activity compared with pure methanol [38]. The effect of different sacrificial reagents (with the same concentration: 0.2 M) for photocatalytic hydrogen generation was studied (Fig. S3). We have found that the highest yield of hydrogen was obtained by the use of methanol owing to the partial production of hydrogen through the methanol conversion (MeOH + H2O → CO2 + 3H2, Δ G° =16.1 kJ/mol) [39]. Furthermore, it is clearly observed that the weight ratio (PPy/TiO2) has a great influence on hydrogen production (Fig. 7a). Modification of TiO2 with a small amount of PPy (maximum 25% in mass) induced an increase in its photoactivity. The photocatalytic activity of 1%Pt-(PPy-TiO2) is maximum for the PPy/TiO2 mass ratio 2:8 and decreases drastically with higher ratios. The presence of a large amount of PPy may cover the surface of TiO2 hindering the light absorption and the injection of excited electrons from the LUMO of PPy to the CB of TiO2 [40]. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution experiments were conducted in aqueous solution containing 25% methanol as a hole scavenger. The photocatalyst (1%Pt-(PPy-TiO2)) is very active for hydrogen production in pure water under UV and visible light. The yield of H2 production reaches 850.0 μmol and 27.0 μmol after 5 h under UV and visible light irradiation, respectively (Fig. 7b). As shown in Fig. 7c–d, 1%Pt-(PPy-TiO2) exhibits the highest activity for hydrogen production with 125.1 mmol h-1 g-1 under UV light and 3.2 mmol h-1 g-1 under visible light irradiation compared with other loading rates of Pt NPs. The hydrogen evolution rate of 1%Pt-(PPy-TiO2) was greatly enhanced with composite materials with appropriate proportion. 1%Pt-(PPy-TiO2) photocatalyst shows a significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen generation (125.1 mmol h-1 g-1 and 3200 μmol h-1 g-1 under UV and visible light irradiation, respectively) compared with the same loading rate of Pt NPs deposited on PPy (11.8 mmol h-1 g-1 under UV light and 70.9 μmol h-1 g-1 under visible light, respectively) and TiO2 (24.2 mmol h-1 g-1 under UV and 454.2 μmol h-1 g-1 under visible light irradiation), respectively (Fig. 8 a). The higher photocatalytic activity of Pt NPs deposited on PPy-TiO2 can be ascribed to the routes of effective electron transfer (e-PPy(LUMO)→Pt and e-PPy(LUMO)→TiO2(CB)→Pt) compared with (Pt-PPy)-TiO2 and (Pt-TiO2)-PPy. Other photocatalysts for hydrogen production have been compared in Table S1. Our photocatalyst Pt-(PPy-TiO2) is very active for hydrogen production under both UV and visible light, and its performance equal or even surpasses the literature reports for photocatalysts based on TiO2 or PPy (Table S1) For practical applications, it is important to check the stability of the photocatalyst. Fig. 8b shows that the photocatalyst Pt-(PPy-TiO2) is stable with cycling."
8,"Electron transfer mechanism in (Pt-PPy)-TiO2, (Pt-TiO2)-PPy and Pt-(PPy-TiO2)","3.3 Electron transfer mechanism in (Pt-PPy)-TiO2, (Pt-TiO2)-PPy and Pt-(PPy-TiO2) The migration of electrons under visible-light in the ternary photocatalysts can be explained by the proposed mechanism in Fig. 9 . Firstly, photocatalytic hydrogen generation involves three main steps: (i) light absorption, (ii) charge carriers generation and charge transfer to the surface of photocatalysts, and (iii) surface redox reactions [41]. Here, PPy as a photosensitizer was used to absorb the incident light to generate e- and h+. Pt NPs used as a cocatalysts not only serve as an e- sinks, but also provide proton reductive sites, and centers for H· radical recombination leading to H2 formation [14]. As shown in Fig. 9a, for the (Pt-PPy)-TiO2 system, the photogenerated electrons in the LUMO of PPy transfer to Pt NPs of PPy surface and also to TiO2 CB. Then, the protons can be reduced into H· on the surface of Pt much more efficiently than on bare TiO2. Pt NPs help also to form H-H bond to lead to H2. The oxidation of an electron donor (such as methanol) with h+ happened on the HOMO of PPy (MeOH→3H2 + CO2). In (Pt-TiO2)-PPy ternary system, PPy is introduced to create electrons from the HOMO to LUMO under visible light illumination (Fig. 9b). The photo-induced electrons migration from PPy to the TiO2 CB due to the position of the PPy LUMO is much more negative than that of TiO2, and are eventually injected into the low Fermi level of Pt. As a result, rapid charge separation and slow charge recombination occurred, which results in a good photocatalytic performance. This electron transfer scheme is also illustrated in other ternary systems such as PPy-Ag-TiO2 [40], TiO2/CuO/Cu [42], In2O3-TiO2-Pt [43]. More interestingly, the Pt-(PPy-TiO2) composite shows the best photocatalytic activity compared with (Pt-PPy)-TiO2 and (Pt-TiO2)-PPy, because the active Pt sites coexist in both PPy and TiO2 (as seen in Fig. 2a–b). Fig. 9c illustrates two efficient routes of electron transfer. The excited electrons from PPy LUMO migrate to the surface of PPy and TiO2, and then are trapped by Pt deposited on PPy and TiO2 leading to very efficient separation of charge carriers. The most efficient charge carrier separation and transfer in Pt-(PPy-TiO2) compared with (Pt-PPy)-TiO2 and (Pt-TiO2)-PPy were demonstrated by TRMC technique and photoelectrochemical tests. Furthermore, Pt NPs act as a cocatalysts for H+ reduction and as a site for H·recombination. The synergistic effect of the two electron transfer routes and formation of PPy-TiO2 heterojunction facilitate the photocatalytic reaction process."
9,Conclusions,"In summary, different ternary nanostructures based on PPy-TiO2 composites with controlled site modification with Pt nanoparticles were designed. The photocatalytic activity of Pt-(PPy-TiO2) for hydrogen generation under UV and visible light is very high and drastically surpasses those of (Pt-PPy)-TiO2, (Pt-TiO2)-PPy and Pt-TiO2. With modification of both PPy and TiO2 surface with Pt NPs, an efficient electron transfer from PPy to Pt NPs and through TiO2 to Pt were achieved, which leads to higher charge carriers’ separation and accumulation of electrons for the Pt-(PPy-TiO2) compared with (Pt-PPy)-TiO2 and (Pt-TiO2)-PPy. More electrons are driven by and to the Pt nanoparticles, which also act as cocatalysts for H+ reduction and H-H bond formation. The Pt-(TiO2-PPy) photocatalyst is stable with cycling. This composite may find promising applications in solar fuels generation. This study will open perspectives in the rational design of ternary composites to facilitate charge transfer for high efficient conversion of solar to chemical energy."
