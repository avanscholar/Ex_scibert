0,Introduction,"Molasses is a viscous liquid waste that remains after the manufacture of sucrose from crops such as sugarcane. The formation amount of molasses is about 50 million tons annually [1], and the material still contains 40 to 50 wt% of sucrose, glucose, and fructose in total [2]. Accordingly, molasses is a potential biomass resource for the production of renewable chemicals. A promising target is sugar alcohols including sorbitol and mannitol, which can be synthesized by the hydrolysis of sucrose to glucose and fructose followed by the hydrogenation (Fig. 1 ) [3]. Sorbitol is annually produced in 650 kt as a sweetener, moisturizer, and precursor to vitamin C, sorbitan, and isosorbide [4]. Sorbitan is a feedstock for the production of surfactants for foods and horticulture supplies, while isosorbide is a medicine for glaucoma and converted to antianginal drugs and engineering plastics [5–10]. In addition, conversion of sorbitol to fuels has recently been studied in laboratories [11,12]. Mannitol is a non-hygroscopic compound used as a desiccant for tablets and chewing gums, medicines, and a precursor to explosives [7]. An isosorbide analog for mannitol, isomannide, is a potential feedstock for the production of engineering plastics [5,13]. The sugar alcohols are produced from starch and fructose syrup in the current chemical industries. As an alternative resource, molasses is advantageous over the current feedstock in terms of lower price and waste utilization. However, there has been no report on the catalytic conversion of molasses to sugar alcohols to our knowledge. Moreover, such crude biomass often contains impurities that potentially work as catalyst poisons in the chemical conversion [2,14]. Especially, hydrogenation catalysts are sensitive to impurities [15–17]. Thus, the study on the effect of catalyst poisons and their removal is crucial to establish biorefinery. Herein, we report the conversion of sugarcane-derived molasses to sugar alcohols with a heterogeneous nickel catalyst. Adsorption pretreatment of molasses, effect of the pretreatment on the hydrolytic hydrogenation to produce sugar alcohols, catalyst poisoning, and physical chemistry of the catalytic reaction were studied."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials A sugarcane molasses containing 32 wt% sucrose, 4.4 wt% glucose, and 6.6 wt% fructose was provided by Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc. Sucrose, glucose, fructose, L-cysteine, L-aspartic acid, humic acid, H2SO4, 35% hydrochloric acid, formic acid, 30% H2O2 were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries. Montmorillonite K 10 (denoted MK10; 270 m2 g−1; N2 adsorption isotherm and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) plot Fig. S1), activated carbon Norit SX Ultra (denoted AC; 985 m2 g−1; N2 adsorption isotherm and BJH plot Fig. S2), activated Raney® Ni (30 m2 g−1), 3-mercaptopropionic acid were given by Sigma-Aldrich. Milli-Q water was used in all experiments. H2 and N2 gas were obtained from Air Liquide Kogyo Gas."
3,Pretreatment of molasses,"2.2 Pretreatment of molasses Pristine molasses was pretreated by filtration and adsorption to remove catalyst poisons. The pristine viscous molasses (4.2 g) was diluted with 35.8 g water, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min and decantation for better handling. The sample is denoted M-Centrifuged. M-Centrifuged was filtrated with a mixed cellulose ester membrane (Advantec, 25AS045AN, 0.45 μm pores) and named M-Filtrated. Besides, M-Centrifuged was treated with 2.1 g of adsorbent (MK10 or AC) with stirring at ambient temperature for 1 h. Subsequently, the solid part was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min and decantation. This adsorption treatment was repeated once more, and the obtained liquid was finally filtrated with the membrane. The pretreated samples were named based on adsorbent used, M-MK10 and M-AC. The sugar composition of each sample was analyzed by a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC; LC-10ATvp, Shimadzu) equipped with an auto sampler (SIL-20A, Shimadzu), a Rezex RPM-Monosaccharide Pb++ column (Phenomenex), and a refractive index detector (RID-10A, Shimadzu). An absolute calibration method was used to determine sugar concentration with a good area reproducibility (error < 0.1%). About composition of the treated molasses samples, we utilized elemental analysis service of the Global Facility Center, Hokkaido University to determine the content of C, H, N, and S with CE-440 elemental analyzer (Exeter Analytical). Concentration of inorganic anions was analyzed with ICS-3000 ion chromatography (Dionex) with an IonPac AS-12A column (2.8 mM Na2CO3 with 0.3 mM NaHCO3, 1.5 mL min−1, 30 °C). Amino acid analysis was carried out after hydrolyzing proteins by the facility center mentioned above, according to the procedure shown in a literature [18]."
4,Conversion of molasses to sugar alcohols,"2.3 Conversion of molasses to sugar alcohols A pretreated molasses solution was diluted with water to adjust the total concentration of sugars to 1 wt%. Raney® Ni (280 mg) was added to the solution of 40 g in a Teflon-coated high-pressure reactor (100 mL, MMJ-100, OM Lab-Tech) after removing sticking water on the catalyst with a paper towel. pH of the solution was adjusted to 3.0 by using 1 M H2SO4 aq. The hydrolytic hydrogenation was conducted under 5 MPa of H2 at 140 °C with stirring at 600 rpm for 4 h, and afterward the reactor was quickly cooled down to room temperature by cold water. Products were quantified by HPLCs equipped with Rezex RPM-monosaccharide Pb++ (Phenomenex) and Sugar SH-1011 (Shodex) columns. Yield of products are shown in %C unit based on the total carbon amount of sucrose, glucose, and fructose in molasses."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization Textural properties of Raney® Ni and adsorbents were analyzed by N2 adsorption at −196 °C (BELSORP-mini II, BEL Japan). Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) measurements were performed under vacuum with EDX-720 (Rh target, Shimadzu). Trace amounts of Ni in solutions were quantified by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES; ICPE-9000, Shimadzu), and higher concentrations of Ni were measured by ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy ([Ni(H2O)6]2+ d-d transition 400 nm and 680 nm; V-650, Jasco)."
6,Density functional theory calculations,"2.5 Density functional theory calculations Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the interaction between organosulfur compounds and Ni metal. Seven Ni atoms were located at the same positions as Ni(111) surface, and they were fixed except for the center one. The chemical structure was optimized after putting an adsorbate on the top of central Ni atom at the unrestricted B3LYP/LanL2DZ (Ni)/aug-cc-pVDZ (S)/cc-pVDZ (C, H) level of theory with spherical harmonics and an ultrafine grid using Gaussian 16 software [19–22]. Septet was chosen for the spin state because of the low energy and low spin contamination."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Pretreatment of molasses,"3.1 Pretreatment of molasses We studied pretreatment of molasses to remove potential catalyst poisons such as proteins and complicated organosulfur and organonitrogen compounds similar to humins [23]. Three types of pretreatments were performed for the diluted and centrifuged molasses (M-Centrifuged): filtration (M-Filtrated) and the adsorption treatment with MK10 or AC followed by filtration (M-MK10 and M-AC) (see Experimental). MK10 and AC are often used for the adsorption of proteins in food industries [24]. Sugar content in the molasses samples was determined to clarify if the pretreatment lost sugars (Table 1 ). Based on the sugar concentration in M-Centrifuged (3.3 wt% sucrose, 0.44 wt% glucose, and 0.69 wt% fructose; 4.4 wt% in total), the sugar content was not changed after filtration (M-Filtrated) or the adsorption pretreatment with MK10 (M-MK10). Thus, the adsorption of sugars on MK10 was less than detection limit. In contrast, AC decreased the sugar amount to 2.0 wt% sucrose, 0.38 wt% glucose, and 0.42 wt% fructose (total 2.8%). The polycyclic aromatic surface of AC adsorbs sugar molecules by CH–π dispersive interactions and hydrophobic interactions in water [25–27]. The amounts of organic S and N were determined by subtracting the amount of inorganic ions (SO4 2−, NO2 −, NO3 −, NH4 +) from the total content of organic and inorganic S and N determined by elemental analysis (Table 1; detailed data Table S1). M-Centrifuged contained 0.041 wt% organic S and 0.049 wt% organic N, and the concentration was slightly decreased after the filtration pretreatment (S 0.036 wt%, N 0.045 wt%). The filter (0.45 μm pores) removes fine particles including a part of humins, which contain S and N atoms [28]. MK10 more effectively decreased the organic S (0.031 wt%) and N (0.037 wt%),compared to the simple filtration. MK10 is negatively charged in aqueous phase due to the cation exchange property [29,30], whereas nitrogen-containing organic molecules such as proteins are positively charged because amino groups are protonated in molasses (pH 5–6) [31]. Hence, MK10 adsorbs such compounds by electrostatic interactions. AC showed the highest performance for the adsorptive removal of organic S (0.009 wt%) and N (0.021 wt%). Possible adsorption sites are surface oxygenated functional groups and polycyclic aromatics [32]. Taking into account the low acidity of AC bearing only a small amounts of weak acid sites (carboxylic groups 0.08 mmol g−1), polycyclic aromatics may drive the adsorption by dispersion force and hydrophobic interactions. Consequently, AC adsorbs a larger amount of organosulfur and organonitrogen compounds than MK10, but the material also adsorbs sugars. The adsorption of sugars is unavoidable due to the large adsorption equilibrium constants (e.g., glucose 220 M−1 for a similar activated carbon [26]). We assumed that MK10 and AC adsorbed proteins, which contributed to the decrease in organic S and N content in part. To confirm this assumption, proteins in the pretreated molasses samples was quantified as the amount of amino acids after hydrolyzing proteins (Table 2 ). M-Centrifuged contained 0.13 wt% of amino acids in total, where aspartic acid was the predominant constituent (0.064 wt%). As expected, the total amount of amino acids was decreased to 0.11 wt% by MK10 and to 0.069 wt% by AC. Moreover, the sulfur-containing amino acids, cysteine (including cystine) and methionine, were similarly reduced by the pretreatments."
9,Influence of pretreatment of molasses on the catalytic reaction,"3.2 Influence of pretreatment of molasses on the catalytic reaction Hydrolytic hydrogenation of molasses to sugar alcohols was performed at 140 °C at pH 3 under H2 pressure of 5 MPa for 4 h, after diluting the molasses samples with water to be 1 wt% sugars in total (Table 3 ). For example, M-Centrifuged was diluted by 4.4 times to be 0.75 wt% sucrose (corresponding to 75 %C among the three sugars), 0.10 wt% glucose (9.6 %C), and 0.15 wt% fructose (15 %C). Raney® Ni was chosen as a catalyst because of the high activity for the hydrogenation of sugars [33]. Catalyst support was not used in this study to avoid the adsorption of impurities on the support that makes effect of impurities unclear. Initially, we employed an aqueous solution of reagent pure sugars at the same concentration as those in M-Centrifuged. This reaction almost completely converted sugars to sorbitol in 71 %C and mannitol in 25 %C (total 96 %C, entry 1), thus showing that the catalytic activity and selectivity are high enough in the absence of impurities. Next, as a non-purified molasses sample, M-Centrifuged was employed for the catalytic reaction, which gave only 24 %C yield of sorbitol and 8.7 %C of mannitol (total 33 %C). Sucrose decreased from 75 %C to 6.3 %C by the smooth hydrolysis, but large amounts of glucose (21 %C) and fructose (19 %C) remained due to inhibition of the hydrogenation. Moreover, 21% of C was missing because of the formation of undetectable by-products such as humins. The large difference in the two reactions shows that impurities need to be removed. For the effect of pretreatment, the filtration of molasses slightly improved the catalytic performance (sorbitol 28 %C, mannitol 10 %C; entry 2). The adsorption pretreatment with MK10 more obviously improved the yield of sorbitol (39 %C) and mannitol (14 %C) (entry 4), and that with AC achieved 68 %C yield of sorbitol and 27 %C yield of mannitol (entry 5). The total yield (95 %C) is as high as that in the conversion of pure sugars (96 %C, entry 1), although the yield corresponds to 60 %C based on the original content of sugars in molasses due to the adsorption by AC (95 %C × 2.8/4.4). These results demonstrate that the adsorption pretreatment is effective for the conversion of sugars in molasses to sugar alcohols. Fig. 2 shows effect of organic S and N content on the hydrolytic hydrogenation of molasses samples. As the molasses samples were diluted to be 1 wt% sugars for the catalytic reaction, the S and N contents shown in the figure corresponds to the diluted solution. This plot clearly depicts the inverse correlation between concentration of the impurities and yield of sugar alcohols, thus suggesting that they are main catalyst poisons. To evaluate the poisoning effect of organosulfur and organonitrogen compounds, we conducted controlled experiments in the hydrolytic hydrogenation of reagent sugars (Table 4 ). First, L-aspartic acid was added as a model of organonitrogen compounds because this compound was the major amino acid found in molasses. The concentration of L-aspartic acid was set at 0.10 wt% so that the concentration of organic N became the same as that in M-Centrifuged at 1 wt% sugar (0.011 wt%; see Fig. 2). Only slight inhibition (sorbitol 64 %C, mannitol 24 %C, entry 6) was observed compared with the reaction in the absence of inhibitors (sorbitol 71 %C, mannitol 25 %C, entry 1), and therefore influence of organic N was minor. Second, the influence of organic S was studied with adding L-cysteine to be 0.009 wt% organic S. This compound decreased the yield of sorbitol (43 %C) and mannitol (16 %C) and increased by-products (13 %C) (entry 7). Another sulfur source 3-mercaptopropionic acid, which is an amino group-removed cysteine, gave a very low yield of sugar alcohols (sorbitol 4.8 %C, mannitol 2.4 %C, entry 8). Moreover, the addition of a humin-type compound (humic acid) with organic S of 0.009 wt% also caused the catalyst deactivation (sorbitol 42 %C, mannitol 16 %C; entry 9). It is notable that humic acid increased the unidentified by-products (23 %C) as much as that in the reaction of M-Centrifuged (21 %C). Humic acid has reactive functional groups such as furanics and aldehydes in addition to sulfur-containing groups, which react with reducing sugars [34]. The significant influence of organosulfur compounds motivated us to perform EDX analysis of the Ni catalyst used in the conversion of M-Centrifuged, which confirmed the presence of S (0.7 wt%) corresponding to surface Ni:S = 8:1. Because the hydrogenation reaction needs vicinal hydrogen and large sugar adsorption sites, this surface coverage by S is high enough to reduce the catalytic activity. In summary, even though the inhibition effects depend on the specific structure of the compound, sulfur-containing organic compounds predominantly reduce the catalytic activity. Additionally, reactive functional groups in organosulfur and organonitrogen compounds may react with sugars to increase by-products. Therefore, their removal by adsorbents is effective for the production of sugar alcohols. Sulfur-containing functional groups with lone pairs such as thiol strongly chemisorb on metal surface, and in some case the organosulfur is decomposed to form atomic sulfur that covalently bonds to metal [35]. DFT calculations at the PW91 generalized gradient approximation level of theory with a periodic boundary system show that organosulfur adsorbs on Ni(111) surface with the interaction of p orbitals of S and d-band of Ni in the band theory [36]. To improve the clarity of the interaction at the local structural level, we used a more accurate hybrid functional (B3LYP) with the Gaussian-based linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) approximation to model a Ni(111) surface subjected to the adsorption of the simplest sulfur-containing organic compounds, methanethiol and dimethylsulfide. In the calculation, we employed methanethiolate instead of thiol itself, because thiols are cleaved to form thiolates on Ni metal surface [37]. Methanethiolate adsorbed on a bridge site with an adsorption energy of −185 kJ mol−1, while dimethylsulfide bound on the top of a Ni atom with the energy of −35 kJ mol−1. Thiolate is more important for the adsorption, and thus we focused on methanethiolate. The natural bond orbital analysis [38] shows a strong electron donation from occupied hybrid orbitals of S including 3s (42%) and 3p (58%) to unoccupied ones of Ni containing 4s (12%), 4p (64%), and 3d (24%) in average (Fig. 3 ). The adsorption increased the electron density of Ni 4p natural atomic orbitals from 1.12 to 1.23. This result represents that vacancy in Ni 4p predominantly contributes to the adsorption of thiolate."
10,Detailed study for the conversion of M-MK10,"3.3 Detailed study for the conversion of M-MK10 We studied detailed reaction parameters to maximize the yield of sugar alcohols. In the conversion of molasses, pH is an essential factor for this purpose. First, oxonium ions are needed to hydrolyze sucrose to glucose and fructose. At the same time, high concentration of oxonium often leads to the decomposition of sugars and sugar alcohols [39]. Meanwhile, Ni leaches out by the reaction of Eq. (1). (1) Ni + 2H + → Ni 2 + + H 2 Accordingly, the trade-off should be overcome by optimizing pH. M-MK10 was chosen as the substrate for this study, as MK10 selectively decreased catalyst poisons without the adsorption of sugars. By varying the pH from 2 to 5, the yield of sugar alcohols changed significantly. At pH 2, the yield of sugar alcohols was only 14 %C for sorbitol and 6.6 %C for mannitol, while by-products were produced in 34%C (Table 5 , entry 10). The large amount of by-products is attributed to the formation of humins by the catalysis of Brønsted acid [40]. Increasing pH to 3–4, we obtained the highest yield of sugar alcohols (sorbitol 34 %C, mannitol 13–14 %C; entries 4, 11). However, further increase in pH to 5 decreased the yield to 27 %C for sorbitol and 11 %C for mannitol (entry 13). The remaining sucrose in a large quantity (33 %C) evidences slow hydrolysis due to low concentration of oxonium ions. Next, we evaluated the effect of pH on Ni leaching in pure H2SO4 aq. (Fig. 4 ). The logarithm plot of Ni leaching amount against pH depicted a linear correlation described by Eq. (2). (2) log Ni 2 + / mol L − 1 = 0.70 - 0.50 pH Namely, the leaching amount can be exponentially decreased with increasing pH. At pH 3, the leaching amount (6.1 mmol L−1 = 390 ppm) is similar to the equilibrium concentration of Ni2+ in Eq. (1) theoretically estimated with the Nernst equation (Eqs. (3)–(5); 7.9 mmol L−1 = 460 ppm). (3) E = 0 = E 0 − RT nF ln a Ni 2 + a H 2 a Ni a H + 2 (4) ≈ E 0 − RT nF ln Ni 2 + p H 2 10 − 2 pH (5) ⇔ log Ni 2 + / mol L − 1 ≈ 3.9 − 2 pH where E 0 is standard electromotive force (ca. 0.23 V), R gas constant (8.314 J mol−1 K−1), T temperature (413 K), n number of electrons transferred (2), and F Faraday constant (9.65 × 104 C mol−1). However, the actual leaching amounts exceed the theoretical values at pH 3.5–5. This suggests that other Ni species such as Ni(OH)2 are also involved in the leaching phenomenon at pH ≥3.5. Indeed, X-ray diffraction analysis of a Ni catalyst has indicated the presence of Ni(OH)2 after hydrolytic hydrogenation [41]. To summarize, pH 4 provides the best balance among hydrolysis activity, selectivity, and Ni leaching. The Ni leaching amount was only 1.4% of the Ni catalyst used. Time course measurement was performed for the conversion of molasses at pH 4 at 140 °C (Fig. 5 ) and 150–180 °C (Figs. S3–S5). The initial products were glucose and fructose, and they were gradually converted to sorbitol and mannitol. Yield of the sugar alcohols reached 63 %C for sorbitol and 21 %C for mannitol, in total 84 %C, at 16 h at 140 °C (details: Table 5 entry 12). The yield of sugar alcohols were decreased by elevating the reaction temperature owing to side-reactions. We assumed reaction pathways with pseudo first-order rate constants as shown in Fig. 6 (kinetic equations Eqs. (S1)–(S6)). Pseudo first-order analysis is useful for this type of reaction at a low concentration of sugars because the coverage of sugar substrate on metal surface is approximately proportional to the concentration [42,43]. Sucrose is hydrolyzed to glucose and fructose by k 1, glucose is hydrogenated to sorbitol (k 2), and fructose is transformed to sorbitol and mannitol (k 3 and k 4). Due to the presence of reactive hemiacetal groups, glucose and fructose are decomposed to by-products (k 5 and k 6). This model well reproduced the actual experimental data as indicated by the curve fitting lines in Fig. 5, giving rate constants (Fig. 6 and Table S2). The rate constant for the hydrolysis (1.2 h−1) was four to six times larger than those for the hydrogenation of glucose (0.21 h−1) and fructose (total 0.30 h−1), showing that the rate-determining step is the hydrogenation. The formation of by-products was relatively slow (0.045 h−1), thus leading to good yield of sugar alcohols at 140 °C. The Arrhenius plots show that the apparent activation energy (E a) of the hydrogenation steps (86 kJ mol−1) is higher than that of the hydrolysis step (72 kJ mol−1) (Figs. S6–S9). More importantly, E a for the by-product formation is as high as 160 kJ mol−1, and therefore a low temperature is preferable for the selective synthesis of sugar alcohols."
11,Conclusions,"We studied the pretreatment and catalytic conversion of sugarcane molasses to synthesize sugar alcohols using Raney® Ni catalyst. In the adsorption pretreatment of molasses, Montmorillonite K10 selectively reduced organosulfur and organonitrogen compounds with no adsorption of sugars. Pristine molasses gives only 32 %C yield of sugar alcohols, but the adsorption pretreatment with MK10 increased the yield to 53 %C. The correlation between the content of impurities and hydrogenation activity, controlled experiments, and density functional theory calculations show that organosulfur compounds are the main catalyst poisons due to the strong adsorption on Ni by the electron donation from S 3s3p hybrid orbitals to Ni unoccupied ones predominantly consisting of 4p. A further optimization of reaction conditions for M-MK10 increased the yield of sugar alcohols up to 84 %C yield at 140 °C and pH 4 with only a small amount of Ni leaching. The rate-determining step is the hydrogenation of monomeric sugars and a lower temperature more selectively produces sugar alcohols because of the high activation energy for by-product formation."
