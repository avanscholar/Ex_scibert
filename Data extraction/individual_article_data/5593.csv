0,Introduction,"Mammalian spermatozoa are incapable of fertilizing an oocyte just after ejaculation. To be able to fertilize an oocyte they have to undergo a maturational process known as capacitation that occurs in female reproductive tract or can be accomplished in defined media in vitro (Yanagimachi, 1994). The process is characterized by increased membrane fluidity due to changes in membrane lipids and phospholipids, increased bicarbonate uptake and cAMP concentration, increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS; de Lamirande et al., 1997; Olds-Clarke, 2003). Unstimulated rabbit, mouse and human spermatozoa have been shown to generate superoxide anion (O2 −) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) when cultured in vitro and these free radicals were found to be causative agents for lipid peroxidation in mammalian spermatozoa (Holland and Storey, 1981; Holland et al., 1982; Alvarez and Storey, 1984; Alvarez et al., 1987; Aitken and Clarkson, 1987). Subsequently, it was observed that production of these free radicals at low or physiological concentrations are beneficial for sperm functions (de Lamirande et al., 1997). O2 − and H2O2 have been shown to drive the capacitation process in human (Bize et al., 1991; Griveau et al., 1994; de Lamirande and Gagnon, 1993a,b, 1995), bovine (O’Flaherty et al., 1999) and equine (Baumber et al., 2003) spermatozoa. However, the production status of these ROS and their role in sperm functions have not been established in buffalo, an economically important milch animal species of tropical and subtropical countries of the world. Accordingly, in the present study, attempts were made to investigate whether capacitation of buffalo spermatozoa is associated with production of these two ROS."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Bovine serum albumin (BSA, fraction V), catalase from bovine liver, heparin, diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC), phenol red, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, mol. weight 30–70kDa) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were procured from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO, USA). β-Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 2′-phosphate reduced salt (β-NADPH), horseradish peroxidase (HRPO) and N-ethylmaleimide were purchased from Sisco Research Laboratories (Mumbai, India). All other chemicals used in the study were of analytical grade and purchased from local suppliers."
3,Culture medium,"2.2 Culture medium The medium used for washing of sperm was a modified Tyrode's Hepes-buffered medium designated as sp-TALPH, pH 7.4–7.45, osmolarity: 280–285mOsmol/kg and the medium used for sperm culture was a modified Tyrode's bicarbonate-buffered medium designated as sp-TALP, pH 7.40, osmolarity: 265–270mOsmol/kg. Both the media were prepared as described by Galantino-Homer et al. (1997)."
4,Sperm processing,"2.3 Sperm processing Semen was collected from Murrah buffalo bull (Bubalus bubalis) twice a week with an artificial vagina (IMV, France) at Artificial Breeding Complex, National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, India. Semen having progressive motility of 70% and above was only used for the experiments. Within 5–10min of collection, the semen was split into 0.5mL fractions, diluted with sp-TALPH in 1:6 ratios and subjected to two washes by resuspension with 3mL of sp-TALPH and centrifugation at 275× g for 5min each. The loose sperm pellet was resuspended with 3mL of sp-TALP and subjected to a final centrifugation step to remove the sp-TALPH media. The pellet was resuspended with sp-TALP and the sperm concentration was determined by haemocytometer and adjusted to 100×106 cellsmL−1 with sp-TALP. The same sperm suspensions were aliquoted and used for the following experiments."
5,Experiment 1: effect of heparin on buffalo sperm capacitation,"2.4 Experiment 1: effect of heparin on buffalo sperm capacitation Spermatozoa were resuspended at a concentration of 50×106 mL−1 in sp-TALP medium and incubated at 38.5°C with 5% CO2 in air for 6h in the absence (sp-TALP only, control) or presence of heparin (10μg/mL, an inducer of capacitation) in 1.5mL polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes. At hourly intervals sperm motility was monitored on a pre-warmed glass slide under an inverted bright-field microscope at 200× magnification. After 0, 2, 4, and 6h of incubations, the extent of sperm capacitation was evaluated as described below. 2.4.1 Assessment of sperm capacitation To determine the extent of capacitation, sperm samples after various periods of incubations were incubated further with LPC (100μg/mL), a known agent to induce acrosome reaction (AR) in capacitated cells only, according to the method of Parrish et al. (1988). The samples were then subjected to a triple staining procedure to differentiate between live and dead, acrosome-reacted and non-reacted cells (Kusunoki et al., 1989). The percentage of live spermatozoa undergoing AR was determined as a measure of capacitation. At least 200 cells were counted in each sample."
6,"Experiment 2: effect of heparin, β-NADPH, and DPI on the rate of O2 − production","2.5 Experiment 2: effect of heparin, β-NADPH, and DPI on the rate of O2 − production Spermatozoa were resuspended in sp-TALP medium as described in Experiment 1 and pre-incubated at 38.5°C with 5% CO2 in air for 30min in the absence or presence of DPI (10 or 50μM, an uncompetitive inhibitor of NADPH-oxidase). Then these preparations were incubated further in the absence or presence of heparin (10μg/mL) or β-NADPH (1 or 5mM, a substrate of NADPH-oxidase). β-NADPH and DPI were used to induce and inhibit endogenous O2 − production, respectively. After 0, 2, 4, and 6h of incubations, spermatozoa were subjected to O2 − assay to determine the O2 − production capacity of these cells at those times as described below. 2.5.1 Determination of O2 − production by capacitating spermatozoa After various periods of incubations the extracellular O2 − production capacity of spermatozoa was measured by the method of Mazzilli et al. (1994) as modified by us. Briefly, ferricytochrome c was replaced with partially acetylated ferricytochrome c (Sigma, C4186) to avoid any reduction of cytochrome c by cytochrome reductases or cytochrome oxidases normally present in sperm suspensions. The cells of two tubes were pooled and washed twice with sp-TALP-PVA (here, BSA of sp-TALP was replaced with PVA at 1mg/mL) by centrifugation at 360× g for 2min and resuspension. Subsequently, the loose pellet was resuspended with sp-TALP-PVA and supplemented with 100μM acetylated ferricytochrome c and 100U/mL of catalase and incubated at 38.5°C for 1h in the absence and presence of 300U/mL of SOD in a final volume of 500μL sp-TALP-PVA. Subsequently, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 2mL of ice-cold 1mM N-ethylmaleimide. The tubes were centrifuged at 10,000× g for 10min and supernatants were collected. Absorbance of the supernatants was taken at both 550 and 468nm. The tube containing SOD was taken as reference. The O2 − concentration of the sample was calculated by the following formulae using the micromolar extinction coefficient of cytochrome c (0.0242μM−1 cm−1) at 550–468nm (Margoliash and Frohwirt, 1959). Calculation: nmoles of O2 − produced by 108 spermatozoa/hour=[(A sample without SOD at 550–468nm − A sample with SOD at 550–468nm)/0.0242]×D.F.×M.F., where A is the absorbance, 0.0242 is micromolar extinction coefficient of cytochrome c at 550–468nm, D.F. the dilution factor of the assay system and M.F. is the multiplication factor for normalizing the sperm concentration to 108 cells."
7,Experiment 3: effect of heparin on the rate of H2O2 production,"2.6 Experiment 3: effect of heparin on the rate of H2O2 production Spermatozoa were resuspended in sp-TALP medium as described in Experiment 1 and incubated at 38.5°C with 5% CO2 in air in the absence or presence of heparin (10μg/mL) and after 0, 2, 4, and 6h of incubations, subjected to H2O2 assay to determine the H2O2 production capacity of these cells at those times as described below. 2.6.1 Determination of H2O2 production by capacitating spermatozoa This assay was performed according to the method of Pick and Keisari (1980) with minor modification. Briefly, after various periods of capacitation, sperm suspension of four tubes were pooled and was washed twice with 10mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 with 140mM NaCl and 5.5mM dextrose (PPBND) by centrifugation at 360× g for 2min each to remove sp-TALP medium. The sperm pellet was resuspended with 1mL of pre-warmed (38.5°C) PPBND to have final sperm concentration of 100×106 cells/mL. Finally, phenol red and HRPO were added to the suspension at final concentrations of 0.28mM and 8.5U/mL, respectively, and the tubes were incubated at 38.5°C for 1h. At the end of incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 20μL of 1M NaOH and the tubes were centrifuged at 10,000× g for 10min. The supernatants were collected and absorbance was read at 610nm against a blank containing 1mL of PPBND, 0.28mM phenol red, 8.5U/mL HRPO, and 20μL of 1M NaOH. The assay was also carried out in the absence and presence of exogenous catalase (2100U/mL) to determine the specificity of the assay. The values of test samples were determined by extrapolating absorbance values of unknown from the standard curve of H2O2. The actual concentration of commercial 30% (w/v) H2O2 stock was determined by diluting the stock in 1:1000 ratio (v/v) in distilled water and by measuring the absorbance of this solution at 240nm and using a molar absorption coefficient of 43.6M−1 cm−1 (Zadeh, 1999)."
8,Statistical analysis,"2.7 Statistical analysis All the experiments were repeated at least three times with semen samples from different bulls. Data were analysed by ANOVA and statistical differences between the group means were determined by Duncan's multiple range test (DMRT) using the SPSS, version 10.0.1 software (SPSS Inc., USA). Pearson correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between the percentage of capacitation and rates of O2 − and H2O2 produced. A difference with P <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data are expressed as mean±S.E.M."
9,Results,
10,Effect of heparin on buffalo sperm capacitation,"3.1 Effect of heparin on buffalo sperm capacitation The sp-TALP medium sustained the motility of washed buffalo sperm up to 6–7h although there was a progressive decline in the percentage of motility (80–90% at 0h to 70–75% at 6h). When buffalo sperm were incubated in the absence or presence of heparin, sinking of sperm in the form of white pellets to the base of the capacitation tubes occurred after 1–2h of incubation. When observed under microscope, out of the total motile sperms, more than 80% of sperm in both the groups showed progressive motility initially. However, after 2–3h of incubation, the sperm motility pattern changed from the progressive type to characteristic whiplash type and after 3–4h of incubation, a head-to-head agglutination of spermatozoa was observed which suggested that capacitation was achieved. Heparin treated group showed more head-to-head agglutination pattern compared to control group. In both control and heparin-treated spermatozoa, capacitation was induced in a time-dependent manner over the period of 6h (Fig. 1 ). Within the heparin-treated group the percentage of capacitation increased significantly (P <0.05) after 2h of incubation and this increase remained significantly higher up to 6h of incubation. Whereas, in control group, though the percentage of capacitation increased significantly (P <0.05) after 2h of incubation; but this increase remained non-significant for subsequent periods of incubation. However, within the same observation time, a significantly higher (P <0.05) percentage of capacitation was observed after 6h of incubation in heparin-treated group compared to corresponding control group (50.66±2.6% versus 27.00±2.64%, Fig. 1)."
11,"Effect of heparin, NADPH, and DPI on the rate of O2 − production","3.2 Effect of heparin, NADPH, and DPI on the rate of O2 − production The rate of O2 − production was found to be dependent on the period of incubation (Fig. 2 ). A time-dependent increase was observed up to 6h of incubation. Addition of exogenous SOD inhibited the detectable rate of O2 − production and thus confirmed the specificity of the assay and the identity of O2 − as the reducer of acetylated ferricytochrome c. Within the same observation time, significantly higher (P <0.05) rate of O2 − production was observed after 6h incubation in heparin-treated group compared to corresponding control group (12.90±0.43nmoles/h/108 cells versus 9.1±0.20nmoles/h/108 cells, Fig. 2). However, within both control and heparin-treated group, the increase in the rate of O2 − production was non-significant up to 2h of incubation but significant (P <0.05) after 4h of incubation. When spermatozoa were incubated in the presence of 1mM NADPH, the rate of O2 − production increased instantaneously and significantly (P <0.05) even at 0h compared to untreated group. The rate peaked after 2h of capacitation but afterwards reached a plateau and then remained presumably constant for subsequent periods of incubation. Similar response was also obtained with 5mM NADPH (Fig. 2). However, when spermatozoa were pre-incubated with DPI (10 or 50μM) and subsequently treated with 5mM NADPH, the NADPH-induced O2 − production rate was quenched almost completely. The production rate at all the time periods of incubation decreased significantly (P <0.05) at both concentrations of DPI used in the study compared to sperm+5mM NADPH group (Fig. 2)."
12,Effect of heparin on the rate of H2O2 production,"3.3 Effect of heparin on the rate of H2O2 production Production rate of H2O2 by capacitating spermatozoa in the absence or presence of heparin was determined during different hours of capacitation and the results are shown in Fig. 3 . The rate of H2O2 production increased in time-dependent fashion over the period of incubation both in control and heparin-treated group and suggested that buffalo spermatozoa produced H2O2 continuously during the process of capacitation. Within the same observation time, significantly higher (P <0.05) rates of H2O2 production were observed after 4 and 6h of incubations in heparin-treated groups compared to corresponding control groups (Fig. 3). However, within the heparin-treated group the rate of H2O2 production increased significantly (P <0.05) after 2h of incubation and this increase remained significantly higher up to 6h of incubation. Whereas, in control group, though the rate of H2O2 production increased significantly (P <0.05) after 2h of incubation; but this increase remained non-significant for subsequent periods of incubation. Further, addition of catalase (2100U/mL) to the assay mixture resulted in significant reduction (P <0.05) in the amount of H2O2 detected by the phenol red assay and this strongly indicated the specificity of the assay. In both control and heparin-treated spermatozoa, a significant (P <0.01) positive correlation was observed between the percentage of capacitation and rates of O2 − and H2O2 production across different semen samples and time periods. The Pearson correlations (r) for capacitation percentage versus rate of O2 − production, capacitation percentage versus rate of H2O2 production, and rate of O2 − production versus rate of H2O2 production were 0.934, 0.777 and 0.751, respectively."
13,Discussion,"Heparin induced a significantly higher percentage of capacitation (P <0.05) compared to control group (Fig. 1). It may be noted that sp-TALP (used as control) was also able to induce 27±2.64% capacitation at 6h. Similar observations were also recorded by Suraj and Atreja (2000). This may be attributed to the presence of BSA (6mg/mL) in sp-TALP since BSA-mediated cholesterol efflux from the plasma membrane initiates a signal transduction cascade during capacitation of mammalian spermatozoa (Visconti et al., 1998). Using heparin (10μg/mL) and Bracket and Oliphant (BO) medium Chauhan et al. (1997) had obtained 84.33±1.47% capacitation in buffalo spermatozoa, which seems to be in higher side compared to our findings. This may be attributed to use of Giemsa stain for evaluating percentage of capacitated cells. Giemsa stain was used to stain the acrosomes of spermatozoa and it is not a vital stain and hence might not have differentiated between a live and dead acrosome reacted cells. Further, this group used 10mM Ca2+ to induce AR in capacitated cells. A high molarity Ca2+ might be inducing AR in non-capacitated cells also as has been reported by Kopf et al. (1999). The time period required to attain the capacitative state has been found to be species-dependent (Yanagimachi, 1994). Buffalo spermatozoa required longer time as compared to cattle to achieve the capacitative state and this might be attributed to compositional differences in sperm plasma membrane of these two species (Jain and Anand, 1976). However, the exact mechanism by which heparin induces capacitation in bovine spermatozoa remains obscure. Capacitating buffalo spermatozoa generated O2 − and the rate of production increased in a time-dependent fashion. In the presence of NADPH, there was a sudden burst of O2 − production, and DPI, a covalent binding inhibitor of NADPH-oxidase, inhibited this NADPH-induced O2 − production (Fig. 2). Thus, buffalo spermatozoa produced O2 − continuously during the capacitation process. O2 − generation started immediately at the beginning of the incubation period and continued for the total period of capacitation. Similar findings were also observed in human and rat spermatozoa (de Lamirande and Gagnon, 1995; Aitken et al., 1997; Vernet et al., 2001). de Lamirande and Gagnon (1995) provided direct evidence for production of O2 − by capacitating human spermatozoa using a highly sensitive and specific chemiluminescence probe. Human spermatozoa incubated in the presence of fetal cord serum ultrafiltrate (FCSu, <3kDa, a known inducer of capacitation in human spermatozoa) produced significantly higher SOD-inhibitable chemiluminescence signals compared to control spermatozoa. The production of O2 − started at the beginning of incubation in capacitating conditions and was sustained over more than 4h. Aitken et al. (1997) used the chemiluminescence probes lucigenin and luminol to see the effect of β-NADPH on ROS production. Addition of 500μM β-NADPH to the sperm suspension resulted in 10-fold increase in lucigenin-dependent chemiluminescence signal while addition of SOD led to an immediate quenching of signal indicating the specificity of the O2 − assay. Addition of β-NADPH (over a dose range of 0–5mM) to viable populations of motile spermatozoa induced a sudden dose-dependent increase in the rate of O2 − generation followed by a stabilized new steady state level of production via mechanisms that could be disrupted by DPI. The major advantage of the above chemiluminescence technique is that it was very sensitive and could monitor the ROS production in real time. But, it could not quantify O2 − generation in absolute concentration. Further, the data obtained with this technique could not be compared with the data obtained by other assay methods. DPI inhibited the NADPH-induced O2 − production in buffalo spermatozoa (Fig. 2). DPI is an uncompetitive inhibitor of NADPH-oxidase. It inhibits the enzyme by binding covalently to a 45kDa flavoprotein component of NADPH-oxidase in human neutrophils (O’Donnell et al., 1993). Several workers have reported about the sources of O2 − production. The capacitation-associated increase of the NADPH-oxidase activity in human sperm plasma membrane has been previously suggested (de Lamirande and Gagnon, 1993b). Human sperm NADPH-oxidase is specific for β-isomer of NADPH and is highly sensitive to inhibition by DPI (Aitken et al., 1997). Upon activation by NADPH, NADPH-oxidase produces O2 −, and upon inhibition by DPI, production of O2 − is attenuated. Analysis of O2 − generating system in rat epididymal spermatozoa has revealed that both mitochondria and a plasma membrane NADPH-oxidase are potential sources of O2 − production (Vernet et al., 2001). Leakages from complex I and II of the mitochondrial electron transport chain are also major sources of O2 − production in rat spermatozoa. Plasma membrane NADPH-oxidoreductase of rat epididymal spermatozoa has been partially characterized. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis indicated that rat NADPH-oxidoreductase is quite distinct from its counterpart in neutrophils. Further, the activity of this enzyme was regulated by zinc and uncharacterized cytosolic factors (Vernet et al., 2001). Experiments with NADPH and DPI suggested that buffalo spermatozoa might be having similar O2 − generating systems. Under capacitating conditions, buffalo spermatozoa also produced H2O2 at a significantly higher rate (P <0.05) after 4h of capacitation compared to control spermatozoa (Fig. 3). The rate increased almost linearly in a time-dependent way. Time-dependent production rate of H2O2 in terms of absolute concentration during capacitation has not been reported in any species. However, employing the method of Pick and Keisari (1980) we have been successful in estimating the rate of H2O2 production. Again, this may not be the actual rate of H2O2 production since recovery experiments involving incubation of spermatozoa with a known amount of H2O2 has resulted in lesser yield of H2O2 (unpublished observation). Thus, sperm membrane probably adsorbs some of the extracellularly produced H2O2. Adsorption of H2O2 by rabbit sperm membrane had also been reported by Holland and Storey (1981). Moreover, the pyruvate used in sp-TALP may be scavenging some of the H2O2 produced extracellularly. Thus, detection of H2O2 is difficult in solutions that contain pyruvate or substances that may give rise to pyruvate. Pyruvate reacts directly with H2O2 and yields acetate and CO2 (Tosic and Walton, 1950). Several theories have been proposed for the sources of H2O2. Production of H2O2 by bovine spermatozoa has been attributed to the deamination of aromatic amino acids (Tosic and Walton, 1950). In rabbit spermatozoa, the source of H2O2 generation was attributed to an unidentified low molecular weight component of mitochondria (Holland and Storey, 1981). In human spermatozoa, most of the H2O2 was generated by the action of intracellular SOD on the O2 − (Alvarez et al., 1987). Hence, it is believed that most of the H2O2 is produced by spontaneous and enzymatic dismutation of O2 − by cellular SOD. Otherwise, till now, no evidence has been found for any H2O2 generating system in spermatozoa. Buffalo spermatozoa must be having similar mechanism for H2O2 production since increased intracellular SOD activity has been observed during capacitation of buffalo spermatozoa (Uma, 2004). In conclusion, the present study revealed that buffalo spermatozoa generate O2 − and H2O2 both spontaneously and upon stimulation with capacitation inducer heparin and NADPH. The study also suggested for existence of putative NADPH-oxidase that constitute a specific O2 − generating system in buffalo spermatozoa."
