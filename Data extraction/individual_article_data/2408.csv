0,Introduction,"Nanoscale materials have attracted a great deal of recent attention, because of their sole physical properties, chemical reactivity and potential applications. Metal nanoparticles are especially much better than general catalysts, due to their unique properties, limited size and highly active specific surface area. In particular, palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) have gained much importance due to their high surface-to-volume ratio, high surface energy, and catalytic applications both in heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions (Narayanan and EI-Sayed, 2005). Recently, biogenic-PdNPs have been identified as promising catalysts towards various applications, such as biodegradation (De Windt et al., 2006), dehalogenation (Hennebel et al., 2011) and chromate reduction (Tuo et al., 2013). In practice, the various methods such as physical, chemical and biological methods are used to synthesize metal nanoparticles. The chemical and physical methods are executed with hazardous by-products, expensive chemicals, pressure, energy and temperature. Thus, the low cost, non-toxic and green approaches are required for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles (Kaushik et al., 2010). In recent times, the biological synthesis of metal nanoparticles using plants and microbes has received more attention, as a suitable alternative to other methods. Hence, in the present investigation, the plant extract mediated PdNPs synthesis was considered. Extracts of coffee and tea (Nadagouda and Varma, 2008), Curcuma longa tuber (Sathishkumar et al., 2009), Gardenia jasminoides ellis (Lishan et al., 2009), banana peel (Bankar et al., 2010), Cinnamomum camphora (Yang et al., 2010), and Piper betle (Mallikarjuna et al., 2013) have been used to synthesize PdNPs. Previously, a Coriandrum sativum leaf extract mediated gold nanoparticles synthesized by Narayanan and Sakthivel (2008), who reported that the reduction reaction time of gold ions using C. sativum leaf extract was faster than the microbial mediated synthesis. However, the reduction capability of C. sativum leaf extract for the rapid synthesis of other metal nanoparticles is yet to be fully explored. Therefore, C. sativum leaf extract was used in the present study, to synthesize PdNPs at ambient temperature. Hydrogen is considered a high energy clean fuel (122kJ/g) of the future, and produced only water upon combustion. Hydrogen production from organic substrates and renewable sources by the fermentative process is one of the approaches. In particular, dark fermentation is a more economically viable, low cost, inexhaustible and effective way of converting organic substrates to hydrogen. According to the literature, the low hydrogen yield and production rate are the main challenges for dark fermentative hydrogen production (Kapdan and Kargi, 2006). To overcome these problems, the fermentative hydrogen production process needs to be enhanced, by improving hydrogenase activity via the supplementation of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles. Recent research focused on the development of an efficient fermentative hydrogen production process, by the supplementation of Au (Zhang and Shen, 2007) and hematite nanoparticles (Han et al., 2011). Beckers et al. (2013) investigated the enhancement effect of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles (Pd, Ag, Cu and Fe x O y ), encapsulated with a porous silica matrix on biohydrogen production from glucose using Clostridium butyricum. Recently, our research group reported that the enhancement of green synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles on fermentative hydrogen production using Clostridium acetobutylicum was significantly higher than the ferrous iron (Mohanraj et al., 2014a). To the best of our knowledge, no attempts have been made to develop C. sativum leaf extract mediated synthesis of PdNPs, and its influence on the fermentative hydrogen process using Enterobacter cloacae and mixed culture. In this study, a rapid green synthesis of PdNPs, using C. sativum leaf extract as both reducing and stabilizing agent was developed. The influences of PdCl2 and synthesized PdNPs on fermentative hydrogen production from glucose using E. cloacae and mixed culture were investigated. The obtained experimental data were used to study the kinetic analysis by modified Gompertz equation and to identify the variances by principal component analysis (PCA) for the fermentative hydrogen production process. The metabolic pathways were proposed for the PdCl2 and PdNPs supplemented experiments."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The culture media ingredients including yeast extract, peptone and agar were purchased from HiMedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India. All the chemicals used were of an analytical grade. PdCl2 with a purity of 99% was purchased from Himedia, India. Coriandrum sativum leaves were purchased from the local market, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India."
3,Microorganisms,"2.2 Microorganisms The bacterial strain, E. cloacae 811101 was obtained from the National Institute of Agrobiological Science, Japan. The mixed culture was cultivated from diesel contaminated soil which was collected from the fuel station, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India."
4,Green synthesis of PdNPs using C. sativum leaf extract,"2.3 Green synthesis of PdNPs using C. sativum leaf extract Twenty gram of thoroughly washed C. sativum leaves were finely chopped and boiled in 100mL of sterile double distilled water for 3min. The extract was filtered and stored at 4°C for further experiments. Two millilitres of C. sativum leaf broth were added to 8mL of 1mM palladium chloride solution in a 100mL flask for the synthesis of PdNPs. The flasks were then incubated in a shaker at 150rpm under room temperature (37°C) for 24h. To examine the effect of C. sativum broth on PdNPs formation at 1mM palladium chloride concentration, the addition of C. sativum broth was varied as 1, 2 and 3mL. The effect of the palladium chloride on the synthesis of PdNPs was studied, by varying the concentrations (0.25, 0.5 and 1mM) with 2mL of C. sativum broth (data not shown). The reduction of the palladium (II) ions was monitored over time by the UV–vis spectral analysis. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 11,000rpm for 15min to separate the PdNPs."
5,Effect of palladium nanoparticles on fermentative hydrogen production,"2.4 Effect of palladium nanoparticles on fermentative hydrogen production E. cloacae and mixed culture were separately grown in 25mL of sterilized nutrient broth medium, and kept in a shaking incubator at 37°C for 24h. The experiment for hydrogen production by E. cloacae and mixed culture was conducted in 250mL bottle containing 200mL of the hydrogen producing medium. The composition of the medium was (g/L): 1.5 KH2PO4; 3.2 Na2HPO4; 0.5 NH4Cl; 0.8 MgCl2; 1.0 yeast extract; 0.5 meat extract; 0.5 peptone and 10.0g/L glucose at an initial pH 7.0. The synthesized PdNPs were taken in the range of 5.0–20.0mg/L, to study their effect on hydrogen production. The performance of the fermentative hydrogen production was investigated with PdCl2, PdNPs supplementation and control experiments. The bottle was kept in a magnetic stirrer at 300rpm and room temperature. The headspace air was removed by nitrogen gas to create an anaerobic condition in the bottle. The produced hydrogen was collected in a gas collector using water displacement method. The volume of hydrogen production and glucose utilization were measured at different time intervals."
6,Characterization of palladium nanoparticles,"2.5 Characterization of palladium nanoparticles The morphology of the PdNPs was analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM – JEOL JSM 5610) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM – Tecnai 10; Philips, Netherlands). The size distribution of the synthesized palladium nanoparticles was estimated on the basis of the TEM image by ImageJ 1.45 software. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD – Rigaku Ultima III XRD) was used to analyse the crystallinity of the PdNPs. The UV–vis absorption spectra of PdNPs were observed using a Varian, Cary 100 UV-visible spectrophotometer. The synthesized PdNPs were characterized by the FTIR spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Spectrum RX1)."
7,Analytical methods,"2.6 Analytical methods A gas chromatograph (GC-2014) (Shimadzu Co, Singapore) was used to analyse the composition of biogas, including H2, CO2 and CH4. The gas chromatograph (GC) was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a stainless steel column packed with Porapak Q (80/100 mesh) as described in our previous study (Mohanraj et al., 2014b). The concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and ethanol were determined by the gas chromatograph (GC-2014) (Shimadzu Co., Singapore), equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and Stabilwax-DA capillary column. The concentration of glucose was analysed using the phenol–sulfuric acid method (Dubois et al., 1956)."
8,Kinetic and statistical analysis,"2.7 Kinetic and statistical analysis The modified Gompertz equation was used in this study, to determine the kinetic parameters of fermentative hydrogen production in batch experiments: H = P exp − exp R m e P ( λ − t ) + 1 where H denotes the cumulative volume of hydrogen production (mL); P is the hydrogen production potential (mL); R m represents the maximum hydrogen production rate (mL/h); e is 2.71828; λ is the lag-phase time (h); and t denotes the incubation time (h). The kinetic parameters (P, R m and λ) were estimated by Origin 7.5 (Cappelletti et al., 2011). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to test the effects of PdCl2 and PdNPs on fermentative hydrogen production by E. cloacae and mixed culture. The experimental data were separately analysed for each supplementations. ANOVA analysis was done with the XLSTAT program version 2014.1.04. Post hoc analysis was performed using a Tukey HSD test to investigate the different concentrations of each supplementation (PdCl2 and PdNPs) on fermentative hydrogen production. Furthermore, the Dunnett's test was used to compare the supplementation of PdNPs and PdCl2 experiments with control."
9,Principal component analysis (PCA),"2.8 Principal component analysis (PCA) The principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out to obtain the experimental data using the PAST (Paleontological Statistics software) version 2.13 (Hammer et al., 2001), to detect the similarities and variances of PdCl2 and PdNPs effect on fermentative hydrogen production by E. cloacae and mixed culture. The PCA was used to identify the main sources of variation in soluble metabolites and hydrogen, when the fermentative hydrogen production process was experimented with control and supplementation of palladium (PdCl2 and PdNPs)."
10,Results and discussion,
11,UV–vis spectra,"3.1 UV–vis spectra The formation of PdNPs was observed with the color change and UV–vis spectral analysis. The different concentrations of C. sativum leaf extract (1, 2 and 3mL) on the reduction of Pd2+ ions were monitored by using UV–vis spectroscopy. The addition of 2mL C. sativum leaf extract to 1mM aqueous PdCl2 gradually turned the mixture from brownish yellow to dark brown in 24h due to the excitation of surface plasmon vibrations. The appearance of the dark brown color indicated the formation of PdNPs (supplementary Fig. 1). Similar observations have been reported for the formation of PdNPs, using banana peel extract (Bankar et al., 2010) and C. camphora (Yang et al., 2010). In the present study, UV–vis spectra of PdCl2 showed a distinct peak at around 208nm (Fig. S1). The disappearance of the peak at 208nm was noticed only after the addition of 2mL C. sativum leaf extract. These results indicate that the reduction of Pd (II) ions to Pd (0) was evident, as reported in pervious literature (Patil et al., 2012). 0.25, 0.5 and 1mM concentrations of PdCl2 were separately added to 2mL of C. sativum leaf extract, to investigate the effect of PdCl2 for the formation of PdNPs. It was observed that there was no color change with the addition of 0.25mM, and the light brown color noticed with 0.5mM. In addition, the dark brown color appeared at 1mM concentration of PdCl2. These findings demonstrate that the optimum concentrations of leaf extract and PdCl2 were 2mL and 1mM, respectively. The initial pH of the reaction mixture was 5.6 and it was decreased to 4.1 after 24h. The pH changes indicated that the reaction occurred for the formation of PdNPs. Similarly, Yang et al. (2010) reported that the pH of the reaction mixture (leaf extract and Pd (II)) decreased above 48h, which confirmed the production of H+ ions. Based on the observations, the proposed reaction (Eq. (1)) of PdNPs formation in the present study is given: (1) nPd (II)+2R(OH) n → nPd (0)+2nRO+2nH+"
12,FTIR and XRD analysis,"3.2 FTIR and XRD analysis The FTIR analysis was carried out to identify the different groups present in C. sativum leaf extract, and the possible biomolecules responsible for the reduction of palladium (II) ions. The band intensities in different regions of the spectra for the C. sativum leaf extract and the synthesized PdNPs, are depicted in Fig. 1 a. The FTIR spectrum of the C. sativum leaf extract showed, that the intense absorbance band at 3422cm−1 is the characteristic of OH stretching in alcohols and phenolic compounds. The absorbance bands at 1638cm−1 and 1054cm−1 correspond to amide I and CO, respectively, due to the carbonyl stretch proteins released by the C. sativum leaf extract. The FTIR spectra of the C. sativum leaf extract and synthesized PdNPs revealed that the shift of OH group in polyols and glycosides from 3422cm−1 to 3300cm−1 was oxidized to carboxyl groups, during the reduction of Pd (II) ions to PdNPs. The shift in band from 1638cm−1 to 1644cm−1 indicated the presence of proteins around PdNPs. The similar findings have been reported earlier (Arulkumar and Sabesan, 2010). The results of the study prove that the presence of proteins and polyphenols in the C. sativum leaf extract, were responsible for reducing and capping agents of PdNPs. The XRD analysis showed that the diffraction peaks at 33°, 42°, 55°, 62°, 69° and 73° were indexed to the (002), (110), (112), (200), (004) and (211) planes, respectively. The XRD data matched with the JCPDS standard (card no. 88-2434) (SFig. 2). This result indicates the formation of PdNPs, which is also consistent with the earlier report (Wattanathana et al., 2011)."
13,SEM and TEM analysis,"3.3 SEM and TEM analysis The SEM images of the PdNPs were observed in the micrograph at different magnifications of 4500× and 5000×. The SEM study revealed that the PdNPs were aggregated into larger irregular structures (5000×) and appeared predominantly in rod and spherical shapes (4500×) (SFig. 3a and b). The TEM images show that the PdNPs were mostly spherical in shape, and the average size was found to be 87nm (Fig. 1b). The variations of shape and size of the PdNPs in SEM may be due to the precipitation of PdNPs during the sample preparation. Similarly, the different size and shape of the nanoparticles in SEM analysis were observed by Castro et al. (2010)."
14,Effects of PdCl2 and PdNPs on fermentative hydrogen production by E. cloacae,"3.4 Effects of PdCl2 and PdNPs on fermentative hydrogen production by E. cloacae The fermentative hydrogen production with time course using E. cloacae in the control (without supplementation) and the palladium supplemented experiments (PdCl2 and PdNPs) are illustrated in Fig. 2a. The hydrogen production in the control experiment was 357±12mL (Mohanraj et al., 2014b). In the PdCl2 supplemented experiments, the hydrogen production was significantly decreased from 336±19 to 231±13mL, by varying the PdCl2 concentration from 5.0 to 20.0mg/L (P <0.01). On the other hand, the maximum hydrogen production of 362±11mL (P >0.05) was obtained with 5.0mg/L of PdNPs supplementation. Further, it was slightly decreased to 347±12mL (P >0.05) with the increase of the PdNPs concentration up to 20mg/L (Fig. 2a). The hydrogen production in the PdCl2 experiments was significantly (P <0.01) lower than that of the control, whereas the hydrogen production in the PdNPs supplemented experiment was almost similar (P >0.05) to the control. Among these palladium supplemented experiments (PdCl2 and PdNPs), the glucose conversion efficiency was decreased from 99 to 77%, when the supplementation of PdCl2 concentration was varied from 5.0 to 20.0mg/L (Fig. 2c). It was evidently observed that the addition of PdCl2 showed an inhibitory effect on fermentative hydrogen production by E. cloacae. However, the glucose conversion was performed well by the addition of PdNPs, and the conversion efficiency was almost similar to the control experiment. The supplementation of nano-sized palladium did not affect the bioactivity of E. cloacae, but there was insignificant enhancement effect on fermentative hydrogen production. The effects of PdCl2 and PdNPs on the hydrogen yield and hydrogen content by E. cloacae are given in Fig. 2b. As can be seen in Fig. 2b, the hydrogen yields of 1.39±0.07 and 1.48±0.04mol H2/mol glucose were obtained at 5.0mg/L of PdCl2 and PdNPs supplementation, respectively. In addition, the hydrogen yield was gradually decreased with the increase of PdCl2 concentration from 5.0 to 20.0mg/L, but it fluctuated during the fermentation process with the supplementation of the same PdNPs concentration. A similar trend was observed in the hydrogen content, which is presented in Fig. 2b. The obtained hydrogen production data were used to fit the modified Gompertz equation, and the estimated kinetic parameters are given in Table 1 . The PdCl2 supplemented experiments showed that the hydrogen production rate and lag phase time were lower than that of the control. On the other hand, the PdNPs supplemented experiments exhibited that the maximum hydrogen production rate of 32.33mL/h was obtained at 5.0mg/L of PdNPs. The hydrogen production rate was almost constant up to 10.0mg/L, and it fluctuated at 15.0 and 20.0mg/L of PdNPs addition. Furthermore, the lowest lag phase time of 7.9h was found at 5.0mg/L of PdNPs and the lag phase time fluctuated above 5.0mg/L. The PdNPs supplemented fermentation showed higher hydrogen production than that of the control and PdCl2 supplemented experiments (Fig. 2c). From these findings, the PdNPs supplemented experiments exhibited insignificant increase in the hydrogen production when compared to the control, whereas the same experiments produced significantly higher hydrogen (P <0.05) than the PdCl2 supplemented experiments. The effects of PdCl2 and PdNPs on volatile fatty acid with ethanol concentration are depicted in Table 1. The formation of VFA and ethanol were influenced by the addition of palladium (PdNPs and PdCl2). The major soluble metabolites produced using E. cloacae were in the order of acetate>butyrate>ethanol>propionate in control experiment. Among the produced metabolites, butyrate concentration was gradually increased with an increase of the PdCl2 from 5.0 to 20mg/L. Propionate was moderately increased in all the concentrations of PdCl2, when compared to the control experiment. The acetate and ethanol concentrations were relatively lower than that of the control and they were fluctuated at the addition above 5.0mg/L of PdCl2. On the contrary, a higher concentration of acetate, with a fairly lower concentration of other metabolites, was observed by the addition of PdNPs, when compared to the control. The PdNPs supplemented experiments indicated that the high acetate concentration (759±8mg/L) was observed at 5.0mg/L of PdNPs. Further, the acetate concentration was fluctuated at the supplementation above 5.0mg/L of PdNPs. This is in good agreement with the hydrogen production data, as shown in Fig. 2c. The high hydrogen production was associated with acetate by the supplementation of PdNPs at 5.0mg/L, whereas a low hydrogen production was associated with butyrate and propionate by the supplementation of PdCl2. Previously, Hawkes et al. (2002) stated that the high hydrogen content associated with acetate and butyrate and low hydrogen content combined with the other metabolites like propionate and ethanol. In PdCl2 supplemented experiments, the acetate formation was gradually inhibited and propionate formation was slowly activated. The formation of propionate was unfavourable for hydrogen production because it consumed the hydrogen. The results demonstrated that the supplementation of PdCl2 influenced the metabolic profile of E. cloacae."
15,Effects of PdCl2 and PdNPs on fermentative hydrogen production by mixed culture,"3.5 Effects of PdCl2 and PdNPs on fermentative hydrogen production by mixed culture The effects of PdCl2 and PdNPs on fermentative hydrogen production from glucose by mixed culture are shown in Fig. 3a and b. The maximum hydrogen production and hydrogen yield in the control experiment were 453±26mL and 2.33±0.13mol H2/mol glucose, respectively. On the contrary, the maximum hydrogen production and hydrogen yield in the PdCl2 supplemented experiments were significantly lower than (P <0.01) that of the control experiment. In PdNPs supplemented experiments, the hydrogen production and hydrogen yield were 494±18mL and 2.48±0.09mol H2/mol glucose at 5.0mg/L of PdNPs, respectively and the obtained results were insignificantly (P >0.05) higher than the control. Further, the hydrogen yield fluctuated above 5.0mg/L of PdNPs supplementation, but it gradually decreased with the same increase of the PdCl2 concentrations. These findings demonstrate that the low hydrogen production and hydrogen yields were obtained by the addition of PdCl2 at all concentrations. It was evident that the glucose conversion efficiency slowly decreased (78–61%) with the increase in the PdCl2 concentration from 5.0 to 20.0mg/L, when compared to the control and PdNPs experiments (Fig. 3c). The PdCl2 supplemented experiment at 5.0mg/L showed that the fermentative hydrogen production was 389±21mL and the maximum hydrogen content was 31%, which was remarkably lower than that of the control (34%). Moreover, the addition of PdNPs revealed that the hydrogen content was 35% at 5.0mg/L. The experimental data of hydrogen production were analysed by the modified Gompertz equation to determine the kinetic parameters (P, R m and λ), which are presented in Table 2 . The hydrogen production rate was relatively decreased with the increase in the PdCl2 concentrations from 5.0 to 20.0mg/L. The low hydrogen production rate and high lag phase time were estimated by the addition of PdCl2 at all concentrations. On the other hand, the maximum hydrogen production rate was 46.6mL/h at 5.0 and 20.0mg/L with PdNPs supplementation. The hydrogen production rate fluctuated at 10.0 and 15.0mg/L of PdNPs. Additionally, the low lag phase time of 9.3h was noticed at 5.0mg/L of PdNPs supplementation. However, the lag phase time was increased up to 20.0mg/L, when the addition of the palladium nanoparticles concentration was above 5.0mg/L. These findings indicate that the hydrogen production at 5.0mg/L of PdNPs supplementation was relatively higher, than that of the control and PdCl2 supplemented experiments. Table 2 shows the effect of PdCl2 and PdNPs on volatile fatty acid with ethanol concentration for the fermentative process, by mixed culture. The major soluble metabolites produced by mixed culture were in the order of acetate>butyrate>ethanol>propionate in control experiment. The obtained acetate concentration by the supplementation of PdCl2 was relatively lower and the concentrations of propionate and ethanol were noticeably increased when compared to the control experiment. These findings suggest that the shift in the metabolic pathway during the fermentation process may affect the hydrogen production. Similar results were found by Vavilin et al. (1995). In the present study, the hydrogen production was inhibited by the addition of PdCl2 due to the formation of propionate concentration. On the contrary, the PdNPs supplemented experiments demonstrated that the ethanol and acetate concentration were higher than that of the control, when compared to butyrate and propionate. It was also noted that the concentrations of butyrate and propionate were found to be low in the PdNPs supplemented fermentation process. These results confirm that the supplementation of PdNPs influenced the metabolites formation using mixed culture, to produce notably high acetate and ethanol concentration. However, the formation of propionate was gradually suppressed by the addition of PdNPs."
16,Comparative studies of fermentative hydrogen production by E. cloacae and mixed culture,"3.6 Comparative studies of fermentative hydrogen production by E. cloacae and mixed culture The hydrogen yields of E. cloacae and mixed culture were 1.39±0.07 and 2.11±0.11mol H2/mol glucose, respectively at 5.0mg/L of PdCl2 and they were observed to be significantly (P <0.05) lower than those of the control experiments. It was found that the addition of PdCl2 was not favourable for the enhancement of biohydrogen production using E. cloacae. But, the previous study on fermentative hydrogen production using E. cloacae by the additions of iron showed enhancement effect. It was reported that the maximum hydrogen yields from glucose using E. cloacae were 1.7±0.017 and 2.07±0.07mol H2/mol glucose by 25mg/L of FeSO4 and 125mg/L of FeNPs supplementation, respectively (Mohanraj et al., 2014b). Based on the soluble metabolites profile, the possible pathways were proposed for palladium supplementation (PdCl2 and PdNPs) on fermentative hydrogen production from glucose (Fig. 4a and b). In Fig. 4a, the produced hydrogen may act as an electron donor for the reduction of Pd (II) ions into Pd (0) using hydrogenase, as reported by Deplanche et al. (2010) and Hennebel et al. (2011). They stated that the hydrogenase plays a crucial role with the help of hydrogen as an electron donor in the reduction of Pd (II) ions to Pd (0). Another reason for low hydrogen yield in the PdCl2 supplemented experiments, the notable formation of propionate was increased; nevertheless the formation of propionate consumed the produced hydrogen (Eq. (2)). Moreover, the butyrate (Eq. (3)) and propionate fermentation type were activated whereas the acetate and ethanol were inhibited in the PdCl2 supplemented fermentative processes of E. cloacae and mixed culture. Thus, the inhibitory effect on hydrogenase activity and changes in the metabolic pathway may lead to a low hydrogen yield in the PdCl2 supplemented experiments: (2) C6H12O6 +2H2 →2CH3CH2COOH+2H2O (3) C6H12O6 +2H2O→CH3CH2CH2COOH+2CO2 +2H2 In PdNPs supplemented experiments, the hydrogen yields of E. cloacae and mixed culture were 1.48±0.04 and 2.48±0.09mol H2/mol glucose, respectively, by the addition of PdNPs at 5.0mg/L. The hydrogen production of E. cloacae and mixed culture was insignificantly (P >0.05) higher than those of the control experiments. However, the hydrogen yield of mixed culture in the PdNPs supplemented experiments was significantly (P <0.05) higher than that of the E. cloacae. Also, the obtained hydrogen yield from glucose using mixed culture was comparatively higher than that of the literature value, as reported by Beckers et al. (2013), who found that the maximum hydrogen yield of 1.08±0.06mol H2/mol glucose using a mixed culture with the addition of iron oxide nanoparticles encapsulated with porous silica catalysts (10−6 molL−1). As a result, the nano-sized Pd showed higher catalytic activity towards the enhancement of fermentative hydrogen production when compared to the bulk material (PdCl2). Similarly, Deplanche et al. (2010) and Hennebel et al. (2011) found that the PdNPs exhibited higher catalytic behaviour than Pd (II) ions in the fermentative process. The possible reason for the improvement of the hydrogen yield may be owing to increase the activity of hydrogenase, in the presence of nanosized Pd particles. On the other hand, the addition of PdNPs suppressed the propionate and butyrate formation but, the acetate/ethanol formation was activated. Thus, the fermentative processes of E. cloacae and mixed culture were considered as the acetate (Eq. (4)) and acetate/ethanol (Eq. (5)) fermentation type, respectively. In Fig. 4b, the propionate and butyrate formation were inhibited, whereas the acetate and acetate/ethanol formation were increased in E. cloacae and mixed culture fermentation, respectively. According to the theoretical yield, high hydrogen yield was associated with acetate fermentation type (Eq. (4)), while the formation of 2 mole of hydrogen is consumed by 2 mole of propionate in propionate fermentation type (Eq. (2)) (De Amorim et al., 2012). (4) C6H12O6 +2H2O→2CH3COOH+2CO2 +4H2 (5) C6H12O6 +2H2O→CH3CH2OH+CH3COOH+2H2 +2CO2 The results of the present study prove that the supplementation of PdCl2 and PdNPs showed significant influence on soluble metabolites profile and thus led to change in hydrogen production."
17,Principal component analysis,"3.7 Principal component analysis The hydrogen yield and soluble metabolites profile data of the control, PdCl2 and PdNPs supplemented experiments by E. cloacae and mixed culture were utilized for the analysis of the principal components, in two-dimensional plots of PC1 against PC2, which are depicted in Fig. 5a and b. The fermentative hydrogen production from glucose using E. cloacae experimental results were represented as a bi-plot of PC1 against PC2, and showed approximately 99%, variances in the data set (Fig. 5a). The ethanol, butyrate, acetate and hydrogen were positively correlated with PC1, whereas propionate, ethanol and butyrate were positively correlated with PC2. The butyrate and ethanol were closely associated with the control, whereas acetate and hydrogen were linked with PdNPs supplementation. The propionate was associated with PdCl2 supplemented experiments. Also, the formation of propionate was negatively correlated with hydrogen and acetate, thus the propionate affected the hydrogen production. The PCA method was clearly elaborated by Moon et al. (2013). On the other hand, the fermentative hydrogen production from glucose using mixed culture was represented as a bi-plot of PC1 against PC2, and showed approximately 99%, variances in the data set (Fig. 5b). Hydrogen, acetate and ethanol were positively correlated with PC1, whereas butyrate and ethanol were positively correlated with PC2. The high level variances of hydrogen and acetate vectors were positioned in PdNPs supplemented experiments. The butyrate was oppositely positioned to hydrogen and acetate vectors. This result indicates that the butyrate formation led to decrease the hydrogen and acetate production. The vector of propionate was negatively correlated to ethanol. As a result, the formation of both ethanol and propionate affected the hydrogen production, as stated by Hawkes et al. (2002)."
18,Conclusions,"An environmental friendly route for the green synthesis of palladium nanoparticles was developed, using C. sativum leaf extract. The fermentative hydrogen production using E. cloacae and mixed culture was inhibited by the additions of PdCl2, whereas the fermentative hydrogen production using mixed culture was significantly enhanced by the additions of PdNPs. The results of the study confirm that the supplemented PdNPs influenced the metabolic pathway towards high yield of hydrogen. Also, the additions of PdNPs may not be suitable to achieve the theoretical yield of fermentative hydrogen production."
