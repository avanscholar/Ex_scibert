0,Introduction,"The conventional hydrogen production technology today is steam reformation of natural gas (SMR). The process requires steam at high temperatures and significant amount of heat for operation [1]. In addition the process produces CO and CO2 gases and requires multiple additional steps to remove the CO (WGS reactor) and the CO2 (PSA) to increase yield and purify the hydrogen [2]. These processes add complexity to the reforming system and increase the hydrogen cost. ECD has developed a new technology to produce hydrogen termed Ovonic Renewable Hydrogen (ORH). ORH uses alkaline materials as reactant to facilitate the reforming of organic matters to hydrogen [3]. The reforming is a one-step process and operates at significant lower temperatures (130–300°C) compared to conventional steam reforming or gasification processes (800–1000°C). ORH process does not form CO or CO2 gases and therefore pure hydrogen is formed at high yields without the need for WGS and PSA [4]. The only by-product formed is carbonate salt which can easily be separated and reacted to regenerate the base material (NaOH) using the well known pulp and paper Kraft process. The ORH process has been demonstrated in ECD's laboratories on wide range of fuels including renewable liquid fuels, biomass and waste materials. This presentation will describe the ORH technology and its advantages with respect to conventional steam reforming and gasification processes and will present data from reformation of liquid fuels and solid biomass feedstocks. ORH reactor can be scaled down to sizes suitable for production of hydrogen in a distributed manner with a projected cost of hydrogen lower than conventional technology. ECD intends to further develop the technology toward commercialization."
1,Ovonic Renwable Hydrogen (ORH),
2,Process description,"2.1 Process description The ORH process is based on reaction of base (i.e. NaOH, KOH etc.) with an organic fuel in contrast to a conventional steam reforming (SR) or gasification which is based on reaction of water (steam) with the organic fuel to form hydrogen. The alteration of the reaction by using base results in different by-products formed along with the hydrogen gas and in more favorable thermodynamic properties. A schematic representation comparing the ORH and conventional steam reforming processes is shown in Fig. 1 . In the ORH process, the base material is reacting with the fuel to form pure hydrogen and a solid carbonate by-product. This is in contrast to the conventional steam reforming where steam at high temperature is reacting with the fuel to form a mixture of gases which include CO and CO2 in addition to hydrogen. The chemistry associated with the ORH process is described in the following equations and compared to steam reforming (SR) process for various fuels as examples: Methane (CH4) CH4 +2NaOH+H2O↔Na2CO3 +4H2 ORH CH4 +2H2O↔CO2 +4H2 SR Methanol (CH3OH) CH3OH+2NaOH↔Na2CO3 +3H2 ORH CH3OH+H2O↔CO2 +3H2 SR Glycerol (C3H5(OH)3) C3H5(OH)3 +6NaOH↔3Na2CO3 +7H2 ORH C3H5(OH)3 +3H2O↔3CO2 +7H2 SR Cellulose (C6H10O5)n (C6H10O5)n +12nNaOH+nH2O↔6nNa2CO3 +12nH2 ORH (C6H10O5)n +7nH2O↔6nCO2 +12nH2 SR In the ORH reforming the hydrogen is produced in a one-step process. In contrast, the steam reforming (SR) is a multi-step process where carbon monoxide (CO) is formed in the first stage of the reaction. The CO is then reacted in the second stage, the water-gas shift reaction (WGS), to form carbon dioxide (CO2) and additional hydrogen. Hydrogen is then separated from the CO2 by the pressure swing absorption (PSA) process. An example of the different stages of the steam reforming process is shown for methane fuel below: CH 4 +H 2 O ↔ CO+3H 2 CO+H 2 O ↔ CO 2 +H 2 Gas Shift CH 4 + 2H 2 O ↔ CO 2 +4H 2 PSA Block diagrams representations of steam reforming and ORH processes are shown in Figs. 2 below."
3,Process thermodynamics,"2.2 Process thermodynamics In addition to the ORH process being a simpler process, it also operates at lower temperatures and requires less heat for operation. This is due to its more favorable thermodynamics compared to steam reforming reaction. Table 1 compares some of the thermodynamic parameters of the ORH and SR processes for several fuels. As the table shows, the Gibbs free energies (ΔG°) of the ORH reactions are lower than that of the SR reactions for the different fuels indicating lower temperatures of reformation in the ORH process. In cases of oxygenated hydrocarbon such as methanol and ethanol, negative Gibb's free energy indicates possibility of reforming at room temperature in a liquid phase. The standard heat of reaction (enthalpy) are also lower in the cases of the ORH process, indicating lower heat requirement and thus higher thermal efficiency for conducting the ORH reformation reactions. In some cases, such as methanol, glucose and cellulose, an endothermic reaction (positive heat of reaction) in conventional steam reforming becomes exothermic (negative heat of reaction) in the ORH reformation reaction. The more favorable thermodynamics of the ORH reforming is reflected in yield of conversion of the fuels to H2 at equilibrium as calculated from the equilibrium constants. Equilibrium constants for the conventional steam reforming (to produce H2 and CO2) and the ORH reforming (to produce H2 and Na2CO3) were calculated at different temperatures for various fuels using FactSage thermodynamic software. As Fig. 3 (a–c) shows, conversion of the fuels to H2 occurs in the cases of the ORH reforming at significantly lower temperatures than with the conventional steam reforming. When all other possible reactions are allowed besides the reaction to produce H2 and CO2 in the case of conventional steam reforming or H2 and Na2CO3 in the case of the ORH, one can see that the conventional steam reforming forms also CO in the reforming temperatures normally used. Fig. 4 shows the composition of the products at equilibrium predicted for conventional steam reforming (a) and ORH reforming (b) of ethanol. The composition was found by minimizing the Gibb's free energy taking in consideration all possible products using FactSage thermodynamic software. In the case of the conventional steam reforming, CO and not CO2 is the thermodynamically dominant by-product at the high temperature of reformation. Water Gas shift reaction (WGS) is further needed to complete the reforming to obtain a maximum yield of hydrogen while forming CO2. In the case of ORH reformation of ethanol (Fig. 4(b)), a maximum yield of hydrogen is predicted at low temperature while a full oxidation of the carbon to Na2CO3 by-product is obtained. The base facilitated reforming reaction not only occurs at significantly lower temperatures than the conventional steam reforming reaction, it is also a simpler one step reaction as opposed to the steam reforming reaction which is a multistep process. The Ovonic Renewable Hydrogen (ORH) reforming is also thermally more efficient than the conventional steam reforming because of its lower heat of reaction (enthalpy), ΔHrxn. The thermal efficiency of the methanol reforming reactions for example can be written as [5]): E eff =3*LHV H 2 / ( LHV CH 3 OH +ΔH rxn ) Where LHV are the lower heating values of the respective molecules and ΔHrxn is the heat of the reforming reactions. Calculation shows that the ideal efficiency for steam reformation of methanol is 94% and it is 121% for the ORH reformation, because of the lower ΔHrxn of this process. Even higher thermal efficiency is calculated for ORH reformation of cellulose because of its high exothermal. E eff =12*LHV H 2 / ( LHV C 6 H 10 O 5 +ΔH rxn ) and ideal efficiencies of 90% and 153% are calculated for steam and ORH of cellulose reformation respectively."
4,Test results of reforming in the ORH process,"ECD has demonstrated the ORH process in variety of liquid or solid fuels. Examples of fuels which were successfully reformed using the ORH process are: Alcohols: Methanol, Ethanol, Crude Ethanol, E95, Ethylene Glycol, Glycerol (from bio-diesel plant) Sugars: Glucose, Fructose, Starch (Cornstarch, Potato starch) Fossil Fuels: Coal Biomass: Grass, Sawdust, Woodchips, Corn, Potato Peels, Cellulose, Hemicelluloses (Xylan from Beachwood), Lignin (Organosolv) Municipal Solid Waste: Paper, foodwaste Some of the fuels reformed using the ORH process is shown in Fig. 5 below: In all cases reformation using the ORH process occurred at significantly lower temperatures than the counterpart SR of the same fuels. Data from Reformation of some liquid fuels and solid biomass feedtocks are described below:"
5,Liquid fuels,"3.1 Liquid fuels Liquid fuels such as methanol, ethanol and glycerol could be reformed at temperatures low enough so that reforming in liquid phase was possible. In liquid phase reforming, the fuel and water are in a liquid phase and the alkaline material dissolves into the liquid. In order for the reaction to proceed at appreciable rate, a catalyst is needed. ECD identified number of catalysts which are non-noble in nature and allow the ORH reactions to proceed at high rates. Fig. 6 shows the effect of catalyst on ORH reforming of methanol (6a) and ethanol (6b) in the liquid phase. The reactions described in these figures were conducted in a batch reactor at a temperature of 130°C. The volume of hydrogen gas at standard conditions, generated as a function of time is shown. As one can see, the reactions are catalytic in nature and the type of catalyst used has a significant effect on the reaction rate. It is interesting to note that the effect of different catalysts on the rate of the reaction of methanol and ethanol is different. As the figure shows, catalyst B (Raney nickel 2400 from Aldrich) exhibits the highest reaction rate in the case of methanol reformation but shows the lowest catalytic activity for ethanol reformation. Catalysts A (Raney nickel 2800 from Aldrich) and C (Raney nickel 5601 from W. R. Grace) which exhibit lowest activity in the case of methanol reforming, showed highest reformation rate of ethanol. Ethanol reformation is associated with breaking a C–C bond which is known to be difficult to achieve while methanol oxidation is not associated with breaking of such bond. The results indicate that catalysts A and C are better catalysts to enhance breaking of C–C bond [6]. The operating temperature has also a large effect on the rate of the ORH base facilitated reformation. As Fig. 7 shows, the reformation rates of methanol and ethanol increase with increasing the temperature. The increase in rate is about two times for increase of 10°C in temperature corresponding to activation energy of about 30Kcal/mole. Reformation in the liquid phase of alcohols having multiple alcohol functionality such as ethylene glycol and glycerol was also studied using the ORH reformation process. Fig. 8 shows result of glycerol reformation in a batch reactor. The H2 yield obtained in the reformation was close to 100% and the glycerol reacted close to completion."
6,Solid biomass and waste materials,"3.2 Solid biomass and waste materials ECD has also studied reformation of solid biomass and waste materials using the ORH reforming process. While gasification of biomass materials to produce hydrogen takes place at high temperatures of 800–1000°C, the ORH process produced hydrogen from biomass at temperatures of <340°C. In addition, biomass gasification, like steam reforming produces mixture of gases which include H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 and requires additional steps to increase hydrogen yield (WGS) and purify the hydrogen (PSA). In contrast, the ORH process yielded highly purity hydrogen (∼99%) with a yield close to 100% from raw unpurified biomass feedstock's in one-step reaction. Sodium carbonate is the only by-product of this process. It can easily be separated and converted back to the base NaOH material using the Kraft process applied in the pulp and paper industry. Fig. 9 shows results of ORH reformation of different biomass and waste materials at 260°C in a batch reactor. Hydrogen yields of 50–60% have been obtained with ∼99% purity with CH4 being the only impurity. At higher temperatures, conversion efficiency approaching 100% could be obtained as seen in Fig. 10 for ORH reformation of wood. Separate experiments show that high conversion yields are achieved with the components of biomass feedstocks namely cellulose (powder ∼20 microns from Sigma-Aldrich), hemicellulose (Xylan, derived from Beechwood, from Sigma) and lignin (Organosolv from Aldrich) using the ORH process. This is shown in Fig. 11 . As the figure shows, the reformation of the individual components was close to completion with hydrogen yield at 340°C approaching 100%. High rate of reaction is achieved with residence times of 5–20min."
7,Carbonate recycling,"In the ORH process, carbonate salt (Na2CO3) is obtained as the byproduct along with the hydrogen gas. All the carbon of the feedstock is captured in the carbonate and therefore its disposal (or sale for various industrial applications) is an optional way to sequester the carbon making the ORH process environmentally clean. Alternatively for a more economic process the sodium carbonate can be reacted with Ca(OH)2 to regenerate the sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as in the well known Kraft process used in the paper mill industry. The chemistry of this process is described in equations (1)–(3) below: (1) Na2CO3 +Ca(OH)2 ↔ 2NaOH+CaCO3 (2) CaCO3 ↔ CaO+CO2 (3) CaO+H2O ↔ Ca(OH)2 The NaOH generated in step (1) is reused in the reforming process. If desired, The CaCO3 can be calcined (step 2) and then hydrated (step 3) to regenerate the Ca(OH)2. In this case neither NaOH nor Ca(OH)2 is consumed in the presence. The CO2 generated is pure and can be used for various industrial applications."
8,Economics of ORH process,"Economic evaluation of the ORH process using the H2A economic analysis tool developed by Department of Energy (DOE) was conducted. H2A uses the following conditions and input sources: ▪ Net present value with Internal Rate of Return (IRR): 10% ▪ 20 years depreciation on facility equipment ▪ 10 years depreciation on reactor ▪ Cost of feedstock and electricity taken from Energy Information Administration (EIA) Annual Energy Outlook report. Analysis showed that the cost of hydrogen produced using the ORH process is highly sensitive to the cost of the feedstock used. The lowest cost is obtained when biomass is used as the feedstock. Fig. 12 shows the cost structure calculated for ORH H2 production using biomass. A cost of ∼$2.00/Kg-H2 is projected for a plant that produces 1,500/Kg per day H2 For comparison, the cost of hydrogen using ethanol and methanol as fuels was calculated to be $2.50/kg and $3.60/kg respectively. In these calculations, the cost of recycling the sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) by-product was taken into consideration. The cost of producing hydrogen from biomass is very competitive with the DOE goal of $2–$3/kg and with the current cost of delivered (merchant) hydrogen (>$10/kg)."
9,Conclusions,We have demonstrated the Ovonic Renewable Hydrogen (ORH) process on variety of fuels and showed the advantage of the technology with respect to conventional steam reformation and gasification processes. Liquid fuels have been reformed in their liquid state to high purity hydrogen in one-step reaction. Solid biomass and waste materials have been reformed at temperatures of ∼300°C significantly lower than the temperatures required for biomass gasification and without generation of CO and CO2 gases. High conversion of raw biomass feedstock in unpurified state was obtained using the ORH process with high hydrogen yield approaching 100%. The ORH is an economically feasible process.
