0,Introduction,"Today, the use of fossil fuel is not only threatening the global climate, but its depletion is also a major issue in global energy security. Therefore, the world needs a swift transition to renewable energy in order to supplement the fossil resources. Renewable energy, particularly lignocellulosic biomass is an affordable alternative and could play a significant role in improving the environment, create a bio-economy and increase energy security (Saxena et al., 2009). Lignocellulosic biomass is mainly comprised of three valuable components namely cellulose (38–50 %), hemicellulose (23–32 %) and lignin (15–25 %) (Behling et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2019). Lignin is the most valuable component of lignocellulosic biomass, consisting of three aromatic alcohols: sinapyl, coniferyl and p-coumaryl alcohol (Liu et al., 2019). These alcohol units are bonded with each other by various CO, and CC linkages such as β-O-4, β-5, β–β, 4-O-5, 5–5 or β-1 which vary with pre-treatment steps and source of biomass (Hu et al., 2018). In lignin, β-O-4 ether linkages are the most common linkages, which vary from 50 % in softwood lignin to 65 % in hardwood lignin (Barbieri et al., 2019). It was observed that the paper and pulp industry generated huge amounts of lignin as a by-product (Bajwa et al., 2019; Bruijnincx and Weckhuysen, 2014). Among which, 98 % is burnt as a source of energy due to its high calorific value. Only less than 2 % lignin is used for high-value applications such as phenolic resins, polyurethane foams and wood panel product etc. (Stewart, 2008; Behling et al., 2016). The poor commercialization of lignin into valuable products is due to its complex macro polymeric structure and uncontrolled breaking of lignin. Researchers have used various catalytic and non-catalytic thermochemical methods for the valorization of lignin such as combustion (Gani and Naruse, 2007; Réti et al., 2008), gasification (Blasio et al., 2019; Kang et al., 2013), liquefaction (Kang et al., 2013; Erdocia et al., 2015), pyrolysis (Liu et al., 2018, 2016), base-catalysed depolymerization (Toledano et al., 2012, 2014), hydrogenolysis (Vangeel et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2018) and oxidation (Liu et al., 2019) etc. Breaking of lignin macromolecule into selective valuable compounds is a challenge due to its high rate of recombination and repolymerization of broken active monomer radicals of lignin. Hence, there is a need to develop a suitable method for the production of selective valuable compounds during lignin depolymerization. The oxidative lignin depolymerization under mild operating condition is one of the most promising routes due to the production of highly functionalized chemicals (Abdelaziz et al., 2019). Oxidative depolymerization is generally carried out using an oxidizing agent such as molecular oxygen (Deng et al., 2015), hydrogen peroxide (Shilpy et al., 2015), and tempo (Gharehkhani et al., 2019) etc. The bond cleavage during depolymerization varies from one oxidizing agent to another, due to their specific functionality towards bond breaking. The use of hydrogen peroxide is the right choice, as it is a green oxidizing agent, and converts into water as a by-product during the reaction. Ouyang et al., reported the degree of depolymerization of wheat alkali lignin using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing agent. They treated lignin in different solvents (methanol, 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, ethanol, and their co-solvent) using CuO/Fe2(SO4)3/NaOH as catalyst. They observed that water-methanol solvent mixture effectively depolymerized the lignin and showed a maximum of 90.2 % degree of depolymerization of wheat alkali lignin with 16 ml methanol and 4 ml water solvent mixture. Maximum yield of monophenolic products (17.8 %) including vanillin, vanillic acid, acetovanillone, syringaldehyde and acetosyringone etc. were observed with 10 ml methanol and 10 ml water (Ouyang et al., 2016). Mottweiler et al., studied the oxidation of lignin, and β-O-4 lignin model compounds in the presence of peroxides. At first, they performed the oxidation of benzylic model compound using (TBHP) tert-butyl hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing agent with 5 mol% of FeCl3 in pyridine at 82 °C/24 h. They noticed 43 % conversion of the model compound with the production of ketone as the main product. The conversion increased to 57 % when Fe-DABCO was used as the catalyst. In the case of H2O2, the conversion was 10 % with the formation of 3,4-dimethoxy benzaldehyde (5 %). When DMSO was used in place of pyridine, the conversion of model compound increased to 41 % in the presence of Fe-DABCO catalyst. They also observed that the conversion of benzylic model compound increased to 84 % with an increase in temperature to 100 °C with 20 % production of aldehyde and 11 % of ketone. They also examined the degradation of organosolv, and kraft lignin by taking 5% of Fe-DABCO catalyst at 100 °C for 8 h, and confirmed the β-O-4 bond breaking of lignin by using 2D-NMR-HSQC (Mottweiler et al., 2015). Tana et al., studied the valorization of native lignin of sugarcane bagasse using molecular oxygen and alcohol (methanol and ethanol) in the presence of Pd/C catalyst at 250 °C for different reaction times ranging from 0.5–8 h. They observed a maximum of 87.5 wt.% liquid product yield with methanol at 250 °C/8 h. The GCMS analysis of bio-oil showed maximum 55 % of ester selectivity at 8 h (Tana et al., 2019). Lin and his co-workers studied the catalytic oxidation of corncob lignin of bio-refinery using MeCN/H2O in the presence of ZrCl2 and NaOH as the co-catalyst and molecular oxygen as an oxidizing agent. They observed that non-catalytic reaction showed 10.9 % conversion of corncob lignin, while it was 19.9 % with ZrCl2 catalyst with the production of 5.9 wt.% monomeric yield. The conversion rate of lignin in the presence of ZrCl2/NaOH was found to be 42.3 %. The GCMS analysis of the liquid product showed the presence of two major aromatic aldehydes: vanillin and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (Lin et al., 2019). In the present research, the depolymerization of prot lignin was carried out using different amounts (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 3.0 and 5.0 ml) of 30 % H2O2 in water-ethanol co-solvent mixture at an optimum temperature of 120 °C with 30 min residence time. Lignin was characterized using XRD, TGA, FT-IR. The bio-oil was analysed by FT-IR, 1H-NMR, GC–MS, and char residue was characterized using TOC. The plausible mechanism for the formation of valuable compounds due to different amounts of hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen and nitrogen atmosphere has been proposed."
1,Materials and methods,"Lignin was purchased from Asian Lignin Manufacturing ™ (ALM) in the form of Protobind ™ 1000 (pH 3–3.5, specific gravity 1.1–1.12), a renewable product obtained from the agricultural fibrous feedstock. Hydrogen peroxide was procured from LOBA Chemie in the form of 30 % H2O2. The ethanol was purchased from Fisher-Scientific, and the double distilled water was prepaerd in lab."
2,Characterization techniques,"2.1 Characterization techniques The thermo-gravimetric analysis of feed was carried out using Shimadzu DTG-60 instrument, and HR-83 Mettler Toledo Halogen Moisture Analyser was used for the detection of moisture content of prot lignin. Shimadzu TOC-L unit with solid sample module SSM-5000A was used for the analysis of total organic carbon of feed and char residue. The XRD pattern of prot lignin was recorded by Bruker D8 advance X-ray diffractometer at 0.01 step/ second scanning rate within 2-80° 2θ angle, and using Cu Kα as the source of X-ray. The FT-IR analysis of lignin and bio-oil samples were carried out by FT-IR Perkin Elmer-Spectrum II instrument for the detection of the functional group. 1H-NMR analysis of bio-oils was carried out in Bruker Avance 500 Plus instrument using DMSO-d 6 as a solvent. The GCMS analysis of all bio-oils was carried out in Agilent 7890 B gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) with HP-1 column (0.32 mm × 30 m × 0.17 μm) and 1.2 ml min−1 column flow rate of carrier (He) gas."
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure The depolymerization of lignin has been performed in an autoclave reactor having 50 ml Teflon vessel. At first, 1 g of lignin was loaded in the reactor with water (5 g), and ethanol (5 g) solvent mixture, and the appropriate amount of hydrogen peroxide (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 3.0 and 5.0 ml) was also added in the reaction mixture. The leak test of reactor was performed using nitrogen gas and while in case of reaction under a molecular oxygen atmosphere, the leak test was performed with molecular oxygen and then filled with 5 bar molecular oxygen. The reactor was heated to the desired temperature at 5 °C/min heating rate using thermocouple. After the reaction, the reactor was submerged into water to stop the reaction. After cooling the reactor, the solid residue was removed by filtration using ethanol in excess. Some amount of sodium sulfate anhydrous was added into the filtrate to remove any water. Upon the removal of the solvent by a rotatory evaporator, the obtained liquid product was termed as bio-oil, and the solid residue was named as char-residue. The reaction was performed three times, and the average yield was reported. The standard deviation in the product yields is within ±1%. The yields have been calculated by the following equations.

4,Results and discussion,
5,Feed characterization,"3.1 Feed characterization The ultimate and proximate analysis of lignin is given in Table 1 and it shows that the lignin is composed of 61.0 % carbon, 7.0 % hydrogen and 2.0 % sulphur. The volatile, fixed carbon, moisture and ash were observed as 77, 20, 4.0 and 3.0 % respectively. Feed characterization was performed using XRD, TG-DTG and FT-IR. The XRD and TG-DTG curves are given in supplementary information, and FT-IR spectrum of lignin is shown in Fig. 1 . XRD analysis of prot lignin did not show any sharp peak due to its amorphous nature. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) showed 71.5 % weight loss up to 900 °C. In the first stage from 25−120 °C, 2.1 % weight loss was observed due to removal of moisture. Major weight loss of lignin (48.1 % weight) loss was found within a wide temperature range (120−400 °C) due to decomposition of phenolic hydroxyl, carbonyl and benzyl hydroxyl groups present in complex structure of lignin (Domınguez et al., 2008). FT-IR analysis of lignin showed different functional groups corresponding to various vibrational bands. The band at 3420 cm−1 was indicative of the −OH functional group and two absorption bands at 2929 and 2848 cm−1 were observed due to asymmetric and symmetric –C–H stretching vibration. The absorption band at 1705 cm−1 was observed due to CO (ketonic) functional group of lignin. The vibrational band of 1607 and 1503 cm−1 were indicative of CC stretching of the aromatic ring. The detailed description of feed characterization is given in our previous publications (Singh et al., 2014; Biswas et al., 2016)."
6,Product yield,"3.2 Product yield 3.2.1 Effect of temperature Temperature is an important factor in liquefaction reaction. It was optimized by carrying out the reaction at different temperatures of 100, 120, 140, 160 and 180 °C for 1 h in the presence of 1 ml of 30 % H2O2 under an inert atmosphere. The product yields of the reaction was divided into bio-oil, char-residue and gas yield, which is given in Table 2 , and shown in Fig. 2 . It was observed that maximum bio-oil (79.5 wt.%) was obtained at 120 °C. The yield of bio-oil was 72.8, 79.0, 72.6 and 70.3 wt.% at 100, 140, 160 and 180 °C respectively. The results indicated that the bio-oil yield increased as the temperatures was raised from 100 to 120 °C, but on a further increase of temperature, it dropped down from 79.5–70.3 wt.%. The char residue was found to be 15.9 wt.% at 100 °C, and was 2.6 wt.% for 120 °C. Further increase in temperature lead to an increase in the char residue to 6.8 wt.% for 140 °C, 10.6 wt.% for 160 °C, and 28.3 wt.% for 180 °C. Moreover, the maximum gas yield (17.9 wt.%) was obtained at 120 °C. The gas yield was 11.3, 14.3 and 16.8 wt.% at 100, 140 and 160 °C respectively. Minimum gas yield (1.4 wt.%) was noticed at higher temperatures of 180 °C. This indicated that lower temperature was favourable for maximum liquefaction of prot lignin as higher temperature promoted high rate of repolymerization of active breaking intermediates of lignin (Ye et al., 2012; Singh et al., 2014). Hence, overall maximum conversion (97.4 wt.%) of prot lignin during the temperature variation was obtained at 120 °C, and minimum (71.7 wt.%) was observed at 180 °C. Conversion was 84.1, 93.3, 89.4 wt.% at 100, 140, 160 °C respectively. Based on maximum bio-oil yield, 120 °C was chosen as the optimum temperature to carry out the studies to identify the suitable residence time. 3.2.2 Effect of residence time The study to understand the effect of residence time on the depolymerization of prot lignin was carried out at 15, 30, 60, 120 min at 120 °C under an inert atmosphere, keeping the amount of oxidizing agent (1 ml H2O2) in the reaction mixture constant. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table 3 , maximum bio-oil yield (80.0 wt.%) was obtained at 30 min reaction residence time. It was 70.8, 79.5 and 75.6 wt.% at 15, 60 and 120 min reaction time respectively. In the case of char residue, maximum char residue yield (17.9 wt.%) was found at 15 min, which indicated the incomplete depolymerization of prot lignin. With an increase in the residence time, the char residue decreased to 6.6 wt.% for 30 min, and 2.6 wt.% for 60 min. But with further increase in the reaction residence time to 120 min, the char residue increased to 9.5 wt.%. Moreover, the production of gaseous yield with respect to different reaction residence time was observed as 11.3, 13.4, 17.9 and 14.9 wt.% for 15, 30, 60 and 120 min respectively. The results indicated that the long residence time promoted the decomposition of liquid product, leading to the conversion of it into char residue and gaseous product (Nizamuddin et al., 2019; Abnisa et al., 2011). The overall conversion of prot lignin was observed as 82.1, 93.4, 97.4 and 90.5 wt.% for 15, 30, 60 and 120 min reaction holding time respectively. Hence, 30 min was noted as favourable reaction time for maximum liquefaction of prot lignin at 120 °C in the presence of 1 ml H2O2 as an oxidizing agent. 3.2.3 Effect of different amount of H2O2 vs molecular oxygen The effect of various amounts 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 3.0 and 5.0 ml of H2O2 was investigated at optimum reaction conditions of 120 °C and 30 min residence time under an inert atmosphere. The product yields are given in Table 4 and shown in Fig. 4 . The observed results in the presence of hydrogen peroxide were compared with depolymerization of prot lignin using 1 bar N2 and 5 bar molecular oxygen. From Table 4, it can be seen that maximum bio-oil yield (80.0 wt.%) was obtained in the presence of 1.0 ml H2O2. It was 70.6 and 72.0 wt.%, while using 0.25 and 0.5 ml H2O2, respectively. With further increase in the amount of hydrogen peroxide in the reaction mixture, the bio-oil yield was observed as 78.6 wt.% for 1.5 ml, 73.5 wt.% for 3.0 ml, and 48.0 wt.% for 5.0 ml H2O2. But in the case of 1 bar N2 and 5 bar molecular oxygen, the bio-oil yield was obtained as 77.7 and 69.0 wt.% respectively. The observed continuous decrease in bio-oil yield with increasing amount of hydrogen peroxide indicated the more availability of active oxygen produced from the breaking of hydrogen peroxide, which initiated the repolymerization reaction. Char residue yield of 26.4 wt.% was observed in the presence of 5 bar molecular oxygen and it was 21.8 wt.% with 1 bar N2. In the case of H2O2, maximum char residue (25.2 wt.%) was found while using 0.25 ml H2O2 which indicated that lower amount is not sufficient for complete liquefaction of prot lignin. Moreover, with an increase in the amount of H2O2 in the reaction, char residue continuously decreased to 23.4 wt.% for 0.5 and 6.6 wt.% for 1.0 ml H2O2. The char residue production from the depolymerization of prot lignin using 1.5, 3.0 and 5.0 ml H2O2 was 7.7, 21.2 and 16.3 wt.% respectively. In addition, the gas yield was observed as 0.5 and 4.6 wt.% in the presence of 1 bar N2 and 5 bar O2 respectively. In the case of H2O2, the gaseous yield was found as 4.2, 4.6, 13.4, 13.8 and 5.3 wt.% with 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 3.0 ml H2O2 respectively. In the case of 5.0 ml H2O2, the gas yield was observed maximum at 35.7 wt.%. It was indicative that a certain amount of hydrogen peroxide was effectively cleaving the various bonds such as ether bonds and carbonyls in lignin. Further increase of hydrogen peroxide promoted the repolymerization and condensation of lignin intermediate monomer due to the presence of higher concentration of active oxygen atoms, which might be the reason of high char residue and gaseous product formation. It was also noted that while using a high amount of hydrogen peroxide (5.0 ml), most part of bio-oil was converted into tar due to high content of oxygen radicals in the bio-oil. The overall conversion of prot lignin was found as 78.2 and 73.6 wt.% in the presence of 1 bar N2 and 5 bar molecular oxygen respectively. Although with H2O2, the conversion of lignin was observed as 74.8, 76.6, 93.4, 92.4, 78.8 and 83.7 wt.% with 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 3.0 and 5.0 ml H2O2 respectively. Gu and his co-workers reported the total product conversion of 32 % from the oxidative depolymerization of organosolv beech lignin in the presence of La/SBA-15 catalysts with H2O2 as an oxidizing agent (Gu et al., 2012). Ouyang et al., also reported 90.2 % degree of depolymerization in the presence of CuO/Fe2(SO4)/NaOH catalyst using 16 ml methanol and 4 ml water as solvent and H2O2 as an oxidizing agent (Ouyang et al., 2016). Moreover, we have compared the yield and product profile obtained in this work with previous published work as shown in Table 5 . Comparable yields of bio-oil and conversion of prot lignin have been observed. Lignin and char residue obtained from the depolymerization reaction was analysed using TOC (total organic carbon), and the results are given in Table 6 . TOC results showed the maximum conversion of prot lignin using 1 ml hydrogen peroxide as compared to 5 bar molecular oxygen and 1 bar nitrogen, which is in good agreement with the above study."
7,Bio-oil characterization,"3.3 Bio-oil characterization 3.3.1 GC–MS analysis of bio-oil GC–MS analysis has been carried out for bio-oil formed due to depolymerization of prot lignin using different amount of hydrogen peroxide, and in the presence of 1 bar N2 and 5 bar molecular oxygen. The compounds were divided into four categories as Guaiacol (G), Syringyl (S) and Hydroxyphenyl (H) type phenolics, and other type compounds as given in Tables 7 and 8 , and also shown in Fig. 5 . The compounds which have one methoxy along with hydroxyl group such as 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol, vanillin, apocynin, etc., were grouped as G-type phenolics. S-type phenolics have two methoxy along with hydroxyl group (Benzaldehyde, 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxy, (acetosyringone) Ethanone, 1-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl) etc.). H-type phenolics were composed of only hydroxyl group-containing GCMS compound. Remaining all GCMS compounds other than G, S and H-type were grouped as other type. It was observed that 30.8 % of G-type phenolics were formed in the presence of 1 bar N2, while 29.4 % was found using 5 bar molecular oxygen. In the case of hydrogen peroxide, 27.6 % of G-type phenolics were observed with 0.25 ml hydrogen peroxide, and it was 17.7, 13.8 and 24.9 % with 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 ml H2O2 respectively. It was observed that 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol was formed as major G-type compound from the depolymerization of prot lignin. It was found in the maximum amount of 15.4 % when the reaction was carried out in the presence of 5 bar O2, and it was 14.2 % with 0.25 ml H2O2. The amount of S-type phenolics was noticed as 41.5 and 56.7 % in the presence of 1 bar N2 and 5 bar O2 respectively. Maximum area % of S-type phenolics (66.7) was observed with 0.5 ml H2O2. However, 57.7, 32.4 and 31.9 % of S-type phenolics was found while using 0.25, 1.0 and 1.5 ml H2O2 respectively. Among all S-type phenolics, maximum area percentage (59.3) of acetosyringone was observed with 0.5 ml hydrogen peroxide. It was observed that the degree of demethoxylation was enhanced with increase in the amount of hydrogen peroxide. It might be due to the presence of higher oxygen content, which promoted the side chain breaking, and the ring-opening of aromatic compounds (Ma et al., 2018). A very less amount of H-type phenolics were found at 1.6 % for 1 bar N2, 2.3 % for 5 bar O2 and 2.2 % for 0.25 ml H2O2 during the depolymerization of prot lignin. In the case of other type compounds, 1 bar N2 and 5 bar O2 showed 24.2 and 9.7 % GC–MS area respectively, while 12.7% of other type compounds were observed with 0.25 ml of hydrogen peroxide. It was continuously increasing (maximum 51.6 % for 1.0 ml H2O2) with increase in the amount of hydrogen peroxide, which proved that there was high rate of lignin breaking due to the presence of active oxygen atom, leading to formation of various acidic and ester compounds such as Benzoic acid, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-, ethyl ester, Propanoic acid, 3-ethoxy-, ethyl ester 3-Penten-2-one, 4-methyl etc. The variation in G, H, S and other type compounds with N2, O2, and with the different amount of hydrogen peroxide shows the difference in breaking of various types of linkages (β-O-4, α-β, β-β etc.) of lignin. It also indicates that depolymerized lignin intermediate radical monomers underwent various types of reactions such as alkylation, esterification, demethoxylation, condensation, side-chain breaking, ring-opening and keto-enol isomerization during the lignin depolymerization (Ma et al., 2018; Zakzeski et al., 2011; Hanson et al., 2012; Kang et al., 2013; Singh et al., 2014). 3.3.2 FT-IR and 1H-NMR analysis of bio-oil FT-IR analysis of bio-oils showed the presence of various functional groups (methylene, methoxy, carbonyl, etc.) corresponding to different vibrational frequency as shown in Fig. 6 . All the bio-oils showed OH vibrational band at 3449 cm−1. Two vibration bands were found at 2922 and 2846 cm−1 due to asymmetric and symmetric vibration of –CH, and the vibration band observed at 1710 cm−1 showed the presence of CO in all bio-oil samples. The vibration bands at 1617 and 1514 cm−1 were indicative of the CC stretching of syringyl and guaiacyl aromatic ring. The absorption band observed at 1464 cm−1 showed the CH bending of the methoxy group (Popescu et al., 2006). The higher intensity of 1514 cm−1 vibration was noted in the case of 1.5 ml H2O2 bio-oil. The vibration band of 1210 cm−1 appeared due to CO stretching of syringyl unit, and 1117 cm−1 was found for the aromatic CH deformation of syringyl unit (Biswas et al., 2016; Popescu et al., 2006). The vibration bands in raw lignin FT-IR spectrum at 1330, 2354 and 2333 cm−1 were absent in FT-IR spectra of bio-oil. This confirmed the breaking of lignin into a different functional group-containing compounds. 1H-NMR analysis of bio-oils provided the information of types of protons of the different functional group. The integrated peak area of protons present in the bio-oil sample, which was obtained from the depolymerization of prot lignin using the different reaction condition, have been divided into various classes, as given in supplementary information. The region of spectrum from 0.5 to 3.0 ppm indicate aliphatic protons, the region between 0.5–1.5 are composed of aliphatic proton that are away from any CC, CO and sp2 hybridized carbon atom (Singh et al., 2014). A maximum percentage of this kind of protons (11.6 %) was obtained in the bio-oil obtained from the prot lignin depolymerization in the presence of 1.5 ml H2O2. These proton percentages were 10.7 and 5.7 in bio-oils from 1 bar N2 and 5 bar O2 experiments. The 1H-NMR region from 1.5 to 3.0 ppm showed the aliphatic proton that are attached to sp2 hybridized carbon (alkene or carbonyl). In this region, maximum proton percentage (7.3) was found using 0.25 ml of H2O2. While in the case of 1 bar N2 and 5 bar O2, this type proton percentage was observed as 6.0 and 5.6 % respectively. The next proton region from 3.0–6.0 ppm was composed of the proton of methoxy, methylene and also of the aromatic ether (Kosa et al., 2011). All bio-oil samples showed higher proton percentage in this region. The bio-oil obtained from the prot lignin depolymerization in the presence of 1 bar N2 and 5 bar O2 showed 63.4 and 77.7 % of this type of protons respectively. Maximum proton percentage (84.9) was observed while using 1.0 ml of H2O2. Bio-oil obtained using 0.25, 0.5, 1.5 ml of H2O2 showed 73.4, 82.2 and 74.6 % of this type of proton respectively. The downfield shielded region of spectrum 6.0–8.0 and 8.0–10.0 ppm showed proton percentage of aromatic, acidic and aldehyde proton (Singh et al., 2014). In the aromatic region of spectrum (6.0–8.0 ppm), the maximum proton percentage (17.7) was found in bio-oil of 1 bar N2, and 9.8 % was observed for 5 bar O2. In the case of hydrogen peroxide, maximum 10.6 % of the aromatic proton was obtained in the bio-oil of 0.25 ml of H2O2. The proton percentage of the aromatic proton decreased to 8.7 % with 0.5 ml and to 5.8 % with 1.0 ml H2O2. When using 1.5 ml, it increased to 10.0 %. The proton percentage of acidic and aldehyde type was found to be very small in all bio-oils. FT-IR and 1H-NMR analysis of bio-oils was in good agreement with the GC–MS analysis of bio-oils and confirmed the presence of substituted phenolics (2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol, acetosyringone, vanillin, Benzaldehyde, 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxy etc.), acidic, ester (Benzoic acid, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-, ethyl ester etc.) formed due to breaking of various types of linkages C-C, C-O-C (β-O-4, α-O-4) of lignin macromolecule."
8,Possible mechanistic breaking of lignin into valuable monomers,"3.4 Possible mechanistic breaking of lignin into valuable monomers The bio-oil characterization using various techniques suggests a possible mechanism to understand the breaking of lignin under the studied reaction conditions. The change in relative intensity of compounds with reaction condition is shown in Fig. 7 . The formation of different type of products during the breaking of lignin with variation in amount of hydrogen peroxide is given in supplementary information. In the presence of 1 bar N2, water-ethanol solvent produced the ethoxide radical due to the thermal breaking of C2H5OH (Voitl and Von Rohr, 2008; Ye et al., 2012). The produced ethoxide radical abstracted the proton from the α-hydroxyl group of lignin and converted it into oxide radical anion, which underwent the rearrangement, and α-β and β-O-4 bonds breaking, leading to the formation of acetosyringone (34.4 %), 2-methoxy-4-vinyl phenol (12.1 %) and vanillin (4.7 %). But with 5 bar molecular oxygen, the breaking of α-β bond enhanced, which increased the formation of acetosyringone (49.0 %), 2-methoxy-4-vinyl phenol (15.4 %) and vanillin (10.3 %) type product. In the case of hydrogen peroxide, ethoxide radical abstracted the proton from hydrogen peroxide due to its high acidity and converted the hydrogen peroxide into hydroperoxy radical (Shilpy et al., 2015). These hydroperoxy radicals are highly reactive and more stable as compared to superoxide due to which lignin underwent high rate of α-β and β-O-4 bond breaking, and produced more acetosyringone in the presence of 0.25 ml (50.5 %) and 0.5 ml (59.3 %) hydrogen peroxide. However, with further increase in the amount of hydrogen peroxide in the reaction from 0.5 to 1.0 and 1.5 ml, the side chain breaking reaction (β-O-4 bond breaking) became lesser and showed a decrease in (23.3 % for 1.0 and 28.0 % for 1.5 ml) formation of acetosyringone. It can be assumed that the higher amount of hydrogen peroxide promoted the ring-opening reaction because of presence of high concentration of active hydroperoxy radicals in the reaction, (Kurek et al., 1996; Fabbri et al., 2008; Ma et al., 2018) leading to the formation of acidic compounds such as Benzoic acid, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-, ethyl ester, 3-Penten-2-one, 4-methyl etc."
9,Conclusions,"Maximum liquefaction of prot lignin (80.0 wt.%) was observed in the presence 1 ml of hydrogen peroxide at 120 °C/30 min reaction condition. With an increase in the amount of hydrogen peroxide in the reaction mixture, the bio-oil yield decreased. While using 1 bar nitrogen and 5 bar molecular oxygen, the bio-oil yield was found to be 77.7 wt.% and 69.0 wt.% respectively. The GCMS analysis of bio-oil showed maximum area percentage of acetosyringone (59.3 %) with 0.5 ml hydrogen peroxide. FT-IR and 1H-NMR analysis of bio-oils confirmed the presence of various functional groups of substituted phenolics, aromatic ester and aliphatic compounds formed due to breaking of various linkages such as β-O-4, α-O-4 and α-β etc."
