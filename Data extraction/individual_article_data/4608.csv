0,Introduction,"The world is turning to a search for clean energy sources to mitigate coming climate change and the impending shortage of readily available fuel to provide the energy necessary for present and future human activities (Hallenbeck et al., 2012). Among the possible fuel sources, hydrogen offers tremendous potential as a clean, renewable energy currency, which is compatible with electrochemical and combustion processes for energy conversion without emission of carbon-based greenhouse gases (Das and Verziroglu, 2001; Levin et al., 2004). However, a sustainable, renewable supply of hydrogen to meet present energy requirements is not available. Among the approaches of hydrogen production, dark fermentative biohydrogen production seems to be more realizable in the short run, which can use a wide variety of potential wastewater, solid waste and biomass. These substrates are present in sufficient quantities to make a significant contribution to meeting energy needs if they are efficiently converted to hydrogen by fermentation. This approach of fermentative hydrogen production, although attractive, suffers from many challenges to the practical implementation (Hallenbeck, 2011). The major barrier is the limitations of the natural metabolic process available in the fermentative hydrogen production processes. Only one-third of the substrate can be used for hydrogen production, with the remaining two-thirds forming another fermentation product acetate, butyrate, butanol, acetone, etc. (Hallenbeck, 2009). Relatively low energy conversion efficiency of the substrates and unsatisfactory stability limit the practical applicability of the process. Thus, much work should be done on how to improve the conversion efficiency of substrate to hydrogen, to enhance the bioactivity of hydrogen-producing microorganisms, and to make hydrogen production stable over a long time period. To date, study of nanoparticle functions is gaining momentum because of their great potential in application to many science fields such as medicine, optics, magnetics, mechanics, catalysis, electronics, etc. Moreover, there are enormous interests in using nanoparticles for biological application, including enzyme encapsulation (Johnson et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2008), DNA transfection (Mao et al., 2001; Sandhu et al., 2002) and biosensors (Riboh et al., 2003; Haun et al., 2010). Some microorganisms may take advantages of nanoparticles especially in anaerobic environment, by transferring more efficiently electrons to acceptors (Beckers et al., 2013). Some nanoparticles have shown that they can improve the kinetics of bioprocess through the capacity to react rapidly with electron donors, and enhance the activity of microorganisms as biocatalysts (Xu et al., 2012). Zhang and Shen (2007) have reported that the addition of 5-nm-gold nanoparticle improved the efficiency of biohydrogen fermentation considerably, and the maximum increase of hydrogen yield reached 36.3% compared with the blank test. In this contribution, other precious metal nanoparticles may also have the potential to improve the conversion efficiency of substrate to biohydrogen in the process of fermentation. Silver nanoparticle has several characteristics that make it widely used in electronics, bio-sensing, clothing, food industry, paints, sunscreens, cosmetics and medical devices (Ahamed et al., 2010). Furthermore, silver nanoparticle is excellent biocompatible surface for the immobilization of enzymes (Sadjadi et al., 2009). Nevertheless, it also exhibits antimicrobial activity by close contact with the microorganisms leading to membrane disruption (Neal, 2008). Therefore, the contradictory results make it rather attractive to investigate the effect of silver nanoparticles on the dark fermentative conversion of organic substrates to biohydrogen. In the present work, the effect and biocompatibility of silver nanoparticles on hydrogen-producing bacteria were investigated in three systems (System A: activated culture added with different concentration of silver nanoparticles; System B: alkaline pretreated culture with different concentration of inorganic ammonium; System C: alkaline pretreated culture with different concentration of inorganic ammonium as well as silver nanoparticles). The activated culture used in this study was mixed anaerobic hydrogen-producing bacteria, which can convert glucose, sucrose, starch, etc. to hydrogen with high efficiency. While the alkaline pretreated culture used in this study was pretreated for 24h by high strength of alkaline solution, and it had ceased to produce biogas."
1,Methods,
2,Seed microorganisms,"2.1 Seed microorganisms The activated anaerobic cultures with ability to produce hydrogen were enriched from the aeration basin of local municipal wastewater treatment plant. After an anaerobic enrichment in the basal medium (pH 4.5) consisting of 1.0% glucose, 2.0% peptone, 0.05% MgSO4·7H2O, 0.2% K2HPO4 and 0.05% yeast extract, hydrogen-producing bacteria were selected based on the existence of hydrogen in the evolved gas (Zhang and Shen, 2007). The organisms used in this study, which were responsible for hydrogen production, were dominated by Clostridium butyricum. These hydrogen-producing bacteria were seeded into a 1L completed stirred reactor (CSTR), grown on a sucrose mineral salts medium at 35°C and a 24h hydraulic retention time (HRT), and stirred by gas circulation. One liter of the medium contained sucrose, 12,500mg; NH4HCO3, 3770mg; K2HPO4, 125mg; NaHCO3, 2000mg; CuSO4·5H2O, 5mg; MgCl2·6H2O, 100mg; MnSO4·4H2O, 15mg; FeSO4·7H2O, 25mg; CoCl2·6H2O, 0.125mg."
3,Reagents,"2.2 Reagents Silver nitrate (AgNO3, Guaranteed Reagent) and sodium citrate (Na3C6H5O7·2H2O, Analytical Reagent) were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co. China. Glucose, NaHCO3, NH4Cl, K2HPO4·3H2O, CuSO4·5H2O, MgCl2·6H2O, MnSO4·4H2O, FeSO4·7H2O, and CoCl2·6H2O were analytical pure and purchased from Beijing Yili Fine Chemical Co., Ltd. China. Doubly distilled, deionized water was used for preparation of all aqueous solutions. Unless noted otherwise, reagents and solvents were used as purchased."
4,Preparation of silver nanoparticles,"2.3 Preparation of silver nanoparticles Preparation procedures of silver nanoparticles are as follows (Zheng et al., 2008). A stock solution of silver nanoparticles (2.0×10−4 gmL−1) was prepared by dissolving 0.0158g of AgNO3 in 40mL of doubly distilled water. When 2mL sodium citrate (1%) was added slowly to AgNO3 solution by heating at 86°C with stirring for 30min, the solution color changed gradually from colorless to olivine. Then the mixed liquor was diluted to 50mL. The above solutions were stored at 0–4°C."
5,Experimental procedures,"2.4 Experimental procedures Batch experiments were conducted in 120-mL vials with a working volume of 80mL. System A: the mixed liquor was added with 20mL inoculum (activated hydrogen-producing culture), 40mL nutrient solution and 20mL silver nanoparticle sol (final concentrations ranging from 0 to 200nmolL−1). System B: the mixed liquor was added with 20mL inoculum (pretreated culture), 40mL nutrient solution and 20mL NH4Cl solution (final concentrations ranging from 0 to 4.4gNL−1). System C: the mixed liquor was the same as System B, besides the addition of 20nmolL−1 silver nanoparticle sol. That is, the blank test for System A was prepared without the addition of silver nanoparticles. The blank test for System B was prepared without the addition of both silver nanoparticles and nitrogen source, while that of System C was prepared without nitrogen source only. The above-mentioned nutrition solution was prepared by adding glucose, 25,000mg; NaHCO3, 4000mg; K2HPO4·3H2O, 250mg; CuSO4·5H2O, 10mg; MgCl2·6H2O, 200mg; MnSO4·4H2O, 30mg; FeSO4·7H2O, 50mg; CoCl2·6H2O, 0.25mg into 1L of water. The initial anaerobic condition in the reactor was established by nitrogen gas sparging for 5min. The initial pH of the medium was between 8.0 and 9.4 without control throughout the whole experiment and operation temperature of the reactor was controlled at 35°C. The bottles were placed in a reciprocal shaker (Reciprocation: 5cm×120strokespermin). The biogas production was measured by a plunger displacement method using appropriately sized glass syringes, arranging from 10 to 100mL."
6,Chemical analysis,"2.5 Chemical analysis The microstructure of silver nanoparticles was determined with a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Hitachi H-800 microscope, Japan) and a UV–vis Spectrometer (Lambda 35, PerkinElmer, USA). The proportion of hydrogen was determined with a gas chromatograph (GC9790, Zhejiang Fuli, China) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A 2-m stainless iron column packed with GDX-102 (60/80mesh). The operating temperatures of the injection port, the oven, and the detector were set at 80, 50 and 100°C, respectively. Nitrogen gas was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 30mLmin−1. Detection of liquid metabolites was also analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC9790, Zhejiang Fuli, China) using a flame ionization detector (FID). A 2-m glass column packed with Unisole F-200 (30/60mesh). The temperatures of the injection port, the oven, and the detector were 200, 150, and 220°C, respectively. The carrier gas was also nitrogen at a flow rate of 30mLmin−1.The final concentrations of glucose after the fermentation were determined by the phenol–sulfuric acid method using glucose as a standard (Dubios et al., 1956). The concentrations of volatile suspended solids (VSS) were determined according to the procedures described in the standard methods (APHA, 1995). The pH was measured using a pH meter (PHS-3B Shanghai, China). All gas production data reported were standardized to standard temperature (0°C) and pressure (760mmHg)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,TEM and UV–vis measurements,"3.1 TEM and UV–vis measurements The TEM micrograph of silver nanoparticles showed that the average diameters were approximately 15nm and the standard deviation was 2nm. According to the literature, the spectral response of silver nanoparticles can be as a function of diameter. The maximum absorption is moving to longer wavelengths as the diameter of silver nanoparticles increases. Bijanzadeh et al. (2012) have measured the absorption peak of silver nanoparticles in deionized water, and the absorption peak of nanoparticles from 1 to 17nm varies between 395 and 425nm. The silver nanoparticles prepared in this study exhibit an intense absorption band and have an absorption peak at 405nm."
9,General fermentation data,"3.2 General fermentation data For the three systems, individual batch experiments were observed until the evolution of hydrogen from each bottle stopped. Data shown were average results of independent experiments that were triplicate. The glucose degradation efficiency was estimated by dividing the amount of glucose consumed by the amount of initial glucose. Glucose was utilized completely (98.5±1%, data not shown) for all the tests in this work. Product analysis showed that the anaerobic fermentation produced a biogas only containing hydrogen and carbon dioxide, without detectable methane and hydrogen sulfide, suggesting that no methanogens or sulfate-reducing bacteria were active in the cultures used in this study."
10,Effect of silver nanoparticles on fermentative biohydrogen production of System A (activated inoculum),"3.3 Effect of silver nanoparticles on fermentative biohydrogen production of System A (activated inoculum) 3.3.1 Cumulative hydrogen production Fig. 1 illustrates the effect of different concentration of silver nanoparticles on hydrogen production of System A. There was a high rate of hydrogen production for 12h without obvious lag phase. The data clearly showed that the addition of silver nanoparticles increased the production yield of hydrogen, especially when the concentration of silver nanoparticles was ranging from 20 to 200nmolL−1. The maximum yield of hydrogen production reached 308mL with the addition of 20nmolL−1 silver nanoparticles. The results suggested that the addition of silver nanoparticles could effectively improve the bioactivity of the hydrogen-producing bacteria. That is, silver nanoparticles could not only improve the kinetics of biohydrogen production, but increase the total volumetric production from glucose. 3.3.2 Glucose conversion efficiency into hydrogen and biomass The data in Table 1 show that the activated hydrogen-producing bacteria made a quick response to the addition of nanoparticles. The yield and percentage of hydrogen increased sharply compared with the blank test. The maximum yield (2.48mol/molglucose) and percent (61.45%) of hydrogen were obtained at the silver nanoparticles of 20nmolL−1. When the concentration of silver nanoparticles continued to increase higher than 20nmolL−1, the yield and percent of hydrogen kept constantly. The biomass growth in batch tests was measured after the whole fermentation period, which increased obviously with the addition of silver nanoparticles. From the distribution of the dry biomass weight, we could conclude that the quantities of the bacteria almost followed the same trend with the hydrogen production yield. The results indicated that the enhancement of hydrogen production strongly depended on the concentration of silver nanoparticles, and 20nmolL−1 was the optimal condition to catalyze the biohydrogen fermentation. Depending upon the hydrogenase used, NADH-dependent, Fd-dependent with ferredoxin reduced via NADH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, or the bifurcating NADH-Fd dependent hydrogenase, 2–4mol of hydrogen per mole of glucose can be obtained (Hallenbeck et al., 2012). Hydrogen conversion efficiencies for carbohydrates were usually calculated based on the assumption of a maximum of 4mol of hydrogen per mole of glucose or a maximum of 8mol of hydrogen per mole of sucrose, assuming a maximum stoichiometric conversion of the substrate to hydrogen and acetate. In this work, the conversion efficiency for the blank test in System A was 37%, which was much lower than the value obtained in those tests with silver nanoparticles. The maximum conversion efficiency of glucose to hydrogen was 62% with 20nmolL−1 silver nanoparticles. 3.3.3 Liquid metabolites distribution Aside from hydrogen and carbon dioxide, the major metabolites produced by the anaerobic culture were alcohols and volatile fatty acids (VFAs). Table 2 lists the variation of individual VFAs and alcohols. For most tests the soluble metabolites principally consisted of ethanol (EtOH), acetic acid (HAc), and butyric acid (HBu), while relatively smaller amounts of propionic acid (HPr), and valeric acid (HVa) were also detected. As shown in Table 2, with the increase of silver nanoparticles concentration the acid-forming pathway gradually dominated the metabolic flow. It should be noted that the yield of HAc and HBu increased obviously with the addition of silver nanoparticles, and contrarily the yield of EtOH decreased sharply compared with the blank. Productions of HBu and HAc were in accord with the trend of hydrogen production, indicating that acidogenic bacteria that produced HBu and HAc contributed to the majority of hydrogen production. The results indicated that the addition of silver nanoparticles caused the activated culture to produce more acids together with hydrogen. Although H2 production was accompanied by acid formation, the pH value was always within a range of 6–7, due to the buffering capacity of the medium. According to the literature, high H2 yields are associated with a mixture of acetate and butyrate as fermentation products, and low H2 yields are associated with propionate and reduced end-products (alcohols, lactic acid) (Zhang et al., 2005). As shown in Table 2, the tests with the addition of silver nanoparticles had less EtOH, HPr and HVa than the blank test, that is, the addition of silver nanoparticles, effectively direct metabolism away from alcohols or reduced acids and towards volatile fatty acid production."
11,Effect of silver nanoparticles on fermentative biohydrogen production of Systems B and C (pretreated inoculum),"3.4 Effect of silver nanoparticles on fermentative biohydrogen production of Systems B and C (pretreated inoculum) Hydrogen gas does not ordinarily accumulate to high concentration in anaerobic reactors with mixed cultures due primarily to the consumption of hydrogen by methanogens. Earlier research suggests that if the final step or methanogenesis were blocked by inhibiting methanogens, only acidogens would be left to produce more hydrogen gas, carbon dioxide, and volatile acids (Wang et al., 2003). To avoid losses of hydrogen to methane, a pretreated process was used here to exclude nonspore forming bacteria originally present in the culture. For Systems B and C, the mixed culture was pretreated with high strength of alkaline solution for 24h (Na2CO3 solution, pH 11.6). Such pretreated cultures had ceased evolution of biogas and the hydrogen-producing bacteria had been inhibited to produce hydrogen. The recovery of biohydrogen fermentation was accomplished through the supplement of abundant nitrogen source. The fermentation media were supplemented with NH4Cl ranging from 1.125 to 4.125gL−1, which implies the concentration of inorganic nitrogen ranging from 0.3 to 1.1gNL−1. The foregoing tests in System A had proved that the addition of 20nmolL−1 silver nanoparticles had remarkable effects on the improvement of the bioactivity of activated hydrogen-producing bacteria. Therefore, in the following study for the pretreated systems, the concentration of silver nanoparticles added to the reactors (System C) was 20nmolL−1. 3.4.1 Cumulative hydrogen production As shown in Fig. 2 , for the both blank tests in Systems B and C, the evolution of biogas was not detected throughout the whole experimental period, indicating that the bioactivity of anaerobic bacteria after alkaline-pretreatment could not be recovered without the supplement of nitrogen source. Fig. 2 (System B) illustrates the effects of different concentration of inorganic nitrogen source on cumulative hydrogen production. After the initial lag phase, hydrogen production of all the tests sharply increased, which indicated that the quick recovery of the hydrogen-producing bacteria consuming glucose to produce biogas. The supplement of nitrogen remarkably increased the biohydrogen fermentation for all the tests compared to the blank and the maximum yield of hydrogen (190.7mL) was obtained at the nitrogen concentration of 0.7gNL−1. However, when the nitrogen concentration was increased to 1.1gNL−1, the hydrogen yield decreased to 112.9mL. The above results indicated that the bioactivity of hydrogen-producing bacteria can be recovered and promoted by the supplement of nitrogen, but excess nitrogen is harmful to the hydrogen-producing activity of the fermentative bacteria in this work. For System C (the tests with silver nanoparticles), the maximum yield of hydrogen (216.0mL) was also obtained at the nitrogen concentration of 0.7gNL−1, and the hydrogen yields of System C were obviously higher than those of System B. 3.4.2 Lag phase and total hydrogen yield The occurrence of the lag phase, a phase without any biogas production, was observed in all the tests of pretreated culture. By contrast, significant difference was observed for the lag phase that varies between 72 and 108h for all the tests. As shown in Fig. 3 , for the test of 0.3gNL−1 (System B), the hydrogen fermentation started at 108h since the fermentation began, and the total hydrogen yield was ca. 188.1mL. The lag phase dropped subsequently with the increase of supplemental nitrogen concentration. The shortest lag phase of 84h was obtained at 0.9 and 1.1gNL−1 (System B). It is worth noting that the addition of silver nanoparticles could further reduce the lag phase of hydrogen fermentation. All the tests in System C had shorter lag phases compared to the corresponding test in System B. The shortest lag phase of 72h was obtained at 0.7gNL−1. That is, besides the increase of hydrogen yields, the addition of silver nanoparticles has another significant effect on the activation of hydrogen-producing bacteria. As can be seen from Fig. 3, the total hydrogen yield decreased sharply when the culture had excess of nitrogen (>0.7gNL−1) for the tests in System B, which kept consistently and had no obvious drop under the same circumstance for the tests in System C. Even if the nitrogen concentration was increased higher than 0.7gNL−1, the total yields of hydrogen in System C remained high corresponding to the tests without silver nanoparticles. The above results indicated that the addition of silver nanoparticles can not only efficiently improve the hydrogen-producing activity of the bacteria, but enhance the endurance of the bacteria to excess nitrogen. 3.4.3 Glucose conversion efficiency into hydrogen and biomass As shown in Table 3 , the most obvious difference between Systems B and C was that the addition of 20nmolL−1 silver nanoparticles increased the biomass yields. The conversion efficiencies for the pretreated systems were in the range of 23–41%, which is much lower than the values of those tests in System A with activated hydrogen-producing bacteria. Goud and Mohan (2012) reported that the acidic and alkaline shock pretreatment could enrich the acidogenic biohydrgen producing mixed culture and enhance hydrogen production efficiency of mixed anaerobic consortia. However, the tests in this work showed different results that the alkaline shock could not enhance the hydrogen production efficiency of mixed culture immediately. The validity check of such pretreatment methods should be investigated in further research for long term operation. The experiments were performed in triplicate and reproduced two times to verify the reliability of the catalytic activity of silver nanoparticles. The reproducible results were obtained that the enhancement bioactivity of the hydrogen-producing microbe depended on the concentration of nanoparticles. Remarkably, the maximum hydrogen yield (2.48mol/molglucose) from glucose fermentation in this work was obtained at the silver concentration of 20nmolL−1. The maximum substrate conversion efficiency in this study is 62%, which is lower than the value (67%) observed in the thermophilic fermentative hydrogen production from glucose by anaerobic mixed cultures (Kim and Kim, 2012), but is higher than most of many recent studies as shown in Table 4 ."
12,Conclusion,"In this work, a hydrogen production system catalyzed by silver nanoparticles was developed. Silver nanoparticles could significantly improve the efficiency of hydrogen production and recover the bioactivity of the mixed culture, which will be of remarkably potential in the wastewater treatment application. A better understanding of the catalytic mechanism of silver nanoparticles does obviously require more experimental and theoretical work, such as genetic engineering, spectroscopic studies, and high-resolution crystallographic studies of the anaerobically purified enzymes frozen in various states. Some work in these directions is already in progress and will be communicated in due course."
