0,Introduction,"The unavoidable formation of nitrogen oxides (NO x ) during the combustion of fuels with air represents a significant harm to the environment. NO x emissions – comprising the species of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) – contribute to ozone depletion, cause the production of photochemical smog, and are dangerous to human health [1,2]. One third of the total energy consumption in Europe is required to provide domestic hot water and heating. With a share of roughly 80 %, natural gas represents the main energy source [3]. Consequently, household gas burners significantly contribute to global NO x emissions and legal regulations like the European norm DIN EN 15502 were established, which stipulate NO x emission limits for new gas-fired boilers [4,5]. Several studies analyzed the combustion characteristics and emission formation in condensing gas boiler systems from a global perspective [6–8]. Hinrichs et al. [9] provided detailed information on local CO and NO x formation in the heating unit of a condensing gas boiler. Experimental measurements of radial temperature, CO, and NO profiles revealed significant inhomogeneities in the combustion chamber depending on the considered axial height. This complicated the comparison with resolved simulations of a representative burner hole. However, well validated temperature and NO x species profiles are a prerequisite to analyze the contribution of the various NO formation pathways in more detail. In order to increase the reliability of the simulation and identify suitable measures to reduce NO x emissions from condensing gas boilers, further analyzes on NO x formation in laminar premixed flames were performed in the present study on a simplified perforated-plate burner. The burner setup was derived from the cylindrical multi-hole burner considered in Ref. [9], but set up in a way to provide well-defined boundary conditions for the simulation. Many studies have already dealt with NO formation in premixed flames on perforated-plate burners. Konnov et al. [10–13] and Coppens et al. [14,15] studied NO formation in adiabatic flames for various fuels numerically and experimentally applying the the heat flux method proposed by de Goey et al. [16]. Glarborg et al. [2] pointed out in their recent review article that even though NO formation was subject of extensive research over the last decades, the governing chemical processes are still not fully understood. Consequently, many studies developed or improved detailed reaction mechanisms for NO formation in recent decades [2,10–15,17–28]. In a step towards evaluating existing NO mechanisms, Kovacs et al. [29] collected a huge amount of data including various experimental setups and operating conditions from more than 30 publications and compared 17 existing NO mechanisms with experimental data. They found that the mechanism from Glarborg et al. [2] showed the overall best agreement for this large data set. However, Kovacs et al. [29] only focused on N/H/O elementary reactions and neglected hydrocarbon fuels like methane, ethane, or propane, which are major components in natural gas commonly used in condensing gas boilers. Therefore, the question remains if the mechanism from Glarborg et al. [2] is also able to capture NO x formation in condensing gas boilers using common natural gas components. The NO x prediction capabilities of the NO sub-mechanism from Glarborg et al. [2] were compared to different well-known NO reaction mechanisms under condensing gas boiler conditions and validated with experimental measurements in this study. The emerging role of advanced fuels from renewable resources, such as hydrogen, and local fluctuations in the gas quality enforce a high fuel-flexibility of novel condensing gas boilers, while ensuring safe and stable burner operation and simultaneously meeting emission regulations. The European norm DIN EN 437 [30] defines several test gas compositions, for which emission norms need to be fulfilled. Therefore, pure methane, methane/hydrogen, and methane/propane flames were studied and their impact on the NO x formation was investigated. The effect of substituting methane by hydrogen or propane on NO x formation has already been studied in literature [14,20,31–34]. Boyd Fackler et al. [34] experimentally studied NO formation in a jet-stirred reactor at atmospheric conditions and found a modest increase in NO with increasing C/H ratio, while hydrogen led to a lower NO level. Williams et al. [33] analyzed CH and NO concentrations in premixed pure methane and propane flames under low-pressure conditions. They found higher NO concentrations in propane flames under lean conditions than for pure methane, even though the CH concentration in propane flames was lower and the prompt pathway was by far the most important pathway. They concluded that other intermediate carbon species significantly contribute to the NO formation, which were not considered by the used NO reaction mechanisms. Pillier et al. [20] also investigated laminar premixed flames of methane and methane/propane numerically and experimentally under low-pressure conditions. They concluded that NO remains unchanged when methane is partially substituted by ethane or propane ( < 10 %) for a given equivalence ratio. Bohon et al. [35,36] investigated various alkanes and renewable alcohols in Bunsen-type flames and in a McKenna burner. They found slightly increased NO x emissions for lean propane-air- compared to methane-air-mixtures for both burner configurations [36]. It is challenging to transfer the findings of different fuel types and burner configurations on NO x formation from literature to the applied case of condensing gas boilers. The usage of different fuels affects the adiabatic flame temperature and radical concentrations, which are important influencing variables for NO x formation. In addition, the laminar burning velocity varies for different fuels leading to different stand-off distances and flame heat losses to the burner. This impacts the post-flame temperature and may dominate the other influencing factors. Therefore, the complex interaction of the different fuel types on NO x formation were investigated using a generic perforated-plate burner in the present study."
1,Experimental methods,
2,Burner setup,"2.1 Burner setup The investigated perforated-plate burner was derived from the cylindrical multi-hole burner contained in the condensing gas boiler device studied previously [9]. The surface of the perforated-plate burner was scaled down by a factor of 7.84 compared to the multi-hole burner. The mass flows were decreased by the same factor to obtain identical outflow velocities and an equal load per area. In the full system, a laminar outflow in the burner holes was observed even for nominal loads of 25.8 kW [9]. Scaling the burner dimensions is therefore not disturbed by turbulent structures. Consequently, the resulting flow field above the perforated-plate burner is laminar, too. The original multi-hole burner had a locally different hole pattern with burner hole diameters of 0.6 mm and 1.0 mm, a spatially varying porosity, and a complex internal flow field induced by a swirler. To enable a better comparison of resolved simulation and experiment, the perforated-plate burner was designed to obtain a homogeneous flame structure with well-defined boundary conditions. The perforated plate has a homogeneous, hexagonally arranged hole pattern with a constant hole diameter of 1.0 mm. The porosity of the plate matches the global porosity of the original multi-hole burner and amounts to 0.31. Diameter and thickness of the perforated plate are 50.0 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively. The burner test bench, which is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 , consisted of an insulated steel cylinder with the perforated plate mounted at the outlet. Fuel and oxidizer streams were adjusted by mass flow controllers (MFC) and premixed upstream of the burner inlet. The uncertainty of the MFCs amounts to 0.2% of the maximum and 0.8% of the current mass flow. A flow heater in the oxidizer line allowed to control the unburnt temperature of the premixed gas. A mixing device consisting of a baffle plate and a mixing section ensured a homogeneous fuel/oxidizer mixture at the burner exit. Behind the mixing device, a sintered metal plate eliminated velocity inhomogeneities of the gas flow. To minimize boundary layer effects at the wall, a contoured duct was used. The temperature of the unburnt premixed gas was measured with two K-type thermocouples, one below the perforated plate and one below the sintered metal. The edge of the perforated plate was wrapped up with insulating material to minimize heat losses to the steel cylinder. All experiments were carried out at a fixed load point of 0.77 kW, which refers to a load point of the original condensing gas boiler with high NO x emissions. Three different fuel mixtures, which represent different types of natural gas according to the European norm DIN EN 437 [30], were studied: G20 (100% methane), G21 (87% methane and 13% propane), and G222 (77% methane and 23% hydrogen). The oxidizer was air and the equivalence ratio was set to Φ = 0.8 for all fuel-air mixtures. The unburnt gas temperature was set to 313 K to account for preheating effects of the condensing gas boiler. All measurements were conducted at atmospheric pressure."
3,Temperature and NO x measurements,"2.2 Temperature and NO x measurements An Al 2 O 3 -coated fine gauge bare wire R-type thermocouple from OMEGA with a bead diameter of 0.6 mm was employed for gas temperature measurements. The manufacturer specifies the measurement error below ± 2.5 K. The thermocouple is mounted in a constant-tension thermocouple configuration [37]. In hot environments, particularly radiative heat losses bias thermocouple measurements. Hence, a correction routine based on the approach of Shaddix [38] was applied. Details of this procedure can be found in the supplemental material Appendix A.1. To measure local NO x concentrations, a deactivated stainless steel tubing (1.5875 mm x 1.0 mm ID) was utilized for gas sampling. Since stainless steel is thermally more stable than quartz glass, a smaller probe could be used. This increased the accessibility and the spatial resolution of the measurement compared to common quartz glass probes. It was noted by England et al. [39] that catalytic reduction reactions of NO with unburnt hydrocarbons and CO can occur in stainless steel probes for nearly-stoichiometric to fuel-rich mixtures. Therefore, the NO x measurements in the flame front might be affected, because noteworthy amounts of CO and other hydrocarbon species are present. The results in the post-flame region are not affected though due to the lean conditions used. The sampling probe was connected to a wet chemiluminescence detector (NGA2000 WCLD manufactured by Rosemount) for analysis. The analyzer was calibrated with a reference gas mixture consisting of 90 ppm NO in N 2 . The measurement error is specified by the manufacturer as 1% for the measurement range of 100 ppm, which results in an error of ± 1 ppm. The thermocouple and sampling probe were consecutively mounted on the skid of a linear guide unit, which allowed automatic vertical displacement above the perforated plate. The relative spatial uncertainty is specified by the manufacturer (Rose+Krieger) to 0.5%. Measurements were performed ranging from the burner surface (0 mm) to 14 mm above the burner. For each height above the burner, data was recorded with 10 measurements per second over a period of 20 s, resulting in 200 measurements per position. Three measurement sequences were performed for each condition to acquire a reliable dataset. The profiles shown for temperature and NO x concentration are based on the mean values of the three measurement sequences. The solid temperature of the perforated plate was recorded using a K-type thermocouple from OMEGA with an outer diameter of 0.25 mm and a measurement accuracy of ± 2.5 K. The thermocouple was inserted from downstream into a blind hole in the center of the plate with a diameter of 0.3 mm and depth of 0.5 mm. To bond the thermocouple to the plate, a high temperature ceramic adhesive from OMEGA was applied."
4,Numerical framework,"In order to gain a deeper understanding of NO x formation, resolved simulations including finite rate chemistry were performed. For this, the in-house simulation code CIAO of the Institute for Combustion Technology was used [40]. The details of the numerical framework are described in Ref. [9]. The perforated-plate burner was designed to obtain spatially uniform laminar inflow and plate temperature profiles resulting in a homogeneous premixed flame. This along with the symmetry of the perforated plate was used to isolate a small hexagonal unit cell. According to Goswami et al. [41], it is reasonable to approximate this unit cell by an axisymmetrical cell of a single burner hole. The 2D simulation domain is rotationally periodic with the axis of rotation passing through the center of the burner hole. A schematic diagram of the perforated plate and the resulting simulation domain are illustrated in Fig. 2 . The simulation domain starts just upstream of the perforated plate and ends 15 mm above. A velocity inlet and an outflow boundary condition were applied. The radial dimension amounts to 0.895 mm to capture the porosity of the perforated plate. Slip and no-flux boundary conditions were prescribed at the round edge of the domain. The surface of the burner plate was defined as no-slip wall with a Dirichlet boundary condition for the plate temperature. In order to resolve the velocity field within the burner hole, 2D cold flow simulations have been performed beforehand and a radial grid resolution of 30 cells in the area of the burner hole was derived. The grid resolution around the flame front was estimated prior to the resolved simulations by 1D simulations of unstretched premixed flames using FlameMaster [42–44]. The area of the flame in axial direction was resolved with 60 cells along the flame front to accurately capture temperature and species gradients. The resulting numerical grid consisted of 49,050 cells. The smallest cell size used in the numerical grid was 5.8 µm and the corresponding time step size amounted to 2.3 µs. Simulations for three fuel mixtures of G20, G21, and G222 were performed at atmospheric pressure using an equivalence ratio of Φ = 0.8 and an inlet gas temperature of T u = 313 K. The inlet velocities were specified from the experimental mass flow rates. The perforated plate temperatures were derived from the experimental measurements and are summarized together with the other boundary conditions in Table 1 . In addition, laminar burning velocities and adiabatic flame temperatures for all fuel mixtures have been evaluated from 1D simulations of unstretched premixed flames using FlameMaster. These flame characteristics support the evaluation of stand-off distances, flame heat losses, and burnt gas temperatures and are also listed in Table 1. To represent the laminar burner-stabilized flame within the simulation, the Navier-Stokes equations in cylindrical formulation were solved in the low-Mach number limit as described by Desjardins et al. [40]. Within the species transport equations, diffusivity was derived from the unity Lewis number assumption for all species except for hydrogen. For hydrogen, a constant non-unity Lewis number was utilized ( L e H 2 = 0.269 and L e H = 0.161 ), which was evaluated in the burnt gas region of a 1D unstretched premixed flame simulation [45]. The assumption of unity Lewis numbers for all species except for hydrogen was verified by simulations of unstretched premixed flames, which resulted in the same temperature and species concentration profiles as if all Lewis numbers were set to constant non-unity values. Species diffusion due to temperature gradients (Soret effect), thermal conduction due to species gradients (Dufour effect) as well as heating due to viscous dissipation were neglected. In contrast to the condensing gas boiler, the perforated-plate burner represents an open system, where radiation effects are important. Therefore, radiation heat losses were considered by the optically thin gas (OTG) model. Most reaction mechanisms in literature focusing on the formation of nitric oxides also contain species and reactions for the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels. NO x formation cannot be considered separately from the hydrocarbon part of the mechanism, because the latter determines the radical concentrations and temperature level of the flame. As NO is extremely sensitive to these quantities, an unbiased comparison of different NO sub-mechanisms is only possible, when the identical mechanism for the hydrocarbon combustion serves as a basis. Usually, there is a one-way coupling between NO formation and hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, i.e. the fuel oxidation affects the NO formation, but inversely NO formation has only a marginal impact on the main hydrocarbon oxidation process. This allows to couple different NO sub-mechanisms with one hydrocarbon mechanism as a basis. In the current study, the hydrocarbon part of the mechanism from Blanquart et al. [46] is used as reference and coupled with different NO sub-mechanisms. The mechanism from Blanquart et al. [46] contains 149 species and 1651 reactions and was initially designed for engine-relevant fuels. The oxidation of smaller alkanes is derived from the well validated GRI 3.0 mechanism [47], where only a few rates have been updated according to recent findings [45,46]. Recently, a reduced version of this mechanism was applied to lean, premixed methane-air flames in several studies [9,45], where the mechanism showed good agreement with measured temperature and CO mole fraction data. The formation of the methylidyne radical (CH), which initiates NO formation via the prompt pathway, is included in the hydrocarbon mechanism and is therefore identical for all flames and NO sub-mechanisms. Originally, the mechanism from Blanquart et al. [46] included the NO sub-mechanism of the GRI 2.11 with 9 species and 73 reactions [48]. Besides, the NO sub-mechanism of the GRI 3.0 [47] with 17 species and 212 reactions is considered in the current study. Compared to the more recent mechanisms discussed next, these might be outdated, but they have been used in several recent studies focusing on NO x formation [9,25,29,34,45,49]. The GRI mechanisms are well-known and often serve as a reference for more recent mechanisms. To examine the development in the understanding of NO formation processes, the NO sub-mechanisms of the GRI 2.11 and GRI 3.0 are compared to more recent NO sub-mechanisms like the CRECK mechanism by Faravelli et al. [18] and Frassoldati et al. [19,22], and the very recent mechanism by Glarborg et al. [2]. The CRECK mechanism contains 30 species and 260 reactions and is applicable to low and high temperature ranges [18,19]. Later, it was extended to capture the NO formation in hydrogen-air flames [22]. Glarborg et al. [2] published a very comprehensive review article on the four different NO formation pathways. Their focus was on revising rate coefficients and activation energies based on existing experimental data and theoretical work. The revised NO sub-mechanism is the most detailed one considered in the present study and includes 82 species and 1528 reactions. The details of the NO sub-mechanisms used are summarized in Table 2 . Besides these NO sub-mechanisms, plenty of other mechanisms focusing on NO formation have been published [10–13,21,23–26]. Lamoureux et al. [25] developed an NO sub-mechanism named NOmecha2.0, which was coupled to the hydrocarbon mechanism of the GDFKin3.0 from El Bakali et al. [21]. Another mechanism on NO formation was published by Shrestha et al. [26], who extended the NOmecha2.0 mechanism for NO x formation in ammonia-air flames. The hydrocarbon mechanism as well as NO x chemistry has been validated for freely propagating and burner-stabilized premixed flames, shock-tube, jet-stirred reactor, and plug-flow reactor experiments [26]. However, both mechanisms have only been validated for premixed methane-air flames at low pressures, which does not match the conditions considered in this study."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Methane flame validation,"4.1 Methane flame validation To study the four different NO sub-mechanisms, the simulation results along the centerline f or pure methane (G20) are compared to the experimentally measured data. In Fig. 3 a, it can be seen that all simulation results exhibit exactly the same temperature profile, which is caused by the identical hydrocarbon mechanism used as a basis for the different NO sub-mechanisms. In addition, all non-nitrogen radical profiles are identical for the four simulations, which proves that NO x formation does not influence the fuel oxidation for condensing gas boiler operating conditions. This enables an unbiased comparison of the different NO sub-mechanisms, which is not affected by varying temperatures or radical concentrations. The profiles of the most important radicals initiating NO x formation (O, OH, H, and CH) are illustrated in Fig. A.9 in the supporting material in Appendix A. Until a height above burner (HAB) of 1.0 mm, the experimental temperature is higher than in the simulation. This was already found previously and explained by large temperature gradients in radial direction, which could not be resolved by the experiment due to the dimensions of the thermocouple bead [9]. Moreover, thermocouple measurements represent an invasive technique affecting the flame and flow field especially close to the burner surface. At 1.0 mm HAB, the experimental temperature profile shows a characteristic peak, which is not visible in the simulated profiles. The origin for this peak is assumed to also result from the invasive measurement technique. The thermocouple is strongly glowing when it is inserted into the hot region. The radiation of the thermocouple bead preheats the cold unburnt mixture leaving the burner hole of the perforated plate, which increases the enthalpy level of the flame. This measurement artifact is amplified by the plate itself, since its surface partially reflects the radiation. The effect quickly vanishes when the thermocouple is moved further away from the perforated plate, because the radiation of the thermocouple bead spreads spherically to a larger area and the local preheating effect reduces simultaneously. This effect was also visible in the measured temperature profiles of Bohon et al. [36], who did thermocouple along with OH LIF thermometry measurements. The same characteristic peak is also visible for the other fuel mixtures G21 and G222. In the post-flame region, the simulated temperature level is located above the experimental profile. However, in light of the uncertainties of the temperature measurements due to radiation correction, simulation and experiment show reasonably good agreement. At 3.0 mm HAB, the simulated temperature lies 53.8 K or 2.94% above the experimental measured level. In addition, the slope of the temperature profile in the post-flame region due to gas radiation effects and the predicted stand-off distance match well between simulation and experiment. In Fig. 3b, the simulated NO x mole fraction profiles of the four mechanisms along the centerline are displayed together with the experimentally measured data. At the burner surface, the experiment determines a NO x concentration of 8.82 ppm, while the simulation does not predict any NO x , because the gas is still unburnt at that position. Similar to the thermocouple measurements, probe sampling measurements represent an invasive technique, which impacts flame front and flow field close to the burner. Moreover, large gradients in radial direction cannot be resolved due to the dimensions of the gas sampling probe. The same behavior is found for the fuel mixtures G21 and G222. All simulations capture the experimental trend that NO x is only formed within and closely downstream of the flame front from 0.5 mm to 3.0 mm HAB. The NO sub-mechanism from Glarborg shows the best agreement with the experiment with a NO x mole fraction of 13.28 ppm at 14.0 mm HAB compared to 13.91 ppm of the experiment. This is closely followed by the CRECK mechanism, which reaches a final NO x mole fraction of 12.76 ppm. The predicted NO x levels of the GRI 3.0 and GRI 2.11 mechanisms are further below the experimental values with 12.13 ppm and 10.73 ppm, respectively. However, considering the uncertainties of the measurements, the radiation correction, and the usage of only one hydrocarbon mechanism, it is difficult to evaluate which NO sub-mechanism captures NO x formation in condensing gas boilers best by just regarding the total NO x profiles. Lamoureux et al. [25] investigated the impact of their experimental temperature uncertainty of 4 % on NO x formation and found a 30 % increase of NO x . Therefore, a more detailed analysis on NO x formation pathways was done for all NO sub-mechanisms."
7,Analysis of NO x formation pathways,"4.2 Analysis of NO x formation pathways To gain a deeper understanding how the thermal, prompt, NNH, and N 2 O pathways contribute to the total NO x concentration, a pathway analysis according to Trisjono et al. [45] is performed. Details of the procedure are outlined in the supporting material Appendix A.3. In Fig. 4 , the contributions of these four pathways are integrated along the domain and correlated to the total NO x formation. While the total NO x concentration for the different NO sub-mechanisms only varies by 2.6 ppm or 19.5 %, the integrated contributions for the different pathways differ significantly. The Glarborg NO sub-mechanism predicts the largest contribution by the prompt pathway with 59.6 %, which is much larger than the 17.1% to 37 % determined by the other mechanisms. For the GRI 2.11, GRI 3.0 and CRECK NO sub-mechanisms, the NNH pathway is a major NO x formation route with shares ranging from 35.4 % to 44.3 %. In contrast to this, the NNH pathway only plays a minor role in the Glarborg NO sub-mechanism with a contribution of 15 %. Regarding the remaining NO x formation pathways, only small fractions of NO x are formed via the thermal pathway, which are roughly similar for all NO sub-mechanisms. The contributions of the N 2 O pathway vary from 0 % to 21.8 % for the different NO sub-mechanisms. To further analyze the cause for these significantly varying contributions between the different NO sub-mechanisms, net production rate profiles of each pathway for all mechanisms are shown in Fig. 5 . As can be seen in Fig. 5a, the prompt pathway is only active within the flame, since it requires CH or CH 2 radicals, which cannot be found in the post-flame region for lean premixed conditions. Comparing the different NO sub-mechanisms, a clear chronological trend of increasing prompt formation rates is visible. The oldest NO sub-mechanism of the GRI 2.11 predicts a net formation rate, which is more than three times smaller than the one determined by the most recent mechanism of Glarborg et al. [2]. The GRI 2.11 only considers N 2 + CH ⇌ HCN + N as initiating reaction of the prompt pathway, which was postulated by Fenimore [50]. The GRI 3.0 and the CRECK mechanisms also consider this reaction, even though ab-initio molecular orbital calculations have shown that this reaction does not conserve the electron spin [51]. Instead, the reaction N 2 + CH ⇌ NCN + H was proposed by Moskaleva and Lin [52], which is used in the Glarborg NO sub-mechanism. The corresponding reaction rate coefficients used by Glarborg et al. [2] are much larger than those used in the other NO sub-mechanisms. This follows a recent study from Klippenstein et al. [53], who reanalyzed the reaction rates of important prompt NO reactions. Except for the GRI 2.11, all mechanisms contain further reactions belonging to the prompt pathway, e.g. N 2 + CH ⇌ HNCN , but these reactions play a minor role under condensing gas boiler operating conditions. In Fig. 5b, the net formation rates of the NNH pathway are displayed. Closely behind the flame front, this pathway reaches its chemical equilibrium and therefore does not further contribute to the total NO x formation. The initiation reaction N 2 + H ⇌ NNH produces significant amounts of NNH. However, most of the NNH produced is directly reburned via NNH + O 2 ⇌ N 2 + HO 2 . Only small amounts of NNH finally form NO via NNH + O ⇌ NO + NH . The small net formation rates of the NNH pathway determined by the Glarborg NO sub-mechanism refer to studies from Haworth et al. [54] and Klippenstein et al. [55], who noted that the importance of the NNH pathway was severely overestimated in previous mechanisms. These recent findings on NO x formation via the NNH and prompt pathway reveal some kind of error compensation for the GRI and CRECK mechanisms, where the overestimated contributions of the NNH pathway are balanced by underestimated formation rates of the prompt pathway. The thermal pathway, which is displayed in Fig. 5c, is the simplest NO formation pathway. All NO sub-mechanisms consider N 2 + O ⇌ NO + N as the only initiating reaction and the corresponding net formation rates vary by less than 50 % between the different mechanisms. The thermal pathway is the only pathway contributing to NO x formation in the post-flame region. However, the temperature level is rather low due to the lean mixture, flame heat losses to the perforated plate and due to gas radiation, which decreases the production of thermal NO x to almost insignificant levels. The profiles of the N 2 O pathway in Fig. 5d exhibit negative and positive net production rates in the flame front for the Glarborg and the two GRI mechanisms. The initiating reaction N 2 + O ⇌ N 2 O , which competes with the thermal pathway, produces by far the largest amount of N 2 O compared to the other initiating reactions. While significant parts of the N 2 O produced are reburned via N 2 O + H ⇌ N 2 + OH , only a small fraction is converted to NO via N 2 O + H ⇌ NO + NH . In the post-flame region, the N 2 O pathway reaches its chemical equilibrium. The profile of the CRECK NO sub-mechanism significantly differs from all other mechanisms, because only negative net formation rates are found within the flame front. Here, N 2 O is formed via NNH + O ⇌ N 2 O + H , which is then reburned to N 2 . This explains the negative net formation rates and the zero contribution of the N 2 O pathway to the total NO x emissions predicted by the CRECK mechanism. While this reaction channel is not considered in the GRI mechanisms, its importance is much smaller in the Glarborg mechanism than in the CRECK mechanism. The strong interaction between the N 2 O and NNH pathway was also discussed by Bohon et al. [36]. Concluding the comparison of the four NO sub-mechanisms studied, the agreement with the experimental data is acceptable for all mechanisms, taking the uncertainties of the measurements, the radiation correction, and the hydrocarbon mechanism into account. However, the detailed pathway analysis revealed error compensation effects for the GRI 2.11, GRI 3.0, and CRECK mechanisms, where the contribution of the NNH pathway was overestimated and the NO x formation via the prompt pathway was underestimated. Only the NO sub-mechanism from Glarborg et al. [2], which also showed the best agreement with the measured NO x concentration profile, did not show this behavior and is therefore the best of the studied NO sub-mechanisms for the application in condensing gas boiler conditions."
8,Effect of hydrogen and propane addition on NO x formation,"4.3 Effect of hydrogen and propane addition on NO x formation To study the effect of partially substituting methane by hydrogen or propane on NO x formation, the fuel mixtures G222 (77 % methane and 23 % hydrogen as molar fractions) and G21 (87 % methane and 13 % propane as molar fractions) are compared to the reference fuel G20 (100 % methane). As the previous section identified the NO sub-mechanism from Glarborg et al. [2] to represent NO x formation under condensing gas boilers best, this mechanism was also used for the G222 and G21 flames. Computed and measured temperature profiles of the G222 and G21 flames in Fig. 6 a and b show good agreement. The simulated temperature of G222 deviates by 50.5 K or 2.8 % from the experiment at 3.0 mm HAB. For G21, the difference amounts to 15.8 K or 0.86 % at the same axial position. The addition of hydrogen increases the adiabatic flame temperature compared to pure methane as listed in Table 1. However, the post-flame temperature remains nearly unchanged in comparison with G20. This is caused by higher flame heat losses to the burner due to an also increasing laminar burning velocity. This conclusion is supported by the experimental measurement of the perforated plate temperature. For G222, a plate temperature of 765 K was recorded compared to a plate temperature of 728 K for G20, which was shown in Table 1. The substitution of methane by propane leads to a higher adiabatic flame temperature compared to pure methane as illustrated in Table 1. While a higher flame temperature would increase the flame heat losses to the burner, the slightly smaller laminar burning velocity of G21 compensates this effect. This is supported by the measured plate temperature of 732 K for G21, which is only 4 K higher than for G20. In Fig. 6c and d, the NO x mole fraction profiles of G222 and G21 are displayed. For G222, NO x is only formed within and just behind the flame front, which is correctly represented by the simulation. The profiles of simulation and experiment match reasonably well with NO x mole fractions of 11.74 ppm and 11.10 ppm at 14.0 mm HAB. This represents a relative deviation of 5.45 %. For G21, the simulation underestimates the NO x level found in the experiment by 31.83 % with 12.85 ppm compared to 18.85 ppm at 14.0 mm HAB. The experiment detects a small but steady rise of the NO x profile in the post-flame region. This is not visible in the simulated NO x profile, even though the simulation slightly overpredicts the temperature level in the post-flame region. One explanation for the deviating NO x formation might be the radical concentration in the flame front and post-flame zone resulting from the hydrocarbon mechanism. This was also suggested by Bohon et al. [36], who studied lean premixed propane-air flames and found noteworthy deviations between simulation and experiment. The hydrocarbon mechanism of Blanquart et al. [46] was not specifically validated to capture the flame characteristics of propane, which might affect the results of the G21 flame. To further study the deviation of the NO x concentration for G21 and gain a deeper insight into the effect of the fuel composition on the individual NO x formation routes, a pathway analysis is performed. In Fig. 7 , the integrated NO x mole fractions resulting from the prompt, thermal, NNH, and N 2 O pathways are illustrated for G20, G21, and G222. The contributions of the NNH, thermal, and N 2 O pathways vary only slightly for the three fuel mixtures. Only the prompt pathway, which is most important for all fuel mixtures, shows significant differences depending on the fuel mixture. G20 exhibits the highest contribution from the prompt pathway with 7.92 ppm. For G222, the determined contribution of the prompt pathway is 1.59 ppm lower than for G20, even though the temperature level is nearly the same. G21 shows the highest temperature level, but it exhibits a lower integrated NO x mole fraction with 6.79 ppm than for G20. It can be concluded that the temperature level is not the most important driving factor of the prompt pathway. Therefore, the CH mole fraction profile is analyzed in Fig. 8 , which represents the most important radical to initiate the consumption of nitrogen via this pathway. G222 shows the lowest CH concentration in the flame front, which is caused by a lower amount of carbon atoms in the fuel mixture. G20 shows the highest CH concentration of all fuel mixtures, which explains the overall largest contribution of the prompt pathway to the total NO x emissions. Finally, G21 shows a lower CH concentration than G20 despite the higher amount of carbon atoms in the fuel mixture, which justifies the lower contribution of the prompt pathway. This agrees with findings from Bakali et al. [21], who noted that substituting methane by propane decreases the CH concentration in the flame."
9,Summary and conclusion,"Modern condensing gas boilers exhibit relatively low temperature levels, which significantly reduces the importance of the thermal pathway to the total NO x emissions. Instead, other formation routes become more important. Moreover, a high fuel-flexibility is necessitated from novel condensing gas boilers to take into account the emerging role of advanced fuels from renewable resources, such as hydrogen. These topics have been addressed in the current study by performing detailed numerical and experimental analyses of NO x formation in premixed burner-stabilized flames under condensing gas boiler conditions using a generic perforated-plate burner. The GRI 2.11 [48] and the GRI 3.0 [47] mechanisms, which have been developed some time ago, but have been used in several recent studies on NO x formation [9,25,29,34,45,49], were compared to more recent, detailed NO sub-mechanisms from the CRECK mechanism [18,19,22] and the mechanism from Glarborg et al. [2]. The Glarborg NO sub-mechanism showed the best agreement with the experimental NO x data for pure methane (G20), but also the other mechanisms agreed fairly well. However, a detailed pathway analysis revealed error compensation effects for the GRI and CRECK mechanisms, where the contribution of the NNH pathway was overestimated, which was then balanced by too small prompt formation rates. Consequently, the Glarborg mechanism turned out to be the best mechanism of the ones studied to capture NO x in condensing gas boiler applications. As expected, the thermal pathway exhibited a small contribution to the total NO x concentration. The NNH and N 2 O pathways quickly reached their chemical equilibrium behind the flame front, which limited their contribution to the NO x emissions. The prompt pathway, which is only active within the flame front under condensing gas boiler conditions, turned out to be the major NO x formation route. The effect of partially substituting methane by hydrogen increases the adiabatic flame temperature. However, the post-flame temperature of the methane/hydrogen mixture (G222) remains nearly unchanged compared to pure methane. This is caused by higher flame heat losses due to an also increased laminar burning velocity. The resulting NO x emissions of G222 are lower than for G20 as predicted by simulation and experiment. This originates from lower CH concentrations in the flame front, which mainly influence the NO x formation rate of the most important prompt pathway. The partial substitution of methane by propane leads to an increased post-flame temperature due to a higher adiabatic flame temperature and a slightly smaller laminar burning velocity. While the temperature profile is predicted very well by the simulation, the NO x level of methane/propane (G21) is underestimated in comparison with the experiment. A pathway analysis identified the prompt pathway as the major NO x formation route. For G21, the CH concentration was found to be lower than for G20 despite a higher carbon content. The major relevance of the prompt pathway to NO x formation has to be taken into account in future efforts to reduce NO x emissions of condensing gas boilers. Besides, the sensitivity of the prompt pathway to the CH concentration in the flame front highlights the requirement towards the hydrocarbon mechanism. As discussed by Pillier et al. [20], Williams et al. [33], and Glarborg et al. [2], important CH formation reactions exhibit large uncertainties. This necessitates a further validation of the hydrocarbon mechanism used to represent lean premixed burner-stabilized flames under condensing gas boiler conditions."
