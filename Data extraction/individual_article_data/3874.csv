0,Introduction,"Syngas, a mixture of CO and H2, plays an important role in clean production and utilization of energy resources, and the reproducible utilization of biomass resources, especially in making liquid fuels and chemical products via non-oil routes [1–4]. Higher alcohol synthesis (HAS) can be served as fuel additive and liquid fuels, and they are also important chemical raw materials [5,6]. To transform the syngas into HAS is one of the most important routes to realize efficient energy utilization and change the energy structure [7]. Due to the overproduction of methanol, the key of catalyzing syngas to HAS is to reduce the selectivity of methanol and improve the selectivity of high-value C2+ alcohol [8–10]. Due to the high selectivity and low cost, modified Fischer–Tropsch catalyst, especially Co−Cu, has attracted the most attention and is considered as one of the most promising catalysts to transform syngas into HAS [11–13]. Enormous efforts have been made to explore the mechanism for chain growth toward higher oxygenates. And CO insertion model, in which the chain growth is achieved by inserting CO into alkyl intermediates (CHX), has been generally accepted [14,15]. Through the mechanism of CO insertion model, CHX is an important precursor. Among the reactions on Cu-based catalysts, the formation of methanol occupies the most in total alcohol. Because of a competition between CHX and methanol, to boost the CHX is beneficial for the production of C2+ alcohol [8,9]. To the best of our knowledge, a few theoretical studies of the role of surface hydroxyl for this reaction have been reported. Gunasooriya et al. reported that surface hydroxyl groups may be involved in the reaction of CO activation on the face centered-cubic (fcc) Co(111) surface [16]. They presented a new OH-mediated pathway, which avoids the formation of H2CO (an intermediate which can be easily hydrogenated to form methanol), but favors the formation of COH and the subsequent CHOH (an intermediate which undergoes C−O scission with a low barrier to form CH). Liu et al. made a comparison between H- and OH-assisted CO activation on the flat hexagonal close packed (hcp) Co(0001) surface [17]. They found that H-assisted reaction route prefers HCO formation while in OH-assisted reaction route, COH formation is more preferred, and the latter is more favored than the former kinetically. But the low surface OH coverage on Co surface does not favor OH-assisted reaction route. Gerard et al. [18] and Julien et al. [15] have proved the existence of OH on the surface with experimental methods in realistic Fischer-Tropsch system but not mentioned the concentration of the coverages. Helden et al. [19] compared the results of their microkinetic model with the SSITKA results by Den Breejen et al., they pointed out that the OHx* species play prominent roles and some of these species are present at relatively high coverage (the value of θOH is around 1.83 × 10−4 ∼ 0.016 ML on different sites of cobalt). However, no systematical theoretical work has been done on the role of surface hydroxyl for this reaction system on Co−Cu surfaces. As Co−Cu catalysts are the most recognized catalytic system for this reaction, figuring out the effect of OH will help improve the catalytic performance in experiments and industrial processes. Experiment and theoretical studies about the Co−Cu bimetal surface has been made by different groups. The previous experiment studies clarified the growth situation of Co on Cu(111). With the help of STM and LEED, Figuera et al. gave the conclusion that cobalt grows initially on Cu(111) in the form of bilayer islands with the shape of triangles of alternate orientation [20]. They also found the film grows with strict fcc stacking. Pedersen et al. found that one Co layer is buried in the Cu surface [21]. And Diekhöner et al. also verified the well-known compact islands of triangular shape and bilayer height [22]. Besides, the CuCo catalysts were also experimentally studied. The study of Somerjai group [23] has shown the richment of copper in the shell, and they [24] also give the Cu/Co atomic ratio of 1.4. The similar result can be found in the work of Carenco [25], when exposed to model syngas, NPs were highly depleted in cobalt. Besides, Carenco et al. [26]confirmed the shell morphologies with Cu/Co ratios of 9.5:0.5 as revealed by EDS. In addition to that, the study of Collinge et al. [27,28] declared that CO-induced a surface restructuring during which Co is chemically “pumped” to the surface. Some density functional calculations were performed to study the structures of Co−Cu bimetallic catalysts. Wang et al. applied the chain growth mechanism on the Cu(111)/Co surface [29], which is depicted to be a Co sublayer placed at the substrate of Cu(111). Xu et al. used the model where 2/3 of surface atoms in Co(0001) were substituted by Cu atoms [30], and it results in a surface configuration of a triangular Co ensemble surrounded by 6 Cu atoms. However, it is found that a Cu-rich surface is observed when exposed to syngas atmospheres [25,31,32]. So, we decide to apply a Co-doped Cu(111) surface. Fu et al. calculated the energy for the configurations with separated and aggregated alloying atoms on Cu(111) [33], they found that for the structure containing three doping atoms, the Fe, Co, Ru, Os, and Ir tend to form the aggregated trimer structure instead of the separated one, they also concluded that under the hydrogen-rich environments, most of the alloyed metal atoms (except Fe), can stably occupy the top surface layer (while Co prefers the subsurface layer in vacuum, Co atoms are drawn up to the top surface layer under the hydrogen-rich environments). And also, according to the study by Greeley et al. [34], adsorbed hydrogen on the surface can draw the metal atom to the surface layer of the alloy system under the actual conditions of hydrogenation. Xu and co-workers [30] also perform calculations about syngas reaction with different Co arrangements and reveal that Co atoms prefer to aggregate in thermodynamics. Their results show a surface configuration of a triangular Co ensemble surrounded by 6 Cu atoms. Zhang et al. implied the model that three Cu atoms on the Cu(111) surface were substituted by other transition metals in each unit cell [35]. Hence, we adopt the model of three doping Co atoms on Cu(111) surface, and above-mentioned results might be a support for our model in a certain degree. According to the above analyses, we determine to investigate the effect of surface hydroxyl on Co-doped Cu(111) surface when it comes to the competition between CHX and methanol. All elementary reactions from CO to CHX or CH3OH will be considered step by step to evaluate the possible participation of surface hydroxyl and whether the OH species is effective to promote the alkyl intermediates. And we expect this study will greatly improve the understanding of this reaction and the subsequent design of high-performance catalysts. This paper will be arranged as follows: In Section 2, we will describe the detailed model and computational methods we used. In Section 3, each structural and energetic feature of the initial, transition and final state of every elementary step from CO to CHX and CH3OH will be discussed in H- assisted and OH-assisted situation. And then we will compare these two routes. In Section 4, the conclusion of these study will be summarized."
1,Model and calculation methods,
2,Surface model,"2.1 Surface model Just as discussed in the Section “Introduction”, our model of 3 doping Co atoms on Cu(111) surface is based on the mentioned experiment and theoretical studies, and is considered reasonable. For the Co-doped Cu(111) surface, a three-layer Cu(111) -(4 × 4) supercell with a vacuum slab of 15 Å was employed, and then three of the surface atoms in the top layer of Cu(111) is substituted by Co atoms, which form the shape of aggregated Triangle. The bottom one layer was fixed in the bulk positions while the upper two layers as well as the adsorbates were allowed to relax during geometry optimization and transition state (TS) search."
3,Calculation method,"2.2 Calculation method Periodic plane-wave spin-polarized DFT calculations were carried out with the program package Dmol3 in Materials Studio of Accelrys Inc. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew−Burke−Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was used for the exchange and correlation effects in the calculations [36,37]. The basis set was set as double numerical plus polarization (DNP). A Fermi smearing of 0.006 Ha was adopted to accelerate the convergence and a 3 × 3 × 1 grid was used to generate k-points according to the Monkhorst–Pack method [38]. The convergence criteria for geometry optimization and energy calculations were set as 1.0 × 10−5 Ha, 2.0 × 10−5 Ha, 0.004 Ha Å−1, and 0.005 Å for the tolerance of self-consistent field (SCF), energy, maximum force, and maximum displacement, respectively. The TS search was performed at the same theoretical level as those for the reactants and products using the complete linear synchronous transit/quadratic synchronous transit (LST/QST) method [39,40]. The adsorption energy, Eads, is defined as given in Eq (1) (1) E ads = E adsorbates + E slab − E adsorbates / slab where Eadsorbates/slab, Eadsorbates and Eslab are the total energy of adsorbates on the surface slabs, the total energy of the free adsorbates and the total energy of bare surface slabs, respectively. The total energy of the free adsorbates was obtained after geometry optimization calculations of the isolated free adsorbates since Dmol3 can deal with periodic and non-periodic systems. The computational parameters are the same as those for geometry optimization calculations of the surface except the use of k-point since k-point control is active only for periodic systems. The details of the computational parameters for surface geometry optimization have been described above. The reaction energy ∆E is calculated as Eq (2) (2) Δ E = E FS − E IS The activation barrier Ea is defined as Eq (3) (3) E a = E TS − E IS where EIS, ETS and EFS refer to the total energy of the initial, transition, and final states, respectively."
4,Results and discussion,
5,CO and reaction intermediates,"3.1 CO and reaction intermediates Under the normal circumstances, researchers just study the single adsorption of reaction intermediates and the co-adsorption of reaction intermediates with H atom [41–43]. However, in this study, our purpose is to explore the effect of surface hydroxyl. It is important to realize the co-adsorption circumstances of reaction intermediates with OH or O. In this part, we mainly discuss the CO bond length changes in reaction intermediates and their adsorption energy changes in different adsorption environments. 3.1.1 Bond length of CO bond in different adsorption environments An important factor to increase the selectivity to CHX and inhibit CH3OH is to promote the bond-breaking of CO bond in the key reaction intermediates. The CO bond length of single CO molecule in our calculation is 1.142 Å which agrees well with the previous reports [44,45]. Just as listed in Table 1 , the bond length changes in different adsorption environments. Once they are adsorbed to the surface, the CO bond length extends to a certain degree for all reaction intermediates. But for these species, differences occur when they are co-adsorbed with H, OH and O, and the stable co-adsorption geometries can be seen in Figs. 1–3 . It can be seen in Table 1, when reaction intermediates are co-adsorbed with H atom, the CO length of most reaction intermediates changes very little, except HCOH and CH2OH. The CO bond length of HCOH increases from 1.329 Å to 1.335 Å, which is beneficial for the bond-breaking. While the bond length of CH2OH decreases from 1.498 Å to 1.486 Å, which would increase the bong-breaking difficulty. In short, the existence of H atom makes little change to the CO bond length of the most reaction intermediates. When hydroxyl is existing on the surface, the influence is bigger than that of H atom. Compared with the co-adsorption with H atoms, the CO bond length increases in different degrees for CO, COH, CHOH, CH2O and CH2OH. Among these reaction intermediates, only the CO bond length of HCO and CH3O decreases negligible (1.350 vs 1.349 and 1.447 vs 1.445) when compared with the co-adsorption with H atoms. In general, the existence of OH molecule is beneficial for the bond-breaking for the most reaction intermediates. And compared to the co-adsorption with H atoms, the existence of OH would help improve the CO bond-breaking ability, which would lead to an increase of CHX. The existence of O atom acts to be against the bond-breaking behavior. The data in Table 1 show that only the CO bond of CH2O and CH3O extend (1.320 vs 1.343 and 1.447 vs 1.451) while the others are all shortened to some degree when compared to the co-adsorption with H atom. For the purpose of checking the influence of the existence of OH and O atom on the surface, we also calculate another two adsorption environments: (1) reaction intermediates co-adsorption with H atom and OH; (2) reaction intermediates co-adsorption with H atom and O atom. The results are listed in Table 1, and the comparison results can be seen obviously in Fig. 4 . The CO bond length values of reaction intermediates co-adsorption with H atom and OH are almost between those of co-adsorption with H atom and co-adsorption with OH (except HCOH, CH2O,CH2OH, the value is even bigger). While values of reaction intermediates co-adsorption with H atom and O atom are even smaller than those with O atom. And all these make clear the positive role of hydroxyl (OH) and negative influence of O atom in CO bond-breaking behavior. 3.1.2 Adsorption energy in different adsorption environments Adsorption is an important step during surface reaction since the interaction between catalyst and adsorbate could influence the catalytic reactivity. The adsorption energy is always regarded as a measure of adsorbate–substrate adsorption strength. A lower adsorption energy is in favor of the migration of reaction intermediates among the active sites on the surface [46]. While a high adsorption energy will decrease the activation barrier of bond-breaking step to a great extent [47]. In co-adsorption environments, the lateral interactions (both repulsive and attractive) between surface species are expected to decrease the adsorption energies. Zhuo et al. reported that the hydrogen adsorption energy decreases a bit when adsorbed on a CO-covered Co(0001) surface due to the repulsive lateral interactions with neighboring CO molecules [46]. But in our study, CO and reaction intermediates are subjects of the study. So, we consider and compare the following four adsorption environments: single adsorption, co-adsorption with H atom, co-adsorption with OH, co-adsorption with O atom. The results are listed in Table 2 . The tendency can be seen in Fig. 5 , when co-adsorbed with H atoms, the adsorption energy of species except CH2O and CH2OH increases inordinately. A H-covered surface may enhance the adsorption ability for most reaction intermediates which will increase the migration difficulty of species and increase the reaction difficulty. However, when co-adsorbed with OH, the adsorption energy of all related species decreases compared to the situation of co-adsorption with H atom. It is even better that the adsorption energy of HCO, CH2O, CH2OH, CH3O is even lower than their single adsorption energy. We can draw a conclusion that a OH-covered surface can reflect the great lateral interactions and the existence of OH would result in a decrease in adsorption energy for most related reaction intermediates. The lateral interactions become more obvious when the reaction intermediates co-adsorb with O atom. It can be seen in Fig. 5 that the adsorption energy of all related reaction intermediates decrease to a certain extent compared to their single adsorption energy. The following conclusion can be made with the analysis of adsorption energy. Compared with the traditional co-adsorption calculation of reaction intermediates and H atoms, the existence of OH is beneficial for reaction intermediates in decreasing the adsorption energy, and improves the ability to migrate among the active sites on the surface. The O atom acts to be more effective and the effect is more obvious."
6,Hydrogenation and dissociation reactions,"3.2 Hydrogenation and dissociation reactions Based on aforementioned adsorption calculation of CO and the intermediate species, our core work proceeds with a total four-steps’ hydrogenation of CO and the dissociation of the relevant reaction intermediates. In this part, the comparison will be made among the H-assisted hydrogenation, OH-assisted hydrogenation and dissociation of the reaction intermediate species. The reaction network for CO hydrogenation and dissociation is displayed in Fig. 6 . The adsorbed CO can dissociate via H-assisted or OH-assisted hydrogenation to form CHX (x = 1–3), or just hydrogenate to form CH3OH. Adsorption configurations of the initial state, transition state, and final state of species involved in dissociation, H-assisted hydrogenation and OH-assisted hydrogenation will be respectively illustrated in the Supporting Information. Just as described in the network, reaction paths to CHX or CH3OH are concluded in the next section in our present DFT study, and the energetic features of these reactions can be seen in Table 3 ."
7,Comparison of these pathways,"3.3 Comparison of these pathways With the purpose of illustrating the effect of hydroxyl on the reaction, the calculation can be divided into three groups: OH-assisted hydrogenation, H-assisted hydrogenation, and CO bond-breaking. Starting from CO, as can be seen in Fig. 7 , the direct CO dissociation energy barrier (2.74 eV) is obvious too high and difficult to occur. When the hydrogenation of CO leads to COH or HCO, the H-assisted way prefers to produce CHO with an energy barrier of 1.50 eV. This agrees with some previous studies while their calculation did not take the hydroxyl into consideration. The result of OH-assisted hydrogenation agrees well with previous work by Gunasooriya et al. It can be seen that OH-assisted hydrogenation reaction helps reduce the energy barrier to COH to 1.17 eV [16], but rises the energy barrier to HCO from 1.50 eV to 2.09 eV, which is benefical for the produce of COH and avoids the HCO species. As shown in Fig. 8 , starting from COH and HCO, the reaction intermediate COH tends to directly dissociate to C species and OH with an energy barrier of 1.24 eV, while the H-assisted hydrogenation of COH has a relatively higher energy barrier of 1.80 eV, and the OH-assisted hydrogenation just reduces a little to 1.69 eV. The direct dissociation of HCO is a little difficult with barrier of 1.66 eV when compared with hydrogenation reactions. The H-assisted hydrogenation of HCO acts to favor the production of CH2O with energy barrier of 1.55 eV in contrast to HCOH with energy barrier of 2.67 eV. However, the OH-assisted way changes the preference. OH-assisted hydrogenation of HCO lowers the energy barrier to HCOH to only 0.94 eV, while it rises the energy barrier to CH2O a little to 1.60 eV. Beginning with HCOH and CH2O, as shown in Fig. 9 , the reaction intermediate HCOH is easy to directly dissociate to CH species and OH with activation barrier of 0.73 eV, while the hydrogenation of HCOH to CH2OH cannot compete (with 1.57 eV barrier for H-assisted hydrogenation and 1.17 eV barrier for OH-assisted hydrogenation). For the intermediate CH2O, the H-assisted hydrogenation is prone to the generation of CH3O with barrier of 0.63 eV while the OH-assisted way is inclined to generate CH2OH with barrier of 0.36 eV, and the direct dissociation reaction cannot compete with them (1.24 eV). As is shown in Fig. 10 , both the reaction intermediates CH2OH and CH3O can hydrogenate to methanol, but methanol is not desired in this reaction system, while CHX species are wanted to carry on the subsequent reactions. CH3O species is more easy to form methanol compared to CH2OH, while CH2OH species prefers to dissociate to the wanted intermediate CH2. CH2OH species only needs to overcome 0.46 eV to break the CO bond while CH3O species needs 1.34 eV. As was described above, CHXOH (X = 0∼2) species are inclined to break the CO bond while CHXO (X = 1∼3) species tend to undergo the hydrogenation reactions. Since Cu catalyst has studied to exhibit good catalytic performance for CH3OH formation from syngas, and previous study has found that H-assisted hydrogenation of CO prefers to produce the CHXO (X = 1∼3) species on Cu(100) [8], Cu(111) [9], Cu6Co3 [30], Cu∑5(310) [48], RhCu(211) [49]. While CHX formation is thought to be a key step for C2 oxygenates formation from syngas, more CHX sources should be obtained. Our calculation suggests that the OH-assisted hydrogenation prefers to form CHXOH (X = 0∼2) species, and these CHXOH (X = 0∼2) species are easier to form the wanted CHX than methanol. Namely, the existence of hydroxyl would result in high productivity and selectivity of C2+ alcohol from syngas on Cu-based catalyst by boosting more CHX and minimizing CH3OH formation."
8,Conclusion,"In this paper, a systematically periodic DFT study has been performed on the reaction mechanism of CO hydrogenation reactions via H-assisted and OH-assisted routes on Co-doped Cu(111) surface. It is found that the existence of OH can promote the hydrogenation reaction of CO to generate CHXOH (X = 0∼2) species more easily which tend to break into CHX (X = 0∼2) rather than CHXO (X = 1∼3) species which tend to hydrogenate to methanol. Hydroxyl is a favorable species for syngas-to-HAS reaction owing to its ability to boost more CHX and minimize CH3OH formation. The insight into the effect of surface hydroxyl on reaction selectivity can guide the design and modification of new catalysts for HAS."
