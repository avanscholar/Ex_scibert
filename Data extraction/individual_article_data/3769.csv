0,Introduction,"The synthesis of benzoaldehydes from the corresponding toluenes and benzyl alcohols by selective oxidation represents a fundamentally important process towards the production of a variety of fine chemicals [1–4]. Photocatalysis could serve as a prominent alternative strategy as it only consumes solar light and O2 and operates under extremely mild conditions [5–10]. Key to photocatalysis is a photocatalyst that exhibits appropriate optical properties to absorb solar light and high photocatalytic efficiency (e.g., selectivity and quantum yield) to trigger the transformations. Recent studies showed that TiO2 exhibits good catalytic activities and selectivities for oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BnOH) to benzaldehyde [6,7,11]. However, its application is generally limited by the inefficiency of harvesting visible light due to the wide band gap (3.2 eV). Alternatively, while structurally-modified TiO2 with visible light response is being exploited [12,13], other visible light active photocatalysts like CdS, C3N4 and BiOX (X = Cl, Br or I) are also extensively studied [5,8–10]. Despite these efforts, exploring new materials that harvest visible light and photocatalyze efficiently this chemical transformation remains to be a hard task and is still underway. Titanium-oxide clusters (TOCs) are a class of molecular compounds consisting of discrete TixOy cores which are passivated with terminating ligand shells. Recently, the research interests on the synthesis of TOCs have been rapidly growing [14–19]. As TOCs possess the typical structural features of the TiOx polymorphs of anatase, rutile or brookite, as well as electronic structures like those of TiO2 NPs, they are regarded as realistic mimics of TiO2 NPs to study the structure and optical properties, by both experiments and DFT calculations [20–28]. Importantly, this class of molecular materials has shown great potential in photocatalytic applications like hydrogen production and pollutant degradation, just as expected based on the knowledge of the well-known TiO2 photocatalysis [18]. However, on one hand, most of the photocatalytic studies used the crystalline, molecular TOCs as insoluble materials, namely, heterogeneous powders [17,18,29–34]. On the other hand, the HOMO-LUMO gaps of the neutral Ti-oxo alkoxides/carboxylates are even larger than that of TiO2, rendering the low efficiency of TOCs in harvesting solar energy [20,35,36]. While modification/incorporation of TOCs with chromophores [16,21,24,37] or metal ions [14,22,27,38] to enhance the light absorption properties has been systematically examined, nonmetal ion doping has not been investigated. We recently focus on the investigation of condensation of Ti4+ in acidic water and have isolated a few novel polyoxocationic TOCs which are different from the well-known neutral Ti-oxo alkoxides/carboxylates/other organic ligands prepared in organic solvents [16–19], and polyoxometalates which are polyoxoanionic [39–42]. Among them, the [Ti6O8(OH2)20]8+ (Ti6 ) cluster is unusual as it has the same composition as the known “metatitanic acid” [43–45], and may be regarded as a protonated (TiO2)6 molecule (Fig. 1 ). Also, it is highly soluble in many organic solvents like acetonitrile (MeCN), ethanol, and acetone possibly due to the co-existing tetrabutylammonium (TBA) ions. We envisioned that Ti6 may be a potential molecular photocatalyst alternative to the current heterogeneous, nanocrystalline materials. In this study, the Ti6 cluster modified with Br–, i.e., Ti6B, is used as an efficient photocatalyst for benzaldehyde synthesis under visible light irradiation and aerobic conditions. This system could tolerate many common substituents. It was found out that Br–-association brings about the improvement in both response of solar spectrum and photocatalytic efficiency of Ti6 . The structural stability of Ti6 during the photocatalysis and the formation of Ti-Br bond are supported by a set of evidences. Our results not only show the potentials of TOCs in photocatalytic selective oxidations using visible light, but also may be pertinent to understanding the mechanism of doping of TiO2 with non-metal elements."

All other chemicals were purchased from commercial sources and used as received."
3,Instruments,"2.2 Instruments 425 ± 7, 450 ± 8 and 475 ± 13 nm plant grow light LED chips were obtained from a domestic manufacturer. The spectra of the LEDs were reported previously [48]. A Xenon lamp was used to simulate sunlight (300 W input; Au light Co., China). FTIR spectra were measured using a PerkinElmer Spectrum Two FT-IR. UV–Vis spectra were measured on an Agilent Cary-60 spectrophotometer. Gas chromatography (GC) analysis was conducted with a GC-7900 instrument (Techcomp, China) equipped with an FID detector and a capillary column (TM-5, 60 m × 0.32 mm × 0.5 μm). Gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GC–MS) measurements were conducted using Shimadzu QP2010 SE system equipped with a capillary column (HP-5, 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.5 μm). High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses were performed on a Shimadzu LC-20A system equipped with a photodiode array detector and DIKMA Platisil ODS C-18 column, with MeCN (40 vol%) and H3PO4 aqueous solution (pH = 2.5; 60 vol%) as the eluents. 17O NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker 500 MHz Fourier transform NMR spectrometer in 5 mm NMR tubes. Electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements were performed using a JOEL X320 instrument at room temperature. Simulation of the spectra was performed using the WinSim software free of charge from NIEHS. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were collected using a ThermoFisher Scientific ESCALAB 250 instrument."
4,Small-angle X-ray scattering,"2.3 Small-angle X-ray scattering Data were collected on the Anton Paar SAXSess instrument utilizing Cu-Kα radiation (1.542 Å) and line collimation. Solution samples and backgrounds were measured in a sealed 1.5 mm diameter quartz capillary tube for 30 min. SAXSQUANT software was used for data collection and treatment (normalization, primary beam removal, background subtraction, desmearing, and smoothing to remove extra noise created by the desmearing routine). Analyses of the radius of gyration (R g), the extrapolated zero-angle intensity (I 0) and PDDF (pair distance distribution function, P(r)) were carried out using the SAS Data Analysis package in ATSAS 2.6.0 software."

The electronic absorption spectra were calculated based on time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) method. The effect of solvation was included in the calculations using the polarizable continuum model (PCM)."
6,Photocatalytic oxidation of toluenes,"2.5 Photocatalytic oxidation of toluenes In a typical experiment, 100 mg of Ti6B and 100 μL of HBr were added to 16.5 g (19 mL) of toluene in a Pyrex vial. Excess HBr was added as it was found that it improved the absorption properties of Ti6B. 5 g of MgSO4 was also added as a dehydrating agent. The reaction mixture was open to air, magnetically stirred and air-cooled with a fan to maintain room temperature. Evaporation of the solvent could be ignored as the vent of the vial was narrow. The vial was irradiated from the side with the 425 nm LED. After every certain time, ca. 1.0 μL of the solution was withdrawn and analyzed with GC or GC–MS. For the solid or liquid substrates of high viscosity, 20 mg of Ti6B, 100 μL of HBr, and 0.2 g of substrate were dispersed in 2 mL of CH3CN for the photocatalytic reactions."
7,Photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols,"2.6 Photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols Taking BnOH as an example, 25 mg of Ti6B, 100 μL of BnOH and 10 mL of MeCN were charged in a 20 mL Pyrex vial. The vial was sealed with a laminated rubber stopper, and then purged with O2 for 5 min. An oxygen balloon was connected to the vial to supply excess O2 during the reaction. The reaction mixture was magnetically stirred and irradiated with the Xenon lamp at ambient temperature. After every certain time, 0.5 mL of the solution was withdrawn by a syringe to which ca. 0.1 g of NaOH was added to precipitate the catalyst. The solution was filtered, quantitatively diluted with MeCN, and then analyzed by HPLC."
8,The spin trapping experiments,"2.7 The spin trapping experiments DMPO was used to trap the active oxygen species (AOS) for ESR measurements. For this, to a Ti6B/BnOH solution (10 g L−1) was added an aliquot of 0.2 M DMPO/BnOH to give final DMPO concentration of 70 μM. A 1.0 mm capillary filled with the above solution was mounted for the ESR measurements. The 300 W Xe lamp was used to illuminate the tube from the side during the measurements."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Photocatalytic selective oxidations under visible light irradiation,"3.1 Photocatalytic selective oxidations under visible light irradiation In solid state, the crystals of both Ti6C and Ti6B are almost colorless. However, when dissolved in dry MeCN, while the resultant Ti6C solution is still colorless, the Ti6B solution is yellow. The absorption edges of the two solutions are ca. 420 and 500 nm, respectively (Fig. 2 ). For syntheses of benzaldehyde, toluene is an ideal choice of precursor since it is inexpensively produced in industry [5,9,11,49]. Here, the photocatalytic activities of both Ti6C and Ti6B under visible light irradiation were initially examined using selective oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde as the model reaction (Table 1 ). The experiments were performed under non-solvent conditions. Hence, toluene acted as both the reactant and the solvent. A catalytic amount of Ti6B could efficiently harvest visible light to trigger this conversion under ambient conditions (entries 1–3). Monochromatic LEDs of 425, 450, and 475 nm were tested, and all showed high efficiencies. Interestingly, the conversion of toluene using 450 nm LED was higher than that using 425 nm LED. By contrast, toluene remained intact without light, Ti6B, or O2 (entries 4–6). Hence, Ti6B, light, and O2 are all essential in the oxidation of toluene. Different from Ti6B, Ti6C showed very low activity in the selective oxidation of toluene under otherwise identical conditions (entry 7). We also checked the activity of the commercial P25 TiO2. However, due to the wide bandgap of pristine TiO2 (3.0–3.2 eV) [6,7,11], P25 showed very low activity when irradiated with the 425 nm LED (entry 8). It appears that the conversion of toluene follows 0th kinetics within the first 30 h (Fig. 3 ). The rate constant can be determined as the slope of the first 30 h and the value is ca. 0.4 mmol h−1. The turnover number (TON), defined as the amount of converted toluene divided by the amount of added Ti6B, reached 288 in the first 22 h of reaction, showing this conversion is truly photocatalytic. PhCHO was the major product and its yield reached 3.7% after 22 h of reaction. Namely, as much as 0.72 g of PhCHO was produced out of the 16.5 g toluene, at the expense of costless sunlight in addition to a catalytic amount of Ti6B. The drastic formation of PhCOOH after 18 h caused the selectivity of PhCHO to decrease. Obviously, PhCHO is an intermediate of the consecutive reaction. Hence, its accumulation in the photocatalytic reaction is attributed to both the higher formation rate and the smaller conversion rate of it in the early stage of the reaction. Interestingly, BnBr which is a very useful organic compound in organic synthesis was also detected as a by-product. However, upon our optimization of the reaction conditions (e.g., amount of added HBr, reaction time, and temperature), the selectivity of benzyl bromide was always quite low. Thus, the Ti6B/visible light system could not be used to selectively produce BnBr from toluene. It was also observed that after 30 h the reaction became very slow, consistent with the gradually decomposition of Ti6B as discussed later. We compared the performance of Ti6B with some popular visible light-driven, heterogeneous semiconductor photocatalysts (Table S1). By rough comparison, we found out that Ti6B showed comparable performance with these photocatalysts. Encouraged by the above results, we further examined a variety of representative substituted alkylbenzenes to investigate the scope and the limitation of the Ti6B/visible light system (Table 2 ). To our delight, all these substrates showed good to excellent reactivities. The substituents at the benzene rings could affect the rate by electronic and steric effects (entries 1–7). However, they eventually exhibited little inhibition of the yields of the desired aldehydes. Moreover, ethylbenzene, n-propylbenzene and diphenylmethane were selectively oxidized to acetophenone, propiophenone and benzophenone (entries 8–10), respectively, suggesting Ti6B/visible light system could also be used to synthesize a variety of phenylketones from the corresponding alkylbenzenes. For the synthesis of PhCHO, BnOH as a chemical raw material has also been extensively used previously [5,8–10]. Hence, the activities of both Ti6B and Ti6C were investigated in the selective oxidation BnOH to PhCHO as well. For this, a Xenon lamp was used to simulate sunlight. The control experiment showed the conversion could not occur without a catalyst (Fig. S1). As indicated by the kinetics, PhCHO was efficiently synthesized from BnOH in the presence of Ti6B (Fig. 4 A). Its yield increased at the beginning of the reaction, reached 96% at 60 min, and then decreased gradually accompanied with the formation of PhCOOH. The process follows pseudo first-order kinetics with a k value of 0.0476 min−1 (Fig. S2). Hence, PhCHO is the kinetic intermediate during the oxidation of BnOH to PhCOOH. By contrast, using Ti6C under otherwise identical conditions, the conversion of BnOH was less than 15% after 80 min of reaction (Fig. 4B). Fig. 4C compares the temporal variation of TON values of both clusters. Clearly, Ti6B exhibits much higher efficiency in the photocatalytic selective oxidation of BnOH to PhCHO than Ti6C. The TON of Ti6B reached ca. 170 after 80 min of reaction. The reactivities of a variety of substituted benzyl alcohols were then examined (Table 3 ). Generally, all the terminal benzyl alcohols were rapidly converted to the corresponding aldehydes with high selectivities (entries 1–7), although the reaction rates varied with substituents. Internal benzyl alcohols like 1-phenethylethanol and diphenylmethanol could be successfully oxidized to the corresponding ketones with excellent yields (entries 8–9). We also examined the outcome of cinnamic alcohol as an example of allyl alcohols. However, the Ti6B/visible light system showed low activity and most of cinnamic alcohol was degraded (entry 10)."
11,Active oxygen species,"3.2 Active oxygen species To examine the active oxygen species (AOS) formed during the photocatalytic oxidation of BnOH, DMPO was added to capture the AOS and electron spin resonance (ESR) was adopted to determine the resultant adducts in situ. As shown in Fig. 5 , while the Ti6B/BnOH/DMPO system was ESR silent in the dark, it showed a set of sextet signals under irradiation for 15 s. The calculated hyperfine constants, i.e., aN = 13.7 and aH = 7.7, are typical of DMPO-OOH [50,51]. By contrast, the ESR signal of DMPO-OOH was hardly detected in the Ti6C/BnOH/DMPO system, indicating the activity of Ti6C for activation of O2 is much lower than Ti6B under light irradiation. This is consistent with the observed higher photocatalytic activities of Ti6B than Ti6C in the selective oxidations of both toluene and BnOH. Further, to examine the role of superoxide, p-benzoquinone which is an efficient superoxide quencher was added to the photocatalytic system. It was found that the conversion of BnOH was thoroughly quenched by 2 eqs of added p-benzoquinone (relative to BnOH; standard condition of Table 3). Hence, superoxide should be directly involved in the conversion of BnOH. In recent years, TOCs have been widely studied for photoelectric conversion, photocatalytic H2 evolution and dye degradation [18,29,52,53]. In these studies the photophysical and initial photochemical processes of TOCs are generally believed to be similar to semiconductor TiO2 as both have the similar band structures [16]. In this study, the Ti6 cluster features many –OH2 ligands on the surfaces just like a hydrated TiO2 nanoparticle. Therefore, we tentatively propose the selective oxidation reactions by Ti6B follow the previously reported TiO2 mechanism [54]. Under visible light irradiation, electrons are excited from Br− ligands to Ti3d orbitals, giving Br· as the oxidizing species [49] and Ti3+ as the reducing species. The binding of Br− to the Ti6 core will be discussed later (Section 3.4). In the subsequent photochemical processes, Br·, Ti3+ and O2 participate in the oxidation of BnOH to form PhCHO [54]. According to Zhao’s study, O2 initially forms an organic superoxide intermediate and subsequently a peroxide intermediate and finally H2O2. While the ESR measurements verify the presence of superoxide, the “DPD/POD” measurements [55–57] shown in Fig. S3 firmly indicates H2O2 was formed, both of which are consistent with the previous TiO2 mechanism [54]."
12,Stability of Ti6,"3.3 Stability of Ti6 In prior to understanding the origin of the visible light response of the Ti6 clusters by Br– modification, it is pivotal to elucidate the stability of Ti6 when dissolved in MeCN in the presence of the substrates. This is because many TOCs isolated from water are not stable when re-dissolved in water or other solvents [47,58]. This information is also helpful for exploiting new applications of Ti6 for future. Therefore, we first measured the 17O NMR of Ti6C in MeCN to verify the structural integrity of Ti6 in its native solutions. As shown in Fig. 6 , the 17O-enriched Ti6C showed a broad peak of aqua ligands at ca. 17.8 ppm (ν1/2 = 93 ppm) and another two characteristic peaks of μ2 -O at ca. 742.3 ppm (ν1/2 = 0.8 ppm) and 743.4 ppm (ν1/2 = 1.9 ppm), respectively. The ratio of the area of the peaks is in consistent with the three types of oxygen in the solid-state structure of Ti6C, i.e., ca. 20:4:4. Hence, the 17O NMR data suggest that the core structure of Ti6C should remain intact when dissolved in MeCN. SAXS has been widely used in structural characterizations in materials science, and recently used in the analysis of solvated molecular cluster species in solution chemistry of polyoxometalates by Nyman [59,60] and others [61–63]. It is useful in estimation of hydrated radius and distribution of counterions in the peripheral regions of polynuclear clusters. Herein, we also used SAXS to analyze the stability of the polyoxocationic Ti6 clusters in MeCN. It was found that for 20–200 mM Ti6B and Ti6C, the scattering intensity is proportional to concentration, while the radius of gyration does not vary with concentration (see Fig. S4). Both are consistent with the structural integrity of Ti6 clusters in MeCN solutions. According to our previous study [46], in the IR of Ti6B solutions the peaks corresponding to the stretching modes of Ti-Oμ (918 and 821 cm−1) are slightly blue shifted relative to those of the authentic Ti6B, and meanwhile the intensity shows a linear correlation with the concentration (20 – ca. 290 mM). Hence, the solution IR measurements also confirm the stability of Ti6 in MeCN solutions. On the other hand, in the early stage of the photocatalytic oxidation of toluene, the IR of the dried solution shows that the 918 and 821 cm−1 peaks of Ti6B maintained (Fig. S5), indicating the structure of Ti6 remained intact. The reaction solutions remained clear, suggesting formation or involvement of TiO2 nanoparticles during the photocatalytic reactions be ruled out. Hence, Ti6B was the true visible-light photocatalyst for the current selective oxidations. After the complete conversion of BnOH, it was found that PhCOOH and H2O2 were accumulated and indeed cause Ti6 to decompose to some unknown soluble species. Isolation of Ti6B after the photocatalytic reactions for reuse is not possible."
13,Evidences for bonding of Cl– and Br– on Ti6 surfaces,"3.4 Evidences for bonding of Cl– and Br– on Ti6 surfaces Ti6C formed a homogeneous and colorless solution when dissolved in dry MeCN and showed an absorption maximum at ca. 250 nm and an absorption edge at ca. 350 nm (1.7 × 10−5 M; Fig. 7 A). Interestingly, upon additions of Br– (in the form of HBr), the solution became yellowish immediately. The UV–Vis measurements showed that the 250-nm peak of Ti6C shifted to ca. 268 nm, a new peak centered at 400 nm emerged and the absorption edge shifted to ca. 520 nm. Conversely, additions of Cl– to a Ti6B solution caused the blueshift of the absorption onset (Fig. 7B). To verify the spectroscopic change was not brought about by TBA+ cations, we deliberately added TBAC to a Ti6C/MeCN solution and did not observe the spectroscopic change (Fig. 7C). Hence, the changes of both absorbance and absorption edge of Ti6 should be attributed to the reversible association of Br– and Cl– with the Ti6 cluster. We attempted to isolate some crystalline precipitates from the Ti6 solutions with added Br– or Cl–. However, crystallographic data indicated that the resultant crystals were colorless and contained solely the pristine [Ti6O8(OH2)20]8+ clusters. Although this suggests using crystallography to determine the surface structure is still difficult, this also agrees well with the dynamic association of Br– and Cl– with the Ti6 clusters in the solutions. The SAXS data point to the association of Br– and Cl– with the surfaces of Ti6 . First, the radius of gyration of Ti6B is 5.7 nm, larger than that of Ti6C (5.4 nm; Fig. S4). Next, for Ti6C, the probability of pair distance distribution function (PDDF) encounters two maxima located at 5.1 and 11 Å as radius increases (Fig. 8 ), implying it together with the associated Cl– anions forms an ellipsoidal structure in the solution. While Ti6B exhibits similar P(r) function to that of Ti6C, its distribution is slightly wider. The larger hydrodynamic size of Ti6B is consistent with the larger size of Br− than Cl–. XPS was also used to analyze the bonding features in solid Ti6B and Ti6C. Evidence for formation of Ti-Br bond is obtained indirectly by measurement of Ti rather than Br due to the limitation of the XPS technique. The XPS data of two sample were obtained: Ti6B-MeCN powder obtained by rotary evaporation of a yellowish Ti6B/MeCN solution to dryness and Ti6C-MeCN powder obtained in a similar way. The characteristic IR peaks of Ti-Oμ of Ti6B at 918 and 821 cm−1 remained intact after treatment with MeCN solvent, indicating the Ti6O8 core of Ti6B should also remain intact. As shown in Fig. 9 , two types of Ti4+ are observed, since the peak of Ti 2p1/2 of Ti6B is split into two peaks at 464.4 and 463.3 eV, and meanwhile the peak of Ti 2p3/2 is split into two peaks at 458.4 and 458.0 eV, respectively [64–66]. The two types of Ti4+ should be assigned as pristine Ti4+ and Br–-bonded Ti4+, respectively, since no other coordination of Ti4+ is possible. Further, comparing the XPS spectra of Ti6B and that of Ti6C, the binding energies of Ti2p are shifted to the lower energy by 0.2–0.3 eV with Br–. Notably, the 0.2–0.3 eV difference in binding energy could not be attributed to experimental error, but should be caused by the smaller electronegativity of Br than Cl which thereby leads to a higher electronic density of Ti2p in Ti6B [67]. The variation of chemical shift also implies Br– should directly bind to the Ti6O8 core in Ti6B-MeCN sample. Finally, TDDFT was used to calculate the energetics for binding of Br– to Ti6 and to examine the spectroscopic properties of the resultant complexes (Figs. 10 and S6). For this, we assume only one μ 2-O2– or neutral aqua ligand is substituted with a halide anion, accompanied with the addition or removal of one proton to maintain the charge of Ti6 . The zero-point energy and the solvation effects were considered in the calculations. The absorption spectra were calculated based on the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). The TDDFT results show that although substitution of a μ 2-O2– brings about visible light absorption it must cause the fragmentation of Ti6 which is against the structural integrity of brominated Ti6 in MeCN. Thus, we only focused on the substitution of an aqua ligand by a halide ion (Fig. 10 A). Noteworthy that such substitution is energetically favored since the free Gibbs energy decreases by 1.91 eV for the substitution of an α-OH2 and 2.15 eV for the substitution of a β-OH2 (with a Br–; an H+ was added simultaneously). A slightly larger ΔG value suggests β-OH2 is easier for substitution. For the Cl–-substitution, the free Gibbs energy was found to decrease by 1.29 eV for substitution of an α-OH2 and 1.53 eV for substitution of a β-OH2. The DFT calculations also show that the HOMO of Ti6B is localized almost exclusively on the Br– moiety (Fig. 10B; 85–98%), whereas the LUMO and the LUMO + 1 orbitals consist largely of Ti3d orbitals (68–72%). Analogous results were found out in the calculations of the electronic structure of Ti6C (Fig. S6). It has been well-known that even if large computational resources were spent to include as many factors as possible, the calculated absorption edges could still hardly match precisely the experimental values due to the limitations of TDDFT. However, the relative values of the absorption edge of the different TOCs are meaningful when compared with the experimental results. For α-substitution, the calculated HOMO is slightly more positive and the calculated LUMO + 1 is slightly more negative, than those of β-substitution (Fig. 10B). This makes α-substitution more effective in red-shifting of the absorption edge of Ti6B (Fig. 10C). While the potential of the LUMO + 1 of Ti6B and that of Ti6C are quite similar (–4.59 vs –4.56 eV), the potential of the HOMO of Ti6B is more positive than that of Ti6C (–8.62 vs –9.10 eV) due to the smaller electronegativity of Br relative to that of Cl. Whether solvation effect is considered or not, it was found that the absorption edges of all the doped clusters correspond to the transition from HOMO to LUMO + 1 of them. The absorption edge values of the clusters determined by TDDFT are 360, 343, 385 and 426 nm for β-Cl–, α-Cl–, β-Br– and α-Br– – association, respectively (Fig. 10C). Hence, Br–-association brings about much more extensive red-shift of absorption edge than Cl–-association."
14,A brief discussion,"3.5 A brief discussion Previously, doping of TiO2 with halide ions especially F– and Cl– has been investigated extensively [12,68–72]. It has been generally accepted that formation of Ti-F or Ti-Cl bonds in TiO2 NPs does not bring about visible light response, but can enhance performance of the particles in photocatalysis by extending lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers [12,69] or by generating chlorine radicals to initiate chain transfer reactions [70]. Structurally, it was proposed that Cl– was directly anchored at Ti4+ on the surfaces of the particles, consistent with the current study. For Br–-association, studies did demonstrate that it extends the absorption edge of TiO2 to the visible light region [73]. However, the absorption edges of Br–-doped TiO2 rely on the preparation method eventually [65,68,73]. Perhaps the different optical properties of Br–-doped TiO2 from different studies were caused by the nature of Br– in the NPs. In this end, the current study on TOCs may suggest that direct binding of Br– to Ti4+on surfaces of a particle can bring about visible light response to TiO2."
15,Conclusions,"We have developed a Ti-based molecular photocatalyst, Ti6B, to utilize costless sunlight and O2, and selectively oxidize toluenes and benzyl alcohols to the corresponding benzaldehydes. Hence, this system may become a green and cost-effective alternative for the synthesis of benzaldehydes from cheap precursors under mild conditions. Br–-association improves both spectral response and photocatalytic efficiency of a titanium-oxide cluster. Formation of dynamic Ti-Br bond is supported by a set of evidences. Our results not only show the potentials of TOCs in photocatalytic selective oxidations using visible light, but also may be pertinent to understanding the mechanism of doping of TiO2 with non-metal elements."
