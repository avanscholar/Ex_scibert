0,Introduction,"In 2012, the worldwide flights produced 698 million tons of CO2, making aviation fuels responsible for 12% of CO2 emissions from all transport sources [1] with U.S. accounting for 40% of them [2]. In 2010, the world jet fuel consumption was calculated to nearly 5220 barrels per day [3]. Forecasts predict that by 2020 the global aviation emissions will be 70% higher than in 2005 and by 2050 they will further grow by 300–700% [4]. Apart from the significant increase in Greenhouse Gas emissions, other factors like high dependency of aviation fuels on fossil fuels and great uncertainty on oil prices have turned the attention on alternative sources of aviation fuels. Only 2% of global transportation fuels are based on biofuels derived from biomass [5], and these are commonly drop-in fuels i.e. that can be used in blends with existing fossil based fuels. It is reported [6] that in 2012, the most energy consumptive sector was the transportation sector, demanding 27 quadrillion BTU of energy. EIA’s report forecasts, for 2040, a world production of liquid fuels from biomass up to 2.5Mbpd (million barrels per day). In addition to this, by the year 2050, it is forecasted that biofuels will contribute to bringing down the dependency of the transportation sector on oil products to 29% [7]. Asia being the world’s largest carbon dioxide emitter, has already turned its attention to the production and development of biofuels for both environmental and reducing fuel dependency reasons [8]. A worldwide research and development effort is underway to include more biofuels in the air transport [9]. The two main types of aviation fuels are gasoline (avgas) and jet fuel (kerosene) (C8C16) [10]. They are composed mainly of paraffins and cycloparaffins and smaller amounts of aromatics and olefins along with some additives specified by each category of aviation fuel [11]. Due to the special conditions during flight there are strict guidelines for the aviation fuel properties concerning its melting point, viscosity, non freezing or cloudiness phenomena at low temperatures, etc. [12]. At atmospheric conditions both gasoline and kerosene are in liquid form. Owed to the lower carbon chain number in gasoline mixtures, it is more volatile than jet fuel (boiling points: 40–200°C and 150–300°C respectively). The characteristics of each aviation fuel type are strictly specified due to the extreme conditions under which combustion takes place. Avgas is used in internal combustion engines that can operate up to a limited altitude ceiling (<6000m) and therefore is used in reciprocating engines like small aircrafts and light helicopters. This constraint has led to the predominance of jet engines in the air transport sector (more than 98% of the total aviation fuel consumed is jet fuel [13]). Concerning jet fuels, there is a greater variety in categories which are separated based on the military (e.g. JP4 and JP8) and commercial (e.g., Jet A1 and Jet B) use, since each service has its own operational requirements. The main conventional method for aviation fuels production is through refining of crude oil. The main processes of upgrading crude oil to fuels are fractional distillation, hydrotreating and hydrocracking. Refining may include one or a mix of these processes depending on the specifications needed for the aviation fuel. Another method is through Fischer Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) where the feedstock (coal, natural gas or biomass) is firstly converted into a H2/CO gas mixture (syngas) via gasification, following by the hydrocarbons synthesis mainly of long chain paraffins, olefins, alcohols and aldehydes. Depending on the catalyst used, the operating temperature and pressure of the FTS reaction and the H2/CO ratio of syngas, the carbon number of the fuel product can be oriented, thus meeting the requirements for aviation fuels [14]. However, FTS process using as feedstock coal or gas (Coal-to-Liquids, Gas-to Liquids concepts) has some drawbacks: Apart from the high cost of the process and the uncertainty on gas prices, there is an issue about CO2 emissions as they are higher than refining crude oil [15]. Biomass, being a renewable source, offers the potential production of alternative fuels that have a smaller CO2 emissions footprint compared with the fossil based fuels. This is the main drive that attracts policies and correspondingly industries to do business in this sector [16]. Yet, not only need the biomass derived fuels for the aviation sector to have the same specification with the conventional jet fuel types, but they also should be compatible with the typical jet fuel engines because of the aircrafts long lifetime [14]. Chuck and Donnelly [17] have examined the compatibility of several bio-derived fuels with Jet fuel and their potential for blending with the conventional aviation fuel. Currently, there are companies that have adopted the FT process. Sasol, a South African company, produces and distributes aviation fuel, made from coal via Fischer Tropsch [18]. Another company, Syntroleum, produce jet fuel from FT process using natural gas as feedstock [19]. Both companies have turned their attention to producing jet fuel derived from biomass. U.S. Air Force (USAF), which is the leading user of aviation fuels worldwide, has embraced these methods and started co-operating with these companies by using a 50:50 blend of synthetic fuel and conventional kerosene [15,20]. Along with the biomass derived fuels trend, another method for producing aviation fuels is conducted by Gevo [21]. During that process, biomass feedstock is firstly fermented to iso-butanol followed by dehydration to olefins, oligomerization and hydrogenation, resulting to iso-paraffinic kerosene, a blendstock for jet fuel with C12C16 hydrocarbons. This final product can be blended up to 50:50 ratio with petroleum-derived jet fuel and has a low freezing point (−80°C) suitable for aviation use. Last but not least, Byogy Renewables Inc. [22] currently produces jet fuel from biochemically-derived ethanol. Ethanol after being dehydrated, it is converted into long chain hydrocarbons via catalytic synthesis that are continuously fractionated into jet fuel and gasoline. Apart from ethanol, Byogy’s technology can effectively process either propanol or butanol. The produced jet fuel can be used even as a fully substitute for oil-derived jet fuel or used at any blend ratio with conventional jet fuel [23]. In this study, the techno-economic evaluation of various thermochemical pathways for branched paraffins production from biomass that are aimed at aviation fuel substitution is performed. Unlike the majority of similar assessments, this study pays attention to the fuel upgrading section, resulting to the desired final product (here, the long chain hydrocarbons as aviation fuel substitution). Among the under investigation cases, the conventional FTS route as well as novel thermochemical routes through Mixed Alcohol Synthesis (MAS) are involved. According to the latter, branched paraffins that can be used as kerosene substitute, are formed from butanol isomers after certain fuel upgrading procedure. The fuel upgrading methodology after mixed alcohol synthesis depends on the catalyst that is used, since different butanol isomers are formed (see next section). The main economic parameters that are related to the total capital and operational investment are estimated based on data provided from process simulation of the examined cases and on the literature for the cost estimation of each component. Besides, the biochemical options for bio-butanol production through bio-ethanol and the Acetone–Butanol–Ethanol process (ABE) are also investigated and evaluated in comparison with the corresponding thermochemical options."
1,Biomass-to-jet fuel potential pathways,"In order to convert biomass into aviation fuels, there are numerous pathways and processes to do so. In Fig. 1 , some of these pathways are indicated. There are several engineering research efforts on the development of alternative pathways to avionic jet fuel components [14] such as the production of lower alcohols (C1C3) as block chemicals derived from thermochemistry [24–27] or fermentation [28–31], followed by increasing the alcohols’ carbon chain length by means of Guerbet reactions [32] or by dehydration to olefins that then undergo oligomerization [33]. For instance, in Gevo’s technology isobutanol is used as block chemical [21], whereas in Byogy process, ethanol is the basis for long chain paraffins production [23]. In both cases, the (valuable) intermediate chemicals that are produced (olefins, higher alcohols and paraffins) along the processes can be retrieved, purified and considered as final products. Another, more direct, approach is the pyrolysis and upgrading of the pyrolytic oil (bio-oil) [34–36] which still requires basic development and will not be examined in this work. In addition, biofuels can also be produced from algae [37,38], from animal residue [39] or from CO2 with water and solar energy (Solar to petrol-S2P) [40]. Continuously, jet fuel can be also produced by catalytic conversion of biomass hydrolysate in aqueous phase [41]. Furthermore, there are even more routes that can lead to branched paraffins though they are not adopted because of high cost levels, and lack of technological establishment. One of the important block alcohols mentioned before is butanol. As a biofuel for internal combustion engines, it has the potential to replace ethanol [5,42]. Although it blends well with gasoline it cannot be successfully mixed in jet fuel without further upgrading to compounds with longer carbon chains. The carbon atoms structure in the butanol molecule can be either linear (1- and 2-butanol) or branched (tert-and iso-butanol), the properties of which such as boiling temperature and melting point are different. Consequently, the corresponding olefins that are produced via alcohol dehydration differ from each other. In this study, the aviation fuel (jet fuel and gasoline) production by means of syngas toward mixed alcohol synthesis is examined. The alcohols mixture, by gas phase Guerbet, leads to the C4 block alcohols that undergo dehydration toward C4 olefins, which through oligomerization and hydrogenation are transformed to desired branched paraffins that can blend well with fossil derived jet fuels. One of the purposes of this paper is the techno-economic evaluation of converting biomass to aviation fuels according to five process options/pathways, which are enclosed in frameworks with dotted line in Fig. 1. Two of the three thermochemical pathways to aviation fuels are thoroughly investigated in terms of performance and cost analysis and are compared with the third thermochemical option, the FTS route, and with two cases on biochemical pathway. In the case of thermochemical routes, a detailed costing methodology is presented, taking into account all the process steps that are involved in syngas production and conditioning, fuel synthesis and upgrading. On the other hand, in the biochemical pathways, the economic data for the part of the plant that is related with the alcohols synthesis (ethanol and butanol) was obtained from the literature and only the equipment costs in the fuel upgrading unit (alcohol to jet fuel) were calculated in detail. This study focuses on comparing different value chains employing different technologies for the production of renewable bio based fuels for airborne applications starting from appropriate feedstocks for each technological route. Fig. 2 presents schematically the process steps for the liquid aviation fuel production from biomass based on Alcohols to Jet fuel (ATJ) concept. The complex organic structures of lignocellulosic biomass are thermally transformed into simple compounds by mean of gasification. After a multi-step procedure, the syngas composed of CO and H2 is used for synthesis of a mixture of light alcohols [24,43]. The aviation fuels can be produced from these alcohols after they have been upgraded. The organic compounds that do not participate in the branched paraffins synthesis have to be reformed back into syngas and their carbon atoms to be reused. Part of the recirculating light gas (tail gas) is utilized in a Cogeneration Heat and Power (CHP) in order to meet steam, heat and power requirements of the overall process, making it self-sustainable. The majority of the analyses of such biorefinery concepts are examined for large scale applications with feedstock thermal input ranging from 150 to 500MWth [44–50]. According to the NREL study, the product cost ($/kg) sharply increases for small plant capacities [51]. Furthermore, a typical value for the capital cost scaling factor of a biorefinery has been estimated at 0.7 [52], implying the advantage of plants with larger capacity in terms of economic feasibility against the smaller ones. On the other hand, for higher capacities, issues like biomass availability and logistics costs emerge and therefore biorefinery concepts with larger scale are avoided for investigation. In this light and, in order the results to be easily compared to the corresponding studies in the literature, the selected feedstock thermal input of the examined plant is 190MWth."
2,Syngas production from lignocellulosic biomass,"2.1 Syngas production from lignocellulosic biomass The biomass source assumed in this work is wood that can be easily gasified to produce syngas. This part of the bio-refinery process has already been described in previous study [24]. Fig. 2. depicts the process steps for syngas production at the pressurized oxy-blown gasifier, the gas cleaning including the NH3, HCl, H2S and CO2 and the syngas conditioning in the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reactor, so that to meet the desired H2/CO ratio at the synthesis unit. This assessment study does not discuss at length the selection of each technology/method for syngas production, gas cleaning and conditioning but to present two novel AJF concepts and to compare each other and with FTS route and biochemical pathways. For that reason, this part of the thermochemical systems is common. The selection of the Rectisol process among the others options (Selexol, amines) was based on the following advantages (a) high selectivity toward sour components, which results to an acid stream with high purity, (b) commercially available in large scale (>100MW) applications by Lurgi and (c) comparing to chemical AGR methods, such as amine, Rectisol is more suitable for CO2 removal with high partial pressures [53]. The rate of S removal from syngas is determined by the specifications of the catalysts employed for fuel synthesis. The H2S removal requirement for MAS reactor catalysts is 1ppmv [54,55]. The same specification for H2S removal is also adopted in the FTS analysis. As far as the CO2 separation from the syngas is concerned, this has multiple beneficial effects since it does not take part in the fuel synthesis: (a) increase of H2 and CO partial pressure, which enhances the conversion rate, (b) decrease of syngas compression duty and (c) reduction of the size of the Fuel Synthesis Unit. The typical CO2 removal rate that is specified in the vast majority of the similar thermochemical cases is 90%, and is adopted in this study, too.”"
3,Mixed alcohols synthesis and fuel upgrading,"2.2 Mixed alcohols synthesis and fuel upgrading A general scheme of the proposed process for paraffins production from syngas, through mixed alcohols upgrading, is shown in Fig. 2. The clean syngas (6) is separated from CO2 (7). The CO2 removal technology that is adopted in this study is the Rectisol™ process, the ASPENPlus™ modeling of which has been also described in previous studies [24,56]. The outlet streams from the Mixed Alcohol Synthesis (MAS) reactor and separation Unit are: the light gases that consist of the unconverted syngas, some CO2 and light hydrocarbons and the produced higher alcohols (9). Part of the light gases stream (15) undergoes autothermal reforming (ATR) with the addition of water steam (16) and oxygen (17) in order to convert the hydrocarbons into CO and H2. The reformate product is then recompressed and mixed with the original inlet syngas. Another part of the light gases is diverted to the Pressure Swing Adsorption process (PSA) for the production of pure H2 (14) which is required for the branched paraffins production. The rest of the stream and the tail gas of the PSA process consists the fuel gas (13) that is sent to a GT combustor and used in a combined cycle for heat and power production to cover the energy requirements of the integrated plant. The produced alcohols (9) undergo a condensation reaction to enhance C4+ alcohols (10) followed by dehydration, in order to be transformed into the corresponding light olefins (11). The increment of carbon chain is performed in the next process step where the C4 oligomers synthesis (12) takes place. Finally, via hydrogenation process, branched paraffins are produced, which are essential for the jet fuel (18) and avgas (19) blending. 2.2.1 Mixed alcohols synthesis The synthesis of mixed alcohol is conducted under high pressure (>40bar) and at temperature 250–320°C in presence of catalyst that favors the reactions of alcohol synthesis: (R1) n CO + 2 n H 2 → C n H 2 n + 1 OH + ( n - 1 ) H 2 O Apart from this reaction, water gas shift reaction and alkane synthesis reactions also take place due to the formation of H2O from the alcohols synthesis reactions: (R2) CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2 The higher alcohol synthesis mechanism involves a complex set of reactions leading to a mixture of products, the composition of which is determined by kinetic and thermodynamic constraints, the process conditions and catalyst type. The most abundant products are low carbon chain alcohols (C2 C4), methanol, hydrocarbons and CO2. There are several types of mixed alcohol catalysts with a great variety on alloy composition and the promoters [57] which are classified into two main categories, modified Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (Fe, Ni, Co, Mo, Rh based) and modified Methanol synthesis (K, Zn, Cr, Cu based) catalysts [58]. In the framework of this study, two catalysts from each group are selected from the literature and are investigated. Needless to say, they have perform differently as far as CO conversion and alcohol selectivity affecting the overall process configuration. The procedure for branched paraffins formation is strongly depended on the mixed alcohols composition after the synthesis reactor. The process pathways from the two under investigation cases are described in detail below. 2.2.2 Alcohols condensation (Guerbet reactions) The main alcohol product from a MAS reactor with modified FT catalyst is ethanol, taking also in account the fact that the produced methanol reenters the reactor for the formation of higher alcohols. The first step of fuel upgrading is the ethanol condensation for higher alcohols formation. In this case, catalysts that promote the ethanol condensation for butanol synthesis should be used [59]. Typical catalysts that enhance ethanol upgrading to butanol are alkali earth metal oxides and modified MgO [60]. Dowson et al. [61] observed very good ethanol conversion and high n-butanol selectivity by using RuCl2 catalyst. (R3) 2 C 2 H 5 OH → C 4 H 9 OH + H 2 O In case of modified methanol catalyst implementation, the produced methanol is reacted with ethanol and propanol giving isobutanol [62,63] in Pd or Cu based catalyst in the presence of sodium methoxide (CH3ONa) as base [64]. To model it, basing on the experimental results of Carlini et al. [62] the following reactions are assumed to take place consecutively: (R4) CH 3 OH + C 2 H 5 OH → C 3 H 7 OH + H 2 O (R5) CH 3 OH + C 3 H 7 OH → C 4 H 9 OH + H 2 O 2.2.3 Alcohols dehydration In alcohols dehydration, oxygen is removed in the form of H2O, forming a double bond between the carbons that are connected with the OH− and H+ that are removed: (R6) C 3 H 7 OH → C 3 H 6 + H 2 O (R7) C 4 H 9 OH → C 4 H 8 + H 2 O Several relevant studies have proved that catalysts such alumina, Ru, Amberlyst acidic resins and ZSM-5 zeolites have an efficient effect on alcohols dehydration under high pressure [65]. Makarova et al. [66] suggested a two step mechanics for n-butanol dehydration; the reaction proceeds via fast ether formation (dibutyl ether – C8H18O) and subsequent slower decomposition of ether. From this perspective, higher temperatures are required in order to get high olefin selectivity. The same conclusion is drawn from the study of Lee et al. [67], where dehydration is dominant over the ether formation (alcohol dehydrogenation) at T >250°C. Concerning the products selectivity, from the same study it is concluded that the butene product is depended on the butanol isomer that undergoes dehydration. 2.2.4 Olefins oligomerization In this step, the increase of carbon atoms chain number is performed: (R8) n C 4 H 8 → C 4 n H 8 n , n = 2 , 3 , 4 The way that is chosen, is the combination of unsaturated molecules (i.e. alkenes) to the formation of the corresponding oligomers (dimmers, trimers and even, tetramers). The reaction takes place in liquid phase, inside stirred reactors, in presence of special catalyst that promotes oligomers formation against other reactions such as cracking, dehydrogenation, and polymerization. Ethylene is the most commonly used light olefin for oligomerization and polymerization as it is illustrated by the numerous relevant studies and by the industrial interest in polyethylene plastic material, owed to the several industrial applications that it has. However, high selectivity on C2 C8 oligomers against C10+ oligomers [68–70] makes this route inappropriate for high production rates of hydrocarbons required for jet fuel blends. n-Butene attracts the interest of many studies for further upgrading such as oligomerization, mainly on the grounds that this C4 isomer mainly is derived from biochemical processes through fermentation. Recently, Coelho et al. [71] investigated the influence of process parameters in 1-butene oligomerization with HZSM-5 revealing the existence of secondary reactions such as cracking after a certain temperature increase (200°C) that deteriorate the oligomers selectivity (mainly C8). High pressure and short contact time favor the heavier products formation. The coke formation observed in a wide temperature range contributed to catalyst deactivation by either poisoning the acid sites or by blocking the pores. Simultaneous complete n-butene conversions with high selectivity on C8 and C12+ oligomers are noted in Kolombos’ patent [33] where gallium catalyst is used. Very promising results are remarked in the study of Lavrenov and Duplyakin [72] where over 85% conversion and 90% selectivity is observed after an oligomerization of butene mixture over borate-Containing alumina catalyst at 150°C/80bar. One of the most promising yields of 1-butene oligomerization, revealing highly efficient batch catalytic methodology is the recent invention of Wright et al. [12] using Cp2ZrCl2 dissolved in methylaluminoxane (MAO) solution. Similarly, isobutene oligomerization has been extensively studied not only for oligomers production purposes but as a separation method of isobutene from n-butenes in a C4 refinery cut [73]. Amberlyst-15, a cationic ion-exchange resin, is frequently used as the catalytic medium for isobutene oligomerization thank to its very good performance related to high conversion rates (over 90%) and very good selectivity on dimmers (diisobutylene), trimers (triisobutylene) and tetramers (tetraisobutylene) [73–75]. Alternatively, zeolites are also implemented presenting very good performance [76] but rapid deactivation has been observed [75,77]. 2.2.5 Oligomers hydrogenation In order to produce an organic mixture that will be treated as transportation fuel, the alkenes transformation into paraffins (alkanes) with the addition of H2 is required. Several studies have reported the effective accomplishment of these reactions type in the presence of Pd alloys catalysts [78,79] in relative high pressure (>20bar), at 200–350°C [80].

4,Process modeling,"The process modeling and simulation is performed with ASPENPlus™. Based on generally approved methodologies and on data extracted from experimental studies in small scale or patents, the model of a large scale biorefinery plant with 190MWth thermal capacity is developed, enabling the effective calculation of the mass and energy balance in each unit and the whole process, too. The selection of the suitable property method is of high importance and depends on the type of process and the kind of streams (phase, composition) that take place in each case. For the part of syngas production and conditioning, the RK-SOAVE property method is selected, whereas for the fuel synthesis and upgrading part the NRTL [24]. In the last part, the main factor that determines the most suitable property method is the accurate vapor–liquid equilibrium calculation especially for the effective separation and upgrading of the produced hydrocarbons. Two main case studies are examined in detail. In the first one (case 1), the alcohol synthesis is performed with modified FT (MAS modFT) catalyst while in the second one (case 2), the catalyst used is modified Methanol (MAS modMeOH). In both cases, the syngas comes from woody biomass gasification in oxygen blown pressurized gasifier, followed by the same gas cleaning and conditioning methodology. The bio-refinery part that relates with the syngas production, cleaning and conditioning is common for both cases. A detailed description of model setup for this section can be found in previous study [56]. The method that is chosen for the acid gases removal is the Rectisol™ process for both H2S and CO2. In Table 1 , the basic key parameters for the process modeling related to syngas production, gas cleaning, the ASU, the Autothermal Reformer and the Power Island are summarized. As far as the alcohol synthesis is concerned, the process parameters and the MAS reactor performance are summarized in Table 2 . The catalyst from the study of Aden et al. [81], as referenced in the work of Zhu et al. [82], is the modified FT catalyst. More detailed description of the catalyst performance and the methodology for yields calculation can be found in the study of Zhu et al. [82]. In this analysis, the carbon selectivity and conversion rate from the methanol reaction in the reactor is examined. As a result, it was possible to obtain useful data for modeling the methanol re-circulation, after it is recovered from the rest alcohols. These catalyst types promote the formation of higher alcohols, mainly ethanol. On the other hand, the modified methanol catalysts (Fe–Cu, Cu–Zn base) result to high selectivity in methanol [43,83,84] regardless the promotions employed."
5,Paraffins from mixed alcohols with modified FT (case 1),"3.1 Paraffins from mixed alcohols with modified FT (case 1) The process flowsheet of the fuel upgrading in this case, including the reactors, separators (columns, flash separators and decanters), heat exchangers and stream recirculation, is presented in Fig. 3 . After the alcohols synthesis and separation of the light gases, ethanol product is isolated and sent for condensation. The recovered methanol is recycled and resent to the MAR, whilst the higher alcohols are mixed with produced n-butanol. The ethanol self-condensation approach is based on the experimental findings from the study of Dowson et al. [61]. For the set of the specifications of the dehydration process it is securely assumed that all the alcohols are totally converted into the corresponding alkenes [86,87]. The higher alcohols separation in this stage is necessary in order to avoid accumulation at the next stage (i.e. Guerbet Reaction unit) during ethanol recirculation. For the same reason, water produced from the Guerbet reaction is removed by means of a water decanter. The Guerbet reactor and the Dehydration reactor, since both the reactants and the products are in gaseous phase, resemble to the MAR; they are considered as plug flow reactors filled with catalyst (fixed bed). On the other hand, the Oligomerization and the Hydrogenation reactors are regarded as continuous stirred reactors and the catalysts are diluted in the liquid phase. Since the latter reactors have batch operation, the number of batch reactors for each case is determined by the residence time of each reaction. The hydrogen from the hydrogenation process is recovered from the unconverted syngas by means of the Pressure Adsorption Process (PSA). The required flow rate of hydrogen is equal to the amount of olefins that should be hydrogenated. The hydrogen concentration in the inlet stream at the PSA must be at least 70% v/v. Hence, a recycle is incorporated to meet the minimum H2 concentration level. The continuous operation of the PSA process is secured by the usage of two separate beds, where adsorption and desorption take place alternately [88,89]. The hydrogenation reaction is assumed to take place in 30bar and 250°C. Experiments in pressure >20bar showed very high olefins conversion rates (>90%) and very good alkanes selectivity (near to 100%) [80,90]."
6,Paraffins from mixed alcohols with modified methanol (case 2),"3.2 Paraffins from mixed alcohols with modified methanol (case 2) This concept has strong similarities to the Gevo’s process for jet fuel production [91] based on isobutanol [90]. The fuel upgrading process flowsheet of this case, including all the main components such as reactors, separators, and heat exchangers. is presented in Fig. 4 . After the mixed alcohols synthesis and the light gas separation, the liquid alcohol mixture undergoes condensation for isobutanol transformation. After the condensation reactor, two consequent columns follow for methanol/isobutanol/C2–3OH separation. The unreacted C2–3 alcohols return to the reactor whereas the recovered methanol is sent for reforming. The ethanol conversion by (R4) is assumed equal to 71.2%, while the propanol conversion at (R5) is set 82.0%, including the amount of propanol produced by the (R4). These conversion rates were adopted by Carlini et al. [62]. According to Carlini et al. [62,63] the selectivity to butanol was about 100%, so no other by-products are considered in this case. Afterwards, the isobutanol undergoes dehydration for the corresponding alkene formation (isobutene), in presence of alumina. From [65] it is confirmed that high isobutylene conversion and high selectivity to isobutylene can be achieved with no significant impurity effects. The carbon chain growth is performed in the next reactor where olefins oligomerization takes place. The produces dimers, trimers and tetramers are converted into branched paraffins by means of hydrogenation. Table 3 . summarizes the process specifications and assumptions that are considered on the present process modeling for both cases. The catalyst type is not taken into account on the ASPENPlus™ modeling but it is quoted for reasons of completeness. Adopting the experience from NREL’s group previous analyses [92,93], all the distillation columns are assumed to have 70 stages with a pressure drop equal to 0.5bar and separation efficiency up to 99%. The reactors in the fuel synthesis and upgrading unit are modeled with stoichiometric reactors, the conversion rate of each reaction is determined by the selectivity yield and the reactants conversion rate (Table 3). The successful performance of the two final process steps (oligomerization and hydrogenation) is decisive for the correct final product formulation. There exist patents describing these two final steps for both cases [12,90] assuring the compatibility of the produced paraffins to jet fuel through the verification of the physical properties via certain standards. Hence, the use of the produced branched paraffins from the proposed concepts as fuel blends in jet engines can be considered valid."
7,Cost analysis methodology,"After having determined the processes and operational data for each examined case, a cost analysis for a “next” plant is performed in order to evaluate the economical feasibility of each case. Thus, the Capex and Opex for each case are estimated. The methodology for the Total Capital Investment (TCI) is based on a series of intermediate cost types, the first of which is the Total Purchased Equipment cost (TPEC) for each case. The cost of each equipment is estimated either based on similar equipment costs from the literature or based on Peters and Timmerhaus [94] methodologies. In the first case, the similar equipment costs obtained from the literature are scaled up to this study’s operational data and streams, according to the six-tenths factor rule: (1) Cost of equipment new = ( cost of equipment reference ) ∗ ( X ) f where X is the ratio of the capacity of the new equipment to the capacity of the reference equipment, raised to a scaling factor f given from reference. For some novel equipment that is not found in the literature, such as the dehydration and condensation reactors, a rough economical assumption is adopted. Since the reactants/products are apparent in those plug-flow reactors in gaseous form, the design configuration of them are considered to be similar with the mixed alcohol synthesis reactors. Thus, the cost methodology for these reactors is the same to a MAS reactor [82]. Furthermore, having the Total Purchased Equipment Cost (TPEC) estimated, the next step is the Total Installed Cost (TIC) calculation. This is accomplished by multiplying each equipment cost with an installation factor, specified for each component (see Supplementary Data). The methodology followed for the estimation of TCI is summarized in Table 4 . Apart from the TCI calculation of each case, the estimation of the respective Operating Costs is also performed. The Operating Costs consist of Fixed and Variable Operating Costs. Fixed Costs include Maintenance Costs, Insurance and Taxes, as well as General Overhead Costs. The parameters that are used for the calculation of these costs are shown in Table 5 . Regarding the Variable Operating Costs, the majority of them are determined according to the stream flows derived from process simulations. Variable Operating Costs include salaries, feedstock costs, main catalyst and solvents costs and waste disposal costs, calculated in an annual basis. Both fixed operational costs and salaries are divided by the number of areas and are distributed depending on the number of process steps of each area. The salaries are calculated based on the number of process steps in each case, by estimating the amount of employee hours needed according to Peters and Timmerhaus [94] and multiplying them with the average employee hour cost found in Eurostat [95]. Feedstock price is considered as 60€/dry metric ton. Catalysts replacement is assumed to take place every 2 or 3years, depending on the catalyst type. The Variable Operating Costs Assumptions are described in Table 5. Having the Total Capital Investment, the Fixed and Variable Operating Costs for each case determined, the Discounted Cash Flow Rate of Return (DCFROR) analysis is performed. Through this analysis, the economical viability of each case is examined for a 25-years operational plant life. According to this, the Present Value (PV) per unit volume of aviation fuel at a net present value of zero and a 10% internal rate of return is calculated. This value reflects the Minimum Fuel Selling Price (MFSP) that sets the boundaries for the investment feasibility. The main economic assumptions are described in Table 6 . The depreciation model used on the current paper is Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) method through a Double-Declining-Balance (DDB) with a recovery time of 7years with zero salvage value for the plant at the end of its lifetime. The plant is considered to be electrically independent, thus, there is no purchasing or selling electricity."
8,Results and discussion,"In this section, the results of the current paper are presented. They are separated in two main parts. The results derived from the process modeling of the cases (stream tables, energy and mass balances, etc.) and the results extracted from the economic evaluation of such concepts (Capex, Opex, MJFSP, etc.). The comparison of the produced aviation fuel with the typical jet A1 in terms of properties is illustrated in Table 7 . It is clear that in both thermochemical cases the properties of the produced aviation fuels are very close to the typical characteristics of the standard fuel."
9,Mass and energy balance calculations,"5.1 Mass and energy balance calculations The basic results from the process analysis are summarized in Table 8 . Apart from the specific productivity, another index for the plant performance determination is that of thermal efficiency. It evaluates the amount of the initial biomass feedstock heat input that remains at the final fuel product and is defined as in (Eq. (2)): (2) η th = m Jet Fuel · LHV Jet Fuel m wood · LHV wood The main results reveal a quite good biomass-to-aviation fuel conversion through the thermochemical route. Case 2, which is based on modMeOH for MAS, has a slightly better performance than case 1. This is mainly attributed to the higher MAS operation pressure in case 1 that leads to higher power consumptions for gas compression and better utilization of the produced alcohols mixture in case 2. It is pointed out that it should not be generalized that the methodology based on the modMeOH catalyst always leads to higher efficiency, compared to the modFT approach. The corresponding results from the FT case are discussed in following section. The thermodynamic characteristics of the most important streams of the biorefinery, for both thermochemical routes, are summarized in Table 9a and 9b . Figs. 5a and 5b shows the energy flow along the process via the Sankey diagram. Three forms of energy are observed: chemical, heat and work power. The significance of MAS specifications (CO conversion and selectivity to alcohols) is illustrated by the large amount of recycling gas that is almost 1 and a half times greater than the total fuel heat input. Also, one fourth of the total energy content of the biomass feedstock is transformed into heat during gasification and syngas conditioning, before the mixed alcohol synthesis. At it is seen, only a part of this heat can be recovered and utilized for steam generation in the GTCC unit. In both cases, up to 50% of the fuel heating value is transformed into heat and rejected to the environment from various processes. A large amount of low enthalpy heat is released from the system in the cooling tower due to steam condensation and during syngas inter-cooling after the ATR. Part of the dissipated heat throughout the process, especially in the MAS Unit, is utilized for steam integration within the Power Plant. The very low quality segments of the rest of the dissipated heat are not usable and only represent cooling loads. Several interesting conclusions can be extracted from the carbon balance analysis for each case. The fuel yields are strongly correlated with the fate of C atoms along the process; unlike H and O atoms that are partially derived from water, the C for fuel synthesis is exclusively derived from the feedstock biomass. Another aspect is that since CO2 is of the most stable compounds, any carbon formation to carbon dioxide cannot longer be utilized. Through the thermochemical options, as it is seen in Figs. 6a and 6b , around 50% of the total carbon is transformed into CO2 along the syngas production and conditioning steps. The gasification process contributes by 20% to this, whereas the syngas conditioning (WGS reactor) by 20% and the rest of it comes from the fuel synthesis and from the reforming of the recycling light gases. Also, a part of carbon in the form of CO or other light organic gases is led for combustion to the GT, due to the heat and power requirements coverage. Consequently, about one third of C content is finally utilized for the advanced fuel synthesis through thermochemical routes (see Table 8). The water management in such energy systems is of high importance, since a large amount of water is needed or extracted from various points along the process. It is seen in Fig. 7 that the water treatment unit handles a total water flow equal to 29.1kg/s for water cleaning. The water flow rates for cooling purposes, especially in the Fuel Synthesis Unit and the Fuel Upgrading Unit can be reduced with a more efficient heat recovery from the steam cycle. Since a part of water is released to the atmosphere from the flue gas stack and the cooling tower, 23.7kg/s should be pumped from a natural deposit in order to meet the water balance of the system. In other words, the annual demands for fresh water of this plant with heat capacity ∼190MWth are approximately 641,000m3. This fact should be taken into consideration in terms of the biorefinery impact on the environment in future studies."
10,Investigation of potential CO2 utilization,"5.2 Investigation of potential CO2 utilization It is clear from the carbon balance analysis that a considerable amount of carbon content of the biomass feedstock is not utilized for fuel synthesis and upgrading but is released to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. This fact is the motivation for the investigation of the CO2 capture and utilization (CCU) aspect. According to this, carbon dioxide from the CO2 separation and recovery unit reacts with H2 in the presence of catalyst at high pressures and is converted into CO, methanol and other higher alcohols. The key process assumptions for the CCU modeling are based on the experimental study of Nieskens et al. [101] and are presented in Table 10 . The results from the investigation of the CO2 utilization are summarized in Fig. 8 illustrating the carbon balance for cases with different rate of carbon capture and utilization. As CO2 conversion to CO or other organic compounds is conducted in high pressure, a significant amount of electrical power is required for CO2/H2 mixture compression. In this case, it is inevitable that a larger fraction of the recovered light gases to be sent to the power island (“gas to GT”). Hence, the portion of carbon that results to the final desired product (“final fuel”) is slightly greater in the case of no CCU. This is also illustrated to the corresponding thermal efficiency – 32.5% for 0% CCU, 29.4% for 50% CCU and 27.0% for 100% CCU. Taking also in consideration the fact of additional equipment cost of the CCU (mainly composed of the CO2 compressor and the catalytic reactor), the CO2 utilization with this concept is not adopted. Alternative concepts with different source of hydrogen (e.g. from water electrolysis) or power source (e.g. from RES or the electrical grid) may lead to different conclusions about carbon utilization."
11,Comparison with Fischer–Tropsch synthesis process,"5.3 Comparison with Fischer–Tropsch synthesis process In this section, the comparison with the conventional Fischer–Tropsch synthesis process in thermodynamic point of view is performed and discussed. A general scheme of the fuel synthesis through the Fischer–Tropch synthesis combined with fuel upgrading and separation is shown in Fig. 9 . The syngas stream that comes from the gas cleaning and conditioning unit is mixed with the recirculating unconverted syngas and enters the CO2 removal unit for the last step of syngas conditioning. This process flowsheet is the same as the MAS cases, up to the fuel synthesis step. The Fischer–Tropsch synthesis is conducted at 250°C and at slightly lower pressure levels compared to the gasification (25bar), hence no syngas boosting is required after the Gas Conditioning Unit pressure drop. The FT synthesis modeling was based on an Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) distribution [102] and was performed in ASPENplus™ from a previous work of the authors [103]. In order to maximize the yield of higher alkanes, the H2/CO ratio should be as low as it can. On the other hand, lower H2/CO ratio favors carbon deposition, which shortens the catalyst (Cu-based) lifetime. So the H2/CO ratio is set equal to 1.0. The recovered waxes from the 1st separation stage undergo hydrocracking in order to be converted into lower hydrocarbons. The hydrocracking modeling is simplified in the framework of this work. A typical composition of the products after the hydrocracking process is adopted from the study of Shah et al. [104] i.e. assumed to be 3.46% CH4 (Fuel gas), 8.77% C3 (LPG), 26.10% C8 (Gasoline), and 61.67% C16 (Diesel). Each hydrocarbon represents a certain fuel product. The hydrogen from the hydrocracking process is recovered from the unconverted syngas by means of the Pressure Adsorption Process (PSA). The required flow rate of hydrogen is based on the mass ratio (=0.0103kg/kg) of wax to hydrogen (a figure derived from the study of Sudiro and Bertucco [105]). Comparing the main data yielded for the FTS case with the corresponding data from the MAS routes in Table 8. it is revealed that the MAS pathways have higher jet fuel productivity, since they are designed to have jet fuel as the main biofuel product. The overall thermal efficiency is calculated at 40.4% and the total carbon utilization at 30.4%, slightly lower than the corresponding values in modMeOH case. It is worth mentioning the considerably low power consumptions in this case: This is attributed both to the lower FT reactor operation pressure and to the high CO conversion rate that is assumed, which enables lower recirculating gas flows, contrary to the MAS cases."
12,Economic evaluation,"5.4 Economic evaluation 5.4.1 Thermochemical cases 10kg/s biomass input (or 864t/day) According to the previous methodology and the mentioned economic data that is adopted, the DCFROR analysis resulted to the Minimum Jet Fuel Selling Prices for each case studied: 1.24, 1.49 and 1.28€/l for each of the thermochemical cases: FT, MAS-ModFT and MAS-ModMeOH respectively, with a capacity of 864ton of dry biomass per day. For the FT case, due to the great range of hydrocarbons produced, apart from jet fuel (end-product), other fuel types produced (LPG, Gasoline) are considered as by-products. It is assumed that they are available to buy with the 2011year conventional price: LPG is considered to be sold at 0.29€/l [106] whereas gasoline at 0.56€/l [107]. Similarly, gasoline is considered as by-product for the other two thermochemical cases. Fig. 10 shows the contribution of CAPEX, OPEX, Biomass Feedstock Cost and By-product Credits (gasoline in all cases whereas LPG only for FT case) to the production cost of jet fuel in €/l. The costs are also expressed in €/GJ of jet fuel’s High Heating Value – HHV (46.2MJ/kg) for a plant’s Capacity of 190MWth. For the calculations, it was assumed a jet fuel density equal to 0.81kg/l. The considerable effect of Capex on the Jet fuel production cost is illustrated in Fig. 10, since it has the largest share to the product cost for all thermochemical cases. In addition, the cost of biomass feedstock participates in a significant portion to the cost of final product. FT Synthesis case seems to be a more economically feasible scenario. This is attributed to two main reasons: firstly, the capital investment cost of the alcohol based routes is higher, due to the complexity of fuel upgrading unit. Secondly, more by-products than the other two cases are produced in the FT case, which are considered to be sold according to current’s market prices. Moreover, the total capital investment cost for each thermochemical case is described in Fig. 11 . The Mod-FT case has the highest TCI with 248M€ whereas the lowest one is observed at the FT case with 207M€. Fig. 11 also illustrates the breakdown of the installation cost of each case, showing the installed cost of each area of processes, too. Thus, a conclusion on the share that holds each area of processes in each case can be derived. The most expensive process unit is the Syngas Cleaning and Conditioning Area for all three cases. For FT case, this area has the highest share to the Total Installation cost with 23.85% of the TIC of the plant. Respectively, for the Mod-FT and Mod-MeOH cases, the values are 24.34% and 28.52%. Moreover, the Air Separation Unit and Power Plant contribute greatly to the TIC of each case. In summary, Mod-FT case has the highest Installation Costs of equipment with 131M€, with Mod-MeOH case having 128M€ and FT case having the lowest Installation costs, near 109M€. The fact that Mod-FT case has greater equipment/installation cost than the Mod-MeOH is attributed to the higher power consumption in the former case, as it is illustrated by the greater share of power island on total equipment cost. The other components of TCI are calculated as mentioned previously and depend on Installation and Purchased Equipment costs. As Syngas Cleaning and Conditioning Area has the most expensive processes, in Fig. 12 , a breakdown to its equipment is shown along with the share they have in the total installation cost of the area. Both in FT and Mod-MeOH cases, the most expensive equipment belong to ATR with a contribution of 16% and 32% in each case whereas in Mod-FT case it is the second most expensive process with 19%. This is due to the fact that large streams are sent to the ATR to be reformed. In Mod-FT case, the most expensive process is the Rectisol unit used for CO2 removal with 21%, whereas in FT and Mod-MeOH cases, the contribution of Rectisol units is 15% and 21% respectively. Another costly process is that of tar reformer that contributes 18%, 14% and 13% of the total installation cost of Cleaning and Conditioning Area in FT, Mod-FT and Mod-MeOH cases respectively. In addition, the breakdown of OPEX for each case is described in Fig. 13 . The feedstock cost has the greatest contribution to the total amount of OPEX being nearly 45% of the total OPEX in each case. Mod-FT and Mod-MeOH cases have about the same OPEX, with Mod-MeOH case having higher catalyst costs, needed for the upgrading of higher alcohols to aviation fuels. Fig. 14 presents the breakdown of CAPEX and OPEX (without biomass feedstock) to the process areas, expressed in € per liter Jet Fuel. Fixed Operational Costs include General Overhead, Insurance and Taxes and Maintenance Costs. In the FT pathway, the most expensive units, concerning both CAPEX and OPEX, are the Syngas Cleaning and Conditioning, ASU, Fuel Upgrading and Utilities. Utilities part includes the Waste Water Treatment Unit and Cooling System of the biorefinery along with the variable costs of treating and disposing the wastes and process water. In the Mod-FT case, the most expensive areas are Syngas Cleaning and Conditioning, Power Plant, ASU, Fuel Upgrading and the Utilities section. In Mod-MeOH case, similarly with Mod-FT case, the most expensive areas are Syngas Cleaning and Conditioning, ASU, Power Plant, Fuel Upgrading, Utilities whereas Fuel Synthesis has a significant impact on the production cost of jet fuel. In comparison with the Mod-FT case, the Opex of fuel upgrading is higher. This is due to the fact that in Mod-MeOH case, the catalyst used is more expensive and the amount of catalysts needed is higher. In addition, the CAPEX of Power Plant is significantly lower (from 21M€ down to 18M€), due to lower power consumptions in this case. 5.4.2 Effect of plant capacity Apart from the thermochemical pathways of converting biomass to biofuels, another important route is that of biochemical. Due to the fact that the three thermochemical Pathways described on the current paper have a capacity of 864t/day biomass feedstock, a direct comparison with the biochemical Pathways with capacity of 2000t/day is not convenient. Thus, via ASPENPlus™ [108], the thermochemical case Mod-MeOH was modeled for 2000t/day biomass feedstock. The economical analysis was conducted as described previously in order to calculate the Minimum Jet Fuel Selling Price. The calculation methods for equipment costs, CAPEX, OPEX are the same with the lower capacity model. The selection of Mod-MeOH was made because it is more economically desirable than Mod-FT case and with more novel technology than Fischer Tropsch synthesis case. In Table 11 , the effect of plant capacity on different economical and thermodynamic parameters is shown as it is illustrated by the main results of each case. The two Capacities compared are 864t/d and 2000t/d of biomass feedstock in the thermochemical pathway of Mod-MeOH. For each parameter, the value is calculated and the percentage of the effect of plant capacity can be seen. 5.4.3 Comparison with biochemical pathways The processes of the examined biochemical pathways are based on other reports [30,109] along with their costs of equipment and operational costs. One biochemical pathway is based on Ethanol fermentation whereas the other is based on ABE (Acetone–Butanol–Ethanol) fermentation. The ethanol fermentation process [30] starts with the biomass (corn stover) being milled and washed. The pretreated biomass is then processed with hydrolysis and catalyzed using dilute sulfuric acid and heat from steam. During this step, most of the hemicellulose is converted to soluble sugars however some inhibitors may be formed. Afterwards, the hydrolysate slurry is fed to a conditioning reactor where ammonia is added in order to raise its pH to 5–6 so enzymatic hydrolysis can be achieved. Enzymatic hydrolysis converts cellulose to glucose using cellulase enzymes in a continuous, high solids reactor. Cellulase Enzymes, can be purchased [110] or produced on-site [30] through an aerobic cultivation of microorganisms. After enzymatic hydrolysis, glucose and other sugars are sent to the batch fermentation vessels where a bacterium is added that can ferment glucose and xylose to ethanol (separate hydrolysis and fermentation). Lastly, the fermentation broth is introduced into the distillation columns where ethanol is separated from water, CO2 and unconverted insoluble solids. In order to upgrade ethanol to aviation fuels, ethanol is fed to the upgrading area. The fermented ethanol follows the same processes mentioned before in Mod-FT scenario. Firstly n-butanol is produced through ethanol condensation, which via dehydration, oligomerization and hydrogenation is upgraded to aviation fuels. For the economic evaluation of the ABE fermentation scenario, the processes and costs are based on Qureshi’s report [109]. First of all, the biomass feedstock that is used is wheat straw. After being milled to 2–3mm particles, it is treated with dilute sulfuric acid and KOH/NaOH is added so the pH of the mixture can be readjusted. Continuously, enzymatic hydrolysis takes place and NaOH is added again to adjust the pH to 6.8. In addition, fermentation occurs with C. beijerinckii P260 for 42h producing ABE products. Finally, the recovery of products starts with a stripper that separates butanol with water from ethanol and acetone. Due to the fact that butanol and water form an azeotrope, they are separated by using a hydrophilic pervaporation membrane. As long as butanol is produced and separated, it is sent to the upgrading section along with ethanol. The butanol produced from fermentation is n-butanol, thus the processes following are the same described in Mod-FT scenario previously. Ethanol is condensed to form n-butanol and is added with the fermented butanol. Consequently, butanol via dehydration, oligomerization and hydrogenation is upgraded to aviation fuels. The process analysis on the ethanol plant, having been conducted by Humbird et al. [30], revealed an overall thermal efficiency 44.0% and the carbon utilization factor is 29.4% of the total carbon that enters the system (both feedstock and glucose). This low carbon utilization factor is due to the fact that only 59.6% of the carbon content on the corn stover is carbohydrates and is able to be converted into ethanol through fermentation. Contrary to the thermochemical routes, the power requirements stand for only 3.5% of the total energy input. The majority of carbon that exits the plant is in the form of CO2 that origins from the lignin combustion and from the fermentation process. Similarly, in the ABE case, the thermal efficiency of producing pure butanol is 40.4% and if take into account the heat content of the two other by-products (acetone and ethanol), the thermal efficiency is estimated at 65.8% [109]. The ethanol yield in the first biochemical route is 0.236kgethanol/kgfeedstock whilst the corresponding yield of butanol in the ABE process is 0.197kgbutanol/kgfeedstock. The production costs for ethanol and butanol are estimated 0.54€/kg and 0.78–1.01€/kg, respectively. According to the corresponding reports on ethanol and butanol production from fermentation [30,109], the corresponding alcohols are recovered from the separation unit in high purity (>99.9%), and thus for the process analysis, they considered as completely pure. For each biochemical case, the Capex and Opex costs of the upgrading section are added to the reference plant’s costs (bioethanol and bioABE plant production), after being simulated in Aspen Plus [108]. The only difference from the thermochemical cases in the upgrading section is the fact that the hydrogen, which is essential for the hydrogenation process, is purchased for 1.13€/kg [111]. Thus, the PSA unit is removed and not considered in the costing of equipment. All costs are scaled for 310 operational days/year and 2000T/day feedstock input and in 2011€. In the ethanol fermentation case, the Total Capital Investment was estimated at 473.83M€ with Operating Costs at 69.81M€. The scaled Total Installation Cost of the equipment used for the production of ethanol, derived from NREL’s paper [30], is at 195.26M€, whereas the TIC of the upgrading equipment of ethanol to Jet Fuel is calculated at 23.445M€. Regarding the ABE fermentation case, the TCI was estimated at 144.84M€ with Operating Costs at 143.74M€. The scaled TIC of the processes used for butanol production, derived from Qureshi’s paper [109], is at 69.15M€ with the TIC of the upgrading equipment of butanol to jet fuel at 11.87M€. After calculating the TCI, Operating Costs, a DCFROR analysis is carried out as described in previous section, in order to determine the Minimum Jet Fuel Selling Price (MJFSP). As mentioned above, the feedstock used for ethanol and ABE fermentation are the same from the corresponding papers, corn stover and wheat straw respectively (see Table 12). The feedstock prices and their compositions are described there. A cost figure of 48.69€/dryt [30] was used for corn stover whereas for wheat straw a figure of 18.12€/dry t was used [109]. In Fig. 15 , a comparison can be made between the two biochemical and thermochemical case, according to the MJFSP of each case. Both Biochemical cases are economically more desirable than the thermochemical Mod-MeOH case though the latter is adequately competitive. It should be reminded that in each of these cases, different feedstock is used, bought with different price. Consequently, the purchased biomass feedstock contributes variously to the MJFSP for each case. The BioABE case has significantly lower Capital costs than the other two, but double the operating costs. Moreover, it has importantly more credits from the by-products, as it is considered that apart from the gasoline that is sold, acetone is sold too according to the market’s price, 0.78€/l [109]. 5.4.4 Sensitivity analysis The effect of various parameters on the plant feasibility is discussed in this section. Fig. 16 demonstrates the influence of several parameters over the product value of jet fuel in each case. The parameter that has the greatest influence is the plant size as it decreases the MJFSP for 20% with an increase in plant capacity from 864 to 2000t/day. Another parameter with significant influence over the MJFSP is the biomass feedstock price that changes the MJFSP at ±13% for FT case and ±10% for Mod-FT and Mod-MeOH cases. Due to the fact that FT case produces a lot of by-products, it depends more on them than the other cases. Consequently, by changing the by-products selling price, the MJFSP of FT case is altered at ±13% whereas in the other cases for ±4% as the by-products that are produced in these cases are importantly fewer. The rest parameters have smaller influence over the MJFSP and can be seen in Fig. 16. According to Peters and Timmerhaus [94], the method for calculating the total capital investment has ±30% accuracy. Fig. 16 shows how the Minimum Jet Fuel Selling Prices from all 864t/day cases are affected by a ±30% deviation of the actual CAPEX vs prediction. With a 30% reduction in TIC, the Minimum Jet Fuel Selling Prices are 1.03€/l, 1.27€/l and 1.10€/l, for FT, Mod-FT and Mod-MeOH cases respectively, whereas with a 30% increase in TIC, the prices are 1.45€/l, 1.71€/l and 1.46€/l, respectively. A ±30% variation in the TIC, of the biochemical routes, affects the Minimum Jet Fuel Selling Price from 0.73 to 0.97€/l for the Bioethanol case, and from 0.78 to 0.86€/l for the BioABE case. 5.4.5 Investigation of setting the intermediate organic compounds as the final products The proposed Alcohol to Jet Fuel routes that are investigated in this study, produce several valuable intermediate compounds (small and high olefins and higher alcohols) during the upgrading processes of alcohols to aviation fuels. Alternatively, these compounds can be retrieved, separated and considered as final products, making them available in the market. This potential is examined in this section. In case where oligomers olefins are set as the final product, the hydrogenation unit, the PSA unit and the intermediate components (pumps, flash separators and distillation columns) are not considered for the costing. When the butene isomers are considered as the final products, the oligomerization reactor is not included in the costing method along with the above components. In case of considering the butanol isomers as final products, apart from the previously mentioned equipment, the dehydrating reactor is also excluded from the costing procedure. Moreover, the corresponding variable operational costs for each scenario are disregarded from the economic investigation. The purification step after each reactor is included. The only compound that should be removed from the product stream is water, which can be accomplished very effectively, since the experimental studies that the reactors modeling is based report 100% carbon selectivity on the desired products. The final products separation and purification (e.g. isobutene from n-butene separation or C12 olefins separation from C12 olefins, etc.) is not taken into account in this analysis. However, a rough estimation of the expected increase in the final minimum selling price is presented, based on the study of Salgado-Gordon and Valbuena-Moreno [113]. In this report, a techno-economic study of a light olefins purification plant is performed. According to this assessment, for an ethylene purification plant with capacity 180kt/year, the estimated CAPEX and OPEX was around 20M€ and 20M€/y, respectively. Taking into account that the annual production of the organic compounds in the fuel upgrading unit is of the order of 35kt/year, the CAPEX and OPEX of the whole biorefinery are expected to rise by 4% and 11%, respectively. Hence, the increase in the minimum selling prices of the intermediate organic compounds that are presented in Fig. 17 is not expected to be more than 10%. As it is extracted from Fig. 17, the concept of producing valuable organic chemicals is quite promising, since the resulting products prices are relative close to the corresponding current prices of the petrochemical derived chemicals. Especially, the biochemical routes can potentially compete with the petrochemical based organic compounds (lower and higher olefins and alcohols) industry. Furthermore, more motivation is gained for the improvement of thermochemical routes in the near future since they seem more competitive in case of producing valuable olefins and C4 isomers."
13,Further discussion and conclusions,"Fig. 18 presents the product value of various biofuels products from selected studies in the literature, compared to the corresponding values resulted from the proposed pathways in this study. For each study, the end product is expressed in €/GJ on HHV basis, so there can be a comparison between the biofuels on equal terms. With red and blue color markers the fuels produced by thermochemical and biochemical pathway respectively are presented. From the distribution of the prices, a clear conclusion can occur: The biofuel’s price tend to increase as the years go by. The most recent studies shows a 200–300% increase in biofuel’s price from the older ones. In other words, as the years pass, a more accurate estimation can be made, resulting in higher fuel prices, despite the fact that the technological developments have a beneficial contribution to the efficiency enhancement of each concept. Moreover, the value of the money changes due to inflation and the cost of equipment increases as new technologies arise. Finally, the price of feedstock continuously increases, having a great contribution to the product cost as it has been seen through the previous graphs. In this study, a novel concept for biomass derived aviation fuel-mainly jet fuel-blends, produced via thermochemical route, is examined. Two main pathways based on mixed alcohols are modeled. Simulations results reveal quite high performance for both process configurations achieving a jet fuel production rate 0.138kgJF/kgfeedstock in modMeOH case. The carbon balance along the process indicates that only 1/3 of the available carbon is found in the final product due to CO2 production in several process steps such as the gasification, water gas shift, alcohol synthesis and tail gas combustion. Comparing to the conventional FTS case, it is shown that the mixed alcohols routes can achieve higher jet fuel productivity rates and better carbon utilization despite the higher power consumptions that are observed. The CO2 valorization through hydrogenation and higher alcohols production does not results in improved plant performance due to high power requirements. The water balance of the proposed bio refinery system shows that very large amounts of fresh water are required for the stable operation of such a large scale application. It was revealed that the demands for fresh water to compensate the released H2O at the cooling tower and at the stack, for a plant with 190MWth heat capacity are 23.7kg/s, emerging the water management as an important issue with considerable environmental impacts. Additionally in this paper, the economic feasibility of a facility producing bio-based aviation fuels via alcohols derived either from biomass gasification or fermentation is also investigated. All the examined concepts are still far from global commercialization and market predominance over the “conventional” jet fuel, derived from fossil fuels, mainly due to the high biomass price and the high investment cost. From the analysis on the thermochemical pathways, it is concluded that even though the Alcohol to Jet fuel concepts (ATJ) have better performance than the FTS route in terms of carbon utilization and thermal efficiency, the expected jet fuel price is higher. This is attributed to the higher CAPEX, especially in the Gas Cleaning Area and the Power Island. However, future developments on catalysts dedicated to mixed alcohol synthesis, regarding the enhancement of HA selectivity against light hydrocarbons, would contribute to the further improvement of the concept. Moreover, catalysts with improved selectivity would decrease recycling streams, resulting to a decrease in the size of equipment and bringing down the CAPEX. In addition, further attention should be given to the acid gas removal equipment that contributes most to the CAPEX. Apart from the method used on the current paper (Rectisol™), other methods, e.g. amines, should be examined in future works as they could decrease the product price of jet fuel. Regarding the biochemical cases, a direct comparison with the thermochemical cases should be avoided as different feedstock is used in each case, purchased with different price. However, overlooking this fact, the Acetone–Butanol–Ethanol (ABE) fermentation based biochemical process is considered as the most economically preferable option in spite of its high operational cost, due to the required chemicals and enzymes as well as the high power demanding final product’s separation. The economic investigation of these alcohol based concepts indicated that providing the organic compounds, that are produced intermediately (i.e. light and heavy olefins, C4 alcohol isomers), can be a promising option for the feasibility of such biorefineries plants."
