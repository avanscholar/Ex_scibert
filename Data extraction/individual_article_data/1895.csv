0,Introduction,"The global industrial development in the past century heavily depended on consumption of fossil fuels, not only causing concerns on depletion of the nonrenewable energy source, but also leading to the global warming issue due to greenhouse gases (GHG) emission. A large portion of current fossil fuel reserves (1/3 of oil, 1/2 of natural gas, and more than 4/5 of coal) should remain unused up to 2050 to meet the 2°C target for GHG control over the 21st century (Mcglade and Ekins, 2015). Meantime, global energy demand is still increasing to nearly doubled by year 2050 (IRENA, 2015). To reduce the GHG emission with meeting energy demand, renewable energy supplies, such as biofuels from biomass, are desired (Balan, 2014). It is estimated that biofuel in total transportation fuel would grow up to 27% in 2050 (https://www.iea.org/newsroomandevents/pressreleases/2011/April/biofuels-can-provide-up-to-27-of-world-transportation-fuel-by-2050-iea-report-.html) Crop residues are produced from corn, wheat, and rice processing, with those from China contributing about 23% of corn, 18% of wheat, and 28% of rice over the globe in 2012 (FAOSTAT, 2012). About 0.5billion dry ton of crop residues were available in China (Jiang et al., 2012). Liquid and gas fuels, such as bioethanol, biobutanol, biomethane and biohydrogen can be produced from this abundant and renewable feedstock (Karimi and Taherzadeh, 2016). Among these fuels, hydrogen has the highest energy density per mass (142kJ/g) and produces no GHG while burning (Ghanavati et al., 2015; Hay et al., 2013). Global hydrogen market was estimated to grow annually at a rate of 6.2% from 2011 ($87.5billions) to 2016 ($118billions), with 88% of hydrogen being produced from nonrenewable energy sources, such as natural gas, heavy oil, naphtha, and coal (Hay et al., 2013). There are efforts for bio-hydrogen production from biomass and wastewater with microorganisms. Bio-hydrogen can be produced by: (1) bio-photolysis with cyanobacteria or green algae, (2) dark fermentation with anaerobic bacteria, (3) photofermentation with photosynthetic bacteria, and (4) microbial electrolysis. During bio-photolysis process, light energy is converted to free energy of hydrogen at a low efficiency (theoretical efficiency no more than 4.6%), which limits its application to a practical system (Hallenbeck, 2012). Dark fermentation also has a drawback of low H2 yields due to accumulation of volatile fatty acids. In contrast, photo-fermentation can use organic compounds, usually organic acids, as the substrates (Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2009; Keskin and Hallenbeck, 2012). Extensive reviews on dark fermentation are available; conversely, only few information on photofermentative hydrogen production from crop residues is available (Hay et al., 2013). Photofermentation bio-hydrogen production can be described by the following formula (CH3COOH+2H2O→2CO2 +4H2) using acetate as the model feed substrate. Chandrasekhar et al. (2015) commented on the advantages and disadvantages for photofermentative hydrogen production. Uyar (2016) summarized the concerns for designing the photofermentative bioreactor. This mini-review focused on the research progress in photofermentative hydrogen production using crop residues as feedstocks, considering the aspects of feedstock types, pretreatment methods, photosynthetic bacteria, reactors, and operational strategies on hydrogen productivity. Perspectives for future studies in photo-fermentative hydrogen production from crop residues are highlighted."
1,Crop residues,
2,Status of the crop residue resources,"2.1 Status of the crop residue resources Agriculture and forestry are the two sources of renewable carbon sources that can be used for energy production (Chandra et al., 2012). Compared to forestry residues, agricultural waste usually has higher cellulose and hemicellulose contents and lower lignin contents, making them more favorable for bio-energy production. Annually, a large quantity of crop residue is produced in the world (Lal, 1995). The primary crop residues can be categorized into cereal crop residue, leguminous crop residue, root crop residue, and oil seeds residue. In terms of the total residue production quantity, cereals are the most important residue stream than the other three. The main worldwide production of cereal crop residue is composed of rice straw, wheat straw, corn stover, and sugarcane bagasse (Bakker et al., 2013). Due to the different demands of the crops on climate and availability of water, the four major straws can be collected from different locations: rice straw and wheat straw are mostly produced in Asia, America is the major producer of corn stover and sugarcane bagasse (Sarkar et al., 2012). The composition of various constituents in crop residue varies from one plant species to another. Table 1 presents the chemical compositions of the four major crop residues and illustrates the annual productions in China. Among the major 4 crop residues, corn stover is the largest crop residue stream in China (327.4millionton/year). Conversely, production of sugarcane bagasse is much lower in quantity than other three crop residues."
3,Bio-hydrogen production from the crop residues,"2.2 Bio-hydrogen production from the crop residues Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin are main components of crop residues. Cellulose is a polysaccharide with β-1,4-glycosidic bonds. Crystalline cellulose is resistant to digest while amorphous cellulose is more readily to be digested. Hemicellulose is polysaccharides of mono-sugars and uronic acids with randomly branched heterogenetic structures (Lin et al., 2015). Hemicellulose itself is usually amorphous in structure, thus is easy to digest. However, hemicellulose can interact with cellulose and lignin to form a network structure which increases the recalcitrance of biomass. Lignin is a class of complex heteropolymers of aromatic alcohols, and is the most recalcitrant component of lignocellulose. The rigid three-dimensional cross-linked matrix, composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, resists hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. Photofermentation enables the conversion of organic substrate to hydrogen by anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria to carbon dioxide and biomass (Ghimire et al., 2015). In this process, both the reducing power from oxidation reaction of organic compounds and the energy deriving from light reduce H+ to H2 gas (Adessi and de Philippis, 2012). Photofermentative hydrogen was yielded by nitrogenase of photosynthetic bacteria coupled with photosynthetic phosphorylation. Since these bacteria exhibit a photosystem not powerful enough to directly split water molecules, the electrons from oxidation reaction of organic substances are transported through electron carriers to pump protons through cell membrane to produce ATP. Then part of the used electrons is sent to ferredoxin, which drives electrons to nitrogenase with the formed ATP to produce hydrogen under nitrogen (NH4 +) starving conditions. The crop residues are incorporated proteins and amino acid-containing substances, whose hydrolysis generate high contents of ammonium ions under anaerobic and neutral and alkaline condition. Pre-oxidization step may be needed to convert ammonium to nitrate for prevent severe inhibition on anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria in photofermentative hydrogen production."
4,Pretreatment of the crop residues,"2.3 Pretreatment of the crop residues The substrates containing starch and cellulose need pretreatment to be depolymerized into simple organic matters (Keskin et al., 2011). Hence, photofermentative hydrogen production from crop residues with photosynthetic bacteria is basically the utilization of simple monomers which are the products of saccharification rather than of the recalcitrant biomass directly. Pretreatments can be achieved through physical pretreatment (grinding, steam-explosion, extrusion, imposing irradiation, hydrothermolysis), chemical pretreatment (acids, bases, ionic liquids), and/or biological pretreatment (enzymes, fungus) (Yang et al., 2015a,b). Pretreatment for hydrogen production from crop residues, such as corn stalk, sugarcane bagasse, and wheat straw, has been studied (Reginatto and Antônio, 2015). A few studies were reported on pretreatment of crop residues for photo-fermentative hydrogen production (Mirza et al., 2013), particularly on pretreatment for dark and photo-fermentative hydrogen production from crop residues (Table 2 ). Water hyacinth, rich straw, barley straw, corn stalk, and corn cob have been studied for bio-hydrogen production via pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, and dark- and photofermentation. The maximum hydrogen yield through combined dark fermentation and photofermentation from treated crop residues ranged 463–752mL/g total volatile solids. Grinding pretreatment of crop residues decreased particle size and lowered structure crystallinity, which makes cellulose raw materials exposed to enzyme action for enhanced, follow-up hydrogen production. Steam-explosion pretreatment destroyed the cellulose internal hydrogen bond network and freed out new free hydroxyl for improved reducing sugar production (Jin and Chen, 2006). Acid made almost all hemicellulose but lignin in biomass to dissolve so can be used to spin off lignin from the feed stock (Kim et al., 2001). Alkaline pretreatment caused crop residues materials swelling, leading to increase in internal surface area and reduce polymerization and the crystallinity of biomass. Acid pretreatment was found to be more efficient than alkaline pretreatment for water hyacinth which has high contents of hemicellulose (up to 55% of dry weight). Su et al. (2010) pretreated water hyacinth using steam heating+microwave-assisted alkaline, and followed by enzymatically hydrolysis, to reach less than 60% of theoretical hydrogen yields in the follow-up combined dark fermentation and photofermentation steps. In another study, the fermentative hydrogen yield from water hyacinth was increased to 75.2% by microwave-assisted dilute H2SO4 pretreatment (Cheng et al., 2013). Alkaline pretreatment is efficient in lignin removal, and thus is more suitable for reducing biomass recalcitrance of crop straws that have high lignin content (about 22–29%). Cheng et al. (2010) used microwave-assisted alkali to pretreat rice straw, and obtained a maximum hydrogen yield of 463mL/g TVS via combined dark- and photofermentation. Yang et al. (2015a,b) studied the effects of NaOH delignification/enzymatic hydrolysis with cellulase and hemicellulase on dark- and photofermentative hydrogen from corn stalk, obtaining a maximum hydrogen yield of 594.4mL/g total volatile solids. NaOH concentration was found to be the most significant parameter followed by cellulase dosage quantity, temperature of hydrolysis reaction, hemicellulose activity, and hydrolysis time on hydrogen yields (Yang et al., 2015a,b). Mirza et al. (2013) investigated effect of dilute H2SO4 pretreatment and ammonia pretreatment on photo-biohydrogen production from wheat straw with Rhodobacter capsulatus-PK. Wheat straw was pretreated using 30% ammonia and then hydrolyzed with cellulase and β-glucosidase to obtain 712mL/L of hydrogen which was higher than those obtained by using dilute H2SO4 pretreatment (Mirza et al., 2013). Jiang et al. (2016) applied enzymatic pretreatment using cellulase at 50°C on corn stalk pith and then produced hydrogen using photosynthetic bacteria. The hydrogen yield reached 2.6mol/mol sugar consumed. Fermentation inhibitors, such as acetic acid, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and furfural, may form during pretreatment processes, especially those use high temperature and/or acids for a long time. Mirza et al. (2013) applied dilute H2SO4 on wheat straw biomass to produce hydrolysate, and then detoxify the hydrolysate with added Ca(OH)2. After filtration, more than half of HMF and all of the furfural were removed, while mono-sugars and acetic acid were retained in the hydrolysate (Mirza et al., 2013). The hydrogen production was increased from 254mL/L to 372mL/L due to the implementation of detoxification step, which revealed that yielded acetic acid can also be beneficial to the subsequent bio-hydrogen production step. Selecting proper pretreatment methods based on the compositions of targeted lignocellulosic biomass is critical for the success of subsequent fermentation process."
5,Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria,The selection of highly efficient hydrogen-producing strains and efficient engineered bacteria were the research focus of photo-fermentative hydrogen production fields. Through the breeding and modification of high-yield hydrogen production strains the photofermentative hydrogen production can gain advantages in market competition in transportation fuels.
6,Pure culture,"3.1 Pure culture Pure cultures of photosynthetic bacteria were applied to produce hydrogen from various substrates. These anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria can be classified into four phyla: purple nonsulfur (PNS) bacteria (Rhodospirillaceae), purple sulfur bacteria (Chromatiaceae), green nonsulfur bacteria (Choloroflexus), and green sulfur bacteria (Chlorobiaceae) (Chen et al., 2011). Among these organisms, PNS bacteria which contain photosynthetic pigments and are able to perform anoxygenic photosynthesis under anoxic conditions are used for photo-hydrogen production (Adessi and de Philippis, 2012, 2014). Most studies for photofermentative hydrogen production is realized directly using simple sugar monomers (such as glucose) or organic acids (such as acetate and butyrate) rather than crop residues since single culture normally lack of capacity in using mixed substrates. Also, the substrate for single cultures needs thorough sterilization and has high risk for secondary pollution on the culture. However, as Table 3 lists, several reports have employed pure cultures for photofermentative hydrogen production and dark-photo fermentative hydrogen production."
7,Photo-synthetic mutants,"3.2 Photo-synthetic mutants Numerous metabolic pathways exist in photofermentative hydrogen production, which are regulated by enzymes such as hydrogenase and nitrogenase. Use of mutagenesis and genetic engineering techniques to revise hydrogenase and nitrogenase to build uptake hydrogenase deletion or multiple nitrogenase expression of Rs. rubrum can significantly improve hydrogen yield from lactate+glutamate wastewater (Kern et al., 1994). A hydrogenase-deficient mutant by be inserted with the interfering hupl gene produces three times more hydrogen than the wild strain (Yoshino et al., 2006). Masukawa et al. (2002) found that the hydrogen production efficiency of cyanobacterium Anabaena dehydrogenase deletion (hoxL-) mutant had 4–7 times higher the hydrogen production rate than wild strain under the optimum conditions. The efficiency of hydrogen production was greatly improved by modified electron transfer chains of Rhodobacter capsulatus (Ozturk et al., 2006). In addition, using genetic technology to build oxygen-resistant hydrogenase to improve its tolerance to oxygen and other adverse environmental factors. The hydrogen-producing mutants with low light dependence are of research interests. Kim et al. (2006) concluded that the B875 complex is necessary for photosynthetic hydrogen production by photosynthetic bacteria and the mutants without B850–800 complex had enhanced hydrogen production rates. The mutants that can absorb less light at wavelength 350–1000nm than the wild strain would yield less pigments but generate more hydrogen (Kondo et al., 2002a,b)."
8,Consortia,"3.3 Consortia The crop residues usually contain a mixture of monosaccharides and complex, polysaccharides, which makes its conversion to hydrogen a challenging task (Keskin et al., 2011). Most researchers concerning this aspect claimed that the use of consortia can lead to higher hydrogen yield when dealing with the complex waste (Adessi and de Philippis, 2014). Utilization of consortia for fermentative hydrogen production is more practically feasible than those by pure cultures since the former are easier to operate and control, and may have a broader feedstock sources (Wang and Wan, 2009). Studies using consortia integrated dark-fermentation and photofermentation for conversion of the waste to hydrogen (Argun and Kargi, 2011; Argun et al., 2009; Keskin et al., 2011; Ozgur et al., 2010; Su et al., 2009). As listed in Table 4 , consortia have been used for photofermentative hydrogen production from crop residues. Although the units used in different studies are not consistent, the hydrogen yields with consortia are confirmed to be higher than pure culture. The maximum of hydrogen yield (7.2molH2/molglucose) from the combination of dark-photo fermentation with consortia is also higher than that with pure culture (6.85molH2/molglucose), indicating the consortia is efficient in fermentative hydrogen production. However, loss of consortia microbial community stability still challenges the success of fermentative hydrogen production processes."
9,Photobioreactor,"Photobioreactor plays an important role in bio-hydrogen production with PNS bacterium, which must be closed system, owing to the need to maintain anaerobic conditions and prevent H2 gas dispersion (Adessi and De Philippis, 2014; Basak and Das, 2009). Moreover, photosynthetic bacteria produce hydrogen under anaerobic conditions with light, which means that the reactor should have a high surface/volume ratio in order to have better distribution of light over the reactor volume (Boran et al., 2012). Several aspects, such as penetration of light in grown culture, area by volume (A/V) ratio, agitation speed, temperature and the gas exchange, should be considered in bio-hydrogen production with photosynthetic bacteria (Gilbert et al., 2011). Mixing method and light distribution and utilization are key issues which influence the performance of continuous operation and optimization of H2 production of the bio-hydrogen production systems (Adessi and De Philippis, 2014; Basak and Das, 2009; Eroglu et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2015). However, due to the electricity consumption, especially for illumination and mixing of the cultures resulting in energy input for the processed lager than energy output (Adessi et al., 2012). Design of simple, high-efficient, and low-cost photobioreactor is desired."
10,Design and operation,"4.1 Design and operation Although works have been done for photobioreactor design and operations and they have been widely used in the photo-biohydrogen production, these studies mostly focus on microalgal cultivation (Degen et al., 2001). Studies on reactor design and operational strategy for photofermentative hydrogen production, especially with agricultural residues as feedstock, is largely limited. However, the common constraints for the microalgal photobioreactors and the photofermentative bioreactor are mostly identical. Large light receiving surface area is required for light collection for satisfactory reactor performance (Lee et al., 2015). The viscosity of hydrolyzed crop residue is commonly higher than the substrates for microalgal cultivation, which would increase the pumping costs and mixing costs, and the flow patterns inside the photobioreactors would be different. Ooms et al. (2016) commented on the sunlight-to-biomass conversion efficiency and strategies, suggesting that the sunlight energy that can be adsorbed and the subsequent losses in the process, including the waste by exceeding saturation limits of photosynthetic systems, energy transduction, cell maintenance and others. The optical engineering strategies proposed by these authors, originally aiming at increasing microalgae cultivation efficiency, can be also applied for enhancing the photofermentative bioreactor performances. For instance, Sun et al. (2016) doped light scattering nanoparticles to planar waveguides for improving light distributions in their microalgae cultivation reactor. This design modification increased the illumination surface area/volume ratio by more than 10 times and the microalgae biomass production rate by 2.2 times. Light management, from collection, distribution to adsorption is the key for successful photobioreactor design for photofermentative biohydrogen production. By design geometry of the reactor, the common photobioreactors can be categorized into flat panel and tubular reactors, which can be further classified into with exterior lighting and interior lighting based on the location of light source (Boran et al., 2010). As shown in Table 5 , types of photobioreactors have been utilized in photo-biohydrogen production. The use of exterior lighting is higher than that of interior lighting. Tubular reactors may be the first and simplest type of reactor developed for photo- hydrogen production. Tubular reactor generally consists of one or multiple transparent tubes with same/different sizes. The structure can be single cylinder, parallel cylinders, or sinusoidal tubes. Compared with flat panel reactor, the tubular reactor has higher surface to volume ratio to allow the cells to be illuminated uniformly (Adessi and De Philippis, 2014; Boran et al., 2010). Moreover, the tubular reactor has enhanced hydrogen production rate and solid-liquid separation rate since the associated mass transfer rate between the liquid and the gas phase is high (Boran et al., 2010; Zabut et al., 2006). The main drawback is the limited diameter of tube for confined working volume, requirement for large footprints, high energy input due to high flow resistance in the tube, difficulty in temperature control, high material cost, and low light conversion efficiency. Column reactor is a modified version from tubular reactor. Column reactors can have multiple reactors which are connected in series or in parallel. A lab-scale serial photo-bioreactor was used in a study on hydrogen production with Rhodopseudomonas palustris WP 3-5 with hydrogen fermentation effluent (Table 5) (Lee et al., 2011). Flat panel reactors were firstly reported in early 1950s (Fern et al., 2008). The maximum permissible thickness for flat plate photo bioreactors is proposed to be 5cm since hydrogen production rate was first increased as thickness of reactor increases from 1 to 5cm, but was then decreased beyond 5cm thickness (Gilbert et al., 2011; El-Shishtawy et al., 1998). Compared with tubular reactor, flat panel reactors seem to have an identical configuration potential and were reported to be more economically feasible (Lehr and Posten, 2009). Zhang et al. (2015) compared the performances of three different photobioreactors with hydrolyzed corncob, finding that the baffle reactors which are designed based on flat panel reactor harvested the highest hydrogen yield (589.21mmol/L) and exhibited higher substrate conversion efficiency (40.48%) than bath reactor or tubular reactor."
11,Light sources,"4.2 Light sources Photofermentation can be performed with light as energy means that light is a critical parameter during the evolution process of bio-hydrogen. Indeed, light quality and source, light intensity, and light distribution into the photo bioreactors are the key issues to be considered in designing a photo bioreactor and optimizing the bio-hydrogen production (Adessi and De Philippis, 2014). The light sources frequently utilized for photo bioreactors are natural solar light, tungsten lamps, and Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). As shown in Table 6 , researches were conducted the experiments by using the three major light sources. Light conversion efficiency during biohydrogen production processes is relatively low (average of 1–5%, highest of 7.9%) (Yigit et al., 1999) (Table 6). For scale-up system, in order to achieve a stable and cost-effective photo-hydrogen, several strategies have been proposed to enhance photofermentative hydrogen production. Rapid mixing has been suggested based on the “flashing light effect” demonstrated by Patrick C (Hallenbeck and Benemann, 2002). Ogbonna et al. (1999) reported an internally illuminated stirred tank photobioreactor, using solar light collected with a device and distributed inside the reactor through optical fibers. This design makes it possible to use solar light for indoor photo-bioreactors. The device was equipped with a light tracking sensor which guides the lenses rotating with the position of the sun (Ogbonna et al., 1999). Exposure to light–dark cycles can also improve hydrogen production compared to continuous illumination (Miyake et al., 1999b). Chen et al. (2008) integrated the photo-hydrogen production using artificial and solar light systems. Besides, hydrogen production with mix strains that contains different photosynthetic bacteria with different photosynthetic features is also a promising scenario (Kondo et al., 2002a,b). In addition, light conversion efficiency for different types of bioreactors were evaluated, which can be used as the benchmarks for bioreactor design to improve light conversion efficiency and hydrogen production in individual applications (Miyake et al., 1999a,b)."
12,Mass transfer characteristics,"4.3 Mass transfer characteristics Reactor size and structure, flow rate and pattern determines the flow field in bioreactor (Zhang et al., 2014b). Relationship between the reactor volume, reflux ratio, temperature and hydrogen yield, and the energy balance in the dark-fermentation bio-hydrogen production was examined (Obazu et al., 2012). To enhance the mass transfer by swing flow in plate bioreactor (Gilbert et al., 2011) or by medium shaking (Li et al., 2009b) would increase the maximum hydrogen yields. The photo-fermentation bio-hydrogen production system from crop residues with a high concentration of solid phase, high viscosity and low light transmittance needs extensive mixing; a novel reactor design with minimum mixing power input is desired."
13,Use of photofermentation to produce biohydrogen from crop residues,"Chen and Chang (2006) combined the interior light (side-light optical fiber) and exterior light (tungsten lamps) system for photo-hydrogen production with an indigenous PNS photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris WP3-5, resulting in a maximum hydrogen production rate level of 43.8mL/L/h. An interior lighting reactor for photo-fermentative hydrogen production was developed by Henan Agricultural University, which had a light source inserted via optical fiber, and incandescent lamps were use as complimentary light source, obtaining the highest hydrogen production rate of 36.6mL/L/h by using swine manure wastewater as substrate (Zhou, 2007). There is room for further improvement on light conversion efficiency with modified reactor resign; however, the related studies are largely lacking in literature. The crop residues hydrolysates generally contain excess fine particles than the feeds to other related photo studies such as those on microalgal cultivation. The excess fine particles would largely affect the light distribution and utilization efficiency and lead to severe fouling on the transparent surfaces of the photoreactors. Anti-fouling surfaces may be a must for the revised photofermentative biohydrogen reactors (Kim et al., 2015). The efficiency for photofermentative hydrogen production is about two orders of magnitude less than that for dark fermentation pathways since the growth rate for anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria is much lower than the fermentative bacteria. Therefore, the reactor size for the former should be much larger than the latter for unit hydrogen production rate. However, the photofermentation process can theoretically completely convert organic substances into hydrogen, which cannot be achieved using dark fermentation processes. Proper pretreatment methods should be selected for different crop residues according to their composition. Further efforts are needed to optimize pretreatment methods, increase effectiveness of photo bioreactors, and commercialize these technologies. The cost for photofermentative hydrogen production process remains high to be competitive in the current market (US Department of Energy set up the goal of biohydrogen production cost of 2.6USD/kg-H2). Taking a hydrogen production rate at 50mL/L/h, 10h time period with sufficient sunlight, the production of one kg of H2 with density 0.08kg/m3 requires 25m3 reactor volume. Taking a planer reactor with thickness of 5cm, the foot print of the reactor is 500m2. Hence, to minimize the operational cost with reactor performance enhancement is not a feasible option. Coproduction of valuable products with the hydrogen may provide the financial niche. The production of hydrogen and polybeta-hydroxybutyrate via photofermentation process demonstrated by Corneli et al. (2016) is an example for the proposed niche. Hydrogen has wide applications. Techno-economic analysis could help in reducing capital and operational cost for industrial application of the photo bioreactors."
14,Conclusions,"Few attention is paid to photofermentation for biohydrogen production since it has much slower productivity and needs excess light source to drive the reactions compared with the dark fermentation. Complete conversion of organic substrates to hydrogen is the main niche for photofermentation processes, however, the needs of extensive pretreatment and sophisticated optical management make the process uncompetitive to other biohydrogen production pathways. This mini review lists the current understandings to photofermentative biohydrogen production processes and comments on the needs for future researches."
