0,Introduction,"Coal, lignite, oil and natural gas have been used over 100 years both in the power and chemicals production industry and have been the prime energy sources of the global economy. Important issues such as climate change, reduced fossil fuel resources, coupled with increased prices lead to efforts to supplement fossil fuels consumption by renewable biomass resources, which are abundant and unexploited. The realignment of the chemical industry from a petrochemical refining based to a biorefinery based has attracted a lot of attention and the feasibility of this concept has become a national goal of many countries [1]. Bioethanol is the most common 1st generation biofuel, currently being produced from the fermentation of sugars i.e. using edible biomass as feedstock. Gasification of biomass to synthesis gas (H2/CO), followed by catalytic conversion of syngas, could produce significant amounts of ethanol, plus higher alcohols that could be used as additives into transportation fuels without competing with the food sector. The latter is a second generation biofuel approach and is regarded by many as a way to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by replacing part of fossil and thus higher CO2 footprint energy sources [2–5]. Except from the production of methanol and ethanol, and Fischer–Tropsch liquids' potential uses in automotive sector [6], extensive research efforts have been focused in the production of higher alcohols (HA: C2–C4 alcohols), and in the development of active and selective catalysts [7–10]. The resulting alcohols mixture could be used directly as fuel, as fuel additives for octane or cetane enhancement, as oxygenate fuel additives for environmental reasons, and as intermediates to form other fuel components as well as for the production of solvents or other chemical sub-processes in the chemical industry. HA gained ground against other bioliquids, because they have a wide range of uses as final products or as key intermediate components for the chemical industry. The most common HA alcohol is ethanol (CH3CH2OH). Apart from being a fuel already produced by 1st generation biofuel routes, it has major industrial uses such as its conversion by oxidation into acetaldehyde (CH3CHO). It is also used in the preparation of various derivatives, such as ethyl chloride, in plastics production etc. As a fuel, it is suitable for internal combustion engines (ICE) [6]. The next HA is propanol, and its principal use is in the production of acetone, which is used extensively as a solvent and as a starting compound in the manufacture of numerous other organic compounds. Butanol is claimed to have good qualities for direct replacement of gasoline [11]. Even higher HAs are produced in large quantities and they have a wide range derivatives used in the production of resins, paints, polyester fibres and other applications [12,13]. The biorefinery concept focuses on replacing the resources currently used (mainly natural gas) to transform biological raw materials into industrially useful intermediates up to end products. The production of HA in a biorefinery application could involve two different pathways: the first one is the biochemical conversion of biomass derived sugars though alcoholic fermentation (adopted in Brazil and the United States). The second route is via thermochemical conversion of biomass which offers a more effective means for the recovery of the energy content of biomass in a direct way and shorter times. Important thermochemical processes used for the production of highly energetic gaseous fuel are: (a) pyrolysis achieved in the absence of oxidant and (b) gasification, i.e. the thermal decomposition and reaction of biomass occurring with the help of an oxidant such as pure oxygen or air (autothermal process) or steam (allothermal) to yield a combustible gas rich in carbon monoxide and hydrogen [7–10]. In the present work, an energetically self-supported biorefinery section is designed for two different feedstocks: i.e. woody biomass and the pulp and paper industry by-product: black liquor. The latter is one of the largest concentrated biomass sources available in regions with many large pulp and paper industry units (i.e. northern Europe, etc.). Since the pulp industry has already tackled the logistics of handling huge amounts of wood it is more likely that their by-product is used apart from producing energy in recovery boilers, for the production of biofuels. Nevertheless, the production of syngas from solid biomass is a primary future target in case of the absence of an existing relevant industry. In all cases a biorefinery has to function without any requirements for energy above the levels its primary feedstock can cover. This study describes in detail the entire sub-processes and simulation methodologies in Aspenplus™ process simulation tool. A detailed bibliographical search is performed into works employing this software for the evaluation of biorefinery operations based on syngas [14–18]. The modelled sections are the gasification (both black liquor and solid biomass), the oxygen production, the gas cleaning and removal of acid gas components and finally the production of HA (in two different cases fashions depending on the catalyst employed). The envisaged process could well function from sizes of 100 to 400 MW thermal input of biomass [19], with the first being the basis for the calculations."
1,Process description,"Α simplified flow diagram for the process is shown in Fig. 1 . Both wood based circulating fluidized bed gasification and black liquor gasification are shown in cases (a) and (b). All major processing steps for the conversion of wood or black liquor to syngas via oxygen gasification are apparent: the air separation unit, the gas-cleaning system and the catalytic synthesis of HA. Each process area in the scheme is described below."
2,Air separation unit,"2.1 Air separation unit A cryogenic separation unit is required in order to produce a highly pure oxygen stream. Cryogenic distillation separates oxygen from air by liquefying at low temperatures. Ambient air is compressed in three stages via a compressor with inter-cooling and further cooled with chilled water. Residual water vapour, carbon dioxide, and atmospheric contaminants are removed in molecular sieve adsorbers. The cooling of air to cryogenic temperatures is achieved by heat exchanger and the required cooling loads derive from the already cold product streams. Such a configuration can reach to an oxygen purity of up to 98% [20]. For further oxygen purification, an extra column for argon separation would be required."
3,Gasification,"2.2 Gasification Over the past decades many different gasifier types have been developed. Nevertheless for the sizes of a biorefinery operation i.e. well over 30 MW thermal input, only two technologies have the maturity to be considered for current or near future application. A circulating fluidized bed (CFB) gasifier is recommended for solid fuels with diverse textures and moisture levels. If the biomass is in the form of liquid (such as in black liquor) or solid without serious problems and energetic requirements for its partitioning down to fine particles (<1 mm), then an entrained flow system can also be considered. Gasifying woody biomass in circulating fluidized beds and black liquor in entrained flow gasifiers has many differences in operating conditions, quality of produced gas etc. The typical chemical analyses of both fuels adopted are presented in Table 1 . Primarily, the gasification temperature in a CFB is below 1000 °C compared to entrained flow reactors that surpass this (up to 1200 °C) [13,21]. Most of the times, entrained flow reactors are designed to operate with a specific fuel. The raw product gas from an entrained flow reactor has a lesser load of particulates (unconverted char) as well as tars due to its usual higher operating temperature as it is common that these systems operate in ash melting regimes. Both systems can operate at elevated pressures but black liquor gasification is technically easier to accomplish (pressurized feeding or liquids is easier). Therefore such a system can deliver gas more easily at closer to the operating pressures required for HA synthesis. Black liquor product gas yields high H2S concentrations. This sulphur is recovered either by employing a downstream Claus process or by absorption in the green liquor from where and it can be returned to the pulp mill [19]."
4,Gas cleaning,"2.3 Gas cleaning The basic product gas impurities are: particulates (inert material, fly ash, unconverted carbon called char), tars (condensable heavy hydrocarbons with molecular weight higher than benzene), sulphur species (mainly H2S, COS and mercaptans), halogen species (HCl, alkali chlorides), nitrogen species (NH3, HCN), alkali species, as well as volatile metal traces [22]. For most of the catalytic systems, these have to be removed to a certain extent by gas-cleaning technologies. A certain amount of tars and alkali species are removed in filtration systems downstream the gasifier together with the particle matter, whereas water and oil scrubbers or thermal cracking catalysts in cold and hot gas cleaning processes can be added for further elimination of these impurities. The desulphurization step is essential in the process as sulphur causes poisoning and limits the life duration of the catalysts used in the production of higher alcohols. According to Ref. [23], hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbonyl sulfide (COS), and mercaptans are reported to have a tolerance concentration level lower than 1 cm3 m−3 for both Cu–Zn and MoS2 catalysts cases, while in Ref. [24] the MoS2 catalysts are reported to have a less strict tolerance of 50–100 cm3 m−3 is reported. The most commonly used cold desulfurization methods are chemical absorption in alkaline–water solution or in alkanolamines or physical solvents (Rectisol™, Selexol™) whereas in hot methods catalytic conversion and solid sorption are used [25]. Black liquor-fired entrained flow gasifier produces much more sulphur species compared to the wood derived product gas in CFB. The sulphur contained in BL is mainly converted to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) while some reacts with sodium carried in the fuel for the formation of green liquor. A comparison of H2S levels for the two gasification systems is shown in the Results sections. Although, H2S can be retrofitted to the green liquor for the conversion to white liquor and further efficient use in the pulp's industry digester, the present work focuses only in the removal of H2S. Selexol™ and Rectisol™ are the mostly known processes for the removal of both H2S and CO2 involving di-methyl-ethers of polyethylene glycol and refrigerated methanol respectively. The operating pressure of Selexol™ process is lower than that of Rectisol™, usually 0.2–1.4 MPa. Selexol™ has greater selectivity ratio (H2S to CO2) than Rectisol™ and therefore is selected for sulphur removal. After the solvents regeneration, the hydrogen sulfide can be directed to either a Claus unit for conversion to elemental sulphur or in the case of black liquor to cover sulphur needs for the conversion to white liquor. Better ratios of absorbed H2S to CO2are achieved with lower temperatures. In the Rectisol™ process, which has comparably less energy consumptions than the Selexol™, the solvent is cold methanol at approximately −60 to −75 °C, which dissolves the acid gases from the feed gas at relatively high pressure, usually 2.5–6.0 MPa. The rich solvent containing the acid gases is then depressurised to release and recover the captured species. The Rectisol™ process can operate selectively to recover the remaining carbon dioxide."
5,Alcohol synthesis unit,"2.4 Alcohol synthesis unit The HA synthesis is performed after the gas is compressed at relatively elevated pressures (8.0 MPa) and depicts higher selectivity at around 325 °C. The mechanism for HA synthesis involves a complex set of reactions with multiple pathways, leading to a variety of products that are impacted by kinetic and thermodynamic constraints [26]. Depending on the process conditions and catalysts used, the most abundant products are typically mixed alcohols (C2–C4), methanol, hydrocarbons and CO2. Linear alcohols are produced in a stepwise fashion involving the synthesis of methanol followed by its successive upgrade to ethanol, propanol, butanol, etc. [27]. Therefore, the HA catalyst should have methanol synthesis activity because methanol can be considered as a recurrent C1 reactant. Both branched and straight chain alcohols can be synthesized with but the present analysis does not go into that detail. In the present conceptual design, two different types of catalysts for HA synthesis, were selected: the modified methanol synthesis catalysts [28], the modified FT (alkalized MoS2 catalysts) [29]. The general HA synthesis reaction mechanism has the following overall stoichiometry, with n typically ranging from 1 to 8 [30–32]: (R1) nCO + 2nH2 → C n H2n+1OH + (n − 1)H2O In addition, apart from the desirable products (higher alcohols) and methanol that are formed, alkanes and carbon dioxide are also produced, according to the following reaction: nCO + (2n + 1)H2 → C n H2n+2 + nH2O The shift reaction is apparent in all cases: (R2) CO + H2O → CO2 + H2 (ΔH r = −41.1 kJ mol−1)"
6,Alcohol separation and recovery,"2.5 Alcohol separation and recovery The last stage of the alcohols production is the recovery unit. The configuration of this unit depends on the definition of “desirable final products”. In other words, the number of higher alcohol products that are required defines the number of separation columns. In all cases, light gases like hydrocarbons, H2O, CO2 and unreacted H2 and CO are considered undesirable and are removed after cooling at a first high pressure flash separator stage. In this case study, the “desired final products” are assumed to be the mixture of the higher alcohols rather than individual compound stream of ethanol, propanol and butanol, so only one column is used for the alcohol mixture recovery. The flow diagram of the HA recovery unit is demonstrated in Fig. 2 . Due to low conversion rates of CO, it is very important to recover light gases such H2 and CO for reuse. Moreover, other gas components such light hydrocarbons (HC) and CO2 should be removed before mixing with the main syngas stream. In the case studied, an autothermal oxygen driven steam reformer is considered to produce more H2 and CO from HCs. The light gases from the top of the first flash separator are split into two streams that are both throttled down to a lower pressure (2.6 MPa). One is led to the reforming step and the other to the gas turbine (GT) for power and steam generation in a small combined cycle. The size of the power is determined by matching its output with the heat and power demands of the overall process."
7,Steam production and power generation unit,"2.6 Steam production and power generation unit In order to meet the power and steam demands of the process, a steam cycle combined with gas turbine exists. A portion of the unreacted gases from the alcohol synthesis is led to the gas turbine to be combusted. The turbine exhaust gases provide heat for steam generation through a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). Additional heat recovery for increase of steam generation is performed through product gas conditioning and cooling. Part of the produced steam is used at the WGS reactor and the autothermal reformer, as heating source in the reboilers of the strippers (at H2S removal unit and alcohol separation unit)."
8,Methodology and model description,
9,ASPENplus™ modelling configuration,"3.1 ASPENplus™ modelling configuration Both solid biomass and black liquor gasification modelling are mainly based on chemical equilibrium by means of minimization of free Gibbs energy. The woody biomass modelling is based on an equilibrium model corrected for the methane content of the syngas based on a previous work [22]. In the case of black liquor the prediction of the gaseous products needs to be accomplished together with an evaluation for the liquid (smelt) products: therefore the task is performed using two separated Gibbs reactors (RGIBBS) for the two phases. The adoption of two distinct equilibrium calculations is due to the fact that an overall mass Gibbs minimization would fail to reproduce significant Na2S quantities which affect both gaseous and smelt compositions. The fate of elements between the two RGIBBSs is based on the ultimate/proximate analysis and on relevant studies [33,34]. The reason is that the smelt is formed possibly near the wall, at the post flame region [32]. Both woody biomass and black liquor elemental composition are reported in Table 1. Special effort is paid for black liquor enthalpy estimation, since it cannot be treated as a typical non-conventional material in Aspenplus™ because its ash content influences the chemical equilibrium and is not considered as inert. The separation of syngas from the smelt is conducted at the quencher that is simulated as a flash separator, assuming phase equilibrium. The black liquor model closely predicts the syngas produced (Table 2 ) [32], but most importantly is a tool to predict the energy balance around the gasifier and its oxygen requirements. The property method that is used at each unit of the biorefinery is shown in Table 3 , whereas the input parameters of the whole biorefinery are summarized in Table 4 . The selection of the suitable property method for each process unit was based mainly on the relevant to similar process design efforts works [16,35,36]. Gas cleaning from H2S and CO2takes place in absorbers assuming phase equilibrium at each of their stages. The most important aspect is to define the appropriate thermo-physical properties and equation of state in order to simulate the phenomenon of physical absorption and acid gas removal with high accuracy. In the CO2 removal unit, CO2 is sequestrated at two stages in flash separators after throttling the lean solvent. By using this configuration, the second column for stripping the Rectisol™ solvent is not needed. This unit requires power consumption for pumping and externally cooling the rich solvent before its introduction into the absorber."
10,Modelling of the mixed alcohol reactor (MAR),"3.2 Modelling of the mixed alcohol reactor (MAR) In this study, the mixed alcohols synthesis is investigated for two different types of catalysts based on the corresponding kinetic expressions obtained from the literature. For a rigorous investigation of the catalytic process, a plug flow reactor (RPLUG) in conjunction with an equilibrium reactor (REQUIL) is used. The RPLUG simulates the alcohol production in the MAR according to the kinetic rates of the reactions while the REQUIL follows the former in order to estimate the CO2 that is yielded from the water gas shift reaction. As far as the HAS with MoS2 catalyst type is concerned, and according to the Langmuir–Hinshelwood (LH) model, the reaction rate is expressed by the following equation, based on mass of the catalyst and the partial pressure of the components that take part in the reaction: (1) r i = A i ⋅ exp − E i R ( 1 T − 1 T o ) ︷ kinetic factor [ k 1 ∏ i = 1 N p i a i − k 2 ∏ j = 1 N p j β j ] ︷ driving force [ ∑ i = 1 M K i ( ∏ j = 1 N p j a j ) ] m ︸ adsorption The production rates of methanol, ethanol, propanol and methane are evaluated according to the kinetic model that is presented in Ref. [43]. Concerning the HAS over a modified methanol catalyst (Cs-doped Cu–Zn composite catalyst) the corresponding kinetic rates are obtained from the experimental study of Kulawska and Skrzypek [29]. In this study, the following power law expression is proposed: (2) r i = A i ⋅ exp − E i R T p H 2 n i However, in this study, the hydrocarbons formation is not taken into account, even though it is expected, according to similar studies [31,44,45]. The methane selectivity is assumed to an average value of 5% obtained from Refs. [31,44,45]. The expressions of the kinetic rates of the reactions that take place in the MAR and the parameters values are presented in Table 5 and 6 a and b respectively."
11,Results and discussion,
12,Comparison of the performance of two different catalyst types,"4.1 Comparison of the performance of two different catalyst types The stream results of the wood gasification system up to the MAR (mixed alcohol reactor) for both catalyst types are summarized in Table 7 a and b. Both cases have similar pressures and temperature profiles. Cu–Zn catalyst has a much higher requirement for recycling of methanol and unreacted gas. This results in slightly higher temperatures of that case after mixing with the unreacted MeOH stream. The corresponding mass flows (here indicated as ratios over raw biomass processed) result higher for the case of Cu–Zn based catalysts. In the case of MoS2 catalyst applied to wood derived gas (“case A1”), the CO and H2 conversion rates are calculated at 32.8% and 17.2%, respectively. On the other hand, the conversion rates when applying the modified methanol catalyst on wood derived syngas (“case B1”) are 7.7% and 5.2%. This means that the MoS2 based catalysts are far better in achieving greater productivities of ethanol and propanol per kg wood processed (Table 8 ). Cu–Zn catalysts still sustain their attributes towards MeOH production which increases drastically the requirements for gas recirculation. The reactor size at least triples compared to an ideal case of a single-pass reactor. The requirements of the system for steam and power determine the portion of the tail gas that is diverted to the power island. In case A1, this portion is 16.2% whereas in case B1 32.2%. Table 9 shows the results of specific energy consumptions for those two cases. Most power is consumed at the air separation unit for the production of pressurized pure oxygen stream, which is primarily used for the gasification and at the compressors for recycling of the unreacted syngas and recovered methanol at the main syngas stream. This is attributed to the low pressure of HAS recovery unit, as the pressure ratio of the compression is quite high (around 8.0). On the other hand, power consumptions for syngas compression are lower not only because of the lower pressure ratio (3.2) but also because of the low inlet temperatures of the gases coming out of the CO2 removal unit. The H2S removal unit has both high power and heat consumptions, for the solvent pumping and its total regeneration at the stripper, respectively. This is the major disadvantage of the Selexol™ process for acid gas removal but the reasons for its selection were described above. MoS2 based catalyst might be able to sustain H2S to few ppm higher, provided the WGS catalysts employed is “sour type”. As it is very likely that HA production from biosyngas might be first applied to black liquor gasification, these cases are also presented in Table 10 , comparatively to the wood based gasification. The product gas heating value from wood gasification is greater than that the corresponding of black liquor gasification. This is mainly due to the high ash content of black liquor that remains as liquid after the gasification in order to form the green liquor (reused in the pulping process). Although the H2S removal from BL syngas has larger energy and heat demands than the wood based gasification, the impact on total power consumptions is not considerable. Black liquor gasification has already found applications in MeOH production [19]. Assuming MeOH as a useful product that can be co-produced with higher alcohols widens the useful products list. This also reduces the power consumption attributed to methanol recirculation. Table 11 summarizes the black liquor towards mixed alcohol productivity including the cases of methanol as a product (cases C and D based on MoS2 and Cu–Zn catalyst respectively)."
13,Sensitivity analysis,"4.2 Sensitivity analysis In this section, sensitivity analyses of several operating parameters of the MAR are performed. 4.2.1 GHSV (gas hourly space velocity) Fig. 3 reveals the effect of the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV): lower values lead to higher production and selectivity rates by allowing the further completion of desired reactions. The flow rates of recycled gases are reduced together with power consumption. 4.2.2 Synthesis pressure and temperature Fig. 4 a shows the positive effect of increased pressures on the synthesis process. For operating pressures up to 12.5 MPa the alcohols productivity increases dramatically and the power consumptions for recycling are lowered. However, it should be noted that as the operating pressure elevates, the capital cost increases too. Fig. 4b shows clearly why 325 °C is considered the optimum temperature for HA synthesis [46,47]. 4.2.3 The effect of H2 to CO ratio Running a Gibbs free energy minimization equilibrium calculation for a H2/CO ratio of 2, and including the potential evolution of solid carbon in the clearly defined form of graphite C(s), at T = 325 °C and p = 8 MPa it is apparent that carbon atoms could be lost (thermodynamically predicted at a rate of 26%). This means that the catalyst system would suffer in long term operation with deposited carbon. Fig. 5 shows that if higher than the usually adopted H2/CO ratios were to be selected, the WGS reaction would have to be pushed by more H2O and resulting into loss of CO towards CO2. Therefore, a special care has to be given to the H2/CO to be high enough to avoid any carbon deposition on the catalysts but also maintains loss of carbon into the form of CO2 low."
14,Conclusions,"A process modelling of an integrated biorefinery for higher alcohols production based on black liquor gasification was setup in Aspenplus™. Modelling of two different catalysts types (Cu–Zn based) and (MoS2based) was integrated. The resulting systems were analysed for their energetic efficiency and the losses occurring in the major unit operations for both cases of using either woody biomass or black liquor. The results revealed that the MoS2 based catalysts are far better as far as productivity and efficiency compared to modified Cu–Zn catalysts that produce a lot of MeOH that requires separation recirculation. If this MeOH is a useful product then system efficiencies could be slightly improved. Operating pressure has a positive effect on higher alcohols productivity. Technically black liquor gasification can be accomplished more easily at higher pressures but high pressures also lead to elevated methane content in the product gas, which needs to be reformed. Co-produced hydrocarbons have a detrimental effect on efficiency since the energetic penalties of their separation, oxygen driven autothermal reforming and recycling are great. These penalties are mainly associated with the air separation unit and the compression power required for unreacted gas recycling."
