0,Introduction,"A novel and efficient bio-reduction system for the production of chiral alcohols from prochiral carbonyl compounds, involving Escherichia coli transformant cells co-expressing the genes of NAD(P)H-dependent carbonyl reductase and cofactor regeneration enzyme (glucose dehydrogenase, GDH), has been established [1]. For multi-purpose use of this bio-reduction system, as many NAD(P)H-dependent carbonyl reductases, exhibiting high potential such as broad substrate specificity, strict stereoselectivity and so on, as possible should be found and collected. Moreover, the system could also be applied to NAD(P)H-dependent reactions other than asymmetric carbonyl reduction. For example, the CC bond of ketoisophorone (KIP; 3,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclohexene-1,4-dione) is stereospecifically reduced by old yellow enzyme of Candida macedoniensis AKU4588 co-expressed together with GDH in E. coli cells to yield a chiral ketone, (6R)-levodione (2,2,6-trimethylcyclohexane-1,4-dione) [2,3]. Subsequently, (6R)-levodione can be converted to a double chiral compound, (4R,6R)-actinol (4-hydroxy-2,2,6-trimethylcyclohexanone), which is a useful chiral building block for the synthesis of a naturally occurring carotenoid, zeaxanthin, by E. coli transformant cells co-expressing the levodione reductase and GDH genes (unpublished data). In the course of screening for KIP-reducing microorganisms [2], we found that C. macedoniensis AKU4588 produced an enzyme catalyzing the NADPH-dependent carbonyl reduction of KIP to (4R)-hydroxyisophorone (HIP; 4-hydroxy-3,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclohexenone) in addition to the old yellow enzyme described above. Because the enzyme catalyzing the carbonyl reduction of KIP showed high stereospecificity, it might be another member of the carbonyl reductase library for our bio-reduction system. As a result of purification and enzyme characterization of the carbonyl reductase catalyzing the asymmetric reduction of KIP to (4R)-HIP, it was determined to be identical to the NADPH-dependent menadione reductase catalyzing a lot of carbonyl compounds, such as menadione, 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate esters and 2′-ketopantothenate esters, previously isolated from the same strain by us [4]. Here, we report the molecular cloning and overexpression in E. coli cells of the menadione reductase gene (mer) from C. macedoniensis AKU4588. Furthermore, using E. coli transformants co-expressing the mer and the GDH gene (gdh), the enzymatic production of (S)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate ethyl ester (CHBE), one of the important chiral alcohols, was carried out."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials KIP, and (4R)- and (4S)-HIP were kindly donated by Nippon-Roche Co., Japan. (R,S)-CHBE was prepared by NaBH4 reduction of 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate ethyl ester (COBE). The marker proteins used for molecular standardization were purchased from Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co. (Japan). The enzymes, vectors, marker DNA, oligonucleotides and other reagents used for cloning experiments were purchased from Amersham Biosciences (UK), Qiagen (Germany), Takara-Bio (Japan), New England Biolabs (USA), Invitrogen (Netherlands), Novagen (Germany), Difco Lab. (USA), and other commercial sources."
3,Microorganisms and cultivation,"2.2 Microorganisms and cultivation C. macedoniensis (AKU4588; Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Japan) was used as the enzyme source and the DNA donor. The organism was cultivated as described previously [2]. E. coli DH5α, BL21 (DE3), and JM109 were used as host cells for gene cloning and overexpression experiments. E. coli cells were cultured at 37°C in Luria–Bertani (LB) medium containing 1% tryptone peptone (Difco Lab.), 0.5% Bacto yeast extract (Difco Lab.), and 1% NaCl, pH 7.0. When necessary, ampicillin (100μg/ml) and/or kanamycin (50μg/ml) and/or isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; 0.1mM) were added to the medium. IPTG was added at 5h after starting the cultivation."
4,"Enzyme purification, activity assay, lysylendopeptidase digestion, and isolation of internal peptides","2.3 Enzyme purification, activity assay, lysylendopeptidase digestion, and isolation of internal peptides The menadione reductase activity was measured using menadione as a substrate, as described previously [4]. Enzyme purification was performed essentially as previously reported [4]. The purified enzyme was digested with lysylendopeptidase (Wako Pure Chemical Co., Japan) under the conditions given previously [5]. The peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a μRPC C2/C18 column (Amersham Biosciences, USA) with a SMART system (Amersham Biosciences) under the conditions given previously [2]."
5,N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis,"2.4 N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis The N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined by the automated Edman degradation method with a pulse-liquid protein sequencer model 491HT (Applied Biosystems, USA). The obtained N-terminal amino acid sequence was compared with those of proteins stored in the SWISS-PROT, PIR, and PRF protein databases. Sequence data were analyzed with Genetyx-Mac 11.2 (Software Development, Japan)."
6,Preparation of genomic- and plasmid-DNA,2.5 Preparation of genomic- and plasmid-DNA Isolation of total DNA from C. macedoniensis AKU4588 cells was carried out as described previously [3]. Plasmid DNA was isolated with a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen).
7,Cloning of part of mer by degenerate PCR,"2.6 Cloning of part of mer by degenerate PCR Oligonucleotide primer pools were designed based on the amino acid sequences of the N-terminal and internal peptides. The amino acid sequences ADTNIFKPI and GQKTFTYFT were used to model the oligonucleotide pools. The primers were 5′-GGIAA(T/C)GGITAA(T/C)T(A/T/C)GC(A/T/G/C)AA(A/G)CA(T/C)AT-3′ (sense strand) and 5′-TC(A/T/G)AT(A/T/G/C)GG(A/T/G/C)GT(A/G)AA(T/C)TCCAICCIA-3′ (antisense strand). The DNA was amplified by the PCR technique using a thermal cycler (T Gradient; Biometra, Germany). A 50μl volume of the PCR mixture comprised 180ng genomic DNA, as a template, 150pmol each primer pool, 200nmol dNTPs, and 1.5U ExTaq polymerase (Takara-Bio). One thermal cycle consisted of 94°C for 1min, 50°C for 1min, and 72°C for 1.5min. A total of 35 cycles were performed. The PCR product was cloned into the pT7Blue vector (Novagen) for TA cloning. The deduced amino acid sequence of the insert DNA in the pT7Blue vector agreed with those of the sequenced N-terminal and internal peptides of the menadione reductase gene from C. macedoniensis AKU4588."
8,Cloning of the full length mer by inverse PCR,"2.7 Cloning of the full length mer by inverse PCR After digestion of the total DNA with several restriction endonucleases, Southern hybridization [6] was carried out with a labeled probe prepared from the purified PCR product using an AlkPhos Direct Labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). A single genomic band corresponding to about 5kb resulting on digestion with EcoRI was chosen and circularized by self-ligation for use as a template for inverse PCR [7] for cloning of the whole gene sequence. Divergent oligonucleotide primers (IS: 5′-TGTCGATGCGTTGAACGAGAAGC-3′ (sense strand) and IA: 5′-CGGGGACGCAGTGTGTGGAACACATACT-3′ (antisense strand)) were designed based on the partial gene sequence obtained for PCR product. The PCR mixture comprised 250ng circularized genomic DNA fragment, 200nmol dNTPs, 100pmol each primer, and 2.5U ExTaq polymerase. A total of 30 cycles were performed under the following conditions: 94°C for 1min, 60°C for 1min, and 72°C for 4min. Then the amplified DNA fragments were ligated into the pT7Blue T-vector with T4 ligase (Takara-Bio), and then transformed into E. coli DH5α cells. The successful clones were identified by colony PCR, and then subjected to plasmid isolation and nucleotide sequencing to determine the whole gene length of the enzyme."
9,DNA sequencing,"2.8 DNA sequencing The nucleotides of the selected clones were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method [8] using a CEQ dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Beckman Coulter, Inc., USA) and an automated sequencer DNA Analysis System CEQ 2000XL (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). Sequence data were analyzed with Genetyx-Mac 11.2."
10,Construction of expression vectors,"2.9 Construction of expression vectors Attempts were made to overproduce the enzyme in E. coli BL21 (DE3) with the expression vectors pET-21a (Novagen). To express the full length mer, the sequences upstream the ATG start codon and downstream the TAA stop codon were improved by PCR using the chromosomal DNA, and the following two oligonucleotides as the template and primers, respectively. The sense primer (ExS: 5′-CATATGATGACATTTACAGTGGTGACAGGCG-3′) contained an NdeI recognition site (underlined), and the antisense primer (ExA: 5′-GAATTCTTACCCACGGTACGCGCCC-3′) contained an EcoRI recognition site (underlined). The PCR mixture comprised 250ng chromosomal DNA, 200nmol dNTPs, 100pmol each primer, and 2.5U Pyrobest DNA polymerase (Takara-Bio). A total of 25 cycles were performed under the following conditions: 94°C for 1min, 58°C for 1min, and 72°C for 4min. The PCR-amplified products were ligated into the EcoRV-digested pBluescript SK+ vector (Stratagene, USA), and then transformed into E. coli JM109 cells. After plasmid isolation, they were sequenced to verify that they had correctly encoded the mer. The plasmid digested with NdeI and EcoRI was ligated into the NdeI–EcoRI sites of pET-21a to obtain a recombinant plasmid (pETMER). pETMER was introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Plasmid pACGD, in which the gdh and the tac promoter were inserted into pACYC177 [9,10], was prepared according to the procedure described previously [11]."
11,Co-expression of both mer and gdh in E. coli cells,"2.10 Co-expression of both mer and gdh in E. coli cells For co-expression of both mer and gdh in E. coli cells, two compatible recombinant plasmids, pETMER and pACGD, were simultaneously introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells."
12,Preparation of cell-free extracts and enzyme assay,"2.11 Preparation of cell-free extracts and enzyme assay Recombinant E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring pETMER were cultured in 10ml of LB medium containing 100μg/ml ampicillin and 0.1mM IPTG at 37°C. E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring pETMER and pACGD were cultured in 10ml of LB medium containing 100μg/ml ampicillin, 50μg/ml kanamycin and 0.1mM IPTG at 37°C. After cultivation for 10h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 2ml of 10mM potassium phosphate buffer (KPB, pH 7.0), and then disrupted with an ultrasonic oscillator (Insonater 201M; Kubota, Japan). After centrifugation, the resulting supernatant was used for the enzyme assay. Menadione reductase activity was determined as described above. GDH activity was determined spectrophotometrically as described previously [11]."
13,Bioconversion of COBE to (S)-CHBE with E. coli transformant cells,"2.12 Bioconversion of COBE to (S)-CHBE with E. coli transformant cells With washed cells of E. coli BL21 (DE3) harboring pETMER and pACGD as the catalyst, the reaction was carried out as follows. The reaction mixture comprising, in 50ml, 100mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0–0.6mg/ml (0–0.784mM) NADP+, 100mg/ml (556mM) glucose, and washed cells of the transformant (obtained from 1000ml culture) was incubated with 50ml of n-butyl acetate containing 300mg/ml (1820mM) COBE at 30°C with stirring and pH adjustment to 7.0. The concentrations of COBE and CHBE in the organic layer were measured by gas-liquid chromatography as described previously [12]. The optical purity of CHBE was also determined by high-performance liquid chromatography as described previously [12]."
14,Nucleotide sequence accession number,2.13 Nucleotide sequence accession number The nucleotide sequence of the menadione reductase gene of C. macedoniensis AKU4588 has been deposited in the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ databases under accession number AB183149.
15,Results,
16,Purification of the enzyme and internal peptide amino acid sequences,"3.1 Purification of the enzyme and internal peptide amino acid sequences The enzyme showing menadione-reducing activity was purified from cells of C. macedoniensis AKU4588 according to the previous report [4]. In the course of the purification, the (4R)-HIP-forming KIP reductase activity was also acted in concert with menadione-reducing activity. The purified enzyme was digested with lysylendopeptidase, and several internal peptides were isolated from the hydrolysate. The peptides were successfully analyzed using a protein sequencer. A computer-aided similarity search for these amino acid sequences in a protein database showed the enzyme resembled ketoreductase of Zygosaccharomyces rouxii [13], methylglyoxal reductase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (YOL151w) [14], hypothetical protein of S. cerevisiae (YDR541c), and aldehyde reductase II (ARII) of Sporobolomyces salmonicolor AKU4429 [15]. The primers for following degenerate PCR were designed using the amino acid sequences of the N-terminal (ADTNIFKPI) of the purified enzyme and the internal peptide (GQKTFTYFT) estimated to be located in the C-terminal region from the results of a homology search."
17,Cloning of the gene encoding the menadione reductase,"3.2 Cloning of the gene encoding the menadione reductase The partial amino acid sequence of the menadione reductase was used to design sense and antisense primers for PCR. A 935bp DNA fragment was amplified by PCR using primers (sense and antisense) and C. macedoniensis AKU4588 genomic DNA as a template. The amplified fragment was subcloned into the pT7Blue vector, and then its nucleotide sequence was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of the inserted fragment was confirmed to be identical with the sequences of internal peptides. Therefore, this DNA insert of 935bp in the pT7Blue vector was considered to have been derived from the gene encoding the menadione reductase, and thus was used as a probe for its complete cloning. The DNA fragment, which was hybridized with the probe prepared from the PCR product of about 5kb generated on digestion with EcoRI was selected as a template for inverse PCR of the menadione reductase gene, based on the molecular mass of the enzyme. This was then used as a template after circularization by self-ligation in a reaction mixture diluted optimally. Using divergent primers (IS and IA), a 1.4kb fragment was amplified by inverse PCR. The DNA sequencing data for this fragment and the first PCR product led to a single nucleotide sequence. The sequence included one complete open reading frame with a length of 1035bp coding for 345 amino acid residues. No intron sequence was found in the mer. The calculated molecular weight was 38,740Da (Fig. 1 ). This result is in good agreement with the result SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified enzyme from C. macedoniensis AKU4588 [4]."
18,Comparison of the amino acid sequence of the menadione reductase with those of other proteins,"3.3 Comparison of the amino acid sequence of the menadione reductase with those of other proteins A computer-aided homology search in a database revealed that the menadione reductase showed significant similarity (at about 40% similarity) with hypothetical proteins of Debaryomyces hansenii (YOL151w homologous protein), Candida glabrata (YOL151w homologous protein), and S. cerevisiae (YGL039w, YDR541c, YGL157w), methylglyoxal reductase of S. cerevisiae (YOL151w), and ketoreductase of Z. rouxii. The sequence alignment is shown in Fig. 2 ."
19,Overexpression of mer in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells,"3.4 Overexpression of mer in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells For overproduction of the menadione reductase in E. coli cells, the mer was inserted downstream of the IPTG inducible T7 promoter in the pET-21a vector, resulting in pETMER. A cell-free extract of E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with pETMER exhibited high menadione-reducing activity. E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring pETMER induced with 0.1mM IPTG exhibited specific menadione reductase activity (56.2units/mg; Fig. 3 , lane C), which is an about 127-times increase in comparison to that of C. macedoniensis AKU4588 (0.444units/mg). The first 20 amino acid residues were identical with those of the deduced amino acid sequence of the enzyme from C. macedoniensis."
20,Bioconversion of COBE to (S)-CHBE with E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring pETMER and pACGD,"3.5 Bioconversion of COBE to (S)-CHBE with E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring pETMER and pACGD E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells, into which pETMER and pACGD had been introduced simultaneously, exhibited high activities of both menadione reductase and GDH (41.9 and 8.88units/mg, respectively; Fig. 3, lane D). So, COBE-reducing reactions with E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells co-expressing mer and gdh were performed. Preliminary examination of reaction conditions showed that the potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 was preferable for the reaction (data not shown). Washed cells of E. coli BL21 (DE3) harboring pETMER and pACGD were incubated with 300mg/ml COBE with 0.6 (0.784) or 0.1mg/ml (0.131mM), or without NADP+. With 0.6 and 0.1mg/ml NADP+, 298mg/ml (1790mM) and 281mg/ml (1680mM) CHBE was formed in the organic phase after 8 and 9h, respectively. The molar conversion yield of CHBE and the optical purity of the (S)-isomer were 98.1 and 92.2, and 91.5 and 91.6% enantiomeric excess (e.e.), respectively (Fig. 4 A and B). Even when the COBE reduction was performed without NADP+ addition, the reaction still proceeded, but slower than in the case of NADP+ addition. 259mg/ml (1550mM) CHBE was formed in the organic phase after 36h, the molar yield being 85.0% and the optical purity 92.1% e.e. (Fig. 4C)."
21,Discussion,"NADPH-dependent menadione reductase was isolated from C. macedonienesis AKU4588 [4]. This enzyme catalyzed the reduction of various carbonyl compounds, such as quinones, aromatic aldehydes and conjugated polyketones, with high stereoselectivity. Although it might have high potential for practical application to chiral alcohol production, there is little information about its protein and gene structures. In this study, cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding the menadione reductase of C. macedoniensis AKU4588 was successfully performed. The enzyme showed significant similarity with ones belonging to the 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/dihydroflavonol-4-reductase superfamily [16,17] in primary amino acid sequence. While the maximum similarity was only about 40% with hypothetical proteins from D. hansenii and other strains, NADPH-binding motif GXXGXXA was strictly conserved in the N-terminal region (shown in Fig. 2). These results suggested that menadione reductase of C. macedoniensis belongs to the 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/dihydroflavonol-4-reductase superfamily. This the first report applying the enzyme belonging to the 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/dihydroflavonol-4-reductase superfamily to the chiral alcohol production. In a previous study [2], two kinds of KIP-reducing activity were found in C. macedoniensis AKU4588 cells. One enzyme forming (6R)-levodione was identified as an old yellow enzyme family protein, and could be applied to the CC asymmetric hydrogenation of KIP [3]. Interestingly, the other one forming (4R)-HIP was identified as the NADPH-dependent menadione reductase previously reported by us [4]. Menadione, a typical substrate of NADPH-dependent menadione reductase of C. macedoniensis AKU4588, has a quite similar structure to that of KIP. The reaction product on menadione reduction could not be identified, however, the results presented here suggest that the product derived from menadione might also be a chiral compound. To overexpress mer in E. coli cells, a recombinant plasmid, pETMER, containing the full length of the menadione reductase gene under the control of the IPTG inducible T7 promoter was constructed. In the presence of 0.1mM IPTG, E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring pETMER showed 127-times higher specific activity than that of C. macedoniensis AKU4588 ones. In the co-expressing E. coli strain carrying two recombinant plasmids, pETMER and pACGD, the menadione reductase was overproduced as in the single expression strain carrying pETMER. As compared with the production level of the menadione reductase in the co-expressing strain, GDH was produced at a lower level (see Fig. 3). But the COBE reduction reaction with co-expressing E. coli cells proceeded quickly, so the cofactor recycling reaction was sufficient. The application of this enzyme to the asymmetric reduction of COBE to (S)-CHBE, which is an important chiral building block for hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors [18], was also attempted. The enzyme could tolerante high concentrations (up to 300mg/ml) of substrate COBE, but 400mg/ml substrate strongly inhibited the enzyme reaction (data not shown). So, the reduction reaction with 300mg/ml COBE was performed with or without NADP+. Three hundred milligrams per milliliter of COBE was almost completely converted to (S)-CHBE by E. coli transformant cells co-expressing mer and gdh under the NADP+-addition conditions (0.6 or 0.1mg/ml). The apparent turnover number of NADP+ added to CHBE formed was calculated to be 2280 and 12,900mol/mol, respectively. Even if NADP+ addition was omitted, the COBE reduction reaction proceeded, but the reaction velocity was less than half of that with NADP+. Because the K m value for NADPH of this enzyme was quite low (<5μM) [4], NADP+ naturally existing in E. coli host cells might function as a cofactor for COBE reduction. While the efficiency of the reduction reaction was quite high, optical purity of the product is not sufficient for the stereospecific production. Improvement of the stereospecificity of the enzyme through the directed evolution or protein engineering techniques is required for further application. In conclusion, one potent enzyme can be added to the carbonyl reductase library for a multi-purpose bio-reduction system."
