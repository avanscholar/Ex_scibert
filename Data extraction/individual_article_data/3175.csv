0,Introduction,"Fossil fuels are the most commonly utilized energy sources for most of the energy consumption process. The combustion of fossil fuel releases various gaseous pollutants, predominantly greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxide (SOx) and particulate matter, that are released into the environment, resulting in global warming and climate change. In addition, these toxic gaseous pollutants hurt human health, causing asthma, respiratory disorders, stroke, heart attack, and early death (Sinharoy & Pakshirajan, 2020). The increased energy demand and fossil fuel depletion require a new renewable energy source to fulfill the world energy requirements (Banu et al., 2020). Among the different forms of renewable energy, biomass-based materials are considered promising energy sources due to their economic feasibility and availability. Biohydrogen derived from natural organic materials (biomass) is a potential alternative as a low-carbon fuel candidate. Hydrogen has a high-energy yield (2.75-fold greater than other fuels i.e. 122 kJ/g of biomass) compared to fossil fuels or other carbon-based combustion fuels. Also, hydrogen combustion does not emit toxic air pollutants or GHGs, and only water is generated as a by-product (Kumar et al., 2017). Hydrogen can be derived from various materials including fossil fuels (such as natural gas, coal), organic wastes (such as plant, animal matters, fruit waste, vegetable waste, agricultural waste), as well as industrial wastewaters, including sugar, palm oil, and beverage industries through different biological technologies (Boodhun et al., 2017). Industrial wastewater is considered a major ecological threat throughout the world. Due to huge industrialization and anthropogenic activities, a large quantity of wastewaters was liberated from the industry. There is a need to treat the polluted environment and protect the ecological system from industrial effluent. Accordingly, coupling hydrogen production with the removal of contaminations addresses a promising choice to recover energy from wastewater. Industrial wastewater contains high organic content, which has the potential for hydrogen production using biological processes. Biohydrogen is produced by different biological technologies including bio-photolysis, microbial electrolysis, and fermentation techniques (e.g., dark-, dry-, and photo-fermentation) (Oceguera-Contreras et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021). Among all the methods mentioned above, hydrogen production by dark fermentation gains more attention due to its lower energy requirement, higher yield, and higher production rate. Hydrogen production through the dark fermentation process can utilize single or pure culture of the fermentative bacteria or a consortia/mixed culture. The choice of fermentative microbes plays a crucial role in the higher yield of hydrogen from organic sources in dark fermentation. The fermentative bacteria are accounted to be strong and can consume the wastes to produce biohydrogen. Various bacterial cultures are utilized for hydrogen production. In terms of oxygen resistance level, the microbial hydrogen producers (MHPs) are classified as obligate anaerobes, aerobes, and facultative anaerobes. Based on the preferred temperature range, the MHPs are classified as psychrophilic, thermophilic, and mesophilic bacteria. All those bacteria have distinct characteristics and need diverse treatment conditions for the production of hydrogen. Compared to obligate microorganisms, facultative anaerobes are mostly favored because they can survive even when the oxygen is contaminated. Different physical factors, including pH system, partial pressure, temperature, the composition of nutrients in the feedstock, hydraulic retention time, feed rate, explosive fatty acids, and mode of operation affect H2 production during the fermentation process. pH in the system is one of the most important factors, which affect H2 production by inhibiting the growth and microbial activity of MHPs during the fermentation process. Low or extreme pH inhibits H2 production by affecting the growth of microorganisms as well as the hydrogenase enzyme activity. Based on the carbohydrate consumption, higher H2 production was obtained at pH 5 under standard temperature–pressure conditions (Sivagurunathan & Lin, 2020). Increased H2 partial pressure in the reactor vessel negatively affects the H2 production capability of microorganisms, as explained by the Le Chateliers principle. The reason for the increased partial pressure in the reactor vessel is the uncontrolled accumulation of H2 in the vessel. Continuous removal of produced H2 and maintenance of a constant partial pressure resulted in a higher H2 yield (Junghare et al., 2012). Temperature is an important factor that is responsible for the growth of microorganisms, organic matter degradation, and hydrogen production. Fermentation for hydrogen production can be carried out at temperatures ranging from 15 °C to higher than 80 °C. The efficiency of hydrogen production varies based on the temperature range as well as the type of microorganism used (Chandrasekhar et al., 2015). For example, proficient hydrogen production was achieved at mesophilic temperature (30–49 °C) using a mixed culture of Clostridium sp. and Enterobacter sp., while maximum H2 production at thermophilic temperature range (50 – 64 °C) was attained using Thermobacterium sp (Chandrasekhar et al., 2015). Usually, better organic matter degradation was attained at a high temperature. Commonly the temperatures range from 25 °C to 60 °C are favorable for all the fermentation processes (Rosa et al., 2014). The substrate utilized for hydrogen production should provide sufficient nutrients for better microbial growth and activity. The carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio is the important parameter that plays a major role in microbial growth during the fermentation process and nitrogen is an essential macronutrient required for the synthesis of DNA, RNA, proteins, and enzymes. The lower (C/N) ratio results in reduced microbial growth due to an insufficient level of carbon, which results in the formation of ammonia. The lower C/N ratio promotes the accumulation of nitrate in the reactor vessel, which is harmful to the microorganisms (Abdullah et al., 2020). Nanotechnology also has a role in biohydrogen generation from organic wastes. Nanoparticles are capable of increasing the intracellular electron transfer and enzyme activity in microbial culture thus increasing hydrogen production. The purification of biohydrogen is another vital part of the process. There are different purification methods, such as membrane separation, pressure swing adsorption, chemical absorption, and cryogenic-based separation. Finally, the purified form of hydrogen extracted from the reactor vessel can be directly used as an alternative fuel for vehicles as well as in fuel cell systems including molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC), direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), alkaline fuel cell (AFC), solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), and polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) (Rahman et al., 2016). The present review aims to comprehensively evaluate biohydrogen production from different organic sources, including fruit waste, vegetable waste, agricultural waste, and different organics-rich industrial wastewaters. This review also describes the different hydrogen-producing mechanisms, especially on the fermentation technologies, such as dark and photo fermentation. The role of microorganisms and nanotechnology in hydrogen production and their applications in various fields are also discussed. Moreover, the current status and further improvements required to overcome the difficulties and limitations in the hydrogen production technologies are investigated."
1,Sources for biohydrogen production,"Biohydrogen is used in a wide range of industrial applications as the material for the production of valuable compounds. Hydrogen generation from both nonrenewable and renewable sources may be achieved using either a thermochemical or a biological technique. Renewable energy, such as solar energy, wind energy, geothermal, hydroelectric power, can also provide power to the electrolysis process to produce hydrogen (Show & Lee, 2013). Renewable resources for hydrogen production include biomass (e.g., agricultural waste, wood waste, etc.), municipal waste, and wastewaters from industries (Saratale et al., 2019; Shanmugam et al., 2020). The primary by-product of hydrogen production from fossil fuels is the emission of CO2, which leads to global warming (Hosseini & Wahid, 2016). This problem can be overcome by using organic waste as feedstock for biohydrogen production."
2,Organic waste,"2.1 Organic waste Organic waste is a low-cost substrate commonly used as a feedstock for generating biohydrogen. Organic wastes could be biomass resources from agricultural and agro-industrial waste, wood waste, livestock waste, municipal waste, food waste, waste activated sludge, and wastewater from industries (Urbaniec & Bakker, 2015). Converting organic waste to energy or fuel has a dual role in waste management and the production of clean energy (Salem et al., 2018). Organic waste acts as a suitable feedstock for biohydrogen production since it is abundant, cheap, and is enriched in carbohydrates, proteins, and nutrients. Production of hydrogen from carbohydrate-rich organic wastes, such as rice and potato, were found to be 20 times greater than that of fat-rich (such as fat meat and chicken skin) and protein-rich (such as egg and lean meat) ones (Kim et al., 2013). It is commonly found that biomass acts as an excellent source for hydrogen production (Lin et al., 2011). Hydrogen has been generated by using the first-generation biomass feedstock (i.e. crops that are enriched in starch, carbohydrates and sugars, such as sugar cane, corn, sugar beets and soybeans), second-generation biomass feedstock (i.e. waste lignocellulosic biomass, such as agriculture waste, livestock waste, forest residue, and wastewater), as well as the third-generation biomass feedstock, including the algal biomass (Nagarajan et al., 2020; Saratale et al., 2019). The organic waste resources used for biohydrogen production and their subsequent applications are described in Fig. 1 . 2.1.1 Agricultural waste Agricultural wastes are waste obtained as an output of agricultural activities. Agricultural waste includes waste generated during harvest, manure, and poultry waste (Obi et al., 2016). Agricultural wastes are one of the most abundant, cost-efficient, reliable, environmentally friendly sources. Since agricultural waste is rich in carbohydrates, they act as an excellent carbon source for biohydrogen production. Major crops, such as rice, wheat, and finger millet which are found abundantly in nature, are responsible for producing agricultural residues that are used for biohydrogen production. Straw, cobs, peelings, stalks, bagasse, and lignocellulosic residues are some of the crop residues. A total of 2802 million tons of crop residues are produced annually (Zabed et al., 2016). Agricultural waste contains lignocellulose as the main component, which is a complex carbohydrate polymer of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin (Kumari & Singh, 2018). The recalcitrant nature of the lignocellulosic biomass necessitates the use of pretreatment prior to biohydrogen production for higher yield and conversion efficiency. Pretreatment helps in the solubilization and subsequent hydrolysis of the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions to generate fermentable simple sugars (Khoo et al., 2021). The pretreatment methods can be physical, chemical, or biological. The chemical method is found to be the most efficient method. A high content of fermentable sugars is produced when chemical agents, such as NaOH, are used and are considered as the suitable alkali agent for the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass. Nearly 1500 million tons of animal manure are produced annually, of these 1284 million tons are cattle manure and 295 million tons are pig manure (Saratale et al., 2019). Inappropriate C/N ratio in livestock manure (e.g., swine manure) due to enhanced nitrogen content leads to hindrance of biohydrogen production (Yin et al., 2014). Biohydrogen production is mainly influenced by the origin of organic waste because of the presence of sulfide and ammonia. Consequently, it has been recommended that pretreatment of organic wastes may significantly improve the efficiency of biohydrogen production (Chen et al., 2008b). 2.1.2 Fruits and vegetable waste Food waste is the waste that is generated during production, processing, retail sales, and consumption of food. According to the United Nations of Food and Agriculture Organization, approximately one-third of the food produced for human consumption is either lost or wasted. Food waste usually comprises kitchen waste, blemished fruits and vegetables, cereal waste, and dairy waste. Among these food wastes, fruit and vegetable waste are considered as the important category of residues as they are found abundant in nature. Fruit and vegetable waste are the inedible parts of the fruits and vegetables that are discarded during the stages, such as collection, handling, transportation and processing. Approximately 5.6 million tons of fruit and vegetable wastes are annually produced in India (Sagar et al., 2018). Fruit and vegetable waste are disposed directly to the landfills which cause a nuisance to the environment due to its enhanced perishability. Production of fruit and vegetable waste results in both marketing losses and shipment & dumping costs, which thereby raises the operating cost (Scano et al., 2014). About 45% of human food accounts for fruit and vegetable waste which makes it an ideal candidate for biohydrogen production as it comprises necessary nutrients, biodegradability, moisture content, and high volatile solid content (Abubackar et al., 2019). In general, fruit and vegetable wastes contain high sugar and protein content, which can be biologically converted to hydrogen. Due to the complexity of the structure, the biodegradable substrate is less accessed in some fruit and vegetable wastes, which thereby leads to low hydrogen yield. Pretreatment is again necessary to enhance the production of fermentable sugars that are readily assimilated by H2-producing microorganisms for biohydrogen production (Dinesh et al., 2018). Apple pomace is the solid residue obtained after the processing of apples and is rich in acids, fibers, carbohydrates, and minerals. Thus, it could also act as a suitable substrate for the generation of biohydrogen after an appropriate pretreatment. In a study by Guerrero et al. (2016), apple pomace was subjected to slow pyrolysis for hydrogen generation due to its high lignocellulose content. Highest hydrogen production of 83% was achieved with thermophilic process (Guerrero et al., 2016)."
3,Organic matter-rich industrial wastewater,"2.2 Organic matter-rich industrial wastewater Industrial wastewater is the effluent generated by the industries during their manufacturing processes. Common industrial wastewater that could be used for biohydrogen production includes dairy, beverage, pharmaceutical, textile processing, food processing water, molasses, palm oil mill effluent (POME), and distillery wastewater. Industrial wastewater comprises organic matter, inorganics like copper, potassium, pathogens, and nutrients. Since industrial wastewater is easily accessible, cost-efficient, organic-rich, it could be a suitable source for biohydrogen production unless it contains certain toxic substances, such as low pH, high salt content, or heavy metals (Sivagurunathan et al., 2015; Veeramalini et al., 2019). The use of this wastewater for hydrogen production helps in the conservation of the environment with the simultaneous production of biofuels. Studies on using these wastewaters as the feedstock for biohydrogen production have been carried out by many researchers, which involves wastewater from food processing, distillery industry, beverage, cheese whey (Kumar et al., 2015; Ramos & Silva, 2018). The sugar industry generates wastewater that is rich in carbohydrates and sugars (such as maltose, sucrose, glucose), making it an efficient substrate for biohydrogen production. Vinasse is produced as a result of bioethanol fermentation with molasses and is an ideal substrate for biohydrogen production (Arimi et al., 2015). Waste equal to 85.84 million tons of fresh fruit palm bunches is generated from palm oil industries and is also used as the substrate for biohydrogen production (Mohammadi et al., 2011; Rosa et al., 2020). Food processing wastewater, which is highly rich in carbohydrates and residual lignocellulose content, is also an excellent feedstock for the production of biohydrogen. Amorim et al., (2014) reported that the organic-rich substances in cassava are an ideal substrate for biohydrogen production (Amorim et al., 2014). Glycerol-rich wastewater obtained during the biodiesel production process could also be an ideal candidate substrate for biohydrogen production with a high H2 yield (Mahapatra et al., 2013). Distillery and dairy wastewater are used as a substrate to produce biohydrogen and the performance of biohydrogen production could be enhanced with the addition of nanoparticles, such as nickel and hematite into the fermentation culture (Gadhe et al., 2015). The wastewater from the textile industry during bleaching and washing processes contains both organic and inorganic substances, which could also be used for biohydrogen production (Lay et al., 2012). As discussed above, a variety of industrial wastewaters can be used for biohydrogen production with different H2-production activities. Table 1 summarizes the biohydrogen-producing performance obtained by using different waste substrates in terms of H2-production rate and H2 yield."
4,Biohydrogen production from organic wastes via fermentation,
5,Dark fermentation,"3.1 Dark fermentation Dark fermentation is a fermentative process, in which organic and inorganic substances are converted to biohydrogen by anaerobic bacteria in the absence of light. Dark fermentation is a promising technology since it is inexpensive, higher hydrogen production rate, and is easy to integrate with waste or wastewater treatment for large-scale biohydrogen production (Lay et al., 2012; Nagarajan et al., 2017). Organic and inorganic substrates rich in carbohydrates are also used for dark fermentation, producing various microbial products (such as hydrogen, volatile fatty acids, and alcohols) by the conversion of carbohydrates in dark fermentation (Show et al., 2012). The conversion of glucose into hydrogen is shown in Equations (1) , (2) , and (3) (Hallenbeck, 2012). (1) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6H 2 O → 6CO 2 + 12H 2 (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6H 2 O → 2CO 2 + 2CH 3 COOH + 4H 2 (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6H 2 O → 2CO 2 + CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 2H 2 Microbes, biochemical reactions, and reactor design are some of the main parameters of dark fermentation. In dark fermentation via glycolysis, anaerobic bacteria converted the substrate (i.e. carbon source and sugar) to pyruvate giving out key intermediates with the formation of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydride (NADH) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Then, pyruvate can be further converted into either: (1) acetyl-CoA with reduced ferredoxin (Fd) into the bio-organic products (e.g. ethanol, butanol and butanoic acid), (2) formate, or (3) reduced by two basic hydrogenases (i.e. [FeFe] –hydrogenase and [NiFe]-hydrogenase) into biohydrogen. Trace elements, such as zinc, iron, copper, are important for hydrogen production and the catalysis of hydrogenase (Keskin et al., 2019). Mu et al. (2020) studied bioH2 production from duck weed biomass via dark fermentation. Starch released during pretreatment of biomass was converted by bacterial species into hydrogen (Mu et al., 2020). Most of the studies based on dark fermentation infers the effectiveness of the process for hydrogen production. Fig. 2 illustrates the overview of the conversion of organic wastes into biohydrogen and high-value products."
6,Photo fermentation,"3.2 Photo fermentation Photo fermentation is a fermentative light-dependent process where the organic substrate is converted to hydrogen by photosynthetic bacteria (Hoàng et al., 2021). The production of hydrogen by photo fermentation is also called photo heterotrophic hydrogen production (Oh et al., 2013). Purple sulfur bacteria, purple non-sulfur bacteria, green sulfur bacteria are photosynthetic bacteria, which generate hydrogen by using light and organic waste. Purple non-sulfur bacteria are the widely used photosynthetic bacteria for photo fermentation (Brentner et al., 2010). Purple non-sulfur bacteria can convert organic acids into hydrogen. Eq. (4) expresses the conversion process. (4) C H 3 C O O H + 2 H 2 O → 4 H 2 O + 2 C O 2 Rhodobacter sphaeroides O.U001, Rhodobacter capsulatus, R. sphaeroides-RV, Rhodobacter sulfidophilus, Rhodopseudomonas palustris, and Rhodospirillum rubrum are some of the widely used purple non-sulfur (PNS) bacteria (Adessi & De Philippis, 2014). Nitrogenase and hydrogenase are the main components of purple non-sulfur bacteria. Under anaerobic conditions, nitrogenase is the leading enzyme responsible for the production of molecular hydrogen. Under anaerobic photosynthesis, light energy is used by purple non-sulfur bacteria to produce ATP and high-energy electrons to reduce ferredoxin and the reduced ferredoxin runs the protein reduction to hydrogen by ferredoxin. Photo fermentation can be done in both single-stage (photo fermentation alone) and two-stage photo fermentation bioprocesses (e.g. sequential dark and photo fermentation) to increase the overall hydrogen yield from sucrose (Chen et al., 2008a). Substrates, such as energy crops, organic solid wastes, and industrial wastewater (e.g. food industries, pulp and paper industry), were used for the photo fermentation process (Brentner et al., 2010). It has been reported that the optimum pH and optimum temperature for photo fermentation ranged from 6.8 to 7.5 and 31 to 36 °C, respectively (Argun & Kargi, 2011). The main advantage of photo fermentation is that it uses light energy to produce hydrogen and it can utilize the organic metabolites (e.g., organic acids) from dark fermentation effluent to generate hydrogen, thereby significantly increasing the overall biohydrogen yield and also effectively reducing the COD level in the dark fermentation effluent. However, photo fermentation has some limitations, which include poor light conversion efficiency and the requirement of hydrogen transparent impermeable bioreactors (Wang et al., 2021). The light conversion efficiency of photo fermentation ranged between 0.2% and 9.3%. A light efficiency of 10% for PNS bacteria corresponds to the theoretical maximum of photochemical efficiency (Bianchi et al., 2010; Gadhamshetty et al., 2010). Lactic and propionic acids, as well as other acids (e.g., acetic, butyric, and formic acids), are preferred substrates in photo-fermentation of effluent from a sugar plant. The inoculum used in the experiment was Rhodobacter sp. KKU-PS1 at a light intensity of 7500 lx. In a 1.7 L photobioreactor with an optimal pH of 7 and a temperature of 25.6 °C, 5.24 mL L-1h−1 of hydrogen was produced. With the identical processing parameters, 9.05 mL L-1h−1 of hydrogen was produced in the batch operation, showing that the batch method was better applied for current exploration (Assawamongkholsiri et al., 2018). As the photofermentation process is light dependant, understanding the effect of light intensity on bioconversion is critical. High intensity influences the microbial transfer time and metabolism whereas low intensity inevitably leads to low hydrogen yield. As a result, the researchers suggest that sustaining an ideal environment for photo-fermentative hydrogen production is vital to the performance. The basic scheme of dark and photo fermentative hydrogen production is represented in Fig. 3 . The biohydrogen production yield and rate from glucose by using different microorganisms, fermentation types, and operation modes are also compared in Table 2 . As shown in Table 2, dark fermentation gives a much higher production rate, while photofermentation attains a significantly higher hydrogen yield. Hence, appropriately integrating dark and photo fermentation may be able to achieve the best biohydrogen producing performance (Singh et al., 2021a, Singh et al., 2021b; Lee et al., 2021), which is one of the desired topics for the future development of biohydrogen production."
7,Thermophilic and mesophilic fermentation,"3.3 Thermophilic and mesophilic fermentation To produce biohydrogen, biomass can be used as a substrate, and microbes called thermophiles that are capable of thriving at high temperatures can be used to digest the biomass and produce hydrogen. The substrate needed for this operation could be microalgae, municipal and domestic bio-degradable wastes, cellulosic residues from food industries and paper industries, and wastewater obtained from food, dairy, brewing, and paper industries (Mamimin et al., 2016). This mode of fermentation has many perks because of its operation at higher temperatures. Some of the advantages of this mode are lower risk of contamination, better mixing and no agitation needed, higher reaction rates, and no cooling water needed (Zeldes et al., 2015). Apart from these, thermophiles have enzymes that also boost biohydrogen production as they can withstand higher temperatures (Rathinam et al., 2019). Some of the thermophiles used for biohydrogen production include Clostridium thermocellum (Cheng & Liu, 2011; Lin et al., 2017), Thermoanaerobacterium thermostercus (Romano et al., 2010), Clostridium thermolacticum (Valdez-Vazquez et al., 2015), Thermobrachium celere (Ciranna et al., 2011) and Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum (Zhang et al., 2019). Thermophilic fermentation has become one of the preferable options for biohydrogen production because in general, the industrial effluents are to be cooled down if hydrogen fermentation is operated under mesophilic conditions. However, by performing thermophilic fermentation, the hot industrial effluents could be directly treated and generate biohydrogen. High hydrogen production rate, pathogens elimination, and smaller diversity of end products are the other benefits of thermophilic fermentation. Dark fermentative hydrogen production can also be performed under mesophilic, thermophilic, and hyperthermophilic conditions (Kargi et al., 2012). However, the decrease in bacterial diversity at higher temperatures causes the instability of the bioprocess (Westerholm et al., 2018). To improve the hydrogen production from municipal solid waste, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Bacillus subtilis were used under the mesophilic processes (Okonkwo et al., 2020a). It was reported that temperature fluctuation maintained at 55 °C achieved H2 yields between 1.6% and 5% higher than when bioaugmentation was applied during the fluctuation (Okonkwo et al., 2020a). On the lab scale, the mesophilic condition is the most preferable option because it is easy to operate. In general, in mesophilic dark fermentation with microorganisms, the temperature was maintained within 25 °C to 40 °C, while the best outcome of hydrogen production was acquired at about 35 °C (Akhlaghi & Najafpour-Darzi, 2020). The most widely used mesophilic bacteria at the mesophilic temperature range are Clostridium, Enterobacter, and Bacillus, which are very active in this temperature range. The pretreatment of organic wastes is required to enhance hydrogen production. For the mesophilic condition, acid pre-treatment is mostly preferred because hydrogen-producing bacteria are more sensitive to alkali pretreatment (Wong et al., 2014), which could influence the growth of H2-producing bacteria and the substrate transformation during dark hydrogen fermentation. For the thermophilic biohydrogen-producing process, a 1 to 2% higher energy cost would be required when compared with the mesophilic process. However, the hydrogen yield obtained under mesophilic conditions is lower than that obtained under thermophilic conditions when using whey powder solution as the feedstock (Kargi et al., 2012). The reason for the lower yield with the mesotrophic dark fermentation could be due to the consumption of hydrogen by the bacteria under mesophilic conditions, which causes a decrease in the H2 yield. Therefore, thermophilic bacteria have higher hydrogen production, in which elevated temperatures enhance the conversion of substrates and mass transfer to be faster, resulting in higher hydrogen yields compared with mesophilic bacteria. This is most likely due to the elimination of hydrogen-consuming bacteria present in mesophilic fermentation at high temperatures, decreasing hydrogen yield and pace of synthesis. Yet, the volumetric hydrogen production rates are lower than those of mesophilic bacteria as a result of slower proliferation and lower cell densities (Łukajtis et al., 2018)."
8,Artificial photosynthesis,"Artificial photosynthesis is a biochemical process that mimics natural photosynthesis, wherein carbon dioxide and water are converted into carbohydrates and oxygen using sunlight or artificial light sources as the energy source (see Eqs. (5) and (6) ). On photocatalytic water splitting, the carbohydrate is converted into hydrogen molecules (Abas et al., 2020). This technique uses photosensitizers (PTS) to absorb the light spectrum. The photosensitizers used are mainly Ruthenium polypyridine complexes and their derivatives because they are efficient in absorbing light energy and they are also long-lasting (Deponti & Natali, 2016). Enzymes like hydrogenases are used to increase the rate of reaction. (5) 6CO 2 + 6H 2 O + light + PTS → O 2 + C 6 H 12 O 6 (6) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6H 2 O + light + PTS → 6CO 2 + 12H 2 Hydrogen production via artificial photosynthesis could have the potential to attain a higher H2 yield or higher light conversion efficiency when compared with dark and photofermentation with microorganisms. However, it is still in the early stage of development and there is a long way to go to reach the commercialization stage due to the need for more efficient technologies and a lower H2 production cost (Singh et al., 2021a, Singh et al., 2021b)."
9,Microorganisms involved in biohydrogen production,"The role of microbes is essential for hydrogen production. There are three main biological pathways by which hydrogen can be produced with the help of microbes, which include photolysis, photo-fermentation, and dark-fermentation (Bolatkhan et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019). The first pathway is bio photolysis, which requires carbon dioxide (CO2), water, and sunlight. These are supplied to photosynthesizing microbes like cyanobacteria and algae, which produce hydrogen and oxygen by using sunlight to split water during photosynthesis. Green algae contain Fe-Fe hydrogenase directs the development of biohydrogen. Similarly, in heterocyst cyanobacteria, nitrogenase is present which is reasonable for the same process. The downside with this method of hydrogen production is that the cells have to do a lot of metabolic work to produce hydrogen, so a large bioreactor is needed for minimal production. Also, this method cannot produce hydrogen from organic wastes. The next two methods rely on assimilating certain organic substrates (e.g., biomass), such as rice straw, corn, wood fibers, sugarcane, wheat, potato for fermentative hydrogen production. The biomass is refined and broken down into simple sugars at suitable temperature and pressure conditions, to feed the microbes. For dark fermentation performed in the absence of light, microbes like Clostridium sp. consume sugars from the treated biomass to produce hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and organic acids. Photo-fermentation uses photo-heterotrophs like purple bacteria that use solar energy to break down organic acids to form hydrogen and a few CO2. The microbes involved in phototrophic hydrogen production include algae, bacteria, and a few symbionts (Ban et al., 2018; Show et al., 2018). For the efficient production of hydrogen, necessary conditions must be provided like substrate, pH system, and temperature for the thriving of microbes. Enzymes used for hydrogen production can be either hydrogenases or nitrogenases (Gao et al., 2020; Mishra et al., 2019a; Yang et al., 2015). Calothrix sp. 336/3 is a wild-type cyanobacterial strain that can be used for hydrogen production (Kosourov et al., 2017). Scenedesmus obliquus is wild-type microalgae that were used as a feedstock to produce hydrogen by the method of photo-fermentation since the biomass of S. obliquus contains 10 to 34% of sugars by weight (Batista et al., 2014). Moreover, hydrogen can also be produced using S. obliquus by steam reforming and water–gas shift reaction (Arun et al., 2020). Chlorella vulgaris is another type of microalga that was used as a substrate to produce hydrogen mainly by dark fermentation (Wieczorek et al., 2014). Using dark-photo co-fermentation, in which the organic acids from the dark-fermentation process were directly fed into the reactors for photo-fermentation with the help of purple bacteria, algae, and cyanobacteria allows the production of a large amount of very pure bio-hydrogen to alongside a whole range of useful products. Also, purple bacteria require sufficient sunlight to convert organic acids into hydrogen, so the need for effective bioreactor increases. To overcome the problem with low light conversion efficiency, a dichroic mirror is used to reflect infrared light to purple bacteria, while the red light is reflected towards cyanobacteria and algae. This system proved to be effective in photo fermentative hydrogen production (Redwood et al., 2012). Autochthonous bacteria isolated from cellulosic biomass can form microbial interactions that allow for simultaneous hydrolysis and fermentation of substrates. Rabelo et al. (2018) optimized the hydrogen generation from sugarcane bagasse by allochthonous and autochthonous bacteria, attaining a maximal hydrogen production of 23.1 mmol H2 L-1 (Rabelo et al., 2018). In another study, a mixed photosynthetic bacterial consortium was employed for hydrogen production from corn stover by separate hydrolysis and photo-fermentation (SHP) and simultaneous saccharification and photo-fermentation (SSP) process (Wang et al., 2017). The results showed that SSP achieved a maximal hydrogen production rate of 83.87 mL H2/g corn stover, which was 27.8% higher than that of SHP. The dominant bacterial species for biohydrogen generation are Citrobacter, Clostridium, Enterobacter, and Bacillus species. Thus the choice of microorganisms for fermentative hydrogen production has a major impact as each type of microbes follow specific metabolic pathway."
10,Key parameters in hydrogen production,"Inoculum type has a major impact on the biohydrogen generation pathway. The kind of inoculum used for solid agroindustrial waste is critical since it assists the oxidation process, which is aided by microorganisms (Barca et al., 2015) Temperature and pH are the other two major variables impacting the bioconversion process as they affect microbial growth, which in turn influence hydrogen generation. H2 production from cassava pulp was investigated at various starting pH levels ranging from 5.0 to 8.0. Due to improved bacterial growth and relative polysaccharide degrading enzyme production, a pH of 7.0 was found to be the optimal environment for hydrogen generation, yielding 760 mL of H2/L (Pason et al., 2020). The activity of the hydrogenase enzyme is also controlled by alkaline and acidic environments. To enhance hydrogen production and avoid enzyme inhibition, pH must be maintained throughout the process (Pason et al., 2020). As for temperature, the mesophilic condition was identified to be optimum as most of the H2 consuming microorganisms are inactive at this temperature range (Pason et al., 2020) The nutrient content of the leftovers can also impact hydrogen generation. The C/N ratio is also important in the bioconversion of organic wastes. A low C/N ratio indicates that the microorganisms have insufficient carbon to complete the fermentation process, thereby producing a lower amount of the target metabolites (Yin & Wang, 2019). However, very few researchers have focussed on investigating the effect of the C/N ratio on H2 generation (Rabelo et al., 2018; Yin & Wang, 2019). A recent study on producing bioH2 from palm oil effluent showed a 28% increase in H2 production at a preferable C/N ratio of 140, while a higher C/N of 190 led to a decrease in H2 production owing to inadequate nitrogen content for H2 generation (Abdullah et al., 2020). Thus, a thorough understanding of the optimum parameters and efficient bioconversions of agro-industrial wastes into hydrogen is still required."
11,Biohydrogen purification,"According to ISO hydrogen fuel specifications, biohydrogen must have a minimum H2 purity of 99 percent to be used as a fuel source (Aasadnia et al., 2021; Azira & Aisah, 2019). Chemical absorption, membrane separation, cryogenic separation, and adsorption are all common techniques for biohydrogen purification (Sazali, 2020). Because biohydrogen is generated at low air pressure and temperatures ranging from 30 to 60 °C, chemical absorption is an appropriate purification approach (Azira & Aisah, 2019). which can be carried out at low pressure and temperature conditions. Although high purity biohydrogen may be obtained by chemical absorption, solvent costs and corrosion issues are some of the barriers to its use (Azira & Aisah, 2019). An alternative for chemical absorption is the cryogenic-based method which is an environmentally friendly process and happens at low temperatures. The crude gases are allowed to cool at low temperatures, through which pure liquefied hydrogen can be obtained. Low purity and high capital and operational costs limit its usage in small portable applications. Pressure swing adsorption has been proven to be an efficient method for biohydrogen purification and it contains multiple beds each consisting of distinct adsorbent layers. Membrane separation approach seems to be another potential industrial approach, which can compete and replace conventional technologies due to its numerous advantages. Relatively low operational, maintenance and capital costs, high adapting ability, simple operation, and compactness are few advantages of membrane-based hydrogen purification (Aasadnia et al., 2021)."
12,The role of nanotechnology in hydrogen production,"Nanomaterials are known to efficiently provide better bioprocess stability and to possess unique electrical, magnetic, and surface properties. It was also found that the addition of nanoparticles in the culture medium resulted in enhancing biological hydrogen production. The main role of nanoparticles in improving biohydrogen production could be due to enhancing the activity of the enzymes that are responsible for hydrogen production or increasing the intracellular electron transfer (Patel et al., 2018). Nanoparticles can also appreciably control the microbial metabolic movement for hydrogen generation (i.e. aerobic and anaerobic processes). Nanotechnology can be applied in hydrogen production in various ways. The role of nanotechnology in biohydrogen production can improve the enzymatic hydrolysis of substrates in which it can immobilize both substrates and enzymes during the conversion process. Furthermore, the incorporation of nanotechnology in dark fermentation has a higher specific site and catalytic activity by directly targeting the hydrogenase enzyme and increasing the electron transfer efficiency in anaerobic microorganisms for the higher biohydrogen production (Lin et al., 2016b). The key enzyme in biohydrogen production – hydrogenase plays an important role in the production of hydrogen under dark fermentation. It was found that the activity of hydrogenase can be enhanced by the nanoparticles. For instance, iron oxide (FeO) nanoparticles could increase the activity of hydrogenase (Kumar et al., 2019). Similarly, nickel nanoparticles could also improve the hydrogenase activity in dark fermentation to promote biohydrogen production (Bao et al., 2013). Han et al. (2011) have examined the mechanism of the effect of nanoparticles in biohydrogen production (Han et al., 2011) and showed that the nanoparticle will change the rate of electron transfer by entering into the bacterial cell through the cell wall. This leads to an increment in the surface area and quantum size of ferredoxin oxidoreductase and consequently enhances hydrogen production. Even though examples are showing that the addition of nanoparticles could improve hydrogen production, this enhancement always depends upon the concentration of the nanoparticles added and the type of H2-producing bacteria used. Using nanoparticles could also cause some problems, such as environmental stress, inhibition of the enzyme, or cell death if they are not used at an optimum level. In contrast, some nanoparticles by having contact with microorganisms showed antimicrobial activity, leading to some environmental issues. Nevertheless, the benefits of nanoparticles for microorganisms increase the efficiency in the movement of electrons toward the acceptors particularly during anaerobic climate conditions (Beckers et al., 2013). The use of nanotechnology is employed in the dark fermentation process for biological hydrogen production by using organic nanoparticles and photo-fermentation reactions by using inorganic nanoparticles (Pugazhendhi et al., 2019). Different nanoparticles employed in biohydrogen production and their corresponding performances are listed in Table 3 . Nanoparticles can also improve hydrogen production by stimulating photoelectron-chemical water splitting and photocatalytic water splitting (Mao et al., 2012). In the above-mentioned methods, there is a decent amount of hydrogen release. Firstly, the photo-electrochemical system has electrodes that are connected to nanoparticles, composed of metal oxides. The ability of nanoparticle-connected photoelectrodes can either absorb energy directly from sunlight or artificially irradiated from illumination light (e.g. LED or light bulb) to generate charge carriers. The electrodes then deliver these charges to water. Water molecules swipe electrons away to form hydrogen gas whereas holes strip the molecule of electrons to form oxygen gas. Semiconducting metal oxides like titanium dioxide (TiO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO) were modified structurally into nano-forms and used as/with electrodes (Acharyulu et al., 2020). Though TiO2 is stable and inexpensive, the major drawback is the large bandgap produced. This downside could be overcome by carbon doping or other modifications for the enhanced hydrogen production. Lanthanum iron oxide (LaFeO3) photoelectrodes could also be used for this purpose because they possess water-splitting ability due to the perfect band arrangements and they also have appreciable stability (Pawar & Tahir, 2018). The photocatalytic water splitting uses a nanoparticle-containing photocatalyst to efficiently decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen. Nanospheres of LaFeO3 along with reduced graphene oxide were used as photocatalysts for the production of hydrogen, because of their perfect nano-size and shape, stability, and integrity after water-splitting reactions, (Acharya et al., 2020). Niobates like lithium niobate have used a photocatalyst for hydrogen production because of their better activity (Zielińska et al., 2008). Generally, niobates and tantalates are efficient catalysts used for hydrogen production (Jana et al., 2016). In addition, elements like sulfur, boron, and phosphorous are nano-modified and used as photocatalysts. The released hydrogen must be stored for further use, for this to nanotechnology is employed where solid-state materials like carbon are modified to carbon nanotubes are used for hydrogen storage (Karthik Pandiyan & Prabaharan, 2020)."
13,Applications and future challenges,"Hydrogen is a clean and efficient source of fuel for vehicles. Fuel cell operation from biohydrogen can be a sustainable and environment-friendly method of electricity production because it does not require any high-energy input, such as high temperature used in the pyrolysis and gasification process (Rahman et al., 2016). However, the development of stable biohydrogen generation from renewable sources is requisite for commercial applications in fuel cells, since hydrogen is a clean energy carrier that possesses the highest potential to produce electricity using a fuel cell. Biohydrogen can also be combined with biogas as fuel to enhance the combustion process and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In addition, hydrogen is mainly used in the ammonia manufacturing process, as two-thirds of the world’s hydrogen production is utilized for the production of ammonia. Hydrogen is also utilized in refineries, where a series of chemical reactions take place, such as hydrocracking, hydrotreating, and desulphurization. Hence, the demand for hydrogen is kept on increasing. The next major industry that depends on hydrogen is the fertilizer industry for ammonia production as mentioned earlier. There are also other applications of hydrogen, including methanol production, metallurgy, glass industry, semiconductor industry, as well as fuel for space rockets (Okolie et al., 2021). Biohydrogen production from biomass resources is considered a feasible and environment-friendly energy source when compared to conventional fossil fuels. However, some challenges diminish the large-scale perspective of using hydrogen in the process. The accomplishment of maximum biohydrogen rate and yield is one of the primary challenges involved in the process. Hence, the industrial aspect of biohydrogen production from biomass sources has not been attained yet. Another challenge includes the requisite of the pretreatment process for some substrates, which sometimes result in low hydrogen productivity and high energy consumption due to the use of valuable chemicals in the pretreatment processes (Shao et al., 2020). Biohydrogen production performance is affected by operational mode, in addition to substrate, microorganisms used, and process conditions. Substrate and product inhibition also significantly affect hydrogen production since some volatile fatty acids and residual substrate interfere with microbial biohydrogen production (Wainaina et al., 2019). There are also some approaches to improve dark fermentative hydrogen production, including genetic manipulation and modification of bacterial strains to minimize by-products generation (Mishra et al., 2021); continuous product removal with substrate addition to eliminating the inhibition caused by the substrate and product accumulation (Wainaina et al., 2019); optimization of parameters and elimination of hydrogen consuming microbes in the culture by certain treatment methods (Wang & Yin, 2019). Although photo fermentative processes generate hydrogen with a high yield, the high requirement of input light energy makes the process unsuitable for industrial scale. New microbial strain development with improved light conversion ability and new technology development for better light distribution are future research prospects that need to be carried out for better hydrogen production through the photo fermentation pathway (Mishra et al., 2019b). Although the addition of nanoparticles into the fermentation medium is known to enhance biohydrogen yield, the stimulating effect of nanoparticles is highly dependent on microorganisms used and the dosage of nanoparticles, as an excessive nanoparticle concentration could result in high oxidative stress to the bacteria, leading to inhibition of the bacterial growth and hydrogen production. Further exploration in this regard should focus on the development and usage of microbial or biological nanoparticles in the fermentation process to avoid the toxicity caused by inorganic nanoparticles (Kumar et al., 2019). For commercial applications, biohydrogen production should be enhanced by optimizing the operational parameters and a suitable fermenter configuration and operation mode should be designed to achieve the best hydrogen productivity. Appropriate waste feedstock should also be selected for biohydrogen production to lower the H2 production cost, reduce the environmental wastes, and also achieve the goal of a circular economy. Additional factors should be addressed for better yield of biohydrogen production. Direct conversion of industrial wastewater into hydrogen would undermine the eventual objective of waste conversion into energy. Few microbial strains produce hydrogen gas along with other gases (Ueno et al., 2001). Easier separation of hydrogen from those microorganism cultures should be developed in upcoming researches. Furthermore, the integration of treatment techniques with organic feedstocks enhances the efficiency of bioenergy production (Rabelo et al., 2018). The biohydrogen yield can also be significantly elevated by properly integrating dark and photo fermentation, while the engineering issues and the optimization of conditions for each process still need to be intensively investigated (Singh et al., 2021a, Singh et al., 2021b; De Amorim et al., 2009; Mu et al., 2020). Finally, nanocatalysts can also be used to boost the production of biofuels, including hydrogen (Jayabalan et al., 2021)."
14,Conclusion,"Biohydrogen produced from organic wastes, achieved mainly through dark and photo fermentation, is clean and environmentally friendly. Pre-treated organic wastes could be converted to biohydrogen via dark fermentation at a high rate and low cost, while photo fermentation further utilizes organic acids from dark-fermentation effluent to produce hydrogen at a high yield. The biohydrogen production performance varies depending on the type of wastes used and the type of H2-producing microorganisms involved. Incorporating an appropriate type and concentration of nanoparticles into the fermentation process could improve biohydrogen production efficiency. Future exploration is requisite to enhance biohydrogen productivity on a commercial scale."
