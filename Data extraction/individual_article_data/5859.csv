0,Introduction,"The past century has contributed significant amounts of atmospheric, anthropogenic CO2 emissions from petroleum coal [1], natural gas [2] and biomass [3,4]. A large fraction of climate engineers and scientists and of the broader scientific community link these emissions to climate change [5,6]. This motivates CO2 storage [7,8], capture [9–12], reutilization [13], cryogenic removal [14] and conversion [15]. CO2 utilization, especially if driven by renewable energy, is an especially valuable climate change mitigation strategy [16,17]. CO2 hydrogenation to selective fuels, or modified Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (MFTS), represents one of the few markets that is large enough to absorb a measurable fraction of CO2 emissions [18–20]. MFTS, or any other CO2 utilization scheme, can only decrease net CO2 emissions if the energy for the process comes in large measure from carbon-free sources. MFTS using fossil fuel inputs will increase, not decrease, net CO2 concentrations. [21]. An MFTS process shares some characteristics with gas-to-liquids processing, including some aspects of the electrolytic and catalytic mechanisms [22]. Nevertheless, the rates and mechanisms of CO2 hydrogenation are not well known despite the essential role they play in feasibility studies and process design [23–25]. The hydrogenation reaction plays a key role in almost any CO2 reutilization process [26]. Moreover, it offers a good opportunity for sustainable development in the energy and environmental sectors [27]. Indeed, this reaction process not only reduces the increasing amount of CO2 in the atmosphere but it also results in production of valuable chemicals and fuels [28,29]. CO2 utilization as a chemical feedstock already occurs in a few processes, including urea synthesis and its derivatives, salicylic acid, and carbonates. CO2 thermodynamic stability presents high energy barriers to more widespread use, which necessitate employing electroreductive processes in order to convert CO2 to other chemical products [30]. These processes require a hydrogen source. Saeidi and his co-workers recently reviewed hydrogen production [31,32]. CO2 hydrogenation mainly produces methane, with small amounts of higher hydrocarbons, when processed over silica-supported Ni [33] and Ru catalysts [34], including implication for the industrial application of cobalt based FT synthesis [35] and the influence of varying CO/CO2 ratios over cobalt [36]. With increasing the amount of CO2, product composition altered from a common FT-type hydrocarbon distribution to almost entirely CH4 [37,38]. Cobalt catalysts ineffectively transform CO at moderate reaction temperatures [39] where the strong reversible CO adsorption is not present to promote the formation of long-chain hydrocarbons [40,41]. Fe possesses the most favorable characteristics for hydrogenation of CO2 to generate long-chain hydrocarbons [42]. Fe is a well-known catalyst in commercial FT synthesis, e.g. the ARGE catalyst [43]. Considerable work focues on promoting the effectiveness of Fe catalytic properties through using various support materials [44] or the incorporation of promoters, e.g., Mn [45] and Zn [46]. The most favorable Fe catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation gained by employing Al2O3 as the structural carrier [47]. Potassium promotes the reaction in concentrations of up to 0.5molK/mol of Fe [48]. Minett et al [49] reported the synthesis, characterization and catalytic study of iron nanoparticle (NP) –carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays grown on monoliths. These have been used for the catalytic conversion of carbon dioxide to hydrocarbons, showing superior properties compared to powder form. The residual iron NPs exhibited different catalytic performance outside and inside the CNTs [49]. Previous investigations have suggested that hydrogenation of CO2 begins through a two-step reaction mechanism [50]. In the first step, CO2 is transformed to CO in RWGS Eq. (1) [51]. (1) CO 2 + H 2 ↔ CO + H 2 O ∆ H 298 ℃ = + 41 . 2 kJ / mol The CO product then reacts via Fischer-Tropsch mechanisms to synthesize hydrocarbon products Eq. (2). (2) C O + 2 H 2 ↔ − ( CH 2 ) n − + H 2 O ∆ H 300 ℃ = − 166 kJ / mol The literature provides details of K-promoted Fe catalyst performance in terms of selectivity and catalyst activity with both H2/CO and H2/CO2 streams [52]. The transient behavior of CO/H2 and CO2/H2 are similar, including a sequence of kinetic regimes; however, different regimes with CO2 take a longer time. At steady-state conditions, the two gases produced similar product compositions, implying that synthesis of hydrocarbons products from CO2 improves with CO as the transient component. Fiato et al. [53] recently utilized laser-generated Fe carbide catalysts and suggested that the direct hydrogenation of CO2 contributes to hydrocarbon formation Eq. (3). This reaction is recommended to improve via dissociative adsorption of CO2 on the active catalyst phase by hydrogenation of the adsorbed carbon species. (3) CO 2 + 2 H 2 ↔ − ( CH 2 ) n − + 2 H 2 O ∆ H 300 ℃ = − 128 kJ / mol The literature also explores the kinetics of the CO2 shift reaction [54]. In comparison with the water gas shift [55] (reverse of CO2 shift reaction), the CO2 RWGS is a faster reaction over various types of oxide and metallic catalysts with a lower activation energy ( Table 1) [56]. The WGS, rSH1, commonly uses a kinetic rate equation as indicated in Eq. (4) [57]. (4) r SH 1 = k SH 1 p CO p H 2 O − ( p CO 2 p H 2 / K eq ) p CO + a S H 1 , H 2 O p H 2 O The equilibrium constant K eq maintains thermodynamic consistency as Eq. (5). (5) K eq = ( p CO 2 p H 2 p CO p H 2 O ) eq = 10 ( 0 . 0003855 T + 2180 . 6 T − 2 . 2 . 4198 ) where first two constants have units of K-1 and K, respectively and the expression is valid over the temperature range of 600–2000K [58]. The main complications of the MFTS kinetics are the complexity of the mechanism and the large number of species involved. This topic remains controversial despite 70 years of research history. The information obtained from the literature regarding elementary reactions occurring on the catalyst surface may contribute to the kinetic study [59]. CO2 hydrogenation in the MFTS process forms hydrocarbon chains by combining certain mechanistic steps [60]. The multi-compound product provides information about the phenomenon on the active site through its high compositional order. As there is not sufficient literature on the micro-mechanism of MFTS, this analysis assumes a Riedel-type expression similar to that reported for the CO shift reaction in the preceding work [57] as in Table 2. The current review is organized as follows: reaction mechanisms and catalytic effects on the enhancement of product efficiency for each RWGS and hydrocarbon synthesis reactions are presented in Sections 2 and 3. Section 4 provides the various FT synthesis mechanisms. Section 5 presents the previous derived kinetic rate and findings reported by Riedel and co-workers. Section 6 presents a new mechanism that considers some improvements and finally, conclusions are presented in Section 7. By taking the existing data into account the best reactor configuration which is adjustable to reaction mechanism is proposed."
1,CO2 conversion to CO via RWGS reaction,"The RWGS reaction involves CO2 and H2 as feed components [61]. The fundamental and practical significance of the RWGS reaction draw considerable attention to the RWGS catalyst design [62]. Investigations of the RWGS date back over two centuries. Much of this work is dedicated to the forward reaction, specifically to achieving equilibrium conditions at low temperatures. CO2 equilibrium hydrogenation, however, increases with increasing temperature, and the high-temperature applications of WGS more relavant to this process [63]. High-temperature WGS occurs over an Fe3O4-Cr2O3 catalyst at temperatures above about 350°C. At 400°C, the equilibrium constant ( p C O 2 p H 2 p CO p H 2 O ) is exceeds 10 but does not reach 1 until about 800°C [64]. This low equilibrium constant is a main obstacle in the accomplishment of RWGS reaction [65]. The equilibrium increasingly favors CO formation by (i) increasing CO2 concentration to favor complete H2 utilization (then recycling the excess CO2) [66], (ii) increasing H2 concentration to favor complete CO2 utilization (then recycling the excess H2) using Pd–Ag membrane to recover the hydrogen and (iii) reducing water vapor concentration using, for example, a perm-selective membrane. There have been several recent reports on employment of membrane in FTS reactors [67], where hydroxy sodalite (H-SOD) or zeolitic form a perm-selective membrane [68]. The same principle would be used to shift equilibrium in the RWGS reaction. RWGS reaction hydrogenates CO2 in reverse direction with most of the same catalyst behaviors as in the forward direction [69]. Some of the common catalysts include: (i) Copper-based catalysts, specially CuO/ZnO oxides modiﬁed by titania, zirconia, alumina and/or silica [70]. Cu–ZnO based catalysts typically include about 30% CuO, 33–60% ZnO, and the balance one of the moderators mentions. They can be pyrophoric and are considerably sensitive to poisons and sintering. For these reasons, they generally are employed at low temperatures. (ii) Iron-based catalysts modified from the commercial catalysts active in high temperatures that are dominantly (about 90%) Fe2O3 with the remainder Cr2O3. Iron-based catalytic materials operate at reaction temperatures higher than 400°C. These catalysts have substantially less sensitivity to Cl, alkali, and sulfur poisoning and to sintering. (iii) Cerium-based catalysts, although ceria or ceria-promoted formulations, are chiefly associated with precious metals (PGM), non-PGM ceria WGS catalysts have been proposed as well [71]. A non-pyrophoric Pt/CeO2 catalyst for medium to high temperature processes (300–400°C) was developed by NexTech Materials [72], but Johnson Matthey reported that contrary to superior initial activity in temperature range of 325–400°C, it deactivates when operated with both synthetic and real feedstocks [69]."
2,RWGS reaction mechanism,"2.1 RWGS reaction mechanism RWGS reaction mechanism remains unclear. The literature proposes two main reaction mechanisms as described in reaction mechanism section below [73]: (i) The redox mechanism envisions absorbed CO over reduced metals that reacts with an oxygen atom contributed from support to form CO2 [74]. Reduced support reoxizes by H2O, releasing hydrogen [75]. (ii) The formate mechanismpostulates a bidentate formate reaction intermediate produced throgh the CO reaction with terminal hydroxyl groups over the oxide support. This intermediate, decomposes to form H2 and a mono-dentate carbonate [76]. Extensive studies along with various characterization techniques have been performed to solve RWGS reaction mechanism. The redox pathway for RWGS reaction can be simply modeled by the following Eqs. (6) and (7): (6) CO2 + 2 Cu0 → Cu2O + CO (7) H2 + Cu2O → 2 Cu0 +H2O Although the Cu0 atoms detach CO2, the oxidation processes have to be slower than reduction of oxidized Cu catalyst [77]. H2, a reducing reagent; interacts directly with the intermediate formation during the RWGS reaction. According to formate decomposition, CO is derived from the association of H2 with CO2 [78]. Researchers have pursued many possible catalysts for RWGS both experimentally and theoretically [79]. Though Cu-based catalytic materials have been widely investigated, they are not extensively employed in methanol synthesis, primarily because of high-temperature sensitivity of Cu-based catalysts [80]. The mechanism of RWGS remains unsettled. The redox and the COOHX mechanisms are two recognized mechanisms. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for RWGS reaction over many Cu surfaces, have been performed by Wang et al. [81]. This study was carried out in order to analyze the redox pathway in which CO and O forms by CO2 decomposition before hydrogenation. The experimentally reported potential diagram has been well predicted by their calculations, where CO2 decomposition was the rate determining step (RDS). The trend of reduction in the energy barrier decreased in the order of Copper (111) > Copper (100) > Copper (110). As the geometries of transition state were found to be similar to the final state, actually the limiting factor was adsorption energy of the surface OX. Systematic calculations neglecting surface heat transfer effect proposed that among Iron (111) to Copper (111) surfaces, Cobalt (111) and Nickel (111) were the most active catalysts in RWGS via redox mechanism. Vesselli et al. [82] studied RWGS reactions occurred over Nickel (110), concluded that CO was formed from CO2 through Eley–Rideal mechanism, with COOHX as intermediate [82]. This COOHX mechanism is not the same as redox mechanism since CO2 decomposition happened after its first hydrogenation [80]. Various supported or free-standing cluster model catalysts were also analyzed. Using DFT calculations on molybdenum carbide it was indicated that similar to redox mechanism, adsorbed CO2 facilitated splitting to CO and OH species when reaching an H atom [83]. However, applying calculations on several different TiC supported metal catalysts showed that the main product CO was formed via COOHX mechanism [84]. CO formation on Al2O3 supported Ni 4 clusters also was via a COOHX intermediate and the development of surface hydroxyl could reduce the reaction barrier for RWGS reaction further, increasing the selectivity towards CO instead of methanol [80,85,86]. Chen et al. [87] considered the depletion energy of CO2, effective reaction sites, and the RWGS reaction pathway on copper nanoparticles. CO2 is bound by copper nanoparticles, as documented by two main peaks owing maxima at 353 K (α peak) and 525 K (β peak) in CO2-TPD (temperature-programmed desorption of CO2) spectra. In RWGS reaction, β-type CO2 predominates. An infrared band at 2007cm-1 appointed to the adsorbed CO on low-index copper facets and posited reaction paths chiefly comprise the constitution of the formates [88]. Pd- and Pt-based catalysts proceed via different mechanisms. IR spectra revealed the constitution of carbonate, formate, and CO through utilizing Pd/Al2O3 catalysts and a supercritical mixture of CO2 and H2 [89,90]. The comparison reveals that Pd assists in dissociative adsorption of H2 and constitution of formate and CO, although they were only accepted over the exempt alumina support. Using operand transient reactivity along with spectroscopic analysis, Meunier et al. [91] recently revealed that formates are principally spectator species on a 2wt% Pt/CeO2 catalyst at 433K while probably the main reaction intermediates at 493K. Fig. 1 illustrates another possible mechanism with a Pt/Al2O3 based on in situ attenuated total reﬂection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IRS) results [92]. CO2 and H2 react at the Pt-Al2O3 interface while at boundary sites CO employed as the probe molecule . Carbonate-like species formed through adsorption of CO2 on oxygen defects of alumina thin films while CO produced via CO2 reaction with hydrogen. Goguet et al. [93] expanded on a precise spectro-kinetic study observed by diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFT) and mass spectrometry (MS) using steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) to recognize the surface species on a Pt/CeO2 catalyst dynamically [94,95]. Fig. 2 illustrates a reaction model comprising three types of mechanism; the CO formation from formate, the formate and Pt-bound carbonyls species, and the RWGS reaction continues through surface carbonate intermediate products, comprising reaction between surface carbonate species and oxygen defects or diffusion of vacancies in ceria [93]. Theoretical models could clarify the character of molecular interactions. Qin et al. [96] examined RWGS over an Ni surface through DFT calculations and also anticipated that the disruption of C–O bond in CO2 took place before cleavage of H2. H2 could increase charge transfer for the incorporation of Nickel and also help the decomposition of coordinated CO2 molecules through decreasing the energy barrier [97]. The RDS of reaction is formation of water through hydrogen shift from Nickel sites to oxygen atoms. Liu et al. [98] reported the reaction pathway modeling for the RWGS reaction employing ﬁrst row transition metal catalytic materials ĹX (Ĺ = C3N2H5-; X = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Cobalt, Ni, Cu, Zn). Coordination of a CO2 molecule (ĹX (CO2)) is the main step of the reaction. The second step is the disruption of a C–O bond of ĹX (CO2) to produce ĹX (CO) and ĹX (O) by adding ĹX, followed by hydrogenation of oxo complex ĹX (O) to form ĹX (H2O). The last step involves desorption of H2O and CO. Fig. 3 illustrates reaction enthalpies [98]. Coordination and CO2 reduction are key discriminating characteristics for the catalytic cycle of the RWGS reaction. Although light metals have thermodynamic advantages in these steps, heavy metals more effectively hydrogenate the oxo complex [88]."
3,Effect of catalyst types on RWGS reaction,"2.2 Effect of catalyst types on RWGS reaction Catalysts used in WGS reaction find application in reverse reaction as well [69], including copper-based catalysts [99]. Liu and his colleagues produced bimetallic Cu–Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation. Ni and copper produce CH4 and CO, respectively, and their ratio (Cu/Ni) affects selectivity and conversion [100]. Cu–Zn/Al2O3 and Cu/ZnO catalyze WGS and methanol synthesis reactions and have been investigated for RWGS [101]. Cu-rich (Cu/Zn > 3) catalysts supported on alumina exhibit the highest reactivity, with a linear relationship between the catalyst activity and the copper surface area [101]. Additionally, Chen et al. [78] have confirmed that Cu/SiO2 is more active with a potassium promoter (12.8% CO2 conversion at 600°C) with respect to a promoter-free catalyst (5.3% CO2 conversion at 600°C). Newly developed active centers at the interface of Cu and K promote formate generation (HCOO) [102]. The main functions of K2O are to create active sites for formate decomposition and promote CO2 adsorption [103]. Potassium also increases selectivity to low-weight olefins (C2–C4) [104,105]. Moreover, for FT synthesis, the long chain hydrocarbon selectivity was increased through diffusion-enhanced α-olefin re-adsorption phenomena. Despite the several researches reporting the advantages of the hierarchical porous material, its application as supported copper catalyst for methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation has not yet been investigated [106]. According to Zuhairi Abdullah and his co-worker [107], for glycerol to monoglycerides conversion, the superiority of mesostructure catalysts in comparison with microporous catalysts has been elucidated in terms of accessibility to active sites, thermal stability, pore diffusion. RWGS increases CO formation with increasing temperature. Inappropriate thermal stability (e.g., sintering of copper nano-particles) improves when using a thermal stabilizer. For instance, the catalytic activity and stability of Cu/SiO2 at elevated temperature may be efficientally enhanced with a small amount of Fe, with good stability up to 120h at 600°C at atmospheric pressure while 10wt% iron-free Cu/SiO2 catalyst lose its activity quickly [108]. Fe effectively prohibits Cu sintering but other species may improve catalytic activity [108]. Chen et al. [108] demonstrated improved thermal stability using Cu/SiO2 catalyst formed by atomic layer epitaxy (ALE). The ALE–Cu/SiO2 catalysts produced catalytic activity for RWGS by trapping CO with small Cu particles. Ce catalyzes both RWGS and WGS reactions [109]. In RWGS, Ni/CeO2 (2wt% Ni) displays high selectivity, activity and stability. The CO yield at 600°C is ~ 35% in a 9h process. Lattice oxygen vacancies of ceria and extremely scattered Nickel play important roles, whereas bulk Nickel favors methane formation [110]. However, ceria-supported catalysts deactivate rapidly under many conditions. The deactivation decreases dramatically with a thin layer of deposited carbon on CeO2 support. This indicates that a small fraction of the support participates in the reaction and that this fraction may be located next to the supported metal [111]. Noble metals such as Rh, Pt, and Ru exhibit high activity for H2 dissociation have been used for CO2 hydrogenation. Bando et al. [112] carried out CO2 hydrogenation on Li-promoted Rh ion-exchanged zeolites (Li/RhY). CH4 formation shifts to CO with increasing Li content. At Li/Rh ratios of grater than ten, CO is the principal product (87% selectivity) and CH4 formation becomes a minor product (8.4% selectivity). The existence of Li on the surface leads to the formation of new active centers which improve CO2 adsorption and stabilize adsorbed CO [112]. Catalytic reactivity depends on the metal precursors. Kusama et al. [113] developed silica-supported Rh catalysts (Rh/SiO2) for CO2 hydrogenation using nitrate, acetate and chloride impregnation. The catalysts synthesized from acetate and nitrate produced primarily CO2 while the chloride precursor produced larger amounts of CH4. Detailed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements indicated the influence of precursor on CO2 hydrogenation activity. The hydroxyl to Rh atoms ratio on the SiO2 surface determines reactivity, where a high ratio promotes CO production. This ratio follows the sequence: chloride < nitrate < acetate [113]."
4,CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons via MFTS,"CO2 hydrogenates to hydrocarbons both directly and indirectly, that is, via synthesis gas and/or methanol production as intermediate [114]. Indirect routes include a multi-stage approach using separate reactors and a single-reactor- approach using hybrid catalysts to perform the multi-step transformation [115]. The well-known CO2 hydrogenation to methane (Sabatier reaction) [116,117] suffers from several disadvantages, including the relatively low value of CH4, larger H2 consumption, less energy per unit volume and more troublous storage [118]. Generally, hydrocarbons fuel production from CO2 requires more resources (energy, H2, capital equipment, etc.) than alternative means of producing fuels. In particular, it will always require more energy to make any hydrocarbon from CO2 and H2O than can be derived from converting the hydrocarbon back to CO2 and H2O. That is, converting CO2 and H2O into fuel and then using the fuel in a combustion heat engine is an energy sink, not an energy source. In practical terms, it is a large energy sink. However, other motivations/incentives may justify this process [69]. These broadly include: 1. Opportunities to use excess H2 that would otherwise be wasted rather than using water, such as H2 generated in some proposed high-temperature nuclear reactor systems, 2. Using renewable or ubiquitous waste energy as the energy source for the process, such as driving the process with geothermal, solar or wind energy that would otherwise be wasted, 3. Economic or regulatory conditions that override the energy issues, such as producing fuels with cheap or negative-valued energy during low energy demand and using the fuel during peak demand, when energy costs are higher, 4. Environmental or safety concerns that override the energy issues, such as converting CO2 from production sources to a more easily transported or used liquid to remove it from confined spaces or asphyxiation hazards. Only a small fraction of the current global CO2 production will likely find use in these applications, but that fraction is probably not zero. Light alkanes can form from CO2 in a modified version of FTS process. The modification involves CO2 rather than CO as a feedstock and modified catalyst composition tuned to enhance the light alkanes formation. These alkanes might become LPG or petrochemical feedstocks [119]. The relative competition between CO and CO2 affects the conversion [120]. The conversion of CO/H2, CO2/H2 and (CO+CO2) /H2 mixture employing cobalt catalysts at typical FT conditions favors CO conversion, as reported by Zhang et al. [121]. The found similar catalytic activities but different selectivity as they fed CO or CO2. Selectivity is measured by an α parameter in the Anderson–Schulz–Flory (ASF) distribution. The α factor represents the probability that a CO/CO2 atom molecule will react to extend the hydrocarbon chain and commonly is around 0.8 for traditional FTS. In contrast, the CO2 hydrogenation products contain about 70% or more of methane ( Fig. 4) [122]. CO2 and CO hydrogenation appear to follow similar reaction pathways at a similar H2/C ratios, though the pathway for both varies with feed composition and reactor conditions. There are also differences in durability of catalysts; The rate of catalyst deactivation is more while feeding CO compared to CO2 even though H2O/H2 ratio is at least twofold for CO2 conversion [69]. In contrast to the results over a cobalt catalyst, an Fe-Al2O3-Cu-K catalyst produces approximately similar hydrocarbon using either CO2 or CO during hydrogenation [123]. The CO and Fe mechanisms differ in methane inhibition and product depletion as a required condition for chain growth [123]. Although carbide and alkali irreversibly cover the Fe surface, CO absorption is reversible. γ-Al2O3 provided the best support with iron in terms of active sites while potassium was an excellent promoter [123]. Finally, the active iron catalyst phases form in situ (iron carbide–Fe5C2 formation), unlike cobalt [124]. It was perceived that the lattice parameters of iron and cobalt carbides alter with feed composition [125,126]. These parameters remain unchanged with CO/H2 ratio but reduce with CO2/H2 ratio. Moreover, CO/H2 reaction takes place without a primary reduction step unlike the CO2/H2 reaction, where the first step is reduction of CO2 to CO. Consequently, the efficient reactions for CO/H2 and CO2/H2 FT reactions differ, even when using similar catalytic material. Cobalt-based catalysts generate large quantities of methane, whereas Fe-based catalysts produce less methane and more alkane [69,127]. Incorporation of the iron-based FT catalyst in zeolites maximizes the isoalkanes formation [128]. Bai et al. [129] considered the synthesis of isoalkanes from CO2 hydrogenation over Fe-Zn-Zr/HY catalysts. In addition, Ni et al. [130] proposed the same catalysts, indicating iso-butane produced via methanol to gasoline reaction while iso-pentane forms from dimerization of C2 and C3 [69]. CO2 and H2 can react over Cu–Zn-based catalysts to form methanol, which afterwards converts to other hydrocarbons such as gasoline [131]. This method commonly results to the production of light alkanes as principal products due to alkenes (unsaturated hydrocarbons) hydrogenation [132]. In non-methanol-mediated process, CO2 hydrogenation occurs through RWGS reaction and FT synthesis [133]. Cobalt is the most utilized catalysts in FTS because of its high efficiency. As discussed, cobalt accomplishes more as a methanation catalyst rather than a hydrocarbon/FT catalyst as the feed CO2 content increases [134]. Mixed Fe/Cobalt catalysts have also showed low selectivity towards desired products [125]. Akin et al. [135] reported 70mol% CH4 as the product of CO2 hydrogenation over Cobalt/Al2O3 catalyst. They proposed that the conversion of CO and CO2 takes place through various reaction routes: the former produces chiefly C–H and O–H surface species while the latter produces H–C–O and O–H surface species [136]. Typical ASF product distributions for the selectivity of hydrocarbons in both CO and CO2 hydrogenation is depicted in Fig. 4 [137]. Obviously, hydrogenation of CO2 does not lead to a ASF distribution similar to traditional FTS using CO and H2. CO2 hydrogenation produces a low C/H ratio because of slow CO2 adsorption rates on the surface due to the thermodynamically and chemicaly stable CO2. The hydrogenation of surface-adsorbed intermediates favors methane formation with a decline in chain growth [88]. Ding et al. [138] investigated the effects of surface hydroxyl groups and SiO2 content of alumina supports for FeK/Al2O3 catalysts and their selectivity and activity for CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons. Surface acidic–basic hydroxyl distribution of the supports were measured by Fourier transform infrared and point of zero charge (PZC). The PZC of Al2O3 supports strongly affects the dispersion as well as particle size of the Fe-based catalysts. The PZC value of Al2O3 increases as the iron dispersion increases and particle size decreases. A PZC near 8 produced the highest CO2 conversion (54.4%) and C5 + hydrocarbon selectivity (31.1%) , with a linear relationship between PZC and CO2 conversion and the long-chain products selectivity. Moreover, SiO2-doping of alumina strongly affected the surface acidic–basic hydroxyls distribution of the supports, while an optimal SiO2 content enhanced the catalyst activity by adjusting CO adsorption and the reduction pattern of the iron-based catalysts [138]."
5,Reaction mechanism,"3.1 Reaction mechanism This section presents the MFT mechanism to describe hydrocarbon synthesis in more detail. The discussion includes the catalyst deactivation mechanism at different stages of the hydrogenation reaction. This identifies the reasons for deactivation and, consequently, possible catalyst deactivation mitigation strategies. 3.1.1 Modified Fischer-Tropsch mechanism Lee et al. [139] proposed a reaction mechanism for hydrogenation of CO2 to a hydrocarbon. CO2 is reduced by iron (II) followed by H radical abstraction by the species adsorbed on the catalyst surface ( Fig. 5). The residual H reacts with the carbonyl C to form OH, formic acid and CO. Fe-CH2 radical forms by in a similar manner as a carbon-carbon propagation species. Chain propagation represents the main reaction pathway since higher hydrocarbons are the main products. Higher α-olefin selectivity to paraffins is attributable to less H2 uptake and no excess H2 in this reaction system; therefore, the hydrogen dosing during the reaction is critical. 3.1.2 Catalyst deactivation mechanism Riedel et al. [140] divides hydrocarbon synthesis over iron oxides in steady state condition to five episodes of distinguished kinetic models as illustrated in Fig. 6. In episode I, adsorption of reactants over the surface of catalyst initially carbonize catalyst. In episodes II and III, during the steady carbon deposition, products of RWGS reaction prevails. In episode IV, activity of FT expands up to steady state and controls the situation in episode V. Reduced catalyst mainly consists of iron phases such as α-Fe and Fe3O4. Fe3O4 and Fe2O3. These phases decrease with time, replaced by a new amorphous iron phase that seems to be active in RWGS reaction. FT reaction starts with generation of iron carbide (Fe5C2) due to the reaction between iron and carbon released from CO decomposition. Iron-based catalysts considerably lose their activity during RWGS reaction due to water formation which can lead to catalyst poisoning from carbon deposit [88]. It is crucial to remove water in situ [141]. For instance, deactivation take place over Fe–K/γ-Al2O3 in a fixed bed reactor though the long-run activity is higher than 35% during the reaction [91]. It can be mitigated up to 12% with employing a membrane reactor. Stable but nonactive carbide (Fe3C) is responsible for catalyst deactivation, which is formed by Fe5C2 carburization [142]. In addition, Lee et al. [142] explored H2/CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbon to investigate the deactivation route of Fe–K/γ-Al2O3 catalyst using XPS, HR-TEM, TPO, and Mossbauer spectroscopy which illustrated in Fig. 7. The iron-based catalysts deactivated considerably in CO2 hydrogenation process via catalyst poisoning and carbon deposition. The deactivated catalyst analyzes provided knowledge on deactivation route as a function of time and catalyst position. The deactivation route differed with reactor position. As time progressed, hematite (Fe3O4) generated after H2 reduction and was then gradually carbonized to χ-Fe5C3. Eventually, the χ -Fe5C3 phase was changed to χ -Fe3C, which is not an active species for CO2 hydrogenation. The main deactivation pathway in the inlet reactor region was phase transformation while the principal parameter at the reactor outlet region was coke deposits generated by secondary reactions. Ahn et al. [143] synthesized two kinds of Co3O4 catalysts by precipitation methods using nano-replicating technique to clarify mesoporosity effects of a Co3O4 catalysts. The mesoporous Co3O4 indicated a proper initial activity with high mass-transfer rates of heavier FT products. These catalysts deactivated though changes in porosity and morphology due to coke deposition [143]. Bae et al. [144] determined the thermal stability and catalytic activity of zirconium phosphate (ZrP) supported Ru/Cobalt/ZrP/SiO2 as a promoter during FTS. ZrP supported on SiO2 with phosphorous prevents cobalt particle aggregation and improves catalyst stability due to surface modifications. The thermal stability of these catalyst arises from to the spatial confinement of cobalt particles [144]."
6,Fischer-Tropsch synthesis mechanism,"The RWGS to hydrocarbons involves a CO2 hydrogenation step followed by FTS. Thus, the Fischer-Tropsch mechanism plays a vital role. Prior research demonstrates that the FTS is a step wise chain growth polymerization reaction [145]. The FTS mechanism first converts the feed to an initiator and monomer, then polymerizes the monomers to form hydrocarbons [146]. This differs from many other polymerization mechanisms. The formation of initiator and monomer plays an important role in this mechanism [147]. One proposed mechanism type involves a single method for monomer and initiator formation. The new mechanism proposed in this document considers two methods for initiation and propagation. These two aforementioned mechanism types are discussed as follows:"
7,Formation chemistry of monomer and initiator,"4.1 Formation chemistry of monomer and initiator Over the decades, the FTS mechanisms have been the subject of a large number of research studies. Although different models have been proposed to explain FTS, most researchers use either power law expressions or the kinetics of Langmuir–Hinshelwood–Hougen–Watson (LHHW) to describe the FTS mechanism [148]. Reactants H2 and CO adsorb and at least partially dissociate on the active sites of FT catalysts. Catalyst type and operating conditions are key factors that determines the amount of dissociation. CO adsorbs more thoroughly than H2. The adsorbed and partially dissociated H2 and CO produce the hydrocarbons through reactions [149]. The details of the polymerization steps distinguish the various reaction mechanism. In general, the polymerization steps include initiation, propagations, and termination, as discussed below. Initiation generates the initial chain monomer from the adsorbed reactants on active sites of catalyst. Propagation adds monomers to the growing chains. Termination desorbs the growing chain from the catalyst active site [150]. Table 3 summarizes some details of several initiation reactions mechanisms. As indicated, the remaining kinetics and mechanisms depend on this initiation step. The following discussion focues on these mechanisms [151]. 4.1.1 Enolic mechanism The enolic mechanism postulates that the surface species forms throgh hydrogenation of chemisorbed CO. Condensation reactions between enolic species and water elimination leads to chain growth. A CHROH surface species produces branched hydrocarbons [152,153]. A plausible enolic mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 8 [154]. As tabulated in Table 3, X=CHOH initiates this reaction and acts as a monomer. Previous investigations of iron catalysts showed that the FT reaction can be initiated from alcohols and aldehydes [155] but they are not proper initiators for cobalt catalysts [156]. Although alcohols can initiate the reaction, Tau et al. [157] indicate that alcohols cannot propagate the reaction. 4.1.2 CO insertion mechanism CO insertion, like initiation, involves an oxygen containing intermediate. In this insertion reaction, the X=CO (CO adsorbed on an active site) and a surface methyl species represent the monomer and the chain initiator, respectively. Fig. 9 illustrates the CO insertion mechanism. CO-insertion in the metal alkyl bond forms a surface acyl species leading to chain growth [158]. Oxygen removal from the surface species generates enlarged alkyl species. Chain termination occurs like the alkyl mechanism. Oxygenated compounds lead to chain termination or to aldehyde and alcohol formation [154,159]. As Table 3 shows, X=CO acts as a monomer, analogous to the mechanism of hydroformylation [160]. Experimental limitations prevent definitive validation of this mechanism over heterogeneous catalyst [161]. Therefore, the X-CO mechanism remains postulated rather than demonstrated. 4.1.3 Mechanism of formate As Table 3 indicates, the formate mechanism involves gas-phase CO [162] as a monomer through insertion into an O-H (O-R) bond of a surface hydroxyl (alkoxy) group to form COOH (COOR). CO partial pressure in the gas phase and chain length distribution over catalyst active sites are dependent to each other [163], consistent with the role of gas-phase CO as a chain-insertion monomer. Frennet and Hubert [164] investigated the primary steps in reaction, the probability of chain growth ( α ASF ) is related to P CO and is not related to the surface coverage of carbon ( θ C ). Therefore, surface carbon does not perform as a monomer gas phase CO does on the cobalt-Cu catalyst. Schweicher and his colleagues confirmed similar behavior for the Cobalt/MgO catalyst [163]. However, the Cobalt/SiO2 did not exhibit similar behavior [160]. Ni, Ni/SiO2, Ni/TiO2 and Ni/Al2O3 produced similar results [160]. Thus, the support plays a large role in determining the extent to which CO acts as a monomer in this reaction. The formate mechanism considers only gas-phase CO as the monomer and would predict similar results regardless of the details of the support. Therefore, the formate mechanism does not sufficiently capture all of the observations. Furthermore, data demonstrate that CHx also acts as a monomer in FTS [165], as considered in subsequent part. 4.1.4 Mechanism of carbide According to Fig. 10, CH2 is introduced as a monomer in the carbide mechanism. According to the literature, Fischer and Tropsch [166] assumed that reaction of CO with active metals could lead to the formation of carbides as intermediates in FTS. Carbide then reduces to a CH2 species as a monomer. There is good evidence that a carbide mechanism is involved in FTS. Various transient metals decompose CO to generate metal carbides, although some metals (Ag, Au, Cu, Ir, Pd and Pt) cannot decompose it quickly due to being almost non-active in the FTS. Besides, metals which can fulfill it easily and generate excessively durable oxides (and carbides) are non-active in the FTS [167]. Two species of carbon mainly exist over catalyst surface -high-temperature graphitic bulk carbon and low-temperature carbidic surface- which demonstrates that both are active toward hydrogenation [168]. Though, low-temperature surface carbide is active in hydrogenation, it is proved that CH2 is not able to be self-polymerized, thus the existence of an initiator is essential [169]. Consequently, the modification of the carbide mechanism recognized as a mechanism of alkyl. 4.1.4.1 Mechanism of alkyl The mechanism of alkyl is a probable route for chain growth in FTS. Chain initiation happens through dissociative CO-chemisorption, when surface carbon and surface oxygen are formed. Surface oxygen reacts with adsorbed hydrogen, yielding water, or with adsorbed CO, yielding CO2. While surface C is later hydrogenated, results in a successive reaction between CH, CH2, and CH3 surface species. The CH2 and CH3 surface species form the monomer and the chain initiator in the mentioned reaction scheme, respectively. Chain growth occurs through consecutive insertion of the CH2 surface species. Product generate via either β-hydride elimination yielding α- olefins or via hydrogen addition yielding n-paraffins [170,171]. This alkyl mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 11 [154]. Oxygenates and branched hydrocarbons do not form in this alkyl reaction mechanism [172], and their formation calls for an extension of this mechanism. The alternate pathway involves reaction of alkylidene and a methyl surface species like the alkyl mechanism. The alkylidene surface species originates from a reaction between alkyl species and methylidyne species. The branched alkyl species undergoes desorption reactions such as those suggested for n-alkyl species. Experimental observations propose the presence of branched hydrocarbons in small fractions, generated from re-adsorbed olefins, such as propene. In addition, experiments indicate more branched hydrocarbons than expected because of the reincorporation of re-adsorbed olefins [171]. Alternatively, surface hydroxyl groups may account the formation of oxygenates. The coupling of a surface hydroxyl group and an alkyl group may result in generation of alcohols [154,173]. The most admitted reaction route is alkyl mechanism for alkanes and alkenes [155]. According to Table 3, the alkyl mechanisms (CH2 and CH3 (alkyl)) introduces the monomer and initiator [169]. In an inert gas, ethylene forms as the primary product of CH2 since it cannot polymerize to heavier hydrocarbons solely. However, in the vicinity of H2, CH2 groups form hydrocarbons. According to these researchers, metal hydride and alkyl groups starts the chain growth. Further analysis shows that an alkyl mechanism explains the FTS mechanism. Barneveld and Ponec [174] completely agree with Vannice [175], who proposed C 2 + activity for syngas was in the subsequent arrangement for active metals: Iron > Cobalt > Rhodium > Nickel > Palladium = 0 Although this sequence followed for CH2 and CH, CH activity differs from CH2 and none of them follow the synthesis gas. This achievement demonstrates that mechanism of FT reaction is more complicated than the suggested alkyl mechanism. Therefore, so many complex mechanisms have been developed recently i.e, alkenyl and alkylidene-hydride-methylidyne as follows: 4.1.4.2 Mechanism of alkenyl According to the Table 3, the surface methylene species have been considered as monomer in the alkenyl mechanism [176]. Reaction initiation would be occurred by formation of a surface vinyl species (–CH=CH2) [177], generated through the reaction of surface methylene and methyne species. Chain growth develops through reaction between vinyl [178] species and monomer unit (=CH2) to form an allyl specie (–CH2CH=CH2). Isomerization of the allyl species leads to the generation of an alkenyl specie (–CH=CHCH3), that may undergo further reaction [179]. Chain termination results through reaction between surface hydrogen and surface alkenyl species producing α-olefins [180]. This mechanism is depicted and tabulated in Fig. 12 and Table 3 respectively [154]. For the frist time Maitlis et al. [176] proposed the alkenyl mechanism. It was detected that Fe, Cobalt, Ru, and Rh supported on silica produced identical hydrocarbon distributions with 1-alkenes as the main hydrocarbon. It is concluded that alkanes would be produced from alkenes as secondary products. Furthermore, after ethene- C 2 13 addition to syngas, the 1-alkene hydrocarbons would be produced. They offered that the step of initiation can be occurred through C2 surface species of a vinyl type (-CH=CH2) based on their observations. Step of initiation was experimentally approved based on alkenyl mechanism but in the step of propagation and termination could not be approved by this mechanism due to experimental data limitation [160]. the presence of branched methyl [160] and also alkanes [181] in the product cannot be easily interpreted based on alkenyl mechanism. Rhodes et al. [182] approved that the nature of the C1 species is responsible for initiation and propagation of hydrocarbon chain in the dehalogenative oligomerization of multiply-halogenated methanes. It is reasonable to suggest that dissociative adsorption of CH2Cl2 and CHCl3 on metal surfaces leads in generation of CH2 and CH species, respectively [182]. Therefore, reaction of CH2Cl2+H2, CHCl3+H2, and CH2Cl2+ CHCl3+H2 mixtures catalyzed by Pt-Cobalt/C was explored in an attempt to distinguish between the so-called “alkyl” [169,171] and “alkenyl” [172] mechanisms of hydrocarbon generation from multiply-halogenated methanes under conditions of halocarbon hydrodehalogenation. Catalyst selection was performed as a result of its high oligomerization selectivity in CF2Cl2+ H2 reaction [183]. 4.1.4.3 Mechanism of alkylidene-hydride-methylidyne As tabulated in Table 3, the alkylidene-hydride-methylidyne mechanism, CH+H rather than CH2 is assumed as the monomer. It has been proposed by Ciobicǎ et al. [184], in this pathway would not proceed through alkenyl isomerization step justifying the alkanes and alkenes as primary products as well. Lately, Maitlis and Zanotti [185] selected this mechanism as preferable one for chain propagation. But, the D tracing examination [165] illustrated that propagation must occur by CH+H instead of CH2. Pursuant to this pathway, methyl branched hydrocarbons should be synthesized while it is not the option for ethyl or dimethyl branched hydrocarbons that meet the experimental results [165]. Apparently the alkylidene-hydride-methylidyne pathway is so far the most discussed common mechanism to describe FTS mechanism. Although the alkylidene-hydride-methylidyne pathway is able to justify initiation, chain growth and termination for the FTS mechanism, considers that CO dissociation is direct contrary to precious investigations that illustrated it is non-direct and must be H-assisted as explained in the Section 4.2.2."
8,FTS mechanism,"4.2 FTS mechanism According to previous study, the FTS mechanism consists two routes (two kinds of intermediates cause to synthesize the hydrocarbons) [186]; According to SSITKA, there are two routes for FTS mechanism [187]. Ni [188], Ru [189], Rh [190], Co [191] and Fe [192] have been proved toward production of methane and higher hydrocarbons [193]. Thus, there seems to be two similar reaction mechanism routes in FTS for the above mentioned active metals. The two mechanisms such as the CO carbide-insertion and the H-assisted CO decomposition. 4.2.1 Mechanism of CO insertion-carbide In the proposed mechanism by Gaube and Klein [194], the CO insertion and alkyl routes take place at the same time as main assumption. The proposal of this mechanism resulted from the notable meet of two ASF distributions or dual alpha FTS whilst it has been proved that dual alpha ASF is owing to the “dilution effect” resulting from holdup of reactor [155]. The incorporation of alcohols was discussed in Section 4.1.1 (Enolic mechanism) as the clue mentioned for this mechanism, however as considered in Section 4.1.1 (Enolic mechanism); this issue is rejected by investigators. In contrast, CO insertion is connected with merely syllogism in the absence of experimental evidence [161] while D tracing analysis [165] represented propagation must occur by CH+H instead of CH2 (or CO). 4.2.2 Mechanism of H-assisted CO dissociation The main constraint of mechanisms with CHx as monomer or initiator is being limited with the direct CO decomposition [195] and insufficient even for methane formation [196]. Thus, as represented in Fig. 13, While direct and indirect paths exists for CO decomposition, assuming H-assisted CO decomposition can be another solution [197]. Accordingly, CH is considered as a monomer which is in accordance with the alkylidene-hydride-methylidyne pathway. DFT and isotope analysis are key proofs of this route. According to DFT calculations, direct CO decomposition owes considerable activation barrier on the surface of Fe, cobalt and Ru catalysts [198] in contrast to the H-assisted one. Furthermore, an inverse H2-D2 isotope effect is the evidence for H involvement in CO decomposition [199]. It has been realized that size-dependent decomposition of CO on cobalt nano-particles is due to H-assisted CO decomposition [200]. Consequently H-assisted CO decomposition route combined with alkylidene-hydride-methylidyne pathway is the most likely FTS mechanism. Obviously, the main obstacle in these mechanisms is the absence of interaction between metal and support. According to formate mechanism section, the support can directly change the FTS mechanism. According to previous research achievements the metal oxides can highly enhance the CO dissociation and hydrogenation rates."
9,Mechanism derivation of CO2 hydrogenation based on findings reported in the preceding work,"A lack of micro-kinetic mechanism for RWGS and FTS since only fairly global final kinetic rate equations appear in the preceding research (Table 2). This section proposes a micro mechanism for this process in step by step detail as shown in Table 4. The main problem in explaining the MFTS reaction kinetics is the complexity of its reaction mechanism and the large number of species involved. Some investigations over 70 years old focused on the mechanism of the MFTS. Nevertheless, this topic remains controversial. Information regarding micro mechanisms (elementary reactions) that occur on the catalyst surface appears in the literature [201] and may provides some reasonable indications of the system. CO2 hydrogenation in the MFTS process involves hydrocarbon chain formation mechanisms. In the case of FTS reaction, there are two conceivable mechanisms based on the nature of CO adsorption on the active sites and the initiators formed. The first one: carbide mechanism, wherein CO is adsorbed dissociatively and carbide is the initiator intermediate and second one: enolic mechanism [202], in which molecular CO is adsorbed and an oxygenated intermediate is formed. In the first proposed mechanism, adsorbed CO and H2 dissociate and the adsorbed carbon produced from the dissociation of CO is hydrogenated by adsorbed hydrogen successively to produce methane and higher hydrocarbons [203,204]. In the latter mechanism, the molecular adsorption of CO and the dissociative adsorption of H2 are followed [205] by the reaction between a molecular H2 and adsorbed CO on the catalyst sites to produce an enolic intermediate. The enolic intermediate then reacts with adsorbed hydrogen successively to form water and hydrocarbons. To obtain the kinetic rate equations which were based on LHHW theory [36], the initial step is adopting a reaction mechanism. The reaction mechanisms for RWGS and FTS reactions were suggested based on different elementary reactions and carbon chain distribution routes and are summarized in Table 4. To derive each kinetic rate equation, one or more of the elementary reactions should be considered as the RDS, the one that is assumed as the slowest step and controls the total reaction rate [206]. All other steps are considered at equilibrium state. The kinetic rate equations are fitted against the experimental data to obtain the reaction and adsorption coefficients. Derivations of the kinetic rate equations for RWGS and FTS using the suggested mechanisms in Table 4 are explained in the following. According to Figs. 5 and 7, it is assumed that the reaction between the chemisorbed CO2 on the active sites of the catalyst (X) and a H2 molecule would be RDS (reaction 2 for CO2 shift reaction in Table 4) for RWGS reaction, as required by Eq. (8). (8) − r CO 2 = k 2 P H 2 [ CO 2 X ] − k − 2 [ COX ] P H 2 O where – r CO 2 is the rate of disappearance of CO2, k2 and k-2 are the forward and backward constant rate for the RDS. P H 2 and P H 2 O are representatives of hydrogen and water partial pressures in the gas mixture. In addition, CO2X and COX are indicatives of adsorbed states of CO2 and CO on the active sites. The expression rate of elementary reactions 1 and 3 which are at equilibrium can be expressed by Eq. (9) and (10). (9) k 1 P CO 2 X = k − 1 CO 2 X → K 1 P CO 2 X = CO 2 X (10) k 3 COX = k − 3 P CO X → COX = P CO X K 3 where P CO 2 and P CO indicate CO2 and CO, k1 and k3 are the forward reaction rate constants of reactions 1 and 3, and k-1 and k-3 are the corresponding backward rate constants. Incorporating Eqs. (9) and (10) into Eq. (8) gives Eq. (11) as below: (11) − r CO 2 = K 1 P CO 2 [ X ] P H 2 k 2 − k − 2 P H 2 O P CO [ X ] K 3 ⇒ − r CO 2 = [ X ] ( k 2 K 1 P H 2 P CO 2 − k − 2 P CO P H 2 O K 3 ) ⇒ − r CO 2 = k 2 K 1 ( P CO 2 P H 2 − k − 2 P CO P H 2 O k 2 K 1 K 3 ) [ X ] Considering k − 2 k 2 = K 2 , K 1 K 2 K 3 = K eq and k 2 K 1 = K SH 2 , the kinetic rate equation becomes as Eq. (12): (12) − r CO 2 = K SH 2 ( P CO 2 P H 2 − P CO P H 2 O K eq ) [ X ] X is the vacant sites fraction, and can be obtained from the balance Eq. (13) as follows: (13) [ X ] + [ H 2 OX ] + [ COX ] + [ H 2 X ] + [ CO 2 X ] = 1 The present species in the reaction system (H2O, CO, CO2 and H2) are competing with each other to the adsorption sites. Reactions associated with the species adsorption on the vacant sites and their corresponding reaction rates are listed in Table 5. The vacant sites fraction can be obtained by incorporating reaction rates 1–4 listed in Table 5 into Eq. (13) and gives Eq. (14), as below. (14) [ X ] = 1 1 + K 8 P H 2 O + K 9 P CO + K 10 P CO 2 + K 11 P H 2 Based on the findings from the empirical literature [207], the adsorption strengths of various gas molecules on Fe catalysts are different. It was also found that the chemisorption heats of CO and CO2 on the promoted Fe catalysts are comparable; CO and CO2 compete on the catalyst vacant sites. The presence of a term in the denominator representing the possible inhibition by CO2 seems essential. It has been generally observed that CO, CO2 and H2O are more strongly adsorbed than H2 on the surface of the carbidic species such as iron carbide that is formed in Fe catalysts [208]. According to the above explanation K 11 P H 2 is smaller than the other terms in the denominator; hence, Eq. (14) can be simplified to Eq. (15): (15) [ X ] = 1 K 8 P H 2 O + K 9 P CO + K 10 P CO 2 Assuming a SH 2 , H 2 O = K 8 K 9 and b SH 2 , H 2 O = K 10 K 9 in Eq. (14) and incorporating Eq. (15) into Eq. (12) the rate Eq. (16) of RWGS therefore becomes: (16) − r CO 2 = K SH 2 P CO 2 P H 2 − P CO P H 2 O K eq 1 P CO + b SH 2 , CO 2 P CO 2 + a SH 2 , H 2 O P H 2 O In the case of modified FTS, the RDS is the reaction of one molecule H2 with a CO chemisorbed on the active site of the catalyst (reaction 3 for FTS in Table 4), which can be expressed as an irreversible reaction (Eq. (17)). This reaction has been considered as the initiating step in some reaction systems reported in the literature [207]. (17) − r FT = k 3 [ COX ] P H 2 Adsorption of CO on the active catalyst sites is assumed [209] to be at equilibrium and consequently, the concentration of the adsorbed CO on the catalyst can be calculated as obtained in Eq. (18). (18) k 1 P CO [ X ] = k − 1 [ COX ] → [ COX ] = K 1 P CO [ X ] where k1 and k-1 are the rate constants for the forward and backward reactions in CO adsorption on the active sites, and K 1 = k 1 k − 1 . By substituting Eq. (18) into Eq. (17), Eq. (19) is obtained: (19) − r FT = k 3 K 1 P CO P H 2 X where k 3 K 1 = k FT Reactions associated with species adsorption on the active sites listed in Table 4 for RWGS are true for modified FTS as well. Thus, the concentration of the active sites is similar to the one for RWGS; therefore, it can be presented as Eq. (20). (20) [ X ] = 1 K 8 P H 2 O + K 9 P CO + K 10 P CO 2 → ÷ ( 1 1 K 9 ) [ X ] = 1 K 8 K 9 P H 2 O + P CO + K 10 K 9 P CO 2 where K 8 K 9 = a FT , H 2 O , K 10 K 9 = b FT , CO 2 , Hence, the kinetic rate for the modified FTS reaction is defined by Eq. (21). (21) − r FT = k FT P CO P H 2 a FT , H 2 O P H 2 O + P CO + b FT , CO 2 P CO 2 Previous studies [210] also indicated that the rate of total syngas conversion in FTS using a reduced promoted Fe catalyst at 225–265°C is directly related to partial pressure of H2 when both conversion and water partial pressure are low. Note that when the conversion and product partial pressures are higher, a more general equation should be used for the kinetic modeling [211]. Similar to this equation, other kinetic rate equations have been proposed in other research [212], in which a term for the hindering effect of H2O is considered [213]. Meanwhile, in some surveys, the inhibiting effects of both H2O and CO2 are included in the reaction kinetic rates [214]. The best results for FTS reactions on co-precipitated Fe catalysts (Fe-Cu-K) have been achieved by considering both inhibiting effects of H2O and CO2 [215,216]. Table 6 indicates an outline of the kinetic parameters for the FT reaction as follows:"
10,Proposed mechanism and kinetic,"In this section, the elementary reaction stages of MFTS based on the findings in the preceding researches are predicted by authors. The sequence of elementary steps describing the enolic mechanism is illustrated in Table 7. The predicted elementary steps for CO2 the shift reaction in this case (Table 7) and the predicted one for a derivation of the kinetic model proposed in the preceding research [36] (Table 4) are different, although both are based on the enolic mechanism. Considering the proposed mechanism, the kinetic model can be derived by using a LHHW approach. Similar to the procedures for kinetic derivation in the last section, at first one of the elementary stages was assumed as the RDS and, hence, the other stages were considered to be at the equilibrium state. The RDS for the FTS reaction in our proposed mechanism is assumed to be the same with the one used for the derivation of the kinetic equation by Riedel et al. [36]. However, the elementary stages for CO2 shift reaction in our presented mechanism is different from the one used for derivation of the kinetic equation proposed by Riedel et al [36]. For developing the LHHW kinetic rate, a number of assumptions were considered: (a) The intrinsic kinetic equation is proportional to the surface coverage of the main reactants and products; (b), The reaction between one molecule of CO2 and the atomic adsorbed hydrogen is the reversible RDS for the CO2 shift reaction and the reaction between one molecular H2 [217,218] and molecular adsorbed CO which produces the oxygenated (hydroxyl methylene) intermediate (CHOHX) is the RDS for FTS reaction. The other stages are considered at quasi-equilibrium; (c) Assuming steady-state conditions, as soon as intermediates reach the active sites they leave after being involved in the reaction, hence, they do not reside on the active catalyst sites; (d) the amount of catalyst is constant and catalyst is homogeneously distributed; (e) due to the dilution of the catalyst with SiO2 and low conversion, the operation can be assumed to be isothermal and (f) the concentration of CO on the catalyst surface is higher than hydrogen due to the stronger adsorption of CO on Fe catalyst. The derived kinetic model was fitted against the obtained experimental data. Derivation of the kinetic rate equations based on the suggested mechanism in Table 7 is explained in the following. As the reaction stages of FTS for current proposed mechanisms in Tables 4 and 7 are the same, the explanations regarding the FTS are not needed in this section. In this case, the reaction steps associated with the RWGS are explained here. Authors assumed that the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen is followed by the reaction between a molecular CO2 and adsorbed atomic hydrogen, which is considered as the RDS in the mechanism see Eq. (22). The adsorbed oxygenated intermediate (carboxyl group) produces CO and hydroxyl intermediate, which then forms molecular water by reaction with adsorbed atomic hydrogen. (22) − r CO 2 = k 2 P CO 2 [ HX ] − k − 2 [ CO 2 HX ] where – r CO 2 is the rate of disappearance of CO2, and k 2 and k − 2 are the forward and backward rate constant for the RDS. P CO 2 presents CO2 partial pressure in the gas mixture. In addition, HX and CO2HX indicate adsorbed states of atomic hydrogen and carboxyl intermediate on the active sites. The rate expressions of elementary reactions 1, 3 and 4, which are at equilibrium, can be expressed by Eqs. (23–25). (23) k 1 P H 2 [ X ] 2 = k − 1 [ HX ] 2 → K 1 P H 2 [ X ] 2 = [ HX ] 2 → [ HX ] = K 1 P H 2 [ X ] where K 1 = k 1 k − 1 (24) k 3 [ CO 2 HX ] = k − 3 P CO [ OHX ] → [ CO 2 HX ] = P CO [ OHX ] K 3 where K 3 = k 3 k − 3 (25) k 4 [ OHX ] [ HX ] = k − 4 P H 2 O [ X ] 2 → K 4 [ OHX ] [ HX ] = P H 2 O [ X ] 2 Eq. (26) is obtained by substituting Eq. (23) into Eq. (25): (26) K 4 K 1 P H 2 [ X ] [ OHX ] = P H 2 O [ X ] 2 → [ OHX ] = P H 2 O [ X ] K 4 K 1 P H 2 where K 4 = k 4 k − 4 By substituting Eq. (26) into Eq. (24), the concentration of carboxyl intermediate adsorbed on the vacant sites [ CO 2 HX ] becomes Eq. (27): (27) [ CO 2 HX ] = P CO P H 2 O [ X ] K 4 K 1 P H 2 K 3 where P H 2 O and P CO indicate the presence of H2O and CO. Incorporating Eqs. (23) and (27) into Eq. (22) gives Eq. (28): (28) − r CO 2 = [ X ] ( k 2 P CO 2 K 1 P H 2 − k − 2 P CO P H 2 O K 3 K 4 K 1 P H 2 ) At the equilibrium state: r forward = r b ackward → − r CO 2 = 0 Therefore: (29) k 2 P CO 2 K 1 P H 2 = k − 2 P CO P H 2 O K 3 K 4 K 1 P H 2 ⇒ K 1 K 2 K 3 K 4 = P CO P H 2 O P CO 2 P H 2 = K e q Then by incorporating Eq. (28) into (29), − r CO 2 becomes as Eq. (30): (30) − r CO 2 = [ X ] ( k 2 K 3 K 4 K 1 P CO 2 P H 2 − k − 2 P CO P H 2 O K 3 K 4 K 1 P H 2 ) ⇒ − r CO 2 = k 2 K 1 ( P CO 2 P H 2 − P CO P H 2 O K eq ) K 1 P H 2 [ X ] X, the vacant site fraction, can be calculated as mentioned before according to Eq. (12). By substituting Eq. (15) into Eq. (30), the rate of CO2 consumption can be obtained in Eq. (31). (31) − r CO 2 = K SH 2 ( P CO 2 P H 2 − P CO P H 2 O K eq ) ( 1 ( P H 2 ) ( P CO + b SH 2 , CO 2 P CO 2 + a SH 2 , H 2 O P H 2 O ) ) where K SH 2 = k 2 K 1 is the rate constant of the RWGS reaction. Consequently, the updated form of the kinetic rate equation is shown in Table 8."
11,Results and discussion,"The main purpose of current study is to achieve a probable mechanism to determine whether the catalyst alters CO2 hydrogenation behavior mechanistically or kinetically. It was postulated depending to the catalyst characterization as it may be plausible to alter the behavior of reaction intermediates as well as product selectivity by enhancing the metal interacting capability and supporting via structural modification. For nickel-alumina catalysts, it is reported that the chances of interaction between metal and support are much higher when they are cobalt-precipitated from a homogeneous solution [219]. Using Fe catalysts promoted with K, highly active catalysts for WGS reaction, leads to decreasing partial pressure of H2O while the partial pressure of CO2 is increased in the product stream [220]. This implies that there is a great opportunity for both H2O and CO2 to be adsorbed considerably on the active sites. Consequently, inhibition of both CO2 and H2O seems necessary. However, in cases that catalysts are not selective to WGS (high H2O/CO2 ratios), the possibility of inhibiting by CO2 is insignificant compared to H2O [221]. These results attest for MFTS, the reaction can be influenced by inhibiting effects of both H2O and CO2. Thus, the kinetic model should include both H2O and CO2 adsorption terms for the FTS and RWGS reactions. According to the Chen and Adesina [222] study, which improved alkene selectivity over a silica-supported cobalt-molybdenum catalyst, their data also suggest the carbide mechanism where the RDS is hydrogen dissociative adsorption. One of the main objections to the carbide mechanism is that it does not predict the formation of oxygen-containing compounds such as alcohols and aldehydes. Mentioned type of oxygenated products was not observed at any stage of the present study, which increases the plausibility of the model selected on the basis of initial rate data. Finally, the FT equation rate and mechanism just are generally stated for the MFTS process. Derivation the equation rate and mechanisms of FT in detail considering each component is too vital and of paramount interest for future research, to be compatible with the configuration of reactor as follows: Fig. 14a,b presents, a schematic diagram of permeable dual-type reactors for which the inner tubes of both reactors have been corrugated to increase the surface area. The integrated process [223] includes the fixed and fluidized bed as a first and second reactor respectively. Catalysts fill the outer tube of both reactors. The feed gas (CO2 and H2) is introduced into the inner tube of the second reactor (where there is no catalyst) from upside and is preheated by the reaction heat released from the exothermic FT. After leaving the reactor, the preheated reactant feed (CO2 + H2) is directed to the top of the outer tube and fed into the second reactor. To control the reaction stoichiometry in the first reactor and to prevent hydrogen from wasting in the second reactor, the wall of the inner tube for the second reactor was proposed to be hydrogen perm-selective. Moreover, the presence of a tubular H-SOD membrane layer (water perm-selective) inserted in the symmetric axis of the first reactor can strongly shift the RWGS reaction equilibrium to the right side and therefore, production of more carbon monoxide. In this stage, feed (H2 + CO2) is converted to CO through endothermic RWGS reaction and the reaction heat is supplied by the surrounded furnace of the first reactor. The outlet gas from the first reactor leaves the reactor and enters the outer tube of the second reactor, in a counter-current mode with the reactant feed (H2 + CO2) flowing from top to down inside the inner tube. The chemical reaction occurs on the catalyst surface, and the feed removes the generated heat (CO2 + H2) inside the inner tube. Finally, by passing through a heat exchanger, the product temperature is decreased while that of the reactant is increased. Finally, the effect of reactor type is the most significant among the other factors such as catalyst type and operating conditions which are in accordance with the results of Saeidi et al. [21]. The interesting point here is that our research on hydrocarbon production has demonstrated quite similar results in the same sequence which strongly validates our novel proposed reactor."
12,Conclusions,"As a major greenhouse gas, CO2 with increased concentration in the atmosphere is considered to be responsible for global warming and climate change. Consequently, the reduction of CO2 concentration has come into global focus. As studied in the current review, hydrogenation of CO2 is a feasible and powerful process in this regard. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 4 CO2 hydrogenation produces a low C/H ratio because of slow CO2 adsorption rates on the surface due to the thermodynamically and chemicaly stable CO2. The hydrogenation of surface-adsorbed intermediates favors methane formation with a decline in chain growth. However, the results highlighted that both catalyst properties and reactor design, played crucial roles in the hydrogenation of CO2 to hydrocarbon. But based on the used catalyst in the reaction, kinetic rates equations were different (Table 1). It is obvious that catalyst characterization is of paramount importance since by improving the metal interacting ability and supporting through structural modifications as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, catalyst is plausible in determining reaction intermediates and product selectivity. A lack of micro-kinetic mechanism for RWGS and FTS was obvious since only fairly global final kinetic rate equations appeared in the preceding research (Table 2). The reaction mechanisms for RWGS and FTS reactions were suggested based on different elementary reactions and carbon chain distribution routes were summarized in Table 4. Moreover, the kinetic rate should cover the investigated range of operating conditions for future scale-up studies which has been confirmed by various kinetic model equations, obtained for different catalysts compositions and active materials Table 6. Results revealed that, CO2 and H2 compete together to adsorb on the same kind of site on most transition metals (Fig. 7). Since CO2 has higher adsorption heat than hydrogen, the concentration of adsorbed carbon species is greater than surface hydrogen. Studied kinetics on impregnated Fe-K/γ-Al2O3 catalyst have indicated the surface reaction between adsorbed carbon and hydrogen as the RDS. The data obtained at different H2/CO2 ratios and studied properties of CO2 and H2 adsorption of co-precipitated Fe-K 34wt% /γ-Al2O3 catalyst suggested that the consumption rate of CO2 was limited by the concentration of adsorbed hydrogen. The RDS was likely to be the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen on the catalyst surface as depicted in Figs. 5 and 7. Kinetic rate equations presented in Table 8 were derived based on the suggested mechanisms in Table 7. In fact, it was speculated that the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen was followed by the reaction between a molecular CO2 and adsorbed atomic hydrogen, which was considered as the RDS in the mechanism. Subsequently, the adsorbed oxygenated intermediate (carboxyl group) produced CO and hydroxyl intermediate, which then forms molecular water by reaction with adsorbed atomic hydrogen. Among all proposed mechanisms presented in Table 3, it was found that merely carbide and enolic played the main role in deriving mechanisms in Tables 4 and 7. It was indicated that one of the main objections to the carbide mechanism (Fig. 10) was that it could not predict the formation of oxygen-containing compounds such as alcohols and aldehydes as illustrated in Fig. 9. The mentioned type of oxygenated products was not observed at any stage of the present study, which was an indication of plausibility of the proposed model on the basis of initial rate data. Besides, the proposed reactor type possessed higher efficiency, selectivity and thermal stability in the hydrogenation of CO2. However, significant improvements in reactor design toward achieving the novel reactor configuration would be necessary (Fig. 14). The proposed novel reactor configuration would meet the carbide mechanism due to preventing carbon formation over catalyst because of the permeability of first reactor toward water. It also controlled the dosing of hydrogen due to its hydrogen permeable membrane in the second reactor. Finally, it should be emphasized that the pressure drop in the second reactor would be reduced in the fluidized-bed reactor. The general advantages of proposed dual-type membrane reactors are as follows: 1. The possibility of heat integration: due to the two existing kinds of reactions with regard to the reaction mechanism in this multi reaction system. In fact, circulation stream from the exothermic to endothermic reactor resulted in preheating feed stream prior to entering the endothermic reactor. 2. Increased reaction rates: as the second reactor is hydrogen perm-selective the dose of hydrogen along the reactor could be controlled. 3. Reduced byproduct formation: owing to the perm-selectivity of the first reactor towards water, fast deactivation of catalyst with formation of carbon deposition on catalyst was prevented. Finally, this reactor configuration fitted with predicted reaction mechanisms for hydrogenation of CO2 to hydrocarbon (Figs. 5 and 7). The above mentioned points can clearly validate the outcomes of this research. Eventually, the introduction of a dual type membrane reactor not only reduced energy consumption, but also breaked the reaction equilibrium while adjusting the dose of H2 and removal of H2O in situ. Future research should certainly emphasize rational reactor design in order to intensify reaction toward the product side while maintaining the catalyst activity during the reaction by considering the spherical reactor to increase the surface area of the first reactor wall as illustrated in Fig. 15."
