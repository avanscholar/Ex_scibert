0,Introduction,"Several kinds of polymer materials are now used in our daily lives because of their useful properties, such as low cost and durability [1]. However, polymer materials are also well-known to be easily degraded because of exposure to heat, light, mechanical stress, and other factors. The degradation phenomena and participating factors must be clearly understood to enhance the reliability and stability of polymer materials. Some studies have suggested that polymer degradation occurs through radical reactions [2–5]; therefore, direct observation of such reactions is very important for prolonging the lifetime of polymer materials. However, directly observing radical species is generally difficult because they are unstable and very short-lived. Typically, Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR), ultraviolet–visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-VIS), gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS), or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) are used to analyze polymer-degradation mechanisms [6–12]. However, the mechanisms suggested by these methods are based only upon the reaction products apparent after degradation; the radical intermediates and reaction schemes involved in the mechanism can only be predicted indirectly, and the details of the degradation reactions for most polymers are therefore not sufficiently clear. If it can be determined which radical species act in the degradation mechanism, a causal treatment that will serve as a countermeasure against such degradation may be developed. Electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis may be useful for investigating the degradation reaction because it is the only method that can observe the radical species. However, because radical intermediates are short-lived to be observed by a common ESR equipment, we needed to apply a special method to detect them—namely, a spin-trapping method (see Scheme 1 ). Such a method can allow the molecular structures of radical intermediates to be identified by trapping the short-lived species with a spin-trapping reagent. Because the spin adduct produced by trapping has a long enough lifetime to be observed by general ESR measurement, it provides information on the molecular structure around the unpaired electron and the number of radicals produced. The spin-trapping method can also allow various radicals formed simultaneously from each other to be discerned via their spectral profiles by spectral simulation with taking into account the hyperfine structure (hfs) of the ESR spectrum. Using this unique method, we recently revealed the thermal degradation mechanisms of poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) [13] and PBT-related thermoplastic elastomer [14]. In this paper, we focused on the thermal degradation of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). PVA is widely used in industry because of its water solubility, superior weathering resistance, good film-forming behavior, adhesion, and biodegradability [15]. It is used as a packing film for agrochemicals, an ingredient in synthetic fibers, an adhesive, and in other applications. Therefore, the thermal degradation mechanism of PVA has been investigated and reported many times in the past. In 2002, Alexy et al. studied PVA degradation by TGA and concluded that elimination of water occurs by heating from 130 to 260 °C, as shown by Reaction (1) in Scheme 2 [16]. However, in 2007, Peng et al. reported that dehydration occurs above around 300 °C based on results by TGA, FT-IR, and GC/MS [7]. Moreover, in 2014, Dong et al. used TGA and summarized that the degradation mechanism of PVA proceeds between 230 °C and 320 °C according to the Reaction (1)–(4) in Scheme 2 [17]. First, an allylic alcohol is produced through water elimination (1) and then a hydroxyl group next to the allyl moiety detaches because the allylic alcohol has a weak structure (2). Then, the hydroxyl radical abstracts the hydrogen on the PVA chain to produce the secondary carbon radical (3). The main chain radical generates a hydroxyl radical again through β-scission (4). Although some studies on PVA degradation have previously been reported as described above, the degradation–initiation temperatures in those reports differ by about 100 °C; moreover, whether or not a hydroxyl radical is produced depends on the authors. Because the reaction mechanism in Scheme 2 was investigated by general analytical methods such as TGA, FT-IR, and GC/MS, no direct evidence was found as to whether the intermediate radical is produced. In this study, we applied the spin-trapping method of ESR to identify the intermediate radicals produced through thermal degradation of PVA. We also investigated it experimentally using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) to observe changes in the molecular weight (M.W.) distribution of PVA before and after thermal annealing."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Fig. 1 shows the materials used in our experiment. Two types of PVAs—PVA500(87) and PVA5-98 were used. PVA500(87) was purchased from Nacalai Tesque, Inc., and PVA5-98 was kindly supplied by Kuraray Co., Ltd. The degree of polymerization was 500 for both PVAs. The degrees of saponification were 87 wt% and 98 wt% for PVA500(87) and PVA5-98, respectively. Both PVAs were purified twice by reprecipitation using water and acetone. The spin-trapping reagent, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO), demethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, super dehydrated, < 10 ppm), and the solvent, 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), were purchased from FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corp. and used without further purification. Another spin-trapping reagent, 3,5-dibromo-4-nitrosobenzenesulfonate (DBNBS) was purchased from Kyoto-Spinlabo Co., Ltd., and also used without further purification."
3,Sample preparation,"2.2 Sample preparation PVA samples for ESR measurement were prepared from HFIP solutions of PVA with DMPO or DBNBS by a solution-casting method. Because DMPO and DBNBS are sensitive to light, the mixed solution was prepared in the dark. The cast PVA samples were dried under nitrogen for 10 h at room temperature (R.T.) and then again under a vacuum for 10 h at 80 °C in the dark. The concentrations of DMPO or DBNBS in PVA were 3 or 10 wt%, respectively. A PVA/DMPO or PVA/DBNBS sample of 0.1 g was packed in a 5 mm-φ quartz tube, and the tube was purged by nitrogen to perform ESR measurement. For GPC measurement, three PVA5-98 samples without spin-trapping reagent were annealed for 10 h under nitrogen at 100 °C, 150 °C, and 200 °C, respectively."
4,Measurements,"2.3 Measurements The radicals generated during thermal degradation of PVA were observed by an ESR spectrometer (JES-TE300, JEOL) using an X-band microwave. The measurement conditions were as follows: the microwave frequency was ~9.2 GHz, the microwave power was 2.0 mW, the center of the magnetic field was 0.32 T, and the modulation width was 0.1 mT. The Mn2+ in MgO was used as a magnetic field standard. The sample temperature was controlled from R.T. to 200 °C by a thermal controller unit (DVT3, JEOL). The ESR spectra were analyzed by self-programmed software with theoretical Gaussian and Lorentzian functions. Initially, four spectral parameters for each peak—namely, the central magnetic field, the area intensity, the peak-to-peak width, and the ratio of the Gaussian and Lorentzian functions—were manually inputted into the program for all peaks in the ESR spectrum. Finally, the measured ESR spectrum was reproduced using theoretical peaks by a computational-approximation fitting routine. Through GPC measurement, M.W. distribution changes in PVA were measured before and after heating by the GPC system (HLC-8320GPC with one column of GMHHR-H(S), Tosoh). An HFIP solution with a small amount of CF3COONa was used as the eluent and the M.W. were calibrated with poly(methyl methacrylate) standards. The PVA sample was first dissolved in HFIP solution and then filtered using a 0.45 μm-sized pore membrane. The injected sample concentration of PVA to HFIP was 0.1 wt%. In each measurement, a sample of 10 μL was injected at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The temperatures of the columns and the detector were maintained at 40 °C. The number of average M.W., M n, and the weight of average M.W., M w, were calculated from the distribution curve. To compare the change in the M.W. distribution at each heating temperature, the area of the GPC curves was normalized such that each area was the same."
5,Results & discussion,
6,Spin-trapping analysis,"3.1 Spin-trapping analysis Firstly, the ESR spectra of PVA5-98/DMPO were measured, however, it was not possible to obtain ESR spectra with a high signal/noise ratio. This was because of the strong absorption of microwave of ESR equipment due to the high dielectric constant of the sample. Therefore, the ESR measurements were mainly conducted using PVA500(87). Fig. 2 shows the thermal dependence of the ESR spectrum of PVA500(87) with 10 wt% DMPO upon stepwise heating from R.T. to 200 °C. No ESR signal was observed at R.T.; however, some characteristic signals appeared from 80 °C and changed in intensity as temperature increased. In the case in which no spin-trapping reagent was added to the PVA sample, no ESR signal was observed upon heating. Therefore, the symmetric hfs of the ESR signals in Fig. 2 indicates that some stable spin adducts were produced during heating through the spin-trapping of radical intermediates, which were produced via thermal degradation. From 80 °C to 140 °C, the spin adducts with three lines indicated by ■ were mainly observed with other small peaks; however, six new lines indicated by ▲ appeared above 160 °C with the decrease of the three lines. Fig. 3 shows the thermal dependence of the ESR spectrum of PVA500(87) with 3 wt% DMPO upon stepwise heating from R.T. to 200 °C. Comparing the hfs with that in Fig. 2, the six lines indicated by ▲ were the main components, and the three lines indicated by ■ were not clearly observed upon overall heating. This difference between Figs. 2 and 3 indicates that the spin adduct with three lines was derived from a self-trapping reaction by the DMPO. Therefore, the ESR spectra in Fig. 3 were more suitable than those in Fig. 2 for spectral analysis for identifying the intermediate radical species generated from the PVA."
7,Simulation analysis of PVA/DMPO,"3.2 Simulation analysis of PVA/DMPO The ESR spectra in Fig. 3, which were composed of multiple signals, were analyzed via computational simulation using theoretical functions to separate them into independent spectral components via several spin adducts. Fig. 4 shows one of the deconvolution results for the spectrum of PVA500(87) with 3 wt% DMPO, as annealed at 200 °C. As shown in Fig. 4, the hfs of the observed ESR spectrum was found to be composed of five spin adduct components, S1 –S5 . Similar to this result for 200 °C, the other ESR spectra from 120 to 180 °C also included the same five spin adduct components, albeit with different amount ratios. In Table 1 , the spectral parameters of each spin adduct (including the hyperfine coupling constant (hfcc) and g-value), as well as each molecular structure determined by the hfcc, are shown, together with the reference values used to assign the spin adduct. The assignments of S1 –S5 were performed via detailed considerations described below. The S1 component consists of six lines with two hfccs: a N = 1.52 mT, from one nitrogen atom, and a H = 1.25 mT, from one hydrogen. Kalyanaraman et al. who reported that a spin adduct with hfccs of a N = 1.46 mT and a H = 1.20 mT was observed in a Fenton reaction of tert-butanol using DMPO, claimed that the six lines were derived from hydroxyl radical, •OH [18]. Because these hfcc values were very close to our own for S1, we presumed that S1 was also derived from the hydroxyl radical •OH. Indeed, in Table 1, the hfccs for S2 –S4 tended to show smaller values than those for the references. These differences may arise because the reaction matrix in our system, which is the PVA polymer, had a different dielectric circumstance from those in the reference system, water, and/or ethanol. Conversely, the difference between the hfcc values for S1 and the reference values was a little larger. This may be because the solvent in the S1 reference was butanol. The S2 component was simulated using six lines with two hfccs: a N = 1.65 mT and a H = 2.30 mT. Kalyanaraman et al. reported that a secondary carbon radical, CH3–•CH–CH3, was observed using DMPO by a free-radical activation of iproniazid in water and the hfccs of the spin adduct were a N = 1.61 mT and a H = 2.44 mT [19]. These values were very close to our results for S2 . Taking account of the above analysis of S1 , the original radicals for S2 trapped by DMPO could be assigned to –CH=CH–•CH–CH2–. These were produced by thermal homolysis of the PVA main chain at the –CH2–CH(OH)–CH2– moiety. Conversely, the reaction system of PVA/DMPO may contain some water because the PVA has very high hygroscopicity. Therefore, •OH could have been generated by a reaction of water with other molecules. This point is discussed in the next section using PVA/DBNBS. The S3 component showed an hfs of six lines with two hfccs: a N = 1.35 mT and a H = 2.25 mT. In general, the a N of the DMPO spin adduct derived from an alkyl radical is around 1.6 mT and a H is near 2.3 mT [20]. According to a report by Kirino et al. the hfccs of a DMPO spin adduct by •CH3 were a N = 1.633 mT and a H = 2.324 mT; however, the hfccs for that by •CH2OH were a N = 1.587 mT and a H = 2.257 mT, both of which are smaller than those by •CH3 [21]. These differences in a N and a H may come from the trapping of a different kind of radical with or without a •C-O group in its structure. Thus, in our case, although a N = 1.35 mT for S 3 is smaller than that found by Kirino et al. (also considered the matrix effect described above), we concluded that S 3 might be derived from •C-O structure radicals. Moreover, Searle et al. who investigated the reaction of Fe(II) and cysteine in the mixture of H2O and ethanol or propanol with DMPO, reported that two types of radical carbon connected to oxygen atoms produced two spin adducts with similar hfccs; one was derived from CH3–•C(OH)–CH3 with a N = 1.52 mT and a H = 2.28 mT and the other was derived from •CH(OH)–CH2– with a N = 1.57 mT and a H = 2.24 mT [22]. We also assigned S3 derived from •C-O radical; however, it was difficult to determine whether S3 was derived from •CH(OH)–CH2– or –CH2–•C(OH)–CH2– because the hfs difference between these two was on the order of a few percentage points. This was too small to result in a different spectrum in a solid sample of PVA, in which slower molecular motion makes the line width wider than in a liquid. The assignment of S3 is discussed in the next section using DBNBS. The largest signal S4 in Fig. 4, as indicated by ▲, could be simulated using a N = 1.51 mT and a H = 2.05 mT. By comparing the difference between Figs. 2 and 3 for DMPOs of 10 wt% and 3 wt%, respectively, with refering the standard peaks of Mn2+, it was obvious that the intensities of the six lines were strongly related to the DMPO concentration. This supported the argument that S4 was assigned to a spin adduct derived from the degradation of DMPO itself. Finkelstein reported that six similar lines were produced by the degradation of DMPO when an oxidation of xanthine in water was studied and the hfccs were found to be a N = 1.53 mT and a H = 2.20 mT [23], which are very similar to our parameters. To complete the spectral simulation in Fig. 4, a component with three lines with a N = 1.46 mT was needed. This value of a N is quite similar to that reported for DMPO-X by L. Chen et al., a N = 1.45 mT [24]. Those authors suggested that, although the structural assignment was indeed not clear, the spin adduct was produced by sequential reactions via two kinds of DMPO spin adducts, one from •OH and the other from a radical of poly(ethylene oxide) [24]. As will be discussed below, the amount of radical in S5 in Fig. 3 was throughly constant on heating and the smallest (<0.072) among the observed spin adducts; we concluded that S5 was not related to PVA degradation in this study. We had similarly performed the radical analysis on neat poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) using DMPO. However, no apparent spin-adduct component derived from polymer degradation, other than S 4 and S 5 , was observed in the ESR spectra of PVAc/DMPO. Therefore, it can be said that the observed results on PVA500(87) in this study originated from the degradation of PVA moiety, not from the vinyl acetate one."
8,Spin-trapping analysis of PVA/DBNBS,"3.3 Spin-trapping analysis of PVA/DBNBS In Sections 3.1 and 3.2, DMPO was used to identify the radicals produced during the thermal degradation of PVA. However, it was difficult to distinguish the original carbon radical species for the spin adduct S3 . This is a common problem for nitrone-type spin-trapping reagents such as DMPO because the interaction between the β-hydrogen on the trapped radical and the unpaired electron on the nitroxide group of the spin adduct is not strong enough to show the apparent difference from the hfcc of β-hydrogen. In this section, instead of DMPO, our analysis was performed using DBNBS, a nitroso-type spin-trapping reagent. Because the DBNBS spin adduct shows a closer distance between the trapped radical moiety and the unpaired electron, it easier to identify the spin adduct by differences in the number of splits and the hfcc in the observed spectrum. DBNBS also has a hydrophilic property due to the sulfo group, which is suitable for doping in the PVA matrix. Fig. 5 shows the result of ESR measurement for PVA500(87) with 3 wt% DBNBS. Unsymmetrical hfss were obtained by stepwise heating up to 200 °C; however, these were not suitable for assigning spin adducts in the spectral simulation. The unresolved hfss indicated that the molecular motion of the spin adducts was strongly restricted, possibly by the strong hydrogen bond between the sulfo group of the DBNBS-derived spin adducts and that of the PVA. To solve this problem, we conducted ESR measurement on a liquid-state sample dissolved in super-dehydrated DMSO solvent. The weight fractions were prepared with PVA500(87):DBNBS:DMSO = 10.1 wt%:0.3 wt%:89.6 wt%. Fig. 6 shows the result of ESR measurement for PVA/DBNBS/DMSO upon stepwise heating from R.T. to 180 °C. Unlike the solid-state sample in Fig. 5, ESR spectra with symmetric hfss were observed. First, three lines appeared from R.T. to 80 °C; then, more complex hfss appeared instead of these lines from 120 °C. Fig. 7 shows one of the deconvolution results for the spectrum of PVA500(87)/DBNBS/DMSO, as annealed at 160 °C. Table 2 summarizes the spectral parameters of each spin adduct and the reference values used to assign these adducts. The spectrum was composed of three spin adducts, S6 –S8 . These adducts were assigned based on the considerations below. S6 was simulated by 18 lines with a N = 1.30 mT from one nitrogen, a H = 0.05 mT from one hydrogen of OH, and a Hm = 0.06 mT from two meta-hydrogens on a benzene ring. However, S6 apparently showed three lines because a H and a Hm were very small. Kohno et al. reported a signal with hfss of a N = 1.24 mT and a H = 0.063 mT in the reaction system of Fe and H2O2 using DBNBS [25]. This Fenton reaction was catalyzed by Fe to produce •OH and H2O from H2O2. They concluded that the spin adduct was derived from •OH trapping. Because the hfss of the reported signal and S6 in Fig. 7 were close, we concluded that the observed S6 was also derived from •OH. S7 consisted of 24 lines with a N = 1.35 mT, a H = 0.89 mT, and a Hm = 0.10 mT; however, it showed six lines for close values of a H and a Hm. Ozawa et al. observed a component of six lines with a N = 1.40 mT and a H = 0.92 mT during photolysis of H2O2 in butanol with DBNBS, and the component was attributed to •CH(OH)–CH3 [26]. Because these hfccs were very close to our own, we concluded that the S7 observed in Fig. 7 was derived from the •CH(OH)–CH2– produced by the main chain scission of the PVA. In the case of nitrone-type DMPO in Table 1, two radicals, •CH(OH)–CH2– and –CH2–•C(OH)–CH2–, were candidates for the original radical species of S3 . Therefore, the S3 value observed by DMPO was most likely to be derived from •CH(OH)–CH2–. The most complicated S8 had 36 lines with a N = 1.35 mT, a H = 1.16 mT, and a Hm = 0.05 mT; however, the hfs showed 12 lines due to the small value of a Hm. Ozawa et al. reported that 12 lines with hfccs of a N = 1.493 mT, a H = 1.279 mT, and a Hm = 0.082 mT were observed through •CH3 trapping when DMSO was investigated [27]. The reaction of •CH3 generation occurs as shown in Scheme 3 below; Thus, for S8 , although there were slight differences between our values of hfcc and the reference, we concluded that the observed S8 was derived from •CH3, which was produced by the reaction between DMSO and •OH. Concerning the assignment of S1 for the PVA/DMPO system (as described above), since PVA has a high hygroscopicity, the trapped radical •OH may come from residual water in the sample rather than from the PVA main chain. The effect of residual water was therefore investigated by measuring the H2O/DBNBS/DMSO system for comparison with the result in Fig. 7. The weight fractions were prepared with H2O:DBNBS:DMSO = 0.63 wt%:0.02 wt%:99.34 wt% considering that the concentration of H2O in this system was around 6 wt% of the PVA used in the PVA/DBNBS/DMSO system. Fig. 8 shows the results of the ESR measurement of H2O/DBNBS/DMSO upon stepwise heating from R.T. to 180 °C. It is apparent that the ESR spectra were much different from those for PVA/DMPO/DMSO and were mainly composed of two spin adduct components: three lines indicated by ▼ symbol and six lines by ●. Fig. 9 shows one of the deconvolution results for the ESR spectrum of H2O/DBNBS/DMSO, as annealed at 160 °C. Table 3 summarizes the spectral parameters used for the simulation. The spectrum could be reproduced by three spin adducts, S6′, S8′, and S 9 . Because both S6′ and S8′ had similar hfcc parameters to S6 and S8 in Table 2, respectively, S6′ and S8′ were also concluded to have been derived from •OH and •CH3, respectively. However, the intensity of S6 ′ in Fig. 8 was much smaller than that in Fig. 6; for example, the intensity of S6′ at 160 °C in Fig. 9 was less than 10% of that of S6 in Fig. 7 in a comparison based on the intensity of the standard Mn2+ peak. These result strongly suggests that the S6 component by •OH trapping, as observed in the PVA/DBNBS/DMSO system in Fig. 6, was derived from the thermal degradation of PVA. Meanwhile, S9 was not observed in Figs. 6 and 7 for the PVA liquid system. Ichimori et al. reported that a similar signal with hfccs of a N = 1.42 mT and a H = 0.93 mT for –•CH– was observed by a measurement of platelet with DBNBS [28]. These parapeters were very close to our owns; a N = 1.35 mT and a H = 1.07 mT. As a supplementary experiment, when we heated a deuterated DMSO‑d 6 (CD3–SO–CD3) sample with DBNBS at 160 °C, the six lines for S9 had completely disappeared and a new component of fine 27 lines was observed. The hfccs of the new spin adduct could be simulated by supposing –•CD–, not –•CH–, using a N = 1.34 mT, a D = 0.19 mT, and a Hm = 0.05 mT. Because the ratio of hfccs based on S9 and the new spin adduct, a H/a D = 5.98, was close to the gyromagnetic ratio for hydrogen and deuterium, H/D = 6.51, S9 (or the new spin adduct) was positively assigned to a spin adduct derived from a secondary carbon radical, –•CH–, by the solvent DMSO (or –•CD– in the case of DMSO‑d 6). However, the detailed structure of the spin adduct could not be determined because DMSO has no –CH2– moiety. When •OH is produced by the degradation of PVA, the production of the counterpart –CH2–•CH–CH2– is also strongly expected. Fig. 4 and Table 1 show that the production of –CH2–•CH–CH2– was confirmed for S2 in the DMPO system; however, for the DBNBS system, no component from this main chain radical was observed. The reason for this may be that DBNBS had two bromine atoms next to the trapping site and the steric-hindrance effect was so large that the main chain radical, –CH2–•CH–CH2–was not trapped."
9,Changes in the radical amount,"3.4 Changes in the radical amount The relative radical amounts of the spin adducts S 1 –S 7 during stepwise heating in Figs. 3 and 6 were determined by double integration of each spectral component assigned in the above sections. Figs. 10 and 11 show the results for PVA500(87) with 3 wt% DMPO and PVA500(87) with 3 wt% DBNBS, respectively. Those radical amounts were normalized using the standard peak of Mn2+ in each spectrum. Fig. 10 shows that, for PVA500(87)/DMPO, the amounts of S 1 , S 2 , and S 3 , which were attributed to the radicals derived from thermal degradation of the PVA, increased simply as temperature increased. This indicates that more PVA decomposition occurs through radical reactions at higher temperatures. At 180 and 200 °C, the rate of increase (i.e., the slope of the curve) of S 3 , which was derived from the main chain scission radial •CH(OH)–CH2–, was larger than that of S 1 and S 2 , which were derived from •OH and –CH2–•CH–CH2–, respectively. This difference suggests that the main chain scission occurs much more frequently at higher temperatures of around 180 and 200 °C. Fig. 11 shows that, for PVA500(87)/DBNBS, the amounts of S 6 and S 7 , which were assigned to the thermal degradation of PVA, increased as temperature increased up to 160 °C. From 160 to 180 °C, however, they either decreased or went unchanged. This is because the S 6 derived from •OH cannot withstand temperatures as high as 180 °C. However, the radical S 7 derived from •CH(OH)–CH2– maintained its amount; this is for the same reason as S 3 in Fig. 10; the main chain scission proceeded prominently at 180 °C."
10,Changes in the M.W. Distribution,"3.5 Changes in the M.W. Distribution M.W. changes after annealing for 10 h at 100 °C, 150 °C, and 200 °C were investigated in PVA5-98 via GPC measurement. The samples that were unheated and annealed at 100 and 150 °C were completely dissolved in the eluent HFIP prior to measurement. However, because the sample annealed at 200 °C was not completely dissolved in HFIP and showed gelation, we measured the liquid part of the sample after separating it from the gel part. Fig. 12 shows the M.W. distribution curves of PVA5-98. Table 4 summarizes the average M.W., M w and M n. The main peak in the blank PVA appeared at M.W. = 42,700 (log M.W. = 4.63). After annealing at 100 and 150 °C for 10 h, the distribution curves did not change significantly; however, M w increased by a large amount and M n also tended to increase. These changes suggest that the distribution at higher M.W. increased under heating. The change can indeed be confirmed for the curves around log M.W. = 5.3–6.2 in Fig. 12. Conversely, the sample annealed at 200 °C showed a striking decrease for both M w and M n, as well as the prominent movement of the distribution curve towards lower M.W. Considering the gelation phenomena after annealing, as described above, it is apparent that a cross-linking reaction dominantly occurred in PVA under heating between 100 °C and 150 °C, and the main scission reaction also occurred to a significant degree at 200 °C, together with cross-linking. This tendency toward decomposition at higher temperatures was also confirmed by the increasing radical amount of S 3 in Fig. 10 and S 7 in Fig. 11, as described above."
11,Reaction mechanism of PVA thermal degradation,"3.6 Reaction mechanism of PVA thermal degradation In this study, the PVA sample that we used included a certain number of repeating units of poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc), –CH2–CH(OCOCH3)–: 13 wt% for PVA500(87) and 2 wt% for PVA5-98. Therefore, the ESR spectra measured in this study might have contained a component from a PVAc unit. However, when a neat PVAc was investigated instead of a PVA by the same method described above, the ESR measurement of the PVAc with 3 wt% DMPO showed two kinds of spin adducts, S4 and S5 . These are thought to have been derived from the degradation of DMPO, as shown in Table 1. This result suggests that the acetate group was hardly involved in the degradation reaction; thus, the thermal degradation mechanisms we observed in this paper were thought to occur mostly in the PVA unit. The reaction scheme was deduced based on the above discussions and is summarized in Scheme 4 . ESR measurements using both DMPO and DBNBS showed that •OH was produced by the thermal degradation of PVA. Scheme 5 compares the bond–dissociation energies before and after the formation of the double bond on the PVA chain [29]. Scheme 5 shows that the energy between the hydroxyl group and the main chain, 399.2 kJ/mol, is higher than those of the other bonds in the PVA structure; this suggests that elimination of the OH group is unlikely to occur. Conversely, Alexy et al. reported that the first step of PVA decomposition starts at around 130 °C with a dehydration reaction of the hydroxyl group and β-hydrogen [16]. Therefore, we also considered the possibility that the dehydration reaction first occurs by heating at around 120 °C (Reaction (1) in Scheme 4); however, we could not confirm this dehydration using ESR. Scheme 5 shows that the dehydration results in the formation of a double bond and reduces the bond-dissociation energy at neighboring C–OH. Dissociation near the double bond is considered to occur favorably, resulting in the formation of –CHCH–•CH– (R1) and •OH, which were observed as the spin adducts S2 for R1 , and S1 and S6 for •OH, respectively. The production of •CH(OH)–CH2– (R3 in Scheme 4) was confirmed by both DMPO and DBNBS through spin adducts S3 and S7 , respectively. Typically, this chain-end radical is thought to be produced by a β-scission from the main chain radical; in this case of PVA, –CH2–•C(OH)–CH2– (R2 ). Because the bond dissociation energy at α-hydrogen is the lowest among the bonds of hydrogen in the PVA, as seen from the left structure in Scheme 5, we considered the possibility that the •OH generated by the main chain decomposition abstracts the α-hydrogen followed by a production of R2 (Reaction (3)). The main chain radical R2 decomposes by β-scission, producing another main chain radical, R3 (Reaction (4)). The counterpart terminal double bond is unstable and is likely to be converted into a ketone by tautomerization (Reaction (5)). According to Holland [30] and Peng [7], who investigated PVA degradation by GC/MS, formaldehyde and other compounds were found to have been produced through thermal decomposition of PVA at around 275 °C and 330 °C. Therefore, although the temperature of our study was lower than that of theirs, the generated terminal radical R3 may produce formaldehyde and a chain-end radical (R4 ) (Reaction (6)). A cross-linking reaction occurred under heating at 200 °C based on the gelation, as described in the GPC result. The radicals involved in cross-linking should mostly be the main chain radicals R1 and R2 . However, since R1 can have a stable resonance structure, it is considered more stable than R2 . We therefore assumed that the cross-linking reaction mostly proceeds through recombination of R2 (Reaction (7))."
12,Conclusions,"We applied the spin-trapping method of ESR to identify the intermediate radicals produced through thermal degradation of PVA. For this purpose, two different types of spin-trapping reagent—DMPO and DNBNS—were applied. During thermal degradation of PVA from R.T. to 200 °C, two intermediate radicals, •OH and •CH(OH)–CH2–, were detected by the spin-trapping method of ESR measurement. The production of •OH was found to be a key factor in PVA degradation, because the main chain scission radical, •CH(OH)–CH2–, is produced by β-scission from the main chain radical –CH2–•C(OH)–CH2–, which was not observed in this study but should have been produced through the hydrogen abstraction of •OH. Thus, it can be considered that the degradation of PVA can be prevented by adding a reagent that can effectively capture •OH, for example, flavonoids, which is known for a good •OH scavenger [31]. The independent radical amounts of spin adducts were estimated, and those amounts were found to increase simply by heating to a higher temperature. The GPC measurement indicated that the cross-linking reaction occurred more often at temperatures above 100 °C and that the main chain scission also occurred significantly at around 200 °C. These results were consistent with the tendency for radical changes in the amounts of spin adducts observed by ESR. The temperature at which we observed radical production ranged from 120 to 200 °C, which is much lower than in previous reports, where it ranges from 200 to 500 °C [7,12,17,30]. The radical reactions found in this study are believed to constitute the initial stage of PVA thermal degradation."
