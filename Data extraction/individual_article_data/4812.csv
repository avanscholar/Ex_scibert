0,Introduction,"Today, there is a growing demand for application of natural and synthetic biodegradable polymers to minimize environmental concerns (Gómez-Estaca, Gómez-Guillén, Fernández-Martín, & Montero, 2011). In general, a film is described as an independent thin material layer capable of providing mechanical strength to this structure (Hun, 2005; Sabaghi, Maghsoudlou, & Habibi, 2015). Biodegradable films can be developed as food packaging materials to replace synthetic polymers. Biodegradable films are classified into two categories: synthetic (based on petroleum) and green polymers. Polylactic Acid has good processing abilities, such as water resistance, thermal sewing ability and printability in comparison to other biodegradable polymers, however its brittle against mechanical stresses (Sin, 2012). Chitin is a copolymer of N-acetyl d-glucosamine and d-glucosamine units linked by glycosidic bonds, in addition N-acetyl d-glucosamine units are the predominant fragments in the polymer chain. Chitosan is a de-acetylated form of chitin. Currently, chitin and chitosan are fabricated from aquatic organism waste. Chitosan is widely used in the food industry because of its structural properties that make it easy to form film or coating. Edible polymers are widely used in food industry as films or coatings to maintain the quality of food products with physical, functional or both properties. Edible polymers can be used in combination with synthetic biodegradable polymers due to their low mechanical strength and high sensitivity to environmental conditions as a film. The combination of polymers can be suggested for the purpose of producing new polymeric materials for diverse applications. Synthetic biodegradable polymers, such as polyvinyl alcohol with good mechanical strength and non-toxic features can be combined with natural polymers to enhance their mechanical properties (Sabaghi, Maghsoudlou, Habibi, Habibi et al., 2015). Polyvinyl alcohol is a water-soluble synthetic polymer with perfect mechanical properties and a good barrier to gases owing to its dense structure which is widely used in food contact materials. Numerous studies have been undertaken to incorporate natural polymers with polyvinyl alcohol to improve the mechanical properties for instance, polyvinyl alcohol in combination with starch incorporated nano silicon dioxide (Chen, Imam, Gordon, & Greene, 1997), chitosan (Arvanitoyannis, Kolokuris, Nakayama, Yamamoto, & Aiba, 1997), kefiran (Sabaghi, Maghsoudlou, & Habibi, 2015) and balangu seed gum (Maghsoudlou, Sabaghi, & Kashiri, 2019). Considering the physicomechanical properties in combination with these compounds improved the mechanical properties of the final produced films. Chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol are easily miscible due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Chitosan in combination with polyvinyl alcohol is a good substrate for controlled release of bioactive compounds. Moreover, it limits the mobility of intermolecular chains and thus reduces gas permeability that is competitive with synthetic polymers, which is an important aspect in preventing destructive reactions occurring by oxygen as well as the creation of modified atmosphere (Kanatt, Rao, Chawla, & Sharma, 2012). Application of synthetic antioxidants in food products have potential health risks, so researchers endeavor to replace synthetic antioxidants with natural compounds. Phenolic compounds are considered as natural antioxidants (Sabaghi, Maghsoudlou, Khomeiri, & Ziaiifar, 2015). Catechin is the most important polyphenolic compound extracted from tea and its flavonoid revealing significant antioxidant activity (Zhang & Kosaraju, 2007). Tea catechins include epicatechin, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, and epigallocatechin gallate, which have diverse biological activities, such as antioxidant, antibacterial, and antifungal activities (Sabaghi, Maghsoudlou, Khomeiri et al., 2015). The antioxidant activity of catechin is mostly related to the ortho dihydroxyl groups in the β-ring of catechin structure, which has anti-free radical activity (Higdon & Frei, 2003). Application of catechin in various products is limited due to instability under processing conditions (eg. temperature, pH and enzymes) or storage conditions (eg. light and oxygen) (Cai et al., 2018). Nanoencapsulation is a novel method to protect bioactive compounds from peripheral or process factors leading to a controlled release behavior and transfer of core materials to the target site with the help of polymer walls. Application of chitosan for nanoencapsulation of bioactive compounds with respect to its features, such as non-toxicity, biodegradability and environmental compatibility has captured the attention of academia. Extensive research on the application of nanoparticles containing bioactive compounds for the sake of protection and controlled release has been conducted (Harris, Lecumberri, Mateos-Aparicio, Mengíbar, & Heras, 2011). Examples include application of chitosan nanoparticles containing tea polyphenols in gelatin film (Liu et al., 2017) and alpha-tocopherol, nanoencapsulated in polycaprolactone to methyl cellulose film (Noronha, de Carvalho, Lino, & Barreto, 2014) to control its release in food simulant. Among the various methods to produce nanoparticles, ion gelation method is the preferred method for researchers due to the simplicity of process and absence of toxic solvents. In the ion gelation method, the nanoparticle complex is formed between the two groups of positive charges, namely chitosan amines and negative tripolyphosphate charges (Luangtana-anan et al., 2005). When a series of linear chains of a polymer are interconnected from several internal points, this type of interconnection is referred as crosslinking (Oyama, 2014). Crosslinkers improve the physicomechanical properties, thermal resistance and release process of bioactive compounds from the polymer matrix. Chemical or physical cross linkers are used to induce cross-links. Chemical cross linkers due to their high cost or adverse effects can replace physical cross linkers, such as gamma ray irradiation, which are cost-efficient, non-toxic and eco-friendly (Benbettaïeb, Assifaoui, Karbowiak, Debeaufort, & Chambin, 2016; Benbettaïeb, Chambin, Karbowiak, & Debeaufort, 2016; Benbettaïeb, Karbowiak, Brachais, & Debeaufort, 2016; Pal, Paulson, & Rousseau, 2009). Gamma irradiation results in the production of free radicals or chemical species with highly reactive unpaired electrons, the produced free radicals modify crosslinking between the polymer chains, chain cleavage along with the oxidation of the carbon chains. New chemical bonds between atoms of adjacent filaments of the polymer are created as a result of crosslinks, which can alter the chemical and mechanical properties of the polymer (Cassidy, Nesaei, McTaggart, & Delfanian, 2016). The effects of 10–40 kGy gamma radiation on zein film showed that irradiation reduced water vapor permeability compared to the non-irradiated control samples (Soliman, Mohy Eldin, & Furuta, 2009). The irradiation of 40 and 60 KGy electron beams on a mixture of chitosan and gelatin biopolymer with quercetin natural antioxidant, reduced its release in a hydroalcoholic medium (30 % v/v ethanol) at 25 ℃ compared to the untreated control films (Benbettaïeb, Assifaoui et al., 2016, Benbettaïeb, Chambin et al., 2016; Benbettaïeb, Karbowiak et al., 2016). Electron beam irradiation at 60 KGy reduced the rate of release of ferulic acid and tyrosol natural antioxidants from chitosan-gelatin biopolymer in aqueous medium at 25 °C and neutral pH compared to the non-irradiated control films. The irradiation also increased the tensile strength of the film and decreased its permeability (Benbettaïeb, Assifaoui et al., 2016, Benbettaïeb, Chambin et al., 2016; Benbettaïeb, Karbowiak et al., 2016). In this study, the effect of different doses of gamma irradiation on the physicomechanical properties and release of catechin as a natural antioxidant from composite films was investigated. The purpose of this study was to fabricate a bioactive nanocomposite film with desirable functional properties intended for food packaging applications."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials In this study, green tea catechins from chemsavers Company, deionized water from Zolal Company, ethanol (99 %), sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium hydroxide and glycerol from Merck Company, low molecular weight chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol from Sigma Aldrich were purchased."
3,Production of nanoparticles,"2.2 Production of nanoparticles Chitosan crab shell, (DD›0.75) solutions at concentration of 7.5 g L-1 in aqueous solution, was prepared by dissolving chitosan powder in an aqueous solution of glacial acetic acid (1 ml in 100 mL), and polyvinyl alcohol 15 g L-1 in aqueous solution, was prepared by dissolving polyvinyl alcohol powder in distilled water (1 ml in 100 mL) at ratio of Chitosan: Polyvinyl alcohol(1: 3) under stirring conditions at 60 ℃ and then chitosan nanoparticles containing catechin (4 ml in 100 ml) were added. The production of catechin nanoparticles was performed by ionic gelation method. Briefly, chitosan crab shell, (DD›0.75) solutions at concentration of 7.5 g L-1 in aqueous solution, was prepared by dissolving chitosan powder in an aqueous solution of glacial acetic acid (1 ml in 100 mL). pH was adjusted to 4.8 with sodium hydroxide and then catechin at ratio of 1−10 w/w chitosan powder added to chitosan solution while stirring. The magnetic stirrer was employed at 700 rpm and 5 g L-1 sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) as a cross linker agent slowly (every 8 s a drop) 1: 5 v/v chitosan and catechin solution were added. The nanoparticles were separated by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 20 min and rinsed with distilled water and then centrifuged again for 20 min. Later, the average size and zeta potential of nanoparticles were determined (Konecsni, Low, & Nickerson, 2012)."
4,Film production and gamma irradiation,"2.3 Film production and gamma irradiation Chitosan crab shell, (DD›0.75) solutions at concentration of 15 g L-1 in aqueous solution, was prepared by dissolving chitosan powder in an aqueous solution of glacial acetic acid (1 ml in 100 mL), and polyvinyl alcohol 15 g L-1 in aqueous solution, was prepared by dissolving polyvinyl alcohol powder in distilled water (1 ml in 100 mL) at ratio of Chitosan:Polyvinyl alcohol(1:3) under stirred conditions at 60 ℃ w e r e m i x e d and then chitosan nanoparticles containing catechin (4 ml in 100 ml) were added. Glycerol at the ratio of 1–4 dry powder films was added to the film forming solutions as plasticizer and mixed overnight. 65 ml of film-forming solution poured in melamine mold (21 × 14 cm) and dried in an oven at 40 °C. The same amount of film-forming solution was coated on the surface of the polylactic acid (PLA) to produce bilayer films. Gamma irradiation of mono and double layer films at doses of 40 and 60 kGy in Institute for Beam Application (Iranian Atomic Energy Organization) by linear electron accelerator at ambient temperature on films with thickness respectively mono-layer and double-layer 16.36 and 49.36 μm were done. Mono and double layer films without irradiation were considered as control samples. Schematic diagram of the film production is shown in Fig. 1 . 2.3.1 Evaluation of catechin release in different high fat and low fat simulant Evaluation of catechin release was performed at different high-fat and low-fat food simulants. Release in a high-fat simulant was performed according to the method of Chen, Lee, Zhu, and Yam (2012) with slight modifications. Briefly, the films 30 cm2 were immersed in 40 ml hydroalcoholic solution (95 % ethanol) (Chen et al., 2012). Release in low-fat simulant was performed according to the method of Benbettaïeb, Assifaoui et al. (2016); Benbettaïeb, Chambin et al. (2016), Benbettaïeb, Karbowiak et al. (2016) with some modifications. Briefly, films 30 cm2 were immersed in in 40 ml hydroalcoholic solution (30 % ethanol). At each time, 250 μl of sample was removed from the solution and the absorbance was recorded to determine of total phenol at range of 765 nm based on standard curves prepared from different concentrations of catechin (Benbettaïeb, Assifaoui et al., 2016, Benbettaïeb, Chambin et al., 2016; Benbettaïeb, Karbowiak et al., 2016). 2.3.1.1 Modeling of catechin release To investigate the kinetics of catechin release from nanocomposite films in low and high-fat simulants, experimental data was fitted using different equations including Higuchi (C = Kt 0.5), Rigter-Peppas (C = Kt n), Peppas-Sahlin (C = K1 tm +K2 t2m) and Kupcha (C = K1×t 0.5 +K2×t). In these equations, (C) is the concentration of catechin at the time (t), K1 and K2 are the kinetics constants in Peppas-Sahlin and Kupcha equations and m and n are release coefficients. In Kopcha and Peppas-Sahlin equations, K1 and K2 are respectively diffusion and erosion coefficient. In Rigter-Peppas equation, n depends on the geometry of the release, that in this case n = 0.5, indicating Fickian diffusion, 0.5›n›1 indicating non-Fickian transport, and n = 1 indicating Case-II transport. In Higuchi equation, n is the release coefficient, when n = 0.5, indicating diffusion release behavior, 0.5›n›1 indicating both diffusion and erosion release behavior, and n = 1 indicating release in erosion mode. 2.3.1.2 Determination of catechin content by Folin–Ciocalteu method In this method, 250 μl of each solution was mixed with 1250 μl of Folin–Ciocalteu reagent and 1000 μl of sodium carbonate solution 75 g L-1 was added. Test tubes were shaken in a water bath at 40 °C and after 60 min, absorbance was determined by spectrophotometer at 765 nm. Catechin was used to draw the standard curve and results were expressed as mg g-1 (Kodama, Gonçalves, Lajolo, & Genovese, 2010). The standard curve was plotted based on the catechin concentration and standard equation was calculated (y = 0.775x + 0.1396 and R2 = 0.97)."
5,Determine the physical properties of the film,"2.4 Determine the physical properties of the film The film thickness was measured using a digital micrometer (Mituyoto Japan 0.001 mm). Ten measurements were taken from different locations of the films. The moisture content of films (4 cm in diameter) was determined by measuring the film weight loss before and after drying in a laboratory oven at 103 °C until reaching a fixed weight. To evaluate the solubility of films in water, the initial dry matter content of each film was measured. Films were placed in the oven at 103 °C and then the samples (4 cm in diameter) were immersed in 50 ml of distilled water in order to reach a constant weight. Periodic shaking of immersed films was done for 6 h at 25 °C. The remaining pieces of films were collected and dried at 103 °C until a constant weight was obtained to calculate solubility in water. To determine water vapor permeability, first CaCl2 (dried, 103 °C) poured in aluminum cup with a 3.5 cm internal diameter and film samples were paraffin-embedded and placed in a desiccator at %75 RH (saturated NaCl Solution). The weight of cups was measured periodically and moisture transfer rate of films were calculated from the regression slope to obtain the weight and moisture content transferred from films surface until a constant weight was reached (Moisture Changes (g)) / (Surface Area (m2)) × Time Changes(s) and water vapor permeability (slope weight gain (g S-1)) × (Thickness (m) /pressure changes (1753.55 Pa)) of films were calculated (Sabaghi, Maghsoudlou, Habibi, Habibi et al., 2015)."
6,Mechanical properties,"2.5 Mechanical properties Mechanical properties of films (2.5 × 10 cm) were measured using a texture analyzer TA-XT-plus (Stable Micro Systems, Surrey, UK), grip separation was set at 50 mm, with a cross-head speed of 50 mm/min. Tensile strength (MPa) and elongation at break (%) based on input data (Length, width and thickness) were calculated (Sabaghi, Maghsoudlou, Habibi, Habibi et al., 2015)."
7,Fourier transform infrared,"2.6 Fourier transform infrared Fourier transform infrared spectrum in the absorption state was determined by spectrophotometer (Tensor Model II, German Broker company) in the wavelength range of 500 to 4000 cm-1 (Zhang & Kosaraju, 2007)."
8,Thermogravimetric analysis,"2.7 Thermogravimetric analysis Thermal degradation behavior of the films was investigated at a heating rate of 10 °C / min in the nitrogen-containing space at a temperature range of 30–700 °C (León, Lamanna, Gerschenson, & Rojas, 2008)."
9,Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),"2.8 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) The morphology of the films was investigated by SEM. The films were glued to the aluminum holder using a silver adhesive. For better conductivity, the samples were coated with a thin layer of gold (about 5–6 nm thick) for five minutes. Samples were taken at an acceleration voltage of 14 kV and magnification 2000 x."
10,Statistical analysis,"2.9 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed in a factorial design (∝ = 0.05) with SAS software (Version 9.1 Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The graphs were drawn using Excel 2013 software and fitting the experimental data obtained from Catechin release through experimental models with the help of MATLAB 7.10.0 (R2010a) software."
11,Result and discussion,
12,Production of nanoparticles,"3.1 Production of nanoparticles During production of nanoparticles via ion gelation method, gel formation is based on interaction between positive charge amino group of chitosan and negative charge of sodium tripolyphosphate. In sodium tripolyphosphate solution, OH- ions compete with P3O10-5 ions to react with the chitosan amine groups. In the present study, average size of nanoparticles enclosing catechin was 69.92 nm (Fig. 2 a). Zeta potential measurement was performed to determine the surface charge of nanoparticles. The stability of the nanoparticles can be analyzed using the data of zeta potential. In general, the higher charge density of the nanoparticle surface results in repulsive forces between nanoparticles thus preventing aggregation and adhesion of nanoparticles (Zhang & Kosaraju, 2007). The zeta potential of nanoparticles was +30.3 mV (Fig. 2b), indicating the presence of amino group of chitosan at nanoparticle surface (Harris et al., 2011)."
13,Physical properties of nanocomposite films,"3.2 Physical properties of nanocomposite films The film thickness is affected by nature as well as the composition of the film (Abugoch, Tapia, Villamán, Yazdani-Pedram, & Díaz-Dosque, 2011). As can be seen in Fig. 3 a, gamma irradiation decreased the thickness of the monolayer and double layer films, respectively from 16.36 to 14.6 and 49.36–44.6 μm. Cheng et al. (2019) used the microbial transglutaminase enzyme as a cross linker to improve structural properties of collagen films. The thickness of the collagen film was decreased due to the formation of a compact structure (Cheng et al., 2019). As cross-section SEM images (Fig. 4 ) demonstrated, the gamma irradiation dose of 60 kGy decreased the interlayer distance and increased the adhesion between two layers. Generally, gamma irradiation at different doses had no significant effect (P < 0.05) on the thickness of mono and double layer films. As shown in Fig. 3b, the solubility in water was significantly (P < 0.05) affected by the high dose of irradiation. Treating the film with gamma ray, 60 kGy reduced the water solubility due to its more compact structure than the control sample and 40 kGy gamma irradiation. Similarly, solubility in water of collagen film and mixing gelatin and soy protein isolate film was affected by microbial glutaminase enzyme due to crosslinking, tighter structure and reducing intermolecular space (Cheng et al., 2019; Weng & Zheng, 2015). The results showed that by increasing the radiation dose to 60 kGy, water vapor permeability of composite films was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced (Fig. 5 ). High permeability to water vapor is one of the major challenges in using films as food packaging agents. Application of gamma irradiation as a physical cross linker at relatively high doses is a practical way to lower moisture transfer rate between food and external environment (de Moura et al., 2009). Jipa et al. (2012) reported that, 50 kGy dose of gamma radiation reduced water vapor permeability mixture of polyvinyl alcohol and bacterial cellulose, but this effect was not significant (Jipa et al., 2012). In the present study, dose of gamma radiation up to 40 kGy had no significant effect (P < 0.05) on water vapor permeability of films, but 60 kGy gamma dose had a dramatic effect (P < 0.05). According to results of this study, Lee, Lee, and Song (2005) investigated the effect of different doses of 0–50 kGy gamma irradiation on gluten film, 50kGy dose reduced water vapor permeability by 29 % compared to non-irradiated control film (Lee et al., 2005). Benbettaïeb, Assifaoui et al. (2016), study the effect of 60kGy radiation dose at three different low, medium and high relative humidity on water vapor permeability of chitosan and gelatin complex films containing natural antioxidants ferulic acid, quercetin and tyrosol, according to the present study conditions, in moderate humidity gamma irradiation treatment reduced the water vapor permeability of the films. Gamma irradiation generated a dense structure and thus reduced water vapor transfer rate from nanocomposite films (Benbettaïeb, Assifaoui et al., 2016, Benbettaïeb, Chambin et al., 2016; Benbettaïeb, Karbowiak et al., 2016)."
14,Mechanical properties of nanocomposite films,"3.3 Mechanical properties of nanocomposite films Film produced for the purpose of food packaging requires mechanical resistance to all kinds of stresses from storage period to consumption (Tang, Alavi, & Herald, 2008). The effect of different doses of gamma irradiation on tensile strength and elongation at break in order to determine the mechanical properties of chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol composite films with chitosan nanoparticles containing catechin as monolayer and bilayer on the surface of PLA was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 6 a, in monolayer and bilayer films, gamma irradiation up to 40 kGy had no striking impact (P < 0.05) on the tensile strength of the films, but the elevation of gamma radiation dose to 60 kGy dramatically (P < 0.05) increased tensile strength of composite films. 60 kGy gamma irradiation increased tensile strength in monolayer and bilayer control samples without irradiation, from 9.69 ± 0.94 and 12.62 ± 0.72–12.36 ± 1.1 and 14.92 ± 0.95 MPa. In monolayer films gamma irradiation up to 40 kGy, had no significant effect (P < 0.05) on elongation at break of composite films (Fig. 6b), but increasing the gamma irradiation dose to 60 kGy caused a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in elongation at break from 73.31 3 ± 3.81 % (non-irradiated), to 65.98 ± 1.75 % in 60 kGy gamma irradiation. A decreasing trend was also observed in bilayer samples, but in general, different doses of radiation had no significant effect (P < 0.05) on elongation at break of bilayer films (Fig. 6b). Lee et al. (2005) investigated the effect of different doses of 0–50 kGy gamma irradiation on gluten film. The 50kGy dose gamma ray increased the tensile strength 1.5 times. Elongation at break was decreased by enhancing the radiation dose (Lee et al., 2005). Perkasa, Erizal, Darmawan, and Rasyid (2013) explored the effect of different doses of 0–50 kGy gamma ray on fish gelatin film. Different doses of gamma ray increased the tensile strength, but this effect was not considerable. Furthermore, the percentage of elongation at break did not change with increasing radiation dose (Perkasa et al., 2013). Increase in tensile strength is contributed to crosslinking and restriction of the polymer chain mobility (Benbettaïeb, Assifaoui et al., 2016, Benbettaïeb, Chambin et al., 2016; Benbettaïeb, Karbowiak et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2005; Perkasa et al., 2013). As shown in Fig. 6, PLA unaided has poor mechanical properties (Sin, 2012). Tensile strength (Fig. 6a) and elongation at break (Fig. 6b) of PLA film were 7.93 ± 0.41 MPa and 18.12 ± 1.57 %, respectively. The results of bilayer samples showed that the coating of this polymer with a mixture of polyvinyl alcohol and chitosan incorporating nanoparticles with and without irradiation improves the mechanical properties of the PLA. Generally, coating polylactic acid with a mixture of polyvinyl alcohol and chitosan with and without irradiation had a synergistic effect compared to the monolayers and PLA samples."
15,Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),"3.4 Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) FTIR results for catechin powder, chitosan nanoparticles containing catechin, chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol film, chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol film containing nanoparticles, and chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol film containing nanoparticles gamma irradiated 60 kGy are shown in Fig. 7 . Peaks of 1510–1570 Cm-1 are related to amide II and peaks of 1658 and 1322 Cm-1 are related to amides I and III in chitosan, respectively. The variation in these peaks in chitosan nanoparticles containing catechin is due to minor interactions between OH catechin groups and amide groups having crosslinking in chitosan (Zhang & Kosaraju, 2007). Interaction between chitosan and catechin resulted in a peak shift (CONH2) in the particles containing catechin. In the composite film of chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol without nanoparticles, peaks around 1630 Cm-1 indicate NH bonds due to the presence of amino chitosan groups. The peaks around 1385 and 1483 Cm-1 are attributed to the stretching of CH, CH2 and CH3 groups. Peaks of 1253 to 1269 Cm-1 are related to the strong stretching of amines. In the mixture of chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol-containing nanoparticles band around 3472 Cm-1 is attributed to the vibrational stretching of the amino and amide groups in the chitosan which is shifted to the wavenumber of 3410 Cm-1 due to the strong interaction between film-forming mixture and nanoparticles. The absorption bands at 673 and 871 Cm-1 are related to the elongation of the amide groups due to the presence of chitosan nanoparticles (Kanatt et al., 2012; Parida, Nayak, Binhani, & Nayak, 2011). The radiation generally decreased the intensity of bands at 1322 and 3410 Cm-1 and caused shift 17 and 14 Cm-1 to higher wavenumbers, which belong to amino and amide groups of chitosan. Overall, FTIR results showed interaction between film mixture and chitosan nanoparticles containing catechin and gamma irradiation resulted in changes in the peaks."
16,Thermogravimetric analysis of nanocomposite films,"3.5 Thermogravimetric analysis of nanocomposite films modifications of polymer properties are visible through thermogravimetric analysis (Ramnani, Chaudhari, Patil, & Sabharwal, 2004). Thermogravimetric analysis of nancomposite films is shown in Fig. 8 . According to thermograms, thermal degradation of nanocomposites occurs in three main stages (García, Ribba, Dufresne, Aranguren, & Goyanes, 2011). In the early stages of thermal process, weight loss was lower in irradiated samples compared to control sample. In general, weight loss at the first stage of thermal process is due to removal of moisture and other volatile compounds. At the second stage, thermal degradation began, with thermal degradation at 285 °C in non-irradiated control film and irradiated film (60 kGy), which was 43 and 52 % initial weight, respectively. The weight loss is due to evaporation of plasticizer present in film structure (González, Retegi, González, Eceiza, & Gabilondo, 2015). The terminal phase of thermal degradation occurred at 345 °C. Weight loss at this stage in the non-irradiated control film and irradiated film (60 kGy) was about 26 and 41 % initial weight, respectively. Previous studies demonstrated that the application of chemical crosslinkers slightly increased the glass transition temperature in edible films (Akin & Hasirci, 1995; Patil, Mark, Apostolov, Vassileva, & Fakirov, 2000; Peña, De La Caba, Eceiza, Ruseckaite, & Mondragon, 2010). According to this study, Perkasa et al. (2013) investigated the effect of different doses of 0–50 kGy gamma irradiation on thermal stability of fish gelatin film. Their results showed different doses of gamma ray caused a slight increase glass transition temperature of fish gelatin film (Perkasa et al., 2013). The weight loss at this stage is contributed to depolymerization of polymer chains. All in all, results showed that 60 kGy gamma dose compared to the control film without irradiation was effective on the thermal stability of nanocomposite films."
17,Release kinetics in food simulants (low-fat and high-fat),"3.6 Release kinetics in food simulants (low-fat and high-fat) Fig. 9 a shows release rate of catechin from composite film in the low-fat food simulant (30 % ethanol) at 37 °C. In control sample, there was a sudden release after 72 h in which release of catechin increased from 26.22–47.09 % of total catechin and after 144 h, 87.4 % of total catechin was released from film structure. Similar to control sample 40kGy gamma-irradiated films had a sudden release rate from 27.56 to 39.75 % of total catechin after 72 h. Finally, after 168 h, 87.4 % of total catechin was released from the film structure. Samples irradiated at 60kGy gamma dose, the release process proceeded with a slight pace up to 144 h, but then there was a 28.72 % increase in the release slope and 85.31 % of total catechin was released after 192 h. Generally, these results showed that 60 kGy gamma irradiation, decreased the release rate over time in low fat food simulant medium compared to the non-irradiated control film. Benbettaïeb, Assifaoui et al. (2016), Benbettaïeb, Chambin et al. (2016), Benbettaïeb, Karbowiak et al. (2016) investigated the effect of 60 kGy gamma irradiation dose on release rate of ferulic acid and tyrosol from film mixture of gelatin and chitosan. Release data in aqueous medium with neutral pH showed that irradiation retards release for bioactive compounds especially ferulic acid release due to the lower diffusion coefficient compared to tyrosol (Benbettaïeb, Assifaoui et al., 2016, Benbettaïeb, Chambin et al., 2016; Benbettaïeb, Karbowiak et al., 2016). Benbettaïeb, Assifaoui et al. (2016), Benbettaïeb, Chambin et al. (2016), Benbettaïeb, Karbowiak et al. (2016) investigated the effect of different doses of gamma irradiation on quercetin release rate from a mixture of gelatin and chitosan film. The results of quercetin release in 30 % ethanol indicated that irradiation caused controlled release of quercetin from film matrix due to possible cross-linking between bioactive material and polymer matrix (Benbettaïeb, Assifaoui et al., 2016, Benbettaïeb, Chambin et al., 2016; Benbettaïeb, Karbowiak et al., 2016). Fig. 9b shows the amount of catechin release from nanocomposite film in high-fat simulant medium (95 % ethanol) at 37 °C. In control sample, there was a sudden release after 408 h from 52.25–80.98 % of total catechin and 80.54 % of total catechin after 456 h was released. Samples treated at the dose of 40 kGy gamma irradiation had similar trend control sample from 57.81 to 77.97 % after 408 h and 76.65 % of total catechin after 456 h was released. Films irradiated at 60 kGy gamma dose, showed a gradual release process to 480 h, but suddenly increased from 30.65 to 50.84 % of total catechin. To conclude, the results showed that high-dose gamma irradiation similar to low fat simulant media, reduced release degree and increased 120 h release period in high fat simulant media compared to non-irradiated control films. Release results of chitosan nanoparticles containing tea polyphenols mixed with gelatin film in 50 % and 95 % ethanol lipid simulant medium showed that release of polyphenolic compounds in 50%–95% medium was faster due to a two-fold increase in diffusion coefficient (Liu et al., 2017). Release results of methylcellulose film containing nanoencapsulated alpha-tocopherol to polycaprolactone in 95 % lipid simulant showed after 24 h due to swelling films and penetration of water ascending slope release was observed (Noronha et al., 2014). Release of limonene in chitosan film enriched with bergamot oil in food simulant 0–95 % ethanol showed that its release was gradual and faster by increasing alcohol percent due to non-polar nature of limonene (Sánchez-González, Cháfer, González-Martínez, Chiralt, & Desobry, 2011). In order to select the best model of catechin release from composite film in 30 % ethanol medium, Higuchi, Rigter-Pepas, Peppas-Sahlin and Kupcha equations were selected. In order to find the best model with the highest correlation coefficient and the lowest degree of free of error, the coefficient R2/RMSE was considered. Thus, in low fat simulant medium Kupcha equation with highest R2/RMSE was selected as the best model to fitting release data (Fig. 10 a). In low-fat food simulant at different doses of irradiation 0, 40 and 60 kGy, K2 is always greater than K1. The values of K1 were -0.04, -0.01 and -0.051, and K2 values were 0.01, 0.007 and 0.008, respectively, indicating the mechanism of release is due to degradation composite film and nanoparticle structure and thus catechin release. In order to select the best catechin release model for the nanocomposite films in high-fat medium (95 % ethanol), Higuchi, Rigter-Peppas, Peppas-Sahlin and Kupcha equations, were chosen. In order to find the best model with the highest correlation coefficient and the lowest degree of freedom, the coefficient R2/RMSE was considered. The Rigter-pappas model with the highest R2/RMSE was selected as the best model for the data of 0 and 40 kGy and Kupcha model for 60 kGy gamma irradiation samples respectively, and release data were fitted on these models (Fig. 10b). At doses of 0 and 40 kGy n were 0.747 and 0.721, respectively, where 0.5 ›n› 1 indicates anomalous release. At dose of 60 kGy, K1 and K2 were -0.02 and 0.02, respectively (K2›K1), indicating the mechanism of release corresponds to degradation of composite film and nanoparticle structure and thus catechin release."
18,Conclusion,"In the present study, chitosan nanoparticles containing catechin as a natural antioxidant were added to mixture of chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol film, which was coated on the surface of polylactic acid. Films were then exposed to different doses of gamma ray as a physical cross linker to improve its physico-mechanical properties and induction of controlled release. The results of this study indicated that high dose irradiation (60 Kgy) improved the adhesion between two film layers, in addition it caused change in physico-mechanical properties of films. Overall, results showed that the release trend of catechin from nanocomposite films in high-fat food simulant was slower than low-fat food simulant. Besides, release from polymer matrix depends on several factors, such as film structure, solvent type, polarity, which in present study polarity difference in the two simulant media was the most important factor affecting its release rate. Radiation, especially, 60kGy dose, was effective in controlling release of catechin due to the formation of new crosslinks in the polymer matrix. Based on the results of the present study, 60 KGy irradiated double layer film with desirable characteristics can be used as a film with thermal stitching and printing in outer layer and internal active layer with time-controlled release of catechin as a naturally-occurring antioxidant for packaging foods sensitive to oxidation."
