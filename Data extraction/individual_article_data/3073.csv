0,Introduction,"Biofilm attachment process is considered as a high-efficient technology for hydrogen production by photosynthetic bacterial (PSB). The biofilm photobioreactor, therefore, has attracted intensive attention due to its promising advantages, including high concentration of biomass, avoidance of biomass-liquid separation, high light utilization efficiency and dual functions of further wastewater biodegradation and hydrogen production [1]. Support material plays an important role in the biofilm attachment process and then directly affects the bioreactor performance. The physicochemical properties of the support material, such as surface energy, hydrophilicity, composition, charge and roughness, will significantly impact on cell adhesion, biofilm growth and activity. In the past decades, the effects of physicochemical properties of the support materials on the bioprocesses have been comparatively studied. Habouzit et al. [2] reported that the start-up of biofilm processes and the bioreactors performance were dependent on the surface energy of the support materials as it determined the adhered cell numbers. Bayoudh et al. [3] discovered that the hydrophilic bacteria were easily adsorbed on the hydrophilic surface. Zhao et al. [4] showed that the cell retention capacity and the biofilm adhesion strength were directly affected by the surface morphology. Especially, bacteria preferentially adhered to the grooves that conform to their size since the appropriate surface grooves can increase contact area to the cells [5]. Ginsburg et al. [6] discovered that the compositions of the support material also had an impact on cell adhesion, and the SiO2 modified material can enhance the cell adhesion capacity. Furthermore, Fang et al. [7] discovered that surface charge also impacted on the bacterial adhesion and the positive charge was conducive to the cells adsorption than the negative charge. However, most of the research works individually investigated the effects of these parameters on the bioprocesses, because it is difficult for the existed commercial materials to obtain the comprehensive properties like roughness, nutrients, hydrophilic and positively charged groups. The chemical modification of the support materials is one of promising ways to not only increase the cell adhesion capacity but also improve biofilm activity and decrease the sensitivity to environmental parameters [8]. Chitosan has been employed as modifier for cell immobilization during the last 15 years [9–13]. Chitosan is the most abundant renewable polysaccharides deriving from chitin, and the major component of crustacean shells features organic biocompatibility and adaptability [14]. The modified support material by chitosan Sol can adsorb proteins and cell culture, furthermore, it has shown the excellent performance on promoting the growth of cells, such as hydrophilic, transmittance, positively charged [15–17]. In the present study, a high-quality support material, named as SiO2-Chitosan-Medium Sol, is fabricated by organic–inorganic hybrid technology. The material properties are compared with other four materials in terms of topography, surface energy and composition. Their biological compatibilities and the initial Rhodoseudomonas palustris CQK 01 cell adhesion capacities are assayed. In addition, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and average H2 production rates of the biofilms are investigated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals The chitosan with a degree of acetylation of 85% and a high molecular weight of 1.0 × 106–3.0 × 106 was used. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was the electronic grade. Bovine albumin (BSA) was used as the guaranteed reagent. Other chemical reagents: diiodomethane, ethylene glycol, phenol etc. were chosen as the analytical grade reagents. The Ultra-hydrophobe Sol (Fluorinated copolymer latex) was purchased from Hangzhou Asahi Ran Co., Ltd. China."
3,Support material description,"2.2 Support material description 2.2.1 Preparation of Sol and support material A 1.5% (w/v) chitosan-acetate Sol was prepared by using the chitosan and acetic acid solution (0.5 mol L−1). Prior to immobilization, the pH of the chitosan Sol was adjusted to the range of 4–4.5 in order to avoid cell damage [8,9]. The SiO2 Sol was obtained by adding dropwise 8 ml ammonia solution (0.45 mol L−1) into the mixture solution of 26.7 ml TEOS and 190 ml absolute ethyl alcohol. The culture medium was from the 200-fold concentration of the synthetic medium which was the same as our previous work [1]. Furthermore, the temperature of 40 °C and the ultrasonic agitation (20 Hz, 180 W) were served as the dispersion conditions. The SiO2-Chitosan Sol was prepared from 1 g SiO2 Sol and 9 g chitosan-acetate Sol mixtures. The SiO2-Chitosan-Medium Sol was obtained from 0.5 g supernatant of the culture medium and 5 g SiO2-Chitosan Sol mixtures. The prepared Sols (Chitosan-acetate Sol, SiO2-Chitosan Sol, SiO2-Chitosan-Medium Sol and Ultra-hydrophobic Sol) were distributed on the thoroughly washed slides (25.4 × 76.2 mm) using an airbrush with a nozzle of 0.3 mm (GP-101A, Taiwan) at 2 MPa. The coated slides were vacuum dried 240 min at 85 °C, the weights of the coated slides and the uncoated slides were weighted using a balance (SartoriusCPA225D, Germany). Then, the microscope slides (MS), coated ultra-hydrophobic slides (HS), coated chitosan-acetate slides (CS), coated SiO2-Chitosan slides (CSS) and coated SiO2-Chitosan-medium slides (CSSM) were stored in a dry sterile container. 2.2.2 Surface energy The surface energy of the support materials was determined using contact angle measurement, and the energy is seen as the sum of a Lifshitz-van der Waals apolar component γ S LW and a Lewis acid-base polar component γ S AB : (1) γ S = γ S LW + γ S AB where γ S is the surface energy of a support material. The acid–base polar component γ S AB can be further divided into an electron donor ( γ S − ) and an electron acceptor ( γ S + ) subcomponent: (2) γ S AB = 2 γ S + γ S − A relation between the measured contact angle and the solid and liquid surface free energy terms was obtained based on Young's equation [2]: (3) γ L ⋅ ( 1 + cos θ ) = 2 ( γ S LW γ L LW + γ S + γ L − + γ S − γ L + ) where γ L is the known surface tension of the liquid, θ is the contact angle, and subscript S and L refer, respectively, to the material surface and liquid. To determine the three surface free energy components ( γ S LW , γ S + and γ S − ) of a support material, according to the contact angle measurement method, three types liquid including deionized water, ethylene glycol and diiodomethane were adopted [18]. Contact angles of the three liquids on the support materials were measured by the sessile drop method. 2.2.3 Composition The surface compositions of the support materials were qualitatively analyzed using the FT-IR spectroscopy method. The functional groups of these materials were recorded on an IR spectrophotometer (Nicolet iN10, Thermofisher, USA) with the resolution of 0.5 cm−1 in the range of 400–13000 cm−1."
4,Microbial adhesion and biofilm growth,"2.3 Microbial adhesion and biofilm growth 2.3.1 Microorganism and cultivation R. palustris CQK 01 (PSB) strain was employed for photoheterotrophic hydrogen production in this work. The cells were cultivated anaerobically by argon gas at 30 °C for 96 h under illumination from a light emitting diode (LED) emitting at 590 nm and 4000 lx. The initial pH value of the medium before incubation was adjusted to 7.1 using NaOH. 2.3.2 BPBR system The experimental system, as shown in Fig. 1 , consisted of five biofilm photobioreactors (BPBRs) with different support materials, a combined light source, a peristaltic pump, a constant-temperature bath, five substrate medium flasks, five liquid effluent flasks and five gas collectors. The BPBR was a rectangular polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) vessel with working volume of 100 × 50 × 10 mm3 (50 ml). To focus on the effectiveness of the promoted support materials as favorite adhesion sites for PSB, the slide with different support materials was set as a side wall of the BPBR (perpendicular to the horizontal plane) to ignore the effect of gravity settling of cells on the biofilm formation during all the experiments. The external light (fluorescent lamp) was mounted in front of the BPBRs, and illumination intensity was adjusted to 4000 lx. The flow rate of the synthetic medium was 228 ml/h, the temperature of the influent medium was 25 °C. Prior to the experiments, the system was washed with 75% ethanol solution for 15 min and then thoroughly washed with deionized water. 2.3.3 Biocompatibility, adhesion and biofilm growth To investigate the biocompatibility of the support materials, the five materials were immersed in the bacterial suspension (the optical density OD600nm is 0.08), respectively. The cells had been deliberately starved by not refreshing the synthetic medium for 16 days at 25 °C, and then the surface morphologies of the support materials with adhered cells were checked using an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM). Thereafter, the BPBRs were operated in two stages. The first stage was the initial adhesion step, and the adsorption capacity of the materials to the cells was investigated during this stage. The other stage was undertaken to form a biofilm, and the hydrogen production performance of the bioreactors was studied during this stage. The medium (50 ml) was refreshed every day to the bioreactors."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods 2.4.1 Image analysis Prior to an analysis of adhered cell numbers, the substrate squares were stained with Trypan Blue Staining Cell Viability Assay (Beyotime, Haimen, China) for better image contrast. Direct bacterial counts were done using an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX81, Olympus, Japan) at a magnification 400×. For each surface analyzed, 30 pictures covering the entire surface were taken. Each image was then analyzed using automated enumeration software, for determining the number of bacteria attached. 2.4.2 Biofilm dry-weight determination In the experiment, the support materials with biofilms were washed 3 times by the PBS with pH 7.2 to eliminate non-fixed biomass, and then they were dried at 85 °C to constant weight. The biofilm dry-weights were obtained by comparing the dry-weight of the support slides covered by biofilm with that uncovered by biofilm. 2.4.3 Polysaccharide and protein assays The polysaccharides contents in the EPSs were assayed by the phenol-sulfuric acid method using glucose as standard [19], and the proteins in the EPSs were analyzed by the method of Lowry using bovine serum albumin as standard [20]. 2.4.4 Hydrogen production performance The composition of the biogas was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC) (Chongqing, China, SC-2000). The average H2 production rate (R a ) was used to assess the performance of the biofilms and R a is defined as: (4) R a = Amount of H 2 produced ( mmol ) H 2 evolution time ( h ) ×Support material surface area ( m 2 )"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Properties of the support materials,"3.1 Properties of the support materials 3.1.1 Surface morphology From the image analysis, it was found that three support materials, MS, HS and CS, showed similarly smooth surface as Fig. 2 (a–c). However, other two support materials, CSS and CSSM, showed rough surface as Fig. 2(d and e). The roughness was from the hybridization reaction of SiO2 and chitosan, meanwhile, the structure can be stably maintained in weak acid/base solution with a pH range of 2.5–8.0. Furthermore, after the cell had been starved for 16 days, compared with the material MS (cf. Fig. 2f), the CSSM material surface morphology changed to a porous structure, as shown in Fig. 2g and h. This change is attributed to the synthetic medium containing in the CSSM which is vulnerable to the cells in the stressful nutrition condition. Furthermore, the adhered cells showed a normal size with average length of 1.68 μm and diameter of 0.87 μm, respectively, while the cells on the MS were significantly shrunk. These facts reveal that the support material CSSM is biocompatible and nontoxic, the medium in the material is as a part of nutrition to maintain the normal growth of the cells. 3.1.2 Surface energy Contact angles of the distilled water (θ W ), ethylene glycol (θ E ) and diiodomethane (θ D ) on the surfaces of various support materials and the corresponding surface energy components are shown in Table 1 . One can see that the components (surface energy γ S , Lifshitz–Van der γ S LW and the acid-base polar component γ S AB ) of the material (HS) are higher than other four materials. The γ S of the materials CS, CSS and CSSM significantly decreased as compared with the unmodified material MS. Especially, the γ S of samples CS, CSS and CSSM is less than many organic materials which is equal to 40 mJ m−2. These characteristics are favorable to the cell adsorption on the materials [21]. In addition, the difference in the surface energy ( γ S ) between the CSS and CSSM can be attributed to the different chemical compositions in the coated materials. 3.1.3 Infrared characterization of support materials The IR spectra of three support materials, CS, CSS and CSSM are shown in Fig. 3 (the IR spectra of the material HS was reported in the literature [22]). One can see that the characteristically strong and broad overlapping bands near 3450 cm−1 was presented, which corresponds to the stretching vibration of N–H and O–H. The C–H stretching vibration of methyl and methylene groups was observed in the range of 2935–2910 cm−1 and 1420–1400 cm−1, respectively. Particularly, the three modified materials introduced positively charged group (amine group), and the characteristic absorption bands of the group was near 1600 cm−1. These results show that the materials contain chitosan. Furthermore, compared with material CS (curve a), the absorption bands of the monomer at 1151 cm−1 (C–O stretching vibrations) and 1036 cm−1 (C–O–C stretching vibration) disappeared for materials CSS and CSSM (curves b and c). A strong and broad absorption band appeared at near 1080 cm−1 as the overlapping of the new bands of Si–O–Si asymmetric stretching at 1130–1000 cm−1 and Si–O–C stretching at 1100–1050 cm−1 [23]. Based on the materials CS and CSS (curves a and b), the new bands at 2334 cm−1, 1632 cm−1 and 773 cm−1 (curve c) were exposed for the modified material CSSM contains glucose. The CO stretching band (from CO(H2N)2) occurred in the range of 1710–1705 cm−1. The PO 4 3 − inorganic molecule stretching band (from KH2PO4 and K2HPO4·3H2O) occurred at 567 cm−1. These results revealed that the modified material CSSM contained nutrient medium."
8,Microbial adhesion and biofilm growth,"3.2 Microbial adhesion and biofilm growth 3.2.1 Adhesion level After adsorption for 30 min and 60 min, the adhesion density from the experimental observations is presented in Fig. 4 . All the data were repeated at least three times. We can see that the adhesion capacity of the material CS is higher than that of MS and HS. The fact can be attributed to the differences in the surface functional groups, that is, the positively charged group (amine group) is favorable to the cell adhesion. Furthermore, the number of adhered PSB cells on the material CSS was higher than that on the material CS. This is because the material CSS contains component SiO2 resulting in the increase in the roughness of the material surface, hence improving the bacterial retention capacity. Compared material CSSM with CSS, one can observed that the cells adhesion density of the material CSSM surfaces presented a further increase. This improved adhesion capacity of the CSSM is owing to the synthetic medium containing in the material CSSM. As a consequence, after 60 min adsorption, the adhesion density on the CSSM was about 7.3 times, 7.1 times, 1.8 times and 0.4 times higher than that on the materials HS, MS, CS and CSS, respectively. 3.2.2 Biofilm growth The biofilm dry-weights determinations were performed during the biofilm growth process and the results are showed in Fig. 5 . For anyone support material, the biofilm dry-weights increased as time progressed and then tended to a stable value, which evinces a biofilm formation process by the adhered PSB cells. It is noted that the biofilm on the materials MS and HS approached the stable state at about 12 days, while, the stabilization time for the biofilm on the materials CSSM was shortened to 8 days. This is because CSSM showed the favorable properties for cells, like roughness, nutrients and amine group. Furthermore, the biofilm dry-weight on the material CS is 3.5 times and 8.2 times higher than that on the MS and HS during the first 4 days, respectively. This is because the positively charged functional groups (amine group) cause a strong interaction between the material and the negatively charged cells. Whereas, the biofilm dry-weight on CS was only slightly heavier than that on MS and HS after 12 days due to the disappearing interaction between the material and the outer cells and the occurrence of dynamic adsorption-desorption process. The biofilm dry-weight on CSS kept 0.2 times higher than that on CS during most the biofilm formation process. This can be attributed to the surface pits which can promote the cells adhesion and protect cells away from the detachment. Furthermore, the biofilm dry-weight on CSSM maintained at 0.4 times higher than that on CSS after 12 days owing to the culture medium in CSSM. In general, among all the prepared support materials, the biofilm dry-weight on CSSM was the highest. This is a result of comprehensive effect of three aspects: the amine group enhances initial cells adhesion capacity; roughness offers the opportunity to biofilm formation and stabilization; the solid medium in CSSM provides the living condition to the growth of biofilm. The biofilm dry-weight on the material HS got the lowest value due to the difficulties for the ultra-hydrophobic surface in keeping the liquid culture medium for the cells adhesion and growth on the surface. 3.2.3 Proteins and polysaccharides in biofilm Sun et al. [24] and Yu et al. [25] discovered that the EPS components significantly impact on the cell adhesion capacity, metabolic pathways, and biofilm formation and stabilization time. In this work, the proteins, polysaccharides and their accumulations were assayed for the duplicate experiments, and the average values are showed in Table 1. It is found that, except the support material HS, the EPS content gradually increased as the modification was further comprehensivist. The EPS content in the biofilm on the materials CS, CSS and CSSM was 1 times, 1.33 times and 2.33 times higher than that on the material MS, respectively, which was right corresponding to the variation of the biofilm dry-weight on the materials (cf. Fig. 5). Meanwhile, it is also noted that the increased EPS content in the biofilm on the material CSSM mostly profited from the contribution of the protein content, which was 7.5 times higher than the protein content in the biofilm on the material MS. The percentage of polysaccharide in the EPS of the biofilm on CSSM, which had the same value as that on CS and CSS, was even 25% lower than that on MS. These results showed that the adhered cells produced more polysaccharide than protein when the cell adhered and grew on uncomfortable material. As the chitosan was introduced, the adhesion condition was improved due to the positively charged functional groups (amine group), leading to the decrease in the produced polysaccharide and increase in the produced protein. However, the further improvement of the adhesion and growth condition due to the introduction of SiO2 and culture medium did not result in further decrease in the produced polysaccharide but significant increase in the produced protein. Therefore, it can be concluded that the functional groups on the support material plays an important role in determining the component content in the EPS of the biofilm."
9,Hydrogen production performance of biofilm,"3.3 Hydrogen production performance of biofilm The hydrogen production rates of the bioreactors with different support materials were comparatively studied. The average H2 production rates (R a ), which were from the average of the parallel experiments, are showed in the Table 1. One can see that, as the chitosan was coated, the average H2 production rate of the bioreactor with CS was significantly improved by 52% compared with that with MS. The introduced SiO2 brought other 5% improvement to the R a of the bioreactor with CSS, and the introduction of culture medium gave rise to further 13% improvement for the R a of the bioreactor with CSSM. Therefore, it reveals that the amine group and the culture medium are the major factors to increase the average H2 production rate of the biofilms. As analyzed above, the amine group induces an interaction between the support material and cells and results in high biomass, hence significant improvement on the hydrogen production. For the introduction of SiO2, although the induced roughness also benefits the cells adhesion, the surface roughness loses its advantage to improve the biomass when the material surface pits are coated with the cells. That is why it results in slight improvement of the biomass and hydrogen production. For the introduction of the culture medium, it not only benefits the initial cells adhesion but also benefits to the activity and hydrogen production of the cells at the bottom of the biofilm. One can recall that the good initial adhesion condition provided by the support material CSSM results in high biomass and EPS, hence thick biofilm. High mass transfer resistance is presented due to the thick biofilm and then will go against the growth and activity of cells at the bottom of the biofilm. Just then the part of nutrient is supplied to these cells by the solid medium in the support material CSSM. As a result, the average H2 production rate of the bioreactor with CSSM showed the highest value (4.59 mmol/h/m2), and the R a was improved by 80%, 130%, 18% and 13% compared with the rate of the bioreactors with the materials MS, HS, CS and CSS, respectively. As discussed above, the experimental results showed that the functional groups, surface roughness and the compositions of the support material are the favorable factors to the biofilm formation and hence hydrogen production. These factors can increase the cells adsorption, protect biofilm from detachment, provide a part of nutrients to the biofilm and promote biofilm growth. Thus, the support material CSSM is a new valuable material that can optimize the hydrogen production performance of the photobioreactor."
10,Conclusions,"The physicochemical properties of the support material significantly impact on the initial cell retention capacity, biofilm growth and activity. For the different support materials, the adhered cell numbers, the biofilm dry-weights and the biofilm formation time were quite different. The protein and polysaccharide content in the EPS of the biofilm showed a disproportionate increase compared with the biofilm dry-weights. The hydrogen production performances were also different for the five support materials. A good cell adhesion capacity, well biofilm growth and high average H2 production rate were observed in the bioprocesses using the new biocompatible material CSSM due to its properties like amine group, roughness structure and nutrients."
