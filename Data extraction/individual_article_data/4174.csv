0,Introduction,"Searching and optimizing highly efficient photocatalysts has attracted worldwide attention owing to their potential applications in solar energy conversion for solving global energy and environmental problems [1,2]. Among various heterogeneous inorganic and organic semiconductors exploited for photocatalytic hydrogen generation [3,4], metal-free graphitic carbon nitride (generally termed as g-C3N4 for simplicity) with a two-dimensional conjugated structure has stimulated intensive research in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution owing to its earth abundance, environmental friendliness, chemical stability, ease of modification, and suitable thermodynamical potentials to provide abundant capability for water redox reactions [5–9]. However, the high recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs largely restricts the photocatalytic efficiency of g-C3N4 [10–14]. To effectively accelerate the charge carriers separation and enhance the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4, different strategies, including thermodynamic (such as doping with heteroatoms [15–19], engineering defects with nitrogen vacancies or carbon vacancies [20,21], and so on) and kinetic (such as compositing with other semiconductors [22–27], morphology design [28–33], loading cocatalysts [34–37], and so on) modifications have been emerged. All these strategies have rendered great enhancement in the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution over g-C3N4. In particular, compositing g-C3N4 with conductive materials (CMs), an effective strategy without destroying the crystal structure of material, has been widely investigated [38–41] because of its numerous advantages, such as convenient operation, mild reaction condition, and economic cost. Important examples include carbon-based nanostructured materials such as carbon nanotubes [38], carbon quantum dots [39], graphene [40], and the latest MXene [41]. In all these composite systems, the enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity has been associated with the charge transfer process accelerated between g-C3N4 and the CM, which reduces the unfavorable recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs by trapping photogenerated electrons to facilitate electron transfer and charge separation. As a family of CMs, indium tin oxide (ITO) has attracted considerable interest owing to its unique optical, electronic, and mechanical properties. Among the most spectacular physical and chemical properties, ITO was found to be an electron collector and transporter, which may be used to boost performances of various energy conversion and storage devices such as photovoltaic devices [42], supercapacitors [43], and lithium-ion batteries [44] or to be a dispersible carrier for catalysts [45]. For example, Dam and Lee [43] reported a novel mesoporous MnO2/ITO nanowire nanocomposite that exhibits a significantly enhanced electrochemical performance and higher capacitance retention ratio compared with the mesoporous MnO2 film. Park et al. [44] synthesized three-dimensional ITO/TiO2 hybrid nanostructured electrodes via a thermal evaporation method, and the obtained electrodes showed superior rate capabilities and long-term life cycle for high-power lithium-ion rechargeable batteries. Saravanakumar et al. [45] constructed a composite electrode by drop casting the mixture of P25 titania and Nafion solution on an ITO electrode, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 40% to convert CO2 to urea with a combined reduction of nitrate ions in aqueous solution. All the aforementioned studies show that the ITO-based composite materials can improve the performance of various optoelectronic and energy conversion devices. However, to date, ITO has seldom been used in the field of photocatalysis with the purpose of modifying the surface structure of other semiconductors for enhanced catalytic performance. Herein, we propose an effective and alternative preparation of body center cubic (bcc) ITO nanoparticles (NPs)–loaded g-C3N4 via a facile one-pot method by simply calcining the mixture of ITO NPs and melamine, the g-C3N4 precursor, in air, wherein ITO NPs are homogeneously dispersed onto the surface of g-C3N4. Remarkably, benefiting from the close contact of well-dispersed ITO NPs with g-C3N4 in the prepared ITO/g-C3N4 and in situ deposition of Pt onto ITO NPs, leading to promoted photogenerated electron transfer from g-C3N4 across the ITO pumps to Pt for water reduction, the resultant Pt/ITO/g-C3N4 system exhibits excellent activity and stability for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible light."
1,Experiments,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Melamine (C3H6N6) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Indium(III) acetylacetonate (In(acac)3), tin(IV) tert-butoxide (Sn(OtBu)4), anhydrous benzyl alcohol (C7H8O), and chloroform (CHCl3) were obtained from Aldrich. All the materials were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. Deionized water, with a resistivity of 18.25 MΩ cm, was used throughout the experiments."
3,Synthesis of pristine g-C3N4,"2.2 Synthesis of pristine g-C3N4 Pristine g-C3N4 was synthesized by the well-reported thermal polymerization method [46]. Typically, 2 g of melamine was put into an alumina crucible with a cover and calcined at 520 °C in air for 4 h, with a ramping rate of 5 °C/min. After the crucible was cooled to room temperature, the yellow pristine g-C3N4 was collected and ground into powder. It should be claimed that the widely used ‘g-C3N4’ in the literature is actually non-stoichiometric. Here, we use ‘g-C3N4’ to describe the products condensed from melamine just to keep consistent with the general usage."
4,Synthesis of ITO,"2.3 Synthesis of ITO ITO NPs were synthesized via a previously published non-aqueous sol–gel procedure [47]. Typically, in a glove box, In(acac)3 (0.6166 g, 1.50 mmol) and Sn(OtBu)4 (0.04226 g, 0.103 mmol) were stirred in a glass vial with benzyl alcohol (20 mL) for about 1 h. The slightly turbid reaction mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined steel autoclave, which was taken out of the glove box and heated to 200 °C in a laboratory furnace. After 24 h, the autoclave was removed from the furnace and cooled to room temperature under ambient conditions. The products were isolated by centrifugation, washed twice with chloroform, and dried at 60 °C for 12 h in air."
5,Synthesis of ITO/g-C3N4,"2.4 Synthesis of ITO/g-C3N4 ITO/g-C3N4 was synthesized by simply calcining the mixture of ITO and melamine in air. In detail, desired amounts of ITO and melamine were added into 200 mL of deionized water in a 250-mL glass beaker at 90 °C under vigorous stirring for 2 h. Then, the temperature was elevated to 100 °C to evaporate the solution. The resultant powder mixture of ITO/melamine was collected and calcined at 520 °C in air for 4 h with a ramping rate of 5 °C/min. The mass ratios of ITO to melamine were 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, and 5%, with the resultant ITO/g-C3N4 samples denoted as ITO-x (x = 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 5), respectively."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a PANalytical X'pert Pro MPD diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 40 mA using Ni-filtered Cu Kα irradiation (wavelength = 1.5406 Å). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning transmission electronmicroscopy (STEM) images were recorded on a FEI Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. An OXFORDMAX-80 energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector which was mounted in the above TEM was used to conduct the elementalanalysis. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD instrument with a monochromatized Al Kα line source (150 W). All the binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were conducted using a Surface Area and Porosity Analyzer (ASAP 2020, Micromeritics) at 77 K after degassing the samples at 150 °C for 4 h. The specific surface area and pore volume were determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The pore size distribution was calculated using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Vertex 70 FTIR spectrometer using the KBr pellet technique. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded on a Cary Series UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies). The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were carried out at room temperature using a PTI QM-4 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The surface photovoltage (SPV) spectra were obtained for investigating charge features using self-made equipment."
7,Photoelectrochemical and electrochemical measurements,"2.6 Photoelectrochemical and electrochemical measurements The (photo)electrochemical properties were measured in a conventional three-electrode cell system, in which the as-prepared photocatalysts were coated on fluoride tin oxide substrates and used as the working electrodes, an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, and a platinum mesh as the counter electrode. 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. A 500 W Xe arc lamp with adjustable power settings through an air mass 1.5 G filter (Oriel) was used as light source (100 mW/cm2). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded at an applied potential of 0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl over the frequency range of 0.1 Hz–10 KHz. The transient photocurrent response with on/off cycles was measured at an applied potential of 0.2 V versus Ag/AgCl."
8,Photocatalytic measurements,"2.7 Photocatalytic measurements Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions were performed in a 230-mL gas-closed Pyrex reactor. In a typical photocatalytic reaction, 50 mg of photocatalysts was dispersed in 200 mL of aqueous solution of triethanolamine (TEOA, 10 vol%) by a magnetic stirrer with constant rotational velocity. Nitrogen was purged through the reactor for 20 min before reaction to remove the residual air. A 300 W Xe lamp with a 420-nm cutoff filter was used to trigger the photocatalytic hydrogen generation. The temperature of the reaction solution was kept at 35 °C via a circulating water pump during the whole experiment. Evolved hydrogen was measured through a thermal conductivity detector gas chromatograph (NaX zeolite column and nitrogen as the carrier gas). Blank experiments revealed no appreciable hydrogen evolution without irradiation or photocatalysts."
9,Results and discussion,"ITO NPs were synthesized by a previously reported non-aqueous sol–gel method [47]. The obtained ITO with a size of ca. 20 nm (Fig. 1 a) was identified as In1.825Sn0.125O3, which possesses good crystallinity and is highly consistent with the bcc phase (JCPDS No. 01-089-4597) [48]. Then, the ITO-loaded g-C3N4 was prepared through a facile one-pot method via simply calcining the mixture of the as-prepared ITO and melamine, the g-C3N4 precursor, in air (see the Experimental section for details). The resultant ITO/g-C3N4 samples were denoted as ITO-x (x = 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 5), where x indicates the mass ratio of ITO to melamine (0.05%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, and 5%) in the one-pot preparation process. The crystal structure of the obtained ITO-x samples was characterized by XRD patterns. As shown in Fig. 1b, the XRD pattern of pristine g-C3N4 displays two diffraction peaks at 2θ = 13.1° and 27.3°, which are associated with the (100) and (002) characteristic planes of g-C3N4, representing the in-plane structural packing of tri-s-triazine (heptazine) units and interlayer stacking of g-C3N4 sheets, respectively [31]. These two peaks for ITO-x gradually weaken with the amounts of ITO increasing, meaning a decrease of the long-range order of g-C3N4 and a host–guest interaction of g-C3N4 with ITO [26]. On the other hand, the intensities of the ITO characteristic peak in ITO-x present progressive increase with increasing amounts of ITO, proving the successful loading of ITO on g-C3N4 [41]. Furthermore, XPS results (Fig. S1) also confirmed the successful synthesis of ITO NPs and their existence on the ITO-x samples by detecting In3+ (In 3d5/2 peak at 444.4 eV, In 3d3/2 peak at 451.9 eV) and Sn3+ (Sn 3d5/2 peak at 486.6 eV, Sn 3d3/2 peak at 495.0 eV) [49]. The morphology of ITO-x was investigated by TEM. Here, we take ITO-0.1 as an example. As seen from Fig. 1c, ITO NPs with irregular shapes are well dispersed on the surface of g-C3N4 in ITO-0.1. The elemental mappings of N, In, and Sn species and EDX spectrum for ITO-0.1 have been performed to evaluate the elemental distribution (Fig. 1d,e). Apparently, the metal elements are found enriched in the ITO areas of ITO-0.1, while N element from g-C3N4 is uniformly distributed in the whole sample area, further evidencing the successful loading of ITO onto the surface of g-C3N4. Besides, the similar characteristics in the FTIR spectra of the as-prepared samples suggest good retention of both the heptazine ring and trigonal C-N(-C)-C/bridging C-NH-C units of g-C3N4 (Fig. S2) in ITO-x [31]. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of the prepared samples was evaluated by carrying out the photocatalytic reaction in TEOA aqueous solutions under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). The impact of loaded ITO NPs on the photoactivity of g-C3N4 was first investigated. As shown in Fig. 2 a, with ITO loading, all the ITO-x samples show much higher hydrogen production activities compared with pristine g-C3N4. Specifically, as the mass ratio of ITO to melamine increases to 0.1%, the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution over ITO-x continually increases, and the highest hydrogen evolution rate (HER) reaching 36.77 μmol h−1 g−1 is achieved over ITO-0.1, which is 2.9 times as high as that of pristine g-C3N4 (12.68 μmol h−1 g−1). Further increasing the mass ratio of ITO to melamine to 0.5% or more gives rise to the decreased activities. This could be attributed to the shading effect of more and more loaded ITO NPs on the g-C3N4 surface, hindering light absorption and decreasing the number of samples' active sites available for water reduction reaction [25]. As a consequence, the positive effect of ITO would be weakened by the negative shading effect of the large coverage of ITO NPs, leading to the optimal photocatalytic performance obtained at ITO-0.1. It is, therefore, important to load ITO at an appropriate level. The photocatalytic activity of the three-component Pt/ITO/g-C3N4 system was thereafter investigated. With the optimized content of ITO, the HER of modified photocatalysts can be further increased after the deposition of Pt. In the presence of 0.1 wt% ITO and 1 wt% Pt, the Pt-ITO-0.1 sample exhibits significantly enhanced photoactivity toward hydrogen production. The average HER is more than 26 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4 (Fig. 2b). Further comparison indicates that the maximum hydrogen production rate of Pt-ITO-0.1 reaches 335.53 μmol h−1 g−1, which is 9.1- and 3.3-fold higher than that of ITO-0.1 and Pt/g-C3N4 (Pt-CN), respectively. These results indicate that ITO and Pt have the synergetic effects on the hydrogen production activity of g-C3N4. To confirm the reproducibility of hydrogen production using the optimized photocatalyst (i.e., Pt-ITO-0.1), the experiment was repeated four times. As can be seen from Fig. 2c, almost unchanged photoactivities are obtained, indicating the good stability of Pt and ITO synergistically modified g-C3N4. Additionally, we have evaluated the HER of the Pt-ITO-0.1 sample under different specific wavelength illuminations. As shown in Fig. 2d, the HER of the sample is associated with the DRS. When the illumination wavelengths are λ > 420, 450, 480, and 500 nm, the HER value is 335.53, 149.81, 36.24, and 7.46 μmol h−1 g−1, respectively. This suggests that this hydrogen evolution reaction is indeed a photo-induced process [34]. To clarify the fundamental reasons for the superior activity of Pt and ITO synergistically modified g-C3N4, the light absorption behavior of different samples was investigated by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. S3, all samples exhibit characteristic absorption sharp edges at around 460 nm due to the intrinsic bandgap of g-C3N4 [31]. The introduction of ITO and Pt presents negligible influence on the light absorption of photocatalysts. Therefore, light absorption is not the reason for the superior photoactivity of Pt/ITO/g-C3N4. Fig. S4 and Table S1 in the Supplementary material compare the BET surface area of g-C3N4, ITO-0.1, Pt-CN, and Pt-ITO-0.1. It can be seen that the BET surface area of these samples is similar and do not show the same change tendency with the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance (Fig. 2b), indicating that the BET surface area also has little effect on the enhanced photoactivity of Pt/ITO/g-C3N4 system. Furthermore, the steady-state PL emission spectra and the SPV spectra were performed to explore the impact of the introduced ITO and Pt on the charge carrier separation in g-C3N4. A strong PL emission peak centered at 460 nm could be observed for the pristine g-C3N4 (Fig. 3 a), which is obviously quenched for ITO-0.1 and Pt-CN samples after ITO or Pt loading. Note that the lower PL intensity is an indication of the lower recombination of electron–hole pairs, and thus the synergetic effect between ITO and Pt can efficiently inhibit the recombination of charge carriers [12]. This could be further corroborated by SPV spectra. One can find an obvious positive SPV response (Fig. 3b), the typical feature of an n-type semiconductor, in the range of 300–450 nm for pristine g-C3N4 [37]. This SPV response shows successively increased intensity as the loading of ITO, Pt, and both of ITO and Pt on g-C3N4, confirming the efficient separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in ITO- or/and Pt-modified g-C3N4 [37]. Next, the contribution of loaded ITO and Pt on the charge transfer behavior of g-C3N4 was evaluated by EIS measurements. In Fig. 3c, Pt-ITO-0.1 presents a representative Nyquist plot with a much smaller arc radius than those of pristine g-C3N4, ITO-0.1 and Pt-CN. It demonstrates an effective separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and fast interfacial charge transfer caused by loading ITO and Pt together onto g-C3N4 [26]. The consistent conclusion is also supported by photoelectric response tests (Fig. 3d), which were recorded for several on–off cycles of intermittent irradiation, and Pt and ITO synergistically modified g-C3N4 reveals the highest transient photocurrent response. Therefore, the synergetic effect between ITO and Pt can efficiently inhibit the recombination of charge carriers in g-C3N4. According to the previous report, ITO was found to prefer to work as an electron collector and transporter to boost performances of various energy conversion and storage devices [42–45]. Here, we have achieved a high-performance Pt/ITO/g-C3N4 system profited from the accelerated charge carrier separation. To verify that ITO facilitates charge carrier separation in g-C3N4 indeed by capturing photogenerated electron rather than hole in this work, photodeposition of Pt and PbO2, according to the reported method [24], was respectively carried out on the ITO-0.1 sample. Fig. 4 shows typical (S)TEM images of Pt- or PbO2-loaded ITO-0.1 and the corresponding elemental mappings. One can clearly find that Pt and ITO NPs are deposited in the same position, whereas PbO2 and ITO NPs are dispersed separately on the surface of g-C3N4, and no PbO2 NPs are found on ITO. Note that no hydrogen was produced from pure ITO even with Pt loading (Fig. 2a), it is thus understandable that the Pt NPs were mainly photoreduced by the photogenerated electrons in ITO originated from g-C3N4, and nearly no photogenerated holes transferred through ITO from g-C3N4 to deposite PbO2. Therefore, through this photodeposition tests, it can be confirmed that there was electron transfer rather than hole transfer through the special ITO channel when the ITO-loaded g-C3N4 was photoexcited for redox reactions. In other words, ITO actually acts as the electronic pump to promote electron transfer and thus enhance the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4. On the basis of the previous analysis in structures, optical properties, and charge transfer processes, a possible mechanism for this photocatalytic system is proposed (Fig. 5 ). On irradiation, excited electrons and holes are generated in g-C3N4 and some of them encounter bulk recombination or surface recombination on their way to catalyze redox reactions. After loading ITO NPs on the surface of g-C3N4, the original unpopular recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs is inhibited as the loaded ITO can work as an electronic pump by trapping photogenerated electrons to promote electron transfer and charge separation. Moreover, in situ formation of Pt onto ITO NPs can facilitate the electron transfer from g-C3N4 to Pt through the ITO electronic pump for water reduction reaction, further strengthening the charge carrier separation. Consequently, Pt/ITO/g-C3N4 system shows much increased photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution under visible light."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, by simply calcining the mixture of bcc ITO NPs and melamine in air, we have successfully loaded bcc ITO NPs on g-C3N4. The loaded ITO NPs are homogeneously dispersed onto the surface of g-C3N4, and the resultant Pt/ITO/g-C3N4 system exhibits excellent activity and stability for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible light. It is evidenced that the close contact of well-dispersed ITO NPs with g-C3N4 in the prepared ITO/g-C3N4 and in situ formation of Pt onto ITO NPs could accelerate photogenerated electron transfer from g-C3N4 to Pt through ITO NPs as electronic pumps for efficient water reduction reaction. The modification strategy developed here demonstrates the important role of ITO loaded onto the surface of g-C3N4 toward efficient water-splitting hydrogen production. It is thus expected that this strategy could be used to modify the surface structure of other semiconductors for improved photoactivities for solar energy capture and conversion."
