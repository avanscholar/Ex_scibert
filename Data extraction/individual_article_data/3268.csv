0,Introduction,"The world population is expected to grow in next years and will approach 9 billion by 2050 [1], requiring a corresponding increase in crop production and food supply. To meet the food demand of the world population, much attention has been paid to fertilizers NPK which generates immense development in modern agriculture and plays an important role in food security [2]. However, most commercially uncoated fertilizers are well known for low efficiency of plant nutrients uptake. In fact, an estimated 30–70% loss of nutrients supplied as commercial fertilizers, depending on application method and soil conditions [3], leads to financial losses for farmers, poses a risk to the environment, and represents a waste of energy [4]. One method for overcoming these shortcomings involves the use of slow-release fertilizers, especially polymer coated fertilizer (PCF), which has demonstrated many advantages over the conventional types, such as decreasing fertilizer loss rate, supplying nutrient sustainably, lowering application frequency, and minimizing potential negative effects associated with overdosage [5]. Polyolefin,alkyd-resinandpolyurethanecoated fertilizers are important commercially available synthetic polymers coatings for CRF, manufactured by Chissoasahi Fertilizer Co, Scotts Co and Pursell Industries, Inc as Nutricote ®, Osmocote ® and Polyon ®trademarks, respectively [5]. However, these polymers have shown many drawbacks, such as their high prices and their negative impact on the environment. According to Trenkel [5], the use of polymeric materials in coatings could lead to an undesirable accumulation of plastic residues of up to 50 kg/ha/year. To reduce soil pollution and price, concentrated efforts have been put into developing environmentally friendly coating materials. Thus, development of environmentally friendly and renewable sources as PCFs is necessary and urgent [6]. Biological polymers such as lignin, starch, chitin, cellulose and other polysaccharides (e.g., k-carrageenan) appear to be a potential alternative to synthetic polymers for CRF fertilizer coating and could contribute significantly to organic waste recycling and the circular economy [2]. Starch is biopolymer available in large amounts from several renewable plats sources, it is biodegradable and relatively inexpensive, which make it attractive as an environmentally friendly polymer for general consumer applications [7]. Unfortunately, using starch for non-food use in its native form as effective coating material is often limited due to its poor solubility, low mechanical properties and instability at high temperature and pH [8]. Therefore, more efforts are made to explore usage of starch-based products for an encapsulating matrix in the controlled release for agrochemicals after derivatization and cross-linking including bending and chemical modifications [9,10].The development of modified starch polymers as controlled release devices in agroindustries and biomedical areas is used to improve its properties [11]. Chemical modification was used to prepare starch-based-graft polymers coatings for controlled release of urea by in-situ copolymerization of starch with monomers such as vinyl acetate [12], acrylonitrile [13], and L-lactide [14]. Urea fertilizer coated with starch-grafted-rubber was also prepared and used as a polymer membrane for controlling urea fertilizer and it easily degraded in soil [15]. The obtained core–shell structure is amphiphilic with the core of hydrophilic starch and the shell of hydrophobic polymer grafts, exhibit relatively low swellability and can be used for encapsulating water-soluble fertilizes such as urea for controlled-release. However, their preparations require several steps including the polymerization reaction, the purification of grafted polymer using organic solvent and therefore expensive. Blending modification has been also used to prepare PCF. Blends of starch with polysulfone [16], and starch with polyurethane has been reported [17]. Although starch blends with hydrocarbon-derived synthetic polymers have been claimed biodegradable coatings for fertilizers, the problem is to minimize the relative proportion of synthetic polymers in natural-synthetic polymer blends to achieve the more benign biodegradability in soil environment. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a water soluble, semi-crystalline, fully biodegradable and non-toxic polymer, extensively used in paper coating, textile sizing, drug release and flexible water-soluble packaging films. A biodegradable starch/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) blend film for coating the soluble granular fertilizer has been prepared [18]. The influence of the starch/PVA ratio in permeability and absorption of water and permeability to ammonium was investigated. The water absorption and permeability to water and permeability to ammonium increased with increasing PVA content, while reduced concentrations of starch affected the compatibility of the films, due to their inherent permeability and biodegradability. The study of starch/glycerol/PVA/urea composite films was studied by Lum et al. [19]. The properties of different formulations obtained by modifying bending ratio of starch, glycerol and PVA were also investigated. The starch/PVA/glycerol composites as coating for urea Fertilizer were prepared in different formulations by varying their proportions using formaldehyde as crosslinking agent [20]. A fluid bed spray coater was used to encapsulate urea. Variation of the blending ratio of starch, PVA and glycerol influence the swellability and biodegradability of the obtained coatings. However, no study of the behavior release of Nitrogen of urea from these composite coatings in water or soil has been performed to evaluate their controlled release. In contrast to native one, starch acetate (SA), obtained by acetylation of starch, is a relatively new polymer used as an excipient in controlled release pharmaceutical dosage forms [21]. The degree of substitution with acetyl moiety in starch has great influence on solubility as well as on other mechanical and physico-chemical properties. The degree of acetylation was also shown to affect the rate of drug release substantially and the film forming properties [22]. To our knowledge, there is a few study reported the controlled release of fertilizers coated with SA formulations. Starch acetate (SA) with high degree of substitution was synthesized and used as a novel hydrophobic coating to allow for the slow release of the fertilizer nutrients. Carboxymethyl starch (CMS) and xanthan gum (XG) were used to prepare starch based absorbent material for improving water retention capacity of soil and water use efficiency [24]. In this study, we propose the use of different formulations based on starch acetate (SA) as hydrophobic matrix, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as reinforcing agent and glycerol (GLY) as plasticizer for coating Diammonium Phosphate (DAP) fertilizers without any use of organic solvents by varying their composition. These SA formulations can be used as a novel hydrophobic coating to allow for the slow release of the fertilizer nutrients. The introduction of these natural materials and their derivatives can induce biodegradability and full protection of the environment."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Diammonium Phosphate (DAP), a granular phosphate fertilizer (46% P2O5), is a gift from OCP Group, Morocco. Corn starch acetate (SA) (2%, Gtissalys G115) was kindly provided by Roquette (Lestrem-France). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (Mw: 13,000–23,000 g/mol, 87–89% hydrolysed) and glycerol (GLY) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France)."
3,Preparation of composite films and coated fertilizers,"2.2 Preparation of composite films and coated fertilizers The starch SA /PVA/GLY composite films (Table 1 ) were produced by the following method. The calculated amounts of SA, PVA and GLY were mixed at various ratios and 10 mL of distilled water was slowly added to the mixture at room temperature under magnetic stirring for 30 min to form dispersion. When completely suspended, the temperature of the mixture was slowly raised to 90 °C maintaining stirring for 30 min to completely gelatinize the starch acetate (Fig. 1 a). Then, DAP fertilizers were thoroughly blended with the mixture with a glass rod and then dried at room temperature leading to coated DAF single layer. This operation was repeated a second time on the coated DAP (first layer) to form a second or double layer. Next, the mixture was poured into a Teflon mold. After drying the mixture at room temperature, the composite films were allowed to dry in a conventional oven at 60 °C for 4 h and then dried composite films were removed from the mold. Fig. 1b shows the digital photos of the three films as prepared."
4,Water absorptiontest,"2.3 Water absorptiontest All the blend films were dried in an oven at 50° C for 24 h and stored in a desicator. The films were immersed in distilled water for 1 h. After removing excess water and drying the swollen films at room temperature for 10 min and then weighted. The water absorption (WA) is calculated according to Eq. (1): (1) W A = M - M 0 M 0 where M and M0 refer to the weight of the swollen and dried absorbent material, respectively."
5,Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),2.4 Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) FTIR analyses were performed in transmittance mode with a Perkin Elmer 1725X spectrometer. The spectra were scanned within the 400–4000 cm−1 range.
6,Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),"2.5 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) The morphological characterization of uncoated and coated fertilizer (DAP) was performed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) using VEGA-3 (TESCAN-France) with an accelerating voltage of 10 kV (mode image), and coupled to an Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis system."
7,Water release assays,"2.6 Water release assays The water release assays were performed as follows: 50 mg of uncoated and coated DAP granules were placed in Beaker of 125 mL of distilled water at room temperature. The phosphorus concentration was determinated following the methodology described by AFNOR T90-023, involving the preparation of a mixed reagent (5 mL of 2.8 g/l antimony and potassium tartrate solution + 50 mL of sulfuric acid (15%) + 15 mL of 40 g/l ammonium molybdate + 30 mL of distilled water to complete the volume to 100 mL) together with the ascorbic acid solution (20 g/l). In the case of nitrogen, the concentration was determinated following the methodology described by NF T90-015–2. Three solutions were prepared according the following proportions: phenol nitroprusside solution (35 g phenol + 0.4 g sodium nitroprusside + distilled water was added to complete the volume to 1L), alkaline solution(800 mL of distilled water + 20 g sodium hydroxide + 380 g sodium citrate, after boiling step for 20 min, the distilled water was added to the cooled mixture to complete the volume to 1 L) and Sodium hypochlorite solution. 10 mL of diluted sample was added to 2 mL of the mixed reagent + 0.5 mL of ascorbic acid solution to determine phosphorus concentration. Then, this mixed solution was stirred for 30 min at room temperature forming a blue complex. In order to determine nitrogen concentration, 10 mL of diluted sample was added to 0.5 mL of alkaline reagent + 0.5 mL of phenol nitroprusside reagent + 3–4 drops of sodium hypochlorite solution. This mixture was analyzed after 6 h to obtain a blue complex. The forming solutions are analysed at wavelength of 880 and 630 nm for P and N, respectively, using an Ultraviolet–Visible (UV–Vis) spectrophotometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Properties of SA/PVA/GLY composite films,"3.1 Properties of SA/PVA/GLY composite films Commercial SA used is in study was obtained by acetylation of starch which has a molecular structure composed of linear molecules (amylose: 26%) and branched molecules (amylopectin: 74%). In acetylated starch, part of hydroxyl groups in anhydroglucose units of starch have been converted to acetyl groups corresponding to degree of substitution (DS). This DS close to 0.08 in our case corresponding to 2% of acetyl content in SA [21]. The acetyl moiety confers to SA some hydrophobic character, improve its film forming property in contact to starch which has a poor mechanical property due to its brittle. This low DS confers to SA some solubility in water than those with high DS which are generally soluble in organic solvents. GLY was use also as plasticizer, in fact as reported by Fertahi et al. [24], elasticity is an important parameter for the water absorbency of the coating polymer. This property could be important for a coating formulation to resist pressure without breaking during the swelling of a coated granule. Furthermore, coating films with a plasticizer remained intact in water [25]. Moreover, addition of polyvinyl alcohol in starch acetate-glycerol blends is expected to exhibit excellent mechanical properties and compatibility with the blend composites [19,26]."
10,Water absorption (WA),"3.2 Water absorption (WA) In order to make a good SRF coating, the water absorption (WA) of prepared films was carried out. Fig. 2 displays the WA for different composites. As shown in Fig. 2, the water absorbency of SA/PVA/GLY blend films decreases by increasing the amount of SA. This is due to the hydrophobic nature of SA related to the acetyl content (DS = 0.08) compared to native starch (DS = 0). In fact, an increasing of the percentage of SA in the corresponding composites with GLY and PVOH results in an increasing of WA as reported by Lum et al. [19]. Indeed, using derivate starch such as carboxymethyl starch (CMS) with a high degree of substitution (DS = 0.91) results in an decreasing of WA when the % CMS is higher [23]. Its miscibility in water was also reduced as it becomes more soluble in organic solvents which is less ecofriendly for the preparation of green controlled release fertilizers coatings. The application of GLY and PVA (reinforcing agent) leads to an increase in water absorbency. The presence of hydroxyl groups in the PVA, which has more –OH than starch acetate, are mainly responsible for the increased water absorption [18]. The WA capacity of SA/GLY/PVA composite films increases when GLY content is higher, the films containing more hygroscopic plasticizer absorbed more water. When the glycerol penetrates into the SA granules in the blend composites, it disrupts its crystallographic structure. The intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the SA polymer chains of composite films is reduced limiting the absorption of water."
11,Infrared characterization of forming films,"3.3 Infrared characterization of forming films The IR spectra of SA, PVA and SA/GLY//PVA composite films are shown in Fig. 3 . In the spectrum of starch acetate (SA), there are several peaks at 3426, 1750, 1373, 1240, and 1080 cm−1 assigned to O–H stretching vibration of alcohol, CO stretching vibration of ester, CH3 bending vibration, C-O flexural vibration, and C–O stretching vibration of ester, respectively [23]. The characteristic absorption bands of pure PVA occur at 3400 cm−1 (assigned to the O–H stretching vibration of the hydroxyl), 2936 cm−1 (characterize the aliphatic C–H symmetric stretching vibration), 1710 cm (CO carbonyl stretch from the residual acetate group in the PVA), 1550 cm−1 (corresponds to C–H bending) and 1015 cm−1 (corresponds to C-O stretching vibration) [27]. IR analysis of all tested formulations (CF-1, CF-2 and CF-3) demonstrate that all spectres have the same peaks with a gradually amplification in the intensity of the bands located at 1015 and 3400 cm−1 corresponding to the vibrations of C–C and O–H bonds, respectively, when the PVA and glycerol contents increase in the composite films. It’s also noticed that the hydroxyl group stretching band at 3500 cm−1 is shifted to higher frequencies (approximatively 10 cm−1) when the glycerol content increases. The changes observed are probably due to that the hydrogen bonds between water and glycerol are partially replaced by the hydrogen bonds between SA and glycerol, which arerelatively weak [19]."
12,Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis,"3.4 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis To understand the profile of the coating between the fertilizer and the coating, the microscopic morphology of the surface and cross-section of uncoated DAP and coated DAP with with CF-2 single layer (1L) and double layers (2L) as example was observed from the SEM (Fig. 4 ). Fig. 4a showed that the surface of uncoated granule DAP presented a rough structure. When this surface was enlarged at high magnitude, some pinholes and irregular morphology were obviously observed in Fig. 4d. These cavities and cracks in the surface might be easily permeated by water molecules, then resulting in the quick release of nutrients from uncoated DAP fertilizer [28]. Similar result was observed in the DAP granule coated by biobased amino oil as was reported by our group [29]. When the DAP granules were covered by CF-2 1L and 2L (Fig. 4e, f), the coatings showed a smoother surface than that of uncoated DAP [29,30]. The microscopic structures of the coated DAP were also obtained by using SEM, Fig. 4h, k shows the cross-section micrographs SEM of the CF-2 coating materials 1L and 2L. The formation of cohesive films with different thicknesses were observed. The border and adhesion between DAP and the film coating was irregular and sometimes difficult to observe, most likely due to the nonspherical shape and irregular surface of the initial DAP granules [24]. The thicknesses of different coated DAP granules were also determined and were found to be significantly different depending on their percentages (1L or 2L). The average thickness is approximately 45 and 95 μm for the DAP coated by CF-2 corresponding to 1L and 2L, respectively. The thicknesses of the double-coated film are approximately 2.0 times higher compared to the single layer of CF-2 coating films. The performance of CF-2 coating associated with the surface morphology was also studied using SEM coupled with the EDX analyzer. The EDX images of uncoated and covered DAP with the single layer and double layers of composite coatings are illustrated in Fig. 4i, l, m. According to the EDXs results, it’s noticed the presence of phosphorus and nitrogen on the surface of uncoated DAP which constitute the nutritive elements composing the DAP fertilizer. Based on the visibility of these signals (P, N), the quality of the coating films could be evaluated. The percentage of nutrients on the surface of coated DAP decrease by increasing the number of applied layers. The small amount of phosphates detected in CF-2 single layer could be attributed to the presence of some microspores on the surface of this coating which has low thickness (45 μm) with a thin layer. In addition, the increased carbon and oxygen contents on the surface of the coating is attributed to the CF-2 composition of (SA/PVA/GLY) composite. The difference of carbon and oxygen areas between the coatings 1L and 2L is attributed to the thickness of the CF-2 composite coatings which is higher in 2L than in 1L. These results confirmed the formation of cohesive film with a good adhesion, which resulted are in good agreement with the SEM characterization."
13,Phosphorus and nitrogen release behavior of coated DAP in water,"3.5 Phosphorus and nitrogen release behavior of coated DAP in water The phosphates release profiles were obtained from the procedures described by Liu et al. [31] and Pereira et al. [32]. Considering the practical application of DAP fertilizer granules as a macronutrient fertilizer, the sustainable release behavior of the coated granules with different composite blends (CF1, CF-2 and CF-3) was measured to evaluate their application prospects in agriculture. Fig. 5 displays the percentage of P and N released in water versus time of the uncoated DAP and the coated DAP from three formulations with single and double layers at pH 7 and room temperature. The release behavior showed two stages. In fact, the N and P release rates of coated DAP with all coatings and different layers increased rapidly (first stage: fast release) from 0 to 60 min and gradually increased from 80 to 250 min (second stage: slow release), and finally reached an equilibrium (complete release) after 120–300 min. The obtained times at saturation of both N an P nutrients from different coatings and with different layers are presented in Table 2 . Fig. 5 shows also that the nutrient solubilization rate in water is much slower in the case of encapsulated fertilizers (single and double layers) than for uncoated DAP. In fact, compared with uncoated granule which is totally solubilized after 80 min, the P release profiles of the coated granules with CF-3 composite reached the equilibrium stage approximately after 200 and 270 min when the DAP is coated with single-layer (1L) and double-layer (2L), respectively. Indeed, the time to reach maximum concentration of N release from DAP coated with CF-3 is 2.4 and 3.2 times than the corresponding uncoated DAP, when the DAP is encapsulated with 1L and 2L, respectively, indicating slower N release properties of coated DAP with CF-3. On the other hand, all the formulations used for the encapsulation of the DAP granules induce a decrease in the dissolution rate of the nutrients (P and N) in water compared to uncoated DAP fertilizers which are more soluble in water, and therefore reached the saturation at lower time. In addition, the time to reach the equilibrium corresponding to maximal dissolution of nutrients increases from CF-1, CF-2 and CF-3 formulations. The N release rate for example becomes slower for both layers by increasing the amount of SA as the time to reach the equilibrium corresponding to the maximum nitrogen release indicate the following increasing order: CF-1 < CF-2 < CF-3 (Table 2). This is mainly due to the hydrophobic structure of SA and its percentage in different formulations which increases from CF-1 to CF-3 (Table 1). In fact, when the SA content increases, the water absorption capacity was reduced (Fig. 2). The N nutrient released from the coating after hydrolysis process taking place. Therefore, the nitrogen diffused out the coatings less easily at lower swelling than the higher one, leading to slow diffusion and thus increasing the time to reach the total release of N at equilibrium (Table 2). In our case, SA used in this study has lower DS (0.08) corresponding only to 2% of acetyl groups (small hydrophobic structure) to achieve solubility in water in contrast to SA with high DS which need to use organic solvents for the preparation of coating solutions which not recommended to develop sustainable coatings for slow controlled release of fertilizer nutrients. The thickness of the coating is an important parameter that can significantly govern the nutrient release [33,34]. On the other hand, the coating percentage showed an inverse relation with the release rate of the fertilizer. Cruz et al. [35] reported that the DAP coated with castor polyurethane coatings with 3.0 and 4.5 wt% coating percentage exhibited significant delays in phosphorus release, with 80% release reached in 50 h for 3.0 wt% and 75 h for 4.5 wt%. In our case, the obtained results indicated that thicker CF-2 coating can change the maximum nutrient availability toward longer period. In fact, the maximum dissolution rate was obtained after 230 min for the DAP coated with CF-2 single layer (45 μm), whereas, those covered with CF-2 double layer (95 μm) resulted in maximum release at 300 min. Indeed, compared to urea encapsulated with starch/PVOH hydrogels using citric acid as cross-linked agent (coating thickness: 91.66 μm) [10], 100% nitrogen release was obtained after 60 min which is lower compared to those of DAP coated with CF-2 double layer with similar thickness (95 μm) as the release saturation of nitrogen was reached at 200 min."
14,Conclusion,"In this work, biocomposites such as starch acetate (SA)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/Glycerol (GLY) were prepared for the first time by varying the percentage of different compounds, and tested as external hydrophobic coating shells for monitoring of phosphorus and nitrogen releases from diammonium Phosphate fertilizers. The coating shells were analyzed by FTIR, SEM and EDX. The water absorption of different composite films has been calculated and correlated to the composition of the different formulations. The equilibrium swelling of these biocomposites were lower when the SA content decreases leading to slow diffusion of the nutrients. The morphological structures of coated fertilizers were characterized by SEM and EDX, and revealed the formation of a cohesive film and a good adhesion between DAP fertilizer and coating film. The relation structure and thickness of coatings-kinetic releases of nutrients (N and P) was studied. It has demonstrated that SA, as a hydrophobic matrix, can delay the nutrients diffusion, it acted as physical hydrophobic barrier over DAP granules by diffusion process. Compared with uncoated DAP granule which N is totally solubilized after 95 min, the maximum dissolution rate of N was obtained after 230 min for the DAP coated with CF-2 single layer (45 μm), whereas, those covered with CF-2 double layer (95 μm) resulted in maximum release at 300 min. Compared to urea encapsulated with starch/PVOH hydrogels (91.66 μm) [10], 100% nitrogen release was obtained after 60 min, and therefore the CF-3 (2L) coating presents an improvement of slow-release of nitrogen from coated DAP fertilizers. However, the lower DS of starch acetate reduces its hydrophobicity. Thus, the slow release of the fertilizers must be improved compared to others polysaccharides hydrogels. In fact, starch acetate with higher substitution degree might be also utilized in slow release fertilizer as a coating material which may provide better alternative of existing biodegradable polymers for coating fertilizers. With more in-depth studies on slow release and long-term availability nutrients fertilisers to limit the phosphorus and nitrogen losses, it’s expected to obtained SA/PVA/GLY eco-friendly composites by tailoring their compositions. The objective is to use SA with DS ranging between 0.3 and 2 to increase the hydrophobicity of the obtained coatings and using green solvents such as water or mixture water/alcohol. The cross-linking density of the absorbent material is also a technique used to decrease the water absorbency of the coating materials. Lun et al. [23] reported the preparation of the starch/PVA/GLY using formaldehyde as cross-linked agent of hydroxyl groups of PVA and SA. However, the chemical used for cross-linking reaction is relatively toxic and classed CMR. We propose here to use trisodium trimetaphosphate (TSTP), it is a solid of low toxicity and is an effective cross-linking agent at warm temperature with hydrated starch in aqueous slurry [36]. The optimisation and characterization of these new coatings is under investigation."
