0,Introduction,"Exploring renewable energy conversion technology is of immense importance today to tackle the energy crisis and environmental problems. Water splitting to hydrogen is one of the most promising approach to solve increasing energy demands and associated environmental concerns.[1–3] Among these, photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production is a hopeful way to provide sustainable energy.[4] However, there are a number of factors restricted photocatalytic hydrogen production such as low solar utilization efficiency and even no response in dark or overcast days.[5] In order to solve these obstacles, piezoelectric materials have received extensive attention in recent years in the use of mechanical energy for hydrogen evolution and environmental purification.[6–8] More and more research focus on the combination of photocatalysis and piezoelectric catalysis, and in-depth study of the synergistic effect of them to achieve the improvement of catalytic activity.[9–12] Piezo-photocatalysis is a novel field that can simultaneously utilize mechanical energy and solar energy to catalytic water splitting for hydrogen production.[13,14] The strain-induced piezoelectric field can regulate carrier migration between the body and the piezoelectric surface, further improve the catalytic activity of hydrogen production by piezoelectric semiconductor based on piezoelectric photoelectron effect.[15,16] Wang et al. reported that the synergistic piezo-photocatalytic water splitting and pollutant degradation of Al@BaTiO3 plasmonic heterostructures on Ti foams. Meanwhile, the H2 release efficiency based on the piezo-photocatalyst is enhanced by more than 50% compared with the pristine BaTiO3.[17] The strontium titanate (SrTiO3), which possesses excellent crystal and electronic structure properties, chemical stability, inexpensive and environment-friendly, has attracted widespread attention in the field of photocatalysis.[18,19] However, SrTiO3 has poor response to visible light and high recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes, which limits its wide range of applications.[20] Due to the similar cubic perovskite-type of BaTiO3, SrTiO3 displaying remarkable piezoelectric properties and expecting to develop as a piezoelectric photocatalyst for hydrogen production. Recently, Liu et al. discovered that the positions of the ultrasonic vibrators have great effect on the sono-photocatalytic hydrogen production of SrTiO3 nanoparticles.[21] Proverbially, the catalytic reaction is a process that can conduct or a catalyst chemical reaction on the surface, thus changing the surface properties of the catalyst can significantly enhance its catalytic activity. In photocatalysis, surface modification by the hydrophilic functional group can effectively increase hydrophilicity and promote photo-generated electrons and holes separation, consequently improving photocatalytic hydrogen production rate.[22–24] Although surface modulation has been widely applied in photocatalysis, the application of surface modification to accelerate piezoelectric catalytic especially piezo-photocatalytic performance had been hardly reported. In addition, most of the synthetic methods for SrTiO3 are high-temperature solid-phase method, which addicted high energy consumption, larger size and serious agglomeration.[25–27] The low-temperature solid-state precursor method can adjust the size and microstructure of nanomaterials by controlling the morphology of precursors and simultaneously reduce synthetic temperature to a large extent, which had been used for the synthesis of nanomaterials with different morphologies.[28–30] Inspired by this, a low-temperature solid-state precursor method was adopted to synthesize OH-modified SrTiO3 nanoparticles. The photocatalytic, piezocatalytic and piezo-photocatalytic hydrogen production reduction of SrTiO3 and OH-modified SrTiO3 were systemically investigated and compared. Exhilaratingly, the OH-modified SrTiO3 exhibited higher photocatalytic, piezocatalytic and piezo-photocatalytic activity than the pristine SrTiO3. The mechanisms of the enhanced piezo-photocatalytic activity of OH-modified SrTiO3 were also discussed."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals All reagents were of analytical grade from commercial sources and used as received without further purification. Titanium (IV) oxysulfate-sulfuric acid hydrate (TiOSO4·xH2SO4·xH2O, 93%) and strontium nitrate (Sr(NO3)2, ≥ 99.0%) were commercial products obtained from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). Sodium hydroxide (NaOH, granule) was purchased from Tianjin Beilian Fine Chemicals Development Co. LTD (Tianjin, China). Polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG4000, AR) was bought from Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chemical Research Institute (Tianjin, China). Methanol (CH3OH, AR) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Deionized water was used throughout the experiments."
3,Sample preparation,"2.2 Sample preparation Pure SrTiO3: The SrTiO3 particles were synthesized by a two-step solid-state chemical reaction. Firstly, 1.6 g of TiOSO4·xH2SO4·xH2O and 1.2 g of NaOH were weighed and ground into a fine powder separately, then the two reagents were mixed evenly and ground for about 60 min. Subsequently, the mixture was sealed in a conical flask, which was placed in a water bath at 70°C for 12 h to ensure the completeness of the reaction. Later, the precipitate was collected by washing and drying. Subsequently, 1.1 g of Sr(NO3)2 was ground with the above precipitate for about 30 min to acquire the precursors. Finally, the product was acquired by calcining the precursors at 500°C for 3 h with the rate of 5°C min-1 under an air atmosphere, which was denoted as “STO”. OH-modified SrTiO3: The synthetic method and procedure were the same as the preparation of pure SrTiO3 except for adding nonionic surfactant polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG4000) before NaOH joined, the corresponding resulted product was denoted as “OH-STO”. The schematic diagram of the synthetic procedure was displayed in Scheme 1 ."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations The phase structure of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8) using a Rigaku Smart Lab-SE diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The morphology were assessed by Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800) and High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2100F). The surface chemistry state of the samples were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB250Xi) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Bruker VERTEX 70). A Hitachi U-3900H spectrophotometer was employed to measure the UV-Vis absorption spectra. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the as-prepared products were measured on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-4500, Hitachi, Japan). A surface photovoltage system (CEL-SPS1000) was hired to test the surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS). Unpaired electrons were examined using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR, Bruker EMX nano) spectroscopy. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was acquired on a NETZSCH STA 449F3 simultaneous thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 5°C min-1 from room temperature to 800°C under an air atmosphere."
5,Hydrogen evolution measurement,"2.4 Hydrogen evolution measurement To investigate the hydrogen evolution performance of the as-prepared SrTiO3 (STO) and OH-modified SrTiO3 (OH-STO) catalysts, 50 mg of the selected catalysts were dispersed in 50 mL aqueous solution containing 10 mL methanol as the scavengers. H2PtCl6 solution containing 1 wt% Pt was added to the above-mixed solution. The experiments were carried out under the three different conditions: light illumination with a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300, Perfect Light, China) to simulate photocatalysis, ultrasonic vibration (at 40 kHz, 300 W) to assess piezocatalysis activity, light irradiation with simultaneous ultrasonic vibration (the reaction device diagram is in Fig. S1) for piezo-photocatalysis. These three different conditions of hydrogen generation were evaluated offline, the mixture was sonicated to form a uniform suspension in a 250 mL borosilicate headspace bottle, followed by purging the bottle with Ar gas to eliminate air for about 20 min to completely drive off air. The temperature of the reaction system was maintained at ambient temperature by a water circulation system. To detect the amount of H2, a certain amount of gas components were extracted from the reaction system and then injected into a gas chromatograph (GC-9790, Fu Li, China, TCD, Ar as the carrier gas and 5A molecular sieve column) equipped with a TCD detector at certain intervals."
6,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.5 Photoelectrochemical measurements The Mott-Schottky curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and variety of light/ultrasound currents were tested with a three-electrode cell system. All of the samples were separately spin-coated onto the FTO glass (13-14 Ω m-2, 2.2 mm thick, light transmittance > 84%) to form electrodes and used as the working electrodes. Namely, 85 μL ethanol and 5 mg of as-prepared powder were ultrasonically mixed homogeneously, then the suspension was spin-coated onto FTO glass with a micropipette and finally dried at 100°C for 10 h. The effective area of the electrode was controlled at about 2.0×1.5 cm2. In this system, a commercial Pt sheet was used as the counter electrode, and a commercial saturated Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. (From Tianjin Aida Hengsheng Technology Development Co., LTD, R0305). The 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was employed as the electrolyte. The photocurrent intensity was measured under intermittent illumination with a 300 W Xe lamp. For piezocurrent measurement, double-sided conductive copper adhesive was used between FTO glass and sample to strengthen the adhesion of powder and FTO glass. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted with an amplitude of 5 mV over a frequency from 0.1 Hz to 1 kHz."
7,Results and discussion,"A low-temperature solid-state precursor method was first employed to synthesize SrTiO3, the synthetic procedure of SrTiO3 (STO) and OH-modified SrTiO3 (OH-STO) were shown in Scheme 1. For STO, in a typical process, the amorphous TiO(OH)2 (Fig. S2) was first obtained by a room-temperature solid-state chemical reaction between TiOSO4·xH2SO4·xH2O and NaOH [Eq. (1)], then the TiO(OH)2 reacted with Sr(NO3)2 to get a precursor. According to the TG-DTA curves of the precursors (Fig. 1 a), there is an endothermic peak and sharp weight loss (30%) at about 565°C. In the view of the hysteresis of temperature during TG-DTA testing, the final product was acquired by calcining precursors at 500°C [Eq. (2)]. Significantly, compared with the traditional preparation method (Tab. S1) of SrTiO3, the procedure is relatively simple and the synthetic temperature is much lower in this low-temperature solid-state precursor method. In addition, the yield of the product is as high as 70% (Tab. S2), all of which indicated that this method has a hope to be magnified in industrial production. (1) TiOSO4·x H2SO4·x H2O+(2x+2) NaOH → TiO(OH)2+(x+1) Na2SO4+3x H2O TiO(OH)2+Sr(NO3)2→Precursor → 500Â°C SrTiO3+2NO2 ↑+H2O+1/2 O2 ↑ (2) For OH-STO, the non-ionic surfactant polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG4000) was added during the fabrication of TiO(OH)2 to obtain surface functionalized SrTiO3. The majority of PEG4000 molecules were washed by water because of its good solubility while a minority of PEG4000 were absorbed on the surface of TiO(OH)2 due to the formation of hydrogen bond between TiO(OH)2 and the hydroxyls of PEG4000.[31] These hydroxyl groups were preserved and firmly attached to the surface of SrTiO3 in the subsequent thermal treatment. As displayed in Fig. 1b, the stretching vibration peak of OH-STO at around 3400 cm-1 can be assigned to the OH group, which shows an obvious redshift and the hydroxyl group moves to a low wavenumber and generates a wide and strong absorption peak, indicating the hydroxyl functional group may combine with SrTiO3 and form part of the associative hydrogen bond.[24] Besides, a tiny peak at about 1200 cm-1 and 2800 cm-1 observed in OH-STO can be ascribed to the bending vibration peak and stretching vibration peak of C-O and -CH2, respectively.[32] To further prove the presence of hydroxyl groups in the OH-STO, we used the in situ variable temperature infrared of the OH-STO. As shown in Fig. S3, the OH-STO was in situ heated to 110°C in an air atmosphere and it was observed that the hydroxyl peak of the sample changed from room temperature to 110°C, which may be caused by the loss of the absorbed water in the air. While the hydroxyl peak still existed at 110°C for 30 min, which further proved that the OH have successfully modified on the surface of SrTiO3. Enlightened by the above FTIR, we further proved the difference of surface hydrophilicity between STO and OH-STO, which were monitored by in-situ water contact angle measurements (Fig. 1c).[33] The STO and OH-STO were rather hydrophilic with the initial angle of 109° and 105°, then quickly absorbed into the material, confirming the weak interaction between the water and surface. The water contact angle on STO gradually decreased to 0° within 4080 ms. In comparison, OH-STO showed a better water wetting behavior, the water contact angle on the surface of OH-STO drops rapidly to 0° within 1480 ms (Fig. 1e). The surface hydrophilic evolution trend of STO and OH-STO shows in the dynamic change of water contact angle (Fig. 1d). Simultaneously, we plotted the reciprocal of the contact angle against time, which gave nearly straight lines whose corresponding slopes could be defined as the hydrophilic conversion rates (kh) (Fig. 1d in-line image).[34] The estimated kh values of STO and OH-STO were 5.58 × 10-5 and 22.38 × 10-5 (degree ms)-1, respectively. Therefore, the hydrophilic conversion rate of OH-STO was about 4 times higher than that of STO. Combined with FTIR, all the findings highlighted that the OH modification can effectively lower the interfacial tension of the liquid and the OH-STO is highly hydrophilic. The effect of OH group on the phase composition and crystallinity of SrTiO3 phase was studied by XRD. As demonstrated in Fig. 2 a, all the diffraction peaks of STO and OH-STO can be indexed to the standard pattern of cubic SrTiO3 (JCPDS no. 35-0734)[35], indicating the hydroxyl modification does not change the crystal structure of SrTiO3. According to the EPR spectra of oxygen vacancies in STO and OH-STO (Fig. 2b), the g factor peaked at 2.003 for OH-STO is much stronger than STO, suggesting hydroxyl modification could introduce more oxygen vacancies in SrTiO3 and the more oxygen defects can act as traps to capture photo-electrons and promote electron-hole pairs separation, and thereby facilitating photocatalytic reaction.[36] XPS was employed to further investigate the surface oxidation state of the samples. The XPS survey spectrum also demonstrated only Sr, Ti, O, C, elements existing in STO and OH-STO (Fig. S4). For Sr 3d of STO (Fig. 2c), the curves exhibit two dominating peaks at 134.4 eV and 132.7 eV, which are ascribed to Sr 3d3/2 and Sr 3d5/2 of Sr2+ species in SrTiO3, respectively. [35,37] Additionally, for Ti 2p of STO (Fig. 2d), the two characteristic peaks with Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 at 463.7 eV and 458.0 eV can be attributed to Ti4+ in SrTiO3.[38] From Fig. 2e, the O 1s peaks for STO could be deconvoluted into three peaks which located at 529.3 eV, 530.9 eV and 532.4 eV. The three peaks correspond to lattice oxygen (Sr-O-Ti) in the cubic structure of SrTiO3, the surface hydroxyl group and the H2O or O2 molecules adsorbed on the surface, respectively.[39] The elemental ratios for the two samples were calculated from the survey spectra (Tab. S4) and it demonstrated that the content of oxygen in OH-STO increased, this may resulted from the surface modification of hydroxyl. The XPS spectrum of C 1s shows three peaks at 284.8 eV, 286.0 eV and 288.5 eV, corresponding to C=C, C-O and C=O, respectively (Fig. 2f). Compared with STO, the binding energies for Sr 3d, Ti 2p and O 1s of OH-STO are all positively shifted, suggesting that the Fermi level of SrTiO3 was pushed to a high energy level by increasing the equilibrium electron density.[22] The result corroborates that the interface hydroxyl modification may influence the surface electronic structure and subsequently change the Fermi level of SrTiO3. The morphology of STO and OH-STO were studied by TEM and HRTEM. As shown in Fig. 3 a and d, both of two samples appeared as nanoparticles, the nanoparticles in STO is seriously agglomerated while in OH-STO is relatively dispersal. Furthermore, the morphology of OH-STO tends to form nanocubes with the size of 30 nm (Fig. 3e). The calculated average d-spacings of STO and OH-STO are all 0.276 nm (Fig. 3e and 3f), associating to the (110) planes of SrTiO3, once again elucidating the pure SrTiO3 was obtained by low-temperature solid-state precursor method.[40] However, compared with STO, the lattice fringe edges of the OH-STO is blurry and disordered, further illustrated the existence of oxygen vacancies, which is consistent with the EPR result. Besides, the N2 adsorption-desorption analyses revealed that both products have type-IV curves, which are characteristic of mesoporous structures [29] (Fig. S5a). The BET surface areas of STO and OH-STO are 14.95 m2 g-1 and 21.76 m2 g-1, respectively. The slightly higher surface area of OH-STO supports that a small amount of interfacial adsorption of OH groups can modulate microporous structure (Fig. S5b) and promoting the formation of more mesoporous and macropores. The photocatalytic, piezocatalytic and piezo-photocatalytic H2 production of STO and OH-STO were conducted under simulated solar light irradiation and ultrasonic vibration with the addition of methyl alcohol (MeOH) as the sacrificial electron donor. As shown in Fig. 4 a, the amount of the photocatalytic H2 evolution for the two samples increases with illumination time. Both them have a rapid rise in the first reaction but slowly increase after one hour. After irradiation, the total quantity of the photocatalytic H2 production for OH-STO achieves 1027.8 umol g-1(Fig.4a), which is about 2 times higher than STO (564.4 umol g-1). In addition, the influence of the calcination temperature on the photocatalytic performance of SrTiO3 was also researched, the result demonstrated that the H2 production yield decreased as the temperature increased and 500°C is the optimum annealing condition (Fig. S6). To evaluate the piezocatalytic activity, a series of the blank experiment was conducted to exclude interference factors, as displayed in Fig. S7. There is a little H2 evolution yields under ultrasonic vibration without using any catalysts and light irradiation. In contrast, the amount of H2 production over STO and OH-STO can reach to 338.4 umol g-1 and 535.8 umol g-1 after ultrasonic vibration, respectively (Fig.4b), illustrating the good piezocatalysis activity of SrTiO3 and hydroxyl modification can also strengthen its piezocatalysis performance. Unsurprisingly, through the synergistic effect of the piezo-photocatalysis process, the OH-STO presented significantly enhanced H2 production performance and the yield is approximately 1390.4 umol⋅g-1 (Fig. 4c). For further study the effect of sacrificial agent on hydrogen evolution in piezo-photocatalytic process, the piezo-photocatalytic hydrogen generation experiment was performed without the addition of MeOH, as displayed in Fig. S8, the hydrogen production rate can be neglected, indicating the important role of MeOH in catalysis. As observed in Fig. 4d, the H2 evolution rate of OH-STO in piezo-photocatalysis is about 1.8 times higher than STO, which is 5.3 times higher than that of STO in photocatalysis. Meanwhile, no matter photocatalytic, piezocatalytic or piezo-photocatalytic, the optimal H2 production rate of OH-STO (295.4 umol h-1 g-1, 430.8 umol h-1 g-1, 701.2 umol h-1 g-1) are all much higher than STO (133.4 umol h-1 g-1, 272.0 umol h-1 g-1, 386.5 umol h-1 g-1). Furthermore, the piezo-photocatalytic activity of hydrogen production of OH-STO is superior to the H2 production rate of various piezo-photocatalysts (Tab. S5). All of which may due to the super hydrophilic that is facilitating the contact of catalytic and water molecular and the more oxygen vacancies that can promote charge separation. The durability and recycling performance of the catalyst is very important in practical application. As shown in Fig. 4e, the OH-STO displays a similar piezo-photocatalytic H2 production in three consecutive cycles. Meanwhile, the crystalline phase of OH-STO kept unchanged after cyclic tests, suggesting its preferable recycle capability and stability of catalysts (Fig. 4f). The optical absorption capacity and band structure of photocatalysts were tested by UV-DRS and Mott-Schottky. As shown in Fig. 5 a, the intrinsic steep absorption edges of two samples were observed near 380 nm, which is dependent on the band-band transition of SrTiO3.[40] After hydroxyl modification, the visible light absorption ability of OH-STO has improved and the band gaps (Eg) narrowed, as confirmed by the Tauc plots based on the Kubelka-Munk method.[41] As revealed in the inset of Fig. 5a, the Eg of STO and OH-STO are calculated at about 3.27 eV and 3.24 eV, respectively, which is resemblance to other reported values.[21,42] Mott-Schottky curves are measured and analyzed to further investigate the change of band structures for STO and OH-STO. The flat band potentials (Efb) of the materials are estimated according to the following [Eq. (3)].[43] (3) 1 C 2 = 2 e Îµ Îµ 0 N D E- E fb - K T e (4) EVB=Eg + ECB There are two important conclusions that can be reached: (i) both STO and OH-STO plots show positive slopes, suggesting an n-type semiconductor nature; (ii) the Efb could be read by extrapolating the Mott-Schottky plots to the x-axis (i.e., 1/C2 = 0), that is, the intercept values. As displayed in Fig. 5b and Fig. S9, even at different frequency, the resulting flat band potential (Efb) of STO and OH-STO are -0.62 V and 0.65 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. For n-type semiconductors, Efb is known to be located at 0.1 or 0.2 V below the CB potential (ECB).[44] Thus, the ECB values of STO and OH-STO are roughly estimated to be -0.82 and -0.85 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. Through conversion (ENHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.197 V), the ECB of STO and OH-STO are about -0.62 V and -0.65 V vs. NHE (normal hydrogen electrode).[40] The VB potentials (EVB) could be determined according to [Eq.(4)]. Thus, the EVB of STO and OH-STO are about 2.62 eV and 2.57 eV, respectively. It can be seen from the above results that the OH-STO of ECB shifted to a high energy level, which indicates that the photoreduction properties of OH-STO is better than STO, this is consistent with the results of XPS analysis. From the PL emission spectra excited at 320 nm (Fig. 5c), it is generally accepted that the PL emission spectrum is produced by generated by the recombination of charge carriers, which means that the lower the intensity of the PL spectrum, the more effective separation of electrons and holes.[28] As expected, OH-STO displayed a quenched PL intensity compared with STO, which indicates that the recombination of electrons and holes is effectively suppressed and OH-STO has higher photocatalytic activity. The SPV can also analyze the separation and transfer process of photo-generated carriers on the surface and interface of the catalyst. As exhibited in Fig. 5d, a remarkable strong SPV signal for OH-STO predicted that the photo-generated carriers can be separated and transferred significantly in spatial with the aid of an interfacial electric field.[45] The current density of STO and OH-STO have steadily increase or decrease with the light/ultrasound on or off in several continuous cycles (Fig. 5e and f), further indicating the good stability of SrTiO3. Moreover, no matter under light illumination or ultrasonic vibration, the current response of OH-STO is much stronger than STO, suggesting the OH modification can greatly promote the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Furthermore, OH-STO shows a significant enhancement of current signal under ultrasonic than under illumination, which is relevant to the formation of a built-in electric field by ultrasound facilitating carrier separation. EIS Nyquist plots were also performed on STO and OH-STO samples, the diameter of the arcs are in direct proportion to the resistance values of the electron transfer on the electrode.[46] As described in Fig. S9, the charge separation on OH-STO was significantly improved owing to a smaller diameter was found for the EIS Nyquist plot. This result further corroborated that the surface hydroxyl modification can significantly improve the charge separation and transfer in SrTiO3, and therefore enhanced photocatalytic activity. Based on the above results, a plausible mechanism of the enhanced piezo-photocatalytic activity for OH-modified SrTiO3 was deduced. As shown in Fig. 6 a and b, in the piezo-photocatalytic reaction system, more water molecules would be absorbed on the surface of OH-STO due to plenty of hydroxyl groups were attached on the surface of SrTiO3 and its high hydrophilicity, which is facilitating the production of more active sites for water splitting.[47] Meanwhile, the oxygen defect generated by hydroxyl modification can act as an electron trap to prompt the directed transfer of electrons and then facilitate the separation of electrons and holes.[48,49] Besides, with the help of the ultrasound vibration, the generated stress will induce the presence of positive and negative charges on the opposite surfaces of SrTiO3, forming a build-in piezoelectric field and accelerating the efficient charge separation. While the electrons generated by the built-in electric field on the surface can react with the surface hydroxyl group for hydrogen evolution.[50,51] Consequently, under the dual action of oxygen defect and internal electric field, abundant electrons would focus on the conduction band of SrTiO3, subsequently dissociating H2O molecules that absorbed on the surface of SrTiO3 and reducing H+ to generate H2. The coupling of surface OH functionalization and piezoelectric effect bring about a high H2 evolution."
8,Conclusions,"In summary, the OH-modified SrTiO3 were successfully synthesized via a low-temperature solid-state precursor method and employed as a catalyst for high efficiency hydrogen production under different conditions (photocatalytic, piezocatalytic and piezo-photocatalytic) for the first time. The hydroxyl modification can not only improve hydrophilicity that facilitates the contact of catalyst and water molecular but also generate oxygen defects that accelerate charges separation and transfer. Benefitting from this unique surface functional group modification scheme, the hydrogen production rate of OH-modified SrTiO3 can achieve 701.2 umol h-1 g-1 under simultaneous irradiation and ultrasound, which is much higher than only illumination (295.4 umol h-1 g-1) or vibration (430.8 umol h-1 g-1). More importantly, the photocatalytic, piezocatalytic and piezo-photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of OH-modified SrTiO3 are all about two times higher than pristine SrTiO3. This work presents a low energy consumption method for the rational design of piezo-photocatalytic materials. Thus, we anticipate that this facile and eco-friendly surface modified approach can be extended to other OH-modified perovskite-based nanomaterials and strengthen their piezo-photocatalytic performance."
