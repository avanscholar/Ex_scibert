0,Introduction,"Energy resource consumption is the most overwhelming challenge for human in the contemporary century [1]. Here into the consuming portion of building sector is estimated approximately at 20% of the total world energy use [2], and even about 40% of overall energy consumption is accounted for buildings in Europe [3]. The energy at high load usage seriously destroys the climate balance, easily resulting in global warming and extreme weather [4]. Accordingly, numerous reasonable attempts have been already implemented to develop renewable energy such as solar, hydrogen, and carbon-neutral fuels [5, 6]. The energy-saving potential of well-insulated houses can be achieved between 50 and 90% compared with the conventional ones [3]. Thus building insulation would be a major viable and cost-effective way to settle this energy issue in thermal demand and energy usage for heating and cooling purposes [7]. Recently several state-of-the-art insulation materials for reducing the energy demand of indoor temperature regulation are continuingly developed, including vacuum insulation panels (VIPs), gas filled panels (GFPs) and aerogels [8]. However, the utilities of VIPs and GFPs are always required for preventing air and/or moisture penetration into their pore structures during the service life. Contrarily, aerogels with highly nanoporous monolithic solid have increasingly attracted scientific and industrial interests due to their ultra-light weight, low thermal conductivity and high porosity. Biomaterials from naturally occurring resources can reduce greatly the overall carbon footprint and relieve the ecological load [9, 10]. Chitosan (CTS), a widely used polysaccharide depending on deacetylation of chitin, is one of the most abundant renewable biopolymers on the earth [11–15]. In this regard, CTS aerogels hold promise for engineering building insulation materials in energy-saving manner. So far, a great advance has been made by Takeshita's group, who prepared relative transparent and ductile CTS aerogels using formaldehyde as crosslinker [16]. Recently, CTS aerogels with high specific surface area have been reported by applying ethanol/water binary medium [17]. However, a long-term unanswered issue, how to efficiently inhibit sharp shrinkage (typically reaching ~80% of the hydrogel volume after extraction with SC drying [18]) still remains challenging for biomass aerogel in the stage from its final wet gel to aerogel. In some very typical and limited research advances, Shahi's group reported that chitosan/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) blends beads could be given the particular mechanical feature in biomedical applications [19]. Also, it has been confirmed that the intermolecular interactions between the PVA and chitosan indeed make the PVA/chitosan blend have excellent mechanical property, by Hu's group [20]. Herein, we launch an effective and reliable synthetic protocol to substantially restrain the uniaxial shrinkage of CTS aerogels using supramolecular interaction by introduction of linear PVA polymer and o-phthalaldehyde (OPA). Meanwhile, this work demonstrates that CTS aerogels endow low shrinkage response from final wet gel to aerogel, superior thermal conductivity, compressive property capable of practical applications. The origin of these unique traits is also discussed from supramolecular view and ‘hard segment’ theory, whose insights have not been reported previously. Additionally, this study paves a novel way to realize the large reduction of shrinkage (from final wet gel to aerogel) for biomass aerogel, conquering challenge on difficultly controlling shrinkage."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Chitosan (CTS, deacetylation rate: >80%; viscosity: 20–200 mPa·s at 5 g L−1; RT), acetic acid (AR), o-phthalaldehyde (OPA, AR), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and ethanol (AR) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. Deionized and doubly distilled water was employed in all experiments. All reagents in this study were used as received without further purification."
3,Synthesis of P/CA,"2.2 Synthesis of P/CA For the synthesis of P/CA (For simplicity, CTS aerogels trussed with and without PVA described here are labeled as P/CA and the Control (as control (blank) group) throughout the paper, respectively.), 300 mL of 8 g L−1 CTS solution with the binary solvents containing 2 wt% acetic acid/ethanol at 2/3, and 120 mL of OPA solution of 8 wt% were mixed in a soft cork bottle with the assistance of ultrasonication for 5 min at a cold environment to a homogeneous solution mixture. Then 120 mL of PVA solution (4 wt%) was added and blended with mechanical stirring for 10 min in the same temperature. Afterward, the aging treatment was conducted in each interval of 24 h from 10 to 70 °C with the temperature gradient of 10 °C, regularly exchanging the solvent of the gel with fresh ethanol to ultimately gain the ethanogel. Subsequently, the gel obtained was dried with CO2 supercritical (SC) fluid at 55 °C and 15 MPa, eventually to get P/CA."
4,Characterization measurements,"2.3 Characterization measurements X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) measurements were carried out for composition of the samples with a spectrometer (TESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific) employing Mg Kα radiation. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of all dried specimens were measured at 400–4000 cm−1 using pressed KBr pellets on a spectrophotometer (Nicolet 6700, Thermo Nicolet; Resolution: 2 cm−1). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were measured on a TTRAX III diffractometer (Rigaku) with Cu Kα radiation. The accelerating voltage and the applied current were 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. The surface structures and morphologies of the as-prepared specimens were observed using field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, S4800, Hitachi) operated at 10 kV. The thermal conductivity at varied pressures was tested with a sample with dimensions of Φ 39 × 15 mm by applying a Hot Disk TPS2500 apparatus with a 5465 sensor. Compression stress-strain curves were recorded by universal mechanical tester equipped with a 10 kN load cell at the compression rate of 0.5 mm/min. Thermal properties of specimens (3–5 mg) were measured by thermogravimetry (TG, Q500, TA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Q200, TA) from 30 to 500 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in air atmosphere."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Proposed reaction process and evidence confirmation,"3.1 Proposed reaction process and evidence confirmation The production strategy to synthesize low shrinkage (to indicate the stage from final wet gel to aerogel, similarly hereinafter) CTS aerogels in this work is essentially dependent of strong nanoscale network skeletons formed, especially ensuring the refined architecture design of interconnected geometry from the molecular point of view. Based on the above rationale, we propose an experimental solution for attaining CTS aerogels with low shrinkage as illustrated in Fig. 1a. CTS powder was first dissolved in ethanol/water binary solvent (containing acid) to form a homogeneous solution, and then linear PVA and a mild crosslinker OPA at predetermined concentrations were added stepwise in the above solution with the assistance of ultrasonication, consequently producing final wet gel after conducting chemical and/or physical crosslinking reactions, and the aerogel after SC drying process was gained as depicted in Fig. 1. How does the network of CTS aerogels construct? To start with, typical interaction: CHO groups from OPA enable to react with NH2 groups from CTS to form Schiff base NCH2 (1, 2 from Fig. 1b), to further form NCN (3 from Fig. 1b) crosslinking bonds by integrating another NH2 group as shown in Fig. 1b. To verify our hypothesis, we performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) characterizations to make clear the interface bonding and chemical composition of CTS aerogels from Fig. 2 . The peaks detected (Fig. 2a–c) at binding energies of 284.4 (C 1s) and 286.1 (C 1s), and 399.6 (N 1s) of P/CA originate from CN and CN, and NCN, respectively. The formation of these new bonds could be well ascribed to Maillard reaction between CHO and NH2 groups [21, 22]. As a reference, the XPS information of the Control has been also provided in Fig. 3 , wherein C 1s, N 1s and O 1s data are generally conformed to those of P/CA, stating clearly the existence of main chemical covalent bonds in forming network structures. As a comparison, FTIR spectrum of original CTS (Fig. 2d) signifies that the bands at 1633 and 1602 cm−1 correspond to the stretching vibration concerning amide (I) band (CN) and the scissoring vibration of -NH2 group, respectively. The band monitored at 3474 cm−1 assigns to the stretching vibrations for NH and OH [23]. In contrast to the pristine CTS, the P/CA (Fig. 2d) elucidates that the new band appeared at 1656 cm−1 corresponds to the stretching vibrations of CN and amide III (CN), saliently suggestive of the network formation on account of bonding interaction. Additionally, the possible free CHO band from OPA is not examined with a detectable amount level in P/CA by XPS and FTIR, suggesting the complete conversion to NCN and CN bands while properly reacted. Secondly, interdigitated interaction: aldol condensation reaction (4, 5 from Fig. 1c) with one-step or two-step method, including hydrogen bonding (6 from Fig. 1c) between OH and NH2 groups and possible van der Waals interaction of the bonds above [24]. The occurrence of two-type bands (Fig. 2d) at 3480 and 1120 cm−1 can be explained by intermolecular hydrogen bond and ether bond, partly due to the chemical contact between PVA and CTS, partly owing to their hydroxyl hydration process. Finally, self-crosslink interaction: hydroxyl condensation reaction (7 from Fig. 1d) of PVA itself, namely OH groups react with each other and their hydrogen bonding integration. Actually, it is found that the intensity of relative broad absorption between 3000 and 3600 cm−1 stemmed from OH stretching is decreased after crosslinking reactions, suggesting the dehydration course in the PVA itself [25, 26]. This integrated case is well comparable to the mechanism (Fig. 1c) and the evidence obtained (Fig. 2d). The microscopic texture of the Control (Fig. 4a and d) shows the interconnected network structure derived from chemically crosslinking reaction, and the further network nanostructure (Fig. 4b, c and e) can be formed by trussing with linear PVA chains, reflecting the double network architecture. In more detail, the interconnected CTS chains enable to form three-dimensional network (Fig. 4a and d) depending on long CTS chains and OPA as hard segment crosslinker, eventually generating porous bulk aerogels. It should be emphasized here that the above-mentioned aerogel may appear a shrinkage because of the collapse from the micro- and/or mesopores excited by capillary forces and/or weak support ability. In view of this, the interpenetrated network skeletons (Fig. 4c and e) are formed by applying linear PVA chains (Fig. 4b) based upon physical chain entanglement effect (such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals and chemical covalent crosslinking interaction, as already revealed in Fig. 1) at intermolecular and/or intramolecular level."
7,Nanostructure textural evaluation,"3.2 Nanostructure textural evaluation The microstructural characterizations of the Control and P/CA in Fig. 5 were conducted by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), which comprehensively exhibit a representative 3D interconnected network with gradually enlarging view. As a whole, the morphological structures of all above are comprised of fiber-like skeletons, presenting the formation of an interpenetrating network which entangles randomly to be a porous architecture as illustrated in Fig. 4d and e. The N2 adsorption-desorption curves show that the pore sizes are both focused upon the mesoporous range in Fig. 6 , whilst the pore distributions of the Control and P/CA are completely located in nanoscale (Fig. 7 ) range. From Table 1 , the specific surface areas and total pore volumes of samples are 307.68 and 425.92 m2 g−1, 0.9275 and 2.055 cm3 g−1, respectively. However, the relatively dense structure (Fig. 5a–c) of the Control is markedly found comparing with that (Fig. 5d–f) of P/CA, implying the likely relative easy shrinkage feature on practically macroscopic characteristic (from final wet gel to aerogel) in a great measure. Concretely, the texture of the Control tends to be fixed tightly (Fig. 5b) rather than the truss-like network makeup (Fig. 5e) of P/CA. From Fig. 1d, notably a high number of slice-fixed crosslinking networks are imparted, probably attributable to the physical/chemical interactions of linear PVA chains with OPA-crosslinked CTS. In other words, the P/CA, with the texture similar to a truss-like structure, may dramatically dominate the concomitant shrinkage characteristic to some extent due to the structural enhancement by virtue of linear polymer [27, 28]. Moreover, it is worthwhile that the crystalline intensity of P/CA alters apparently, almost disappearing at 11.6° (Fig. 8b), compared with those of CTS and PVA (Fig. 8a)."
8,Physical feature assessment,"3.3 Physical feature assessment The evident difference in appearance is clearly shown in Fig. 9 , the final wet gel containing ethanol solvent from the Control owns yellowish color (Fig. 9a), which originates from a Schiff base NCH2 groups [21]. With removing its solvent inside by SC fluid, the sample color (Fig. 9b) is further deepened, demonstrating the increase of crosslinking reactions despite undergoing a drying stage. Also, these results indicate that the architectural structure of the Control could be enhanced once more because of the existence of residual Schiff base in the gel. Individually, the P/CA (namely the Control trussed with PVA) shows white color regardless of its gel state (Fig. 9d) or the aerogel (Fig. 9e). The evidence above suggests that the addition of linear PVA chains in P/CA may facilitate the reactive activity (with free NH2 groups) between NCH2 groups and OPA-crosslinked CTS chains. Beyond such, we also observed a phenomenon that the apparent shrinkage of the Control was detected along radial and axial directions in Fig. 9b and c. The shrinkage of P/CA both along the radial and axial directions is not rather comparable to that of the Control as depicted in Fig. 9e and f. This could be attributed to supramolecular physical interaction by introducing linear PVA polymer chains and covalent crosslinking function. These practical characters justify well the previous designing rationale (Fig. 1) of CTS aerogels and support their expected morphologies (Fig. 4c and e). The resistance capacity to uniaxial linear shrinkage from the final gel to the aerogel is evaluated quantitatively in Fig. 10 . Shrinkage rates of the Control (Fig. 10a) along the axial and radial directions are up to 27.5 and 40.8% respectively. We can find an emergent phenomenon that the shrinkage trend happens easily along the radial direction in comparison with that along the axial one. While the shrinkage ratios aforementioned are still suppressed considerably comparing with that (>50%) of the conventional ones [16], this result could be ascribed to the crosslinker (OPA) adopted in this work which takes on the rigid ring of benzene, particularly leading to the axial direction robustness of the Control. At this point, how to achieve low shrinkage along the radial direction in response to SC drying is to be an important concern. Luckily, the shrinkage (Fig. 10c) of P/CA is sharply restricted within <20% along the axial and radial directions, which originates from the trussed effect by linear PVA chains. On the other hand, currently the available data only for shrinkage property of CTS-based aerogels is not yet reported, the shrinkage rates along the radial direction on best CTS aerogels reported are up to ~45% as shown in Fig. 10b [16]. Under the similar substance concentration of CTS, the density of data above is bigger than that of P/CA for 80.4%, meanwhile the shrinkage rate of P/CA is reduced at 38.2% comparing to the sample at a density of 175 mg cm−3. In other words, low shrinkage P/CA makes its density apparently declining due to the enhanced skeleton support effect. This evidence confirms that in this work the strategy by applying linear PVA chains and covalent crosslinking via OPA is not only an effective route in enhancing structural skeletons of biomass aerogels, but enable really to come true the inhibition role of shrinkage along both the radial and axial orientation. In association with the photographs in Fig. 9, a diagram from Fig. 10d mimics properly the shrinkage behavior from final wet gel to aerogel along different directions. As a result, a shrinkage modulation way for organic-based aerogels along a particular unixial direction has been built up, and further control method regarding shrinkage feature of organic-based aerogels is exploited continuingly in our laboratory. Aiming at building insulation use of biomass aerogels derived from CTS, thermal insulation property (Fig. 11 ) of P/CA and typical inorganic silica aerogels was assessed based on a thermal conductivity measurement using transient plane heat source technique (as visualized in Fig. 11d). The ability to realize the desired sizes as shown in Fig. 11c suggests that the superior machinable property of P/CA obtained, including other processing samples with particular shapes (Fig. 9, Fig. 12c and d). The thermal conductivity of 0.0271 W m−1 K−1 (Fig. 11b) was measured at a density of 0.097 g cm−3 at room temperature. This value is very comparable to that (0.0262 W m−1 K−1) of stationary air at 300 K [29], which is also lower than those of commercial insulators such as carbonized cork, mineral wools (0.03–0.05 W m−1 K−1) and polystyrene foams (0.03–0.04 W m−1 K−1) [30]. Because commercially aerogel-based insulation is not yet available in literature reported, comparing with the most widely used insulating material: commercially available polymeric insulation material of expanded polystyrene (EPS) (>0.28 W m−1 K−1) [31, 32], the thermal conductivity of P/CA sample owns still advantage. In addition, the thermal conductivities (Fig. 11a and b) of three different silica aerogels (the densities at 0.078, 0.096 and 0.145 g cm−3, respectively) are 0.0236, 0.0253 and 0.0264 W m−1 K−1, respectively. We noted that thermal conductivity of P/CA is also fairly near to that of silica at a similar density. The P/CA at different vacuum levels state clearly the evidence for the lowest value of 0.0151 W m−1 K−1 in thermal conductivity at a pressure of 10 Pa comparing with that (0.0154 W m−1 K−1) of silica aerogel at the same pressure. The entangled and interpenetrated nanostructures with a random orientation (Fig. 5), enabling to suppress significantly the gas conduction, can account for the low value of thermal conductivity at a pressure approaching vacuum. The mechanical characteristic including toughness and robustness needs to be soundly matched to the requisites in a practical application. The compression stress-strain curves (Fig. 12) of P/CA along the axial and radial directions (Fig. 12c and d), which are parallel to those of nonbrittle porous polymer foams [33]. Moreover, the P/CA can be compressed without any cracks or fractures within ~70% strain. The linear elasticity feature (insets in Fig. 12a and b) is revealed at low strains of <5 and 15% for the axial and radial directions, respectively. This is attributable to elastic deformation at early strain stage. A plastic deformation is triggered by interfacial slippage at joint locations between the skeletons, which may be responsible for a large strain up to 40–50%. Importantly, we discover that the addition of linear polymer is more beneficial to render as-prepared aerogel with linear elasticity at low strain range. On further expanding the strain to 70%, a significant stress increase is monitored due to densification of pore skeletons. For better suiting various temperature conditions, TG and DSC curves in Fig. 13 are presented in the range from room temperature to 500 °C, indicating that the upmost use temperature of P/CA is up to 225 °C. Accordingly the mechanical property of P/CA is fully satisfactory to the routine usage of thermal insulators at unevenly-varied ambient temperature."
9,Conclusions,"In conclusion, a new type of chitosan aerogel with ultra-low shrinkage from its final wet gel to aerogel, was prepared successfully from CTS and linear PVA polymer by using supramolecular interaction and covalent crosslinking. Unexpectedly this aerogel having branched truss-like structures are qualitative shrinkage-controllable in a way along the axial or radial orientation, also present a linear elasticity behavior within low strain range through introducing PVA. The resulting P/CA are provided with outstanding thermal insulation performance, moderate compressive property practically available and processing feature for special-shaped components. We anticipate that this general approach will advance the development of biomass aerogels with controllable low-shrinkage feature from final wet gel to aerogel, used for thermal insulator in energy-saving buildings."
