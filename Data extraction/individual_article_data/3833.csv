0,Introduction,"Catalytic conversion of carbon monoxide and hydrogen (syngas) to ethanol and/or higher alcohols is an attractive alternative for producing fuels and fuel additives that can partially replace fossil fuels in the transportation sector. Syngas can be produced from coal, natural gas or biomass, which results in a great flexibility [1,2]. Modified molybdenum sulfide catalysts are among the most interesting catalytic systems for higher alcohol synthesis (HAS). In addition to their sulfur resistance, they present high activity for the water–gas shift reaction and the rate of coking is slow [1,3]. The carbon–carbon bond formation to transform C1 to C2 species is the rate-determining step in HAS. Therefore, homologation or cofeeding of lower alcohols has been proposed to increase the production of higher alcohols [3,4]. An increased yield of ethanol and higher alcohols upon methanol addition has been reported mainly on Cu/ZnO catalysts [4–6]. Isotope labeling experiments indicate that both methanol and CO are incorporated into the ethanol product [7,8]. However, there is still no full agreement about the effect of methanol addition. Calverley and Smith have shown a decrease in higher alcohol yield when methanol is cofed together with syngas over K2CO3/Cu/ZnO/Cr2O3 [9]. Regarding modified molybdenum sulfide catalysts, the information is even scarcer. Santiesteban et al. found improved ethanol yields upon injection of methanol, together with an increased production of methyl formate, methyl acetate and, specially, methane [10]. A similar behavior has been reported in a patent from The Dow Chemical Company [11]. However, in the latter case, no information regarding hydrocarbon production is shown. The aim of this work is to study the effect of cofeeding methanol, in various concentrations, over K–MoS2 and K–Ni–MoS2 catalysts. To the authors' knowledge, there is no published information about this effect on nickel-modified alkali-doped molybdenum sulfide catalysts. The operating conditions in the study have been chosen in order to simulate the conditions of an industrial plant [12]."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation and characterization,"2.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization Two unsupported molybdenum-based catalysts were synthetized, containing either one or two promoters. The bipromoted catalyst (K–Ni–MoS2) was obtained by coprecipitation of Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O and (NH4)2MoS4 and further doping with K2CO3. The preparation procedure is described in detail in a previous paper by our group [13]. Briefly, the coprecipitation step produced a black precipitate that was aged, washed and recovered by centrifugation. This precursor was then dried, crushed, sieved to a pellet size of 45–250μm and doped with K2CO3 (45–250μm) through mechanical mixture. The final catalyst was obtained after thermal treatment at 450°C (ramp: 20°C/min) for 90min, under H2 flow (GHSV=1200NmL/h·gcatalyst). Thereafter, a second sieving was performed to discard particles with a pellet size above 250μm that could be formed during the heat treatment. The final sample was kept in a tightly closed container before being tested. The monopromoted catalyst (K–MoS2) was synthetized using the same procedure, but excluding the coprecipitation step and thus the doping with nickel. Detailed catalyst characterization is provided elsewhere, including TGA, ICP, XPS, N2-adsorption, XRD, SEM–EDX and TEM analyses [13]. In this previous study by our group, it was shown that both materials have a low surface area and contain mainly macropores. A number of key features are presented in Table 1 . As shown, the promoters have been successfully incorporated during catalyst preparation."
3,Catalytic testing,"2.2 Catalytic testing CO hydrogenation reactions were performed in a high-pressure fixed-bed tubular reactor operating in down-flow mode. Approximately 1.8g catalyst, diluted with 7.5g SiC (pellet size: 53–80μm), was used in the tests. The reactor was heated by an electric furnace and the temperature was regulated by a cascade control, with a sliding thermocouple in the catalyst bed and a second thermocouple in the oven. This control architecture, together with the dilution with SiC and an external aluminum jacket, allowed for a temperature profile along the bed within ±0.5°C of the set point. A premixed syngas with H2/CO ratio=1 and 4mol% N2 as internal standard was used in the experiments. The reaction conditions were: P=71bar, T=340°C and GHSV=6000NmL/h·gcatalyst. The catalysts were first stabilized, under the aforementioned conditions, to ensure steady-state was reached. The stabilization period varied from about 20h on stream (K–MoS2) to 40h on stream (K–Ni–MoS2). After the stabilization period, a He pocket (20mol%) was introduced in order to keep the syngas partial pressure constant when methanol was cofed. Thereafter, different concentrations of methanol were added by means of a HPLC dosing pump (Gilson 307). The liquid was evaporated before being mixed with the gaseous stream, immediately prior to the reactor. The different conditions used in the study are summarized in Table 2 . Note that in between each period of methanol addition a period without methanol cofeeding was run to check for deactivation. Product analysis was carried out using an on-line GC, equipped with one TCD and two FID detectors. The carbon mass balance closures were typically higher than 98%. More details about the reaction and analysis setup can be found elsewhere [14]."

5,Methanol addition on K–MoS2,"3.1 Methanol addition on K–MoS2 The effect of methanol addition on CO conversion over the monopromoted catalyst is shown in Fig. 1 . It should be noted that catalyst activity is fairly constant during the 6days of operation: after introducing the He pocket, the conversion remains stable around 13% in the periods without methanol cofeeding. Addition of methanol slightly influences the conversion of CO, with values of around 10% for the different concentrations of added methanol. The transient periods observed in Fig. 1 when changing the conditions (and also in the subsequent Figs. 2–4 ) might be explained by a combination of different factors: slow change in catalyst performance with time on stream; residence time in the reactor and the subsequent piping to the GC; time between each GC injection (approx. 90min); and required time to get the desired flow of methanol through the reactor when the pump is started or stopped. All these factors may contribute to a greater or lesser extent to the fluctuations observed after a change in conditions. However, each period was kept for at least 8h in order to be able to reach a pseudo-steady state. The changes in alcohol and hydrocarbon space-time yields (STY) are presented in Fig. 2. Unexpectedly, the introduction of methanol in the reactor system does not result in improved yields of alcohols, but decreases the production of both ethanol and 1-propanol. On the other hand, methanol has the opposite effect on hydrocarbon STY. Methanol cofeeding increases their production, this effect being more pronounced with increasing methanol concentration. A complete product distribution is shown in Table 3 , together with CO and net methanol conversions. The presented data represents the average of at least three gas composition measurements at the same reaction conditions and with carbon mass balance closures higher than 98%. The net conversion of methanol is appreciably higher than CO conversion. The selectivity to the different products follows the same trend that was described above for ethanol, 1-propanol, methane and ethane yields. Methanol cofeeding clearly reduces the production of the different alcohols, while increasing hydrocarbon selectivity. Methane comprises up to 65% of the products (C%, CO2-free basis) upon 10% methanol addition."
6,Methanol addition on K–Ni–MoS2,"3.2 Methanol addition on K–Ni–MoS2 The incorporation of a second promoter, nickel, on K–MoS2 changes the previously shown trends, regarding both activity and selectivity. In this case, catalyst activity is also stable throughout the experiment, with values of about 2.5% in the periods without methanol cofeeding (Fig. 3). It has been previously reported that the incorporation of nickel on alkali-doped MoS2 catalysts, despite increasing the selectivity to ethanol and higher alcohols, results in a lower activity [13]. Addition of methanol increases CO conversion on K–Ni–MoS2, unlike what occurs with K–MoS2. The increase is especially remarkable at high methanol concentrations: CO conversion increases from 2.5% to more than 10% when 10% methanol is added to the syngas feed. Regarding the effect of methanol on alcohol STY, the effect is still negative for low methanol concentrations. However, when the concentration increases to 5% and specially 10% the yields of both ethanol and 1-propanol are somewhat enhanced, as can be seen in Fig. 4-left. However, the great increase in hydrocarbon STY, mostly methane, must be taken into consideration (Fig. 4-right). Namely, there is a slight increase in alcohol production at the cost of a huge increase in methane STY. The performance of the bipromoted catalyst when different amounts of methanol are added to the system is summarized in Table 4 . A marked decrease in ethanol and higher alcohol selectivity is also obtained in this case. However, a direct comparison of selectivity values with the monopromoted catalyst cannot be made, since the results obtained with nickel-modified alkali-doped MoS2 catalysts depend on the CO conversion level [15] (and CO conversion values are rather different in both catalysts)."
7,Discussion,"Cofeeding of methanol is generally assumed to be a means of increasing the yield of higher alcohols, but there is no complete agreement about this effect on the different catalysts used in HAS. As previously mentioned, only few studies have addressed this topic despite the great variety of catalyst options. Although isotope labeling experiments reveal that methanol can be converted to ethanol over MoS2-based catalysts [10], our results mostly show a negative effect when methanol is introduced in the reaction system under realistic conditions of pressure and temperature (71bar and 340°C). The yield of ethanol and higher alcohols is particularly reduced when methanol is cofed over K–MoS2. A simplified scheme of the reaction pathways for the formation of alcohols and hydrocarbons from syngas is shown in Fig. 5 . In view of the results, it can be suggested that the methanol added to the system competes for adsorption sites with other reaction intermediates. It was previously reported that the chemisorption of CO and H2 and their reaction to obtain formyl species (route 1 in Fig. 5) were faster than the route involving methanol chemisorption and dehydrogenation (route 2 in Fig. 5) [16]. Therefore, the final effect of methanol addition would be a decrease in higher alcohol yield since the alternative route for HAS involving methanol as a reactant would be fairly slow at the studied operating conditions. When nickel is included in the catalyst formulation, high methanol concentrations in the feed result in an increase in ethanol and higher alcohol yield. A better performance of the bipromoted catalyst was expected since nickel promotion is known to increase higher alcohol production at the expense of methanol [17]. The last question that arises concerns the increasing amounts of hydrocarbons obtained upon methanol addition. This effect is observed in both the monopromoted and the bipromoted catalysts. It can be speculated, in light of the obtained results, that the formation of methane from methanol intermediates is the most favorable reaction pathway over K–MoS2 and K–Ni–MoS2 catalysts under the studied conditions. This hypothesis is in line with isotopic studies performed by Santiesteban et al. [10] over alkali-doped MoS2 catalysts at similar reaction conditions. Their results show that methane formation can occur through intermediates derived from methanol. Analogously, Christensen et al. [18] reported a higher hydrocarbon production upon ethanol addition over a K–Co–MoS2/C catalyst. In any case, it must be taken into account that different co-feeds may result in different reaction mechanisms. In that work, the authors observed an important growth of 1-butanol production rate with ethanol addition, which was explained by the existence of an alcohol coupling route (ethanol or ethanol-derived species condense and form 1-butanol). However, our experimental results do not show any singular increase in alcohol production. Therefore, there is no evidence of methanol condensation processes under the analyzed catalysts and conditions."
8,Conclusions,"This paper describes the effect of methanol cofeeding on higher alcohol synthesis over molybdenum sulfide-based catalysts. Concentrations of methanol ranging from 1.5% to 10% were evaluated and produced basically a negative result when the reaction is performed at 71bar and T=340°C. The effect in higher alcohol yield is negative (K–MoS2) or not significant (K–Ni–MoS2), while the amounts of methane and higher hydrocarbons produced in the reaction are clearly increased. Therefore, adding methanol to molybdenum sulfide-based catalysts under the studied operating conditions is not a suitable option for increasing the yield of ethanol and higher alcohols."
