0,Introduction,"Lignocellulosic biomass refers to plant biomass which is composed of cellulose (42–54%), hemicellulose (23–36%) and lignin (22–28%) [1]. Further hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose produce C6 and C5 sugars respectively, which is used for the synthesis and production of organic acids and various chemicals such as furfural (FUR), levulinic acid (LA), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) [2,3]. Converting hemicellulose (C5 sugars) to valuable chemicals using heterogeneous catalyst is less explored as compared to cellulose (C6 sugar). FUR is listed by the U.S. Department of Energy as one of the top 10 bio-based chemicals that can be used to substitute with petrochemicals [4,5] and has flexibility in the manufacture of various chemicals and fuels such as furfuryl alcohol (F. Alc), Furan, 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF), and Tetrahydrofuran (THF). 200000 tons of FUR is produces annually in the world from lignocellulosic biomass [6–8]. The largest FUR production takes place in China [2,9] followed by Brazil and South Africa [10,11]. Currently, FUR is producing from the acid-hydrolysis and xylose dehydration, which is available in large quantities in hemicellulose and further this FUR will convert into F. Alc (via hydrogenation reaction) and LA (rehydration reaction). The high hemicellulose content was found in corncobs, oat bran, wheat bran [12]. This transformation of xylose into FUR is being pursued by the Quaker Oats corporation which was first processed in 1921 [9]. Many industries are using older technology, which is limited the FUR production. Additionally, it has many drawbacks like energy efficient, environmental concern, and corrosion issue due to use of acid catalysts (HNO3, HCl). To solve these problems, several efforts have been made to increase FUR production by using heterogeneous acid catalysts and improve the efficiencies of reaction and catalyst separation [13]. The use of xylose as a model compound to manufacture FUR has been given considerable attention (Table 1 ). Various solvents such as H2O, Gamma-Valerolactone (GVL), Toluene, 2-sec-butylphenol (SBP) and CO2 as catalyst in water with a multiphasic extraction phase composed of THF and MIBK [14] were used with different types of homogenous and heterogenous catalyst for the conversion of xylose. GVL was found an efficient solvent for xylose conversion as compared to water [5,6]. On account of unique properties such as non-volatile, highly polar, miscible with organic solvents [15,16] of Ionic Liquids(IL), considerable interest has emerged in the application of ILs in the field of biomass conversion into value added products [17]. Zakrzewska et al. [18] summarised achievement in the production of 5-HMF as furanic compounds using IL. Peleteiro et al. [19–23] reported extensive work on catalytic conversion of xylose to furfural over IL as solvent & catalyst, achieved 73–83% furfural yield at 100–140 °C. However, scale up and industrial application of IL is hindered by its high cost & tedious process for recovery of IL. The biphasic system with water, THF and MIBK to produce the FUR from wheat straw under the reaction conditions with 50 bar CO2 pressure (initial) at 180 °C for 60 min was reported by Morais et al. [14]. They reported the furfural yield of 56.6 mol % and 62.3 mol % selectivity of FUR. Gallo et al. reported that xylose dehydration reactions occurred more rapidly in GVL than in water, which reduced degradation products, resulting in higher yields of FUR (70%) [6]. The GVL in water with H2SO4 as a catalyst to convert xylose to high FUR yield (80%) and reported that GVL and H2O co-solvent systems could further boost the conversion of xylose to FUR [5,24]. With the addition of NaCl, Marcotullio et al. obtained 81% FUR yield with 90% FUR selectivity from the 95% conversion of xylose to 50 mM HCL aqueous solution which indicated that the Cl- as catalyst promote the formation of the 1,2-enediol from the acyclic form of xylose. Thus, the subsequent acid catalyzed dehydration to furfural [25] but there is a major drawback from the use of homogeneous catalysts that they are difficult to remove from the reaction media and start corrosion in a reactor due to acid. To increase the FUR, yield some researchers have tried to use zeolites as catalysts. Zeolites are hydrated aluminosilicate minerals made from interlinked tetrahedra of alumina (AlO4) and silica (SiO4) considered a highly stable and active catalyst with strong acid sites, high surface area and porosity that affects FUR formation. Dumesic and co-workers [26] identified the use of a biphasic system consist of an aqueous layer and 2-sec-butylphenol (SBP) as an organic extraction layer, and claimed 78% FUR yield. Shi et al. reported SBA-15 and SBA-15-SO3-H in water-toluene system with 13.5% selectivity (SBA-15) and 73.9% (SBA-15-SO3-H) selectivity of FUR, respectively using 66 wt% catalyst loading [27]. The major drawbacks of using organic phase reactions using catalysts are difficulties associated with the product and solvent isolation of the catalyst. Others promising results using different heterogenous catalysts have also been reported. Xylose was dehydrated to FUR in an Iso-propyl alcohol (IPA) using H-ZSM-5 catalyst, with a yield of 20% due to reduced surface area and the pore size of the individual catalysts for the continued reactions [28]. So, to get the selective yield of FUR at low catalyst loading a stable and highly active catalyst needs to be found. As documented earlier, 25% and 52% of FUR yields were reported using H-USY and H-Beta (Si to Al molar ratio = 19) zeolite catalyst, respectively in IPA medium [28]. It is expected that, IPA will act as solvent for xylose dehydration as well as work as a hydrogen donor (no external hydrogen) for converting FUR to F. Alc. Recently, Otomo et al. [29] reported the effects of calcination over Beta (H-β) catalysts for the dehydration of xylose to FUR at 180 °C. They found that the Beta zeolite calcined at 750 °C showed a higher conversion of xylose than Beta zeolite calcined at 500 °C due to its larger number of Lewis acid sites. They also concluded that Beta calcined at 750 °C achieved 57% FUR yield at 3 h and was not significantly changed until the conversion reached 100% for 6 h, whereas Beta calcined at 500 °C showed a constant yield of 72% after 4 h. Even though there are the numerous reports available for the dehydration of xylose to FUR, the comparatively lower yield of FUR as well as FUR + F. Alc is a major drawback. The challenges associated with the further improvement in FUR & FUR + F. Alc yield have prompted our interest to modify H-β zeolite and examine the performance of modifying H-β zeolite in the dehydration of xylose to FUR. To the best of our knowledge, this is probably the first report where such a high yield of FUR as well as FUR + F. Alc was obtained from xylose using sulfonated H-β (H-β–SO3–H) catalyst in IPA. Bronsted acid sites play an important role in the dehydration of xylose towards FUR, but the supportive action of Lewis and Bronsted acid sites also showed a positive effect [27,30]. Whereas, the formation of humins, from secondary condensation reactions with FUR, should be avoided in order to increase the FUR yield [31]. In this study, dehydration of xylose to FUR and subsequent hydrogenation to F. Alc reactions in one step was studied in alcohol media with different solid acid catalysts such as H-USY, H–Y, H-β and H-ZSM-5. The effect of functionalization of sulfonic acid group on H-β catalyst was studied to further improve in furanic compound yield. Effect of different amount of sulfur loading, optimization of reaction parameters and catalyst reusability was also studied. Optimized data is related with the catalyst characterization data such as XRD, SEM, BET, TPD and CHNS. Reusability of H-β–SO3–H catalyst was also investigated."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials H-β Zeolite (SiO2:Al2O3 = 28), H-ZSM-5 (SiO2:Al2O3 = 50), H-USY (SiO2:Al2O3 = 15.28) and H–Y (SiO2:Al2O3 = 5.2) were purchased from Zeolyst international Inc., Netherlands. Iso-Propyl alcohol (IPA, 99%) and Xylose (99%) were purchased from Thomas Baker with, Mumbai (India). FUR (99%), F. Alc and LA of analytical grade were procured from Sigma-Aldrich, USA."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Sulfonated β zeolite was prepared according to reported literatures [32–34]. In typical synthesis of 2% sulfur loading on H-β, 5 g of H-β zeolite and 100 mL toluene was mixed together in a round bottom flask equipped with condenser, then 0.580 mL of 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTS) was added and subjected to thermal treatment at 70 °C for 8 h. After thermal treatment, catalyst was separated and washed with toluene and water, and dried at 90 °C for 10 h. Subsequently, dry product was added into 20 mL of H2O2 (50% w/v), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 8 h. The solid was filtered and washed with deionized water for three times. Finally, the obtained material was dried overnight at 90 °C. Final sample was designated as 2% H-β–SO3–H. Similar procedure was followed to prepare 3 wt% and 9.8 wt% sulfur loading on β zeolite, and named as 3% H-β–SO3–H and 9.8% H-β–SO3–H."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the catalysts powder were recorded on a P-Analytical system (model Xpert-PRO-1712) with monochromatic Cu-Kα radiation(λ = 0.154) in the 2θ range of 5°-50°for phase identification of crystalline material. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was performed using a microscope (LEICA Stereo Scan 440) for identification of morphology of heterogeneous catalysts. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) were performed on a SA 3100 analyser (Beckman Coulter, CA, USA) system which measures the specific surface area of materials. Prior to analysis, samples were degassed at 300 °C under vacuum. The Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model was used for the detection of pore volume size. The total acidity of catalysts was measured by NH3-TPD using Micrometrics-Autochem II 2920 system with a thermal conductivity detector. For this procedure, 0.1 g catalyst was pre-heated at 300 °C for 1 h in a helium flow at a rate of 30 mLmin-1. It was allowed to cool at 120 °C by 10% NH3–He at a rate of 20 mL min-1 for 1 h then it was flushed with helium, samples were finally heated to 800 °C at a ramp of 10°C min−1. CHNS (Carbon–Hydrogen–Nitrogen–Sulfur) analysis was performed using Flash EA 1112 Series instrument for the detection of sulfur content."
5,Catalytic performance,"2.4 Catalytic performance The xylose to FUR, F. Alc reactions were carried out in 25 mL sealed glass batch reactor. IPA has been used as a solvent for dehydration and hydrogen donor for hydrogenation (no external hydrogen) for this whole procedure because it reduces side reactions and has long carbon chains compared to other alcohols which easily convert xylose into FUR. In typical catalytic experiment, 12 mL alcohol media (IPA) was mixed with 0.47 g of xylose (40 g L-1) and 0.11 g of catalyst (25 wt%). Once after reaching the set point value of temperature (150 °C) from room temperature, zero h reaction time was started. After completion of reaction, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool at room temperature. The catalyst was separated from reaction mixture by centrifugation. Organic compounds such as FUR, F. Alc and LA from reaction mixture were detected by using Gas Chromatograph (Chemito-1000) equipped with capillary column (30 mm × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm) and flame ionization detector (FID). The temperature of GC column was initially kept at 230 °C for 20 min and then raised by 15°C min−1 and held at 260 °C for 5 min. UHP grade N2 was used as carrier gas with 4.5 mL min-1 flow rate. The unconverted xylose after reaction was calculated with the use of high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC, Agilent1260 infinity II) equipped with column HPX-87 H and refractive index detector. For the product analysis, 0.1% H2SO4 aqueous solution was used as a mobile phase with 0.3 mL min-1 flow rate. The column temperature was set at 70 °C and UV detector was set at 250 nm. The xylose conversion into FUR, F. Alc and LA product yield were calculated by following equations: Conversion of Xylose ( mol% ) = Initial mol of xylose − Final mol of xylose Initial mol of xylose × 100 Product ( FUR / F . Alc / LA ) Yield ( mol% ) = mol of product formed Initial mol of xylose × 100"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Fig. 1 shows powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of H-β and sulfonated H-β. The XRD patterns of H-β shown characteristic peaks of Beta phase at 2θ = 7.6° and 22.4° which indicate that parent H-β zeolite is pure without any contribution of other phases. XRD pattern of sulfonated β shows similar peaks as that of H-β. No new peak was found after sulfonation, indicates that sulfonic acid group grafted onto β zeolite framework did not change the original structure. However, significant drop of peak intensities was observed in XRD pattern for 9.8% H-β–SO3–H, which indicate loss of crystallinity at high sulfur loading. Damage of Beta structure is not likely because Beta zeolite is stable in acidic condition, thus drop of peak intensities are attributed to the excessive grafting of sulfonic SO3–H group onto crystal structure. SEM was performed to investigate the morphology and size of the H-β sample and different dosages of sulfonated H-β (Fig. 2 ). It has been observed that sulfonation treatment does not alter the mixed surface morphology of catalyst. However, percentage of sulfonic acid on zeolite framework was increased with increase in dosing of sulfonating agent (2%, 3%, 9.8% H-β–SO3–H). Additionally, the particles of zeolites was agglomerated with increase in sulfonating agent, resulted decrease in surface area and pore volume from parent H-β to 9.8% H-β–SO3–H [35]. Table 2 shows the surface properties of parent H-β and different sulfonated samples. The surface area and pore volume of the parent H-β were 601.1 m2 g−1and 0.5221 cm3 g-1, respectively. It is observed that with increase in sulfur loading the total surface area, external surface area, total pore volume and mesoporous pore volume are continuously decreasing which clearly indicate that SO3–H groups was grafted inside the pores and external surface. Incorporation of SO3–H group in H-β decreases total surface area to 550.9 m2 g-1 (2% H-β–SO3–H), 479.4 m2g-1 (3% H-β–SO3–H) and 449.6 m2 g-1 (9.8% H-β–SO3–H). The mesoporous surface area (Smeso) was also decreased by 1.0%, 13.9% and 48.0% as compared to parent H-β for 2%, 3% and 9.8% H-β–SO3–H samples, respectively. This clearly indicated that above 3% SO3–H loading, pores are getting blocked severely to 48.0% as compared to only 13.9% with 3% SO3–H. Similar trends are observed for other physico-chemical properties of SO3–H functionalized H-β samples. Thus, it can be concluded that upto 3% insertion of SO3–H group has changed H-β properties marginally whereas above 3%, substantial blockages of H-β pores is observed. Elemental analysis of sulfonated H-β zeolite was performed through CHNS analysis to confirm the sulfur group grafted on catalyst. The actual and theoretical (theo.) sulfur content is also tabulated in Table 2. It is observed that actual S content was increased with theoretical percentage indicating the structure of MPTS was successfully grafted onto zeolite. There was a major difference in input and output sulfur content which indicate that the microporous structure is restricting grafting of SO3–H group due to the larger size of MPTS. This also evidenced by marginal decreased of microporous surface area (Smicro ) by 11.9%, 14.1% and 23.3% for 2%, 3% and 9.8% H-β–SO3–H samples, respectively. This indicates that a small rise in MPTS loading was observed above 3% H-β–SO3–H grafting. Fig. 3 display the NH3-TPD curves for parent and sulfonated H-β catalysts to measure the acidity of catalyst. TPD is method of observing desorbed molecules from a surface when the surface temperature was increased. The parent H-β zeolite exhibited two desorption peaks in the range 120°C-300 °C, and 300°C-500 °C, which are attributed to the weak and strong acid sites, respectively. The total acid amounts of acid sites were calculated by peak splitting which are shown in Table 3 . As sulfur loading were increased the intensities of peaks were radically increased, suggesting that sulfonic acid groups were successfully grafted onto the zeolite framework, while the positions of peaks remained same. Cheng et al. described that increase in sulfur content the total acid amount of catalyst was enhanced for Sulfonated Y zeolite [35]. It is seen from Fig. 3, the total acid amount was significantly increased up to 3.04 mmol g−1 (3% H-β–SO3–H) which is 4.39 times as compared to parent H-β (0.69 mmol g−1) at 3% (theo.) sulfur loading on H-β. Further increase in sulfur loading up to 9.8% H-β–SO3–H, total acidity was increased to 3.71 mmol g−1 (5.37 times), but it might have blocked mesopores with excessive grafting of sulfur group which can be seen with decrease of surface area (449.6 m2 g−1) and total pore volume (0.35 cm3 g−1) then parent H-β (601.1 m2 g−1, 0.52 cm3 g−1). Among the weak and strong acidities (Table 3), weak acidity has increased by 5.67 times (0.96 mmol g−1 -3% H-β–SO3–H) and 6.52 times (1.11 mmol g−1- 9.8% H-β–SO3–H) as compared to parent H-β (0.17 mmol g−1) whereas strong acidities have shown rise of 3.97 and 4.99 times as compared to parent H-β for 3% and 9.8% H-β–SO3–H, respectively. It looks that major rise in acidity happened in 3% H-β–SO3–H. Above, 3% the more MPTS insertion is limited and it will be washed out from H-β pore as well as from surface."
8,Screening of catalysts,"3.2 Screening of catalysts As mentioned above, zeolites have a strong catalytic property including high surface area, high acid sites and thermal stability. Thus, series of different zeolites such as H-ZSM-5 (SiO2 to Al2O3 molar ratio = 50), H–Y (SiO2 to Al2O3 molar ratio = 5.2), H-USY (SiO2 to Al2O3 molar ratio = 15.28) and H-β (SiO2 to Al2O3 molar ratio = 28) zeolites were screened for one step xylose dehydration and hydrogenation to furanic compounds especially FUR and F. Alc (Scheme 1 ) at 150 °C for 7 h with 25 wt% catalyst loading are shown in Fig. 4 . Initially, the reaction was performed without catalyst (blank) at 150 °C for 7 h. A negligible conversion of xylose was observed where minimal % of FUR (1%) and F. Alc (0.17%) formed, indicates that without catalyst there was no yield of FUR + F. Alc. This dehydration reaction of xylose to FUR was catalyzed by strong acid sites [36]. Xylose conversion follow trend of H-β (80%) > H-USY (65%) > H–Y (57%) > ZSM-5 (45%) > Blank (5%). Similar trends were observed for FUR, F. Alc and LA formation. Among the tested catalysts, the large pore (0.522 cm3 g−1) H-β zeolite achieved highest xylose conversion of 80% with FUR yield of 59%, F. Alc yield of 10% and 5.8% yield of LA compared to other studied catalysts. H-ZSM-5 medium pore zeolite (0.27 cm3 g-1) has surface area of 434 m2 g−1 leads to FUR yield of 19.5% and F. Alc yield of < 5%, may be due to medium pore and lower acidity of catalyst compared with H–Y, H-USY and H-β. H-USY, H–Y achieved low FUR + F. Alc yield due to different features and less acidic in nature as compared to H-β (Tables 2 and 3). The addition of catalyst in reaction promoted formation of FUR by enhancing chemical bond cracking of xylose to form FUR by dehydration. Therefore, H-β showed higher activity among all these tested catalysts due to the strong Bronsted acid sites and high surface area. Hence, H-β was found to be an optimum catalyst for the dehydration of xylose to FUR in alcohol media. Further functionalization of SO3–H group on H-β catalyst with different concentration of MPTS were studied to improve the activity or Bronsted acidity of H-β catalyst. Iglesias et al. reported similar results with this solid acidic catalyst [28]. Various zeolites were screened with different pore sizes in which H-β (Si to Al molar ratio = 19) showed higher catalytic activity of FUR (52%) yield among all zeolites at 150 °C for 7 h with 25% catalyst loading."
9,Effect of sulfur loading,"3.3 Effect of sulfur loading Fig. 5 shows the influence of the sulfur content on H-β at 150 °C for 7 h. The 3% H-β-SO3-H (3% S–B) was produced 76.8% FUR with 13.5% F. Alc and 4.13% LA, which is 19% (FUR) and 2% (F. Alc) higher than parent catalyst. 12% jump was also noticed in the xylose conversion. On increasing dosage of sulfonating agent up to 9.8% H-β–SO3–H (9.8% S–B) there was marginal increase in FUR yield by 1% with 79% at identical formation of F. Alc. The conversion of xylose to FUR were consistently increased with increase of total acid sites by sulfonation from 0.69 mmol g−1 (parent catalyst) to 3.04 mmol g−1 (3% H-β–SO3–H) (Table 3) which helps to catalyse the dehydration step effectively. Further elevation of sulfur amount (9.8% S–B) retained the conversion and yield were nearly constant though total acid amount was increased to 3.71 mmol g−1. Due to over dosing of sulfur, the mesoporousity of zeolite was blocked by 41% (Table 2). XRD results also support to this statement, where crystallinity of 9.8% sulfonated sample was radically reduced may be due to surplus quantity of sulfonic acid group could not be grafted stably onto zeolite (Fig. 1). Thus, 3% H-β–SO3–H catalyst has a proper balance acidity, and meso-porosity which exhibited the best catalytic results. Hence, further optimization of reaction parameters was studied on 3% H-β–SO3–H (3% S–B) catalyst."
10,Effect of catalyst loading,"3.4 Effect of catalyst loading To achieve higher yield of FUR and subsequently F. Alc, the catalyst loading is one of the important parameter to speed up the dehydration reaction [28]. The effect of catalyst amount on product yield was evaluated from range of 15%–50% and their results are presented in Fig. 6 . Increase in catalyst dosage from 15% to 25% increases FUR yield from 68.3% to 76.8%, F. Alc from 6.5% to 11.7% and LA from 2.9% to 4.3%, respectively. It was found that at 50% catalyst loading FUR is further hydrogenated in isopropanol medium (act as hydrogen donor) to F. Alc formation of 18% at identical LA formation. This happened due to rise in available active acid sites. At 25% catalyst loading the FUR to F. Alc formation ratio was 6.56, whereas at 50% catalyst loading FUR to F. Alc ratio was dropped down to 3.67 (almost by 50%). This also proved that present catalyst is useful for the formation of F. Alc also just by altering catalyst percent. Thus, it gives a new information that 3% H-β-SO3-H catalyst is performing two successive reaction of xylose dehydration as well as FUR hydrogenation to F. Alc in which IPA is acting as solvent for dehydration step and hydrogen donor for hydrogenation step with marginal rehydration to LA."
11,Effect of temperature,"3.5 Effect of temperature Catalytic performance of 3% H-β–SO3–H for the conversion of xylose to FUR and F. Alc was studied with varying reaction temperature (140°C-170 °C) while keeping other parameters constant. Xylose dehydration rate increases with increasing temperature which improves the FUR and F. Alc yield with increasing temperature (Fig. 7 ). It was observed that FUR yield was increased from 54.3% to 76.8% and F. Alc yield from 4% to 11.7% with increasing temperature from 140 °C to 150 °C, respectively. As the temperature was further increased upto 170 °C, FUR yield was decreased to 68.1% at identical F. Alc formation of 12%. This may be due to humins formation at higher temperature. Iglesias et al. also reported the 150 °C is an optimum temperature for their study with H-β zeolite and achieved maximum FUR yield (52%) [28]."
12,Effect of reaction time,"3.6 Effect of reaction time The effect of reaction time was studied using the 3% H-β–SO3–H at 150 °C with 25% catalyst loading as shown in Fig. 8 . The reaction time was varied from 2 h to 8 h to identify the best reaction time to achieve high FUR yield. In all cases xylose conversion was almost constant ~96.8%. The increasing trends of FUR and F. Alc formation as a function of reaction time was noticed. It was also observed that FUR yield was 50% at 2 h. With the rise in time upto 7 h FUR yield increased from 50% to 76.8%, and F. Alc of 11.7% as well as 4.35% of LA were found. Later 7 h reaction time, the decreasing trend of in FUR yield was observed. This may be due to the presence of humins formation in the reaction, which causes problems to dehydration of xylose in FUR. With the time, FUR can decompose to other products [37]. The maximum yield of FUR was obtained at 7 h. With plane H-β catalyst, similar trend was reported by Iglesias et al. [28]."
13,Catalyst reusability,"3.7 Catalyst reusability The catalytic reusability test was examined over 3% H-β-SO3-H catalyst and results are shown in Fig. 9 . The FUR yield of fresh catalyst was 76.8% and F. Alc of 11.7% (25% catalyst loading). After 1st run, the catalyst was used without regeneration and found that FUR yield drops to 55% with nil formation of F. Alc. Therefore, the catalyst was generated using acetone and H2O2 methods to improve activity of used catalyst. In 1st case, regeneration of recovered catalyst with acetone (10 mL) was done and dried at 90 °C for overnight. The regenerated catalyst improved FUR yield to 65% from 55% with 3% formation of F. Alc. In 2nd case, the regeneration of recovered catalyst was performed with 10 mL of H2O2 (50 wt%) with 8 h stirring at room temperature. The H2O2 regenerated catalyst gave ~63.2% FUR and 3% F. Alc yield, respectively which clearly indicates that the treatment with H2O2 at 8 h was not very effective for the regeneration process, therefore catalyst regeneration stirring time was increased up to 24 h. After 24 h stirring with H2O2, the colour of the used catalyst became like fresh (Fig. 10 ) and FUR yield was improved to 71.1% which was nearly close to 76.8% (fresh catalyst). This shows that with acetone treatment some amount of deposition of carbon was removed (Table 4 ) but it was not an effective method and it indicates that H2O2 treatment is regaining the FUR yield after 1st run. With total 3 recycle run FUR and F. Alc yield was dropped by 25% which indicates that after every run the acid sites are getting dropped which affect activity."
14,Conclusion,"In this study, the sulfonated H-β zeolite was successfully prepared, characterized and their catalytic activity was estimated for one step conversion of xylose to furanic compounds especially FUR (by xylose dehydration) and F. Alc (by hydrogenation in IPA medium) with marginal rehydration reaction. The various zeolitic heterogenous acid catalysts were scrutinized in IPA as a solvent (hydrogen donor). Among all the tested zeolite base catalysts, H-β exhibited highest FUR and F. Alc yield due to large pore size structure of beta zeolite. The parent H-β was further modified by incorporating sulfonic group (SO3–H) inside H-β pores to improve of acidity of catalyst. The 3% H-β-SO3-H catalyst displayed the maximum conversion of xylose (90%) and highest yield of FUR (76.8%), F. Alc (11.7%) using 25% catalyst loading at 150 °C for 7 h. The FUR to F. Alc ratio was 6.56. The reusability of 3% H-β–SO3–H catalyst indicates that H2O2 with 8 h was not enough. However, catalyst generated for 24 h in H2O2 at room temperatures helps to regain catalytic activity like fresh and recycle upto 3 cycles with drop-in activity by 25%. This study reveal that 3% H-β–SO3–H catalyst can be effectively use for converting xylose in to furanic compounds especially furfural and furfuryl alcohol in IPA medium gives highest yield of furanic compounds."
