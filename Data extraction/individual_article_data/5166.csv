0,Introduction,"The increase in energy demand and decrease in fossil fuel resources need to develop biofuels production process from renewable energy sources. Biofuels can be produced from biomass, fat, and vegetable oils (Albashabsheh and Heier Stamm, 2019; Istadi et al., 2021; Kazemi Shariat Panahi et al., 2019; Suchamalawong et al., 2019). However, fatty acids group vegetable oils are the most used feedstocks due to their availability to be processed through transesterification and cracking processes. The transesterification process produces a fatty acid alkyl ester (biodiesel) as the main product and glycerol as a by-product (Buchori et al., 2017). However, the cracking process is the preferred process due to its high performance in fatty acid conversion, either thermal or catalytic cracking. Many studies reported that the cracking process produces wide carbon ranges of hydrocarbons as biofuels, including gasoline, kerosene, and diesel ranges (Istadi et al., 2021). Furthermore, the fractionated fuels product from the cracking process can be directly used as bio-gasoline, bio-kerosene, or biodiesel/green-diesel and do not need to be mixed with the fossil fuels (Sousa et al., 2018). Palm oil is the most favorable vegetable oil as a feedstock for biofuels production due to the high content of long-chain hydrocarbon (Istadi et al., 2020a), the relatively equal ratio of saturated and unsaturated oil content giving significant contribution to aromatic compounds in the liquid product (Beims et al., 2018; Pande et al., 2012), and abundantly available in the world especially Indonesia and Malaysia regions. Some cracking processes of vegetable oils to biofuels (gasoline-kerosene-diesel hydrocarbons ranges) or fossil oils to lower hydrocarbons were developed include hydrocracking, or hydrocracking-deoxygenation (Al-Muttaqii et al., 2019; Mirzayanti et al., 2018; Trisunaryanti et al., 2020), catalytic cracking (Istadi et al., 2020a; Siregar and Amin, 2006), or plasma-assisted cracking (Gharibi et al., 2015; Istadi et al., 2020b; Khani et al., 2015; Riyanto et al., 2020). The cracking or catalytic cracking reactions involved are quite complicated over mostly the solid acid catalysts and conducted at around 450 °C (Riyanto et al., 2020). The main cracking product is gasoline-range and/or diesel-range hydrocarbons containing paraffins (alkane), olefins (alkene), and aromatic hydrocarbons. Other by-products are water and carbon dioxide. Previous studies suggested that the catalysts with moderate acidity led to the formation of gasoline range liquid fuels type, and catalysts with stronger acidity led to producing substitutes for gasoline (bio-gasolines) type (Rabie et al., 2018). However, several problems remain in this case and deserve attention (like oxygen content, sulfur content, unbalance of paraffin, olefin, and aromatic content). The sulfur content strictly depends on the feedstock properties. On the other hand, the oxygen, aromatic, olefin, and paraffin content depend on both feedstock properties and catalysts properties used. Meanwhile, reducing oxygen contents in the liquid fuel product was also expected. Some previous studies found that hydrocracking could convert vegetable oils into biofuels with high product yield and low oxygen content (Huber et al., 2007; Tanneru and Steele, 2015; Zhao et al., 2015). They found that the introduction of hydrogen on the catalytic cracking of palm oil can break the double bond of triglyceride and remove the oxygen content of the triglyceride (deoxygenation) when using a suitable catalyst. Deoxygenation of palm oil can be conducted through hydrodeoxygenation which is mainly targeted by contacting hydrogen gas with the triglyceride, causing a reaction between hydrogen and oxygen-contented in the triglyceride which in turn removing oxygen content in the fuel products over the suitable catalysts. Other alternative mechanisms of deoxygenation reaction in the catalytic cracking process are decarboxylation and decarbonylation (Istadi et al., 2020a) to produce alkanes and alkenes compounds releasing CO2 and CO, respectively. However, this mechanism highly depends on the active site of the catalysts. It was reported that the deoxygenation reactions (decarboxylation and decarbonylation) were highly supported by the Lewis acid site on catalysts (Istadi et al., 2020a). With respect to the development of suitable catalysts for the hydrodeoxygenation reaction, some previous studies reported that the most catalysts suitable used for the catalytic cracking process are the acid-type catalysts (Hengsawad et al., 2018; Istadi et al., 2020a), particularly the zeolite-based catalysts. Most catalytic cracking studies focused on synthesizing the acid catalysts from fresh materials or using commercial zeolite catalysts. Moreover, it has been discovered that the hydrocracking process is favorably conducted over low-Brønsted acid site content. Kazakov et al. (2019) reported that the recrystallized USY zeolite catalyst with a lower Brønsted acid site has significantly higher activity in hexadecane hydrocracking. On the cumene hydrocracking process, Sazegar et al. (2015) reported that cumene hydrocracking highly depends on the number of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites. Regarding the utilization of the Spent Residue Fluid Catalytic Cracking (SRFCC) catalyst, the SRFCC catalyst waste still has lower cracking performance due to catalyst deactivation during the industrial cracking usage process previously. The catalyst deactivation is due to lowering the acid active sites and the coke pore blocking. Previously, we have regenerated the Brønsted/Lewis acid sites on the SRFCC catalyst by some acid treatments, which in turn, the catalyst can be reused as a good catalyst for palm oil cracking to liquid fuels. The characterization of this catalyst enhancement and catalyst testing for conventional cracking process “without hydrogen introduction” has been published elsewhere (Istadi et al., 2020a). However, the detailed testing of the enhanced SRFCC catalyst for the hydrocracking process with respect to the effect of hydrocracking, deoxygenation, or hydrodeoxygenation reaction catalyst supporting the catalytic cracking of palm oil to biofuels needs to be explored here. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, the catalyst testing studies of the enhanced SRFCC catalyst for the hydrocracking process with respect to the effect of hydrocracking, deoxygenation, or hydrodeoxygenation reaction catalyst is still limited. On the other hand, based on the understanding of the hydrocracking process explained above; hence, this study focuses on the role of catalyst acidity and acid type on acid-treated SRFCC catalysts on the hydrocracking process of palm oil regarding the hydrocarbon formation and deoxygenation process. Some other parameters, including hydrogen flow rate and reactor temperature, are also studied comprehensively."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials of research,"2.1 Materials of research The catalysts used in this study were acid-treated SRFCC waste catalysts. The SRFCC waste catalyst was obtained from a petroleum company. In order to treat the catalysts, sulfuric acid (96%, Merck) and citric acid (99%, Merck) were used. The performance of the catalysts was tested through the hydrocracking reaction of palm oil to produce lower carbon ranges of hydrocarbons. The feedstock used in this study was the refined palm oil bought from the local market. The chemical composition of palm oil used in this study is presented in Table 1 . Hydrogen gas (99.99% purity) was used for the hydrocracking process. In order to flush all tubes and reactor, a nitrogen gas (99.99%) was used as the flushing agent."
3,Catalysts preparation and characterization,"2.2 Catalysts preparation and characterization The SRFCC waste catalyst was treated using acids solutions, 3 M of citric acid, 3 M of sulfuric acid, and 3 M of the mixture of both acids (1:1). Before the acid treatment, the SRFCC waste catalyst was calcined at 550 °C for 4 h and then denoted as SRFCC-NT. After the acid treatment, the SRFCC catalysts were washed using demineralized water and then dried at 110 °C for 24 h in an electric oven (Memmert). The dried acid-treated SRFCC catalysts were calcined at 550 °C for 4 h in a muffle furnace (NEY VULCAN 3-550). Furthermore, the SRFCC waste catalysts were denoted as SRFCC-CT for the catalyst that was treated using the citric acid solution, SRFCC-ST for the catalyst that was treated using the sulfuric acid solution, and SRFCC-MT for the catalyst that was treated using the mixture of the citric and sulfuric acid solution. The detailed acid treatment procedure for the SRFCC catalyst preparation was described in the previous study (Istadi et al., 2020a). The catalysts were characterized using several characterization methods. The catalysts properties, such as surface area, pore-volume, and pore size, were identified using the N2 gas physisorption method (ChemBET PULSAR Quantachrome). The surface area of the catalysts was determined using the Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) surface area method. The pore volume and the average pore size of catalysts were determined using the Barrett−Joyner−Halenda (BJH) method. In order to calculate the external surface area of the catalysts, the t-plots method was used. The acidity of the catalysts was analyzed using Pyridine-probed Fourier Transform Infrared (Pyridine-FTIR) spectroscopy. The Brønsted and Lewis acid sites can be determined by the presence of the bands around 1545 and 1455 cm−1, respectively."
4,Performance test of catalysts for hydrocracking process,"2.3 Performance test of catalysts for hydrocracking process Performance of the acid-treated SRFCC catalysts was tested through the hydrocracking process of palm oil to biofuels or organic liquid products (OLP) in a continuous fixed-bed reactor. The scheme of the experimental setup for testing catalysts for the hydrocracking process is shown in Fig. 1 . The acid-treated SRFCC catalysts (5 g) were put in a tubular reactor made of stainless steel with an inside diameter of 1 in. The preheater temperature was set and controlled at 320 °C, while the catalytic reactor was heated up to the varied temperatures (450, 500, and 550 °C) using an electric furnace. The catalyst was put inside the center of the reactor. In order to flush the existing oxygen gas content inside the experimental rig tubes and reactor column, the nitrogen gas was flowed through the tube for 30 min. The palm oil feedstock was fed to the reactor system through the preheater by using a peristaltic pump at Weight Hourly Space Velocity (WHSV) of 0.365 min−1. The WHSV is the ratio of the mass flow rate of the feed and the mass of catalysts. After the reaction temperature was achieved as the variable, the hydrogen gas was fed to the reactor as a hydrocracking agent with flow rates of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 NL/min. The cracking product exit from the reactor was condensed in a chilled-water condenser. The condensed liquid fuel products were separated with the uncondensed by-product gas in a liquid-gas separator. The liquid fuel products were collected in a flask for further analysis as a raw biofuels product called Organic Liquid Product (OLP). The raw biofuels product was collected during the first 3 h (the basis of performance calculation) after a steady state was achieved (30 min after the reaction was started). The collected liquid fuels/OLP as a raw product were then analyzed using the gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) method (QP2010S SHIMADZU, DB-1 column) to determine the composition of the components. The samples were analyzed at 50 °C oven temperature (hold for 5 min) and ramped 10 °C/min to 260 °C and held for 33 min. In order to evaluate the performance of the catalytic hydrocracking process, some parameters, such as palm oil conversion, biofuels product yield, and selectivity, were used. The palm oil conversion (X), the yield of OLP, gas, and coke (Y i ), and selectivity of the mixed gasoline, kerosene, and diesel fraction (S j ), were calculated using the following equations: (1) X % = m feed − m unreacted feed m feed × 100 (2) Y i % = m i m feed × 100 (3) S j % = m j m feed − m unreacted feed × 100 where m feed is the mass of palm oil fed, m unreacted feed is the mas of unreacted palm oil, m i is the mass of component i (in OLP, gas, and coke phases), and m j represents the mass of component j (mixed gasoline, kerosene, and diesel). The gasoline, kerosene, and diesel fraction were categorized based on carbon ranges of hydrocarbons from the GC–MS analysis results as reported elsewhere (Istadi et al., 2021, 2020a), where C5 – C12 ranges were categorized as a gasoline fraction, C13 – C14 ranges were categorized as a kerosene fraction, and C15 – C18 ranges were categorized as diesel fraction."
5,Results and discussions,
6,Catalysts properties,"3.1 Catalysts properties The SRFCC catalyst waste, a zeolite-based catalyst, was deactivated during the commercial usage for the industrial cracking process and was included as hazardous waste because of many heavy metals content (Ferella et al., 2019; Marafi and Stanislaus, 2011). However, this catalyst can still be reutilized after the re-improvement process, such as acid treatment (Istadi et al., 2020a). The SRFCC catalyst, which was enhanced its active sites by the acid treatment, has a similar property as a zeolite from the acid site point of view (Istadi et al., 2020a). However, the Brønsted/Lewis acid sites in this enhanced SRFCC catalyst shows promising result in generating acid sites of the SRFCC catalysts, both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, by acid treatment as reported elsewhere (Istadi et al., 2020a). In addition to catalyst characterization, the physicochemical properties of the acid-treated SRFCC catalysts are provided in Table 2 . From the table, the acid treatment leads to the formation of high surface area catalysts, increases the catalysts acid sites, and enhances the Brønsted to Lewis acid sites ratio. However, the acid treatment decreases the catalysts pore size slightly. As shown in Table 2, the surface area of the SRFCC catalyst increases after acid treatment due to the metal leaching by the acids, which can lead to the formation of the voids in the SRFCC catalyst affecting high pore volume formation (Istadi et al., 2020a). Therefore, the surface area of the SRFCC catalysts increases after acid treatment. However, after the sulfuric acid treatment, the surface area of the SRFCC catalyst decreases. This decrease is due to the pore blocking by Al2(SO4)3 formed during the acid treatment. Ng et al. (2007) reported that the sulfuric acid in the sulfation of AlMCM-41 would react with SiOH and AlOH, leading to the migration of Al atom to extra-framework to produce Al2(SO4)3. The sorption-isotherm curves of the SRFCC catalysts are provided in Fig. 2 . Concerning the formation of the acid sites on the SRFCC catalysts after acid treatment, it is shown in Table 2 that the acid treatment can increase the BA/LA ratio. However, it is significantly found that SRFCC-CT and SRFCC-ST render in different BA/LA ratios. The BA/LA ratio of the SRFCC-ST catalyst is higher than the SRFCC-CT catalyst. It confirms that the sulfuric acid treatment leads to the formation of the Brønsted acid site rather than the Lewis acid site on the catalysts due to the formation of sulfated groups (HOSO3−) (Istadi et al., 2020a). Ng et al. (2007) also reported that the sulfation of AlMCM-41 using sulfuric acid could lead to the formation of the Brønsted acid site due to the sulfated group formation."
7,Effect of process parameters,"3.2 Effect of process parameters 3.2.1 Effect of catalysts type In the hydrocracking process, the catalyst is evaluated through its ability to convert the fatty acids-containing (triglyceride) feedstocks into shorter carbon ranges hydrocarbons. The acid-treated SRFCC catalysts were evaluated for catalytic performance in palm oil hydrocracking over the continuous fixed-bed reactor. The catalytic hydrocracking process was conducted at a temperature of 450 °C, WHSV of 0.365 min−1, and hydrogen flow rate of 0.3 NL/min. The catalysts performance results are briefly presented in Table 3 . The highest palm oil conversion was achieved using the SRFCC-NT (non-treatment) catalyst, while the lowest palm oil conversion was obtained using the SRFCC-ST (treated by sulfuric acid) catalyst; however, the difference of both conversions is not significant. This phenomenon confirms that the total acidity of catalysts is not significantly affected the conversion of palm oil through this hydrocracking process. However, the type of acid sites affects the hydrocracking process. Based on Tables 2 and 3, the lowest palm oil conversion is obtained by the SRFCC-ST catalyst, which has the highest Brønsted acid site amount with the highest Brønsted to Lewis acid ratio. In line with this finding, the lower hydrocarbon selectivity is in opposite trend with the Brønsted acid site amount. These phenomena are caused by the reaction mechanism that occurred over acid catalysts, where the initiation process of hydrocracking reaction is the formation of carbocations through the hydride abstraction by metal-active sites or Lewis acid sites and protonation by Brønsted acid sites which is similar to the non-hydrocracking reaction (Hengsawad et al., 2018; Vogt et al., 2015; Weitkamp, 2012). With respect to the protonation by Brønsted acid sites, the formation of carbocations takes place through the protonation of alkane (saturated hydrocarbons) and alkene (unsaturated hydrocarbons). However, the protonation of saturated hydrocarbons by Brønsted acid sites is slower than the protonation of unsaturated hydrocarbons (Hengsawad et al., 2018; Weitkamp, 2012). Therefore, the low activity in hydrocracking of palm oil over the SRFCC-ST catalyst is due to the slow protonation of the triglyceride of palm oil (Table 1). This finding is in accordance with the previous study as reported by Kazakov et al. (2019). They reported that the lower concentration of strong Brønsted acid sites resulted in the higher catalysts activity in hexadecane hydrocracking. Moreover, the low hydrocracking activity of the SRFCC-ST (sulfuric acid treatment) catalyst may be due to the low surface area and the slightly small pore size of the catalyst, which plays an important role in the mass transfer process of reactant molecules (Istadi et al., 2020a; Kazakov et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2017). Concerning the SRFCC-NT activity, it can be seen that the SRFCC-NT catalyst still has high activity in converting palm oil to biofuels through hydrocracking. It is due to the high amount of Lewis acid sites. As shown in Table 2, the lowest BA/LA ratio belongs to the SRFCC-NT catalyst. It means that the Lewis acid site is dominant on the SRFCC-NT catalyst. In addition, it still has a high surface area that has benefits in reducing the mass transfer limitation (Istadi et al., 2020a; Kazakov et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2017). Therefore, the SRFCC-NT catalyst still has a high activity to convert palm oil to biofuels. Based on Table 3, it can be seen that the hydrocarbons and the oxygenated compounds in the liquid fuel products are strictly affected by both total acidity and acid site type on the catalysts. The SRFCC-MT catalyst shows high activity in the deoxygenation process caused by the high amount of Lewis acid site, while the Brønsted acid site has lower activity in the deoxygenation process, as also exhibited in the SRFCC-ST catalyst. As reported by many researchers, the Lewis acid site has higher activity in the deoxygenation process since it can promote the decarbonylation and/or decarboxylation reaction (Hewer et al., 2018; Istadi et al., 2020a; Rogers and Zheng, 2016). Besides, it can promote carbon-coke formation (Istadi et al., 2020a). The carbon ranges of gasoline, kerosene, and diesel of the liquid fuel product distribution are presented in Fig. 3 . The liquid fuel products are dominated by kerosene and diesel ranges rather than gasoline ranges. The highest gasoline and kerosene ranges product are exhibited by the SRFCC-NT (non-treatment) catalyst, while the lowest gasoline and kerosene ranges are showed by the SRFCC-MT (mixed citric-sulfuric acids) catalyst. However, the diesel range (higher hydrocarbons range) has an opposite trend. According to Table 2, the highest selectivity to the selected product of gasoline and kerosene (lower hydrocarbons ranges) showed by the SRFCC-NT catalyst is caused by higher catalyst pore size. The higher catalyst pore size leads to the high catalyst activity towards hydrocracking to lower hydrocarbons ranges because of the high accessibility of the active sites, which in turn increasing the diffusion effect of the mass transfer of reactant molecules. As Kazakov et al. (2019) reported, the high pore size catalyst provides a beneficial effect for the accessibility of the active sites and the diffusion of the reactants. 3.2.2 Effect of hydrogen flow rate The effect of hydrogen flow rate on the hydrocracking process is crucial to study hydrogen consumption during palm oil cracking. The hydrocracking process was carried out at a temperature of 450 °C using the SRFCC-MT catalyst with a varying hydrogen flow rate of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 NL/min. As shown in Fig. 4 , the hydrogen flow rate does not significantly affect the palm oil conversion, while the yield of OLP is markedly affected by the hydrogen flow rate. On the other hand, the yield of gas and coke decreases with increasing the hydrogen flow rate. The decreasing coke formation with the increase in hydrogen flow rate confirms that the presence of hydrogen in the cracking reaction leads to the de-coking process. It is true since the H• radicals formed were reported as de-coking agents (Shi et al., 2019). The de-coking process takes place through the hydrogenation of coke by H radicals. The yield of OLP increases with the increase in hydrogen flow rate (Fig. 4), where the main components of OLP products are hydrocarbons compound and the minor component are oxygenated compounds (Table 4 ). It confirms that the introduction of hydrogen leads to the enhanced hydrocarbons formation rather than oxygenated compounds. According to Table 4, the presence of hydrogen acts as a deoxygenation agent since the oxygenated compounds are the minor compounds in the OLP. This result is in accordance with the similar previous studies, in which they suggested that the presence of hydrogen gas promotes the deoxygenation reaction through the hydrogenation process (Huber et al., 2007; Tanneru and Steele, 2015; Zhao et al., 2015). The interesting thing about the hydrodeoxygenation process is the double bond cleavage, which produces saturated hydrocarbons compounds. Based on GC–MS analysis, the saturated hydrocarbons are included as alkane group, while the unsaturated hydrocarbons containing a double bond, CC, are included as alkene group. As presented in Table 4, the alkanes compounds (saturated hydrocarbon compounds) are higher than alkenes compounds (unsaturated hydrocarbon compounds) in the OLP product. It confirms that the hydrogenation of double bonds results in saturated compounds (Zhao et al., 2015). The alkenes compounds are formed through the decarbonylation process of palm oil fatty acids. Istadi et al. (2020a) reported that the decarbonylation of palm oil fatty acids would produce alkenes molecules. Furthermore, the formed alkenes molecules are hydrogenated producing saturated hydrocarbons compounds. As shown in Table 4, hydrocarbons compounds increase with the increasing hydrogen flow rates up to 0.3 NL/min and then decrease at further higher hydrogen flow rates. The higher hydrogen flow rates lead to the shorter the contacting time between hydrogen molecules to the reactants. As the contacting time is short, the possibility of the collision process between hydrogen and other molecules is lower. Therefore, the possibility of the hydrogenation reaction is lower, resulting in low hydrocarbons production and low saturated compounds production. This phenomenon is also proved with the lower production of short-chain hydrocarbons molecules, as shown in Table 4. The gasoline range compounds decrease with the increasing hydrogen flow rate. 3.2.3 Effect of cracking reactor temperature In a chemical reaction, the synergy between reactor temperature and the acidic catalyst role is an important parameter due to the limitation of thermodynamic equilibrium of the reaction system, in which the temperature has an important role in supporting activation of the catalysts active site during the reaction (Wako et al., 2018). The effect of reactor temperature (450, 500, and 550 °C) on the hydrocracking reaction of the palm oil triglyceride using SRFCC-MT catalyst is presented in Fig. 5 . From the figure, the palm oil conversion is not significantly affected by the reactor temperature ranges (450–550 °C). However, the yield of OLP increases at the temperature range of 450 to 500 °C, but then decreases at a further increase in reactor temperature, with increasing the yield of gas product. The yield of gas decreases at the temperature of 450 °C to 500 °C and then increases at a further increase in reactor temperature. These confirm that the catalyst activity increases at a temperature range of 450 to 500 °C and then decreases at a further increase in reactor temperature. The increasing yield of OLP is due to the high catalyst activity; hence, the catalysts can direct the occurrence of hydrocracking reaction to the OLP formation rather than gas formation. However, a further increase in reactor temperature leads to catalyst deactivation, which may be due to sintering the catalyst (Bartholomew, 2001). The sintering process is more possible since the coke formation is not significantly increasing at 550 °C. Another possibility of the decreasing yield of OLP at higher temperatures is due to the further cracking of the OLP to lighter gaseous products (Cheng et al., 2014; Dujjanutat and Kaewkannetra, 2020). This finding is in accordance with some previous reported studies (Dujjanutat and Kaewkannetra, 2020; Yang et al., 2017). Dujjanutat and Kaewkannetra (2020) reported that the yield of biofuel in the hydrocracking of refined bleached deodorized palm/palm kernel oils increases under temperature from 470 °C to 490 °C, then the yield was decreased with higher temperature. From Table 5 , the hydrocarbons compound in the OLP increases with the increasing reactor temperature, while the oxygenated compounds decrease, which is due to the oxygen removal (deoxygenation) at high reactor temperature. The same finding was reported by Bezergianni and co-authors (Bezergianni et al., 2009; Bezergianni and Kalogianni, 2009) that the oxygen content in the hydrocracking of liquid product of vegetable oils (i.e., used cooking oil and vacuum gas oil-vegetable oil mixtures) decreases with the increase in reactor temperature. On the other hand, the ratio of alkane (saturated hydrocarbon) to alkene (unsaturated hydrocarbon) increases at reactor temperature from 450 to 500 °C and then decreases at further increasing the reactor temperature. This indicates that the hydrogenation reaction favorably occurs at reactor temperature around 500 °C. This is true since the catalyst is more active at a temperature around 500 °C, and it may deactivate at a higher temperature because of the sintering process. If the catalyst becomes more active due to higher reactor temperature, the hydrogenation or double bond cleavage occurs more effectively. The product selectivity of gasoline, kerosene, and diesel range hydrocarbons (Table 5) in the OLP products seems to increase with reactor temperatures and decreases with further increasing reactor temperature, where the hydrocarbons products selectivity reaches the highest value at a temperature of 500 °C. The lowest value of gasoline range selectivity is obtained at a reactor temperature of 450 °C, while the lowest value of kerosene and diesel ranges selectivity is obtained at a reactor temperature of 550 °C. These facts show that at low reactor temperature, the hydrocracking reaction moves forward to the formation of long-chain hydrocarbons, while at high reactor temperature, the hydrocracking reaction leads to the formation of short-chain hydrocarbons. This is true since the further cracking of the long-chain hydrocarbons to short-chain hydrocarbons or even lighter gaseous products occurs at high reactor temperature (Cheng et al., 2014; Dujjanutat and Kaewkannetra, 2020)."
8,Proposed reaction mechanism,"3.3 Proposed reaction mechanism Based on the GC–MS analysis, the molecules produced are hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds. The oxygenated compounds contain fatty acids and alcohols. This fact confirms that the reaction mechanism of palm oil hydrocracking includes hydrogenation of triglyceride to fatty acid, hydrogenation of fatty acid to aldehyde and alcohol, and deoxygenation of fatty acid through decarbonylation, decarboxylation, and hydrodeoxygenation. The fatty acid is formed from the triglyceride molecule through the hydrogenolytic CO cleavage, producing propane gas as the by-product (Schreiber et al., 2016). Furthermore, the fatty acid formed is converted through deoxygenation and hydrogenation. The breakdown of triglyceride can be conducted through β–elimination, hydrolysis, γ–hydrogen transfer, and direct deoxygenation (Rogers and Zheng, 2016). These mechanisms produce glycerol compounds as by-products. However, the glycerol compounds are not detected in the liquid products. Therefore, the possible mechanism that occurred is hydrogenolytic CO cleavage in a triglyceride molecule. Further hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds formation from fatty acid molecules occur through decarboxylation, decarbonylation, and hydrogenation. The proposed reaction mechanism is depicted in Scheme 1 . The hydrocarbons molecules can be formed directly from fatty acid through decarboxylation by releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) molecule (Scheme 1(A)) and decarbonylation by releasing carbon monoxide (CO) and water (H2O) molecules (Scheme 1(B)). These reactions mostly take place on the Lewis acid site (Istadi et al., 2020a). Alkane molecule (saturated hydrocarbon) is formed through decarboxylation, while alkene molecule (unsaturated hydrocarbon) is formed through decarbonylation. Both reactions form hydrocarbon with one carbon shorter than the fatty acid reacted. Therefore, since palm oil mostly contains C16-fatty acid (hexadecanoic acid) and C18-fatty acid (oleic acid), the hydrocarbons formed are C15 and C17. The hydrocarbons under C15 are formed through the cracking reaction. Concerning the formation of oxygenated compounds formed by Brønsted acid site-rich catalysts, it is suggested that the reactions take place on the Brønsted acid site. As mentioned, the most oxygenated compound formed is alcohol. It is suggested that the alcohol molecules are formed through the fatty acid hydrogenation to aldehyde and then converted to alcohol through further aldehyde hydrogenation. The proposed mechanism is presented in Scheme 1(C). Prior to the hydrogenation reaction, the hydrogen gas is activated by the Lewis acid site (Li et al., 2016)."
9,Conclusion,"The total acidity of catalysts does not significantly affect the conversion of palm oil through the hydrocracking process, while the acid site type of the catalysts has a significant role. The higher the Brønsted acid site, the lower the palm oil conversion and the lower deoxygenation activity. Otherwise, the Lewis acid site has a significant role in the deoxygenation reaction mechanism. The introduction of hydrogen gas in the reaction system has a significant role in deoxygenation, double bond cleavage, and de-coking process mechanisms. Besides, the hydrocarbons compounds increase with the reactor temperature, in which the short-chain hydrocarbons compounds formed."
