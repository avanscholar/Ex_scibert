0,Introduction,"Exploitation of renewable energy sources for the production of fuels and fine chemicals has become one the advantageous protocol in various chemical reactions (Parrino et al., 2018; Vu et al., 2019). Solar mediated chemical transformations could be considered as the most efficient route, which may originate by the utilization of an inexhaustible source of renewable energy (You et al., 2021; Lhermitte and Sivula, 2019). Photocatalytic water splitting into H2 fuel is an ideal example showing solar light driven chemical reaction, rendering the process highly sustainable and promising (Wang et al., 2009; Iqbal et al., 2018). Over the decades, plenty of efforts have been bestowed to realize the photocatalytic water splitting process (Abouelela et al., 2021; Wang and Domen, 2020). The possible way to commence the water splitting effectively, require the generation of electrons for water reduction (i.e. H2 evolution) and holes (h + ) for the water oxidation (i.e. O2 evolution) over the surface of semiconductor (Takanabe and Domen, 2011; Chen et al., 2017). However, photocatalysis of water splitting is usually rather inadequate, retarding the simultaneous H2 evolution and water oxidation to O2 due high water-oxidation overpotential, and sluggish water-oxidation kinetics to the complex multistep reaction involving four electrons (Fajrina and Tahir, 2019). To efficiently restrain the oxidation process, various hole-scavengers (sacrificial reagents) are employed, such as alcohols (Rather et al., 2018), amines (Jiang et al., 2021), carboxylic acids (Yasuda et al., 2018), and saccharides (Silva et al., 2015), to boost up the H2 generation. Although this strategy may accelerate the H2 production but requires a copious number of sacrificial reagents which derail the chemical economy drastically and generate more waste, against the energy-efficient and environmentally friendly demands. Hence, it is worthwhile to utilize the h + for transformation of organic substrate into valuable products, superseding the conventional hole-scavengers for the integrated production of a H2 and value-added organic chemicals or derivatives (Kuehnel and Reisner, 2018; Battula et al., 2019). Rendering to this photo-redox process, recently photocatalytic acceptorless dehydrogenation (PAD) pathway has gained significant laurels to promote the oxidation reactions by releasing molecular H2 as a fuel (Fuse et al., 2020). Furthermore, PAD is considered to be a feasible pathway to foster the H2 economy by using potential organic motifs as H2 energy carriers, depriving the use of external additives (sacrificial agents). In this direction, researchers have remarkably shown their efforts to encash the organic substrate oxidation coupled with H2 production (Huang et al., 2020). Alcohols have been widely utilized for the PAD reactions. Chao et al. (2019) and Weng et al. (2016) have potentially shown the concurrent production of value-added 1,1-diethoxyethane (DEE) and H2 via photocatalytic ethanol dehydrogenationâ€“acetalization by utilizing the non-precious CdS/Ni-MoS2 and Pd-TiO2 nanosheets. Furthermore, reports on photocatalytic dehydrogenation of methanol has also witnessed the production of valuable products such as formaldehyde (HCHO) (Huang et al., 2019) and 1,1-dimethoxymethane (DMM) (Chao et al., 2018) over non-precious Ni/CdS and CdS/Ni2P photocatalysts, respectively. Screening of various (aromatic)amine substrates for PAD reaction register divergent value-added chemicals via decoupling of H2. Azo (-N=N-) (Sahoo et al., 2018) and imines (-C=N-) (Klarner et al., 2020) are found to be major photo-oxidized value-added products of (aromatic)amines. However, current study focuses mainly on aromatic imines production via dehydrogenation of aromatic amines. Chemistry of oxidized C-N based coupled products has shown great potential towards sustainable process (Li et al., 2019a). Imines and their derivatives are privileged structural motifs, exhibiting myriad of applications in dyes (Meguellati et al., 2009), pharmaceuticals (Wakchaure et al., 2015), agrochemicals (Wu et al., 2019), and fine chemicals (Guo et al., 2016) synthesis. Extensive efforts have been put forward for the synthesis of imines via photocatalytic one pot oxidative coupling route of amines in presence of metal oxides (Furukawa et al., 2011), dye sensitized (Li et al., 2021), chalcogenides (Raza et al., 2016), composites (Juntrapirom et al., 2021), MOFs (Zhao et al., 2020), organic polymeric catalysts (Kumar et al., 2021; Battula et al., 2018), and metal-ligand complexes (Yang et al., 2019) utilizing oxygen (O2) as a terminal oxidant. However, aforementioned aerobic oxidative synthesis of imines via photocatalytic route in presence of various catalysts suffers from certain limitations which are as follows: 1) an aerobic oxidative coupling of amines to imines in presence of volatile organic solvents is quite a difficult task. 2) electron-hole pair is only utilized for a single oxidation process (amines oxidation). Therefore, utilization of electron-hole pairs in such a manner to promote separate processes like reduction (H2 generation) and oxidation (amines oxidation) simultaneously is an urgent requirement for most sustainable processes. This could only be possible in anaerobic environment. Conversely, oxidation of amines to imines under anaerobic environment has shown major advancement to endow the production of H2 synergistically. In one such report very recently, Huang et al. (2020) demonstrated a facile photo dehydrogenative coupling of amines to imines with coincident liberation of molecular H2 over Ni/CdS semiconductor, remarking a substantial selectivity of imines (i.e. >99%). In addition, Balayeva et al. (2020) has reported an acceptorless dehydrogenation of N-heterocyclic amines under visible light irradiation by noble Rh deposited TiO2 photocatalyst to substantiate the aromaticity in the N-heterocyclic compounds. Apparently, this study highlighted the inclusion of -C=N- bonds in aromatic N-heterocyclic compounds via dehydrogenation. Nevertheless, the optimum performance of the above mentioned photocatalysts, their efficacy could be minimised due to use of noble Rh metal, wide band gap (3.2 eV) TiO2 photocatalyst and photo corrosion of CdS photocatalysts under prolonged light irradiation. The utilization of organic polymeric carbon nitride could be an obvious choice for amines valorization into corresponding imines (Bajada et al., 2020)for the following reasons: 1) visible light absorption (band gap 2.7 eV), 2) suitable CB and VB for photo redox reactions, 3) excellent chemical and photo tolerant ability and 4) heterogeneous metal-free organic semiconductor. In addition, the introduction of porosity and high surface area can accelerate the photocatalytic performance of the carbon nitrides to a large extent on account of profound exposed surface active sites (Kailasam et al., 2011). In particular, the photogenerated charge carriers (e - -h + ) undergo feasible diffusion over substrate to minimize the e - -h + recombination rate, leading to enhanced photocatalytic activity in mesoporous carbon nitrides (Iqbal et al., 2020). It is pertinent to highlight that so far, several reports which consisted of amines to imines transformation in presence of carbon nitride based photocatalytic system without the generation of H2 are mentioned in Table S1. However, these all invariably employed oxidative coupling of amines into imines using molecular oxygen (O2) as an oxidant. To the best of our knowledge, no reports have significantly shown the PAD of aromatic amines to realize the production of imines by liberating H2 over mesoporous carbon nitride photocatalyst under a non-oxygen environment. Therefore, herein, in this study we reported a visible light mediated acceptorless dehydrogenation of aromatic amines to imines with concurrent generation of molecular H2 over mesoporous carbon nitride (SGCN) photocatalyst by employing non-noble metal (Ni) under non-aqueous solvent. Owing to the integrating effect between the two transformations, this work provides an efficient route for generation of H2 and aromatic amines conversion with >99% selectivity of imines under visible light irradiation via acceptorless dehydrogenative pathway. The presence of non-precious Ni metal over SGCN significantly not only promoted the efficient charge separation but also supported the generation of H2, showing a co-operative effect of Ni. Furthermore, controlled scavenger studies have proven that the amine substrate acted as an efficient H2 carrier molecule. Overall, the dual photocatalyzed redox reaction i.e., H2 production and imines synthesis over Ni-decorated mesoporous carbon nitride via PAD pathway has governed the new insights towards sustainability and shown great propensity for diverse photo-redox reactions over mesoporous carbon nitride based photocatalytic systems."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Cyanamide (CA), tetraethoxy orthosilicate (TEOS), ammonium hydrogen difluoride (NH4HF2), and Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, India. HCl (35%, Fisher Scientific) and ethanol (99.99%, analytical grade (Changshu Hongsheng Fine Chemicals) was purchased and used for the synthesis. Furfuryl amine, 4-chloro benzyl amine, 4-fluro benzyl amine, 4-methoxy benzyl amine, 4-methyl benzyl amine, 2-thiophenemethylamine, 4-nitro benzyl amine and benzyl amine were purchased from TCI chemicals, India. All the chemicals were used without further purification."
3,Synthesis procedure of SGCN,"2.2 Synthesis procedure of SGCN The synthesis procedure of mesoporous carbon nitride (SGCN) was adapted according to the previous literature (Kailasam et al., 2011). Firstly, CA and TEOS were taken in 6:1 M ratio and dissolved in 0.01 M aqueous HCl (4 g) and ethanol (4 g). The pH of the resultant mixture was maintained to 2 by adding HCl dropwise. After that the solution mixture was stirred for 30 min and the solvent was evaporated by rotary evaporation and subsequently dried at 80 Â°C for 24 h. The obtained solid was further calculated at 550 Â°C under inert atmosphere with a ramping rate of 5 Â°C/min for 4 h to get the mesoporous carbon nitride-silica composite. The composite was washed with 4 M ammonium bifluoride (NH4HF2) solution for 48 h to remove the silica followed by washing with water and ethanol several times to obtain pure mesoporous carbon nitride (SGCN). The obtained SGCN was dried in the oven overnight at 120 Â°C."
4,Deposition of Ni on SGCN,"2.3 Deposition of Ni on SGCN Prior to the reaction, nickel (Ni) co-catalyst was deposited on the surface of SGCN by a chemical reduction method. Briefly, a certain amount of synthesized SGCN was taken in a 50 mL of distilled water containing a required amount of NiCl2.6H2O. The amount of NiCl2.6H2O was taken in such a manner to vary the Ni wt. % (1, 2 and 5 wt %) over SGCN. The solution was stirred and degassed in N2 for 20 min. Then a certain amount of NaBH4 solution in 2 mL of water was added dropwise to the reaction mixture under N2 atmosphere and further left the reaction mixture for 1 h under stirring condition. After that the solid residue was collected by centrifugation and washed with copious amounts of water-ethanol mixture. The Ni deposited SGCN was dried at 80 Â°C overnight. The prepared samples were labelled as 1 wt % Ni@SGCN, 2 wt % Ni@SGCN and 5 wt % Ni@SGCN. The Ni content was estimated by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis as shown in Table S2."
5,Photocatalytic activity,"2.4 Photocatalytic activity In order to ascribe the photocatalytic activity of Ni@SGCN, 5 mL ACN (HPLC grade) and 0.11 mmol furfuryl amine were taken as a model substrate into the round bottom flask containing certain amount of Ni@SGCN catalyst. Then the round bottom flask was sealed and purged with N2 for 20 min to remove any dissolved O2. Thereafter, the subsequent reaction mixture was illuminated by a 400 W Xenon lamp with 420 nm cut off filter for a certain period of time with continuous stirring. The evolution of gaseous H2 was quantified by a gas chromatography (GC 9790 Instruments) equipped with a thermal conductive detector (TCD) and argon (Ar) as a carrier gas. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of liquid mixture was estimated by the Shimadzu Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS). Notably, earlier experiments demonstrated that among all the Ni deposited SGCN, 2 wt% Ni@SGCN exhibited an excellent photocatalytic activity as shown in Table S3. The photocatalytic activity of 2 wt% Ni@SGCN was also checked for varied aromatic amines conversion into respective imines integrated with H2 production. Furthermore, after the reaction the catalyst was separated, washed thoroughly with ethanol-water mixture, dried in an oven at 80 Â°C and further utilized for subsequent recycling experiments."
6,Analytical techniques,"2.5 Analytical techniques The diffraction pattern of the samples was determined by powder XRD using Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer equipped with a scintillation counter detector, with Cu-KÎ± radiation (Î» = 0.15418 nm) source operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. The Diffuse reflectance UVâ€“Visible (DRUVâ€“Vis) spectra was recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer. BET surface area and pore volume were estimated by the Braunerâ€“Emmettâ€“Teller (BET) and Barrettâ€“Joynerâ€“Halenda (BJH) method on Autosorb iQ2 instrument (Quantachrome). The morphology of the samples was analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL). The elemental composition of the samples was estimated by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). However, the chemical states of the elements were corroborated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, the conversion of the aromatic amine and selectivity of the imines were estimated by Shimadzu Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS). The quantification of gaseous H2 was performed by Shimadzu Gas Chromatography (GC 9790 Instruments) equipped with a thermal conductive detector (TCD) and argon (Ar) as a carrier gas."
7,Results and discussions,"XRD patterns displayed an intense peak at 27.3Â° arising from (002) planes, confirming the diffraction peak due to the graphite-like planes presence in SGCN (Fig. S1, ESI). However, after Ni deposition over the surface of SGCN, no vivid diffraction peaks were observed which could resemble the presence of Ni or it's corresponding species in the XRD pattern. This could manifest the lower loading of Ni-species or low crystallinity of Ni-species. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) and elemental mapping analysis (Figs. S2a and 2b, ESI) further confirmed the even distribution of Ni with other elements such as C, N, and O in the prepared 2 wt% Ni@SGCN sample. However, the percentage of the Ni in different samples was estimated by EDX analysis as mentioned in Table S2. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed to examine the surface morphology of the 2 wt% Ni@SGCN. The Ni over the mesoporous surface of SGCN could be observed in agglomerated form of Ni species, showing the average size of the particles ca. 22.5 nm (Fig. S2c, ESI). A typical high resolution TEM (HRTEM) is displayed in Fig. S2d, ESI. The existence of Ni over the layered structural motif of SGCN with evidence of porosity could be manifested by lattice distance which was found to be 0.21 nm, matching well with lattice distances of (111) plane of a metallic Ni (Jia et al., 2020). The DRUV-Vis spectra of SGCN and Ni deposited SGCN is shown in Fig. S3a, ESI. Besides the onset absorption of SGCN at 450 nm which could be assigned to the electronic transition from N2p to C2p orbitals, the extended absorption shoulder band from 450 to 600 nm indicated the presence of carbon impurities in SGCN which might be arisen from the residual ethanol during the thermal condensation process (Zhang et al., 2011). Furthermore, a minute change in the absorbance of SGCN has been observed after the Ni deposition, showing minimal increment in the absorption of visible light towards the red region. However, the band gap of SGCN and 2 wt % Ni@SGCN samples were estimated by the Tauc plot as 2.63 eV and 2.57 eV (inset Fig. S3a, ESI). Moreover, insights towards efficient charge carrier separation (e - , h + ) in 2 wt % Ni@SGCN was obtained by photoluminescence (PL) analysis (Fig. S3 b, ESI). The fluorescence intensity of SGCN after Ni deposition decreased, indicating improved charge separation in SGCN after the Ni deposition (Li et al., 2019b). In addition to the optical efficiency, transient photocurrent study of 2 wt % Ni@SGCN was even further conducted to validate the efficient charge separation (e - , h + ) of photogenerated charge carriers. The photocurrent measurements of SGCN and 2 wt % Ni@SGCN were obtained during five light turn-off cycles (Fig. S3 c, ESI). Apparently, the photocurrent response density of 2 wt % Ni@SGCN was found to be higher than that of SGCN, manifesting that the existence of Ni species over mesoporous surface of SGCN accomplish an improved charge separation. N2 adsorption desorption isotherm of SGCN (Fig. 1 ) discloses the type-IV isotherm, which is typical for mesoporous materials. The measured specific surface area (SSA) for SGCN was 186 m2/g and after Ni deposition the SSA reduced to 150 m2/g (Table S4). However, the corresponding pore volume and pore radius of the SGCN with and without Ni was estimated via BJH (Barrettâ€“Joynerâ€“Halenda) method as shown in Table S4. As expected, after the Ni deposition the pore volume and pore radius of the SGCN underwent a consequential decrease when compared to bare SGCN, considering the deposition of Ni on the surface and inside the pores of the SGCN, leading to partial pore blockage. To confirm the chemical composition and precise existence of metallic Ni (0) over the mesoporous surface of SGCN, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further undertaken in the current study. Full survey scan of the samples SGCN and 2 wt % Ni@SGCN manifested the chemical composition of C, N, O and Ni, as shown in Fig. 2 a. However, the high-resolution spectra of Ni 2p demonstrated two sets of peaks corresponding to metallic Ni (0) and Ni (II). Peaks at 851.7 and 869.4 eV attributed to metallic Ni (0), and peaks at 857.2 and 875.3 eV were corroborated to Ni present in +2 state i.e., Ni (II) (Fig. 2b) (Han et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2018). Thus, the presence of Ni (II) could be assigned as an oxidized Ni species formed during sample preparation. It is pertinent to mention that the O1s peak in the 2 wt% Ni@SGCN sample presumably defines the existence of amorphous oxides of Ni. To validate this even further, the O 1s spectra demonstrated a peak at 529.2 eV which is typically due to the presence of O-Ni, i.e., NiO (Fig. S4), matching similar with the previous reports (Weidler et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2012). Furthermore, the edge potentials of conduction band (ECBM) and valence band (EVBM) of the photocatalysts are the critical parameters to substantiate the charge transportation and redox photocatalysis. The edge potential of the valence band could be calculated by VB XPS analysis and the estimated EVBM values of SGCN and 2 wt %Ni SGCN were found to be +1.81 eV and +1.67 eV, respectively (Fig. 2c). Based on the EVBM values and obtained band gaps of the SGCN (Eg = 2.63 eV) and 2 wt % Ni@SGCN (Eg = 2.57 eV) from Tauc plot (Fig. S3 a, inset), ECBM of SGCN and 2 wt % Ni@SGCN were calculated by using EVBM = ECBM + Eg equation. The estimated ECBM values of SGCN and 2 wt % Ni@SGCN were found to be âˆ’0.82eV and âˆ’0.9 eV, respectively. Moreover, the photocatalytic performance could conceptually be hypothesized from the position of EVBM and ECBM by illustrating band energy diagrams. On this account, the band energy diagram of SGCN and 2 wt % Ni@SGCN is shown in Fig. 2d."
8,Photocatalytic activity,"3.1 Photocatalytic activity Initially, the photocatalytic activity of the as-synthesized different Ni@SGCN photocatalysts such as 1 wt % Ni@SGCN, 2 wt% Ni@SGCN and 5 wt% Ni@SGCN was scrutinized for visible light driven anaerobic furfuryl amine valorization (taken as a model substrate) into corresponding imine integrated with H2 production under 400 W Xenon lamp with 420 nm cut off filter (Table 1 ). Moreover, among all photocatalysts, 2 wt% Ni@SGCN was found to be most efficient photocatalyst for the furfuryl amine valorization and even further tested at various reaction conditions which are summarized in Table 1. The photocatalytic activity of 2 wt% Ni@SGCN was examined for 6 h in an inert (N2) atmosphere under visible light irradiation. The evolved H2 rate 5.03 Î¼mol/h/g along with 12.5% conversion of furfuryl amine with >99% selectivity of imines was estimated (Table 1, entry 2). It was observed that no conversion took place in absence of both light and 2 wt% Ni@SGCN catalyst (Table 1, entry 4 and 5) conditions. The presence of co-catalyst (Ni) boosts up the H2 evolution due to the better charge separation, therefore, no generation of H2 and negligible furfuryl amine conversion were observed in absence of Ni co-catalysts over SGCN surface (Table 1, entry 6). Inevitably exploitation of the natural sunlight is an indispensable task to supersede the other source of simulated light for the photocatalytic applications. Therefore, we scrutinized the feasibility of the synthesized 2 wt % Ni@SGCN catalyst for anaerobic coupling of furfuryl amine to corresponding imine coupled with H2 generation under natural sunlight (Fig. 3 ). After 6 h, H2 evolution rate was found to be 4.6 Î¼mol/h/g and conversion of furfuryl amine was about 13% with >99% selectivity of corresponding imine (Table 1, entry 7). These initial results on model compounds show a highly sustainable pathway not only for amine valorization but also for various biomass/organic transformations coupled with H2 generation. The correspondence relationship between the 2 wt% Ni@SGCN photocatalytic activity of furfuryl amine conversion and the incident wavelength of light demonstrated in line harmony with its optical absorption spectrum (Fig. 4 ). Furthermore, photocatalytic efficiency of H2 generation by using 2 wt% Ni@SGCN photocatalyst was measured in terms of apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) at 400 nm under similar reaction conditions. The incident photon intensity was measured using a Ray virtual radiation actinometer (Newport, Model: 91150 V). The AQE (%) was calculated from the following formula: A Q E ( % ) = 2 Ã— n o . o f e v o l v e d H 2 m o l e c u l e s n o . o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s Ã— 100 % The photocatalytic AQE (%) of the H2 production was estimated to be 1.1% (400 nm, 20 mg catalyst). To assess the significance of synthesized 2 wt% Ni@SGCN photocatalyst, its photocatalytic activity was explored even further for different aromatic substituted amines with and without heteroatoms under optimized reaction conditions using visible light irradiation (Table 2 , entry 1â€“8). It was observed that all the aromatic amine substrates containing either electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups were efficiently promoting the conversion of aromatic amines into corresponding imines with >99% selectivity coupled with H2 generation (Table 2, Entry 3â€“7). However, among the different substrates, 4-methoxy benzyl amine or electron-donating substituted benzyl amines manifested comparatively higher activity to the substrate having electron-withdrawing groups (Table 2, entry 5, 6 and 7). This corroborated an efficient generation of H2 along with imines synthesis. In case of 2-thiophenemethylamine the percentage of conversion and H2 evolution rate were found to be almost similar to furfuryl amine (Table 2, entry 1 and 8)."
9,Time dependent study,"3.2 Time dependent study To further understand the magnitude of anaerobic coupling of aromatic amines into corresponding imines along with H2 production using 2 wt % Ni@SGCN, experiments were performed for 6 h, 12 h, 18 h and 24 h under optimized conditions as mentioned in Table 1. Time study of furfuryl amine is shown in Fig. 5 . Experimental studies demonstrated an increase in the conversion of furfuryl amine along with H2 production with the reaction time from 6 h to 24 h. It should be noted that the selectivity to corresponding imines were maintained >99% even after 24 h. The GC-MS profiles of the liquid mixture after 24 h have been shown in Fig. S5, ESI."
10,Mechanistic study,"3.3 Mechanistic study A plausible mechanism for PAD of furfuryl amine to corresponding imine integrated with H2 production under anaerobic conditions is illustrated in Scheme 1 . In order to explore the exact pathway of furfuryl amine valorization, few control experiments were conducted as shown in Table 3 . The mechanism of H2 evolution in presence of electron donors is well known, thus by replacing furfuryl amine with TEOA could provide better understanding towards the hole scavenging behaviour or oxidation process. When TEOA was taken as hole scavenger, the H2 evolution rate was enhanced 4 folds to furfuryl amine (Table 3, entry 1 and 2) which can be explained by the stronger electron donating ability of TEOA than furfuryl amine. The reaction without hole scavenger (furfuryl amine) did not generate any H2 (Table 3, entry 3). As there was no water present in the reaction mixture, H2 was basically generated from the amine sources i.e., TEOA and furfuryl amine (Table 3, entry 1 and 2), manifesting the photoreforming of amines. In the case of sodium persulfate as electron scavenger, no H2 was detected (Table 3, entry 4), although 9% furfuryl amine conversion was observed. But as photogenerated electrons were consumed rapidly by sodium persulfate, they were hardly available for further reduction of protons (H+) liberated from furfuryl amine during oxidation reaction via h + . Therefore, we conclude that the H2 was only generated by reduction of H+ via photogenerated electrons in the conduction band of SGCN. From the above results we propose the following mechanistic pathway as shown in Scheme 1. The electrons got excited from the valence band (VB) of SGCN to its conduction band (CB) and leave corresponding h + at the VB under visible light irradiation. First the photogenerated h + initiated the oxidation process of the furfuryl amine via deprotonation with the generation of carbon centred cationic species (Huang et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2015) which immediate converted into furan-2-ylmethanimine and co-produced two protons (2H+) via proton transfer process. Furthermore, positively charged h + coordinated to furan-2-ylmethanimine thereby making furan-2-ylmethanimine more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by another molecule of furfuryl amine to generate aminal. Thereafter, the further oxidation of the aminal with the assistance of positively charged h + afforded the desired imine product by eliminating ammonia as by-product. However, the photogenerated electrons rapidly transfer to Ni co-catalyst from the conduction band of SGCN to reduce the protons into H2."
11,Stability study,"3.4 Stability study Furthermore, the stability of as-synthesized 2 wt% Ni@SGCN catalyst was performed by utilizing it further for recycling experiments. Five subsequent cycles were performed as shown in Fig. 6 , demonstrating only a mere decrease in the photocatalytic activity of the oxidation process i.e., coupling of furfuryl amine to corresponding imine. However, the H2 generation suffers a steady decay, which might be due to the competing reduction of Ni2+ to Ni (0) via photoinduced electrons during the recycling experiments [60]. The catalyst was washed by copious amounts of water and ethanol followed by vacuum drying at 80 Â°C before each cycle. To note that after five cycles, the catalyst was characterized again by XRD, TEM and BET analysis (Fig. S6, ESI). No significant changes were observed in the surface morphology and crystalline structure of the catalyst even after the 5th cycle (Fig. S6 a, ESI). However, reduction in the SSA and Ni content were explicitly observed as shown in Fig. S6 b, Table S4 ESI, which describes the slight decrease in the photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the retained surface morphology and evidence of Ni particles over the mesoporous surface of SGCN could further be supported by TEM analysis even after the 5th cycle (Fig. S6 c, ESI). Eventually, these recycling studies infer the good stability of the photocatalyst."
12,Conclusion,"In summary, we have successfully demonstrated the visible light mediated anaerobic coupling of aromatic amines to their corresponding imines integrated with H2 generation by utilizing non-noble Ni species deposited mesoporous carbon nitride (Ni@SGCN) for the first time. The Ni incorporated catalytic system boosts up the furfuryl amine conversion including various aromatic amines which synergistically promote the H2 generation via PAD strategy under visible light irradiation ( Î» > 420 nm). Among all, 2 wt% Ni@SGCN was found to be a good photocatalyst. In case of furfuryl amine, H2 generation rate was estimated 5.03 Î¼mol/h/g along with 12.5% conversion of furfuryl amine with >99% selectivity of corresponding imine in 6 h. Highest H2 production rate of 23.58 Î¼mol/h/g along with maximum 36% conversion in 6 h was observed when taking 4-methoxy benzyl amine as a substrate. In addition, under natural sunlight 2 wt% Ni@SGCN showed H2 generation rate of 4.6 Î¼mol/h/g and 13% conversion of furfuryl amine with >99% selectivity of imine in 6 h. The corresponding AQE (%) of the H2 production was estimated to be 1.1.% (400 nm, 20 mg catalyst). Moreover, the photoactivity of the catalyst was even further exploited up to five recycling experiments, endowing good stability of the photocatalyst (analysed by XRD, TEM and BET). However, the mechanistic route of the reaction under controlled experiments (substrate and scavenger studies) exemplified h + assisted furfuryl amine conversion (oxidation) to corresponding imine and protons (source of H2 fuel). Eventually, the concurrent production of H2 and aromatic amines oxidation is a highly preferable photo-redox process, advancing a brighter view point for sustainable chemistry and solar energy utilization in a synergistic manner via PAD strategy. Indeed, the current study consequently insights the PAD approach to offer a distinctive horizon for targeting the dual face photocatalysis for H2 production accompanied by organic oxidation to value-added commodities in a single pot."
