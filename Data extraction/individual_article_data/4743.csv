0,Introduction,"Organic compounds used in our present society have been produced from the basic key compounds mainly obtained from fossil fuels. Given the depletion of fossil resources in the future, the development of renewable resources should be an urgent issue for the continuous supply of platform chemicals [1]. Levulinic acid is one of the most promising building blocks, which is selected as the “Value added top 12 chemicals produced from biomass” by the US Department of Energy [2]. γ-Valerolactone (GVL) can be obtained by the hydrogenation of levulinic acid or its esters, and has attracted much attention as a very important platform chemical for wider applications, such as bio-polymers [3], solvents [4], fuels or fuel additives [5], and other chemical intermediates [6]. The production of GVL by the hydrogenation of levulinic acid and its esters have been reported using both homogeneous catalysts and heterogeneous catalysts. During the early stage of this field, heterogeneous noble metal catalysts, such as Ru [7], Pd [8], Pt [9], and Au [10], have been studied and showed moderate to excellent activities using hydrogen gas. However, as noble metal catalysts are not preferable for industrial applications from an economical viewpoint, studies of the non-noble metal catalysts have intensified in recent years. Such examples include Cu [11], Co [12], Ni [13], CuNi [14], CuNiCoB [15], NiMo [16], NiFe [17], NiSn [18], Ni-MoOX [19], FeZn [20], and Mo2C [21]. Hydrogen transfer reactions using alcohol as a hydrogen donor are another strategy for producing GVL from levulinic acid and its esters. The hydrogen transfer reaction does not use hydrogen gas that has the potential danger of explosion. Non-noble metal catalysts, such as Hf [22], Ni [23], NiCu [24], TiZr [25], SnO2 [26], zirconium phosphate [27], and ZrO2 [28] have been evaluated for this purpose. Although a significant number of studies have been published for the production of GVL from levulinic acid or its esters, many of them required moderate to high reaction temperatures (≈473 K). Relatively low temperatures for the hydrogen transfer reactions of levulinic acid have been reported using SnO2/SBA15 (GVL yield 81% at 383 K) [26] and Zr/β-zeolite (GVL yield 96% at 391 K) [29]. In the present study, to obtain a highly active catalyst to produce GVL, the combination of nickel and zirconium oxide was investigated using 2-propanol as the hydrogen donor."
1,Experimental,"Materials used in this study, product analyses, and the characterizations of the catalysts are mentioned in the supplementary information. The hydrogen transfer reactions of methyl levulinate and levulinic acid over the ZrO2 catalyst were carried out as follows. Zirconium oxide obtained from the Catalysis Society of Japan was calcined under oxygen (20 cm3/min) at 773 K for 3 h. The calcined catalysts used for the reaction were denoted as ZRO(2), ZRO(3), ZRO(4), and ZRO(5) prepared from JRC-ZRO-2 (254 m2/g, amorphous), JRC-ZRO-3 (94 m2/g, monoclinic), JRC-ZRO-4 (30 m2/g, monoclinic), and JRC-ZRO-5 (194 m2/g, amorphous), respectively. One gram of the substrate, 20 cm3 of 2-propanol and 1 g of the ZRO(x, x = 2–5) catalyst were placed in an autoclave equipped with a magnetically-coupled mechanical stirrer. The autoclave was sealed, purged with Ar ten times, then the hydrogen transfer reaction was run under the atmospheric pressure of Ar for 5 h or 20 h. A 20 wt% Ni/ZrO2 catalyst was prepared by the impregnation method. Zirconium oxide, obtained from the Catalysis Society of Japan (3.2 g), was immersed in an aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2 (4.0 g of Ni(NO3)2 • 6H2O in 30 cm3 of H2O) and stirred at 353 K for 2 h. The resulting solid was dried at 393 K for 1 h and at 373 K for 18 h under reduced pressure (6 kPa). The dried sample was calcined under O2 (20 cm3/min) at 773 K for 3 h, then under H2 (30 cm3/min) at 673 K for 1 h. The catalysts used for the reaction were denoted as Ni/ZRO(2), Ni/ZRO(3), Ni/ZRO(4), and Ni/ZrRO(5) prepared from JRC-ZRO-2, JRC-ZRO-3, JRC-ZRO-4, and JRC-ZRO-5, respectively. The hydrogen transfer reactions over Ni/ZRO(x, x = 2–5) were carried out using the same procedure as for the reaction over ZRO(x, x = 2–5)."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Characterization of the catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of the catalysts Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of ZRO(2), ZRO(3), ZRO(4), and ZRO(5). While the peaks of the monoclinic ZrO2 (JCPDS No. 00-037-1484)) were observed with ZRO(2), ZRO(3), ZRO(4), and ZRO(5), the small peaks of tetragonal ZrO2 (JCPDS No. 01-071-4810)) were observed with ZRO(2), ZRO(3), and ZRO(5). The amorphous JRC-ZRO-2 and JRC-ZRO-5 changed to the monoclinic phase (ZRO(2) and ZRO(5)) during the calcination process. The calcination at 773 K for 3 h decreased the BET surface areas of the samples to. 82 m2/g (ZRO(2)), 91 m2/g (ZRO(3)), 39 m2/g (ZRO(4)), and 63 m2/g (ZRO(5)). Especially, the decreases in the amorphous samples, i.e., JRC-ZRO-2 and JRC-ZRO-5, were significant. The low surface area of ZRO(4) would be due to the higher calcination at 873 K during the synthesis of JRC-ZRO-4 by the manufacturer. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of Ni/ZRO(2), Ni/ZRO(3), Ni/ZRO(4), and Ni/ZRO(5). In contrast to the results of Fig. 1, the amorphous JRC-ZRO-2 and JRC-ZRO-5 changed to the tetragonal phase of ZrO2. The monoclinic phases of JRC-ZRO-3 and JRC-ZRO-4 did not change. Impregnation of Ni on JRC-ZRO-2 and JRC-ZRO-5 resulted in the transformation of amorphous to tetragonal phases. The monoclinic phase of ZrO2 is transformed into a tetragonal one at about 1200 K [30], but a dopant such as rare-earth metal decreases the transformation temperature to 673 K [31]. The results shown in Fig. 2 would be explained by that the partial inclusion of Ni into the amorphous JRC-ZRO-2 and JRC-ZRO-5 resulted in the transformation to tetragonal phases during the calcination."
4,Catalytic transfer hydrogenation of methyl levulinate and levulinic acid,"3.2 Catalytic transfer hydrogenation of methyl levulinate and levulinic acid In the preliminary experiments, the typical reaction conditions used in this study were examined as to whether they were under kinetic control. The results are shown in Figs. S-1 and S-2. As the yield was almost proportional to the amount of catalyst for both ZRO(3) and Ni/ZRO(3), the kinetic control under the present conditions were confirmed. The catalytic transfer hydrogenations of methyl levulinate and levulinic acid were carried out at 393 K using the four types of zirconium oxides. The yields of the products are shown in Fig. 3 . For the hydrogenation of methyl levulinate, the 20-h reaction produced GVL as the main product, and small amounts of isopropyl levulinate and isopropyl 4-hydroxypentanoate were also obtained. Meanwhile, for the hydrogenation of levulinic acid, the activity of the transfer hydrogenation over ZrO2 was significantly lower than in the methyl levulinate case for the 20-h reaction, nevertheless ZRO(3) produced the highest GVL yield. The main product was isopropyl levulinate for all the ZRO catalysts. Isopropyl levulinate is not a hydrogenation product but a transesterification product. Based on the results in Fig. 3, ZRO(3) produced the highest yield of GVL among the four examined zirconium oxides for the hydrogenations of both methyl levulinate and levulinic acid. Nickels catalyst have an activity for the hydrogen transfer reaction of ketones using 2-propanol as the solvent [32]. In this study, the effects of the incorporation of nickel into the zirconium oxide were examined in order to attain a higher yield of GVL. The results are shown in Fig. 4 . For every Ni/ZRO catalyst, a significant increase in the GVL yield was observed compared to ZrO2 without Ni on the surface for the hydrogenations of both methyl levulinate and levulinic acid. Especially, the yield of GVL reached 92% for the hydrogenation of methyl levulinate over all the Ni/ZRO catalysts at 393 K for 20 h. Moreover, for the hydrogenation of levulinic acid, Ni/ZRO(3) attained an 88% GVL yield at 393 K for 20 h. As levulinic acid was harder to be hydrogenated than methyl levulinate, the differences by the catalyst types would be observed easily for levulinic acid under the present reaction conditions (393 K, 20 h). These results indicated that the combination of nickel and zirconium oxide is a promising catalyst for the transfer hydrogenation of levulinic acid and its esters, especially, JRC-ZRO-3 was found to be the best support for preparing the Ni/ZrO2 catalyst. The results of the NH3-TPD experiments (Fig. S-3) demonstrated that the amounts of acid sites were ZRO(3) > ZRO(2) ≈ ZRO(5) > ZRO(4), while the strength of the acid sites was almost the same among the four ZrO2 samples. These results were in accord with the order of the BET surface area of ZRO(x) (x = 2–5) (vide supra). Furthermore, the Ni metal surface area determined by CO adsorption (Table S-1) indicated that a higher Ni surface area resulted in the higher GVL yield especially for the levulinic acid hydrogenation. The high Ni surface area of Ni/ZRO(3) would be attributed to the high surface area of ZRO(3). Therefore, the surface area of ZrO2 would be one of the important factors for attaining a high hydrogen transfer reaction activity of methyl levulinate and levulinic acid. On the other hand, based on the results of the hydrogenation of methyl levulinate at 373 K for 5 h (Fig. S-4), the yield of GVL for ZRO(4) was slightly higher than those of ZRO(2) and ZRO(5), irrespective of the low surface area of ZRO(4) (39 m2/g) compared to that of ZRO(2) (82 m2/g) and ZRO(5) (63 m2/g). The same tendency was observed for Ni/ZROs. Ni/ZRO(4) gave more hydrogenated products (GVL + methyl 4-hydroxypentanoate). Therefore, in the case of methyl levulinate, both surface area of ZrO2 and monoclinic phase of ZrO2 would be important. In the levulinic acid case, the impregnation of Ni significantly increased the hydrogenation activity. Therefore, Ni surface area would be more important for the hydrogenation activity. As Ni/ZRO(3) showed the highest activity, the effects of the reaction temperature on the GVL yield was examined using Ni/ZRO(3) as the catalyst. Figs. 5 and 6 show the results of the methyl levulinate and levulinic acid, respectively. For the hydrogenation of methyl levulinate, more than a 94% GVL yield was attained at 373 K and 92% even at 363 K. For the hydrogenation at 393 K, although the conversion reached 100%, the GVL yield slightly decreased to 93% and the yield of isopropyl 4-hydroxypentanoate that was the transesterified product of the hydrogenated product increased. At lower than 353 K, the hydrogenation activity significantly decreased and the ratio of methyl 4-hydroxypentanoate, which was the product not lactonized, increased. Lactonization of methyl 4-hydroxypentanoate was harder to occur than the transfer hydrogenation of methyl levulinate at the lower temperatures. Calcination at 773 K, Hydrogen treatment at 673 K. Hydrogenation: 20 h. For the hydrogenation of levulinic acid, the effects of the reaction temperature were significant compared to the methyl levulinate case. Although the GVL yield was 87% at 393 K, the yield steeply decreased to 20% at 383 K. In contrast to the methyl levulinate case, 4-hydroxypentanoic acid, which is the hydrogenation product but not lactonized, was not observed. Meanwhile, the ratio of the esterified product (isopropyl levulinate) increased with the decrease in the reaction temperature. These results indicated that the transfer hydrogenation of levulinic acid was harder than that of methyl levulinate. This is the same tendency that the hydrogenations of carboxylic acids using hydrogen gas are more difficult than those of esters over heterogeneous catalysts. Meanwhile, the hydrogenated product from levulinic acid was more easily lactonized than that from methyl levulinate."
5,Role of Ni and ZrO2 in Ni/ZRO catalyst during the catalytic transfer hydrogenation,"3.3 Role of Ni and ZrO2 in Ni/ZRO catalyst during the catalytic transfer hydrogenation Based on the present study, nickel supported on zirconium oxide had a much higher activity for producing GVL for the transfer hydrogenation of both the methyl levulinate and levulinic acid compared to zirconium oxide without nickel. In order to evaluate the role of each component, i.e., the nickel and zirconium oxide, the transfer hydrogenation reactions of methyl levulinate and levulinic acid were carried out over fine nickel powder (FNiP) or zirconium oxide. The FNiP is produced by the vaporization-condensation of nickel metal in an inert gas. FNiP had as high a hydrogenation activity as the Raney Ni catalyst [33] and it contained no contamination metals, such as aluminum. Therefore, in order to qualitatively evaluate the role of nickel in Ni/ZrO2, FNiP would be the best type of nickel catalyst. The same conditions for the catalyst pre-activation and the same catalyst weight were applied for FNiP and zirconium oxide in this experiment. Fig. 7 shows the results of the hydrogen transfer reaction of methyl levulinate and levulinic acid over FNiP and ZrO2. Hydrogen treatment at 553 K for 0.5 h without pre-calcination. Hydrogenation: 20 h. As for the hydrogenation of methyl levulinate, the FNiP mainly produced methyl 4-hydroxypentanoate and GVL was the minor product, while ZrO2 mainly produced GVL and almost no 4-hydroxypentanoates were produced. These results would indicate that Ni in the Ni/ZrO2 catalyst significantly contributed to the hydrogenation of the substrate, and ZrO2 was active for both the hydrogenation and lactonization of the hydrogenated product during the methyl levulinate hydrogenation. Meanwhile, for the hydrogenation of levulinic acid, the high yield of 90% GVL was attained over FNiP at 393 K, but the yield decreased to 35% at 373 K. As almost no 4-hydroxypentanoic acid was produced at 393 K during the hydrogenation of levulinic acid, 4-hydroxypentanoic acid was more likely to change to the lactone (GVL) than methyl 4-hydroxypentanoate. On the other hand, on the ZrO2 catalyst, a very low yield of GVL was attained and the main product was not the hydrogenated product, but the esterified isopropyl levulinate. Thus, ZrO2 alone has a very low transfer hydrogenation activity for levulinic acid. As FNiP has a much higher surface area than Ni on ZrO2, Ni prepared from the reduction of NiO (HNi) was also used for the hydrogen transfer reaction of methyl levulinate (Fig. S-4). HNi has almost the same surface area as Ni on ZrO2 [34]. The results of Fig. S-4 indicate that the features of the activity of Ni and ZrO2 were the same as for the case of FNiP and ZrO2 (Fig. 7). Based on these results, it would be concluded that Ni in the Ni/ZrO2 contributed to the hydrogenations of methyl levulinate and levulinic acid and that ZrO2 assisted the lactonization of the hydrogenated product, especially for the methyl levulinate case (Fig. S-5). These tendencies were in accord with the general properties of the transfer hydrogenation activity of Ni and the esterification activity of ZrO2 as acid. In conclusion, nickel on the zirconium oxide catalyst showed a high activity for the hydrogen transfer reaction of methyl levulinate and levulinic acid to GVL using 2-propanol as the hydrogen donor. The GVL yield of 92% was attained even at 363 K for the hydrogenation of methyl levulinate, and 86% at 393 K for the hydrogenation of levulinic acid. It was found that the nickel in the Ni/ZrO2 catalyst significantly contributed to the hydrogenation of the substrate, and ZrO2 had a high activity for the lactonization of the hydrogenated product, especially for the methyl levulinate hydrogenation. Nickel and zirconium oxide showed a promising combination for the production of GVL from levulinic acid and its esters by the hydrogen transfer reaction."
