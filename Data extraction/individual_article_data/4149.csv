0,Introduction,"At the verge of fluctuating oil market and depleting fossil reserves, research on biomass chemistry for chemicals and drop-in fuels has picked up momentum, reduces oil dependency, improves air quality, and strengthens the poor farm economy [1]. Structural complexities and high oxygen content in the biomass substrate is a challenge, which calls for a novel chemical transformation route for turning them into myriad of important precursor molecules to produce desired fuels and chemicals. In this direction, significant contributions have been made in the production and valorization of lignocellulosic biomass-derived platform chemicals, which include succinic acid, lactic acid, 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (5-HMF), furfural, levulinic acid, γ-valerolactone (GVL), triacetic acid lactone (TAL) and 6-amyl-α-pyrone (6PP) by employing biological and/or chemical routes [2–9]. However, very few processes have been commercialized due to the complexities in preparation and separation techniques leading to high cost due to low substrate conversion and product yield. Possibility of byproducts formation, and the requirement of high temperature and high-pressure conditions are other limitations. Recent advances in the production of biobased hydric alcohols (e.g. diols) has witnessed the future potential for energy and chemicals demand, for their use as polymer precursor [10], fine chemical [11], drug [12], cosmetic ingredient [12,13], food supplement [14], insect repellent [15] and solvent absorbents [16]. For instance, 1,4-butandiol and 1,6-hexanediol are used predominantly as monomer for polyester, polyurethanes and Nylon-6,6 precursors production, which shares the market price of USD 4400 per ton. In contrast, 1,5-pentanediol and 2-methyl-2,4-pentane diol are identified as an important ingredient to formulate Mometasone cream used to treat skin diseases [12]. Nevertheless, 1,4-diol (C26 diol) has been reported as the block material for making advanced surfactant with better wetting and surface properties [12]. Similarly, PMD (p-methane-3,8-diol) is applied vastly to control insect [15]. On the contrary, 1,3-diol (C5-C10) have found applications in food industry for manufacturing food supplements with high energy and enhanced properties [14]. Chemical processes for the production of alkane diols from polyols (like glycerol), diacids (e.g. succinic acid) [17] and furan aldehyde (e.g. 5-HMF) [18] are well-known. However, very few studies are available for diols production from the cyclic esters like biomass-derived lactones and 2-pyrones. Due to low electrophilicity of carbonyl carbon in lactones, it requires harsh reaction conditions to selectively cleave C-O bond linkage and introduce O–H bond, difficulty in retaining the carbon number, and need of sensitive and expensive chemicals to carry out the reaction. We have previously reported 6PP as a potential biorenewable platform to carry out transformations involving ring opening-decarboxylation, Aldol condensation and transfer hydrogenation routes to produce high value chemicals [8,19]. The chemistry of linear diols for polymer applications are known for decades, however, very limited number of papers are available today in the scientific domain on branched diols applicability and their possible properties. Intrinsically in polymer industries, secondary (branched) diols possess lower reactivity than α,ω-diols, and the high boiling points of secondary diols (e.g. 2,7-octanediol) limit them in excess to drive the polymerization reaction forward. Mascal and co-workers recently proposed for using reactive diacid chlorides to circumvent these issues. Moreover, the authors further established reactivity of the diol based on chain length [20]. With increase in number of CH2 groups in the diols, there is typically a corresponding increase in Mn and Mw, indicating that the longest diol is the most reactive and least hindered by steric effects. The polymers obtained from branched diols and isosorbide showed improved polymer properties including glass transition temperature and thermal stability (TD10 and TD50) [20]. Bisguaicol based polyesters show comparable results to the Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET). PET shows thermal properties, with TgS typically around 70–80 °C and melting points (Tms) typically in excess of 200 °C [21]. The state of-the-art experiments applied today for producing diols from biomass is based on multi-step transformation route that includes hydrolysis, dehydration, ring-opening, and hydrogenation reactions that are difficult to commercialize. In order to develop a sustainable process, attempts on biological production route is continued, albeit, long reaction time with complex separation and purification steps are another challenge that needs attention to solve this issue further. As shown in Fig. 1 , we have conceptualized to integrate fermentation and catalysis to yield biorenewable hydric alcohols through a comparatively simpler step. In this paper, we have utilized existing knowledge of LAH mediated transformation chemistry to explore biomass-based lactones and 2-pyrones as a feedstock to derive various new products (branched alkane diols). Few of the product diols are currently produced from petrochemicals under high temperature and pressure conditions. Use of hydride reagent like lithium aluminium hydride (LAH) have been utilized since decades to synthesize intermediate and final product molecules for the multipurpose use due to their known chemistry. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report wherein biomass based cyclic esters such as 6PP, TAL, δ-declactone (DDL) and massoia latone (ML) are used as platform chemical to directly derive branched diols via the ring opening reaction under mild thermal conditions."
1,Experimental section,"All the lactones and pyrones are purchased from Sigma Aldrich Chemicals (India) and used without further purification. Tetrahydrofuran (THF), diethyl ether and LiAlH4 were supplied by Merck (India). THF was freshly dried by refluxing it with sodium metal and benzophenone prior to its use as solvent in the reaction."
2,Production of alkane diol/triol from biomass derived lactones and 2-pyrones using LAH,"2.1 Production of alkane diol/triol from biomass derived lactones and 2-pyrones using LAH In a typical experiment, 1 mmol reactant and 20 mL dry THF were added to a clean and dried 2-necked round bottom flask (50 mL) equipped with reflux condenser and a magnetic stir bar. Following to this, the flask containing reactant solution was placed in an ice bath to maintain temperature 0–5 °C. The reaction vessel is then flushed with nitrogen gas and maintained under the nitrogen atmosphere thereafter. To the stirred solution at 0–5 °C, desired amount of reducing agent is added portion wise. After completion of the addition, the stirring is continued for 30 min so as to confirm complete mixing of the reducing agent. Then the reaction mass was allowed to reflux at 65 °C for required time. Resultant mixture was cooled to room temperature. For quenching purpose, 15 mL diethyl ether was added to this stirred solution under nitrogen purging condition. Then 1.5 mL of distilled water was slowly added. Formation of precipitate started soon after adding freshly prepared 1 mL (10 M) NaOH solution to the resulting mixture. The whole mixture was aged at ambient temperature (for about 30 min) for the better separation of the product. The liquid product is separated by centrifugation followed by solvent extraction. The organic layer was passed through sodium sulphate to remove residual water. Product is further concentrated by evaporating organic solvent under rotary evaporator."

4,LAH assisted conversion of 2-pyrones/lactones to diols,"3.1 LAH assisted conversion of 2-pyrones/lactones to diols Lactones and pyrones are heterocyclic compounds with oxygen atom in the ring and a carbonyl group adjacent to the ring-oxygen. Reducing these resonances stabilized carbonyls are difficult due to low electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon. Strong basic reductant lithium aluminium hydride (LAH) is employed to cleave C-O bond of the cyclic esters (lactones/pyrones) via hydrogenation route to obtain corresponding diols for future applications in chemical industries. Care must be taken during the addition of LAH to avoid moisture as it violently reacts with water and can catch fire. Thus, the higher reactivity of LAH restricted the choice of solvents to hydrocarbons, tert. Amines and ethers including tetrahydrofuran (THF) [23]. When LAH (LiAlH4) is added to the stirred solution of lactones, one fourth mole equivalent of the LAH molecule was expected to get attached to the carbonyl, leading partial reduction. Upon consuming all available hydrogen, LiAlH3 is likely to formed which is supposed to react with three more lactone molecules successively until the formation of corresponding final product alkane diols and precipitate. To begin the experiment, reaction of γ-butyrolactone (GBL) [24,25] was conducted under nitrogen atmosphere over the use of LAH reagent in dry THF. Upon 8 h of refluxing, almost complete conversion of GBL was noticed, resulting 92% corresponding 1,4-butanediol (Table 1 , Entry 1). Following to this, methyl substituted GBL or γ-valarolactone (GVL) [25–28], an interesting biomass based platform molecule is tested under similar conditions. As expected, no traces of GVL are observed in product mixture (Fig. SI 1). An adequate number of papers have reported GVL as an important biobased platform molecule, yielding 1,4-pentanediol under hydrogenation conditions. Motivating with this, we included GVL in our reaction list. This result suggests that both substituted and unsubstituted lactone may undergo transformation to their alcoholic counterparts over LAH consumption. Preparing selective diols from the hydrogenation of lactone is difficult as it undergoes a series of transformation leading mixture of products. For instance, a study on copper catalyzed GVL reduction at 240 °C was found to give 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran (2MTHF), a dehydration product. In our reaction conditions, highly selective diol was obtained without any traces of any such etheric intermediates like 2MTHF (SI 2). The selective DDL formation may deduced due to the lower operating temperature compared to the results reported by Fan and co-workers [29]. This implies that, selective diol formation may likely to follow a route under reflux temperature condition. To extend the scope of biomass derived diols from 5-membered lactones, 6-membered cyclic esters such as DDL (saturated ring), ML (partially saturated ring) and 6PP (unsaturated ring) were employed (Table 1, Entry 3–6). As tabulated in Table 1, DDL yielded 91% hydric alcohol with > 99% conversion (Table 1, Entry 3; Fig. SI 3). While under similar conditions, partially saturated lactone (ML) resulted approximately 9% and 7% loss in conversion and yield of desired product respectively (Table 1, Entry 3 and 4). Dropping of conversion from DDL to ML (saturated to partially saturated lactone) can be explained by insufficient supply of hydrogen to reduce double bond of the ring followed by C-O bond cleavage to produce corresponding diol. 1H NMR study (Fig. SI 4) further support our hypothesis, showing the characteristic peaks of unconverted ML at approx. 5.5 ppm and 5.7 ppm δ-values. In 2012, Dumesic and co-workers developed triaceticacid lactone (TAL) as a platform chemical from the integration of fermentation and chemical catalysis of sugar molecules to produce variety of products of industrial applications except diols. In this study, we included TAL as a substrate to produce hexane 1,4,5-triol in THF. Upon using 3 Eq. of LAH as a reducing agent, 68% hexane 1,4,5-triol was obtained with 89% TAL conversion which is almost equivalent to the ML conversion using 2 Eq. of LAH to the substrate, ML. While under similar conditions, an analogous biobased platform molecule, 6PP gives 85 % decane-1,5-diol yield with > 99% conversion. 3.1.1 Mechanistic understanding of LAH assisted 5-hydroxydecanol formation from unsaturated lactones The plausible mechanism for the conversion of 6PP to 5-hydroxydecanol is proposed in the Scheme 1 . In the molecule C-2 carbon (carbonyl carbon) is most nucleophilc and susceptible to attack by hydride ion to give TS1, which either undergo ring-opening via intramolecular hydride transfer at C-2 (path A) to give I1 or attack of hydride ion from another LAH molecule at C-6 position via path B to give TS2. The result of ring opening via path A would be an enolate, which is stable against reduction by LAH probably due to stabilization with lithium cation (I1) and affords hydroxydecenone 1 upon water workup unlike the product obtained experimentally, i.e., diol. Hence attack at C-2 is not likely, instead the reaction proceeds through path B i.e. via attack of another LAH molecule at C-6 Position, which is further supported by NMR data where no peaks were found in range of 5.5–7.0 ppm except mesitylene (internal standard) reflects for alkene protons. In experimental study with enol acetates [30], addition of hydride to enol carbon adjacent to the ester and formation of an Al-C bond was observed as in TS2 in above mechanism. This would be in agreement for the present system under investigation since the C-6 of 6PP is also nucleophilic enough to attack by hydride from LAH. Hydroalumination product (I2) undergo ring opening via attack of hydride at C-2 position to give an intermediate I3, this is expected to occur before reduction of unsaturation, probably due to higher electrophilicity of C-2 than C-4. Finally, 1,2-addition of LAH to α-β unsaturated intermediate I3 occur via intermolecular or intramolecular mechanism, which gave 5-hydoxydecenol as final product upon water workup [30]."
5,Conclusions and outlook,"Biomass derived 2-purone molecules such as TAL, 6PP and ML are explored as precursors for alkane diols synthesis. In order to investigate scope of the process, saturated lactones such as DDL, GBL and GVL were further utilized and converted into their corresponding alcohol in one step reaction using LiAlH4. The reactions were observed to be proceed via the ring opening reaction. Formation of hydroxyl alkanols takes place via sequential hydrogenation of double bond of the lactone ring followed by ring opening to corresponding products. Moreover, it has the potential to transform into a myriad of different products used to synthesize for sorbents and skincare applications. Utilizing our concept of deriving new biobased molecules (hydric alcohols), an atom-economic and environmentally friendly process based on heterogeneous catalysis may be established in the future to produce branched diols from various biobased lactone and pyrone molecules. With unique structure, tunable properties and reaction activities, hydric alcohols have been known to be important synthetic intermediate for manufacturing polymer, fine chemicals and commodity products. The obtained diols may get oxidized to give diacids, another important monomer for polymer industry [31]. In recent studies, pentanediols and hexanediols production from furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural have been reported. Among various diols, 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD), 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PD), 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BD) and 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BD) have shown significant trends in the biotechnological production [32]. Purification steps in the fermentation route is energy intensive and time consuming process. The chemical catalytic route is comparatively less time consuming, but it also has some limitations such as the requirement of high temperature, pressure and expensive chemicals resulting high cost of the overall process including low conversion of the desired products. Thus, producing alkanediols from corresponding lactones could be considered as a promising approach to address the problem of sustainability. Eventually, the process is effective for retaining the carbon numbers which is essential in making long chain hydric alcohols for polymer and surfactant applications."
