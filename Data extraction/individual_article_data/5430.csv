0,Introduction,"With the increased demand in energy resources, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) provides a promising solution to futuristic energy supply by an electrocatalytic reduction of water to molecular hydrogen (H2). However, the simple reaction requires noble metal catalysts, such as Pt, Ir, and Pd or metal oxides to achieve low overpotential and fast reaction kinetics which are critical for large scale applications [1–5]. In this perspective, finding low-cost but highly efficient alternatives replacing the current Pt-catalysts is very much desirable to accomplish long-term environmental sustainability. The exorbitant cost and low abundance of precious metals not only impedes large scale commercial applications but also have notable disadvantages like metal corrosion, gas poisoning, poor durability, and detrimental environmental impact. Of late, a wide variety of base metals such as Co, Ni, Fe, Mo etc. and their compounds have been investigated to improve the electrocatalytic activity [6–11], but the inherent corrosion and oxidation susceptibility largely confines their application in acidic proton-exchange membrane-based electrolysis system [12–16]. Alternatively, carbon-based materials (carbo-catalysis) feature unique advantageous for designated catalysis due to their modifiable carbon substructure, abundance, and high tolerance to a wide range of pH environments. Advancement in carbon nanostructures have also triggered their scope as metal-free catalysts in energy conversion and storage technologies, but in the energy prototype, there are great challenges in the water-splitting in terms of sluggish reaction kinetics, catalyst stability/durability, and production cost [17,18]. In the early stage of carbo-catalysis, the abundant surface/edge defects of carbon nanostructures were explored for both conventional and electro-catalysis. Encouraged with the recent progress made with carbon nanomaterials in terms of synthesis, intensive research efforts have been made in the field of (electro)catalysis using carbon materials, which resulted in a new class of carbon catalysts called heteroatom or N-atom doped analogue which has the potential to replace the Pt in the ORR in fuel cell catalysis [19]. For instance, N-doped few layer graphene sheets and nitrogen-containing meso-structured carbons have shown good HER and OER activities [20–22]. It is also well documented through computational study that, the N atom local chemical environment can also modify the electronic structure of adjacent carbon atoms by inductive effect, thus leading to different catalytic properties. Insight into the catalytic activity of N-doped graphene and CNTs suggest that the electronegativity of N (χ = 3.07) and C (χ = 2.55) as well as the difference in size between N and C atoms distorts the lattice structure to cause changes in both physical properties (electronic, magnetic, and photonic properties) as well as chemical properties leading to various new applications like metal-free (electro)catalysis [23]. It has been demonstrated recently that the N-doped graphene and nitrogen-rich polymers show water splitting activity exceeding those of traditional IrO2 nanoparticles [24]. Furthermore, the N content also shown to influences catalytic activity, as exemplified by the improved electrocatalytic activity of N-doped CNT catalysts [25]. In another strategy, heteroatoms other than nitrogen (ca. B, P, O) as well as co-doping of N/S, N/B, and N/P in the carbon matrix were investigated for OER and HER catalysis to enhance the overall performance [26–29]. Meanwhile, morphological aspects have aroused considerable interest due to well-defined morphology, especially nanowires, nanosheets, and multimodal pore architecture furnish impressive catalytic activity due to facile electrolyte percolation, large surface area, and short diffusion lengths for the transport of active species. Similarly, hierarchical porous materials have been emphasized owing to their merits in terms of facile ionic diffusion, facile adsorption of protons, and stability of the catalyst [30–32]. In this context, MWCNT, graphene, and synthetic activated carbon based catalysts were extensively investigated for wide range of applications including energy storage, OER, and HER electrocatalysis [7,33–37]. Metal-free carbon-based catalysts have garnered great attention for a range of potential applications due not only to their textural properties (surface area and pore size), excellent electrical and electrochemical properties but also due to their high natural abundance and affordability. Of particular interest, designing a carbon nanostructure from cheap biomass sources has a great deal of interest owing to scalability, sustainability, and technological viability but remains a challenging task. Extensive research efforts have also been made to create low-dimensional carbo-catalysts from abundant biomass sources as well as waste materials for energy conversion and storage applications. Diverse natural sources such as orange peel [38], aloevera [39], food waste [40], soya-bean [41], rice husks [42], peanut root nodules [43] etc. have been investigated to design nanoscale carbons, which upon chemical activation with reagents such as KOH, H3PO4, ZnCl2 etc. provides activated carbons with attractive morphological and textural features [44,45]. However, these biomass derived carbon materials seldom applied for HER catalysis so far. Recently, Zhang et al. and Liu et al. have independently reported honeycomb-like carbon nanosheets from silk cocoon and pine-needle-derived N-doped microporous carbons from biomass exhibiting incredible catalytic performance as well as promising electrochemical durability [46]. Herein, we have developed a facile and low-cost hierarchical porous nanosheet (HPNS) carbons as an efficient hydrogen evolution catalyst derived from natural dry spathe-pollen waste of palm plant (Palmyra spathe-pollen). The present work highlights an elegant facile pyrolysis route to obtain carbon nanosheets with implanted N atoms innate from renewable sources [47,48] with large BET surface area, narrow pore diameter ∼1.0–5.0 nm, and sheet-like morphology with thickness of 4.0–10 nm. The physicochemical properties of as-synthesized carbon (pristine carbon) and KOH activated materials (HPNS) were evaluated by state-of-the-art characterization techniques. The palm waste activated carbon material reveals higher electrocatalytic activity towards HER activity with low overpotential (ɳ), small Tafel slopes, and long-term durability in acidic medium. The use of hierarchical 2D nanoporous nanosheets (HPNS) not only overcomes the inherent susceptibility of transition metal based catalysts to corrosion and oxidation but also circumvent the high-cost and low-abundance of platinum based catalysts."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and reagents,"2.1 Materials and reagents Hydrochloric acid (AR grade), KOH (AR grade) and H2SO4 (AR grade) were purchased from Merck chemicals, India, and were used as purchased. Super-P carbon (carbon black 99%), ruthenium oxide (RuO2, 99.99%), platinum on carbon (20 wt% Hi-Spec), and Nafion® solution in low aliphatic alcohols (5%) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich, India. All the materials were used without any further purification and Millipore water was used for entire preparative works."
3,Synthesis of hierarchical porous carbon sheets from palm waste material,"2.2 Synthesis of hierarchical porous carbon sheets from palm waste material High surface hierarchical 2D porous nanosheets (HPNS) were synthesized from the palm waste materials. The collected solid material from flower bunch of Indian palm tree was dried under the sun at ambient temperature for two days and subsequently broken in to small pieces. Further it was ground into a fine powder by hand grinding. The well ground powder was subjected to carbonization by heating at 450 °C for 2 h under N2 atmosphere in a tubular furnace at a ramping rate of 5 °C min−1. The resultant material was denoted as pristine-carbon for subsequent discussion. The raw carbon material was collected and further activated with KOH simply by grinding the raw carbons with KOH in the ratio of 1:3 followed by activation at 750 °C for 3 h under N2 atmosphere. The fluffy carbon material was collected and washed thoroughly with Millipore water mixed with few drops of 0.1 M hydrochloric acid until it attains a neutral pH. The sample was further washed thrice with water and ethanol consecutively followed by centrifugation to recover the solid. Finally, the base activated carbon material was dried at 60 °C for overnight in a hot air oven. The resultant KOH activated hierarchical porous nanosheet was denoted as HPNS for subsequent discussion."
4,Physicochemical characterization,"2.3 Physicochemical characterization The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out using BRUKER (Model: D8 Advanced Twin) X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) to study the crystallinity of the carbon materials. The functional groups present in the carbon material was analysed by FTIR spectroscopy using a BRUKER (Model: TENSOR 27) OPTIK spectrometer, Germany, by KBr pellet technique. The graphitic nature and the surface defects of the carbons were evaluated using Micro Raman using HORIBA, (Model: LABRAM HR evolution) spectrometer with a laser light incident wavelength of 632 nm and the laser power of 40% can be utilized with high resolution scan. The porosity and the surface area of the sample were measured by Quantachrome N2 adsorption/desorption analyser (Model: Autosorb IQ series). The size and morphology of the material were analysed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM, TESCAN, Model: VEGA 3SBH) using test sample dispersed in ethanol. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained with JEOL instrument (Model: JEM-2100 Plus) operating at 200 kV by coating the test sample on carbon coated copper grid. The surface roughness of the carbon materials were measured using Atomic force microscopy of Agilent Technologies (Model: SPM 5500 keysight technologies). The nature and composition of elements present in the activated carbon was estimated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), with a Thermo Fisher (MultiLab 2000) spectrometer, fitted with a twin anode X-ray source using Mg-Kα radiation (1253.6 eV) and the spectra was fitted to resolve the spectral lines. Electrochemical data were obtained using Biologic electrochemical workstation (VSP-300) at ambient condition in a three electrode setup. All the outputs produced by the instrument were pre-corrected for iR resistive signals."
5,Electrochemical characterization,2.4 Electrochemical characterization The electrochemical properties were evaluated in a three-electrode cell setup using HPNS modified glassy carbon (GC) electrode as a working electrode and graphite as a counter electrode. The mercury/mercurous sulphate with 0.5 M H2SO4 (MMS) serves as a reference electrode for acid medium and silver/silver chloride with 3.0 M KCl for alkaline medium in 1.0 M KOH as an electrolyte. All the measured potentials in the electrochemical experiments were converted into reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by standard formula (refer supporting information). The GC working electrodes were modified by the standard protocol used in the literature [49] to prepare the catalyst ink and coating on the GC electrode. The detailed procedure of the GC electrode modification using carbon material is shown in the supporting information. The HPNS modified GC electrode was used to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity towards HER.
6,Theoretical calculations,"2.5 Theoretical calculations DFT calculations were performed with the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) [50]. The projector amplified wave function pseudopotentials within a 500 eV energy cut-off were used for the calculations [51]. Structure optimizations were carried out until all forces in the system were less than 0.01 eVÅ−1. ΔEd and ΔE2 were calculated using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional [52] with the Tkatchenko–Scheffler dispersion correction (TS) [53] (because PBE-TS lattice constants and reaction energies are generally regarded as reliable), and ΔGH* values were calculated via revised PBE (RPBE) function with TS (because the RBPE-TS adsorption energy is more reliable in adsorption free energies) [54]. The work function was calculated from the PBE-TS band structures. To simulate the experimental environment better, first we inspected the adsorption energy of carbon in two different kinds of nitrogen-doped environments, and then we inspect the mixed nitrogen environments to identify the energetically favourable structure for the calculation of hydrogen binding energy (HBE)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Physicochemical characterization,"3.1 Physicochemical characterization The HPNS nanostructured activated carbons derived from the palm waste (spathe-pollen) mainly consists of polysaccharides (15–35%), and nitrogeneous organic compounds like amino acids, peptides, and proteins (15–20%) with abundant nitrogen atoms [55,56]. Scheme 1 depicts the stepwise synthesis and morphological features of HPNS obtained from the palm waste and the presence of different functional groups on the surface of carbon was identified by FTIR spectra. Both the pristine (black line) and activated HPNS (red line) carbons show (Fig. 1 A) vibrational bands at 1198, 1598, 2394, 2887 and 3438 cm−1, corresponding to ‒C=C‒, ‒C=N, ‒C=O (CO2), –CH, and ‒OH, respectively. The FTIR spectrum of pristine as well as HPNS confirms the presence of nitrogen as reflected from the band at ∼1200 cm−1 due to ‒C=N‒O functionality as shown in Fig. 1A [57]. The degree of graphitization of carbon materials was estimated by Raman spectra (Fig. 1B), which shows two distinct peaks at ∼1340 and 1585 cm−1 corresponding to D band and G band, respectively. The D band refers to the disordered or curved graphitic sheets with under-coordinated dangling bonds representing lattice vibrational mode of A 1g symmetry; whereas G band is assigned to E 2g symmetry of in-plane stretching mode of sp 2 carbon of layered graphitic structures [58,59]. Though the graphitic G band was more intense in the pristine-carbon, reduced peak intensity and broadened signal features were obvious after KOH activation, which indicates –OH functionalization along the basal plane of graphite followed by delamination of the layered structures. Since more defect sites are introduced during KOH activation, the D band intensity increases appreciably. Estimation of defect site content through I D /I G ratio revealed that the activated HPNS has high I D /I G = 1.03 compared with pristine-carbon (I D /I G = 0.71). These results clearly confirm the graphene nanosheets enriched with a high degree of edge as well as surface defects which would be expected to promote HER catalytic performance [60,61]. The degree of crystallinity of the as-synthesized pristine-carbon and HPNS nanostructures was evaluated using XRD, which confirmed the poor crystallinity for both the carbon samples. The pristine-carbon exhibited diffraction peaks at 24.5⁰ and 43.5⁰, whereas HPNS nanostructure showed reflections at 23.9⁰ and 43.5⁰ that can be correlated to (002) and (101) planes, respectively. The appreciable peak shift from 24.5⁰ to 23.9⁰ and feature of (002) peak broadening after KOH activation suggest an enlarged interlayer separation of layered materials corroborating very well the Raman spectral results discussed above. The broadening of 43.5⁰ reflection and increase in full-width half-maximum (FWHM) signifies a low-degree of graphitization of HPNS carbon nanosheets [62]. Fig. 2 B illustrates nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of HPNS measured at liquid nitrogen temperature, 77 K. The HPNS shows N2 sorption at low-partial pressure (p/p0 < 0.3) characteristics of Type I isotherms according to IUPAC classification and on close inspection at partial pressure p/p0 > 0.3, the presence of Type IV hysteresis loop is quite obvious indicating the presence of large mesopores [63]. The unique combination of large BET surface area (1297 m2 g−1), dual micro/mesoporous architectures, narrow size pores distribution (1.3–4.2 nm), and high pore volume (0.6 cm3 g−1) are indeed originated from interlayer separation/voids created by the evolution of different gaseous products and incorporation of –OH groups along the carbon network. The abundant BET surface area vis-à-vis active sites would be expected to enhance the electrocatalytic activity through reversible adsorption/desorption of H+ species on the catalyst surface [64]. The existence of large mesopores and morphological features were further confirmed from electron microscope techniques (FESEM and HRTEM). Fig. 3 A–B shows the FESEM micrographs of pristine-carbon and HPNS, where the former consists of numerous macropores of size about 2.0–15 μm. However, the HPNS carbon exhibits rather transparent thin sheet like structures assembled together to form sponge like textures and also some of the sheets were well separated and have curled morphology. Furthermore, the existence of hierarchical pores in the HPNS was further evidenced from SEM images (Fig. S1, supplementary) as well as HR-TEM images (Fig. 3C–D). The formation of graphene-like carbon nanosheets is further verified with high resolution TEM, where the micrographs (Fig. 3C–D) show size features of 50–100 nm length with thickness of ∼ 4–10 nm. The magnified image further reveals crumbled or twined sheets creating more surface/edge defect sites which would be expected to favour adsorption of H+ during the electrocatalytic reactions [64]. Fig. S2 (supplementary) depicts the EDAX spectrum and compositional details of HPNS, where the amount of N-content was found to be 10.5 at.%. The trace amount of potassium present could have originated during the KOH activation process. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. S3, supplementary) shows a rather smooth diffused ring pattern confirming the amorphous or semi-crystalline nature of HPNS corroborating the XRD results discussed in earlier section. The chemical composition of HPNS and local environment of respective elements were identified using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Fig. 4 A illustrates the survey spectrum of HPNS with signals at 285 eV, 535 eV, and 400 eV corresponding to core level C 1s, O 1s, and N 1s, respectively, in agreement with EDAX results discussed above. The individual elements were peak-fitted using XPSPEAK software within the error limit of χ 2 values less than 2. Fig. 4B represents core level C 1s spectrum of the HPNS that can be further deconvoluted into four distinct peaks located at 284.1, 285.3, 286.1, and 287.4 eV corresponding to carbon environments of –C=C‒, ‒C=N‒, C‒OH, and O‒C=O groups, respectively. Likewise, N 1s core level spectrum (Fig. 4C) can be deconvoluted in to three signals located at 398.3 eV, 400.2 eV, and 403.5 eV which are assigned to pyridinic, pyrrolic/graphitic, and pyridine oxide species, respectively [65,66]. The amount of N present in each local environment was also estimated through peak area integration and the values for pyridinic, pyrrolic/graphitic, and pyridine oxide were found to be 35, 47, and 18 at.%, respectively. It is strongly believed from literature that pyridinic, pyrrolic, and pyridonic N atoms at edge/defect sites could promote the H+ adsorption and desorption process during HER reaction [66,67]. The O 1s spectrum has two distinct peak located at 531.6 and 532.3 eV which are assigned to O=C‒O and O=C functionalities, respectively (Fig. 4D). Thus the results obtained from XPS, EDAX, and FTIR complement with each other and confirms the presence of C, N & O elements in the HPNS materials. Thus characterized material was further investigated for electrocatalytic HER activity."
9,Electrochemical characterization of HPNS,"3.2 Electrochemical characterization of HPNS The efficiency of HPNS catalyst towards HER was investigated under alkaline (1.0 M KOH) as well as acidic media (0.5 M H2SO4) at ambient conditions. Fig. S4 depicts the HER activity of HPNS in 1.0 M KOH, which reflects a typical onset potential of −0.4 V and overpotential of 0.7 V at standard current of 10 mA cm−2. Furthermore, due to adsorption of OH− species on the HPNS electrode surface when using KOH as electrolyte, poor HER activity was observed unlike the performance under acidic medium similar to the previous literature reports [68,69]. The initial HER performance optimization under acidic medium was carried out with cyclic voltammetry (CV) in the potential window of −0.32 to 0.18 V for 100 cycles (only selected cycles are shown for clarity) with simultaneous recording of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at the end of every 25th cycles at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. Fig. 5 A depicts the selected CV traces with insignificant change in the profiles on increasing the number of scans from 1 to 100. To our surprise, however, the corresponding LSV polarization curves (Fig. 5B) exhibit appreciable enhancement in the magnitude of hydrogen evolution current. Such an improvement in HER activity of carbo-catalyst under acidic conditions is attributed to creation of several new active sites or modified surface which could also possibly promote the HER activity [64,70]. For instance, apart from increased ECSA, the in-situ formation of surface N-containing groups such as NH or NH2 under acidic medium could favour the HER reaction. The enhanced HER catalytic activity of HPNS electrode is further confirmed with accelerated durability test of up to 1000 LSV scans in 0.5 M H2SO4 at 100 mV s−1 scan rate (Fig. S5). Unlike the initial 100 scans, the improvement was very miniscule in terms of current enhancement and alteration of overpotential especially after 100 scans. The change in the HER current response and overpotential were found to be 5 mA cm−2 and 3 mV, respectively even after 1000 scans, which indeed corroborate the electrode surface activation during initial 100 CV scans under acidic electrolytes and thereafter, the surface gets saturated. In general, an ideal HER catalyst should furnish a high current response at minimal overpotential, and small HER potential against commercial Pt/C catalyst. Fig. 6 A compares the LSV polarization curves of HPNS with commercial Pt/C, RuO2, and Super P carbon catalysts. To get more insight into the influence of N present in HPNS, we compared the HER activity of HPNS with Super P carbon (N is absent) with similar surface roughness. The surface roughness of Super P and HPNS measured with atomic force microscopy (AFM) was found to be 16.4 and 15.1, respectively and the AFM histograms were included in Fig. S6 (supplementary). To our surprise, the nanostructured HPNS produce H2 at low overpotential, demonstrating its potency as an efficient HER electrocatalysts. The observed overpotential of HPNS is also comparable with other metal and carbon based HER electrocatalysts [20,71,72]. The overpotential (η), a maximum current response to a minimum applied potential is a measure of efficiency of HER activity and generally, η HER at 1.0, 10, or 100 mA cm−2 are considered as benchmark value to evaluate the performance of any catalyst [73]. From Fig. 6A, the dotted horizontal line represents the benchmark current of 10 mA cm−2 used to compare the overpotential value of HPNS with other commercially established catalysts. To our surprise, the HPNS realized an overpotential of 0.33 V @ 10 mA cm−2, which is significantly lower and also comparable with several reported metal, metal-oxide, and carbon-based catalysts [20,71,72]. Fig. 6B presents current response vs. applied potential graph, where the average values of three repetitive measurements along with error bars are provided. The HPNS exhibits a better current response after reaching 0.38 V with almost a linear response with incremental increase in the overpotential. To get more insight into the HER activity of HPNS electrode, we further calculated hydrogen binding energy (HBE) of HPNS material since HBE is one of the activity descriptor. The HBE value of HPNS and the undoped carbon (Super-P) were measured using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. For HPNS, the calculation was performed by incorporating nitrogen atoms in the carbon skeleton of HPNS and the value was found to be 8.3 kJ mol−1. The detailed DFT procedure is described in the experimental section. The observed result is comparable with the previous report on porous carbon material with high surface area (3103 m2 g‒1) and pore diameter (1–3 nm) derived from Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) with HBE value of 8.5 kJ mol−1 [74]. Similarly, the HBE was also calculated for undoped carbon (Super-P) by considering a sheet-like carbon with a thickness of 5 nm. The structure was optimised and the H2 adsorption energy was analysed. The measured HBE value of the undoped carbon was found to be 6.2 kJ mol‒1. Since the HBE is directly related to the HER activity, the nitrogen presence in the carbon surface and the pore size of the HPNS has positive influence over adsorption of H2, as reflected in the HER electrocatalytic activity. To further understand electrocatalytic behaviour of HPNS, the HER kinetics was considered. Tafel slope is an important parameter to obtain mechanistic insight into H2 evolution pathway and is generally extracted from the linear portions on the onset region of the polarization curves, where the initial H2 evolution begins. The most common pathways of hydrogen production are listed below [61,75]: (1) Volmer step: Had ↔ H+ + e‒ (120 mV dec−1) (2) Heyrovsky step: H2 ↔ Had + H+ + e‒ (40 mV dec−1) (3) Tafel step: H2 ↔ 2Had (30 mV dec−1) To predict the efficacy of HPNS catalyst towards HER, its performance was compared against benchmark commercially established catalytic systems as shown in Fig. 6C using Tafel slope values. The calculated Tafel slope values were 34.5, 47.0, 63.0, and 124.0 mV.dec−1 for Pt/C, RuO2, HPNS, and Super P, respectively and the value of HPNS is also comparable with previously reported catalysts [68]. The lower Tafel slope value of HPNS signifies fast proton discharge and quick electron transfer processes [61] and therefore, at low overpotential, HER kinetics probably follows a combination of the Volmer- and parallel Heyrovsky steps. To get further insight into HER activity of the carbo-catalyst, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were performed to probe the charger-transfer resistance at different overpotentials. Fig. 7 shows Nyquist plots fitted with Randle's equivalent circuit to estimate the R ct values. The decreased R ct values for HPNS on increasing the overpotential clearly indicate fast electron transfer kinetics. Additionally, electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) is a key indicator to predict effective available working area for catalysis since hydrogen evolution is very facile for catalyst with high ECSA [51,69]. For calculation of ECSA, several CV curves were recorded at different scan rates in the potential window of −0.32 V–0.18 V (Fig. S7), where the obtained current response at 0.05 V is assumed exclusively due to capacitive behaviour (non-Faradaic process). Using these CV data, current density (mA/cm2) vs. scan rate (mV/s) was plotted (Fig. 6D) to estimate the double layer capacitance (C dl ). Since the C dl directly gives an idea of ECSA of a catalyst material [76,77], where the higher C dl reflects high ECSA vis-à-vis catalytic performance. The C dl value of HPNS was estimated to be 7.86 mF cm−2 demonstrating the presence of more active sites vis-à-vis superior HER activity. The ECSA values estimated using C dl value (7.86 mF cm−2) was found to be 61.4 cm2 g−1 which further explains the observed better HER activity of HPNS. In addition to the critical parameters discussed above, the electrochemical stability of HER catalyst plays a vital role for practical applications and the long-term stability of HER catalysts can be determined by chronopotentiometric (CP) studies. For this purpose, three different static current signals (5.0, 10, and 15 mA cm−2) were applied as inputs and the potential responses were recorded for about 300 s. It is noted from Fig. 8 that the potential response at 10 mA cm−2 input current was quiet steady and very stable with insignificant performance deterioration. To further analyse the long term stability, an input current of 10 mA. cm−2 was applied for 10 h and the potential response was recorded. It is seen from Fig. 9 that the HPNS catalyst is quite stable with negligible deterioration of catalytic activity. To predict any change in the HER activity, LSV polarization curves were recorded before and after 10 h of chronopotentiometric test (Fig. 9, inset). Evidently, no significant change was observed in the polarization curves, which clearly proves that HPNS has an excellent stability without performance degradation. Thus, the less negative potential, small overpotential, and high double layer capacitance vis-à-vis effective electrochemical surface area (ECSA) very well corroborate the high HER catalytic activity of HPNS."
10,Conclusions,"In this report, we have demonstrated an efficient graphene-like hierarchical porous nanosheet (HPNS) with high surface area from palm waste as an efficient HER catalysts. FESEM and HRTEM observation as well as nitrogen sorption studies suggested graphene like sheet structures with hierarchical micro/mesopore architecture, large BET specific surface area of 1297 m2 g−1, and high pore volume of 0.6 cm3 g−1. The XPS spectra confirmed the presence of high nitrogen content (10.5%) innate from biomass precursors. The high ratio of I D /I G band (1.03) of HPNS observed from Raman spectra indicated a defect-rich carbon structure. The HPNS exhibited excellent HER activity in acidic medium than in the alkaline conditions. Tested as HER catalyst, the HPNS showed minimum overpotential (η 10 ) of −0.33 V at 10 mA cm−2, a small Tafel slope value 63 mV/dec. and high durability in 0.5 M H2SO4 medium. The observed better HER activity of HPNS can be very well correlated with its higher HBE (8.3 kJ mol‒1) compared to undoped commercial carbon (Super P, 6.2 kJ mol‒1). The present biomass derived graphene like nanosheet catalysts from cheap biomass source could serve as a potential HER catalyst and its application potential can be further extended for other energy conversion and storage fields."
