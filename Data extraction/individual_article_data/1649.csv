0,Introduction,"In contemporary society over the years, the reliance on petroleum-based plastics has been extensively increased and it is also widely reported that the ubiquitous plastic has posed a severe anthropogenic issue in the coastal and marine ecosystems over the world (Thushari and Senevirathna, 2020). The progressive depletion of fossil fuel and adverse environmental impacts of petroleum-based plastics have become the driving force of the research pursuing novel biodegradable materials. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a class of bioplastic that can be synthesised naturally through the bacterial fermentation of carbon-based feedstock under nutrient-limited growth conditions. These green plastics are reported to pose a positive social and environmental impact compared to petrochemical-based plastics as they diminish landfill requirements without causing pollution (Mohammed et al., 2019). Due to their outstanding biodegradable and biocompatible properties, PHAs have become a promising alternative to substitute petrochemical-based plastics. However, the tremendously high investment and operational costs render the bioplastic difficult for achieving competitive pricing levels against petrochemical-based plastics at present. It is criticised that the conventional PHA production process that utilises the high-cost pure carbon sources such as glucose and sugars become a limiting factor for industrial application of PHA production (Aslan et al., 2016). Hence, it is pivotal to identify alternative cheap feedstock to replace the expensive carbon source to lower the intensely high production cost. The recent study of reclamation and reuse of wastewater sludge as the feedstock for PHA production emerges to be a revolutionary strategy to provide waste treatment and obtain wealth from waste concurrently. The exploitation of anaerobic digestion intermediate generated from the wastewater treatment process, particularly volatile fatty acids (VFA) during the acidogenesis stage serves as the paramount precursors in various biorefinery processes, including PHAs (Perez-Zabaleta et al., 2021). The examples of studied food processing and daily industrial wastes for PHA production include cheese whey hydrolysate (Kucera et al., 2018), paper mill wastewater (Bengtsson et al., 2008), rice mill effluent (Sabapathy et al., 2018), etc. One of the state-of-the-art approaches proposed by the researchers for minimising the high capital investment and operating cost of bioplastic production processes is by integrating the process into the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which allows the utilisation of already built installations, i.e. the anaerobic fermenter (Crutchik et al., 2020). Nonetheless, the development of commercialisation and industrialisation of waste-derived PHA synthesis processes are still at a bottleneck despite extensive research in pilot-scale studies. The limited economic evaluation and efficient material recovery strategies from wastewater sludge are reported to be the causes for hindering the progression of the industrial-scale development of waste-derived PHA synthesis processes (Crutchik et al., 2020). Hence, a systematic framework that is felicitous on addressing and optimising the resources in the industrialisation of the PHA synthesis process is critical to accelerating the substitution of petrochemical-based plastic with bioplastic. In the context of process integration within the existing WWTPs, the employment of an eco-industrial park (EIP) could be a viable solution for achieving a more sustainable waste-derived bioplastic production from the perspective of both economic and environmental pillars. The establishment of EIP has been reported to effectively minimise waste generation and enhance regional eco-industrial development as demonstrated by various cases in the real world (Kim et al., 2018). One of the notable examples of integration of biorefineries for waste valorisation is Ulsan EIP in South Korea. Along with splendid economic and social benefits, the development of EIP in Ulsan has manifested magnificent progress towards waste valorisation, resource recovery, and air pollution mitigation (Shah et al., 2020). An optimal mass integration design is certainly a key aspect in the planning stage of EIP development. A trailblazing idea for the integration framework was introduced by Noureldin and El-Halwagi, in which atomic targeting approach is employed to benchmark the network performance (Noureldin and El-Halwagi, 2015). Unlike other mass-integration frameworks that construct benchmarks at the chemical-species level, the fundamental part of the framework suggested by Noureldin and El-Halwagi is the realization of multicriteria objectives by tracking individual carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms inside the designed network, which is also known as carbon-hydrogen-oxygen symbiosis network (CHOSYN). The implementation of the atomic targeting approach in CHOSYN allows the identification of benchmarks required for determining the overall reactions needed to reach the pre-allocated targets of the participating plants based on the atomic-level information, which can be regarded as a more insightful and efficacious method relative to other conventional approaches that based on species and plant level (Noureldin and El-Halwagi, 2015). In general, the process integration approaches relating to forming an EIP have been effectively enhanced the profitability of the industrial process plants through the minimisation of resource consumption and waste generation in many cases (Foo et al., 2017). Thus, it is anticipated that significant improvement in the economic and environmental sustainability of the PHA synthesis process would be achieved through the application of the process and material integration framework. Despite that the CHOSYN has been studied in various applications, there is a lack of research on the implementation of the CHOSYN concept to optimise the waste-derived bioplastic production process to resolve the stalling development in commercialisation and industrialisation of the PHA synthesis process. Hence, this paper delivers a novel multi-criteria optimisation model to enhance the resource recovery of PHA synthesis process by adopting the carbon-hydrogen-oxygen (CHO) framework along with an atomic targeting approach for the construction of benchmarks. The paper presents the optimal conceptual design of CHOSYN based on the proposed case study to provide an insight into the mass integration within the EIP involving the PHA synthesis process. The sustainability improvement of the integrated PHA synthesis process is evaluated based on economic and environmental sustainability metrics. The outcome of this paper would contribute to a better direction in assisting plant engineers and researchers by providing a rigorous design approach to minimise resource consumption in the bioplastic production process and handle the sludge management problem in the biorefinery industry concurrently."
1,Literature review,
2,CHO symbiosis network,"2.1 CHO symbiosis network Systematic design of EIP is regarded as an established field of industry ecology (IE) study focused on materials and energy flows within the territorial production system (Martín Gómez et al., 2018). The concepts of IE have been extensively applied in different industrial sectors for sustainable development. For instance, Jerez et al. addressed the essential for the development of innovative technologies associated with circular economy and environmental sustainability to cope with the disposal of these hazardous oily sludge and enhance positive economic impact in the refining scheme (Jerez et al., 2021). The IE-based symbiotic system approach is also implemented in Indian municipal solid waste to provide simultaneous economic and environmental evaluation for the establishment of a sustainable municipal solid waste management system (Singh and Basak, 2018). As one of the few countries with the fastest-growing major economy, China is also involved in pioneering circular economy implementation and employed in various industries to improve resource efficiency (Ogunmakinde, 2019). In a study of optimizing the wastewater treatment system in the Chinese industrial parks presented by Hu et al. (Hu et al., 2020), the industrial symbiosis-based model is proposed by reusing organic matters in wastewaters as the external carbon source and it is reported that the model reflects outstanding performance in overall cost-savings potential and reduction of carbon emissions. The high cyclic structure of the symbiotic network is crucial for boosting economic growth while concurrently preserving the environment (Genc et al., 2020). While the PHA synthesis process using wastewater sludge as the raw materials is considered as a decent approach towards the circular economy principles, it is also concerned to envision a higher level of synergism of different biorefinery plants in exchanging useful by-products and wastes that can be recycled as the feedstock for further usage to improve the cyclicity. This work aspires that systematic material integration and waste recycling with a higher cyclicity of the symbiotic network results in a more sustainable waste-derived PHA synthesis process. An effective multi-criteria optimisation method is pivotal when dealing with decision-making problems such as optimal utilisation of a certain resource in the presence of trade-offs between several conflicting objectives. Mathematical programming approaches that involve the theory and computational solution of mathematical models are suitable for solving the aforementioned complex problem. One of the most notable mathematical programming approaches for addressing multi-criterion objectives is the fuzzy optimisation technique. For instance, Ahangar et al. proposed fuzzy programming approach in the design of a sustainable municipal solid waste disposal system to structure for minimisation in total costs and generated pollutants as well as maximisation in social aspects (Sadeghi Ahangar et al., 2021). The fuzzy decision-making technique is also employed by Tseng et al. to identify the attributes with causal interrelationships and qualitative information under uncertainties in an EIP transition (Tseng et al., 2021). Aside from the fuzzy optimisation approach, the optimisation of the chemical species resources in the process can also be performed by tracking specific atoms to establish multiscale benchmarks, which is known as the ‘multiscale atomic targeting approach’ (M.M. El-Halwagi, 2017). By understanding the fact that carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are the primary blocks for certain chemical species such as biomass and hydrocarbons, Noureldin and El-Halwagi formulated CHOSYN for realizing a structured integration of multiple hydrocarbons plants with the existence of shared centralized facilities that enable exchange, conversion, separation, treatment, and mixing of streams (Nhuchhen, 2016; Noureldin and El-Halwagi, 2015). As the focus of CHOSYN emanates from the atomic level (C, H, and O) of the symbiosis network, it encompasses the research works that were based on specific species and thus provides a more insightful sustainability evaluation. El-Halwagi soon followed up with an algebraic shortcut approach to simplify the previous development of CHOSYNs with the reference of atomic and stoichiometric information (M.M. El-Halwagi, 2017). The design of CHOSYNs with the implementation of a multiscale optimisation approach has made remarkable contributions in addressing complex sustainability problems. Table 1 summarises the examples of notable CHOSYN studies to deal with multi-criterion objectives. Prior studies suggest that the creation of CHOSYN provides valuable benchmarks and insights in developing sustainable EIP with splendid performance in the environmental and economic aspects as compared to the non-CHOSYN cases. However, the research works thus far are related to optimisation of CHOSYN design by interpreting the hydrocarbon-based EIP with the incorporation of different key criteria and programming approaches. Thus, there is no specific study that emphasises the CHOSYN concept in solving the sludge management problem and promote the development of biorefinery EIP by targeting minimum consumption of resources and generation of waste. Since C, H, and O atoms are also elementary building blocks for biochemicals, the paper presents an avant-garde idea of linking the CHOSYN concept with the proposed biorefinery EIP associated with the optimisation study of bioplastic production processes. The paper aspires to present an optimal design of CHOSYN through a case study using a mathematical programming approach with the application of the atomic targeting approach."
3,Sludge valorization and challenges,"2.2 Sludge valorization and challenges Sludge valorisation is a process of reuse, recycling, and converting residues into more useful and valuable products. amongst the valorisation technologies present in the industries, anaerobic digestion is undoubtedly the most well-known and effective technology to recover the potential renewable resources by subjecting them to proper waste treatment (Carmona-Cabello et al., 2018). In recent years, the exploitation of anaerobic digestion intermediate, particularly VFA that are produced during the acidogenesis stage has received considerable interest in the context of the circular economy. VFAs serve as the paramount precursors in various biorefinery processes, including polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) (Perez-Zabaleta et al., 2021). PHAs are biopolymers that can be synthesised naturally through the bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates or lipids for bioplastic production. Extensive research has been conducted in investigating the utilisation of industrial wastes as the potential feedstocks for microbial fermentation and PHA production, providing that the high cost of pure carbon sources becomes a limiting factor for industrial applications (Perez-Zabaleta et al., 2021). The examples of studied food processing and daily industrial wastes for PHA production include cheese whey hydrolysate (Kucera et al., 2018), paper mill wastewater (Bengtsson et al., 2008), rice mill effluent (Sabapathy et al., 2018), etc. Generally, the PHA production can be separated into three independent phases, which are acidogenic fermentation of biomass to VFA, enrichment of PHA-accumulating microbes, and lastly accumulation of PHA (Kourmentza et al., 2017). Several advantages have been reported for valorising the wastewater sludge in bioplastic production processes, such as reduction in PHA production cost and decrease in the volume of the discarded wastewater sludge due to PHA extraction step. In the comparison of the traditional PHA production that focuses on the pure-culture system, the PHA synthesis using wastewater sludge as the carbon sources removes the necessity of sterilisation step, which entails high energy requirement that contributes to high PHA production costs (Valentino et al., 2019). The wastewater sludge can be readily converted into VFAs through the acidogenic fermentation stage, whereby the methanogenic step is inhibited during the anaerobic fermentation process. Since numerous bacteria can be found naturally in the wastewater sludge, it can be utilised as a PHAs-accumulating bacteria source to potentially maximise the production of PHA. Besides, the wastewater sludge can also feasibly used as a raw material for bioethanol production (Mannina et al., 2020). Bioethanol is an alcohol that can be obtained from waste lignocellulose material by undergoing microbial fermentation and it can be used in place of conventional transportation fuels (Mannina et al., 2020). Alkasrawi et al. proposed a novel technique known as simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) for bioethanol production from paper mill wastewater (Alkasrawi et al., 2021). The overall performance of SSF indicated that it is promising for scale-up production. Aside from the paper mill wastewater, the alternative low-value feedstocks that are feasible for bioethanol production include dairy industry effluent, thanks to their nutrient-rich nature (Liu et al., 2016). The ethylene derived from renewable ethanol production can also react with the recovered and purified acetic acid from fermented wastewater sludge to generate vinyl acetate monomer (VAM), which is used for the production of polyvinyl acetate and other commodity products (Jones et al., 2015). Notwithstanding the promising performance of valorising wastewater sludge as an alternative carbon source to synthesis bioplastic, the current development of waste-derived PHA synthesis process still at pilot-scale studies. Researchers addressed that the wide commercialisation and industrialisation of waste-derived PHA production emerges to be exceedingly challenging in real life for several reasons (Liu et al., 2016). From the global market perspective, the demand for bioplastic is still considerably restrained owing to its relatively higher market price than that of petrochemical-based polymers, rendering the bioplastic to be less competitive in the global market. The difference in bioplastic market price and conventional plastic is because of the exorbitant PHAs production technology and the stable petroleum price due to abundant shale gas in the world. The other key barriers that hinder the development of the PHA synthesis process on a larger industrial scale include high investment cost, inferior thermal-mechanical properties, and unreliable product quality (Tan et al., 2021). PHA synthesis technology is an expensive industry with a complicated process structure yet low production efficiency. As the fermentation processes are mostly discontinuous, it would take several weeks to complete from inoculum fermentation to downstream PHA purification. The low yield of PHA contributes to high downstream separation and purification costs, rendering higher operating expenditure due to the great consumption of precious freshwater and energy (Wang et al., 2014). Besides, while PHAs possess physicochemical properties that are comparable to conventional petroleum-based plastics, it is reported that they are relatively brittle, less elastic, and have poorer thermal properties, which are not favourable for processing them into sturdy products (Singh et al., 2015). The dilute nature owing to moderate or low concentration of carbon source also compromises the PHA productivity when selecting waste streams as the feedstocks (Ienczak et al., 2013). While the introduction of cheap raw materials may potentially solve the expensive raw material issue that covered more than 40% of the total production cost, the poor conversion of raw materials into desired PHAs contributes towards the termination of PHA commercialisation projects (Bhatia et al., 2021). The next drawback is the inconsistent properties of the PHA biopolymers obtained due to the diversity of the microorganisms present in the wastewater sludge (Khatami et al., 2021). From the abovementioned literature facts, it is comprehensible that the utilisation of wastewater sludge in the current PHA synthesis process poses considerable dilemmas. The high investment cost is indisputably the major obstacle to achieve a greater scale-up of waste-derived bioplastic production. However, economists forecasted that the bioplastic market size will reach USD 121 million by 2025 as driven by the focus of the government on green procurement policies and the impact from COVID-19 that enhance the global plastic demand (Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) 2021). The market growth of bioplastic in the not-so-distant future motivates the process optimisation study to reduce the overpriced investment cost and establish a more prospective production scheme. One of the proposed solutions to enhance the implementation of waste-derived PHA production is by integrating it into existing processes (Koller and Braunegg, 2015). For instance, the process integration into the wastewater treatment system to utilise the pre-existing anaerobic fermenter (Valentino et al., 2017). This strategy might effectively help in achieving a reduction in capital investment and eliminate the land footprint required for the installation of an anaerobic fermenter in the bioplastic production processes. However, these literatures implemented the idea of process integration into a single process without analysing the exchange of material resources from other potential industrial plants or firms that would contribute to the creation of a greater circular economy. Hence, this paper tends to explore further reduction in production costs by establishing benchmarks to potentially minimise the consumption of external resources and discharge of wastes with the development of industrial symbiosis."
4,Methodology,
5,Case study,"3.1 Case study Valorisation of wastewater sludge for the PHA synthesis process has been a revolutionary strategy to provide waste treatment and obtain wealth from waste concurrently. Nonetheless, the development of commercialisation and industrialisation of waste-derived PHA synthesis processes are still at a bottleneck despite extensive research in pilot-scale studies such as simulating the integration of the PHA synthesis process into the existing WWTPs (Gherghel et al., 2019). The limited economic evaluation and efficient material recovery strategies from wastewater sludge are reported to be the causes for hindering the progression of the industrial-scale development of waste-derived PHA synthesis processes (Crutchik et al., 2020). A proposed case study is presented in this paper to conceptualise the problem stated, which may be delivered as follows. Consider an EIP that consists of multiple industrial plants located in proximity. The plants utilise acetic acid, i.e. a type of VFA as the feedstocks for their respective biochemical processes by integrating into an existing paper mill WWTP (Haile et al., 2021). The WWTP treats the paper mill wastewater and industrial wastewater from other participants that contains unreacted feedstocks and fermentable organic matters via enhanced liquid-solid separation process (primary treatment) and anaerobic fermentation that produces a VFA-enriched stream to sustain the demand of each participating plants. For simplicity, the wastewater involved in the EIP can be categorised into carbohydrate, lipid, and protein fractions. Wastewater produced from paper mill contains high fermentable matter content such as cellulose and it is one of the typical low-cost raw materials suggested by the literature (Haile et al., 2021). Note that the paper mill wastewater is an example to suit the proposed case study, where other potential industrial wastewater sludge may be considered for further research in other papers. Assume that an investor plans to build a PHA synthesis plant, whereby two case scenarios are described in Table 2 . Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 illustrate the difference in the process flow for the base case and proposed case, respectively. Table 3 summarises the basic chemical reactions of the participating plants in the biorefinery EIP, including the PHA synthesis plant. Note that the participating plants presented are examples that can potentially participate in the EIP due to the consumption of VFA, whereby the unreacted VFA and other fermentable organic matters generated from these plants in the form of wastewater sludge can be recycled and benefits itself and other plants need. By applying the CHO framework to the proposed case, a CHOSYN is synthesised, which the superstructure representation of the proposed CHOSYN is illustrated in Fig. 3 by showing the interactions between all the participating plants in terms of material integration. In CHOSYN, the waste streams and by-products generated from the participants are referred to as ‘internal source’, whereas the species required by the participants for their respective production processes are known as ‘demand’. Another attentive feature of CHOSYN is the addition of newly built facilities, termed as ‘interceptors’ that create synergistic opportunities with the participating plants by converting the incoming species from external resources and complement to mass integration of internal sources to satisfy the demands of participants. However, retrofitting the EIP with a set of interceptors incur additional investment cost, hence the identification of the most optimal interceptors design symbolises a predicament that needs to be fathomed and resolved in this paper."
6,Candidate reactions for CHO interception network,"3.2 Candidate reactions for CHO interception network Based on the proposed case study in the problem statement, it can be anticipated that the VFAs will be one of the demanded species in the CHOSYN since all the participants exist required VFAs as the feedstocks or reaction precursors to synthesis their respective products. Assume that the VFAs are entirely acetic acid (CH3COOH), the synthesis methods of acetic acid can be categorised into two sectors, i.e. chemical and fermentative techniques. While the fermentative part refers to the acidogenic fermentation of biowaste, the paper aspires to seek an alternative chemical route to supplement VFAs with the establishment of a CHO interception network. Methanol carbonylation is one of the main acetic acid synthesis processes. The typical homogenous methanol carbonylation with organometallic catalysts and corrosive halide-based cocatalysts is reported to demonstrate high activity and selectivity of acetic acid (Qi et al., 2020). However, it is also outlined that it suffers from a complicated separation process. Ni et al. proposed a green route for direct synthesis of acetic acid through vapour-phase methanol carbonylation process with the halide-free and noble metal-free catalysts, and it is reported that the methanol conversion and acetic acid selectivity can achieve up to 100% and 95% respectively (Ni et al., 2017). Given that the CH-O interception network is governed by a set of chemical reactions to meet the demands of the participants via the transformation of internal sources into value-added products, the methanol must be obtained from the external sources for the methanol carbonylation process as methanol is not present in any stream of the proposed biorefinery EIP. Alternatively, methanol synthesis technology can be invited for installation with the utilisation of lower-end raw materials, e.g. methane from external resources. The current industrial methanol production from methane is normally accomplished via a multi-step syngas route (Latimer et al., 2018). Table 4 summarise the possible chemical reactions that can be related to the conversion of methane to methanol through the syngas route. The literature findings listed in this section can then be evaluated for determining the optimal chemical route in the CHO interception network, which will be further discussed in the later stage."
7,Establishment of assumption,"3.3 Establishment of assumption Several assumptions and limitations for modelling the simulation, constructing the CHOSYN design, and calculating the sustainability assessment indicators are determined as follows: 1 All the plants and facilities in CHOSYN operate at a steady state with 7920 hrs/yr. 2 The organic fractions of sludge characteristic in CHOSYN can be categorised to carbohydrates, proteins, and lipid fractions (Raunkjær et al., 1994). Those possible non-CHO wastewater matter content such as heavy metals are excluded from the modelling calculations. 3 No methane gas is generated during anaerobic fermentation in centralised wastewater treatment systems due to inhibition of methanogenesis (Park et al., 2019). 4 Only acetic acid (CH3COOH) is produced from the anaerobic fermenter in the centralised WWTP in CHOSYN. Hence, the VFA-enriched stream can be assumed to consist of only acetic acid (Cheah et al., 2019). 5 The interceptors are comprised of necessary facilities, e.g. separators, reactors, heat exchangers, pumps, compressors, and mixers that are sufficient to carry out the proposed reaction pathways (M.M. El-Halwagi, 2017). 6 The separation efficiency of streams for centralised WWTP and interceptors is 100%. 7 The conversion of chemical reactants in the interceptors achieves 100% (M.M. El-Halwagi, 2017). 8 All the recycled wastewater sludge generated from participating plants is capable to be utilised after sending for re-treatment for VFA recovery. 9 No chemical species loss due to incidents, e.g. leakage in pipelines and spillage throughout the mass integration in CHOSYN 10 The sludge characteristic in CHOSYN is consistent throughout the operation. 11 The basis for paper mill wastewater, which is referred to as a free ‘feedstock’ for CHOSYN (as the paper mill sends its wastewater for treatment purposes) is described in Table 5(a) (Bengtsson et al., 2008). 12 The decomposition of organic matters during the acidogenesis stage of the anaerobic digestion process only produces acetic acid and CO2. The basic chemistry of the process is explicable using stoichiometric equations proposed by R. Peris Serrano, where the molar ratio of VFA and CO2 generation to per mole of organic matter consumed is shown in Table 5(b) (Serrano, 2010). 13 The external resources available for CHOSYN to purchase are methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), and freshwater. 14 No products are lost due to downstream separation and purification processes. 15 The treated wastewater and secondary sludge generated from the centralised WWTP are not recycled as an internal source. Instead, they are discharged to the environment which is not included in the study of CHOSYN. 16 The depreciation of the asset in CHOSYN is assumed to be 10% of the total capital investment using a 10-year linear scheme with negligible salvage (Farouk et al., 2021). 17 The transportation cost of feedstock for non-CHOSYN plants is $0.02/kg. 18 The feedstock selling price is cheaper by 20% for CHOSYN participants as compared to base prices due to the existence of contract collaboration. 19 The participating plants in CHOSYN follow the stoichiometric information and production capacity as summarised in Table 5(c) ."
8,Creation of flow rate data for internal sources and demands in CHOSYN,"3.4 Creation of flow rate data for internal sources and demands in CHOSYN The flow rate data for internal sources and demands in CHOSYN is determined by calculating the VFA source from the paper mill wastewater based on the information provided in Table 5(a) and Table 5(b), and the details of participating plants in Table 5(c). Table 6(a) and Table 6(b) presents the internal sources and demand flow rate of each participating plant, where the calculation details are summarised in Appendix A.2. These flow rate data will then be incorporated into the atomic targeting algorithm model that will be discussed in the later section."
9,Constructing multi-criteria CHOSYN,"3.5 Constructing multi-criteria CHOSYN In advance of constructing a CHOSYN design, a series of mathematical modelling equations with the incorporation of atomic targeting approach needs to be performed (Al-Fadhli et al., 2020). The addressed modelling problem is computed and solved by using LINGO V13.0, a comprehensive tool designed for developing and solving optimisation modelling problems efficiently. The flowchart representing the CHOSYN model algorithm is delineated in Fig. 4 . The first step is the identification of atomic-level information of internal sources and demands for participating plants, based on the flow rate data provided in Table 6(a) and 6(b). The calculation steps for the identification of atomic flow rates of internal sources and demands are presented by the first two rows of the algorithm flowchart in Fig. 4. The atomic flow rates of internal sources and demands of each participating plant are determined by summing the corresponding flow rates, where W s , i , p and G s , p denote the flow rates of internal sources and demand streams, with the account of C, H, and O atomic coefficients of the species in the streams that denoted α s , β s and γ s respectively. The overall C, H, and O atomic flow rates of the CHOSYN, which are represented by A C , p i n t e r n a l s o u r c e , A H , p i n t e r n a l s o u r c e , and A O , p i n t e r n a l s o u r c e for internal sources and A C , p d e m a n d , A H , p d e m a n d and A O , p d e m a n d for demands are then calculated by combining the atomic flow rates of plants involved in CHOSYN. The subsequent step is to determine the minimum flow rates of C, H, and O atoms required to satisfy the demand of participating plants. The net supply of atoms from the plants is identified based on the difference in atomic flow rates of internal sources and demands. A positive net atomic flow rate of a specific atom implies an atomic surplus, which represents a benchmark for the minimum discharge of the atom. Conversely, a negative value corresponds to a deficit, which indicates the minimum atomic flow rate that needs to receive from external sources. With sufficient atomic-scale information, the atomic balance equations for C, H, and O atoms (presented by the blue block in Fig. 4) are then solved to determine the targets of minimum external resource usage, F s , e or discharge of the species D s , d . By coupling the identified flowrate targets with the flowrate data for the internal sources and demands, an overall stoichiometrically balanced equation for the CHOSYN can be constructed. Next, instead of purchasing the demanded chemical species directly from the external sources, the CHOSYN may invite other plants and establish the facilities (also known as interceptors) for converting the low-end species from external sources into the demanded species for participants. Table 7 summarises the feasible candidate interceptors (I1–I6) sourced from Section 3.2 that can potentially satisfy the demands of participating plants through the reaction pathway synthesis technique (Noureldin and El-Halwagi, 2015). In the reaction pathway synthesis approach, the unknown flow rate variables are first applied for each candidate interceptor based on their stoichiometric equations. The reactions with flow rate variables are then combined and arranged according to their respective species, forming a new overall stoichiometrically balanced equation. By comparing the new overall stoichiometric equation with the previous one, multiple possible solutions for the abovementioned flow rate variables are expected. As a result, there are several possible implementations of the CHOSYN design that fulfil the determined flow rate targets for minimum consumption of external resources and minimum discharge of waste streams. Therefore, it is essential to conduct a preliminary screening to select the most optimal reaction route by accounting for ROI metrics, which will be discussed in the later section."
10,Economic assessment and profitability estimation,3.6 Economic assessment and profitability estimation The methodology for economic assessment and profitability estimation of PHA synthesis plant in the base case and proposed case is described in Appendix A.3.1. The detailed information regarding the economic evaluation for interceptors in CHOSYN is also summarised in Appendix A.3.2.
11,Environmental assessment,"3.7 Environmental assessment 3.7.1 Water footprint analysis Water footprint (WF) is a multidimensional water use indicator that has played a critical role in the fields of sustainability study to measure water consumption which is explicitly linked to human activities (Hogeboom, 2020). The WF incorporates a connotation to the origin of the water, as represented by its blue, green, and grey colour components. The green WF is factored out from the WF assessment of the abovementioned case scenarios as it refers to rainwater consumption that is specifically relevant for agricultural and forestry products. The blue WF refers to the consumption of surface water or groundwater for the production of a good, i.e. PHA in this case. The grey WF represents the amount of water required to assimilate pollutants associated with a particular process to meet the effluent discharge standards. Both WF is assessed by scrutinising the water and chemical oxygen demand (COD) mass balance within the PHA processes, where COD is derived from the aforesaid organic matter fractions. The entire WF analysis for the proposed case study can be simplified by evaluating the water usage in the PHA three-step production stages, i.e. acidogenic sludge fermentation, enrichment of biomass with PHAs-storing bacteria, and PHAs accumulation. In the proposed WF analysis model, the PHAs-storing bacteria and accumulation reactors are regarded as a single operation unit. Likewise, the VFAs dilution and gravity centrifugation are treated as single water using operation, where the preponderance of wastewater in the PHA synthesis process is discharged from the gravity centrifugation stage. Hence, the downstream processes which consist of alkaline treatment and multiple centrifugal separations can be excluded from the comparative WF assessment as the water consumption and discharged from these downstream processes are less significant as compared to the upstream processes. The blue WF is determined based on the total amount of water consumed by the PHA three-step production stages. For grey WF, it is calculated by referring to Eq. (1), accounting for the discharge standard of 50 gCOD/L set by the Department of Environment Malaysia (Doe.gov.my 2021). (1) G r e y W F = L C − C l i m where L represents the volumetric flow rate of wastewater generated from the process. C and C l i m are the concentration of wastewater produced and the water-quality standard respectively. Both results of WFs are presented on a basis of 1 tonne of PHA produced. 3.7.2 Carbon footprint analysis Carbon footprint (CF) refers to a direct or indirect emission of GHG during the life cycle of an activity that contributes to global warming. The unit of GHG emission quantities is standardised by converting them into carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-eq) for CF assessment. The assessment of CF analysis for the abovementioned case scenarios is confined to the process boundary of PHA production, i.e. from the reception of wastewater sludge to the production of PHA products. In the PHA synthesis process, two sources of GHG emission need to be highlighted, i.e. anaerobic fermentation process and conversion of VFAs to PHAs. For anaerobic fermentation, the amount of CO2 generated is identified based on information stated in Table 5(b) and assumed that no methane is produced due to the inhibition of the methanogenesis stage during the anaerobic fermentation process. The generation of CO2 during the conversion of VFAs to PHAs is determined by referring to the stoichiometric equation as outlined in Table 3. Since CO2 is the only GHG in the entire PHA synthesis process, the calculation for CF can thus be simplified into Eq. (2). (2) C F = ∑ i C O 2 , i where i corresponds to the process stage which contributes to CO2 emission. Likewise, the result of CF is presented on a basis of per tonne of PHA produced."

14,Benchmarking for minimising resources and waste discharged in CHOSYN,"4.1 Benchmarking for minimising resources and waste discharged in CHOSYN Table 8(a) presents the net flow rate of chemical species involved in the proposed CHOSYN as outlined in Section 3.1 based on the flow rate data of internal sources and demands of participating plants tabulated in Table 6(a) and Table 6(b) with the account of the 128.81 kmol/h of VFAs-enriched stream and 119.62 kmol/h of CO2 contributed by the fermentation of paper mill wastewater sludge in WWTP (calculation provided in Appendix, Table A.3). The net flow rate data of chemical species presented in Table 8(a) indicates a vast generation of waste that consists of CO2 and wastewater sludge from participating plants. Notice that direct discharge of these wastes into the environment is strictly prohibited by regulations, hence a proper waste recycling scheme is important to minimise their environmental impacts such as global warming and eutrophication. At the same time, the participating plants also demand 267.78 kmol/h of supplementary VFA and 268.38 kmol/h of H2 from the interception network to complete their respective production requirements. As mentioned in Section 3.1, the establishment of benchmarks for external resources and waste discharge is vital to enhancing the cyclicity of the symbiotic network by maximising the use of internal sources generated from the unity of biorefineries plants. For the proposed case in this work, the result of simulation suggests that C and H atoms are deficient in the system network, hence the supplementary atoms must be obtained from the external resources to sustain the demands of participants. Hence, the benchmarks for external resources purchased and waste discharged must be developed to minimise the operating cost and environmental impact from CHOSYN. Table 8(b) presents the flow rate targets for external resources and waste discharged that need to be applied in CHOSYN based on the result of the simulation. The benchmarking result suggests that the emission of CO2 from the CHOSYN can be significantly minimised from 217.88 kmol/h to 113.57 kmol/h by capturing and recycling a portion of CO2 gases for the synthesis of demanded species. Given that both CO2 and CO are comprised of C and O atoms, the recovery of CO2 eliminates the necessity for outsourcing the CO. Nonetheless, the CHOSYN still needs to purchase a minimum of 238.50 kmol/h of methane and 134.19 kmol/h of freshwater to fulfil the demands of participating plants due to shortage of C and H atoms in the network system."
15,Conceptual designs of CHOSYN,"4.2 Conceptual designs of CHOSYN The conceptualisation of various CHOSYN designs is accomplished by implementing different solutions during the construction of the overall stoichiometric equation as discussed in Section 3.5. Different solutions are derived from the proposed candidate reactions, or also termed as interceptors in CHOSYN presented in Table 7. Table 9 summarises the possible reaction routes based on the reaction pathway synthesis technique from the LINGO modelling result by referring to the list of candidate reactions (I1–I6) from Table 7 for the generation of demanded species by participating plants in CHOSYN. The calculated flow rate through each interceptor determines the size of facilities that need to be constructed, which can be used to identify the estimated cost for the CHO interception network with the inclusion of economic data at the later stage. Several conceptual designs of CHOSYN are developed based on reaction pathway routes as shown in Table 9, which are illustrated from Fig. 5(a) , 5(b) , 5(c) to Fig. 5(d) . The ‘sludge’ denotes the wastewater sludge with unreacted feedstock and fermentable organic matters, and its flow rate refers to the recyclable VFAs can be contributed to the network. Note that the centralised WWTP also handles paper mill wastewater through anaerobic fermentation, which also contributed 119.62 kmol/h of CO2 and 128.31 kmol/h of VFAs-enriched stream to the network (not shown in the below figures for clarity purpose). All the constructed CHOSYN designs meet the pre-determined flow rate targets for external resources and waste discharged presented in Table 8(b)."
16,Comparison of profitability amongst multiple C-H-O interception networks,"4.3 Comparison of profitability amongst multiple C-H-O interception networks Table 10 displays the result of cost estimation and profitability analysis for different CHO interception networks based on the methodology proposed in Section 3.6. The simulation for cost estimation and profitability analysis is conducted using LINGO. From Table 10, it is noticeable that Route A demonstrates the highest profitability amongst all conceptual designs of CHOSYN by indicating the highest ROI of 15.55%. The outcome of the comparative study is attributed to its low TCI and OPEX of $132.08 million and $25.52 million per year respectively, associated with its pleased ANP return of $20.54 million per year. Besides, Route C also exhibits profitability that is nearly on par with Route A with a recorded ROI of 15.44%. On the other hand, Route D manifests the poorest profitability with an ROI of 10.13%, which is 5.42% lower as compared to Route A. Based on the performance of ROI metrics, it is conclusive that Route A is the most economically favourable to be implemented amongst all conceived conceptual designs. The upshot of the comparative study implies that the methane steam reforming with CO and water gas shift reaction provide the cheapest reaction route to synthesis VFA under the aid of methanol synthesis from syngas and methanol carbonylation to acetic acid reactions. Hence, the installation of the CHO interception network through Route A is selected for the formation of CHOSYN in the proposed case."
17,Evaluation of comparative study between base case and proposed case,"4.4 Evaluation of comparative study between base case and proposed case 4.4.1 Changes in annual production capacity of PHA synthesis process Fig. 6 depicts the changes in annual production capacity of the PHA synthesis plant before and after joining the CHOSYN on a basis of 3 t/hr of paper mill wastewater as feedstock. Since the participation in CHOSYN allows the effluent generated from the PHA production process to be treated in the centralised WWTP and recycled back to the plant, the amount of VFAs present in the process of the proposed case for PHA conversion is marginally higher than that of the base case. As a result, the productivity of the PHA synthesis process in the proposed case is maximised with a productivity growth of 7.94% under the waste recycling scheme. The result from Fig. 6 also presents the importance of waste restitution through recycling the process effluent, provided that the yield of PHA from VFA is considerably low as shown in Table 5(c). 4.4.2 Waste treatment and feedstock logistic problems In a profound view, the process and material integration also potentially solve the logistic problems of wastewater sludge for the PHA synthesis process. In the base case, the transportation of wastewater sludge is troublesome in a technical manner, especially when the PHA synthesis plant is situated nowhere near the source of feedstock. As discussed in Section 2.2, one of the major issues of selecting wastewater sludge as an alternative feedstock is its dilute nature in terms of fermentable organic matters as compared to expensive pure cultures. Hence, the PHA synthesis plant requires to source a vast amount of wastewater sludge to achieve a reasonably high industrial-scale production rate. However, the transportation of this large volume of wastewater for feedstock usage in a PHA production plant can be a fairly high cost as highlighted by Valentino et al. (Valentino et al., 2017). Besides, the integration of PHA synthesis processes with biological wastewater treatment infrastructure in WWTP emerges as a viable solution to minimise the waste treatment costs significantly. In CHOYSN, it is assumed that the centralised WWTP treats the wastewater from the participants without charges due to the existence of business correlation, as the fermented wastewater can then be sold to the participants in the form of VFAs-enriched stream. The process integration into the existing WWTP allows the material exchange via pipelines to be feasible, provided that these plants are situated in proximity. Hence, the integration strategy allows the implementation of a waste recycling scheme by collaborating with the WWTP, which subsequently saving the operating cost for wastewater treatment and reducing the environmental impact of the PHA synthesis process due to the discharge of nutrient-rich wastewater sludge that may potentially cause eutrophication. Table 11 summarises the cost-savings that can be achieved from the integration scheme in the proposed case. From the results presented in Table 11, it is evident that the integration strategy in CHOSYN is capable to reduce the OPEX up to 13.54% of the proposed case, leading to annual cost-savings of $7.40 million. The result agrees with the expectation and justification mentioned earlier, where process and material integration are viable to resolve the sludge handling and logistic problems effectively from an economic and technical perspective. 4.4.3 Results of economic assessment and profitability analysis From the discussion in Section 2.2, it is highlighted that the conventional waste-derived PHA synthesis processes experience high capital and operating cost issues albeit the introduction of the inexpensive substrate as an alternative to carbon sources. The statement provides a certain agreement with the findings from this paper, where it is demonstrated by Fig. 7(a) that the conventional PHA production process presented in base case incurs exorbitant TCI of $269.44 million under an annual production capacity of 19,887 t PHA/hr. Conversely, the proposed case engenders a splendid reduction in TCI from $269.44 million to $163.28 million, which corresponds to a capital cost-saving of 39.40%. Fig. 7(b) presents the estimated equipment purchased cost for each stage involved in the PHA synthesis process for both the base case and the proposed case. From Fig. 7(b), it is unveiled that the anaerobic fermentation process is the most expensive process stage in the entire PHA production line, which accounts for nearly half of the total equipment purchase cost. In the proposed case, the amalgamation of the anaerobic fermentation process for both PHA production and wastewater treatment processes eliminates the necessity of investing the fermenter in the production plant and this approach becomes the prime contributor to the notable reduction in TCI. Besides, the result from Fig. 7(a) also indicates that the proposed case is capable to minimise the operating expenditure of the PHA synthesis, where the OPEX moderately reduces from $65.51 million to $54.65 million per annum. Aside from the cost-savings from waste-treatment and feedstock transportation as discussed in the previous section, the reduction in OPEX is also contributed by the difference in feedstock expenditure from both cases, which is summarised in Table 12 extracted from Appendix A.5 Table A.8. Since the base case purchases unfermented wastewater sludge instead of VFA-enriched stream from the WWTP, it is expected that the amount of feedstock purchased from the base case is significantly higher than that of the proposed case as the organic matter contents in unfermented wastewater is dilute. As a result, the total feedstock expenditure in the base case ends up higher than that of the integrated process despite the prices of unfermented paper mill wastewater is relatively lower as compared to the VFAs-enriched stream based on the information given in Appendix A.4(b). The waste recycling approach discussed in Section 4.4.2 plays a significant role in stimulating revenue growth since the proposed case exhibits a higher annual production capacity than that of the base case. In addition to the lower OPEX in the proposed case, it is reported that the ANP of the PHA synthesis process increases from $17.14 million to $27.64 million after joining the CHOSYN. In short, the implementation of process integration and material integration into WWTP in the CHOSYN emerges to be a prospective way to optimise the conventional PHA synthesis process scheme presented by the base case. The statement is supported by the magnificent ROI growth from 6.36% to 16.93% as displayed in Fig. 7(a). Therefore, it can be deduced that the development of CHOSYN drives the circularity and economic sustainability of the waste-derived bioplastic production process markedly. 4.4.4 Results of environmental assessment based on water and carbon footprints The result of the WF and CF assessment for the PHA synthesis process before and after joining the CHOSYN is presented in Fig. 8 . Note that the WF and CF in this section are confined to the process boundary of the PHA synthesis plant. The water mass balance diagrams are illustrated in Appendix A.6 for reference. The calculation steps for determining CF are presented in Appendix A.7. It is highlighted that the blue water consumption for the PHA synthesis process can be marginally diminished by 3.69 m3/t PHA after integrating the process into the existing WWTP, owing to lower dilution water consumption during the PHA dilution stage. Besides, a striking reduction of 19.72 m3/t PHA of grey WF can be attained in the proposed case. As the grey WF is an indicator of freshwater pollution, it implies that the conventional PHA synthesis process in the base case induces significant environmental concern due to its high grey WF. The discharge of these nutrient-rich effluents may arise environmental issues such as eutrophication and algae bloom. On the other side, the effluent treatment to meet the local water-quality standard incurs an annual operating cost of $2.46 million based on the data provided in Table 11. Hence, it can be deduced that the proposed case optimises the water consumption of the bioplastic synthesis process with lower blue WF and zero grey WF by sending the wastewater to the centralised WWTP for recycling purposes. While the release of CO2 from the bioplastic production process may be technically considered as carbon-neutral, i.e. net-zero CO2 emissions due to utilisation of bio-based material, scientists argued that a very long time scales is required for the carbon to be sequestered by natural forests (Hetemäki, 2019). Therefore, the impact of CO2 released from the PHA synthesis processes is significant despite its carbon-neutral property under the climate-carbon cycle feedback scheme. The result of CF analysis from Fig. 8 implies that the process integration can strategically mitigate the greenhouse impact by reducing the 3.12 t CO2-eq/t PHA of CF. The zero CF in the proposed case is because the CO2 generated from the PHA synthesis process is sent to CHOSYN as an internal source instead of releasing it to the atmosphere. Hence, it can be deduced that the proposed case is more climate-friendlier than that of the base case. The outcome from sustainability assessment manifests the under-performance of the conventional waste-derived bioplastic production process presented by the base case, which also elucidates the dilemma of commercialising it to a real industrial scale. The result also reflects the importance of process and material integration in attenuating the effect of climate change and freshwater depletion derived from the biorefinery process."
18,Sensitivity analysis,"4.5 Sensitivity analysis 4.5.1 Effect of variation in VFA price on ROI of PHA synthesis plant Since several assumptions are applied when deducing the price of feedstock in the CHOSYN, it is desired to determine the effect of the VFA-enriched stream cost parameter on the profitability of the optimised PHA synthesis process model. The effect of altering the VFAs-enriched stream is presented in Fig. 9 . From the sensitivity analysis plot in Fig. 9, it is demonstrated that the ROI of the PHA synthesis plant decreases linearly with the increase of VFAs-enriched stream price. It is because the OPEX turns up higher due to greater expenditure for purchasing the feedstocks. In a scenario where the VFAs-enriched stream price increases by 20%, the ROI of the bioplastic production plant reduces marginally by 1.84%. The phenomenon of low profitability variation can be explained by the cheap selling price of feedstocks in CHOSYN due to the existence of contract collaboration, and this presents the advantage of participating in CHOSYN whereby promising profitability growth can be preserved through the material and process integration. 4.5.2 Effect of variation in PHA production capacity on CO2 discharge from CHOSYN The second sensitivity analysis is related to the environmental issue of implementing CHOSYN, i.e. the overall GHG emission from the biorefinery EIP. As presented in Table 8(b), the targeted minimum CO2 discharge from the CHOSYN is determined to be 113.57 kmol CO2/h, which also implies that 39,576.87 t CO2 will be released per annum. Based on the optimal CHOSYN design selected (Route A), four CO2 sources are identified, which are PHA and VAM synthesis processes, anaerobic fermentation in WWTP, and water gas shift reaction in the CHO interception network. Fig. 10 presents the outcome of sensitivity analysis by changing the PHA production capacity of the proposed case. At initial thought, it is expected that the increase in PHA production capacity would result in an escalation of CO2 emission rate from CHOSYN concurrently, provided that the increasing PHA production capacity generates and integrates more CO2 into the interception network. However, the result sensitivity analysis exhibits an intriguing trend, whereby the CO2 emission from CHOSYN reduces as the production capacity of the PHA synthesis plant increases. Note that the increase in bioplastic production capacity also causes higher demand for VFA-enriched streams. Besides the fermentation in WWTP, the methanol carbonylation process plays a critical role in supplementing VFA to the CHOSYN. It also acts as a carbon sink, whereby it collects the CO2 from the internal sources and converts it to the desired VFA. In consequence, more CO2 is recycled within the CHOSYN and chemically valorised instead of releasing it to the atmosphere as waste. The result highlights that a large industrial-scale bioplastic production plant would be more preferred to join the CHOSYN as the net carbon emission of CHOSYN can be significantly minimised and enables a more environmentally sustainable biorefinery process."
19,Implication,"The major contribution of this paper is the identification of potential material and process integration schemes that would significantly reduce the production cost required for the waste-derived bioplastic production process. As the current research of waste-derived synthesis process is restricted to the pilot scale with the high investment costs and poor material recovery serve as the key barriers that hinder the development of the PHA synthesis process on a larger industrial scale, the paper suggests an alternative pathway by applying industrial ecology and circular economy concepts to enhance the sustainability of the bioplastic industry by cooperating with other biorefinery plants that result in the formation of a promising industrial symbiosis. The optimised CHOSYN model associated with the atomic targeting approach presented in this paper can assist engineers and researchers to develop vital benchmarks for minimising the consumption of external resources and waste discarded into the environment during the design phase of the symbiosis network. The strategic sludge management approach for the integrated bioplastic production process is also one of the key contributions of this paper to enhance the economic viability of the project as well as reduce its environmental impacts such as eutrophication and algae bloom. By catalysing the commercialisation of the waste-derived PHA production process, the paper also aspires to mitigate the modern-day plastic pollution issue to foster the replacement of petroleum-based plastic. Based on the presented theoretical results, the implementation of CHOSYN could significantly elevate the production capacity of the bioplastic industry under a more cost-effective process design scheme. By overcoming the limitations of commercial PHA production from waste streams, it would probably attract a greater interest of investors in promoting the bioplastic industry and stimulate the global bioplastic market. The outcome would ultimately accelerate the transition of petroleum-based with bioplastics and alleviate the non-recyclable plastic pollution issue. One of the distinctive properties in the proposed CHOSYN is the addition of the interceptors to convert the incoming species from external resources for satisfying the demands of all participants. Based on the economic analysis conducted in the paper, the investment in retrofitting the EIP by introducing essential interceptors emerges to be economically viable, with an ROI of 15.55%. Hence, besides the benefits of the discounted feedstock prices, the participating plants can tend to collaborate by sharing the constructing costs required for retrofitting the EIP and obtaining the profit earned based on the invested amount. Thus, it is anticipated that the implementation of the proposed CHOSYN can also potentially promote the regional biochemical industrial development as shown in the presented case study. A reduction in environmental impact generated can be expected from the synergistic biorefinery EIP creation where the carbon footprint is considerably reduced."
20,Conclusion,"An optimisation study for the waste-derived PHA synthesis process with the employment of the CHO framework has been presented. The study mainly focuses on interplant mass and process integration to enhance the economic and environmental sustainability of the PHA production process. A case study that involves isolated conventional and proposed integrated bioplastic production processes is designed in this paper. The atomic targeting approach is utilised to solve the perplexing problem of stream allocation and benchmarks establishment for a given set of internal sources and demands flow rate data in the CHOSYN. The reaction synthesis pathway technique along with the incorporation of economic data is also used to identify the optimal CHOSYN design. In general, substantial growth in profitability and reduction in environmental impact is observed from the proposed case. Sensitivity analyses with respect to the price of the VFA-enriched stream and the production capacity of the PHA plant are also conducted. The optimal results obtained from this paper could guide the plant engineers to achieve sustainability targets by incorporating the industrial symbiosis principle in the bioplastic production and it is aspired to foster the hindered development of the waste-derived PHA synthesis process in the future. There are several limitations in this study that need to be addressed. First, the proposed CHO framework will no longer be applicable in the case where protein fraction in the fermentable wastewater sludge characterisation is significant due to the presence of N atom in the amino group (-NH2) of protein molecules. Hence, it is recommended to extend the current CHO framework to the carbon-hydrogen-oxygen-nitrogen (CHON) scheme if the feedstock used contains high protein. Second, notwithstanding the spectacular economic and environmental sustainability improvement attained from creating the CHOSYN, the global warming impact from the CHOSYN emerges to be significant owing to high CO2 emission. Therefore, it is crucial to seek carbon sequestration and valorisation alternatives that can help to mitigate the global warming effect of CHOSYN and if possible, realise a zero net-carbon emission EIP. Further studies should consider creating the CHON framework in solving optimisation problem for the biochemical process that involves feedstock with significant N atoms and assessing the applicability of the framework."
