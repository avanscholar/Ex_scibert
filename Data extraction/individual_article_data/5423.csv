0,Introduction,
1,Background,"1.1 Background Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) have many advantages. PEMFCs deliver a high power density-power generated per unit of weight, volume, or area-leading to compact size and lightweight. Because of the thermal properties of the electrolyte-perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) polymer-PEMFCs operate at low temperatures typically at about 60–80 °C—allowing them to warm up quickly, the start-up quickly and respond to load changes rapidly [1]."
2,Modern day energy crisis,"1.2 Modern day energy crisis As technology grew and modernization begins, the crisis of energy become out of control. The population of the word is expected to reach 9.6 billion by the year 2050 [2,3], as a result majority of the whom may lead a poverty life, if we fail to alter the energy resources our current way of developing industrial development, economic growth and lifestyle of the word depend upon the Oil and gas energy. The economic food production by industrial agriculture needs more natural gas and oil resources like fertilizers, pesticides, machinery plants, harvesting, cultivation, food processing, packaging, transportation, and marketing. Easy and cheap availability of this kind of energy has been made major changes in the world industrial civilization in the last century possible, including its huge impact on indigenous cultures and planetary ecosystems [4]. As the high living standards begin this is reflected in the enhanced consumption of fossil fuels. The dramatic increase in the utilization of non-renewable energy sources across the globe leading to the energy crisis. Presently, the need for a clean and renewable energy requirement is needy across the globe. The fossil fuels are about to end and are dwindling because of damaging nature to the environment and high cost. There is a necessity for cheaper and easily available energy resource is greatly needed. An efficient and much feasible alternative technique is fuel cells. It is a renewable energy resource, portable and eco-friendly there is an urgent and considered as a future energy resource. Fuel cells can be considered as extremely practical as an alternative to the carbon-intensive energy source. A fuel cell is a device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy using hydrogen and oxygen. Amongst different types of fuel cells, polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) are an easier and efficient process which converts hydrogen into electric energy. Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells are considered the best competitive technology to replace the traditional energy generators because of its prominent nature having zero-emission, quick start-up, and high efficiency. This technology attracted much attention in the area of portable and automotive utilities [5], distributed power generation [6,7], and integrated heat and power system [8]. In general, the performance of PEMFC is highly affected by the operating parameters such as pressure, temperature, gas flow rate, and load charges. Several complex mechanism and phenomenon are involved during the dynamic operation of the PEMFC like byproduct water flooding into the system, and scarcity of air in the system those are closely related to heat, water, and gas management [9–13]. During PEMFC operation polymeric membrane is one of the crucial parts. Several key parameters are considered when considering the fuel cell electrolyte. The most required properties include high proton conduction, high thermal, chemical stability, and lower gas permeability [14,15]. The present research work focuses on the development of new generation polymeric membrane and its evaluation of fuel cell applications. The polymer electrolyte membranes (PEM) are very important parts of many electrochemical instruments. In polymer electrolyte membranes fuel cells, the membranes allow the permeation of protons through them from anode to cathode direction by preventing anode to cathode electronic direction contact [16,17]."
3,Experimental,
4,Materials,"2.1 Materials Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (99 % hydrolyzed with a molecular weight of 1,25,000 g mol−1), HCl, sulphuric acid were procured from s. d fine chemicals, India limited. Acrylamide (AAm) with purity ≥ 99% (HPLC grade) and Benzoyl peroxide was supplied by Sigma Aldrich Chemical Co. Double distilled water was used throughout the experiment."
5,Synthesis of copolymer,2.2 Synthesis of copolymer The copolymer synthesis reaction was carried out in an aqueous solution. The same proportional ratio of PVA and AAm and benzoyl peroxide as initiator were used for all three reactions to prepare the membrane in this reaction 5 g of PVA was dissolved in water at 60 °C. An adequate amount of acrylamide (1 g) and initiator (0.4 wt% to comonomer) were introduced to the reaction vessel under continuous stirring. The temperature was maintained at 80 °C for 6 h to complete the reaction so that the free radicals have to generate from the initiator and initiation reaction to begin. The obtained reaction mixture was precipitated in methanol and filtered under vacuum. The obtained product was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h.
6,Heteropolyacid (H3PW12O40) embedded copolymeric membrane fabrication and crosslinking,"2.3 Heteropolyacid (H3PW12O40) embedded copolymeric membrane fabrication and crosslinking The synthesized PVA-g-AAm copolymer was dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water under constant stirring of 300 rpm by maintaining the temperature 60 °C. Once the viscous slurry was obtained different gravimetric ratio of H3PW12O40 (i.e. 1, 2.5, and 5 wt% w.r.t total copolymeric weight) were added as filler under continuous stirring in the reaction vessel. The mixture was stirred for 5 h. Once the homogeneous viscous slurry was obtained, the product was allowed to cool at till it attains room temperature. After attaining room temperature the solution was cast onto a neat and clean glass plate with the help of doctor’s blade. The casted solution was allowed to dry under dust-free atmosphere. Once the solution was dried membrane was peeled off from the glass plate and stored properly. Further, the membranes were crosslinked with glutaraldehyde by soaking them in a crosslinking bath containing 5 mL of glutaraldehyde, 25 mL of water, and 2–3 drops of HCl as the catalyst. The modified membranes were sulfonated by soaking in the 4 N sulphuric acid solvent bath for 6 h and dried. Beyond 5 wt% loading of H3PW12O40 resulted in leaching out of the filler moiety from the membrane hence it is restricted only for 5 wt% loading of H3PW12O40."
7,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization Attenuated total reflection Fourier infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra was recorded on a Nicolet IS 10 MX infrared spectrophotometer with a cool mercury-cadmium telluride detector (MCT). The internal reflection element was a germanium crystal and 25 average scans were for individual spectrum at a resolution of 5 cm−1 was taken. SEM images of the pristine PVA-g-AAm and H3PW12O40 loaded PVA-g-AAm composite membranes containing 2.5 wt% and 5 wt% of H3PW12O40 embedded PVA-g-AAm membranes were selected to study the membrane surface morphology. Membranes were sputtered with the gold coating to make them conducting and placed on a copper stub. Scanning was done using JEOL model JSM-840A, Japan. The thickness of the gold layer accomplished by gold sputtering was done at approximately 20 nm."
8,Ion exchange capacity (IEC),"2.5 Ion exchange capacity (IEC) Ion exchange capacity of the membrane was estimated through acid–base titration. In order to estimate the effect of crosslinking, ion exchange capacity (IEC) of the polymer was estimated. IEC indicates the number of functional groups present before and after crosslinking. This gives an idea of the extent of crosslinking. In reality, IEC indicates the number of milliequivalents of ions in 1 g of dry polymer. The ion exchange capacity was calculated using the formula (1): (1) IEC = B - P × 0.1 × 5 m where B is amount of sulfuric acid used to neutralize the blank sample, P is amount of sulfuric acid used to neutralize the copolymeric membrane, 0.1 is normality of sulfuric acid, number 5 indicates the factor corresponding to the ratio of the amount of NaOH taken to dissolve the copolymer to the amount used for titration and m represents the mass of the sample in gms."
9,Degree of swelling,"2.6 Degree of swelling Water sorption experiments were performed gravimetrically for all prepared copolymers in water containing feed mixture at 30 °C as the standard protocol [18]. The weight of circularly cut (2.5 cm diameter) PVA-g-AAm/H3PW12O40 membranes were taken in a digital microbalance to an accuracy of ±0.01 mg. The samples were placed inside the airtight test bottles containing 30 cm3 of the test media. Test bottles were transferred into an incubator maintaining the temperature at 50 °C. Dry membranes were equilibrated by soaking in different compositions of feed mixtures in a sealed vessel for 24 h. The swollen membranes were weighed immediately after removing and wiped with soft tissue paper. The % degree of swelling was calculated using the formula (2), (2) % D S = W ∞ - W 0 W 0 × 100 where W ω and W 0 are the weights of swollen and dry membranes, respectively. The reason behind this study is during measurement of fuel cell, in the reaction water is obtained as byproduct. In such condition because of excess swelling membrane may tare. This study will give the clear data about the membranes stability in agues atmosphere."
10,Fuel cell measurements,"2.7 Fuel cell measurements The H3PW12O40 loaded PVA-g-AAm were sandwiched in between Toray carbon papers charged with a Pt as a catalyst with the loading of 0.5 mg Pt cm−2 ((10 wt% Pt)/Vulcan ®), ElectroChem SA) at anode and cathode ends. The effective membrane area is 4.8 cm2. PEMFC was operated at 50 °C with a hydrogen flow rate of 150 mL min−1 at 1 kg/cm2 pressure and 300 mL min−1 of air with pressure 1 kg cm2. The relative humidity maintained during the experiments was 75%, 90%, and 100%. The proton conductivity (σ) was obtained using the formula (3), (3) σ = l R × A where ‘σ’ is the proton conductivity measured in terms of S cm−1, ‘l’ is the membrane thickness (distance between electrodes) measured in cm and ‘A’ is the effective membrane area or the surface area required for proton transport across the membrane (or electrode area) and is measured in terms of cm2 and ‘R’ is the resistance of the membrane (W) [19]. Linear sweep voltametry (LS, with scan rate of 5 mV min−1) was used to monitor hydrogen across the system. Hydrogen was fed into anode side chamber of the fuel cell and the cathode serves as a reference electrode. In this arrangement, hydrogen evolves at the anode which is being utilized as a dynamic hydrogen electrode (DHE). On the other hand, nitrogen (2 LN min−1 at ambient pressure) was fed in to anode side chamber of the electrolytic cell, functioning as working electrode. The illustration of fuel cell assembly was shown in Fig. 1 [20]."
11,Results,
12,Fuel cell measurement,"3.1 Fuel cell measurement Synthesized H3PW12O40 loaded PVA-g-AAm copolymeric membranes were tested for fuel cell using Hydrogen and Oxygen. The proton conductivity results have been obtained and plotted. Results are shown for all prepared membranes i.e. plain PVA-g-AAm, 1 wt% H3PW12O40 loaded PVA-g-AAm, 2.5 wt% H3PW12O40 loaded PVA-g-AAm and 5% H3PW12O40 loaded PVA-g-AAm membranes."
13,FTIR,3.2 FTIR The grafting reaction was carried out in aqueous media. The acrylamide in solution form was added to PVA in solution in presence of potassium persulfate at 80 °C. The obtained copolymers were further characterized by FTIR spectroscopy and are plotted in Fig. 2 . The pure PVA Fig. 2(a) and PVA-g-AAm Fig. 2(b) were shown. The peak at 1650 cm−1 corresponds to ν CO amide band 1 group and 1600 cm−1 represents ν 1600 cm−1 amide band 2 group was found in Fig. 2 (b) PVA-g-AAm. This gives clear evidence that the grafting reaction between PVA and AAm took place.
14,SEM studies,"3.3 SEM studies SEM image of the surface of the pristine PVA-g-AAm and 5 wt% H3PW12O40 embedded PVA-g-AAm hybrid membranes as shown in Fig. 3 . Fig. 3(a) shows the SEM surface images of the pristine PVA-g-AAm membrane, and Fig. 3(b) shows 5 wt. % H3PW12O40 embedded PVA-g-AAm hybrid membranes. Observe that H3PW12O40 moieties are distributed uniformly across the surface in the copolymeric membrane matrix."
15,IEC Results,"3.4 IEC Results The ion exchange capacity test was performed for the crosslinked PVA-g-AAm copolymer and compared with the uncrosslinked membrane. The amount of residual hydroxyl and amide groups present before and after crosslinking was estimated from IEC test. The uncrosslinked PVA-g-AAm showed 2.108 meq/g and the crosslinked PVA-g-AAm showed IEC of 0.593 meq/g. The IEC, which is equal to the total number of free hydroxyl and amide groups, has decreased after the crosslinking reaction. The results show that approximately 72% of the hydroxyl and amide groups from the uncrosslinked copolymeric membrane have been involved in the crosslinking reaction with glutaraldehyde. However, there are still some extra hydroxyl and amide groups are present and they allow the diffusion of molecules through a crosslinked copolymeric membrane."
16,Discussion,
17,Fuel cell tests,"4.1 Fuel cell tests The obtained proton conductivity results were plotted in Fig. 4 . Results are shown for all prepared membranes i.e. plain PVA-g-AAm, 1 wt% H3PW12O40 loaded PVA-g-AAm, 2.5 wt% H3PW12O40 loaded PVA-g-AAm and 5% H3PW12O40 loaded PVA-g-AAm membranes. The obtained data have shown that the modified membranes showed better performance as compared to its plain membrane. The plain membrane showed 3.492 × 10−2 S cm−1 for 75% RH to 3.942 × 10−2 S cm−1. Whereas 5 wt% H3PW12O40 loaded Membranes showed 6.315 to 13.333 × 10−2 S cm−1 for 75% to 100% RH. The results showed that the increased proton conductivity as increase in humidity level. Proton conductivity results are well in agreement with IEC results. The plots were shown in Fig. 4. Hydrogen permeability increased with increasing content of H3PW12O40. This suggests that the polar molecules experienced some difficulty while passing through the membrane matrix formed with PVA-g-AAm on the same time the non polar molecules (H2) permeated easily through the same matrix. Permeability data were plotted in Fig. 5 . The comparison plots of PEMFC performance of prepared membranes are shown in Fig. 6 . All the membrane measurement was taken at 75% relative humidity atmosphere. Amongst the prepared membranes, 5 wt% H3PW12O40 loaded copolymer shown best performance."
18,Conclusions,PVA-g-AAm based membranes were prepared and to which H3PW12O40 as filler were embedded. The prepared membranes were characterized for fuel cell applications. Membranes showed good fuel cell results using H2 as fuel. The membranes were characterized by FTIR to confirm grafting reaction and surface morphology were studied using SEM. Amongst the prepared membranes 5 wt% H3PW12O40 incorporated PVA-g-AAm shown good results.
