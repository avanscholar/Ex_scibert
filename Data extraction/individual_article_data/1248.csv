0,Introduction,"α -Alkylation of carbonyl compounds is one of the most fundamental reactions for the synthesis of pharmaceutical-, heterocycle-, and natural-product-directed molecules [1–3]. The traditional methods for α -alkylation of carbonyl compounds need large amounts of bases with organohalides as the alkylating reagents [4–7], consequentially leading to the formation of stoichiometric undesired waste, which makes the traditional methods dissatisfy the requirements of green chemistry. Alcohols are industrially preferred reagents for α -alkylation of carbonyl compounds because they are less toxic, much cheaper, and more readily available than the corresponding organohalides in many cases, and the only byproduct is water in the reaction [8–12]. But the hydroxyl group of an alcohol is difficult to be replaced by a nucleophilic agent, thus limiting the application of alcohols to α -alkylation of carbonyl compounds. Borrowing-hydrogen [13–18] or hydrogen-autotransfer [19–22] method using transition-metal compounds or complexes as the catalysts, first reported by Grigg’s and Watanabe’s groups [23,24], can solve the above problem. In the past few decades, continuous efforts have been made towards α -alkylation of carbonyl compounds with alcohols, and a wide variety of transition-metal catalysts, such as Ru [25–30], Ir [31–37], Pd [38–43], have been employed for such transformations. Even so, these transition-metal-catalyzed reactions still have some problems and shortcomings: (1) The initial alcohol oxidation to generate the aldehyde and the metal hydride species is a thermodynamically unfavourable process; (2) The reactions have to use the transition-metal catalysts, which are rare and expensive, and also need the addition of activating ligands or to be preformed; (3) Transition metals are also toxic, and the metal contamination in pharmaceutical and biochemical products is hard to deal with; And (4) large amounts of hydrogen acceptors or bases are required. Therefore, the development of more efficient, more practical, and much greener synthetic routes for α -alkylation of carbonyl compounds is still an urgent and challenging task. In this context, Hua-Jian Xu et al. recently reported transition-metal-free α -alkylation reactions of ketones with benzylic, aliphatic, allylic, and 2-aminobenzyl alcohols, in which lithium tert-butoxide was employed as the promoter, and the alkylated products with high selectivity were obtained in satisfactory yields [44]. Later on, Qing Xu and co-workers reported particularly fascinating transition-metal-free autocatalyzed α -alkylation reactions of ketones with primary alcohols, which can selectively yield alkylated ketone and alcohol products under different reaction conditions (Fig. 1 )[45]. 100 mol% NaOH, nitrogen, and 3 equivalents of primary alcohol can cause the production of alkylated alcohol products under neat conditions at 130 °C, whereas 100 mol% KOH, air, and 1.2 equivalents of primary alcohol favor the production of alkylated ketone products in toluene at 110 °C. Other transition-metal-free C-alkylation reactions with alcohols as the alkylating reagents were also reported, such as β -alkylation of benzylic secondary alcohols [46], dehydrative β -alkylation of methyl carbinols [47], regioselective C 3 -alkylation of indoles [48], and 9-C-alkylation of fluorenes [49]. The common characteristic of these reactions is that all of them need bases and do not require transition-metal catalysts. The realization of the above transition-metal-free reactions provides an effective and green synthesis method for C-alkylation reactions with alcohols as the alkylating reagents. The further development of the current catalytic systems and the extension of the autocatalyzed α -alkylated methods depend on an accurate understanding of the reaction details. Thus in this paper, we carry out a thorough DFT study on the transition-metal-free selective autocatalyzed α -alkylation reactions of ketones with alcohols developed by Qing Xu and co-workers. The goals of the present study are as follows: (1) to identify the role of the base; (2) to uncover the autocatalyzed α -alkylation mechanism; and (3) to reveal the origins of the selectivity."
1,Methods,"All calculations were performed with the SMD solvation model [50]. As for the reaction leading to alkylated alcohol, benzyl alcohol was chosen as the solvent because 3 equivalents of benzyl alcohol were used and the reaction was under neat condition in the experiment. As for the reaction leading to alkylated ketone, the experimental toluene was employed as the solvent. All the structures were optimized at the B3LYP [51,52]/6-31G(d,p) [53] level. Harmonic frequencies were calculated at 403.15 K for the production of alkylated alcohol and at 383.15 K for the production of alkylated ketone to verify the optimized structures to be minima (zero imaginary frequency) or transition states (only one imaginary frequency), and to provide thermal corrections for Gibbs free energies and enthalpies. IRC (intrinsic reaction coordinate) [54] calculations were conducted to confirm a transition state does connect its forward and backward minima. Single-point energy calculations were carried out on the stationary points at the B2PLYPD3 [55,56]/6-311++G(d,p) level (B2PLYPD3 requests the double hybrid B2PLYP method combined with Grimme’s D3BJ dispersion). Unless otherwise noted, Gibbs free energies, single-point energies corrected by the corresponding Gibbs free energy corrections, are used in the following discussions, and the enthalpy results, single-point energies added by the corresponding enthalpy corrections, are shown in the square brackets of figures and tables for reference. Using the same optimized geometries, we also performed the single-point energy calculations at the mPW2PLYPD [57,58]/6-311++G(2df,2p) and PBE0DH [59]/6-311++G(2df,2p) levels to support the conclusions drawn from B2PLYPD3 results. All calculations were carried out by using Gaussian 16 programs [60]."
2,Results and discussion,"Qing Xu and co-workers have found that the bases NaOH and KOH can efficiently promote the production of alkylated alcohols and ketones under different experimental conditions, respectively, and have proposed autocatalyzed route for α -alkylation of ketones with alcohols (Fig. 2 ) [45]. They postulated stages I, III, and IV all proceeded via Meerwein-Pondorf-Verley-Oppenauer (MPV-O) type redox processes, and gave an explanation for the intriguing selectivity that air can oxidize alkylated alcohols into the corresponding alkylated ketones with the aid of bases. To accurately understand the transformation details, we selected the reactions shown in Fig. 1 as the model reactions in the calculations (R1 = R2 = Ph, and R3 = H for the production of alkylated alcohol; R1 = Ph, R2 = p-MeOC6H4, and R3 = H for the production of alkylated ketone). On the basis of Qing Xu and co-workers’ experimental results, their presumptive reaction route, and our computational results, we found, after the generation of the bis-alkali metal alkoxide mediator M1D (M = Na or K), the transformation for α -alkylation of ketone with alcohol partly or entirely involves the following stages (Fig. 3 ): (I) aldehyde formation via MPV-O alcohol oxidation; (II) M1D-mediated aldol condensation via two substeps consisting of M1D-mediated enolization of the ketone R2 COCH3 (R2 = Ph or p-MeOC6H4), giving the enolization intermediate M4D, and the coupling of M4D with PhCHO, affording the chalcone intermediate M9D; (III) M1D-mediated MPV-O reduction of M9D, generating the alkylated ketone Ket13-M and PhCHO; IV) M1D-mediated MPV-O reduction of Ket13-M, producing the alkylated alcohol Alc16-M and PhCHO; and (V) dioxygen-assisted oxidation of the alkylated alcohol Alc16-K, reproducing the alkylated ketone Ket13-K. Stage I only occurs at the beginning of the reaction. For the production of the alkylated alcohol Alc16-Na, the subsequent transformation for α -alkylation of PhCOCH3 with PhCH2OH is composed of stages II, III, and IV. For the production of the alkylated ketone Ket13-K, the subsequent transformation for α -alkylation of p-MeOC6H4COCH3 with PhCH2OH has two selectable reaction channels: One, consisting of stages II and III, is the main channel, via which most of alkylated ketones are produced, and the other, consisting of stages II, III, IV, and V, is the side channel, via which very few alkylated ketones are afforded. In the following, we will discuss the calculated results on the production of alkylated alcohol and ketone in terms of the above reaction stages, respectively."
3,Production of alkylated alcohol,"3.1 Production of alkylated alcohol 3.1.1 Mediator generation MPV-O redox reactions of carbonyl compounds with alcohols have been studied extensively [61–69], and the investigations showed Al(III)-, Sn(IV)-, and Zr(IV)-isopropoxides are the mediators [65–69]. On heterogeneous catalysis, basic oxides such as MgO can catalyze MPV-O reduction of crotonaldehyde with ethanol to yield crotyl alcohol [70]. However, these previous reports do not involve the formation of new CC bonds, and do not refer to the active mediator of the alkali-metal sodium. Therefore, we initiated the investigation by calculating and comparing all the possible Na species. Key Na species are collected in Fig. 4 (A), and the others are shown in Fig. S1. When comparing the disodium species Na1B, Na6-10, Na1C/c, Na1D/d, and Na19-35 with the monosodium species NaOH, Na1-5, Na1A, and Na11-18, one can find that the formation of the disodium species is strongly preferred. A plausible explanation for this phenomenon is that these four-membered dinuclear sodium species encompass one NaNa interaction and four NaO interactions, which can be confirmed by the short NaNa and NaO distances shown in Fig. 4(B). When comparing the disodium alkoxide parent species Na1C and Na1D with their corresponding derivatives Na19-26 and Na27-35 with additional ligands (PhCH2OH, PhCOCH3, or H2O), one can find that the parent species are much more stable. Meanwhile, it can also be found that the disodium alkoxide complex Na1D is the most stable in the beginning reaction solution. During the calculations, we also found that Na1C and Na1D can isomerize to the structures Na1c and Na1d by rotating the phenyl group around the C1O bond via the transition states TS-Na1C and TS-Na1D, respectively (Note: TS-Na1C denotes the transition state that connects to the intermediate Na1C). The facts that Na1C and Na1D are more stable than Na1c and Na1d, respectively, may be explained that Na1C and Na1D involve an additional interaction between the sodium and the near phenyl group. In spite of the great energy preference for the generation of disodium species, the involvement of monosodium alkoxide species in aldehyde formation can not be excluded, because a more stable starting material (intermediate) may not lead to a more favourable transition state (Curtin-Hammett Principle). Therefore, we will examine all the possible alkoxide species for aldehyde formation in the following. When the energy barriers of different reaction pathways are compared, the most stable disodium alkoxide complex Na1D is chosen as the energy reference point. 3.1.2 Aldehyde formation As compared in Fig. 5 and Fig. S2, Na1D-mediated aldehyde formation via MPV-O alcohol oxidation is the most favourable (black pathway), in which Na1D must first isomerize to Na1d. Then coordination of PhCOCH3 to Na1d gives the direct precursor complex Na2d of the hydride transfer. The subsequent hydride transfer from the alkoxide carbon to the carbonyl carbon of PhCOCH3 provides the six-membered cyclic transition state TS-Na2d, in which the distances of HC ⋯ H and MeC ⋯ H are 1.49 and 1.26 Å, respectively. Relative to Na1D, this transition state has an energy of 32.9 kcal/mol. Finally, the cleavage of the CH bond of the alkoxide takes place, leading to the PhCHO-coordinated intermediate Na3d, which can further decompose into PhCHO and the alkoxide complex Na4d with an energy change of −13.8 kcal/mol. The alkoxide complex Na1C was also considered for MPV-O aldehyde formation (Fig. 5, red pathway). The transition state TS-Na2c for the hydride transfer from Na1c to PhCOCH3, possessing a six-membered cyclic structure, is located at an energy of 36.5 kcal/mol above Na1D, 3.6 kcal/mol higher than TS-Na2d, so Na1C-mediated aldehyde formation can be ruled out. All the other possible hydride transfer transition states for MPV-O aldehyde formation (Fig. S2) have a six-membered cyclic structure, and are much higher than the preferred transition state TS-Na2d. And given that all the hydride transfer transition states for aldehyde formation have the same energy reference point Na1D, so MPV-O aldehyde formation via these transition states displayed in Fig. S2 can be disregarded. Note that the transition states TS-Na2d, TS-Na2c, and TS-Na1A are all more stable than the corresponding transition states with an additional ligand (PhCH2OH, PhCOCH3, or H2O), thus we will not consider the cases with an additional ligand in the subsequent MPV-O reduction. 3.1.3 Aldol condensation The second stage for α -alkylation of ketones with alcohols shown in Fig. 3 is the condensation of PhCOCH3 with PhCHO, in which the enolization of PhCOCH3 is required. The most favourable enolization pathway is shown in Fig. 6 , in which PhCOCH3 first associates with the mediator Na1D to give the ketone-coordinated intermediate Na2D, which then undergoes the six-membered cyclic transition state TS-Na2D for the proton transfer to give the unstable intermediate Na3D with a OH ⋯ C hydrogen bond. Finally, the dissociation of PhCH2OH from Na3D leads to the formation of the reactive enolate Na4D. The energy barrier for Na1D-mediated enolization of PhCOCH3 is 21.8 kcal/mol. Because Na4D is less stable than Na1D by 6.7 kcal/mol, this enolization process is thermodynamically unfavourable. Na1C- and Na1B-mediated enolization of PhCOCH3 were also considered (see Fig. S3). In these three proposed reaction pathways, the energy barriers are 24.3 (TS-Na2C-OH relative to Na1D—the resting state of Na1C), 22.2 (TS-Na2C relative to Na1D—the resting state of Na1C), and 27.7 kcal/mol (TS-Na2B relative to Na1D—the resting state of Na1B), respectively. Compared with the barrier in the most favourable enolization pathway, only Na1C-mediated enolization of PhCOCH3 (using the PhCH2O group as the proton acceptor) may be feasible, thus the enolate Na4C generated from this pathway will be considered in chalcone formation. Note that PhCHO and Na4D, separately generated from the most favourable aldehyde-forming reaction (Fig. 5) and the most favourable enolization process (Fig. 6), come from the same initial reactants, Na1D and PhCOCH3. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss these two reactions by comparison. Because the transition state TS-Na2D leading to Na4D is 11.1 kcal/mol lower than TS-Na2d connecting to PhCHO, the formation of Na4D is able to limit the generation of PhCHO. And because the Na4D-forming reaction (Na1D + PhCOCH3 → Na4D +PhCH2OH) is thermodynamically unfavorable, and the aldol condensation can not proceed further before aldehyde formation, Na1D-mediated aldehyde formation may also occur. Once PhCHO is generated, the aldol condensation will continue to move forward. Fig. 7 displays the free energy profiles for chalcone formation and the optimized geometries of key transition states. In the preferred pathway (black pathway), the binding of PhCHO to the enolate Na4D gives the intermediate Na5D, which undergoes the six-membered cyclic transition state TS-Na5D for the CC bond formation with an energy barrier of 18.8 kcal/mol relative to Na4D + PhCHO to deliver the intermediate Na6D. From Na6D, we considered two possible H-transfer shuttles (PhCH2OH and H2O) for the CC bond formation because the previous studies have manifested the H-transfer shuttle could greatly promote an H-transfer process [71–76]. In the preferred CC bond-forming process, PhCH2OH first binds to Na6D with an OH ⋯ O hydrogen bond and an interaction between the sodium and the phenyl group to supply the intermediate Na7D. Subsequently, the binded alcohol donates the proton of the hydroxyl group to the NaO bond and abstracts the proton of the CH2 moiety of the alkoxide, which results in the formation of the intermediate Na8D containing a CC bond. Relative to Na7D, the concerted proton-transfer transition state TS-Na7D for the CC bond formation has an energy of 19.3 kcal/mol, which is 3.1 kcal/mol lower than TS-Na7D-Wat with one water molecule as the shuttle (in blue), and 5.8 kcal/mol lower than TS-Na7D-Alc with two benzyl alcohol molecules as the shuttle (in pink). Thus, the CC bond-forming process with one water molecule or with two benzyl alcohol molecules as the proton-transfer shuttle can be ruled out. The result that an alcohol molecule is much more favourable than a water molecule in promoting proton transfer agrees with the previous findings [71,72]. After the formation of Na8D, the cleavage of the COH bond to afford the chalcone Na9D and to generate the alkoxide complex Na1C is facile because this step only requires an energy barrier of 17.3 kcal/mol (TS-Na8D with respect to Na8D). Na1C can easily react with PhCH2OH, leading to the regeneration of the mediator Na1D (Fig. 4). The coupling between PhCHO and the enolate Na4C (red pathway), very similar to the coupling of PhCHO with Na4D, also needs to overcome three energy barriers: the CC bond-forming barrier (23.8 kcal/mol, TS-Na5C relative to Na4D + PhCHO; Note: Na4D and the following Na7D and Na8D are all the off-cycle species for the coupling between PhCHO and Na4C), the CC bond-forming barrier (23.2 kcal/mol, TS-Na7C relative to Na7D), and the COH bond cleavage barrier (19.8 kcal/mol, TS-Na8C relative to Na8D). They are all much higher than the corresponding barrier in the coupling of PhCHO with Na4D because of the influence of the off-cycle species. Thus, the coupling between PhCHO and Na4C can be ruled out. Ionic mechanism for the condensation of PhCOCH3 with PhCHO was also considered here (Fig. S4). The calculations show that the ionization of Na1D and Na1C to generate PhCH2O− or OH− is energetically unfavorable, and the lowest apparent activation energy (AAE) for the proposed ionic mechanism is as high as 60.9 kcal/mol. Thus, the ionic mechanism can be ruled out. 3.1.4 Chalcone reduction The condensation of PhCOCH3 with PhCHO in stage II results in the reactive chalcone Na9D, which will undergo MPV-O reduction to give the alkylated ketone. Because a number of hydrogen donors exist in the reaction mixture, such as PhCH2OH, PhCOCH3, H2O, Na1C, and Na1D, there are several possible pathways for the reduction of Na9D. As shown in Fig. 8 , Na1D-mediated chalcone reduction is the most favorable (black pathway), in which the binding of the chalcone Na9D to the isomer Na1d of Na1D generates the intermediate Na10D, initiating the chalcone reduction. The CH bond of the alkoxide part then breaks and the hydride transfers to the β -C of the chalcone moiety via the transition state TS-Na10D (see Fig. 9 ) with a relative energy of 27.5 kcal/mol to Na1D + Na9D, leading to the formation of the catalytic PhCHO and the enolate Na11D. Because they are 43.9 kcal/mol lower than TS-Na10D, the β -C hydrogenation is irreversible. Thus, this β -C hydrogenation can provide the driving force for the previous thermodynamically unfavourable aldehyde formation and aldol condensation. After the formation of Na11D, PhCH2OH will coordinate to one of its Na centers, yielding Na12D. Then the proton from the hydroxyl group moves to the C2 atom of the enolate anion via the transition state TS-Na12D, leading to the formation of the alkylated ketone Ket13-Na and the regeneration of the mediator Na1D. The two energy barriers from Na9D to Ket13-Na are not high, and the formation of Ket13-Na is much favorable thermodynamically. Therefore, Na9D, once formed, will be reduced by Na1D immediately, consistent with the observation that chalcone intermediates were not detected in the reaction media [47]. H2O and PhCOCH3 were also considered as the proton donors for the C2 protonation of Na11D (blue and pink pathways, respectively). The protonation barrier with H2O is 23.1 kcal/mol (TS-Na12D-Wat relative to Na11D + H2O), a little higher than the protonation barrier with PhCH2OH, thus this pathway is also possible. The protonation barrier with PhCOCH3 is 30.9 kcal/mol (TS-Na12D-Ket relative to Na11D + PhCOCH3), much higher than the protonation barrier with PhCH2OH, so this pathway can be excluded. Na1C-mediated chalcone reduction was also considered (red pathway). Similar to the chalcone reduction with Na1D, there are also two hydrogenation barriers: the β -C hydrogenation barrier (TS-Na10C relative to Na1D + Na9D) and the C2 protonation barrier (TS-Na12C relative to Na11D). These two barriers are 2.2 and 1.9 kcal/mol higher than the corresponding barriers in the most favourable pathway, respectively. Thus, Na1C-mediated chalcone reduction may take place sometimes. 3.1.5 Reduction of alkylated ketone For MPV-O reduction of the alkylated ketone Ket13-Na, several possible pathways were considered (Fig. 10 ). The black pathway with Na1D as the mediator is the most favourable. Similar to MPV-O reduction of chalcone Na9D, the reduction of Ket13-Na takes place stepwise via the transition state TS-Na13D for the carbonyl carbon hydrogenation and the transition state TS-Na15D for the alkoxy oxygen protonation (Fig. 11 ). TS-Na13D has a six-membered cyclic structure, in which the hydride lies between the alkoxy carbon and the carbonyl carbon ((O)C ⋯ H = 1.31 Å and (O) C ⋯ H = 1.41 Å), closer to the alkoxy carbon. This transition state leads to the formation of the catalytic PhCHO. Because TS-Na13D has an energy of 35.2 kcal/mol relative to Na1D + Ket13-Na, high temperature is required. TS-Na15D also has a six-membered structure, in which the distances of PhCH2O ⋯ H and Ph(CH2)2C(Ph) HO ⋯ H are 1.19 and 1.23 Å, respectively. Note that this protonation transition state is 2.9 kcal/mol higher than its front intermediate Na15D in terms of electronic energy, but lower after the free energy corrections. A similar situation has happened in alcohol dehydrogenation [77], nitrogen heterocycles dehydrogenation [78], and imine hydrogenation [79]. After the protonation, the alkylated alcohol product Alc16-Na is obtained and the mediator Na1D is regenerated. The reduction of Ket13-Na, from Na1D + Ket13-Na to Alc16-Na + Na1D, is endergonic by 2.7 kcal/mol, thus requiring an excess of PhCH2OH to shift the reduction forward. And because the reduction of one chalcone molecule to an alkylated alcohol requires two alcohol molecules, more than 2 equivalents of PhCH2OH will favor the production of alkylated alcohols, consistent with the reaction condition (3 equivalents of PhCH2OH)[45]. H2O and PhCOCH3 were also considered for the alkoxy oxygen protonation of Na14D (blue and pink pathways, respectively). Using H2O as the proton donor, the protonation barrier is only 4.0 kcal/mol (TS-Na15D-Wat relative to Na14D + H2O), so the alkoxy oxygen protonation of Na14D with H2O is also possible. Using PhCOCH3 as the proton donor, the protonation barrier is 16.8 kcal/mol (TS-Na15D-Ket relative to Na14D + PhCOCH3), thus this pathway can be disregarded. The hydride donor Na1C was also considered for the reduction of Ket13-Na (red pathway). The energy barrier for the carbonyl carbon hydrogenation of Ket13-Na using Na1C is 37.0 kcal/mol (TS-Na13C relative to Ket13-Na + Na1D), too high to overcome, so this hydrogenation can be ruled out. While the protonation barrier in Na1C-mediated reduction of Ket13-Na is only 3.1 kcal/mol (TS-Na15C relative to Na14D + H2O), so this protonation process may also happen. 3.1.6 Discussion on production of alkylated alcohol The β -C hydrogenation barrier in chalcone reduction (TS-Na10D relative to Na1D + Na9D) is 5.4 kcal/mol lower than the aldehyde-forming barrier in MPV-O alcohol oxidation (TS-Na2d relative to Na1D + PhCOCH3), and the β -C hydrogenation, from Na1D + Na9D to PhCHO + Na11D, is thermodynamically downhill by 16.4 kcal/mol while the aldehyde formation, from Na1D + PhCOCH3 to PhCHO + Na4d, is thermodynamically uphill by 4.5 kcal/mol, thus we can conclude that the chalcone reduction is more favourable for the formation of PhCHO than the alcohol oxidation. Also note that the alcohol oxidation to PhCHO can not compete with the enolization of PhCOCH3. Then we can draw the following conclusions: (1) The alcohol oxidation shown in Fig. 5 only takes place at the beginning of the reaction, and will stop when an aldehyde is given by stage III. (2) Only a few aldehydes are generated by the alcohol oxidation. And (3) only a few Na4d are generated, so they are not considered in stages II, III, and IV. In fact, Na4d can be reoxidized to Na1D and PhCOCH3 by PhCHO generated from stage III or IV (see Fig. 5). The detailed DFT calculations described above also disclose that the ketones PhCOCH3 are not only the reactants, but also are the initiators that facilitate the formation of the catalytic aldehydes (Fig. 5). Once formed, aldehydes will function as the catalysts to make the subsequent α -alkylation reaction proceed via the catalytic cycle cyc-Na consisting of stages II, III, and IV. This result is consistent with the experimental reports that carbonyl compounds have catalytic effects [47,49,80]. The AAEs in stages II-III (II + III) and II-IV (II + III + IV) are 29.5 (TS-Na7D relative to Na4D + PhCHO + PhCH2OH; Note: In the calculation of the AAE, the reversibility of MPV-O oxidation of PhCH2OH (stage I) and the enolization of PhCOCH3 can be disregarded because high concentration of Na1D can drive these two reactions forward) and 35.2 kcal/mol (TS-Na13D relative to Na1D + Ket13-Na), respectively (see Table 1 ). These two AAEs indicate that the production of alkylated alcohol requires higher temperature while the formation of alkylated ketone requires lower temperature, i.e., the product selectivity may be enhanced by raising or lowering reaction temperature. To know more about the kinetic information on the production of the alkylated alcohol, a Fortran program [81] developed for the energetic span model [82] is used to calculate the degree of turnover frequency (TOF) control ( X TOF , i ) and the TOF. The calculated degree of TOF control shows that Na11D with X TOF , I = 0.16 is the TOF-affecting intermediate, Na1D and Ket13-Na with X TOF , I = 0.83 are the TOF-determining intermediates, and TS-Na13D with X TOF , T = 0.97 is the TOF-determining transition state. Thus, the energetic span (the energy difference between the TOF-determining transition state and the TOF-determining intermediates) for the whole catalytic cycle cyc-Na is 35.2 kcal/mol, which is just the AAE in stage II-IV. The calculated TOF is 5.7 × 10 - 7 1/s, roughly agreeing with the experimental data [45]. Because Na1D and Ket13-Na are the TOF-determining intermediates, the more Na1D and Ket13-Na are afforded, the higher the TOF of the whole catalytic transformation is. The formation of Ket13-Na is affected by the concentrations of Na1D and Na9D, so the more Na1D and Na9D are afforded, the higher the TOF of Ket13-Na is. The formation of Na9D is affected by the concentration of Na1D—high concentration of Na1D favours the formation of Na9D by driving MPV-O oxidation of PhCH2OH and the enolization of PhCOCH3 forward. Therefore, higher TOF requires higher concentration of Na1D, i.e., requires higher concentrations of NaOH and PhCH2OH. To confirm the results obtained from the B2PLYPD3/6-311G++(d,p) computations, the double-hybrid functionals mPW2PLYPD and PBE0DH with the larger basis set 6-311G++(2df,2p) were employed to recalculate the single-point energies of key states. As compared in Table 1, although the energies of key states have numerical differences at these three double-hybrid functional levels, the calculations consistently support the following conclusions: (1) The pathway with Na1D as the mediator is more favourable than with Na1C (Entries 2 vs 4, 6 vs 8, 10 vs 13, and 15 vs 18); (2) An alcohol molecule is much more favourable than a water molecule in promoting proton transfer (Entries 6 vs 8); (3) For the whole transformation, the mediator Na1D and the alkylated ketone Ket13-Na are the TOF-determining intermediates, and the transition state TS-Na13D for the carbonyl carbon hydrogenation is the TOF-determining transition state (Entries 11, 14, and 15); And (4) the mechanism for the production of alkylated alcohol shown in Fig. 3 is the most favourable."
4,Production of alkylated ketone,"3.2 Production of alkylated ketone 3.2.1 Transformation for production of alkylated ketone There are many similarities between the production of alkylated alcohol and the production of alkylated ketone, so for the production of alkylated ketone, we only discuss important or different calculated results in the preferred pathway. In the initial reaction solution, a number of K species may coexist through ligand exchange. But based on the results obtained from the production of alkylated alcohol, only key K species are displayed in Fig. 12 . At the beginning of the reaction, the calculated energies favor the formation of the dipotassium alkoxide mediator K1D. As the reaction progresses, K1D will gradually decrease. But K1D + K1B are more stable than 2 · K1C, so K1D is always the mediator for the whole transformation. After the generation of K1D, only a few of them are oxidized by the ketone p-MeOC6H4COCH3 to produce PhCHO via the transition state TS-K2d with an energy 36.4 kcal/mol relative to K1D + p-MeOC6H4COCH3 (stage I, Fig. S5). And some K1D take part in mediating the condensation of PhCHO with p-MeOC6H4COCH3 (stage II, Figs. S6 and S7). The transformation details in this condensation are the same as those in the production of alkylated alcohol except for the highest transition state. In K1D-mediated system, the highest transition state is the transition state TS-K8D for the COH cleavage, but in Na1D-mediated system, the highest transition state is the transition state TS-Na7D for the CC bond formation. Such difference may be attributed to hard cations allowing strong coordination (Na > K, HSAB theory [83]). But because the formation of the CC bond and the cleavage of the COH bond can be viewed as the two substeps of the dehydration phase of aldol condensation, the two highest transition states are still consistent with the early reports that the dehydration phase requires higher activation energy than the addition phase [84]. Next, we will focus on the acquisition of alkylated ketone via chalcone reduction (stage III, Fig. 13 ). The transition state TS-K10D for the β -C hydrogenation (OC ⋯ H = 1.33 Å and C β ⋯ H = 1.42 Å) is located at an energy of 25.9 kcal/mol above K1D + K9D. This transition state leads to the formation of the catalytic PhCHO and the enolate intermediate K11D, 43.8 kcal/mol lower than TS-K10D, so this β -C hydrogenation is irreversible. The C2 protonation of K11D to produce the alkylated ketone Ket13-K has two options: One uses an alcohol as the proton donor, and the other employs a water as the proton donor. The protonation barriers in the two cases are 16.7 and 17.5 kcal/mol, respectively. Thus, the alcohol is the preferred proton donor at the beginning of the reaction, and the water gradually becomes the favourable proton donor with the alcohol decrease. The C2 protonation process with an alcohol is thermodynamically favorable, while the C2 protonation process with a water is thermodynamically unfavorable, but the excess water can drive the protonation forward. After the formation of the alkylated ketone Ket13-K, it can be further reduced by K1D (stage IV). As shown in Fig. 14 , the carbonyl carbon hydrogenation barrier of Ket13-K (TS-K13D relative to K1D + Ket13-K) is 34.1 kcal/mol, 8.2 kcal/mol higher than the β -C hydrogenation barrier of K9D, thus the carbonyl carbon hydrogenation can not compete with the β -C hydrogenation. Even so, the carbonyl carbon hydrogenation may also take place sporadically because the carbonyl carbon hydrogenation barrier is not high enough, still lower than the aldehyde formation barrier (stage I). The carbonyl carbon hydrogenation results in PhCHO and the alkoxide K14D. The latter may react with the proton donor, such as PhCH2OH, to generate the alkylated alcohol Alc16-K and K1D. The alkoxide K14D can also be oxidized by dioxygen (stage V). The binding of the dioxygen in the triplet state to K14D generates the triplet-state intermediate 3 K15D, which leads to the formation of the hyperoxide K16D and the regeneration of the alkylated ketone Ket13-K via the transition state 3 TS-K15D for the hydride transfer. The CH and OH distances in 3 K15D are 1.12 and 2.19 Å, and in 3 TS-K15D are 1.47 and 1.18 Å, respectively, confirming the CH bond-breaking and OH bond-forming processes. The hydride transfer barrier for the regeneration of the alkylated ketone is 24.7 kcal/mol ( 3 TS-K15D relative to K14D + 3O2), 9.4 kcal/mol lower than its front carbonyl carbon hydrogenation barrier, so the oxidation of K14D is much easier than the reduction of Ket13-K. The regeneration of Ket13-K (K1D + Ket13-K + 3O2 → PhCHO + Ket13-K + K16D) is highly exergonic by 20.1 kcal/mol, while the formation of the alkylated alcohol Alc16-K (K1D + Ket13-K + PhCH2OH → PhCHO + K1D + Alc16-K) is endergonic by 3.7 kcal/mol. Thus, even if Ket13-K is reduced by K1D, it will also be regenerated by 3O2. And note that chalcone reduction affords the ketone Ket13-K as the alkylated product, so Ket13-K is the dominant alkylated product for the whole transformation, consistent with the highly selective experimental observation [45]. It is worth noting that the reduction of one chalcone molecule requires one alcohol molecule (stage III), and the reduction of alkylated ketone (stage IV) and the dioxygen-assisted oxidation of alkylated alcohol (stage V) can only take place sporadically, thus the production of alkylated ketone requires more than 1 equivalent of alcohol, also consistent with the experimental condition (1.2 equivalents of alcohol)[45]. 3.2.2 Discussion on production of alkylated ketone The barrier for the β -C hydrogenation of K9D (Fig. 13) is much lower than that for MPV-O alcohol oxidation (Fig. S5). The β -C hydrogenation is thermodynamically favourable while the alcohol oxidation is thermodynamically unfavourable. Thus, we can draw the same conclusion as above: The aldehyde formation via the β -C hydrogenation is more favourable than via the alcohol oxidation. And because the alcohol oxidation to PhCHO can not compete with the enolization of the ketone p-MeOC6H4COCH3 (Fig. S6), the alcohol oxidation shown in Fig. S5 can only take place at the beginning of the reaction, too, and will stop when an aldehyde is given by the β -C hydrogenation. The ketones p-MeOC6H4COCH3 also function as the initiators to facilitate the formation of the catalytic aldehydes. But once formed, aldehydes will act as the catalysts to make the subsequent α -alkylation reaction proceed via two optional channels. The direct channel or the main channel, consisting of stages II and III, is a catalytic cycle (cyc-K). Using the above-mentioned Fortran program, we also calculated the degree of TOF control and the TOF of cyc-K. The obtained degree of TOF control shows that K11D with X TOF , I = 0.26 is the TOF-affecting intermediate, the enolate K4D and PhCHO with X TOF , I = 0.74 are the TOF-determining intermediates (Note: High concentration of K1D can provide the driving force for the thermodynamically unfavorable formation of PhCHO (stage I) and enolization of p-MeOC6H4COCH3, i.e., can compensate for the unfavorable thermodynamics in the two reactions, so the enolate K4D and PhCHO can be viewed as the TOF-determining intermediates), and the transition state TS-K10D for the β -C hydrogenation with X TOF , T = 1.00 is the TOF-determining transition state. Thus, the energetic span for the whole catalytic cycle cyc-K is 29.5 kcal/mol. The calculated TOF is 8.8 × 10 - 5 1/s, agreeing well with the experimental data [45]. The indirect channel or the side channel consists of stages II, III, IV and V, in which the AAE (the barrier for the carbonyl carbon hydrogenation) is 34.1 kcal/mol. The energetic span in the main channel and the AAE in the side channel indicate lower temperature and lower concentration of alcohol favor the production of alkylated ketone via the main channel. Comparing the barrier for the aldehyde formation (36.4 kcal/mol), the energetic span in the main channel, and the AAE in the side channel, we can find that the experimental high temperature is required by the aldehyde formation. Thus, we can reason that the alkylated ketone selectivity may be enhanced by addition of a small quantity of aldehyde corresponding to the alcohol reactant and lowering the reaction temperature. The calculated results on the production of alkylated ketone not only reveal the origins of the ketone product selectivity, but also perfect the α -alkylation mechanism of ketones with alcohols. To test the functional dependence, the double-hybrid functionals mPW2PLYPD and PBE0DH with 6-311G++(2df,2p) were used to recalculate the single-point energies of the key states. The calculation results at different DFT levels consistently support the above conclusions (see Table S1 for details). 3.2.3 Reactivity of different benzylic alcohols To investigate the reactivity origins of different benzylic alcohols in the production of alkylated ketone, we calculated the energetic spans in the main reaction channels by choosing various benzylic alcohols and p-MeOC6H4COCH3 as the reactants. The calculated energetic results are summarized in Table 2 . The energetic span with benzyl alcohol (entry 1) is slightly larger than with the more electron-rich 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol (entry 2), and also larger than with the electron-poor 4-chlorobenzyl alcohol (entry 4), but smaller than with the electron-poor 4-fluorobenzyl alcohol (entry 3). The sterically congested 3-chlorobenzyl alcohol and 2-chlorobenzyl alcohol (entries 5 and 6) are slightly less reactive in substance, so the energetic spans with them are larger than with benzyl alcohol. These electronic and steric effects on the energetic spans fit the experimentally observed reactivities of different benzyl alcohols very well [45]. These results not only indirectly prove the transition state TS-K10D for the β -C hydrogenation is the TOF-determining transition state, and the enolate K4D and PhCHO are the TOF-determining intermediates in the main channel of the model reaction, but also provide further support for the above calculated mechanism on the production of alkylated ketone."
5,Conclusions,"We have thoroughly studied the selective autocatalyzed α -alkylation mechanism of ketones with alcohols promoted by NaOH or KOH by conducting DFT calculations, and established feasible catalytic transformations for the productions of alkylated alcohol and alkylated ketone. For the production of alkylated alcohol, the mediator is identified to be the disodium alkoxide species Na1D, and the whole transformation includes four stages: (I) MPV-O alcohol oxidation, generating a catalytic aldehyde and initializing the reaction; (II) condensation of the aldehyde with a ketone, affording a chalcone intermediate; (III) MPV-O reduction of the chalcone intermediate, generating an alkylated ketone and a new aldehyde; and (IV) MPV-O reduction of the alkylated ketone, producing an alkylated alcohol and another new aldehyde. Stage I, stage IV, and the enolization process in stage II are thermodynamically unfavourable, requiring the excess Na1D to provide the driving force, thus the excess NaOH and PhCH2OH are necessary. Stage I only occurs at the beginning of the reaction, and will stop when an aldehyde is given by stage III. The subsequent α -alkylation reaction will proceed via the catalytic cycle cyc-Na consisting of the last three stages. The energetic span and the TOF of cyc-Na are 35.2 kcal/mol and 5.7 × 10 - 7 1/s, respectively. The degree of TOF control shows that the transition state TS-Na13D for the carbonyl carbon hydrogenation is the TOF-determining transition state, and the alkylated ketone Ket13-Na and the disodium mediator Na1D are the TOF-determining intermediates. For the production of alkylated ketone, the dipotassium alkoxide species K1D is the mediator, and the transforation includes five stages. Stages I, II, III, and IV are the same as the production of alkylated alcohol, and stage V is dioxygen-assisted oxidation of alkylated alcohol. Stage I also takes place at the beginning of the reaction, and will stop when an aldehyde is given by stage III. The subsequent α -alkylation reaction has two optional reaction channels: The main channel, consisting of stages II and III, is a catalytic cycle (cyc-K), in which the degree of TOF control shows that the transition state TS-K10D for the β -C hydrogenation is the TOF-determining transition state, and the enolate K4D and PhCHO are the TOF-determining intermediates. The energetic span and the TOF of cyc-K are 29.5 kcal/mol and 8.8 × 10 - 5 1/s, respectively. The side channel involves stages II, III, IV, and V, in which the AAE is 34.1 kcal/mol. Stage I and the enolization process in stage II are thermodynamically unfavourable, requiring the excess dipotassium alkoxide mediator K1D to provide the driving force. And because the mediator will be deactivated by dioxygen in stage V, the excess KOH and PhCH2OH are necessary. From the discussions on the productions of alkylated alcohol and alkylated ketone, we can draw the following conclusions: (1) alcohol oxidation, chalcone reduction, and reduction of alkylated ketone all proceed via the classic MPV-O redox processes, and there is no hydride transfer via the coordination of the sp 2-carbon to the alkali-metal sodium or potassium shown in Fig. 2(B). (2) The autocatalyzed essence is ketones are not only the reactants, but also are the initiators that facilitate the formation of the catalytic aldehydes, and once aldehydes are formed, the α -alkylation reaction will enter into the bis-alkali metal alkoxide Na1D/K1D-mediated catalytic cycle using aldehydes as the catalytic species. And (3) higher temperature and higher concentration of alcohol (more than 2 equivalents) favor the production of alkylated alcohol, while lower temperature and lower concentration of alcohol (more than 1 equivalent) favor the production of alkylated ketone and the dioxygen can further enhance the ketone product selectivity. One important finding regarding the production of alkylated ketone is that the activation barrier for aldehyde formation (stage I) is much higher than the energetic span in the main channel, and a little higher than the AAE in the side channel, thus the alkylated ketone selectivity may be enhanced by lowering the reaction temperature and adding a small quantity of aldehyde corresponding to the alcohol reactant. The studied reactions are only two specific cases, but the results obtained from the calculations can shed light on the general modes for selective autocatalyzed α -alkylation of ketones with alcohols promoted by bases. Thus, we believe that this paper will benefit the design of transition-metal-free aldehyde- or ketone-catalyzed systems and the green synthesis."
