0,Introduction,"Cyclodextrins (CDs) are cyclic oligosaccharides consisting of five or more d-glucopyranoses linked by α-1,4-glucosidic bonds (Zhang et al., 2015). The most common CDs are α-, β-, and γ-CD, which are composed of 6, 7 and 8 glucose units, respectively (Dinar, Sahra, Seridi, & Kadri, 2014; Li, Li, Holler, Gu, & Li, 2014). The steric arrangement of the glucose units in these CDs forms the shape of a hollow truncated cone with a hydrophilic outside surface, which makes CDs water-soluble, and a hydrophobic internal cavity, which enables CDs to form inclusion complexes with various hydrophobic guest molecules (Pinho, Grootveld, Soares, & Henriques, 2014). The advantageous changes of guest molecular properties caused by inclusion complex formation have led to many applications of CDs, especially in the food industry for stabilizing the active compounds, removing the undesirable odor, and improving the emulsion stability. (Li et al., 2018; Yoshikiyo et al., 2019). CDs are produced from starch or starch derivates using cyclodextrin glycosyltransferases (CGTase, EC 2.4.1.19). These enzymes usually produce a mixture that includes mainly α-, β- and γ-CD (Terada, Yanase, Takata, Takaha, & Okada, 1997). The methods used to produce CDs are generally divided into those that use organic solvents and those that do not. In the non-solvent processes, enzymatic activity produces a CD mixture that must be further separated by chromatographic procedures. In the solvent processes, organic complexing agents are added to selectively extract one type of CD. This selective extraction enhances the enzymatic production of the desired CD; thus, it is commonly used to produce CDs on an industrial scale. Accumulation of a certain type of CD during the enzymatic reaction has been shown to inhibit its own synthesis (Zhekova, Dobrev, Stanchev, & Pishtiyski, 2009). Addition of a suitable organic solvent can reduce this product inhibition, thereby increasing the specificity of CD production (de Schöffer et al., 2017; Meng et al., 2018; Nativida). Some researchers believe that organic solvents, especially hydrophobic organic solvents, promote the cyclization reaction by directly inhibiting the hydrolytic and coupling activities of CGTase. Other researchers have shown that organic solvents form inclusion complexes that hinder CD binding to the active site of CGTase, thereby reducing product inhibition and promoting CD synthesis (Blackwood & Bucke, 2000). Gawande et al. (2001) have shown that adding 2% (v/v) n-butanol to a reaction system containing the α-CGTase from Klebsiella pneumoniae AS-22 induces a 2.8-fold increase in the yield of α-CD. The addition of isopropanol, ethanol, or tert-butyl to a reaction system containing the CGTase from Bacillus sp. BE 101 also improves the synthesis of α-CD (Lee & Kim, 1992; Zaks & Klibanov, 1985). Further studies have shown that long-chain organic solvents (>8 carbon atoms), especially those having polar groups at the end of the chain (fatty alcohols, thiols, fatty acids and bromides), are more suitable as complexing agents for the enzymatic preparation of α-CD. In summary, several researchers have shown that CD yield and selectivity are significantly influenced by the use of organic compounds that form insoluble or highly stable inclusion compounds with CD. However, studies investigating the mechanism by which alcohol complexing agents influence CD yield and selectivity are rare, and general conclusions applicable to future research have not yet been reached. Compared with β-CD and γ-CD, α-CD has a smaller cyclic structure, which could not be digested in the gastrointestinal tract and meanwhile significantly promote the growth of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria for intestinal health. Coupled with the good water solubility, α-CD has become one of the most widely used soluble dietary fibers in the food industry (Andreu-Sevilla, López-Nicolás, Carbonell-Barrachina, & García-Carmona, 2011). Thus, improving the yield of α-CD is of great importance because the current production levels have led to a high price and small market share (Li, Chen, Gu, Chen, & Wu, 2014). In the present report, we describe a systematic investigation of the effects of twenty five different alcohol complexing agents on α-CD production using the α-CGTase from Paenibacillus macerans JFB05-01. The data presented here provides a deeper understanding of the mechanism by which alcohol complexing agents influence the enzymatic production of α-cyclodextrin, or related cyclodextrins."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The α-CGTase from P. macerans JFB05-01 was obtained from our laboratory using the method described by Li, Li, Cheng, Chen, and Wu (2008). α-, β-, and γ-CD standards were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Maltodextrin (DE 3) was purchased from Roquette Fine Chemical Co., Ltd. (Jiangsu, China). All other general chemicals were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. (Shanghai, China)."
3,Methods,"2.2 Methods 2.2.1 Enzymatic preparation of CD The preparation of CDs under conditions resembling the industrial production process was performed as described (Li et al., 2016), with minor modifications. Briefly, maltodextrin (DE 3, 15%, w/v) substrate in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) was pasted in boiling water bath. After natural cooling, 3 U/g α-CGTase was added to the mixture along with the alcohol complexing agent. A sample without added alcohol was used as a control. The solutions were incubated with stirring (200 rpm) at 40 °C for 24 h, and then the enzymes were inactivated by incubation in a boiling water bathing. The complexing agent was removed by liquid-liquid extraction, and then glucoamylase (2 U/mL) was added to further degrade the short-chain linear polysaccharides, especially those with 6, 7 or 8 glucose units, which would interfere with the measurement of CD content. After saccharification on a rotary shaker (30 °C, 200 rpm) for 2 h, enzyme deactivation was repeated by incubation in a boiling water bathing. The final solution was filtered (0.45 μm) and collected for α-, β- and γ-CD content measurement. The yields and proportions of α-, β- and γ-CDs were subsequently calculated. 2.2.2 Determination of α-cyclization activity The rate of α-CD formation (α-cyclization activity) was determined using the methyl orange method (Li, Ban, Gu, & Li, 2013). 2.2.3 Chromatographic determination of α-, β- and γ- CD A high-performance liquid chromatographic method (Lejeune, Sakaguchi, & Imanaka, 1989) was used to determine the α-, β- and γ-CD contents of enzymatic reaction mixtures. Briefly, samples (10 μL) were loaded onto a Hypersil NH2 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm), which was subsequently eluted with acetonitrile/water (61/39, v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at 30 °C. 2.2.4 Binding constant determinations The indicator methyl orange and α-CD form a 1:1 inclusion complex. In this complex, the methyl end of the methyl orange is embedded in the α-CD cavity, and the azo group (-NN-) forms a hydrogen bond with a hydroxyl group on the external surface of the α-CD. Acidic conditions cause a change in the UV absorption spectrum of the methyl orange (Connors, Mulski, & Paulson, 1992; Li et al., 2020). In initial experiments, increasing amounts of α-CD were added to a methyl orange solution. The solution initially had two large absorption peaks at 320 and 507 nm, and the intensity of the peak at 507 nm decreased with the increasing α-CD concentration. This decrease reflects insertion of methyl orange into the hydrophobic cavity of α-CD, which decreases the proportion of the methyl orange exposed to the system and causes the absorbance of the entire reaction system to decrease. The relationship between the decrease in absorbance and complex formation can be assessed using the Benesi-Hildebrand equation (equation (1)) (Yang, Liu, Mu, & Guo, 2001): (1) C MO Δ A = 1 C CD · Δ ε · K d + 1 Δ ε In this formula, CMO represents the concentration of methyl orange; ΔA is the change in absorbance (the absorbance of methyl orange at the maximum absorption peak before the α-CD addition minus the absorbance after the addition of α-CD); CCD represents the concentration of α-CD; Δε represents the change in extinction coefficient (the extinction coefficient of methyl orange at maximum absorbance minus the extinction coefficient of the complex); Kd represents the binding constant. By plotting CMO/ΔA versus 1/CCD, Kd and Δε could be obtained from the slope and intercept of the line obtained using a linear regression analysis. In this case, there was a good linear relationship between CMO/ΔA and 1/Cα-CD, confirming that methyl orange and α-CD form a 1:1 inclusion complex. 2.2.4.1 α-CD and alcohols The binding constants of α-CD with a series of alcohols were determined using an established method (Connors et al., 1992) with minor modifications. Briefly, stock solutions containing 0.3 mM methyl orange and 3 mM α-CD were prepared in 0.1 M HCl. Samples (1 mL) of the methyl orange solution and varying volumes of the α-CD solution were mixed and diluted with 0.1 M HCl to a final volume of 10 mL (Yang et al., 2001). After thorough mixing, the samples were allowed to stand at 25 °C. 0.1 M HCl was used as a blank control. The absorbances at maximum absorption wavelength (λ max) were determined using an A560 UV–visible spectrophotometer (AOE Instruments Co., China). Subsequently, mixtures containing 2 mL of α-CD stock solution, varying volumes of alcohol and 1 mL methyl orange stock solution were diluted to 10 mL using 0.1 M HCl. 0.1 M HCl was used as a blank control. The absorbances of the solutions were measured as described above. 2.2.4.2 β-CD and alcohols The binding constants of β-CD and alcohol were determined using an established method (Skoulika, Georgiou, & Polissiou, 1999). The absorbances at λ max of indicator+β-CD samples and indicator + alcohol+β-CD samples were measured the same as in 2.2.4.1, with indicator being 0.3 mM phenolphthalein solution, β-CD being 3.0 mM β-CD solution and buffer being 0.1 M Na2CO3–NaHCO3 solution (pH 10.5). 2.2.5 Statistical analysis All experimental results were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) (n = 3). Statistical analyses were carried out with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Tukey procedure using the statistical package from SPSS Inc., USA. Means with different letters within the same rows of the tables are significantly different (p < 0.05)."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Effects of alcohol complexing agents on enzymatic α-CD production,"3.1 Effects of alcohol complexing agents on enzymatic α-CD production 3.1.1 Linear saturated monohydric alcohols The yields of α-, β- and γ-CD, and the overall CD in the presence of different concentrations of linear saturated monohydric alcohols are presented in Table 1 . In each case, the total CD yield (percentage of maltodextrin substrate converted to cyclodextrins, by weight) and the α-CD yield were positively correlated with the alcohol concentration. For example, addition of 8, 16, 24, and 32 mM 1-pentanol increased the total CD yield by approximately 1.9-, 2.3-, 2.5- and 3.0-fold, respectively, while increasing the α-CD yield by approximately 3.5-, 4.6-, 5.2-, and 6.0-fold, respectively. At constant alcohol concentration, the total CD yield and the α-CD yield increased with increasing number of carbon atoms. For example, the presence of 16 mM methanol, 1-propanol, 1-pentanol and 1-heptanol increased the total CD yield by approximately 1.1-, 1.7-, 2.3-, and 2.6-fold, respectively, while increasing the α-CD yield by approximately 1.2-, 2.9-, 4.6-, and 5.3-fold, respectively. Interestingly, the increase in α-CD yield was greater than the increase in total CD yield in all cases, suggesting that α-CD was becoming a greater proportion of the total CD yield. The effects of linear monohydric alcohols on the proportions of the α-, β- and γ-CD in the product mixture are presented in Fig. 1 A. In the absence of added alcohol (i.e. in the blank control), the proportion of β-CD is substantially greater than that of α-CD, which is substantially greater than that of γ-CD. Addition of methanol or ethanol increased the proportion of α-CD at the expense of γ-CD, but the proportion of β-CD remained greater than that of α-CD. Addition of linear monohydric alcohols containing three to eight carbon atoms increased the proportion of α-CD to the point that it was present in the greatest proportion (approximately 60% at 32 mM alcohol concentration). Finally, addition of 1-decanol or 1-dodecanol increased the proportion of α-CD to its highest levels (79% and 75%, respectively, at 32 mM alcohol concentration). Under these conditions, the proportion of γ-CD was negligible and the remainder of the mixture consisted of β-CD. 3.1.2 Branched-chain monohydric alcohols The yields of α-, β- and γ-CD and the overall CD yield in the presence of different concentrations of branched-chain monohydric alcohols are presented in Table 2 . Although addition of 8 mM–32 mM concentrations of any of the alcohols increased the total CD yield and the α-CD yield, correlations between alcohol concentration and either total CD yield or α-CD yield were not uniformly seen. There were also no consistent correlations between total CD yield or α-CD yield and the number of carbon atoms present in the alcohol, even after segregating the alcohols into groups of primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols. There were, however, two observations worthy of note. First, alcohol addition decreased the proportion of γ-CD in the product mixture in all cases. Second, there was an interesting correlation only consistently seen with the secondary alcohols (2-propanol, 2-butanol, cyclohexanol and 2-octanol). With these alcohols, the fold increase in α-CD yield was greater than the fold increase in β-CD at all concentrations tested. Grouping all of the monohydric alcohols by number of carbon atoms and comparing their effects on α-CD yield at each concentration tested, it could be seen that: for alcohols with three carbons, 1-propanol provided a greater enhancement than 2-propanol (1-propanol > 2-propanol); for alcohols containing four carbons, 1-butanol > 2-butanol > 2-methyl-1-propanol > 2-methyl-2-propanol; for alcohols containing five carbons, 1-pentanol> 3-methyl-2-butanol > 2-methyl-2-butanol; and for alcohols containing eight carbons, 1-octanol > 2-octanol. In each case, their effects on β-CD yield ranked in the opposite order. Thus, for alcohols with a given number of carbon atoms, branching decreased α-CD selectivity. This point was perhaps more clearly seen by considering the effects of branched-chain monohydric alcohols on the proportions of α-, β-, and γ-CD in the product mixture (Fig. 1B). When comparing alcohols with the same number of carbon atoms, increased branching decreased the proportion of α-CD, increased the proportion of β-CD, and had a minor effect on the proportion of γ-CD in the final product. For example, ranking the four-carbon alcohols 2-butanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol and 2-methyl-2-propanol according to the proportion of α-CD in the overall product gave the order: 2-butanol > 3-methyl-2-propanol > 2-methyl-2-propanol at all concentrations tested. This order was inverted when considering the proportion of β-CD. Thus, a decreased degree of branching was beneficial for α-CD selectivity, and the type of CD produced was influenced by the molecular structure and the molecular size of complexing agents. 3.1.3 Diols The effects of diols on the enzymatic production of CDs are presented in Table 3 . While the addition of diols could enhance the overall CD yield, there were no clear correlations between α-CD yield and diol concentration or number of carbon atoms in the diol. However, it was clear that 1, 4-butanediol, 1, 5-pentanediol and 1, 6-hexanediol increased α-CD production, with the highest α-CD yields being 24.12%, 18.58% and 18.75%, respectively. The effects of diols on the proportions of α-, β-, and γ-CD in the product mixture are presented in Fig. 1C. When comparing each diol to the monohydric alcohol with the same number of carbon atoms, it was clear that the additional hydroxyl group did decrease the α-CD selectivity of the reaction. This phenomenon might be caused by the complex molecular structure of the diols, which were relatively polar molecules that might have difficulty binding to the relatively small hydrophobic cavity of α-CD. Thus, the selectivity of enzymatic CD production appeared to be influenced by both the size and polarity of the complexing agent. In summary, linear saturated monohydric alcohols improved the α-CD selectivity of enzymatic CD production better than either branched-chain monohydric alcohols or simple diols containing the same number of carbon atoms. Moreover, when comparing monohydric alcohols with the same number of carbon atoms, those with increased branching were less conducive to α-CD production."
6,Binding constants of CDs with alcohols,"3.2 Binding constants of CDs with alcohols Addition of alcohol (ROH) to the methyl orange–α-CD inclusion system sets up two competitive equilibria, in which the alcohol and methyl orange compete as guests for the internal cavity of the α-CD. Thus, added alcohol displaces some of the methyl orange in the hydrophobic cavity of α-CD, and the methyl released into the acidic environment increases the intensity of the absorption peak. Since neither the α-CD nor the α-CD–alcohol complex absorb light at the wavelength used in the measurement, the spectral change reflects the change in the methyl orange–α-CD equilibrium. Therefore, the binding constant (K) of the inclusion complex formed by α-CD and alcohol could be calculated with the following equations (Sarkar, Barman, & Nath Roy, 2018; Kurkov & Loftsson, 2013; Loftsson & Brewster, 2012): (2) ∝ = ∝ 0 − Δ A / Δ ε C = K d ( ∝ 0 − ∝ ) / ∝ (3) K = C 0 − ∝ 0 + ∝ C ⋅ C G where ∝ is the equilibrium concentration of methyl orange; ∝ 0 is the total methyl orange concentration; ΔA, Δε, and Kd are as defined in equation (1); C is the equilibrium concentration of α-CD; C0 is the total α-CD concentration; and CG is the equilibrium alcohol concentration. The binding constants describing formation of alcohol–α-CD complexes are presented in Table 4 . Methyl orange does not form a complex with β-CD that is useful for determining the binding constants of competitive guests. However, phenolphthalein forms a 1:1 inclusion complex with β-CD under alkaline conditions. Complex formation converts phenolphthalein from the purple-red dianion to a colorless lactone structure, which causes a useful change in the UV spectrum (Sasaki, Christian, & Tucker, 1990; Yoshida, Shirai, & Fujimoto, 1989). Therefore, phenolphthalein was used to determine the binding constants that describe the formation of alcohol–β-CD inclusion complexes (Skoulika et al., 1999). The binding constants determined using this method are presented in Table 4."
7,The correlation between the inclusion stabilities and the effects of alcohol complexing agents on the preparation of CDs,"3.3 The correlation between the inclusion stabilities and the effects of alcohol complexing agents on the preparation of CDs Since the formation of an inclusion complex was determined not only by chemical factors (Brinker, Walla, Krois, & Arion, 2015), but also by the sizes of host cavity and guest, the sizes of the alcohols used in this study were calculated using Chem Office Ultra v8.0 software (Cambridge Soft Co., USA). The sizes calculated in this manner (length and diameter) are presented in Table 4, alongside the binding constants. 3.3.1 Linear monohydric alcohols As shown in Table 4, the binding constants of the complexes formed between linear monohydric alcohols and both α-CD and β-CD increased with the increasing alkyl chain length. The ratio of the binding constants of 1-decanol and methanol was approximately 1000 for α-CD, but only approximately 55 for β-CD. From the perspective of the size matching, the molecular diameters of the linear monohydric alcohols were around 0.45 nm, while the lengths increased by about 0.11 nm with each additional methylene group (–CH2–) until they reached a maximum of approximately 1.2 nm. The stereochemical structure of α- or β-CD is conical with an average molecular cavity height of 0.8 ± 0.01 nm. The smaller port is composed of the primary hydroxyl groups at the C-6 position, while the larger port is composed of the secondary hydroxyl groups at the C-2 and C-3 positions. The reactivities of these three hydroxyl groups show significant differences: C-6 ≥ C-2 > C-3 (Kobayashi, Kainuma, & Suzuki, 1978). Therefore, it is speculated that the inclusion is driven by the hydrophobic effect. Alcohol as a guest molecule is pulled by the hydrophobic alkyl chain from the small port to the cavity bottom of CD, and the hydroxyl group of the alcohol is connected to the hydroxyl group at the C-6 position by forming a hydrogen bond at the inner side of the small port (Yang & Yang, 2020). The formation of hydrogen bonds plays an anchor-like role, which makes the guest alcohol molecules fixed at the small port of CD. This process not only inhibits the free movement of the alkyl chain in the CD hydrophobic cavity, but also enhances the stability of the inclusion complex. Thus, although one might expect linear alcohols with less than 7 carbon atoms to form inclusion complexes by becoming embedded in the cavities of α- or β-CD, the inclusion with α-CD were significantly more stable than those with β-CD. This suggests the cavity diameter of α-CD (0.47–0.53 nm) is more closely matched with the diameter of linear monohydric alcohols than the cavity diameter of β-CD (0.6–0.65 nm). Since this appears to be the case, molecular matching appears to have an important influence on the formation of inclusion complexes, as presented in Fig. 3 . Comparing the binding constants with the fold-increases in CD yield gives very different results with α-CD than with β-CD. To perform this comparison, the binding constants and the alcohol concentrations should be firstly used to estimate the percentage of CD product present as an inclusion complex, and then compared that with the percentage of maximal enhancement observed. The results of this analysis at 32 mM alcohol concentration are presented in Fig. 2. In this analysis, the enhancement of CD yield provided by 1-octanol was used as the value for 100% enhancement because the data for 1-decanol or 1-dodecanol were clearly more complex, especially for β-CD. These data show that >99% of the α-CD produced in the presence of 1-heptanol and larger alcohols was present in an inclusion complex, and the increase in α-CD yield correlated well with the increase in inclusion complex formation. In contrast, the data show that only approximately 96% of the β-CD produced was present as an inclusion complex, and the increase in β-CD yield did not correlate well with inclusion complex formation. This analysis is consistent with complex formation being a major component of α-CD yield enhancement, while other effects must be invoked to explain the increase in β-CD yield, as well as its precipitous decrease with 1-decanol and 1-dodecanol. 3.3.2 Branched-chain monohydric alcohols The binding constants of branched-chain monohydric alcohols with α-CD and the molecular sizes of branched-chain monohydric alcohols are shown in Table 4. As described in Fig. 3, comparing alcohols with the same number of carbon atoms, addition of a branching methyl group, either at the alpha or beta carbon, decreases the α-CD binding constant, but increases the β-CD binding constant. Adding a second methyl group to the alpha carbon to form a tertiary alcohol has mixed effects, 2-methyl-2-propanol has an α-CD binding constant greater than that of 1-butanol, while 3-methyl-1-butanol has an α-CD binding constant smaller than that of 1-pentanol. In both cases, however, the β-CD binding constant is greatly increased. This trend continues with cyclohexanol, and 2-octanol, which have much greater affinity with β-CD than with α-CD. With 2-octanol, in particular, this result is quite opposite the effect seen with 1-octanol, which has much greater affinity with α-CD than with β-CD. Clearly the branched alcohols interact in a more productive way with the larger hydrophobic cavity present in β-CD. This is somewhat counter-intuitive, since the calculated diameters of these molecules (0.31–0.52 nm; Table 4) seem small enough to fit in the α-CD cavity (0.47–0.53 nm). It is speculated that unlike the linear monohydric alcohols, only part of the hydrophobic alkyl chains of the branched-chain monohydric alcohols are embedded in the cavity of CD. Alcohols with more branching methyl groups possess greater volume and steric hindrance, which makes them much easier to be included in β-CD with larger cavity diameter, instead of α-CD. This suggests that the formation of inclusion complexes is not only decided by the matching of molecular size between alcohols and CDs, but also affected by the stereoscopic effect of the guest molecule. Comparing the percentage of complexed CD present at 32 mM alcohol concentration with enhancement of α-CD yield did not produce a correlation among the branched-chain monohydric alcohols as it did among the primary alcohols, even when limiting each correlation to alcohols with similar branching types but differing numbers of carbons (data not shown). A similar comparison with β-CD yield produced a very modest correlation. 3.3.3 Diols The binding constants of α- and β-CD with diols are shown in Table 4. The binding constants increased with increasing number of carbon atoms in the diol, and the binding constants for α- and β-CD were very similar. These diols, which are polar and strongly hydrophilic, had relatively low binding constants with α- and β-CD, and the differences in affinity for the two complexes were small. It can be due to the presence of two hydrophilic hydroxyl groups which make it difficult for diols to enter the hydrophobic cavity of CD, but can only form weak hydrogen bonds with the primary and secondary hydroxyl groups of the ports. Despite these low binding constants, which suggest a relatively small fraction of the CDs produced are actually in complex with the diol, all of the diols are able to increase the overall CD yield and for butanediol in particular, increase α-CD selectivity. These results indicate that forces other than complex formation are important for both the increase in total CD yield and the increase in α-CD selectivity. (Garcia-Rio, Hervés, Leis, Mejuto, & Pérez-Juste, 2006)."
8,Conclusion,"In this study, the effects of linear saturated monohydric alcohols, branched-chain monohydric alcohols and diols on the preparation of α-CD were investigated and compared by measuring the overall CD yields, the α-, β-, and γ-CD yields, and the binding constants of their inclusion complexes. The results revealed that all of the alcohols tested were able to increase overall CD yield, and many were able to increase the proportion of α-CD in the product mixture which depended on the inclusion interaction between the alcohols and CDs. It is worth noting that a correlation between the formation of inclusion complexes and the increase in α-CD yield could only be demonstrated for the linear saturated monohydric alcohols. Linear saturated monohydric alcohol with >8 carbon atoms were best able to increase α-CD selectivity, suggesting complexing agents that increase α-CD selectivity through complex formation may provide access to the most useful compounds. These results provided theoretical basis for the choosing of complexing agent in the preparation of α-CD, which was important for expanding the applications of α-CD in the food industry."
