0,Introduction,"Over a few decades, the growing global population has contributed to high energy demand, especially with fossil fuels, which will trigger some environmental challenges such as high greenhouse gas emissions, climate changes, air pollution, and the ecological system's degeneration [1,2]. Since the industrial revolution in the 18th century, fossil fuel dependency has contributed to unsustainability global development. Exploring alternative fuels is getting attention concerning energy security, global warming, and the crude oil price crisis [3,4]. The second-generation biofuel (or advanced biofuel) derived from edible and non-edible sources, including residual biomass lignocellulose, non-edible essential oil components, and waste feedstock, can be used as a fossil fuel's alternative [5–8]. Waste cooking oil (WCO) offers a promising feedstock to overcome existing shortcomings despite helping in WCO disposal management and did not compete as a food source [2]. As long as the food industry runs, it will produce WCO. Annually, it is estimated that about 16.54 million tons (Mt) of WCO are produced out of the biggest producing countries and regions, including the United States of America, Taiwan, Canada, China, Malaysia, Japan, and Europe [9]. Converting WCO to advanced biofuel such as diesel will address the environmental pollution and energy security issues. Triglycerides of WCO consist of oxygenated fatty acids composition, which are suitable to be converted to hydrocarbon fuels. Two main reactions involved in removing the oxygen are; decarboxylation (DCX) and decarbonylation (DCN) reaction. DCX reaction removes oxygen by producing CO₂ with single bond C–C, while DCN reaction creates double bond C=C, CO, and H2O [3]. It is crucial to develop a dedicated and active catalyst to increase the product's yield and selectivity. Mesostructured (2–50 nm) catalysts are favored in liquid phase conversion reactions because they provide better effective adsorption between reactant-catalyst surfaces, thereby enhancing the reaction. Previous literature has discussed that using mesoporous silica SBA-15 as catalyst support could promote better catalytic activity by offering small pore size distribution and large pore volume [10]. Various metal catalysts such as pure metals, metallic mixtures, metal phosphide, metal oxide, and metal carbide have been used widely to increase the deoxygenation reaction and the hydrocarbon yield products [11]. Nevertheless, metallic mixtures (bimetallic, trimetallic, or metallic admixture) have gained attention as they exhibit different electronic and physical properties from their parent metal, enhancing their catalytic performance [12,13]. In addition, [14] reported that among Co, Fe, Cu, and Mn, Ni-Co bimetallic catalyst has appeared as an excellent bimetallic combination that promotes deoxygenation and introduces excellent thermal stability. The acidity properties of catalyst support, SBA-15, also influence the efficiency of the decarboxylation activity. The higher the acidity of the catalyst support, the higher the influence on the reaction of hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis [15]. The mesoporous structure of SBA-15 promotes the efficiency of the deoxygenation process [16]. Thus, considering the interaction of mesoporous SBA-15 and the synergetic effect of bimetal, we aim to unlock the potential of WCO as a renewable feedstock in diesel production through heterogeneous catalytic deoxygenation reaction systems in this article. Combination series with selected metal-loadings (5, 10, 15 %) of Ni-Co, Co-Fe, and Ni-Fe catalysts have been prepared to understand the impact and catalytic performance on product yield and selectivity."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials In this study, the analytical reagents were used without any further purification. Pluronic P123 (triblock copolymer poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol, Mav = 5800), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, C8H20O4Si, >98%) and 2 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 99%), cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 99%) and iron (II) nitrate hexahydrate (Fe(NO3)2·6H2O were obtained from R&M company. Absolute ethanol (95%) from Fisher Scientific was also used. The WCO feedstocks were collected from local restaurants in the Bangi area and were filtered to remove the impurities."
3,"Synthesis of catalyst supporter, SBA-15","2.2 Synthesis of catalyst supporter, SBA-15 SBA-15 was synthesized through the Zhou method [3,17]. 4 g of Pluronic P123 was allowed to dissolve in 30 ml deionized water by continuous stirring at 40 °C, followed by 120 ml HCl, and the mixture was stirred for 1 h. Then, 8.5 g TEOS was added to the mixture and stirred for 24 h at 40 °C. The mixture was transferred into a PTFE bottle and left in the oven for aging at 80 °C for 24 h. The solid product was obtained by filtration and washed with ethanol before drying overnight at 80 °C in an oven. The sample was then calcined at 500 °C for 5 h with a ramping rate of 1.5 °C min−1 for template removal."
4,Preparation of bimetallic catalyst,"2.3 Preparation of bimetallic catalyst A series of bimetallic catalysts were prepared with selected metal loadings. Ni-Co/SBA-15 was prepared by the wet impregnation method with slight modification [18]. 1 g of SBA-15 was dispersed in an ethanolic solution, followed by the addition of the required amount of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (5,10 and 15%) and a fixed amount of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (20%). The solution was stirred for about 3 h at room temperature. Then, the solution was continuously stirred and was heated slowly at 80 °C until a milky suspension appeared. The solution was then dried for 18 h at 80 °C, then calcination at 550 °C for 5 h. The same procedure was applied to prepare Ni-Fe/SBA-15 (5, 10, 15% of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O: 20% of Fe(NO3)2·6H2O and Co-Fe/SBA-15 (5, 10, 15% of Co(NO3)2·6H2O: 20% of Fe(NO3)2·6H2O)."
5,Catalyst characterization,"2.4 Catalyst characterization The synthesized SBA-15 support and the solid acid catalysts were characterized using low-angle and wide-angle powder X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis to identify their crystalline phases. The data was collected from low-angle XRD in 2θ range of 0.05–10° with a scan speed of 2°/min; wide-angle XRD in 2θ range of 10–90° with a scan speed of 2°/min. The porosity of the prepared SBA-15 and catalysts were characterized using nitrogen physisorption by ASAP Micromeritics 2020 instrument. The solid material was degassed at 150 °C for 2 h before the nitrogen gas adsorption–desorption was run at −196 °C to remove unknown gases and moisture from the catalysts. The physisorption analysis will determine the surface area, pore size, and pore volume using Brunauaer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) algorithms. An X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) instrument was used to identify the elemental composition and metal loading for each synthesized catalyst. The XRF (Bruker S8 Tiger) instrument was equipped with a rhodium tube and operated at 4 kW, while the catalysts were analyzed without any pre-treatment. The catalysts' acidity was determined by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD-NH3) by Thermo Finnigan TPD/R/O 1100. In the analysis, the catalysts must be pre-treated by N2 gas flow for 30 min at 250 °C, followed by NH3 gas for 1 h at ambient temperature. The NH3 desorption was detected under Helium gas flow with 30 ml/min in the range between 50 °C and 900 °C, and the acidity of the catalysts was obtained from the NH3 desorption peaks area [19]. The chemical functional groups of prepared catalysts were determined by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The analysis was run by a NICOLET 380 FTIR spectrometer in the range of 4000–600 cm−1. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) is a technique used to analyze the morphological characteristics of nanomaterials. The solid acid catalysts were analyzed by TEM (200 kV, FEI Tecnai F20 Super-Twin) to provide images of the catalysts' atomic structure. By coupling TEM to energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), the elements' mapping and composition (Ni, Co, Fe) could be determined."
6,Catalytic deoxygenation,"2.5 Catalytic deoxygenation The WCO was converted to advanced biofuels via a solventless and hydrogen-free catalytic deoxygenation reaction in a combined system with a 250 ml semi-batch reactor in a heating mantle equipped with reflux and nitrogen gas flow. The DO reaction was carried out using 10 g of WCO as the reaction feedstock in the presence of series metal-loaded catalysts (5, 10, 15% for each Ni-Co, Ni-Fe, Co-Fe/SBA-15). The reactor was then allowed to flow with nitrogen gas for 30 min to ensure the reaction was run in an inert atmosphere. The temperature was increased to 350 °C with approximately 50 cm3/min nitrogen flow rate while the mixture was continuously stirred for 2 h. After 2 h of reaction, the reactor temperature was allowed to cool until it reached room temperature before the nitrogen flow was stopped. The liquid hydrocarbons product was collected and further analyzed using GC-FID."
7,Product compositions analysis,"2.6 Product compositions analysis The final liquid products obtained from the deoxygenation were analyzed using an HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm, 0.25 µm). The liquid hydrocarbon product mixtures were diluted with n-hexane (GC grade), and about 2 µL of the sample was injected into the GC column. The internal standard used was 1-bromohexane, and the composition of the deoxygenated liquid product was identified by comparing them with the standard calibration curves of n-alkanes (C8-C20) [18,19]. From the GC-FID analysis, each synthesized catalyst's catalytic performance can be determined by comparing the retention time of desired diesel and gasoline product with the hydrocarbon standard (C8-C17) as Equation 1–3.

8,Results and discussion,
9,Physicochemical properties of the catalysts,"3.1 Physicochemical properties of the catalysts The low-angle and wide-angle XRD pattern of synthesized bimetallic catalysts, Ni-Co/SBA-15, Ni-Fe/SBA-15, and Co-Fe/SBA-15 illustrated in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 . The low-angle XRD pattern (Fig. 1) shows a well-defined diffraction peak of (100) at around 1 –1, 2°, confirms the two dimensional p6mm hexagonal arrangement structure of the parent SBA-15 supports retained after the impregnation process, and these also verifies that SBA-15 support is thermally stable [17,20]. The decreased intensity of the (100), (110), and (200) reflections, particularly for the Ni-Co/SBA-15 catalysts, clearly shown in Fig. 1, are probably due to a slight change in the wall thickness and pore volume that occurs due to the bimetallic impregnation towards the SBA-15 pore structure [18,21]. It is deemed that the aggregation of bimetallic onto SBA-15 support has also contributed to the occurrences mentioned earlier. Nevertheless, the uniform pore size distribution of the SBA-15 mesoporous structure has limited the bimetal aggregation in the resulting synthesized catalyst [18,22]. The crystalline structure and phase purity of the synthesized bimetallic catalyst is demonstrated by the wide-angle XRD pattern (Fig. 2). The broad peaks show at 20°–30° for all the synthesized bimetallic catalysts show the correlation to the framework of amorphous silica, SiO₂ [14]. The presence of NiCo2O4 diffraction peak at around 36.9°, 44.6°, 59.4°, 65.2° proved the effectiveness of the impregnation process at all series of synthesized Ni-Co/SBA-15 catalysts. At the same time, the occurrence of the cubic spinel phase of Co3O4 outcome from the calcination crystallizes in a cubic unit cell with similar lattice planes at both synthesized Ni-Co/SBA-15 and Co-Fe/SBA-15 catalysts [3]. The face-centered cubic crystalline Nickle oxide (NiO) (JCPDS 01-075-0197) exhibits in all series of both Ni-Co/SBA-15 and Ni-Fe/SBA-15 catalysts with similar intensity diffraction peak at all ranges of Ni wt.% [3,18]. Consequently, the impregnation of different Ni wt.% to both Ni-Co/SBA-15 and Ni-Fe/SBA-15 catalysts did not significantly affect NiCo2O4 and NiFe2O3 XRD diffraction peak intensity. The bimetallic catalyst of all Ni-Fe/SBA-15 and Co-Fe/SBA-15 series demonstrated the same characteristic peaks of the two phases of α-Fe2O3 and γ-Fe2O3 (JCPDS No. 033-0664) [23]. The Ni-Fe/SBA-15 catalyst crystallinity is proven by the NiFe2O3 diffraction peak simultaneous presence with α-Fe2O3, γ-Fe2O3, and NiO crystalline phase. [24]. In the Co-Fe/SBA-15 catalyst, the observed peak showed the same cubic crystalline phase of Co3O4 and CoFe2O4 exhibited in those catalysts [24,25]. The broader diffraction peak of Co-Fe/SBA-15 compared to other synthesized bimetallic catalysts suggesting better dispersion over the SBA-15 support [26]. All the N₂ adsorption–desorption isotherms of synthesized bimetallic catalysts and SBA-15 supports illustrated in Fig. 3 a exhibits a type IV isotherm, indicate high purity mesoporous materials with narrow size distribution pore sizes with non-intersecting mesopores. The synthesized bimetallic catalysts demonstrated an H1 hysteresis loop characteristically to the honeycomb-like mesoporous structures with a well-defined cylindrical pore channel [3,27–29]. The impregnation of bimetallic to the SBA-15 support did not alter the porous hexagonal structure. Furthermore, the BJH pore size distribution illustrated in Fig. 3b proved that the SBA-15 support and corresponding bimetallic catalysts possess high-intensity narrow pore size distributions typically similar around 5 nm verified by the average pore size tabulated in Table 1. However, the 5% and 10% of both Ni-Fe/SBA-15 and Co-Fe/SBA-15 catalysts have a small peak around 4 nm, and this is due to partial blockage of SBA-15 support pores with the corresponding bimetallic metal particles [3]. Moreover, those mentioned catalysts have earlier closing relative pressure of hysteresis loop (Fig. 3a) at around 0.5 indicates some of the metal nanoparticles are located in the SBA-15 pore channel consequence of the impregnation process [3]. As tabulated in Table 1 , SBA-15 has the largest specific surface area (697 m2/g) and an enormous pore volume (0.840 cm3/g). Introduction of Ni, Co, and Fe metal precursor into the SBA-15 framework affects it by decreasing the surface area and pore volume of synthesized bimetallic catalysts. In addition, the deposition of bimetallic and particle aggregation on the exterior SBA-15 mesoporous structure may partially block some pores, affecting the silica network strength and connectivity, as reveal in HRTEM images (Fig. 6). These factors contribute to the surface area and pore volume decrease of all synthesized bimetallic catalysts [10,30,31]. The elemental composition of the synthesized bimetallic catalysts was determined using the XRF analysis (Table 1). The Ni, Co, and Fe metal precursor percentage loading in the synthesized bimetallic catalysts is close to the expected value. These proved the effectiveness of the wet impregnation process in loading a definite amount of Ni, Co, and Fe metal precursor onto the SBA-15. Furthermore, the element mapping in EDS analysis (Fig. 7) revealed metal precursor dispersion in the synthesized bimetallic catalyst. The temperature-programmed through NH3 desorption (TPD-NH3) analysis can determine the synthesized bimetallic catalyst's acidity profile by measuring the area under every NH3 desorption peak to evaluate the total acid site (Fig. 4 and Table 1). The desorption peaks observed at the low-temperature (100–250 °C) are categories as weak acid properties, moderate acid (250–400 °C), while the desorption peaks above 400 °C show strong acid properties. The mesostructured catalyst support, SBA-15, exhibits low acidity, high surface area, and pore volume with tunable pore diameter, resulting in a synergic effect of active metal-support due to good dispersion of metal species on the catalyst support [32,33]. The introduction of Ni, Co, and Fe metals to the SBA-15 catalyst support promotes the Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites on the resulting bimetallic catalysts, affecting the overall total acidities [18,33]. Table 1 tabulated the total acidities were increasing in order of 10% < 5% < 15%, 10% < 15% < 5% and 15% < 5% < 10% for Ni-Co/SBA-15, Ni-Fe/SBA-15 and Co-Fe/SBA-15 catalysts, respectively. The strength of the catalyst's acidity could influence the catalytic activity in producing and hydrocarbon fuel selectivity, as shown in Fig. 8 [34]. These high acidic catalysts of 15% Ni-Co/SBA-15, 5% Ni-Fe/SBA-15, and 10% Co-Fe/SBA-15 proved by broad desorption peaks at above 900 °C suggest a high amount of Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites [18,19]. The average pore size before and after the metal species was impregnated indicating that the metals impregnation process did not obstruct or partially cover the pore surface. It is essential to ensure that the reactant can pass through and adsorb throughout the internal pores of the catalyst, thereby producing an effective reaction to produce the desired product. The FTIR spectra for analyzing the functional group of the synthesized bimetallic catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 5 . The overlapping of the OH stretching of the Si-OH is shown by the broad 3100–3600 cm−1 peak, and the small-signal centered at 1600 cm−1 is assigned to the bending vibration of adsorbed water bands [3,35]. This 3100–3600 cm−1 peak corresponds to the asymmetry OH stretching vibrations of Si-OH groups deposited at the framework of the SBA-15 mesoporous structure [35]. In that case, the intense peak of 15% Ni-Fe/SBA-15 catalyst may indicate low interaction between the Si-OH and Ni-Fe bimetallic at the framework of the SBA-15 structure [35]. The presence of either Si-OH or Si-O- stretching vibrations band around 973 cm−1 and the strong Si-O-Si bridge band at 1056 and 802 cm−1 confirmed the interaction of bimetallic and SBA-15 support did not disturb the SBA-15 framework structure [3,35]. HRTEM images in Fig. 6 showing the uniform ordered hexagonal structure of the SBA-15 support and the dispersion of bimetallic particles onto the catalysts support, SBA-15. Morphological properties of the synthesized bimetallic catalysts by the HRTEM images are in good agreement with a low-angle XRD pattern (Fig. 1) and N₂ adsorption–desorption analysis (Fig. 3). This analysis also proves that the loading of metal precursor through the wet impregnation process does not disrupt the hexagonal mesoporous structure SBA-15, thus confirming the remarkable stability of the prepared SBA-15 support [18]. The small dark on the HRTEM images indicates the bimetallic particles that are loading onto the SBA-15 support. The 15% Co-Fe/SBA-15 showed the most dispersion particles onto the SBA-15 structures, and these results aligned with the broad XRD peak pattern in Fig. 2. The uniform ordered hexagonal structures of SBA-15 support limited the aggregation of the bimetallic particles, ensuring the high dispersion metal particles, consequently optimize the catalyst activity [36]. The dissemination of bimetallic particles onto the catalysts support, SBA-15 further verified by the HRTEM-EDS chemical elemental mapping analysis. The EDS-HRTEM results depicted the homogenous distribution of Ni, Co, and Fe particles on the SBA-15 catalyst's support upon impregnation, and thus XRF analysis confirmed the wt.% of elemental in the synthesized bimetallic catalyst."
10,Deoxygenation activity of WCO,"3.2 Deoxygenation activity of WCO The catalytic activity of Ni-Co/SBA-15, Ni-Fe/SBA-15, and Co-Fe/SBA-15 bimetallic catalyst with different wt.% percentage (5, 10, 15) were studied in a semi-batch reactor for 2 h reaction through solvent-less DO reaction with a nitrogen flow gas atmosphere [3,19]. Initially, Gas chromatography (GC-FID) analysis was performed to analyze the fatty acids profile of WCO (Table 2 ). Fig. 7 demonstrated the possible reaction pathway of TAGs conversion of WCO via deoxygenation catalytic activities. The DCX route favors alkane products by removing oxygen to produce CO2, while the DCN route favors alkene products by removing CO and H2O [15,16]. The high temperature in deoxygenation reaction and high acidity catalyst may induce the hydrocarbon cracking producer short-chain/lighter C–C hydrocarbon [1,25]. An effective catalyst can remove oxygen during the deoxygenation reaction while minimizing or avoiding carbon loss during the carbon cracking to produce long straight-chain hydrocarbon [10]. Fig. 8 tabulated the hydrocarbon yield from the catalytic activity and hydrocarbon range selectivity of the resulting deoxygenated liquid product, revealing the high output of saturated and unsaturated straight-chain hydrocarbon consist of targeted diesel range n-(C11-C17) and gasoline range n-(C8-C10). A blank experiment over the free-catalyzed DO reaction revealed a relatively low hydrocarbon yield of 18%, mainly in the gasoline range selectivity around 74.6%. The shorter hydrocarbon chain in the gasoline range is induced by the thermal cracking of FFA in WCO [10]. The presence of Ni species on the synthesized bimetallic catalyst of Ni-Co/SBA-15 and Ni-Fe/SBA-15 significantly improves the overall catalytic activity with selectivity towards diesel formation. The 10% Ni-Fe/SBA-15 catalyst demonstrated the highest hydrocarbon yield (73%), but all wt.% of Co-Fe/SBA-15 showed low activity with 10% Co-Fe/SBA-15 catalyst confirmed the lowest hydrocarbon yield (14.3%). Previously, WCO has been used as a reactant under the same reaction condition reported a low hydrocarbon yield of 5% from the blank results over the free-catalyzed DO reaction [40]. The highest specific surface area of 10%Ni-Fe/SBA-15 among other synthesized bimetallic catalysts (Table 1), leading to this high catalytic activity. The high total acid site of 10%Co-Fe/SBA-15 (17900.60 µmol/g) and low Co-Fe bimetallic synergy might lead to the early catalyst deactivation, which snags the catalyst activity [40]. Nevertheless, Ni wt.% loading in both Ni-Co/SBA-15 and Ni-Fe/SBA-15 catalysts affects the diesel range selectivity. The results showing the selectivity towards diesel n-(C11-C17) fraction range decrease from 81% (5% Ni-Co/SBA-15) to 55% (15% Ni-Co/SBA-15), and Ni-Fe/SBA-15 catalyst also demonstrated the same decrease pattern of diesel range selectivity (59% to 39%). The catalyst's high acidity also promoted the cracking of long-chain C–C hydrocarbon bond to short-chain of a C–C bond. Fig. 9 illustrates the hydrocarbon fractions of advanced biofuel products; n-(C8-C10), n-(C11-C14), and n-(C15-C17). Higher selectivity towards n-(C15-C17) fraction is due to DCX/DCN reaction pathways, which are associated mainly with the FFA composition in WCO, palmitic acid (35.7%), oleic acid (41.6%), and linoleic acid (13.5 %). Fig. 10 . demonstrated the evaluation of n-alkane and n-alkene hydrocarbon yields of n-C15 product selectivity. The DCX reaction pathway was more favorable as it revealed 99–100% straight-chain alkanes dominantly present for both 10% and 15% series of Ni-Co SBA-15, Ni-Fe/SBA-15, and Co-Fe/SBA-15 bimetallic catalyst. The hydrocarbon fraction n-(C8-C10) and n-(C11-C14) were affected mainly by continued hydrocarbon cracking via C–C scission from the deoxygenated liquid of n-(C15-C17). In the early hour of deoxygenation reaction, the high temperature may affect long-chain FFA cracking, especially palmitic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic [18]. A high-temperature DO reaction system and the presence of a high acidic catalyst may induce both types of cracking. The C=C hydrocarbon bond presence in both oleic acid and linoleic acid might be contributed to those hydrocarbon cracking, produce high gasoline range selectivity comprise a high percentage of the shorter hydrocarbon chain, especially n-C8 and n-C9. Fig. 11 illustrated the carbon distribution of liquid hydrocarbon yield during deoxygenation of WCO in each carbon fraction (C8-C17). Although 10% Ni-Fe/SBA-15 produces the highest hydrocarbon yield in deoxygenated liquid (73.1%), the selectivity of diesel range is reasonably low (58.6%), especially in n-(C15-C17) fraction (41.5%). Despite 5% Ni-Co/SBA-15 hydrocarbon yield only 54.6%, but the highest selectivity towards diesel range (80.8%) with 64.3% in n-(C15-C17) fraction and has a more negligible effect on light hydrocarbon cracking n-(C8-C10), 10.1 %. Strongly acidic catalysts, specifically 5% Ni-Fe/ SBA-15 and 10% Co-Fe/SBA-15, show high selectivity towards short hydrocarbon, n-(C8-C10) fraction, taking significant effect from the long-chain FFA and hydrocarbon cracking. The chemical composition of the deoxygenated product (5% Ni-Co/SBA-15) was further analyzed by GC–MS analysis (see GC–MS chromatogram in the Supplemental Material). We use the NIST 11 (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Mass Spectral Database to get the best hit on the related mass spectra [43]. From the analysis (Fig. 12 ), it is confirmed that the deoxygenated product were mainly composed of both saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbon chains (C15 and C17); pentadecane (C15H32) 40.53%, heptadecene (C17H34) (17.98%) and heptadecane (C17H36) (5.27%). This result is in a good agreement with the GC-FID analysis that the 5% Ni-Co/SBA-15 exhibit the highest selectivity towards the diesel range fraction. The result is also compatible with the fatty acids profile of the WCO feedstock in this work (Table 2), which consisting of palmitic acid (35.7%) and oleic acid (41.6%) and proving that the deoxygenation reaction favors producing hydrocarbons via DCX or DCN by removing oxygen atom carboxylic acid group rather than cracking process [41,42]. Furthermore, the liquid product also showed the presence of non-oxygenated compounds; heavy hydrocarbon C21-C24 (0.9%) and oxygenated intermediates such as carboxylic acid (1.46%), alcohol (1.48%) and ketone (24.47%). From the GC–MS result, the presence of compounds that below C8 were detected, which are hexanoic acid (C6H12O2) (0.48%), 1,2-cyclopentanediol (C5H10O2) (0.48%) and cyclopentaneethanol (C7H14O) (1.0%). This finding strongly suggested that a complex process of triglycerides occurred during the cracking of fatty acids which results in the formation of alcohol intermediates [44]."
11,Conclusion,"Highly ordered bimetallic Ni-Co/SBA-15, Ni-Fe/SBA-15, and Co-Fe/SBA-15 with different metal loadings (5, 10, and 15 wt%) were effectively prepared using the wet impregnation method without disturbing the hexagonal mesoporous SBA-15 catalyst support. The highest specific surface area of 10% Ni-Fe/SBA-15 catalyst produces the highest hydrocarbon yield (73.1%) but suffers a low selectivity towards the diesel effect from the hydrocarbon cracking. Meanwhile, 5 % Ni-Co/SBA-15 proves the better catalyst in terms of high selectivity towards the diesel range (80.1%) with good hydrocarbon yield (54.65), mostly in the n-(C15-C17) fragment range. The deoxygenation reaction systems are generally derived from the synergistic effect between bimetallic synthesized catalysts. Furthermore, SBA-15 support enhances the deoxygenation reaction via DCX and DCN by a good distribution of bimetallic catalyst and minimizing the impregnation particles' agglomeration."
