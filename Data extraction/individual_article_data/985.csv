0,Introduction,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) is broadly revealed as the principal anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG). Carbon dioxide occurs typically as a component of the global carbon cycle; however, human activities have raised climatic loadings by burning petroleum products or fossil fuel and other sources of emission [1]. The industrial processes, natural-gas processing, and burning of petroleum derivatives (coal, oil, and natural gas) to create energy bring enormous amounts of GHG emissions to the atmosphere, generally in CO2 structures [2–5]. Carbon capture and storage (CCS), just as carbon capture and utilization (CCU), are believed to play a significant role in reducing the amount of released CO2 in the atmosphere [6–10]. The European approach determined to decrease 40% of GHG emissions by 2030 compared to emission levels recorded in 1990 [11,12]. Therefore, CO2 can be captured using adsorbents [13–16] and transformed into different chemicals. Fig. 1 shows the trend of CO2 emissions from the year 2010–2020. The increased CO2 emissions from 31,291.4 million tonnes (MT) in 2010–34356.6 MT in 2019 were observed, but the COVID-19 situation decreased its concentration to 32,284.1 MT in 2020. As in the COVID-19 situation, most works related to industrialization, vehicle movement, etc., were minimized; that is why there is a reduction in the peak of CO2 trend, as shown in Fig. 1. However, it is ensured that CO2 should be captured and transformed into something useful product such as ethanol which will be the main focus of study in this review. Fig. 2 shows the general CCU schematic pathway. The catalytic transformation of sequestrated CO2 to liquid fuels such as methanol [18–21], ethanol [22–24], and jet fuel [25] can improve worldwide climate change and decrease our enormous reliance on fossil fuels [26–29]. As carbon in the CO2 molecule has the highest oxidation state, its conversion requires enormous energy. Hydrogen (H2) is mainly utilized for enormous scale CO2 hydrogenation reactions [30]. The source of H2 primarily comes from the syngas, petrochemical plants, methane steam reforming, chlorine alkali plants, electrolysis process, and coke oven gas processes. Hydrogenation of CO2 is of high importance, which helps to ease the greenhouse effect induced by CO2 and gives an approach to turning CO2 into C1 building blocks [31–40]. Direct CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol, which serves as the chemical structure block, the energy transporter, and fuel added substance, has drawn much attention [41,42]. When blended with conventional gasoline, ethanol improves the octane rating [43]. Ethanol is also a greener fuel source as it releases a very low amount of pollutants during its combustion, such as CO and CH4, in the atmosphere as compared to conventional gasoline [44]. Apart from its use as a fuel, it is also used to manufacture drugs, plastics, lacquers, polishes, plasticizers, and cosmetics [45]. Brazil (28%) and the United States (59%), as shown in Fig. 3, have effectively and enormously carried out ethanol as a substitute fuel and have shown that it tends to be competitive with gasoline in terms of cost and energy [46]. The United States is the world’s biggest ethanol maker, having created over 13.9 billion gallons in 2020 [47]. Together, the United States and Brazil produce 87% of the world’s ethanol. In the United States, the gasoline market comprises 96% E10 (Ethanol:Gasoline::10:90 on a volume basis), and ethanol created from corn starch involves almost three-fourth of the biofuel delivered in the country. Its shortcoming is that ethanol is produced from a raw material utilized for food [48]. In the case of Flex Fuel Vehicles, E85 (Ethanol:Gasoline::85:15 on a volume basis) is used, depending upon the season and the geographic area [49]. Recently, much work has been performed for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol [50–53]. Comparatively, less work has been reported for ethanol or higher alcohol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation, yet ethanol is non-toxic and valuable, which can be easily transformed into a value-added product, i.e., ethylene. Ethanol is produced conventionally from molasses and corn, and cellulosic feedstocks such as crop residues and wood. However, due to the large number of crops required for ethanol synthesis, other alternative sources such as CO2 can be utilized. CO2, which is freely available in the environment, can be first captured, stored, purified, and transformed into ethanol. Nevertheless, the hydrogenation of CO2 into ethanol is a big task since CO2 is a thermodynamically stable and chemically inert molecule [54]. So, its conversion is low and requires high reaction temperatures for its reaction to occur (> 200 °C). Moreover, the ethanol production from the hydrogenation of CO2 is thermodynamically not favorable because of the generation of CH4 or CO, which reduces the ethanol selectivity [43]. At present, it is a big task to get high selectivity of ethanol by utilizing catalysts at significantly high CO2 conversion. New thoughts for the catalyst configuration are adopted to accomplish high ethanol selectivity from the CO2 hydrogenation [55–63]. Hence in this review, the authors have focussed on the reaction mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol and the various effects which might alter the ethanol productivity and CO2 conversions such as variation of temperature, time, CO2/H2 ratio, solvent, support, metal loading, space velocity, and catalyst. Lastly, stability and recyclability studies have been studied, which is an important aspect, as most industries tend to use the same catalyst for a longer time to avoid shutting down the process."
1,Reaction mechanism and studies based on CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol,"The reaction mechanism is a fundamental understanding of how any reactant is getting converted into a product, the intermediates formed, and the role of catalyst used. Generally, the hydrogenation of CO2 to ethanol follows the reaction steps as shown in Eqs. (1)–(3). Eqs. (1) and (2) are both exothermic and thermodynamically controlled. Therefore, the literature reports that the CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol should be performed at a low temperature (around 200 °C) to have a good conversion and selectivity [64]. During the process, a water gas shift (WGS) reaction also occurs (Eq. (3)), which is essential in affecting the equilibrium of CO and CO2 hydrogenation reactions. The reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction (reverse of Eq. (3)) can also occur, which partially reduces the CO2 into CO and is the source for ethanol synthesis. (1) CO 2 + 6 H 2 → C 2 H 5 OH g + 3 H 2 O g ; Δ H = − 173.7 kJ/mo l (2) 2 CO + 6 H 2 → C 2 H 5 OH g + H 2 O g ; Δ H = − 255.9 kJ/mol (3) CO + H 2 O g ↔ H 2 + CO 2 ; Δ H = − 41.1 kJ/mol Some researchers have depicted plausible reaction mechanisms discussed in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, divided into homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts."
2,Homogeneous catalysts,"2.1 Homogeneous catalysts 2.1.1 Batch reactor 2.1.1.1 Co-based catalyst Cui et al. [65] studied the Ru3(CO)12–Co4(CO)12 homogeneous catalyst, which displayed 87.5% of ethanol selectivity at 200 °C and 6 MPa. They proposed the reaction mechanism involving bis(triphenylphosphoranylidene)ammonium chloride (PNNCl) as the co-catalyst and lithium bromide (LiBr) as the promoter with the help of CO2 hydrogenation studies by checking the effect of LiBr, PNNCl, reaction temperature, and reaction time on the product selectivity. The hydrogenation of CO2 led to the production of CH3OH and CO via Ru catalyst, as shown in Step 1. The formed methanol undergoes hydrocarbonylation to form ethanol from Steps 2–5. The role of Co-species was to produce acetaldehyde (C2H4O) and ethanol by the hydrocarbonylation of methanol, while the bromide-promoted Ru catalyst further catalyzed the hydrogenation of acetaldehyde to ethanol. The synergy between PNNCl and Ru active centers improved the electron density of Ru metal, enhancing the oxidation state in Step 3. Also, this increase in electron density could facilitate the hydrogenation reaction in Step 5. Step 1 2 CO 2 + 3 H 2 → H 2 O + CO + C H 3 OH Step 2 C H 3 OH + LiBr → C H 3 Br + LiOH Step 3 C H 3 Br + Ru * → CH 3 Ru * Br Step 4 CH 3 Ru * Br + CO → CH 3 CO Ru * Br Step 5 CH 3 CO Ru * Br + H 2 → CH 3 CH 2 OH + HBr + Ru * Step 6 HBr + LiOH → LiBr → H 2 O where C H 3 Br , LiOH , Ru * , CH 3 CO Ru * , and HBr are bromomethane, lithium hydroxide, ruthenium metal species, acetyl group attached over Ru species, and hydrogen bromide, respectively. Wang et al. [66] performed the hydrogenation of CO2 to ethanol using Co0.52Ni0.48AlO x metal oxide catalyst. All reactions were performed at T = 200 °C, t = 12 h and obtained 85.7% ethanol selectivity. The reaction mechanism was proposed using in-situ DRIFTS experiments. First, CO2 gets adsorbed as carbonates and bicarbonates; then Ni species helped in the partial hydrogenation of CO2 into HCOO* intermediates. CH x * species were also identified, which are also the source of CO2 hydrogenation. The interaction between HCOO* and CH x * led to acetate, which finally formed ethanol. 2.1.1.2 Rh-based catalyst Qian et al. [67] studied the hydrogenation of CO2 into C2+ alcohols by Ru3(CO)12/Rh2(CO)4C12-LiI catalyst to achieve 47.3% of ethanol selectivity at 160 °C and 3 MPa. Lithium iodide (LiI) played an essential role in promoting the reaction rate and thus favored the formation of alcohols, especially ethanol. Without the LiI, only methanol formed, which signifies its importance towards the production of higher alcohols. LiI also helped in stabilizing the catalyst by acting as a barrier for coke formation. 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (DMI) as a solvent also enhanced the catalyst activity. Therefore, the combination of promoter and solvent significantly improved the catalytic activity and stability."
3,Heterogeneous catalysts,"2.2 Heterogeneous catalysts 2.2.1 Batch reactor 2.2.1.1 Cu-based catalyst An et al. [68] selectively produced a higher amount of ethanol up to > 99% at T = 100 °C and P = 2 MPa using metal-organic frameworks (Zr12-bpdc-CuCs). They proposed a reaction mechanism based on CO2 hydrogenation results performed by checking the behavior of different catalysts on the product selectivity. The activation of H2 occurred on the bimetallic Cu 2 active sites increasing the oxidation state of Cu from + 1 (Step 1) to + 2 (Step 2) and forming ( Cu 2 + − H − ) 2 . The CO2 is introduced (Step 3) and pairs the bond with two neighboring H − atoms and forms Cu 2 + − C H 2 O 2 , i.e., formic acid (Step 4). After this step, methanol is produced if the H2 spillover mechanism occurs; otherwise, the reaction will proceed to Step 5. In Step 5, the bond pair spilled with two Cu 2 + sites forming hydroxyl and formyl groups over different Cu sites ( Cu I 2 + and Cu II 2 + ). Further hydrogenation led to the production of methanol (Step 6). In the next step, the C − C bond formation occurs between the C of methanol and formyl ( CHO ), in which the formyl acts as a lewis base in donating extra electrons from its framework, hence forming acetaldehyde (Step 7). This acetaldehyde undergoes further hydrogenation via the H spillover mechanism and forming ethoxide ( C 2 H 5 O ) in Step 8 and finally produce ethanol (Step 9). Both the Cu 2 sites were then regenerated via the reductive elimination step. 2.2.1.2 Pd-based catalyst Bai et al. [61] studied Pd–Cu nanoparticles catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol. The ethanol selectivity was increased to 92% over Pd2Cu NPs/P25 at T = 200 °C. They proposed the plausible reaction mechanism with the help of DRIFTS experiments in which it was found that the conditions and catalyst that they incorporated led to the formation of HOCO * (formate intermediates). It was found that Pd-Cu NPs cannot easily dissociate the C = O bond in the CO2 activation at the initial step. The HOCO * species breaks apart into CO * and HO * . Further hydrogenation led to the formation of CHO * species. Then continuous hydrogenation of CHO * species then eventually produced ethanol: CH 2 OH * → CH 2 → CH 3 → C 2 H 5 O → C 2 H 5 OH . 2.2.1.3 Co-based catalyst Wang et al. [62] studied CoAlO x catalyst (Co-Al oxides calcinated at 600 °C) in the CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol and showed 92.1% ethanol selectivity at 140 °C and 4 MPa and concluded that lowering the reduction temperature reduced activity and ethanol selectivity significantly. Also, from FTIR studies, it is noticed that formate intermediates are not hydrogenated owing to good stability, and thus hinders the methanol formation. In contrast, these intermediates get converted into acetate species which is an important intermediate for ethanol synthesis. Zhang et al. [68] recently performed ethanol synthesis from CO2 using a series of CoMoC x catalysts. Based on this, CoMoC x -800 showed the best ethanol selectivity of 97.4% at T = 180 °C and P = 2 MPa. With the help of in-situ DRIFTS experiments, the activation of both H2 and CO2 produced the formyl species via HCOO * species. This, in turn, forwarded the C − C step and eventually formed ethanol as the primary product. This way, ethanol synthesis can be performed via non-noble metal catalysts. 2.2.1.4 Au-based catalyst Wang et al. [69] performed the direct CO2 hydrogenation into ethanol using Au nanoclusters doped over titania as support. At the conditions of T = 200 °C, P = 60 bar for 10 h, the highest ethanol selectivity of > 99% was achieved with a yield of 942.8 mmol gAu -1 h-1. The synergy between the Au nanoclusters and anatase-TiO2 helped in achieving such a high ethanol selectivity/yield. The various CO2 hydrogenation experiments performed, such as the effect of solvent, reaction temperature, H2:CO2 ratio, and Au loading, and the use of some relevant literature [59,70,71], helped identify the possible reaction mechanism. The pathway leads directly to the CO insertion step, where CO2 gets hydrogenated into CH3* species and then, after CO insertion via RWGS, forms CH3CO*. After successful hydrogenation steps, it leads to ethanol formation. Also, the catalyst had high stability, as there is no leaching of Au or Ti observed in the product as confirmed by ICP-AES analysis. 2.2.1.5 Ir-based catalyst Ye et al. [70] performed the CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol using Ir1-In2O3 single-atom catalyst and achieved a high ethanol selectivity of 99.7%. They also proposed the reaction mechanism with the help of in-situ DRIFTS experiments, as shown in Fig. 4. First, the CO2 gets adsorbed on the In metal site as CO 2 * , and then the CO2 activation starts by converting CO2 into CO on the Ir metal site. The formed Ir δ + − CO * intermediate could play a significant role in the generation of ethanol. The Lewis acid-base pair’s effect on CO2 activation was also favored over the Ir-In2O3 catalyst. According to theoretical calculations and infrared spectra, a Lewis acid-base pair develops between the monatomic Ir and the nearby oxygen abundance on In2O3, generating two different catalytic sites that decrease CO2 to active intermediates and promote C − C coupling to generate ethanol. During the hydrogenation conditions, the CHO * is formed from the CO, while the CO2 gets hydrogenated into an important CH 3 O * intermediate. Further hydrogenation produces the C 2 H 5 O * species on the Ir metal sites. This species finally, after hydrogenation, produces ethanol as the product. 2.2.2 Continuous flow reactor 2.2.2.1 Cu-based catalyst Ding et al. [71] synthesized Cu@Na-Beta catalyst, which showed superior performance in producing ~ 100% ethanol selectivity on the organic product basis, while no methane or other alcohol was produced. The reaction was performed at T = 300 °C, P = 1.3 MPa, and GHSV = 12,000 mL gcat -1 h-1 with 0.1 g of catalyst. The catalyst was tested for 100 h reaction time, and it showed excellent stability, which is also evident from TEM images, i.e., its particle size remains the same both before and after the reaction. The Cu nanoparticles get highly dispersed and embedded into mesopores of the Na-Beta support, thus ensuring the catalyst’s stability because this enveloping of Na-Beta on the Cu nanoparticles hinders the formation of side products. XANES spectra confirmed that the CuO is reduced to metallic Cu, which are the active species. Also, the irregular shape of the Cu nanoparticles and the close relationship between the Cu and the support is the reason for better catalytic activity, as evident from XPS and Cu LMM Auger spectra. The mechanism involved in ethanol formation is studied using DFT (density functional theory) and slab model calculations. The two crucial steps involved in ethanol synthesis are surface methyl generation and C − C coupling. The hydrogenation of CO2 first occurs to form CH3*, and then the available adsorbed CO2 reacts with CH3* species to form CH3COO* , which is suggested as the key intermediate. This CH3COO* intermediate cannot desorb due to the high energy barrier and thus will further hydrogenate to form ethanol. It is also deduced that methyl species can also be formed from methanol because no methanol is formed in the product. Xu et al. [39] investigated the role of promotors in the production of C2+OH from CO2 hydrogenation at T = 330 °C, P = 5 MPa, and WHSV = 4500 h-1. The CO2 conversion of 36.6% and ethanol yield of 1.12 mmol gcat -1 h-1 is achieved using a Cs-CuFeZn catalyst. The reaction mechanism is proposed with the help of in-situ DRIFTS experiments and the ASF (Anderson−Schulz−Flory) plot. There are two reaction pathways, one via the formate pathway and the other via the CO insertion pathway. Cu/ZnO helps in the formation of methanol via the formate pathway. However, in the CO insertion pathway, the Cs promotor restricts the methanol formation. High temperature favors the RWGS reaction, thereby generating CO via Cu/ZnO interaction and Cu-Fe carbide catalyzes CHO* formation, and further Cs promote the CO insertion reaction and eventually generate higher alcohols. Recently, Wang et al. [72] observed the reaction mechanism towards the ethanol synthesis from CO2 with Cs/Cu/ZnO( 000 1 ̅ ) catalyst, as shown in Fig. 5. They performed DFT calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulation to identify the possible intermediate for ethanol synthesis. It was observed that Cs/Cu/ZnO( 000 1 ̅ ) catalyst greatly enhances the CO2 activation to CO and CO hydrogenation pathways. The hydrogenation of CO to CHO * towards ethanol synthesis is an important step. The CHO * intermediate undergoes C − C coupling and forms the important species which lead to ethanol as the final product: C 2 H 2 O 2 * → C 2 H 3 O 2 * → C 2 H 4 O 2 * → C 2 H 3 O * → C 2 H 4 O * → C 2 H 5 O 2 * → C 2 H 5 OH . 2.2.2.2 Co-based catalyst Zheng et al. [73] studied Co/La-Ga-O catalyst for the synthesis of ethanol via CO2 hydrogenation at T = 240 °C, P = 3 MPa, and GHSV = 3000 mL gcat -1 h-1. The high activity of the catalyst was obtained with an ethanol content of 88.1% in the alcohol mixture. The addition of Ga inhibited the generation of CH4, promoted ethanol formation, and reduced coke deposition. The sintering was also not observed as the mean size of Co particles before and after the reaction remains nearly the same, calculated using H2-TPD results and observed from TEM. For reaction chemistry, the CH3 * species is the key intermediate that forms on the Co0 sites. Further CO insertion and C − C coupling steps can then lead to the formation of ethanol. Also, the interaction of Co and La turns some Co sites into Coδ+ sites. The synergy between Co and Coδ+ reduces the hydrogenation ability of Co0, thereby hindering the CH4 formation and promoting ethanol. In contrast, Ga in the Co/La-Ga-O catalyst stabilizes the Coδ+ active sites. Zhang et al. [76] studied Al2O3, ZnO, AC, TiO2, SiO2, and Si3N4 supports over Co2C catalyst for the CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol. Na-Co/SiO2 produced an ethanol selectivity of 62.8%, displaying high catalytic stability in CO2 conversion and ethanol selectivity during the testing period of 250 °C and 5 MPa for 300 h. After achieving more extended catalyst stability, they proposed the stability mechanism ( Fig. 6(a)) based on a different support role with the help of XRD, BET, XPS, and Raman characterizations. During reduction and reaction, the CoO phase gets converted into the Co2C phase as confirmed using XRD. However, this phase remains stable only over SiO2 and Si3N4 during the reaction. Hence, the Co2C phase played an essential role in ethanol formation, while CH n formation is due to the metallic Co phase. From XPS, it was evident that electron charge transfer occurred from Co2+ to supports, thus leading to stabilized Co − O − Si bonds formation, improving Co-C bond strength, and thus stabilizing Co2C for 300 h. Also, with the help of In-situ DRIFTS, using Na-Co/SiO2 catalyst, the CO2 was decomposed into CO with the RWGS reaction, and the support (having Co − O − Si framework) provided sufficient active sites to hydrogenate the CO molecule and produce the intermediate CH 3 O * , which is the key ingredient for ethanol synthesis. Further, the produced CH 3 O * intermediate reacts with CO in the hydrogenation conditions, hence producing ethanol in the product. The formed CO during the reaction will help regenerate and reconstruct decomposed Co species back into Co2C, and this phenomenon will occur again and again, thereby improving the overall catalyst stability for high reaction times. An et al. [22] also synthesized Co/La-Ga-O catalyst and checked its catalytic performance at T = 270 °C, P = 3 MPa, and GHSV = 3000 mL g-1 h-1. They proposed a reaction mechanism (Fig. 6(b)) based on the different experimental studies (effect of pressure and time on CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol) and characterizations (XRD, BET, XPS, H2-and CO2-TPD) performed. The La4Ga2O9 and Co nanoparticles interacted with each other to form Co0-Co2+ active sites. The adsorbed CO2 is converted into CO due to the higher rate of RWGS reaction on La4Ga2O9 support. The formed CO finds difficulty in desorbing from the support, as evident from CO2-TPD results. Then the CO gets migrated from the support to Co nanoparticles and hence increases the RWGS reaction. The CO then over Co0-Co2+ sites produces alcohols and so the ethanol. However, increasing reaction time reduces the ethanol selectivity and thereby promotes methanol because of the increase in the ratio of Co0-Co2+, as confirmed from XPS. Zhang et al. [23] performed the CO2 hydrogenation reaction at T = 310 °C, P = 5 MPa, and WHSV = 6000 mL gcat -1 h-1 using Na-Co/SiO2 catalyst. High CO2 conversion of 53.2% and the ethanol selectivity of 52.8% (out of 12.9% of total alcohol). The synergy between the Na and the Co2C was formed by optimizing the Na content. Also, this relationship formed Na − Co2C stabilized active sites during the reaction. The ethanol yield increased due to the highly dispersed Co2C species and reduced particle size, increasing the RWGS reaction rate. The CO gets un-dissociative adsorbed on the active sites and cannot desorb due to higher energy barrier, and thus, it helped regulate the ratio of CO/CH x , and further CO insertion led to ethanol production evidenced from DFT calculations. Higher Na loading tends to adsorb CO too strongly, increasing CO selectivity, while low Na loading produces optimal ethanol yield. Thus, the interaction between active and alkali metal can be tuned to design complex catalysts. 2.2.2.3 Pd-based catalyst Caparrós et al. [75] reported the use of Pd modified over Fe3O4 with Pd single atoms for the hydrogenation of CO2 to ethanol at T = 300 °C, P = 1 atm, and WHSV = 60 L gcat -1 h-1. The selectivity of 97.5% was reported with high activity of 413 mmolEthanol gcat -1 h-1 using 0.1 wt%Pd. While high temperatures, i.e., > 300 °C, lowered the ethanol selectivity and enhanced the CO and propanol selectivity. Fe3O4 support helps activate CO2 to CO due to the RWGS reaction, while the Pd helps further C − C coupling reactions. Also, no methane was generated even at higher reaction temperatures (i.e., 350 and 400 °C). The Pd single atoms, which are also confirmed using HAADF-STEM micrographs, improved the ethanol selectivity. The Pd single atoms were converted into Pd nanoparticles due to their agglomeration at the higher reaction temperature, partially deactivating the catalyst and lowering the ethanol selectivity. Lou et al. [24] performed the hydrogenation of CO2 into ethanol at T = 240 °C, P = 3 MPa, and GHSV = 3000 mL gcat -1 h-1 using Pd dimers supported over CeO2. This catalyst showed high ethanol selectivity of 99.2%. No higher C2+alcohols were produced owing to the unique Pd2O4 configuration of Pd dimers. A new strategy is adopted for the construction of atom-precision active sites. Further, they also proposed the reaction mechanism based on DFT calculations ( Fig. 7). It is based on a series of reaction steps that can be comprised of a) CO2 activation, (b) CO activation, (c) C-O bond scission, (d) step-by-step hydrogenation, and finally (e) C-C coupling. In the initial step, the Pd dimers easily dissociate CO2 into CO without incorporating HCOO (formate) and COOH (carboxyl), as required a higher energy barrier. The adsorbed CO finds it difficult to get desorbed due to the high energy barrier (2.91 eV), and thus it gets hydrogenated into CHO. Also, adsorbed CO does not dissociate into C and O owing to the high energy barrier (3.38 eV). Then further C − C coupling pathways led to ethanol formation, and after that, it gets desorbed from Pd dimers. The ethanol desorption is endothermic with 0.47 eV of energy barrier. It should also be kept in mind that the methanol reaction step is not kinetically favored and hence is not produced. It was because CH 2 OH * species were not further hydrogenated but rather were dissociated, so according to the conditions, the dissociation step is favored due to the low energy barrier. Lastly, CH3 * species do not hydrogenate into CH4, while coupled with CO, to form CH3CO, thereby no methane formation. 2.2.2.4 Rh-based catalyst Yang et al. [76] exhibited the important role of surface hydroxyls over the Rh-based catalysts supported on TiO2-NRs (nanorods) catalyst to produce ethanol via CO2 hydrogenation. A 2.5 wt% RhFeLi/TiO2 NRs provided 32% ethanol selectivity at T = 250 °C and P = 30 atm. They also proposed a plausible reaction mechanism. In-situ DRIFTS experiments concluded the generation of CHO * is the rate-limiting step for the CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol pathway. The methanation step is not favored due to its stabilization by abundantly available hydroxyl groups on the RhFeLi/TiO2 NRs catalyst, while the CHO * due to thermodynamics gets dissociated into CH x * rather than CO. Further hydrogenation steps led to the formation of methoxide ( CH 3 O ). Then the scission of CH 3 * and O * in methoxide occurs due to the protonation of methanol, thereby reducing the energy barrier for the C−O bond's scission. Then CO (obtained from RWGS) insertion occurs in the CH 3 * species, leading to CH 3 CO * , which on consecutive hydrogenation steps proceed towards ethanol: CH 3 CO * → C 2 H 4 O * → C 2 H 5 O * → C 2 H 5 OH * → C 2 H 5 OH . Wang et al. [77] studied Rh-VO x /MCM-41 catalyst to achieve 21.2% ethanol selectivity at T = 250 °C and P = 3 MPa. These investigations gave a quantitative assessment of the relationship between active interfacial sites and catalytic performance in CO2 hydrogenation over multifunctional Rh-VO x /MCM-41 catalyst that has never been proposed. It was demonstrated that the promotion of VO x on Rh/MCM-41 contributed to the electronic effect that induced the generation of Rh+ species and the formation of interfacial VO x -Rh active sites. In-situ DRIFTS experiments helped in identifying that CH3 * species are the key intermediates for ethanol formation. Goryachev et al. [78] in their work reported the low ethanol selectivity of 16%, with higher CH4 in the product mixture, thereby decreasing ethanol selectivity at T = 250 °C and P = 5 MPa using 2 wt%K-20 wt%Fe-5 wt%Rh/SiO2 catalyst. Two roles of K metal were identified, i.e., it suppresses the methanation route, which is undesired and improves the CO dissociation pathway, leading to ethanol formation. Zhang et al. [79] performed the synthesis of Na+ promoted Rh/Silicalite-1 (Na-Rh@S-1) and checked its performance in the CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol. The reaction was performed at T = 523 K, P = 5 MPa, and GHSV = 6000 mL gcat -1 h-1, and it was observed that this catalyst showed good performance based on conversion (10%), selectivity (24%), and yield (72 mmol gRh -1 h-1). The confinement of S-1 support towards Rh nanoparticles provided two advantages, i.e., Firstly, it helped reduce the particle size, which improved its activity and increased the conversion of CO2. Secondly, the catalyst showed excellent stability till 100 h, and that is because of the confinement of Rh nanoparticles, which hinders sintering. As per the proposed reaction mechanism (via in-situ DRIFTS) as shown in Fig. 8., the non-dissociative ability of CO over the Rh+ site led to the formation of HCOO* , and further hydrogenation produced methanol. While Rh0 sites dissociated adsorbed CO, followed by hydrogenation, and C − C coupling reaction, forming ethanol. Hence, the catalyst should be synthesized to suppress the generation of formate species that leads to methanol and methane formation from the hydrogenation of CO2 or directly produces CO as an intermediate from the CO2 activation step, i.e., follows CO insertion pathway. The CH x * species has been regarded as the key intermediates for ethanol synthesis. Typically, these are some crucial steps that can reduce the formation of side products and enrich the ethanol selectivity to its maximum. Table 1 shows the study performed for the CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol using various catalysts with batch and continuous flow reactors."
4,Effect of process variables on the CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol,
5,Effect of reaction temperature,"3.1 Effect of reaction temperature Reaction temperature played a significant role in increasing the conversion of CO2, which is necessary to facilitate the CO2 activation leading to CO* as an intermediate, further producing CH x O*, which is an essential precursor for ethanol formation. As CO2 is chemically stable and kinetically controlled, it requires reaction temperature generally in the range of 200–300 °C to have higher selective ethanol in the product. 3.1.1 Low reaction temperature ( ≤ 200 °C) 3.1.1.1 Batch reactor Wang et al. [62] studied reaction temperature variation from 100° to 200°C over the CoAlO x -600 catalyst at H2:CO2 ratio = 3:1 and t = 15 h. It was found that ethanol selectivity increased from 78% (0.78 mmol g-1 h-1) to 92.1% (0.96 mmol g-1 h-1) at 100–140 °C. Further elevating the temperature to 200 °C reduces the ethanol selectivity to 88.9% (0.93 mmol g-1 h-1). It is due to the formation of methanol and propanol, which slightly reduces the ethanol selectivity at 200 °C. Hence a lower temperature of 140 °C was selected as the optimum reaction temperature. Bai et al. [66] investigated the Pd2Cu NPs/P25 catalyst by varying reaction temperature from 150 to 200 °C at H2:CO2 ratio = 3:1 and t = 5 h. The ethanol selectivity increased from 78.1% (10 mmol g-1 h-1) to 92% (41.2 mmol g-1 h-1) at 150–200 °C, respectively, indicating a high temperature was beneficial for CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol [61]. Wang et al. studied reaction temperature variation over Co0.52Ni0.48AlO x catalyst from 120° to 200°C at H2:CO2 ratio = 3:1 and t = 12 h. As the temperature increased from 120° to 180°C, the ethanol selectivity also increased from 77.8% (2.8 mmol g-1) to 86.4% (13.4 mmol g-1), respectively. When increased further to 200 °C, there was a minute decrease in selectivity to 85.8% (15.8 mmol g-1). The decrease in selectivity is due to more CO, CH4, and methanol at higher temperatures. Zhang et al. [80] varied the reaction temperature from 120° to 200°C by keeping the rest condition constant at P = 2 MPa and t = 6 h using CoMoC x -800 catalyst. As the temperature increases from 120° to 180°C, the ethanol selectivity also increases from 81% (0.025 mmol gcat -1 h-1) to 97.4% (0.528 mmol gcat -1 h-1), respectively. However, further enhancing the temperature reduced selectivity to 93% (0.71 mmol gcat -1 h-1). Methanol and higher alcohol yield increased at higher temperatures, thereby reducing the ethanol selectivity. 3.1.2 Mid-range reaction temperature (200 °C ≤ x ≤ 300 °C) 3.1.2.1 Batch reactor Qian et al. [67] used Ru3(CO)12/Rh2(CO)4Cl2–LiI catalyst by varying temperature from 180° to 220°C at H2:CO2 ratio = 4:4 and t = 12 h. Ethanol yield increased from 3.6 to 6 mmol L-1 h-1 from 180° to 200°C. However, as the temperature is increased further from 200 to 220 °C, the ethanol yield was slightly increased to 6.2 mmol L-1 h-1, but C3-C4 alcohol yield continuously increased at high temperatures. Ye et al. [70] varied the reaction temperature from 180° to 240°C at H2:CO2 ratio = 5:1 and t = 5 h using the Ir1–In2O3 catalyst. The ethanol selectivity remained constant from 180° to 200°C at 99.7%, while a further increase in temperature to 240 °C reduced it to 92.2% (1.44 mmol g-1 h-1). This shows that the reaction is kinetically controlled at a higher temperature, increasing methanol yield and reducing ethanol selectivity. 3.1.2.2 Continuous flow reactor Wang et al. [77] studied Rh-0.3VO x /MCM-41 catalyst by varying reaction temperature from 200 to 300 °C at WHSV = 6000 h-1, H2:CO2 = 3:1, and t = 12 h. The conversion of CO2 was 3.1% at 200 °C, which increased to 18.48% at 300 °C. This shows that CO2 conversion is kinetically favored. In contrast, the ethanol selectivity was increased from 7.74% to 24.1% at 200–250 °C, respectively. Further elevating the temperature decreased the selectivity to 10% at 300 °C. The reduction in the increase in CO selectivity shows that mostly CO2 gets converted to CO, and further CO hydrogenation to ethanol was restricted due to higher temperature conditions. Zheng et al. [73] tested LaCo0.7Ga0.3O3 catalyst for the variation of reaction temperature from 230° to 290°C at H2:CO2 ratio = 3:1, GSHV = 3000 mL gcat -1 h-1, and t = 18 h. As the temperature increased, the CO2 conversion was 5.6% at 230 °C and increased to 28.29% at 290 °C. On the other hand, the ethanol selectivity was 83.38% at 230 °C, significantly reducing to 40.5% at 290 °C. This indicates that high reaction temperatures from 250 to 290°C started producing methanol and CO as the side products. Hence the optimum temperature of 240 °C was considered with 10.1% and 80% of CO2 conversion and ethanol selectivity, respectively, considering side product formation at higher temperatures. 3.1.3 High reaction temperature ( ≥ 300 °C) 3.1.3.1 Continuous flow reactor Caparrós et al. [75] used 0.1 Pd/Fe3O4 catalyst for reaction temperature variation from 300 to 400 °C at H2:CO2 ratio = 4:1 and GHSV = 60 Lgcat -1 h-1. The increase in temperature from 300 to 400°C significantly reduced the ethanol selectivity from 97.5% to 17.8%. It was observed that high reaction temperature tends to promote CO selectivity as well as propanol. On the other hand, the overall conversion of CO2 increased from 0.3% to 3.9% with a temperature from 300 to 400 °C. This increase in conversion led to the formation of other side products. Xu et al. [39] studied the temperature variation over the Cs-C0.8F1.0Z1.0 catalyst. The temperature was varied from 260 to 330 °C at H2:CO2 ratio = 3:1, P = 5 MPa, GHSV = 15 mL min-1, and t = 3 h. It is observed that the CO2 conversion increases from 16.1% to 36.6% from 260 to 330 °C. In the case of ethanol yield, it was 11.3 mgethanol gcat -1 h-1 at 260 °C and increased to 51.6 mgethanol gcat -1 h-1 at 330 °C. Ding et al. [71] varied the reaction temperature from 200 to 350 °C by keeping the rest condition constant, i.e., P = 1.3 MPa and GHSV = 12,000 mL gcat -1 h-1 using Cu@Na-Beta catalyst. It was observed that increasing temperature improved the CO2 conversion from 0.85% to 12.2%. While CO started to form at 250 °C and its selectivity increased to 45.2% at 350 °C. Surprisingly, there was no effect on the ethanol selectivity throughout the temperature variation, and it remained 100% (among alcohols). This shows excellent catalytic activity of Cu@Na-Beta catalyst. Zhang et al. [23] studied the effect of reaction temperature on 2%Na–Co/SiO2 catalyst. The temperature was varied from 220 to 310 °C at WHSV = 6000 mL g− 1 h−1 and H2:CO2 = 3:1. The CO2 conversion gradually increased from 11.2% to 53.2% as temperature increased from 220 to 310 °C, respectively. Similarly, the ethanol selectivity first increased from 50% to 60% at temperature 220–250 °C, respectively, while later on, further increase in temperature reduced the selectivity to 52.5% at 310 °C. This shows that increasing temperature favors ethanol productivity."
6,Effect of H2:CO2 ratio,"3.2 Effect of H2:CO2 ratio The ratio of H2 to CO2 also favors the hydrogenation reaction and producing C1 to C4 alcohols. A definite proportion of H2 and CO2 should be used to avoid further hydrogenation of ethanol to C3-C4 alcohols, or a lower ratio helps in methanol synthesis routes. Since both routes are not favorable for higher ethanol synthesis, optimizing the H2:CO2 ratio is desired. 3.2.1 Batch reactor Qian et al. [67] performed the variation of the H2:CO2 ratio from 1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:4, 5:5, 6:2, and 2:6 at T = 200 °C and t = 12 h using Ru3(CO)12/Rh2(CO)4Cl2 as a catalyst. It was observed that the highest ethanol selectivity of 47.3% (6.09 mmol L-1 h-1) was obtained at a ratio of 4:4. Cui et al. [65] studied the H2:CO2 ratio variation from 1:2, 2:4, 2.25:6.75, 3:6, 4.5:4.5, and 6:3 using bimetallic Ru3(CO)12–Co4(CO)12 catalyst at T = 200 °C and t = 12 h. It was found that the highest ethanol selectivity of 87.5% was obtained at a ratio of 6:3. While when the ratio was kept at 3:6, there was a reduced selectivity of 73.4% (6.1 mmol L-1 h-1). This signifies that appropriate hydrogen pressure is necessary to have higher ethanol selectivity. Wang et al. [69] investigated the H2:CO2 ratio variation from 0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, and 5:1 at T = 200 °C and t = 10 h using Au/a-TiO2 catalyst. As the ratio is increased from 0.5:1–3:1, the ethanol selectivity remained nearly constant at 99% (944.4 mmol gAu -1 h-1). Further increasing the ratio to 5:1 gradually reduced the ethanol selectivity to 70% (589.7 mmol gAu -1 h-1). It is concluded that a higher ratio tends to hydrogenate ethanol, further leading to a reduced selectivity. 3.2.2 Continuous flow reactor An et al. [22] performed the H2/CO2 variation from 3:1, 4:1, and 5:1 at T = 270 °C, t = 12 h, and GHSV = 3000 mL gcat -1 h-1 using Co/La4Ga2O9 catalyst. It was observed that as the ratio was increased from 3:1–5:1, the CO2 conversion was reduced from 7% to 2%. While the ethanol selectivity gets reduced from 64% to 28%. The adsorption of CO and H2 competes for their adsorption over Co NPs, lower ratio favors the adsorption of CO over Co NPs and hence leading to improved ethanol selectivity. While higher ratio tends to promote the H2 adsorption over Co NPs, thus reducing the CO adsorption and lowering the ethanol selectivity while increasing the CO selectivity."
7,Effect of reaction time,"3.3 Effect of reaction time Reaction time is also another important parameter in the CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol. Generally, a slower reaction time is favorable, but not very low as it may produce less ethanol, while higher times eventually hydrogenate ethanol into C3-C4 alcohols or sometimes methanol due to reversible reaction. Optimization of reaction time is also necessary to have a higher amount of ethanol in the product. 3.3.1 Shorter reaction time ( ≤ 10 h) 3.3.1.1 Batch reactor Bai et al. [61] studied the reaction time variation from 0.5 to 10 h at T = 200 °C and H2:CO2 ratio of 2.4:0.8 using Pd2Cu NPs/P25 catalyst. It is noticed that ethanol selectivity increased from 50% (0.08 mmol) to 92% (1.16 mmol) at 0.5–5 h. After further increasing the time to 10 h, increased the ethanol selectivity to 93.4% (1.28 mmol). Hence the 5 h reaction time was chosen as the best condition for ethanol formation. Zhang et al. [80] varied the reaction time from 2 to 10 h at T = 180 °C and P = 2 MPa using CoMoC x -800 catalyst. It was observed that as the reaction time was increased from 2 to 10 h, the ethanol selectivity gradually increased from 94% to 98.5%, respectively. However, on the other side, the ethanol yield started to decrease after 6 h due to the formation of methanol and higher alcohols, eventually lowering the ethanol production rate. 3.3.1.2 Continuous flow reactor Yang et al. [76] checked the reaction time variation from 2.05 to 6.6 h at T = 250 °C and H2:CO2 ratio = 3:1 using 2.5 wt% RhFeLi/TiO2 NRs catalyst. The CO2 conversion was 18% at 6.6 h, while the ethanol selectivity increased from 30% to 35% from 2.05 to 6.6 h, respectively. The lower ethanol selectivity was due to the formation of CH4 and CO in the product. The presence of hydroxyl groups in large amounts favored ethanol formation to 35% at 6.6 h. Xu et al. [39] studied the reaction time variation from 1 to 30 h at T = 310 °C and H2:CO2 = 3:1 using Cs-C0.8F1.0Z1.0 catalyst. It was observed that CO2 conversion remained nearly constant at 30% till 30 h, while ethanol selectivity first increased from 44.5% (35.6 mgethanol gcat -1 h-1) to 47% (37 mgethanol gcat -1 h-1) from 1 to 5 h, and then with increasing the time to 30 h, gets reduced to 40.9% (32.5 mgethanol gcat -1 h-1). The reduction in the ethanol selectivity is due to the formation of methanol at higher reaction times. Ye et al. [70] performed the reaction time variation from 0.5 to 18 h at T = 200 °C and H2:CO2 ratio = 5:1 using the Ir1-In2O3 catalyst. It was observed that the ethanol selectivity first increased from 51.6% (0.02 mmol) to 99.7% (0.1 mmol) from 0.5 h to 5 h, and after that remained constant till the remainder of the duration (18 h). While the ethanol yield reaches a maximum of 2.1 mmol at 18 h. The ethanol selectivity remained constant due to low methanol formation. 3.3.2 Mid-range reaction time (10 h ≤ x ≤ 20 h) 3.3.2.1 Batch reactor Qian et al. [67] varied the reaction time from 1 to 24 h at T = 200 °C and H2:CO2 ratio = 4:4 using Ru3(CO)12/Rh2(CO)4Cl2 catalyst. It is observed that there was a linear increase in the ethanol from 0.019 to 0.131 mmol from 1 to 12 h. Further increasing the time to 24 h led to a reduction in the ethanol to 0.126 mmol. The reduction was mainly due to the formation of C3-C4 alcohols. Therefore longer reaction time tends to hydrogenate ethanol further into C2+ products. Wang et al. [66] investigated the time variation from 4 to 20 h at T = 200 °C and H2:CO2 ratio = 3:1 using Co0.52Ni0.48AlOx catalyst. It was found that the ethanol selectivity first increased from 76.6% (2.1 mmol g-1) to 85.8% (15.5 mmol g-1) from 4 to 12 h, and after that, it declined to 85% (26 mmol g-1) at 20 h. The reduction in selectivity was due to the formation of methanol at higher reaction times. 3.3.2.2 Continuous flow reactor Zheng et al. [73] performed the reaction time variation from 18 to 108 h at T = 240 °C, H2:CO2 ratio = 3:1, and GHSV = 3000 mL gcat -1 h-1 using LaCo0.7Ga0.3O3 catalyst. With increasing reaction time from 18 to 108 h, there is a continuous decrease in the ethanol selectivity from 51% to 13%. The decrease in the ethanol selectivity is due to the increase in the methanol selectivity with respect to time which is related to some Co particles getting oxidized to CoO with the help of either CO2 and/or H2O formed during the reaction. An et al. [22] investigated the time variation study from 12 to 44 h at T = 270 °C, H2:CO2 ratio = 3, and GHSV = 3000 mL gcat -1 h-1 using Co/La4Ga2O9. It was observed that 7% CO2 was obtained at 12 h, and it remained nearly constant till 44 h. In the case of ethanol, it keeps on decreasing from 64% to 38% at 12–44 h. The decrease in ethanol formation is due to the generation of methanol, which keeps on increasing with time. The reason is that CO is reacted over the La4Ga2O9 surface by which methanol is being produced, while the Co0-Co2+ sites are the ethanol formation sites. Hence CO should need to adsorb over Co sites to form ethanol in the product, but higher reaction times inhibit this step. 3.3.3 Longer reaction time ( ≥ 20 h) 3.3.3.1 Continuous flow reactor Zhang et al. [74] varied the reaction time from 21 to 296 h at T = 250 °C, H2:CO2 ratio = 3:1, and GHSV= 4000 h-1 using Na-Co/SiO2. With time increased from 21 to 42 h, the CO2 conversion and ethanol selectivity reached their maximum value of 18.8% and 62.8%, respectively. After further increasing to 296 h, the CO2 conversion and ethanol selectivity were reduced to 14.7% and 59.1%, respectively. Higher reaction times produce propanol and C5OH as the side products, significantly reducing the ethanol selectivity due to further hydrogenation. Zhang et al. [23] checked the influence of the reaction time variation from 25 to 100 h at T = 310 °C, H2:CO2 ratio = 3:1, and WHSV= 6000 mL g-1 h-1 using Na-Co/SiO2. It was observed that with an increase in reaction time from 25 to 50 h, the ethanol yield increased from 0.21 to 0.54 mmol g-1 h-1, while further increase in time to 100 h led to a decrease in ethanol yield 0.41 mmol g-1 h-1. This decrease in ethanol yield was due to the increase in CO selectivity. The CO was less adsorbed over Co sites than H2, leading to a decrease in the C-C coupling and hence lowering the formation of ethanol. While in the case of CO2 conversion, it decreased from 20.5% to 18.6% at 25–100 h. Both Ding et al. [71] and Zhang et al. [79] performed the stability analysis by varying the reaction time from 1 to 100 h. There was no change in ethanol selectivity/yield observed till 100 h. While in Ding et al. [71] case, ethanol (100%) was the only product found in the alcoholic mixture, in the case of Zhang et al. [79], both the conversion (~ 10%) and ethanol yield (72 mmol gRh -1 h-1) remained nearly constant. Table 2 shows the variation of process variables such as temperature, H2:CO2 ratio, and time on the hydrogenation of CO2 to ethanol process"
8,Effect of other variables on the CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol,
9,Effect of solvent,"4.1 Effect of solvent The solvent used in the CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol helps in facilitating the reaction towards a particular product. Few groups have performed the solvent variation in their studies. It was pointed out that some solvents hinder ethanol formation, creating the path for higher alcohols formation. In comparison, other solvents act as a transporter in transporting the reactant molecules to specific metallic sites. 4.1.1 Batch reactor Qian et al. [67] solvents such as DMI, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), 1-methyl-piperidine, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), Tetrahydrofuran (THF), cyclohexane, and water using Ru3(CO)12/Rh2(CO)4Cl2-LiI catalyst at H2:CO2 ratio = 4:4, T = 200 °C, and t = 12 h. The highest ethanol selectivity was obtained using DMI as the solvent of 47.3% (6.09 mmol L-1 h-1), while NMP and water give 20.9% (1.07 mmol L-1 h-1) and 6.2% (0.09 mmol L-1 h-1), respectively. With remaining solvents, no ethanol production was detected. One of the main reasons is that the catalyst was stable in DMI but not in most other solvents. Cui et al. [65] also tested different solvents using Ru3(CO)12-Co4(CO)12 bimetallic catalyst such as DMI, NMP, DMF, 1-Methylpiperidine, THF, Cyclohexane, water, and 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Bmim]-NTf2) at H2:CO2 ratio = 2:1, T = 200 °C, and t = 12 h. They also revealed that DMI solvent helped attain the higher ethanol selectivity of 87.5% (29.5 mmol L-1 h-1). This shows that the reaction was favored using DMI as the solvent, while others hindered the formation of ethanol to a large extent. Wang et al. [69] incorporated different solvents such as NMP, cyclohexane, DMF, THF, and water at H2:CO2 ratio = 3:1, T = 200 °C, and t = 10 h using Au/a-TiO2 catalyst. It was interesting that DMF solvent favors ethanol formation with a yield of 942.8 mmol gAu -1 h-1. DMF was the most suitable, exhibiting its distinct advantages for CO2 dissolution and acting as a “shuttle” for transporting the CO2 species between the surface defects of TiO2 and surface atoms of Au in the hydrogenation reaction. Wang et al. [62] studied water as the solvent with CoAlO x -600 catalyst and varied it from 1 to 4 mL at H2:CO2 ratio = 3:1, T = 140 °C, and t = 15 h. A run without solvent was performed, giving the ethanol selectivity of 64% (0.026 mmol g-1 h-1), which was low compared to the case of 1 mL solvent addition of 88.2% (0.35 mmol g-1 h-1). This shows that water as a solvent helps in the formation of ethanol. Further, as the solvent amount was increased from 1 to 4 mL, the ethanol selectivity reached a maximum of 91.4% (0.44 mmol g-1 h-1) at 3 mL, and further increasing to 4 mL led to a slight reduction to 90.2% (0.45 mmol g-1 h-1). The reduction in the ethanol selectivity is due to the formation of methanol and propanol at a higher solvent amount. In another study, Ye et al. [70] studied the variation of solvents at T = 200 °C, H2:CO2 = 5:1, and t = 5 h using an Ir1 −In2O3 catalyst. Different solvents such as DMF, water, DMI, cyclohexane, paraffin, and xylene were tested. It is observed that the highest ethanol selectivity of 99.7% (0.99 mmol g-1 h-1) was obtained with water as the solvent and the methanol formed was in trace amounts. Compared with DMF and DMI, the selectivity was 85.6% (0.24 mmol g-1 h-1) and 77.6% (0.15 mmol g-1 h-1), respectively. While rest solvents do not produce ethanol in the product. Hence, with water as a cheap source of solvent Ye and co-workers attained the highest ethanol selectivity of 99.7% compared to other research groups."
10,Effect of support,"4.2 Effect of support The catalytic activity is also determined using the type of support utilized in the CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol. The support provides thermal and mechanical stability to the catalyst nanoparticles. It also helps in lowering the mobility of the particles and therefore favors chemical stabilization. Only two studies were reported by the support variation performance in the CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol reaction. 4.2.1 Batch reactor Bai et al. [61] studied Pd2Cu NPs supported over various support such as SiO2, CeO2, Al2O3, and P25 at T = 200 °C, t = 5 h, and H2:CO2 ratio = 3:1. The ethanol yields for Pd2Cu NPs over SiO2, CeO2, Al2O3, and P25 supports were 14.8, 16.2, 19.7, and 41.5 mmol g-1 h-1, respectively. Pd2Cu NPs/P25 catalyst exhibited the best catalytic performance with maximum ethanol yield due to the presence of oxygen species over P25. The excellent selectivity was because of the transfer of charge among the Pd and Cu in the Pd2Cu NPs/P25 catalyst. 4.2.2 Continuous flow reactor Yang et al. [76] checked the variation of support for 1 wt%RhFeLi as the dopant at T = 250 °C, P = 30 atm, and GHSV = 6000 h-1. Various supports used were ZSM-5, SiO2, TS-1, Anatase TiO2, TiO2 NRs, TiO2 Com, ZrZnOx, ZnO, and ZrO2. It was found that the highest ethanol yield (1.3%) was observed in the case when TiO2 NRs were used as the support. Higher amounts of hydroxyl groups over the TiO2 NRs proved beneficial in ethanol productivity. Zhang et al. [74] studied Co2C catalyst by varying the support at T = 250 °C, H2:CO2 ratio = 3:1, GHSV = 4000 h-1, and t = 40 h. The CO2 conversion over supports such as Al2O3 (48.4%), ZnO (33.6%), AC (67.1), and TiO2 (63.6%) catalysts was higher as compared to SiO2 (18.8%) and Si3O4 (17.7%). The maximum conversion and ethanol selectivity were achieved over Na-Co/AC catalyst, but the methane formation was favored with low CO selectivity. Hence, SiO2 support has been considered the optimum support for the reaction conditions with CO2 conversion of 18.8% and ethanol selectivity of 62.8% (alcohol distribution)."
11,Effect of space velocity,"4.3 Effect of space velocity The effect of space velocity is another important parameter based on the retention time of reactant molecules with the catalyst. A higher space velocity generally results in low conversion due to lesser contact time, while low space velocity is mostly favored owing to higher retention time leading to more conversion of the reactant species. However, sometimes very low space velocity is also not considered as it may produce undesired products even though attaining higher conversion rates. Therefore, optimization is necessary for concluding the best space velocity condition in the CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol reaction. 4.3.1 Continuous flow reactor Wang et al. [77] performed the WHSV variation from 4000 to 12,000 h-1 at T = 250 ⁰C, H2:CO2 ratio = 3:1 and t = 12 h using Rh-0.3VO x /MCM-41 catalyst. As the WHSV is increased from 4000 to 6000 h-1, the CO2 conversion first increased from 26.5% to 28.2% and after that decreased to 16.5% at 12,000 h-1. This shows that higher WHSV reduces the contact time of reactant molecules with the catalyst, hence reducing the conversion. On the other hand, ethanol selectivity decreased from 29.2% to 20% at WHSV from 4000 to 12,000 h.1 Higher WHSV favors the formation of CO due to the passive effect of VO x species which hindered the Rh sites, and thus forming CO more in the product and also produces CH4 due to dissociation of CO. Hence an optimum WHSV of 4000 is well suited for higher ethanol selectivity. Ding et al. [71] varied the GHSV from 6000 to 18,000 h-1 at T = 300 °C and P = 1.3 MPa using Cu@Na-Beta catalyst. It was observed that increasing GHSV decreased the CO2 conversion from 13.5% to 3.7%, while CO selectivity increased from 26.9% to 35.9%, respectively. However, on the other hand, the ethanol selectivity remains constant throughout with 100% selectivity (among alcohols). Hence the Cu@Na-Beta catalyst shows superior performance even at higher GHSV. An et al. [22] studied the variation in the GHSV from 1500 to 7500 mL gcat -1 h-1 at T = 270 °C and H2:CO2 ratio = 3:1 using Co/La4Ga2O9 catalyst. As GHSV increased from 1500 to 7500 mL gcat -1 h-1, it lowered the CO2 conversion and ethanol selectivity (among alcohols) from 30% to 11% and 62–28%, respectively. Increased GHSV reduces the contact time for reactant species and catalyst active sites, therefore reducing CO2 conversion. In the case of ethanol selectivity, higher GHSV (> 3000 mL gcat -1 h-1) tends to flee the CO from the catalyst surface, thus reducing the formation of ethanol. Hence an optimum GHSV of 3000 mL gcat -1 h-1 was selected owing to less CH4 in the product than GHSV of 1500 mL gcat -1 h-1."
12,Metal doping/loading effect,"4.4 Metal doping/loading effect When loaded over support, the metal usually enhances the overall catalytic activity, which sometimes deteriorates the performance. The selection of metal oxide is essential for any catalytic process. Also, in the same way, the metal, when loaded over support with increasing weight percent, affected the reactant conversion and desired product selectivity, i.e., ethanol. Hence the metal loading needs to be optimized to ensure the formation of the selected product. 4.4.1 Batch reactor Cui et al. [65] performed the metal loading effect based on the Ru/Co ratio of 20/40, 30/30, 40/20, 45/15, 20/10, and 60/30. All reactions were performed at T = 200 °C, H2:CO2 ratio = 2:1, and t = 12 h using Ru3(CO)12–Co4(CO)12 catalyst. It was found that the ratio of 40/20 provided the highest ethanol selectivity of 87.5% (29.5 mmol L-1 h-1). While higher ratios tend to reduce the ethanol selectivity, implying that high Ru loading tends to affect the formation rate of ethanol and enhance methanol synthesis. Wang et al. [69] tested the variation in Au loading using Au/a-TiO2 catalyst at T = 200 °C, t = 10 h, and H2:CO2 ratio = 3:1. It was found that increasing Au loading from 0.2 to 3 wt% significantly reduced the ethanol yield from 942.8 to less than 125 mmol gAu -1 h-1. It was identified that the Au-catalyzed ethanol synthesis was a particle-size dependent reaction. Wang et al. [62] varied the Co content in the CoAlO x -600 catalyst from 1.31 to 3.87 wt% at T = 140 °C, t = 15 h, and H2:CO2 ratio = 3:1. As the Co content was varied from 1.31 to 2.72 wt%, a gradual increase in the ethanol selectively (among alcohols) was observed from 74.6% (0.08 mmol) to 92.3% (0.13 mmol), respectively. After further increasing to 3.87 wt% led to a slight decrease in selectivity to 88.6% (0.11 mmol). This concluded that Co content improves the catalytic performance while higher content suppresses the ethanol synthesis route, producing side products such as methanol and propanol. Bai et al. [61] varied the Pd content in the Pd2Cu NPs/P25 from 0.43 to 4.91 wt% at T = 200 °C for 5 h. It was observed that with increasing loading from 0.43 to 2.45 wt%, the ethanol selectivity increased from 78.7% (13.5 mmol g-1 h-1) to 96.1% (86.7 mmol g-1 h-1), respectively. Further enhancing the Pd wt% to 4.95 led to a decrement in the selectivity to 95.9% (103.5 mmol g-1 h-1). This shows that lower Pd loading benefited ethanol selectivity. Ye et al. [70] varied the Ir content in the Ir-In2O3 catalyst from 0.2 to 1 wt% at T = 200 °C, t = 5 h, and H2:CO2 ratio = 5:1. With increasing Ir content, the ethanol selectivity keeps on decreasing from 85.3% (0.92 mmol g-1 h-1) to 5.7% (0.13 mmol g-1 h-1) with 0.2–1 wt%. Increasing loading of Ir suppresses the ethanol synthesis and produces a higher amount of methanol. As the Ir loading increases from 0.5 to 1 wt%, the particles growth occurred from small-sized to agglomerated nanoparticles, which reduced the specific surface area and the key active sites and led to the downfall of ethanol in the product confirmed by SEM-EDX and TEM analysis. Also, increasing the Ir loading increased the reduction of In2O3, as confirmed by H2-TPR. 4.4.2 Continuous flow reactor Caparrós et al. [75] performed the metal doping from 0.1 to 3 wt% over Pd/Fe3O4 catalyst at T = 300 °C, H2:CO2 ratio = 4:1, and F/W = 60 L gcat -1 h-1. It was found that a lower loading of 0.1 wt% provided the highest ethanol selectivity of 97.5% with no other side products except a small amount of methanol. While higher loadings promoted the CO selectivity and reduced the ethanol formation rate, which is related to increased particle size due to agglomeration. Wang et al. [77] also performed the metal loading effect of VO x from 0.1 to 1 wt% in Rh-VO x /MCM-41 catalyst at T = 250 °C, H2:CO2 = 3:1, WHSV = 6000 h-1. The highest ethanol selectivity (among alcohols) of 24.1% was achieved at 0.3 wt% loading. At the same time, higher loading reduced both the CO2 conversion and ethanol selectivity. It is due to the passive effect caused by the high number of VO x species that encapsulate the Rh active sites. Zhang et al. [23] used Na-Co/SiO2 catalyst and varied the Na content from 0 to 5 wt% to optimize the metal loading at T = 250 °C, P = 5 MPa, and WHSV = 6000 h-1. As Na content increased from 0 to 2 wt%, an improvement was observed in the ethanol selectivity (among alcohols) of 60.6% (0.46 mmol g-1 h-1) and CO2 conversion 21.5%. In contrast, higher Na content (5 wt%) reduces ethanol yield and CO2 conversion. The Na favored the RWGS reaction and enhanced the CO coupling for ethanol synthesis. Lou et al. [24] varied the Pd loading from 0.1 to 2 wt% in the Pd/CeO2 catalyst at T = 240 °C, P = 3 MPa, H2:CO2 ratio = 3:1, and GHSV = 3000 mL gcat -1 h-1. The highest ethanol yield of 45.6 mgethanol gcat -1 h-1 was obtained with 0.13 wt% loading. However, further increment in the Pd loading to above 0.6 wt% led to a drastic reduction in the ethanol yield. Hence, it can be concluded that increasing the Pd loading generated by Pd agglomerates reduces the effective surface area of the catalyst and the main sites responsible for ethanol production. Zhang et al. [79] investigated the effect of metal loading of Na (0.13–0.26 wt%) in Na-Rh/Si-1 catalyst at T = 523 K, P = 5 MPa, and GHSV = 6000 h-1. It was observed that without Na in the catalyst, there was no ethanol formed in the product, which shows that Na and Rh interaction is desired in the selective production of ethanol. As the loading of Na was varied from 0.13 to 0.19 wt%, the ethanol selectivity increased from 18.44% (32 mmol gRh -1 h-1) to 24% (72 mmol gRh -1 h-1), respectively. In comparison, further enhancement in the metal loading reduced the selectivity to 16.5% (15 mmol gRh -1 h-1). This reduction is due to higher Na species, which covers most of the Rh+ sites, thus resulting in lower selectivity."
13,Effect of catalyst,"4.5 Effect of catalyst Generally, testing any process by different catalyst induces different results owing to different active sites available, effective surface area, pore structure, thermal and mechanical strength. Hence, optimizing various catalysts is very important for any chemical reaction in the desired reaction route. 4.5.1 Batch reactor Cui et al. [65] performed the variation in catalysts such as Ru3(CO)12-Co4(CO)12, Ru3(CO)12, Co4(CO)12, Ru3(CO)12-Co2(CO)8, RuBr3-CoBr2, and (PPh3)3RuCl2-(PPh3)3CoCl. All tests were performed at T = 200 °C, H2:CO2 ratio = 2:1 and t = 12 h. The highest ethanol selectivity of 87.5% was achieved using Ru3(CO)12-Co4(CO)12 catalyst. The synergistic effect between the Ru and Co active sites dominated the ethanol over other alcohols. Wang et al. [66] tested various catalysts such as CoAlO x , Co0.67Ni0.33AlO x , Co0.52Ni0.48AlO x , Co0.20Ni0.80AlO x , NiAlO x , Pt0.05/CoAlO x , and Pd0.05/CoAlO x at T = 200 °C, H2:CO2 ratio = 3:1, and t = 12 h. The Pt and Pd doped over CoAlO x showed an ethanol selectivity (among alcohols) of 75% (11.2 mmol gcat -1) and 74% (10.4 mmol gcat -1), respectively. At the same time, Ni-doped catalysts showed good results in Co0.52Ni0.48AlO x catalyst with an ethanol selectivity of 85.7% (15.8 mmol gcat -1), which is better than without Ni-doped CoAlO x catalyst. In the case of bare NiAlO x , the methanol was formed as the major product, and the ethanol selectivity was merely 14.25% (5.2 mmol gcat -1) which signifies that Co species is mainly responsible for the ethanol formation step. Ye et al. [70] performed catalyst variations at T = 200 °C, t = 5 h, and H2:CO2 ratio = 5:1 using Ir/In2O3, Ir/TiO2, Ir/ZnO, Rh/In2O3, Pt/In2O3, and Pd/In2O3. It was observed that the highest ethanol yield and selectivity were obtained using the Ir/In2O3 catalyst of 0.99 mmol g-1 h-1 and 99.7%, respectively. This catalyst showed good performance owing to its bifunctional nature. The In2O3 was available as the partially reduced form, while the Ir acts as the Lewis acid-base pair with neighboring oxygen on the support. This helped in CO2 activation into CO and then proceeded with C-C coupling. 4.5.2 Continuous flow reactor Ding et al. [71] used different catalysts such as Cu/SiO2, Cu/Na-Beta, Cu@Na-ZSM5, and Cu@Na-Beta at T = 300 °C, P = 1.3 MPa, and GHSV = 12,000 mL gcat -1 h-1. The Cu/SiO2 catalyst showed bad results, which are not significant as per the process because no ethanol was produced. It was recalled that a higher pressure is mandatory for ethanol formation using Cu/SiO2 catalyst. Cu/Na-Beta and Cu@Na-ZSM5 showed good results by having a high ethanol selectivity of 64.3% and 85%, respectively, and induced some methane and methanol in the product. In contrast, Cu@Na-Beta catalyst showed excellent results having 100% ethanol selectivity with 7.9% CO2 conversion. Yang et al. [76] checked different catalysts in their study, such as RhFeLi/TiO2 NRs-300–600 °C (here 300–600 °C represents the calcination temperature), RhFeLi/TiO2 Com (commercial TiO2), and RhFeLi/TiO2 NRs-CO (reduced under CO). All reactions were performed at T = 250 °C, P = 30 atm, and GHSV = 6000 h-1. The best catalyst was RhFeLi/TiO2-500, with the highest CO2 conversion (15.7%) and ethanol selectivity (among alcohols) of 31.3%. The high ethanol selectivity is regarded due to a higher amount of hydroxyls on the catalyst surface. Table 3 shows the variation of other variables such as solvent, support, space velocity, metal doping/loading, and catalyst, which are responsible for affecting the selectivity of ethanol."
14,Catalyst stability and recyclability studies,"Catalyst stability is another important criterion that needs to be focussed on in the case of any chemical reaction process. Eventually, if the catalyst provides higher desired product selectivity and reactant conversion, it is essential to maintain the catalytic activity with every reuse. Catalyst deactivation is another important phenomenon that usually occurs with catalyst due to interaction with the intermediate species formed during the reaction or the reaction conditions employed. Hence, to have an excellent catalytic ability, it must also show good reusability or recyclability by strengthening itself against the deactivation caused by coke formation, sintering, loss of active sites, etc. Some studies have been reported which performed stability or recyclability studies to check the catalytic activity in the CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol process."
15,Batch reactor,"5.1 Batch reactor Qian et al. [67] performed the recyclability study of the Ru3(CO)12/Rh2(CO)4Cl2 catalyst at T = 200 °C, P = 4 MPa, and t = 12 h. As the reaction proceeds from the 1st to 5th cycle, the ethanol yield did not show any noticeable change, and it remained around 6 mmol L-1 h-1, revealing that the catalyst was stable at this temperature for at least 60 h. Wang et al. [69] performed the recyclability analysis of Au/a-TiO2 catalyst at T = 200 °C, H2:CO2 ratio = 3:1, and t = 10 h. The ethanol selectivity remained constant at 98% after the 6th cycle, and it was concluded that the catalyst has excellent stability for ethanol synthesis. Also, when comparing the recycled catalyst with the fresh catalyst, no remarkable difference was observed from SEM analysis. However, on the other hand, the ethanol yield decreased with increasing recycling times from 942.2 to 843.6 mmol gAu -1 h-1 at 1 and 6th recycling times. The stability check shows that even though its selectivity remains constant throughout, its conversion keeps decreasing. Cui et al. [65] studied the recyclability of the bimetallic Ru3(CO)12–Co4(CO)12 catalyst at T = 200 °C, H2:CO2 ratio = 6:3, and t = 12 h. Ethanol yield was around 29 mmol L-1 h-1, respectively, and remained almost constant from 1 to 5 cycles. This indicates that the catalyst had excellent durability as well as recyclability. Bai et al. [61] investigated the stability of 1.23 wt%Pd2CuNPs/P25 catalyst by recycling 6 times at T = 200 °C, H2:CO2 ratio = 3:1, and t = 5 h. The ethanol selectivity increased from 89.6% to 92.2% from 1 to 6 times. After the 6th round, the ethanol yield remained as high as 38.4 mmol g-1 h-1. The catalyst maintained morphology, but the decrement of ethanol yield is mainly due to the loss of some amount of catalyst after each cycle. Wang et al. [62] performed the recyclability check over CoAlO x -600 catalyst at T = 200 °C, t = 15 h, and H2:CO2 ratio= 3:1. The yield of ethanol remained nearly constant at 0.43 mmol g-1 h-1 from 1 to 5 cycles. In terms of selectivity, it remained 90% after the 5th cycle. Therefore CoAlO x -600 catalyst exhibited good activity and selectivity as well as great stability. Ye et al. [70] studied the recyclability analysis of the Ir/In2O3 catalyst at T = 200 °C, t = 5 h, and H2:CO2 ratio = 5:1. The catalyst was checked for consecutive 4 cycles in which it was observed that the ethanol yield decreased sharply from 0.99 to 0.38 mmol g-1 h-1. It is concluded that the reason behind the decrease in the yield is the reduction of In2O3. It is also correlated with the formation of larger particles which lowered the catalytic activity by reducing the CO2 activation and the C-C coupling. Wang et al. [66] tested the recyclability analysis of Co0.52Ni0.48AlO x catalyst at T = 200 °C, P = 4 MPa, t = 12 h, and H2:CO2 ratio = 3:1. The recyclability was checked for 5 cycles. The study shows that the used catalyst provided almost constant ethanol selectivity and yield of ~88% and 15.8 mmol gcat -1, respectively. It is also found that after separating the catalyst at the end of each cycle, almost no metal leaching occurred. After the end of the 5th cycle, the catalyst does not show any changes compared to the fresh ones confirmed by SEM analysis. Thus it showed good catalytic stability at high temperatures and pressures. Zhang et al. [80] checked the reusability of CoMoC x -800 catalyst seven times at T = 180 °C and t = 6 h. It was found that with reusability times from 1 to 7, the ethanol selectivity remains constant at 97.5%, while ethanol yield slightly reduced from 0.528 to 0.481 mmol gcat -1 h-1. This shows that the catalyst had excellent durability to be reused seven times. Table 4 shows the loss in yield (%) during the recyclability studies performed by some researchers using batch reactors. It can be observed that Wang et al. [66] performed a total number of 5 cycles, and there was still no drop in the yield of ethanol observed, which signifies that the catalyst used was having excellent stability and activity. On the other hand, Ye et al. [70] show the highest drop in the ethanol yield to 61.6% after the 4th cycle."
16,Future perspectives and challenges,"CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol is performed mainly at high reaction temperature and pressure, as it is based on a series of reaction steps that can be comprised of (a) CO2 activation, (b) CO activation, (c) C-O bond scission, (d) step-by-step hydrogenation, and finally (e) C − C coupling. The current challenge in this research is the adoption of lower reaction conditions and, on the same side, increasing the CO2 conversion and ethanol selectivity/yield with the help of a suitable catalyst [78]. The effect of process parameters such as temperature, pressure, time, H2:CO2 ratio, solvent, support, metal loading, space velocity, and catalyst has been studied on the catalytic performance. The reaction mechanism is the key for identifying what possible intermediates are forming during the reactions. Many authors have provided plausible reaction mechanisms either via experimental studies [22,65,68,69,73–75] by using different variations in conditions and/or by adopting characterization techniques such as in-situ DRIFTS [39,61,70,76,77,79,80], FTIR [62,66], and DFT studies [23,24,71,72]. It has been found that CO2 first adsorbed as carbonates and bicarbonates on the catalyst surface [39,66,70,71,76,79,80]. Further, these species undergo a carbonylation reaction to form CO* . As per the literature adopted for this review article, the next step can be divided into two categories: formate and CO insertion. Mostly, the formate pathway leads to the formation of methane and methanol [79]. However, due to stable formate species, the hydrogenation reaction is not favored and will hinder the methanol formation [62,66]. While the CO insertion pathway deals with CO insertion in CHx * intermediates, consecutive C − C coupling leads to ethanol formation [24]. Here, the RWGS reaction plays an important role during the CO insertion pathway. Also, the role of catalyst here is crucial. The binding force between the CO and the active species on the catalyst needs to be strong enough to avoid the desorption of CO and dissociation of CO into C* and O* . The energy barrier needs to be high enough to suppress these pathways (CO desorption and dissociation). Lou et al. [24] depicted the effective role of Pd dimers in Pd/CeO2 catalyst by converting CO2 directly into CO without the formation of formate species, thus obtaining 99.7% ethanol selectivity. DFT studies identified that CO2 required higher energy to convert in HOCO, and thus it goes with less energy pathway, i.e., direct CO formation. On the other hand, Ding et al. [71] showed excellent results by obtaining only ethanol in the organic product using Cu@Na-Beta catalysts for 100 h. As per their mechanism using DFT studies, the formed methanol gets converted into methyl species, and CO insertion steps lead to ethanol as the only alcohol in the product. Therefore, such tools are quite helpful in identifying possible reaction mechanisms. For the discussion based on the catalysts, it is better to divide sections 7.1 and 7.2 into the batch and continuous flow reactors."
17,Batch reactor case,"6.1 Batch reactor case Mostly all reactions (among eight published articles) in the batch reactor are performed at 200 °C [65,67,69,70], and only single literature reported the lowest reaction temperature of 140 °C [62]. Interestingly, Wang et al. [62] reported using the lowest initial pressure of 4 MPa, but with a high reaction time of 15 h. Ye et al. reported the highest selectivity/yield of 99.7% (0.1 mmol) using an Ir-In2O3 single-atom catalyst at T = 200 °C, P = 6 MPa, H2:CO2 ratio = 5:1 with water as the solvent [70]. Similarly, with water as the solvent, Wang et al. [62] performed the solvent variation to estimate the optimized loading of water from 1 to 4 mL. They obtained a maximum of 91.4% ethanol selectivity with 3 mL of water using CoAlOx-600 catalyst but at a temperature lower than Ye et al. [70]. This signifies that Co as a promoter enhances the ethanol formation even at 140 °C and 4 MPa, which is attractive when low temperature and pressure are the key requirements and challenges. Also, if we talk about the case of the H2:CO2 ratio, then Wang et al. [62] used a 3:1 ratio as compared to Ye et al. [70] of 5:1. In the latter one, the higher use of hydrogen also increases the overall cost of the process, but on the other hand, they have performed the reaction only for 5 h. In contrast, the former one worked for 15 h, which is relatively high. This can be answered based on reaction conditions, i.e., CO2 activation generally requires high reaction temperature and pressure. However, if the optimized conditions are low, i.e., 140 °C and 4 MPa, then to activate CO2, one has to perform the reaction for a longer duration of time; otherwise, incomplete activation step led to poor ethanol selectivity, increasing the methanol in the product. Hence for future work, the CoAlOx-600 catalyst can be further modified by a dopant or designed so that the present high reaction time can be lowered, and side-by-side increasing the ethanol selectivity. Also, the single-atom catalyst proposed by Ye et al. [72] can be utilized in the future design of catalysts. Zhang et al. [80] recently explored that the metal carbide system still lacks good catalytic activity and showed lower selectivity towards ethanol. They showed excellent ethanol selectivity of 97.4% at a relatively moderate reaction temperature of 180 °C and pressure of 2 MPa using CoMoC x -800 catalyst. Hence a different combination of metal carbide systems can be designed and checked for their catalytic performance in ethanol synthesis. Now, if considering only the homogenous systems, then it was found that at the same reaction temperature of 200 °C, time of 12 h and DMI solvent, Cui et al. [65] showed the highest ethanol selectivity/yield of 87.5% (29.5 mmol L-1 h-1) using Ru3(CO)12-Co4(CO)12 catalyst, as compared to Qian et al. [67] of 47.3% (6.09 mmol L-1 h-1) ethanol selectivity/yield using Ru3(CO)12/Rh2(CO)4Cl2 catalyst. In the latter case, the lower selectivity was mainly due to the formation of C3-C4 alcohols, thereby reducing the selectivity of ethanol. While in the former case, the Co-active species helps in the forward reaction rate towards ethanol, while Ru species helps in the activation of CO2 via the carbonylation step. Therefore, further research can be performed using various bromide-promoted systems that can be used as a promotor in significantly enhancing ethanol formation via CO2. Also, other changes can be performed, such as using different co-catalysts, a different combinations of homogeneous catalysts, and different solvents."
18,Continuous flow reactor case,"6.2 Continuous flow reactor case In the continuous reactor case (among 12 published articles), all reaction temperature is greater or equal to 200 °C, and pressures above 2 MPa [22,24,39,71,73–78]. This can be assured that there is a need to address this issue at relatively low temperature, i.e., below 200 °C. The catalytic system developed by Ding et al. [71], i.e., Co@Na-Beta, provided ~100% ethanol selectivity at T = 300 °C and P = 2.1 MPa. They synthesized engineered catalyst based on the Co nanoparticles as the main active ingredient and Na-Beta as the support. It is highlighted that such catalytic systems, i.e., reactive ingredient plus the zeolitic support, play an excellent role in diminishing all the side reactions and only forming ethanol as the main product. The drawbacks of the process were (i) high reaction temperature which needs to be reduced in future research, and (ii) the low CO2 conversion of only 7.4%, which needs to be improved to make this system more viable to be used at an industrial level. This catalytic system can be used as a reference in designing more different combinations of metal nanoparticle centers and supporting future research. On the other hand, Lou et al. [24] synthesized Pd/CeO2 catalyst and showed improved CO2 conversion of 9.2%, which is better than Ding et al. [71]. Also, they got excellent ethanol selectivity/yield of 99.2% (45.6 gethanol gPd -1 h-1) at T = 240 °C and P = 3 MPa. As per the density functional theory, the two-atom Pd dimer structure helped in the scission of the C = O bond and easily performed the C − C coupling. The Pd dimers adsorbed CO well and did not allow it to desorb for the catalytic surface and then help in CO and CH3 coupling to form ethanol. Also, it was observed that Pd dimers are more helpful in promoting ethanol formation than Pd particles. Nevertheless, there was a small amount of methanol formation as confirmed by experimental studies, and therefore 100% selectivity towards ethanol needs to be focused on, which will reduce the cost of product separation. However, Lou et al. [24] utilize the noble metal strategy, hence for the future aspects, non-noble metal catalysts [22,39,71,73,74,76–78] are cheaper and have shown good results catalytic performance, need to be utilized in the CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol reaction. Apart from catalyst activity and selectivity, another critical parameter is catalyst stability, which cannot be ignored. Some studies have performed the catalytic stability analysis [61,65–67,69,70,80]. It was usually found that there was a decrease in catalyst activity either in subtle form or quite in higher amount. The reduced catalytic activity is due to its deactivation or loss in its amount during the repeated experimental analysis. From the recyclability studies, it can be identified that Ye et al. [70] show the highest drop (61.6%) in the ethanol yield, which is due to the formation of larger particles that lowered the catalytic activity by reducing the CO2 activation and also the C − C coupling. The Ir1-In2O3 catalyst employed can perform well by avoiding the reduction of In2O3 by lowering the amount of dopant involved, as in this case, it is Ir metal which H2-TPR confirmed. The agglomeration of Ir particles during recyclability studies increases the surface hydroxyl species, which is also a reason behind reducing In2O3. On the other hand, Wang et al. [66] synthesized Co0.52Ni0.48AlO x showed excellent durability after the 5th recyclability analysis of a 0% decrease in the ethanol yield. In this case, the reduction of Ni dopant helped maintain the ethanol yield, which was also confirmed using H2-TPR. Ni doping reduces the reduction temperature of Co metal, while for Ni, it is increased, which shows the formation of Co-Ni alloy. TEM images for used catalyst after the 5th cycle also confirm that particle size and composition remain the same for the fresh catalyst. For the catalyst to be scaled up, excellent stability is desired, allowing one to use the same catalyst for repeated experimental studies. Also, no catalyst recyclability studies were performed using a continuous flow reactor as per the authors' knowledge. Some catalyst stability analyses are performed, which is a crucial test for scaling operations. Based on industrial applications, the work performed by Zhang et al. [74] significantly provided valuable information regarding the stability of the catalyst till 300 h. However, apart from stability, ethanol selectivity remained an issue. As it remained ca. 60% of the overall alcohol mixture (~12%), which is significantly less. Also, among CH n species, methane was the major product formed. Hence, there is a crucial problem concerning the methanation pathway; hence, the formation of metallic Co should be avoided, promoting CH n formation. Even though this work focuses on stability, selectivity issues should be focused on in the future. Ding et al. [71] show promising results owing to 100% ethanol formed in the organic product and shows excellent stability up to 100 h. However, no recyclability studies were performed for continuous flow reactor cases, another essential aspect of scaling the process. Zhang et al. [79] recently showed the highest ethanol yield ever achieved using Na-Rh/S-1 catalyst of 72 mmol gRh -1 h-1 compared to other Rh-catalyzed ethanol synthesis work [55,76–78,81–83]. Also, their catalyst possesses excellent stability for 100 h, and no drop in ethanol yield was observed. Nevertheless, the ethanol selectivity was only 24% of the overall alcoholic mixture on the other side. Hence, for future aspects, catalyst recyclability analysis should be performed to determine the catalyst activity with respect to the number of recycling times. Also, it will give a clear picture regarding the deactivation study, which was not confirmed from the batch reactor system. Overall it can be deduced that much work needs to be performed, especially with non-noble metal catalysts. As per the future perspective point of view, future work can also be thought of capturing the CO2 and at the same time transforming it into ethanol. Hence, such materials can be synthesized, which should work as an adsorbent and catalyst at the same time. Still, much work needs to be done before scaling up this process to the industrial level."
19,Conclusions,"In this review, the trends regarding the CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol have been discussed. It has been known that CO2 is a GHG, leading to a problem like global warming, which is a serious issue nowadays. To cope with the increasing amount of CO2, one can use the CCU technique to synthesize catalysts that tend to capture the CO2 and then transform it into valuable fuel such as ethanol. Various reaction mechanisms have been proposed, and it was identified that CHO * intermediates are crucial for ethanol synthesis. Also, the catalyst should be designed so that it suppresses the methanation pathways, which is undesirable. For a greener route, one should design the catalyst that utilizes lower energy, gives higher selectivity towards ethanol, have good stability when utilized for various reused, and avoid the formation of compounds in the product that are harmful to the environment CH4 and CO. Ethanol has various applications in manufacturing drugs, plastics, lacquers, polishes, plasticizers, and cosmetics. Apart from this, the major application is as a fuel in regular vehicles. Ethanol does have a higher-octane rating, reduces the knocking phenomenon, and releases less harmful compounds when burnt (depends on the proportion of blend with gasoline). This review also focussed on variations of different conditions that are very important for the CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol, such as temperature, H2:CO2, time, solvent, metal loading, support, catalyst, and space velocity. Ethanol selectivity of ≥ 90% has been reported, but the conversion is on the lower side. Future studies should need to be performed to have higher conversion and ethanol selectivity/yield. From the industrial point of view, it is desired that the catalyst should give higher activity, selectivity, and stability for subsequent recyclability analyses. During catalyst stability analysis, reduction in the activity of the catalyst was mainly due to the loss of the catalyst. Hence, this problem should be tackled in future studies as a slight loss of the catalyst can significantly reduce the ethanol yield or selectivity."
