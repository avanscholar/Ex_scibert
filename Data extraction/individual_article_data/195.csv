0,Introduction,"Nowadays, with the steadily increasing fuel demand, growing concerns have been stimulated in the development of alternative energy resources due to their sustainability [1]. As a carbon-neutral and renewable feedstock, biomass has undoubtedly spurred interest in recent years, the utilization of which will pave a new route to produce green fuels [2–4]. As one of promising thermochemical techniques, fast pyrolysis has been developed for several decades for the conversion of biomass into bio-oil, which can be hailed as a sustainable liquid fuel [5,6]. Nonetheless, compositions in bio-oil are highly oxygenated because of the property of high oxygen content in biomass. Herein, bio-oil is unqualified for use in present energy infrastructure owing to the detrimentally poor thermal stability, extremely low heating value, prohibitively high viscosity, acidity and corrosiveness caused by high oxygen content [7]. Hence, numerous attempts have been made to expel oxygen from bio-oil and promote its quality, and one of the strategies is catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) technique that integrates fast pyrolysis and catalyst [8–10]. Among tremendous quantities of tested catalysts, it has been confirmed that ZSM-5 zeolite is the best in CFP for producing aromatic hydrocarbons attributing to its effective deoxygenating capacity and excellent shape selectivity [11–13]. Aromatic hydrocarbons are important chemicals and their enormous industrial application potential has been unearthed for octane enhancement or as raw materials for the production of high-valued solvents and plastics. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that biomass itself is naturally hydrogen-deficient, thereby inherently impeding the production of desirable aromatic hydrocarbons [14]. Many efforts have been made to address this challenge, and a feasible method for the promotion of aromatic hydrocarbon production and enhancement of bio-oil quality is catalytic fast co-pyrolysis (co-CFP) of biomass with another hydrogen-enriched feedstock [15,16]. In this view, fusel alcohol, which is a mixture of several alcohols derived from sugar and alcohol industries as a by-product and waste with an enormous production per year [17,18], has the potential to be appointed as the hydrogen supplier to be co-fed with biomass to benefit aromatic hydrocarbon production. Fusel alcohol contains a larger proportion of hydrogen and relatively less oxygen. It is anticipanted that fusel alcohol can act as hydrogen donor to biomass during co-CFP and balance the percentages of C, H, and O in the overall feedstock, hopefully causing a positive synergistic effect that can facilitate aromatic hydrocarbon formation and improve bio-oil quality [19]. Utilizing fusel alcohol as an additional material into co-CFP with biomass can be deemed as a viable alternative to yield multiple benefits for dealing with waste disposal as well as fuel recovery. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies involving co-CFP of biomass and fusel alcohol. In this study, biomass and fusel alcohol are co-pyrolyzed over ZSM-5 catalyst in a fluidized bed reactor to enhance aromatic hydrocarbon production. The effects of co-CFP temperature, catalyst loading and mass ratio of fusel alcohol to biomass on aromatic hydrocarbon production are investigated. Additionally, synergy between biomass and fusel alcohol during co-CFP has also been discussed. On the other hand, in order to unearth the origin of carbon and hydrogen in aromatic hydrocarbons derived from ZSM-5 catalyzed co-CFP, isotopic labeling technique is utilized to determine the fate of carbon and hydrogen that from different feedstocks via co-CFP of biomass with 13C or 2H labeled ethanol."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Corn stover, which is used as biomass samples, is collected from a fram field in the city of Yancherng in Jiangsu Province, China. Prior to experiments, all the corn stover is dried at 80 °C for 24 h, pulverized mechanically and sifted through a 40-mesh sieve. The proximate analysis of the air-dried corn stover is 7.27 wt.% moisture, 82.37 wt.% volatile, 4.06 wt.% ash, and 6.30 wt.% fixed carbon. The elemental composition of the dried corn stover is 41.77 wt.% carbon, 5.46 wt.% hydrogen, 42.34 wt.% oxygen, and 0.45 wt.% nitrogen. The component analysis of the dried corn stover is 36.89 wt.% cellulose, 29.33 wt.% hemi-cellulose, and 13.93 wt.% lignin. On the other hand, fusel alcohol is purchased from Yunnan Xingfan Chemical Co., LTD. The elemental composition of fusel alcohol is 64.78 wt.% carbon, 12.58 wt.% hydrogen, and 16.25 wt.% oxygen. Ammonium form ZSM-5 zeolite with a Si/Al ratio of 64, particle diameter of 2–5 μm and surface area of 390 m2/g is bought from Zeolyst International Company. Prior to use, ZSM-5 catalyst is calcined at 500 °C for 5 h in a muffle furnace in open air atmosphere for the activation to its protonated form. Additionally, 13C ethanol and 2H ethanol, which are used for isotopic labeling in this study, are provided by Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc."
3,Apparatus,"2.2 Apparatus A fluidized bed reactor system is established for co-CFP over ZSM-5 catalyst as shown in Fig. 1 . This system mainly consists of a continuous gas supplier, a semi-continuous biomass feeder, a semi-continuous liquid feeder, the fluidized bed reactor and a condenser. The height and inner diameter of the fluidized bed reactor are 840 mm and 50 mm, respectively. A perforated plate is set at the bottom of this reactor to support bed materials and guarantee a uniform distribution of the fluidizing gas. Quartz sand (particle size: 0.2–0.3 mm) mixed with ZSM-5 catalyst is used as bed materials and nitrogen is employed as fluidizing gas in the fluidized bed. A cylindrical furnace is used to supply the heat needed in the co-CFP coupled with a controller to control the desired temperature. A K-type thermocouple is applied to measure the co-CFP temperature. In order to remove fine particles, a cyclone separator is installed after the fluidized bed. Following the cyclone separator, pyrolytic vapors are introduced into a condenser for bio-oil collection. During experiments, bed materials are put in the fluidized bed reactor and certain amounts of corn stover and fusel alcohol are placed into the semi-continuous biomass feeder and liquid feeder, respectively. The total weight of corn stover and fusel alcohol is maintained at 50 g. After that, nitrogen (1.5 L/min) is purged for fluidization and cylindrical furnace is turned on for heating processing. When the fluidized bed reactor is heated to the desired temperature, corn stover and fusel alcohol are introduced into it semicontinually for co-CFP through the feeders. Co-pyrolysis reactions occurr in the reactor and the primary pyrolysis vapors are upgraded when they touch the ZSM-5 catalyst. Each experiment ran 45 min. Additionally, the total weight of corn stover and isotope-labelled ethanol is still maintained at 50 g during isotopic labeling testing. After each experiment, bio-oil is collected by the condenser. After bio-oil collection, the fluidizing gas is switched to air at 2.0 L/min for the combustion and removal of residual char in the reactor at 850 °C."
4,Products analysis,"2.3 Products analysis We identify the aromatic hydrocarbons in bio-oil with a 7890A/5975C gas chromatography/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) instrument (Agilent, USA). In this study, high-purity helium is employed as carrier gas (1.2 mL/min, 99.999%, Nanjing Maikesi Nanfen Special Gas Co., Ltd.). Besides, the oven temperature is 40 °C, which is held for 3 min initially and then increases to 290 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. It is held at 290 °C for 5 min. The GC/MS injector temperature of 250 °C and detector temperature of 230 °C are held. The GC separation is carried out using a capillary column named HP-5 MS, and a split ratio of 1:10 is used with the injection size of 1 μL. Moreover, it is worth noting that an internal standard is used to calibrate this method for quantitative analysis. In addition, for isotopic labeling investigation, determinations of distribution of 13C and 12C carbon or 1H and 2H hydrogen in each aromatic hydrocarbon product are done on the basis of mass spectral data using the methodology decribled by Dorado et al. [20]."

6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of co-CFP temperature on aromatic hydrocarbon production,"3.1 Effect of co-CFP temperature on aromatic hydrocarbon production As known, reaction temperature plays a crucial role on biomass CFP process, and this section aims to explore aromatic hydrocarbon yields under varied co-CFP temperatures over ZSM-5 catalyst. During experiments, the mass ratio of fusel alcohol to biomass is set at 1:1, and the catalyst to feedstock ratio is 1:5. Fig. 2 presents the carbon and hydrogen yields of aromatic hydrocarbons from co-CFP of corn stover and fusel alcohol in the fluidized bed reactor. As depicted, the carbon and hydrogen yields of aromatic hydrocarbons vary significantly with temperature. The carbon and hydrogen yields of toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, indene and total aromatic hydrocarbons tend to initially rise with increasing co-CFP temperature and reach the maximum amounts at 550 °C. However, their yields decline as the reaction temperature further increase. The maximum carbon and hydrogen yields of total aromatic hydrocarbons are 94.0 and 52.7%, respectively. On the contrary, the carbon and hydrogen yields of benzene and naphthalene increase steadily with the increasing temperature. Further, it can be also observed that the change of carbon and hydrogen yields of aromatic hydrocarbons as a function of co-CFP temperature present the similar trend. Particularly, aromatic hydrocarbons can be formed via two main mechanism pathways (see Fig. 3 ) (1) For furans, which are mainly produced from the depolymerization of hemicellulose fragments and bio-derived anhydro-oligosaccharides [21–23], they can be involved in Diels-Alder condensation as diene to react with monoene dienophiles from fusel alcohol decomposition, forming monocyclic oxygenated intermediates, which can be further transformed into aromatic hydrocarbons through subsequent dehydration reactions [24]. Clearly, greater co-CFP temperature provides the ability to advance thermal decomposition of biomass to produce furans [25], accordingly facilitating the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons. However, thermal over-cracking of furans into smaller molecular-weight incoagulable gases will evolve into predominant reactions when the co-CFP temperature is higher than 550 °C [26], thusly handicapping the production in aromatic hydrocarbons. (2) Deoxygenation of bio-derived oxygenated chemicals via hydrocarbon pool within ZSM-5 is another vital reaction approach for aromatic hydrocarbon production. In the event that the crude pyrolytic vapors from co-pyrolysis of corn stover and fusel alcohol diffuse into the ZSM-5 catalyst, oxygenated chemicals (e.g., acids, alcohols, esters, aldehydes, ketones, furans, sugars, and phenols) in coagulable volatile organic vapors will be eliminated through serial reactions involving the breaking of CO bonds coupled with dehydration, decarbonylation, decarboxylation, cyclization, alkylation and aromatization within the inner ZSM-5 structure via a common intermediate named hydrocarbon pool [27,28], therefore depleting oxygen as H2O, CO and CO2 and converting carbon and hydrogen into aromatic hydrocarbons. Our previous research claims that reaction temperature of 500–600 °C can favor the production of aromatic hydrocarbons via hydrocarbon pool mechanism [29]. Therefore, as a result of aforementioned two factors, co-CFP temperature of 550 °C gives rise to the maximum aromatic hydrocarbon yield."
8,Effect of catalyst loading on aromatic hydrocarbon production,"3.2 Effect of catalyst loading on aromatic hydrocarbon production The effect of catalyst loading on aromatic hydrocarbon production from co-CFP of corn stover and fusel alcohol is implemented in this section. During experiments, the co-CFP temperature is fixed at 550 °C, the mass ratio of fusel alcohol to biomass is set at 1:1, and the catalyst to feedstock ratios (m/m) are no catalyst, 1:20, 1:15, 1:10, 1:5, respectively. Fig. 4 shows the effect of catalyst loading on carbon and hydrogen yields of aromatic hydrocarbons. As shown, there are almost no aromatic hydrocarbons in the pyrolytic oil fraction without catalyst. Obviously, the utilization of ZSM-5 can favor the cracking of fusel alcohol into monoenes, thus enhancing Diels-Alder reactions coupled with aromatic hydrocarbon production. Besides, ZSM-5 has demonstrated a good ability for the deoxygenation transformation of oxygenated chemicals into aromatic hydrocarbons via hydrocarbon pool. As the result, the use of catalyst gives rise to a remarkable increase in aromatic hydrocarbon yield compared with no catalyst. Furthermore, one can see that the carbon and hydrogen yields of individual and total aromatic hydrocarbons increase dramatically over the ranges of catalyst loading studied. This can be explained by the fact that more catalyst loading amount can provide more active sites for the cracking and deoxygenation, and meanwhile increase the relative residence time of primary pyrolytic vapors passing through it."
9,Effect of mass ratio of fusel alcohol to biomass on aromatic hydrocarbon production,"3.3 Effect of mass ratio of fusel alcohol to biomass on aromatic hydrocarbon production In this section, the influence of mass ratio of fusel alcohol to biomass on aromatic hydrocarbon production is investigated at the co-CFP temperature of 550 °C and the catalyst to feedstock ratio of 1:5. Fig. 5 shows the carbon and hydrogen yields of aromatic hydrocarbons from co-CFP under different mass ratios of fusel alcohol to biomass. As depicted, one can see that both the carbon and hydrogen yields of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, indene and total aromatic hydrocarbons in bio-oil initially increase with elevated proportion of fusel alcohol in the blends, reach their maximum amounts when the mass ratio of fusel alcohol to biomass is 1:1, and then decay as the mass ratio of fusel alcohol to biomass further augments. These observations demonstrate that the addition of fusel alcohol can facilitate the transformation of oxygenated chemicals and favor the aromatic hydrocarbon production. In the contrary, it can be discerned that the carbon and hydrogen yields of naphthalene downswing gradually as the proportion of fusel alcohol increases in the feedstock mixture. As known, naphthalene is a critical precursor for coking on the surface of ZSM-5 [30], which can lead to the rapid inactivation of catalyst, and this result elucidates that the introduction of fusel alcohol can prevent coking process, reduce coke amount on ZSM-5 and improve catalyst life during co- CFP. This is in good agreement with the results of a previous study by Zhou et al. [31]. A key index that has been proven to be of significant importance to affect aromatic hydrocarbon production in bio-oil is hydrogen to carbon effective (H/Ceff) ratio [29,32]. Abbreviation in the bracket is used in the following description. H/Ceff is defined as H/Ceff = (moles of H – 2 × mol of O – 3 × mol of N – 2 × mol of S)/moles of C. The H/Ceff ratios of individual corn stover and fusel alcohol in this study are 0.02 and 1.95, respectively. Distinctly, the H/Ceff of overall feedstock (corn stover + fusel alcohol) studied here is substantially increased with an elevated fusel alcohol amount in the blends. When the mass ratio of fusel alcohol to biomass is 1:1, the H/Ceff of feedstock mixture is approximately 1.20. The carbon and hydrogen yields of aromatic hydrocarbons in bio-oil under varied H/Ceff ratios are preseed in Fig. 6 . These observable convex parabolic curves in Fig. 6 signify a synergistic effect between corn stover and fusel alcohol, and this synergy increases the yields of aromatic hydrocarbons in bio-oil as co-CFP progresses, demonstrating that co-CFP process can convert more undefined oxygenated chemicals into aromatic hydrocarbons in bio-oil. This phenomenon can be due to two main reasons. On one hand, fusel alcohol possesses the advantages of hydrogen donation into co-CFP process and production of hydrogen-rich intermediates. As the result, more hydrogen in fusel alcohol can be transformed into aromatic hydrocarbons within ZSM-5. On the other hand, as revealed, part of oxygenated intermediates from corn stover pyrolysis can benefit the chain scission and dehydration of fusel alcohol [33], consequently producing olefins and favoring aromatic hydrocarbon formation. With the consideration of aromatic hydrocarbon yields in the pyrolytic bio-oil, the mass ratio of fusel alcohol to biomass of 1:1 in the blends (H/Ceff = 1.20) is the best option."
10,Origin of carbon and hydrogen in aromatic hydrocarbons derived in ZSM-5 catalyzed co-CFP using isotopic labeling,"3.4 Origin of carbon and hydrogen in aromatic hydrocarbons derived in ZSM-5 catalyzed co-CFP using isotopic labeling Co-CFP of corn stover with fusel alcohol over ZSM-5 has been a successful attempt to produce high-concentration aromatic hydrocarbons, with a yield promotion in comparison with the sum total of their individual CFP products. In order to unearth the origin of carbon and hydrogen in aromatic hydrocarbons derived from ZSM-5 catalyzed co-CFP, isotopic labeling technique is utilized for ulteriorly discerning the fate of carbon and hydrogen that from different feedstocks. In this study, 13C or 2H ethanol (H/Ceff = 2) is selected as both hydrogen-rich feedstock and isotopic carrier to be co-fed with corn stover, with a co-CFP temperature of 550 °C, a catalyst to feedstock ratio of 1:5, and a mass ratio of ethanol to biomass of 1:1. After blends of 12C biomass and 13C ethanol or 1H biomass and 2H ethanol are subjected to CFP, aromatic hydrocarbons that contain molecules of mixed origins will be produced. Fig. 7 outlines the distribution of carbon of hydrogen from corn stover and ethanol in aromatic hydrocarbons from the co-CFP of both feedstocks with ZSM-5. Overall, for the blends of corn stover and ethanol studied here, the proportions of biogenic carbon and hydrogen in the total resultant aromatic hydrocarbons are 51.2% and 41.1%, respectively. Specifically, 39.7% of the carbon and 40.3% of the hydrogen in the benzene formed are biogenic, suggesting that more than 50% of the carbon and hydrogen in the benzene are from ethanol. These results imply that carbon and hydrogen atoms from both feedstocks can coexist in the individual aromatic hydrocarbon and make up the targeted products during co-CFP of the blends. As above-mentioned, aromatic hydrocarbons are formed through both Diels-Alder cycloaddition and catalyst-induced hydrocarbon pool (see Fig. 3). In this investigation, benzene, toluene and xylene account for the largest fraction in aromatic hydrocarbons. Theoretically, Diels-Alder cycloaddition reactions between furans (derived from biomass) and ethylene (derived from ethanol) in this study (Eqs. (3)–(5)) will lead to a production of 12C4 13C2 1H4 2H2 benzene, 12C5 13C2 1H6 2H2 toluene, and 12C6 13C2 1H8 2H2 xylene, which is totally not consistent with experimental results (12C2.4 13C3.6 1H2.4 2H3.6 benzene, 12C3.1 13C3.9 1H3.4 2H4.6 toluene, and 12C4.8 13C3.2 1H3.9 2H6.1 xylene). This finding signifies that catalyst-induced hydrocarbon pool mechanism is the dominant approach for aromatic hydrocarbon production during co-CFP process. On the basis of results studied here, it can be inferred that hydrocarbon pool provides the ability to promote the transformation of more carbon and hydrogen atoms from ethanol into resultant aromatic hydrocarbons. Simultaneously, it is worth noting that the carbon yield of total aromatic hydrocarbons (94.2%) is much higher than the corresponding hydrogen yield (52.8%). This observation verifies that the main challenge for aromatic hydrocarbon production through co-CFP over ZSM-5 is to reduce the needed hydrogen amount in feedstocks and meanwhile increase the hydrogen yield. A feasible way is to facilitate the removal of oxygen in the formation of CO or CO2 rather than H2O during co-CFP, and we will implement in-depth investigation in the future."
11,Conclusions,"In this paper, co-CFP of biomass and fusel alcohol over ZSM-5 catalyst is implemented in a fluidized bed reactor and aromatic hydrocarbons are selected as target products. Bio-derived aromatic hydrocarbons can be formed through Diels-Alder cycloaddition and catalyst-induced hydrocarbon pool. It is noticed that co-CFP temperature of 550 °C results in the maximum aromatic hydrocarbon yields and the carbon and hydrogen yields of individual and total aromatic hydrocarbons upswing remarkably with an elevated catalyst loading amount. Additionally, an apparent synergy between biomass and fusel alcohol is observed during co-CFP, with a yield enhancement over the sum of their individual CFP products. From the perspective of aromatic hydrocarbon yields in the pyrolytic bio-oil, the mass ratio of fusel alcohol to biomass of 1:1 in the blends (H/Ceff = 1.20) is the best option. On the other hand, isotopic labeling technique is utilized to unearth the origin of carbon and hydrogen in aromatic hydrocarbons, and the results demonstrate that carbon and hydrogen atoms from both feedstocks can coexist in the individual aromatic hydrocarbon and make up the targeted products during co-CFP of the blends."
