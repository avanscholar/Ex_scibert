0,Introduction,"Extensive use of fossil fuel contributes to the increase the atmospheric CO2 level that results in global warming [1]. At the same time, it also caused serious environmental pollution, especially air contamination. Therefore, seeking renewable alternatives to fossil fuels has received much attention from governments and research communities worldwide. Among the potential routes for the sustainable production of renewable fuel, the conversion of lipid to bio-fuel is a promising route for the production of the bio-fuel with the similar carbon number of diesel oil. Two kinds of samples in China were named Plant oil asphalt (POA) for as a heavy black viscous liquid and highly complex nature, which make POA difficult to treat. First class, which contains saturated 60–70% fatty acid, 5–10% plant sterol, 5% vitamin E and inorganic matter etc. [2], is a by-product during oleic acid production. Second class, which contains fatty acid methyl ester, is the by-product of biodiesel industry. During 2010, over 6 × 105 tons of POA that is a by-product during oleic acid production was produced in China [3]. It was generally disposed as a waste, which, however, was prohibited in recent years, due to the strict regulations of environmental protection. From august 2016, POA is defined as a hazardous material and can only be disposed by professional company [4]. How to effective dispose POA making an important issue to oleic acid production. For containing fatty acid, it can be potentially used as a feedstock for the production of bio-fuel with low viscosity using pyrolysis method. Tang et al. [3,5–7] have reported the conversion of the second class of POA to bio-fuel and found high fraction of dimer acid presented in POA, while no such dimer acids in first class [8]. Owing to the POA is defined as a hazardous material, it is necessary to develop new method to disposal POA, like pyrolysis to obtain bio-fuel. At the same time it can be realized harmless and resource utilization of POA. Many methods have been reported to transform biomass to bio-fuel, like pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction, transesterification and etc. [9–11]. Pyrolysis has been widely recognized as a promising technology to produce bio-fuel [12]. It can be used for conversion of all kinds of organic-waste due to the simple process and low requirement for equipment. Triglycerides have been reported to be efficiently converted to bio-fuel using this technology [13,14]. In addition, fatty acids [15,16] and fatty acids salts [17,18] were also reported to be efficiently converted to bio-fuel using this method. In our previous work, pyrolysis was used to crack saturated ester and waste oil [15,19–21]. Similarly, POA can also be cracked via pyrolysis to obtain bio-fuel. This kind of POA has been investigated by vacumm pyrolysis method [3]. They found that the peak area of alkane, alkene and fatty acid was 24.57%, 21.29% and 39.42%, respectively. The possibility mechanism was proposed. However, the pyrolysis property of heavy compounds, like plant sterol were not mentioned. The heavy compounds in bio-fuel were also not analyzed. The aim of this work was to investigate the characteristics of pyrolysis of POA (first class) and the feasibility of POA as a feedstock for bio-fuel production. The objectives of this paper were: (1) to investigate the pyrolysis characteristics of POA; (2) to investigate the component of bio-fuel; (3) to investigate of combustion characteristics of bio-fuel. The results provided the essential information for evaluating the possibility of pyrolysis products of POA as a qualified bio-fuel with potential applications."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials POA was supplied by Changzhou ZhengDa grain and oil industrial group Co., Ltd, Changzhou, China."
3,Pyrolysis experiment,"2.2 Pyrolysis experiment Pyrolysis experiment was carried out in a vertical stainless steel batch reactor (600 mm in length with an inner diameter of 38 mm). The Schematic diagram of POA pyrolysis process was described in our previous paper [20,21]. High-purity nitrogen was used as a carrier gas with flow rate of 80 mL/min. After the temperature increased to the setting value, the pyrolysis experiment was carried out. The POA was injected using flow pump with 0.05 L/h. The POA was then decomposed and vaporized. The vapor left the reactor and cooled by ice bath. During this process, heavy and light products were all collected. The liquid products were collected using a mixture of methanol and mineral ether mixture (1:1, v/v) immersed in an ice bath. The gas was not collected. The residue was collected using metal gauze, which can retain the solid residue in the reactor while vapor pass the metal gauze. After pyrolysis, the solvent was removed using rotary evaporator to obtain the crude bio-fuel. Every experiment was repeated for three times to minimize the experimental errors."
4,Analysis,"2.3 Analysis Dynamic viscosity was measured using SYP-IA viscometers (GB/T265-88) at 25 °C. The calorific value was measured using IKA-C200 calorimetric bomb (ASTM D4809) at 25 °C. Acid value of bio-fuel was measured by titration method. In a typical procedure, a known amount of bio-fuel was first dissolved in isopropanol, and then titrated with an isopropanol solution of potassium hydroxide that was known concentration. During process, phenolphthalein was employed as a color indicator. When the color of solution in the flask showed pink and stayed for 30 s, it indicated that end point of the titration was achieved. The Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) study was conducted by using a Bruker (55FTIR) FTIR Spectrometer. The Thermogravimetry-Fourier Transform Infrared analysis (TG-FTIR) experiment was performed by using a simultaneous TG (NETZSCH STA 409) coupled with FTIR (Nicolet IS10). The temperature was increased from 40 to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. About 20 mg of POA sample was loaded in Al2O3 crucible without cap. The decomposition products were brought to FTIR by high-purity N2, which was used as a purge gas with a flow rate of 50 mL/min to provide an inert environment. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) spectra were recorded with a 400 MHz Bruker DPX-400 using chloroform-d as a solvent. Chloroform-d and tetramethylsilane (TMS) were used as a solvent and internal standard, respectively. The samples were scanned at a rate of 128 files/min. 13C NMR spectra were recorded from chloroform-d solutions at 400 MHz by using a Bruker-400 spectrometer. The samples were scanned at a rate of 2048 files/min. The experiments were carried out at 25 °C. An Agilent 7890A-5975C Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) coupled with a DB-5MS column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm) was used to analyze the composition of bio-fuel. Bio-fuel was dissolved by using CH2Cl2. The detailed information can be found in previous work [22]. Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (Py-GC-MS) analysis was performed on a CDS 5000 series pyrolyser coupled with Agilent Technologies 7890A GC system and Agilent Technologies 5975C MS system. About 5 mg sample was cracked at 600 °C. The detailed information can be found in our previous work [19]. The detail information of bio-fuel ESI FT-ICR MS analysis was described in our previous works [10,19,21]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,The thermal decomposition characteristics of POA,"3.1 The thermal decomposition characteristics of POA 3.1.1 FTIR analysis The FTIR results of POA were listed in Fig. 1 A. The peak at 3008 cm−1 was the stretching vibration of the unsaturated = C–H bond, which was ascribed to plant sterol. The peaks located at 2926 and 2854 cm−1 were the antisymmetric and symmetric vibration of CH2 bond, respectively. The peak at 1705 cm−1 was the characteristic peak of fatty acid [15]. The peaks located at 1460 and 720 cm−1 were the bending vibration of CH2 and (CH2)n, respectively. It indicated that long chain aliphatic compounds presented in the POA. The peak located at 1375 cm−1 was attributed to bending vibration of C–H. The peak located 1280 cm−1 was the bending vibration of O–H, which indicated the presence of plant sterol in POA. The peak of 960 cm−1 was the bending vibration of trans CC bond, which was ascribed to the plant sterol [23]. The above results clearly confirmed that long chain fatty acid and plant sterol were presented in POA. 3.1.2 TG–FTIR analysis of POA The typical TG-DTG results of POA were shown in Fig. 2 . It was found that the main decomposition peaks were located at 320 and 416 °C, respectively. Above 210 °C, the mass intensity of POA began to loss slowly. At 250 °C, the mass loss of POA was about only 5.5%. However, after 250 °C, the decomposition reaction was accelerated. Hence, the initial decomposition temperature of POA was not at 210 °C, which was possibly related to the volatilization of the light compounds. The initial decomposition temperature in the present work was ascertained using 5% mass loss according to the method reported by Li et al. [24]. The initial decomposition temperature of POA was 255.7 °C at 10 °C/min. In our previous work, it was found that the pyrolysis temperature for behenic acid was 362 °C at a ramping rate of 20 °C/min [15]. However, the decomposition temperature of myristic acid and palmic acid were 315 and 320 °C, respectively [25]. Hence, the first decomposition peak was mainly ascribed to the pyrolysis of fatty acid, especially the saturated fatty acid. The second peak may be ascribed to plant sterols, since plant sterols are heavy compounds, which caused that the decomposition temperature shifted to high temperature. The residue of POA after the pyrolysis was only about 3%, which implied that the amount of plant sterol was about 37% according to TG-DTG results. The TG-DTG results also suggested that POA can be decomposed relatively easy, while the decomposition of plant sterol required a high temperature. The TG-FTIR results of POA (Fig. 3 ) showed that after heating for 31.3 min (at 350 °C), a very small peak located at 2900 cm−1 changed, which indicated the formation of the CH2 bond in the pyrolysis products, although it was very weak. The typical carboxylic acid (1700 cm−1) was also found [15], which further confirmed the presence of fatty acid in POA. This result also indicated that the pyrolysis of POA took place. At this point, the temperature was about 350 °C. After 38.4 min (at about 420 °C), the FTIR characteristic signals of the function groups were stronger than that at 350 °C, which indicated that pyrolysis reaction was accelerated. The recorded strong absorption at 2930 and 2860 cm−1 were attributed to the presence of methylene groups (CH2). In addition, another characteristic peak was 1770 cm−1, which was corresponding to CO, indicating the presence of ketones, esters or carboxylic acids [26]. Moreover, the peak located at 1110 cm−1 was attributed to the presence of alkyl ketone [27,28]. A very small peak was recorded at 3570 cm−1, which might be attributed to alcohol or fatty acid [26]. After 44.6 min (at about 480 °C), the FTIR characteristic signals of the function groups became much stronger. The peak located at 3015 cm−1 may be ascribed to aromatic material. It indicated that the POA contains unsaturated fatty acid, resulting in aromatic compounds formation. The recorded vibration at 730, 1260 and 1370 cm−1 might be ascribed to the C–H vibration of long chain hydrocarbon or aromatics, C–H vibration of alkyne or alkane, respectively. After 58.1 min (at about 620 °C), the weak peaks were recorded, which implied that the pyrolysis reaction was close to finish (Fig. 3). From the FTIR results, the change of functional group was found at different temperature. With the temperature increasing, the fatty acid (1700 cm−1) was transformed to ester (1770 cm−1) step-wisely. When temperature was heated to 450 °C (41.2 min), almost no characteristic peaks of fatty acid were found, which indicated that the fatty acid was transformed to ester or underwent decarboxylation or decarboxylation reaction. After 44.6 min (480 °C), the aromatic peak (3015 cm−1) was notable, which indicated that the long chain of fatty acid was transformed or condensed to aromatic rings. Another possibility was that plant sterols decomposed to form intermediate that contained hexatomic ring, then intermediate underwent dehydrogenation reaction to form aromatic derivative. From this pyrolysis characteristic, it was confirmed that POA contained unsaturated fatty acid for saturated fatty acid was difficult to form aromatic structures [15]. At the same time, the signal of the characteristic peak of OH (3570 cm−1) was very strong, indicating that the plant sterol began to crack. Hence, the preliminary decomposition characteristic of POA can be obtained from the TG-FTIR, which was in accordance with the results of TG-DTG. 3.1.3 Py-GC–MS analysis of POA Py-GC-MS was further carried out to analyze POA pyrolysis products in a manner of in situ mode (Fig. 4 A and Table 1 ). It was found that the main components were fatty acids and alkenes, with the percentage of ca.54.7% and 27.9%, respectively. Alkanes had a share of ca.8.8%. However, plant sterol pyrolysis derivatives had the percentage of ca.2.7%. The fraction of fatty acid in pyrolysis products was very high, which was probably due to the very short residence time during the fast pyrolysis process. Pyrolysis of fatty acid and plant sterol was probably the main reaction taking place during the pyrolysis of POA. Hence, the pyrolysis product distributions and pyrolysis characteristics of POA were different from those of plant oil, fatty acid or waste oil. In the bio-fuel, linoleic acid was detected. In industrial production process, almost no unsaturated fatty acid can be found in POA. According to the TG-FTIR and Py-GC-MS results, it was confirmed that dehydrogenation reaction occurred during the pyrolysis of POA. Short chain fatty acid and other short chain compounds were found in the decomposition products, indicated that the long chain of fatty acid was broken. About 45% linoleic acid presented in bio-fuel. It can be confirmed that linoleic acid was formed from the saturated fatty acid. If linoleic acid was presented in POA, it would form aromatic compounds [29]. In the resulting products, the fraction of aromatic compounds was very low, about 0.75%. Hence, it indicated that the linoleic acid was produced from the saturated fatty acid, and the dehydrogenation reaction took place during POA pyrolysis process. Tang et al. also thought that unsaturated fatty acid originated from POA [3]. In order to further investigate the properties of the resulting bio-fuel, the POA was cracked and the composition of the bio-fuel was characterized with FTIR, GC-MS, ESI FT-ICR MS and etc."
7,The components analysis of bio-fuel,"3.2 The components analysis of bio-fuel 3.2.1 FTIR analysis The bio-fuel obtained from cracking of POA at 600 °C was analyzed by FTIR (Fig. 1B). Two remarkable peaks were recorded at 2950 and 2850 cm−1, which were the antisymmetric and symmetric vibration of saturated CH2 bond, respectively. The peak at 1710 cm−1 corresponds to CO, which was attributed to the presence of the aldehydes, ketones, ester or carboxylic acid [30]. According to the Py-GC-MS results, the most probability of the peak at 1710 cm−1 attributed to fatty acid. The C–O stretching vibration of fatty acid also appeared at 1410 cm−1. The vibration located at 810, 903 and 940 cm−1 might be attributed to the C–H vibration of aromatic material. The peak located at 810 cm−1 might be attributed to substituted aromatic material, which may be related to the decomposition of plant sterol. The peaks located at 1465 cm−1 and 720 cm−1 were the bending vibration of CH2 and (CH2)n, respectively. The result indicated that bio-fuel contained long chain aliphatic compounds. The peak located at 1375 cm−1 was attributed to the bending vibration of C–H [31]. The peak located at 1410 cm−1 was attributed to the C–H vibration of alkene [32]. The strong peak located at 1285 cm−1 was the bending vibration of O–H, which indicated that alcohol was found in bio-fuel. The peak located at 2680 cm−1 was ascribed to C–H of stretching vibration of aldehyde [28]. The weak vibration of peak located at 3050 cm−1 was ascribed to C–H of aromatic compounds. According to the above analysis, it was confirmed that the main components in bio-fuel were fatty acids and aliphatic hydrocarbons. The fraction of alcohol, aromatic compounds and other oxygen containing compounds was relatively low. 3.2.2 GC-MS analysis The GC-MS analysis of the bio-fuel was also carried out to understand the detailed composition of the bio-fuel (Fig. 4B and Table 2 ). The bio-fuel mainly contained alkanes, alkenes and oxygenated compounds. The fraction of the oxygenated compounds was very high. Fatty acid, ester and alcohol were all observed. To the best of our knowledge, few study reported the alcohol was found in the bio-fuel from the pyrolysis of the plant oil [21,33,34]. Pyrolysis products of vegetable oil (like soybean oil) mainly contained alkane, alkene and fatty acid. However, the present results showed that the fraction of alkene, alkane and fatty acid was 21.4%, 6.4% and 18.7%, respectively. In addition, the fraction of the derivatives of plant sterols was very high (35.21%) in the bio-fuel, which agreed with the TG-DTG results. The fraction of plant sterol derivative in Py-GC-MS result was not high. The Py-GC-MS experiment was an in situ process of pyrolysis, but GC-MS experiment was an ex situ process. In the GC-MS result, it was found that the fraction of fatty acid was not high but in Py-GC-MS result it was very high, which was probably caused by the difference in experiment conditions. The compositions of the pyrolysis products were also influenced by the composition of the feedstock. The products from pyrolysis of fatty acid also contained alkane, alkene and aromatic compounds [16]. The fraction of aromatic compounds was very low in saturated fatty acid [15], while the fraction of heavy compounds was high. The carbon number of heavy compounds exceeded 18, especially for the oxygen containing compounds [15]. The plant sterol derivatives were found in bio-fuel from GC-MS results. For plant sterol is a heavy compound, the carbon number is very high, which might have some difficulties for converting into very small molecules. Plant sterol contains hexatomic ring, while a small fraction of aromatic compounds was found. It was confirmed that the degree of plant sterol converting to small molecular compounds was very low. Hence, it was confirmed that the aromatic compounds mainly originated from saturated fatty acid, which was converted to unsaturated fatty acid then further converted to aromatic compounds. It also can demonstrate that the fatty acids in POA were saturated fatty acid from our previous work and Asomaning et al. results [15,16]. The Py-GC-MS and GC-MS results indicated the occurrence of the dehydrogenation reaction of plant sterol during the pyrolysis. The above results also confirmed that pyrolysis products of POA were very different from that from plant oil pyrolysis [19,33]. 3.2.3 NMR analysis In order to further confirm the functional groups of the bio-fuel, 1H NMR and 13C NMR were carried out. Fig. 5 A showed the 1H NMR spectrum of bio-fuel. From 0.5 to 2 ppm, the region of the spectrum proton was aliphatic [27,35]. From 0.7 to 1.1 ppm, a sharp peak was recorded, which was ascribed to the CH3 group [27,36]. From 1.1 to 1.4 ppm, the biggest peak ascribing to β-CH2 was recorded [37]. From 1.5 to 1.8 ppm, the relative weak peak was attributed to β-carboxyl group [19]. From 1.8 to 2.2 ppm, the relative weak peak belonged to methylene of double bond [27,36], confirming the presence of alkene in bio-oil. The peak located in the range of 2.2–2.5 ppm was α-methylene group of carboxyl [27,36], representing the presence of fatty acid in the bio-fuel. The very weak peak in the range of 2.5–2.8 ppm was hydrogen on α-position of aromatic rings [25,38], indicating that low fraction of aromatic compounds presented in bio-duel. A very weak peak was recorded at 3.7 ppm, indicating –CH3 on α-position of alcohol [27], which was agreed with Py-GC-MS, FTIR and GC-MS results. It was related to pyrolysis products of plant sterol. The very weak peak recorded at 4.9–5.1 ppm represented CH of glycerides [27,36], confirming the presence of ester in bio-fuel. It implied that ester cannot be decomposed completely during pyrolysis. The peak in the range of 5.2–5.5 ppm region indicated the spectrum of olefin [27,36], which implied the presence of unsaturated compounds in the bio-fuel. The very weak peaks located in the range of 5.5–6 ppm represented the different olefin protons. The very weak peaks recorded from 6.5 to 7.5 ppm indicated the presence of mono-aromatic and di-aromatic compounds. Finally, the very weak signal located in the range of 9.8–11 ppm might be ascribed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, which demonstrated the presence of plant sterol derivatives in bio-fuel. 13C NMR analysis showed that the main peak regions located at 0–50 ppm and 75–80 ppm (Fig. 5B). In the range of 0–40 ppm, the peaks represented the saturated aliphatic group [39]. The peak located at 13.5 ppm belonged to terminal methyl carbon. In the range of 22–29 ppm the sharp peaks belonged to the branched methyl carbon. The very weak peaks located in the range of 40–60 ppm attributed to methyl carbon [27]. The very sharp peak located at 77 ppm belonged to the CH3–O-CHx group [40]. However, no trace information about the presence of ether was found in FTIR, GC-MS and 1H NMR results. Hence, it might belong to alcohol [27]. The alcohol was found in the GC-MS analysis. In the range of 110–120 ppm, the very weak peaks were ascribed to the terminal olefin carbons, while the weak peaks located in the range of 120–140 ppm belonged to the olefin carbon and aromatic carbon [27,37]. The very weak peak located at 180 ppm was ascribed to the saturated fatty acid. As a general statement, the results of FTIR and GC-MS of bio-fuel were consistent with that of NMR. 3.2.4 ESI FT-ICR MS analysis According to the above experimental results, many heavy compounds were recorded in bio-fuel. However, they cannot be detected in GC-MS for their low volatility. ESI FT-ICR MS experiment was an effective method to analyze heavy compounds [15,19,21]. The ESI FT-ICR MS results of the bio-fuel produced were listed in Fig. 6 . The relative abundances of heteroatom were listed in Fig. 7 . It was found that the oxygen containing compounds in the bio-fuel were mainly carboxylic groups, which confirmed the high fraction of fatty acids in the bio-fuel. In O1 class, carbon number of many compounds exceeded 18, with a relatively high double bond equivalence (DBE) value. In the products from the cracking of fatty acid, it was difficult to form much higher DBE value (DBE = 12). Hence, it was confirmed that it was related to the pyrolysis products from plant sterol. The C21, C22, C24 alcohol, in which DBE was 1, was possibly formed from cracking of the fatty acid. Hence, according to the above results, it can be confirmed that both dehydrogenation and hydrogenation processes took place during the pyrolysis. Concerning the O2 class, the main components was C18 (oleic acid or stearic acid). As POA is a by-product of oleic acid industry, it is thus confirmed that the oleic acid in the bio-fuel was produced from the pyrolysis of other fatty acids. Many saturated fatty acids were recorded in POA, with carbon number exceeded 18. It implied that long chain fatty acids were converted to short ones and the saturated fatty acids were converted to unsaturated ones during the pyrolysis. In O3 class, it showed that the main components have 18 carbon atoms, which might be attributed to the hydroxyl carboxylic acids, forming from unsaturated acids at the high temperature. In O4 class, the carbon number of many compounds exceeded 18, with mainly dimer acid formed via polymerization of oleic acid. The polymerization reaction was possibly the main path to form the dicarboxylic acid. In the dimer acid mixture, a very high DBE value was found. It was possibly related to the dehydrogenation reaction. Therefore, ESI FT-IR MS results confirmed that hydrogenation, dehydrogenation and polymerization reactions were involved during the pyrolysis. The chemical composition of the bio-fuel was further performed using the van Krevelen diagrams [41,]. In Fig. 8 , O/C versus H/C plot was listed. The van Krevelen diagram provided a deep insight into the nature of the bio-fuel. Each region of the van Krevelen diagram referred to a specific class of compounds. From the results reported by Yan et al., Fig. 8 was a typical distribution of the products from the pyrolysis of lipids [42]. Primary species were located in a relatively narrow region with O/C < 0.15 and 1.2 < H/C < 2. The lower the respective ratio (O/C), the greater the energy content and properties of the bio-fuel according to Fig. 8 and Kim et al. results [43]. Compared with fatty acid (steric acid), the H/C values of bio-fuel was increased, while O/C values was decreased. The reduction of oxygen atoms in the form of CO2 or CO was probably the main pathway during pyrolysis. It indicated that decarboxylation was main reaction. The results were agreed with our previous work [15,21]. Chen et al. also found during the pyrolysis of rapeseed meal, CO and CO2 were the major gas products [44]. According to the results in Fig. 8, it was confirmed that the quality of bio-fuel from POA outdone other bio-fuel from lignocellulose [43–45]. The dots with same slope in line indicated they are homologues series. Hence, according to the results in Fig. 8, the bio-fuel can be divided into different homologous series. The components of bio-fuel were centralized to about ten categories compounds. However, bio-fuel from lignocellulose contains too many different categories compounds [45]. The KMD versus nominal Kendrick mass can be drawn in Fig. 9 according to KMD definition [46]. Each successive data point in a horizontal row is attributed to the successive addition of a CH2 group. It indicated that every horizontal row pots were homologues. All of the assigned class species can be displayed in a Kendrick plot because each class has different KMD values. According to Fig. 9, it was found that the KMD value was centralized relatively, indicating that the chemical structure of the main components was similar. When additional double bond was found, KMD value shifted upward successively. Hence, according to the results shown in Fig. 9, the amount of saturated hydrocarbon in the bio-fuel was relatively low, which was in line with above results."
8,The properties of the bio-fuel as combustion fuel,"3.3 The properties of the bio-fuel as combustion fuel The present results confirmed that large amount of fatty acids was found in bio-fuel. Therefore, the acid value of bio-fuel recorded higher values (55.17 mg KOH/g) in comparison to the reference oil (Table 3 ). In addition, it was showed that the viscosity of bio-fuel (28.89 mm2/s) was higher than the petroleum-based diesel oil and reference bio-fuel, which was attributed to the presence of large amount of oxygen containing compounds. The density of bio-fuel was slightly higher than other tested samples. Interestingly, bio-fuel produced from POA showed a calorific value of 45.10 kJ/g, which was close to that of petroleum-based diesel oil (46 kJ/g) and have the potential to be used as combustion fuel."
9,Conclusions,"This work investigated the pyrolysis characteristic of plant oil asphalt. The following conclusions can be drawn: (1) Py-GC-MS results showed that alkane, alkene, alcohol, plant sterol derivative, fatty acid and other oxygen containing compounds were present in the pyrolysis products of POA. (2) ESI FT-ICR MS analysis confirmed that both hydrogenation and polymerization reactions took place during POA pyrolysis process, but the main reaction was decarboxylation except cracking. (3) According to van Krevelen diagram the nature of the bio-fuel, which chemical structure of the main components was similar, can be evaluated. (4) It was showed that acid value and viscosity of bio-fuel were higher than diesel oil and reference bio-fuel, but has a similar calorific value, rendering it a potential fuel for combustion applications."
