0,Introduction,"Fossil fuels (petroleum, natural gas, and coal) have been the major energy since the industrial revolution. The consumption of fossil fuels is increasing continuously, which promoted economic and social progress greatly in the world [1]. However, massive amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGs) were produced and emitted to the earth's atmosphere in the utilization of fossil fuels and the GHGs are the main causes of global warming. Climate change was generally recognized as a serious environmental problem caused by the excessive use of fossil fuels. In addition, burning fossil fuels also produced toxic gases such as SO2 and NO2 [2]. The limited fossil energy on earth cannot meet the complex demand of energy for human development. Pursuing regenerative and clean energy has become a hot research field. Biomass energy is one of the promising energy technologies. Biomass energy is a kind of renewable energy provided by biological organic plants which use biomass as a medium to store solar energy, such as terrestrial forests, agricultural plants [3]. Plants absorb as much carbon dioxide as they grow when they're produced during using biomass energy. Carbon balance is achieved in this process continuously cycles. In addition, nearly no poisonous gases are produced in the process of using biomass [4]. For all these reasons, it would help to reduce the temperature rise, maintain ecological stability and provide a healthy environment by using biomass instead of fossil energy. It is a focus of technology study that the conversion lignocellulosic biomass into high-value chemicals and sustainable fuels to reduce dependence on fossil energy. Lignocellulosic biomass is considered the most abundant sustainable carbon resource on the earth for the reason that its global production is more than 200 billion tons [5]. Lignocellulosic is believed to be the perfect alternative to fossil resources because of its high yield and low price. Lignocellulose consists of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, and cellulose accounts for the highest proportion of lignocellulosic, about 40–50 % and it is a linear polymer consisting of β-d-glucopyranose units linked via β-1, 4 glycosidic bonds [6,7]. The advantage of cellulose is simple construction and relative abundance compared with hemicellulose and lignin. Catalytic pyrolysis of cellulose is considered as one of the most feasible utilization thermochemical technologies to produce biofuels, and this method can produce the upgraded liquid fuels with satisfactory quality and high yields [8]. The bio-oil prepared by this technology has the competitive edges such as easy transportation, renewability and high energy density compared with direct-combustion technologies for biomass [9]. The unrefined pyrolysis liquid oil obtained from cellulose contains a lot of oxygen-compounds, causing its complex composition and low heating value. The disadvantages caused an obstacle of bio-oil to apply in current energy and material industries to some extent [10]. Removing oxygen from crude bio-oil is a key to bio-oil application. Long-chain hydrocarbons, especially alkanes are important chemical raw materials and modern fuels, which can be used in diesel and jet fuels. These products from renewable cellulose instead of fossil resources appealed to researchers around the world. This technology is considered to realize sustainable energy and chemical supply [11,12]. It is worth noting that there have been several researchers devoted to the conversion biomass into various alkanes, however, the established technological methods always require harsh conditions with high pressure hydrogen (H2 pressures ≥2 MPa) [13–15]. These process conditions caused mechanical equipment additional loss of the service life and excessive H2 consumption (≥3 M ratio of H2 per reactant). Many researchers focus on how to reduce hydrogen consumption and pressure for the producing alkanes [16–18]. To reduce hydrogen consumption and hydrogen pressure, two approaches have been adopted to solve the problem. One is the co-pyrolysis of biomass and olefin polymers, and another is the pyrolysis biomass with addition of low-pressure hydrogen. Xue et al. conducted catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of cellulose and PE in a micro-pyrolyzer using HZSM-5 as the catalyst, and they prepared aromatic hydrocarbons with the selectivity of 68 % [19]. Hydrodeoxygenation of cellulose pyrolysis using molybdenum oxide and low-pressure hydrogen was conducted by Nolte et al. and alkene yield and selectivity (among hydrocarbons) were 46 % and 64 %, respectively [20]. The above two methods both conducted pyrolysis cellulose with extra hydrogen source to prepare hydrocarbons. Titanium-silicalite-1 (TS-1) catalysts are crystalline microporous materials, and TS-1 has been widely applied in the adsorption, separation and catalyst due to their catalytic activity, shape selectivity, solid acidity and ion exchange capacity [21]. The structural character of TS-1 is an MFI-type zeolite with partial substitution of titanium atoms for silicon atoms, which offers high catalytic activity in a reaction containing oxygen, and TS-1 had been applied to epoxidize alkene and alkane [22,23]. TS-1 loaded with Au metal has been applied for propylene epoxidation to prepare epoxy acetone in oxygen and hydrogen, the reaction equation is shown as follows: CH3CH = CH2+O2+H2=CH3−CHOCH2+H2O [24]. However, no researchers have applied TS-1 or modified TS-1 in catalytic upgrading of biomass vapors to prepare long-chain hydrocarbons liquid fuels under mild condition. Through the above analysis, harsh conditions with high pressure hydrogen is the main problem in the process of producing alkanes at present. In this work, TS-1 and Au/TS-1 catalysts were synthesized for catalytic upgrading of cellulose pyrolysis vapors via Py-GC/MS to convert unrefined pyrolysis vapors into long-chain alkanes. Catalysts were characterized to explore the main factors such as specific surface area, surface acidity etc. how to contribute to the production of long-chain alkanes. Finally, model compounds including glucose, methyl alcohol and pentane were used discuss the possible reaction pathways. The advantage of this research is to reduce hydrogen consumption and to make the production of alkanes can be realized under mild condition. It offers a possible route to product alkanes from biomass with a more environmentally friendly and safer method."
1,Experiment,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation 2.1.1 Synthesis of TS-1 Hydrothermal method was used to synthesis Titanium silicalite-1 (TS-1). Basically, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), tetrabutyltitanate (TBOT), tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) and H2O were mixed under stirring in a molar ratio of 1:0.04:0.4:40. After TEOS and TBOT hydrolyzed completely at 60 °C in water bath, the solution was warmed up to make the alcohols produced by hydrolysis reaction of TEOS and TBOT evaporate. The solution was placed in Teflon autoclave at 170 °C for 48 h to produce TS-1. The obtained TS-1 was washed, dried and calcined at 550 °C for 8 h in a muffle furnace to eliminate template remaining in the pore. 2.1.2 Synthesis of Au/TS-1 HAuCl4·3H2O was dissolved in the 100 mL deionized water, then the solution was taken into the flask, followed by the addition of 1 g TS-1. After the mixture was stirred for 5 h, the gold particles were synthesized by reduction reaction with a quantity of sodium borohydride solution. After cleaning and drying, Au/TS-1 catalyst was obtained."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were conducted by Micromeritics ASAP 2020 plus. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was obtained using a Rigaku Ultima IV apparatus with Cu Kα radiation (λ =0.15406 nm). HRTEM images were taken in a JEM-2010FEF electron microscope operating at 200 kV accelerating voltage. Before the experiment, the sample was dispersed in water and then the sample was deposited onto a copper grid. NH3 temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) profiles was obtained on an Autosorb-IQ-C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on a photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Escalade 250Xi) to analyze the surface electronic states. C1s line at 284.6 eV was calibrated. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) was used to determine the content of Au by Pe Avio200."
4,Pyrolysis experiments,"2.3 Pyrolysis experiments The pyrolysis experiment was carried out in a Rx-3050TR series reactor pyrolyzer with direct connection to a GC–MS (Agilent, GC8890, MS5977B). Fig. 1 . shows that reactor contains two parts: the 1st reactor was used to place a sample cup with cellulose and the 2st reactor was used to place a quartz tube loaded with catalyst. The internal diameter quartz tube was 3 mm and the length of the quartz tube was 78 mm. The sample mass of cellulose was 0.5 mg, and the height of catalyst bed was 2 mm, 4 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm and 10 mm, corresponding to the mass of TS-1 being 7.3 mg, 14.7 mg, 22.5 mg, 30.2 mg, and 38.2 mg, and the mass Au/TS-1 being 7.6 mg, 15.3 mg, 22.6 mg, 30.9 mg and 38.5 mg, respectively. When the temperature of the two sections reached the set temperature, the sample cup loaded with cellulose will drop in the pyrolyzer manually and the cold trap and GC–MS began to work automatically. The pyrolysis time was 0.5 min in each test."
5,Product analysis,"2.4 Product analysis After catalytic cracking, the upgraded products were condensed by cold trap and then heated to analyze the detailed chemical compounds. Rtx-5 MS with 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm was used to separate the products. The oven temperature was heated to 50 °C for 2 min., then increased to 200 °C with heating rate of 5 °C/min, finally it was heated to 280 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min and held for 2 min.. The selectivity was calculated with Area Normalization Method on Qualitative analysis software from Agilent Technologies."
6,Selection of pyrolysis temperature,"2.5 Selection of pyrolysis temperature Fig. 2 shows the TG and DTG curves of cellulose pyrolysis under the N2 atmosphere. The weight of cellulose decreased a little below 300 °C and the weight loss of cellulose is mainly in the range of 300–350 °C. From the DTG curve, it can be seen that the maximum weight loss peak is 350 °C. With the further increase of temperature, the mass change is not obvious and the final mass of residue is 11 %. Based on the pyrolysis property of cellulose, the pyrolysis temperature was set from 350 °C to 750 °C. To filter out the best temperature for TS-1 catalyst in this reaction system, different catalytic temperature including 200 °C, 300 °C, 400 °C and 500 °C, were selected and the height of the catalyst bed was 2 mm. The mass ratio of the TS-1 to cellulose was about 15:1. As shown in Fig. 3 , the main products from cellulose pyrolysis were glucoses accounting for 80 % of pyrolysis product, so that the conversion of glucose can be used as valuation criteria. At the temperature of 200 °C, 300 °C and 400 °C, the obtained chromatograms results were almost identical and it was an obvious peak of glucose. However, when the catalytic temperature is 500 °C, the chromatogram peak is different from other temperature. Moreover, the peak of glucose disappeared and many other peaks appeared. This suggests that glucose can be converted into other compounds when the temperature is 500 °C."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of TS-1 and Au/TS-1 catalyst,"3.1 Characterization of TS-1 and Au/TS-1 catalyst Fig. 4 a shows that the presence of micropores in TS-1 can be observed due to the rapid elevation of the curve at P/P0 < 0.02 [25]. The isotherms curve shows that TS-1 is belongs to type IV with a H4 hysteresis loop, suggesting the presence of mesopores of TS-1. Rich porous structure is conducive for the diffusion of molecules. At P/P0 = 0.42, there is curve abrupt closure on the desorption branch, which confirms the presence of intra-crystalline voids accessible only via entrances smaller than 4.0 nm [26]. After loading with Au over TS-1, the isotherms are similar with TS-1, suggesting that Au loading will not affect the textural properties of TS-1 significantly. Table 1 shows that Au loading leads to the decreases of specific surface area from 394 m2/g to 351 m2/g. The pore volume shows no change and remains at 0.24 cm3/g. During the preparation of Au/TS-1 catalysts, gold ions deposited on catalyst surface of TS-1 were reduced to gold particles, and some gold particles caused the small pores on TS-1 to be partially blocked, leading to the reduction of specific surface area. Fig. 5 is the XRD patterns of TS-1 and Au/TS-1. Five characteristic peaks at 14.6°, 22.9°, 23.1°, 23.7° and 24.2° on TS-1 are attributed to the indices of the [200], [002], [310], [221] and [102] planes, respectively. This indicates that TS-1 is a typical MFI structure with orthorhombic symmetry and highly crystalline [27]. A sharp peak at 24.2° suggests that Ti exists in the framework [28]. The absence of crystalline TiO2 proved by the no significant diffraction peak was observed at 2θ of 25.4° [29]. The curve of Au/TS-1 shows the same characteristic diffraction peaks except the additional diffraction peaks at 38.2°, which indicates that the MFI structure has not changed and Au has been loaded into TS-1. The decrease of peak intensity on Au/TS-1 is attributed to a reduction of crystallinity. The average particle size of gold calculated by Sheryl formula is 9 nm. Fig. 6 shows two representative TEM images of the Au/TS-1, and the scale bars are 10 nm and 20 nm, respectively. To accurately calculate the particle size of gold, the two images both were chosen to analyze. It can be found that most gold particles are concentrated at 5−12 nm, a few particles are less than 2 nm, and a maximum particle stretched to 28 nm, due to the generation of gold congeries particles. The average size of gold particles calculated by two different scale bars are 8.7 nm and 8.9 nm, respectively. Those gold particles with a small size can fully play its role during the catalytic pyrolysis. The gold loading amount was concluded by ICP, the result was shown in Table 2 . 0.071 g Au/TS-1 catalyst was weighed and dissolved in aqua regia, then solution was transferred to a 25 mL volumetric flask and diluted 50 times. The test result was 0.3 mg/L, and the calculation result was Au% = 0.3 mg/L×25 mL × 50÷1000÷01,071 g × 100 % = 0.5 %. The acidic properties of TS-1 and Au/TS-1 are shown in Fig. 7 . TS-1 and Au/TS-1 both only contain weak acid centers (<300 °C), and the peaks are at 95 °C and 87 °C over TS-1 and Au/TS-1, respectively, indicating the acidic properties of catalysts is changed obviously. Compared with the curve of TS-1, the peak of weak acid centers shifts to low temperature Au/TS-1. Supported Au metal consumed some of the acid sites on TS-1, leading to the decrease in peak areas of weak acid centers [30]. The chemical state of Au was analyzed by XPS measurement and the Au and Ti shifts of electron binding energy was discussed. The survey spectrum and the core level of Ti 2p are shown in Fig. 8 (a) and Fig. 8(b), and the core level of Au 4f in Au/TS-1 is shown in Fig. 8(c). The XPS survey spectrum reveals that the TS-1 contains the Ti, Si, and O elements. Au element can be detected on Au/TS-1. The surface atom percent content of four elements is shown in the Table 3 . After Au loading, the surface Si/Ti atom ratio increases from 31 to 33. The Si/Ti atom ratio in TS-1 and Au/TS-1 were both more than 25, suggesting more Ti atoms existed in the framework of TS-1 than surface. In the Fig. 8(b), Ti 2p3/2 peak for the TS-1 and Au/TS-1 samples are found to be symmetric at the binding energy of 459.0 eV, assigned to the tetrahedral Ti(IV), which demonstrates that almost only framework Ti species existed [31–33]. The core level spectra of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 in TS-1 is at the binding energy at 459.2 eV and 464.9 eV, respectively. After the Au loading, peaks shifted slightly to lower binding energy, and the peaks of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 are at 458.5 eV and 464.2 eV, respectively. The peak shift confirmed that the bond strength of Ti–O slightly changed by the incorporation of Au [34]. In addition, the decrease in peak area of Ti 2p3/2 peak was probably due to the formation of framework Au–O–Ti [35]. As shown in Fig. 8(C), Au 4f spectra displays two peaks at 83.5 eV and 87.6 eV, respectively, which are correspond to metallic Au0. The presence of Au0 demonstrates that the Au3+ was completely reduced [36]."
9,Catalytic activity,"3.2 Catalytic activity Catalytic fast pyrolysis of cellulose experiments over TS-1 and Au/TS-1 were conducted via Py-GC/MS. Fig. 9 shows chromatogram results over different catalysts and five representative compounds are listed in the Table 4 . There is a significant difference among three chromatograms and representative compounds. Without the addition of catalyst, the main pyrolysis product of cellulose is glucose. In Fig. 10 (a), TS-1 catalyst bed height plays an important role in changing the products distribution. Without the addition of catalyst, the selectivity of glucose is the highest being 83 %, and furans accounts for 5%. All pyrolysis products are oxygen-containing compounds, and no alkanes or hydrocarbons are formed in the products. Glucoses, the highest selectivity component in the absence of catalyst, disappeared when the catalyst bed was 2 mm, but the oxy-compounds were still 100 %. With the increase of bed height, the selectivity of oxy-compounds gradually drops, the selectivity of oxy-compounds had fallen to the lowest when the bed height was 8 mm, about 60 %. However, with the further increase the bed height to 10 mm, the selectivity of oxy-compounds remained unchanged, and the selectivity of hydrocarbons kept unchanged. This suggests that TS-1 molecular has the property of deoxidization, and the deoxidization capability enhanced with the amount of TS-1 catalyst increases. The selectivity of furans first increased and then decreased, and it reached maximum being 42 % when the bed height was 6 mm. The furans were obtained from intramolecular dehydration of glucoses [37] over TS-1 catalyst (at the range of bed height was 0 mm–6 mm). The selectivity of furan increased, suggesting that the deoxidization was in the form of water over TS-1. However, when the TS-1 catalyst bed was 8 mm or 10 mm, the dehydration property was too strong to keep the selectivity of furans growing, and the hydrocarbons and alkanes increased. Compared to TS-1, Au/TS-1 catalyst shows different product selectivity, however the catalytic bed has little impact on the products distribution, the result was shown in Fig. 10(b). As same as TS-1, glucoses were converted completely when the catalyst bed was only 2 mm, and the selectivity of oxy-compounds was only 21 %. It can be found that the selectivity of hydrocarbons increased significantly to 80 %, alkanes accounting for 90 % of the hydrocarbons. Significantly, the selectivity of furans dropped from 5% to 0% immediately, and remained stable with the further increase of bed height. This suggests that furans could be converted with the addition of Au/TS-1. It can be seen from the five curves in Fig. 10(b) that the selectivity of five representative products almost has no change when the bed height increases from 2 mm to 10 mm, and the selectivity of hydrocarbons and alkanes fluctuate within 2%. The phenomenon demonstrates the loading of Au greatly enhanced deoxidization capability of TS-1. Fig. 11 shows the carbon number distribution of alkanes, and the obtained alkanes are all long-chain alkanes. The main product from cellulose pyrolysis was glucose, about 83 %. Only 6 carbon atoms exist in a glucose molecule, but the carbon atoms of alkane products are more than 10. The conversion process suggests that the Au/TS-1 has the property to catalyze the linkage of two molecules or more, which is probably due to the dehydration property of Au/TS-1. It is not the same reaction pathway as furans formation of intramolecular dehydration, but intermolecular dehydration [38]. The hydroxyl of the glucose reacted with hydrogen from the methyl to form water, so the long chain s of hydrocarbons formed [39]. Fig. 12 shows the effect of the pyrolysis temperature on the product selectivity over Au/TS-1 with a catalyst bed height of 2 mm. The highest selectivity of alkanes is 76.7 % at 450 °C, and then the selectivity increases with the increase of pyrolysis temperature. When the pyrolysis temperature is 650 °C and 750 °C, the selectivity of alkanes is 61.9 % and 61.8 %, respectively. The selectivity of hydrocarbons gradually decreases with the increase of pyrolysis temperature, and the selectivity of oxy-compounds increases gradually. The selectivity of hydrocarbons and oxy-compounds at 750 °C is 65.9 % and 34.1 %, respectively. It also can be found that glucoses and furans in the investigated temperature cannot be detected, which suggests that Au/TS-1 is contributed to the conversion of glucoses and inhibits the formation of furans."
10,Possible upgrading mechanism,"3.3 Possible upgrading mechanism The presence of Au/TS-1 catalyst is contributed to the dehydration of glucoses and carbon chain growth, and finally leading to the production of long-chain alkanes. During the pyrolysis of cellulose, glucose is the main pyrolysis products, and its relative content decreases significant over Au/TS-1. This suggests that the addition of Au/TS-1 is contributed to the further conversion of glucose to form long-chain alkanes. To prove this hypothesis, glucose was chosen as a model compound to conduct the pyrolysis experiment. Fig. 13 shows chromatogram result from non-catalytic and over Au/TS-1 and five representative compounds are listed in the Table 5 . The obtained carbon number distribution is shown in Fig. 14 . Glucose molecule contains six carbon atoms, the carbon number of pyrolysis product is focused on 6, and the selectivity is more than 80 %. However, the carbon number of products over Au/TS-1 is in the range of 5−30. The selectivity of the products with carbon number less than 6 only accounts for 15 %. This experimental phenomenon confirmed that the Au/TS-1 had the property to combine two or more glucose molecules to form long chain compounds. The formation of long-chain alkanes shows that the Au/TS-1 catalyst has the capability of deoxidization and carbon chain elongation. Au/TS-1 has been applied for propylene epoxidation to prepare epoxy acetone [40]. Based on the analysis, it speculated that the long-chain alkanes generated from that hydroxyl of the glucose reacted with hydrogen from methyl to form water, and the remaining two parts combined together to form long-chain alkanes. The hydroxyl and hydrogen source were supplied by the products from cellulose pyrolysis [41]. To verify the feasibility of the reaction methanol and pentane were selected to be the model of hydroxyl and hydrogen sources to conduct catalysis experiment. As shown in Fig. 15 , peaks of methanol and pentane can be found in the GC spectra, and peak at 1.8 min is the hexane. This result confirms that the carbon chain growth occurs over Au/TS-1 via dehydration between methanol and pentane. The experimental result showed that it was a possible pathway that the long-chain alkane can be generated by a hydroxyl reacting with a methyl and form water. Based on the above analysis, it can be concluded that a hydroxyl of the glucose reacted with hydrogen sources to form water, while the remaining two parts are combined to form long-chain alkanes. The possible reaction pathway is shown in Scheme 1 . The process of cellulose deoxidation could be divided into two steps: the first step is the generation of CO, CO2 and H2O via pyrolysis of cellulose, and the second step is hydroxyl reacted with hydrogen sources to form water over Au/TS-1. The ring opening of glucoses over Au/TS-1 to generate A with three hydroxyls [42,43], which reacted with hydrogen to form alkanes with 10 carbon atoms, then the alkanes reacted with A to form alkanes with a longer carbon chain. On the other hand, methyl of A reacted with hydroxyls of A to form B , and B reacted with hydrogen to form long chain alkanes. It is also possible that the methyl of A reacted with the other hydroxy to form different long-chain compound with B , and then generated corresponding alkanes. In the process of reaction, carbon chains were broken down irregularly in the coordinate effects of high temperature and catalyst, formed long-chain alkanes with different carbon atoms."
11,Conclusion,"In this study, TS-1 and Au/TS-1 catalysts were synthesized and applied to catalytic cellulose pyrolysis vapors. The effect of catalyst height and pyrolysis temperature on the selectivity of product was investigated. The possible upgrading mechanism over Au/TS-1 was discussed. It is shown that Au particles uniformly distributed on the surface of TS-1 and crystal of TS-1 is not changed by loading Au. Glucose as mainly pyrolysis product of cellulose was successfully converted into hydrocarbons, especially long-chain alkanes. The selectivity of long-chain alkanes over Au/TS-1 with a catalyst bed height of 2 mm is 76.7 % at 450 °C. The increase of pyrolysis temperature decreases the selectivity long-chain alkanes, and increase of catalyst be height has little effect on the products distribution. The experiments on model compounds revealed that Au/TS-1 has the catalytic property of increase carbon chain length by intermolecular dehydration. This research provides a new method to produce long-chain alkanes under mild condition without extra hydrogen source under and atmospheric pressure."
