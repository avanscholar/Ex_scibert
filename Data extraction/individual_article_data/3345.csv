0,Introduction,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a typical greenhouse gas, and its concentration has risen rapidly, from ~ 280 ppm before industrial revolution to ~ 390 ppm in 2010, and predicted to reach ~ 570 ppm by the end of this century [1]. Such massive emission leads to global climate change and temperature increase in the past decades. Therefore, one of the major imperatives for the 21st century is the control of CO2 emission and its conversion to valuable fuels or chemicals. A net-zero fuel economy could be realized if emitted CO2 can be efficiently transformed to valuable carbon-containing fuels such as alcohols, hydrocarbons and formic acid (FA) [1–9]. Among them, FA is an attractive liquid product, which not only exhibits important applications in leather tanning, animal feed additives, and silage preservation [10], but also acts as an excellent carrier for hydrogen storage [11,12]. The direct gas-phase hydrogenation of CO2 into FA is thermodynamically unfavorable (ΔG = 33 kJ mol−1), but this reaction can occur in aqueous phase (ΔG = −4 kJ mol−1) [13] and the reactivity could be further promoted with the addition of bases to produce formate [2,5,14]. Although the catalytic transformation of CO2 hydrogenation into FA using homogeneous catalysts, including Ir, Ru and Rh [15–17], has exhibited high reaction rates, it is severely limited due to costly and tedious separation steps for catalyst recycling. Therefore, the development of efficiently heterogeneous catalysts has aroused considerable interests. Among various systems, Pd-based catalysts are promising for this reaction, which has been investigated for more than a century [18–35]. Recently, supported Pd catalysts using carbon-based materials such as carbon, active carbon (AC), and carbon nitride were found to be very active for this reaction [23–29]. For instance, a Pd/AC catalyst reported by Su et al. [24] exhibited superior performance for formate production with TOFs up to 527 h−1 in a NaHCO3 solution and 1103 h−1 in a NH4HCO3 solution. In addition to carbon-based materials, the use of metal oxides also exhibits great potential due to their high stability and versatile redox and acid-base properties. Previously, we have identified the density and strength of basic sites in metal oxide supports (i.e. CeO2 and ZnO) as the key roles in CO2 activation and reaction mechanism [30]. Moreover, the crystal phase and crystal plane structures of metal oxide supports were also engineered to optimize the catalytic performance [31,32], while the production rate of FA or formate is still inferior. CeO2 has been widely used as catalyst or support in hydrogenation reactions such as CO2 hydrogenation, H2 generation, and the hydrogenation of different functional groups [36–39]. Due to the rich and well-controlled morphologies, various CeO2 nanocrystals including rods (r-CeO2), cubes (c-CeO2), octehedra (o-CeO2), and polyhedra (p-CeO2) can be successfully synthesized [40,41], and thus the CeO2 morphology effect in CeO2-based catalysts has been extensively investigated [38,42–52]. It has been revealed that the metal-CeO2 interaction in CeO2 supported catalysts can be tuned by engineering the CeO2 morphologies, which plays a key role in determining the catalyst structures and catalytic performance. For instance, on Au/CeO2 catalysts, Si et al. [51] found surface defect-rich r-CeO2 can stabilize and activate Au, leading to the higher catalytic activity of Au/r-CeO2 catalyst than other CeO2-supported Au catalysts. Morphology effect of the ceria in Pd/CeO2 catalysts was also investigated in oxidative reactions [52]. PdxCe1-xO2-σ solid solution was dominantly formed on Pd/r-CeO2 and Pd/c-CeO2 catalysts, contributing to the high activity of CO oxidation, while Pd/o-CeO2 catalyst mainly formed PdO nanoparticles (NPs), contributing to the high activity of propane oxidation. Therefore, a more efficient supported Pd catalyst in CO2 hydrogenation reaction could be developed by engineering the morphology of employed CeO2 support. In this study, various Pd/CeO2 catalysts with ca. 2 wt% Pd loading and r-CeO2, c-CeO2, and p-CeO2 as the supports were prepared via a deposition - precipitation method. Ceria morphology-dependent Pd-CeO2 interaction and catalysis in CO2 hydrogenation into formate have been identified. It was found that the oxygen vacancies in ceria strongly affect the metal-CeO2 interaction, leading to the variations of particle size and electronic structure of the Pd species. Metallic Pd species can efficiently facilitate the activation of H2, and thus the Pd/p-CeO2 catalyst with the highest content of metallic Pd species exhibits the best intrinsic activity in the formate production. These findings clearly demonstrate the morphology effect of CeO2 on the structures and catalytic performance of Pd/CeO2 catalysts, and nicely reveal a powerful strategy to acquire efficient Pd-based catalysts via the oxide morphology engineering."
1,Experimental section,"All the chemicals and reagents, including Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, NaOH, PdCl2, Na2CO3, NaHCO3, and absolute ethanol were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. and used without further purification. Commercial CeO2 polyhedra (denoted as p-CeO2) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich.

Deionized water with resistance > 18.5 MΩ was used."
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Synthesis of CeO2 cubes and rods followed the procedure reported by Mai et al. [41]. Typically, 30 mL of NaOH aqueous solution (14.07 mol L−1) was added dropwise to 40 mL of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O aqueous solution (1.43 mol L−1) under continuous stirring at room temperature. After stirring for another 0.5 h, the mixed solution was transferred into a 100 mL of Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and hydrothermally treated at 100 °C and 180 °C for 24 h to synthesize CeO2 cubes and rods, respectively. After the hydrothermal treatment, the system was cooled down to room temperature. The resulting precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washing with deionized water and absolute ethanol for several times, and then dried in vacuum at 80 °C for 16 h. Finally, the solid was calcined in a muffle oven at 500 °C for 4 h. The acquired CeO2 cubes and rods were denoted as c-CeO2 and r-CeO2, respectively. The Pd/CeO2 catalysts were synthesized via a deposition- precipitation method. Typically, 300 mg of as-synthesized CeO2 solid was ultrasonically dispersed in 100 mL of deionized water and then heated to 50 °C under stirring. Then an aqueous solution of PdCl2 was added into and the nominal Pd loading is 2 wt%. After stirring for 10 min, the pH value of the mixture was adjusted to 10 by the addition of Na2CO3 aqueous solution (1 mol L−1) under continuous stirring. The mixture was stirred at 50 °C for another 3 h and the resulting solid was collected by centrifugation and washing with deionized water and absolute ethanol for several times, and then dried in oven at 60 °C for 12 h. Finally, the solid was calcined in a muffle oven at 350 °C for 2 h and subsequently reduced in 5% H2/N2 with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 at 200 °C for 1 h to acquire Pd/CeO2 catalysts. Various Pd/CeO2 catalysts with different CeO2 morphologies were prepared in the same manner, and the calcined catalysts (without pre-reduction) were denoted as Pd/r-CeO2-C, Pd/c-CeO2-C and Pd/p-CeO2-C, and the pre-reduced catalysts were denoted as Pd/r-CeO2, Pd/c-CeO2 and Pd/p-CeO2."
3,Catalyst characterizations,"2.2 Catalyst characterizations Specific Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of various CeO2 and Pd/CeO2 catalysts were measured on a Beckman Coulter SA3100 surface area analyzer. Prior to the measurement, the sample was degassed at 150 °C for 5 h. The Pd contents in the Pd/CeO2 catalysts were determined by an Optima 7300DV inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). Power X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of various CeO2 and Pd/CeO2 catalysts were conducted on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with a nickel-filtered Cu Kα (λ = 0.15418 nm) radiation source operated with an operation current of 50 mA and an operation voltage of 40 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of various CeO2 and Pd/CeO2 catalysts were conducted on an ESCALAB 250Xi instrument with a monochromatized Al Kα (hν = 1486.7 eV) excitation source. The likely charging of samples was corrected by setting the binding energy of the adventitious carbon (C1s) to 284.8 eV. Laser Raman spectra of the CeO2 and Pd/CeO2 catalysts were obtained using a LABRAM-HR Confocal Laser Raman spectrometer with the excitation lines at 532 and 325 nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the CeO2 and Pd/CeO2 catalysts were acquired on a JEM-2100F high resolution transmission electron microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the catalyst were recorded on an ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer equipped with a reaction chamber, using a monochromatic Al anode Kα radiation (1486.6 eV), and the charging effects were corrected by adjusting the C1s binding energy of the adventitious carbon to 284.8 eV. Prior to the measurement, the catalyst was pre-reduced in 5% H2/N2 with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 for at 200 °C 1 h in the reaction chamber and then cooled down to room temperature, followed by directly transfer to analysis chamber without being exposed to the air. CO chemisorption, H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2 - TPR), and CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO2 - TPD) experiments were conducted on a Micromeritics Autochem 2920 apparatus. In CO chemisorption experiment, 50 mg of calcined catalyst (Pd/CeO2-C) was loaded in a U-shape quartz microreactor and then in situ reduced at 200 °C by 5% H2/Ar (30 mL min−1) for 1 h. Next, the system was purged at 200 °C by high purity He (30 mL min−1) for another 1 h and subsequently cooled down to room temperature. The catalyst was then exposed to a mixture of 5% CO/He with at least 20 pulses till no CO adsorption was observed. In H2-TPR experiment, 30 mg of calcined catalyst (Pd/CeO2-C) was loaded in a U-shape quartz microreactor and then heated at a rate of 10 °C min−1 under 5% H2/Ar (30 mL min−1). The H2 consumption was recorded by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). In CO2-TPD experiment, prior to the measurement, 100 mg of calcined catalyst (Pd/CeO2-C) was in situ reduced and then purged at 200 °C in high purity He with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 for another 1 h. After the sample was cooled down to room temperature, it was exposed in high purity CO2 (30 mL min−1) for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently purged by high purity He (30 mL min−1) for another 1 h. Finally, the acquired sample was heated at a rate of 5 °C min−1 in high purity He (30 mL min−1) and the CO2 desorption signal was recorded by a TCD detector. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transformed spectroscopy (DRIFTS) experiments were conducted on a Nicolet iS50 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a MCT/A detector and an PIKE DRIFTS accessory. All the spectra were collected with 256 scans and a resolution of 4 cm−1. Prior to measurement, 50 mg of the calcined Pd/CeO2-C catalyst was in situ reduced at 200 °C by 5% H2/N2 for 1 h and then purged by high purity N2 at 200 °C for another 30 min to acquired Pd/CeO2 catalyst. For in situ DRIFTS of CO adsorption experiments, the in situ reduced Pd/CeO2 catalyst was exposed to high purity N2 (50 mL min−1) at room temperature and the collected spectrum was taken as the background. Then 10% CO/N2 (50 mL min−1) was introduced to the reaction cell for 30 min till saturation. For in situ time - resolved DRIFTS spectra of CO2 hydrogenation experiments, the in situ reduced Pd/CeO2 catalyst was exposed to high purity N2 (50 mL min−1) at 40 °C and the spectrum was taken as the background. Subsequently, the catalysts were exposed to a mixture of CO2 + H2 (CO2:H2 = 1:1, 50 mL min−1). The spectra were serially recorded in the presence of the CO2 + H2 mixture for 30 min. For in situ time-resolved DRIFTS spectra of first CO2 and then CO2 + H2 (CO2:H2 = 1:1) experiments, the spectrum in high purity N2 (50 mL min−1) at 40 °C was recorded as the background. High purity CO2 (25 mL min−1) was first introduced to the reaction cell. The DRIFTS spectra under CO2 atmosphere were serially recorded for 30 min. Subsequently, high purity H2 (25 mL min−1) was further added in the feed, resulting a mixture of CO2 + H2 (CO2:H2 = 1:1, 50 mL min−1). Correspondingly, the spectra were serially recorded for another 30 min."
4,Catalytic performance evaluations,"2.3 Catalytic performance evaluations The CO2 hydrogenation experiment was conducted in an autoclave. The reaction mixture contained 5 mg of Pd/CeO2 catalyst, 168 mg of NaHCO3, 2 mL of deionized water, 1 MPa H2 and 1 MPa CO2. The reaction was conducted at 40 °C for 1 h. The products were analyzed by the anion chromatography and quantified based on a standard curve plotted according to the measured areas of formate by the anion chromatography as a function of formate concentrations. The turnover frequency (TOF) value of formate production (molformate molsurf. Pd −1h−1)) was calculated based on the following equation: TOF = Mol Formate Pd Surf . ∗ T = Mol Formate Pd total ∗ D i s p e r s i o n ∗ T where MolFormate refers to moles of produced formate, Pdsurf. refers to moles of surface Pd atoms, Pdtotal refers to moles of total Pd atoms, Dispersion refers to Pd dispersion, and T refers to reaction time. The apparent activation energies (Ea) of various Pd/CeO2 catalysts were conducted using the same procedure as the test of catalytic activity under different reaction temperatures. The CO2 conversions were controlled below 15%, which is much lower than the equilibrium conversion. Reaction orders of CO2 and H2 of various Pd/CeO2 catalysts were conducted using the same procedure as the test of catalytic activity. The reaction order of H2 was acquired by keeping the NaHCO3 mass of 168 mg and the CO2 pressure of 1 MPa but varying the H2 pressure from 0.5 to 2 MPa. According to previous results [24,30], bicarbonate species was regarded as the true precursor for the production of formate from CO2 hydrogenation. Thus, the reaction order of CO2 was conducted by changing the added mass of sodium bicarbonate. The reaction order of CO2 was acquired by keeping the H2 pressure of 1 MPa and CO2 pressure of 1 MPa but varying the NaHCO3 mass from 16.8 to 67.2 mg. The CO2 conversions were controlled below 15%."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterizations of the catalysts,"3.1 Characterizations of the catalysts The BET surface areas of the r-CeO2, c-CeO2, and p-CeO2 are 69, 23 and 60 m2 g−1, respectively (Table 1 ). From the TEM images shown in Fig. 1 A1-C1, it can be seen that the morphologies and size distributions of the CeO2 oxides are quite uniform, agreeing with the previous results [38,45–50]. The lattice fringes of 0.19, 0.27, and 0.31 nm in the HRTEM images (Fig. 1A2-C2) correspond respectively to CeO2{110}, CeO2{100}, and CeO2{111} (JCPDS card No. 34–0394) crystal planes of r-CeO2, c-CeO2, and p-CeO2. These findings also match well with many previously reported results that CeO2(110) crystal plane is mostly presented on r-CeO2, CeO2(100) crystal plane is exclusively presented on c-CeO2, and CeO2(111) crystal plane is mostly presented on p-CeO2 [38,45–50]. The CeO2-sopported Pd catalysts were prepared via a deposition - precipitation method and subsequently reduced in 5%H2/Ar at 200 °C for 1 h. The actual Pd contents determined by ICP-AES are 2.01, 1.98 and 1.97 wt% in the Pd/r-CeO2, Pd/c-CeO2, and Pd/p-CeO2 catalysts, respectively (Table 1). The Pd contents are quite close to the nominal values, indicating that the Pd species were completely deposited on the CeO2 supports. The BET surface areas are 70, 25 and 59 m2 g−1 for the Pd/r-CeO2, Pd/c-CeO2, and Pd/p-CeO2, respectively (Table 1). Furthermore, the original CeO2 morphologies in the Pd/CeO2 catalysts (Fig. 1D1-F1) can be well retained, suggesting the structures of the CeO2 supports remain intact during the preparation of Pd/CeO2 catalysts. Their corresponding HRTEM images (Fig. 1D2-F2) reveal an additional lattice fringe of 0.22 nm labeled in yellow circle, which belongs to the spacing of Pd(111) (JCPDS card No. 65–2867) crystal plane. In the enlarged TEM images (Fig. 2 A1-C1 and Fig. S1), the Pd nanoparticles (NPs) could be easily identified on the catalysts. The Pd NPs are completely located on the CeO2 supports in the cases of Pd/r-CeO2 and Pd/c-CeO2 catalysts, but partially outside the CeO2 support over Pd/p-CeO2 catalyst, likely due to ultrasonic dispersion treatment before the TEM measurement. This suggests that the interaction between Pd species and p-CeO2 should be weaker than that between Pd species and r-CeO2 or c-CeO2. The Pd NP size distributions, determined by counting no less than 200 NPs in the enlarged TEM images, are 1.7 ± 0.4, 2.5 ± 0.4, and 2.8 ± 0.4 nm for the Pd/r-CeO2, Pd/c-CeO2 and Pd/p-CeO2 catalysts, respectively Fig. 2A2-C2). Fig. 2A3-C3 shows the CO chemisorption results. The Pd dispersion based on the CO uptake follows an order of D Pd/r-CeO2 (57.6%) > D Pd/c-CeO2 (42.3%) > D Pd/p-CeO2 (38.4%), corresponding to average Pd sizes of 1.9, 2.6 and 2.9 nm, respectively. These values are very close to those obtained based on TEM images (Fig. 2A2-C2). According to literature, a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) can induce the fabrication of smaller metal NP and higher metal dispersion [45,53]. Therefore, these results suggest that the strongest MSI appears on the Pd/r-CeO2, while the interactions on the Pd/c-CeO2 and Pd/p-CeO2 are relatively weaker. The XRD patterns show only cubic fluoride CeO2 crystal phase in all CeO2 and Pd/CeO2 catalysts (Fig. 3 A), no Pd-associated diffraction patterns appear due to the highly dispersed Pd NPs. The relative intensities of different peak signals in various CeO2 and Pd/CeO2 catalysts are normalized by the intensity of CeO2{111} facets in XRD patterns (Table S1). Compared to standard PDF card (No. 34–0394), the intensities of CeO2{200} facets prominently increase over both c-CeO2 and Pd/c-CeO2 catalysts, in consistent with the results of c-CeO2 nanocrystals exclusively exposing with {100} facets. In addition, all of the CeO2 and Pd/CeO2 catalysts exhibit increasing intensity of CeO2{220} facets. This is likely due to the disordered arrangement of particle in powder catalysts, leading to the crystallographic orientations of CeO2{220} more exposed outside. Therefore, the relative intensities of observed diffraction peaks vary among different samples is likely due to the different orientations of CeO2 nanocrystals (single crystal particles) in these catalysts. The crystallite sizes of the CeO2 can be calculated based on the Scherer equation (Table 1) quantitatively but not qualitatively, which agrees with the microscopic characterizations. Moreover, the similar crystallite sizes of the CeO2 in all Pd/CeO2 catalysts compared to the corresponding CeO2 supports further confirm that there is no structural change after Pd deposition. In addition, the lattice parameters of the Pd/CeO2 catalysts are slightly larger than those of the corresponding CeO2 supports (Table 1), suggesting migration of some Pd species into the CeO2 lattice, leading to the lattice expansion. Raman spectroscopy excited by 532 nm laser (denoted as Vis-Raman) was employed to probe the oxygen vacancies in the CeO2 and Pd/CeO2 catalysts. As shown in Fig. 3 B and C, all the CeO2 and Pd/CeO2 catalysts exhibit two vibrational bands, a strong band at 464 cm−1 and a weak band at around 595 cm−1, which correspond to the F2g and defect-induced mode (D) of the cubic ceria fluoride phase, respectively [54,55]. The ID/IF2g ratios were calculated to estimate the oxygen vacancy concentrations of the CeO2 in the catalysts. The ID/IF2g values of various CeO2 supports (Table 1) follow an order of r-CeO2 (0.04) > c-CeO2 (0.02) > p-CeO2 (0.01), consistent with previously reported results. After Pd loading, the ID/IF2g ratios remain the same order but all the values increase obviously (Table 1), due to the formation of Pd-Ce-O solid solution (as evidenced by the expansion of CeO2 lattice parameters, Table 1) and/or the promoted reduction of CeO2 by the Pd addition. These results demonstrate that the oxygen vacancy concentrations present an order of rods > cubes > polyhedra either in the CeO2 supports or in the Pd/CeO2 catalysts. Raman spectra excited by 325 nm laser (denoted as UV-Raman) and ex situ Ce 3d XPS spectra were employed to probe the oxygen vacancy concentrations in the surface and near-surface regions. In the UV-Raman spectra of various CeO2 supports (Fig. 4 A), in addition to the bands at 438 and 594 cm−1, a new band at around 800 cm−1 is observed, which can be attributed to the OO stretching vibration of peroxide species (O2 2−) adsorbed on isolated two-electron surface defective sites [56]. The ID/IF2g values of various CeO2 supports in the UV-Raman spectra follow the same order as in the Vis-Raman spectra, but their values are higher. This is mainly due to a stronger absorption capacity of CeO2 in the UV laser region, leading to a more surface sensitivity in UV-Raman spectra than in Vis-Raman spectra. Thus, the oxygen vacancies in the CeO2 supports are enriched in the surface and near-surface regions. For the Pd/CeO2 catalysts (Fig. 4B), the UV-Raman spectra do not change much and the calculated ID/IF2g values are slightly lower than those of the corresponding CeO2 supports. These observations fully demonstrate that, on the one hand, the increased oxygen vacancy concentrations in the Pd/CeO2 catalysts should mostly locate in the bulk region beyond the detection depth of UV-Raman spectroscopy. On the other hand, the Pd species are likely loaded on the surface defective sites of CeO2, causing the decline of surface oxygen vacancy concentrations. As reported in many works [38,44–50], XPS spectroscopy is more surface sensitive and the Ce(III) contents derived from the fitted Ce 3d XPS spectra can also reflect the surface oxygen vacancy concentrations. Consistent with previous results [38,44–50], the Ce(III)/Cetotal ratios in the CeO2 catalysts follow an order of r-CeO2 (11.8%) > c-CeO2 (10.5%) > p-CeO2 (9.6%) (Fig. 4C, Table 1 and Table S2). After the loading of Pd (Fig. 4D and Table S2), this order remains, similar to the UV-Raman results. However, the Ce(III)/Cetotal ratios in various Pd/CeO2 catalysts are much larger than those in corresponding CeO2 catalysts (Table 1), indicating the former occupies higher surface oxygen vacancy concentrations, inconsistent with the UV-Raman results. This is likely due to a deeper detection of XPS spectroscopy than UV-Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, the exact numbers of oxygen vacancy, calculated based on the Ce(III) content in Ce 3d XPS spectra and the assumptions of r-CeO2, c-CeO2, and p-CeO2 exclusively enclosed with CeO2{110}, CeO2{100}, and CeO2{111} crystal planes, are prominently highest for both r-CeO2 and Pd/r-CeO2 catalysts (Fig. S2). The above Raman and Ce 3d XPS spectra results clearly demonstrate that both the total oxygen vacancy concentrations (detected by Vis - Raman) and the surface oxygen vacancy concentrations (detected by UV - Raman) of the CeO2 follow the same order of rods > cubes > polyhedra, which are consistent with previous experimental results and DFT calculations that the oxygen vacancy formation energy of CeO2 surfaces follows an order of {110} > {100} > {111}. It is widely reported that the MSI can be promoted by surface defects of metal oxide supports [45–47,57,58]. For example, Chen et al. [57] reported that the defect - rich TiO2-{100} and TiO2-{101} supports exhibit stronger MSI than the defect - deficient TiO2-{001} support, which can not only stabilize flat Ru nanoparticles, but also lead to electronic modifications of Ru surface atoms. Consequently, highly active and stable Ru/TiO2-{100} and Ru/TiO2-{101} catalysts in CO methanation reaction are fabricated. Similar results were also observed over Cu/CeO2 catalysts [58]. Ning et al. found that defect - rich CeO2 rods can remarkably promote the copper - ceria interaction, leading to the formation of more Cu(I) species at the copper - ceria interface due to charge transfer and thus the best activity for CO oxidation. Therefore, these results suggest that the strength of Pd-CeO2 interaction may follow the same order as the oxygen vacancy concentrations, i.e. Pd/r-CeO2 > Pd/c-CeO2 > Pd/p-CeO2, agreeing well with the microscopic results. The electronic properties of the Pd species in the catalysts were further probed by XPS spectra without exposure to air and in situ DRIFTS of CO chemisorption. In the Pd 3d XPS spectra (Fig. 5 A and Table S3), two symmetric components with Pd 3d5/2 binding energies of 335.7 and 337.4 eV are observed on all the Pd/CeO2 catalysts, which typically arise from Pd(0) and Pd(II) features, respectively. The appearance of Pd(II) feature should result from Pd atoms located on the Pd-CeO2 interface involved a charge transfer from Pd to CeO2. Notably, the Pd(II)/Pdtotal ratio of various Pd/CeO2 catalysts follow an order of Pd/r-CeO2 (12.1%) > Pd/c-CeO2 (8.6%) > Pd/p-CeO2 (7.9%) (Table 1). This finding further confirms a stronger MSI between Pd and r-CeO2, leading to the formation of finer Pd particle size and more Pd(II) species in the Pd/r-CeO2 catalyst, similar to the reported results of more surface oxygen vacancies created by reduction in a glovebox, leading to the formation of atomically dispersed Pd species via the Pd cations interacting with the surface oxygen vacancies [59]. In the in situ DRIFTS of CO chemisorption (Fig. 5B), four CO adsorption peaks at 2084, 2035, 1970, and 1880 cm−1 are observed on the Pd/CeO2 catalysts, which are commonly assigned to CO linearly bonded to Pd(111) facets, CO linearly bonded to Pd NP corners, µ2 bridge-bonded CO on the Pd NPs edges/corners, and CO bonded to 3-fold Pd(0) sites, respectively [60,61]. No feature of CO adsorption on Pd(II) is observed in the DRIFTS spectra, which is likely due to weaker CO adsorption capacity of Pd(II) species than metallic Pd, and/or lower Pd(II) content and thus the high Pd(II) signal in the ex situ Pd 3d XPS spectra should mostly arise from the oxidation of Pd NPs after catalysts exposure to air. In addition, the ratio of CO adsorbed on linear and bridged/3-fold Pd sites follows an order of Pd/r-CeO2 (2.43) > Pd/c-CeO2 (1.70) > Pd/p-CeO2 (1.31), suggesting the particle size of Pd on the Pd/r-CeO2 catalyst is smaller than those on the Pd/c-CeO2 and Pd/p-CeO2 catalysts [31,62], consistent with the microscopic results"
7,Reaction performance of the catalysts,"3.2 Reaction performance of the catalysts Catalytic evaluations of the Pd/CeO2 catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation into formate were conducted in a high-pressure batch reactor in the presence of sodium bicarbonate under 1 MPa H2 and 1 MPa CO2 at 40 °C. Since the bare CeO2 supports are inactive (Table S4), the reaction behaviors of the Pd/CeO2 catalysts can be compared on the basis of Pd contents. Normalized by the Pd loading, the formation rates of formate are slightly different over various Pd/CeO2 catalysts (Fig. S3), while the difference is significant when turnover frequencies (TOFs) based on Pd dispersions are compared. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the TOFs follow the order of Pd/p-CeO2 (746 h−1) > Pd/c-CeO2 (532 h−1) > Pd/r-CeO2 (425 h−1). These results clearly identify the p-CeO2 supported Pd as an efficiently active catalyst for the production of formate from CO2 hydrogenation, and fully demonstrate the oxide morphology engineering as a powerful strategy for the development of highly active heterogeneous catalysts [63–65]. The apparent activation energies (Ea) of the Pd/CeO2 catalysts for the reaction were derived from the Arrhenius plots (Fig. 6B and Fig.S4). Due to the low CO2 conversion levels (less than15%), the thermodynamic equilibrium and mass transfer limitations can be ignored in the system. The calculated Ea values are slightly different over the Pd/CeO2 catalysts and that of the Pd/p-CeO2 catalyst (ca. 23.8 kJ mol−1) is lower than those on the Pd/c-CeO2 (ca. 28.7 kJ mol−1) and Pd/r-CeO2 (ca. 35.4 kJ mol−1) catalysts. These results further confirm that the Pd/p-CeO2 catalyst is more intrinsically active in the reaction. Kinetic investigations were further conducted. According to the previous results [24,30], bicarbonate species was regarded as the true precursor for the production of formate from CO2 hydrogenation. Thus, the reaction order of CO2 was conducted by changing the added mass of sodium bicarbonate. As shown in Fig. 6 C and D, the reaction orders of CO2 on the Pd/CeO2 catalysts (Fig. 6C and Fig. S5) are similar, exhibiting a positive order of ca. 0.5, while those of H2 are different (Fig. 6D and Fig. S6), following an order of Pd/p-CeO2 (ca. 0.57) < Pd/c-CeO2 (ca. 0.78) < Pd/r-CeO2 (ca. 0.93). This suggests that the catalytic performance of the Pd/CeO2 catalysts are closely related to the reaction order of H2. It has been reported that metallic Pd species is more favorable for the dissociation of H2 than positively-charged Pd species [30,31]. Since the Pd/p-CeO2 catalyst contains the highest content of metallic Pd species (Table 1 and Fig. 5 A), the surface coverage on the catalyst could be the highest and thus the lowest reaction order of H2. As a result, the Pd/p-CeO2 catalyst exhibits the highest production rate of formate. It has been well recognized that the adsorption/activation of CO2 and H2 are relevant to the structures of support and Pd, respectively. In our case, the structures of the CeO2 supports, responsible for the adsorption/activation of CO2, are significantly different but the reaction orders of CO2 are similar on all the Pd/CeO2 catalysts. This suggests that either the key factor determining the activation and reactivity of CO2 is unaffected by the CeO2 morphologies or the rate-determining step of this reaction is not related to the activation of CO2. Moreover, the Pd electronic structures, responsible for the adsorption/activation of H2, are also different over various Pd/CeO2 catalysts. The Pd/r-CeO2 catalyst exhibits a finer and more positively - charged Pd species but lower activity, indicating that positively - charged Pd species are unfavorable for CO2 hydrogenation into formate, consistent with the previous reports [30,31]. In order to further clarify the activation and reaction behaviors of CO2 and H2 over various Pd/CeO2 catalysts, CO2 - TPD and H2 - TPR measurements were conducted. It has been widely reported the activation and reactivity of CO2 could be boosted by the catalyst surface basicity, especially the weak basic sites, which can be measured by CO2 - TPD experiments. As shown in Fig. 7 A, similar desorption peaks of CO2 centered at ca. 80 °C are observed on the Pd/CeO2 catalysts, indicating they have basic sites with similar strength (denoted as weak basic site). The desorption intensity of CO2 normalized by the specific BET surface area, reflecting the density of weak basic sites, follows an order of Pd/r-CeO2 > Pd/c-CeO2 > Pd/p-CeO2, which is opposite to the catalytic activity (Fig. 6A). These results indicate that the adsorption and activation of CO2 may not be the rate-determining step of the reaction, which is consistent with the kinetic results. The H2 - TPR experiments were conducted on the calcined Pd/CeO2-C catalysts and the profiles are shown in Fig. 7B. An intense reduction peak centered at 64 °C, ascribed to the reduction of PdO species [32,66], is only observed on the Pd/r-CeO2-C catalyst. No PdOx - related reduction peak is observed on either Pd/c-CeO2-C or Pd/p-CeO2-C catalyst due to the reduction of PdO species at ambient temperature in reductive atmosphere, frequently observed on Pd-based catalysts [30,66]. This indicates the dissociation of H2 and then reacting with PdO over Pd/r-CeO2-C catalyst, responsible for the activation and reactivity behaviors of H2, is much weaker than those over the Pd/c-CeO2-C and Pd/p-CeO2-C catalysts. This provides a potential evidence to interpret the higher reaction order of H2 and lower formation rate of formate on the Pd/r-CeO2 catalyst. In addition, a weak reduction peak is observed at high temperature (centered at ca. 300 °C) over all the Pd/CeO2-C catalysts, which can be ascribed to the reduction of surface - capping oxygen of ceria promoted by the hydrogen spillover effect from Pd atoms to the support [30,46]. The areas of this reduction peak of the catalysts follow an order of Pd/r-CeO2-C > Pd/c-CeO2-C > Pd/p-CeO2-C, agreeing with their surface areas. The reaction behaviors of the catalysts were systematically studied by in situ DRIFTS spectra. Assignments of the vibrational bands of different surface species are summarized in Table S5 [30,31,67–70]. Fig. 8 shows the in situ time-resolved DRIFTS spectra of CO2 mixed with H2 (CO2 : H2 = 1 : 1) at 40 °C, simulating the working state. Similar vibrational features were observed on various Pd/CeO2 catalysts, mainly including monodentate carbonate (1357–1371 and 1506–1510 cm−1), bidentate carbonate (labeled in red words), bicarbonate (labeled in blue words), and formate (labeled in pink words), accompanied by weak formations of bridged carbonate (1208–1215 cm−1), polydentate carbonate (1466 cm−1), and unassigned carbonate (1339–1341 cm−1). However, their ratios are significantly different. The intensity ratios of formate in the total carbonaceous species over the catalysts follow an order of Pd/p-CeO2 (ca. 49.1%) > Pd/c-CeO2 (ca. 47.6%) > Pd/r-CeO2 (ca. 36.7%). This order is generally consistent with that of the catalytic performance (Fig. 6A) while the differences between Pd/c-CeO2 and Pd/r-CeO2 catalysts are minute, suggesting not all the carbonaceous species taking part in the catalytic reaction. In addition to formate species, bidentate carbonate and bicarbonate species are other two major components, especially on the Pd/c-CeO2 and Pd/r-CeO2 catalysts. It has been proposed that such species could be the key intermediates of CO2 hydrogenation into formate [30,31]. Therefore, the intensity ratios of formate/(bidentate carbonate + bicarbonate + formate) over various catalysts follow an order of Pd/p-CeO2 (ca. 69.4%) > Pd/c-CeO2 (ca. 59.2%) > Pd/r-CeO2 (ca. 40.7%), matching well with their activities. These results suggest that the different reaction behaviors of the Pd/CeO2 catalysts likely come from the hydrogenation process of bidentate carbonate and bicarbonate species into formate, instead of the fabrications of bidentate carbonate and bicarbonate species from CO2 interacting with the supports, which is consistent with the kinetic results. Subsequently, the stepwise treatments of various Pd/CeO2 catalysts by first CO2 and then CO2 + H2 (CO2 : H2 = 1 : 1) were conducted. As shown in Fig. 9 , compared to corresponding catalyst under working state (Fig. 8), similar surface carbonaceous species are generated on the Pd/CeO2 catalysts under pure CO2 atmosphere (Fig. 9A1-C1), further demonstrating that the rate - determining step on the Pd/CeO2 catalysts is the hydrogenation of carbonaceous intermediates to formate but not the activation of CO2. When H2 was co-fed in the stream (Fig. 9A2-C2), the intensities of the bidentate carbonate and bicarbonate species gradually decrease on the catalysts, accompanied by the generation of formate species. This provides a solid evidence that bidentate carbonate and bicarbonate species acting as active intermediates of formate production on various Pd/CeO2 catalysts. In addition, the apparently initial decline of formate species on the Pd/r-CeO2 catalyst after the H2 introduction (Fig. 9A2) should arise from the significant decrease of bicarbonate species."
8,Conclusions,"In summary, by employing Pd/CeO2 catalysts with different CeO2 morphologies (rods, cubes, and polyhedra), we have successfully identified ceria morphology-dependent Pd-CeO2 interaction and catalytic performance of Pd/CeO2 catalysts in CO2 hydrogenation into formate. Via a combination of microscopic and spectroscopic characterizations, we demonstrate that the MSI is determined by the oxygen vacancy concentrations of the ceria, which follow the order of rods > cubes > polyhedra either in CeO2 or in Pd/CeO2 catalysts. The stronger MSI on the r-CeO2 leads to finer Pd particle size and more positively-charged Pd species generated over the Pd/r-CeO2 catalyst. The electronic structure of Pd significantly affects the catalytic performance of CO2 hydrogenation into formate, in which the activation and reactivity of H2 are facilitated by metallic Pd species. As a result, the Pd/p-CeO2 catalyst with the highest content of metallic Pd species gives the best intrinsic activity for formate production. Moreover, the reaction mechanism was comprehensively investigated by in situ DRIFTS spectra, which clearly reveals that the carbonaceous intermediates (bidentate carbonate and bicarbonate species) hydrogenation is the rate-determining step. These results, on the one hand, greatly deepen the fundamental understanding of CO2 hydrogenation into formate catalyzed by Pd/CeO2 catalysts, on the other hand, nicely demonstrate the oxide morphology engineering as a powerful strategy in developing efficient Pd-based catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation."
