0,Introduction,"Increasing consumption of oil and gas based fossil fuels following the increasing annual world population has led to the release of environmental pollutants; especially CO2, which is the main factor for global warming. Hence, the traditional energy resources need to be replaced by clean, renewable, and available sources such as sun, wind, and hydrogen [1]. Hydrogen is known as an alternative affordable clean fuel for the future. It is (i) an abundant molecule in earth (forms more than 90% of the existing atoms), (ii) a light weight molecule with high energy density, which is higher than those of all fossil fuels, (iii) a fuel with no release of harmful gases (iv) a sustainable, non-toxic and eco-friendly energy carrier since it produces water as a by-product [2]. However, the extraction and storage of hydrogen are tough and complicated due to its pure form, which is rare on the earth and is usually found in various compounds [3]. Therefore, different efficient methods such as electrolysis, thermochemical process, thermolysis, photoelectrochemical, photocatalytic water splitting, etc. are utilized for hydrogen production [4] The electrochemical, photocatalytic, and hydrolysis of hydrides techniques are reviewed in this paper. Produced hydrogen storage is the main factor in hydrogen energy systems. Hydrogen storage techniques are classified into two groups: physical and material based methods. Physical methods are based on compressing and liquefaction of hydrogen while in material based technique, the decomposed hydrogen atoms are stored due to their physical and chemical interaction with compounds. The main challenge in physical methods is controlling the temperature and pressure. In chemical interaction, hydrogen atoms are unified with chemical structure of materials while in physical interaction hydrogen is adsorbed using porous materials with high surface area. So the material-based methods are low cost and fast and require compounds with high surface areas [5]. Fig. 1 illustrates the classification of hydrogen storage methods. Biopolymers are produced using living organisms such as plants, animals, and microorganisms. They consist of linear chain like or branched/cross-linked structured molecules. These environmentally and cost efficient macromolecules are classified into two main groups: biodegradable and non-biodegradable [6]. One of the most impressive biodegradable biopolymers are polysaccharides, which are derived from plants (as main sources) and animals. Polysaccharides are composed of repeating monosaccharide units (general formula Cn(H2O)n). Their physicochemical properties include average molecular weight, composition, and series of monosaccharides, and positions of glycosidic linkages. In addition, polysaccharides have potential biomedical and industrial applications [7–11]. Cellulose, chitin, chitosan, alginate, starch, gum, and pectin have been known as polysaccharides. The various types of polysaccharides are composed of carboxyl, amino, and hydroxyl groups, which help their interaction with other compounds. In addition, polysaccharides are the most used polymeric carbon derivatives, which have attracted a lot of attention in the synthesis of different types of compounds [12,13]. Other types of biopolymers are proteins. Collagen and gelatin are the types of animal proteins that have attracted a lot of attention. Therefore, polysaccharides and proteins can be used for hydrogen production and storage due to the interaction between their functional groups and H2O [14] and can act as a carbon source for efficient syntheses in the hydrogen production field [15–17]. Biocompatibility, non-toxicity, and ecofriendly nature are the most important in biomedical applications such as drug delivery, tissue engineering, wound healing, and prosthetics [18–21]. In addition, biopolymers are available, biodegradable, and economical compounds, which are widely used in industrial applications such as dye removal, greenhouse sorption, heavy metal ion adsorption, food packing, and development of electronic devices [22,23]. Cellulose, with a crystalline structure, is an abundant and widely used biopolymer on the earth with repeating anhydrous d-glucose monomers [24,25]. Chitin, extracted from crustaceans shells, is the second most low cost, renewable, and available natural linear polymer after cellulose [26]. Chitosan, a derivative of chitin, is a linear, biocompatible, and non-toxic copolymer [27]. Chitin and chitosan are the most functional biopolymers in the food industry, water treatment, biomedicine, etc. [28]. Alginate is a significant anionic copolymer, which contains mannuronic acid (M block) and guluronic acid (G block) sequences. This hydrophilic biopolymer can be extracted from the cell walls of brown algae. It can be employed in the food industry and biomedical applications; especially drug delivery, due to its specific biological and structural characteristics [29,30]. Starch is a cheap and biodegradable carbohydrate found in plants and fruits. This natural polysaccharide glucose unit is connected by glycosidic bonds and is used in different industries [31]. Collagen is one of the basic structural animal proteins present in tendons, ligaments, and skin. Collagen structure is uncommon and contains three polypeptide chains [32]. Gelatin, obtained from collagen by thermal hydrolysis, is a water soluble and pure protein. Gelatin is a high molecular weight polypeptide and has been applied in food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and photographic fields [33]. Gums are a category of hydrocolloids and are extracted as crude materials from vegetables. These polysaccharides are widely used in food industries. Moreover, their biological features such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-toxicity, stability and high flexibility are advantageous in biomedical and cosmetic industries [34,35]. Pectin is a highly complex polysaccharide found in plant primary walls. It produces the color range of white to light brown powder and is the most suitable polysaccharide used as a stabilizer and gelling factor in the food industry [36,37]. Here, hydrogen evolution using biopolymer-based (nano)catalysts will be reviewed. The next section explains three methods for hydrogen evolution by biopolymer-based (nano)catalysts including electrochemical, photocatalytic, and hydrolysis of hydrides. The main discussion; that is, the application of biopolymer-based (nano)catalysts for hydrogen evolution, is offered in the last section."
1,Electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction,"Electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is one of the most convenient, cost efficient and cleanest methods for pure hydrogen production from water dissociation. Generally, electrochemical HER studies use cyclic voltammetry (CV) and potentiometry [3]. HER process can be carried out in two media, acidic and alkaline, by three reactions: Volmer, Heyrovsky, and Tafel [38–40]. In the first step (Volmer reaction), water decomposition occurs due to exerting potential and the produced hydrogen atoms are adsorbed on the electrode surface by electrical polarization. (1) H 2 O + M + e − ⇄ MH ads + OH − In alkaline mediums (2) H + + M + e − ⇄ MH ads In acidic mediums where M is the host material. Afterwards, the adsorbed hydrogen atoms recombine to form gaseous hydrogen due to the Tafel reaction or hydrogen molecule via the decomposition of hydrogen atoms from water molecule. (3) 2MH ads ⇄ H 2 g + 2 M (4) MH ads + H + + e − ⇄ M + H 2 g In acidic mediums (5) MH ads + H 2 O + e − ⇄ M + H 2 g + OH − In alkaline mediums Overpotential and Tafel plot are two important electrochemical parameters for the evaluation of HER catalytic activity, which are explained as follows: ❖ Overpotential is an extra potential, which causes reaction at a determined rate. This important parameter usually consists of concentration and electrochemical overpotentials, which result from concentration and electrochemical polarizations, respectively. Excellent HER catalytic performance is obtained in small overpotentials. Electrochemical and concentration polarizations can be reduced using a suitable electrocatalyst and increasing ion diffusion rate, respectively [41]. ❖ The Tafel curve slope is a practical analysis for investigating the reaction kinetics of HER, which can be evaluated from linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) or CV tests. Tafel slope is specified by Tafel equation: (6) log I = log I 0 – 2.3 / b ɳ where I is current density, I0 is current in equilibrium potential, b is Tafel slope and ɳ is overpotential. Tafel slope is defined by the linear values at low overpotential fitted to Eq. (6) [39,41]. Briefly, a worthy HER catalyst is a host with a large number of empty active sites and high stability in the electrolyte medium [42]. Moreover, small overpotential and low Tafel slope show high HER catalytic activity of the electrode. A schematic of the electrochemical HER using electrochemical cell was shown in Fig. 2 ."
2,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction,"Photocatalytic technique is another promising clean route for sustainable hydrogen production, which has several advantages including cost-efficiency, facilities, and suitability for residential applications. One chemical reaction occurs during the photocatalytic HER, which changes light irradiation to the chemical energy of a photocatalyst [43]. Briefly, photocatalytic HER can be performed in three steps: (i) Excitation of the valence band (VB) electron and its transition to the conduction band (CB) when the irradiation energy is higher than the photocatalyst band gap and subsequent formation of electron (e−)-hole (h+) pair. (ii) Separation of e− and h+ and their migration to the surface of the photocatalyst. (iii) Reduction of adsorbed H+ to H2 by electrons as well as oxidation of water to oxygen by holes formed in VB. Three steps were schematically shown in Fig. 3 . Accordingly, H2 production occurs via the following redox reactions: (7) 2H 2 O → O 2 + 4H + + 4e − Oxidation E 0 = 1.23 eV (8) 2H + + 2e − → H 2 Reduction E 0 = 0.00 eV (9) 2H 2 O + 2O 2 → 2H 2 Overall E 0 = − 1.23 eV The structure of the photocatalyst remains unaltered if equal numbers of consumed e− and h+ are utilized. The CB must have an energy level lower than 0 V (E(H+/H2)) for HER to occur. Moreover, the reduction reaction occurs if the VB energy level is greater than 1.23 V (E(O2/H2O)) [44,45]. The application of some photocatalysts for H2 production by this method has some limitations such as fast recombination of electron-hole pair, high thermodynamic potential barriers and low surface reaction rate, which can be resolved by the addition of efficient compounds such as non-metallic, metallic and semiconductors to photocatalysts [44]."
3,Hydrolysis of hydrides for hydrogen production,"Hydrolysis is one of the interesting hydrogen generation techniques with high purity. Metals, metal hydrides, and chemical hydrides are efficient hydrolysis compounds, which can produce pure hydrogen by reaction with water. Although LiB4, LiH, LiBH4, LiAlH4, NaAlH4, NaBH4, Al, Mg, and MgH2 are used hydrolysis raw materials, hydrolysis of NaBH4 is a widely used reaction for hydrogen generation due to its safety and controllability [46,47]. The hydrolysis of boron hydrides (KBH4, NaBH4 and NH3BH3) by biopolymer-based catalysts has been performed for hydrogen production and the hydrolysis mechanism is described by the following equations [48–50]: (10) NaBH 4 + 2H 2 O → NaBO 2 + 4H 2 (11) KBH 4 + 2H 2 O → KBO 2 + 4H 2 (12) NH 3 BH 3 + 2H 2 O → NH 4 + + BO 2 − + 3H 2 As shown in Fig. 4 , the mechanism of hydrogen production using hydrolysis of NaBH4 and NH3BH3 is as follows: Firstly, the separated BH4 − is placed in two active sites (AS) and AS-BH3 − and AS-H form. The electron is then transferred from BH3 − to AS. Afterwards, the reaction between BH3 − and OH− forms BH3(OH)−. After repeating these steps, BH3(OH)− releases three hydrogen atoms and changes to B(OH)4 −. Likewise, a hydrogen atom is produced from a water molecule due to the electron transition from AS. Similarly, hydrogens can be generated by hydrolysis of NH3BH3 and KBH4 molecules [49]. The produced hydrogen can be measured by studying the weight changes or volume of extraction water in a beaker. In addition, hydrogen generation can be evaluated by the real hydrogen flow measured by a digital hydrogen mass flow meter [51]."
4,Application of biopolymer-based (nano)catalysts for hydrogen evolution,
5,Cellulose-based (nano)catalysts,"5.1 Cellulose-based (nano)catalysts Cellulose with the chemical formula of (C6H10O5)n is a linear homopolysaccharide formed of β-D-anhydroglucopyranose units and has a hydrogen bond due to the electrostatic forces between hydrogen and oxygen atoms, which causes reduction of cellulose solubility in polar solvents [24,52]. Cellulose is the most abundant organic polymer on the earth and is known as a renewable resource for fuel industrials. Four different types of cellulose can be produced from different natural and chemical sources, as shown in Fig. 5 [53,54]. In addition, nanocelluloses with desirable properties are an interesting category of polymeric compounds for science and industry, which are classified into three types: cellulose nanofibrils, cellulose nanocrystals, and bacterial cellulose [55]. The composites based on nanocellulose are practical in some medical fields such as drug delivery, cancer therapy, bone regeneration, and wound dressing [24]. In addition, nanocellulose materials, which are nanocarbon-based compounds with a high surface area, can be used as carriers of nanoparticles (NPs) or a source for the synthesis of catalysts in the hydrogen production process. According to the reports, a combination of cellulose with semiconductors such as TiO2 and Cds can provide an efficient photocatalyst for hydrogen production from aqueous solutions [56–59]. Moreover, the application of cellulose modified with NPs as a catalyst has been studied for hydrogen production by hydrogen evolution reaction [60–62]. Furthermore, cellulose can be used as a renewable catalyst for hydrogen production from NaBH4 methanolysis [63–65]. 5.1.1 Cellulose-based (nano)catalysts for electrochemical hydrogen evolution In 2012, Xu et al. reported the fabrication of a catalytic membrane electrode via electrospinning of cellulose acetate (CA) with polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), carboxylated multi-wall carbon nanotubes (cMWCNTs), and the diiron mimic of the subunit of the [FeFe]‑hydrogenase, Fe2. The structure of the compound and the image of electrospun-fiber membrane (EFM-Fe2) are shown in Fig. 6 . The catalyst was utilized to reduce proton and hydrogen evolution in water with an acetic acid solution. The electrode showed considerable improvement in stability in acidic solution and against repeating the scanning cycle [66]. Ji et al. prepared polyacrylonitrile/cellulose acetate (PAN/CA) carbon nanofibers through free-surface electrospinning method, followed by carbonization of PAN/CA nanofibers in 2017. The pores and channel structures of PAN/CA CNFs (CACNFs) can be controlled by modifying the weight ratio of PAN and CA. Thereupon, binder free Fe3C incorporated in Fe/N doped CACNFs films (Fe-CACNFs) were synthesized based on the porous CACNFs (1:1 PAN/CA CNFs). The preparation process and image of Fe-NFF are shown in Fig. 7a and b, respectively. The produced Fe-NFF was stabilized at 280 °C and the Fe-CACNF was obtained by carbonization at 800 °C in N2 atmosphere (Fig. 7c-f). The porous channel rich structures, the prominent electrical conductivity of the carbon fibers, the formation of more active sites, and rapid mass transportation for interface reactions lead to superior catalytic activity and great stability for HER (overpotential of 440 mV at current density of 80 mV/cm2 and over 100,000 s catalytic stability) in alkaline medium (1.0 M KOH) [67]. Huang et al. reported the synthesis of N-doped 2D carbon nanosheets by hydrothermal carbonization of a biomolecule (guanine) and different carbohydrates (glucose, cellulose, and fructose) as carbon precursors in 2017. The HER activity of these catalysts was studied in an alkaline medium (1 M KOH). The Cel/Gu-HTC-1000 catalyst functioned well. However, it was the least powerful catalyst compared with the other catalysts prepared. Among (Cel/Gu-HTC-1000), glucose-based (Glu/Gu-HTC-1000) and fructose-based (Fru/Gu-HTC-1000) catalysts, cellulose-based catalysts had the least HER activity. (Fru/Gu-HTC-1000 > Glu/Gu-HTC-1000 > Cel/Gu-HTC-1000). The Tafel slopes of these catalysts to achieve 10 mA/cm2 were 108, 121, and 117 mV/dec for (Cel/Gu-HTC-1000), (Glu/Gu-HTC-1000), and (Fru/Gu-HTC-1000), respectively [68]. In 2015, Gue et al. investigated the growth of MoS2 NPs on bacteria cellulose-derived carbon fibers foam (MoS2/CNFs) as binder free electrodes for HER electrocatalysis in an acidic medium. The synthesis process is schematically depicted in Fig. 8 . MoS2/CNFs electrocatalyst shows excellent catalytic performance in the HER process and excellent stability after 1000 cycles with a current density, Tafel slope, and overvoltage of 16 mA/cm2, 44 mV/dec and 120 mV, respectively [69]. Carbon nanoneedles (CNNs) were synthesized through a nanoreactor method in 2016 by Araujo and co-workers. The process uses purified cellulose nanowhiskers (CeNW) precursor obtained from acidic hydrolysis as the carbon source and loaded Ni, Cu, and Fe NPs on CNN. TEM images (Fig. 9 ) confirmed the whisker and needle like morphologies of CeNW particles and CNN, respectively. The catalytic performance of the synthesized samples in HER has been investigated via the Linear sweeping voltammetry (LSV) technique. Among all samples, CNN-Ni pyrolyzed at 1200 °C (CNN-Ni-1200) showed the best behavior as a catalyst in HER due to the large number of edge planes and graphite organization and in a lower level to metal dopants. The corresponding Tafel slope was calculated to be 142 mV/dec [70]. A carbonized bacterial cellulose/molybdenum diselenide (CBC/MoSe2) hybrid catalyst was prepared via high temperature carbonization and hydrothermal reaction by Lai et al. in 2017. Incorporating MoSe2 based electrocatalyst and carbonized bacterial cellulose nanofibers to anchoring the MoSe2 nanosheets on their surfaces resulted in forming a core-shell structure increment of active sites. CBC/MoSe2 hybrid electrocatalyst showed fast HER behavior and high stability with a current density, onset overpotential and Tafel slope of 87 mA/cm2, 91 mV and 55 mV/dec, respectively, in an acidic medium (0.5 M H2SO4) [71]. Mo2C@S-CA aerogels were fabricated via facile one-step carbonization reaction by Kong et al. in 2018, as shown in Fig. 10 . Cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) precursor, with a large number of sulfate esters, was employed to produce S-doped non-noble-metal electrocatalyst (Mo2C@S-CA) for HER process. The electrocatalytic activity of Mo2C@S-CA was studied in 0.5 M H2SO4. The hierarchical porous carbon structure and size of Mo2C NPs can increase HER electroconductivity and hydrogen production. Moreover, S-doped Mo2C@S-CA improves HER activity by providing more active sites. The Mo2C@S-CA catalyst exhibits noteworthy HER activity with low onset overpotential and Tafel slope of 176 mV and 66 mV/dec, respectively, at 10 mA/cm2 and high stability after 10,000 cycles under acidic conditions [62]. Growth of CoSe2 NPs on the bacterial cellulose-derived carbon nanofibers (CNFs) to synthesize CNFs/CoSe2 hybrids as an HER electrocatalyst was carried out using a one-pot hydrothermal reaction by Wei and co-workers in 2018. The CNFs/CoSe2 fabrication process is shown in Fig. 11 . The CNFs with 3D interwoven structure inhibited the aggregation of CoSe2 NPs and provided more active sites. In addition, it facilitates ion diffusion and charge transportation. The CNFs/CoSe2 electrocatalyst illustrated better HER performance than CoSe2 NPs with a low overpotential and a small Tafel slope of −119 mV and 54 mV/dec, respectively, at the current density of −10 mA/cm2 in an acidic medium (0.5 M H2SO4). The CNFs/CoSe2 showed excellent HER permanence after 100 h and 2000 cycles [72]. Idris and Devaraj utilized three different amounts of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as a biotemplate to synthesize mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (MGCN) in 2019. The MGCN prepared using 0.5 g of CMC (MGCN-0.5) with an overpotential of 272 mV/s at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 101 mV/dec showed better HER activity than the other composites of graphitic carbon nitride reported in the literature. Formation of more active sites due to higher surface area, more defects of MGCN-0.5 and a conductive pathway for electron transportation due to the higher amount of residual carbon led to the higher HER activity of MGCN-0.5 compared with the other samples prepared [73]. Metal semiconductor Mo/Mo2C/N-CNFs hybrids were synthesized via the carbonization of electrospun polyacrylonitrile/cellulose acetate/bis (acetylacetonate) dioxomolybdenum (PAN/CA/MoO2(acac)2) nanofibers by Li et al. in 2019. The synthesis technique and structure of the prepared sample are shown in Fig. 12 . The unparalleled porous, channel rich structure of the resultant electrocatalyst (Fig. 12b and c) and the side by side interlinking between Mo and Mo2C NPs (Fig. 12d) led to great HER performance at different pH values. The required overpotentials of Mo/Mo2C/N-CNFs-1 (with PAN and CA weight ratio of 1:1) to achieve the current density of 10 mA/cm2 were 175, 162, and 294 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1.0 M KOH, and 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS), respectively. The corresponding Tafel slopes were 64.6, 47.9, and 130.6 mV/dec, respectively [74]. The successful synthesis of a 3D porous CoNC@N-CNF via anchoring the CoNxC in 3D nitrogen doped porous carbon fiber, derived from the pyrolysis of BC and in situ nucleation growth of bimetal-ZIFs particles in the 3D porous network of BC was reported by Zhang et al. in 2020. The formation of the CoNC@N-CNF structure and its 3D network structure were confirmed by SEM and TEM images, shown in Fig. 13 . Fig. 13a and b show the SEM images of 3D porous structure of BC, which produced a rhombic dodecahedral ZIF-8/ZIF-67@BC by immersing in Zn2+, Co2+ and 2-MeIM in methanol solution (Fig. 13c and d). The CoNC@N-CNF with the same 3D nanostructure shape was produced by the pyrolysis of ZIF-8/ZIF-67@BC at 800 °C in N2 atmosphere (Fig. 13e and f). The TEM images in Fig. 13g and h show uniform distribution of Co NPs in the rhombic dodecahedral CoNC NPs and the fibers. The electrocatalyst showed outstanding activity in HER due to its 3D structure and increased active sites. The corresponding overpotential at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 was 107 mV with a Tafel slope of 111 mV/dec [75]. In 2021, cellulose-derived bamboo fibers (BF) with a three dimensional open network structure were used to synthesize cobalt substrates as catalysts for hydrogen production [76]. Electrochemical measurement was carried out in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte using a three electrodes setup containing graphite rod, Hg/HgO, and CoMo/Co-BF as the counter, reference and working electrodes, respectively. The overpotential was 46 mV at a current density of −10 mA/cm2, which is lower than those of Co/Co-BF (150 mV) and Mo/Co-BF (151 mV). Additionally, Tafel analysis was used to investigate the HER mechanism and the results indicated that CoMo/Co-BF electrode had a lower Tafel slope (96 mV/dec) compared with Co/Co-BF (125 mV/dec), Mo/Co-BF (198 mV/dec) and Co-BF (288 mV/dec) electrodes. Hence, the CoMo/Co-BF is a promising catalyst for HER. In another report, cellulose acetate (CA) was used as a carbon source to produce 3-dimensional hierarchical carbon nanostructures including carbon nanofibers (CNFs), electrospun carbon nanofibers (ECNFs), and Ni in 2021 [77]. A three electrode system including Pt and saturated calomel as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively, in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolytes was used for electrochemical characterization. The catalytic activity of the samples in KOH electrolyte was better than those in H2SO4 due to the damage of carbon structure in the acidic medium. Among the samples prepared, Ni/CNFs/ECNFs showed the lowest overpotential (88 mV) at a current density of −10 mA/cm2 in alkaline media due to its high surface area. In addition, the Tafel slope of Ni/CNFs/ECNFs was around 170 mV/dec. The performance of other cellulose-based (nano)catalysts for HER is summarized in Table 1 . 5.1.2 Cellulose-based (nano)catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution In 2015, Wang et al. prepared flexible and hierarchically porous nanocomposite foams (ZnxCd1-xS/BC) by solvothermal ion exchange/seeded growth in ethanol for visible light photocatalytic H2 production via water splitting for the first time. The process of water splitting by the as-prepared photocatalyst is shown in Fig. 14 . Zn0.09Cd0.91S/BC represented a high H2 evolution rate of 1450 mmol/h.g at 420 nm and favorable stability after 5 runs. The prominent photocatalytic performance of the sample was due to the surface area (101 m2/g), adequate band gap (2.33 eV), and low PL intensity [88]. Mesoporous chiral g-C3N4 (MCCN) was synthesized on chiral cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) through silica templating by Lin et al. in 2018. The mesoporous structure and high surface area of MCCN lead to its good photocatalytic activity and an ultrahigh hydrogen evolution rate of 219.9 μmol/h compared to the bulk g-C3N4 (54.9 times higher than bulk g-C3N4) under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) [89]. CdxZn1-xS-Gel photocatalysts were fabricated using carboxymethyl cellulose hydrogel and in situ chemical reactions by Wu et al. in 2018. The optimized Cd0.2 Zn0.8S-Gel photocatalyst had the best hydrogen production rate of 1762.5 μmol/g.h (104 times better higher than that of CdS) under visible light irradiation and showed excellent stability after 4 cycles [90]. Chemical cross-linking and in situ methods were utilized to form carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) gel membranes and loading CdS nanoparticles into the CMC gel, respectively, by Kang and co-workers in 2019. CdS/Pt-CMC catalyst was then synthesized by loading Pt co-catalyst particles into the membrane (Fig. 15 ). The performance of both photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution was studied. The CdS/Pt-CMC catalyst with 5 wt% Pt showed a hydrogen evolution rate of 1365 mmol/hg, which is 81 times greater than that of pure CdS due to providing active sites for hydrogen production by Pt. This report indicated that the CMC-based catalyst was stable after storage for nearly a month and had remarkable reusability [91]. In 2020, Sun et al. studied the capability of solar hydrogen evolution of highly porous nanopapers prepared via vacuum filtration of electrostatically self-assembled carbon nitride and nitrocellulose. The fabrication process is illustrated in Fig. 16 . The nanocellulose derived from garlic husk was used to obtain cellulose nanofibers (CNFs). The resulting g-C3N4/CNF (with g-C3N4 and CNF weight ratio of 1:3) hybrid nanopaper with tensile strength and Young's modulus of 18.5 MPa and 414 MPa, respectively, possessed a high hydrogen evolution rate of 3.9 mmol of the nano papers. After 4 cycles, no significant changes were observed in the photocatalytic activity and the nanopaper had reasonable photostability for 32 h [92]. 5.1.3 Cellulose-based catalysts in the hydrolysis of hydrides for hydrogen generation In 2016, Wang et al. reported the fabrication of palladium/polypyrrole (Pd/PPy) composite papers using cellulose fiber (CF) paper as a porous substrate. Pd NPs and PPy were decorated on the surface of CF papers by one pot synthesis in an aqueous solution at the same time. Pd2+ was reduced to Pd NPs by pyrrole monomers (Py) and simultaneously the polymerization of Py to PPy was initiated by Pd2+. Fig. 17 shows the TEM images of a nanofiber and Pd/PPy composite decorated on fiber. The hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane in the presence of Pd/PPy composite papers catalyst was improved. The H2 turnover frequency was 21.1 mol H2 mol Pd−1 min−1 with excellent stability at 293 K [93]. Sahiner and Demirci chemically modified microgranular cellulose using epichlorohydrin and diethylenetriamine in 2017. The obtained Cell-EPC-DETA catalyst with amine groups was protonated in 1.0 M HCl solution to form Cell-EPC-DETA-HCl catalyst. Furthermore, both catalysts were utilized in NaBH4 methanolysis for hydrogen production. Fig. 18 shows the optical microscopic images of protonated catalysts and the changes on their surface after modification. The amine groups generated positive charges, which can accelerate the interaction ability and catalytic activity. The same amounts of hydrogen (251 mL) were produced by the Cell-EPC-DETA Cell-EPC-DETA-HCl catalysts in 5 and 3 min, with calculated activation energies of 38.7 and 30 kJ/mol, respectively. Both catalysts had good stability after 5 runs and the Cell-EPC-DETA-HCl catalyst exhibited over 90% activity up to 4 cycles [63]. In 2017, Yuan and co-workers fabricated modified Pt/CCF catalysts using freeze drying and carbonization of hydrophilic cotton cellulose fiber, which adsorbed ultrafine Pt ions on the fiber surface under a nitrogen atmosphere. The synthesis of Pt/CCF-500 (pyrolyzed at 500 °C) is shown in Fig. 19 . Among the prepared catalysts with various amounts of Pt, Pt (8%)/CCF-500 had excellent catalytic activity in the hydrolysis of AB, which can be due to the highly dispersed ultrafine Pt NPs adsorbed on the carbon fibers and increased availability of the active sites. The TOF and activation energy of this catalyst were 35 mol H2 mol−1 Pt min−1 and 39.2 kJ/mol, respectively, and it almost kept its initial catalytic activity in the hydrolysis of AB in the fifth run [94]. Fabrication of CFC supported metal NPs (Ag, Cu, and Co NPS) as efficient catalysts for the NaBH4 methanolysis reaction was carried out by Ali and co-workers in 2018. They reported that Ag@CFC had better catalytic activity than other samples with Cu and Co NPs. The effect of chitosan (CH) addition on the NaBH4 methanolysis reaction was also studied. Before the CH addition, Ag@CFC (50 mg) generated 204 mL of H2 in the first 60 min of reaction time. The activation energy of the catalytic reaction was calculated as 20.11 ± 0.12 kJ/mol.K. By adding a few drops of CH solution (10, 50, and 100 mL), the H2 production rate was increased and generated 250 mL of H2 in 18, 11, and 7 min, respectively. Accordingly, CH had a significant impact on accelerating the NaBH4 methanolysis reaction [65]. In 2018, Ding et al. reported a novel template for the in situ preparation of NPs as catalysts for hydrogen production. Solution polymerization was used to prepare a wheat straw cellulose (WSC) based hydrogel template. WSC based hydrogel-nanometal (Ni or Cu) composites were employed for hydrogen production by the hydrolysis of NaBH4. The hydrogel-Ni and Cu composites with the activation energies of 32.66 and 34.83 kJ/mol, respectively, had a maximum hydrogen production rate of 129.96 mL/min.g and 27.84 mL/min.g at 30 °C with 100 mL of 1.0 g/L NaBH4 and 0.10 g of catalyst, respectively. The catalysts can be recycled 100% after 5 runs and the activity of hydrogel-Ni and Cu catalysts reached 77.5% and 70% of the initial value, respectively. The catalytic activity was remained 70% and 65% for hydrogel-Ni and Cu composites, respectively, after storing for 30 days [95]. Ali and co-workers coated chitosan on cellulose fibers (CF), which were treated already with aqueous acetic acid to protonate the fibers to produce hydrogen by NaBH4 methanolysis reaction in 2019 (Fig. 20 ). The reaction generated about 260 mL of hydrogen in the presence of CF-A-CH catalyst in 13 min. The CF-A-CH catalyst had much better catalytic performance compared to CF (250 mL, 34 min) and CF-A (250 mL, 30 min), containing the same amount of the catalyst (50 mg). The activation energy (Ea) of CF-A-CH catalyst was 14.41 ± 0.46 kJ/mol [64]. In 2019, Bekirogullari and co-workers investigated the catalytic effects of CoB catalyst supported on C for the first time. Vulgaris microalgal strain is comprised of cellulose treated with acetic acid, phosphoric acid, and hydrochloric acid (HCl). The CoB catalyst supported C. vulgaris microalgal strain, treated with HCl with a hydrogen production rate of 13,215 mL/min.g cat and activation energy of 25.22 kJ/mol was the best catalyst for NaBH4 methanolysis. The stability of the catalyst was studied after 5 cycles. The volume of the produced hydrogen was almost 100% in the 5th cycle test. It is worth noting that this catalyst has excellent recyclability [96]. Deng et al. fabricated carbon doped graphitic carbon nitride (CGCN) to study the photocatalytic performance in hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation in 2020. They employed cellulose as a carbon source for doping carbon atoms into g-CN and increasing C to N ratio. The UV–Vis light absorption of the obtained catalyst was better than that of the bulk g-CN and its activity was 17 times higher. The amount of hydrogen evolution reached up to 1024 μmol/g.h and the catalyst possessed excellent recyclability after 4 cycles. Replacing N with C atoms can improve the capability of light absorption and enhance the hydrogen evolution [97]. Bahadar Khan has grown metal nanoparticles (Cu, Ag, and Fe NPs) onto cotton cellulose to prepare efficient catalysts for hydrogen production by methanolysis of sodium borohydride in 2020. The methanolysis reactions using CC, Cu@CC, Ag@CC, and Fe@CC catalysts produced 188 mL of H2 in 13 min, 6 min, 11 min, and 12 min, respectively. The catalytic activity of the Cu@CC was superior compared to CC, Ag@CC, Fe@CC, and self-methanolysis of NaBH4. The Cu@CC catalyst showed excellent stability after 3 cycles [98]. Can and co-workers protonated several forms of natural cellulose; namely, microgranular cellulose (MGCell), sigma cell cellulose (SCell), cellulose fibers (FCell), and α-cellulose (AlfaCell) using an amine containing agent (polyethyleneimine, PEI) in 2020. The morphology of pure and modified celluloses can be observed in SEM images in Fig. 21 . Pure celluloses had smooth surfaces and rod like structure. Nevertheless, the modified ones had rough and wrinkled surfaces. The XCell-PEI+ samples were used as catalysts in the methanolysis of NaBH4 for hydrogen generation. The SCell-PEI+ sample was the best catalyst, which generated hydrogen with the rate of 5520 ± 119 mL H2/(g of catalyst × min) and activation energy of 23.4 kJ/mol. The activity of SCell-PEI+ catalyst decreased from 100% to 68 ± 6% after the 5th cycle [99]. Fabrication of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) stabilized nickel‑rhodium nanoparticles was reported for the first time by Tunç and Rakap in 2020. The resultant catalyst showed high catalytic performance in the preparation of pure hydrogen by hydrolysis from H3NBH3 and N2H4BH3. The activation energies of the catalyst in the hydrolysis of H3NBH3 (with TOF value of 200 min−1) and N2H4BH3 (with TOF value of 188 min−1) were measured as 46.8 ± 2 kJ/mol and 60.3 ± 2 kJ/mol, respectively. The catalytic activity in AB and HB reactions was stable after 5 cycles [100]. Cellulose nanocrystals were utilized to form CNC/TiO2 hybrid films with chiral nematic structure by Wang and co-workers in 2020. CNC was then removed by the calcination process to form a lamellar structure (L-TiO2 film), which can improve the lifetime of charge carriers and photocatalytic properties of the sample compared to standard TiO2. The rate of hydrogen production by L-TiO2–1 was 287.2 μmol/h.g, which is about two times that of the standard TiO2 (153.1 μmol/h.g). Furthermore, to increase the photocatalytic performance of L-TiO2–1, different metal oxides; namely, Cu, Ni, Bi, and V oxides, were coupled to TiO2 by the same method. Among these, L-TiO2/Cu displayed the best photocatalytic activity with 7.88 mmol/h.g H2 production, which is tremendously higher than the corresponding value for L-TiO2–1 [101]. Peng and co-workers prepared a catalyst with a great activity for hydrolysis of NaBH4 in 2021 [102]. To prepare the catalyst, bacterial cellulose (BC)-derived carbon was synthesized via one-step chemical reduction and used as a substrate for CoB alloy. BC/Co-B nanocomposite with a high surface area of 125.31 m2/g and great stability showed high catalytic activity, a good hydrogen generation rate of 3887.1 mL/min g at 30 °C, and the activation energy of 56.37 kJ/mol. Compared with the other carbon supports such as activated carbon and GO, BC produced more hydrogen due to its structural properties. Therefore, BC/Co-B nanocomposite is a good catalyst for hydrogen production by hydrolysis of NaBH4."
6,Chitin- and chitosan-based catalysts,"5.2 Chitin- and chitosan-based catalysts Chitin and chitosan heteropolymers are known as environmentally available biopolymers after cellulose [103]. The chemical structure of chitin (C8H13O5N)n includes linear homopolymers of β-(1,4) linked N-acetylglucosamine (N-acetyl-2-amino-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranose) units [27]. However, the crustaceans shell is the main resource for chitin extraction. The skeleton of insects, arthropods, and mollusks are also utilized for chitin production (Fig. 22 ) [28,104]. Chitin with a high molecular weight is an affordable and stable starting material for the production of polymeric matrices. In addition, chitin is a hydrophobic, water insoluble polymer and has excellent biological properties such as non-toxicity, antibacterial effect, and biocompatibility [27]. In contrast, chitosan, a derivative of chitin prepared by alkaline deacetylation process, is a hetero-polysaccharide composed of 2-amino-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranose and 2-acetamido-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranose (chitin) residue [104]. Fig. 22 demonstrates the chitin and chitosan structures. Although chitosan has interesting properties as an organic polymer such as solubility in dilute acids (acetic acid, formic acid, etc.) and high absorption due to its active functional groups (-OH and -NH2 groups), it shows poor stability, weak mechanical strength and thermal resistance and low surface area [103–105]. Recently, composites based on raw chitin and chitosan have been prepared to improve the properties and widen their application. There are several reports based on employing chitin and chitosan composition in the biomedical field [106], hydrogen production [107–109] and treatment of wastewater [110,111]. As carbon sources, chitin and chitosan can be used for hydrogen production by evolution reaction [15–17,39,112,113], photocatalytic process [114,115] and NaBH4 methanolysis reaction [64,116,117]. 5.2.1 Chitin- and chitosan-based catalysts for electrochemical hydrogen evolution Initially, in 2007, Ganesan and Gedanken synthesized tungsten trioxide (WO3) nanoparticles using chitosan as a template. The WO3-chitosan gel was calcined in the temperature range of 400–600 °C and used for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution in an acidic medium. The sample calcined at 500 °C (WOchi500) showed the best HER activity. The current density of WOchi500 at −0.8 V was 45 mA/cm2, which was 4.5 times higher than that of WObulk (10 mA cm−2) catalyst prepared without chitosan [118]. Wang et al. reported the fabrication of honeycomb like Mo2C@nitrogen doped carbon nanosheet/graphene (Mo2C@N-DC/G) aerogel films using chitin biopolymer in 2020. The synthesis process (Fig. 23 ) was based on an in situ solid reaction in which chitin was carbonized, graphene oxide was thermally reduced and hexaammonium molybdate was reduced by carbothermal method (inside interspace of the N-DC/G aerogel) simultaneously. 3D porous network microstructure and synergistic effect of the Mo2C NPs and the 3D N-DC/G conductive substrates in the Mo2C@N-DC/G films provided great electron transfer and active sites and excellent catalytic activity. The Mo2C@N-DC/G aerogel films were tested as electrocatalysts for HER in an acidic medium (0.5 M H2SO4 solution) and the optimized sample (Mo2C@N-DC/G-5) exhibited outstanding HER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 107 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope of 65.8 mV/dec. Moreover, it displayed electrochemical stability with no considerable decay after 1500 cycles and 15 h [119]. Synthesis of polyaniline-chitosan/Pt (PAni-Chi/Pt) composite film on an inexpensive pencil graphite electrode was reported by Kayan and co-workers in 2016 for the first time. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 24 . The synergetic effect of combining Pt NPs with the PAni-Chi composite film, which has high conductivity and porous structure, led to the formation of an excellent catalyst for hydrogen evolution. The overpotential value of PAni-Chi/Pt electrocatalyst to obtain a current density of 10 mA/cm2 was 0.45 V and Tafel slope value was 121 mV/dec. Moreover, the electrocatalyst showed long term electrochemical stability and high activity after 1000 cycles [115]. In 2019, Wang et al. used chitosan and urea as the carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively, to prepare cobalt supported on N-doped porous carbon (Co@NPC) electrocatalyst for HER. The prepared sample showed excellent activity with a low overpotential of 259 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope of 99 mV/dec in 1 M KOH solution. Additionally, after the 6 h electrochemical test, 83% of its original current density remained, which indicates the high stability of the electrocatalyst [120]. Nasri et al. synthesized a novel g-C3N4/chitosan/Au (CN/CS/Au) nanocomposite via a facile and cost effective method in 2020. The synthesis process is shown in Fig. 25 . Chitosan enhanced the adhesion of the material, its stability on the surface of the electrode and catalytic activity of the composite for electrochemical HER. To improve the HER activity of the electrodes, their surface was activated. The optimized electrocatalyst with a small content of Au NPs synthesized by laser ablation method had superior HER performance with low overpotential and Tafel slope of 136 mV/dec in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The electroactive surface area was calculated to be 1.313 cm2, indicating a large contact area between the electrode and electrolyte interface. This electrocatalyst can store 35C/g hydrogens at a current density of 5 A/g with excellent stability after 300 cycles. Moreover, the stability of the electrode tested after 10 days showed that the electrode had good stability with only a negligible current density loss (4.75 A/g) [39]. The preparation of N-doped carbon matrices using chitosan and formaldehyde by sol-gel process and decoration of Ni2P and MoP on it were reported by Xu and co-workers in 2020. The HER activity of Ni2P/MoP-CC catalyst was studied in different pHs. According to the results, Ni2P/MoP-CC catalyst had low onset potentials of 300, 200, and 5 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1.0 M PBS, and 1.0 M KOH solutions, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 with corresponding Tafel slopes of 63, 99, and 64 mV/dec. Superior stability (98.5% after the 10000th cycle) was observed for this catalyst [121]. The HER performance of other chitin and chitosan-based (nano)catalysts is summarized in Table 2 . 5.2.2 Chitin and chitosan-based catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution Jian and co-workers improved the stability and photocatalytic performance of typical mimic of the diiron subsite of [FeFe]‑hydrogenase ([Fe2(CO)6(μ-at)CH2C6H5]), interacted with the 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA)-capped CdTe quantum dots (MPA-CdTe QDs) using chitosan in 2013. The substantial amount of protonated amines and the hydroxyl group of chitosan led to interaction with the negative surface of MPA-CdTe QDs, [Fe2(CO)6(μ-at)CH2C6H5] catalyst and H2A, continuous electron transition and improved hydrogen evolution rate (Fig. 26 ). The optimized photocatalyst with 1.0 g/L chitosan generated 1.27 ± 0.01 mL (TON = 569 ± 2) through 10 h irradiation (410 nm) at ambient temperature [125]. In 2017, Oliveira et al. proposed an ecologically sound and lucrative treatment for the photogeneration of hydrogen by fabricating chitosan/TiO2 (QTS/TiO2) hybrid photocatalysts with several fabrication variables. They utilized the catalysts in the photocatalytic reaction of ethanol with visible light at room temperature. The 40% QTS/TiO2 calcined at 773 K (40QTS/TiO2773) produced the highest amount of hydrogen (1604.49 μmolH2/g TiO2) after 4.5 h reaction time [126]. Wang and co-workers fabricated WO3-x@NC by pyrolysis of chitosan and polyoxometalates (POMs) in 2018 (Fig. 27 ). The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of WO3-x@NC was studied by IR irradiation (λ = 808 nm) and the highest rate was 40.2 μmol/h·g. This value did not considerably change after five runs [127]. In 2020, Zhang and Zhang reported the synthesis of a photocatalyst (NiL-CN) using chitosan as the support to anchor nickel, according to Fig. 28 . The optimized NiL3-CN sample exhibited the best photocatalytic behavior with 346 μmol/g.h H2 evolution under visible light (λ > 420 nm) irradiation. The photocatalyst showed outstanding activity with an insignificant decline in hydrogen production after the 4th test [128]. 5.2.3 Chitin and chitosan-based catalysts in the hydrolysis of hydrides In 2014, Wang et al. fabricated natural tubular Kapok fiber/chitosan/Au NPs (KF/CTS/AuNPs) and carboxylated KF/chitosan/Au NPs (CKF/CTS/AuNPs) using a green, facile, and non-covalent process. In this synthesis, chitosan acted as a bridge and led to the easy adsorption of Au NPs on CTS-coated KF or CKF matrices. The prepared catalysts were utilized for hydrogen production from NaBH4 by adding Congo Red (CR) dye molecules as an electron acceptor (Fig. 29 ). The presence of dye molecules led to the rapid transformation of NaBH4 to hydrogen gas and discoloration of dye molecules simultaneously. Accordingly, the catalysts can generate hydrogen energy by consuming CR dye wastewater and the maximum produced hydrogen reached 430 mL/L CR solution (20 mg/L) using the CKF/CTS/AuNPs catalyst [129]. Synthesis of Co3O4 micro cubed catalyst through hydrothermal treatment using chitosan/urea was reported by Tomboc and co-workers in 2017. Different mass ratios of Co(NO3)2.6H2O/urea were fabricated and the sample with 1:10 mass ratio had the highest catalytic activity and the best microcubed structure. The micro cube shaped catalyst provided a higher surface area and acceptable catalytic activity compared with the sphere and tube like shaped catalysts. A 1:10 mixture of Co(NO3)2.6H2O/urea with and chitosan was calcined at different temperatures and the one calcined at 700 °C was the best catalyst. A great hydrogen production rate of 1497.55 mLH2/min was obtained from the hydrolysis of NaBH4 solution (2 wt%) with using 0.02 g of the catalyst at 25 °C. The activation energy was 47.97 KJ/mol. The catalyst was tested for five repeated cycles and no remarkable changes were observed in its catalytic performance after recycling [117]. Jia and co-workers fabricated magnetic graphene oxide-ionic liquid grafted chitosan (GO-ILCS-Fe3O4) composites by one pot synthesis combined with co-precipitation method in 2018. The prepared composite was used to support the in situ reduced Pd(0) NPs and prepare Pd(0)/GO-ILCS-Fe3O4 catalyst for hydrogen generation from hydrolysis of AB. GO-ILCS sheets do not restack in the presence of Fe3O4 NPs and led to an increase in the surface area and excellent distribution of Pd(0) NPs, and thus increased the catalytic activity. The TOF value was 30.2 molH2/molPd.min at 30 °C and the calculated reaction activation energy was 32.6 kJ/mol. This catalyst had superior reusability for AB hydrolysis with no clear decline in activity after ten runs [130]. In 2018, the application of chitosan as a support for anchoring the in situ reduced ultrafine palladium nanoparticles was reported by Chen et al. Fig. 30 shows the promising distribution of Pd NPs without evident agglomeration before and after testing. The obtained Pd NPs/CS catalysts showed exceptional catalytic activity in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of AB in an aqueous medium. The maximum TOF value was 24.76 molH2/molPd.min at 30 °C with the activation energy of 36.25 kJ/mol and the concentrations of 0.81 and 0.45 for Pd and AB, respectively. Concerning the results, hydrogen production keeps a constant value with no considerable decrease in catalytic activity after 11 runs. Hence, the catalyst has adequate recyclability [131]. The other catalysts have been listed in Table 3 ."
7,Alginate-based (nano)catalysts,"5.3 Alginate-based (nano)catalysts Alginate, a natural polysaccharide, consists of β-(1 → 4) linked D-mannuronic acid (M) and α-(1 → 4)-linked L-guluronic acid (G) residues (Fig. 31 ) [30]. Alginate is an anionic polymer found in brown seaweed cell walls as the calcium, magnesium, and sodium salts and can be obtained from bacterial sources [135,136]. Therefore, it is known as alginate acid and salt and is commercially available as sodium, potassium, or ammonium salts in the color range of white to yellowish-brown [135]. The gel form of alginate can be obtained by ionic cross-linking with cations (ionic gels) or acid precipitation (acidic gels) methods [30]. Moreover, alginates form different G and M ratios depending on the source, which determines their biological, physical, and chemical properties (Fig. 31) [137]. One of the important chemical characterizations of alginates is the presence of hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups, which cause their hydrophilicity and possibility of chemical modification [138]. Likewise, oxidation reaction, chemical modification, sulfation, phosphorylation reaction, graft copolymerization, carbodiimide coupling, esterification, and covalent cross-linking methods were employed for alginate modification to improve its properties [139]. According to the reports, alginate combinations have several applications, mainly in biomedical and delivery systems [140–144]. Alginate can be used for dye removal from water due to its absorption ability [145,146]. However, there has been much research on hydrogen production using alginate due to its free hydroxyl and carboxyl groups, which give rise to good interaction with H2O [14]. Hydrogen evolution reaction and the photocatalytic process can be used as hydrogen production methods by alginate-based compositions [147,148]. 5.3.1 Alginate-based (nano)catalysts for electrochemical hydrogen evolution In 2014, Cui et al. reported a convenient technique to achieve graphitic carbon sheets (GCSs) from hydrolysis of sodium alginate powder and decoration of molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) nanoparticles on the GCSs. The Mo2C/GCSs nanocomposite showed high HER performance in 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions with an onset potential of 120 mV (200 mV at 10 mA/cm2) and a Tafel slope of 62.6 mV/dec. The electrocatalyst was stable after 3000 cycles [149]. Similarly, Lin and co-workers used sodium alginate as a carbon source and ammonium hypophosphite as nitrogen and phosphorus source to synthesize N, P co-doped carbon flakes (NPCFs) and CoP/NPCFs hybrid catalyst in 2017 (Fig. 32 ). The synergistic effect of NPCFs and CoP led to high HER activity. The overpotential was 135 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and the Tafel slope had a small value of 67 mV/dec [150]. Plavsic and Strmecki evaluated the H2 evolution of polysaccharides (PS) using electrochemical measurement. Na-alginate and some other PS were chosen as PS substrates for the complexing of copper ions for this purpose. Na-alginate showed H2 evolution peak and can thus be used as a catalyst for H2 production due to its carboxyl groups and the lower surface active substrate [151]. In 2020, Lai et al. developed a novel method employing ice-templating of sodium alginate and nickel to synthesize 2D ultrathin nickel phosphide nanosheets, as shown in Fig. 33 . The Ni5P4–500-350 electrocatalyst showed a low overpotential of 147 mV at 10 mA/cm2, a low Tafel slope of 57 mV/dec, and great stability after 1000 cycles in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte [148]. 5.3.2 Alginate-based (nano)catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution López-Vásquez and co-workers synthesized microspheres of black sand by calcination of sodium alginate under an oxidizing atmosphere at 1100 °C in 2020. The sample was used as a photocatalyst for H2 evolution in EDTA solution under UV light. 5 h through the irradiation, the maximum amount of H2 production was 685.6 μmol for 1 g/L of photocatalyst and 10 mM EDTA solution at 25 °C [152]. In 2020, Ramprakash and Incharoensakdia fabricated an encapsulated hybrid system using sodium alginate combined with TiO2 NPs and studied its photocatalytic hydrogen production performance under aerobic/anaerobic conditions. They reported that the hydrogen generation of the encapsulated system was three times higher than of the unencapsulated system under aerobic conditions and the system could be useful for hydrogen production under direct sunlight. The encapsulated hybrid system can produce 2.4 mmol H2/mmol glucose in 48 h under a visible light intensity of 2000 W/m2 [153]. 5.3.3 Alginate-based catalysts in hydrolysis of hydrides for hydrogen generation The embedding of cobalt‑boron (CoB) catalyst in alginate beads and combining with NaBH4 in DMF solution with PEG to prepare the NaBH4-CoB/alginate bead composites was reported by Chen and Kim in 2010. The catalyst was incorporated in the cross-linked alginate bead. Therefore, the composite can be generated again via fueling NaBH4. The catalytic performance of NaBH4-CoB/alginate bead for hydrogen production was investigated when the composite was added into the water without NaOH under ambient conditions. The composite combined 0.01 g of CoB/alginate bead with 0.2 g of NaBH4 and 0.2 g of PEG to produce 538.7520 mL/min.g hydrogen [154]. In 2014, Ai and co-workers reported cobalt synthesis in situ on macroscopic alginate hydrogels (Co@AHs), as shown in Fig. 34 , for hydrogen production by the hydrolysis of NaHB4. The H2 production rate was in the range of 0.888–2.03 mL/min for 10–30 beads at 30 °C. The Ea for Co@AHs catalyst was calculated to be 55.6 kJ/mol. The catalyst was readily separated from the reaction mixture and recycled over four repeated cycles [155]. In 2017, Pandey et al. fabricated nanocomposites based on Pd NPs using 2-(3,4 epoxycyclohexyl)ethyltrimethoxysilane (EETMS) and 2-(3,4 epoxycyclohexyl)ethyltrimethoxysilane (EETMS). The synthesized Pd/EETMS, Pd/GPTMS, Pd/GO/EETMS and Pd/GO/GPTMS were encapsulated into silica-alginate with a pore size of 2-10 nm and used as catalysts for H2 production. The H2 generation ability of the catalysts was tested using hydrazine decomposition, which was monitored by FTIR spectroscopy. In addition, the produced soluble H2 was measured by CV analysis and the maximum current density for Pd/GO/EETMS sample (20-25 mA/cm) was obtained as 280 mV. The catalytic H2 evolution was studied by reduction of p-nitroaniline (PNA), which was followed using UV-Vis spectroscopy. One of the fabricated nanocomposites, silica-alginate beads with Pd/GO/EETMS, exhibited great catalytic activity in hydrazine decomposition; especially when treated at high temperatures. Cost effective silica-alginate beads can maintain the catalytic potential of nanocomposites for repeated decomposition reactions. Accordingly, Pd/GO/EETMS was used for 4-5 cycles and thus the catalytic activity reached 80% [156]. Kinsiz et al. applied the nano-casting method to prepare cobalt oxide (Co3O4) microbeads by calcium-alginate capsules (in micron size, 140 μm). The resultant catalyst was used in the hydrolysis of NH3BH3 for hydrogen generation at 60 °C and released 2844 mol H2/mol Co3O4. min. The catalytic activity of the catalyst was tested after 15 cycles and it was observed that the amount of generated H2 was unchanged after each cycle [157]."
8,Starch-based (nano)catalysts,"5.4 Starch-based (nano)catalysts Starch, which is a semi-crystalline biomass, consists of two polysaccharides; namely, amylose, and amylopectin, which include chains of α-(1,4)-linked d-glucose residues and α-(1,6)-glucosidic linkages, respectively [158,159]. The amounts of amylose and amylopectin and their properties affect starch properties [160]. Extracted starch possesses 20–25% amylose and 75–80% amylopectin and nearly 70% of starch is amorphous [161]. Moreover, there are minor ingredients in the starch structure such as lipids, proteins, ashes, and phosphates, which significantly affect starch properties [160]. The presence of lipids causes a reduction of swelling, water binding capacity, and stability [159]. Phosphide and protein in starch lead to the stability and transparency of starch solution, respectively [159]. Starch with a molecular weight in the range of 107–109 Da is a naturally available material for food, paper, textile, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and biomedical industries due to its properties, as presented in Fig. 35 [162,163]. Recently, enzymatic, physical and chemical modification techniques have been used to improve starch properties [162]. Fig. 35 illustrates other information on starch including chemical structure, source, properties, and modification methods [164]. 5.4.1 Starch-based (nano)catalysts for electrochemical hydrogen evolution Starch, a cost efficient carbon source, was utilized in a simple one pot method to fabricate Mo2C/N-PC catalyst by Han et al. in 2019. In this fabrication method, ultra-small Mo2C nanodots were set in the in situ synthesized N-doped porous carbon layers. The synergetic effect of nitrogen doping and abundant defects had a valuable role in increasing the catalytic activity. Mo2C/N-PC reached small overpotentials of 178, 224, and 100 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1.0 M PBS, and 1.0 M KOH solutions, respectively. The corresponding Tafel slope values were 72.3, 140.8, and 94.5 mV/dec, respectively. Thus, Mo2C/N-PC catalyst performed better under alkaline conditions (1.0 M KOH). The long term stability of the Mo2C/N-PC after 16 h without significant decline was reported in alkaline electrolyte [165]. In another work in 2020, Liu et al. [166] fabricated an efficient catalyst containing subminiature Rh2P nanoparticles and N, P-doped porous carbon (NPC) for electrochemical hydrogen evolution in the entire pH range. Starch assisted confinement-assembly-pyrolysis (SCAP) strategy was utilized for nanoparticle preparation. Rh2P/NPC catalyst with high activity and stability showed low overpotential at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 at 40 mV and 17 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH solutions, respectively. In natural seawater, the synthesized catalyst had better activity than Pt/C catalyst; reaching 300 mA/cm2 current density at 411 mV. Hence, this novel catalyst can produce hydrogen from seawater by electrolysis. 5.4.2 Starch-based (nano) catalysts in the hydrolysis of hydrides In 2009, Yan and co-workers synthesized Ni nanoparticles in the presence and absence of starch. The as-prepared samples were used for hydrogen production from AB. High catalytic performance has been seen was observed in both catalysts. The amounts of produced H2 relative to the specific surface area (m2) for samples with and without starch were 4.4 10–2 and 4.8 10–2 mol/m2, respectively. Starch played the role of supporting Ni particles and keeping the catalytic activity after 240 h. Nevertheless, the performance of the sample without starch decreased. Furthermore, in the presence of starch, the size of Ni NPs was smaller with the lower aggregation of particles [167]. Since ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) is a non-toxic source with a high hydrogen value (19.6 wt%), Du et al. [168] used it for hydrogen generation using nanoporous Ni, NiFe, and NiPt catalysts Firstly, Ni and NiFe NPs with sizes of 20–25 nm were formed in the starch solution and then NiPt catalyst was prepared from the isolated Ni nanoparticles. Although both Ni and NiFe displayed significant catalytic activity and reusability, the H2 generation by NiFe catalyst was higher compared with Ni due to the improved composition of the former. Finally, the catalytic activity investigation of Ni1-x-Ptx (x = 0.01, 0.08, and 0.19) demonstrated a faster hydrolysis reaction and higher H2 generation rate. In brief, Ni0.81Pt0.19 was identified as a premiere catalyst owing to the releasing H2 rate of 5251 mL/min.g only after 4 min reaction. Ni0.99Pt0.01 with a low amount of Pt led to significant H2 generation and low activity energy (49.3 and 51.5 kJ/mol). Accordingly, Ni-based nanostructure can be utilized for the generation and storage of H2 due to the hydrolysis of AB. In another report, Sang et al. synthesized CoCu and NiCu alloys from other starch resources using simple methods at room temperature (Fig. 36a). The as-synthesized samples were used to generate H2 from the hydrolysis of AB. The SEM images of Co, Cu, Ni, Co0.52Cu0.48, and Ni0.19Cu0.81 catalysts showed that the samples prepared without starch polymer (using only deionized water) have larger and irregular particles, as shown in Fig. 36b. The morphology of Co0.52Cu0.48 and Ni0.19Cu0.81 alloys was changed to a uniform structure with small size particles (Fig. 36c). However, the investigation of the catalytic activity for H2 generation confirmed that metal NPs had lower activity than bimetallic NPs. The bimetallic NPs synthesized by starch solution exhibited a higher releasing rate of H2. Of the two prefabricated alloys by starch, Co0.52Cu0.48 with H2 rate of 2179 mL/min.g−1 and activation energy of 37.3 kJ/mol displayed higher catalytic activity [169]. In 2019, Chairam and co-workers synthesized starch hydrogel by cross-linking method and then loaded cobalt NPs (Co NPs) within starch hydrogel network The H2 generation ability of the as-prepared sample was tested by studying the H2 release rate from NaBH4 hydrolysis. The starch hydrogel did not exhibit any activity for H2 release while the starch hydrogel loaded Co NPs demonstrated good catalytic activity with H2 generation and activation energy of 453 mL and 52.18 kJ/mol, respectively, only after 30 min. The catalytic activity of starch hydrogel loaded Co NPs did not change after five consecutive cycles. Hence, the starch hydrogel network can be used for loading metal NPs in the hydrolysis of hydrides for H2 production [170]. Ozay et al. loaded Ru(0) NPs within hydroxyethyl starch (HES-p(AMPS) IPN) hydrogel network (Ru@HES-p(AMPS) IPN) and the catalytic activity of the produced sample in H2 production was measured in the hydrolysis of ethylenediamine bisborane (EDAB HES-p(AMPS) IPN hydrogel morphology was investigated using SEM analysis, which presented a homogeneous porous structure with a diameter of 30 μm (Fig. 37a), confirming the network structure for HES-p(AMPS) IPN hydrogel. The application of HES-p(AMPS) IPN hydrogel as a catalyst for H2 production from EDAB hydrolysis was studied for 120 min and no H2 generation occurred. On the other hand, almost 120 mL of H2 were released by the addition of Ru@HES-p(AMPS) IPN catalyst to EDAB solution. The effect of the amount of Ru@HES-p(AMPS) IPN catalyst on hydrolysis reaction was investigated and it was observed that increasing the amount of the catalyst quickly completed the reaction. In addition, H2 production by the hydrolysis of different concentrations of EDAB solution was studied. Upon increasing the EDAB concentration, the volume of the produced H2 was increased. As reported, increasing temperature has a positive effect on the H2 generation rate. Finally, the activation energy of Ru@HES-p(AMPS) IPN catalyst was obtained as about 38.92 kJ/mol [171]. Since using a single atom catalyst is an important issue in the renewable energy system, Wang and co-workers synthesized colloidal Co as a single atom catalyst for H2 production from hydrolysis of an alkaline solution of KBH4. To measure the catalytic activity, the as-prepared Co NPs with an average size of 1.2 nm were stabilized by copolymers such as starch, poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (PVP), carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMCNa), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), sodium polyacrylate (PAAS), and polyethylene glycol (PEG) and poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride) (ISOBAM-104). The combination of ISOBAM-104 and Co showed higher catalytic activity in H2 production (14,300 mL-H2/min.g-Co), reaching 3200 mL-H2/min.g-Co after four cycles. In addition, the H2 generation rate of ISOBAM-104 stabilized Co NPs was compared with ISOBAM-104 stabilized Pt, Pd, and Rh metal NPs and the results showed that stabilized Co NPs had better catalytic activity for H2 release. The effects of the molar ratio of ISOBAM-104 to Co2+ (RISO) and concentration of Co2+ (Cobalt) were investigated and excellent catalytic activity was obtained using RISO = 40 and Ccobalt = 0.9 mM [172]. In 2021, Chairam and co-workers [173] used starch hydrogel, papered by citric acid cross-linking method, to synthesize starch hydrogel-CoNi bimetallic alloys as the catalyst for hydrogen production from hydrolysis of NaBH4. The best catalytic reaction was achieved using 3:2 initial molar ratio of cobalt to nickel and the hydrogen release was also enhanced by increasing the catalyst content and NaBH4. In addition, the effect of different temperatures on the hydrolysis reaction was examined and the result showed that the produced hydrogen gas was approximately 250 (± 3) mL in all temperatures. The obtained activation parameters (activation energy, enthalpy, and entropy of 36.24 kJ/mol, 37.75 kJ/mol and − 125.23 kJ/mol K, respectively) showed that the synthesized catalyst was a great and novel catalyst for catalytic applications."
9,Gelatin-based (nano)catalysts,"5.5 Gelatin-based (nano)catalysts Gelatin, a water soluble functional protein, consists of 18 amino acids with repeating Gly-Pro-x or Gly-x-Hyp units in which x is an alkaline or an acidic amino acid (Fig. 38 ) [174]. Furthermore, gelatin is composed of three chains including α, β, and γ-chains [175]. It has high molecular weight polypeptide derivatives from collagen, a fibrous insoluble protein, and it can be obtained from bones, skin, and tissue of animals, as shown in Fig. 38 [175]. Various factors such as gelatin source, extraction method, and type of collagen affect the physicochemical properties of gelatin [175]. It is a solid material without taste and odor with a glassy like shape and light yellow color [174]. Gelatin is soluble in aqueous solutions of polyhydric alcohols and highly polar organic solvents. The important physical properties of gelatin are gel strength and viscosity. Gelatin has water absorption ability and is a polyampholyte due to the presence of positive and negative charges as well as uncharged hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups [174]. Gelatin has many biological properties such as non-toxicity, high purity, non-allergic nature and biocompatibility [176]. Gelatin biopolymer is widely used as a stabilizer in the food industry; especially in the confectionery industry. Furthermore, it can be used for hard and soft capsules, plasma expanders, ointments, wound dressing and biomedical applications [175]. Consumption of gelatin in cosmetic and photographic industries is another application of this natural polymer [176]. 5.5.1 Gelatin-based (nano)catalysts for electrochemical hydrogen evolution In 2015, Chekin et al. reported the H2 production ability of synthesized Pd-doped TiO2 from gelation solution. Proton or hydrogen atom (H+) adsorption/desorption of coated Pd-doped TiO2 on the glassy carbon electrode (Pd-TiO2/GCE) was shown by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis in 0.1 M H2SO4 electrolyte at 50 mV/s. According to the CV curve attributed to Pd, one peak appeared in the potential range of 0 to −0.1 V. The electrocatalytic activity of Pd-TiO2/GCE measured using linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) showed enhancement in the surface of Pd-TiO2/GCE as a thorough beginning potential at −0.4 V vs. Ag|AgCl|KCl3M [177]. Zang and co-workers used gelatin hydrogel as a scaffolding agent to fit metal ions (Mo5+, W6+, Co2+) in the prepared transition metal carbide (TMC) sheets with thickness of 10 nm, followed by carbonization of ion-gel systems at 600 oC to form Mo2C, W2C, Co3C, W/Mo2C-Co and Mo2-xWxC. In addition, Co NPs were used for decoration of Mo2C structure, which caused excellent HER efficiency. Tafel curve in 0.5 M H2So4 was applied for catalytic activity measurement of the loaded sample on carbon paper. An optimized mass of Mo2C (1 mg/cm) had a Tafel slope of 68 mV/dec while Co NPs addition caused a low Tafel slope at 39 mV/dec and overpotential at 48 mV [178]. 5.5.2 Gelatin-based (nano)catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution Yan et al. reported facile gelatin assisted hydrothermal reaction of Zn(OAc)2 and thiourea to prepare ZnS hollow nanospheres. The synthesis temperature, the mass ratio of gelatin/Zn, and reaction time were investigated as the effective parameters on the size and shape of ZnS. Gelatin had a substantial effect on the ZnS size reduction. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of ZnS hollow nanospheres was tested using a 300 W Xe lamp as a UV light source. Photoluminescence (PL) emission of ZnS samples was studied because lower PL emission indicated lower recombination of electron-hole pairs and resulted in greater photocatalytic HER activity. Among all the samples, ZnS-4-24-120 with the lowest PL displayed higher photocatalytic activity for H2 production. ZnS-4-24-120 similarly showed great stability during 4 photocatalytic reactions [179]. TiO2 is an efficient metal oxide for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution due to its great surface area and porous structure. Therefore, Liu and co-workers prepared mesoporous TiO2 with a high surface area (98.3 m2/g) and small pore size (11.9 nm) using the sol-gel method with gelatin templet (uisng 1%, 2% and 5% gelatin additive). The results showed that increasing gelatin could increase H2 production due to the improvement of TiO2 structure. Accordingly, H2 generation was achieved by the addition of 5% gelatin to 6 mol% up to 90 bars, which was higher than the other samples [180]."
10,Collagen-based (nano)catalysts,"5.6 Collagen-based (nano)catalysts Collagen is the main extracellular matrix protein in animals in the fibrous tissue. This biodegradable polymer is composed of three polypeptide chains in a triple helix in which the repeating Gly-X-Y (Glycineproline-Hydroproline) amino acid sequences are stabilized by hydrogen bonds [175]. Currently, 29 types of collagen have been known, type I being one of the abundant types of collagen. Collagen types I, II, III, and V are referred to as fibril collagens [181,182]. Since collagen can be extracted from different skin and bones of animals sources depicted in Fig. 39 , its properties and applications depend on the extraction sources [183,184]. Collagen modification can be performed to increase its performance. Cross-linking is one of the techniques for collagen modification. In addition, combinations of collagen with some materials such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) [185], polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) [186], chitosan [187] etc. are employed to improve its properties. Collagen is a 3-dimantional porous compound, which can be used for hydrogen production [188]. 5.6.1 Collagen-based (nano)catalysts for electrochemical hydrogen evolution In 2018, Luo et al. used a ruthenium doped collagen based carbon scaffold (Ru-CCS) as an efficient HER catalyst. For this purpose, a biomimetic bottom-up technique was applied for Ru-CCS synthesis and then the catalytic activity of the samples was tested using linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) in a cell with three electrodes. Approximately 0.285 mg/cm of Ru-CCS and three control samples including Pt/C, Ru, and CCS were loaded on the glassy carbon electrodes. The results showed that Ru-CCS had the highest HER activity with a low overpotential of 11.0 mV. Moreover, the HER catalytic activity of Ru-CCS can be controlled by regulating the annealing temperature. Annealing at 800 °C was evaluated the most suitable because the integration of Ru and CCS increases at 800 °C. The Tafel slope of Ru-CCS was 33 mV/dec. Ru-CCS stability was investigated during 3000 cycles in 0.5 M H2SO4 and the results showed a slight increase in the overpotential (15.5 mV) at a current density of 10 mA/cm2. Therefore, Ru-CCS can be used as an efficient HER catalyst [189]. 5.6.2 Collagen-based (nano)catalysts in the hydrolysis of hydrides Jia and co-workers studied the catalytic activity of Pd/collagen powder graphene oxide hybrids (CGP-GO-Fe3O4) for H2 generation by the hydrolysis of AB hybrid. Firstly, the CGP-GOO-Fe3O4 hybrid was fabricated through a simple co-precipitation route and then Pd NPs were accumulated on the hybrid. Different concentrations of the catalyst and AB were studied in the catalytic activity evaluation. The H2 release rate was improved by the catalyst concentration increase and TOF values were 14.8, 16.7, 17.0, 14.9, and 16.2 molH2. mol−1 Pd.min−1. The H2 generation was increased when the AB concentration was increased, resulting in the AB concentration of 87.5 mM caused by the TOF value of 27.4 molH2/molPd.min. Finally, the reaction temperature effect was investigated at 293–323 K and TOF values were 9.8, 16.3, 23.7, and 44.4 molH2/molPd.min at 293, 303, 313, and 323 K, respectively. The prepared hybrid with a calculated activation energy of 36.5 kJ/mol had good recyclability [190]. In 2021, Fu and Cai used collagen fiber (CF) as a stabilizer and carrier of Ru (NPs) to fabricate the CF-BT-Ru catalyst using bayberry tannin (BT). Hydrolysis of AB was performed in the presence of CF-BT-Ru catalyst to study the hydrogen production rate of the catalyst. CF-BT-Ru catalyst had a superior catalytic activity with the activation energy and hydrogen generation of 32.41 kJ/mol and 322 molH2/molRu.min, respectively. The stability of this catalyst was acceptable and it could be reused minimum of five runs without considerable decline in hydrogen generation [191]."
11,Gum-based (nano)catalysts,"5.7 Gum-based (nano)catalysts Gums are a prominent natural polysaccharides, which consists of sugar and have been known as widely used industrial materials due to their biocompatibility, odorlessness, non-toxicity, water solubility, biodegradability, cost-effectiveness, and availability. Guar gum is a high molecular weight (220–250 kDa) and linear hydrophilic polysaccharide with white to yellowish color including guaran, cluster bean, and Calcutta lucerne, Gum Cyamopsis, Cyamopsis gum, Guarina, Glucocard, and Guyarem. In addition, it is composed of chains of β-(1–4)-D-mannan as well α-(1–6) linked galactose (Fig. 40 ) and is a water soluble, stable, high viscosity, highly biocompatible, and biodegradable polymer. The endosperm of Cyamopsis tetragonolobus or Cyamopsis psoralioides are two resources for guar gum extraction. Guar gum and its derivatives are practical for industrial applications such as cosmetics, food, and drug industries. Moreover, hydroxyl groups present in guar gum structure make its derivatives applicable for hydrogen production [35,192,193]. 5.7.1 Gum-based (nano) catalysts for electrochemical hydrogen evolution Cheng et al. reported the synthesis of B, N co-doping carbon nanosheets (Bx/GCA) by cross-linking of guar gum. The HER catalytic activity of Bx/GCA was tested using an electrochemical cell with three electrodes and three different electrolytes including 0.5 M H2SO4, 1.0 M KOH, and 1.0 M PBS. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) were carried out for the catalytic activity evaluation. In 0.5 M H2SO4 medium, B5/GCA exhibited high catalytic activity with a low overpotential of ~51.96 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 as well as the Tafel slopes of ~120 mV/dec, 40 mV/dec, and ~ 30 mV/dec, determined by Volmer, Heyrovsky, or Tafel reaction, respectively. This was due to its high surface area and active sites. Although the overpotential of B5/GCA in alkaline (~52.34 mV) medium was close to the corresponding value in acidic (~51.96 Mv) medium, the Tafel slope in the alkaline solution was nearly 43 mV dec−1, which was lower than that in the acidic medium. It had lower catalytic activity in PBS electrolyte due to the low H+ value in the natural solution [194]. In 2020, Hui et al. synthesized N-doped carbon nanosheets consisting of ultrafine Mo2C from guar gum by a simple technique. The presence of guar gum caused the aggregation reduction of Mo2C NPS due to its high viscosity. The LSV and CV measurement in both alkaline and acidic media showed that the synthesized Mo2C/NCS had significant electrocatalytic activity and high stability during the electrochemical H2 production. The overpotentials at a current density of 10 mcm−2 were 189 mV and 142 mV in acidic and alkaline media, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the low Tafel slope of 56.1 mV/dec in the alkaline medium compared with acidic medium (61.2 mV/dec) showed better catalytic activity of Mo2C/NCS in alkaline solution [195]. In 2021, a series of metal single atoms anchored on nitrogen doped carbon aerogel (M-SA@NCA, M = Co, Ni, Mo) were synthesized using an in situ pre-cross-linking process by Cheng and co-workers. The guar gum was used as a source of carbon aerogels (CA). The HER activity of the catalysts was evaluated in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The experimental results showed that Co-SA@NCA exhibited high HER activity (close to commercial Pt/C) with an overpotential of 78.6 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm2 and Tafel slope of 109.6 mV/dec. The catalyst had supreme stability after 100 h with no significant changes [196]."
12,Pectin-based (nano)catalysts,"5.8 Pectin-based (nano)catalysts Pectin is a complex polysaccharide, which is a combination of linear α-(1,4) galacturonic acid residues joined in the chain by an α-(1–4) glycosidic connection consisting of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups. Homogalacturonan (HG), rhamnogalacturonan I, and rhamnogalacturonan II are various forms of pectin polymer. Since pectin structure can be modified to form derivatives, its biological and physicochemical properties can be improved to extend its applications. Pectin is found in peels of fruits and different plant cell walls. It is used as a stabilizer in the food industry because of its ability to form aqueous gels. Hence, pectin can be used for biomedical and cosmetic applications due to its biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-toxicity, hydrophilicity, and flexibility [36,197–199]. Fig. 41 shows the chemical structure, sources and food applications of pectin polymer. 5.8.1 Pectin-based (nano)catalysts for electrochemical hydrogen evolution Xu and co-workers developed a one-step hydrothermal route in the presence of melamine, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), pectin, ammonium molybdate, and nickel nitrate to synthesize molybdenum carbide and metallic nickel supported on an N-doped porous carbon matrix. The polymerization of pectin and melamine leads to the formation of the porous structure. The catalytic efficiency was tested in two alkaline (1.0 M KOH) and acidic (0.5 M H2SO4) solutions by an electrochemical cell consisting of three electrodes. The LSV plate in the acidic medium showed that Mo2C/Ni-CN had the smallest overpotential (170 mV) at 10 mA/cm2 compared to CN due to the porous structure of Mo2C/Ni-CN while an overpotential of 220 mV was obtained in alkaline medium. The Tafel slope of the catalyst in the alkaline electrolyte (61 mV/dec) was lower than that in an acidic electrolyte (64 mV/dec), which indicates the better HER catalytic activity of Mo2C/Ni-CN in the alkaline environment [200]."
13,Summary and discussion,"Applications of biopolymer-derived (nano)catalysts for hydrogen evolution have been reviewed in this paper. It is clear that the synthesized biopolymer-derived (nano)catalysts display excellent catalytic activity in hydrogen production. Based on the literature reports, there are no rules to predict the catalytic activity of these compounds. The comparison of these catalysts depends on the biopolymer type, surface area, composition of the catalyst, morphology, metal NP size, catalyst amount, reaction conditions, and the techniques used (HER, photocatalytic, and hydrolysis of hydrides) for hydrogen production."
14,Conclusion,"Global warming and environmental pollution are becoming considerable consequences, which need real attention in human lives. To obtain the energy demand, fossil fuels are mostly used to aggravate pollution and cause much harm to the environment. For many years, researchers have been trying to find different green and ecological methods to replace the conventional energies. As long as CO2 increases, which leads to terrible environmental contamination, hydrogen production is needed more every day. There are different processes to achieve this goal. This paper reviews different ecological biopolymers and techniques, which helps scientists needing eco-friendly polymers and clean processes in their research. HER photocatalytic technique and hydrolysis of hydrides are the most convenient. The produced hydrogen can be stored by physical and material based methods in energy systems. Material based methods are fast and cost efficient routes for hydrogen storage by chemical and physical interactions with high surface area and porous materials. Among materials, biodegradable polymers and polysaccharides are the best choices due to their biocompatibility, non-toxicity, small size, high surface area, and high porosity. According to the reports, these environmentally friendly compounds have functional groups, which can interact with water molecules. In addition, the polysaccharide family is an important carbon source for the hydrogen storage. Additionally, these biopolymers are synthesized through safe approaches from living materials such as plants and animals and are efficient in biomedical and industrial applications. Hence, cellulose, chitin, chitosan, alginate, starch, gum, pectin, collagen, and gelatin have been reviewed in this paper. However, some challenges can be addressed in the future studies: ➢ Creating appropriate and controlled laboratory conditions for easy, fast, and cost effective production of biopolymer-based catalysts ➢ Production of biopolymers from different biowastes for hydrogen production and storage applications ➢ More investigation of biopolymeric compounded with metal and metal oxide nanoparticles for hydrogen production and storage applications ➢ Using biopolymer-based catalysts on an industrial scale for hydrogen production and storage"
