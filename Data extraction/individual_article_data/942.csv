0,Introduction,"The growing interest in renewable energy has been recently necessitated by the need of diverting from the over-reliance on fossil fuels to sustainable energy sources such as bioenergy and hydrogen (H2). Among the proposed alternatives to fossil fuels, biodiesel is very attractive since it can be used without engine modification, i.e. drop-in biofuel. Biodiesel is currently being produced through the transesterification of vegetable oils with alcohols [1]. The main by-product from the biodiesel production is glycerol (i.e. 100 kg of glycerol per 1 ton biodiesel produced), which is an oxygenated hydrocarbon having a hydroxyl group on each carbon atom [2,3]. The current disposal method of glycerol is primarily incineration (at million metric tons scale per year in Europe), having significant environmental impact on the biodiesel industry and biofuel supply chain. Thus, valorisation of surplus glycerol from biodiesel production can not only mitigate the environmental impact (due to incineration) but also improve the economic viability of biomass utilisation (e.g. biodiesel). Catalytic steam reforming of glycerol (SRG) has shown the feasibility for producing renewable H2 [4], being highly beneficial due to the carbon neutrality of glycerol as the feedstock [5,6], as well as the relatively high hydrogen content in glycerol (theoretically, according to Eq. 1, 7 mol of H2 can be produced from 1 mol of glycerol). More importantly, H2, as clean energy, helps to reduce the dependency on fossil fuels with zero carbon emissions [7]. Additionally, SRG is regarded as one of the promising technologies since glycerol can be used as the drop-in feedstock for the current industrial hydrocarbon steam reforming processes, not requiring significant modification of the existing infrastructure. However, SRG has a more complex reaction network than the steam reforming of hydrocarbons, being prone to form by-products via side reactions, and thus affecting the selectivity to H2 [8]. As listed in Table S1 in the Supplementary Material, SRG may involve reactions of steam methane reforming (Eq. S2), thermal decomposition of glycerol (into CO and H2, Eq. S3), water-gas shift reaction (WGSR, Eq. S4), along with methanation reactions (Eqs. S5a–S5b), methane dry reforming (Eq. S6), and other detrimental side reactions which lead to carbon (C) deposition (Eqs. S7–S11) [7]. (1) C 3 H 8 O 3 + 3 H 2 O → 3 CO 2 + 7 H 2 Δ H 298 = 127.7 kJ ⋅ mol − 1 Different catalysts based on noble and transition metals have been developed and investigated to improve the production of H2 via SRG [9]. Adhikari et al. reviewed SRG catalysts and concluded that noble metals of platinum (Pt), ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh) and iridium (Ir) are the appropriate ones to enable the high yield of H2 [10]. The noble metal catalysts demonstrated high glycerol conversion (ca. 100%) at 500–800 °C, however, their relatively high costs may limit their applications at scales. Therefore, the development of cost-effective, active and stable transition metal catalysts for SRG is still desirable from the practical point of view. Among transition metals, Ni has been widely employed by reforming processes in industry due to its low cost and good ability of cleaving CC, OH and CH bonds, and hence good selectivity to H2 in reforming reactions. Various supported Ni catalysts such as Ni on γ-alumina (γ-Al2O3), silica (SiO2) and zirconia (ZrO2), i.e. Ni@γ-Al2O3, Ni@SiO2 and Ni@ZrO2, have been assessed for H2 production via SRG [11–13]. Sanchez et al. [13] studied SRG over Ni@γ-Al2O3 under reforming conditions (i.e. 700 °C, steam-to-glycerol feed ratio, SGFR = 3:1, and atmospheric pressure), showing that (i) H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 were the main products and (ii) carbon deposition deactivated the catalyst and compromised H2 production in SRG. Additionally, another major issue associated with the Ni-based catalysts is the deactivation due to the poor thermal stability particularly at temperatures (>800 °C, which causes metal sintering), and thus impeding a stable catalyst performance in reforming processes [14]. It has been shown that the activity and stability of the supported Ni catalysts can be improved by improving Ni dispersion via optimisation of the synthesis protocols and modification of the catalyst surface (e.g. using promoters) [15]. In addition to the active metal, the catalyst supports also play important roles in SRG. A suitable catalyst support for SRG should be resistant to the high temperatures and maintain the metal dispersion as high as possible during the reaction. Common supports for SRG are metal oxides such as γ-Al2O3, ZrO2 and SiO2 [16]. Among these, γ-Al2O3 has comparatively good properties such as high specific surface area (>100 m2·g−1) and appropriate pore size distribution (i.e. 2–20 nm), being suitable for developing reforming catalysts for SRG [17]. However, the acidic nature of γ-Al2O3 (mainly Lewis type surface acid sites) is one of the shortcomings for the purpose since it promotes acid catalysed reactions such as cracking and glycerol dehydration, which lead to significant coke formation and the associated catalyst deactivation [14]. Therefore, to mitigate the issues associated with γ-Al2O3, rare earth oxides, such as lanthana (La2O3) or ceria (CeO2), are used as promoters to modify the Ni@γ-Al2O3 catalysts for SRG, to suppress the coke formation, prevent Ni sintering, and sustain the catalyst stability and selectivity to H2, respectively [14,18,19]. For example, Charisiou et al. [19] showed that, in comparison with the Ni supported on pristine γ-Al2O3 catalyst (Ni@γ-Al2O3), the presence of La2O3 in the modified catalyst (i.e. Ni@La2O3-γ-Al2O3) behaved as a dispersant agent and improved the dispersion of metallic Ni on the support (i.e. 9.1% for Ni@La2O3-γ-Al2O3 vs. 3.9% for Ni@γ-Al2O3). As a result, comparatively high total glycerol conversion of ~90% and H2 yield of ~55% were achieved by Ni@La2O3-γ-Al2O3 at 750 °C. Similarly, ceria also showed the potential to improve the thermal stability of alumina whilst promoting the reduction of supported NiO species [20]. Iriondo et al. [21] examined the effect of CeO2 modification on the catalytic performance of Ni@γ-Al2O3 catalysts, regarding glycerol conversion and H2 yield at 500–600 °C, showing that the ceria modification (~20 wt%) enhanced the activity of the catalyst at 500 °C with ~100% glycerol conversion and ~30% H2 yield. Although CeO2 has shown the promise as the modifier for improving supported Ni catalysts for SRG, the stability of Ni supported on CeO2-modified γ-Al2O3 catalysts under the relevant reaction conditions needs further investigation for potential practical uses. Herein, this work reports the development of the Ni catalyst supported on CeO2-modified mesoporous γ-Al2O3 for catalytic SRG. The performance of the developed catalyst regarding (i) total glycerol conversion, (ii) glycerol conversion into gaseous products, (iii) H2 selectivity and yield and (iv) selectivity and yield of the gaseous products were systematically and comparatively studied (using the Ni supported on mesoporous γ-Al2O3 catalyst as the control) under different reaction temperatures of 550, 650 and 750 °C under steady state. The stability of the develop catalysts was investigated as a function of time-on-stream (ToS) for 12 h. The developed catalysts were characterised comprehensively using several techniques such as powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), N2 adsorption–desorption, H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), ammonia temperature programmed reduction (NH3-TPD), inductively couple plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), H2 chemisorption and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The carbon deposition on the catalysts was assessed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 99.99%) and cerium (III) nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)2·6H2O 99.99%) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich, and γ-Al2O3 was purchased from Alfa Aesar. All chemicals and materials were used as received. Ce modified γ-Al2O3 (i.e. Ce-Al2O3) was obtained by impregnating γ-Al2O3 using aqueous solutions of Ce(NO3)2·6H2O (with 6 wt% or 12 wt% of theoretical Ce loading, referred as 6Ce-Al2O3 and 12Ce-Al2O3) at room temperature (RT) for 6 h. The resulting supports were oven-dried overnight at 80 °C and calcined at 550 °C (temperature programme: from RT to 550 °C at 5 °C·min−1, isothermal at 550 °C for 6 h, cool down naturally to RT). Ni-based catalysts steam reforming reactions normally have the Ni content in a range of 8 wt%–16 wt% to avoid metal aggregation and sintering under the reaction conditions [2]. Therefore, this work prepared Ni supported on Ce-Al2O3 catalysts with 12 wt% theoretical Ni loading (via wet impregnation). Typically, Ce-Al2O3 support was impregnated with the desired amount of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O dissolved in water, and the precursor-support mixture was stirred for 6 h at RT, then oven-dried overnight at 80 °C. Finally, the resulting samples, which are denoted as Ni@6Ce-Al2O3 and Ni@12Ce-Al2O3, respectively, were calcined at 550 °C (same temperature programme as described above). A control catalyst of Ni supported on γ-Al2O3 with 12 wt% theoretical Ni loading (denoted as Ni@Al2O3) was also prepared using the same method and procedure."
3,Catalyst characterisation,"2.2 Catalyst characterisation XRD patterns of the calcined catalysts were collected using a Philips X'Pert X-ray diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 40 mA with a CuKα1 X-ray source (λ = 0.15406 nm) in a 2θ range of 20° to 80° with 0.02° step size. XRD patterns were analysed using JADE 6 (Materials Data Inc., Livermore, CA) to compare with the known structures in the International Centre for Diffraction Data database (ICDD) to identify relevant phases. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained at −196.15 °C using a Micromeritics 3Flex surface characterisation analyser to determine the specific BET surface area and pore size distributions (using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method, BJH) of the catalysts. Before analysis, all samples were degassed at 350 °C under vacuum overnight. A Quanta chrome ChemBET Pulsar TPR/TPD instrument (ChemBET-3000) equipped with a temperature-controlled furnace and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to perform H2-TPR. Prior to H2-TPR, the sample was pre-treated under Helium (He) at 300 °C for 30 min and then cooled down to RT. H2-TPR was carried out under a gas mixture flow of 5% H2 in Argon (Ar) at 30–800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C·min−1. During the analysis, H2 consumption was monitored continuously by TCD. NH3-TPD was performed using the same instrument to determine the surface acidity of the catalysts. Before NH3-TPD, the catalysts were saturated by NH3 (using 5% NH3 in Ar) for 2 h, and then He flow was used to sweep the samples (for 40 min) to remove the weakly adsorbed NH3. NH3-TPD was conducted with a heating rate of 10 °C·min−1 from 30 °C to 800 °C under He. H2 pulse chemisorption was conducted using a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument. Before the pulse chemisorption, the samples were reduced at 700 °C (for 1 h under 10% H2 in Ar at 30 ml min−1) and cooled down to 50 °C. Then, H2 pulse chemisorption was carried out by injecting a mixture of 10% H2/Ar (at 30 ml·min−1) periodically into the system. Ni surface area and dispersion were calculated by assuming that one hydrogen atom occupies one surface nickel atom. The actual Ni loading of the calcined catalysts was determined by ICP-OES (Plasma Quant PQ 9000). The catalyst was dissolved in an acidic solution (containing H2SO4, HNO3 and H3PO4) and microwaved-digested to obtain the solution for ICP-OES. The amount of coke formation on the used catalysts from SRG was determined by TGA (Q5000-IR TA Instruments) in air at 10 °C min−1, from RT to 900 °C, then isothermal at 900 °C for 1.5 h. The carbon content was determined by counting the weight loss at >500 °C after the removal of water and surface-adsorbed species. TEM analysis was performed on a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 electron microscope operated at 300 kV. The samples were dispersed in isopropyl alcohol, and a drop of the suspension was spread onto a TEM carbon grid and dried for imaging."
4,Catalysis,"2.3 Catalysis Catalytic SRG over the developed catalysts was conducted in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor (pellet sizes at 250–425 μm), consisting of a quartz tube with 12 mm inner diameter, held in an electric tube furnace (Carbolite, EVT-12) at atmospheric pressure, and the experimental rig is shown in Fig. 1 . Bed temperature was monitored using a K-type thermocouple (OMEGA®) located inside the catalyst bed (supported by quartz wool). Before catalysis, the packed catalyst (~200 mg) was reduced in situ at 800 °C under pure H2 (100 ml·min−1 (STP)) for 1 h. After reduction, H2 was replaced by pure N2 flow, and the bed temperature was adjusted to the desired reaction temperature. Subsequently, a mixture of water and glycerol (SGFR = 10:1) was fed via a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, PHD ULTRA) at a constant feed flow rate of 6 ml (STP)·h−1 into a vaporiser which was maintained at 320 °C to ensure the vaporisation of glycerol. N2 was used as the carrier gas, and total gas hourly space velocity (WHSV) corresponded to 44,122 ml·g−1·h−1, and gas flow rates were controlled by mass flow controllers (MKS instruments). The experiment was carried out at 550, 650 and 750 °C, respectively, and samples of the products were taken hourly at the exit of the reactor (via silica bed trap). The composition of the outlet gas stream was analysed by gas chromatograph (GC, PerkinElmer Clarus® 580) with HayeSep DB 100/120 mesh and Shin Carbon ST 100/120 mesh columns, and TCD and flame ionisation detector (FID). The condensable products (including the unreacted glycerol) were cooled in a condenser and collected at the reactor outlet for GC analysis (Agilent 7820A, with a Stabil-wax column and FID). The dry gas flowrate was measured using a bubble-flow meter, and the catalytic performance in the gas phase was represented by the total glycerol conversion (X T ), glycerol conversion into gaseous products (X GP ), selectivity (S) and yield (Y) towards the main products, i.e. H2, CO, CO2, CH4 (defined as in Table 1 ). Specifically, X GP is expressed as the ratio between the moles of carbon present in glycerol converted to carbon-containing gaseous products (i.e. CH4, CO and CO2) and the carbon moles at the reactor inlet (Eq. (2))."
5,Results and Discussion,
6,Characterisation of catalysts,"3.1 Characterisation of catalysts The crystalline phase of the prepared catalysts (after calcination) was analysed by XRD, as shown in Fig. 2 . For the all catalysts, the characteristic diffraction peaks of γ-Al2O3 (with cubic structure, JCPDS 46–1131) were detected at 2θ = 32.8°, 37.3°, 39.6°, 46.1°, 61.2°, 67.2°, 75.5° and 79.7°, respectively. Phase transformation of the γ-Al2O3 support was insignificant after calcination. Ni phases in the Ni@Al2O3 and Ni@Ce-Al2O3 catalysts were detected with peaks located at 2θ = 43.4° and 62.8° (JCPDS 44–1159), corresponding to the crystalline phases of NiO. For the Ni supported on 6Ce-Al2O3 and 12Ce-Al2O3 catalysts, the presence of ceria phase was confirmed by characteristic peaks at 2θ = 28.68°, 33.02°, 47.66° and 56.56° (JCPDS 34–0394), respectively, corresponding to the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 phase [22,23]. Comparatively, with the same theoretical Ni loading, the intensity of diffraction peaks of NiO species on Ni@6Ce-Al2O3 and Ni@12Ce-Al2O3 was weaker than that of Ni@Al2O3, indicating that NiO is more dispersed on the surface of ceria modified γ-Al2O3 in comparison with the pristine γ-Al2O3. Additionally, diffraction peaks related to mixed oxide phases of NiO were not measured for Ni@6Ce-Al2O3 and Ni@12Ce-Al2O3. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of materials under study are shown in Fig. 3 . and the corresponding textural properties, together with the elemental analysis of Ni content on the catalysts, are presented in Table 2 . The pristine γ-Al2O3 support and catalysts have type IV isotherms with the hysteresis loop due to the capillary condensation, suggesting mesoporous structure [24]. Specific BET surface area (S BET), pore volume (V p) and average pore size diameter (D p) of γ-Al2O3 was 107 m2·g−1, 0.59 cm3·g−1 and 21.9 nm, respectively, which were reduced in the Ni@Al2O3 catalyst due to Ni loading, that is, S BET = 70 m2·g−1, V p = 0.36 cm3·g−1 and D p = 20.7 nm. This could be partially attributed to pore blockage by Ni deposition, as evidenced by the analysis of pore size distribution (PSD) of the materials (as shown in Fig. S1). PSD of the pristine γ-Al2O3 (Fig. S1a) is relatively wide, ranging from 10 to 60 nm. After Ni loading, PSD of the catalysts was narrowed, centring at ~20 nm. Ce modification of γ-Al2O3 helped the preservation of the specific surface area and pore volume. ICP-OES analysis showed that the actual Ni loading on the catalysts under investigation was comparable at ~8.3 wt% (Table 2). In comparison with Ni@Al2O3 with the same theoretical Ni loading, Ni@6Ce-Al2O3 and Ni@12Ce-Al2O3 shows higher values in S BET and V p (as shown in Table 2). This could be related to the influence of CeO2 phase on the thermal stability of γ-Al2O3 [25]. In addition, the ceria modification of γ-Al2O3 was also beneficial to improve the Ni dispersion and surface area (by ten-fold according to H2 pulse chemisorption analysis, as shown in Table S2). TPR of the catalysts was performed to understand the reduction behaviour of the catalysts (as shown in Fig. 4 ), and hence determine the suitable temperature for catalyst activation prior to catalytic SRG. For the Ni@Al2O3 catalyst, the reduction of Ni species started at ~420 °C and finished at around 700 °C due to the strong guest-support interaction between Ni species and γ-Al2O3 [26]. Ce modification of γ-Al2O3 helped to improve the reducibility of the catalyst. Compared with that of Ni@Al2O3, the onset reducing temperature of the Ni@Ce-Al2O3 catalysts was relatively low at ~400 °C, as well as the peak temperatures, e.g. Ni@12Ce-Al2O3 exhibited a reduction peak located at ~480 °C. Addtionally, the relatively high Ni dispersion on Ni@12Ce-Al2O3 than that on Ni@Ce-Al2O3 could also facilitate the reduction of the catalyst. Based on the findings, temperatures at >700 °C are necessary to reduce the Ni catalysts completely. Ce modification of γ-Al2O3 promoted the Ni-support interaction, as evidenced by H2 chemisorption analysis (exemplified by the comparison between the selected catalysts of Ni@Al2O3 and Ni@12Ce-Al2O3, as shown in Table S2), improving Ni surface area and dispersion on Ce-Al2O3 in comparison with the pristine γ-Al2O3. Based on TEM analysis, as shown in Fig. 5 , Ni particle sizes of Ni@Al2O3 are primarily at ~20–25 nm (Fig. 5a–c). Conversely, Ni particles on Ni@12Ce-Al2O3 (as shown in Fig. 5d–f) are much smaller (i.e. at ~10–15 nm) and better dispersed, being in line with the findings by H2 chemisorption. In addition, NH3-TPD analysis (Fig. S2 and Table S3) also showed that Ce modification also reduced the surface acidity of the Ni@12Ce-Al2O3 catalyst. Compared with the counterpart catalyst supported on the pristine γ-Al2O3 (i.e. Ni@Al2O3), the total surface acidity of the Ni@12Ce-Al2O3 catalyst was reduced by about 26%, i.e. ~75 μmol·g−1 for Ni@12Ce-Al2O3 versus ~102 μmol·g−1 for Ni@Al2O3 (Table S3)."
7,Catalytic SRG over the catalysts,"3.2 Catalytic SRG over the catalysts Before catalytic SRG, the control experiment without a catalyst (i.e. blank experiment, as shown in Fig. 6 ) was conducted under the reaction conditions at 750 °C and atmospheric pressure, showing the thermal conversion of glycerol to gases with X GP (ca.11%) and Y H2 (ca.2.9%). With the presence of the supported Ni catalysts, the performance of the system for SRG regarding X GP and Y H2 was improved, especially the catalytic SRG over the Ni supported on Ce-Al2O3 catalysts. Catalytic SRG over the conventional Ni@Al2O3 catalyst showed the performance with X GP = 43.2% ± 0.8% and Y H2 = 33.5% ± 0.8%. Conversely, when the Ni@6Ce-Al2O3 and Ni@12Ce-Al2O3 catalysts were used, the performance of the catalytic system regarding X GP was improved by 21.1% (for Ni@6Ce-Al2O3) and 44.5% (for Ni@12Ce-Al2O3), respectively, as shown in Fig. 6a. Similar phenomena were also measured for the yield of H2 (as shown in Fig. 6b). Metallic Ni species are required during SRG for effective cleavage of the C–C and C–H bonds in glycerol. However, the nature of the supported Ni such as dispersion dictates the catalytic activity of the relevant catalysts, i.e. the improved Ni dispersion enhances the catalytic activity [9,15]. H2 chemisorption analysis showed the significantly improved Ni dispersion of Ni@12Ce-Al2O3 (at 0.2 m2·g−1) in comparison with Ni@Al2O3 (at 0.02 m2·g−1), explaining the measured enhancement in the catalytic performance of the Ni@Ce-Al2O3 catalysts. Additionally, the significant differences in X GP and Y H2 between the thermal and catalytic SRG systems can also be partially attributed to the variation of the space time due to the use of catalyst packing. The influence of reaction temperature on catalytic SRG was investigated, and the relevant results are presented in Table 3 . The reaction temperature showed a significant effect on the catalytic performance of the supported Ni catalysts. For all the catalysts under investigation, an increase in temperature improved the glycerol conversion (X T ) considerably due to the endothermic nature of SRG reaction [Eq. (1)]. Interestingly, for the Ni@Al2O3 catalyst, at 550 °C, the total glycerol conversion, glycerol conversion into gases, yields of H2 and carbon-containing products are rather low, as shown in Table 3. At 650 °C, H2 formation was favoured, that is, Y H2 ( 53.5%) with X T ( ca. 98.7%) and X GP ( ca. 56.3%). However, the performance of Ni@Al2O3 for H2 production was retarded at a higher temperature of 750 °C with X GP ( ca. 43.2%) and Y H2 ( 33.5%), respectively. This was likely be due to the carbon deposition on poorly dispersed Ni phases at a relatively high temperature which lead to the deactivation of Ni@Al2O3 during the catalysis. Ce modification of γ-Al2O3 support improved Ni dispersion, and thus the performance of the Ni@Ce-Al2O3 catalysts as a functional of reaction temperature, i.e. (i) progressive increases in X T , X GP and Y H2 were measured for both Ni@6Ce-Al2O3 and Ni@12Ce-Al2O3 and (ii) Ni@6Ce-Al2O3 and Ni@12Ce-Al2O3 showed much better performance at the high temperature of 750 °C in comparison with that of Ni@Al2O3. Taking the Ni@12Ce-Al2O3 catalyst as example, by raising the temperature from 550 °C to 750 °C, X GP of SRG over the Ni@12Ce-Al2O3 catalyst were improved from 3.0% to 77.9%, representing a 2497% enhancement. In comparison with the Ni@Al2O3 catalyst, at the low temperatures of 550 or 650 °C, the performance of Ni@6Ce-Al2O3 and Ni@12Ce-Al2O3 with respect to X T , X GP and Y i was rather similar or relatively poor. On the other hand, at 750 °C, the glycerol conversion into gaseous products and H2 yield of Ni@6Ce-Al2O3 and Ni@12Ce-Al2O3 (i.e. X GP = 54.8% and Y H2 = 43.8% for Ni@6Ce-Al2O3 and X GP = 77.9% and Y H2 = 62.6% for Ni@12Ce-Al2O3, respectively) are much better than that of the Ni@Al2O3 catalyst. Table S4 shows the calculated specific rate of H2 production (r H2 ), turnover frequency (TOF), activation energy (E a ) for SRG over Ni@Al2O3 and Ni@12Ce-Al2O3. Specifically, at 750 °C, the Ni@12Ce-Al2O3 catalyst showed the highest r H2 (14.4 × 10−5 mol·s−1·g−1) and TOF (3412 s−1), representing a nearly 2-fold increase compared with that of Ni@Al2O3 (r H2 = 7.7 × 10−5 mol·s−1·g−1, TOF = 1823 s−1). SRG is endothermic, and hence, relatively high temperatures are desired for improving H2 production. However, the relatively poor Ni dispersion on the conventional γ-Al2O3 might result in the poor performance and the associated catalyst deactivation. By adopting the strategy of Ce modification of the pristine γ-Al2O3, improvement in the Ni dispersion on the resulting support was achieved, and hence enabled the high performance of catalytic SRG over the Ni@Ce-Al2O3 catalysts. Additionally, according to the results by NH3-TPD (Fig. S2 and Table S3) the acidity of Ni@12Ce-Al2O3 was lower than that of Ni@Al2O3, promoting glycerol conversion into H2, CO2, CO and CH4, respectively. At 750 °C, carbon balances of the catalytic systems over Ni@Al2O3 and Ni@12Ce-Al2O3 were estimated as about 46% and 78%, respectively (as shown in Fig. S3), suggesting the possible severe carbon deposition on Ni@Al2O3."
8,Assessment of catalyst stability,"3.3 Assessment of catalyst stability The development of stable catalysts for H2 production from SRG is crucial. In order to highlight and compare the stability performance of the catalysts under investigation, especially Ni@12Ce-Al2O3, the comparative stability tests were carried out using the Ni@Al2O3 catalyst as the control under the conditions of T = 750 °C, SGFR = 10:1 and WHSV = 44,122 ml·g−1·h−1. The performance of the two catalysts as a function of time-on-stream (ToS) is shown in Figs. 7 and S4. Figs. 7a, c and S4a show the gradual decreases in X T , X GP and Y H2 during the stability test over the Ni@Al2O3 catalyst, i.e. by 1.4%, 19.3% and 17.3%, respectively after 12 h on stream. Deactivation of the Ni supported on acidic γ-Al2O3 by coke deposition could be attributed to the dehydration reactions over the acidic sites on the prestine γ-Al2O3 [27]. Additionally, the depreciating H2 yield over ToS of 6–12 h could be related with the H2 consumption by CO and CO2 reduction reactions (Eq. S9 and Eq. S10), which generate coke deposition as well. The selectivity of Ni@Al2O3 in SRG to gaseous products of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 was rather stable, especially for ToS of <6 h, whilst minimal variations in the selectivity were measured over ToS of 6–12 h. This could be attributed to the temeprature dependence of the relevant reactions such as SRG (Eq. 1), methanation (Eqs. S5a and S5b) and coke formation reactions (Eqs. S7–S9), as well as the activity of the catalyst. As shown in Figs. 7b, d and S4b, the Ni@12Ce-Al2O3 catalyst demonstrated a very stable catalytic performance in SRG over 12 h ToS with X T = 99.3% ± 0.4%, X GP = 73.9% ± 1.9% and Y H2 = 62.9% ± 1.0%, highlighting the advantage of Ni@12Ce-Al2O3 over Ni@Al2O3. Ni-based catalysts are prone to experience coke deposition and sintering during reforming reactions, especially at relatively high temperatures. The work showed that the coke formation of Ni catalysts and the associated deactivation can be mitigated by ceria modification of the γ-Al2O3 support. This is confirmed by the post-reaction TGA of the used catalysts from the stability tests, as shown in Fig. 8 . As can be seen in Fig. 8a, the initial weight loss at <200 °C during TGA of the used catalysts is attributed to the removal of water from the catalysts. At 200–500 °C, the weight loss under the oxidising conditions can be explained by the combustion of residual species such as reactants and products on catalyst surface [28]. At T > 500 °C, coke deposition starts to burn off and the relative weight loss from 500 to 800 °C of the used Ni@Al2O3 catalyst was quantified at ~19%. As can be observed in Fig. 8b, the peak at 650 °C of the derivative weight loss can be associated with coke combustion from the catalyst surface [28]. Conversely, for the used Ni@12Ce-Al2O3 catalyst, coke formation during SRG was suppressed as indicated by the comparatively insignificant peak detected at 610 °C (Fig. 8b), and only ~5% relative weight loss was measured by TGA, demonstrating the comparatively high coke resistance owing to ceria modification of the γ-Al2O3 support. In general, Ce modification promoted the Ni dispersion with smaller Ni particle and fast turnover during the catalysis, which might maintain the initial purity of the catalyst surface and enhance its stability."
9,Conclusions,"Catalytic steam reforming of glycerol (SRG) is a promising method to convert waste glycerol into valuable and renewable hydrogen. Supported Ni catalysts are economic candidates for enabling the reforming reactions but suffering from the deactivation due to sintering and coke deposition during the catalysis, especially at high temperatures. This work presented the development of Ni supported on Ce modified γ-Al2O3 catalysts and the comparative reforming catalysis of glycerol (for H2 production) at 550–750 °C, atmospheric pressure and WHSV of 44,122 ml·g−1·h−1 (STP). The findings showed that Ce modification of γ-Al2O3 improved the surface properties (i.e. specific BET surface area > 103 m2·g−1 and pore volume > 0.4 cm3·g−1) for improving Ni dispersion, and thus enabling the comparatively high total glycerol conversion (ca. 99%), glycerol conversion into gaseous products (ca. 78%) and H2 yield (ca. 63%) over the resulting catalyst (i.e. Ni@12Ce-Al2O3). Specifically, the developed Ni@12Ce-Al2O3 catalyst are highly stable at a high temperature of 750 °C, maintaining a steady glycerol conversion into gaseous products and H2 production with minimised coke deposition. Since supported Ni catalysts are widely used by reforming reactions including steam reforming of hydrocarbons (i.e. methane) and oxygenated hydrocarbons (i.e. alcohols). Therefore, the developed strategy can find extended applications in other reforming reactions."
