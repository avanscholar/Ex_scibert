0,Introduction,"The liver is the most important metabolic organ, and also the center for alcohol metabolism, more than 80% of the ingested alcohol is metabolized in the liver (Stornetta et al., 2018). Moreover, with the increase in alcohol consumption, the incidence of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is higher and higher, which has become a serious health problem and raised worldwide concern (Seitz et al., 2018). According to the severity of liver damage, ALD includes alcoholic fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, alcoholic liver fibrosis, alcoholic liver cirrhosis and alcoholic liver cancer (Guan et al., 2018). Although ALD has a profound harmful effect, little progress has been made in the prevention and treatment of ALD, particularly through prevention (Gao and Bataller, 2011). Hence, the search for alternative drugs or supplements with hepatoprotective properties has attracted more interest. Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced during alcohol metabolism, and oxidative stress is the main mechanism in the pathogenesis of ALD (Cai et al., 2018). Increasing application of antioxidants and improving antioxidant capacity in the liver have been considered as potential targets for the prevention and treatment of liver damage caused by oxidative stress (Tang et al., 2013). Moreover, recent research indicates that many natural food-derived antioxidant peptides have certain effects on preventing ALD, including corn peptides (Yu et al., 2017), chicken meat peptides (Lin et al., 2017), and coix seed peptides (Chen et al., 2020). Soybean meal is the by-product of soybean oil extraction or extrusion, which is widely used in food and animal feed industries as a protein source, compared with other vegetal protein sources, it has high protein content (43%~48%) and relatively balanced amino acid protein (Li et al., 2019b). According to previous studies, the soybean meal peptides (SPs) have multiple physiologically active functions, including antioxidation (Yang et al., 2019), anti-inflammatory (Li et al., 2019a), and hypertension (Ruan et al., 2020), suggesting that it has potential to exhibit hepatoprotective properties by interfering with oxidative stress. However, studies on the hepatoprotective effect of SPs have not been reported. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the protective effect of SPs on alcoholic liver injury and investigate the possible mechanism. We assessed the in vitro antioxidant activity and cytotoxicity of SPs, further evaluated its protective potential against alcohol-induced liver injury and investigated its possible protective mechanisms based on transcriptome analysis. The results obtained in this study could be valuable for developing hepatoprotective functional food or dietary supplement using SPs."

3,Preparation of SPs,"2.2 Preparation of SPs The SPs were prepared as in Fig. 1 A. Soybean meal was crushed and passed through 60 mesh. Then, soybean meal powder was suspended in distilled water to make a 9% protein solution and ultrasonic treatment with 300 W for 9 min. The solution was denatured at 90 °C for 10 min and adjusted pH to 8.0. Then Alcalase (6665.39 U/g) was added and stirred at 50 °C for 4 h. In the end, the enzyme was inactivated by heating at 90 °C for 10 min. The hydrolyzed solution was centrifuged at 1698 g, 4 °C for 20 min, the supernatant was used in subsequent separation and purification stages.

4,Chemical antioxidant assays of SPs,"2.3 Chemical antioxidant assays of SPs 2.3.1 ABTS radical scavenging capacity assay The ABTS assay was measured according to a previous method (Balcerczyk et al., 2007; Re et al., 1999). In addition, the ABTS radical scavenging capacity of samples was expressed as the IC50 value and Trolox equivalent (mg TE/100 mg sample). 2.3.2 Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay The FRAP assay was evaluated the ability of ferric iron (Fe3+) to ferrous iron (Fe2+) by measuring the OD value at 593 nm (Benzie and Strain, 1996) and measured using an analytical kit refer to the manufacturer's instructions. Furthermore, the FRAP value was expressed as Fe2+ equivalent (mmol Fe2+/100 mg sample). 2.3.3 Oxygen radical absorption capacity (ORAC) assay The ORAC assay was determined according to a previous protocol (Davalos et al., 2004; Ou et al., 2001), and the ORAC value was expressed as Trolox equivalent (mg TE/100 mg sample)."
5,Cell-based antioxidant assays of SPs,"2.4 Cell-based antioxidant assays of SPs 2.4.1 Cell culture Caco-2 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% nonessential amino acid solution, 100 units/mL of penicillin, 100 μg/mL of streptomycin, and 4 mM of L-glutamine, incubated in 5% CO2 and 90% relative humidity at 37 °C (Wang et al., 2015). The cells were grown in a culture flask with a fresh medium replaced every other day. Cell passage numbers 10 were used in the experiments. 2.4.2 Viability/cytotoxicity assay The cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay (Mosmann, 1983) and evaluated using an analytical kit refer to the manufacturer's instructions. For cell viability assays 80 μL of 1.0 × 104 cells/mL were seeded onto 96-well plates. The cells were cultured for 12 h before treatment with SPs (0.1–1.5 mg/mL). After the cells had been treated with 10 μL of SPs for 6 h, an MTT solution (20 μL) was added and incubated for 4 h. The OD value was measured at 490 nm, then the cell viability was calculated. 2.4.3 Induction of oxidative stress The oxidative stress was induced to Caco-2 cells by adding 100 μM H2O2 (Garcia-Nebot et al., 2011). The 80 μL of Caco-2 cells (1.0 × 104 cells/mL) were inoculated into 96-well culture plates and cultured for 12 h. The cells were then incubated for 6 h with 10 μL of SPs (0.1–1.0 mg/mL). Cells were washed twice with PBS, followed by the addition of 100 μM H2O2 (10 μL) for 2 h. At the end of 4 h, the cell viability was determined by the MTT method, and the levels of intracellular ROS were determined according to the manufacturer's instructions."
6,Animals and treatments,"2.5 Animals and treatments A previously described mouse model of acute alcoholic liver injury was used (Song et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2017). Forty healthy ICR male mice (weight 20.00 ± 2 g) were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd (SCXK (Jing) 2019–0012). Mice were housed with 4 mice per cage in the Experimental Animal Center of the First Hospital of Jilin University (constant temperature 24 ± 1 °C, relative humidity 65%, and 12 h light/dark cycle) with free access to chow and water. After one week of acclimatization, the mice were randomized into five groups (n = 8): control (CK), alcohol (M), GSH + alcohol (GSH), low dose-SPs + alcohol (L-SPs), high dose-SPs + alcohol (H-SPs). During the 1–8 day at 8:00 a.m., the CK and the M groups treated normal saline, the GSH group was given 50 mg/kg bw of GSH, the SPs treatment groups received 50 mg/kg bw (L-SPs) and 100 mg/kg bw (H-SPs) of SPs, respectively. On the 8-day at 9:00 a.m., except the CK group continued treated with equal normal saline, all the other groups were administered alcohol (50%, v/v) by gavage at a dose of 12 mL/kg bw three times at 12 h intervals (Fig. 1 B). The mice were fasted 4 h after the third dose of alcohol and euthanized. Blood samples were collected from eyeballs and centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain serum. Partial liver and kidney tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for histopathological analysis by Hematoxylin-Eosin Stain (HE), while the other liver samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until analysis (Ge et al., 2021)."
7,Biochemical assays of serum and liver tissue,"2.6 Biochemical assays of serum and liver tissue Serum levels of AST, ALT, TC, and TG were determined by detection kits according to the manufacturer's instructions. The liver tissue homogenates were prepared by mixing with saline at the ratio of 1: 9 (w: v) and centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. The liver levels of SOD, GSH, CAT, and MDA were measured by using a commercial kit refer to the manufacturer's instructions."
8,RNA extraction and illumina novaseq sequencing,"2.7 RNA extraction and illumina novaseq sequencing Using TRIzol® reagent to extract total RNA from the liver tissue according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, US), and using DNase I to remove genomic DNA (Takara, Japan). Then the quality of RNA was measured by 2100 Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies, US), and quantified using the NanoDrop ND-2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, US). Using 1 μg total RNA to prepare RNA-seq transcriptome library follow TruSeq™ RNA sample preparation Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, US). Firstly, using oligo(dT) beads pair with polyA to isolate mRNA and then the fragmentation of mRNA. Secondly, transforming mRNA into cDNA, then the synthesized cDNA was subjected to end-repair, phosphorylation and ‘A’ base addition. Finally, libraries were selected for cDNA target fragments of 300 bp on 2% Low Range Ultra Agarose, followed by PCR amplified and quantified, RNA-seq sequencing library was sequenced with the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (2 × 150 bp read length) according to the standard protocols by Majorbio Bio-Pharm Technology Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China)."
9,Bioinformatic analysis,"2.8 Bioinformatic analysis The sequencing data were counted and quality controlled by SeqPrep (https://github.com/jstjohn/SeqPrep) and Sickle (https://github.com/najoshi/sickle), then using HISAT2 (http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml) (Kim et al., 2015) to compare the quality control data with the reference genome (Mus_musculus) and obtain Mapped data for subsequent analysis. The Read Counts of each sample gene can be obtained by using RSEM (http://deweylab.biostat.wisc.edu/rsem/) (Li and Dewey, 2011), and the standardized gene expression level was calculated based on the transcripts per million reads (TPM) method, thereby identify DEGs (differentially expressed genes) between two different samples. Since this experiment has biological replicates (n = 3), DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) was used for differential gene expression analysis, when DEGs with fold change > 2 or < −2 and p-value < 0.05 were considered to be significantly DEGs. In addition, perform functional-annotation and functional-enrichment analysis of DEGs, including GO and KEGG. Annotation analysis mainly uses the GO database (http://www.geneontology.org/) and the KEGG database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/). The software Goatools (https://github.com/tanghaibao/Goatools) and KOBAS (http://kobas.cbi.pku.edu.cn/home.do) (Xie et al., 2011) were used for GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, meanwhile, the Pvalue was corrected by Bonferroni method, when Padjust < 0.05, it is considered to be significantly enriched in GO terms and KEGG pathways."
10,Statistical analysis,2.9 Statistical analysis All experimental results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation from at least three independent experiments unless otherwise specified. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Duncan's test at P < 0.05 were performed to determine statistically significant differences among the samples using BONC DSS Statistics 25 software.
11,Results and discussion,
12,Chemical antioxidant activities of SPs,"3.1 Chemical antioxidant activities of SPs In ordinary, a single chemical antioxidant assay may not reflect the true antioxidant potential of compounds, because different mechanisms implied different antioxidant capacities (Dontha, 2016). Therefore, in this study, the chemical antioxidant activity of SPs was assessed by three assays, the ABTS assay and the FRAP assay based on secure electronic transfer, while the ORAC assay based on hydrogen atom transfer. For ABTS free radicals (Fig. 2 A), when the concentration of SPs increased from 0.05 to 5 mg/mL, the scavenging ability was improved from 4.53 ± 1.25 to 95.59 ± 0.26%, the corresponding IC50 value was 0.55 ± 0.03 mg/mL, and the Trolox equivalent was 11.94 ± 0.41 mg TE/100 mg peptide. Also, in terms of Fe3+ reducing ability (Fig. 2 B), SPs was showed a concentration dependence, and the FRAP value was 6.42 ± 0.32 mmol Fe2+/100 mg peptide when the concentration was 30 mg/mL. About oxygen radical absorption capacity (Fig. 2 C), SPs and Trolox inhibited the decay of fluorescein sodium, the ORAC value of SPs was 14.78 ± 0.01 mg TE/100 mg peptide. In the present study, it was found that the chemical antioxidant activities of SPs, particularly the ABTS radical scavenging ability, were higher than that of seaweed protein hydrolysate (Cian et al., 2012). The FRAP was also better than those reported for rapeseed protein hydrolysate (He et al., 2013). In addition, the data about ORAC was similar to the results for sea squirt protein hydrolysates (Kim et al., 2018). Furthermore, it was found that the order of chemical antioxidant activities of SPs was ORAC > ABTS radical scavenging activity > FRAP in our study. This may due to different antioxidant systems and mechanisms. Overall, the SPs were more effective electron or hydrogen donators with strong antioxidant activities."
13,Cytotoxicity of SPs,"3.2 Cytotoxicity of SPs The MTT assay was performed to examine any possibilities that SPs were toxic to Caco-2 cells before intracellular antioxidant assays. As shown in Fig. 2 D, no significant difference (P > 0.05) was observed between the cells treated with SPs at different concentrations (0–1.5 mg/mL), indicating that there were no cytotoxic effects towards Caco-2 cells at the tested concentrations. Interestingly, pretreatment of SPs increased the cell viability with a dose-dependent effect, the cell viability was enhanced to 108.08 ± 0.05% at peptides concentrations of 0.75 mg/mL. Our result was similar to several previous studies reporting that peptides were not cytotoxicity (Chan and Yeung, 2006; Marggraf et al., 2018)."
14,Cell-based antioxidant activities of SPs,"3.3 Cell-based antioxidant activities of SPs In general, the antioxidant activity of compounds is measured using chemical assays. However, cellular absorption under physiological conditions should also be considered to evaluate the antioxidant compounds. In this study, the antioxidant activity of SPs was evaluated using Caco-2 cells. Before cell-based antioxidant assays, the MTT assay was performed to examine the viability of cells exposed to an H2O2 environment. As shown in Fig. 2 E, the viability of cells decreased significantly to 24.95 ± 0.25% (P < 0.05) under H2O2 treatment. Although pretreatment with SPs improved the viability of cells up to 36.482 ± 0.365%, there was no difference compared with the H2O2 treatment group. To investigate the cellular antioxidant activity of SPs, the generation of intracellular ROS was assessed. The result was shown in Fig. 2 F, a significant increase (P < 0.05) in intracellular ROS level was observed in the presence of H2O2 as compared to cells without H2O2 treatment. Moreover, pretreatment of cells with SPs significantly decreased ROS content in a dose-dependent manner. When the concentration of SPs was 0.75 mg/mL, the ROS level was equivalent to that of untreated cells. The results suggested that SPs were effectively protected Caco-2 cells against H2O2-induced oxidative damage. It is speculated that SPs could activate some signal pathways related to the cellular defense system against oxidative stress, thereby eliminate intracellular ROS (Liu et al., 2014)."
15,Effect of SPs on serum AST/ALT and serum lipid levels,"3.4 Effect of SPs on serum AST/ALT and serum lipid levels The levels of ALT and AST in serum, as two important indicators of hepatocyte injury were determined. Generally, elevated AST was lower than ALT, so if the AST/ALT is > 1.5 indicates serious liver damage by alcohol (Giannini et al., 1999). The result was shown in Fig. 3 A, the M group had higher AST/ALT as compared to the CK group (P < 0.01), and the AST/ALT was >2. More cytoplasmic enzymes AST were released into serum after alcohol administration, indicating the damage caused in liver tissue. The AST/ALT in serum was reduced by GSH and SPs (L- and H-) groups, except for the L-SPs group, the GSH and H-SPs groups were significant (P < 0.05). Moreover, SPs ameliorated alcohol-induced increases in AST/ALT in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, alcohol-induced liver damage also leads to lipid metabolism disorders and accumulation of T-CHO and TG in serum. Therefore, the effect of SPs on lipid metabolism in alcohol-induced mice was also investigated. The changes of serum T-CHO and TG were shown in Fig. 3 B and C, respectively. The levels of T-CHO and TG in the M group were significantly higher than those of the CK group (P < 0.05), especially for the TG levels (P < 0.01). After preintervention with GSH and SPs (L- and H-), the T-CHO content was reduced by 20.41%, 0.61% and 14.81% compared with the M group, respectively. Meanwhile, the TG content was reduced to 2.26 times, 2.59 times and 2.13 times of the CK group, respectively. These results may suggest the potential of using SPs to modulate or reverse dyslipidemia in mice as induced by alcohol and prevent the progression of alcohol-induced fatty liver. These results were similar to those previously reported, which showed that the administration of active peptides alleviated liver damage and reduced lipid accumulation (Wang et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2017)."
16,Effect of SPs on alcohol-induced oxidative stress,"3.5 Effect of SPs on alcohol-induced oxidative stress Oxidative stress generated by alcohol metabolism is reportedly a major driver of alcohol-induced liver damage (Sugimoto and Takei, 2017). To assess the redox status of mice livers and the liver-protective antioxidant effects of SPs, the levels of T-SOD (Fig. 3 D), GSH (Fig. 3 E), CAT (Fig. 3 F), and MDA (Fig. 3 G) were measured. SOD is necessary for the endogenous antioxidant defense system to scavenge ROS and maintain the cellular redox balance (Sen Raychaudhuri and Deng, 2000). GSH and SPs (L- and H-) administration ameliorated reductions in alcohol-induced T-SOD activity. GSH constitutes the first line of defense against free radicals in living organisms, thus GSH content is an important measure of antioxidant capacity (Wang et al., 2020). Compared to that in the M group, GSH content in livers of GSH and SPs (L- and H-) groups was markedly increased (P < 0.01–0.05). Specifically, GSH content was increased by 1.96 times following SPs administration at 50 mg/kg·bw, which was similar to that in the GSH group at the same dose. CAT protects cells from damage by catalyzing H2O2 into O2 and H2O without producing toxic free radicals (Bocchetti and Regoli, 2006). The CAT levels in the M group were 30.20% lower than in the CK group. Comparing with the M group, CAT levels in GSH, L-SPs and H-SPs were increased by 11.95%, 3.58% and 11.92%, respectively. The above results suggested that SPs protected alcohol-induced oxidative stress of the liver by increasing the levels of the major antioxidant enzymes SOD, GSH and SOD in the liver. In addition, these results indicated that SPs also have in vivo antioxidant activity. MDA is one of the main end products of liver lipid peroxidation, it's content reflective of the severity of hepatic injury following the free radical attack (Guo et al., 2009). Fig. 3 G showed that alcohol intake increased hepatocyte MDA content to 0.50 ± 0.07 U/g protein, which was 1.39-fold higher than that in the CK group, indicating that alcohol intake increased oxidative stress in hepatocytes. GSH and SPs (L- and H-) treatment attenuated lipid-peroxidation levels, especially in the L- and H-SPs groups, in which MDA content decreased by 19.40% and 13.48%, respectively, relative to levels in the M group. The results showed that SPs prevented the lipid peroxidation caused by alcohol."
17,Effect of SPs on histopathology of liver and kidney,"3.6 Effect of SPs on histopathology of liver and kidney To further explore the toxic effects of SPs, both the histopathological examination of liver and kidney were evaluated (Ge et al., 2020). As shown in Fig. 3 H, the liver cells from the CK group have intact structures, dense arrangements and the absence of pathological changes. In the M group, the liver cord was arranged in disorder, some hepatic sinusoids disappeared, lipid droplets of various sizes were accumulated in the cytoplasm. The nuclei were translocated to the cell periphery, meanwhile appeared pyknosis and dissolution. These pathological changes suggested that alcohol stimulation caused severe liver damage. However, compared with the M group, intervention with GSH and SPs (L- and H-) alleviated alcohol-induced pathological changes in the liver. Although certain pathological changes such as lysed nuclei were still visible, most symptoms were markedly alleviated that the morphology and structure of hepatocytes were more compact and regular. These histological observations confirmed the results obtained by measuring biochemical indices and support our findings that SPs exhibits liver-protective effects. The kidney results were shown in Fig. 3 I. For the CK group, the renal tubular epithelial cells showed regular and tightly arranged, the structure was clear and complete. Conversely, alcohol-feeding induced slight kidney injury features in the M group, characterized by a fusion of epithelial cells and narrowed cavity structure. The kidney tissue morphology in mice treated with GSH and SPs (L- and H-) were similar to that of the CK group. The structural observations of the kidney were consistent with the results obtained in the cytotoxicity assay, which again confirmed the non-toxic effect of SPs."
18,Quality assessment of total RNA and RNA sequencing data analysis,"3.7 Quality assessment of total RNA and RNA sequencing data analysis Before RNA sequencing, the quality of total RNA extracted from the liver was evaluated, including purity, concentration, integrity and RIN value (Fig. S1, S2, and Table S1). The results showed that the OD 260/280 ≥ 1.95, OD 260/230 ≥ 2.14, concentration >1000 ng/μL, and the RIN value ≥ 7.00 of total RNA extracted from each sample. In addition, the electrophoretic strips of each sample were clear, without contamination by impurities, and the brightness of 28S was greater than 18S. The above results indicated that the extracted total RNA can be used for RNA sequencing. Statistical analysis was performed on the Raw reads obtained by sequencing and the Clean reads after quality control (Table S3). In this RNA sequencing, 549,735,760 Raw reads and 545,958,348 Clean reads were obtained. The average error rate of sequenced bases was about 0.02%, Q20 was 97%, and Q30 was 91%. Moreover, the GC content in the same group was close. After that, the Clean reads were compared with the reference genome (Mus_musculus). Table S2 shows that the total mapped was >90%, the multiple mapped was 9%–40%, and uniquely mapped was 56%–85%. Our sequencing results showed that the quality control of RNA sequencing data was good and the selected reference genome was appropriate."
19,Analysis of expressed genes and DEGs between samples,"3.8 Analysis of expressed genes and DEGs between samples The expressed genes between samples were analyzed by Venn analysis, correlation analysis and PCA analysis. For Venn analysis (Fig. 4 A), in CK, M, GSH and SPs groups, the common genes were 7280, the unique genes were 662, 684, 214 and 363, respectively. In terms of correlation analysis (Fig. 4 B), except for the poor correlation between GSH_2 with GSH_1 (0.14) and GSH_3 (0.16), the correlation coefficients of the other groups were above 0.8. About PCA analysis (Fig. 4 C), similarly, besides GSH_2, the degree of aggregation between samples was higher in other groups. Therefore, GSH_2 was judged as a discrete sample and eliminated in subsequent analysis. The results of the analysis of DEGs in the injury (M) and intervention (GSH and SPs) groups were obtained based on the reference genome. Fig. 4 D showed that a total of 1456 genes were significantly differentially expressed in alcohol-induced, with 807 up-regulated and 649 down-regulated. After preintervention with GSH (Fig. 4 E) and SPs (Fig. 4 F), the DEGs were 1373 (696 up-regulated and 677 down-regulated) and 1737 (1076 up-regulated and 661down-regulated) by the M group as control, respectively. In particular, up-regulated genes were more than down-regulated genes in intervention groups."
20,Functional annotation and enrichment analysis of Gene Set,"3.9 Functional annotation and enrichment analysis of Gene Set With the opposite up- and down-regulation of expressed genes, the DEGs in injury and intervention groups were screened to construct Gene Set (Table S4). The Gene Set was analyzed and classified into three main types based on Gene Ontology (GO), including biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions (Fig. 5 A). The top three were cell part (163 genes, cellular components), cellular process (148 genes, biological processes), and binding (148 genes, molecular functions). Similarly, Gene Set was assessed and classified into six main types based on the KEGG pathway: human diseases, organic systems, cellular processes, environmental information processing, genetic information processing, and metabolism (Fig. 5 B). The top three were signal transduction (31 genes, environmental information processing), immune system (21 genes, organic systems), and endocrine system (20 genes, organic systems). The results of the GO enrichment analysis of Gene Set showed that the main functions of these genes were related to inflammation, oxidative stress and lipid metabolism (Fig. 5 C), for instance, acute inflammatory response (13 genes), lipid biosynthetic process (18 genes), response to lipopolysaccharide (20 genes), cellular response to lipopolysaccharide (12 genes), response to oxygen-containing compound (46 genes), response to lipid (31 genes), and inflammatory response (18 genes). Interestingly, the nine metabolic pathways with significant enrichment functions (Padjust < 0.05) in the KEGG enrichment analysis were also related to inflammation, oxidative stress and lipid metabolism (Fig. 5 D), including cortisol synthesis and secretion (5 genes), TNF signaling pathway (6 genes), steroid hormone biosynthesis (7 genes), aldosterone synthesis and secretion (6 genes), JAK-STAT signaling pathway (7 genes), IL-17 signaling pathway (6 genes), drug metabolism-cytochrome P450 (5 genes), cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (8 genes), and cushing syndrome (6 genes)."
21,Mechanisms of SPs in preventing acute alcoholic liver injury,"3.10 Mechanisms of SPs in preventing acute alcoholic liver injury According to the transcriptome analysis results, we found that alcoholic liver injury affected the expression of various genes which could mediate the normal function of multiple pathways, ultimately lead to abnormal expression of various proteins. Therefore, to further explore related genes by drawing an enriched chord diagram of the KEGG pathway (Fig. 5E–G). After preintervention with SPs (Fig. 5 G), with M group as control, Gm3776, Aqp4, Hsd3b2, etc. were significantly up-regulated, while Lcn2, Tnfsf14, Cxcl1, etc. were significantly down-regulated. Interestingly, most of these genes could alleviate alcohol-induced liver damage by regulating genes related to inflammation, lipid metabolism and oxidation. The B cell leukemia 3 (Bcl3), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein δ (Cebpd), colony stimulating factor 2 receptor, β chain (Csf2rb), CXC chemokine ligand 1 (Cxcl1), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (Icam1), interleukin-17A (Il17ra), interleukin 1 receptor 1 (Il1r1), Junb, lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), oncostatin M receptor (Osmr), S100 calcium binding protein A8 (S100a8), S100 calcium binding protein A9 (S100a9), and tumor necrosis factor superfamily 14 (Tnfsf14) were involved in inflammation. To illustrate the mechanism of SPs interfering with inflammation, take the significantly expressed genes (Lcn2, Tnfsf14, Cxcl1, S100a8 and S100a9) as an example. Lcn2 controls the expression of LCN2 and is positively correlated with inflammation (Labbus et al., 2013). Therefore, the down-regulation of Lcn2 alleviated the inflammatory response by alcohol-induced. Decreased Tnfsf14 participates in the reduced expression of TNFSF14, a soluble inflammatory cytokine, and belonging to the TNF superfamily of pro-inflammatory molecules (Doherty et al., 2011). IL-8 is an important proinflammatory cytokine, and exerts its biological effects through CXCR1 and CXCR2, whereas CXCR2 need binds CXCL1 (Visciano et al., 2015) Thus, the down-regulation of Cxcl1 was expected to indirectly decrease the expression of IL-8. Proinflammatory properties of S100A9 and S100A8 were reported, which can induce the production of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 (Foell et al., 2007). By down-regulating the expression of S100a8 and S100a9, reducing the release of pro-inflammatory factors, thereby alleviating inflammation. In general, the preintervention of SPs regulated related genes, directly or indirectly reduced inflammatory factors, to alleviate the inflammation by alcohol-induced. The genes 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase V (Hsd3b5), Lcn2, and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (Socs3) interfere with lipid metabolism. It has been reported that Hsd3b5 was negatively associated with hepatic steatosis (Guillen et al., 2009). So, increased Hsd3b5 could positively control fat accumulation in the liver. LCN2 as a key regulator of PPAR-γ activation, can affect adipogenesis and lipogenesis in the liver (Jin et al., 2011). By the down-regulating of Lcn2, could inhibit fat synthesis. Decreased Socs3 could inhibit the expression of SOCS-3, a protein that improves insulin sensitivity, thereby ameliorates liver steatosis (Dali-Youcef et al., 2013). The intervention of oxidation involved the glutathione S-transferase M1 (Gstm1) and Lcn2 genes. GSTM1 belongs to the superfamily of glutathione s-transferase enzymes and plays a vital role in protecting cells against endogenous and exogenous oxidative stress (Hayes et al., 2005). By up-regulating Gstm1, the ability to resist oxidative stress was enhanced. Over-expression of LCN2 not only affects inflammation and lipid metabolism, but also aggravates oxidative stress as well (Alwahsh et al., 2014). Therefore, decreased Lcn2 could reduce oxidative stress damage by alcohol-induced in mice. Although the SPs can regulate lipid metabolism disorders and oxidative stress damage by alcohol-induced, the main mechanism was to mediate inflammation. The above transcriptomics results analyzed the DEGs in liver for alcohol-induced under SPs pretreatment. Combined with the measuring biochemical indices (Fig. 3), we hypothesized the possible regulation mechanism of SPs preintervention (Fig. 6 ). In summary, our results suggested that there are three aspects may be involved in the mechanism of SPs, including inflammation response, lipid metabolism and oxidative stress, of which inflammation response is the major aspect."
22,Conclusion,"In conclusion, the SPs prepared from soybean meal displayed superior antioxidant activities both in vitro and in vivo. In a mice model of acute alcohol-induced liver injury, preintervention of SPs mediated dose-dependent improvements in biochemical indices and liver histopathology associated with alcohol-induced liver injury were demonstrated. In addition, SPs was no toxic effects on Caco-2 cells and kidneys. Moreover, a large number of DEGs were identified based on transcriptome analysis, and most of these genes were related to inflammation, lipid metabolism and oxidation. Our results support the fact that SPs have excellent potential for functional food or dietary supplementation to protect against alcohol-induced liver injury."
