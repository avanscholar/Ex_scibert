0,Introduction,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a small lipophilic molecule and colorless, toxic, and flammable gas with an unpleasant smell like that of rotten eggs (Fotopoulos et al., 2015). It inhibits mitochondrial respiration by impairing cytochrome C oxidase. However, H2S now emerges as the third important gas messenger and signaling molecule after nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO). Breakthrough in the research came when H2S endogenously cross cell membranes without receptors, and thus like NO and CO, H2S appeared as a novel gasotransmitter involved in signal transduction (Guo et al., 2016). H2S is found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In animals, endogenous H2S functions as a neuromodulator in brain cells (Jin and Pei, 2015). Recently, it was found that H2S is produced in plants under normal and stressful conditions, and modulates plant growth and developmental processes. Therefore, it is important in sustaining agriculture and improving crop production (Hancock and Whiteman, 2014; Pandey and Gautam, 2020). H2S plays a widespread potent role in seed germination, photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, root organogenesis, transpiration, and ultimately senescence under normal and stress condition (Li et al., 2014a, 2014b; Chen et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020b). It also has a major role in increasing the shelf life of extensive fruits and vegetables during post-harvesting. The favorable effects in plants are seen at lower doses of H2S, whereas higher concentration impairs growth and developmental processes (Ni et al., 2016). Rennenberg et al. (1987) firstly investigated that H2S is produced in plant sub-cellular compartments like cytosol, chloroplast, and mitochondria. For H2S production, L/D-cysteine is catalyzed by L/D-cysteine desulfhydrase. It was discovered and characterized that specific cysteine desulfhydrase exhibit H2S biosynthesis and sulfur assimilation (Fotopoulos et al., 2015). H2S biosynthesis takes place in chloroplast, mitochondria, and cytosol with the help of five enzymatic systems, i.e., L-cysteine desulfhydrase (L-CDes), D-cysteine desulfhydrase (D-CDes), β-cyanoalanine synthase (CAS), cysteine synthase (CS), and sulfite reductase (SiR) (Li, 2015). H2S signaling is generally mediated by post-translational modification on cysteine residues on the particular target protein site in a process called persulfidation (Paul and Snyder, 2015). A diversity of approaches to delivering H2S in plants, such as applying sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) and sodium sulfide (Na2S), gives just little burst of H2S.Nevertheless, donors (e.g., GYY4137, AP97, AP105) that give H2S to a great extent, and target organelles are available (Hancock and Whiteman, 2014). The current review focuses on the multifaceted safeguarding role of H2S in plant tolerance to different environmental stresses and its interaction with reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidants, and osmoprotectant. Moreover, this review also highlights H2S post-translational modifications, the crosstalk of H2S with phytohormones and other signaling molecules, as well as H2S biosynthesis in subcellular compartments and the enzymes involved in this process."
1,Biosynthesis of H2S,
2,H2S biosynthesis in different subcellular compartments,"2.1 H2S biosynthesis in different subcellular compartments Hydrogen sulfide production occurs in various subcellular compartments like chloroplast, mitochondria, and cytosol via cysteine production and metabolism (Fig. 1 ). Majorly H2S is produced inside chloroplast during photosynthetic sulfate assimilation processes, where sulfite reductase reduces sulfite (SO3 2-) to sulfide (S2-). It was reported during the estimation of metabolite content that the highest amount of H2S is found in plastids (García et al., 2015). Cysteine synthesis via O-acetyl serine (thiol) lyase (OASTL) is the final step of photosynthetic sulfate assimilation processes. Several types of OASTL are present in cytosol, chloroplast, and mitochondria that synthesize a vast amount of cysteine, but the main reservoir of cysteine is cytosol; it has more than about 300 μM cysteine. Additionally, mitochondria and chloroplast have less concentration (10 μM) (García et al., 2015; Gotor et al., 2019). The cytosol is the reservoir of metabolically generated H2S from cysteine. There are various forms of cysteine degrading enzymes like L-cysteine desulfhydrase (L-CDES), which catalyzes the conversion of L-cysteine to S2-, ammonia, and pyruvate. Furthermore, some plants have D-cysteine desulfhydrase (D-CDES), which specifically catalyzes the conversion of D-cysteine. NifS-like enzymes participate in the desulfurization of cysteine. They convert cysteine into alanine and sulfur to S2-. Additionally, these proteins are involved in producing molybdenum cofactors, biosynthesis of biotin, thiamin, and Fe-S cluster (Gotor et al., 2019). Mitochondria also synthesize H2S via enzyme β-cyanoalanine synthase (CAS) during cyanide detoxification (Fig. 1). This H2S is assimilated by mitochondrial isoform OASTL, which synthesizes cysteine. This amino acid is again utilized in the CAS pathway to detoxify cyanide. Thus, it creates a cyclic pathway inside mitochondria (Álvarez et al., 2012). Additionally, if excess H2S accumulate inside mitochondria like chloroplast, then active mitochondrial cell raises pH (basic), and H2S is converted to hydrosulfide ion (HS−) and thus, it cannot pass through the mitochondrial membrane and maintains H2S homeostasis. Furthermore, it was reported that during environmental cues, the endogenous level of H2S increases that also induces the activity of H2S-generating desulfhydrases (Gotor et al., 2019)."
3,Enzymes involved in H2S biosynthesis,"2.2 Enzymes involved in H2S biosynthesis In H2S biosynthesis, five enzymatic systems take part (Fig. 1). Among them, L-cysteine desulfhydrase (L-CDes) is the major enzyme that participates in H2S production. L-CDes (EC 4.4.1.1) is present inside the chloroplast. Using pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor, they mediate the conversion of L-cysteine into pyruvate and produce H2S. In Arabidopsis thaliana, L-CDes is involved in maintaining L-cysteine homeostasis (Li, 2015). Additionally, in A. thaliana under environmental stresses, ABA expresses the L-cysteine desulfhydrase1 (DES1) gene, which codes of enzyme L-CDes inside guard cells (Scuffi et al., 2014). L-CDes activity also induces several abiotic stresses for endogenous synthesis of H2S. A. thaliana mutant that shows reduced expression of LCD (gene encoding for L-CDes), shows decreased content of H2S. D-CDes (EC 4.4.1.15) degrades D-cysteine. D-CDes and L-CDes both have similar functions but have different physiological properties. Furthermore, DCD1 (a D-CDes gene) enhances H2S content during heavy-metal and salt stress (da-Silva et al., 2018). Mitochondrial CAS (EC 4.4.1.9) is involved in the synthesis of H2S and maintains the level of cyanide (the inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration) during ethylene synthesis. Cysteine synthase (CS) (EC 4.2.99.8), found in the cytosol, chloroplast, and mitochondria, participates in converting reversible reaction involved between L-cysteine and acetate into H2S and O-acetyl-L-serine. During salt stress, CAS and CS activities provided a higher accumulation of H2S in leaves. Inside the chloroplast, in the presence of sulfite reductase (SiR, ferredoxin) (EC 1.8.7.1), reduces sulfite (SO3 2-) to S2 −. All these enzymes participate in H2S synthesis under normal and environmental cues and provide plant sustenance (Li, 2015; da-Silva et al., 2018)."
4,H2S – a crucial player in the physiology and biochemistry of plants,
5,Seed germination,"3.1 Seed germination Germination is a highly crucial process where dry seeds get imbibed with water, then seed dormancy break and radicle emerges out. The exogenous application of H2S in low doses enhances germination and seedling growth in many plants (Alamri et al., 2020) (Fig. 2 ). H2S, HS− or NaHS (a sulfur-containing compound derived from H2S donor) promote germination by enhancing amylase activity and reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content (Jin and Pei, 2015; Khan et al., 2017). H2S application in a dose-dependent manner enhances seed germination, seedling growth, leaf growth, biomass, and photosynthetic traits in several plant species such as Phaseolus vulgaris, Pisum sativum and Zea mays (Dooley et al., 2013). In Jatropha curcas, the treatment of H2S plays a key role in increasing germination percentage and helps in plant sustenance (Li et al., 2012). Zhang et al. (2010d) reported that pre-treated wheat seeds with H2S mitigated osmotic stress (PEG-6000) and chromium stress, it enhanced germination traits, amylase, and esterase enzyme activity; it also induced antioxidant system and reduced MDA and ROS amount. In A. thaliana, low doses of NaHS enhanced germination traits; this facilitation in germination is due to the promotive effect of enzymes which produce H2S in plants such as L-cysteine desulfhydrase, D-cysteine desulfhydrase, and β-cyanoalanine synthase; contrary to this, high doses of NaHS inhibited seed germination and does not alleviate seed dormancy (Baudouin et al., 2016). In Vigna radiata, H2S treatment increased H2O2 (downstream signaling molecule of H2S) content, protease activity, and amino acid content, which further enhanced the germination trait. H2S supplementation enhanced germination rate, seedling length, and fresh weight. It also increases antioxidant potential in germination seedling, which scavenges ROS and improved germination tolerance against heavy metal stress, and promoted amylase and esterase activity responsible in germination. It increased catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POX), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity, which further reduced the content of MDA, ROS, and lipoxygenase; it also helped in maintaining membrane integrity (Huang et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2018)."
6,Growth and development,"3.2 Growth and development Hydrogen sulfide in low concentrations shows growth-promoting effects. Furthermore, higher concentrations of H2S are toxic to plants metabolic processes, and plant starts to show inhibitory effect on physio-biochemical processes, i.e., drastically lowers down plant metabolic rate, delays flowering, and causes senescence (Fig. 2). It can enhance embryo root length and promote protein synthesis. Application of NaHS on cucumber seedlings under salt stress enhances shoot length, root length, shoot biomass, root biomass, and leaf area. H2S supplementation improves growth, biomass, and developmental processes, such as germination, maturation, flowering, senescence, and fruit ripening (Corpas, 2019). Furthermore, it also improves yield attributes, which induces sustainable agriculture (Corpas, 2019; Jiang et al., 2019; Pandey and Gautam, 2020). Sulfate deficiency in Brassica oleracea enhanced the sulfate influx in roots via sulfate transporters. However, prolonged deficiency leads to altered shoot-root partitioning and utilization of atmospheric H2S (Chen et al., 2018). H2S supplementation on Glycine max increased biomass, nodule number, leaf nitrogen (N) absorption, and N content; additionally, it also modulated grain number and yield parameters. H2S can improve mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, chloroplast, and mitochondria structure (Ali et al., 2014). In Festuca arundinacea seedlings, H2S supplementation increased plant growth and developmental metabolism under low light stress. Furthermore, it enhanced plant height, biomass, leaf width, number of tillers, turf quality, and photosynthetic activity (Liu et al., 2019)."
7,Photosynthesis,"3.3 Photosynthesis Hydrogen sulfide plays a significant role in increasing photosynthesis by promoting ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) activity and inducing photosynthetic electron transport via thiol redox modification, and it also enhances chlorophyll biosynthesis (Ye et al., 2020) (Fig. 2). In several plants, e.g., cucumber and rice, H2S application modulates photosynthetic traits such as Fv/Fm ratio, electron transport rate, chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate (Mostofa et al., 2015; Jiang et al., 2019) (Fig. 2). NaHS application promoted photosynthesis, stomatal opening, chlorophyll content, photochemical efficiency of PSII, and grana lamellae stacking. It further improved carboxylation efficiency and light saturation point (Li et al., 2015; Jiang et al., 2019). In addition, H2S treatment enhanced RuBisCO activity and up-regulation of several genes such as RuBisCO large subunit (RBCL), small subunit (RBCS), ferredoxin, ferredoxin thioredoxin reductase, thioredoxin, acetyl serine (thiol) lyase, and NADP malate dehydrogenase, but cytochrome oxidase was down-regulated (Li, 2013; Jiang et al., 2019). Therefore, H2S in low doses (100 μM) plays a vital role in improving photosynthesis under stress and non-stress conditions by increasing photosynthetic traits, up-regulation of genes, and thiol modifications (Li, 2013). Furthermore, H2S plays a pivotal role in enhancing the synthesis of chlorophylls and carotenoids and down-regulating photorespiration by reducing glycolate oxidase activity, CO2 compensation point, and photosynthetic oxygen sensitivity (Duan et al., 2014; da-Silva et al., 2017). H2S modulated photosynthetic parameters in low light-stressed F. arundinacea seedling. It improved photosynthetic machinery by up-regulating chlorophyll content, stomatal movement, transpiration rate, inter CO2 concentration, photochemical quenching, PSII efficiency, electron transport system, and photosynthetic enzyme activity (Liu et al., 2019)."
8,Water relation and stomatal conductance,"3.4 Water relation and stomatal conductance Hydrogen sulfide plays a crucial role in the modulation of stomata and plant water relations. However, the interaction between H2S and secondary messengers, like H2O2 and calcium ion (Ca2+) participates in stomatal movement and regulating plant water relations, leaf turgor, osmotic potential, and transpiration rate. Two different and opposite theories exist about H2S participation in stomatal conductance. One of them suggests that H2S enhances stomatal conductance. NO increases the ABA level in cells, but its content can be reduced by applying H2S and its donors. Furthermore, H2S negatively affects H2O2 concentration and increases guard cell activity, and promotes stomatal opening and conductance. The second theory suggests that H2S promotes stomatal closure and reduces stomatal aperture via ATP-binding cassette transporter located on guard cell and through ethylene mediated pathway (Duan et al., 2014). In A. thaliana, H2S, together with (p-methoxyphenyl) morpholino-phosphinodithioic acid (GYY4137), plays a significant role in stomatal opening, apparently by reducing NO and ABA levels (Li, 2013). García-Mata and Lamattina (2010) found that H2S participates in stomatal closure via ABC transporters located on the guard cells. Moreover, H2S causes modulation in potassium ion (K+) channels that leads to micro RNA synthesis and NO formation, which causes ABA-mediated stomatal closure. DES1/H2S participates in ABA-mediated stomatal closure and controls water loss (Zhang et al., 2020a). Furthermore, persulfidation based modifications of SnRK2.6, DES1, and NADPH oxidase respiratory burst oxidase homolog protein D (RBOHD) controls ABA signaling inside guard cell (Chen et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2020)."
9,Senescence and post-harvest,"3.5 Senescence and post-harvest Senescence is tightly regulated by several genes and enzymes that cause the death of certain organs, a specific part or the whole organism (Zhang et al., 2020b). However, the application of H2S diminished senescence in several fruits and vegetables by improving antioxidant enzymatic machinery (Ni et al., 2016) and accumulation of metabolites such as ascorbate, anthocyanin, and carotenoids. Senescence is mainly induced by ethylene and enzymes, which convert S-adenosyl methionine to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and ACC to ethylene. Ethylene plays a crucial role in affecting post-harvest traits of fruits and vegetables by modulating ripening and increasing senescence. However, the H2S application reduced ethylene level by reducing the transcription of genes involved in ethylene and ACC production (Zheng et al., 2016). H2S serves as antioxidants that delay senescence (including post-harvest senescence) in several flowers, as well as non-climacteric and climacteric fruits (Al Ubeed et al., 2019). H2S mitigated senescence, post-harvest decay, and fungal attack by increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes and decreasing MDA content, as well as polyphenol oxidase and lipoxygenase (LOX) activity. H2S modulated expression of senescence-associated genes and also increased DES1 activity (Zhang et al., 2020b). H2S supplementation showed beneficial results on grapes, and it delayed post-harvest rachis browning, fruit rotting, and threshing. Further, it also postponed chlorophyll degradation and carotenoid storage in rachis and pulp. In addition, it enhanced fruit weight, titratable acidity, firmness, and soluble solid amount during post-harvest storage (Ni et al., 2016). Furthermore, H2S promotes shelf life by increasing fruit firmness and decreasing fruit rot index, respiration rate, and poly galacturonase activity. In addition, the activities of CAT, POX, SOD, and GR and the content of reducing sugar and protein were enhanced (Fotopoulos et al., 2015). NaHS application confers post-harvest decay tolerance in day lily flower by enhancing endogenous H2S production and maintaining its homeostasis and compartmentalization. It also induced an antioxidant system that decreased ROS and maintained internal energy (Liu et al., 2017)."
10,Role of H2S in abiotic stress tolerance,"The desirable concentration of H2S has been found amazingly useful in combating several environmental challenges (Fig. 2). In the following subchapters, an attempt is made to explore the involvement of H2S in the regulation of defense mechanisms under stressful conditions."
11,Salinity stress,"4.1 Salinity stress Salinity stress is one of the most toxic abiotic stresses that affect sustainable agriculture to a great extent. It impairs plant growth and development and also halts important physio-biochemical processes (e.g., photosynthesis). Salinity destabilizes ion homeostasis and compartmentalization, leading to ionic stress. Furthermore, it increases the production of ROS and causes oxidative stress. Therefore, salinity is wrath to plant to germination, growth, and development and yield attributes (da-Silva et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2019). In alfalfa seed, the H2S application combated salinity stress by increasing germination traits. Furthermore, it enhanced gene expression and production of enzymes such as CAT, POX, SOD, and APX, which reduced ROS production and lipid peroxidation; H2S supplementation also improved ion homeostasis and compartmentalization. Thus, this helps combat stress and proper seed germination (Wang et al., 2012). The endogenous level of H2S and NO caused depletion in salt stress by activating the antioxidant enzymatic system and improving non-enzymatic content like glutathione, in tobacco (da-Silva et al., 2017). Under salt stress, application alleviated the deleterious effect of salt in cucumber by improving antioxidant enzymatic and non-enzymatic machinery, which reduced ROS content; it also improved photosynthetic parameters like PSII activity, photosynthetic rate, and chlorophyll content. Additionally, it also reduced sodium (Na+) ion uptake and improved potassium (K+) uptake (Jiang et al., 2019). Moreover, during saline soil conditions, H2S plays a crucial role in up-regulating the expression of several genes such as PM H+-ATPase, SKO, and SOS1, which induces ion homeostasis and compartmentalization and diminishes the toxic effect of salinity. In hydroponics, pre-treatment of strawberry roots with NaHS confers salt tolerance by enhancing photosynthesis, relative water content, and chlorophyll fluorescence. Besides, quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that NaHS priming enhanced gene expression of antioxidants such as APX, CAT, SOD, and GR, hence induced the synthesis of ascorbate and glutathione (Jiang et al., 2019). Furthermore, transcription factor (TF) DREB and SOS (salt overly sensitive) pathway genes such as SOS2, SOS3, and SOS4 were modulated; therefore, it suggests that H2S is a potent signaling gas molecule that functions in a coordinated manner for the regulation of TF for mitigating salt stress (Christou et al., 2013). H2S application counteracted the deleterious effect of oxidative and ionic stress caused by salinity by increasing wheat grain germination and improving antioxidant machinery (Ye et al., 2015). H2S plays a key role in up-regulating the expression of H + -ATPase, Na + /H + antiporter, SOS2, SOS3, and SOS4 genes on exposure to salinity, which maintains a low level of Na+ and high level of K+; this restrains the Na+/K+ ratio by maintaining ion homeostasis and plasma membrane integrity (Pandey and Gautam, 2020). Furthermore, its treatment also reduced Na+ concentration, Na+/K+ ratio, and improved K+ uptake by inducing selective transportation capacity of K+ over Na+(Deng et al., 2015). The treatment of H2Sunder high salinity controls the MDA, LOX, ROS, and RNS by improving antioxidant enzymes, enhancing osmolyte production, cellular ion homeostasis, and compartmentalization and sodium ion cell extrusion. It also combated a decrease in ratios of GSH/GSSG and AsA/DHA under salinity. H2S significantly deceased MDA, ROS, and electrolyte leakage; and thus reduced salt-induced oxidative and ionic damage (Ye et al., 2015)."
12,Drought stress,"4.2 Drought stress Exogenous application of NaHS on Glycine max increased the growth, biomass, and physiological processes than without H2S control under continuous drought stress. In addition, it induces the activity of CAT and SOD, which reduce ROS, LOX, and MDA. Apparently, it attenuated oxidative damage and drought stress (Zhang et al., 2010b). LCD participates in degrading cysteine to produce H2S. In A. thaliana, H2S modulates stomatal conductance and movement to diminish drought conditions. It was reported that the LCD mutant decreased the expression of several ion-channels like Ca2+ and outward-rectifying K+ channels. In contrast, the expression of inward-rectifying K+ channels and several other anion channels increased and thus increased stomatal movement, which leads to plant sensitivity to drought. However, the application of H2S reversed all the gene expression of channels and helped in stomatal closure via the help of ABA; H2S increased transmembrane efflux of K+, Ca2+, and Cl−. Therefore, H2S, in coordination with ABA, ion fluxes, and ion channels, counteracted the toxic effect of drought stress (Jin et al., 2017). During drought conditions, ABA plays a crucial role in the expression of DES1 that promotes H2S production and facilitates stomatal closure via HY1 signaling pathway (Zhang et al., 2020a). Furthermore, H2S regulates guard cell ABA signaling by rapid signal integration mechanism involving specific and reversible persulfidation based modifications of DES1 and SnRK2.6 that occur in response to stress conditions (Chen et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2020). In wheat, H2S plays a key role in combating drought partially by the ABA signaling pathway (Ma et al., 2016). In Spinacia oleracea, drought stress reduced relative water content, photosynthesis, and enhanced ROS and MDA production. However, supplementation of H2S culminates plant tolerance to drought by modulating metabolic and biochemical traits and also by increasing the production of osmolytes such as proline, GB, sugars, sugar alcohols, and PA, which induce leaf water content and osmotic potential. H2S up-regulate expression of several genes such as betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH), aquaporin (PIP1, 2), choline monooxygenase (CMO), and PA biosynthesis, which provide plant tolerance against drought (Chen et al., 2016). H2S makes the resistance by increasing expression of genes RD29A, DREB2A, DREB2B, and CBF4. Moreover, it induces the expression of miRNA like miR167, miR393, miR396, and miR398, which attenuates A. thaliana tolerance to drought (Zhao et al., 2007). The beneficial role of H2S in tolerance of Eruca sativa (arugula) to dehydration stress was reported with H2S mediated induction in osmolyte content, activation of enzymatic antioxidant defense machinery, carbonic anhydrase activity, and enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of Cys (OAS-TL), which reduced ROS and maintained membrane permeability. Moreover, H2S increased DCD and LCD enzymes that synthesized more H2S and improved the efficiency of the plant to ameliorate water scarcity stress-induced alterations (Khan et al., 2018). H2S in an appropriate dose on wheat protects against oxidative damage produced by drought by inducing growth, biomass, RWC, chlorophyll, CAT, SOD, photosynthesis, and PSII efficiency; whereas it reduced content of TBARS, MDA, and ROS. Furthermore, it was evaluated upon NaHS treatment, up-regulation of several D1 proteins (located on PSII) related genes such as STN8 (D1 protein phosphorylation), and genes related to D1 protein degradation, like FtsH2, FtsH5, Deg1, Deg5, and Deg8. Thus, H2S combated PSII damage induced by drought by increasing D1 protein turnover rather than inducing accumulation of D1 protein (Li et al., 2015). NaHS treatment alleviated PEG induced drought stress by improving translocation of iron from root to shoots and by inducing KEGG metabolic pathway of biogenesis of ribosome, protein processing of endoplasmic reticulum, degradation of fatty acid, and metabolism of cyano amino acid. Furthermore, H2S also participates in the signal transduction pathway of phytohormones, protein kinase, and TFs involved in drought-tolerance (Li et al., 2017)."
13,Heavy metal stress,"4.3 Heavy metal stress 4.3.1 Cadmium stress Cadmium (Cd) is non-essential and highly toxic HMs that pollutes soil and inhibits plant growth, metabolism, and development. Plants growing in Cd contaminated soil deteriorate plant biochemical and yield attributes; it enhances ROS and disturbs antioxidant machinery. Under Cd stress, H2S supplementation on wheat seeds enhanced germination trait, seedling length, amino acid content, and antioxidant enzymes (APX, CAT, and POX) activity. Moreover, it reduced the contents of H2O2, superoxide, MDA, and lipoxygenase, thus make plant Cd tolerant (Huang et al., 2016). In bermuda grass, the H2S application attenuated the deleterious effect of Cd by increasing enzymatic antioxidants; and also by improving non-enzymatic antioxidants, e.g., GSH. Additionally, it decreased MDA, LOX, electrolyte leakage, and ROS content; therefore, maintained membrane integrity and protect cells from metal damage (Shi et al., 2014). Excessive Cd in soil showed devastating effects on rice. It reduced the effect of oxidative stress, an antioxidant enzyme, and non-enzymatic antioxidant. Further, it increased MDA, ROS, and methylglyoxal (MG). However, H2S supplementation conferred the toxic effect of Cd by reversing all the toxic symptoms. H2S increased growth, biomass, mineral uptake, RWC, photosynthesis, and total soluble protein content. It also improved plant redox status by increasing MG detoxifying enzymes, antioxidant enzymatic, and non-enzymatic machinery, and by decreasing ROS content (Mostofa et al., 2015). Furthermore, H2S treatment exacerbated alterations promoted by Cd, it modulated proline content and also increased transcription and activity of the proline-5-carboxylate reductase and proline dehydrogenase (Tian et al., 2016). In Populus euphratica, a low concentration of H2S (25 μM) helped in detoxifying Cd stress by scavenging ROS via the help of CAT, APX, and GR. Furthermore, NaHS treatment also inhibited Cd-induced programmed cell death. Additionally, it reduced the content of Cd in the cytoplasm, whereas enhanced Cd influx inside the vacuole; however, Cd transport also depends on the tonoplast pH gradient. H2S inhibits Cd transportation inside plasma membrane calcium channels, which are activated by H2O2. It also improved the sequestration of Cd via activation of Cd2+/H+ antiporters located on tonoplast. Thus, NaHS participates in Cd homeostasis and compartmentalization. Contrary to this, the H2S application in higher doses (200 μM) reversed all positive responses in plants (Sun et al., 2013). H2S and NO in combination mitigated the deleterious effect of Cd and provide wheat tolerance. It induced synthesis of chlorophylls, increased antioxidant defense machinery, enhanced fresh and dry weight, and also increased uptake of mineral nutrients (Kaya et al., 2020). The genes related to H2S production (LCD, DCD1 and DES1) were up-regulated during Cd stress which suggests that endogenous H2S increased the Cd stress tolerance (Luo et al., 2020). H2S also ameliorate Cd stress by increasing the expression of calcium dependent protein kinase (CDPKs), metal tolerance protein (MTP1/12), iron-regulated transporter like protein and CA2+/H+ exchanger antiporter (CAX2). H2S act as signaling molecule that interacts with NO, SA and JA to induce Cd stress tolerance (Luo et al., 2020). 4.3.2 Aluminum stress Aluminum (Al) in the form of ions (Al3+) is highly toxic as it impairs plant growth and development. The primary cause of Al toxicity in plants is the production of ROS beyond a threshold, which disturbs antioxidant homeostasis and cause damage to membrane and cell organelles. Thus, Al toxicity enhances ROS production and lipid peroxidation, which negatively affects plant growth and development. However pretreatment of seedlings with NaHS in several essential crops such as barley and oilseed rape alleviate the Al toxicity by reducing the accumulation of Al ions and ROS and by increasing the activity of antioxidant enzyme which protects the several cellular structures (Luo et al., 2020). Appropriate dose application of H2S reported to be beneficial in alleviating the toxic effect of Al stress in wheat. Supplementation of NaHS (H2S donor) promoted enhanced endogenous content of H2S, which combated Al stress. Furthermore, it reduced ROS production by improving SOD, CAT, POX, and APX activities. Additionally, it also reduced MDA content in root and enhanced plant growth and development, and help in improving Al tolerance (Zhang et al., 2010c). In soybean, H2S interacts with NO and helps combat Al stress by increasing H+-ATPase-coupled citrate transporter (GmMATE13 and GmMATE47). Moreover, H2S enhances Al resistance by increasing root elongation, mineral uptake, and other important physio-biochemical processes (Wang et al., 2019). The pretreatment of rice seed with NaHS ameliorate the toxic effect of Al by reducing the contents of pectin and hemicelluloses and the activity of pectin methyl esterase which help to decrease the negative charge in cell walls. Furthermore, this treatment up-regulate the several genes like OsSTAR (sensitive to aluminum rhizo toxicity) and OsFRDL4 (ferric reductase defective-like 4) which reduce the Al binding in the cell wall and improve the resistance to Al stress (Luo et al., 2020). 4.3.3 Copper stress Copper (Cu) stress impairs plant growth and development, and it also damages plant cells. Additionally, Cu enhances the production of ROS, MDA, and H2O2, which further leads to oxidative stress (Shan et al., 2012). In wheat seedlings, NaHS treatment improves the resistance to Cu stress by increasing the growth, biomass and reducing the ROS, which further modulate the lipid structure and photosynthetic machinery (Luo et al., 2020). However, application of H2S in low doses reduced the harmful effect of Cu stress and enhanced wheat seed tolerance; it induced the activity of antioxidant enzymes like SOD, CAT, and APX, which scavenges ROS and help in proper growth and development of wheat seedling during stress (Zhang et al., 2008). NaHS application conferred tolerance to Cu stress in plants by reducing MDA, ROS, and electrolyte leakage. Moreover, improved activity of DHAR, GR, and γ-ECS; also enhanced the content of AsA and GSH. Thus, this induced plant growth, metabolism, and biochemical activity (Shan et al., 2012). NaHS treatment also increase the activity of enzymes participated in the AsA- GSH cycle, like APX, GR, MDHAR, DHAR L-galactono-1 and 4-lactone dehydrogenase. These observations further suggest that H2S plays a potent role in maintaining the redox balance and increase the plant tolerance against Cu stress (Luo et al., 2020). 4.3.4 Chromium stress Chromium (Cr) stress is the hazardous chemical released in soil via tanning, steel, and textile industries. A high amount of Cr in the soil leads to chlorosis, necrosis, and ATP deformation; furthermore, it causes accumulation of ROS in plant cells, which further causes membrane to disintegrate, DNA, and RNA damage that impairs replication, transcription, and translation processes. Wheat seeds pre-treated with H2S helped to alleviate the toxic effect of Cr by enhancing germination trait and activity of enzymes involved in germination. Furthermore, H2S also decreased ROS and MDA content by improving antioxidant enzyme machinery. Furthermore, it was also found that H2S also plays a significant role in the transportation of reserve material in endosperm via the hydrolytic enzyme, which plays a key role in germination. Thus, it evaluates that H2S provides plant Cr tolerance (Zhang et al., 2010a). In barley and cauliflower, NaHS treatment effectively decreases the ROS and Cr accumulation in roots, shoots and leaves. Furthermore, the treatment also decreases the Cr toxicity by increasing the antioxidant system, protecting integrity of chloroplast and reducing the damage of nuclei in roots (Luo et al., 2020). Alamri et al. (2020) reported that NO-induced H2S biosynthesis conferred tolerance of tomato seedlings to Cr (VI). Moreover, NO and H2S both in association increased glutathione pool, glycine betaine, total phenol, and carbohydrate content, which help in reducing Cr induced oxidative stress and improving photosynthetic traits. Furthermore, under Cr toxicity, the inclusion of hypotaurine (H2S scavenger) or cPTIO (NO scavenger) decreased H2S levels, Cys and glutathione homeostasis, and S-assimilation, which resulted in poor immunity against oxidative stress induced by Cr(VI) toxicity. Thus, suggesting that NO is associated with internal H2S production in attenuating stress (Alamri et al., 2020). Metallotheioneins (MTs) and phytochelatins (PCs) are two important proteins for plant to tolerate heavy metal stress. H2S alleviate the Cr stress by increasing the accumulation of MTs and PCs and also regulate the expression of MT2A, PC1 and PC2. H2S also plays a chief role in increasing the GSH concentration by up-regulating the expression of GR and glutamyl cysteine synthase (GSH1) and also by recycling NADPH metabolism, activating antioxidant enzyme (Luo et al., 2020). 4.3.5 Lead stress Lead (Pb) stress is a ubiquitous heavy metal pollutant that hampers germination, photosynthesis, respiration, root elongation, morphological traits, and yield attributes (Amooaghaie et al., 2017). However, exogenous application of H2S ameliorated the toxic effect of Pb on cauliflower by increasing antioxidant enzymatic machinery, which reduced ROS and MDA. Further, it enhanced germination traits like germination rate, seedling biomass, growth, and development. Moreover, H2S enhanced the content of thiols and glutathione, which chelate Pb and remove toxic Pb from plant cells. H2S exerts a well-documented influence on the antioxidant enzyme machinery. Supplementation of cotton with NaHS the H2S donor confers Pb stress tolerance by increasing growth, photosynthetic machinery, chlorophyll content, and SPAD value. In addition, it reduced electrolyte leakage, MDA, and ROS content by enhancing antioxidant defense machinery and protein content. H2S treatment reduced Pb translocation from root to shoot and diminished content of Pb in the root, shoots, and leaves (Chen et al., 2018). In Sesamum indicum, H2S and NO both synergistically confer increased tolerance to Pb stress via activating antioxidant systems that scavenge ROS and increases plant growth, chlorophyll, and carotenoid content, as well as PSII efficiency, and photosynthesis. In particular, Pb translocation and uptake was reduced via H2S inclusion and also harmonized the balance of mineral nutrient (Amooaghaie et al., 2017). In Brassica napus, H2S alleviate the Pb stress by reducing the absorption and accumulation of Pb, improving the photosynthetic machinery and by decreasing the ultrastructural damages. Furthermore, H2S also improves the absorption of macro and micro nutrients and reduce the ROS and MDA contents by activating the antioxidant system and AsA-GSH cycle (Luo et al., 2020)."
14,Heat stress,"4.4 Heat stress H2S application in low concentration promotes heat tolerance in wheat seedling, it positively regulates growth and development, as well as enhances total sugar content and CAT, SOD, and APX activity and reduces MDA and ROS amount (Yang et al., 2016). In maize, NaHS participates in the acquisition of heat stress tolerance. It increases photosynthetic machinery and is involved in plant sustenance. Furthermore, H2S significantly enhances GB content by inducing the activity of betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH). In contrast, by supplying hypotaurine (H2S scavenger) and disulfiram (BADH inhibitor), all the positive responses were hampered (Li and Zhu, 2015). Li et al. (2014b) reported that H2S application on Zea mays provides heat tolerance; it improved seedling survival percentage and further promoted the activity of CAT, POX, SOD, GPX, APX, and content of GSH and AsA. Additionally, it induced ratios of antioxidants to total antioxidants like AsA/(AsA + DHA) and GSH/(GSH + GSSG). Exogenous H2S application on maize ameliorates oxidative damage, reduces electrolyte leakage, and improves thermo tolerance by modulating the antioxidant system (APX, CAT, SOD, GPX, GR, MDHAR, ascorbic acid, glutathione, and flavonoid), up-regulating gene expression and increasing soluble sugar, trehalose and osmolyte (proline, glycine betaine) content under heat stress (Ye et al., 2020). In Nicotiana tabacum, ABA application enhances the endogenous level of H2S by increasing the activity of L-cysteine desulfhydrase and attenuates the deleterious effect of heat and improved tobacco heat tolerance. Thus, H2S is partially involved in ABA-induced heat tolerance (Li and Jin, 2016)."
15,Cold stress,"4.5 Cold stress Chilling impairs plant growth and development. It negatively affects a series of morho-physiological, biochemical attributes; further, it alters calcium signaling, membrane structures, and signal transduction pathway. Like other stresses, it also produces a large amount of ROS, RNS, and MDA (Liu et al., 2018). Fu et al. (2013) found that NaHS mitigated low-temperature stress in grape Vitis vinifera. It was evaluated that the H2S application reduces the content of MDA and superoxide radicals. It induced the activity of SOD and improved membrane permeability. H2S acts as the potent signaling molecule that maintains the membrane integrity of the plasma membrane and modulates metabolic processes. Furthermore, H2S supplementation up-regulated expression of TF likes C-repeat-binding factor (CBF3) and inducers of CBF expression (ICE1), which confers plant tolerance to low-temperature stress. In A. thaliana, H2S activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway that culminates in cold stress tolerance. The MAPK, along with H2S, up-regulate the several cold-tolerance responsive genes such as ICE1, CBF3, cold-responsive 15A (COR15A), and COR15B. H2S halts stomatal opening and conductance via MAPK4. Thus, MAPK4 acts downstream for H2S related cold resistance (Du et al., 2017). In banana fruit, NaHS application (0.5 mM) inhibited chilling injury by inhibiting ethylene, MDA, and electrolyte leakage. Additionally, it induced the energy status of fruit and promoted the activity of H+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase, cytochrome C oxidase (CCO), and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). Thus, H2S attenuated cold stress and improved fruit tolerance (Li et al., 2016). H2S and IAA together combated chilling stress and provided tolerance in cucumber. IAA acts downstream of H2S mediated chilling tolerance in cucumber (Zhang et al., 2020). Table 1 illustrates the proper mechanism of action of H2S operating in combating several abiotic stresses in different plant species."
16,Interaction of H2S with phytohormones,"H2S is the novel gasotransmitter and active signaling molecule that can interact with several phytohormones and other signaling molecules (Table 2 ). Furthermore, there are multiple pathways of H2S signaling and perception to be unraveled. Phytohormones (e.g., auxin, ABA, ethylene, jasmonates, gibberellins, and salicylic acid) interact with H2S conferring stress tolerance (He et al., 2019). Indole acetic acid (IAA) is majorly synthesized in meristematic cells and seeds. After the H2S application, IAA content increased that further induced plant height and morphological traits (He et al., 2019). In sweet potato, H2S treatment induced the formation of the adventitious root, which is mediated by auxin and NO increase. Furthermore, root organogenesis, which was promoted by H2S, was mitigated after the application of IAA transporter inhibitor and NO scavenger, i.e., N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO), respectively. Additionally, NaHS treatment-induced root organogenesis mediated by IAA in Glycine max seedling and Salix matsudana (Zhang et al., 2009). In tomato, IAA caused improvement in H2S content, which induced lateral root production (Fang et al., 2014). Additionally, H2S performs its signaling by acting downstream of IAA, mediating lateral root formation (Li et al., 2014a). The application of H2S on A. thaliana inhibits the auxin transportation by modulating PIN protein distribution, which leads to alteration in root development. However, H2S not only does contribute to root growth and development that is auxin-induced, but also plays a significant role in modulating the root patterning (Jia et al., 2015). Gibberellic acid (GA) is present in immature seeds and promotes germination and fruit development. H2S and GA together perform the same function that breaks seed dormancy and induces seed germination (He et al., 2019). In wheat, pre-treatment of H2S enhanced germination attributes by inducing activity of amylase and GA in the endosperm (Zhang et al., 2010c). GA promoted programmed cell death (PCD) by reducing LCD activity and H2S production. NaHS application combated GA-induced PCD in seeds. H2S and GA mutually play a vital role in seed germination (Xie et al., 2014). H2S application after interacting with ABA attenuated the stress, and it enhanced transmembrane efflux of K+, Ca2+, and Cl−. Furthermore, H2S and ABA caused stomata closure and modulated ion fluxes and ion channels (Jin et al., 2017). In A. thaliana, ABA plays an important role in activating DES1 gene expression in guard cells which helps in H2S production. Moreover, H2S biosynthesis regulates ABA-dependent stomatal closure through long hypocotyl1 (HY1) signaling pathway (Zhang et al., 2020a). Furthermore, ABA stimulates the persulfidation of SnRK2.6 and DES1 at Cys44 and Cys205 in a redox-dependent manner (Chen et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2020). In wheat, H2S helps in alleviating drought partially by ABA signaling. It also increased the biosynthesis of ABA in the leaves and an improved transcription of the genes encoding for ABA receptors (Ma et al., 2016). H2S supplementation increases the activity of L-cysteine desulfhydrase, which acts upstream of NO and causes modulation of ABA-mediated stomatal closure. Additionally, in A. thaliana, the protein phosphatase 2C mutant ABA-insensitive (abi1-1) does not cause stomatal closure when cells were treated with H2S. Therefore, this concludes that H2S needs functional ABI1 (Scuffi et al., 2014). Ethylene (ET) is synthesized in several parts of the plant. It slowdowns growth but promotes flowering, fruit ripening, and leaf senescence. Exogenous application of ET increased the content of LCD or DCD activity and enhanced H2S production in guard cells and thus induced stomatal closure. Additionally, H2S scavengers blocked stomatal closure ET-triggered. Furthermore, ET plays a significant role in age-associated signaling (He et al., 2019). Jasmonic acid (JA) and its methyl derivative inhibit germination, growth, development, promote senescence, and provide plant immunity against biotic stress. JA responses are promoted by the downstream activity of JASMONATE ZIM-domain (JAZ), which further activates TFs (Ruan et al., 2019). In Vicia faba guard cells, JA supplementation induced activity of LCD or DCD, further promoting H2S content. Additionally, H2S participates in JA-triggered stomatal closure. It confirmed that H2S decreased the stomatal closure induced significantly by JA. However, the role of JA with H2S interaction is still unclear (Zhihui et al., 2011). SA and H2S show close interactions and shows positive results when applied together in plants. Combined treatment of SA and NaHS can attenuate heat stress and provide stress tolerance by synergistically inducing germination, growth, and biochemical traits, as well as improve antioxidant activity, e.g., SOD, APX, and CAT. In A. thaliana, SA supplementation increased LCD activity, hence improved H2S biosynthesis. This conferred Cd stress and improved plant tolerance. SA and H2S induced synergistically alleviated stress by improving antioxidant machinery and increasing plant morpho-physiological attributes. WRKY used in SA signaling reduced H2S production by down-regulating LCD expression, this enhanced plant sensitivity to heavy metal stress (Liu et al., 2015)."
17,Crosstalk of H2S with other gasotransmitter and signaling molecules,"H2S plays a significant role in the signaling pathways of another plant gasotransmitter, i.e., NO, CO, calcium ions, MG, and H2O2 (Jin and Pei, 2015) (Table 2). In bermuda grass, combined treatment of H2S/NaHS and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) positively regulated plant metabolism during stress. It also blocked the negative role of H2S inhibitors and scavengers. Therefore, NO-triggered H2S was essential for alleviating Cd stress (Shi et al., 2014). In Ipomea batatas, NaHS application promoted the endogenous biosynthesis of H2S and NO, which resulted in the induction of morphological and growth parameters. The same results were evaluated in willow and soybean, where both NO and H2S promoted organogenesis. Thus, H2S acts upstream of NO and triggers adventitious-root formation (Zhang et al., 2009). It was found that there is an inter-connection between signaling of NO, H2S, and Ca2+, which help in lateral root formation. Additionally, the application of H2S inhibited the promotive effect of NO on Ca2+ production, which further inhibited the calmodulin 1 gene (CaM1) expression. Thus, H2S acts as a regulatory switch between signaling of NO and Ca2+ (Fotopoulos et al., 2015). The H2S and NO crosstalk show relationships with each other through PTM on cysteine that are S-sulfhydration and S-nitrosylation (Guo et al., 2016). In ET dependent stomatal closure, H2S shows a response downstream of NO (Liu et al., 2012). Contrary to this, H2S acted upstream of NO to modify ABA-induced stomatal closure (Scuffi et al., 2014). Cumulatively H2S and NO attenuated oxidative stress and improved salt tolerance in alfalfa (Wang et al., 2012). The H2S acted as a multi-faced transducer and signaling molecule which further improved NO-triggered hypoxia tolerance in maize (Peng et al., 2016). In wheat seedling, PEG induced drought stress was alleviated by the application of NO, which increases the activity of OAS-TL enzyme. It further induces the production of Cys and H2S and induced production of the enzymatic antioxidant defense system and accumulation of compatible osmolyte. Thus, it can be concluded that NO is associated with endogenous H2S, helping in facilitating the defense system and mitigating stress (Khan et al., 2017). Furthermore, in tomato seedlings, exogenous NO increased the level of endogenous sulfur assimilation, Cys and H2S biosynthesis, and metabolism. It also helped in reducing oxidative stress produced by Cr toxicity and further boosted up plant immune for better growth and development (Alamri et al., 2020). Crosstalk and relationship between H2S and NO improved plant physio-biochemical traits under environmental cues and improved plant sustenance and tolerance (Hancock and Whiteman, 2018). H2S crosstalk with calcium is also a novel signaling pathway. Ca2+ maintains cell wall structure and modulates plant developmental processes via calmodulin. In tobacco, NaHS and Ca2+ provide heat tolerance in plants. NaHS improved the entry of Ca2+ inside the cell, mediated by the secondary signaling molecule calmodulin. Under several environmental stresses, plants synthesize aldehyde like MG, which in higher concentrations is toxic. However, MG and H2S participated in attenuating heat stress and providing plant tolerance. MG also induces LCD activity and plays a significant role in H2S production. Moreover, MG modulates the expression of protein kinases (Pandey and Gautam, 2020). H2S and MG both synergistically improved heat tolerance in maize by increasing enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant machinery, proline, and glycine betaine content (Ye et al., 2020). H2O2 plays an important role during environmental stress, especially in guard cells. H2S and H2O2 both are produced in large quantities during stress, and both are compartmentalized. However, it is further needed to explore the signaling of two molecules. It is reported that in Vicia faba, H2S is the downstream molecule of the H2O2 signaling pathway during JA-triggered stomatal movement (Zhihui et al., 2011). H2S acts as a mediator in promoting the germination rate in Jatropha curcas when H2O2is applied. In contrast, the H2S application inhibited the Cd uptake via negatively regulating plasma membrane calcium channels in Populus cells, which were activated by signaling molecule H2O2(Sun et al., 2013). H2S negatively affects H2O2 concentration and increases guard cell activity, and promotes stomatal opening and conductance (Duan et al., 2014). H2S plays a key role in mitigating stress by decreasing H2O2 content, which maintains membrane stability and protein structure (Khan et al., 2018)."
18,Mode of H2S action,"H2S signaling is generally mediated by post-translational modification (PTM) of Cys residues on the particular target protein site in processes (Bari and Olabe, 2016): 1. Persulfidations (S-sulfhydrations): P-SH + HS2 − ↔ P-SSH + HS−, where P = protein 2. S-sulfenylations: P-OH + [O] ↔ P-SOH, where [O] = H2O2, alkyl hydroperoxides, orperoxynitrite P-SOH + HS− ↔ P-SSH + OH− 3. S-nitrosations: HSNO + HS− ↔ HS2 − + HNO 4. S-nitrosopersulfidations: R-S(H)NO + HS2 − ↔ R-SSNO- + HS− + H+ 5. S-transnitrosations: RSNO + R’S− ↔ RS− + R’SNO NO forms -SNO groups by attacking cysteine, whereas H2S targets -SH group of cysteine protein and converts to produce persulfides (SSH). H2S cannot modify cysteine residue directly, so it generates persulfides after reacting with disulfides and oxidized thiols. Sulfhydration can occur in various ways, such as by nucleophilic attack on the oxidized cysteine residues by sulfide; by the reactions taking place between the oxidized sulfide forms like cysteine thiols and disulfides, and by the reaction between H2S and cysteine thiols. Persulfidation modification induces the reactivity of protein cysteine, while nitrosylation reduces cysteine reactivity. It mostly takes place on cysteine residues at low acid dissociation constant (pKa); however, some modifications take place at high pKa (Paul and Snyder, 2015; Bari and Olabe, 2016; Zhang et al., 2017). Persulfidation modification is highly important as it protects reactive cysteine residues from irreversible toxic oxidation and yields persulfide groups. The oxidation product of persulfides such as perthiosulfinic (CySSO2H) and perthiosulfonic (CySSO3H) are recycled back by further S-S moieties reduction. It was reported that H2S persulfidation of cysteine-35 of NF-κB (p65 subunit) modulated protein activities in accordance with structural and functional attributes (Pandey and Gautam, 2020). Moreover, ROS and RNS also change protein activity via H2S persulfidation. Thus, sulfhydration or persulfidation emerges to be the novel PTM elicited by H2S (Pandey and Gautam, 2020). Persulfidation based PTM of DES1, SnRK2.6, and NADPH oxidase RBOHD control ABA-mediated guard cell signaling, which plays an important role in providing plant stress tolerance and boosting up plant immunity for proper growth and development (Chen et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2020). We assume that H2S, which is part of the plant sulfur metabolism, is a new signal molecule whose regulatory function acts through redox interactions, especially the protein PTMs (persulfidation). The application of exogenous H2S, involving a signaling cascade, causes association with plant hormones and signaling molecules, which leads to the activation antioxidant system at both the gene and protein level. All these together contribute to decrease in ROS and electrolyte leakage, and modulations in plant physiological and biochemical processes, which provide plant tolerance to several abiotic stresses. However, the proper mechanism of H2S action is still unclear."
19,Conclusions and future prospective,"Hydrogen sulfide being a gasotransmitter and signaling molecule, plays an exceedingly significant role in enhancing numerous functions in plants. Nevertheless, it still endured an enigmatic gas. Moreover, it is becoming manifested that H2S is emerging as an essential gaseous transmitter and signaling molecule in facilitating plant physio-biochemical and molecular responses by modulating several associated signaling pathways during the healthy and stressful environment. The current review gives us a better understanding of characteristics associated with several sulfur-containing compounds as well as the H2S donors like NaHS, Na2S, and GYY4137 on important physiological and biochemical processes. Furthermore, it induces and improves several processes such as seed germination, vegetative growth, organogenesis, reproductive growth, yield, and senescence in normal and different environmental stress. Additionally, H2S modulates photosynthetic traits such as Fv/Fm ratio, electron transport rate, chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate, stomatal opening/closing, and transpiration rate under several environmental conditions. Moreover, the H2S application modulates morpho-physiological and biochemical traits and improves crop production and yield attributes. It also improves the post-harvesting of fruits and vegetables under normal and abiotic stress circumstances. The current review highlighted the H2S production and homeostasis in different sub-cellular compartments such as chloroplast, cytosol, and mitochondria. It also briefly highlighted five enzymatic systems, i.e., L-CDes, D-CDes, CAS, CS, and SiR, which play a chief role in H2S biosynthesis. H2S signaling is generally mediated by PTMs taking place on cysteine residues on the particular target protein site in a process called sulfhydration and persulfidation; H2S targets -SH group of cysteine protein and converts to produce persulfides or -SSH. The interaction between H2S and phytohormones such as auxins, gibberellins, ethylene, ABA, ethylene, jasmonic acid, and SA is modulating several physiological and developmental processes during stress conditions. Nevertheless, the biochemical and molecular mechanisms of H2S involved in increasing physio-biochemical attributes and antioxidant machinery need to be further investigated. We hypothesize that H2S is hugely beneficial for the growth and metabolism of plants. The data on physio-biochemical and molecular responses of plant tolerance to environmental stresses seem crucial in designing a new type of plant that would be more efficient in dealing with global climatic modifications. Moreover, unraveling the role of H2S in modulating hormone associated signaling pathways in detail will be essential to develop a deeper understanding of hormonal modulations of plant metabolic and signaling cascade. In the present scenario, current knowledge on possible mechanisms operating in conferring H2S mediated abiotic stress tolerance and genes controlling plant metabolism would require further intensive research. H2S signaling and biotechnological approaches applied to mitigate stress and to improve plant tolerance also need to be studied. The role of H2S in modulating genes associated with phytohormones in improving plant growth and developmental processes should be in the scope of future studies. The H2S crosstalk with phytohormones and interplay between signaling molecules need to be fully understood. In the current scenario, available investigations on H2S biosynthesis, signaling, and PTMs are too distant from being thorough and would need additional intensive research. Indisputably, a vast area for future research remains."
