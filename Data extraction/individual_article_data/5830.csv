0,Introduction,"Graphene has received tremendous interest in recent years, owing to its remarkable chemical, mechanical, and electronic properties, and its great potential in applications, including integrated circuits, active materials in lithium secondary batteries, transparent conductive electrodes for solar cells, biological and chemical sensors, and polymer composites [1,2]. Current methods to prepare graphene sheets and graphene-like materials include the micromechanical exfoliation of graphite [3], chemical vapour deposition [4], epitaxial growth [5], and the reduction of graphene oxide (GO) [6–8]. Although well-defined graphene can be produced using the first three methods, their low productivity make them unsuitable for mass production. The most promising and economically viable approach for the large-scale production of graphene-based materials is the chemical reduction route, in which cheap graphite powder is first oxidized using strong oxidants to produce exfoliated GO, followed by the graphitization of the GO to reduced graphene oxide (RGO) using various chemical routes. In the oxidation step, the sp2-bonded carbon network is modified with oxygen functionalities (e.g., hydroxyl, epoxy, carbonyl, carboxyl groups), and a variety of defects/holes form, resulting in a significant degradation of the graphene properties. Therefore, developing an effective method that can remove the oxygen functionalities and restore the unique hexagonal graphene structure is crucial for the reduction method. In addition to the ability of deoxygenation and graphitization, an ideal reduction method should be reliable, simple, cost-effective, easy to scale-up, and environmentally safe for the successful use of graphene in industry. The most commonly used method for the chemical reduction of GO has been performed with strong reducing agents such as hydrazine [7,9–11], sodium borohydride [12], and sodium borohydride, followed by concentrated sulfuric acid at elevated temperature [13], and hydriodic acid with acetic acid [8]. Effective removal of the oxygen functionalities (the carbon-to-oxygen ratio of RGO ranges from 8 to 15) and high electronic conductivity (5000–30,400Sm−1 prior to annealing) were achieved using strong reducing agents (see Table S1). However, these reducing agents are highly toxic, explosive, carcinogenic, and expensive, which makes them unattractive for use in large-scale production. To date, considerable efforts have been made to search for alternative, ‘green’ reduction methods. This includes the use of relatively less toxic or non-toxic reducing agents, such as strongly alkaline solutions (KOH/NaOH) [6], l-ascorbic acid [14,15], sugar [16], tannic acid [17], iron powder [18], ethylenediamine [19], protein [20], green tea [21], hydrothermal dehydration [22], solvothermal reduction [23,24], and γ-ray reduction [25]. The key issue of green methods is that the deoxygenation reaction has been less active when compared to the methods based on strong reducing agents, and thus, the CC π-conjugation of graphene sheet could not be restored effectively in some cases. As a result, the as-synthesized RGO has often exhibited a lower carbon-to-oxygen ratio and poorer electronic conductivity compared to the RGO obtained using strong reducing agents. Additionally, some of the green methods require relatively lengthy reaction times (a few hours to a few days), and generate a large qunatity of waste organic solvents or water, which will be a serious problem in commercial implementation. Therefore, no chemical reduction methods are currently operated for the large-scale produciton of RGO. Recently, supercritical fluids have received much attention in a variety of research fields, including nanomaterial synthesis [26,27], waste water treatment [28], biomass liquefaction and gasification [29], microelectronics [30], thin-film coating or deposition [31,32], particle formation [33], and material recycling [34] owing to their beneficial physical properties, including extremly low viscosity, high diffusivity, zero surface tension, and environmental benignity. Supercritical alcohols retain very unique properties that are quite different from the most popular supercritical fluids such as supercritical carbon dioxide and supercritical water. Supercritical alcohols can donate hydrogen in the form of molecular hydrogen, hydride, or protons. The hydrogen donation mechanisms in supercritical alcohol reported in the literature are shown in Fig. 1 [35,36]. The first mechanism is the initial donation of α-hydrogen in hydride form, and the formation of an electron-deficient hydroxylalkylation species [35]. The second mechanism, resembling the Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley (MPV) reduction, is alkoxide ion and proton formation, followed by α-hydrogen donation in hydride form and aldehyde formation [36]. The hydrogen donation ability of supercritical alcohols has been used in the hydrogenation of double bonds in organic compounds [35], the synthesis of metal nanoparticles [37–39], and the reduction of aldehydes and ketones to their corresponding alcohols by MPV reduction mechanism [40–42]. Supercritical alcohols can participate in the reaction as hydroxyalkylation, alkylation, and alkoxylation agents, depending on the substrates. For example, the generation of the active hydroxylalkylation species (e.g., +C(CH3)HOH, in Fig. 1) can react with unsaturated hydrocarbons, yielding hydroxylalkylation products [35]. Pyrrole and indole rings can be methylated using supercritical methanol by the formation of H2C+–OH electrophile [43]. The hydroxyl group on CeO2 and ZnO nanoparticles can be modified with alkoxyl groups in supercritical alcohols [44–46]. Recently, we demonstrated that GO can be reduced in supercritical methanol (scMeOH) without using external reducing agents [47]. The key features of the supercritical alcohol route are that it is non-toxic, simple, cheap, and very fast (requiring only a few seconds to a few hours), and produces effective graphitization. RGO nanosheets synthesized in scMeOH exhibited high carbon-to-oxygen ratio and electrical conductivity values of 11.89 and 10,600Sm−1, respectively, which are comparable to those produced with hydrazine-based methods. In addition, we demonstrated that the supercritical alcohol route is applicable to the large-scale production of RGO using a continuous-flow-type reactor. A very short reaction time of ∼17s can produce RGO with a carbon-to-oxygen ratio of 5.36. However, the deoxygenation mechanism and the effect of various supercritical alcohols on the properties of RGO have not been fully understood. Our goal in this study is to evaluate different supercritical alcohols for reducing GO, and to understand the deoxygenation mechanism of GO in supercritical alcohol. The supercritical alcohols used in this study include supercritical methanol (T c =239°C, P c =8.1MPa), supercritical ethanol (scEtOH, T c =241°C, P c =6.1MPa), supercritical 1-propanol (scPrOH, T c =264°C, P c =5.2MPa), supercritical 2-propanol (scIPA, T c =235°C, P c =4.8MPa), and supercritical 1-butanol (scBuOH, T c =290°C, P c =4.4MPa). Since different alcohols at their supercritical state have different reactivity (e.g., hydroxylakylation) as well as different hydrogen donating ability, the RGOs produced using different supercritical alcohols would exhibit different physicochemical properties. We demonstrate that RGOs produced in different supercritical alcohols retain very different carbon-to-oxygen ratios, structures, and textual properties. In addition, we characterize the gas- and liquid-phase products using various analytical methods, and propose a deoxygenation mechanism for GO in scEtOH."
1,Experimental,
2,RGO synthesis,"2.1 RGO synthesis GO was prepared using the modified Hummers method [48,49]. A detailed description of the experimental procedure for GO synthesis is given in the Supplementary data. The current experimental setup can produce ca. 17g of GO using 12g of natural flake graphite in each batch reaction. For the GO reduction in supercritical alcohols, 1g of GO was dispersed in 8ml of each alcohol using a vortex mixer. The mixed suspension was sonicated for 1h in a 20-mL glass vial. Then, 3.5mL of the mixed suspension was introduced into a SUS 316 reactor with an inner volume of 11ml. After being tightly sealed, the reactor was immersed into a molten salt bath (salt weight ratio of KNO3:NaNO3:Ca(NO3)2 =46:24:30) and reacted for 2h at 400°C. At this condition, approximately 3wt.% of ethanol was decomposed to gas product. After the reaction, the reactor was taken out from the salt bath and quenched in a cold water bath. After the cooling, the produced RGO suspension was rinsed and filtered through a FP Vericel® poly(vinylidene fluoride) membrane filter. Wet RGO powder was dried in a vacuum oven at 70°C overnight, and sieved using a mesh size of 75μm. The RGOs synthesized using the different supercritical alcohols were designated as RGO-scMeOH, RGO-scEtOH, RGO-scPrOH, RGO-scBuOH, and RGO-scIPA."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The functional groups on the surface of the samples were characterized using a NICOLET iS10 Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer (Thermo Electron Co. NJ, USA). The structure of the samples was characterized using a Nicolet Almega XR dispersive Raman spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., MA, USA) equipped with an Nd:YAG laser. The phase structure of the samples was analyzed using a D/Max-2500V/PC Rigaku X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Tokyo, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation at 40kV and 50mA. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on the samples using a PHI 5000 Versa Probe spectrometer (ULVAC-PHI Inc., Kanagawa, Japan). The XRD, Raman and XPS measurements were repeated at least three times and the averages quantification values estimated from the measurements were reported. Standard deviation was used to describe the uncertainties in the measurements. In graphs, the standard deviations are shown as error bars. The morphology of the samples was observed using a Hitachi S-4100 field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Tokyo, Japan) and a Tecnai-G2 high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM, FEI Co. Ltd., OR, USA). For the HR-TEM measurements, the samples were dispersed in dimethylformamide using ultrasonication, and dropped onto a copper grid with a perforated carbon film. The thermal properties of the samples were examined with a model Q500 thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA, TA instruments, DE, USA). The temperature was ramped up to 800°C at a rate of 10°C/min under a flow of high-purity nitrogen (50ml/min). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was measured using a Belsorp-mini II apparatus (BEL Inc., Osaka, Japan). The bulk powder conductivity was measured using a four-point probe method. Briefly, a given quantity of powder (0.8–1.7g) was poured into a poly(ethylene) tube with an inner diameter of 5mm. The powder was manually compressed between four steel plungers that closely matched the tube’s inner diameter. A Maccor Series 4000 Battery Test System (Oklahoma, USA) was connected to the plungers and used to measure the DC resistance by a four-point probe method at room temperature."
4,Gas and liquid analysis,"2.3 Gas and liquid analysis To analyze the gas and liquid products after the supercritical alcohol reduction, a batch reactor equipped with a gas sampling port was used. The reactor schematic is shown in Fig. S1 (Supplementary data). The port was connected to a pressure transducer and a gas sampling trap. The details of the gas and liquid sampling procedure are given in the Supplementary data. The gas product was analyzed by a PerkinElmer Clarus 600 gas chromatograph (GC)-Model Arnel 1115PPC Refinery Gas Analyzer (RGA) (PerkinElmer, CT, USA) with two different detectors: a thermal conductivity detector and a flame ionization detector. The liquid product was analyzed by a GC Agilent 6890N (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA)/time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (TOF/MS) manufactured by LECO Pegasus III (LECO, St. Joseph, MI, USA). A detailed description of the RGA GC and the GC–TOF/MS was given in our previous papers [50,51]. The water content in the liquid product was analyzed by an AF8 Karl Fischer titrator (Orion Research Inc., Boston, MA, USA)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Temperature and pressure estimation in the batch reaction,"3.1 Temperature and pressure estimation in the batch reaction The temperature of the batch reactor increased rapidly to the temperature of the salt bath (400°C) within one minute of being immersed [38]. Thus, the temperature of the reduction reaction was much higher than the critical temperature of each alcohol (235–290°C). During the reduction reaction, some gases were generated as reaction by-products, which will be discussed in detail in Section 3.3. The pressure in each supercritical alcohol reduction was estimated using the Peng–Robinson equation of state with Mathias–Copeman expansion [52], and the results are listed in Table S2. The pressure of each alcohol at 400°C was much higher than the critical pressure of each alcohol (4.4–8.1MPa). To confirm the pressure of the reactor, the pressure of each supercritical alcohol was measured using the reactor setup shown in Fig. S1. 5ml of each alcohol was used to compensate for the dead volume associated with a pressure transducer and tubing. As shown in Table S1, the measured pressures were approximately three times larger than the critical pressures of alcohols. Thus, it can be considered that the reaction was conducted at the supercritical condition."
7,Characteristics of RGOs,"3.2 Characteristics of RGOs Fig. 2 a shows the FT-IR spectra of GO and RGOs produced in each supercritical alcohol. The presence of hydroxyl (ν-OH at 3380cm−1), carbonyl (ν-CO at 1730cm−1), epoxy (ν-C–O–C at 1220cm−1), and C–O groups (ν-C–O at 1050cm−1) indicates that the GO retained the oxygenated functional groups. After the supercritical alcohol reduction, the peaks associated with the oxygen functionalities disappeared, while the CC group (ν-CC at 1620cm−1) that normally originates from skeletal ring vibrations [53] is clearly visible in the spectra of RGOs. RGOs produced using the different supercritical alcohols exhibited similar FT-IR spectra. The thermal stabilities of pristine graphite, GO, and RGOs reduced in the different supercritical alcohols were analyzed using the TGA, and the results are shown in Fig. 2b. In the case of GO, the 8.7% weight loss up to 100°C can be attributed to the removal of water molecules absorbed on the GO surface. A significant weight loss of 53.1% at up to 300°C occurred due to the removal of the oxygen functionalities in the forms of CO and CO2. The total weight loss of GO at 800°C was 66.1wt.%. The RGOs showed much less weight loss of ca. 2wt.% at below 300°C, indicating that considerable amounts of water and oxygen functionalities were removed by the supercritical alcohol reduction. Only a marginal difference in the total weight losses at 800°C for RGOs produced using the different supercritical alcohols was observed (RGO-scMeOH: 12.7wt.%, RGO-scEtOH: 13.4wt.%, RGO-scPrOH: 11.8wt.%, RGO-scBuOH: 13.5wt.%, and RGO-scIPA: 13.8wt.%). The weight loss of RGOs produced using the supercritical alcohols is comparable to those produced using hydriodic acid with acetic acid [11], hydrazine [10], and sodium borohydride followed by concentrated sulfuric acid at 200°C [16] (11–13wt.%), and much lower than with the green methods [6,16,17,21,23,25] (>20wt.%). This clearly indicates that efficient deoxygenation can be achieved using the supercritical alcohol route. Fig. 3 shows the morphologies of RGOs produced in the supercritical alcohols observed using SEM and HR-TEM. It can be seen that RGOs obtained from different supercritical alcohols have very similar morphology. RGOs retained wrinkled paper-like morphology that was aggregated to some degree, and randomly folded, with a highly porous structure, as shown in the SEM images. The HR-TEM image of the RGOs revealed the existence of silk-like graphene sheets. The selected area electron diffraction patterns on the periphery of the RGO sheets showed graphitic crystalline structure with hexagonal symmetry, indicating that the supercritical alcohols successfully restore the graphite structure in RGOs. In contrast to the FT-IR, TGA, and morphology observation results, quite different XRD patterns of RGOs synthesized using different supercritical alcohols were observed, as shown in Fig. 4 a. The XRD patterns of pristine graphite, GO, and RGOs with 2θ in the range of 10–90° are shown in Fig. S2. The 2θ and interlayer spacing values obtained from the XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 4b and Table S3. The pristine graphite has a sharp, strong peak at 2θ =26.42°, which corresponds to the interlayer spacing of 0.337nm, while GO has a peak at 2θ =11.76° with a larger interlayer spacing of 0.752nm, owing to the presence of the oxygenated functional groups (Fig. S2). After the removal of the oxygen functionalities by the supercritical alcohol reduction, the XRD patterns of RGOs showed relatively broad peaks at 2θ values in the range of 23–25°, with interlayer spacing values of 0.358–0.381nm, depending on the types of supercritical alcohol used. The higher basal spacing of RGO than that of pristine graphite may be due to incomplete removal of the oxygen functionalities. A precise evaluation of the XRD patterns of RGO-scPrOH and RGO-scBuOH revealed that the peak at 23–25° consists of two peaks (which are referred to as PrOH1 and PrOH2 for RGO-scPrOH; BuOH1 and BuOH2 for RGO-scBuOH). The XRD patterns of RGO-scPrOH and RGO-scBuOH were deconvoluted into two peaks, and the results are plotted in Fig. S3. This clearly suggests that the RGO sheets synthesized using scPrOH and scBuOH retained at least two different interlayer spacings. Previously, multiple peaks in the XRD patterns of RGOs were observed when a considerable amount of the oxygenated functional groups in GO still remained in the RGO samples, and the position of the secondary peak was typically located near the peak position of GO [54,55]. However, the secondary peaks at the smaller 2θ position (PrOH2 and BuOH2) were placed near the peak position of RGOs. Furthermore, as discussed in the TGA section, the weight loss of RGO-scPrOH and RGO-scBuOH is quite similar to that of the other RGOs. This suggests that the remaining oxygen functionalities on RGOs produced using scPrOH and scBuOH are not responsible for the secondary peaks. The presence of two interlayer spacings implies that in addition to the removal of the oxygen functionalities, the carbon chain of scPrOH and scBuOH may attach to the surface of RGOs during the reduction. It is not clear what kinds of oxygen functionalities on GO participate in the reaction with scPrOH or scBuOH, but condensation reaction between the hydroxyl group in the alcohols and hydroxyl/carboxyl groups in GO may be responsible for the alcohol chain attachment. As described in the introduction section, similar surface modification of alkoxyl groups in supercritical alcohols on CeO2 and ZnO nanoparticles was observed during nanoparticle synthesis in supercritical alcohol [44–46]. The slightly larger d-spacing value of BuOH2 than that of PrOH2 may be due to the longer carbon chain of 1-butanol. A significant difference was observed in the carbon-to-oxygen ratios of RGOs produced using different supercritical alcohols. The XPS survey spectra of pristine graphite, GO, and RGOs are shown in Fig. S4. The XPS survey scan indicates that our GO and RGOs contained only carbon and oxygen species. The sulfur, manganese, and potassium that were used for the oxidation and exfoliation of graphite were not detected. The atomic ratios of carbon to oxygen (C1s/O1s) estimated from the XPS survey spectra are listed in Table 1 . The alcohols listed in order of C1s/O1s ratio in the RGOs are scEtOH>scPrOH>scIPA>scBuOH>scMeOH, suggesting that scEtOH exhibited the most efficient reduction capability when the same volumes of alcohol were used. The reduction ability of the supercritical alcohols for producing RGOs may be related to the inherent reduction power of each supercritical alcohol and the number of alcohol molecules presented in the reactor. As listed in Table 1, higher C1s/O1s ratios occurred at higher pressures of the supercritical alcohols. A larger amount of alcohol molecules in the supercritical state may permeate into the interlammellar structure of GO and more efficiently reduce GO. The exceptional behavior of scMeOH may have been due to its inherent low reduction power or lesser ability to donate hydrogen compared to the other supercritical alcohols [35,56]. As described in the introduction section, several green methods for reducing GO have been proposed as alternatives to the strong reducing-agent-based methods. The C1s/O1s ratio can serve as an indicator to compare the reduction efficiency of such methods. RGO-scEtOH exhibited a C1s/O1s ratio of 14.4, and RGOs synthesized using scPrOH, scBuOH, and scIPA exhibited C1s/O1s ratios in the range of 12.5–13.7. These values are higher than or comparable to those of RGOs produced using the other chemical reduction methods with hydrazine (8.8–12.5) [11,15], sodium borohydride (8.6) [12], hydrodic acid with acetic acid [8], the green chemical reduction methods (5.6–12.5) [15,17,22–24], microwave-assisted methods (2.75–10) [57–59], and thermal reduction method (12.4 at 1000°C in Ar/H2 flow) [11], indicating excellent deoxygenation ability of the supercritical alcohols. The high-resolution XPS C 1s spectra of GO and RGO-scEtOH are shown in Fig. 5 a,b, and the C 1s spectra of RGOs synthesized using scMeOH, scPrOH, scIPA, and scBuOH are shown in Fig. S5. The C 1s spectra of GO and RGOs were deconvoluted using seven types of carbon with different chemical environments [60]: sp2 graphitic carbon (284.5eV), sp3 carbon (285.5eV), C–OH (hydroxyl group, 286.0eV), C–O/epoxy (ether and epoxy group, 286.6eV), CO (carbonyl group, 287.6eV), OC–O (carboxyl group, 288.7eV), and π–π∗ shake-up (satellite from sp2 graphitic carbon, 289.9eV). The chemical oxidation of graphite using the modified Hummers method significantly decreased the peak area of the sp2 graphitic carbon and generated peaks associated with the oxygen functionalities (Fig. 5a). After the supercritical alcohol reduction, the peak area of the oxygen functionalities decreased, while that of sp2 graphitic carbon increased. The presence of a π–π∗ shake-up peak at ca. 289.9eV for the RGOs indicates the restoration of aromatic/conjugated structure after the reduction. In addition, the RGOs exhibited an sp3 carbon peak at 285.5eV, implying the formation of a C–C bond. The area% of the peaks in the C 1s spectra of GO and RGOs was quantified, and the results are shown in Fig. 5c,d and Table S4. The sp2 graphitic carbon of RGO-scEtOH exhibited a high value of 68.7 area%, while RGO-scMeOH exhibited a much lower value of 66.0 area%. The RGOs synthesized using scPrOH, scBuOH, and scIPA retained similar sp2 graphitic carbon area% of 66.7–66.8%. This may indicate that scEtOH is the most effective reducing agent for deoxygenating GO. The area% of the sp3 carbon peak slightly increased with increasing carbon number in the supercritical alcohols, which seems to be caused by the reaction between the alcohols and GO during the supercritical alcohol reduction. As shown in Fig. 5d and Table S4, the major compositions of the oxygen-containing functional groups in GO listed in the order of area% are C–O/epoxy (45.4 area%)>CO (7.48 area%)>OC–O (7.40 area%)>C–OH (2.89 area%). After the supercritical alcohol reduction, the area% of the C–O/epoxy group was decreased remarkably to 4.08–5.11%. The area% of carbonyl group decreased to 3.17%, and that of carboxyl group decreased to 1.15%. However, the area% of the hydroxyl group increased from 2.9% to ca. 7% after the supercritical alcohol reduction. The presence of hydroxyl group in the RGOs can also be observed in the high-resolution O 1s spectra, as shown in Fig. S6. This implies that the hydroxyl group is the most recalcitrant to the reduction in supercritical alcohols. A similar trend was observed in the RGO produced by the heat-treatment method [11]. As in the case of XPS analysis, the use of different supercritical alcohols resulted in quite different BET surface areas of RGOs (Table 1). The BET surface area of GO was only 7.9m2/g, indicating a low degree of exfoliation during the oxidation reaction. The un-exfoliated graphite structure was observed in the SEM image of GO (Fig. S7). After the supercritical reduction, the surface area of the RGO increased up to 203m2/g for RGO-scEtOH and 126m2/g for RGO-scIPA. The reduction of GO in the other supercritical alcohols resulted in a much lower surface area of 25–54m2/g compared to scEtOH and scIPA. The surface area of RGO is related to the exfoliation ability of given reduction methods or reduction agents, since the gas produced during the reduction exfoliates the interlamellar structure of GO [61,62]. The high reduction power of scEtOH may cause the formation of a larger amount of gases as the by-product, which enhances the exfoliation of RGO. Raman spectra were collected to characterize the degree of defect repair and the structure of carbon in RGOs synthesized using the different types of supercritical alcohols, as shown in Fig. S8. The band at 1591cm−1 is one of the E2g modes (or G band, C sp2), which is associated with a graphene structure. The band at 1338cm−1 is one of the D bands (C sp3), which is associated with the structural imperfection created by the attachment of the oxygen functionalities on the basal plane, or defects generated from grain boundaries and vacancies [63,64]. Typically, a small D/G band intensity ratio (I D/I G) is regarded as a signal of defect repair, which means the broken graphitic structure is restored by the deoxygenation. The Raman spectra of GO and the RGOs are shown in Fig. S8a, and the I D/I G values of GO and RGOs estimated from the raw intensity are shown in Fig. S8b. After the chemical exfoliation of graphite, a prominent D-band was observed, indicating a significant decrease in the size of the in-plane sp2 domains due to the extensive formation of oxygen functionalities. The Raman spectra of RGOs also contained both the G and D bands. The I D/I G ratio of GO was 1.11, and the I D/I G ratio of the RGOs increased up to 1.30 with increasing carbon number in the alcohols, except for the case of RGO-scIPA, which showed a lower I D/I G ratio of 0.99. This may suggest an increase in the average sp2 domains upon the reduction of GO using scIPA, while the other RGOs exhibited decreased the sp2 domains compared to those of GO. Since the D-band is also known to be influenced by factors other than point defects (e.g., ripples, wrinkles, corrugations, etc.) [65,66], the Raman spectra were deconvoluted by adding two more defect-originated bands for more detailed investigation. One is the D∗-band that originates from the sp3 orbital in disordered carbons, and the other is the D∗∗-band that originates from finite-size graphitic crystals or from C–H vibrations in carbon chains [66]. The deconvoluted Raman spectra are shown in Fig. 6 a, and the area% of each peak is plotted in Fig. 6b. The area% of the G-band in GO was 16.8%, which increased only for RGO-scEtOH (19.0%) and RGO-scIPA (18.1%). The use of other supercritical alcohols resulted in decreasing area% of the G-band to 14.8–16.1%. RGO-scMeOH, RGO-scPrOH, and RGO-scBuOH exhibited decreased area% of the D∗∗-band, but the area% of the D-band increased to ca. 60%. RGO-scIPA also exhibited increased area% in the G-band, but the area% of the D∗∗-band also increased to 21.8%. Thus, RGO-scEtOH retained a higher fraction of the G-band and a lower fraction of the D∗-band, implying that scEtOH exhibits a better ability for the restoration of the graphitic structure when compared to the other supercritical alcohols. The electrical conductivity of the RGO-scEtOH powders was measured, and the result is shown in Fig. S9. The electrical conductivity increased up to 27,500S/m with increasing volume fraction of the powders to 0.425. This result was 2.5 times higher than the electronic conductivity previously reported for RGO-scMeOH [47], which supports that scEtOH is an excellent reducing agent for producing RGO. Since the electronic conductivity values are influenced by many factors, such as the sample geometry, measurement conditions, and test equipment, we did not compare our electronic conductivity data with other values."
8,Proposed reduction mechanism,"3.3 Proposed reduction mechanism To gain insight into the reduction mechanism of GO in supercritical alcohols, we chose scEtOH for its superior reduction ability compared to the other supercritical alcohols. As a control experiment, 5ml of pure ethanol was introduced into the reactor, and the reactor temperature was increased to 400°C. After 1h, the reactor temperature decreased to room temperature, and gas and liquid samples were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 7 a, a substantial amount of H2 (41.7mol%) was produced from a blank run (in the absence of GO). The other major gases listed in order of the amount produced are CO∼CH4 >C2H4 >C2H6 >C3H8. The formation of C3H6 and CO2 is negligibly small. After the blank run using scEtOH, approximately 200mL gas was formed. This amount of gas was estimated to be 0.12g calculated from the gas composition and the ideal gas law. The liquid phase analysis shown in Fig. 7b revealed that CH3CHO formed during the blank run. The water content in the liquid phase increased from 6.25×10−4 to 0.8wt.%, as listed in Table 2 . As shown in Fig. 1, the increase in pressure and temperature above the critical point of ethanol resulted in the production of H2 and CH3CHO [36]. In addition to the reported mechanism, the decomposition of ethanol at 400°C may lead to the formation of C2H4 and C2H6 in the gas phase and water in the liquid phase, as shown in Fig. 8 . When GO was reduced in scEtOH, the gas and liquid product were very different from those of the blank run. As shown in Fig. 7a, the H2 content was much smaller, while the CO2 and C2H4 content were much larger compared to those of the blank run. The liquid phase contained ca. 8 times more water (6.7wt.%, Table 2) than that from the blank run, indicating a significant amount of water formed during the scEtOH reduction. In addition, the amount of CH3CHO increased, and a substantial amount of diethyl ether formed when GO was reduced in scEtOH, which was not observed in the blank run. The reduction chemistry of GO is made rather complex by the presence of different oxygen functionalities at different GO sites. Epoxy and hydroxyl groups are mainly located on the basal plane, and carbonyl, carboxyl, and esters are located at the edge and vacancy sites [67–69]. The effective removal of the oxygen functionalities of GO in supercritical alcohols can be attributed to the combination of thermal reduction and chemical reduction by the hydrogen donation from supercritical alcohols. As shown in Fig. S10, the heat treatment of GO at 400°C in the absence of supercritical alcohol can produce RGO with a C1s/O1s ratio of 10 using the current reactor system. This clearly indicates that some of the oxygenated functionalities can be removed by simple annealing. The desorption of CO2 from the epoxide group can be initiated at temperatures as low as ca. 80°C [70], and the thermal removal of carboxyl group, generating CO2 as a byproduct, can occur at temperatures of 100–150°C [10,71,72]. The presence of hydrogen gas in the thermal reduction can further enhance the removal of oxygen functionalities from GO [10,73]. In this sense, the hydrogen consumption and water/CO2 formation observed during the scEtOH reduction can be understood as a sign of deoxygenation of the GO by decarboxylation and hydrodeoxygenation routes. In addition to the thermal reduction, a plausible de-epoxidation mechanism with scEtOH is shown in Fig. 9 . In Route 1, the carbon of the epoxy ring is attacked by α-hydrogen and hydroxyl group produced from scEtOH according to Fig. 8, followed by proton addition and the restoration of π conjugation, forming a CH2 CH2 molecule and two water molecules as byproducts. In Route 2, the proton and ethoxy group generated by Fig. 1 attack the epoxy ring, followed by the formation of a water molecule, a CH3CHO molecule, and the deoxygenated product. In Route 3, one proton from scEtOH is transferred to the epoxy ring, generating hydroxyl functionalities and ethoxy group. The hydroxyl group and proton undergo dehydration to yield the corresponding olefins and a water molecule as the byproduct. The ethoxy group may react with CH 3 CH 2 + , which is produced by Fig. 8, yielding diethyl ether. The increased amount of ethylene in the gas phase and the substantial formation of diethyl ether in the liquid phase, as shown in Fig. 7, imply that Route 1 and Route 3 may be the dominant deoxygenation mechanism with scEtOH. The superior reduction power of scEtOH when compared to other supercritical alcohols can be due to its better ability to donate hydrogen when same volume of alcohols was used."
9,Conclusion,"An effective green method to produce RGO with supercritical alcohols has been reported. The influence of five different supercritical alcohols on the properties of RGOs was investigated. Although the FT-IR and TGA analyses exhibited that the RGOs produced using the different supercritical alcohols retained similar chemical species and thermal properties, the XPS, BET, and Raman analyses revealed that scEtOH is a superior solvent for reducing GO. RGO-scEtOH exhibited a higher C1s/O1s ratio of 14.4, a higher BET surface area of 203m2/g, and a higher G-band area% of 19.0 compared to the RGOs produced using the other supercritical alcohols. The deoxygenation of GO in supercritical alcohols proceeds through thermal and chemical routes. The liquid and gas product analysis after the scEtOH reduction revealed that the dominant chemical de-epoxidation routes are hydrogen donation followed by dehydration. This study allows for the understanding of the role of different supercritical alcohols in the synthesis of RGOs, which allows for the choice of solvents in this green approach for facilitating the use of graphene-based nanomaterials in large-scale applications."
