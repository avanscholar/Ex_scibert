0,Introduction,"In Taiwan, about 570,000tons of kitchen waste are collected per year by the local Environmental Protection Administration (EPA). Currently, this waste is recycled and sent mostly to the pig farms and compost plants, but this might accelerate the spread of infectious diseases (e.g., foot-and-mouth disease) and cause some serious odors during composting. In addition, due to high moisture levels, incineration is not a favored way to treat kitchen waste. For all of these reasons, it is thus desirable to develop a new method to treat kitchen wastes. It is well known that hydrogen is an ideal fuel due to its characteristics of high calorific value, zero emission of carbon dioxide, and versatile applications in industry. Hydrogen gas could be generated from water, fossil fuels, and biomass, and steam methane reforming from natural gas is the most commonly used technology to produce hydrogen. Of all the materials capable of being used for hydrogen production, biomass is the most promising one due to its carbon-neutral characteristic, and the net CO2 emissions could be considered as zero. However, there is still vigorous debate as to whether it is better to use biomass for food or as an energy source. Fortunately, using the waste fraction of these biomasses to generate hydrogen might be one way to avoid this issue. In addition, because biological hydrogenation can be conducted under normal pressure and temperature, it is considered as a less energy-intensive technology than the other hydrogen-producing methods. By using photosynthetic or fermentative microorganisms, this process could be suitable for energy production and the decomposition of organic pollutants (Das and Veziroglu, 2001). A number of studies have successfully demonstrated that hydrogen fermentation is feasible to treat waste materials, such as food processing wastewater (Ueno et al., 1996; Yu et al., 2002; Yang et al., 2007; Kim and Lee, 2010), household and municipal waste (Liu et al., 2006; Ueno et al., 2007; Li et al., 2008), and sewage sludge (Massanet-Nicolau et al., 2010). Furthermore, because Taiwan has very few fossil fuels of its own, with more than 98% of its fuel needs being imported, development of a waste digesting system to produce hydrogen is of considerable practical interest. This study continues our previous investigation (Li et al., 2008) that established a hydrogen-production fermentor treating kitchen waste at 35°C. In addition to evaluating the performance, this study particularly tried to uncover the correlation between volumetric loading rate (VLR) and specific hydrogen production rate ( r H 2 ) with a linear regression, and compared the results of this regression with other studies which employed wastewater/solid-wastes as substrates. Cloning sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) were also applied to better understand the variations in microbial population under different conditions."
1,Methods,
2,Reactor operation and the kitchen waste,"2.1 Reactor operation and the kitchen waste In this study, a 3-L kitchen-waste fermentor operated with a fill-and-draw process (defined as an intermittent-continuous stirred tank reactor, I-CSTR) was established to evaluate the efficiency of hydrogenation. The instrumentation, start-up procedure, and the seeding source of this reactor were all essentially the same as in our previous work (Li et al., 2008). In the present reactor, a high-speed agitation (i.e., 160rpm) and screw-type baffle were set to facilitate the mass transfer. Besides, instead of continuous feeding, fill-and-draw process could avoid slurry substrates clogged in the tube, and let the maintenance become convenient. The operating pH and the temperature of this fermentor were controlled at 5.5±0.1 and 35±1°C, respectively. During every fill-and-draw process within 15min, one fourth of the working volume (750mL) of the mixed liquid was first withdrawn from the fermentor, and the same volume of kitchen waste was subsequently fed in. The hydraulic retention time (HRT) was controlled as 4, 2, and 1.33days, and the fill-and-draw procedure was conducted as 1, 2, and 3 times per day, respectively (further details of the operational parameters are given in Table 1 ). The specific hydrogen/carbon dioxide production rate (r biogas), presented in Fig. 1 , was calculated by dividing the gas production by the time (i.e., 24, 12, and 8h in Stages 1, 2, and 3, respectively) in each feeding interval. The kitchen waste collected from Kaohsiung City by the EPA was further blended into sections with particle diameters less of 1mm and stored in a 4°C refrigerator without any sterilizing pretreatment. According to the analytical results of kitchen-waste composition, high concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (COD, 107gL−1) and volatile suspended solids (VSS, 42gL−1) in the kitchen waste represented an abundance of organic matter. Among all the organic matters, the carbohydrate comprises 15gL−1 of solid and 3gL−1 of soluble states; the total organic nitrogen comprises 2g-NL−1 of solid and 1g-NL−1 of soluble states, respectively. The results of the ammonia (100mg-NL−1), lactate (10gL−1), acetate (1gL−1), and low pH (4.2–4.8) also illustrate that it is difficult to maintain its freshness due to the hot and wet climate in Taiwan. In addition, the high concentration of oil and grease (12gL−1) is another distinguishing feature of this waste (Li et al., 2008)."
3,Analytical methods,"2.2 Analytical methods The composition of biogas in the headspace was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (China GC 8900, Taipei, Taiwan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A 2m stainless-steel column packed with Hayesep Q (60/80 mesh) was used for separation of chemical species. The operating temperatures of the injection port, the oven, and the detector were all set at 60°C. Argon was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 15mLmin−1. Concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were determined using an ion chromatograph (Dionex DX-120, California, USA) equipped with an anion IonPac ICE-ASI column, an AMMA-ICE II suppressor, and a conductivity detector. One millimolar heptaflourobatyic-acid solution was used as the eluent at a flow rate of 0.8mLmin−1. Five millimolar of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide was used as the regenerant which capable of regenerating the resins packed in the suppressor. The carbohydrate was analyzed using the phenol–sulfuric-acid method (Herbert et al., 1971). The pH, NH 4 + - N , oil and grease, COD, and VSS were measured according to Standard Methods (APHA, 1995)."
4,DNA extraction,"2.3 DNA extraction A modification of the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-based extraction method (Miller et al., 1999) was used to obtain genomic DNA from the microbes of I-CSTR. Approximately 1mL of mixed liquid was taken from I-CSTR and washed with Tris–EDTA buffer (10mM Tris–HCl and 1mM EDTA, pH 8.0) in a 2-mL sterilized test tube. Subsequently, 300μL of phosphate buffer (100mM NaH2PO4, pH 8) and 300μL of SDS reagent (100mM NaCl, 500mM Tris and 10% (w/v) SDS, pH 8) were used for cell lysing at 70°C for 5min. After the lysing process, the pellets were transferred into another test tube which contained 0.5g acid-washed glass beads (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) for physical breaking using a shaker agitated at 1600rpm for 5min. Finally, the DNA was extracted twice with an equal volume of a mixture of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and then precipitated using high purity ethanol. The extracted DNA was stored at −20°C for further use in terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and cloning sequencing."
5,Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP),"2.4 Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) For the T-RFLP analysis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was performed using the primer set of EUB0338 (5′-ACATCCTACGGGAGGC-3′) labeled with 6-carboxy-fluorescine (FAM) and a reverse primer 1392R (5′-ACGGGCGGTGTGTRC-3′). The thermal profile used for the amplification was as follows: a hotstart at 94°C for 5min, 30 cycles of denaturation (1min at 94°C), annealing (1min at 55°C) and extension (1.5min at 72°C), and a final extension at 72°C for 10min. The purified fluorescently labeled PCR products were digested using the restriction enzyme of MseI (New England Biolabs, MA, USA) for 3h at 37°C. For determining the size of each fragment, the digested PCR products were analyzed using gel electrophoresis in the Nucleic Acid Analysis and Synthesis Core Laboratory at the National Cheng Kung University in Tainan, Taiwan. The lengths of the terminal fragments were obtained by electrophoresis with an ABI Prism 377 automated sequencer (Perkin–Elmer Corp., MA, USA) for T-RFLP analysis."
6,16S rDNA cloning sequencing,"2.5 16S rDNA cloning sequencing For the 16S rRNA clone library analysis, a universal primer set including a forward primer 11F (5′-GTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′) and a reverse primer 1512R (5′-TACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′) was used to amplify an approximate 1500-bp fragment of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The thermal profile used for the amplification was as follows: a hotstart at 95°C for 1min, 30 cycles of denaturation (1.5min at 95°C), annealing (45s at 53°C) and extension (2min at 72°C), and a final extension at 72°C for 4min. The PCR products were inserted into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector and the ligation products were used to transform Escherichia coli DH5α competent cells using a commercial TOPO TA cloning kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). Plasmids of clones were extracted and purified using a Mini-M plasmid DNA extraction system (Viogene, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) pattern analyses for about 80 randomly selected clones, using the primer sets M13F (5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAG-3′) and M13R (5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3′) and restriction enzymes Hae III and Hha I, were performed to determine the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) numbers. The procedure of PCR reactions using the M13F–M13R sets was the same as the one using 11f-1512r sets. DNA sequencing reactions were performed for clones in each OTU using ABI 3100 and 3730 capillary sequencers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The sequences determined in this study have been deposited in the GenBank database under Accession Nos. EU998648 to EU998654."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Performance of I-CSTR and the strategy of shortening HRT,"3.1 Performance of I-CSTR and the strategy of shortening HRT The I-CSTR fermentor was operated for 252days and the entire procedure was divided into three stages based on different HRTs (Fig. 1). The detailed operating parameters are listed in Table 1. The maximum hydrogen production rate of 3.4L-H2 L−1 day−1 was observed in Stage 3 with the organic loading rate of 100g-CODL−1 day−1. When the organic loading rate was increased from Stage 1 to 3, the hydrogen production rate also increased from 0.7L-H2 L−1 day−1 to 3.4L-H2 L−1 day−1. However, the highest hydrogen yield ( Y H 2 ) of 96mL-H2 g−1 of VSS in the influent ( mL- H 2 g- VSS inf - 1 ) was observed in Stage 2 when the VLR was less than half that of Stage 3. In Stages 1 and 2, the acetate and butyrate production, and lactate consumption, did not change too much. However, in Stage 3, the amount of acetate production increased, whereas the butyrate decreased. In addition, a smaller amount of lactate degradation (6gL−1) was also found. Biogas production of all the feeding intervals was quite varied due to the alternation of the quality of kitchen waste. We chose three biogas profiles and plotted them with the relative amount of biogas production (in terms of %, as shown in Fig. 2 ). According to the results, the biogas production trends in all three stages were similar. The strategy of increasing VLR is used to shorten the hydrogen production procedure by constraining each feeding interval into an exponential phase. Unlike the method to calculate the r H 2 mentioned in Section 2.1, we tried to collect all the data and calculated their practical rates in the exponential phases, and the results were 2.5, 2.8, and 3.3L-H2 L−1 day−1 within Stages 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Although the values are not much different in all three stages, a slightly rising tendency of hydrogen production was still observed with increasing VLR. In addition, in Stage 1, even some hydrogen consumption could be observed after 10h in each feeding interval (Fig. 2). Due to the abundant organic nitrogen content in the kitchen waste (a total of 3gL−1), some ammonia could be produced after fermentation, and the consequently Stickland reaction might occur, leading to hydrogen consumption (Li et al., 2010). This inference corresponds well with the finding that the most ammonia was produced in Stage 1 with the lowest Y H 2 . The change in organic acid production/consumption might be due to (i) the alteration of the metabolic pathways of anaerobic bacteria under different conditions; (ii) the shift of the microbial community. It is remarkable that large amounts of lactate were degraded during all the operational periods, and the similar results were also found in some another study that fermented food waste for bio-hydrogenation (Han and Shin, 2004). Anaerobes utilizing lactate as substrate have been widely investigated. For example, Desulfovibrio sp. is capable of utilizing lactate when sulfide is added as an electron acceptor, or converting it into hydrogen directly under low hydrogen partial pressure (McInerney and Bryant, 1981). Some bacteria, like Clostridium acetobutyricum (Diez-Gonzalez et al., 1995) or Butyribacterium methylotrophicum (Shen et al., 1996), can even convert lactate to butyrate with a concomitant hydrogen production. The similar phenomenon was also reported in recent studies using mixed culture inoculation (Juang et al., in press). Lactate can thus be considered as an electron donor for hydrogen production, but whether there are specific bacteria which carry out this biochemical reaction still needs to be verified."
9,Microbial ecology analyses of I-CSTR under different HRTs,"3.2 Microbial ecology analyses of I-CSTR under different HRTs Due to the inconsistent results of preliminarily observing the microbial community using T-RFLP, cloning and sequencing were carried out two times with the sludge samples taken at days 17 and 235 during the operations representing the microbial ecology in Stages 1 and 3, respectively. The results aligned with published sequences available from the GenBank database are presented in Table 2 . According to the results obtained from Stage 1’s analyses, among the 154 clones retrieved, 96 (constituting 62% of the population, numbered as R1-1) were phylogenetically within Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, 20 (13%, R1-2) within Clostridium proteoclasticum, and eight (5%, R1-3) within Clostridium aminophilum, and with a final eight clones (5%, R1-4) were affiliated with uncultured bacterium. According to the results obtained from Stage 3’s analyses, 23 OTUs were observed in 155 clones. However, among these OTUs, 68 clones (44%, R3-1) were found to be affiliated with Olsenella genomosp, and 28 clones (18%, R3-2 and R3-3) were affiliated with uncultured bacterium. The rest of the clones found in Stages 1 and 3, which contributed less than 5% of population, were not sequenced. A total of four dominant OTUs (i.e., R1-1, R1-2, R1-3, and R3-1) found in Stages 1 and 3 were applied as markers for T-RFLP analyses. The terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) digested using MseI were 252, 508, and 521bps; the first two T-RFs denote R3-1 and R1-3, respectively, but the T-RF lengths of R1-1 and R1-2 are consistent as 521bps. The proportions of each T-RF were quantified according to the labeled fluorescent intensity, and all the proportional numbers in each stage were averaged to understand which kind of bacteria is dominant under different operating conditions. As the results presented in Fig. 3 show, in Stages 1 and 2, 521bps of the T-RF, which denotes the sum of B. fibrisolvens and C. proteclasticum, is the dominant one, whereas O. genomosp is the dominant one in Stage 3. The microbial community analyses are reliable due to the consistent results of the percentage constitution observed using cloning sequencing and T-RFLP. The phylogenetic positions of B. fibrisolvens are placed within cluster XIVa of the Clostridium subphylum (Collins et al., 1994). B. fibrisolvens is quite versatile in the polymeric substrates, and can metabolize cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin and starch as carbon source, and consequently generate butyrate, acetate and hydrogen (Russell and Rychlik, 2001; Hespell et al., 1987). This genus could be grown at 37°C, and many of the strains are not nutritionally fastidious and thus can be readily cultivated (Cotta and Forster, 2006). Therefore, this genus can also be isolated from some relatively adverse circumstances, like an anaerobic digester fed with napiergrass (Sewell et al., 1988). The two Clostridium species, C. aminophilum and C. proteoclasticum, which were originally isolated from bovine rumen, have been reported as ammonia-producing bacteria that are capable of amino acids or proteins degradation (Russell and Rychlik, 2001; Attwood et al., 1996). The first Olsenella sp. (Olsenella uli) was named by Dewhirst et al. (2001) via reclassification of Lactobacillus uli, and was originally found from human oral cavities and cow rumen (Dewhirst et al., 2001). The Olsenella sp. is also founded in some thermophilic anaerobic digesters (Weiss et al., 2009) and some other hydrogen fermentors fed with the cheese processing wastewater (Yang et al., 2007), molasses-wastewater (Chang et al., 2008), and xylose (Lo et al., 2008). O. uli (formally L. uli) is capable of producing lactate and trace amount of acetate during glucose fermentation (Olsen et al., 1991). With regard to solid fraction hydrolysis, B. fibrisolvens, C. aminophilium, and C. proteoclasticum are considered as polysaccharides and protein hydrolyzing bacteria, due to their hydrolytic activities (Russell and Rychlik, 2001; Attwood et al., 1996). As noted above, although lactate decomposition was clearly observed in Stages 1 and 2, these dominant bacteria have not been reported to be capable of producing hydrogen from lactate. However, Matsumoto and Nishimura (2007) inferred that the reaction of converting lactate and acetate into butyrate and hydrogen could be widely carried out by genus Clostridium. Therefore, this reaction might rely on these two Clostridium species (i.e., R1-2 and R1-3), or those non-identical parts (i.e., R1-4, R3-2, R3-3, or the fractions which constitute less than 5%), or perhaps some other unknown metabolic reactions occurred. With regard to the characteristics of Lactobacillus sp. considered similar to Olsenella sp., it can be found in starch-rich surroundings, like rumens of grain-fed cows (Russell and Rychlik, 2001), fermentors fed with starch (Wang et al., 2010; Li et al., 2010), and kitchen waste (Wang et al., 2005). Due to the characteristics of a high growth rate (μ =0.43h−1, Giraud et al., 1991), and being amylolytic, and acidouric (Hammes and Christian, 2006), it can also be found in the fermentors fed with high-concentration influent (71g-carbohydrateL−1, Wang et al., 2010; 12g-starchL−1, Li et al., 2010). The genus Olsenella can also be found frequently under similar high-loading conditions (12g-CODL−1, Yang et al., 2007; 40g-CODL−1, Chang et al., 2008). To bio-hydrogen researchers, lactic acid bacteria are notorious for their ability to inhibit hydrogen production (Noike et al., 2002), but their amylolytic abilities can also boost carbohydrate digestion. Although the amylolytic abilities of Olsenella sp. have not been reported yet, remarkably, the results of a higher percentage of Olsenella content still correspond to the relatively high carbohydrate removal (43%, higher than that in Stage 2). However, in this study, it could not be totally verified that the increase in the fraction of O. genomosp corresponded to the rising VLR. In addition, the pH control failure from days 150 to 180 might also affect the variations in the microbial community."
10,The effects of VLR on bio-hydrogen production,"3.3 The effects of VLR on bio-hydrogen production The linear dependence between VLR and r H 2 is presented in Fig. 4 , and some of the data from the other references are presented for the sake of comparison. According to the data, a linear equation of r H 2 = ( 2.83 VLR + 40.5 ) × 10 - 2 was regressed with a concomitant R 2 value of 0.816. Liu et al. (2006) and Massanet-Nicolau et al. (2010) demonstrated the use of mesophilic hydrogenation systems to digest household waste and sewage biosolids, and their data were located close to the linear range, while Wang et al. (2010) and Ueno et al. (2007) demonstrated the use of thermophilic (55–60°C) hydrogenation systems to digest food/kitchen waste, and their data were located above the linear range. In addition, some studies that applied food-processing wastewater, such as Ueno et al. (1996) and Yu et al. (2002), which used food and beverage processing wastewater, respectively, could achieve even higher r H 2 under relatively lower VLRs. For kinetic considerations, kitchen waste is definitely a promising feedstock with a high solid content (140g-CODL−1, Ueno et al., 2007). Thus, in this study, the VLR could be lifted to an extremely high level, and even operated with a longer HRT (over 100g-CODL−1 day−1, 1.33day of HRT, at Stage 3). However, with regard to the r H 2 , the processes utilizing solid waste cannot compete with those ones using wastewater. Kim and Lee (2010) employed tofu processing wastewater, and reported obtaining a remarkably high r H 2 of 12L-H2 L−1 day−1 with 60g-CODL−1 day−1 of VLR (not shown in Fig. 4). It is noticeable that hydrolysis is important for solid feedstock digestion. However, in Massanet-Nicolau et al. (2010), even though the sewage biosolids were pretreated with cellulase, the r H 2 could still not be enhanced significantly. Virtually, the process of digesting solid materials faces many problems. For example, in Liu et al. (2006) and Massanet-Nicolau et al. (2010), air-sparging methods were employed, and this significantly improved r H 2 . This indicates that it is also important to ease the hydrogen partial pressure when fermenting solid materials. In Wang et al. (2010) and Ueno et al. (2007), slightly better performances than those in the linear range occurred due to the thermophilic operation. In addition to accelerate the biochemical reactions, this result also implies that impairing the viscosity of oily compounds under higher temperature could also have positive effects."
11,Conclusions,"A mesophilic-kitchen-waste fermentor operated with a fill-and-draw process was demonstrated for a long-term operation. The strategy of increasing the feeding frequency to constrain the metabolic reactions within the log phases, consequently enhanced the r H 2 with increasing VLRs. This phenomenon contributes to a linear correlation between VLR and r H 2 , as described in Section 3.3. In addition, an increasing population of O. genomosp, observed by molecular methods, corresponded with the changes in exceeded lactate left in the stage operated with the highest VLR of 100g-CODL−1 day−1."
