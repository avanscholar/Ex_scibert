0,Introduction,"Owing to the worldwide fossil fuel crisis and related environmental impact, fabrication of high value-added platform chemicals from renewable biomass and biomass-derivatives by thermal catalysis reaction has aroused great research attention [1–5]. Furfural (FAL) with CC (furan ring) and CO (branched chain) bonds has been widely investigated and regarded as one of the key platform molecules in biomass conversion to synthesize important non-petroleum-derived fuels and chemicals [6], such as furfuryl alcohol (FOL) [7], tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFOL) [8], 2-methylfuran (2-MF) [9] through catalytic hydrogenation or hydrodeoxygenation. Among FAL catalytically converted products, FOL and THFOL have been extensively used in industrial processes as green solvents or intermediates for fine chemical synthesis, such as resins, lubricants, adhesives, fibers and wetting agents [10,11]. The selective hydrogenation of FAL to FOL or THFOL is generally performed under liquid-phase and vapor-phase conditions, but the latter is frequently associated with easier catalyst deactivation and poorer selectivity in comparison with the former [6,12]. To date, varieties of chromium-free catalysts, including noble metals (Pt, Pd, Ru and Rh) and non-noble metals (Co, Ni and Cu) catalysts, have been developed to investigate the catalytic performance of liquid-phase selective hydrogenation of FAL [8,12–14]. Among them, noble-metal catalysts have demonstrated high catalytic activities in FAL hydrogenation reactions, but their poor selectivity accompanying with some undesirable side reactions and high cost/source scarcity have limited their practical applications [15,16]. Therefore, development of non-noble metal catalysts with high catalytic activity and selectivity is still highly demanded for catalytic hydrogenation of FAL to target products. Many studies have demonstrated that Cu-based catalysts have been the most promising candidates to replace noble-metal catalysts for the selective conversion of FAL to FOL [17], exhibiting superior catalytic performance due to the prior adsorption of ƞ1 (O)-aldehyde group of FAL on Cu. However, such adsorption approach of FAL on Cu results in the poor selectivity of THFOL. Therefore, it is of great importance to explore more non-noble metal catalysts for highly efficient selective conversion of FAL to THFOL [11]. Thanks to easy hydrogenation properties and relatively low cost, nickel-based catalysts have been recently investigated for FAL hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis process [18–21]. Different with the Cu-based catalysts, the adsorption of FAL on Ni mainly occurs through both ƞ1 (O)-aldehyde and ƞ2 (C,O)-aldehyde modes, leading to superior catalytic activity of selective hydrogenation of FAL to THFOL [20]. In this respect, Nakagawa et al. reported that total hydrogenation of FAL to THFOL in vapor-phase reaction environment can be achieved with a selectivity of 94.3% over a highly dispersed Ni/SiO2 catalyst, and they thought that the total hydrogenation process of FAL to THFOL experiences two separate steps, namely, FAL to FOL and FOL to THFOL [20]. Generally, harsh reaction conditions (e.g., high temperature of 413K, high H2 pressure of 4.6MPa, long reaction time of 5h) are required to obtain high selectivity of THFOL with almost complete conversion of FAL over metallic nickel catalysts [6], which is undoubtedly high energy consumption. Some studies have revealed that high selectivity of FAL to THFOL in relatively mild reaction conditions can be obtained using modified metallic nickel catalysts [17]. For example, Nakagawa et al. reported that THFOL with 96% selectivity by FAL hydrogenation can be achieved at 313K under 8MPa after 2h reaction using Ni–Pd alloy catalyst [22]. Even so, the introduction of noble metal Pd inevitably enhances the cost of catalysts, limiting their scale-up production applications. Recently, N-doped carbon supported metal catalysts have been widely investigated for catalytic hydrogenation reactions, demonstrating superior catalytic activity and selectivity owing to N doping effectively tuning the electronic structure and surface property of carbon supports to promote the catalytic performance [23,24]. The N atom possesses higher electronegativity than the C atom, doping with the electron-rich nitrogen atoms can modify the surface structure of carbon materials with enhanced π-binding ability and improved basicity [25,26]. These advantages resulted from N doping in carbon materials effectively promotes the catalytic hydrogenation performance of N-doped carbon supported metal catalysts. In this respect, Xu et al. synthesized N-doped carbon supported metal Pd catalyst (Pd@CN0.132) for catalytic hydrogenation of vanillin in aqueous media under mild reaction conditions [27]. In their study, the high catalytic performance of Pd@CN0.132 can be due to the electronic activation of metal Pd particles with high stability and uniform dispersibility in water and the effect of N doping in carbon support [27]. Recently, Cui and co-workers reported well-dispersed Ru nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped carbon material, exhibiting excellent catalytic activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of aromatic ethers and phenols [28]. It has been generally accepted that N-doping in carbon structure can effectively regulate the surface electronic structure and physical/chemical property (e.g., surface Lewis basicity resulted from pyridinic-N doping) of carbon material, demonstrating significantly improved electro-catalysis activity [29–31]. These benefits caused from N doping may be fully utilized to construct N-doped carbon supported non-noble metal (e.g., metallic nickel) catalysts for improving catalytic hydrogenation performance under relatively mild reaction conditions. Herein, N-doped activated carbon (AC) supported metallic nickel (Ni/NAC) catalysts were fabricated by two-step calcination method in N2 atmosphere, and investigated for liquid-phase hydrogenation of FAL. It was found that N doping content and type in AC have important influence on the sizes of subsequent metallic nickel nanoparticles and catalytic hydrogenation activity of Ni/NAC. The results demonstrated that using N-doped AC with 1.0g melamine at 1073K in N2 atmosphere as support, the obtained Ni/NAC at 873K in N2 atmosphere with Ni nanoparticle sizes of ∼13.1nm (denoted as Ni/NAC-1-1073) achieves a N doping content of 3.65at.% and an atomic ratio of pyridinic-N to graphitic-N of 1.5, exhibiting almost 100% selectivity of THFOL with a complete FAL conversion at 353K after 3h reaction, obviously better than that of Ni/AC without N doping. Simultaneously, it was found that Ni/NAC-1-1073 can afford almost 100% conversion of FAL to FOL by transfer hydrogenation pathway in 2-proponal solvent at 413K after 5h reaction, while only 30.2% conversion of FAL to FOL can be obtained for Ni/AC without N doping under the identical experimental conditions. The performance enhancement mechanism has been discussed on the basis of the experimental results."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation of Ni/NAC catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of Ni/NAC catalysts Activated carbon (AC, Aladdin) was first washed by dilute acid and deionized water, followed by drying at 333K for overnight. In a typical synthesis, 0.5g AC and melamine with different amounts of 0.5, 1 and 2g were dispersed into 10mL of ethanol, and the resultant mixture was heated to 363K to volatilize the solvent under stirring. The obtained solid mixture was dried at 333K in air for 12h, and then calcined at different pyrolysis temperatures (973, 1073 and 1173K) for 2h with a ramp rate of 2Kmin−1 in N2 atmosphere to obtain N-doped AC with different N doping contents and types. The prepared N-doped AC was denoted as NAC-x-y (x represents melamine mass and y represents pyrolysis temperature). For preparation of Ni/NAC-x-y, 0.5g NAC-x-y was first dispersed into 0.5mL of 3molL−1 nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, AR, Sinopharm Reagents, China) to adequately adsorb Ni2+ for 30min under ultrasonication. Subsequently, Ni2+-adsorbed NAC-x-y was dried at 333K for 12h, and then calcined at 873K for 2h with a ramp rate of 5Kmin−1 in N2 atmosphere to obtain Ni/NAC-x-y catalysts. For comparison, Ni/AC without N doping was fabricated by the same procedure aforementioned except commercial AC instead of NAC-x-y as support."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The morphologies of samples were obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-2010) operated at an acceleration voltage of 200kV. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded on a Philips X-Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer with using the Ni-filtered monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (λKα1 =1.5418Å) at 40keV and 40mA. The surface area and porosity of samples were measured at 77K by a Surface Area and Porosity Analyzer (Autosorb iQ Station 1). The composition of samples was analyzed on an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo, USA) equipped with Al Kα1,2 monochromatized radiation at 1486.6eV X-ray source. Ni content in Ni/NAC-x-y composites was determined by the inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy after microwave digestion of the samples (ICP 6300, Thermo Fisher Scientific). H2-pulse chemisorption and CO2-TPD measurement were performed on the AutoChem II 2920 instrument equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). For H2-pulse chemisorption measurement, 50mg catalyst was first reduced in a 5vol.% H2/Ar mixture (30mLmin−1) to a final temperature of 450°C for 1h. Subsequently, the catalyst was purged with Ar at 500°C for 0.5h and then cooled down to room temperature. Finally, H2 was injected as a series of consecutive pulses at 50°C. For CO2-TPD measurement, 50mg catalyst was first reduced in a 5vol.% H2/Ar mixture (30mLmin−1) to a final temperature of 450°C for 4h, and then the catalyst was purged with Ar and cooled down to room temperature. And CO2 with a flow velocity of 50mLmin−1 was admitted to adsorb on the catalyst for 30min. Finally, the catalyst was purged with Ar to a final temperature of 700°C with a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1. TPD profiles were recorded during the whole process. Electrochemical measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760D, CH Instruments, Inc., Shanghai, China). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed by applying an AC voltage with 10mV amplitude in a frequency range from 100000 to 1Hz and recorded at 0.5V vs. Ag/AgCl electrode."
4,Catalysis performance tests,"2.3 Catalysis performance tests The catalytic hydrogenation of FAL (Aldrich, 99%) was carried out in a 25mL of stainless steel autoclave with a magnetic stirrer, a pressure gauge and an automatic temperature control apparatus. In a typical experiment, 20mg catalyst was dispersed into a mixture of FAL and 2-propanol (AR, Sinopharm Reagents, China) in reactor, and then the reactor was sealed, purged three times with N2 at 1MPa, then pressurized with H2, followed by heating to target temperature with a ramp rate of 2Kmin−1 for different reaction times. After reaction, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature and the reaction product was treated by centrifugation to separate catalyst and collect supernate for further analysis. The catalytic hydrogenation product was identified by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS, Thermo Fisher Scientific-TXQ Quntum XLS, column-TG-WAXMS, 30m×0.25mm×0.25μm), and was quantitatively analyzed by GC (Shimadzu, GC-2010 Plus), equipped with FID and a (30m×0.25mm×0.25μm) KB-WAX capillary column (Kromat Corporation, USA) using n-octanol as an internal standard. The carbon balance was checked in every run and it was found to be higher than 95%. FAL conversion and product selectivity were estimated using the following equations: Conversion FAL = ( 1 − mol of FAL after reaction mol of FAL taken initially ) × 100 % Selectivity of product = mol of each product mol of the amounts of products × 100 %"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Structure and composition of Ni/NAC catalysts,"3.1 Structure and composition of Ni/NAC catalysts Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of as-prepared Ni-based catalysts. The broad peak located at 2θ=23° is a characteristic peak of amorphous carbon [32]. The diffraction peaks at 44.5°, 51.9° and 76.5° are attributed to (111), (002) and (022) crystalline planes of metallic Ni (JCPDS 96-210-0662) with highly crystalline nature, respectively. Apparently, N doping in AC and calcination temperature do not have significant impact on the crystalline phase of metallic Ni under the given experimental conditions. Fig. 2 shows the TEM images of as-prepared Ni-based catalysts. As shown, metallic Ni particles are uniformly dispersed on the surface of AC (Fig. 2a) and NAC (Fig. 2b–f) supports with a narrow size distribution. Such uniformly dispersed property of metallic Ni particles on AC and NAC may be very favourable for the exposure of catalytic active sites, thus high catalysis performance. For Ni/AC, metallic Ni nanoparticles exhibit a mean particle size of ca. 12.6nm. The mean particle sizes of metallic Ni nanoparticles are approximate 11.6nm, 13.1nm, 14.6nm, 13.1nm and 13.7nm for Ni/NAC-1-973, Ni/NAC-1-1073, Ni/NAC-1-1173, Ni/NAC-0.5-1073 and Ni/NAC-2-1073, respectively. Apparently, N doping in AC obtained under different conditions as support results in a slightly different mean particle size of the formed metallic Ni nanoparticles, possibly leading to different catalysis performance [33,34]. Fig. S1a shows the HRTEM image of Ni/NAC-1-1073. As shown, the lattice spacings of the selected area are 0.203nm and 0.124nm, matching with the (111) and (022) planes of metallic Ni, respectively. The elemental mapping images of Ni/NAC-1-1073 further confirm that the N and Ni atoms are homogeneously dispersed on AC (Fig. S1b). Similar results can be also obtained for other Ni/NAC catalysts. The elemental composition and chemical states of Ni-based catalysts were further determined by XPS analysis. Fig. 3 a shows the surface XPS survey spectrum of Ni/NAC-1-1073, mainly composed of C (81.11at.%), N (3.65at.%), O (10.69at.%) and Ni (4.54at.%). The elemental composition information of other Ni-based catalysts is listed in Table 1 . As shown, only C, O and Ni can be found for Ni/AC, while an increase in melamine amount results in the increase of N doping content in AC and an increase of pyrolysis temperature leads to the decrease of N doping content in AC when fixed the melamine amount. The high resolution N 1s spectrum revealed that all Ni/NAC catalysts exhibit three N doping types in AC, namely, pyridinic-N (N1, 398.5eV), pyrrolic-N (N2, 400.1eV) and graphitic-N (N3, 401.1eV) (Fig. 3b–f) [35]. However, the contents of different N doping species in AC are highly dependent on the melamine amount and pyrolysis temperature (Table 1). When the pyrolysis temperature is set at 1073K, the content of pyridinic-N first increases and then decreases with increasing melamine amount from 0.5g to 2.0g, and dominant pyridinic-N in three N doped types can be obtained for Ni/NAC-1-1073. When the melamine amount is set at 1.0g, an increase of pyrolysis temperature from 973K to 1173K results in the decrease of pyridinic-N and the increase of graphitic-N in AC. Recent study has demonstrated that pyridinic-N can effectively contribute the carbon material surface with Lewis base property, possibly favourable for the adsorption of acidic functional groups or precursors on material surface, thus improving catalysis performance [31,36]. Also, some studies have revealed that graphitic-N in carbon based catalysts can effectively improve their electron transfer capability, thus resulting in high catalytic hydrogenation performance of catalysts [37]. In this work, Ni/NAC-1-1073 with dominant pyridinic-N and graphitic-N combined with uniformly dispersed metallic Ni nanoparticles may synergistically enhance the catalytic hydrogenation performance of furfural. The high resolution Ni 2p XPS spectra (Fig. S2) of Ni/NAC catalysts revealed that the Ni 2p3/2 peaks appeared at binding energies of 853.1eV and 855.5eV are attributed to zero-valent nickel and electro-deficient nickel species (Ni2+) species, respectively. Similarly, Ni 2p1/2 peaks located at about 870.5eV and 873.6eV were also fitted into two chemical states of nickel species (Ni0 and Ni2+) [38–40]. The peaks at 861eV and 880eV are satellite peaks ascribed to the shakeup excitation of the high-spin Ni2+ ions [39,41]. To investigate the actual Ni contents of all catalysts, the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy experiments were performed in this work. As shown in Table 1, only slight increase of Ni content can be observed for NAC supported Ni catalysts compared to AC supported Ni catalyst, indicating no significant influence of N doping in AC on subsequent Ni content. Specific surface area (SBET) and pore volume (Vpore) of samples were determined by N2 physisorption technique. It was found that all of samples exhibit microporous structures (Fig. S3). Moreover, it can be seen from Table 1 that the specific surface area of Ni/NAC samples increases with increasing calcination temperature and decreasing melamine amount. Among them, the Ni/NAC-1-1073 catalyst displays a large specific surface area of 561.2m2/g, favourable for the exposure of catalytic active sites caused from metallic Ni. In this work, CO2-TPD was used to evaluate the strength of surface Lewis basic sites. As shown in Fig. S4, a new strong peak at about 370°C can be observed in the CO2-TPD curve of Ni/NAC-1-1073 compared with Ni/AC, indicating more Lewis basic sites on Ni/NAC-1-1073 possibly created by N doping in AC [31]. Further, metallic Ni dispersion, specific area and average particle size were determined by H2-pulse chemisorption at 50°C, as shown in Table 2 . The Ni/NAC-1-1073 catalyst displays higher Ni dispersion (0.45%) and surface area (3.02m2 gNi −1) than Ni/AC (Ni dispersion of 0.36% and surface area of 2.44m2 gNi −1). The difference in particle sizes measured by TEM and H2-pulse chemisorption may be due to the retardation of hydrogen uptakes. Moreover, the metal surface area is only partially accessible for hydrogen chemisorption on supported metal. That is to say, a large part of Ni surface is blocked by activated carbon layers. This partial coverage of a metal by patches of a metal oxide is commonly observed for reducible oxide supports, such as TiO2. The above reasons may result in a larger Ni particle size obtained by H2-pulse chemisorption measurement in comparison with TEM observation. Especially, metallic Ni strongly encapsulated in the support surface may give rise to even larger difference. In this work, the metallic Ni particle diameter estimated from TEM observation is much smaller than that obtained from H2-pulse chemisorption measurement, which is an indication that the metallic Ni was strongly bound to the AC/NAC support surface, namely, strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) [42]."
7,Liquid phase hydrogenation of FAL,"3.2 Liquid phase hydrogenation of FAL 3.2.1 Effect of N doping content and type The catalytic activity of different Ni-based catalysts was investigated in FAL hydrogenation reaction, and the results are shown in Fig. 4 . The Ni/AC catalyst can afford 86.4% FAL conversion with 76.7% selectivity of THFOL at 353K after 3h reaction. However, the selectivity of THFOL increases dramatically to almost 100% with a complete conversion of FAL over Ni/NAC-1-1073 under the identical experimental conditions. The above results demonstrated that Ni/NAC-1-1073 possesses higher catalytic activity toward FAL hydrogenation than that of Ni/AC, implying a significant influence of N doping in AC support on FAL hydrogenation. To deeply understand the role of N doping, we measured the activity of N-doped AC supported Ni catalysts with different N contents and types. It is notable that FAL conversion increases first and then remains almost stable with the increase of N content from 2.92at.% to 5.51at.% in Ni-based catalysts (Ni/NAC-0.5-1073, Ni/NAC-1-1073, Ni/NAC-2-1073), and corresponding THFOL selectivity increases first and then decreases with further increasing N content. This is mainly due to the formation of small amount of FOL using high N content catalyst (Ni/NAC-2-1073). The above results indicated that a suitable N doping amount in AC is very important for FAL conversion with high THFOL selectivity. Also, we also investigated the influence of N doping temperature on FAL conversion performance of Ni/NAC catalysts. As shown in Table 1, with increasing N doping temperature, N doping content decreases from 4.64at.% to 3.15at.%. Also, it was found that a suitable N doping amount in AC is considerably important for FAL hydrogenation with 100% conversion and 100% THFOL selectivity. The above results suggest that Ni/NAC-1-1073 with an N doping content of 3.65at.% is the optimal catalyst of FAL hydrogenation under given experimental conditions in this work. High FAL catalytic hydrogenation activity of Ni/NAC-1-1073 may be ascribed to the dominant pyridinic-N and graphitic-N in AC support contributing Lewis base surface favourable for FAL molecule adsorption and superior electron transfer [31,37]. Fig. S5 shows the relationship of THFOL yield and doped N1/(N1+N3) content (N1: pyridinic-N, N3: graphitic-N) of Ni/NAC-1-973, Ni/NAC-1-1073 and Ni/NAC-1-1173 catalysts. Obvisouly, THFOL yield increases first and then decreases with N1 and (N1+N3) atomic percentage in these catalysts. Similarly, Ni/NAC-1-1073 with dominant pyridinic-N (N1) and graphitic-N (N3) exhibits the best catalytic hydrogenation performance of FAL to THFOL. Further, the Arrehenius plots derived by plotting the logarithm of the rate versus the inverse temperature over Ni/AC and Ni/NAC-1-1073 catalysts are shown in Fig. S6. Based on Arrhenius law, the corresponding apparent activation energy (Ea) was calculated to be 56kJmol−1 for Ni/AC and 48kJmol−1 for Ni/NAC-1-1073, indicating superior catalytic hydrogenation activity of Ni/NAC-1-1073. Additionally, TOF values were also calculated to investigate the intrinsic catalytic activity in a low activity (Table S1). The calculated TOF value of Ni/NAC-1-1073 is obviously larger than that of Ni/AC, meaning higher reaction rate using Ni/NAC-1-1073. The above results further confirm the significant role of N doping including doped content and type in Ni/AC catalyst for high catalytic performance of FAL hydrogenation [26]. In this work, Ni/NAC-1-1073 can afford almost 100% FAL conversion with 100% THFOL selectivity at 353K within 3h, which is superior to most reported catalysts for FAL hydrogenation reaction (Table S2). 3.2.2 Effect of reaction conditions The influence of reaction conditions (such as reaction temperature, H2 pressure and reaction time) on FAL hydrogenation was investigated using Ni/NAC-1-1073 in this work. Fig. 5 a shows the effect of reaction temperature on FAL conversion and corresponding product selectivity. As shown, FAL conversion is gradually increased with reaction temperature from 22.3% at 313K to >99.9% at 353K, and then reaches a stable status. For FAL hydrogenation product, FOL was detected to be major product at low reaction temperatures. With increasing reaction temperature, FOL was further converted to THFOL, and almost 100% THFOL selectivity can be achieved at 353K and 4MPa H2 pressure after 3h reaction. Fig. 5b shows the dependency of FAL conversion and product selectivity on reaction time at the reaction temperature of 353K and H2 pressure of 4MPa. Clearly, FAL conversion rapidly increases from 40.7% to>99.9% with reaction time from 0.5h to 1h. And an obvious shift of FOL to THFOL with reaction time can also be obtained, indicating that THFOL is from a further hydrogenation of furan ring in FOL. This is a very quick hydrogenation process under 353K and 4MPa H2 pressure. In liquid-phase hydrogenation process, an important variable affecting catalytic activity is the dissolved concentration of H2, which is directly proportional to H2 pressure. The effect of H2 pressure is therefore investigated in the range of 1–4MPa at reaction temperature of 353K and reaction time of 3h, as shown in Fig. 5c. The results reveal that FAL conversion and THFOL selectivity are enhanced with H2 pressure. At 1MPa H2 pressure, FAL conversion and THFOL selectivity can reach 65.1% and 51.3%, respectively. With increasing H2 pressure to 4MPa, almost complete FAL conversion and 100% THFOL selectivity were obtained, indicating an increase of FAL hydrogenation extent with H2 pressure. Additionally, the influence of mass ratio of catalyst to FAL in FAL hydrogenation was also investigated by varying FAL dosage. It can be seen from Fig. 5d that FAL conversion is almost complete when FAL dosage is two times of catalyst usage, accompanying with a slight decrease of THFOL selectivity. Based on the above experimental results, almost complete FAL conversion and THFOL selectivity can be reached using Ni/NAC-1-1073 under the reaction conditions of reaction temperature of 353K, reaction time of 3h, H2 pressure of 4MPa and mass ratio of catalyst to FAL of 1:1. 3.2.3 Catalyst recyclability The applicable stability of catalyst is critically important for its practical application. Therefore, we evaluated the recyclability of Ni/NAC-1-1073 at low conversion in this work. Following the first hydrogenation reaction, the reaction mixture was centrifuged to recover the catalyst. After washing with acetone and water, followed by drying at 333K in vacuum oven, the obtained Ni/NAC-1-1073 was further used for FAL hydrogenation test. After five recycles, FAL conversion remains almost unchanged and only slight decrease of THFOL selectivity can be observed (Fig. 6 ), indicating good stability of Ni/NAC-1-1073. After five recycles, Ni/NAC-1-1073 was also characterized by ICP, TEM and H2-pulse chemisorption techniques. By ICP measurement, only very small decrease in Ni content from 15.98wt.% for fresh Ni/NAC-1-1073 to 15.62wt.% for five times used catalyst was observed. Also, the morphology of metallic Ni particles on NAC support before and after use is very similar, as shown in Fig. S7. And H2-pulse chemisorption measurement shows only slight decrease in Ni dispersion and metal specific area after five recycles (Table 2), further confirming its high applicable stability."
8,Transfer hydrogenation of FAL to FOL,"3.3 Transfer hydrogenation of FAL to FOL Catalytic transfer hydrogenation of biomass-derived molecules has recently emerged as an alternative approach, and hydrogen donors, such as secondary alcohols, were used as hydrogen source to replace molecular H2, which poses an economic barrier for developing a sustainable biomass-upgrading industry, especially in the initial stages [43]. The transfer hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis of FAL with 2-propanol can be catalyzed by Pd/Fe2O3 [44] or Cu–Mg–Al [45] catalyst lately, but it is still desirable to develop an efficient, non-precious metal based catalyst system. Recently, Li et al. reported that the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of FAL to FOL was successfully achieved over N-doped carbon supported Fe catalysts [46]. Under the optimal reaction conditions, the selectivity of FOL reached 83.0% with a FAL conversion of 91.6% in their study. Here, we also investigated the catalytic performance of liquid-phase transfer hydrogenation of FAL by using Ni/NAC-1-1073 and Ni/AC and 2-propanol as hydrogen donor, as shown in Table 3 . It can be seen that FOL is the sole product in the process of transfer hydrogenation of FAL using both of the two kinds of catalysts. In this work, a certain amount of acetone was also detected, owing to the product of 2-propanol dehydrogenation. Under identical reaction conditions (reaction temperature of 413K and reaction time of 5h), Ni/NAC-1-1073 can afford a complete conversion of FAL with almost 100% FOL selectivity and exhibits better transfer hydrogenation performance than Ni/AC, possibly due to N doping in AC support. The above results reveal that Ni/NAC-1-1073 catalyst not only possesses excellent catalytic performance in FAL hydrogenation with H2, but also affords high catalytic activity in transfer hydrogenation with 2-propanol as hydrogen donor for the conversion of FAL to FOL."
9,Reaction mechanism,"3.4 Reaction mechanism Based on the above results, N doping in AC support should afford significant contribution in this work. Recently, Guo et al. reported that the active sites for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in N-doped carbon materials are carbon atoms with Lewis basicity next to pyridinic N [31]. For Ni/NAC-1-1073, the Lewis base sites can be created by dominant pyridinic-N, possibly resulting in a stronger adsorption of reactants on catalyst surface, thus facilitating FAL hydrogenation. Additionally, N doping in AC structure could effectively increase the electron density of metallic Ni nanoparticles [47], thus improving the interaction between reactants and catalyst. Many studies have demonstrated that N species doped in carbon structure can effectively improve the catalytic activity and selectivity in different catalysis systems [26]. Based on the reported results and our studies, in such a hydrogenation system, the N species doped in active carbon could play following roles: Firstly, the surface pyridinic-N species provide the co-interaction sites for Ni species, which gives rise to strong metalN bond at the interface, accompanied with well-dispersed Ni nanoparticles [48]; Apparently from Table 2, the Ni/NAC-1-1073 catalyst exhibits higher Ni dispersion (0.45%) than Ni/AC (0.36%). Secondly, the dominant pyridinic-N can make active carbon with Lewis basic sites to increase the dispersion of catalyst in 2-propanol and adsorption of reactants [31]. This can be confirmed by CO2-TPD measurement. As shown in Fig. S4, the desorption peaks at about 100°C and 350°C can be categorized into the weak and medium basic sites, respectively. A broad peak at ca. 100°C is related to the formation of hydrogenocarbonate species (e.g., HCO3 −) due to the reaction of CO2 with basic hydroxyl groups. The desorption peak at ca. 350°C assigned to the medium basic sites can be ascribed to pyridinic N doping in graphitic carbon structure, favourable for the adsorption of FAL molecules on catalyst surface for hydrogenation reaction. In a word, the N-doping derived basic sites play key role in controlling the product yield and selectivity, moreover the strength and number of basic sites on Ni/NAC-1-1073 catalyst is more than that on Ni/AC catalyst. Lastly, N doping in AC with dominant graphitic-N could effectively increase the electron transfer property of Ni/NAC-1-1073, thus improving the catalytic hydrogenation performance [37]. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of Ni/AC and Ni/NAC-1-1073 indicate that Ni/NAC-1-1073 possesses smaller impedance value, implying its higher catalytic hydrogenation activity compared to Ni/AC (Fig. S8). In a word, high catalytic hydrogenation performance of Ni/NAC-1-1073 can be ascribed to a synergistic effect of the above mentioned catalyst benefits. Further, we proposed a catalytic mechanism of liquid-phase FAL hydrogenation over Ni/NAC-1-1073 (Scheme 1 ). During hydrogenation reaction, FAL is first adsorbed onto metallic Ni surfaces either through ƞ1 (O)-aldehyde or ƞ2 (C,O)-aldehyde configuration [12,18]. Then the reaction path may comply with following steps: FAL is first converted into FOL, and then further converted to THFOL. In transfer hydrogenation process, the active hydrogen atoms were derived from 2-propanol dehydrogenation reaction on metallic Ni active surface at a relatively high temperature. In conclusion, hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation of FAL can be efficiently performed in liquid-phase under mild reaction conditions using this N-doped activated carbon supported metallic Ni catalyst."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural to FOL and THFOL was investigated over N-doped activated carbon supported metallic Ni catalysts (Ni/NAC), which was prepared by a facile two-step calcination method. We found that N doping content and type in activated carbon support can be effectively regulated by changing pyrolysis temperature and melamine amount, resulting in the subsequently formed Ni nanoparticles with different sizes and distributions affording different catalytic hydrogenation activities. Under optimized conditions, the Ni/NAC demonstrated complete FAL conversion for direct hydrogenation of FAL to THFOL with high applicable stability. More importantly, in the transfer hydrogenation of FAL to FOL, almost 100% FAL conversion was obtained at 413K. The high catalytic performance of Ni/NAC-1-1073 could be attributed to the synergy of active metal (Ni), suitable N doping content and type in activated carbon support to promote the catalytic performance. Meanwhile, reaction temperature, H2 pressure, reaction time and catalyst dosage also played important roles in determining the catalytic activity."
