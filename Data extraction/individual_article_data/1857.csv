0,Introduction,"Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of biomass pyrolysis oil using H2 gas, which is carried out under severe operating conditions of high pressure and high temperature, is a common method for pyrolytic oil upgrading to obtain a high-quality biofuel which is considered an essential alternative to fossil fuel-derived liquid fuels. However, the high operating pressures and temperatures required for pyrolysis oil hydrogenation using H2 gas make the process difficult to industrialize; hydrogen flammability in contact with air has safety issues at high H2 pressures in a large-scale industrial process. In addition, the high cost of the production and compression of H2 gas in addition to its difficult transportation and storage restrict its usage. Nowadays, transfer hydrogenation, in which a hydrogen donor (H-donor) molecule as a non-H2 gas hydrogen source is utilized, has attracted a great attention for the reduction of various unsaturated compounds for the production of value-added chemicals [1–9]. During the transfer hydrogenation reaction, a hydrogen atom or hydride ion is transferred from an H-donor molecule to an acceptor substrate [10]. Generally, chemicals with a high reducing potential can be a proper candidate for H-donors in the transfer hydrogenation reaction. In recent years, different H-donors, such as formic acid [11], sodium formate [12], and alcohols [13–16], have been applied to the transfer hydrogenation of various substrates, such as ketones [11], esters [11], aldehydes [12,17], and phenols [18]. Pyrolysis oil, which contains hundreds of chemicals, including acids, aldehydes, furans, ketones, phenols, and alcohols [19–22], can be considered a suitable acceptor substrate to explore the hydrogen transfer ability of H-donors. Although pyrolysis oil upgrading through direct hydrogenation using H2 gas has been investigated widely, transfer hydrogenation using a non-H2 source can be an influential alternative with the view of easy control, low cost of reducing agents, ready accessibility of the H-donor, and safety [9,23]. Thus far, although transfer hydrogenation has often been used for the transformation of pyrolysis oil model compounds [24–31], it has rarely been employed for the upgrading of crude pyrolysis oil [24–26]. Ying et al. [24] examined the transfer hydrogenation of acetone and phenol as pyrolysis oil representative models, and crude pyrolysis oil over Raney Ni using methanol as the hydrogen source. In this process, the aqueous phase reforming of methanol was coupled with hydrogen transfer to acetone, phenol, and pyrolysis oil (mainly ketones/aldehydes/phenols) for affording 2-propanol, cyclohexanone, cyclohexanol (from model compounds) and alcohols (from pyrolysis oil). NiCu supported on alumina and carbon were used in the transfer hydrogenation of p-cresol, furfural and pyrolysis oil using 2-propanol (2-PrOH) as the H-donor [25]. The reduction of p-cresol over NiCu/Al2O3 resulted in the formation of 4-methylcyclohexanol, 4-methylcyclohexanone (ring hydrogenation products), methylcyclohexane, and toluene (deoxygenated products). Furfuryl alcohol was produced via hydrogen transfer from 2-PrOH to furfural over a NiCu/Al2O3 catalyst. Transfer hydrogenation of pyrolysis oil under the similar conditions to those of p-cresol and furfural transformation led to an upgraded pyrolysis oil with higher H/C and C/O ratios. In the present study, the catalytic efficiency of Pd/C in the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol (a pyrolysis oil model compound) was evaluated using 2-PrOH as a H-donor, while no H2 gas was used. For this purpose, this study examined the effects of the reaction temperature, pressure, and time as well as Pd loading, catalyst content, and H-donor type on the catalytic performance of Pd/C during the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol. Furthermore, the reaction pathways for 2-PrOH dehydrogenation and guaiacol hydrogenation over a Pd/C catalyst were determined by exploring the chemical composition of the products obtained from the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol at different reaction times (1–6 h). In addition to 2-PrOH, the feasibility of using different alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, and 2-butanol, as H-donors for the transformation of guaiacol was investigated. Furthermore, the upgrading of crude pyrolysis oil through transfer hydrogenation reaction over Pd/C with 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH as H-donors was carried out, and the process efficiency was evaluated by determining the degree of deoxygenation of the pyrolysis oil, high heating value (HHV), and water content."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Guaiacol (98%) was provided by Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI). The pyrolysis oil used in this research was provided by Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER). Methanol (MeOH, SIGMA-ALDRICH, ≥99.9%), ethanol (EtOH, SAMCHUN, 99.9%), 1-propanol (1-PrOH, SAMCHUN, 99%), 1-butanol (1-BuOH, DAEJUN, extra pure), 2-butanol (2-BuOH, SAMCHUN, 99%), and 2-propanol (2-PrOH, SAMCHUN, 99.5%) were used as H-donors. The palladium catalyst (5 and 10 wt%) supported on activated carbon (5Pd/C and 10Pd/C) was purchased from SIGMA-ALDRICH and used as received. The physicochemical properties of the 10Pd/C catalyst were analyzed by nitrogen adsorption-desorption (Table S1) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. S1)."
3,Transfer hydrogenation experiments,"2.2 Transfer hydrogenation experiments All the hydrogenation experiments were carried out in a 100 ml autoclave reactor (Parr series 4598, Parr Instrument Company, USA) equipped with a magnetic drive stirrer and water cooling solenoid. For the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol, a mixture of guaiacol (0.5 g) and H-donor (30 g) was loaded into the reactor. A Pd/C catalyst (0.2–0.5 g) was added to the autoclave under the inert atmosphere of N2. After loading the reactor with guaiacol, H-donor, and catalyst, it was sealed, and the air inside the reactor was replaced with N2 gas by pressurizing/depressurizing the reactor several times. Afterward, the reactor was pressurized with N2 gas (0.5–12 bar) and heating was started. The transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol was carried out at 190–230 °C and a stirring rate of 500 rpm for 1–6 h. After the reaction, the reactor was cooled rapidly to room temperature and the solid catalyst was separated from the liquid product by vacuum filtration. The yields of liquid and solid products were determined by weighing the separated liquid and solid phases. The gas yield was calculated by difference. The qualitative and quantitative (using external standards) distributions of the liquid product compositions were determined by GC–MS/FID (7890A Agilent Technologies). The gas products were collected in gas sampling bags for analysis using a GC/TCD/FID. For guaiacol hydrodeoxygenation using H2 gas as the hydrogen source, guaiacol (0.5 g) was mixed with 30 g MeOH or distilled water, and 0.4 g Pd/C catalyst was then added to the mixture under a N2 atmosphere. After preparing the reactor loaded with the reactants and catalyst, as described above, it was charged with 40 bar H2 gas and heated. The hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol was carried out at 230 °C and a stirring rate of 500 rpm for 4 h. After the reaction, the product was collected and analyzed, as mentioned for the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol. For the transfer hydrogenation of pyrolysis oil, the reactor was charged with a 30 g sample of a mixture of pyrolysis oil and H-donor (with pyrolysis oil to H-donor ratio of 1:3 w/w). After the reaction, the H-donor fraction of the refined pyrolysis oil was separated by vacuum distillation at 40 °C. The water content and elemental composition (CHNS) of the H-donor-free pyrolysis oil were analyzed using Karl Fischer Titration (870 KF Titrino plus, Metrohm) and Flash EA 2000 series (Thermo Fisher), respectively."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Reaction pathway proposed for the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol using 2-PrOH as the H-donor,"3.1 Reaction pathway proposed for the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol using 2-PrOH as the H-donor To determine the dehydrogenation mechanism of 2-PrOH over 10Pd/C, the dehydrogenation of 2-PrOH in the absence of guaiacol was carried out at 230 °C for 4 h. Acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone, and 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone were the only compounds in the product sample detected by GC (Fig. S2). Dehydrogenation of 2-PrOH affords acetone which can be further involved in the successive reactions of aldol condensation, dehydration, and hydrogenation to give diacetone alcohol, mesityl oxide, and methyl isobutyl ketone, respectively. Thereafter, methyl isobutyl ketone can be converted into 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone through the oxygenation reaction. Wang et al. [32] also reported a similar reaction for the 2-PrOH dehydrogenation over the Pt/C catalyst. Scheme 1 presents the reaction network proposed for the dehydrogenation of 2-PrOH. The catalytic transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol was carried out at different reaction times (1–6 h) to explore the reaction pathways for the transformation of guaiacol and its intermediates at 230 °C. Fig. 1 shows the evolution of guaiacol conversion and products yield as a function of time. Guaiacol conversion was approximately 98%, even after 1 h reaction and reached 100% after a 6 h reaction. As shown in Fig. 1, the yields of phenol, cyclohexanol, cyclohexanone, 2-methoxycyclohexanone, and 2-cyclohexen-1-ol increased initially and then decreased with time, indicating that they are intermediary products. Increasing the reaction time from 1 to 4 h, remarkably improved the yield of (1-methylpropyl)cyclohexane as an oxygen-free product. A further increase in the reaction time to 6 h slightly decreased the formation of (1-methylpropyl)cyclohexane, whereas 2-methyl-2-cyclohexen-1-ol and 2-cyclopenten-1-one were only detected in the product samples obtained after 5 and 6 h reaction. In addition, the yield of guaiacol derivatives (alkylated guaiacol and guaiacol acetates) was decreased by prolonging the reaction time, indicating that the reaction time should be sufficiently high for guaiacol deoxygenation through transfer hydrogenation using 2-PrOH as a H-donor. Generally, 2-methoxycyclohexanone (two-oxygen-containing compound), methoxycyclohexane, cyclohexanol, 2-methyl-2-cyclohexen-1-ol, 2-cyclopenten-1-one, cyclohexanone, 2-cyclohexen-1-ol, phenol (one-oxygen-containing compounds), and (1-methylpropyl)cyclohexane (oxygen-free compound) were formed during the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol and their possible production pathways are illustrated in Scheme 2 . Guaiacol was transformed initially into 2-methoxycyclohexanone and phenol through ring hydrogenation and demethoxylation mechanisms, respectively. Based on the yield data presented in Fig. 1, the demethoxylation of guaiacol to phenol appears to be the dominant reaction pathway. Cyclohexanol was produced via the successive hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone and 2-cyclohexen-1-ol, and then cyclohexanol. The hydrogenation and dehydration of 2-methoxycyclohexanone resulted in methoxycyclohexane as a final product. Since 2-methoxycyclohexanone was only produced at a reaction time of 1 h, it can be inferred that methoxycyclohexanone was readily transformed into its related products. 2-Cyclopenten-1-one might be formed through the ring opening-closing of cyclohexanone, which is possibly produced from both the hydrogenation of phenol and the demethoxylation of 2-methoxycyclohexanone. A possible reaction for (1-methylpropyl)cyclohexane generation could be the alkylation of cyclohexanol and 2-cyclohexen-1-ol by 2-PrOH-derived intermediates to methylpropyl cyclohexanol, followed by dehydration to (1-methylpropyl)cyclohexane. As methylpropyl cyclohexanol was not detected in the product samples, it can be considered as a reactive intermediate compound that is consumed completely during the transfer hydrogenation reaction. To gain a better understanding of the reaction pathway of guaiacol transformation over 10Pd/C using a 2-PrOH H-donor, the distribution of gaseous products obtained from the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol at different reaction times was also examined, as shown in Table 1 . Although the total yield of gaseous products was almost constant throughout the reaction time of 1–5 h, a further increase in the reaction time to 6 h led to an increase in the gas yield. CO, CO2, methane, propane, and other hydrocarbon gases (≥C5) were common gas products. A remarkable yield of propane suggests that a considerable amount of 2-PrOH is converted into propane during the transfer hydrogenation reaction. Generally, three reactions can proceed from 2-PrOH over catalytic sites: dehydrogenation to acetone, dehydration to propene, and hydrogenolysis to propane. Fikis et al. [33] suggested that 2-PrOH initially adsorbs on the catalyst surface to form acetone and propene. By desorbing acetone and propene from the surface sites, some of these active sites may then be occupied by hydroxyl and hydrogen species, which can be used further in the 2-PrOH hydrogenolysis to propane. Since no considerable amount of propene was produced during the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol over 10Pd/C using 2-PrOH as a H-donor, it can be inferred that acetone was produced initially and then its desorption from the catalyst sites left hydrogen species, which were used in guaiacol hydrogenation. High formation rate of propane through the reaction between 2-PrOH and hydrogen species on the catalytic sites highlights the potential of 2-PrOH to provide the hydrogen required for hydrogenation reactions. Our data reveal that the yield of propane was increased progressively with increasing reaction time."
6,Effect of reaction temperature on the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol,"3.2 Effect of reaction temperature on the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol The effect of reaction temperature (190–230 °C) on the catalytic activity of 10Pd/C for the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol was investigated using 2-PrOH as a H-donor. The reaction temperature had a great influence on the yields of liquid, solid, and gas products; raising the reaction temperature led to a decrease in the liquid yield and an increase in the gas and solid yields (Fig. S3). The trends of product yields and guaiacol conversion with respect to reaction temperature are illustrated in Fig. 2 . Although an increase in temperature from 190 to 210 °C improved the guaiacol conversion from 96 to 98.5 wt%, a further increase to 230 °C did not promote further conversion. Although some guaiacol had transformed into its derivatives at lower reaction temperatures (190 and 210 °C), increasing the temperature to 230 °C decreased the formation of guaiacol derivatives remarkably, indicating that a low reaction temperature might cause a sort of side reactions to produce guaiacol derivatives. It is clear from Fig. 2 that the maximum amount of (1-methylpropyl)cyclohexane as an oxygen-free product was obtained at 230 °C. Temperature also has a great influence on dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions [24]. Raising the reaction temperature can provide the activation energy required for both 2-PrOH dehydrogenation and guaiacol hydrogenation. It was observed that the highest yields of methoxycyclohexane and cyclohexanone were achieved at 230 °C. Methoxycyclohexanone was produced only at 190 °C because of the incomplete reaction at low temperatures. When the temperature was increased from 190 to 230 °C, the yield of cyclohexanol started slightly increasing. Meanwhile, the influence of reaction temperature on the product selectivity is shown in Fig. 3 . The selectivity of the products changed with temperature, showing a similar trend to the yield data; the selectivity to phenol and guaiacol derivatives decreased significantly with increasing temperature. The highest temperature of 230 °C prevented the side reactions of guaiacol to its derivatives. Methoxycyclohexane formation started at 210 °C and its selectivity increased to 3.3% at 230 °C. It was clear that the maximum selectivity to (1-methylpropyl)cyclohexane was reached at 230 °C."
7,Effect of the nitrogen pressure on the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol,"3.3 Effect of the nitrogen pressure on the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol As the amount of hydrogen produced in a transfer hydrogenation system can be affected by the initial nitrogen pressure [34,35], the effects of the initial N2 pressure (0.5, 8, and 12 bar) on the performance of 10Pd/C for the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol using 2-PrOH as a H-donor was investigated at 230 °C. A remarkable decrease in the yields of gas and solid products together with a significant increase in the yield of liquid product were observed with an increase in the nitrogen pressure (Fig. S4). Raising the pressure might improve the hydrogen production from the H-donor and the solubility of hydrogen in the reaction media, leading to an enhanced efficiency for the transfer hydrogenation reaction [34]. The enhanced hydrogenation efficiency caused by the pressure increase could also be a reason for the reduction in the solid formation during the reaction. The conversion and product distributions during guaiacol transfer hydrogenations at different nitrogen pressures are shown in Fig. 4 . The low pressure of 0.5 bar was favorable for the side reactions, forming a large amount of guaiacol derivatives. Although the conversion of guaiacol decreased with increasing initial pressure of nitrogen, the transformation of guaiacol to its derivatives decreased significantly. An increase in nitrogen pressure was in favor of the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol to (1-methylpropyl)cyclohexane, indicating that the activity of the 10Pd/C catalyst for the hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol/guaiacol intermediates increased considerably with an increase in nitrogen pressure. A high pressure condition facilitates the separation of intermediates/products from the active sites of the catalyst, leading to a higher accessibility of the catalytic sites for the H-transfer reaction of reactants. In addition, the lower formation of unfavorable solid (char and coke) products under high-pressure conditions could delay the catalyst deactivation rate and improve the process efficiency because solid production is the main cause of catalyst deactivation during the hydrogenation reactions. The liquid product distribution of transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol at different nitrogen pressures is also presented in Fig. 5 . The product selectivity also confirmed the considerable pressure dependence of the reaction. An increase in pressure caused the formation of cyclohexanol and 2-cyclohexen-1-ol and decreased the selectivity to phenol. A low nitrogen pressure of 0.5 bar hinders the formation of cyclohexanol/2-cyclohexen-1-ol, which can result from phenol hydrogenation. The low pressure of 0.5 bar was favorable for the formation of ethoxybenzene and cyclohexanone, while a higher pressure was favored for the hydrogenation reactions, resulting in higher selectivity to cyclohexanol, 2-cyclohexen-1-ol, methoxycyclohexane, and (1-methylpropyl)cyclohexane. At nitrogen pressures of 8 and 12 bar, the efficiency of the transfer hydrogenation reaction was remained almost unchanged. When the pressure was increased from 8 to 12 bar, the selectivity to (1-methylpropyl)cyclohexane decreased slightly. Therefore, a moderate nitrogen pressure of 8 bar was selected for further experiments on the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol at 230 °C."
8,Effects of the Pd loading and catalyst content on the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol,"3.4 Effects of the Pd loading and catalyst content on the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol Fig. 6 shows the effects of the palladium loading in the Pd/C catalyst on the yield of products obtained from the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol using 2-PrOH as a H-donor. It was observed that the yields of liquid, solid, and gas products over 5Pd/C and 10Pd/C were 71.11, 21.81, and 7.08 wt% and 84.01, 10.70, and 5.29 wt%, respectively, indicating that 10 wt% Pd/C has much higher catalytic activity than 5 wt% Pd/C. This suggests that the amount of active Pd metal should be sufficiently high to efficiently promote the hydrogenation of guaiacol. In terms of the product distribution over a Pd/C catalyst, the reduction in Pd loading from 10 to 5 wt% decreased the catalytic activity for the production of the oxygen-free compound, (1-methylpropyl)cyclohexane, approximately 3.5 times. Although (1-methylethylidene)cyclohexane and ethanone, 1-(1-cyclohexen-1-yl)- were only produced over 5Pd/C, the yield of phenol and cyclohexanol were still quite high over this catalyst. This clearly demonstrates that at a low Pd loading, the number of active sites is not sufficiently high for catalyzing both reactions of 2-PrOH dehydrogenation and guaiacol hydrogenation, which are supposed to proceed simultaneously on the Pd active sites. The catalyst content is also an important factor affecting the product distribution in the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol. Increasing the amount of 10Pd/C catalyst from 0.2 to 0.5 g during the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol using 2-PrOH as a H-donor led to an increase in gas yield and a decrease in liquid yield (Fig. S5). As illustrated clearly in Fig. 7 , practically no significant changes in the yields of methoxycyclohexane, cyclohexanol, and cyclohexanone were observed for catalyst amounts of 0.2–0.5 g, and cis-1,2-dimethylcyclopropane, trans-1-methyl-1,2-cyclohexanediol, and ethanone, 1-(1-cyclohexen-1-yl)- products were only produced over 0.5 g 10Pd/C. The effect of the catalyst content on the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol was clearly observed in the production of (1-methylpropyl)cyclohexane; a large reduction in the formation of this product was detected by the use of 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 g 10Pd/C, while the maximum yield of (1-methylpropyl)cyclohexane (6.80 wt%) was obtained using 0.4 g 10Pd/C. With 0.2 and 0.3 g catalyst, the number of active sites was not sufficiently high for efficient guaiacol hydrodeoxygenation to (1-methylpropyl)cyclohexane. In contrast, a larger amount of 10Pd/C (0.5 g) promoted the formation of propane (data are not shown) from 2-PrOH significantly, which was produced competitively with (1-methylpropyl)cyclohexane from guaiacol conversion. The high yield of phenol at a catalyst content of 0.5 g was attributed to the reduced efficiency in phenol hydrogenation to cyclohexanone, 2-cyclohexen-1-ol, and cyclohexanol."
9,Effect of the H-donor type on the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol,"3.5 Effect of the H-donor type on the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol The feasibility of using MeOH, EtOH, 1-PrOH, 1-BuOH, 2-PrOH, and 2-BuOH as a H-donor for guaiacol transformation over 10Pd/C was examined at 230 °C. Alcohols can be a suitable candidate for H-donor applications in the hydrogenation process owing to the non-corrosive character of alcohols and their potential use as both the solvent and reactant as well as the easy separation of their final products (aldehydes and ketones) after the transfer hydrogenation reaction [23]. Although no conversion of guaiacol was detected in the primary alcohols of MeOH, EtOH, 1-PrOH, and 1-BuOH, 98.5 and 100 wt% guaiacol conversion was achieved using the secondary alcohols of 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH, respectively. Superior performance of the secondary alcohols over primary alcohols in the hydrogen transfer reaction was also reported by Wang and Rinaldi [36] and Villaverde et al. [31]. Indeed, in hydrogen transfer from primary alcohols over the 10Pd/C catalyst, decomposition of the O–H bond results in the formation of an H-adatom and a surface alkoxy group. The alkoxy group might act as an inhibitor for guaiacol transformation due to blocking of the catalyst surface. In contrast, in hydrogen transfer from secondary alcohols over 10Pd/C, decomposition of both O–H and α-C–H bonds is occurred, leading to the generation of two H-atoms and acetone. Since acetone leaves the catalyst surface, catalytic active sites, including H-atoms, are available for the reactants to be involved in hydrogenation reactions. The selectivity of the liquid product compounds obtained from the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol using 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH is depicted in Fig. 8 . Although the full conversion of guaiacol was detected when 2-BuOH was used as a H-donor, the formation of (1-methylpropyl)cyclohexane, as an oxygen-free product, was not sustained by carrying out the reaction in 2-BuOH. This is in agreement with the reaction pathway proposed previously for the production of (1-methylpropyl)cyclohexane, in which 2-PrOH-derived intermediates were supposed to be involved in the alkylation of cyclohexanol/2-cyclohexen-1-ol (guaiacol intermediates) to methylpropyl cyclohexanol, which was dehydrated further to (1-methylpropyl)cyclohexane. The selectivity to guaiacol derivatives in 2-BuOH was slightly higher than that in 2-PrOH. In addition, 1-methylcyclohexanol, 2-methoxycyclohexanone, 1-ethyl-1-methylcyclopentane, and butoxybenzene were only produced when the reaction was performed in 2-BuOH probably due to the reactions caused by 2-BuOH-derived intermediates. Compared to 2-PrOH, higher yields of CO and methane and lower yield of long chain hydrocarbons (≥C5) were detected in the gas product of reaction using 2-BuOH as a H-donor (Table 2 ). Furthermore, butane was the dominant gaseous product obtained from the transfer hydrogenation reaction in 2-BuOH. The activity of 10Pd/C in guaiacol hydrodeoxygenation was examined using hydrogen gas (40 bar initial pressure) as the reducing agent and methanol as the solvent. After 4 h reaction at 230 °C, liquid product sample analysis showed that only 1-methoxycyclohexane and 1,2-dimethoxy cyclohexane (cis and trans) were produced from guaiacol (85 wt% guaiacol consumption), indicating that no complete deoxygenation of guaiacol occurred when hydrogen gas was applied as a reductant. The lower hydrogenation efficiency in the system of hydrogen gas could be attributed to the difficult accessibility of the catalytic sites by hydrogen molecules due to mass transfer limitation. On the other hand, the mass transfer problem might be eliminated by the use of liquid hydrogen sources, which are supposedly in proper contact with the catalyst active sites. Besides, as previously mentioned, the formation of alkoxy group on the catalytic sites in the presence of methanol might suppress the accessibility of active sites by hydrogen and guaiacol molecules, decreasing the hydrodeoxygenation efficiency of the process. To overcome the problem of alkoxy group, guaiacol hydrodeoxygenation over 10Pd/C was carried out using water as solvent. In comparison to methanol, guaiacol transformation (100 wt% guaiacol consumption) in water resulted in completely different product compounds; 2-cyclohexen-1-ol and 3,3,4-trimethyldecane were the dominant products, whereas cyclohexanol and 1,2-cyclohexanediol were produced in much smaller amounts. In contrast to the transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol using a 2-PrOH H-donor, which resulted in the complete deoxygenation of guaiacol to oxygen-free cyclic compound of (1-methylpropyl)cyclohexane, guaiacol hydrodeoxygenation under hydrogen gas using methanol and water as solvents only resulted in one-oxygen-containing cyclic compounds such as 1-methoxycyclohexane/1,2-dimethoxy cyclohexane and 2-cyclohexen-1-ol, respectively."
10,Transfer hydrogenation of crude pyrolysis oil,"3.6 Transfer hydrogenation of crude pyrolysis oil The upgrading of pyrolysis oil was carried out under the optimized conditions for transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol. The properties of crude pyrolysis oil and upgraded pyrolysis oil (elemental composition, high heating value (HHV), and water content) are listed in Table 3 . A comparison of the elemental composition of crude pyrolysis oil and upgraded pyrolysis oil in 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH indicates an increase in carbon content and a decrease in oxygen content. The HHV of pyrolysis oil (13.21 MJ/kg), which is very low compared to petroleum oils (41–43 MJ/kg [37,38]), was also improved to 20.05 and 25.86 MJ/kg through a 25.67 and 38.12% decrease in oxygen content during the transfer hydrogenation process in 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH, respectively. A very remarkable decrease in the water content of pyrolysis oil was also observed after transfer hydrogenation in 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH. The zero content of water in the pyrolysis oil upgraded in 2-BuOH could be due to the close boiling points of 2-BuOH and water, causing the complete separation of water together with 2-BuOH during the solvent separation step. The high water content in pyrolysis oil imparts polarity to this fuel, causing the immiscibility of pyrolysis oil in fossil fuels. Replacing 2-PrOH with 2-BuOH improved the degree of deoxygenation and the heating value of pyrolysis oil remarkably. Although the guaiacol deoxygenation efficiency using 2-BuOH was lower than that using 2-PrOH, the degree of deoxygenation of pyrolysis oil in 2-BuOH was significantly higher than that in 2-PrOH, probably due to its stronger reaction with the pyrolysis oil components, excluding guaiacols."
11,Conclusions,"In this study, 2-PrOH was used successfully as an alternative to hydrogen gas in the hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol (a pyrolysis oil model compound) and crude pyrolysis oil over 10Pd/C catalyst. Compared to guaiacol hydrodeoxygenation under hydrogen gas using methanol and water as solvents which resulted in only one-oxygen-containing cyclic compounds such as 1-methoxycyclohexane/1,2-dimethoxy cyclohexane and 2-cyclohexen-1-ol, respectively, transfer hydrogenation of guaiacol using 2-PrOH as a liquid hydrogen source resulted in the complete deoxygenation of guaiacol to (1-methylpropyl)cyclohexane. During the transfer hydrogenation reaction, hydrogen was released from 2-PrOH over the catalyst active sites and acetone was formed. The guaiacol molecules activated on catalytic sites were then hydrogenated by the hydrogen atoms provided by 2-PrOH on the catalyst surface. In addition to 2-PrOH, 2-BuOH could also act as a H-donor for guaiacol transformation over 10Pd/C at 230 °C. Although (1-methylpropyl)cyclohexane was produced as the major product in guaiacol transformation in 2-PrOH as a H-donor, 2-BuOH could not promote the reaction to form any oxygen-free compound. On the contrary, the performance of 2-BuOH in the upgrading of raw pyrolysis oil through a transfer hydrogenation process was superior to that of 2-PrOH; a higher HHV (25.86 MJ/kg) and degree of deoxygenation (38.12%) of pyrolysis oil accompanied with its lower water content were obtained during pyrolysis oil upgrading using 2-BuOH as a H-donor."
