0,Introduction,"Deoxygenation of carbonyl compounds is of great importance in fine-chemical synthesis, pharmaceutical industry as well as the upgrade of biofuels [1–9]. Known approaches for deoxygenation include the classic Barton–McCombie (R3SnH) [10], Clemmensen (Zn/Hg, HCl) [11,12], and Wolff-Kishner methods [13,14]. However, these methods suffer limitations including harsh reaction conditions and high production costs as well as the need for stoichiometric levels of reducing reagents, significant levels of toxic wastes, and poor functional-group tolerance. To solve these problems, catalytic deoxygenation of carbonyl compounds with H2 [15–17] or other hydrogen donors such as organic silanes [18–20] and alcohols [21] has been developed. For example, the deoxygenation of carbonyl compounds with organic silanes can be performed under relatively mild conditions because of the high activity of organic silanes [18–20]. In this context, Stephan and co-workers reported the deoxygenation of aromatic carbonyl compounds with polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS) at 25 or 40 °C over a Pd/C catalyst (Fig. 1 , reaction a) [18]. However, the use of PMHS is not very competitive, owing to the relative lower atom efficiency and the relative higher cost in comparison with H2. Several catalytic protocols have been reported for the deoxygenation of carbonyl compounds using H2 [15–17]. The pivotal problems of the processes using H2 as reductant are harsh reaction conditions (high pressure or temperature) and the need for special equipment and safety precautions to minimize the risk of explosion. Yi and co-workers employed a homogeneous catalyst of Ru–pincer complexes with a phenol ligand at 130 °C and 2 bar H2 (Fig. 1, reaction b) [15]. In parallel, Stephan and co-workers performed the deoxygenation of diaryl ketones in toluene by the combined catalysts of B(C6F5)3 and molecular sieves (MS) at 70 °C and 60 bar H2 [16]. The use of homogeneous catalysts complicates the workup and purification procedures. From the viewpoint of sustainable and green chemistry, the development of a heterogeneous catalytic system for the deoxygenation of carbonyl groups under mild conditions is highly desirable but challenging goal. The deoxygenation of carbonyl compounds generally involves the hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds into alcohols and the reduction of the alcohol to give an alkyl group. In principle, the hydrogenation of carbonyl groups into hydroxyl groups is much easier [16,22,23]. For example, a graphene-modified Ru catalyst was active for the reduction of carbonyl groups into hydroxyl groups at 20 °C and 40 bar H2 [22]. Therefore, the success of reduction of hydroxyl groups is a key step for the deoxygenation reaction under mild conditions. The properties of the supports such as the acid–base properties and redox properties sometimes deliver important benefits to the catalytic activity of the supported metal catalysts [9,24]. In recent years, nitrogen-containing carbon materials have been considered as promising supports for metal nanoparticles [25,26]. The incorporation of nitrogen atoms in the carbon matrix can enhance their chemical, electrical, and functional properties, which in turn influences the catalytic activity of the supported metal nanoparticles. For example, Beller and co-workers discovered that nitrogen-doped carbon supported Co3O4 was active for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene at 110 °C and 40 bar H2, while the carbon supported Co3O4 was almost inactive [25]. The nitrogen atoms doped in the carbon materials have two important functions for catalysts developed for deoxygenation. Firstly, they develop a strong electronic interaction with the metal nanoparticles [27,28]. Secondly, nitrogen atoms in the transition-metal complexes act as Lewis bases to promote the activation of hydrogen molecules [29–31]. In this study, Pd nanoparticles on nitrogen-doped, highly porous carbon support were found to be active for the deoxygenation of carbonyl groups at room temperature and atmospheric hydrogen pressure."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation 2.1.1 Preparation of supported Pd catalysts Nitrogen-doped carbon materials (NC) were prepared using resorcinol, melamine and formaldehyde as a polymer source. In a typical procedure, water (20 mL), formaldehyde (15 mL) and melamine (4.0 g) were stirred at room temperature to give a whitish opaque suspension, and then heated at 55 °C for 5 min. Then, NaOH (10 mL, 0.5 M) solution was added to the heated suspension that was continuously stirred at 55 °C until a clear solution was observed. Subsequently 36.5 wt.% HCl (3.0 mL) and resorcinol (7.0 g) were added to the solution. After the formation of a transparent sol-gel, it was poured into a plastic disk, and dried at 55 °C for 24 h. The dried gel was removed from the plastic disk and dried in an oven at 55 °C for 24 h. Subsequently, the dried sample was calcined in a tubular furnace in nitrogen atmosphere and at 800 °C for 3 h. The heating rate from room temperature to 800 °C was 3 °C/min. NC (2.0 g) was added into KOH solution (7.14 M, 20 mL) and the mixture was stirred for 1 h. Then, the mixture was allowed to stand in an oven at 110 °C to evaporate water. The impregnated sample was then calcined 800 °C for 3 h. The calcined sample was subsequently soaked in distilled water for a week to fully remove the remaining KOH and salts formed during the activation. Each day, the aqueous washing solution was replaced with fresh distilled water to maximize the removal of KOH until its pH-value was close to 7. The NC after the treatment by KOH was abbreviated as NC-BT. To load Pd on the nitrogen-doped carbon material, NC-BT (200 mg) was dispersed in water (20 mL) with the assistance of ultrasonication for 1 h. Then Na2PdCl4 (16.4 mg) in 5 mL of water was added dropwise, and the mixture was subjected to ultrasonication for another 1 h. After that, NaBH4 (13.7 mg) in 5 mL of water was added dropwise. Then the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5 h. Finally, the catalyst was washed with water and ethanol, and dried at room temperature in a vacuum oven."
3,Characterization of catalysts,"2.2 Characterization of catalysts Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of the samples were performed on an FEI Tecnai G2-20 instrument. The sample was firstly dispersed in ethanol and dropped onto copper grids for observation. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the catalysts were conducted on a Bruker advanced D8 powder diffractometer (Cu Kα). All XRD patterns were collected in the 2θ range of 10–80° with a scanning rate of 0.016°/s. Micropore and mesopore surface area and pore size measurements were performed with N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77 K on a V-Sorb 2800P instrument. Before measurements, the samples were degassed at 100 °C for 12 h. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on a Thermo VG scientific ESCA MultiLab-2000 spectrometer with a monochromatized Al Kα source (1486.6 eV) at constant analyzer pass energy of 25 eV. The binding energy was estimated to be accurate within 0.2 eV. All binding energies were corrected referencing to the C1s (284.6 eV) peak of the contamination carbon as an internal standard. The palladium content in the catalysts was determined by inductively coupled atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) on an IRIS Intrepid II XSP instrument (Thermo Electron Corporation), and the nitrogen content was determined on the Vario Micro cube instrument. Raman spectra were measured on a confocal laser micro-Raman spectrometer (Thermo Fischer DXR) equipped with a diode laser of excitation of 532 nm (laser serial number: AJC1200566). Spectra were obtained at a laser output power of 1 mW (532 nm), and a 0.2 s acquisition time with 900 lines/mm grating (Grating serial number: AJG1200531) in the wavenumber range of 50–3500 cm−1. The dispersion of Pd nanoparticles of the as-prepared catalysts was measured by the CO chemisorption method on a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 instrument. Prior to analysis, 0.1 g sample was charged into the reactor, and the temperature was raised to 120 °C under He flow for 4 h and then 20 mL/min H2 for 1 h. Temperature was brought back and kept at room temperature under helium flow for another 2 h. Then CO pulses were injected. Surface area and dispersion of metallic palladium were determined assuming CO/Pd = 1 chemisorption stoichiometry."
4,Catalytic deoxygenation,"2.3 Catalytic deoxygenation The catalytic deoxygenation of biomass derived vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde), a common component of pyrolysis oil derived from lignin fraction [35], was used as a model reaction. The reaction with H2 pressure >1 bar was performed in a stainless steel 40 mL Parr batch reactor. Typically, vanillin (1 mmol, 152 mg), Pd/NC-BT (20 mg) and tetrahydrofuran (THF, 15 mL) were charged into the reactor. The reactor was purged with H2 5 times, then charged with 5 bar H2 at room temperature. The reactor with H2 was heated to 50 °C within 3 min, commencing the catalytic reaction. The reaction was maintained at 50 °C for 1 h, while the reaction mixture was mechanically stirred at 1000 rpm. The reaction was stopped by cooling the reactor to room temperature and depressurized. The reaction mixture was diluted with THF and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) using toluene as the internal standard. When the reaction was performed under constant H2 pressure (1 bar), the reaction was performed in a glass reactor with the same procedures. An Agilent HP5973 mass spectrometer was used to identify the products. The data in this work were provided on the average of the three times. The content of the products generated was analyzed by a GC (Agilent 7890A) instrument with a crosslinked capillary HP-5 column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.4 mm) equipped with a flame ionization detector. The temperature of the column was initially kept at 80 °C for 3 min, and then increased at a rate of 20 °C min−1 to 220 °C. Products were identified by comparison of the retention time of the unknown compounds with those of standard compounds and quantified based on the internal standard method. The products were confirmed by GC–MS (Agilent 7890A GC/5973 MS, HP-5 column)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst preparation and characterization.,"3.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization. The preparation of the nitrogen-doped, highly porous carbon supported Pd nanoparticles (denoted as Pd-NC/BT) catalysts is schematically depicted in Fig. 2 . The nitrogen-doped carbon (denoted as NC) was prepared by the carbonization of melamine-resorcinol-formaldehyde at 800 °C. The obtained material (NC) was impregnated with KOH and caclined at 800 °C to increase the porosity of support (denoted as NC-BT). Pd nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of NC-BT by reducing a palladium salt with NaBH4 to give the Pd/NC-BT catalyst with a Pd content of 2.85 wt.%. For comparison, commercially available active carbon (AC) was also treated under the same procedures, and it was labeled as Pd/AC-BT. TEM images of the Pd/NC-BT catalyst reveals that Pd nanoparticles are well dispersed (Fig. 3 A), and the mean size of the particles is 4.5 nm (Fig. 3B). The lattice fringe spacings in the high resolution TEM image were measured as 0.23, 0.20 nm (Fig. 3C, for an enlarged and clear high resolution TEM image, please see Fig. S3), corresponding to interplanar distances of (1 1 1), (2 0 0) lattice planes. High angle annular dark-field (HAADF)-STEM images of the Pd/NC-BT (Fig. 3D) catalyst also confirms that the Pd nanoparticles were dispersed on the surface of the NC-BT support. Pd nanoparticles are also homogenously distributed on the surface of NC (see the TEM image of Pd/NC, Fig. S1), however the mean size of the Pd nanoparticles in this catalyst is smaller (2.9 nm) than that of the Pd/NC-BT catalyst. The smaller size of Pd nanoparticles for the Pd/NC catalyst is due to its higher nitrogen content (Table S1), as the nitrogen atoms with lone pairs of electrons could serve as sites for the nucleation of Pd nanoparticles, and stabilize the Pd nanoparticles [34]. In addition, a similar size of Pd nanoparticles (mean particle size is 4.3 nm) is observed in the TEM image of Pd/AC-BT (Fig. S2) in comparison with Pd/NC-BT. In addition, the dispersion of the Pd nanoparticles were determined to be 28%, 29% and 40% for the Pd/NC-BT, Pd/AC-BT and Pd/NC catalysts, respectively. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of the samples have a shape of the IV-type isotherm with a H4 hysteresis loop (Fig. S4), indicating that these samples have a large amount of mesopores. The large adsorption of the samples in the relative pressure P/P0 range below 0.1 indicates the existence of numerous micropores in the samples. The textural parameters of the samples are summarized in Table S2. The total BET surface area and total pore volume of NC were determined to be 637 m2/g, and 0.45 cm3/g (Table S2). There were two kinds of the pores in NC, namely mesopore and micropore with an average size of 13.0 nm and 0.5 nm, respectively (Table S2). After the treatment with KOH, BET surface area and pore volume greatly increased to 2037 m2/g and 1.38 cm3/g for the NC-BT support (Table S2). However, the average mesopore size of NC-BT support decreased to 6.8 nm, and the average size of micropore remained. The treatment with KOH creates micropores by the oxidative reaction between carbon and KOH at high temperature [32,33]. Loading Pd nanoparticles onto the NC and NC-BT sup-ports resulted in slightly decrease of the surface area, average size of mesopore and pore volume (Table S2). The Pd/AC-BT catalyst has a specific surface area of 1815 m2/g. However, nitrogen weight percentage decreased from 3.68% in NC to 0.97% in NC-BT (Table S1). The KOH treatment also resulted in loss of the nitrogen-containing functional groups. As discussed later the large specific surface area can make a critical contribution to the performance of the catalyst. The XRD pattern of the Pd/NC-BT catalyst is compared with that of the parent NC-BT in Fig. 4 A. Three additional peaks at 2θ = 39.2°, 45.3°, and 66.4° are observed in the XRD pattern of Pd/NC-BT, which are the characteristic reflections from (1 1 1), (2 0 0) and (2 2 0) planes of Pd0 particles (JCPDS No.05-0681), respectively [35]. They are the planes of Pd0 nanoparticles observed in HRTEM image (Fig. 3C). The mean size of the Pd crystallites was calculated from the (1 1 1) diffraction peak using the Scherrer equation, to be 5.9 nm. Two peaks with 2θ at 24.5° and 43.5° in the XRD patterns of NC-BT and Pd/NC-BT are assigned to the turbostratic ordering of the carbon and nitrogen atoms in the graphite layers and the intra-layer condensation for the nitrogen-doped carbon material, respectively [36]. This partial graphitization is further affirmed by bands in the Raman spectra of the samples (Fig. S5). Two characteristic peaks appear around 1355 cm−1 and 1585 cm−1 in the Raman spectra of the samples of NC, NC-BT and Pd/NC-BT, respectively. They are assigned to the D band and G band. The D band is related to disordered structure, while the G band is assigned to the vibration of all sp2 hybridized carbon atoms of the carbon layers [36]. Interestingly, the intensity ratio of the ID/IG band increased in an order of NC, NC-BT and Pd/NC-BT. These results indicate that the treatment of KOH increased defects of carbon structures, and the defects were further increased by the deposition of Pd nanoparticles on the surface of NC-BT. XPS survey-scan spectra of the Pd/NC-BT catalyst indicated that no potassium salts or KOH were present in the catalyst (Fig. S6). Due to the low nitrogen content in the Pd/NC-BT catalyst, N 1s peak was too weak to be visible in the survey-scan spectrum of the catalyst. The N 1s band in high resolution XPS (Fig. S7) could be deconvoluted into three types of nitrogen with the binding energies as follows: pyridinic-N (398.4 eV), pyrrolic-N (399.4 eV), and graphitic-N (400.8 eV) [36]. Also, the binding energies of metallic Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 of the Pd/NC-BT catalyst are 335.7 and 341.0 eV (Pd0 ), respectively, lower than corresponding values for the Pd/AC-BT catalyst (336.0 and 341.3 eV) (Fig. 4B). The shifts of the binding energies are attributed to the interaction between Pd nanoparticles with the electron-rich nitrogen atoms [37]."
7,Optimal conditions for the catalytic performance,"3.2 Optimal conditions for the catalytic performance Catalytic deoxygenation of biomass-derived vanillin was used as the model reaction to evaluate the catalytic performance of the Pd/NC-BT catalyst. Experimental factors such as temperature, H2 pressure, solvent and support materials have noticeable influence on the performance. Full vanillin conversion and excellent 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol (MMP) selectivity (95.8–100%) were achieved within 1 h at 50 °C under 5 bar H2 in solvents containing oxygen (Table 1 , Entries 1–4). However, poor results were observed in other solvents (Table 1, Entries 5–7). These results suggest that the oxygen atoms in the solvents promote the deoxygenation of vanillin into MMP. This is possibly due to the hydrogen bonds between the solvents and reactants (vanillin and vanillyl alcohol) [41]. In this context, Jiang and co-workers studied the hydrogenation of α, β-unsaturated ketones in ethanol over Au clusters to give unsaturated alcohols [41]. They found that ethanol could stabilize the partially hydrogenated intermediate of CO hydrogenation via a hydrogen bond, leading to a smaller H2 cleavage energy than the CC bond, and thus giving the selective reduction of CO bond. The lower selectivity of MMP in water (Table 1, Entries 1–4 vs Entry 8), compared with oxygen-containing organic solvents, could be attributed to the poor solubility of vanillin and vanillyl alcohol in water. Nearly quantitative conversions were also attained in ethanol and iso-propanol after 1 h at 25 °C and 5 bar H2 (Table 1, Entries 9 and 10). However, the byproducts from the etherification of vanillyl alcohol and ethanol or iso-propanol were also observed with yields around 10%. The reaction in tetrahydrofuran (THF) also achieved near quantitative conversion without the formation of the byproducts (Table 1, Entries 11). Thus, THF was selected as the optimal solvent for the deoxygenation of vanillin at room temperature. The influence of H2 pressure on the deoxygenation of vanillin conversion was studied over the Pd/NC-BT catalyst (Table S3). It was noted that the hydrogen pressure showed no significant influence on the conversion of vanillin. However, the product selectivity was influenced by the hydrogen pressure, especially from 1 bar to 2.5 bar. These results suggested that the hydrogenolysis of vanillyl alcohol was more sensitive to hydrogen pressure, as this step was the rate-determining step (Discussed later). Of particular note is that Pd/NC-BT catalyst even exhibited excellent catalytic activity at 25 °C and atmospheric H2 pressure (Table 1, Entries 12 & 13), achieving quantitative deoxygenation of vanillin to MMP within 3.5 h (Entry 13). The superior performance of the Pd/NC-BT catalyst under mild conditions enables the use of common glass reactors rather than expensive equipment that withstand high temperature and high hydrogen pressure. We also found that the Pd/NC-BT catalyst was highly stable with quantitative MMP yields for the six consecutive runs (Table S4) as the mild reaction conditions did not cause the growth and aggregation with an average size of 4.7 nm (Fig. S8) or loss of Pd nanoparticles, which has sometimes been observed for other supported Pd catalysts under harsh reaction conditions [42]. The Pd nanoparticles (Fig. 4b) were also stabilized by the strong interaction between the nitrogen atoms of the support and the Pd particles. In addition, a hot filtration test was also performed to further confirm the stability of the Pd/NC-BT catalyst. After reaction at 25 °C and 1 bar H2 for 20 min, the Pd/NC-BT was removed, and the reaction mixture was further stirred under the same condition for 3 h. It was noted that the conversion of vanillin remained 83.8% after the removal of the catalysts. The selectivity of vanillyl alcohol and MMP also remained 84.1% and 15.9%. These results once again confirm the Pd/NC-BT catalyst was highly stable. There are three pathways for the deoxygenation of carbonyl groups (Fig. 5 ): (A) hydrogenation/dehydration/hydrogenation, (B) hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis, and (C) direct hydrogenolysis of the CO bond. According to the results in Fig. 6 , vanillin was almost quantitatively converted within 30 min and the main product is vanillyl alcohol. The selectivity for vanillyl alcohol gradually decreased from 91.9% at 10 min reaction to zero at 210 min reaction, meanwhile the selectivity for MMP gradually increased from 8.1% to 100%. Thus, the deoxygenation of vanillin catalyzed by the Pd/NC-BT catalyst follows Pathway B in Fig. 5: vanillin is first hydrogenated to vanillyl alcohol, and then the hydrogenolysis of vanillyl alcohol into MMP. According to the results in Fig. 6, the hydrogenolysis of vanillyl alcohol is the rate-determining step. The catalytic performance of the Pd/NC-BT catalyst was compared with the two representative Pd/NC and Pd/AC-BT catalysts. Pd/NC exhibited a lower vanillin conversion and selectivity for MMP than Pd/NC-BT (Table 1, Entries 12 vs 16). The major differences between Pd/NC-BT catalyst and Pd/NC catalysts are pore structure and nitrogen content while the Pd contents of the two samples are similar. The Pd/NC catalyst has a higher nitrogen content than the Pd/NC-BT catalyst (Table S1), in which nitrogen atoms enhance the catalyst activity by the electronic interaction with Pd nanoparticles as well as serving as a Lewis base to promote the heterolytic cleavage of H2 (discussed in the following paragraph), the superior catalytic activity of Pd/NC-BT to that of Pd/NC is likely to arise from the larger porosity. The total surface area and pore volume of Pd/NC-BT are much greater (more than three times) than those of Pd/NC. The large porosity of the catalyst permits much more reactants to be absorbed on the catalyst surface as well as the fast diffusion of reactants to Pd particles in the pores, facilitating the reaction, because the diffusion of the reaction molecules on the catalyst surface is the first step for the heterogeneous catalytic reaction. This argument is supported by the results shown in Table S5 that Pd/NC-BT exhibited stronger absorption ability both for vanillin and the intermediate vanillyl alcohol than Pd/NC under the same conditions. It was reported that that the nitrogen atoms in the carbon supported metal catalysts played a positive role in the enhancement in the adsorption of the substrates [26]. Given that Pd/NC catalyst has higher nitrogen content than the Pd/NC-BT catalyst, the higher ability of the adsorption of the substrates over the Pd/NC-BT catalyst should be due to its larger surface area. Also, the catalytic performance of Pd/NC-BT is better than that of Pd/AC-BT (Table 1, Entry 12 vs Entry 17), while the porosities and specific surface areas (Table S2) of Pd/NC-BT and Pd/AC-BT are similar. The marked differences in both vanillin conversion and selectivity to MMP should be related to the nitrogen atoms in the Pd/NC-BT catalyst, which could enhance the power to reduce vanillyl alcohol to MMP. Firstly, the nitrogen atoms should act as Lewis bases to promote the heterolytic cleavage of H2 (discussed later). Secondly, the strong interaction between Pd nanoparticles and nitrogen atoms (see Fig. 4b) enhances the electron density of Pd nanoparticles [38], which increases the interaction of the back-bonding from the Pd d orbital to the CO 2π* antibonding orbital, weakening the CO bond [23]. Thirdly, the enhanced electron density of Pd by nitrogen atoms also strengthen the binding energy of hydrogen molecules with Pd nanoparticles. [38] According to the above analysis, the presence of nitrogen atoms in the Pd/NC-BT catalyst can both improve the catalytic activity of the hydrogenation of vanillin into vanillyl alcohol, and the followed the hydrogenolysis of vanillyl alcohol into MMP. Thus, a higher conversion of vanillin and a higher selectivity of MMP were attained by the Pd/NC-BT catalyst over the Pd/AC-BT catalyst (Table 1, Entry 12 vs Entry 17). Nitrogen-doped carbon materials have been successfully used as alternatives to metal catalysts for some organic transformations [39,40]. Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that the doped nitrogen atoms play a role in enhancing the reduction power of the Pd/NC-BT catalyst. More importantly, the large scale experiment of the developed method was also performed. After prolonging the reaction time to 48 h, a high MMP yield was also obtained by the use of 10 mmol of vanillin (Table 1, Entry 18)."
8,Substrate scope,"3.3 Substrate scope The scope of the new catalytic protocol for other carbonyl compounds was also explored using the Pd/NC-BT catalyst. The carbonyl group in substituted aromatic aldehydes was successfully reduced to a methyl group with other reducible groups and the aromatic ring structure remaining unchanged. The reduction of the substrates with electron-donating groups (Table 2 , Entries 1–6) was generally easier than that of those with electron-withdrawing counterparts (Table 2, Entries 8–16). Both the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group to give the alcohol group and the subsequent hydrogenolysis of the alcohol group to methyl group involves carbo-cation intermediates (discussed later), and electron-donating groups could clearly stabilize such intermediates, affording higher reaction rates. The catalytic reduction of 2-bromobenzaldehyde is slower than that of the two other regioisomers due to steric hindrance (Table 2, Entries 13 vs 11, 12). The carbonyl group in fused-ring aromatic aldehyde (2-naphthaldehyde) and the heterocyclic aldehyde (4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde) were also quantitatively reduced to methyl group (Table 2, Entries 17 & 18). Compared with benzaldehyde, 4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde demonstrated a lower activity (Table 2, Entries 1 vs 18), which should be due to the following two reasons. On the one hand, the presence of N in pyridine decreases the electron density of the aromatic ring, which would low the activity of 4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde. On the other hand, the lone electron pair of nitrogen atoms in pyridine ring may affect the absorption of substrate on Pd catalysts, as it also have the ability to adsorb on the surface of Pd nanoparticles [42]. The deoxygenation of aromatic ketones is more difficult than that of aromatic aldehydes, which required long reaction times to get high yields under the same conditions (Table 2, Entry 1 vs Entry 19, Entry 7 vs Entry 20). The lower activity of ketones can be attributed to the greater steric hindrance of the carbonyl group of ketones. This phenomenon was very evident for benzophenone despite the high electron density of the carbonyl group (Table 2, Entry 21). It is worth noting that the Pd/NC-BT catalyst was inactive for the reduction of aliphatic carbonyl compounds, probably because of the lower electron densities of the CO bonds. Nevertheless, this feature could be an advantage and be exploited for selective deoxygenation of an aromatic carbonyl in the presence of an aliphatic one (Table 2, Entry 22). Interestingly, this method also was useful for the deoxygenation of acetylferrocene (Table 2, Entry 23), which is a fuel additive in rocket propellants [44]. In addition, it was also inactive for the deoxygenation of phenol over the Pd/NC-BT catalyst at room temperature and 1 bar H2, because the conjugation of the lone pair electron with the aromatic ring, called p-π conjugation, results in a high stability of phenol. However, the release of the hydroxyl group from aromatic alcohols (e.g. benzyl alcohol) generated a high stable benzyl cation (Discussed in mechanism part as follows), followed by the addition of hybrid to give the deoxygenation product. Of particular note is that our method was tolerant to other functional groups such as ester, ether, amine, phenol, nitrile, nitro, aliphatic carbonyl, and halogen groups as listed in Table 2. The wide substrate scope and the mild reaction conditions make this method promising for the economical and environmentally friendly deoxygenation of carbonyl compounds into fuels and valuable chemicals at industrial scales."
9,Mechanistic investigations,"3.4 Mechanistic investigations The deoxygenation of carbonyl compounds with H2 typically involves the activation of H2 to generate active hydrogen species and the reaction of the hydrogen species with carbonyl compounds and corresponding intermediates (mainly alcohols). To determine which process is the rate-determining step, we used p-fluorobenzylaldehyde, of which the deoxygenation is slightly difficult so that the kinetic data were measured accurately, as substrate to study the kinetics. Figs. S9 and S10 display the relationship of the reaction rate with substrate concentration and hydrogen pressure. The reaction order with respect to the concentration of p-fluorobenzylaldehyde was zero (experimental data shows 0.03), suggesting that a strong interaction was present between the substrate and the catalyst surface [43]. The reaction order with regards to the H2 pressure was 1.15, and the reaction rate was dependent on the H2 pressure. Hence, the activation of H2 molecules to generate hydrogen species is the rate-determining step. This conclusion is supported by the results of isotope labeling experiments shown in Fig. 7 . The reaction rate constant of kH/kD was calculated to be 1.62. There are two pathways for activation of H2 molecules: homolytic and heterolytic cleavage of H2. The proton (H+) and the hydride (H−) via the heterolytic cleavage of H2 have been generally accepted to be the active species for the reduction of polar bonds such as CO and CN bonds [45]. The nitrogen atoms in the Pd/NC-BT catalyst would act as Lewis bases to promote the heterolytic cleavage of H2. In fact, nitrogen atoms in the transition metal complexes, or the external addition of organic amines have been to act as Lewis base for the heterolytic cleavage of H2, yielding NH+ and metal-hydride (M−H−) [29–31]. Based on the aforementioned information, we propose a tentative mechanism for the deoxygenation of aromatic carbonyl compounds (Fig. 8 ). First, the carbonyl compounds and H2 molecules absorb on the catalyst. The nitrogen atoms in the catalyst act as Lewis base to promote the heterolytic cleavage of H2 molecules to generate NH+ and the Pd-hydride species (Pd-H−), which then add to the polarized Cδ+ Oδ− bond to yield the hydroxyl group (CH2OH). The addition of H+ from NH+ to the Oδ− to form aromatic carbon cations should be the first step, followed by the addition of H− from to Pd-H− to give the hydroxyl group (CH2OH), because releasing the H+ in NH+ should be more readily than releasing H− from to Pd-H−. In the subsequent hydrogenolysis of the alcohol group, the H+ from NH+ surface species first combine with hydroxyl group (OH) in alcohols to generate a good leaving group (H2O). The benzyl cations (Ph-CH2 + or Ph-CH+-R) generated by the H2O leaving, are stabilized by aromatic rings, especially with the electron-donating groups [46]. Finally, the addition of H− from Pd-H− to the benzyl cations yields the final products with a methyl group. To further support the proposed mechanism, the Hammett equation and isotope labeling experiments were performed. The Hammett plot for the rate constants of a series of p-substituted benzylaldehyde (X = p-OMe, p-Me, p-t-Butyl, p-H and p-F) also supports the deoxygenation of carbonyl groups into methyl groups involving carbocation intermediates. The Hammett σ-values does not serve for these reactions, as the data showed serious deviations in the Hammett treatment. Normally, unsatisfactory results will be observed for treating electrophilic reactions with Hammett σ-values when strong resonance interactions occur between electron-supplying substituents and the electron-deficient centers of the reacting systems [47]. However, a linear relationship between log(kX/kH) and Brown–Okamoto constant σ+ was observed with a ρ value of −1.62 (Fig. 9 ), suggesting that the deoxygenation of the carbonyl groups is substituent-sensitive and involves a cationic intermediate [47]. Electron-donating groups enhance the electron density of the aromatic rings and thus, stabilize the cations, thus favoring the reaction process. As further support for this mechanism, the deoxygenation of carbonyl groups by combinations of proton (H+) and hydride (H−) like species has also been reported for other catalytic systems [16]. In addition, two additional isotope labeling experiments were performed. The hydrogenation of benzylaldehyde and benzaldehyde-18O were performed over the Pd/NC-BT catalyst at room temperature and 1 bar hydrogen pressure, and no isotope effect was observed for the hydrogenation rate. However, an obvious isotope effect was observed for the hydrogenolysis of benzyl alcohol and benzyl alcohol-18O with a KIE value of 2.15. These results further confirmed that the hydrogenolysis of the hydroxyl group in alcohol was the rate-determining step of the deoxygenation of carbonyl groups into saturated compounds."
10,Conclusion,"In conclusion, the Pd/NC-BT catalyst exhibits excellent activity for the selective deoxygenation of a wide variety of carbonyl compounds at room temperature and atmospheric H2 pressure. Both the nitrogen atoms of the support and highly porous structure of the catalyst play key roles in the superior catalytic performance. The strong interaction between the nitrogen atoms and Pd nanoparticles, not only stabilizes the particles, but also enhances the reduction power of the catalyst enabling the efficient reduction of alcohol groups to alkyl groups. In addition to this, the nitrogen at the surface of the support can act as Lewis base to promote the heterolytic cleavage of H2 in coordination with the Pd nanoparticles. The Pd/NC-BT catalyst is stable for recycling because the Pd particles are well dispersed in the pores of the support and the mild catalytic reaction conditions do not cause deterioration of the catalyst structure. Thus, this catalytic protocol holds promising potential for the environmentally friendly and economic conversion of carbonyl compounds into valuable fuels and chemicals in industrial settings."
