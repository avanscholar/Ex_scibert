0,Introduction,"The oxidation of pyridines to the corresponding N-oxides is an important chemical procedure due to the wide usefulness of the products. Heterocyclic N-oxides have important roles in organic synthesis, which are used as protecting groups, auxiliary agents, oxidants, catalysts, surrogates for heterocyclic boronic acids and ligands in metal complexes [1–4]. These oxides usually are prepared by a non-catalytic oxidation process using peracids [5], H2SO5 [6], dioxiranes [7] and magnesium monophthalate [8]. From the green chemistry and the need for chemical industry to minimize waste production associated with stoichiometric regents, catalytic oxidation systems using hydrogen peroxide as oxidant with active catalysts have been developed recently, such as AcOH/H2O2 [9], MeReO3/H2O2 [10], trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA)/H2O2 [11] and Tf2O/Na2CO3·1.5H2O2 [12]. However, the catalysts in these active systems are not reusable. Some heterogeneous catalysts like perfluoroketone-silicate [13], TS-1 [14] and V x Si4x O6.4x [15] were also demonstrated for the oxidation of pyridines. But in these heterogeneous systems, the high reaction temperature or the long reaction time is required. So the design of a new recyclable, effective and green catalytic system for pyridine oxidation is still necessary. Carbonyl compounds are important group of molecules in organic chemistry [16–18]. The selective oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds is a key transformation in organic synthesis. Most examples of alcohol oxidation with hydrogen peroxide employed polyoxometalates as catalysts have been reported [19–26]. Recently, the catalytic oxidation of alcohols using recyclable catalysts has received much attention, such as reaction-controlled phase transfer catalysts [27,28], water-soluble polyoxometalates [29–35], polymer-supported catalysts [36,37] and inorganic–organic hybrid mesoporous materials [38]. These catalytic systems were active for alcohol oxidation, and the catalysts were all reusable after reaction. However, these procedures have some of the following disadvantages: the recovery of the catalysts was controlled by the amount of H2O2, the reused catalysts were difficult to obtain, some solid alcohols or hydrophobic alcohols were hardly reactive or the catalyst was not easy to synthesize. The search for new, facile, cost-effective, and environmentally benign procedures that avoid the use of toxic solvent and expensive oxidant still attracts substantial interest. We tried to design a reusable catalytic system for pyridine oxidation and alcohol oxidation based upon temperature-dependency. Some methods have been explored for the recovery and reuse of the catalyst by controlling temperature, such as the temperature-dependent multi-component solvent systems [39] and the protocols based on temperature-dependent solubilities of fluorous compounds [40]. Herein, we firstly report a recyclable and effective catalytic system for pyridine N-oxidation and alcohol oxidation based on a temperature-controlled phase transfer catalyst. The catalyst was synthesized by lacunary Keggin phosphotungstate anion combined with dioctadecyl dimethyl ammonium ion, ([(C18H37)2(CH3)2N]7[PW11O39]), and it has temperature-responsive behavior in a biphasic mixture of aqueous H2O2 and 1,4-dioxane. The catalyst was insoluble in the system at room temperature, but dissolved with the elevation of reaction temperature. After the reaction finished with cooling, the catalyst precipitated gradually from the system itself. The catalyst effectively catalyzed the oxidation and could be easily recovered and reused."

2,Reagents,"2.1 Reagents All chemicals were analytical grade, commercially available and used without further purification unless otherwise stated."
3,Preparation of the catalyst [(C18H37)2(CH3)2N]7[PW11O39],"2.2 Preparation of the catalyst [(C18H37)2(CH3)2N]7[PW11O39] First 30g of Na2WO4·2H2O was dissolved in 37ml of distilled water with stirring. Then 0.75ml of 85% H3PO4, followed by 5.5ml of glacial acetic acid, was added to the stirring solution. After a few seconds the solution became cloudy and after about 1min a heavy white precipitate had formed. The solid was collected and first dried under aspiration for 24h, and then the aspirated solid was left in air for 24h [41]. After that, the solid was dried at 140°C for about 1.5h. Then, 0.56g of the dried solid was dissolved in 55ml of water. To this solution, 0.9g of dioctadecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride dissolved in 10ml of tert-butanol was added slowly. The mixture was stirred vigorously for 4–5h at 40°C. A white solid was filtered off and then washed with an excess amount of water, then dried in vacuum. The yield was 85%. IR spectrum (KBr, cm−1): 1079, 1040, 945, 900, 849, 806, 759, 725, 591, 512, 409. 31P MAS NMR: −10.2ppm. Calcd. for [(C18H37)2(CH3)2N]7[PW11O39]: C, 48.90; H, 8.58; N, 1.50; P, 0.47; W, 30.98. Found: C, 50.03; H, 8.76; N, 1.47; P, 0.43; W, 30.89."
4,Characterization techniques,"2.3 Characterization techniques Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet FTIR-360 FT-IR spectrometer. The catalysts were measured using 2–4% (w/w) KBr pellets prepared by manual grinding. 31P MAS NMR spectra were recorded at 9.4T on a Bruker Avance-400 wide bore spectrometer. The 31P MAS NMR spectra of solid catalyst with high-power proton decoupling were performed at 161.9MHz with BB MAS probe head using 4mm ZrO2 rotors and 3.8μs pulse and 2s repetition time and 4096 scans, with samples spun at 10kHz and referenced to 85% H3PO4. GC analyses were performed on Shimadzu GC-9AM with a flame ionization detector equipped with SE-54 capillary (internal diameter=0.25mm, length=30m). Mass spectra were recorded on Finnigan Trace DSQ (Thermo Electron Corporation) at an ionization voltage of 70eV equipped with a DB-5 capillary column (internal diameter=0.25mm, film thickness=0.25μm, length=30m). Chemical elemental analysis of the catalysts was done on an ICP-atomic emission spectrometer (IRIS ER/S), and C, H, and N contents were measured on a German Elementar Vario EL spectrometer."
5,Catalytic reaction,"2.4 Catalytic reaction Catalyst (8μmol), 1,4-dioxane (2–3ml), substrate (1mmol), and H2O2 (5mmol, 30% aq.) were charged in the reaction flask. The reaction was carried out at proper temperature for 3–7h. After reaction finished with temperature dropping, the catalyst precipitated itself from the solvent. The catalyst was separated by centrifugation and washed with Et2O, which was then used for the next oxidation. The organic products were separated from the aqueous phase by extraction and then the organic layer was analyzed by GC with the internal standard method. Assignments of some products were made by comparison with authentic samples. Selective products were obtained by evaporation or column chromatography and analyzed by IR, melting point, 1H NMR and 13C NMR."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Pyridine oxidation,"3.1 Pyridine oxidation Using the temperature-controlled phase transfer catalyst, we investigated the effect of the solvent on temperature phase transformation for the oxidation of 2-picoline with hydrogen peroxide (Table 1 ). Although the catalyst of [(C18H37)2(CH3)2N]7[PW11O39] was insoluble in most solvents at room temperature, a homogeneous medium was formed in all solvents during the oxidation at reaction temperature (65°C). After the reaction with cooling, the catalyst precipitated gradually from the system in some solvents, including 1,4-dioxane, ethanol, acetonitrile, acetone and ethyl acetate. In contrast, the catalyst was still soluble in toluene and 1,2-dichloroethane when the temperature cooled to the room temperature after reaction. The catalytic results for the oxidation of 2-picoline to 2-picoline-N-oxide under different solvents are also summarized in the table. The oxidation was effectively catalyzed in most solvents investigated in short reaction time, and the N-oxide was the only product. Especially in 1,4-dioxane and 1,2-dichloroethane, excellent yields of the N-oxide were obtained (Table 1, entries 2 and 8). Considering that the catalyst could not be reused in 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,4-dioxane was chosen as the optimal solvent in this catalytic system. In addition, a control experiment was also conducted in 1,4-dioxane with H2O2 in the absence of catalyst. Only 9% yield of the product was observed; indicating the strong activity of the catalyst used in this system. Having obtained these results, we extended our temperature-controlled phase transfer catalytic system to the oxidation of other pyridine derivatives. The results are listed in Table 2 . The yields were high to excellent for some representative substrates in short reaction time such as pyridine, 2-picoline, 4-picoline, quinoline, isoquinoline and 4-methyl-quinoline. Selectivities to the N-oxides were ≥99%. Electron-deficient substrate like 2-chloropyridine was hardly reactive as expected (Table 2, entry 6). Interestingly, 2,6-lutidine was less reactive than other substrates, this should be attributed to the steric considerations. Increasing the reaction time from 3h to 6h led to a good yield in N-oxidation product formation (Table 2, entries 4 and 5). 8-Hydroxyquinoline was also the same case with the steric effect of the –OH group, but an excellent yield (95%) of the desired product was obtained when the reaction time increased to 6h. The catalyst could be easily recycled in this system. Representation of the temperature-controlled phase transfer catalytic system is shown in Fig. 1 . At the beginning of the reaction, the catalyst was insoluble in the solvent of 1,4-dioxane at room temperature. When the oxidation was carried out with heating, the catalyst dissolved in the system gradually. After the reaction finished with the temperature dropping, the system gradually changed from clear to turbid and the catalyst precipitated itself from the system. The catalyst could be separated from the system by centrifugation and used for the next cycle. Table 3 lists the catalytic activity in oxidation of 2-picoline based on [(C18H37)2(CH3)2N]7[PW11O39] for different cycles. As shown in the table, the catalytic activity and selectivity of the recovered catalyst were almost the same as those of the fresh catalyst. A 97% yield of 2-picoline-N-oxide could be achieved even after six cycles, indicating the excellent and stable activity of the catalyst is."
8,Alcohol oxidation,"3.2 Alcohol oxidation Table 4 summarizes the results of catalytic oxidation of various alcohols in water with 30% H2O2 based on [(C18H37)2(CH3)2N]7[PW11O39]. During the reaction with heating, the catalyst dissolved in the system and catalyzed the oxidation of alcohols. As shown in Table 4, several secondary alcohols were successfully oxidized to the corresponding ketones in high conversion and selectivity. Liquid cyclic alcohols, cyclohexanol and cyclopentanol were converted to the corresponding ketones with the 98% and 96% yields, respectively. For linear aliphatic alcohols, it was found that the shorter linear alcohol (2-pentanol) was more active than the longer one (2-octanol) in this oxidation system. A yield of 97% was also obtained in oxidation of the benzylic secondary alcohol (α-phenylethyl alcohol). In some reported systems, the solid alcohols were difficult to oxidize due to physiochemical considerations [35]. However, the solid alcohols of DL-menthol and benzhydrol were oxidized in high yields in this catalytic system. The above results show that this temperature-controlled phase transfer catalytic system is capable of catalytic activity for different kinds of secondary alcohols (hydrophilic alcohols, hydrophobic alcohols and solid alcohols). For primary alcohol, the products in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol were benzaldehyde and benzoic acid. The oxidations of benzyl alcohol based on this catalytic system with different molar ratios of H2O2/benzyl alcohol were investigated in detail. With increasing H2O2/substrate molar ratio, the conversion of benzyl alcohol increased accordingly, but the selectivity of benzaldehyde decreased. It was found that the amount of hydrogen peroxide could affect the activity and selectivity in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol in this oxidation system. Increasing amount of hydrogen peroxide enhanced the activity of oxidation, but the excess of oxidant promoted the deep oxidation, which would produce more benzoic acid. The catalyst could be also easily recycled in this system. At the beginning of the reaction, the catalyst was insoluble in the solvent of 1,4-dioxane at room temperature. When the oxidation was carried out with heating, the catalyst dissolved in the system gradually. After the reaction finished with the temperature dropping, the system gradually changed from clear to turbid and the catalyst precipitated by itself from the system. The catalyst could be separated from the system by centrifugation and used for the next cycle. Table 5 lists the catalytic activity in oxidation of cyclohexanol and 2-octanol based on [(C18H37)2(CH3)2N]7[PW11O39] for different cycles. As shown in the table, the catalytic activity and selectivity of the recovered catalyst were the same as those of the fresh catalyst. For cyclic alcohol of cyclohexanol, after three cycles, a 97% yield of cyclohexanone with 99% selectivity was obtained. For linear aliphatic alcohol of 2-octanol, a 90% yield of octanone with 99% selectivity was still kept, indicating the excellent and stable activity of the catalyst. The oxidation of 2-octanol under different solvents was investigated and shown in Table 6 , several trends may be noted. The catalyst was all soluble in these solvents during the reaction. However, after the oxidation with temperature dropping, the catalyst precipitated from the system in 1,4-dioxane, acetonitrile and ethyl acetate, but dissolved in toluene and 1,2-dichloroethane. The polarity of 1,4-dioxane, acetonitrile and ethyl acetate is stronger than that of toluene and 1,2-dichloroethane. So we presume that the strong polarity of solvent may be helpful for the property of temperature-controlled phase transfer catalysis. Compared to the activity of the catalyst in oxidation of 2-octanol during the polar solvents, high conversion of 93% and 96% was obtained in acetonitrile and 1,4-dioxane, respectively. Considering the strong toxicity of acetonitrile, 1,4-dioxane was chosen as the best solvent in this system from the viewpoint of green chemistry. The solubility of the catalyst in the reaction solution for the oxidation of cyclohexanol was determined during different temperatures (Table 7 ). From 20°C to 45°C, the catalyst was insoluble in the system. When the reaction temperature reached 48°C, the catalyst started to dissolve. The system became clear gradually with heating continually, and the catalyst was dissolved completely at 53°C. The catalyst was always soluble in the solution at 55–85°C. To well prove that this system indeed has the character of temperature-controlled phase transfer catalysis, the effect of temperature on the solubility of catalyst in the oxidation is shown in Table 8 . The catalyst was insoluble in 1,4-dioxane without substrate and H2O2 at room temperature (entry 1). But it dissolved gradually in the solvent after heating and precipitated from the system with cooling. The catalyst could effectively oxidize substrates in a homogeneous system and easily be recycled by changing the temperature. This catalytic system is very different from the reaction-controlled phase transfer catalytic systems which were reported before [27,28,42]. In that system, when the deficient H2O2 was consumed up, the catalyst could be recovered from the reaction system by centrifugation. However, the important factor for the recovery of the catalyst in our system is not the H2O2 but the temperature. As shown in the table, the amount of H2O2 was added from 1mmol to 10mmol; the catalyst could precipitate in any case from the solvent after the reaction with the temperature dropping. Whether the olefin was added or not, and whether the H2O2 was equivalent or excessive, the catalyst all had the temperature-controlled phase transfer characters. The results proved that this system is indeed a temperature-controlled phase transfer catalytic system. The fresh catalyst and recovered catalysts were characterized with FT-IR spectra and 31P MAS NMR. As shown in Fig. 2 , the IR spectrum of the fresh catalyst exhibited characteristic peaks at 1079–1040, 945 and 900–725cm−1 which were attributed to ν (P–O), ν (WO) and ν (W–O–W), respectively [43]. There were some differences between the IR spectrum of the fresh catalyst and the first used one. An obvious peak at 840cm−1 was appeared for the latter, which was attributed to ν (O–O) [44]. There was also a strong peak at 844cm−1 in the IR spectrum of the catalyst of cycle 2, which was similar with the catalyst of cycle 1. The 31P MAS NMR spectra of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . A single peak at −10.2ppm is shown in Fig. 1a, it should be attributed to the lacunary structure of [PW11O39]7− [45]. The spectrum of the used catalyst (Fig. 3b) shows several broad peaks and suggests that the catalyst is a mixture that contains several different polytungstophosphate species. The main peak at 2.7ppm can be attributed to active tungsten-peroxo complex, which is consistent with the IR spectrum. The peaks at −1.6 and −4.6ppm should be other low W/P polytungstophosphate species. The 31P MAS NMR spectrum of the catalyst of cycle 2 (Fig. 3c) was similar to that of cycle 1, indicating that the structure of the pre-catalyst would not change from the first cycle. According to the above characterization results, we proposed a possible mechanism for the oxidation of alcohols in this temperature-controlled phase transfer catalysis system. When the reaction was heated and H2O2 was added to the solution of catalyst, the fresh structure of [PW11O39]7− became a mixture of polytungstophosphate species. These species could be exchanged to each other in solution, and finally formed the peroxo tungstophosphate intermediate, which was active and responsible for the oxidation. After the oxidation finished, the catalyst changed back to the mixture of polytungstophosphate species. These species have the temperature-controlled phase transfer property under the effect of unique solvent and the special big cation, and can be recycled for the oxidation without changes of structure."
9,Conclusions,"In summary, a recyclable, effective, and stable catalytic system has been developed for the oxidation of pyridines and alcohols to the corresponding N-oxides and ketones based on a temperature-controlled phase transfer catalyst of [(C18H37)2(CH3)2N]7[PW11O39]. High to excellent yields were achieved. After reaction with cooling, the catalyst precipitated from the system and could be recovered by centrifugation as deposit. There was no discernible loss in activity or selectivity after several cycles."
