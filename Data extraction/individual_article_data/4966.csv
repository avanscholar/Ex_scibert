0,Introduction,"Renewable sources are getting increased attention in the last decades, due to the initiative of developing sustainable technologies, as a result of fossil fuel depletion and increased energy and chemical demands. Lignocellulosic biomass is a sustainable source, which can be valorized, into valuable chemicals and energy vectors. It is composed mostly from hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin. Furfural (FUR) is a platform chemical, derived from hemicellulose and can be produced by acid-catalyzed dehydration of its C5 sugars (for instance xylose) [1,2]. FUR is already produced in large quantities [3] and is considered to be among the most important biomass-derived platform chemicals [4,5]. It can be further converted into various valuable products for different applications in fuel, polymer, cosmetic, chemical, pharmaceutical and other industries [6–12]. One of the desirable FUR dehydrogenation products is tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), as it can be used for synthesis of fine chemicals and as a green, less toxic solvent for industrial applications, which is degradable, but more stable than unsaturated furanic solvents [7,13,14]. It can also be converted into other high value chemicals, such as dihydropyran, pyridine, tetrahydrofuran, 1,5-pentanedion and 1,2-pentanedion, which are all industrially important molecules [15]. Different heterogeneous catalysts have proven to be efficient for FUR hydrogenation, hydrodeoxygenation or decarbonylation, in the presence of a hydrogen source [16,17]. Hydrogen gas and/or hydrogen donor solvent can be used. Ni-based catalysts (NiB/SiO2 [13], Ni/TiO2-ZrO2 [18], Ni-Pd/SiO2 [19] and CuNi/MgAlO [20]) have proven to be selective towards conversion of FUR to THFA, but leach in liquid phase reactions [20]. Pd-based catalysts were found to be more stable and high selectivity towards hydro(deoxy)genation can be achieved [15]. Various single metal Pd catalysts, supported on MFI, SiO2, Al2O3, C, TiO2-ZrO2, TiO2, Hydroxyapatite, MgO or Fe2O3 [15,18,21–25] and bimetallic Pd-X catalysts (X = Ir, Ru, Rh, Pt, Ni, Cu), supported on SiO2, MFI, Al2O3, C or TiO2-ZrO2 [18,19,23,26] have been tested. Thiol modifiers were also used to identify the role of specific adsorption sites on Pd/Al2O3 [27]. With the use of Pd catalyst supported on hydroxyapatite, close to 100% yields were achieved at mild conditions (1 MPa H2, 40 °C, 3 h) in isopropanol (IPRO) [15]. Contrary to Cu based catalyst, which favor CO bond adsorption [28], Pd and Pt catalysts are known for its high selectivity towards FUR ring hydrogenation at low temperatures, as they have a high affinity for CC bond adsorption, leading to flat orientation of FUR at low furfural and hydrogen coverage, yielding THFA [29–31]. However, the selectivity on such catalysts was not only found to be influenced by the chosen support, size and shape of metal particles, but also by hydrogen pressure (influencing surface coverage), leading either to hydrogenation, hydrodeoxygenation or decarbonylation products, such as furfuryl alcohol (FA), tetrahydrofurfural (THFUR), THFA, 2-methylfuran (MF), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF), furan and tetrahydrofuran (THF) [32–34]. However in addition to catalyst design, hydrogen surface coverage can also be influenced by other external conditions in addition to hydrogen pressure, such as gas phase composition, mass transfer rate (mixing speed or gas flow rate), chemical environment and hydrogen solubility (choice of solvent), solvent – FUR ratio, FUR – catalyst ratio and others. Another important note to consider is catalyst poisoning. Decarbonylation, which occurs at elevated temperatures (230–300 °C) on Pd catalysts, leads to CO formation, which strongly adsorbs on the metal surface and was found to desorbed only at high temperatures (at 280 °C for Pt based catalysts), thus poisoning it, making the decarbonylation route less desirable [29–31]. On the other side, deactivation on Pd/TiO2 catalysts was found to be a result of Pd carbide formation, which is more pronounced at lower temperatures (25 °C) as a result of Pd-Pd distance expansion, which hinders FUR adsorption and affects hydrogen dissociation [21]. Although Pd is highly active even at room temperature, intermediate temperatures should be used to avoid poisoning. As a result, we have conducted a micro-kinetic study at intermediate temperatures. Different methods, based on first-principle data have already been developed for calculation of gas phase reactions, such as CO and NO oxidation or methane steam reforming, on the catalyst surface [35]. Also, more complex systems for conversion of biomass molecules by acid hydrolysis [36–38] or by using heterogeneous catalysts [32,33,39–45] have been studied [46]. However, first-principle parameters are usually calculated in ideal systems (vacuum, gas phase, 0 K) and also, adsorption and desorption rates in the literature are found primarily for gas phase reactions. Only a few similar reactions were studied for FUR conversion by using mechanistic modelling approach, usually studying the effect of one variable, such as hydrogen coverage, metal particle shape and size or by developing a detailed mechanism, studied by DFT in combination with a few experimental points [32,33,43–45]. However, various reaction conditions must be taken into account. Mass transport phenomena can also greatly influence the selectivity of such reactions for multiple catalysts [33,34,45–48] and should be incorporated in such models. As there is no single answer, a systematic approach is needed. There are many variables influencing such reactions, such as thermodynamics (hydrogen solubility), initial conditions, temperature, pressure, choice of solvent, catalyst and hydrogen source, catalyst mass (concentration of active sites), and also mass transfer phenomena, which is especially important for H2 transport from gas to liquid phase, influencing catalyst surface coverage. All these variables were sequentially studied through various experimental tests in a three phase batch reactor at temperatures up to 200 °C and pressures up to 75 bar, while using gas H2 or N2, liquid FUR as the main reactant and 2-propanol or tetrahydrofuran as a solvent with Pd/C commercial solid catalyst. Furthermore, a mechanistic kinetic model was developed, which offers deeper insight, unraveling the mechanics and providing guidelines towards tuning the selectivity also on a larger scale."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The chemical and gasses were all purchased from commercial suppliers and were used as supplied. Furfural (99%, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA, reference number 185914), furfuryl alcohol (98% Aldrich chemistry, Saint Louis, MO, USA, reference number 185930). and hydrogen (5.0, Messer, Gumpoldskirchen, Austria) were used as the main reactants, isopropanol for analysis (≥99.5%, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, reference number 1070222511) and tetrahydrofuran for analysis (≥99.8%, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, reference number 1097312500) were used as solvents and nitrogen (5.0, Messer, Gumpoldskirchen, Austria) was used for inert atmosphere tests and to flush the gas mixture in the reactor before and after experiments. Beside blank runs with activated carbon (p. a., Alkaloid – Skopje, North Macedonia), a commercial 5% palladium on activated carbon catalyst (Degussa, type E190 NW/W with 50% water content) was used for all heterogeneous reactions, which was dried overnight at 110 °C in an oven before it was used. Isopropanol (same as for the reaction) or acetone (≥99.5% Honeywell Riedel-de Haën™, St. Louis, MO, USA, reference number 179124) with addition of tert–butylbenzene (>99%, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, reference number 1421537) as internal standard were used for dilution of liquid samples prior to GC-FID/MS analysis. Furfural (same as for reaction), furfuryl alcohol (same as for reaction), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (98%, Aldrich chemistry, Saint Louis, MO, USA, reference number T12653), 2-methylfuran anhydrous (≥99%, Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA, reference number M46845) and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran anhydrous (≥99%, Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA, reference number 414247) were used for external calibration."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The solid catalyst was analyzed by using PANalytical X’Pert PRO instrument to perform X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis with CuKα (5 kW, 45 mA) radiation source (λ = 0.154056 nm) and Ni filter (for adsorption of Kβ radiation), while scanning in the 2 ϕ range of 5–90°, while using a minimum step size 0.001°. The used catalyst (Run 11) was taken after the reaction, washed with acetone and dried at 110 °C in an oven prior to analysis, while the fresh catalyst was only dried. Catalyst surface properties were analyzed by using an ASAP 2020 gas adsorption instrument (Micrometrics, Norcross, GA, USA). Nitrogen adsorption – desorption isotherms were used to determine catalyst surface properties, such as BET specific surface area (S BET), pore volume (V P) and average pore diameter (d p). To determine active sites on the catalyst surface, Micrometrics AutoChem II Chemisorption Analyser (Micrometrics, Norcross, GA, USA) was used for temperature programme desorption with carbon monoxide (CO-TPD) and ammonia (NH3-TPD). To reduce the sample (TPR), it was heated up to 105 °C with a rate of 20 °C min−1 of argon and kept 30 min at set temperature. The sample was than cooled to −40 °C and held five minutes before 20 mL min−1 of 5 vol% H2 in Ar was introduced. After baseline stabilisation, the sample was heated up 5 °C min−1 up to 500 °C and kept 10 min at that temperature and then reduced to room temperature. To determine the surface concentration of metallic sites, CO-TPD measurement was performed by purging the reduced sample with 50 mL min−1 of 5 vol% CO in He with a heat-up ramp of 10 °C min−1 up to 150 °C, at which it was kept for 30 min and then cooled down to −40 °C and purged with pure He at the end to set the baseline. A heat-up ramp of 5 K min−1 reached 900 °C and was subsequently kept constant for 10 min. To evaluate the surface concentration of acidic sites, NH3-TPD was used. Reduced samples were flushed with 10 vol% NH3 in He at flow rate 50 mL min−1. After 60 min, only He was used to flow through the sample till the baseline was reached. Afterwards, the sample was heated with a heat up ramp of 5 K min−1 up to 500 °C with a 10 min plateau at set temperature. A Supra 35VP microscope by Carl-Zeiss was used for field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) to determine the catalyst morphology."
4,Experimental procedure,"2.3 Experimental procedure The hydrogenation experiments were performed in a batch three-phase reactor system (Amar) with 250 mL cylindrical stainless steel reactor vessels, equipped with Rushton turbine impeller with diameter 30 mm, positioned 25 mm above the bottom of reactor, which was magnetically driven. Temperature was regulated with a heating jacked and a cooling system with water through SCADA software with on-line temperature and pressure measurements. Liquid samples were collected directly from the reactor system during the reaction through the equipped sampling tubes. After the experiment was finished, the reaction mixture was cooled down and flushed with nitrogen. In a typical experiment, 10 g of FUR, 90 g of solvent and 600 mg of catalyst were weighted individually and added directly into the reaction vessel, which was then closed. The reactor was flushed twice with nitrogen and once with hydrogen, before the hydrogen was finally added to reach the required pressure for the experiment. Various parameters, such as temperature (up to 200 °C), pressure (25–75 bar), mixing speed (100–1000 min−1), choice of solvent (no solvent, isopropanol or tetrahydrofuran) were varied, as shown in Table 1 . Catalytic activity tests were performed by following a prescribed heating profile, where the reaction mixture was heated-up from room temperature to three sequential temperature plateau (125, 150 and 175 °C), maintained for 70 min each for all preliminary (Runs 1–9) and pressure-screening tests (Runs 17 to 19 and 27 to 29). For isothermal temperature tests, the reaction mixture was heated-up from room temperature to single 4 h temperature plateau (100 °C, 125 °C, 150 °C, 175 °C and 200 °C) for runs 10 to 14 in THF and 20 to 24 in IPRO. Stirring-speed tests were performed with a heat-up ramp from room temperature to 200 °C, the final temperature was maintained for 4 h (Runs 14 to 15 for THF and 24 to 26 for IPRO). Reusability tests were conducted in THF and IPRO solvents for 4 h at 175 °C by using 50 bar H2 with 600 rpm stirring speed. A liquid sample was taken at the end of each run. Afterwards, the catalyst was separated by centrifugation and washed with the solvent 3 times. The catalyst was reused in the next run without prior pre- or re-activation. To follow the mass balance, sample vials, waste bottle, filters, empty and full reactor were weighted prior and after the experiment."
5,Sample analysis and catalyst characterization,"2.4 Sample analysis and catalyst characterization Liquid samples were collected during the reaction, filtered, and diluted 20 times with acetone. Sample analysis was performed off-line by using gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector (GC/FID) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for quantitative analysis, which was also coupled with mass spectrometer detector (GC/MS) (2010 Ultra, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) for identification. A Zebron ZB-5 ms capillary column (60 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) was used. All concentrations were normalized according to initial (weighted) FUR (or FA in Runs 8 and 9) concentration."
6,Micro-kinetic model development,
7,Reaction pathway network and micro-kinetic model development,"3.1 Reaction pathway network and micro-kinetic model development A mathematical model was developed, based on a predesigned reaction pathway network, shown in Fig. 1 , where additional interactions/reactions with IPRO solvent are shown in brown color. The reaction pathway was developed based on numerous catalytic tests (Table 1), including all the molecules identified with GC–MS. Either FUR aldehyde group (k 1) or ring (k 2) can first undergo hydrogenation (yielding FA or THFUR), followed by total hydrogenation through k 3 or k 4 (yielding THFA) and deoxygenation of alcohol group through k 5 or k 6 (yielding MF or MTHF), followed by total hydrogenation in case of MF formation (k 7). Oligomerisation of FUR (k 8), THFUR (k 9), FA (k 10) and THFA (k 11) was also considered possible. On basis of quantitative and qualitative GC-FID/MS data from tests with IPRO, reversible etherification reactions of IPRO with FUR (k 12 and k 13), FA (k 14 and k 15), THFUR (k 16 and k 17) or THFA (k 18 and k 19) were observed, yielding 2-(diisopropoxymethyl) furan (FURDIPE), 2-(isopropoxymethyl) furan (FURIPE), 2-(diisopropoxymethyl) tetrahydrofuran (THFMDIPE) and 2-isopropoxymethyl) tetrahydrofuran (THFMIPE) as proposed in Fig. 1. Also additional hydrogen formation from IPRO (k 20) was accounted for, as IPRO is a known hydrogen donor solvent. Albilali et al. [25] also proposed furfural to be converted either through FA or THFUR intermediate by using IPRO. The pathway through FA was, by using Pd on different supports, also suggested by various studies [18,21,23,49]. On basis of dispersion-corrected DFT calculations, Voratnikov et al. [30] proposed the preferred pathway of FUR hydrogenation to FA through hydrogenation of carbonyl oxygen and subsequent carbon hydrogenation. Also, the preferred path to MF was found to occur through FA. These results are consistent with DFT calculations of Pang and Medlin [31] and with our proposed reaction pathway network. Furan was also proposed to form directly from furfural, but was not detected in our experiments and was therefore excluded. It was recently reported by Yang et al. [50] that selective FUR ring hydrogenation can be achieved by using Pd/LDH-MgAl-NO3 in water, yielding THFUR with high selectivity (up to 92.6%). They showed the choice of solvent and support to greatly influence hydrogen spillover and furfural adsorption properties, leading to FUR ring and/or CO hydrogenation. Smaller yields of THFUR were achieved by using various solvents, including THF and ethanol or by using different supports (SiO2, ZrO2, TiO2), while THFUR, FA and THFA were formed in all cases. Ring hydrogenation was shown to occur on Pd surface while LDH-MgAl-NO3 support and water prevented hydrogenation of the CO group. We have also identified all these products by GC–MS and suggest both pathways to be possible in our case. Mass transfer and dissolution of hydrogen gas in the liquid phase based on gas-liquid equilibrium, adsorption and desorption of each species to the solid catalyst surface, homogeneous reactions in the liquid phase and surface reactions on the catalyst surface were all accounted for in the model. The model was coded in Matlab software by solving a set of differential equations (numerically using an integrated ode15s Matlab solver), resulting in transient concentration profiles and surface coverages. All the kinetic parameters were estimated by the regression analysis using Nelder–Mead method for multiple experiments simultaneously with the objective function (sum of squared residuals) minimization. The model is based on following modelling- and experimentally- based assumptions: • At the start of the reaction, hydrogen pressure is equal to total pressure in the reactor vessel at ambient temperature. This is a result of high hydrogen pressure and relatively low volatility of reaction mixture components at room temperature. • Hydrogen solubility in IPRO [51] and THF [52] was estimated by using adapted Henry’s law constant, which is temperature and pressure dependent and is, based on the literature, valid in this experimental range. • Eley — Rideal mechanism was used for hydrogenation, deoxygenation and oligomerisation of unsaturated furanics (reactions k 1, k 5 and k 8), which react with dissolved hydrogen. Langmuir — Hinschelwood mechanism was selected for other surface reactions, since, according to literature, CC bond adsorption of furanic molecules is preferred [29–31]. As a result, it is speculated, that unsaturated furanic molecules adsorb to the metallic surface sites with the ring, while the aldehyde group predominantly faces towards the liquid phase. • All molecules from the liquid phase can competitively and independently adsorb and desorb to/from the metallic surface sites. In practice, they can also adsorb and desorb to/from the support, but this was neglected as these sites were proved not to be catalytically active with the experiment on C. • One adsorbed molecule was considered to cover one surface site. The number of available surface metallic sites was calculated based on CO-TPD measurement. • All hydrogenation reactions occur on metallic surface sites, as negligible hydrogenation products were observed in absence of Pd (Run 6). • Decarbonylation products were not observed, therefore this reaction was neglected. Also, noticeable decarbonylation occurs only above the tested temperature range according to literature data [29]. Furthermore the mass balance closure of at least 85.7 wt% in THF and 93.2 wt% in IPRO was observed event at the highest tested temperatures (200 °C). • All identified oligomers and unidentified peaks with high retention indexes were grouped as one lump - oligomers (OLIG). • Oligomerization occurs only on metal sites between FUR molecules in the presence of hydrogen. No or minimum oligomerization products was observed in the absence of catalyst (Run 1, 2), hydrogen (Run 3), or FUR (Run 8) by using THF as a solvent. Therefore, oligomerization was assumed to occur only in the co-presence of them all. However, in case of using IPRO as a solvent, OLIG were also detected in the absence of catalyst (Run 4) or hydrogen (Run 7). Also negligible OLIG concentration was observed while using FA as initial reactant in both solvents (Runs 8 and 9). As all hydrogenation products (FA, THFUR, THFA) were present in FA hydrogenation tests, their oligomerization was also negligible. Also, minimal oligomerization was observed when FUR without a solvent (Run 5) was used. • IPRO solvent can react with FUR, FA, THFUR or THFA to form furfuryl ethers in bulk liquid. The reaction is reversible. • IPRO can be dehydrogenated on the catalyst surface to form hydrogen and acetone. IPRO is the most well-known hydrogen donor. • As variable mass loss (4.0–14.3 wt%) was observed in individual experiments, while estimating carbon balance, all the concentrations were normalized to initial concentration of added reactants (FUR or FA), for the sake of regression analysis. The temperature measurements were used in the model for estimation of kinetic, hydrogen adsorption and desorption rate constants at each time increment. The hydrogenation surface reaction rates ( r i s ), which follow Langmuir — Hinshelwood mechanism are described in Eq. (1) and were calculated as a product of kinetic rate constant ( k i ), which is temperature (T) dependent, surface coverage of specie j ( θ j ) and surface coverage of hydrogen ( θ H 2 ). Surface coverages have a value between 0 (no surface coverage) and 1 (total surface coverage).*** (1) r i s t , T = k i T · θ j t · θ H 2 t For calculation of reaction rates, which are formulated according to Eley — Rideal mechanism ( r i s , l ), such as hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation of unsaturated furanics (Eq. (2)), dissolved hydrogen in the liquid phase ( C H 2 l ) is used instead of surface hydrogen. (2) r i s , l t , T = k i ( T ) · θ j t · C H 2 l t Oligomerisation was assumed to occur on the metallic sites and also follows either Langmuir — Hinshelwood mechanism (Eq. (1)) or Eley — Rideal mechanism (Eq. (2)) for oligomerisation of unsaturated furanics. In addition, catalytic hydrogen and acetone formation from isopropanol was calculated according to Equation (3) in case of using IPRO as solvent according to Langmuir — Hinshelwood mechanism. Adsorbed IPRO ( θ IPRO ) and a surface vacant site ( θ vs ) are required for hydrogen formation. As acetone was assumed to be chemically inert, it was not included in mass balance equations. (3) r i s t , T = k i T · θ IPRO ( t ) · θ vs ( t ) The homogenous reaction rates ( r i l ) for etherification reactions (Eq. (4)) with IPRO were defined as a product of kinetic rate constant ( k i ), which is temperature (T) dependent, concentration of specie j in the liquid phase C j l and concentration of solvent C IPRO l . (4) r i l ( t , T ) = k i T · C j l ( t ) · C IPRO l ( t ) Reversible reactions (Eq. (5)) have the form: (5) r i l ( t , T ) = k i T · C j l ( t ) In the equation, j represents one of furfuryl ethers (FURDIPE, FURIPE, THFMDIPE or THFMIPE). The availability of all vacant sites ( n cat ) was calculated as a product of catalyst mass ( m cat ) and number of active sites ( N as ( C O )), obtained independently from CO-TPD data (Eq. (6)). (6) n cat = m cat · N as ( C O ) The adsorption rate of each specie ( r j ad ) on vacant sites ( θ vs ) was defined as in Eq. (7) (7) r j ad t , T = k j ad ( T ) · C j l t · θ vs t k j ad is the adsorption rate constant and was chosen to be temperature independent, which is usually the case, except for hydrogen which is known to be temperature dependent [53,54]. In contrast all the desorption rates ( r j des ) are temperature dependent and were calculated according to Eq. (8). (8) r j des t , T = k j des T · θ j t The reaction rate constants ( k i ) and desorption rate constants ( k j des ) were assumed to be temperature dependent and were calculated according to the Arrhenius equation for each specie j, by taking activation energy ( Ea i ) into account (Eq. (9)). T ref is a reference temperature for the kinetic rate constant k i T ref and has a chosen value of 100 °C. (9) k i T = k i ( T ref ) · exp - Ea i R · 1 T - 1 T ref The equilibrium concentration of hydrogen in THF [52] or IPRO [51] was calculated (Eqs. (10) and (11)) by using an adapted Henry’s constant ( He i ), which is in bar units. Hence, Eq. (10) is multiplied by a factor of 10 due to unit conversion. Mass transfer rate of hydrogen from gas to liquid phase ( r H 2 GL ) was calculated according to film theory (Eq. (12)). Since pure hydrogen was used in the gas phase, only liquid phase mass transfer coefficient ( k l ) was used, which was fitted in the model together with bubble surface area ( a g ) as one parameter ( k l a g ). C 0 is the sum of all initial concentrations of solvent and furanics.

(16)), according to reaction scheme (Fig. 1). V g and V l represent the volume of gas and liquid phase. Two hydrogen molecules are used for ring hydrogenation reactions, while one hydrogen molecule is used in other hydrogenation reactions, hydrodeoxygenation and oligomerisation reactions. Two furfural (or FA, THFUR, THFA) molecules react to form one OLIG molecule on average. n i is used to describe the molar balance ratio. The reaction rate r i s , l is used for hydrogen consumption in the liquid phase and for other species on the catalyst surface.

8,Initial conditions and parameter estimation procedure,"3.2 Initial conditions and parameter estimation procedure Initial concentrations were set to values, obtained by GC-FID analysis of the first sample taken in each run prior to start of reaction protocol. The obtained concentration values were than normalized according to initial concentration of liquid FUR (or FA in Runs 8 and 9), which was weighted prior to reaction. All initial surface coverage values were set to zero. Starting pressure of added hydrogen (nitrogen) gas and temperature was taken from online measurements in the reactor at starting time of the experiment. The following procedure was used for experiments, when THF was used as a solvent. Due to many kinetic and mass transfer parameters, a systematical fitting procedure was applied. First, hydrogen gas-liquid transfer rate ( k l a g ) was estimated, based on measured total pressure drop in absence of catalyst at start of Run 2. Also, all the kinetic parameters were set to zero. The adsorption rates were assumed to be temperature independent with same values assigned for all species. These rates were than set to values high enough, not to limit mass transport or reaction rates. Kinetic rate constants for desorption were assigned based on reasonable surface coverage at reference temperature. It should be noted, that in the literature, only gas phase adsorption and desorption rates coefficients can be found, which are not directly comparable for liquid phase. All the kinetic rate constants were then fitted at an assigned reference temperature ( T ref = 100 °C). Activation energies for each reaction were than sequentially fitted at different temperatures. The parameter k l a g was fitted for each stirring speed afterwards. Kinetic rate constants and activation energies were again readjusted by fitting varying experimental tests."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Catalyst characterization,"4.1 Catalyst characterization In situ reduction of PdO in the liquid phase was performed during the reaction, as it is evident from the XRD of the used catalyst in Run 12 (Fig. 2 a) in comparison with the diffractogram of fresh catalyst, where most of the metal phase was oxidized. The majority of the used catalyst represents the Pd(111) crystal plane, followed by Pd(200), Pd(311) and Pd(202). SEM image of the fresh Pd/C catalyst is shown in Fig. 2b. Measured surface properties are collected in Table 2 . N2 physisorption data provides information about BET total surface area (S BET), total pore volume (V pores) and average pore width (d pores). By using NLDFT method, the majority of pore volume (98.6%) and total area in pores (99.9%) was found to be within pores, smaller than 15 nm, while 56% of pore volume and 76% total area in pores smaller than 2 nm. This makes the catalyst mostly micro- and also meso-porous. H2-TPD desorption showed, that the majority of hydrogen (that saturated all the vacant sites at −40 °C) desorbs from the catalyst surface at temperatures between 25 and 50 °C [55]. By conducting furfural - TPD, Pang and Medlin [31] showed a broad furfural desorption peak, ranging from −13 °C to 187 °C due to multiple adsorption states, peaking at 92 °C. CO-TPD data was used to estimate the total quantity of adsorbed CO molecules (N AS(CO)), which was assumed to be equal to one adsorption site in the model·NH3-TPD was performed to estimate the concentration of acidic sites (N AS(NH3)), which is 4.3 times higher than that of metallic sites. This is a result of additional acid sites present on activated carbon support. Although these sites can act as adsorption sites, no relevant activity was observed through catalytic tests (Run 6). Karakurt et al. [56] showed NH3-TPD profile on clean Pd(111) with desorption peaks at 127 K, 165 K and 279 K, leading to the conclusion, that NH3 is more weakly adsorbed on metallic sites. Our NH3-TPD signal was measured above this temperature range. Therefore, we believe the majority of measured acidic sites to be present on the support. Also, Trung et al. [57] compared NH3-TPD profiles of Pd supported on different carbon supports (activated carbon, graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes). They showed the number of acidic sites to be highly dependent on the choice of support."
11,Liquid sample analysis,"4.2 Liquid sample analysis All the products observed in Fig. 1 were identified by using GC–MS and quantified by using GC-FID analysis. Although molecules, such as 2,2′-difurylmethane, difurfuryl ether and 2-furfuryl-5-methylfuran were detected, there were multiple other unknown peaks with higher mass and were grouped as one variable OLIG. Polymerization or oligomerisation of FUR are known side reactions in reductive environment, especially when furan ring hydrogenation is slow. The complex polymerization mechanism of furanic species was studied by Lund and co-workers in more detail, highlighting hydration of 5-methylfurfural (HMF) to be the key step followed by aldol condensation, which should also be the case for FUR [58,59]. Various reaction mechanisms of furanic compounds reduction were reviewed by Nakagawa et al. [29]. FA polymerization was proposed to form through acid-catalyzed Friedel-Crafts type reaction, linking two furan rings with methylene groups at 2- and 5- positions of the ring [60]. Furfural can also undergo similar, but slower reaction, which undergoes acid-catalyzed additions of alcohols, producing dimers bridged with a hydroxyl-methylene structure, leaving a reactive alcohol group for further Friedel-Crafts type reaction, producing trimers [61,62]. Diels-Alder cycloaddition of furan ring was also found possible, which could be enhanced in presence of acidic catalyst [63]. Although decarbonylation products (such as furan or THF) or ring opening products (n-butanol or pentane diols) are possible, they were not observed by GC-FID/MS analysis. Furan might not be observed during the GC analysis due to its high volatility (the peak might be hidden behind the solvent peak), but this reaction can only occur at the highest tested temperatures (200 °C) according to literature observation [22], where some furan formation was observed above 180 °C in IPRO solvent and became dominant only at higher temperatures (>240 °C) on Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. In case of using THF as the solvent, its formation during the reaction does not pose any problem, as any additional separation steps are not needed and could even substitute the solvent losses."
12,Kinetic and mass transfer parameters,"4.3 Kinetic and mass transfer parameters Adsorption (k ad,i) rate constants were found to be suitable to fit well to the experimental data, when set (at least) to 1 · 10 7 min−1, with the desorption rate constants of (k des,i = 5000 × k ad,i), i.e. 5 · 10 10 min−1, for all species. In Run 3 and 7 (inert N2 atmosphere), desorption rate constants for nitrogen was found to be as low as 2 · 10 8 min−1 so the catalyst surface was saturated with it and inhibited any hydrogen formation on the surface, as negligible catalytic activity was observed in those tests. Mass transfer parameter k l a g was determined by the regression analysis for each stirring speed ( 1.879 · 10 - 2 mol m−3 min−1 at 100 min−1, 6.754 · 10 - 2 mol m−3 min−1 at 600 min−1 and 1.120 · 10 - 1 mol m−3 min−1 at 1000 min−1). Values were suitable to match the model with the experimental results for both solvents. Other parameters were estimated as reported in Table 3 . After all the parameters in THF were estimated, the same parameters were used for runs with IPRO, while only the adapted He constant was different to account for the difference in hydrogen solubility in order to be able to compare the kinetics between those two solvents. Also, additional hydrogen was produced, while using IPRO. The maximum turnover frequency (TOF) was determined at 100 °C for each solvent. Based on TPD results, which showed lower temperature of H2 desorption (25 to 50 °C) [55] compared to that of furfural (peaking at 92 °C) [31] and based on lower activation energy for furfural ring hydrogenation (Ea2 = 19.1 kJ mol−1) compared to aldehyde group hydrogenation (Ea1 = 23.5 kJ mol−1), we suggest ring hydrogenation to be favored at low temperatures."
13,Variation of process conditions,"4.4 Variation of process conditions Process conditions, such as the effect of used solvent or its absence (solventless FUR used), gas type (H2, N2) and pressure, absence of metal and the catalyst were investigated by comparing Runs 1–7. No significant reactions were observed while heating-up solventless FUR (Run 1, Figure S.2a) or while using THF as a solvent in the absence of a catalyst (Run 2, Figure S.2b) or H2 (Run 3, Fig. 3 b). In other preliminary runs (Runs 4–7), some products were formed. In case, when IPRO was used as a solvent and H2 gas in the absence of catalyst (Run 4), etherification and some oligomerisation was observed at all temperatures, while minor FA formation was observed at 175 °C (Figure S.2c). Aldehyde group hydrogenation (11.1% FA) was observed while using solventless FUR with Pd/C catalyst (Run 5, Fig. 3a). Also, minor deoxygenation (0.5% MF) and oligomerisation (2.3% OLIG) were observed at higher temperatures. However as FUR was abundant, FA was the dominant product as a result of hydrogen deficit with a limited rate of hydrogen solubility. Solventless furfural hydrogenation ( k 1 a n d k 2 ) and oligomerisation ( k 8 ) rates were found to be described with the same kinetic parameters as if THF solvent was used. Surprisingly much higher FUR availability in the liquid phase and the same kinetic parameters with nearly the same TOF’s were obtained as in the experiments with THF solvent (Table 3). However, two to three order lower TOF values were determined for subsequent hydrogenation reactions ( k 3 , k 4 , k 5 , k 6 , k 7 ) due to relatively low surface availability of hydrogen. Although hydrogen mass-transfer parameters was not optimized especially for solventless FUR, the model fits the experimental data (Fig. 3a) well. We can conclude that the selection of solventless furfural hydrogenation or addition of a chemically inert solvent, such as THF does not alter the hydrogenation rates or reaction mechanisms on the catalyst surface significantly. Other preliminary runs with carbon support or absence of hydrogen (Runs 6 and 7, Fig. 3d, e) showed almost no reactivity (<0.3% FA and < 0.7% OLIG) in IPRO solvent beside etherification of FUR with IPRO. New compounds were observed as a result of proton donor properties of the IPRO solvent and its interaction with FUR, forming ethers (up to 12.2% FURDIPE) and oligomers (up to 6.1% OLIG) in the bulk liquid phase (Figure S1). Although formation of ethers and oligomers were observed while using active carbon (up to 21.3% FURDIPE and 10.7% OLIG, Fig. 3d) or Pd/C catalyst in absence of hydrogen (up to 17.1% FURDIPE and 8.6% OLIG, Fig. 3e), no significant difference in either was observed in the final sample while using active carbon (9.17% FURDIPE and 4.65% OLIG, Fig. 3c) or Pd/C catalyst the in absence of hydrogen (13.01% FURDIPE and 6.5% OLIG, Fig. 3d) in the final sample. Also, no oligomerization products were observed in preliminary runs with THF (Run 2 and 3), which supports the reversible nature of OLIG, derived from ethers (one of them being identified as difurfuryl ether by GC–MS). Active carbon support does not seem to have any activity towards hydrogenation, although it can offer additional adsorption sites. Different carbon supports are known to influence the adsorption properties of FUR activity and selectivity on Pd/C catalysts towards THFA [64,65]. As no hydrogenation activity was observed on carbon support, we believe that the chosen support influences adsorption properties but does not offer catalytic activity. A similar result was found, when using FA as the initial reactant with THF (Run 8, Fig. 3c) or IPRO (Run 9, Fig. 3f) as solvent. The reaction was set to 30 min at room temperature, following the prescribed heat-up ramp. Both reactions were rapid and achieved high conversion already at room temperature. >99.7% FA was converted at the 3rd sample (after ~ 65 min), which was taken after the heat-up ramp, when 100 °C was reached. High selectivity towards THFA (93.3% for THF and 91.4% for IPRO) with 100% conversion was achieved in both cases. Although the model predicts oligomerization from four species (FUR, FA, THFUR and THFA) almost no oligomers were found in these tests (beside those from impurities). Therefore we conclude that no oligomerization with FA or THFA occurred. Based on these findings we also believe that THFUR oligomerization does not occur. Only FUR was found to be susceptible for oligomerization and therefore, all other oligomerisation rates ( k 9 , k 10 , k 11 ) were zero. Other observed side product in both cases was MF (up to 2.6%) which was consumed to form MTHF (up to 6.0%). Therefore, we believe that the dominant pathway for MTHF formation is through MF, although THFA deoxygenation to MTHF is also plausible. The reaction rate constants and activation energies for these two reactions ( k 6 , k 7 ) could not be determined precisely, as no or minimal concentrations of MTHF were detected at various conditions. Also some FUR was present as impurity before the start of reaction and minor concentration of THFUR (up to 1.2%) were detected as a result. Due to observed slightly faster reactions and a slightly higher yield in case of using THF as the solvent, it seems to have a slight advantage over using IPRO as a solvent for FA conversion over Pd/C catalyst. Also fewer side products were observed as IPRO is more reactive and isopropyl ethers are formed. However, this is valid in case when hydrogen is in excess, as IPRO can also participate in reactions as proton donor solvent."
14,Solvent effects,"4.5 Solvent effects Catalytic tests were performed in absence of solvent (Runs 1 and 4), with the use of a polar aprotic solvent (THF) (Runs 2–3, 8 and 10–19) and with the use of a polar protic solvent (IPRO) (Runs 4, 6, 7, 9 and 20–29). These solvents were chosen due to their similar polarity [66] for comparison in order to have minimum influence on absorption properties of investigated species and to investigate the role of ether formation of furan-like molecules with isopropanol. By comparing the reactions with the use of THF or IPRO as a solvent, it was found, that the same reaction parameters can be used to describe kinetics in both solvents with similar results. The only parameter which differs is the Henry’s (He) constant, which influences hydrogen solubility in the liquid phase at given temperature and pressure. Slightly larger turnover frequencies (TOF) presented in Table 3 were generally obtained for IPRO, although etherification reactions are present, which makes the reaction mixture more complex. As isopropanol is a hydrogen donor solvent, it was chosen as the obvious source of additional hydrogen readily available on the catalyst surface through dehydrogenation of isopropanol ( k 20 ), which also, together with the solubility rate, explains the slightly higher TOF values. FURIPE was proposed to be a key intermediate in hydrogenation reactions by some other authors, in cases when IPRO was used [15]. It was also found by other authors, that the choice of solvent can influence the intrinsic activity and selectivity on different catalysts (Ni/SiO2, Ni/Al2O3, Cu/SiO2, Cu/Al2O3) [67], including Pd-based [50] ones in FUR hydrogenation reactions. Polarity plays a major role in selectivity, as polar solvents were found to increase the selectivity towards ring hydrogenation and THFA formation. Due to this comparison, we propose, that the reaction through ether formation with isopropanol might not play such an important role as previously believed and thus, we propose the formation of ethers, such FURDIPE, FURIPE, THFMDIPE and THFMIPE to be a result of reversible reactions with FUR, FA, THFUR or THFA (as seen in Fig. 1). The reversible nature of these reactions can be observed from the matching concentration profiles of those molecules in various IPRO runs."
15,Surface coverage,"4.6 Surface coverage The surface coverage by each compounds determined the reaction rate of its further conversion according to Eqs. (1) and (2) at every given time. Time profile of the surface coverages for three representative cases is shown in Figure S.3. In case when solventless FUR was used (Figure S.3a, d), furfural presents almost total surface coverage around 69% at time zero. In other cases, when a solvent was used with FA (Figure S.3b, e) or FUR (Figure S.3c, f), around 66% of the active sites were covered with the solvent and around 5% with furanic species. The solvent coverage therefore represents around 76% of all species coverage. The high surface coverage with the solvent is a result of its excess concentration in the reaction mixture. Due to similar molecular structure, all furanic species including the solvent (THF) have been set to have the same adsorption and desorption parameters. IPRO was also set to have the same adsorption properties due to model simplification. From this data, we believe that by using pure furfural with rapid hydrogen mass transport, much higher TOF’s could be reached, as more active sites would participate in the reaction. It is critical to evaluate the hydrogen mass transport limitations in such systems. It is evident from Figure S.3, that all hydrogen was consumed right after adsorption, as the surface is not saturated with hydrogen. Some hydrogen saturation on the catalyst surface is only observed when FA was used as initial reactant (Figure S.3e), which can explain the high selectivity of the reaction towards ring hydrogenation. If a system with limited hydrogen mass transport cannot be avoided in the industrial applications, we recommend using a solvent with the highest hydrogen solubility. However, if this is not an issue, pure furfural is preferred, as the surface kinetics does not seem to be affected much by solvents used in this study. We believe Pd(1 1 1) to be dominant and catalytically active for furfural hydrogenation, based on XRD results (Fig. 2a), which is in agreement with DFT and TPD studies found in literature [30,31,33]. However, lacking computational data is available for activity of other Pd planes and would need further investigation. Rogers et al. [21] showed that higher catalyst activity can be achieved by using smaller Pd nanoparticles on TiO2 support, which suggest other surfaces could be more active. However, smaller nanoparticles were also found to be more prone to deactivation by Pd carbide formation at temperatures below 50 °C. Nevertheless, DFT studies by Voratnikov et al. [30] and Wang et al. [33] showed, that flat adsorption of furfural with ring centered over Pd (1 1 1) fcc-hollow site is favorable at low furfural or hydrogen coverage. Furthermore, Voratnikov et al. [30] showed flat orientation to be favored for different unsaturated furanic species. This is consistent with our model assumptions and surface coverage calculations, which suggest furfural to cover below 5% of the active surface, while hydrogen is consumed at the moment it adsorbs. Also, relatively low activation barriers were determined by DFT calculations for furfural hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol. However, tilted orientation of adsorbed furfural was proposed to be more stable at higher coverage (0.75 ML) according to Wang et al. [33]. We believe this to be the case while using pure furfural (Figure S.3a, d) as 69% initial furfural coverage was estimated by our model."
16,Effect of temperature,"4.7 Effect of temperature The temperature variations tests were performed at five different temperature plateaus from 100 to 200 °C in both solvents (Fig. 4 a-e for THF and Fig. 4f-j for IPRO). Standard conditions were used (5 MPaH2, 600 rpm). The model describes the kinetics at varying temperatures well with only minor discrepancies. It is evident, that at lower temperatures (100 °C), FA, THFUR and THFA are the major products (or intermediates) while using THF (Fig. 4a) or IPRO (Fig. 4f). Rapid FUR hydrogenation occurred at room temperature in cases when IPRO was used as a solvent compare to the tests in THF. The model overestimates the THFUR concentration at 100 °C test with IPRO, although it describes the 100 °C test with THF well. As IPRO is a source of additional surface hydrogen, ring hydrogenation might be more favored. Also, higher yields of THFA were achieved with IPRO at all temperature tests in comparison to equivalent tests with THF at the same temperature of plateau. The difference is more noticeable at lower temperatures. Less THFUR was detected experimentally in most cases while using IPRO. However, its reversible product THFMDIPE was detected in higher concentrations. Also, all etherification products (FURDIPE, FURIPE, THFMDIPE and THFMIPE) were observed in all IPRO temperature tests. FA and THFA were the key intermediates in both solvents and their formation is favored at lower temperatures through partial hydrogenation of furfural. The dominant pathway seems to be through hydrogenation of FUR aldehyde group towards FA, followed by ring hydrogenation towards THFA, as already observed in preliminary runs (Run 8 and 9) and on basis of TOF’s. Also, the pathway through THFUR is competitive and cannot be neglected. FUR hydrogenation rates and further hydrogenation of FA ring were found to be minimally influenced by temperature (Ea1 = 23.5 kJ mol−1 and Ea4 = 24.0 kJ mol−1). Although FUR hydrogenation to THFUR has also a similar activation energy (Ea2 = 19.1 kJ mol−1), the subsequent aldehyde group hydrogenation of THFUR is more influenced by temperature (Ea3 = 42.5 kJ mol−1). Based on this, this pathway can be favored at higher temperatures. Although FA deoxygenation is much slower below 125 °C (Fig. 4b for THF and Fig. 4g for IPRO), it becomes competitive at higher temperatures (Ea5 = 59.6 kJ mol−1), with maximum TOF of 1.95 min−1 in comparison to FA hydrogenation, with maximum TOF of 4.07 min−1 and is faster compared to THFUR hydrogenation at 200 °C with maximum TOF 0.77 min−1. FUR aldehyde group hydrogenation is faster compared to FUR ring hydrogenation at all tested temperatures. More importantly, in order to prefer ring hydrogenation, hydrogen mass transport needs to be adequate. However, MF was already present at 100 °C runs (~0.5% yield in both solvents) with a more significant deoxygenation rate (above 4% MF yield) in both solvents at 150 °C (Fig. 4c for THF and Fig. 4h for IPRO), above 6% MF yield at 175 °C (Fig. 4d for THF and Fig. 4i for IPRO) and above 17% MF yield at 200 °C (Fig. 4e for THF and Fig. 4j for IPRO). The higher deoxygenation rate at high temperatures could be more inclined due to a lack of surface hydrogen species; deoxygenation was assumed to occur between dissolved hydrogen and adsorbed FA. It seems it is crucial for the catalyst to be saturated with hydrogen to achieve selective conversion towards THFA at high temperatures. Further ring hydrogenation of MF and THFA deoxygenation were even slower and the reaction rate constants and activation energies could not be determined precisely due to low MTHF concentrations even at 200 °C tests, where up to 0.6% MTHF was detected. Also THFA seems to be less subjected to decarbonylation, as its concentration seems to be stable. Oligomerisation of FUR was also found to have a relatively high activation barrier (Ea8 = 44.8 kJ mol−1) and could not be avoided by varying the process conditions. However, as hydrogenation is faster at room temperature, less OLIG were detected and after FUR was depleted, OLIG concentration remained almost stationary till the end of experiment."
17,Effect of pressure,"4.8 Effect of pressure Within pressure variation tests (Fig. 5 ) at 25, 50 and 75 bar, it was observed, that low pressure (2.5 MPa) (Fig. 5a for THF and Fig. 5d for IPRO) favors FA formation in both solvents as further hydrogenation is limited by hydrogen presence. More competitive reactions occur at intermediate pressures (5.0 MPa) (Fig. 5b for THF and Fig. 5e for IPRO) in both solvents. At higher pressure test (7.5 MPa), a rapid pressure drop was observed, right after adding hydrogen in the reaction vessel while using THF (Fig. 5c) or IPRO (Fig. 5f), turning the selectivity towards THFA. Although FA is still the dominant intermediate, FUR ring hydrogenation towards THFUR is increasingly dominant at higher pressures in THF as a result of higher surface hydrogen concentration. This highlights the importance of increased surface hydrogen presence for tuning selectivity towards ring hydrogenation. However, while using IPRO, concentration of THFUR decreases at higher pressures. This could be a result of partial hydrogenation prior to hydrogen gas addition due to hydrogen donor solvent followed by faster total hydrogenation. Also, it might be a result of changed etherification rates, as etherification parameters ( k 12 to k 19 ) were fitted at intermediate pressures (50 bar), where a good fit of ethers can be observed in contrast to 25 bar and 75 bar tests with a bad fit of ethers compared to experimental points. Although not included in the model, it was experimentally observed, that pressure does influence the etherification rates and it might also influence the equilibrium concentration of ethers, as a clear difference in ether concentration can be seen from varying pressure tests. However, these differences should not lead to significant discrepancies with other observed major products due to their reversible nature. Also, almost no MF formation was observed at low pressure tests, even when reaching 200 °C in case of using IPRO. This could be a result of faster hydrogen solubility and it’s consumption before reaching higher temperatures. Less deoxygenation was also observed in IPRO at higher pressures compared to THF, which might mean, that ring hydrogenation is enhanced due to higher presence of surface hydrogen, derived from IPRO."
18,Effect of stirring speed - hydrogen mass transport limitation,"4.9 Effect of stirring speed - hydrogen mass transport limitation Stirring speed tests (Fig. 6 ) were performed at 100, 600 and 1000 rpm at 200 °C, as reaction rates are the highest at the chosen (highest in this study) temperature, therefore the eventual mass transfer limitations are the most obvious. Results reveal that the reactions at 600 rpm and lower were limited by hydrogen availability on the catalyst surface. However, the model describes the data at all stirring speed tests well. Only one parameter ( k l a g ) was fitted to account for the difference in mass transfer rate. At low mixing speeds (100 rpm, Fig. 6a, d), the route through FA formation seems to be favorable, which can be denoted to lesser hydrogen coverage on the catalyst surface. Ring and aldehyde group hydrogenation reactions are competitive at intermediate mixing speed (600 rpm, Fig. 6b, e), while ring hydrogenation of FUR and also FA becomes dominant at higher mixing speeds (1000 rpm, Fig. 6c, f). Both ring hydrogenation products (THFUR and THFA) are favored by increasing the mixing speed and at the same time, less FA is formed in both solvents. This provides further proof that the correct mechanisms were chosen for hydrogenation reactions. There is one exception (Fig. 6d); more THFA was formed in IPRO at 100 rpm than at 600 rpm, which can again be explained by surface hydrogen specie formation from IPRO. At 1000 rpm in IPRO, minimal concentration of FA was observed. Due to faster mass transport, surface hydrogen concentration is enhanced and thus favoring almost explicitly ring hydrogenation products (THFUR, THFA), followed by aldehyde group hydrogenation. These results reveal the importance of mass transfer on selectivity of furfural catalytic hydrogenation reactions. Also, much less MF was formed as the dominant pathway was through THFUR formation, excluding the pathway through FA. In this way, it is possible to change the dominant pathway towards THFA production and higher selectivity can be achieved with fewer side products. Stirring speed has also no noticeable effect on the etherification rates, as the experimental data matches well with the model. Similar conclusions can be drawn for stirring speed tests with THF although no noticeable reaction occurred at room temperature and more deoxygenation products (MF, MTHF) were observed. This can be a result of a slightly lower hydrogen solubility and absence of in-situ hydrogen formation."
19,Catalyst reusability,"4.10 Catalyst reusability By conducting catalyst reusability tests in THF (Fig. 7 a) and IPRO (Fig. 7b), we can conclude that activity was mostly preserved during catalyst recycling without prior pre- or re-activation. 100% FUR conversion was achieved in all cases, while there was some drop in THFA yield after first reuse in both cases. Overall, similar yields of the measured compounds were achieved in all reusability tests, with small differences, which could be attributed to catalyst loss during recycling. It is interesting to note that less OLIG products were formed after each reuse and also, a small concentration of MTHF was observed only in the first run in both solvents. Some carbonaceous deposits might be formed on the catalyst. Rogers et al. [21] suggested smaller nanoparticles to be more prone to deactivation by Pd carbide formation at temperatures below 50 °C in IPRO by using Pd/TiO2 catalyst. We can exclude Pd leaching due to preserved activity after recycling. This is also consistent with Date et al. [49], who did not observed any measurable leaching of Pd at 220 °C in IPRO. Albilali et al. also observed negligible leaching of Pd at 30 °C by using 1.19% Pd/TiO2 catalyst in IPRO [25]."
20,Conclusion,"In this work, we have performed extensive experimental and computational study of furfural hydrogenation, hydrodeoxygenation, oligomerisation and etherification over a commercial Pd/C catalyst at varying temperature (100 to 200 °C) and pressure (25 to 75 bar) in tetrahydrofuran and isopropanol solvents and at different hydrogen mass transport rates. In-situ PdO reduction was observed during the reaction, forming predominantly Pd(111). Two surface reaction mechanisms (Langmuir — Hinshelwood and Eley — Rideal) used in the microkinetic model were found to describe the varying selectivity at different conditions well. The same kinetic parameters were used for both solvents (tetrahydrofuran or isopropanol) or in a solventless reaction by taking into account hydrogen thermodynamics and mass transport limitations for each solvent in case when the reaction is controlled by hydrogen mass transfer. Isopropanol showed some advantage due to its hydrogen donor properties and slightly higher hydrogen solubility compared to THF, which leads to less or no side products, such as ethers. Gas hydrogen was needed in both cases to achieve a measurable conversion. Decarbonylation products (such as furan or tetrahydrofuran) or ring opening products (such as n-Butanol or pentane diols) were not observed during these tests. By varying process conditions, the reaction pathway within the reaction network can be changed. Either hydrogenation of an aldehyde group is favored at lower hydrogen availability, while ring hydrogenation is dominant when the surface is saturated with hydrogen. Both pathways lead to tetrahydrofuran production if enough hydrogen is available. In order to avoid further deoxygenation, hydrogen in excess, rapid stirring and high hydrogen pressure should be used to avoid the pathway via furfuryl alcohol formation. On the other hand the selection of solvents with poor hydrogen solubility, slower mass transport, and low hydrogen pressure leads to deoxygenation, but only at high temperatures. The highest teterahydrofurfuryl alcohol yields can be achieved in the absence of mass transport limitations, as a result of chosen solvent and by using high pressure and rapid stirring. Such optimization would also lead to higher TOF’s, opposed to those obtained in this study. This research highlights some benefits and promising results for large-scale furfural upgrade, as the reaction selectivity and rates can be easily managed by varying the conditions directly related to surface activity and indirectly via availability of reactive species (especially hydrogen) on the surface through conditions affecting their transfer from the bulk liquid or gas phase."
