0,Introduction,"Nowadays, global energy requirements are mostly dependent on fossil fuels, which eventually pose a serious threat to our economy, environment, and energy security. At present, a great deal of attention is being paid to the utilization of hydrogen as alternative and eco-friendly fuel throughout the world [1]. It is believed that hydrogen will substitute fossil fuels as the next generation of clean energy sources. Traditionally, hydrogen is mainly produced by hydrocarbon reformation and electrolysis of water, which are energy-intensive, unfriendly to environment [2,3]. From environment and sustainable-energy points of view, microbial hydrogen production from renewable natural wastes can reduce dependence on fossil fuel, decrease carbon dioxide emissions, and recover bioenergy [4]. Cellulosic biomass waste is a kind of valuable and abundant renewable biomass resource on earth. Only in China, the annual yield of natural cellulosic waste exceeds 0.7 billion tons, among which, the amount of corn stalk is around 220 million tons [5]. So far most of them have not been effectively utilized in China [6–8]. At present, it has been proved that it can be served as feedstock for bio-hydrogen production [9–11]. To the best of our knowledge, the major difficult of the biodegradation for the cellulosic biomass is due to their complex chemical composition and surface structure, for instance, the maximum H2 yield of 2.68 mL H2/g-TS from raw wheat straw was only observed by dairy manure compost in our previous tests [6]. Therefore, the pretreatment of cellulosic biomass is generally considered to be a rate-limiting step in conversion of the feedstock into bio-hydrogen by dark fermentation because most hydrogen-producing bacteria digests soluble substrates to be much easier. So far various hydrolysis methods have been tried to promote the generation of bio-hydrogen from cellulosic waste. For example, Vrije et al. used the pretreated miscanthus as feedstock by 12% NaOH (w/w) at 70 °C for bio-hydrogen production [12]; Li et al. reported hydrogen production from steam-exploded corn straw by Clostridium butyricum AS1.209 [13]; Datar found the molar yield of 2.84 (51.7 mL H2/g) and 3.0 (71.7 mL H2/g) from hydrolyzate of corn stalk by neutral and acidic steam explosions, respectively [14]. However, the substrate pretreatment and the hydrogen production mechanism from cellulosic biomass by dark fermentation are not well done so far. Thus more efforts should be made for the above purpose. On the other hand, the classical experimental design with ‘one factor-at-a-time’ is usually utilized to investigate the effects of various variables on objective product [15]. However, this experimental design does not consider the interaction effects among variables and requires large number of experiments [4]. Compared with the above, the statistical experimental design using response surface methodology (RSM), a combination of stepwise mathematical and statistical techniques is time saving and needs fewer experiments, allows flexibility to assign the levels of variables, and gives closer confirmation of the output response toward the target requirements [4,16–20]. Based on above reasons, our research interest currently focuses on optimizing the process parameters of solid-state enzymatic hydrolysis from corn stalk for bio-hydrogen production by a standard RSM design. The degradation mechanism of corn stalk for hydrogen production was further discussed through X-ray diffraction (XRD) and morphological observation."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganism,"2.1 Microorganism Lesser panda manure, which was employed as the natural microbial consortium, was obtained from the Zhengzhou zoo. Prior to use, the mixtures of 3 kg manure (the moisture content of 67%) and 3 L water were continuously aerated by forced-air pumping for 24 h at ambient temperature, and then pre-incubated with glucose (5 g/L) in 5 L anaerobic reactor at 36 °C for 2–3 days."
3,Materials,"2.2 Materials Fresh-cut corn stalk was collected from an individual farm in the suburb of Zhengzhou City at harvest time. Its characteristics were as follows: total solid (TS) 25%, total volatile solid (TVS) 22%, soluble sugar 73 mg/g-TVS, cellulose 39.1%, hemicellulose 30.9% and lignin 8.65%. The materials were firstly ground by a vegetation disintegrator (FZ102) to pass 40 mesh screens. The solid-state compound enzyme (SCE), consisting mainly of cellulase 5000 IU/g, xylanase 350 IU/g, β- glucanase 500 IU/g, proteinase 300 IU/g, pectase 400 IU/g and glucosidase 350 IU/g, was provided by Beijing Zhongnongxiwang Biological Center, Beijing, China."
4,Experimental procedure,"2.3 Experimental procedure Among the thesis, the batch experiments were divided into two stages: Firstly, the corn stalk was hydrolyzed using the solid state compound enzyme (SCE), named solid state enzymolysis stage (I), in which the soluble sugar (SS) was the main hydrolysate. And then the hydrolyzed corn stalk from the above was further converted into bio-hydrogen by dark fermentation, called bio-hydrogen production stage (II), in which both bio-hydrogen gas as final objective product and VFAs/alcohols as main metabolic by-products were obtained, respectively. 2.3.1 Solid state enzymolysis of corn stalk The solid state enzyme hydrolysis of corn stalk was performed in serum bottle. The mixtures of the ground corn stalk, SCE and water with the corn stalk (dry basis)/water ratio of 1:3 (w/w) were sealed in serum bottles, in which the moisture content was about 75%, the initial pH of mixtures was not further adjusted before enzyme hydrolysis. And then the hydrolysis reaction was achieved under anaerobic condition. A central composite design, with three variables, was used to determine the optimum solid state enzyme hydrolysis conditions based on the maximum soluble sugar yield in stageI and H2 yield in stageII. The effect of the independent variables X 1 (temperature), X 2 (SCED) and X 3 (time), at five variation levels (Table 1 ) in the solid state enzyme hydrolysis process, is shown in Table 2 . Three replicates (Treatments 6, 13 and 15) at the centre of the design were used to allow for estimation of a pure error sum of squares. Experiments were randomized in order to maximize the effects of unexplained variability in the observed responses due to extraneous factors. A mixture of the grounded corn and water with the solid/liquid ratio of 1:2 (w/w) was heated in boiling water bath for 10 min. Solid bio-pretreatment: the mixtures of the ground corn stalk and the microbe additive were sealed in serum bottles, and reacted under anaerobic condition at 25 °C for 15 days. Meanwhile, the pH value of medium was not further adjusted. (solid loading of 5% (w/w)) were sealed in serum bottles, and operated at 50 °C ± 1 °C for 72 h with a rotation speed of 90 rpm. For statistical calculations, the natural variable Xi was coded as xi according as the Eq. (1). (1) x i = ( X i − X i ∗ ) / Δ X i where xi is a dimensionless coded value of the variable Xi , Xi ∗ is the value of Xi at the center point and ΔXi is the value of the step change. The average yield of the duplicate values obtained was taken as the dependent variable or response, Yi . The model proposed for the response is given below: (2) Y i = β 0 + ∑ β i x i + ∑ β i i x i 2 + ∑ β i j x i x j where Yi is the predicted response, β 0 is an offset term, βi is the liner effect, βii is the squared effect and βij is the interaction effect. The Minitab software (version 14.11, Minitab Ltd.) and “SAS V9 for Windows” (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) were used for the further regression and graphical analyses of the experimental data. The optimum values of the selected variables were obtained by solving the regression equation and also by analyzing the response surface contour plots [16,21,22]. Prior to use, the pretreated corn stalks were preserved at −20 °C for analysis and further hydrogen fermentation. 2.3.2 Conversion of hydrolyzed corn stalk into bio-hydrogen In this stage, the hydrolyzed corn stalk from the above was further converted into bio-hydrogen with 100 mL serum vials as bio-reactor, comprising the pre-incubated inoculums of 30 mL, nutrient stock solution of 2 mL and the hydrolyzed corn stalk from the above (15 g/L), and then adding water to working volume of 50 mL. The pH of mixtures was adjusted to 7.0 before hydrogen fermentation. These vials were filled with nitrogen gas and capped with rubber stopper. Then, the bottles were placed in an orbital shaker at 36 ± 1 °C and operated with a rotation speed of 90 rpm. The biogas volume at regular interval was measured by releasing the pressure in the bottles using displacement of saturated brine. All the experiments were carried out independently in triplicate."
5,Analytic methods,"2.4 Analytic methods The concentration of H2 was measured by Gas Chromatography (GC, Agilent 4890) (20). The soluble sugar and lactic acid were determined by the methods of P-hydroxydiphenyl colorimetry and anthrone-sulfuric colorimetry using HP 8453 UV–Visible system, respectively. The enzymatic hydrolysates (consisting mainly of arabinose, xylose, mannose, glucose and cellobiose) were treated with the reagent of Trimethylchlorosilane and Hexamethyl disiloxane, and then were analyzed by another GC (Agilent 4890) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and an HP-5 (Crosslinked 5% PH ME Siloxane) capillary column. The temperatures of the injection port, the detector, and the oven were 260 °C, 290 °C and a programmed column temperature of 160–280 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was the carrier gas at a flow rate of 40 mL/min. The pH values of samples were measured by a microcomputer pH-vision 6217. The contents of total solid (TS), total volatile solid (TVS) and the components of corn stalk were analyzed by Fan et al. and the Van Soest Method, respectively [6,23]. The crystallinity index (CrI) of the corn stalk was measured by XRD using an X-ray powder diffractometer (Bruker Axs: D8 focus) with Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 200 mA The CrI of the samples were calculated using the wide angle X-ray diffraction counts at 2θ angle close to 22 and 18° according to the Segal empirical method [24,25]. (3) CrI = I 22 − I 18 I 22 × 100 % where I 22 is the peak intensity of the crystalline material (2θ = 22°) and I 18 is the peak intensity of the amorphous material (2θ = 18°). Apparent crystallite size (ACS) was calculated using the Scherre equation [26,27]. (4) ACS = K λ P cos θ where λ is the wavelength of the radiation used, θ is the Bragg angle of the diffraction peak, P is the half width of the 002 peak in radians and K is a constant usually considered as 0.89. Hydrogen gas yield was calculated from the headspace measurement of gas composition and the total volume of biogas produced at each time interval using the mass balance equation [4,19]: (5) V = V 0 γ i + ∑ V i γ i where V is the cumulative H2 gas volumes at the current; V0 is the volume of headspace of vials; Vi is the biogas volume discharged from the vials at the time interval (i); γi is the fraction of H2 gas discharged from the vials at the time interval (i)."
6,Kinetic modeling,"2.5 Kinetic modeling The cumulative volume of H2 produced in the batch experiments followed the modified Gompertz equation: (6) H = P exp { − exp [ R m e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where H is the cumulative H2 production (mL), λ is the lag time (h), P is the H2 production potential (mL), Rm is the maximum H2 production rate (mL/h), and e is the 2.718281828. The values of P, Rm and λ for each batch tests were estimated using the solver function in Excel (version 5.0, Microsoft) with a Newtonian algorithm [2,6]; In this study, Ps (defined as mL H2/g-TS) and R m ’ (expressed as mL H2/g-TS h−1) were calculated by dividing P and Rm by the initial TVS content of the substrate, respectively [3,6]."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Statistical analysis,"3.1 Statistical analysis Using central composite design (CCD) and response surface analysis, the effects of three independent variables (temperature (X 1), SCED (X 2) and time (X 3)) on soluble sugar yield (stageI) and H2 yield (stageII) were investigated to determine the optimum condition of solid state enzymolysis and bio-hydrogen production from corn stalk, respectively. Generally speaking, the enzymatic hydrolysis of corn stalk was often accompanied by the generations of soluble sugar and lactic acid, hereby the total soluble sugar was selected as the response variable and further measured in the batch tests. Table 2 presents the design matrix of the variables along with the experimental results. As can be seen from Table 2, the three independent variables (X 1, X 2 and X 3) significantly affected soluble sugar yield (Y 1), lactic yield and H2 yield (Y 2). For instance, in contrast with the controls, the yields of soluble sugar and lactic significantly increased from 73 mg/g-TVS and 0 mg/g-TVS to 516.8 mg/g-TVS and 25.4 mg/g-TVS with enzymatic hydrolysis conditions of 45 °C, 0.05 g SCED/g-corn stalk and 9 days (stageI). Similarly, the corresponding H2 yield increased from155.9 mL/g-TVS to 205.3 mL/g-TVS compared with that of the controls. It should be noted that the medium pH value decreased gradually along with the increase of enzymolysis time from 7.0(controls) to 4.5 (at 45 °C, 0.05 g SCED/g-corn stalk and 9 days) and 3.97 (at 45 °C, 0.05 g SCED/g-corn stalk and 15 days) during the solid state enzymatic hydrolysis processes. The drop of medium pH could be attributable to formation of lactic acid and acidification of reactor arisen from excessive hydrolysis of substrate [4]. By applying multiple regression analysis on the experimental data, the following second order polynomial equations (Eqs.(7) and (8)) were constructed to interpret the saccharification and the bio-hydrogen generation from corn stalk, respectively: (7) Y 1 = 505.11 + 42.76 x 1 + 26.28 x 2 + 44.78 x 3 − 52.77 x 1 2 − 59.77 x 2 2 − 72.08 x 3 2 + 11.88 x 1 x + 22.5 x 1 x 3 + 20.7 x 2 x 3 (8) Y 2 = 204.22 + 5.71 x 1 − 1.33 x 2 − 6.94 x 3 − 8.89 x 1 2 − 6.79 x 2 2 − 6.44 x 3 2 + 1.5 x 1 x 2 + 1.76 x 1 x 3 − 0.056 x 2 x 3 where Y 1 and Y 2 are the predicted soluble sugar yield and H2 yield, respectively; x 1, x 2 and x 3 are the coded values of temperature, SCED and time, respectively. The statistical significances of Eqs. (7) and (8) were checked by an F-test, and the analyses of variance (ANOVA) for response surface quadratic models are presented in Table 3 , respectively. The model F-values of 39.36 and 24.81 implied that the models were highly significant (P ≤ 0.001), respectively. There was only a 0.02% chance that it could occur due to noise. Here the determination coefficient (R 2) values of 0.9806 and 0.9696 indicated the good agreements between experimental and predicted values. Furthermore, the complete analysis of variance for the responses Y 1 and Y 2 was summarized in Table 4 . The P-values are used as a tool to check the significance of each coefficient. The smaller the value of P, the more significant is the corresponding coefficient. It can be seen from Table 4 that all the linear, square and interaction terms of x 1, x 2 and x 3 had a significant effect on soluble sugar yield with low P-values of less than 0.1 except the interactive term of x 1 x 2. Unlike soluble sugar yield, both the linear and square terms of x 1, x 2 and x 3 had a significant effect on H2 yield with low P-values of less than 0.001 except the linear term of x 2."
9,Effect of solid state enzymolysis on soluble sugar yield,"3.2 Effect of solid state enzymolysis on soluble sugar yield Both 3D response surface curves and its corresponding 2D contour line were constructed in Fig. 1 using the Minitab software. Here each response surface plot represents the effect of two independent variables at the zero level of the third variable. The shape of the corresponding contour plot indicates whether the mutual interactions between the independent variables are significant or not. As shown in Fig. 1, the response surface of soluble sugar yield showed a clear peak, indicating that the optimum enzymatic hydrolysis conditions using SE felled inside the design boundary well. As can be seen from Fig. 1A, the enzymolysis efficiency of corn stalk was significantly affected by temperature and SCED. The soluble sugar yield increased with the increase in temperature and SCED within the range of 35.0–47.7 °C and 0.03–0.054 g/g, respectively. The maximum soluble sugar yield of 503 mg/g-TVS appeared at the temperature of 47.7 °C and SCED of 0.054 g/g. Beyond this level the trend was reversed because of the inactivation of enzyme at the inappropriate temperature [28,29]. On the other hand, the excessive SCED would result in the acidification of the substrate and fall of pH value in the reactor. In this case, the enzymatic activity would be inhibited. Similarly, in the light of Fig. 1B and C, it was noted that the effects of SCED (X 2) and time (X 3) on the soluble sugar yield (Y 1) were sensitive when SCED and time was subject to small alteration below 0.054 g/g and 10.3 days, respectively. For instance, the maximum soluble sugar yield of 523 mg/g-TVS (Fig. 1B) and 516 mg/g-TVS (Fig. 1C) occurred at the temperature of 47.7 °C, 10.3 days and SCED of 0.054 g/g, 10.3 days, respectively. Beyond this level the soluble sugar yield rapidly decreased. The elliptical nature of the contour plots of Fig. 1B and C indicate that the mutual interactions between two independent variables (X 1 and X 3, X 2 and X 3) are significant. According to the differentiation of Eq. (7), the maximum possible yield of soluble sugar was 531.2 mg/g-TVS (Y 1) under the following solid-state enzymolysis conditions: 47.7 °C (x 1 = 0.5395), SCED of 0.054 g/g-corn stalk (x 2 = 0.3505) and 10.3 days (x 3 = 0.4452). In order to confirm the predicted results of the model, the verification experiments (N = 5) under optimal condition were carried out. The average soluble sugar yield of 526.1 ± 6.4 mg/g-TVS was in close to an agreement with the predicted value of 531.2 mg/g-TVS. The result afforded an evidence for the model validation under the investigated conditions. In addition, the component of the soluble sugar was further analyzed by GC, which was mainly composed of arabinose (4.1%), xylose (10.2%), mannose (1.6%), glucose (74.5%), and cellobiose (7.0%)."
10,Effect of solid state enzymolysis on hydrogen yield,"3.3 Effect of solid state enzymolysis on hydrogen yield Under the optimal enzymatic hydrolysis condition of section 3.2, the corn stalk was hydrolyzed, and then the hydrolyzed product was further converted into bio-hydrogen by conventional dark fermentation. In this case, the maximum H2 yield was not obtained. For these reasons, the solid state enzymolysis condition of corn stalk was further optimized for obtaining maximum H2 yield from the hydrolyzed substrate during dark fermentation process. The effects of three independent variables (X 1, X 2 and X 3) on hydrogen yield (Y 2) were further explored as shown in Fig. 2 . As shown in Fig. 2A, the H2 yield (Y 2) increased gradually with the increase in X 1 and X 2 in the range of 35∼46.3 °C and 0.03∼0.049 g/g, while the third variable was kept at zero level (X 3 = 9 days). Beyond this level, the H2 yield gradually decreased. Similarly, in the light of Fig. 2B and C, it was noted that hydrogen yield (Y 2) was remarkably influenced by X 1 X 3 and X 2 X 3, respectively. The maximum H2 yield of 206.7 mL/g-TVS for Fig. 2B and 206.1 mL/g-TVS for Fig. 2C occurred at 46.3 °C, 7.5 days and 0.049 g/g of SCED and 7.5 days, respectively. Beyond this level, the trends were reversed with further increase in the two independent variables, respectively. The isoresponse contours of H2 yield showed the approximate rounded ridge running diagonally on plots, implying that the variables were slightly interdependent, respectively. From equations derived by differentiation of Eq.(8), the optimal values of x 1, x 2 and x 3 were found to be 0.2658 (X 1 = 46.3 °C), −0.0665 (X 2 = 0.049 g/g-corn stalk) and −0.5022 (X 3 = 7.5 days), in which, the maximum predicted value of H2 yield was 206.8 mg/g-TVS. The repeated experiments (205.5 ± 5.7 mL/g-TVS (N = 5)) showed good agreement with the model predication value of 206.8 mL/g-TVS, in which the H2 production rate of 21 mL/g-TVS h−1 was further observed. The overlay plots of Fig. 3 were generated by superimposing the contours for the corresponding response surfaces of Y 1 and Y 2. As can be seen from Fig. 3 that the shaded portion of the overlay plots represented the permissible values of the variables by defining the desired limits of the Y 1 (>510 mg/g-TVS) and Y 2 (>206 mL/g-TVS). It is noteworthy that the optimized conditions of solid-state enzymolysis for soluble sugar yield (Y 1) (47.7 °C, 0.054 g/g, 10.3 days) were not in accordance with that for hydrogen yield (Y 2) (46.3 °C, 0.049 g/g, 7.5 days). From the above it can be seen that a high correlation was lacking between the soluble sugar (Y 1) and H2 yield (Y 2). From the above it can be seen that the solid state enzymolysis was a more effective pretreated method for hydrogen production from corn stalk in contrast with that from references. For instance, Datar and co-workers utilized the hydrolyzate of corn stalk by neutral and acidic steam explosions as feedstock, and obtained a low level of total sugar yield (e.g., 156.8 mg/g from neutral pretreated corn stover, and 204.5 mg/g from acidic pretreated corn stover) [14]. Based on these results, we speculated that the high H2 yield was closely related with the direct biodegradation of the hemicellulose and cellulose parts except for the contribution of the generated soluble sugar and lactic acid from the SCE pretreated corn stalk during the hydrogen fermentation [30]. Meanwhile, the solid state enzymolysis of substrate played a vital role in the effective conversion of corn stalk into bio-hydrogen by mixed culture [4,6–8]."
11,Biodegradation mechanism of corn stalk,"3.4 Biodegradation mechanism of corn stalk 3.4.1 X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) The crystallinity of cellulosic biomass has been frequently brought up as a factor influencing the hydrolysis and biological utilization of the biomass. The CrI was strongly influenced by the biomass composition. For lignocellulosic biomass, the CrI measures the relative amount of crystalline cellulose in the total solid. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the samples, such as raw corn stalk (RCS), the hydrolyzed corn stalk using solid-state enzyme SCE (SECS) and the corn stalk residue after producing hydrogen (CSR), was shown in Fig. 4 , from which the CrI and ACS was summarize in Table 5 . As shown in Table 5, the CrI and ACS of SECS sample rapidly dropped after solid-state enzyme hydrolysis, both SECS and CSR had a lower cellulose crystallinity compared with the RCS. The values of CrI and ACS dropped from 38.7% to 9.99 nm of RCS to 21.9% and 9.11 nm of SECS, respectively. This was primarily caused by the removal of cellulose from RCS in the enzymolysis process. On the contrary, the values of CrI and ACS were actually increased from 21.9% to 9.11 nm of SECS to 30.9% and 10.7 nm of CSR, respectively. The results from the above seemed to suggested that a part of hemicellulose in SECS was degraded directly during the hydrogen fermentation, which was in accord with most previous researches [4,30,31]. 3.4.2 Morphologic changes of corn stalk SEM micromorphology study has been widely used to investigate the morphology features and surface characteristics of cellulosic biomass. The morphological change information of RCS, SECS and CSR based on the SEM image was illustrated in Fig. 5 . As shown in Fig. 5A, the RCS displayed a tight and highly ordered surface structure. Whereas, after the solid state enzymolysis, the SEM image of SECS (Fig. 5B) exhibited irregular microporous structure compared with the RCS, which indicated that partial biodegradation of corn stalk by SCE. In the SEM image of CSR (Fig. 5C), SECS sample was degraded into the honeycomb microporous structure by hydrogen fermentation, which revealed an apparent morphological damage of cornstalk residues caused by hydrogen production microorganism."
12,Conclusion,"The response surface methodology (RSM) based on a three factor-five level central composite design (CCD) was demonstrated to be an effective method in order to optimize the key process parameters of solid-state enzymolysis from corn stalk. It is noteworthy that the optimized solid-state enzymolysis condition for SS yield (Y 1) (47.7 °C, 0.054 g/g, 10.3 days) were not in accordance with that for hydrogen yield (Y 2) (46.3 °C, 0.049 g/g, 7.5 days). From the above it can be seen that a high correlation was lacking between the two enzymatic hydrolysis conditions for soluble sugar (Y 1) and H2 yield (Y 2). The results suggested that the high bio-hydrogen potential from corn stalk was mainly attributed to the generated soluble sugar (SS) by solid-state enzymolysis, and was also related to the direct biodegradation of the corn stalk during the hydrogen fermentation process. Meanwhile, the solid state enzymolysis of substrate played a crucial role in efficient conversion of corn stalk into bio-hydrogen."
