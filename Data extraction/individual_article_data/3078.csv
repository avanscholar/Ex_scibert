0,Introduction,"Minimally invasive surgery techniques offer many benefits for the patients over traditional surgeries, such as less associated injuries, quicker recovery time, and less pain [1]. However, these techniques require a new generation of injectable biomaterials, which can be implanted through a small incision using special devices. When targeting bone-scaffolds applications, the influent should have excellent injectability as well as the ability to harden within an appropriate period of time, giving stability to the implantation site. β Tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) is a promising biomaterial which has superior biocompatibility, biodegradability, and osteoconductivity [2]. In clinical application, the synthetic TCP can form a viscous and easy modulable paste that sets and hardens within the body as a non-stoichiometric calcium deficient hydroxyapatite or brushite [3]. As it is known, for a successful clinical application of bone materials in minimally invasive surgery, the foremost considerations must be the injectability. Recent developments have put forward the possibility of using TCP in combination with different low-temperature processing techniques, like extrusion 3D printing, to obtain pre-set scaffolds [4]. In the cases of 3D printing, TCP paste is injected through a thin diameter nozzle to print the lattice structures layer by layer. However, during the process of printing, the separation of between the powder (consisting of one or more compounds of calcium and phosphate salts) and liquid phase (water or an aqueous solution) is difficult to avoid [5]. Phase separation extrudates have a significantly higher liquid content than the paste charged [6], leading to the increment of the injection force in the syringe. Prevention from phase separation during 3D-printing is critical to the process of 3D printing and minimally invasive surgery. Plenty of studies attempting to optimize TCP for clinical applications focused on improving the fluidity and processibility of TCP to the surgical site through injection. Different approaches were already developed to alter cement rheology to improve injectability [7]. The accessible way is increasing the liquid to powder (L/P) ratio of printing substrate. Although it has a positive effect [8], the mechanical properties are negatively affected due to an increase of cement porosity [9]. Another approach to optimize injectability is to adjust the particle size of the cement powder. In general, a smaller particle size was shown to improve injectability, but prolonged milling leads to a reduction of injectability on account of the particle agglomeration, accompanied by decrease in compressive strength [10]. Besides, since the setting reaction occurring in cement negatively affects the injectability, the application of setting retarders can also be beneficial [11]. The most conventional retarders are multiply-charged ions, which alters the zeta potential of cement particles and changes the properties of the fluid, because the resulting repulsion between particles of the same charge leads to a decrease in viscosity, resulting in the poor formability of the printing scaffolds [10]. Therefore, the development of alternatives is in urgent need. Thanks to its water solubility, non-toxicity, non-carcinogenicity and good biocompatibility, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) has been widely studied for biomedical applications. Accepted by the FDA (USA) and regulatory organizations in many other countries, PVA is widely used in a variety of material modifications owing to the presence of various link sites which can cross-link with other polymers to produce hybrid scaffolds with stable structure and improve the mechanical and physical properties [12]. Gelatin is also a water-soluble protein derived from natural polymer collagen. Gelatin-based hydrogels, such as gelatin/fibrinogen, gelatin/hyaluronan, and gelatin/alginate/fibrinogen, have unique features in organ 3D bioprinting technologies [13]. In many cases, cells are sensitive to surface topography, including roughness [14,15], micropore [16], microgroove [17,18], and curvature [19], A wide variety of cell properties can be affected by the above factors. For example, when MSCs (mesenchymal stem cells) were cultured in decellularized cancellous bone scaffolds coated with collagen hydroxyapatite mixture, osteogenic differentiation of MSCs was enhanced as the stiffness of the scaffolds increased from 6.7 kPa to 23.6 kPa [20]. In addition, it has also been reported that MG63 cells were more easily adhered to and spread on the polycarbonate membrane with 0.2–1 μm in diameter of micropore sizes than the membrane with a larger size of micropores [21]. Based on the findings, a lot of effort has been made to solve the problem of the injectability of printing biological ceramics. However, these methods still have some drawbacks, such as the reduction in mechanical properties, particle agglomeration, and biotoxicity. Therefore, in order to improve the injectability of printing biological ceramics, we hypothesized that introduction of PVA into TCP pastes manifested a better printability and molding properties. In this work, we fabricated the 3D printing Gel-PVA-TCP scaffolds in a novel printing system. The TCP pastes with better printability can maintain the preset diameter and pore size. After sintering of the scaffolds, with the evaporation and decomposition of Gel and PVA, the microstructure of the surface on the scaffolds also promoted the adhesion of cells [22,23]. As a result, the characteristics, biocompatibility, and cell responses of the Gel-PVA-TCP scaffolds were also investigated to verify the potential influence of this microstructure on cell behavior."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (CaHPO4·2H2O), calcium carbonate (CaCO3), gelatin, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and absolute ethanol were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., Shanghai, China. Reagents for cell experiments will be described later. All the commercial chemicals are analytically pure."
3,Preparation of TCP powder,"2.2 Preparation of TCP powder The TCP power was synthesized as previously [24]. Briefly, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (CaHPO4·2H2O) were mixed at Ca/P = 1.5, and absolute ethanol was added as a wet milling medium to obtain a reaction slurry. After being ball-milled at 300 rpm for 2 h (ball materials: zirconia; diameter, 0.4 mm; ball-power ratio, 1:2), the mixed slurry was placed in a blast drying oven to be sufficiently dried. The muffle furnace (KSL-1400X-A2, Kejing Material Technology Co., Ltd, China) was used to heat the mixed dry power to 1000 °C to obtain β-TCP (heating rate:4 °C/min, isothermal time: 2 h, cooling rate:8 °C/min). The chemical reaction equation is shown in Eq. (1): (1) 2CaHPO4·2H2O + CaCO3 Ca3(PO4)2+5H2O + CO2↑"
4,Preparation of PVA and gelatin solution,"2.3 Preparation of PVA and gelatin solution PVA was added to deionized water at 95 °C stirred for 3 h (300 rpm) to obtain PVA solutions (5 wt%, 10 wt%, 15 wt%). Gelatin was added to deionized water at 60 °C for 2 h to obtain the 20 wt% gelatin solution. All the pre-made solutions were then cooled to room temperature."
5,Particle size distribution,"2.4 Particle size distribution The particle size distribution of the β-TCP power was determined by Zeta potential and particle size analyzer (Brookhaven Instruments Corp, Holtsville, USA). Deionized water was used as a dispersing agent. A data evaluation was performed using the particle solutions software (version 3.5.0.6158). Three independent preparations of each sample were measured, and 3 measurement runs of each preparation were performed."
6,Thermogravimetric analysis,"2.5 Thermogravimetric analysis Measurements were taken with a Thermogravimetric Analysis (STA2500 Regulus, Germany). Approximately 10 mg of samples was used for each measurement. Samples were tested within a 20 °C to 1000 °C temperature ramp with an increasing rate of 50 °C/min under nitrogen atmosphere (20 mL min−1) to avoid oxidation."
7,Fabrication of scaffolds through 3D printing,"2.6 Fabrication of scaffolds through 3D printing To prepare the printing paste, 4 g of TCP power, 1.8 mL 20 wt% gelatin solution, and 0.2 mL PVA solution (5%, 10%, 15%) were added to a 10 mL beaker. We defined the three group as PVA 5, PVA10, and PVA 15 according to the adding concentration of PVA, respectively. Notably, 0.2 mL 20 wt% gelatin solution was also added in the control group without PVA solution and the control group was defined as PVA 0. The power-gel mixture was thoroughly stirred. The paste was spurted out layer by layer at the thickness of 330 μm and distance of 0.4 mm by 3D printing machine (Livprint Norm, Medprin, Guangzhou, China) with a diameter 400 μm spinneret to form a cubic porous scaffold in a volume of 10*10*5 mm under low temperature of −5 °C. The forward extrusion rate is 5% and speed for print moves was 15 mm/s. After all the printed scaffolds were removed to a freeze dryer (LyoQuest-85 PLUS, Telstar, Spain) with a thin blade for 48 h. They were sintered at 1000 °C for 2 h in a muffle furnace (DHG-9620 A, Shanghai Yiheng Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd, China) to remove the organic binder (heating rate:4 °C/min, isothermal time: 2 h, cooling rate:8 °C/min)."
8,The printability of Gel-PVA-TCP pastes,"2.7 The printability of Gel-PVA-TCP pastes To precisely print 3D scaffolds with various PVA concentrations, the printing parameters were optimized by assessing the printability of TCP-PVA at different temperatures. Here, the printability was directly verified by the shapes of pastes fibers at the nozzle outlet and the printable pastes were able to form regular and smooth fibers during the squirt. However, longitudinal instability of irregular pastes occurred at the nozzle outlet leading to spindle shaped filaments. Likewise, the pastes with high viscosity formed wrinkled filaments at the nozzle outlet and was considered as unextrudable paste."
9,Characteristic of the scaffolds,"2.8 Characteristic of the scaffolds Macropores of Gel-PVA-TCP scaffolds were measured with optical microscope (Eclipse Ti2–U, Nikon, Japan). For each group (PVA0 PVA5 PVA10 PVA15), random 20 macropoes of 5 samples were measured to obtain the average macropore of scaffolds. Micro pores were measured with the software Nano Measurer 1.2. scanning electron microscope (SEM) photographs of each group were taken for measurement. Based on the Archimedes’ principle, the apparent porosity of the scaffolds was determined by hydrostatic weighing. The porosity of samples was calculated based on the following formula: 100 Porosity (%) =(V1–V2)/V1* Where V1 and V2 represented the volume calculated from the measured height and diameter of the sample and the volume of the sample soaked in alcohol, respectively. Five samples of each group were tested."
10,Rheometry assay,"2.9 Rheometry assay Rheometry assays were performed on HAAKE RheoStress 1 rheometer (376-0001 Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Briefly, 2 g of TCP power, 1.8 mL 20 wt% gelatin solution, and 0.2 ml PVA solution (5%, 10%, 15%) were added to a 10 mL beaker. For the control group, only 0.2 mL 20 wt% gelatin solution was added without PVA solution. The power-gel mixture was thoroughly stirred with a magnetic stirring. Then 400 μL of the power-gel mixture was loaded for analysis on the plate of the rheometer. Dynamic frequency sweep tests were performed in a range of frequencies from 0.17 to 17 rad/s at a constant of 1%."
11,Compression testing,"2.10 Compression testing The mechanical properties of the scaffolds were measured using a standard (GB/T 8813–2008) compression modulus test with a load cell capacity of 2000 N under a test speed of 1 mm/min (KT23.104 Guangzhou Kiatest equipment CO., LCD). For each group of scaffolds, five samples were tested. All the ceramic specimens prepared for compression testing were 10*10*5 mm3."
12,Extrusion force,"2.11 Extrusion force The injectability of the different pastes, consisting of β-TCP, gelatin, and PVA, was measured using a custom syringe mount and the universal testing machine (KT23.104 GuangZhou Kiatest equipment CO., LCD). A 3 mL syringe equipped with a 420 μm (22 gauge) diameter needle was used. The syringe filled with the cement paste was mounted in the testing machine, and the pressure was applied at a cross-head speed of 1 mm/min. The measurement was finished until the entire paste was pressed out of the syringe or the maximum force of 250 N was reached."
13,Cell culture,"2.12 Cell culture Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs; No. HUXMA-01001, Cyagen, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were used to study the biotoxicity and biocompatibility of Gel-PVA-TCP scaffolds. The hBMSCs was cultured in cell culture flasks in an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) with a humidified atmosphere. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was used for cell culture and was refreshed every two days. All the cells in this experiment were not over 8 passages. Cell assay was performed on all the prepared scaffolds (see in Fig. 8) with different PVA concentrations. Three scaffolds of each group were tested. All the scaffolds were tested for cell seeding and we used at least 3 scaffolds in each cell assay."
14,Cell proliferation assay,"2.13 Cell proliferation assay Alamar Blue Kit (YEASEN, shanghai, China) was used to evaluate cell proliferation according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the initial cell number seeded on scaffolds was 2 × 105. The measurement was performed on 1 day, 5 day, 8 day after the cells were seeded on the scaffolds. The optical density value of the supernatant was read on a microplate reader (Epoch 2, BIOTEK, USA) at wavelengths of 570 and 600 nm."
15,Scanning electron microscope,"2.14 Scanning electron microscope The morphology of scaffolds was observed by a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, AMRAY, 1000B, USA), equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS; XF lash 6130, Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). Before SEM observation, all samples were washed with PBS (phosphate buffered solution) three times at the time point and cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Human mesenchymal stem cells were then dehydrated using graded ethanol. Specifically, scaffolds were imperiled in gradient dehydration using 30%, 50%, 75%, 85%, 95%, 100% alcohol. The cell morphology was observed through SEM after extensive drying and sputtered gold at room temperature, with an accelerating voltage of 10.0 kV."
16,Phase separation and liquid migration,"2.15 Phase separation and liquid migration To enable visualization of the flow patterns for the solids, an orange dye (Lianyungang Xinai Food Technology Co., LTD) was used to stain the gelatin, without changing the concentration of gelatin solution. The extrudate exiting the syringe was collected as two consecutive samples of approximately equal volume labeled (The first exiting extrudate was labeled E1. The second exiting paste was labeled E2) (Fig. 4). Each sample was initially weighed and dried in an oven at 100 °C until a constant weight was reached. Pre-drying and post-drying weights were used to determine LPR (liquid power ratio) using a protocol similar to the reported by Rory O'Neill et al. [5]. The paste remaining in the barrel was carefully removed and sliced along a diametrical plane direction. This revealed the flow pattern at the nozzle in the longitudinal direction."
17,Statistical analysis,"2.16 Statistical analysis All figures involving statistics were generated by origin 2020 (Origin Lab America). All experiments were conducted at least three times and graphs represent Means ± SD. Statistical analyses were carried out by one-way ANOVA or two-sample t-test. P-value < 0.001,***, P-value< 0.01,**, P-value < 0.05,*, NS: not significant (see Fig. 5)."
18,Results,
19,Characterization of TCP、PVA、gelatin and Gel-PVA-TCP pastes,"3.1 Characterization of TCP、PVA、gelatin and Gel-PVA-TCP pastes To know the characterization of TCP, PVA, gelatin, and TCP hybrid pastes, a series of assays were performed (Fig. 1 ). Particle diameter distributions of the sintering TCP power were shown in Fig. 2A the average particle diameter, D50 was about 25 μm. The thermogravimetric curves of PVA and gelatin were shown in Fig. 2B it could be seen when the temperature rises to 250 °C, the weight loss of gelatin was about 15 wt%. The weight loss of gelatin at 400–600 °C was 60 wt%. when the temperature rose to 750 °C, the weight loss was about 90 wt%. However, when the temperature rose to 500 °C, the weight loss of PVA was 100 wt%. The flow curve of the Gel-PVA-TCP pastes was presented in Fig. 2C. All of them exhibited similar shear-thinning characters. Although very close to each other, if ordered by decreasing viscosity at given shear rates, the curves appeared as PVA 0% > PVA 15%>PVA 10%>PVA 5%. The forces required for extruding the PVA-TCP pastes were shown in Fig. 2D. It could be seen that with the increment of PVA concentration, the forces increase accordingly."
20,The printability of Gel-PVA-TCP pastes,"3.2 The printability of Gel-PVA-TCP pastes To precisely print 3D scaffolds with various PVA concentrations, the printing parameters were optimized by assessing the printability of TCP-PVA at different temperatures. Here, the printability was directly verified by the shapes of pastes fibers at the nozzle outlet because only pastes forming regular and smooth fibers (Fig. 3 ) were considered as printable pastes. As shown in Fig. 3, in the cases of lower PVA concentrations (5%, 10% 15%), the bioinks could be printed at a lower temperature, while in the cases of the pastes without PVA (0%), the pastes were too viscous to form the smooth fibers at the nozzle outlet, which were considered as unextrudable pastes. While by adjusting suitable temperature, TCP pastes could be smooth and uniform steadily even with pastes without PVA (0%). Therefore, doping PVA was confirmed to improve the printability of TCP pastes by lower the printing temperature."
21,Flow regime of liquid and powder components during extrusion,"3.3 Flow regime of liquid and powder components during extrusion As shown in Fig. 4A, the paste doping with PVA5, PVA10, PVA15 can be extruded from the barrel thoroughly, while the PVA 0 group remained half of the pastes in the barrel. The paste remaining in the barrel in the barrel was carefully removed and sliced along a diametrical plane direction (Fig. 4C). The dye flew to the lower part of the paste, indicating that the liquid power ratio was higher in the lower part of the paste. As shown in Fig. 4E, the extrudate 1 (E1) was significantly higher than other groups (PVA5 PVA10 PVA15) as well as E2 in the PVA 0 group, indicating that phase separation happened during the extraction, while PVA accelerate the phase separation."
22,Macropores of Gel-PVA-TCP scaffolds,"3.4 Macropores of Gel-PVA-TCP scaffolds To further clarify whether PVA would influence the printing precision, the microstructure of Gel-PVA-TCP scaffolds was taken to study. Fig. 5 presented the printing structures (10*10*3 mm3) and fiber spacing using different concentrations of TCP-PVA pastes, respectively. All pastes were printed into fully interconnected grid structures without internal pore collapse (Fig. 5A B). As shown in Fig. 5C, the compressive strength of sintered scaffolds and free-sintered scaffolds were similar to each other, which indicated that sintering did not change the compressive strength of the scaffolds. As shown in Fig. 5D, the average pores sizes of different PVA concentrations were close to each other, which means that doping PVA into TCP pastes didn't change the printing precision of the Gel-PVA-TCP scaffolds."
23,Micropores of Gel-PVA-TCP scaffolds,"3.5 Micropores of Gel-PVA-TCP scaffolds To characterize the morphology of the 3D printing Gel-PVA-TCP scaffolds, relevant assays were performed (Fig. 6 A). As shown in Fig. 6, the Gel-PVA-TCP scaffolds without sintering showed a similar micropore size (Fig. 6A) and total porosity(Fig. 6B). With the increment of the doping concentration of PVA, the bonding between particles decreased (Fig. 6A). However, doping different concentration of PVA didn't influent the total porosity of the Gel-PVA-TCP scaffolds (Fig. 6B). as shown in Fig. 7 , after sintering, the Gel-PVA-TCP scaffolds showed very different morphology characterization. As shown in Fig. 2B, the mass of PVA would decrease to 0 wt% when the temperature rises to 500 °C, while the mass of gelatin still has at least 10% when the temperature rises to 1000 °C. Therefore, after sintering, the micropores were left after the PVA decomposed (Fig. 7). As shown in Fig. 7B, the concentration of PVA significantly influenced the size of the micropore. In Table 1 , the micropore size of scaffolds without doping PVA is about 4.44 ± 0.7 μm. The TCP doping 5%/10%/15% concentration of PVA were 1.54 ± 0.3, 2.59 ± 0.6, 3.59 ± 1.0, respectively."
24,Cell viability and cell morphology on Gel-PVA-TCP scaffolds,"3.6 Cell viability and cell morphology on Gel-PVA-TCP scaffolds To better understand the cell proliferation on our scaffolds, Alamar Blue assays were performed using hBMSCs cells (Fig. 8B). As described in Fig. 8B, all the scaffolds exhibited the semblable cell viability, confirming they were all kind to cells and retained a good biocompatibility. Based on the SEM images (Fig. 8A), the cells adhered to the surface of the scaffolds. Comparing the 0 wt% Gel-PVA-TCP, and 15% Gel-PVA-TCP, more cells adhered to the surface of 5% and 10% TCP-PVA, which was in accord with the cell area on the surface of the scaffolds (Fig. 8C). Besides, in the cases of 5% and 10% groups, cells deeply adhered to the internal micropores of the scaffolds, while in the cases of 0% and 15%groups, cells only adhered to the surface of the scaffolds."
25,Discussion,"In recent years, a great deal of efforts have been made to solve the problem of the injectability of printing biological ceramics. However, these existing methods bring about some drawbacks, like decreasing the mechanical properties, particle agglomeration, and biotoxicity. To solve the problems above, we put forward a new way to improve the printability of TCP without the sacrifice of the compressive strength and printing precision. Our results showed that after incorporating PVA into the pastes, the printing temperature could be lower than the control group (0% PVA). Besides, after comparing the microscopy images and compressive tests of all the Gel-PVA-TCP scaffolds, we found that our methods didn't influence the printing precision as well as the compressive strength of the scaffolds. In addition, no statistical difference was shown in the total porosity of Gel-PVA-TCP with different concentrations of PVA. Since the porosity is the important element of the mechanics characteristic, the similar porosity of the Gel-PVA-TCP in different group can also explain the similarity of the compressive strength. With the increment of the concentration of PVA, the viscosity of the printing pastes increased accordingly, which also accompanied with the increment of the extruded force within the syringe. It has been reported that alter cement rheology improved the injectability [7]. In our study, incorporating PVA (5%, 10%, and 15%) improved the rheology of TCP as well as the extruding force. There have been other underlining mechanisms, including alteration of the zeta potential of cement particles [25] and setting reaction [11], in these printing pastes. Many studies have used both experimental and theoretical approaches [26–28] to explore the injecting mechanisms and methods to enhance injectability. In short, the literature during extrusion proposes three mechanisms: A. Filtration in the needle (or die land), where the pressure exerted on the liquid phase causes it to flow along the die land more quickly than the solid, exacerbated with the formation of solid mats [29]. B. Filtration in the barrel, where the pressure exerted by the plunger on the paste causes the liquid phase to redistribute and the solids to undergo consolidation [30]. C. Local suction at the barrel exit driven by the dilation of the solids matrix as it flows into the nozzle [31]. The surface of the materials, like roughness, stiffness, and pore size (porosity) influence the cell behavior, including cell adhesion, proliferation, and production of matrix and protein [32–34]. In this study, the scaffolds incorporated different concentrations of PVA had different sizes of micropore after sintering. This was mainly due to the weight loss of PVA at high temperatures (Fig. 2B). During the process of sintering, PVA and gelatin were burnt to ash and different sizes of micropores were left on the scaffold. It has been reported that MG63 osteoblast-like cells were easily adhered to and spread on the PC membrane with 0.2–1.0 μm compared to the cells culture on the large micropore membrane with 3.0–8.0 μm [21]. Their studies revealed that the MG63 cells on smaller micropore sizes (0.2–1.0 μm) adhered and spread well, revealing spindle-shaped shapes in cellular morphology. Natural bone and blood vessel walls have a nanostructured surface, as they are composed of nanometer-sized ECM proteins [35,36]. Nanostructured surfaces have increased surface energy compared to a flat surface, which improves the hydrophilicity of the material and enhances the adhesion of proteins, further promoting the attachment of cells [37]. In the case of titanium, a 0.7% change in its surface area can induce a 10% increase in its surface energy [38]. Similarly, an increase in surface roughness of polymer substrates, such as polyurethane, can enhance the attachment and growth of vascular cells including endothelial cells and blood vessel smooth muscle cells [39,40]. Consistent with their studies, we found that increasing number io cells adhering to 5 and 10% PVA (1.53 and 2.59microns, with more adhering to 2.59 than 1.53). Though great effect we had made, there are still some limitations in our study. We have improved the injectability of TCP by incorporating PVA, but the underlying mechanism is still unknown. We have done lots of experiments to verify our hypothesis, including phase separation and reducing the setting time of cement. A more detailed understanding of the mechanism and dominant drivers is still lacking, albeit recent studies have increased understanding of the occurrence of phase separation during extrusion of TCP pastes [41–43]and progressive hardening (setting) of the cement paste [44,45]. To clarify the mechanism may be beyond our ability and this needs further researches. In addition, in the cells experiment, we only calculated the cell area on the surface of the scaffolds."
26,Conclusion,"In this work, we fabricated novel Gel-PVA-TCP scaffolds by 3D printing. Compared with the origin group TCP scaffolds (0% PVA), incorporating different concentrations of PVA improved the printability of TCP significantly, without affecting compressive strength and printing precision. What's more, after sintering the scaffolds, the scaffolds with different concentrations of PVA exhibited different microstructure on the surface of the scaffolds. These differences in the microstructure significantly improved the behavior of the cells adhering to scaffolds. Thus, incorporating PVA into TCP pastes hold great promise for uses in minimally invasive techniques and 3D printing techniques, especially in the field of the preparation of biological ceramics implants."
