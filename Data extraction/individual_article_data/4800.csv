0,Introduction,"The design of catalytic active sites for the selective activation of CO bonds is one of the most critical challenges in heterogeneous catalysis [1–5]. Glycerol (GL) is produced in increasingly large quantities as a by-product of the production of biodiesel and is an attractive potential precursor for the manufacture of a variety of high-value-added compounds [6–9], mainly via processes such as catalytic oxidation in air [10]. However, glycerol contains both primary and secondary alcohol groups, and a variety of products can be obtained by its oxidation [11–15]. Therefore, developing catalysts for the selective oxidation of glycerol to afford specific target products is a considerable challenge. Selective oxidation of the secondary alcohol group in glycerol affords dihydroxyacetone (DHA), which is in demand as the main active ingredient in sunless tanning products. Intensive efforts have been devoted to preparing efficient catalysts for this process [16–18]. Bimetallic Pt- or Pd-based catalysts have shown reasonable selectivity, but significant concomitant oxidation of the primary alcohol groups was still observed [19–23]. Au is generally considered a more selective catalyst than Pt or Pd in the oxidation of alcohols [24–29]. For example, Xu and co-workers have prepared a series of Au/metal oxide (MO x ) composite materials and demonstrated that they are promising catalysts for the selective oxidation of glycerol to DHA [30]. However, to optimize the efficiency of such Au-based heterogeneous catalysts in the selective oxidation of the secondary alcohol group in glycerol, it is necessary to investigate in detail the structure of the catalytic sites involved. Although it is well known that a strong metal–support interaction (SMSI) can be present in Au–metal oxide systems and that this SMSI can have a significant influence on the geometric and electronic structures of Au [31–36], it is our view that the role of the Au–support interface in modifying the catalytic activity of Au-based catalysts has too often been overlooked. In this work, a series of catalysts composed of Au nanoparticles (NPs) supported on ZnO have been prepared and employed in the catalytic oxidation of glycerol. The interactions between Au and ZnO are tailored using different preparation methods. The nature of the catalytically active sites in the resulting different Au-based catalysts has been investigated in detail, in order to identify the features that favor the selective oxidation of the secondary alcohol group in glycerol. The results of this work offer the possibility of enhancing the properties of future Au/MO x catalysts for the specific oxidation of glycerol, as well as other biopolyols."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Chemicals covering Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, urea, HAuCl4·3H2O, PdCl2, AgNO3, N1, N1-diethylbenzene-1,4-diamine sulfate, and POD (horseradish peroxidase) were all of A.R. grade. Glycerol (98.00 wt.%), NaBH4 of purity >96%, and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA; Mw = 13,000–23,000) were used. Deionized water was kept at a conductivity less than 10−6 S/cm."
3,Preparation of Au/ZnO catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of Au/ZnO catalysts The ZnO support was synthesized by a hydrothermal process as follows: Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (8.33 g) and urea (3.36 g) were dissolved in 70 mL distilled water under stirring and ultrasonic irradiation, and were then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave in a stainless steel jar and heated to 120 °C for 6 h. Afterward, the obtained precipitate was washed by centrifugation until the pH of the upper distilled water reached 7. After drying at 60 °C for 12 h, the precipitate was annealed in air at 500 °C for another 4 h to obtain a ZnO support. An Au/ZnO catalyst with 1.5 wt.% loading was prepared by the deposition–precipitation (DP) method. ZnO support (0.60 g) was added to 70 mL aqueous solution of urea (0.42 M), followed by the addition of 2.08 mL of a solution of HAuCl4·3H2O (21.95 mmol/L). The mixture was kept at 90 °C for 4 h with strong stirring. Afterward, it was cooled to room temperature (RT), followed by centrifugation and washing in deionized water until pH was 7 and no there was Cl− residual (detected by AgNO3). The precipitate was then annealed under different atmospheres (air, 10 vol.% H2/N2, and 100 vol.% N2) at 300 °C for 4 h at a slow heating rate (2.0 °C/min). Based on the pretreatment atmosphere, the obtained catalysts were denoted as Au/ZnODP-Air, Au/ZnODP-H, and Au/ZnODP-N. Au/ZnODP-H and Au/ZnODP-N were pretreated in air at 300 °C for another 4 h, and the obtained catalysts were denoted as Au/ZnODP-H-Air and Au/ZnODP-N-Air. Au/ZnO catalyst with 1.5 wt.% loading was also prepared by the sol-immobilization (Sol) method. Briefly, a 3.47 mL solution of HAuCl4·3H2O (21.95 mmol/L) was added to a 10 mL solution of PVA (PVA/metal (wt./wt.) = 1.2). After the mixture was stirred for 10 min, 5 mL of freshly prepared NaBH4 (NaBH4/metal (mol/mol) = 5) was added to form a dark brown sol. After 30 min, the formed sol was immobilized on a 1.0 g ZnO support under vigorous stirring conditions. The slurry was filtered after 1 h immobilization and the catalyst was washed thoroughly with alcohol and warm distilled water. The precipitate was dried (at 80 °C for 12 h) and the obtained product was denoted as Au/ZnOSol. Au/ZnOSol was further pretreated in air or under N2 at 300 °C for 4 h with a 2.0 °C/min heating rate to obtain Au/ZnOSol-Air and Au/ZnOSol-N catalyst."
4,The catalytic oxidation of glycerol,"2.3 The catalytic oxidation of glycerol Experiments were carried out in a glass round-bottomed reaction vessel (total volume ca. 50 mL). In a typical reaction, 5 mL of glycerol solution (0.1 M) and a certain amount of catalysts were loaded into the reaction vessel, which was then operated under 0.1 MPa pure O2 after purging with O2 for 1 min. The glycerol/Au molar ratio was 200 or 100. The reaction vessel was put onto a device that was preheated to 80 °C with continuous magnetic stirring at 800 rpm; then a zero reaction time was taken. After the reaction, the reaction vessel was cooled immediately in cold water, and the mixture sample was centrifuged to separate the solid catalyst. Product analysis was performed on a Shimadzu high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) equipped with a Zorbax SAX column, UV (220 nm), and refractive index detection. Operation was conducted at 31 °C for product separation with 0.1 wt.% H3PO4 aqueous solution (flow 0.2 mL/min) and pure acetonitrile (flow 0.4 mL/min) as eluent. For quantification, an external calibration method was used. Moreover, the produced gas in the reaction vessel was collected and qualitatively analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a packed column (2 M × 1/8 SS Porapak N 80/100 Shimadzu), a methanizer unit, and a TCD and FID detector. CO2 and HCHO were identified as the gas products of the reactions. The carbon balance which keeps at 100 ± 9% at high glycerol conversion (>75%) and at 100 ± 5% at low glycerol conversion (<75%). The conversion, product selectivity, yield, and TOF were calculated by the following equations: GL conversion % = moles of glycerol converted / moles of glycerol in feed × 100 , products electivity ( % ) = moles of product formed / moles of glycerol converted × 100 , product yield ( % ) = GL conversion ( % ) × product selectivity ( % ) / 100 , TOF = mol glycerol converted / [ mol surface Au atoms × time ( h ) ] , where the calculation of surface Au atoms is based on the Au particle size, surface Au atoms = 0.90 d - 0.7 , in which d is the size of Au particles observed in high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Similar models are detailed in the literature [37,38]."
5,Catalyst characterization,"2.4 Catalyst characterization An inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES, Model Shimadzu ICPS-7500) was a reliable way to determine the content of Au in the Au/ZnO catalysts. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Au/ZnO catalysts were recorded using a powder diffractometer (Shimadzu XRD-600 X-ray). Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) was conducted on a Micromeritics Surface Area and Porosity Gemini VII 2390. The size distributions and morphologies of Au nanoparticles were determined using JEOL JEM-2100F high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were performed on a FEI Titan Themis microscope fitted with aberration correctors for the probe-forming lens and imaging lens and a Super-X EDX system. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo VG ESCALAB250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The data were calibrated using the C1s binding energy at 284.6 eV, and then Au4f was analyzed by an XPS peak 4.1. Three tests were carried out over Au/ZnO catalysts to calculate the value of the Au/Zn surface ratio. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Vector 22 spectrometer using a sample pellet technique (30 mg of sample). Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was performed during Micrometric ChemiSorb 2720 chemisorption, in which 0.1 g catalysts was loaded into a U-type quartz tube. TPR was conducted under a stream of 10 vol.% H2/Ar to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min and a total flow rate of 40 mL/min. Raman spectroscopy was carried out using He–Ne laser excitation at 532 nm with a Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRAM ARAMIS Raman spectrometer. Diffuse reflection UV–Vis spectra over Au/ZnO catalysts were obtained using a UV-3600 spectrophotometer. In situ CO FTIR spectroscopy was carried out using a Bruker Tensor 27 instrument equipped with a MCT detector and a BaF2 window. Approximately 30 mg Au/ZnO catalyst was loaded into the round slice and pretreated with He (30 mL/min, heating rate 5 °C/min) at 120 °C for 60 min. After the temperature was lowered to 25 °C, a background spectrum was collected at a resolution of 4 cm−1. Subsequently, the sample was exposed to a flowing mixture of 99.9 vol.% CO at a rate of 30 mL/min for 30 min. The sample was then swept in He with a rate of 30 mL/min for 3 min; then the spectrum was collected. In situ FTIR of adsorbed glycerol spectrum was recorded with a resolution of 4 cm−1 in the range 4000–400 cm−1. The above instrument was then equipped with a Pfeiffer HiPace 80 molecular pump. The sample was pretreated under vacuum at 250 °C for 60 min; then the background spectrum was collected at less than 10−6 kPa after cooling to 25 °C. Glycerol was introduced into the sample under high vacuum for 30 min (saturated vapor pressure of glycerol at 20 °C is 0.4 kPa). Finally, the spectrum was collected at 25 °C after being pretreated in vacuum (less than 10−6 kPa) for 30 min. To verify the formation of H2O2, a fresh mixed solution containing phosphate buffer, N1, N1-diethylbenzene-1,4-diamine sulfate (DPD), and POD was added into the reacted solution without catalyst and the referential samples to observe change in color [39], and the absorbance at 551 nm was also measured by a UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV 5100B)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalytic performance of Au/ZnO catalysts,"3.1 Catalytic performance of Au/ZnO catalysts Two different Au/ZnO catalysts were prepared using sol-immobilization (Au/ZnOSol) and deposition–precipitation (DP) with pretreatment in air (Au/ZnODP-Air). The XRD patterns of the two Au/ZnO catalysts show the same diffraction peaks of ZnO and no diffraction peaks characteristic of Au (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Information) [40]. Moreover, these two Au/ZnO catalysts have similar Au loadings, surface areas, and average particle sizes (Table S1 and Fig. S2). The catalysts were employed in the catalytic gaseous oxidation of aqueous glycerol solutions under base-free conditions. As shown in Fig. 1 A, no glycerol conversion is observed in the first hour over Au/ZnOSol, and the conversion is still below 3% after 6 h. In contrast, the Au/ZnODP-Air catalyst shows excellent activity for glycerol oxidation under base-free conditions, with very high selectivities for DHA (62.1–95.9%). Consumption rates of glycerol are normalized to the surface Au atoms, and the measured glycerol turnover frequency (TOF) over Au/ZnODP-Air is as high as 191.1 h−1, whereas that over Au/ZnOSol is only 15.1 h−1 (shown in Tables S2 and S3). After reaction for 6 h with Au/ZnODP-Air, the conversion of glycerol is 75.7%, with a 62.1% selectivity for DHA. When the molar glycerol/Au ratio is 100:1, the yield of DHA using the Au/ZnODP-Air catalyst is as high as 51.5% (Table S2). We also test the catalytic performance of the two catalysts at different glycerol/metal ratios (Figs. S3 and S4), and the results show that no obvious deactivation of catalyst happens at a lower glycerol/Au molar ratio and the mass transfer resistance is not involved at our conditions. Fig. 1B shows a comparison of the catalytic results for glycerol oxidation in the absence and presence of NaOH. In the absence of Au, the ZnO support is nearly inactive under our conditions in both cases. For both Au/ZnOSol and Au/ZnODP-Air, addition of base has significant effects on both the product distributions and yields, as shown in Fig. 1B. The glycerol conversion over Au/ZnOSol is dramatically improved from 3.7% (NaOH-free) to 95.3% (with NaOH), while the conversion over Au/ZnODP-Air is slightly increased from 86.4% to 95.6% (details in Table S2). The product selectivities are also highly dependent on the presence of base. In the case of Au/ZnODP-Air, although DHA is the major product in the absence of base, the main products under basic conditions are glyceraldehyde (GLD) and glyceric acid (GLA) produced by the oxidation of primary alcohol groups in glycerol and glycolic acid (GCA). A comparison of the data in Fig. 1B thus shows that the high DHA selectivity could be achieved over Au/ZnO catalyst only under the base-free conditions. To investigate whether the differences between the two catalysts can be attributed to the pretreatment step in the preparation of Au/ZnODP-Air involved in the structure of the catalytic sites, the Au/ZnOSol catalyst was treated in air and under N2 (the resulting materials are denoted Au/ZnOSol-Air and Au/ZnOSol-N, respectively). As shown in Table 1 , unexpectedly, treatment in air resulted in a significant increase in catalytic activity, with glycerol conversion (after 5 h) increasing from 3.7% for Au/ZnOSol to 62.3% for Au/ZnOSol-Air. The main products were DHA and GCA (the chain scission oxidation product of DHA). To obtain further insight, we pretreated the Au/ZnODP precursor in 10 vol.% H2/N2 and 100 vol.% N2 and compared the catalytic properties of the resulting materials (denoted as Au/ZnODP-H and Au/ZnODP-N, respectively) with those of the material treated in air (Au/ZnODP-Air). Both Au/ZnODP-H and Au/ZnODP-N catalysts were almost inactive. However, interestingly, when Au/ZnODP-H and Au/ZnODP-N were subsequently treated in air at 300 °C for 4 h, the catalytic activity increased significantly and was comparable to that of Au/ZnODP-Air. These results suggest that pretreatment of the catalyst in air is the key factor in generating active sites with high specific selectivity for the oxidation of the secondary alcohol group in glycerol. Generally, the generation of glycolic acid is attributed to the formed H2O2 in the catalytic cycle, which could result in the CC break [41–43]. Therefore, a fresh mixed solution containing phosphate buffer, DPD, and POD was added into the samples to detect H2O2. As shown in Fig. S5 and Table 2 , the absorbance of reacted solution at 5 h is located between samples containing 25 ppm H2O2 and 0.1 M H2O2. Moreover, the possible distraction caused by the reactant and/or product in the solution is also checked. Samples with 0.1 M glycerol and 0.1 M glycolic acid show negative absorbance. Though an absorbance of 0.100 was obtained over the 0.11 M DHA sample (higher than the theoretical 0.1 M DHA in the reacted solution), it is still much lower than that of the reacted solution, indicating that H2O2 is indeed formed in the catalytic cycle over the Au/ZnODP-Air catalyst."
8,Geometric characteristics of Au/ZnODP-Air,"3.2 Geometric characteristics of Au/ZnODP-Air To probe the effect of treatment of the catalyst in air, the Au/ZnODP-Air catalyst was studied by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). Close inspection of images at atomic resolution indicates an intriguing feature: the Au NPs in Au/ZnODP-Air are covered by a thin layer of another material (Fig. 2 C). The mapping elemental scans of Au (red) and Zn (green) (Fig. 2D and 2E, respectively) suggest that the thin layer covering the Au NPs is most likely to be composed of amorphous ZnO species, presumably formed by migration from the ZnO support during oxidative pretreatment. Through STEM and HRTEM images (Fig. S6), we observe that the surface of Au/ZnOSol is smooth. After air treatment of Au/ZnOSol, PVA is partially removed (Fig. S7), and the average Au nanoparticles increase in size (from 2.7 to 21.2 nm). Meanwhile, the ZnO layer emerges on the surface of Au nanoparticles (Fig. S8), which is similar to that in the Au/ZnODP-Air catalyst. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to observe the changes in the surface atomic ratio of Au and Zn after treatment under different atmospheres. As shown in Fig. S9 and Table S4, the atomic ratio of Au/Zn was 0.293 ± 0.006 in Au/ZnODP-Air, which is lower than the corresponding values in Au/ZnODP-N (0.339 ± 0.005) and Au/ZnODP-H (0.368 ± 0.008). These results are consistent with the Au NPs in Au/ZnODP-Air being covered by a ZnO layer, as observed in the STEM image, and confirm that pretreatment in an oxidative atmosphere results in the formation of Au/ZnO interface [44,45]."
9,Nature of the Au/ZnO interface,"3.3 Nature of the Au/ZnO interface FTIR spectra were recorded to examine the Au/ZnO interface. In Fig. 3 A and Fig. S10, we can observe that the peak of ZnO vibration over the Au/ZnODP-Air catalyst strengthens and shifts toward low wavenumber compared with those for other samples, which means that the electronic environment of ZnO in the bulk of ZnO changes to some extent. Together with the HRTEM result, we consider that Au could interact with overlayer ZnO species. The H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2 TPR) of samples is shown in Fig. 3B. The high-temperature peaks (350 and 550 °C) can be assigned to the reduction of the lattice oxygen of the ZnO. More importantly, all Au/ZnO samples have broad low-temperature peaks (<200 °C), corresponding to the reduction of Auδ+ (Fig. 3B), but the peak for Au/ZnODP-Air is shifted to lower temperature than that for Au/ZnODP-N, with the temperature of the peak for Au/ZnODP-N after pretreatment in air for 1 h being intermediate between those for Au/ZnODP-Air and pristine ZnO. Meanwhile, we can see that the temperature of the reduction peak in Au/ZnOsol is also a little higher than that of Au/ZnODP-Air (Fig. S11). These results indicate that the interaction of Au and ZnO is not the same over samples, and Au/ZnODP-Air catalyst has more reducible species generation, which may be related to the formation of the ZnO overlayer and the Au/ZnO interface [46–48]. As shown in Fig. 4 , DR UV–vis spectroscopy was also used to investigate the structural properties of the Au/ZnO catalysts. The band at 450–650 nm corresponds to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of Au nanoparticles. The peak maximum shifts from 550 nm in Au/ZnODP-H and Au/ZnODP-N to 560 nm in Au/ZnODP-Air and also becomes broader. This red shift suggests that the electron would transfer from Au to the support due to the remodeling of ZnO on the surface of Au under air treatment, agreeing with the reported results [49–55]. All the above results suggest that thermal treatment under different atmospheres (oxidative, reductive, or inert) can significantly affect the chemical state of the active sites in the Au/ZnO catalyst. Further support for this conclusion is provided by in situ FTIR spectroscopy of CO adsorption (Fig. S12), which shows that a new type of Au site is introduced by oxidative calcination, and may be connected to the presence of Au species in the Au/ZnO interface. The Raman spectrum of the ZnO support (Fig. 5 ) shows sharp and strong peaks at ca. 435 cm−1 (E2(high) mode) and 328 cm−1 (2E2(low) mode), indicating that it has good crystallinity. In the spectrum of Au/ZnODP-Air, an additional very strong broad peak is observed at 580 cm−1. This peak can be assigned to a quasi-LO mode and has been attributed to intrinsic host-lattice defects [56]. However, the intensity of the corresponding peak in the spectrum of Au/ZnOsol is extremely low, and a similar trend is also observed over Au/ZnODP-H and Au/ZnODP-N (Fig. S13). This suggests that in this material, the high lattice energy prevents the Au centers from being incorporated into the highly crystalline ZnO lattice, and the Au is located on the surface of the ZnO support. In contrast, during the thermal treatment step in the preparation of Au/ZnODP-Air, Au can be inserted into the ZnO lattice at the Au/ZnO interface and replace part of the Zn2+ to form Au–O–Zn linkages [57]. Due to the charge mismatch, this process also results in the formation of oxygen vacancy defects (V o). Fig. 6 A shows the in situ infrared Fourier transform spectra of CO adsorbed onto Au/ZnOSol and Au/ZnODP-Air. No significant adsorption of CO is observed in the case of Au/ZnOSol, but for Au/ZnODP-Air, strong absorption bands of CO can be observed at 2067, 2041, and 1972 cm−1. The bands at 2041 and 1972 cm−1 can be attributed to νsym and νasym vibrations, respectively, of gem dicarbonyl species Au(CO)2, while the peak at 2067 cm−1 could result from linear adsorption of CO onto Au at step/kink sites (denoted as Austep–CO) [58–61]. As for Au/ZnOSol-Air, we can see an obvious CO adsorption peak after the air treatment (Fig. S14). It is important to note that there is a shoulder peak at 2067 cm−1, similar to the results over Au/ZnODP-Air. These infrared spectra, together with those shown in Fig. S12, confirm that thermal treatment of Au/ZnO results in the formation of new catalytic Au–O–Zn centers that are capable of adsorbing CO. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out to investigate the electronic environment of Au in the different materials. As illustrated in Fig. 6B and Table S5, peaks at 82.9, 83.5, and 85.3 eV relating to Au0, Au+, and Au3+ species are observed in the spectra of both Au/ZnOSol and Au/ZnODP-Air [62,63]. However the relative abundances of these species differ significantly (Table S5). The majority of Au on the surface of Au/ZnOSol exists as Au0 (71.5%), with smaller amounts of positively charged Au+ (16.5%) and Au3+ (12.0%) species. However, in Au/ZnODP-Air, the proportion of Au0 is significantly lower (55.5%), and the amounts of Au+ (21.2%) and Au3+ (23.3%) are correspondingly larger. This is further evidence of the formation of an Au–O–Zn interface in Au/ZnODP-Air. However, it is considered that the catalytic cycle should not be completed under the individual participation of cationic gold in the catalyst, because of the poor activity of Au/ZnOSol in glycerol oxidation. Direct evidence of the origin of the enhanced activity of Au/ZnODP-Air in the catalytic oxidation of the secondary alcohol group in glycerol is provided by in situ FTIR spectra of glycerol adsorbed onto ZnO, Au/ZnOSol, and Au/ZnODP-Air (Fig. 7 ). Generally, glycerol forms multidentate alkoxy species on oxide surfaces via coordinatively unsaturated (CUS) metal atoms, and such interactions result in significant changes in the FTIR spectra. For bulk glycerol, the νCO peaks corresponding to the secondary and primary alcohol groups occur at 1108 and 1030 cm−1, respectively. When glycerol was adsorbed onto the ZnO support in the absence of Au, the νCO peaks observed at 1046 and 1022 cm−1 could be attributed to bridging alkoxy bonds formed by one primary alcohol group with two CUS surface Zn atoms (α interaction) and the other primary alcohol group with one CUS surface Zn atom (γ interaction), while the peak at 1132 cm−1 is assigned to the νCO mode of the secondary alcohol group [64]. When Au is incorporated into the solid, giving Au/ZnOSol and Au/ZnODP-Air, the primary alcohol regions of the IR spectra of glycerol adsorbed on the two solids are very similar to that for ZnO. In contrast, the νCO mode of the secondary alcohol peak is blue shifted from 1132 cm−1 for ZnO to 1141 cm−1 for Au/ZnOSol. This suggests that the νCO mode of the secondary alcohol peak is only slightly affected by the electronegativity of the Au atom, by virtue of the weak adsorption of glycerol. However when glycerol is adsorbed onto Au/ZnODP-Air, the νCO peak is much more significantly blue shifted to 1155 cm−1, which can be attributed to the formation of a bridging alkoxy bond by the secondary alcohol group at the CUS located at the Au/ZnO interface. In addition, due to the inductive electronic effects caused by the strong adsorption of the secondary alcohol group onto the Au/ZnO interface, the νCH peak for Au/ZnODP-Air is split into three peaks at 2934, 2906, and 2869 cm−1. These results show that the secondary alcohol group in glycerol can be specifically adsorbed and activated on the Au/ZnO interface."
10,Reaction kinetics,"3.4 Reaction kinetics To investigate the heterogeneous nature of catalytic reaction, a Sheldon hot filtration was performed and the catalyst was removed from the reaction mixture after 1 h of reaction. As shown in Fig. 8 , no further changes in conversion are observed after another 5 h of reaction, which is different from the case with the catalyst. This result obviously indicates that no leaching of catalyst is involved in the reaction and the catalytic reaction is happening over Au/ZnODP-Air catalyst. It is important that kinetic study should be based on rate measurements involving no mass or heat transfer effects. Therefore, we studied the effect of stirring speeds (600–1000 rpm) on glycerol oxidation over the Au/ZnODP-Air catalyst (Fig. S15). The result shows that the conversion is almost constant at low glycerol conversion (<30%). Moreover, Mears and Weisz–Prater analyses were also employed for the highest observed rates at 80 °C to identify any mass transfer limitations in our system (details listed in Table S6). The calculated values of the Mears criterion [65–66], - r A ' ρ b Rn k c C Ab = 1.39 × 10 - 6 × 1000 × 1.3 × 10 - 7 × 1 9.39 × 10 - 3 × 0.1 = 1.92 × 10 - 7 < 0.15 , imply that external mass transfer effects can be neglected. The calculated values of the Weisz–Prater criterion, C wp = - r A ' ρ b R 2 C Ab D e = 1.39 × 10 - 6 × 1000 × (1.3 × 10 - 7 ) 2 0.1 × 1.34 × 10 - 12 = 1.75 × 10 - 4 < 1 , imply that internal mass transfer effects can be neglected. A kinetic study was then carried out over Au/ZnODP-Air catalyst. Fig. S16A shows the effect of glycerol concentration on activity and selectivity at 80 °C and 0.1 MPa O2. At low conversion (<15%) of glycerol, the reaction order was estimated to be 0.59 with respect to glycerol concentrations from the linear range (Fig. 9 A). Fig. S16B shows the effect of O2 pressures on the activities and selectivity for glycerol oxidation. At 80 °C and 0.1 M glycerol, the activity increased almost linearly from 0.02 to 0.14 MPa. The reaction order was estimated to be 0.45 with respect to O2 pressure from the linear range (Fig. 9B). The observed near half-order dependence of the glycerol oxidation activities on the glycerol and O2 concentrations suggests that the glycerol oxidation follows a Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism, including the dissociative chemisorption of glycerol and O2 on the active sites of the catalyst to form the corresponding adsorbed intermediates [67]. As reported [68–70], the formation of OOH* is a critical elementary step in the formation of H2O2, which was detected in Section 3.1, while both FTIR and theoretical studies have revealed the enhanced activation of O2 in the presence of H2O through approach by the adsorbed OOH* species on gold [71–74]. Therefore, we hold that the OOH* species is present from O2 in our reaction system. Based on the results of in situ glycerol-FTIR, we consider that R2CHO* would be formed on the vacancy defects at the Au/ZnO interface [75–77]. Moreover, the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of both secondary and primary alcohol oxidation has confirmed that the catalytic activation of the CH bond is the rate-determining step in the selective oxidation reaction [30,67,78]."
11,Proposed mechanism over Au/ZnO interface,"3.5 Proposed mechanism over Au/ZnO interface Based on the above detailed characterization and catalytic tests, it can be concluded that the presence of the Au/ZnO interface is the key factor responsible for the specific catalytic oxidation of glycerol to DHA using Au/ZnODP-Air under base-free conditions. Therefore, we propose a possible mechanism for glycerol oxidation over the Au/ZnODP-Air catalyst (Scheme 1 ) and a sequence of elementary steps for the glycerol oxidation on Au/ZnODP-Air (Scheme 2 ). The reaction is preceded by the dissociative chemisorption of O2 on Au (denoted as *) to form atomic oxygen (O*) species (Step 1). Peroxide (OOH*) species and hydroxyl (OH*) species can be formed via the combination of O* species and H2O. OH* and O* can also be formed via the decomposition of OOH* species (Steps 2 and 3). Meanwhile, the secondary alcohol group of glycerol is adsorbed dissociatively onto vacancy defects (denoted as *) at the Au/ZnO interface to form the adsorbed alcoholate ((R2)CHO*) and hydrogen (H*) species (Step 4). The subsequent abstraction of a hydrogen atom from (R2)CHO* via its reaction with OOH* is irreversible and kinetically relevant, leading to the concurrent formation of the adsorbed ((R2)CO*) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2*) species (Step 5). The OH* species would further react with H* to generate the adsorbed water (H2O*) (Step 8). Finally, (R2)CO*, H2O2* and H2O* readily desorb from vacancy defects and Au at the Au/ZnO interface to complete the catalytic cycle (Steps 6, 7, and 9). According to this proposed sequence and the assumption of a pseudo-steady state for all chemisorbed species, the rate equation of glycerol oxidation over Au/ZnODP-Air was as described in the equation (1) More details are explained in the Supplementary Material. In this equation, each term in the denominator represents the surface coverage of the indicated adsorbed species relative to that of the vacancy defects and Au at the Au/ZnO interface, while K 1, K -6, K -7, and K -9 stand for the equilibrium constants for O2, (R)2CO, H2O2, and H2O, adsorption, respectively. Moreover, M 1, M 2, M 3, and M 4 were taken by the integration of the rate and equilibrium constants for the elementary steps in the equations (2) M 1 = K 1 3 · K 2 · K 3 1 2 (3) M 2 = K 1 - 3 4 · k 4 · k 5 · k 3 1 2 · k 2 - 1 2 (4) M 3 = K 1 3 4 · k 2 1 2 · k 3 - 1 2 (5) M 4 = K 1 K 2 K 3 - 2 1 · k 2 · k 8 . Based on the observed kinetic dependence on glycerol concentration and O2 pressure, the surface coverages of the intermediates O*, OOH*, H*, OH*, H2O2*, H2O*, and (R2)CO* species are generally regarded as much smaller than those of (R2)CHO*, OOH*, and free active sites (*) at the Au/ZnO interface sites under the reaction conditions. Therefore, Eq. (1) could be simplified as (6) r = k 4 · [ ( R ) 2 C H O H ] 1 + M 2 · R 2 C H O H O 2 3 4 · H 2 O 1 2 + M 3 · O 2 3 4 · H 2 O 1 2 2 , and the parameters could be calculated by nonlinear regression analysis of the measured glycerol oxidation activities (Fig. S16) and are shown in Table 3 , from which the following equation is obtained: (7) r = 3197.6 · [ ( R ) 2 C H O H ] ( 1 + 2.89 · R 2 C H O H O 2 3 4 · H 2 O 1 2 + 0.076 · O 2 3 4 · H 2 O 1 2 ) 2 . Within the limits of glycerol concentration (0.1–0.3 mol/L) and O2 pressure (0.02–0.14 MPa), we calculated the glycerol oxidation rate and compared it with the measured rate. As shown in Fig. 10 , excellent agreement between these data is observed, demonstrating that Eq. (7) can accurately describe the observed experimental kinetic results and well supporting the proposed elementary steps and reaction mechanism in Scheme 1 over the Au/ZnODP-Air catalyst. In the case of the Au/ZnOSol catalyst, although the O2 can be activated on the surface of Au, due to the lack of vacancy defects at an Au/ZnO interface, the secondary alcohol group in glycerol cannot be adsorbed and activated, and hence the catalytic oxidation of glycerol to DHA is impossible."
12,Recyclability of catalyst,"3.6 Recyclability of catalyst It can be seen from Fig. 11 that the glycerol conversion decreased gradually in the recycling test. In the third use glycerol conversion decreased to 60%, while the selectivity of DHA did not change. It should be pointed out that the reused catalyst was pretreated with air at 300 °C due to the formation of zinc oxalate after the reaction (as shown in Fig. S17). Table S7 shows the catalytic performance of fresh Au/ZnODP-Air, the second-reused Au/ZnODP-Air (air-treated), and the after-use Au/ZnODP-Air (only washed after the first use). It clearly shows that the glycerol conversion over after-use Au/ZnODP-Air is lower than that over fresh Au/ZnODP-Air and the second-reused Au/ZnODP-Air sample, indicating that the formation of zinc oxalate may influence the Au/ZnO interface and then decrease the activity of the catalyst. Moreover, we find that the Au loading of the catalyst before and after the reaction has not changed (from 1.2% to 1.2%), indicating that no Au leaching happens after use, which is consistent with our Shelton hot filtration result. From the HRTEM and particle size statistics before and after second reuse of the catalyst (Fig. S18), we find the particle size of the catalyst changes from 2.63 to 3.51 nm and the particle size distribution range widens. This means that the Au particle undergoes agglomeration after reuse. The results of in situ FTIR spectra of adsorbed CO (Fig. S19) shows that the characteristic adsorption peak of Au at 2067 cm−1 weakens after use, indicating that the state of the Au active site also changes. The agglomeration of Au particles could be one of the reasons for the decrease of catalytic activity. Moreover, FTIR of the second-reused catalyst shows the residual of zinc oxalate, which may also weaken the catalytic performance."
13,Conclusions,"In summary, a catalyst containing an Au/ZnO interface has been prepared by thermal treatment in air. In the interface area, Au is inserted into the ZnO lattice to form Au–O–Zn linkages. Due to the charge mismatch, oxygen vacancy defects (V O) are also incorporated. The obtained Au/ZnODP-Air catalyst has been applied in the oxidation of glycerol; under base-free conditions, 86.4% glycerol conversion with 62.1% selectivity for DHA is achieved. The measured TOF of glycerol is as high as 191.1 h−1, whereas that over Au/ZnOSol is only 15.1 h−1. The results of in situ FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed glycerol and catalytic tests show that the Au/ZnO interface act as the active sites for the specific oxidation of secondary alcohol groups in glycerol under base-free conditions. Moreover, we consider that OOH* is involved in the abstraction of β-H in the secondary alcohol and this step is irreversible and kinetically relevant. According to the proposed mechanism, we calculate the activity of glycerol oxidation, which agree excellently with the measured TOF. Our results suggest that the fabrication of such interface structures is an effective strategy to realize the selective transformation of biomass-derived polyol."
