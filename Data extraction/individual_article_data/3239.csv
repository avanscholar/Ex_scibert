0,Introduction,"Water splitting (H2O→H+ +OH− [inside a bipolar membrane]) is the typical function of bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BMED) and has been widely used in food processing, chemical synthesis, and environmental protection [1–4]. In comparison, alcohol splitting (Alcohol→H+ +Alkoxide anion [inside a bipolar membrane]) has much fewer reports, but it is of great significance to green organic industry because it can supply alkoxide anions in a safe and environmentally friendly manner and simplify many organic syntheses (e.g., Claisen condensation and intramolecular Dickman condensation) [5–10]. However, the first obstacle to the industrialization of alcohol splitting is the unacceptable energy consumption for running BMED in the organic medium (e.g., methanol and ethanol). Notably, alcohols, different from water, have much higher electrical resistances even after supporting electrolytes are added. To further reduce the electrical resistance of alcohol, the general principal of EDI (electrodeionization) may be applied, i.e., adding ion-exchange resins in the solvent and making the resins a bridge to carry ions. Recently, this principal has achieved many successes in aqueous systems, such as producing high-purity water by CEDI (continuous electrodeionization) [11] and producing tartaric acid by adding strong acid resins in BMED [12]. This research will apply the principal of EDI to reduce the electrical resistance of an organic system, i.e., ion-exchange is integrated with BMED for alcohol splitting. In particular, methanol splitting in BMED is used to convert methyl chloroacetate into methyl methoxyacetate [9] (Eq. (1)), and 4 kinds of ion-exchange resins are filled in BMED, respectively. The effects of ion-exchange resins on the voltage drop, product yield, and current efficiency will be investigated. (1) ClCH2COOCH3 +CH3O− →CH3OCH2COOCH3 +Cl−"
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials A cation-exchange membrane (Neosepta CMX, Tokuyama Soda Inc., Japan), an anion-exchange membrane (FT-FAB, FuMA-Tech GmbH, Germany), and a bipolar membrane (Neosepta BP-1, Tokuyama Soda Inc., Japan) were used for experiments, and their properties are listed in Table 1 . D001 cation-exchange resins and D201 anion-exchange resins were supplied by Bengbu Tianxing Ion-exchange Resin Co., Ltd. (China). 001*7 and 201*7 resins were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China). The properties of the 4 kinds of ion-exchange resins are listed in Table 2 . Before use, the resins were converted to the H+ or OH− form firstly, then immersed in methanol for 24h, and filtrated under vacuum to remove methanol. The other chemicals were of analytical grade."
3,Setup,"2.2 Setup A BMED stack of BP-C-A configuration (Fig. 1 ) was chosen for laboratory-scale experiments, and ion-exchange resins were filled in the alkali compartment. This stack was composed of a bipolar membrane, a cation-exchange membrane, and an anion-exchange membrane between two electrodes, and the electrodes were connected with a direct current power supply (N5772A, Agilent Technologies, Co., Ltd.). Compartments were separated by Plexiglas spacers (thickness=1cm), and the solution in each compartment was circulated separately by a submersible pump (AP1000, Zhongshan Zhenhua Electronics Co., Ltd., China). The effective membrane area was 7.07cm2 and the electrodes were made of titanium coated with ruthenium. A methanol solution of LiNO3 (0.2moldm−3) was used as the supporting electrolyte in every compartment. 0.1moldm−3 ClCH2COOCH3 was used as the raw material for the production of methyl chloroacetate in all experiments. In the anode compartment, 2cm3 of H2O was added and thus the following reaction took place: 2H2O→4H+ +O2↑+4e; the cathode released hydrogen. Before each experiment, the equipment was dried and kept from moisture, and all the membranes were conditioned in a methanol solution of LiNO3 (0.2moldm−3) for 24h at room temperature before mounted into the stack."
4,Characterization of membranes and resins in methanol,"2.3 Characterization of membranes and resins in methanol 2.3.1 Ion exchange capacity in methanol (IEC) The cation-exchange membrane and cation-exchange resin were soaked in methanol solution of NaOH (0.01molL−1, 20mL) for 24h, respectively. Then, the solution was titrated with a 0.01molL−1 HCl standard solution. The IEC value was calculated according to the following equation: (2) IEC + = V NaOH × C NaOH − V HCl × C HCl w dry where w dry is the dry weight of the sample in the Na+ form; V NaoH =20mL; C NaOH =0.01molL−1; and C HCl is the concentration of the HCl solution (0.01molL−1); V HCl is the titrated volume of the HCl solution. For the anion-exchange membrane and anion-exchange resin, the IEC was measured the same as above. The IEC value was calculated according to the following equation: (3) IEC − = V HCl × C HCl − V NaOH × C NaOH w dry where w dry is the dry weight of the sample in the Cl− form; V HCl =20mL; C HCl =0.01molL−1; and C NaOH is the concentration of the NaOH solution (0.01molL−1); V NaOH is the titrated volume of the HCl solution. 2.3.2 Methanol content and swelling ratio The dried ion-exchange resins were weighed and immersed in methanol at 25°C for 2 days, then filtrated under vacuum to remove methanol. The methanol content W was calculated according to the following equation: (4) W = w wet − w dry w dry × 100 % where w wet and w dry are the wet and dry weights of the resins, respectively. The swelling ration of ion-exchange membranes was characterized by linear expansion ration (LER) [13], which was determined by the difference between wet and dry dimensions of a membrane sample (3cm in length and 1cm in width). The calculation was based on the following equation: (5) LER = L wet − L dry L dry × 100 % where L wet and L dry are the lengths of wet and dry membranes, respectively."
5,Determination of methyl methoxyacetate and lithium methoxide,"2.4 Determination of methyl methoxyacetate and lithium methoxide The qualitative and quantitative analyses of methyl methoxyacetate were performed using a gas chromatograph (6890N, Agilent Technologies, Co., Ltd.). The concentration of lithium methoxide was determined by titration."
6,Current efficiency,"2.5 Current efficiency The current efficiency η was calculated in Eq. (6) [14] (6) η = ( C t − C 0 ) z V F I t × 100 % where C t and C 0 are the methyl methoxyacetate concentrations at times t and 0, respectively, z is the ion chemical valence (z =1), V is the circulate volume of solution in the alkali cycle, I is the current, and F is the Faraday constant. In this work, t is equal to 2h, and the change of fluid volume in each cycle was negligible, that is, V =0.25L."
7,Results and discussion,
8,"IEC, methanol content, and swelling ratio","3.1 IEC, methanol content, and swelling ratio The main properties of the membranes and resins in methanol, such as IEC, methanol content, and swelling ration are listed in Table 3 . It can be seen that the IEC values of macroreticular resins are higher than that of gel-type resins, and the methanol content has the same changing trends as IEC. However, compared with IEC values in water, the IEC values of resins and membranes in methanol are very low. Both cation-exchange membrane and anion-exchange membrane were immersed in methanol at 25°C for 2 days, then the swelling ratio was measured. The results show that the cation-exchange membrane is not swelling, however, the linear expansion ratio (LER) of anion-exchange membrane is 5.3%."
9,Effect of ion-exchange resins on the stack voltage drop,"3.2 Effect of ion-exchange resins on the stack voltage drop Fig. 2 shows the variations of the stack voltage drop at the different current densities after different ion exchange resins are added in the alkali compartment, respectively. At the same current density, the voltage drops across the stack filled with ion-exchange resins are all much lower than those without resins. This is because ions move much faster inside an ion-exchange resin than in a bulk solution [15,16]. On the other hand, whether ion-exchange resins are added or not, the voltage–time curves present the similar changing trend. As current density increases, the voltage drop increases. When it comes to each curve, there is a sharp increase in the voltage drop at the beginning but a trend to level off afterwards. The sharp increases can have similar explanations as reported [8,17]: there is little current due to the increase in electrical resistance because ions are depleted in the intermediate layer of bipolar membrane. The stack voltage drop keeps approximately constant afterwards, indicating that the methanol splitting at this condition approaches a steady state. Table 4 gives a quantitative analysis on the effects of different resins on the stack voltage drop. In comparison, D201 has the largest capability to reduce the strop voltage drop while 001*7 has the lowest. Further, between ion-exchange resins of the same type, macroreticular resins have better performances than gel-type resins (D201>201*7; D001>001*7); between ion-exchange resins of the same structure, anion-exchange resins have better performances than cation-exchange resins (D201>D001, 201*7>001*7). This is because the D201 resins has larger IEC than D001 resins in the methanol solution, and the IEC of 201*7 resins is also larger than that of 001*7 resins. In order to investigate the effect of resin location on the stack voltage drop, D201 ion exchange resin was filled in the cathode compartment, instead of the alkali compartment. The voltage–time curves are shown in Fig. 3 . The stack voltage drop decreases largely after D201 is added; however, there is no significant difference when D201 is added in the alkali or cathode compartment. The reason may be that D201 has a close contribution to the enhancement on the mobilities of NO3 − and CH3O−. To sum up, whether resins are added in the alkali or cathode compartment, the stack voltage drop will decrease significantly, and it will make it possible for BMED to run under a moderate voltage drop."
10,Effect of supporting electrolyte on the stack voltage drop,"3.3 Effect of supporting electrolyte on the stack voltage drop Apart from ion-exchange resins, supporting electrolytes are also of significance to maintain a low voltage drop. According to Fig. 4 , at a current density of 10mAcm−2, the lowest stack voltage drop is achieved when LiNO3 and D201 are both added in the alkali compartment. If only LiNO3 is added, the voltage drop increases by 9.4–10.3V. If only D201 is added, the voltage drop increases by 22.2V in the initial 5min and decreases gradually as more current carriers (CH3O− and Cl−) are generated after methanol splitting."
11,Effect of ion-exchange resins on product yield and current efficiency,"3.4 Effect of ion-exchange resins on product yield and current efficiency Fig. 5 shows the CH3OCH2COOCH3 concentrations before and after different ion-exchange resins are filled in the alkali compartment at different current densities when the electrodialysis was operated 2h. Obviously, as current density increases, the concentration of CH3OCH2COOCH3 increases in all cases. In comparison, the product yield is the lowest when macroreticular resins are filled in the alkali compartment, and the highest yield is achieved when no resins are added. This should be attributed to the adsorption of CH3OCH2COOCH3 onto the resins. Since the macroreticular resin has larger pore sizes than the gel-type resin, so CH3OCH2COOCH3 can be easily adsorbed to the macroreticular resin, resulting in a lower concentration of CH3OCH2COOCH3. In order to investigate the adsorption capacity of ion-exchange resins, four different types of resins were immersed in methanol solution of 1.124gL−1 CH3OCH2COOCH3 for 2h, respectively. Table 5 shows the adsorption data of CH3OCH2COOCH3 onto the different resins. Apparently, the D001 resin has the largest adsorption capacity. The influence of resins on current efficiency is illustrated in Fig. 6 . Similarly, the current efficiency became lower after resins are filled in the alkali compartment. This is also a result of the adsorption of methyl methoxyacetate onto the resins. As for the low concentrations of methyl methoxyacetate, it was explained in the previous work [9]. Considering the influence of different resins on the stack voltage drop and product concentration, 201*7 (gel-type, anion-exchange resin) is the best choice for the production of methyl methoxyacetate."
12,Conclusions,"Although D201 is a macroreticular anion-exchange resin and has the largest capability to reduce the voltage drop, it also adsorbs more of the product and thus causes a decrease in product yield and current efficiency. As a compromise, 201*7 (gel-type, anion-exchange resin) should be chosen for the production of methyl methoxyacetate. Above all, filling ion-exchange resins is a good choice for reducing the stack voltage drop during the production of methyl methoxyacetate by running BMED in methanol. It will make it possible for BMED to run under a moderate voltage drop, and thus lower energy consumption and prolonged membrane lifetime can be guaranteed."
