0,Introduction,"As a response to the depletion of petroleum resources, increasing demand for oil and environmental concerns over greenhouse gas emissions, the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into fuels and chemicals is receiving much attention. Lignocellulose is the most important source of biomass, being a sustainable alternative obtainable from forest/agricultural residues, municipal wastes, and as a by-product of some industries. It mainly comprises cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Selective depolymerization of hemicellulose and cellulose provides sugars, which can be subsequently transformed into platform chemicals such as levulinic acid, 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (5-HMF) and furfural [1,2]. Among the biomass derived chemicals, furfuryl alcohol, coming from furfural hydrogenation, is an attractive intermediate compound for the production of levulinic acid, alkyl levulinate esters, alkyl furfuryl ethers and angelica lactones [3–5], which find numerous applications, either as themselves or as starting points for other synthetic routes. Likewise, furfural route (via xylose) is an interesting alternative to the use of glucose in terms of atom economy for the production of these bio-products. Furfuryl ethers are used as blending components of gasoline and as flavours [6,7]. Alkyl levulinates have strong potential to be used in various applications, substituting current chemicals produced through petro-chemical routes such as in the perfume and flavour industries, as blending agents for diesel fuel formulation, as plasticizers or solvents [8]. On the other hand, angelica lactones have been proposed for the preparation of fuel additives, useful flavours and cigarette additives [9]. Noticeably, levulinic acid has been identified by the U.S. Department of Energy as one of the top 12 most important biomass-derived platform chemicals. It is a versatile platform molecule that can be further reacted to produce a wide range of chemicals, polymers, fuel additives, agrochemicals, etc. [10]. In aqueous media, the hydration of furfuryl alcohol mediated by an acid results in the production of levulinic acid [10]. However, the substrate furfuryl alcohol is highly reactive under these conditions, leading to undesired oligomers formation by condensation [11]. Using an alcohol as solvent instead of water allows for minimizing the formation of oligomers, driving the reaction towards the formation of alkyl levulinate esters. However, side reactions such as alcohol consumption by auto-etherification – driven by the strong acid catalysts employed for this transformation – can be a serious drawback for this route. By the proper selection of catalyst and reaction conditions, this problem can be overcome. Many acid catalysts have been used for the conversion of furfuryl alcohol into bio-products. The use of heterogeneous acid catalysts has attracted much more attention than homogeneous mineral acids, because of the well-known drawbacks that the latter group presents. For instance, solid catalysts with sulfonic acid groups have been used for the transformation of furfuryl alcohol, such us sulfonic acid-functionalized carbon and carbon-silica composites [12], mesoporous silica [13], ion-exchange resins [14–16], and heteropoly acid supported catalysts [17,18]. Although high yields of levulinate are obtained, this kind of catalysts is not stable through typical regeneration by coke burn-off. Mesostructured zirconium-based mixed oxides containing tungsten and/or aluminium are also versatile solid acid catalysts for chemical valorisation of biomass, leading to high yields of bio-products [19]. Zeolite materials have also been tested in this reaction, displaying good results in terms of alkyl levulinate esters production when ethanol is used as solvent [14,16], though alkyl furfuryl ether, an intermediate compound, reveals as the main product with larger alcohols [3,4]. Therefore, many acid catalysts have previously demonstrated a suitable activity in the transformation of furfuryl alcohol into bio-products. Herein, a systematic analysis of the conversion of biomass-derived furfuryl alcohol into bio-products over a wide variety of heterogeneous acid catalysts and alcoholic media is presented. Evaluated acid catalysts include several zeolites with different framework topology and loading and strength of acid sites, sulfonic acid-functionalized materials (mesostructured silicas and resins) and sulfated zirconia. The main purpose of the current study is to settle the relationship between the physico-chemical properties of each catalyst, i.e. acid sites loading, strength and accessibility, and its catalytic performance. Moreover, a throughout mechanistic and kinetic modelling has been developed and discussed in order to determine the most favoured reactions for each catalyst."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Furfuryl alcohol (FOL, 98%), angelica lactone (LACT, 98%) and levulinic acid (LA, 98%) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. Methanol (99%), ethanol (99.9%) and 2-propanol (98%) were obtained from Scharlab. Decane (99%) was acquired from Across Organics and ethyl furfuryl ether (EFE, 97%) was supplied by Manchester Organics. All the chemicals were used as received without previous purification. Isopropyl levulinate (i-LEV) was synthesized by esterification of levulinic acid in 2-propanol with sulfuric acid as catalyst. Purification of the levulinate was accomplished following a previously described procedure [20]. After removal of 2-propanol by distillation under reduced pressure, the product mixture was dissolved in MTBE and extracted 3X with saturated KHCO3 solution and 3X with distilled water. The solution was dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 and then filtered to eliminate Na2SO4. Finally, solvent was removed by distillation under reduced pressure. Purification grade was assessed by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra. 1H NMR spectrum (400MHz, CDCl3): δ 4.97 (sep, J =6.3Hz, 1H), 2.72 (t, J =6.7Hz, 2H), 2.52 (dt, J =0.4, 6.7Hz, 2H), 2.17 (s, 3H), 1.2 (d, J =6.3Hz, 6H) ppm; 13C NMR spectrum (100MHz, CDCl3): δ 206.98 (CH3C(O)–), 172.45 (–C(O)OiPr), 68.18 (–C(CH2)CH2), 38.19 (CH3C(O)C–), 30.07 (CH3C(O)CH2C–), 28.58 (CH3C(O)–), 21.96 (–C(CH2)CH2) ppm. Propylsulfonic functionalized SBA-15 (Pr-SO3H-SBA-15) was prepared as described elsewhere [21]. Molar composition of the synthesis mixture for 4g of templating block-copolymer (Pluronic 123, BASF) was: 0.0369 tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, Aldrich); 0.0041 mercapto-propyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS, Aldrich); 0.0369 H2O2; 0.24 HCl; 6.67 H2O. Likewise, arenesulfonic functionalized SBA-15 (Ar-SO3H-SBA-15) was synthesized following a previously reported procedure [22]. In this case, the molar composition of the synthesis mixture for 4g of pluronic 123 was as follows: 0.0369 TEOS:0.0041 chlorosulfonylphenylethyltrimethoxy-silane (CSPTMS, Gelest):0.24 HCl:6.67 H2O. In both materials, the amounts of sulfur precursors (MPTMS and CSPTMS) have been selected to provide 10% of total silicon moles. Ion-exchange sulfonic resin Amberlyst 70 (Amb-70) was provided by Rohm & Haas and before use, it was washed with methanol to remove absorbed water. Acid zeolites with different structures were supplied by Zeolyst International (H-Beta and H-USY) and by Süd-Chemie (H-ZSM-5). Sulfated zirconia (ZrO2-SO4 2−) was kindly provided by Mel Chemicals. Before their use in catalytic experiments, all the inorganic solids were thermally treated in air at 550°C for 5h under static conditions in order to remove water adsorbed over acid sites."
3,Catalysts characterization,"2.2 Catalysts characterization Textural properties of the tested acid catalysts were calculated from nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms, which were recorded at 77K using a Micromeritics TRISTAR 3000 system. Pores sizes distributions were calculated using the BJH method applying the KJS correction, and total pore volume was taken at P/P 0 =0.975. Acid capacity of sulfonic materials (Pr-SO3H-SBA-15, Ar-SO3H-SBA-15, and Amb-70) was measured by the determination of cationic-exchange capacity using 2M NaCl as the cationic-exchange agent. In a typical experiment, 0.05g of solid was added to 15g of aqueous solution containing the sodium salt. The resulting suspension was titrated potentiometrically by the dropwise addition of 0.01M NaOH(aq). The acid capacity of inorganic materials was determined by means of temperature programmed desorption of NH3 in a Micromeritics 2910 (TPD/TPR) equipment fitted with a TCD detector. Samples were outgassed at 550°C under flowing He for 2h prior to NH3 pulse at 180°C (30min). Thermal programmed desorption under a He flow consisted in increasing the temperature from 150°C to 550°C at 15°Cmin−1. Elemental analysis of zeolites was performed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) with a Varian Vista AX spectrometer to confirm the Si/Al ratios provided by the commercial supplier."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests Catalytic experiments were performed in liquid phase in a stainless-steel stirred autoclave (500mL) fitted with temperature control and a pressure gauge. Typically, 7.6g of furfuryl alcohol were mixed with 3g of catalyst and 300mL of the corresponding alcohol used as reaction media (methanol, ethanol or 2-propanol). Catalytic tests were also carried out using α-angelica lactone, levulinic acid and iso-propyl levulinate as substrates. Decane was added as internal standard for analytical purposes in a concentration of 10gL−1. After closing the reactor, stirring was fixed in 1000rpm and a heating rate of 2.5°Cmin−1 was established. Samples were taken periodically and the solution filtered into a vial. Selected catalysts were tested in the temperature range of 130–170°C."
5,Product analysis,"2.4 Product analysis Reaction samples were analyzed by gas chromatography, using a Varian 3900 gas chromatograph fitted with a ZB-WAX Plus column (30m×0.25mm, DF=0.25μm) and a FID detector. Compounds detected by GC included unreacted furfuryl alcohol and alkyl furfuryl ethers, alkyl levulinates, levulinic acid, α/β-angelica lactones and di-alkyl ethers as main reaction products. The identification of the bio-products was checked by GC–MS using a Bruker 320-MS GC Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer equipped with a capillary column (BR-SWax, 30m×0.25mm×0.25μm), and He as the carrier gas. Product quantification was based on a previous calibration of the analysis unit with standard stock solutions of pure commercially-available chemicals using decane as internal standard. Degradation products named as humins was calculated as the amount of furfuryl alcohol no transformed into detected products. Catalytic results are shown either in terms of absolute conversion of furfuryl alcohol (X FOL) or in terms of yields towards the different products (Y i ). The etherification of the alcohol used as reaction media was evaluated as di-alkyl ether yield (Y DAE). Definitions of these parameters are as follows: X FOL = Reacted mol of furfuryl alcohol Initial mol of furfuryl alcohol × 100 Y i = Formed mol of i Initial mol of furfuryl alcohol × 100 Y DAE = 2 · Formed mol of di-alkyl ether Initial mol of alcohol × 100"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Preliminary catalytic studies: effect of the alcohol solvent and reaction network,"3.1 Preliminary catalytic studies: effect of the alcohol solvent and reaction network In order to establish the reaction mechanism of the transformation of furfuryl alcohol in alcohol media, some preliminary reactions were performed using a commercially available H-beta zeolite (Si/Al=14.5) as catalyst in the presence of different alcohols (methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol) as solvent. Likewise, selected bio-products detected as reaction intermediates (lactones, levulinic acid, ethyl furfuryl ether and isopropyl-levulinate) were also used as initial substrates to elucidate the reaction network. Catalytic results in terms of substrate conversion and yields towards the target compounds are depicted in Table 1 . The conversion of furfuryl alcohol (FOL) in alcohol media leads to a wide range of products consisting of the corresponding alkyl furfuryl ether (FE), the corresponding alkyl levulinate (LEV), levulinic acid (LA) and angelica lactone (LACT) as main compounds. These biomass-derived products were identified by GC–MS (see Figures S1–S3 in Supplementary Information for the mass fragmentation patterns corresponding to 2-propanol). Comparing the results obtained for the three alcohols used as reaction media, though each of them providing a complete conversion of FOL, different products distributions were observed. Thus, for the lower alcohols, methanol and ethanol, moderate alkyl levulinate yields were obtained, together with the production of some FE and LACT, and a low amount of LA. Instead, when using 2-propanol, the yield to LEV was dramatically reduced producing FE and LACT as main products. This different behavior in the presence of 2-propanol can be attributed to diffusional limitations of the furfuryl alcohol-derived intermediates bearing isopropyl moieties in the microporous structure of beta zeolite [23]. This limits the reaction rate of the overall transformation, decreasing the production of the relatively bulky isopropyl levulinate, which can be considered the end of the reaction network under the tested conditions. Increasing the molecular size of the alcohol, the conversion of the corresponding ether into other bulky compounds (such as alkyl levulinates) seems to become much more difficult. However, it must be noted that the use of 2-propanol with FOL as substrate increases significantly the added yield towards target products (ca. 84%) minimizing the formation of undesirable side-products in comparison with methanol and ethanol.

However, it must be noted that the use of 2-propanol with FOL as substrate increases significantly the added yield towards target products (ca. 84%) minimizing the formation of undesirable side-products in comparison with methanol and ethanol. Starting from angelica lactone (LACT), almost 100% of conversion was achieved for the three alcohols, being the products detected essentially LEV and LA. In the case of methanol, the main bio-products were methyl levulinate (41.5%) and LA (16%), whereas an opposite trend was observed for 2-propanol (48.8% of LA and 6.6% of LEV). These results confirm that steric hindrances are taking place in the esterification of LA to LEV with the larger alcohol and H-Beta zeolite as catalyst. In any case, the transformation of LACT into LA and subsequent esterification of LA to LEV is clearly evidenced (see Figure S4 in Supplementary Information). Hence, it can be inferred that, in the overall FOL conversion, the production of LEV is carried out through two different ways, directly from FE or from LA via intermediate formation of LACT.

Hence, it can be inferred that, in the overall FOL conversion, the production of LEV is carried out through two different ways, directly from FE or from LA via intermediate formation of LACT. The use of LA as substrate provided results suggesting that the conversion is strongly dependent on the size of the alcohol, giving the corresponding esterification product, LEV, as only product. Again, lower alcohols led to higher production of LEV, being limited the formation of isopropyl levulinate in zeolite Beta. Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of the structure, pore and channel size over acid sites density in the synthesis of LEV from LA, having been obtained the best activities with materials having a higher mesoporous volume [8]. In the case of the model substrate EFE using 2-propanol as reaction media, LACT is the main product detected, but some LEV is also obtained (see Figure S4 in Supplementary Information). Finally, the conversion of i-LEV with 2-propanol was negligible, which proofs the stability of this bio-product under the studied reaction conditions.

Finally, the conversion of i-LEV with 2-propanol was negligible, which proofs the stability of this bio-product under the studied reaction conditions. Based on these results and literature data, a plausible reaction pathway for the acid-catalyzed transformation of furfuryl alcohol into bio-products in alcohol media is proposed and depicted in Scheme 1 . The production of LEV can be achieved by two competitive sequences of reactions: FOL–FE–LEV and FOL–LACT–LA–LEV. The proposed reaction scheme is consistent with that reported by Antunes et al. [4] The first sequence of reactions involve the etherification of furfuryl alcohol followed by a transformation of the alkyl furfuryl ether into the corresponding alkyl levulinate [23], involving the opening of the furan ring and the addition of a water molecule. The second sequence of reactions starts with the isomerization and rearrangement of furfuryl alcohol to angelica lactone, which is, in turn, attacked by alcohols to form alkyl levulinates [24]. LA can also be produced from LACT [25], or directly formed from FOL throughout different pathways [10], both transformations being significantly favoured by the presence of water. Comparing the different alcohols, the acid-catalyzed ethanolysis of furfuryl alcohol is well-known and described in numerous studies [12,14,16,26]. To the best of our knowledge, further investigations using longer-chain alcohols are scant, and therefore we preferred to use 2-propanol as the reaction media for the rest of the studies included within this work. It must be noted that this alcohol limits the formation of undesired products when starting from FOL (see data in Table 1). Moreover, these preliminary studies carried out on zeolite Beta clearly state that the bio-products distribution is strongly influenced by textural properties and accessibility of the acid sites of the catalysts, especially in the case of microporous materials."
8,Catalysts screening,"3.2 Catalysts screening In order to study the influence of the catalyst nature and structure in the synthesis of bio-products from FOL, a number of heterogeneous acid catalysts has been tested for its conversion in 2-propanol as reaction media. These materials include several commercial zeolites with different structures, sulfonic acid functionalized materials (mesostructured silicas and resins) and sulfated zirconium oxide. Accessibility, strength and amount of acid sites are the main aspects that can affect the catalytic behavior. Table 2 summarizes the most relevant physicochemical properties recorded for the acid catalysts tested in this work. Zeolites are microporous materials with high surface areas and crystalline ordered network channels. Hence, both the size of the reactants and products involved in the reaction and the size of the zeolite channel pore are important aspects to take into account in order to choose the best catalyst for a specific application. In this sense, zeolites with different size and microporous structure, as well as different acid capacity, such as H-Beta, H-ZSM-5 and H-USY, have been tested in furfuryl alcohol transformation in 2-propanol. The results are shown in Fig. 1 . Under the selected reaction conditions, the three zeolites showed a complete substrate conversion within the first 2.5h of reaction (not shown). Therefore, the etherification of furfuryl alcohol seems to be an easy step for all of them. However, for H-ZSM-5, the subsequent transformation into levulinate appears to be hindered due to the small pore size of MFI framework (ca. 5.5Å). Hence, long reaction times are required in order to get i-LEV, since the access of the reactants to the catalytic acid sites located inside the porous system is limited for this catalyst. On the other hand, H-Beta zeolite provides lactones as main product (see Scheme 1), in agreement with the results reported in the literature [4]. This behavior could be attributed to the lower strength of the acid sites of this particular zeolite (see maximum ammonia desorption temperature measured from NH3-TPD in Table 2) that may limit the acid transformation of FE into LEV. In addition, BEA structure, despite having a larger pore than MFI, could still generate some diffusional limitations through this step, being the stages 3 and 10 more favoured than stage 2 (Scheme 1, k 3, k 10 and k 2, respectively). Moreover, the formation of high amounts of levulinic acid using this catalyst could arise from LACT or directly from initial FOL (stages 4 and 8 in Scheme 1, respectively). Finally, USY, the most acidic zeolite – in terms of acid loading and strength and displaying a three-dimensional pore network with interconnected large cavities (ca. 12Å) (Table 2), should minimize the mass transfer limitations observed for the other two zeolites. Thus, a combination of both factors, high acid loading and strength and better diffusion of chemicals, seems to be the reason for the higher levulinate (i-LEV) yield over this catalyst. In conclusion, pore structure and features of acid sites are important factors in the furfuryl alcohol conversion over acid zeolites, having strong influence on the final bio-products distribution. Fig. 2 shows the products yields obtained over sulfated zirconium oxide and sulfonic acid supported catalysts. Zirconia-based catalysts (specifically ZrO2-SO4 2−) are enormously popular due to their strong acidity and excellent thermal stability. However, these solid acids show a very low specific surface area that limits the dispersion of the acid sites. In the present case, as compared to zeolites, sulfated zirconia yielded higher i-LEV yield, in spite of its lower acid capacity. This result can be explained in terms of acid strength. However, after 9h of reaction an important amount of i-FE still remains in the reaction medium (Fig. 2), suggesting that this material is not able to conduct the transformation of i-FE into i-LEV at a high rate. Sulfonic acid-supported materials, characterized by strong Brønsted acidity, have also been tested in the transformation of FOL in 2-propanol. Two different types of materials have been studied: ordered mesoporous silica, SBA-15, functionalized either with propyl or arenesulfonic acid sites (Pr-SO3H-SBA-15 and Ar-SO3H-SBA-15, respectively) and a cation-exchange resin, Amberlyst-70, comprising phenylsulfonic acid sites (Amb-70). The SBA-15 silicas show high specific surface area, narrow pore sizes distributions with high accessibilities to acid sites, and relatively high acid strength [21,22]. On the other hand, the sulfonic acid resin Amberlyst-70 possesses a superior acid capacity, balancing its lack of textural properties (Table 2). As shown in Fig. 2, the three sulfonic acid supported materials showed a remarkably high yield of i-LEV even at short reaction times. This outstanding catalytic behavior is ascribed to the strong acidity provided by SO3H functional groups. Additionally, a lower amount of LACT is observed, especially in comparison with zeolites. Note that sulfonic acid-modified mesostructured materials, both with lower acid sites loadings than Amb-70 but homogeneously distributed on the surface of the silica support, have provided similar yields to those shown by the sulfonic resin. Indeed, arene-sulfonic acid functionalized SBA-15 has shown the best catalytic results in terms of i-LEV production. In the case of Pr-SO3H-SBA-15 catalyst, with similar acid capacity and textural properties to Ar-SO3H-SBA-15, the results obtained are slightly worse, due to the lower acid strength of alkyl- vs. phenyl-SO3H acid sites [22]. Again, this is an indication that higher acid strengths are desirable for the production of levulinates. However, on the other hand, catalysts with high Brønsted acid capacity and strength usually promote also undesired side-reactions, especially for the present application the etherification of the 2-propanol used as reaction media. In order to evaluate this effect, the di-isopropyl ether (DIE) production at the reaction temperature used in the catalysts screening (130°C) after 9h is depicted in Fig. 3 . As expected, the sulfonic acid-supported materials gave higher yields to DIE than sulfated zirconia or acid zeolites. The resin Amb-70, with the highest acid capacity, is the catalyst yielding the highest yield of DIE, followed by the mesostructured materials functionalized with arenesulfonic acid sites and finally the one functionalized with propylsulfonic acid sites, due to the lower acid strength of this kind of acid sites. Sulfated zirconia, with lower acid capacity, scarcely promoted the auto-etherification of 2-propanol under the tested reaction conditions. Finally, the production of DIE among zeolites follow the order: H-Beta>H-USY>H-ZSM-5, although all of them with low yields, reaching values below 2.5% after 9h of reaction. Summarizing, the benchmarking of the different acid solid catalysts has revealed the importance of both the porous structure, which settles the accessibility of chemicals to the active sites, and the amount and strength of the acid sites in the production of alkyl-levulinate and other bio-products starting from furfuryl alcohol."
9,Temperature effect and kinetic modelling,"3.3 Temperature effect and kinetic modelling The effect of the temperature in the products distribution was assessed in the range of 130–170°C for those catalysts that have shown a better catalytic performance in the preliminary screening (Fig. 4 ). Among zeolites, H-Beta has been selected since it provided LACT as main product. Sulfated zirconia and Ar-SO3H-SBA-15 have been chosen as purely Brønsted solid acids. As Fig. 4 shows, H-Beta gives LACT as main product regardless of the temperature. A significant degradation of LACT can be observed at 170°C and long reaction times. An increase in temperature favours the production of i-FE, that is subsequently transformed into i-LEV. In addition, LA yield enhances at higher temperatures, probably by hydration of FOL or degradation of LACT. In the case of sulfated zirconia, the transformation of i-FE into others bio-products is slow at 130°C. Hence, i-LEV production is highly influenced by the temperature, and increasing the reaction temperature to 150°C provided higher yields of i-LEV and LACT within a moderate reaction time (below 4h). On the contrary, sulfonic catalyst Ar-SO3H-SBA-15 showed a good catalytic performance even at the lower temperature (130°C), being this temperature high enough to produce high amount of i-LEV at short reaction times. An increase of the temperature for this catalyst just affected LA formation, which increases slightly. It is also important to consider the effect of temperature on the production of di-isopropyl ether over the different kind of catalysts under study (Fig. 5 ). For all of them, an increase in the temperature leads to an increase in the etherification yield of the 2-propanol used as solvent. It must be pointed out that the extent of this side reaction is specially promoted in the presence of the sulfonic mesostructured material, Ar-SO3H-SBA-15, losing more than 20% of the starting 2-propanol in the form of DIE at 170°C. However, it must be noted that, for this catalyst, the optimal production of levulinate is already achieved at the lowest temperature (130°C), wherein DIE formation is much more limited. Taking a step forward in the study of the influence of the reaction temperature, and taking as a reference the mechanism described in Scheme 1, a pseudo-homogeneous kinetic modelling has been proposed. The reactor was modelled as a perfectly stirred batch reactor, considering first-order reactions for all steps involved as follows: d C FOL d t = − k 1 · C FOL − k 6 · C FOL − k 7 · C FOL − k 10 · C FOL d C FE d t = k 1 · C FOL − k 2 · C FE − k 3 · C FE − k 8 · C FE d C LACT d t = k 3 · C FE − k 4 · C LACT − k 9 · C LACT + k 10 · C FOL d C LEV d t = k 2 · C FE + k 5 · C LA d C LA d t = k 4 · C LACT + k 6 · C FOL − k 5 · C LA d C H d t = k 7 · C FOL + k 8 · C FE + k 9 · C LACT where C is the molar concentration of each component, k i is the apparent reaction kinetic constant of step i at constant temperature. FOL, furfuryl alcohol; FE, isopropyl furfuryl ether; LEV, isopropyl levulinate, LACT, α/β-angelica lactones; LA, levulinic acid; H, humins (degradation compounds coming only from FOL, FE and LACT). Kinetic constants k 11 and k 12 can be considered negligible due to the high stability observed for LEV and LA under the studied reaction conditions. The differential equation system was solved by numerical integration with simultaneous optimization. The non-linear Nelder–Mead method was implemented in a similar way to our previous studies on xylose dehydration [28] by fitting the proposed kinetic model to experimental data (up to 9h) in order to minimize the following objective function: F obj = ∑ m ∑ n = 1 n p [ C m , n , calc − C m , n , exp ] 2 where C m,n,calc and C m,n,exp are the calculated and experimental concentrations of component m (FOL, i-FE, LACT, i-LEV and LA) at reaction time n, respectively. The system was modelled for zeolite H-Beta, the mixed oxide ZrO2-SO4 2− and the arenesulfonic acid supported Ar-SO3H-SBA-15. The kinetic constants calculated for each step involved in the process are shown in Table S1 of the Supplementary data and the predicted concentrations of the different products at each temperature are depicted in Fig. 4. It can be seen that the experimental data (symbols) match relatively well the calculated ones (solid lines), which validates the proposed model. In addition, an Arrhenius plot of ln k i vs. 1/T was applied to get the activation energy (Table S2). The system was modelled for zeolite H-Beta, the mixed oxide ZrO2-SO4 2− and the arenesulfonic acid supported Ar-SO3H-SBA-15. The kinetic constants calculated for each step involved in the process are shown in Table S1 of the Supplementary data and the predicted concentrations of the different products at each temperature are depicted in Fig. 4. It can be seen that the experimental data (symbols) match relatively well the calculated ones (solid lines), which validates the proposed model. In addition, an Arrhenius plot of ln k i vs. 1/T was applied to get the activation energy (Table S2). The analysis of the kinetic parameters calculated for each solid acid catalyst allows to establish a comparison of the catalytic activity of tested materials on each reaction involved in the overall reaction system. Fig. 6 shows the apparent kinetic constants (k i ) at 130°C of the modelled reaction of FOL for steps 1, 2, 3, 6 and 10 (Scheme 1) in the presence of selected catalysts. The etherification of initial FOL to produce i-FE (Reaction 1, Scheme 1), seems to take place quite easily in the case of the mesostructured materials Ar-SO3H-SBA-15 as is deduced from the high kinetic constant values even at 130°C and the low activation energy predicted for this transformation. On the contrary, for sulfated zirconia and H-Beta zeolite this transformation is much slower, since a higher activation energy is required, leading to lower kinetic constants values. Same results were found in the transformation of i-FE into i-LEV (Reaction 2) although with a slow reaction rate for all the tested catalysts. Hence, Brønsted acid sites of arenesulfonic groups in Ar-SO3H-SBA-15 catalyst are the responsible of promoting the first and second steps (Reactions 1 and 2) in a higher extent. On the other hand, i-FE dehydration to LACT (Reaction 3) does not seem to be an easy step for any kind of catalysts, with minor kinetic constants and high activation energy, being the zeolite H-Beta the most energy-favoured catalyst for this transformation (Table S2).

As previously described, LA can be directly produced from FOL (Reaction 6). The best catalytic performance for this transformation was observed for zeolite H-Beta with a significant higher value of kinetic constant as compared to the rest of catalysts. Regarding the direct transformation of FOL into LACT (Reaction 10), the extent of this reaction is negligible for purely Brønsted catalysts, being the easiest step for H-Beta zeolite. These results can be explained in terms of both acid and textural properties of the catalysts; diffusional limitations in zeolite Beta (BEA structure) together with its lower acid capacity and acid strength preferentially promote LACT production from FOL instead of its etherification with the bulky 2-propanol used as reaction solvent. Additionally (not depicted in Fig. 6), reaction 4 is promoted only by H-Beta. The high amount of LACT produced by the zeolite and the presence of water adsorbed over its hydrophilic acid sites are proposed as the main justification for this transformation, observed only at the most demanding reaction conditions. The rest of chemical transformations (Reactions 7–9) are related to the consumption of FOL, i-FE and LACT through side reactions to form degradation products (humins), being the most relevant among them the degradation of furfuryl alcohol when zeolite H-Beta is used as catalyst."
10,Reusability of the catalysts,"3.4 Reusability of the catalysts Catalyst life has also been evaluated for the screened optimal catalysts, Ar-SO3H-SBA-15, H-Beta and ZrO2-SO4 2−. Fig. 7 depicts the results of two consecutive catalytic runs performed at 150°C and 4h of reaction time. Zeolite H-Beta and sulfated zirconia materials were recovered by filtration and regenerated by calcining at 550°C for 5h. Due to its organic nature, sulfonic functionalized SBA-15 silica was instead regenerated by overnight washing with ethanol and HCl under reflux and air-drying, before being used again in a new reaction. From the results shown in Fig. 7, no significant loss of catalytic performance is observed in product yields for zeolite H-Beta since similar results were obtained in both consecutive reactions. In this sense, it is confirmed that the calcination step allows the material to be almost fully regenerated without a significant impact on its performance. On the other hand, for Ar-SO3H-SBA-15 and ZrO2-SO4 2−, slight differences between uses were obtained. It is important to consider the presence of humins and polymeric by-products during the reaction, which are inevitably deposited on the surface of the catalyst during the first run and may affect the catalyst properties. The washing step for Ar-SO3H-SBA-15 does not seem to be enough to recover completely the original activity of the catalyst, although it must be noted that the differences between uses are not very relevant, increasing LACT yield at the expense of i-LEV. The catalytic activity of ZrO2-SO4 2− also suffers a slight decrease in the production of i-LEV and LACT in the second use, even after using a regeneration based on calcination. Some loss of acid capacity might be taking place, caused by several factors such as sulfate groups lixiviation, acid sites neutralization or hindered access to catalytic sites."
11,Conclusions,"Herein we have shown that depending on the alcohol used as reaction media and the physico-chemical properties of the solid acid catalyst, the transformation of furfuryl alcohol can be tuned to provide different bio-products. Thus, according to the experimental and modelled results presented in this work, the conversion of furfuryl alcohol into alkyl levulinate, as main target bio-product, takes place by two competitive cascades of reactions. Regarding the solvent, the size of the alcohol is shown to have a deep influence over the reaction network, especially when using acid zeolites as catalysts, prone to strong diffusional restrictions. The influence of catalyst properties is noticeable when materials with different textural and acid properties are compared using a relatively bulky alcohol like 2-propanol. Zeolites, H-Beta, H-USY and H-ZSM-5, provide lactones and furfuryl ether as main products, with low yield of levulinate, whereas sulfonic acid-supported materials show a remarkable high yield of i-LEV even at short reaction times. Arenesulfonic acid-functionalized SBA-15 has revealed to be the most efficient catalyst for the production of iso-propyl levulinate from furfuryl alcohol in 2-propanol. Additionally, in order to prevent the intermolecular dehydration of 2-propanol to form the corresponding di-ether, an appropriate control of temperature and reaction time is required. In this sense, an outstanding 70% yield of i-LEV can be achieved in less 3h at 130°C over Ar-SO3H-SBA-15 catalysts, with as low as 2.0% of di-isopropyl ether formation. Moreover, the catalytic performance of this catalyst was almost recovered after an acid-solvent washing regeneration step."
