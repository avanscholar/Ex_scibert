0,Introduction,"Hydrogen production by semiconductor mediated photocatalytic water splitting is considered as the best alternative for the sustainable development. Since the discovery of Honda Fujishima effect (Fujishima and Honda, 1972), a large number of semiconductors and their structural modifications have been reported for the H2 production (Ni et al., 2007). Metal oxides (Ni et al., 2007; Pesci et al., 2011; Sivula et al., 2011; Wolcott et al., 2009) and sulfides (Li et al., 2011; Sathish et al., 2006; Xing et al., 2006) have been prompted in different forms and designs to increase the overall quantum efficiency of this reaction. Moreover, the hybrid semiconductor and metal loaded heterostructures such as C3N4-TiO2, Fe2O3-TiO2, Au-TiO2, Pt-TiO2, etc (deKrafft et al., 2012; Pu et al., 2013; Yan and Yang, 2011; Yu et al., 2010) have been designed in order to activate the large bandgap semiconductors under sunlight, and to reduce the rate of electron-hole recombination. Recent years have also witnessed the evolution of metal-free semiconductors like carbon nitride (Sun et al., 2017; Zeng et al., 2017, 2018) for the wider application in photocatalysis due to its cost-effectiveness and low band gap, however the limitation of these materials is the low interfacial charge transport properties. Among all these materials, titanium dioxide (TiO2) is well noted for the photoreduction of the water due to its feasible reduction potential. Numerous efforts have been made to change the morphology, shape, and crystal structure of TiO2 in order to make it viable for the solar water splitting reaction (Hu, 2012; Ni et al., 2007; Park et al., 2006). Recently, the design and fabrication of specific faceted morphologies have been employed for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity, and the mechanism of this is ascribed to the suitable configuration and coordination of surface atoms participating in the reaction (Jiang et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2010). The vastly reported TiO2 possesses several stable facets with variable activity, for example, the (001) facet of anatase phase is considered as more reactive compared to other facets including (101). Typically the anatase polymorph of TiO2 is dominated with thermodynamically stable (101) facet, however, in comparison the surface energy of (101) facet (0.44 J/m2) is very lower over (001) facet (0.90 J/m2) (Diebold, 2003; Sajan et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2014). Due to this reason, the fabrication of TiO2 with a high percentage of (001) facet is highly desirable to increase the rate of uphill photocatalytic reactions including hydrogen production. Owing to its strong thermodynamic, electric and optical viability (Chen and Selloni, 2014; Kudo and Miseki, 2009), TiO2 is one of the promising photoactive material for water splitting. But its photocatalytic activity is known to be limited by its defective crystalline structure leading to fast recombination of charge carriers, and higher band gap (3.2 eV) (Hashimoto et al., 2005; Kumar and Devi, 2011). Therefore, the design of highly energetic and reactive (001) facet has got a vivid attention during recent years to solve these problems (Liu et al., 2011). Earlier reports (Lazzeri et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2010a) have suggested that the surface energy of (001) facet is effective for the dissociative adsorption of reactant molecules. Besides, in comparison to the most stable (101) facet the (001) posses 100% Ti5c surface atoms that are important for effectiveness in charge transport (Jun et al., 2003; Ong et al., 2014). More analysis shows that the water molecules are able to physically absorb on (101) facet but can be chemically dissociated on (001) energetic surface. Based on these facts numerous reports (Pan et al., 2011; Roy et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2012) suggest the higher photocatalytic efficiency of (001) facet. For the visible light sensitization of TiO2 NPs, their loading with noble metal nanostructures have been preferred as well as commonly practiced owing to their surface plasmon resonance characteristic (Boccuzzi et al., 2001; Li et al., 2014). The gold (Au) loading on TiO2 not only makes it visible light active but also imparts the co-catalytic properties to the material. In addition, platinum (Pt) has also been extensively reported for the effective charge separation in water-splitting reaction (Galińska and Walendziewski, 2005). The mechanism of its ability has been previously ascribed to the Schottky junction formation, resulting in the increase of barrier height that directly reduces the electron-hole recombination. Since the Pt doesn't absorb the visible light, hence the co-deposition of Au and Pt on (001) faceted TiO2 can be an effective strategy to enhance the performance of the half reduction of water to produce H2. In this respect, the current study outlines the design and fabrication of TiO2 nanosheets with a larger percentage of (001) facets, and the simultaneous photo-deposition of Au and Pt onto its surface. This co-deposition of Au and Pt is proposed to be effective for water splitting reaction both under direct sunlight and by photoelectrochemical pathways (Melvin et al., 2015). The effect of various parameters including optimization of Pt & Au loading and the role of alcohols as sacrificial reagents onto photocatalytic efficiency is studied, and the photoelectrochemical properties of fabricated photoelectrodes have also been investigated to understand the mechanism. The optimized TNST (Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNST) is found to produce ∼143 μmolh−1 of hydrogen under sunlight irradiation equaling 16.1% apparent quantum efficiency, which is higher than earlier reports (Qi et al., 2011; Yuan et al., 2015)."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals and reagents,"2.1 Chemicals and reagents Titanium butoxide, (Ti (OBu)4, 98%, Sigma Aldrich), hydrogen fluoride (HF, 43%, Aventor performance materials Ltd.), chloroauric acid (HAuCl4, 49%, Sigma Aldrich), platinum chloride (H2PtCl5. XH2O, 48%, Loba Chemie. Ltd.), ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol (98–99%, SD fine chemicals Ltd.) were used as received without any further purification. The de-ionized water obtained from the Millipore ultrafiltration system (conductivity = 40 mho cm−1 at 30 °C) was used throughout the experiment."
3,Fabrication of TNST and photo-deposition of Au/Pt,"2.2 Fabrication of TNST and photo-deposition of Au/Pt TNST's were synthesized using Ti(OBu)4 as TiO2 precursor. In a typical procedure, 20 mL of Ti(OBu)4 and 3.2 mL of HF were mixed directly in a Teflon lined autoclave (80 mL), which was subjected to heating at 200 °C for 24 h. After cooling at room temperature the precipitates of as-synthesized TNST's were separated, and washed under several cycles of centrifugation using distilled water and ethanol. The photo-deposition of Au and Pt (different weight percent ratios) was carried out by modifying the earlier reported method (Chan and Barteau, 2005). Briefly, 100 mg of obtained TNST powder was dispersed in an aqueous mixture containing isopropyl alcohol in equal ratio. The respective amount of HAuCl4 (0.01 mM) and H2PtCl5 (0.01 mM) corresponding to their different weight ratio were added to the TNST dispersion, followed by purging with Ar for 15 min. The sealed reaction tube was irradiated under UV light (125 mW) for 4 h. The formation of Au0 and Pt0 resulted due to the reduction of their ionic counterparts by the photoexcited electrons on the surface of TNST, while the holes were scavenged by the isopropyl alcohol. The photo-deposited TNST powder was separated and washed with DI water and ethanol. Thus obtained photocatalysts were abbreviated as TNST (TiO2 nanosheets), Au-TNST (Au loaded TiO2 nanosheets), Au/Pt-TNST (Au and Pt co-deposited TiO2 nanosheets) and the subscript represents the weight ratio of the metal with respect to TNST."
4,Characterization and photocatalytic activity,"2.3 Characterization and photocatalytic activity The optical absorption properties of the photocatalysts were measured by Analytic Jena, Specord 205 spectrometer (Germany) in the 190–1100 nm wavelength range. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was done by PANalytical Xpert Pro diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα (1.54 A°, operating at 45 kV) in the diffraction angle range of 20°–80° (5°/min). The HR-TEM analysis was carried out on Hitachi electron microscope (7500 model), operating at 50–200 kV. The SEM-EDS analysis was done using JEOL, JSM-7600 F 01 and SU8-180 (FE-SEM) systems. The oxidation state of the elements was recorded by X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (KRATOS Axis 165, Shimadzu) equipped with Mg Kα. The adsorptions-desorption and porosity characteristics of the photocatalysts were studied at cryogenic temperature with Brunner-Emmett-Teller based BET analyzer (BEL mini-II, Micro Trac Corp. Pvt. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). The Raman spectra were recorded using Renishaw 2000 spectrometer (100–800 cm−1) using He–Ne laser (514.5 nm). The photocatalytic activity was performed in a Pyrex reaction tube (20 mL) containing the reaction mixture (water: sacrificial agent, 4:1), and the optimized 0.020 g of the photocatalyst. The reaction mixture was purged with Ar (10 min) to create an inert atmosphere for photoreduction, followed by direct sunlight irradiation (average intensity 430 W m−2) for different time intervals under continuous stirring. The quantification of the gas produced during the reaction was done with gas chromatography (GC, Nucon, India) system equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A molecular sieve (5XA) column was used for separation and the temperature of injector, oven, and detector was programmed at 30 °C each. The quantification of the gas produced during the reaction was done using 180 ppm standard of N2 balanced H2 provided by Sigma gases, New Delhi, India. The apparent quantum efficiency was calculated using following equation. AQE ( % ) = n* Δ G W*S*T * 100 where ‘n’ denotes the moles of H2 produced (moles/L), ‘ΔG’ is total free energy change for water splitting (237 kJ/mol), ‘W’ represents the sun radiation (W/m2), S is the surface area of the reaction tube (m2) and‘t’ is the time of the reaction (sec)."
5,Electrochemical properties,"2.4 Electrochemical properties An interfaced Autolab (Metrohm) electrochemical workstation was used to carry out all electrochemical and photo-electrochemical measurements. Cyclic voltammetric (CV) and impedance behavior of the materials was studied by coating 10 μl of TNST, Au/TNST, Pt/TNST and Au/Pt-TNST (5 mg/mL) onto a glassy carbon working electrode, which was air dried. Platinum (Pt) and Ag/AgCl were used as counter and a reference electrode, whereas 5 mM Ferri/Ferro containing 0.1 M KCl was used as redox electrolyte. Impedance spectra were recorded with frequency response analyzer at open circuit potential in the 0.1 to 105 frequency range under 10 mV ac perturbation signal. The obtained Nyquist plot was analyzed with Zview software to fit into an equivalent circuit. A solar simulator equipped with 300 W Xe lamp and AM 1.5 filter was used as light source and the intensity of the source was calibrated and controlled at 100 mW/cm2. Photo-electrochemical (PEC) experiments were performed using a three electrode configuration, where TNST, Au/TNST, Pt/TNST and Au/Pt-TNST coated ITO was used as a working electrode in isolated experiments. The PEC chamber was air cooled, keeping the electrolyte temperature at 25 °C and purged with nitrogen to remove dissolved oxygen. Linear sweep voltammeter (LSV) measurements were recorded at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in the dark and light experiments in 0.1 M NaOH."
6,Results and discussion,
7,"Morphological, structural and surface properties","3.1 Morphological, structural and surface properties The Fig. 1 (a) associated with HRTEM micrographs of as-synthesized TNST and optimized Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNST manifests a well-defined sheet type morphology of TNST with the average dimensions of 55 nm × 46 nm (length x breadth). The d spacing of 0.34 nm and 0.23 nm measured from the micrographs (Fig. 1(b) and (c)) corresponding to (101) and (001) facets of anatase TiO2, respectively (Chu et al., 2015). The presence of (001) is confirmed by the horizontal plane parallel to x, y and intersecting the z-axis. XRD analysis also confirms the presence of (004) plane, which is a direct evidence for the presence of (001) facet in synthesized TNST. Moreover, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern also confirms the presence of (001) and (101) facets. No change in the morphology of the nanosheets was observed after Au and Pt (Fig. 1(d)) loading, the observed additional lattice spacing of 0.14 nm and 0.12 nm is credited to the Au and Pt, respectively (Fig. 1(e)). The average length x breadth of the as-synthesized nanosheets was calculated to be 55 nm × 46 nm (this calculation was done manually by taking 20 particles in counting and ignoring the interference of fewer larger particles). Fig. S1 (electronic supporting information) represents the XRD patterns of the TNST, Au0.4-TNST, Pt0.75-TNST and Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNST, wherein the diffraction peaks were observed at 25.4°, 37.8°, 48.0°, 55.2° and 62.8°, which are indexed to (101), (004), (200), (105) and (116) planes of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS card No. 73-1764). The increases in the diffraction peak of (101) plane indicate the growth of TiO2 at 200 °C and the broadness of (004) peak suggests the presence of (001) facets as favored by earlier reports (Ding et al., 2015). The absence of (001) peak can be attributed to its structural factor value (= 0), credited to the tetragonal body-centered geometry of TiO2. The sharpness of (101) peak and slight broadness of (004) is due to preferred exposure of respective planes after the removal of F− by washing (Liu et al., 2010b), which is also evident from the EDS studies (Fig. S2), showing no traces of F−. The percentage of (001) facet was calculated by measuring the variation in the peak intensity ratio of A1g (620 cm−1) and Eg (376, 779 cm−1) peaks in Raman spectrum (Fig. S3), and found to be ∼54%, (Chu et al., 2015). It was observed that as the exposure of (001) facets increases the intensity of E g peak reduces gradually, while that of A1g peak and E1g peak increases. Basically E g peak originates due to the stretching vibration of O–Ti–O whereas the B1g peak is because of the symmetric bending vibration of O–Ti–O. Similarly, A1g peak is mainly due to antisymmetric bending vibration of O–Ti–O. As the percentage of exposed (001) facets increases, the less number of stretching vibration modes of O–Ti–O are observed, and consequently the intensity of E g peak decreases. On the other hand, when the exposed (001) facets lower the number of symmetric bending vibrations and the antisymmetric bending vibrations of O– Ti–O increases. The surface area depicted by Brunner-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis (Fig. S4) via N2 adsorption-desorption method at cryogenic temperature revealed that the photocatalysts are mesoporous and multilayered in nature as witnessed by typical IV Langmuir adsorption isotherms (Rather et al., 2017b). Furthermore, in respect to IUPAC nomenclature, the hysteresis loops of TNST, Au0.4-TNST and Pt0.75-TNST correspond to H3 type indicating a non-uniform pore structure of the mesoporous material (Hadnadjev-Kostic et al., 2013), while in case of Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNST the hysteresis loop showed H4 character due to larger pore strain or stacking of the NPs. A small variation in the surface area of the photocatalysts was observed after metal loading, the specific surface area of bare TNST (69.0 m2 g−1) got increased to 81.8 m2 g−1 after the co-deposition of Au and Pt, which could be assigned to the surface deposition of Au/Pt, and also little pore strain was observed in BJH analysis. The BJH study (Fig. S5 and Table S1) showed a little pore strain in Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNST (10.65 nm) in comparison to TNST (12.24 nm) credited to the incorporation of small metallic NPs into the pores of TNST, the pore strain and surface metal distribution contributes to the increase in specific surface area."
8,XPS and optical characteristics,"3.2 XPS and optical characteristics The XPS analysis of the Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNST was done to explore the surface composition and oxidation state of the respective elements, as presented in Fig. S6 the XPS survey scan shows the presence of Ti, O, Pt and Au elemental peaks. Moreover, the deconvoluted spectra (Fig. 2 ) revealed the typical binding energy values at 459.0 eV and 464.4 eV for Ti 2p assigned to Ti+4 oxidation state with the spin quantum state of 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively (Rather et al., 2017b). A small peak observed at 457.8 eV can be ascribed to presence of Ti+3 species in the same mixture formed by the larger UV exposure during the photo-deposition of Au and Pt. The deconvoluted spectra of O1s also shows two typical peaks at 530.3 eV and 531.3 eV credited to the interaction of oxygen with TiO2 and H2O, respectively (Rather et al., 2017a). The photoreduction of Au+3 to Au0 was witnessed by two separate peaks observed at 83.0 eV and 87.5 eV respectively, assigned to 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 spin states of Au0 (Kruse and Chenakin, 2011). Similarly in case of Pt, two smoothly fitted peaks at 70.5 eV and 73.9 eV are due to the presence of metallic Pt0 formed after photoreduction of Pt+3 (Lee and Choi, 2005). The optical absorption spectra of different photocatalysts are presented in Fig. S7(a), it was observed that after metal loading (Pt and Au separately and co-deposition) a strong absorption maxima was observed around 577 nm due to the coherent oscillation of surface electrons with the matching incoming frequency or surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect along with that of typical absorption edge of TNST (377–396 nm) (Baffou and Quidant, 2014), while as no such property is revealed by Pt. Moreover, the increase in the amount of Au the intensity of SPR band also increased (Fig. S7(b)), the slight shift observed after increasing the amount of Au could be due to the varying particle size."
9,Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical (PEC) studies,"3.3 Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical (PEC) studies Fig. 3 (a–c) are associated with cyclic voltammetry (CV) characteristic of TNST, Au0.4/TNST, Pt0.75/TNST and Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNST modified glassy carbon electrodes in Fe (CN)6 3−/4− redox system. Owing to the dependence of voltammetric characteristic of Fe (CN)6 3−/4− redox probe on electrode/electrolyte surface interface, it is used to characterize the fabricated modified electrodes. The changes in the peak current and separation of peaks of electrodes can be related to the electron transfer rate constant of the modified electrodes. It can be observed from Fig. 3(a), the anodic and cathodic peak current density associated with redox process of Fe2+/Fe3+ species, the peak current Ipa and Ipc, increases with the loading of Au and Pt onto TNST (inset Fig. 3(a), wherein the Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNST modified electrodes showed 8% enhanced current characteristic than TNST electrodes (inset Fig. 3(a)). This could be assigned to a conductive characteristic of Au NPs as well as catalytic properties of Pt loaded onto TiO2 nanosheets. Further, the ratio of peak current, i a /i c is calculated to be ∼1 for Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNST electrode surface indicating a nearly reversible oxidation/reduction process of the Fe2+/Fe3+ species. The capacitance, faradic current and formal potential were found to be 3.73 mF, 3.73 × 10−5, 0.26 V, respectively. The number of electrons involved in an electrochemical reaction for a redox-mediated is calculated via ΔE = 0.059/n, where ΔE is the peak to peak separation and is found 0.53. The diffusion coefficient for the charge carriers was calculated to be 1.44 × 10−12 cm2/s using Randles–Sevcik equation for Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNST modified electrodes (Das et al., 2011). The effect of scan rate on the electrochemical characteristic of the Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNST modified electrode was studied by recording CV as a function of scan rate (10–100 mV/s), shown in Fig. 3(b). It is observed that redox peak current (Ipc & Ipa) increases linearly with the square root of scan rate (ν1/2) for the Fe2+/Fe3+ system (Fig. 3(c)) indicating a diffusion controlled process (Ali et al., 2014; Bard and Faulkner, 2001). The slopes and intercepts can be estimated using Equation (1) for anodic peak current: (1) i p a = 9.36 × 10 − 6 × ν 1 / 2 + 1.3 × 10 − 5 The current coefficient ( i p a / v 1 / 2 ) , an indicator for reversible electron transfer is found constant at different scan rate ( 10.5 × 10 − 6 AmV − 1 / 2 sec 1 / 2 ) for Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNST modified electrode, which clearly reveals that electron transfer at these electrodes is fast enough which is a characteristic of reversible reaction system (Mukherjee et al., 2015). Likewise, impedance analysis of all the fabricated electrode in the studied frequency range also supported the CV results. In impedance analysis, Nyquist plot presents the imaginary part of the impedance as a function of its real part. Further, the value of the charge transfer resistance (RP) depends on the dielectric and insulating features at the electrode/electrolyte interface. It is found from Fig. 3(d) and (e) that RP value obtained for TNST modified electrodes equivalent circuit is 737 Ω, which is reduced to 536 Ω, 467 Ω and 338 Ω for Au0.4/TNST, Pt0.75/TNST and Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNST modified electrodes, respectively, which could be again understood in terms of excellent electron transfer channelization due to presence of conductive Au and catalytic Pt in TNST sheets. The electrochemical characterization therefore revealed the potential of Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNST material as an excellent electroactive and charge carrier, which is a required characteristics for a photocatalytic and photo-electrochemical activity. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of fabricated photoanodes was first investigated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) under dark and white light illumination conditions at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and is shown in Fig. 4 . In the dark, the current is negligible in the potential range from −0.6–0.65 V. Under illumination the current increases to 2 mA at 0.5 V and reaches 4.5 mA at 0.65 V for Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNST photoelectrodes, which otherwise is 1.24 mA, 0.56 mA and 0.15 mA for Pt/TNST, Au/TNST and TNST photoelectrodes, respectively. The photocurrent for Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNST is 30 fold higher than TNST alone and could be catalyzed by the presence of Au and Pt as observed form the photocurrent associated with them and electrochemical characterizations discussed earlier. The onset potential for photoanode Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNST is observed to be −0.35 V. The photocurrent versus time (I–T) properties for an externally applied bias of 0.5 V versus the Pt counter electrode for both photoanodes with 50 s light on/off cycles are shown in Fig. 4(b). Under dark condition, the fabricated photoelectrode (PEs) show a negligible current response, while upon illumination, the photocurrent increases rapidly and reaches steady state values. It can be concluded very clearly that Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNST PEs exhibit very good photo-activity performance over other PEs."
10,Photocatalytic activity for the hydrogen production under direct sunlight,"3.4 Photocatalytic activity for the hydrogen production under direct sunlight Several controlled experiments were carried in order to optimize the reaction parameters before studying the overall photocatalytic activity for water splitting. Dark experiments and photochemical studies (without catalyst) were carried out showing no response to the H2 evolution. Furthermore, before the fabrication of Au/Pt-TNST, the amounts of Au and Pt for loading were optimized using ethanol as a hole scavenger. As shown in Fig. S8(a), with the increase in Au content from 0.1 wt% to 0.4 wt%, the rate of H2 evolution increases, and it was observed that Au0.4-TNST produced ∼185 μmol of gas after 8 h sunlight irradiation. Therefore, this amount was fixed as the optimum followed by loading of different weight ratios of Pt. The increase in Pt content from 0.25 to 0.75 wt% resulted in the higher H2 evolution rate, and when the amount of Pt was further increased to 1 wt%, a decrease was observed in overall hydrogen production is observed that is probably due to the overcrowding of active sites, which leads to recombination of charge carriers. From this study, it has been concluded that the optimized amount of Au and Pt is 0.4 wt% and 0.75 wt%, respectively (Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNST), and this ratio has been used for the study of overall hydrogen production activity. The expected ratio was further confirmed by the EDS analysis (Fig. S2) confirming the 0.68 wt% and 0.47 wt% for Pt and Au, respectively, the little variation from the theoretical ratio could be due to the selective portion analysis of the EDS grid. Fig. S9 presents the role and effect of different alcohols as sacrificial agents for the half reduction of water splitting reaction. Here it has been observed that with increase in the hydrocarbon chain length of the hole scavenger, the rate of H2 evolution decreases. The highest amount of H2 (∼1150 μmol) was observed to evolve in case of C2H5OH:H2O mixture (1:4) followed by prop-1-ol (∼550 μmol), prop-2-ol (∼325 μmol) and methanol (∼212 μmol). The comparatively lesser amount was observed in larger hydrocarbon chain alcohols like butanol, pentanol, and hexanol. The reason for the variation in photocatalytic activity is credited to the polarity and miscibility of the alcohols with water (Dosado et al., 2015). The overall photocatalytic activity for the H2 evolution of all photocatalysts is presented in Fig. 5 (a), taking into account the above discussed optimized conditions it was observed that under direct sunlight irradiation small amount of H2 was observed to evolve in case of bare TNST due to its nonviable band potential and non-activation under direct sunlight. After the monometallic loading with Au and Pt, there was an abrupt increase in H2 evolution, ∼950 μmol of gas was detected in Pt0.75-TNST followed by ∼200 μmol by Au0.40-TNST. The H2 production rate of the Au0.40/Pt0.75-TNST photocatalyst was also compared with the commercial available TiO2 (P25) loaded with the same amount of Au and Pt, it was observed that Au0.4-Pt0.75-P25 produced ∼ 540 μmol of gas after 8 h irradiation (Fig. 5(a), and comparatively the rate of H2 production of Au0.40/Pt0.75-TNST was approximately two times higher than Au0.4-Pt0.75-P25. The Au0.40/Pt0.75-TNST produced ∼1150 μmol of gas showing its better performance compared to monometallic and commercial counterparts. Moreover, the time course study (Fig. 5(b)) depicted an exponential increase in the hydrogen production activity up to 8 h. The kinetic study showed an average of ∼143 μmol of H2 produced per hour (μmolh−1). As shown in Fig. S10, and based on the above results the highest apparent quantum efficiency (AQE, %) was reported for Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNST (16.1%) followed by Pt0.75-TNST (13.3%) and Au0.4-TNST (2.8%). Compared to the monometallic (Au and Pt) loaded TNST the AQE of co-deposited samples were recorded higher. Earlier Qi et al. (2011) achieved the AQE of 13.9% using Pt loaded TiO2 nanosheets. In an another work (Yuan et al., 2015), when the metallic nanoparticles were replaced by MoS2 the efficiency further got decreased to 6.4%. Furthermore, the rate of H2 evolution with respect to the surface area was also calculated, and the highest amount of H2 (m−1) evolution was found for Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNST (Fig. S11). The stability of the photocatalyst has been carried up to three consecutive cycles with minimum loss in overall activity (Fig. S12). Based on the characterization and obtained results the plausible mechanism for the H2 evolution from water is shown in Scheme 1 . The H2 evolution on the co-deposited-(001) faceted TiO2 was witnessed to be effective due to its high surface energy value (0.90 J/m2). Due to the sunlight irradiation the Au NP's are activated because of their strong plasmonic absorption property and simultaneously electrons in the valance band of TNST are excited to the conduction band (CB) leaving behind the positively charged holes. This is followed by the charge separation due to the formation of a Schottky barrier between Au and TNST, where these excited electrons are transported towards Pt, which acts as a storage unit for the reduction of water molecules. The Schottky barrier height of Au/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 interface is reported to be 1.3 eV and 1.9 eV, respectively (Shiraishi et al., 2012; Tsukamoto et al., 2012). Therefore, in the co-deposited Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNST, the charge transfer and separation enhances due to the Fermi level equilibrium of Au, Pt and TNST electronic states (Melvin et al., 2015). The holes produced during the photoexcitation are quenched by the sacrificial reagents (alcohols), and itself gets oxidized to respective carbonyl or carboxyl species (Kudo, 2006) that indirectly supports the overall H2 production. We have previously also reported (Rather et al., 2017b) the indirect role of sacrificial reagent for H2 evolution via formation of some oxidized intermediates like formic acid when MeOH was used. As a result, the combination of Au/Pt co-deposited-TiO2 exposed with a high percentage of (001) facet showed brilliant performance for the H2 production from water."
11,Conclusion,"TiO2 nanosheets exposed with a large percentage of energetic (001) facet were synthesized successfully followed by the co-deposition of Au and Pt metallic nanoparticles. The nanostructures were rationally designed for the water-splitting reaction, and the optimized Au0.4/Pt0.75-TNST nanostructure exhibited brilliant optoelectronic and electrochemical properties, leading to a strong response to the uphill water reduction reaction. The Au helped in TiO2 activation, not as a sensitizer but also acting as a co-catalyst, similarly, Pt helped in the formation of effective reduction sites for the transportation, separation and storing of the excited electrons. The co-deposited nanocomposite showed 30 folds photocurrent compared to bare nanosheets."
