0,Introduction,"Modern society is facing great challenges in terms of the global warming and energy crisis because of the growing consumption of fossil fuels, thus the advancement of sustainable energy resources future is an urgent priority [1–3]. Hydrogen, as a potential sustainable and zero-carbon energy source alternative to fossil fuels, has many merits including high power conversion efficiency and CO2-free emission [4,5]. The current hydrogen production approaches mainly include steam reforming of hydrocarbons, water electrolysis and photo-assisted water splitting [6]. Among these approaches, water electrolysis is considered as a promising renewable hydrogen production method because water as reactive material is an easily available and low-cost renewable resource [7]. Moreover, source of electric energy for water electrolysis is green and abundant, such as solar energy and tidal energy. Different water electrolysis systems have been developed, including alkaline liquid water electrolysis (AWE) [8,9], proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) [10], solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) [11] and water photo-electrolysis [12]. Among these water electrolysis systems, AWE is considered to be maturely developed and appropriate for hydrogen production due to its merit of simplicity and operability, and is often preferred for commercial projects [13]. Nevertheless, there are some challenges for AWE still remain to be overcome, including low current density in electrolysis process and high cost for hydrogen production [14]. Thus the enormous efforts are required to develop cost-effective water electrolysis techniques. Recently, a novel acid-alkaline amphoteric water electrolysis has been put forward to cut down the electrical energy consumption for the hydrogen production based on the knowledge that both thermodynamics and kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be tremendously affected by pH of water electrolysis systems [7,15–17]. This process consists of two electrolyte-containing chambers: a cathode chamber for HER, and an anode chamber for OER. The chambers are separated by a membrane that provides a steady-state pH gradients while maintaining separation of the gases products [18–20]. PEMWE as a high-performance electrolysis technology runs in strongly acidic electrolyte. The extremely corrosive acid medium limits the choice of electrocatalysts, and causes the high cost of finding compatible electrocatalysts for HER and OER in one electrolyte [21]. For example, the precious metals (IrO2 and Pt) typically are utilized as the high-performance electrocatalysts for water oxidation in an acidic environment, which impedes PEMWE commercialization at large scale due to the high cost of the noble metals. However, the cost-effective and high-performance acid-alkaline amphoteric electrolysis system only requires a theoretic initial voltage of 0.401 V to launch water electrolysis, which can be attributed to the facts: (1) the most of HER electrocatalysts exhibit the best performance in acidic electrolyte, while the majority of electrocatalysts for OER possess the highest activity in alkaline medium; (2) the electrochemical neutralization energy can facilitate the decrease of the required voltage in acid-alkaline amphoteric water electrolysis (Fig. S1) [16]. Membranes, playing a significant role in amphoteric water electrolysis, to a large extent impact the electrochemical performance and stability of water electrolysis. To integrate acid and base electrolytes into one single electrolyzer, a bipolar membrane (BPM) can be implemented for acid-alkaline separation and ions conduction [22]. However, the bipolar membranes utilized in amphoteric electrolysis possess high ohmic losses due to the two layered structure of a PEM joined to an anion exchange membrane (AEM), resulting in the low electrolytic efficiency [23]. Recently, our group systematically studied the water electrolysis mechanism through Nafion membranes under acid-alkaline amphoteric electrolyte condition [7]. The external voltage of electrolyzer provided an electric field force in the amphoteric water electrolysis with acid and alkaline solutions, which breaked the water splitting counterpoise at the Nafion membrane surface, promoting the movement of H− and OH− along the opposite direction of the electrolyte gradient. Due to the interruption of water splitting counterpoise at the Nafion membrane surface during water electrolysis, the consumption of H− and OH− was recouped successively by the electrolyte chambers for the HER and OER. Thus this mechanism allowed for the amphoteric electrolysis to maintain the concentration of H2SO4 and KOH solutions constant. Although the commercial Nafion membranes produced by DuPont possess high proton conductivity and great durability, especially strong acid and alkaline resistance, the drawbacks of severe electrolytes crossover and high cost hinder their broad applications in acid-alkaline amphoteric water electrolysis. As being promising candidates, polybenzimidazole-based (PBI-based) membranes have been widely investigated for fuel cells, water electrolysis and flow batteries due to their excellent chemical stability, high mechanical strength and outstanding thermal stability [24,25]. When doped with acid/alkaline, PBI-based membranes can be used as cations or anions conduction solid electrolytes, for imidazole structure on polymer backbone can play a role as either Lewis acid or base in different medium [26]. Recently, Li et al. utilized m-PBI as polymer membranes for zero-gap AWE. The m-PBI membrane outperformed the commercially available diaphragm and reached a current density of 1500 mA cm−2 at 2.4 V in 20 wt% KOH at 80 °C [27]. Diaz et al. developed KOH-doped polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-PBI blend membranes for AWE. The PVA-PBI membrane exhibited a current density of 300 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of 2.0 V, which was significantly higher than that of the porous Zirfon® diaphragm (140 mA cm−2 at 2.0 V) [28]. However, the electrolysis performance still needs further improvement for practical applications, and less study concerning the PBI-based membranes for acid-alkaline amphoteric water electrolysis has been reported so far. Herein, we propose the use of PBI-based membranes for acid-alkaline amphoteric water electrolysis. m-PBI and OPBI membranes are prepared by the solution casting method. Then the H2SO4 absorbing capability of m-PBI and OPBI membranes is investigated by doped various concentration of H2SO4 solution. Especially, a structure-property relationship between macromolecules configuration and membrane performance is obtained by comparing m-PBI membrane with OPBI membrane in terms of various physical and electrochemical properties, including membrane swelling, water uptake, mechanical properties and electrolysis performance. Furthermore, long-term stability tests are conducted with cell operation to evaluate membrane durability in acid-alkaline amphoteric water electrolysis."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals and materials,"2.1 Chemicals and materials 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB, 98%), isophthalic acid (IPA, 99%), polyphosphoric acid (PPA), triphenyl phosphate (98%), 4-4’-oxybisbenzoic acid (OBBA) and phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) were purchased from Aldrich. N, N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), potassium hydroxide (KOH), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and H2SO4 were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Beijing Co., Ltd. All chemicals were used without further treatments. Nafion 115 membranes were purchased from DuPont Co."
3,Polymers synthesis and membranes preparation,"2.2 Polymers synthesis and membranes preparation m-PBI and OPBI was synthesized following previously reports [29,30], as shown in Scheme 1 . For the synthesis of m-PBI, in order to remove the water from PPA, PPA (153 g) was heated to 150 °C and maintained 30 min in a three-necked flask (250 mL), which equipped with a mechanical stirring and nitrogen atmosphere (200 mL/min). DAB (3.2427 g) was added into the three-necked flask, and mechanical stirred at 150 °C for 3 h. Then the temperature was heated up to 200 °C, following triphenyl phosphate (0.065 g) and P2O5 (4.5 g) were poured into the three-necked flask in sequence and reacted for 24 h. After polymerization reaction, the obtained polymers were poured into the ultrapure water and boiled the obtained polymer in the NaHCO3 solution to separate m-PBI polymers. Further, the solution was boiled in the ultrapure water to remove impurities. The products were dried for 24 h. For the synthesis of OPBI, MSA (34.0 g) and P2O5 (3.4 g) was added into a three-necked flask (250 mL) equipped with a mechanical stirring at room temperature and stirred until P2O5 was completely dissolved. Under the nitrogen atmosphere, DAB (1.2 g) was added into the previous mixture, the temperature was heated to 140 °C and maintained for 1 h. Then OBBA (1.1 g) was added into three-necked flask and reacted at 140 °C for 1 h to obtain the crude product of polymerization reaction. The other processes of OPBI were identical to that of m-PBI. The PBI-based membranes casting solutions were prepared by dissolving OPBI or m-PBI (400 mg) in DMAc (39.6 g) by vigorous stirring at 80 °C. The polymer solutions were cooled to 20 °C and then cast on a glass plate, which was dried in the oven at 60 °C for 36 h. After the solvent evaporated, the obtained membranes were peeled off from the glass plate. To ensure the entire protonation of the imidazole rings in PBI, the PBI-based membranes were soaked in 3 M H2SO4 aqueous solution for 48 h."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The 1H NMR (Bruker Avance Ⅲ 400 HD) and FT-IR (PerkinElmer Spectrum 100) spectroscopy were utilized to characterize the chemical structure of PBI polymers and membranes, respectively. 1H NMR spectroscopy was carried out by utilizing D6-DMSO as solvent. FT-IR spectroscopy was carried out with the range of 600–4000 cm−1. The composition of H2SO4 doped PBI membranes were determined by equilibrating PBI membranes in aqueous H2SO4 with concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 M overnight at 60 °C. As shown in Eqs. (1)–(3), the weight fractions of PBI (W m-PBI and W OPBI), water (W water) and H2SO4 doping content (X H2SO4) can be calculated, respectively, in which m is the weight of the sampled membrane after entirely wiping with tissue paper, m dry is the weight of the PBI membranes after drying at 100 °C for 3 h and m dedoped is the weight of the PBI membranes after washing the PBI membranes by the ultrapure water several times. (1) X PBI = m dedoped/m (2) X water = (m - m dry)/m (3) X H2SO4 = (m dry – m dedoped)/m The area and volume swellings of PBI membranes were determined by measuring the area and volume changes of PBI membranes after immersing the H2SO4 solution overnight. A home-made conductivity cell was utilized to evaluate the proton conductivity of PBI membranes at 25 °C. The conductivity cell was composed of two separate polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) blocks. Two Pt electrodes were fixed in each PTFE block with 2.0 mm. The assembled conductivity cell had a small size of 0.9 cm. The cell was immersed into the ultrapure water to test the proton conductivity. The area resistance of PBI membranes was recorded at 25 °C by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) utilizing an electrochemical workstation (VersaSTAT 3, Princeton) in the frequency range of 1 Hz-1 MHz. The H+ conductivity of membranes was calculated by the following Eq. (4), in which δ is the thickness of the PBI membranes, R is the area resistance tested by EIS and A is the effective area of the cell. (4) σ = δ/RA The ion permeability of PBI-based membranes was tested by a diffusion cell. A membrane with an effective area of 4 cm−2 was placed between two chambers, the left chamber filled with 3 M H2SO4 solution (50 mL) and the right chamber filled with 6 M KOH solution (50 mL). Both chambers were continually stirred to prevent concentration polarization. The H2SO4 concentration of the left chamber were determined by titrating the samples taken from the left chamber. The acid/alkaline durability of the PBI membranes was assessed by the immersion experiments in the 6.0 M KOH and 3.0 M H2SO4 aqueous solution at 20 °C, respectively."
5,Electrolysis tests,"2.4 Electrolysis tests The water electrolysis tests were conducted by a home-made electrolyzer. The electrolyzer was consisted of two chambers (50 mL), and separated by PBI-based or Nafion membranes of 4 cm2 to hamper the neutralization of H2SO4 and KOH solution. The H2SO4 and KOH electrolytes of different concentration were filled into the cathode and anode chambers, respectively. The Pt net electrode (1 cm2) and the titanium electrode coated ruthenium (1 cm2) were utilized as HER electrode and OER electrode, respectively. The polarization curves were recorded by applying a potential that ranged from 0 to 2.2 V at different temperature of 20 °C, 40 °C and 60 °C. The temperature of water electrolysis was controlled by a thermostatic water bath during the electrolysis process. In the long-term stability tests, a current density of 100 mA cm−2 was fixed to launch electrolysis for 40 h at room temperature."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Chemical structural of PBI,"3.1 Chemical structural of PBI The PBI-based polymers were synthesized by a modified solution condensation reaction, which had been widely studied and reported, as illustrated in Scheme 1, [31,32]. The digital photographs of OPBI and m-PBI membranes are shown in Fig. 1 . Both membranes are yellow, but the color of m-PBI membrane is deeper compared to that of OPBI membrane. The PBI-based membranes exhibited an optically homogeneous nature for their lucid appearance. The molecule structure of the as-prepared PBI was characterized by utilizing 1H NMR and FT-IR. The 1H NMR spectrums of OPBI and m-PBI are shown in Fig. 2 . The signals of m-PBI polymer have been assigned (13.28 (gH), 9.15 (cH), 8.73, 8.33 (dH), 7.95 (eH), 7.80 (fH), 7.64 (aH, bH)) [33]. OPBI gives 1H NMR chemical shifts of 13.07 (f’H), 8.28 (b’H), 7.95, 7.74, 7.52 (c’H, d’H, e’H)and 7.30 (a’H) [34]. These results are consistent with the reported literatures [35–37]. Fig. 3 exhibits the FT-IR spectras of the as-fabricated m-PBI and OPBI membranes. The extremely absorption band, centred between 2400 cm−1 and 3400 cm−1 is ascribed to the stretching vibration of N–H. The characteristic peak at 1629 cm−1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of CN [38]. The peaks located at 1421 cm−1 and 1279 cm−1 are related to in-plane deformation and the stretching vibration of the imidazole rings [39]. These FT-IR results further suggest the successful formation of imidazole rings. Comparing with m-PBI membrane, the absorption bands at 1165 cm−1 can be clearly observed in the FT-IR spectrum of OPBI membrane, corresponding to Ar-O-Ar as a feature structure in OPBI backbone [40]. In short, both FT-IR and 1H NMR show that m-PBI and OPBI membranes are successfully synthesized by a simple polycondensation approach."
8,H2SO4 doping and membrane composition,"3.2 H2SO4 doping and membrane composition PBI has the ability of accommodating strong acid such as H2SO4 or H3PO4 by forming hydrogen bonds between H2SO4 and –N═ in imidazole rings, thus possessing high proton conductivity (Fig. S2). When the PBI membranes are immersed into H2SO4 aqueous solution, the imidazole rings structures are firstly protonated by H2SO4, which is named as bound acid; consequently, the number of imidazole ring determines the doping content of bound acids. In addition, the excess H2SO4 are considered as free acids in the PBI polymers via the binds of hydrogen bonds. It is demonstrated that the predominant mechanism of proton conduction for H2SO4-doped PBI-based membranes belongs to water-assisted proton conduction, which is dependent on water uptake of the membranes [41]. The membrane composition can be determined after immersed in H2SO4 solutions of different concentrations for 2 days at 60 °C. As shown in Fig. 4 a, when immersed in H2SO4 solution of different concentration (0.5–3 M), the H2SO4 absorbent content of m-PBI and OPBI membranes increased with the increase of H2SO4 concentration. For example, the acid doping content of m-PBI membrane increased from 5.9% to 25.8%, when the H2SO4 concentration increased from 0.5 M to 3.0 M. It was worth noting that the acid doping content of m-PBI membrane was significantly higher than that of OPBI membrane, especially in 3 M H2SO4 solution, which can be attributed to the more imidazole rings in the backbone of m-PBI structure. The water uptake of m-PBI and OPBI membranes was irregular with the increase of H2SO4 concentration, as presented in Fig. 4b. The same phenomenon is also reported by Zhao et al. [42] and Kwon et al. [43] The water uptake from the H3PO4 solution maintained the constant when PBI membranes were immersed in phosphoric acid solutions of different concentrations (<9 M). In generally, the water uptake of OPBI membrane was slightly higher than that of m-PBI membrane due to the existence of aryl ether bond, which improve the hydrophilicity of OPBI membrane, which can explain the results that the water uptake of OPBI and m-PBI membranes was 11.2 wt% and 6.5 wt%, respectively when immersed into 3 M H2SO4 solution. Results of acid doping content and water uptake, demonstrating that the H2SO4 absorbent content of PBI-based membranes depend on both the chemical structure of polymer and H2SO4 concentration, while the water uptake of PBI membranes is primarily influenced by the macromolecular structure of PBI polymers (see Table 1 ). The swelling ratios of PBI membranes were determined by measuring the change of area and volume, as exhibited in Fig. 4c–d. The m-PBI and OPBI membranes showed gradually increasing area and volume swelling when the H2SO4 concentration was increased from 0 to 3.0 M. For m-PBI membrane, the volume swelling after equilibration in pure water and 3.0 M H2SO4 was about 2.0% and 12.3%, respectively, which was significantly lower compared to that (12.0% and 19.0%, respectively) of OPBI membrane."
9,"Chemical stability, mechanical properties and thermal stability","3.3 Chemical stability, mechanical properties and thermal stability The chemical stability of PBI membranes was assessed by immersing the m-PBI and OPBI membranes into 6 M KOH or 3 M H2SO4 solution at room temperature, respectively. Both PBI membranes exhibited great integrity after the treatment in alkaline or acid medium for one month, which suggested an excellent chemical stability of PBI membranes, ensuring the application in alkaline-acid amphoteric water electrolysis. The mechanical properties of membranes are essential fundamentals for the long-term operation of acid-alkaline water electrolysis due to the damage of membrane during cell assembling and practical operation. The mechanical properties of the H2SO4-doped PBI membranes was evaluated by recording stress-strain curves. As shown in Fig. 5 a, it was demonstrated that OPBI membrane was the most stretchable membrane among tested membranes, exhibiting elongation at break values of up to 50%. The highest tensile strength (130 MPa) was obtained for the m-PBI membrane, indicating that the backbone structure of m-PBI may produce a more rigid membrane compared to OPBI. Owing to the plasticization effect of water molecules, the membranes with the higher water uptake result in the increase of the elongation and thus decrease of the strength. Therefore, the test results of mechanical property are in accord with the water uptake of PBI membranes. Based on these experimental results, m-PBI and OPBI membranes could provide satisfactory mechanical requirements for the stable operation in acid-alkaline amphoteric water electrolysis. TGA curves of m-PBI and OPBI membranes were presented in Fig. 5b. Approximately 6% weight loss was typically observed for m-PBI and OPBI membranes at temperatures of up to 100 °C, which was the result of the volatilization of absorbed water. In the range of 200 °C-600 °C, the weight loss was approximately 10% for m-PBI and OPBI membranes, which was related to loss of the residual solvent. When the temperature was above 600 °C, the polymer backbone of membranes started to degrade. The low mass degradation manifested the excellent thermal stability of PBI membranes."
10,Proton conductivity and ion permeability,"3.4 Proton conductivity and ion permeability To date, much research on the ionic conductivity of the H2SO4-doped PBI or H3PO4-doped PBI membranes has been reported, for demonstrating their potential application in field of high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells and vanadium redox flow batteries [44,45]. However, these application scenarios call for a different H2SO4 concentration range from electrolytes in amphoteric water electrolysis. Therefore, the impact of H2SO4 concentration on the proton conductivity of PBI membranes must be systematically studied to assess the promising application of the PBI-based membranes in acid-alkaline amphoteric water electrolysis. To make sure that the PBI membranes fully absorb H2SO4, the prepared PBI membranes were immersed in H2SO4 solution of different concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 M) for 48 h. Moreover, the Nafion 115 were also treated under same processes for comparison. Fig. 6 compares the proton conductivity of m-PBI, OPBI and Nafion 115 membranes. The proton conductivity of Nafion 115 was high (~80 mS cm−1) because of the nanophase separation between extremely hydrophobic backbones and hydrophilic side chains [46]. Nonetheless, the proton conductivity of Nafion 115 had a negligible change in different concentrations of H2SO4 solution. For PBI-based membranes, the proton conductivity of the m-PBI and OPBI membranes increased continuously and rapidly with the increase of H2SO4 concentration. The measured proton conductivity of m-PBI membrane is 7.0 mS cm−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4, which reached nearly one tenth of the proton conductivity of Nafion 115. However, when H2SO4 concentration reached as high as 3.0 M, the proton conductivity of the m-PBI membrane increased by 40 mS cm−1. Moreover, the conductivity of m-PBI membrane was significantly higher than that of OPBI membrane, especially in the 3.0 M H2SO4. The higher proton conductivity of m-PBI membrane can be attributed to the unique protons transportation mechanism of PBI-based membranes by increasing H2SO4 doping content at higher H2SO4 concentrations (Fig. 4a). The transmembrane permeability rate of proton and hydroxide ion has significant impact on the extend durability performance of acid-alkaline water amphoteric water electrolysis. The transmembrane permeability tests were conducted under the amphoteric solutions (3.0 M H2SO4//6.0 M KOH). As shown in Fig. 7 a–b, the concentration changes of H2SO4 and KOH electrolytes were recorded vs. time. The transmembrane permeability of PBI membranes was lower compared to Nafion 115, which may be ascribed to rigid backbone structures of PBI membranes, promising a higher protons diffusion barrier. Moreover, the concentration of H2SO4 and KOH electrolytes tended to be stable after 20 h. Therefore, the lower transmembrane permeability of PBI membranes alleviated the occurrence of neutralization caused by the concentration gradient. It is worth noting that the ion permeability of the membranes varies significantly with the change of applied voltage, providing an electric field force, that can not only constrain the acid/alkaline neutralization reaction, but also break the water dissociation equilibrium on the membrane surface, as well as facilitating the migration of proton and hydroxide ions along the inverse direction of the concentration gradient (Fig. S3). In general, the concentration of H2SO4 and KOH electrolytes can maintain stable during the electrolysis."
11,Acid-alkaline amphoteric water electrolysis,"3.5 Acid-alkaline amphoteric water electrolysis The acid-alkaline amphoteric water electrolysis based on a m-PBI membrane was performed at room temperature. The thickness of m-PBI and OPBI membranes were controlled to be 30 μm in the electrolysis tests. The data of the OPBI membrane and Nafion 115 membrane was also recorded for comparison. As shown in Fig. 8 a home-made single cell was filled with a 6 M KOH solution and 3 M H2SO4 solution in the cathode and anode chambers, respectively. The polarization curves obtained for the m-PBI, OPBI and Nafion 115 membranes are exhibited in Fig. 8b. The initial voltage (0.5 V) of the cell based on Nafion 115 membrane was significantly lower than that (0.8 V) of the cell based on PBI-based membranes, which could be attributed to the lower ohmic resistance of Nafion 115 compared to the PBI-based membranes. However, a higher current density could be obtained when the applied voltage of the cell exceeded 1.2 V with the application of m-PBI membranes compared to Nafion 115. According to the reported literatures, the PBI-based membranes are termed as ion-solvating membranes [47,48], which utilizing the uptake and presence of an aqueous acid electrolyte to achieve ionic conductivity instead of intrinsic ion conductors [47], thus leading to a different ion transportation mechanism from Nafion 115. The high electrolysis performance of m-PBI membrane at the applied voltage of over 1.2 V can be attributed to the effect of the electric field force, and the ion-solvating effect becomes more pronounced with the enhancement of the electric field force, which will facilitate the mass transfer in the m-PBI membrane. As shown in Fig. 8c, the durability of water electrolysis was assessed by a chronopotentiometry method. The current density increased from 10 to 100 mA cm−2 with an increment of 10 mA cm−2 per 200 s. For the m-PBI membrane, the applied voltage increased with the increase of current density in every increment, without any detectable fluctuation. However, the applied voltage of the electrolysis based on Nafion 115 membranes increased higher compared to that of m-PBI membranes with the increase of current density. Moreover, the potential became significantly increased in one increment when the current densities exceed 50 mA cm−2, which was consistent with the polarization data. This suggested that acid-alkaline amphoteric water electrolysis based on m-PBI membranes exhibited better stability and performance at the high current densities. The impact of different electrolyte concentrations on the performance of the m-PBI membrane based acid-alkaline amphoteric water electrolysis has been systematically investigated. The initial polarization curves of the m-PBI membranes with different KOH and H2SO4 concentrations were presented in Fig. 8d. It was evident that the electrolysis performance increased with upgrading concentration of H2SO4 and KOH solutions, demonstrating the electrolytes have profound effects on the ion-solvating membranes, which can be attributed to that the kinetics of electrode reactions were accelerated when the electrolytes with high concentration was used. Specially, the current density reached 300 mA cm−2 at an applied voltage of 2.0 V at room temperature when the concentration of KOH and H2SO4 was 6.0 M and 3.0 M, respectively. Furthermore, the effect of temperature on the m-PBI membrane based acid-alkaline amphoteric water electrolysis was also investigated (Fig. 9 ). As expected, the performance was improved by increasing the electrolysis temperature to 60 °C. The m-PBI membrane attained the current density of 800 mA cm−2 at an applied voltage of 2.0 V, which suggests that the m-PBI membrane based acid-alkaline amphoteric water electrolysis is the promising candidate for industrial AWE. The cell voltages of the m-PBI membrane and Nafion 115 during long-term stability tests conducted at 100 mA cm−1 at room temperature were exhibited in Fig. 10 , which are in accord with the polarization curves. The best results were obtained by the m-PBI membrane with great stability. In contrast, the applied voltage of Nafion 115 membrane gradually increased from 1.4 V to 1.7 V for 40 h, which was consistent with the results of ion permeability tests. As shown in Fig. S4, the photos of the m-PBI membrane are exhibited before and after the long-term stability test. Although the m-PBI membrane showed an obvious swelling phenomenon caused by the mechanical pressure and high concentration acid/alkaline solution for 40 h, it still exhibited the integrated membrane structure. The excellent durability of m-PBI could be attributed to high chemical stability and low ion permeability. It is well known that intensive parameters had positive impact on the performance of the m-PBI based acid-alkaline amphoteric water electrolysis. Further improvement can be achieved by utilizing a zero gap electrolyzer while the catalysts with high catalytic activity and excellent stability were employed, like FeNi hydroxide or transition metal sulfur phosphide electrodeposited on porous substrate as electrocatalysts in the anode side or cathode side [49,50]. In addition, the K+/SO4 2− selectivity of the m-PBI membrane should be further improved for highly stable operation of acid-alkaline amphoteric water electrolysis. The energy consumption of hydrogen production was also calculated and compared. For acid-alkaline amphoteric water electrolysis based on the m-PBI membrane, the energy consumption to product 1 Nm3 H2 in a standard state (273 K, 1 atm) was 3.35 kWh Nm−3, which was lower than that of Nafion 115 (3.9 kWh Nm−3) (The Faradaic efficiency towards the generation of hydrogen was considered as close to 100%). In general, the acid-alkaline amphoteric water electrolysis with m-PBI membrane show as excellent candidate for industrial water electrolysis application, especially for the reduction of energy consumption, which indeed depends upon high conductivity and stable membranes."
12,Conclusions,"m-PBI and OPBI polymers have been successfully synthesized and prepared as membranes, which possess good chemical stability in acid/alkaline solution of high concentration. Both m-PBI and OPBI membranes showed a low swelling ratio and moderate water uptake under acid aqueous solution. Moreover, the great mechanical stability of PBI-based membranes can still be maintained after treated in 6.0 M KOH aqueous solutions. The proton conductivity of the m-PBI membrane was proved significantly higher compared with the OPBI membrane, in accordance with the tendency observed in the acid doping content. m-PBI membrane plays a better role than OPBI and commercial Nafion 115 membranes in acid-alkaline amphoteric water electrolysis. The best performance was obtained through m-PBI membrane operating with 6.0 M KOH and 3.0 M H2SO4 at 60 °C, being superior compared with that of reported literatures (Table 2 ). Moreover, the electrolyser with the m-PBI membrane could be durably operated at current densities of 100 mA cm−2 for 40 h with an attracting energy consumption of 3.35 kWh m−3H2 for hydrogen production. The m-PBI membrane is expected to be a promising candidate for electrochemical device applications."
