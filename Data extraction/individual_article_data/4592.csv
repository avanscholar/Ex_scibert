0,Introduction,"Compared with natural gas reforming or gasification of coal and petroleum coke, the water electrolysis is a sustainable technology to produce hydrogen which mainly relies on renewable energy sources [1]. The development of lowcost cathode materials with high electrocatalytic activity has long been an important part of the research topics in hydrogen production by water electrolysis [2–4]. It's almost universally accepted that an increase in the electrode catalytic activity can be carried out by enlarging the actual surface area or improving its intrinsic catalytic activity. Various studies have attempted to improve the electrocatalytic activity for HER (hydrogen evolution reaction) by introducing other components into Ni as cathodes, for its low-cost characteristic and special electron structure as catalyst [5–9]. Although the multi-component materials show higher overall electrocatalytic activity than pure Ni, the reasons for this improvement are usually different. Among these researches, for instance, the superior activity for Ni–Mo, Ni–W and Ni–Fe in acidic media toward HER was found to be an increased surface roughness by leaching the active component [6], and the same situation for Ni–Zn [7], Ni–Al [8], and Ni–Mo [9] in alkaline solutions. Alternatively, the synergistic interaction between components is proven to explain the increased intrinsic activity of cathodes in HER. C. Lupi et al. [10] have prepared various compositions of Ni–Co alloys on aluminum net supports by electro-deposition, obtaining a large value of exchange current density and low hydrogen over-potential in the case of Ni concentrations ranging from 35 to 59 weight percent. Kellenberger et al. [11] have confirmed that the addition of Ti to Ni significantly reduces the electrochemical activation energy for the HER. The activity improvements are ascribed to a pronounced synergy between components as a consequence of the change in the electronic properties; and similar findings also exist between Co and Ni [12], Ni and Co–W [13], Ni and CeO2 [1], etc. Electro-deposition is a simple and inexpensive method to combine different components for purpose of synergy, as well as to enhance the actual surface of materials, thus it has traditionally been used to develop new cathodes for hydrogen evolution reaction. Nevertheless, it is hard to ensure the adherence of the deposit with the substrate while maintaining the composition of the deposit [14] by this technique. Despite the large numbers of cathodes reported so far, it should be emphasized that for the technological applications besides the electrocatalytic activity, the stability of the cathode materials in HER should also be paid attention to. Powder metallurgy is found to be a straightforward and reasonably effective approach turning the bulk alloys with excellent properties (e.g. corrosion resistance, wear ability, high strength and hardness) into porous counterparts [15–17]. The Monel alloy is well-known for its superior corrosion resistance in a reducing environment than pure Ni, and than pure Cu in an oxidizing one. Monel is widely used in nuclear and chemical industry [18–20]. Since the component for Monel is a binary Ni/Cu body with a small amount of additions, to avoid the interference of the additions on pore forming process, the binary Ni/Cu system with atomic ratio of 2:1 (Ni:Cu) is selected to fabricate a porous structure by powder metallurgy. Moreover, there are continuing reports about the synergistic effect between Ni and Cu on HER in alkaline water [21–24], most of which are based on electro-deposition method. The enlarged surface area and a fairly stable porous structure of porous Ni–Cu alloy obtained by powder metallurgy, further enlighten the authors to explore its electrocatalytic performance as electrodes. Present work concerns the electrocatalytic activity as well as the stability of porous Ni–Cu binary alloy as cathodes for the HER in 6.0 M KOH solution. The surface morphology and composition of the prepared porous Ni–Cu alloy cathode are analyzed using SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and XRD (X-ray diffraction) techniques, respectively. The kinetics of the HER on this electrode material is studied by steady-state polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements (EIS). Meantime, the stability towards HER and corrosion behavior of the porous Ni–Cu in alkaline medium during long-term operation are also investigated in detail."
1,Experimental procedure,
2,Preparation of porous Ni–Cu alloy cathode,"2.1 Preparation of porous Ni–Cu alloy cathode The commercially available nickel (median diameter: 8.2 μm) and copper powders (median diameter: 19.5 μm) with purities more than 99.7wt.% were mixed to obtain a uniform mixture of Ni-rich (67wt.%Ni–33wt.%Cu) composition. Flake compacts with dimensions of 55.0 mm × 9.0 mm × (1 ± 0.1 mm) were cold pressed at uniaxial pressure of 100 MPa. Sintering was performed in the furnace with vacuum of 1.0 × 10−4 Pa. The compacts were buried in alumina balls for homogenous heating. The heating rate was controlled within 5 °C per minute, at temperatures of 700, 800, 1000 and 1100 °C for durations of 1 h followed by furnace cooling to room temperature. The electric-arc melted dense Ni–Cu alloy (same chemical composition as porous Ni–Cu) and the dense Ni were selected for comparative study. All the samples used for following tests were rinsed with deionized water in an ultrasonic cleaner for 30 min, then degreased in anhydrous alcohol, and finally dried up in vacuum oven at 75 °C for 2 h prior to use."
3,Characterization of the porous Ni–Cu alloy cathode,"2.2 Characterization of the porous Ni–Cu alloy cathode The phase and crystal structure of the sintered porous Ni–Cu samples were analyzed by XRD (D/max 2550VB with Cu Kα radiation). The morphology of the material was characterized by SEM (JSM-6360LV, 20 kV). The pore size distribution was determined by the use of mercury intrusion (Pore Master 33 GT, Quantachrome Instruments). Archimedes principle was employed to measure the open porosity of porous samples. The N2 permeate flux of porous structure was measured through bubble test [25]. The tensile strength and transverse rupture strength of the porous Ni–Cu alloy were tested by an Electric Servo-hydraulic Material Test system (INSTRON 3369). CV (Cyclic voltammetry) curves, cathodic polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques were used to characterize the electrochemical performance of the porous Ni–Cu alloy electrode in 6.0 M KOH solution, with a geometric surface area of 1.0 cm2 exposed to the solution. Pt foil and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. A salt bridge made by polytetrafluoroethylene was used to reduce the liquid junction potential. The Luggin capillary was arranged as closely as possible to the working electrode in order to minimize errors due to IR drop in solutions. Steady-state CV curves were recorded in 6.0 mol/L KOH solution at a series of scan rates of 0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30 and 0.40 V s−1. Cathodic polarization curves were recorded in potassium hydroxide solution at a scan rate of 0.001 V s−1. The EIS measurements were conducted at different cathodic overpotentials in the frequency range of 100 kHz–0.01 Hz, with the perturbation amplitude of 0.005 V."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Characterization of porous Ni–Cu alloy cathode,"3.1 Characterization of porous Ni–Cu alloy cathode The surface morphology of the green compact and the sintered Ni–Cu alloy is exhibited by SEM, as shown in Fig. 1 a and b, respectively. Mixed metal powders are merely mechanically pressed together in the green compact, which has a low strength and an open porosity of 15.2%. The porosity of green compact is mainly composed by the interstitial pores formed between powder particles. Powder metallurgy affords good controls of the porous structure of porous materials. The pore morphology is dependent on factors such as pressing pressure, sintering conditions (temperature and time), particle size and shape of metal powder. Abundant interconnected pores and the generally smooth pore walls can be seen in the sintered Ni–Cu alloy porous structure (Fig. 1b), which has a most probable pore size of 2.4 μm, measured by mercury intrusion method. The N2 permeate flux is 28.5 m3 h−1 kPa−1 m−2 for the thickness of 1.8 mm by bubble test. The pore size distribution (Fig. 1c) displays a significant narrow peak at the size of 2.4 μm, indicating a homogenous porous structure is formed. The XRD patterns of the fabricated porous Ni–Cu alloy and green compact are shown in Fig. 1d. A Ni–Cu solid solution alloy is obtained after sintering, which has the same FCC structure as that of pure Ni and Cu. The decrease of the surface freedom energy of powder compacts, together with the Kirkendall effect caused by the huge discrepancy of mutual diffusion coefficients between Ni and Cu, determines the evolution of pores in the porous Ni–Cu in the sintering process [26–28]. The porous samples in this research have an open porosity over 31.5% and closed porosity of less than 2.7%, and the numerous interconnected pores considerably enlarge the actual surface area of porous Ni–Cu alloy."
6,Electro-catalytic evolution of hydrogen on porous Ni–Cu alloy cathode,"3.2 Electro-catalytic evolution of hydrogen on porous Ni–Cu alloy cathode 3.2.1 Actual surface area of electrodes The roughness factor of the fabricated porous Ni–Cu alloy, dense Ni and dense Ni–Cu alloy are evaluated by comparing their double layer capacitance measured by cyclic voltammogram (CV) with ideal value 20 μF cm−2 [29]. Fig. 2 a is the representative CV curves of the porous Ni–Cu in 6.0 M KOH solution at different sweeping rates. It is depicted that stationary double layer currents appear between the potential ranging from −0.30 V to −0.18 V vs. SCE. In this region, the average of capacitive current ( j d l , a v e ) is proportional to the double layer capacitance (C dl ), and the average of double layer current densities as a function of potential sweep rate can be described as followed [30,31]: (1) j d l , a v e = | j c | + | j a | 2 = C d l d E d t where j c and j a are cathodic and anodic current density, respectively. The capacitances of the three electrodes can be estimated from the slopes in the plots of current density against sweeping rate, as shown in Fig. 2b. The relative magnitude of the respective roughness factor, R f , is considered to be the actual active surface area of the catalytic material [31]. The calculated results are summarized in Table 1 . It shows that the actual surface of the sintered porous Ni–Cu fabricated by powder metallurgy increases tremendously than the dense Ni–Cu alloy, owing to the interconnected micro-sized pores formed during the sintering process. 3.2.2 The hydrogen evolution performance of porous Ni–Cu alloy cathode The cathodic polarization curves for HER of three electrodes in 6.0 M KOH are illustrated in Fig. 3 . The onset potential of HER mostly reflects the reaction activity of cathode in water electrolysis process. For this research, it is obtained by intercepting the extrapolated current baseline with the prolonged tangent at the liner region of cathodic polarization curve. The gradient d j / d E of the porous Ni–Cu cathode is much steeper than the dense Ni–Cu and dense Ni in the hydrogen evolution process. Furthermore, the measured onset potential of porous Ni–Cu for HER is much more positive, which makes generation of hydrogen easily under lower overpotential, as compared with dense Ni–Cu and dense Ni electrodes. At the polarization potential of −1.6 V, the cathodic current density of porous Ni–Cu is 151 mA cm−2, about 120 mA cm−2 and 65 mA cm−2 higher than that of dense Ni and dense Ni–Cu alloy, respectively. The apparent exchange current density j 0 can directly reflect the depolarization ability of cathode for HER, which can be reasonably taken as a measurement of the catalytic efficiency. It is derived directly from the intercept by the extrapolation of Tafel slope to equilibrium potential based on its relationship with overpotential described as [32]: (2) η = a + b log j 0 Where η is the overpotential for HER; a and b are Tafel intercept and Tafel slope, respectively. The effective exchange current density (j 0 /R f ) based on the actual surface area R f offers a more comprehensive understanding about the electro-catalysis intrinsic activities of cathode material [33]. The effective exchange current densities for three electrodes are calculated, as shown in Table 1. The effective exchange current density (j 0 /R f ) for HER on the porous Ni–Cu alloy electrode is 2.24 × 10−3 mA cm−2, obviously higher than the dense Ni electrode 4.28 × 10−4 mA cm−2, showing that the intrinsic activity of the porous Ni–Cu alloy is remarkably higher than dense Ni. Besides, this value is comparable to those found for Ni–Co alloys [12] in 30% KOH at 25 °C, chemically treated Ni–Zr electrode [34] and porous Ni–Ti in 1.0 M NaOH at 25 °C [35]. However, it is lower than that of the Ni-Mn-Zn [36], electrodeposited Ni-Mo [9] and Ni–Co in situ activated with Mo [12]. Obviously, the presence of Cu leads to a considerable increase of intrinsic activity, as shown by the j 0 /R f value of dense Ni–Cu, which is about 5 times higher than that of dense Ni electrode. As expected, the porous Ni–Cu electrode shows a better activity than dense counterpart during the HER owing to the increase of actual surface area, despite the high Tafel slope. The greater hydrogen evolution activity of porous Ni–Cu alloy for HER can be ascribed to both the large electrochemical actual surface area and the synergistic effect after alloying Ni with Cu. Generally, the value of Tafel slope is related to the mechanism of hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline solution. As shown in Table 1, the Tafel slopes for the porous Ni–Cu, dense Ni–Cu and Ni electrode are 218, 149 and 107 mV dec−1, respectively. The Tafel slope for porous cathode is obviously higher than dense cathodes during HER. The increase of Tafel slope during hydrogen evolution reaction has also been reported on other porous materials [35,37,38], which may be caused by the diffusional limiting process with respect to the complex and irregular porous structures [31,35]. The product of gas bubbles is an additional impediment which contributes to the concentration polarization and ohmic resistance inside the pores [35]. Mathematical models also predict the increase or even doubling of the Tafel slope for porous materials during the HER process [39]. 3.2.3 EIS test of porous Ni–Cu alloy cathode Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a very sensitive technique for understanding the electrode reactions on porous electrodes [40]. The representative Nyquist plots of the porous Ni–Cu electrode at different overpotentials near the hydrogen evolution region are presented in Fig. 4 a; phase angle-frequency plots for the same system are shown in Fig. 4b. Hollow symbols represent experimental points, while solid lines represent fitting results. It can be seen from Fig. 4a that the EIS behavior of porous Ni–Cu is dependent on the electrolysis potential. As the overpotential increase, the diameter of the semicircle observed in the Nyquist plots decreases. The equivalent circuit for modeling the electrochemical impedance data is presented as inset in Fig. 4a. The EIS data obtained at different potentials are well fitted by 2-CPE model [41], predicting the formation of two partially overlapped semicircles, with the HF (high frequency) semicircle related to the porous structure of electrodes and the LF (low frequency) semicircle to the faradic process [42]. Two peaks are observed in the phase angle-frequency plots corresponding to the two semicircles appearing in Nyquist plots. However, the peak at LF is gradually not distinguishable as the overpotential increases, which makes a deformed semicircle in the Nyquist plot. The deformed semicircle appears at high overpotential in the impedance spectra has also been reported on skeleton NiTi [11], Raney-nickel composite coated electrodes [43,44]. Table 2 reports the corresponding parameter values obtained from the experimental impedance data fitted on porous Ni–Cu at different overpotentials. Where Rs is solution resistance; CPE (constant phase element) is related to the double-layer capacity of the electrodes; R 1 and R 2 are related to the porous structure and the kinetics of the Faradaic reaction of the HER, respectively. As it is seen from Table 2, R 1 value almost remains constant, and the CPE-1 behaves as ideal capacitor; however, both CPE-2 and R 2 value decrease with increasing overpotential. The decreased CPE-2 is most likely due to the blockage of adsorbed hydrogen on the surface [24]. The low charge transfer resistance R 2 at high potential is in accordance with the observed high exchange current density for HER. The values of time dependent parameter n are approximately equal to 1.0 indicating a homogenous surface of the porous electrodes. It is generally accepted that the HER on transition metals in alkaline solution goes through the usual Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism [45]. It can be written as: H2O + M + e− → M-Hads + OH− (I) Volmer step M-Hads + H2O + e− → M + H2 + OH− (II) Heyrovsky step Where M is a free site on the metal surface and MHads is the metal surface occupied by hydrogen adatoms. It can be derived from the EIS study that, as the overpotential increases, the low frequency semicircle in the impedance plots becomes smaller and smaller, indicating that the adsorption process is promoted and the charge transfer process dominates the impedance response as the overpotential increases [46]. Hence, the hydrogen evolution reaction on porous Ni–Cu alloy is controlled by Heyrovsky step."
7,The effect of temperature on the electro-catalysis activity of cathodes,"3.3 The effect of temperature on the electro-catalysis activity of cathodes For this study, the cathode polarization curves on porous Ni–Cu at temperatures ranging from 35 °C to 75 °C are recorded. Linear regions of Tafel plots at different temperatures are demonstrated in the inset of Fig. 5 a. As temperature increases, the overpotential evidently decreases at the same current density, and the onset potential of HER shifts to positive direction. The exchange current density is extrapolated from Tafel plot according to equation (2), and the relationship between j 0 and T for HER is exhibited in Fig. 5b. It is shown that the increase of temperature promotes the HER activity of both porous Ni–Cu and dense Ni. The curve of log j 0 against T −1 exhibits a linear relationship in Fig. 5b. Substituting the slope value into Arrhenius equation (3) [47], the apparent activation energies (Ea) for HER of two electrodes are obtained and presented in Table 3 . (3) log j 0 = log A − E a 2.303 R 1 T The calculated value of apparent activation energy for the porous Ni–Cu is 26.7 kJ mol−1, lower than that of dense Ni (44.1 kJ mol−1), dense Ni–Cu (32.6 kJ mol−1), and reported porous Ni3Al (30.1 kJ mol−1) [30], Ni–Fe (31 kJ mol−1) [48], and comparable to that of electrodeposited Ni–Mo alloy [49]. It indicates a lower energy barrier of HER on the porous Ni–Cu electrode in alkaline solution. This result further proves the high electro–catalytic activity of the sintered porous Ni–Cu from the viewpoint of dynamics. However, the value of Ea is still higher than ternary Ni–Mo–Cu (21 kJ mol−1) [50] cathode for HER at the same electrolysis condition, which prompts that the addition of active component Mo to the porous Ni–Cu alloy may help decrease the apparent activation energy during HER."
8,The electrochemical stability of porous Ni–Cu alloy cathode,"3.4 The electrochemical stability of porous Ni–Cu alloy cathode The electrochemical stability of electrode is investigated by recording CV curves in 6.0 M KOH at the region of −0.9 to −1.8 V at 298 K at the scanning rate of 1 mV s−1 for 500 cycles. As shown in Fig. 6 , there is only 3.3% current decay for porous Ni–Cu yet a 38.0% current decay as for dense Ni after 500 cycles CV tests. The surface morphology of porous Ni–Cu after test is shown in Fig. 7 a, which shows the skeleton still in its original state. From energy spectrum (Fig. 7b) analysis, no adhering impurity exists on the surface of the cathode material, reflecting that the current interruption has no impact on the alloy electrode's catalytic activity and surface morphology. For the electrodes obtained by electro-deposition, previous studies show that electro-deposited coating will be peeled off from substrate during short running cycles because of the entrance of hydrogen, causing permanent destruction of electrodes [51]. However, the interconnected pores of the porous Ni–Cu make the hydrogen escape smoothly from the pore channels, retaining the integrity of the porous skeleton. Under this consideration, optimizing average diameter of the pore channels, as well as increasing actual surface of the porous structure of the sintered Ni–Cu for HER application will be one subject of our further researches. The characteristic of net-shape forming by powder metallurgy provides advantages such as structure stability and easy manufacture of materials, which can seldom be obtained by other techniques for electrode fabrication. Meanwhile, the inherent characteristics of metal ensure excellent strength of the porous Ni–Cu, with the transverse rupture strength and tensile strength at room temperature 140.5 MPa and 73.1 MPa, respectively. Sufficient strength of the material can afford more severe operating condition during the hydrogen produce by water electrolysis."
9,The corrosion resistance of porous Ni–Cu alloy in KOH solution,"3.5 The corrosion resistance of porous Ni–Cu alloy in KOH solution Although a promising electrocatalytical performance is observed for porous Ni–Cu cathode, it remains to be seen if this material will have sufficient resilience to chemical attack by the caustic solution over long period of service. The Nyquist and Bode plots are given in Fig. 8 a and b for the porous Ni–Cu cathode in 6.0 M KOH solution at 25 °C after 5 and 36 h of exposure (at open circuit conditions). Two time constants can be seen from the Bode plots, corresponding to the two capacitive loops in the Nyquist plots. The appearance of the first loop at high frequencies is related to the porous structure, which is independent on the exposure time. The second capacitive loop is attributed to the charge transfer resistance, which corresponds to metal dissolution process, indicating that the corrosion reaction of the electrode is charge transfer controlled. The polarization resistances of the porous Ni–Cu electrode in 6.0 M KOH solution are also determined and found to be 1080 and 2240 Ω cm−2 after 5 and 36 h of exposure, respectively. The increasing corrosion resistance with exposure time may be related to the growth of protective oxide and/or hydroxide products of nickel (NiO, Ni(OH)2, NiOOH) and copper (Cu2O, CuO, Cu(OH)2) [22,52,53] during immersion. The variation of the open circuit potential (Eocp) with time for porous Ni–Cu as long as 60 h is recorded in Fig. 8c, parallel experiments show the same feature of change. The Eocp values of the porous Ni–Cu electrode are −0.32 and −0.19 V after 5 and 36 h of exposure, respectively. The positive variation of open circuit potential is due to the formation of a passive oxide layer over the electrode surface."
10,Conclusions,"The porous Ni–Cu alloy with an open porosity of 31.5% was fabricated by powder metallurgy, and its activity as well as stability as cathode for the HER was studied by cathodic polarization curves, EIS and CV techniques. An increase in electrocatalytic activity was observed for the porous Ni–Cu alloy electrode compared with dense nickel, due to the enlarged active surface area and the increased intrinsic catalytic activity after introducing Cu into Ni. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the sintered porous Ni–Cu alloy cathode has excellent stability during HER, almost completely retaining its current density, even after 500 cycles. The excellent electrocatalytic and chemical stability make the fabricated porous Ni–Cu material a potential compound as cathode in alkaline water electrolysis. Present research encourages more efforts to study the porous Ni–Cu binary alloy system for HER, the effect of alloy composition on the strength of M-Hads, as well as the influence of pore structure of the sintered porous Ni–Cu material on the hydrogen production by water electrolysis."
